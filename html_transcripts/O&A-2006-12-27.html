<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with an analysis of a 51-year-old woman's online dating profile, Patty's, which the hosts subjected to vulgar and sexually charged ridicule.  This segment involved a caller, Tim from Kalamazoo, who claimed to have extraordinarily large testicles.  Patty, prompted by the hosts,  examined and even touched Tim's testicles, a moment met with crude jokes and sexually suggestive commentary from the hosts. The hosts then guided Patty in using a dildo, providing explicit instructions and further crude humor.  Technical difficulties with the microphones were also noted during this portion.  Later, the show featured Patty, revealed to be a virgin, using a vibrator while the hosts and callers offered increasingly graphic commentary and instructions, culminating in Patty experiencing an orgasm.  Co-host Jimmy also briefly touched Patty's breasts.

The show then shifted to reminiscences about juvenile pranks committed by the hosts and their friends (Stanley, Mike, Looch, and Marvin), detailing numerous outrageous and often illegal acts involving bodily fluids and other projectiles targeted at unsuspecting individuals.  This was followed by a scathing and mocking review of Rosie O'Donnell's movie "Riding the Bus With My Sister," focusing on its portrayal of a character with Down syndrome (Corky), utilizing derogatory terms to describe the acting and plot.  This segment also included audio clips from the film and interviews, along with calls from listeners, one of whom shared their perspective as someone with a sister with intellectual disabilities.  The discussion frequently veered into sexually explicit tangents.  Interspersed throughout were commercials for XM Satellite Radio, promoting their country music, NHL hockey, and college sports programming. The show also included analysis of an ambiguous-gendered American Idol contestant, with equally offensive commentary on their appearance and performance.  There were also segments discussing the cost of accessing certain websites on mobile phones.

A later segment began with unintelligible ramblings, then transitioned to a promotional video of producer Steve C. portraying a school bully offering drugs to children, surprisingly followed by the promotion of pornography as a drug deterrent.  The bulk of this segment focused on Bob Kelly's recounting of his "snuba" experience, involving exaggerated underwater encounters and frequent interruptions, punctuated by off-color jokes and insults.  A caller corrected Bob Kelly on the Titanic's length.  More XM radio advertisements aired, this time including promotions for country music, NASCAR, NHL coverage, and a video-sharing website.  The show also featured a studio recording of a heated, profanity-laced argument between members of The Troggs, followed by a snippet of one of their songs and discussion of their other hits. John Cena's voice was briefly heard at the end of this section.

The final segment began with a crude father-son phone conversation detailing a past sexual encounter and its punishment.  The conversation then shifted to mockery of Mike Brady from *The Brady Bunch*, followed by a live, aggressive, and profane musical performance of a song titled "M-O-P-M-N-8" with repeated declarations of "People equals shit." The segment concluded with a comedic appearance by Richard Cheese, who sarcastically announced the end of "The Worst of Opie and Anthony."

You're sadly mistaken.  That mic's broken.  Get another mic.  And get the fucking thing.  The mic on the other thing.  The thing.  Move over and give it a shot.  E-Rock's trying to figure out which guy has the big ball.  Just look at the fucking crotch.  No.  No.  Right there buddy.

Now I bet it works.  Yeah it's on.  I heard it.  Talk into it.  Hey.  There you go.  See it just needed to be thrown against the wall.  Turn it up.  Good to go?  Yeah.  No.  Now it's off again. 
[00:09:00]  I can't hear it.  I like this one better.  It might have a loose connection now.  What's your name?  I'm Tim.  Kalamazoo.  Tim and you say you have exceptionally large testicles?  Not large.  Long.  Long.  Long.  Yeah.  Wrecking balls.  Wrecking balls.  Taffy balls.  He's got taffy balls.  I don't even know how this began.  We were discussing something and all of a sudden Tim called and said he's got big ones and this  might start some crazy contests.  Some click clack nuts.  I mean.  Just really hang low. 
[00:09:30]  I don't necessarily want to win anything.  I understand.  He's going to show his balls.  Well, Patty, you've got to look at these.  Patty, yeah.  You've got to look at his balls.  Stop looking straight ahead like you were the fucking rape victim in the Kennedy trial.  This is a live version of gay or funny, by the way.  This could be either very funny or very gay.  It's not gay to look at a guy's balls.  Patty's in the room.  All right, Patty.  Are you excited to see if it's gay?  Some hangers?  How many balls have you seen in your life, Patty?  Not many.  How many have you had on your nose?  Maybe I snuck looks at some movies and stuff like that if they came on. 
[00:10:00]  Some pornos, snuck looks.  When I had the independent film channel.  Ew, you'd sneak a peek at a balls?  Well, no.  Unsexy idiots?  On IFC?  What kind of balls are they selling on IFC?  Probably some Discovery Channel thing.  It was an orangutan.  She snuck a peek at his balls.  Who's the rapper with the big balls?  I mean, pictures like that and stuff don't bother me.  It's doing bad. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  Do you look at a dog's balls and go like, oh, they kind of look like people balls?  Well, a dog's set, but not those kind of dogs.  And you touch them, you juggle them around a little.  You're talking about a mastiff or something.  All right, you ready to look?  I'm not talking about anything.  Why does he have to be in here?  Me too.  Oh, okay.  But maybe he doesn't want to look at the balls.  He doesn't have a choice.  Johnny?  Comment?  John, do you have to look at this guy's balls? 
[00:11:00]  No, I'm good.  I didn't even know you guys were showing balls today.  I would have stepped in.  Do we have another cordless mic?  What did E-Rock bring you in for, bro?  He just said shift mic.  Oh.  Do we have another mic?  Hold the mic while I do this.  Where's the other mic?  All right.  All right.  E-Rock's going to work the power talk.  So you're going to be working that mic, I guess, between Mr. Balls and Patty and things like  that.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go.  Yeah.  So pick it up, I guess.  There you go.  And see that heavy bass? 
[00:11:30]  Bash it over Patty's head.  No.  Johnny.  Look at Patty actually winced.  Patty.  As if it was happening.  Patty, don't worry.  What a freak.  Patty, don't worry.  No one will miss you.  Her scared face.  It makes me want to bite her.  Doesn't it?  The more scared, like I understand serial killers.  Yeah.  When, only with her.  Like I can look at her when she's frightened and just want to scare her more.  And when she's pained, I want more pain for her.  I understand.  You make people understand serial killers. 
[00:12:00]  Mar, sorry I broke your mic.  You didn't.  It wasn't working.  It really wasn't your fault.  It was broken up.  I think it was more that someone didn't turn it on.  I actually fixed it for a second.  All right.  So Patty, get ready to see the big ball.  Patty, turn around.  Take a look.  Look right at his groin.  Don't shield your eyes.  Is that mic working now, Hawk?  I'm on stage right here.  Hold on.  I got a video camera of him.  Dude, give him the mic.  Is that one working?  Is that one working?  You hear me?  Yeah.  Hello?  Something weird going on there. 
[00:12:30]  Okay, let him talk.  Just relax.  Just relax.  Oh, look.  He's all fucking making excuses already.  I got the camera.  All right, relax.  There's the view right there.  We don't care about video balls.  Yeah, Patty will tug on them and make them lower.  Yeah, Patty, he might have to warm his nuts up.  Why is there an echo, echo, echo?  We're doing a CBS FM 101.5.  Slam by all.  Talk into that mic.  The Jersey guys.  You're working, man.  Yeah.  I hear it like in one ear.  Yeah, it's phasing.  That's good.  That'll work.  Why would it work properly?  Opie, maybe you should fix that mic. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I hope he's a mic fixer.  It worked good on the first one.  What?  It worked good on the first one to throw it across the room.  Yeah.  That is weird.  It's like a slight delay or something when he talks.  All right, let's do the ball thing.  Go ahead, Patty.  All right, Patty, take a look at the sack.  Now, Patty, if they're not the biggest you've ever seen, just think I'm white.  That's going to...  I got a bad laugh.  That's all right.  All right, Patty, ready?  All right, Patty, ready?  He's pulling them through.  Just pull the whole thing out.  We don't care.  No one gives a shit. 
[00:13:30]  Patty, look, they're hanging.  They're hanging.  They're going to stay going.  Those are low hangers.  Hey, Patty, I mean, you can touch them.  Patty, you got to cup them, but don't squeeze them.  Because they get bigger if you cup them.  Just cup them gently.  I've got them on videotape, much larger than this.  Let Patty touch them.  Patty, warm them up.  Cup them gently.  Just a little touch.  Just cup them gently.  Cup them.  I don't have diseases.  And then go up, up, up and down with them a little bit.  Most of them are communicable.  Cup them.  Patty, just gently with your hand and then up and down a little.  We're not going to hurt you, Patty. 
[00:14:00]  Just balls.  Who cares?  That'll make you feel better.  Just cup them.  My mom will be proud.  Come on, Patty.  Go ahead, Patty.  Go ahead, Patty.  Cup them.  No, Patty, you're not cupping.  Don't just tap it.  Patty, cup them with the palm of your hand and push up.  You're not a basketball.  Patty, look like this, like with the orange.  Oh, Jesus.  Now, go ahead.  There you go.  Now, go ahead.  Hold them, Patty.  No, you got to push up.  You're just touching scrote.  Yeah, push up.  Push up.  A little more, Patty.  I touched more than I ever did.  Just push up on a push up. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, that's it.  See, they're harmless, Patty.  They're just squishing.  They're harmless.  Let them sit in your hand like a bean bag.  You can grab them and stretch them.  Hold them.  Yeah, Patty, tuck them around a little.  They don't come off.  They don't come off.  Just tug it around.  Yeah, pull it.  They stay right there.  Pull it.  There you go.  There you go.  Now, that's what I needed.  That was my whole morning.  Patty, pull it.  You got to pull the skin a little bit.  Yeah, pull the sack a little.  Make a bat wing.  I had a toast.  Make a bat wing.  I like it rough.  Come on.  Now, make a bat wing.  Take the skin and pull it out a little bit. 
[00:15:00]  Pull it out.  Like, grab the skin.  Oh.  Pull it out.  See?  This is the first time you've ever touched those, right?  One more time.  One more time.  All right.  Come on.  Pull.  Patty, just pull the skin.  Oh, bag.  Pull the skin.  Pull the skin.  Oh.  I'm just kidding.  Now, Patty, go ahead.  Patty, pull the skin.  Pull it out now.  Pull it.  A little harder.  Harder.  Come on.  Just pull.  Now, punch him as hard as you can, right?  Fucking ball.  Now, Patty, here's what you got to do.  You got to pick him up in your hand and hold him like this orange. 
[00:15:30]  Like, you just got to hold him like that.  Like a doctor holds.  Like a doctor.  Just hold him.  Hold the whole bag.  Let me show you.  And then have the guy cough.  Look at that.  Yeah, hold him, Patty.  Two hangers.  Hold him.  Now, cough.  Now, hold him in your palm, Patty.  I feel like I'm being molested.  See?  But that's so harmless.  Like a two-year-old.  Like, what did someone do for the first time?  Now, kiss him.  There you go.  They got a little weight to him, right?  What are you thinking right now?  What are you feeling?  Pat from Inaki suggesting that she pops them like bubble wrap. 
[00:16:00]  No, no.  Hold him.  Hold him.  I want to ask you a question while you're holding him.  All right, Patty.  Just lick the ball.  Just cough.  No, just hold it.  All right.  Hold it.  Just hold it.  Go ahead.  Now, what are you thinking right now as you're holding it?  I've never done anything like this before.  How does it feel?  How does it feel?  Weird.  Weird?  Like, what's the skin feel like?  Skin.  Just normal skin.  No.  What does it feel like?  What's in there?  What's in the skin?  Like, what does that all feel like in your hand? 
[00:16:30]  Is it hairy?  What does it feel like?  There's no hair.  All right.  What does it feel like?  There's a little hair.  It just feels like heavy and lumpy.  Cup him.  Cup him.  You're not cupping him.  Heavy and lumpy.  Yeah, get him.  I don't know what else to do.  But, yeah, Patty, do this.  Do this.  Take your fingers and kind of massage them around a little bit.  Yeah, like Captain Queeg.  Yeah.  I knew it was a key for the strawberries.  Strawberries.  How many portions did you have?  Yeah, come on, old Yellowstain.  I never ran over that toe cable. 
[00:17:00]  All right, get it, Patty.  One last to feel.  This is it.  Old Yellowstain.  You're making this less gay, though, Patty.  I'll give you the no-homber right here.  Come on, before Fred McMurray comes in.  Roll them around in your hand a little bit.  No, no.  You like those Chinese balls.  Patty, close your hand on them.  Close your hand on them a little.  On both of them.  And now kind of just roll your fingers around.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, there you go.  They're bigger than her hands.  There you go.  Now you're juggling some balls there, Patty.  Yeah, so what?  Who cares?  There you go. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Having fun, right?  Now what you do is hold them again.  Hold them.  It's fine.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad you thought.  No, you keep letting go.  Now you snake another finger under the crotch, and you put it in the backside.  You wet your finger, and you snake it under the crotch, and you put it in the shitter.  That's only for Australian girls.  Okay.  Can I get some hand, Joe?  No, you can't.  Smell your hand.  Can you stay on my balls?  Yeah, smell your hand.  Smell your left hand.  Tell us what it smells like.  Smell your hand.  What does it smell like?  It smells like balls. 
[00:18:00]  I want some hand, Joe.  What does it smell like?  Not yet.  What does it smell like?  No, you've got to tell us what it smells like.  Yeah, if you tell us.  Smell it.  I don't know what this...  I don't know.  Put your nose by his balls.  What does that smell like?  What does that smell like?  I showered this morning, Patty.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It should have come after, like, a nice fucking week-long run.  Is there anything you can equate that smell to in nature?  Rub the balls again, Patty.  You didn't rub them right.  You rub them.  Did the guy get any action out of that? 
[00:18:30]  No.  I get you.  You know you've got to do it, Patty.  Rub between his thigh and ball bag.  That might be good.  And then give us a little...  Tell us.  What it smells like.  Go ahead.  Hey, I'm a little sweaty after the day, you know?  No, you're fine.  Go ahead.  Patty, you're going to slide in.  Rub in there.  I've got a little more.  I've had physicals before.  He's fine.  Under the bag, Patty.  By the way, Patty...  Now go between the thigh and ball bag with a couple of fingers and just rub in there.  Wait a minute.  Patty, I'm a paid whore. 
[00:19:00]  No, his ass is behind him, you dummy.  Relax.  You're not touching his ass.  Hold them.  No, underneath.  But you've got to rub harder because you've got to, like, get something on your fingers.  No, Patty...  No, wait a minute.  No.  You get pregnant that way.  She goes, no, I'll get pregnant that way.  How do you get pregnant?  Holy shit, you blithering fucking idiot.  How do you get pregnant?  No.  He's not going to shoot a load.  He's not even fucking hard, you idiot.  Relax.  She thinks he's going to shoot a load out of his ball bag. 
[00:19:30]  That's going to go into your pants and try to pry open your veg?  No, in between the ball bag and thigh.  And the thigh.  Let me show you.  Do you want me to move your hand for you?  Show her where.  She ain't going to hurt you, Patty.  I don't hurt you.  She's saying, like, here.  Right there.  Underneath a little bit.  There you go.  There you go.  Now rub.  Now rub.  It's not going to be rubbing.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Dig around.  Grab this thing.  Just rub your fingers.  Rub them.  Be rub.  Yeah.  Now we're talking.  Now you're good.  There you go.  All right. 
[00:20:00]  Now smell your fingers real quick.  Get up there by your nose.  It smells a little sweaty.  Well, I've never.  It does smell something.  But it does.  Get it closer to your nose.  Yeah.  What does it mean?  What do you mean sweaty?  It has to smell like something.  Like, I don't know.  Like what?  Uh, I can't describe it.  Of course you can.  I don't have words.  Yeah.  No, you don't.  By the way, what are we celebrating today? 
[00:20:30]  AIDS Day.  AIDS Day.  That's why he's here.  He's been HIV positive for 10 years.  You just touched the guy's balls that actually has AIDS.  Congratulations.  I hope that I don't have so many cuts on your hands.  Welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS.  That should be okay.  Go ahead.  Thanks a lot for coming in, man.  I appreciate it.  That guy was cool.  Good luck with the AIDS, man.  Yeah, you'll be good.  Can I get my Purell out of my pocket?  No, no, no.  No, it doesn't cure AIDS.  That doesn't even help you.  Well, I want to wash my hands.  You can wait a minute.  It's too late. 
[00:21:00]  You might have a little on you now.  That's what that sweaty smell is.  Yeah, AIDS.  Don't touch your eyes.  Yeah, it's through the sweat glands, you idiot.  Yeah, don't touch your eyes.  It's all right.  Well, maybe not.  Guys, I tell you, you did loosen his bag up, though.  Yeah.  I think you're like an old bag loosener from way back.  You're a pro.  No one will believe that's the first bag you've ever loosened.  Patty, did that make you feel in any way?  Did you feel like a thrill sexually in any way? 
[00:21:30]  Any way.  Be honest.  I don't think so.  You don't think so?  No, because it was kind of weird.  Now I'm afraid I have AIDS.  Relax.  A lot of times you don't get it that way.  Can't wait until Drew Boogie's next remix on Patty.  She said some great shit.  She's going to have a great promo.  A lot of times people don't get AIDS that way.  Yeah.  Totally sometimes.  Most of the time.  Honestly, to be fair, it's like 1 in 50, something like that.  So, you know.  Don't even worry about it.  There's a slight change.  No, no, it's more than that because she rubbed under the balls. 
[00:22:00]  She actually did a rub between the balls.  And that's where AIDS is known to collect.  Do you got liquid on your hand?  She got sweat.  You could smell it on your hand.  That's what that was.  That's where it comes to the glance.  Sweaty.  Yeah, I would really like to use some Purell.  That won't matter.  That'll actually make it worse.  Yeah, Purell actually makes AIDS stronger.  The reason it makes it worse is because it's...  No, no, listen to me.  It closes your pores up, which keeps anything from evaporating out.  Trust me, that's what it does.  That's why it's bad for you in the long run.  If you've got something like that, you've got to leave it.  Because if you put Purell on your hands, it will close the pores.  And that means anything that would have evaporated off your fingers will not evaporate off your fingers. 
[00:22:30]  That's why you don't use it.  Yeah, Jim speaks the truth.  Yes.  That's how it works.  What about soap and water?  By the way, all the Starbucks muffins are going to smell like onion.  No.  That'll just soak in there.  I didn't order an onion muffin.  No, they're not.  Now, Patty, you've got to grab that thing.  All right, yeah, now we've got to do this thing.  Yeah, now, Patty, we've got to do the other thing.  But I do have to wash my hands before I do that because I'm coming in contact with myself.  Yeah, that's true.  And I want to be safe.  Well, you could get pregnant.  You might get pregnant, yeah.  You know you could get pregnant, right?  That is so funny. 
[00:23:00]  She thought a load was going to shoot out of his bag or something.  Do you know where that comes from?  Do you know where a guy shoots his load from?  Yeah, the penis.  It comes through little sacks inside with tubes.  Do you know where it actually comes out of on the penis?  Like where it's stored.  The tip.  Okay, very good.  Do you know where it's stored in the body?  In glands.  Ball bag.  In girls' mouths.  Would you have held those testicles in your mouth?  I'm like, oh. 
[00:23:30]  No.  No.  What's the difference?  Hand, mouth?  Yeah.  No, I'm not.  Would you have, would you, would you have.  Only people that work in brothels and stuff like that.  Brothels.  Okay, Miss 1870.  I can't believe you just touched a stranger's balls.  Patty, would you have touched his penis?  Yeah, of course you would have.  It's right there, just above it.  Would you have, like, rested that in your hand?  Uh, no.  But I don't know.  I think you would have.  Go wash your hands so we can shut this thing up here.  Wash your hand, and then you'll take care of business. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead, AIDS.  Open the door with your left fucking hand.  Don't leave AIDS on the door.  Thank you.  All right, she's going to wash her hands.  Is that off outside?  What a dope.  She's one of the most sexually moronic people ever, ever, ever.  All right.  That's great.  Now we got the, uh, no, she's washing her hands.  Tell her to hurry up, because she's the grand finale today.  And then she's going to try to put that.  That's very thin. 
[00:24:30]  That dildo is, uh, what is that?  Three quarters of an inch across?  Yeah, it's the basic one, I guess.  It's an ass dildo, pretty much.  You know.  That's, that, she ain't even going to be able to fucking deal with that.  Can I see that?  No, vibrate.  What are you going to do?  Rub your dick all over it.  Go ahead, rub, rub it on your dick, Jimmy.  Quick, quick.  Give it to him.  Give it to him.  I'm on your dick.  Give it to him.  Make sure she doesn't come in.  Make sure she doesn't come in. 
[00:25:00]  No, you put the palco, Tyron, down.  Look.  Look at what I'm doing.  Rub it all over it.  Here you go.  Don't let her come in yet.  Oh, Christ.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get a good one.  Get it all under your bag.  Yeah, hello, virgin.  What do you think of them apples?  Nice and sweaty.  Wait, under my balls.  Hold on.  Yeah, get your taint.  Oh, let me rub my, I'm rubbing it in my crack.  Yeah.  In my, in my asshole. 
[00:25:30]  That a girl.  Oh, shit.  Cool.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  All right, we'll take a break, and we'll continue with this mess next.  The best of the work of O.P. and Anthony.  God almighty, I challenge you to not vomit.  Radio for Dummies.  O.P. and Anthony.  You know what, Pop?

Though occasionally helpful, bank overdraft protection programs can also hurt, mostly in the wallet area. 
[00:28:00]  The FDIC is considering a study for next year that would examine five such programs, and they're used by consumers.  I'm Shana Steiner with the Bankrate.com Personal Finance Minute.  Bankers are already complaining, claiming the study is premature and coming too closely on the heels of regulatory changes which took effect in July 2006.  Consumer advocates contend that more needs to be done to protect consumers from unspoken and exorbitant fees.  Two of the five programs to be studied have drawn the ire of industry watchdogs. 
[00:28:30]  Both enroll customers into the overdraft protection program automatically.  One is promoted, and the other is non-promoted, leaving customers in the dark with no warning of the fees to be incurred if they overdraw their account.  Consumer advocates say that these particular programs turn ATM and debit cards into the most expensive cards on the market.  For more on this and other personal finance issues, visit Bankrate.com.  I'm Shana Steiner.  And now, a minute with the New York Times. 
[00:29:00]  Here's food and wine critic Eric Asimov.  Everyday bottles are the bedrock of wine drinking.  Sure, we can go on and on about the great Bordeaux, Burgundy, or Barolo we had at some celebration.  But unless you just hit the lottery, people don't drink wines like those most nights.  Instead, in the Lange region of Italy at least, they drink wines like Dolcetto, a juicy wine that refreshes and stimulates the appetite.  Typically, Dolcetto has bright cherry flavors that contrast with a bitter chocolate edge.  It's a delight, but not demanding, light-verse rather than an epic. 
[00:29:30]  It's also a versatile wine that can bridge a gap between delicate fish and more robust meat dishes.  While Dolcetto is produced all over the Lange, its twin centers are the towns of Alba and Doliani.  It's easier to find Dolcetto d'Alba, but Dolcetto di Doliani is often thought to have the edge in quality.  Look for producers like Conterno Fontino, Pecanino, Ainaudi, Sandrone, and Masolino.  This is Eric Asimov of the New York Times.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:30:00]  I've been betting a Negro.  Well, that's what you don't see right now.  This shit's pretty good.  And now, the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, Stalker Patty's in the studio.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  She's on a dating service online now.  I'm on TrueDuckJump.  And Patty, we found the part where it says, I consider my looks, and then it's multiple choice there.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten choices. 
[00:30:30]  Well, I'm not going to say I'm ugly.  Yes, there's no choice for ugly.  We're not saying that.  You said you were attractive.  Yeah, I think I am for my age.  Suck.  Do you know attractive is the sixth one out of ten?  Yeah.  Six up, you picked.  Can I be completely honest with you?  You should have checked a little below average.  Why?  No.  I'm being fair.  But I can't help it if I'm my age. 
[00:31:00]  Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.  If you, I would have actually said on the plain side.  I would have said, I would have, here's the way it goes.  Stunningly attractive, you knew not to touch that one.  Well, extremely attractive, you knew, was in no way.  Very attractive, not even in the ballpark.  Yet you thought that you were right under very attractive, which is attractive.  Yeah, meaning I cannot.  Shut your mouth.  Right under that was a little above average.  You think you're more attractive.  Patty, there are girls that are 300 pounds listening to us right now that are so much more attractive than you. 
[00:31:30]  So much more.  You think you're closer to attractive than a little above average.  Well, I don't know, I'm not going to say bad things about myself.  You don't think you're average?  I want to put myself as positive as possible.  But this is the problem with these dating sites.  Everyone lies.  You don't think you're average, Patty?  You're not attractive.  If I lied, I would have said extremely or something.  No, you're not attractive.  You didn't think that you're below, a little above average.  All right, so I should have checked ugly.  I am ugly.  No, no, no, no, wait a minute.  Well, you are, but there's a little above average. 
[00:32:00]  There's average.  You could have at least done average.  All right.  Average looks.  There's a little below average, which you probably should have hit.  You know what attractive is?  You walk down the street, occasionally, guys are going to look at you and go, hey.  Ooh.  Hey, she's attractive.  Very attractive.  A lot of guys are going to look at you.  Extremely and stunning.  You can't move without guys looking all at you.  Those are the girls you follow for two or three blocks, even though you didn't need to go that far.  A little above average is a girl walks around, and every so often somebody with a fetish or something looks and goes, all right, that's it. 
[00:32:30]  Average, no guy looks at.  That's you.  As you walk down the street, no guy looks at you and goes.  You're giving her average?  No, she's not average.  No, that's what I'm saying average is.  Like, you could at least – that is your, like, highest point would be to go to average.  Anything above that is completely lying.  There's also a little below average, which you could fall into, and then there's on the plain side.  Oh, I'm not going to say I'm below average. 
[00:33:00]  You are, though.  Well, you are.  How about on the plain side?  I think you are.  You're rather plain.  You're very plain.  I'm not dirty or anything.  No one said you're dirty, but you're plain.  But see, if you're not honest, you know, then some guy's going to come along and go, oh, my God, she was lying.  You have glasses.  Yeah, you want to meet someone that likes it for you.  You have glasses.  You have almost a Tiberius Caesar front of the hairdo.  You have thin lips.  You have hammertoes and bunions, I would say, on the plain side.  And a eating improvement.  Kind of a greasy look going on. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, kind of a greasy look.  And you have slumped breasts.  And probably haven't had your teeth cleaned in a while.  This should have been on lies.com.  I went to my dentist six months ago.  You had to just scream and cry.  I had no bone loss.  I had no cavities, nothing.  You should have been on false.com.  Yeah, you have a bit of a belly now.  Your butt's getting big.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, a little wide.  You're getting the secretary spread, they call it.  But I'm actually eating laughs.  Looks like you're wearing state trooper motorcycle pants all the time.  You have face veins. 
[00:34:00]  And your ears are a little big at this point.  Yeah, they're getting bigger.  Yeah.  That's okay.  There's almost a simian thing going on.  But it's not like you shouldn't have checked the track.  My ears are big.  You'd look cute in a conductor's hat or playing an organ while a man.  Yeah, and like coveralls.  Yeah.  You should be jumping up and down on a news reporter's desk while they try to calm you.  Yeah, I would cover the ears.  Do you have a steel cup that people would throw a change in as some Italian grinds away?  No, I'm not homeless. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, take the hair down.  Cover up those ugly ears.  There you go.  There you go.  Now that just stepped you up to...  There you go.  You took care of one out of 20 problems.  Now you should see needing improvement.  You should have checked needing improvement but not checked that you should have put it...  I think I should have that book, The Fat Smash Diet.  She just doesn't care about your punchlines.  That's okay.  She didn't have her headphones on.  You're in the middle of a line and it just got trampled on.  That's all right.  Go ahead.  You talk.  I'm sorry.  I'll just shut up.  Yeah, because you're...  Oh, I missed this one. 
[00:35:00]  Right under needing improvement.  Yee!  Ooh!  I know I'm not that.  She should put needing improvement and have an arrow pointed down.  A Chevy needs improvement.  All right, Patty.  You need a cock.  It's time to shove that thing up your pussy.  One old virgin as is.  All right.  How are we going to do this?  Take your pants off.  Patty, yeah, I think you got to sit back a little or sit in that chair maybe.  Yeah.  Put your legs up in the air.  So the camera got a little... 
[00:35:30]  There you go.  Now, yeah.  Rip down your pants.  Patty looks good without pants.  Whenever I got to say that.  Patty looks good.  You have a good body.  I mean, you look...  You have a nice butt.  Jimmy likes your ass and your...  I think you're pretty sexy.  Actually, I have to tease you, but you are.  He likes your ass and your pants.  What kind of panties you got on today?  Yeah, what do your panties look like today?  Dirty core.  They're just gray.  Where do you shop for fucking panties and champs?  No.  Come on, Patty. 
[00:36:00]  Sex it up a little.  I don't remember where my underwear comes from.  I just got some...  Patty's...  What do you shave down there?  Oh, my God.  It's not bad.  Do you shave down there?  Not bad.  Let me see.  It looks good.  Turn this way.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy likes her ass and...  She shaves everything but the lips.  That's good.  That's smart.  Oh, my God.  Do you shave all around?  Oh, my God.  Well, I didn't do it in a week.  Oh, you haven't shaved in a week.  All right.  Let me see.  Patty, turn it towards me.  I'm not going to touch you.  Let me see.  I didn't feel like...  Patty has a nice pussy.  Patty has...  It's not a nice pussy, Jimmy. 
[00:36:30]  Jimmy likes the Patty pussy.  Turn this way.  It's not.  Yes, it is.  And a pussy.  She's 51 years old.  That's a fat little nice one.  Patty has a nice one.  I like the yellow stain in the underwear, too.  Patty has...  Yellow stain.  No, bitch.  She pulled her pants down.  I started dry heaving.  Because it's Patty and you think that you're not supposed to look at her vag.  Don't pull her back up.  No, no.  Don't.  She's fine, man.  I mean, it's great.  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  I'm with you the whole way.  I'm with you the whole way.  She looks good.  Yeah.  Be nice.  I think you have a nice...  Patty, just rip them down on your knees and sit down. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, rip them down.  And sit down.  There you go.  You look good, Patty.  Now, what you got to do.  Here's what you got to do.  Roll forward and grab your friend over there.  And you have to...  Do you want a glove on?  Do you want a con...  Maybe.  No condom.  No.  Just a glove, Jimmy, of course.  Just a glove on your hand because the lubricant might get on you.  It's not a real one.  No.  Now, take the KY.  What is this supposed to be?  That is lubricant.  And you got to pull your pants down a little farther.  Patty, so we can see.  She has fucking nice legs.  Yeah, try to make this sort of sex. 
[00:37:30]  Patty, please.  Can someone help her open the KY?  I'll open it, yeah.  Jimmy can do it with one hand like Fonzie.  Yeah, I snap my fingers and it pops open.  Hockadoosh.  Hey, you loop this up and get the body, Maraquista.  What?  It's like sauce.  Hey, you put it on your bucket holes.  Can I at least get an inno out of this?  What's going on?  Yeah.  You're going to get an inno.  Now, spread it around all over that.  Like that?  Get it all good.  What is this stuff supposed to be like? 
[00:38:00]  Microphone.  What is this KY?  Yeah, how about a microphone on that?  What is it made of?  It's made of a synthetic gel that is lubricant.  It's a fucking whale blubber.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  It's slippery.  It's supposed to be.  Now, Patty, here comes the tough part for you.  Anyway, take another bit of KY.  Put it on your finger, on your gloved finger.  I have enough for my time.  No, believe me.  More.  Now, smear it around your opening.  Now, rub that snatch. 
[00:38:30]  Just smear it around the opening in a circular motion and go, as you're doing it, go further in.  A little bit further in.  Just do it.  All right, I did it.  A little bit more to make it easier.  Make it easy.  Go in a little bit.  Get the entrance way a little slippery.  Like that?  Want me to do it?  No.  Like when the foyer's wet at the house.  That's okay.  You open the door and slip.  Patty, you want me to do it?  Yeah, Jimmy's going to do it and make sure it's clean.  No.  How about this?  Just the outside. 
[00:39:00]  I won't put my fingers.  I'm not going to violate you.  I'll wash my hands first and make sure they're clean.  I'll put it on the outside to make sure that you're lubricated.  I know how to do that.  But I'll go wash my hands and make sure they're clean.  I'll be nice.  I'm not going to attack you.  Didn't I do it right?  No, you don't have enough on there.  I'll wash my hands and come back so at least you know my hands are clean.  All right, I'll be nice.  I've touched you before.  I'm not going to grab you.  All right, Jimmy is going to wash.  Why are you so nervous, Patty?  Yeah, are you turned on and excited?  She's nervous.  You sound a little excited. 
[00:39:30]  No, I'm just nervous.  Yeah?  You're shaking more than the vibe right here.  You are shaking.  Hey, Patty, also, if you take your finger and you go up a little bit, up from the entrance.  Yeah, right there.  Yeah, yeah.  And kind of rub around there.  There's nothing over there.  No, there's something there.  Just rub around there until Jimmy gets back.  Yeah.  Just rub a little bit.  Rub a little bit.  Just rub.  What am I supposed to happen?  Nothing's going to happen.  Your head's going to explode if there's any fucking justice in this world.  I've never done this before.  Yeah, confetti can fly out of your ears.  Just, yeah, just rub it around until you feel a spot that feels kind of fun and wait 
[00:40:00]  for Jimmy to get back.  How about?  Just keep going.  What are you stopping for?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  That felt kind of good, right?  See, you silly goose.  Now, now.  Hold on.  You never did that before?  No, she goes through her underwear.  Patty.  She just shook her head.  Patty.  Just continue.  She just got a feeling for the first time in her life.  You never felt that feeling before?  That's where you got to rub your blithering.  Look.  Do it again.  Just do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again. 
[00:40:30]  Do it again.  Show Jimmy.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Oh, yeah, by the clip.  See, right there.  Now, go ahead.  Do it.  That's very sexy.  Now, why are you wincing like it's painful?  She has a nice body.  Patty, you have a nice body.  You're wincing.  You just say that.  No, I'm not.  You have a nice body.  Patty, that is something good and nice that you're supposed to do for yourself.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Don't be so sadistic.  No, he's not.  Do it again.  Because it's something nice that you should know how to do.  Do it again.  Show Jimmy.  Do it again.  And don't stop. 
[00:41:00]  What?  No matter what it feels like, don't stop.  Keep going.  Why are you wincing?  You look like you're in pain.  Because you're feeling guilty because you like it.  Right.  Stop feeling guilty.  You like that.  And you're feeling guilty, so you wince.  She found her clip for the first time.  She finally found it at a 51 fucking years old.  We're teaching a 51-year-old how to jerk off.  Can I put some of this on you?  I'll be nice.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  I won't be gross. 
[00:41:30]  He's not allowed to.  Jimmy will help you.  No, I've touched Patty before.  I'm not going to be able to attack you.  Yeah, Jimmy will help you.  I'm not going to violate you.  All right.  Jimmy will help you out.  Okay.  Just relax, Patty.  It's no big deal.  Don't, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Just relax there.  Okay.  Right there.  Mm-hmm.  Well.  What do you think?  Pretty much. 
[00:42:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Jimmy's almost done.  He's like half done.  Oh, really?  What do you think?  I'm waiting.  What, Patty?  What's going on over there?  It's very nice.  It might be a mean, right?  Don't you have enough one?  This is good, right?  See?  That's like a good thing.  What's going on, Patty?  I know when Jimmy does that to me, it feels good for me. 
[00:42:30]  He doesn't do that to you.  Oh.  Okay.  I think that's enough.  All right.  He uses his mouth.  I think that's enough.  Okay.  You like it.  You're all...  No, she likes it too much is what it is.  It felt kind of good, right?  It felt weird.  Did it feel good?  Come on.  Be honest with the weird and this and that and the laughing and stuff.  Did it feel good?  I touched you nicely.  It didn't feel bad.  All right.  I touched you nicely.  Fair enough, sir.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  Is the thing still lubed up?  All right.  Now, Patty.  Yeah.  Very slow.  You want some vibration or you want to go in?  No, no vibrating immediately.  Wait till it's in.  Go slow.  No one.  Hammer it.  Now, very slowly, at your own pace, take the tip of that.  You know where it goes.  You said you've used tampons before.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Right where the tampons are?  Now, yeah.  Now, keep going.  Yeah, buddy.  See, now, what's the difference between this and a gynecologist?  Just go slow.  It's all in your head.  Let go. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, but he used metal things.  Yeah, that scared you.  Go on.  We got metal things later on here.  No, that's okay.  You got a fucking ratchet.  I promise I'll go to the gynecologist.  Okay, just go slow.  Now, how far?  Are we getting anything, Danny?  Yeah.  Yeah?  All right.  Are you getting anything?  Go slow.  Go.  Yeah.  What happened?  It's slipping past some of those muscles.  It's just a little farther than I've.  But with the tampon.  Like a tampon.  The tampon's going farther than that.  Oh, yeah.  It's gone where no man has gone before.  Put it in a little bit.  It's in the same place that the tampon goes. 
[00:44:00]  Now, mark it off with your finger on the top.  Why is it up to your.  Patty, mark your finger.  Right here?  No, no.  Put your finger on the thing where it is.  It didn't go in that far.  That's how far you were in?  No.  No.  You marked it wrong.  Look at it.  She's gasping.  You marked it a little bit too much.  Yeah, you marked it wrong.  Try it again.  Try it again.  Try it again.  You should be lubed up now more where it's supposed to be.  It's very small.  It's not going to hurt you.  It's like.  It's weird.  Now, Patty.  Patty, go in and out with it.  Like this?  Yeah.  That's how you're supposed to do it.  Now, keep going.  In.  Out. 
[00:44:30]  It's gone.  It's gone in further than a tampon.  See?  No, it's not.  It's not much.  It's smaller.  Well, now, you could go.  You could take that whole fucking thing.  Don't you tell me.  Just go slow.  Go slow.  Now, Patty, see the black thing on the back?  Give it a little turn.  Yeah.  No.  Hold this?  Yeah, hold it now.  Jimmy, turn it on for her.  Let her do it.  She'll feel safer.  I don't know how to.  No?  Give it a turn.  I can't. 
[00:45:00]  Is she doing her wrong, Danny?  Yeah, it's the tip.  Not the whole thing.  Just the very end of it.  Oh, shoot.  Oh, my God.  See, give it now.  No, that jolted me.  Yeah, give it a little.  Don't worry about it.  It's not going to hurt you.  If you turn a little bit, it's only going to go a little bit.  See?  You control it.  Now, shove it up deeper.  Away.  No.  I can't go any further.  Now, turn it.  Now, hit her over the head with the mic stand.  No, it's okay.  You're doing good.  Yeah, keep doing it, Patty.  See?  Go ahead. 
[00:45:30]  Do more.  A little more.  It's like giving you.  Get her face too, Hulk.  Yeah.  See?  Isn't that good?  It was weird.  This is like giving yourself morphine.  She's like, yeah.  She's in control of our morphine drift.  She's in control.  Oh, I need a little more.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  What do you think?  Come on, Patty.  We're not doing you.  I want to see what Rob caught.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, you guys.  Good morning.  You guys missed Opie's best line of the day.  A way for confetti to come shooting out of her ears. 
[00:46:00]  Come on, boys.  I didn't hear that.  Thank you, son.  Shooting out of her ears.  Now, Patty, what does it feel like?  It just felt like very vibrating up there.  But is it?  I know.  I'm not talking about the actual feeling.  Yeah, it's just weird.  Patty, slide it up again.  Is it good?  It just felt different.  All right.  Put it again.  Tell us while it's in there.  We should have asked you while it's in there.  I will make a deal with you.  If you can get it all the way up to the block, I'll give you a new no.  I can't do it that far because it would hurt me.  All right.  Don't get it.  Well, how far can you go? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  This is about as far as I can take it.  A little bit more.  It won't go anywhere.  No, you can go further.  I can't.  You're built for that.  Women are built for the bigger than that.  I can't.  It hurts.  No, come on.  Not your mind.  It's on your head.  It hurts.  Now turn it a little bit.  It's OJ.  Turn it.  It hurts.  Some vibrating up that twine.  Turn it.  Now go in and out with it.  I can't go anywhere.  Go in.  Now go out and then in and out and in then.  Yeah.  What, like this?  Yeah, now push it in.  Now make it like it's sex. 
[00:47:00]  That's how you're supposed to do it.  Make sex.  Make sex with it.  I've never had it.  Let's just pretend.  Make sex.  Oh, please don't be mean.  Now be nice to the whore.  All right, I'm sorry.  See, that's how you're supposed to do it.  Now you're having, like, sex with yourself.  Dirty whore.  Now take your finger with the glove and touch where you were touching before.  Yeah.  Yes.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  No, while you're doing the vibrator, you nut.  You don't shut it off.  Wait, what?  What, here?  Do you want to?  No, no, look. 
[00:47:30]  Here?  Yeah.  Now do, now in and out.  Now do, I know it takes two hands.  Now move your finger around.  This could turn out to be the greatest video ever, by the way.  Oh, I don't hope it doesn't go on the website.  No, it won't ever end up on the website, don't it?  See?  See that.  Now just keep fooling like that.  See?  See?  Keep going.  Keep going.  No.  Keep going.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  I bet she's a squirter.  Don't stop.  Keep going.  No. 
[00:48:00]  Keep going.  Keep going.  Don't stop.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Don't stop.  Keep that finger moving.  Yeah.  And keep the thing going in and out.  That's good.  Yeah.  Keep it going.  Don't look at me.  Don't stop.  Don't look at me.  Don't stop.  Keep going.  Look at Jimmy.  Keep going, Patty.  It's good.  Yeah.  Move it around.  Someone wants to know if this is the missing trainables audio.  Keep going. 
[00:48:30]  Don't stop.  Keep going.  Yeah.  May as well be trainables.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Patty.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You're doing good.  You're doing good.  Trust me.  See?  Trust me.  You'll thank us later.  Keep going.  Don't stop.  And stick to all the places that feel the best.  Yeah.  I bet.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Oh, my God.  You're making some...  Well...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, see?  Keep going. 
[00:49:00]  51.  Jesus Christ.  Keep doing that.  I feel like what I did at the fucking elementary school last week.  Keep going.  At least, you know, at least they didn't know.  Keep going.  Give me Tarka through it.  She's doing great.  You're doing perfect.  Keep going, baby.  Keep going.  Now, more in and out with the thing.  Yeah, push it in and out a little bit.  It takes a little coordination.  And then with the finger, you just keep going on the good spots there.  And keep going.  Keep rubbing the finger.  Don't be shy about it.  It's your body.  Go ahead.  Whatever pressure you need.  Now, keep going.  Push it in and out, Patty. 
[00:49:30]  A little bit in and out.  Push it in.  Don't be a fucking whore.  I'm not.  No, I didn't say that.  Yes, you did.  Now, keep going.  You're not.  You really are not.  I thought I was doing my ventriloquist.  You would be.  I'm enjoying ventriloquism.  I was on to enjoy it.  It feels good, right?  It just feels weird.  I'm filling up a little bit.  Oh, Jesus.  It feels weird?  Yeah.  Weird, like different.  But you're like twitching it and making sounds when you're talking like you're enjoying it.  Yeah, let's go. 
[00:50:00]  Move it.  Keep moving it in.  Go in more.  I don't think I could get it anymore.  That's okay.  Yeah, just a little bit.  Keep moving your finger, Patty.  I think secretly Patty's a cock hog.  Spread him a little.  Keep moving your finger.  Spread your knees apart a little more.  Yeah.  Jesus.  There you go.  Now, keep going.  You've got to have some coordination, yeah.  Play the guitar.  Diddle.  Let's go.  Diddle with that finger.  Move that hand around like Michael J. Fox's hand.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:30]  What?  What, Patty?  No, I just got another look at it.  That's what guys say.  It's in halfway.  Yeah.  See, it doesn't hurt.  It's good.  Yeah, keep going, Patty.  You're working it.  You're preparing yourself for a man.  That's right.  Here's Jim.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, is it me or does it sound like her protests are turning into whimpers?  Yeah, they're slowly fading.  Patty's protests are slowly fading.  Damn, Patty has a nice fat one.  See, Patty?  You like that?  You want to turn up the vibrator a little bit, get a little more action going? 
[00:51:00]  You could probably handle it.  Turn it up.  You could probably handle a little more vibration.  Yeah, just see what happens.  Then what's there?  Yeah, just turn a little more.  There you go.  There you go.  Holy shoot.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Can I slow it down?  No, keep going.  Can I slow it down, please?  No, no.  Keep going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  It's okay.  Why can't I slow it down?  You'll keep it going.  Keep it going.  This is something you need to do.  It's too fast.  This is better than any therapy session.  Yeah, you're going to love this. 
[00:51:30]  It's okay, Patty.  You're going to love this, and you're going to get over a lot of guilt and dumb feelings,  finally, once and for all.  Let's go.  Patty, you know what else you do?  So, pull it out, and now put the vibrator where your finger was.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  What?  Yes.  Trust us.  Trust us.  Try it.  Trust us on this one.  Pull it out.  Right there?  Yeah, put it where your finger is.  Put it where the gloved finger is.  And put it, yeah.  Trust us.  And rub it around on there.  Yeah, trust us.  Use that like you were using your finger.  Oh, my. 
[00:52:00]  Just go with it, Patty.  Just go with it.  Go with it.  Yeah, it's good.  That's what you should do.  Go with it.  No, wait.  I've got to stop.  No, no.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  It's okay.  Don't worry.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  You're serious, Patty.  It's okay.  I think I did it enough.  No, don't stop.  No, you'll know when you did it enough.  Yeah, don't stop.  No.  Don't stop.  You'll know.  Don't stop.  Just don't stop. 
[00:52:30]  It's okay.  It's good.  Keep going.  Wait.  No, keep going.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  Free your mind.  Close your eyes and don't stop.  Yeah, just don't even think about anything but how it feels.  I wish I could stop.  No laughing.  Keep going.  It's good. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my.  I've got to stop.  I've got to stop.  No, no.  No, stop.  I can't finish.  Don't stop.  You can't.  I can't.  Why you.  I.  I got.  I got.  I got.  I got.  I got to stop.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going. 
[00:53:30]  Keep going.  It's good.  Keep going.  What are you doing to me?  Keep going.  You're doing good.  Keep going.  You keep going.  Don't stop.  Jimmy, how's she doing?  She's really doing good.  Yeah, she is.  It's sexy.  Come on.  Just enjoy it.  Keep it.  Just use the same spot you had with the finger.  Yeah.  It's supposed to feel good.  Right there.  Come on.  Okay.  You know where the good spot is.  Go ahead, Patty.  Keep it there.  She's climbing up the chair.  Yeah.  Patty, hit it.  Well. 
[00:54:00]  The greatest face ever, by the way.  The Pell Talkers are enjoying it.  Don't you worry.  Just your face.  It should be interesting when I go on it tonight.  Don't worry about that.  Give me a thing and applaud you.  They love you.  Keep doing it.  Keep doing it.  You're a hero for the show and for all your friends.  Keep going.  Same spot.  Please.  It's getting worse.  I know.  Worse.  Better.  Whatever you want to call it.  People are saying this is the greatest thing ever heard on radio.  So, you can't let us down. 
[00:54:30]  You can't let us down.  It's there.  Come on.  Almost there.  Go ahead, baby.  You're doing it.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Now, Patty.  See what you're doing?  Can you hold the vibrator with one hand on that spot?  You know the spot.  Take the gloved hand now.  Now, take one finger from the gloved hand and put it in you.  This one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Inside a little bit.  No.  Inside.  Other way.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  You're so close.  Now, do that.  Now, put the vibrator where.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, do that. 
[00:55:00]  There you go.  Easier time talking in a fucking passenger flying a 747 because the crew died.  May as well be.  I know it's a little long way around, but you get the message.  Go ahead, Patty.  Go ahead.  I'm trying to.  That's a stink.  Patty, get into that place again where you were really feeling good.  She is.  Just keep doing it, Patty.  All right.  There you go.  I wonder what my face looks like right now.  You look like you're enjoying yourself.  Yeah, it looks fine.  The face looks horrific. 
[00:55:30]  It looks fine.  Terrific.  Yeah, like.  It looks terrific, right.  Let her concentrate.  Let her concentrate.  Looks like she's getting murdered.  That's a little strange, but we'll go with it.  Go ahead, Patty.  People saying best show ever, Patty.  You can't let us down.  Just concentrate on that spot that you like.  Her nipples are hard.  Oh, my God.  What do you think?  That's sexy.  I'm not going to stop.  No, no.  Come on.  Don't stop.  There's no stopping.  Don't stop.  Keep doing it.  Stop being nervous.  Just close your eyes and think of it. 
[00:56:00]  No one's going to bother you.  Shh.  Close your eyes.  Think of whatever you want to think of.  I can only imagine the comments.  No bad ones.  No bad ones.  Don't.  See, now your mind isn't on it anymore.  Yeah.  They're great.  The comments are actually great.  Your mind isn't where it's supposed to be.  People are happy for you.  Move it around on the good spot there. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Stop avoiding the good spot.  Yeah, you're avoiding the good spot.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Oh, the batteries are dark.  Jesus.  No, they're okay.  It's a tough mission for this device.  No kidding.  What's going on, Patty?  Don't stop.  Let Jimmy pinch your nipples. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, no.  That's painful.  No, not pinch them.  We're going to pinch them.  Purple nurple like the third grade.  It's like one of those things that you just don't like to be touched.  Let Jimmy stimulate your upper half.  I'll try it for a second if you don't like it on top.  He'll just lightly brush over with his fingertips.  I'll be really gentle.  Yeah, don't pinch.  No, no.  I don't like that.  All right.  That's pain.  All right.  Jimmy's going to help.  Jimmy's a pro.  Yeah, Jimmy's going to help out.  And Jimmy's clean.  We promise, Patty.  Please watch my hands.  Yeah.  We wouldn't mess with you with that stuff.  You want to lift your shirt up? 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to lift it up?  Come here.  I don't.  I'll be gentle.  You look good, Patty.  You look good.  Don't worry, buddy.  You look good.  I mean, just relax.  All right.  Okay.  Now, keep going on the good spots.  Don't stop doing that.  You're real gentle.  I don't get any sensation on my...  Well, keep going with the thingy there.  On the...  Yeah.  Oh, stop. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, God.  Real gentle.  Real gentle.  Oh, God.  I've got to stop.  No, keep going.  Don't stop.  Why?  No stopping.  I'm not used to this.  Yeah.  I know.  Keep going.  This is what we're getting you through.  It's healthy for you.  It's good for you.  This will free your mind.  Yep.  Oh, I'm free, okay?  This will free your mind.  I got you.  You look good.  Keep going.  Keep that thing where it belongs. 
[00:58:30]  There you go.  What does it feel like, Patty?  It feels like it's...  I've got to stop.  Oh, my God.  It feels weird.  I'm all vibrating.  You're all vibrating?  Yeah, tingly.  That's good.  I don't know how to describe it.  Work that area with that thing. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, you've got to move it around a little bit.  Work that area with that thing.  Just move it where it feels weird.  You've got to shuffle it around a little.  Just shuffle it around.  Well, push it back up wherever you like it.  Yeah, push it back up.  Yeah, wherever it was good for you.  Go for you.  Push it back up where you had it.  What do you think?  It feels weird.  Move it around a little bit.  Whatever feels right.  Someone's really making a call back and saying the only way this could end is with Bob Kelly hitting her on the head with a rock.  No.  Wow, that guy is listening. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Very early on.  What?  I've got to stop.  No, don't stop.  Don't stop and don't keep thinking that you've got to stop.  Yeah, this is where you don't stop, Patty.  That's distracting you.  This is where you don't stop.  Don't stop.  The mind plays a big part in this.  Don't stop.  The pal talker is, again, one of the greatest faces ever.  Don't stop.  This is where you don't stop.  Don't stop.  Go.  Go.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Oh, God.  Pal talk is going, Patty.  Patty.  It's long overdue. 
[01:00:00]  I hope that they are.  Come on.  Just keep going.  Don't think about anything else.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  51 years old, virgin, never had an orgasm, getting close.  Come on, Patty.  They're cheering, Patty.  Everybody.  I'm not even kidding.  No one's messing with you.  You know me.  I'd love to jump, you know, jump on and mess with you.  Put the knees apart a little more there, Patty. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Don't close up.  There you go.  What's going on?  It just feels vibrating, like really tingling.  It's stronger.  Yeah, come on.  When it gets stronger.  I can't say my word.  Keep going.  Yeah.  When it gets stronger, you work that area.  You don't back off.  Come on.  Does everybody do this?  Yes.  There's girls doing it along with you on pal talk.  Travis does it sometimes three, four times. 
[01:01:00]  That's right.  They're not shy.  They're doing it on pal talk right now.  They're all going, Patty, Patty.  Come on.  Right there.  Yes.  You're feeling it, right?  Just let yourself go.  Go right to that spot.  Let's make it feel good.  Open your mouth.  Go ahead.  Go ahead. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, my God.  You want Jimmy to hold the vibrator?  You can hold the vibrator.  He won't be touching you.  It's getting too much for me.  If your hand is getting tired, Jimmy can hold the vibrator.  It's getting too much for me.  What do you mean too much?  All right.  Yeah, but the sensation, it's a building thing.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be like a sneeze, Patty.  You know, it builds up, and then all of a sudden, I chew.  I chew.  Come on, Patty. 
[01:02:00]  You can leave your shoes off.  I forget.  Because I'm stiffening up so much.  So is Jimmy.  What do you mean by that?  He's sexy to watch.  You still got the right spot there, Patty? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, it's getting stronger.  Move it around.  It's just that it's more than I can handle.  You want Jimmy to do it?  He won't touch you.  He'll just touch, you know, the vibrator part.  Yeah, I'll do it.  If you want me to stop, I'll stop.  Yeah, let Jimmy touch the...  I think I'm doing fine.  Yeah, she is actually good at all.  She knows her body better than I do. 
[01:03:00]  Go ahead, Patty.  Just let go.  Let go of all that guilt, man.  Life's too short.  Are you getting close to something?  I think I got further than I've ever gone before to one step beyond.  Go ahead, Patty.  Way beyond.  People are saying she's holding back.  If you, like, feel good, moan. 
[01:03:30]  That's what instant feedback is saying.  And from girls on Pal Talk.  If it feels good, just let out a little moan, and that'll feel...  But I always thought that was phony or staged.  No, if it feels good, you know, and that way you'll, like, release your nerves.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  And I...  Oh, my God.  No.  Holly.  Oh, my God.  No. 
[01:04:30]  Do I still got to keep on doing it?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Stop.  I've got to stop.  I've got to stop.  Now it's getting stronger.  Come on.  Patty, everyone on PowTalk is saying go. 
[01:05:30]  Go, Patty, go.  Just do it.  You're so holding back.  You're getting right to the brink,  and then you're not allowing yourself to just go over the edge.  She's scared.  Don't be scared.  Don't say my name.  Don't fucking say my name.  Don't even be in that position and say my name.  Oh, God.  It comes in waves.  Yes, it does.  Is that what it does? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, it's normal.  Tsunami.  And then you're going to get one big one.  And then you're going to get one big one.  Oh, that's big.  Then this is a category four or five.  The way you rate things, that doesn't really mean much.  Wait.  Right there. 
[01:06:30]  There you go.  Wow.  I've got to stop.  Oh, my God.  No.  Why can't I stop?  Why can't I stop?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to...  Oh. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Can I stop?  Can I stop?  No.  Why?  I was asleep.  What is wrong? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my God.  You can't...  Holy shit.  I think she came.  No way.  I think she fucking came.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Oh, can I stop?  Please?  Yeah, you can... 
[01:08:00]  Is it very sensitive?  What?  Is it very sensitive right now?  Let me get my composure.  Let me get my composure.  Yeah, I think that last one kind of put her over the top.  Jimmy, did she?  It's hard.  Look at her.  She's still like...  She's all fucked up.  I don't know her body, but that last one was quite a jolt.  Yeah, that...  And then she seemed like she's coming down from a nice, uh...  I was watching the whole thing on Paltor, because it's easier to see, and you could definitely 
[01:08:30]  tell that something happened right there.  Yeah, she's feeling it right now.  I can't...  I can't catch my breath.  I'm still out of breath.  I can't even move.  Do you need your inhaler?  I don't...  I don't...  I don't think so.  They're all applauding and crowding.  I'm not having an asthma attack.  That's...  Shh.  They're applauding.  They're laughing.  Well, Patty, turn that off.  Patty, finally.  And boom goes the dynamite, yes.  Patty, finally, right? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I feel like my hand is like, uh...  You can have that.  Yeah, that's...  We're going to have to take home.  That's going to become your new best friend.  Yeah.  But now we're going to see Patty again.  Screwtrue.com.  There you go.  There's your boyfriend.  Let's all start chanting.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  You know what?  No, we can't do it with you. 
[01:09:30]  I give Patty a lot of credit today.  That was great.  Wow, Patty.  Excellent.  Do you think she had one?  Yeah, or it came really close.  I mean, again, it's going to be a bill.  She might have to be alone.  That's a lot of tension.  She has tissues.  Oh, wow.  She knows the jargon and everything.  Now all she's going to say is get out.  All right, let's go to the phones real fast.  Dave in Tennessee.  Dave.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I was going to call in to say it sounded like you found another piece of trainable audio,  but that ended up being kind of dementedly hot. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was interesting.  Mike on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  This is eight years in the making.  I want to say congratulations.  Yeah, see, they're congratulations, Patty.  Way to go, boys.  Good job.  All right.  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Well over 850 people in the room.  Pal Talk room.  Are they really?  Yeah.  Chris?  Thanks.  One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  Yep.  And I got a hard on.  All right, Scott. 
[01:10:30]  I filled up at one point, too.  That was kind of sexy, Patty.  Scott?  Nice.  Hey, man, I'll tell you what.  I had to pull my damn truck on the shoulder of the road, man.  You guys did a hell of a job, man.  I love listening to you.  Thank you, Scott.  What about the stuff I did?  Yeah, exactly.  We didn't do anything.  I'm the one that had to do it.  What about Howie in New York City?  Howie?  The Smithsonian called and said they want the vibrator.  Who?  The Smithsonian.  Smithsonian.  Ike has something to say.  Ike?  You. 
[01:11:00]  Yo.  I just want to say, Patty, make yourself feel better.  Just say no hetero.  No hetero.  Good job, Patty.  Good job.  Talon the trucker.  Talon.  Good morning, guys.  Congratulations, Patty.  Nice.  What would happen if she turned into a nymphomaniac and would call you guys every morning with  the gory details?  Yeah, everyone's just like fucking.  Yeah, but all she finally realized, all she wanted was uncut black dick.  And she became a size queen in two weeks.  A size queen? 
[01:11:30]  It was too small.  I like a lot more girth.  A cock hog.  Well, the other night I was doing a DP with a couple of guys I picked up at the bar.  Is Ron and Fez here?  This is going to be big news on the Ron and Fez show today.  You got to keep, you got to keep, give it a little, Patty, keep this too, in case you  need it.  Here.  Put the KY.  Yeah, take the KY.  We'll get, we'll get some more.  You don't need the gloves.  Yeah, you don't need the gloves.  Use your own hand, brother.  Use your own hand.  Mother of God.  What? 
[01:12:00]  This is going to get.  Throw it right there.  It's only lube.  Go ahead.  Throw your dirty, your dirty whore towel away.  Dirty whore towel.  Oh, shit.  Do I get a Nino?  Yeah.  You can explain that to God.  You can tell God why you just did that.  So it felt good though, right, Patty?  It just felt different.  I never felt anything like that before.  But the more you do it, the more it goes from feeling different to feeling really good 
[01:12:30]  and occupying all of your life.  Yeah.  That's why you're supposed to do it when you're younger.  You're supposed to start out because you've got plenty of free time on your hand.  You'll be in front of your computer before you know it.  And a lot of gooey stuff.  Blowing off friends and family.  I'm busy.  Not being able to work out because you just can't stop jerking off.  I've got things to do.  Allowing it to ruin your life.  You'll be there.  Being late for the cellar.  Jimmy?  Jim?  Thanks.  What?  You okay? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just telling Patty it's good that she's doing that.  All right, Patty.  That was wonderful.  Well, Patty.  Happy birthday.  See, we gave you the greatest birthday gift ever and you thought we didn't like you.  That's right.  And you go home and do that as much as humanly possible.  Next thing you know, you'll be spending all your money on it.  Questioning if we were a faggot or not.  No.  I think at the end of the month, I'll take myself on a little bus excursion to Atlantic City  and see the Borgata for the first time.  Why did you come there when I was working there?  I would have hooked you up. 
[01:13:30]  It'll do it.  Well, please throw yourself off the roof.  I can't go whenever I want.  Here's the honesty of the show coming in.  Seamus, yes.  Hey, I've been out for three weeks on the road, dude.  How in the hell am I going to explain to my wife that I just whacked my bag listening to Patty?  Oh, that was too hot.  Patty, guys were jerking off to you.  Holy shit.  Guys were jerking off listening to you.  Doug in Pittsburgh.  Doug.  Hey, Patty, that is tremendous, guys.  That is the best piece of radio I've ever heard. 
[01:14:00]  I'm in a steel mill, and I'm supposed to be in an outage meeting, and I'm sitting in a car listening to this.  The best piece of radio.  I wish I was where you were supposed to be instead of here, sir.  Let's go to Paul in Westchester.  Paul.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I just wanted to congratulate Patty and say that we finally have some respect for you out here.  Yeah.  There you go.  See?  You earned respect.  A nice lady wouldn't have done that, though.  Marlon from Brooklyn.  Marlon.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey. 
[01:14:30]  Yo, Jimmy had a real fucking creepy, soothing sound in his voice, like he was Gary Glitter trying to talk to a seven-year-old.  Well, you know what?  No, I know, dude, but it's like you want to...  I jerk off enough to know, like, it's hard to concentrate.  She's nervous.  She's just going, it's okay.  Just be mellow.  You want someone mellow.  You don't want excitement.  You know, it's hard with guys yelling, do it.  Play with it.  Stick it in.  I can imagine just sitting there and jacking off with everybody cheering on.  I certainly could.  I want Stugger Patty coming as my ringtone for text messages.  Oh, is that the new one?  For text messages. 
[01:15:00]  Oh.  Oh.  You do collect ringtones.  Good job.  Derek in Dallas.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Derek?  I just wanted to ask Jimmy there if that was one of those scheduled rapes from Friday's show.  Scheduled.  I just tweaked Patty's nipples a little.  It was nice, right?  I didn't do them rough.  Just check.  Someone had a really, really funny Photoshop on Wackbag.  That had to be the best show you guys have done in a long time.  Thanks.  Thanks.  They had a lady in a business suit, and she's looking at her watch because she had a scheduled 
[01:15:30]  rape.  Did I say scheduled rape?  That's it?  Oh.  Or, yeah.  No, no.  I just don't remember the exact line.  I don't remember the exact line, but.  I don't remember the exact line.  I don't remember the exact line, but.  Or, yeah, something.  Or surprise.  I think it's something about a surprise rape.  Oh, yeah.  It was a surprise rape.  Oh, I do remember.  Whatever the line was.  I'm sorry.  Neil and Buffalo.  No, I don't remember either line.  Either way.  Neil.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You want to say hi to the dirty girl?  This is the best bonus time ever.  Oh, look at that.  Thank you.  All right, Neil.  Anybody else want to talk to Mary Magdalene? 
[01:16:00]  Amazes me.  After so many years, Patty, you can still somehow bring a surprise to the program.  She really is amazing.  Yeah, we're just about done with you.  I filled up a little bit.  I got a little bit.  Did you fill up?  Dude, not full.  Sam, do you have to fill my cock, you fucking homoerotic, raceless creep?  And he put away the company camcorder and brought out his own.  That's right.  It's not even on.  He just wants to get a better look at it.  I got to zoom in.  Do you?  Louie Anderson voice. 
[01:16:30]  Rub my cock on fucking E-Rock's dew.  That fucking awful rug you're wearing.  Stinks.  Rug.  You're Amon.  I don't mean to laugh, E-Rock.  I mean to laugh at you.  We got to get you.  Fucking Amon Gertwig.  Stinks.  I don't mean to laugh at you, but the front part of your hair does look like it's how  those commercials go.  It's like coming up.  It looks like it should be in front of Caesar's Palace with Evel Knievel jumping over it.  Hey, Ralph Fiennes, punch this website up for me. 
[01:17:00]  Fucking dew makes me sick.  You're killing my heart on E-Rock.  Look at that.  Go ahead.  Oh, God.  Go ahead and film that, you fruit.  Get off of that fucking dock.  My God, man.  Do you want to hold my rod?  Do you want to touch it?  I thought I did that once before.  Just touch it through the pants.  It's no big deal.  Go ahead.  Yeah, through the pants.  Why?  Go ahead.  Why?  Through the pants.  Right there. 
[01:17:30]  There you go.  The other side.  No, there.  She goes,  Ah, shit.  You want that, right?  See, that's usually what takes place of the dildo there, Pat.  See?  And there's no work for you.  You can just lay there and be unconscious.  We're trying to get out of here, but the phones are ridiculous.  Will in Denver.  Hey, Patty.  Yeah? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, Jesus was watching you, Patty, and now Jesus hates you, you heathen.  He starts laughing when he says, Jesus was watching you.  Hey, Will, can I get a snowcat there?  Hey, Robin in Jersey.  I just wanted to tell Patty that was hot.  She can wrap that up in a box because that was radio gold.  Yeah.  Look at that.  The lady's checking in.  Look at that.  That was hot.  All right.  The lady checking in.  The lady.  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Yeah, man.  It's only Monday, and you've already blown your wad. 
[01:18:30]  What are we going to do for the rest of the week?  Oh, we just coast now.  We figured it out.  Tomorrow we have a devil theme.  We have a bonus time, and you absolutely get to coast in my book.  Thank you.  Well, people will leak clear stuff.  I got a rod, says Tim in New York.  Hey, guys, what do you say tomorrow we all wear red horns?  Oh, for 666 day.  Yeah.  How about we don't?  How about we don't is right.  Okay.  We'll be the only devil.  Thank you, Patty.  By the way, that was all free. 
[01:19:00]  We did that for free.  Oh, right.  Bonus time.  That was bonus time.  Well, thank you, Patty.  That was great.  Good job.  Well done.  Little did you know that was going to be happening when you came in.  No, I didn't expect that.  That was always a surprise.  It certainly is.  All right.  All those years, you've been missing out on that.  Yeah.  Make sure you keep batteries in that little fella.  You want extra batteries? 
[01:19:30]  Extra batteries.  Give her a few extra batteries.  That's right.  Diggingly not included.  You know how bad, while she was doing that, I just wanted to put my hog by her face and  see what happens.  See if she just turns around and goes, walks around like a pro.  And then she, like, pulls me in by the balls.  Fingers my ass with one hand while she's fucking diddling her clit with the other.  Takes me balls deep into her throat.  With her fucking glasses mushed up against my appendix scar.  My fat gut in her face. 
[01:20:00]  It's like she's crooking me like the hello thing.  That's how she hooks my asshole and just pulls me in.  I've come hither luck.  I've come hither luck.  Holy crap.  Well, a lot of the girls were really into it.  Angela in Florida.  You can come hold my vibrator.  Angela.  So hot.  What's that?  I said he is so hot with her screaming and it made me miss my vibrator. 
[01:20:30]  I forgot to pack it.  I was like, oh, I just want Jimmy's voice going, it's okay.  See, people are digging Jimmy, actually.  No, the woman's voice in the background, even though she's got that fucked up accent.  It's a Staten Island accent.  No, that's a fucking alien accent.  Why, miss?  Miss, did you not like me whispering to Patty?  I had to.  Oh, no, I liked that.  I liked it.  I want you to whisper to me when I'm trying to come.  Well, yeah.  Whisper to me.  Come slowly, Angela. 
[01:21:00]  Come slowly.  Myspace slash Jim Norton.  See, whatever the girls like, I found extremely creepy.  Because it's to relax her.  Yeah, you can't ask her questions like they were asking her questions.  That's so hard.  You've got to really think about it.  And saying things like, there, there, jam it.  Jam it in your hole.  There, stop.  No, no.  Don't think of me.  Stop.  Get it.  I'm just trying to get the fucking mechanics of it down.  You took care of the psychological part of it.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  I was purely, you know, fucking tab A in slot B.  Do it right, stupid.  You like the old nips being rubbed, right?  That feels good.  That's what gets me off.  See, Patty didn't think that was contributing at all at first.  And then she started really getting...  Her nipples were hard.  I was licking my thumb and touching your nipple.  And that's why it was so smooth.  He is going to be such a fiend now.  Oh, yeah.  Y'all ruined it for any guy.  She's all about cock now.  Patty is all about cock.  What's that?  She's actually going to get a t-shirt that says cock or bust.  All right. 
[01:22:00]  Thank you, Angela.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Fuck.  All right.  We've done enough.  Yeah, we did it.  Ah, they're back.  Back with a vengeance.  And what an ass on her.  How's he going to eat?  How's he going to have almonds?  You want to fuck a chicken?  There's a chicken.  Stick it in.  That would be wonderful.  Holy shit.  Whoa, whoa.  Hey, calm down.  He is all about the ass.  The best of the worst of Opie and Anthony must pause for a break.  That made us sound like saggats.

[01:23:00]  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show, tip of the day on XM Radio.  Fuel cells are a form of an energy-efficient engine that has no moving parts, emits no exhaust,  and produces water clean enough to drink as exhaust.  Fuel cell engines work by passing electricity through an electrolyte and causing a chemical reaction.  Hydrogen gas is used to cause the chemical change inside the fuel cell.  Electricity is produced without combustion and is used to power the electric motor of the vehicle. 
[01:23:30]  The fuel cell has its own fuel supply, similar to a gas tank, but storing hydrogen gas.  The processor extracts hydrogen from the fuel and pumps it into the fuel cell, converting it directly into electrical energy.  That electrical energy is then used to power an electric motor, which drives the vehicle.  There, fuel cells made easy.  Got a question?  Check our website at americascarshow.com.

[01:27:00]  Derek has a buttery beat.  Hey, there we go.  I want to hear what a buttery beat is.  Let's hear it.  This buttery beat.  Oh, that's a buttery one, alright.  It's buttery with a little salt.  It's buttery, though.  No, it's buttery with jizz.  This is gay music.  Now, this is kind of buttery.  No, it's not bad. 
[01:27:30]  It's sort of buttery.  Buttery?  It's a buttery beat.  Two shirtless guys in leather vests should be dancing to this.  Right.  Well-muscled calves.  No matter what you do.  I was driving.  No matter what you do.  I was driving.  No matter what you do.  I was driving.  No matter what you do.  I was driving.  No matter what you do.  I was driving.  No matter what you do.  I was driving.  Are you adding to the butter?  Are you churning?  I was driving Lindsay crazy this weekend because in Central Park on the weekends, 
[01:28:00]  you get to enjoy some buttery beets, and we're walking through the park,  and I'm like, let's go check out some buttery beets.  They set up a little roller skating rink there.  Really?  Yeah, kind of like east of, what is it called?  Sheep Meadow.  East of Sheep Meadow, they set up a roller rink,  and there's some buttery beets happening and people doing their skating.  How about that?  And you sit on a hill, and you listen to some buttery beets,  and you watch people, like, dealing drugs and stuff. 
[01:28:30]  Is this report true?  I'm getting on instant feedback that the neighbor next to this building just put up a sign that says,  Caution retards reading.  All right.  Excuse me.  I want to break into this comedy because Derek has another buttery beets for all of us today.  Oh, let's hear it.  All right.  Come on.  Come on. 
[01:29:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  He's a fag! 
[01:29:30]  Oh!  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Nobody's got AIDS!  I'm a little disappointed.  Wow, this is really...  Buttery.  Not buttery stuff.  Nope.  This is buttery.  Not as buttery as the first one.  That was less buttery.  Stop it.  What defines buttery?  I don't want to explain it.  That put the butt in buttery.  That is some gay dancing, like, really... 
[01:30:00]  But see, you're confused.  Buttery doesn't mean gay.  What does it mean?  Smooth.  Smooth.  Buttery.  Yeah.  That was a little too harsh.  That was very harsh.  Yeah.  That was techno.  There was some glass in that buttery.  Ew, I hate a buttery beat.  Those words bother me.  I don't like a buttery beat.  Bothering buttery beatness.  Exactly.  Buttery beat alert.  We got another one coming.  No, we don't.  Yes, we do.  But first...  Who's deeming these buttery?  He's obviously...  I am!  You can't.  The last one wasn't as buttery as the first.  I'm sorry. 
[01:30:30]  I don't hold you as the buttery beat authority.  I want to know who came up with this.  I came up with the buttery beats for the show.  But who came up with the saying, and what is it based on?  Like, someone came up with New Wave.  I was playing Luminous, one of the greatest video games ever on...  And you said this sounds buttery?  ...on PSP.  And I just felt like...  I don't know.  It might be...  I think I heard it somewhere else.  Of course it's a saying somewhere.  Oh, all right.  We got the definition of buttery beat.  All right.  Good.  Now... 
[01:31:00]  Luminous is the greatest game in the world if you have OCD, by the way.  Yes.  What is it?  This is the description of Luminous on the back.  Oh.  What about a description of buttery beats?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay, here we go.  Yeah, I did get it from Luminous.  I'm sorry.  Bust blocks, groove through puzzles, and jam wirelessly with friends.  Stack them right, and you'll unlock lush looks and buttery beats.  Want to be Luminous?  Just let the music guide you. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, this is more buttery.  This is more buttery?  A little bit.  Holy shit.  You know what's buttery?  The substance that slides down your throat while you're enjoying this.  This is the music that they play like on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  No.  Yes, it is.  This is gay music.  This is luminous music.  I don't care. 
[01:32:00]  Whatever you want to call it.  How would you describe it?  I describe it.  I just...  That's too easy.  I describe it buttery.  This is...  This is too easy.  This is sweaty men having sex music.  Yeah.  This is like when one guy's kissing the other, he's holding the back of his head.  They're not even just kissing.  It's fucking...  He's got the back of his head, and the guy's doing a popper.  All the two bearded men fucking make out.  Like deep kissing.  Yeah.  Like we're not ashamed to be seen doing this.  Right.  Short hair dudes.  I say buttery. 
[01:32:30]  Short hair dudes.  I say buttery.  Do you say sugary?  What's sugary?  This is gay.  I don't know what word you want.  That's too easy.  Seamany.  Seamany.  People are suggesting buttery beets are anything you can tuck your junk between your legs and dance to.  No, Rob's got it.  Rob in Knoxville.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, that music is for taking ecstasy and having sex with chicks at clubs. 
[01:33:00]  Having sex with chicks at clubs.  Yeah, man.  You take some E and they just rub up against you.  No, it's not, sir.  That's why the beats are playing.  It's fucking...  Rob knows.  He doesn't.  It's two guys with short hair and like cropped like beards.  Right.  It's like kissing, holding each at the back of each other's heads like the way men will hold something close.  Like it's forceful man kissing.  Okay.  I have a buttery beat.  Go ahead.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  I bet you do.  Go ahead. 
[01:33:30]  That's not buttery.  That's a buttery beat, all right.  All right.  If you're not enjoying the buttery beats, if you're not enjoying the buttery beats, we're not.  We could go with some reggaeton.  Oh, that's the biggest.  I had to listen to Elo talk about how it's the biggest music ever on the face of the earth.  It is the number one format in radio right now.  Wonderful.  Reggaeton.  What is that?  It's like Latin music with like a good beat? 
[01:34:00]  It's Latin.  Boom, boom.  Yeah, it's Latin old school mixed with like rap, I think.  I think it's good if I've heard it right.  You have another buttery beat?  All right, here's another buttery beat.  Steve, just go over there and then walk back to the door to this music. 
[01:34:30]  Watch him.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  That is a buttery walk.  That's right.  We're a buttery bear.  Mark, he has buttery cheeks.  Let's go to Brian in North Carolina.  Brian.  A buttery beat to the official music of Mantown.  Mantown.  Buttery beats.  Music of Mantown, yeah.  All right.  A buttery beat as we go to break?  Oh, I'd rather we go to break.  This is the ultimate buttery beat right here. 
[01:35:00]  Welcome back to the Henson and Reed show.  Listen, listen in.  This is buttery.  From the game Luminous on the PSP.  Have you ever seen a grown man naked?  Have you ever been in a Turkish prison? 
[01:35:30]  Did you see that jerk?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Let's try now.  Asshole.  Asshole.  Asshole.  You like movies about gladiators.  Grr. 
[01:36:00]  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr. 
[01:36:30]  There you go.  You found the ultimate buttery beat right there, Derek.  So gay.  That ends the buttery beat bit.  And Derek goes, thank you.  Please.  Please.  It's the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What a brilliant idea.  The fucking porn in the news.  All I ever did when I was a kid is my friend Scott, he had a fucking cat box full of cat shit.  So I would get drunk and then take the daily paper and put all the cat shit in it and put it back on the table.  So when his father opened the paper, cat shit fell on him. 
[01:37:00]  He fell on him.  What a great gag.  What a scumbag you are.  Yeah.  He's now back in the hall after a hard day at work and opened it and six or seven little cat turds would fucking fall all over him.  What a douchebag.  What a douchebag.  I would get drunk.  We would always get drunk in his house and I would just urinate all over his faucets.  I was like big.  I remember being drunk in his bathroom.  I'm being drunk in his bathroom and I'm pissing all over the mirror and his fucking faucet handles and all over the floor. 
[01:37:30]  Why?  I don't know.  It just made me laugh to do so.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  Oh, is that funny?  We might have lost your mic, Jimmy.  We might have lost your mic, Jimmy.  Yeah.  We lost your mic when you were moving around.  Oh, wow.  I know what you did.  It's probably the connection.  There you go.  Just smack it a couple of times.  No.  Why would it work?  Perfect.  That's good?  Yeah.  It's making a hissing noise. 
[01:38:00]  No, that one's good now.  No, that one stinks.  It's broken.  Jesus.  Well, there's a whole thing up here.  How's that, Sam?  Is that on?  Am I on the radio?  Yes, you're on the radio.  Oh, I like this one better.  It makes me feel like an old time broadcaster.  You were a real fucked up drunk.  I was a naughty boy.  Wow.  Just going to start pissing on people's fucking faucets.  But I mean really pissing on it.  Not just the quick throw.  No.  Like, did you use the toilet at all during that session?  I wouldn't have noticed it if there was a...  There could have been a fucking flowers coming out of it for all I know. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  Why even open the fucking lid?  Certainly not.  Oh, God.  That is funny.  That is really funny.  And then me and Tom Naylor would fucking get dog shit, like big wet pieces of dog shit,  and put them in glad baggies, and then throw them down the library book return slot.  Some poor old lady just vaulted.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And we threw shit without baggies too, but I mean we had to carry it for a while.  She's just volunteering her stupid time. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  She has to deal with your shenanigans.  With people's books sliding down into their shit.  She's just trying to shush people.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  And their shitty books.  Oh, we were awful at shit.  Oh.  Alright.  Wow, that is really funny.  Cat shit in the newspaper rules, though.  I suggest it to anyone.  Because this cat shit stinks so bad, and you know there's going to be a couple of pellets  of fucking litter in it.  And then he just picks it up and it falls in his mouth.  Do you know how surreal that is when you come home after a long day's work, and you 
[01:39:30]  want to just read the paper, and the next thing you know there's animal shit in your lap?  You know how bad that cat must have got hit?  The cat did it.  Snuck over there, opened the paper, and shit, and closed it.  And closed the paper.  And then refolded it properly.  Oh, is that great.  Wow, are you a fucking degenerate.  I love it.  I was garbage.  Oh, God.  Nothing was better than that.  No.  No.  No.  Shit in people's mailboxes.  Who'd do that?  You were big on the shit thing. 
[01:40:00]  Funniest thing I've ever seen in my life, and I mean ever.  When I was six or seven, and my friend Mark Rosenberg, we were sitting there in the fucking  grass.  I love how he uses the real names.  It just makes the stories that much better.  Mark leaned back and he put his hand.  You've never seen a more fucking butterscotch pile of fucking wet dog shit.  It was as fresh as the fucking, I'm surprised the dog wasn't actually walking away when he  did it.  He put his hand, he leaned back for a casual chat in the grass and stuck his hand in this 
[01:40:30]  pile of shit.  And it's the funniest thing.  I've never seen anything funnier.  That was 32 years ago.  Oh, shit.  And nothing has come close.  Where you just doubled over crying laughing.  It was incomprehensibly funny.  Like, as a child, I didn't realize that anything could make you feel that kind of emotion.  And that's all it took.  And women think they understand what funny is.  Holy shit.  That's what funny is.  Hey, oh.  That is good. 
[01:41:00]  Andrea Pizer.  I guess she never called.  Do we have an update?  God damn.  Are we trying to get Andrea Pizer on the...  Dan?  Steve?  Can't get her on the phone from the New York Post?  Love that.  All right.  Hey, story of the days.  It's not for story of the day.  Remind me to tell you the stories of when we would drive by with cups and throw urine  on people in New Brunswick.  That was our favorite activity.  We would drive around, me and my friend Looch.  He was like 35 and he hung out with the teenagers.  Oh, creepy guy.  Yeah, he drove a fucking Volkswagen Bug and we would drink and I would piss into cups. 
[01:41:30]  And we would just drive through New Brunswick and throw it on people.  And I fucking...  I had...  I would leave the little...  Oh, we got some good ones.  And I fucking had a plastic cup with a plastic lid on it.  I'll never forget there was a couple walking.  And I fucking threw it and the arc was beautiful and the guy put his arm up to block it.  And it hit his arm and...  Exploded.  Piss went all over him and his girl.  Oh, would I be so fucking living. 
[01:42:00]  He had to be steamed.  We would drive around with eggs and egg people all the time.  I got a guy in New Brunswick.  He probably...  He probably remembers that.  Yeah.  That guy probably fucking remembers that shit.  That guy remembers being hit, putting his arm up.  And having...  In just slow motion having his cup hit him.  And he's probably, if he's listening, he's probably told himself for the last 25 years  it was beer.  No.  No, it wasn't.  I told you...  Yeah, I told you guys.  My friend fucking Stanley and Mike.  Wow.  Stanley was the bodybuilder.  We were 13 playing Asteroids and Mike was 13. 
[01:42:30]  And so Stanley...  Stanley wasn't gay.  He was just a fucking not as smart guy.  He was a martial artist.  Me, him and Mike would just drive around in his rickety old truck and they would show  up with margarine dishes full of motor oil.  And we would just go to people's open car windows and like throw the fucking motor oil  all over the inside of their car on their console.  Oh, you fucking scumbag.  And I remember one time Stan ate some Chinese food and Mike had the hot mustard.  And we saw some pretty girl.  And Mike went, hey whore, have some mustard. 
[01:43:00]  And he threw it at her and she waved.  And then she waved the mustard at her.  Hey whore.  Hey whore.  He was a sociopath.  Because I remember...  Oh shit.  You all were.  We were driving.  It was like 100 degrees out.  We saw this guy hitchhiking backwards with no shirt.  And fucking Mike goes, hey Stanley.  Let's fucking...  Let's drain some...  Let's drain the engine oil and drive back and throw some hot oil on him.  He wanted to drain oil out of the hot engine and throw it on a guy's bare chest while 
[01:43:30]  he was hitchhiking.  And he meant it.  Let's go throw hot oil on him, Stanley.  Fucking...  1353.  Dude, what's the hot oil?  Fucking...  We found one time the holy grail.  Jesus.  We were in a parking lot and we found a half a dish of melted chocolate ice cream.  And there was an open car window with one of those fur seat backs. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, we smooshed it all over the seat back.  We drove by five minutes later.  And there was an elderly couple.  They had to be in their 70s.  And they were outside the car and she's wiping chocolate off his back.  Oh, he must have been so hot under the collar.  He sat down and got fucking chocolate all over his old back.  Oh, it was perfect. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, that was a good one.  All over his old back.  Oh, he just...  He was...  I'll never forget him standing there and her behind him just wiping at his back.  Oh, are you a fuck?  Norton was a fucking minist.  Hey, Stanley, let's go back and throw hot oil on him.  Let's get a Paul in Nashville.  Paul.  Fucking minist.  He's a minist.  Paul.  Paul. 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  Go.  Let's go.  One of the best places to take a crap to piss someone off is to get up on the green at  a golf course.  Sit there and fill the hole full of shit.  Because you know that first golfer taps in, reaches in, grabs his ball and gets a handful  of shit.  That's a good one.  That's the answer.  That's a damn good one.  That's a damn good one.  Sorry.  I'll never forget the guy on the shoulder backwards hitchhiking with no shirt. 
[01:45:30]  You know what is also a good one with the old person and his wife wiping his back off?  How long did it take for him to sit there until he realized his back was in something?  It couldn't have been long because it was fur and we coated it with melted chocolate ice  cream.  You understand?  It was the holy grail of fun.  It was hot.  It was summer.  Wide open window.  His mistake.  I wish there wasn't a statute of limitations to fucking arrest this idiot.  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  That was a good one. 
[01:46:00]  What a creep.  Yeah.  That wasn't even the...  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  But you got a few.  Then we killed him.  Both of them.  They had the pickup truck one time and they had a couch, a giant old sofa on it.  So we set the sofa on fire and pushed it off the truck onto the highway.  We were hoping a car would hit it.  There's people in jail right now for six of the things he's talking about.  Right.  Did you ever think of consequences?  No.  We were 13, man. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, but I mean...  Stanley should have.  He was 25.  Holy shit.  Stanley, I don't know what Stanley was doing.  I know.  We had an old Volkswagen bug in the back of a pickup truck once and took it down the road  at about 60, 70 miles an hour and held onto the bed, the back of the bed and kicked this  thing out and just watched it like chasing the car as it was rolling.  And it was so good.  And we were going to do that and then just leave.  But nothing happened.  Like there weren't any cops.  There wasn't an explosion. 
[01:47:00]  People didn't come out or any way.  So we backed up, lifted it back into the truck so we could do it again.  It was so amazing looking to watch this thing just roll.  I remember one time me and my friend Marvin.  He was a Puerto Rican Jew.  Marvin Schnoll.  He was a good friend of mine.  We were hitchhiking, trick or treating.  And one guy, we knocked on his door and he didn't have it.  He said, I don't have no candy.  No.  Poor fuck.  So Marvin took his gum out and put it over the guy's peephole at his door.  So we're out in the yard. 
[01:47:30]  Five seconds later, the older man runs out and grabs Marvin and puts him in a headlock  and starts punching the top of his head.  And I just stood there in my Halloween costume and watched.  What were you dressed at?  I don't remember.  Darth Vader or something.  I just watched Marvin.  Real evil Darth Vader.  Yeah.  Just watching your friend get pummeled.  Yeah, while I held a fucking bag full of pennies and Milky Ways.  What was that fucking funny?  No, I remember when we were talking about, what was the thing you were talking about 
[01:48:00]  with the embarrassing stories?  Remember that shit?  What's the thing in school?  You ever remember something that's so embarrassing to this day when you think about it, you go,  oh.  I guess the deuce chill would be the way we describe it now.  We had a talk one night about those moments.  They're not embarrassing.  Like, yeah, I farted and this chick smelled.  Not exposure type embarrassing.  Things were like, wow, who I am is just garbage.  Yeah.  Like, humiliating little moments.  Ugh. 
[01:48:30]  And, uh, for me, one of them, it's not even that, it's awful.  Do you understand?  Like, one of them, and you just think back and go, oh.  Yeah.  I was in class.  I was in class.  And, uh, there was a whole class full of people.  It was dead silent.  And this guy walked by the outside of the classroom door.  And I was, I think a sophomore in freshman high school.  Freshman high school.  And there's seniors in the class.  It was a math class.  And the guy walked by the outside door.  And he was singing.  And the song he was singing had the beat of, da, da, da, da. 
[01:49:00]  It might have been a Christmas song.  But the guy was singing, bop, bop, bop, bop.  And I wanted to say, shut the fuck up.  Which would have probably gotten a big laugh.  Yeah.  But I bailed out and I went, shut up.  Silence.  Silence.  The class was silent.  Oh, you bombed. 
[01:49:30]  It did, it was, it was horrible how unfunny it was.  It was crawl out of your skin embarrassing.  Aw.  It was completely humiliating.  Yeah.  He had a much better one.  His was really awful.  I used to be the captain of the football team.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I used to be the hype man.  You know, like, y'all, how y'all feel?  And the team go, fire it up.  How y'all feel?  Fire it up. 
[01:50:00]  Break down.  Stick.  Break down.  Break down.  Break down.  Break down.  And we're going to get a treat.  Oh, boy.  I don't even want to look at him.  Did you do that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, boy.  I don't even want to look at him.  Did they just lose on purpose?  They said, what the fuck?  We won, but it was like, they just took away all my power with that.  It was so.  I would just let you get hit all the time, the whole game.  Were you embarrassed?  Oh, how embarrassing.  Oh, this was 18 years ago, and I just was, it was the worst.  Oh, is that embarrassing?  The best of the worst of Opie and Anthony must pause for a break.  Diddle until your privates turn raw.  Shut up, stupid.  The virus.

There's an ad right here with her picture riding the bus with my sister 
[01:55:30]  and it's just, it makes me angry how awful it is.  The ad itself is a Forrest Gump looking ripoff thing.  They have her sitting on a park bench, a bus bench, whatever it is,  like clouds in the background, the same type of Forrest Gump look.  I guess she's going for her Emmy.  Is that what this is?  No.  I was hoping for an Emmy.  Anybody that plays a retard on a TV movie is really gunning for that Emmy.  Yep.  Had her on Tony Danza yesterday.  One of the message boards popped up a website also.  She has a photo website.  You know how people have photo websites? 
[01:56:00]  You can post your pictures of your vacations or family get-togethers or whatever it is.  She has one of those.  And I went to it and it's just her like,  they have one of her girlfriend there and her laying in bed together.  Like a picture of a girlfriend's face looking all like they just woke up in the morning.  Picture Rosie's face on the pillow.  Hey man.  Rosie's a big fat mess, but she did well for herself.  Yeah, she didn't look that bad at all.  I mean, her chick.  I mean, if you're going to be a lesbian, I mean, she did all right, man. 
[01:56:30]  She did all right.  And then she's got her pictures of her kids on vacation.  It's like, she's just got this need, I guess, to open her life up to the public like that.  Like out of nowhere, all of a sudden she came out of the closet and now everything.  Look at these pictures.  They're just like anyone's pictures that would be online.  What kind of an idiot would put their pictures all over the...  And she writes all personal stuff in her blog.  Yeah, right?  What kind of idiot would do that?  Yeah, man.  Her...  See, look at the picture.  There's the two of them in bed. 
[01:57:00]  Where?  Where's the bed picture?  That was it.  That's the one?  The bed.  No, back up.  Back up, Eric.  Walk back.  Down.  Yeah, right there.  The two next to each other.  You see Rosie's on the pillow or something.  Oh, wow.  That's creepy, yeah.  She's kind of a porter.  Her girlfriend's a porter.  Wasn't she...  That's her other friend.  Her other friend?  That's not the one she's sleeping with.  That's the...  I hate to admit this, but I...  You know who that is?  Yeah, she used to work on the Rosie O'Donnell show.  What, faggot?  I know, I know.  I know. 
[01:57:30]  That's really bad.  Which is the one that she's a...  Which one is she?  That one right there.  Yeah.  The much thinner one.  Us in LA.  That's her.  Us.  She's a hot little blonde.  If you keep going, I think there's better pictures of her.  Yeah.  But she was on Tony Danza yesterday, plugging her show, her movie.  And I have been a fan over the years of made-for-TV retard movies.  I love them.  Can't get enough watching people try to act retarded.  And like Jimmy has said in the past, for some reason that's totally acceptable. 
[01:58:00]  It's fine.  People watch.  They do little goofy things.  There's always these comic moments where they're screwing something up in a retarded  way.  And the audience laughs along.  And that's fine.  Right.  But Jimmy gets on stage and does a retard joke.  And you know, you're the antichrist.  You suck.  You stink.  You should burn in hell.  Do a cute little reference about like, hey, there's a retarded person.  Let's pick up a stick and molest it.  It.  It.  It.  It.  It. 
[01:58:30]  So what?  The lacrosse team wants to do a little...  Have a little fun with her.  Yeah.  So what?  They throw milk money on her chest when they're finished.  There's no skill in acting retarded too.  None.  None whatsoever.  None.  We've all done it our whole, you know, our whole lives.  Why is it looked at like this big acting challenge that is so amazing when they do.  It's the easiest thing to do.  They all put on the stupid retard voice and walk around stupid.  Tom Hanks and Forrest Gump, he did a good job. 
[01:59:00]  Ben's been doing it for years.  You gotta give him credit.  But a lot of these other movies that come out, I'm just reminded of being in high school  with my friends and we all did the retard voice and stuff.  Right.  Don't be like a normal person.  There.  Give me a fucking Emmy.  If Rosie wants to win an Emmy, she should act thin.  That would be impressive.  Act thin and act like you love dick.  Who's the thin chick with the cock in her hand?  That's Rosie.  Give her an award.  It's amazing. 
[01:59:30]  So she's got this movie.  It's coming out Sunday.  Do we have the Corky CD?  We gotta get the Corky CD.  Corky.  Oh, Corky.  Singing Poison Ivy.  Now that guy should win an award.  Because that's a real retard acting in a TV series.  How they got him to do anything.  True.  Is amazing.  You see some of these guys, they're just banging their heads.  Ah!  Going crazy.  And they actually, you know, he followed direction.  Well, I bet you if you look behind the scenes, right off camera there's the director 
[02:00:00]  and his parents holding cow prods.  If he didn't say his lines right, he got a good shoulder and a fat thigh.  Gave him a teaching.  We've interviewed Corky over the years.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You, um, I remember I was at the studio at BAB once.  And it had a door with a little glass window in it.  A little glass window.  I'm so proud of you that you remember this one.  Oh, this one was a fine Opie moment.  Shining moment.  And, uh, this guy is peeking in the window. 
[02:00:30]  He looks in the window.  And obviously-  And he's just like, ah!  And he has down syndrome.  And, and Opie points at the window.  He goes, hey, look, Corky's at the window.  Joking.  Because we start laughing.  Yeah, because that's what, every time you see a retard, you go, hey, Corky.  It's Corky.  And, um, lo and behold, it was Corky.  He was there to do an interview.  I didn't know it at the time, though.  I really didn't.  But what are you supposed to do?  So, we invited him in and, uh, it was just awful radio for five or ten minutes.  You do have a similar look. 
[02:01:00]  You know.  Was he nice?  Actually, he was really cool.  I gotta, I gotta admit.  You didn't ask about the script or the, or the, or the plot lines.  Do you like cookies?  That's what it pretty much is.  Blow a pinwheel in front of his face for 15 minutes and then send him on his way.  Ooh.  He was doing a children's CD at the time.  Yeah.  Those creepy guys that were, you know, his handlers or whatever you want to call them.  Weren't they following him around?  A couple of musicians that, um, took him under, under their wing and, and had him singing songs. 
[02:01:30]  Oof.  That was another thing.  Two guys decided they were gonna hook up with Corky and, um, have him sing on their, uh, on their CD.  It was just awful.  It was just awful.  What were they doing?  Songs like Poison Ivy?  Yeah.  We used to have the CD.  Oh yeah, I did hear that.  It's like Poison Ivy comes a creepin' when you're, ain't ya bad that they pay.  Like you just throw in this bad line every so often.  Ooh. 
[02:02:00]  Harder.  Put a little hat on him and made him dance to make tourists happy.  With a muzzle on so it doesn't bite anybody.  Or talk and ruin your day.  What?  What is he talking about?  What the hell is he talking about?  That's funny.  All right, so we got some clips.  Tony Danza and Rosie O'Donnell talking here.  The retard.  Yeah.  Here's like an intro clip.  They gave me a copy of this movie.  It's called Riding the Bus With My Sister.  And it's directed by one of our dear friends, Angelica Houston, who we love. 
[02:02:30]  Yes.  And Andy McDowell's in the picture.  And, um, and you know, it's Rosie playing a, uh, a special person.  Yeah.  And.  Ah!  A retard!  Playing a special person.  Ugh.  You know Tony Danza's like, hey, he's playing a fucking retard, you know?  Yeah.  A special person.  I can't wait till she thanks him for being the inspiration in the film.  Hey, you're welcome.  All right?  Jackass.  Tony's hungry today.  People just sound stupid and uncomfortable when they're trying to be politically correct. 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  A special person.  He sounded completely uncomfortable.  Playing a, a re, a, a, a dumb, a, a special person.  Special person.  What does that mean?  Exactly.  It's not special!  I understand you want to say they're special.  If you're the parent of a, a mentally disabled child, I'm sure you want to say they're special.  They're not special. 
[02:03:30]  They, they got a problem.  They, something happened.  Why is it only in that case where something that's not good is special.  Right.  Special is always good.  Oh, look, my special girl.  Right.  Oh, look at that special, special, uh, gift I got.  Yeah.  It's very special.  Look at my special child.  Oh, the boy's an honor roll.  You're doing an HBO special.  That's right.  It's special.  Oh, and there it kind of fits in.  Yeah, but when it's bad, you know, because, uh, your kid, your kid came out, uh, with  a couple of chromosomes. 
[02:04:00]  There's a lot of people out there that would say that's not a bad thing that they had a  special kid.  Really?  Yes.  That it has enriched their lives.  Oh, I know what they got.  Whatever gets you through the day.  Sure.  I understand.  Whatever you got to pump through your mind to make it, so you don't jump out the window.  I understand.  I understand why you say special.  We all like lemonade, don't we?  Mm-hmm.  Because if you don't say special, you'll lose your mind looking at the kid next door  that came out perfect and plays baseball. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Doesn't try to eat it.  I understand.  Believe me.  But it's not special.  And hearing Tony Danza say special, you could just hear it in his voice.  It's uncomfortable and not natural.  And you don't have to say, hey, look, I hear you're playing a dummy.  But he could have said it like, hey, Rosie is playing a retarded person.  There's nothing degrading about saying retarded person.  Growth, your growth mentally has been retarded.  Retarded.  That's what it is.  Growth has been like, well in that case, it should be a stopped person. 
[02:05:00]  Because retarded implies that there's still some growth there.  So you're reversed.  Yeah.  But they don't like retarded because it implies that there's no room for growth there.  Right.  That they don't have the potential.  And of course, they're special and do have the potential.  They're not retarded.  They are advancing on it.  Retarded.  Say retarded.  Everybody knows.  All right.  So getting back to the clip, Tony Danza is starting to talk about the movie with Rosie O'Donnell. 
[02:05:30]  They gave me a copy of this movie.  It's called Riding the Bus with My Sister.  And it's directed by one of our dear friends, Angelica Houston, who we love.  Yes.  And Andy McDowell is in the picture.  And, you know, it's Rosie playing a special person.  Yeah.  And I have a picture.  First of all, here's the character.  Look at this.  Here she is.  Oh!  All right.  Who heard that?  I heard it.  You guys heard it, right?  Okay.  Fat housewife.  Oh!  Oh!  Look how dear she looks. 
[02:06:00]  Oh!  She's sitting there, and she's wearing light blue shorts, and one blue sneaker, and one  pink sneaker, and socks.  She's our own girl.  She sure is.  Yeah.  She dresses herself.  And she has fat legs with no bend marks on them, and it bothers me.  Old clay legs.  They show the picture to the audience, and you hear one lady, we backed up, go, oh.  Oh!  Know what the reaction should have been from the crowd?  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:06:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And here I have a picture.  First of all, here's the character.  Look at this.  Here she is. 
[02:07:00]  Ah!  Ah!  And I was knocked out.  I really...  I was...  First of all, this is a risky job.  You take this job.  You go, this is either going to tell me what am I thinking or the other way.  Yeah.  Or the other way.  I think you've done the other thing.  It's an incredible love story about siblings, first of all, which I love.  And um, let me show you a clip of this.  What?  What?  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be full of this.  He's a fucking dummy.  It's an incredible love story between siblings, which I love.  I love to sibble.  I do that a lot.  I enjoy it. 
[02:07:30]  The art of sibling.  What a retard.  He's a retard.  Ugh.  Trying to sell this like it's a big challenge.  You know, taking a chance to.  No, it isn't.  What else is Rosie doing?  And her dopey audience will eat this up.  Just lap this crap up.  She's wearing a hat that she stole from the set of Blossom.  Wearing like a My Little Pony t-shirt.  She's got Harpo Marks hair. 
[02:08:00]  What a wreck.  Stereotyping.  This is, I swear to you, it is so stereotyping retards.  It is.  It's a stereotype of a retard.  The voice she does, her mannerisms.  It's not like she's a great actress and studied retards and, you know, got every detail down.  This is her back in Comac in high school goofing on a retard.  It's pretty much what she's doing.  And they're filming it.  She probably had the same character during Powderpuff. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Did you guys have Powderpuff in your high school?  Where you do goofy skits for the rest of the school?  It was called the talent show.  For some reason, they called it Powderpuff.  What, Harborfield?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Awful.  I know.  Powderpuff.  Powderpuff.  Why would they call it Powderpuff?  I have no idea, man.  How gay is it?  Well, who put it on?  The drama department?  Yeah, the skits were pretty gay.  Powderpuff.  It was pretty gay.  It was pretty awful. 
[02:09:00]  It was pretty stupid.  There is not one drama department in one school anywhere in the world that is not run by gay people.  Not that there's anything wrong with it.  That's right.  Yes.  Powderpuff.  Oof.  When I was a little boy, I was in the school play.  And I only had one, like a couple lines.  I don't remember them.  But it was about a boy who was dirty.  And I said, maybe we should have him dry cleaned.  That was my acting line.  Did people laugh?  I don't remember.  I was so scared.  I stunk.  What play was it?  I don't know.  Did you have poopy in your pants? 
[02:09:30]  I'm sure I did afterwards.  Little rusty drawers.  Flattened shite.  Flattened from nervous boys sitting in it.  Maybe we should have him dry cleaned.  Maybe you should be dry cleaned.  You stink.  I crap myself.  All right.  Back to the clip here, guys.  About siblings, first of all, which I love.  And let me show you a clip of this.  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be forward to this.  What is this?  Britney Spears?  No, not Britney's. 
[02:10:00]  I'm all back.  No.  And you're a doctor.  I'm a retard.  I'm on the bus.  La, la, la, la.  I'm on the bus.  She's doing fucking Pee-wee Herman.  What is that?  Good morning, Mr. Blackface.  What was that? 
[02:10:30]  Oh, God damn it.  And Tony Dance is giving her props.  Yeah.  This is amazing.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's hear a little more.  Let me show you a clip of this.  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be forward to this.  And what is this?  Britney Spears?  Ha ha!  No, not Britney.  I'm Cole Bess.  And you're a adulto and you're new.  How do you know my name?  You're new.  Because I know everything.  Ha ha!  Listen.  You had to stop on Carlton Street. 
[02:11:00]  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Don't listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen up leg and she has to go to doctor  at 11.  So stop on Carlton Street, Rudolfo, and listen to me because I only tell you two times.  That's it.  Then you're on your own.  Morning, Mr. Blackface. 
[02:11:30]  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay!  Ha ha ha!  I pity the boy, fool.  Don't eat my cereal.  Ha ha ha!  God damn, was that funny?  That's the same glimpse!  Ha ha!  Wait, now you've got to compare the two.  You have to stop!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  What a mess!  It's the same.  She's doing pee-wee.  I would love to talk to the crew of this movie.  By the way, that scene was hysterical in the movie. 
[02:12:00]  Wait.  He's doing the Mr. Cheese cereal.  I pity the fool!  Play that clip again, and then we'll play the Rosie, the first part of the Rosie clip.  Morning, Mr. Blackface!  Ha ha!  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  I pity the boy, fool.  Don't eat my cereal.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  What is this, Britney Spears?  Ha ha ha!  No, not Britney.  And you're an adult, and you're new.  How'd you know my name?  You're new, because I know everything. 
[02:12:30]  Listen, I have to stop on Carlton Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Don't listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen-up leg,  and she has to go to the doctor at 11.  So stop on Carlton Street, Rudolpho,  and listen to me, because I only tell you two times.  That's it.  Then you're on your own.  Good morning, Mr. Backfest.  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay.  I pity the boy fool. 
[02:13:00]  Don't eat my cereal.  Great.  Her great acting job as a retard is Pee-wee Herman.  She's ripping off Pee-wee.  Okay.  Where's the bus going to stop?  Oh, my God.  Look who's on the bus.  Cowboy Curtis.  Hi, Cowboy Curtis.  Captain Carl.  Captain Carl. 
[02:13:30]  Here comes Mr. Vod, Captain Carl.  Unbelievable.  It's Pee-wee.  It's Pee-wee Herman.  I bet you, too.  I haven't seen the clip that she's not getting on a short bus.  No.  It's a regular bus.  It's a regular, like, city bus.  Oh, city bus.  Okay.  I wasn't sure if she was getting picked up for school or something.  Oh, my God.  I do like the fact that the driver scolds her.  Yeah.  It's not a stop.  Not a bus stop, you tard.  That would be worth it if everyone in the movie talked to her like that, no matter what she said.  No, it's not. 
[02:14:00]  No, it's not, dummy.  Good try.  I'm sure you'd have that little chit-chat if that happened in New York City with one of these New York City bus drivers.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure he would be just as polite.  You know what you'd hear?  Shut up.  Shut up and sit down.  I'm late.  We have to stop.  We have to stop at the other stop.  No, we just shut up.  Shut up.  Sit in your seat or I'll throw your dumb ass off.  Right.  There's no chit-chatting going on. 
[02:14:30]  Shitting and chatting.  Shut up.  You and your fat stretch Armstrong legs.  No bend marks.  No bend marks at all.  Not even a dimple.  So what do you think is going to happen to Rosie in this movie?  We should take bets.  Oh, how does it go?  You know there's going to be that dramatic moment where maybe she gets lost or something and now she's all confused looking at the big building.  That's definitely going to be a scene where she gets lost.  She gets lost, starts looking at the big buildings, and eventually I bet you they find her at the end and everything's going to be okay. 
[02:15:00]  I think that's just a sub thing.  I think the whole thing is going to be the fact that somebody will think that she's not capable of doing something.  Maybe even her sister will think that there's some kind of shortcomings because of her being a retard.  But then she will show everybody that she is indeed capable and inspire people.  I think what's going to happen is that Rosie doesn't know how to express herself, and they're going to wonder through the whole movie,  why does she buy tacos and then just rub her face in them and go, 
[02:15:30]  It's going to be a story of inspiration.  Maybe the other sister, Annie McDowell, has some kind of illness.  Ah, maybe.  They don't work.  No, you're on.  Sorry.  I'm trying to use the phone!  That's when she's at a payphone, I think. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, these are more clips of Rosie.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, these are more clips.  I thought we only had the one.  And then I guess she gets into an exchange about who the bus driver is, and the bus driver doesn't know who she is.  I know you are, but what am I?  That didn't make sense.  I meant to do that.  Okay!  There you go.  Okay!  And she has some fun in the movie, too.  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Then she can't really hear the bus driver, I guess, at one point. 
[02:16:30]  Well!  Well!  Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Yeah.  All right, now.  I cannot wait to see this movie, by the way.  Dude, I can't wait for this show.  For how I'm bashing this, cannot wait to see it.  I just want to know what the conflict's going to be.  There's going to be some stupid conflict.  Yeah.  Dumb conflict.  Yeah.  All right.  It can't just be her riding the bus the whole movie, can it?  No.  That'll be perfect.  I hope there's a little problem. 
[02:17:00]  I hope there's something.  Does she do a crying scene, you think?  You think there's a retarded crying scene in it?  No, but I'm sure Bob Kelly will be crying when he watches the movie.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Him and his bum leg.  Jesus.  That's right.  You know, it's so sweet, the siblings, and I love that.  The blubbering gimp will be on the couch eating ho-hos, just going through tissues.  We're halfway through.  Dennis Hopper's going to call.  There's a retard on the bus.  If you don't hand over the money, I'll have her talk until everybody kills himself.  Okay! 
[02:17:30]  Did they chat a little after the clip?  Yeah, yeah.  We got that.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Ha, ha, ha!  The fake laugh.  And then he laughs like a retard.  Yeah, this is where it picks up right after the clip plays, obviously.  They're going back to Tony Live.  Ha, ha, ha!  Sweet.  Very sweet.  Good job, man.  Yeah.  I haven't been able to watch it.  You haven't watched it?  No.  I watched some of the early cuts when Angelica was putting it together, and honestly, all 
[02:18:00]  credit of this movie belongs to her.  That woman is not only the best actor we have in America, but she's an amazing director.  And I had to cry a lot of this.  I was very scared of playing a role that's so challenging, and she made it easy.  Let me just hear you.  This is a kid who, her life becomes whole when she starts riding the bus.  Yes.  All the buses.  She has all the bus drivers, all the passengers.  She knows everybody and everything about them.  Right.  And that's sort of all she does. 
[02:18:30]  She has a form of mental retardation.  She falls somewhere in the autism spectrum, and she will only do the bus.  So when the buses are off on Sunday, she just waits at home until the bus is, she's the  first one at the stop.  Every time she tells people who's been on, who's been off, and she knows everything there  is to know about the buses.  And, um...  Did you meet the real Beth, or...?  You know, I didn't.  But she's a real person.  She sure is.  That's right.  And her sister, Rachel, takes care of her.  And Rachel sort of felt it would be very disruptive for Beth to meet new people. 
[02:19:00]  And, um...  So I didn't meet her.  But I have a friend who has a sister named Cynthia, who is very much like Beth.  And instead of the buses, she loves Broadway.  So she knows everything about Broadway, what show was on where, and what theater, and what  day.  And, um...  So I went to see a few shows with Cynthia, and a lot of my character is based on Cynthia,  as well as a tape that I saw of Beth.  But I never did get to meet her, although, um...  She really understands the shows.  ...her whole dream of her life is to go to Disney World.  So when the movie wrapped, I got her four tickets on the sleeper bus. 
[02:19:30]  The Greyhound bus to go to Disney World.  Yeah, you see.  She'll meet new people.  Right.  She'll meet people on the bus.  This is what I thought.  I hope it ends up on the side of a ditch on 95.  You know, they have to wait until she's in a place where she understands that she's  going to go, and her therapist will go with her.  But I hope she gets to do that.  I wonder if they put her on the bus so the fucking dummy didn't charge the cockpit.  Put her on a bus.  That's great.  That's great for the poor minimum wage Disney employees down there having to deal with that. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  That's great.  Thank you, Rosie.  A sleeper bus.  You're just a wonderful American.  You always do the right thing.  I gotta tell you.  Like, it's not bad enough to be on a bus either, you know?  To be on a bus.  And this nut's gotta be on there.  Oh, little kid at Disney.  Mommy, who's wearing the dumbbell costume?  Now, now.  Now, now.  Jesus.  Oh, that ain't good. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, that bugged me.  What a method actress.  Yeah, I watched the tape.  Boy, way to throw yourself into the role, fatso.  Didn't even meet the girl.  I guess she would have been, like she said, too.  Which only goes to show you, she's probably 8 billion times more crazy in real life than  Rosie's playing her up to be.  Rosie's gonna play her up to be, you know, oh, look how sweet and look how functional.  She should have got ready for the role by sniffing glue.  So, before every take, just put that bag up to your mouth, sniff paint, glue, paint thinner. 
[02:21:00]  Jesus, De Niro would have done it.  Hey, how did you prepare for the role?  Well, I crawled into my mother's womb and I had her drink.  Big bag of lead paint chips.  Just chowing down.  Seeing some stupid movie, making believe it's popcorn. 
[02:21:30]  Cutting her own oxygen off for way longer than she should.  And when I start to black out, take the bag off my head.  Hey, you know, De Niro would have done it that way.  Right.  Everyone knows what he did to get ready for the Raging Bull.  That's a real actor.  That is a real actor.  Look at this.  She watches a tape of a retard and she's got it down.  Goes to a Broadway show with someone who just ruins the play for everyone. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  Why is that person doing that?  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Oh, just the shushes that must have been going on.  That's pretty.  The dress is up.  Shh.  Shut up.  Dolt.  Imagine getting stuck behind that head.  Big giant head.  Can't see the set.  Had to wait a year to get these tickets.  Anything. 
[02:22:30]  This daytime hack just gets front row.  Oh.  Steve C's there.  I really, I just wanted to say, I thought you did a wonderful job.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Could you cut some liners for us?  Steve C's a big Broadway fan.  Oh, is he really?  Yeah.  Goes to a lot of shows.  He doesn't.  Yes, he does.  Let's go to Zach.  Zach.  Yo.  Come on, Zach.  Hey, I know the dramatic event in Rosie's movie. 
[02:23:00]  Huh.  Bob Kelly's going to take her to the basement and hold a rock over her until she puts out.  Bunch it out, boys.  Have a good one.  Yeah.  You know.  What are you doing?  I'm being gang banged.  We haven't explored this emotional side of Bob Kelly.  We have to call him and see if this is the type of movie he would cry over.  If he knows that we're all looking, he probably wouldn't.  Yeah.  Because he'd fight it, put a loan on his couch.  If he was home alone, he'd be blubbering.  With that dumb leg up, smoking a cigarette. 
[02:23:30]  Dude, Bob will do this.  This is what Bob does.  He rehearses what he's going to say.  This is what a bore Bob is, and I hope you're listening, stupid.  You'll show up, and he'll just sit down, and he'll be like, you know, dude, and he'll  just start talking, and it's like, you rehearsing motherfucker.  Don't have these.  He rehearses, like, just conversation.  He, Bob wants to be smart, so he'll walk around the house and just go, you know, dude,  and he'll, like, pontificate and sound smart to him because he's an idiot, and then you  sit down, and you're like, you are fucking, what is this droll nonsense you're firing at  me?  Dude, you know, the government, shut up. 
[02:24:00]  Shut your mouth.  We've got to get Bob Kelly on today.  Ben's listening.  He'll try to get it.  I want to punch him right in his bad knee, right in that ripped tendon.  I want to just drill my fist.  You're calling him good.  Waylon from Georgia.  Yes, sir.  I have a little thing.  I say we hang her, then we scare her, then we run her over.  Not even going to wait for him to finish.  Oh, really? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, he was doing a lot.  All right.  Pat from Boston.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I think on the bus, she's going to get her period, and her sister's going to show her how  to put on a pad, and then everything will be okay.  The pad.  Push it out.  Now, make sure you roll it up in tissue paper and put it in the nearest waste paper basket.  And wave it in the bus driver's face.  Slap him in the face with it.  Blindside him.  While you're putting your fare in, just pull out your used pad and whack him in the face with it. 
[02:25:00]  And we'll see what kind of patience the bus driver really has.  Smacking over his mouth in a mock kidnapping.  Joe from Chicago.  What's cracking, boys?  What's up, Joe?  What's up, Joe?  I've been listening to you guys for about two weeks now.  I am infected.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you, Joe.  Oh, is it me that Rose looks like a half a retard already?  Rosie?  She already has Down syndrome.  She kind of has that look, the big fat head.  They have to keep stopping her going, look, could you look a little smarter? 
[02:25:30]  You know, this girl isn't really this stupid.  I think...  The only good ending for this movie would be if she gets hit by a bus.  That's the ironic ending.  Yeah, go for the ironic ending.  She actually gets hit by a bus.  The bus runs over her retard head and breaks its axle.  And she survives.  That big thing pull away. 
[02:26:00]  What happened?  What an annoyance.  You trying to go to work, read the Times?  And so-and-so, shut your face.  Ugh.  Alice, some retard got on my bus today.  Just yapping.  Yapping, yapping, yapping. 
[02:26:30]  Big head takes up that whole mirror that they get to look in the backseat with.  You move that fat thing.  Do you bribe a dust?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  You're a retard.  Holy crap.  Clear the field.  Some men are going to drive some retards around.  Oh, stupid.  A mirror bag of chromosomes? 
[02:27:00]  Just wish I could do the voice.  I don't even have, I don't do the voice.  Gee, I never knew Davy Crockett was so dumb.  Harvey, Harvey, I got a friend, Beth, smarter than you. 
[02:27:30]  One of these days, pow, right in the fat tongue.  Because you're a mongoloid.  A mongoloid.  Mr. Fabasham, if you think I'm driving that retard around, it's out of the question. 
[02:28:00]  Out of the question.  Beth, you've come back.  Oh, my head.  Yeah.  All right, let's move on here.  Let's go to Mandy.  Hey, Mandy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Mandy?  Nothing.  I wanted to tell you that this is based on a true story.  Yes.  Yeah, Rosie was sort of saying that in that last clip. 
[02:28:30]  It was based on a true story, so I know how it ends.  Oh.  Oh, if you guys want to know.  Hell yeah, we want to know how it ends.  She gets a bum leg while Rosie, the retard, she gets a bum leg and her sister has to come  and it ruins her life.  And then the bus driver takes over and takes care of Rosie.  Oh!  The bus driver takes care of her?  She gets on the leg and she can't walk, she has to be wheeled around, and the bus driver 
[02:29:00]  comes to the rescue and takes care of her, and she lives at his house.  Oh.  So it's not that great of an ending, but.  Lives at the bus driver's house?  Jeez, what's happening there?  Yeah, what is up with that?  A little diddle?  As long as she can take a little diddle.  All right, guys, punch it out.  All right.  Bye-bye.  That's what he was saying to her.  Her little dumb face in the pillow, she's confused.  That's right.  Earn your keep.  Earn your keep.  What is Eric having?  I didn't know what the rest of this was. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, I think I know what he's saying.  Oh, okay.  Eric from Staten Island.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a big peek of the movie.  The subplot is the bus gets a flat tire, and Rosie with her retard strength picks up the  bus because she didn't have a jack.  Punch it out.  With that retard strength.  I got it.  This bit is picking up momentum.  Boys and girls.  Let's go to Chris. 
[02:30:00]  Hey, Chris.  You're on the Opie and Anthony program.  How you guys doing?  We're having a good time today.  I hope someone's enjoying this crap.  Hey, I'll tell you what, man.  The retard stuff is not funny, but I was laughing my ass off.  That is some funny shit right there.  Oh, all right.  We turned you around a little bit.  Hey, get a load of retard over there.  Oh, Pat.  Mom, Mom.  Yes, honey?  You know when we were talking yesterday? 
[02:30:30]  Yes, we were.  Do you know about periods?  Yes.  What about periods?  Do you have periods?  Yes.  All women have periods.  Tell me what happens.  Blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Do you have a question, Jill?  Yes.  I want to know if Susie has periods.  Susie?  Yes, Mom?  Jill wants to know something.  We want, Jill.  Susie, do you have periods? 
[02:31:00]  Do I have periods?  Jill, all women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  When I'm on my period, blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Susie, what about my teacher?  Does Miss Jones have periods?  Yes, Jill.  Your teacher, Mrs. Jones, does have periods.  All women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  Well?  Well?  That's from the tradables audio, yes.  Good morning, Mr. Tampon! 
[02:31:30]  You should see.  I do get a chance to watch the clip of the period.  I still have not seen the video.  It's up on foundrymusic.com, right?  Who the little girl in this, the retarded little girl that they're teaching look like?  And then I realize, because I watch Close Encounters, like one of the aliens that come off of the ship.  Her face has that same look.  Okay.  And the older sister is telling her about periods, pulls down her pants, and shows this used pad.  This big old 50s pad. 
[02:32:00]  You can get to the video clips by going to opianthony.com.  Yes.  I'm a little distracted because the listeners are taking over the bit slightly here.  Joe in Jersey.  Go ahead, Joe.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  My favorite part of the movie is when Eric Logan takes her to his barber.  Punching out.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, over the fence with that one. 
[02:32:30]  The listeners are taking over, Anthony.  Let's go to Tom on Long Island.  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Jimmy, love you.  Thanks, bud.  Hey, I heard the sequel to this takes place in Israel, and Rosie's wearing a big puffy coat on the bus.  Punching out, guys.  Oh, wow.  Duke in Jersey.  What's up, Duke?  Duke.  Yes, I'm here.  What's up, Duke?  Oh, I was just going to say that Rosie has to go and rent out all of Giovanni Ribisi's movies to research a retard role. 
[02:33:00]  Yes, Giovanni Ribisi.  The really extraordinary.  All right.  We have a third clip, Anthony, from the Tony Danza show from yesterday.  Is this another clip from the movie or the same clip?  No, it's the same clip.  Oh, hold on, buddy.  It's the same clip, but without the Tony Danza stuff around it.  It's just the clip from the movie.  Oh, man.  We're going to have to wait until Monday.  I can't believe we have to wait. 
[02:33:30]  Monday, we're going to have probably 20 clips.  Why couldn't we get a screener copy of this?  They wouldn't send one over?  We should be able to see these in advance so we can comment.  We're probably going to give this show great ratings.  People are going to watch it just to see Rosie's standout performance as a retard.  You know, it's going to be hilarious, the confusion at the hallmark offices, like when they get the overnight ratings.  Why is this show number one, men, 18 and 34?  We made this movie for, you know, middle-aged housewives. 
[02:34:00]  Housewives.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Let's listen to the clip one more time, then.  This is the only one we got.  I know.  I can't wait.  What is this?  Britney Spears?  Okay.  No, not Britney Spears.  I'm Cole Best.  And you're a adult, so you're new.  How do you know my name?  You're new, because I know everything.  Well, listen, you have to stop on Carlton Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen up leg and she has to go to the doctor at 11.  So stop on Carlton Street, Rudolpho, and listen to me because I only tell you two times.  That's it.  Then you're on your own.  Morning, Mr. Beckfest.  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay.  I pity the poor fool.  Don't eat my cereal.  All right.  The pack has a swollen leg. 
[02:35:00]  Aw.  See, they're making Beth look like she's the helpful one.  Right.  Like she knows everybody in the community.  How could she be retarded, yet she knows everything?  She could remember the names of the passengers and the bus drivers and the bus routes.  It's amazing.  It's special.  And the only thing she enjoys is riding the bus.  Riding the bus.  And that's the only thing she can't do anymore.  There you go.  Because she has a bum leg.  She's got a bum leg.  So she can't ride the bus?  Yeah.  And that was her whole life.  It must be like, what?  What kind of bum leg? 
[02:35:30]  A Mabel King bum leg?  Because that's a bum leg.  What kind of bum leg?  But she can't ride the bus and the bus driver takes her in.  Oh.  You know there's something going on there.  Absolutely.  His poker buddies come over.  They'll jump on.  Hey.  George?  Hey, guys.  What's up, George?  Hey, the interview between Tony and Rosie.  Which one was the idiot or the retard?  Ah, fuck.  Punching out.  You, Sean.  You are.  Wow.  You had a good one, too. 
[02:36:00]  You stuttering prick, you?  Which one's the person?  You're a fresh, nervous, nervous, nervous, zilch.  Hum-na, hum-na.  From O&A Pictures comes a story of three friends.

The Technophile.  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  When you have an Internet connection at home, you can access any website you want.  But from your mobile phone, the providers are setting up a system where you have to pay  to access specific sites.  The recent announcement that MySpace will be available on singular phones is great.  Except when you see it costs three bucks a month. 
[02:41:00]  Singular subscribers will download a MySpace application and be able to add friends, pictures,  et cetera.  Plus, you have to pay for data charges.  As TechDirt.com points out, people are already able to access MySpace.com from their T-Mobile  sidekick devices.  Why one mobile company is charging for access to a site and another isn't is more of the  mystery of the mobile phone industry in the United States.  YouTube announced a huge deal with Verizon where the company picks a few videos and then  you get to pay to watch them.  Though you're sure to be frustrated when you find out that someone at Verizon is cherry 
[02:41:30]  picking what you can watch online.  In the end, make sure you look for a phone that allows mobile web access, like a smartphone,  rather than just one that gives you access to specific websites for an additional fee.  I'm Laszlo.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  The virus is an Excel channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-Canada, 877-438-9676.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  It doesn't get any worse than this.  Wrong-o.  And now, the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  What do you want to do?  Riding on the bus?  Yeah.  Let's get into that a little bit.  I just think we should watch where the jokes go.  I think that, um, let's not target the mentally challenged.  I agree with you.  Yeah.  Take the high road.  Yeah.  Jack.  All right.  I like how, actually, even though it's radio, he puts the serious face on. 
[02:42:30]  You know, guys, there's not even a hint of a smile.  I'm a method actor.  He's acting.  He really has to get into the character.  You know, all right, let me really think that I don't want to make jokes about this.  All right.  All right.  I'll wait.  Okay.  Here was, uh, Rosie O'Donnell.  I gotta admit, I took a peek after Family Guy.  Ugh.  It was not just an awful movie because of the content and Rosie O'Donnell being a horrible 
[02:43:00]  actress and just running through as a parody of a retarded person.  The movie itself, taken just as a movie, was so bad.  It was so disjointed and cliches left and right.  They kept throwing in these little things that lasted for a second that were supposed  to make you think about something, I guess.  I don't know.  There was one part where they tried to get into this little story of this pervert that  drives around and gives Rosie O'Donnell's retard character a stuffed animal in the car 
[02:43:30]  and goes, here you go.  And he looks all ratty and he pulls up slowly as she's walking on the sidewalk and she grabs  the stuffed animal and then walks a little like, oh no, and puts it in the garbage and  goes, that guy always tries to give me things.  And then that was it.  Dude, it lasted for like five seconds.  Like, oh, the retards have to watch for the perverts.  Yes, okay.  I understand where they were going.  Because that's what's happening out there.  Yeah, yeah.  What is the pervert retarded to? 
[02:44:00]  When you looked at.  I think that you're missing the message, Anthony.  Yeah, what was it?  The message there, that's the message to the parents, where if you have one of these,  this is what you should do with it.  Walk right outside, lift the lid.  Toss it in the garbage.  But they tried little things like that, like they were trying to make these points, but  they were covered so quickly, like, okay, let's cover the pervert trying to pick her  up.  All right, let's get the mean, intolerant people on the bus.  Like, she gets on the bus and there's the bus drivers, which are all, every one of them, 
[02:44:30]  very tolerant, very nice to her, very understanding.  And then a couple of passengers that, as viewers, you're supposed to hate.  Because they're like, what is she doing on this bus?  She doesn't have the proper past.  She's annoying.  And they're saying all this out loud, like no one would ever speak this shit.  You say it under your breath and you kick them while they're not looking.  Things like, fun things like that.  Pinch their side fat.  Yeah.  Oh, get away from me. 
[02:45:00]  And then one of the most unrealistic parts of the movie, when somebody getting on the  bus needed a nickel, didn't have a nickel, and a black gentleman actually gave a nickel.  Oh, that was, I saw that scene.  I was like, stop it.  That was Rosie's sister there.  He looked like a thug.  He looked like a thug, but he's very charitable.  Well, then she tries to give him a dollar.  And he's like, yo, lady, you can't buy anything for five cents nowadays.  Uh-huh.  Something like that.  And then there was one intolerant black woman.  Rosie gets on the bus and she starts making retard faces at these two black children that 
[02:45:30]  are sitting there.  And the black woman saw that the children were making faces back.  And she kind of takes them by the hands and moved her seat.  She went to the back of the bus, which somebody on Wackbag right when it happened wrote, wow,  I guess old habits die young.  Or something like that.  Old habits die hard.  Oh, I suck.  But apparently.  Oh, what's your favorite song? 
[02:46:00]  Only the good die hard.  Only the good die hard.  Oh, what a tool.  I stink.  Now we know what you meant.  Yeah.  So did I.  Fortunately, it came out of my mouth like diarrhea.  That's all right.  Jim in Philly thought the movie wasn't that bad.  Jim?  What?  Yes.  Hey, Jim.  All right.  I like you very much.  Yeah, I'm a faggot.  Hi, Jimmy.  I bought your new CD.  It's pretty good.  Thank you very much.  Why are you breathing like you just ate it?  Because I'm a fat fuck. 
[02:46:30]  That's honest.  Well, there goes that question.  You like the movie there, Jim?  Yes, I do.  I had a retarded sister and it brought back a lot of things.  Did she ride the bus?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  No.  So it brought back a lot of what?  Like a lot of memories?  A lot of bad.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of bad.  My brother and I were constantly in fights, you know, protecting her and, you know, because  people would make fun of her.  That seemed very unrealistic.  Yeah.  What would they say to your sister? 
[02:47:00]  What would they say to her?  A lot.  You know, hey, you fucking retard.  You know, hey, you're going to talk like fucking Pee Wee Herman.  No.  No.  Is she still around?  Pee Wee Herman, but no, she died when she was 26.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[02:47:30]  She ain't heavy.  She's my retarded sister.  That's true.  And I do drive a bus in Philadelphia.  We do get a lot of retarded. 
[02:48:00]  You do?  Are you the tolerant bus driver?  Sometimes, sometimes not.  Yeah.  Wow.  When they stand up at the bus and they start fucking hollering and screaming, you know, you've got time to put it in.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, that's great.  That's what you want to deal with.  He had a sister that was retarded.  He's not tolerant.  You just want to get through your day driving the bus and you get this in the back.  Make somebody stop at that other bus stop. 
[02:48:30]  But the one truth in the story was a lot of them that get on do know everything there is to know about buses, bus lines, everything.  Yeah, that's quite a resume stuffer.  Great.  Well, most of them don't work or they do menial jobs for the IRS.  Why do they choose?  Wait, wait, wait.  Who do they work for?  I get a lot of them that work for the IRS, International Revenue Service.  International Revenue Service.  Did you say the International Revenue Service? 
[02:49:00]  I deserved the car crash on that.  Of course you did.  That was a bus crash because, A, retards working for the IRS was the joke, and international, they don't tax us in Greece and Europe and here.  It's internal, sir.  The International Revenue Service.  All right, well, Jim liked the movie.  Yeah.  And I appreciate you touring on me.  All right, Jim.  Bye, Jim.  Have a good one, guys.  See you.  You know what, I like those Die Young movies, the three that came out, Bruce Willis.  Old Habits Die Young. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, that ass.  All right, here we go.  God.  Riding the bus with my sister.  What else were you going to say about this movie?  A lot, another thing that was going on during the whole thing, and I don't know if this was just part of Rosie's contract or the character was supposed to be like this.  She was eating in every scene.  Eating in every single scene.  And she was unhealthy.  She went to the doctor, and the doctor told her she's overweight and stuff, and somebody pointed out on the message board that this woman is, this doctor is bashing Rosie's character, yet it's still Rosie that she's telling is unhealthy. 
[02:50:00]  The only difference is this retarded character didn't wash her hair.  That was like the only difference between the retard and Rosie.  So this woman saying how unhealthy and fat Rosie is as the retard, meanwhile, she didn't have padding on her or anything.  She's just fat.  Oh, that's great.  So they're pounding her.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Fat clay legs with no Ben Marchant.  And, you know, I know it's very, you know, hack as a comics to talk of the big head gag. 
[02:50:30]  Hey, big head.  That's a big head.  You know, but her head is giant.  She has this, that big, fat head.  And at one point she was getting a hairstyle.  Her hairstyle, her sister took her, and they formed her curly locks into a perfect mullet.  Could not possibly have made her look more retarded.  You know who should cut her hair?  David Ferry and Clay Shaw. 
[02:51:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Hmm.  Eh.  Yeah, I'm thinking.  Yeah, I, I got JFK.  Yeah.  I got you.  Didn't really go over well.  All right.  Do you want to play some clips, then?  Let's do it and say die young.  Well, he did.  Here's Rosie's character on the phone, I guess.  I'm trying to use that phone.  No, that's peewee.  Yes, darling.  Hi, honey.  You okay?  Yes, I'm okay. 
[02:51:30]  I'm okay, because I'm the sheriff.  Yeah.  You have to take me to Super Save tomorrow, because I have a sale.  Okay, I'm going to pick you up at 6.  Yeah, 6.30.  I love you.  I have to go.  I have to go catch a bus.  Oh.  I have to go catch a bus.  Oh, you are a bus, you pig.  Okay.  Why are you so tolerant of the retard?  I'm the sheriff.  No, you're not, stupid.  I'm the sheriff. 
[02:52:00]  Somebody had the storyline all wrong, also.  They told us that at the end, she gets a bum leg.  Yeah, yeah.  And has to live with them.  And then I realized that was the storyline of Bill.  Somebody was trying to fool us.  Oh, okay.  That was the storyline of old Bill.  Remember when Mickey Rooney played a retard?  We have to get the Bill clips.  He was, I had a bad leg, and I have to live with Barry.  And that's what happened.  He had a bum leg.  He would have had to go back to the home.  Oh, okay.  So he lived with the death quaid.  Someone got one past us, huh?  I know.  I didn't realize it until last night, when I'm like, hey, wait. 
[02:52:30]  It didn't end like that.  That's one of our favorite comedies.  Of course it is.  How did it end?  I didn't see it.  Well, it ended the sister.  Well, the father that she's talking to on the phone, he dies.  He winds up dying.  And now he took care of Rosie's character for the most part.  Rosie lived alone, but I guess he helped her out, whatever.  So now the sister, who is a very successful career woman, has to now come and kind of take care of her a little bit and leave her job for a while. 
[02:53:00]  And she winds up breaking up with her fiancé because of the problem with the sister.  Yeah, that would happen in real life.  Yeah.  Of course.  She's a mess!  Sorry.  And now the movie is pretty much the sister trying to get a better understanding of her retarded sister because they haven't been together in years.  She's been a busy career girl, you know.  She doesn't even acknowledge she's got this retard for a sister.  What's there to understand?  Nothing.  This movie was so shallow and had nothing to it. 
[02:53:30]  They can't even watch the same TV programs.  So they drive on the bus together, and then Rosie tries hooking her up with the bus drivers.  This is my sister, and she broke up with a boyfriend, and she reads books, and she...  Oh, and she just kind of smiles like it's okay, instead of slapping her in the face and telling her to shut up like any normal human would do.  She should have pinched the back of her arm and just said, shut up.  Yeah, shut up.  Ow!  Here's the argument on the stairs, Anthony.  What was this about? 
[02:54:00]  I don't know.  I couldn't even understand the movie.  All right.  I was a retard watching it.  What do you think you are, a hippopotamus?  The way you plop down the steps every morning?  Some people are still sleeping.  Not you.  You're not sleeping.  You're complaining.  That's what you're doing.  You're the hippopotamus!  Yeah, that was her walking downstairs.  Wow, there's a lot of fat jokes in this movie, huh?  Well, yeah.  Well, she's fat.  Yeah, a big black woman is yelling at her for clomping down the stairs. 
[02:54:30]  Every day you are first person on my bus.  Yeah.  She'd kill some lady to get on first.  I wouldn't.  I wouldn't kill.  She's got no place to go.  Just rides around all day.  So, it's a free country.  I'm a person.  I buy my bus pass for 40 bucks, and I'm first always, so that's why I'm first.  Yeah, you're doing it on the government dole.  Why don't you do something useful in your life?  Okay, Henry.  Where is Beth going today? 
[02:55:00]  I'm going to go to Elm, and then I'm going to catch a bus with Rick.  Ah, Rick is your new favorite.  Yeah, because he has a green car, and he's cute.  A green Mustang.  Very classy.  Yeah.  I think he's going to take me for a ride in it.  What about your boyfriend?  What about Jesse?  Jesse's delicious.  He's going to take me today to get a new toilet seat, because mine got broken and was sliding.  So, I'm going to fall off of it, like, whoa. 
[02:55:30]  Fat ass sitting on it.  Fat, retarded ass broke the toilet seat.  Why did somebody cut Henry off?  I really liked him.  Henry was telling it like it is.  She had a boyfriend, by the way.  She had a boyfriend, Jesse, who was this big, retarded black guy.  So, she, um, and apparently they were having sex and everything.  Was he saying Camo?  Camo.  Camo with glass dildos.  Camo.  Yeah, that was another, you know, this whole thing was just full of this politically correct drivel. 
[02:56:00]  Just awfulness.  Like the people in the bus, the angry people, you know.  Why don't you get a job instead of being on the government dole?  And you're supposed to look over and go, yeah, that person's mean and awful.  Oh, and it's like every two seconds these little things were popping up.  The intolerant gang of white guys that beat up the black, uh, that were trying to beat  up the black, her black boyfriend.  Of course.  And he knows Taekwondo.  Yeah, the retarded black boyfriend. 
[02:56:30]  So, he kicked ass.  And he's got the retard strength, too.  Yeah, he had the retard strength.  And he kicked ass.  Gotta be kind of stupid to take on a guy like that.  People started, uh, uh, getting ready to attack him and Rosie goes, it's getting hot  in here.  It's getting hot in here.  And he ran over in his Taekwondo duds.  They criticized her and he went, you motherfucker.  Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Don't you think that, uh, that Rosie sounds like Barney Gumbel from The Simpsons?  All right, that's good.  That's good.  Sometimes it's pee-wee. 
[02:57:00]  All right, sometimes it's Barney.  It's just minus the burp, right?  That's good.  The worst part of it is I was only able to whack my bag twice during that.  Peace out.  Very good.  Guy had a really good call.  So wait a minute, not only was Rosie a retard, but she was in, oh, oh, oh, a two-time  disappointer of the family.  Oh, my God.  Father's like, it just couldn't get any worse. 
[02:57:30]  Daddy, meet.  I stand corrected.  Okay, it can.  That's nice.  And both races will be destroyed.  They'll create a mongrel race.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, it's great.  Andy McDowell was the sister.  Yes.  She was the sister.  And, uh, I guess the beginning shot, the opening shot of the movie was pretty good.  She's kind of laying back on the bed and her nips were showing through the sweater.  Yeah.  So that was, like, the best part of the movie. 
[02:58:00]  I'm my savior.  I'm not your savior.  I'm just Beth.  Who's Beth?  Beth, my girlfriend.  Oh, it's boring clothes.  What, am I scaring you?  What made it scare you?  Boom, boom, boom!  Beth.  Yeah.  Bear in no mind.  It's just a harmless retard.  Just don't make eye contact.  I'm having you!  That is hilarious. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, is that the best line ever?  Another intolerant person on the bus.  Meanwhile, to me, those are the best people so far.  Of course.  Hendry and those two.  Hendry.  They're an intolerant person.  It's just a harmless retard.  Don't make eye contact.  Absolutely true.  Oh, wow.  Dummy with panda legs.  That's what she has.  Legs like a fat white panda.  She should be tugging a windbreaker through a cage.  Fat whore. 
[02:59:00]  Panda.  I'm hearing you.  When are you going to take me for a ride in your car?  In a green car, my case worker.  Oh, Olivia, huh?  Yes, Olivia.  She's pretty and she's nice.  Oh, that's the house where me and Eugene live.  I think he's a jerk.  You think he's a jerk, Rick?  I don't think he's a jerk.  I think he's a little impatient.  Yeah, well, he put up that sign in the bathroom that says only employees can use it. 
[02:59:30]  That didn't stop you, though, did it?  No, because I'm a person and it's just a bathroom.  If I use it, I don't think I'm hurting anybody.  Yeah, that's great.  Employees work all day.  Sometimes I go in there if I don't have to go to the bathroom just to wash my hands and make them mad.  Just to wash my hands.  How stupid can one person be?  Sometimes I just wash my hands. 
[03:00:00]  You work hard and that dummy walks in and takes one of her retard dumps, just gum and pennies in it.  Little shards of glass and fur.  That was part of the movie was that she ate everything, which is good for Rosie O'Donnell. 
[03:00:30]  But as a kid, they did a lot of flashbacks where they showed her as a little kid, which is great for the kid's image as an actress.  You know, you're really good.  I think you can play a fat retard.  Here you go.  You're the fat retarded girl.  And she was eating everything.  She was outside eating dirt.  They had her eating dirt.  They had her eating paint.  The paint, she was trying to do a little painting, and she was eating the paint.  And that's what Rosie grew into, somebody that just...  Oh, my God.  The inside of the toilet looks like Dreyfuss' living room in Close Encounters. 
[03:01:00]  This means something.  I've got a big...  There's a mountain in my toilet.  I don't know.  Maybe if I put some lines in the side, it'll ring a bell.  Be realistic, Rick. 
[03:01:30]  Be...  Be...  Open your eyeballs, and you can see that he's a little bit of a jerk.  I can't...  Oh, Shanelle, you're growing.  Yeah, I'm as big as a truck.  Oh, sit here, sit here.  You want to feel them kick?  It's a pregnant woman.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Put your hands on my tummy. 
[03:02:00]  He's moving all over the place.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness!  Oh, Rick!  Rick, you want to touch that?  I'm driving here, babe.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have something to show you.  Oh, yeah?  Look.  Oh.  This is my niece and my nephew, Alex and Maddie.  Adorable.  Yeah, I love him so much.  I never met him, but my brother says, come bring him over, Bobby.  Sure, yeah.  They're cute.  They're so cute. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, thank you.  Is the pregnant woman patting her own stomach and looking at the retard and then looking up  going, please, God, please.  Please.  Hey, Rick, what are you doing?  Stop singing that song.  It's going to get you fired.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Man.  Okay, Jesse, here they are.  I like the fishies. 
[03:03:00]  What do you like?  Uh, this one.  This one.  This one's salt.  Retarded boyfriend.  Oh, but Jesse, that one's ugly.  Nobody wants to sit on that.  You know me.  I'm fussy.  Sit on.  Yeah.  We need some help.  Can we have assistants playing in row number one for Toilet Seat?  Hello?  Toilet Seat assistants in row number one.  Thank you.  Okay.  I love this joint anyway. 
[03:03:30]  Well, well.  See we.  She's atrocious.  Sweet Corn Smile from Syracuse.  Rosie sounds like the Saturday Night Live skit Amy Poehler does as the little girl.  Yeah.  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.  Hey!  Over here!  Ha ha!  Oh, she is awful.  Oh, this is great.  It is so bad.  It's such a bad.  You can't get over the put-on retard that she's doing. 
[03:04:00]  This over-the-top bad.  That's what I saw.  Oh, it's horrible.  So far, Henry and those other two guys are my favorite characters on television.  Henry.  That sounds like the cookie monster a little bit, too.  C is for chromosome, which I do not have.  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha! 
[03:04:30]  Ha ha!  All right, I guess this is where the movie gets very dramatic, Anthony.  The father has a heart attack.  Hangers are more for just than hanging your clothes.  Ha ha ha!  Hangers are used for things other than just hanging your clothes.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Oh, I feel it.  The father has a heart attack?  Yes, this is where the father dies, I guess. 
[03:05:00]  They have to call up Rosie and she runs to the hospital and it's trying to be a touching  scene and it was nothing but humor.  Ha ha ha!  It's just funny.  When was the last time she saw her father?  I talked to him all the time on the phone.  But he was much too busy to visit her?  No, no, I guess he would visit her too and give her things.  So, you know, I guess they were close.  I tried to reach you at home, but I missed you.  You must have already left.  Yeah, well, I was here.  Would you like a cookie?  It's chocolate flavor.  Very nutritious. 
[03:05:30]  Eating again.  No, thanks.  But, um, is there someplace we can go?  What for?  Beth, your dad, uh, I'm afraid your father's had a heart attack.  Ha ha ha!  Oh, no.  No!  My dad's taking me to Super Save.  I'm going to go get rich!  What?  Beth!  Beth, um, slow down.  He's had, he's had surgery.  I, I think you might, you might just want to...  Beth!  Beth!  Beth!  Beth!  Excuse me, sorry. 
[03:06:00]  Excuse me, I'm just going to pass me.  The running retard scene.  The panicking retard.  Beth's dad is in the hospital.  Massive heart attack.  You okay, Beth?  Yeah, time to start the bus.  Let's go!  I'm pretty fucking soft.  I'm okay.  Ah, you're about to slow, Rick.  I'm going to report you.  Beth.  No!  No, I love you.  Everybody has a schedule.  I've got a schedule.  I'm going to go on Happy Timmy's bus tonight.  That's why it is.  Beth, can I call someone for you?  Rick, you're cute, but your clothes are faded and they're not very nice. 
[03:06:30]  I mean, look at my clothes.  They're very bright.  I give everybody lots of color.  Oh, where is it?  St. Matthew's.  Beth, listen to me.  No.  Your dad's in the hospital.  Yeah.  I have to go to the hospital.  I'll take you there.  Now you're rude.  There's other people on the bus, by the way, and he's just going to, you know, hey, we've  got to go to the hospital.  That would happen in real life.  Excuse me.  That would happen.  Fired.  Where's your pass, fatso?  I don't have it.  Then get off. 
[03:07:00]  You would be fired for that.  Of course.  You didn't take the bus off the route.  All right.  And now she's visiting her father in the hospital.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, no.  Poor Simon.  Where's my daddy?  Where's my daddy?  Oh!  He's coming through the hall.  He's in a coma.  He's unconscious.  He won't even know you're here.  Yes, he will, because he's knowing.  I think it's important for Beth to see her dad.  No!  I want to see him!  Oh!  Oh! 
[03:07:30]  Father's, like, finally in peace.  Oh, daddy!  I didn't want you to see him this way.  He's just pretending he can't hear her?  Oh, daddy!  I will hurt you!  It's me, the sheriff!  Dad!  Can you hear me?  Oh, dad!  You're going to take me to super safe today!  You have to wake up!  You have to wake up!  It's you, me!  Dad, we make a good team!  It's you, me!  You're not going to die, Izzy! 
[03:08:00]  Okay!  Beth, he's not so loud.  But he's not going to die, right?  Maybe you'd like to come outside and sit down.  Baby, you should do something!  You just stand there!  You're doing nothing!  Beth, please, calm down.  It's time we let your dad rest.  No, it's not time!  I'm going to stay here!  It's not time!  You have to cooperate.  You are not my mother!  You're not!  That doesn't mind how I am!  I was, I'd have thrown myself down the stairs. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was the, uh, the heart-tugging scene.  That was the...  Rosie crying.  Now she's got to move on and get along without her dad to help her.  So, that's where her sister is.  I mean, there's a ton of, of clips still to go here.  Which ones do you want to go to?  I don't know.  Let me see.  One, two, three.  They all stink.  Birthday party on the bus.  How about the ones where bees sting her fat legs?  While she rolls around confused in the yard. 
[03:09:00]  It was just such a, a horrible movie.  Like, it's just her walking around pretty much doing what we've already heard.  Yeah.  This bad retard voice put in situations that garner her no sympathy whatsoever from the audience watching.  She's just an annoying, ugh.  And, um...  Oh, well, there's the Hallmark retard commercial.  All right.  They were...  Now, during this whole movie, which was sponsored by Hallmark, 29.  Sponsored by Hallmark.  Every commercial break, there were, like, two of these drama commercials. 
[03:09:30]  They went on and on forever.  And it was supposed to, you know, be feel-good.  And, uh, one was how this little boy comes home from school and his teacher gave him a card because he was good, nice to another student who was, like, uh, developmentally challenged, I believe.  And the mother's very proud of her son for helping.  And another one was, uh, this, uh, woman who's very successful, uh, comes back to visit a teacher that taught her this old man.  I guess it looked like he was retiring, too. 
[03:10:00]  Gives, uh, uh, him a card and stuff.  And he says, wow, you've done very well in life.  What are you, a stockbroker or a lawyer?  And she goes, no, I'm a teacher.  And then Bob Kelly bursts into tears.  What did the cards say?  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  Thanks for wrecking our family photographs.  You genetic disaster.  You.  No.  And then there was this one. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Which was, um, I guess this woman, she's, uh, in her office.  She comes across as a very stuffy, uh, all business kind of woman.  She leaves the office and goes to, I guess it's her brother, her retarded brother's house.  Yes, Jimmy?  Oh, no.  I'm just thinking of another card you give to the retard.  The card, it's, it's a picture of a dumpster in the back of a Planned Parenthood. 
[03:11:00]  And the card says, wish you were here.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, so she goes over to her brother's house, I guess it is, and he's got Down syndrome. 
[03:11:30]  But he's very self-sufficient, and she gives him the card.  It's her interacting with her retarded brother.  Hey, Dave.  Hi, Trish.  Come on in.  Can you show me around?  Sure.  This is my living room.  Great.  And this is my TV.  And down the hall.  That's where I jerk off 23 hours a day. 
[03:12:00]  This is my bedroom.  He talks like Doug out of Doug.  And this is my kitchen.  What are you cooking over there?  I'm making vegetable soup.  That looks good.  Hungry?  I'm always hungry.  Not for your vegetable soup.  Sticky, nasty fingers in there.  Vegetable soup.  It's a bowl with three presents.  For you.  Thanks.  Let me take a look at it. 
[03:12:30]  I'm so proud of you.  Reading the card.  I'm so proud of you, too, Trish.  They had a close-up of his hands as he's opening the card.  Right.  And you would think that they would have told him, hey, clip your nails.  He had these Ricky the intern nails.  They're big and pointy. 
[03:13:00]  And they were on the ends of fingers that looked like, you ever see a gecko?  The lizard?  Like, they got those fat fingers on the little stubby, what's that look like?  His, like, gecko hands.  His hands were all burnt because he wasn't heating up the soup.  He was heating up his own hand.  He was stirring it with his hand.  I call the carrots Bob.  Shut up.  Stupid hallmark cards.  God, they got cards for everything.  Now they got cards for retards. 
[03:13:30]  You just learned to wipe your bottom.  Happy 35th birthday.  Bingo Pants from whackbag.com.  Bingo Pants.  How you doing, guys?  What's up?  I want to see if, since Hallmark produced this thing,  do you think they're now going to have a section of cards for retards?  Like they can get their own parents and anniversary cards in.  Do you guys, thanks for not taking a hanger to me.  Yeah.  Punching out, guys.  Yeah.  That'll be good. 
[03:14:00]  Too late.  And I noticed a couple more clips here that we want to play.  All right.  Let her rip.  Well, Beth wants to have a baby.  Oh, right.  This might be worth playing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She wanted to have a baby because she's in love with her boyfriend, Jesse,  the black retarded guy.  And they are having sex.  But they had a flashback scene where apparently the sister there  and the father were a little leery of this whole thing.  So they had her tubes tied.  And she couldn't have a baby. 
[03:14:30]  And she was very disappointed with that.  Smart parents.  Absolutely.  Smart father and sister.  You should have given her a hysterectomy.  Sorry, go.  It's okay.  I was just going to say they should have given her a hysterectomy.  But I stopped myself short because I didn't have anything else.  And I was actually hoping the clip would play because I was like, yeah.  And then you stopped it.  I'm like, ah.  Could have tagged it with a spade shovel.  Yeah.  There we go.  Oh, Sinead, your baby. 
[03:15:00]  Can I hold her?  Oh, Beth, I don't know.  It's so clean.  Of course you can hold her.  Are you sad?  Ten years since I can't have a baby.  That's what I'm thinking.  Are you sorry now that you can't have a baby?  I don't know.  I don't know the baby.  Leave that baby where I cry all the time.  But I would love it.  That's the most important thing.  We thought we were doing the right thing. 
[03:15:30]  Now look, Beth.  How much did you do with this?  Jesse.  Jesse.  Okay, hold it.  Flashback.  Flashback.  This father asking, how much did you do with this Jesse?  Like they're trying to figure if she's sexually active.  And if she is, they've got to get her tubes tied.  And one of the highlights of the movies are later on in this scene.  I guess it's in the clip as they're wheeling her gurney through the hospital.  She has a few comments to me.  I also have to know, did the camera pan to her legs and the baby legs and you couldn't tell which was which? 
[03:16:00]  Big, fat, dimpled knee.  The thing is, you could get pregnant if you're not careful.  And everyone knows you're not very careful.  I'm sure this Jesse guy is very nice, but do you really want to have a baby?  I might.  Babies are not dolls.  They're not puppies or kittens.  Babies get sick.  They need constant attention.  How would you manage that, Beth?  You can't even hook your own bra. 
[03:16:30]  Do you really want to take that chance?  Do you want to have a baby?  Hook my own bra.  They make them without hooks.  Can't hook her own bra because she's too fat.  Big pig.  It has nothing to do with being retarded.  Then they show her getting her tubes tied. 
[03:17:00]  Do we have that?  I don't know.  What track is that?  I don't think so.  You better have that gurney wheeling down that hallway.  I don't know if we do.  With her comments.  Let me try this.  There's a conversation about getting her tubes tied.  All right.  Let's hear that.  I don't know if this is.  I'm good with kids.  That's why I say it because it's true.  That's right, Beth.  And kids love you.  Yes.  I can't have any kids.  Beth.  That's true.  They have my tubes tied up. 
[03:17:30]  Tied up?  Well, that's okay because then I don't have to worry when I'm with Jesse.  You know what I mean?  Do you like marshmallows?  I love marshmallows.  Me too.  We got something in common.  The kind with the sugar on the top?  I haven't had those.  Yeah, I have them sometimes.  They're holiday.  They make up for holidays.  Hi there, Jesse.  Jesse!  Jesse!  That's a good man!  That's my boyfriend, Jesse! 
[03:18:00]  We know Beth.  So shut up.  What'd he say?  So shut up.  We know Beth.  So shut up.  I don't know, Ann.  I think that's it.  Aw, they're wheeling her down the hospital hallway on the gurney, all ready to get her tubes tied.  And she starts moving around.  She goes, ah, I changed my mind!  I changed my mind!  I changed my mind!  And she's screaming, I changed my mind.  Hey, keep wheeling her right through.  It's ain't your decision to make, stupid.  That's right.  I don't care what the birth certificate says, mind of a six-year-old.  And they clip her anyway. 
[03:18:30]  All right, then it's Beth and Rachel say goodbye, and then Beth back to riding the bus.  Everything's all...  Oh, it ends happy?  All nice.  Yeah, it ends the same way.  It ends, actually, with the clip that we played on Friday.  Oh, okay.  Ew!  We're done with this.  There was nothing to this.  This was a non-movie.  Aside from her walking around sounding like Pee-wee retarded.  Oh, two just...  Imagine her and that black guy just going at it in bed.  But, you know what? 
[03:19:00]  You've got to think, it's probably pretty cool for them.  It's just pure pleasure.  There's nothing rattling around in that head to distract you.  That genital mix, it probably smells like a Reuben.  Oh, God!  Two unwashed fat dopes.  I still haven't talked about Dick Cheney, and the post was so ridiculous yesterday with their coverage.  Do we have the post from yesterday?  Did someone get that? 
[03:19:30]  They wrote the story as Elmer Fudd talking.  Yeah.  You're on newspaper.  My whole take on this, when it happened, and I saw the news reports on it, when we came on and did the show, right after it happened,  I said, they are totally making this sound like it's a lot less serious than it really is.  And now it's coming out that that is absolutely the case.  He's not commenting.  No one, from what I hear, the investigation's done.  This is something that would be, if it was anyone else, this ongoing investigation, there would be a grand jury. 
[03:20:00]  I mean, you fired a shotgun and hit somebody.  Hunting accident.  All right.  It's got to be investigated.  And watch how they use language.  Oh, yeah.  It's done all the time in the media.  All the time.  We talk about how Fox refuses to use certain words.  Yep.  And they'll use something else that's a little softer, not as harsh, like suicide bombers.  What are they called now? 
[03:20:30]  A lot of people will call them homicide bombers.  Homicide bombers.  You know, well, they mess with language all the time on TV.  And with this case, they're saying that this lawyer got peppered.  He got peppered?  He got peppered?  He got sprayed.  Sprayed?  No.  He was shot with a shotgun.  A shotgun blast.  And then he had a little setback.  He had a minor heart attack.  Silent heart attack.  Silent heart attack.  No, there's a pellet that is resting up against this guy's heart. 
[03:21:00]  One of, they say, between 50 and 300 pellets that could be in this guy.  Like, they can't even count how many.  And there's some kind of cover-up going on.  Yeah.  They were trying to make it less than it was.  They took a lot of time between the time it happened to the time that a lot of people were notified.  One of which was the press.  One of which was the president.  The president didn't find out until later.  And he wasn't informed by the vice president.  Which would have been a great call. 
[03:21:30]  How do you make that call?  You're probably throwing in the middle.  It was great.  I mean, we had good weather.  The food was good. 
[03:22:00]  I shot somebody in the face, neck and chest.  We went out for dinner.  I hope he doesn't catch it.  The best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  God almighty, I challenge you to not vomit.  Radio for dummies.  Opie and Anthony.  This is Jim Blassingame, the small business advocate with a small business minute.  Negotiating is a process of communication between two or more parties to reach an agreement on future behavior. 
[03:22:30]  Like when you're purchasing a business, hiring an employee, or trying to bribe a two-year-old into taking one more bite of peas.  Negotiation is a process that takes time and involves multiple steps.  By accepting this reality, you'll set yourself up to be more patient and therefore more effective.  Remember, impatience by one party is the other party's best negotiating leverage.  Remember these things about negotiating.  Know what you want.  Why should the other party negotiate with me? 
[03:23:00]  What are my options?  Don't fall in love with any deal.  Remember, love is for lovers.  This is business.  Write this on a rock.  In business, everything is negotiable.  The question is, are you a capable negotiator?  This is Jim Blassingame, the small business advocate.  I'll see you on the radio or on the Internet at smallbusinessadvocate.com.

[03:26:30]  This shit's pretty good.  And now, the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, we got American Idol audio.  You know, the highlight, though, of last night's show was that thing.  That, that, uh, did you notice when he walked out, they started playing the crying game music?  I was laughing so hard.  That was really funny.  The crying game music was playing in the background.  This supposedly was a guy.  In all fairness, this thing was completely in the middle.  Yeah.  You look at the thing and go, wow, that's a gay guy. 
[03:27:00]  And then you look a little more and go, wow, that's a girl that has, like, manly features.  It was a girl's head.  It was right in the middle.  It was a girl's head on an emaciated boy body wearing high heels.  Built like a girl.  Built like a girl.  It was an emaciated boy's body that he had twisted himself into a girl's body.  And dressed like in girl clothes.  Girl, but then guy clothes, too.  But also guy clothes.  I mean, it was right in the middle. 
[03:27:30]  Well, and his voice was girly.  The hair, the skin, the facial features, all girly.  Well, here's a clip of meeting the thing.  The thing.  Becky, how old are you?  I'm 18.  You're 18.  Where are you from?  From Denver.  I'm supporting our state.  Tell me something interesting about yourself.  The less necessary, is it?  Oh, come on.  Something interesting about me?  Well, I'm a very talented person, and people confuse me for a girl a lot of the times, which 
[03:28:00]  I think is so funny, because I just laugh my butt off all the time.  Are you a girl?  No, I'm a guy.  You are?  I go into the men's restaurant all the time, and the guys look at me like, are we in the  wrong bathroom?  I'm like, no, I'm a guy.  No?  I stand up just like you do.  Wow.  Oh.  It's kind of like paradise again, a little paradise in there.  I stand there just like you do.  I walk into the boys' bathroom a lot of times, and then sometimes guys say, like, what are  you doing?  And I say, because I'm a girl.  I'm a guy.  America ain't ready for that shit. 
[03:28:30]  No.  I don't give a fuck if she sounded like Frank Whitney.  Frank Whitney.  Frank Whitney.  Frank Whitney, Celine, fucking Streisand on it.  You ain't getting on it.  I'm sorry you're not through.  And I am telling you, New York, New York, I will never die.  Tears, everybody, the whole country's crying.  You ain't on this, faggator. 
[03:29:00]  Thingy thing, whatever the fuck you are.  Well, we got it.  Motherfuckers didn't vote for Clay because they thought he was a little fruity.  Yeah.  Well, the next clip is titled, It Sings.  Fucking fan.  So what are you going to sing?  Whitney Houston, Queen of the Night.  Wow.  Okay.  Interesting.  I got the stuff that you want.  I got the thing that you need.  I got more than enough to make a drop to your knees.  Because I'm the queen of the night. 
[03:29:30]  Queen of the night.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  You got a problem with the way that I am.  They say I'm trouble, but I don't give a damn.  Because when I'm bad, I know I'm better.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's not a bad voice, right?  This is what I'm saying.  The voice was as good or as bad as any motherfucker he let through.  He let the little cowboy guy through who's cool.  He said questionable.  He let them. 
[03:30:00]  Kooky guy.  There was the rock guy who they kind of.  Yeah.  No emotion, they said.  You know, and this and that.  But this, and you should have seen him swinging his little sissy hips.  I got this dirty, boy.  And like it was swinging clockwise, counterclockwise.  I got this dirty, and I was loud.  And he was just swinging.  I'm like, all right, go boy.  Yeah.  Go boy, girl.  Go boy, girl.  So it's like he was just, but America ain't ready for that motherfucker. 
[03:30:30]  Hi, what's your name?  Mary J. Bill.  Mary J. Bill Vandross fucking Houston Brown, motherfucker.  I got this stuff.  You're not right for this competition.  All right, here we go.  We got the judges reacting to the performance.  Interesting lyrics in that song.  Simon, what do you think?  Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. 
[03:31:00]  Atrocious.  The singing, Confused?  I think I did awesome.  That's awesome.  I love your self-confidence.  Reality is voice isn't up to par for a competition like this.  Oh, dear, this bitch.  Well, it's definitely different.  It's no Kelly Clarkson or Ruben Stett or anything.  No, I agree with you there.  Yeah.  Yes or no, Paula?  The voice, it said it's not up to par for this kind of competition. 
[03:31:30]  And I'm speaking just the voice alone.  Oh, boy.  They had to keep.  Now, the only one that did not stay on the whole disclaimer that it's just going off the voice is goofy-ass, what's his name?  The English motherfucker.  Yeah.  Simon.  Simon.  Who's like, look, you're confused.  Yeah.  You know, evidently you're a faggot.  We don't like motherfuckers like you on here.  And he, the other ones kept going, just be, you know, the singing now. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your voice isn't up to par.  That nigga moved better than Paula Abdul.  Junkie.  Well, here, it cries.  Yeah.  I think it's totally prejudice to not accept someone because someone's playing girl songs and they don't fit the song in the vocal range of the girl.  I think that's total prejudice.  And I think Simon's a faggot.  And I'm surprised that Paula said I suck. 
[03:32:30]  And Randy was just trying to make it all better.  But, yeah, and America, if they don't accept me for who they are, then, oh, well, I guess they can't handle it.  She shows their own ignorance and stuff and, I don't know.  That is, what a torturous life that must be, dude.  Oh, man.  And I feel sorry for that dude because it's like, he's not gay.  He's a girl.  He's a girl.  Who has a pain.  It's just so sad. 
[03:33:00]  A girl with a penis and no tits.  Just.  That's what you are.  Fucking sad.  And doesn't want to be a girl.  Just a sissy, a third-level sissy.  A third-level sissy.  Just on the highest, highest level on the sissy meter.  It's just like, it's just like, and just to be tortured like that and just want to express himself with woman's songs.  Yeah.  I got to say.  Yeah, singing the woman's songs.  And it's like, you know, guys, it's like how real guys change the lyrics to like men's, you know. 
[03:33:30]  It's raining stuff.  Yeah.  Hallelujah.  It's raining things.  And it's all wet out here.  Tall.  Oh.  It's wet out here.  Rough and tough.  It's wet outside.  It's raining things.  Oh.  You got to change the words to this. 
[03:34:00]  Wow.  It's raining stuff.  Let yourself get absolutely yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's raining.  Oh.  Hallelujah.  Woo.  Ow.  Ow.  Ouch and ooh.  Watch out, motherfuckers.  Yeah.  Roll for Jesus. 
[03:34:30]  He was a bad motherfucker.  Woo.  Oh.  And he had to do what he had to do.  Nothing about, man.  Rearrange the style so that each and every brother can get out there and do.  Woo.  Woo.  Uh.  It's raining stuff. 
[03:35:00]  Oh.  It's raining things.  Uh-huh.  Watch out.  Shit is flying around.  Uh.  The fuck was that?  Some heavy shit flying around.  Watch your shit.  Watch your shit.  Uh.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  This motherfucker was like, queen of the night.  I got the stud that you want. 
[03:35:30]  My pussy's wet as a...  Holy shit.  It's raining stuff.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you, Nathaniel.  Oh.  Nobody.  God damn.  We changed the lyrics, but you know.  I think we got a hit on our hands.  It's raining stuff.  Ah, they're back.  Back with a vengeance.  And what an ass on her.  How's he gonna eat?  How's he gonna have almonds?  You wanna fuck a chicken?  There's a chicken. 
[03:36:00]  Sticking it.  That would be wonderful.  Holy shit.  Whoa, whoa.  Hey, calm down.  He is all about the ass.  The best of the worst of Opie and Anthony must call us for a break.  That made us sound like saggit.  Intern Bill, what's this one about?  This one was just another, like that one, a promo that would go in between breaks.  And this one stars Steve, though. 
[03:36:30]  All right, let's get Steve in here.  We gotta know what every, like who everyone is.  Okay, there's two little kids walking home from school, and the school bully comes up  and offers them drugs.  All right, who's the school bully?  Jacob.  Jacob's the school bully.  Who's Bert?  Little kid one.  Little kid one.  Melissa?  Little kid two.  Little kid two.  And Jacob, again, the bully.  Then Steve is Steve C?  Yes.  And that's the entire cast?  Yeah.  And that raider's also Steve C.  It goes in and out of the coin that raider is Steve C. 
[03:37:00]  Oh.  So many times.  I think Jimmy should be the bully.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I think E-Rock should be the woman.  Of course.  You did such a great job playing the woman.  Is he Melissa?  He'll be Melissa.  He'll be Melissa.  And I'll be Bert.  Anthony should be Bert.  And that's it, I think.  They're junior high school kids.  And they're frolicking home.  Frolicking home.  As this takes place there, Bill.  Would there be some kind of happy, frolicking music that turns ominous?  It's like an 80s anti-drug ad.  All right.  Two junior high school kids frolicking home. 
[03:37:30]  Hey, you want to go to my house after school and play Pokemon?  Hey, what are you kids doing?  Oh, no.  It's Jacob Goldowitz, the local bully.  You kids want to go smoke some pot?  Come on.  Be cool.  Have a toke.  Hey, kids.  Do you know who I am?  Oh, my God.  It's ex-bouncer Steve C., producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  Curses!  I'll get you next time. 
[03:38:00]  Kids.  Kids, you don't need to do drugs to be cool.  Really?  That's right.  Being cool is not something that can be gained by smoking a joint or shooting up heroin.  Oh.  The only way to be cool is through pornography.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, this is some quality smut.  Hey, how old are you?  Twelve.  Here's my card.  Call me in two years.  Well, I guess my job here is done.  I suppose I'll be going. 
[03:38:30]  Will we ever get to see you again?  I shall live in your hearts forever and ever.  Thanks for believing.  Hi, this is Steve C., and I may play a superhero on the Opie and Anthony show,  but I will not always be there to help a kid in trouble.  So remember, parents, pornography is always a safe and healthy deterrent to drugs and alcohol.  What could be more important than a child's health and well-being?  The more you know.  That's wonderful.

The Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:43:30]  Do you kiss on the first date?  Hey.  Yeah, yeah, whatever.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Can I give a quick thank you, by the way, to Doom Warfare?  No!  He sent me Mondo Topless.  I can't wait to watch it.  Thank you, buddy, very much.  I just got it.  That's very cool.  Well, we were talking about hurricanes and scuba diving, 
[03:44:00]  and Bob Kelly was very excited to get in on the conversation  and decided to tell us about his snuba.  He did snuba adventure.  What is snuba?  It's a cross between snorkeling and scuba diving.  I got it.  What is it?  What is it?  How did they make scuba diving faggated?  Snorkeling is cooler than snuba.  Really?  Yes.  I really was trying.  I thought you would.  Well, Obie was like, yeah, they get great diving.  And he's like, yeah, I was 20 feet under the water there. 
[03:44:30]  Wow.  What is it, a big, long snorkel?  My ears hurt.  What is snuba?  Exactly.  What is it?  You have a corksucker.  They give you just like a piece of ball of air, basically.  No, no, no, no.  No, not the big.  They give you a tank.  You get a tank like you.  All right.  Except you don't put it on the back.  All right, maybe it's cooler than I'm thinking of.  They put it on a float up top, and you got a 20-foot cord.  So basically, you wear the belt.  You wear everything except the tank.  Except they don't want you to have the responsibility of having the tank on your back.  Well, you can't go down more than 20 feet. 
[03:45:00]  20 feet under the water is pretty heavy.  It's a lot of pressure.  It's a lot of pressure.  10 feet's enough.  There are monsters under that water.  Monsters.  That's horrific.  Can you see now, or does normally your sundress blow up in your face?  That would be sick.  I went snuggling.  Yeah, did you?  Snuggling.  What's it called?  Snuba.  Sounds like that.  Snuba.  Snuba.  They've got to change the name to make it sound cool.  Aren't those snubes?  They sell it to air?  You know when you're talking to Obey during the break, and he takes out a pen and a piece 
[03:45:30]  of paper.  And starts jotting it down.  Fuck me.  Snuba.  They should give that a cooler name, like blowing someone.  I was 20 feet under, and it's a shipwreck.  It's like a big shipwreck.  It's unbelievable.  It's literally like 60 feet long.  It looks like the Titanic, especially under the water.  The big fish the size of you are coming around.  It's pretty creepy.  Yeah.  And this dumb couple from Cuba, they tap me under 20 feet under. 
[03:46:00]  I'm trying to join myself.  Look, doing the sign language, they give me the camera.  And I start snapping photos.  I look, it's a regular disposable camera.  They just took it under the water.  They thought it was...  These fucking morons.  What do they know, dude?  They probably swam there from their home apartment.  They didn't even know where they were.  They weren't even on the tour.  They just swam in.  They thought you spoke Cuban.  The truck sank, and that's when they ended up in the snow up.  They didn't know.  I saw a moray eel.  Yeah?  I was in Hawaii for my honeymoon, and we were snorkeling. 
[03:46:30]  It was off of Maui, off of the Black Rock right there.  And the guy who was out there with us teaches us, I don't know, he was out there, I don't  know.  And I was snorkeling, and fish all around me, and something big and cold touched me.  I looked down, and it was the largest fucking turtle I've ever seen in my life.  It was bigger than me.  Okay?  And it was all gnarly, and it had shit growing off of it, and it scared the shit out of  me.  There ain't no reason to go under there.  Ugh. 
[03:47:00]  No.  Dude, ugh.  There ain't no reason to go underwater like that.  What the fuck is under there?  You can watch on Discovery.  That's amazing.  Discovery Channel in high definition.  That's all I need, my friend.  It's amazing.  Fuck going down there with those monsters.  When you go down, you know, about 100 feet or so, and you get to like, you know, swim  100 feet.  It's a little.  Yeah, his cord doesn't go that far.  100 feet.  100 feet.  That's going to take that.  That's going to take that.  100 feet.  Your mic stinks today, Gavin.  I noticed that an hour ago.  I was hoping someone was going to fix it.  Well, talk into it.  See if you...  Hello, hello, hello.  That's better. 
[03:47:30]  Maybe you have to be right on top of it.  So now I apologize to the people I just slammed.  Make like you're snooping.  I'm trying to be...  Put it in your mouth.  I'm trying to be...  Yeah, exactly.  But when you're snooping, they actually give you balls to cup.  I actually did...  The mouthpiece is a cock.  Yeah.  And you hold the balls.  And it's actually some Hawaiian instructor holding your head under.  It's in his tub, and they fucking throw like little super goldfish, and you eat them.  Yeah, a little batist.  No, the food, I mean, like the little snack food.  Oh, yeah.  The multicolored goldfish.  I actually did the other one, too, where it's like a little scooter. 
[03:48:00]  Ow!  Oh, you did a little scooter?  It's like a bubble of air over you, like a little submarine.  Yeah.  From your...  Your nipples down is in the water, like in a scooter.  And you just go...  You can ride around.  It's like a little motorcycle.  And you zoom around the bottom, like this little road.  And you follow the fat guy and his wife.  That's pretty wild.  How far down are you?  20 feet.  Oh.  I think 20 feet.  Let me tell you something.  As you're going down, he goes down 100 feet, man.  That's a lot of...  That's a lot of...  Dude, that pressure was killing me at 20. 
[03:48:30]  You gotta know how to equalize, my brother.  Yeah, exactly.  You gotta push it.  Welcome to the world of your feet.  That was very hurtful.  That was very hurtful, but very precise.  Yeah.  Almost like a surgeon on that one.  Wow.  My feet try to blow their nose to release the pressure.  Wait, let's say hi to Chris in North Carolina.  Chris?  Yeah, I just wanted to let Bob Kelly know that, you know, I'm not a historian, but I think 
[03:49:00]  the Titanic was a little bit longer than 60 feet.  Punching out.  The keyword would be like, jackass.  I know that.  I exaggerated to get the fucking point across.  You dumb redneck.  It's not like the Titanic.  And you're like a cunt.  How's that sound?  Dude, it was like the Titanic, the boat.  No, no, the DVD thing.  It was only a couple feet long.  What's wrong with you, Bob?  He's so angry.  I don't know.  He just made me.  I didn't like it.  Fucking.  He made me mad.  I'm sorry.  Bob, why?  Because you said something about my feet, and I took it out on him. 
[03:49:30]  I went home and kicked the dog, Jim.  I was molested!  Thank you for being here.  You were happier.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  What just popped out there?  What just popped out?  Snooba.  I want to go snooba diving.  Let me ask you a question.  When you go down 100 feet, what kind of fish do you?  You must see sharks and stuff down there, right?  I've never seen a shark.  What's a big lift to a fish?  I've seen, like, long barracudas and turtles and I don't know.  How about a nurse shark?  Do you ever see a nurse shark?  Nurse shark.  Those big, worthless sharks. 
[03:50:00]  With the fangs.  They don't really bite you.  But they do nothing.  They can bite you.  They don't even smother the elderly like a good nurse.  They bite a lot of people.  They bite a lot of people, Jim.  Oh, fuck a nurse shark.  I put my dick in its mouth and laugh at it.  You got bitten by a nurse shark, put a fucking gun in your mouth.  The reason they bite a lot of people is because they're real shallow and people step on them and they bite you.  Well, yeah, they're reacting like, hey, your foot's on me.  Right.  That's why they bite a lot of people.  But great white, you don't have to step on for it to fucking bite you.  And it doesn't just lay like a big fat nothing.  Hi, I'm a nurse shark, are you?  I'll fucking, I'll pick it up by its cock and throw it. 
[03:50:30]  The craziest, there's no joke here, but when I started scuba diving in Turks and Caicos,  that was about 60 to 70 feet down, okay, beginner dives more or less, and there's a shelf.  Don't tell me.  And the instructor, like, was really cool, so he let us go over the shelf.  Ah, that scares me.  In a semicircle and then back, you know what I'm saying?  So we go out a little bit, and it was just complete darkness.  It's fucked up.  And then we get back on the boat, he goes, yeah, where I had you guys out, it drops pretty much a mile straight down. 
[03:51:00]  That's so fucked up, man.  Jesus.  I'm glad you didn't tell me, you know, tell me beforehand.  I just thought maybe it was another 100 feet or so.  Even that would be, you know, death.  Do you feel like you're falling, right?  I was sinking into the boat.  No, no, you don't, you kind of like, you don't know which way is up.  Because, you know, you're spinning around and stuff, you fool around with it a little bit.  You have to fall out of bubbles, right?  And you're all equal.  I mean, you're wearing so much belt that you're going.  Well, now the whites are not.  Now the whites are much. 
[03:51:30]  I could have had you, but that was like, that was crazy, yeah.  That's just, that thought of that is retarded.  And you just look out and all you see is just complete darkness and you're wondering what's on the other side of that thing.  I was actually, the middle of the boat was cracked open.  And apparently this big, huge vessel was on the, on the, exactly.  It was just cracked open.  And you, I think when you let your air out, you sink, right? 
[03:52:00]  Something like that.  How do you, when you let your air out, when you breathe out, you'll go down.  I don't know the rules of snoop, I'm sorry.  Well, here's the rule of snooping.  When the cock pops out of your mouth, you're done snooping.  Do you wear a weight belt?  No.  I'm not stepping into that fat joke, Anthony.  You're out of your mind.  You think I'm stupid?  I swear to you it wasn't a fat joke.  There's a fucking bombed Eloise joke coming in.  He's wearing an asteroid belt.  Better get a cruise ship anchor to him. 
[03:52:30]  I was going to ask because I know that the weight belts are used to give you neutral buoyancy with the tanks on your back.  You wear one.  So you wear one.  You wear one.  It's not like a heavy one.  But they actually, he took my weight belt and kept taking weight out of it.  He basically gave me a belt with no weight.  He wound up having to put swimmies on his arms.  He gave me a Chanel belt.  I was going to say, he gave me a belt with styrofoam.  He should have given you a belt of scotch.  That's kind of funny.  Yeah, that was good.  Can I never get a car crash, do you? 
[03:53:00]  Thank you.  Are you kidding me?  I'll give him this one.  Jesus.  I never get a car crash.  They call me Harry Chapin sometimes.  Oh, he bounds immediately.  You saw a barracuda.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw a barracuda when I was snorkeling.  Scary looking.  Man, and they say, oh, they won't bite you, mate.  Don't worry about it.  I don't believe it.  It's bullshit.  I was pretty much freaked out by that.  Barracuda is unbelievable.  You on a fucking pirate ship?  I thought he just said that. 
[03:53:30]  Who told you that?  The bird on your shoulder?  Cocksucker.  They won't bite you, mate.  They won't bite you, mate.  I did that for this tea-sipping jackass next to me.  Did they tell you that?  What are you doing?  Think of them, Mike.  What are you doing?  Scrimshaw?  Jason from Rye on the Instant Feedback.  I love how grown-up Anthony is.  Ope.  This is...  Wait.  Ope.  What's on the other side?  This doesn't make sense, but it says Ope.  What's on the other side?  Ant.  Monsters.  Yeah.  What about it?  Monsters. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  That's all that's down there are monsters.  That's what I keep saying.  No, there...  There's no monsters.  There's monsters down there.  They don't breathe air.  Right.  You're in their environment where the second you don't have your fucking air with you,  you're dead.  Giant squids.  That shit.  What?  There's a king of snuba cord.  Snuba.  Yeah.  Just climb up your snuba cord.  I'm telling you.  That's a lifesaver.  When you got that, you can always look up.  I was sinking in the middle of the boat.  Like I said, I had a big crack.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you just start sinking, and it just goes dark.  What do you do?  Just start jerking the snuba wire? 
[03:54:30]  It goes dark in the boat.  It raises you out of the water.  Look at 20 foot.  You don't go dark.  I was in the...  It doesn't go dark.  It doesn't go dark.  Listen to me, dude.  20 feet down?  I was in the boat.  In the vessel.  I'll be in the vessel.  Look at this bathroom.  He's acting like he's doing some deep sea diving with one of those big red helmets.  I mean, Jacques Cousteau just got out of the Steinbeck novel.  It was dark.  You climbed down the boat right there, and you're on the floor of the ocean.  Twinsy feet.  You see your eyes, you dummy. 
[03:55:00]  Twinsy feet.  I forgot the second.  Sorry.  Stupid guess that open your eyes.  Oh, wait.  You're right.  I did close my eyes.  No, I was in the boat.  They turned the lights off at the aquarium.  You were in fucking Vegas in the MGM just looking at fish in the hallway.  I'm snooping.  Snooping.  I was in...  Let me explain myself a little better to help you guys out.  Maybe you misunderstood.  Apparently, we went down the wrong track, and it might have been my fault. 
[03:55:30]  Oh.  I was in...  There's a big boat.  Okay.  And...  A vessel, yeah.  A vessel, yeah.  A vessel.  And it had a hole in it from one of the explosions.  Well, yeah, going down there for a booty and gold.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Lennie of the blue.  Sorry.  And then, as I sunk into the hole, I like to call it the abyss.  The abyss guy came out.  The abyss.  And it got dark.  David Jones.  It got very dark.  What happened next, old cum beard? 
[03:56:00]  He meant peg leg, and he put the peg right in his asshole and got fucked by it.  That's a long job.  Do you have a bumper sticker now that says, I'd rather be snooping?  Wow.  You don't put it on your car, you put it on your broth bowl.  Your game's over.  Fuck.  Fuck it, homo.  Wow.  You're an adventurer.  Oh, my God.  You're a risk taker, man.  Wow.  Did you also go to Seaside Heights on a safari? 
[03:56:30]  Shit.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Fucking snooper, man.  Oh, I had to fucking slap your face.  I can't wait to see the Photoshop.  It was dark down there.  Plenty dark it was.  Amazing.  Arr.  I fucking, oh, we went out into fucking a mile fucking foot of water.  It was.  I'm in 20 feet.  It was dark.  I'd reach the end of me, snooba line. 
[03:57:00]  Arr.  Go to my blog, snooba.com.  I'll leave the rest of my story.  Two of us went in the water.  Two of us come back out.  You were on the Indianapolis, sir.  I'll never snooba again.  We were floating in the water, cocks all over.  We had to fight theirs to suck them.  It's not a good Robert Shaw, but it wasn't.  It was actually fucking a good bono from U2.  Can you hear a bono from U2?  I'm sorry, bono. 
[03:57:30]  I was thinking I was killed hitting a tree skiing.  Wow.  I'm fucking flustered.  Wow.  I'm never going to cross that one out.  I'm going to cross snooba out of your fucking notebook of death.  Oh, snooba.  That fucking goddamn notebook sucks.  That mean self-esteem has been smashing that fucking notebook.  That's like the fucking, what's that movie with the book?  Snooba equals sucking nuts underwater with balls in ass. 
[03:58:00]  Wow.  Thank you, Jason from Rye.  What were you saying, like the movie with the book?  The Notebook?  What's that?  No, no, no, that movie.  It's not an adventure if you can hear him.  It's not an adventure if you can hear him talking on a boner.  Yeah, that's what that book is.  If you look up and you see two guys on the dock, you're not fucking scooping.  There's no dock.  You're out in the middle of the fucking ocean.  I'll tell you that.  Yeah, you are.  Because the middle of the ocean is 20 feet deep.  It's not 20.  It's 60 feet.  It's 60 feet.  It's 60 feet.  You said 20.  You don't go.  I can only go 20. 
[03:58:30]  You're in a lagoon.  You're in a central park.  I'm telling you right now.  He's in the deep side of the pool, Bob.  That's a bad pool, all right?  He's sitting down to the drain.  He's pissing everything.  You guys can't get him out quick enough.  You're like fucking Barracuda.  I feel like I'm back snoozing again.  Give me that notebook, that Necronomicon.  Whatever the fuck it is.  The only thing that went down was you on the instructor.  I really tried to bond with Ope. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, snooba.  He went, really?  He went like, excuse me, what did you say?  Snooba?  When I heard you say snooba, I just, like, in my head, I went, oh, my God, no.  It's over.  It's over.  And I asked what it was.  20 feet's not even deep enough to get a Kennedy victim out of the water.  Fucking taking deeper dives in fucking Manhattan Clam Chowder. 
[03:59:30]  Stinks, you snoober story.  Big fucking deep sea adventure.  Fucking get a friend with a pool and fuck yourself.  Ah, shit.  It's not an adventure if you could touch the bottom of the pool.  Yeah.  Fucking ass.  I, ah, ah, Jesus Christ.  Stupid Norton's spitting up fucking almond dust.  Oh, it makes me so happy.  I can't believe this is so great.  I'm going to go snoobering again in a couple weeks. 
[04:00:00]  That's great.  Have fun.  How long does it take?  You have to go, you have to get a license to this.  I'm a loser because I, I, I'm not certified.  So every time I go on vacation, I go through the dumb courses again.  How long does that take?  I've gone through the courses three or four times.  Why don't you get your narrowed car?  I'm just an idiot.  How long does it take?  Honestly, to get certified on vacation, you could do it in a week.  Yeah.  But I'll, I'll do a quick refresher course for like, I don't know, like an afternoon and then I'm diving again.  Because I, I talk my way.  Do you learn in the water or no? 
[04:00:30]  It's easy, man.  It's the coolest thing I've ever done in my life.  Can you get certified?  It's scary, dude.  I'll tell you what, man.  You can get certified in pools in Manhattan.  Folks out there, don't ever do that.  Okay?  Get certified before you go in the ocean.  Where do you go?  Where do you go, though?  Huh?  Where do you go?  It's easy.  Well, last year I went to the Cayman Islands.  Yeah.  And then the water is just crystal clear.  Cayman Islands was awesome because you take a boat out, it's not even a half mile offshore,  and it's, and, and those dyes are only 60 or 70 feet, but it's perfect.  That's it.  It's 60, 70.  You run out of cord.  I was 60. 
[04:01:00]  I was 60 feet.  The boat is 60 feet.  You're out, you're 60 feet.  You're 60 feet, though.  No, you can only go 20.  The cord only allows you to go 20.  They don't want you going any deeper than that.  Oh, so you're floating.  You're floating in 60 feet of water.  Oh, I got you.  Here's what you're saying.  Oh, I got you.  It's, it's deep.  It's off the coast.  I mean, it's really deep.  You can't look, you can only look down.  No, you get to go down 20 feet.  So you can literally go sink inside of this, this, this, this wreck.  You can only sink 20 feet.  But it's inside of a vessel. 
[04:01:30]  Is it?  Why don't you do this?  How creepy, how creepy is it just to go 20 feet down, Opie?  Honest to God.  20 feet is nothing.  Like I said.  How creepy is it to go 60 feet down, Opie?  It's not, it's not that bad.  How creepy is it to know that there's things around you?  No.  How creepy is it when you know there's monsters in the closet?  How creepy would it be to see you in swim trunks with a bell on your head?  Ding, ding, ding.  You quickly realize when you scuba dive that just about everything in the water scared you.  Not everything.  Just about. 
[04:02:00]  Well, that's the key.  Just about.  Well, everything I saw.  Here comes that 1, 2% that isn't.  You know.  Dude, a bull shark or a tiger shark is just, not even a great white.  A great white doesn't go near warm water.  I saw reef sharks when I was snorkeling.  It was part of the thing we did.  How big is a reef shark?  They look like, they're, I don't know, 8 feet or so.  A white tip can get up to like 10, 12 feet.  There's somewhere in the Bahamas that you.  Well, this is the problem with the Bahamas.  You go down there. 
[04:02:30]  They don't have rules like America.  Bill Burr and I talked about this.  It's all good.  Everything's all good.  It's all good.  We went snorkeling.  They said you go to three different spots.  And the third spot, you get to see nurse sharks.  And what they do basically is part of this area, they have a, like a.  I don't think Jimmy likes the nurse.  They have a, they have like a bait box.  Yeah.  That they leave on the bottom of the ocean, which is honestly 40, 50 feet down, I guess.  So you're snorkeling on the top of the water.  And you get to see the nurse, the reef sharks come and feed, you know, from the feed box or whatever. 
[04:03:00]  But then they start circling up because they're curious.  And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden the instructor's like, all right, everyone out of the water.  Like, you know, they're taking a chance every time they do this run.  The sharks play, I'm going to bother you.  And then when we all got in the boat, they start throwing chum.  And these things were jumping out of the water and just in a huge feeding frenzy.  And you're thinking, I was just in the water with this crap?  When I was 15, I was in Australia.  And the family, the host family that had us, they had like an 82-foot yacht. 
[04:03:30]  And they would take people out there.  There's an island off of Melbourne.  It's two islands.  One's a penguin sanctuary.  Another one's a seal sanctuary.  What do they hand you when you go to them?  A bat and a video camera?  No, no.  You can't even land at them.  There's no place to land.  It's just two rocks.  But the channel in between has got the most amazing sharks.  These great wikes will breach out of the water to kill a seal.  So you'll just be sitting there, and you'll see a bunch of seals.  And then all of a sudden, one will just take off flying in the air.  They'll just, boom, just be launched out of there. 
[04:04:00]  It makes you real small.  Do you go to the penguin sanctuary?  Wah, wah, wah.  Funk.  Steel toad boots.  Black blood dripping on them.  How's that Buffalo Wayne style?  You're going to have some lamps.  Use your fucking metal boots, have a lamp.  There's plenty of them.  Max from Fairfield.  Taking a golf club.  Max?  Yeah, the water was only 20 feet, but it displaced to 60 as soon as Bob stepped into it.  That was pretty good, Max.  You guys are using water displacement in a joke. 
[04:04:30]  No, you really did.  In the ocean.  Wonderful.  That's ridiculous.  A seal sanctuary?  A fucking penguin sanctuary?  I don't know where I'd want to lay barbed wire first.  Oh, my dick is hard.  Just thinking of all the things I could slap with fat stomachs.  Look at this seal.  Wah, wah.  Whack.  A nice golf club to the belly.  Yeah, I'm not some faggotty environmentalist kid.  These seals get thrown up like 20 feet in the air, dude.  It's amazing.  They just, I mean, these like 400-pound seals just flying. 
[04:05:00]  Just pieces of them just pommeled by a great white.  Phenomenal.  Love the snuba.  Oh, I'd fucking push them into the water if I saw a shark fin.  Wah, wah, wah.  Fucking boot right to the back of its fucking black head.  Bon voyage.  Yeah.  Beat it in the white stomach.  Phenomenal.  God damn.  Anything else you want to share about me?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You have that pen and that notebook near you.  Any other tender moments?  Really?  What the fuck? 
[04:05:30]  I just wanted to be fucking, you know, like Snooba Buddies, Opie.  I wanted to be, I want to, hey, you got stories.  I got a knife.  I bought a knife for my ankle in case something would happen.  Hey.  You know when you meet Snooba Buddies, there's a hole in the wall while you're watching pornographic videos.  Yeah, I need some air.  And he puts his fucking oxygen hose through and then he shoots some air down your throat.  You chew some gum and go home.  Let's go to Corey in Jersey.  Corey.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah. 
[04:06:00]  You were saying you can get certified in a pool in Manhattan.  Not true.  Yeah, because you got to do your open water dive, right?  Yeah, but you can do your, all your training.  You can do all your courses and stuff.  Yeah, pools in Manhattan just teach you how to be raped by wilding teenagers.  You can do the dives in the islands, though.  Yeah, no, I was mistaken.  You can take all the classes and stuff, but you still have to do like an open water dive.  How much does it cost?  You know, it varies.  Like a fancy guy like Opie, you know, he could have whatever schedule he wants.  You know, I used to charge, I taught diving for about 12 years. 
[04:06:30]  And, you know, a fancy man like Opie, I charge him a couple grand and, you know, he's good.  How much do you charge an unfancy fat man that snoopers?  The course, probably 300, 400 bucks.  That's it?  That's it.  So, two grand for Opie and 350 for me?  Well, I...  At least you could do it like a man.  Yeah.  Well, you don't...  Hey, sir, are you a professional?  You're a professional.  Is snoopering, is that...  That's not bad, right?  No, it's Liberace gay.  Yeah, it really is. 
[04:07:00]  You're very, very, very...  Now, how much does a tank cost?  Do you have to buy your own tank?  No, you can...  Or is it like barbecuing?  Do you just go and you return that tank and get a brand full one?  Propane.  How much does a suit cost?  Does it come in double X?  Suit.  You don't need a suit.  Get all kinds of suits.  Yeah, they go up to about a double X and then they stop because I've tried to get...  I've got to get a vest made for me if I want to go.  I taught a guy that weighed over 400 pounds.  Would you teach him to stop eating?  I would.  Apparently not.  All right, Corey, thank you. 
[04:07:30]  What did you do?  Eating the fish like slam?  Yeah.  Was he eating fish like sushi just in the water?  He's chasing squid.  Let's say hi to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hey, Bob, lift up your shirt and show the guys your propeller scar.  Fucking manatee bastard.  Propeller scar.  I like the fucking manatee at the end.  Just in case no one got it.  Just in case nobody got it.  Even though we did get it.  He threw that in.  He threw the ending in.  That was pretty good.  You fucking jackass. 
[04:08:00]  It's the worst.  And we'll be in Anthony.  So the troggs.  Oh, the troggs.  Finally going to get to this audio.  Ties you up with police tape.  Pain in the neck band name, by the way.  The troggs.  The troggs.  I get a wild thing, yes.  That's all we know.  Studio audio from the band.  Engineer was rolling some tape.  They were in the studio and had a little bit of a tiff, I believe.  Band member knows he has a number one, but it needs something. 
[04:08:30]  This is very Spinal Tap-ish.  Before Spinal Tap.  Yeah.  Whether you fucking think so or not, that is a number fucking one.  And if that bastard don't go, then I'll fucking retire.  I fucking do.  I think it is a good song.  I agree.  It is a good song.  But it fucking won't be unless we spend a little bit of fucking thought and imagination  to fucking make it a fucking number one.  Wow.  You've got to put a little bit of fucking fairy dust over the bastard.  You know, like, you know.  Oh, put some fairy dust over it. 
[04:09:00]  I'll piss out of the tape.  I'm a fairy bitch.  Do you know what I mean?  It's, you know.  I don't know what, I don't know what it needs, Den, but I know that it needs.  I know that it needs strings.  It is.  That I do know.  Right.  Right.  And it needs something at the beginning of that number to make somebody remember it.  No, yeah.  That's it.  We could be trying to get some sound out there.  We're trying to get something right.  So what do you suggest we do, Den?  Give it up for the night.  No, not at all. 
[04:09:30]  I don't say give it up.  Baby.  I'll stay here until tomorrow night.  Baby.  I am hooked on this.  He, uh, that is so Spinal Tap, it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  The two guys really yelling, the one guy just kind of chiming in.  That's good.  Well, in this clip, they wonder where, uh, whether or not they need a producer.  You've got to have a fucking blow that says, I've got a fucking sign in here that's fucking great.  Sign in here and I don't fucking listen to it.  And you come in here and it's probably a different fucking tune nearly. 
[04:10:00]  But if it's fucking good, yeah, that's it.  But when we...  But what would you have said if the producer would have been here and he would have left  it exactly as it is, as you've got it now?  What producer would do that?  I don't know.  It might be.  You don't know.  He might say, keep it like that and put whatever else, strings or whatever.  We wouldn't have signed a contract with him in the first place.  Who?  Any producer.  You don't have to sign a contract with him.  Right.  You don't have to sign a contract with a producer to have a record produced. 
[04:10:30]  We'd thank you and good night if we left you the way he is now.  Ah, you see, then you'd argue with him.  Yeah.  But no producer would leave him like that.  You don't know.  No.  No producer would...  You know, he might say we'll put other things on it, we'll overdub, you know, we'll put  strings on it or brass or whatever his idea is on, or a fucking wobble board, I don't  know.  Yeah.  But would you agree to that?  Well, for a fucking start, I don't suppose he'd either say.  Oh, yeah, sure.  But would you agree? 
[04:11:00]  Would you have a producer sit here and say, that's it?  That is what we want.  That is what we need.  Because you can see the way we're going on.  We need a producer to say, no, you're not doing that, you're fucking doing this.  That's what we need.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Nothing's getting done.  Oh, my God.  This is so...  And it's the Trogs, so obviously it means nothing.  Because they, you know, they were known for one song.  Right.  What song?  Wild Thing.  Wild Thing. 
[04:11:30]  You make my heart sing.  Do they ever have another song?  They probably had one.  So they're freaking out at this point.  They're kind of realizing they might be a one-hit wonder.  Yeah.  Get a fucking producer.  You can't play the fucking guitar anymore.  It's your fucking wife, isn't it?  Love this computer magic.  Here's a...  After trying a riff, guitars can't get it the same way.  What you were doing is exactly the same as what you were doing in the original.  Yeah.  Only you were right now.  Yeah, I know. 
[04:12:00]  And you did it.  And you did it.  You could say that all fucking night.  But you won't listen.  We can keep on trying it and then you can get it.  Yeah.  Well, just shut your fucking mouth for five minutes and give me a fucking chance to do it.  Don't keep fucking...  Racking that fucking microphone.  Is it there?  Is it there?  Fuck me, Red.  Just fuck off.  Yeah, but you fucking think.  And just keep going fucking through it.  Don't just keep saying,  I know that's right.  I know that's fucking right.  I can fucking hear a name right, you cunt. 
[04:12:30]  Oh, nice.  Nice use.  You know what?  Nobody says cunt like the fucking Englishman.  They love the word and they know where to use it.  That was perfect cunt usage.  That's silly goose in London.  Yeah.  Don't just keep saying,  I know that's fucking right.  I can fucking hear a name right, you cunt.  Well, fuck me, you say.  You can hear it fucking not right, too. 
[04:13:00]  I fucking can't.  I'm the cunt that's playing it.  So when I can hear a name, you fucking head,  yeah, that's what I've got to fucking do,  then I'll do it.  You big pranny.  You big what?  I don't know, pranny?  Pranny?  Look that up.  What's that mean, pranny?  You big pranny.  I'm guessing fag.  Someone that prances around?  I'm guessing it's a style of riding a horse.  Maybe he meant pranny.  Maybe the guy's a shrimp.  It's a vagina?  Vagina?  Oh, you big poo-ha.  So it's just another form of the C word. 
[04:13:30]  Drummer and rest of the band,  there's the last clip.  I can't agree on what the beat should be.  These guys are a mess.  Well, yeah, you fucking,  you're talking at the back of your fucking ass  because all you want then  is the same fucking thing  that I was playing fucking.  I'm trying to get that fast.  Fucking drums.  I'm trying to get drums.  Well, then all you want then  is the fucking one  and the fucking bass drum  playing the same thing.  You was a drummer.  Yes, you fucking do  because that's all you're fucking doing.  You ain't playing any fucking thing else.  All right, I'll play that.  I'm going...  That's a hit right there. 
[04:14:00]  Yeah.  What's that song?  What song is it?  Da-na-na-na-na-na.  Da-na-na-na-na.  Da-na-na-na-na.  Da-na-na-na-na.  You had a hit right there.  What the fuck was this?  Da-na-na-na-na.  Hey!  Yeah, what song is it?  Every high school band plays, right?  Da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  That's Traffic or our Spencer Davis group?  So glad we made it.  Well, you know what the fucking song is, 
[04:14:30]  you silly cunt.  Bloody Stephen Wynn fucking would.  Give me some lovin'.  Yeah.  Give me, give me some lovin'.  The Trogs also sang Love Is All Around.  That's coming in like crazy  on the Instant Feedback.  How is that one?  How is that going on?  We all know Wild Thing, but...  What we're trying to find out.  Oh, boy.  That's not the Trogs.  Love Is All Around?  You feel it in your fingers and your toes?  No, we're not.  We're just saying that the drum beat,  he had that song.  He had their second hit.  He had it.  Right there.  Their hit was just sitting there.  But they're too angry. 
[04:15:00]  They probably weren't as great as the Beatles,  but they had one angry guy  that fucked it all up.  They're all angry.  What, do you want to write  some faggy fucking song?  He starts playing like  Stairway to Heaven.  I'm trying to write a fucking hit here  with fairy dots.  You're a fucking poofter.  This is fucking bloody awful.  Smoke on the water.  What are you going to do with it?  It's fucking fog.  Should be doing more about wild things.  Not on fucking Stairways to Heaven. 
[04:15:30]  Things that are crazy.  People are saying  you're thinking of my show.  You don't take the Stairway to Heaven.  You fucking float up, you silly cunt.  All right, what's this song?  Years later.  Love Is All Around.  This was the Trogs, their other hit.  This is fucking in Greece.  This is Summer Lovin'.  Summer Lovin'.  I feel it in my fingers.  This is no hit.  I feel it in my tongue.  He's never made it past number 1,400 
[04:16:00]  on the Billboard charts.  Number seven?  This is the song they play  when you're like,  when are they going to play wild things?  Yeah, what the fuck is this?  I feel it in my tongue.  Where's the hook?  Maybe we know the hook.  It's written on the wind.  It's everywhere I go.  It's funny.  Listen to them yell  and then hear this shit.  Yeah, all this.  All right, the hook should be coming out.  I know they had to do this  like a hundred times. 
[04:16:30]  Formula.  What you need is this underneath  with the audio of their argument over it.  You know I love you.  Well, yeah, you fucking  you're talking at the back of your fucking ass  because all you want then  is the same fucking thing  that I was playing fucking  in the middle of the night.  I'll do this fucking  all right, I'll do this fucking thing.  Well, then, all you want then  is the fucking cat one  and the fucking thing  that you're playing the same thing.  What does this you fucking do?  Because that's all you're fucking doing.  You ain't playing any fucking thing else. 
[04:17:00]  All right, I'll play that.  I'll play.  Oh, that's funny.  Very funny.  Goddamn.  Are you kidding?  No, no, no.  I know.  You can say that  and all you fucking do  if you won't listen to me  if you want to.  Yeah, with just such a fucking nonsense. 
[04:17:30]  five minutes  that'll give me a fucking chance  to do it.  Don't keep fucking  rocking through that fucking microphone.  Is it there?  Is it there?  Oh, I love you.  I always need you.  Fuck what?  Yeah, but you fucking think.  Just keep going through it.  Don't just keep saying  I never doubt it like that.  I know that fucking right.  I can fucking hear it  right, you cunt.  Well, look at your face.  You can hear it  fucking not right, too.  I'm fucking crying.  I'm the cunt that's playing it. 
[04:18:00]  So we're not fucking  securing me fucking head.  Yeah, that's what  I've got to fucking do.  Then I'll do it.  You big cranny.  Did he say  I'm the fucking cunt  that's playing it?  Holy shit.  I didn't hear that  the first time around.  Plus he's gritting his teeth.  Oh, he is pissed.  That's terrific.  Yeah, that's great  with the nice little love song.  R.E.M. did a cover of this?  Yeah.  Did they? 
[04:18:30]  I've never heard this song.  I thought they should have.  Never heard this song.  Brother Elmone knows  all about R.E.M.  Do you?  All knowing.  Not really, just somewhat.  Sounds like something  they would do.  Yeah, it was one of the  Unplugs.  It was one of the outtakes  or something.  I haven't.  I don't listen to it.  I invented Unplugged, Robin.  You ever hear the R.E.M. song?  My brother actually  turned it on to me.  Turned it on.  Turned me on to it.  Sorry.  Michael Stipe just singing  the acknowledgements  of an album. 
[04:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  It made it sound like a song.  Really?  Yeah.  The voice of Harold.  He's reading the liner notes  of a spiritual album  from the 60s or something.  And he's just reading it.  He's reading the addresses  of what you write to them.  Taking a big chance.  That's pretty fucking  presumptuous.  But it sounds like  an R.E.M. song  and all he's doing  is reading the thank yous  from an old album.  Yeah, it's called  Voice of Harold.  Yo, what's up?  This is the WWE's John Cena  and you are listening  to the worst  of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:19:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson  with America's Car Show  Tip of the Day  on XM Radio.  Fuel cells are a form  of an energy-efficient engine  that has no moving parts,  emits no exhaust,  and produces water  clean enough to drink  as exhaust.  Fuel cell engines  work by passing electricity  through an electrolyte  and causing  a chemical reaction.  Hydrogen gas  is used to cause  the chemical change  inside the fuel cell. 
[04:20:00]  Electricity is produced  without combustion  and is used to power  the electric motor  of the vehicle.  The fuel cell  has its own fuel supply,  similar to a gas tank,  but storing hydrogen gas.  The processor  extracts hydrogen  from the fuel  and pumps it  into the fuel cell  converting it  directly into  electrical energy.  That electrical energy  is then used  to power an electric motor  which drives the vehicle.  There, fuel cells  made easy.  Got a question?  Check our website  at americascarshow.com.

[04:22:30]  XM 103.  Hi I'm Lisa Ling  with the National  Geographic Channel.  There's always been  competition to build  a better mouse trap  but in Australia  there's a competition  to build a better  toad trap.  As invasive species  or cane toad  has been ravaging  parts of the country  and authorities  are trying to find ways  to get rid of the  millions of pesky  alien invaders.  Inventor Paul Baker  thinks he's come up  with an ingenious solution.  This is my award winning 
[04:23:00]  cane toad trap.  The light attracts insects  which in turn  attract the toads.  The toads jump up  the ramps  and jump at the  light screen  then they fall  into the trap doors.  Once they're in  there's no way out.  Some communities  have awarded prize money  to inventors  of the best traps  or hunters  who bag the most  number of toads.  the species  have no native predators  so the only way  they're going to be  killed off  is if humans  step in  and find a way  to finish them off.

[04:23:30]  Wednesday nights  only on the  National Geographic Channel.  Opie and Anthony  The worst  of Opie and Anthony  Well I got something  to play for you.  Alright.  Because you guys  do have this obsession  with Mike Brady.  Oh.  It's an obsession.  Pretty obsessed  with him.  Maybe.  Sure.  Here's him  describing  the first time  he ever kissed a girl.  Really?  To one of the kids.  Yeah. 
[04:24:00]  From the Brady Munch.  Hi sweetheart.  You like my dress?  Mom,  can I talk to Dad  for a minute?  It's kind of  a father-son thing.  Oh.  Well,  since I don't  really know  where to start.  Uh-huh.  Well,  how about the beginning?  Well,  Dad,  did you ever  kiss a girl  when you were my age?  Yeah.  Wow.  Long pause.  Well,  uh...  Christ's sake,  say something. 
[04:24:30]  Excuse me,  Bobby.  Bobby?  It's a father-son thing,  Dad.  Stop.  Stop.  Come on,  Bobby.  Come up to the bathtub  with me.  Let me smell  your breath.  Long pause.  Uh-huh.  Well,  how about the beginning?  Well,  Dad,  did you ever kiss a girl  when you were my age?  Ah!  Yeah,  I kind of remember  that I did.  Did something special happen? 
[04:25:00]  Sure did.  Her father walked in.  Yeah,  I throw up.  Her father walked in the room.  I found him  much more attractive.  So he's stuck  at my keister  and look at me now,  losing weight rapidly.  It's the story  of a man named Brady  and he's wearing  pants that get looser  by the day...  How about the beginning?  Well, 
[04:25:30]  Dad,  did you ever kiss a girl  when you were my age?  Yeah,  I kind of remember  that I did.  Did something special happen?  Sure did.  Her father walked in.  I mean,  how'd you feel?  Like,  did you see  skyrockets  or something?  Oh,  skyrockets came later.  Right up my ass.  Well,  not skyrockets exactly.  A few little 
[04:26:00]  firecrackers maybe.  Well,  if you did see skyrockets,  would that mean  you're in love?  I mean,  her father had his dick out.  That depends,  I suppose.  It could.  People who are in love  get engaged, right?  It will.  And then they get married.  Well,  I think in your case...  In some states.  It will.  And then they get married.  Well,  I think in your case  I'd recommend  a long engagement.  How long?  About ten years.  love and marriage 
[04:26:30]  and engagements.  It's a wonderful business,  but you want to make  very sure about  those skyrockets.  Make sure.  Thanks, Dad.  I'll keep in touch.  And by the way...  You do that.  Those weren't firecrackers.  They were T-cells exploding.  A little something for you guys  and your obsession  with Mike Brady.  Yeah.  Because of the Mike Brady thing.  We can't stop talking about him.  It's just hilarious.  Oh.

[04:27:30]  Come on down  and see the idiot right here.  Too fucked to begging,  not afraid to care.  What's the matter  with calamity anyway?  Right, get the fuck  out of my face.  Understand I can't feel anything.  It isn't like I want to  sift through the decay.  I feel like a wound,  like I got a fucking gun  against my head.  You live when I'm dead.  People equals shit.
