<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a cynical and irreverent commentary on Nelson Mandela's memorial service, mocking the outpouring of grief, the use of the name "Madiba," and the celebrities attending.  They satirized potential conversations between former Presidents on their flight to South Africa, ridiculed Al Sharpton's televised demeanor, and discussed a "Bill of Rights for Shoppers."  Live audio from Obama's eulogy was interspersed with their jokes. They gleefully reacted to a video of a bystander assault and the subsequent beating of the attacker. Speculation about Air Force One amenities and the former presidents' travel arrangements filled the airwaves. A South African caller offered a contrasting perspective, highlighting Mandela's involvement in terrorism and current racial tensions in his country.  The Super Bowl and their exclusion from Radio Row were also discussed, along with further banter comparing Mandela's popularity to Michael Jordan and the Pope.

The show then shifted to a discussion of "cuddle houses," complete with listener calls and descriptions of their marketing, client interactions (including suggestive on-air images), and pricing.  The hosts debated the appeal to men versus women and speculated on customers' motivations. This segment included brief mentions of Macaulay Culkin and Eddie Murphy's music, the playing of Otis Redding and Black Crowes music (leading to a discussion of musical influences and alleged "ripping off" of Black artists), a news report about a multi-car pileup, and numerous personal anecdotes about awkward or humorous sexual encounters, including cuddling, dry humping, and failed sexual advances. A Japanese co-sleeping shop video was shown, along with a caller promoting a Los Angeles comedy show with potential "snuggling."  The hosts discussed an upcoming company meeting, concerns about a snowstorm, and the show's future under new management. Roland, a guest at a recent party attended by the hosts, was criticized for his behavior, specifically his hoarding of desserts.  E-Rock's return was mentioned, and several callers participated, including Larry from Tennessee, Birdman from Long Island, Tim from Miami, Yurok, Owen, and Pollyanna from Kentucky.

The next segment focused on a party hosted by Eric Nagel, attended by the hosts, Who Kid, and others. Who Kid's offensive arrival, involving sagging pants and racial slurs, was a major talking point.  The party itself was described, detailing the food (and Jimmy's dietary struggles), the presence of multiple women ("bitches"), and an Instagram strategy to enhance its perceived excitement. The lack of regular soda (only diet soda was available), leading to Kenny's complaints, was highlighted. Speculation about the Nagel family's possible Mafia connections ensued. Kenny's refusal to remove his jacket led to humorous explanations.  A promotion of the Patrice O'Neal benefit followed, listing performing comedians.  A tangent about snow days and a Sirius XM memo about employee discretion regarding work led to a conversation with Dennis Falcone.  The increasingly politically correct policies of schools, particularly the banning of gifts for teachers, sparked strong reactions and anecdotes.  The segment concluded with a debate on Christmas songs and a reminiscence of a cat-themed Christmas cassette tape.

A segment featuring a three-minute kitten video wearing Santa hats transitioned into a discussion of the Yule Log, its history, and its CGI-enhanced version.  Dennis Falcone was a guest in studio, discussing his radio work and a planned Vanilla Fudge song.  A previous incident involving an offended (presumably religious) guest and a "double dildo show" was recounted. A story about a man's suicide after a five-hour shoe shopping spree was shared.  A sponsored child with a cleft lip led to a discussion of the corrective surgery. One host apologized for a tweeted photo showing his open fly. Jennifer Garner's crying due to paparazzi, the hosts' experiences with intrusive photographers, and their childhood experiences (burning garbage, mixing cement, plowing fields with bicycles) were discussed. A story about comedian Pete Davidson and Mike Paschetti's navigational difficulties was recounted.  Future show plans, including segments with Macaulay Culkin and Paul Rudd, were mentioned.  Nick Cannon was a guest, discussing his family and career, followed by Mike Bichetti joining the show, with Sam Roberts leading the after-show.

The final segment began with a humorous exchange about shoes and physical challenges. A caller, Will from Pennsylvania, mentioned a trip to Cabrera, near China, prompting speculation about Russia and leading to Mike Bichetti sharing his preferences regarding Russian women and vodka, along with a "friends with benefits" story. A technical issue with a caller's GPS briefly interrupted the broadcast. Another caller requested a reprise of Bichetti's Steven Singer Jewelers commercial, resulting in an improvised and profane advertisement. Bichetti discussed his web series, "Pubby Man," his weight, bullying experiences, past appearance, weight gain, dieting efforts, drinking habits, diet (avoidance of soda), career, fame, fan interactions (including strange gifts and online advances), past awkwardness, and current dating life. The segment concluded with a discussion of the show's Super Bowl appearance, potential for meeting women, dating website suggestions, audience gifts, and the Richie Incognito bullying scandal in the NFL.  The show ended with a clip from an old Archie Bunker television segment on gun control.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  Enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning everyone.  Oh, yeah.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Our special Mediva tribute show.  Well, yeah.  Your Highnesses.  Oh, shit.  Your Excellencies, heads of state and government,  ministers, leaders of education, international education. 
[00:00:30]  We're listening to Dr. Zuma right now.  Wow.  She's wearing that African garb.  Wow.  That looks like a pain in the ass to put on every morning, doesn't it?  Holy shit.  Bet you sweat your ass off of that.  I bet you do.  Her head's all wrapped up and her body.  South Africans must know how to spell by the time they're eight months old.  She's got it with those names.  Look at that name. 
[00:01:00]  That's crazy.  Nikosazana DL.  Yeah.  Who does a DL ever?  Dlaminizuma.  D-L-A-M-I-N.  Throwing a Z.  K.  Freaking Q.  What's going on?  Unbelievable.  So what's going on?  The Madiba thing's happening today.  Everyone's over there in South Africa, in Johannesburg, for the big send-off, I guess.  For Madiba.  Let's say Madiba. 
[00:01:30]  Because then it makes people think you know him a little more.  I know.  They talk about Madiba.  Madiba.  Bill Clinton did that.  He was like, ah.  But he has every right to call him Madiba.  He actually hung out with him a little bit.  Right.  I'm talking about the celebrities that had nothing to do with Nelson Mandela.  They're calling him Madiba.  R-I-P, Madiba.  Madiba.  No one, first of all, no one ever called him Madiba before he died.  I've never even heard Madiba.  What is Madiba?  It was Nelson Mandela. 
[00:02:00]  That's his real name.  His given name?  His tribal name or something.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  He lived to 95, man.  But, yeah.  But, 27 of those years, a little bit on the slow side.  Kind of, you know.  A bit on the slow side.  Not very productive.  Just putting lines on a wall.  Yeah.  There you go.  Let me scrape another line.  6,100.  Right.  Jesus.  But, yeah. 
[00:02:30]  There goes Madiba.  Madiba is.  I've been following kind of the goings-ons.  Uh-huh.  And a bunch of the bigwigs took Air Force One over there.  Yes.  A 19-hour flight.  And they were making a big deal about it.  They're saying the Obamas are on this plane.  The Bushes.  The Bushes and maybe half the Clintons.  The Clintons?  I think, no.  Both Clintons?  Yeah.  Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea.  Because they only showed Hillary's picture on the news when they were talking about the 19-hour flight. 
[00:03:00]  They just showed Bill.  Madiba's funeral.  Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea went over there, too.  Huh?  Four presidents.  Who else?  No.  I'm going to guess Bush Jr., Obama, Clinton, and Carter.  Carter?  Carter, you think, went to him?  They said four.  I don't think they let Carter on the Air Force One.  No?  No.  They said, we'll see you over there.  Man, man, if I...  They left him...  Tag along?  They left him in the parking lots.  Yeah, yeah.  They ditched him.  They ditched Carter.  All the former presidents are like, all right, let's ditch him.  Right. 
[00:03:30]  You like him?  No.  You're a bunch of flat levers.  Right.  You flat left me.  But the news, the news drives me nuts because they're like, well, we found out that, you  know, you got all those presidents on the plane and everyone's wondering what they're doing  on the plane together and how they're socializing.  Well, they went into this lounge area and were sharing stories about Nelson Mandela.  They were not.  On a 19-hour flight, they're just sitting around sharing stories about Nelson Mandela. 
[00:04:00]  And then we looked out the prison window.  Right.  And us, and they're all like looking and attentive, looking at the stories going on.  They might have shared stories for a half an hour, maybe.  And then they probably got right into, wow, this flight stinks.  19 straight hours.  Let me tell you about Madiba.  Me and Madiba.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Tell us a story.  They weren't sharing stories about Madiba.  Jimmy Carter doesn't have any.  No.  He was president from the 76 to 80.  Yeah, he was in prison. 
[00:04:30]  But that's what they released to the press and the press ran with it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were talking about everything else but Nelson Mandela, probably.  So, she sucked your dick right there in the Oval Office?  Yeah, exactly.  Let me tell you.  She sucked my dick right there.  Shut up.  Chelsea and Hillary.  Yeah, yeah.  Pulling Clinton aside to get some details.  Oh, come on.  So, I guess that's all we got on Nelson Mandela.  Big fucking big cock on Madiba. 
[00:05:00]  Let me tell you.  There's a big cock on him.  This Reverend Al Sharpton.  Oh, God.  He's on MSNBC.  Look, whether you like or hate his politics, the one thing we can all agree on is the fact  that he has a stick up his ass every single time he appears on TV.  Yeah.  The guy smirks and grins and growls.  He's got a grimace.  You never see a smile on this fucking guy's face.  He's, he's, he's about a piece of shit.  Uh, uh, and, and this is like, all right, the guy was 95 years old. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  He was at death's door for fucking, at least a year.  Yeah, he hung in there pretty good.  Yeah, and, uh, and people are like, even, even the, the South Africans are, you know, dancing  and celebrating his life and stuff.  It's not like this, oh my God, a young guy died and stuff.  But this fuck can't even, he's got to sit there straight face.  It's me go get the popcorn out and smile.  Well, and, and, and, and you need someone like him to be clear.  I want to keep predicting Stockman and Cornyn, that's your part. 
[00:06:00]  Did you not, did you not see the Democrats?  Yeah, there's no way I could deal with that.  But the fact is, he just does not fucking smile.  No, he's always outraged.  Ever.  There's always some outrage to, to be dealt with.  Oh, there he goes.  Hey, he just did smile.  I don't know why.  Oh, some probably.  Maybe some white person got punched in the head again.  He loves when that happens.  Probably saw some horrific scene on the monitors behind the morning Joe guy.  His newest thing is the Bill of Rights of Shoppers.  That's what he's, Reverend Al's pushing.  What's that? 
[00:06:30]  The Bill of Rights for Shoppers.  Well, you know, the Paul Barney's thing.  Yeah, but he don't have the Jay-Z.  Shop and frisk.  He doesn't like the shop and frisk.  Right.  But stores pretty much have the right to throw anyone out they want.  No, no, I agree, you know, like that.  But you can't, you can't force stores to do anything.  But you could stop shopping there.  It's not a real problem.  It's not.  There's some isolated incidents.  Yes.  Indeed.  But, yeah, it's not. 
[00:07:00]  I mean, we all shop.  I don't see anyone being pulled aside ever.  I've never seen it.  Ever, ever, never.  Actually, not a one.  No.  Not a one.  Holy shit.  Look at that hat she's wearing, too.  Right.  A pain in the ass.  Those are, I don't really like white people hats.  They got there in South Africa.  Where is she?  Oh, she's up there now.  There are past this crap.  I think with his own oppressors, looking past what had been done to him and his people and trying to forge it. 
[00:07:30]  What?  Whatever.  I don't know.  President Obama's going to speak.  We'll take that.  We're going to take that speech live here on the European Anthony Show.  We're going to go live?  Yeah, we're going to take that live, everyone.  That's your Madiba tribute headquarters.  Yeah, make sure the boys know down the hall we're taking it live.  Yes, yes.  Madiba's Christmas, I think.  Right.  I wonder if he's going to come out with.  He's going to share Madiba stories that he shared on Air Force One with the rest of the guys.  Weekend at Madiba's.  What would presidents talk about, do you think?  There's no way they're sitting around talking about Nelson Mandela for 19 hours. 
[00:08:00]  19 fucking hours.  Obviously, they've got to sleep some of that time.  No way.  So they're not even doing it for a couple hours.  What the hell would they talk about?  Yeah, all those presidents.  They've got to go sports, probably.  Yeah, Putin, Korea.  Yeah, just the things they've got.  Yeah, yeah, sports, all this shit.  How's that economy going there?  Oh, fuck you.  Right.  Can't keep blaming it on me, can you?  They're just razzing each other like they're down at the cellar. 
[00:08:30]  Imagine.  They're just goofing on each other.  That's pretty funny.  Anyway.  Yeah, that'll be going on forever.  I didn't realize it was starting already.  It's about 1.20 p.m. in Johannesburg, South Africa.  Are they at that soccer stadium?  Yeah, it looks like a big soccer stadium.  That's where Mandela did that thing that one time.  A lot of dancing going on.  They love.  They love dancing.  Jumping up and down.  It's a weird dance, though.  Yeah, it is. 
[00:09:00]  It's that jump up and down.  They've got to get some hip-hop going into that.  They ought to bring out the Vuvuzelas.  The Vuvuzelas.  Madiba!  Madiba!  Madiba!  Sorry, they flew 19 hours and went right to this ceremony?  Yeah, they don't have time to frolic around.  No, not even a hotel?  That looks like a terrorist fucking dream right there.  Let me tell you.  Well...  You sneak yourself in a bomb belt or a fucking airplane, you know? 
[00:09:30]  You don't even need a jet.  You need some prope...  Although, that airspace has to be fucking loaded...  Oh, yeah.  ...with AWACS and fucking all kinds of shit just to clear the...  There's some shit in the air you think?  ...airspace.  I bet they don't allow anyone even near that fucking stadium.  I think they might have had time to go to a hotel for a fleshing up.  Maybe they do it on Air Force One.  How good are the facilities on Air Force One?  Obama's probably got, like, a little bedroom, but I bet you that there's not a lot of bedrooms. 
[00:10:00]  I bet that fucking thing is loaded.  Loaded with some good shit, right?  Good shit.  How many bedrooms do you think there are?  They probably don't need four dignitary beds.  But I bet you it also depends on, you know, what you're using Air Force One for.  If it's basic Obama stuff, maybe not as many, but if you're getting a whole bunch of, like, dignitaries and presidents and whatnot on there,  I bet you they'd change it up a little bit.  I don't want to...  Why do I get to fold-out couch?  I don't want that.  I fucked my wife in that bed.  Good. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, you're about to sleep in the bed, and then the other three guys would have fucked their wife in the bed around the floor.  Oh, my God.  Gross.  Oh, man.  Yeah, they're dancing around.  That's fucking...  They're celebrating.  They're celebrating his life.  Yeah, with that Lion King-y music.  Man, I don't know.  Look at that.  Ah!  Hey, ah!  Did Medeba make our lives better here in America?  Medeba helped everybody, Opie.  He helped the world? 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  Medeba helped everybody realize that you can be forgiving.  Forgiving, I guess.  Because he forgave the oppressors.  He sure did.  And he took power.  Had nothing to do with the fact that nobody would have supported him if he started lopping off heads and, you know, getting retribution.  Well, in honor of...  Whatever.  In honor of Medeba today, I just want to say I forgive all my haters.  Really?  And I want the haters. 
[00:11:30]  You're going to start unblocking?  I don't block.  You don't block?  I haven't blocked yet.  What?  You're a liar.  I don't block.  Oh, my God.  Blocking's for ferries.  I don't block.  Oh, my God.  What happened to one-way trips to Block Island?  Right.  Oh, that was just all a gag.  You sent a lot of people on that trip.  That was all a gag.  Well.  I accept my haters today.  Damn.  In honor of...  In honor of Medeba?  Medeba.  That is so big of you.  And hopefully they will now accept me. 
[00:12:00]  Let's see how that works out.  Yeah.  Good idea.  You reaching out the olive branch?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Take it.  Take the olive branch and smack you across the face with it.  Fuckers.  Yeah.  See, that guy get beat up for fucking trying to knock that girl out and he fucking punched her?  Great.  How great was that?  A guy in Vegas.  I did not see this.  The knockout game.  Oh.  I didn't see this one.  The knockout game.  He goes to punch this chick and...  And the boyfriend and the girl come over.  Was it some other guy?  Was it her boyfriend or some other guy?  I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  It might have just been some guy.  He kicked him right in the face and then the chick starts punching his fucking head.  You can't see it that well because it's a little shaky.  But this guy gets almost knocked out.  This fucking scumbag.  Yeah.  Good for those people.  Yeah.  There it is.  Of course.  It's World Star Hip Hop.  So it's portrait mode.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Look at him.  Kicks him right in the face.  Bam!  She is really wailing on him.  Oh, she's angry.  Wait, that's the guy in the white who's attempting the knockout game? 
[00:13:00]  Yep.  Yep.  He just hit her.  Oh, that's great.  A little retribution there.  He's bleeding all over the floor.  That guy kicked him in the face so fucking hard.  Oh, yeah.  And she wailed at the walk.  Yeah.  And his friend still put it on World Star Hip Hop.  Yo, gotta do what you gotta do.  Yeah, his friend probably thinks that's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  His nose is bleeding, dude.  And the other people just walked away, right?  That's it.  Hit and run. 
[00:13:30]  Nice.  Wow.  A little fucking, little street justice.  Good.  That's inside, isn't it?  It looks inside almost.  Yeah, it looks like a mall in Vegas.  Wow.  Yeah, he got hurt.  Awesome.  He got hurt.  Oh, that's what should happen.  Good.  People gotta start fucking fighting back.  A gunshot would have been great.  Yeah, that would have been good.  I'm gonna get hurt a gunshot.  Just like fucking pack a pack.  That girl knew how to fucking swing.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  She's not fucking kidding.  She's probably not in a healthy relationship. 
[00:14:00]  I think Obama's about to...  Oh, there he goes.  Here he comes.  We're gonna take this live, right?  Yeah.  Oh, look at that fucking Edie Amin-looking general in the back.  I'd never trust those big, fat, really dark, black generals from Africa with that garb  that they have.  They're never...  You're pretty sure they eat people?  I think they either eat people or just have people put to death for some reason.  For dumb shit, too.  Yeah, for really stupid stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  How do they announce it?  Is it a big ovation?  I think what the president will say is the conversation you're just...  Shut up.  ...eulogizing.  You actually never looked at failure as...  And it was not a time to make a political statement, so you...  He didn't really know that well.  They just met one time.  No matter what happens, you come out with a new skill.  Of some Republicans who've said nice things about Mandela.  And Fox News doesn't even cover him.  They have a cartoonish who did Dilbert.  A Dilbert cartoonish who's on.  They could give a shit.  How insulting is that? 
[00:15:00]  Fox is like, who cares?  Dilbert.  Is that a good one?  Oh, there they go.  Oh, no.  No, it's not.  Dilbert.  All right, now let's go.  The memorial for the late president, Nelson Mandela.  Some criticism for that brief handshake.  Who the hell is this?  We'll read about.  Is that a rapper?  Kanye!  Is that Kanye?  I don't think that's Kanye.  Markable place in history.  Yeah, that's Kanye West.  He's probably some big South African.  Yeah, that's Kanye.  I do not think that's Kanye West.  It sure looks like the Kanye.  I think there's only one similarity between that guy and Kanye. 
[00:15:30]  Look, that's fucking Kanye.  That doesn't look like Kanye right there.  Not Kanye.  He's got some guy holding an umbrella.  He's got his own Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, Kanye does have umbrella guys, so that's definitely him.  That's pretty cool that Kanye got the gig.  Man.  I'm pretty sure it's not him.  It's all work.  No, that's Kanye, man.  Is that guy probably very popular in South Africa?  Because he's got...  Madiba.  You think?  Yeah.  You think he's popular in South Africa?  I think he's well-liked, this guy.  I wonder if that's how he got the gig.  Oh, it doesn't matter in the span of...  Oh, shut up.  When's Obama speaking?  Why do I hear what he's saying, this guy? 
[00:16:00]  Why aren't they letting him fucking...  He's fucking throwing out a tuna.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Here's the printer.  Wow.  Based on race and based on...  Infections are...  Oh, forget it.  Oh, Madiba.  Oh, Madiba.  Oh, good Madiba.  They don't have a sellout over there, by the way.  No?  Yeah, tickets went slow for this thing.  There's some seats available.  A bunch of seats available. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, that's a fucking...  Here about the Super Bowl, there's going to be no...  Opie and Anthony show?  This is called filler.  Filler until Obama speaks.  No Opie and Anthony show at the Super Bowl.  We've already been talked out of it.  Right.  They basically said, oh, you don't want to be at Radio Row.  And then they want us to be at Caroline's or something.  Oh!  Oh!  What?  How about this? 
[00:17:00]  No.  They want us to, like, maybe, you know, do a thing at Caroline's instead.  Well, you can't go 19-1 with Super Bowls.  You've got to be 20-0.  This will make 20-0.  Yeah, 20-0.  And it's perfect, too, because the 20th Super Bowl we're going to be shut out of is the one  in our hotel.  That's right.  Fucking across the river.  We could look out a window right now and we could see the stadium across the Hudson River.  Uh-huh.  Are they saying that there'll be more press in New York City than there will be at...  Oh, you don't want to be part of Radio Row?  No.  No.  We've seen over the years no one really goes to Radio Row. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, there it goes.  Everyone does.  There's Obama.  Obama.  And no tailgating at the Super Bowl.  There's a million minutes of Majiba tribute.  God.  A lot of open seats.  They're cheering for him.  Let's go with CNN.  Try to be a little neutral here.  Thank you so much.  Thank you. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, it sounds like a movie was out.  Thank you.  Where's the feedback?  Oh, that's not Oprah. 
[00:18:30]  It would be funny if you started complaining about hotel accommodations.  To celebrate a life like no other.  To the people of South Africa.  Uh-oh.  Oh, you went for the cheap applause.  Yeah.  That's a Hello Cleveland thing.  I'm going to hand for the ladies.  People of every race and every walk of life. 
[00:19:00]  Yo, my niggas.  Who thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us?  Oh, they shared him?  His struggle was your struggle.  Mein Kampf?  His triumph was your triumph.  Triumph of will?  Your dignity and your hope found expression in his life.  And your freedom, your democracy, is his cherished legacy. 
[00:19:30]  Legacy.  He's doing his black-eyed voice today.  Is his legacy.  His word to eulogize any man.  He is.  He doesn't get the eulogy, does he?  No.  Yes.  He got his eulogy.  And the dates that make a life.  But the essential truth of a person.  Their private joys and sorrows.  The quiet moments and unique qualities that illuminate someone's soul. 
[00:20:00]  They're dancing behind him.  Almost harder to do so for a giant of history.  You think that's bulletproof?  That glass?  Who moved a nation toward justice.  I bet it is.  I bet that's fucking bombproof.  Around the world.  Born during World War I.  Fire from the corridors of power.  A boy raised hurting cattle.  And tutored by the elders of his Dembue tribe.  Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. 
[00:20:30]  Century.  Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement.  Why don't they have Halloween in India?  They have no Gandhi.  How lovely.  Like Dr. Kiss.  It's a good one.  He would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed.  And the moral necessity of racial justice.  It's a big deal when the U.S. president shows up to a country. 
[00:21:00]  I am.  Yeah, we're used to him.  He's fucked up traffic here.  Yes.  When he shows up somewhere else, it's a pretty big deal.  Oh, yeah.  And reached the final days of the Cold War.  Are you going to fucking go through his whole life here?  Jesus.  You get it.  Just look up.  Go to Wikipedia.  Wikipedia.  Say some nice words and get off.  Plug the movie.  Yeah.  Erekt.  He would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations. 
[00:21:30]  A commitment to democracy.  Stupid MSNBC is trying to put a piece together to put in pictures of Mandela next to Obama.  Let's have the moment.  Which we all wish you would have done.  That part in the middle of Nelson Mandela's hand.  Oh, my God.  That is a horrible part.  It's a good one and a half inches wide.  It's a chasm. 
[00:22:00]  Kennedy had a smaller part.  It's tempting, I think, to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon.  Smiling and serene.  Detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men.  But Madiba is so strongly resistant.  Such a lifeless fortune.  There we go.  Oh, he said something they like.  That would work.  I got a big applause.  Nice. 
[00:22:30]  Madiba.  It's a big statement.  Yeah.  He's sharing with us his doubts and his fears.  His milk miscalculations along with his victories.  His penchant for young boys.  I am not a saint, he said.  Unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.  I've read that in a fortune cookie.  It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection.  Because he could be so full of good humor. 
[00:23:00]  Ice cream?  I love good humor.  Despite the heavy burdens that he carried.  It'd be funny if he told a really funny Mandela hotel joke story.  About how he pissed in a balloon and threw it on people.  A son and a husband.  A father and a friend.  And that's why we learn so much from him.  And that's why we can learn from him still.  For nothing he achieved was inevitable.  In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness and persistence and faith. 
[00:23:30]  He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well.  Mandela showed us the power of action, of taking risks on behalf of our ideals.  Perhaps Mandela was right that he inherited a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness from his father. 
[00:24:00]  And we know he shared with millions of black and colored South Africans the anger born of a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments.  A desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people, he said. 
[00:24:30]  But like other early giants in the ANC, the Cisulus and the Tambos.  What? Uh-oh.  Whoa.  He's throwing tribe names out there and shit.  Crazy.  Hey, where are the white women at?  His desire to fight in the organization and platforms and strategies for action so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity. 
[00:25:00]  Moreover, he accepted the consequences.  I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.  My jokes don't go over, I don't care.  I don't care, I don't care.  I don't care, he doesn't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  The idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and equal opportunities. 
[00:25:30]  It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.  Is that so?  Who made you pull for this dump, huh?  For which I am prepared to die.  You can see how a white girl can fall from here.  Mandela's taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas.  The importance of reason and arguments. 
[00:26:00]  The need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you don't agree with.  He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls or extinguished by a sniper's bullet.  You're a liar!  He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate.  You're a goddamn liar!  He used decades of prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the moment. 
[00:26:30]  And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressors, so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his.  Hello, exactly!  Mandela just demonstrated that action, and ideas are not enough.  No matter how ripe, they must also be chiseled in the law and institutions. 
[00:27:00]  Quiet.  He was practical.  Stop it!  Testing his beliefs against the hard surface.  Yeah, you goddamn have!  Stop whining.  On core principles, he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the apartheid regime that prisoners cannot enter into contracts.  Goodness gracious!  But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. 
[00:27:30]  And because he was not only a leader of a movement, but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy.  Uh-huh.  True to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights.  Does anybody remember laughter?  Every South Africa. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit.  There's a word in South Africa.  Oh boy, there's a word here, too.  Oh, that ain't it.  She always thinking something else.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Jimmy Carter.  A world that captures Mandela's greatest gift. 
[00:28:30]  His recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye.  That there's a oneness to humanity.  Where is Hattie?  Hattie to the war's off of Soria.  And caring for those around us.  We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary self.  But we remember the gestures, large and small. 
[00:29:00]  I remember the gestures I used this morning, throwing in my finger raised.  Taking a pitch.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Turning his family's heartbreak into a call to confront HIV AIDS.  HIV AIDS?  That revealed the depths of his empathy.  You are just there.  He not only embodied a room through.  Wow.  He taught millions to find that for themselves. 
[00:29:30]  Her people tend to live in classes.  It took a man like Madiba to free.  Not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well.  To show that you must trust others so that they may trust you.  Uh-huh.  To teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth. 
[00:30:00]  He changed laws, but he also changed hearts.  Aw.  He stinks, and I don't like it.  Oh, Jimmy.  For those he inspired around the globe.  Uh-huh.  But he was passing as readily a time of mourning.  And a time to celebrate.  I thought he said, and finally.  Jesus.  Take him forever.  But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection. 
[00:30:30]  With honesty, regardless of our situation or our circumstance.  He said, we must ask, how well have I applied his lessons in my own life?  Uh-huh.  It's a question I ask myself as a man and as a president.  I've seen cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they were giving the man UPS. 
[00:31:00]  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  That's what happened with Mediva.  Sacrifices of countless people, known and unknown, to see the dawn of a new day.  Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle.  Learn them as a secret.  It's a...  Cluckman.  In America, and in South Africa, and in countries all around the globe, we cannot allow our progress 
[00:31:30]  to cloud the fact that our work is not yet done.  The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality, or universal franchises,  will not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less  important.  Oh, yeah?  For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger and disease. 
[00:32:00]  We still see run-down schools.  We still see young people without prospects for the future.  What's he, campaigning?  Around the world today, men and women are still in prison for their political beliefs,  and are still persecuted for what they look like, and how they worship, and who they love.  That is happening today.  Wow.  It's going after everybody, and we do business with all those nations, don't we?  It means Saudi Arabia and China and shit.  And so, we too...  And he only accepted the gays last year. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  What is he talking about?  We too must...  Changed his tune on that whole thing.  Uh-huh.  There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba's legacy...  Madiba!  ...of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms...  That would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality.  Is that Desmond Tutu?  There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba's struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. 
[00:33:00]  You can't be a hypocrite.  You do business with them.  And there are too many of us, too many of us on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism, when our voices must be heard.  The questions we face today...  Wow.  How to promote equality and justice.  How to uphold freedom and human rights. 
[00:33:30]  Didn't he say finally?  How to end conflict and sanitarium wars.  15 minutes ago.  These things do not have easy answers.  But there were no easy answers in front of that child.  Is Bill Clinton going to say anything?  Born in World War I.  He was like a buddy, right?  He probably can't follow the acting U.S. president, though.  I don't know what the protocol is.  He can follow him.  He's an opener, right?  Yeah.  South Africa shows we can change. 
[00:34:00]  Maybe Clinton's the emcee.  We can bring him up.  Let's hear it for Obama.  Come on, people.  Give him a hand.  Your next ex-president.  Peace and justice and opportunity.  Opportunity.  We will never see.  The likes of Nelson Mandela again.  Aww.  But let me say to the young people of Africa. 
[00:34:30]  And the young people around the world.  You too.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Oh.  No.  Over 30 years ago.  While still a student.  I learned of Nelson Mandela.  Where?  And the struggles.  Student where?  Let's see your transcripts.  Let's see your transcripts.  Beautiful land.  And it stirred something in me.  It stirred something in me.  It woke me up to my responsibilities. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, boy.  To others and to myself.  This is taking forever.  It really is.  It sent me on the wonderful journey that finds me here today.  Yeah.  And while I will always fall short of Madiba's example,  He makes me want to be a better man.  Wow.  I hope that works out.  He speaks to what's best inside us.  After this great liberator has laid to rest. 
[00:35:30]  And when we've returned to our cities and villages.  And rejoined our daily routines.  Let us search for his strength.  Let us search for his largeness of spirit.  Oh, spirit.  Somewhere inside of our cells.  And when the night grows dark.  When injustice weighs heavy on our hearts.  So much injustice.  When our best laid plans seem beyond our reach. 
[00:36:00]  Let us think of Madiba.  Tell what happens.  And the words that brought him comfort within the four walls of his cell.  Get me the fuck out of here.  It's not how straight the gate.  How charged the punishment, the scroll.  I am the master of my fate.  I am the captain of my soul.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in. 
[00:36:30]  And you've got the stock market beach.  But the man that's worthwhile is the man that can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay, Madiba.  Is that it?  Is that it?  Who's that right there?  That's Desmond Tutu.  And puns.  And there's a Clinton and Bush.  And oh my God.  Michelle Obama.  Michelle Obama. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  That's a four U.S. presidents.  I started studying.  President Barack Obama.  Barack Obama.  Are they comforting?  We now move on.  Wow.  The dignitaries all stood and applauded the U.S. president after he finished the crowd.  I thought that was very good.  Throws the mic down like fucking Chris Rock.  He's out of there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The comments from the president.  Ubuntu.  He used a South African word that basically means interconnectedness. 
[00:37:30]  I am me because of you and it's a sense of collectiveness.  Through your tears.  We'll get it up on fall news coming in from Johannesburg.  And by the way, if you want to continue to watch what's going on, we still have to deal  with issues of economic and racial inequality about them and the message of having to carry  forward the legacy.  When he said that word.  Increased risk of death.  And here to explain this, another operation. 
[00:38:00]  Fox is.  They have gone away from that as fast as they could.  They have just moved on to scary secrets where doctors don't want you to know.  Fox is like, oh, fuck yes.  We'll sandwich that between scary secrets and Dilbert and Dilbert and that was the president.  Oh, they're not fronting at all.  Done with this memorial service in Soweto will be following Mandela was elected.  OK, there you go.  I would love to see what the motorcade was to get Carter, Clinton, the Bushes, the Obamas 
[00:38:30]  from the airport.  I bet they spread them out.  Do you think?  I bet they spread them out.  Yeah.  Oh, the Obamas is the big one.  But then again, can you get more safe?  If you have everybody in one motorcade, you only have to protect one motorcade.  Well, that's true.  Then Clinton's telling everyone he used to be, you know, the main guy in the main motorcade  as he's in a dumb work van somewhere.  Oh, God.  They get their own little Secret Service guys, though.  Not much.  Not as impressive.  Do you want to be in the ex-president Secret Service group or the fucking current one with 
[00:39:00]  all...  That's true.  No, they're probably all like, you got an extra seat in the car?  Right.  They might have...  I don't know.  They might have put them together.  Yeah.  They probably did.  Yeah, at least in the same motorcade.  I mean, you know...  All in the fucking limo and...  Is Carter that important these days?  Carter's sticking his head up out of the sunroof, waving his arms around, like big.  I've been in two restaurants this week and seen people I thought were Jimmy Carter.  I swear to God.  You are the worst.  But you know what told me it wasn't him?  I'm like, nobody else was looking at him. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  He's the ex-president.  But twice you saw this?  Yeah, it was humiliating.  I'm embarrassed to even admit that to me, much less all of you.  I love it.  He doesn't have Secret Service, though.  Jimmy Carter?  Jimmy Carter.  He has to have a security guard.  He has to...  No, he totally blew it off.  He said, I don't want it.  But he might pay for his own security.  He might...  Nixon paid for his own security.  He might.  He's got to have somebody.  I don't know.  Yeah, you can't because...  He's got to have somebody.  The risk to...  It is a national security risk to not have security.  Because if you're kidnapped...  Yeah?  Yeah.  Isn't it not your choice or something, too? 
[00:40:00]  I don't know.  They give you a little something?  I heard it's one guy.  He's got one guy.  He has to have somebody.  He's got to have, like, a club sort of candy.  I heard he said, go fuck your mother when it comes to the fucking Secret Service.  Yes.  Damn.  Exact quote.  That's rough.  He pays for somebody, then.  And they say Nixon paid for his own because...  It's a guy in a peanut suit.  It's a peanut...  The peanut man.  Because if these guys are kidnapped for political reasons, you can threaten the U.S. president  with an ex-U.S. president...  It's just...  And what character would have to go get him? 
[00:40:30]  Get him back?  One of your action movie guys?  Probably, yeah.  Dirk McGinowitz?  Yeah.  Wits?  Dirk McGinowitz is the newest one.  That's a Jewish action hero.  They're getting Obama right out of there.  They're whisking him out?  It looks like it.  He's walking.  Where?  Yeah, they probably...  They just showed him walking out.  Sitting in there.  Yeah, I think he's done.  It's a threat.  Back on a plane.  You think the guy speaking two people after Obama was like, I hope he sticks around.  Maybe he'll like what I have to say.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He'll hear what I... 
[00:41:00]  Oh, he's getting the fuck out of there.  Let me say hi to Mike in Connecticut.  Mike?  Kevlar umbrella.  I watched the fucking...  Listened to the fucking news all morning.  That speech was the fucking most boring piece of shit I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You don't think that was a good speech, though?  Even if you don't like Obama, you didn't think that was at least some great moments in that?  No.  My point is, I'm listening to you guys in the morning, and I've got to listen to a fucking  speech that I would never have listened to on TV.  But that's why I always have something else I also like listening to. 
[00:41:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Just in case.  Just in case.  You go, okay, they're not happening today, so I'm going to go to my second favorite thing  to listen to.  Instead of just sitting there getting annoyed.  I wouldn't completely depend on us.  That's fucking ridiculous.  Yeah.  We're going to let you down, sir.  That's ridiculous.  Fucking Mike.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  I'm like, why are they claiming speech?  Well, it's a big deal, this Medeva.  Yeah.  And then you've got Obama over there.  I think you've got to do it.  I don't know.  It's a huge piece of news. 
[00:42:00]  I don't think it's going to make a best of it or anything, but it's part of history.  Some of the audio was from us.  It was some of the sound clips you heard.  Right.  There you go.  There was a couple of chuckle.  There might have been a couple lofts in there.  Just a couple.  A little chuckle.  Yeah.  A little spice.  His whole delivery is like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I didn't.  See, that would have been funny if we did that.  Yeah.  I didn't mind the Obama speech.  It was all right.  It was interesting.  I didn't give a shit.  Yeah.  He never changed his cadence in his voice.  It's all.  Well, I think it's all bullshit. 
[00:42:30]  I think Anthony in there kind of pointed out the fact that we do business with these terrible  people that Obama's saying.  Oh, and we must look at injustice.  Right.  Oh, really?  And fucking give them money so they could continue being unjust.  Sure.  Unjust.  Injust.  Injustices.  All right, Mike.  I'm sorry about that.  Love you guys.  We got dick jokes right around the corner.  I promise you.  Some things we have to play, Mike.  I mean, it's, you know, the president eulogizing.  Probably the biggest.  Who's a bigger dignitary, aside from maybe the Pope, than fucking Mandela? 
[00:43:00]  He's pretty much the biggest celebrity in the world.  Right?  Is there a bigger one?  I don't think so.  We just did this.  Or we tried to come up with someone that was more popular than Mandela that was living.  I don't know.  Or who can have a bigger funeral?  I don't think you can give it to the Pope because he's a new Pope.  Yeah, he has a new Pope.  Yeah, but he's new Pope.  He's also the Pope.  And the office of Pope is too, it's too big an office.  Like, everyone would go to that just because you can't piss the Catholics off.  I think an ex-president, you know.  You get fucking, you don't think if Bill Clinton passed away, that that wouldn't be a giant fucking... 
[00:43:30]  They're not going to have it at a soccer stadium.  Sorry.  No, they wouldn't.  But that's a South African thing, you know.  He's like an ice rink guy.  Yeah?  They'll fill up an ice rink.  Not the NASA Coliseum, though.  One that has the screens on the ice.  They'll roll out the smoke machines for Bill Clinton.  Right, right.  They should be ashamed of themselves at the mausoleum.  Yeah.  The NASA mausoleum.  Steve Summers said that, right? 
[00:44:00]  Was it?  That was a Steve Summers thing.  Yeah.  Calling it the mausoleum.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  He has a great point about what we just heard.  Steve, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  I was just wondering, is it just me, or does Obama sound exactly like The Rock doing a  wrestling promo?  I got to tell you, I've never...  No!  A little rockish.  I've never heard that one before.  That he sounds like The Rock.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I think that's racist.  We'll have to look into it.  Could be racist, what this guy just said.  All right, Steve. 
[00:44:30]  That was a good point.  Man, great.  Then we got a South African checking in.  Oh.  This guy, Mark, originally from South Africa.  Mark?  Yes, good morning.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Wow, that's a wacky little accent.  I like it.  Big fan, big fan.  Thanks for coming.  Oh.  Where are you from?  Where are you calling from?  Florida.  Florida.  South, uh...  Originally from South Africa, living in Florida.  Yes, yes, yes.  So, listen, um...  You like the South, I guess.  Whenever somebody brings this up in casual conversation and you have anything bad to say about Mandela... 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  ...the world thinks you're a racist.  Right.  I don't know if people know that he pled guilty on 150-plus counts of terrorism and sabotage.  Oh, my goodness.  He didn't go to prison because he was anti-apartheid.  So, with this whole Boston bombing thing, Obama came out and said, you know what?  Anybody who uses bombs to kill innocent people is a terrorist. 
[00:45:30]  Now they're up there seeing his praise.  It's unbelievable that he talked to see that South Africa.  But do you not see the difference between the American system and what was happening in that time in South Africa with apartheid?  Yes, but if you take that exact same time, and you know, I'm not going to pretend like I knew all of this.  I read up a lot on it.  If you take that exact same time in the 60s, whether it was in the UK or in the United States, he would have gotten the death penalty. 
[00:46:00]  Amnesty International actually did not want to take his case because they said he's not a political prisoner, nor did he get an unfair trial.  He should have gotten the death penalty, but South Africa said, you know what?  We're not going to do it.  So, now, you know, the guy obviously went to prison for a very long time and all of that, and he came out and the country changed.  And things are much, much better right now in terms of racial equality.  However, it's the exact opposite right now. 
[00:46:30]  That's the reason why I left South Africa.  White people are getting killed like crazy.  It's insane.  So, yes, he did good things, and he had a lot of forgiveness when he came out, but people don't know why he went to prison.  All they see is this martyr, you know, and if you look at how they accomplished what they did, it's mind-blowing.  They blew up buildings and railways and sabotaged military, you know, where, if you take somebody like MLK, who did things through peace and sanctions and sit-outs and stuff. 
[00:47:00]  Mandela was arrested right before he was going to be involved in a bombing of young children.  What?  Yes, and he was arrested, and that's the only thing, and he said, he, like, thanks God that he got arrested at that point, because he did not want, like, looking back, he didn't want to be part of that. 
[00:47:30]  Killing innocent people, yeah.  But at the time, he was ready and raring to go to, you know, wipe out some kids there with a bomb.  Fucked up.  He pled guilty.  Remember, he was trained as a lawyer.  You know, he got his military training a lot from Russia.  You know, if you look at who he likes to hang out with, Fidel, what was his name from Fidel?  Che Guevara.  Right, yeah.  He likes the commies, yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Or people that have seen as revolutionaries.  Right, revolutionaries, commies.  So, it wasn't purely, you know, a thing to be able to vote and all the qualities.  The means that they did it through is mind-blowing, and now everybody's praising him.  Well, maybe because it's seen as effective in the long run.  I'm guessing...  The end justifies the means?  In a lot of ways, it does, sure.  I mean, American history proves that the end justifies the means.  I mean, our coming of age was barbaric.  Every country's coming of age is barbaric. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, I mean, you can't overthrow a horrible, repressive government politely.  So, if you feel that you're being unjustly treated here in the United States, you sanction what?  No, because I think most rational people can see the difference between the way the United States is working and the way apartheid was working.  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  All right.  If you take folks like what's happening in the Middle East, right, and there are some horrible things happening over there, that's the same mindset. 
[00:49:00]  They feel that through violence, through roadside bombings, and through killing Americans...  That's true.  They can justify the means to say, we are right.  We will kill you because we think that the end people will give in.  America will leave because we've killed enough of them.  Terrorist attacks of you.  We wouldn't treat them as heroes.  That's true.  That's true.  The fucking 9-11 fucking bombers, the pilots and stuff? 
[00:49:30]  We wouldn't treat them as fucking heroes.  Because a guy going overseas and attacking civilians on purpose is a lot different to me, with a religious motive, is a lot different to me than somebody fighting for something...  To you.  To me, yeah, of course.  They feel just as strongly about their cause.  They do.  Yeah, if the one guy's fighting for a race, the other one's fighting for religion, one may go blow up a building because of gay rights or whatever. 
[00:50:00]  I fight for my right to party, is what I do.  We should shut down this funeral immediately, is what I'm thinking.  Yeah, just throw everybody out of that stadium.  Mark's making some good points here.  Well, terrorists and a freedom fighter, I guess it all depends on what side of the street you stand on with anything.  Right, of course.  The U.S. are imperialist pigs, or we're freedom givers, depending on what country you ask.  I mean, I see the government of the United States being pretty oppressive of late, you know, with the horrid taxes and regulations on everything, the inability to exercise many of our rights. 
[00:50:30]  I see that as oppressive.  What are you, bombings are the answer?  I don't think so.  But some people would agree, you know, you look at Waco and Ruby Ridge and things like that, those people are looked at as lunatics.  Meanwhile, all they were doing is fighting the government the same way, you know, people that look at Madiba would look at him as a hero. 
[00:51:00]  They feel they don't have a voice, they use a boss.  Yeah, but not one of the United States is being treated the way apartheid South Africans are being treated.  It's a different system.  South Africa accent's a complete ripoff of Australia a little bit.  That's what I'm getting out of this discussion.  And, Jimmy, just one last thing.  The interesting thing is that South Africa gave it a name.  You know, if you look at other countries, including here in the United States, what happened in the White House, the Pentagon and everything, there was unbelievable racism. 
[00:51:30]  You still hear about white folks here in the South dragging people around behind trucks and crazy things like that.  South Africa just gave it a name.  That racism and segregation has been around the world between Chinese and Japanese.  Yeah, of course.  I think it was such a big deal in South Africa because it was the minority that had power over the majority.  They were smart.  The people didn't like that.  Well, yeah, regardless of the cause and reason and everything, you know, you could go into that. 
[00:52:00]  But when you have a minority exercising power over the majority, people get a little fucking angry.  But all things considered, man, I tell you, the United States is an amazing place.  We have a lot of issues and hiccups and things to complain about.  But living in this country is an amazing privilege.  And if you, Anthony, listening to you, it's the American dream.  If you want to be successful here, you absolutely can in a very honest way. 
[00:52:30]  Look at you.  It's an amazing country.  You sound like a real commie to me.  It's the voice of somebody from another land.  See, he doesn't take it for granted like many Americans do.  The selfish, fat Americans.  Thank you, sir.  Good job, Mark.  Thank God.  Some intelligence there.  Thank you.  Mark originally from South Africa.  Silly accent.  This guy has info on the president's motorcade. 
[00:53:00]  How do you have info on this, Nick?  Really?  They were talking about it on, I think, MSNBC, how all the presidents, what they did was they flew to meet Obama.  And when Obama leaves, he always takes two planes.  There's two Air Force One, Air Force Two.  So the rest of them rode, I guess, on the second plane and just came over with the president.  And then the motorcade, they actually had two beasts, the Cadillac limousine that they had.  So they had the president and some people in one, and then the rest of everybody in number two. 
[00:53:30]  But they all came in one big motorcade.  Number two.  But they also told us they all flew together.  Yeah.  And we're having small talk and sharing stories about Nelson Mandela.  Well, I think some people did go on the plane.  Judd Hirsch was in there.  Mike David!  I heard it was the Obamas.  I heard it was the Bushes.  And I heard it was just Hillary.  But they're saying it was Bill as well.  Oh, yeah.  I saw Bill.  Bill had to be there.  No, he's there.  But did he go on another plane for whatever reason?  Yeah, maybe they only have a certain amount of VIP spots or something. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, so they all wanted to get...  Or maybe Bill had something else going on and said, look, I'll meet you over there.  Oh.  I don't know.  Taking the fucking Playboy Learjet over there.  All right, Nick.  Thank you.  No, he wouldn't do that.  Oh, okay, Lady Di.  Oh, he wouldn't do that.  Oh, no.  He wouldn't do that.  Let's have Lady Di on the show today and her thoughts on Madiba.  Oh, God.  And Bobo.  I think Bobo needs to give his thoughts on Madiba today. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, sure.  Gene in Connecticut.  Morning.  You want to talk about Mandela after he came out of prison?  Yes.  I'm not talking about wrestling this time.  But anyway, when Mandela did come out of prison, you want to...  I would mean we remember him talking about wrestling.  Yeah.  Oh, I remember that.  Gene from Connecticut.  I remember Gene.  No, you don't.  I do.  No, you don't.  We asked you if they called you Mean Gene.  Or Gene Gene the Dancing Machine.  Yes.  The Dancing Machine.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  You're that guy.  Okay.  Funny little note about Gene Gene the Dancing Machine from the gong show. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Lost both of his legs to diabetes.  You just fucking talk.  You just fucking babble over me.  You know what?  Go ahead, Gene.  What?  Well, basically, we understand that Mandela was a Marxist.  Cool.  Right to it.  He was the leader of the African National Congress, which did engage in terrorist acts on official  buildings, which killed not only whites, but black.  And this is why he went to prison.  A lot of people think that he went to prison because he just opposed the part.  Right.  Right.  Cool.  Last caller just said that.  Good point.  Right. 
[00:55:30]  Absolutely.  Right.  Right.  So what are you going to add to this?  Mean Gene.  I had a bubble in my throat.  It was a funny.  I should talk like this.  You get some out of prison with two ideology about.  Jesus.  Unceremoniously hung up on.  I love it.  People are trying to figure out the celebrity thing.  This guy, Joe Hoff, 23, says, Jordan greater than Mandela.  Mandela greater than the Pope.  Jordan greater than the Pope greater than Obama. 
[00:56:00]  That's his list.  Oh, the guy's an asshole.  Jordan?  Michael Jordan?  This guy, where's he from?  Chicago?  Yeah, it's got to be.  Jordan was pretty fucking famous.  If Jordan died tomorrow, there would not be this type of outpouring.  No fuck way.  Not even close.  Muhammad Ali, you'd have to put on that list.  But not like that.  Ali would not like that.  He would have an amazing.  You need an ex-president.  Yeah.  That was like, you know.  Well, we don't have one of those. 
[00:56:30]  Like Clinton.  Clinton.  If Clinton passed away.  Out of all the presidents still living, yes, Clinton is.  Yeah, Clinton's like the one that everyone likes.  That shit goes.  Fun guy.  Because Mandela wasn't really hated anywhere in the world.  Like Bush was hated in too many places.  Yeah.  Whereas Mandela was kind of respected by most groups.  Yeah, there'd be celebrations in places if George W.  Right.  Died.  There'd be celebrations.  But Mandela, there's no one celebrating.  No.  That he's dead.  He's just kind of like, you know.  There's all this outpouring.  I don't think you'd find that anywhere else. 
[00:57:00]  I think, yeah.  Because again, a pope is such a religious difference.  Yeah.  Although I still say he's a bigger, just because he leads a billion Catholics.  Is it a billion?  I think so, yeah.  Am I wrong about that?  Maybe.  I think it is.  I don't know if it's a billion.  A lot of billion?  Fucking.  That's a lot.  A lot of fucking people.  Yeah.  He calls all of them every day.  It's really a shitty schedule.  Damn it.  He must get up early.  Wow.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll get back into the Super Bowl nonsense.  Going to get into that story of the guy that couldn't take his wife or girlfriend shopping 
[00:57:30]  anymore.  Fantastic.  That everyone was tweeting about last night.  What a symbol of everybody.  Macaulay Culkin is back in the news.  Good or bad?  That's a loaded question.  It depends.  All right.  He's doing some musical thing.  Okay.  So is Eddie Murphy, by the way.  Yeah?  We got that?  What is he doing?  I saw a music video last night.  Eddie Murphy was fucking playing guitar and singing with a band.  Oh, let's hear that to the break.  Yes.  Also some kind of cuddle house. 
[00:58:00]  Do you know about these cuddle houses?  I heard about a cuddle house.  I want to go.  I've heard about cuddle houses.  Yeah.  Where you just go to like some weird place and you just kind of hug people and cuddle  with them.  How fucking needy are people?  But there's no like, there's no sex or anything.  It's just.  It's just cuddling?  You just kind of cuddle with strangers.  I like to load up on Viagra and go there and just be the fucking creeper.  The guy with the rod that nobody wants to hug.  Just pre all over the place.  Let's use our audience today. 
[00:58:30]  If you know about cuddle houses, please call the show if you've ever done this.  It seems really, really strange.  Why would you do that if there were, you know, no sex involved?  Right?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Some people are very needy.  Maybe Paul Rudd stoned.  We'll see.  Paul Rudd.  So if you guys behave today, we'll give you the Paul Rudd stoned.  Oh, by the way, there's a picture here.  Brett and the audience.  I like it.  Somebody put in a picture of Jimmy Carter.  Yeah.  Shaking hands like over a fence or something. 
[00:59:00]  Like you can see he's got the hat on and he's just helping people.  And the guy goes to Secret Service right next to me when I took this.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's no way Carter's going to do that.  I thought that was bullshit.  It's not very secret.  He's probably the most accessible.  Like he's a guy you could probably approach.  For humanity, he goes and swings a fucking hammer with a bunch of fucking people building houses.  He's a good guy, Jimmy Carter.  Yeah, he really is a, you know, a do-gooder.  Humanitarian.  Sure.  You're the water walker.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:59:30]  Continues in moments.  Continues in moments.  It's the return of E-Rock, everyone.  Oh, yeah.  What's up, Eric?  Hello.  Why are we playing this?  Otis Redding.  Oh.  Oh, yeah?  God, 46 years ago, in a plane crash.  Is that why you needed a day of leisure yesterday to do it? 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  A lot of breathing.  Oh, he covered the black crows, I guess, huh?  Yeah, he's ripping off the black crows.  No, wait, guys.  This is the console.  Oh, Lady Jim.  Black Crows made this one way better.  I didn't realize this was...  Did Otis Redding do this originally?  I don't know.  Yes.  Black Crows really pumped it up.  Again, ripping off the black man. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  Bam, bam, bam.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Big fan of the black crows right here.  This little...  There's a good rap to that, too.  By Big Daddy Kane and the Marley Mall crew.  Whoa.  And that's the ace.  Yeah?  Hey, Otis Redding. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, Otis Redding.  Hey, Otis Redding fell short of the 27 Club.  He was 26.  Oh, wow.  Otis Redding was only 26.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that until I just fucking read it.  Wow.  That seems strange.  Right?  Right.  He had a pretty good career going.  Really?  All right.  You guys want to talk about...  I'm the dock of the bay.  ...cuddle houses?  What is that? 
[01:01:30]  I don't know.  I've heard them.  I've heard about them.  I heard it on the news this morning, and they said that...  They're shutting one down?  They shut them down.  Why are they shutting them down?  Well, because they think they're houses of ill repute.  But they swear there's no sex involved.  You just go there if you're lonely.  I'm lonely.  And you cuddle with someone else that's lonely.  Is that what it is?  They don't have people there?  They have people there.  They have people there.  Okay.  Yeah, it's like you pick your lady or guy, like a brothel, who you want to cuddle with.  I've heard it could be just a whole bunch of strangers, though. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, that's nice.  But then you know it's just a bunch of dudes showing up.  Want to cuddle?  All right.  That's why that never works out.  No.  The women don't see it the same way.  No fucking way.  All the dudes are like, yeah, that sounds like a cool little thing.  Yeah.  But you're not going to get the women showing up.  You got the news story?  Yeah.  So I guess you've got to have some professionals in there.  Right.  To keep the cuddle business going.  That's the service they provide.  A lady to cuddle with in Madison, Wisconsin. 
[01:02:30]  So it was an excuse to have some sex going on without getting caught.  No sex.  By the authorities.  No sex.  Just weirdos who like to cuddle.  So why are they shutting it down, then?  That's true.  Why?  Because they think.  They don't get it.  Oh, they think sex is happening.  But they're swearing at the cuddle house there's no sex going on.  Is there money in exchange?  Because even if there was sex, whose fucking business is that?  Yeah, there's money in exchange.  Okay.  It's a service.  You see this fucking thing?  Wow, that's some accidents happening.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Where was that? 
[01:03:00]  Northeast.  People just flying into this big pileup.  Pileup.  Where's Germantown?  Oh, Germantown is in Philly, right?  It's got to be in Pennsylvania.  Look at these fucking cars.  It's got to be in Pennsylvania.  Wow.  Look at the sliding.  Oh, that's got to suck.  You see it too late and you jam on your brakes and you're just sideways.  How scary is it when you touch the brakes and you slow down by three miles an hour and you know that you're hitting the car?  It's the worst.  That takes place.  That would happen in Wisconsin as well.  What? 
[01:03:30]  As of this story.  That's Germantown.  Wisconsin, it just said.  Oh.  Oh.  Well.  There's more than one Germantown.  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  Let's hear the cuddle story out of Wisconsin.  Story you'll only see on news screen.  Oh, of course.  Of course.  Hi.  I'm Snuggle.  There's nothing new with wanting a little snuggle time.  Let's make the world a softer place.  Let's snuggle.  Yes.  The old rug.  But that something old.  Jesus.  There it is. 
[01:04:00]  It's getting renewed.  Here.  No, it's going to be wild.  At the Snuggle House.  Even just a hug for a couple seconds can release the oxytocin in your body and your brain.  Shut up.  Which has powerful effects to reduce stress.  They're lazy escorts, I think.  Yeah.  That is, like, such a good idea.  Yeah.  We would go right into cuddling, like, spooning on a bed.  It sounds, like, kind of crazy.  But because it sounds crazy, I think, because it's two strangers.  It's two people that don't know each other. 
[01:04:30]  And in our culture, that is so, like, that doesn't happen.  No.  And that's people I don't like.  I don't want to fuck after that.  Whenever you like, we can change positions.  Just let me know.  Pause.  God.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  This guy is Jesus, by the way.  He's just like Jesus.  They show, I guess they're complete strangers, and they're in a bed, and she doesn't have much  on, and she basically said, when you want to change the cuddle position, just let me know.  He's got his rod on her ass that way? 
[01:05:00]  Of course.  Of course he does.  Yeah, because they can't kick you out when you start poking them.  That is fucking weird.  These two don't know each other, right?  No, she works at the cuddle house.  Right.  Even that dirty pillow.  You want to be on someone else's fucking dirty pillow?  Yeah.  Smelling bad breath.  Yeah.  What's this plaque breath or tartar breath on your cuddle partner?  Neat.  All right, let's continue.  There's a lot of therapeutic value in a, you know, wholesome, pure sense of physical contact. 
[01:05:30]  The snuggle house will soon be much like what you see here from the snugglery in New York.  I make sure they understand that it's not sexual.  Sexual?  Oh, really?  No.  Leave it at the door.  Healing?  Oh.  Yes.  Sorry.  Why is there no fat pig snugglers?  I would jerk off on their door.  You said leave it at the door.  You've got to leave this somewhere.  He told me.  Right. 
[01:06:00]  Wait, how come there's no fat fucking snugglers working for them?  Yeah, no sex, but we, you know.  But we make sure they're very attractive.  Yeah.  Who wants a fatty?  Yeah.  Therapeutic place.  Sexual healing?  Doubtful.  I want to be in love with the whole world.  I want to be in love with every single person I meet.  The lines could become messy, and if they become too messy, we would just end that client relationship.  Client snuggler relationship.  Client snuggler.  Diana Rohde will manage the place, and already she has a handful of professional snugglers, including the lone man Lonnie. 
[01:06:30]  It's like my goal in life to spread love.  They know the idea is out there for some folks.  I'm totally ready for kind of people to be against it or not understand, and I'm okay with that.  Ms. Carlson.  But if they can reach just one person who's joined, then they say that already makes their world a softer place.  I heard they shut this fucker down.  I mean, that's what Tim's going to suggest.  We all have a group cuddle before the show. 
[01:07:00]  Talk it over.  I think they're starting up a whole other house.  Imagine having to spoon with Tim.  We'll all get on the floor and spoon with Tim.  Dice had a really funny joke about cuddling, how the girl wants to cuddle.  And when they cuddle, he goes, yeah, why don't you cuddle my prick with your two-inch cunt lips?  What a pig.  Oh, is that a piggish thing to say?  Oh, my God.  He said it so angrily.  We've got a big meeting today.  I think we should do a cuddle thing. 
[01:07:30]  A little cuddling.  Get everyone on the same page, right?  That's a great idea.  So they're starting a cuddle house.  Yeah, because they keep getting kicked out of places.  There's got to be ridiculous frustrations, sexual frustrations if you go to a cuddle house.  Oh, my God.  How are you separating those two things?  We saw the lady.  She had her toes in between the guy's crotch as they were cuddling.  Yeah, yeah.  That's too close, man.  But they're trying to send out the signal, like, it's going to be a good hug.  Let's look it up.  I could be in there in a few minutes and tell you if it's going to be sexual or not. 
[01:08:00]  I'm really good at this.  I was like, I'm going to change the world one snuggle at a time.  Oh, she thinks she's hilarious.  She's having a one.  I mean, we're like sort of happy like we just seriously want more love, more peace.  More connections.  She's an ass.  Fucking piece of pussy.  Well, Hannah says that already more than 55 people have signed up for appointments and says veterans,  the elderly, and those who have lost loved ones may really benefit from a snuggle.  That's great.  But we should also mention the city is watching the business closely. 
[01:08:30]  There's no record of occupancy permits or a fire inspection to date.  That deadline to get it done might as well be Tuesday when the snuggle house is set to open,  giving free hugs on the Capitol all day long.  I think some folks at the Capitol could use a hug.  I'm sure.  I've been in Madison 16 years.  Madison is very open to a lot of different ideas,  but I'm interested to see how people react to this on our Facebook page and other places.  Why do you have to send them to your fucking Facebook page to like the story?  Come on.  Is that it?  I'll say this, though.  It's only 60 bucks. 
[01:09:00]  What, you found a cuddle house?  I'm just looking up the, I guess I just Googled it,  and for $60, customers at the snuggle house can spend an hour.  An hour for 60 bucks is not sexual.  Oh, boy.  That's a long fucking time for 60 beans.  Oh, of course.  I don't know.  But it says $60.  Rope to hang yourself is extra.  Snuggle house.  That's all they say about it?  Oh, cuddle party.  No, there's a whole story, but.  Human touch. 
[01:09:30]  Now in our 11th year.  They do giant parties and everything.  It's not sexual.  It's just cuddling.  It's an orgy.  It's like an orgy.  They probably, yeah.  But that's what.  I think it's weirdos with maternal issues.  Ah.  You know.  Yeah.  Like they're sleeping in their mommy's bed again.  But when we were all starting our sex lives, you know, cuddling was pretty huge.  In the beginning, yeah.  You had a party or something.  Also like, all right, we're just going to cuddle, right?  Turned into dry humping.  Right.  Very quickly.  You attempt a little dry hump.  A little dry humping. 
[01:10:00]  Let's see what that gets you.  Now, ladies, calm down.  I know that's a sexy term.  Dry humping.  Move the hips a little bit.  See if it's welcoming.  See if she's receptive.  Right.  See if she moves them back.  You move your hand up a little bit.  Right.  Right.  Rub your little boner on the back.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  And see if she jerks away.  Right.  Get under that shirt.  If she stays there.  Get under that shirt.  Get under that shirt.  Right?  Feeling all of a sudden, it's like, oh, I'm almost to the bottom of the boob. 
[01:10:30]  You can feel the hot through her pants.  Oh, what feels better than that?  Like a fucking furnace.  Feeling the hot.  Like a furnace.  I'm still wearing jeans.  Oh, how good is that?  Dude, you ever rub the thigh and as you get closer, you can feel the heat coming off the pussy?  That is fucking amazing.  I immediately throw ice on it.  Oh, you got it.  Cool this off, please.  You're going to burn up.  Ew, ew.  Let's go to...  Put your hand up the shirt and get some bra for the first time.  Yeah.  But it all starts with a cuddle.  Who are we kidding?  That's great. 
[01:11:00]  Let's go to Larry in Tennessee.  Larry.  Larry.  Hey, guys.  Love your show.  Of course you do.  I heard you guys talk about this, and I had seen a video a couple weeks ago on WorldStar.  A guy did a little mini-documentary about this going on in Japan already for quite a while.  The guy set up a dating service where they just go out to bars and have drinks and whatnot,  and they have cuddle houses all over the place over there.  Well, that figures.  Japan is a little weird.  I think Americans are still in the industry. 
[01:11:30]  Man, I don't know.  It definitely seems really strange.  Yeah.  That's one big fucking tease.  We're talking blue balls.  Right, right.  Well, I love the show, guys.  That's all I hate.  All right.  Yeah, if you were just cuddling all night when you were younger and you're cuddling, you know,  but you didn't get anything.  That was pretty...  Oh, that was blue balls.  Like crazy.  But it was also like you've said over the years.  That's like hardcore sex.  Oh, yeah.  You were willing to...  Depending on what age you were.  ...forgo the orgasm. 
[01:12:00]  You just...  Very exciting.  Touch something.  Oh, extremely.  You're not sleeping the entire night.  Nope.  Oh, my God.  No way.  Up against a girl.  It sucked if you did fall asleep for like an hour and you woke up and was like,  I wasted an hour of time that I could have spent cuddling, dry humping, chafing.  Oh, your fucking dick is just like chopped meat where the girl would be asleep.  Yeah.  And you're just sitting there and just...  I bet she's going to wake up.  Wake up.  I bet she's going to wake up.  And you realize she's dead.  You didn't see half the fucker. 
[01:12:30]  Did she have a finger in her asshole?  See if she's still kicking.  Making cumzies in your pants.  Yep.  That's a lost art form.  Oh, yeah.  Keep giving her this soft little boner poke, hoping that I'll wake her up.  Oh, yeah.  Birdman from Long Island.  I remember you.  What's up, Bird?  What's up, buddy?  How are you, man?  It's $60 to get fucking blue balls.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  I think you're absolutely right.  It's too much of a tease for guys.  Hey, I was hanging out with this chicken in Queens one time.  Chicken?  Pretty hot.  That's chicken. 
[01:13:00]  That's why they call me Birdman.  Chicken.  He's quick.  He's quick, this birdman.  He's almost stopped.  Yeah, that's why they call me Birdman.  I'm a fucking chicken.  You're with this chick.  What happened?  I was banging his bro in Brooklyn, so I live on Long Island.  So I'm fucking around with her, and all of a sudden she just stops.  I drove on the BQE with the biggest shit of blue balls.  Had to pull over and jerk off on the side of the road.  Yeah, you jerked off on the BQE.  I want to give Birdman the 11 to 3 slot on the channel. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, who wouldn't?  I love Birdman.  Perfect fit.  You gotta fucking jerk off on the BQE.  I don't even think there's a place to pull over on the BQE.  You don't have to.  There's always traffic.  Oh, okay.  There is one right by the bridge.  No, it's right by the bridge.  By the guanice.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay.  You keep fucking that chicken.  Jack off.  All right, Birdman.  You call back any time.  Jacking off on the BQE.  Let's give the Birdman the easy pass for the show. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  He calls you.  Put him right through.  That's like all sex bagels shitting on the alley.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we...  So now we got a video called Want to Cuddle a Stranger?  Go to Japan.  Right.  This is the...  What?  It's called Assault on a Train.  Yeah, they love that.  Play it from the beginning.  We'll tap out when it gets boring.  What is this, a little documentary on the whole thing?  No, it's a quickie.  Oh, it is.  It's a CNN story.  Oh, okay.  Go.  One of the largest and most densely populated anywhere in the world.  Also famous for its tireless workers, or salarymen. 
[01:14:30]  And here in Tokyo's Akihabara District, a place that's known for quirky ideas, one former  salaryman himself has come up with a very unique business.  A co-sleeping specialty shop.  Hi.  Yes.  People come here to cuddle.  Masashi Koda tells me.  Before you let your mind run wild, he says, yes, it is just cuddling.  Nothing more.  Customers pay about $40 to sleep next to a girl for 20 minutes. 
[01:15:00]  Some customers are young men looking for simple companionship.  That's fucking...  Those two bombs fucked them up.  Something terrible.  You had Hiroki visits the shop almost every day.  He tells me, I like coming here.  It's unique and relaxing.  I try to stay awake because I enjoy talking with the girls.  Oh, God.  Do you have a girlfriend?  Oh, no.  No, I don't.  Good American haircut.  I never had a lot of chances to meet girls.  It is spanky.  So this is refreshing for me. 
[01:15:30]  19-year-old Pena is a student.  Awful-ass pillows.  Oh, she's 19.  She works here part-time.  Yes, you do, God.  She says most guys come here to relax and rest after working hard all day.  They've clearly hit a nerve.  It's about 9 o'clock on Thursday night right now.  It's 9 o'clock on a Thursday.  It's not big.  It's about 400 square feet in total.  There are added services as well, but again, don't get any ideas.  Oh, okay.  1,000 yen, about $13. 
[01:16:00]  Put your head on our legs.  If you want to rest your head on the girl's knees.  Don't touch my head.  Very expensive American head, dude.  $13 for a five-second hug.  She says he is surprised at all the attention his business is getting.  And yes, he is thinking of a possible expansion.  We might move to a bigger and cleaner space.  But maybe the simplicity is part of our charm.  Everyone say a cleaner space.  A simple idea in a stressed out and sometimes lonely city. 
[01:16:30]  It's like a Pokemon behind her.  He's falling in love with her.  Look at her milky white legs.  There's not a guy I know that wouldn't try to get more from a cuddling situation.  You'd have to.  You've got to be a fucking weirdo.  Even with the person that you're with, I couldn't see cuddling for free for more than three and a half minutes.  And then you're just snoozing.  You're either asleep or having sex.  $13 for a hug.  For five seconds. 
[01:17:00]  She times it.  How romantic.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Done.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Stop a hug.  That's it.  Me pay for another hug.  He's got his slick American hair.  My spanky American head.  Look like a rock and roll star.  They look like a Billy Idol.  Yes.  Is that who he's going for?  Billy Idol? 
[01:17:30]  I go for Billy Idol.  Well, there's some wacky things going on over there.  Yeah.  The Japanese, they got some strange shit.  They got those strange customs.  Have you heard about the clubs in Japan that have glass floors?  Oh, boy.  And the guys go into the club through the basement so they can look up at the skirts, panties  and holes and stuff.  And the girls are hired to be there.  They just sit on the floor, right? 
[01:18:00]  What happens to the honorable samurai and everything?  Now they're down to looking up skirts.  Yeah.  But I would do that for more of a goof than a turn-on.  It'd be fine.  I'd be like, this is hilarious.  You throw a couple of trannies in there just to make sure.  Yeah.  Just to keep everyone honest.  Oh, I take a shit on the floor.  That'd be great.  Girls just pissing and shitting on the floor, skating around in their own waist. 
[01:18:30]  I would laugh.  I would laugh.  Even if they were really hot, because it just seems so silly.  It's goofy.  And you know you're just hanging out with a whole bunch of perverts.  It is goofy.  Yeah.  It's more goofy than hot.  Just cuddling, though.  And kettle.  Let's say hi to Tim in Miami.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I was watching a Vice documentary.  And they were talking about how young people in Japan, they don't have sex anymore. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, no?  Where are the Japanese coming from?  What do you mean they don't have sex anymore?  Crazy.  They're not getting married.  They're just not having sex.  What are they doing?  They're so much digital shit.  Yeah.  They go into those little...  They do all the anime shit.  They do...  They just...  They don't hook up.  Everybody's focused on their career.  So they are, like, for sexual gratification, go to the services.  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Like cuddling.  And so there's no human contact.  So they just go to these little shops and cuddle.  Do you know that a lot of people don't know this, but a lot of girls gave me the nickname  Cuddle Bunny.  You don't like my nickname?  Oh.  Ugh.  No.  Are you a cuddle buddy?  No, Cuddle Bunny.  Oh, Cuddle Bunny.  Hi, Cuddle Bunny's here.  Yeah, I think that's adorable.  That's terrible.  It's rough. 
[01:20:00]  That's rough.  That's rough.  Jesus.  I can't even look at you.  That makes you uncomfortable, Cuddle Bunny?  I'm a Cuddle Bunny.  Is there a place like this in New York?  Yeah.  Apparently the gym or our fucking locker room.  Jesus.  Send Bobo to one of those places.  He'd be great.  Yeah, there's a...  Oh, my God.  Oh, would that be great?  We'll cuddle.  Oh, God.  Just want to cuddle.  They try to cuddle his neck with a rope.  You should send him there.  You know, he'd just be poking at her with the fuck and his dumb little boner. 
[01:20:30]  And then have him come back and talk about it.  But that's the problem.  He won't be able to really communicate what actually happened at the Cuddle House.  Cuddling.  He starts to mumble.  Cuddling.  Cuddling.  I think this might be a job for Sal.  We'll send Sal to a Cuddle House.  Ugh.  There's a snuggle house in our area?  Oh, the one with just men?  He just yelled, I'll totally do it.  Oh, of course I will.  Where's your snuggle house in our area, Yurok?  Oh, wait.  Uh...  Pale. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, that's your thing.  What is she?  She looks like an Amish.  She looks fucking crazy.  I want to cut a gasser while I'm cuddling.  I'd like to have a giant veggie juice and then go to the Cuddle House.  That's right.  Cuddle House and you give her the old Dutch oven.  Dude, what a great fucking hidden video that would be.  If you somehow cuddle and drop gassers in the Cuddle House.  Oh, that'd be funny.  Oh, just fucking putrid gassers.  This one's in Rochester. 
[01:21:30]  Really?  Rochester.  Yeah, the Snuggery.  The Snuggery in Rochester.  What do they offer?  A little buggery at the Snuggery.  I wish I would have known that was there when I was up there.  No kidding.  I would have got my cuddle on.  It's $50 for 45 minutes.  And what happens?  Or you can go 90 minutes for $90.  $50.  Okay.  Okay.  What happens?  Can you choose your cuddle person?  You cuddle.  How many people do they have working there?  Uh, it doesn't say, but you can choose.  Okay. 
[01:22:00]  So they line them up and you're like, I'll take that one.  Like the Whois?  Like they do at Whois?  Like a bunny ranch.  Oh, wait.  We got a guy from Rochester calling.  What?  Get the fuck out of here.  Terry Clifford works in a Snuggle House on her days off.  Let's go to Owen.  She could take 10 men at a time.  Yeah, she snuggles a pizza.  Monster.  Owen.  Monster.  Hey, Opie, I want to tell you about a huge snuggle party coming up Thursday night.  Come on.  It's in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Improv. 
[01:22:30]  Oh.  And, you know, you can still get kicked out.  Oh.  Damn, you're good, brother.  You are good.  Yes, and there's plenty of snuggle room left.  Oh, God.  Wait, when is this going down?  My gig this Thursday at the Improv in L.A.  Yeah, a few seats open at the Improv.  What the fuck?  We're not promoting it, though.  Well, we promoted it a little bit.  A little bit.  We should promote it more.  But Jimmy's going to be at the Improv in L.A.  That's awesome.  Uh-huh.  Go see Jimmy this Thursday night.  Yeah.  Who's that?  We got some L.A. fans, right? 
[01:23:00]  Is that a cuddle girl?  Yeah, she offers snuggery.  Oh, God.  Snuggery sounds a little dirty.  Very pale girls at these snuggle things.  Yeah, but they have crazy eyes.  What's that about?  That's what they do for a living.  They cuddle guys with tartar breath whose hair smells like dandruff and scalp.  And turgid penises.  Drool on the pillow.  Put your head down on some guy's wet drool.  All right.  Not sexual.  That's what we learned today. 
[01:23:30]  No.  Just cuddling.  Seems a little strange.  Not one woman called.  We're the ladies.  I want to get their fucking point of view.  They like cuddling.  They understand.  It's real.  They're on the receiving end of a good penis poke.  Oh, yeah.  As you're cuddling.  Another thing was, as a kid, you weren't used to sleeping with a girl.  And even if you did just have sex or you were dry humming or something and you fell asleep,  you'd turn into a fucking sleepwalking zombie fucking dry humper. 
[01:24:00]  You're just like grinding.  I remember waking up with my hands down a girl's pants.  It's fucking.  The half awake.  It's my sister.  Yeah, the half awake.  The half awake groping.  Oh, wow.  I thought I was dreaming.  I'm sorry.  How great is that?  Yeah.  A little grope.  You have deniability.  What?  I was.  I was sleeping.  What are you doing?  Come on.  I'm not really awake.  What?  What?  I was cuddling.  What?  All right. 
[01:24:30]  I'm sorry.  That's it for cuddling.  Yeah, we'd have to send Sal to Thorndale, Pennsylvania on the 18th.  Thorndale?  How far is that?  Why on the 18th?  That's when the cuddle party is happening.  No, we don't want a cuddle party because that's like.  We want one on one.  We want the more intimate thing where you go into a cuddle house and they give you room.  We've got to send him to Rochester then.  Sal, you've got to go to Rochester during a Christmas break.  Is that all right with you?  He's good for it. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Eric, you sound chipper this morning.  What's that?  Oh.  It was a very nice party you had the other night.  Thank you.  Amber.  Sorry, I didn't make it to Iraq.  It's okay.  The Brady Bunch was on.  We all knew you weren't going.  You just wanted to make sure you were invited.  Probably.  That's true.  I was so old.  I didn't think driving to Jersey and drinking and driving home was going to be.  You had no intention of going from the get-go.  No, I actually did.  You just wanted to make sure that you had the proper invite.  I actually wanted to go. 
[01:25:30]  And if I would have found somebody to go with, I probably would have gone.  But I just couldn't.  How long did it take?  You're an hour from your place?  Yeah, pretty much.  I couldn't.  And I'm not that far from Iraq.  I couldn't get motivated to drive and then drink and then stop drinking and drive back.  You would have been at least two and a half hours to get there.  Yeah, I don't blame you.  I had family that was stuck on the George Washington Bridge just trying to get from Long Island to here.  Yeah, it just, you know, I would have liked to have gone, you know, if that was worth anything. 
[01:26:00]  I heard it was fun.  We got a broad on the line.  Oh, yeah?  I don't want to miss this opportunity.  Got a broad in the car.  Amber.  Hi, guys.  I love you guys so much.  I love your alerts.  Which one do you love?  Which one do you love the most?  I love Jimmy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Why, hello, Amber.  Jesus.  What a little hard ass.  Really, man?  I'm an asshole.  Well, hey there, babe.  Hi.  Hi, Amber.  So you don't like cuddling, Amber? 
[01:26:30]  I hate cuddling.  It's so annoying.  It's hot.  It's sticky.  Just have the sex.  Quick hug.  Get it over with.  You're done.  Jesus.  How do you do?  What do you shake hands like you just had a business deal?  Hey, as long as you walk them downstairs after they're done, right?  Wow.  Look at you.  Do tell.  You're like a whore.  She's like a guy.  Yeah, you are.  You're like a guy.  You're like a guy.  Let's fucking get it over with.  No?  Well, as long as the sex, as long as the sex lasts long, I'm fine with that. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  But afterwards, it's just done.  Just take it for what it is.  How long is long?  You don't like a long, hot cuddle after a little premature ejaculation?  Yeah.  You just put the tip and the guy shoots a load and then wants to snuggle with you.  Oh, Christ.  While his dick is still inside you, like he's only got, like, how a guy would look with  a beanie on his head.  That's how much of his cock is in you.  All limp, just hanging there.  Your vagina looks like it's just going, meh. 
[01:27:30]  As long as you're coming on the boobs, I'm fine with that.  Whoa.  Holy old tip coming.  How about shoving it in your fucking mouth?  Yeah.  That's fine, too.  You know, wherever.  I like a closed system when coming.  You know, pull out, shove it right in your fucking yap.  There you go.  Hey, Nick, you got to shove the girl up.  You're a romantic.  You are.  Jesus.  No hugging, no cuddling.  Just come on her tits and fucking shake her hand like you're closing a deal and kick 
[01:28:00]  her out the door.  All right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I could not agree with you guys more.  I love you guys.  I'm on the turnpike, and it's pretty shitty down here.  All right.  Well, be safe.  Weather report.  Thank you, everyone.  Is it going to snow today, I heard?  Three inches locally, perhaps.  It started snowing already in New York City?  You can't see past, like, the next building.  Really?  Between seven and ten, they say it's going to snow here.  Probably three inches outlying areas to the south, perhaps up to six inches.  Oh, God.  Be careful out there, guys. 
[01:28:30]  Say hi to Pollyanna in Kentucky.  She's a real Pollyanna.  Yeah, she is.  That's what that means.  I absolutely am.  Are you?  What does that mean, Pollyanna?  What does it mean?  Yeah.  It means, like, a goody two-shoes?  No, I'm not a goody two-shoes.  I think that means you both pay for dinner or something.  Oh.  I thought that was a Dutch treat.  No, it's the Pollyanna.  The oven is the Dutch treat.  I'm giving you a Dutch treat.  Awesome.  Hi.  What's up?  What I think about the snuggling thing is I work 12-hour shifts for shitty money, 
[01:29:00]  and I'd absolutely, for 60 bucks an hour, have a guy lay his head on my lap.  No doubt.  That's good.  Are you, um...  Smell your fishy vaggie after a hard day at work?  Oh, that's great.  I'm sorry.  That was a high school boy joke.  I'm sorry.  Sit all day doing data entry or something.  What do you want?  No, I'm a nurse.  I'm a nurse.  Oh, so you're on your feet.  I do really shitty things for, you know, less money than...  Oh, yeah.  So cuddling with you would be nothing.  Oh, that's easy for you.  You'd change shit and fucking put thermometers up people's asses. 
[01:29:30]  Right.  I put more than thermometers up their asses.  Oh, nice.  Do tell.  That's sexy.  What, uh, are you a good-looking gal?  You should just turn into a naughty nurse, man.  Oh, a naughty nurse.  Naughty, naughty.  I hate those naughty nurse outfits.  They always look like they're from the 30s.  They look real?  With the big red cross on their hat.  What the fuck is that?  Well, we basically wear Garan.  What are you fucking...  At Pearl Harbor?  What?  I hate the naughty nurse.  That just says ass play. 
[01:30:00]  What do you hate worse?  Naughty nurse or French maid?  French maid is stupid, too.  I've never seen a maid dress like that.  With the fucking skirt, the short skirt and the frills.  And a duster.  And the little head thing she wears that looks like a doily.  I don't want it to be Halloween when I'm having sex.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Well, while you're dusting, let me come over here.  Also, she walks in the room as a French maid.  You don't like that?  No.  And if there's a nurse, a naughty nurse, what, are you supposed to be sick? 
[01:30:30]  Right.  Is that why she's there?  You'd have to be sick.  You're supposed to just cough as she blows you.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  I'm sick.  You just want to go ahead and vomit on me.  Yeah, let's fuck.  I just had three feet of my colon removed.  Yeah, I come up with a really unsexy fantasy.  Like, what are you here for?  I have leukemia.  I've got brain cancer.  Cancer of the tongue and throat.  And genitals.  I have penile cancer and AIDS.  Can you help me?  Cancer of the prick.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  Yeah, I hate that whole fucking fantasy play shit.  And if you're doing the naughty nurse, that just means you want something in your ass as a guy.  Because that's all she can do as the naughty nurse.  Just give you an enema or something?  Yeah, it's a fucking enema thing.  Who wants that?  Hands up.  Oh, yeah.  Hands up.  Hands up.  Hands up.  Oh, jeez.  All right, Pollyanna.  That was terrific.  Yes.  Thanks.  Thanks.  You guys have a good day.  Yeah, you too, Kentucky. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, bye.  Yeah.  We're going to break here.  Administer the shocker stat.  I was hoping we'd get more out of the cuddle thing, but.  I think we got enough.  It just seems really strange to me.  It is.  All right.  We're going to talk about the guy who killed himself because his wife was shopping too much.  Yeah.  Obviously, the guy had other issues, right?  He's a hero.  Right?  Yeah.  Got to think.  Well, that does get annoying.  That whole shopping thing.  Yeah, but you just smile and just fucking deal with it.  It's. 
[01:32:00]  I don't know.  It's everything.  If it's everything to them, then you just fucking, if you care about the person, just  fucking deal with it.  I feel like when I go shopping.  Look around and look at the hot girls and stuff.  I don't know.  I just fucking.  Look at the juice in the mall.  I feel like it's going to be like this meeting.  Well, that's really racist.  Oh, the juice.  I think the meeting's going to feel like when I had to go shopping with somebody I don't  like.  You can jump out the window.  Yes.  I might jump out the window.  All right.  It's snowing in New York, and we've got a big meeting after the show. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, I can't wait.  I can't wait for the big meeting.  It's a new start for everyone, right?  Yeah.  It's going to be a good meeting.  Look, man, we bitched and cried about Steve Platter and Gary and Rob, and now we've got  Tim Sabian.  We've got to give him a chance, guys. 
[01:33:00]  It's not going to be one of the stuffy meetings.  Remember when we had two meetings with the old bosses?  I don't remember many of them, because I fell asleep during many of the meetings.  Tim's a great guy, but he can't do anything that we need to forward the show.  It's not in any reflection.  That's what I think.  No, none.  He can do stuff internally, but how is he going to do anything that makes things better?  I think we're going to talk about doing stuff on the show.  Bits.  We have ideas.  That's great.  We have pitch stuff.  Right.  How the operation works.  Right.  Allow me to show you my operation.  Hey, let's do this next Friday. 
[01:33:30]  Job description.  Hey, let's do this when we come back.  How to handle guests.  Okay, yeah.  Redo the studio a little bit.  Oh, boy.  Redo the studio.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I am so disappointed in you.  You just, you really are holding on to that studio thing.  I saw one of the guys that stood in here.  Oh, with the tape measure?  And the clipboards.  Yeah.  And now when he passes me, he just puts his head down.  Puts his head down.  Because he knows.  And well, he should.  He knows.  That liar.  No, he wasn't one of the liars. 
[01:34:00]  Uh-huh.  He was with the liar.  Yes.  I bet there'll be a lot of liars around here.  I bet they get a little bit changed in the studio.  You think?  A little bit.  Minor.  Bullshit.  But Tim can't do that stuff because it has to come from above, and they do not believe  in the show.  It's nothing to do with Tim.  He just simply doesn't have the power to do that stuff.  I know.  I mean, if they didn't believe in the show, they wouldn't be paying us a boatload of money  to do it.  Oh, Jesus.  They don't believe in the show.  They pay us because they know it's a necessary.  A boatload.  What?  They know that people like it, but if they believed in it, they would do something to 
[01:34:30]  forward it, and they don't.  You know one thing I heard?  Because I'm in some secret meetings.  They're going to spread out that money a little bit?  I'm in some secret meetings.  Secret meetings?  My big thing is I want the show heard on both Sirius and XM.  Of course.  We're on XM, clear.  Sirius, you've got to buy the best of XM package.  And I'm like, it would be so great for us on the show if we just opened us up to the  Sirius audience, because our audience would, maybe not double, but it would be a huge 
[01:35:00]  increase.  It would probably go up at least 20%.  So at least 20%.  And much easier to listen to.  Just find it while they're flipping through channels.  And this is how selfish the company is.  They will not do that because they make too much money off the best of XM packages.  That's crazy.  So they're holding us back over a money thing.  Yeah, of course.  That's crazy.  We're not going to change that.  Tim can't change that.  That was told to me.  I'm not BSing anyone.  None of that horse shit.  You can make believe all you want that the show is failing and all that.  You know, the haters, they babble on every fucking day. 
[01:35:30]  No, they don't.  But it was absolutely told to me they make way too much money on the best of XM package  to open us up to the Sirius audience.  And then meanwhile, Ron and Fez will be on a channel that's on both.  Yeah.  Congratulations to them.  Yeah, it's a great move for Ron and Fez.  That is great.  It's a great move.  It's a great move for Ron and Fez.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  It's a great move.  Fez is coming back, though.  I said his name.  Coming back strong.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I said his name.  He did nature, boy.  What?  Woo!  Woo!  Love it. 
[01:36:00]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Oh, my God!  I'm back, Roddy!  Oh, my God!  Woo!  Woo!  Holy shit.  I'm back, Roddy!  Hi for Fezitorio!  Sam, why are you making Ovi do this?  I don't have that kind of power.  Woo! 
[01:36:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  I enjoyed the nature boy for the record.  Oh, it's fucking funny.  Yeah.  You just took my advice.  That's what it was.  Uh-huh.  I'll say this.  I hope he's back.  There you go.  Mm-hmm.  I hope.  But the meeting's going to be terrific.  We're going to talk about the Super Bowl and where this show's going to be.  What do you mean?  Hmm?  We're going to be at Caroline's.  Why?  For two days.  Huh?  Knock yourselves out.  Yeah.  Have a good time there.  We're going to be at Caroline's.  Enjoy.  Do you want to watch a comedy? 
[01:37:00]  We don't want to be at Radio Row.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'll go to Caroline's for Super Bowl, but it's going to cost them $350,000.  See?  Nice.  You know, quid pro quo.  There's no way it's worth it to them.  Huh?  Why?  Why?  Exactly.  One lie after another, dude.  It's frustrating.  They're doing the ass-lapping party, and they're paying handsomely for that.  Which ass-lapping party?  Howard Stern thing.  That's just one big ass-lapping party.  It's not even his birthday on that day.  And they've got to pay him to show up. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, man.  $350,000?  Way more than $350,000.  What?  I can guarantee that.  Oh, my goodness.  I would guess it's at least a mil for him to show up to that crap.  But you know what?  We do have the big ping pong match.  That's coming up for the big Christmas party, I guess, huh?  I actually lost sleep over thinking about the ping pong match last night.  How did you lose sleep over?  Because I guess there's a Christmas-  Oh, sorry.  Don't say that. 
[01:38:00]  Word.  Winter festival gathering.  It's a fucking Christmas, you suckers.  Right?  If you do it around Christmas, it's Christmas, no matter what you call it.  Yes, Kenny?  I feel the need to bring something to your-  The need for speed?  The need for speed.  The company memo just went out.  Ooh.  Yeah?  Because of the severity of the storm, you can use your discretion about your commute, so-  Holy fuck.  Good night. 
[01:38:30]  I am discretioning.  No.  No?  What?  You'll be fine.  We're doing a meeting today.  We have a show.  No, it says you can work from home.  No, you can't work from home.  We don't have ISDN set up.  But for the meeting, I could just call in.  Can't we do go-to-meeting?  Why don't we just do go-to-meeting?  Yeah, we got go-to-meeting.  Let's do go-to-meeting.  The meeting's at 10 o'clock.  You could do HD faces with your cell phone or your fucking tablet.  How could it possibly be safer for you to call into the meeting from your phone that you're 
[01:39:00]  in your car while you're driving through the snow?  I'll put the phone on the dashboard.  I'll fucking talk.  It'll be great.  Wait.  Is there a use your discretion thing going down right now?  Here's the thing.  If I ever heard that and I was like one of the cubicle workers, I would be discretioning  my ass to my car so quickly.  But why are we?  Because we're on air.  We're superheroes.  It says your safety is the first priority, so please use your discretion.  What is it?  Discretion?  Discretion.  Discretion! 
[01:39:30]  Regarding your commute, but as a broadcast facility, we are open 24-7.  What does that mean?  All programming, broadcast, and other critical personnel, which is you guys, should follow  the policy and procedures in place for your department.  What does that mean?  You guys are critical personnel.  What's the policy and procedure for our department?  You're here.  Who said that?  Hey, uh.  This fucking chick.  Can we talk about the ping pong party? 
[01:40:00]  So what is it called?  The winter festival gathering?  That's right.  Winter festival gathering.  And the beer bash.  This Scott Greenstein, he set up a ping pong match with Sway.  Last big fiesta of the year.  Yeah.  And it's being promoted as a big deal because it was part of the memo that went out.  With Sway and who?  Scott Greenstein.  Oh.  And then I was thinking about it.  I lost sleep because I'm thinking about how douchey it's going to be because they're  going to be playing a ping pong match.  And then everyone's going to be like, oh, the boss. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, boo.  And Greenstein's going to be like, oh, they're playing that part of, oh, boo, the boss.  But he doesn't understand that.  Everyone doesn't like him.  Oh, God.  And it's not a put on.  Would you sit there and watch the ping pong match?  Maybe.  Yeah.  If they played with bullets.  I bet Scott's pretty good at it.  If he just imagines the ball is a good idea and he just has to keep knocking them away  if they come at him.  Yeah.  If the ball is human contact and emotion and he's knocking it away. 
[01:41:00]  Just knocking it away every time it comes near him.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  It's probably where that came from.  Of course.  His ping pong prowess.  Everyone sits around and then has to kind of like.  It's horrendous.  Root against the boss during a ping pong match.  A lot of clapping.  Like that.  Guys that haven't had a raise in seven years.  They're going to sit around and play into that.  Laugh.  Yeah.  What day are we not going to the winter festival gathering? 
[01:41:30]  Yes, it is Thursday.  This Thursday?  God damn it.  I'll be gone.  It's Thursday afternoon.  At five.  Right?  Yeah.  Maybe I'll stay in the city.  Dude, you should so come.  Should I?  There you go.  Yeah.  It'd be fucking hilarious.  I might want to stay in the city then.  I'm not going.  I'll stay in my apartment maybe and show up at five.  Why would you do that?  For Friday's show.  Talk about it.  Yeah.  Take video.  Post it.  Yeah.  The big fucking ping pong match. 
[01:42:00]  Who am I kidding?  I wouldn't go to that fucking shit.  You're not going to it.  Why?  You're lucky you make it here.  I know.  With the new Xbox One at my house.  I'm not going anywhere.  You want my 360?  What?  No.  I don't think Xbox One at my house.  He will say that he's going to the big holiday gathering, but then we'll read his Twitter  and he'll be watching the Brady Bunch.  Xbox, watch Me TV.  Just switches to fucking Brady Bunch.  Wow.  Xbox, watch TBS.  And bam.  There's a sign.  Can you play DVDs on your Xbox?  Yes.  Blu-ray.  Oh, Blu-ray.  Oh. 
[01:42:30]  Who's he?  It's fucking...  He needed to buy me.  You have the Me TV network programmed in here?  You watch Me TV that often?  It's not programmed.  I could just say it.  Xbox knows.  Xbox knows.  Why are we still talking?  What?  We're in the middle of a use your discretion.  What's wrong with us?  Well, we have to adhere to the policies that are departments to something, blah, blah, blah.  You're critical personnel.  We are critical personnel.  Critical personnel.  Nice.  Critical personnel.  You need to be here.  You need to go to the meeting after the show.  Nice.  And go to the party. 
[01:43:00]  And you have to be at the party on Thursday.  I ain't going to no fucking party.  I am going to a party Thursday.  Oh, cool.  Which party?  Someone else's, though?  Yeah.  Good one?  Going to the dementia house.  Oh, boy.  What's dementia house?  That's where they put the old people.  Oh, Jesus.  They're having their Christmas party.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That's got to be fucking cheery.  Oh, my God.  I was asked to go to the Christmas party, so I'll be going. 
[01:43:30]  Fuck that.  Why?  I don't know.  There's a bit of dementia in those hallways.  Oh, God.  Any ping pong?  Hell, nah.  I'm sad.  I'm really sad I missed D-Rock's party because I hear tell there were some things going on.  What things?  That Roland was the shittiest guest at a party ever.  Oh, my God.  Well, he brought his own desserts.  He brought his own desserts.  He was lambast.  I heard he was, like, telling your family that they had pedestrian desserts. 
[01:44:00]  He said the bread wasn't close enough to the sauce.  Like, he was bashing fucking...  But he knows this shit.  You know, you go to a party, you don't start fucking criticizing things.  And when he said yesterday, he goes, Anthony, is bringing your own dessert, you know, is that a bad thing to do?  And I said yesterday, I went, no, because I thought he meant bringing a dessert to a party.  He brought his own dessert.  One dessert.  A few.  He went to the Krona place.  Uh-huh.  And he walked into E-Rock's house with a little shopping bag with dessert in it. 
[01:44:30]  And everybody was bringing something.  A bottle of wine.  I didn't bring anything.  I have a terrible house guest.  Everybody accepts him.  I apologize.  Bring your humor and love.  But then Roland, he took his dessert bag, and he walked to the kitchen table, and he sat down, and he put his dessert bag under his chair.  Yes.  And he sat there, guarding his dessert, until the Nagel family brought out the desserts for the party, at which point everybody... 
[01:45:00]  The pedestrian desserts.  Everybody went into the dining room.  Because they're calling that, like you said.  Yeah, yeah.  And Roland proclaimed he wouldn't be eating the pedestrian desserts, and took his own dessert out, and put it on the table, refusing to share with anybody except Opie and Who Kid.  Yeah, that's prickish.  I fucking made it.  Yeah, it's delicious.  My first Krona.  I passed the last time you brought them around.  They are ridiculous.  Really good.  Yeah, and then he had a new raspberry, Brioche Azur, Who Kid.  Oh my God, this is the best.  What desserts did the Nagels have, Nagel? 
[01:45:30]  There was a lot of stuff.  Yesterday, Roland was telling everybody in the office that all of Eric's desserts came from Costco, and that's why he would not be eating them.  Holy shit.  I said it had a Costco-esque feel to it, so I would be surprised.  I'll tell you what.  Well, someone actually brought in a box of crumbs, something from crumbs, and he was visceral.  He just wanted to...  Ugh, crumbs.  He made this face, and then this noise I've never heard before.  He was really mad that someone would dare bring some crumbs into this party. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, we can't get crumbs.  I didn't see that coming.  Crumbs is not bad.  Yeah.  He's the rudest guest.  That's right.  But Roland's the rudest...  You didn't have any of that fucking red velvet cake.  It was good.  That was really tasty.  Yeah, for a pedestrian palate, maybe.  Oh!  Not for you.  I will be very honest.  Sophisticated.  I enjoyed the...  I probably need to have another one.  I thought it was tasty, but I didn't love it.  It wasn't a bad dessert, but I didn't love it.  You wouldn't wait on a lot for it?  No, because other stuff are good, like the DKA.  The DKA is amazing.  Phenomenal. 
[01:46:30]  I've had one of those.  Yeah, I mean, he's got desserts that are probably better than the cronut, but the cronut  is the thing that took off because of the name of it and all that shit.  It's a pop culture phenomenon.  It certainly is.  But he really does have amazing other things.  Mrs. Roberts wanted a souffle, so I gave her one, and she took off with one.  Yeah, and then he goes, well, I gave your wife a souffle, and she's not rude.  And I go, yeah, she didn't bring it from home and then refused to share it with the rest  of the party.  That's true.  It's not rude to take it.  No, no.  People ask me, can I have a piece?  I would know, but it's delicious.  Oh, that's so rude. 
[01:47:00]  Isn't that rude?  His, like, foodiness and food addiction has gotten to a whole other level lately.  Like, he is so condescending and picky and insulting about other people's food.  Yeah, everybody else is a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Now, I heard, I saw Who Kid brought some Cristal, but drank it out of paper cups with ice in  it.  Yes, that's true.  That's true.  That's like, I hate to say what that is.  There's a certain word. 
[01:47:30]  That's why I tried it.  Well, you could use that also, I guess.  Radio edit.  Yes.  There he is.  Who Kid drinking out of a paper coffee cup.  Right.  With some ice cubes in it.  Popping bottles with some ice cubes.  All right.  Stal on ice.  Yeah, that's not how you're supposed to do that, I don't think.  But, all right.  How did, um, and I heard when he came in, he's like, what's up, niggas?  And the Nagel family was horrified.  Yeah, there's a lot of, uh, let's just say, like, almost mafioso-style Italians there. 
[01:48:00]  And he goes, what up, niggas, as he walks into the house, and there's just, uh.  I just thought it was a home invasion.  I didn't see any mafia-oso type of folks.  Uh-oh.  You didn't?  Yeah, there's three of them.  They were sitting off to the side.  In the dining room.  Drinking their rosé.  You don't think there's any mob in the Nagel family, Sam?  I didn't notice any, any names.  I didn't think Nagel's a pimp.  Mob ties.  Yes.  He never could have out-eaten to tell you.  There might have been some people. 
[01:48:30]  There's a horse's ass left in the bed.  That was clever.  We could put the dessert behind the toilet.  The Nagel fucking mafia.  There might have been some people of Italian descent.  That's great.  But I didn't, I didn't, nobody struck me as having mafia-type.  But they're not going to, like, make it obvious, Sam.  I mean, a hint. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, I don't see them as being, uh, a mafia-type of, uh, family.  No?  The Nagels?  No, not at all.  Not my family.  Oh!  You're implying that there's some, uh, I married the mob-type stuff.  You married into the mob.  You're like, get about it.  Yeah, you're like Carlo.  Wow.  I wish it would end the same way.  I certainly do, too.  Kicking out his windshield.  They'd choke him with a hoagie. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  He was quite the scene, Who Kid?  When he walked in, his pants were sagging, and he was yelling N-words, and he was holding  four bottles up in the air.  Right, right.  He bought Cristal and Moet.  Quite an entrance.  No bitches, though.  He didn't have any bitches with him.  Troy brought the bitches.  I heard Troy brought the bitches.  Troy absolutely brought the bitches.  Troy brought the bitches.  That's pretty good.  The bitches.  How are they?  I heard two bitches were making out in the fucking kitchen or something.  I didn't see any of that.  Yeah, we saw that. 
[01:50:00]  We didn't see no bitches making out.  Well, look, there was a little bit.  Who Kidded Me at one point decided that we were going to try to make the party look a  lot more exciting on Instagram than it was at the time.  Okay, right, right.  I was looking going, that looks like a fun fucking party.  Right.  That's why we started dancing in small, small Instagram camera-sized groups.  I wanted to see when the camera moved a little.  I didn't see people on the peripheral edges of the...  And I did no dancing.  And we just got...  No.  Two girls.  You just chilled.  I did.  We got the two girls there to put their faces close together. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, okay.  And then angled it.  Everybody thought it was a blast, though.  Kind of a perspective thing.  Yeah.  Okay.  It was cool.  I went in there.  I had some fucking red velvet cake and went back into the kitchen.  Jimmy ate very well.  Jimmy ate very well until the last 30 minutes of the party.  Oh, yeah.  I knew I would be bad.  He had a breakdown.  Jim walked in.  He had a breakdown.  Jim walked in the door.  He was doing amazingly well for...  Baby carrots?  Three and a half hours prior.  No, some chicken, a little bit of pasta.  And I had some cake and cookies. 
[01:51:00]  Aw.  Why not have a cheat day?  It's like...  Thank you.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  I've got to punish myself.  I know.  It sounds good.  It sounds like a fun time.  It was fun.  Yeah.  It was nice.  It was enjoyable.  It was enjoyable chat.  Yeah.  To see the Nagels in action.  A nice home.  Yeah.  How's the Nagel Mansion?  It's a great basement if you're an Oompa Loompa.  Oh, no.  It's fucking four feet high.  Oh, no.  It's also full of toys, so it is really like...  Does it look like a child's playroom?  Yes.  You know what's the craziest thing I ever saw?  Uh-oh. 
[01:51:30]  He's got this giant DVD shelf, right?  Yeah.  It's like two walls full, and it's awesome.  I've got a big DVD collection myself, but half the DVDs are turned sideways.  And I go, Eric, what does it mean when they're turned sideways?  And he goes, those are the ones I want to watch.  And how many are there?  Like, dozens and dozens.  Oh, my God.  He's going through his collection.  Like, I've got to make a point to watch that.  Turn that sideways.  To watch that.  He's got a little system.  He's got a system.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  I like that.  So you remember to watch them.  Of course.  You remember to watch them.  That means you have too many if you don't remember to watch them.  Exactly.  Right.  And then what about the ones that you don't want to watch?  Why have them?  Oh, they're already gone.  If I didn't want them, they're not in there.  So what?  You're watching them and then deciding if you should keep it after you watch it again?  Everything on that wall there, I'm keeping.  But the sideways ones, though.  Why keep any DVDs at this point?  You're still full of Terry.  Yeah.  I'm glad you picked up on that.  I am so dishing every single DVD in the near future.  I pop everything on the hard drive now.  Except for kids' movies for the car. 
[01:52:30]  Everything goes on my little hard drive entertainment system.  Hard drive hits?  Hard drive hits.  And I just pop it up.  There it is.  All right.  Nice.  It was a good time, though.  Wow.  You missed a good time.  I missed it.  There you go.  It was definitely an average time.  Amazing.  You think average?  Yeah.  I enjoyed it.  Eric, you did a good job.  He knows how to throw a party.  He takes care of everybody.  Yeah.  The chicken was good.  Pasta was tasty.  He kind of knew what everyone was into.  Oh, my God.  The desserts were okay. 
[01:53:00]  I mean, like, I didn't...  I'll tell you what was good.  The chocolate chip cookies were really good.  And the...  The cronuts were good.  I only had...  I didn't have any cronuts.  Oh, no.  Kenny.  Kenny's got something to say.  I was holding back, but I'll say it.  All right.  There was a lot of pissed off people at that party.  Whoa.  Why?  What kind of soft drinks were there?  You're right, Kenny.  What happened?  No soft drinks?  No.  Let Mr. Nagel explain. 
[01:53:30]  Mr. Nagel?  There was soda and juice.  What kind of soda?  Diet soda?  Exactly.  That's it?  Yeah.  There was no regular soda.  You didn't have any standard issue Coke or...  No, because no one drinks it.  Yes, they do.  No, we don't.  Yes, they do.  I was looking for some.  Kenny was not.  I wanted a Coke.  Diet Coke.  I was going to celebrate with a sugary beverage.  Right.  Coke Zero.  So I got to go for your bleachy one.  All right.  Let's go. 
[01:54:00]  He's ready to...  Just diet soda.  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  Did you hear the great story Kenny and I told about sharing Dr. Peppers?  Yeah.  It wasn't diet Dr. Peppers.  Yeah.  No.  What's the first three letters of diet?  Very good.  That's terrific.  That's tragic.  It's amazing.  Yeah, E-Rock, you got to have regular and diet when you're having a party.  That's a faux pas right there.  Yeah, I didn't want to burst everybody's bubble.  Oh, man.  There was a lot of pissed off people. 
[01:54:30]  I'm sorry, most people were drinking real drinks.  Ah, that's right.  We focused more on that than we did on the...  Well, I mean, all right, if you want everybody to just drive drunk home...  Yeah, excuse me for being spiritual.  Spiritual.  Kenny, that's not how he believes that.  Spiritual.  Nobody's talking about that.  I've got an argument.  No.  No.  All right.  That's great.  Thanks for inviting me.  Did you mean that to be resentful-sounding? 
[01:55:00]  No, I loved the meatballs.  Oh, they were good?  Yeah, the meatballs were good.  Well, they have to be, because the Italian mafia family making meatballs.  I treated myself to one chocolate chip cookie.  Oh, you wanted to say that.  You did.  Jimmy's head turned around.  No, just hearing Kenny ate a cookie, I thought it was good.  What did you have to drink with it?  Oh, boy.  I had a bottle of Poland Spring water.  Diet water?  That's not a treat at all.  Well, there wasn't no regular soda. 
[01:55:30]  Even for the drinks?  Like, you had to put diet soda in.  Like, if I would have been at this party and wanted a Captain and Coke, I would have had  a Captain and Diet Coke?  I was thinking of you.  Oh, that's terrible.  It's like, thank God Anthony didn't drive two hours for this shit.  Put your diet soda.  Man, that would have pissed me off.  I think you're being a very ungrateful guest, Kenny.  It was a lovely affair.  I would have mouthed off if there weren't so many mafiosa around, I bet, right?  Yeah.  I wrote him a gracious thank you email.  They probably looked at you like you were McCluskey. 
[01:56:00]  Well, people were wondering why Kenny wouldn't take his jacket off.  Whoa!  Okay, Eric, that's the wrong question to ask.  Oh, shit.  His superhero jacket.  Sam knows the answer to that question.  Well, there's two reasons.  He had a bra on under it.  Had a bro.  I'm going to go with the gun.  No.  I had my shirt out.  My shirt was untucked.  Eric, I think Kenny...  Why don't you take your jacket off?  Kenny didn't want to say it because he didn't want to be an ungracious guest.  Pissed on the front of your pants? 
[01:56:30]  No, no, no.  He didn't trust your family to not steal his jacket.  Oh.  Or he was ready to leave at any time.  Oh, boy.  Well, that mob in the house...  I guess I'm...  He thought a hit might go down.  Did your mafia relatives get nervous because Kenny looked like a cop?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're doing some big deals.  Besides, I had the most famous jacket at the party.  Forget about that.  But someone wasn't offered to take their jacket.  That is not true.  Oh, shit.  That's why you left it on?  Like, may I take your coat?  Yeah.  Do you know what happened? 
[01:57:00]  That's class.  Was that a Dyson jacket?  Yeah.  It was a gift.  No kidding.  And then...  Oh, wow.  I keep my jacket on because...  You know what happens to jackets at parties, right?  They get thrown out the window and into trees.  No, no.  Someone rubs their asshole on them?  Yes.  Close, Jim.  They get thrown on a bed upstairs in a bedroom.  Yes.  And then some lucky person goes home with a jizz stain on their coat.  Who's fucking on the coats? 
[01:57:30]  Who doesn't try to?  Kenny was trying to all night with the girls that Troy brought.  Oh, that's got to be a thing now.  You got to jizz on one coat.  That's a party.  You don't even need a lucky lady.  Just fucking jack off onto the...  Just jack off on the fucking coats on the bed.  Right.  Yeah.  That shows you care.  Wow.  Well, you could have put it in a closet somewhere. 
[01:58:00]  Kenny was...  Hung it up.  Believe me, I tried to put it in a lot of places, but...  The real reason is Kenny was insulted that nobody asked him.  Right.  Because I was there when he got there, and nobody asked him to take his coat.  May I take your coat, sir?  Right.  And then not long after he got there, Jim Norton arrived.  Oh.  And right in front of Kenny's face, while Kenny was wearing his coat, Jim was asked,  can I take your coat?  Wow.  That's an insult.  Kenny immediately picked up on it, obviously, and told me... 
[01:58:30]  Was this done on purpose, Iraq Common?  No.  Nothing was done on purpose.  You know what it was?  It was all that mob influence.  They didn't want to help out the fuzz.  Fucking police.  Yeah.  What...  Who took your coat, though, Jimmy?  I think it was Ange.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  All right.  Hmm.  Someone just tweeted me, said that Dane Cook has a bit on shitting on all the coats  as they're on the bed.  Oh, God.  Shitting on...  Is it a short bit?  Jesus. 
[01:59:00]  I don't know.  Maybe he'll tell it at Patrice's benefit.  Oh, maybe.  Tickets still available?  A little bit, but it's almost...  I was looking yesterday.  Yeah, it's almost still there.  Yeah, the second annual Patrice O'Neal benefit is going down February 18th, and we got  some tickets available.  It's at the New York City Center.  There are tickets available at new...  Well, let me do it this way.  Tickets available at nycitycenter.org, okay?  nycitycenter.org, and I believe we also have a link on our Facebook page, which is Opie  and Anthony, and it's... 
[01:59:30]  Wow.  It's David Tell, Nick DiPaolo, Colin Quinn, Jim Norton, Dane Cook, Bill Burr, Rich Voss,  Bonnie McFarlane, Robert Kelly, Talent, Big Jay Oakerson, Harrison Stanton, and I believe  Keith Robinson needs to be added to our list here.  Yeah.  And Talent, as well.  Talent's on here, yeah.  And Keith Robinson.  How come we can get Shaquille O'Neal in the studio again?  We had a great time.  Yes, right across the street.  It's fucked.  Get him to float over here.  I would love to.  He's here all the time, too, in New York.  Talk to him about that fucking floating balloon shack. 
[02:00:00]  That'd be great.  He's wearing the shack balloon clothes, too.  Shack balloon, wow.  Just look at him with Christy.  Holy shit.  He's very tall, that shack.  I don't think I'm going out on a limb saying that.  He's endorsing Christy, I guess, if anybody gives a flying fuck who he endorses.  He's already starting the endorsement thing?  Well, yeah.  I guess he's back.  It's a little early, right?  Chris Christy.  It says for New Jersey youths.  Youths? 
[02:00:30]  Toys for twats.  Isn't that funny?  I like that.  Yeah.  I don't know why we don't get Shaq back.  We loved him.  Yeah.  He kind of liked...  No, not even kind of.  He definitely liked his time on our show.  All right, we're going to play this in a break.  We'll continue with some shit.  Here's another way to be remembered.  Again, in this one, this is more personal.  It's more for you because nobody's ever going to know that it was you, but you'll know,  and that's all that matters.  Next time you go to a party, a great big party,  go into the room where all the coats are, 
[02:01:00]  shit on the coats.  Guaranteed, at some point, somebody's going to walk out of that room and go,  someone shit on the coats.  Someone has shit on the coats.  That's the only thing you can say when someone shits on the coats.  Someone shit on the coats.  They might say, I think someone shit on the coats, but you know. 
[02:01:30]  You're just afraid to be the bearer of bad news.  I think someone may have shit on or around the coat area.  There's a smell of shit around the perimeter, the vicinity of coats.  Leading me to believe someone has shit.  But again, you're there.  You're there watching it all happen.  And it's your job.  All you're going to do at some point, you're going to lean in and go, 
[02:02:00]  what?  And then blend back into the crowd.  What?  I hope it wasn't on my coat.  And then boom, you're a phantom.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  Disappear.  The OPNMD Show.  Continues in moments.  And now these messages. 
[02:02:30]  Turning into a snow day around here at SiriusXM.  Oh, everybody was looking out the window.  Right.  Checking out the snow.  I bumped into Dennis Falcone by the window as we were looking at snow.  And he said, he suggested, he goes, hey, you guys going to do any school closings because  of the storm?  Well, let's get Dennis in here.  I think it's a snow radio company.  I think it's a good day to have Dennis in here, no?  Not a good day.  Why?  Is it Saturday or Sunday?  Well, we need to know how to handle a snow day on a radio show. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, because he, and he relayed a story to me about him saying that, just don't go  to work on a snow day once.  And he got in trouble.  He got suspended.  Why?  Because he got on the air when it was snowing and said, hey, it's snowing.  Everybody, just don't go to work.  And I guess he got in trouble because he told people not to go to work.  And that wasn't, uh, wasn't accurate.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Damn Dennis.  He was a shock shock back in the day, I guess, giving inaccurate fucking snow closings.  Now that I know he busted both ankles, it's really awkward to see him walk.  Look.  Oh, I know.  Everything is obvious now.  Fucking pigeon feet.  Fawn legs.  Fawn legs.  Dennis.  Dennis Falcone.  We got a snow day here at SiriusXM.  A memo went out saying, use your discretion, meaning I guess we could go home if we want.  Look at his Walt Disney fucking racist mustache. 
[02:04:00]  Yes, that's exactly.  That's a great mustache for a juke, Boeing.  You anti-Semitic mustache-wearing motherfucker.  Dennis Falcone.  What do you mean not on air, guys?  Not on air personnel.  What?  Why?  Don't we?  No, because we're here to broadcast.  Yeah, but what?  We could drive much.  We.  When is that?  Although, I did hear, Denny, last night on 60s on 6, I heard you played What's New Pussycat?  Tom Jones.  By Tom Jones.  And then you played some obscure fucking Neil Diamond song instead of one of the hits. 
[02:04:30]  What movie?  It might have been something we exhumed from the groovyard of your mind.  What?  Groovyard of your mind.  It might have been a lost hit.  What movie is that song featured in?  That was in the...  What's New Pussycat?  That was the title song.  Title song for the movie, the James Bond movie.  Jamie Bond.  No.  No.  Woody Allen.  I think it was a cartoon movie.  Turbo.  No.  Turbo?  It's Turbo.  It's Turbo.  That's some fun movie trivia.  And they got some cool hip-hop song called Saturday Night I love. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Look it up.  Turbo, YouTube, full soundtrack.  I like Saturday Night by the Bay City Rollers.  Do ya?  Good song.  Not a good song.  A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  Night.  B-A-Y.  Night.  That's right.  You go to that second...  Chant.  B-A-Y.  Second down.  Yeah, I know.  Go there.  Now you see all the songs listed?  You like this song, yeah?  Go to Saturday Night.  Now you have to go to...  Get the fucking rules.  No, just click on that. 
[02:05:30]  Saturday Night.  Saturday Night.  All right.  Enough of the Saturday Night.  This is the best song for Turbo.  Look at this.  I love this song.  It's in turbo.  It's by Azamatli.  It's a catchy little drop.  A little orchestral drop sound.  Fuck Rebecca Black. 
[02:06:00]  This is the Saturday song you need to be listening to.  Why can't you do more?  Imagine waking up.  All right, then it gets stupid.  Sounds like Linkin Park.  Yeah.  Does it?  What?  You don't like them?  No.  You don't like that song?  No.  Why?  It sounds dated.  It's not.  It sounds very...  Maybe it's an old song.  I don't know.  It sounds very 2002 to me.  Oh, wow.  Look out.  Excuse me, Sam Roberts.  Everybody Ride the Train from...  What was that movie?  Oh, boy.  Everybody Ride the Train.  Oh, boy.  I know that movie.  I wish you were in front of us. 
[02:06:30]  That's a little nice.  Exactly.  I wish you were on it 20 years ago yesterday.  I wish you were coming from Poughkeepsie last weekend.  Everyone got their little train bashing in.  Dennis, Malcolm.  Dennis, Malcolm.  You can pile up on the highway.  Dennis, how do you handle a snow day on the radio?  Yes.  And I don't understand why the on-air people can't go home either, because we have to drive  through this shit, too.  Yeah, what are we?  You're here to deliver it, though.  You guys are here.  That's part of our job.  That's part of being a broadcaster.  But if we know how to drive the snow, then the other... 
[02:07:00]  Staying in a radio station all day, doing those long shifts and getting the closings  on.  Are we better at driving than the fucking people that work in the offices?  Right.  We're here already.  We're here already.  No, they're telling everyone else to go home.  That they could have left.  But we can't go home?  No.  So we're going to risk our lives?  We're a different breed.  We're here.  For dick jokes?  Yeah, we'll get some food catered in, and maybe get a hotel room.  All right.  So get a caterer or killed.  That's right.  Whoever brings in the food will get killed on their way home, because we wanted to sit  around and give boring school closings.  Just staying on the air all day, you know, like from 6 to 6, doing the closings. 
[02:07:30]  Okay, let's do it for alphabetical order.  Now, I remember in the day, as they called it, I would gather around the radio and listen  for my school, and they would give the school closings.  What a great feeling when they said your school was closed.  It was great.  And the Elwood School District is, and I'd be like, oh, oh, the Elwood School, that's  us.  And we'd go, yay.  And then we'd go out and play.  Yeah.  In the snow.  It was great.  Sadly, radio does, they put it all on the internet. 
[02:08:00]  It's not sadly.  Exactly.  They've lost their...  When it's closed in your area, it's pretty safe to say all the...  If they start announcing school's closing, pretty safe to say yours is closed.  Most schools, and I'm sure your children's school, they'll probably send you an email  or a text.  Yeah.  That's good enough.  Now you'd get that.  You'd get a mass text, right?  Something like that.  It is a good thing.  It's technology.  But it takes away something that the broadcaster used to do.  One-on-one communication.  Oh, that fucking yes.  That communication that you're a friend.  It makes the radio guy even more obscure and useless. 
[02:08:30]  Thank you.  Useless.  St. Ignatius Pre-K.  Obsolete and, yeah.  Canceling today.  All after-school activities canceled in the Longwood High School District.  I'm offering classes in my house.  Oh, is that it?  Your school's open.  Sure.  Pre-K only.  Oh, good.  So young.  I'm doing extra traffic reports and extra weather reports.  Can we go back to the school thing?  Sure.  Because you reminded me of something.  Go ahead.  I got an email from my son's school.  Oh.  You know the whole PC thing we talk about?  Uh-huh.  So far there has been no Halloween celebrated at school. 
[02:09:00]  They weren't allowed to wear costumes.  They're three and a half.  Costumes.  That's their world.  Costumes on Halloween.  Oh, yeah.  Thanksgiving they kind of ate together, but there was no acknowledgement that was a Thanksgiving thing.  Right.  And then this came in.  Hi, all.  With the holidays approaching, we were asked to remind you of the gift policy from the school handbook.  Oh, sounds exciting.  The gift policy from the school handbook.  And I quote.  What is the gift policy? 
[02:09:30]  I forgot, sir.  And I quote.  Yes.  This is right out of the handbook.  Gifts can foster competition among the children.  What?  Oh, God.  And are not suitable in our school.  Oh, fuck.  What?  I might have picked the wrong school, I'm starting to think.  Wow.  Because I...  Most of them probably like this, dude.  No, I talked to somebody in the Harborfield School District, which...  Competition.  That's where I came from.  They're like, all the holidays are alive and well in the classrooms.  Foster competition among the children are not suitable in our school. 
[02:10:00]  If students wish to thank their teachers, a picture or other homemade projects are always welcome.  As are thank you letters, notes from parents expressing their appreciation.  Please do not bring any individual gift to your child's teachers or staff at winter break, year end, or any other time during the school year.  End of year, gifts are coordinated through class reps.  Jesus.  Oh, that sounds fun.  The general rule of thumb and philosophy on gifts...  Rule of thumb is up to the fucking knuckle. 
[02:10:30]  Is that...  When you shove it up an ass, I guess.  Oh, good one.  Is that it's the sentiment that counts, not the product.  Well, then why care about the competition?  How about you teach that value to the children instead of fucking saying, don't bring in gifts?  How about you fucking do your jobs and teach that to the children?  I don't...  I mean, I like taking care of the teachers because I understand they don't make anything.  Keep it fair, huh?  Keep it fair.  My son's going to a pretty good school, and I know they aren't making that much money.  So, yeah, just...  I was just going to throw them $100, like, gift cards for Starbucks or something. 
[02:11:00]  There's four teachers in the classroom.  Here, here, here, here.  Thank you so much.  You'll go to school jail for that.  No kidding.  It's very illegal.  The kids don't line up, like in the movie Goodfellas.  They line up, give them a booster.  Give you a little...  Give the gift to the teachers.  We used to do that in school.  Denny.  Used to line up.  Denny.  And drop off a gift.  We don't know what you're talking about, Denny.  Nice.  Where's the competition, though?  Well, the kids, one kid will bring in a big gift, and it's just...  Yeah, the poor kids can't afford to get nice gifts.  No poor kids are in the school, though.  Now the teacher's going to like...  No, there are. 
[02:11:30]  The teacher's going to like him better, because he got a good gift, and...  Oh, okay.  They have scholarships.  Enough.  Send them to a nice private parochial school.  Well, Secret Santa, right, Denny?  Yeah.  If I knew the teachers were being well taken care of, then whatever.  But I know.  They're young teachers.  It's just...  Young, dumb.  Full of cum.  Look, it's a dumb fucking policy.  It takes...  Unbelievable.  They're taking away all of these events that, like... 
[02:12:00]  As you remember, when you were a kid, all those events were fun.  Right.  They made, like...  You looked forward to things.  They were fun as a kid.  It was exciting.  And they're fucking taking all that shit away.  And I don't mind that my kid is going to be disappointed.  That's part of life.  That is dad.  All right.  You guys laughed a little too hard that way.  It's not funny, Denny. 
[02:12:30]  It's a little funny.  It's a little funny.  Wow.  But there's...  He's got to learn disappointment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't protect your kids like that.  Does he wear a uniform for school?  Hell no.  Does he ever walk in...  Shut up.  Can he wear, like, a Santa Claus t-shirt?  Can he walk in wearing a Santa...  Shut up.  What if you wore a t-shirt that said Merry Christmas?  That's a good question.  Or a walk in wearing a little Santa cap.  Could he wear a Santa Claus t-shirt?  That's a costume.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  I don't think so. 
[02:13:00]  I don't think so.  There's no hint that Christmas is here in this classroom.  No little decorations or anything.  That's fucked, man.  And I just thought it was still early.  But I guess it's not early.  We're, what, two weeks out?  Yeah, it's not early at all.  Fuck me to remember.  It's so weird to me.  Such fond memories.  There's no balance whatsoever in the thinking.  No.  It's unbelievable.  That's not nice.  It's not right.  It doesn't break up the year into, like...  How do you break up the year, then, into, like, little things?  Because I remember it was, you know, you'd have Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. 
[02:13:30]  And those are the things you looked forward to as a kid.  And there was a lot that went around that.  Yes.  It broke up the school year.  You're right.  Valentine's Day.  We've talked about that before, how disappointed you were when you didn't get the Valentine.  And, you know...  I never got the good one.  Of course.  You never got one?  I didn't get the one from the girl I liked.  Ever?  No, I got the generic ones.  What about the boy you liked?  I got the generic ones.  Generic, yeah.  The boy I liked, he was going to give me Valentine's, but he had two broken legs. 
[02:14:00]  Danny and his broken legs.  Now that you told us, it's very obvious when you walk that your legs were snapped.  Yeah, well, yeah, you said that once.  You said, look at him wobbling down the hall.  Yeah, you walk like a fucking marionette is controlling you.  But you didn't know that's okay.  James Caan in misery.  Exactly.  I wish it was him and the godfather.  Oh, did you also make the apple, the little apples for Thanksgiving?  The turkey apples?  We used to take apples.  Yeah, you used to hollow it out a little bit. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, you cut it.  You fuck it.  No, no.  You used to put the toothpicks and make the legs out of the apple in the turkey.  Little gumdrops and everything.  Oh, gumdrops.  They don't do anything.  Turkey apples.  Oh, what?  Why not?  Turkey apples.  Threw it out there.  I love it.  No one likes a turkey apple.  No.  But we would do the little turkey hand drawing.  You put your hand there to make the turkey.  That's hacked, though.  That was hacked.  Yeah.  They're still doing that one.  Not in my son's school, but we did it at home.  Well, of course not.  It's illegal.  What do they call the apples that are fucking cow shit or horse shit? 
[02:15:00]  What?  Macintosh?  No.  Oh, road apples.  Road apples.  Oh, road apples.  Make a turkey out of that.  A road apple turkey?  Yeah.  Put your nose into it and twist it.  No gifts, though.  What the fuck is going on?  That's fucked up.  Exactly.  No gift for your teacher.  That's so fucked up.  Exactly.  I always wanted to bring my teacher gift.  Can't you just sit down to the parents and go out?  This school might not be for you, then, if you can't handle the fact that a parent brought 
[02:15:30]  in a nice gift for a teacher that obviously isn't making a lot of money.  It wasn't even going to be anything crazy.  It was just going to be a little thank you here.  Yeah.  Imagine if their notes said gifts, but to only the white teachers?  Yes.  It is fucked up.  I mean...  It's horrible.  I don't like it.  I've got to figure it out.  I remember bringing your Christmas presents into school after Christmas break.  Yep.  Take your favorite one and bring it in.  Fucking play with it in school.  Show off how great you did. 
[02:16:00]  Shit got stolen.  Did it?  Didn't we?  Yeah.  I can never bring anything in.  My shit always got stolen.  Because you went to one of those schools.  Didn't we bring in gifts to the classrooms?  Yes.  Yeah.  Secret Santa?  Didn't we have like Secret Santas in class?  Grab Bag.  Grab Bag.  Grab Bag.  That's what it was.  Okay.  We absolutely had that.  It was just called...  Okay.  Yeah.  I played my own version of Grab Bag.  With your mouth.  The Secret Santa is when you put your name... 
[02:16:30]  Everybody puts their name in a big box and you pull out a name.  Everybody knows what a Secret Santa is.  Jim didn't know what it was.  You know what a Secret Santa is?  We know what a Secret Santa is.  A Grab Bag was when you had the big fucking Santa bag.  Yeah.  And you'd put your gifts in there and kids would just reach in.  You really can't just grab it.  And there was a girl one and a guy one.  There'd always be one weird one.  Yeah.  Like a fucking mouth tumor all wrapped up.  It was the worst.  Smell it.  It was terrible.  Because you get like shitty stuff and some kids would get good stuff. 
[02:17:00]  It was shitty.  They shouldn't have done that.  No.  Because it kind of taught you, you know, it sucked.  But who cared?  Because, you know, it was Christmas at home.  I didn't believe half this shit was actually going on until I got my kid in school.  I'll probably wear a Santa hat to the Christmas party here on Thursday.  It's not a Christmas party.  What's it called?  Holiday gathering.  Holiday gathering.  Santa cap or something.  That sounds offensive.  Why can't they call it Christmas around here?  Because they don't want stupid to wear a Santa hat. 
[02:17:30]  It's a gathering of the Dillitoes.  But who would actually get offended if they called it the Christmas party here?  I don't think anybody.  I mean, I don't think Jewish people care about having a Christmas party.  They're just like, okay, free booze.  Yeah, we'll go to the Christmas party.  Sorry, ours became the number one thing.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'm not saying the religion, but I'm saying Christmas trumps the Hanukkah thing.  Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, and the rest of them.  All the XM people have to go to the Christmas party at the Sirius compound. 
[02:18:00]  Sirius became the thing.  Exactly.  Ramadan.  Ramadan.  Ramadan.  It's not around this time.  Ramadan.  What did your Santa hat say on it?  No.  Yeah, just the Santa hat.  Doesn't it have your name on it?  Denny?  No.  D-O-U-C.  Doesn't say kill me on it?  Have a nice Santa Claus tie.  It's a Santa Claus tie.  I hope you're starting to do something.  I can't wait to see those Santas upside down with the tides.  Aren't you going to wear a red shirt to the party on Thursday?  Get festive.  Hope he gets caught in the elevator.  You'll be having a good time. 
[02:18:30]  Ramadan happens in the summer.  How great about June?  Oh, Denny.  I thought there was a holiday celebration this time of year.  Suspend it again.  No.  No, Kwanzaa.  God damn, are you offensive, Denny.  Good gosh.  I'll have to give them a holiday.  It's like, I don't know.  They're all the same to me.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  She looks really...  Wow.  Oh, my God.  They're partying.  Like, it's 1999 over there in Johannesburg.  I guess no one has to go to work over there.  It's not snowing. 
[02:19:00]  It's a national holiday.  Yeah, it's a national holiday type deal.  Other news, we're following the...  Carol!  That's Carol, everyone.  Is that Carol?  Yes, that's Carol.  Chad.  Would you let me finish?  Let me finish.  Oh.  Chad.  Chad.  Chad.  Well, if you let me talk, Carol.  Now, the pressure was at...  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to...  Well, now we've got to hear it again.  Oh, God.  My best part is when she goes, I was just joking.  He goes, I know.  I was only joking. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, no, he said I was joking.  But the storm was 902 billibars.  Billibars.  902 was the lowest that you had with this storm a couple of hours ago.  So it has filled in a little bit, filled in with some air.  Okay, so, Chad.  Chad.  But, Camille.  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol.  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would let me talk.  Oh.  Camille.  Camille was 908.  And so this is actually now not as strong as Camille, but not really as strong as it's been. 
[02:20:00]  908.  I'm walking over here because you're, I can have this chart, but it's not in front of me.  His confidence has been shot.  908 millibars.  It was flustered.  That fucking ball cutter, Carol.  26.81 inches of mercury.  I watch her enough to know she's a twat.  This storm got down to 26.61.  He's just thinking, this is boring, people.  This is boring, people.  And right now it's 26.98.  Now, if you would go to your home barometer that you have, it's probably a big deal.  It's a big circle hanging on your wall that you've got from an uncle's home barometer.  No, it's not.  No one has that anymore.  You go, look at that.  That is completely off the screen. 
[02:20:30]  Rarely would you ever have to have a barometer that would go that low in the northern hemisphere,  unless you were obviously trying to get under a hurricane.  All right.  Thank you, Chad.  All right.  Just having fun.  No, you weren't.  Just having fun.  That was a moment.  You hate each other.  Nah, that's just having fun.  See, that wasn't fun.  See, Carol is a twat, and Chad jerks off to the weather.  Right.  So it was like a perfect storm.  Yes.  Literally.  And figuratively.  Exactly.  Yes.  You ever jerk off to the weather, Denny?  No.  No. 
[02:21:00]  What do you jerk off to, Denny?  I'd rather not discuss that here on the radio, because I don't work blue.  I've discussed this with you before.  One time we gave Denny a porno mag that we got in the office,  and he said it was a little something for him to look at while he was on the train.  And he implied that he was going to go into the bathroom on the train and masturbate.  No, no, no.  So you get boners on the train?  No, I'm not looking at a porn magazine on the train.  That was the implication of that statement, though.  I gave it to one of the guys who worked here.  You didn't jerk off on the train?  No, of course not.  I heard you unwittingly used Denny as part of one of your ploys to screw over EROC. 
[02:21:30]  When?  Oh, yesterday, when you made me open the box.  Don't say me.  Yes, you did.  You were cackling in there.  What a great gimmick.  No, no, no.  This was not me.  Hey, Denny, come on in here.  You've got a box.  We've got a box for you.  Apparently EROC.  Remember with the Steiner Sports thing?  Right.  Well, a package came for EROC.  From Steiner Sports?  Yes.  What?  And he wasn't here yesterday.  He had talked to them into it, I guess. 
[02:22:00]  Okay.  And so Roland and Sal called him and asked if they could open it.  Yeah.  And Eric said no.  No.  And then Roland said, well, let me get somebody to open it.  And Eric said no.  And then Roland got me in the office and tried to get me to open it.  But I said, no, Eric's going to know.  Regardless of what we make up, Eric's going to know that I did on purpose because I fucked  with him all the time.  And so then Roland, this is brilliant, called Denny in and said, hey, Denny, I got some 
[02:22:30]  beats for you.  I got some headphones in this box.  And I knew he was joking.  I thought it'd be like snakes jumping out of the can or something kooky like that.  It's fun like that, right?  From 1960s.  Exactly.  Or some porn stuff or something phallic to jump out of the box.  You know.  And I said, okay.  And you said, no, but I like it in my can.  I'm ripping open the box.  Sam is in tears.  Well, I don't think any of us actually thought that Denny was going to open the box because 
[02:23:00]  Eric's name was on it.  No, I didn't see it because he was holding the box down.  No, he was holding the box.  Roland was holding the box.  They made him open the box.  But Denny walks in and just starts.  It's a pair of magic shoes.  So you opened up Eric's box.  That's not cool.  I didn't know it was Eric's box.  He just starts tearing it open.  What was it?  What was it?  It's a baseball.  And they go, oh.  And then they said, oh.  But it wasn't a Rivera ball.  It was just a Steiner sport.  I don't know.  I haven't looked through it yet.  But Denny, I could tell you the contents.  He went through it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Once it was opened. 
[02:23:30]  Is it signed?  No.  I said, oh, it's a baseball.  And then they told me what it was.  That's it.  He broke the law.  Tampering with federal.  Wait, what?  No, no, no.  It's not federal property.  Oh, shit.  The mail?  Yes, it is.  Oh, boy.  It's true.  I mean, the mail is federal.  Why would he be taking 800 pictures?  Because he knew he was going to set me up.  He was going to set me up.  And you opened a package that wasn't addressed to you.  You think Roland set you up?  Of course he did.  Oh, shit.  Him and Sal and you were in on a tour.  It never ends. 
[02:24:00]  You guys were all in cahoots.  It never fucking ends.  Cahoots.  Denny, all right.  You were great.  All right, Denny.  And you got in trouble, Denny, once for one of your snow announcements?  Oh, yeah.  It was many, many, many years ago.  And it was just briefly snowing.  And people were calling up.  And I said, you know what?  It's Monday.  It's snowing.  Let's go home.  Let's close everything.  And somebody at the courts heard that and thought it was official.  Oh, what a dummy.  Yeah, and they didn't open an office.  And they said the guy on the radio.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  So they actually suspended you?  Yeah, I got suspended.  How long?  A week.  Or a shock shock.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  It's crazy.  Without pay?  Yeah.  For a week?  For a week.  Oh, Jesus.  With 125 clams for the company.  Really?  Yeah.  I think it was two of your week back then.  So.  You can't just do crazy stuff like that.  Well.  Announce somebody's dead or something.  Oh, that's just fucking.  That's completely insane.  You got to draw the line in the same sum.  You see what he did there, right?  I saw what he did there.  Took a little shot at us.  Oh, yeah, he did.  No, it's not a shot.  A little shot.  Yeah, it was a little shot.  It's all right.  The old mayor.  We took our little shots.  We took our little shots.  But you guys were young. 
[02:25:00]  You guys were young.  You were like, what, 29 maybe back then?  Uh-huh.  Oh, more sarcasm.  Oh.  Oh, and then he sets his sights on you.  I know.  Somebody is feeling comfortable.  I got to get back.  I got work to do on the holiday channel.  No, the holiday channel's set.  It's all done.  Oh, no, no.  We got guest DJs and stuff coming in.  Yeah, who?  Sam is rude.  I got a big red nose.  Kevin Cronin of REO Speedwagon.  Wow.  It's a Cronin Little Christmas this weekend.  He's going to be playing the hits.  What's he going to do?  He's going to be playing some of his favorite holiday songs, Christmas songs. 
[02:25:30]  They've got an album called Not So Silent Night because those guys know how to rock.  I'm going to listen to Kevin Cronin.  Yeah.  Wait, can we?  What's the big song off that album?  Yeah.  What's that?  He's got a bunch of them.  Not So Silent Night.  I got to hear this.  It's a good song.  Can we hear a little bit of that?  His version of Sleigh Ride is good.  Sleigh Ride?  Yeah.  Is this all new?  It came out about two, three years ago.  So we're just helping.  But every year, you come up and...  Kevin Cronin.  I got to get a hold of the Larry the Cable Guy Christmas album.  He was up here yesterday, and he said he's got a good Christmas album. 
[02:26:00]  I got to play that one, too.  I bet it's get her done.  A lot of get her done stuff.  I like the new Duck Family Christmas album, too.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Duck fucking Dynasty?  Duck Dynasty?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  They got a good song with Luke Bryan on there.  Oh, they don't.  Merry Christmas.  They don't have a good song.  Merry Christmas.  Are you hearing some of the REO Speedwagon that then he says rocks?  Yeah.  Is this it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a little good old rock and roll here.  A little bluesy feel, if you will.  Not So Silent Night. 
[02:26:30]  REO, go.  It's a song you like to sing along with.  Yes.  That's right.  Rock and Christmas.  Rock and Christmas.  Rock and Christmas. 
[02:27:00]  You're rockin' Christmas.  Rockin' Christmas.  Bye, guys.  I gotta go.  Oh, Jimmy.  Look at Denny.  I got a 945 call time.  Jimmy's very young.  You missed the big meeting.  Yeah, I know.  I hate to miss that for a shoot.  Yeah, huh?  But, you know, if you want to come see me, check my website.  Tickets are really moving.  Oh, God.  Be safe, my friend.  Oh, no.  Thanks.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Jimmy's going to be at the Improv Thursday night in L.A. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  I need to even announce that, boy.  Tickets are zippin' along at all the venues.  Come to my town.  We're here.  Come to my town.  And Bill wants me to go to Europe.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  Oh, it was like thinking about it yesterday.  Yeah.  I'm not thinking about it today.  Oh, boy.  The entire team needs to be fired, myself included.  Oh, God.  See you, guys.  Bye, Jesus.  Say hi.  There goes Jim Norton.  All bundled up. 
[02:28:00]  I would ask you to continue with us, considering we're down a man, but I'm not feeling it.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Well, he just said he has to, you know.  Is it a quality issue?  He has to go and do his Christmas stuff.  Yeah, you've got to program the Christmas channel.  A lot of things going on.  Got to get that Kevin Cronin fucking Christmas thing.  I can't stand Christmas music.  No?  I'll listen to, like, Christmas Eve while I'm driving home from somewhere.  That's about it.  Oh, I love it.  I've already started listening to it.  No. 
[02:28:30]  Have you?  Oh, yeah.  I haven't.  I'll put it on Denny's channel, the Holly channel.  There is one Christmas song I do like.  Oh, no.  There is one Christmas song I do like.  No!  This is my favorite Christmas song of all time.  Very good, E-Rock.  But I mean.  But there's one I really like.  The one you really like.  Yes.  Jingle Bells with Barry Manilow.  Expose.  Shhh.  Shit.  House feeling pretty good.  La, la, la, la. 
[02:29:00]  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la.  Snow falling down in the la, la, la, la.  I hate this.  Everybody singing like la, la, la, la.  Dicking on a hardwood.  La, la, la, la.  With the la, la.  Make my way to the la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  And the people of the street.  La, la, la, la.  I fucking hate this song.  It's not Christmassy.  What's that, Denny?  He's the expert.  It's depressing and stupid.  I like to drink a little beer.  I like to act a little queer. 
[02:29:30]  Shut up.  Mortimer Leaf.  It's a dirge.  It's not festive and jolly.  It's a fucking jolly.  Right, thank you.  No.  Christmas songs have to be festive.  It's real.  No, it's shit.  Yeah, this is very visual, man.  I like this one.  You like this one, Denny?  Not really.  It's shit.  Not really.  What?  I don't care for it.  But you know what?  If we test it and research as well, we'll get it to us.  Remember the research?  Yeah, the call-out research.  I was a call-out research guy for WBAB. 
[02:30:00]  Playing the hooks?  I played the hooks and I couldn't get anyone to do it, so I would just make it up every night.  Play the hooks down the phone line.  Because if we didn't make it up, then we'd have gotten in trouble.  If we didn't get enough responses.  So you just bullshit it?  Total bullshit.  So how would you choose what was good and what was bad?  Just when your life sucks?  Yeah, pretty much.  Program from the heart.  Yeah.  Every once in a while, I would do one that I know they want to be a good one.  Oh, like that the station wants to be a good one.  Yeah, yeah.  And then that way they'd be like, oh, the Oapster got the numbers we were looking for. 
[02:30:30]  I completely fudged the numbers.  I was an intern at BAB and I couldn't...  That was my job.  I went there every afternoon and had to be on the phone for like four straight hours.  Nice.  And you would only get maybe one an hour tops that would do it.  You ruined the integrity of the station.  Whatever.  Who is this?  Is this Sleeves?  This is Sleeves.  What's wrong with you?  Sure, we're Sleeves.  It's a holiday classic.  Sure, we're Sleeves.  Turn this up.  It's not at my house.  No.  This shan't be played at my Christmas shindig. 
[02:31:00]  I'm the guy that does the Christmas Day event now for the family and friends.  Why?  Well, it's my...  I kind of fell into it now, you know?  So everyone comes over to my house on Christmas Day.  Right.  Christmas Eve is still over.  Uncle Tony and I in France.  Yeah.  But yeah, Christmas Day is my...  I shan't get that song even near my fucking house.  Good for you.  It's only going to be festive.  Have a holly jolly Christmas.  Very nice.  Yes.  You've got to go old school.  Enough with everyone trying to come up with a new Christmas song. 
[02:31:30]  Tradition.  Uh-huh.  My mom always plays the John Denver Muppets Christmas album.  That's nice.  No, it's not nice.  That's nice.  No, it's not a lot of fun.  You've got to get some Burl Ives in there.  Burl Ives.  Christmas.  Little Andy Williams.  Although, you know what's good?  The new Kelly Clarkson.  Shut up.  It's not good.  No, it's not.  She stopped by this past weekend and was our special guest DJ.  She wasn't here this last weekend.  She came in and taped it like two weeks ago.  Oh, the illusion's gone.  And maybe she'll come back on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  Oh, I bet on Christmas Day she's going to be here. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, of course.  Leona Lewis.  Another great Christmas album.  New this season.  Oh, yeah.  It's a good one.  Yeah, a lot of good songs out there.  It's not good.  It's just there.  Jordan Sparks got a great song.  I just like the classics.  That new movie.  What's that?  The Bachelor's Wedding or something.  I don't know anything about that.  Travis, you got anything to add to Christmas music?  Yeah.  You like something?  No.  Oh, good.  I don't know.  What happened?  When I was a kid and I still had a mom.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I forgot about that.  She left.  Oh, man.  The Jew stole her.  That's too bad.  Some fucking thief stole her.  But at least you keep in touch with her, which is nice. 
[02:32:30]  Holy shit.  No, I don't.  That's terrible.  How long has it been?  Twelve years.  Her loss.  But at least you know she's not celebrating Christmas without you.  I do know that.  But when she did celebrate Christmas, she used to play a cassette tape while we were opening  our gifts of...  The dreidel song.  I'm on a loop.  While she fucking beats it out the back door.  Everything was so obvious in hindsight.  Oh, right.  I don't know why I didn't notice.  A cassette.  Well, yeah, because it was, you know, the early 90s. 
[02:33:00]  Before she left.  Before she left.  Of cats meowing Christmas.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  Meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  What is it we're doing cats?  It wasn't me.  It was me.  They do it with dogs, too.  The dog runs different.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  Every year.  Wow.  That sucks.  And people who have pets always say, listen, listen.  They always have to go try to listen.  Now she plays it for her new Jew family. 
[02:33:30]  Now she's not allowed to listen to this.  Really?  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow 
[02:34:00]  This video is great.  I don't think I even want GIFs.  That's so cute.  No, if I don't take the GIFs, do I not have to listen to this?  Oh, I see.  Look, they're wearing little Santa hats.  That's so cute.  They're little kittens.  Yeah, but imagine listening to this without the visual.  And this is three minutes and 13 seconds long of this, too.  We had a double sight.  They're harmonizing.  Are you going to play this on the Christmas channel?  No.  You don't do the novelty once? 
[02:34:30]  We do.  But not this one.  Beats sleeves.  What?  Beats the shit out of dumb sleeves.  How dare you.  No, hits with a beat get a rapid repeat on the channel.  What the fuck?  This hunk of cat shit.  I like the Yule Log.  Do you remember the Yule Log?  Yeah, the cats are burying it in the box.  The Yule Log was not nice.  It was stupid.  It had the fireplace and the nice mud of iron.  I just want to remember, we had a real fireplace.  Well, some people do.  Oh, man.  We never did, but I do remember opening gifts with the Yule Log on channel. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, you did?  WPIX.  Or was it WNEW?  No, it was WPIX.  PIX had it?  11 Alive.  They still do?  They brought it back.  But it's only for an hour or so.  And it's on the internet, too.  I bet it's digital now, right?  It's like fake fucking CGI.  It used to be a real fucking log on a loop.  Yeah, but you saw where the loop was.  I know.  Sometimes you'd catch it.  Ah, that's where it was.  There was a jump cut.  Yep.  Whatever.  You'd feel lucky if you saw it.  I gotta pee.  Thanks, Dennis.  Hey, anytime.  Thank you, guys.  Dennis Falcone, ladies and gentlemen.  Where can we hear you, Denny?  I heard you, like I said, last night. 
[02:35:30]  You were on the 60s on 6.  I pop in on the 60s.  Yeah.  I'm trying to move it up to get into the 70s.  You know what you gotta play?  The vanilla fudge version of Set Me Free.  You keep me hanging on.  Yes.  I like that one.  Keep me hanging on.  Why don't we play here?  Play it.  Up to news time we go with the vanilla fudge.  No, you do the whole intro.  Play this.  Oh, it's a long ramp right there.  We're just gonna play it.  Sometimes, on a song like this, you just wanna play it.  No, you can find a spot.  Let me free. 
[02:36:00]  Why don't you be?  I actually like this one a lot.  Play this thing.  Hey, are you guys doing the Hunger Thong promos?  Oh, shut up.  Be quiet with the stuff.  I need a script and I can talk about Hunger Thong.  That guy doesn't like us because he saw the double dildo show.  We haven't worked with him since.  But you could win.  I saw him walking through the hallways and he gave me a look like he nodded like, hi.  Yeah, but one of the prizes is sitting in on the Opie and Anthony show.  But he doesn't want anything to do with us.  We blew it.  He came running in to give us some numbers and there was a double dildo show going on. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, right.  And he's a priest.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a famous story.  Well, you know what?  It's time to bury the hatchet.  You keep the vanilla fudge going.  He didn't like what was going on.  Bury that dildo.  It's time to bury the hatchet.  You know, this is the season to forgive.  Bury that dildo.  The season to believe.  It was like 12, 13 years ago.  He doesn't want anything to do with us.  That's in the past.  It's in the past.  It smelled like dirty vagina in the fucking studio when he came walking in.  Because he got a good bit on a clapton guitar or something.  Yeah, on a clapton guitar.  He wanted to get that out over the air.  And he runs in and he ran right into this. 
[02:37:00]  Into a girl with the clap.  Right.  See, that was your ramp right there.  You could have used that one.  You could have used that one.  You could keep talking, though, especially with weather.  We'll have all of your school closings coming up in the next hour.  Make sure you're careful driving out there.  A little vanilla fudge.  Back in the 60s.  What year was this?  It was 1966.  66?  Yeah.  On the big 69.  Nice. 
[02:37:30]  Why have we got the Yule Log on?  It's just a nice...  You should get it festive.  Yule Log's on the computer.  So festive.  How many dislikes does the Yule Log have?  One.  The Yule Log has a dislike.  It's got a dislike. 
[02:38:00]  Why?  It's a grinch.  It's telling you what it is.  What's wrong?  They didn't use the proper logs?  It's probably because they call it Christmas Fireplace.  Well...  Not the Yule Log.  Yeah.  I have a real fireplace now, so I don't need that fucking piece of shit.  Aw.  Stupid-ass Yule Log.  Fuck that.  I'll put a Doroflame in there.  Get one of the sparkly logs.  We had a real fireplace.  Yeah?  Yeah.  My mom, for a couple years... 
[02:38:30]  What, did you call you kids have to go out like a lumberjacks and collect the wood?  No, no.  Oh, okay.  We had plenty of things to burn.  Plenty of things to burn.  That doesn't sound...  She decided, like, seven kids, got to cut corners, so I'll get rid of garbage pickup.  Oh.  You burned your garbage in the fireplace?  Yeah.  That's gross.  Wow.  It must have smelled terrible.  It was plastic burning all over the house.  Oh, my God.  That's probably why I'm retarded.  Noxious fumes. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that seems harmful.  That does.  No.  Probably not good for the fireplace.  And then they got a wood-burning stove, which made burning garbage a lot more efficient.  I don't think that's...  They burn garbage on the stove?  Either.  Huh?  I don't think you can burn garbage on the stove.  Wood-burning stove.  Wood-burning stove.  Franklin stove?  What's wrong with you?  The old Franklin stove?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then...  Oh, and then we had to roll paper logs.  There was a log maker.  Oh, right.  It would roll the paper real tight.  And then you had to put, like, fucking wire on it. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, what a pain in the ass.  We always had these, like...  Yeah, the wood's right out back.  We always had these weird blue-collar jobs growing up.  I mean, we'd have to do cement work and make logs and...  Didn't you have the woods right out back?  You could just go back there and pick up fucking logs?  We did.  Oh.  We deforested it.  Oh, you fucking collected...  Deforestation?  Yeah.  Our own backyard.  In your yard?  Yeah.  Is that when they decided to cement over everything?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:40:00]  And then we plowed the fields.  Oh, right.  With bicycles.  With a huge, awesome backyard.  You remember?  Yeah.  Yeah, my brothers...  Sorry, I'm eating on the ass.  I'm starving.  I rarely do this now.  Oh.  Because I know how much it bothers people.  I try to, like, chew in between talking.  Sometimes it doesn't pan out.  Boom.  Yeah, the famous story, my twin brothers, younger than me, got brand new bikes.  And the first thing they did with it was plow the fields.  Plow the fields? 
[02:40:30]  What the fuck?  It wasn't a big field.  It was, I don't know, a quarter acre, maybe.  And they would use the bike like you would a horse if you were pulling a plow?  My dad got a big board, and they had to go back and forth.  The board was attached to their bikes.  Together?  Together.  Yeah.  With a rope?  Yeah, they're twins.  They did everything together.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That turn must have been hard to handle at the end.  Yeah.  The outside guy has to go faster. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, because we tilled the land, and then we had to flatten it.  Tilled the land?  We had to flatten it.  We had to get it all flat for the seating.  Walnut Grove?  Where are you?  The 1800s, right?  Dude, it was a nightmare.  So, Old West?  Yeah.  Hop on the covered wagon, make the ride to Sleepy Eyes?  Yeah.  And then we, my dad got us all in the van under the assumption we were going to play army in the woods, but he just found a really good spot that had rocks. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, you had to collect the rocks?  Yeah, roll them down the hill and then load them into the van.  Uh-huh.  I was 12.  Holy fuck.  I was 12.  And what were the rocks for?  Decorative?  To build rock walls, because that would keep us busy.  It was, whatever it would take to keep us busy and out of my mom's way.  Yeah, it sounds like somebody might have died of diphtheria on the way to the woods.  It sounds like Oregon Trail.  My brother.  You have to caulk the van across the river?  My brother, without a hint of a joke, will tell people that we did not have rooms. 
[02:42:00]  We had barracks.  Oh, wow.  Barracks.  And we would have to get up.  Just wake you up.  We also had to mix our own cement.  Out of what?  We found a sand pit.  We had to find them our own, though.  We had to dig around until we found a sand pit.  A sand pit.  An actual sand pit in our backyard.  In the woods, they have a lot of the sand things, though.  Especially on Long Island.  Yeah, Long Island.  And then we would have to...  We had a number of...  But you got to mix it with the fucking...  Cement.  Sacrete.  Yeah.  We did.  Yeah.  I know how to make cement. 
[02:42:30]  In a wheelbarrow.  Yeah.  And then I think we...  When he was really into his rock wall building, we had to...  I think we had to do like 10 a day.  I think that was the number.  We had to mix 10 wheelbarrows.  Barrows?  Wheelbarrows.  Yeah.  A day.  Jesus.  Full of cement.  Full of cement?  It was a nightmare.  And where was the cement on?  And then if you added too much water, it would be too like...  Too thin.  Too thin, which would piss him off.  Oh, boy.  He wasn't a yellow, though.  He was cool.  Did you write your names in the cement, at least? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, we did that.  Did you get in trouble for that?  No, but it's awkward because, like, there's a K there.  Oh.  It was one of the girls we brought in.  Right.  One day she was my sister's friend, and the next day she was our sister.  Sister.  No joke.  That's how it was presented to us.  She's now your sister.  How old was she?  She was, like, 14, 15.  So you were certainly of the age where it was like, how do you figure this person is now  my sister?  Right.  But she had red hair, so I was like, oh, okay. 
[02:43:30]  Maybe she was waiting for a while.  Well, you're an optimistic boy.  Like, oh, all right.  She kind of looks like us, I guess.  There's some red in our family.  Did you put your handprints in the cement?  No, just our initials.  But I remember my mom, when it all went bad and kicked her out of the house, because I  don't even know why.  Probably for something really stupid and dumb and not that serious.  I remember my mom out there with a chisel trying to take the K off our family sidewalk  that had all our initials on it. 
[02:44:00]  Holy shit.  Was she like a picture cutter, too?  I told you that.  Yeah, if she was mad at one of us, next thing you know, our faces would be removed from  family photos.  That's funny, because that's always the insane thing in movies that people do.  If someone does something in a movie like that, it means they're crazy.  No, I live that.  Holy shit.  I got to prove it, though, because I think people don't believe that one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I will find some of the pictures where, I think it's my brother. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, he was acting up, so his face was cut out for a while.  That's like fucking Mommy Dearest.  They were like, she can make you disappear.  Oh, yeah, there's some Mommy Dearest in my upbringing.  Cut the new uncle out of the fucking picture.  Yep.  And Tina would look at it and say, oh, she can make you disappear.  But she can't hurt me anymore.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  I learned that.  She can't hurt me anymore.  That's good.  Terrific.  I finally got the upper hand.  Congrats. 
[02:45:00]  Thank you.  Now that I'm well into my 30s, she can't hurt me anymore.  You're into your...  Wow.  Well into my 30s.  How well?  Pretty well.  Excellent.  I'm well into my 30s.  Excellently into your 30s.  What?  You can add a few fucking extra...  Decades?  Extra years into your 30s.  As long as you just say you're well into your 30s.  Yeah.  Perfectly.  I like listening to...  I was listening to the after show.  Yeah.  I think it was yesterday.  And I heard young Sam Roberts starting to relate to the fact that he's getting older. 
[02:45:30]  And not fucking fitting in as well into what is hip with some of the younger people.  Because I had a 20-year-old on the show who's a comedian.  I know.  Pete Davidson.  That's a weird thing.  Who was that clown?  He was good.  I heard him on the way home.  Who was that clown?  He's on Guy Code.  Yeah.  Who is he?  He's a comedian.  He's a funny guy.  Oh.  I don't know what you're angry at him for.  He told a great Mike Paschetti story.  I didn't hear that.  That was home by then. 
[02:46:00]  That was a good one.  What are you mad about?  Who was that clown?  I just told you what the guy's name was.  What's Guy Code?  It's a giant...  It's a show that ain't for you.  Yeah.  It's a giant show for teenage girls.  It's for teenage girls, apparently.  I don't know.  He's a good dude.  Yeah.  He's a really good dude.  So next time he comes on, he's going to be funny?  He was funny last...  He was funny yesterday.  Oh.  He was pretty funny.  I got a lot of good feedback.  But he also told a story of he was driving Mike Paschetti home from a club.  Right.  And, you know, Mike had asked him for a ride, so he drove him out to Staten Island. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  And he drove him to where Mike Paschetti said he lived.  Right.  And then Mike, when they got near the house, turned to him and said, Pete, this is really  embarrassing, but I don't live here anymore.  I don't live here anymore.  I forgot.  I don't...  This isn't where I live.  Did he know where he lived?  No.  And then Pete goes, where do you live?  And he goes, I don't know.  I mean, it's here in Staten Island, but it's near the gas station.  Oh, my God.  Is that real?  Yeah.  And Pete goes, what gas station?  I don't know. 
[02:47:00]  I'm sorry.  So he had to call his mom.  He had to call his mom.  What?  And his mom had to say, Mike, how many times do I have to tell you where you live?  How old was he?  Eight, nine?  No.  No.  I mean, 40.  This was three years ago.  Oh, my God.  It was like 46.  We worked with a guy like that.  Yeah.  Earl did not know how to get home unless he was on the trains.  Black Earl Douglas?  Swear to God.  Like he couldn't walk to his place?  When we were at NEW, he was the van driver. 
[02:47:30]  And at the end of the run, they would have to drive him home.  And he would not know how to get to his home.  Do you remember how often he got lost?  I swear to God.  And then they finally had to just get him to a subway, and then he could figure it out.  He had no idea how to do it.  He couldn't just give the...  Did he live in the city?  Yeah.  Where did he live?  Queens?  Oh, okay.  I forgot where he lived.  Back then.  Not Regal Park.  It was Queens, though, right?  Somewhere in Queens?  But not in like Manhattan on the grid system.  No, no, no, no.  That's so funny.  So he couldn't drive to his house.  No, they finally had to just find a subway. 
[02:48:00]  And he was happy.  And they just dropped him off.  Yeah.  That is the weirdest thing to me.  So he didn't take the subway home.  So Bichetti couldn't find his house.  No, he didn't know where he lived.  Let's get him on the phone.  I want to talk to him about it.  Did you get his side of the story?  No.  Oh, we got to.  How about tomorrow?  Yeah.  Let's try to book Mike Bichetti for tomorrow.  Uh-huh.  On the phone.  Yeah, that was fucked up.  It's like his mother had to tell him where he lived.  Yeah, because I guess he's still with his mom.  And the fact that he didn't know that he didn't live somewhere anymore until he got close to it. 
[02:48:30]  Until he got there.  It's like fucked up.  I love Mike Bichetti.  Oh, yeah.  But I couldn't imagine.  Like this kid who was in yesterday started doing stand-up when he was like 16.  And so he's like 16, 17 years old and hanging out with Mike Bichetti.  My mom would have been like, oh, fuck no.  Get the fuck out of here.  You're not giving that guy a ride home.  Who is this guy?  Right.  You're not fucking getting near him.  Yeah.  I was just fucking around.  He sounded like a good guy yesterday.  He was funny.  I was just fucking around and be totally honest.  Oh, yeah.  He was very funny.  We got a girlfriend shoe shopping thing. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, right.  Yeah, we were talking about this.  I heard this story on the way in.  But this guy had to have other issues, right?  I would hope.  It's not just the fact that his wife or girl, whatever it is, pissed him off shopping.  Girlfriend's shoe shopping drives man to jump to his death.  A man reportedly fed up with his girlfriend's marathon five-hour shopping spree.  Stop it, five hours.  Jumped seven floors to his death from an upper level of a Chinese mall.  Seven floors?  What is it?  A pagoda? 
[02:49:30]  Jesus.  Yeah.  A little fucking Chinese tower?  Tower!  He's out!  38.  Had been carrying bags for his...  What's his name?  What?  I didn't realize you were saying the man's name.  That's how you say it.  I show respect.  Yeah, no.  I don't know if you're Chinese names.  You pronounce it correctly.  Tower!  I saw!  38.  Had been carrying bags for his shopaholic gal pal around a busy shopping mall in Zazua,  in the eastern providence of Jiangzhou province.  Province, yes. 
[02:50:00]  According to the Daily Mail in London, when the girlfriend asked him to come with her  to one more store for a shoe sale, Tower!  Lost it.  Witnesses say.  Fuck that.  He told her she already had enough shoes, more shoes than she could wear in a lifetime,  and it was pointless buying any more.  You'll have enough shoes.  She started shouting at him, accusing him of being a skinflint.  Is that him?  Yeah.  Jesus!  They show it?  You got a picture of this guy.  Fucking splattered on the floor. 
[02:50:30]  Wow.  She said he was a skinflint and of spoiling Christmas.  It was a really heated argument.  The shouting match then took its tragic turn when Tao tossed all the shopping bags and jumped  over a balcony safety railing, dropping seven stories.  Wow.  He clipped several holiday decorations on his waist.  He certainly did.  You could see them.  Before impact and death.  What a holly jolly way to go.  I wonder if he had any other issues besides the shopping.  No.  It was probably just the shopping.  Five hours? 
[02:51:00]  I've been in that boat before.  That's probably a hack to say, but I mean, you really do start losing your fucking mind.  Fucking insane.  You just feel like it's never ending.  Like, it's never going to end.  Especially when you first get in there, you just know how long you're going to be there,  and then trying to get out, you're just almost at the door, and then they go,  Oh, one more thing.  Let me lift the Columbo.  Pardon me, one more thing.  Like, no, I'm done.  I wanted to try this on before we go.  Oh, try it.  Oh, God, these fucking hair-lipped kids. 
[02:51:30]  Enough.  Yeah, but they could.  I want to look at them.  They almost got it figured out, though.  Yeah, but I don't want to look at these kids with their fucking noses ripped open.  I sponsored one.  Did you?  What?  You sponsored a hair-lipped kid?  Did you?  I don't like talking about my charities, but I did.  Dear Ndugu.  No, I was at the gym, and that popped on, and I quickly went to my phone.  I couldn't.  Oh, fuck.  I don't like talking about it, but this one, I guess I gotta.  Man.  Well, anything you could do to get rid of those fucking... 
[02:52:00]  And it was only like 20 bucks.  Whole face kids.  It's 20 bucks just to do that?  To make me feel good about myself for the rest of the day.  That's, you know, well worth 20 bucks, yeah.  And where do they get the new lip from?  I think they just shove the old shit together.  No, because some of it is so bad, there's not enough there, so I'm trying to figure out where they get the lip.  I think they just pull it in.  You think that's it?  Yeah, they fix the cleft.  The skin between their toes.  That would be disgusting.  And make a lip out of it.  That's disgusting.  I would go, I think you have to take some off your ass. 
[02:52:30]  You think ass skin?  And then put it underneath a little bit, and then you do the stretchy thing.  Yeah, but then everybody's gonna call you shitty lips forever.  They just pull that shit close.  Not if they look like pillow lips.  Then it's sexy.  Then it's sexy, right.  Pull that shit close like Stacey Keech.  Right.  By the way, I gotta apologize.  I didn't realize I had an open fly and a bulge on my first picture I tweeted.  I was wondering why you did that.  But everyone that pointed out, especially if you're a guy, you failed the test. 
[02:53:00]  Uh-huh.  You're not supposed to notice that shit.  Why are you tweeting me about that?  You were the one.  You should be ignoring that.  You didn't see this?  No.  It's very difficult to ignore.  You took an Instagram, and it's a close-up shot of your open fly.  Dude, it looks like I got a semi.  I know.  And it looks like your fly cannot contain the massive girth in your pants.  What the fuck?  I was tweeting the nice cookies that Mrs. Fields gave to Mrs. Fields cookies, where they personalize  it with a picture on. 
[02:53:30]  And the picture is edible, I guess, right?  Yeah.  So you get the Mrs. Fields cookies, and you got me, Anthony, and Jimmy from one of our  magazine spreads on the top of the cookie.  I guess the people out there could do this?  Yeah.  With family photos and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  You betcha.  But then I realized...  Oh, you betcha.  I realized too late, and then decided to say, fuck it and leave it.  My fly is completely open.  Why don't you button all the buttons?  And it is having a tough time keeping the goodness contained. 
[02:54:00]  Oh.  Like this package.  There's not enough wrapping paper on this package.  There's no way this is going to seal end to end.  What are you going to do?  You don't button all the buttons, huh?  No, I'm too lazy.  I hate button flies.  When we were with the two UFC guys, I had an open fly, too.  Why?  That one was wide open.  It's embarrassing.  That's going to be my thing.  Until one of the bosses comes to you and says, Opie, can you button your fly up a little 
[02:54:30]  bit?  Yeah.  Like Steve Blatter.  He made you stop wearing sweatpants to work through humiliation tactics.  Yeah, he got really mad one day.  Who's that?  Why is Jennifer Garner crying?  She's always crying.  She's always crying.  He's flying with no fucking crying about that.  Oh, you know why she's crying?  Why?  Because of the paparazzi.  Oh, stalkers.  Because of the paparazzi.  Paparazzi.  I think you're the only person I've ever heard use an Italian accent for that word.  Paparazzi.  Paparazzo.  The paparazzo.  Look, we get bothered.  We get bothered, but not to that extent. 
[02:55:00]  But it's like, it's part of your fucking, you have the easiest life.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but you don't want them taking pictures of your kids.  No.  That's what it's about.  Oh.  It's about the kids.  There's ways of, you know, making sure that's not done.  Like, they're going to their schools and shit.  You wouldn't want them doing that.  Well, no.  That's some scumbag shit.  I'm sorry, Opie.  I didn't mean you're embarrassing.  I didn't, I was just trying to have a conversation.  No, no, no.  That's great.  Just a little back and forth.  She said, people that see the pictures think it's sweet, but what they don't see is the 
[02:55:30]  giant former gang member with tats and stuff hanging over the kid, taking pictures, and  screaming his name.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  They've gotten that bad?  Yeah, I guess that's what the deal is.  That's not cool.  The dealio.  I guess I changed my tune immediately on that one.  Oh, what tune is it now?  Um, what tune is it now?  I like that Saturday Night thing.  Can we play that again?  You didn't like it, though, huh? 
[02:56:00]  Oh, pretty good.  No, I thought it sounded a little dated.  That's too bad.  All the songs in that movie are dated.  Yeah, I saw Drop It Like It's Hot is in there.  And also Jump Around is in the new turbo animation.  Jump Around.  Not new, obviously, but new to me, because I finally saw it.  Uh-huh.  Snowstorm slamming East Coast.  No, it isn't.  Up to six inches.  It's not slamming anything.  There's nothing on the ground.  Look.  Look.  Look at the roads.  They're showing a live shot. 
[02:56:30]  Whatever.  A live shot.  And there's nothing on the sidewalks, nothing in the streets.  They're trying to cancel our staff lunch because of this snow.  I know.  That can't happen.  I know it's a hack bit at this point because we do it every year, but I don't understand  why they approach these snowstorms like it's never happened before.  Every time it snows, it's like, isn't this unbelievable?  No, it's not unbelievable.  We understand snow.  We understand it happens this time of year, and we understand what we have to do differently 
[02:57:00]  when it does.  But they just push it forward on these news channels.  Like, can you believe the apocalypse is here?  And then they've got to show pictures from places where it is snowing.  Right.  And try to confuse people.  Like, oh, where's that?  Oh.  It's so bizarre to me.  We all know how to handle snow.  This is a non-event, by the way.  It's snowing.  I mean, you know, snow's coming down.  It's not sticking on anything.  It's fine.  It's the first one.  But they have to tell you all these dumb things to do? 
[02:57:30]  We know.  It's retarded.  We did that.  We did that.  We did that.  In I Thought This Already Happened news, Californication will end after this upcoming season.  Oh, boy.  Everyone thought it was already.  I used to.  I was in.  I did about three.  I never watched.  What are they up to?  Seven.  Wow.  I missed four.  Seventh and final season.  I did three.  I liked it.  Something I won't be marathoning. 
[02:58:00]  No.  We also got the Joan Jett Serves SeaWorld with one of those cease and desist for using I Love Rock and Roll.  How do they use I Love Rock and Roll at SeaWorld?  It's cool when the whale is batting around an employee before he bites them in two and drags one of the halves down to the bottom of the tank.  They play that song.  Oh, that's fun.  Yeah.  I don't know why she wouldn't want that.  What's wrong with her?  It's good publicity.  Uh-huh.  And Heart becomes the, there's a lot of whale jokes. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, right.  Heart becomes the third band to cancel a SeaWorld gig after Blackfish Documentary.  That Blackfish Documentary really is turning a lot of people.  That's going to fuck over SeaWorld, right?  I think so.  But you're always going to get dumb fucking Midwest white trash people that are going to want to go see the whale.  You know?  Like, I mean, I'd rather they just fucking enjoy themselves wherever the fuck they do enjoy themselves. 
[02:59:00]  Where?  Alaska?  If they could make their environment much bigger.  Jesus.  Would you be in?  From watching that documentary, they just can't make it as big as they need it.  Right.  They need hundreds of miles of space and different pods of whales to interact with.  It's like the...  That would be a long day.  Oh, my God.  Right?  What a long fucking day.  Where SeaWorld goes, okay.  All right.  Their environment is now a hundred miles.  We're not really sure exactly where they are right now. 
[02:59:30]  The train is just standing there with an ocean behind them.  If the whale was here, you'd be seeing the...  That would be a long, long day of walking.  Yeah.  I would probably have to get an electric scooter to get around.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I think if you have the means to go on an Alaskan cruise or something, to go whale watching and stuff,  that's a good way to see them in their natural habitat.  If not, fucking log on and watch it on your computer. 
[03:00:00]  It's a miracle of modern technology, those computers.  You can see everything.  I really don't think you need to box up those giant fucking animals in a tiny tank.  Right.  Oh, we got to go.  Whoa, meeting.  We have a 10 o'clock meeting.  Shit.  10 o'clock meeting, and I got to fucking read something.  What do I got?  No, you're good.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Nice guy.  Thank you.  I almost said...  The only thing we didn't do today was the Macaulay Culkin.  Can we save that for tomorrow?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, give that some time.  Oh, and the Paul Rudd.  Fuck.  Give it some time. 
[03:00:30]  How long is that?  Paul Rudd thinks it's like seven minutes long.  Oh, shit.  We'll do that tomorrow.  Paul Rudd and Jason Segel interviewed from 2009 promoting I Love You, Man.  A movie I kind of liked, actually.  I didn't mind knowing.  It was a really good movie.  Where they are very stoned.  Are they saying they were stoned officially?  I don't think anybody...  Or people are assuming.  Yeah, it's an assumption.  Okay, so we got that for tomorrow.  And then Macaulay Culkin has decided to do a...  Is he still on the hair round?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I don't know.  If he's not, he loves something else.  After you hear what he's up to, you've got to think he might be. 
[03:01:00]  I can't wait until tomorrow before I hear what he's up to.  Macaulay Culkin's pizza-themed Velvet Underground cover band.  Pizza-themed.  It's called the Pizza Underground.  Yeah.  So I would assume that he's still on something.  Is he singing about pizza as...  Is he the singer?  He is one of the vocalists, yes.  And he sings Lou Reed's songs about pizza.  Oh, yeah.  Him and four other people.  Let me go right to the hit.  This is stupid.  A little taste of the hit before we delve deeper into his project. 
[03:01:30]  Gina came from Sicily, made her pies traditionally.  Pizza, but I said really much, put some cheese inside that crust.  Said, hey, Gina, take a bite of the wild slice.  Said, hey, babe, take a bite of the wild slice.  This is terrible. 
[03:02:00]  Take a bite of the wild slice.  Take a bite of the wild slice.  Your buffalo chicken slice.  Said, hey, babe, take a bite of the wild slice.  And let's eat the gals, say. 
[03:02:30]  I, I, I'm mad.  What's wrong?  I'm mad.  He was in Home Alone.  And Home Alone 2.  What the fuck?  What an asshole.  And getting even with Dad.  Hmm.  Is Dad still alive?  His dad?  I don't know.  I guess so.  Maybe.  I have no idea.  He hasn't spoken up in a while.  No, the old Culkin wars were always great.  Wow.  That's horrible.  I thought, put your father in the Culkin wars.  Is he doing that as a goof? 
[03:03:00]  I hope so.  I don't know.  I mean, it's obviously, like, somewhat, because he's singing about pizza.  But it's terrible.  Yeah.  It's not even fucking, like, funny.  It's not done well.  No.  There's nothing good about that.  He fucked up an amazing Hollywood career.  Oh, yeah.  Movie career.  We gotta go, Ken?  Yeah, we gotta go.  It's meeting time.  Yes, you're gonna be tardy.  Re-tardy.  Because I saw two bosses walk upstairs to the conference room already.  What about me, boss?  You're going upstairs?  Yeah.  What? 
[03:03:30]  It's in the boardroom upstairs.  Yeah.  Good name.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  You know what that means.  Up there?  Yeah.  I am live-tweeting the meeting.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Let's live-tweet.  We're gonna live-tweet the meeting.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  Opie Radio.  Opie Radio.  Good luck, everybody.  Anthony Kumia on Twitter.  Follow us, you fucks.

This meeting is so important that I have to be at it. 
[03:06:30]  I don't know if a lot of you know this or not,  but I am a crucial member of the behind-the-scenes staff at the Opie and Anthony show,  and there is no meeting without Sam Roberts.  That's what I was told.  Isn't that right, Sal?  Yes.  So what I'm going to do for you is this.  We were talking about both Nick Cannon and Mike Buschetti yesterday.  You remember Pete Davidson was in here.  Very funny guy.  He told a Mike Buschetti story that we were getting into earlier on the show,  and he was talking about his relationship with Nick Cannon.  Well, last time Mike Buschetti was in here, Nick Cannon did the after show, 
[03:07:00]  and then Mike Buschetti stopped by.  So I figured it only appropriate.  Maybe you don't know who Mike Buschetti is.  Maybe you do, and you just need to hear more of him.  So that's what we're going to play for you right now.  Nick Cannon stopping by after Opie and Anthony Live,  followed up by an appearance from the great Mike Buschetti.  And stay tuned because it's the Mike Buschetti appearance  where he does the classic Steven Singer live read with me,  which has probably sold more diamonds than Jay-Z. 
[03:07:30]  That's right.  So here it is.  Enjoy.  After O&A Live.  We've got a surprise guest coming in.  And when I say surprise, it's not just to you, but it's to me.  I didn't know he was stopping by today.  Yuri.  But it's not Yuri.  Yuri.  Yeah, wherever he's comfortable.  Nick!  What up, yo?  How are you doing, man?  I'm good.  You look great.  You look like a detective.  How are you, my friend?  I'm good.  Where we at?  Wherever you're comfortable.  All right, Sam.  Yes.  Are you black? 
[03:08:00]  No.  Why?  Because I always think, I like going,  I would look at your Instagram pictures and stuff.  You look at my Instagram pictures?  I do.  Thank you.  I do, a lot.  Nick Cannon is in the building.  I thought you were like, had like,  because you got so much flavor, man.  I was thinking like.  I appreciate you saying that.  You're like, worse.  I'm a lotto.  DJ Who Kid has been on a quest to find my black father.  You're definitely, you have like the hair.  You're sure that there's something there.  You're like the same complexion as like a lot of my friends.  Yeah?  Almost like my son is like,  my son has the same hair and like complexion as you. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  Is there something I should know?  I don't know.  Is the dude from, uh, is Red Foo from LMFAO?  Is he part-wise?  Yeah, he's in the Jackson family.  Well, not, no, the Gordy family.  The Gordy family.  That's right.  Yeah.  And he looks like exactly like me.  Exactly.  You're black.  All right.  I don't know.  Somebody can tell you the truth.  You're the expert.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  You know.  You'd be the expert.  Mama's baby, Papa's baby.  So you have, uh, your, your kids,  your, the complexion of your kids is fairly white.  That's what we call it. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  How old are they now?  Uh, two and a half.  Okay.  So you haven't had to explain to them, uh,  racial differences just yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that generation is not really going to care.  All of those kids are beige.  Yeah.  When you look at it, like everything's new kid.  They, they all got something.  Right.  Right.  There's like that whole purity thing.  That's out the window.  Sorry, KKK.  It can't, it's not going to happen.  Yeah.  Like they don't have to confront like racism until they get way older and have to deal with  even older people.  Yeah.  But everybody except like everybody's mixed with something. 
[03:09:30]  Everyone has something in them.  There's no pure race anymore.  It's the same thing as the gay thing now.  Like nobody's got a big coming out story anymore.  Cause everybody's like, yeah, whatever.  Yeah.  Like I'm trying to live my life.  I don't care who you're sleeping with.  Do it in your bedroom is your business.  Yeah.  I don't care.  Who's the, who's the, who's the more firm parent?  You or Mariah?  Definitely me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely me.  Just because, uh, I'm daddy.  You know what I mean?  You got to come.  Wait till your father gets home.  Yeah.  I got the loudest voice in the house.  Right. 
[03:10:00]  And especially cause my daughter is melodic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Not as melodic.  Um, my daughter is everything that you would think a little girl is supposed to be just  sweet, innocent, loves mommy.  And then my son is like just grimy and needs discipline.  So that's kind of like, really, but he's the one, like he'll, he'll head butt you as soon  as he meets you.  Like he's that kid.  How do you keep them from being brats?  Their mom and dad is Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey.  It doesn't get, and I'm just learning this cause they're only two and a half years old, 
[03:10:30]  but of course, because of course they're going to get, you know, the world and have access  to many things.  Of course.  Uh, but you never give them what they want.  How's that?  You give them what you want to give them.  You know what I mean?  If they come and say, Hey, I want an Xbox.  No, they just, you just don't get it.  No, you get like a Nintendo, even whatever's three degrees lower.  No, but you give it, you give it to them when you want to give it to them because that's  the thing.  No, you know, it's all tangible items, but, uh, it's about the importance that you put 
[03:11:00]  behind them.  And if they think that whenever they request something, they can have it in life, then  that's when you're creating spoiled brats.  But if you can say, no, you'll get this or you got to work for this.  So when I believe you deserve it, that's when you should have it.  Right. Like just to remind you, like everything that you want, I'm the filter comes through  me and I make that choice.  Now I would have met you got so much going on.  Yeah, it's a lot going on.  But are you home all the time?  Cause you have, all right, let's go over this list.  All right, here we go. 
[03:11:30]  You now have your own award show.  Yes.  You've invented, you had your own radio show, which by the way, you must be so glad to be  out of radio.  I look, I'm, I'm thinking of coming back.  Really?  Sirius XM.  I'm going to be somewhere in this building.  You've never seen me every day.  I would love it.  You got the DJ thing going on.  And I have to tell you something.  Yes.  I saw you DJ.  Yes, you did.  And we were all like, yeah, he's probably no good at DJing.  Cause he's this famous guy that just gets there.  Cause the name.  Yeah.  You had the whole place moving for three hours.  Like you do it for real.  That's what I do.  I actually was DJing in high school. 
[03:12:00]  So, I mean, I was one of those kids that with the, with the two techniques and the crater  records and all of that stuff every weekend.  So I've been, it's been part of my life for a long time.  But so now you've created your own award show.  Yes.  It's the fifth year.  Right.  It's the halo awards stands for helping and leading others.  Uh, because you know, I'm over there at team Nick.  I'm, I'm the chairman.  And, uh, early on we came up with this idea where we wanted to have the network stand for  something.  And it was all about youth empowerment.  So I was like, yo, forget all these other award shows where celebrities kissing each other's 
[03:12:30]  butts.  Right.  Let's go ahead and put it all the way out there.  It's about the, the community and this young people that shine that light on them instead  of all of the celebrities.  So we still have the celebrities.  I mean, every year we've had everyone from, you know, Lady Gaga to Justin Timberlake, LeBron  James.  You're going to let Richie Incognito present an award.  I mean, why not?  Why not?  Right.  Let them know.  It's all fine now.  There's no more beef. 
[03:13:00]  Right.  Everybody's on better terms now.  So that's, uh, that's Sunday the 17th.  Yeah.  It's going down this weekend.  Teen Nick Halo Awards.  Uh, this year we got Queen Latifah, Josh Hutchinson, Chris Paul.  Uh, it's going to be really cool.  My God.  Then you have a comedy special coming up.  Yeah.  That comes on the day before the Halo Awards.  Now, how do you, you know, you got on one end is that, so that's Saturday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's on Showtime.  Yeah.  So on one end, you're trying to promote this, let's help each other and let's see the  kids do well thing. 
[03:13:30]  And then on the other end, like your comedy, you can't be that wholesome in your comedy.  Can you know what it is?  It's one of those things.  I think people, cause I always say I'm not a role model cause a role is something that  you play.  I'm a real model.  A role is something that you butter.  Yeah.  I could open for you if you want.  He's here always.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  So you're not a role model.  No, but I mean, but there's, I mean, at the end of the day I'm a 33 year old man.  So I'm going to talk about 33 year old man things, but of course I still represent and, 
[03:14:00]  and love to empower the youth.  So just do the Nickelodeon people.  They try to get their hands in the other stuff that you're doing.  Make sure that really, I think early on, like if, if I would have been talking about  the things that I'm talking about now, when I was 19 on Nickelodeon, they probably would  have had an issue with it.  But I mean, I'm such a fixture in the game that where they, they know what it is and  they know the core of who I am.  And I mean, so it's kind of like, even like your movie roles, it might be one movie that  I'm in that's rated R and then another movie that I'm in that's, you know, rated G.  So you've never had any of these salacious scandals really with you. 
[03:14:30]  I mean, you know, and you've been a star since you were a kid.  Yeah.  I mean, uh, it's again, it's about just moving properly.  Not, not really like dabbling in everything you're supposed to be, but too much of anything  is always bad.  So no matter what it is, whether it's drugs, sex, don't overdo it.  So a little bit of drugs, a little bit of sex, a little bit of work and you're just  that way.  Nobody really picks up on anything. 
[03:15:00]  It balances out.  Does it?  I was, I saw when Mariah had her big song this summer.  Yeah.  Uh, and she was singing with what's his name?  Miguel.  Miguel.  Yeah.  And she was like on some haystack singing love songs to Miguel.  I was sitting there thinking about you.  Right.  Because you know, you're always close to my heart.  And I appreciate that.  Uh, and thinking that that would drive me crazy.  If my wife was sitting there singing to Miguel on some haystacks, like they're in love.  Not really.  I mean, there's so many factors into that, that to where one, I love my wife and I love 
[03:15:30]  when my wife looks sexy.  And I mean, that's, that's kind of when my Mariah posters were on the wall, that's how  she looked.  And you know, I was never jealous of the guys in the video then.  So I'm not now.  And then it's like, come on, man.  Like when you know you got home tight, you're not worried about anything.  I got you.  So you don't have to sit in the studio watching, like, let's make sure this chemistry doesn't  go to a certain point.  Really?  I mean, Miguel's my man, but he's not intimidating.  You're not, you're not threatened by him. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Like if it's some other people out there, who would you be threatened by?  I would probably be threatened if like Idris Elba.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If he was on the haystack with my wife, I'd probably be watching a little close.  Cause he can do all everybody, every different accent you can think of.  Exactly.  And he's a DJ.  Yeah.  So you'd be in a lot of trouble.  Exactly.  What is this that you're wearing here?  You look unbelievable.  Don't.  Oh my God.  Don't let me bring him out on there.  Did you get those shoes from Liberace? 
[03:16:30]  I wish.  His would probably have like diamonds on them.  You have, you have to be quite comfortable with your masculinity to wear purple socks and  glittered loafers.  That's what they are, right?  Yes, absolutely.  With fur on the collar of your jacket.  Jacket, the fedora.  I was a pimp in my former life.  You look, you look like a 1930s pimp.  Exactly.  Which is when pimps still looked cool.  Exactly.  They got all the way, 70s, everybody got confused.  But from the 30s to about the 60s, they were the dude.  It was good.  Absolutely. 
[03:17:00]  Where do you find these clothes?  You know what?  I, I, I'm a connoisseur of fine haberdasheries.  I just, wherever it is, wherever in the world, I try to have something unique on.  I need more people in my life that use words like haberdashery.  It seems more cultured than anything I'm used to.  Well, they're already wrapping you up.  Oh, man.  Our time has to go.  So short.  But yeah, so the fifth annual Halo Awards are on Sunday at Nick at Night.  Yes.  And that's the one where you get to see the kids be empowered. 
[03:17:30]  Yes.  And then Saturday.  Saturday is the comedy special on Showtime.  Where we're saying F the kids.  How do comedians feel about you doing stand-up?  I know there's some comedians that think you need to pay your dues more than you have.  See, who are those comedians?  Because if you're a real comedian, you know that I've been doing this since 1992.  Okay.  And you know what I mean?  So, and anybody, you know, I came up in a game with cats like Jeff Ross and like, you  know, like Chris Tucker, Chappelle, you know, I opened for Chappelle, all of that stuff. 
[03:18:00]  So.  Did Chappelle like you?  I mean.  He gave you the seal of approval, right?  Exactly.  I mean, early on, I met Dave when I was like 14 and, you know, he kind of took a liking  to me because he started when he was that young.  And you do have a little more of a comics mentality than a typical actor mentality that comes in  here.  I mean, the last time you were in here, I ran down a list of every radio bit you did that  I made fun of and you were right there with me.  Absolutely.  You weren't getting weird, you know, Hollywood-y on me.  Nah.  You're a human being.  That's what it's about, man.  I mean, at the end of the day, at my core, I'm a stand-up. 
[03:18:30]  Right.  So there's nothing you can say that can really offend me because I'm going to usually have  something to come back, so.  All right.  Well, watch the Showtime special.  Yeah.  Saturday, 8 p.m.  You'll be back on America's Got Talent.  Of course.  Wiling Out.  Yeah.  Wiling Out is on.  When you come in, you got to come check us out over there.  I will come by any time.  Absolutely.  We start shooting in a couple of months.  Sounds good.  I'll be there.  All right.  Nick Cannon, thank you so much.  We'll take a break.  Yeah.  Sirius XM.  And now, the O.P. Anthony Show continues.  This is After 1A Live. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, I like that.  What, did you think?  The stars were going to stop flooding in?  I didn't know Nick Cannon.  I guess he was late for some other shows, and I was like, fuck yeah.  Nick Cannon's always welcome in my house.  We had our beef for a while, but ever since, I don't know, I gained a whole level of respect.  Nick Cannon came in here, and we used to make fun of him because he used to do the radio show on 92.3 Now,  which was what K-Rock became after we left. 
[03:19:30]  And so he was the prized possession of Jocktober.  I mean, I used to kill him all the time.  I would listen to his show, even outside of October.  I would listen to his show constantly just to find things to make fun of him for  and just be running in here with my next Nick Cannon bit.  He came in here one day, a couple years ago, and I started running down my whole list of bits that were terrible that he did.  And he was sitting there, right, making fun of him with me, justifying him.  I was like, once you do that, you got my respect. 
[03:20:00]  Which is great because, you know, I mean, I'm self-deprecating myself.  You got to be funny yourself.  Right, you got to be.  Mike Bichetti is back.  I was telling the audience that you seemed like you got confused after the show.  Yeah, yeah, I was like.  You took a lap around the building.  I was like, wait a minute.  Oh, did he?  I forgot.  I was like, I was so excited, Sam.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Don't even worry about it.  Take a load off.  866-WOW-1-WOW if you want to call in.  We didn't have time to take any calls when Nick Cannon was in here.  What did you think of Nick, Eric?  Great.  He was good, right? 
[03:20:30]  Those shoes are amazing.  He was wearing.  He came in.  I thought they were like Michael Jackson shoes, but they're purple.  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, they're purple, like, sequins.  You saw them.  Did you see them?  He came in here.  He was wearing a fedora.  He was wearing a trench coat with, like, fur on the collar.  Oh, I've seen that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was wearing.  He had a three-piece suit on.  Whoa.  And he had sparkly purple shoes with purple socks.  Would you ever wear something like that?  The fedora, yeah, everything else.  Not the glitter shoes? 
[03:21:00]  No, not really.  You don't think you could pull that off?  I don't think they have, like, an 11 wide wide.  Is that your shoe size?  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  What kind of shoes you got on, Mike?  Oh.  Mike Bichetti's in here from the Artie Lang show.  Thank you, Sam.  These are supposedly.  Oh, yeah.  Get that leg up.  Yeah.  What kind of shoes are those?  I think they're supposed to be some kind of balanced shoe.  I don't know.  Do you fall down a lot?  I fell a lot with them.  They're lying.  You do.  You do.  I like to shoot a life out of them.  I fell more times than anything.  Right.  You're just walking down the street and all of a sudden. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, I'm taking a spill.  That sucks, man.  And it must be tough for you to get back up.  Oh, Sam, forget about it.  But you got to, don't you?  Yeah.  You know what?  I should be a bodybuilder.  You know how long it takes me to get out of bed?  How long?  Get a lift of my body.  Oh, it's a lot of weight.  Yeah.  It's, well, you're a lifter.  Yeah.  Let me go to Will in Pennsylvania.  What's up, Will?  Hey, guys.  I found out I'm going to Russia real soon.  Really?  Yes.  Oliver Stone thinks they won World War II. 
[03:22:00]  Well, I'm actually going to Cabrera, which is about 19 miles from China.  Why are you going to Russia?  A family friend actually is taking me, because she's from Russia, and she actually offered  to take me with her.  Hmm.  All right.  So, what's your question?  What would you do if you went to Russia?  If you went to Russia?  I mean, for me, I'd probably buy a new furry hat.  But, I'm going to leave...  You sunk this.  Right.  I'm going to leave this to the much more traveled, much more cultural Mike Bichetti. 
[03:22:30]  Mike.  Thank you, Sam.  That hat would be cool to get, first of all.  I like those fur hats.  Like, I would learn how to make Boston, like all the Eastern meat, pierogies, all things  like that.  First things I'd be going for.  What about the Russian girls?  Oh, man.  They're beautiful.  You like the Russians?  Very nice.  What would you do to them?  They're beautiful.  I don't know.  They're kind of tough, too.  They wouldn't take any crap off me.  So, I'd buy my P's and Q's and be a gentleman for a while.  You think so?  They got to know me.  You wouldn't tell them to just jump on the pole?  No, no, no, no.  I'd be afraid of them snapping my pole off. 
[03:23:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  Watch out for that, Will.  Don't let them snap your pole off.  Well, what I'm actually going to do is I'll be there for about a month.  And when I get there, I'm actually going to probably try some of the vodkas there they  have.  You like to drink, Mike?  Are you not a drinker?  I've been sober since 97, Sam.  Congratulations.  But vodka was cool.  I used to like Jack Daniels.  Brown liquor was good.  That was your poison?  It was definitely poison, Sam, for sure.  I'll bet.  Lady Trucker.  Hey, Mike. 
[03:23:30]  You seem to be a wonderful, firmest hero of the ladies.  So I was just wondering how many women have you slept with?  Mike, how many women intimately were talking about?  I used to have a trice with my best friend's sister for years on and off.  You used to have a trice with her?  Yeah, like friends with benefits in the old days.  I loved that, Sam, so much.  Gotcha.  Was she a dirty girl?  Yeah, to me.  I don't know how many other people she was dirty with, but you know.  Right, because you were just a friend with benefits.  There was no relationship.  It was just like, when I feel like being a filthy pig, let me invite Mike over, and he likes that. 
[03:24:00]  I liked it, but after a while, you can get attached to it, though, if you're not careful.  You've got to watch.  Is that what was happening with you?  Yeah, I started getting emotional with it.  I'm like, I don't need this crap.  These games of the heart can be very complicated, can't they?  Oh, yeah.  So what happened?  How do you keep yourself from getting attached to these women?  I just, you know, I just try to turn it off like a faucet.  Right, right, right.  Just ee-er, ee-er.  Gotcha.  What's your type of girl?  I like short chicks.  You like short chicks? 
[03:24:30]  Like Italian girls.  Because you're a tall guy.  How tall are you?  I'm only 5'10", but that's true.  Oh, okay.  I guess you have a big personality.  Thank you.  You have a commanding presence.  Thank you.  But you like short girls?  Yeah, definitely.  Like little short Jewish girls, Asian girls?  Jewish girls, Italian girls.  Okay.  Not the Asians so much.  No, they're beautiful, too.  Okay.  You're down for whatever at this point.  Black chicks, you know, anybody you know.  What do you think about Nick Cannon?  He was in here earlier.  He's fucking Mariah Carey.  He's the luckiest man on his planet Earth, buddy.  And you know what?  He's got kids with her.  You know what that means? 
[03:25:00]  No condom.  Wow.  He busted in her.  How long was she married to Tom?  Tom, you know, a while, right?  Yeah, a little while when she was younger, but now Nick Cannon is tapping that.  What do you think of that?  Would you fuck Mariah Carey?  I would sell my dick to the devil to have her.  You would.  As long as the devil doesn't get to use it, right?  You just don't want control over the dick.  He's a trickster, though, Sam, because you know what?  He'll probably, like, renege on the deal.  You're right.  You're right.  That devil.  Martin in Vegas.  Martin. 
[03:25:30]  You got a...  That's not Martin.  Is your phone on?  What the hell?  I think you got GPS going or something.  Do I say...  I'm such a...  Let's take a look.  Oh, yeah.  Is the GPS on?  Sorry, Sam.  Where is that directing you to?  Oh, 40 feet away from me, I think.  Don't even worry about it.  I'm sorry.  Let me shut this off.  I'm so, so sorry.  Sean in Philly.  Hey, Sam and Mike.  I was wondering if we could get Mike to do the Diamond Ring commercial again.  Well, you heard about these diamonds, haven't you, Mike? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  I was listening to it earlier when I came on.  Yeah.  You're not waiting.  And jump in with me here.  Do your ad-lib and throw some humor in this, because that's your specialty.  Okay, thank you, sir.  You know, you're not waiting for the holidays to hate Steven Singer, are you?  No, fuck those holidays.  That whore's going to have to wait a while.  No, why wait?  The longer you wait, Mike, the more you're going to hate Steven Singer.  Yeah, let him wait.  You know what?  It's my money.  Fuck him if you don't want to take it right away.  That's a guarantee.  Why not get her, Mike, that great gift right online at IHateStevenSinger.com? 
[03:26:30]  Well, you know what?  Maybe that whore's not worth the gift.  Give her something, you know, give her an ice cream cone and shut her the fuck up.  Well, another thing you could do, Steven has a collection of silver and diamond jewelry.  Did you know that?  Let me see how real that shit is.  I don't trust anybody, because bring me one of those glasses where you look at shit through a magnifying glass type thing.  I think he's got them in his store.  You can see those.  You can find the perfect gift, starting from $69 and going all the way up to $8,900.  Well, $89.  I thought it'd be a little $69, but how are you going to get this for that? 
[03:27:00]  You can get some jewelry, but would you spend $8,900 on a girl?  No.  No, you wouldn't do that.  I would spend $8,900 on myself, buy a nice Rolex.  Oh, okay.  Okay, that's an option.  Everything in between as well.  So, you know, you're thinking $5,000, $2,100.  Yeah, probably around a few hundred dollars a month.  Fuck, you don't really need, you know.  You don't need to go much more than that, do you?  Yeah, because you know what?  We don't want to wind up like MC Hammer, you know?  Exactly.  Steven makes holiday shipping so easy and affordable.  You just go online to IHateStevenSinger.com and check out his silver and diamond collection. 
[03:27:30]  Are you sure that website's still working?  Come on, maybe it's jammed up.  Who the fuck knows if it's still active?  Maybe just grab the money and ran that fucking prick.  I don't know if the site's still working.  That's fucking chalice that it is.  You don't know for sure.  You have to get the woman in your life a gift, Mike.  And you want it to be a great gift.  Fuck how it's that whore we got made before, you know?  Right.  It's a great gift.  I'll give her a fucking bologna sandwich, that whore.  That's true.  The more you procrastinate in buying her a holiday present, the guiltier you're going to feel.  The guiltier you feel, the bigger the present you're going to buy. 
[03:28:00]  I don't feel guilt.  That whore should be sucking the bone all the time.  I don't care.  Guilt comes at the end of my fucking dickwad in that whore's mouth.  I don't care about guilt.  So take this advice.  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com now.  Well, there's no rush.  Fuck him.  He can wait a while.  You don't have to rush him.  He's probably at home fucking counting his money.  He'll give a shit about that fucking income book.  Get your holiday shopping done today.  It doesn't have to be today.  It could be fucking a year from now.  Who cares?  He'll be fucking closing him down. 
[03:28:30]  People don't know a lot of shit.  Who cares?  Steven always has his fast and free shipping both ways.  And with his 90-day return policy, it's truly risk-free shopping.  I don't believe that bullshit.  90 fucking days.  You never get money back.  He's full of shit.  You still have to go to small claims court to get your money back from that fucking  re-prick.  And he says that it's guaranteed.  Steven Singer Jewelers.  It's the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.  Or online at IHATESTEVENSINGER.com.  I hate him as much as everybody else who's that fucking idiot. 
[03:29:00]  Thank you very much, Mike.  Thank you, sir.  I think we sold some diamonds today.  Let me go to Nick in Virginia.  Hey, Mike.  Mike, thank you for being the one that they chose to speak to the kids, you know?  Yeah.  Kids are the best because...  I've got to ask you, man.  That steamy pile of shit that you guys created, is that intentionally fucking horrible?  Or is it supposed to be...  All right.  All right.  He's trying to get over on you, Mike.  Tell me.  Go ahead.  You know what?  Let him go back to working at Dairy Queen in his meth lab. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Whatever he is.  What do you think he does that's so good?  He probably sells meat out of a truck somewhere in Wisconsin.  What do you think the last time he got laid was?  Oh, God.  Does his centuries still count?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Mike, tell me about...  What's the web series that you've launched?  Oh, thank you, Sam.  It's called Pubby Man.  Right.  It's about a fat superhero.  My friend Ken Burmeister created her with me.  And where can people find it?  Oh, it's on...  You can go to SaveMeTubbyMan.com.  And you play the lead role.  Yeah, or Blipp TV.  It's on now.  Or go to BulliesKeepOut.com. 
[03:30:00]  You decided to just keep it off YouTube?  No, Blipp TV is pretty good, Sam.  They've got a lot of cool people on that.  All right.  Well, I'll take your word for it.  Now, you're a guy who was bullied a lot growing up, right?  Yeah, unfortunately.  I think everybody was one way or another.  Sure, of course.  Except for the jocks.  The jocks don't get bullied.  I know.  You know, if I looked like George Clooney, I wouldn't be here now either.  I'd probably be...  Exactly.  But I learned earlier, you were a good-looking guy back in the day.  Yeah, I've got to bring a picture here the next time I'm here. 
[03:30:30]  I look, you know, from my high school yearbook, people are like, whoa.  So were you a ladies' man in high school?  No, it sucks.  You know, Sam, because I wish I had a time machine to go back in time because I was super  quiet and shy.  So you were just like a...  You were a good-looking guy, but awkward.  Yeah, very much.  Huh.  And now you're like, you're looking at those photos saying, what the fuck did I have to  be so awkward about?  I know.  I'm more outgoing now, but...  And now you're a disaster.  No, but...  No, but Sam, being a comic and an actor made me more outgoing.  You know what I mean?  Is that what it was? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you're getting on stage, you're engaging with strangers.  It's really a good thing.  I mean, you know, it made me more outgoing because, I mean, like, you know, it helped.  So when did things start to go south?  When did you start gaining weight and stuff like that?  Uh, I always had a weight problem up and down from, like, high school.  I was 155 pounds in high school.  I used to take the weight class, like, you know, gym class.  Sure.  Just the weight.  I could hang from a bar for, like, three minutes.  Jesus.  When I was 18 years old.  Now, pull your arms out of the sockets. 
[03:31:30]  I can't even reach for the ball.  I'm like, you're on and out.  You'll just see two severed Bichetti arms hanging off a bar.  You'll be like, I'll be decapitated on the bar.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  Then in my 20s, you know, I exercised.  And then, you know, I drank a lot.  And in my 30s, I got kind of sedentary.  I'm like, started doing comedy.  I'm like, you know, I didn't care.  Then, you know, you get a little bit older and, you know, all those.  So is that what happened?  You start drinking and then you start gaining weight.  You don't care about your appearance.  No, all those cheeseburgers catch up to you, buddy.  Is that right? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  Because when you're a kid, you can eat as many cheeseburgers as you want.  Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.  And that's what you did.  Now, are you trying to diet?  Yeah, definitely.  It's been almost three weeks now since I had a cut bread out in soda.  I learned that on your Instagram.  Soda is the enemy, Sam.  People are like, oh, have diet soda.  No, it's bull crap.  It is, right?  Same shit, right?  Same stuff.  They try to, you know, like, think about it, Sam, right?  Look at a bottle of soda.  There's a lot of sodium in there.  You know what that means?  You'll be drinking your butt off.  That's why they put so much sodium in there. 
[03:32:30]  Is that right?  They want you to come back.  Think about it, right?  Oh, because it'll make you more thirsty.  Yeah, yeah.  Sodium is salt.  What does salt do but make you thirsty?  Absolutely.  I understand.  There's a high content of salt in a lot of soda now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what's the goal in losing weight?  Is it just to feel healthier?  Is it to find a nice girl?  That's one part, Sam, find a nice girl.  And I also want to be a normal-looking human being, a somewhat normal-looking again.  Okay.  I mean, that's a struggle.  That's got to be a struggle.  But now, I've got to imagine.  I mean, you're on the Artie Lang show every day, right? 
[03:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  The Artie Lang show is a giant radio show.  We're on TV, too.  Right, and it's on DirecTV every night.  I'm super blessed to be here and with you guys and go there.  I love it.  I mean, there's only a few shows.  There's Opie and Anthony.  There's Howard Stern.  There's Artie Lang.  There's not very many radio shows that are that big, especially with the DirecTV element  like you guys have.  Oh, yeah.  You've become famous since then.  I wouldn't say I'm that famous.  I think people start to know me.  More famous, definitely, right?  Yeah.  You say you get recognized on the street? 
[03:33:30]  To me, famous is Adam Sandler.  Well, I mean, that's fucking billions of dollars a movie.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to start somewhere.  Oh, no, no.  But I love it, though, Sam.  People, like, I mean, you know yourself from having fans.  People send you stuff sometimes.  It's great.  What's something people have sent you?  I got, like, jerseys from football teams and baseball teams.  They're the right size?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Because otherwise.  But I get some cool letters from people, too.  Email, like, you know, I'm in recovery.  You and Artie help make me laugh and keep making us laugh. 
[03:34:00]  It's such.  And to you guys who are sober, that's got to be a great thing to be able to turn around  and help people.  But at the same time, isn't there anybody who wants to offer you a piece of poon for  entertaining them?  There's a woman out there.  But, I mean, you know, I'm selective, though, Sam.  You are?  Yeah, yeah.  You're not just going to go for any slice of pussy that comes your way?  No, I don't settle.  Good for you.  What about if it's just a hookup?  Yeah, that's good, too.  You don't mind that?  Yeah, you know, everybody looks the same in the dark with a light bulb.  Okay, so you're a little less selective when it comes to that. 
[03:34:30]  So are there any radio groupies that are big fans of the show that are willing to give  you a quick piece of poon in the dark?  I don't know.  There's a lot of psychos on Facebook and Twitter, too, though.  I mean, I actually get hit on Facebook a lot by, like, girls from dirt road countries.  Hi, what's your name?  I'm like, no, honey.  This is like a scamola.  Smart.  Sam, I'm from New York.  You're from New York.  Right.  Nobody runs a game on us.  No, no, no.  You've got to be street smart.  We totally are.  Right, right, right.  So you're not going to fall for a scam like that.  No, no.  But you do live events ever for the show? 
[03:35:00]  No.  Not really?  Because you'd think you'd...  Well, we're going to the Super Bowl again this year.  Oh, that's awesome.  Here's what you've got to do.  You and Artie are at the Super Bowl, right?  You've got all the fans.  All the fans are going to come to you, so you don't have to trust anybody on Facebook  or Twitter.  Then you see some nice poon out there in the crowd that likes...  Then you hook up with that, right?  Yeah.  Tap that ass.  Am I right?  Absolutely, because we went to New Orleans last year.  Have you ever been there?  No.  It's wild.  It's pretty...  I mean, I like the South, but it's a mixture of people down there. 
[03:35:30]  It's like French and Asian.  Yeah.  It's cool.  Did you get some ass?  Oh, no.  Oh, come on.  I was working all the time.  We were shooting all day and doing stuff.  So you're exhausted by the time you get home.  Yeah.  It just would have been nice if you got some of that, you know, Nala pussy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They show their tits for beads over there.  They do?  Yeah, yeah.  So you got to see some titty, at least.  No, we're working.  I'm like, damn much.  Oh, my God, with the work.  Sam, I'm like Charlie Brown when it comes to this kind of stuff.  They're just pulling that football out from under you.  How much work is there to do? 
[03:36:00]  No, but it's fun, though.  I mean, I'm just happy to do stuff.  Yeah, I mean, it's great.  And it's fun stuff, you know.  Plus, hopefully, you'll do enough of this stuff that you get popular enough that the  poon just starts getting thrown at you, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like dating Jim Carrey's leftovers.  Right.  You don't mind that.  No, no, no.  Jay in PA.  Out of the park there, Sammy.  I'm just curious.  Has Mikey ever tried, you know, one of those dating sites like, I don't know, Grindr?  Has he ever tried that?  What about that?  Why don't we get you?  What if we got you on Grindr?  Yeah.  Something like that? 
[03:36:30]  Grindr or any of the dating sites.  Did you ever try any online dating?  Years ago, before I was online, dating was like personal ads.  Those were brutal.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to do that.  Now, they got shit now on your phone.  Like, he's talking about Grindr.  You just put your picture in there, and then you see what dudes are around or whoever that  wants to hook up.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, Grindr is a man on man.  Fuck.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what Grindr.  I don't know, Mike.  I'm not here to judge.  I should know by the title, Sam Grindr. 
[03:37:00]  Grindr, yeah.  It's a nice dude to grind on.  It's like getting your dick grinded.  That's right.  No, but there are.  There's match.com.  You ever try any online dating?  Something.  Sam, someone told me there's something called cattle or fish or plenty of fish.  I don't know.  Something like that.  What about Christian Mingle?  No.  What about J-Date?  Yeah, that'll be cool.  Right.  Meet a nice Jewish girl on J-Date.  And what you do is.  They're nice.  I love Jewish girls.  They're awesome.  You put up a YouTube video of you on the Artie Lang show or you on the Opie and Anthony  show or you on stage or something and say, yeah, I'm fucking famous. 
[03:37:30]  I got a cool job.  Don't worry about what my photo looks like.  You know?  Something like that.  Or you throw up the Tubby Man thing.  Like, yeah, I'm doing shit.  Right?  I'm fighting bullies.  Thank you, buddy.  You're a pisser.  This is fun, man.  Thank you.  Josh in Ohio.  Sam, quit trying to sound hip-hop.  You're so stuck, you son of a bitch.  Joey in Cleveland.  I don't know.  Did I feel hip-hop to you, Mike?  No, he's a butt wipe.  Thank you.  Joey in Cleveland. 
[03:38:00]  Hey, Mike.  Hi, Joe.  Where do you, where can I find out where to send you a U&R Christmas present?  Can you, can you go, are you on Facebook?  Yeah.  Are you friends with me on Facebook?  You can definitely inbox me if you are.  All right.  So do a Facebook friend request.  Did anybody ever send you, Mike Fischetti, any weird stuff?  Oh, God, yeah.  Like, what kind of stuff?  Well, weird stuff. 
[03:38:30]  Somebody had sent me some baseball mirabilia.  Like, baseballs that were like.  Mirabilia?  Memorabilia, right?  Oh, I thought, like, mirrors.  That was like, you know, a replica of a Babe Ruth's autograph.  But I wish I had the real thing.  Right.  Like, what are you going to do with a stamp of Babe Ruth's autograph?  That's no good.  I know.  Are you a big sports fan, Sam?  Not a big sports fan.  Can I keep up, you know, follow the big stories?  You know, I heard you talking about, you were jumping all over the place today talking about  Richie Incognito. 
[03:39:00]  On one end, you're fighting the bullies.  But on the other end, you're saying, it's football.  Go be a man.  Well, yeah.  You know, people, the thing with that is, like, unfortunately, it's kind of like a blood  sport.  The fans are expecting, you know, like the gladiators.  You know what I mean?  And you've got to, you know, you've got to give in, you know, that's what they want.  Well, plus, when you're playing a game where the object is to damage the brain of your opponent,  to give your guy a concussion, bullying is probably the least of our concerns, right? 
[03:39:30]  No.  I mean, you've got to worry about your life.  Are you kidding me?  It's like, and he's a big guy.  I'm surprised he, you know, didn't fight back.  Yeah.  Yeah, if somebody's, like, if I was the size of, what's it, Jonathan Martin?  Me too.  And somebody's dropping M-bombs on me, I'm punching someone in the face.  And that's the end of it.  That's the end of it.  RC in Texas has a dating website for you.  What's up, RC?  I found a website for you.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  He can go to Farmers Only.  Farmers Only.  Wow.  You can either hook up with a good-looking girl or pull a plow, either one. 
[03:40:00]  I don't care, but a farmer's daughter's a cool.  I dated one for a little while.  You did?  Yeah.  From Nebraska.  Did you ever roll in the hay, if you know what I mean?  That's a make-out session.  You would have, but that's as far as it went.  You got a lot of girls in your life that you just made out with.  Yeah.  That's about as far as it goes.  Yeah.  I can't seal the deal for some reason.  Did the girls say you're a good kisser?  Yeah.  I had a lot of make-out sessions.  We kept coming back for more, but it was good.  Mm-hmm.  But that's as far as it went, making out.  No going down on her?  No. 
[03:40:30]  You'd think.  If she wants to see how to use that mouth, right?  Well, she was only, like, she was from the Midwest, and she was, like, kind of a,  she was a farmer's daughter, but she was also a virgin.  Oh, okay.  So she didn't want to...  Yeah, the wrong guy.  How old were you?  I was, like, 30...  Oh, jeez.  Hold on.  Sam, I was 34.  She was 28.  Okay.  28's a little old to be a virgin and still be playing that bullshit, isn't it?  I know.  She grew up in Nebraska in a farm town.  Jesus.  Snowy.  Oh, sorry.  I got to click the button.  Hey, hey, hey, Snowy.  What's up, buddy? 
[03:41:00]  Hey, dude.  You know, Mike, you sound a bit like I already over the radio.  You do have a similar cadence.  Thank you, but I think it's remarkable.  I've been able...  I'll re-year with him now, if it's possible.  It could rub off of him.  14 months.  14 months.  I learned that on your Instagram.  Oh, thank you.  Well, Mike Buschetti, you got to follow him on Instagram.  I told the guys about it today.  You're all about the Instagram videos.  I love it, though, Sam.  It's so much fun, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's a blast.  But you don't like the photos.  You like the videos.  Yeah, much better.  And you just like getting on there, saying your shit. 
[03:41:30]  Whatever you got to plug, whatever you got to promote, you're there.  I love it.  People rag about it, but I don't care.  You know, who cares?  So it's Mike Buschetti on Twitter, Mike Buschetti on Instagram, Mike Buschetti on Facebook.  You performing anywhere in the near future?  I'm actually going to be November 22nd at a place called Union Hall in Brooklyn.  All right.  With Dave Hill.  Then I'm going to be on Stutt Island December 20th at...  Oh, not Stutt, I'm sorry.  December 20th at Sarcasm Comedy Club or Pick the Potato.  And, of course, Yachty Lang Show.  Oh, yeah.  Yachty Lang, 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. every night.

I want to thank my two celebrity guests today, Nick Cannon and Mike Buschetti.  Thank you, Sam.  Ron and Fezzer coming up next.  Goodbye.  It's the worst of the open entry show.  Archie Bunker set everyone straight back in the day.  This is probably one of the more memorable Archie Bunker speeches that he gave. 
[03:42:30]  This is when...  Remember they used to have editorials on TV?  TV, the general manager of a station, just kind of read something.  He'd be like, ah, this is on, you know, maybe guns or something else, some charity thing.  And then they gave the regular Joe the opportunity to come on the station, sit down, and give a  rebuttal to one of the statements that were made.  And there you are, just some regular Joe on TV talking about it. 
[03:43:00]  10-11 used to do it here in New York all the time.  Yeah, when 1,000 people were watching.  Yeah, it was nothing.  Well, they ran with that on All in the Family on a gun control issue.  And Archie Bunker was doing the rebuttal on, and he was the pro-gun side of it.  And some of the stuff he said is classic, literally.  Speaking of the First Amendment, you don't get shows like Archie Bunker anymore.  No, no, you can't.  All in the Family type of programming.  Too risque.  Too politically incorrect. 
[03:43:30]  Some of the stuff you hear, the race-based humor on those shows are hysterical and just  would be completely taboo, boycotted now.  People would get fired if it ever made it onto TV.  Hell yeah.  It's too bad.  Oh my God, say this stuff on radio, you certainly would be fired.  Mm-hmm.  Here's Archie Bunker on gun control back in the day.  Late 70s, right?  Somewhere around, maybe mid.  Early, mid.  Yeah, let's go with early to mid.  Good evening, everybody.  This is Archie Bunker of 704 Hawson Street, veteran of the big war, speaking on behalf of 
[03:44:00]  guns for everybody.  Now, question.  What was the first thing that the communists done when they took over Russia?  Answer, gun control.  And there's a lot of people in this country who want to do the same thing to us here in  the kind of conspiracy, see.  Take your big international bankers.  They want to, what do you call, masticate the people of this here nation like puppets  on a wing.  And then when you get that gun, you'll turn this over to the commies. 
[03:44:30]  To the commies.  He's brilliant.  The damn commies.  God damn, this is funny.  And he was such a liberal, Carol O'Connor.  Yeah.  The absolute opposite of Archie Bunker.  Now, I want to talk about another thing that's on everybody's mind today, and that's your  stick-ups and your skyjackings, which, uh, if that was up to me, I could end the skyjackings  tomorrow.  All you got to do is arm all your passengers.  Oh, your passengers.  And if he ain't got no more superiority there, he ain't going to dare to pull out no rod. 
[03:45:00]  And then your airlines, then they wouldn't have to safe the passengers on the ground no  more.  They just pass out the pistols at the beginning of the trip.  And then he took them up again at the end.  They close.  That's brilliant.  We should have listened to Archie 30-some-odd years ago.  He was going to pull out a rod.  Yeah.  A rod.  And I forgot it was called skyjackers back in the day.  Skyjacking.  Skyjacking.  Hijacking was a truck, a highway.  Yep. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  They used to call them skyjackers.  I forgot about that.  Pass out the pistols at the beginning of the trip.  And then you collect them up at the end.  And then this is what he had to say about Democrats.  Right.  Well, the Democrats' way of running this country is to go tell us all how we ought to make  sacrifices.  God damn great on that stuff.  But they're all going to have us over the hill to the poorhouse.  We ain't going to be able to drive over there because we ain't got no gas.  So we're going to have to walk it. 
[03:46:00]  Well, the Reader's Digest says walking is very good for you.  Oh, ain't that lovely.  The Reader's Digest can always put a little joy into poverty.  My whole pain is this whole thing with the energy and everything.  This is all a conspiracy.  Don't you know that?  It's a conspiracy there.  Listen, for years, all our lives, they've been telling us to go out and buy stuff that  use energy.  You know, all the electrical stuff.  Like electric toasters, electric covers, electric stove, electric stereo, electric TV, 
[03:46:30]  electric race, electric hair blower, electric knives, electric every damn thing.  Not to mention the cars.  And now, after all the big corporations there make the billions and billions of dollars  worth of profits, signals, wham, they're changed.  And they have to tell us for years that we can't live without this junk.  Now they tell us that we've got to live without it.  The country is going straight into the dump.  That should have been said yesterday.  That's amazing, yeah.  That should have been said yesterday.  Same effing problems. 
[03:47:00]  Why are we even arguing?  It's the same crap.  That is the same issue as today.  Same crap.  So why are we even wasting energy talking about this?  It is what it is.  It's just going to stay that way.  Absolutely.  I can't wait to be a solar power completely.  And they're like, you're using too much of the sun.  The sun is getting tired.  So there you go.  Yeah.  On the family.  That's pretty cool.  Very timely.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.
