<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts expressing their boredom with the routine of their long-running radio program, reminiscing about past chaotic moments, including throwing condiments at guests and a guest masturbating on-air.  A significant portion of the show focused on the upcoming pizza party meticulously planned by their eccentric coworker, Roland.  Roland's preparations, including booking DJ Troy Kwan, possibly bouncer Derek Poundstone, and ordering ten specialty pizzas from Two Boots, were discussed at length, with speculation on potential managerial repercussions.  The hosts also played a voicemail from the deceased Mike Starr, the former Alice in Chains bassist, requesting drugs, and criticized Dr. Drew's rehab program.  A caller claimed to have found a dollar bill thrown out by Opie over a year ago, unexpectedly revealing a plan to build a portable nuclear fusion reactor, which led to a lengthy segment with Greg from Jersey.

Greg, the caller claiming to have built a portable nuclear fusion reactor using deuterated water and high voltage, explained his device, while facing significant skepticism and mockery from the hosts and callers, including an electrical engineer and a biochemist, who pointed out numerous flaws in his explanation.  The discussion devolved into increasingly absurd tangents with callers portraying fictional characters like Mr. Mysterio, Dr. Robotnik, and Dr. Claw, all expressing interest in the device.  A purported Dr. Michio Kaku briefly called in to dismiss the reactor’s viability. The hosts heavily implied the entire segment was a staged event orchestrated by a radio agency.  The segment concluded with a brief, nonsensical appearance by Charlie Sheen.

Opie then shared a childhood story about a disastrous school project, segueing into a rapid-fire list of names, including Victoria Gotti, Don Cade, Jesse Ventura, and Dr. Michio Kaku.  A phone interview with Dr. Kaku was repeatedly interrupted by technical difficulties, leading to humorous exchanges and a shift to off-color jokes.  The conversation briefly returned to Dr. Kaku's book, "Physics of the Future," before technical issues again disrupted the interview.  The show continued with discussions of Charlie Sheen’s antics, including his internship application and a new cooking show for Funny or Die, seemingly inspired by Opie's chicken-in-a-bag video, which was heavily promoted.  The hosts also debated the definition of "babysitting" versus "parenting," and further discussed the challenges and guest list issues surrounding Roland's Pizza Party.  E-Rock's video production efforts were also critiqued.

The show then transitioned to a critique of the Kathie Lee and Hoda show, describing it as rambling and nonsensical.  Clips of the show were played and heavily mocked, interspersed with crude jokes about Kathie Lee Gifford’s alleged past sexual encounters.  Opie and Anthony recounted a call from an XM Satellite Radio representative where the host pretended to be unaware of his employment, followed by discussions of a friend at Funny or Die, and humorous anecdotes about Oprah Winfrey and her staff. More crude jokes and sexually suggestive comments, using offensive racial slurs,  followed, referencing a "booyah" video.  The hosts discussed Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck’s alleged use of fake phone calls. Anthony also detailed his recent Ash Wednesday Twitter activity, engaging in sarcastic and offensive replies to other users, which led to vulgar jokes about priests, religion, and child abuse.  Opie shared a humorous anecdote about his child's christening.

The segment concluded with more discussion of the Kathie Lee and Hoda show, including a replayed clip with beeps obscuring offensive language. The show ended with preparations for the pizza party, plans for Twitter coverage, and more vulgar jokes.  A final segment previewed upcoming show content, including a repeat of a mustard spraying clip, a "This Day in ONA History" segment focusing on Sam's firing on March 10th, 2012, and exclusive pizza party audio.  The hosts also thanked Dr. Steve and Dr. Michio Kaku, briefly discussed the Teddercock show, and used frequent expletives throughout the segment, maintaining a lighthearted tone despite discussing a past firing and the show's uncertain future.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few women.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do this.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning.  Everybody.  It's your old pals, Opie and Anthony.  We're here.  Good morning.  Good morning to you.  Jesus.  This old gag.  Yes.  Groundhog Day, as you so eloquently put it. 
[00:01:30]  Holy shit.  That's true.  I was telling Ant this morning, I've got to be honest with people, it's sort of becoming  a grind.  It's Groundhog Day in here.  I know we have one of the easiest, you can't even call it a job.  I know we have one of the easiest gigs in America, but I was telling Ant, over the years,  we've been at this 17 years now.  Jesus.  Over the years, we always had something to push you forward, to look forward to.  Whether it was like, hey guys, you're going to be syndicated to Philly. 
[00:02:00]  Or, hey guys, we're working on that road show.  We've got a big gig coming up.  Guys, we've got that Sex for Sam promotion.  Oh boy.  I know that was a bad example.  Hey guys, another idiot was on TV last night promoting the show, Assault on the Media.  Yeah, yeah.  There's always something.  And now it's just becoming the same exact thing, day after day.  Yeah, like there's no, it's like there's no Christmas.  There's nothing to look forward to.  It's perpetually Tuesday. 
[00:02:30]  Just like that.  And I don't even know how we changed that, because the rules have changed.  That's just it, I know.  We're pretty much stuck in the middle of nowhere in this building, so it's not even easy to get to us.  No.  We used to have a very organic type radio show where people could just stop by.  Hang out the window and yell at the fucking guy sweeping the sidewalk across the street.  Whatever it was.  That was a classic.  But now, man, we've got to tell this building, I think, five days in advance if you're even coming to stop by on a whim. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  No more stopping by on a whim.  I know.  We used to get that.  It was like, who the fuck is that sitting out there?  Remember, like, who the fuck is sitting on the bleachers?  Who is that?  Right.  Now you hear, oh, it's just some fans.  They're in from fucking Ottawa.  Some fans from Ottawa.  We think he's retarded, but we're not sure.  Well, let's have him on the air and figure it out.  Yep.  He's retarded.  Fifteen minutes later, he's jerking off.  And then, I don't know, then people are calling saying you could get fired for that. 
[00:03:30]  That's what it was.  It was just that uncertainty of what was going on.  Thank God Bobo's mom had a sense of humor.  Oh, my God.  And was okay with the fact that her son was masturbating within 15 minutes of meeting us.  Like a monkey.  What a mess.  What a disaster.  And then we'd get mad at guests, and we would just pour condiments out the window at them.  Yeah.  That was another one.  That's still one of my favorite stories of all time. 
[00:04:00]  We've got to write the book.  You know the chapter that we want to write?  Maybe we don't write that for a while and just write the actual book.  Yeah.  Because the day of the mustard was just one of my favorite moments of all time.  The Chinaman coming into work with mustard.  Chinaman.  Mustard all over his suit.  And he doesn't know where the mustard came from.  Yeah.  Because it came from us three, four floors up.  I wonder if he thought it was just massive bird shift.  I don't know.  Like a pterodactyl flew over. 
[00:04:30]  And I know he never knew where it came from because then many times after that, I rode the elevator with the guy.  And you would assume if he knew the mustard came from our show that someone would get a beat down or something.  He never knew where that mustard came from.  Nope.  And of course, we were trying to get the guy with that stupid, what was it?  The toothpicks guy.  Oh, God.  That infuriated all of us to the point.  Toothpick guy.  I had to pour mustard on him from above.  And I missed him and I hit the Chinaman. 
[00:05:00]  Chinaman.  The Chinaman.  There's your Chinaman.  So I guess what I'm saying is we've got to shake some shit up.  Yeah.  Whatever that means.  Shit's got to be shook.  I know it's starting today.  Yes.  Yeah.  Today, I don't feel like it's Groundhog Day.  No, no.  There's something a little different taking place, although it's not during the show.  No.  Which kind of blows.  It's after the show, which means I won't be seeing any part of it.  Well, if he had it right after the show, I would definitely stick around for this. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, right after the show.  There's a couple hours in between the show and this big event that's happening here at  SiriusXM that I can't stick around.  What the hell are we supposed to do?  Because no one would happen.  Like, I would stick around and go, what the hell?  I'm going to stick around for this event that we're going to reveal in a minute here.  Oh, huge.  But then all of a sudden, the boss says, because this is how they think.  Oh, God.  That you're here.  We might as well just, you know, we might as well have a meeting.  Let's talk.  There's always a, might as well have a.  Oh.  How about we might as well not have a meeting? 
[00:06:00]  Well, you know what?  I'm snoring.  Right.  Since you guys are hanging around.  Yeah.  Why don't we go to my office for a little while?  Don't talk shop.  No!  Don't talk shop.  I'm here just for the pizza party.  Yeah.  And I'm waiting for it to begin.  So what's this pizza party about?  A big pizza party today.  I want to start with Travis and Danny, because they were laughing pretty damn hard when we  were talking about this just before the mics were cracked.  Travis, I'll start with you. 
[00:06:30]  What is the pizza party?  Well, see, we had a really good car crash comedy on Friday, right?  I thought it was terrific.  It was fantastic.  So we're going to do that again.  And you know how we were just bitching about how it's Groundhog Day?  Yeah.  Because every day is sort of the same to us.  And we don't like doing that.  We like to...  Oh, mixing it up.  We like to have things that people, we can look forward to and the listeners can look  forward to.  Yeah.  This car crash comedy...  Who am I kidding?  It's never going to happen.  Oh, no.  We actually had a meeting about it yesterday. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  They think it might make for a nice little road show in a few cities.  We talked about it yesterday with sales.  So I envision bringing that as a live radio show, yeah, in front of about a thousand people  in Boston, New York, and possibly Philly.  How great would that be?  Loved it.  A nice, organized, polished radio show in front of everyone.  That would be the first time in our history.  Indeed.  It would be.  It really would be.  That's true.  It actually would be, right?  So anyway, yeah.  Car crash was so good.  So yeah, we had a good show.  The staff did a great job.  I sent out an email letting everybody know what a good job they did. 
[00:07:30]  And Roland replies, he replies, yay, Gary throws us a pizza party.  What?  For no reason.  It's like, what?  He's trying to bait Gary into throwing us a pizza party for the great job that we did  on Car Crash Comedy.  How old is he?  A pizza party.  A pizza party.  I was going to say, this is a pizza party.  So then Gary, I guess, Gary walks by the office and Roland kind of not asks for the pizza 
[00:08:00]  party, but kind of tells him that he's throwing a pizza party for us.  People, pizza party.  And Gary's like, you know, Gary's not going to throw us a pizza party.  No.  How is Roland not fired yet?  I don't know.  It really is amazing.  He takes major chances.  And that's coming from us.  We've taken a shitload of chances over the years, but he fucking plays it way harder  than we do.  He gets lippy.  He gets really lippy.  And he doesn't care.  Really sarcastic.  But it might go back to what you said to me before the show, that maybe management 
[00:08:30]  doesn't hear what he's saying.  Doesn't understand him.  They don't understand him.  I was just saying, I honestly, and I'm not even joking, probably 70% of what Roland says  I cannot understand.  I don't understand him.  I think it's words, but a lot of it sounds like this.  Like yesterday, he was walking out and he was following me and he was talking about the  pizza party and all I heard was like, yes, I'm going to a dish of pizza party.  And I was like, I was like, he said some other words, but I don't know what they were. 
[00:09:00]  And I was like, pizza party?  What pizza party?  Oh, here we did.  I'm going to a pizza party.  What the fuck is he saying?  I don't know.  Our boss was asking Roland yesterday why he didn't show up to the meeting.  Oh, no.  And Roland just mumbled at him until he gave up.  He was like, okay.  See, it's a tactic.  He goes, I'm lost now.  Like he literally, like he looked at me and I said, I don't know what he's talking about  anymore.  See, it's not just me. 
[00:09:30]  No.  Good.  And he's, and he's really mad at Troy.  He's calling Troy a rat.  He's, oh, he's, he's furious with Troy.  He said, what's the difference between Troy and a rat?  And he said, nothing, nothing, nothing.  They're both what?  Hey, old traders or something.  Well, because what is he?  Charlie Sheen?  Because Roland had a talent meeting to go to at 1130.  We're winning.  Our meeting was at 11 yesterday, the staff meeting.  And so he didn't go to the staff meeting.  And so our boss came into the staff meeting and said, where's Roland? 
[00:10:00]  And we said he had a talent thing.  And our boss said, yeah, but I just saw him.  And, and, and Gary said, oh yeah, well, you know, we told him he was excused because  he has to leave at 1130.  And then Troy said to our boss, Gary's boss said, you know, when I was walking here, Roland  was pointing at my face, laughing, saying, ha ha, you have to go to the meeting.  I don't.  And he was bragging.  And so then we told Roland that Troy said that.  There's so much ratting going on around here. 
[00:10:30]  I can't wait to get Roland's take on that.  He is not going to be happy.  And then he sent an email to everybody, the entire company, including Mel.  But to be fair, the reason that Roland found out was because E-Rock told him, because E-Rock  was pissed that Troy ratted him out for being lazy with the worst of the week countdown  on Friday.  What is Troy doing?  Troy is a fucking snitch.  Troy is the lazy police around here.  The lazy police.  Let me tell you something.  When I met Troy about a year ago, Troy was one of the nicest people I've ever met. 
[00:11:00]  And after a year of being on this radio show's staff, he is exactly like one of us.  And he's completely been embraced.  I think somebody has a really bad influence on him.  We broke him down.  Who's that?  Sam Roberts.  Ah, yeah.  So it leads to the pizza party.  And Damien, you were laughing.  Pizza party.  Why are we having this pizza party?  Because Roland's a child.  You're going to lose your invite, dude.  Oh, shit.  Is it invite only?  Are there invites and everything? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, this is invite only.  And this is because Gary won't throw a pizza party?  Yeah, and then the next thing I know, like, you know how Roland sends out these, like,  you know, professional, like, you know, booked so-and-so in studio, you know?  Yeah.  He sends out, like, one that looks exactly like that, but it's for the pizza party.  He's like, pizza party.  Pizza party.  Me and Eric's office.  Noon, you know.  Is he allowed to just throw a pizza party?  Yeah.  I mean, it's pretty strict around here.  We had a KFC party a couple months ago.  He's paying for it out of his own pocket.  Yeah, but it's on company, you know, property, so I would think this would have to go through 
[00:12:00]  the lawyers if someone chokes on some cheese.  Oh, that's a good point.  Like, he basically, Gary said, well, Roland, I'm not going to throw a pizza party.  Are you going to, like, he's like, you're not going to throw a pizza party.  Why would I?  And then Roland said, oh, yes, I am.  Oh, contraire.  Oh, okay.  So is it, like, in your face?  Right, and then Roland said he wants to throw a pizza party that's so good that when management  throws the next pizza party, everyone's talking about Roland's pizza party.  No one's throwing a pizza party.  Doesn't a pizza party usually mean that someone just buys a couple pies? 
[00:12:30]  Not for Roland, no.  They're called pies in New York.  No, it doesn't.  A couple.  There's more than just a couple pies you bought?  Oh, yeah, yes.  And you talked to Roland yesterday?  This was yesterday when it was all starting to come together, when it was realizing that  this was a real thing, because I guess we don't have a lot of guests this week, so Roland  is using his free time to plan the pizza party.  To plan the pizza party?  And so I walked in, and it looked like he was getting guests ready for the show, but as  I was talking to him, I realized he's planning the pizza party. 
[00:13:00]  And he's very nervous about the pizza party.  Well, he wants to make sure it goes well, and that nobody who's not supposed to be there  shows up.  Well, I guess I'm not, because I don't think I got the pizza party email.  I don't think I got the official pizza party invite.  Well, you got one yesterday.  We did?  Yeah.  All right, this is Roland talking about his pizza party.  Roland, what are you up to?  I am up to booking guests, sir.  Oh, cool.  What do we got?  Stuff for people coming on the show, or?  Oops.  I might get a confirmation.  What's the confirmation for?  I don't know what you're talking about, sir. 
[00:13:30]  Big guest.  Someone says, I can't throw a pizza party.  I throw a pizza party.  You're throwing a pizza party?  Yes.  And also, I have a DJ, Troy Kwan, will be at the party spinning some tunes.  What else are you planning?  There'll be some surprises.  Is this a real thing?  You're really doing this?  It's happening Thursday at noon.  If you have the email and the special password, you're invited.  If not, I'm sorry.  I got the email.  Yes, you got everything.  You'll be here, but other people? 
[00:14:00]  You've been devoting a lot of time to this pizza party.  What's getting you so excited about this?  Because this is going to be an awesome pizza party.  So, the whole reason you're doing this is because...  I just want to show people, this is how you throw a pizza party.  Don't order two pizzas from Domino's for $5.99 and tease me.  Are you booking guests for the pizza party?  We're getting confirmation for guests to the pizza party.  But that's a mystery, though.  Yes. 
[00:14:30]  They're going to be here and go, hey, did I just bump into so-and-so?  They go, yes.  You're keeping it cool that way.  Yes, it's going to be a cool pizza party.  I can't wait.  Can you say it one more time?  A big pizza party!  Well, it sounds like it's going to be quite a party.  Oh, it will be.  He's a weirdo.  Yeah, and we have to say, it's not a bit.  He's really just...  No, he's very excited.  Nobody told him to do this.  He just started doing it.  And he's going to have Troy Kwan spinning tunes in our office?  He's literally...  I heard something about a bubble machine, too. 
[00:15:00]  A bubble machine.  Yeah, I heard about the bubble machine.  And he's getting, like, an iPod...  No, he's got Troy to bring in a laptop with, like, DJ software on it.  So he's going to...  And he's going to plug it into a stereo in his small office.  And we said, Roland, why don't you move it into, like, a studio?  And he said, I want it to have, like, a college dorm room feel.  So we're just going to pack everyone into my office.  But they're not going to allow this!  Does anyone understand?  It's got a bubble machine.  Yeah, like people working back there at noon.  Human resources. 
[00:15:30]  Well...  This thing has gotten...  Oh, well, they're supposed to be.  This is going to disrupt.  This is a...  You have no idea how out of control this has gotten?  This is a major disruption on my time.  Right.  I was walking down the hall yesterday.  Unsolicited.  Our bosses...  Gary's boss.  That guy.  His assistant comes out to me.  And he goes, so I hear about a pizza party tomorrow.  Ah.  So his assistant will be there.  A guy who works in traffic.  Yeah.  Who's just putting commercials and stuff in.  Goes, Sam, I keep hearing about this pizza party. 
[00:16:00]  Can't wait.  This is like the big event here.  And that just goes to show you, we're not alone.  Everyone feels like it's Groundhog's Day.  Right.  And they...  Like anything out of the ordinary.  And everyone's freaking out.  Wow.  About this pizza party.  E-Rock's got something else on this.  We're waiting on confirmation, but Roland may have a bouncer with the VIP list in order  to get into this pizza party.  Oh, like somebody standing at the door to the dorm room-like office?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  It's half a dorm room.  These offices are tiny.  It's the smallest fucking office.  Is he going to have it in two offices?  No, one office.  One office.  Just his?  Yes, just his.  And he's been contacting people that he knows from reality shows, trying to get celebrities  to stop by.  Wait, wait.  He wants a celebrity?  This one is star-studded?  I don't want to blow it.  Is the paparazzi going to be there?  He was trying...  He's trying to get Ryan Starr to perform at the pizza party.  Ryan Starr?  Isn't he going on...  This is retarded!  He's going on tour with Bon Jovi, I think.  Not today, though. 
[00:17:00]  He doesn't have time for a pizza party.  Not today.  I heard he was trying to book Tom Papa.  I'd rather have Mike Starr perform at the pizza party.  Oh, shit.  Mike Starr is dead.  That's fucked up.  This is fucking crazy, because, like, people have to not be distracted by noise and pizza.  Yeah, but you don't understand, Anthony.  This is a place...  SiriusXM is a place where you do anything but what you're supposed to be doing.  You just...  You hang out.  You have little parties in the corner. 
[00:17:30]  It's a bizarro office.  You walk around.  You're just always perpetually in the hallway.  Nothing gets done.  That's this place.  Oh, okay.  So it's okay to do that.  It's okay to throw pizza parties.  It's okay, because it's a big party.  This is going too far.  I predict that Roland gets fired by spring.  Spring?  Yeah, because he's too much of a...  He's too different.  He's a loose cannon.  He's a loose cannon for this new corporate environment that we're all a part of.  And I mean all, meaning the people listening as well.  They got that corporate bullshit happening where they work. 
[00:18:00]  He's spending hundreds of dollars out of his pocket for no reason for a pizza party.  It doesn't make any sense.  Just imagine you work for someone that's a bit rogue.  Yes, yes.  And they want to throw a pizza party at your office.  What would happen to that guy?  They would figure out a way to fire him.  His behavior is just impossible to predict.  So I hear you want to throw a pizza party.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not going to happen.  We're not going to be able to.  No.  Is Roland around yet?  Yeah, he's here. 
[00:18:30]  Is he planning?  Yeah, this is his big day.  Sam, could you walk the halls, just get audio?  I want to know what the buzz is on the pizza party.  Yeah, what's the buzz in the hallway about the pizza party?  Yeah, there's not people here.  Yeah, but throughout the morning and into the 10 o'clock show for sure we'll be covering this.  A few months ago, a couple of us were just talking about getting some KFC.  What do we got here?  And all of a sudden Roland's like, hey, I'll just buy everyone hundreds of dollars of KFC.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a joke. 
[00:19:00]  I just said, what did I say?  I was just like, hey, Roland, when are you going to buy us all lunch?  Just like as a joke.  Like, obviously, I wasn't serious.  And then he was just like, hey, what are you going to do?  You want to see KFC?  Let's go KFC.  And then all of a sudden we had hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of KFC.  Really?  I swear to God.  Where are you getting all this money from?  No, I think morale was down.  So I was like, people are down.  I said, so I'll bring it up.  I'll throw an epic pizza party.  Epic pizza party.  It's going to be epic.  10 pies from two boots.  None of this bullshit.  Wait, 10 pies from two boots, I think you said?  Two boots.  What's that?  I think you said.  Two boots pizza. 
[00:19:30]  It's like special pizza.  It's where they make like the Mr. Pink and all those like, what's the word I'm looking  for?  Specialty?  Specialty pizzas.  Specialty pizzas.  Can you get like the Hawaiian pizza?  Yes.  With pineapple-y stuff?  It's called the Hawaii Five-0.  It's called the Hawaii Five-0.  You really have 10 pies coming.  10 pies.  A cake is being baked right now from Amy's Bakery.  Thank you, Sarah.  A donation.  I've got cookies.  He's got a cookie platter.  He's thanking people.  He's got cookies.  You've got cookie platter coming? 
[00:20:00]  I'm soda, so nothing is coming out of the companies.  Nothing is being touched by the company.  And the company's allowing you to do this because they're a bunch of footy-duddies.  We have one hour lunch where we can do every one, so from 12 to 1.  It's a one hour long pizza party?  Yeah, because you only have one hour for lunch.  So I'm abiding by all rules.  And what about the sound of the music and the bubble machine?  Isn't that going to be a distraction?  I hear music all day in the hallway, so we'll be playing.  It's church radio.  We're just monitoring.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:20:30]  One of the production people, who will remain nameless because he'll probably get in trouble,  told me in the bathroom yesterday that he was thinking about making some imaging for  Roland's pizza party.  Actually, I was just going to say, maybe we should get Derek on a big intro for the pizza  party.  Somebody done.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first annual Roland Pizza Party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's pizza, soda, bubble machines. 
[00:21:00]  Troy Kwan spinning the tunes.  Let's get ready to get in trouble.  Celebrities.  Star-studded.  A half an hour before the pizza party, we will do a red carpet where we will be talking  to people going into the exclusive velvet rope pizza party.  If they can get past the bouncer.  You can ask people what they're eating.  Yeah.  What do you eat?  Well, I'm having the Hawaii Five-0.  Something a little different.  I'm just going strictly at cheese. 
[00:21:30]  That's me.  I'm a regular guy.  All right.  We'll see you inside.  We'll see you inside.  It's an honor just to be here.  I just found out who the bouncer's going to be.  Who?  Derek Poundstone.  Is that true?  That's what I'm hearing.  Was that supposed to be a surprise?  No, no.  There's no surprises.  It's just like he may appear.  And why?  Because you don't want certain people in there, but you're not allowed to openly say who  these people are, because then that's when you would get in trouble with HR.  That's correct.  So there's going to be a way to make sure these people understand they're not allowed, 
[00:22:00]  even though technically they're allowed.  Yeah, a little turkey to juice, whatever he wants.  I don't know what he said.  A little milk or turkey to juice?  That's what I just heard.  That's what I just heard.  I heard that, too.  That's what he drinks.  Yeah.  That power is that.  Juice?  I don't know.  He says that sometimes.  I've already been issued by Roland an exclusive press pass.  There's only one press pass.  Wait, wait.  Because you're covering the event.  Yeah, only one person.  So we will have exclusive coverage.  There is only one press pass being in.  You know, because of that, you've got to put a sign up in your little office that says, 
[00:22:30]  by walking in here, you do understand that you will be videotaped and audiotaped, which  can be used on the show.  For the opening show, yeah.  Yeah.  Make sure people know so you don't have to go.  Everyone with a release.  It's just crazy.  And I saw Roland outside this building, and he's very nervous about this.  Why are you nervous about your pizza party?  You want to make sure it goes off without a hitch, right?  Yeah, and then, um...  It's like an MTV show.  Like those maid or, you know, my sweet 16, my super sweet 16. 
[00:23:00]  True life, I'm hosting a pizza party.  True life, I'm hosting a pizza party.  True life, I'm hosting a pizza party.  Yes.  When Roland said the name of the bakery, it just was Mumble.  No, it was Amy.  Amy's Bread.  I never heard him say that.  This party...  You said Amy's Bread at some point?  Yeah, he did.  That would be Planola.  Except this isn't a...  There's no...  And image...  It's a pizza party.  There's nothing...  It's not a show. 
[00:23:30]  It's not being broadcast.  No, this is for nothing.  It's for nothing.  Why did you decide to...  Oh, because of the lunch thing?  Well, yeah, and morale.  People are, like, down.  So I tell people, why did we throw a pizza party?  They're like, oh my god, that's a great idea.  So I said, pizza party, next week.  Do they like you around here?  Are they trying to figure you out?  I think they should...  I don't know.  Management doesn't know what to make of him, because at points, it seems like he's being  insubordinate.  Yes.  But then he does really, like, company guy type of things. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Like he helps out, like, another show getting guests.  And he performs, yeah.  His, like, job description, he performs that job very well.  But when he's not doing that thing, he's being a lunatic.  Because on the flip side, he's hosting pizza parties and falling asleep in meetings.  Right.  Now, I...  Well, I can't throw any...  Well, there's stones there.  Anthony was the king of the nap in the last one, so...  I...  Wow.  He still got you beat by more than a couple.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I try.  I try, but what do you think? 
[00:24:30]  I went in there with the intention of falling asleep?  No.  You can't help it.  Just have to pass out the cross next time.  And make it religious.  Yes.  That's what he does.  Something else I noticed about Roland.  He knows his food.  I've been observing this for a while.  He knows it.  If you mention a food group, he'll tell you the best place to get that food group in New York City.  Really?  It's amazing.  Go with...  I didn't set this up ahead of time.  Hamburger.  Where would you go for a hamburger in New York City? 
[00:25:00]  That's a good one.  Good burger.  Why?  Because there's a bunch of different places?  There's a lot of different places.  So I started off too hard?  We went on E-Rock's birthday, which was the day that E-Rock needed cheering up, if you remember.  Yeah.  He wanted barbecue.  And Roland insisted that we go all the way down into the 20s.  Oh my God.  He said, we could just go across the street.  And Roland said, no, no.  We got to go to Rub.  Because he knows where the best barbecue place is.  Yeah, Rub.  Rub.  Well, for a burger, I would say go to the park or Meridian there.  That little place that's behind the curtain. 
[00:25:30]  That's what I try to tell him about.  The curtain is good.  I like that.  What's your favorite?  It's sometimes overrated, though.  If they're too busy, they have a stack.  Yeah.  All right.  What about pizza?  Is it where you're getting the pizza from today?  Oh, Ray's.  Ray's pizza.  Ray's pizza.  Original Ray's?  Famous original Ray's?  Famous original Ray's?  Or Kest?  Or two boots.  What?  Kest.  K-E-S-T-E.  Kest.  K-A-S-T?  Mm-hmm.  What about for your baked goods?  Like, what about for your... 
[00:26:00]  Oh, Amy's bread is really good.  Amy's bread is really good.  What about the best breakfast in Manhattan?  Columbus Street Bakery down in...  He knows.  How does he know all this?  See, most people, when you live in New York, you just eat...  A big waste?  You eat within two blocks of where you live, not rolling.  He travels.  He travels because he knows where the best places are for what he's looking for.  I don't know how...  Well, he's eked it out, I guess. 
[00:26:30]  Going around New York City, finding the best food.  Have you...  Did you find this by trial and error?  Like, going into some bad places and going,  Oh, that was...  I didn't think that was good food.  Yeah.  All right, well...  Big pizza party at noon.  You guys gotta stick around.  Don't even show up, anybody.  Don't show up unless you're on the list.  Are Opie and Anthony invited?  Because they weren't...  They're invited by 90 guys at 9.59.  Hey, we make it to 10.  A 10, I'm sorry.  10 o'clock. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  I'll be smelling the pizza in the elevator as the pizza guy comes up.  Well, this summer, one of my buddies is coming for the barbecue championship.  I'll throw a barbecue party.  And you guys...  I do it right at 11.  I have the pits outside.  That's not allowed!  Barbecue pits in the building?  No, outside, though.  Because if you get permits saying you're taping a segment for a TV show, they'll give you permits.  So are you working on this now?  Possibly.  Let's get past the pizza party. 
[00:27:30]  I have a feeling tomorrow at this time we're going to have a...  A pig roast.  We're going to be discussing the pizza party.  And everything that went wrong.  What a...  Yeah.  Now, is it being delivered, the pizzas?  Oh, yeah.  I gave them specific instructions.  Oh, boy.  See, that's a loose end right there.  That's kind of a...  Why specific?  Well, I ordered yesterday for...  Already today.  So they can already cook the pies this morning.  What if they preheat these damn things?  I can tell the difference.  You will.  Oh, shit.  And you'll be really mad at these people, right?  I'll just call them.  I'll call my credit card stolen, and then they get canceled. 
[00:28:00]  I'm telling the guy, don't fuck with me.  Because I know.  This is what we're talking about.  I know.  He's insane.  Roland will rip your fucking head off.  Yeah.  We learned that at the other place.  We thought Roland was a pushover.  And one day, we all realized this fucking guy will rip your head off.  He is not a pushover.  Not at all.  So I get a nice s'more to me up and down that they'll make it fresh.  Oh, the other thing before we move on with the actual radio show.  You're mad at Troy Kwan.  Oh, man.  I saw your email. 
[00:28:30]  You're kind of...  I was mad, but then I let it go, because I do like Troy.  He says that, though.  I have a feeling that at some point...  Where is Troy?  Let's get him in here for this.  Troy will realize, oh, shit, Roland just got me back.  Because Troy...  Like, Roland will pretend he forgives you, and then he'll do something to you that you  had no idea was coming.  Like, he'll just pull one of his strings.  Oh.  Here's Troy.  And all of a sudden, boom.  I don't know if this is...  Revenge.  I don't know if we need the music today.  I don't know if this is a conspiracy or not.  It's just his...  It's become his music. 
[00:29:00]  Troy, did you ride out Roland?  I was joking around in the meeting, and I don't know what spin Sam put on it afterward.  Was I lying?  It wasn't spin.  It was Sam's spin.  That person said, hey, come here for a second.  Yeah.  But then I realized...  What do you say at the meeting, once again?  I want to hear it from your mouth.  Well, basically, we have these meetings every week, and they're necessary.  I understand that.  But they're not the most fun things to do.  Really?  Don't tell me about it.  So, you know, but we have to do it, and I understand it.  You're still too corporate, by the way.  We'll knock that out of you. 
[00:29:30]  He's spitting.  Yeah.  Anyway.  A meeting's never necessary.  You know what?  Record the meetings, because sometimes it gets around midnight, one in the morning, and  I just can't sleep.  So if I could just have that going on a loop, oh, out like a light.  All right.  So the necessary meeting, yes?  So, Roland had an event yesterday that he was permitted to be excused from the meeting.  Delicious food there, too.  So this was completely okayed by Talon and everybody down.  So Bladderhead saw Roland downstairs when the meeting had started. 
[00:30:00]  I've waited for the Talon department.  I'm sorry.  Just wait for people.  Commodery.  And I was just, I was goofing around.  Commodery.  I don't know.  I was goofing around that he wiggled his way out of the meeting.  And then I just, I should have realized who I was goofing around with.  What did you say?  I said he wiggled his way out of the meeting.  No, no, no.  You said he was bragging to you about not being in the meeting.  Oh, he was.  Yes, he was.  And, and, and I was jealous that he was able to get out of the meeting.  Right, right.  You said he was laughing, saying, ha ha, I don't have to go to the meeting. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  So what's the spin?  No, that's what I said.  All right.  Why would you say that?  Because I was jealous.  Yeah, but, you know, there's one thing being jealous is another, like, you know, ratting someone  out there.  Yeah, but he had a free permit to get out of the meeting.  Yeah.  It's some people, you can't hate on the guy just because he did something that, that you  didn't, weren't able to do.  And, you know, sometimes you just got to look and go, ah, I wish, but I'll keep my mouth  shut.  Right.  Yeah.  If you were in the mob, boy.  Yeah.  And you got back to Roland.  So what'd you say about Troy? 
[00:31:00]  I want to see Troy one no more.  He's a Quanratito.  Quanratito.  I don't even know what that is.  I don't know.  You said there's no difference between Troy and a rat, right?  That's correct.  But you're okay now.  Yes.  Until when?  What?  Until when?  Until my revenge plot is acted on.  No, I'm fine.  Is he invited to the pizza party?  He is invited to the pizza party.  Is he still going to be DJing the pizza party?  He's invited to the pizza party.  Are you really DJing his pizza party?  Yeah.  I have a whole set ready to go. 
[00:31:30]  See, it's like...  He's got a whole set?  See, pizza brings people together.  Whole DJ set.  What kind of music did you pick for, like, the pizza party?  Just more upbeat, more clubby kind of shit.  Clubby stuff.  You know?  Just going to keep the people moving out on the dance floor.  You know?  Dance floor.  And it's...  This office is like...  Excuse me.  Can I squeeze past you?  I need some pizza.  Where's the pepperoni?  I want the meatball and pepperoni slice. 
[00:32:00]  There's not even room for ten pies in that office.  Where are the pies going to be?  There's no room in the office to lay them around.  By the top of the printer in a special corner.  What?  Why?  I don't know.  On top of the printer by the corner.  I heard on top of the painter's bush.  He says that I...  Okay.  You've got to speak Roland.  All right.  Well, Sam, when you get some audio, I want to see what the...  The place is doing as far as this pizza party goes. 
[00:32:30]  If they're talking about it.  Everybody's talking about it.  It's the event of the year.  Okay.  Holy shit.  Plus, everybody's very confused.  Nobody understands why this is even happening.  I mean...  Roland's just a guy who books guests.  Well, morale.  Morale is low.  Throwing a company party.  It doesn't make any sense.  It's just an employee.  He's not even allowed to make that decision.  It doesn't make any sense.  He's just doing it. 
[00:33:00]  It really is.  He's usurping management.  I love it.  Well, the place needs more Rollins.  It really does.  This is going to make management feel like they have to throw pizza parties.  Well, they better.  And it better be better than Rollins.  He's forcing their hand.  Yes.  All right.  Well, we'll have an update on the pizza party later today.  Or certainly tomorrow we'll get the scoop on how it went down.  Make sure you get a lot of video.  All right. 
[00:33:30]  Should we take our first break?  Yeah.  Why not?  See what the fuck's going on in the world after the break?  Why not?  I do know we have a voicemail from Mike Starr.  Really?  Yes.  The original basis of Alice in Chains, who's now dead.  A voicemail?  Yeah.  A voicemail for his drug dealer the night before his death.  Yee.  How'd that get out so fast?  I don't know.  We'll get to the bottom of that.  We'll find out how that got out next.  And Sam brought me and you, Ant, a gift this morning. 
[00:34:00]  This is a gift.  It's called A Few Minutes from Kathy Lee and Hoda.  All you need is a few minutes.  This is a precious gift, my friend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because we think this is the worst show on TV.  Slash best.  Yeah.  Slash best.  And I can't believe this is actually on TV.  Yeah.  Not just TV.  It's on NBC, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  And they try to sell it as the extension of the Today Show.  Right.  Which is a big time staple, as we all know.  They call that the bitch hour, though.  They call it the bitch hour.  Yeah.  If you're a celebrity and you're booked on the hour, they call it the bitch hour. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, you're like, oh, I'm on the bitch hour.  Oh, really?  Oh, look at this little inside info there.  So, like, when people are booked, they're like, oh, Graham booked on the bitch hour.  This show is so horrible, I don't know why everyone is not watching it.  Just to see how horrendously bad this is.  The shit they were talking about and just how they were doing it, it is such babble.  Yeah, I can't wait to do this.  Just babble.  Maybe we'll do it after the break.  Oh, I would love to.  A few minutes from Kathy Lee and Hoda, and that's all you need, too. 
[00:35:00]  That's all you need.  Just a couple minutes.  What you need is the first, if you want to take a peek, the first ten minutes.  That's where this is from.  It's gold every morning.  It's gold.  Because then after that.  The best.  After that, the suits get involved.  Like, all right, you've got to, like, do an interview or something.  A segment.  Or you've got to cook some shit for everybody.  Yeah.  But the first ten minutes when they're just babbling is just gold every morning.  I'm seeing questions here, and I've been curious about this.  When are we getting back the results of young Sam's heritage? 
[00:35:30]  Heritage DNA test.  Any day now.  Any day now.  I've been hearing that for a while.  Right.  But I've been in touch with the president of the company.  And Barack Obama?  Yeah.  They can't figure it out either, right?  Yeah.  They're having a really tough time with this one.  Very tough time.  They've requested, you know, more help.  But I was told on Friday that it would be two to three days.  So figure two to three days.  Then they mail it here.  And then we should have it by the end of the week. 
[00:36:00]  And then we'll know.  And then we'll know.  Is Troy Kwan going to be spinning his Charlie Sheen song at the pizza party?  People want to know.  Do you think he's going to shoot one in that end?  Probably.  Probably.  Like, hey people, look at this.  So the bubble machine, Troy Kwan spinning, ten pies.  Cookies, cake.  Cookies, cake, and possibly a bouncer to make sure.  And Dr. Pepper.  Yeah, and Diet Dr. Pepper, to quote Roland, for those of us watching our calories.  What about bitches?  Ah, wait a minute.  What about chicks coming to this thing? 
[00:36:30]  I might be counting.  That sounds thrilling.  Is that where the hot ones hang out?  Yeah, accounting.  That's good.  Because on this floor, not so much.  A couple.  You've got a couple.  Not so much.  You're not staying late enough to when the new interns arrive, I think.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Interns.  And here's what you've got to do.  You've got to say, there's a couple of good ones.  Right.  And that way, if anyone hears, they go, well, I'm one of the good ones.  Yeah, you're safe.  Yeah, as they're shoving that pizza in their face. 
[00:37:00]  They're all good ones.  We've gone to the interns.  They're all good ones.  Oh, really?  Absolutely.  How about some, this thread?  They are all good ones.  This thread sucks without pictures.  Thread useless without pics.  Yeah, we need pics.  You know what?  And I would try to do that, but she'll catch me, and then I'll just be the creep that tried  taking a picture of her, or them, whatever.  We need pics.  Right to HR.  Yeah.  We need pics.  But saying there's a couple of hot ones means we don't get a meeting with HR anytime soon.  And I like it that way.  Yeah.  I don't even know who HR is.  We do.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  If they walked by, I wouldn't even know. 
[00:37:30]  We'd all say hi to them.  17 years doing this insane show without one meeting with HR.  That is a new record, my friends.  All right.  We'll come back with our gift from Sam, a few minutes with Kathie Lee and Hoda, and the  Mike Starr voicemail the night before he died.  Yeah.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  It's the virus.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We were just discussing what was the greatest unplugged of all time. 
[00:38:00]  MTV's unplugged.  I used to like Nirvana as my number one unplugged of all time.  I'm going with this right here.  Yeah.  Alice in Chains.  And now I think Alice in Chains over Nirvana, which is tough.  It's a toss-up.  And then Danny throws in the mix, STP. 
[00:38:30]  Let's not forget that.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  I think that was the first time that they played Big Empty.  I think they premiered it on MTV Unplugged.  Oh, damn.  Really?  It's a big song.  I like that stuff.  Alice in Chains Unplugged was so fucking good, though.  Any other ones to throw in the mix?  I'm trying to think.  Any other ones to throw in the mix?  Wow, that's so many.  I'm looking at the list of all these Unplugged.  Yeah.  Unplugged.  I invented those.  Who? 
[00:39:00]  Who?  What about Paul McCartney?  Yeah, I don't even remember that.  Did he do the chinga-dinga-dinga-dinga song?  No, that wasn't right.  That was a little before that, huh?  Now, McCartney was 91, so...  Wow.  The series went away in what year?  It didn't make it out of the 90s, right?  Oh, I guess it...  No, I guess it did.  Right to the...  Really?  2,000 to the present.  Let me see that section.  Oh, there's a lot.  Yeah.  All right.  They kind of brought it back, I guess.  Wow, no one's really watching this, huh?  They're bringing back Beavis and Butthead. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, I know.  I wonder how good that'll be.  And they're going to be...  Yeah, they're going to be doing, like, YouTube clips also and shit.  Real smart.  I'm hoping that it's a good thing.  Yeah.  The most frustrating thing about Beavis and Butthead is you can't buy the fucking DVDs  the way you want to see it.  Well...  No, I understand.  I've seen a few...  I've seen a few recently with the videos.  They're fucking hysterical.  Of course they're hysterical.  It's the only reason to pick up the DVD. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my God.  It really is the only reason.  No, but I got fucked a few times.  I'm in a Best Buy or Tower Records when they were around, and I'm like,  Oh, Beavis and Butthead, fuck yeah.  And I literally bought all of them.  Oh, God.  And then you bring them home, and you're like...  Just the show.  It's just the show.  And you think that you're getting something really good or exactly what you want  because it's titled, it's Beavis and Butthead, the Mike Judge Collection.  So you're like, oh, my God.  This has to be everything I want.  I got you.  And then I brought it home, and then sure enough, there's no videos.  Look, I like the cartoon.  You know, yes. 
[00:40:30]  But that whole show is about them fucking making fun of videos,  and that shit isn't on the DVDs legally.  And not only that, but there's really just not enough plot  to make an episode of Beavis and Butthead really, really cool without the videos.  Yeah, you need the videos.  Because then it shows, okay, they're hanging out.  All right, they're going to the store.  Okay, they want non-alcoholic beer.  Okay, Todd comes and throws them in the truck.  Can we agree?  That was just filler in between them goofing on videos.  We all know that.  Goofing on videos was the best.  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you.  I saw some, and it's just a torrent of laughs. 
[00:41:00]  Just bear with me for a second.  This guy's been calling for three or four straight days.  Really?  Greg in Jersey.  Greg.  Greg.  Two straight days.  How you doing, Greg?  Oh.  All right, you've been calling.  What do you got?  Your buck.  I threw a dollar out into the public, I don't know, over a year ago.  You're saying you found it?  Yeah.  All right.  How are you going to prove it? 
[00:41:30]  I can drive up.  Uh-oh.  Hey, you got a cell phone, buddy?  Yeah.  Why don't you take a picture of the dollar and send it in right now?  Hey, there you go.  All right.  All right, what number do I give it to?  We'll put you on hold, and we'll let you on hold.  Where'd you find the dollar?  We'll give you some info.  At a bank.  At a bank.  See, I think the guy's full of shit.  What, did you get a dollar?  Did you say, could I have a dollar, please?  No, I'm not full of shit.  I'll tell you right now. 
[00:42:00]  If you got the dollar bill I released over a year ago, yeah, I'll give you $10,000.  No problem.  Sounds good.  I just don't think you have it.  Take a picture.  Take a picture.  All right.  What would happen if I didn't have it?  You're just trying to get on the air.  We knew this ahead of time.  That's why we weren't fucking going to you.  But you had a call every day.  What do you really want to say?  Yeah, go ahead.  No, I need $10,000 to do something that I need to do.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm right. 
[00:42:30]  Jesus.  I promise, though, it's really fucking cool.  What, you made it look good?  Fucking Jerry Lundergaard over here.  He can't fucking.  He needs the money.  What do you need $10,000 for?  We're not going to beat you, caller.  Nothing.  Nothing family rate.  Nothing like that.  But I found out a way.  You guys don't think I'm nuts.  Who the fuck are you?  Well, we already think you're nuts because you think you found my dollar.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I think we know what happened after that now.  But I found out a way.  What do you mean you think you know what happened to that?  That I lied. 
[00:43:00]  No, we know you lied.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  But I set up that thing legit.  I mean, if someone can find it, I'll give them $10,000.  But go ahead.  We knew you didn't have it.  That's why we didn't want to take this call.  But now you got our attention.  What's up?  What's up?  This is my last chance.  I've been wanting to do this for years before I grew up to med school.  I want to build the world's first compact, portable, inertial electrostatic confinement  nuclear fusion reactor.  That's not even fucking invented yet. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, it is.  What?  Yeah.  There's a group.  There's 52 people, individuals in the world that have made their own nuclear fusion, not  fission, fusion reactor.  Oh, fusion.  Okay.  I know how to do it, and it can fit inside a suitcase.  A suitcase.  And what kind of power are we talking?  You'd have to get it up to about 30,000 kilovolts.  I'm sorry, 330 kilovolts.  How are you making the actual power? 
[00:44:00]  Because nukes usually have to heat up water and a steam turbine.  How are you doing that?  Yeah, this is completely different.  Instead of using the heavy, you know, uranium stuff that's heavy, you can do fusion because  it's lighter.  The hydrogen atom is the lightest one.  So that's the easiest to get it.  And when you get it and you increase the voltage and you increase the heat, they get enough  energy to combine and form helium and an extra neutron. 
[00:44:30]  I really wish.  I'm not even joking.  I have an entire business plan that I have to do.  Why would we want to support that?  Couldn't this fit in a car?  In a briefcase.  Yeah, yeah, but couldn't this then power a car?  No.  Like Mr. Fusion?  No.  The highest efficiency rating for any nuclear fusion reactor has been 65%.  To get the energy, to recover the energy, you would need lithium in a molten lead solution 
[00:45:00]  outside of the reactor.  Is this self-powering?  Let me ask you a question.  If you're so smart, why can't, how come your big plan to come up with 10 grand was so shitty?  Because that's the only way I could figure out to do it.  I have no job.  Steal what you need from the Libyans.  No, you should go to Libya.  Try to make some kind of deal.  The Libyans!  He knows exactly what he wants to build, but then his big plan was, I'm just going to call  a radio show and try to say I won a contest.  Just ask him for 10 grand. 
[00:45:30]  Getting the 10 grand is the hardest part.  Well, what are you going to do with the 10 grand?  What do you actually have to buy with the 10 grand?  What do I have to buy with the 10 grand?  I have to buy two Transformers.  First Transformer gets it up.  They're cheap.  You get them at Toys R Us.  No, no.  Oh.  Why would you want an O&A fan to walk around with a nuclear device?  A nuclear device in a suitcase and then make it where it's so easy for anyone else to do.  I want to be able to sleep at night.  It's tough to sleep at night as it is.  Where are you getting the nuclear material, sir? 
[00:46:00]  I'm absolutely not even joking.  I've been wanting to do this for years.  But yeah, where are you getting the nuclear material?  The nuclear material isn't radioactive.  It's deuterium.  Deuterium.  So where do you get deuterium?  You can buy it.  You don't need any...  At the deuterium shoppy?  Deuterium.  At the little ye olde deuterium shoppy.  Deuterium is not radioactive.  You can buy it from any gas company.  It's not radioactive.  So where is the reaction taking place?  How is that happening? 
[00:46:30]  How does the reaction take place?  Yeah.  A major voltage.  You have to get up to about 30,000 volts.  All right.  Now where is the power coming from to get the 30,000 volts?  The battery.  The thing is, when you get up to 30,000 volts, the current is about 5 milliamps, which translates into less than 10 watts.  So, but now the thing will be self-powering once it starts from the battery?  Once it starts from the battery, it will be self-powering.  Do you realize this is the dream of everybody was to have some type of self-sustaining power supply that can power itself and a little more to then power something else? 
[00:47:00]  It hasn't been invented yet.  The only one, the longest self-powering nuclear fusion reactor that's worked is 0.5 seconds.  But that is a different kind of fusion reactor.  That's fair.  And you came up with something new.  No, no.  This isn't new at all.  This type of reactor was developed in the 40s.  You're trying to raise money through a radio program. 
[00:47:30]  That's why I'm saying.  You can't get a government grant on this one?  What about a government grant?  What you're talking about is fantastic.  Hey, could you put a wow sticker on the briefcase?  Yeah, please.  Please.  Yeah, I have no problem.  I will fucking do it.  A guy in Brooklyn did it, and it took up about...  What do you mean a guy in Brooklyn?  There's a guy in Brooklyn that figured this shit out, too?  Yeah, 32 years old guy in Brooklyn.  You can Google it right now as we're talking.  Google it.  Google it.  Why do crazies listen to us? 
[00:48:00]  I love this.  Let me go to Jared in Utah.  You're on with Greg in Jersey.  Go ahead, Jared.  Guy in Brooklyn.  I heard this guy's hustle several years ago on an AM radio in Northern California, and  he's not very good at this hustle.  He's going to end up asking everybody to send him money for a little while, in a little while.  I'm just curious to see what his clothes is on this deal.  Yeah, believe me, I'm no nuclear physicist here by any stretch of the imagination, but 
[00:48:30]  I do know a little bit about...  Well, you're pretty good at it.  ...cold fusion and...  Cold fusion is fake.  Cold fusion was a big thing that happened.  Right, and it's a myth.  It's not happening.  All they did was they put electrolysis through deuterated water and said...  Deuterated water.  Toilet bowl one.  That was a lie.  That never worked.  That was a big sign.  But yours is different. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, it's been made.  I'm not making a single new thing.  Nothing that I'm doing is new.  I'm just...  Everybody else has done it before.  The 52 people, they have done it and optimized just to get neutrons.  If you optimize it for portability, I'll get very little neutrons, but it'll still happen.  And what could this power right now?  It cannot power anything.  It can only power itself.  There's not a single fusion...  All right. 
[00:49:30]  We got an electrical engineer on the line here.  Oh, electrical engineer.  Dan in Cleveland.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  So, I just wanted to figure out his figures there.  So, you said it's 30,000 volts, right?  Yeah.  Correct.  How do you compute...  How do you get power?  What times what equals power?  What times what equals power?  Yeah.  Current times volts.  Very basic component.  Current times volts.  Okay.  So, what's 30,000 times 5 milliamps? 
[00:50:00]  Why 5 million?  What's that?  What are the units for the 5 million?  You said...  What's the unit?  It's amps.  Milliamps.  It's 1,000 of an amp.  You said it's 5 watts that you're getting.  How do you get from 30,000 volts times 5 milliamps?  Basic math is 5 times 3 is 15.  Where the hell do you get 5 watts?  Where do I get the 5 watts?  You're insane.  You're absolutely insane.  This guy owns an ohm meter. 
[00:50:30]  Look out.  He owns an ohm meter.  It's two numbers you multiply together.  It doesn't come out to 5 watts.  So, where is he going to get the 1.121 gigawatts?  Tell me.  What does it come out to then?  What did you get?  What was your number?  3 times 5.  Basic math.  What did you get?  I'm nervous right now, and you've got a calculator in front of you.  What did you get, though? 
[00:51:00]  I don't have a calculator in front of me to know where 3 times 5 is, you prick.  I love this.  How do you write out 5 milliamps in decimals?  By the way, I'm the decimal guy that talked to Jimmy about ones and zeros.  Oh, well, look at that.  Wow, look at you.  This is like Mr. Wizard, only retarded.  Yeah.  We've got the article on the guy that made a homemade device in Brooklyn, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the article we got.  Thanks to Vincent Bayon. 
[00:51:30]  He's a young guy.  He's like 32, something like that.  We Googled the guy.  Yeah, but this electrical engineer is calling Bravo Sierra.  Yeah.  Bravo Sierra.  Danny's scanning the article right now for the pertinent information about the Brooklyn guy.  Bravo Sierra on basic mathematics.  That's all I'm calling out for.  Okay.  Well, it's not like it's never been done.  It's been 52 times.  We're 37.  We're 37 times.  This guy's got his numbers all mixed up.  How is it done? 
[00:52:00]  Thank you, Dan.  Let me see.  How is it done?  No, no, no.  Not you.  We're reading the article.  Honestly, it's really, I mean, the guy's saying, everything the guy said is pretty much in this article.  It says that this guy's reactor does not generate any more power than he puts into it, so it's not this miracle machine.  Uh-huh.  But it's sort of perpetual, almost perpetual motion, though.  No, it's not perpetual motion because it's not generating energy.  It's not generating, but if it generates self-sustaining energy.  What happens, Anthony? 
[00:52:30]  I know you get it.  What happens is when you start the reaction and the chemicals heat up.  Right.  The problem is when they heat up, gases expand, and then it can't sustain itself because it's not enough pressure.  So it does lose.  Yeah.  So what happens is it heats up.  They get close.  It gets so hot.  They shoot out inside the reactor to the edges of the reactor, and then they come back in because they've cooled down, and they can do it again.  Okay.  So why would you make one if it's been done 37 times? 
[00:53:00]  Because it's never been done in a portable version.  Anthony, we've got a biochemist that wants in.  All right.  I didn't realize we had such smart people listening to these dick jokes.  I know.  This shows our audience.  First of all, I'm an undergrad at Drexel Biology, and I just got my master's in biomedical science at UMDMJ.  All right.  I went to John Glenn High School.  And what are you going to do with this device?  Is it for good or bad?  Yeah.  No, it's only for good.  Are you an EVL villain?  Yeah, are you going to be EVL? 
[00:53:30]  No.  Are we going to have to find Spider-Man eventually?  Yeah.  No, you can't do any bad with it.  It's a different kind.  All right.  Let me go to John, who's a biochemist.  John.  Hi.  Hi, let's be on Anthony.  How are you doing?  Pretty good, John.  This guy is a complete bunt.  First off, this is perpetual motion.  It's the very definition of perpetual motion in modern times.  These scams have been running through the Internet since the Internet was created.  You know, it became popular 20 years ago. 
[00:54:00]  First off, deuterium is not nuclear.  It's just heavy water.  Yeah, that's what I said.  Yeah.  Okay.  But you said it's nuclear.  No, I didn't.  You repeatedly said it's nuclear.  No, I didn't.  I said deuterium is not nuclear.  You can buy it anywhere.  Okay, but you said it was...  I've never seen deuterium for sale.  Buy it anywhere.  I hear you can.  I wish we had interns.  I would send one out and say, bring us back some deuterium.  I think the feds would have a problem with that.  I don't think you could just buy it anywhere.  Yeah, you can.  The parts list that I have, and I'm already going. 
[00:54:30]  Where can you buy it?  You get a company called Airgas, A-I-R-G-A-S.  They sell gas to a bunch of different places, all labs, all stuff.  Airgas.  Is that true?  I already have my parts list.  Is that true biochemist?  Yeah, no, it is true.  You can buy it online.  You can also buy it through scientific shops, especially.  So I've used deuterium many, many times.  It's useful for certain types of experiments that you're doing.  Water on the lawn?  But it doesn't do anything that regular water doesn't do.  It tastes like regular water.  It feels like regular water. 
[00:55:00]  It just weighs a slight bit more than regular water.  What is it, got an extra atom in there?  Extra neutron.  Extra neutron.  How the hell could water weigh more than other water?  It's got extra neutron.  Those things are a little heavy.  How much more heavy?  I can tell you that.  11% heavier.  11% heavier.  Do you feel it if it was in your pool, Ant?  I think you would.  You'd probably feel it.  You would feel it?  It would probably feel a little thick. 
[00:55:30]  You know when you jump off your diving board and you go all the way to the other end underwater?  Would it feel a bit heavier?  Is there more buoyancy in the heavy water?  No.  No.  The buoyancy comes from electrostatics.  So if you had seen, I have the buoyancy in the...  I love this.  I love this.  Morons.  The buoyancy comes from the displacement of the equivalent mass of the body.  It has nothing to do with electrostatics.  You clearly don't even have a high school science education. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, snap.  All right.  Face.  Biomedical science masters.  Now, what do you say that I'm saying wrong?  Master.  The guy that said, I got a high school.  A biomedical science believes that buoyancy is due to electrostatics.  Really?  Please.  Stop the Bravo Sierra crop.  It's water.  Is it more dense than regular water?  No.  Oh, then, okay.  Then the buoyancy thing goes out the fucking window. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Now, okay.  So you got this deuterium water, right?  Yep.  And you put an electrical charge through it.  Yes.  And it gets superheated and blasts off some fucking neutrons?  Plasma, yeah.  So what happens is the deuterium is in the chamber.  The potential, the electron potential, is about 30,000 volts in between.  Uh-huh.  The gas is in between the two electrodes.  And when that high field is exposed to deuterium, it breaks off and separates into ions. 
[00:57:00]  Okay.  And then that ricochets around in there and keeps the fucking liquid hot?  Some, yes.  Some ions are positive.  Some ions are positive.  How does it prevent heat loss through the liquid?  Right.  Aw, shit.  There has to be some dissipation of heat, which is energy loss.  There's no dissipation.  How is there no dissipation?  There's no dissipation of heat because it's in a vacuum.  You can't transfer heat. 
[00:57:30]  In a vacuum.  One of those fucking whirly ones.  Yes, I like that.  I like the one with the ball.  A hoover?  He's building a machine for e-veal.  E-veal.  This sounds like a very e-veal project.  Yes, this is very e-veal.  It's not e-veal at all.  It's not e-veal at all.  How do you know it doesn't...  Do you have a goatee and a beret?  Yeah.  How do you know it doesn't get into e-veal's hands?  Yeah.  Where you leave it just laying around willy-nilly and then someone that's very e-veal grabs it?  Nobody's going to grab it. 
[00:58:00]  But the thing with the...  Oh, okay.  No one's going to grab it.  No one's going to grab it.  Just lock it up to a light pole like a bike.  Yeah, this amazing machine.  There would be no interest from people that want to do harm to everyone.  Opie, the thing with the fission and the bombs that you're thinking about, those things have to be controlled.  Those fission reactors and the reactors and the bombs, all that stuff is to keep the reaction under control.  If it wasn't under control, then it would go, right?  But if this fusion reaction isn't under control, it just stops. 
[00:58:30]  So let me ask you something.  So the heat doesn't transfer out because of the vacuum?  The heat does not transfer out because of the vacuum.  Now what about...  Wait, wait.  How do we get heat from the sun if space is a vacuum?  Because the fusion reactor produces x-rays and neutrons.  And that is what it's getting and produces heat.  Hey, guys.  But so does the sun.  How big is this battery? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What kind of battery are we talking?  I have a small one.  You can get one from Radio Shack.  It doesn't need to be...  Oh, wow.  Radio Shack.  It doesn't have to be a big battery.  You're crazy.  I'm not crazy.  But why $10,000 from me, man?  It seems like the community that you're part of, someone would be like, oh, fuck.  Well, we could get $10,000 for this.  Why from you?  Because I've had...  You know sometimes in your life when you get that drive that you just know that you're supposed 
[00:59:30]  to do something and you've got to do it now.  Oh, boy.  You can't go to sleep.  You have Timothy McVeigh.  Son of Sam.  Son of Sam.  No, it's not like that.  Sama Bin Laden.  This guy on Twitter just writes, yeah, nothing wrong with funding a lunatic to build a nuclear  reactor in a bridge case.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.  Joey Mengele.  Fuck you, Joey.  That's funny.  Nuclear fusion reactor.  A lot of people have done it.  Okay, but...  I did it in high school. 
[01:00:00]  You said that you're going to med school, right?  Yeah.  So, you have some money.  Why don't you just build it?  There you go.  I have no money.  I'm jobless right now.  I have no money.  So, you're going to med school.  And I think if the word got out that we funded this, I think we might lose our jobs.  Yeah.  The company would not be comfortable with that.  What's the practical use for this?  Why are you building it?  It's...  For a lot of other people, it's been a hobby. 
[01:00:30]  And for me, it's something that I want to do.  Evil!  You want to do.  Evil!  Evil!  But what is the practical use for this?  The practical use is just like the...  It's the end result of any hobby.  You enjoy the construction.  You enjoy building it.  And you enjoy the end.  Get Legos.  Well, then the hobby is going to end up in the attic with the rest of the hobbies.  And then someone of evil nature is going to come around...  Evil!  ...and grab it.  Yes.  All right.  Well, how about if I'm done with it, I'll give it back to you.  It's not a big deal.  Oh, yeah.  We need that around here. 
[01:01:00]  We do.  That's good.  I think the lawyers would have a problem with a fucking nuclear device running perpetually  in their building.  In a briefcase.  Yeah.  It's not like that at all.  I understand.  There's plenty of YouTube videos online of guys putting up their reactors.  You can see it.  It has a ball of...  And does it start bubbling?  No, it doesn't bubble.  So this has already been done, so...  Yeah, it's already been done.  So you're not the guy.  No, it's been done.  But he's doing it in a briefcase. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, I see.  Can you get this through airport security if you put it on that little conveyor belt  on your carry-on?  I can take that anywhere.  Do you think they'd...  Do you think they'd look and go like, hmm, I think we better pull this guy offline?  We got very good news for Greg in Jersey.  We got Mr. Mysterio.  Mr. Mysterio?  Mr. Mysterio, you're on with Greg.  Well, hello, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hello, Mr. Mysterio.  Yes, I would love...  My group and I would love to fund this lovely young gentleman. 
[01:02:00]  Really?  The money he needs for his nuclear...  Bomb?  It's not a bomb.  His nuclear bomb.  So Mr. Mysterio, what would you use this for?  Let's just say that we would not use it for anything bad.  Nothing horrendous.  We would just blow up buses, trains, the country... 
[01:02:30]  Well, that sounds like evil.  We don't want this in the hands of evil.  No, this can't fall into the hands of evil.  Wait a minute.  No, we're going to raise bunnies.  Bunnies.  Ah, keep some warm.  Please pop up one of the YouTube videos of one of the other guys.  It doesn't get warm?  This whole thing doesn't get warm at all?  No, pull the video up.  It really doesn't get warm.  There's plenty of YouTube videos of amateurs...  Yeah, how are we going to know that they're not warm through a video? 
[01:03:00]  How do you know they're not warm?  Because you can touch the glass.  Are you worried that you're going to be assassinated now by the government?  No.  No, not at all.  No, okay.  You're going to put a ricin pellet in your fucking thigh.  This guy needs money for a boat.  See what you started, man?  Oh.  This guy needs money for a drug binge in Vegas.  Is the boat going to be used for evil?  I don't know.  I don't need money for a boat.  I'm talking about everyone else that needs money now because of you.  You know, this thing could expand and open a gateway to hell, you crazy man. 
[01:03:30]  That's true.  And then we'd have to deal with fucking Satan and spirits and things.  That would be scary.  All right, here's this guy.  All right.  You know what it looks like?  A little pretty good now.  It's like one of those things you could buy at Spencer Gifts.  10 volts input.  Plasma lights.  15 volts input.  20 volts input.  This is semi-stable. 
[01:04:00]  Occasionally there's a very echo reset when we try to draw too much current.  It's limited to about 5 amps.  And when we last checked, our chamber pressure is about 25 microns.  25 microns?  Which is 25 militor for you.  Militor?  I don't know about him.  He was evil.  I hate to see this guy's electric bill.  I know.  It's like me during the summer for my pool.  This allows us to view it on our screen remotely.  Oh.  Just in case it explodes.  Right, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Because right now we're probably putting out about 8,000.  This is probably about 8,000 volts acceleration voltage.  And right now we have our diffusion pump and our mechanical pump running.  Uh-huh.  Like I said, when we last checked, it was about 25 microns of chamber pressure.  And it was slowly dropping.  I have the slide valve for the diffusion pump open just enough that it's dropping some.  So we should hopefully observe our plasma changing.  And as we get to a deeper vacuum, we can increase our acceleration voltage.  And then what? 
[01:05:00]  So that we're not drawing too much current.  The problem is at higher pressure is you draw too much current even when you try to put your voltage up.  As you can see, we just have a crude grid in there right now.  It's actually just made of bailing wire, what we had on hand.  We'll eventually make something more permanent.  Yes.  See if I can zoom in a little bit without shaking things too much.  Okay, so that's containing the plasma.  I hate science.  Oh, God.  I really just ponder it. 
[01:05:30]  It's actually showing up a little bit.  It's bluish.  All right.  I wish you could see it, how it was in there.  I don't know what this does.  What are we looking at?  What is it for?  What are we looking for?  I don't even know what video you guys just pulled up.  What are you looking for, sir?  Well, you pulled up the fusion reactor video on YouTube.  Yeah.  I don't know which one you specifically pulled up, but you did see an inner grid that was  kind of circular, a thin wire.  Yes.  That's one of the electrodes.  Of course it is. 
[01:06:00]  And the other electrode is the actual metal shell.  So the shell itself is an electrode, and that inner grid, circles and thin wire.  Right.  That's where you apply the high voltages.  Uh-huh.  And to start it.  And then how does it switch over from battery to self-sustaining?  From battery to self-sustaining?  That is the biggest challenge.  And what I decided to do is, do you see everybody else's reactor in the big room?  They had the big power.  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy. 
[01:06:30]  You want to put it in a fucking carry-on bag.  Yes.  And how I can do that is, do you guys know how tasers?  Yes, with capacitors.  They have extremely high voltages but low milliamps?  Yes.  I can put a series of taser parts in line and have reached those voltages and currents.  And that dial, I don't know what video you guys have got, but did you see him turn a dial?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the dial is turning.  A lot of dials.  Just like people are doing with their radios right now. 
[01:07:00]  If I make it old school.  Hold on.  We got the fugitive.  He wants in.  What?  The fugitive.  This is a fugitive.  Yes.  I want to get my hands on this ball.  I mean.  I think you might be part of that evil thing.  All right.  Well, his hand that he had on that dial is a mariac.  That changes the voltage from zero. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  Let's say you know what you're doing.  I don't have fucking money for this.  Ten grand.  You know what?  One of my family members hit me up yesterday.  I'm a little low right now.  I'm going to give you ten grand, and all you're going to do is give me a suitcase full of old taser parts?  No.  No, not old taser parts.  Old pinball machine parts.  People are begging that we talk about the pizza party some more.  They're begging us, man.  They're begging.  Boy, nuclear pizza party.  Are you trying to tell me that you made nuclear fusion out of a suitcase? 
[01:08:00]  This is pretty heavy, Doc.  They're killing you on Twitter, bro.  Let's say.  Now, wait a minute.  That's fine.  Dr. Steve, who you know is a...  Asshole face?  Asshole face.  In his own right, he's a physicist in his own right.  This is horse shit.  These things are glorified light bulbs. 
[01:08:30]  So why...  Call Kaku.  Get them on the phone.  Make them useful for once.  Oh, I forgot.  He's got that.  That's what he says.  Glorified light bulb.  Well, let's get Dr. Steve on the line.  I can't believe we're still talking about this.  So are you talking...  Is this pretty much a cathode and an anode and a reaction between the two?  Yes.  All right.  That's been done plenty of times.  You don't even need detortium water.  And I think you said earlier, is he just building stuff for Spencer Gifts? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, you're building that thing that you touch and the little light goes off into the globe on your fingers.  You're going to go, oh, cool.  I wouldn't mind one of those, but not for $10,000.  I like Dr. Steve, but it's not that what you guys are kind of personified as.  It just isn't.  It's a glorified light bulb.  People want to know if you could stick your cock in this thing after you build it.  That'd be nice.  And the plasma being released is energy from the battery.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Yes, the plasma being released is released from the potential voltage.  All right, we've got another smarty on the line here.  John in Queens.  John, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hello.  Hey, dude, stop being stupid because those things on YouTube, those things are just electrolysis reactors.  Right.  And they're no different than taking a stun gun and putting it underwater, and that's the light you see.  Right.  If you want to be smart, you could take bacteria.  There are certain types of bacteria.  And if you feed them like food and human waste, they actually produce diesel fuel, and that's something that you should invest your money. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, wait a minute.  This guy sounds evil.  Bacteria.  It's some kind of germ warfare going on, I think.  I'm sorry.  What was the guy that just called it?  It doesn't matter.  No, no.  He's talking about electrolysis.  He's Mr. X.  The guy that just called it about the electrolysis, that's a whole confusion.  Electrolysis.  And it was a big problem. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, hold on.  If you've got that big-ass escalate, wouldn't you like taking your pool and being able to make diesel fuel in the backyard?  Or being able to make gas in the backyard?  Don't you want bacteria and human waste all over your backyard?  Why?  There's human waste.  I know that.  In that jacuzzi after a weekend.  I know there's a lot of human waste.  I've invited some human waste over the house.  Just being in there.  Being in there is human waste.  It's the definitive human waste.  What's this guy's response to what I just said about it being a big-ass electrolysis reactor? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Reactor just means a reaction's going on.  It doesn't necessarily mean nuclear.  I understand that.  Sir, the electrolysis that you were talking about?  Yeah.  Do you understand that you have to have a huge tokamak the size of a fucking school building in order to control a fusion reaction?  Do you understand that the sun took 10 million degrees Kelvin in order to start that reaction?  Do you understand that?  Yes. 
[01:11:30]  The tokamak that you just referenced, it's in the shape of a torte.  It's the one that you think.  It's in the shape of a donut, and the plasma is in the middle.  I'm starving.  We got any donuts back there?  Starving.  Are you working for Iraq?  Or Iran, I should say.  The axis of evil?  I guess Iran would be a better...  Yeah.  Are you working for Iran there, Greg?  No.  The one that that guy just said was the big, giant, tourist one, that uses magnets to confine the gas.  Magnets? 
[01:12:00]  There's no other way to do it without melting down the city.  See, that sounds bad.  That's evil.  That's pure evil.  Yeah, we don't want that.  Right there.  Hold on.  I just want to let you know, this is a black Republican again, and it just so happens I'm a science teacher, so I don't know.  I just have to call up to tell this fucking guy he's an idiot.  Wait, you're...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me let this sink in.  My head is blown, too.  You're a black guy that's a Republican, and you teach science?  I'm a guy who...  Holy shit. 
[01:12:30]  He walked past this guy's reactor and went into the bizarro dimension.  Hold on to the line.  I'm calling the Guinness Book of World Records because you could be the only one on the planet.  Unbelievable.  A black Republican that teaches science.  Are white people punching people at a Burger King right now?  I'm not going to tell you, bro.  Yeah, you guys told me a boo-boo fellow for me while I was speaking.  That was real funny, guys.  I'm sorry, John.  I'm sorry.  That wasn't cool.  No, of course not.  That wasn't cool.  That one that he was just talking about is held in the center of the ring by Mets.  All right. 
[01:13:00]  We got Dr. Steve on the line.  I want to thank John for calling in.  Greg, you're still on the line.  You want $10,000 for me for some fucking nuclear bomb?  He wants a grant.  And I don't have the $10,000, but maybe you get some interest out there for your scam.  Let's hear from Dr. Steve.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  Oh, boy.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  I got your text about shenanigans and bravo, Sierra, as they say.  What's your take on this whole thing, being an amateur physicist as you are?  And an asshole. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, no.  Who said that?  Somebody in the room.  Yeah, I don't know.  Okay, as long as it was in the room, it's okay.  Dr. Steve, I love your show.  I've called him before.  Hey, cool, man.  And look, I like playing around with science shit, too.  But here's the problem.  Dr. Steve, you have?  The amateur, and this includes cold fusion and these so-called, you know, micro-hot fusion devices.  Solner luminescence.  Okay.  When you put a neutron detector next to these things, they output exactly nothing. 
[01:14:00]  And you cannot have fusion without producing neutrons.  And the Solner luminescence one did not, because that how it was debunked.  The Solner luminescence is basically the water with the deuterium in it.  And the researchers decided that if we have deuterium in your reactor.  Yes, deuterium.  The Solner luminescence that you just said, they were not able to detect any extra neutrons above background. 
[01:14:30]  At all.  So there's a Solner luminescence that's been disproved.  So there's no fusion.  The electrolysis, the cold fusion, that's been disproved.  And the fusion reactions, there's only two different ways.  It's the Topamec, and it's the Farnsworth reactor.  Farnsworth?  What is that?  I guess it's Farnsworth invented it.  Really?  The Farnsworth reactor.  The Farnsworth?  Yeah.  So this...  Oh, Kaku, you know what? 
[01:15:00]  I have no standing in this.  It's just that people making fusion in their garages, it's nutty.  It's almost like a doctor making wine in his...  Exactly.  I need some heavy water fluid.  I'm a little nervous that people are making fusion in their garages.  Yeah.  I wish that we could, dude.  Listen, fusion, controlled fusion, will be the answer to everything.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  If it was possible, there would be an end to poverty, an end to, you know, our energy problems.  I mean, this is the Holy Grail.  There's no question.  Well, this guy seems to have it, and he can tote around in a suitcase.  That's right.  No, I won't have the Holy Grail at all.  And Dr. Steve's right.  Where it actually produces energy, produces net energy, they expect it to go back out and do it.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I got to let Dr. Steve go, because we do have Dr. Kaku on the line.  Oh, well, that's great. 
[01:16:00]  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, thank you.  I got to let Dr. Kaku on the line.  We also have a guy that's an expert, because he saw Ocean's Eleven, so we might need him, too.  Dr. Steve.  But first, we got Dr. Kaku.  You're talking to Greg in Jersey, sir.  Hello, boys.  Yeah, this is Dr. Kaku, and I would just like to say, nuclear fusion is like a river, and it flows through time and space.  It's a wonderful thing.  And can you give us a little about this reactor? 
[01:16:30]  Does it work?  No.  All right.  Well, you heard it right there from Dr. Kaku.  You know, we're heard all over the world now, thanks to the WWW out there.  Yeah.  And I want to say hi to somebody in Syria checking in.  Oh, wow.  How about that?  Who's this?  Hello, this is Farouk.  Farouk from Syria.  Hi, Farouk.  Farouk Akbar.  Farouk Akbar.  Okay, what do you got for the show?  I want to throw my turban into the ring. 
[01:17:00]  I need this machine for mischief.  For mischief.  He wants to throw his turban into the ring, and he needs his machine for a little mischief.  For a little mischief.  Yeah, mischief, not evil.  Well, could you define your little mischief?  Yeah, what kind of mischief?  Because we're very protective of this right now.  Um, without being too specific, I plan on taking a little trip.  Um, it involves...  Boy, did I fucking run out of gas.  You started strong with that turban being thrown into the ring and mischief. 
[01:17:30]  I like the mischief part.  We do have Dr. Robotnik.  Dr. Robotnik?  From the Eggman Empire.  Oh, shit.  Uh, not the doc.  Is this you, sir?  Yes.  I'm trying to get that hedgehog.  What do you need?  Do you need this guy's device?  Yes.  I plan to hire him to build a series of egg robots for my Eggman Empire. 
[01:18:00]  Jesus Christ.  There's a lot of evil out there.  There's so much evil listening to us.  It's scary.  There's so evil.  All right.  In the last video that you guys saw, I'll tell you the hardest, the most dangerous effects of it.  Oh.  The video that you guys saw online, where he was visualizing it with a webcam, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, the reason he had to visualize it with a webcam is because the machine does produce x-rays and neutrons.  Is that bad?  So, he had it with a mirror.  So, the mirror, you know, they pass through the mirror, but the light passes and bounces off the mirror into the webcam. 
[01:18:30]  So, there's three dangerous parts to it.  Uh-huh.  X-rays, which will be stopped because it's aluminum.  The neutrons...  Aluminum stops x-rays?  Did not know that.  Yes.  I thought you needed lead.  No, aluminum will stop x-rays.  Why don't we wear aluminum siding when we're getting our x-rays?  Yeah, what the fuck?  It's expensive, and it's...  Why would you...  More expensive than lead?  The lead scares the shit out of me.  Wait a minute.  If I could wear an aluminum siding suit when I'm fucking getting my x-rays in my mouth at the dentist, I'd be pretty happy about it. 
[01:19:00]  It's that heavy lead vest.  Yeah.  It makes it hard to breathe.  You feel like you're having a panic attack.  Yeah.  Well, the three dangerous parts are the x-rays, the neutrons, and the high voltage, which is my biggest concern, is the high voltage.  Dr. Steve says, fuck, you hang up on me for a fake Dr. Kaku?  That's a bad one.  Hey, yes. 
[01:19:30]  Get the hint, asshole.  No.  Dr. West, what's up?  Hello, gentlemen.  I want to...  Oh, Arabic.  Wow.  Well, not necessarily, but let me speak to this gentleman.  I want to fund this project.  Oh, you want to fund it?  Nice.  There you go.  You're getting money.  Saves me 10 grand.  What would he be obligated to give you, sir?  Before I give him anything, I want to ask him several questions to see if he is a serious scientist.  All right.  First question, sir, what will this device do to the blacks? 
[01:20:00]  It won't do anything to the blacks at all.  At all.  Okay.  If I take this device and I place it on my wife's stomach, will it destroy her ovaries?  That's good.  Will it do it with the x-rays?  Yeah, it kind of will.  Yeah, see?  Now it's dangerous.  Can we use this device to build a generation of super kids?  Ah, that's a good question.  I haven't given up on that yet.  Generation of super kids coming from this?  No.  And lastly, sir, in my laboratory, I've got a lot of kittens. 
[01:20:30]  Can I use this device to melt them?  Ah.  That could work.  Just put them in the microwave.  That's it.  That's what I do.  Did you, now, did you first find out about this device by going to Colorado and talking  to Tesla?  No, no.  Can this device make you a duplicate and then make you appear a few feet away?  Oh, spoiler alert, buddy.  Yeah, what are you doing, man?  Not everyone has seen the movie.  Jesus.  It's been forever.  No.  It's the whole movie right there.  I know.  It's great. 
[01:21:00]  I knew the 10 grand would be.  Will it fit in the Pantages across the street?  Ah.  I don't know if this is good.  Vinny from Northwest Indiana just writes, what XM channel is Oprah on?  Is that bad?  Oh, that's bad.  That's bad.  That's bad.  They want the Kathy Lee show.  Yeah.  Sean in North Carolina writes, this call has produced nothing but confusion.  Ah, confusion.  That's the only type of fusion you're creating, sir. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Well, you guys obviously saw the videos online where it works.  You saw the 32-year-old guy, Brooklyn guy, who did it.  Yeah, I don't see it in a suitcase.  It's hard to understand.  I don't see it in a suitcase, sir.  I think we've got to go to Metropolis before we end this.  Metropolis?  Lex, what's going on?  Lex.  Uh-oh.  How are you, Lex?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  I don't know if this is compatible with kryptonite.  I'm building a death ray to take out Superman.  A death ray.  Could you put kryptonite in this and make a death ray, sir?  That's a very good question, Greg. 
[01:22:00]  Krypton.  I don't know, guys.  This is completely serious.  Now he's all serious.  Like, hey, hey, hey.  Don't get silly now.  We've got to keep our listeners any way we can, man.  We've got Hebe Kuykenberger on the line.  Oh, no.  Hebe!  It's been a while, sir.  Guys, why are you talking to this guy?  Why don't you just call my son, David?  My son, David, could do all of this for you.  Don't talk to this guy.  He's a fucking liar.  Just call my David.  Call him.  You have his number.  He's in Area 51.  He's a Kuykenberger. 
[01:22:30]  What's your help, guys?  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  He's in Area 51 with this device.  His son, David.  You guys breaking on that movie for 45 minutes the other day.  It was fucking classic.  It was fucking great, man.  It was fucking classic.  It made me...  Now I have to go watch the movie again.  Oh, watch the awfulness.  It's been too long.  Take those sons of bitches down.  It's every once in a while in your guys' life, you know that you get something that you 
[01:23:00]  just feel like you have to fucking do.  You have to do it, and you'll regret it.  Right, but I don't have the money.  You'll regret it if you don't.  You've got to, I don't know, sell something.  Sell something.  You've got to get out there into the community, the scientific community, and see if they'll give  you any, you know, green.  Maybe sell your body or something.  Yeah, do that.  Hustle.  Give blowjobs to gay men, gay old lonely men, and they'll give you money instantly. 
[01:23:30]  Just a scritch boss.  Yeah, I've looked into other methods of venture capitalists and stuff.  Venture capital, yeah.  It's blowjobs.  Why don't you take it public?  No.  I've tried to get a couple angel investments, which are startup company stuff, but they never  found a reason to make money off of it, and I don't have any desire to make money off  of it.  I just wanted to.  Yeah.  Should we wake up Bob Eatman and ask him if this is a good idea?  He kind of oversees.  Oh, God. 
[01:24:00]  Oversees some of our business dealings.  Hey, Bob, this guy wants 10 grand from our corporate account to build a nuclear device  that fits in a suitcase.  Yeah, and it emits a lot of x-rays.  But it's okay, because the suitcase is aluminum.  Aluminum.  Aluminum.  And it will not be used for evil.  We don't know that, though.  Completely not for evil.  Yeah, but the jury's out on that.  You never know.  Yeah, it could be.  Also, you're at Starbucks, you leave the fucking briefcase just sitting there, and then 
[01:24:30]  evil comes by and grabs it.  Yeah.  I kind of have the feeling that you guys both know, but aren't saying it, that it's  completely true what I'm saying.  Dude, you lost me when I said, hello, Greg.  You lost me at hello.  You really did.  I'm the dummy.  No, you're not a dummy.  I didn't follow any of this shit.  No, you're not a dummy.  It's very easy to understand.  I like to play one on the radio, so let's keep it at that.  It's very easy to understand. 
[01:25:00]  If you want to understand something, there's something you can't do.  There's nothing you can't do without desire and two hands.  Nothing, so.  I always said, if you put your mind to something, you can accomplish anything.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Now, don't con me, Greg.  Now, Greg, don't con me.  Are we up to four milliamps or five milliamps?  I'm just starting on the fifth milliamp now.  We got Steve C. on the line. 
[01:25:30]  It's been a while.  All right.  Producer Steve C.  You're talking to Greg in Jersey.  Steve C.  Yes, sir.  I was wanting to know, is there enough room on the side of the suitcase for a Foundry Music  watermark?  So, I've got $500 for the young ride.  Linger longer.  Thank you, Steve.  Akbar.  Didn't we already talk to an Akbar?  Yeah, I think we did.  Akbar.  No, no, no.  This is Akbar from Pakistan.  Yes, I need the vice to destroy the pizza party. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, my God.  Imagine the damage it could do to the pizza party.  The pizza party's not easy.  No, that's going down, sir.  That's got to go down.  And there's security there.  And you're not going to believe it, but the head lizard is on the line.  Head lizard?  Oh, my God.  Don Rumsfeld.  Live from Washington, D.C.  Yes, Donald.  Gentlemen, may I talk to you again?  Yes.  It sounds just like him.  At least try, dude.  We appreciate when you at least try.  At least try. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, the space lizard community would like to reach out to this individual and recruit  him.  Oh.  Would you like to be recruited into a government agency for clandestine operations around the  world with your nuclear suitcase?  No, I want to work alone as an individual.  Oh, okay.  You're a bummer, man.  Oh, I do.  Hey.  What's your sense of humor?  How about girls?  What do you think of girls?  Wait, what?  What do you think of girls there, Greg? 
[01:27:00]  I don't think of girls.  I like girls.  You like girls?  Have you ever been with one?  Yeah.  Yeah, five.  I'm 25 years old.  I've been with five girls.  I've been with five girls at 25.  Yeah.  No condoms.  I've only worn condoms.  And they come over your house, and what happens?  A week later, their breasts fall off.  And their hair falls out.  Their hair falls out.  Their teeth.  They're pulling their teeth and fingernails out.  I know I'm going to say it again, but I just love the term.  You're doing all these willy-nilly experiments in your horrible, dirty apartment.  By the time he comes, he's been fucking brundle-fly. 
[01:27:30]  Don't really know what you're doing, and they're fucking leaving with half their hair.  Clumps of hair are falling out of their head.  And mommy's yelling from the kitchen above.  That's great.  What are you doing down there?  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  I knew this would be the hardest part.  It's not a joke.  I don't have $10,000.  Their ovaries look like potatoes.  Jesus.  With the fucking-  Yeah, they're just huge with big things growing off of them.  Well, that's when you leave the potatoes in the cupboard a little too long. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They start growing things.  It's kind of creepy.  Yeah, you're a scary guy.  You are, Greg.  A little scary.  Are you being serious?  Really scary?  Well, a little scary.  Just a little.  I don't know if we have time to go to all the calls, but Michael in Boston, can you tape  it behind a toilet in the Bronx?  Ah.  Let me say hi to Phil in Minnesota.  Phil.  Phil?  Yes.  I want to be the ass man, and I vow to protect this device by inserting it in my ass. 
[01:28:30]  I think the bit's over.  Finally.  Yeah, I think it just blew up the bits.  I think bit over.  Bit over?  We're calling it.  That's nice.  Good one.  We're calling it.  Yeah, good ending, though.  It always happens when a caller just self-destructs.  I want to thank Greg from Jersey.  Actually, it's not Greg from Jersey.  This is somebody we paid to call our radio show to give us an hour of great radio.  See, that's how it works.  That's right.  You pay an agency, and they plan out kind of what you want to do, and they have different  scenarios, and then a caller calls, and you pay that caller to give you banter back and 
[01:29:00]  forth.  Yeah, this was all made up, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Who would make up a lame-ass call like this?  Well, that agency, it is true, by the way.  Oh, I know, yeah.  We've never used that fucking agency.  I dare anyone to prove that we ever did.  And yeah, there's some lame-ass fucking radio shows out there that do pay an agency to set  up fucking crazy phone calls for the shows.  Yeah.  That is true.  That is happening.  Dude, that's how you could raise your fucking $10,000. 
[01:29:30]  Just call radio stations with this lame-ass story.  Morning, Zeus.  They'll love it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.  Finally, Charlie Sheen.  Oh, damn.  Charlie, a weird time to call, bud.  What's up, sir?  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good morning, losers.  Is this device armed for the trolls?  Winning, loser.  See, the quick call is the best.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Winning, loser.  Just, is it harmful to trolls? 
[01:30:00]  Do you, all right, on an honest level.  Do we know what Dr. Claw?  Dr. Claw?  Holy shit.  Oh, it is Inspector Gat?  Dr. Claw.  I knew, I knew.  Oh, sweet.  Oh, yeah.  I knew the geeks in the room would, one of them would laugh.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I didn't know Dr. Claw, Daddy.  Dr. Claw.  Yes, I would like to sponsor this device in order to use it to get my remedy on gadget.  That doesn't sound like Dr. Claw.  No, but.  Hey, I think I got an idea to get your money, sir. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Dr. Bill Deal.  Down there at Northwest Federal, I think.  Dr. Bill Deal.  We're not a bank, Greg.  All right, well, thank you.  Wait, we got another Claw on the line.  Maybe this guy's better.  We'll make Danny happier.  Dr. Claw.  Ten grand.  We look, the numbers are pretty sweet.  A nuclear reactor, ten grand. 
[01:31:00]  Now, Greg, all you need to know is your finder's fee.  What do you want?  Your fee.  Dr. Claw from Cleveland.  Yeah.  Yes, I would like to fund this project.  Oh, there you go.  That's much better.  Yeah, this is good.  I don't know.  I'll get you next time, Gadget.  Next time.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  It's my deal here, see.  Yeah, it's not a good idea to call it the Gadget, because that was the name of the first  atomic bomb.  The Gadget, exactly. 
[01:31:30]  It was called the Gadget, huh?  They called it the Gadget.  I want to hear from Dr. Claw a little more, but maybe that's all he had prepared today.  Is that it, Dr. Claw from Cleveland?  Um, no.  If you would get me in contact with this person, then we could discuss my plans in more detail.  I would not want to indulge the listeners and have them steal my plans.  Nothing evil here.  It's not any more complicated than that.  Thank you, Dr. Claw. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, I will.  Tommy, let Tommy do it.  I don't even know if we could go with this one, but we'll try.  Tom, go ahead.  Tom.  Stay there, Tom.  No, you're gone.  All right.  Well, that's, uh, wow.  So, Anthony, you really don't think I'm capable of doing this?  Tell me honestly.  Do you think or I'm not capable of doing this?  In a suitcase, no.  I don't think you're capable of doing this.  Well, I think these are like the guy said, uh, glorified, uh, light, light bulb or high 
[01:32:30]  energy, anode, cathode under, uh, water.  Uh, and I don't see any big whoop-dee-day.  It's like a fucking kid's science project for $10,000.  Why don't you just make a volcano and use baking soda and water and some dye?  No, it's not.  Baking soda and vinegar.  Sorry.  No, it's not a sign for it at all.  You'd have to prove that you actually have produced the neutrons.  Why don't you just get a cup and put dirt in it?  And call it cup of dirt? 
[01:33:00]  No.  You have to prove that you produce neutrons.  And the way you do that is either qualitatively, using a neutron bubble detector, or quantitatively.  Yeah, I got one of those at home, a neutron bubble detector, yeah.  I hear, uh, it's going to be over there at the pizza party, at Roland's Pizza Party,  a neutron bubble detector machine.  And, uh, as they're spinning the tunes, everybody's going to be able to see each other's bones  right through them, just with the naked eye.  Are we in the pre-show for the pizza party?  This is pre-show.  Like the Oscars? 
[01:33:30]  Pizza party pre-show.  I hope Sam has audio from the pre-show.  Pizza party.  Roland's Pizza Party going down today, too, if you're just tuning in.  Uh.  All right, well.  It's going to be a reaction in Roland's stomach.  Oh, yeah.  When he's eating that pizza.  Oh, yeah.  Lactose intolerant.  Greg, I guess I got to say no to your, uh, funding your project.  I'm sorry, sir.  Greg, I'm sorry.  We're going to have to say no, dog.  Your pitch was a little pitchy.  Boom.  And, uh, well, good luck to you.  How do people get a hold of you?  Maybe there's somebody out there for you. 
[01:34:00]  All right, my email address.  Is that good?  Well.  Well.  Have fun with that.  All right, how about Twitter?  Um.  B-I-O.  H-Z-D-7-9.  Okay.  All right.  Well, okay.  Can you show any gamma ray emissions with this thing?  No, no gamma rays.  Okay, then it's horseshit.  Oh, really?  All right, guys.  Yeah.  How about this?  When I do get it built, and I'm not going to stop here because I'm going to do it.  When it does happen, how about I show you guys? 
[01:34:30]  I don't feel like getting cancer in 10 years.  10.  You're getting 10 minutes with this fucking guy.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  He has a cancer machine.  He's building a cancer machine.  Is that what he's building?  It's like you just walk around with it, and people just instantly get cancer.  Because if he doesn't have the aluminum siding quite right, we're going to get some of those  Oh, please.  Yeah, but if you think about it, they use stuff that causes cancer to kill cancer and radiation.  So everyone that has cancer will be cured, and everyone that doesn't will get it.  Wait, so when you get cured from the cancer with the stuff that causes cancer, that will 
[01:35:00]  give you more cancer later on?  Yeah, in different parts of the cell.  It's not localized, right?  Fuck.  Well, there you go.  We're all just doomed.  Good luck, bro.  All right.  All right.  You're a regular Madame Curie.  He's like Madame Curie with the fucking...  He's going to drop dead from radiation.  Yeah, be careful.  I'll be careful.  Be careful.  Be careful.  Be careful.  All right, guys.  I'm going to bring it in when it's done.  I'm not joking.  All right.  All right, sir. 
[01:35:30]  Bring it in.  That sounds like...  That was a threat.  I'm going to bring it in when it's done.  I'm not joking.  I'm not joking.  You know what, Greg?  I want to go on record and say I believe in you, sir.  I just can't fund you right now.  Money's a little tight.  You really don't.  Yeah, you know, in this economy.  Too many people in my family losing jobs.  I'm lifting too many people up right now, sir.  Yeah.  Sorry, I'm funding a cruise missile right now for my neighbor.  And I still got to send a donation to some kid at Harborfields High School who's cutting  his hair off for cancer kids. 
[01:36:00]  I didn't forget.  I haven't officially made the donation that I tweeted about.  I haven't forgot.  Why does he have to cut it off?  Just get this guy's machine here and it'll fall out.  That's true.  All right, guys.  Don't forget me and I'll bring anyone in.  All right.  We're not going to forget you anytime soon.  Captain Half-Life.  All right.  And by the way, they traced a call an hour ago.  Just to be safe.  Just keep everyone safe.  The call's coming from in the building.  The call's coming from the pizza party.  All right, guys.  All right.  We went from Roland's pizza party to this guy. 
[01:36:30]  To a little science debate.  This wasn't on our sheet today.  Where was this on our sheet?  I'm going to debate you, Greg.  Yeah, we should talk about the fake fucking phone calls that these asshole shows have been  using for a while.  I'm glad it's finally out there because you don't want to be the guy that rats that shit  out.  No.  Although we've sort of have talked about it the last couple of years.  But yeah, it's a big fucking deal, man.  It's a big deal.  People that can't just fucking go with something like we just did.  They need somebody to call the show. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  And get people a-buzzin' about what they heard on their favorite radio show.  Amazing.  And there's all contracting.  Supposedly Rush Limbaugh uses those people.  Really?  He's the big one, yeah.  I know Mancow used to use them when he was-  Turd!  When he was a shock jock.  Ah, turd!  He did all that shit.  Yeah.  He was very guilty of that.  Was turd real?  Who knows?  Oh, boy.  Who the fuck knows if turd was real?  Well, he crashed that car into the building.  Who the fuck knows, man?  Wow.  Everyone's saying I'm missing an opportunity. 
[01:37:30]  Of what?  Oh, to invest in something ridiculous?  Yeah, I know.  I want to start investing.  Yeah.  Put it this way.  I'd dump more money into Citadel before I give it to this guy.  Oh, boy.  You got to bring that up.  Yeah.  We were all getting along.  That was our meltdown.  That was our China syndrome.  There's only one thing to play going into break here.  What is that?  Yeah, come on.  Brian Regan talking about science.  Science.  Hopefully we'll get an update on Roland's Pizza Party, where we're at with that. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  The pre-show has begun.  Oh, yeah.  For Roland's Pizza Party happening at noon here.  It's like the red carpet.  If you didn't get the email, then you're not invited.  Mm-hmm.  And the Mike Starr voicemail.  And then the gift that Sam just handed to us today.  A few minutes from Kathie Lee and Hoda.  Yeah.  Worst show on TV by far.  What is Hoda?  Is that her name?  I guess.  Is it first or last name?  I don't know.  It's a Hoda.  Or is she doing like a Cher thing?  She looks like a Hoda.  One word, Hoda. 
[01:38:30]  She looks like a Hoda.  What an awful, unsexy name to be called.  Yes.  Hey, Hoda.  Could you imagine?  Like, oh.  Oh, Hoda.  That feels so good.  Oh, Hoda.  Fuck, yeah.  Lick my balls, Hoda.  I'm going to fuck you, Hoda.  Ugh.  That's horrible.  It's not a sexy name.  Just thanks.  Scott Wheeler's getting mad.  Rush does not use those guys.  He doesn't do those stupid bits.  Rush has done plenty of stupid bits over the years.  Yeah.  Relax.  Heard him. 
[01:39:00]  Relax.  You could still be a fan.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Every radio guy has done stupid bits.  Yeah.  Except us.  Except for us.  We still hold strong to the fact that the bra bombing show was...  Was real.  You know what?  When we go into the fucking Radio Hall of Fame, I think that might be the bit we give  them.  That's the one that's going to put us over?  That they listen to for eternity.  Yee-hoo.  All right.  We're babbling.  Brian Reagan, everyone.  I think the worst day was the day the Science Project was due. 
[01:39:30]  Waking up that morning.  That was fun, huh?  Your head would pop off your pillow.  Oh, no.  That's due today.  I had nine months to work on and I did nothing.  I have a cardboard box.  Of boxing.  And you'd show up.  You're scared because you don't have anything good.  And you find out all the other kids, their parents made theirs for them. 
[01:40:00]  I hated that, you know?  They're backing them in on flatbed trucks.  One kid with a volcano.  He didn't have to zip up his own pants, but he built a volcano.  You had to swing that.  I don't know what to do for my project.  So I brought in a paper cup filled with dirt.  Just hoping she'd know I'm an idiot and just walk right on past me.  As long as I was holding something.  What do you have there, Brian?  It's a cup of dirt. 
[01:40:30]  Just put an F on there and let me go home.  Well, explain it.  Well, it's a cup with dirt in it.  I call it cup of dirt.  You should move on now.  You should go ahead and move on.  Head on down the line there.  So she went to this one kid.  There was a kid in my class.  He made the same solar system like 19 years in a row, you know?  Bunch of styrofoam balls held together with coat hangers. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, you're breaking some new ground there, Copernicus.  He's going, the big yellow one's the sun.  The yellow one is the sun.  Okay, all right, what are these other planets?  The big yellow one is the sun.  All right, calm down.  All right!  Hey, this is Victoria Gotti.  Hey, this is Don Cade.  Because I talk to guys that found the black boxes,  and yet our government says they weren't discovered. 
[01:41:30]  Why?  This is Jesse Ventura.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  And you're listening to Oppie and Anthony.  Oppie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  You're listening to Oppie and Anthony. 
[01:42:00]  We're having a fine show today.  I don't know what it is or what it means, but I know it's fine.  Roland's Pizza Party.  We don't have much to report because a lot of people aren't here yet.  No, he's just wandering around.  I think they're sleeping in because, you know,  they're getting ready for the big shingle.  Yeah, you've got to nap so you're not tired during the big pizza party. 
[01:42:30]  I know last break started with us talking about Unplugged.  I didn't forget.  Alice in Chains, Nirvana, trying to figure out the best Unplugged ever.  STP.  STP makes the short list.  And then a few people wanted to throw Pearl Jam in there.  I don't think I ever saw the Pearl Jam Unplugged.  And this one's going to drive you nuts, but a lot of people said Oasis.  And I know you're not a fan of Oasis.  We lost Mike Starr. 
[01:43:00]  No surprise, really.  He was on Celebrity Rehab, and he was out of his fucking mind.  And then he looked like he was doing very well.  To the point Dr. Drew brought him back as a success story.  That's great.  And now he's dead from what looks like drugs.  Dr. Drew is...  Is he in hiding?  I don't know. 
[01:43:30]  He should just fucking not make it seem like he's curing these people.  Well, the other problem...  I have a lot of problems with Dr. Drew.  And it's not...  And I know he's helped a lot of people in Hollywood, because we know.  We're in the know as far as that shit goes because of some things.  And when he's really helping people, they do well.  But when he's filming a TV show, the rehab's only, I think, a long weekend.  Maybe a week.  Maybe a little longer than a week. 
[01:44:00]  I don't know.  But it's not a true rehab.  You're not curing people.  And then he's graduating them with diplomas and stuff after a long weekend, a long holiday weekend.  And then sending them out to the world.  Yeah.  And then some of these people then will go into sober living for another really long weekend.  Like, he doesn't have time to go to the celebrity's look.  If we're going to do this properly, it's got to be at least 30 days, possibly 60.  Some of you people need 60.  I know he doesn't make 28 days. 
[01:44:30]  No.  I know that.  He's just...  He's just pumping out TV shows.  Giving him a little Band-Aid for a little while.  Correct.  And this is a perfect example.  He shouldn't have graduation ceremonies, ever.  No.  So Mike Starr is gone.  He was the original bassist for Alice in Chains.  Yeah.  And Alice in Chains is still doing it.  A lot of people still like Alice in Chains.  But the new guy?  I'm still having a tough time.  Yeah, me too.  That Lane Staley voice was...  Yeah, it was great.  When he harmonized with Cantrell. 
[01:45:00]  I know.  Fantastic.  But Cantrell could still fucking harmonize with the best of them.  Yeah.  But, I don't know.  It's not the same to me.  And I know a lot of people digging it out there.  So Mike Starr, they find him in a house in Utah.  And we got a voicemail.  Was he in his own vomit?  I don't know.  Do we have the latest on that?  Everybody that ODs is found in their own vomit.  Sometimes feces and urine, too.  Well, because then you're...  Flood.  Your bowels just empty.  Your bowels, they empty. 
[01:45:30]  It's an effect from the drugs.  Jimmy will be at...  Yeah.  Cobbs in San Francisco, right?  Yeah.  I think he just tweeted that he's on a plane.  I'm on a plane.  Ma, ma, ma, ma.  What did he say?  He gave us a shout-out on his Twitter today.  Oh, hi, Jimmy.  But I know why.  Because he wanted to promote his CD.  So he kind of...  Yeah, he kind of...  Boarding plane to SF in a minute. 
[01:46:00]  I miss Opie Radio and Anthony Cumia already.  Oh!  They're the finest people I know.  Wow!  And then his hashtag is groveling for CD plug.  Okay.  So make sure you get Despicable, Jimmy's new CD.  He'll be back soon, I guess.  Yeah.  He's going to be on the road a little bit.  He's leaving us more and more lately.  I know.  He's a busy man.  A big star.  A big star.  That's right.  Who's on the hotline?  Kaku, but... 
[01:46:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He missed his opportunity.  Unless there's something else we could ask him today.  Oh, boy.  Was there something else we needed to ask him?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  This is...  Oh, but...  You could ask him about the pizza party.  Oh, that's silly.  Yeah, tell him...  Tell him we just finished the segment and we apologize for waking up.  Tell him we're moving on from nuclear fusion.  That's a...  That's...  Yeah.  We're talking about...  Or do you want to get...  Fission now.  We're going the other way.  Oh, we are. 
[01:47:00]  We're going fission.  You want him or what?  For what, though?  I don't know.  You want to ask him about that thing?  What thing?  Kind of went a while with that fucking nuclear thing.  We did go a little long.  What it is is...  I know.  Oh, you could hear us?  Oh, God.  Dr. Kaku.  Hi, Dr. Kaku.  You could hear us?  Yeah, hi.  Oh, hello.  Oh, hi.  Well, he knows Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, this is a little awkward because...  We kind of moved on from nuclear fusion, and now we're getting back to telling dick jokes. 
[01:47:30]  But we were talking about...  A listener called up and said that he has constructed a device which uses...  What the hell is that water?  It's heavy water.  The heavy water.  It's heavy water, and he starts the reaction with...  Deuterium or something like that.  No?  Deuterium?  Yeah.  You know...  Deuterium.  Deuterium. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  What about deuterium?  And this guy uses deuterium and an electric current to make a reaction that is self-sustaining,  he says.  Well, I doubt it's nuclear fusion.  Tritium is the chemical that's missing here.  You want deuterium and tritium.  And tritium is highly radioactive, extremely rare.  And I doubt that he has anything more than maybe a simple chemical reaction. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  It's some...  Reaction.  Yeah?  It's some kind of electrical reaction.  He's got an anode and a cathode, and he's making some type of plasma reaction in this heavy water.  But he says it is indeed self-sustaining.  Yeah, I tend to doubt that.  Yeah, yeah.  Because nuclear reactions are extremely hard to generate.  You know, you basically generate them in stars and in hydrogen bombs. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  And doing it in somebody's basement is highly unlikely.  Yeah, well, he was also saying it wasn't nuclear, which to me is a little odd.  I don't know what type of reaction he was talking about.  He didn't have palladium or any other chemical involved, right?  Just deuterium?  Yes, just deuterium and an anode, a cathode, a little cage around one of his devices. 
[01:49:30]  Was it the anode or the cathode?  I think it's the cathode.  And he had a battery from Radio Shack.  I don't know what he had.  But he's saying he was able to make a self-sustaining power device in his basement and wants to make it smaller and in the size of a suitcase.  Well, I really doubt it.  I mean, even people who believe in cold fusion require palladium in order to get a reaction going.  And even then, some people dispute whether or not that works. 
[01:50:00]  So, getting deuterium or heavy water to suddenly undergo some kind of nuclear reaction with a car battery, I think, is out of the question.  Yeah, that's what we were thinking.  We just wanted to confirm it with you.  Ask about EVIL.  Yeah.  Could something like that be used for EVIL?  Well, who knows in the future?  People have tried to do cold fusion experiments for many, many decades and have failed.  So, you know, Mother Nature does it, but Mother Nature takes a star to do it. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  Exactly.  Like you, you're a star these days.  I see you all over the place.  Oh, thank you.  It's great.  What are we looking forward to as far as what Dr. Michio Kaku is doing on TV?  Well, first of all, I'm coming out with a new book next week.  Yeah, it's called...  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  You didn't.  We are never getting it back.  Who cares?  I was really...  That one...  You know something?  I've seen it done a thousand times. 
[01:51:00]  Who cares?  And I really...  It shocks me sometimes, and that one got me.  Who cares?  Who cares?  I'm sure there's one person out there, at least, that is laughing his ass off.  It starts with doctor and ends with Steve.  We did enough radio for the eggheads.  We got to get back to doing dummy radio.  Well, dummy radio.  Who's going to clean up my mess? 
[01:51:30]  I love that someone has to clean up my mess.  Just say, the phone's screwed up.  We apologize.  Get the name of...  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  I don't know.  The phone's...  The phone's a screw...  Can you hear me?  Yeah, you were talking about your book.  Yeah, where are you calling from?  Because your phone crapped out.  Sorry about that.  I'm calling from MIT.  I'm in Boston right now.  Well, you would think they would have good cell service.  Are you looked at at MIT like a hero, or are you looked at like somebody that's sold out?  You're not evil over there, are you? 
[01:52:00]  No, I'm here for a meeting of the Science Channel here at MIT.  Oh, you're on the Science Channel?  Yeah.  My favorite show.  I watch the Science Channel.  I love the Science Channel.  An idiot abroad.  Yeah, and also, let me...  Isn't that on the Science Channel?  Yes, it is.  Right, it is.  See, there's something for everyone on the Science Channel.  Yes, smart and idiot.  You don't need to be an egghead.  Right.  Anyway, my new book comes out next week.  It's called...  No, no, no, no. 
[01:52:30]  No, no, no.  Look, call them.  Just call them and say, we're having a problem with our phones.  We apologize.  Just get the name of the book and tell them we'll plug it later and stuff.  The name of his book.  Please, put a patch on this fucking tire.  But he's calling back.  What the hell's wrong with the phones today?  I'm really embarrassed, man. 
[01:53:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm really embarrassed.  We got a brilliant mind on the phone.  It looks like we're having a problem with our phones today, sir.  They're saying something about solar flares or something are happening today.  Is that true?  Well, last month we had a gigantic solar flare that almost hit the Earth.  Right.  Yeah, I read about that one.  Those things can do some damage to our electrical system, huh?  Yeah.  Satellites?  Up to $1 trillion damage in a worst-case scenario.  Wow, that's crazy. 
[01:53:30]  Wow.  Anyway, I keep getting interrupted.  Yeah, I know.  Your book.  I want to hear about your book.  Anyway, it's about the next one, huh?  I can't.  I can't take this.  I'm going to have to leave.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  It's Dr. Michio Kaku.  This guy's a legendary physicist.  Who the hell is he?  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, God.  Can Mars fix the...  Oh, you got Mars?  You got Mars to fix...  Yeah, he fixed it.  It was a...  Yeah, it was what...  Actually, it was something stupid and mechanical.  Something laying on one of the buttons.  Oh, God.  Dr. Kaku.  Dr. Kaku, I apologize again.  That was a mechanical problem.  The book.  Let's hear about the book.  Yeah.  Anyway, it's about the next 100 years. 
[01:54:30]  Uh-huh.  And I've interviewed 300 of the world's top scientists.  Right.  To get the best picture of what 2100 will look like.  Oh, and what are some of the...  What are some of the things we might be seeing in the next 100 years?  Well, for example, the Internet will be in your contact lens probably within the next 10 to 20 years.  Well, if you don't wear contacts.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm kidding, of course.  You blink and you go online.  Really?  And your contact lens will recognize people's faces.  You'll always know who you're talking to and translate what they're saying as they speak in a foreign language. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, we need that for Roland.  Yeah.  Because that's a foreign language.  This guy over here having a pizza party today.  And what other big things can we look forward to in the next 100 years?  Because a lot of people make these calls.  And quite frankly, very rarely do they hit it right.  Yeah.  Well, I've interviewed the scientists who are actually inventing the future.  Oh.  I've seen prototypes of all these things.  For example, we'll communicate with computers via the mind. 
[01:55:30]  We'll mentally be able to move objects around us, mentally communicate with computers.  Oh.  And basically, we'll have the power of the gods of mythology.  Yes.  Yes.  The gods of mythology, you recall, could snap their fingers, create objects, move things.  They had ageless bodies, perfect bodies.  And they had chariots that could take them to the sky.  So we'll have a life somewhat similar to the gods of mythology. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  I hear you.  Well, that's fantastic.  And when is that book coming out?  Next week, Physics of the Future.  Physics of the Future.  We're talking to Newsweek magazine about excerpting it.  Oh, great.  The new Newsweek.  That's very good.  That's right.  Wonderful.  Dr. Michio Kaku, thank you so much.  Okay.  All right.  And you take care.  Yeah, I know.  Sorry about that.  It happens.  It happens.  What about TV?  What about TV?  Any shows coming up? 
[01:56:30]  Uh, well.  I can't.  End of story.  So to speak.  Okay.  So to speak, literally.  I, nigh.  Oh, no.  I know.  I did.  I had to set him up on that. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, you did.  I feel bad, but it's the only way it really could have ended.  You're a little more guilty than people realize.  Yeah.  I'm a bad cop that has to sometimes play good cop.  Yeah.  All right.  That's fantastic.  And then you get a few babies out there.  Oh, clam up.  Look at the babies.  Is that what they do?  That's what I see when they write.  All annoyed. 
[01:57:30]  What are you doing?  You guys.  Dr. Kaku is going to hit us with a particle ray or something.  He probably will.  Let's get this Mike Starr thing done.  Yes.  It's been teased about.  So Mike Starr.  The Mike Starr is in the galaxies.  No.  No, he's done.  Yeah.  This star is down in a hole.  Goodbye. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, I got it.  See what I did there, huh?  Yes.  Mike Starr leaves a voicemail for his drug dealer the night before his death.  This is always creepy shit.  Hey, what's up?  It's Mike Starr.  I'm from Gene.  Hey, give me a call right away.  I got something really important to tell you.  You'll be really excited.  Yeah, give me a call right away.  I'll be waiting for you to call.  You're going to make some good money on this.  Also, I want to see if you can show me an ace, square ounce, half ounce, bud, whatever. 
[01:58:30]  A killer pipe.  Are you on a cellular phone?  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  All right.  Call me.  Later.  Jesus.  Wow.  What's he doing?  Jesus.  Wow.  What the fuck?  You don't do that.  Like, wow.  We got one of them on the line.  He's brave enough to call.  Yes, Andrew.  You're a dickhead, Opie. 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What do you think of the Mike Starr?  Sounds kind of fucked up.  Yeah, he sounds fucked up.  And then he's not even talking in code to his drug dealer.  Well, what did he ask for? 
[01:59:30]  Some bud.  And then something else.  Oh, he said bud?  I think he said bud.  Didn't he say bud?  You heard bud in there?  Yeah, some bud.  Yeah, what was the other stuff?  I don't know.  There was definitely some other stuff, too.  He was slurring so much, it was difficult.  It sounded like it was more in code.  Let me go to the end of the call and see if we can pick up on...  I think he needs to back up a little more.  I feel bad.  A little more than that, even?  Oh, well, yeah.  I feel bad.  This guy was definitely...  I did watch that celebrity rehab. 
[02:00:00]  This guy was fucking tortured, man.  But, yeah.  This guy was fucking tortured.  Where the fuck am I?  Where the fuck am I?  Let me see something.  Hold on a minute there.  Do you want to hear the whole thing again?  What the hell?  This was just a mere few hours before he died.  Hey, what's up?  It's Mike Starr.  I'm from James.  Hey, give me a call right away.  I got something really important to tell you.  You'll be really excited.  Yeah, give me a call right away. 
[02:00:30]  I'll be waiting for you to call.  You're going to make some good money on this.  And also, I want to see if you can show me an eighth, quarter ounce, half ounce of bud, whatever.  You're going to kill a pipe.  Just go up this way.  I ain't so bad.  All right.  Call me.  Later.  I don't know.  He wanted an eighth or something.  Yeah, I know.  And then a half ounce of bud.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, the bud was the easy stuff.  There was some other shit in there.  That sucks.  That addiction's got to just suck for people.  How the fuck do you get over it?  I see these guys.  They come in here on a daily basis, and they're just shaking in their boots constantly.  Yeah.  I ain't going to name names.  You know, they're struggling to this day.  Oh, totally.  It's fucking got to suck.  That has to be fucking bad, man.  Fuck that.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  I think we should break.  Yeah, I want to get to the Kathy Lee program.  That sounds great.  No, we can do it.  Let's go on a break, because thank God we don't have to talk about him a lot today.  Charlie Sheen.  He apologized to John Cryer.  Yeah.  He backed that shit up a little bit.  He endorses Rob Lowe to take his place, because if the show does well, he still gets paid,  I guess.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know.  Maybe in syndication or something.  I don't know.  Oh, probably, yeah.  He's gotten over 74,000 internship applications, and I think there was an article in the paper today 
[02:02:00]  that he's kind of admitting, finally, that he's losing his mind.  Yeah, yeah.  He said something like, yeah, he's losing his mind.  I think he said he's going to back off the public displays that he's been doing and stuff.  But who the fuck knows?  What does he need an intern for?  It was just part of a...  What a bit.  Well, a publicity thing.  He's just trying to see how many applications he could get.  Well, no.  Internships.com or something like that paid him to... 
[02:02:30]  Okay, so they were just trying to drive traffic to the site.  Great.  I got you.  Okay.  Is he going to kick this person in the balls?  Okay, hey.  Hey, that's...  What happened?  See, management says not to talk about that.  See, they haven't talked to me about it yet, so I'm safe until they talk to me about it.  That's why I didn't bring it up.  They got you.  They got you.  Believe me, the second I heard intern, I wanted to say, at least Charlie Jean can have an intern.  But he got you.  I'm still...  Yeah.  I'm still rocking through this maze that's between here and that elevator. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, it's like Pac-Man.  And they haven't found me yet.  It's like Pac-Man.  So I'm sure I'll have my talking to as well.  Woo, woo, woo, woo.  But they got you already.  You're done.  You got Inky Bladder, Dinky Cross, Who Are The Ghosts?  Oh.  And Binky.  And Sue.  Is there a...  Yeah, Sue with the pink bow, right?  In the yellow dot.  Yeah.  And then you just got to run through the hallways, because there are a few different ways you 
[02:03:30]  can go to try to avoid them.  I need a third way.  What would be like a power pellet?  Power pellet?  Oh.  There's no power pellets around here.  That's a distraction you could throw in the way.  There's no power pellets.  Yeah, that's a distraction down the hall.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Throw in the way.  Do you know the one really good way out of here?  A window?  No.  There's...  Just launch yourself.  I love when we go left, and they quickly run down the hall and go left over there to  catch us.  Oh, you ever see them pop out of the door by the elevator?  Oh, yeah.  And it's like, surprise, like, fuck. 
[02:04:00]  I'm going to show you another way.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  But you got to go to the elevators.  That's the week...  You don't.  What?  Well, you go to an elevator eventually, after a few more maneuvers.  Are you talking a few stairs, maybe?  That's okay if they know, because now they don't know which way we're going.  It's another option.  This company takes up a few floors.  You got to get out of the...  Oh, so you could go up to get down.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, boy. 
[02:04:30]  I got a new way for you, brother.  Up for down.  That could work.  Yep.  It's like the Poseidon Adventure.  Yep.  Sometimes you go down with a limo.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah, that elevator.  Yep.  Got to know all the tricks.  Repelling down the side of the building.  I'd rather do that than talk to them.  That will happen eventually.  All right.  A few minutes from Kathy Lee and Hoda, and maybe a pizza party update from somebody, because 
[02:05:00]  the halls are abuzz.  Oh, yeah.  You want to do some more?  Hoda.  Yeah.  Grab my balls, Hoda.  We're showing TV.  We're going to give you a few minutes.  Hoda.  After this break.  The virus, Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now we're talking. 
[02:05:30]  Ew.  Sing along time.  Hate this.  Absolutely.  You're going to totally do?  How many special people change?  How many lives are living strange?  Where were you while we were getting high?  So we're walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball.  Where were you while we were getting high?  Someday you will find me coming in the landslide in a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova in the sky. 
[02:06:00]  Toot-de-dee-doo. 
[02:06:30]  Toot-dee-doo.  Ah, the slide whistle.  You should go to an Oasis show.  Brings out the bruds.  Does it?  Brings out the bruds.  Yeah, well.  I don't think I need to go to an Oasis show.  I don't think you can anymore.  You can't anymore.  Ah, good.  The brothers finally had it with each other.  Over all the years, haven't they?  All right. 
[02:07:00]  Fucking, I love Twitter.  Hanging up on legendary physicist Michu Kaku four times equals radio gold.  And then he just writes, dumb scientist.  Dumb scientist.  Michael J. Lauer.  That's brilliant.  Dumb scientist.  What are we doing?  Oh, do we have a pizza party update?  Roland's Pizza Party goes down to three hours.  Wow.  Just over three hours, Anthony. 
[02:07:30]  Only three hours away.  Things are getting really smoking, but the guest list is becoming a huge problem.  Why?  Because he's doing it in our office.  He's from one of our two offices.  Yeah, I mean, because people keep...  He didn't book a big enough venue?  Are they allowed to have the pizza party in the hallway?  No, hell no.  No way.  It can't spill out into the hallway?  No, no.  That's a big no-no.  You can't have people lingering in the hallway.  Oh, boy.  You can't.  It's like a...  That's where ideas are exchanged.  No, people...  When there's people lingering outside an office...  Not in an office with a cold fucking long table.  Oh, God. 
[02:08:00]  I hate that.  You can't be in the hallway.  So we're going to have to confine everyone to the office, but people keep coming up and saying...  Door shut?  Well, I'm going to recommend it.  That the door is shut, right?  For impact.  Plus, there'll be Troy DJing, so I'm assuming they'll want the door shut.  The music, yeah.  And there's no bubble machine, right?  That was just for the radio?  It's not for the radio.  None of this is for the radio.  This is the problem.  None of this is for the radio.  This is all just real shit.  And he didn't have a bubble machine.  He bought it this week.  What the fuck is going on? 
[02:08:30]  Before the party.  All right, all right.  Give me the guest list.  Who's going?  Well, before, it was the main ONA staff.  So just, you know, just the guys here.  Then it was three people from the talent department.  One person from sales.  Yeah.  And Rob Cross.  And that was the guest list.  Rob Cross made the cut?  Well, Ron wants to make sure, you know.  I don't have as many issues with Rob Cross. 
[02:09:00]  I'm going to go on record and say that.  As many as what?  As others.  Oh.  That's not nice.  I don't mind him as much.  I want Rob to know that.  But then as people started to get, I mean, I guess he's happy.  It's going to cause problems.  Yeah.  Of course it will.  Oh, of course it will.  Why would that cause problems?  I don't know, but it will.  They told me to be more positive.  That's positive.  Well, no, because you didn't.  That's positive right there.  It would have been positive for you to say, I don't have a lot of problems with Rob Cross. 
[02:09:30]  Instead, you said, I don't have a lot of problems with Rob Cross as opposed to the other people who I do have problems with.  You weren't so much complimenting Rob Cross as you were bashing the other guys.  They said, my attitude's getting in the way of things and I need to be more positive.  That's positivity right there.  See, you took one positive step forward and two negative steps back.  So in the end, it's still a negative.  You're one negative.  I'm one negative?  Yeah.  The positive canceled out.  The one negative, but then you still have one negative. 
[02:10:00]  And another one.  Yeah.  And I did say, as many issues as.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As many.  Which implies that there are still issues.  Still some issues.  Just not as many as the other two.  Right.  Yeah.  See?  You didn't say you like the guy.  This positivity thing is really weird.  It's not hard.  It's really weird.  It's not that hard.  It's kind of hard.  Like, for instance, I could say, I'm glad Roland invited Rob because I like the guy.  Like, that's a positive statement to me.  I just don't have as many issues with him.  As what?  As others. 
[02:10:30]  See, you just did it again.  You did it.  Why can't you just say you like him?  I'm being.  I thought this did it again.  In my mind, I thought this is a really positive thing to say.  No.  No.  No, it's not.  But then people, the more people find out about it, the more people are actually asking.  Well, it's the thing to do, right?  It's the thing to do today.  And then Roland wants to make political moves, so this person's assistant said, hey, what  about me?  I'll bring this person's assistant.  So then the two assistants come and... 
[02:11:00]  Well, look.  And one guy will say, hey, I'll bring like three girls with me.  Right now, it was only two girls at the party, so that guy gets to come.  But here's the thing.  I understand E-Rock will be there.  Yeah.  And Roland, of course, throwing it.  But there are 80 slices of pizza.  Correct.  It's 10 pots.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, 80.  So the math is correct there.  Yeah.  So how many people?  It's going to take...  I've heard that he has reserved chairs already in the office. 
[02:11:30]  That's true.  Wait, wait.  There's like a VIP area, like where you could sit down and get a bottle?  Well, one chair is reserved VIP.  God, why do I...  One chair is reserved VIP?  And then one chair is reserved for Kevin from Project Runway, who will be coming.  Wow.  And actually, I think Roland's trying to book him a little early so we can sneak him into  the after show.  He now works for Tommy Hilfinger.  Hilfinger. 
[02:12:00]  Hilfinger.  And then the sofa...  He does.  He's a big star.  Each seat of the sofa has a cushion, and I was very flattered, because one cushion says  that it's reserved for Sam.  He's putting signs all over the office where people are supposed to sit?  The other cushion says reserved for Liam from Talent.  Oh, okay.  Where is he now?  Probably in the office.  He cleaned the office yesterday to make sure they're...  That's like the VIP area.  Right.  Or the chairs.  In the words of Ant, there's going to be no evil people at this thing, right? 
[02:12:30]  Any evil?  Well, I mean, it would depend on who you consider evil.  Well, there's quite a few.  Rob Cross.  Well, he was invited.  Oh, wait a minute.  What happened?  First of all, that's very negative.  He still works for the other side.  That is true.  He's part of evil.  And I mean, it's hard to...  If somebody who you thought was evil came to the door and said, hey, can I come?  It'd be tough for Roland to say, no, you can't come.  I'm almost wishing I didn't have things to do at, like, noon.  Why don't you come back? 
[02:13:00]  Well, no, because I have things to do.  It's lasting all the way till one.  All I ask...  All the way till one.  It's a one-hour party that's been planned for close to a week now.  Now, someone's got to HD flip this shit.  Yeah.  I got to babysit my kid today, so I can't come back.  We can put it on Sex Bagel Cam.  He sucks at making videos.  Oh, but he's trying.  He's not very good at the video thing.  He's not very good at videos.  He gets distracted.  Is it all just food?  He gets distracted.  He writes me all the time, like, hey, man, could you retweet my latest video? 
[02:13:30]  And I have to go, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you?  No.  Why not?  Because they suck.  He's making videos?  Yeah, he is.  Here and there, yeah.  I haven't seen any.  Here, I'll show you a couple.  Oh, thanks.  No, we don't need to see his...  Oh, I just want to see a little bit.  A little bit.  Oh, it's probably E-Rock Radio.  Ah.  Yeah.  So he could be just like, oh, me.  How do you get that name, O-B?  It's Hero.  O-B, what's your YouTube name again?  Piece of shit.  O-B, E-Rock Radio.  Oh, this is Roland in the car. 
[02:14:00]  It's like, how about some light on Roland so you can see him in your video?  Oh, boy.  This is the one he wanted me to retweet.  Oh, okay.  Roland sings Jesse's Girl.  Oh, I can't believe it.  I wish I had Jesse's Girl.  I wish I had Jesse's Girl.  You want to find a woman like that. 
[02:14:30]  Jesse's Girl.  I want to have Jesse's Girl.  You want to find a woman like that.  E-Rock Video.  I wish you could see Ant's face right now.  Oh, my God.  He's tagging his videos now with Mario Brothers, but it's not Mario Brothers.  It's a fat E-Rock going up the flagpole. 
[02:15:00]  And then it says E-Rock Video.  Somebody made the, I can't remember who it was, but somebody in the office made the observation  that, like, you can't have title cards that are that intricate, like, when there's no  substance to the video.  Right.  You can't have these big, like, substantive title cards.  Yeah.  It even diminishes more.  Now, should I have retweeted that video?  And be honest, Ant.  I'll be completely honest, and I'm not even joking.  No.  Yeah, why would I retweet that?  There really wasn't.  You can't even see Roland. 
[02:15:30]  You can't see Roland.  No, it's a concept, good.  We'll critique his video.  Concept, good.  Roland singing, good.  Can't see Roland.  No.  At all.  No.  And the truth of the matter is.  And then he kind of blew it with the first verse of Jesse's Girl.  If that wasn't E-Rock.  If that wasn't E-Rock and Roland, right?  Mm-hmm.  You've got to think of it in these terms.  Mm-hmm.  Not E-Rock, not Roland.  And that was just on, and someone gave me the link.  Like, I would maybe click on it and be like, oh, what's it? 
[02:16:00]  Click off.  Click off.  I wouldn't even get to the fucking, the Mario Brothers ending.  Here's the one more.  Oh, okay.  No.  But he wants you to retweet this too.  Yeah.  All right.  This was around holiday time, so this would have been holiday greetings from Roland.  Nice fireplace, right?  Wait, wait, wait.  That was it?  I chose not to play the audio.  But then you got, well, I mean.  All right.  Does he say something?  Oh, yeah, he does. 
[02:16:30]  It's like the Yule log in a real fireplace.  On TV.  And first of all, what did he yell?  Gay?  He said the word gay.  He said gay.  The aspect ratio was all off.  It looked like it should have been widescreen, and it was squished to SD, and it was like.  This isn't cool.  Do you notice how his little tag at the end is almost half the length of that video?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at the aspect ratio on that. 
[02:17:00]  Wait a minute.  Yeah, go back.  It's horrible.  It's all fucking.  It's all squishy.  It's squished.  It's got to be stretched into widescreen.  Does he know how to do that?  We all know why E-Rock is making squishy videos now, don't we?  Oh, oh.  Like the heart video.  He wants to be thin like us.  Oh.  Oh.  So in his imaginary world, he squishes everything.  Yikes.  I think he's onto something with these videos.  Why?  I'm not sure what it is. 
[02:17:30]  I like the end thing, though.  The E-Rock video.  You do.  Is it always a Mario Brother thing?  Yeah, it's an E-Rock video.  We all need to tag our videos with something.  Well, I believe the prototypes for the next videos that have not been published yet, it's  like one of them will be the intro, one will be the outro, because there's two different  ones.  Oh.  No.  What's wrong with that?  He's going to bookend his videos with this crap?  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  E-Rock video. 
[02:18:00]  He sucks.  Well, you know, I...  It's called branding.  I really am a sucker for a grandiose opening.  I have been known to do a few myself.  But weren't you mocking the openings by doing your grandiose opening?  And don't you have substance after it?  Yeah, I try to.  Okay.  But it is a complete goof on the fact that people are starting to put fucking credits  and big...  Look, I don't mind if you're tagging...  Like, I got a corporate logo on the front of mine.  Right.  On the front of mine, like movie companies do. 
[02:18:30]  But it's a joke.  But he's branding it.  And it's fine if it's quick.  Like, Sam just pointed out his tag is longer than the actual video.  That was Travis that pointed that out.  Oh, Travis, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But the record's state.  Right.  Someone I don't mind.  Who, Travis?  You don't mind him?  Don't mind him.  That's positive.  As opposed to who?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You just...  You know what it is?  He just said he doesn't mind you.  Do you like it? 
[02:19:00]  That's just like...  I'll take that, though.  I'll take that.  Hey, that's a start.  It's like, he's there.  I'm being...  Six years in, I'll take that.  I'm being more positive.  Six years in.  This is positivity.  I can tell.  He doesn't, like, piss you off.  No.  No, no, no.  Justin in Oklahoma.  Justin?  I just wanted to point out, you said you could not attend the meeting today because you had  to babysit your kid.  It's not babysitting.  It's your whole kid.  I had a discussion with someone recently.  I'm going to break down a wall today.  That drives people nuts when I say that.  Oh, I know. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  People like babysitting.  It drives them insane when I say I'm babysitting my kid today.  Babysitting.  And they scream at me.  It's your kid.  You don't babysit your own kid.  What do you call it when you're not able to do anything you want to do?  Parenting.  It's called babysitting.  Parenting?  Parenting.  It's called babysitting.  Raising your child.  When you go home and realize, holy shit, I got ten things I want to do and I'm not going  to do any of them.  That could be different.  That means I'm babysitting.  No, you're raising your child.  No, parenting is when you get to maybe do one thing. 
[02:20:00]  Oh.  I got it all figured out.  And getting back to Dr. Michu Kaku.  Yes.  Shovelhead Jim on Twitter writes.  Shovelhead Jim.  Well, I'm sorry for the compliment, but he did write this part.  He writes, I love E.V.L.O.P., but even I felt the cringe with Michu Kaku.  Oh.  But then he writes, and this is what I say to all the people that are like.  Yeah.  He writes, he's too smart to figure out the obvious. 
[02:20:30]  That's true.  He wasn't smart enough to figure out the obvious.  So how good of a scientist could he be?  A lot of these guys are very book smart, but socially a little awkward.  And while he's trying to figure out the scientific reason why the phone was disconnecting, he  couldn't look into the fact that it was a joke.  That someone was just being a dick to him.  And being a dick, yeah.  There's no formula for being a dick that he can write out on a blackboard and be like,  oh, ah.  He could figure out the universe, but he can't figure out me. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  I got some easy tells.  That's what the deal is, though.  That's how a lot of these smart guys are.  You know, that's why they got a show on the Science Channel about that.  Yeah.  Yeah, guys.  Ingenious Minds.  Thank you.  It's so good.  It really is a great show.  Have you checked it out yet?  No, I have not.  These guys can't even figure out how to make their own fucking coffee, but they can tell  you how the universe works.  Yeah, no.  That type of shit.  The Mind is amazing, isn't it?  It's all about different savants that just do different stuff.  It's crazy, yeah.  It's really good. 
[02:21:30]  It really is a good show.  Bobo should be on that.  I was turned on.  He can't do anything.  Oh, that's right.  I was turned on to that because an idiot abroad promoted the hell out of this show,  so I said, what the hell?  Now I like two shows on the Science Channel.  Oh.  Ingenious Minds.  Yeah, it's worth a look.  I like how these channels that you never used to or would have thought of watching are doing  these original programs now that are just becoming all the rage, and then they're starting  the rip-off shows, too.  There's one called American Treasures that is exactly like American Pickers. 
[02:22:00]  Every channel has a hoarding show.  Yeah, yeah.  There's hoarding shows, and then there's the duplicate of I Almost Got Away With It.  It's the cuffed one.  I mean, yeah, and they're the same show.  Look, look at American Treasures.  It shows the pickup truck, and it's got the same kind of feel to it.  I don't know if the guys are sucking each other's dicks as they're driving the truck on  American Treasures.  Well, we don't know for sure if the other two are.  I didn't even say that.  I'm saying I don't know if the American Treasures guys are sucking each other's dicks. 
[02:22:30]  You know.  That was a bit suspect when they were in, huh?  I don't know what was going on there.  Oh, my God.  Share a bed.  What's the big deal?  Hey, two guys going antiquing around the world.  It's fascinating.  We haven't even touched in 17 years.  Oh, my God.  These guys are traveling around.  High-fiving, slapping each other's ass when they find a good gasoline sign from the 40s. 
[02:23:00]  They admit it to save money.  They share hotel rooms.  Oh, yeah.  Same bed.  You know, to save money.  Sleeping in the same bed.  One-bed hotel rooms.  Yeah.  But we're all supposed to continue to wonder.  And there's Pawn Stars and then there's Hardcore Pawn, both using the pawn word as porn.  You know, homophobia is all around us.  And I've got to keep this vague.  But someone in my circle, let's just say, big fan of that show. 
[02:23:30]  What show was it again?  American Pickers?  American Pickers.  Oh.  And I gave my observations after the interview.  As I'm giving this person T-shirts and mugs and all this paraphernalia from the show.  But then when I gave my observations, he didn't want anything to do with the T-shirt, the mug, or the showdown.  Oh, were you saying a few things that might have implied?  I just gave my observations.  I just gave my observations.  And this guy that's in my circles said, you know what? 
[02:24:00]  I can't have anything to do with this show anymore.  Wow.  Yikes, huh?  That's why I like keeping my dumb remarks based on things like skin color.  That way I could tell.  It's too bad, though, because it's still a terrific show.  And who cares what they might be doing when they're not picking it?  We don't know what they do in that van.  I don't even know why there's a black curtain between the back of the van and the cab. 
[02:24:30]  It's not closed off.  It's not a wall.  It's not some metal back there.  I don't know why they need that black curtain.  I don't know.  Why would you need to slip back there out of the line of camera shot?  Is that what happens?  I'm assuming.  No, I mean, they do have a black curtain.  Oh, yeah, there's a black curtain there.  Maybe it just looks better on TV.  I didn't know that.  Maybe it looks better on TV.  I don't know.  Let's just tell you the truth.  I would like to see what's happening with the stuff they bought.  How they fasten it down.  Yeah.  How it's not shifting as they're turning. 
[02:25:00]  They disappear from the cameras.  Yeah.  Sometimes, you know, sometimes they're in the back of the truck.  Are they doing evil things back there?  Well, as far as Jesus and God are concerned, I think it's pretty evil.  It's the most evil you could get.  Oh, boy.  Oh, thanks.  We really needed to see that evilness.  That's not going to make God happy.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  God's not happy with that type of behavior.  Hairless twinks. 
[02:25:30]  Tongue kissing.  Where'd you find that?  You certainly punched that up quickly.  Yeah, that's a little weird, Sam.  I Google imaged gay sucking.  Gays.  Oh, boy.  All right.  What do you want to do?  You want to do the Kathie Lee and Hoda thing?  That's what I've been living for.  Okay.  And hearing about the pizza party.  I want some pictures tweeted, too.  For what?  Pizza party. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because when I'm home...  Whose Twitter are we going to follow today for this?  I guess mine.  Not Sam?  Yeah.  On Twitter we'll be tweeting pretty much live pictures from the pizza party.  Well, you know.  Yeah.  I'll tweet.  I can't wait to see some of these pics.  Wait, I'm going to follow you today.  You don't follow me?  How do I follow you?  I was the first person you knew who had Twitter.  Yeah.  The wrestling stuff, though.  It just got to me after a while.  I don't just do wrestling.  How do I follow you, Sam? 
[02:26:30]  You just go to Not Sam and click Follow.  All right.  I'm going to do that.  Look what I do right now.  I'm officially following Sam.  Wow.  Look at that.  For a day.  For a day?  It's called Follow for a Day.  One day.  Make it good, and maybe I'll follow you for two days.  That'd be great.  Oh, Ant, I know we want to do the few minutes from Kathy Lee and Hoda, but...  Sure do.  Fucking this Charlie Sheen is really ripping you off, sir.  What now?  You started the crazy podcast. 
[02:27:00]  You did.  Crazy guy podcast, of course.  You did that.  Yes.  And now he's using your equipment.  Same equipment.  I'm on this.  Yeah.  Now, the latest, according to Have You Met Jay on Twitter, Sheen is making...  And I don't know if he's going for the joke or if this is real, and if it's real, you  should be really mad, sir.  Oh, boy.  He writes, Did you guys hear?  Charlie Sheen is making a cooking video for Funny or Die. 
[02:27:30]  It's true.  Wait, what?  It's true.  Where did that come from?  No, is this true, true?  It's true.  It hasn't been made yet.  All right, now I'm officially suspicious that Charlie Sheen is using you for some inspiration.  Now, that's...  Because you did your fine chicken in a bag video.  Chicken in a bag.  That did really, really well.  Chicken in a bag.  Charlie Sheen to launch a cooking show.  Winning recipes.  Funny or Die.  This is getting a little weird.  You didn't have a chef's hat in yours. 
[02:28:00]  No, but I had a gun.  That's true.  This is getting weird.  That looks like my kitchen.  Is Charlie Sheen at my house?  It does look like your kitchen.  Wait, is this real?  Fuck is...  Yes!  I swear it's real.  But it's been filmed.  Ant did a famous cooking video.  Hilarious self-aware spoof, or simply painful rehash of his catchphrases.  Actor Charlie Sheen has filmed a cooking show sketch for Funny or Die.  Charlie Sheen's winning recipes was filmed in Sheen's home, and he is very professional 
[02:28:30]  during the shoot.  Will it be intolerable as his live stream?  What the...  Hopefully not.  Apparently, the sweet tiger-striped chef had on Sheen's idea.  Maybe he'll make Charlie dogs and share his recipe.  You know what?  I've got to say something.  Come on.  Now this is...  That was my deal, Wade.  But it's time to say something. 
[02:29:00]  But when you say this, people go, ugh.  They actually do this when you say stuff like this.  Ugh.  Yeah.  There's a lot of funny places out there that are sucking off our show.  But for some reason, they don't want to bring us into the fold.  Siphoning.  We get it all the time from people.  I don't even feel like mentioning the places, but there's a bunch of places that suck ideas  off this show, but then when it comes to maybe doing something with the show, they  don't want to do it.  When is Funny or Die going to acknowledge us?  We're funny. 
[02:29:30]  They want us to die.  But we're funny.  There's probably someone at Funny or Die that listens to this show, and I know, I hear  it out there, ugh.  This is Howard.  You're doing Howard.  No.  That probably heard us talking about the chicken in a bag video that Anthony did really well,  and then brought the idea to the Funny or Die people and said, look, let's give this  one to Charlie.  I did a cooking show.  Yeah, you did.  Why? 
[02:30:00]  You did.  Was it on Funny or Die?  No.  You should have added it to Funny or Die.  That's your fault.  It was on you or tube.  There's some sucking going on, man.  They suck off this show, which is fine, as long as maybe you get us involved.  Well, Charlie Sheen is aware that things are going on with Anthony Cumia, the Twitter,  Anthony Cumia.  I think things are aware because of the TriCaster guy and that whole thing. 
[02:30:30]  And there's your Anthony Cumia.  Oh, look at the graphics.  I know.  Anthony Cumia, radio host.  Amazing chicken in a bag.  I'm cooking in a bag.  I got my Doyle Hargrave construction T-shirt on, and I'm cooking in a bag.  I'm cooking in a oven ready, a roaster in a bag.  Like the music, right?  It's not bad.  It's all the tastiness.  I went out the next day and bought a lav mic.  So anything I do now won't be as echoey.  I got to do that, too. 
[02:31:00]  That's great.  See, and I never acknowledge that I'm wearing a fucking piece in that.  I know.  Never acknowledge it.  It's on YouTube.  Where are we going for this?  It's a long video, Ann.  It's a long video.  It is.  It's seven minutes.  And it's very visual.  It's seven minutes.  Very visual.  And I guarantee this video, much funnier than Charlie Sheen's cooking video.  Just go to user.  And we haven't even seen the Charlie Sheen cooking video.  Opant XM.  Yes.  It's spelled like Opant XM.  Yeah, yes.  Opant?  O-P-A-N-T.  I think that's a painkiller.  Yeah.  Opant? 
[02:31:30]  Could you get me some Opant?  Opant XM.  If you've taken Opant and have liver problems, your ass might leak.  Yeah, with my dirty oven.  I wonder if his oven's going to be as filthy as my oven was.  And then you've got a fire thing happening.  And I did the line from Indiana Jones.  Whenever I poke my fire, I always go, your fire, it's dying.  Like that Nazi guy.  You've got a gun on your waist while you're doing that.  Well, you know what?  Who wouldn't?  Why not?  I guess so.  Is Charlie Sheen going to be packing a fucking Wilson Combat 45? 
[02:32:00]  I don't know.  Is he going to be singing karaoke while he's waiting for his chicken to cook?  I don't know.  Is he going to be playing Xbox with a gun on his waist?  I don't know.  Is he going to be playing Xbox and yelling to children?  I don't think so.  Is he going to be in his theater watching movies?  Sam, good news.  Everyone is in on the follow for a day.  Oh, they're going to follow you for a day.  Follow for a day.  I guess that's cool for today, but long-term thinking doesn't do much.  Well, we will give you two days. 
[02:32:30]  Playing dance central there.  You think he's going to be playing dance central?  Probably not.  With a .45?  Well, with a gun, yeah, on your waist.  You kind of know how to do that one.  That's kind of creepy.  It was the first time I ever did it, and I was actually hitting the marks.  You were doing good with dance central?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got tired.  And then you passed out.  I had to take a nap.  Oh, it's a nap.  All this is where – you call it a nap.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I just – it's kind of how I picture it. 
[02:33:00]  I didn't know you actually nap.  It looks the same way.  Okay, I didn't know.  Pass out and nap looks the same way.  I didn't know there was a difference.  It's on the couch.  I had no idea.  Wasn't that a great line from – was it Easy Money?  Oh, God.  Rodney Dangerfield, when he was trying to get sober, he said,  I don't know how to – I don't know how to sleep.  I just know how to pass out or something.  I forgot the exact line.  All right.  Why don't we do some Kathleen?  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm looking for.  You can check out the video yourself on the Opant XM. 
[02:33:30]  Opant XM.  Opant XM.  O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  XM.  You can see the chicken in a bag video.  Chicken in a bag.  A bunch of videos, actually.  Karaoke.  Crazy gun guy karaoke.  Just all – just having fun.  All right.  We all like our fun.  Yeah, we like our side fun.  Side fun becoming more fun than the bread and butter.  What did we say about the attitude?  That was – that was good attitude.  That was not at all.  That was a pretty good attitude right there. 
[02:34:00]  No.  Because when I'm making my silly shit, there's no one breathing down my fucking neck.  Okay.  Negativity is really starting to come through.  That's the best part, you know.  It's the best part.  It's just no one fucking –  Well, you know, I'm just going to do this, and no one's going to fucking critique it.  Well, they do critique it, but that's fine.  But I don't have the assholes critiquing it.  Give me shit.  Oh, I do have assholes critiquing it.  Where am I at?  I'm now very confused.  You've definitely gone a more negative route.  Yeah.  It's nice.  I don't have to have meetings about my side projects. 
[02:34:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This is the Kathy Lee.  Yeah.  And –  We could break because we just did good radio there.  It was good.  And Vulva Show.  What is her name?  Hoda.  Vulva?  Hoda.  Mulva?  Hoda.  Hoda.  Hoda.  I've taught you to smile.  I taught you to suck.  Hoda.  Hoda.  Hoda.  All right.  Hoda Doe. 
[02:35:00]  You want to do this now, Ann?  It's going to take some time.  I'm fine with that.  All right.  Let's try it.  So we –  Pop it in.  A bunch of people are going to laugh, but look, because of when we're on the radio,  you know, it's tough to watch this show because, you know, we're not near TVs at 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  If we're running over, we become completely fixated on it.  But I have seen this show on vacation a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  It's Kathie Lee, Gifford, and Hoda, and it's the extension of the Today Show. 
[02:35:30]  And the Today Show is obviously a staple, so they're trying to kind of keep it going after 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  When the professionals leave.  They thought this would work.  So they get these two to continue.  And some days they're drinking wine.  I think they might have a wine day or something.  Yeah.  Wine's Day.  Wine's Day, they call it?  Ah, Wine's Day.  Yesterday was Wine's Day.  Today's Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Sounds like something Scorch would do.  And they're really bad.  This could be the worst show on TV. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Their banter is, and I know this has been used plenty of times, but you almost think of  an SNL sketch.  It looks like an SNL sketch.  Yeah.  If SNL was to parody what they were supposed to be doing, it would be what they're doing.  It's god-awful.  It's so bad they can't parody it?  No, because it would be exactly what they're really doing.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah.  Okay.  It starts with Kathy Lee and Hoda bring something up, a topic for no reason. 
[02:36:30]  What's this mean?  Yeah, they just start, like, there's no semblance to this is where this is going, or hey, this  is interesting for the viewer.  And they're riffing.  Yeah, but they're not talking about anything.  Oh.  We're just saying, like, oh, this happened.  So?  Okay.  So?  All right, let's listen.  Kathy Lee and Hoda.  Tammy, our producer of our hour, is home today.  We know she's watching, and so we have a request to make, don't we, Hoda? 
[02:37:00]  Well, here's the deal.  We were supposed to be going to the royal wedding, and they found out and said no.  Now we're told we're not going anymore.  So we're trying not to take it personally, but Jim Bell, basically our executive producer,  said, we'll make it up to you if there's a place the two of you would like to go.  So we found our place.  We have discovered the place we'd like to go.  Ray Isle, who's often on our show, sent this to Kathy.  You guys have got to come.  Join us in.  Aspen!  For the Foon and Wide Classic.  June 17th through the 19th. 
[02:37:30]  This year.  That's what we want to do.  Okay, so there's a phone number, RSVP.  Who has a phone?  Who's going to call?  Call me, Kathy Lee and Hoda said, yes, we're on our way.  We're on the way.  All right, so there it is.  So what?  I don't want to do this.  Wow.  What happened?  That was painful.  They want to go to, like, you could have taken care of that off the air.  But they were making believe they were going to the royal wedding?  Yeah, of course they're not.  Like, why would they go to the royal wedding?  They don't know Hoda and Kathy Lee, so they made that up.  None of it makes any sense.  And why would they make that up to lead into the Aspen story? 
[02:38:00]  Just do it off the air.  Going to Aspen, bringing up everybody's name.  Nobody's interested.  No.  There was a name mentioned in there.  Yeah.  I know you don't remember, but I certainly do.  Who?  Jim Bell.  Think.  That sounds familiar.  He's a big-time executive producer now at NBC.  Oh.  Oh, right.  Okay.  I don't know how he got to that position, considering he was the producer of the XFL pregame show. 
[02:38:30]  And I'm sure that's not on his resume anymore.  We started out with good old Jim Bell.  And man, did he fucking rise in the ranks at NBC.  He's a major big shot now.  But there was a time, 10 years ago, he was the producer of the XFL pregame show.  It was a good show.  Or he overlooked it.  It was a good show.  Shut up.  The XFL was underrated.  Oh, was it?  I remember the day, like it was yesterday, that Jim Bell decided to stop talking to us. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, that was a good one.  Yeah.  Before that, it was all rah, rah, rah.  Get in here.  Get in here, guys.  Come on in, guys.  Come on in.  Hey, how's it going?  Let's talk about the show.  That's like, why did he just pass by without saying anything?  He didn't say a word.  I don't understand.  Because he knew it was coming down.  How cool was it for a week to be able to walk in and out of 30 Rock?  It was kind of nice.  It was really cool.  It's like, yeah, we work here.  Don't worry about it.  Yep.  Yeah, this is good.  Yep.  NBC, motherfuckers.  Yeah, 30 Rock. 
[02:39:30]  This is going to lead right to SNL.  I know.  Yeah.  I know it.  What?  Why isn't the card working anymore?  What happened?  Fast forward 10 years, and we're still doing this shit.  That was our big chance.  That was it.  There's a pizza party today.  Yeah, yeah, but you know, some never went to a pizza party at 30 Rock.  Right.  Nope.  They were setting up.  Okay, we got more, Kathy Lee and Hoda.  They were setting up a bad radio bit here.  Yeah, thank God that that great bit that we just heard led to something. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, good.  We might lose our audience.  I'm hoping this clip keeps their attention, because they're on the fence right now.  It may not.  All right.  If you are traveling, and a lot of people are, because it's spring break time,  there are certain things that are just so incredibly annoying for travelers.  Oh, my gosh.  The list is long.  This show.  A couple of things they say that travelers don't like is, number one,  when someone behind them is kicking the back of their seat.  Or reclined so far back, although I've just recently discovered,  on the way back from Chukamaca, they don't even let you recline much at all.  They don't recline that much, but it's too far when they're in front of you reclining, 
[02:40:30]  especially when your tray's up, and there's not room to move.  And you've got their hair in your dinner.  Nobody likes that.  That's right, they don't serve dinner, so you're fine there, and you're chips.  Like you're ever in coach.  They're doing the most annoying things that happen when you travel.  Yeah.  You couldn't have one creative thought?  No.  To do something different?  No.  It's television.  I don't like those peanuts. 
[02:41:00]  I don't like the airplane peanuts.  I don't even have anything to say.  Like, airplane material is known for being the hackiest thing you could do.  It's been touched upon.  With Gilligan's Island, professor, can't fix the hole in the boat bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what's her problem?  People kick her seat?  Yeah.  Because she doesn't like when you're on either end. 
[02:41:30]  She doesn't like getting her seat kicked, but she also doesn't like when people recline in front of her.  Maybe it's not someone kicking.  Maybe Giff's behind her, and it's the head of a hooker blowing him and hitting the back of her seat.  No wonder she's so annoyed.  Wow, she so doesn't want that brought up anymore.  Oh, of course she doesn't.  Why would you do that?  I'm here to bring it up on a daily basis.  She really thought at this point everyone forgot about that, Ant.  Because she has a holier-than-then fuck attitude where she loves to put across that she's got the perfect little family and everything with her son who, if you ask me, might have had a little too much Kathie Lee mothering in his life. 
[02:42:00]  Have we seen him lately?  Cody?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He reminds me of a friend I used to have back in California.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Be careful.  Reminds me of this guy Richard.  Be careful.  Dangerous territory right now.  I'm just saying.  All right.  He reminds me of him a little.  He actually does.  Okay.  He kind of looks like a little chubbier version of him. 
[02:42:30]  His face is a little fatter, but he's got a Richard look to him.  Look how much hair he's got, though.  You've got to appreciate that.  Oh, that's from Giff.  Yeah.  Giff had a good head of hair.  He's got the good head of hair.  Under that leather football helmet when he was playing in the 20s.  Jesus.  They spent a minute and a half talking about a bag.  What do you mean?  Protected sex?  No.  Because that would be interesting. 
[02:43:00]  Wait a minute.  Just a bag.  A bag.  You know trying to fit bags?  Oh, so they were talking about Kathie Lee.  Oh.  See?  She's a bag.  The overhead compartment.  In a plane?  They're still doing the plane thing.  Oh, they're still doing the plane.  Yes.  That's the thing that's also annoying, I think.  The overhead bag space.  First of all, for some reason, I bring a big bag on the plane.  I wonder what.  It's called your purse.  I mean.  She's a superwoman. 
[02:43:30]  What?  She just has a big purse, I guess, but it didn't make any sense to me as a viewer.  I mean, she doesn't walk around with her purse on the show.  It's called your purse.  I need room to breathe.  Well, and people scowl at you because your bag's too big.  And it's not too big because it fits if you just jam it.  It happens to Florentine's bag's too big.  For your bag to fit, you have to jam everybody else's things if they place very nicely up there.  Are they talking about guck?  Yeah, you've got to cram it in.  It makes it a lot more fun to listen to this clip if you think they're talking about guck. 
[02:44:00]  Shove your bag in.  I think they're talking about booyah.  The booyah video.  Oh, can we see booyah?  Yeah.  I like to think that they're doing booyahs.  When you shove your bag in, and then you've got to pull it out, and it pops.  Look, let's be honest with each other.  This segment is failing miserably.  So what we need to do now is just picture they're talking about guck.  Guck, the guck.  And then it makes this clip so much more fun to listen to.  So we'll move back here now.  They're talking about guck.  That's the thing that's also annoying, I think.  Maybe you could do some beeps with this. 
[02:44:30]  Ah, this could be.  I already heard a couple instances where it could have been beeped.  The overhead bag space.  First of all, for some reason, I bring a big bag on the plane.  I wonder what.  It's called your purse.  I need room to breathe.  Well, and people scowl at you because your bag's too big.  And it's not too big because it fits if you just jam it.  For your bag to fit, you have to jam everybody else's things that they place very nicely.  I've seen you in action. 
[02:45:00]  I politely say, whose backpack is this?  And then they say mine.  I say, would you mind terribly if I just moved it from this overhead to this one?  It's right near you.  Yes, I would fucking mind.  They look at you like venom.  It's literally, I moved it one foot because there's not room for my big bag.  Listen, sister, I got here early.  Yes.  I put my bag up.  It's first come, first serve.  Okay, wait.  When you're in row, let me tell you the worst road to be in, especially if you're on JetBlue,  six.  Because they board one through five.  I was in six.  Then they board 29 through six. 
[02:45:30]  You're the last one on.  So when you get on, there's no room to put your bag.  And you have a bag too.  And mine needs room.  Here's the thing.  You learn a little discipline in life and you get rid of the bowling ball that's in your purse.  I need all the things in there.  But I do think people are incredibly rude when it comes to that.  But I have to admit, when I'm sitting in my seat and someone's trying to jam a bag up there,  I scowl too.  I'm like, why are they bringing all that?  Because mine is neatly tucked away and safe.  What bothers me is when there's somebody who's obviously having trouble with it and nobody helps. 
[02:46:00]  You know, I mean, come on.  A little chivalry goes a long way.  All right.  Before you guys say.  End of story.  So to speak.  Before you guys say that was a complete waste of time, just remember that clip when we put all the beeps in after the break.  Yes.  It's going to sound terrific.  I heard all the places where the beeps go.  It's going to sound like they're taking a lot of cock.  That's right.  It's going to sound like they're taking a lot of cock.  I know you're saying, please make it stop, Kevin, from Connecticut.  But trust me, that was the setup.  To a five minute and a half of audio you're going to hear after the break with the beeps in it. 
[02:46:30]  Thank you.  That's terrible.  Why is it terrible?  The show.  You've never had a deal with an overhead?  What the fuck is it?  You know what?  I go in.  I put it in there.  Yeah.  I put it on the overhead that's right over my fucking seat.  Yeah.  And it fits.  We're doing what they're doing.  And that's it.  That's all I'm saying.  Oh, right now?  Now we're talking about it.  Now we're talking about it.  Oh, no, no.  But I'm talking about this fucking bitch making it sound like it's other people's problems 
[02:47:00]  that she's bringing a big bag on the fucking plane.  You fucking...  There's a reason there's size regulations.  Uh-oh.  Exactly.  Your boy Hannity's being accused of using the fake fucking phone calls, too.  On his radio show?  Yep.  Oh, shit.  Another article just came out.  They're saying Hannity, Limbaugh, and Beck accused of using that service.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That could bring down radio. 
[02:47:30]  Why don't they just have me call?  Well, apparently I do a great job of making great calls to radio shows, whether I hate  them or not.  That's a great question.  Great question, turd.  God, did I fuck that up?  No, it was a good call.  I think it was a perfect call.  It was a great call.  It was a perfect call.  Fucking articulate.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Good point.  That company should have hired you, because you make a perfect call.  Oh, yeah.  And you can play characters.  That's perfect for you. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  I got a call last night from XM Satellite Radio again.  Oh, nice.  They wanted to know if the XM that was discontinued in my Escalade was because I wasn't happy with  the service.  Please say you hate Opie and Anthony.  No, I said, well, I got a newer Escalade, and that was disconnected from the old one.  I go, I've already had this call.  I've already had this call.  And he said, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And I go, where do you work out of? 
[02:48:30]  He was like, oh, Indiana.  I said, well, you listen to XM?  He goes, yeah, yeah.  I have it for my vehicle and stuff.  And I think it's just doing the corporate line.  And I go, you listen to the Opie and Anthony radio show?  And he's like, oh, yeah.  He goes, that's the reason I got XM.  He goes, my buddy turned me on to it and everything.  I go, okay.  How ridiculous is it that you're calling Anthony to fucking hook up the radio?  To hook up the radio.  He goes, no way. 
[02:49:00]  Get out of here.  Oh, shit.  I'm like, no.  I go, I work there.  I go, don't you people do any research that it's like the guy?  Would you call fucking Bill Gates and ask him if he wants some Microsoft products?  Huh?  That's too good.  I think he can just get it.  Yeah, they keep calling me.  And then he freaked out and he actually went off script and started cursing.  Oh, really?  It's like, dude, I fucking love the fucking show, motherfucker.  They're not good.  And then I thought it was a really stupid idea of me to do that because he probably gave the 
[02:49:30]  number to all of his friends.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, no.  Now you're going to hear from all of them.  Hey, this guy works for Funny or Die.  Oh, he does?  Is this Jim from L.A. that I know?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  See, I know all you guys.  Jim.  I know all the players.  I know all the players on Twitter.  Movers and shakers?  He's a mover and shaker.  He's a fan of the show and he works out there in L.A.  And he gets his fucking fingers involved in a lot of things.  Yeah.  See, Jim, I know you.  He's in there.  He's in there.  Yeah.  A little this, a little that.  He's almost in the know out there. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, really.  You work for Funny or Die.  I did not know that part of the story.  I actually do all the construction in the building.  I'm their only guy.  Oh, so you have nothing to do with the creative.  You unplug their toilets.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  And I know everybody.  I got the keys to the building.  Ask around.  I want to know if we're on the Funny or Die radar.  That's what I'm saying.  I mean, I know all those guys.  I know, you know, Will Ferrell.  I know Chris Henshie.  I know Dick Glover.  Dick Glover is like the head guy of Funny or Die. 
[02:50:30]  They're becoming pretty big.  And, you know, we've made Will Ferrell laugh on the phone.  So I need to know if he knows us.  Yeah, I can do whatever you want.  I actually do some reconnaissance when you're walking around with that plumber.  Yeah.  Actually, can I say something?  I meant to say plunger.  Plunger.  Plunger.  Yeah.  It works much better if you say plunger instead of plumber.  Fuck.  Maybe he knows the plumber.  You're the handyman.  Are you the handyman?  Yeah.  I wouldn't say handyman.  I hate that term.  But, yeah, I could do it. 
[02:51:00]  You know, I'm a contractor.  I just actually built the Oprah Winfrey Network.  Okay.  Oh, you did?  I built, like, a three-month project.  Did you reinforce the stage?  It wasn't the stage.  It was the corporate office.  It was actually all the corporate office.  Right.  It wasn't serious.  I know.  I love when they give you the real answer.  No, no, no.  I didn't reinforce the stage because she's really fat and would actually collapse the stage with her human weight.  You were just there for the setup for a nice line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't want an answer.  No, no, no. 
[02:51:30]  What I did was I moved a couple of registers around the ceiling.  Right.  I had to put in a window and a wall.  And it was a bearing wall, so it was very hard to head her off.  I was there.  Right.  We were.  I was there one day when Elo was there.  We were having this meeting, and they were like, okay, we had to leave early because, God forbid, that the construction guys are there when Oprah's there.  Well, next time you see Elo, tell him to lose my number.  He did already.  I didn't see him either.  She doesn't like the help?  And they're, oh, my God, Oprah's going to be here. 
[02:52:00]  And the second guy they mentioned was Elo.  I'm like, oh, my God, Elo.  They said Eric Logan.  But I'm like, oh, my God, Elo's going to be here.  Like, I fucking know the guy or something.  Yeah, you should have went to his computer and put cockpicks up.  He loves cockpicks.  Yeah, I know.  I finally found out what he does for the Oprah.  What?  Yeah.  He pops her zits.  Oh.  On her back where she can't reach.  And it's actually Discovery Channel forked out all the cash for that.  She didn't put it out in any case.  Wow.  Righteous. 
[02:52:30]  Nice.  Steve from Bayshore.  Holy shit.  It's great.  He didn't write her pimples.  He wrote something else that rhymes with pimp.  Hmm.  Oh, I know it.  And called them pimples.  Oh, my God.  That's Steve from Bayshore.  I'm uncomfortable now.  It's just really, what was the word I'm looking for?  Racially insensitive?  No.  Oh, a genius.  Oh.  Yeah, that's what I was looking for.  Oh, my God.  Two different directions.  All right, Jim and L.A., do some recon for us. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to know if we're on the funny or die radar.  Because Charlie Sheen's doing a video that seems like it's going to be similar to what  Ant did already.  Yeah, he's ripping you guys off.  If he's doing cooking and then does things in between the cooking, then I'm really going  to be suspect.  And I am the most modest.  Never say anyone's ripping off.  I got a lot of people that have the same ideas and stuff.  But the past week with this Charlie Sheen has been a little crazy.  Yeah, I'll be there Monday afternoon.  All right.  I got another job to look at, so. 
[02:53:30]  Hoo-hoo.  I'll ask around.  All right.  You were such a bore, I started eating my fucking breakfast.  I build things.  Do you know how important that is to the world?  Yes, Doyle.  All right.  I guess you're done.  All right, gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Thanks, Jim.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Buddy.  Yeah.  Call me buddy pal.  I'm not your friend.  Hey, Kathy Lee and Hoda.  Champ.  Let's get these two clips out of the way.  Yeah, please. 
[02:54:00]  They find no reason to do some product placement for Starbucks.  Wow.  There's nothing.  There's no setup.  There's just product placement.  On Friday, I'm going to Seattle.  Isn't Seattle the hometown of Starbucks?  And Starbucks is having a big anniversary.  Check out.  We're going out new this week.  This is their logo.  Brand new.  Yeah.  They took away the word Starbucks coffee and just have the picture of the lady.  I don't know why.  Because, you know, okay, here's something funny.  I did this thing for Dateline where we were showing young three-year-olds logos for different 
[02:54:30]  things.  Kids three years old saw the logo and pointed it and said, Mommy's Coffee.  Like, they knew because they just cleaned the logo.  That's funny.  Maybe it's so well-branded now that there's no need.  Anyway, cheers and congratulations to them.  It was the first one open in 19, I think it said 81?  Yes.  71.  Exactly.  So here's that.  Was that the funny part?  Did I hit it perfectly?  You got it.  Here's something funny.  She said it was funny, and it was.  I thought that was the funny part.  It sounded like it was the funny part.  She didn't disappoint.  Kids recognize logos. 
[02:55:00]  That's Mommy's Coffee.  Shut up.  Hope the kid pulls it off the table and it hits him in the head.  That's not nice.  It's a thousand degrees.  Now that I'm a father, I can't be part of that humor.  That's okay.  Good bird.  I understand.  You can sit back.  I'll be the despicable shithead that just keeps blurting out horrid children stories.  I don't care.  Honestly, I don't care as long as it's not my kid.  All right?  Yeah.  That's how everybody is.  I still laugh when other kids trip and fall and shit.  It's hysterical.  Sheesh.  All right.  They mentioned Charlie Sheen by saying they didn't mention him and include a bit that 
[02:55:30]  wasn't thought out well.  We have not mentioned somebody's name.  You know whose name we have not mentioned are open, and we've mentioned his name over  and over.  The prostitute that Giff was with in the hotel room?  That he was trying to fuck in the ass?  Her?  Did you hear me earlier?  Her?  She's hoping at this point everyone has moved on from there.  Oh, see.  I forgot about that.  I thought that's what they were going to...  And you bringing it up like this is not helping.  I thought she was going to bring it up, though.  It's like, you know whose name we haven't mentioned?  The hooker that Giff tried to fuck in the ass, and it was on surveillance camera. 
[02:56:00]  But then she would have been bringing it up.  She really doesn't want to be bringing that up.  You see what I mean?  Oh, okay.  Now I see.  You got confused.  I didn't before.  I got confused again.  Please.  I'm sorry.  I want to apologize.  Please.  She really is hoping that enough time has gone by.  We have not mentioned somebody's name.  You know whose name we have not mentioned are open, and we've mentioned his name over  and over.  Giff.  Because she said, hey, Giff, the husband that tried to put his big penis into a hooker's 
[02:56:30]  ass in a hotel room while he was married to Kathy Lee and still is married to Kathy Lee.  Remember a minute ago, I said.  That's the subject.  But I said the hooker.  No, no, no.  Before.  It wasn't a matter of the subject itself.  Oh, oh, like she doesn't want to hear it at all.  No, it's a bit touchy.  It's a bit touchy.  Oh, that makes more sense.  It's a touchy situation for a Christian woman like Kathy Lee Gifford.  Oh, oh.  I was proud of my Ash Wednesday tweets yesterday, by the way.  I'm going to say that. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, the Ash Wednesday Twitter extravaganza, as they call it.  I was sniping people.  I called sniping people.  I just hang out in the trending topic, and then I find one that just really annoys me,  and then I fucking reply to their awful tweet, and I snipe them.  Oh, that's a good idea.  And then they get confused, like, who is this person, or why are they following you?  Why are they doing this to me?  I was very proud of the dust-to-dust one.  What's going on with Ash Wednesday?  That was yesterday, right? 
[02:57:30]  Wyden's Day.  I'm going to...  This is self-promotion.  I'll admit it, but someone wrote...  Oh, here it is.  Laura.  People.  I have...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Hold on.  I don't like that one.  Hold on, hold on.  Where's the fucking Ash?  Was Laura the name of that hooker that...  Oh, okay.  I don't think so.  It was Casey Sunshine.  And when someone's called Casey Sunshine...  Wow.  Casey put it where the sun doesn't shine.  Perhaps that's a little more accurate, because Gifford, he was trying to... 
[02:58:00]  He was trying to fuck her in the ass, Opie.  No, no, no.  Is what he was trying to do.  I don't think that's what Opie was bringing up.  So under the...  Oh.  Because Kathleen doesn't want to talk about that.  Oh, my mistake.  It's okay.  Under the hashtag Ash Wednesday, Casey Sunshine writes,  Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.  That's nice.  So I decided to snipe her.  I call it sniping.  I write, but some have a little more dust.  Right, Casey?  Oh.  Meaning when she's long gone, her dust pile is going to be a bit bigger. 
[02:58:30]  A little bigger?  Right.  Does that actually work on...  Like, do fat people leave more dead person dust?  I'm thinking they do.  I mean...  I don't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Sam is...  With a look.  With a look, he got him.  I didn't say anything.  He slightly turned his head to the right and looked through the window at our own E-Rock.  Just for a time cue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Here's a quick snipe. 
[02:59:00]  You've still got some time left in the show.  Is it going to look like a sand dune when he dies?  That's that cool.  Like a Saharan sand dune?  It's going to be the dust bowl all over again.  Ah!  Ah!  The grapes of wrath.  Right.  The dust bowl.  That's what I was...  Then, uh...  Ah!  Here was a quick one.  Yeah.  Steph Ann Burry on Twitter.  Uh-huh.  She wrote, uh, for Ash Wednesday Tech, she wrote, uh, why on days of fasting can I not avoid  thinking of food? 
[02:59:30]  And I took a, you know, a quick look at her profile pic, and I just wrote, wow, how fat  are you?  Oh, no.  She just wants to talk about...  See, I sniped that one.  She wants to be nice, and...  I'm starting to realize something.  Yeah.  Opie is a cyber bully.  Oh, yeah.  You know, cyber bullying is just as bad as real-life bullying.  Let's stop cyber bullying.  Yeah.  In its tracks.  And read my profile, because people get really mad. 
[03:00:00]  I go, I like to make fun of people I know I'm stronger than.  But that's what everyone does.  Dot, come on board and stop cyber bullying.  What...  Doesn't work?  Would you humor me with...  I don't know that she's slogan?  Humor me with one more.  Yeah?  Uh, because this came up a lot under the Ash Wednesday tag.  People, I have ashes on my head.  Please stop staring.  So I wrote, OMG, you're so witty.  And then I started a new hashtag, wish it was from cigarette. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, that somebody would have put their cigarette, or perhaps a cigar, out on their forehead.  And, um...  That would have hurt.  That would have...  Ow.  A little sting.  I want to leave you with one more rant.  Leave you.  I think this one you would appreciate.  Uh-huh.  Ash Wednesday.  And I wrote, I suggest black people use baby powder so they look silly, too.  Oh, boy.  That's racial.  Oh, boy.  That, uh...  Is that bad?  You've gone way over the line there, David Duke.  Is that bad? 
[03:01:00]  Wow.  Is that a bad one?  That's bad.  Why?  Because, uh, when black people get ashes for Ash Wednesday, uh, you could see it anyway.  No, you can't.  Uh, it's like a black tattoo.  If they're a little light, you could kind of see it better.  You can't?  Yeah.  I'm thinking, though, if it's baby powder, then everyone knows for sure.  How do you get the white eye?  Because I know the ashes come from burnt palm leaves.  Do they really, though?  They burn palm.  You think every church has time to burn their fucking palm leaves?  They better.  Make it legit.  Or are they just getting some ashes from the fireplace or something? 
[03:01:30]  You know what?  You know what?  You think about, uh, well, maybe not you, but I have.  Uh, the communion wafer, the host, Jesus's body.  Oh, yeah.  Um, and, and it, it looks so holy, and they, they hold it, they got the towel and the thing  and the silver goblet thingy and the plate.  Mm-hmm.  It's just a lot of pomp and circumstance.  There's a factory just pumping these fucking things out on an assembly line. 
[03:02:00]  Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.  And boxing them up, and then, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, there's a tractor trailer bringing  it to a loading dock.  And just dropping in front of churches like you're dropping off the, the, uh, the newspaper  bundle.  First, it's got to go into a loading dock.  Yeah.  Is this how it is made?  Yeah.  Okay.  And it backs up, and then it's some, some guy, uh, didn't have an education, perhaps, 
[03:02:30]  uh, wishing he had a better job, is just throwing boxes of the body of Jesus onto pallets, and  then the forklift operator takes them, and then they get put on smaller trucks that go  to the churches.  Shouldn't they use a little more care if it's the body of Jesus?  You would think it would be taken to a church on golden chariots.  Nice.  Just golden chariots, bring them.  But they're just like any other product, boxed up, stacked.  There's people there with, uh, the little paper hat on and gloves, sorting out broken 
[03:03:00]  Jesus body hosts.  Making seven cents an hour.  So they could be ground up for some other product.  I guarantee that's a job for Thailand.  Oh, and they sit there with that, like, I'm bored look on their face, just sorting through  the body of Christ.  How it's made.  How it's made.  Communion wafers.  You know what factory?  What?  The Necco factory.  The Necco wafer factory.  That's where they make those.  They just take the sweets out.  Yeah, they save the sugar for the...  And pump in some kind of bread.  The real Necco's.  Is it bread product?  Because it's supposed to be bread. 
[03:03:30]  Um, it tastes...  Bread and wine, you know, the body of Christ.  And why do we have to share the wine with all the other fucking creeps in the church?  Yeah, for some reason that's supposed to be...  Oh, but they use the magic fucking towel.  Magic towel, they wipe it off.  And it gets rid of all the diseases.  It's the Jesus towel.  Yeah, so it gets rid of...  He cured lepers.  It gets rid of all the herpes and everything else that people are fucking...  Herpes ain't nothing.  Popping in the wine?  Yeah, what if you turn to your side and see some guy there and he's just, like, got a  big fucking shanker on his lip?  I don't do the wine.  And then...  You don't do the wine there? 
[03:04:00]  When I go to church every...  At the church?  Once every five years, I don't do the wine.  No, you eat the body, you don't drink the blood?  I eat the body.  Eat the body, yeah.  Jesus blood.  Jesus blood.  Get on it.  Oh, nice.  Ah, duh.  Winning.  Nice.  Yeah.  I just...  That's a very good question.  I was just wondering.  It's like, yeah.  They should do a how it's made with that.  Because they're so holy that you would think they would be...  I guess because maybe they bless them later.  Yeah.  Do they bless them at the factory?  They kind of like...  Is there a priest that goes there and, like, just stands at the assembly line going, like, 
[03:04:30]  all day long?  He's just blessing these things?  Is there flying tens of thousands at a clip off of a conveyor belt?  Can I ask you something because you're all-knowing?  I try to be.  A lot of kid-touching that went on, right?  Yeah, in the church.  And then the priests are handling the body of Jesus.  Body of Jesus.  And you're online to get the body of Jesus.  But did he wash his hands after he was doing some of those awful things?  Priests seem to always be washing their hands.  They're dipping them in the water.  Is that why they're doing that, you think?  And it's a big ritual with the... 
[03:05:00]  You know, they take the towel...  Looks exhausting.  ...and they pat their hands.  And there's a lot of folding of the cloths.  Gotta keep everything very sacred.  And laying down and folding over.  And that whole ritual with the cup when he drinks the wine.  And it's like three swigs.  And then he's got to take the towel and...  Like Joe the bartender, he gets in there.  Yeah.  But he dramatically drinks the wine.  And then I guess you're sitting there waiting for the divine enter...  Something to happen.  Something to happen.  Some kind of...  Yeah, spirit.  Is he getting the sign? 
[03:05:30]  And then God's like, okay, now you can give the wine to everybody else.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I just gave you the sign.  Take another sip.  Now, clean that glass out.  Clean the friggin' goblet.  Whatever it is.  The...  The grail.  That does take forever.  And then they do the thing with the towel.  And then they gotta take the towel and they fold it.  And they put it on top of the cup.  And then he does this?  And then they do the little prayer.  And then he gets down and says a few...  Right.  ...prayers to himself like some quiet shit.  You think he's still saying something? 
[03:06:00]  At that moment or he's been through the motions?  He's like, oh my god, I'm so hungover.  I don't believe I just want to drink wine.  I'm gonna puke.  That would be me.  Yeah.  Be like, oh god.  Captain Morgan in there.  Maybe I could get the Johnson kid to be an altar boy.  Yeah.  That kid's cute.  See him in the third row there with his parents.  How do I separate him from his parents?  You walk that candle up there.  You walk that big candle-y stick up here.  I'm having a rough time with these fucking priests.  Oh, boy.  I'm breaking out of character.  These fucking pieces of shit. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, boy.  Just fucking up innocent lives.  What are you gonna have to do?  And then the church is moving them around like they're trading fucking sports players.  You're gonna send your kid to a church for some kind of religion?  Is he gonna get that little pre-religion before he chooses for himself?  Someone asked me yesterday, did he get the ashes for you and the kid?  I'm like, no fucking priest is ever touching my kid.  Even with the thumb?  Nope.  Right on the head?  Nope. 
[03:07:00]  Nope.  It was thick in there.  And I'll do a little religion so I get him on the road and then he'll decide.  Nope.  Yeah.  Yep.  No fucking Catholic school.  None of that shit.  He should just have like an ash paintball gun and just line people up and blast him in  the forehead.  Make it fun, right?  Yeah.  Make it a little more thrilling.  A little challenging also.  Like Jackass 3.  You get one of those jet engines and just kind of take a shoebox full of ash off.  A shoebox full of ash and just throw it in.  I forgot about that bit when Knoxville was on.  Oh, that was a good one. 
[03:07:30]  I should have re-watched the movie.  That was a good one.  I would have been more prepared.  I forgot about the fucking jet engine shit.  Yeah.  That was insane.  How did they go to their lawyers and get that done?  And we have such a hard time getting anything done.  And they were throwing debris into the backblast of a jet engine and letting it fly and hit  people.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's why I can't think too hard about this anymore because it doesn't make sense.  Is Sam working on the beeps for that one clip? 
[03:08:00]  I'm sure Sam is working diligently.  Do you want to hear the last one about Charlie Sheen?  Unless, of course, his DNA comes back a certain way and then I would think he's probably sleeping  or napping on the job.  Here's Hoda and Kathie Lee.  We're trying a new bit.  I'm not really sure if it worked.  I think what they're doing is despicable.  I kind of like it.  Yeah.  I keep saying despicable to plug Jimmy's CD that's out.  Well, if Sam comes back with that one clip with the beeps in it, then I think we save 
[03:08:30]  this half hour.  That'd be good.  Yeah.  And we should get a pizza party update before we get out of here.  I'm just talking to the guys down the hall now.  Please.  I want to know what's going on.  Here's Charlie Sheen stuff.  We have not mentioned somebody's name.  You know whose name we have not mentioned are open and we've mentioned his name over  and over over the last.  Jerry?  No.  Charlie Sheen.  Oh, that's because we kind of feel like we listen to you guys and you've been telling  us enough already. 
[03:09:00]  You've had it.  So if you've really, really, really had it, we're not talking about it today, but there  is something that you can block Charlie Sheen from your computer.  Like a beta blocker?  Yes.  It's like a Charlie blocker.  So you go on the computer and then you somehow you block it.  You press something and this is what happens.  It just goes away.  Yeah.  And so every time you really can't get away from it because you can just on a TV set.  Oh, so we have heard you and we, we, we, yes, we have listened. 
[03:09:30]  Unless, you know, something else happens.  It's a news word.  Wow.  Why don't we, why don't we just do it?  Let's go do TV.  It's time.  I think there's nothing.  It's fucking time.  Nothing could be worse than that.  How much do they pay these dopes?  Nothing could be worse.  Why?  Is somebody that, that hired them trying to do things to protect their job right now?  Huh?  Whoever hired them and gave the go ahead, are they, are they doing something like, oh  my God, I gotta, I gotta work extra hard. 
[03:10:00]  I don't know.  I gotta make myself really seem.  I feel bad for the women because that's representing you.  That's, that's the type of humor I guess women want to hear.  Oh, you broads.  Yeah.  Oh, with that cackling babble.  And you know, the type of women that just sit there and would love that shit.  Oh God.  How do guys stay married to him?  I don't know.  Stupid fat pigs.  Yeah, they would just sit there watching that and loving it.  Oh God. 
[03:10:30]  What's up with the Charlie Sheen today?  What's up with the, did you hear about the Charlie Sheen?  They're always a week and a half, two weeks behind everything as far as like topical subjects  go?  Ah.  Like people that send me fucking shit on Twitter.  Did you hear us talking about this on the air?  Okay.  Did you see I retweeted it two weeks ago?  Did you see it?  Whatever.  It's like, do I, look, uh, wow.  Wow, that does look like my gun closet. 
[03:11:00]  I get it.  I've seen that thing 8,000 fucking times.  You're a dick, dude.  What?  You're a dick.  You're a dick.  I always thought you were nice, but you're a dick.  I'm trying to fucking share something.  I can't keep track of everything you looked at.  Assume I saw it.  Right.  If it came out yesterday, I saw it.  God, you're so right.  I got one.  I'm going to save some, some people out there.  Yeah.  If you're thinking of tweeting, how much coke did Charlie Sheen do? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, boy.  Don't do it.  No.  It was sent to me probably a hundred times yesterday alone.  Yeah.  Probably.  I should count.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the answer, of course, is to kill two and a half men.  Yeah.  Don't do it.  Please don't do that.  There are so many.  You're going to embarrass yourself.  They're like, hey, check this out.  You click the link and it's like, you motherfucker, you made me click that link.  Why would you send it to me thinking I haven't seen that joke? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  You're behind.  Way the fuck behind.  See, your jobs are to do whatever you do at your job.  Our job is to know what this shit is.  Try to be on top as much as possible.  Part of our actual job is looking this shit up and seeing these videos and shit that's  going on on the internet.  So while you're working, we've already, we've already seen this.  Yeah.  There's maybe one out of, I gotta say, 50. 
[03:12:30]  I was going to go higher.  You were going to go a hundred, right?  More.  I was thinking, really?  That, that you're sending me that I haven't seen.  But, uh, yeah.  I just got completely distracted by some girl on TV.  Oh my God.  That's so your type.  Troy and Bellisario.  You have a type, man.  I do.  That's your type.  They have vaginas.  Pretty little liars, actress.  Troian. 
[03:13:00]  That's not a J, right?  Troian.  She's kind of cute.  If Sam makes a stay past fucking 10 o'clock, there's going to be hell to pay.  Oh, man.  How long does it take to put beeps in that dumb clip?  I don't know, but, uh, let me, let me tell you something.  Yeah.  I will, uh, let you know.  Yeah.  I'll hear it on the way home and let you know how funny it was.  And where's Roland?  I want to know if the pizza party is set up and ready to go.  Pizza party.  Pizza party.  Bring Roland here.  Oh, look.  And E-Rock's back.  E-Rock, we were talking very highly about your videos. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, I heard.  Oh, what's the bikini one?  It's not her.  Oh, it's not her?  She's all right.  Anthony, they did do how it's made on the communion thing.  No, they didn't.  Kyle in Tennessee, did they really?  Eh.  Yeah, I saw it a couple, uh, years ago, and it's, uh, a little factory in Rhode Island,  I think, or something.  They make, like, 75% of all the communion wafers in the world or the U.S. or something.  It's just a huge factory stamping out communion wafers every day by the truckload.  Is it blessed at the factory? 
[03:14:00]  Nope.  No, no.  I believe it's blessed individually at each church.  Oh, so that's why they were able to treat it like shit, because it isn't really...  It's not the body of Jesus.  It's just some bread byproduct when they're shipping it out, so it's like nothing.  So what?  And then once it gets, uh, blessed, then it becomes, uh, holy.  So what happens?  Like, you sprinkle a little, uh, that magic dust on there, and it becomes the body of Jesus?  I don't even think you need magic dust.  I think the priest just got to say something over it.  I love the religious people that are outraged by Harry Potter.  Really?  Yeah, it's magic. 
[03:14:30]  Really?  The guy says magical words over it, and the communion wafer, which came out of a factory  and meant nothing as far as religion goes.  It was just a piece of Wonder Bread smashed on a countertop.  Uh, all of a sudden, you say some magical words, and it becomes a holy object that is not  to be, uh, screwed with, not to be dropped on the floor, and it means something when you  take it into your body.  And most likely, the person, uh, sprinkling the magic dust and doing the magic words... 
[03:15:00]  Magic words.  ...was touching a fucking kid.  Oh, boy.  Get the fuck out of here!  I'm done!  They love their...  And for the people that are going to now beat me up again over this, I believe in shit.  I don't...  I'm not sure...  Magic?  I'm not sure where I believe where I'm at.  In a young girl's eyes?  I'm not sure where I'm at with, uh, organized religion, but I believe in shit.  I like disorganized religion.  People just running around going, I don't know!  Can I say it again?  What is it?  All willy-nilly?  All willy-nilly, running around, they're putting communion wafers in their ears. 
[03:15:30]  They don't know what to do.  Holy water under their arms, they're washing with it.  What's the difference, man?  When my kid got, uh, christened, they had the water from, uh, the River Jordan, and  then he got a rash.  So what the fuck was in the water?  Filthy water.  They drink the wine and they...  Oh, uh, Roland?  Roland?  They drink the wine yesterday, and they pass it around to drink.  Yeah, we said that.  The homeless people there.  Oh, fuck that!  Yeah, man.  I want to drink wine!  And they wiped the...  You're gonna take a sip after that? 
[03:16:00]  And they wiped the, the, the rim of the chalice with the...  Well, the chalice, that was the word.  With the magic towel.  With the magical towel, yeah.  But what about the stuff that falls into the wine?  What about the fucking, yeah, the backwash, as they call it.  Jesus' blood backwash.  Backwash.  Roland?  You're fucking backwash.  We're looking at pictures.  Are you guys, uh, officially tweeting from the, uh, the pizza party?  That's party central right there?  You didn't even clean up the office enough.  It's fine.  Oh, there's the reserved seats. 
[03:16:30]  All right, reserved for Liam.  Who else?  Reserved for Sam and reserved for Kevin.  Kevin gets the nice cushy chair.  You know what I want during this?  No, no.  I, I, I'm, I'm just making one request.  This is all I want.  I can't make it to the party.  Uh, welcome to the party, Richter.  I can't make it to the party.  So, could someone do a pano?  Just a 360 pano, uh, shot on their iPhone?  Something with the pano app?  You know what I never tried to do, by the way?  What?  Can you just keep going in circles and make one huge, like, 720 or 1080 degree fucking picture? 
[03:17:00]  Oh, it'll just look like Fred Flintstone's house.  Yeah, exactly, right.  Where it keeps repeating over and over again.  Oh, that'd be cool.  The same couch and window.  That'd be really funny.  Where are we at with the pizza party?  You ready overall?  Pizza party, pizza party.  Um, yeah, the cake is coming, and so the Diet Dr. Peppers.  The cake is coming?  Mm-hmm.  You mean cookies?  Oh, no, I have a whole cookie plate.  And Diet Dr. Peppers?  Yeah.  What's, oh, that's, that's for people watching their weight.  Is that the only soft drink you're having there?  There's other beverages in the kitchen here. 
[03:17:30]  Like what?  Like Coca-Cola?  Yeah, they have everything.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So you didn't have to buy soda at all.  You could have, you know, your budget.  Gotta worry about your budget.  But he likes Dr. Pepper.  I do.  Oh.  Diet Dr. Pepper.  How many slices of pizza do you think you're gonna have?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm gonna give you for anybody else, probably.  How many do you usually have, if you're honest?  I just only have two.  Two?  Oh, he, he just made a face like, uh, multiply that.  I can act on it large on a good day.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  With tears.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Danny, that's terrible.  No, no, no.  Quick, get rid of it.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  I'm not saying that.  What's wrong with you?  Holy shit.  I said do not say those things. 
[03:18:30]  Oh.  That's everything not to say.  Danny just typed out.  But that's in Quentin somewhere now.  Danny just typed out.  That's somewhere.  Everything not to say.  Holy shit.  That just scared me.  That was horrible.  Whew.  So the pizza party's ready?  Pizza party.  Yeah.  At noon.  And we're following NotSam for just today, so you can tweet a lot of pictures from the  pizza party.  I guess no.  What's Sam's Twitter anyway?  Big Duties, right?  Twitter.com says Big Duties.  Oh, yeah.  And it's I-E-S, not Y-S, dummies. 
[03:19:00]  Peabrain is kind of 1230 because I've been getting texts.  Some meetings have been moved to later.  I have no idea what you just said.  I think he said peanut butter's coming later.  I heard Peabrain?  The people.  Oh, I swear.  I thought he said Peabrain's coming later.  I heard peanut butter and Peabrain.  Wow.  You're right.  Did you ever go to like speech class as a kid or speech?  Was there a problem growing up?  No.  I didn't know. 
[03:19:30]  I love the rolling.  When's Bruce coming back around?  2012.  But the world is ending then.  Shit.  I don't believe the Mayans.  No?  Why not?  Better.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Before Bruce.  Hey, here's the Kathie Lee Hoda clip.  Oh, good.  Let's just listen.  It's quick.  See, that was really...  That segment might have to go away, unfortunately. 
[03:20:00]  What do you mean go away?  To Kathie Lee Hoda.  I don't know.  We were able to talk about Frank Gifford fucking that hooker, trying to fuck that hooker in  the ass.  Oh, shit.  He did this all the time.  He did it again.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  God, I keep...  It's weird how that happens.  Trying not to...  Yeah.  Here's that clip with beeps in it.  First of all, for some reason, I bring a big d*** on the plane.  I wonder what that is.  And it's not too big, because it fits if you just jam it.  It fits.  No one fits.  You have to jam everybody else's d***. 
[03:20:30]  I politely say, whose d*** is this?  And then they say mine.  And I say, would you mind terribly if I just moved it from d*** to d***?  D***, they look at you like venom.  It's first come, first serve.  Okay, wait.  You're the last one on.  So when you get on, there's no room to put your d***, and you have a d*** too, and mine's  hefty.  Needs room.  Here's the thing.  You learn a little discipline in life, and you get rid of the d*** that's in your d***.  I need all the things in there. 
[03:21:00]  That's very fucking funny, man.  We are fucking really good at radio.  I did that.  We are so good at radio.  I sit back, and the magic just happens.  I love that.  Just sprinkle the fucking magic dust around.  Radio cool.  All right, big day for you boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The pizza party is less than two hours away.  I can't wait to hear about it.  Pizza party coverage will, of course, continue.  The pre-show for the pizza party will continue into after Opie and Anthony Live.  Right.  After Opie and Anthony Live, coming up in seconds. 
[03:21:30]  I'm not doing anything for the 10 o'clock hour today.  You know, I mean, you already are.  Oh.  But I feel like I left everything right on the fucking, right on the field.  I have nothing else.  Can I ask you?  Yeah.  It was beautiful.  Can I ask you about how it felt when you sprayed mustard on that guy?  What do you think?  Do you feel guilty?  It was an extra day of Christmas.  It was like fun.  It was the greatest thing ever, especially because I missed the target and hit the China 
[03:22:00]  man.  China man.  All right.  Oh, gosh.  Is that a penis or a thumb?  No.  It's pictures of the pizza party.  What are you talking about?  You see, this is what happens.  Make your choice, people.  Yeah.  Pick wisely which Twitter you follow today for the pizza party.  Okay.  Quite wisely.  Yeah, because, I mean, you guys really don't actually want to see an office pizza party, 
[03:22:30]  do you?  No.  Well, I don't know.  We will be...  Oh, don't configure Windows update.  Don't turn off your computer.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  What's that?  Computer.  We're going to play that mustard spraying clip.  Oh, good.  Haven't heard that in a while.  And we got another This Day in ONA History that we'll be doing.  Oh.  And exclusive pizza party audio. 
[03:23:00]  Lots of fun stuff.  I want to thank Dr. Steve and Dr. Michiukaku, two very good friends, apparently.  I can't wait for March 10th, 2012.  This Day in ONA History.  Why?  The day Sam was fired.  I'm getting fired today?  Wow.  This Day in ONA History.  Wait for it. 
[03:23:30]  March 10th, 2012.  Can I still do the Teddercock show?  Yeah.  Cool.  Hey, man.  It's still...  Hopefully.  Hopefully.  It's definite.  All right.  As long as they don't get fired.  Let's just fizzle out today.  Just fucking hit that.  This is the ONA History Show.  ONA History.  ONA History.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
