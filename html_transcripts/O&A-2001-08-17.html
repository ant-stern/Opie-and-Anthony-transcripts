<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with technical difficulties, requiring engineer Pete Johnson's intervention to fix muddy audio.  The hosts then launched into a furious tirade against negative press from the Boston Herald's Dean Johnson, criticizing their return to Boston and their interview with the Boston Globe. They vowed revenge, specifically targeting their former program director, Dave Dickless, for perceived betrayal, promising to "kick everyone's ass" in Boston.

A large portion of the broadcast focused on the controversy surrounding their "WOW" (Whip Them Out Wednesday) advertising campaign. Westchester County officials had removed their billboards from county buses after a single complaint. Opie and Anthony mocked this decision, highlighting the absurdity of the removal in contrast to other, arguably more offensive, advertisements. They reveled in the resulting media attention from local news and the Associated Press.

The show included a segment detailing a visit to Hooters, a discussion of a Japanese video game called "Boonga Boonga," and concluded with a hilarious anecdote about Blind Matt’s unexpectedly large penis revealed during a lap dance, shared with another blind boxing guest.  Jim Brewer was a guest throughout this portion of the broadcast.

The show continued with Opie revealing he had pink eye. They then discussed Marilyn Manson's arrest for allegedly sexually assaulting a male security guard at a concert.  The alleged assault involved Manson, in a G-string, rubbing himself against the guard, spitting on him, wrapping his legs around him, and rubbing his genitals on the guard's head and neck, allegedly also throwing feces.  Thousands of fans reportedly cheered. This discussion included graphic descriptions and humorous speculation,  a caller recounting a similar incident at Oz Fest, and a fabricated Three's Company-esque scenario involving Manson and a security guard.  A commercial for Stadium Auto Mall interrupted, advertising "no down payment, no security deposit, and no payments until 2002."

Jim Brewer then shared a story about being caught masturbating by his girlfriend while his grandmother slept in the same room, sparking a lengthy, explicit discussion about masturbation involving the hosts and callers. Brewer also promoted his recent appearance on Conan O’Brien.  A call from Jay in Cleveland followed, sharing a story about finding Brewer passed out on his floor, transitioning the conversation to the show's growing popularity in Cleveland.

The show returned to the controversy surrounding the removal of their sexually suggestive ads from Westchester County buses,  with the hosts expressing outrage, likening the situation to McCarthyism. This was followed by a detailed account of a chaotic Hooters party after a recent show, which devolved into a large-scale beer fight involving the hosts, staff, patrons, and even a Fox News crew.  They discussed the numerous ejections, conflicting accounts of the fight's origin, and accusations of inappropriate behavior, including implied sexual harassment and assault.  Angel, a guest, described their experience and escape from an irate woman. Accusations flew regarding producer "Stinky" and the alleged "Sodomizer," with mentions of a "retarded Laverne and Shirley" duo being ejected and a purse being held hostage.  The lack of video footage from Fox was lamented.  Blind Matt’s drunken antics were discussed.

The show included numerous caller accounts of the Hooters incident, a listener recounting directing "FU’s" at their boss, a promotion for "Rat Race," discussion of getting Blind Matt to a van, discussion of the show's airing across various radio stations and their commercial practices, a caller describing picking their nose, a song about domestic abuse, promotion for SummerSlam, and promotion for Jim Brewer’s comedy tour. The "What Did We Learn Today?" segment featured listener calls summarizing the broadcast.

The show also included a segment focusing on their firing (or suspension) from a Boston radio station and their return to WNEW in New York.  Opie and Anthony recounted their experiences, attacking their replacement, Rocko, and Dave Dickless for perceived unprofessionalism and backstabbing. They mocked Rocko’s on-air persona, highlighting fabricated calls, and contrasted their own staged scenarios with Rocko's allegedly disingenuous style. Jim Brewer was again a guest, promoting his rock and roll comedy tour. The show concluded with a Sam Adams beer sponsorship, with Anthony making a joke about the brewer's supposed intoxication. The broadcast was characterized throughout by frequent interruptions, overlapping speech, and highly offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  You can just tell that there was bloody child's underpants in one of their apartments.  Opie were worse than serial killers.  Yeah, well, I don't understand what's so bad about teen guess what's in my pants.  The Opie and Anthony show.  What a show this is.  Hey, we're back with the O&A show.  Guitars from Weezer.  He's in the nut house. 
[00:00:30]  For what reason?  He checked himself into the kook bin.  Yeah, don't look at your headphones like that, Opie.  I'm looking at the same thing.  Someone, why do people screw with stuff in this studio?  It's muddy now, right?  Are you hearing yourself completely muddy?  Yeah, it sucks.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, too.  You're making me yell.  No one out there.  Sounds like crap.  I don't understand, but.  No, because it probably sounds like crap out there, too.  Our voices sound really whacked in our headphones, and it's very distracting.  Then Pete will come in and go, I changed that.  Oh, that's better.  That's it. 
[00:01:00]  That's better.  How's that for you?  You like that?  Yeah.  Nice.  That's better.  Which button are we supposed to have down?  The pre-delay monitor or the one that says this one?  I like this one.  Because when you push the button that says this one, boink.  You get crap off.  You get crap, the mud.  Turn that off.  So you go to this one.  Nice.  Which isn't the one you're supposed to push, because it doesn't say this one on this one.  No, that's much better.  Let Pete Johnson, crack engineer, explain what those buttons do.  Pete Johnson. 
[00:01:30]  I'm just curious.  We won't take too much time with this.  Hi, Pete Johnson.  Hello.  Pete, are we supposed to push down the one that says this one or the one that doesn't say this one?  Pre-delay.  Pre-delay?  Yeah.  So why do we have this one?  Because that used to be this one.  And who pushed that one down?  This one used to be that one.  Oh, but now this one isn't that one.  The one that isn't this one is that one.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, that's perfectly explained.  Right on, Pete.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pete Johnson.  Makes perfect sense.  This one is no longer that one.  I know. 
[00:02:00]  Wow.  Thank God that was fixed.  We learned something right off the bat today on the O&A show.  All right.  We've got to get going with a radio program here.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, we want to hear from you as well.  What?  866-2774.  Wow.  Yes, Anthony?  Was anybody at the Hooters signing last night?  Do we have any people?  I'm hearing from two groups of people.  People that were there and able to stay and people that were there and thrown out. 
[00:02:30]  Seems like a lot of people got thrown out.  Like a lot of people got thrown out.  We'll get into the whole Hooters mess in a little while, Ant.  All right.  Yeah, because it was a lot of fun.  We've got to say hi to everybody that made it down.  We have a bunch of pictures up on opieandanthony.com from last night's festivities.  The picture is kind of boring.  People coming up.  You see a few cans and whatnot.  Yeah, you might get an idea of what was going on.  We'll get into it in a little bit.  But I've got to tell you, man.  Thank God I don't have a shallow ego or anything.  Why is that? 
[00:03:00]  Well, every day we come into work, we go into our office and plunk down on all our desks  is all the negative press for the day for us to read.  With a show like this, bring it on.  Bring it on.  We don't care.  You're just making us bigger.  I enjoy it.  Dean Johnson, you effing tool from the Boston Herald, you piece of crap.  Used to kiss our ass when we were at AF.  What's the problem, dick?  Remember, he was all nice to us when we used to go to events and whatnot.  He'd want exclusive interviews with us. 
[00:03:30]  And now he seems to be a little angry with the program.  He's a guy that kisses AF's ass in Boston.  And he's on AF's side.  Yeah.  And he's a little pissed off that we gave the exclusive that we're coming back to Boston  to Jim Sullivan from the Globe.  So he decides to write a piece of crap article on us today in the Boston Herald.  Well, they've got to choose their sides, Opie.  It's just sad that he'll choose the losing side of AF.  I don't want to bore people to death, but we've been back in Boston maybe a week. 
[00:04:00]  We have no listeners whatsoever.  We have some of our old fans checking in so far, and they're spreading the word.  And we're going to build an audience once again in Boston.  And we will kick everyone's ass in Boston.  There's no doubt in our mind.  Right.  And everyone is seeing way into the fact that we're back in Boston.  They think the station we're on, WBCN, is now changing formats because Anthony and I are on the airwaves.  Hey, it's not like they put...  You stupid douches.  It's not like they put Rush Limbaugh on. 
[00:04:30]  You know?  It's us.  It's us.  We're a rock and roll talk show.  Yeah.  They think we're not going to play any music whatsoever.  They think we're not going to be talking to all the cool bands that are out there now.  You freaking tools.  Just wait and see what we do to you in this stupid city.  Look what we do to you now.  Not that Boston's a stupid city.  I'm just pissed off.  Dean Johnson.  Doesn't even get the characters of the show right.  Awful.  We'll get into that a little bit.  We'll get Dean on the phone if he's brave enough today.  See if we can get Dean on the phone. 
[00:05:00]  Is that Dean on the phone?  Really like to straighten a few things out with him.  Everyone running around scared in Boston because we're back.  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is?  They're trying to fit us into a little category of talk and trying to spin it that way.  This isn't your normal talk show, people.  And Dave Dickless from AF, our old program director that didn't stand up for us and stabbed us in the back when we did the whole mayor's prank.  Yeah.  Ha ha. 
[00:05:30]  You can't use the S word, Opie.  I had to dump out.  He's a piece of S.  He takes out a whole ad in R&R saying, you know, BCN, thanks for the last 33 years.  Good luck with the new format.  The new format.  Ho, ho, ho.  I bet he was just cranking it out to that one.  What a genius I am.  Ho, ho, ho.  It's not a new format, my friend.  Spin it all you like.  I'm going to be kicking your ass, Dickless. 
[00:06:00]  You just watch all the bands that start appearing on our show and playing live.  If you just watch, I can't wait to kick everyone's ass in Boston.  Dave Dickless, who are you going to put in afternoons after Rock Hole just goes down the crapper?  Who are you going to put there?  Hmm.  Are you even going to be there anymore, Dickless?  Hmm.  Hmm, Dave.  What are you going to do?  Take an ad out in the R&R? 
[00:06:30]  Congratulations.  Good luck with the new format.  Ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho.  You got us.  What a great gag.  Ho, ho, ho.  That's almost as good as flying a plane over Fenway to pick Rocko's new sidekick at random.  Another phony thing.  More fake radio.  You'll see.  You'll see.  Hey, come on.  I got to eat.  WBCN in Boston is bigger and better than ever.  Yep.  You just watch what we end up doing.  Here it comes. 
[00:07:00]  You just watch how we keep the heritage at WBCN.  Bunch of tools up there.  Remember, Dave, how you used to giggle like a chick?  I used to giggle like a school bitch when we used to tool on people when we were at your station.  Remember that?  We were doing that for us, for our show, Dave.  Not for you.  And now that we're your enemy, it's going to come back at you.  Remember all that stuff?  Remember how you used to giggle?  Now you'd be in a fetal position in the shower weeping. 
[00:07:30]  I'm already getting reports from Boston that people are coming up to the Rocko and going F-Rocko, F-A-F.  We were the ones that made AF in Boston cool to listen to, and we will make it uncool to listen to.  Simple as that.  Simple as effing that.  And we have an army in place up in Boston.  They're gathering again.  They're starting to realize, holy S, these tools are back on the airwaves in Boston.  Wait until we send up all our boys and girls from New York to the Boston colleges in a couple weeks. 
[00:08:00]  It's going to be a nightmare for you guys.  It's going to be an insane army up there.  So lucky that you tape your phone calls and edit them in clever little ways to make them sound fun by putting fake things in.  Rocko.  So lucky you do that, because if you took live phone calls, you'd be barraged.  You'd be barraged, Frank, Rocko, whatever you're calling yourself.  Frank.  Speaking of Frank, give me a hot dog.  You would sit there and have to take calls.  Ev. 
[00:08:30]  Rocko.  Frank, you suck.  Yeah, shut up.  Back to music.  I don't know what to do.  He'd be dying.  But he tapes the phone calls, and then if they don't go well, he'll edit it and throw in lines and words and comments to the caller that they never heard in the first place.  More phony, fake radio.  So, there you have it.  Yeah!  Spin it all you like, you know.  Thanks for the last 33 years.  Good luck with the new format. 
[00:09:00]  Dave Dickless, you piece of crap.  We have so many surprises for you, you don't even know.  You're going to be weeping in the corner, like Glenn Close from The Big Chill.  Yep.  In the fetal position, sucking your thumb.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  Damn it.  I don't know what to do.  So, just another crappy article on you and I in the Boston Papers today, Anthony.  Never had to deal with us.  We were an ally at one point. 
[00:09:30]  Now we are the enemy, and we will take our fans out of exile and vanquish you.  Vanquish you!  Oh, well, you know, kick your ass in the rain.  Whatever.  Dean Johnson, the Boston Earl today.  BCN is working hard to keep up its faltering music image, even during Opie and Anthony shows.  Last week, there were backstage reports from the OzFest and Rock News reports during breaks.  This is still a rock and roll show, my friends.  Just wait and see. 
[00:10:00]  All right, Ant.  Moving on to the next piece of business in the newspaper.  Yeah, well, this one is going national, my friends.  Yeah, you watch this thing grow into something uncontrollable.  It's already starting to grow.  It started in a Westchester paper.  The Patent Trader.  What the hell is the Patent Trader?  The Patent Trader.  It's a newspaper from where?  North Westchester. 
[00:10:30]  North Westchester.  North Westchester's community newspaper since 1956.  Uh-huh.  And we made the front page of the news, I guess, a couple days back.  Thanks for the heads up, by the way.  A lot of people sent this article in.  It says, shock jocks.  Shock jocks ads whipped off county buses.  You know, I'm going to go around with a cattle prod so that when the reporters say,  are you shock jocks, then you really put like 25,000 volts in their ass?  And go, yeah.  Because I hate that. 
[00:11:00]  Shock jock.  Listen to this.  Bunch of wimps in local government up there in northern Westchester.  Officials removed bus billboards in the wake of a complaint.  One person complained they got rid of all our advertising up in the north Westchester area, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  We have a huge campaign going on, not to bore you, but it's basically our WOW bumper stickers.  And they're on billboards, they're on subway platforms, train stops, back-of-buses, I said. 
[00:11:30]  We even have a three-story by three-story WOW billboard in the middle of Times Square.  Yep.  That you can see on TRL pretty much every day.  How long do you think that's going to be up?  Matter of fact, hold on.  Well, we'll get into it in a second.  Mike, what's up?  Opie, Anthony, what's up?  Hey.  Good morning on a Channel 11 morning news.  The WOW sign in Times Square, clear as day.  I know.  We're going to have that clip on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, the local news, Channel 11 in New York.  They opened up their newscast with a shot of Times Square.  And there, in all its glory, is our huge WOW billboard in the middle of Times Square. 
[00:12:00]  It's pretty cool, man.  Well, you watch what happens starting today, my friend.  Hey, when's Dice coming back on?  Um, sooner than later.  Sooner than later, that's all I can say.  None of your business, okay?  Check out, face.  Hopefully, before we go on vacation, we'll hear from him, okay?  When are you guys going on vacation?  Uh, late next week.  All right.  But we have great, great stuff.  Oh, what, are we going to fake?  A suspension?  No, just going on vacation. 
[00:12:30]  No, no.  We don't fake suspensions on our show.  It really happens.  Isn't that strange?  A whole year goes by.  I never take vacation, but I get a two-week suspension every year.  At the same time.  When it's not the spring or fall book, because the summer book doesn't mean much in the radio world.  Too funny.  So I'll make sure I do my fake suspension in the summer.  Dave, I'm putting in for suspension.  I want to go to Florida.  Fake.  All right. 
[00:13:00]  Officials removed bus billboards in the wake of a complaint.  Forty billboards were pulled from Westchester County B-line buses last week after county officials learned the ads were promoting a raunchy radio team.  Who could that be?  That would be you and I.  Act, act.  How about that?  The advertisements, which featured the word WOW in yellow lettering against a black background, were taken off county buses last Tuesday and Wednesday, according to Lawrence Sally, commissioner of the Westchester County Department of Transportation.  County officials said they were not aware that WOW in the ads stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday. 
[00:13:30]  Who doesn't know that by now?  And as a promotion for the Opie and Anthony show, which airs daily, which airs daily.  All sorts of news stations are taping us right now.  So, great.  I'm going to get to check that out tonight on Channel 5 News, me slurring that word.  Which airs daily on WNEW.  So, listeners apply WOW bumper stickers to their vehicles with the hope that female listeners will see the sticker and bear their breasts.  Yeah, that's one meaning of WOW, right, Anthony? 
[00:14:00]  Another one is people just put the stickers on as support for the show and say, hey, you know, I'm listening.  Yeah, there are a lot of ladies that put WOW in their car and they don't want to see nothing.  They're just supporting the show.  That doesn't mean that there's a lady in this car that's WOWing.  They're just supporting the show.  And it also definitely means Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  We're not going to try to back down and, you know, cower to the man.  Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano received a complaint via email on August 3rd regarding the bus billboards,  according to Donna Green, a spokeswoman for Spano. 
[00:14:30]  The email writer, a woman who said she was offended by the ads, tipped officials off to the meaning of WOW.  The email complaint was forwarded to Sally, who ordered the billboards removed and then turned into the program.  It's hard to read because it's a copy of a copy.  It's not something I would listen to and I wouldn't let my young daughters listen to it.  Yes.  He said, by Wednesday, August 8th, the beeline was WOW free.  WOW free.  Thank God.  Do you know how many lives they saved by pulling WOW? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, that's right.  None.  What?  Thank God the word WOW isn't on the back of a bus.  Is it really that offensive?  That's the question I have today.  Is it really that offensive?  Is the word WOW, it doesn't even say whip them out Wednesday on anything.  Was anyone actually offended when they saw WOW written on a bus board, driving down the road on a bus?  Did you look and go, oh my God, as if you just saw the worst hardcore pornography on the back of a bus? 
[00:15:30]  I'd say no.  One woman email.  One woman emails.  All of a sudden, they go on a frenzy to get all these billboards off the buses.  Yeah.  One woman email.  Bunch of tools up there.  Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This article is sponsored by the National Organization of Women.  No, they got their claws in the middle of this mess.  Yeah.  They got their cat claws in it.  No, this negative press is sponsored by Lifestyles Condoms. 
[00:16:00]  When you're going to get F'd, you might as well use Lifestyles Condoms.  Later, guys.  All right.  Think your rules.  Sally said he inspects each ad placed on beeline buses, but did not realize this one's meaning.  I thought it was, wow, listen to this radio station.  It could mean that.  You know, we did talk to this paper, and they have our quotes.  It's always fun to read, because, you know, when we're doing this on the air, we're just goofing off, and, you know, we don't give a flying ep. 
[00:16:30]  And then when you read it, it's like, ooh, I said that.  Let's see what we said.  In an on-air interview with the patent trader August 9th, the shock jocks were surprised to hear about the county's decision.  They then launched into a tirade against the county for bowing down to groups that have some letterhead and think they have power.  Groups?  I was wrong.  It was bowing down to one person that sent an email.  My God, man.  Yeah, it wasn't even like a campaign.  It was one lady.  No.  It was one lady emailed, said, I'm offended by wow, and that's it. 
[00:17:00]  So I guess if you call up and say you're offended by something else you see on one of these bus boards, they'll just pull it off, right?  Right?  Yeah.  They might as well.  If it offends one person, they've got to just take off all the billboards.  Let's see what else is there.  The duo said this was the first time they have heard complaints about their advertising.  The billboards are common in New York City, said Opie, whose real name is Greg Hughes.  Oh, you got me.  Oh, you got something on me that no one else knows.  Oh, my God. 
[00:17:30]  Print it.  You idiot.  Gotcha.  It's not my real name, you jerk.  Ha-ha.  They didn't get me, did they?  It's my birth name.  I've had this stupid name since I was 12.  Which one?  Greg Hughes?  No.  My parents don't even call me by the name they gave me.  And I don't acknowledge my last name at this time in my career.  You don't?  No.  I don't acknowledge it.  Unlike Prince and Cher, I go by one name. 
[00:18:00]  And Madonna.  Yeah, look, you got that whole thing going.  You've never heard me say Opie Hughes, right?  No.  I don't acknowledge my last name.  And my uncles and aunts and cousins couldn't be happier.  Entree.  Then it says, you can't go a block without seeing a city bus with a wow on it, Hughes said.  We have a wow billboard in the middle of Times Square.  Three stories by three stories.  Who said that, Abbott? 
[00:18:30]  Hughes said it.  I didn't say anything, Abbott.  Look at us being Kreskin here.  It says, Hughes said the incident would generate publicity for their program, which was recently nationally syndicated.  Hughes' partner, Anthony Cumia.  Damn it, he got me.  Damn it, I'm hit.  I thought I got away unscathed by his deep digging reporting of my name.  And you know they did some deep digging reporting to try to find out your last name. 
[00:19:00]  What's his last name?  Oh, it's right here.  Hughes' partner, Anthony Cumia, said there are more pressing issues in the region.  I think there are 20 billion things more offensive on the street than the letters, wow, on the back of a bus.  People know we're all about having fun.  Levy plans to send letters to the station protesting the slogan and will contact other NOW members.  Ah.  Protest all you want.  Your letters go in the garbage.  You know what people do with NOW? 
[00:19:30]  They take a line, you put it by the end, and it turns into, wow, real easy.  I've seen some NOW stickers turned into WOW stickers.  So this is where it gets interesting, my friend.  Yes, it does.  So this appeared a couple days ago.  Mm-hmm.  And we thought it was just kind of going to go away.  Mm-hmm.  Now the Journal News is getting involved.  I haven't even, here, you want to read this one?  I haven't even read this one yet.  This came out today, right?  The Journal News?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, this is in, um...  Another newspaper?  Yeah.  The Journal News.  I guess, I guess it's the competition of the patent trader.  In northern Westchester community.  Ooh, newspaper war.  Westchester County stripped 40 ads off the backs of its beeline buses  after county officials learned they urged women to bare their breasts.  Ooh, the four-foot-by-three-foot ads dominated by the word WOW,  an acronym for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  It's not an acronym.  It just, it's short for it. 
[00:20:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Our promotion for the Opie and Anthony show, which airs daily on WNAW.  Of course, listeners slap WOW bumper stickers on their cars and trucks,  hoping women will flash their breasts as they drive by.  Ellen Flaherty of Yorktown Heights complained about the bus ads via email.  Oh, it puts her name in the paper.  Ellen Flaherty.  Hmm.  Where?  Yorktown Heights.  She complained about the bus ads via email August 3rd, 
[00:21:00]  according to county spokeswoman Donna Green.  She said she was raising two pre-teenage daughters,  insert joke here,  and didn't believe female taxpayers should be encouraged to whip out their breasts.  Female taxpayers?  What does taxpaying have to do with it?  Second woman also complained,  but county officials couldn't locate it.  And do we really encourage people to do this?  We always say, if you feel like it, do it.  If not, whatever.  It's out there.  And we're like, don't harass the ladies.  There's plenty of ladies that'll just do it.  Right. 
[00:21:30]  Because they want to.  Because they feel the power of their boobies.  Look at this.  A second woman also complained,  but county officials couldn't locate her email yesterday.  The complaints were forwarded to County Transportation Commissioner Lauren Sally,  who had never heard the radio show and had no idea what Flaherty meant.  He asked around and found a young male staffer who explained the wow phenomenon.  Could you imagine this going on in the office?  Get that young go-getter Johnson in here. 
[00:22:00]  Get me that young go-getter.  He'll know.  Yes, boss?  What is this wow?  Well, it's whip them out Wednesday, and it's a phenomenon.  You're going to go far, boy.  Like the Daily Planet or something.  Once I checked into it and found out what it meant, I pulled the ads.  Oh.  Sally said.  Doing your job.  Way to go.  Very good.  Very good.  We found it offensive.  I thought it was certainly exploitive of women,  and that's not something that this county will condone. 
[00:22:30]  The ads were history by August 8th.  You know what's weird?  Out of all the ads you see out there, they're worried about the word wow.  You know, I don't care what they put on ads.  I would have a big ad for the F word on the side of a bus.  I could care less.  There are some times that you're driving, you pull up next to a bus and see an ad and go,  holy jeez, like, I'm ready to hit the car in front of me because I'm looking at the girl on this ad.  Right.  Just breasts just about out to the nip point.  What about those jean ads where the girl's on the old car seat, 
[00:23:00]  and it looks like the middle of the desert, and it just basically says, F me?  Yeah, that one was out by the Midtown Tunnel here in New York.  It was a huge billboard of a girl sitting on a car seat, legs apart.  You could see her undies.  The hottest goddamn billboard ever.  But if you're going to be offended by something like wow,  you're certainly going to be offended by that.  They're selling jeans by saying, F this chick.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Bill Hicks has a great bit about that, how to sell soda and stuff,  and how he would have an ad for soda.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And it's a picture of what a lady kind of just like with her hand down near her,  I forget exactly how the bit goes, down near her privates.  Yeah.  And it's very, you know, suggestive and all that,  and all it says in the ad is drink Coke.  Drink Coke.  Anyway, go ahead.  The ads were history by August 8th.  Even without the controversy, they were due to be replaced August 21st. 
[00:24:00]  Cheapos.  Sally tuned in, for curiosity's sake, and then tuned out the shock jocks.  I was not impressed, said Sally, who favors jazz stations.  Oh, darn it.  They were trying to turn you around, Sally.  I thought we'd have him.  She prefers jazz.  No, that's, um, what?  It's a guy, Lawrence Sally.  Oh, Lawrence?  Yeah, that's his last name.  Lawrence Sally's the guy that got the young go-getter to tell him what wow meant.  I would bet money that Lawrence would enjoy, uh, you know, a pair of boobs driving home from his, uh, little job. 
[00:24:30]  Johnson, come in here immediately.  You listen to those guys?  Well, yeah, boss.  I find them funny.  I'm not impressed.  Sit with me.  We're gonna listen to jazz all day.  Okay, boss.  Let's give me a Chuck Mangione block.  I, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
[00:25:00]  Another first for our show.  The county won't lose any money by doing so, Sally said.  It has a $6.5 million three-year advertising contract with Viacom. 
[00:25:30]  The producer of the radio program could not be reached for comment.  What happened, Rick?  You couldn't be reached?  I couldn't be reached.  Interesting.  Unreachable.  Sally said the county had received only one other complaint about an ad.  It was an advertisement for the History Channel.  Had a picture of the founding fathers along with the phrase not found in most children's history books.  An image of Ben Franklin, for instance, was accompanied by the word womanizer.  Of course, we didn't pull that ad.  We had one comment from one person, and there was nothing offensive about it at all. 
[00:26:00]  Okay.  All right.  Get this.  The History Channel puts out an ad.  It's got an image of the founding fathers and says things that most people don't know about the founding fathers.  Ben Franklin, I guess, was a womanizer.  So it had Ben Franklin womanizer.  Watch the History Channel.  Learn more about Ben Franklin.  But somebody called up.  One person said they were offended.  They didn't pull the ad.  Are you trying to say we're more offensive than Ben Franklin?  Being a...  Whoa.  All right.  Hey, Mr. Sally, how do you feel about Socrates? 
[00:26:30]  Whoa.  We're more offensive than Ben Franklin.  Maybe we'll end up on the $10 bill.  All right.  He's an awesome dude.  And a womanizer.  Mr. Ben Franklin.  Great.  But they got one complaint for ours.  One complaint.  One complaint for the womanizing Ben Franklin.  Yeah.  But they pull our ad.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  There you go.  That's it.  His defense for the whole Ben Franklin thing is, well, of course we didn't pull that ad.  We had one comment from one person.  All right.  So, let's comment from one person ours.  All right.  So, follow this.  So, now we're in two local newspapers up there, okay?  Yeah.  This is where it gets interesting.  It has hit the AP wire, Anthony.  The AP.  Which means every media outlet in America has what I'm about to read. 
[00:27:30]  The Associated Press is news aides, pretty much.  It's the one that just spreads out and gives it to everybody.  There it is.  There it is.  No one goes untouched with AP.  And already two stations in New York have read this story from AP.  Both local news stations in New York.  And now what?  We got a call from Fox 5.  Fox 5 taping our first break here.  They're going to be running some of the audio when they report on this tonight on the 10 o'clock news. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  It reads, when wow means more than holy cow.  Coming up on the 10 o'clock news, these signs look harmless.  You know, I love when the news does that, the big tease.  And coming up later, this wow didn't wow people in Westchester as they had to.  We talked with Lawrence Sally and his young go-getter, Mr. Johnson. 
[00:28:30]  What does wow really mean?  We'll tell you.  You've seen them around town.  You've seen them on buses, even in Times Square.  We'll tell you one town that wanted no part of wow.  Wow.  Is there an offensive billboard in your neck of the woods?  Wait, wait.  Why?  I couldn't say that?  No, you can't say that.  At least it doesn't say the C word.  You had to dump out of that?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought I could say that. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  Do you know what your children are reading on the way to school?  It might look harmless enough.  Wow kills.  Anyway, here's the AP story.  When wow means more than holy cow.  Westchester County officials pulled an ad for a radio show from 40 county buses last week.  Once they figured out what it meant, the posters for the Opie and Anthony show on WNAW in New York  were dominated by the word wow and seemed innocent. 
[00:29:30]  But County Transportation Commissioner Lauren Sally says a couple of residents complained.  The commissioner learned that to listeners of the Opie and Anthony show, WOW stands for  Whip Them Out Wednesday and is supposed to urge women to bear their breasts.  Mm-hmm.  Sally says that's offensive and exploitative of women.  Rick Delgado, producer of the radio program, declined to comment.  What did they call you?  Why are they calling you? 
[00:30:00]  Rick.  Last night.  After our Hooters mess?  After?  No, no.  It was just before I got down to Hooters.  I was sending out stuff to a couple of our affiliates.  It's too bad they didn't get us after the Hooters mess.  We would have had a lot of comments.  Yeah.  So now the story is spreading like wildfire all over the place.  And we couldn't be happier.  This is a...  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  This is News 12 in Westchester.  We're calling you guys because all the county officials...  Rob?  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  I didn't hear what you said.  Where are you from?  News 12 in Westchester.  But listen, let me tell you why we're calling you.  Yeah.  We're calling you because all these county officials that go on our air every day  refuse to talk to us about this.  They do.  We're going to you guys.  All right.  And will you be doing a story on this tonight?  Yes, we will.  In between the pet report?  We'll get it on.  I think Rob's their go-getter. 
[00:31:00]  Are you one of their reporters, Rob?  Well, Mr. Sally...  Yeah, I'm a reporter.  Mr. Sally and his young go-getter refused to talk to us.  They did, did they?  Yes, they did.  See, they don't want this blowing up into some big story.  Hey, Rob.  Yeah?  Here's the real deal.  We don't give a flying F what you guys do with this.  Right.  Just make sure when you show the video of the WOW billboard, it's nice and big on the TV screen.  Well, we got it right now on the phone.  It says, Opie and Anthony, a NEW radio host.  And we have the WOW bumper sticker right up on the S screen. 
[00:31:30]  That's it.  And we went out and we got some WOW stickers on cars.  See, this is what's so funny about this type of crap.  Like, you know, the bus sign's all over northern Westchester, okay?  And people check them out.  Not everyone, though.  Okay?  Now, these do-gooders think they're helping out the whole community and they're getting rid of all the WOW billboards, right?  Yep.  It creates a controversy.  Now you've got news organizations and TV stations calling up Opie and Anthony.  And now it's all over their news reports.  What is that doing?  People that never would have known what WOW meant now will read the paper and know what it meant. 
[00:32:00]  They'll watch TV and know what it meant.  So it's better than having the bus signs out there.  These people are stupid.  If you don't like something, just let it go away.  Don't draw attention to it.  You're just making it bigger.  No, they've got to make it look like they're doing the right thing.  That they're being politically correct and defending and helping their constituency.  Of course they are.  We're going to be all over the news tonight, all over the place.  Is this live on TV right now?  This is not live.  No, we're taping it. 
[00:32:30]  Thank God.  I guess a lot of people will be tuning in to your show now.  Of course they will.  Are you going to run this before or after the local farm report?  We don't have a local farm report.  You're taping it on a top-load VCR?  No?  No.  You got all the modern equipment?  Hey, Rob, you know you want to laugh.  Come on.  No, I'm laughing.  I listen to you guys.  All right, good.  Cool.  All right, what else do you need to know, Rob?  I wanted to come down and be on the show, but they said that you guys didn't want to do it. 
[00:33:00]  You want to bring a camera crew and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  God.  It's just, you know what it is?  It's a pain in the ass to do a show when a camera crews are in here.  Right.  You're tight.  Yeah.  Hey, did you type the news tease yet?  I'm not sure.  I think they're just going to run a little piece on it for five, and then we'll have you guys on for, well, maybe we'll have you on for five, too, but then we'll have you on again at ten.  What's the guy going to say?  Wow.  What does it mean?  We'll tell you next.  The big tease.  Well, I think the most interesting thing about the story is what you said before is that one caller complained, and then it was yanked. 
[00:33:30]  One caller.  See that?  What about all the other people in the community that enjoy our show, enjoy the advertising?  True.  And don't find it offensive in any way.  I hate these do-goods.  I think they know what they're doing for everyone else.  Here's my statement, Rob.  Okay.  We are now, we are living in a society that is worse than it was in the McCarthy communist days with communism.  Because if you're perceived as being sexist or racist or homophobic by doing things that you would do on a humorous show like this, all done with caring and love, it's worse than it was in the old days with the communists. 
[00:34:00]  Because you're perceived that way, and people are so scared that by one phone call, you'll pull an entire ad campaign.  Because they're afraid to be lumped in that they are supporting, oh my God, women's breasts. 
[00:34:30]  Eek!  Eek!  And Rob, I don't want to be left out because what Ann said was really, really good.  So if you could just add this at the end for me, just so I'm a part of this.  Sure.  Opie says, your mom's box.  Closing words.  Famous closing words on this show.  What do you guys think about the county officials not knowing what wow meant?  They knew.  They're backpedaling.  They honestly thought that the bus sign said, wow, listen, Topey and Anthony? 
[00:35:00]  That would be some lame campaign that a radio station would run, though, when you think about it.  Wow, listen to these guys.  Three to seven.  Wow!  You know, it is kind of dopey like that.  But, um, they just had to, they had to react to one email.  All right, Rob, we're done with you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There goes Rob.  Now someone's got to, um, watch us on, uh, what?  News 12?  News 12.  Westchester. 
[00:35:30]  Westchester, 5 o'clock.  We'll even run the...  5 and 10.  We'll even run the audio live on our show today at 5, so someone help us out.  There you go.  Set it up nice.  Get, you know, get your phone nice, right next to the TV.  I want to hear the T's and everything.  Yeah, we need the T's and everything.  And coming up...  We're up about Wednesday.  Special investigative report tonight on News 12.  Set your VCRs.  Record it for us, okay?  All right, we have to take a break, Anthony.  We're just getting started.  Right.  Our buddy, our pal Jim Brewer coming in today. 
[00:36:00]  Very funny on Conan last night.  We got to talk about Marilyn Manson.  Maybe we can do that next.  The guy is out of his mind.  And we want to talk about Blind Matt's junk.  Do we have to?  Yeah, because we were laughing really hard in the back office about it.  It's just another example of how God is just a cruel bastard.  We'll get into it next.  Hello, this is Newman.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Don't change the dial.

[00:38:00]  York.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Yeah.  Hoping.  He's got his TV haircut.  TV is my summer haircut, man.  TV haircut.  If I could quickly touch on something West Coast Dave just sent.  Sure.  It's hysterical.  A little link.  We love Japan as Americans.  We love what they're doing over there.  It's always pretty wacky.  You ever see the reality shows over there? 
[00:38:30]  They almost kill each other.  Japs are crazy.  They're crazy.  They have a video game that's a big hit right now over in Japan.  It's called Boonga Boonga.  The player standing in front of this video game console that is shaped like a woman bending  over.  And it's got the rear facing you and a video screen with a little handheld handle device.  The object to cram a plastic finger up a virtual woman's dot steam bear. 
[00:39:00]  The harder you shove, the more reaction you get from the computerized face on the screen.  So you work the finger and the face makes like, makes faces.  That can't be real, is it?  And walking around these games is the mascots.  One is a giant finger.  The other one appears to be dressed with fecal matter. 
[00:39:30]  That's just some of the latest things coming out of Japan these days.  Boonga Boonga Boonga.  Anthony, I have an update on the controversy where we have created.  Started in a tiny little newspaper in Northwest Chester.  Yep.  Our wow advertisements taking off local buses.  Attention, attention, people of West Chester County.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:40:00]  Oh my God, here they come.  Run for your lives.  Run for your lives.  Look out, Dick.  Proceed to the fallout shelters.  Duck and cover.  Duck and cover.  Good Johnny.  The AP picked up on the story?  Yeah.  We're just, you know, rehashing this for people just tuning in.  We just did an exclusive interview with News 12.  Of Northwest Chester County?  O.P., we didn't do an exclusive interview.  We'll do one with anyone.  We don't care.  But Jazz from West Chester writes, 
[00:40:30]  Hey, I remember last year, News 12 ran the same story of a wedding dress store burning down every day for about three months.  Congratulations.  You guys finally made it.  Meaning there's nothing going on at that station.  NHD.  So the local news stations in New York, they've picked up on the story.  They're talking about it.  Channel 5, 10 o'clock news, they're doing something on it.  Channel 9, sending a crew down, they're doing something on it.  Whatever happened to getting high and playing with your yo-yo? 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  Just to spend time.  You just don't want to do it anymore.  You know what I mean?  To waste a little time.  Waste a little time.  Enjoy yourself.  Oh, and this just in it.  Tom Bronco, NBC Nightly News.  Controversy sweeping the New York.  As a whip-em-out Wednesday.  Tom, it's whip-em-out Wednesday. 
[00:41:30]  A whip-em-out Wednesday.  Whip.  Whip.  Offending, uh, well, in the ones of people are offended.  People offended numbering well into the single digits.  And Westchester, though holding steadfast to not taking the billboards down, backed off in a matter of seconds.  Tom Bronco, NBC Nightly News.  I, for one, have not seen any of us. 
[00:42:00]  Even though I do have a wow stick on the back of my limo, limo, limo, limo-zina.  Uh-oh.  Big Continental.  It is on the back of my Big Continental that takes me into work every day.  Here I go.  Let me see if this works.  Katie Couric, show me your fun bag.  Show them to me, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Tom, you seem kind of...  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  Tom, you seem kind of out of it today. 
[00:42:30]  You all right?  I'm quite woozy today.  If you notice on my reports, I'm usually falling asleep.  And I can't pronounce L's.  I did go to your magazine signing at Hooters last night.  I got in a beer fight and I was thrown out of Hooters.  And ended up in a bed in the Park of Meridian watching Spanx Revisions.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  On a related story, blind people, bigger junk, you decide. 
[00:43:00]  As we have blind Matt come in and pull out his junk.  Come on, Al Walker.  Show us your cans.  Let me go to Dennis.  Dennis, what's going on?  Yeah, I just heard the tease on News 12 Westchester.  Yeah.  It says local DJ congratulated Olsen twins.  Yeah, right.  So... 
[00:43:30]  That's all that guy heard.  That's all he heard.  That's all he heard was blah, blah, blah, blah, Olsen twins.  That seems to be what happens.  All right, man.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Stupid Time Magazine.  Hey, get sneaky in here.  We've got to talk about blind Matt's junk.  Blind Matt's junk.  This is definitely going to sound a little gay.  I understand that.  Are we safe?  Yeah, we're pretty safe here.  Let me tell you a little bit about what happened.  We had our blind boxing competition where we had two blind guys come here and just beat the living crap out of each other. 
[00:44:00]  And it was funny because they were just...  He kind of broke his ribs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were punching.  They were punching.  He said his puffy spleen was sticking out.  Puffing through his ribs.  Right.  He was hit so hard.  And a bruised kidney.  But to watch blind people box.  He's got a great story.  Yeah.  And to watch blind people box is just a treat, let me tell you.  So we had them come in yesterday for their special treat for helping us out with blind boxing.  We were going to give them a lap dance, and we did.  Girls from Privilege came down. 
[00:44:30]  Five hot girls, completely naked, just going to town on these guys.  So at one point, blind Matt, who doesn't have eyes, he's got glass eyes.  He pops them out.  Pops them out.  That's a great party trick, man.  He's on the couch.  That's a buzz kill.  Pops the eyes out.  That's a buzz kill.  That's making me go into aliens and everything.  I'd trip harder.  Dude, give me a shotgun through your eye socket.  All right?  No, we could pass through the sinus.  I did science.  He's got no eyes.  Guy knows how to party, though.  He was a trooper last night at Hooters. 
[00:45:00]  Well, you know what happened?  They're laying down on the couch.  So they're sitting on the couch.  The girls are all over them.  They start getting, they're starting to feel the excitement of the...  They saw it first.  That was the big deal.  Well, no, no.  I mean, the guys themselves were starting to get the feeling of excitement about the whole thing.  Gotcha.  You know what I make.  Gotcha.  And now the girls see what's going on with Matt, with blind Matt.  And we just hear him now going, oh, my God, look at that. 
[00:45:30]  He's packing.  And we've seen a lot of strippers.  I've never seen a stripper get truly excited.  They'll fake the excitement and all that crap.  These girls were losing their minds.  They were losing their minds.  They had to pull it out.  They had to pull it out.  He's sitting on the couch.  The blind guy, they pulled his donkey out.  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:00]  So, yeah, this monster falls out.  I mean, we all saw it.  It was right there.  Do we have audio of exactly when it happened?  And, yeah, we do.  All right.  Wow, that is a monster.  How about that? 
[00:46:30]  God, Jenna, always funny.  So, we're talking in the back office, and we're saying, how cruel can God be?  Here's a guy, he's blind, and he's packing a monster, and he has no effing clue, because  he has nothing to compare it to.  He has no idea how big his junk is.  The only way.  We should have him describe what is something.  Yeah, what does he think of, man?  The only way he could judge other guys' size is to grab it.  And he hasn't done that.  So, he doesn't know.  He thinks he's sporting like the average, I guess. 
[00:47:00]  He thinks everyone has a monster.  Everyone's sporting this, right?  Everyone's sporting this one, right?  Hey, guys, what about this?  What do we do with this?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Is that your third leg?  Yes.  With a chick, you know, it's like, I'm blind, and I'm not sure if I'm inadequate here or  not, and just, the proverbial sound that a sack of potatoes makes when you drop it on  the floor.  This should be okay.  I hope it's not too inadequate. 
[00:47:30]  I think we were just overtired from looters, because we were laughing our asses off in  the back office.  We're like, it's too funny how cruel this is.  But when he plays with his yo-yo, what I'm saying, we have visual, and we, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What does he think of?  I guess he's thinking of what it feels like.  Like, you know, the feeling of a chick.  I don't know.  I don't know what blind people that I've never seen before fantasize about when they  jake.  You know?  Yeah, they're cranking it.  He had the snicker bar in his pocket right away.  Like, you know, the movie theater size. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Before they even got naked, he was already.  The movie size.  Is that a huge one they have?  King size.  Yeah, and then one of the dancers was so hot on this, she jumps on him and just starts  gyrating.  Like crazy.  She lost it.  Completely lost it.  It was a carnival ride.  There he is.  Why Matt?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  You guys are awesome.  You're killing me over here. 
[00:48:30]  Well, you're the guy with the huge junk.  You got a monster in your pants.  We just want to know, do you know that?  And how would you know that?  I've only heard the screams.  That's how I was doing.  Yeah?  Is it, um...  So women have told you, right?  I've heard that, yeah.  All right.  But you don't know what other guy's size is, right?  No, absolutely no.  Yeah, because you'd have to grab on.  Absolutely.  That's a definite negative on that one.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it's just funny to hear this.  I mean, I didn't realize the whole, you know, being caught up in the moment. 
[00:49:00]  I really didn't realize.  Yeah.  The whole damn thing just fell out of your pants.  You guys are too much, man.  Too much.  You getting home all right last night?  Oh, yeah, dude.  What a funny...  We got on, like, a certain train, and, like, my buddy and I both passed out.  We missed our connection train in Babylon.  Matt was so hammered, he could see.  Exactly.  My eyes were bloodshot this morning.  Does your dog, like, treat you differently when you just get hammered? 
[00:49:30]  Like, oh, I've got to deal with a really drunk guy tonight.  No, I'll tell you, too.  Like, his guide dog's all pissed.  That's funny.  Oh, you idiot.  It's like, oh, God.  Come on, man.  Man, he's staggering behind me.  He's not keeping up.  I'll be nice to him, but that last step into the house, I'm not going to alert him to that.  You could fall right on your face, funny man.  I'll tell you, though.  Every five years.  It's actually, it's a benefit because, you know, the dog has a good memory. 
[00:50:00]  So, like, when I used to live in the city, my first dog used to get me home, and I'd wake up in the morning, like, how did I get here?  Oh, you dog knocked on that again.  I thought a good memory, he'd tell you what you did last night.  Well, that, too.  Remember that chick?  Oh.  The two of yous have piles of crap right next to each other.  What a night, huh?  Where'd that come from, man?  What a night.  But, man, I had a great time at Hooters, man.  You guys are a blast.  Oh, cool.  Hold on a second.  Mary wants to say hi.  Mary.  Yeah.  You're on with Blind Matt.  Hey, I didn't hear yesterday's show, and I wanted to tell you guys I wanted Blind Matt's number now. 
[00:50:30]  Oh.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  You like large mules?  I don't care what anybody says.  Size definitely matters.  Ah, there you go.  See all you little sweet guys?  But you have to be woman enough to handle it, you know.  That's true.  Believe me.  I've heard, uh, I've heard that.  Really?  You ever bottom out?  Uh, yes.  You bottom out.  Really? 
[00:51:00]  It's like taking the old Chevy Nova over the whoop-dee-doo, man.  Those shots ain't gonna handle it.  You know what I mean?  Bam, ow!  That is funny you say that.  I've never heard that bottom out.  There was a girl in Buffalo.  I hit the back wall.  You bottom out?  There you go.  I'm like, wait a minute.  You hear a little squeal from her, and then you get that heebie-jeebie feeling like,  what did I just hit?  What did I just hit?  Uh, Howard's on line four, who, who, who.  Let's, he wants to talk to Blind Matt.  Howard.  Yeah, I had a question for Blind Matt. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, Blind Matt.  You?  Yeah, I was wondering if you, I'd trade my eyesight for your junk.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  No, I'm happy as is.  All right.  Hoo-hoo.  We got a bunch of idiots that listen to us.  I couldn't be happier.  All right, Matt.  Thanks, guys, and we'll see you soon, man.  See you soon?  Amazing.  How about that?  I didn't even realize that.  You're a blind guy humor.  Are you holding the phone with your junk right now, man?  Wrapped around twice.  Like a python. 
[00:52:00]  Did you make it into work today?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  At what time?  Normal time.  Oh, man.  Five o'clock.  Do you have different glass eyes that are blood shots, and when you're hungover, you  just pop those in, just so everyone knows how you're feeling?  No.  Wouldn't that be great?  You pop in, you're there.  Or just occasionally, you pop in a pink eye one and go, no, don't come here.  I could.  Got conjunctivitis.  I could turn them both white.  Not the pink eye.  Kind of like.  No.  Go with the big ones that look like cat's eyes.  You go, no, I'm a vampire.  I don't know what happened.  Kind of like the guy that has the two different toupees, and he wants everyone to think that he just 
[00:52:30]  got a haircut.  He's got a haircut.  He's got the long one and the short one, man.  Sure.  And then one day he'll just come in with the short one, and be like, hey, Bob, you get  a haircut?  Yeah.  That's clever.  And they switch back to the long toupee when they go on vacation, hoping that, you know,  well, a week went by, sure, he could have grown out that much.  That's almost as good as one of them old dirty schemes or angel schemes.  Hey, Matt, do you have one blue one and one brown one like a mongrel dog?  No, but I used to, you know, when I was growing up, you know, your head grows, so you 
[00:53:00]  have to get new eyes, you know, from time to time.  So I used to have like hazel kind of like Joe Namath color kind of eyes, but now I went  back to my natural brown.  Natural brown?  Yeah, natural.  Natural brown.  You know what I was born with.  Right.  It was good, though.  He could fall asleep anywhere and no one would know it.  Except for the jaw hanging open and the drool on the collar, but other than that, yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Matt.  Thank you, guys.  I get lenses that look like. 
[00:53:30]  I did, man.  You guys suck and we'll see you soon.  I get lenses that look like the old comic book x-ray specs.  That was.  And walk around looking at girls going, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the spirals.  Remember the little x-ray specs?  We see blue clothes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  X-ray specs.  There we go.  It's playing, Matt.  Bottom of the eye.  A red eye.  A red eye.  Keep away, man.  Watch it, man.  I got the pink eye.  You don't want to get near this.  Yeah, it sucks.  I'm a horse. 
[00:54:00]  Freaking whore.  Doug from Springfield doesn't know what bottoming out is?  Please.  We don't even have to explain it.  Yeah, I think everyone knows what bottoming out is.  If you don't, Doug, ha-ha.  Because there's only one reason you don't know what it is.  Can't reach.  Here he is.  We should take a break, huh?  All right.  We got to get into Marilyn Manson. 
[00:54:30]  Well, don't put it that way.  Well, true.  He tried to get into somebody.  Oh, we'll get into it next.  You haven't heard what Marilyn Manson is accused of doing?  No.  I passed him once.  I actually met that dude.  Yeah, we saw him backstage up in Boston.  And the guy is like, he's all business.  Yeah.  He's the business guy.  How you doing?  He knows the deal.  But then he gets out on stage.  And now he's up on sexual assault charges.  And just wait to hear what he did, man. 
[00:55:00]  It's going to be great.  And are you going to tell your story today, Jim?  You are.  I'm just saying.  He told me on the phone he would tell his story.  I'm just asking.  We'll try to get to it.  Sure.  Okay, good.  Hello.  O.P. and X.  The one is funny.  The one is six.  I hated my grandma.  Bitch, you precious this.  Stadium Auto Mall.  Stadium Auto Mall.

[00:56:30]  I'm going to wear glasses.  And we're back with the O&A show.  I can't believe Brewer didn't hear what Marilyn Manson did.  Let me hear this.  Let me hear this.  I, I, I.  Classic.  All right, let me read it.  Let me read from the newspaper.  Marilyn Manson in concert interlude.  He's up on charges. 
[00:57:00]  Sorry, Anthony.  Yes.  Satanic shock rocker Marilyn Manson yesterday was charged with sexually assaulting a male security guard during one of his concerts.  What a shocker.  I'm shocked.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  He has.  He's, he's, he goes that way?  Who knows?  Oh, my God.  This is nuts.  Shocking.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got to hear the rest.  I got to hear the rest.  I got to hear the rest.  This is crazy.  Assaulting a male security guard during one of his concerts in what prosecutors call the disgusting display of perversion. 
[00:57:30]  So, it's a male security guard.  Wait, a male security guard, but what did he do?  He's going to die.  The outrageous singer, dressed in a G-string, first approached Joshua from behind while rubbing his own area.  That's right.  So, he's rubbing his donkey.  Right.  Walking toward the security guard in his G-string.  Conjures up some image right there.  As the theme Jaws goes on. 
[00:58:00]  He's trying to do his job.  I'm back for a topper.  You, stand back.  Back up.  So, he's, he's, he's, he's, walking toward the security guy, rubbing his own junk, okay?  Then he spit on the guy's head.  Spit on his head.  Oh, that old gag.  Isn't that a good one?  Spit on his head.  Oh, where am I? 
[00:58:30]  Then he spit on, okay, his head.  Wrapped his leg.  Wrapped his legs around the guard's body.  And rubbed his flank area.  His, his, oh, he, wait, he gave the guard a reach around?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  So, he spit on the guy's head.  Spits on his head.  Wrapped his legs around the guard's body.  And rubbed his junk.  Yeah.  On the guy's head and neck.  Oh, oh, okay.  Oh.  Oh.  He gives him a little prison lube. 
[00:59:00]  This guy literally is one gene from a monkey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He was humping the guy's head.  And then what he did, he did crap on the floor and throw his feces.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Prison lube, it's called.  Oh, man.  You know, when you give him the old, uh.  So he jumped.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Calm down, Marco.  That's some serious.  Whew.  Uh.  The incident was witnessed by thousands of wild-eyed Manson fans in Michigan who cheered in delight. 
[00:59:30]  Hey.  Assuming it was just another part of the bizarro musician's provocative act.  Manson, a.k.a. 32-year-old Brian Warner, was charged with criminal sexual conduct and assault and battery.  God bless America.  Can you believe that?  He spits on his head and starts rubbing his junk in the spit on the back of his head and his neck.  Get that wow sign off the bus now! 
[01:00:00]  Now?  Where you going, sweetheart?  Going to see Marilyn Manson, ma.  Well, have a good time.  Get that wow sign off that goddamn bus now!  And stop throwing rocks at my car, you little crapper.  I know you're.  That's what they probably said.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Okay.  Um.  The prosecutor said the July 30th assault at this, uh, theater far exceeded any freedom of expression or artistic license. 
[01:00:30]  No.  No S.  When another man is rubbing his junk on your head and neck using his own spit as lubricant.  I should have auditioned.  I should have auditioned Sinai Live like that.  Yeah.  Jim, you're next.  Hey, Lauren.  Ooh.  Get his donkey out of my head.  What are you doing, Jim?  That is sick, man. 
[01:01:00]  How about a hot pocket?  It's a great way to get a job, though.  We need a stock boy.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Security guard.  So, this guy must have, uh, he must be filing some kind of a lawsuit, I'm sure.  Ah, yeah.  How do you do that?  That's worth at least 30 mil.  And then, of course, uh, according to the paper, Marilyn Manson could spend the rest of his life in jail.  Yeah.  I hate when they had that.  I don't think in this case, but like, uh, 10 years in jail.  I know. 
[01:01:30]  The Sopranos child, he may be booked away for 30 years.  Yeah.  He could draw a 30-year jail sentence from this, or just public service for 100 hours.  How funny, Marilyn Manson trying to give this guy the Roman war helmet.  The Roman war helmet?  Do you think he was trying to give him the Roman war helmet?  That's exactly what he was doing.  What a great move.  Hey, it was up, uh, in the head and neck region.  He was doing, he was going for the helmet.  I was injured about my head and neck.  It would have been...  All over my neck.  He comes walking out on the stage. 
[01:02:00]  Dun-dun-dun-dun!  Dun-dun!  It's a great opening, man.  War helmet.  Uh, Andrew.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, Brewer, don't laugh.  That's the same thing that happened to you when you got the massage.  Don't you love how the listeners forget?  I got mad for a quarter of a second, but damn, that was funny.  They never forget.  It's great.  Yeah.  The massage episode.  See, that's what keeps you normal.  All right.  Man, friends say man, sir.  What's happening to you when you're a massage?  Good.  Same thing.  What, line seven? 
[01:02:30]  Uh, which line here?  Uh...  Over here?  Okay.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Listen, my friend went to the concert last week, to the Oz Fest, and he did the exact  same thing.  Ooh.  And my friend said it was definitely part of the show.  Ah.  He said it was the guard just stood there, staring straight ahead, and he was all into it at  the Oz Fest, over here.  Oh, so it's like some kind of a bit for the, uh...  Part of the show, but I mean, maybe this guard didn't like it too much. 
[01:03:00]  No, I was thinking what you were saying, maybe the guard is part of the show.  He maybe did the wrong guard.  Maybe he did the wrong guard.  He did the wrong guard.  Maybe.  What's he doing?  What's he doing?  The brewer.  Yeah?  Brewer.  What?  Later, faggot.  That's disgusting.  Bad Three's Company episode, where somebody is supposed to be somewhere, and they don't show  up, and tonight on Three's Company, Jack is standing in as security guard for the...  Marilyn Manson gives the Roman candle to the wrong security guard. 
[01:03:30]  Wah, wah.  Laugh along as Jack Tripper poses as the security guard.  Yeah, what was his friend's name?  Remember the...  The swinger guy?  Larry.  Larry, that's right.  Larry, trying to make some extra money with Marilyn Manson, agreed to be a security  guard that Marilyn Manson would hump with his own spit, but he couldn't make it because  he got a hot date with some real old woman that seemed to be every woman on that show  that they were going out with.  Hey, hey. 
[01:04:00]  Here we go.  Join us tonight for Three's Company when Jack Tripper gets humped by Marilyn Manson.  Come and spit on my head.  Larry couldn't make it.  He's busy banging Mr. Furley.  Look what I did to you again.  Laughs ensue as Jack gets raped by the entire band. 
[01:04:30]  Watch Pat Smear's money shot.  Kidney punches all around.  And it all finishes off as Mrs. Roper gets the Roman War helmet in her moo-moo.  And she finally gets what she was asking for.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, sure.  There you have it.  Let's go to Cleveland.  Tim, what's up today? 
[01:05:00]  Hey, O&A, man.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  I want to ask Brewer.  First of all, Brewer, man, you were hilarious last night on Conan.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah.  F. John Goodman, F. Spanish Sesame Street.  And we're going out to support Jay either tonight or tomorrow night.  Very fun.  And I was wondering when you're coming to Cleveland.  Sometime September, October, something like that?  Check the websites, www.jimbrewer.com.  But no one knows how to spell Brewer.  B-R-E-U-E-R. 
[01:05:30]  B-R-E-U-E-R.  All right, F. Dave the Jew.  All right, Tim, thanks.  The Jew.  F. Dave the Jew.  Oh, okay.  Never floats your boat there, pally.  Um, Jim.  What?  You have to tell your story.  Well, I felt bad for you.  Well, I was listening to you the other day.  You have no problem telling it?  No.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I was listening to you the other day.  I was driving my wife.  But we also had grandma in the car.  Oh, no.  So we all headed down to the Regal Beagle. 
[01:06:00]  Marilyn Manson.  B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B.  Me and Dee are howling.  And so Opie's like, yeah, and I got caught playing.  And she went back to sleep.  And I'm howling because I've been caught many times.  Ooh.  Yeah, Opie got caught recently spanking it by his girlfriend.  We rented Rush Hour because I never saw him when it was in theaters.  But I couldn't call in.  I couldn't call in.  And, uh, well, I'll just refresh everyone's memory because I, at least I have someone on 
[01:06:30]  my side.  Come on.  Every guy has.  Yeah, but no one around here would admit it.  Every guy has.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I've never been caught.  You are being sexually harassed from the moment you wake up in the morning by your chick.  I swear to you, I've never been caught.  Brewer, this is the third time for me.  Oh, it's been at least three.  It always causes big fights.  She flips out.  Really?  And I thought she was mad.  I thought she was asleep because I looked, you know, you start with, like, you start slowly,  you know what I mean?  And then you're like, well, I've got to get some friction going.  Well, what happened?  So I turned around because she's on the couch. 
[01:07:00]  I've got to get some friction going.  Well, at first I was like, whoa, hey, look at this.  This feels nice, you know?  That old cartoon.  And then.  So at first you could be in the mode like, I don't want to be bothered.  It's too much work, maybe.  And then the second you're getting into it, it's like, why am I not doing this all the time?  Why am I not quitting my job and doing this full time?  So when it really started, you know, I started getting into her, I looked behind me to make 
[01:07:30]  sure, you know, she's still asleep.  And she was asleep.  But would you give her a little peek?  Would you give her the fish eye?  Oh, yeah.  I turned around.  Exactly.  Hold me with the fish eye.  Oh, wait a minute.  You got to understand.  She was two feet.  She was two feet behind me.  You're very quiet.  You get the quiet method.  And now I got.  You're quiet.  Just the thumb movement.  You get the real quiet method.  Just the thumb movement.  Just maybe like the inside right here, like the wrist area.  Yeah.  Thumb movement, light movement, and pressure with the pinky, ring, and middle finger. 
[01:08:00]  So then I adjust the pillow.  I'm getting all set.  And I look behind me.  I'm like, all right, she's still asleep.  And now it's time to get down to business.  I guess I was shaking the whole room because she woke up.  Well, you know what happens?  No joke.  Because we have, like, all these stupid things in my living room.  And some of the crap is shaking.  Well, what happens in this situation, it's sort of like going, you know, when you start  drinking, you don't realize you're drinking, having a good time.  So you start talking like this.  Yo, I got to take a beat.  You see the Mets?  Why would you bring in a beat? 
[01:08:30]  He sucks.  He sucks.  So when you start getting into that thing, it takes over.  You're getting into the zone.  You don't realize you're doing it right here.  Yeah.  So, Sandy, we got on the air the other day.  That's Chris Rock, by the way, that talks about the nobody's home jerk.  What does he say?  What does he say?  You get in the good nobody's home jerk.  Well, you know what's home.  You can go to town.  You can go to town.  You can do whatever you want in whatever room. 
[01:09:00]  You can do the roast beef.  Oh, yeah.  It don't matter.  So, uh...  Nobody's home jerk.  So it turns out...  Everybody's home.  Here's nobody.  Scream if you want to.  You can play out of dinner.  It's that dark.  I don't care, because nobody's home.  It's just me and the dog. 
[01:09:30]  Nobody's home jerk.  So, uh...  That is a good jerk.  When nobody's home.  The nobody's home jerk.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I've been shaking in the bed like a crackhead.  But it's okay, because nobody's home.  I've been putting pillows together, making it look like an ass. 
[01:10:00]  And I've been doing the home jerk.  I've been banging.  I've put up other pillows, make them watch.  Say, you're next.  I've been putting a shatting pillow on a jerk.  I use every room in the house.  I don't care.  No one's home.  I'm doing it in front of the fridge.  On my donkey.  I'm going to get in a donkey bottle of kind of jerk. 
[01:10:30]  I'm doing it in front of the TV.  I'm doing it in front of the fridge.  I got pillows and how they is other than hungry.  Nobody a home jerk.  All right.  Joe Rogan.  You ever hear that, dude?  Yeah.  He has a bit where he goes, the worst part about when you're playing, when you're doing the donkey, 
[01:11:00]  is you're going to play.  And always when you finish, it's always like, what's wrong with me?  So what happened?  Nice head, dude.  Make a long story short.  I thought I was safe and, you know, did the thing.  It turns out when we got standing on the air, because she, I thought she caught me, but we 
[01:11:30]  didn't really want to talk about it around the house.  That's what you're talking about.  So I figured I'd bring it up on the air where, you know, it's a little safer to discuss things  openly.  And it turns out that she did open up her eyes during the whole thing, and she was scared  at what she was seeing, so she made believe she was sleeping for the rest of it.  So she has to sit there and make believe you're sleeping.  Good for her.  What to do?  What to do?  Hold on.  Jay wants in here.  He's in Cleveland tonight. 
[01:12:00]  We're going to get to your story, my friend.  Jay, what's up?  What's up?  I just heard Jim Brewer giggling.  That's what's up.  That's a party.  What's up, Jay?  What's up, Brewer?  When are we going out together, Hammer?  Soon.  I'm in Cleveland.  Your name on the answering machine said Jim Brewer.  I swear to God, I tore them a new a-hole.  It said Jim Brewer and John Tenet coming up.  Jay, one time, I was staying at his house in L.A. years ago, and we're hanging out.  I went to sleep early. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, no.  Do I need, in Jay's house, do I even need to say any more?  And this is when I wake up, you know when you're in that stress, you know, I'm leaving  home, and I'm in L.A., am I going to be on TV, am I going to be on movies?  Jay's like, Brewer, last time, we're going to hell, Brewer?  No.  No, Jay, whatever.  Faggot.  You know, sit home, be a faggot.  All of a sudden, I'm passed out in a coma, and all of a sudden, I wake up to this thing  standing directly above me in dark. 
[01:13:00]  It's like four in the morning.  Sergeant Brewer, what are you doing lying on my floor?  Dude, I can't even tell you.  That was the most bugged out thing I've ever had to.  Jay.  Private Brewer.  What is your major malfunction, Private Brewer?  Jay, what the F, man?  What are you doing?  You just got it home.  What's going on?  Who's Jay, soldier?  You must be drop your C and grab your socks, screaming about a man named Jay. 
[01:13:30]  You too rock.  Keith Robinson was there.  You too rock.  That's right.  That's right.  Get off you and your butt, friend.  I want everything to clean, Brewer.  Brewer.  I'm going to like a drill sergeant who will just read your name tag and kill you.  I didn't know if he was going to pop me.  No, I was just doing the guy from Full Metal Jackets.  Did you go out?  Did you go out?  No, me.  I was half in a coma.  No, I was just playing PlayStation, drinking beers and drinking scotch.  Jay got a good jerk on.  I got to tell you guys this. 
[01:14:00]  And Brewer, this is good for you too, buddy.  What's that?  What's that?  When I say five, I mean like five people last night at one restaurant said, listen to you  on O&A all the time.  When are they coming here?  Cole, Cleveland, some love.  You guys are blowing up.  Dina Cola mentioned Jim Rome when he went on stage and they cheered.  And he goes, how about Opie and Anthony?  And I was out of the showroom and I thought, I was like, Dina Cola doesn't get laughs like  that.  Oh, that hurts. 
[01:14:30]  The place erupted.  They're going, hey, I heard about the Philly Summit.  When are they going to do it here?  When are they going to do it here?  They are rabid for you guys.  Yeah, we're feeling it from Cleveland, man.  It's cool.  This morning I did radio.  Anyone's asking me, the only thing anybody wanted to talk about was the guy's blind lap  pants.  I'm like, money.  I wasn't there.  What do you want me to tell you?  He's blind.  He's got a monster in his pants.  Oh, Jay.  It's like a Jay Moore career.  What was the line?  Oh, I'm there, but you kind of really don't notice it. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  And people always come up to me like they're letting me know that someone clowned me and  it's like inside information.  I don't know if you know this, but somebody said it.  I was like, oh, that's funny.  Yeah, of course.  It's not the reaction they expected.  Just showing the love.  It's the best.  The only reason I called is I cannot believe how huge you are in such a short amount of  time.  It's only been like four weeks there, I think.  Dude, four weeks, more weeks.  This town is ready for you to rock its age.  Yeah, we'll get out there, man.  We're going to do something.  I mean, I'm talking sooner than later. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  We'll plan something in the fall then, man.  And if you got extra time during the breaks, Serena Williams playing Barbara Shett in this  and I already put like two maps of Hawaii into my carpet.  Serena Williams.  You know how I like McElroy used to put the ball in his pocket?  Yeah.  They're just sticking under their panties up against their ass cheek.  Oh, I know.  Everybody know I'm watching.  We love that.  Especially Serena, that dirty girl that needs me.  How hot would Serena be with that big ice cream scoop of booty and the father abused  her just enough to make the sex wild? 
[01:16:00]  That's the kind of girl she'd be going on you and then she'd just look you in the eye  just making sure she's doing the right thing by Papa.  Oh, God damn, you're sick.  I'm sick, but I haven't lied yet, as Red Fox said.  Now, Serena's a good jerk.  Not yet.  Where are you playing this weekend?  I'm not playing until September.  I don't start until September 5th.  Are you still filming?  Long Island.  Yeah, man.  Oh, awesome.  Hey, Jay, a bunch of people are calling saying I'm going to a Jay show tonight.

That's the only reason you want to plug.  I just called to let you...  Don't forget how this started.  I'm doing recon for you guys.  But I'm asking you, where are you playing?  I'm at the Improv.  For the rest of the weekend.  All right, dude, we've got to take a break.  If you want to call it back.  Geez, how many times are you going to plug, Jay?  All right, man.  Hey, private brever!

I got to tell you, we all ordered some Italian food today from, you know, someone close by  to the station.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, I got to tell you, not very happy.  Yeah.  But it was pretty tough to get a hold of Joey and get them to send stuff up from Little  Italy.  Well, next time, we'll just do that.  We will call Paisano.  I don't know. 
[01:18:00]  He delivered for us.  I don't think he does that, though.  You got to go down there.  And why not want to go down there?  It's right there in the heart of Little Italy, all the romance of Italy.  It's warm, friendly.  It's a relaxed restaurant.  They serve incredible, authentic Italian cuisine made from old world recipes and priced  right.  And the portions are huge, so you take some home with you.  And they have incredible pasta lunch specials.  So it's not just for dinner.  You ask for Joey, the owner, and you get a glass of wine in the house.  Speaking of wine, Paisano's got a great wine list.  So check them out.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.

All owned by Inquinity Broadcasting.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  Hey.  Friday.  Hey.  Friday. 
[01:19:00]  Hey.  Friday.  Hey, hey.  This is the O&A show.  Hey, hey, hey.  Jim Brewer sitting in today.  He killed on Conan O'Brien last night.  Yes.  Have you heard that with Carolyn Ray was on before you?  Yeah.  And like Conan was.  Boy, I think Conan was a little taken with her.  Well, she was showing her cannons, man. 
[01:19:30]  She had two.  She has huge guns.  Cannons.  Yeah.  For there's a bomb to rock.  Those type of cannons.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of them, like, flew out.  Oh, it was incredible.  And I think Conan was a little taken with that.  Who was?  That's disgusting.  Yes, Marco finds those disgusting.  Get that sticker off the bus now.  This is an outrage.  Yeah, she was packing.  She had that red thing.  She's cute. 
[01:20:00]  You know what?  I remember her from years of doing stand-up.  Yeah.  She's funny, too.  You know what?  She's a little punchy.  Wow.  Hold on.  I got to go to this guy real fast.  Chris.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's going on, O?  You tell me.  I'm waiting for it to come on.  They just, like, showed when they started up the news program.  Yeah.  County goose when sexual ads are placed on county buses.  What?  This is the News 12 report they're doing in Northwest Chester.  Oh, is that what it is?  I'm still waiting for it.  I'm still hearing about this fire they were talking about before.  So what was the tease? 
[01:20:30]  What was the tease?  Yeah.  They were saying, now, West Chester County goofs by playing sexually explicit ads on county  buses.  Goofs?  Yeah.  Goofs.  Goofs.  Oh, hoops.  You guys are goofy.  Hey, could you just record it?  Because we're going to talk about something, and then we'll go back to you.  I don't have a recorder with me.  Damn you!  Damn me.  Are they going to do the story next, you think?  I'm just waiting.  You're a goof.  Oh, we can record here.  Yeah.  Of course.  Oh, look at us being there. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  Oh, hold on.  All right.  Turn it up.  You have been pulled from 40 West Chester County buses following a single complaint.  WOW ads, similar to this bumper sticker, have been taken off the backs of the county beeline  buses.  WOW stands for Whistle Now Wednesday, a WNW advertising campaign, which urges women to expose their breath.  Now, radio personalities, Opie and Anthony, 12 West Chester, live on their program today.  DJ Anthony referred to the county's decision to pull the ads as censorship. 
[01:21:30]  You're living in a society that is worse than it was in the McCarthy communist days.  Because if you're perceived as being sexist or racist or homophobic by doing things that  you would do on a humorous show like this, all done with caring and love, it's worse than  it was in the old days. 
[01:22:00]  While county officials refuse to comment on their decision to pull the ads off the buses,  we, of course, will have more on this story, also on the News 12 Night Edition, beginning  at 10.  And, you should have ended with a bunch of dicks.  That's not what I was going to say.  You should have said, now, get out of my way, dick, dick.  I figured I'd have cut that part out.  That's so funny.  I love it.  You know what?  You know what?  I got to tell you something.  That's true.  I do that on purpose because I try.  It's like, oh, yeah, it's just like the McCarthy communist thing in a nice way. 
[01:22:30]  They bought that.  Brewer, I go, you know, I made a really good point.  I want to make sure I'm part of this piece tonight, so could you add your mom's box for  me?  You know what I'm going to do?  Let's, Opie, we got to have a contest.  Who could get the dumbest quote on these news shows?  Well, I'm in the lead.  This is like communism.  It's the goddamn commies.  These seven bitches started coming in years ago, and I told you to open up your peepers, 
[01:23:00]  hot shot.  It's the goddamn Red Menace is what it is.  First, it was the Mexicans.  All right, guys, I got to run.  Hold on, Chris.  We're going to give you Jim Brewer's tickets, okay?  Cool.  For what show, Ben?  Vanderbilt.  Vanderbilt, Long Island?  Yeah, when is that date?  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  I think it's in September.  September 5th?  That's the first night.  Yeah, September 5th at the Vanderbilt and Long Island.  Chris, you got some tickets.  Stay there.  We'll get your info.  That is hysterical. 
[01:23:30]  That is great.  If you're like a fan of the show, because we were goofing when we were seeing all that  crap to the reporter, and then they reported on their newscast as really serious.  Because I said before, I have a serious statement to make.  Here's my statement.  It is worse than communism.  Communism.  They're taking dopey wow things off the back of Buzzers, and I'm equating it with the McCarthy  era communist witch hunts.  I'm going to start watching TV again.  It's so funny.  This is interactive television for us. 
[01:24:00]  Well, we're going to be on Fox 10 o'clock news.  Channel 9's coming down here.  Oh, yeah.  This thing is exploding.  It's so stupid.  Give me a quote.  What can I use?  It's like the extinction of the dinosaur.  I'll just pull things I watch on History Channel.  I don't care.  The news lady was all serious.  We will definitely have more on this.  More on this one.  This is a story we'll be watching.  It's developing.  Still developing story.  No, it's not.  You'll have the same exact story at 11 o'clock. 
[01:24:30]  Love it.  That's hysterical.  This is an outrage.  Oh, my tennis.  Wow.  It's on the back of Buzzers.  Upsetting people.  Yeah, that was funny.  I like that.  Yeah.  All right, Brewer.  Wow.  Now, let's get back to the jail.  Oh, you're not off now.  Oh, come on, man.  We've passed that.  Now, I told my whole story, and you were listening in the car with your lovely...  See you later.  ...your lovely wife.  Make sure you write us in a week. 
[01:25:00]  We'll come back next week.  Grab on to the wrap.  By the way, someone taped the 10 o'clock news on 5 and 9 for us, and we'll go over that  on Monday.  Yeah.  So, you heard my getting caught story.  Why do you have to put your glasses on for this story?  Because it's embarrassing.  It scones me.  They don't want to look people in the eye when you're talking about being a filthy animal  like that.  Filthy animal to yourself.  Cranking it.  You know how embarrassed you feel the second it's all over. 
[01:25:30]  So, you're in the car with your wife and your grandma listening to this crap.  Yeah, I'm listening, and I want to call, because I instantly started laughing.  Actually, Dee laughed even harder.  Because for...  I'm married eight years, man.  We've known each other a long time.  You do a lot of donkey playing.  A lot...  There's a lot of times when you do it.  Well, a couple times I almost got caught, and she'd have a talk with me.  But a similar...  Like your mom. 
[01:26:00]  I'm dumb.  Now, you really got to stop doing that.  If you want it, just come to me.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah, all right.  Hi, how are you doing?  Listen, can we do it right now?  Because, you know, I want to.  Yeah.  The time I got caught, the one big time, it turned into a big fight, because she turned...  First of all, you feel like a dick that you caught.  You feel like a dick.  There's nothing more humiliating.  I will take stepping in human feces and bare feet. 
[01:26:30]  Or you're staying there naked with your donkey in your hand, and you have another human being.  You're white.  Oh, God, man.  Looking at you in disbelief, like, what is wrong with you?  Yeah.  So, I instantly took the defense.  And I went, nothing.  I tried to play it.  Oh, no.  So, I went, nothing.  I'm just, nothing.  She's like, so, there's that weird barrier of, am I going to get away with this? 
[01:27:00]  No.  Can we just drop this?  Because you really don't want to go to battle here.  You were dressed, though?  Like you had something on?  No, no.  How did you cover up?  Hands were off.  How did you cover up?  I couldn't.  I just, I jumped on the side of the bed.  I was next to the bed.  So, I leaned down like I was trying to take a nap real quick.  I was napping.  I'm napping.  I was napping.  This is a lamer excuse that I don't think.  Well, you had no excuses.  Well, you got no excuses. 
[01:27:30]  You said, well, how do you get out of this?  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Sleeping.  So, I lay down, and she's like, so, there's that tense moment, like, please, you know  what's going on.  Just drop it.  Drop it.  All right?  Let's make believe this didn't happen, okay?  So, what, and there's that weird moment, and she goes, are you playing with yourself?  Oh, no.  That's not, I'm really mad right now.  Oh, like you're not humiliated enough. 
[01:28:00]  I'm really mad.  I go, what, why are you mad?  And she goes, that really offends me.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  So, now, you know, this is when you lose it.  Oh, no.  This is when you go, well, it shouldn't offend you.  Well, it does.  How does it feel?  I'm standing here in front of you.  Do I never give it to you?  I mean, how wrong is that?  And you feel the need that you have to hide on me and touch and play with yourself?  That's disturbing.  Let's not forget you're naked as you're yelling at Jeff. 
[01:28:30]  What is napping?  So, then I, I decided.  I didn't want to do that today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing.  And then, first you take the, first I took the argument of, um, I attacked her like this.  I said, well, I didn't want to bother you.  Because you said you were tired last night because the baby got up early.  What'd you say all day?  You got mad on me.  As soon as I woke up, you're like, I'm eating that today.  And I let you nap.  Did I not do that?  Yes, I did.  And I said, you look really good.  And so, you said you were tired.  You went downstairs. 
[01:29:00]  You said you were tired.  So, you took a nap.  So, I started playing myself.  So, all right?  Is that all right with you?  I'm trying to help you out.  And you're making me feel like a dick.  So true.  You guys know what I'm talking about.  Yes, I do.  Oh, my God.  You try to spin it.  You try to spin it and get out of it.  Turn it around.  But my wife, she knows me.  Look, the only human beings that are going to know you your entire life better than you is your wife.  And the reason you get so pissed at her is because she's so on and right. 
[01:29:30]  But you don't want to face it.  So, she goes, you'd even think, you know what, I wouldn't be offended if you at least tried.  But you didn't try.  You just decided you're going to go up and play with yourself.  Why didn't you compare your family?  Not taking that route.  Yeah, well, you're there yelling at your wife now, just sporting naked, and you're sporting, and you're just standing there now.  Like, is that pretty much takes you about five ticks down on the advantage scale, you know?  You're done.  Arguing naked, bad. 
[01:30:00]  And what sucks for me is I've got three, I have weird rooms.  It sounds worse than it is, but there's three mirrors.  It sounds way worse than it is, trust me.  So, I've got two angles on me so I can see myself.  And then I realize this, well, I'm caught in the middle of this whole thing.  Were you able to pull covers over yourself?  Look at me.  I'm hot.  Oh, no, I quickly, once we got over this thing, I quickly put up my, you know.  But now she's standing there as you're putting pants on.  And look how hot I am.  God, is that horrible. 
[01:30:30]  No, I can't look at myself.  I lose.  I'm like, oh, baby, baby, look in Mirror 3.  This reminds me of the dude in American Psycho when he's banging those two chicks, but he's looking at himself in the mirror while he's flexing his thighs.  Flexing.  That's hilarious.  Huey Lewis and the News.  This is Susudia.  Bill Collins.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  There he is.  The color is bone with a font that I picked. 
[01:31:00]  I love that movie.  You've got to tell the last part where Richard caught you in the.  Which one?  After you did the concert and all that.  And you were, you know, a little.  Which one?  I need better language here, Ope.  Help me out.  He's like, you know, if you guys could see Ope right now.  He's just leaning his head to the right and going.  You know, when you.  That was my visual for, like, you know, being high.  Like, being a little under the.  Oh, my God. 
[01:31:30]  Then you've got to deal with it.  Well.  When you were downstairs, like, you said, jamming, like, Judas Priest or something.  Giving yourself a concert and then decided.  Whoa.  Oh, no.  Exactly.  Exactly.  When I got some spare time, you always revert back to being 16.  Always.  Yeah.  Like you're down.  You know, Chris Rocker.  I'm a dicker.  You've got to have a.  We call it the Rob Half a jerk.  Scream. 
[01:32:00]  I'm the dungeons.  Nothing better than the Rob Half a jerk.  Now, that's a good.  Judas Digger says.  Run to the hills kind of jerk.  Rob Half a Judas Priest kind of jerk.  When leather and a bullwit.  Now, this is what.  Talking about living after midnight kind of jerk. 
[01:32:30]  This is like jerking after midnight.  Jerking after midnight.  Jerking till the dawn.  Till the morning.  Then I'm gone.  I'm gone.  So you're having a concert with yourself.  Jerking.  Jerking.  Nice head, dick. 
[01:33:00]  Jerking.  Jerking.  Jerking.  Jerking.  Wait, what's he say?  I come alive.  I come alive.  Yeah, he comes alive.  That's when my jerking goes all right.  At the midnight.  Jerking to the dawn.  Fuck it off, dick.  The volume better be down when you're jerking it to Judas Priest.  You can't jerking if the music's too loud. 
[01:33:30]  Jerking.  You're going to get come jerking if the music's too loud.  I put that big ball in my mouth.  And I start jerking like the gist.  And I put on it.  Jerking.  When I'm home alone, 95% of the time I spend jerking. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, here we go.  Wait.  I'm a baby for you.  I'm a baby for you.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  What's in it?  Wait.  I'm going to blow you.  It's perfect.  Wait, wait, wait.  This sounds good one.  I'm a baby for you.  I'm a baby for you.  I'm a baby for you.  Oh, my God.  I'm not locked.  Oh, you like that. 
[01:34:30]  Don't you faggot.  Oh, my God.  Hotter by the hour.  That's what I call the rock and roll jerk. 
[01:35:00]  And that's a good jerk.  Heavy metal jerk.  When you've been banging your head, leather of your snout kind of jerk.  We're talking love, fight, screaming for vengeance.  Leather, rubber gags, and zippers.  We're talking run to the hills, master of puppets, jerkin'.  Master, master, master of the jerkin' and pullin' the spades. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, Reg, what's up, man?  You got me on?  Yeah, go, man.  Hey, you guys are so funny.  Jerky.  All the time.  You guys are constantly funny.  Thank you.  I called in about last week.  Yeah.  I got this girl.  She wants to do sex for Sam in Philadelphia.  When we get there, we're going to work on that.  I know, but the guy said it's going to be like a year away.  No, it's a couple, not even two months away.  Who won that?  Who won that? 
[01:36:00]  Not even two months away.  No, we'll do it, I think early October we're going down.  You got to sign me up.  You got to take my name and number.  This girl's serious.  She wants to do two-point conversion everywhere we go.  Rich, when we get closer, we'll talk to you, okay?  It's way too early.  All right, I'll call you back.  All right, right on.  We'll remember you.  Jack from Philly checking in.  He says, there's no way out of it when you get caught beating it.  But there is a way to minimize the damage.  Look right in the eye while still stroking and say, look what you're making me do. 
[01:36:30]  Get down on your knees, start crying.  Look right now, man.  Look what I'm doing.  What have you brought me to?  I got no place else to jack.  I got no place else to jack.  Don't you make me stop doing this.  Don't you.  I got no place else to jack.  I ain't got nothing.  And I believe that would be the closer.  That's the officer in the gentleman's turn. 
[01:37:00]  That's the Richard Gale jack.  Oh, God.  Wow.  That hurt.  But, bro, you were under the influence.  You were jamming Judas Priest or something.  I can't get through this story.  That's fine.  You're kidding.  Ah, we get the image.  Just the visual of you coming downstairs.  The music's cracking.  You're high, naked.  Oh, dude. 
[01:37:30]  I wasn't naked.  Was this before or after that other episode?  See, let me start.  I wasn't naked.  But you have to be naked.  And my underwear on.  Now, is this before or after the other episode you just talked about?  Oh, this is after.  Oh, man.  So she must have been like, didn't we talk about this?  You have a problem.  Well, I honestly, what I did, I pulled that as a front.  I was going to say, I'm going to go downstairs writing.  You know.  Live at midnight. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  Rock it like a rainbow in the dark.  Na, na, na, na.  Right.  You have all the concert.  I'm tearing it up in my basement.  And then, you know, I wait until she falls into the story.  Keep it going.  And then, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  Oh.  All right.  Don't worry, isn't it?  Oh.  Well, you know, came down and again.  Oh, no. 
[01:38:30]  You're right.  There is no thrown in jail for the night.  There is no, can we ask you some questions?  Yeah.  You're thrown on the stand immediately.  Blink.  What the hell?  What did you just say to it?  Just.  Is there a problem?  I've got to go that route.  The problem.  Yeah.  Now there must be a problem.  God damn, that's funny.  That's it.  It's not getting better than that today, right?  There you go.  Jerking.  Bravo. 
[01:39:00]  Wow.  I can't.  Well.  I haven't laughed that hard.  It's embarrassing, man.  It's a long time.  But I get.  I usually get madder.  I'm like, well, you know.  Don't walk around.  You know that gets me all.  Well, can't you control it?  No.  I cannot.  That is why I've got to run in high.  It is worse than heroin.  When are you females going to realize that?  It's a gene.  It's a fluid in our body. 
[01:39:30]  You show us anything.  And we immediately, it's like, where can I go?  Oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Really?  Like an ape.  Yeah.  Throw my feces.  Come on.  You're all lying if it's not the truth.  No, it is absolutely the truth.  Oh, God.  That's too good.  All right.  How many people are going to do the Judas Priest jerk now?  See?

[01:43:00]  Why?  Yeah.  No, I heard he also writes for what?  Oh, Page Six or The Post or something?  Oh, yeah?  How about that?  There were rumors that there was, you know, some reporting going to happen about our little  party last night.  People were getting thrown out.  By the end of the night, it had gotten...  We, you know, where to blame?  Management of Hooters telling Anthony to stop cursing because there's little kids there.  Hey, he told me that both of us should stop with the language.  I didn't hear him.  Well, I didn't even tell you because I wasn't going to stop anyway. 
[01:43:30]  Tell the guy to go F himself.  I don't give a flying F because this guy's a douche.  You know how much beer we sold last night for Hooters?  Look.  If we weren't there with our crew, I swear to God, there would have been 10 people watching  the Mets lose.  No joke, right?  Yes.  And he's getting all pissed off.  Look, man.  If you're going to sell that much beer and our listeners are hanging, you're talking,  what, 500, 600 people went through the doors last night easily?  Yeah.  When they probably would have had 20 and the guy's getting pissed off?  Check your register, my friend.  Not only that, but most of the people that he thought he was offended wouldn't have been 
[01:44:00]  there in the first place.  You're in a place called Hooters.  Hooters, dummy!  If you're taking your kids to Hooters, what's your problem?  Kids shouldn't be up at 10.  Right.  But he came up and said, you know, there's some families sitting at some of those tables.  Meanwhile, it's just packed with O&A fans.  And believe me, what we were saying up on...  There's a family.  Where the hell are the families?  Families.  I didn't see any families.  Some people that look like the Manson family. 
[01:44:30]  Do you have a high chair?  Yeah.  You need a booster seat for Junior?  A booster seat.  Give him a booster seat so he can get a better look at your ass that's in the very short shorts.  Can we see the kids' menu?  Where's the kids' menu at Hooters?  What are they called?  Nubs?  The kids' menu.  We call it nubs here at Hooters.  Nubby fingers.  Nubs.  Nubby nipples.  They weren't pissed, were they?  I can't believe they would be pissed.  Unbelievable. 
[01:45:00]  But, you know, I guess...  We spent a lot of money in that joint.  And hey, man, you spend that much money, you're going to have to deal with at least one beer fight.  Oh, man.  Now, so we're getting people up and we're like, you know, F.  And the Fox crew was there for the O'Reilly factor.  They were taping some stuff from last night.  Now, you kicked out or you're leaving?  Some people were kicked out.  I left before we got kicked out.  And it was pretty much over by that point because the management was just fed up.  The upper portion where we were doing the signing, the floor completely covered with beer. 
[01:45:30]  Like, about a half an inch of beer over the entire floor.  Jim, at one point, people were just buying pitchers of beer so they could pour it over people's heads.  It wasn't even like, oh, well, I'm kind of drunk and I have a little beer left.  No, they were running to the bar to get full pitchers.  You were bringing out the tribal in everyone.  Oh, man.  Who's directly responsible for the beer fight?  Stinky, please, who?  Directly responsible for starting the beer fight.  What'd you do, Stink?  People from Fox. 
[01:46:00]  People from Fox.  Who in particular?  Who was it?  This person has called me and asked me not to out them.  All right.  So she started the beer fight.  And that was right after she gave Stinky Tongue.  Oh, Jesus.  Look, I don't know what was happening there.  All I know is at some point of the night, I stand up.  She grabs a pint glass of beer and goes to pour it on me. 
[01:46:30]  I go, no, no, no.  And Stinky and Banner around.  So they're grabbing the beer away from her.  But there's so much beer laying around that she just kept picking them up until everyone else's hands were full.  So they couldn't grab any more beer from her.  She throws it right at my crotch.  So now I'm standing there with my crotch soaked.  So now I'm just like, all right, you want to play?  We'll play.  I grabbed a pitcher.  There was a full pitcher of beer and dumped it right over her head.  And then I follow up with two pint glasses of Guinness at each boob. 
[01:47:00]  I just flung it at her.  Then beer is flying everywhere.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Let the games begin.  Oh, it was.  Because all of us that were stealing the beers out of her hand that she's trying to dump them on Anthony,  now we've got all beers on our hands.  So we just like followed Anthony's lead.  It's just like, all right.  Everyone doused her.  She was soaked head to toe with beer.  And at that point, the management started getting pissed off.  Another place we're not going to be able to go back to. 
[01:47:30]  This sucks.  That's all right.  The city's full of them.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  This is Shet.  Remember I was talking to you?  Yeah.  You had a big guy with a sister anyway you were telling me about?  Yeah, we remember you.  All right.  Before I got up to you guys, one of the waitresses come up to me and goes,  come on, move it, move it, move it.  I said, where the hell do you want us to move?  We're online.  After I was talking to you, I went to get all these autographs.  Yeah.  The guy with the blue shirt letting people in by you goes, come on, you've got to leave.  So I thought it was because I was in there too long talking to you.  He goes, no, you've got to leave the building. 
[01:48:00]  Why?  I said, what the hell did I do?  The building.  He said, you have to leave.  What reason did he give?  He said, finally, he said, you grabbed one of the girls.  I said, what girl?  You know, more people got thrown out last night at the end of the night than ever before.  So I went over by way.  You know, I met some friends there.  You know, people like, you know, they're by myself.  So I met some people.  So I said, well, I'm going to say goodbye to my new friends.  He goes, no, you're not.  I said, what are you going to do?  Throw me out again?  I'm leaving now.  So I went over and said goodbye.  And I tried talking to the owner, the guy with the black shirt. 
[01:48:30]  He says, I got to listen to my girl.  So she says, you grabbed her.  So you're out.  There you go.  So it was only about 8.30 right after I told my guy.  A lot happened.  8.30.  A lot happened after 8.30.  We do have to say a couple things.  In general, everyone was well behaved.  It got crazy at the end.  Yeah.  Because, you know, the beer fights.  Crazy at the end.  Yeah, the beer fights people that work for Fox.  Right.  The beer fights, you know, got a little crazy.  But I don't want people to think it was completely out of control all night. 
[01:49:00]  Secondly, the waitresses were absolutely awesome at Hooters last night.  Oh, yeah.  The waitresses rock, man.  They completely rocked.  Boy, I wonder if O'Reilly would have liked using some of that footage.  That would have been great if we would have had some of that on tape.  Angel.  Yo!  Nice.  Oh, angry Angel.  Did you have fun, Angry Angel?  Oh, man.  You crackers make party good, man.  What happened now?  The manager was pissed?  Yo, man.  Remember when you ran, because she was looking for you. 
[01:49:30]  I think she was the producer.  She was, like, so pissed.  I'm over here laughing.  I bump into somebody.  I turn around.  This guy looked at me like he wanted to kill me.  Oh, yeah?  He's like, just get the F out now.  Yeah, see, they were just throwing people out.  Oh.  And one I got to agree with, though, is the retarded Laverne and Shirley got thrown out.  And I applaud Hooters management for tossing them out on their hazard.  Thanks a lot, Angel. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, later.  All right, Angel.  Yes, Ben?  Oop's kind enough to tell retarded Laverne and Shirley are in her area, so we throw them out.  But then they complain.  And Oop's like, yeah, you know, it's not that big a deal.  Let them out.  But you're behind the table.  I got slobbering spit all over my face from Marion.  They tell you I'm going to fill out next week.  I'm going to make you so much.  I'm going to listen to the station.  So next time you do it, we'll let them sit next to you.  They crack me up, man.  They're annoying as hell.  I go, yeah, I'm going to.  She goes, where are you going on vacation? 
[01:50:30]  I go, Florida.  Oh, my God.  Me and my husband are going to Florida, too.  Where are you going?  And I'm just like, oh, please, God, no.  Not around the same time.  Please, God, no.  What a hotel.  It's great.  We'll hook up for the other day.  Double date I want as if it includes me throwing you off a boat in shark-infested waters.  With raw meat dangling from your side.  Yeah, because they wouldn't eat her plane.  They'd hack her up like a hairball. 
[01:51:00]  That little thing the cats do before they...  Here's the sound.  Here's the sound.  Here's the sound.  Here's the sound.  Here's the sound.  And then they trot away like nothing.  They eat this pseudo piece of crap.  That hairball.  What is it?  Is it hairball?  Is it crap?  Mouth crap.  And I crapped in the kitty litter.  Better pick it up before she comes home.  And they go into that mode where they're going...  At first, you're like, oh, my God. 
[01:51:30]  It's like the old game hot potato.  Do you pick him up?  Do you throw him?  He's on the couch, for God's sake.  What are you going to do?  Live grenade.  Live grenade.  You don't know?  Throw your body over him.  Save the family.  You don't know when it's going to go off.  You pick him up.  You can't throw the new covers.  Oh, no.  Yeah, when they're doing it on the bed, they hop up on the bed.  You'll fling him into a wall.  I'll kick him.  Get off the sheets.  Get off the sheets.  No.  Goes off in midair like an air burst. 
[01:52:00]  Took out the whole family.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  RFP, what's up with Chris, man?  I was at the Hooters event last night.  Yeah.  Let me tell you about the taco.  So I'm in there for like five minutes.  In walks Blind Matt with his dog.  He's hanging out.  And he's got a bottle of scotch.  And he's like, give me a glass of ice.  We're like, all right, give me a glass of ice.  He walks over, bro.  We're like, let me get a glass of ice.  The witch is like, what?  Whoa, whoa.  Sorry about that.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, we get Blind Matt a glass of ice. 
[01:52:30]  He's drinking out of the scotch bottle like a douche.  Anyway, Blind Matt, anyway, you rock, dude.  Me and James.  Oh, my God.  Is there a point?  I'm retarded.  Anyway.  Thanks, man.  Great.  Buddy.  Go ahead.  Okay, terrific.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Okay, terrific.  If there was a visual just now, when you take your hands and you make it look like binoculars 
[01:53:00]  over your eyes.  I know there's a point somewhere.  Look to the left, Bob.  Do you see anything?  Send a flare.  I mean, I see something on the right.  No, that's just a groundhog.  We saw a point at some point, but then five minutes ago it fell off the radar screen.  We have not seen the point since.  Get my new binoculars, please. 
[01:53:30]  Get the telescope.  Hey, Doug, tell us what.  What's up, Doug?  The party sounds like it was like a high school party last night, the first time your parents  go away for the weekend.  Exactly.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  It's about 1130, just pouring beer, wrecking the house.  Get off the chair, Dick.  And you guys hung me out before.  I didn't tell the screener what does bottoming out mean.  I didn't know what you guys were talking about.  I've had phone calls for the past hour.  I'm humiliated.  Oh, because we were talking about bottoming out.  That's called a jersey hitting the wall.  Hitting the wall. 
[01:54:00]  Hitting the back wall.  Yeah.  I had some chick call me and laugh and cancel a date tonight, too.  Thanks.  Later, guys.  All right, man.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, guys.  I just want to thank you for getting beer all over my leg during that beer fight.  Oh, you were part of the collateral damage?  Yeah, we were sitting there.  I was like at that first table.  Yeah.  Up on that upper table, right next to that upper level, right next to those stairs.  Didn't you see?  I wanted no part of it.  And then once I got drenched, I decided to...  Yeah, once you got some on you, all you started doing is grabbing stuff and pouring it on the chick. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I was throwing beer at her.  The funniest part was when she was going after Rick, though, and he tore her ass right out of the upper area.  He just went flying across there.  Yo, Opie, my friend didn't mean to hit on Sandy like that.  I don't care.  Hey, listen.  If Opie doesn't turn out, you know, my friend Larry, I got a tire shop.  If you ever, you know... 
[01:55:00]  How are you saying?  My girl was like, man, she really wanted to, like, fill up that one girl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Are you talking about Sandy right now?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She wanted to fill up which one?  The one with the big...  Yeah, what picture, Ben?  If you go to opianthony.com.  Sandy did?  Yeah, because this girl got a boob job.  Oh, so she just wanted to touch him.  Yeah, she was really...  Are you making it sound like she wanted, you know...  Well, who knows?  Keep going.  I'll tell you which one.  Nope.  I'm going to the pictures now.  That one right there. 
[01:55:30]  Photo 31.  Nope.  Well, that's her, too.  That one, yeah.  Which picture?  I think she spells her name Cindy with an ass.  Which number?  31.  Picture 31.  Let me see.  Whoa.  Those are pretty big guns.  Does it?  Real nice boob job.  And, yeah.  Fake.  Sam wanted to check him out.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We deliver keggers.  Nikki was there, too.  Danielle.  Hey, what's up?  What up?  Hey.  Last night was an awesome time. 
[01:56:00]  You had a good time last night?  I was one of the girls who wowed with the other girl.  Yeah.  I dropped the beer all over you.  Oh, sorry.  That's cool.  Nicey, nice.  All right.  Well, thank you, Danielle.  Hey, last night was great.  Thanks, guys.  Cool.  All right, bye.  Bye.  People had fun.  Teddy!  Hey, Jackass.  Hey.  I was one of the family members there.  You know, you have a good show, but you guys were out of line in front of the children.  Say all you want.  Defend all you want.  It was a public establishment.  What's the matter with you?  Shut up.  Shut up, Teddy.  You stupid son of a bitch. 
[01:56:30]  I should swap my beef jerky around your freaking throat.  My kids were there at Hooters.  You're lying, Teddy.  My kids were there.  My son was swapping his wiener on the table, and you were cursing.  You're lying, Teddy.  I got you cursing.  All right, Jackass.  Thank you.  Very funny.  Son of a bitch.  I should come down there and get my ass cheeks and shit.  All right.  I think he was done with his joking.  Stephanie.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, Stephanie.  How are you?  I think he's gone.  I'd just like to clarify something that really, that hasn't been brought up, and it'll be a 
[01:57:00]  very short point.  Yeah.  Um, I don't think that everybody knows what was happening between Stinky and I before  this beer brawl took place.  Which was?  We didn't even name names.  We didn't even say anything about who was who.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were keeping it on the T.L.  Yeah, you were keeping it on the T.L.  Yeah, you were keeping it on the down low.  Thanks.  Um, I was being assaulted by Stinky, verbally, might I add.  Oh, my God.  You were so lying.  Really?  We were sitting behind the table where you guys were, always to be like, let's sign 
[01:57:30]  it on the grass and people were coming up.  All of a sudden, she just pours beer on me.  That's it.  Honestly, gentlemen, do I strike the type of woman that would do something like that  randomly?  I know you poured beer on me randomly.  That's for sure.  Because you challenged me.  You said, you know, like, ha, ha, ha.  No, actually, I was walking away from the table, and you had a beer, and you decided  for some reason to throw the beer at me, and I was going, no, no, no, I don't want 
[01:58:00]  to get into a beer fight.  But everyone knows I hate Sticky.  I don't want to be involved in things like that.  And then you finally got one in your hand and threw it on me.  That's because you challenged me first.  No, no.  I was a victim in all of this.  Stephanie, I swear to you.  Now, wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'd be the first one to jump at your defense, and I don't know what was happening with  anyone else.  But I know in my circumstance, I was leaving the table to walk downstairs, and you threw  a beer on me.  And that's all that happened between me and you. 
[01:58:30]  There was nothing else.  I was being, what I thought, very nice and everything.  You goaded me.  You goaded me.  I challenge you to lift my donkey.  Stephanie, I swear to God, I was not goading you into anything with the beer.  You goaded.  Let me, can I just do a quick recap?  How old are you?  Okay, go ahead.  Is by the end of me.  Did we egg you on, too?  What happened?  Now, let Stephanie give her side here, what happened, because I know...  Stinky was making some inappropriate comments to me.  Like what?  First of all.  Well, first of all, Vic was trying to bribe me to French kiss him for my birth. 
[01:59:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I didn't have to bribe you.  You did it on your own accord, honey.  Twice.  Oh, my God.  I mean, come on.  Really?  You were cleaning his teeth with your tongue.  Wow.  It was like dental floss.  Hold on, let her defend herself.  Let her give her points, Stephanie.  Does anyone believe that, though?  Does anyone believe that?  Let her...  I don't know.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Look, I don't know what...  Drinks are on the house.  That I randomly just came on to Stinky. 
[01:59:30]  Did I do that?  Stephanie, I don't know what was happening.  Like I said, I wasn't listening to that.  I just know that now you're saying that I was goading you into something, and I absolutely  was not.  When I was being...  Let me just refresh your memory.  When I was being sprayed by Stinky with his, you know, the beer that he shook up...  That was me.  I apologize.  It wasn't beer.  Oh, Jim.  Let's just leave it at that we all had a really good time.  Hold on, hold on.  What happened?  No, because I was the victim.  Victim. 
[02:00:00]  And then, Anthony, you made fun of me or something.  You were like, ha, ha, ha.  Like, you can't get him.  You know something?  I can't get him.  Everyone that knows me, everyone that knows me knows I don't get involved in things like  beer fights.  You know, I...  And then when I was saying, no, Stephanie, don't throw the beer at me.  Do not throw the beer at me.  And every beer you picked up, one of the guys would grab it out of your hand so you couldn't  throw it on me until their hands were full.  And then they couldn't grab the last beer you picked up, and that was the one you threw  on me.  But the whole time I'm going, Stephanie, no, do not throw the beer on me. 
[02:00:30]  So that when you threw it at me, that's when I put the pitcher over your head.  Okay, so let me...  So is this what you're saying, then, that you and seven men couldn't, like, refrain  from having me throw one beer on your lap?  No.  You know something?  No.  Yeah, the guys that were standing there could not keep you from throwing a beer on me.  Absolutely.  I was trying to get down the stairs.  I was leaving.  Oh, okay.  So six pussies on the Open Anthony Show couldn't stop me picking up one little beer and throwing  it on your lap. 
[02:01:00]  They would have cracked you in the face, maybe, but I didn't think they were holding back.  People were so afraid to say, you know, they went out, they worked hard, they got all  banged up in the middle of the night.  I thought we were having a good time.  I thought it was pretty fun.  I think they came home, they'd do some crazy things.  It was a party, man.  It was a party.  And then all of a sudden, they're like, ah, that was not me.  There were a lot of people so...  What's the big deal, man?  So, so, so, so, man.  I'll be honest.  I don't...  Stephanie, I don't think your alcoholism is a problem.  I think it's fun.  Norton.  It's all right.  No.  I just feel like I'm not being represented properly. 
[02:01:30]  No one is taking into account that...  Nearly, I was defending myself with a small little spritzer on Stinky's lap just to try  to get him to cool down a little bit.  And, you know...  I threw a whole beer down my shirt and into my crotch.  And then you threw a beer, a pint glass of beer at my crotch.  And that's when the pitcher went over your head and...  Oh, my God.  And then beers were flying everywhere.  Beers were flying everywhere.  Right.  That is the truth.  When did the last time you had fun like that?  Was she laughing at the time?  Oh, yeah, dude.  She was laughing hysterical.  She's laughing.  Where's Opie?  I'm going to hug him. 
[02:02:00]  I'm soaking wet.  There you go.  There were beer fights...  There you go.  This wasn't the only beer fight.  There were beer fights everywhere.  I don't know where it all began, but it was just a mess.  When's the last time you did that?  All I have to say is that by the end of the evening, I could literally wring my shirt  out with beer.  Someone unsnapped my bra.  Steph, it was a pleasure being hugged by you when you were filled with beer.  I enjoyed it.  Yeah, we all got the big beer hug.  It was nice.  I would just like a little bit of recognition that I was a little bit of a victim when all  of you jumped on me and reported here. 
[02:02:30]  No, there was no victim there.  Listen, Betty Ford, you really did instigate a lot of it.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, we have a new nickname, though, for Stinky.  What's that?  Sodomizer.  Sodomizer?  What the hell was Stinky doing?  He's very inappropriate.  You know something?  Let me tell you.  Stephanie, you have selective memory.  I got to tell you, you have selective memory because from where I was sitting, that absolutely  wasn't the way things were going down.  You were definitely being fun and playful with your beer throwing, and you were starting 
[02:03:00]  the beer throwing.  The injustice, yes, I did start it.  Oh!  Yeah, and then when you start it, beer is going to be...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  If you're the only one that starts throwing beer at people, you got to assume other people  are going to throw beer back at you.  But I was being verbally assaulted.  I didn't see any of that.  Maybe we didn't...  No one saw that.  And I never saw you...  I never saw you once all night looking upset or anything about what was going on.  It looked like everyone was having fun. 
[02:03:30]  Especially as shown in picture 53 on opianthony.com from last night.  You can see her holding Stinky in her lap.  Let me look at picture 53.  Oh, you guys look like you're just getting along.  That's all.  You're smiling.  Stinky is in your lap.  Looks like victimizing.  All right.  He was in the chair and he was saying inappropriate things.  All right.  I betrayed him.  Steph, we get the point.  Just acknowledge that he was inappropriate and I was defending myself.  No.  Say one thing I said that was inappropriate.  Stinky's not acknowledging that. 
[02:04:00]  No, I won't.  Can I get in on this?  Because I totally get what's going on here.  Who's this?  It's open.  Oh, hi.  You got...  You're...  Can you defend me a little bit?  No, listen.  You got some power.  You got some prestige.  You're a big time producer.  No, no, no.  No, but listen.  This is what's going on.  I totally get it.  And you don't want to be portrayed as, you know, being in this wild scene.  But you know what?  People that have professional lives have fun as well.  Yeah.  That's right.  I have no problem with that. 
[02:04:30]  The only thing...  It's okay that you were in the middle of a beer fight.  Yeah.  Maybe she has a boyfriend.  There doesn't have to be a victim and a perp.  There was a bunch of people having a beer fight.  Are you thinking like people...  I am a victim.  Are you thinking people at Fox are going to look down on you because you were in one beer  fight at Hooters with, you know, a bunch of people?  Oh, my God.  The only thing I'd like to acknowledge is that the sodomizer instigated the beer throw.  And I will admit...  Why are you calling him the sodomizer? 
[02:05:00]  Where did that come from, Stephanie?  It was in all my...  And you know, Rick was holding ransom, my pocketbook, if I didn't French kiss...  Oh, my God.  You know what?  That's the first...  She is...  That I believe.  That's the first thing I do believe.  There is no way...  Full crap.  Rick, Rick.  I would never...  No way, Rick.  Stephanie, I am completely on your side on this one.  Oh, my God.  I believe Rick would do that.  You guys are douchebags.  I believe Rick would do that.  I would never do that.  Everything else is questionable, but Steph... 
[02:05:30]  I was...  I was standing next to you.  I was standing next to you, Ope, trying to get you to turn around to watch her tongue kiss  stinky.  What's that, Rick?  This is sick of legal, isn't it?  This is sick of legal, isn't it?  This is sick of legal, isn't it?  Rick, you like to have fun.  That is definitely something you would try to do.  Pissed up, Rick.  How are you?  Admit that.  No.  No, I would not hold her purse hostage.  Yes, you did.  I did not.  I didn't even know you had a purse.  Oh, my God.  Oh, and then the sodomizer was walking around with my purse over his shoulder like a little 
[02:06:00]  faggot.  Oh, look at the language.  Hey, don't say that.  It's for a hostile work environment.  Why do you call him the sodomizer?  That's a pretty big thing to be calling somebody.  Faggot.  Sodomizer.  Sodomizer.  You're a faggot-ass sodomizer.  Wouldn't somebody have to commit sodomy to be the sodomizer?  Well, wait.  Can I go back to just one moment?  What type of sodomy was done?  Well, you know, it's really not appropriate for me to discuss this on the air.  Stinky, what did you do? 
[02:06:30]  I did nothing at all.  I was trying to stop her from a rampage in the office.  Stinky, you just started yelling sodomizer.  You ended up in the office after this show.  She had to get a shirt and everything.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Can I tell you who the only nice person was to me?  Who?  Earl.  You said person.  Stephanie, I wasn't being nice.  Wait for a while.  No, Anthony, you're nice.  You're not really involved in this.  And I think there were people that were involved.  It's the Ricks.  It's that weird guy with the little mustache that was trying to tell me I was sexy. 
[02:07:00]  And then he's like...  Oh, dirty.  Oh, dirty.  All right.  Again, Stephanie, I agree with you on the old dirty thing.  No, B.  No, you okay?  That's my word.  B, let me tell you.  Someone had a really quick hand and they shoved their hand up my shirt and all of a sudden I didn't have a bra on anymore.  Hmm.  Is that right?  I thought you dropped something there.  Who was that?  All right.  Listen, can we move on from this?  I'd like to bury it, yeah.  But I just want to make sure that everyone knows that, you know, I wasn't just a random beer thrower, that I was a victim. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Now, I see you as being the random beer thrower on at least me.  She feels like she had a reason to throw beer.  Okay, good.  Thank you.  And that I was harassed by your staff.  Will this be on the O'Reilly factor?  Why don't you make a new special for our...  Members of our own staff were assaulted and I can see it now.  They were sodomized.  I can see it now.  We're sodomized.  You know, harassed. 
[02:08:00]  No, no, no.  You guys at Fox put your cameras away way too soon.  Yeah.  Can you imagine if they got the beer fight?  Wait, wait, another point to know is...  And this is a typical night with the O.P. and Anthony Curl.  This is in one of their own homes.  But that is about to rock!  What happened, Stephanie?  This had nothing to do with Fox.  Fox was gone when this happened.  Oh, I know.  All right.  So I don't know why you're relating the two together because Fox clearly had nothing to do with this.  No, that's what we're saying.  We're saying that it would have been great if the camera was still there.  Otherwise, I'm sure they'd be pressing charges. 
[02:08:30]  On what?  For sodomy.  You know, I would love to know, when you throw a word around like sodomy,  that's a pretty stiff charge, no pun intended.  And I'd like to know where that's coming from.  You know...  Stinky, do you have any clue why she's calling you that?  Stinky?  Stinky, be honest now.  Be honest, man.  She was going like berserk in the office, like leaving notes for people, going to people's computer,  and I was like...  Memos, memos.  I left memos.  I was trying to get away from the computers.  She just starts yelling, sodomizer, sodomizer. 
[02:09:00]  Really?  Wow, I got this clear.  Stephanie, what did he do that would merit being called sodomize?  You know, Stinky tried to lure me up to the office.  I think he thought he was going to get some or something.  I don't know.  Stinky thought he was getting some.  Stinky tried to make a pass at you once, so...  You stuck a tongue in my mouth.  What are you talking about?  You did?  Now, that I saw.  He did do that.  That was before.  Any time I needed any sort of protection, there was some sort of bribe involved. 
[02:09:30]  I'm going to wrap it up now, but all I have to say...  No, Rick, you've got to stop.  I don't know where the sodomizer comes from.  That's a good word.  This is a bribe.  I don't know where the sodomizer comes from.  Can we move on?  Yeah.  Chick gets all banged up, next thing you know, bribing, sidemizing, harassment.  When's the peace airing?  All I have to...  This is a non-Fox event.  All right.  We understand that.  I know we shouldn't be talking about business because this has nothing to do with business.  This is no reflection on the company.  Okay.  And I want to make sure that all the lawyers here are aware of this. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know something?  You'd be real hard-pressed to get anything going, Stephanie.  Yeah.  I swear to you.  Anthony?  Yeah.  I'd really like to have, like, a rematch, but this time I think that you should be a  man and you shouldn't have all your guys come on and then attach me.  You know something?  If we had agreed to have some kind of beer fight, sure, mano y mano.  But you know something?  I was leaving the bar.  I wanted to go to my goddamn room and get to sleep and you throw a beer on me. 
[02:10:30]  It wasn't like I agreed to some kind of beer fight, Stephanie.  Okay.  Well, let's set something up because I really feel like you took unfair advantage of your  staff suck-upness.  Ooh.  And they all soaked me.  A little innocent woman standing in the corner.  Poor innocent woman.  All right.  Shivering as pitchers of beer are poured on me.  He did look very sexy, though, by the way.  Steph, sleep off the hangover and call us when you're in a better state of mind because  you're delusional right now.  Okay.  But I want a rematch.  All right, Steph.  Okay. 
[02:11:00]  Bye, guys.  Thank you.  There she goes.  Holy Jesus.  You know what I'm saying?  Palomino.  Good Lord.  Can anyone have a party anymore?  No.  It was a party.  We're not waking up.  You get all banged up.  You know something?  If there was even an inkling that something was going on that she was upset about or that  she was being harassed or anything, I'd be the first one.  And God damn it, I would be the first one to say something.  That's really annoying.  Because I like just going out and having a good time like this.  I don't want to sound like we have to defend ourselves against something that didn't happen. 
[02:11:30]  And I swear to God, when that beer fight started, I was leaving.  I wanted no part of a goddamn beer fight.  And she threw a beer on me.  Yeah, she's a girl.  That's fine.  But you know something?  When she throws a beer on Stinky and then throws one on me and she's flinging beer around,  she's going to get all of us throwing beer back at her.  It's a fun event.  It is.  And I don't even care.  It was fun.  I was laughing.  I'm like, God damn, we got a lot of beer on us.  Chicks are never wrong.  But now when she's trying to cop this, I'm like, chicks are never wrong. 
[02:12:00]  Please.  That's happened.  You get banged up.  Show their boogies.  When you go to a party.  Can we move on?  Just enjoy it.  I'm exhausted.  We'll hit that few lines.  Our own staff was brought into this web of horror and debauchery here on the O'Reilly Factor.  We will show you what happened that night.  No, no.  Let's just move on.  Let's go to the FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Hi, this is Jen. 
[02:12:30]  I want to send a big, giant FU out to my pinky ring wearing bad campaign having moron of a boss.  First of all, I don't know who you think you're trying to fool with that fake hair so many doors.  Because, oh, it looks so much like real hair.  Second, you're so stupid that you take your fake teeth out at night, put them on your nightstand, and your dog eats them.  Now, all I have to do is look at your gums all day long.  Unbelievable.  So, for not retiring soon enough, and for making my life miserable, a big FU lude out to my boss. 
[02:13:00]  Next message.  Yeah, this is Steve from Staten Island.  I'd like to send a special **** to all the girls who don't want on Wednesdays.  Come on, girls, whip them out.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big FU out to all the **** tours in Manhattan.  It's in front of my goddamn truck when I'm trying to make it through a goddamn light.  They could take a picture of all the pretty lights in your goddamn Times Square.  FU.  Go back to your own freaking countries.  End of message.  Hey, this is Billy Idol, and I'm wild, and I'm crazy, and I'm listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[02:13:30]  Anthony, rat race.  Yes, Param Pictures and Fireworks Pictures presents Rat Race in theaters today.  This movie takes place in Las Vegas, where a rich tycoon and a bunch of his rich friends pit six unsuspecting teams against each other  to race for millions of dollars hidden somewhere across America.  It's the gambling experience of a lifetime.  These six teams will stop at nothing to win, lie, steal, cheat, and play dirty tricks.  Sounds like stinky.  The tongue, everything, in this mad tash for cash. 
[02:14:00]  There are some really huge stars in this movie.  Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Whippy Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., the little midget Seth Green,  John Lovitz, Fracking Meyer, Kathy Niengrain, Amy Stort.  Directed by Jerry Zucker of Airplane and Naked Gun fame.  It's rated a PG-13 and is predicted to be the comedy of the summer opening.  Wow, there's some tough competition.  The comedy of the summer.  Rat Race opening today in theaters everywhere. 
[02:14:30]  Opie and Anthony, every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon, 1027 WNEW.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Barua!  Norton stopped by.  We're having fun.  Looks like D.C. is really, really pissed off right now.  I'm going down there.  Let's go to Washington.  Washington.  Brian.  Yeah, what's up, man? 
[02:15:00]  You tell us.  And they cut you guys off for the pre-game show.  How much does that suck?  The pre-season game, like anyone gives a crap.  Enough of this pre-game football crap.  Stinks.  Last week, we lost two hours in Boston.  And it isn't even to the game itself.  It's to pre-season pre-game.  Pre-season pre-game.  Does it get any more boring than that?  Who cares?  The only pre-game that would be great would be the Vikings, just to watch them all reacting.  Because, I'm serious.  You know, there's a dead guy on the field.  They all have to go out there and win one for him. 
[02:15:30]  Then they get pounded 21-3.  Hey, Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Hey, Jim Brewer, man.  I was watching you last night on Comedy Central.  Oh, okay, cool.  Was he funny?  What skit was he doing?  He was, they had half-baked on last night.  Oh, half-baked on me.  There you go.  Excellent.  Right on.  You will live forever.  You will live forever on Comedy Central.  You are taking the millennium.  All right, Brian.  Sorry about that.  Hey, can I sit on hold until 7?  Hey!  No, man.  We're going to make you suffer.  Oh, damn. 
[02:16:00]  All right, thank God.  All right, cool.  Where's he from?  Where was that guy from?  Washington, D.C.  Yeah, I'll be there.  Look out.  Well, now they can't hear you.  Look out.  We like our football around here, but we could care less about pre-game, pre-season football.  Yeah.  It's gay.  I'm a gay.  Hey, all the other cities.  I don't, people in Washington, a bunch of tools.  Come on, I'm kidding.  Let's all make fun of Washington.  I just traded for Corey Stringer.  Oh, God.  You're awful. 
[02:16:30]  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Can I?  Yeah?  No, I just wanted to tell it real quick.  You know, I'm not big on stories, but I had something happen today.  Like, you ever have something prove just how worthless you are?  I'm doing a film, and I'm shooting in Jersey City, and I'm coming through the Holland Tunnel,  and I am, I have my finger in my nose.  Bumper, I mean, awful.  You dig in?  You dig in.  Like I was trying to shovel out of an avalanche, man.  It would be disgusting.  I look over, I hear a horn beep.  There's ten people in a van that I'm doing the movie with, staring at me. 
[02:17:00]  Aw, man.  I go about three cars up, I'm back in my nose, and I had something in my nose.  I look, as is true, the lighting technician and the boom guy are in the car.  I am worthless.  And they saw you picking.  Yeah, it's not a great story.  I'm just a disgusting man.  I didn't say this was going to, believe me, this is going to be a movie of the week.  I picked my nose and got busted by 12 people in two minutes.  I had to see them all tomorrow.  And slow.  Hey, One, first, I have two things.  First, it's no wonder why people are jealous of you after last night, and we know who we're 
[02:17:30]  talking about.  Two, I want to know, Rick.  Wait, wait, wait, what happened?  What are you talking about?  Who, what?  You know, the stern guy.  Oh, I think you said.  It's no wonder why he's jealous of you guys, because last night rocked.  Oh, whatever.  We just like to have fun, man.  Number two, Rick, how tough was it to get the blind guy down to that van last night?  Because I was outside before O&A came down.  Wait, what happened?  We missing another story?  Oh, yeah.  Because you guys all went back to the office, and we were trying to get the blind guys out 
[02:18:00]  of here.  And he's hammered?  Oh, man.  And Dave was just hammered.  And Rick had to get him going all the time down there.  Watch where you go.  Well, Dave admitted to us today, because he called Rick to ask what he did on the show yesterday.  He doesn't remember anything past, like, 4.30.  Maybe I ought to stop the drinking thing, he's saying.  Yeah.  Maybe I ought to slow down.  Supposedly, he had some painkillers, too.  There's a lot of this going on.  Ow!  Ow!  Dude, watch my back!  Ah!  Ow! 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my shin!  Yeah, Ben.  Dave was so wasted.  I come out in the hallway there, and he's out there with Earl.  He's like, Earl, give me another drink.  And Earl won't have any of it.  He picks up his cane and starts swinging it around.  They're all drunk.  So then I go, Dave, you've got to chill out.  His eyes want an effing drink.  So then at that point, he lights up a cigarette.  I'm like, dude, you can't have a cigarette.  And then he's swinging at the air like that.  Then Jim Bolella, Jim Bolella from production goes down there. 
[02:19:00]  He's trying to get in the door, and he's pushing Jim out of the way.  Bro, this is totally wasted.  Are you guys crazy?  We do.  Most of this stuff is videotaped.  This place has turned into a mess, Jim.  It's like an insane asylum.  We do a professional radio show, and we're also babysitters.  Although, in fairness to Dave, 300 years ago, swinging that cane, Earl would have got him a drink.  Oh, Jim.  All right, guys.  Look at you later.  Angelo, thank you.  All right.  Oh. 
[02:19:30]  Oh.  I was waiting.  Makes you long for a Corey string again.  Oh.  So it was tough to get him down into the van, huh?  Oh, man.  We finally get him into the elevator.  That was a chore in itself because he didn't want to go, and then he's looking for another drink.  Just wait until the doors open and the empty shaft is there and tell him to step in.  He was so wasted.  He is one of those really drunk, belligerent guys.  Thank God.  Well, not thank God he's blind, but sometimes I say, thank God he's blind. 
[02:20:00]  And because, you know, let me tell you something.  He's standing right outside the studio when we were leaving the show last night.  Oh, you told me this.  This is funny.  And I'm walking past him trying not to make a peep or have anyone, like, someone turns  around and goes, yo, Anthony.  I'm like, shut up.  And I walk past him because the second he heard me, he'd be like, Anthony, come here, man.  Let me talk to you.  And then it's just a drunken babble fest for a half hour. 
[02:20:30]  And I had things to do.  So you look like a bird, like, trying to hear the worms.  Oh, I'm creeping.  I'm just creeping past him as slow as I could.  What is that?  It's easy sneaking past blind people.  Yeah.  Hey, isn't it?  Hey, Rich.  Yo, dude.  You've been on hold for two and a half hours.  Wow.  Man, dude.  I've been listening to you guys for two weeks in Seattle.  Oh, yeah?  Wow.  Are we even on in Seattle?  Yeah, man.  Oh, cool.  You got on two weeks ago.  I actually worked for the radio station.  Oh, you worked for the station? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Cool, man.  No, no, I forget we're on in Seattle because they haven't added you to the syndication list, man.  Oh, okay.  But the virus has spread to Seattle and I think Portland.  And Portland, too.  Yeah, we like to call ourselves a little AM station that could.  What do you guys do when we go to commercials and stuff?  Because we just found out yesterday in San Francisco we're on a tiny little AM station.  Oh, no.  They play really, really bad country songs and stuff.  We play stuff like Limp Bizkit and the stuff you guys play.  All right.  Good, good, good, good.  The Classic Rock station, our FM station, is actually selling you guys. 
[02:21:30]  So they're working on, you know, like the Love Pantry and things like that to sell to.  What is the Love Pantry?  Oh, it's like this, you know, items shop, I guess you could say.  Ah, like adult stuff?  There you go, yeah.  Yes.  Big time toys.  Right on.  All right, Rich.  When are you guys going to head out here?  I know we've got a little bit of a following.  We're going to try and go out and rent it like an old panel van and put WOW on it on a Wednesday sometime.  Well, there's quite a bit of United States of America between us and you guys. 
[02:22:00]  So I would say somewhere in the 2020s.  Because there's a few other cities.  We're getting on horseback right now.  I'll start the petition now.  We'll get enough names out so you guys can come out.  Yeah, we'll get everywhere, believe me.  You guys get something going on, we'll come out.  All right, guys.  All right, Rich.  All right, you suck.  Thank you.  Later, man.  There goes Rich from Seattle.  Lady Di, one half of the retarded, Laverne and Shirley.  Hello.  Hi, Lady Di.  How are you doing? 
[02:22:30]  You're the only thing that actually makes that guy grateful to be blind.  Hey, listen.  Listen, I've got a question for you guys.  Are you there?  She's already starting.  Why were we thrown out of Hooters yesterday?  We didn't do anything wrong.  Lady Di.  Because you're fat and awful.  What?  Awful.  Who is that?  Jim Norton over there?  Very good.  Hi, Mr. Brewer.  How are you doing?  Good.  Oh, she doesn't shut up.  She's so effing annoying.  Now, if you shut your craw...  Okay.  No, that means just shut up.  Don't say okay.  Don't say nothing.  Just shut up. 
[02:23:00]  Can you please just bite off some eight-year-old's arms so you can't talk anymore?  Well, we had to leave at 10 o'clock anyway, but, you know.  We're still annoyed about that attack on Robert Shaw.  You're still talking.  Okay.  Shut up.  Shut up.  No.  Just stop.  No laughing.  Nothing.  Just let us talk.  Okay.  Anthony.  You were thrown out of Hooters last night.  You and your annoying little cohort.  Like a couple of retarded, bizarro world crime fighters, you two. 
[02:23:30]  Always together.  Just effing people up.  You drive them crazy.  That's their secret...  That's their superhero power.  They drive you insane.  No, we don't.  We don't.  I thought it was Marian's saliva.  Well, they have special powers unto themselves.  Temporary blindness every time Lady Di flashes you.  You get temporarily blinded because your own retina shuts down.  You fly over rapes and kill the erection.  You're so bad. 
[02:24:00]  You know she's listening to the show, you know.  We don't care.  And then the other one, yeah, her lisp does something to your hearing and your balance,  and you just fall down like a bowling pin.  Coincidentally enough, she's got the same shape as one.  A bowling pin.  I don't...  What a shame.  Oops.  I don't know what happened.  Lady Di, not just a name, a great idea.  Uncle John.  Hey, Hope.  How you doing? 
[02:24:30]  Pretty good.  You were just asking about what the other station is doing when you're on break?  Yeah.  I'm coming up.  I got you on the Philly station right now.  I'm coming up from way down South Jersey.  And they're doing weather breaks.  They're saying, weather on the shore on 94, stuff like that.  Oh, I hate weather and traffic stuff.  Well, it means nothing.  But hey, I'll tell you something.  It was so great.  You'll lose a signal coming down South and pick you up on Philly.  I missed about 30 seconds of the show.  It's super.  All we have to do is get Hartford, and you can hear the show from Boston all the way down  South of Washington.  How cool would that be? 
[02:25:00]  That sounds good.  That's about how far I traveled.  Thanks, guys.  See you.  All right.  I've been there.  It really stinks.  It's awful.  Insurance capital.  I've been there.  It's a creepy dump, and I hate Hartford.  I'd rather miss the show than listen to it driving through Hartford.  Sucks.  It is an awful little area.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  They should put chlamydia in the drinking water.  There you go.  Brewer, turn my mic off.  I'm sorry, man.  We like to call it the little city that could. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  The little AM station that could.  Is that like a running joke around there?  We like to call ourselves, shut up.  Yeah.  Go, go, go.  No, I actually lost the phone.  That's okay.  That's okay.  I lost the phone.  The little AM station that could.  Do everything except generate a lot of advertising dollars.  You know, this show has an attitude, and in San Francisco, they're certainly not helping  that attitude when we go to commercials and they're playing country songs. 
[02:26:00]  Country.  Sticks.  Yee-haw!  It's weird.  There's so many gay people.  It's such a, it's not a rural area at all.  I know.  I don't understand why they like the country.  Yeah.  They were playing, you know, taps for a sick friend or something.  I mean, that you'd expect.  Okay.  All right.  No, I don't.  All right.  Let's do it.  All right.  No, I don't.  Okay.  Okay, now.  You piped out over there.  Okay.  For the love of Eve. 
[02:26:30]  I hope I didn't put the kibosh on anything.  Golly, jeez.  Oh, Jiminy Creek.  Okay, what are you driving at?  That was a little, little icky.  Oh, jeepers creepers.  What are you driving at?  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Behave yourself.  All right.  We should play Brother Joe's Dickie Betts song.  Yeah.  I don't think I heard this one.  It's funny.  Yeah, Dickie Betts.  You know, Dickie from the Allman Brothers. 
[02:27:00]  He has a little hobby.  It's called punching his wife in the face.  Yeah.  It's killer.  Some people do modeling.  You know, they put models together.  Some people maybe golf.  He does.  He punches a whittle.  They do some whittling.  Oh, it's a great day out.  Yeah.  Oh.  He prefers, you know, what do I want to do today?  What do I want to do?  What do I got a hankering for?  Oh, yeah.  Drinking and punching my wife in the face.  So he, recently, she was driving.  She was driving.  How?  Because he's responsible. 
[02:27:30]  She was driving.  He's responsible.  You know, if he had been drinking, he probably doesn't want to drive.  So she's driving.  They get into some kind of argument.  As she's driving, he leans over and punches his wife again in the face.  As he still has something going for the January punching of his wife in the face.  Good boy.  In court.  And we saw him out at Asbury Park.  He was at the road show appearance we did at the Stone Pony.  He was playing later that night.  He came on stage, had his wife with him, said hi to the crowd, sat in on the nerds with 
[02:28:00]  the nerds with him.  He did amazing.  He did amazing ramblin' man, like a 20-minute version.  Ramblin' man.  Then he went back to his room, I guess, where seconds later, a security detail from the  bar ran out the door, ran to the room where Dickie was once again doing what?  What?  Punching his wife in the face.  Very good, Norton.  Good boy.  Punching his wife in the face.  Or as we like to call it, keeping things around the house straight.  That's how you decide what's being watched on television.  You calm down over there. 
[02:28:30]  You want to watch Lifetime, do you?  You settle down now.  You settle down.  I said yield, bitch.  Didn't you see that light?  So, Brother Joe.  Yeah, Brother Joe, of course, had to make a song about it.  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Hitting and kicking and punching you in the head. 
[02:29:00]  When it's time for your beating, you take it like a man.  Yeah, I assaulted you again.  I warned you once, and you just kept on bitching.  I stomped my cowboy boot down on your toes.  But you still didn't get the message, you effing slut. 
[02:29:30]  So, I had to break your nose.  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Hitting and kicking and punching you in the head.  When it's time for your beating, you take it like a man.  Yeah, I assaulted you again. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Oh, I assaulted you again.  Open it, man!  All right, so I'll do it again  All right, so I'll do it again  Okay, terrific.  All right, there's Brother Joe's song. 
[02:30:30]  We've got to take a break.  We'll play What Did We Learn on the Show today.  How's that sound, huh?  In education.  Opie Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Ponderous.  Effin' ponderous.  Dick, Dick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, Anthony, SummerSlam, WWF pay-per-view happening this Sunday, huh?  Yeah.  Sponsored by Chef Boyardee.  Chef Boyardee, the pay-per-view event of the summer,  finally here as the World Wrestling Federation presents SummerSlam,  live this Sunday, sponsored by, yes, Chef Boyardee. 
[02:31:00]  The Rock is back in his pay-per-view, first pay-per-view since WrestleMania.  Finally, Team WWF looks to lay the smacketh down on the alliance  as The Rock and Booker T buy for the WCW Championship.  Then, ever since Stone Cold Steve Austin turned his back on the WWF,  Kurt Angle made it a personal mission to teach the Rattlesnake a lesson  and return the WWF Championship to the Federation.  Plus, Diamond Dallas Page has stalked The Undertaker's wife, Sarah, all summer long.  Taker now has a chance to exact his vengeance in a steel cage tag team title for title match. 
[02:31:30]  Will Undertaker and Kane stay focused on the titles?  Or will their hatred for DDP and Canyon get the best of them?  WWF SummerSlam live this Sunday, 8 p.m.  Call your local pay-per-view provider to order.  Opie and Anthony, every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon, 1027-WNEW.

Getting ready to go on tour with a tour bus and everything, man.  Heavy metal comedy tour.  God damn.  He's bringing the band.  Bringing the band. 
[02:33:00]  Heavy metal comedy tour.  Heavy metal comedy.  Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer on the tour bus and the road jerking.  Junking.  Nothing but jerking.  Jim Brewer.  Talking about rock hopping.  Screaming, man.  Go to jimbrewer.com.  Yeah.  B-R-E-U-E-R.com.  Very, very good.  We have to play What Did We Learned Today?  Because there's a lot of good ones.  I'll start it off with Joe from Bayside. 
[02:33:30]  Today, I learned this one is not this one.  That one is this one.  He was here right from the start of the show.  Joe, thank you.  He's right, too.  Real quick.  Hold on.  Yes, sir.  I didn't have your mic on.  I was scared to put your mic on this segment.  This is why I absolutely love the listeners.  Everyone knows I gave out an email address.  Tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  People IM me.  This guy, fan, IMed me yesterday.  Like, yeah, you're a great comic.  And he said, you know, you really influenced me. 
[02:34:00]  I'm standing in front of an elevator.  And there's an Asian woman.  And she's pregnant.  And I really wanted to punch her in the stomach to see what would happen.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is what this guy instant messaged me.  And he said that I really influenced him.  And I just wanted to say you should have done it.  The horrible people that you are influencing, Jim.  I love it.  You're great.  Is beyond, beyond human.  One less bad driver after that good punch in the belly.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  We almost got through an entire show. 
[02:34:30]  I think Bill O'Reilly should talk to you.  This stinks.  Anthony, Steve writes, what did I learn on the show today?  Well, Boston's not a stupid city.  Opie doesn't acknowledge his last name.  And the AP is News Aids.  News Aids.  Tuttle learned, before becoming a rock star,  Marilyn Manson was a writer on Three's Company.  Let's go to the phones.  Patrick.  Hey, I learned stinky rules and sodomy.  Stinky rules.  Hey, there's a station in Detroit ripping off wow. 
[02:35:00]  That is a lot of stations.  Oh, well.  It's so funny.  Whip-em-Out Wednesday is about six years old now.  And a bunch of stations just do wow.  Other stations just change in and call, take-em-out Thursdays.  Throw-em-out Thursdays.  Throw-em-out Thursdays.  Take-em-out Tuesdays.  Or flip-em-out Fridays.  All right, seriously, guys.  Stinky's the best producer on radio.  Right on, man.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned today that if Ben Franklin was still alive, he would have a big wow sticker on 
[02:35:30]  the back of his big continental.  Word.  Big continental.  All right.  Thank you, Andy.  Stinky rules.  Epsotomy.  Let's go to John.  John, what did you learn today?  John?  Yeah, I learned they should put chlamydia in Hartford's drinking water.  Put chlamydia in there.  Thank you.  All right.  Peace.  All right.  Spanish John writes, I learned Rick held a purse hostage.  West Coast Dave, today I learned that if my wife ever catches me beating my mule, I 
[02:36:00]  should just tell her that I'm napping.  Jersey Gary, Brewer sporting his summer dew.  Nice head, dick.  And also to never argue with your wife, girlfriend while you're naked.  No.  Hold on.  Let's go.  Got to go to Philly.  Philly.  Mike, what's up?  Yo, I learned that Jim Brewer needs to get some ethanol.  He needs to get some locks in his house.  What?  Oh, needs to get some effing locks in his house.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  I learned that to beat my meat, the wife thing, but somebody already said it.  Mike, man, you had a great one.  That's the reason we went to you.  Yeah, somebody already stole it, though.  Not really.  It says, if I'm caught, say, look what you're making me do.  That's a good line right there.  I know.  I wanted to say it, but somebody ruined it.  They didn't really say it that way.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  R.P.  Opie.  Opie.  First of all, it's Philly.  Okay?  So it's been only 50 shows, and they're getting very involved in What Have We Learned, and 
[02:37:00]  you can't be too overcritical.  Okay?  Please.  Yes?  52 shows.  52 shows.  Rain man of radio.  Opie.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, today I learned that suspension really equals vacation.  You guys suck.  There you go.  Philly coming in with a good one.  Suspension does indeed equal vacation.  Yeah, the station we used to work at in Boston AF, they do fake suspensions with their jocks  and stuff.  Trying to make them seem outrageous.  So you'll notice they never go on vacation.  Like, every body in radio goes on vacation. 
[02:37:30]  But you'll notice they never say, I'm going on vacation.  They're always, I was suspended.  I don't know if I'm going to be back, but if I'm going to be back, it'll be a week from  Monday.  Whoa, I got suspended.  Because I broke into the boss's office and stole these concert tickets.  And we'll give them away twice an hour all week long.  Even though he's pissed.  And even the boss will run a promo about how I stole the tickets. 
[02:38:00]  What a tool.  Well, my new deal just came in and every year I now get three weeks suspension.  Pain.  And you know I'm right because your old partner, Birdsey, called me and told me.  We'll just, we'll keep filling people in on the fake radio you've had to endure, especially  up there in Boston, as we try to, we try to make the commute a little fun.  Keeping it real. 
[02:38:30]  What do you think?  What do you think?  Bruin talking about jacking it and getting caught by his wife is phony?  You don't make that crap up.  Hey, man, we worked on that.  What are you doing?  We worked on that script for four hours today.  Yeah.  Everyone handled it beautifully.  I passed out the scripts and everyone, you know.  You did a great job.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks.  And that call you gave me last night to make sure I got caught digging in my nose like  a four-year-old.  Yeah.  It all worked out so well.  Hey, shut up.  Everything I do is real. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, why, get back in the kitchen.  Remember the fake Chinese food call that he did?  And he called a Chinese restaurant.  And here's a little secret about what Rock Hole does over there.  He'll call up like a Chinese restaurant and just talk normally.  Hey, you got any Chinese food over there?  Oh, yes, we got Chinese food.  Yeah, you got some of that egg food, young?  Yes, we have that.  You got a cheeseburger?  No, no, nothing like that.  Okay, and then he'll cut out everything he said and add in things like, hey, Wang, you 
[02:39:30]  take it in the dumper?  Oh, yes, we do that.  So it's like, hey, I sure got Wang.  Meanwhile, it is just so phony and fake.  Is this Frank?  No, it's Rocko.  No, you sound like Frank.  Shut up.  And some of it is really bad.  It's like, so Wang, did you nail your old lady last night? 
[02:40:00]  Yes, sometimes.  So you gave her a good one?  Well, yes.  Like it won't even fit, like the tone of his voice.  You douchebag.  Big, phony, gloat.  And I had all, did Frank?  Can you hear the anger in our voices?  Yeah, we love being back.  We love being back.  We get fired in Boston.  Come back to your own stomping ground.  No one sticks up for us.  They stab us in the back.  Dude, I'll tell you.  The guy that took our slot, he never called us to say, hey, dude, you know, I'm sorry. 
[02:40:30]  He fit right in.  He stopped.  While we were really suspended, believe me, before we got fired, right before we got fired,  we were off for a week because they were hashing out who else they were going to fire along with us.  And Rocko gets in our three to seven slot and starts just running, it's Rocko, promos.  Like not even, hey, I'm sitting in for O&A.  You know, hopefully our whole anchor of the effing station will be back at some point.  You know, but I'm sitting in. 
[02:41:00]  We're pulling for them.  Yeah, I'm pulling for them.  It was still officially our show.  It's Rocko, three to seven.  Check me out.  As I stab O&A in the back, too, just like every other scumbag.  Well, you'll be exposed for the phony loser you are, and you can sink along with that station.  And Dave Dickless, Mr. Program Director Genius.  How hard is it to keep those record company relationships up when the guy that did everything, 
[02:41:30]  John Ostel in the Ozone, is gone from your station?  It must be pretty hard.  It must be hard the record companies knowing they could work a rube like you, like nothing.  So you guys are all on good terms.  The guy never called us.  Our own boss never calls.  Oh, he called once when we got suspended to tell Opie to fabricate stories to save his own ass when we got fired.  That's what we deal with.  We'll get out of here.  We'll get out of here.  How do we get on this?  He gets me fired up.  That's pretty funny, man. 
[02:42:00]  Hey, New York, listen up, man.  Brewer's in the studio.  He's going to go on a rock and roll comedy tour.  We saw like a version of this, or is it the same type of thing?  Because we saw it around.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, it's right.  It's more of the rock and stuff.  It's un-effing believable.  It's going to start the whole tour at the Vanderbilt in Plainview on Long Island, September 5th.  And we're all definitely going there to support Brewer.  We got a couple pairs of tickets to give away right now to some random callers if you call the New York number, okay?  Jim Brewer, Vanderbilt Theater, Wednesday, September 5th.  Tickets are on sale now through Ticketmaster. 
[02:42:30]  Get them fast.  They're going to sell out.  How's that for a plug, faggot?  That was a major plug, Dick.  Nice.  That was nice.  That was mint.  Have a great weekend.  We've got to get the hell out of here, Brewer.  Remember that?  Mint.  You rule.  Dude, that guy, that was mint.  Dude, get bent.  Yeah, get bent.  Let me get bent.  Good one.  Get bent.  Hey, I've got to include Boston.  You guys are wicked cool.  I'll see you in six.  You know what we do here? 
[02:43:00]  Absolutely nothing.  That's wonderful, isn't it?  You'll be an Anthony show.  1027, WNEW announces our new fall lineup.  Sports Guys Mornings, Don and Mike, Middays, Hopi and Anthony, Afternoons, Ron and Fez, Nights,  1027, WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Sam Adams.  I love it.  What do I have in my hand right now?  It's Friday, so I love having a nice beer to start off the weekend.  And what am I drinking?  Sam Adams.  It is indeed a Sam Adams. 
[02:43:30]  Let me enjoy it here for the people at home.  Oh, boy.  That is good.  That is good.  It's icy cold.  Sam, I got the lager here.  I like that.  I got the summer ale.  A bunch of beers from Sam Adams.  Jim Cook, the head of the operation over there.  He's usually drunk off his ass, but he's a genius.  He's a functional drunk.  I'll tell you that because he's been whipping up some great beer for a few years. 
[02:44:00]  Trade up for all your parties, sporting events, summer activities.  You've got to make it Sam Adams, a great American beer.  Have some pride.  Have some pride.  Fast times.  Sam Adams. </pre>
