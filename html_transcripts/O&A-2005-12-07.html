<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, dominated by the fallout from their “Assault on the Media” contest and interspersed with their typical brand of sexually explicit humor and technological discussions.  The show began with a discussion of the contest’s consequences, specifically an incident where a listener used an air horn near a Channel 7 reporter during a live broadcast. This action had drawn condemnation from the New Jersey governor, who called for prosecution, and created significant behind-the-scenes pressure from management (Eric Logan) and the media. Opie and Anthony reiterated their instructions to participants to avoid injuring anyone, expressing frustration and anxiety about the situation's escalation.  

This was followed by an extended in-studio segment with comedian Lewis, who has Tourette's Syndrome. Lewis discussed his condition, sharing a humorous anecdote about Nicole Richie’s reaction to his tics on *The Simple Life*, and promoted his children's book, *Little Timmy, The Turtle with Tourette's*.  The hosts engaged in a series of increasingly expensive bets with Lewis and Patrice O’Neal (who was a guest throughout much of the show) on how long he could remain silent.  A phone sex segment was attempted for Lewis, with a discussion of his preferences preceding the attempt.  Lewis also performed a brief stand-up routine heavily influenced by his Tourette's.  Listeners called in throughout this segment to offer opinions and support, and the hosts contemplated broadcasting from unconventional locations if their current situation worsened.

The “Assault on the Media” consequences continued to be a major focus.  The hosts discussed potential consequences, including job loss, reflecting on past controversial segments and their career history, highlighting the risks they’d taken. The conversation included numerous tangents, including a call to an escort service and discussion of a topless picture on their website. Jim Norton called in to express his concern and frustration.  Further anxieties were fueled by a report that a show employee, Elo, had been seen tampering with a car.  The hosts also discussed a planned “kidnapping” bit, an Opie and Anthony-themed Amber Alert.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to “Tissue Time,” featuring explicit phone sex between a caller, Ben, and “Wild Susan,” a phone sex worker.  Listeners called in to compare Susan's performance to a previous participant, Michelle, with some expressing preferences. Wild Susan’s website was promoted.  The segment also included discussion of Rich Voss's car accident (where he totaled his Mercedes) and speculation on the accident details.  The hosts also reflected on past firings and unsold merchandise.

Rich Vos later called in to discuss his car accident in detail, describing injuries and a newfound appreciation for life.  The conversation transitioned back to “Tissue Time,” with several callers screened, some rejected due to being in vehicles or having undesirable accents. Michelle was revealed to be naked during the phone sex.  A pre-recorded segment featuring "Tippi Tom" was played, followed by a caller correcting Anthony on a phrase used in the “Tissue Time” intro, and a graphic, sexually explicit conversation between Mike from St. Louis and Michelle.

Tech expert Leo Laporte then appeared as a guest, discussing technology, including the Sony rootkit scandal, podcasts, and his former G4 show.  He reviewed several mobile phones, including the Blackberry 8700, and discussed the gaming industry, game bugs, patches, PC versus console gaming, high-definition televisions, surround sound, the Xbox 360's launch, and software for secure data erasure.  The hosts and Laporte also discussed the PlayStation 2, original Xbox, and upcoming PS3, comparing their capabilities to PCs.  This also included a discussion about cell phones, focusing on simple, reliable models from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, and Sanyo, and different carriers.  A discussion of an expensive spy phone was also included, along with talk about MP3 players (particularly the iPod Nano) and illegal movie downloads.  The hosts mentioned plans to use audio from Laporte’s appearance on Regis Philbin in a future segment.  Throughout the tech segments, Patrice O’Neal provided comedic commentary, and Leo Laporte promoted ThisWeekInTech.com.

[00:07:00]  THE END  THE END  THE END  are that's the place to be welcome to the opian anthony program  oh fuck i i can't i can't huh i just i just can't i cannot deal with this anymore i think 
[00:07:30]  we're doing a 15 minute show today i can't no one has slept no one has read a paper no one has eaten  no one's calling uh morning patrice hey patrice how you doing man bring the funny bro bring the  funny oh well i can start with this the assault on the media contest is officially over 
[00:08:00]  it's over johnny let's just stop blaming some people let's blame somebody just blame people  blame somebody who's movie mad at that's a new tack we've never taken that one yeah just blame  who's it who is not your fault whose fault is it the assault on the media thing got out of hand  and it's officially over yeah uh the fan sites have been talking all night long 
[00:08:30]  and yes it's true the assault on the media thing is officially over oh jesus that's it no more why  should you have to explain to somebody not to bust somebody's eardrum out uh it just it always it  always follows the same track uh it starts out innocently enough uh we burn me once we do these  promotions where uh well we do the show and we have people come into the studio and we have fun and 
[00:09:00]  stuff and it's in the studio it's what we like to call the controlled environment the controlled  atmosphere right and then uh we get these ideas because we are a very interactive radio show i believe  the most interactive radio show on the radio where the listeners love to get involved with the program  and at first it's such a good idea because we spell it out and they go out and do these promotions and 
[00:09:30]  it's fun it's entertaining and uh they work well but for some reason it always goes too far  there's always go too far guy and uh we end up just getting just told with bad political timing  because you got you got the goofy new governor who's has to make a name oh my god he doesn't  have a name for himself he's not gay well no no he's not a uh he's not a uh a solidified like 
[00:10:00]  political powerhouse like the new york governor what's the new york dude uh mcgreeby well the uh  mcgreeley well the governor of new jersey has gotten involved so uh it's it's not a pretty sight  yeah once the governor gets involved i guess we gotta i guess we gotta back up to uh friday  or was it thursday i don't know i've lost track of everything i think it was i think it was last  thursday yeah i think it was last thursday there was an assault on the media wait what day did we do 
[00:10:30]  the eggnog drinking contest it was that day right so that was friday all right so friday morning  just to back up to to show you people where we were uh we're getting ready for the eggnog drinking  contest and i know phil to paul was in town and he didn't assault on the media uh he hit channel  seven again channel seven got hit with a lot of assaults on the media and he was doing like his  weather in front of um radio city music hall with the right the rockettes and no filter paul ran into 
[00:11:00]  the uh the shot like has been done you know many many times in the last year yeah um but uh i guess  the cameraman you know stepped in the way and blocked paul that's that's what that's what paul told us  anyway i honestly don't know what happened but uh bill evans you know called our our boss and uh  he was very concerned for his safety and stuff very concerned and he was scared and he has kids 
[00:11:30]  and stuff and we understand all that you know the uh promotion was never supposed to get to that point  so there was a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and uh we promised eric logan that uh  you know we would uh let the contest just kind of fade away you know yeah it's it ran its course  and uh we gave him his you know we gave him our word especially channel seven because they got hit a  lot yeah so then the weekend you know goes by and then uh monday goes by and uh you know everything's 
[00:12:00]  fine and dandy we're not talking about not talking about it we have plenty other things to talk about  and we're also trying to figure out as a show how to uh you know to to uh let the bit go away  yeah you know and then uh yesterday morning one of our uh listeners hit another channel seven  reporter oh yeah it wasn't the good part hit another channel seven reporter um the timing couldn't have 
[00:12:30]  been worse because we just gave channel seven our word that uh you know this uh this promotion was  going away not only did the this kid hit the reporter not hit you know but i mean hit me in the live  shot but he used an air horn and uh supposedly like the reporter got injured an air horn from the  air yeah the air horn that's all we know that's all we know like it was dr d david schultz and he  smacked him ruptured his whole face you know well this whole thing was supposed to be you know to get 
[00:13:00]  the uh uh name up there and have some fun making these reporters have to go through awkward moments  that was it you know sign being held up in the background uh yelling from the background and uh  if the guy wanted to have an air horn and toot it as he's walking in the background uh that was you  know their prerogative too but uh you know as we put on all the websites no one was supposed to 
[00:13:30]  uh touch interfere or injure uh anybody harm yeah that was that was uh doing the report so he did  it right up on his face i don't know we have no idea shit we haven't seen the video or anything  apparently there isn't any and supposedly they don't have video because uh it's their policy or  something when this goes on to you know to move the camera and and uh they said something like cut  cut the sound the sound or something you know that's what they did so so that happened yesterday 
[00:14:00]  we didn't acknowledge it on the air that's that's why if you were listening to yesterday's show right  at the top of the show i said something like oh no uh-oh because the the the guy that did that  assault in the media was on uh was on hold on the phone he wanted to uh call up and uh let us know  but we gave eric logan our word that we were going to move on from this promotion so we didn't touch it  we just let it sit there and then i guess uh all hell broke loose yesterday all hell broke loose  and it's getting worse because then the uh governor of new jersey got involved and the star ledger is 
[00:14:30]  reporting opian anthony fan disrupts live broadcast i'll just read this an opian anthony fan took the  radio duos assaulted the media contest literally when he sounded an air horn in the ear of wabc 7  reporter anthony johnson during a live broadcast tuesday morning in ocean township  johnson was at a hess station on route 35 shortly after 7 a.m reporting on the snowfall  when a man carrying an opian anthony bumper sticker lunged into frame wabc like most tv news operations 
[00:15:00]  has a policy against televising attention seeking stunts so the sound cut out and the camera spun away  before viewers got a chance to see or hear the air horn go off ocean township police questioned the man  whom they would not identify but no charges were filed he faces a possible assault charge if johnson  suffered hearing damage william mcfarland wabc assistant news director said he had spoken with  johnson but declined to elaborate on his condition or the station's legal plans the safety and health of 
[00:15:30]  our employees is of the utmost importance to us mcfarland said we're doing what we have to do to  make sure our employees are safe in the field so that we can serve the viewer and fulfill our license  greg opie hughes and anthony cumia host the show on xm satellite radio they were fired by wnew in 2002  after a stunt in which a couple was taped having sex in saint patrick's cathedral the duo have an  ongoing contest on their show called assault on the media where they invite listeners to disrupt live 
[00:16:00]  tv broadcast by waving signs stickers or other opie anthony paraphernalia their website foundrymusic.com  contains a list of rules for the game including and this is in big letters do not touch the reporters  you're trying to promote a radio show not injure somebody and don't pick fights with producers  and don't get nasty with anyone this appears to be the unfortunate and irresponsible act of an  individual xm official said in a statement we do not condone this behavior at all meanwhile 
[00:16:30]  governor richard cody's office issued a statement of its own condemning of its own condemning the  incident encouraging fans to intervene in live news shots is inappropriate and dangerous cody said  the person who committed this act should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law  that's only part of his statement the rest of the statement's really ugly actually encouraging fans to  intervene in live news shots is inappropriate and dangerous today a fan sounded an air horn in a 
[00:17:00]  reporter's ear and this action may result in permanent hearing damage for the reporter who was harassed  reporters are professionals who provide a great service to the public by delivering news  they should be treated with respect and not antagonized as part of a radio show gag i won't  tolerate anything less in our state the person who committed this act should be prosecuted to the  fullest extent of the law i wish mr johnson a speedy and healthy recovery well he's a black reporter  he might let this die he's not if he's not damaged he's not going to pretend he's damaged  you understand what i'm saying you know that yeah black guys don't do that no no no no i'm telling you 
[00:17:30]  when now he's not going to go if his if his ear he's just going to go ah fuck it man it's cool man it's  cool they was fucking around if it's a white anthony johnson he might go uh you know the whole oh god you  know my inner you know my third inner lobe or whatever the fuck is in your ear or whatever you know  well i guess we'll see yeah because uh worry about it fellas i've uh you've been through this uh too  many times i have no clue how it works out so this is a bad this is a bad gut here for you oh yeah this 
[00:18:00]  is not a good one of those again like oh boy oh boy have you ever had this feeling and it did and it  worked out okay this particular feeling that you guys are exhibiting right now no it has never worked  that okay with this feeling that you both have right now feeling right now no no no always a  disaster so you had this feeling evidently with last time you had this feeling and for the newbies 
[00:18:30]  like that do this type of radio you know you do something really crazy and then and everyone's  talking behind the scenes right after the show where you did this crazy thing let's say and then  the next day you're on the air so as a newbie oh how newbies are like oh look look we're going to  be fine we're on the air the next day oh they'd have pulled us off if it was that already that was  but no it's called the they're figuring it out day where you're on the air and with the with 
[00:19:00]  the new situation absolutely oh absolutely same exact feeling you have right now yeah and the same  exact feeling with uh with uh manino you know up there in boston same uh feeling yeah and that was  easy and this now this is the third feeling you've had like this absolutely third time and the the  crazy thing is like uh eric logan our boss he's usually up at this time and he's not really talking to us  this morning so that scares the shit out of me he's not really talking well because he's a supporter so 
[00:19:30]  he's probably getting pressure from somebody eric is trying to figure out how to get it right for  you guys well that's what day two is that's what the second day when you're on the air and the newbie  thinks that everything's cool because you're on the air that's actually the day that behind the scenes  all hell is breaking loose yeah you got your supporters and meetings and they're going back  and forth and then you know you know what they're doing they're typing up numbers then you get the  typing up numbers they're typing up seeing what kind of money you guys are making and potentially 
[00:20:00]  going to make and and that's it the last time it was the catholic church let's be honest here  right now it's a new goofy governor who's trying to say things like prosecute the air horn guy  if he's been in the game long enough he wouldn't even bother by saying that that's just something  he's trying to do to get some type of new like okay i'm the i'm the gangster in town this is the  mayor or the governor that is leaving no oh this is the guy that's going yeah he's the guy that's 
[00:20:30]  kind of in there until one gets in right is that when i'm governor cody i don't know cody's the guy  that just got him and he's the guy right he's the guy that just got voted in right he's the replacement  nah is he derek do you know he was the replacement for uh yeah he's like the replacement guy yeah  yeah acting governor so who's the new mcgovern is the new i live in jersey i don't even know this  shit man i'm a mess he's the acting uh governor so he's out of here as soon as the other one gets 
[00:21:00]  gets inaugurated at some point yeah okay so look man he needs to say something you know i mean he  needs to make make it make a little uh a little noise never had the governor make a statement  that's not that had the mayor we've had mayors mayors make statements yeah the mayors are usually the  ones making statements yeah julian on our behalf but i mean they're just bored anthony johnson is not  gonna make a big deal out of this his ears okay this one guy you gotta stop blaming the head we 
[00:21:30]  gotta start throwing this this air horn guy under the bus right now throw the air horn guy under the  bus listen it was amazing because we were deconstructing the the whole promotion and we  told abc yeah don't worry about it you know it won't happen again and uh and then it happened go  back on your word and then no i know we we didn't encourage it but you know unfortunately you  know we have an assault on the media yesterday and it's uh it's channel seven yeah oh boy so that's  that's where we're at and uh i don't know getting a lot of good luck bros none of us have slept uh 
[00:22:00]  i don't know i don't know we're looking i think uh elo is setting up uh we're gonna have a pie  throwing thing where people throw pies in our face for any of you hardcore old-time listeners let's say  hi to heather new jersey heather heather hey guys how are you hey heather i just wanted to say that  i saw the the assault yesterday and the guy didn't have the the air horn anywhere near the reporter's 
[00:22:30]  ear right it was down by his his side so if anything he heard it just as loudly as the reporter did  that doesn't really matter well i'm hoping the uh the reporter's fine that's for sure because that  wasn't uh you know was it a black reporter wasn't what we were uh trying to accomplish to actually  hurt someone physically i don't know i don't know anything about it we tried to stress in the rules of  this thing anytime it came up that that is not what this was all about but it just oh it's any time 
[00:23:00]  anytime we give any type of uh liberties to the listeners out creative license yeah anytime the  the show leaves this studio and goes elsewhere and a listener is the one that's kind of running the  show at that point uh figuratively speaking it just never ends up good at the beginning it's fine 
[00:23:30]  it's all fun and games everyone's happy about it even management things like that and then it just  hits a point where someone will just fuck it up and we're sitting here in the studio and uh it's out  of our hands you know yeah well good luck guys good luck bro thanks heather see you all right  let's say hi to larry in philly larry what's up yo guys i was calling to talk about lou uh the  Tourette syndrome guy but this is all fucked up yeah yeah we found a great new guy yesterday too 
[00:24:00]  man oh he was hilarious louis was hilarious i got so many phone calls about that as well yesterday  dude i nearly crashed my car on the way to volleyball yeah we should just play uh louis from yesterday  until we get a call from eric logan yes hey real quick um i think this guy's full of shit i think  they're they're picking it up uh with the the whole ear hurting thing just to  ways to think about you guys well what happened was i mean wabc is so pissed it's not even funny 
[00:24:30]  they got hit so many times with this assault on the media thing i don't know why they got hit the  most maybe they have more reporters out on the street than anyone i don't know but time and time  again they were getting hit and hit and hit and hit and then uh it blew up you know uh late last week  with bill evans the weather guy and uh you know then it was obvious we had to stop this promotion  because it was just completely spinning out of control and uh you know we were figuring out the  best way to just unravel the whole thing and then um you know it's just unbelievable the timing 
[00:25:00]  yesterday that it happens to wabc again it was again awful timing so i even if you wanted to say  hey everybody stop we're not we're not uh condoning this anymore it's all with solid media yeah  there's gonna be 85 assholes that still do it no still they'll honestly they're not gonna do it  they won't do it no they will not do it the assault on the media contest is over it trust me on this  one is over there's no choice in the matter it's just done we were watching uh the news this morning

[00:26:00]  make a new plan what's the new plan fellas the new plan in case in case this blows up what's the  next place new plan i gotta tell you i love howard stern  i think he's a brilliant broadcaster  to be part of that team would be an honor  i'm willing to admit he's invented everything  there gotta be someplace where you know yeah look this is some third world countries that don't have

[00:30:00]  xm's not really that stupid to fucking fire you guys right  i mean  i don't know  everybody who listens will cancel  it has nothing to do with stupid or anything  it's what's called business  they're trying to get marketplace so if they cancel you guys  i cancel my xm and return the one i got from my dad  and go to serious  well it's uh...  i mean this isn't like any w i mean  that shit's free  this is not a subscription 
[00:30:30]  it's not it's it truly  well well anthony you know  absorbers absorb that point there  i will absorb that  absorb that point that the listeners have power in this situation right now  the listeners have power in this situation right now  just this is what i'm saying  if you just  just  fucking get one  one just  pull that one bit of italian anger out right now right  i'm uh... i'm done to beaten  you just hold the anger  you really are so attached to entitled white people right now that you just 
[00:31:00]  think how they think  well if i was him i'd get rid of me too  but listen  the dude is saying that he'll throw his xm radio out the window  if  if you guys leave and he has that power it's actually power  because he pays for this shit  i would love to hold my head up high  that's bullshit  i'd love to hold my head up high and start like going off  you're like a newbie going into the war man  i know  it's just it's over  i would be down with you guys  i'm right  right now i'm like uh...  this is how i'm like i'm like the oprah character in uh... the color purple 
[00:31:30]  i was all full of piss and vinegar and and feeling good and sassy  now your left eyes closed  now my left eyes closed  i got my head down and then the plate and i'm just like  yes uh...  let's just sing some slave songs now  oh  please  mm-hmm  alright chris  we shall overcome  just like a newbie 
[00:32:00]  you're right  alright  you guys know what i do  i appreciate your energy patrice  and your uh...  your optimism is fantastic  but but it's like that  i have one guys with this way we're on a second tour in the nom  yeah  you're uh... one of the replace them  i'm sorry  yeah  you got all the gear you don't need  well  yeah you just you just graduated west point and you're ready to go man  we got it  we got it i don't know you  look at us getting your backpack that you gotta just leave back at the base 
[00:32:30]  i don't have to bite me and everything  but i'm like hey man  you're all clean cut  you got your nice hair dude  look at us our hair's a little longer  you can see the drugs are taking over our eyes  oh you got the thousand yard stare  i don't have the thousand yard stare yet  oh shit  we've seen it all bro  we've seen so many people go down  it's just  we've seen it all  oh no  and i don't know  i'm a cherry  here's the problem patrice  what happens uh... from this point on  things tend to just spin out of control  out of everyone's control 
[00:33:00]  the snowball effect  you know  and it all depends on  how  how deep the snow is  how steep the hill is  and how big the snowball gets  that's right  because uh...  the media can really push that thing down the hill  and then when it gets big enough  it hits a little cottage at the bottom called the o and a show  so they couldn't have spent it out of control before the air horn guy  they can't  they couldn't have gone 
[00:33:30]  hey these guys are interrupting the news man  okay how about instead of the air horn  somebody goes  you know what  they interrupt me right when i was giving everyone in the world  the place and the time to go to save their lives  because there's a terrorist attack  right  right when i was getting ready to say  uh... go on 116th street  there's an underground  and somebody goes  oh hey  and then fucks it up  fucks it up  they couldn't have did it then  do you understand what i'm saying  that this  it took this  it took an air horn  to possibly fuck up somebody's ears 
[00:34:00]  for this particular stunt  well  for them to decide that they can stop  we were starting  you understand  we were starting to realize that this uh... promotion was running its course  you know  because when it when it started  there really wasn't anything anyone could do about it  because it was just  holding up a sign behind  the reporter  i mean you know they got a goddamn ambient commercial that's doing the same thing now they're goofing  on you know a reporter that's standing there and the ambient guys standing behind the reporter  uh... but then they're just this escalation 
[00:34:30]  i'm gonna use the ambient defense by the way  oh is that what you're gonna use  that's what i'm saying  the ambient defense  get the ambient defense  because that's the spirit of the whole thing  and even yelling you know opie and anthony xm satellite radio  uh... the guy with the trumpet was funny  it was uh... way in the background  things like that  just to get the the name and the sign out there  but then it ends  it ends up this competition  it ended up this uh... competition  uh... that just had to escalate 
[00:35:00]  into something we never wanted uh...  we never wanted to happen  so if  like say if it didn't  say if they had just kept holding the signs up  yeah  okay  and the media  and the media didn't like it  i mean they couldn't have liked it anyway  at any point in time  well that was the original spirit of the thing  and yeah that would have been fine  i mean you know  a sign is being held up in the background  people uh...  but they don't have a sexual human anyway  they throw up gang signs in the background sometimes  you see that shit going on 
[00:35:30]  and you know that's fine  but  uh... you know when it gets to the point now  where uh... a reporter uh... is saying that he's injured  and things like that  that  that's what we put in the rules  to keep shit from like uh... from that happening  uh... we gotta take a break  opi you've uh... had a meeting  we gotta take a break  all right  we gotta take a break  let's take a break  um... this is what's gonna happen  we're gonna take a break  we got patrice o'neill in studio  uh...  uh...

[00:37:30]  yeah  i'm just going to reference this  huh?  wait get on mic bro  what do you got?  it's a book  you got a book?  it's my children's book it just came out with  oh that's right you were telling us that you have a children's book  ooh  yeah  little twitching timmy the turtle with tourette's  awww  holy crap  what page is good to read real fast?  the bio page  the bio page?  the bio page  where's the bio page? 
[00:38:00]  it's in the back  why is that a good page to read?  because it's about me  you got any other copies?  no we'll talk to you  here here  we'll talk to you  let's see  we don't have to read about it  it's a cute kids book you know  it explains what tourette's is  yeah  you illustrated it too  what kind of tourette's do you have?  well you know what  there's not really like class A, class B types of tourette's  there isn't a diabetes  mine I was diagnosed when I was seven  so it's just you know  I can have you know  be flipping out cursing doing one moment  and then the next it can be so subtle  that you wouldn't know I have it  you got the cursing too? 
[00:38:30]  you got the cursing too?  I do that occasionally  I more have the like the gruntal tics  and like the you know  facial twitching and all that stuff  and you know it's tough  but what the fuck  I gotta live with it though  so what do you say  what do you say before this  before you learn swears at seven  what are you saying at seven  during the tourette's  you know what I'm saying?  well when I was seven years old  my parents had noticed that  I was making the vocal tics first  that was the first thing  I didn't do the cursing  that's the way they do  smack in the head  knock it off  fucking look like a retard  knock it off  that was the cure for everything 
[00:39:00]  like that  sometimes it worked  and sometimes it did  and he has steaming confidence  for a tourette's guy  hell yeah he does  he's just  he really is a finger  air finger gun guy  thank god  because I hate when people  come in  and you're not supposed to  acknowledge it  and it's like  alright  everyone's looking at each other  like what the fuck is he doing  growing up I always tried to hide it  but you know  eventually that  you know I was like  screw this  I have this  I'm gonna fucking deal with it  I'm twenty years old now  and I'm still living with this  you got a girlfriend?  well my sex life is good 
[00:39:30]  but I don't have a girlfriend right now  what's your sex life good?  you're getting pussy  well it's like  I'm like a lady's personal vibrator  you know  especially when my mouth ticks around  oh it just has to tick a little bit  oh yeah  yeah but that's  back end  what's the front end  what's the game  what's the game  what's the game  what's the game  when a girl looks at you and goes  um  ok alright alright  half of your face is down low  and you're swearing at me  hello  you know I really don't talk about this  but to be honest with you  when you know I meet a chick 
[00:40:00]  I just gotta have confidence  and my Tourettes are bound to happen  so I play it up when it does  and usually I go for the sympathy angle  and it usually works pretty good  what does Tourettes mean?  like where did they get that word?  to be honest with you  I don't know the definition  but it derived from the name of whoever discovered it  was the guy Tourette?  something like that  something like that  I thought it was from the gun  from the rapid fire swearing  shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit  by the way  by the way  no one's ever shooting this guy  what are you  oh yeah 
[00:40:30]  that's a rough target man  that's a rough target  no well I was thinking more  this guy has all the expressions  he's no fish  yeah  oh yeah  the eyebrows are gone  it's funny because  I know his face is everywhere  that's all  oh now women  that's why women want me to go down on him  it's awesome  but you know there's different types of tits  I'm a thinking man  yeah  well that's what we call  we call them tics  like tics  that's a classification of what they are  like I have this one tic where I can be 
[00:41:00]  raving my hand up and down  constantly in the air  I can't even go to fucking auctions anymore because of it  you know  oh there we go  alright there's a joke  nah he's so  I like this  he's fucking  cause who the hell does go to auctions  the disabled made it funny  there you go  but that's but that's just  I'm saying when you go to get some ass man  that  that mo  that five or ten minutes that you have to like  get a girl hooked into you man  yeah  and you start doing this  that's a lot over time  it's like  Tourette's is one of those diseases  that you don't believe someone has  exactly 
[00:41:30]  when you're talking to a girl you're like  that fuck face  and she's like  um  what  it's like hey baby I got Tourette's  yeah right Mr. Sarcastic  people say that to me all the time  they're like you have Tourette  prove it do some Tourette  that's what I hear all the fucking time  do some Tourette  it's like me going  exactly it's like me going up to a model  saying if you're a model then prove it  eat something and throw it up  right right right  it's like not something that I can actually  you know just  do on a drop of a dime  I never  I never know when it's going to happen  that was a good one  not as talking fast as it  as there techniques that help you through it  well you know what  I'm promoting a children's book 
[00:42:00]  so I won't talk about some of them  but for the most part  nicotine in cigarettes  they've done some studies that  that actually temporarily calms it down  now they're not going to give cigarettes  like 12 million  I'm not talking about addictive fucking drugs  I'm talking about  uh mental things that you do  to stop yourself from doing what you  well  it looks like  now you see how you're listening  yeah that's when the twitches start baby  that's when you talk about it a lot  like HBO just did this documentary  on kids with Tourette's  kids with Tourette's  and while watching it  you know it brought me back to my childhood 
[00:42:30]  I'm sitting here with the popcorn  popcorn's flying everywhere  because I'm twitching like a fucking nutcase  because when I think about it  it's like it's psychological  and I can't help it  I know what's going to happen  I have this one tick  where I'm fucking jumping up and down like this  I'm in Wawa  their Wawa's in Jersey  and I'm getting a pack of cigarettes  and I'm jumping up and down  and it's like  I can't help it  I have to live with this  and you know  see right now you seem very normal  when we were waiting for you to come in  man you were all over the place  but now that you're talking in front of the microphone  that's his thing  his talking  and he's very animated  if he listens  he can put that energy into his talking 
[00:43:00]  but when he's just like kinda  shh shh  you know no black man can have Tourette's  he'd be dead  and my nigga walks into 7-Eleven  going  he's jumping around  cigarettes  shoot this motherfucker  he's up to no good  obviously  he's obviously on the crack pipes  he's jumping around  clicking  clicking  no just  just stand there a minute  yeah stand there  just stand there  he can't  don't talk  don't move  let's just  just stand there  let's see if you can make 30 seconds without saying anything 
[00:43:30]  yeah he can't  or just  concentrate  there it is  look at him  now can't you just  wait  oh  god  wow that was rough  alright wait wait wait  wait wait  you have an itch  you are crying  you have an itch somewhere  and you really do  you gotta hear this thing  he's a comic  he's a comic  here's what he should do  you should dress up in a suit  so that you can pretend  that you're fixing your tie  yeah  if you like that you  all the time  and you can always be just going  I tell ya  it's crazy 
[00:44:00]  it's crazy in here  I always have ways of hiding  like growing up  that built up like a  that was too good  we gotta do that again  let's see how long it can last  well imagine when I went  from growing up in school  you know what I mean  you want to take a bet  you want to take a bet  yeah I'll take a bet  I got ten dollars  he can't not go  he can't go 30 seconds  thirty seconds  thirty  I'll give you less  thirty  he can't go fifteen seconds  without two  I'm going ten  it has to be a sound  not just a twitch  alright  a sound  I'm saying ten seconds  but when you say ten  I say fifteen 
[00:44:30]  but keep in mind  we're talking about it so much  that's what's why  that's what I'm banking on  here we go  give him a chance  alright on the ten  here we go  ten seconds  he's concentrating man  shh shh shh  he's concentrating  it's uh  seven seconds  right now  damn it  ten seconds is up  I'm out  very good  he's up  oh  damn it  fourteen seconds  damn it  Patrice just got in 
[00:45:00]  fuck out  fuck out  yes baby  I just had a picture of him in the back of my mind saying  I just had a picture of him in the back of my mind saying  We're not gonna fucking switch I'll fuck the cabin here right off  wait a minute  I got ten dollars for this motherfucker  let's go double or nothing man  double or nothing man  you know get that man that money right there man  take that money right there  take that money right there  God damn  I can't imagine  you guys are having a fucking great time  imagine what I went through in High School  how did you sit  how did you sit in class  That's some nerve-wracking  I had this one 
[00:45:30]  you know  I was in history classes one time and the history teacher was writing notes on the board  and he had just made fun of my friend.  Y'all, they try to pick out a student if they're not listening and try to embarrass them.  So this is the only time I really did it on purpose.  And I was trying to get back at the teacher for fucking with my friend.  So he's in the middle of writing notes and he keeps looking back to see if everyone's  paying attention.  And I start doing my flipper with emphysema tick, which is a real one.  It's like.  So I'm doing this the whole time.  And, you know, you've got to have fun with it. 
[00:46:00]  How can you mock your own tick?  That means like, how can you that means you should be able to control it.  But you know what?  I've been at first of all, I'm an actor.  I've only been doing stand up for about a year.  I've been acting for 12 years.  And, you know, whenever I'm on set or doing a, you know, a stage or doing stage work or  a film or whatever, it seems like I can shelf it while I'm concentrating on what it is.  Like in that same documentary HBO did, there's this one kid, he's a little 12 year old.  He's like screaming the weirdest things you can think of.  And one of them is caffeine, caffeine.  And he's just screaming this. 
[00:46:30]  And he plays the drums.  And whenever he plays the drums, it like goes away, you know?  Hey, do you have the racist Tourette's?  Because that would be so huge today, man.  Isn't there such a thing as racist Tourette's?  Well, I had a lot of black friends growing up.  So like they would, and this is funny that you say that, because they would always try  to make me do it.  They would be like, yo, you know, you got to shout the N-word.  And I just feel really uncomfortable doing that.  But they talked about it so much because they knew when I think about something, a word,  if you keep saying the word around me, eventually it can become a tip. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  So every day, they would be like this.  What's up, nigga?  How you doing, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga?  And it just clicked into my head.  And I was like, guys, stop doing this because I know you want me to say this.  And basically...  Stop it.  Stop.  You're going to force me to be racist.  I know.  You know, if they said something else, they'd catch that nigga.  He goes, porch monkey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We didn't say porch monkey, but I didn't say that.  That dude was your inspiration, our niggas. 
[00:47:30]  Cone, what?  These are the type of guys I grew up with every single day.  I love it.  That's why I make fun of him.  I feel like it's Bill Burr in Charleston, South Carolina on CNN.  He dyed his hair black.  I wonder where he's been.  All right, how about another bet?  This is too good.  Double and nothing.  Well, the listeners want to bet.  They're betting at home.  All right, look.  15 seconds is it, man.  You think he cannot?  I think the pressure's on.  Even though I lost with 10 seconds before, I'm going with 10 again.  You're going with another 10?  I'm going with 10. 
[00:48:00]  It's a shame you can't smoke in here.  That would bind me about 20 seconds.  I'm going with 18.  Because he's going to fight through 15, but he can't go past 15 seconds.  All right.  How much?  10 bucks?  10 bucks.  All right.  They're betting at home, too, man.  The answer feedback's going crazy.  Some people saying, best bet ever.  5!  12 seconds!  Wait, wait, wait.  He's stuck now.  We didn't start.  He didn't start.  He didn't start.  He didn't start.  All right, here we go.  We didn't start yet.  All right, what's the bet? 
[00:48:30]  We got money on the table.  I got 10 bucks.  All right, 10 bucks is what?  10 bucks on.  He says 10.  I say 18.  I'm giving him three more seconds.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You can tell I have a lot of dignity.  I say 10.  Are we doing Price is Right rules or just closest?  No, it's...  Ant says 10.  Patrice says 18, right?  I haven't been this nervous since I was on The Tonight Show.  I was going nuts even when I was there with my tics in the dressing room.  You were on The Tonight Show?  Yeah, I did.  I did one of those segments that...  You know how David Letterman has stupid human tricks?  Well, he has like, don't try this at home. 
[00:49:00]  And it's actually linked back to my Tourette's.  Because I was on this Tourette medicine, it made me gain a lot of weight when I was growing  up.  I had peaked at 300 pounds at 16.  Get the fuck out of here.  And I lost over 85 pounds and I ended up having all this loose skin.  So long story short, I do this trick where I can stick a wiffle ball back underneath my  loose belly skin and hit a wiffle ball with a t-ball stand without using my hands.  And I hit it to Leno on set and that was the gig I did.  That was your thing.  Do you still have the loose skin?  Unfortunately, I'm trying to get rid of it.  Do you want to see it?  Wait, how much do you weigh right now? 
[00:49:30]  Right now I weigh about...  See, I originally was 85, but I gained a few bucks.  So I'm about 230, 235.  He doesn't look 230?  Well, I have about 30 pounds of skin.  Oh, that's why.  Because you look...  He still doesn't look 230.  Oh, wow.  Whoa, get that on video.  You know, and it's sad because I don't have any insurance, so it's not like I can get  the surgery.  Why did the guy do this to him?  He's built like a bitch.  I know, it's like, what the fuck?  He already made me have fucking Tourette's and now he has me have titties.  He has Tourette's and he's built like a marshmallow.  He's built a mother.  He's built like a... 
[00:50:00]  He's built like a mother.  I'm built like a 90-year-old hooker.  A bitch with a newborn.  This is disgusting.  He's built like a 52-year-old mom with five kids.  I can't believe he has lasagna and Tourette's.  Only The Rock should have Tourette's.  He should pull up his shirt and go, I am as sexy as you can be.  I work out every fucking day.  Where's a pizza maker when you need one?  He's a lazy Tourette's.  All that shit is to have you lose at least 10 pounds a week, motherfucker. 
[00:50:30]  What is he eating?  Get some cheese and sauce.  I was sitting down on my couch right now, though.  That 18 is not good, but I'm going to stick with 18.  All right, we're going to bet again.  Here we go.  I'm my cue.  Let me get a drink of water.  What are you going with?  I'm just like the emcee here.  I'm the game show hoax.  Come on, anybody else in, dude?  Come on.  Anybody else want to do a little side bet?  Who's in, though?  What are you in for?  What are you in for?  This is some good money going back and forth.  Give me two to one on, like, 30 seconds. 
[00:51:00]  Two to one on 30?  He ain't lasting 30 seconds.  He ain't going 30 seconds.  He ain't going no 30 seconds.  All right, give him a chance.  Another thing.  If I read sometimes, reading helps me sometimes diverse it.  So you don't want me to do anything.  No, no, no, no.  We want you to just concentrate.  Just stand.  Concentrate your best.  Just stand.  There we go.  Damn, man.  Dude, there is so much betting going on around the game right now.  The feedback is going nuts.  And to think I wrote the short box for three years for nothing, this paid off.  All right, here we go.  I'm my cue, all right?  You can do whatever you want until I say go. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  Two, one, go.  Can I talk?  Uh-oh.  No.  Start it again.  Start it again.  I bet.  You can't talk.  Start it again.  You can't talk.  You've got to just be completely quiet.  On my cue, we're going to start.  You can't say shit.  We're just going to...  It's going to be silence.  Go.  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  I don't like what you're doing. 
[00:52:00]  Opie, you're counting and giving him something to concentrate on.  Yeah, listen.  All right.  I don't want to know.  No.  All right.  Anthony's a big moment.  Look, look, I was in LA.  Anthony, Anthony, you know that playing around.  Anthony's a professional better, all right?  You know that this is not fixed.  I'm going to start right now.  No, no, no, no.  Don't tell me when you're starting the timing.  No, no, no, no.  All right.  That's right.  I just think this should be complete silence.  You're right.  You're right.  You're giving him something to work on. 
[00:52:30]  Nothing.  Wow.  That was a good one.  Is that called the chainsaw?  You seem to name them.  That's called rubber lifts.  That's the workout after stretch.  All right.  All right.  Bed is back on.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I just thought it would be...  I don't know what would happen to the system if it's just dead air for a while.  So I thought it was down.  People know.  We should be all right.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  On my cue again.  And...  Wait.  He wasn't ready there.  On my cue. 
[00:53:00]  Here we go.  And...  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  What was it?  What was it?  22.  22. 
[00:53:30]  22.  Who was that?  Who fucking was that?  Who was that 30?  How was that fucking 18?  I think...  I think...  Yeah, he was closer.  Patrice...  Were we going closer?  Yeah, because I asked if we were doing Prices Right Rules  and I said no.  I thought we were doing Prices Right Rules.  No, that's why I asked for Prices Right.  Yeah, like, once he passes your time, I think you're out.  So it's him.  I think it would be him.  I asked if we were doing Prices Right Rules.  That's Prices Right Rules.  Yeah, I think it's got to be in this kind of thing.  I think it's got to be closest, man, no?  See, I was doing good, but then I...  I'm out regardless, so you two motherfuckers argue about it yourself. 
[00:54:00]  I was far away.  Here, take it.  I was actually doing pretty good the first time, but then I got a glimpse of that monkey head up there,  and that's what really, you know, aggravated it.  The monkey head freaked you out?  It's just kind of, you know, Jesus.  It's anything.  Christ, I'm telling you, that's the best shot he could possibly give.  How about one more bet?  Oh, okay.  One more, and then we'll have him do some stand-up.  This is the real deal, me and Patrice.  Yeah.  Right?  The real deal.  All right, what's the rules here?  Here's the money.  Well, no, there's 10 in there.  Okay, keep it in there.  Whose is that?  That's yours, I think. 
[00:54:30]  No, he's Patrice.  He made his 10.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, that's Patrice.  There's mine.  All right, what do we got?  All right.  Now, obviously, I got to go over 10.  Well, you have to.  The guy seems to be...  Now, based on research, 18 seems pretty good, but...  Are we going to do...  And he's working on...  I'm going to go with an even 20.  We are going closest to the number.  It doesn't matter if you go over or not.  All right.  If that seems to be the way...  I'm going to go down.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  15.  This guy...  15.  He cannot... 
[00:55:00]  This is...  He struggled at 22.  I know.  That was pain and suffering.  15.  Do we have that on video?  You know how you have, like, a big...  You got to take a big shit.  You know you do, and it just can't come out.  This little turtle head poking out, but you just can't...  That's what it feels like.  Too much going on.  You know, in my head.  He had to close his eyes that time.  I know.  I know.  I know.  He was real Tai Chi on that shit right there.  And that's it.  That's as best as he got.  Yeah, it was...  15 seconds again.  All right.  All right.  People saying best dead air ever.  Ever.  All right.  Here it is.  We're going to go now.  Me and Patrice are in. 
[00:55:30]  Patrice is saying 15.  I'm saying 20.  All right.  Okay.  He's warming up.  All right.  We're going to start this in 10 seconds.  So, get it all out.  Get it all out there, Lewis.  Whatever you need to do.  There is nothing at all.  All right.  Here we go.  It's all in there.  You can count down.  All right.  Three, two.  And go.  It was like right between 15 and 20. 
[00:56:00]  Exactly.  It was exactly between 15 and 20.  We have to go again.  I swear to God.  That was 17.5 seconds.  17.5.  I knew I had to rest people.  Holy shit.  Damn. 
[00:56:30]  This is science that we studied.  Wow.  You cannot go past it.  He's in deep shit now.  Oh, my God.  I feel like Jerry Lewis on crack.  I don't know what to think now, though.  All right.  I got to bring it down a little bit.  The money's in.  I got to bring it down a little bit.  You guys should add to the pot, man.  I'm going to go.  Add to the pot.  Come on.  Throw a little more in there.  Lewis, get it all out, bro.  Get it all out.  What do you got in there?  Put a 20.  Just take 10 back.  All right.  Take 10 back.  Here we go. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  This is...  God damn.  Oh, God.  All right.  He's boinging me.  I'm going.  You know what?  The funny thing is, when I go into clubs and I hear rap music, I end up doing it to  the beat sometimes.  All right.  I can't help it.  Here's what we got to do.  He's boinging me.  We got to flip a coin to see who's going to pick first.  Because that seems to be pretty important.  All right.  So, Opie, if you flip this corner.  Here we go. 
[00:57:30]  I can't believe it.  Not this.  All right.  Who's calling it?  Tails.  Heads.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Anthony's got the time.  All right.  I'm saying 16 seconds.  16 seconds.  Now, this is the closest.  Closest.  Closest.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  That last one was dead center, man.  I was ready to give Anthony the title.  It was totally tied. 
[00:58:00]  21.  21.  All right.  He's got some balls here.  He's getting tired.  He's boinging me.  He's tired of a Turet's world.  All right.  Here we go.  I say 16.  16.  He says 21.  How much is in the pot?  There's 40 bucks in here now.  All right.  Here we go.  One second.  One second.  All right.  He's getting a little drink of water.  He's getting water.  Join in a little second.  Do your thing, man.  This is all the Turet's kids. 
[00:58:30]  The book is going to show that you have self-control.  All right.  All right.  This is for Little Twitching Timmy.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  What's the name of the book again?  Little Twitching Timmy.  The Turtle with Turet.  You can take a look at it at my website, laughterbyloo.com.  Laughterbyloo.  Laughterbyloo.  That's spelled L-O-U.  Laughterbyloo.com.  Boing.  All right.  I'm telling you, baby.  Boing means victory, baby.  It's close to bingo.  It's like you guys are talking about it so much.  You have all these pictures on the wall.  It's like.  That's what I'm banking on. 
[00:59:00]  Anthony, you're so.  Well, no.  I think Anthony's not fucked.  I think Patrice is fucked.  I think Patrice is fucked.  All right.  Here's the deal.  All right.  Here we go.  Anthony says he'll last 16 seconds.  Patrice says he'll last 21 seconds.  21.  Go ahead.  Get him, Tommy.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm IQ.  We're just waiting for the hand to hit six.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it. 
[00:59:30]  Patrice wins.  Wow.  What did I tell you, baby?  God damn.  You take it away, brother.  You fucking money, baby.  You, Aaron Square, legit.  Give me that, baby.  Wow. 
[01:00:00]  Wow.  He was holding that in.  And there's just a little.  When it passed 16, I'm like, damn, come on.  Good job, man.  We've got to share this, baby.  He's so proud, right?  Oh, wow.  That was, I think that was 26 seconds of your keeping track at home.  Wow.  There you go, man.  I'll buy a couple packs of cigarettes.  See you think.  Dave from Atlanta.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, man, I've been listening to the bits for five minutes, just turned on the radio.  Well, what are you guys doing?  Oh, you're going to have to listen to the replay.  Yeah, we're just betting. 
[01:00:30]  We're betting on how long this Tourette's guy could stay silent before he twitches in.  Guys, guys, call me Twitchels.  It's actually funny because Nicole Richie.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was on the Simple Life with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.  And that was the whole premise of the scene, you know, I was on the bus with them.  They were on the Greyhound bus.  And my Tourette's are acting up.  And Nicole Richie jumps up on my lap, gives me a big hug, tries to calm me down, and calls  me Twitchels.  And she's the one that nicknamed me.  So I go by Twitchels, you know, whenever I do stuff like this. 
[01:01:00]  God bless them.  Yeah, God bless them.  God bless them.  God bless them.  We can walk.  We go all over the world making money.  Don't you feel a lot better about yourself when you, like, see this?  I don't feel a lot better about myself.  I got an idea.  Louis should do a stand-up.  We got about 15 people in the studio.  And I'm thinking, Anthony, that we should have a little tissue time.  We get a girl to talk dirty to Louis and we tie the two brand new bits together. 
[01:01:30]  Certainly.  We need a girl that's really good at talking dirty and is able to do a little phone sec.  Can I tell you what type of women I like?  Would that help?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.  Certainly.  Okay.  What do you...  Oh, right now?  Yeah, what do you dig on?  You know, for some reason, I don't know what it is, but it always, it gets to me.  I like black women.  And when they talk angry, it kind of...  I don't know if it's a turn-on, but I might...  I know black women.  I don't know.  I just always like... 
[01:02:00]  Five minutes.  Sweetie, I don't know what the fuck Tourette's is.  See, I love that.  But the next time you call me a nigga by mistake, I know I got a cousin named Tourette's, but...  By the way...  I don't know what it means and shit.  Damn.  Please, guys, realize that I was coaxed by my home dogs to do that.  I was coaxed by them.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to walk out of the studio and get fucking shot. 
[01:02:30]  Nah.  Oh, no, I won't.  Right.  No, you won't.  We learned that.  I like that one.  All right, we need a girl that is good at talking dirty to call the show immediately.  Could be the best fit ever.  That's not one I've had since I was about 14.  All right.  Jump and take.  How about we get Lewis to do some stand-up, okay?  You want the lights turned down a little bit?  What do you...  Whatever you got to do.  Yeah, make it more club atmosphere.  Here, turn that down a little bit.  There we go.  A little bit.  And the children's book.  Come on.  We got to get the plugs out.  Oh, yeah.  Well, basically, I just came out with a children's book a couple months ago called Little Twitching 
[01:03:00]  Timmy, The Turtle with Tourette's, and it's a fully color-illustrated children's book.  I wrote and illustrated it.  Trafford is the published company that you guys can check it out at Trafford.com or LaughterbyLew.com.  Boom!  And another...  Or you could call it...  You could...  Or it's a great book.  You know, if you want one of your kids.  You should have a man plugging everybody's shit.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  And I'll be over at the Westbury Music Fair.  It's Patrice.  So now I'll be at Caroline's next week. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, jeez.  Now, you guys got me so fucking worked up.  When I do a show, I usually smoke a bunch of cigarettes, get in my zone.  But now I've been, you know, you're a toy for 15 minutes.  Exactly.  So let's...  I love it, though.  I've got to calm down, though.  How many minutes do you want to do?  A couple minutes?  I'll just do a couple...  A little few materials.  All right.  So, whatever you want to do.  But, you know, usually what I say is, you know, people always ask me, they say, you know,  what's Chourette's?  What is...  Wait, are you starting your act?  Are you interrupting it? 
[01:04:00]  I thought you said start the act, Spider.  I thought you said start the act, Spider.  I thought you said start the act, Spider.  This is the act.  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:30]  Get right into it.  It ain't no shit.  Oh, God bless him.  They're going to give you the big intro on everything.  Man, don't turn on him, you bastard.  God damn.  Oh, my God.  Guys, it works right into it.  And it was so, like, spontaneous.  And Opie just trampled him.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Oh, for the...  You know, I...  I'm here.  I fucking do it again.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  It's Louis the comic with Chourette's, everybody. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You know, what I was, you know, what I was starting to say was, you know, people always  ask me, you know, what's Chourette's like and, you know, what is it?  And I always, you know, start off, I want to explain what Chourette's is.  And in a nutshell, basically, it's this disorder that calls people a twitch, grunt, curse, and  they can't control it.  In my case, I have one of my big ones is where I constantly jerk my head back and forth.  That's one that I do every so often.  And when I do that, what are you pointing to? 
[01:05:30]  Watching TV.  So, basically, I'm a Japanese tourist.  We're a nightmare.  But besides the point, fuck you, I have Chourette's.  I'm sorry.  We don't want you going away in an ambulance and making an ambulance sound yourself.  Yeah, you almost cracked your head on the TV, so we all got nervous.  Thank you, guys.  We were worried about your safety.  We weren't ready to laugh there because we thought you were going to crack your skull.  Well, thank you for caring.  Fuck you.  Ambulance is here. 
[01:06:00]  For those of you who are just...  All right, here we go.  Back to Lewis the comic with Tourette's, everyone.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Okay, I'm good now.  I'm good.  You know, for those of you just tuning in, if you missed it, one of my tics that I like  the most is when I'm raising my hand up and down, constantly in the air, and I just can't  control it, which fucks me out of going to auctions.  I could never go there.  So, laugh. 
[01:06:30]  But we heard that one.  I know.  For those of you just tuning in...  All right.  Oh, my God.  That was probably...  You guys fucked me up today.  Oh, my God.  You guys...  Oh, my God.  That's actually him.  That's him.  Look, look, look.  I don't...  Look, look.  You guys have got me so worked up.  I don't want to...  I don't want to do this.  You guys got me so worked up.  What I do want to do is I want to ask you...  Just ask me what... 
[01:07:00]  You know, ask me anything you want.  You know, I want to talk to you about it.  Because the reason why I'm doing this, I want to spread awareness.  I want to spread awareness, guys, you know.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Anyway.  Yeah, someone wants to know if your children's book is available on tape.  Oh, my God.  You just reminded me.  They want me to do an audio version of me.  Yes, fuck on tape.  See, Jane.  What?  What?  Jane's a whore. 
[01:07:30]  Little switching to me was just as normal as you.  Fuck off.  Ow, ow.  Oh, it hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  There's so many people calling right now.  We can't get the lines free.  We're trying to get the lines free so a girl calls in to do the phone sex thing.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait.  And just to let you guys know, you know, there's not a lot of people who are raps or raps.  Wow, that's some sound. 
[01:08:00]  Meet George Desson.  Fucker.  Oh, my God.  Hi, you know, I met a man on the street the other day.  He said he hadn't had a bite in weeks.  What'd you do?  That's the smartest thing I've ever heard.  Let me go home and eat a roll cookie dough.  We're watching Go to Girl Rewind right now.  You make me hate myself.  No.  But I love you guys.  It's cool. 
[01:08:30]  But I was saying, there's only one famous person that, to my knowledge, other than Ned  Campbell's brother, who really isn't famous, that has tress.  You guys know the Philadelphia Phillies.  I don't know if you know, 1993, around there, a player by the name of Jim Eisenreich.  He went to the World Series with them.  He had tress.  And that's why I wear my Phillies cap wherever I go.  It's kind of like a reminder of how fucked up I am.  Wow.  Wow.  Look, you are exhausted.  You are exhausted. 
[01:09:00]  You all right, Luke?  Oh, no.  I have fun with this.  It takes a lot of...  God bless you, man.  God bless you.  It takes a lot out of me.  It just looks exhausted.  The next time we do some kind of live event, you've got to be there, man.  God bless you, man.  I'll be more than happy to show up.  Thank you.  You are constantly working.  I'm sure you want to please make this guy some type of celebrity, please.  Absolutely.  Can you please?  Doesn't it seem like it's constantly like you're jogging all the time?  He can't shut up.  No.  If he does not stop, he's going to do it. 
[01:09:30]  So he has to just go and go.  Do you twitch in your sleep?  Go.  You know what?  That is a funny thing.  I never knew, so I decided to tape myself one night.  And, you know, this is a true story.  I wasn't ticking throughout the whole night.  And the tape only lasted like two hours or so.  So I could have.  But I started to feel myself while I'm sleeping.  And I started to do this, going up and down.  And I didn't know if that was a tick or if I was just in a dream.  But to my knowledge, I never really know if I'm actually.  You don't make sounds or anything? 
[01:10:00]  I'm sleeping.  I don't know.  I wouldn't know.  But on the tape, you didn't make any sounds?  Oh, no.  Just like the turn over.  And how do you get to sleep?  You know what?  One of the things that I always say is if my ticks are so bad,  the one thing I like to do, I like to.  Oh.  Gee.  Guys.  So, maybe it's dice with Tourette's.  I'm at this, I'm at the bank.  And it's chicks online at the beginning. 
[01:10:30]  I sound like an old Jewish guy with hemorrhage.  Here I am.  So, I'm banging this broad in the ass.  And she's like, a gig.  Oh.  Oh.  A drama.  Oh, and the interjection sound.  Oh, my God.  Hickory dickory dog.  This chick.  Jack be nimble.  Jack be quick. 
[01:11:00]  Hello, sir. Welcome to McDonald's. What can I do for order food?  Oh, wow. Dennis from Whackbag. This guy sounds like a lost member of the Three Stooges.  Oh, you know, talking about...  I think you scared the women away because they're not calling for the phone sex thing.  Oh, you know what was funny? Talk about the simple one.  A few months after that, Nicole Richie was on Letterman, and she talked about me on Letterman, about having Tourette's. 
[01:11:30]  She didn't remember my name, but she just referred to me as Twitchell's.  Bitch.  And I thought, yeah, mm-hmm.  So anyway...  How about...  So two weeks ago...  He has complete access to all his noises that he can do on purpose and by mistake.  A repertoire.  So he can just go brr and brr at the same time.  He can't control in any control at the same time.  Patrice, it was funny because she did a book signing in New York.  Two weeks...  I can't look at you now. 
[01:12:00]  She did a book signing...  What you calling me?  ...two weeks ago.  It's a book signing.  I just want to die.  So, two weeks ago, Nicole Richie did a book signing at Virgin Megastore.  And I went to go see her, not only to get a copy of her, but to give her a copy of mine.  But to continue your stalking of her, obviously.  No, the first time I saw her since we did it a year ago.  Shot the episode.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway.  So what we did was...  Sorry, I'm so fucking nervous now. 
[01:12:30]  Okay.  So she jumped up and she yelled Twitchell.  She remembered to instantly give me a big hug.  And that's a good feeling that people remember me.  But you know what the whole point is?  You know, I'm living my life.  I'm doing what I have to do.  And anyone who has Tourette's Syndrome, they shouldn't, you know, go into studios and try to be quiet for 15, 20 seconds.  No, no.  No, they really should just have fun and try to do whatever they want to do.  You know, my teacher, when I was in about 7th or 8th grade, looked at me, did not believe.  He did not believe.  He's just got to keep talking. 
[01:13:00]  The next time he's here, this is the bit, not silence.  It's how many within a span of...  You keep track.  It's my keep track.  Oh, that's a good one.  Within a span of five minutes of him talking.  Wow.  How many...  Do me a favor.  Don't remind me about that.  Because I don't want to be thinking about it.  So it's fair.  Don't remind me that you're going to do that.  Oh, it wouldn't matter anyway, motherfuckers.  No.  As you try to concentrate.  And anyway, when I was a teacher, blah.  He wants to be doing it now.  He's telling a heartfelt story.  When I was a child, someone called me... 
[01:13:30]  My teacher in 7th grade, basically, she told me, she said, listen, Louis, you cut it out.  And I was having an outburst.  And she looked at me and said, you don't have Tourette's.  You don't have it.  It's made up.  It's a lie.  And that's why I'm trying to...  You know, I'm not getting all mushy, but that's why I'm trying to spread awareness.  Because people still don't believe.  It's...  You know, not all people, but most people find it hard to believe that it's a real disorder.  And it is a neurological disorder.  And, you know, that's why I'm writing this book.  That's why I'm trying to get the word out there.  And I've actually finished a screenplay, which I haven't, you know... 
[01:14:00]  It really is an unfair disease.  But I have some people attached to it.  And I want to spread the word.  Good afternoon.  Hi, I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:14:30]  I have Tourette's Syndrome.  Mm-hmm.  Which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred...  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit.  Because all the ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a...  A guy with a...  That's no problem, hon. 
[01:15:00]  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Oh, okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone. 
[01:15:30]  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy,  I could get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Oh, is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take for the fees, for the fees, for the fees, for the fees?  A mess card?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine. 
[01:16:00]  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  High up...  Jungle fever?  Do you have any...  Black girls? 
[01:16:30]  We have black ladies, we have Asian ladies, we have Oriental ladies, it just depends.  I have to go now, because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once, and it made me...  Goodbye, okay?  But wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:17:00]  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze the bread.  Squeeze the bread.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hard piece of air.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive...  Yeah.  ...that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result.  The Opium Infantry Show!  In case you didn't know...  And we're back with the Opium Infantry Program. 
[01:17:30]  Hey.  The one virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Ooh.  A lot of people are very, very confused right now, I know.  I was going to trip them all up and say, ooh, it's hot today, hot day today, hot summer day.  Let them think it's best of.  No.  We're back after an extended break.  First one of those we've had to do in quite some time. 
[01:18:00]  Correct, Anthony, correct.  Phone calls.  Anyway, where are we?  There's a lot of people just waking up right now.  We got ourselves in a bit of a quandary with this Assault in the Media contest that is now officially over.  Done, Steve?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely done.  It went to a place that wasn't intended.  Kind of liked the way it was when it first started. 
[01:18:30]  Everyone did.  I mean, we didn't see any problems in it.  Any dangers in it.  It's just a holding up sign.  And then they started playing the top of this game with each other, I guess, and got out of hand.  So now, look.  Now it's got to stop.  Thank you very much.  And it's over.  And it's over, Johnny.  Yeah, we got a governor involved.  Hey, governor.  The governor of New Jersey's involved. 
[01:19:00]  How did he get involved?  I have no idea.  Where's the chain of command that goes from the news to the news guy to the news office to the governor?  I have no idea.  But a reporter was injured by an air horn.  That's all we know right now.  Yeah.  And the governor got involved.  He's very pissed off.  ABC TV's very pissed off.  Yeah.  Our company's very pissed off at us. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  So here we sit.  Do you think somebody's up there saying that you guys are the Terrell Owens of radio?  Of course.  We just, you know, and I got to be honest.  We don't try to do this shit.  Like, people call us out all the time.  Look at what I got to read.  I call Bravo Sierra.  It's a fake suspension in the works.  Don't insult my intelligence with this fake thing. 
[01:20:00]  Dude, I want you to come down here, and after we just punch you in the face a few times,  I want to throw you in an office so you can listen to some of the fucking phone calls we've been sitting through.  So you can listen to some of the fake phone calls.  And then tell me.  Maybe when you're working at the deli fucking counter or the gas station, shithead,  you don't get suspended for stuff.  You just get fired for dipping into the till and stealing the cigarette money.  But I can assure you that the emotions that we're feeling and felt since we got on the show this morning are authentic. 
[01:20:30]  The lack of sleep I got last night was based on the previous times this has happened to us.  And it isn't some wacky fucking radio bit, jerk off.  And if I didn't ban you from instant feedback, I'd mention your name,  but I don't have to look at another one of your snide bullshit comments.  Because you're done.  You're done. 
[01:21:00]  Your input on the show, your input on this program, sir, is finished.  It's done.  You will now no longer ever have a say on the Opie and Anthony show.  Happy?  You know, you should have the right to say, yeah, maybe you should.  Not in country, Anthony.  This is Anthony country instant feedback.  This is my nation right here.  I exile motherfuckers.  I downright kill people on this thing.  President Anthony, you have a boogie on your nose.  You're gone.  Gone.  Click.  Clam. 
[01:21:30]  Click.  The emperor has boogies.  That's it.  And I don't have to put up with shit like that.  You know what it's like?  Is the governor of New Jersey in on the cute radio bit?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what it is.  With the cute fake suspension?  It's these assholes, man.  It's like taking a fucking beating and then going into a room just black and blued and  bleeding.  And some guy goes, you know, you fucking bullshit, man.  No one touched you.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Wait.  Well, I'm not putting up with any of that crap.  Well, here's the deal.  We just talked to Eric Logan.  That's why he had to sit through a 40-minute bit there.  It was a great bit, though, from yesterday.  A lot of people haven't heard that yet.  We'll see them to enjoy it.  The instant feedback in between, hey, what the fuck's going on?  There was others going, wow, this is really funny.  Yeah.  Because there are people out there that have no fucking clue and they're just listening  to the radio, you know, because they could care less.  And they're laughing along because that bit was funny, but they don't know why we were  playing that bit. 
[01:22:30]  And they could care less.  Yeah.  They're at work right now in their cubicle.  All they know is they tuned in the radio, heard something they haven't heard, laughed  really hard, turned off their XM and their car, went into work.  Right.  No idea.  Not a clue.  Most people listen to radio for, what, 20 minutes a day.  Yeah.  So a lot of people have heard that 20 minutes and will never know what's going on.  They will have no clue.  Yeah.  So we had to play that because Eric Logan wanted to talk to us.  And he's telling us, trust me, you guys will be just fine. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Now a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed newcomer to the game like me would go, oh, okay.  Yeah.  Do you see that?  But I have a funny feeling that old-school gangsters like yourself see something different.  We've heard it.  This is the first time we're actually doing a radio show with our coats on.  We have our coats on.  The staff is a little disturbed.  I noticed that.  I was going to take mine off.  You might want to keep your coat on.  But it has nothing to do with cold, right?  You might want to keep your coat on. 
[01:23:30]  The staff was a little disturbed when they saw us put our coats on in the office while  we were taking our conference call with Elo.  Look, here's the deal.  We will fight this.  We know that we do a very, very good radio show.  We know we have a huge fan base.  And we'll get through this.  You know?  Elo's saying we're going to be fine.  And no single bit is the show.  So, you know, obviously we'll come up with something else.  We always do.  It's just these things happen. 
[01:24:00]  And in order for us to keep broadcasting to you, the faithful fans, we can no longer do  the assault on the media.  Got out of control.  Well, you know, it was running its course.  It's okay.  I was telling Eric Logan last night when I was talking to him, I'm like, you know, there  are times in our career, Anthony and I will come up with this great bit or whatever, and  all of a sudden, you know, management gets really scared and pulls it right away.  And as a broadcaster and as someone that comes up with this stuff, this creative crap, you 
[01:24:30]  get really bummed because you think about the possibilities in your head.  Like, wow, we could have a lot of fun with this on the radio.  It'll create talk, blah, blah, blah.  And then when it's pulled before it ever has the chance to grow, you get really, really  bummed out because you wonder what the possibility would have been or could have been.  With this bit, we were able to, you know, take it as far as we could possibly take it.  I even told Anthony on the way home as we're walking on the sidewalk, I'm like, what do we  expect?  This thing had to end ugly.  It had to end ugly. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, and I started laughing because quickly I ran it through my head and, yeah, there was  no other way this bit could have ended but with a huge problem.  No, because we got excited, you know.  We get caught up in the moments and, you know, you see them happening.  Why don't you just scream at some of these people for not stopping you?  Huh?  Why don't you just scream at some of these people for not, don't you know to stop this?  We are children, you idiot.  We are children.  We don't know any better.  Why don't you just do be the responsible one? 
[01:25:30]  Take no responsibility for what you do.  You run it by them and then you, as they accept it, you go, okay.  That's why kids have babysitters.  Okay.  Have you ever just let your kids run wild in your house without a babysitter?  Leave your kid alone?  Yeah.  You know what it is?  I blame them for not having a babysitter.  When you go, hey, hey fellas, oh, you know what?  It's all on the media.  I like it.  Go on, go ahead, take it, run with it.  And you go, you leave, before you leave, you tape yourself, you tape the conversation and  you go, are you sure? 
[01:26:00]  And you go, yeah, yeah, go ahead.  Okay.  I don't know what's going to happen.  All right.  Well, here's how many guys out there, this kind of will give you an indication on how we  feel about certain bits and why we keep doing them when we know it might be getting out of  control.  How many guys, and I want you to be honest, have ever had sex with a girl, you had no  clue who they were, what they have, you wanted to use a condom, wasn't one around, and you 
[01:26:30]  just figured, what the fuck, I'm going to do it.  Patrice.  And knowing, Patrice, everyone's raising their fucking hand, is at some point in your  life, you've done this, knowing it is not in your best interest to do this, but are you  going to pass up such a good time and feeling so good?  I was walking in the office, I was pacing back and forth in the office like I was waiting  for the doctor to call to say, yeah, the tests are back and you're fine. 
[01:27:00]  That's exactly the point of what I'm saying about leaving office, now, let's say that  you go to do this raw activity that you ain't supposed to do, and you ask the girl, you  say, listen, can I sleep with you without a condom?  And she goes, okay, what are you going to do?  If she goes, all right, all right, she's wanting, all right, you can if you want.  That's the whole point.  Now, let me ask you a question.  One of these three particular stunts, including this one. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  We had a couple of those.  Not stunts, I'm saying, but they end up stunts after they get ready to fire you.  They call them stunts.  After they call them, right?  In the beginning there, they're great ideas.  Yeah, great ideas.  Stunts.  Have you ever been married, like, just artistically married to any three of these things?  Like, where you go, this is fantastic.  I love, like, you really, truly loved it enough to suffer through it.  Not so much the first one.  No, here's the, yeah, yeah. 
[01:28:00]  When we told all of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash, raping for us.  It was pretty spontaneous.  We just, we just wanted out of Boston.  We'll admit that now.  We were being treated like shit.  We weren't being paid well.  And back then, in radio, it was a known fact that if you do this edgy radio and you get  fired and you had some talent behind the edginess, you were going to get a better job and you  were going to get more money.  And a better market.  It was a fact.  A lot of jocks did it.  A lot of jocks did it.  You know, you name them, they did it. 
[01:28:30]  Okay.  So we knew we were on the cusp of something much bigger than what we were doing in Boston,  so we were taking chances.  We didn't care anymore.  And they didn't show any respect for us or what we do up there, so we said, fuck it.  You know?  That is the truth.  And we're great at it.  But knowing on April Fool's that you say, hey, that you go, the mayor died in a car crash  and you can go, April Fool's, that wasn't protection against the firing.  It's not.  We can rationalize.  We're great at rationalizing things. 
[01:29:00]  All of these things we've done, we've rationalized them in our heads.  But April Fool's was no protection for that.  We figured, it's April Fool's, we're putting out this news that the mayor was dead.  Okay.  Who the fuck is going to believe the Opie and Anthony show?  But there was no escape out of that to go, April Fool's, April Fool's, we were joking.  Well, this is where we're so fucking twisted and stupid and have absolutely no filter,  and that's why this show works on some level. 
[01:29:30]  We knew the show was ending soon, and we decided never to say April Fool's.  We just said...  Yeah, we never did say April Fool's.  We just said it has to be understood because it's April Fool's.  Eric, you shouldn't have handed this out because we're going to lead to that.  Okay.  Because now you've distracted everybody.  Until we don't have jobs anymore, you're going to have to listen to the opster.  Just ignore that he handed that to you because that's where this is leading.  Ignore that.  Anyway, so we did it, and next thing you know, our phone rang immediately. 
[01:30:00]  New York was calling.  Two stations in New York wanted us to broadcast immediately.  So it worked.  It worked in the end.  But then Ant and I learned.  We learned because then we were a little happier at N.E.W.  Yeah.  And we didn't want to get fired.  Of course not.  Why would you want to get fired from something you really, really like doing?  Like, if you love having sex, why would you ever, ever put yourself in the position  where you could never have sex again?  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense unless it's really bad sex, I guess. 
[01:30:30]  And then the N.E.W. thing was one of these things where it just, you know,  it just blew out of control on us.  And then we can rationalize it.  We had done it for years before.  It was sponsored.  Management had complete knowledge of it.  And we hadn't gotten in trouble for it before.  Would you have fought?  Like, what I'm saying is that bit, right?  Yeah.  Would you have fought? 
[01:31:00]  Like, if they said, listen, I see bad things coming for this bit.  Did you believe in it so much that you might have said, look, man, this is so good  that we're going to just, we'll take consequences for it.  Yeah, they've done that with a couple of bits back at N.E.W.  They told us, look, you can't do this anymore.  And we just go, well, you mother, you're taking away our bits.  So would you have screamed on, if they had said, nah, this assault on the media, eh,  looks like it, it has the potential to have something bad go on. 
[01:31:30]  If they had said, don't do it, right at the top, would you have been a little upset?  Just out of pure defiance?  Or would you have been able to see the consequences?  No, we'd have been pissed.  We would have been really pissed.  We would have been pissed.  But as it went on, if somebody, I guess, saw an escalation, but the escalation kind  of kicked up pretty quickly, didn't it?  Yeah.  The escalation happened all within the last couple of weeks.  Yeah.  Truly.  Before that, the whole concept had no problem.  Yeah, I don't think...  Well, because you can't, it was a movement then. 
[01:32:00]  That's a whole nother, that's just like if you offend, you know, a racial thing, you know  what I mean, if you offend the entire black community, the entire Latino community, right?  Yeah.  But like this one, like it's, again, I don't have the thousand yard stare yet.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Just got off the cherry.  You did.  You know?  Just got off the boat.  Cleaning up the shit stoves.  Yeah.  Somebody pouring the diesel fuel in the shit house.  Smoking on the long gun handle of William DePose. 
[01:32:30]  So, I ain't, you, this here, this here is Chris.  He ain't Taylor no more.  This here is Chris.  So, being that I'm new though, so that this particular stunt that, it's not a movement.  This is from a new, new eyes.  Uh-huh.  That this is not a movement that you offended.  This is a, you know, one guy's kind of rambunctiousness and he fucks with a guy's ears, but it's still  like, okay, let's say, like, remember, like I brought up earlier when Dr. D. David Schultz 
[01:33:00]  smacked, uh, John Stossel in the face, which is just classic genius to me back in the day.  David, Dr. D. got fired, but the whole company wasn't attacked because it was like one guy's  thing that he did to another guy.  Right.  So, I'm like, in my new eyes, I can't even see how could it escalate to the level of saying  that the mayor's dead or saying, or the whole, the whole church thing. 
[01:33:30]  Or the couple having sex at the same path.  Having sex at the same path.  It's just, it's just such a non-movement.  But here's, who does a movement?  There's no movement to have you guys removed.  But the whole mayor's prank in Boston, I listened to that show a little, I don't know, a bunch  of months ago.  That thing sounded so ridiculous, it's not even funny.  I was listening in going, who would believe this?  Yeah, it was so out there.  And when they fired over the top and they still fired us.  And here's the problem.  Did they tell you to get the fuck out of here?  No, no.  This is, all right, listen, let me take over a little bit here. 
[01:34:00]  Okay.  This is what I want to explain, because Eric Logan's like, guys, you know, don't worry,  just get back in there, do your show, and, you know, and just believe in me.  He believes in the show, right?  And we got off the phone, and I'm like, hey, man, I mean, I want to believe, excuse  me, I want to believe in the guy, but we'll see what XM's all about, to be honest with you,  because, you know, we've heard these things in the past.  You know, when we did the mayor's prank, there was like an internal investigation, and we're  in a hotel, in a conference room, and this lady, what the hell was her name, that twat? 
[01:34:30]  No clue.  That twat that lied right to our eyes.  We're sitting there, and they separated us, which is never a good sign, because they  want to know what...  L.A. Confidential.  Oh, yeah.  Man.  They want to know what I knew, and what Anthony knew, who came up with the idea.  You know, I hope he just told me that you said...  Yeah, exactly.  He's trying to get us to roll over on each other.  And I'm like, Anthony, step...  Well, let me tell you something about Anthony. 
[01:35:00]  No.  That nigga fucks...  He fucks chicken.  Let me tell you something.  I can find ten Anthony's.  You just go with me.  Trying to get us to roll.  Fuck that air-conditioning, motherfucker.  That's right.  Motherfucker.  That air-conditioning salesman?  I am Anthony.  There's a million funny air-conditioning guys out there.  I'm taking applications from refrigerator repairmen now.  Empty these AC niggas.  Dude, the one thing I can tell you about our relationship, Anthony and I, we never even have 
[01:35:30]  to ask each other.  Never.  Nope.  They've been playing this good cop, bad cop with us ever since we started our careers.  I don't even have to ask Anthony ever if, you know, he's going behind my back with some  shit.  It's so funny.  Ever.  It's just...  It's just known that that will never happen.  That's a fact.  Never asked him.  We actually laugh at the people that give it an attempt, because no matter how sly they  think they're being, we see it coming so, so early. 
[01:36:00]  It's like, ah, here they go.  They're going to try it.  Do you look through the double glass window at the person listening like...  Look through.  They think it's just a big mirror on the wall.  I know somebody's back there.  Light up a cigarette.  Take a puff.  Look at the mirror.  And even though you can't see anyone, you're looking right into their eyes.  Right into their eyes.  Okay, fist.  I know exactly where to look.  So, I can't see shit, but I'm looking right into your eyes.  That's right.  Ooh.  That's right.  So, but how this all kind of relates, you know, we're feeling a little better about the 
[01:36:30]  whole thing right now.  We're not going to try to, you know, lie and fake shit here.  But we're still a little nervous, because we've heard this.  So, we're in the hotel after the mayor's prank.  They separate us.  And she has a pad out, and she's interviewing everybody involved with the dumb bit.  And I'll never forget, I think she said it to both of us, too.  Both of us.  All right, let's get this over with, so we can get you guys back on the air.  And the way...  And that's all the questions.  That sounds really comforting.  That sounds really...  It was. 
[01:37:00]  That's what pissed me off.  She looked and said, all right, we'll get this investigation done.  And then she was like an older woman, middle-aged, kind of middle-aged to older, that you can  tell might have been attractive in her youth.  And then she looked at us, said, we'll get this questions and this investigation over.  And then she curled...  I can see her fucking face still.  She curled her nose up in, like, a cute little fashion and went, get you guys back on the air.  She kind of had that Hillary Clinton look to her. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, so I'm looking, and you know what?  It gave me hope.  That's her.  Because it's a down-to-earth kind of...  Right.  It was a kind of down-to-earth kind of, well, I know it's bullshit.  And in her head...  It's my job.  In her head was, I already know these fucks are fired.  Right.  I just want to get as much info so I can know who else to fire.  Exactly.  Like the program director and the general manager.  She was like...  She was a general manager.  She was one of the corporate people that flew in for this. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, so she was running a bunch of stations.  Get these guys back on the air.  And I worked with her in Rochester.  She's like, oh, Opie, nice to see you again.  So I was like, okay.  And I'll never forget that feeling of fake hope that I had.  And I felt like an asshole later when we did get fired.  I was like, that bitch made me hope and think that everything was okay.  And after that, never again.  And Patrice, I'll tell you.  That's why we'll still hear this shit.  I'll tell you right now, I pray that I bump into her someday. 
[01:38:30]  So you're going to trash her?  And I'll spit right in her face, no problem.  Delicious.  No fucking problem.  Delicious.  Did you get the same fake hope for the church thing?  No.  Because of her, I kind of learned, and I really knew we were done.  No, not from your learning experience, but if you didn't have Boston happen to you, was  there fake hope in that situation?  Yeah, there was.  They always try to put the fake hope.  They know if they walk up to you and just say, you guys are fucked. 
[01:39:00]  Now you're going to sit down, and you're going to spill the beans and tell us everything  that happened.  Then you're going to turn around and go, you know something?  You go fuck yourself.  I'm not saying shit.  So what they do is, they never tell you you're going to be fired.  They know you're going to be fired, but they want to get info out of you, so they tell  you that there's an internal investigation.  We just want to find out who is responsible for certain things.  We're going to suspend the show, and you're thinking, all right, well, they would fire  us if they were going to fire us, so it's just a suspension.  We'll talk to these people, and it's in our head, rationalized so well, that we're going 
[01:39:30]  to talk, and it's going to be like fucking Perry Mason.  You know, they're all going to go, well, look what Anthony just said.  Get back to work, guys.  That made perfect sense, but it doesn't work like that.  You go in, you're questioned, you answer the questions, and eventually.  Well, with the WNAW Sex for Sam thing, we get called in for a meeting.  I guess it was the next day.  I don't know exactly.  And it was John Sykes.  Another guy I will have no problem spitting in the face of. 
[01:40:00]  Imagine if they're walking arm and arm down the street.  Absolutely no problem.  And I'll tell you why.  Because he sits us down, right?  And he's like, oh my God, you guys are, you know, he goes, you guys are so freaking  talented, blah, blah, blah.  The company loves you.  He goes, you guys just don't have to do this type of thing.  You know, you don't have to do these stunts.  Yeah.  And we were starting to understand that we didn't really need to do that.  The whole stunt thing with this show served its purpose, and I don't regret any of them  because it got our name out there and got people talking, you know? 
[01:40:30]  Right.  And that's the way you get people to listen, and then hopefully they hear the funny, and  then there you go.  You build the audience, you know, in simple terms.  So he's like, you guys don't have to do this.  You're so talented.  And he's basically giving us hope going, you know, we'll get through this and blah, blah,  blah.  The same.  We'll get through this crap.  His phone.  There you go.  Oh, John Sykes, his phone is ringing in the middle of our meeting here that we're having.  Right.  Where he's giving us hope.  We're like, oh.  He's giving us hope.  All of a sudden you're breathing for the first time in 24 hours. 
[01:41:00]  Like, oh, I got some hope.  I think we're going to skate.  And let me tell you who this guy was.  He was the head muckety-muck over there at Infinity when Fareed, who was the head muckety-muck,  who loved us, left.  These are the guys that were right under Mel.  Mel Karmeson at the time.  Fareed loved us.  He left.  This guy, John, comes in.  Not such a fan of ours.  But he's telling us everything's going to be cool.  Same stuff we've heard before.  Don't worry about it.  We'll get through this. 
[01:41:30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  His phone rings.  He just was going, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Click.  Um, I gotta go.  Uh, we'll talk soon.  All right.  But, um, John, we were going to want to, yeah, I gotta go.  I gotta, like, all of a sudden, we had leprosy. 
[01:42:00]  He walked out that door so quickly, and we later found out what that phone call was.  It was.  Our firing was going down right there.  It was done right there.  It was already being discussed.  They called him.  Done and said no.  To tell him, this is what we're going to do in this situation.  And he's talking to us.  Wash their fingerprints off you.  Yeah.  You could see it in his eyes.  And don't say another word to them, because whatever you say, they might be able to turn  around and say you said it.  Because at this point, they were still talking multi-million dollar lawsuits and stuff.  Yeah.  And it was a Donnie Brasco thing, too, because it's like, who's on your side? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Right.  Because we're getting rid of them, too.  So everybody has to make sure that I didn't, I didn't, uh, what's Al Pacino's character in  that movie?  It's like, you gotta, you.  Everyone just covers their ass.  You gotta go.  But now, is Eric Logan, is he the.  Is his word law, or there's people above Eric Logan?  There's people above him, you know?  There's people above him.  There's people above everybody in corporate America.  Yeah.  He believes in the show.  He believes that this show is going places.  I honestly believe in Eric Logan and believe that he enjoys the show. 
[01:43:00]  He sees the great potential that the show has for XM.  You don't feel false hope in Eric.  You know, this is not a fault.  This is not a A.  But it has no idea.  You know something?  He's been our biggest cheerleader at XM, so.  If John Sykes was a fan of the show, and sincerely meant, you guys will be alright, don't worry,  and then that phone call comes in, you know, things change.  So that's what, that's the point we're at.  We're never confident, no matter who tells us what, because that phone call comes in. 
[01:43:30]  Whether it's, you know, the next guy up, or the next two guys up, or the friggin' cigarette-smoking guy from the X-Files calling, you know?  It's just, that's it.  Game's over.  But is this company's direction the same way, like, say, HBO gets to be how it is, because it can be not like ABC, not like CBS.  It can be, it can be touchy, and it can be edgy, and it can be fucking crazy, right?  Yeah.  Is it, is XM, is it their direction to go, we want to be as different from that confined thing on regular radio? 
[01:44:00]  They want to be a bunch of different things.  You know, they want some of this edgy radio, but they also want sports.  They also want some political talk.  Which is great.  It gives you diversity.  Yeah, they want a lot of diversity.  But as far as how they handle situations like this, how would regular radio handle a similar situation, and how does XM and the differences between the two, I don't know.  You think NEW fires you behind this thing? 
[01:44:30]  For this?  I don't know.  No.  No.  And there's no commercials on these things, right?  It's like, usually a sponsorship that says, oh, that dictates someone's firing.  Well, the talk stations, or our channel, we have commercials.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, we have commercials.  And I guess they're doing pretty well with that.  And we have sponsors, and there are corporate partnerships that XM has with certain corporations.  Oh, right, okay, yeah.  So, you know, that's the brave new world we kind of live in, you know? 
[01:45:00]  Right.  It's where it used to be treading a fine line to watch the language you use on the air.  Now it's treading a fine line that you don't want to screw up relationships.  Right.  You know?  That's kind of the new place we're at.  Well, we'll see what kind of support we got, you know?  Yeah.  We'll see.  Anyway, what Eric was handing out in the middle of that.  Oh, let me read it now.  Well, the story made the New Jersey Star Ledger.  Which really, you know, is nothing. 
[01:45:30]  Is whatever.  But now, unfortunately, unfortunately for us, I don't think this is going to work in our favor.  Or, 10-10 wins.  10-10 wins.  All news.  All the time.  Meaning, they're reading this copy on air every 15 minutes.  And they'll do it all day long.  I'm John Montone.  You read this one, Anthony.  Ocean Township Police have questioned a man suspected of blasting an air horn into the ear of a TV reporter during a live report. 
[01:46:00]  A man carrying a bumper sticker for the opening Anthony program on XM Satellite lunged at WABC TV's Anthony Johnson during a report on Tuesday's snowstorm.  The station cut away so viewers never heard the horn go off in Johnson's ear.  Police spoke to the man but have not released his name because he has not been charged.  The New York TV station is deciding whether to pursue charges.  Opie and Anthony have an ongoing contest. 
[01:46:30]  Had now.  It's not ongoing anymore.  It's over, Johnny.  Called Assault on the Media, which listeners are encouraged to disrupt live reports by waving Opie and Anthony signs.  The contest rules tell listeners not to touch reporters or pick fights.  I do appreciate the news agencies so far, the two that have reported on this, and I hope any others that continue do the same.  I do appreciate that they said what the contest rules were.  That you don't injure or touch or in any way assault the reporters. 
[01:47:00]  That isn't what this was about.  It's never what it was about.  It was about just getting the Opie and Anthony name in the camera shot.  And, you know, it turned into that, and I do appreciate that the news is actually printing that.  XM issued a statement calling the incident an irresponsible act of an individual.  Acting Governor Cody says the person should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
[01:47:30]  There you go.  So where's that guy with the fake suspension shit now that it's hit 10-7 wins?  I don't know.  I might read his follow-up instant feedback, but, oh, that's right, he can't get through.  And I've just been handing a note, WCBS 880 News is also running a piece on air.  So there you go.  Keep thinking it's a cute radio bit.  That's all cute stuff.  Cute bit that kept me up all night last night that I'm frigging exhausted today. 
[01:48:00]  Keep thinking that, you know, we're just playing into this.  That's what it is.  You must be a real, a true fan of this show and know what it's all about to know that.  That's what we do all the time.  We just do these fake, like, radio bits.  Jackass.  Anyway.  Thank God Patrice is here today.  That's all I've got to say.  Thank God.  I have two words to say.  Yes?  Tissue time.  You know, why don't we just get right back into diving here first. 
[01:48:30]  Tissue time.  Get back on the horse.  Get on the bicycle.  Whatever analogy you want to use to get this show back on track, we get you guys back on track.  That's right.  Tissue time.  Yeah.  It'll make us all happy again, right?  I think I saw pictures of Michelle on, was it Michelle?  I believe it was, on Wack Bag.  Is she hot? 
[01:49:00]  Which, by the way, has completely crashed.  Most of our fan sites are completely crashed right now.  The fans loved her.  She's naked.  You can see her from the waist up.  She's laying on a bed with her beautiful breasts just, like, squished kind of together.  And she's smiling into the camera.  Cute girl.  So, not one of those things where, you know, you're listening to her and then you find out what she looks like and it kind of ruins the bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, the people on Wack Bag really seem to enjoy her. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, is that her?  Yeah.  Look at that.  That's the girl that's been doing Tissue Time?  Yeah.  Well, all right.  You asked for it, you got it.  She has the best.  There's a topless picture of Michelle from Tissue Time on Wack Bag.  She has some nice soggies, man.  TF, man.  That is just TF titties she's got.  All right, very good.  She's been the one that's been doing the Tissue Time.  We're going to do Tissue Time today.  Jerry's got a great question.  And, Ben, you've got to help us out.  Jerry?  Jerry? 
[01:50:00]  Ben's been on the phone all morning.  That, though.  I'm looking into the office.  Ben, come on in here.  Jerry in Chicago, what's up?  Hey, have you guys...  Oh, look.  There's our buddy on TV and his family.  What?  That's Cody.  That's the governor.  That's Cody right there?  Yeah, and his wife and kids.  Oh, so, yeah.  He is a...  That guy's gone, so...  Jerry in Chicago.  Hey, have you guys called Jimmy yet?  He's got to be freaking...  Oh, my God.  That's why I wanted Ben in here.  We all got the Jimmy call last night.  It amazes me how Jimmy jumps into action when this shit goes down, man. 
[01:50:30]  He called all of us and was giving us speeches like he was our father.  Oh, boy.  And I'm like, Jimmy, you sit where Patrice sits.  You were part of probably 50 assaults on the media.  Now you're going to tell us that it's wrong.  Now you're going to tell us?  Anthony, Anthony, it's Jim.  We can't be doing these things when listeners are responsible for taking over the show anymore. 
[01:51:00]  It's not working.  We get in trouble every time for this.  I can't go through this anymore.  Is this Jimmy Norton?  Wait, he was that calm when he talked to you?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I think he had already been riled up enough between your guys' death.  This is all I said to him was, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, I know.  You're right.  Uh-huh.  Yes, you're right. 
[01:51:30]  Then I'm thinking, some of the shit that comes out of his mouth, some of the shit that goes into his mouth.  That's people.  How long speech can he give?  Honey, get out.  I said stop shitting on me.  This is serious business here.  Anthony, Opie, how can you do this?  All of a sudden.  Sweetie, could you stop peeing on my toes for five minutes?  All of a sudden, he's the voice of reason?  I'm fucking looking at my cell phone like you're the voice of reason?  Some of the shit he says in this program could get us in some serious trouble. 
[01:52:00]  I've been gone two days, and you guys fucked up.  It's what the fuck.  I'm in L.A.  I can't control this.  You guys fucked up.  I'm pissed off.  We're going to get fired.  Here it is through the Jimmy translator.  I just bought a very expensive place.  The HBO thing is going good, but it's not paying all the bills.  What are you guys crazy?  I need a steady fucking paycheck.  Why would a person who gets dumped on by trannies buy a $7 billion? 
[01:52:30]  You should have a room waiting like me.  I know my career can take a plunge at any moment.  And you're not going to be in poverty.  See, you're with us.  See, people are very surprised at this fact, but Anthony and I still don't own.  We rent.  We still rent.  I rent.  Because we don't even believe.  Because at any moment, you two...  We need a professional babysitter.  I'm saying it right now.  Put it this way.  We have no filter.  Do not blame yourselves.  Well, we do have a filter, but it's as big as a fishing net right now. 
[01:53:00]  We need to make it more into a colander.  Sir, everything I own can be put in one of those garage storage things that you rent.  Everything I own.  No, it's smart.  I don't own that much.  I'm even better than you.  Why?  I can fit everything I own, no joke, in my truck.  In my SUV.  Your couch?  Your big screen TV?  I've done it over the years.  You know, when this shit happens, you've got to move or whatever.  Oh, I know, moving.  You just pile it out front, and you get new stuff eventually. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, so you're not even taking anything?  It's not that nice.  I could put everything in a storage container.  It's not worth the hassle of getting the U-Haul and trying to find one stupid friend that's  going to help you move.  And live in my car at the repo man chases me.  I drag it out onto the street.  Yeah.  You know, there's some things I want.  My clothes, obviously.  You know, dumb shit.  And that's it.  And then you move on.  You guys should...  This is what you should do.  I want to own a house.  This is the new plan.  New plan.  And I'm just covering for a guy who covers for another guy. 
[01:54:00]  And I want y'all to stay.  You always run it by the people, right?  Yeah.  And when it goes down, you're able to blame them for letting you do it.  You always put yourself...  And this is the thing.  You announce the plan.  This is what you do on the station.  On the air.  Announce the plan.  Like, the next crazy thing.  Like, the next assault on whatever.  You announce it to the fans.  And go, hey, we got this great plan.  We got this great idea.  We're going to run it by the people. 
[01:54:30]  We're going to run it by management.  You let everybody know the process of something like the assault on the media.  You let them know the process.  You go, we got this plan for assault on the media.  It ain't going on yet because we didn't ask permission.  We're going to ask permission.  Come back and they say, they gave us permission, everybody.  See, here's what happens, though.  Here's what happens when you're an entertainer on the radio.  You come up with an idea.  You know if you run it past management, they're going to say no.  No.  They always say no.  You know if you do it.  This is our life. 
[01:55:00]  You know if you do it and they kind of have an idea that you're doing it, it'll get sponsorship.  You'll be able to do it for a while.  If it really takes off and becomes popular, they'll, like, pat you on the back a little bit.  And, you know, things are going well.  But if you ask, they say no.  Well, come back and tell them they say no.  And here's why.  They know your plan before we know your plan.  They know that if we come to them with a plan, they say no.  Because if they said yes, they're responsible. 
[01:55:30]  And they're not that stupid.  Right.  You can tell the listeners, they said no again.  Yeah.  They thought that was going to be a good plan, but they just keep saying no.  And there's a reason management manages.  They weren't good at doing this.  That's true.  Everybody wanted to be on the radio.  We all started in college radio, and some had it, and others went behind the scenes.  The trick to radio success.  Some of them were very, very successful behind the scenes.  Is balls.  Is having a set of balls big enough to take the chance that you're going to get your ass 
[01:56:00]  thrown out of your job, and hopefully you parlay it into a better job.  I never have comfort.  I just don't understand what comfort is.  That's why I buy things.  I'm surprised I pay for my truck.  I'm very surprised that I didn't buy another used car, just so I know I have something  in case it all comes crashing down.  And Repo Man comes and takes your vehicle that you owe money on.  Dumb, comfortable.  How can a guy who gets raped and peed on on a regular basis feel comfortable that his career 
[01:56:30]  is going to continue to have an upswing?  That corporate America can allow a guy to get dumped on his little goofy chest.  Shouldn't he expect that his life should just crumble because the job will go away?  Right.  He's like, I have a sexual deviance problem, which people don't really like that much.  No.  You know what?  Let me just buy something in my means.  A small ranch home in Connecticut for a couple of thousand or whatever.  And that'll be my thing.  But not elaborate mansions at the Trump. 
[01:57:00]  He's crazy.  You know, whatever.  Yeah.  He's crazy.  All right, let's go to the phone and say hi to Steve in North Carolina.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, I don't want to scare Anthony, but I think I see Elo out in the parking lot unscrewing  a door on a car.  Is he taking my door?  Bastard.  Just got that for me.  Very good.  Elo's unscrewing my door.  Let's go to Kyle in Virginia.  Kyle.  Hey, you guys going to get a mi-fi from Elo for winning the Assault on the Media in 
[01:57:30]  December?  You got CBS and 10-10 wins?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to say it again in case you're just tuning in.  The Assault on the Media contest is completely over and done with.  Over and out.  That's right.  You're the final winners.  All right.  You won.  We're working on this kidnapping bid.  It's going to be great.  We don't have all the details yet, but...  We've got to run it by.  We're not running it by shit, man.  We got a new kidnapping bid. 
[01:58:00]  We got a kidnapping bid that's going to set the radio world on fire.  We've learned our lesson.  We don't need to do the Assault on the Media thing anymore, but...  Oh, God.  We're going to wait until you hear what we got planned next.  How...  You know, if we want exposure, what better exposure than an Opie and Anthony Amber Alert,  where the child is known to be with us, so they have to say our name all over the country  on the Amber Alert system.  And the guy makes the kidnap kid hold up an Opie and Anthony wow sticker. 
[01:58:30]  Is this the world we're living in now?  He's on surveillance.  He has the wow sticker pulling the kid.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh.  Anyway.  Just...  See, that's what they're expecting, though.  That's what the listeners expect, and that's what the idiots that go by the name of Opie  and Anthony sometimes put out there.  This is what I'm thinking.  If we get through this...  Yeah.  And I'm feeling like we're going to. 
[01:59:00]  Knock wood.  I believe in XM.  I believe in ELO.  I think they're going to hire one of those crazy nannies from that TV show to be here every  day.  What are you boys doing?  They're acting horrible.  Their behavior is deplorable.  Oh, from the nanny show.  Yeah.  Where they have to come and dress like the British nanny.  Right.  And reprimand us, and then by the end of the show, are we all polite and nice?  Oh, yeah.  And doing, like, battle of the sexes bits?  No, next thing you know, we're doing boring radio. 
[01:59:30]  Or the door's going to open up, and some big announcer's going to go, meet your new mommy.  And they get, like, they trade bosses, so ELO's got to go over to, like, PLJ, and their  boss has to come over here and deal with us.  Yeah.  And give us, like, a minute-by-minute script of what we're supposed to read and do on the  air.  Trading bosses.  Trading bosses.  That's what's going to happen.  That's going to happen. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  God damn.  Let's say hi.  Always in it.  Always bad.  I'm getting too old for this shit.  Anthony and I actually looked at each other this morning and said, you know what?  There was a time we loved this energy and this living on the edge shit.  And we looked at each other like, we're just getting too old for this crap, man.  And don't take that as we've given up on putting out entertaining, fun radio.  That, I live to come in here and goof off and have fun every day.  Believe me. 
[02:00:30]  I love doing voices, goofing with my friends.  That's what it's all about.  But as far as going in a boss's office, taking those phone calls, staying up all night because  the thought of being fired is in your head, that shit to me is so old and so done.  Me and Opie used to call.  We would be on the phone with each other for hours on end, just going online, looking at  the stories.  Oh, dude, how do you think?  Are we fucked?  Are we this?  Last night, Opie called. 
[02:01:00]  Dude, hear anything?  I'm like, I checked the websites.  I, all right, hold on.  I'll call.  I'm raising 500.  I'm taking the call as I'm playing poker because I just can't, I can't dedicate my entire emotional  status at that moment to the crisis.  I listened as Anthony went all in and lost to his girlfriend.  I had a pair of tens.  She had a pair of queens.  She had a jack queen.  Yeah, I was short stack.  I went all in. 
[02:01:30]  She covered me.  A fucking queen came up on the turn.  Game over, Johnny, for Mick.  Yeah.  See, you're not saying that.  Anthony's learning how to play poker through, uh...  Bodog.  Bodog.net.  Bodog.net.  That's right.  Bodog.net.  It was a great play that I did.  It was a great play I made.  I was short stacked.  I went all in on a pair of tens.  That's right.  And I had it up until the turn when the queen, uh, turned over.  Uh, you want to learn how to play poker?  You go to Bodog.net.  Uh-huh.  Learn how to bluff, how to bet, tips on hand selection, when to bet. 
[02:02:00]  It's all free.  It's fast.  You're going to get all the tools you need to make you a stronger poker player.  That's right.  Uh, you just go to Bodog.net.  And, uh, they're going to teach you everything you need to know.  Instead of physically being whipped, it's like, it's good to see white people, this is the side of watching white people, like, become slaves.  Like, if your names were cool, when you came in, let me tell you about the Bodog.  Let me tell you about Bodog.net, too. 
[02:02:30]  When you take your, uh, 20-year career and go all in.  Yeah.  That's exactly it.  20 years of radio.  And you got a two and a five in the hole.  I'm all feeling comfortable.  I'm all feeling comfortable.  Like, hey, you know what?  I ride with a couple of white guys.  No one bothers them.  But I'm, like, in the background going, I physically get a whipping.  What's your name?  Kunta.  What's your name?  All right, Toby.  Fuck it, it hurts.  But to watch the mental grinding that you do. 
[02:03:00]  Well, when you's in the house with Massa, and he lets you near the computer, log on to Bodog.net.  You're going to learn how to play your poker.  Oh, you two coons.  You just beat to death.  Lord it, gee.  I'm just playing poker, sir.  XM stands for extra, extra mo, please.  Right.  By the way.  You two fucking goddamn coons. 
[02:03:30]  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  By the way, when your company is about to fuck you over, why not have it done on the liberator?  Yes.  Any position necessary can be done on the liberator.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  But even though you can get to any position on the liberator, you're going to want to get into the one where you can take it in the ass.  Oh, man.  I love that thing.  20-year career all in. 
[02:04:00]  I'm all in.  Let's look at our cards.  Got a two and a five, and there's an ace and king up there.  Oh, this is bad.  I think it's looking good.  What happened?  It's looking good for me.  Good for me now.  Holy crap.  Anyway, where are we?  Goddamn.  Goddamn.  Really.  Really.  Jesus.  Let's listen.  We're going to log on to Bodog. 
[02:04:30]  Bodog.net.  I'm going to learn to play the poker on the Bodog.net.  Say it, everyone.  At the computer.  Well, a master let me play in.  I play's on the poker.  I said all in, nigga.  I'm sorry, sir.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And when you're looking for a final meal before you get fired, how about Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Illinois? 
[02:05:00]  When you've got to take the edge off of firing, just mention Opie and Anthony, and you'll get that free glass of wine to make your firing a little easier.  Nothing against Joey, but fuck the free glass of wine.  I love Jägermeister.  Jäger.  Speaking of Jägermeister, they're having a fine music tour right now with Disturbed and Corrosion and Conformity.  Great prizes that they're giving away.  Guitars, guitar cases, Jägermeister.  Kumputa.  My Kumputa. 
[02:05:30]  My Kumputa.  Let's go to Kenny in New Jersey.  Kenny, what's up?  Hi, I want to know if you guys can confirm this EP story I just read.  It says here, Eric Logan of XM has made a deal and smoothed things over, you know, for involved with Assault on Immediate.  Oh, wow.  You had a great line, but your cell phone started crapping out.  Throw pies at O&A.  Yeah, the throw pies at O&A thing.  Dude, it lost the thunder because your cell phone crapped out right when you needed to be strong with that. 
[02:06:00]  You know, if you have, I don't know, a couple of hours to spend a day,  or if you have two years where you don't have to go to work, Opie, you should sign up for GameFly.com.  All the games, video games that you're going to need to play available at GameFly.com.  That's right.  That's what I'm going to do.  That's right.  Let's go to Todd in New York City.  Todd?  Hey, I got a question for Patrice.  I want to know if on Monday morning at 7 a.m. is it going to be the Little Jimmy and Patrice show or Patrice and Little Jimmy show? 
[02:06:30]  I wouldn't.  Please.  That Little Worm Jimmy, we have bits like, hey, everybody, it's tickle guy dressed as Santa Claus Day.  You'll dump us off the radio so fast.  Let me tell you something.  I was in this room.  I love being here because it's easy for me.  But the technical part of this shit, when Opie left, right, he goes, I got to go for a second.  And if you had to go, I got to go.  Hey, Patrice, do me a favor.  Hand up the show. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, just talk.  I'm like this.  It's like that SNL bit where they just fall apart in front of everyone's eyes because the director and the producer left the set.  I don't.  I follow the lead.  I watch Opie go there.  Hey, we're going to talk about bears today or, you know, we're going to talk about dinner.  I'm like, I can talk about that.  If I'm in the part of myself going, all right, what do we got here, a bunch of CDs in my face?  What the fuck are we talking about?  I have no idea. 
[02:07:30]  Hey, Tyra Banks said something.  Let's see what she said.  All right, she said that.  All righty, good.  Yep.  Good goody.  Let's call, we're taking a call from a guy in Jersey.  Patrice, you suck, motherfucker.  Thank you, guy in Jersey.  That's how it works when they hire guys to do radio that really have never done radio.  That's why David Lee Roth's going to be a complete disaster.  I have no illusions about what it is.  I sit here and I watch it.  It's like, what's the thing people say when they leave the radio after they hang up? 
[02:08:00]  Check it out?  You're punching out.  Punch it out.  I'll be like, all right, crossing on.  Let's go to Anthony in Philly.  Anthony.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Anthony.  You scared the shit out of me this morning.  I was almost throwing up my car when you guys were talking about this.  I was like, no, it can't be again.  It can't be again.  And I'm looking at the camera and saying, it's fucking Pearl Harbor Day.  The news is going to run with this one.  Well, that's what we're hanging in there, but the story has little legs.  Little legs. 
[02:08:30]  And also, I was envisioning the stern walking in the series thinking, now he's the king again.  Now he can rest easy.  We can't let him walk in the series and do that.  I guarantee they're smiling over there today.  And don't forget, stern's still a shit dick.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Check it out.  Let's say hi to Steve in Bayshore.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, boys.  This is certainly a not-in-the-stomach morning.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  It's a little weird in that way.  We get really pissed off, though, with that guy saying, oh, here comes the fake suspension.  We've never done a fake suspension in our careers. 
[02:09:00]  I'm not doubting it for a minute.  It's got me all freaked out.  We just have seen the pattern of how these things kind of develop, and so we're a little  nervous.  That's all.  Yeah, I hear you.  This assault on the media thing is sort of like an airplane built by the pests flown  just a little too far.  And you knew it was going to come crashing down at some point.  It's just, you know, who knew it was going to land on the governor of New Jersey's lawn?  We started realizing that the thing was getting out of control, and we were, you know, preparing  to figure out how to end the thing. 
[02:09:30]  Well, one was always trying to top the next, and when you get into that kind of competition,  it really gets dangerous because, you know, a couple of guys see an assault, and it gets  a little closer to the reporter, or they go in front of the camera, or they're really  yelling loud, and then the next guy wants to top that, and it always ends bad when you  play Can You Top This?  Oh, it most certainly does.  Anyway, Patrice, you know, you are one funny guy. 
[02:10:00]  You're my favorite, Mabobo.  Have a great day, boys.  Mabobo.  Loves you.  Yeah, we love the Patrice.  Patrice O'Neal, everybody.  Let's say hi to Alan in Atlanta.  Sorry.  Alan, what's up?  Morning, fellas.  Can I request a reset here?  I have no idea what the hell is going on, and...  Well, the Assault in the Media contest got out of hand.  It's officially over.  We're not endorsing that whatsoever anymore.  Well, you got the channel, man.  I would just suggest you listen to the replay. 
[02:10:30]  The show started off pretty ugly, actually.  In the morning.  Yeah.  And little Jimmy freaked out.  Yeah, we explain everything.  Basically, what you're going to hear on the replay today, right off the bat, we explain  the situation we're in, and then we take a very long break, like a 40-minute break,  we played a bit from yesterday, and then we came back.  So that's what I would suggest you do, really, or go to audible.com and get the show.  I appreciate that, fellas.  Because we are going to try to move on, but we're a little nervous today. 
[02:11:00]  The Assault in the Media thing got out of control.  One of the fans of the show used an air horn on a reporter, and the reporter's claiming  that he's got ear damage, and the governor of New Jersey got involved, and it made a Jersey  paper, and now it's on the all-news stations here in New York.  Well, you all have Elo in your corner.  That should be plenty.  He's telling us not to worry.  We're not going to throw false information out, but even with him saying that, we're  a little nervous, because we've heard that before in our past. 
[02:11:30]  That's all we're saying.  Well, we need you guys to stay put.  All right.  Thank you, Alan.  Talk to you now, boys.  All right.  That's pretty much it.  If you want to hear more about it, just listen to the replay today.  That's the beauty of having the show on all day.  Yeah.  Unless, unless, this is how sad this is.  You don't want to ever come to work, and the first thing you say as you get into your  office and take your coat off is, well, our security card still worked.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  The doors weren't locked. 
[02:12:00]  How long before you guys are going to feel like the pep in your step even, how long it's  going to take?  It all depends on what happens.  Yeah, when you get your arrogance back.  We got it backwards?  No, you know what I mean.  Like, when you're not, when you're just, when you're just, like, walking and you're like,  ah, all right.  Not even thinking about it.  Not even thinking about it.  Let me think.  It all depends on what happens, though.  The next couple of days, I guess.  And then by, by, I guess by Monday. 
[02:12:30]  You know, by Monday.  Yeah.  It'll be a little better.  Yeah.  It's a new week.  They take care of business.  So, by Friday, we're all right by Friday afternoon.  We should be all right.  So, they don't play two-week games with your life.  Fuck no.  We got two days.  Few day games.  We got two days of sweat.  Yeah.  If nothing happens in two days, then it's all right.  If some other meetings have to be set up and talkings to, then there could be a problem.  We're having a, and this is not a tease.  It's just what it is. 
[02:13:00]  We're having another phone call with Eric Logan right after the show.  So, which works in our favor, because then everyone's going to want to know what happened.  And hopefully, well.  What happened?  I'm sure we'll be on the air tomorrow to explain what happened, I guess.  So.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  I say tissue time.  Where's Steve?  Steve's got a number of a girl that desperately wants to play tissue time today.  You got to take a piss, Patrice?  I'll go take a piss.  That is destroyed.  Go take, go take, go.  But we're doing this thing here. 
[02:13:30]  Go piss, Pete.  This is like a professional show.  Like, you don't just, if you're on Leno, you don't just get up and.  Let the man take a piss.  You can't take a.  I mean, you can compare my stupidity to another radio show and not television.  I mean, I wouldn't get up on Leno.  We would.  I think I would get up on a fucking radio show where people don't know I got up until I.  Until somebody says, rat's you out.  Hey, fat ass, sit down.  Don't piss.  What's up, Steve?  Anthony, this just in.  All of my Opie and Anthony t-shirts are now 80% off. 
[02:14:00]  That's my brother, Elmo, in Huntington.  Check it in.  Discount.  My brother, the last time we got fired, I got to tell you, he got fucked so bad.  We finally decided to kind of merchandise the show a little bit, right?  He fucking made all these great designs for t-shirts.  And he doesn't make a lot of money, so he was counting on this, right?  He's got boxes and boxes piled up to the ceiling in his apartment.  Man, we're ready to go on the air and sell these things, right?  We get fired.  Those freaking shirts sat in those boxes for three years, basically. 
[02:14:30]  Three years.  Oh, man.  And it had NEW on it, didn't it?  Yeah.  And then when we got back on the radio, he still really couldn't sell them because they  were like, you know, they were different themes that we were doing at the time.  You could have made money, though, because you know how they have those hats where, like,  you go right after a team wins a championship, it's like, well, how'd you motherfuckers get  that hat for those flicks?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like they both had them champ just in case they won.  Yeah, just in case.  So it's like you could sell those as the, like, if you got Philadelphia Eagles, world 
[02:15:00]  Super Bowl champions, and he's like, oh, let's sell those and shit.  People buy those shit.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't know.  What happens to the loser hats?  You never see them.  People would buy them.  They would.  Because no one from the organization wants to see that.  So there's got to be a guy, his whole job is to load the truck with all the boxes.  There must be a contract thing where they have to be destroyed.  Immediately.  Because you really don't see many of them get out.  You would see them all over.  Yeah, you know they printed up a boatload, man.  So there's got to be a guy, his whole job is to get rid of them immediately, burn them, 
[02:15:30]  whatever.  That's great.  So you can sell them, man.  EW shirts, man.  Old school.  Just in time for the holiday, though, there's some Opie and Anthony t-shirts being sold on  opiananthony.com.  All right?  You order soon.  You're getting in time for Christmas.  Can you tell Poe to have that bathroom open as soon as we take this break?  Yeah.  You're ready to explode.  Oh, my left ball is getting ready to fall on my chest.  What is, uh, Teddy?  It's like, wah.  We did that on purpose.  We just wanted you to walk out uncomfortably.  Why has Steve come in? 
[02:16:00]  I don't know.  I got told to come in here.  I was in the other room making my tippy-tom bit, and I got told to come in here.  Don't you have a girl for tissue time today?  I do.  Our brand new brilliant bit?  I do.  I think her name's Susan.  Susan?  She's a...  Tissue time with Susan?  Exactly.  Tissue time with Susan.  Susan, okay.  Hello, Susan.  Michelle might get jealous, though.  Tissue time with Michelle's working out pretty well, and now she's got a topless shot on  a whack bag.  Well, Susan's a girl that apparently does it professionally, so she might be jealous.  Oh, that's a run for her money.  All right. 
[02:16:30]  Let's try to get everyone into a better mood.  When we get back, we'll do tissue time with Susan, hopefully.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate it. 
[02:17:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mark in Canada.  What's up, Mark?  Yes, sir.  Guys, O.P. and Anthony.  How you guys doing, man?  How you doing?  Yeah, shit.  You know, we just got XM Radio over here in Canada, and I'm surprised I listen to your  show every single day religiously for a week now.  How long?  For a week?  Yeah, for exactly a week now.  Yeah, I just picked it up and got on my truck there last...  Did you know about us before you got the XM?  Hell no.  So what happened?  You got XM. 
[02:17:30]  Now, how did you find...  I got XM and, you know, listened to the 80s, the 90s, you know, the cool shit.  Uh-huh.  Oh, I want to say fuck on the radio.  There, I just did, man.  You just did.  Yeah, I did.  That's awesome.  Anyways, yeah, so my colleague at work was saying, oh, have you ever heard of O.P. and  Anthony?  I was like, hell no.  So you had to listen to it, and the first time I listened to your shit was on Friday  with that eggnog crap.  Oh, with the vomiting, yeah.  I'm so lucky I didn't piss and shit in my pants, man, that same day.  I was so funny, and I was like, now I listen to it religiously, and when I woke up this 
[02:18:00]  morning, I heard that news, too, on top of that.  I was like, no way.  I just got into this.  Imagine this guy gets less than a week of our show.  Exactly.  And we get through it.  No way.  Dude, this radio show is a white-knuckle ride, man.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on tight and just enjoy the ride.  And one last thing, I encourage all Canadians to call the show up, man.  Just to be that much more cooler.  I think you guys, the U.S., rock, too.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  But, I mean, we've got to get some Canadians there on the line, too.  Okay.  You're Canada's cute, too.  Yeah.  And do you really stand on guard for thee?  Yeah, I will.  I will.  What the hell does that mean?  Thank you, sir.  I'm at these Islander games where we play the Canadian teams, and I'm like...  Yeah.  And they stand on guard for thee?  Why are you trying?  What does that mean?  It's more the gesture than it is the actual standing on guard for thee.  Standing on guard for thee.  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  Thanks for the help, brother.  From Toronto, I spit my last breath at thee.  He tasks me.  All right, Mark.  Awesome show, guys.  Thanks.  Thank you.  I'm just trying to understand the Canadian national anthem there.  You know, it's a beautiful song, I've got to tell you.  It's just against America.  Anything that you hear thee and the and hockey, aluminium, it's just anti-American.  It's their way of, like, sneakily being down with England.  Hey, those little sneakers on top of me. 
[02:19:30]  I am enjoying the fact that Canada has XM now.  It is opening me up.  I'm kind of a xenophobe.  Wee.  You know?  I'm really not that comfortable around others that aren't like me.  No one's like you.  I'm just not.  God damn.  Everyone is a xenophobe a little bit.  Inca shooting bastard.  No one's like you.  I know.  What can I tell you?  That's right.  I like to think so.  Boy, so that means I feel this way about everybody.  They are nice.  I'm going to tell you, with some about Canada, their niceness is so sincere, it's sickening. 
[02:20:00]  It's like they're the nicest people I've ever met in my life.  And being opened up to it.  Oh, how you doing?  Hey.  Being opened up to the Canadians on the phones here through XM and stuff.  It's giving me a new appreciation for the national anthems, man.  We got the cockiest national anthem in the entire world.  Yeah.  Bombs and shit.  And, Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  Oh, Canada. 
[02:20:30]  That's all I know.  Sorry, Canada.  I'm really trying to learn more.  I learned it from Bret Hart when Bret Hart used to play the Canadian.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that's right.  You know, if we could, we would have Metallica do a brand new national anthem for this country.  That's what people really want to hear.  There we go.  You fuck it.  Well, that would be one.  Do we have the Canadian national anthem anywhere?  No.  I just want to know what the second line is.  Oh, Canada.  Oh, Canada.  We stand on guard for thee. 
[02:21:00]  Is that where we're free?  What?  Oh, Canada.  Wait.  Oh, Canada.  Oh, Canada.  Oh, Canada.  Oh, Canada.  Wait, what?  Oh, Canada.  Oh, I got it.  He's right.  Oh, Canada.  Our.  Home in native land.  Yeah, our home in native land.  There we go.  How do you know?  He's right.  He's right.  He's Canadian.  Who's Canadian?  I stand for the Canadian.  Travis?  Steve.  Steve's a Canadian. 
[02:21:30]  Look at how Travis is like, no, I'm not a fucking Canadian.  Canadian, my ass, man.  Like, he's all pissed off.  No American wants to be mistaken for a Canadian.  I'd rather be a goop than a crookie Canadian, man.  We love Canada.  Hey, guys, fuck the Canada thing.  Oh, wild Susan?  That's right.  Wild Susan.  Hey.  All right.  We got a competition going.  Even the hey sounded a little wild.  It's like, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I like that.  Let me explain what's going on.  Anthony and I are always coming up with bits.  Very clever radio show you're listening to. 
[02:22:00]  And we came up with a brand new bit very recently.  We stayed up all night, actually, coming up with this bit, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Very excited.  We're trying to figure out what this satellite radio could do.  Even a year and three months into it, we're still trying to figure that out.  Right.  And we came up with this bit called Tissue Time.  Yep.  We want women to call up and talk dirty to our listeners.  Oh, yeah.  Like phone sex.  Like phone sex.  Live on the radio.  That's right.  How about that for an original idea that you've never heard anybody... 
[02:22:30]  What the hell picture is that?  It's definitely original, yeah.  It's a very original idea.  It's never been done on radio before.  Right.  To this extent.  And we're looking at your picture, Susan.  Age 28.  Yeah.  Measurements.  38 double Ds.  Yeah.  24-inch waist.  38-inch hips.  Yep.  You're a dark blonde.  Yep.  Hello.  My name is Susan.  Actually, wild Susan, to most of those who know me. 
[02:23:00]  I hope you've been enjoying visiting and talking to my girls.  I have personally taught them in the art of pleasure.  And they all just love pleasing their gentleman callers.  The art of pleasure.  Oh, so you're a professional.  Oh, yeah.  I'm definitely a professional.  Oh, yeah.  How much money do you make talking dirty on the phone?  A lot.  Really?  A lot, yeah.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Okay.  Because we live and learn, too.  I got your beautiful website up here.  Oh.  Wow.  It's just waiting for a plug.  Oh, yeah.  Now, see, if we plug it before you actually perform, I don't know if you're going to perform 
[02:23:30]  as well.  Oh, no.  So, here's the deal.  We want you to have some phone sex with one of our listeners today.  It's going to be Tissue Time with Susan.  And, Susan, if you do a really good job, then we plug your website.  How does that sound?  Sounds great.  And there's a girl out there, Michelle, very pissed off because she wants to be the Tissue  Time girl.  And where are you located?  I'm in Florida.  Florida.  Yes.  Because we want to fly some girls up to do Tissue Time on a future show on 202. 
[02:24:00]  I would do it in a heartbeat.  All right.  You ready, Anthony?  Oh, absolutely.  All right.  Yeah.  We're going to say hi to Ben in Connecticut.  Oh.  It's not Ben from Boston, is it?  No, no, no.  Ben.  What's going on, guys?  How are they?  What's up, Ben?  You ready for some Tissue Time?  Absolutely.  All right.  Where are you, bro?  I am in Connecticut, unfortunately.  Well, no.  Where in Connecticut?  Wallingford.  Wallingford.  All right. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, really narrow it down to, like, square footage.  Right.  What are you in?  A car?  A cubicle?  Yeah.  I am in my living room.  In your living room.  Is anybody?  Home alone.  Home alone.  Home alone.  Oh, you're home alone.  But a home alone jerk.  There he is.  That's why it's called Tissue Time, sir.  Yes, and hopefully I'm going to need a tissue, so.  Well, here's the deal with Tissue Time.  The ultimate goal is to have an ending.  Yeah.  All right.  That's all we're saying.  Like any good porno movie, you need the money shot. 
[02:25:00]  That's right.  Excellent.  Excellent.  We're hoping it's more of a Susan thing.  Yeah, like she could get all worked up.  But here's the beauty with the bit, and this is why it's so brilliant.  Not only is Ben going to get off because Susan's going to talk dirty,  there's going to be listeners all over the country and all over Canada now, Anthony,  that also are going to get off.  Exactly.  And some of them are going to be of the female persuasion.  I think that got Susan a little hot, just the thought of that.  Oh, yeah.  Can you imagine if we could collect the spunk? 
[02:25:30]  Oh, the pile of tissues?  Well, let's just say, how much volume would there be if you added up what Susan could accomplish?  You know what I'm trying to say?  Yes, it would just be buckets full.  You think we could get a gallon done right now?  Oh, more than that. 
[02:26:00]  More than a gallon.  Yeah, more than a gallon.  I want to see what the power is with this whole new medium.  You're thinking if Wild Susan did her job, there will be at least a gallon of...  At least a gallon.  Yeah.  I'm thinking a few, like a few gallons.  If you could collect it through the magic of whatever.  Like five gallons.  Five gallons?  We're nationwide here, my friend.  Holy crap.  Someone do the math.  What do they say is in an orgasm? 
[02:26:30]  A teaspoon?  Half a teaspoon?  What is it?  What's the thing?  Teaspoon, maybe?  I don't know.  No, it's got to be more than a teaspoon.  Tablespoon, maybe?  Well, it depends on how fast you want to eat it.  Well, one of the smarter listeners, we know you're out there.  Some of the mathematicians, figure it out for us.  Yeah.  A small turkey baster.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's all you think.  All right.  A bottle of Flonase.  Hey, the girls on your site are really hot, too.  Gallons.  Are they the real girls? 
[02:27:00]  Some girls play themselves.  Some girls don't.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  But I've been with a lot of them, so...  All right.  Let's do tissue time with Wild Susan.  Ben, you ready?  Yes.  I mean, are you ready?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to be quiet now.  It's time for our brand new, brilliant bit, never been done before in this way, on any  type of radio.  Oh, hell no.  It's tissue time with Susan today.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, baby? 
[02:27:30]  Hey.  Hey, Ben.  They call me at the perfect time, because I'm just laying here in my bed.  Nice.  Nice.  Do you like getting head?  Oh, yeah.  I love giving head.  When did you start?  Well, wait, wait.  I just went to lay back, and I went to kind of watch and play with my pussy a little bit.  Nice.  Because I got my vibrator, and I've just been fucking myself all morning waiting for your  call.  Oh, that's hot.  Yeah.  I'm just going in and out, in and out, in and out. 
[02:28:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  I want you to watch me, Ben.  Nice.  You like that?  Yeah.  I love it.  Yeah.  Pull your cock out and let me see how hard...  Yeah.  I made your cock.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  No.  Come over here, and I'm going to open my mouth wide and say, ah.  Open wide, baby.  Yeah.  I do things a little bit different, Ben.  I start from the bottom up.  Nice.  Yeah.  I'll start licking your ass and going all the way up the shaft and giving you the best 
[02:28:30]  blowjob you've ever had.  Nice.  Yeah.  I have a talent.  I suck really fucking hard.  I'm making those popping, sucking fucking noises.  Hot.  Yeah.  I have to open my mouth really wide and slide your cock down the back of my throat, and  you can just bob my head up and down any way you want me, Ben.  Ah.  You like a girl that swallows, Ben?  Yes. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Well, I'm...  Swallow it.  Yeah.  Why spit and waste it when I can swallow and taste it, Ben?  Yes.  Full of vitamin me.  Grab the back of my ponytail and just bob my head up and down and up and down and up and  down.  And I'm going to take my fingernails and kind of rake them on your balls.  Nice.  Yeah.  I love the feeling of a big hard cock down the back of my throat.  Nice.  Yeah.  You can play with my pussy while I'm fucking sucking your hard cock.  Nice.  I like your pussy. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  Get me off, Ben.  I want to come.  I want to come.  You just fucking explode my mouth.  I want to come.  Same fucking time.  Mm-mm.  Yeah.  I got this vibrator deep in my pussy going faster and faster.  In and out.  Oh, in and out.  Come on, baby.  Talk to me.  Oh, man.  Make me fucking explode.  Yeah.  Push your cock in my mouth and push this vibe in my fucking pussy faster and faster. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  You like that, baby?  You like watching me play it myself?  Yeah, baby.  I want to make you calm.  Come on.  Come on, baby.  I want to make you calm, baby.  Come on.  I'm going to go faster.  I'm going to take this big fucking vibe and just stick it up my ass.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  This really will make me explode.  Yeah.  Mm-mm.  Yeah.  Mm-mm.  I want you to fucking calm all over my big fucking tits.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Mm-mm.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Come on.  Here.  Take a look.  Come on.  Wait.  In and out.  You're fucking faster.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Are you going to hear me calm?  I'm going to fucking calm all over your fucking cock, Ben.  Yes.  Mm-mm.  Come.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to come.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  You pussy all nice and wet, baby.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  It's really fucking wet.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Good.  Ben, you sound like an ass. 
[02:31:30]  I'm sorry, guys.  I had to do it.  I had to do it.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Yeah, the guys seem to, like, like the chicks, but the guys really are upset with the guy's  performance any time.  Ben really did sound like fucking Jeff Spicoli.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice.  Carly.  Oh, dude.  Is it wet, baby?  She just came, asshole.  What happened?  She's like, oh, yeah. 
[02:32:00]  And, and, oh, Ben, I want to suck your cock.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, uh-oh.  My, my vibrator's broken.  Relax.  All right?  My old man is a television repairman.  Got the ultimate set of tools.  I can fix it.  That was hot.  Man, I came sorry.  Oh, well, uh, you know, one time I had two guys at the same time. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, those guys are fat.  Poor Ben.  That was a lot of pressure, though.  It's just, like, on national radio to be like.  I'll let you fuck my pussy and, and I'll suck your cock.  But don't stick it in my ass.  Hey, bud, what's your problem?  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  He's like, oh, I'm coming, too.  I think.  All right, Hamilton.  Someone is, uh, someone gets it on the instant feedback. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, go back.  Oh, where was that?  Oh, come on, man.  Darn it.  Basically, just before Susan, you know, starts coming.  Yeah.  You hear, please deposit.  $0.25 for the next three minutes.  You want to pay for this?  Uh, Chris in Boston, what's up?  Yo, man, I think Michelle's better.  For a professional, uh, I don't know.  I was a little bit disappointed.  Yeah?  Maybe it's because of the Allison and Beth thing that really put it over the top, but I think 
[02:33:30]  I think Michelle was doing a better job.  I thought Susan did a pretty good job.  I thought the, uh, the orgasm part was a little fake sounding there.  She was a little over the top.  I don't know if she was getting ax murdered or something in the background.  I mean, she was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Yeah, so, you know.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yep.  Where is Michelle today?  We need Michelle as well.  Uh, Anthony in Jersey.  Yeah, I'd like to do it.  I, uh, I want to go as Howard, though, and have her be a big black woman that does nothing 
[02:34:00]  for me.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Carol.  Carol, what's up?  Hey.  Just want to say, this is my first day back with you after not hearing you for a couple  years, and it's absolutely brilliant, just like it used to be.  Oh, thank you.  And through the magic of cell phones, I just shared that wonderful experience with my husband.  Oh, really?  Fantastic, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Love it.  Keep it up.  Carol.  All right.  People love the bit.  They do love the bit.  Uh, Susan, you're going to be laying around naked? 
[02:34:30]  Maybe we'll do one more?  Oh, great.  I'm here.  All right.  Um, and, and, you know, that was the first one.  She's done for the show, so, uh, we've noticed, uh, from other girls that they get better.  That's right.  As they go on.  Michelle's first one was okay, and then she really upped her game the second time around.  All right.  Hold on the line there, Susan.  Okay.  There it is.  You need a guy that's, she's going to do more than just say, yeah.  Man, that's, that's a very nervous thing, though.  Just, you know, you know, you're waiting for somebody to go, let me hear it. 
[02:35:00]  I always like to say, let me, let me, let me hear it.  Let me hear it.  Let me hear it.  Talk.  Give me a little.  Yeah.  Just some proof.  Give me some proof.  John C. from, uh, Columbus, Ohio.  Holy shit.  I'm at work trying to, trying to type a fucking email.  At one point, I typed come instead of come.  It wasn't bad.  I like her, too, man.  She's definitely a black girl's white girl, a black guy's white girl, that bitch.  She's a, she's juicy.  It really wasn't bad.  Man, everyone is yawning around here today. 
[02:35:30]  It was a long night for a lot of people.  Okay.  We got a couple things we could do.  We got, uh, we got the gangster fag we're supposed to play for Patrice.  I didn't hear that.  It's really, uh, hardcore rapper.  Hardcore gay rapper.  Huh?  I like that white girl, man.  Big old titties.  You like the white, oh, she's got to get her plug in.  I'm sorry.  We made a promise here.  Wild Susan.  Susan?  I'm here.  What the hell was that in the background?  Are you on the toilet?  No.  No.  Did she's frying eggs? 
[02:36:00]  Did anyone else hear that?  Yeah, I heard it, too.  She's frying eggs.  I heard that, too.  I didn't know what it was.  Clunking going on.  Then she's lying, a little sneaky bitch.  Oh, what?  Oh, oh, oh.  You just dropped eggs.  I thought it was the beginning of a mudslide.  She ain't in the bathroom, because that means she's, oh, I'm, if she was smart, she would  have said, oh, yes, I'm just cleaning off my twatty here, my crevasse.  You got a black boyfriend, Pumpkin?  No.  You like black guys, or you're racist?  That's the only choice.  I like them all. 
[02:36:30]  Okay, start with the phone sex thing for a second.  Do you, do you, do black guys really come on to you, right, because you're a big, juicy  one, right?  Yeah, all guys love my body.  Stop with all guys.  White guys don't like that fucking giant titties.  They don't.  You've never seen a white guy with a big titties?  Really?  They don't.  They don't.  No, she's too big for us.  Yeah?  You know what?  Black guy written all over.  Black guy written all over, and she doesn't like us like she should.  Mark the trucker.  Mark?  Mark.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  What's up, Mark?  Go.  I just want to say, I think Susan has Michelle beat hands down. 
[02:37:00]  She's definitely a pro.  Just want to say, man, I've been listening a couple months, and this is one of the funniest.  I love it.  Driving down the road with a smile, man.  All right, right on.  All right, Mark.  All right.  All right, later.  Later.  You don't even want to know what was going on in those trucks today.  Yeah.  Don't even want to know.  Hey, Wild Susan, why don't we get your plug in?  Okay.  What's the website?  Oh, it's naughtybutnice.com with two T's.  Naughty but nice. 
[02:37:30]  You know, like butt, B-U-T-T.  Yes.  Naughtybutnice.com.  Dot com.  There you have it.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Did a bang up job there.  Thank you.  We might call you back for one more today, okay?  Okay, I'm here.  All right, there she goes.  See what?  LickMyWetThumb.com.  Wild Susan, everyone.  I'm going to slowly shove it.  You think we can take a quick break and then we can do like maybe Gangsta Fag or that,  oh, those annoying songs from yesterday, too.  Oh, we didn't get to that.  All right, we could do some show today. 
[02:38:00]  So much.  We're regrouping.  Right in front of your eyes.  Mm-hmm.  All right, we'll be back.  Dirk, get us out of here.  Dirk, get us out of here. 
[02:38:30]  Dirk, get us out of here.  Dirk, get us out of here.  With a mouth one day.  She'll flash it.  She'll flash it.  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash it.  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  With a mouth one day.  Nice and fresh.  Hey.  Shots of movies.  This is what it's all about.  With a mouth one day.  Oh, I love this.  Shots of movies.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Whip them fuckers out.  This is fantastic.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[02:39:30]  That's why we call it wow.  Talk about the poopies.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Take your balls and take it off now.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out. 
[02:40:00]  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  And we're back with the O.P. Anthony program.  Patrice O'Neill sitting in today, doing a great job. 
[02:40:30]  He'll be here the rest of the week.  Or will I?  Or will I?  Or will he, yes.  Rich Voss was supposed to join the program today.  And we were going to go over his John Davidson TV appearance from, I don't know, 1990 or something.  But Voss was in a car accident.  Where's Ben?  And he totaled his Mercedes.  It's a true story.  Oh, no.  Maybe we should get Voss on the phone to see what the hell's going on.  He totaled it?  It could run into the hundreds of dollars. 
[02:41:00]  Supposedly he totaled his Mercedes.  He's some shit.  He's okay, but I think he was going to the doctor today to make sure everything's all right.  Trying to go to the doctor.  Did his teeth fly out and go through the windshield?  Maybe he was too distracted, trying to keep those teeth in his mouth.  I could drive with one hand.  I'm going to hold my teeth in one of the other.  Probably answering a call from Bonnie.  Maybe he'll call the show before we get off the air.  If not, hopefully tomorrow, okay?  And instant feedback going nuts, Anthony.  Darren in England.  Leeds England, by the way. 
[02:41:30]  Hello.  Tissue time.  Man, you guys are creative.  How do you come up with such amazing ideas?  Well, that's the work that goes behind the show.  I've got to explain, Anthony.  Recently, I was outside my childhood home.  Uh-huh.  Looking at my childhood home, wishing I had a better childhood.  Looking at that house that I know was a better house than most of the listeners,  but I still wished I had a better childhood.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Yeah.  And I was in my Boy Scout uniform that I just happened to have. 
[02:42:00]  Uh-huh.  Were you in the Boy Scouts?  Well, I was back in the day, but I, you know, I grew out of the Boy Scout uniform,  so I figured I would buy an adult-sized Boy Scout uniform.  And I have it in the closet, just in case.  You never know when you need to dress up like a Boy Scout.  You never know.  So I'm outside my childhood home, just wishing I had a better childhood.  Looking at that house that I know is better than most of the listeners' houses that they had growing up.  And I was there in my Boy Scout uniform with a little tear in my eye. 
[02:42:30]  Aw.  And I was thinking, man, you know, we have this unbelievable opportunity on satellite radio.  What aren't we doing?  Yeah.  What aren't we doing with this satellite radio?  And you know what?  Just thinking and thinking and thinking, and bam, it hit me.  Just hit me out of nowhere.  Tissue time.  Tissue time.  That's what you do with all this talent.  Tissue time.  Tissue time with Michelle.  Tissue time with Susan. 
[02:43:00]  Tissue time.  Tissue time.  Michelle.  Yeah, guys.  Everyone's saying that you're better than Susan.  Oh, you had another.  I couldn't catch it today or yesterday.  So that's good, though.  That's good.  Well, everyone is saying you're better than Susan, but you might have to prove it today.  Are you?  Do you have one in you?  Yeah, totally.  All right.  Hold on.  Totally.  Hold on the line for a second, because we've got a couple things going on here.  Dan in Montana.  Dan?  Hey, how's it going, man? 
[02:43:30]  I thought Michelle was way better.  That other guy made me want to drive into a tree.  You want her to do a little tissue time with you today?  Dude, I'm at work.  That probably wouldn't be good working around a bunch of oil field guys.  All right.  No worries.  But you're one of the many that thought Michelle was better.  Let's ask Bill what he has for the program.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, I was just wondering if Voss was telling a joke when he crashed his car.  Very good.  Speaking of Harker, speaking of Rich Voss, we'll get back to Michelle in a second. 
[02:44:00]  But on our phones, Rich Voss.  Rich?  Hey, how's it going?  First of all, how are you?  You all right?  I'm in pain.  My neck is killing me.  My car is wrecked.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let us know exactly what happened.  Where were you driving?  What was the road, direction, where did the other car come from?  Give it to me like I'm the insurance agent.  Well, here's the thing.  I was going into the Somerville Circle, which is a nightmare.  It's the worst circle in Jersey, I'm sure. 
[02:44:30]  Do you know you must yield the right of way to people in the circle?  Yeah, but there's one, two, three, four, five entrances into the circle.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  So I go to go into the circle, and I stopped, ready to merge.  I'm just sitting there, and bam, the loudest, the whole, like a truck came flying into me.  And I just, I jerked forward.  My coffee, everything flew.  And it was like just a big daze and stuff. 
[02:45:00]  Well, now, wait a minute.  You were in the circle?  No, I was sitting waiting to get into the circle.  You were waiting to get into the circle.  No one in front of you, just the circle?  Yeah, yeah, you know.  So you're sitting there, all right, you're stepping on the brake.  Now, who hit you, and from where?  Some truck.  I think it was from, like, Missouri or somewhere.  He goes, I just moved here.  Did he rear-end you?  If I'm parked, yeah, yeah, he rear-ended me into the car.  Bam.  Right behind.  So you got rear-ended, and then got pushed out into the circle? 
[02:45:30]  No, I didn't get pushed out into a circle.  Like, right when I got smashed, I hit the brake.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, then it was like a blur.  I'm sure that helped the impact, by the way.  Well, what?  Yeah, I know.  Didn't he hit you from behind?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Why would you get the brake going?  What's that?  Let it roll you a little bit.  I guess he didn't want to fly out into the circle and get T-boned.  It's kind of like a blur, because you just hear a big, loud bang.  Right.  You know, and then you just, you know, next thing you know, like, I pulled over to the 
[02:46:00]  side, like, right where the circle, like, getting onto the circle, and then pulled over  right there, like, on the side, and by, like, an island, and, like, I was in such a daze.  It's not funny.  You said the same words eight times.  I have a feeling this is some kind of crack stunt you're pulling balls.  I guarantee you.  I'll go take a picture of it right now and email.  Take a picture of your car.  Do it.  I want proof.  We need some, I'm in a daze.  Now, what happens?  What do you expect?  What do you expect?  Take a picture.  We need new stuff on our website. 
[02:46:30]  Trust me.  You have whiplash, too?  But he's also talking like this.  What's that?  Oh, he sounds like he's trying to stay home from school.  Oh, I was really, I have a new appreciation for life.  I saw my life flash.  So many of my priorities changed in a split second.  Is that you?  Is that you?  Buh, buh, buh, buddy.  It's not about me being funny anymore.  I want to be a better father and a better husband.  Everything.  I just, it all turned around right then. 
[02:47:00]  I saw a bright flash of light and then I saw Rich and Bonnie at Rascals.  They won't let Bonnie work Rascals.  They said she's too dirty.  I saw a flash of light.  It was my teeth flying out into the windshield.  I saw the dim light calling me.  Unfortunately, it was a really crappy comedy club in Pittsburgh.  It was a shape.  The airbag deployed and was punctured by my teeth so it didn't do much help. 
[02:47:30]  What happened to the other guy's vehicle?  Pretty much nothing.  It was a truck.  A truck, like a big truck, tractor-trailer or a...  No, like a 4x4 or whatever.  A pickup?  Yeah, a pickup.  A pickup truck?  Yeah.  It hit you.  And what happened to your Mercedes?  The back is all smashed.  I can't even open the trunk.  All the light.  Smashed apart and I was very injured.  Someone wants to know, did your teeth stay in during impact? 
[02:48:00]  Did what?  Did your teeth stay in?  Because you couldn't even tell a joke on the air the other day without your teeth falling out.  So I'm imagining that your teeth are falling out.  Did they fly to the back of your throat?  I got those re-glued.  Oh, you did?  Right when I left the studio.  Oh, that would have been hilarious.  Yeah.  That would have been really hilarious.  Hilarious.  You know, I mean, I'm going to go take a picture of it.  All right.  You're all right, though?  You got the whiplash?  Is there going to be a court case?  Is Mr. Brady going to have to throw the briefcase to make sure you're not faking? 
[02:48:30]  Watch you turn your head really quick?  I don't know.  No.  Someone got it.  Forget it.  Did you go to the doctor?  What are you talking about?  Did you go to the doctor?  No, I'm going to go today.  I'm going to try.  I got to go to Miami.  Where were you on your way to?  I had to go to Staples and to Circuit City.  See, that doesn't sound important.  Here's what you needed to do, Rich.  What's that?  As a Jew, you should have known this. 
[02:49:00]  What's that?  You call an ambulance immediately.  An ambulance.  Have them take you to the hospital from the accident site and immediately file a lawsuit.  You would be rolling in the dough.  You wouldn't have to live off of Bonnie McFarlane anymore.  I don't think you should be giving that type of advice out today.  Oh, not today?  No, not today.  That's good advice for tomorrow.  True.  What are you doing?  Well, here's the deal.  Do you have a neck brace on?  No, not now.  I didn't go to the doctor yet.  Oh, you're all right, Dan. 
[02:49:30]  Why are we worried about our friend?  I'm going to take a picture on my phone.  All right.  And I'm going to send you guys in.  You know, and this is, you know, a funny...  Look, man.  Rich, were you...  No, I know it's not a funny thing, and we care about you as a friend, but listen, we  got a girl that wants to jerk off guys today.  We got to go.  All right.  All right.  Oh.  There goes, Rich.  There's nothing wrong with Rich.  Yeah?  All right.  That voice was the same one you used.  I'm not going to make it into work today.  I really don't feel good. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Nobody even says like that.  When you're really hurt, you try to sound not hurt.  Yeah.  You're like, yo, what's up, man?  You got...  You all right?  Yeah, I'm good.  I'm good.  Yeah, yeah, fine.  I'm in...  I'm dazed and confused.  Michelle?  Yeah.  Everything was a haze.  Would you like to do tissue time with Michelle with a guy from Michigan or Tennessee?  Michigan.  Michigan.  Yeah, remember, she doesn't like the southern accents.  I'm not giving up on the southern accent guys, though, man.  No. 
[02:50:30]  Ken, where are you?  Hey, I'm here.  Are you in your car?  I'm driving my truck.  You're driving...  Oh, God.  This is the guy from Michigan?  Yeah.  Yep.  Oh, God.  How are you going to take care of business driving your truck?  Oh, I can.  Well, that's a little dangerous, Anthony.  Well, let's talk to the other guy.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  Maybe Dan is...  Dan?  Hey, Dan.  Yeah.  You're in Tennessee?  That's right. 
[02:51:00]  You're in a truck, too, huh?  No.  Oh, you're in a car?  I'm pulling over.  No.  Is that all right?  You're pulling over?  Yeah.  Do you want to play tissue time?  Sure.  I'm going to score.  Yeah, I don't like either of these guys.  Wow.  He's going to score.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we're going to get some chicks.  They're on hold, but Michelle doesn't like either guy. 
[02:51:30]  No.  No.  Need new guys.  You need new guy?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, somebody not in a truck.  That would be nice.  Perhaps.  That would be very nice.  All right.  Michelle?  Yeah.  She's still there.  Oh.  What you got on there today?  Where are you?  I am at my house.  Uh-huh.  Actually, I skipped class, so I'm just in here.  You all woke me up when you called, so I happen to be naked.  All right.  Hold on the line, because we're going to get some guys. 
[02:52:00]  We've got to screen the calls real fast.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Michelle is naked.  Her picture is up on whack bag, by the way.  Yeah, it is.  Uh, topless shot of your big, big boobies.  Your big, full, luscious boobies.  Wow.  She's a big girl, man.  Hey, can you get, uh, any more pictures?  I can.  I, well, um...  You're becoming a star right in front of our eyes.  I know, I know.  I'm excited.  I appreciate it.  Why don't you send a second picture?  Yeah.  Um, let me try and find one for you.  Let these pictures trickle in, by the way. 
[02:52:30]  Don't blow your load.  Don't send us 20 pictures.  Just give them a little taste every day.  Right.  A little bit.  A little bit.  All right.  Hold on there.  We're screening to try to...  That's a great, uh, you know, you...  How about New Mexico?  New Mexico?  Shh.  Uh, Gabriel.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Where are you?  I'm in New Mexico.  And are you in your house?  No, I'm at work.  I am on reservation. 
[02:53:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  Not reservation.  No.  What's your nationality?  I'm American.  You are American Indian.  You sound like a beaner.  You are Mexican.  I'm a beaner.  Are you Mexican?  Sir.  Sir?  Gabriel.  Oh, he's panicking.  Were we too racist to him?  I don't know.  You asked the wrong question.  Listen, Travis has screened the calls.  He'll get a, uh...  You can't divulge that.  He'll get someone for tissue time.  But Steve just handed this in.  Tippi Tom sings the hits. 
[02:53:30]  Remember when he was in here singing?  Oh, bravo.  I wanted to hear this.  We got to hear this really fast.  We'll do this as we try to get someone for tissue time with his shell.  Tippi Tom sings the hits.  Listen to this.  From Stinko Records, it's the new collection of covers from America's favorite derelict.  I'm the original golden bunny.  Tippi Tom.  Regurgitated.  Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love.  He's drunk.  He's drunk.  Smells like feet.  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten most of the lyrics. 
[02:54:00]  Tippi Tom regurgitated.  Chews up your favorite pop hits.  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's a lady.  And spews them back out dirtier, grittier, and stinkier than farts and old beer.  But the lady is mine.  Or something like that.  From your favorite haunting melodies.  Riders on the storm. 
[02:54:30]  Something like that.  To your most cherished classic rock cut.  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Tippi Tom hunkers down, craps all over him, and refuses to wipe.  Trying to sit the night on fire.  And if you act now, you'll receive Tippi Tom's tribute to the town he calls home.  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Start spreading the news.  It's old blue eyes.  I'm leaving today.  Meets old crusty eyes. 
[02:55:00]  I'm gonna be a part of it.  New York, New York.  It's a sappy salute to the city that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams,  and left him blowing strange men for cheap wine in the Port Authority bus terminal.  If I can make it here, I can make it.  Tippi Tom.  Anywhere.  Regurgitated.  It's up to you, New York. 
[02:55:30]  New York.  That's my vote.  Wrapped in a special carrying case, brown in the back, yellow in the front.  Just like Tom's underwear.  Call 1-800-NO-T-CELL right now for your copy of Tippi Tom.  Regurgitated.  Any more requests?  Hey, Steve.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Martini Steve, everyone.  God damn, don't put that somewhere where we can't play it every day.  All right.  That is a hit. 
[02:56:00]  That is a hit.  I love his comments.  That's all.  That's what you get.  Something like that.  Something like that.  Something like that.  All right.  The town that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams.  Anthony.  Oh, that's bad.  Let me tell you how great and brilliant this new bit, Tisha Time, is.  Yes, yes, please.  The phones are so fucked up right now because everyone is trying to get through to Play Tissue  Time.  It crashed the phone screening program.  I see a bunch of calls. 
[02:56:30]  Can we just answer them or what?  We can do it that way, at least?  That they are trying to screen through.  All right.  Let me see what's going on here.  All right.  They still work, at least.  Who's this?  What's up?  All right.  Hello.  Who's this?  Hey, this is Rick.  Rick, where are you calling from?  Boston.  Boston.  You want to play Tissue Time?  Actually, I'm driving right now, so I can't, but I've got to call the professor out on something.  The professor?  Professor Anthony?  Oh, yes.  Yes, sir.  I am the professor because I know a little bit about a lot of things. 
[02:57:00]  That doesn't necessarily mean, people get confused sometimes, that I know everything  about everything.  I just know a little bit about a lot of things.  So if you're calling me out on something, you could very well be right, sir.  What are you calling me out on?  Sir, I just want to say that you flubbed the intro to Tissue Time Sings the Hits.  You said Tissue Time.  Oh, but that's not him.  Did I say Tissue Time?  Sir, wouldn't that just be something that could possibly happen, that we've been talking about 
[02:57:30]  Tissue Time, and I said Tissue Time.  You ever do that in your life, ever?  Yes, but Anthony, I kind of like ruined the erection that I had going.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, man.  Sorry, sir.  Boy, what a picky, picky guy that was.  That's a picky listener right there.  You said Tissue Time.  Jeremy in Idaho.  What's up, Jeremy?  Sometimes no one calls me out on it quickly.  Sorry, Anthony.  Sometimes no one calls me out on stuff like that, which is fine.  But then I get home and listen to the replay, and I go, I said Tissue Time? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  What a fucking idiot.  And then you get that, like.  I call myself out.  Then you get the flop sweat and stuff.  You get all hot.  Yeah.  A lot of times I listen to the replays of this show, and I'm like, oh, God.  Oh, my God.  I attempted that on the show.  Oh, what an idiot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jeremy in Idaho.  Jeremy.  Yeah.  Hey, bro.  Hey, what's up?  Well, this guy sounds all right so far, right?  Yeah, I want to play some Tissue Time, baby.  Where are you?  I'm in Austin, Utah. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  That's a big place.  Could you narrow it down a little bit?  Serial food?  All right.  Could you maybe narrow down?  Are you in a room?  I'm in a truck.  In a truck.  Okay.  So you're driving?  Yeah.  No, I ain't driving.  I'm parking the way to unload.  Are you willing to really play Tissue Time?  Oh, buddy.  I'm willing and ready.  All right.  Michelle.  That's a little lackluster. 
[02:59:00]  Really?  Not into the Jeremy guy?  No.  Well, I'm no judge being a guy, but I would think Michelle wouldn't like...  Michelle?  Your listeners are terrible today.  I got to tell you, the phones are exploding.  All right.  Hold on, Jeremy.  We've really got to find someone good here.  Let's go to Mike in St. Louis.  Mike?  Yeah.  She loves Michaels.  I know it.  I heard her yesterday.  Sounds a little creepy.  All right.  Hey, I'm ready to get on top of Michelle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  Let's do this. 
[02:59:30]  With Mike?  Yeah.  I'm ready.  Yeah.  I'm ready.  I'm ready, Michelle.  Because you know what?  He's ready.  I don't know.  I think he's putting on like a fake voice.  Mike, what are you doing?  No, this is my voice.  This is my voice.  He's from where?  St. Louis?  St. Louis?  Missouri.  That's right.  Missouri.  That's right.  That's right.  Are you a black guy?  Yes, sir.  And I got a long one, too, but I think I'm ready to run Michelle in.  You sound like a dude from a family guy, a black actor from a family guy.  Yeah.  Well, I'm ready to do Michelle right now.  She did me yesterday. 
[03:00:00]  She had me walking around with a boner all day yesterday.  It's my turn.  So now you want in.  Now you want in.  I'm going to make her come.  Michelle, what do you think?  It's fine.  All right.  This has a potential to be really ugly.  She likes the black guy here.  No, it's not even that.  I'm going to teach her.  I'm going to teach her what to do.  I'm going to teach her.  Well, here's the problem, Mike.  Here's the problem right off the bat.  We want to hear more girl.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I understand.  We want to hear mostly girl quite frankly.  I know exactly what you want.  You give me a chance.  You watch the phone. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, God.  Watch the phone later.  All right.  Michelle, you want to do it with Mike from St. Louis?  If you guys don't think that I should, then I won't, but I have no freaking idea.  What's your feel?  Well, I just think it'll be funny.  Well, all right, funny, but we also want erotic because there's a lot of guys with tissues  in their hands right now.  It's called tissue time.  I've got it out.  I'm going.  I'm ready for Michelle.  All right.  Go ahead, Michelle.  All right.  What did you say your name was?  Michael?  Yeah, my name is Michael. 
[03:01:00]  Okay, Michael.  All right.  How do you want me today?  Oh, you know what I like, Michelle?  I like my nipples pinched.  You like your nipples pinched?  Oh, yeah.  You like me?  And you like me to play with your chest and rub your nipples?  Oh, yeah.  Just like that.  Just like that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'll sit on top of you, play with your nipples, on my hot, wet pussy, sitting right  on top of your nice, really hard black cock. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You got a fake face, dude.  Rubbing slowly, getting you all excited.  Yeah.  What else do you like?  Come on, baby.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Let me see how much you can take.  I can take it all, baby.  See that slide right in my nice pussy.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  Come on.  Your cock is so fucking big.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking smack me.  Oh, God. 
[03:02:00]  I got your whole ass in my hand.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You like that ass, don't you?  Oh, God.  You're damn right.  I like it.  Come on.  Let me feel your cock.  Oh.  Grinding up and down on you.  Oh.  Oh.  Fucking smacking.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on.  You like that, Mike? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah?  Don't stop.  Oh.  Come on.  Oh.  Come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Your cock feels so good.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's what I'm doing.  Oh, shit.  Yeah?  Oh, man.  Baby, damn.  Thank you.  Oh, my dear.  Uh-oh.  You're going to run. 
[03:03:00]  Best run.  That stuff isn't allowed to go on in St. Louis, Mike.  They got laws against that in St. Louis.  Hell, that was good shit.  All right, Mike.  Get out of here.  Jesus.  I didn't like that exchange.  No?  No.  Well, it was a little bland.  I don't like the starting off with the pinching nipple thing. 
[03:03:30]  That's a Norton thing.  Norton's into that.  God.  All right, Michelle, we might call you back, all right?  That's fine.  Stay close and stay naked.  I will.  There she goes, Michelle.  It's tissue time with Michelle, everyone.  You want to get Leo in here?  Sure.  Should we take a break or go right to it?  Let's go right to it.  We got a tech guy coming in.  Derek, very excited.  Bill, very excited.  Well, maybe they should come in and conduct the interview.  Yeah, where's Bill?  Hey, Leo.  Hey, how you doing?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Good.  We're having a crazy show today, so bear with us. 
[03:04:00]  I'll fit right in.  Some of our guys are very excited that you're here today.  Yeah, the nerds are.  Including Bill right here.  The nerds.  The geeks are happy.  Hey, who's that?  Who's who?  The guy with the beard and stuff.  The new morning show.  Holy.  Isn't that a rapper?  That's the Hasidic rapper?  Yeah.  That guy is all over the place lately.  Can he do a little something for us?  Find out if that's the guy.  Sorry, Leo.  No, that's okay.  If I had a Hasidic rapper, I'd go with it, too. 
[03:04:30]  This guy's got a buzz.  This guy's got a buzz on him, man.  Yeah.  He's a Hasidic Jew that raps.  I've heard about him.  But people are taking him seriously.  Anyway, Bill's in studio, and he knows you, Leo, and he was very excited that you were  coming in today.  He's a geek.  Now, where do you know him from?  Back before it was G4, I used to watch ZDTV, and he did a show on, like, two shows.  He did Screensavers and Call for Help, and I used to watch those shows for a few years.  When I was sick home, I used to watch it all.  I actually watched those shows. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, there you go.  All right.  I'm sure.  Why once?  No, no.  It would be funny, because wasn't it live?  Yeah.  And you would get some phone calls in there that were a little inappropriate sometimes.  Not that often.  Not that often.  Geeks are rarely highly inappropriate.  There's a couple of times, or at least, like, there was some kind of double entendre thing  that would happen sometimes.  Yeah, I had a bad problem with that.  Yeah.  And then what happened to you?  What happened to me?  Yeah, because the channel got sold to Comcast, and they kind of gutted it.  And I actually go to Canada to do the TV show up there. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, very cool.  You're very cold, actually, yeah.  We're on XM Canada now, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And what did you like about the show most, Bill?  I liked how, well, nowadays, G4 is all about, like, video games and anime and stupid shit,  and it's like, it just became like a really...  You're not a fan of anime?  I used to be, but I don't like the channel now.  The channel used to be a lot about actual tech and learning.  Computers.  Yes.  Yeah, more so than just games. 
[03:06:00]  Now it's like this whole geek culture, and it's really full of itself.  You can see why it's gone now, right?  No, I kind of like that, you know?  There are people who call up and ask you a question about how to fix some stuff.  You know what's happened is it's all gone to the podcast arena now.  Yeah.  Because we don't have to worry about, you know, we just do what we want,  and if people want to hear it, they listen.  If they don't, they don't.  And then we're actually doing it really well.  The podcast is starting to take on.  Yeah, like Sexy Girl on that show?  No.  No?  The TV show we did.  Yeah, the TV show.  Yeah, the producers kept bringing it.  They said, you know what you need?  None of this show needs is more cleavage. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  And that's when I left.  Well, I have cleavage, but not the right kind.  Not the right kind, no.  Man boobs did not.  What the sexiness on there.  They weren't looking for it.  Is that when they brought in Morgan?  Yeah.  Morgan, and you see, he knows.  Yeah.  He knows.  He knows the ladies.  She had blonde hair.  She was a redhead.  We had Sarah, who kind of would go back and forth from blonde.  Well, Morgan was blonde and then black, and then there was Jessica, who was the redhead.  I mean, when he's starting to sound like a...  And that kind of got...  Well, that kind of got people to take notice. 
[03:07:00]  You know, our podcasts are 97% male.  So...  And that probably was true of the TV show, too.  So you've got to keep it sexy with the female thing.  Well, you know what's big on that channel now is the man show.  They've got the trampolines.  They're buying old man shows and showing them, and it's doing...  Yeah, not the new one.  They're doing old man shows, and it's doing better than anything else that we've done on the channel.  That's rough.  You know, girls on trampolines just doesn't get old, right?  I gather not, but if you're looking for some kind of tech thing... 
[03:07:30]  If you're looking for content, it's not good.  No.  So we do, like, really content now on the podcast.  That's really...  And, you know, we have a quarter of a million listeners on one of the podcasts.  And is it people asking questions about...  No, well, we haven't...  Because it's not live, we can't really do that yet.  Yeah, it's a little rough.  So we do some questions, but mostly it's just a bunch of people pontificating, you know, talking...  Talking tech.  ...with their butts, yeah.  And what's the hot subjects right now?  Well, you know, I'm sure you guys must have talked about the Sony fiasco.  The rootkit thing?  Did you guys talk about that at all?  With the CDs... 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, the copy protection of the CDs.  They were putting out that if you played them on your computer or tried to put them on your iPod 3 or computer, a virus...  Well, it wasn't exactly a virus.  They put this...  They used this hacker technique called a rootkit to hide what they were doing, right?  So nobody would see it.  Because, well, the pirates will see it.  The irony of all of this is the pirates totally understand all this stuff.  They can...  What can they not steal, right?  It doesn't stop anybody who's actually actively doing illegal stuff. 
[03:08:30]  Who does it stop?  Who does it inconvenience?  It's just the average guy like myself.  Normal people.  I don't know that.  I don't know how to get around that shit.  If you listen to one of these BMG discs ever on your computer, you've got something on your computer that any hacker, 12-year-old hacker can use now to invade your computer without your knowledge.  No antivirus can see it.  No spyware can see it.  Yeah.  It's really awful.  This, Patrice, we're talking like another language, right?  It is, yeah.  Patrice has rolled away from the microphone.  He's got his arms folded.  He's gone to sleep.  He's gone to sleep.  The body language here is very negative.  He cannot. 
[03:09:00]  But the instant feedback is going nuts.  People can't believe you're on the show right now.  They're freaking out.  I have.  They're saying something about how they missed the screensavers.  Yeah.  See, the geek army, you've got to understand, is huge.  Yeah.  Well, we kind of understand that.  We embrace the geeks on this show.  Good.  They get a lot done for us.  Screensavers was another one of those shows.  I did two shows, Call for Help and the Screensavers.  The one that he's talking about, the one with the girls, was the screensavers.  Screensavers, right.  And what was that, basically?  Same thing.  People calling in, answering questions.  Same shows, same show, different things.  Same show.  In fact, that's exactly how the genesis is. 
[03:09:30]  I used to do call-in radio.  And they said, well, can you do that on TV?  I said, yeah.  They said, how many hours can you do?  Because this is when we were first launching.  You've got to do a 24-hour network.  You've got to fill it.  And I said, well, I used to do as many as eight hours a day, but I don't think I really  want to do that.  And they said, well, can you do two shows?  And I said, yeah.  Well, we'll kind of make one for more beginners, one for more advanced.  So Screensavers was for the real enthusiasts.  You know, the guy who's like this guy here, who's really into this stuff.  Yeah, it's kind of like Emerald Live and Emerald Essence Emerald.  One's like a good show and one's so stupid and corny. 
[03:10:00]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I hosted both of them.  Yeah, he's right here.  No, I'm talking about Emerald.  You're trying to tell him one of his shows was stupid and corny.  No, I understand that because it really wasn't aimed at both.  Emerald.  There's no D at the end.  I don't care.  Emerald.  He's from Louisiana.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  We like Louisiana.  I'm not going to correct myself.  Emerald.  So, Leo, what do you got for us today?  What can we talk about?  I have stuff in my pocket.  Yeah?  Uh-oh.  What, like little notes or like?  No, like toys.  I used to like a show on tech TV. 
[03:10:30]  It was like the tech of.  Yeah, that was cool.  That was great.  How stuff worked.  But sometimes it would piss me off.  Like I saw the first one I saw was like the tech of a battleship or something.  It was like really cool.  Yeah.  And then like it was like the tech of a football game.  They ran out quickly.  And I realized, I was like, they just ran out of shit to do the tech on.  And they're showing like, you know, the friggin' microphones.  They use the parabolic mics and the cameras.  And I'm like, who cares?  Show me some guns and battleships.  I want to see a battleship, yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Right.  Well, he's got toys in front of them.  You know who has the most tech really in the world and the most advanced tech?  It really is the military, the U.S. military.  Oh, yeah.  I cannot get enough of watching just army footage.  Military footage is great.  You know, a lot of the surveillance in Iraq is done now with Predator drones that are driven  by a guy in Vegas.  So the guy in Vegas sits at a massive computer screen, has the joystick controls.  He's driving an unmanned airplane in Iraq by wire.  And then the people, and then they've got screens all over the world where analysts are 
[03:11:30]  looking at the output of the drone.  And then they've got a chat room going.  And the analysts are chatting with each other about, well, what do you think that is, Joe?  It looks like Osama bin Laden to me, Fred.  And they're tapping.  That's how they're doing this.  I don't think there's any LOLs and smiley faces in that chat.  BRB.  Like things like that.  R-O-T-F-L it that way.  That's a hairy bush, Bob.  So, I mean, really, truly, they have adopted this stuff.  And a lot of it we don't see because it's top secret. 
[03:12:00]  Okay, fire.  You hit that button and it comes up AFK.  The guy's right there, you asshole.  Now, you've got toys in front of you.  I just brought some stuff.  You've probably seen a lot of this stuff.  Have you seen the new Blackberry?  This is actually pretty nice.  The new Blackberry, Opie.  You've got to have the old Blackberry.  Opie is addicted.  He's laughing at me right now.  I brought it for you.  Can I have it for you?  No, no.  Opie is addicted to what they have called Crackberry.  This is the 8700.  It just came out a week ago.  Holy crap.  Isn't that beautiful? 
[03:12:30]  Who has that?  Singular's doing that one.  All right.  Unfortunately, they bought up all the production of it, so it'll only be Singular for a while.  Can I read your email?  Yeah, go ahead.  It's really boring.  It's mostly server warning.  Let me say, the obvious question.  Okay, beautiful screen.  What could that one do that this one can't?  Beautiful color screen, right?  Which one do I have for the listeners at home?  I just got the basic Blackberry.  It probably is a 7200, I don't know what one you have, but it's the older one.  There's a smaller one in that one that cards out the message in a stone with his feet.  Oh, this one stone phone. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Oh, this is nice.  Now, this is a nice one.  He's got the audio vox, or the Sprint.  Yeah, I think it's an audio vox, though.  This has got Microsoft Smartphone on it.  So, this is also a PDA.  And can you do email on this one, too?  Yes, I can.  Oh, look at you, Patrice.  Now, I want to know how mine is.  Yeah, now, uh...  He's showing off.  All right, we'll rate the phone.  This is a whole new segment.  Oh, get my...  I don't have my phone with me.  You'll laugh at my phone.  You'll have a text message.  I know.  Yeah, you got the LG there.  Yeah, what do you think of those phones?  Oh, Samsung.  Yeah, this is okay. 
[03:13:30]  Okay.  It's okay.  It's got the video on demand.  Yeah, yeah.  That's actually more a feature of your carrier.  All the carriers are doing this now.  Verizon does it.  Sprint does it.  Where you can watch TV.  Yeah.  Anthony watches TV.  Fox News has a live feed on their Discovery Channel.  How's the frame rate?  Is it pretty good?  It's not bad for, you know, phone, obviously.  A lot of buffering?  No, no.  That's good.  I've gotten continuous...  I've gotten continuous...  What's happening is...  Sorry, I didn't mean to throw your phone there.  Slid on the newspaper.  Yeah, I tried to slide it gracefully.  If that breaks the phone, then there's a problem. 
[03:14:00]  It broke the phone.  All of the networks are doing...  Yeah, I turned off my phones here.  But all the networks are doing high-speed data networks now.  So, Singular's got Edge.  Verizon's got EVDO.  And these are...  They're almost as fast as your home.  They're like half as fast as your broadband at home.  Which means it's fast enough to put video on it, audio on it.  You can listen to podcasts on it.  Surf the web.  The problem is the screens are so small.  That's why I like these...  Very hard to get a good look at.  Especially something like Fox News, where they divvy up the screen into three different pictures. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, you can't.  There's a crawl on the bottom.  Can't do it.  And you're looking at it through a one-inch screen.  I think you have to produce this stuff for the medium.  In fact, we're starting to do podcasts for the iPod video.  You've seen this.  I don't have to show you this.  I haven't seen an iPod video yet.  All right.  Well, let me put...  What do you want?  Desperate Housewives?  Ugh.  How about you two or something?  Pop something up on there.  What they're going to need to do, though, is consolidate.  Because no one wants to walk around with three or four different electronics items on them. 
[03:15:00]  How do you do that?  How do you get the phone, the iPod, satellite radio?  All that together in one small unit where the screen isn't so big that it doesn't fit in your pocket.  Look at this color on this 8700.  I just want to...  Wow.  Yeah.  That screen is...  You're right.  I mean, that's what people...  And that's one of the reasons that PDAs like the Palm and Pocket PC are kind of dying,  is people don't want to carry a phone PDA and a regular PDA. 
[03:15:30]  So people like Patrice has got...  It's all in there.  Everything's in his phone.  That's it.  Uh-oh.  Somebody turned on a GSM phone.  I can't hear it.  Patrice knows the deal.  This is a communique case coming in on my...  Yeah.  That's a great video.  That's amazing.  Isn't that pretty good quality?  This is a video of Leo on Regis.  That's you on Regis.  Regis and Kelly.  I just happen to have that on there.  What is this?  It's like, oh...  And by the way, I was going to bring this up because I love anytime anyone...  And I've seen you on this.  And it's been some of my favorite Regis moments.  The fact that he is retarded when it comes to computers. 
[03:16:00]  You know, I wonder if it's a little bit of an act.  I have no idea what this is.  You press a button.  I had a computer.  Someone taught me.  I couldn't even turn it off.  Very good.  He gets all angry.  He's good.  He goes, gigabytes, Leo.  What's a gigabyte?  What's a gigabyte?  Every time watch.  He'll do it again this week.  Are you going to be on again with Regis?  Tomorrow.  That's why I'm in town.  Oh, really?  Tomorrow with Regis?  Well, check that out.  Kelly, you know who's hip?  Kelly's very hip to this stuff.  Yeah, she seems like she's going to be into it.  And her husband, Mark Consuelo, comes in every time I'm on. 
[03:16:30]  Well, you're hip because you're a little younger.  And wants to talk tech, you know?  Yeah.  So, you know, last time he was in, he said, well, we're wiring our house.  You know, we want to do wireless throughout the house.  How do you do it?  He's very into this stuff.  Yeah.  You must just be a bitch, though, because everyone must call it friends and stuff.  Like a doctor, right?  I need...  Hey, I'm having a problem.  These goddamn pop-ups, they keep coming up.  You know what I do now?  I say, if you're going to buy a Windows computer, fine.  I'm telling you, buy a Mac.  But if you're going to buy a Windows computer, don't call me.  I don't want to hear from you.  Wow, really?  Because of spyware and viruses. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, but there's a trade-off.  What's the trade-off?  It's called gaming.  It is called gaming.  When you're into gaming, there's nothing like me says for gaming.  You've got the only reason left to buy a PC to play fear gaming.  He's got the system.  I just ordered fear.  How is it?  Awesome.  The most beautiful game ever and terrifying.  That's what I heard, and I love scary shit games.  The first Half-Life that came out back in, like, 95.  Oh, wasn't that scary?  Petrified.  Stuff jumps out at you.  The music, the whole atmosphere it gave, and I've been looking for another game like that. 
[03:17:30]  And I heard Fear is Great.  I saw a spot for it last night on TV, and I instantly ordered it.  Remember I told you about that?  I don't listen to you.  I got a hint for you.  If you go in the room, and there's blood dripping from the ceiling, and you hear a cell phone ringing.  Oh, nice.  Okay?  Yeah.  Look for the cell phone.  Really?  All right.  And I'll give you a hint.  It's related to the blood.  Really?  Yeah.  Just a hint.  Just a little hint.  Does that sound scary, or what?  That's pretty cool.  You go in a room, you go in a room, you see blood dripping from the ceiling, and you hear a phone ringing, 
[03:18:00]  and you can't figure out where it's coming from.  You know what game blew it?  That is crazy shit.  Isn't it great?  And I love it.  Did you play, I'm going old school here, but I think this particular game really blew it.  Silence Hill?  The first Silence Hill?  Never even heard of it.  They were on to something big time.  That's a great game.  And then the whole franchise fell apart.  I never heard of it.  And with the gaming getting better, and the graphics and stuff, they could have done some unbelievable things.  They have a locker room scene that made me jump out of my chair.  With the cat jumping out of the locker?  Yeah, I think it was a dead body falls out of the locker as you're in this creepy, creepy locker room. 
[03:18:30]  Those games are the best.  When you actually jump because something came out of you, you're so immersed in the game.  There are games that aren't immersive that you could sit there and things are happening, but it hasn't pulled you into the game.  But you're right, Anthony.  That's why PCs survive right now.  Yeah.  But that's not happy for Microsoft.  That doesn't make Microsoft happy.  No, they're looking for people in every office to just have banks.  I own both.  I have a Mac for media, for video editing, sound editing. 
[03:19:00]  It's the best.  PCs are fine in the office because you've got an IT guy, and you're being protected.  I bet you it probably pisses you off sometimes you try to use the computer here, and you can't do stuff that you'd like to do because the IT guys are protecting you.  Yeah, constantly changing passwords and stuff.  We need to hire a guy for our home computers.  I'm crazy, though.  That's right.  I've gotten to the point where I'm nuts at home with my computer.  Every day, I'm scanning for shit.  I make sure I keep up on it. 
[03:19:30]  You have to be.  Because if you let it go a while, then there's so much stuff on there that it's very hard to track down any Trojans.  You've got to have just one computer for all the crap.  The virus computer.  That doesn't work either, though.  The virus computer.  What, you throw it away when it gets filled up with viruses?  The damn computer's coughing at you.  It's had it.  Sneezing.  It's sneezing.  How do you completely remove stuff from your hard drive?  Oh, look at that problem.  You've got something on there you don't want to do. 
[03:20:00]  See, isn't that great, Leo?  And then he'll say, no, I'm just wondering.  Jimmy does the same thing.  There are overwrite programs out there.  Yeah, you want a shredding program.  This is a very good one.  Yeah, shredding program.  Darren's, if you want, just do a Google search for Darren's Boot Nuke.  Because what it does is it nukes your hard drive on boot.  Now, this is if you want to erase everything or just certain things.  I'm just curious, you're not a, you know.  People send me things.  I know what Patrice wants.  Here's what Patrice wants.  It's a program called TrueCrypt.  And it'll take a part of your hard drive and make it an invisible hard drive. 
[03:20:30]  And the key to it is it has something called plausible deniability.  So when the feds say, do you have any other data on here?  You can plausibly say, no.  Because it doesn't look like a drive or anything.  It looks like random data on your drive.  Ah.  Plausible deniability.  That's what you want.  Important phrase.  And what is the best way to destroy a hard drive after you've pulled it out of your computer  and ditched the record?  You want to know what the British government does?  What?  So they take the hard drive out.  They erase it with a big magnet. 
[03:21:00]  They take a drill.  They drill a hole through the platters.  And then sometimes, if it's really sensitive stuff, they'll grind it up.  And then they don't even take the shavings and throw them out.  They put them in a safe and lock it up.  That's a little paranoid.  What are you going to do?  Piece them together with tweezers?  Well, remember, there's magnetic fields on there.  And I guess they're thinking somehow you could throw it all back together.  I don't think you need to do that, Patrice.  Not for that.  A little scrambling is probably enough.  Hey, the obvious question.  The holidays are here. 
[03:21:30]  What should people be buying?  They're looking for one cool gadget.  I think this is a good year to buy a good TV, a big screen TV.  HD stuff is finally out there.  There's enough stuff to watch on HBO.  And the prices have gone down.  The prices are amazing.  I'm a fan of the LCDs myself, like the Sharp Outpost.  A lot of people say LCD.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not going to get as big a screen.  They're more expensive per square inch.  But I think you get a...  Plasma worries me.  I don't think plasma is going to live very long.  You know, if you've looked at a plasma screen that's five years old, it's dimmer.  What happens is the gas leaks out of those cells. 
[03:22:00]  And now the manufacturers are saying, oh, no, we fixed that problem.  But how are you going to know five years from now, right?  I don't like LCD.  And I don't know how much better they've gotten over the past couple of years.  But the last time I really did some research on monitors for my computer, because I like a nice big monitor to play games on.  And I have a CRT monitor, and I still do.  It's huge.  The back of it goes out, you know, three feet.  But I don't like the frame rate on LCDs.  It just doesn't...  For gaming, you're getting that ghosting when you move by really quickly. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  They call that screen latency, pixel latency.  And they've actually proved it quite a bit.  Because the LCD can't change as quickly as CRT pixel can change on a regular tube.  They're down to nine milliseconds now on the faster screens.  And that does make a difference.  And your TVs will be pretty quick.  But you're right.  If you're going to watch an action movie on an LCD screen, you might...  It never bothers me, but you might say, oh, there's a little ghosting.  Yeah.  The other kind that's a real...  You know, you really want big, lots of real estate. 
[03:23:00]  I think, bang for your buck, the DLP projections are just great.  Yeah.  They're bigger physically.  But, you know, like...  Because, you know, a lot of times your wife wants a thin screen.  Right, right.  So you can pretend you don't have a TV.  But the...  I don't know why they do that.  The DLP is amazing.  The DLP is great.  I was just looking at one yesterday.  And that's fully digital.  Yeah.  It was in the Time Warner building, and two guys were on the couch just playing John Madden  on that thing.  Oh, it's amazing.  Holy...  Well, especially if you get an Xbox 360, because it's got built-in component for HD.  Yeah.  If you get the high-end one, and that looks incredible. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  What about the...  I was walking by Radio Shack yesterday, and have the actual projector that businessmen point  the laser beam?  Yeah.  You can actually...  All of those things, you can actually...  They're very good.  In fact, they make DLP projectors.  So the one...  There's rear projection, which is all-in-one.  It's very good, Patrice, if you're setting up a meeting.  No, no.  You can go 60 inches.  Yeah.  Do your PowerPoint presentation on the wall with your...  No, I'm just saying, Mr. Effing Gamer.  You can go 80 inches, man.  And, like, you can sit there and project onto the wall at 80 inches. 
[03:24:00]  Patrice is right.  You're only drawing back with those...  I have plenty of inches.  Thank you.  I know a guy that has one of those that is working and going on message boards and stuff  about what you do to prepare the wall to be the screen.  They've done everything from painting mirrors to getting silver paint and putting it on the  wall.  You buy a screen, I'm crying out loud.  Yeah.  You buy a screen.  You pull it down.  The only issue with those is you've got to darken the room because it's like a movie  theater.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, it's not great for watching a football game with the guys because you have 
[03:24:30]  to draw the blinds.  High def is great for football games.  High def is so nice.  You get a nice high def in it.  The only problem I have...  I have a high def TV.  I love it.  But the cable system...  You watch a movie, you're still getting pixelation, especially when you realize they're having  a problem compressing all these movies.  So when it goes from light to dark or it's a very dark scene or a lot of the action changes,  you're seeing squares of the picture changing and it blows the shit out of the fact that 
[03:25:00]  you spend so much on television, you're getting cable coming in here and paying all kinds of  money and you're not getting the best picture.  Yeah.  That's kind of a...  Unfortunately, it's a dirty little secret right now of HD is that even, for instance,  ESPN HD, a lot of times they're up-sampling.  They're improving the resolution of really basically boring old SD.  Uh-huh.  And so it looks crappy.  So, you know, that is an issue.  One of the things that's going to change is you're going to get HD DVD players by the 
[03:25:30]  end of this year, maybe early next year, and that's kind of...  Wow.  Oh, baby.  That's great.  Yeah.  It looks so nice.  A whole new game.  But, but, see, this is what's making me sick about this whole technological...  Technological?  This bullshit.  Not your bullshit.  That's okay.  I'll just take my stuff.  But I'm not saying...  I'm saying, you know...  No, I know what you're talking about.  It's like, okay...  It's expensive.  I have a goddamn tube TV in my house right now, the one with the 75, the back.  It's heavy.  It's not flat.  Right.  And...  Oh, my TV still goes back four feet. 
[03:26:00]  I can't push my TV all the way against the wall, okay?  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  So, I'm not into this, what you guys are talking about, until you start talking about it.  It's like, oh, shit.  I got to get me an HD now, man.  That's right.  No, that's really true.  I ain't shit.  But...  Right.  It's like a scam or something.  Yeah, you're right.  You can't keep up with this stuff.  I agree with you.  I understand completely.  HD, right now, though, is getting to the point now where you just got to have it.  Yeah, everything for me, HD.  I watched when, you know, I'm watching the Yankees or something during, well, not the World 
[03:26:30]  Series, but the playoffs.  It's just, it's part of your cable.  It's not that.  It's like four or five bucks more.  You got to pay for it.  Four or five bucks, and it's worth it.  You put that game on Fox, and then you go to Fox HD and watch the same game, you're getting  it in widescreen, so you're getting more of the field.  That's true.  And the picture itself is so crisp, it makes a difference.  It's not just bullshit like, I can't barely tell the difference.  Right, right.  You are seeing a difference on it.  And then if you get the surround sound, the guy's selling beers behind you. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Which is wild.  Surround sound.  Now you're getting the sound.  Yeah, get your beer.  What's the best surround sound system going on right now?  You know, actually, it's...  How's the Bose 321?  How is that?  That's good.  I think you pay more for Bose than you ought to.  Bose, yeah.  You're paying for the brand name.  There's a lot of good 3D, I mean, 5.1 sound systems.  And they're not as bulky as they used to be.  No.  You used to have to put, I mean, a giant subwoofer, and then the satellite speakers, which were  very big and wired and stuff.  Now you get wireless satellite speakers that are pretty small. 
[03:27:30]  You go up on maybe a little stand if you don't put them on the wall, and a lot easier set up.  Look for something called Home Theater in a Box, H-T-I-B.  It's a DVD player and the sound and an amplifier, the whole thing in one kit.  It's very easy, and a lot of good companies make them.  Yeah.  And, you know, Bose is good.  Bose does sound good, but I think you pay it like 50% more just because it's Bose.  You're probably going to be able to get the same quality item for the sound name.  Two speakers, but the Bose 321, two speakers and a subwoofer. 
[03:28:00]  Sounds good.  And everything plugs in the back.  There's no wires.  There's no goofy shit you got to do to make it look good.  That's Home Theater in a Box, and sometimes it's 5-1 instead of just 3-1.  You know, I think Cambridge Soundworks makes good ones for a very reasonable price.  There's a lot of good ones out there.  Cambridge Soundworks in a box.  Hey, moving on to something else.  You know, the Xbox 360 came out.  Yeah.  I'm hearing, first of all, a lot of people are returning them because there's some kind of glitch.  An overheating problem, and some are crashing.  And crashing, that's the one I heard on the news recently.  There's a lawsuit against Microsoft.  Now, here's their problem.  This is a console that is trying to act like a computer. 
[03:28:30]  Now, the good part of it is you're going to get some dynamite graphics.  You're going to be able to play games that are comparable to a lot of the PC games out there.  But the bad side is you're now going to get games that we've had to deal with on PC that aren't done yet, that have bugs.  And you've got a computer.  Just bring it back.  If it doesn't work, you take it back to the retailer like any other appliance, and you say,  It's broken.  Give me one that works.  That's all.  And Microsoft's fixing them. 
[03:29:00]  It's an early production glitch.  I don't think it's a long-term problem.  I know what you're saying.  I hear a problem, though, that the games now are crashing.  Where normally console games would come out done.  It's a done deal.  You don't have to worry about patches and upgrades because they never had the capacity to really patch a console game.  It might be.  Now, they're starting to put games out early because now you've got the capacity to plug this thing in  and download patches for your games now.  It's been a real problem in the PC gaming industry where companies really don't release final versions.  They release an early pre-release.  There have been games that have come out that work beautifully, and I love it. 
[03:29:30]  You pop it in.  Not a problem beginning to end.  There have been some I've popped in and thrown against the wall after ten minutes of crashing.  The patch of the week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And no patch available yet.  Right.  You just bought the game.  Excuse me.  How about you put it out in a few weeks when it's done?  You install World of Warcraft now.  You're going to spend two hours downloading patches before you can play the game.  Patches.  Or they'll put out a game like EverQuest comes out.  A lot of the upgrades and expansions come out. 
[03:30:00]  And then you wind up having to buy the gold edition, which is the upgraded version, the platinum edition.  You're buying the same game three or four times over just so you don't have to sit there  and spend ten hours downloading all the content that they've upgraded.  They're making money off the same goddamn games.  They learned that from the music industry.  Colby, can I unload a conspiracy theory question?  Yes.  Black Man has a lot of conspiracy theories. 
[03:30:30]  We learned this on this program.  Here's what I hear about the gaming industries.  First of all, I heard, this is the first part of this.  I heard Xbox, the original Xbox, never lived up to the full potential of its, what do they call it?  The hype?  The hardware.  Yeah, the power of it.  Yeah, the chip.  With the amount, a million mega of this and that.  I heard it never lived up to, like, why it's like, oh, I was really better than PS2, but  it never really was because I heard PS2 because it has, it's so, so many more consoles used 
[03:31:00]  to tell people to don't make, their software companies don't make games better than our  games for Xbox.  Even though you can, we need you to make the same shitty games that you make for Xbox that  you make for us.  Even though we know Xbox, you can make a better game, but if you want us to continue to sell  your game on our console, since our console has 10 million sold and Xbox only has 1 million  sold, you better not make better stuff.  And Xbox could make the games that they make now for 360 on the regular Xbox. 
[03:31:30]  They don't have to have a 360.  Really?  Yes.  Both the PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, both haven't been pushed to their capacity.  I'd agree with that.  Not to their limit.  They can have a 360 graphics on the regular Xbox.  Well, speaking of which, what about the PS3?  That's going to be coming out soon.  Yeah, I mean...  What are you hearing?  Well, it's got, all the specs look great, but...  Is it going to be better than the Xbox in there?  Could be.  The Xbox 360?  You've got to understand, both of these have much more power than your home computer.  I mean, the Xbox 360 has three 3.2 gigahertz chips in it.  I mean, this thing is super fast. 
[03:32:00]  And the PS2 has this untried chip called the Cell Chip that is, on paper, you know, as  eight processors.  Very impressive.  But, you know, the problem is we haven't seen games played on it.  At the gaming expo a few months ago, the games they were showing were running off of a Mac.  And they would just pipe them into...  It looks like it was coming off the PS3.  Talk about a conspiracy.  See, yeah.  See, I'm not into that.  When Xbox first came out, they were pushing it that it was better than a PC, as far as  gaming goes, better graphically. 
[03:32:30]  But then you're hooking it up to a television.  Right.  So you're not getting the resolution.  Put it on an HD monitor.  Right.  Put it on...  But a lot of people weren't.  A lot of people aren't.  Right.  So they're trying to push that.  I like the fact that when new video cards come out, I can pop those in my PC and keep  the best possible graphics card in my PC and play games and have them look better.  Yeah, but your video card costs as much as a console.  I'm so fucking rich that it doesn't even matter to me. 
[03:33:00]  There's your conspiracy theory.  Wow.  Where'd that come from?  I just like being able to toy around and upgrade my computer.  He likes to do all that geeky stuff.  I don't even have a clue.  I'm constantly...  Every six months, my computer is open and a new graphics card is going in.  As much memory as possible is in there.  And I'm completely happy with the graphics of these games and the speed, the frame rate  I'm getting.  He's putting $250 graphics cards in there.  He's putting significant money into this thing. 
[03:33:30]  That's the advantage of something like an Xbox or a 360.  But it's going to look better than it does off of the goddamn 360.  It might.  It might.  It will.  Believe it or not, the reason the Xbox hasn't lived up to its potential is that people  haven't written games to take advantage of it.  That's what you have to wait for is the developers.  A lot of people are saying the same thing about PC, though.  That they were pumping out machines that were so over the games that were out there.  Hardware usually does lead software.  That's pretty common.  But the software eventually gets to the point where people start bitching on the message  voice. 
[03:34:00]  I can't even run this shit.  What the fuck?  It'll never catch up with you.  And see, that's the thing.  You're always upgrading ahead of the software.  That's right, my friend.  What else we got going on in the tech world?  Actually, I need a cell phone.  And I don't want all the fancy crap.  I just want a good...  You don't like the BlackBerry phone?  I just got to...  I want to get another one.  I heard the phone feature stinks on the one he has.  You know, a good time to buy a Razer right now.  The Razer price is around 80 bucks.  But I'm hearing it's tough to hear on those things.  What are you, deef?  A little bit from this radio show. 
[03:34:30]  I'm a mic deef.  No, I've heard that as a complaint, though.  This one's really loud.  This is the new Sony Ericsson.  It's kind of a flip phone.  What do you think of the Nokia flip phone?  Those are...  Oh, if you want a good camera, the 90, the N90.  I don't need a new...  You just want a regular phone.  I need just a nice, solid, good phone.  Yeah, because this is like from playing music.  This has the loudest speaker phone I've ever heard.  Really?  Yeah, I don't want to turn...  Well, I can turn it on.  I don't need all those bells and whistles yet.  I just want a good, solid phone.  I think Sanyo makes very good phones.  Samsung...  Who's your carrier, really?  The thing is you've got to... 
[03:35:00]  Singular?  Yes, you've got to start with...  Singular actually offers, I think, the best phones.  Yeah.  They're a good carrier because they tend to get the latest, greatest phones.  They were the first to have the Razer.  They were the first to have this new BlackBerry.  So I would just go on the website and look,  and what you want is a phone with not the bells and whistles.  You'll get better audio and better battery life, more importantly.  I mean, most of these phones with the cameras and the MP3 players and stuff,  you're lucky you can get through a day.  And Opie wants...  You need a flip-type phone.  Don't get ones with exposed speeds. 
[03:35:30]  Because I don't want to hear you, you call me up,  and all I hear is you singing Too Shy Shy on the way home  because you didn't realize you hit me on speed dial.  That's the best.  How many of those calls do you get?  I love that.  I've gotten in some big trouble with my wife.  Oh, really?  You've got to be very careful what you do.  You're just waiting going,  Oh, my God, they're going to talk about me.  And you can't hang up.  You can't hang up.  I don't know if I should hang up or listen to this.  If they start talking about me, I'm going to feel really bad.  I listen to my...  Hide the keys.  My sister doesn't even know this, and she listens to the show.  I listened to her once in her, I don't know, minivan, whatever, 
[03:36:00]  going to an appointment, just singing along to the...  Yeah, you hear the car in this song.  You hear the blinker going, and they start talking.  And then she turns on the music.  I shouldn't be listening to this, but I can't.  Oh, it was great.  There's actually a cell phone out.  I think it's Nokia's selling it.  It's a spy phone.  The whole idea of the phone is that you can dial...  You give it to your wife, right?  Here, honey, a new phone for Christmas.  And you can dial into it without it ringing, without it making any noise.  It can look like it's a sleeper off, and you can listen. 
[03:36:30]  And the whole...  Now, it's 800 bucks.  It's just a regular Nokia phone.  There's no reason it should be that expensive, except for this one feature.  But they'll get it, because there'll be a lot of people who want to say,  Here, honey, new phone for Christmas.  So she's on the phone.  You dial up a number.  Where you can now listen in on the conversation, or you can hear everything that's going on around her at any given moment.  It's basically a microphone.  It's a bug.  Now, they also...  The press release even suggests...  Can you imagine?  This is even great.  The press release suggests that you go to business meetings.  You go to the bathroom.  You leave the phone on the table. 
[03:37:00]  Wow, that's a good one.  And you listen to them negotiate your price.  They don't know.  They fine tomorrow.  Yeah, but who has the balls to leave their phone behind and hear what people have to say?  White people don't speak.  You've got to have a thick skin for that.  You've got to have a thick skin.  It's not a big thing in the black community, because we're like,  Hold on, I'm going to go back in the middle of McDonald's.  I just want to make sure you ain't sitting in my burger.  But white people are leaving around.  I don't hold Jim.  I'm going to fucking...  I'm going to take Orbe right back here. 
[03:37:30]  Don't move my phone from right at this position.  Never has those TPS reports in on time.  Any other tech stuff to get excited about?  Let's see.  We covered...  You want to talk about MP3 players?  I mean, the iPod.  We talked about the video.  I think the Nano is beautiful.  You like the video iPod?  You like the Nano, right?  Wow.  You've talked about that.  Have you ever not seen this?  Not seen one live, no.  This is a beautiful device.  Look at how tiny that is.  What's going to be good that I can actually buy?  Give me like a secret fun thing other than this horse shit. 
[03:38:00]  The iPod Nano.  That's what you need.  This is not a horse shit.  That's $149.  It's $149.  It's not horse shit because it's not good.  It's horse shit because it's like, let me go get one.  I'm going to sleep in front of goddamn whatever, King, and wait to buy one.  No, these are easy to get.  You can walk into the store and get these.  What's good and sneaky?  Something really sneaky I can get this year that's good.  That's going to be fun.  Something fun, sneaky, and really good.  Sneaky technology.  They have now a little handset that has all of the old Intellivision games on it.  I think you'd be right for your big screen TV in the back. 
[03:38:30]  Stick it in there.  Oh, yeah.  I got that.  And you play like games where the guys go boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Isn't it amazing?  But those can be fun.  Not at all.  There's four gigs in this thing?  Four gigs, yeah.  And the Nano iPod.  It's like the size of a chewing stick.  Well, you think back to hard drives.  Chewing gum.  Chewing gum.  What's a good free download sign?  Of your computer years ago.  Amazing, right?  Free downloads?  That would be, I could tell you, but it'd be wrong.  Oh, it's illegal.  Oh, it's illegal.  Oh, sorry.  Where do I get my movies for free?  Yeah, that's all I need to know. 
[03:39:00]  I could tell you, but the recording industry would be on your door.  I'm sick of going to the Koreans downtown, man.  I want to do it at home.  This is why Sony put that stuff on there.  Exactly.  It's for Opie.  It's for him.  Yeah, they are pissed off about pirating.  Lindsey's brother picked up 40-year-old Virgin last time he was in town.  Yeah.  And one of the bootlegs from one of these Korean sidewalk joints.  How was it?  Well, it's the camera in the movie theater.  The guy gets up to go get popcorn. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, promotional ones now.  You hear people eating, and you hear the cameras all shaky.  Well, the trick is going to be when they finally get to that point where they digitally deliver the movies to the theaters.  Because that's going to be when you can rip off the movie in its digital form and burn it.  I have a tough time going to the movie theater because it's like, they are so behind the times.  They really are, though, with the screen and stuff.  You're like, I've got a better picture.  I've got a better picture at home, and I don't have anything that special. 
[03:40:00]  Lucas is working on that.  But when are they going to upgrade all the movie theaters?  They are slowly.  I don't know what it's like in the city.  I've heard it's so expensive, and that's the only reason they haven't gone there yet.  Lucas is working on digital delivery right from him filming it digitally to it being delivered to the theaters digitally and shown digitally where it's on the screen.  Anyone else with me, though?  You go to a movie, and it's like, I've got better shit at home.  You've got to go to the suburbs.  I've got better theater shows.  You're not there for the vision.  You're there for the company to, you know.  That's bullshit.  I hate it.  Cell phones ringing. 
[03:40:30]  A lot of that.  The locusts eating their popcorn.  Patrice sitting in front of me on his cell phone with 20 of his friends.  This shit's funny, nigga.  Exactly.  But I wish it would be digitally delivered, though.  This old school film shit sucks.  I never hear that.  All that Tom Cruise.  Run, motherfucker.  That's what I heard.  Listen, we've got no show.  I had to flee Mission Impossible.  Patrice O'Neill, thanks for sitting in.  Patrice will be here tomorrow and Friday, hopefully.  Absolutely. 
[03:41:00]  We've got a little phone call with Eric Logan we've got to get to.  And, Leo, what are we promoting?  Leo, thank you, man.  ThisWeekInTech.com.  ThisWeekInTech.com.  That's all you need to know.  And you'll be on Regis tomorrow.  Yeah.  I don't want to promote that.  That's it.  I want to watch that, though.  That's always funny when you're trying to teach him something.  Gigabytes.  What's a gigabyte?  Gigabyte.  I don't know.  We'll play some of the audio on our show after your appearance, because it'll be fun.  It'll be fun fodder for this program.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  Very informative.  Thanks for inviting me.  This is fun.  No problem.  And there's the countdown.  We will, I hope, see you tomorrow. 
[03:41:30]  If we don't, your mom's box.  This should be digital.  It's over.  Everybody go home.  This is Steve B. Femini Show. </pre>
