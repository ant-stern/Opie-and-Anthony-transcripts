<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion centered around photographs of a woman who had undergone a face transplant following a shotgun blast inflicted by her husband.  The hosts and callers made numerous crude and humorous comparisons of her post-operative appearance to various cartoon and fictional characters, including Sigmund from "Sigmund and the Sea Monsters," characters from "American Dad," "South Park," "Ghostbusters," and "Fraggle Rock," as well as food items.  A clip of the woman at a press conference was played, prompting further commentary and comparisons.  This segment involved numerous listener calls contributing to the ongoing, often offensive, descriptions.

The conversation then veered sharply to a graphic discussion of a Brie Olsen cyber skin sex toy, with the hosts providing detailed and sexually explicit descriptions and jokes.  This was followed by brief mentions of Brett Favre's potential NFL return, Willie Mays' birthday, the anniversary of Elton John's "Rocket Man," and upcoming appearances by Brian Regan, Chris Cornell (who had been a guest on the show the previous day), and Colin Quinn.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a picture deemed too offensive to tweet, possibly showing genitalia. This led to a discussion of Kiefer Sutherland's alleged drunken altercation with a fashion designer, involving headbutting and indecent exposure.  Speculation about his relationship with Brooke Shields followed.  This segued into a discussion of James Gandolfini's encounter with paparazzi at the Waverly Inn, prompting a debate about the culpability of celebrities versus paparazzi, extending to similar conflicts in Los Angeles.

A significant portion was devoted to Popeye's fried chicken, comparing its quality to KFC and Boston Market, and its perceived geographical distribution.  Listener calls, including one from "Trucker Dan" about his weight gain from Popeye's and "Lady Trucker" mentioning Oprah's KFC endorsement, contributed to this discussion.  A listener also mentioned a program offering money for reporting drug dealers via text message in Mastic, Long Island.  The discussion of the face-transplanted woman returned, with Patrice O’Neal as a guest contributing to the often outrageous commentary.  The segment concluded with the hosts contemplating the nature of reality, wealth, and the possibility of conspiracies surrounding events like the swine flu.

The next segment opened with a discussion about the perceived worthlessness of money and inflation, escalating into a humorous scenario involving bartering appliances for bread.  This transitioned into a conspiracy theory about aspartame, linking Donald Rumsfeld's tenure at Searle to its approval, claiming it breaks down into formaldehyde when heated and linking it to Gulf War Syndrome.  Listeners called in with varied opinions and personal anecdotes.  The discussion broadened to other potentially harmful substances like saccharin and chemicals in Mountain Dew.  Tangents included humorous comments about a woman resembling Jabba the Hutt, a toe-grafted-to-hand news story, and sensational headlines. A caller claimed aspartame cessation reversed his muscular dystrophy. Chris Cornell’s previous day studio visit and dislike for Trent Reznor were mentioned.  The hosts then reviewed upcoming movies, including *Star Trek*, *Angels & Demons*, and *Terminator Salvation*.  A detailed review of *Wolverine* by intern David, featuring a staged argument between Sam and Danny about Wolverine's exoskeleton resolved by a call to "Big Kev," followed by a return to David’s review including a discussion of male nudity in the film, and a ranking of superhero movies concluded this segment.


The following segment focused on *X-Men Origins: Wolverine*, specifically Hugh Jackman's physique and crude speculation about Wolverine's penis size.  This led to a discussion of intern David's impending departure, his refusal to work for free, and a lengthy in-studio conversation with comedian Greg Giraldo, alongside Patrice O'Neal and Jay Moore (who called in).  Giraldo discussed his struggles with substance abuse and relapses, including a bizarre anecdote about hallucinating robots.  The conversation covered the challenges of sobriety in the comedic profession, mentioning other comedians, and detailing Giraldo's past success and relapse triggers. A listener also called in to share their struggles with addiction.


The final segment featured a phone call from Josh, detailing his own struggles with substance abuse and relapse, expressing feelings of self-centeredness and depression, and his justifications for continued drug use.  This was followed by more discussion with Greg Giraldo about his substance abuse and coping mechanisms, including his daily beer consumption and an upcoming comedy special.  The conversation touched upon self-destructive tendencies, the difficulties of sobriety, and rationalizations for substance use.  The discussion also revisited the "Face Lady" or "Pelican Lady," included further off-color jokes and comments about women, and a highly inappropriate discussion about the age at which people find others attractive.  The mention of Kevin Kennedy being nearby concluded before a commercial break for ProFlowers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Hello? Hello? Hello?  I'm trying to find a clip for the story of the day, but I don't have it in front of me. 
[00:00:30]  The story of the day combined with the picture of the day.  I want to set up the story of the day with a clip.  Yes.  Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it was on the old machine, and it's not on the new machine.  The old machine.  The old machine.  It was just a scream. A Homer scream.  Of course. 
[00:01:00]  Homer just screaming.  Because by now, most people have seen the first picture.  Oh, God.  I just sent the picture out on Twitter so everyone can puke this morning.  The first face transplant picture.  This is horrific.  Yeah.  We're building monsters.  Monster!  Yeah.  This is horrific.  And I was telling Anthony, probably what the deal is with this picture, 
[00:01:30]  the guy who did the first face transplant  probably is a wonderful surgeon.  Probably one of the best in the world.  It would have to be.  But he probably was awful in art.  A horrible artist.  And that's the problem that these surgeons face.  Really good surgeons, bad at art.  I mean, they really piled on the flesh. 
[00:02:00]  How do you describe it?  She's got jowls.  Teasing E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  She's got these big hanging jowls.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the donor face was off a real big fat woman.  And they didn't know how to thin that face down before they sewed it on.  She looks like the lady in Total Recall.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Yes. 
[00:02:30]  I think the picture on the left.  Twist her ears and look like Arnold.  You'd be better off.  The picture on the left where she has only, like, she still has a ways to go.  Yeah.  I guess she still doesn't have a nose with the picture on the left.  The lips aren't really defined yet.  She looks like a Star Wars character.  Yeah, I would rather walk around like that than the final product.  Yeah.  She was all right, too.  I mean, she was a pretty cute, you know, middle-aged woman.  And what happened?  She got a shotgun blast to the face? 
[00:03:00]  Well, a little shotgun to the face might do that to you.  I mean, everyone's checking out the pictures today.  There's a picture on Newsday where they have a CAT scan of her face after she got the shotgun blast.  Hold on a minute.  What?  What, Iraq?  Go ahead.  What?  Oh, my God.  No, you were pointing.  Go ahead.  What?  Oh, God.  What, Iraq?  No, it was something Danny was looking up.  The news actually had her photos labeled as monster face.  And there's, like, two different versions of it.  And then there's I'm no monster. 
[00:03:30]  She wasn't cute, Iraq.  Poor Eric.  That was worth stopping the entire show for.  Of course, we did.  Thank you.  The picture on Newsday, though, they have a CAT scan of her bone structure after she took  the shotgun blast to the face.  Yeah.  And her bones are just shattered below the eyeballs.  I guess that's the problem is they had to rebuild all that shit underneath.  Like, you can't rebuild the house without the foundation. 
[00:04:00]  And that's, like, what they did.  And the top of her head is very tiny and dainty and ladylike.  And then from right at the side of her head where your eyes are, down to the mouth, is  this giant fat head.  I'm trying to.  Do you walk around?  What's worse?  I mean, obviously, I guess the no nose is worse. 
[00:04:30]  And the permanent meh face.  Meh.  Just go like this.  Meh.  Turn the corny's mouth down.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Oh, also, cut your nose off.  She was spiting her face.  If you had a face transplant, would you ever look into the mirror again?  Oh, my God.  For real.  Only from the bridge of your nose up.  I would never look in the mirror.  Because I would be like, oh, my God, who is this person? 
[00:05:00]  That's not me.  She looks nothing like she used to.  She should have committed crimes beforehand.  She'd get away with it.  What'd she look like?  Not that.  Nope.  Put her in a lineup.  It ain't her.  Do we have a prize for the person that comes up with the best description of face transplant  lady?  Oh.  Do we have any prizes in our prize closet?  Probably not.  We should maybe get a prize closet.  We haven't had a prize closet in, what, five or six years?  Her glasses are resting on her fake cheeks.  Is it really bad to laugh? 
[00:05:30]  Doesn't it shrink, though?  Like, the lady in France had one, and her face kind of shrunk after a while.  Did it?  Yeah.  I think you adjust to it.  I think the reason why the face was shrinking was because it was rotting off her face.  Do we have this story?  Off her head.  Was it a boyfriend that fucking got a little angry?  His husband got a little pissed off about what?  Dinner burnt.  He shot her in the face, and then he shot himself.  And I think he's alive.  What a terrible shot.  He's alive, too?  He only got seven years for it.  Wow. 
[00:06:00]  Let's say hi to Maria on Long Island.  What does he look like?  I don't know.  Probably not as bad, because we don't have any pictures of him.  She was cute back before she was shot.  Yeah.  Maria!  Good morning.  Good morning.  How are ya?  We're good.  How are ya?  How are ya?  First of all, last night watching the news, my husband looked at me because I busted out  laughing and said, what happened to you?  And the only thing I can confess is you guys.  But I personally thought she looked like Sigmund from Sigmund and the Sea Monsters. 
[00:06:30]  Sigmund, the little sea monster.  And this is before surgery, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  She looks...  That's pretty good.  Thank you, boys.  Have a great day.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what you're supposed to do with this story.  I mean, I see something like that.  I just...  I have to just kind of laugh.  What does he look like?  Culp's husband, Thomas, shot her in 2004, turned the gun on himself.  He went to prison for seven years.  His wife was left clinging to life.  Blast shattered her nose, cheeks, the roof of her mouth, and an eye. 
[00:07:00]  Right in the middle of the face.  Hundreds of fragments of shotgun pellet and bone splinters were embedded in her face.  She needed a tube into her windpipe to breathe.  Only her upper eyelids, forehead, lower lip, and chin were left.  She must have looked...  Before they sewed this shut...  As you can see where, before this transplant surgery, it's from cheek to cheek.  They sewed her shut.  But that was just laid open like a big hole in her face. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did she live through that?  Wow.  I don't know.  So did he, though.  Maybe it was a...  Yeah, what did he do?  Like, oh, my toe.  Yeah, how do you live through that is right.  Well, I mean, none of that...  None of the shotgun blast went into her brain, obviously.  It was all below her eyes.  So I guess that's just safe area.  It's going to make a mess, but you're going to survive that.  Yeah.  Oh, here I am five years later.  He did what he said.  I got my nose, Culp said, laughing of her doctor, I guess. 
[00:08:00]  Laughing.  Bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff.  Once while shopping, she heard a little kid say,  You said you were no real...  Oh, you said there were no real monsters, Mommy.  And there's one right there.  Kids are little fucking pricks, aren't they?  Well, they're honest.  She said, I'm not a monster.  I'm a person who was shot and pulled out her driver's license to show the child what she  used to look like.  I'd have gone, and scare the shit out of the little fucker. 
[00:08:30]  Well, now that she's had the face transplant, maybe she should get the facelift.  Yeah, she could use a facelift.  Now she could use a nice facelift.  And that's dead person face right there.  Is it really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She got dead person face, nerves, skin, muscle, bone, blood vessels.  Someone is looking at this going, I know her.  I thought she was dead.  This whole fat face. 
[00:09:00]  Let's say hi to John in Chicago.  John?  Oh, mountain head.  I remember her.  Oh, shit.  Or she's kissing.  Or she's kissing.  Or she's kissing.  Oh, that's horrid.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, I was watching that news conference yesterday.  We were halfway through it before I realized they weren't interviewing Jay Leno's sister.  Oh, wow.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:09:30]  This is her talking, by the way.  You want to hear her talk?  Yeah, please.  Well, I guess I'm the one you came to see today.  Oh, uncomfortable laughter.  My name's Connie, and while I know what you focus on me,  I think it's more important that you focus on the family that made it  so I could have this Christmas present, I guess I should say, 
[00:10:00]  and all the great doctors with their intelligence to be able to give us  a doctor's seminar for all her years of experience.  And all my great nurses, I mean, they're like, they're my family.  You know, Pat here, she's my motivator.  She's going to help me to exercise and eat my greens and drink my water.  Oh, my God. Yes. 
[00:10:30]  We're finding pictures of what she looks like.  And what is that, American Dad?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is Stan Smith from American Dad.  Stan Smith.  Good old Stan Smith.  From American Dad.  She looks just like him.  Oh, God.  She still has her nice Southern Belle voice, though.  Anyone notice that?  It's a little muffled, but she still has that Southern Belle thing happening.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John?  Hey, you know who I think she looks like?  Speaking of cartoons, the South Park episode when the Ass Face family  shows up looking for Ben Affleck. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, great.  Very good.  It's all cartoons that she looks like.  Yeah, that's not a good sign.  No people.  She just looks like a homely lady.  I guess that's not bad compared to laying in the hospital with a hole in your face.  I reckon.  I would assume that the swelling is going to continue to go down or something,  because there's no way they would just put her back on the street like this.  America's back on the street.  She's not ready.  She's not street legal.  No, not yet.  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe there's like drains or something that have to drain fluid out of her face or something. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I like Danny pulls up a webpage and there's just some chick bent over with her asshole showing.  Dude, no matter what you search for, you're going to get at least three or four results.  Yeah, at least three or four things are going to be just porno.  Let's say hi to Bob in Boston.  Bob.  Hey, she looks like a hot, melted Mr. Potato Head.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  There's definitely a Mr. Potato Head thing going on there.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  All right, let's go back to her talking. 
[00:12:00]  Chad, he spent hours with me.  He spent three days by my bedside when I was in ICU and that.  So, I mean, I can't tell you how good all doctors are.  I'm going to forget all of them.  But Ryan, he helped me with my sleep therapy.  We'll never forget you either.  I mean, I just can't say nothing about the team.  And I dropped the remote.  I mean, but what I really want to say is, I mean, even my daughter, I love her so much. 
[00:12:30]  She called me up.  Just out of the room, she called me and didn't even know I was having a bad day.  And she had Maddox in the background.  And I couldn't talk.  And she just loved my old dreams.  Ryan, shut up.  I have no idea what she's saying.  I know.  I can't even understand her.  Everyone's just sitting there all polite.  No one knows what you're saying.  Oh, you hear the cameras going off, though.  Oh, yeah.  They want pictures of this.  Keep talking so we can get as many pictures as possible.  I'm laughing because the descriptions of what she looks like, they're killing me. 
[00:13:00]  Listen to this one.  Todd in Jersey.  Todd.  That looks like the ghost of Pac-Man.  Oh, shit.  She looks like a Pac-Man ghost.  Yes.  Oh, that's horrible.  And this one.  Rod in Georgia.  Rod.  Peter Ran.  Chad from Weird Science.  Oh, right.  Chad from Weird Science after he was turned into a big pile of shit. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, God damn.  Chad from Weird Science.  Oh, fuck.  That's terrible.  Oh, shit.  So far.  So far.  That nails it.  Chet from Weird Science.  Oh, my God.  Hey, what did you do to me?  This next clip.  Maybe we shouldn't play because I think it's for you and I and Jimmy and our listeners.  It's titled Face Transplant Lady Tells People Not to Judge. 
[00:14:00]  Aw.  Well, don't judge.  Oh, what is that?  Look at Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs.  Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs.  There's another one.  That just looks like Chet with icing on him.  You know what?  I'm old school.  I'm all about the sideshow.  This used to be sideshow stuff.  Oh, yeah.  You'd put her in a circus.  You wouldn't allow the monsters to talk.  You would put them behind some kind of curtain.  You'd pay your quarter or your dollar and you would check this shit out. 
[00:14:30]  Now they're front and center doing press conferences.  I just want to say that when somebody has a dysfunctional man and don't look as pretty  as you do, don't judge them because you never know what happened to them.  I was shot.  I don't know.  Everybody knows that.  But I was shot.  And I don't want to go into it.  And I'm 46, so I was 40 years old when it happened. 
[00:15:00]  But that song, it says, you know, if I was 40, I could fly and all that.  Boy, that's when I hit him when that song came out.  And that came out that same year.  You never know what might happen to you.  You might get in a car wreck and think you're beautiful one day.  So don't judge people.  Don't look the same as you do.  You never know.  One day it might be all taken away.  So thank you all.  I think that's all I've got to say.  Thank you. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, I thought that was more gunfire.  Holy Jesus.  Kill it.  What's the wrong one she talking about?  I believe I can fly?  I believe I can.  Ah!  Wouldn't she be top heavy?  I mean, she can't fly.  No, no, no.  She's like the spruce goose.  I believe I can fly.  Here's another one.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Mark in Louisiana.  Mark!  Hi, guys.  Hey, Mark.  I'd like to introduce you to the 2009 champion of the Chubby Bunny podcast. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, God damn.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe.  Hi.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, you guys are all blowing it, man.  Yeah.  It's the latest Susan Boyle makeover.  Oh, that's Susan Boyle.  Punching out, guys.  All right.  Carl in Massachusetts.  Red Sox beat the Yankees last night.  Is that what happened?  Red Sox swept the Yankees again? 
[00:16:30]  Couldn't tell you.  Yeah.  No, I figured.  Don't follow him.  It did.  Gentlemen, it looks like Slimer from the Ghostbusters.  Slimer from Ghostbusters.  Yeah, you know, the same type of pointy-headed thing.  Hershey kiss head.  Oh, maybe that one.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, the cheekbones are there.  That's for sure.  Quagmire from Family Guy is coming in.  Robin in Detroit.  She's a regular to the show.  Looks like a Fat Albert character. 
[00:17:00]  That's Bill and Hoboken.  Oh, God.  Any Fraggle Rock fans out there?  You don't feel like the garbage ball from Fraggle Rock?  Garbage Pile from Fraggle Rock.  I need a reference point of that.  I haven't seen Fraggle Rock in a long time.  Let's see Garbage Pile.  One, but if you can find the music video to a song called Starlight by the Superman Lover,  she looks fucking exactly like that potato thing. 
[00:17:30]  Potato thing.  That potato thing.  Crunching out.  Thank you, Cody.  Wow.  A little bit, a little bit.  We're talking about face transplant, woman.  Yes.  If you turned the news on this morning or opened up a newspaper, you couldn't help but be horrified  by looking at it.  I kind of feel bad.  I'm laughing, but...  Yeah, it's one of those things, you know, she's probably been through some shit.  Yeah.  Fuck.  But this is all people are going to be talking about this morning. 
[00:18:00]  Look, every TV...  Yeah, they're showing what they did to her.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Which obviously is amazing.  Yeah, but they're showing it like it's just snapping on and everything was fine, but that  obviously isn't the case.  No.  Well, the whole middle of her face was not hers.  It wasn't there.  Right.  Below the eyes, all the way down in the jaw.  They had to rebuild the jaw and everything.  Yeah, she was just...  Do yourself a favor.  Try to find...  Not many newspapers are carrying the picture of her CAT scan where they show the bones and 
[00:18:30]  what happens to the bones after the shotgun blast.  It's amazing.  It's just all fragments below her eyes.  You know what the problem is, too, that she has thinny-thin hair.  She needs to have like a poofed-out hair more.  Oh, she needs big Farrah hair from the 70s.  Yeah, her hair, it just looks like a sheet of hair paper.  It's just too thin.  She put her head is too thin.  You're right.  Fluff that shit up a little bit.  It's too thin for the top of her head.  She needs that to be huge.  Hey, candy corn head, fuck that do up. 
[00:19:00]  Someone's got to check her cheeks with a tire pressure gauge.  Someone over-inflated her face.  Let's go to Steve, the trucker.  Steve.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Steve.  Hey, she looks like the trucking head dude off of Beetlejuice.  Oh.  Yeah, a little bit of that.  It's been a while.  Later, boys.  Thank you, sir.  And finally, Tony on Long Island.  Tony, how are you, buddy?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I want to know how long it's going to be until old Mashed Potato Face has a TLC program. 
[00:19:30]  You know, the...  No, I understand what you're saying.  You're on to the whole TLC thing.  TLC has turned into the Sideshow channel.  Oh, absolutely.  But they do these shows and make believe they're actually, you know, doing something for society.  But it's just an excuse to show...  To show freak shows.  To show weird people like the tree guy that has his whole body turning into a tree. 
[00:20:00]  You got the really heavy people that can't get out of bed anymore.  You got...  You got...  Wow, there's a whole bunch of them.  I mean, if you just look at the TLC schedule, you could sit in front of the TV for hours  and see this over and over again.  I hope.  I know you're a big fan of the freak show channel, so I thought I'd throw that out there.  I've been obsessed with freak shows my entire life.  Freak show channel.  And I think...  Well, boys, I'm going to punch out. 
[00:20:30]  You guys have a good day.  You do that.  And I thank Andrew Gore for giving me one of the best days of my life when I got to see  his private collection of stuff he's collected over the years.  Freakish memorabilia.  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy.  I couldn't go over his house.  I was just too creeped out by him.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable, actually.  He kind of creeped me out.  Really?  As a person, yeah.  He's actually a pretty cool dude.  Yeah, no, and he's been on the show and everything.  He was cool and all, but it just... 
[00:21:00]  What he's into is a little...  You don't like that morbid stuff, do you?  No, but the fucked up thing is, I will sit and watch all those A&E murder shows.  I love cold case file.  Yeah, I don't like that stuff.  And all that stuff.  It was a cold September morning.  She went out to the mall, and when she approached her car in the parking lot, a man came up behind  and then they'd talk about torture and fucking killed and body dumped somewhere.  And then, you know, I like seeing how the cops figured shit out. 
[00:21:30]  But...  You know what's weird about those shows?  I like the morbid shit.  You mentioned the mall.  Yeah.  What those shows are great at, they make the mall parking lot on a really nice sunny day  look like the creepiest place in the world.  Yeah, yeah.  A horrible place to go and be.  Just how they'd film it and just how they'd throw in a little music.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden you're like, that's a horror show now.  Ah, the mall parking lot.  Ah!  Oh.  It's nice. 
[00:22:00]  Yes.  Cold case files.  Do you want to take more phone calls?  I'm Bill...  What's his name?  Bill Curtis.  Bill Curtis.  When we return, the trial of the cut people's dicks off and shove them down their mouth killer.  It's like some horrible guy.  He's got some great commercials on TV right now.  Yeah, yeah.  They're kind of using him for that.  I don't know.  I kind of think that that ruins his credibility. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, but I think he's done.  Like it's funny and everything, but to watch him doing the cold case files and other crime  shows like that, he has such credibility and that voice and he's walking to the courtroom.  We'll tell you what happened right after this break.  I would never want him as a friend.  A friend?  I bet you he hasn't filmed one of those in years.  I bet you they're all really old shows.  They are old shows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah.  Okay.  Let me say hi to Joe in Boston. 
[00:23:00]  Joe!  Well, that's...  My spit.  It's everywhere.  Ah, good for this lady.  What can I tell you?  Beach the option, I guess.  Yeah, you know, I mean, it's nice that they got some kind of option for people that have  lost their faces.  Like she's not pleasant to look at, but it's like you don't know, like you're not going  to run screaming.  Right.  Like if you look at it, you're just like, yeah, that's an odd looking lady.  Yeah.  I got people in my family that are uglier than this woman.  Simple as that.  And they didn't have a face transplant. 
[00:23:30]  It is better than it was.  Not my immediate family, by the way.  We're all gorgeous.  We all could have been models.  Little kids might still look like, mother, there's a pile of mashed potatoes with glasses  talking to me.  Her nickname is going to be old Wispy Wing.  Richard Dreyfuss is slapping her cheeks going, I know this.  This means something.  Yes.  Yes.  Close encounters.  Old devil's tower head. 
[00:24:00]  Looks like shit demon from Dogma.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  That's Ty in Ohio.  I don't have time to get to him.  Great.  Two piles of shit, she looks like.  Jim in New York.  How are you, Jim?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up?  I got two questions.  Yeah.  One, would you let the monster blow you for the goofback?  I would.  I was just going to answer, yeah, without a doubt.  You know.  You do stuff for the story.  I might have to videotape it and let my friends watch just if it kicks. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And the second thing is, would you hook it up with half a Hulk face?  I'd really watch the fun begin.  Wow, yeah.  Wow, that's right.  Her and a half a Hulk face.  Wow, I was right.  Well, we got together and fell in love.  Thanks, fellas.  Punch it out.  I didn't know you could do half a Hulk face.  Yeah.  You just got to cut her.  It's pretty easy.  It's more physical than anything else.  You notice we turned him around?  First time he came around, he was an angry motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  Angry.  And now he accepts it and he knows, you know. 
[00:25:00]  He's embraced and loved by people.  He has embraced the whole half a Hulk face thing now.  You know why?  He knows, like, if he goes to an O&A event or something like that, like, everyone knows who he is.  So they're not going to look and go, eh, ah, ah.  Yeah.  They look at him and go, hey, half a Hulk face, what's up?  They're actually getting to know him as a person.  You make a very good point.  I know we like to make a lot of jokes on this show.  We like to make a mockery of everything.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:25:30]  Especially people's misfortune.  But if he walks through a mall, people are pointing, staring, running, screaming.  But an O&A event, people go, have Hulk faces here?  Yeah.  They take their quick look.  Hey, have Hulk face.  Oh, wow, okay.  Can I get a picture with you?  And then they start talking to you.  For real?  Yeah.  And then there's some chit-chat.  And you realize, you know, yeah, the guy's not, you know, he's actually a guy.  Hey, we're helping by making fun of people. 
[00:26:00]  Are we?  Yeah.  That's how I get, that's how I sleep.  Well, that's the story.  That's the number one story today, obviously.  We'll get back into that a little later.  It's a piggy.  Yeah, Red Sox beat the Yankees for the big sweep.  Mets beat the Braves 4-3.  Brett Favre.  Yes, I heard this on my way in.  No.  He will be playing football next year.  Why?  Oh, God.  It's still a rumor, but it's obvious.  No, they're showing clips. 
[00:26:30]  They're talking too much about it.  Yeah.  Like it's going to happen.  For the Vikings.  For the Vikings is right.  Yeah.  And the why is very simple, Jimmy.  How much would he make?  10 million?  Yeah.  8 million?  What does Brett Favre work?  No, no, no.  Not him, but why would they?  Oh, why?  Well.  Yeah.  Why would they take him, right?  Probably, you know, get some fannies in the seats.  Yeah, people would be like, hey, look, Brett Favre.  You know, I yelled and screamed when the Jets were thinking about this move. 
[00:27:00]  I was like, not on the Brett Favre train whatsoever.  No, huh?  You know, he's a great, he's a Hall of Famer, obviously, and all that, but you watch.  He'll play for the Vikings next year.  One more season for Brett Favre.  He wants revenge on Packers.  Travis says he wants revenge on Packers.  Really?  He's still kind of pissed off.  Yeah, and if he plays for the Vikings, he can face the Packers twice, and that's the  only team that would take him. 
[00:27:30]  Everyone else has a quarterback already.  I was going to ask, because I don't know that much.  I don't go deep with football.  So the Vikings really are desperate for a quarterback, Travis?  Yeah.  Maybe Sam knows.  Yeah, and anyone will take, well, not anyone, but they would take Brett Favre if it's better  than the option they have right now.  Who is that, Fran Tarkenton?  I have no idea.  Making a comeback?  He just made an old school Vikings joke.  Yes.  I like that.  Fran Tarkenton. 
[00:28:00]  You want some facts to feel old today?  I thought I just made one.  That's a good one.  There's a few things going on.  Yeah.  A very famous baseball player.  It's his birthday today.  Do you know?  Did you look at the sheet?  Pumpsy Green.  Pumpsy Green.  No.  What was the thing?  Very famous baseball player.  What about him?  Retired.  It's his birthday today.  And when I tell you how old he is, it's going to make people feel very old today.  He retired.  What team did he play for?  Well, that'll pretty much give it away. 
[00:28:30]  But the Giants.  Baseball Giants?  Mets.  Willie Mays?  Willie Mays.  Willie Mays.  Say hey, Willie.  Give yourself a bill!  I don't want to get any questions right.  I acknowledge I do that to annoy people.  Say hey, Willie.  I'm going to guess he's 57 years young. 
[00:29:00]  No, Uncle Paul.  How old for real would you think Willie Mays is?  I would say 70.  78.  Wow.  70 fucking 8 years old.  Jesus.  Here's one for Bob Seger 63.  But here's a more important music question.  37 years ago today, a very, very popular song was released.  37 years ago.  Give me the year.  I don't want to do math.  60, no, 72? 
[00:29:30]  19 and 72.  19 to 05?  You could ask a couple questions because, you know.  A very famous song.  Which one?  Was it a big number one hit?  I would assume it was.  I'm not looking at any text because I want to know this.  I would assume it was a number one hit.  I'll bet you think this song is about you, don't you?  Don't you?  You're so vain.  Ugh.  No.  What genre of music is it? 
[00:30:00]  Rock.  Softer rock.  Yeah.  Solo artist.  Oh, I know it.  Chick?  Sort of.  That's a really good hit right there.  Wow.  All right.  Sort of.  Is it a really ugly woman or a lesbian?  Looks like an old lesbian. 
[00:30:30]  Tiny Tim?  No.  No, no, no.  Looks like an old lesbian.  Then or now?  Back then, bald.  Now, old lesbian.  Elton John?  Yes.  Okay, wow.  Okay.  Give yourself a bail.  A bail?  Um, a song?  Yeah.  Rocket Man.  Yeah.  Rocket Man.  Fucking Rocket Man.  Give myself a bail! 
[00:31:00]  37 years ago.  I'm not the man.  They think I am at all.  No, no, no, no.  I'm a rocket man.  Rocket man.  Do you like Elton John?  For real.  I don't turn it off, but I don't search it out.  This song is phenomenal.  Leave On is the best song he ever did.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I like Funeral for a Friend. 
[00:31:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because it's so epic.  It takes forever.  I know, it does.  For us old rock jocks, that was a great one to play.  Oh, take a big dump, get a blowjob, whatever you need to do.  All the above.  The old, yeah.  The old I got some time to spare song, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I should have some of my old friends call up.  The ones I taught radio.  On the spot.  Here, you put this song on.  See, when this one ends, what you do is push play on this. 
[00:32:00]  Fade down that fader.  Oh.  And I'll be back in ten minutes.  I'll be back lickety split.  My friends used to come by in Rochester just to say hi after the bars closed,  because I was, like, loser douchebag that had to do the overnights.  Yeah.  And I would teach them how to do radio for many, many reasons.  Yeah, of course.  That's all I'll say right now.  Many reasons.  Elton John's songs are probably amongst the hardest to interpret the words from  that I've ever known. 
[00:32:30]  There's so many of his songs that I don't know what the fuck he's saying.  And as a kid, when you're trying to, like, sing along in the car,  it's not a clue.  Still, to this day, there are so many songs.  I don't know what the fuck he's saying in them.  You know, you make a great point.  I just kind of, like, make up words when I try to sing along.  Yeah, he's one of the worst ever as far as Elton John finding the, like,  trying to guess what the lyrics are to his songs.  This one's not that bad because it's kind of slow and you can hear,  but, like, Benny and the Jets, I think, is one. 
[00:33:00]  What does Benny and the Jets mean?  I don't know.  Crocodile Rock is another one that, like, put on Crocodile Rock.  That song fucking stinks.  It stinks.  It stinks on ice.  I like to say, on ice.  But it's like, what the fuck is he saying?  Why are you still playing this?  It kind of is nice.  Yeah, it's kind of, we ought to just play this all day.  It's making me happy inside.  He wasn't saying Crocodile Rock.  He was actually saying Cock.  A mile of Cock.  Yeah, the times were different, so, you know. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Here it goes.  I remember when Rock was.  Yeah, you can see that.  You didn't have a Susie.  Susie.  You had a stand.  All right.  Here we go now.  Had a no-go-shave and a place of my own.  But the biggest kick I ever got.  Had a something and a place of my own.  The biggest kick I ever got.  It's a little later on.  Get the lyrics, actually.  Here it comes.  Now this part. 
[00:34:00]  See, he changed it up, so that was a very important part of the song.  I know that that is.  Never will.  Yeah.  And then what?  All right.  Oh, Lord, Mama.  It's obvious.  He's singing about simple times.  Is that it?  When you picked up your broad and went to the ice cream joint.  No, no, no, no.  And had an ice cream soda. 
[00:34:30]  You're fruit.  And then you watched the submarine races.  Yeah.  He had a submarine in his mouth.  He sure did, man.  He sure did.  He was racing to his tonsils.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Well, I heard the song enough where you kind of know the words after a while.  But he's a big perpetrator of I don't know what the fuck he's singing about.  Yeah, there's a lot of them out there.  Yeah.  Benny and the Jets is a terrible song, too.  Benny.  Benny.  Benny.  Benny and the Jets.  Terrible song. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, horrid.  We're going to have to go to break, Travis, with a little Levon.  Yeah.  We're going to get into the hook.  We won't play the whole song, but why not?  Like that one.  I love Levon, actually.  When they're singing it on the bus in Almost Famous.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  You ever see Almost Famous?  I did, but I didn't love it.  I got to see that movie again.  I'm not sure if I'd like it.  I've never seen it.  Almost Famous?  Yeah.  I just...  Nothing I really want to say there.  Nothing to see here.  Final episode of Friends five years ago today, whatever.  Babe Ruth hit his first home run how many years ago? 
[00:35:30]  Wait a minute.  A hundred.  Almost, yeah.  Ninety-four.  Wow.  Ninety-four years ago.  Ninety-four years?  Mm-hmm.  Goddamn.  That's a long fucking time ago.  All right.  Want to take our first break?  Let us do that.  With a little leave-on.  Yeah.  For your Wednesday morning.  And leave us on in the interim. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, good gravy.  Good gosh.  Start the song.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And you're going to be a pilgrim.  Thank you.  Left on with his war wound like a crown.  Because he's a child, Jesus. 
[00:36:30]  Because he's a child, Jesus.  Because he likes the maid.  And he sends him to the finest school in town  Leave on, leave on lots of money  He makes a lot the same 
[00:37:00]  Spends his days  Hello?  Hello? I am the biggest idiot ever  Yeah?  I already know that  You go to break now  No, no, no, no, no  I'm pumping up Elton John  I'm pumping up Almost Famous  I'm pumping up the sing-along on the bus  And I got the wrong fucking song  This ain't the song  This song stinks, by the way  I do like Leave On, though  What do we do now?  What song do you like? 
[00:37:30]  Everyone told me, everybody  It came in a million times  Tiny Dancer  Yes!  Tiny Dancer  It's Tiny Dancer, not Leave On  I'm an idiot  Now what do we do?  Well  Put Tiny Dancer on and go to break  Yeah?  That will conclude the gay hour  It certainly will  Holy crap  I'm heating up  I'm so embarrassed right now  It's that bad?  Oh yeah, I'm heating up  I'm so embarrassed  Making a nice statement about a cool song  From an alright movie  Yeah  And I'm talking about the wrong song 
[00:38:00]  Give me a little Tiny Dancer  We'll be back  Blue jean baby  Yeah, lady lady  Yeah, lady lady  Seems just for the band  Pretty eyes

[00:40:30]  Slowly  Hold me close  A tiny dancing  Count the headlights  On the highway  Baby girl  And she's sublending  Lay me down and she's sublending 
[00:41:00]  I'm doing the best I ever did  I'm doing the best thing I've been  And today  Today  You better go away

Box tops  Well, it's kind of the same thing  You got a box bottom  You got the box and the bottom

Yeah  Yeah, take it out so we can just look at it without the um  I was telling Anthony, though  Let's violate it  If I was 14 years old  What I would do to this thing  Better than anything you can get  My mom would be confused  Why are you going to bed at 8.30 again, Greg?  Well, I got some shit to do in my room 
[00:44:30]  Yeah  My mom would be confused  What's that thing you and your father keep hosing out?  Oh, fuck  We gotta close the curtains for that  What?  I'll tell you why  Why?  It's because  Because we're about to have fun  Well, yeah, exactly  If someone  Fun is imminent  It could offend  Oh, this is Danny, by the way  If someone looks in and sees it  They could potentially be offended  You know, that's why broads have no business doing radio  Right  This is all about broads  Yeah  Oh, well  It could also be the two guys walking by 
[00:45:00]  To the studio  They don't know what it is  Yeah, what is that?  Like I said  It's all about broads  It's missing a few things  And I respect broads when I'm not doing a radio show  Of course  You'd be surprised how much I actually respect broads  We have great respect for the skirt  But in radio, not so much  Because this is what happens  You've got to put curtains up  To look at a  At a  Wait, what is it again?  It's curtain C  Yeah, give it the full name  At a doggy style  Vibrating pussy and ass 
[00:45:30]  You know, there's no guesswork  As to what's in that box  I'll tell you that  I guarantee someone tried to sell this to Walmart  Like, look, what we want to do  Oh, fuck  We'd like Walmart to exclusively carry this product  What is it?  It's a cyber skin doggy style  Vibrating pussy and ass  Oh, they won't put this on their shelves  But they'll sell you a gun  They'll sell you ammunition  Shut the fuck up  Stupid argument  Shut up  That would be a hard thing to hide, too 
[00:46:00]  In your room as a kid  That's what I was getting at  When I was 14  I built pussies  Yeah  Did you build pussies?  Well, you were lucky  I jacked it  But you were getting laid very young  Yeah, but I was jacking off a lot earlier than I got laid  But would you make stuff?  Yeah, I would fuck things around the house  I did tube socks  Yeah, really?  Yeah  That wasn't so much for pleasure  As it was just for easy cleanup 
[00:46:30]  Well  If I didn't want to, like, get up and have to clean up  Or worry that there's going to be a stain in my bed  You would roll the tube socks in such a way, Jimmy  Oh, yeah  Oh, you would do that?  Oh, yeah  For pleasure?  Just to  Just to  Just to  Just to  Just to  Feel it going in something  Yes  Thank you  Just have it go in something  Could I put this in something, please?  Yes  It was just more to have the sensation that it was actually going into something  That you were actually sliding it into something instead of just grip and rip 
[00:47:00]  Yeah  And then I did the primitive pillow thing  If I had this, though  Holy mackerel  But, like, you just were saying it  You'd have to hide this from mom and daddy  I did  Would you hide this in your room?  Wow  Let me think where I would hide that as a kid  Let me  I'm picturing my room  Where could I fucking put that?  That mom wouldn't  Because mom went in there  She'd make the bed  She'd open up the closet  Because she was constantly, like, saying stuff like 
[00:47:30]  You know, your closet's a mess  So you can't put it in there  Your drawer  She would put laundry in your drawer  I'd be fucking  Well  I'd have to, like, put a light  I'd screw a light bulb in its ass and say it was a lamp  My mom had  Has the OCD so bad  If we, like, had our sneakers, like, just hanging out  In the wrong place in our room  She would destroy our rooms  What are you, buying it a drink?  What?  Open the fucking box  Pull it out  Handling it with care  It's not really her  Hope he's trying to actually make time with it  And make it like 
[00:48:00]  Make it like him  I didn't want to destroy the packaging  Yeah  In case we have to return it  Yes  Do you think they take returns on that?  There's tapioca in this  For my mom  Tapioca  Potato flakes  My mom was known to rip apart our room  So I wouldn't be able to hide this in my room  Yeah  So I'd have to  I used to bury, like, porn  What did you have, like, fucking  What do they call that?

See, everyone's saying we can't tweet that shit  No? 
[00:59:00]  I think if you make it more  Making it  Make it look more like a face  I would  And then we're all in on the joke  Knowing what it really is  Yeah  That would be the way to go  I defy you  What if we cover up the  The bung?  The bung  You just don't want to get your account  And yank  Cause them, MySpace  Any of them are so fucking weird  About anything sexual  Cause there's no age restriction  On having the  I know  That's what sucks  Yeah  Language is one thing  You can use harsh language 
[00:59:30]  Yeah  They would definitely  Get mad at that  Yeah, but language is different  What is?  Language  The problem is not really  You know what I mean  Like images are fucked up  But I mean  I think any type of language  Is acceptable  That's annoying  What is?  The way you say that word  What?  I just don't like to use harsh language  Where's David?  He's on a breakfast  Yeah, he's on a breakfast run  Cause he's gotta do his Wolverine movie review  Ah  Yeah, I wanna hear that  Hey, what happened to Kiefer Sutherland last night? 
[01:00:00]  Uh, well, as Travis says  Uh, he was dreamy as ever  Uh, Travis has such a man crush  Is that 24 still on?  On him  Is 24 still on?  Of course it is  I saw the first two seasons  Loved the show  I was all in  Then you'd love the next four  And then out of  No, you wouldn't  Then out of nowhere  I just decided to stop watching the show  That happens sometimes  That type of thing happens, right?  Yep  Like, I'm not sure if I'm gonna watch  Rescue Me this year  And I love Rescue Me  Damn, yeah  How many seasons of Rescue Me?  Three?  This is the fourth, maybe? 
[01:00:30]  I've watched every episode  And I got the new season DVR'd  I'm not really sure if I'm watching yet  I don't know  We, uh, you know, uh  Sometimes you just kinda lose interest in a show  But why?  Cause I like Rescue Me  Yeah  I have no problem with Rescue Me  And Adam's on it  I was excited, uh, you know  That it was coming back finally  Maybe because they take way too long  In between seasons  They really do, yeah  And 24, the reason why I stopped watching that 
[01:01:00]  It's just that they just  Are we doing the same exact fucking show?  No, they're not  Year after year  Oh  What's different about 24 this year?  Travis  Well, this year  Uh, a most unlikely villain  Is on the show  Someone who used to be good  But now is bad  The president?  No  I don't even know  I don't know that show from a hole in the wall  Jack Bauer  The show's ridiculous  Is Jack Bauer a bad guy?  Of course not  He saves the world  He's a drunk  He saves the world  He doesn't save the world 
[01:01:30]  And the show's ridiculous  Cause you can't do all that stuff in 24 hours  In 24 hours  If you're Jack Bauer  It's dumb  If you're Jack Bauer  Yeah  Yeah, of course  How many episodes a season?  24?  Yeah  24 hours  Yeah  It's an hour an episode  Duh  Do they do a whole hour where he just eats lunch?  Yeah, why doesn't he just sit there eating?  When does he use the toilet?  He doesn't need to  No, you gotta show him using the turlet  If it's every fucking, like, hour  Wouldn't they show? 
[01:02:00]  And I know it's hack  Cause I heard that  People mentioned it before  But what  Does he eat?  Yeah  And what do they do  When he's eating?  They show what the terrorists are up to  Oh  You have to assume  Oh  That that's when he's eating  That when  When they're showing what the bad guy  Whenever he's off camera  He's pissing or eating or shitting  Yeah, we're sleeping  We're sleeping  We're fucking  We're fucking, yeah  Are they Islamic terrorists?  No  Of course they're not  What are they?  Why would they be?  What have they done that?  Swedish  They've done that like three times though  Oh, they have?  Okay  Yeah  Who's the bad guy? 
[01:02:30]  John Voight  No, alright  But what does he do?  John Voight  Is he mafia?  Is he what?  No, John Voight  John Voight  Old CIA guy that went bad  He runs like a private army company  That's, you know  Outsourced by the government  And he is  He's trying to create some terrorist attacks  In the United States  So that they can kind of take over  Holy shit  How long was I out?  No  Holy shit  Wait a minute  No, I just 
[01:03:00]  Was he talking?  And I was trying  Oh, god damn  I was actually trying  Thinking  Oof, I thought I missed the whole show  Well, this is what happened to Kiefer Sutherland  Last night  He head-butted a fashion designer  He thinks he's Jack Power  Yeah  Sounds to me like he's Jack Ass  Oh, Jimmy  Language  Yes  What's the deal with Kiefer?  Because  Put a battery up its ass  When Jimmy taped Letterman  Kiefer Sutherland  Just a very nice  Mellow guy  Couldn't have been nicer  And then what happens with him  Where he like tackles Christmas trees 
[01:03:30]  And head-butts people  It's called alcoholism  That's what I was getting at  Is he into the sauce there?  Travis?  Travis?  Apparently, allegedly  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, he's drunk driving  He's such an alcoholic  He did 48 days in jail  Yeah, but apparently  He takes care of it very well  It's never interfered  With his, like, professional life  Professional  But he's gone to jail  For 48 days in jail, hasn't he?  Yeah  For DUI  Oh, he likes his drink  He does  Oh, yeah  Oh, my God  Yeah, look at him  His pants are down 
[01:04:00]  Wait a minute  What is that picture?  Hold on  What's the picture with him  With his pants down?  That's just him at a bar  Just hanging out?  But his pants are down  He's sitting in a booth  He's sitting in a booth  With his pants down  Yeah  Around his ankles  Why is he doing that, Travis?  Because he's Kiefer Sutherland  And then what's the other picture  With his  I think that's just like  A little montage  Of drunk pictures  Of drunk pictures  Is that the one  After he jumped  Through the Christmas tree?  The one on the bottom  Yeah  Has he ever tried to  Get a handle on his alcoholism? 
[01:04:30]  I don't think so  Because it's never affected  His professional life  He just needs a handle on it  He's doing fine  He likes drinking  He's drinking perfectly  Is he grabbing his wiener  Under the table?  He's pulling his cock out  Or something  What the fuck?  Yeah, it looks like  His pants and underwear are down  As he's sitting in a booth  What is wrong with him?  He's the best  Well, this is what he did last night  Well, we have some breaking news  From the entertainment world  For you right now  It looks as though  Keeper Sutherland  Maybe taking his role  On 24  Maybe a little bit too seriously 
[01:05:00]  Reports are  Sutherland head-butted  A fashion designer  In the nose  And broke it  At a black tie party  Last night  Tonight  That fashion designer  Is filing a complaint  And nursing that nose  He's been identified  As Jack McCullough  Half of the design duo  Proenza Schooler  Sources say  The luck has started  Because Sutherland  Was upset about something  That had to do with  Brooke Shields  One of its former co-stars  Oh my god  Nice buzz  Hey, what is that 
[01:05:30]  Of Brooke Shields?  Like, I didn't say anything  I'm a  Fuck you, conk  Nice buzz  Him and Brooke  Were talking  And apparently  This guy  Walked between them  And bumped into Brooke  And Kiefer started  Being blistering  Is this true?  Yes  And said you should  Apologize to her  I don't know what  Happened between them  But they started  An argument  And then he head-butted them  But he wanted  The guy to apologize  To Brooke  Is he and Brooke  Maybe an item?  Are they an item?  Not from what I've heard  No, I just think  He was drunk  I just think  He was drunk  Yeah, he was  From what I've heard  About Kiefer 
[01:06:00]  She would not be an item  They should call  The show  Point two four  Fucking guy  That's coming from me  Well, we got  Celebrities acting badly  Oh, another one  Why not?  Fly  Why not?  Ah, yeah, no  Feeny  Away from me, man  Wow, nothing  Relax  Walk, walk, walk 
[01:06:30]  It's alright, man  F*** off  Nobody wants to  F*** out  Hey, man  Do it  Wow  Jim  Do it  Do it  Come on  You're not cool, man  Do it  They're right  They're right  We're here  Now, let's go  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  Now I'm gonna call the cops on you, man  Call  Gandolfini  Go fuck  Man, this isn't cool  You shouldn't come to Waverly Inn  If you don't want to see the paparazzi  I forgot  That's not cool 
[01:07:00]  Fuck you  Fuck you  I agree  I might have to take  Which side are you taking?  I might have to take the opposite  I'm taking Gandolfini's side  Gandolfini  I'll tell you why  I have to sort of take the other side  This Waverly Inn in New York City  Is a place  Celebrities go  Knowing  That there's a million photographers outside  Let me tell you something  There's a million restaurants you could eat at  In New York City  Where you wouldn't run into one of these guys  They're scumbags  But the point I'm making 
[01:07:30]  Because they have this shit in LA too  The Waverly Inn is a place to be seen  And people go there to be seen  Let me tell you something  The food isn't that great  It's a place you go to get pictures taken by the paparazzi  How about  Simple as that  How about  Any night of the week  This Waverly Inn has these assholes out front  Any night  Any night of the week  He's going after the  And the photographer  And he's a scumbag  You know  He said it  He goes  Well if you don't want your picture taken  Why are you going to the Waverly Inn? 
[01:08:00]  Because everyone knows  The celebrities go there  For a photo op  That's the only reason you go there  Look at Gandolfini pushing people  Yeah  He's fucking Tony Soprano in this one  Look at him  Right  Oh and then they're leaving  Alright but if he's going to be annoyed by that  There's literally a million restaurants you could eat in  I don't know  In New York City  And you wouldn't run into one of these guys  I don't know  Maybe  And the same thing happens in LA  Look they're scumbags  But the same thing happens in LA  There's that  The Robertson Boulevard 
[01:08:30]  Celebrities walk down that street  To get their pictures taken  And then lose their minds like  How dare you take my picture  You know what though  It's such a phony fucking thing that is happening  You know what else is phony  The fucking photographer's comments  Hey hey hey  Leave me alone  Stop  That's not right  Big fan  You know  Shut the fuck up  All that's bullshit  Shut up  They're posturing for a lawsuit  Yeah all that's bullshit  They're assholes  The picture is one thing to get money  And the lawsuit's the other  Right  They're hoping to get fucking punched in the face  They're assholes  And okay 
[01:09:00]  You know  The celebrities go into the restaurants like that  The only point I'm making is  You've heard of the Waverly Inn no?  You know something?  No  I'm not savvy  I think it's somewhere in the West Village  And it literally is a place where  Where if you go there  You're going to see a million photographers just waiting  Maybe they had  Maybe he wanted to go there  Because he heard all that man of golf  Was going to die  Like my mother used to make  Like a sauce like my mother would make  Where's the sauce?  You put the sauce 
[01:09:30]  You put the sauce  You there  You shut up  Ah the pork  We go to the pork store  Get the fresh pork  Not that's not from the grocery store  The fresh pork  It melts in your mouth  It melts in your mouth  Sliced as thin as Mrs. Gabagadoosh  Used to make it  Yuck  Yeah you got that  You got some gabagio sauce  I should be able to go to my favorite restaurant  And get some scungil  I get that  It's got the best scungil  Like my grandma 
[01:10:00]  And she passed it out to my mother  Used to make her the best scungil  Melt in your mouth  She put with the sauce  We call it gravy  Shut up  Yeah  That's like a black guy walking around  Just talking about watermelons  When Italians get like that  It's such a stereotype  Like my mother used to make  Oh Maron  Yeah  Maron  Mingi  Could I use that now?  Mingi  Do I miss a guy  Rest a soul  Shut it 
[01:10:30]  Anybody could whip up that crap  Yeah this  Where is drive me  I know I know where it is  Danny's on ground view  On the street level  On Bank Street  Down in the lower west side  But where is it?  I think it's the West Village  Where is it on the picture Dan?  I think it's in the West Village  Google Maps is  Google  We won't be ignored Dan  Not doing so well  You can't get the street level?  But do you understand what I'm saying?  Not that it's a big deal  That this is 
[01:11:00]  This is not a place to go  If you  If you're trying to be  Under the radar  This is a place you go  Knowing  These  These  These animals  Are going to be out there  With their cameras  Oh sorry you missed  There's a picture of her in a tux  What?  Faceplant  Oh really?  Yeah in a tux  Oh god  She has to  Wow that does look like  The fucking vagina asshole  I know  It's too bad we can't  We got the greatest  Picture for Twitter  Oh my god look  Yeah she's at a podium  Yes  She's accepting an award  From that  Fucking

[01:12:30]  They fuck up for people like me  Who really do want a photo  Yeah  Ye Waverly  In  Yeah  It's a celebrity hot spot  And everyone knows that  And the paparazzi  When they have nothing else going on  They just sit out there  And take pictures of  The celebrities going in and out  Oh there's the menu  Oh the oysters  Oh we'll get some oysters  Yeah  Oh we'll just eat some claims  You want some claims  You know what I discovered  When I was in Florida

Huh?  Does she kick in? 
[01:21:00]  I don't know  I don't like the roof  I only like this  You hear me?  I got a chicken  I got a pan  Song rules  Let's say hi to Trish  In Philly  Trish 
[01:21:30]  Hey, Trish, I just drove past a Popeye's chicken in Broomall, Pennsylvania, which is outside of Philly,  and you don't get much whiter than Broomall, so there's your answer.  See, I go down to Philly a lot.  Might be going down this weekend, but I can't eat the Popeyes when I have to eat the cheesesteak when I'm down there.  I don't know what to tell you, but if you're in Broomall, in Lawrence Park, there's one.  All right, thank you.  All right, no problem.  Hey, Jimmy, you ever had a Philly cheesesteak?  Not one that has been brought up to New York City.  No. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, like fraiche?  Oh, good God.  I'm sure I haven't.  Right out of the jerks and filling.  See, people think I'm this health nut, but I do my cheesesteaks.  Oh, not health.  I never see you eat that.  Health never comes into it.  Yes.  I never see you eat that.  I know you do occasionally.  You always tell us.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You give us fun reports.  Like, I had a good time.  I was eating fucking juniper berries and fucking pickled toad's feet.  But we're around here.  You're like, what do you have?  I'll have two egg whites and a broccoli spear. 
[01:22:30]  I can see Opie just sitting on his bed crying, eating a whole cheesecake, and then purging  into the toilet.  Yeah, we never see that.  What's a broccoli spear, by the way?  Piece of broccoli.  Broccoli.  Why do they call it a spear?  Because.  Wouldn't it be that?  I thought asparagus was described as spear.  Asparagus spear.  What happened?  You do.  What happened?  Either this is the truth, or it's one of the most racist things I've ever heard of.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Maybe you should write a note first.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm giving Danny the edge. 
[01:23:00]  It's a red-yellow.  We'll give it like one of these.  I'll write it down.  All right.  If you want to read it, you can read it.  Proceed with caution.  Proceed with caution.  Please be warned.  Please be warned.  Pull up.  Pull up.  All right.  Found you.  Oh, this is the communique that was received. 
[01:23:30]  Steve wrote this?  Yes.  Steve wrote from the office.  Jesus.  Would seem that Patrice could add to the chicken talk, but that's just me.  Yeah.  What the fuck is wrong with him?  All right.  Patrice is here.  We're going to take a break.  Oh, yeah.  You can't make Patrice.  I can't disagree with Steve.  Popeye's near Fenway.  Definitely a white neighborhood.  Popeye's is useless without the dirty rice.  What the fuck is the dirty rice, Sean? 
[01:24:00]  Sean, I love rice.  The Cajun rice you can get with them.  It's called dirty rice.  I've heard of dirty rice.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I could have gotten dirty rice.  Could have gotten dirty rice.  Motherfucker.  Who's the porn star running for Senate?  Thank you, sir.  Oh, a new photo.  Oh.  Oh, they're still showing that.  Fucking.  They're still showing.  That does look creepy, though, man.  That looks a little too close.  Oh.  Oh, this guy.  Dan the trucker, and then we'll move on.  Trucker Dan, actually.  What's up, sir?  Dan. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, guys.  I haven't talked to you in a while.  How are you?  Good, sir.  Welcome back, Dan.  Yeah, thanks.  I lost my...  My XM broke for three weeks.  I wouldn't have thought of you if you died and never called in again.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  It's like, trucker who?  I've called about that.  Now, welcome back, Dan.  Welcome back to the fray.  All right.  What do you got for the show?  How you been?  I'm doing all right.  I stop at Popeye's about twice a week out on the road.  They're at a truck stop of America.  Nearly every one of them have one.  And they're right.  The dirty rice is it, man. 
[01:25:00]  The red beans and rice and dirty rice.  Look, I still feel guilty that I ate Popeye's five days ago or four days ago.  How much do you weigh, Dan, eating this twice a week?  Oh, I'm your typical truck driver.  I weighed 210 when I started trucking four years ago, and I weigh 270 now.  Oh, wow.  Well, what else are you supposed to do?  Most of these service areas have shit food.  That's it.  I got me an electric cooler now, and I stock up at Walmart, like, you know, just little, 
[01:25:30]  like, fish and tuna fish.  It's good for hooker parts, too.  Yeah, sure.  And fruit now.  Fingers with a ring on them.  Fucking ankle bones.  He keeps little trinkets.  Vaginas like the one we have in here, but real.  I don't waddle as much when I walk now.  All right.  I lost about 30 pounds in the last two months.  Dan, congratulations, Dan.  God love you.  With a call like that, don't stay away.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  See you, Dan.  The other thing?  Two words for Dan.  Jackknife.  Yes.  Right now, it'd be great. 
[01:26:00]  As we were talking, we just heard the fucking, the guardrail snap, and he goes over a cliff.  That distinct sound of tractor-trailer tires going sideways down the road.  And the sound of an electric cooler fucking going through the windshield as it flips.  With his head in front of it.  What did Dan do?  Nothing.  He's just a cordial caller and wear asses.  He's breathing.  The other thing?  Mm-hmm.  Fresh pink.  Pussy. 
[01:26:30]  No, it's a yes.  Fresh pink grapefruits.  It's a very good.  I hate grapefruit.  Oh, my.  Yeah, but because something happens to the stupid fruit between Florida and here.  Is that it?  They sell that fresh pink grapefruit everywhere.  Does it taste like an orange?  Is it sweet and not fucking tangy and bitter?  Yes.  It's ridiculous.  Oh.  And you cannot get a fresh grapefruit in New York.  Why?  What happens in the two days it takes to get the stupid fruit to us?  It loses all its vitamins and minerals. 
[01:27:00]  I hate grapefruit because it's not sweet.  I love it.  If I eat a fruit, I want it.  I want him to be.  I want it to be sweet and tasty.  We're trying to go to break, so.  I mean, he can.  Why didn't Steve just bring him in?  It's green.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Yeah, man.  You ever have a Texas pink grapefruit?  Where would I have that?  I don't know.  Sam's Club.  Is that big?  No, it's not that big.  Because everything's bigger in Texas.  You know who turned me on to the Texas pink grapefruit?  Pugs and Kelly.  Lee Harvey Oswald. 
[01:27:30]  Exactly.  Jack Ruby.  Oh, Governor Connolly.  Oh, fatso did.  Clay Shaw.  David's Ferry turns on to it.  Can't do it.  Grapefruit.  I've had it for years.  Grapefruit with a wig on it.  Jim Garrison.  Mr. X.  Grapefruit's in your aisle, Bubba.  The answer will surprise you.  Yeah.  E to the rock.  E rock.  Turn me on to the Texas pink grapefruit. 
[01:28:00]  It must be fattening somehow.  Exactly.  It's got fucking fudge on it.  It's a grapefruit.  You open up the grapefruit skin.  It's all just chocolate.  It's amazing.  Miracle.  It's fucking guacamole and chocolate in it.  There's no fruit value whatsoever.  We deep fried that shit.  Thank you, Jim and Florida.  Fry that grapefruit.  I'm with you, O.  Fry that grapefruit.  Let's say hi to Lady...  Is this Lady Trucker?  Uh-oh.  Yes, it is.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Stop Twittering me fucking pictures of fat bitches.  And enough of your dumb insults, Lady Trucker. 
[01:28:30]  Stop.  Just be a human being.  Yeah.  Stop.  Be a human being and lose 300 pounds.  She writes me every day with insults.  It's like, stop already.  Just be a human being.  What does Lady Truck say?  She just abuses herself and everyone around her.  We get it.  I see these things.  She goes like...  You're comfortable with your fatness.  Capital letters.  Like, Anthony, look at this.  And I click on the link because I'm an idiot.  And it's some big fat bitch on all fours.  And what was...  Doggy style. 
[01:29:00]  Learn a minute.  What was the picture...  Learn a minute.  You vampires.  What was the picture I saw on your Twitter?  It was like a pillowcase.  Was it cum stains on it?  That was at your show, Albee.  What?  That was at the show.  That was at the...  Oh!  All right.  I got confused because I was looking at this pillow with massive cum stains on it.  I thought it was your pillow from your truck.  Oh, that was when you came in and saw us.  Yes.  Okay.  I was confused.  All right.  Lady Trucker.  What do you got, Lady Trucker?  Oh, I was just calling today to let you know that Oprah's buying KFC for everybody. 
[01:29:30]  Go to Oprah.com slash KFC until 10 o'clock tonight.  She's buying a two-piece chicken dinner for everybody.  What do you mean everybody?  Why?  Because of the Rochester story?  I have no idea.  You mean anybody that goes to that site can, like what, download something, print it out,  and take it to a KFC?  She's buying KFC dinners for everybody.  But why?  What's the back...  But why?  Because she's always trying to help people, even though it's more about the sponsorship  with KFC.  Yeah, of course.  Why talk about that part of it?  So why is she buying chicken for everybody? 
[01:30:00]  What's the reason?  Buy that chicken.  Buy that chicken.  But the back story, there's something there.  Is it because Rochester ran out of chicken?  We did that story.  Oh, but that was Popeye's.  It looks like KFC is introducing some new, quote, healthy grilled chicken.  Oh, right.  I think it's just publicity.  No.  Yes, they're doing like a baked chicken thing.  Oh, that's probably good.  So it's not fried at chicken.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Lady Trucker. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Fried at chicken.  You hear me?  Fried at chicken.  Fried at chicken.  Up next, Patrice O'Neal, everyone.  Fried at chicken.  Fried at chicken.  Fried at chicken.  You hear me?  Everybody want to do some hot chicken.  Sunday fried chicken.  It's a little bit.  Who's here?  Everybody want to do some hot chicken.  Sunday fried chicken.  It's a little bit.  Who's here?  Everybody want to do some hot chicken.  Sunday fried chicken. 
[01:31:00]  It's a little bit.  Yeah.  Everybody want to do some hot chicken.  Sunday fried chicken.  It's a little bit.  Man, we just did 20 minutes with Patrice.  That should have been on the air.  I hate this.  That's why maybe we've got to keep you guys outside the door until we go live.  He's talking about Facebook and Twitter and being on the grid and being off the grid.  It's my first time here at the wonderful new compound, man.  How are you guys doing?  Oh, jeez.  It's wonderful, isn't it?  Well, you know. 
[01:31:30]  They don't really understand.  It hurts.  It hurts.  Thank you.  It's the trickle down theory.  Because when I say it, they're like, oh, you know, he's not grateful.  Well, you know, come on.  You're not grateful?  Yeah.  For hotel wallpaper and a wooden plank as crown molding, they're disguised.  That's the place that my mother beat me with.  But they would argue they did the right thing and they built us a nice studio over here.  Here's what they did.  They brought your old TVs over and put them on the wallpaper and then put an Opie and Anthony sign up. 
[01:32:00]  And now this should be reserved for an old school newsman.  Yeah.  This is not right.  This is not right for fun and frolics and friendship and comfort and happy.  No room for shenanigans.  Every second of your fucking talking is going to be resentment.  Yeah.  Like even when you're having fun, you go, you know what?  Why am I having fun?  It just reminds me of like when I went to jail when I was younger, they sentenced me in January to go to jail. 
[01:32:30]  In June.  So June 3rd, I'm just like kind of forgetting.  I mean, January 3rd.  Yeah, yeah.  Then come like February 2nd, I'm like happening.  I'm laughing with a friend.  And then I go, something's wrong with my life.  Why am I not?  Oh, I'm going to jail.  I'm going to jail.  Why do they do that?  It taints everything.  So they're just waiting for a bed to open up.  It extends the punishment.  So we have a good run like the chicken run y'all just had last break. 
[01:33:00]  You know, good chicken run.  And then you just look at something that looks like a chicken stain on the thing and go, yeah, I forgot there's a chicken.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Did they ever give you a reason why they did that?  Because they knew they were wrong.  They were waiting until the nigger left school and sent him to jail in the summer.  Yeah, they wait for, I think they wait for a room to clear.  Yeah.  They just was being, they just was sending me because they knew it was wrong with summertime. 
[01:33:30]  It does prolong the agony, huh?  Like, you know, summer is for love and you'll remember that.  Summer's a time of season of change.  Great.  Thanks.  Change your honor.  Give me a felony conviction for that, you fucking cocksucker.  Now I got to, when I go to Canada, I got to get a boot in my ass and maybe a taser.  What are you doing here in our country?  Really?  You're a felon.  Fuck yourself.  Fuck it.  I don't need to be here.  What, every time you go over the border because of your past?  It's worse. 
[01:34:00]  It's worse with U.S. Customs.  And they always like, you always have to go into the room and shit?  I always have to go into the room.  Oh, mother.  And then they give me the thing where they, like, Canada tries to be gangster now, really.  Here's a big thing I don't worry about, by the way.  I have some.  Are you pulling out a gun?  I'd like to.  Put you motherfuckers out your misery.  If I won't kill myself, that's the only difference.  You're pretty much sitting on Norton's lap.  Just want that to be hurt out there.  It's just, I got one of these. 
[01:34:30]  What do you got?  Where it's a, it's a, a.  Oh, clear fly.  This is, this is the fucking, no, not clarify, motherfucker.  This is RFID chipped.  It's only for ground travel between Canada, Mexico, and the United States.  They are destroying the borders.  It's borderless.  Passport card.  It's the North American Union.  The dollar will be gone soon.  It's going to be the Amero without fucking, I pulled that out at the airport. 
[01:35:00]  They gathered around all the Ethiopians and Spanish people and fucking one white person  that was running them.  And they all went, ooh.  What does this do?  What is it?  It's to drive, which no one fucking does, through Mexico, United States, and Canada.  What about a passport, though?  Why not just have a passport?  Because they're going, it's to control transportation.  And that is the only way you're going to be able to travel through, driving through to 
[01:35:30]  Mexico, you're going to have to have that, and Canada, because it's going to be one big  giant.  It's what they do in Europe.  This is not a passport.  This is not good for flying.  No.  So you have, you need this, and your passport, and your license?  You need that as ground movement throughout North America.  Your passport is to go to other countries.  I have never heard of that.  Because I got a new passport.  But you can't fly to Canada.  No.  When you get a passport, they give you that?  No?  Well, you have the choice, but it's not really a choice.  And.  It's not really a choice. 
[01:36:00]  Protective, this, the sleeve that you have it in?  Yeah.  It's aluminum foil, and you have to keep it in there as law.  Because.  What?  Because the RF, the fucking tracking you chip, needs to be in there, or it can get  fucked up with all your credit cards and all that other shit.  Holy mother of pearl.  I'm serious, man.  It's fucking crazy out there.  You just freaked me out.  Travis is getting one of those.  What?  This is getting me.  Travis is getting one of those.  Yeah.  Well, because he goes to Canada a lot.  Yeah, this is Travis. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, pretty much what Patrice has is, like, let's say there's ten lanes at the border.  Okay.  There's one lane for the car that Patrice has.  It's like an easy pass.  That's exactly what it is.  That's what they tap this, motherfucker.  It always goes to white guys who don't give a fuck.  It's convenient.  It sounds convenient, Patrice.  It's not convenient.  It's an RFID chip in it, motherfucker.  It's to track you.  You think it's in your easy pass?  Yeah, they have the same thing.  Exactly.  That's why I don't have one.  The easy pass.  What are you fucking...  No one wants to track us.  Don Corleone?  No, but it's...  The easy pass is easy. 
[01:37:00]  It's if they want to track you.  I love the easy pass.  They don't call it a difficult pass.  Did you see this little girl?  Not a hassle pass.  The little girl that's missing.  This new white girl that's missing?  Yeah, yeah.  We're all petrified and scared for her.  They keep showing her on her last moments, but they keep circling people who are near  her.  You know how many times I've been fucking near some white girl that could be missing  later, but I was just old, strolling, big old nigga, strolling by?  But that's how they use...  They use this shit to put you in jail. 
[01:37:30]  No, they're looking to catch people like that.  But you're a guy who, if you were near someone in a video where they tracked you, you didn't  do anything wrong.  There'd be no DNA connection.  There'd be no evidence.  If they questioned you, you would go, yeah, I was walking here.  You'd be exonerated.  Dude.  The more DNA...  People are not convicted falsely with DNA.  It's actually exonerating people.  And that type of technology is normally exonerating people.  Barry Sheck runs a whole company now that just does that.  He gets DNA and gets people out of fucking prison through DNA. 
[01:38:00]  Yes.  The eyewitness shit is the stuff that fucks you up.  But computer chip stuff, they can prove, well, he wasn't there.  He's got his chip.  It says he was in another state.  He wasn't there.  And people are saying that's just for the daily commuters that go back and forth between  America and Mexico or America and Canada.  It's for the daily commuters.  There is no daily commute.  It's there.  It's there.  Have you seen her yet?  I thought Dom DeLuise died.  It's Jabba the Hutt.  She looks like Jabba.  A face transplant lady.  Why the fuck is her head twice as big as it should be? 
[01:38:30]  She looks like one of those where the wild things are, people.  She was shot in the face with a shotgun.  This ain't the same technology as Face Off.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah, the movies made it look so nice.  Yeah, you put John Travolta's face on, you look like John Travolta.  Just remove my face.  Yeah, that's all.  I'd rather than put the fucking William Shatner mask from Halloween just over my shotgun blast.  At least its proportion.  You know what?  You're right.  Are you fucking kidding me? 
[01:39:00]  Sometimes I wish I wasn't afraid.  You know that old saying, everybody want to go to heaven, but nobody want to die?  Yeah.  Sure.  I wish I just knew it was a heaven, and if something like that happened to me, I'd just  be like, I'm going to heaven anyway.  Check out.  I don't matter.  Please don't leave me with jowls, like seven different faces.  That bitch looks prehistoric.  And another thing, I'm going to have, I'm going to be cremated, because you're not going  to have me in some oil in the year 8,000 motherfuckers. 
[01:39:30]  You don't want to be fossil fuel?  800,000.  Nah, nigga.  You ain't putting me in nobody's gas tank, bitch.  Fossil fuel for trees.  And smoke me if you want to.  And you know what's fucked up?  Your whole existence might amount to one fucking piston push going down.  Just one.  Some cocksucker named Earl in the year 4 million is changing some spacely sprocketing with my 
[01:40:00]  ass.  Fuck you.  This ugly bitch could be oil, not me, as they find her face, right?  And they reconstructed it and say, this is what all of them look like.  Stop this shit.  Imagine that, yeah.  We reconstructed it, and this is what people look like back in the year 20.  A new creature that we found.  Jowl face.  And this is the male jowl face.  Big jowls hanging down on her shoulders. 
[01:40:30]  People were ugly in the past.  Oh, damn.  Nigga.  Oh, damn.  You can eat my ass, nigga.  Burn me to death.  Burn me, man.  Cook me.  Holy shit.  Cremate me.  You think she got rid of her Facebook page?  Oh, God.  She's got a huge face.  A lady got shot in the face with a shotgun, walks in the bar.  The bar's in the ghost.  Why the long face?  Why the giant face?  Why the jowls?  Big face, bitch. 
[01:41:00]  I can't stand how we have to give a fuck about somebody who gets from ugly to uglier.  Thank you.  She went from looking like she just chewed 12 lemons to looking like she just has them in  her mouth, like she looked like she was eating them before.  Now she looks like she has them stuffed in her mouth, you bulldog face, bitch.  Get out of here, punk face.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[01:41:30]  Get the picture.  Oh, my God.  That bitch.  Fucking Easter Island head, bitch.  Fuck out of here, man.  What?  I thought we did this story justice two hours ago, but you just blew us out of the water,  Patrice.  I'm still laughing at the middle picture saying it looks like she was sucking on lemons.  And then the next one is, get out of here. 
[01:42:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, my God, droopy dog.  I don't want to see her ever again.  But she's trying to say she's not a monster, Patrice.  I'm not a monster.  Oh.  She wants everyone to know she's not a monster.  What's the bitch that's singing this ugly?  She looks just like her.  Boyle.  Susan Boyle.  She looks like Susan Boyle.  They took her from looking like a decent woman to a fucking mess to Susan Boyle's sister.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  She's all mouth. 
[01:42:30]  You couldn't even come up with Easter Island head.  I know.  It really is.  Look at her fucking head.  Why didn't we get that one out there?  Look at that giant head.  Her head is a big pyramid.  Like, it's a giant twisted.  God damn.  But you know what?  It looks like a prehistoric arrowhead.  You ever see the stone arrowheads from Apocalypto?  You big Apocalypto.  That's a bitch.  Look at the Easter Island head.  Just stop.  Easter Island is exactly what she looks like.  Will you stop forcing me to fucking give a shit about shit like this? 
[01:43:00]  And you know what?  You can't just look at the face pictures that everyone's looking at on the internet.  You've got to see the full body because the head is gigantic on her body.  It looks like she's dislodged her jaw, swallowed a cinder block, and it's going down her neck.  I wish to God I had enough fucking balls to completely believe in the Bible, completely believe in heaven.  So if something happens like that, I could just say, they'd go, Patrice, what do you want us to do?  I'm just going to hurry. 
[01:43:30]  What?  For the fuck.  Carolee, lightning on fire, coming out the window, carolee, going in the water, in the ocean,  taking you to Australia, and find out where they have a lot of sharks, and throwing me in the fucking water in Australia,  and have them eaten.  Now I've got to cut my head off first, and have them eat my head.  I've got to go into the lobsters, the carnivorous lobsters, and fucking kill me. 
[01:44:00]  Holy shit.  I'm going to fucking heaven anyway.  Why would you leave me alive with this face?  I don't want this fucking face.  Can I give it back?  Can I fucking draw her a receipt for this fucking face?  You motherfuckers, this is what you did to me.  You gave me a pointed head and giant jaws as a fucking finger?  Fucking fuck like dick.  What'd you say, McChief?  How'd I do it? 
[01:44:30]  How'd I look at this?  You have a receipt for this face?  I want a different place.  Niggas died all day.  Dick is shot in the chest.  I want a fucking regular face plant plant.  I heard a nigga die in jail yesterday.  I want a fucking good looking motherfucker too.  Holy shit.  It's like, don't any models die?  Don't give me this much of a fucking...  Didn't a fucking model die?  Yeah, but he was white. 
[01:45:00]  I don't give a fuck.  Look at how good looking this nigga is.  You gave me...  Who died with a pointy head that was...  That was comparable.  What'd you say?  Compartible.  I got a fucking headache.  Are you fucking serious?  Stop fucking forcing me to...  She looks like a howitzer shell.  What is wrong with a fucking...  She looks like artillery.  You fucking... 
[01:45:30]  You look like somebody loads her head.  Oh shit.  Oh my god damn.  Mommy, there's a pet dispenser coming.  Ow!  Oh my fuck, are you serious?  People want to...  Did you say carnivorous lobsters?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because they got it out there.  Chris goes, did he say carnivorous lobsters?  Carnivorous...  Tell my face to the carnivorous lobsters.  Feed my head to those...  Those tough carnivorous lobsters in Australia. 
[01:46:00]  Save the transplant insurance money.  Holy shit.  Oh, they picked up on carnivorous lobsters.  Oh man.  Carnivorous lobsters.  They'll fucking get eaten with Boyce and Bailey and his girlfriend.  Mother.  Oh.  Oh my god.  Fucking Alan Shepard should be in that head going around the earth.  It's just old mercury capsule head.  It's why I do that.  I don't...  The news.  Why do you force me to give a fuck about... 
[01:46:30]  I don't give a fuck about that shit.  I'm with you.  I barely give a shit about the people around me.  Don't fucking force me to...  Why am I going to give a shit about a stranger that had a unfortunate thing about it?  Yeah, dude.  Shit happens, motherfucker.  Shit happens, man.  Wow.  You got that one right in.  Oh, damn, man.  It makes her hair bad.  That's a great shot.  It's the hair.  You know what, though?  It's the thin hair on the top of her head.  It's a thin wig.  Yeah, yeah.  She needs more hair.  She looks like the doll from Trilogy of Terror.  I remember that motherfucker.  With a knife. 
[01:47:00]  Are you fucking serious, dude?  Like, if I could fucking...  Trilogy of Terror doll.  Punch out Trilogy of Terror doll.  Fucking come up with that reference.  Holy shit.  That is one of the fucking best old movies.  I don't know that one.  I remember being a kid watching that and just being petrified.  You don't remember Trilogy with Karen Black?  Oh, yeah.  I don't think I saw it.  I never saw that.  Dude.  There it is.  Wow.  I saw Karen Black on a plane once.  She still looked pretty good.  I would fuck Karen Black just... 
[01:47:30]  She still looked...  To say that you fucked Karen Black.  She's that ugly, gorgeous.  She's kind of like Carly Simon.  There's something about her that's just...  Old steam shovel jaw.  Yeah, just something about...  Oh, this girl's...  We might have the best reference of the day.  Dave in South Carolina might have it.  We've been taking these calls all morning long.  I say Easter Island head is fucking...  That hits it.  All right.  Dave in South Carolina.  Hey, car.  Oh, underside of a stingray head.  All right.  It does kind of look like it. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, shit.  From a shark's point of view.  A shark's point of view head.  Stingray shark head.  That's not bad.  Oh, God.  How about...  Wait a minute.  How about the tip top of a squid's head?  She's Calamari.  I can't tell him.  Are you going to get inside?  The Grimmets.  Oh, she got it.  Her sense of humor better be a cute man.  Oh, hell yeah.  She's going to have to deal with it.  She's going to have a lot of phony people around.  Oh, yeah.  Who are like, oh, my God.  I'm glad you're alive. 
[01:48:30]  Thank God, because you know something?  It looks fantastic.  You can't even tell anything happened.  Oh, really?  Then she put, like, blue hair on her and then let Buzz Bunny try to fucking...  Monsters are such interesting people.  Oh, my God.  I was just saying, I'm going to put some curlers in your hair and I'll be right back.  Oh, shit.  Monsters are such interesting people.  Interesting people.  There she is.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, shit.  Okay, Doc.  How the fuck did you find that, Danny?  Danny is the king of the search engine.  I don't even know the name of that monster.  Gossamer.  Gossamer.  Gossamer.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Man, look, man.  I'm telling you this new...  I can't...  I had to stop for this whole fucking world thing, this globalization, because it just makes  you upset every second of the day.  Absolutely.  I don't just like this fucking bitch.  Where you at with the swine flu? 
[01:49:30]  There's a little pushback.  The media is getting a little shit that they, you know, pumped up the swine flu thing.  Yeah, but you got to be into that shit, though.  We got our first gas, but...  You got to be into that whole bullshit, the conspiracy world.  Yeah.  To look at the swine flu and go, oh, here we go with the bullshit.  Yeah, I'm a little suspicious about this one.  Because it's inoculations and vaccinations.  It's control.  But I was watching this thing about Sun Tzu.  One of the things they were talking about, the Tet Offensive.  It was interesting.  Tet Offensive.  Why it failed, because it was a genius plan, but why it failed is a thing called moral 
[01:50:00]  influence, where you need the people to support the fucked up shit you do.  And that's the thing about these things.  You've got to do fucked up shit.  People have to go, yeah, get the Mexicans.  We have to control.  Now we have to control the borders, and we have to control vaccinated.  It's all for real.  But it gets where you go, all right, cuckoo.  But I just go, fuck it.  I just don't even say nothing no more.  Every little piece adds up, though.  It adds up.  My thing is, why the fuck aren't we mad at the fact that our money is not... 
[01:50:30]  Fuck everything else.  9-11.  We have no factual wealth.  There's no wealth.  Gold standard's gone.  They're just printing money.  So we really have no fucking money.  That's what kills me, dude.  It's a note that gets you goods and services.  What money is, originally, is a receipt for the money, for your wealth. 
[01:51:00]  That you have.  That you have.  Your wealth.  But if you want to cash in your receipt, there's nothing to cash it in.  You could get a car.  That's what I'm saying.  Goods and services.  Barter.  We've got to go back to the barter system.  I'm going to buy a lot of toasters and a lot of blenders.  And trade them with people with bread and eggs.  Toasters and plants.  I'm telling you, man.  Fuck all this, man.  Because if you've got a million dollars in the bank, basically, they'll just print 20  billion more dollars. 
[01:51:30]  And now you don't have shit.  And now you have nothing in the bank.  They could just control it.  There's nothing you could do.  You could take it all out and put it under your mattress.  It doesn't matter.  It can't go nowhere.  You just...  Hey, I'm a millionaire.  But bread costs $987,000.  Yeah.  Here's your change, motherfucker.  Now you're fucking...  You ain't got shit.  That is scary when you think of that stuff.  And then what that does, though, it cancels out all the arguments about who shot JFK and  who believes this.  The fact is, we are fucked because we have no money. 
[01:52:00]  It's just paper.  It's monopoly money.  And it scares the shit.  It should scare everybody.  But no one gives a fuck.  It does.  You got to just keep...  And stop drinking aspartame.  Don't drink aspartame.  You don't fuck with Diet Coke in here, right?  Oh, fuck it.  I do.  I love it.  What's that about?  Leave it alone.  Aspartame is absolutely, factually poison.  They've been trying to get it fucking...  I'm so sorry about this.  I love Diet Coke.  No, I like this.  How about Diet Pepsi?  I don't drink any of that shit.  No, aspartame, anything... 
[01:52:30]  Searle is a company.  S-E-A-R-L-E is a company that tried to get aspartame, I think, since 1961.  To be passed.  FDA is like, wait a minute.  This shit causes brain cancer.  Mice are five times...  We're five times more susceptible to cancer than mice.  And 20 times more susceptible to cancer than monkeys.  They both get brain cancer when they give them aspartame.  Now, they wouldn't fucking pass the law. 
[01:53:00]  The FDA is like, we can't do this.  This is...  A whole pudding-headed monkey.  This is a passport thing.  Exactly.  Listen to Beatles records.  Yeah, just a big tumor head monkey and some rats with tumors, just whatever.  And then, I think in the early 80s, I think 80 or 81, guess who was the president of Searle?  Who?  Donald Rumsfeld.  He gets in the office.  Daddy Bush puts him in.  And they pass fucking aspartame and NutraSweet and fucking Sweet and Low. 
[01:53:30]  That sounds like a conflict of interest.  Dude.  And he fucking fires the FDA guy that's in then and puts his own guy in.  And guess what?  Is now delicious.  Now, here's what they say.  This is...  Here's the conspiracy shit that sounds fucked up.  If you put Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi in heat...  I mean, this is a fact.  If you put it in heat past 80 degrees, the aspartame breaks down inside that liquid into formaldehyde. 
[01:54:00]  It turns into complete poison.  You're shitting me.  No bullshit.  That's why they say the first...  And this is just rumor that the first Gulf War, the Gulf War syndrome, was from Diet Coke.  Overheating?  In the heat, 140 degree heat, that the soldiers would drink.  And they would fuck their shit up.  That's what they say.  If somebody calls and tells me to suck my dick, I'll go, yeah, I'll suck it.  It's sounding very conspiracy-esque there, Patrice, to be honest with you. 
[01:54:30]  But see, that's what I'm saying.  It's like, that's why I'm only going with the bank.  Something that blatant.  That's why I'm going with the bank.  The fact is...  You can get all this information at pepsi.com.  You know?  And that's the thing.  And of course, I'm just saying, I don't want to get sued for...  This is what I hear.  This is the things I see.  Patrice, hold on a second.  If this is a real problem, why isn't more people diagnosed with brain cancer?  Why isn't it in the day?  They are.  When do you get your fucking brain cancer information in the morning?  But everyone drinks the diet soda.  They say pilots are having something called... 
[01:55:00]  There should be brain cancer all over the fucking place.  It should take years.  Pilots, I think...  And this could be, again...  I'm just asking.  Pilots, I don't think, are allowed to drink Diet Coke before they fly.  Because they were having what they call grand mal seizures.  And they were having seizures in the planes.  I say we put some Diet Coke in the microwave.  Oh, shit.  Heat that shit up and let David drink it and see if he fucking freaks out.  Oh, I hear them screaming out there going, do it!  What would manage...  Oh, wow.  You like that? 
[01:55:30]  I do.  I think about it every time we think of doing any type of bit with anybody.  What's...  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, wow.  Oh, good gravy.  Oh, good gravy.  Oh!  Good gosh.  I don't even know where it is.  Okay, what's the bit at?  Well, I say we take some Diet Coke with the aspartame in it.  Yeah.  And we put it in the microwave, heat it up really, really hot, and if this breakdown happens,  then we have David drink it and see what happens to his brain. 
[01:56:00]  What would management say?  Oh, I didn't think of that.  Yeah, you're right.  Fuck it.  Oh, to answer your question, not everybody who smokes cigarettes gets lung cancer, by the way.  Yeah, that's true.  So, I mean...  I'm just asking for the...  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Yeah, so I don't know.  You know what I mean?  So I'm just trying to save my friends.  That diet soda isn't good.  What can we drink that's yummy, though?  I like a yummy drink.  I know.  I hate water.  Water makes my stomach hurt.  Now, doesn't some diet soda have other stuff in it? 
[01:56:30]  Like saccharin, for years they were saying it causes cancer.  I think saccharin, not saccharin, there was another poison, something.  What was in the first diet?  In tab.  It's illegal.  And every single one of these things, right?  What's in NutraSweet?  NutraSweet is aspartame.  Yeah?  Aspartame and sweet and low is the same product.  Sweet and low was what used to be saccharin.  No, no, no.  NutraSweet?  NutraSweet and Splenda.  Splenda, right, right, right.  Sweet and low is saccharin, which is illegal in Europe. 
[01:57:00]  Is Splenda good?  Splenda's the same thing.  Splenda's aspartame and phenylene.  I do a little Splenda.  Yeah, don't leave it.  It's poison.  I'm out.  Can't they come up with something sweet that doesn't...  I know!  And it's always...  Wait a minute.  They did.  It's always from cancer experiments.  Like, they're trying to find a cure.  It's like, that's tasty.  A tuft of hair.  Yes.  Instead of your coffee.  They always come trying to find a cure for cancer.  You want to take a...  And they came up with these fucking...  And they come up with...  And the guy goes, wait a minute.  This could kill... 
[01:57:30]  But this motherfucking shit is a hundred times sweeter than sugar.  MSG used to be in baby food from World War II.  Yeah, yeah.  When they used to get...  The motherfuckers went to Japan and got all the Japanese rations and was tasting it like,  this shit is delicious.  And they went and found out the shit...  They was trying to find a cure for some kind of disease, some shitty cancer.  All right, all right.  Listen, Patrice, we got to go to Snopes.  But wait, who is putting...  People are saying go to Snopes.  Uh-oh.  On the Aspartame.  Who's tasting cancer research stuff? 
[01:58:00]  Like, how do you know it's...  Like, who's got, like, cancer blood to go?  I got to give it a sip.  It looks sweet.  It looks delicious.  Is Snopes saying fuck me or Snopes is with me?  And then we got a guy on the phone, John.  He goes, I hate Patrice.  How could you hate Patrice after that fucking face transplant shit he just did?  Shut up.  Let's talk to John.  Let's see.  How could you hate someone?  His name is John Aspartame.  It's his uncle's company.  John, how could you hate Patrice after...  Ted Aspartame.  That's my boy Ted Aspartame.  It's very good for you.  It makes your head bigger for your head spin. 
[01:58:30]  John, how could you hate Patrice after...  Pack of lies.  How could you hate Patrice after he gave us, like, 20 solid minutes on that face transplant monster?  No, I think Patrice is a funny stand-up.  But the problem is, whenever he's on the show, he just, like, takes over your show, man, and  he talks over it.  Divide and conquer.  There you go.  No.  He's being very funny.  We're in a room full of childish people like that, dude.  We're completely getting our points across, and we're having a discussion here.  Patrice, I... 
[01:59:00]  They know what they get when they have me in.  I'm loud, and I like to laugh, and then it happens.  When your friend is on fire, and he's being funny, you just...  It's not like we're all trying to talk, and he's not letting us.  He's being funny, so we're laughing.  That's what you do when someone's being funny.  I believe we have to justify it to this idiot.  Ted, Fred, per tame is a dick.  Yes, he is.  You want to take a phone call from someone who thinks you're an idiot?  Yeah, fuck it.  All right.  I'm on.  Tyler.  You're on the line.  He's a pilot, actually.  Well, okay.  Let's see.  And again, can I please say that I'm only saying I believe it, but what he's going to 
[01:59:30]  say, he's a pilot.  He's in on it.  Like, again, not everybody's going to have a fucking seizure, but someone did.  Someone had his...  Pilots had a seizure, and they found out because he drank Diet Coke.  That's why he got two guys in the cockpit.  Yeah, there you go, just in case a cocksucker has a seizure.  Tyler, you got Patrice.  Yeah, I'm an airline pilot.  Welcome aboard.  On any soda that we can drink, they don't care.  You can drink any soda you want.  Where are you coming up with this graphic? 
[02:00:00]  Who you work for?  Fucking Alaska Airlines or one of them propeller ones?  The ones that...  Yeah, the ones that fucking pigeons.  Which one?  Propeller.  The jet, don't worry about it.  Which one?  Propeller.  Do you understand?  Do you see what he did?  He fucking told me I'm a cocksucker.  I put myself out there.  Then you call and say you're a pilot.  You know what?  I'm an astronaut, fuckface.  Who do I fly for?  Asser.  What kind of plant?  Exactly, you fucking dick.  Here's Maureen, who agrees with Patrice.  Listen to this one.  Maureen.  Mo, how are you? 
[02:00:30]  Hi.  That acetone that's in the splendor and the sweet and low and all those fake sugars that  are out there, they are great for killing insects in the summer because we used to have  an ant problem in the backyard.  You put that stuff down, it's sweet, they take it, go back to the nest with it, and it  kills all of them.  Ant problem.  That stuff is poisonous.  Somebody who's in the backyard fucking your teenage daughters? 
[02:01:00]  It is what it is.  But the fact is, here's one of the things, and this is, and oh, Jimmy, this is one thing,  I'll be blown away with all the people that go fuck yourself with conspiracy theory.  What I'm saying is, the fact is, Donald Rumsfeld, okay, was the president of the company that  couldn't get a product passed for 20 years, and when he got in there, he dumped off the  people that said no for 20 years and got it approved.  I'm saying, does that not sound, that just sounds like coincidence. 
[02:01:30]  I just don't, it doesn't mean nothing, I guess.  Fuck it.  We got to ride the phones a little bit because people are sort of backing you up, but you  got Dano in Kentucky.  Dano, what do you got on this Patrice thing?  Fuck him!  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Boo.  Hey, we had a young buck sergeant in my company when I was stationed at Fort Hood, and he came  when he came back from the Gulf War a couple years after.  His hair was falling out in clumps, man, and he looked like he just escaped from Dachau. 
[02:02:00]  And this guy was huge when he went over to the sandbox the first time, and you know,  he just deteriorated, man.  I mean, he literally looked like he had Mickey Mouse on the side of his head.  So what...  Yeah, it was horrible.  I mean, it's just like a...  All right, we get that it was horrible.  What was he diagnosed as having?  They had no idea.  AIDS.  God forbid it be Gulf War Syndrome, because there's no such thing as that.  Yeah, something happened to the boys, though.  That's obvious.  They wasn't spraying Agent Orange over there and all that shit. 
[02:02:30]  No, there's no foliage over there, man.  Yes, you don't have to have foliage.  Oh, my God.  We don't mean to laugh, but the face transplant.  I can't stop.  Ladies back on TV.  Looking at us.  I'm going to tell you who she looks like.  Yeah.  Madam.  Listen out.  Thank you, man.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Whale and Flowers and Madam the puppet.  Oh, my God.  Madam.  Oh, she is.  She is.  She looks like Jabba more than, look, probably Jabba the Hutt and the shape of her fucking face. 
[02:03:00]  A little Jabba going on.  Let's go to Lonnie in North Carolina.  Lonnie.  Hey, Patrice.  Yeah?  Hey, there's a chemical that they put in Mountain Dew.  I can't remember the name of it, but it's the same chemical that they put in Antifreeze,  and if you drink Antifreeze, what will it do?  It will kill you.  I'm just saying, look, the thing is, you get too much into this, like, where it goes  back. 
[02:03:30]  It's just there's certain fucking facts that exist that you go, wait a minute.  All right.  You can't lie about the fact that aspartame couldn't get approved for 20 years and then  finally did when Mr. Rumsfeld got in office.  Now, I'm not saying he got nothing to do with it, but the FDA wouldn't put this fucking  product out.  Now, Snopes, though, is coming up with a lot of falses on these, Patrice.  What are they saying?  A lot of falses.  Fair enough.  That's the go-to site, too, Patrice.  They could be in on it.  Now, Donald Rumsfeld was the president of the company of Snopes. 
[02:04:00]  He was the president of the company that finally got what's known to be a poison chemical approved  for consumption.  He truly was, yeah.  That's it.  All right.  I mean, you know, Snopes can tell me to go fuck myself.  I don't know that.  He's got a pinky.  He has his big toe.  What does Snopes have?  Oh, they took his big toe off.  What is this story?  Oh, no.  And put it on his hand because he lost his thumb.  So now he's got his big toe on his thumb. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  His stupid thumb's always going to market.  What's going on with the news today?  Oh, God.  I think doctors are just getting bored.  And then, I guess.  He said, I'm going to get you, sucker, too.  Look, they just took a big toe.  I'm going to get you, sucker.  Took the big toe off, made it into his thumb.  It looks pretty much like he has a better thumb than mine.  Does it smell?  Huh?  You think it stinks?  It probably has the same callus under it.  Oh.  A little padding, toe padding. 
[02:05:00]  A corn.  He gets a corn on his thumb.  What the fuck's going on with the news today?  It's just horrid.  Something else is happening.  Why do we need to know about toes?  And fucking face lady and everything.  And face lady.  What's going on?  It's just becoming swine flu.  It really is.  Distractions.  Porn star for Senate.  Who is this porn star?  Thank you, Obi.  There's all kinds of stories coming up.  I'm a fan of the distraction.  I really believe that things just happen to be on TV at the right time.  Got G20 summits and shit.  Major league distractions are going on right now.  Distractions.  As finances are crumbling. 
[02:05:30]  Fucking puppies sliding around.  Oh, I saw that.  Yeah, the puppy with no front leg.  It's just to make it go, oh, and the missing.  Girls every five minutes.  Like fucking Nancy Grace is the dead white baby network.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Do you have any other fucking news, you funky bitch?  Hulk Hogan said he wanted to kill his wife.  Is that news?  Who's this other one that's not Nancy Grace?  This other one with one eyebrow.  She looks.  She's like Frankenstein.  The one with the case lift? 
[02:06:00]  That's the one that they dutied up.  With the fucking.  No, they gussied her up.  One eyebrow that is inside of her eyes.  She looks like a lesbian to me, my personal opinion.  She got three names.  Rachel Maddow?  No.  She's on.  What the fuck is it?  She's on HLN.  It's Nancy Grace and her.  That's it.  Nancy Grace does dead babies.  What the fuck is he talking about?  And the other one does.  She does some dead baby.  Then she does Hulk Hogan wants to kill his wife.  Hmm.  Come on, man.  I don't know. 
[02:06:30]  Her name is something, something, something.  Travis is at the computer, so you're not going to get anything out of him.  No.  Yeah.  HLN.  Can you type in HLN real quick, please?  Travis is illiterate.  We got a doctor told me story.  Let's see what this is about.  We'll call Dr. Steve.  You didn't do the Snopes thing yet.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get Dr. Steve on.  Tom in Nebraska.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  How are you this morning?  Thanks, Tom.  Yeah.  I was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy because my legs went bad on me.  My arms went bad. 
[02:07:00]  Fucking.  Fucking.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  But the minute I stopped aspartame for a month, everything came back.  No way.  Because it's associated with a lot of neurological diseases.  Oh, shit.  And Patrice is absolutely right.  They call them excitotoxins.  Yeah.  Sounds exciting.  It does affect certain people, and it will ruin your muscular and neurosis. 
[02:07:30]  I got to be honest here.  Dr. Steve not backing up Patrice.  Well, get him on the phone.  No, he can't call.  He's doing something probably with a patient.  Oh, fuck the patient.  He said he's got his fingers in somebody, and she's going to wake up soon.  He said, I can't call in, but Patrice is full of shit on this one.  How about the muscular dystrophy guy who got better when he stopped drinking this shit?  Oh, he probably stopped doing other stuff, too.  Like, fucking.  And fuck him.  He probably moved away from a fucking nuclear reactor.  How can you ask any.  I'll tell you what he said.  Listen.  I know, but not fuck Dr. Steve.  We like Dr. Steve.  But he's a doctor. 
[02:08:00]  He's going to prescribe me something that has to do with aspartame.  No, here's what he said.  He said, aspartame is simply two amino acids, a very small protein, nothing poisonous about it.  I said, is Diet Coke going to kill me?  Hell no.  That's what he says, but there's other credible doctors who say different.  I believe them.  There was a truck driver that said that when they haul Coke and Diet Coke in the tractor trailers,  it's not refrigerated, and sometimes that temperature in the back of the trailer goes way the fuck up. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, and it's not, type in 80 degrees aspartame or 80 degrees Diet Coke.  It just, you can't store it past, I think on their website you can't store it past, up above 80 degrees.  Greta Van Susten.  One thing.  Van Susten.  Susten.  Van Susten.  They just had it.  Mitchell, something Mitchell.  No, wait, there's one thing you might be missing out.  Just because an ingredient, I'm not saying you're wrong, but because an ingredient's in antifreeze, 
[02:09:00]  every ingredient, if you break that antifreeze, might not be deadly.  Like, you know, H2O might be an antifreeze.  So just because they say it's an antifreeze, I don't know.  Fair enough.  That's a fair argument.  Do you know what would happen if you ate pure sodium?  You'd probably cum all over.  And if you ate chlorine, you'd also die.  Why are you eating like a kitten?  What the fuck is wrong with this bitch ass nigga, man?  Patrice, I put a little bit of weight on.  I'm trying to get...  Jimmy just...  Kenny just brought Jimmy in a can of bumblebee tuna. 
[02:09:30]  Why don't you go play with some fucking...  Some slippers or a ball instead of eating like a kitten.  Give Jimmy some yarn.  Exercise like when you...  Jimmy's gonna bat around some yarn.  Mouse face.  Just fucking hit your own head.  He brought him a giant can of fucking cat food.  He's gonna chase his hog later.  In a big jar of mayo.  I'm gonna take a laser light and make him chase it into the wall.  Is the mayo fattening?  No, it's fat free, of course. 
[02:10:00]  Is it fat free mayo?  Does that have aspartame in it?  It's got AIDS in it.  Don't eat it.  I'm sorry, man.  It's got AIDS in it.  Ultimately, eat aspartame or don't.  I'm just trying to save motherfuckers, man.  I hear a lot of people are saying...  Oh, what is that, Danny?  That says aspartame warning.  And it's bad for diabetics.  Because it makes the body think sugar is in it.  Even though...  Really?  Yeah.  Diabetics should fix their bodies and stop fucking...  I'm saying it's supposed to be... 
[02:10:30]  It fools your pancreas or some shit?  Yes.  It's supposed to be, oh, it's inside of you.  And, oh, this is not affecting you like sugar.  But it affects the mind so that it makes the body think there's sugar in it any goddamn way.  So just fucking say it over and over that this is not sugar.  This is not sugar.  All right, listen.  You're an asshole, you motherfucker.  Chemist.  Patrice is completely right.  That's Rick in New Hampshire.  Med student.  Chris in Missouri.  Patrice is just wrong.  Oh, good God.  What a bunch of opinions.  What to think?  I don't know.  Millions are allergic to aspartame. 
[02:11:00]  Tell Dr. Steve, this is from Phil in Ohio, that two chemicals break down into formaldehyde when mixed with stomach acid.  Well, this thing, whatever this is that I'm reading here says that when aspartame exceeds 86 degrees, it converts to formaldehyde.  Yeah, but this is just some dude writing something on the internet.  Right, right.  But if you, it'll come, it'll be more than just him.  Yeah, but it's going to be the same thing.  We're going to call it in the microwave.  I'll drink it right now.  There's nothing wrong.  I've had hot soda before.  It doesn't taste like formaldehyde. 
[02:11:30]  I love hot soda.  You might get a brain tumor.  Well, I don't, like, since we can't prove it, it must be true.  That's what I'm saying.  My thing is, it's like, every, it's going to always break down to that.  There's, there are things in there that you, okay, if you go, uh, fuck that, I'll drink the soda, right?  Okay, that's the thing where you go, okay, Danny, we, if we do this, you prove me wrong.  But there are, there are some facts there that just should, you should go, that bothers me, the fact that that that's a fact.  It gives you pause. 
[02:12:00]  Even though it may not lead to America brought down the towers itself, it's still, the fact is, income tax didn't exist until after 19th.  Patrice, do you eat microwave food?  Yes, it is.  All right.  I hate.  But you won't have, but you won't have a Diet Coke.  My thing is, if somebody says, give me, give me some information that don't eat microwave, I won't fucking, I won't do it.  Well, maybe there hasn't been enough research because microwaves have only been a consumer product for, you know, X amount of time.  Well, look at, okay, are you in agreement that cigarettes probably kill you? 
[02:12:30]  Of course.  There was a time where motherfuckers.  Nine out of ten doctors.  Now, the Marlboro man, the original Marlboro man looks like that lady.  Yeah, he's dead.  Before the transplant.  No mouth and all the whole thing.  Dead.  Now you, cigarettes, you have to say cigarettes are poison.  You have to.  Yeah.  There's poison, there's not even, it could be poison no more.  Use a cell phone?  It's poison.  Use a cell phone?  That's what I'm saying.  I believe that.  Brain tumor?  And if I fucking think about it enough, I'll try not to use a cell phone. 
[02:13:00]  Because that's what I'm saying.  Some people don't, and some people.  You're going to get finger cancer.  Well, that's what's the word above 80 degrees because it's protein breaks down and it loses its sweetness.  Oh.  Yeah, it breaks down and it separates.  I'm with Patrice.  We don't know what the fuck we're eating and drinking for sure.  Nothing.  And some of this shit will probably turn out to be as bad as cigarettes.  Oh, fudge.  Who knew there's something in peanuts that's zillion, everything has to be told.  You have to be told that this was made next door to Johnny's Peanut Factory. 
[02:13:30]  Because there's so many people that'll just fucking die from peanuts.  Just peanut dust.  We'll take you out.  I bought some watermelon made near Peanuts, a peanut facility.  How about this new announcement?  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.  We're not going to be able to serve peanuts on the aircraft because we have a peanut allergic passenger.  Well, fuck them.  Have a peanut free flight.  Exactly.  Peanuts are killing the fucking bathroom.  I haven't heard that announcement yet. 
[02:14:00]  How do you look at his own shit?  What do you use for tracers?  Exactly.  So tell him not to read the funny papers.  The funny papers.  We're going to break.  Patrice, what are you promoting?  I'm in Miami.  I'm at that Miami Improv this weekend.  Starting what?  Tomorrow?  Starting Friday.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  For everybody in the Miami area, go see Patrice O'Neill at the Miami Improv.  Come here, Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy's going to...  And I'm in comics in June for the people who live in New York.  Comics in June. 
[02:14:30]  We're going to let Jimmy eat like a kitten.  A kitten?  That is so fucking funny.  Chris Cornell was in yesterday.  Yes.  And he was talking about Trent Reznor.  And Jimmy got involved and the hilarity ensued.  Trent Reznor, who I don't know if you're friends with him or not.  I always thought he was kind of a chiz bucket.  That's just my take on him.  Wow.  I never really liked him.  Chiz bucket, huh?  That's just my take on him.  Fuck him.  I never liked him.  We get it.  You never liked Nine Inch Nails?  Never.  But he's shitting on your new thing. 
[02:15:00]  It's like, for what?  Yeah, I don't know.  I never met him.  Soundgarden was...  We were a fan of his, especially his video, but his video and had like a whole song.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very creepy.  I love that.  And we hired the same guys that did that video to do the Jesus Christ Pose video based on that.  And then, you know, that was kind of it for me as far as being a fan.  But I liked that.  I never met him.  I never read what he said about my Timbaland record. 
[02:15:30]  Making a record with Timbaland and me being me, I knew there was going to be people that  were going to talk shit.  That's like a script someone wrote for you.  Whatever.  He said something that's like on Twitter, which is like you can basically put one paragraph.  And so I added him so I can see what he says.  He doesn't like bring it up anymore.  I think he said one little thing and then it was sort of repeated over and over and over.  Sort of just like a mental kind of a, here, I'm just going to blurt this shit out and  then leave it alone. 
[02:16:00]  But what I do see is he does talk about Star Trek a lot.  Which is, you know, he's got opinions about a lot of stuff.  But he talks about Star Trek a lot.  Wow.  And that, I don't know what tale that tells, but it tells some kind of a tale.  Fucking nerd.  There's a, there is a group that talks about Star Trek and maybe he gets a little preoccupied  with it.  And in fact, the new, I see it on the cover of the magazine here.  Yeah.  The Star Trek movie is out.  He, there, he was talking to people about that.  I think everybody's happy about it. 
[02:16:30]  Five stars.  Five stars in the pan.  Yeah, in the pan.  You know, I don't like Trent Reznor because years ago I dated a girl named Liz who had  a thing for him.  And she goes, you know, he's bisexual.  And she said she masturbated thinking about me and him fucking.  I'm surprised, Jimmy.  And it always annoyed me from then.  And that was it.  They shouldn't broadcast these things over the public airwaves.  I can't believe there's even a debate about it.  The virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  202.  202.  202. 
[02:17:00]  Patrice O'Neill.  Miami Improv.  This weekend.  Hey, uh, intern David hates tuna fish.  We're going to have him come in here to do his Wolverine movie review.  Ah, yes.  You seen the Wolverine yet, Patrice?  You're a big movie guy.  I've seen it.  You saw it already.  You liked it?  Yeah.  It was as good as any of them.  It wasn't bad.  I like the X-Men movies.  It wasn't bad.  I thought Liev Shriver was really good.  Oh, who's that guy?  The one that plays his brother?  The Sabertooth. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  It was good.  It wasn't like you don't do backflips or nothing.  Yeah.  But it was certainly...  What do you think Star Trek looks like?  That shit looks amazing.  Doesn't that look great?  That looks fucking amazing.  Getting five stars.  Let's see that.  Opens tomorrow.  Dude, that...  I know.  And I'll tell you, they got Pelham.  I saw the original taking of Pelham.  One, two, three.  Oh, they were doing that movie, right?  They were doing it with Denzel and somebody else.  Why?  I don't know.  Why?  But I tell you, Robert Shaw was fucking great as that. 
[02:18:00]  I was going to say, most people alive today don't know that movie.  I've never heard of it.  I never even thought of that movie.  They don't know that movie.  And there's one coming out this month, I think the 24th that I might want to see.  Star Trek's the biggie and it's another one that's open.  Terminator's coming out, yeah.  Terminator, but keep going.  What's the...  Action or comedy?  I don't know.  Where are we at?  If you hear the name, I know I'll know it.  I think it's...  What's today's date?  We got the 6th.  The 6th.  So, not the 13th.  Matthew McConaughey.  I don't know. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  Matthew McConaughey and I'm a cunt.  What do we got there?  It must be the girlfriend experience.  No?  The girlfriend experience.  Dance flick?  Land of the Lost.  Land of the Lost?  No, no, no.  Angels and Demons.  I want to see that.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Oh, that Ron Howard movie?  Yep.  And Terminator looks like it's going to be good, too.  Yeah.  It's another one of those, you know, we don't give a shit what the fuck movie came out before. 
[02:19:00]  We're just redoing this.  Fuck you.  I like that attitude.  That's fucking Star Trek, man.  With the young everybody.  Young, brash Kirk and fucking, yeah.  And then there's no...  Doc McCoy.  I haven't seen a trailer for it.  They got two casting things that's going to be interesting.  The Asian guy from the Kumar, Harold and Kumar movies, is going to play Sulu.  And then the guy from the zombie movies, the...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's going to play Simon Pegg. 
[02:19:30]  He's going to play Scotty.  And that's going to be interesting.  Yeah.  That's going to be interesting.  Yeah.  But other than that, dude, that shit looks...  I could see that happening.  I could see him being Scotty, though.  That's kind of...  But he's always been funny, so I don't know.  If that movie's bad, I'll be sort of disappointed.  That's not going to be bad.  I remember...  You know something?  I remember this same fucking conversation taking place...  With what?  With Planet of the Apes.  Oh!  Saying, if this movie...  This looks so...  I was going...  It looks so good.  Remember, I had the movie poster hanging up over my desk...  You're so right.  ...for like months. 
[02:20:00]  And I'm going, I cannot wait to see this.  And I was like...  They could have been on their...  They could have been on their 10th movie by now.  That was a bad decision, wasn't it?  That was a bad movie.  That came on CW the other day.  And I was like, this movie is in obscurity...  Yeah.  Because it fucking stinks.  How did you wreck that?  But it wasn't getting five-star reviews either, though.  This is getting great reviews.  Oh, yeah.  This one's getting really good.  Yeah.  Star Trek just looks like...  Oh, it's getting good reviews?  It's getting five stars.  It's going to fucking destroy, too, at the box office. 
[02:20:30]  You know what, too?  A hundred percent.  How many people?  Yeah, this is probably 36.  A hundred percent.  36 ratings.  What?  36 ratings, not one bad review for Star Trek and Rotten Tomatoes yet.  Hey, let's connect.  Wow.  Can I say some fucked up shit, though?  Let's be...  Let's fucking be honest.  Yeah.  The people who review movies now are not credible like they used to be.  Cisco and Ebert were two dudes fucking doing fucking movies.  And you were waiting for that thumbs up.  And usually, it was legitimate.  But at the movie sissies, can you trust those two assholes? 
[02:21:00]  And these kind of nerdy, Trekkie fans?  Dude, they're Trekkie fans.  These are people that dress up as Spock who are doing movie interviews now about everybody.  They might be more critical than if they are, you know?  But not if it's nostalgic for them.  Wait a minute.  I got something to add to this whole discussion.  Hold on.  We're talking about Star Trek, J.J. Abrams, Cloverfield.  And I'm looking at a guy that hated Cloverfield.  Cloverfield, mate.  Matter of fact, I have an enemy in that meathead that had the camera in that movie just because 
[02:21:30]  I said that shit.  We was in Montreal and he's just looking at me like...  T.J. Miller, yeah.  He got drunk.  You're a fat fuck.  Fuck you.  He's a fat fuck.  Does he call me?  I go...  This is my movie, motherfucker.  It's okay.  Come here.  Give me a kiss, TJ.  Who was the movie reviewer that said to you...  Jeffrey Lyons.  Jeffrey Lyons.  No one asked you.  Because right at the end of the screening, Patrice was like, what did you say?  That stinks?  That stinks.  Or skip it or something.  I liked it.  Overfield.  I kind of liked it, too. 
[02:22:00]  I watched it two more times and it just didn't do what it should have did.  And I was critical of it because it bugged me because it could have did so much more.  So it is J.J. Abrams.  Evidently, he's a monster in terms of getting movies made.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I always wondered, how the fuck do you get the rights to make something another  Star Trek?  Yeah.  Like where you go, you know, I like this idea.  You know what?  I'm going to make Bridge Over the River Kwai again.  Just to do it. 
[02:22:30]  Do you know what kind of fucking shit you've got to do to do that?  I want those rights and how do I get that?  How do I get that?  I want to remake Jaws.  What?  Get that lady from the fucking...  You know, eventually they'll remake Jaws, though.  You know it'll happen.  That is who she looks like, the Jaws movie poster.  They will remake Jaws.  Oh, Robert Shaw.  In our lifetime. 
[02:23:00]  How do you recast fucking Robert Shaw in that movie?  I say you give it...  Let's recast Jaws right now.  Give it another ten years.  Ewan McGregor.  How do you say his name?  He'll be in it.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  Ewan McGregor.  I think you need someone a little more gruff.  A little gruff?  Yeah, a little more gruff.  Rachel Maddow.  All right.  How about Hugh Jackman?  Hugh Jackman.  That's not about enough of Hugh Jackman.  Enough of him.  What a silly name. 
[02:23:30]  Steve as a...  Yes.  How such a little wimpy guy plays such a fucking character like Wolverine and pulls it off?  A who guy?  He is a little wimpy fucking Broadway...  He looks like a beast to me.  I know.  He's a little fella.  But if you see him like...  Oh, he's a teeny little dude.  Oh, yeah.  And he's like a Broadway...  He hosted the fucking like Tony Awards and shit.  But the real Wolverine in the book is 5-1 or some shit. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, really?  Really?  I mean, but he's a teeny dude.  He's like a midget.  Danny?  I thought he was small, too.  I figured he was like 5'7", 8".  He's not.  He's actually almost 6'3".  6'3".  He's 6'3".  I'm surprised.  He looks like a beast.  We have no business doing a radio show.  Hugh Jackman is 6'3".  Don't look at me here.  Why don't you just call Hugh Jackman a midget?  And he's 6'3".  He's an inch and a half shorter than me.  He's a monster.  I don't feel bad about my Levon bit earlier now.  Hold the phone.  Wolverine is almost 5-something. 
[02:24:30]  In the books, Wolverine is like 5'3".  He's supposed to be a tiny little guy.  I thought he was small.  Hey, let's get Intern David in here for the Wolverine movie review, by the way.  Now that we're talking about it.  Now that I don't feel bad confusing Tiny Dancer, we can leave on.  I am stunned.  Yeah, we're fucking up all of it later.  Fuck it.  You just fucking took a foot off his head.  I was with you, though.  I was with Ed.  I thought he was a small guy, too.  He just took a foot off this doctor.  Intern David, everyone.  I chopped a foot off a Wolverine. 
[02:25:00]  David?  Did you crack your precious crackers?  Yeah, I just crushed them all.  Patrice just wanted some saltines.  Eat them anyway.  They're so good.  And Jimmy just smashed them.  What a prick.  What a prick.  I can't even do it.  No.  I can't even do it.  Crumbs.  Um.  Oh, bitch.  Hi, David.  Hello there.  How are you?  You don't like tuna fish?  I like tuna salad.  But I don't like tuna fish. 
[02:25:30]  Watery tuna fish.  Watery smelly tuna fish from a can I don't like.  Why?  What happened?  It just smells very...  It smells disgusting.  It's making me, like, nauseous.  Is it?  Yeah.  And I was all the way down the hole and I smelled it.  Yeah?  Are you sure it was then?  We have a tuna fish can and we could have them smell?  How about the filter?  Oh!  What?  He really hates that?  What's the big deal?  It smells really...  It smells disgusting.  No, no, no.  This one doesn't.  Oh, yes, it does.  It does.  It just smells really...  It's sick. 
[02:26:00]  Ooh.  You don't like it?  No.  No.  You don't eat gefilta?  Gefilta fish?  Yes, I do.  Isn't that awful?  Isn't that awful?  That's disgusting.  No, it doesn't smell bad at all.  No.  Doesn't that shit smell real bad?  Yes.  It does, right?  Terrible.  How about herring?  Eat herring?  I hate that.  I'm a Jew and I don't like herring.  Go figure.  You're Jewish?  I'm a Jew and I do not liking herring.  I didn't know that.  Go figure.  I don't like herring, no.  Oh, it looked like Sam was putting tuna on the pussy of the fucking rubber ass and pussy. 
[02:26:30]  No.  I'm holding that.  Hey, David, you bringing the ass and pussy home to fuck?  And give it a review?  And give it a review for Friday?  We want you to review.  You want to know if I can bring that home?  No?  He lives with his parents.  That could be a problem.  I don't know if I can bring that home.  Say it's a novelty yarmulke.  Wear it on your head.  I don't know if I can bring it home.  Yeah?  I don't think so.  All right.  David, what's up with the Wolverine movie review?  Yes.  You went and saw the movie?  Yes, I went and saw the movie for free. 
[02:27:00]  Ah.  For free.  Yes.  Yes.  This big catchphrase now is for free.  Yep.  We had a free movie screening.  Me and Sam, Iraq, intern Jill, and intern Matt.  Right.  And the movie is very, very good.  I enjoyed it.  You enjoyed Wolverine?  They gave it a one in the Daily News.  Yeah.  They did?  They got horrible reviews.  A fucking one.  And it made $87 million.  Yeah.  One weekend.  It doesn't matter if people wanted to see it.  Fuck the one star.  I enjoyed it because one of the reasons why I enjoyed it is because I'm a big Marvel fan 
[02:27:30]  and a big superhero fan, so that's why I liked it.  Oh.  You prefer DC Comics?  No, I prefer Marvel.  Is there really?  I don't like DC.  I mean, I'm dumb.  Is there really a difference between the two?  Yes.  What's the difference, really?  Marvel is just prolific, and they have a world.  DC has a, you know, they try to have a world, but it's really-  What's the big name of DC Comics?  DC is Batman and Superman.  Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman is coming out with one.  Yeah.  And then there's four biggies, and then it's just a bunch of side characters. 
[02:28:00]  Marvel have a lot of-  The four biggies is Wonder Woman, Batman, Superman, and Aquaman.  Okay.  Yeah, what about Flash?  And then the rest is like, man, I would say Flash is B, is a, they're B.  It's one A, and then there's one B.  I say The Flash, you couldn't do a whole movie on The Flash.  It doesn't, you don't even know who's The Flash's main enemy.  Like, you can name, you gotta name their main fucking enemy.  Molasses.  Molasses, man. 
[02:28:30]  It's a fucking, fucking Thumbtoe man.  Hunter Mills.  And, you know, DC is, it's just not, and we grew up on DC Comics, too.  Who does DC have?  But it's always cornier.  Superman and Batman.  Oh, they have them?  Okay.  But there's no, they have fucking Apache Chief.  Like, huh?  He's good, though.  He's good, but it's not, you know.  Look at Jimmy, he doesn't know.  DC has the Justice League, right? 
[02:29:00]  Why do you prefer DC, though?  It's so weird.  I don't prefer it, I just, I'm saying about it, I prefer Marvel.  Marvel.  Marvel.  Yeah, Marvel is much adult.  Right.  Adulter.  It's just more adult.  Alright.  What else you got on Wolverine?  So, I'm saying, if you don't, one of the things I have to say about it is, if you don't  like Marvel, you don't like superheroes, you're probably not gonna like the movie.  Oh.  And, another thing about this movie you should know, about 80% of the movie is just action,  action, special effect, my claws versus my long fingernails, blowing something up, big 
[02:29:30]  special effects, that's like 80% of the movie is that.  What's the other 20?  The other 20 is just like backstory and about relationship a little bit.  And then what's the other 10?  That's 20 and 80.  That's 100.  Stabbing.  Alright.  Yeah.  Wanted to check your math skills.  Last hour and a half, I'm gonna show you my powers.  So, what I'm gonna say is that if you're not a big fan of like the action, the hardcore  action, fighting, the bowling up, you're not gonna, you're not gonna like the movie. 
[02:30:00]  Hard, what kind?  Hardcore action.  You know, you're not gonna like the movie.  Hardcore action.  Even though the greatest superhero movie of all time, Batman Returns.  Yes.  Best.  Batman Returns.  Yes.  The Batman Returns.  No, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, Batman, sorry.  Yes.  Batman Begins.  That's right.  I knew what you were trying to say.  Batman Begins is the best Marvel movie ever made.  With Liam Neeson?  Yes.  I don't think so.  And it's over the original Superman, which used to be number one. 
[02:30:30]  Patrice, I'm so with you.  Loved the second Batman movie, but that first one was amazing.  I think The Dark Knight was better.  Amazing.  No way, man.  I enjoyed it more.  I'll tell you why the first one was better.  It stinks.  Because it added, it took away, if you're a big fan, it took away the suspension of disbelief  where they added that Morgan Freeman character, and everything had a reason.  Like, when you watch the old Batman TV show, you go, who built the bat car?  GM, nigga?  And who built the cave? 
[02:31:00]  Right, right.  Like, a construction company that is somewhere knowing that they built the bat cave, but  they're like, they're just proud of it quietly.  Like, yeah, we got the fucking thing.  Can you imagine the permits you'd have to get to build the bat cave?  Hey, listen, put that fucking computer decode over there, Jim.  Right.  And then it even explained why the villains wore costumes.  It, that movie was fucking amazing.  It was a great setup.  And then it pushed, it was so good, it pushed the original Superman into number two. 
[02:31:30]  I think I'm with you on this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You think it'd be hard to get a car that fucking has fire coming out the back when you're  going to get gas?  That's what I'm saying.  There's no reason for the fire.  You don't need it.  Oh, the idea that everything that Batman had was, was his own company for army, army  shit that no one bought.  Right.  It just was, right.  That fucking movie was amazing, dude.  And Liam Neeson, man, showing him how to fight with all that crap. 
[02:32:00]  The whole, the whole fucking movie was really good.  It just, there's nothing, I think the Dark Knight was great, but.  And they switched out the broads.  They switched out the broads.  What's her name?  Tom Cruise's wife.  Way better.  Katie Holmes.  Way better than.  I thought they were both bad, but Gillinghall, you just don't believe that major crime  lords and, and, and lawyers were fighting over that face.  Right.  It just bothered me, dude.  They were trying to make her be the sex pod. 
[02:32:30]  I think best, I think best hero girl in a movie, uh, is Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man.  Oh, Iron Man.  She, she did not fuck that movie up, man.  She was great.  You know something?  You bring up a very good point.  Yeah.  Think of movie women.  Margot Kidder was great, but here's another thing.  I'm not going to be too ugly for Superman to turn Earth backwards.  Right.  I'm not turning Earth backwards. 
[02:33:00]  I'm not going to fly through my father's imaginary face telling me not to do it.  To fucking help this bitch who died in a sand trap.  You should have.  You just simplified the movie perfectly.  You're so right.  That is exactly it.  For me and, and too ugly for Superman too.  What would you do?  Give up my powers?  Hold on.  Give up my powers.  Patrice, Patrice.  You're 10 porn stars.  You're Superman.  What would you do for, uh, Margot Kidder?  I would have tried to pull that car out if she wasn't living out of super blue sand. 
[02:33:30]  I would have tried to super suck the sand out of her fucking lungs.  All right.  If she didn't, if she didn't live then.  Super suck the sand.  That's as far as you would go.  I would have smashed her body into a diamond.  That's about as far as you would go.  And fucked it.  And fucked it.  And gave it to my new girl.  And then blamed Jimmy Olsen.  But to do that whole earth thing, fuck that, right?  Spin the, and then do that scream where I ignored my father saying, son, don't do this  shit.  Don't do this.  I told you. 
[02:34:00]  And to save that average looking, alcoholic looking bitch.  That's funny.  Nope.  The original Lois Lane that was on the train in the movie, the one that played the one  in the, oh, yeah, yeah.  The original, I'd have believed her more.  She was believable as a sort of sexy, sassy bitch back in the day.  What is wrong with you guys?  The original Lois Lane?  Yes.  From the TV show?  She was more sexy for George Reeves.  She was horrendous.  But they all were back then.  You just accepted that they were all horrendous?  Yeah, they were all, you know, they have that same stupid hairdo and the wacky hats. 
[02:34:30]  The I Love Lucy hat.  They're making another Iron Man, right?  Yes.  The Don Cheadle.  Fucking great.  That was, that may have been.  I like that better than the Batman movie.  That was good.  What's the top five?  What?  All time.  Superhero movies?  The Batman with Halle Berry, I think is the best one.  Catwoman, yeah.  No, the Catwoman was the worst.  Top five worst, top five best.  See, I didn't see enough of them, so. 
[02:35:00]  I've seen them all.  I'm kind of out.  Kind of out of myself.  Daredevil, horrors.  That was, that was terrible.  Ghost Rider.  Ghost Rider.  What about Hulk?  The Punisher remake was terrible.  The first one with Dolph Lundgren.  That was a great movie.  You didn't mind that.  I like that one.  It was the second one with Thomas Jane.  Thomas Jane.  But then they did another.  What is it with the Punisher?  There's a new Punisher coming out.  What is with the Punisher?  Where they won't stop making that shit.  Yeah.  The new Punisher, but the number one best is that Batman Begins.  It just hits you. 
[02:35:30]  It was solid.  Two is Superman.  Three is Superman 2.  Four is Iron Man.  Three is Superman 2.  And five is, I think, X-Men 2.  Wait, Superman 2 was, uh, which one now?  That was with Zod.  That was the one with Zod.  Zod.  Kneel before Zod.  Zod.  Okay.  Zod.  You didn't like the 3D Superman one they made?  With Richard Pryor?  Oh, man.  No, the one that was out a few years ago.  3D.  Oh, that new, the new one.  Superman Returns?  Yeah, Superman Returns.  Yeah, you had the 3D glasses. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, Superman Returns.  I had the fucking 3D glasses at the iMac experience.  Superman Returns is one of the worst ones.  What they did to that is terrible.  I wanted that kid, Rolf, who should have been in movies after that, but you haven't seen  him since.  Kevin Smith had a great review of that.  I was the only one that saw it with the 3D glasses?  He goes, in a Superman movie, I want to see Superman actually fight somebody and, like,  punch someone.  It was a lot of love.  Yeah, a lot of love and fucking...  All right.  We've got to get Greg Giraldo in here.  David, are you done with your dumb review? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  All right.  Pretty much.  All right, you're done.  Okay.  You're done.  Speaking of Wolverine, there was a little backstage thing that was happening.  Danny and Sam arguing about Wolverine.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and we were able to get a microphone into one of the Opie and  Anthony show staff's super secret prep meetings.  Things quickly got heated between Sam and Danny, who were discussing different show-related 
[02:37:00]  creative ideas.  The adamantium that Wolverine has is outside of his bones.  It's an exoskeleton.  No.  Because an exoskeleton is something that's...  It's protection that's outside your body.  So you'd wear your...  It's when you'd wear your skeleton as your skin.  What about the claws, then?  The claws are retractable.  I still define them as being part of an endoskeleton.  Why are you so stupid?  You're stupid!  I'm calling Big Kev!  Go, Big Kev!  With nothing left to do in the Great Wolverine debate, Danny and Sam decided to call ONA's 
[02:37:30]  resident geek culture expert, Big Kev, to help answer their questions.  Wolverine has an adamantium, you know, adamantium on the outside of his bones, right?  Yes.  Is that an exoskeleton or an endoskeleton?  I've always heard it referred to as an exoskeleton.  No!  Fuck that!  That is not true!  Big Kev is not outside his body.  Big Kev is the expert.  It's not outside his body.  I don't know which way to go on that.  All I'm saying is I've always heard it referred to as an exoskeleton. 
[02:38:00]  That is the correct answer, Big Kev.  No, I think Big Kev is saying that he's not quite sure the answer himself.  Big Kev...  I believe, believe it or not, as difficult as it is...  Obviously, the jury is still out on adamantium, but at least we hung up on Kev.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  Very good, Sam.  Now, we were going to go to break, but I noticed that intern David was very, very depressed, 
[02:38:30]  Anthony.  Extremely depressed.  No, I wasn't depressed.  We were in the middle of a Wolverine review from intern David.  I thought we had enough that we gave the people, and then we moved on to the backstage Danny  and Sam arguing about Wolverine.  And then intern David, very depressed because he didn't get to talk about the nude scene.  Oh, yes.  He didn't get to talk about that, but male nude scene, yes.  Oh, there's more male nudity than there was female nudity in the movie.  Was there female nudity?  Not really, no.  Very little.  But there was what? 
[02:39:00]  Male nudity.  What would management say?  But they'd be upset.  Yeah.  All right, what about the male nudity?  Yeah, give us the male nudity.  I just was going to say that I didn't really care for it too much.  There's one scene when it takes...  The movie takes place in the hill...  A lot of it in the hills of the Canadian Rockies.  And there's one part where Hugh Jackman is just running across the mountains naked.  And I didn't like that.  And there's also a lot of times when he's walking around with his shirt off.  So he's always bare-chested through a lot of the movie. 
[02:39:30]  Does Wolverine have a big cock?  You couldn't see it.  He was in the movie.  He was running out of anamantium.  Imagine an anamantium fuck.  Jesus Christ.  It's on hydrology.  You couldn't see it.  You can only fuck a bitch with superpowers.  You couldn't see his cock because it was a long shot, so you couldn't see it.  But how bad did you want to see his cock?  I wanted to see it.  But I couldn't.  I didn't.  Why did you want to see his cock?  No.  No.  No.  It was a joke. 
[02:40:00]  Whoa.  Come on.  Whoa.  Whoa.  No.  And I was also disappointed because there was a woman that played his love interest for a little bit.  But she was very, very underused in the movie, I think.  Yeah.  Her name was Lynn Collins.  I had never heard of her before, but...  Are you done now?  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  Yeah.  He's depressed, though.  You all right?  You all right?  Yeah.  That's all.  Yeah.  I'm done.  Sure.  I heard that we were trying to do the right thing.  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  I heard that we were...  And listen to this one, Ant.  This came about yesterday. 
[02:40:30]  We're trying to keep intern David on board, right?  Of course.  Why wouldn't we?  His internship ends in about a week.  Yeah.  And not this Friday, but the Friday after.  Which is about a week.  This Friday, it's up.  No, the Friday after.  Jimmy just bakes him.  He just doesn't.  Do it again.  Yeah.  Let's fucking just...  Yeah.  He's got...  So fries are the last day, so we should get a cake or something?  Yeah, yeah.  We got like four days left.  I mean, it's a shame.  Two days?  What days?  Three days. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, three days left in your internship?  No.  Friday.  It's not Friday.  What?  No, four days.  It's next Friday.  Yeah, next Friday.  That's four days.  No, no, no, no, no.  They think it's this Friday.  No, it's not this Friday.  It's next Friday.  Which is four days.  This Friday is four days.  You got it.  Wait, so a week from Friday is four days.  You have four...  You have four days left on your internship?  Correct.  Correct.  How is that possible?  It doesn't add up no matter how you look at it.  It's Friday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  Sunday, Wednesday, Monday, Tuesday. 
[02:41:30]  Go blow up in the car.  So it would just be one intern date then?  And this is what happened.  So what was your story?  This is what happened.  So we're trying to keep him...  We're trying to do the right thing.  We like him around here.  And his internship ends, and they have a rule against that.  So there's sort of a possibility that we could keep him on.  Patrice is just experiencing...  Patrice is finally just experiencing the David being touched flinch. 
[02:42:00]  And he's loving it.  He does the rabid dog look when you touch him.  We don't know why.  No, no, that's the real deal.  He gives a quick...  How much?  If you touch him.  How much what?  Time.  Four days.  Okay, until you're done.  Yes, correct.  So we got to get David a cake or something?  Four, four, correct.  David, why don't you like to be touched?  I don't know.  I just don't.  It just drives you nuts.  Yeah, it does.  So what's the...  What if you leave it on here? 
[02:42:30]  Okay.  But what if a girl...  So what's the story?  What if a girl touches you?  That'd be fine.  You wouldn't do the grrr face?  No, no, no.  So anyways...  So we're like, all right.  There's a slight possibility that he could maybe continue and just hang around for free.  Yeah.  What did he say to that, Sam?  Because I know he'll ruin this.  Well, I said...  I said, I know you won't...  Because I tried to set him up in some meetings to meet some people.  But he won't go.  Why?  So I said, all right, well then why don't you just come and hang out.  And we'll put you on the guest thing. 
[02:43:00]  We'll put you in security.  And he goes, no, no.  After my internship, I'm not coming in here for free.  Holy shit.  What a dummy.  Remember?  Yeah, I remember.  Yeah, I remember.  I remember, yeah.  But what if that's the only option?  You're just going to hit the streets?  I don't know.  How much longer can I keep working for free?  Then what happens if...  It's either work for free or nothing.  Yeah.  That's my life now.  All right. 
[02:43:30]  For longer.  So he's going to go to a regular place where people touch him and he twitches.  Yeah, and he twitches.  And they think he's going to shoot everybody in the office and get fired anyway.  So...  What the fuck?  A lot of radio guys have worked for free for a real long time.  Yeah, my parents are kind of bugging me to not get a job.  They don't want me to work for free anymore.  Of course not.  Yeah, I understand.  I've had enough.  We're trying to do what we can there, David.  I know you are.  I understand that.  I really do appreciate that.  All right, beat it.  Yeah, we've got to take our break.  We didn't break it? 
[02:44:00]  No, because it was a whole thing that happened after you.  David, David.  As we go to break, our Iron Sheik interview.  Iron Sheik.  Legendary.  A little piece of him talking about more.  Not to be confused with the clip we played where he was talking about pussy in general.  This one is called More Young Pussy.  The Iron Sheik as we go to break.  Patrice O'Neill, Miami Improv starting tomorrow through the weekend.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday through the weekend.  Wow. 
[02:44:30]  We've got Greg Giraldo in studio to join the party.  Patrice O'Neill, who, of course, has been killing for us today.  Miami Improv starting Friday.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  305-441-8200 or MiamiImprov.com.  Probably the easiest way to get your Patrice O'Neill tickets.  And Greg Giraldo playing locally here in New York.  Gotham Comedy Club Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Nice.  Yes.  We haven't seen Greg in a while.  No, I haven't seen you guys in a while.  What's happening?  I was going to ask you that.  Now that I'm just, you know, trying to get back on my feet. 
[02:45:00]  I'm back on my feet again.  Are you still with the collective?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They say hi.  The collective.  I don't know.  We didn't talk about you.  Is there inside stuff going on?  I don't know what the collective is.  It's the whole comic thing that goes on.  Sorry about that.  It's okay.  It's the comic secret fucking agents.  They're like the.  Yeah, but I don't know what it means.  I'm a comic.  The League of Nations.  It's not that we were under the same management coming for a second.  You guys just missed Nicky.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[02:45:30]  Missed him?  Little Nicky.  Little Nicky.  There's a guy that walks around here.  He looks exactly like Little Nicky.  And we brought that up a couple days ago.  So now every time we see him walk by, it's just a good laugh.  Sorry.  Back to the program.  Yes.  Back to your regularly scheduled program.  So, Greg, you're all right, man?  I haven't seen you much lately.  I bump into Joel the one saw at the cellar or somewhere else in the city.  We kind of cross paths.  But I don't see you nearly as much as I used to.  Yeah, no.  I'm good.  I'm good now.  But I went off the.  You know, I have my little substance issues. 
[02:46:00]  And I went off the rails again for a while.  Oh, shit.  But now it's all back, man.  Back in black.  Well, the last time we saw you, you were doing really well.  Yeah.  You were doing really well.  And now it sounds like that you kind of went the other way since the last time we saw you.  Yeah.  Well, I started.  What happened was I got really, you know, I really got separated for real.  Like, I was separated last year for like five months.  And then, like, we got back.  I went away to address my health issues.  And then I came back and I thought, okay, maybe we can make this work, you know.  And then that didn't work.  So now it's been like six months.  It's been totally separated. 
[02:46:30]  And then I started, like, dating and everything.  And I thought, well, maybe, you know, I can shit.  I can drink a little wine with dinner with the ladies.  You know, the ladies.  They're like, yeah, have a nice glass of wine, you know.  Jesus.  They like, and it's partying.  You know, and I started dating, like, young girls.  They're like, oh, shit, yeah, we'll party a little bit.  Yeah.  Until, like, four days later.  I'm fucking swatting robots.  Is this the first time you went to swatting robots?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, slow down.  So wait, it starts with a little wine and then four days later?  This really happened.  I was laying in bed with this girl and she said, you're really not.  You don't, I don't think you're as bad as you think.  You don't, you're not that bad.  You're just not as bad. 
[02:47:00]  You just say all this shit about being a drug addict.  But you're not.  You're just, you're just, you're going through a hard time.  Like, okay, all right, whatever.  And we're laying in bed in this hotel room and I've been, like, partying constantly.  She falls asleep and I'm still going and going and going.  And then I start being attacked by all this shit.  Like, all these, like, things are flying through the air because I hadn't slept.  And there was these, there were literally were these, like, robot things in the air with,  like, laser beams in their eyes.  Holy shit.  And I thought, holy fuck, this was, this was, like, the beginning of the, and this was this  last stretch here where I thought, that's it.  And I'm losing my fucking mind.  And I sit up and I'm swatting at these robots that are flying through the air at me.  And she sits up and she goes, what the fuck? 
[02:47:30]  She starts crying.  She's just crying.  Oh, man.  That must have freaked out even more.  Yeah, that was good.  That was good.  But I showed her.  What did you say to her?  I showed her.  Did you edit?  Did you edit yourself?  I said, there's all kinds of shit.  You won.  There's people there.  There's people in the corner.  She goes, there's no people there.  What are you talking about?  I go, there's people.  Go, go talk to that person.  It was very.  Oh, my God.  You are bad.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, you want something else besides the alcohol?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  You'll pass out and throw up before you see robots.  You know what? 
[02:48:00]  Somebody should jump over and beat you in the head like, alcohol doesn't do that.  That's why I wanted to ask that question.  A nice glass of Chablis made him piss.  Chablis.  I have a very, very low tolerance.  No, I understood that, but I wasn't, you know, I don't know.  Too much vanilla extract, Greg.  What's that?  Too much vanilla extract.  I didn't even know that there was that much vanilla extract in that creme brulee.  Oh, too many creme brulee.  I had a diabetic.  Was it Coke?  Did you find yourself?  Was it Coke?  There's all kinds of things.  What's that?  Do you feel like what drugs do to you on stage?  Ruin everything. 
[02:48:30]  It makes you much less funny, much less creative, much less everything.  It's a fucking total self-destructive nightmare, but booze at first, again, you're like, you  know, I'll stop drinking, and then after enough months go by, you start drinking a little  bit, and you're like, you know what?  This did make me funnier, now that I think about it.  And you get a little looser, you're funnier for a while, but then, you know, shit, it  all fucking works.  Then the line is crossed again.  Then you're standing on stage, staring out at the audience, just staring at you.  That was the final night, when the crowd looks up at you, and they just  have this look of horror, and you try to look around to see how obvious it is to people,  and you see a girl that looks kind of fucking, anybody that looks kind of compassionate,  they look out, and they're just like, oh, fuck, what's going on here? 
[02:49:00]  Oh, no.  Damn.  And then you just get heartbroken and self-hating.  What, were you just unraveling on stage?  A little bit.  You know, a little bit.  Meltdowns, man.  It happens.  Yeah.  God damn.  But you can't be not, like, I had a meltdown, but I'm not famous, and it's nothing worse  than not being famous and having just like a meltdown, like it's all coming apart, but  it's really not built.  And I'm not saying you, it's just, you do get those things where you just, what's it  all about moments?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, when nobody gives a shit.  Wanting to spit into my face.  Like, oh, no, all we like about you is that you're kind of likable and fun.  If you're going to be a fucking mope about it, beat it. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get famous enough to hang out with if you're not pleasant.  Well, it's like I always say, my job is to give those people a good time and help them  forget their troubles.  You're a piece of shit.  Oh, Jim.  Sure, send them out with a smile.  You bring joy to people.  I want to fucking burn the entrances like the Happy Land Disco.  And run through that to get to your car, you fucking pieces of garbage.  Jay Moore wants in.  Jay!  Hi, boys.  Hey, Jay.  Hello, Mr. Moore.  We got Greg Geraldo in studio.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:50:00]  First of all, I want to tell Patrice, that guy you said is a great impressionist.  I still haven't heard shit from that fucking guy.  Who's that?  Oh, Dean?  Dean Edwards.  A black guy.  Dean Edwards.  Dean Edwards, right.  He heard about it.  I called him and he said he heard about it, but I don't know if he's jumping on it.  He's not.  Yeah, I think he's a little more...  Jay Moore is taking on all impressions.  You know what?  I'll put him against you and I know he'll jump at the chance because he's a little more...  Like, Dean's a little more of a family man, quiet.  I'll put fucking...  What's his name there? 
[02:50:30]  The black dude from Matt TV.  Harry Spirits?  I'll put Harry Spears on you, you cocksucker.  You've got to be...  You've got to be...  Nah, Harry Spears.  Tell him, Jay.  Tell him, Jay.  I'll put him on you.  At least he'll challenge you.  At least Harry's will go up against you.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Wow.  How about Rob McNulty, you motherfucker?  I'll put him on you.  That's like Muhammad Ali fighting fucking George Chavalo.  George Chavalo.  Jay is really fucking good, man.  Hey, Colin, do you have any advice for Greg? 
[02:51:00]  Because Greg is here and he looks up to you a lot.  Hey, everybody, for Greg, stop slipping, stupid.  Jesus Christ.  You know, sobriety days are a lot easier when you put them all in a row.  That was pretty...  That was good.  That was pretty deadly.  Hey, uh...  Oh, Greg, you're all the...  That is good.  That is really fucking good, man.  Greg, for real?  Take it from a guy that slipped twice.  God damn, it's so much easier when you do it in a fucking...  I would have had fucking 16 years sobriety if I wasn't a dick.  Yeah, that's a good Jay Moore you just did. 
[02:51:30]  I never heard sincere Jay Moore before.  What was he doing?  This is actually Aaron Spears.  You can tell if I'm late.  I was supposed to call him sick.  Jay's got a good drug story.  Huh?  They said on the line you got a good Geraldo story or drug story.  I'm calling me at Reebok.  What's that?  Lee, am I losing you guys?  Can I call back later?  His phone is crapping out. 
[02:52:00]  A little bit.  A little bit.  Try one more time.  Nice.  Oh, man.  That might have been the thing he was going to say that was going to save my life.  That could have been it.  Can you imagine?  Change the world right there.  Oops.  This Colin is uncanny, though.  I want him to do Colin all the time.  Holy shit.  That was real subtle.  Has anybody surprisingly been there for you?  Is it anybody that's really helping?  Fucking Greg, come on, man.  Well, there's a lot of people that help, but the thing is, the people that know,  the people that have the problem, you know, know that there's nothing that anybody can  really do until you're at.  Something has to happen that magically you just, and that kind of shit, it's kind of 
[02:52:30]  fucking surreal, but I think I had one of those like little crazy moments.  A little moment of clarity?  Not even a moment of clarity.  I took a bunch of acid at one point because I thought, okay, how about this?  Maybe just hallucinogenics.  You know, I could just do that.  Holy shit.  Because if I don't drink, you know, then I won't get to the other shit, but if I just  do less, and that'll help me see, and so on acid, I saw what alcohol actually did to  me, and I saw this, like my body, like a reflection of my body, and I saw all this  shit going through my body and killing me, and then, you know, and it became so clear  that I was powerless.  It became so clear, and the next day I got up and started getting fucked up again. 
[02:53:00]  So, you know, it's just, it's not logical.  It's not rational.  You know, you get something crazy.  How could you take acid with so much shit going through your head?  I know, that's what people said, don't do that, but apparently some people have done  that and cured themselves just from that, because that clarity enough, you know, just  that sense of like, what it does, it was enough, but you never know what was going  to, you know.  Why don't you just take some salvia and fucking get on a plane somewhere?  Some what?  Salvia?  You ever heard of that?  A little salvia?  Oh, that little, uh, yeah, the Brazilian root or something?  It's supposed to put you in a, uh, no, it's supposed to be, uh, put you in a state 
[02:53:30]  of complete, uh, hallucinating for a few minutes.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Look up on, uh, look up on YouTube.  People who are in salvia trips or whatever, they're out of their minds.  Really?  They're out of their fucking minds.  We did a whole bit on that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Jay's back.  Jay Moore.  Sorry, guys.  There he is.  I don't crap doubt as I was driving to a set of a major motion picture.  Oh, cool.  Uh, you know, when you go through these hills, it's crazy.  Jimmy knows.  Uh, great job on Letterman, little Yimmy.  Thank you. 
[02:54:00]  Uh, I did a corporate show for Reebok, and whenever you do a corporate show, you go, you know, who'd  you have last year?  Who'd you have the year before?  Who do you have coming up next?  And I go, uh, who'd you guys have, Lash?  Oh, oh, God.  We had Greg Giraldo.  And I said, uh, oh, Greg, great.  They go, no, not really.  He called the lady a cunt.  He spent all night looking for Coke.  It was a bit of a distraction.  Yeah, that was the end of it.  Well, thanks for the 50 Gs, Greg.  Yeah, that was good.  That was a good way to, uh, you know, but even that, like, so I blew my whole corporate 
[02:54:30]  career away, you know, and I thought, but even that, I could rationalize.  You blew that away.  Not entirely.  It was, it was, it's being rebuilt, you know, but, but, uh.  So Reebok spread the fucking news about that?  I knew all the Booker people that, you know, and actually, yeah, well, anyway, but, uh, the  problem with that was that you could tell yourself, well, fuck it, I don't want to do those shitty,  whorish corporate gigs anyway.  No offense, Jay.  You know, who wants to do them anyway, right?  Me.  So you could say, all right, fuck it, you don't want to be a part of that system anyway,  but, but, uh, so you can rationalize everything until you start really losing the shit that 
[02:55:00]  you care about the most, you know, because again, even, you know, you could just keep  lying to yourself that it'll be all right.  You do all those gigs, I always fucking hate them, I always feel, I always feel uncomfortable  in those moments.  It depends on the gig, like, I just did one for, for direct TV or something, they said, just  be as raunchy as you want, just do whatever you want, you know, sometimes you  can do, they're fine, but, um, like, I've had gigs where they have  eight o'clock in the morning, fucking, you know, like the one that first started the  whole thing unraveling, I was doing a gig in Palm Springs, it was at night, and then  I had to do a gig in the morning, like eight o'clock in the morning, and some dude I know  was friends with these porn stars, sent a porn star to, to, out to Palm Springs on a Thursday 
[02:55:30]  night, on the, on the night before the morning gig, so of course we're all fucked up all night  in the morning, and in the morning, you think, your brain is so fucked up that you think  that it's okay, and that you look fine, and that it's okay, and you walk in to the GM,  fucking, you know, some giant corporate gig with, with a porn star that's been up all night  doing drugs, like, hey, good morning!  What do you guys want to talk about?  Some water cooler jokes?  Jimmy, how many times, if you don't mind me asking, you don't have to answer, but when  you got sober, did you, did you slip, or did you just dig in, and that was it?  No, I got, I was sent to rehab, uh, January of 86, and I drank in the rehab, and then I 
[02:56:00]  drank for a year after, and I got sober February of 87, and I haven't picked up since.  Oh, God bless you.  I slept on stupid shit, like NyQuil.  Yeah.  I would, I would drink three bottles of NyQuil a day.  Holy shit.  Hey, listen, is, are you kidding me?  Jay, is slipping just doing it again, or you, has it been a time where you drank and didn't  turn back into whatever it does?  No, I never drank again. 
[02:56:30]  Like, the thing with NyQuil was, in my mind, I wasn't drinking, and I did take NyQuil to  help me sleep, because I was working on a show, and they went from, um, days to nights, and  I was like, well, how the fuck am I supposed to fall asleep at 8 o'clock in the morning?  I'm like, oh, I'll just take some NyQuil.  And, like, I took the actual, you know, you talk about an insidious, cunning, baffling  disease.  I took the actual dosage of NyQuil the first couple times, and then I was taking, like,  half the bottle and a hot bath, and then the bottle and a hot bath, and you're laying in 
[02:57:00]  bed spinning.  It's kind of like any pussy can take NyQuil and fall asleep.  But us addicts, when you push through that sleep, once you get to the other side, it's  like snorting heroin.  It's fantastic.  Greg, if you're going to go out again, I highly recommend NyQuil.  No, you know what did it for me?  And I never really bought into that fucking accidental bullshit where people, like, in  rehab say, and then I went to the dentist, and then the next thing you know, I'm sucking  cocks for crack, you know.  But that is actually what happened in a way, you know.  I thought, ah, a little bit, you know, I went to the dentist, and I got nitrous, you know. 
[02:57:30]  And, of course, like everybody else, they go, let us know, does that tingle at all in your  hands?  Let us know.  And you're like, fuck, I have to start, because then we have to scale it back.  No, as soon as I feel the tingling, you know, if you feel any sensation that it's something  that's doing something, I'm like, fucking ramp it up.  In fact, I actually had the guy, I actually had the guy, I kept telling him I want more  and more and more of it, it's got to get higher, I don't feel anything.  And he says, finally, they kept moving me in rooms closer to the tanks, you know, they  had like a master system somewhere.  So he goes, next time I ask for room four, it's right up against, like, where we actually,  so it has to travel less distance through the tubes or whatever.  And then, all of a sudden, I felt like I'd leave the dentist and think, well, something's 
[02:58:00]  not right now.  Like, I want this, I got to get back to where I was when I was sitting in the, you know, back  in the dentist.  So then I'm like getting fucking amputations and things.  Why didn't you call me?  When did this happen, Greg?  But then a part of you also thinks you got to do it.  You just got to get through it.  You know, I really think this time I had shit happen, which I can't process fully yet.  And I'll explain it when I don't, you know, when my brain is clear, because I think it'll  sound way too crazy.  But coincidental crazy shit with a girl that like, like fucking God shit that you wouldn't  believe, like, like mysterious shit that you think someone from outer space is telling  you shit, you know, and it actually is real, you know. 
[02:58:30]  And so I think that I'm done, you know, but God knows, you know, it seems like girls are  an enormous trigger for you, Greg.  Well, that's, that was it.  That's a big part of it too.  It's not even a trigger, but it's like, it's a big part of the whole issue and what, what  it's all, it's all, you know, it's all, yeah.  Did you have, did you have your midlife crisis?  Like, put it this way, wait, did you get a lot of pussy when you was younger?  Are you now getting the pussy you should have gotten when you were younger?  Now I'm having the life now that I should, like, I was so fucking busy being the good  kid and trying to do things.  I didn't want it, you know, like going to school, going to law school, being the good 
[02:59:00]  guy, you know, pleasing my fucking immigrant parents, doing all the right things, doing  all that, you know, and getting married and trying to, and even, you know, and, and trying  to do all the shit that, that I, I mean, listen, I have kids and I, and I'm, and I love them  to death and I, and this is the, I got to get my shit together and I will and I've had,  and they haven't, they've been isolated from it to a large extent because I would do all  the shit on the road.  I would be like a binger, you know, I'd go on two week runs or whatever, keep it all together,  come back and keep it together until I finally couldn't anymore.  But, but then, then now, you know, then when I started having more success in comedy and then  you could live that crazy fucking lifestyle, all of a sudden it kept creeping up to where I  thought, and it's acceptable, it's not like a regular job where you're going to get fired 
[02:59:30]  the first time you fuck up, it becomes like, like almost like, eh, it's okay, because in  our business it's almost acceptable to be a little fucked up.  And sometimes you can't even believe that you got through it, like, dude, I've done shows  without sleeping for three days and been on stage and done okay, like done okay, you  know, like, you know.  Christ, I need, I need a nap right now.  You can still get all the pussy you want to get, like, just don't, just don't pick up the  fucking.  No, I know.  And there's enough hacks who have drunk guy, drug guy characters as their, as what their 
[03:00:00]  fucking are, like, fucking, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,  like, that shit is cute.  Well, I, you know.  Patrice, would you do that impression again?  I'm ready to challenge you, motherfucker.  Yeah, well, don't take on Jay.  I think that was, I think that was Patrice's Ron White impression.  Oh, shit.  Uh, someone here is saying, uh, Cigars and Scotch is saying Doug Stanhope can pull that  off, like being all fucked up on stage.  You can pull it off, but you never know what it costs you, like, after X amount of time, 
[03:00:30]  certain things that you, you don't see what's not happening for a person, like, when you  see the same person ten years later in relatively the same place, you're like, wow, they're still  funny, but why there's been no movement?  You mean, like, every headliner in Boston?  Holy shit.  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, no, you think, like, when you talk about accidental slips and, like, how you never believed  in them, I never did either.  And then I went to the dentist and I had a tooth pulled and he gave me ten Vicodin in 
[03:01:00]  a little box.  I took one Vicodin on the drive home and as it kicked in, I went to my house, I emptied  the box on my counter in my kitchen, and I counted the remaining nine to make sure he  didn't fuck me.  I was counting mine.  You chopped him up and snorted him.  A drink is the end of a slip, that's what I was taught, it's the end of a slip.  But then I was, you know, then I'm doing, like, six Norcos, you know, when I wake up  for six months and everything's fine.  And my wife's like, wow, you never get erect anymore, that's interesting. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, fuck.  It's all motives, though.  Like, I was taught, like, I gotta take medication, man, I'm not a martyr.  If I get a fucking wisdom tooth pulled, I gotta take something, I'll take it.  But I take it in moderation, or I take half a pill, and I throw them out, and as soon  as the pain stops, I dump them, man.  I'll trust myself.  Yes, yeah.  You know what, dude?  Everyone gets fucked up, dude.  But if you're doing it for the wrong reasons, dude, then you're gonna wind up just going back  to where you were.  I'm so sick of this shmarmie attitude. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, Norton.  Well, everybody's getting fucked up, Jay.  What are some of the reasons, though?  But I don't deserve it.  Oh, my God.  I love that Norton's Bobby Kelly sounds like Harold Letterman on HBO Boxing.  But Bob, at one question, stops that fucking dodo bird in his tracks.  Yeah, yeah, because he's all rehearsed.  Because Bob rehearses alone how he can sound, just once Bob wants somebody to go, God, that  was fucking a good point.  So he rehearses at home, and he fucking, as soon as you throw him a question, he just 
[03:02:30]  fucking collapses.  So you're saying it's a monologue?  It is.  I've called him on that so many times.  We were fucking talking about politics one time, and I realized how stupid he was when  he was talking about superdelegates.  Hey, Jay, do Larry Merchant.  Jim, the superdelegate.  Here's a man named Greg Giraldo who, in order to put his life back on track, had to cross  the track and get back on the train. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, that, God, when are we going to get rid of Larry Merchant?  Greg Giraldo is not only off the rails, but when he met Patrice O'Neal in Cocaine's  right hook, he decided.  But for real, Jimmy, whenever you do Bobby Kelly, it sounds like Harold Letterman when  they go to his scorecard in the fourth round.  Well, Jim, I got the five, three rounds to one.  Hey, Greg, fucking call me. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, man, I'll give you a call.  You could be a lot of different people for me.  A whole bunch of people will help.  The strange thing is how high you sound right now.  Yeah, a few people are saying that, Greg.  Nah, it's just got to believe me.  A few people are saying that.  Believe me.  I am on the phone with television's Greg Giraldo.  You tell Tony Shalhoub and the cast of Monk that I am fucking talking to Greg Giraldo  right now.  Oh.  Okay, I have to go, gentlemen.  Greg, could somebody please give Greg my number? 
[03:04:00]  Sure, I'll give it to him on air.  It's 11.  Yeah.  I have no faith that Jay will stay a good friend.  None?  Not even.  There's no way that Jay's going to walk him through without something.  He's just trying to figure out how to get your cadence as high, Greg Giraldo.  Yeah, if I ever pull it together and become successful, then he'll get my voice down.  But for now, it's probably not worth his effort.  He's got to work on his Orny Adams before he gets to mine. 
[03:04:30]  I'm telling you, man, not to sound like a fucking ass, but I just, I just, this is tough because, you know.  It's fine.  It's good.  I'm out of it now.  No, it's tough because Greg is, Greg, well, this, I didn't know this happened.  I mean, we don't talk like that, but Greg was the guy, he was straight laced, man.  He was just straight fucking, on Tough Crowd, Greg was the guy that, you know, that kept it right amongst a bunch of other maniacs and shit.  But that really, see, again, even that's the part of it, like that, that, during Tough Crowd, I was wildly out of control. 
[03:05:00]  I didn't know anything.  No one knew, man.  Colin did.  Colin fucking talked to me a bunch of times.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, well, you know.  Greg, but I never really let it go, you know, I was always able to, you know, keep shit under control, but then I would have these moments where I would go, fuck.  Like, when I was off, when I, not, put it this way, I'm not saying this to fucking, you know, but I'm, you're not talking with Junkie Pride.  Nobody's, like, I have scared the shit out of hardcore crazy, like, like, like, I've done shit and continue to do, like, have continued and woken up and started again, where people are like, what the fuck? 
[03:05:30]  You know, like, people who, who, who are, don't even have jobs, who are, like, fucking committed to, like, take this till I'm dead.  You know, like, these guys would just go, this is their life.  Their job is to be there.  Wow.  And, uh, so, you know, like, but I would do it in episodes, you know, and then, like, somehow fucking be miserable, pull it together and, uh, you know, and be able to, always be able to kind of keep shit together.  But it's, it's, you know, now it's like.  How horrible is it, Greg, being wired on a plane?  Oh, my God.  It's a fucking nightmare.  It's awful, right?  I was, I once flew, I was flying to do this fucking college gig once and I'd been up and, and I was totally, like, you know, the paranoia, the kickstander. 
[03:06:00]  And I, as I thought, everybody around me were, were agents that were out to get me and I started, and this, I mean, it sounds crazy to people.  It's temporary insanity and then it passes, you know, like, it's temporary psych, you know, whatever you call it, psychotic schizophrenia or whatever.  You start hearing people and I thought, and this one guy starts speaking to somebody in, like, an Australian accent and, like, fuck, it's international.  Like, there is an international operation to find me.  And I went and sat down next to the guy and I, could you imagine when I landed, the cops were there, they said, you're acting very erratic on the plane.  Oh, wow, really?  By then I'd eaten all this, like, all these, like, you know, sedative type of things, so they actually let me go. 
[03:06:30]  What did you say?  Like, I've been up for a few days and I've had some family stressors and they said, are you on any substances?  And I said, well, I took some Xanax, you know, because that's, that's an old statement.  They go, do you have a prescription for Xanax?  And I said, no, actually I don't, but it's, it helps me, you know, a friend of mine gave it to me, I was scared of flying.  And they go, you know, we could arrest you right now for, you know, for your behavior and for, for being on a substance it's not, you don't have a prescription for.  And I said, well, I don't, I don't, I don't know, I hope you don't.  I hope you don't.  I would have challenged him, you should have poked him in the chest.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Tig.  Go ahead, go ahead. 
[03:07:00]  Blood test me, motherfucker.  Take me in.  Yeah, but that, uh.  What did you do, you sat next to the Australian?  Oh, fuck, I sat next to him and talked to him.  And I, could you imagine what this fucking, and then it was this, like, Indian woman sleeping behind me and I kept looking between the thing, between the seats.  I'm like, and I was writing, taking notes about all this.  I have these notes, I can read this shit, it's like the rantings of a man.  Dude, that's a fucking one-man show.  Oh, it's unbelievable, like, I go, I go, they're so clever to put a, the woman pretending to sleep behind me.  She's pretending to sleep, but she's listening the whole time and I stick my head out.  He's like, oh, he's like John Doe from Seven.  That fucking, right?  This Greg is fucking. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, man, and if you, you know, like, if you.  Shave it off his fingers.  A beautiful mind.  If you don't sleep for a couple of days.  A beautiful mind guy, yeah.  If you don't sleep for a couple of days, even if you don't do any drugs, like, you go fucking nuts.  Like, I've been with people, you know, these, like, girls that try to help you, you know, and, uh, and so, like, they're so sleep-deprived at the end, either, you know, too, but they haven't even done any drugs or anything and they're just, like, fucking frazzled and crying.  Like, Jesus.  Yeah.  How's it all going on?  Don't you love all the fucking codependents that are fucking rushing?  That's great, yeah.  It's, it's a lot easier to meet girls when you've been up for four days and you can't even talk, but then, you know, you try to be, uh, uh, well, never mind. 
[03:08:00]  Well, you always know, the ones that were attracted to you at that time are fucking, there's problems there.  There's problems.  Yeah.  No healthy job, I said.  I think it does, it does sound like Jay made a point about the chicks being, like, a fucking trigger.  Well, that's all a big part of it, too.  Probably, you know, suppressing my homosexuality like this for so many years is a problem.  Well, yeah, that'll do it, too.  One dick, though, and you're fucking fine.  Yeah, no, that's all part of it, too.  You know, you do everything to kind of, I don't know, it's hard to explain, but it's all, it's all wrapped up.  The whole chick thing is very wrapped up. 
[03:08:30]  I, you know, somehow you always end up in, uh, in, in that.  Really creepy sex and shit?  Choking and...  Uh, well, the thing is, yeah, some of that, but, you know, what happens is you get so fucked up that, that part of it's like all, it depends.  Some people get more, like, I, like, I start, I swear to God this is true, I started doing blow as a way to not cheat.  Like, when, you know, when we were gonna, we were gonna have kids, cause I thought, cause for some people it's crazy sexual shit.  But I would get fucked up just drinking and then go nuts.  But if I did a tiny little bit of Coke, Coke, any bit of Coke, then that, you know, any bit of Coke and I would just sit there and just, you know, talk about how misunderstood I've been as an artist for fucking 12 hours with some stranger. 
[03:09:00]  You know, rather than just fuck around and go crazy.  I would just, and also it makes me so paranoid.  I can't be social.  I can't be out.  So if I'm doing blow, like, I'm, I'm, you know, home alone or whatever, with, like, please sleep on it.  I don't want to go into the specifics of, uh, methods of, uh, administration.  What is it about sobriety?  And this is for anybody.  What is it about sobriety that, uh, like, sucks?  That, like, I don't want to do this.  I'll tell you.  That's why I never drank.  I drank once. 
[03:09:30]  Two times I've been, once I've been drunk in Australia, by the way.  Drank, uh, drank and was drunk.  Drank, what it does is it gives you unbelievable inhibition.  Like, you do, and it's charming.  Like, I stuck my tongue on the side of a girl's mouth that I didn't know.  And she just starts sucking my tongue.  But the way I did it drunk must have made her go, fuck it, I'm going to do it too.  But that's exactly the reason she quit drinking.  I can't believe I let this animal stick this tongue in my mouth. 
[03:10:00]  That's her, that's her bottom story.  That's his, like, fond, fond memory of drinking.  But, but, but, but also, getting on stage and being drunk was, it, you're funnier.  Like, at the time when I drank, I said, fuck me.  I'm, I'm saying some funny shit.  Yeah.  And, and I never, I just, it makes you a better comic.  And I thought of Richard Pryor.  And I was like, I don't want to fucking be high and, and funny.  I'll be just whatever.  Well, it doesn't work for long.  That's the thing.  It's like, it works.  Like I say, it works till it doesn't.  You know, like I, when I first tried to stop a while ago, it, I thought it was hard because 
[03:10:30]  I thought I'm not going to be funny anymore.  Like, cause I'm not, I'm fucking nervous.  You know, like I'm not comfortable in my skin in real life.  I'm not that, you know, crazy.  And on stage I could get a little buzz and I'd be the guy I wanted to be my whole life.  You know, now I'm loose and funny and cool and comfortable and relaxed and not self-conscious.  And, and it was great for years.  I was always drank on stage always for years and years and years.  So stopping was like, fuck, I can't do this.  How am I going to pull this off?  I'm not going to be funny.  I'm not going to be funny.  I can't be, you know, but that was, you know, a bunch of years ago.  Since then, there's no, like, since then I've accepted, like, I'm not, I can't drink, 
[03:11:00]  you know, like since that point, uh, I got used to the idea that, that, that I can't, you know,  it might be funnier at first.  Like if you don't drink for a while and then you drink a little at first show, it's like, holy shit,  this does work.  I am back to the radio and then by the fucking third show.  There's a quick drop off with, with drinking.  I've noticed with anything, uh, when you're drinking, there is a, uh, you could graph it.  You could graph, you get better at whatever you're doing.  You really do.  Like I was on a fucking dart league in a bar, uh, when I was, you know, back fucking in construction 
[03:11:30]  and I'd get to the bar, I'd start drinking a few beers.  I'm laying those fucking darts in that dartboard exactly where I want them.  And then you have like one sip more and wham, the graph just drops off.  And now you suck completely at everything you're doing.  Yeah.  So the, so the goal is to like, stay at that point, but you can't, you can't stay at that  point.  Cause you got to keep drinking.  If you stop drinking, then you're going to start sobering up and feel like shit cause  you're hung over and then if you keep drinking, you're going to fall off that cliff of the 
[03:12:00]  graph of goodness and not be good at what you're doing.  When I, I'll, I'll tell you something.  When we went from afternoons to doing mornings, I was really fucking worried because I would  drink during the fucking show, uh, afternoon drive.  I'd fucking get to the show around noon, one o'clock.  We'd be hanging out.  I'd start drinking.  The show didn't start till three.  So I'd be drinking a good couple of hours before the show started.  Show would start. 
[03:12:30]  I'd have my computer monitor, bottle of beer would be behind there.  And during the show, I'd just be like, Hey, could you grab me a beer?  I would polish off probably six to eight beers through the show.  Easy.  Through the show.  Easy.  And then when we went, went to mornings, I start, I was like, I can't do radio.  I've never done radio without drinking.  Yeah.  I fucking, I'm always drinking, uh, and, and doing radio.  I was going to say the amount of beer they were hauling into our office was amazing.  Oh, fuck.  We had three.  Amazing.  We really did have three refrigerators. 
[03:13:00]  One was for food and the other two were for beer.  Turned out all three were for beer in the end.  And then the Jägermeister machine to really.  Jägermeister frozen Jäger machine came in.  We're doing Jäger shots during the fucking show.  And then we decided Fridays we need shot girls.  Yeah.  Oh, he was drinking too?  No, no, not really.  No, I hope he was actually.  Very, very rarely.  Keeping it together.  Very rarely.  Just keeping the fucking thing together.  It was me, I believe a couple of producers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Other people just pounding.  But then management finally said, look, they finally, we hired basically a bartender to 
[03:13:30]  come in on Fridays and shot girls.  Nice.  And that lasted about two or three weeks and they finally said, enough.  What are you guys doing?  Yeah.  You opening up a nightclub?  Yeah, I know.  What the fuck is this?  But it didn't worry me that I wasn't going to be able to do, you know, radio.  Yeah.  That I was going to, like, suck or something.  It's the illusion.  It doesn't, it doesn't, it's like, it does tell you that you're no good without it.  You're not going to be creative.  You're not going to be funny.  And it's just, it's such, all it does is block creativity.  All it does is block being funny.  In the end, it wrecks everything.  I remember, like, at first I thought, oh, this is cool because I like these stories. 
[03:14:00]  You know, this makes me, like, it'll be, then I can't tell the stories because it was  like, well, people are going to hate you.  You have fucking, you have kids and you're doing this shit and it doesn't, it's not going  to help you in any way.  And then not only that, I'd be on the road and meet these fuckers that I didn't, I didn't  even remember meeting.  Oh, man, remember that time we did this?  And I thought, oh, that would have been a good story if I'd remembered the first thing  about it.  You know, it's like, it's, it's, it, it, it blocks everything.  It's a nightmare.  It's the worst thing you can do.  But, uh, but you know, it's, it's what you got to, if you, if you have this thing, it's  going to play itself out the way it plays itself out.  And, and, you know, I hope, you know, that this, that I had enough at this point, but  you know, it's had enough for today, right? 
[03:14:30]  We all have that fantasy of like going out in a blazer or just a being the intriguing,  crazy guy, like, oh my God, you should have seen so-and-so like, but surviving it.  But the reality is I, my luck is not that like, my luck is horrendous.  I'm very dysfunctional when I drink very dysfunctional.  So I know I would, I would drive and I would just come home and there'd be some kind of  a limb sticking out of my grill.  Like, I would, that's what happened.  Did you know Hedberg or Jim?  Yes.  Well, what was his, his, I think he was doing heroin.  No, but what was his personality?  I didn't know him well enough off. 
[03:15:00]  He was always mellow when I saw him.  He was always like, hey.  I don't know if anybody knew him.  Like, was he, like, did he have a, you know, problem?  I fucking met him the, the night before he died.  He was doing the Caroline's gig.  We went and saw him.  One of his last, it was either the night or two nights before he died.  Met him backstage, exchanged numbers.  He was, he was going to be part of the show.  What was his, his personality, like, in terms of?  He was amazing on stage and it was very obvious he was very fucked up.  He was all touchy-feely backstage, really cool.  You know, knew the show, couldn't wait to do the show. 
[03:15:30]  And we exchanged numbers.  And either the next day or two days later, you know, we got the news.  And I think maybe the pressure of a guy like that, too, because he ended up being almost  a king of a certain genre of comedy that he had to keep up, you know, the pressure of  that.  He created, when you create, you said, if you create a character where you have to be  fucked up, because I have a character kind of that I do when I was, you know, too fucked  up, because, like, my hands would be shaking and I'd be, you know, my hands would be shaking,  so I'd just grasp the mic like this and put the mic, and then you create, like, a guy  on stage that could be fucked up and looks okay.  I'd walk a lot slower. 
[03:16:00]  My guy, you know, wouldn't look at the audience.  And so, you know, like, you find ways to make, now, if that be, if, luckily, that's not  how I developed my act, and so that character I only used in emergencies.  But imagine, like, if you build your whole fucking thing on being this guy that's fucked  up, how do you...  You gotta be fucked up.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is a...  Oof.  Fucking Bobcat.  That's brutal.  Bobcat Gold.  Gold, wait.  Yeah.  Whatever he was doing.  Yeah, that whole act that he was doing.  Having to fucking be that guy.  But then the reverse is, why is it, when you get into religion, for some reason, God tells 
[03:16:30]  you you can't be funny no more.  Like, you're either a maniac on drugs, or you get religious, and then all of a sudden, you  just said fuck.  Like, Bob Nelson with the napkins.  You can't be funny.  He just stopped.  He said fuck funny, but I'm gonna still do comedy.  Yeah, for some reason, you can't find God as a way out of an addiction, I guess, and  be funny.  Can't be hilarious in being a Jesus. 
[03:17:00]  What happened?  Jesus had to be charismatic walking through Jerusalem with those assholes.  Like, give me a break, man.  Like, it's a rough...  I guess it's a rough thing being...  You know, but some people grew up...  They take on the fucking hokier religious sides, too.  That pious, oh, I can't laugh at this, I can't talk about that.  Yeah, yeah, see, yeah, yeah, because if you take on that whole thing where, you know, I  gotta be a compassionate guy, I can't do certain types of humor that would offend things.  If you go that far, you're fucking doomed. 
[03:17:30]  Gee, let's go to the phones.  We got Josh in Bucks County.  Josh.  Hey, Josh.  We got Greg Giraldo in studio opening up to us.  He's playing Goth...  I want to see Greg Giraldo at Gotham Comedy Club, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  A million shows to choose from.  What do you got, Josh?  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I got sober when I was young with Jimmy.  I was 19.  I just kind of pushed into it as a kid for my mom and girlfriends and that kind of stuff.  And then at 31, I decided, I had a kid. 
[03:18:00]  She was born missing half her brain.  And it kind of took its toll on me.  And to be honest with you, I thought it was my reason for drinking at the time.  Well, Mr. Nagel, are you sober now?  Nah, nah.  I've been drinking and doing drugs every day for two and a half years.  Okay.  I got fucking...  You know, the pills started like a year and a half ago.  And they're at a fucking worst to try to get off of.  You know, my kid was born and I...  Is this helpful? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's got to be a once upon a time.  Exactly.  Are you helping?  There's no way.  There's no way to get sober.  That's all I want to tell you.  It works.  It doesn't.  Where'd the guy go?  He hung up on his own.  Oh, why'd you hang up, dude?  He's out.  Why'd you hang up, dude?  He's asking.  Did you just ask someone why they hung up?  But you know what it is?  It's just...  Boo!  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Well, it seems to me it's like pile on Jim Day, isn't it?  You know what?  He'll hear that, though. 
[03:19:00]  It's fine.  It's on delay.  He's going to call back now.  That's true.  What was you...  Was you helping?  I don't know what he was...  I don't know what his point was.  Liquor made his sperm wrong?  I think he was leading towards, what can I do to help myself?  I think he was leading towards...  And that's what it always is.  It's like, it's just...  It comes...  No, people know the answers.  Good is good if it's good for me.  People know what they have to do.  They have...  People know...  There's enough information out there.  People like...  But they say knowledge is no defense.  It doesn't matter what I know. 
[03:19:30]  People...  It's like, we know what to do.  I either want to do it or I don't.  I mean, it really is simple.  It's like...  But no one is like...  But it depends on the level of how much...  You know, what you're really willing to do.  You know, that...  And then they'll tell you, like the real hardcore guys will say, like, you're not willing...  If you want to do anything...  You know, you're broken.  Are you really broken down?  You're crawling in here?  Are you ready to do anything we tell you to do?  And, you know, like, obviously there's ways...  Look, people could stop.  If they put you on a fucking desert island, you're never going to drink again, right?  But then you get...  You know, so there's things, but it's not so much.  It's not like you don't just sit there and think, all right, today I'm going to go out  and get fucked up.  It's very subtle.  It does creep up and weave your way. 
[03:20:00]  And your intelligence level, as a comic, is so at the same level as psychiatrists and  psychologists.  So you can be in this state and go, shut the fuck up with your advice, bitch.  Well, that's what they always tell you.  You know what I mean?  If you're the kind of person that deconstructs things too much and thinks things through  to much, it's going to be a lot harder.  It makes it so much harder.  Because you keep rationalizing through all the things and the things that people do to help you.  And there's a lot of stuff.  And it does work.  There's a lot of things that help people.  And I've stayed sober for long stretches.  And I've got to pray to God that I'm going to stay sober now.  I mean, this can't go on, right?  So you've got to believe that something will work.  But it's like, it takes longer for people that are always analyzing and breaking things 
[03:20:30]  down and saying, well, that doesn't work.  Or if you can pray to God for sobriety, why can't I pray to God?  Why can't we form a group to pray to God to give us moderate drinking?  You know, like all that kind of shit.  Moderate.  The moderate drinking God, which is...  Moderate drinking God.  How about we pray to God and let me get fucked up every once in a while and be okay?  You know, like, and not keep going.  But they take away all those, like, any loopholes you think are left, it's like they just,  we think our intellectual brain power will help us float above other people.  They just point out the arrogance of thinking like that.  Yeah, right.  It's like, hey, the proof is this. 
[03:21:00]  Me and all my brains got me fucking cutting my wrist.  Yeah, right.  And fucking vomiting and calling the FBI.  And Dumbo over there has been sober for a long time and is happy and can keep an erection.  So who wins?  With that, we got Josh calling back to get to his point.  Josh.  Yeah, sorry about that.  My point was, I used that after two years, two and a half years, I'm pretty much sure  I used that as an excuse just to get my favorite thing back.  You know what I mean?  Like, I just wanted to do drugs for a long time.  I quit when I was 19.  I wasn't convinced that I was an addict and I thought I was smarter than the program 
[03:21:30]  and I stopped going to meetings for a couple years and then that shit happened with my kids  and now I'm in a fucking nightmare, to be honest with you.  Well, why don't you, I'm sorry not to suggest something, but why don't you do what worked  the first time?  I would like to.  You know, I talk to my friends.  I have some guys trying to talk me to going into a detox.  I just, I honestly, it hasn't been bad enough, to be honest with you.  The only thing, I feel like a faggot because my only problem is that I cry too fucking much. 
[03:22:00]  I'm depressed about my kid.  I hate my job.  I just feel like a baby.  But look at the self-set all the time.  It's like fucking nothing's bad enough for me to get sober again.  Look at the self-set.  So what's good enough to keep using then?  Doesn't sound like it's working for you.  No, it's really not.  In the beginning, I was funny.  I was way funny.  I loved it.  It was great.  I realized how easy it was to fuck drunk girls.  You know what I mean?  I'm married.  Obviously, I didn't, but it was great going out and feeling like I could get laid all the  time.  And now I'm in the corner high and miserable and not wanting to fuck anybody. 
[03:22:30]  But dude, look at the self-centeredness of it.  You got a sick kid and you can't find a reason to get sober.  You know, I'm not saying that I understand that like rational stuff doesn't sober people  up.  But just kind of step out of yourself and look at the self-centeredness of that.  But you know what it is?  It's not the reason.  You don't necessarily always even know.  Like, you know, like you find reasons to explain everything away.  Like for me, right?  My kids matter more than anything in the world to me, right? 
[03:23:00]  And I love them to death.  But then you start thinking.  You start thinking, okay, at first you think, you know, your brain tricks you into giving  you any reason to get fucked up.  So like for me, it means I don't want to label myself.  I don't want to say I'm an alcoholic or a drug addict.  I don't want to say I have that genetic.  I just want to say I'm choosing to get fucked up a little bit on the road because if I'm  an alcoholic or something, that means now my kids are going to have that.  And then they're going to have to, you know.  All right.  Yeah.  That's how I tricked myself.  And then all of a sudden you start.  And then once you get deep into it, then you go, well, fuck it.  They'll be better off without you anyway.  You know, and all this kind of shit.  That's a lie.  That's all lies.  And then you hate yourself so much that now you can't stop because now you're like, I'm 
[03:23:30]  the biggest piece of shit on the planet.  You know, fuck it.  Let's keep going.  You know, and it's and then, you know, whatever.  It takes what it takes.  You know, everybody gets to where they get, you know, and, you know, there's no one thing  that makes people get, you know, tell you the truth.  For me, it's like when I when it's just nothing's working when you just you just it becomes  a point where it becomes very clear that that it's either you just want to, you know, go  to it to your dad or or that, you know, there's hope.  Right.  And if you believe there's some reason there's hope, then then then, you know, then you  stop and do what you got to do, which I've done, you know, and hopefully this will 
[03:24:00]  look this is a fucking cheery that you know, a lot of people are in compelling.  I'll tell you that.  And there's a lot of Christ.  There's definitely a lot of jokes in the middle of this, too.  A lot of people are going through the same thing.  What was your upbringing like, Greg?  Was it fucked up?  No, that's the thing.  It wasn't really.  I mean, I through therapy and all that shit, you start finding out that there's a lot of  things that seemed fucked up.  It's not even a question of what's fucked up.  It's like how it affects you, how you perceive it.  Right.  So like nothing was my parents were cool.  But they was all very immigrant.  You know, I was first generation. 
[03:24:30]  I was smart.  I was supposed to fucking save the world.  I was supposed to, you know, all these, you know, I always felt weird.  I always felt weird.  I always felt different.  I always felt, and I still do now to this day.  I still, when I'm standing here, even you guys, even the crew and these guys, I'm always  on the periphery of everything.  I'm always the outside guy.  I always feel like, you know, and it doesn't matter.  And then people tell me, but yeah, people like you.  You're a normal guy, but I never felt that way.  You never, as soon as I got fucked up, I was like, well, hey, everybody, now I'm one  of you.  You know, now I'm normal.  And that's just something that's fucked up in people's brains.  And that, you know, and you sort of now like booze and drugs and everything.  That's the medicine, you know, that's the medicine to fix, to fix what's wrong. 
[03:25:00]  It's not like just to have fun.  It's I'm actually fixing my problem.  I'm treating my illness.  Oh, okay.  You know, and then you try to stop.  You try to not drink or anything.  And all of a sudden, that illness is still there with no medicine.  It gets fucking worse and worse and worse until you address what's wrong with you.  Then you're going to keep picking up and, you know, and going back down that path.  So, you know, and then sometimes it's just, you don't know what the fuck happened.  It's just, you just have.  It's just like the feeling of, you know, drinking.  Yeah.  I like to drink.  I like to have a, it's very ritualistic thing.  Drink every day?  With people hanging out. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, I have beers.  And you get a buzz probably?  Yeah, you know.  So why isn't your life, why don't you have a problem as opposed to whatever?  Well, I don't know.  I reach a, well, yeah.  I mean, why don't you, why aren't you considering yourself?  You know what I'm saying?  Like, why isn't everybody going, oh, man, Anthony's, why can't you drink every day?  Jimmy does all the time.  Really?  He looks at me like that and goes, hmm, hmm, hmm.  I love it.  Of course, I'm concerned.  Of course, I, of course, you know.  I, I, I know.  When you see your, when you see your friend who your career hinges upon him driving a fucking 
[03:26:00]  3,000 pound vehicle with a hand over one eye.  No, I don't fucking, oh my God.  It's a fucking gun collection.  Exhibit A.  Yeah.  Guns, you know, whatever.  No, it's, it's one of those things where it's like, um, like I was saying about, uh, about  afternoon drive radio, uh, as opposed to doing morning radio.  Now, I would never fucking come in at, at six in the morning and start drinking beers  during this show.  He would, because he would be, he, from the night before. 
[03:26:30]  Yes.  I like just staying drunk completely right through until four John's through.  Uh, no, I, like, I would never do that.  But, uh, when I get home, I fucking like kicking back, grabbing a cold beer, turning on the  TV and just drinking beers.  Or when friends come over, it's like a thing that, you know, to have a beer in your hand,  you're talking and drinking.  How many beers on a regular day?  On a regular day?  Not a party night or any of that kind of stuff. 
[03:27:00]  Not a party night?  It's like, it's, it's like a, well, it's Wednesday.  Average day.  A Wednesday?  Something like today.  I'll go, I'll probably, let me see.  I, I have fucking kegs and taps in my house now.  That's the problem.  Which is, so it's hard to count.  He kind of, he kind of ramped up.  He's got a, he's got a Guinness keg and a Bud Light keg.  The garbage man is going on welfare now for, he doesn't have the depositable bottles anymore.  Oh, shit.  Can you imagine?  He's going to be, hang, clunk.  Can you imagine?  Now, probably, let me think.  I could probably go through from, from the time I get home until the time I go to bed, probably 
[03:27:30]  a six pack.  You go through like a six.  It's not even quantity.  You know, everybody's story, you know, everybody's, there are people that get fucked up every day  that don't, you know, everybody decides for themselves what, what it's doing to them or  what they, you know, but it's like if you wanted to, if you were, there was starting  to be a lot of adverse consequences in your life, but you keep drinking anyway, you know,  or, or you, or you want to stop, you sell, or if you keep telling yourself, I'm just  going to have two beers tonight, but you're fine.  You keep drinking eight or 10 or, you know, today I'm not going to drink, but you're  fucked up anyway.  There's little things like that that start becoming, you know.  I, uh, sometimes I can, uh, like, like weekends are a different story because I know I don't 
[03:28:00]  have to get up for, for work.  If I have to get up, I kind of take it easy.  Uh, if, if it's a weekend and I'm drinking and I'm out or something like that, I'll be  like, I, I'll reach a point where I stopped thinking you are going to feel like fucking  dog shit tomorrow.  And I wake up and go, what, what the fuck?  What, what did I do?  Uh, why?  And cause now I'm, I waste the whole day laying in bed, just going like, uh, shit, I'm hung 
[03:28:30]  over.  Uh, and we fucking waste a day, but there are other days where I'll be like drinking and  go, Hey, um, give me a water or give me club soda or something because I don't want to feel  like shit tomorrow.  I got shit to do.  I got, you know, with that and I'll just, you know, I'll stop.  I'll drink fucking club soda the rest of the night.  Um, but, uh, yeah, some, some days you're just like, why didn't I, you know, what, why  did I cross that barrier where I stopped thinking maybe I should stop now? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, but that's the big, we've all done that.  That's the big, that's the big why.  You know what Colin said?  You know what I mean?  We all go why.  Colin said to me, sorry, Colin said to me early on cause, and it was weird.  This was real early.  This was way before I even would have considered it.  He said, you know, listen, I don't know if you're an alcoholic, stupid, but you know what  he did and, uh, but he started giving me this whole, giving me this whole lecture, you  know, and he goes, just drink, drink five drinks.  Don't drink more than five drinks for like a couple of weeks.  You drink five drinks and any normal person would think that's pretty fucking reasonable.  You know, just give yourself a week, you know, don't drink for five. 
[03:29:30]  And all of a sudden you're like, well, fuck, I drink more, but I'm choosing to drink more.  It's not like, you know, cause we can't choose not to for, you know, like whatever, you  know, and even if some people get a hold off, you know, but the point is, it's not a  question of just dry drunken yourself because there are people that could say, fuck, I stopped  for two months.  I'm not an alcoholic.  It's drink four, drink five drinks are under.  Or don't ever drink more than three beers for, for two weeks.  You know, cause once you have three, if you could put three beers in you and leave it  at that for weeks and weeks and weeks, then you're probably okay.  I'll have 12 and not drink for two days.  How about that?  It doesn't work like that. 
[03:30:00]  All literal Jim.  How's your self-righteous in the whole conversation?  Yeah, self-righteous Jim.  The fuck is that shit?  People are dying out there.  It's no laughing matter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You keep smiling.  Turn it upside down and see what happens, bub.  Bub.  You know who needs a good drink?  Fucking face lady.  Oh God.  She should get a pass.  Let her fucking drink.  She'll hold it in her mouth like a pelican.  Have you seen a face?  Pelican lady.  Yeah, she looks good.  Amazing, right? 
[03:30:30]  She looks good.  Greg, where's your comedy at these days?  Whoa, is that Kevin Kennedy?  That is, right?  Who's that?  Baseball dude.  No, we interviewed him in Vegas.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We talked to him in Vegas.  Kevin Kennedy?  No, what's his name?  No, no.  Mother fucker.  So exciting here.  Didn't he use some magic right now?  The hallways are just, it's magic.  Teaming.  They're teaming with celebrity magic.  Celebrities.  Who is that guy?  That's a guy driving nuts now.  He was cool.  We interviewed him in Vegas.  Anyway, where's your comedy at these days, Brad?  You know, this is the fucked up thing.  By the way, I've always loved your comedy.  Oh, thank you. 
[03:31:00]  Thanks.  I want the people to know that.  I appreciate it.  I'm actually doing an hour special in June, and that actually has a lot to do with, you  know, it's a paradox, because on the one hand, you feel like you're getting better,  and then you think you don't deserve it, so then you get fucked up to ruin it, you  know, but then, but, you know, the weird thing is, that's the one, the most motivating,  that's the one thing I can't, like, the most motivating thing is just, you know,  getting funnier and being better, and that seems like a weird thing to say for a person  who's, you know.  Wow.  But that's really, like, you know, that's the one thing I'm not willing to lose, and I start  losing it, and then it's the one thing that hits me, that, like, I can't lie about what's 
[03:31:30]  happening there.  With the other shit, for some reason, I could lie about it, but for that, you know, when  you really start seeing, you know, your comedy slipping, that's when you...  Are you talking about this stuff on stage and trying to make it...  I'm going to make it, you know, like, yeah, there's a lot of really funny shit about  it that I'm doing.  We were laughing.  There's definitely a lot of funny shit in there, but I haven't really processed it  yet, because I was living it, so...  Right, right, right.  Gotta kind of get away from it a little first, and look back at it.  You'll have a lot of people in the audience that can relate to a lot of that stuff.  Well, that's the fucked up thing, like, when you're... 
[03:32:00]  They know, the fucking...  Even if you don't talk about it, if you're fucked up, or if you're thinking about being  fucked up, those kind of people come out of the woodwork.  Fucking crackhead addicts, stripper addicts, all these people that come out of the woodwork,  everyone's got drugs, everyone's giving you shit, everyone wants to go party, and I  don't even have to mention it on stage.  If you're trying to keep your shit together, even if you don't talk about it, people that  want to help you come out of the woodwork.  People walk up...  Some people...  I've had people come and ask me for help, because I've been sober for a little while, and  they don't...  I don't even mention it on stage.  It's fucking weird.  So, yeah, it's all out there.  Right on.  There's hope, everybody!  You know who could help? 
[03:32:30]  Danny.  Danny?  Danny's great, yeah.  Can you help?  Fucking enabler.  Yeah, I help you drink beer.  Exactly.  He helps me drain the kegs.  Danny, it says six beers on a regular day.  Is that accurate?  Average.  Yeah, I would say.  I mean, weekday.  Weekday.  Weekday.  Weekday.  Weekend's a little different, but weekends.  Weekends start on a Thursday yet?  Are you a Thursday weekender?  I've gotten up...  Not out of bed, but I've woken up on, like, Saturday morning or Sunday morning and just 
[03:33:00]  heard, like, either Ange downstairs or somebody downstairs...  You've got to actually rephrase that.  You've woken up on a Saturday or Sunday evening.  Evening, yes.  Yes, evening.  And just heard what sounds like a glass recycling plant, where it's just...  What?  Clank, clank, clank, clank, bottles just fucking going down.  And, you know, that's not just me, because that's Danny's alarm clock, too.  He's on the couch asleep.  Didn't make it up into the Danny's suite. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, there are some days I don't actually make it into a bed if I'm staying over.  Doesn't make it upstairs into fucking his private suite.  Someone will find me in the bathroom one day.  Guaranteed.  Yeah.  You know?  That's fine, man.  All right.  Well, I think we've done enough today, man.  We've had our therapy session.  Let's pretend this motherfucker was sober.  I'm trying to think of a question I can ask him if he wasn't fucking on drugs.  Like, so, Greg, let's ask him and not fucking die on a drug question. 
[03:34:00]  I tried to go there twice.  It said, face transplant lady, and what kind of comedy are you doing?  And then Greg went back to the other thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Greg, face transplant.  I'm trying to say hi.  PC's so clear, it doesn't matter anymore.  I also knew.  All I know about a spiritual transplant.  It would be nice to have a face that you didn't fucking, you know.  Well, actually, I did think that when her nose was missing, I thought, well, I guess,  obviously, that limits certain methods of administration.  Shit.  Shit, no nose.  How do you do? 
[03:34:30]  Did you see the no nose when you were sober or on drugs?  Because that could be a whole different trip.  Yeah, it's a whole different experience.  Well, it must suck not to smell things.  Oh, yeah, not smelling.  That's got to be it.  All right, let's get the fuck out of here, man.  I think Greg Giraldo got the laughs out as well.  And he's going to be at the Gotham Comedy Club Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  This is, wow, two, four, like six shows.  212-367-9000 for Gotham.  And it's been way too long.  We like having you on the show.  Yeah, man.  No, I don't know.  It's like everything.  Fucking time goes by. 
[03:35:00]  I don't know.  I keep thinking, what?  Shit, why haven't I been on before?  Yeah.  We've got to work into the schedule.  Yeah, yeah.  And check out Colin's show, too, if you can.  And he's only doing it for like a week and a half, two weeks.  It's called My Two Cents.  It's not 43rd.  Just go to ColinQuid.com.  I'm going to go tonight.  Yeah, I think I'm going to go, too.  Because there's one man show on the economy.  I'm going to support the Colin.  I'm going to do the free ticket.  Fuck Colin.  You bought a ticket?  Fuck him.  Of course, man.  And I'm going to have an empty seat next to me, too.  I'm going to give me two free tickets.  I'm going to only use one.  That's what I'm doing.  Who's that baseball guy walking around?  You should do something like I do on a plane and buy a whole row.  Kevin Kennedy, right?  Instead of going first, can't afford first, but I can afford three coaches. 
[03:35:30]  Three coach seats.  Why didn't Kevin Kennedy sound right when you said it, though?  What was Kevin Kennedy?  Oh, just makes your stomach hurt, doesn't it?  Goddamn Ant.  Shut up.  This guy.  Didn't he use to match the Red Sox?  And Tyra says, she just perpetuates corniness.  I got booted off that stupid show.  We're talking about Ant the comic, who's on Tyra.  He stinks.  I like him. 
[03:36:00]  I think he's good.  I think he's wonderful.  Shut it, Jim.  I like a comic that brings that kind of energy.  I like a marvelous sense of humor.  He brings it.  Punch his chin, so it looks like that lady.  He brings the funny.  He's so irreverent, and he's so catty.  I love that catty humor.  Isn't that great?  There's millions of guys that are funnier that will never be on TV like that.  I just don't get it.  I don't understand how you guys deal with that shit.  The business is a leech that sucks your life force out of you.  I'm trying to think, if I ever laughed at one fucking thing that guy has said. 
[03:36:30]  He's on everything, too.  If he said he liked pussy, I'd fucking rack up.  Oh, Anthony.  All right, listen.  No need to go there.  Patrice O'Neal.  I don't want to go.  Your face transplant thing.  Let's stay.  Your face transplant thing will live on for a long time.  Hey, don't validate me by face transplants.  Let's stay and talk.  I'm just saying.  Maybe we will.  Let's just go.  Let's just hang out.  Miami Improv.  If we hang out, we'll be helping Greg.  Another half hour of not fucking around.  You know what? 
[03:37:00]  You know what?  Let's stay.  You could stay.  I want to stay.  I want you to stay with me and Anthony.  He's packing up his mouth.  He's making his stuff up.  It's late.  But why don't you stay?  I got to drink.  Yeah.  I don't want to stay.  I got to eat.  I got to keep my protein level stable.  Do a set with Greg.  No.  No, we got to go eat.  You need us to do a set.  No.  No.  We're barely here when you are on.  Greg doesn't want to.  Greg is, you know, I just.  We got to get out of the drug talk.  I want to be his real friend on this. 
[03:37:30]  I don't want to be his radio friend.  No fake friend.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't want to be his fake friend.  Well, then why are you putting your hat on and leave it on the air?  Yeah.  What's that?  No, because that's not real friendship.  Interventions are on the phone by yourself.  I don't need an intervention.  We were told down that road.  He's been intervened.  Yeah.  Well, I guess.  See, I don't know.  I'm using those words.  I'm using those words.  I don't have a, what do they call it?  I shouldn't be using the word.  Yeah.  That's why I swear a lot. 
[03:38:00]  A friend.  I saw a fucking, I saw a fucking bumper sticker that says swearing helps fools think.  I went, yep.  That is me.  I like that.  As I'm going, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  That's true.  I'll talk to Greg on the phone one of these days.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  You could do a set with him where you don't talk drugs.  You just hang.  I don't want to because I'm engulfed by his drug use.  I didn't know it happened.  Something happened to you.  It is, guys.  Hold on.  Something happened to Patrice in the middle of this because you got really quiet.  No, because I did not know that Greg was going through this. 
[03:38:30]  So you were learning some stuff right here.  Yeah.  I love these wild teen shows.  I didn't know that.  I'm sorry.  Enough of this drug shit.  I love, I love Maury's wild teen fucking shows.  They just had a black girl on that was 14 and I had to, I had to put my face in this  cup and bite it.  So it, yeah.  Stunning.  Stunning.  Yes.  Yes.  Stunning.  Look at this girl.  Look at this girl.  Question for you, Anthony.  Come on, little prostitute.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  There's no such thing as the law.  No such thing as the law.  What age do you stop yourself?  13.  Even though there is something called the law, it just gets around it.  Just 13 is where you stop yourself?  13.  Holy shit.  That's honest as a motherfucker.  It's got to be the right 13.  13?  What the fuck?  You've never seen a hot, hot 13-year-old that is completely fuckable?  I'm just thinking.  Are you out of your mind?  I'm just thinking the age.  13.  Let's be honest.  You've seen 13-year-olds and gone, oh my God, she's 13?  I don't know. 
[03:39:30]  Of course you have.  Mine's just 23.  Everyone be honest.  23?  I would say 16 for me.  Is it the age of the age of the road?  23 is mine.  You're talking about the package situation.  Not the look.  By your standards, if she was four, but super hot, then look.  That's right.  She had an ass and tits at four.  What are you going to do?  23 is a good age because it's really woman and it's still young.  So it's just like the brutality.  You wouldn't have a 20-year-old?  Yes, I would.  But I'm saying I would rather have a 23 because it's such a dirty age.  How old is she yet?  I have no idea. 
[03:40:00]  They usually show the age when they walk out flipping the bird to the audience.  Look at that.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  I need that to be fully woman.  It was a mess.  But you know how we live.  She's making her hold on a teddy bear.  She's sticking to the other things.  I know.  Maury's sick.  Maury's sick.  We've called Maury out on this so many times.  How fucking, just what a circus he's running.  She had undetected sex because she wants a baby.  Ain't that great?  You would that one there?  Oh, in a second.  You should be put to sleep, you piece of shit.  All over her. 
[03:40:30]  You are a piece of shit.  All over her.  She has one pubic hair that looks like a, that looks like a pine needle.  And you're just fucking pine needle.  Fucker, you piece of garbage.  I am out of here.  I can't take this anymore.  I won't fucking stand for this shit.  Listen, we gotta, can I do Pro Flowers here or we have to do it within the, alright.  She says she wants three kids, but oh, she's 13.  See?  She's 13.  That's what I'm talking about.  Exclusive last chance for our radio listeners.  It's proflowers.com.
