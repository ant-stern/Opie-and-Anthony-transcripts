<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie detailing his Huntington, Long Island weekend plans, including Jim Brewer's concert and the chaotic St. Patrick's Day parade, recalling a past experience with his bored child.  He then transitioned to his brother Brett's rowdy St. Patrick's Day traditions, notably involving nut shots.  The conversation pivoted to Bell Nox, a Duke University student and porn actress who appeared on Piers Morgan.  Clips from the interview were played, showcasing Nox explaining her leave of absence due to backlash from fellow students discovering her porn career.  Extensive discussion followed regarding the financial aspects of her work, college tuition costs, and the perceived hypocrisy of her situation, especially given her Women's Studies major.  Numerous callers weighed in on college, the porn industry, and Bell Nox's circumstances, with one caller also questioning Rich Voss's claimed high IQ. A brief discussion of a Massachusetts law banning upskirt photography ensued, followed by a humorous anecdote from Opie about nearly being expelled from college.  The hosts mentioned upcoming guests: Jim Jeffries, Adam Ferrara, and Joey Diaz, and premiered their own version of "We Are the World" featuring recurring show characters.  Finally, Bobo's surprisingly high Twitter follower count was discussed.  The language used throughout this segment was highly vulgar and sexually explicit.

The show then shifted to a discussion surrounding upskirt photography, sparked by the Massachusetts law.  This led to conversations about "toilet cams," listener anecdotes about upskirt photography (including one mentioning a Canon shoe camera's use), and a Florida "pee bandit" story, provoking comments about race and stereotypes. Further listener calls detailed unusual crimes, including headphone cord snipping and an accidental upskirt photo taken by a private investigator.  A significant portion focused on analyzing a clip of Jay Leno surprising Arsenio Hall, criticizing its awkwardness.  This transitioned into discussions about "sharking" in Japan, other bizarre Japanese videos (including one depicting ejaculation on a woman's head), and the Babymetal music video.  Listener calls continued, addressing the double standard regarding public indecency between men and women, further anecdotes of flashing, and accidental upskirt photos.  Discussion also included a fake Tony Hawk/Christopher Lloyd hoverboard video, a 10-hour loop of Japanese girls singing about diarrhea, and concluded with reflections on social media and the death of the hosts' pet dog.  Opie and Anthony were present throughout, with Joey Diaz, Adam Ferrara, and Jim Jeffries again mentioned as upcoming guests.

Next, a phone call with Paul Williams, singer of "Rainbow Connection," ensued.  He expressed frustration over the Muppets movie's limited use of his song, mentioning upcoming projects including a book co-authored with Tracy Jackson.  A humorous "hang up" incident occurred, followed by a clarification call.  They discussed his social media and planned a future golf game.  Following this, Joey Diaz joined in-studio, recounting his experiences in 1970s and 80s New York City, detailing graphic accounts of drug use (cocaine, heroin), encounters with prostitutes and pimps, visits to peep shows and strip clubs, and his perspective on the city's transformation.  He described the seedier aspects of Times Square, drug prevalence, and his experiences with three-card monte, also mentioning his recent decision to quit smoking marijuana after 30 years.  Adam Ferrara joined, sharing his own memories of New York City's underbelly and strip club experiences.  The discussion involved graphic descriptions of sexual acts and drug use.  The segment ended with plans to bring on Jim Jefferies and further discussion of Joey Diaz's podcast.

The final segment featured Joey Diaz and Adam Ferrara in-studio, along with a phone call from Jim Jefferies. Diaz recounted a story (previously shared on the Joe Rogan podcast) about supplying cocaine to Whitney Houston's road manager, receiving cocaine as payment.  The conversation shifted to Jim Jefferies' travel in New Orleans, commenting on Mardi Gras violence, his show "Legit," its move to FXX, and his parenting challenges. Diaz and Jefferies discussed experiences with law enforcement, including driving without a license.  The discussion touched upon Los Angeles traffic and strategies to avoid it, including using the HOV lane regardless of occupancy.  Adam Ferrara shared his experiences with "Nurse Jackie" and "Gotham," his love of cars, and experiences driving high-performance vehicles for television.  The conversation circled back to Joey Diaz's podcast, its early morning air time, and his personal habits (early mornings, love of cats and firearms). The segment concluded with farewells and plugs for the guests' projects.

[00:05:00]  do the clocks yes i like that i noticed the other day i'm sitting around i'm like hey it's like  almost six o'clock and right at night there we're getting some fucking light well it teases us because  now now we got to wait for that for another uh two months yeah that's what that's how that works  yeah there's a uh a girl that works here in the elevator yesterday i'm excited about the clock she  goes it's gonna be lighter in the morning i'm like no it's not oh you're dumb it goes the other way  i like the lighter at night though it was like 550 i go see 550 and you see it's sort of light out 
[00:05:30]  it's like you can uh-huh it's the start of uh you know the day now that's that goes away now 650  right but she goes oh you got spring everyone gets confused with that spring ahead fall back  thing she actually said no you fall back no it's spring ahead fall back ahead but she was convinced of  it you dummy we gave her a pass because she was just a broad uh just some broad just some broad 
[00:06:00]  speaking of broad see that last night i watched i watched peers the first time in fucking oh yeah  year it's finally not babbling about guns so uh he had that duke university chick i saw too to be  honest with you she's a bit sexy but she's also delusional she is delusional she's like i can't go  to parties anymore campus parties because they take cum in my vagina to pay my college tuition 
[00:06:30]  vagina that would be nice if she did it goes all over her oh she bathes in it oh really oh i watched  some uh some people sent me some great links of her um yesterday so i watched a few of her features  i'll i'll just tell you this if if that was my daughter i i would be mortgaging my house right  now oh boy i would put a double mortgage on that i don't know she parents have to feel guilty  yes she said you know i didn't want to put the burden on my parents for the the bill and be in 
[00:07:00]  debt so i think i'm you know i i decided to do this like you think your parents would have  minded being in debt or watching you right which i watched take a giant cock oh you've seen the the  clips oh have i ever i've i just saw a few of the stills she's on her knees yeah she's taking just  giant cock and uh doing a great job she's she's cute she's very cute very girl next door look to her  it's duke i don't know what the hell was going on with peers peers was too nice to her oh he was for 
[00:07:30]  sure but i guess i i you know i do like peers i like watching his show because he's very  confrontational you know he's not with her and and and i don't like i don't like peers because i  agree with his stance on things but i like that he has more balls than most of these guys on tv yeah  but he let her off the hook but then i'm thinking if he went too hard then you know he would be  perceived as a bully beating up on this that's true girl yep but there was a lot going on there 
[00:08:00]  because he asked about you know duke and stuff and and she's taking a little time off yeah she's  taking a little time off what uh-huh oh that's this clip oh really oh let's hear from her what's  her name by the way uh bell well it's bell bell nox as in amanda nox by the way yes she explained  that last night she liked amanda nox's face she's a fan of amanda nox she thinks she's a very smart  uh woman and bell so she can um taint the uh wonderful animation beauty and the beast right disney 
[00:08:30]  and grab bell's name could we get more clips from this broad is someone cutting this up sure  all right good but this is the clip i guess i was referring to i didn't know you had it good  well it came to a point where um i felt so unsafe on campus both mentally and physically that um  we decided that it was better if i took a few days off because your real identity was exposed by a  fellow student yes um and being on campus was just um a really um upsetting experience for me so we  wanted to just give me some time to reflect and to think right but you're actually here working 
[00:09:00]  though aren't you yes not really thinking too much i mean you're making movies well you know the really  cool thing i pause yeah so she's out in la yeah and she says she makes like twelve hundred dollars  a scene or something like that a scene that's not a lot of money it's not a lot not a lot of money  when you're giving up the gish she's giving it up oh i liked her movies they were pretty goddamn good 
[00:09:30]  i thought about you last night because i'm like i think this is your type oh it is yeah yeah that's  your type she looks like that um that miss teen delaware that got in trouble a little bit right  the uh porn movies um yeah she's good she's got that girl next door look but the stuff that is not  being said here uh this is why i love the fact that we get to yes to tear it apart duke hates  that she's a student oh yeah let's get that straight yeah they don't want her shenanigans duke  hates that she is a porn star and everyone knows it now yeah and she and and they're taking she's 
[00:10:00]  taking a few days off because i think it's the it's the famous thing that has happened to us in radio a  bunch of times they try to figure out how to get her the fuck out of the university get her out of  anything without looking like assholes so they're like hey why don't you take a few days off you  know and we'll get you back in here because she she she's she you know they she said they agreed to  let's do it let's let's take a few days duke wants her the fuck out yeah that's not good for their 
[00:10:30]  reputation no it's not but i guess they don't know how to you know figure it out yet yeah she said  she was having problem mostly with uh females with girls around there you know how they can be  probably yelling whore and slut sure like that sure and uh the guys of course are probably  very nice to her trying to bed her well of course they are yeah so and and uh it just brought up the  subject of uh college tuition yeah it certainly did 47 g's and then other expenses i think if the 
[00:11:00]  final number came up came out to like 60 000 a year to go to duke university who the hell yeah  can afford that without going into debt and a lot of parents out there they're nodding their heads  right now that's that's a tough nut you know many fucking parents telling their kids please don't do  this right she's talking like it's a viable option on on peers and i think maybe even influencing you know 
[00:11:30]  there might be some girls on the fence about it right and uh the way she made it sound it's empowering  oh there's nothing empowering about getting showered in jizz  nothing empowering about showing you you know your asshole is fucking gaping right giant cock  big blow blow a load on your face and hair and right and that's not empowering and she takes  women woman uh woman studies at uh duke university does she so that department can't be happy they 
[00:12:00]  can't like what she's doing over there so i don't know if she'll officially be gone from duke but i'm  telling you they're trying to figure out how to get her off campus for good she is a distraction i would  assume but to the parents out there so you're looking at sixty one thousand four hundred and  four dollars per year so you do the math quickly for four years that's uh about a quarter million dollars  right so you take that quarter million dollars if you could afford that and you give it to your kid 
[00:12:30]  to start a business or something you do it you know carefully you can't just say here's a quarter million  right dollars son but wouldn't that go a lot further you would think i think there's people that can  afford duke and people that have to go to a different school dude it's i understand that  like you know that's very expensive and it's not made for everybody i went to college yeah and i'm  here to say it was a complete waste of time yeah although i i used it for the radio station and stuff 
[00:13:00]  like that so i guess maybe not but i mean these kids that just go there to just get an education and  degree a lot of them it's just a waste of time big waste of time the money could be better spent  doing other things well i think a small percentage of the you know the kids that go to college you  know they get a degree and they do something really good with it but a lot of times you never get to  do anything with your degree for a very long time and then you're in debt for a long time you look at  kevin smith's a prime example he went to nyu right he paid his tuition uh after no time at all he was 
[00:13:30]  like this is not this is a waste of time and money and money he pulled out got got some of his money  back collected a few more bucks and made clerks right but that's not for everyone i understand  that no no but but it's like he made better use of his money and time than he ever would have just  going to school i i guess the point you know for many many years parents in general just blindly  said oh gotta get my kid to college that's what you did and it was okay because the cost was not 
[00:14:00]  that crazy so it was it it was a good i guess gamble i do that in quotes uh-huh but now it's  it's killing families to send their kids to college again it's it's what you can afford and  unfortunately there are certain schools that only wealthy people can afford there's certain schools  that only people that are willing to have no time to themselves because they have to work and go to  school right uh things like that i mean i'm sure there are people struggling going to duke 
[00:14:30]  that are working two jobs going to school and then there's her option which is you know  suck a little dick you get some money you pay your fucking tuition and basically you're you're paying  the quarter million dollars in this case just to have duke on your resume right exactly a lot of these  if you talk to uh teachers and and you know and people in general i guess they said they got they  got just it just as good of an education at like a community college or something and a lot of these 
[00:15:00]  professors they move around and you learn like oh your community college teacher used to teach at i  don't know hofstra yeah what is what does his ability go down has i heard the ability go down  teaching somewhere they're pretty much teaching the same stuff yep but it doesn't look as impressive  i guess on your resume if it says community college or no or i was going to say geneseo but  that's not fair because when people when people find out that i went to geneseo they go oh wow  oh my god oh hey oh but i'm so fucking old when i went to geneseo it was a horrible party school 
[00:15:30]  but now it's like the crown jewel of the suny system in the 90s in the 90s yeah sure and you know  to be fair in the early 90s well yeah you know but it was the 90s uh-huh the 90s what what happened  1990s oh boy yes sam 1990s sam that's right all right 30 year old sam  what else we got on this duke girl everyone's calling about it yeah this guy was called bullshit  on the entire story what let's say hi to kevin in philadelphia in the movies hey what's up boys 
[00:16:00]  hey man uh i'm calling bullshit but just you uh we're talking about colleges i'm a college student  right now and it's the same thing you guys mentioned i'm going for the experience and kind  of realize the bullshit behind it and how ridiculous money is that you're going for i'm going for  broadcasting so i'm here for the equipment and everything and more for the name of my resume  yeah where are you going to college uh penn state you son of a bitch i couldn't afford penn state  couldn't afford temple couldn't afford boston university couldn't afford syracuse so geneseo 
[00:16:30]  here i come like you said i probably went to half strong at the same thing same broadcasting classes  and stuff but i kind of went to penn state for the fucking showers right yeah slamming that meat  nice why do you think it's bullshit though with the girl what do you think's bullshit about it  okay okay there's no no one goes into porn today for the money there's no money as it was in the 80s  and i don't think there that she could say that you know oh i'm going because it's too expensive 
[00:17:00]  if you're going to duke you're pick them you have some kind of money duke's very expensive i think  she's from north carolina she sounded pretty well educated yeah but but i mean the problem  go to community college don't go to you but you're right i mean she's saying that she makes  twelve hundred dollars a scene i i bet you that's the high end and that most of them are down to  probably just under a thousand a scene yeah so you're talking she's got to do uh what six  what's the math on this uh sixty yeah i guess it would be over sixty scenes i figured out for one year 
[00:17:30]  miles of cock that she's gotta she's gotta take i don't know you're not even factoring in taxes  sure ah yes she's not getting a thousand dollars got to pay them fucking taxes and she's growing  in popularity now with all those exposure and stuff she's getting some exposure you will see  we're pretty good at uh predicting things we're really good and i love when people uh pointed out  on twitter from time to time than kreskin we're pretty good at it yeah i bet you about a week 
[00:18:00]  week from now she's you're gonna have a little article where she left duke she left duke for  personal reasons ah yes or just to take some time off needs a little time to herself something like  that a little privacy yeah things like that you think the duke brass are are happy that she's on  piers morgan talking about paying for her tuition through porn no get out of here don't think so  that's bad exposure for them too they're gonna not like that at all no well thanks kevin 
[00:18:30]  hey oh we have a more question for you oh no is this a slam i can't take a slam today  not at all not at all i'm a flyers fan we just got andy mcdonald's meanders  thoughts sir he's a good player i gotta be honest with you i'm so out of hockey this year  so i would just be uh talking out of school as they say oh telling tales out of school  he's a good player obviously but i don't know i don't know how he's gonna fit in with you guys i  really don't know the dynamics of teams this year i i i think i don't even think i went to one game

[00:21:00]  no she's probably not into freebie fucking yeah i don't know about that well it wouldn't be freebie  fucking it would be for an a for an a or for a grade yeah true yeah like the old animal house thing  with donald sutherland where he i should i should grab something on the shelf and his ass shows  i should have blew my professor when i was a freshman oh jesus and maybe he would have gave  me a passing grade damn that's a costly grade right there that's gonna stay with you the opster 
[00:21:30]  was a fuck up uh really good student in high school yeah i go to geneseo but because i had really  strict parents i was a fuck up because that's now you're free i gotta tell the parents out there  don't be too strict because as soon as you let those kids go forget it over johnny it's like you  talk about the wizard of oz going from black and white to color yeah all of a sudden oh the opster  was a major fuck up and he almost failed out of geneseo at the time that that's like that's a joke  so i actually was failing out after my uh i'm trying to remember i guess it would have been my 
[00:22:00]  first or second it might have been my first semester i don't remember exactly but it was my  freshman year and i was failing out oh i was done so i'm like fuck this i'm not leaving this  this this nirvana so i went from teacher to teacher to teacher begging for a uh a higher grade just  begging and i had i had it all written out why i deserve a uh a chance to stay at this fine institute  and uh i went to the speech comm professors and this one guy he he actually said to me no i'm i'm not 
[00:22:30]  going to do it maybe maybe he says and he he loves saying this to me it was a caddy shack moment  uh-huh he goes maybe this isn't for you ah the world needs ditch tickets maybe communications isn't  for you oh shit i think it's for me you asshole  fast forward i'm the i'm the the number one fucking communications uh graduate from geneseo 
[00:23:00]  but at the time he he loved rubbing in my face he goes maybe this isn't for you you so then like  one of my courses that was kind of a throwaway i went to that guy wrote up a whole thing i go i  only need a half a grade i was like right on the border and he gave it to me obviously and then i  never looked back and i actually you know proved that asshole wrong and a bunch of other people i  ended up uh over a 3.0 average the rest of the time i mean it wasn't like you know an over-the-top  star student but yeah i made the best of an opportunity because i i was that close to failing 
[00:23:30]  out and i would have been fucked what would i have done then oh i would have went back to caddying  talk about caddyshack moment but i was drinking six seven days a a week because every bar had a drink  special and living away from home where i didn't have a curfew anymore it was just no the upside  of course yes but i really believe if i wasn't brought up so strict by my mom that i probably  would have maybe drank three days it wouldn't have been such a maybe culture shock i was out of 
[00:24:00]  control you had to just run off like a maniac right yeah yeah i hear you i was i was touching clits  i was a lot of touch clits when i was living at home you couldn't just you know i think my mom  thought girls were icky or something leave the house touch a clit come back no she didn't want us  dating or anything wow it was brutal that is so alien to me because my mom or when i was living with 
[00:24:30]  my dad never said anything about like not dating and it didn't matter how young i was like oh god no  subject never came up like oh i want a girl like like leanne i remember leanne marinelli  she lived across the street and she used to come over the house and knock on the door yeah is anthony  here mrs cool how old were you i was probably uh this is like maybe 11 and 12 and is anthony here 
[00:25:00]  can he come out i was like and she's like yeah anthony leanne's here and we would go out and play you  know right hang out but there was there was a sexual aspect to it even at that age just kind of  anything just you know holding hands or or like if we were walking through the woods and she would  grab my my the back of my pants or something like that to hang on there was like this oh a girl like  you knew there was some fucking something going on and uh my mom never said like i don't want you 
[00:25:30]  hanging out with that girl or man i don't know what it was great you were lucky no i was just  abandoned i think i don't think that that not talking about that also went hand in hand with  not talking about anything it was like oh mom's got to go work again she's got to hold down three  jobs to raise three kids so we didn't get much guidance either but we had each other me joe and  dawn like fucking we were the the three musketeers so we kind of helped each other out and yeah i was i was  one of seven and we just really weren't allowed to date yeah oh like even all through even pretty 
[00:26:00]  much through high school jesus h pretty much i think i think i think when we became like seniors  it wasn't as bad but before then there was none of that man none and it was like frowned upon it  wasn't just like you didn't date it was you were told not to no we were never told not to yeah it was  just yeah it was frowned upon in a weird way by my mom that's a normal kind of an experience there  oh well she she was she she still is a mental mess so she probably thought we were gonna get girls 
[00:26:30]  pregnant or something i don't know who the fuck knows that was that's a bold jump from holding  hands and maybe kissing uh at that age to getting her pregnant oh yeah oh i thought you meant a bold  jump from what i was doing to college oh yeah i was like what whoa what yeah if you couldn't touch  a clit i think i've said it before school i didn't i didn't lose my virginity until um freshman year in 
[00:27:00]  college and you were what like eight or something i was like uh six years old but not i i was uh 13  really yeah 13 years old man i went from uh riding a tricycle to a 10 speed bike oh man i was like  wow i was like a rodeo yeah i was like a rodeo rider just trying to hang on hang on for dear life  because i had no experience stay on till the buzzer i had no experience learn fast though  then started putting up those numbers oh boy did i i mean anyway i went to a shitty little 
[00:27:30]  state school and i got on the payment plan and sold a little weed on the side uh to pay of course  i totally understand that adam in connecticut a business man uh uh paul wants to ask you and  these are all phone calls we don't have time to take right now uh the phones are lit i want to ask  anthony what he's going to think of her when she sleeps with a black guy oh yeah i don't like those uh  black on white movies so if uh i do see one i might have to just not look at her movies anymore 
[00:28:00]  that happens it happens huh that's your thing uh john in dutchess county john hey buddy hey chen  hey what's up guys i wanted to offer some perspective on the whole college versus not  going to college thing um i started going to college and i i dropped out because i didn't feel  like i wanted any sort of job that i was going to get as a result of going to college 
[00:28:30]  and my wife she went to college and this past year on our taxes i made three times the amount  of money that she did and i have zero student debt i think that happens a lot you know i i think  college is helpful for for people certainly but i don't i think the numbers are way down though i  think the majority of people that go to college get fucked in the end and they got so much debt when  they come out that's all you hear about because you know everybody that i went to high school with  you know continued with school and they got their four-year degree and all that happy horse shit 
[00:29:00]  you know i go when i go back home you know i go into delis and pizza places and i still see all my  friends that you know they have the same shit jobs that they had when they were in high school you know  yeah yeah i i uh i don't know what's going to happen obviously but with my kids uh if i see that  they're going to just go to college or go to college no way man nope i'd rather take that money and try  to focus them on something maybe they like and start melt because i'm you know i'm lucky to have  the money now there's kind of a thing going on in the united states uh where there's a few people and 
[00:29:30]  i think uh mike roe is one of them that's just talking about things like you know the trades and  uh right uh working with your hands there are certain people that might not have to go to college  it's not some like must do thing you can be very successful with uh learning how to be a craftsman  in some way shape or form uh it's it's kind of funny because it is kind of the world needs  ditch diggers to thing but you could go pretty far as a craftsman um a lot further than you can go 
[00:30:00]  some people can go with college uh and here's the other side of it eric's on the phone from west  virginia eric yeah um my wife got her master's from duke she went to west virginia but she went and  got her master's from duke and she changed jobs last week and she was worried about you know  would she be able to find another job they were drooling over her resume she had 10 offers in a 
[00:30:30]  week it was ridiculous and it helped that uh duke is on her resume right oh god i mean they were  so weird that's why i go back to my other point that duke is trying to get this broad  the fuck out of there right because it's it's hurting their reputation yeah well absolutely  and i mean it's such a lot of job you guys are saying why would you pay that much to go there  there aren't a lot of probably unemployed duke students you're not paying for the education 
[00:31:00]  or anything you're paying to have the duke name on your resume right it's not the actual education  and now this uh this porn star is uh you know is messing up the reputation adult film actress opie  please oh that's right i forgot they want respect yes empowering they want respect as they they take  their two hands and spread their asshole exactly gaping a little gaping sorry sorry i apologize adult 
[00:31:30]  film star scarlet adult film star well that's why i mean but duke's reputation is online yeah i'm  telling you behind the scenes they're like how the f do we get how to get her out of here we don't need  this we don't need this we don't need this kind of publicity nope this is like you know a step up  from the penn state publicity that they were getting that's how they feel yeah if you got any uh other  clubs from piers mooring that would be great for after the break yeah we got audio coming but i do

We are the ones who make a brighter day, just you and me, and I'll tell you, big dicks leave a bad taste in my mouth.  Come on, baby, let me know. 
[00:42:00]  Opie and Anthony are back, on Sirius XM.  Amazing.  Yeah, we are the world, released 29 years ago today, so we played our version there.  And you gotta see the video.  Yeah, the video is where it's at.  I'm not just saying that because it's on my YouTube channel.  How?  It's really worth seeing, because you see all the whack jobs from this radio show, all in one place, singing that song. 
[00:42:30]  Sam and Troy, who else worked on that?  Well, the real credit goes to all the performers.  Oh, thank you, Sam, for not being an asshole.  Yeah.  I mean, you're talking.  You're making it about yourself again.  I didn't do that.  No, I know, that's why I thanked you.  You're talking about Big A, Pat from Munaki, Sandy Kane, Tank Hankerous, The Virus.  ONA.  Opie and Anthony.  Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  Auto-Tuned.  Auto-Tuned Kenny. 
[00:43:00]  Steve C.  Mustard.  Mustard.  Frank DeFrauner.  Chip Chipperson in the early days.  Early days.  Yes.  Video's great.  I just tweeted on my Twitter.  That's a good one.  Pat from Munaki.  And I think the OAN Day show Twitter just tweeted as well.  Oh, yeah.  That's the account, right?  The official Twitter account.  Yeah.  OAN Day show on Twitter.  Kind of has a running log of everything we're talking about.  Yeah.  Taking a little heat away from me and Anthony's personal accounts. 
[00:43:30]  You son of a bitch.  People can follow both accounts so easily.  Not nice.  Oh, heat.  Where's our heat?  Do you have it?  We don't have heat.  Just because Bobo has more followers than you guys, there's no reason to be down on yourself.  What's he up to?  He's up to 220,000 followers.  Stop it.  And they're all eggs?  What?  Or Spanish people.  You keep telling yourself that.  Really?  Bobo is very, very popular right now.  Amazing.  The world loves Bobo.  Do they? 
[00:44:00]  We're just idiots.  Like, we're supposed to buy followers.  That's what every celebrity does.  Do they?  Every celebrity pumps up their numbers by buying followers.  It's a known fact.  This is what happens when you buy followers.  He's lost 1,000 already since yesterday.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yesterday it was 220,000.  Now it's 219,000 people.  I bet Twitter is just spending a lot of time fixing Bobo's Twitter account.  And there's some, we don't know who keeps buying him followers. 
[00:44:30]  It's not Bobo.  No.  He's got no money or intelligence to do it.  No.  I got excited once, I don't know, it was about a year ago, maybe a little longer.  All of a sudden my Twitter account went up to like, it went up like about 50,000 in  one day, and I wasn't going to tell anyone.  I just sat back and people were like, hey, what's up with your followers?  I'm like, what?  I'm a very popular guy.  And I was so excited because it gave me a nice number when I was checking my numbers.  And then sadly, like someone was on to the fact that they, I had nothing to do with it, 
[00:45:00]  I swear.  It was a glitch.  And all of a sudden it was just going down 10,000 followers an hour.  I'm like, oh, man.  People are bailing at an alarming rate.  And then they got it back to, I guess, where it was supposed to be.  Yeah.  When you don't buy followers or get a glitch or something, you pretty much know how many  you're going to have based on certain things that you retweet or certain arguments you  get into.  I know when I'm going to lose a few and when I'm going to gain a few. 
[00:45:30]  You're willing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really don't care.  Like, I don't think Bobo tweeting a picture of his dog and saying, Rosie Shea has a guilty  look after she farted is gaining him 100,000 followers.  That's 100,000 follower posts, though.  Nice.  Yeah.  Here's the thing.  Okay.  Yeah.  He posts a tweet with a photo of his dog.  Mm-hmm.  He's got 220,000 followers.  Right.  So that means it's been retweeted at least 1,000 times.  He got two retweets on it and six favorites.  It's very excited. 
[00:46:00]  A photo of what I am watching.  Let's go, Rangers.  Right.  And it's a photo.  It's a picture of his TV.  But I would assume a lot of Rangers fans are following him, so that should have been retweeted  a lot.  Two retweets.  Oh.  One favorite.  Wait.  Well, that's too bad.  Anyway, the guys put something together for you, Ant.  Oh, really?  Yes, they did.  I do enjoy a good put something together. 
[00:46:30]  I want to play this cold for everybody.  Mm.  But this was inspired by Anthony Cumia.  Oh, wow.  Mm-hmm.  I don't care.  Jury duty sounds boring.  I'm going to get myself kicked out.  Oh, no.  Just like I got kicked out of Coldplay.  Guys, guys, I got an idea.  How about we do a song that's not whiny bullcrap?  I haven't been this scared since Mother Teresa OD'd in my car.  She is messed up, man.  Shut up.  Just shut up.  Let me f***ing think.  Yeah, I remember when I became a man.  The operation was a success. 
[00:47:00]  What are you going to go by now?  Peter.  Well, this thing is worthless.  Like my Palestinian alarm clock.  Allahu Akbar!  Uh-huh.  I haven't seen this much denial since John Travolta married Kelly Preston.  John, do you take Kelly to be your wife?  I totally do.  I mean, yeah, yes, absolutely.  Don't you remember how much money your father wasted so he could make grand staircase entrances?  Hey, is Peter here?  Uh, hang on.  Peter! 
[00:47:30]  Why, Glenn Quagmire, it's been ten years if it's been a day.  Ugh, that's the ugliest thing the fat man's grown since that horse leg.  Hey, Peter, have you seen my...  Oh, Brian, I'm sorry, but what do I keep saying?  Do not stand behind me.  Oh, man, this is even more intentional time I forgot how to sit down.  This is turning out worse than Stewie's iPod commercial.  Oh.  Oh, boy, this gig is even better than that job I had providing nighttime heat for Lara Flynn Boyle. 
[00:48:00]  Thanks so much, Peter.  I was getting a little chilly.  Has your father ever killed anyone that you know of?  Well, once by accident when he was in the military.  All right, you all know your orders.  When you see the Taliban come over the horizon, you open fire immediately.  Okay, so when I see Pat Tillman come over the horizon, I shoot him.  No, no, no.  When you see the enemy come over the horizon, you shoot the enemy.  Okay, good.  Now repeat it back to me.  Okay, I shoot Pat Tillman, then run over the horizon.  No!  There you go.  How long did that go on, too? 
[00:48:30]  The Tillman thing.  There was 800 fucking back and forths.  It's based on your observation.  I fucking can't even deal.  You can't deal anymore.  And for the most part, it comes on right after Seinfeld here in New York.  And I see the beginning all the time.  And I grab that remote.  But I can't turn it off fast enough.  That reminds me of the time.  There's always a time.  Oh, does it?  One time.  That's like when.  Oh, is it? 
[00:49:00]  Is it like when?  It's a very popular show.  I gather.  Yeah.  I am about done with it.  The audience brought it back.  That's how popular it is.  Well, back when they brought it back.  Yeah, it's been a long time since they brought it back.  That was fucking forever ago already.  Not a fan, I gotta say.  Not a fan.  Based on what?  Based on the time that I.  Yeah.  That reminds me. 
[00:49:30]  That reminds me of the time.  You know, and that repetitive humor.  You know, the longer it goes on, it gets stupid.  And then it gets angering.  And then it gets funny again.  Right.  It just doesn't get funny again.  No?  It just gets angering.  Some people say it gets funny again.  Not on that show.  They're trying to figure out Bob Costas' pink eye.  Wait, he still has it?  I don't know if he still has it.  That's a good question.  You blamed it on duty.  Yeah, it's gotta be duty flakes. 
[00:50:00]  You said that he was probably wiping a little finger,  poked through some of that toilet paper.  Yep.  And then he rubbed his eye and got duty eye.  Yeah, you get a little flake in there.  I think that's what causes pink eye.  I think that's the only way you get pink eye.  So if you see someone with pink eye,  know that they rubbed duty in their eyes by accident.  Not a big smear, just there's a microscopic.  Just there could be a particle, yeah.  Bob Costas' Olympic pink eye from botched Botox. 
[00:50:30]  What?  That's another full of shit article from page six.  They love the full of shit articles.  NBC's primetime Olympics host who has had to take a six-day absence  from coming down with viral conjunctivitis in both eyes.  Jesus.  Why couldn't they just say pink eye?  He contracted the infection after a Botox procedure to smooth out wrinkles  prior to the Olympics.  He wanted to get all gussied up.  Oh, he was getting his eyes in shape for the Olympics.  Bob's eye infection was due to botched Botox. 
[00:51:00]  This isn't the first time he's had it.  NBC strongly denies that Costas,  who arrived to host the games in Sochi,  with a forehead smoother than the Olympic lose track.  I get it.  They fucking popped that thing up.  How do they come up with this stuff?  Hilarious.  Developed the infection from a Botox procedure.  A spokesperson for NBC Sports insisted to us,  this has zero truth to this.  Zero.  Oh.  So. 
[00:51:30]  Which means it's completely true.  Doctors say it's very rare to contract an infection  from a Botox injection.  Yeah?  Very rare.  Unless there was contamination  or the patient suffered an allergic reaction.  Hmm.  So.  How do you get the pink eye then?  Don't you have to get it from someone else?  I just told you how.  Yeah, doody.  One time?  That's like the time I had doody on my face.  I saw the Woody Allen movie last night. 
[00:52:00]  Jasmine.  Yes, I did.  Blue Jasmine, I think it's called.  I saw Blue Jasmine.  I liked it.  Of course.  It was good.  Woody Allen knows how to make a good movie.  It was good.  No, well, you know what?  Some great writing.  I don't agree with that.  Personally, I'm not a fan of Woody Allen movies.  Oh, that's right.  You're not.  One of those fucking things.  And there was one thing in the movie that did annoy me, and it was very Woody Allen.  Enough with the old-timey jazz saxophony music on top of some of the scenes. 
[00:52:30]  The street scene, they're walking down.  It's like 1930s fucking music.  Well, it was a period piece.  Oh, that's right.  It wasn't.  No, I know.  Yeah.  But I liked it, and I thought Dice was great.  But he played Dice.  He didn't play over-the-top Dice.  Right.  Which, you know, he played like a guy that would be Dice, you know?  So I thought he did pretty good.  He had the cigarette that wasn't lit again. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Oh!  You know, he wasn't doing that.  Hey, Woody, I need this cigarette.  Yeah.  So Woody was forced to, you know, work the cigarette thing into the scenes.  Work the cigarette in with the Dice thing.  But it was good.  It was well-acted and funny.  That Cate Blanchett knows how to act.  Cate Blanchett was really good.  Oh, was she a pathetic mess in that one?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's an all-right movie.  I liked it.  I never made it to the end.  No?  What I liked, what I saw, I liked.  I forgot.  Then something was going on, and I had to turn it off or something. 
[00:53:30]  And then I said to myself, I'll get back to it eventually.  And then get it.  I didn't.  I figured out that it just ends, like, poorly for everybody, I guess.  Well, yeah, everybody's pretty much, you know.  Where they were.  Where they were.  Right, exactly.  That's how Woody Allen movies go.  Yeah.  And then the credits roll, and this dumb music starts playing.  But what pissed me off was Fios, Verizon Fios, which I am a strong advocate. 
[00:54:00]  What happened with you and Fios?  It's something that...  That's your boy.  That's your boy.  My boy Fios.  You were praising your boy Fios for a while.  I told you this would happen.  The honeymoon's over.  I love Fios.  Anytime I've had any issues, they've solved the problems.  I'm very happy with them.  But there's something that's been a problem for forever, since I've had Fios.  It's the one issue that I don't know what the fuck, why they can't deal with this.  You get a movie on demand, which is what I did with Jasmine. 
[00:54:30]  And you watch it, and then, oh, I've got to pause.  So you pause the fucking movie to go take a piss, grab a beer, grab something to eat, whatever the fuck it is.  And it doesn't stay paused forever.  You know, it'll go back to regular TV.  Right.  And then it'll have the menu screen on demand.  It'll say, resume movie.  Sure.  Stop.  Right.  Restart.  Something like that.  Every fuck time I hit resume movie, here's the fucking beginning of the movie. 
[00:55:00]  Really?  It goes back every time.  Oh, no!  And why is Fios deciding that it needs to go back to the cable?  To the beginning of the...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Just leave it alone.  Look, if I'm pausing, you know, let it be.  Let it sit there forever.  If I want to pause it till ten years from now.  Until it burns an image into your TV.  Hey, who cares?  Right.  I've made that choice.  I've made that choice.  Until there's nothing left of the television. 
[00:55:30]  Don't go, well, I think, you know, I think it's time to go back to cable.  No.  I was livid.  Because then, you can only fast forward two times.  X.  Two X speed.  Really?  Why only two X?  And it's always at the end of the movie.  Time Warner.  Four X.  Four X.  I could go 32 X on certain things from my DVR and things.  Of course.  And then when you're streaming a movie on demand, you can only suck it up that fast.  Two X.  Two X on demand. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, that stinks.  Fast forward.  Are you sure that's all they do?  Yeah, because it's streaming.  Wow.  So I'm sitting there watching the movie again at only twice the speed.  Waiting to get to where you are.  Waiting to get to where I was, which was very close to the end of the movie at that point.  So annoying.  And it always happens.  When you hit resume movie on Fios, it will take you to the beginning of the fucking movie.  So why do you keep doing that?  Because I gotta fucking take a piss or something and I wanna pause the movie.  Why don't we just go backwards for two minutes and then let it play and then time it out that way somehow? 
[00:56:30]  Well, alright, I could, but let me tell you something.  It should just resume the movie!  Yes, of course.  I don't disagree.  Oh, it was angering!  We got a phone call from yesterday's show.  Jeff picked up on something.  A few people picked up on this fact.  That's why we're taking your call, Jeff.  Go ahead.  What's going on, gentlemen?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Yesterday, whenever Sloppy Mouth came in, he was saying how he scored a 120 and then a 121 on his IQ test. 
[00:57:00]  Yes, that would be Rich Voss, yes.  Yes.  Then whenever that genius came in, Voss tried to say about him being a genius again, but now his score was a 140 and a 141.  I heard him say he got a 140, but then he took the other harder one and still got a 120.  That's what I remember him saying.  Wow.  The second time he said it, like I said, you're there, because he even said it then again on the run.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're missing the obvious, though.  He didn't get a 120.  He didn't get a 140. 
[00:57:30]  He didn't get a 121, and he didn't get a 141.  Right.  I will bet $1,000, Rich Voss.  Take the same exact test.  I don't even care if it's the one you took at home.  Uh-huh.  You're not scoring over a 120 on an IQ test.  No.  There's no way.  Love you guys.  Punch it out.  And we're going to grade tough.  Yes.  Where he has to spell it properly and all that.  And we'll watch him.  Of course.  There's no way.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  I think he was full of shit, of course.  120.  Could you imagine Rich Voss with a 140 IQ?  No.  No.  It didn't happen.  Of course it didn't happen.  Very sad day in Massachusetts, by the way.  What happened in Massachusetts?  You can't upskirt anymore.  Oh, wow.  That was fast.  Mass lawmakers passed Bill outlawing upskirt photos.  Now, didn't they have a problem?  They were...  Very sad day for Massachusetts.  Oh, yeah.  Some guy was taken to court because he was doing upskirts, and then they ruled that the 
[00:58:30]  law wasn't specific enough, and since there was no real nudity involved, that the guy  was, you know, doing something that was completely legal.  And then what, they turn around, and overnight, they're like, ah, let's fix this.  Yeah, because it's creepy.  It is creepy.  Upskirt pictures are creepy.  Yeah.  Massachusetts lawmakers have approved legislation to crack down on those who secretly take photographs  of the sexual or other intimate parts of women or children.  Jesus.  That's got to get you all fucking creeped out. 
[00:59:00]  Like, all like adrenaline, like you're robbing a bank or something.  Right.  You shove that camera.  What do you do?  You shove your cell phone under their skirt?  Oh, God.  How do you get that close?  Supposedly, it's all about the shoes.  What do you mean?  You've got something on your shoe.  What?  Like a shoe mirror?  It's like a Get Smart thing.  Wait, you tape the phone to your shoe or something?  I don't know.  I know some of these guys will have a nice shiny shoe so they can see stuff.  Oh, so they could do a little recon first?  I don't know.  Where are the upskirt people? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, where are they?  Call the show.  Well, I'm positive you could take a little camera like that.  It's so hard to take your cell phone.  You can't take your cell phone and do an upskirt.  What if their back is turned?  I think they're way more clever than that.  I think they use shopping bags, I believe.  Oh.  And you move the shopping bag close to someone.  Right, right.  You could probably do it with a pinhole cam now and just tape it to the front of your shoe.  How do they do the upskirts?  I forget.  How are they doing the upskirts?  Thursday's vote came a day after the state's highest court ruled that a man who took cell phone photos up the skirt of female passengers riding the Boston subway didn't violate state law. 
[01:00:00]  So they changed that law immediately.  Exactly what you just said, that it wasn't illegal at the time.  The legislation says anyone who tries to photograph another person's sexual or intimate parts without that person's consent would face a maximum penalty of more than two years in jail and $5,000 fine.  Damn.  A penalty would jump to five years in prison or a $10,000 fine if the victim is under 18.  That's cray. 
[01:00:30]  We're the upskirt people.  They're not calling yet.  They're not letting us know how you do it.  Cool, you guys.  Let's see.  The Supreme Judicial Court on Wednesday had said that peeping Tom laws protect people from being photographed in dressing rooms and bathrooms when nude or partially nude.  Nude.  But the way the law is written, it doesn't protect clothed people in public areas.  Oh.  Those aren't upskirts.  Those are like short wedgies.  Girls with short wedgies like that, too, though. 
[01:01:00]  House Speaker Robert DeLeo had said lawmakers were racing to get a bill to government DeVell Patrick's desk.  As soon as the end of the day, DeLeo said he thought the state's existing laws were sufficient to prosecute those who took upskirt photos.  Is it really a rampant problem that needed attention immediately in Massachusetts?  What's going on in Massachusetts?  Of course not.  Just upskirt motherfuckers.  Or does it make them look good and it's easy legislation?  And it's another fucking phony politician trying to make themselves look like they're doing something. 
[01:01:30]  A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who's wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body.  Or the like covering these parts of her body.  Or the like.  Huh?  Yeah, skirt, dress, or the like.  Or the like.  Okay, covering these parts of her body is not a person who is partially nude.  Nude.  No matter what it is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing. 
[01:02:00]  That was the original law, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I love the non-real problems that they address within 24 hours.  Oh, yeah.  They're on it.  They're doing it.  But then real problems.  What's the matter?  You can't get together and fucking hammer something out for that?  They found a loophole that they had to get rid of immediately.  Right.  In Massachusetts.  How about like real problems and you get together and deal with that?  In one day.  Yeah.  Budget problems. 
[01:02:30]  You're right.  Boy, can they hammer out.  When they have to, they can legislate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  Phony balonies.  That's what they are.  Were you a fan of the upskirt?  I always thought it looked creepy.  Yeah, I think it's creepy because they're not willing.  But if you take...  But everything's all crooked and stuff too and there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You take all emotion out of it.  You know, some of them are kind of cool.  Yeah.  But...  What about toilet cams?  Where you at with toilet cams? 
[01:03:00]  You know, I'm into watching a hot chick take a piss.  Yeah.  Toilet cams.  I'll watch that.  Really?  Yeah.  Show me one.  Where's a hot chick taking a piss?  What comes up when you put toilet cam in the old Google?  I don't want no MILF take a...  Whoa.  Jesus.  Jeez.  That's a...  Boyer toilet cam.  All right.  That's fake, right?  These are fake though, right?  I think so.  I don't know.  This turns you on though, huh?  She's going to pull her fucking panties down. 
[01:03:30]  There's a camera in the toilet?  How'd they swing that?  She's...  Here she goes.  She's ready to pull down.  What's she doing pulling up her cuffs?  Why is she pulling up her cuffs?  What does that do?  I don't know.  All right.  She's getting ready.  Oh, yeah.  Get in there.  Is she going to take a dump?  She's squatting.  She doesn't want to sit on the...  Is she going to take a dump or a piss? 
[01:04:00]  A sissy.  Oh, Jesus.  Really?  Are you serious?  That's kind of cool.  And the curtains get shut.  This is kind of cool, huh?  Why is this cool?  I don't know.  Because you're looking at a pussy and ass, I guess.  Right.  I don't know.  The mechanics of it are pretty cool.  Logistically, it's kind of cool.  A piece into a syrupy.  There it goes.  Drip dry right there. 
[01:04:30]  This guy says, I think I know how they do upskirt pics.  That means he does know.  He doesn't.  Let's say hi to Tony in Texas.  Tony.  Hey, I'm going to make it up.  But I think this is how they're going to do it.  On the trolleys and subways, when they're crowded, you've got the people sitting down.  And then the ones that are standing up, holding onto that pole.  The people sitting down are doing the picture taken under the skirts of the ones standing up, I bet.  All right.  Makes sense.  It does make sense. 
[01:05:00]  Let's say hi to Ian in Charlotte.  Wow.  Ian, what's up?  Ian.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I did a quick search, upskirt camera.  Canon actually has one for your sneakers.  So you can put a camera on your sneaker.  Wait, they make it specifically for that?  Yeah, it's called the Canon image class.  Yeah, but I don't think Canon's promoting the fact that it's for upskirts.  How are they promoting it?  Knowing that people are going to use this camera for upskirts, but they can't say that. 
[01:05:30]  So how do they say you need this camera on your shoe?  Right.  Good question.  But a lot of the advertisement looks like it's in Japan.  Of course, Japan.  Those Japanese love shit like that.  I guarantee they love a good upskirt.  Oh, do they ever?  I guarantee it.  All right.  Just thought I'd share it.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks for your sharing.  Yeah, but Canon's shoe camera, how do they promote it?  Why do you need the Canon shoe camera?  Because it can't say for upskirts.  Yeah, you could say like, oh, it's good if you want to see if that true coat on the bottom of your car is still there. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, you put your foot under and you're videoing.  What else could you possibly use it for?  No answer on that.  No answer on that.  Yeah.  That's too bad.  Maybe that guy was full of shit.  That last caller was full of shit.  I don't know about that.  I bet you there's a shoe camera.  Hmm.  Anyway.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  All right, Massachusetts.  Thanks.  Well, that's got to be a law everywhere now.  A little more.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They'll, they'll, that'll spread like wildfire.  Hey, let's check our upskirt laws.  Make sure there's no loopholes.  No one's calling about upskirts.  No.  Come on, guys.  They're not very.  What's the turn on with upskirts?  They're not completely like this amazingly popular thing, I don't think.  They're out there, you know.  Doesn't sound right creepy.  Yeah, it is a little creepy, but they're out there, but it's not at a rate where you 
[01:07:00]  got to worry about it, I don't know.  All right.  Well, we can move on as we wait for upskirt phone calls.  Uh-huh.  We got a, a pee bandit.  I love these guys.  Oh, this guy.  I read about this guy.  You did?  What's the deal?  Uh, apparently he's, uh, pissing on people.  What?  I don't know what goes through people's heads.  Where's the pleasure in that?  Look, because I don't know any of the victims.  Yeah.  This stuff makes me laugh.  I don't know if I'm supposed to laugh at this, but it's because it seems so ridiculous 
[01:07:30]  and silly.  Yeah, but if it was somebody you knew.  Oh, I'd be, oh, of course I'd be.  Yeah.  I would be pissed off.  Ah, better to be.  Man urinated on people near Florida campus.  Police is searching for a man who has been urinating on people near the University of Florida campus.  The victims told police they were standing with their backs turned to the man when they  felt themselves being urinated.  Oh, man, is that fucking, that's just an animal move.  Ah, that's just creepy.  That's what animals do. 
[01:08:00]  They mark their territory on you.  The victims all told police that when they confronted the man, he ran away.  Of course he ran away.  The suspect is described as a?  Uh, white, white male.  This is a white, white guy crime, right?  Of course.  You would be wrong on this one, sir.  Black guy?  This is such a white guy thing, though.  Seems crazy white guy would do something.  Uh, described as a black man, approximately 25 to 30 years of age, 6 feet tall, medium to  chunky build, short curl, well, okay.  Short curly hair, really?  Uh, dark, okay. 
[01:08:30]  Uh-huh.  Of course.  Yeah.  Wearing, uh, of course he's wearing that.  And also baggy, of course he's wearing that.  We get it.  Uh-huh.  I thought it was crazy white guy crime, but black people are kind of infringing on white  people's, uh, crimes these days.  You know?  Not really.  Well, kind of.  A little serial killing.  Shit like that.  Where's the serial killer?  Where's the black serial killer?  I heard about a couple of black serial killers. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not crazy, but, uh...  Uh, let's say hi to Brian in Pennsylvania.  Brian.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey, um, I actually knew the girl that got, uh, the law for upscriting passed in Pennsylvania,  and basically all the guy did was he hangs out in the food court and waits for some girl  to lean over a counter and walks up to the cell phone.  Yeah, and just, like, puts it right there and...  That takes balls.  That's crazy.  Yeah, he ends up chasing a guy like 10 miles and flip-flops while on the phone with 911 
[01:09:30]  and got it taken care of.  Right.  Caught like that.  Yeah, that takes balls.  I don't know what you're doing.  Yeah, that's about it.  I saw a video online yesterday of some guy that was walking up to people, uh, out on  the street with a pair of scissors and just snipping their earbud cords.  Why?  And running away.  Why?  Just to be an asshole.  Snip and he runs away and videos it.  People are just bored.  I know, there's so many fucking stupid.  We're all just bored.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  Uh, Jim in Virginia Beach.  Jim.  Hey.  Hey.  Good morning, guys.  What's up?  I saw on our newscast last night when they were talking about the story, they showed  a mall, a busy mall with people walking in it while they were doing the story, and they  showed a guy carrying a guitar case.  Oh.  And they didn't say nothing about it, but you saw that during the story and you're like,  hey, you could put one in the end of a guitar case.  Guitar case. 
[01:10:30]  Pointing up a little.  You got a little length on it so you don't have to get too close.  You put it under that skirt.  Whammo.  Damn.  Yep.  Yeah.  It's B.  But like I said, that's what I took from it.  That's a good one.  Right.  All right.  Thank you.  I like just going in.  Thank you.  I like going in with an old, like, 1980s camcorder, VHS.  Jesus.  And just shoving it right under her skirt.  Right.  So you could just spread your legs a little wider.  Right.  Not getting a good view.  Oh, here's a P.I. who's been accused of taking upskirt pictures. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, boy.  Let's say hi to Joe and Morley Moore.  And Boldy Moore.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was working one Halloween, and a chick worked at one of those spirit Halloween stores.  And she was dressed as Wonder Woman.  And she had a back injury.  I'm following her for, like, a workers' comp fraud claim.  Yeah.  And she's bent over.  And this is the money shot.  This is exactly what I need. 
[01:11:30]  I had hit the switch on my camera and turned it over to, like, a regular picture instead of video.  Uh-huh.  The flash goes off.  The shutter makes a noise.  So it's such an asshole.  Whoops.  She gets right in my face.  Hey, but doesn't Wonder Woman...  She asked me if I'm taking a picture, and...  Oh, my God.  Doesn't she wear, like, bloomers?  Like, doesn't Wonder Woman wear, like, shorts?  There was a skirt.  I mean, she had on tights, but... 
[01:12:00]  But Wonder Woman...  I think Wonder Woman wears, like, those dumb, big, stupid shorts.  Yeah.  I think you're right.  Well, it was a red skirt.  What kind of camera...  What kind of camera did you have as a P.I.?  How small was it?  Well, you know, I'm a little low-rent.  That...  That...  On that day, my little...  I was using a little digital camera, like a Sony...  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I screwed up.  That's funny, though.  The flash goes off, and the shutter...  They never asked to look at my video. 
[01:12:30]  If they would ask, I had fucking hours of video on her from that day.  Wait, did you get in trouble?  No, they just told me to leave.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah.  I don't know.  But, tough.  Anyway, punch it out, boys.  Mm-hmm.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Good luck.  We got a lot of guys coming in today.  Yes, we do.  We got Mad Flavor, also known as Joey Diaz, coming in in a little while.  I don't know where Mad Flavor comes from.  Well, ask him, man.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Why Mad Flavor?  What is that?  That sounds like a rapper kind of name.  True.  Sounds like a black guy name.  Adam Farrar is coming in today.  Jim Jeffries is calling the show today.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, we have more clips from, uh, the porn, uh, girl from Duke.  Oh, I do like her.  And why do we have Prince performing funk and roll for the first time in Arsenio?  If you want to hear the new Prince song.  I don't know.  Prince was on Arsenio?  Yeah.  Arsenio is actually doing pretty well out here.  Is he?  They gave him his second season.  The fuck's watching it?  Jay Leno came out. 
[01:13:30]  Did we play that clip here, or was that something I just watched?  Jay Leno came out to tell Arsenio that he got picked up for a second season.  Really?  Yeah, Jay's doing pretty much everyone's show now.  Is he just walking around, like, to other people's talk shows?  There's a rumor.  Yeah, you're doing.  A strong rumor he's going to be doing Letterman soon.  Hmm.  He might be part of that.  Not the Letterman angle, but maybe he'll come in and say hi to us as well.  That'd be cool.  That would be pretty goddamn cool.  Arsenio's doing a lot to cater to urban audiences.  Oh. 
[01:14:00]  That's, I think that's his spin on this.  Yeah?  I, uh, I've watched clips of the Arsenio Hall show.  Um, it's, it's like going back in time.  It's kind of creepy.  It really is, yeah.  He almost looks exactly the same.  Almost.  The set, I think, I think he brought back the exact set.  Yeah, it looks the same.  Uh, his, his delivery of overly happy to be there.  Broadcaster now.  Here's Jay Leno coming out to surprise Arsenio. 
[01:14:30]  Okay, who's that?  I guess they go way back.  I didn't know that.  They were pals.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, hey.  Jay Leno, ladies and gentlemen.  That's gang stuff.  I think we know.  I think we know he's Jay Leno.  Yeah.  Oh, I've seen you.  Don't try to act black like that. 
[01:15:00]  I am here for a reason.  And they're not your friends in the audience.  Now, we've known each other, what, 35 years?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We've been through a lot together.  Good, bad.  Yes.  But you've always been that big brother there for me, giving me too much advice sometimes.  Yeah.  Can you pause this?  Well, I hated this clip.  I just remembered.  And I really like Jay Leno.  I do.  It's easy to hate on Jay Leno, but the fact is, he got the job done for many years. 
[01:15:30]  And I do like him.  But they've been friends for 35 years, and it just doesn't seem like it in this clip.  Arsenio's trying to act.  And there's acting going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was that line he just said?  Maybe sometime too much.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hmm.  Bold.  If it's two guys that have known each other for 35 years, why can't they just have a quick conversation?  Yeah.  Like, it's so, this is like so forced.  Forced and fake.  And fake, yeah.  They know what's happening.  Arsenio knew that Jay Leno was going to surprise him. 
[01:16:00]  Unfortunately.  Why can't you just have Jay Leno surprise him?  Yeah.  And then, obviously, they worked out, well, you'll say this.  I'll say this.  Yeah.  The writers, obviously, got involved and threw a couple lines in there.  We could make this funny.  Right.  All right.  Now play it again.  I did remember I hated this.  It's funny.  Why is it funny?  Just because, like, halfway through the clip, you're like, oh, I remember now.  I hate this.  I was uncomfortable.  Oh, yeah.  I hate this.  It was forced.  It wasn't a real moment.  That's what makes Arsenio's show so uncomfortable.  It's all, like, it seems fake and rehearsed. 
[01:16:30]  But they want it to come off like it's spontaneous.  Spontaneous.  Yeah.  Just have a real moment.  And if it works, great.  If it doesn't, oh, well.  You're both comics.  You could kind of spin it and make fun of the fact that it didn't work.  And nobody's watching anyway.  Well, that's true.  I don't know about that.  Because watch what Jay does here.  Maybe in the demos.  We've known each other, what, 35 years?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We've been through a lot together.  Good.  Bad.  Yes.  But you've always been that big brother there for me, giving me too much advice sometimes.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  That's acting.  Well.  It's almost like a vaudevillian skit.  Right.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like old, like.  That was really bad acting.  Who's on first?  Yeah.  They're going to start going, whatever we do.  Wherever we go, we're together.  You should have tapped his cane on the ground twice after he said that.  They have straw hats on.  Yeah.  Are we going to play the whole clip?  Really?  All right.  All right.  Brother there for me, giving me too much advice sometimes. 
[01:17:30]  Too much.  More bad acting.  Well, money.  No?  No.  Because you only $20.  For some reason, they thought I should be the best.  I bombed.  You delivered.  Nobody here.  They don't know.  Delivered him a note.  You don't know what this is?  Nobody else knows what this is?  What is this, Jeff?  You know what it is.  Arsenio Hall is better certifies.  Arsenio Hall is officially picked up.  We'll continue for a second season.  Oh, wow.  You don't think they called Arsenio and let him know? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  What if he didn't want to do it?  Right.  Right.  You don't think they negotiated that?  Of course.  We don't need to see the rest of it.  Let's go to our losses.  Uh-huh.  What happened was, yeah, they're like, hey, we got picked up for a second season.  Maybe we could work, you know, Jay wants to come on our show, so maybe Jay could come  out with it, Arsenio.  What do you think of that?  Yeah, that'd be good.  I'll make believe.  I don't know.  Sure.  We'll write something up here to make it seem very...  Make it seem...  Awkward and uncomfortable instead of two guys that have known each other for 35 years 
[01:18:30]  just talking.  Come and just talk, yeah.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Somebody who couldn't wait around said, do you guys know what sharking is?  Sharking?  Sharking?  Yes.  I do not know, and I'm kind of mad the guy left.  What's sharking?  I'm talking about day selling.  Oh.  What's sharking?  Sharking is to pull a girl's panties down in public, usually when she's wearing a very short  skirt.  It's very popular in Japan.  Oh, that's...  Yeah, I do know what this is. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, we've seen the videos.  I'm talking about hooking in blue girls or tummy cats.  Can you show me one sharking video?  Sure.  But these are all fake, too.  And it is like a Japanese thing.  Yeah.  The Japanese in their videos.  Oh, boy.  Come on.  This video is called Sharking Rules.  These are all fake.  They're fake.  You can't do this.  It's so weird that the Japanese thing is to, like, create situations where they're faking  that somebody's being victimized. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody always has to be a victim.  Somebody always has to be a victim.  They love a good victim.  Yeah, they're really creepy there.  There's weirdos over there.  They are weirdos over there.  And the video is called Sharking Rules.  No, Sharking doesn't rule.  No.  You shouldn't be doing that to women on the street, especially.  Pulling their panties down.  Why would you do that?  What the fuck is that?  Shouldn't be doing it anywhere, I guess.  That's not a really bad way to say it.  Isn't there another one where someone's jacking off, and then they just, like, right before  they come, they go up to somebody and let go on them? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's more Japanese stuff.  More Japanese stuff.  Right.  That fucking...  Those two bombs really fucked them up.  Like, not physically.  I'm not talking about that.  But just the mental...  What it must do to a nation, mentally, to have another nation drop two atomic bombs on  you, then you wind up pulling girls' panties down in the street.  I guess.  Coming on them on park benches.  Are we playing Prince's new song?  You want to hear it? 
[01:20:30]  Does our audience want to hear it?  I don't know.  Is it any good?  I'm going to say no.  Another guy that hasn't really aged.  Prince.  Yeah.  He's still very little.  He is.  He's a tiny little waif of a guy, isn't he?  Prince is here all night long.  And to get started is his rockin' group who considers themselves...  Oh, God, I hate our song.  So bad.  Performing funk and roll.  Give it up for Third Eye Girl.  Third Eye Blind? 
[01:21:00]  What?  Oh, they're chicks.  What's Third Eye Girl?  It's Prince's group.  Prince's band?  Oh.  What the hell is this?  Is he allowed to say his name these days?  Yeah, he's back to being Prince.  Okay.  That symbol thing was fucked up.  I still got the symbol on his mic stand.  Right.  There we go.  It's called funk and roll.  Oh, there he is.  Got a little afro he's sporting now. 
[01:21:30]  We'll try to get to the hook.  Yeah.  We'll try.  He looks like short little Lenny Kravitz.  Yeah.  That's gotta be a wig, right?  Ah.  There's too much going on with that afro.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  He's gotta be a wig.  It's alright.  Generic.  Kind of like a few Prince songs.  That's alright.  We've got little dancing people behind him.  What do you got to do?  It's not as good as a Batman song.  Bat Dance?  Bat Dance.  Bat Dance was great.  Oh, my shit.  That's one of my favorites.  That was the shit.  Let's say hi to Brian in Wisconsin.  Brian.  Guys.  Hey.  Anthony, you were talking about Japanese being perverts and stuff like that?  Sure. 
[01:22:30]  Haven't you ever listened to Jimmy Tuck at all?  Uh, no, never.  Why?  What?  What?  Just a bit peculiar as well with his, you know.  Jim is not an entire culture.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, you know, there's a whole thing going on over there.  Yeah.  They get weird with their stuff, with their porn and their sexuality.  Joey in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Back to the Japanese videos.  There is a video that I saw where this guy just runs up to a chick in, like, a bus stop 
[01:23:00]  in Japan and just basically jizzes on her head.  Yeah.  They do that.  Jizz videos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then runs away.  And I got to say, I think it was adorable that your call screener did not know what Bukkake  was.  Aww.  Who answered the phone?  Is it Becky?  She hasn't worked with you long enough.  Aww.  She shouldn't be subjected to that type of filth.  Poor Becky.  That's not Becky.  All right.  Let's go to James in Nevada.  I guess he does upskirts.  Uh, James. 
[01:23:30]  Same.  Becky.  Morning, boys.  How are you guys doing today?  Do you really do upskirts?  You're just trying to get on our show.  Actually, yeah, I do them.  Why?  Well, what else do I got to do out here in Nevada?  I don't know.  Um, the secret is a two-man team.  Two-man team.  Yep.  One causes a distraction.  The other one takes the picture.  It's pretty simple.  Slobo!  A little shout-out to Slobo. 
[01:24:00]  Uh, Hayo.  Hayo in Arkansas.  How?  How do you say your name?  Hey, it's How.  It's Al with an H.  How.  How?  Yes, sir.  Well, it's spelled H-A-O on our phones here.  Uh, did you say H-A-O?  H-A-O.  That's how they spelled your name.  That would be completely wrong.  It's H-A-O, sir.  Okay.  What do you got, buddy?  Oh, thank you.  Hey, you were talking about crazy Japanese stuff.  I want you to check out something going on in Japan.  It's called Baby Metal. 
[01:24:30]  One word.  And the video is Give Me Chocolate.  It's kind of hilariously awesome.  Baby Metal.  Give Me Chocolate.  Yeah, check out the video on YouTube.  You'll either laugh or hate it.  All right, let's give this a shot.  Let's give this a shot.  Thank you.  All right.  Here we go.  On Baby Metal.  One of our listeners, which never works.  This never works out, ever.  Never works.  Got to acknowledge that.  Do we eat chocolate?  And a live performance.  Live performance.  It's three Japanese girls. 
[01:25:00]  Looking pretty hot.  And little choreography.  Spanish-looking dresses.  Yeah.  And they got dances all worked out.  Right.  Of course, they got the pigtails high on their head.  They look kind of anime-ish.  Anime.  And all the people in the band are skeletons.  Ah.  I like the sound.  Oh.  Um, do they sing anything? 
[01:25:30]  I love this.  What the hell is...  It sounds like a regular song in fast speed.  Yeah.  Wiggling their butts. 
[01:26:00]  Dances.  Very cute Japanese girls.  Yeah.  I like the music.  You could do something with that.  They're doing funny little dances.  Wow.  Wow.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  They're adorable. 
[01:26:30]  They're crazy over there.  They got a cool sound, I think.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Sam.  Not you, Sam.  Hi.  Sam at South Plainfield.  Sam, what's up?  Yo.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hello.  Hey, just to touch on, like, all these, you know, legislations and rules and even, like, 
[01:27:00]  the sharking videos and all that shit in Japan, did you ever think for a second how fucking  awesome it would be if, like, roles were actually reversed?  Like, how...  Imagine you're at the mall with, like, your girl and you're just waiting on line at Sparrow  for a slice of pizza, just fucking hating life, and, like, a rogue group of girls came, pulled  your pants down, and started jerking you off.  Like, how fucking awesome would that be?  Yeah, guys don't have problems with this stuff, like women do.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:27:30]  Like, it needs...  If a woman flashed me on the subway, I would consider that a great day.  Oh.  You'd be telling your friends.  But, man, women don't like flashers on the subway.  So some vag.  Yeah.  That would make me smile for the rest of the day.  Yeah.  But most women, they run to the police station.  Right.  Yeah, I don't know.  It doesn't work out the same way.  No, no, no.  Guys don't really care, in general, about any of that stuff. 
[01:28:00]  Is that because guys feel like they can control the situation?  Is it because the women feel vulnerable?  I feel like there's a lot of women out there that wouldn't mind seeing a guy flash on the subway.  No, they just don't like it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe we should have an experiment.  Guys wouldn't care, though.  We should do our own experiment.  We do have a guy intern.  Guys and then girls.  Right.  We need a girl to do it in front of, like, guys and see how many fucking guys complain.  Call the cops. 
[01:28:30]  Can you think of a scenario where a woman would absolutely violate your personal space?  Unless it's physical harm.  Right.  You know.  Yeah, well, of course.  But if it's just some kind of masturbatory thing or she squeezes your ass or fucking grabs your dick or something, it's not bothering me.  Nah.  It's not bothering me none.  I don't care.  I'm trying to think. 
[01:29:00]  Fat girl sits on your face.  Yeah, what if she's gross?  Fat girl.  Still wouldn't matter.  I'd laugh.  In a skirt.  No panties.  Smothers your face in public.  Now what do you do?  All right.  That might be a little much.  You know.  Because then, again, it's the harm thing.  There could be some disease over there.  But if she's 20 years old and she's in perfect shape, are you running to the precinct?  Yes.  No, you're right. 
[01:29:30]  I'm not.  That's a double standard.  But why?  I would assume women feel like they're vulnerable.  I don't know.  Yeah, they're being violated.  Right.  Yeah.  And they get mad right away.  Yes, very quickly.  A couple of these pop up on the subway every year.  And it's really funny how the women, they don't take shit, by the way.  I'm not saying they get right in the guy's face.  Right in the face.  They're snapping pictures.  They're fucking yelling.  Calling them a pervert.  Kicking.  Empathetic and all that.  Yeah.  But if the roles were reversed, the guy's just enjoying the show. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  So.  What is this video?  What is this one?  This is an old one.  This is like 10 years old.  And what is it?  It's a bunch of Japanese guys.  And they sing this song.  And they're all wearing just underwear with leaves.  Like with a leaf in front.  Like Adam from the old Adam and Eve.  Right.  This is huge.  Virally like 10 years ago. 
[01:30:30]  I am.  Well, it's not 10 years ago.  Let's say hi to Lady Trucker.  Lady Trucker.  Good morning.  Yeah, the problem with guys that flash is they're just ugly, creepy looking fuckers.  You do know you look like a pig, right?  Wow.  Why are you calling guys creepy looking?  Because the guys that tend to flash are creepy looking ugly fuckers.  How would you guys feel if I was flashing you in the subway?  That would be a problem.  Yeah.  I would not like if you flashed me. 
[01:31:00]  What's with the voice this morning?  Yeah.  It's been out for all week.  I coughed so much it blew my voice out.  You did what?  She coughed so much?  I coughed really hard.  What are you coughing up?  It blew your voice out.  Coughing.  Jesus.  What were you coughing up?  You sick?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Yeah.  Just liquid slime just going down to my nose.  Yeah.  Yee.  This is so fucking sexy.  Yeah, right.  Yee.  You're a disaster. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  Let me, uh, thanks, Lady Trucker.  You're amazing.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, Jen.  I was in a gift store at the mall a couple weeks ago, and I went to the back of the store.  I was looking at something.  This big, fat girl who was sweating profusely looked at me and said, oh, my God, it's so  hot in here, and pulled up her shirt and showed me her big, wet...  Her boobs?  Her big, wet boobs, yeah.  Boobs.  And I just, uh, I looked at her and just walked away.  Yeah.  I tend to not believe you. 
[01:32:00]  I swear.  You swear.  She did that.  I would have said she was hot if I was lying.  Right.  Yeah.  Huh.  Flavo!  Another flavo.  Are you the same guy?  No.  Oh, okay.  Baby metal girls really do dance around.  Very energetic-like.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jay in Pennsylvania.  Jay.  Yo.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, that guy was so full of shit.  Uh-huh.  Oh, the one we just had on?  Yeah.  Yeah, I believe so. 
[01:32:30]  Okay.  It just doesn't happen to guys.  No.  It just doesn't happen.  It doesn't.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  It wouldn't matter.  There's an awesome video on YouTube called I Was Robbed by Two Men.  It's learning, uh, it's Japanese people learning how to speak English through exercise.  You gotta go forward a little bit.  Oh, boy.  It sounds like a lot of work.  Why are we doing this?  It sounds like a lot of work.  You're giving us too much work.  How far into the video before it gets good?  I think it's like, uh, it's like a half a minute. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Let's give it a shot.  All right.  Thank you.  You know what?  No.  You know, you know.  Good for you.  No.  This is 99% of the videos that I get links to from people.  You gotta see this.  Right.  I click on it, and I'm angry.  Angry with whoever sent it.  It's like, why would I watch this?  Why would you think I would find this entertaining? 
[01:33:30]  It's terrible.  Hey, guy, that just called, saying, this is awful.  Yeah.  We're gonna regroup here.  That's what we're gonna do.  This is a video.  We did good, though.  What video is this?  This is a 10-hour loop of Japanese girls singing, I have a bad case of diarrhea.  Oh, yeah.  This one rules.  We're gonna break with this.  Oh.  Do you remember this one?  Case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea. 
[01:34:00]  They love shit.  This goes on for 10 hours.  10 hours.  Yeah.  10 hours straight.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I'd love to see the statistics of how long the average person lasts.  Yeah, I stayed on listening.  10 hours?  You think so?  Yeah.  You think anyone has made it all the way to the end?  Sure.  You think?  Yeah.  Just to say they did it?  Yep.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  Just leave it on in the background at home. 
[01:34:30]  They do acid and then watch this for the whole 10 hours.  Just staring at it.  All right.  We're gonna take a break.  We got Joey Diaz.  I think he might be on the show next or very, very soon.  It's Mad Flavor on Twitter.  Nice.  One of Joe Rogan's pals.  He's been on our show before.  It's just been a while.  A long time.  A lot of people excited that Joey Diaz is here today.  Also, Adam Farrar is stopping in.  And our pal Jim Jeffery is calling from California.  Certainly.  The new season of Legit is right around the corner, right? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  All right.  A little more of this and then we'll break.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea. 
[01:35:30]  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea. 
[01:36:00]  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea. 
[01:36:30]  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea. 
[01:37:00]  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea. 
[01:37:30]  Diarrhea.  We're 10 minutes into this.  That's it?  It's 10 hours, right?  Yeah, we'll get there.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  They love shit over there.  Tub girl.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  Case of diarrhea.  Are the girls really saying that?  Yeah.  They're learning English, eh?  Come on.  But it's kind of wacky to learn. 
[01:38:00]  Man, they have flat asses.  What's that about?  I don't know.  Don't they walk like we do?  It's just a weird thing.  Maybe they just don't have staircases in Japan.  It's not 100% either, flat asses.  But it's very high percentage.  Right, why?  I don't know.  Just walking around makes that ass look a little better, right?  Yeah.  I saw a recent picture of Mila Kunis, who we have said has no ass for many years.  And she had an ass. 
[01:38:30]  I think there was some trickery going on.  I think they do that butt implants.  Why?  Really?  Yeah, Vice did a whole documentary on the butt implants.  How good would it look like that?  Because she, like, it was barely wearing a little thong thing.  It looked really good.  They actually put implants in.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Vice rules, man.  Everything about them rules.  Their Twitter account rules.  Their YouTube account rules.  You could kind of tell.  Their website.  You could kind of tell, though, like tit implants.  You can't tell. 
[01:39:00]  Like that one.  There's the one where she's leaning against the wall.  Go down, go down, go down.  Down one more level.  To the, to the, there.  Right there.  Okay.  Look.  Yeah, man.  She looks great there.  That is a great picture of her.  That's tiny.  Yeah, but it's there.  I betcha that's airbrushed.  You think?  I betcha the airbrushed.  Maybe.  Something doesn't look right.  That highlight, that light highlight right there does a lot.  She's standing on her toes.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have a bad case of diarrhea. 
[01:39:30]  Oh.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  Because she got zero ass in a lot of the other pictures.  Yeah.  She's a very cute girl, though.  She's not without makeup.  Yeah.  Have you seen that one?  Yeah, of course we all have.  Yeah, of course we all have.  On Facebook.  Oh, here, what, what, uh, Hollywood street address are you?  I'm fine.  What?  Oh, that's all Facebook is now.  Oh, what character from Breaking Bad are you?  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm Walter White. 
[01:40:00]  I'm Walt Junior.  Oh.  What type of string are you?  I'm twine.  They've gotten just all these, it's all there is.  I got a bad case of diarrhea.  It's that and, and, and then you gotta deal with this.  No.  Oh, our good friend of 15 years is gone.  Little Snuggles.  Oh.  We had to take Little Snuggles and put him to sleep today. 
[01:40:30]  And then the 150, uh, comments, so sorry to hear about your loss.  You know, remember the good times with, it's all it is now.  Social media has shown that we just don't have anything to talk about.  Nothing.  We really don't.  Diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  Every time I go to Facebook now, all I wanna do is cancel my account.  Really?  And, and throw it away.  It's, there's nothing on there that I, I scroll through. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  I see what a couple of my friends are doing and it's like, oh, this, that.  Big shit.  And for the most part, it's just, check this out, holy shit!  And it's a video you know, you've seen two, three years ago.  Yeah.  That you know is fake.  Holy shit!  I, um, I love Facebook as far as promoting my dumb stuff.  Yeah?  Yeah, I get way more attention off my Facebook page than Twitter when, if I have a video or  something. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  I, I put a link on my Facebook page, it, it does way better than if I tweet it.  Yeah.  Way better.  Look, the water slide guy is, uh, launching on a ramp and going into a pool.  I have.  Fucking two hundred yards away.  That's cool.  Oh really, is it?  Yeah, that's cool, right?  Well, it's great CGI, yeah.  Diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  What's your Facebook page?  Mine?  I guess just Anthony Cumia.  Nice.  Yeah, I think so.  I had to add fans onto the end of mine.  Did ya?  OP Radio fans.  Ah. 
[01:42:00]  Oh.  And notice the fans part.  Yeah.  You hating assholes.  Oh boy.  It says fans.  So if you're not a fan, show you're not a fan by not going there.  Yeah.  We need to save these animals.  Uh.  What animals?  I don't know.  But then there's a video of some fucking three dead dogs in a dumpster.  Ah.  I wanna see it.  I don't wanna see it.  Of diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea. 
[01:42:30]  Oh diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  This goes on and on, doesn't it?  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I wanna talk about it some after the break, but now this song fucked me up.  Oh yeah.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  Let me take a sip out of my health shake, and then maybe I'll remember.  Your what?  My health shake.  God, I outdid myself this morning with my health shake.  I don't remember it being called that.  It's the same thing as before. 
[01:43:00]  It's my health shake.  It comes in a nice cup.  In a Nutribullet.  I don't know what you're talking about.  This is my health shake.  Did you put a boost in it?  I did.  You got to put a nice boost in your health shake.  Trouble in paradise?  Yeah, because that sounds like a Nutribullet.  It also looks the same.  What are you talking about?  It's literally the same cup you've always been using.  It's my health shake.  What'd you make it in?  I outdid myself, though.  It's kale, spinach, pineapple, mango, oatmeal, and flaxseed, and a half a banana. 
[01:43:30]  That's like a double boost.  What?  You'll be singing this later.  When I drink my health shakes, the poo flows the next day.  This turns into poo, which is weird.  I love my health shake.  What's the matter?  No envelopes?  Yeah.  Are you waiting for it?  I'm a free agent.  I've decided to become a free agent.  You can't get paid.  I'm not getting the respect I deserve.  You're not supposed to be paid under the table to mention products on the air. 
[01:44:00]  That's called payola.  I'm not mentioning a product, am I?  This is my health shake.  What about Dr. Ian Smith's malt shop 1950s fucking blender?  You're going to push that one?  Oh, Dr. Ian Smith.  Oh, Dr. Ian Smith.  When we saw his blender, with all the great blenders out there, I'm like, what are you  doing?  What is he doing?  I'm not sure.  Maybe we didn't see the...  I know.  No?  Logistically, it didn't look like one of those blenders that...  Where you twist off the blades for easy cleaning? 
[01:44:30]  The blades are way down there where you've got to twist your hand like you're fisting  and get it down in there and clean under the blades, and it's impossible.  That's why no one wanted to make their health shakes.  Uh-huh.  Because the old school blenders were a pain in the ass.  Just a pain.  Right.  You go right from the blender to the cup.  Same thing.  What are you doing, man?  What happened to our song?  The diarrhea never stops.  Oh.  On the O.V. and Anthony channel.  I see.  Is that it?  Yes. 
[01:45:00]  We only stop the diarrhea twice an hour.  People want to know if we saw the hoverboard with Tony Hawk and Christopher Lloyd.  Yeah, another example of dumb people thinking that was real.  Tony Hawk actually, what did he put out some kind of a half-assed apology or something,  saying, I didn't think anyone would think that was real.  Yeah.  Well, people think it's real.  People really think there are hoverboards?  A lot of people think it's real.  Yeah.  Where's the commercial?  Let's see this.  The other thing.  Right.  Tony Hawk rides a Back to the Future hoverboard. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  No, he doesn't.  A little street.  And here comes the DeLorean.  Right.  Not the Back to the Future one, just your standard DeLorean.  Okay.  Yeah, there's no Mr. Fission on the back of this one.  No, no, no.  Is Christopher Lloyd going to get out?  No lights.  I'm Christopher Lloyd.  Yes, he is.  And about 25 years ago, I played Dr. Emmett Brown in the film Back to the Future 2.  Right.  A landmark film that, amongst other things, introduced the concept of hoverboards to the world. 
[01:46:00]  Now, at the time, as much as we all wanted hoverboards to be real, of course, it was an impossibility.  But I'm proud to announce that thanks to the clever folks with HoverTech, the technology has caught up with the concept.  This is very well done.  Right, of course.  And people are dumb.  What is this, like a Funny or Die or something? 
[01:46:30]  Yes.  Christopher Lloyd, he's come with this big case that's like Biff had.  Right.  Handing over the hoverboard to Tony Hawk.  Tony Hawk opens up the case.  So if it really was a hoverboard, he's going to ride it for the first time and there's not going to be problems figuring it out?  No, it's going to be great.  I can't believe how well it works.  I really, I didn't think it'd be that smooth.  You know, it always looked in the movies like it was just awkward.  They didn't get a pit bull sideways.  No.  You can't go on water.  Well.  You know what you need for water. 
[01:47:00]  Unless you got power.  Adam and skate fans started skating because of that move.  Tony Hawk is boring.  Current pros.  Yeah.  I know he makes a lot of money and stuff, but he's a bore too.  Yeah.  I never found him interesting.  Anyone could enjoy it.  We invited a few other friends to try out the board.  Most of whom had little or no experience skateboarding.  Moby.  Awkward.  I thought there'd be a lot of money for, like, exposing her.  Look at Moby's head.  Very Charlie Brownish.  When you start riding it, you know what to do.  Look at the people.  No precedent for this. 
[01:47:30]  It is real.  He's floating.  It's got to be real.  Then again, I'm baffled by most technology.  Look who's riding it now.  Shaq Balloon.  Oh, look who it is.  Terrell.  Terrell.  How does he want his name?  You said Terrell, and he said it's Terrell.  He's another asshole.  Who else is in this?  I didn't believe it.  Schoolboy Q.  I don't know, Schoolboy Q.  He's the hot shit right now.  Why?  Because he's what it is.  He's got one of those nigga songs. 
[01:48:00]  You're not dangerous this would be.  What?  It's not how they're described.  I guarantee Schoolboy Q has one of those songs.  They say that a lot.  I'm bored with this.  Yeah.  This could have been a very cool thing.  Yeah.  It's boring.  It's long as shit.  How long is it?  It's like four and a half minutes long.  Oh, really?  So now Tony Hawk is using it?  No, that's Moby.  Moby.  How are they all so amazing?  They think it's real.  So what's the deal with this video?  It was sent to you a lot? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, I got this a lot.  And what was the...  I get this along with the people that go, hey, look, today was the day in Back to the Future  when Marty went to the future.  And then they just have the digital readout of today's date.  Right.  Someone's saying, well, Steve's got some info on this.  Steve.  Yes.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi.  Hey, you actually can see the crane in this video, like, for two seconds.  Somewhere in the video, you see the actual crane that's lifting people up. 
[01:49:00]  You only see the wheels on the tires, but you can easily tell it's a crane.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why wouldn't they cut that out?  They were a bunch of silly geese.  I guess it was a good shot.  Silly geese.  You're right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good one.  Let me say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  I'm shaking.  What's up, buddy?  I'm shaking.  The hoverboard thing, people actually thought it was real.  I don't want to live on this planet anymore.  They did.  A lot of people thought it was absolutely real.  Yeah, but my point is, fucking Facebook went to do it.  No. 
[01:49:30]  No.  It went to spew it.  It's like surrounded by stupid people.  Like, there wouldn't be a dancer.  It's angry.  It's a fucking break society.  He's trying to be a character.  I'm going to go drive over.  Yeah, he's trying to get John.  He's trying to be a character.  He's trying to be a character, I think.  Oh, you mean this guy?  Hey, uh, John.  That motherfucker's stealing my character.  He's trying.  He was trying.  He was trying to steal your character, John.  But it's not a character.  You're the real deal, John.  Yeah, we know you're the guy.  You were a big hit yesterday on the show.  Yeah.  Did you see...  Yeah, I was going to call in earlier, but I was, like, tired. 
[01:50:00]  And I didn't know if I would be here today.  But I said, fuck it.  I'll call in.  Did you see the movie Her again?  No, I did not.  I should watch it again.  But I actually got a question.  Oh.  Do you...  Would it be...  Well, do you think it's creepy or would it have been funny?  I was around the area of Anthony's house and I had the DVDs on me.  I was going to put it in his mailbox last night.  You had a stalker, you know.  That would have been a little creepy.  It would have been creepy?  Yeah, because I'd have looked in there. 
[01:50:30]  I'd have looked in there and been like, what the fuck are these doing in there?  And I'd have wondered, you know.  Yeah, I think that would have been creepy.  Then I would have checked my cams and I'd have seen somebody walk up to the mailbox and  put it in.  And then...  Yeah, you would have seen my little scrawny ass.  Then I would have blown up the picture and posted it on Twitter and said, anyone know  who the fuck this is?  And then you'd have probably said, oh, that's me.  And then I said, don't come by my house again or you'll get shot. 
[01:51:00]  End of story.  Well, I would have just tried to keep the bit going of whatever.  No, you don't have to keep the bit going.  Just be yourself and we'll see what happens.  Yeah.  I'll just mail it to the studio.  It's always bad when people try to keep a bit going.  Yeah.  I don't even remember what videos he was talking about.  Tell you the truth.  The horror DVD.  Why do I need that?  I'm sorry, you watch it.  I don't want to watch it.  What do you think?  You're going to fucking drop it off?  Here's a scenario.  I catch him putting it in the mailbox.  Hey, what are you doing? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, it's the horror DVD.  I'm fucking Combative John.  Remember from the show?  Oh, hey, come on.  Come on in.  We'll watch it together.  Look, there's Beavis.  He's the famous Beavis.  You can pet him if you want.  You want a beer?  Fast forward.  You guys are just jerking each other off.  Just jacking.  In the theater, right?  In the theater, he says.  In the theater, right?  Yeah, it's okay if it's in the theater.  Right.  Yeah.  Get the jacuzzi going.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever. 
[01:52:00]  It's going to be a nice weekend.  Hey, 50 degrees.  Wow, jacuzzi weather.  John, I've got to let you go because we've got someone that thought the hoverboard thing  was real.  Oh, come on.  I've got to talk to someone that thinks this is real.  Thanks, John.  Nicole in Orlando.  Girls.  Hi.  Hi.  What's wrong with you?  Girls are really kind of stupid.  You guys are gullible.  God, I know.  I was so embarrassed.  I showed my fiance.  I'm like, do you think this is real?  He's like, are you serious?  Are you serious? 
[01:52:30]  Do you know?  Honestly.  Do you know the fucking amazing turn of events for the world that the ability to have  a hoverboard would make for the world?  Maybe it was wishful thinking.  Commerce, shipping, fucking transportation.  It would be huge.  What about the learning curve?  Right.  These guys all jump on it and they can ride it properly?  Wouldn't there be a learning curve?  I don't know.  One was an athlete.  I don't know. 
[01:53:00]  What's it powered by?  How does it work?  I don't know.  Don't you know there's no way to combat gravity like that without immense amounts of power,  magnetism, freezing temperatures?  There's a way to do it, but there's no economical way to make one of those.  I've got to make this statement.  Girls need penises so they can be smarter.  They really do.  Unfortunately, we wouldn't want them then because then they have the penis. 
[01:53:30]  Embarrassingly enough, I'm a pretty smart girl.  Well, for a girl, I bet you are.  For a girl.  But that vagina.  For a girl out of Orlando, you must be a rocket scientist.  You know those games where you've got to build your character and you're like, okay,  I'll give them this much charisma, I'll give them this much strength, but now I don't  have enough points so I've got to cut back on this.  That vagina takes up so many points when building a female that you don't have much left for  things like, you know, common sense, brains, patience, fucking the vagina. 
[01:54:00]  All right, Nicole.  At least she's brave enough to call and say that she thought it was real.  Yeah.  I respect that.  There are hovercrafts, so it can't be too far-fetched.  Hovercrafts!  There can't be hoverboards.  Would you stop it?  What about the hover golf cart?  Hover golf cart?  Who was it?  Was it Bubba Watson?  Yeah.  Is that the one with...  It's forced air underneath a vehicle with a curtain? 
[01:54:30]  Is that it?  I don't remember now.  We played it on our show.  A hovercraft is just air underneath something, a cushion of air.  That's not a hoverboard type.  A hovercraft golf cart would rule.  But we haven't heard anything about it since.  That video popped up.  So I think he was going for the goof, too, right?  Full of baloney.  It had to be.  Or we'd be talking about it every day.  Every damn day.  You see that Christopher Lloyd, he posted a video afterwards saying he was duped. 
[01:55:00]  It's another goof video.  It's another goof video, right?  You don't.  No, he's boring.  I was duped.  Yeah?  We had him in studio.  I know.  He's a nice guy.  Oh.  I see him almost every day.  He's a nice guy.  You do, huh?  Yeah.  Down in your neighborhood?  Jim.  Yeah.  He's one of the gym guys.  At the gym?  He works out down at the gym?  I see him.  I see a lot of Tony Denza.  Marty!  Used to see Regis.  Yeah?  With his old man muscles pumping a lot of iron.  Nice.  He's got an old man body that's, like, all pumped up. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Doesn't look right.  And he's an asshole.  He does not want to be bothered.  He's an angry guy.  Yeah, he's not the nice guy you see on TV.  He's totally different.  Well, that's just that you don't see him on TV either, so he's even more angry.  He's so not approachable when he's not.  Oh, God.  He's completely different.  Michio Kaku is on CNN.  We plug in, and then all of a sudden...  What are physicists making the rounds these days?  You were supposed to have them. 
[01:56:00]  Well, that's the goal.  We're not there yet, but for animal studies, we can actually do that.  When animals learn certain skills, we record the memory, and then we reinsert that memory  back into what it's called the hippocampus of the brain, and the animals learn it just  like that.  How do you...  What is it that you're inserting that is the memory?  Well, when we learn this task in the hippocampus, in the center of the brain, electrical activity  surges in what is called the hippocampus.  That is your memory organ.  We record it.  Cauliflower?  It's like you videotape something.  We record the impulses. 
[01:56:30]  Triangle.  Triangle.  So the impulses have a specific pattern or makeup that are unique to that particular memory.  Right.  We record it.  Everyone likes trying to sound smart when you talk to these guys, by the way.  You try to sound concise.  Right.  You use a few words that might be a little larger than your normal vocabulary.  I'm guilty of the same thing.  You just feel compelled to like, oh, look, I made them think I was smart for a second.  Do you think they ever think that you might be on their level? 
[01:57:00]  No, because everyone talks to them like that.  Yeah.  You pull out two or three words that you learned years ago that means something important.  Or you just repeat what they said.  That's what you're saying.  Yes.  So what you're trying to tell everybody, and then they go, yes, exactly.  And you go, hi, I'm so smart.  I'm so smart.  Maybe he thinks I'm smart.  He doesn't.  I just remembered something.  Yeah.  Do you mind?  No.  All right.  Thank God you don't mind.  Not at all.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, okay. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, phew.  All right.  Oh, no.  Is this a cold call?  Is it your rock's number?  No, I just remembered something.  Can't wait to find out who it is.  Opie and Anthony.  Paul A.  You're on the air.  You're awake this early.  I thought I would have to leave another message for you.  What are you telling me he's on the air?  No, I don't know.  I'm in the air.  He's on the air. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, he's on the air, buddy.  He knows.  I just went by my office to pick up my phone charger, which I left here.  Are you in L.N.?  More exciting news for your listeners.  Well, I was thinking about you because yesterday I went and saw the Muppets movie with my young  children.  It's the new one with Ricky Gervais and the evil Kermit.  I haven't seen you yet.  Tell me.  It was pretty good.  I liked it a lot, but I was very mad because they only played a snippet of Rainbow Connection. 
[01:58:30]  Why I ought to...  How could they...  How could they ignore something that I wrote 408 years ago?  Now, you're still going to get the check, right?  You know what?  We can start a move, but, you know, what we need to do is give Rainbow Connection its own  Twitter account, like, you know, like Pharrell to have, and see what happens.  Well, I think they should have you singing the song in all these movies, Paul.  Well, this is why, you know, why when the phone rings, that if I'm awake, if I'm even 
[01:59:00]  close awake, even my unconscious will go, ah, it's hoping that you better pick it up, because  this is family now, you know?  It really is.  It really is.  It really is.  I'm just looking out for you.  I'm mad they only used a snippet of Rainbow Connection.  Yeah, well, you know, the rat bastards, what can I tell you?  It's just, you know, sometimes stealth can be heartless.  Yeah.  Are you still hanging out with those robots?  You know what?  We picked up that night's award together, and I was meeting with them later. 
[01:59:30]  I want to get back into, you know, we're on the West Coast.  I'm going to meet with the guys and talk about something else, but at this point, I'm just,  you know, we're writing Pan's Labyrinth for the stage with Guillermo del Toro.  And Gustavo Santo, Elias, writing the music.  I'm writing the words.  And then the main thing that I'm really, well, just finishing up is, you know, Tracy Jackson  and I are writing a book called Gratitude and Trust.  Recovery is not just for addicts. 
[02:00:00]  And it'll be out in September.  So when that book comes out, I want to come over and drag my friend Tracy, who's this really  brilliant lady, and sit her down with you guys.  I want to tell you, if you can't take advantage of your friends, who can you take advantage of?  Brilliant.  It is brilliant.  All right, Paul.  Love you, miss you.  Talk to you soon.  Talk to you soon.  Oh, jeez.  See, now he's going to think there's a problem.  Why?  Well, you just kind of hung up on him.  He said, love you, miss you, but... 
[02:00:30]  Should we call him back?  Probably not.  Oh, we should?  I think it would be harassment at some point.  Why?  When does it turn into bullying?  He was probably bullied a lot.  Oh, you're going to say, uh...  Problem with the phone?  That old gag?  Someday you'll find a rainbow...  Hello?  Paul.  Anthony feels like I might have hung up on you there.  I didn't mean it to sound like a hang-up. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, no, no, I didn't at all.  No, no, no, I didn't at all.  It did not sound like a hang-up, but no.  All right.  No, you guys are...  Listen, you guys are...  On my Instagram, I did a thing about the other day about the Nerdist podcast.  I said, you know, you've only got...  I'm 164,283 followers away from kicking your ass, Chris Hardwick.  And Opie and Anthony, you're next.  Whoa!  Oh, man.  Nice.  I like that.  I got to follow you on Instagram. 
[02:01:30]  One of these followers, I've got like nine.  You know, it's just funny to Instagram, you know, so...  Oh, come on.  And then I think I put, as a hash mark, I put something loving and like you guys...  Love you, miss you.  Love you, miss you.  So kind of, I appreciate it.  Yeah.  What's your Instagram?  Let's get you some followers today.  Oh, Instagram is PaulieLama2.  P-A-U-L-I-E-L-A-M-A-2.  And the Twitter is...  I am the letter I, the letter M, Paul Williams.  You guys are amazing. 
[02:02:00]  What did I do?  What did I do?  I don't know, Paul.  We just love you.  And of course, miss you.  When it's summertime, we're playing golf, right?  I would love to.  I'm going to take you up on that.  That would be good.  That's what you need to do that.  I mean, that's what you need to do.  That's what you need to do.  That's what you need to do.  The full payoff of the friendship.  That's what I know.  You're going to see my golf.  You're going to see my golf.  You're going to see my golf.  Yeah, I hear you.  All right.  All right, Paul.  If there's anything, if the flash should be right back at you guys.  If there's anything I can do, you need me to show up for some charity because 
[02:02:30]  you're somewhere like that thing.  I never fail to ask.  If I can do it, I'll be there.  I appreciate it.  Thank you, Paul.  Thank you, Paul.  You got it, guys.  Have a great day.  Yeah, let's hang up proper now.  Thank you.  Love you, Michelle.  Proper.  All right.  Bye.  Proper hang up.  His little golf clubs.  That would be adorable.  I keep saying he wants to play golf.  I got to do it.  It would look like that Dorf.  Hey, we got Joey Diaz walking down the hall.  So why don't we take it?  Oh, there he is.  We'll take a quick break, and we'll get Joey on the show next. 
[02:03:00]  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Got that right.  Oh, yeah.  Heading toward the weekend.  Yeah.  Where's Joey?  Joey Diaz is here.  Yeah, where are they?  Did he go to take a piss or something?  Maybe.  Take a piss.  Look at Vince.  Young Vince right there.  In the corner.  We were watching some of the new WWE network that they got, because Sam subscribed to him.  Hey, Joey.  How you doing, man?  Yeah, take a seat.  Whichever one you want there, Joey.  Watching the Brooklyn Brawler and Kamala go at it from 93. 
[02:03:30]  Look at Young Vince.  Good old Young Vince McMahon.  With his pompadour hairdo and stuff.  And a red bow tie.  Yeah, ready to do the interview.  That's right.  The post-match interview.  Wow.  What's up, Joey?  What's up, guys?  How you been?  Thank you very much for having me.  Well, you're kissing me.  It's been a while, right?  No, it's been a long time.  What was that about?  Who the fuck?  You had a problem with us?  No.  I'm kidding.  I mean, I get it.  You know, whenever I come to town, I don't know who to call.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know who to even, you know.  And then I come, I go, fuck, I should have called Dopey.  Where do you live? 
[02:04:00]  L.A.?  Los Angeles.  Yeah, you're in L.A.  Yeah, so I didn't know, you know.  Yeah.  Well, I talk to Jimmy.  I see Jimmy at different, you know, UFCs.  Uh-huh.  Right.  You know.  Well, we're back now.  Yeah, no, we're back.  We're back together finally.  I'm happy.  Great to see you guys.  Twitter's very excited that you're doing our show today.  Yeah, I'm very excited.  Very cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone told me to mention ranch dressing.  Oh, I fucking hate ranch dressing.  They said if you just mention ranch dressing, Joey will just have something to say about you.  Oh, I just hate it.  I just don't know where it came from.  Reason? 
[02:04:30]  No?  Just don't like it?  No, no.  I'll tell you what the real reason is.  You go to these places and you go, let me get an order of wings.  And when it comes to blue cheese, nah.  When it comes to ranch, let me get blue cheese.  We don't have blue cheese.  How the fuck do you have blue cheese?  Then you shouldn't be serving wings.  Then you shouldn't be serving wings.  That was my argument.  And when you, you know, some places in like Orange County, California just served ranch dressing.  I'm like, and then.  That sounds like a very Orange County, California thing.  Yeah, yeah, it drives me crazy.  So that's why I just took offense to it.  All right, you don't have, you don't, you offer me ranch.  That's cool. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, you don't have ranch.  All right.  Now give me the blue cheese.  No, we don't.  If you have the blue cheese, I won't get pissed off.  Right.  But for you just to say, I don't have blue cheese, that just sets me the fuck off.  That's no disrespect to Buffalo, New York.  That's cheap.  But it's all these places that have to make like wings their own.  Their own thing.  Just stay with the original recipe.  Everyone loves it.  We've decided we love Buffalo wings.  You don't have to do the honey barbecue, honey, whatever the hell.  What is it?  Honey mustard, sweet and sour.  I do like a good barbecued wing. 
[02:05:30]  I like a good teriyaki wing.  No, they're not bad.  But that's not, but it's not a Buffalo wing.  But it's under the guys that it's Buffalo wings.  No.  They do that to you.  Oh, we make our Buffalo wings different.  Well, then don't call them Buffalo wings, because they're not Buffalo wings.  I lived in Buffalo for three years.  They're not.  Yeah, you started real big up there.  Ah, well, sure.  Rochester, Buffalo, something like that.  Bold places.  I was huge.  Oh, that's right.  Wee's.  What's his name?  Brother Wee's rules.  Brother Wee's.  You should do a show, man.  I do. 
[02:06:00]  I do.  That's the connection.  Okay.  That's the connection.  I remember him telling me that's right.  That's the connection.  I learned this radio thing from Wee's big time.  Big time.  No one else really.  Maybe the influence here and there, but Wee's really funny.  What years were you up there in Buffalo?  Oh, God.  Um, pushing late 80s.  They don't fuck around up there.  Late 80s in Rochester, early 90s in Buffalo.  Okay.  Yeah, they don't mess around up there.  That's cold weather up there, Jack.  Yeah.  That's the home of Rick James.  That guy didn't fuck around either.  Yeah, he knew. 
[02:06:30]  Your old Rick James.  You know how to keep warm.  He lived on the fruit fucking.  Yes, he did.  Firing up that pipe.  I saw him years later at the Comedy Store, like just in front of the Comedy Store one night,  and I almost died.  Yeah.  I think I thought he was clean.  He obviously was.  Obviously, yeah.  I thought he was with some fucking chick, and I didn't even shake his hand.  I'm just seeing him.  I was like, fuck it.  That's good enough.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We had him on.  Yeah, we did.  I just remember that.  We had him on at WNEW.  We had a good time with him.  When he was fucking Linda Blair, it's like, oh, my God. 
[02:07:00]  What the fuck is she doing?  That's all I could think was, what the fuck?  That means Anthony had a crush on Linda Blair, by the way.  Oh, who didn't?  Come on.  Growing up.  That was a bummer to you, huh?  Oh, my God.  About the same age and shit like that.  So you would with her through The Exorcist, and then the prison movies, and shit like that.  All that hot fucking caged heat, whatever it was.  And then it's like, oh, yeah, here she is with her boyfriend, Rick James.  I'm just like, ah, fuck. 
[02:07:30]  What happened to Linda Blair?  Where was that poor?  Exactly.  See what happened?  I don't know.  She does those Comic-Cons.  Got all fucked out by Rick James, and that was it.  He fucked her out.  He was fucking those bitches up.  Making them smoke crack.  Three fingers in their pussy.  Yanking that monkey up.  When you pick them up by the hoof like that.  And you hit them in the face with your cock.  That's a...  Because see, there's fucking, and then there's coke fucking.  Right, coke fucking.  That's where you get evil. 
[02:08:00]  You got a towel on, and a fucking gun in your underwear, and you got a knife in your fucking  shoe, and you're eating pussy, but you're pulling her hair.  It's fucking disgusting.  Nothing better than fucking dog and a chick, and having to peek out the window every two  seconds because you think the cops are coming.  Oh, go look out the window, you dirty bitch.  Rub Bengay on her feet.  Oh, torture those motherfuckers.  When you snort coke with a freak, they know.  And especially once it comes to the last half gram, they got to work for every fucking  line.  Yeah.  They're sniffing your ass hole. 
[02:08:30]  They're doing everything.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  There's nothing really anyone can trade for that last half gram.  It's hysterical how I haven't done blow in seven years.  And sometimes, like, you know, I'm 51, I'm done.  But you look at a chick, and you're like, oh, she would have been fun with a package.  She would have been good.  Because without a package, I don't see it.  But with a good coke package, where you know you let them piss on you and get all fucking  evil and shit.  There's nothing like a chick pissing on you in the shower.  Tremendous.  These are just tremendous.  Guy in Dallas used to call that whore bait.  Oh. 
[02:09:00]  No, it is.  There's a difference in picking up a woman than going up to a woman and going, listen.  Guy in radio in Dallas used to get the hottest girls.  And I asked him one day.  He goes, it's because of this.  He showed me.  It's the whore bait.  She could be at a fucking restaurant with Brad Pitt talking about three black kids in  Uganda, and you cut them right off with a package.  You just come right in and fucking waving that thing, and they'll look at you.  At least you got their attention.  You know what it is?  I'm an ugly dude, but with Blah, I was fucking Elvis.  I don't give a fuck.  I'd show up in that room.  I had a 12-foot dick, because I got a rock of coke, and I could front. 
[02:09:30]  So we'll get this party started, baby.  When you think about how much you wanted coke back when you were doing coke, how much you  wanted a fucking, especially like the last bits run out, and all you're thinking about  is getting more coke.  Now you think you're a girl, and you got a fucking pussy that is exactly a one-for-one  trade ratio with Blah.  It doesn't seem fair.  It doesn't seem fair, but if you're the guy with the coke, of course you're getting laid. 
[02:10:00]  And I used to get creepy, because towards the end, I would hold on to it.  Let's say I didn't know if you were going to suck my dick.  I wouldn't give you the good shit.  I'd cut it with aspirin.  I'm a fucking dirty bastard.  I'd get bare aspirin.  I'd cut him and put him in aluminum foil.  And I'd work the whole thing.  I'd do a little bump and give it to her.  Once I realized she was all in, then she got the good stuff.  Got some of the good stuff.  Fucking, I'm a dirty, that's dirty shit.  Do you miss it?  It's been seven years.  No, no, not like that.  And now it's a different life now. 
[02:10:30]  I started in 79 here.  This hit this area like a fucking bomb.  Nobody remembers what cocaine.  You know, cocaine wasn't a drug that you did to get fucked up.  It was a state.  It pumped you up.  If you came out of a bathroom, you were VIP.  Oh, look at him.  He's got blow.  Yeah, he's doing blow.  And people come up to you and go, how does it taste?  How cool is it?  It leveled you.  It made you.  It was like wearing fucking socks.  You know those fucking idiots now that all have glasses on? 
[02:11:00]  They all put glasses on to be cool.  Like, these are for me to fucking read.  Not for me because I'm a blind fuck.  Not for me to be cool to look smart.  That's what cocaine did.  It raised you a class.  It raised you up a few points.  It raised you up a few points.  So that's how it got sucked in.  And it just, you know, I remember going to 135th Street, going to Amsterdam, right to  the Dominicans, and going in the back, and, you know, at 3 in the morning.  Were you ever scared up there?  Never.  Never?  Never.  You ever had a problem?  Well, because they needed you to come back, I guess.  Yes, right? 
[02:11:30]  And the neighborhood, I remember going into that.  It was better if you came back instead of just robbing you right there.  Yeah, that parking garage on 181st Street.  We'd go in, like you were going to park, and you went up to the top, and it was a fucking  club.  Wow.  It was an actor-hour.  What do you mean?  Wait, wait.  It's an old parking?  An old parking right off, when you come in from the bridge into, from Jersey into the  city, you go, you cop, and then on 181st Street, like, there used to be a parking  garage there, and you'd go in the parking garage, and you were going to park, and you  go to the top floor, and it was a fucking club.  Cards, women, and the cops just left that stuff alone back then. 
[02:12:00]  No, no.  You know, it was a different city.  It was a complete different city, and it's very hard to explain to people who live here  now.  Well, maybe someday soon, with de Blasio in there, it'll get back to where it is.  You guys are hating on him, correct?  I don't like him.  I think he's full of shit.  I don't think the city was as fucking, in such a bad shape that his whole pitch when he's  running for mayor is how, I'm going to turn this city around and change.  It's like, the city's fine.  It's making a boatload of money. 
[02:12:30]  It's never been cleaner and safer to walk around in.  What really needs to be changed around?  You know, yeah, income inequity?  Sorry.  Welcome to the fucking world.  That's how I feel about it.  Yeah, we're doing all right.  Yeah.  I would love to see some of the porn theaters come back, though, and some of that dirty taxi  driver-looking fucking streets.  A little dirt.  A little dirt.  The city needs a little dirt.  A little bit.  A little bit.  They still have a few peep shows, like Peep World and all that.  They pushed them all the way out.  They pushed them all the way out. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Do you remember that shit?  It was everywhere.  We used to love coming to the city in high school to just walk around.  We were little suburbanites.  We were out on Long Island, so coming to the city was like an adventure.  You went to a peep show, you walk in, and it will all be early.  Let's say you cut school at eight.  You come over like nine.  You get a hot dog.  You went to Peep World, and it'll all be Hasidic Jews walking in.  A lot of fucking his seeds.  They like that little pussy in the round.  Then you walk in and have like the little buckets.  You see like the little Puerto Rican dudes with the buckets that clean the thing out. 
[02:13:30]  Cleaning the jizz.  You went in there, and then they had the two types.  They had the glass where you could pop your head through the glass and see the action.  Then they had the bulletproof glass.  Right, right.  Remember the day we did that?  Yeah, yeah.  One on me and my brother all squeezed in one of those where you couldn't put your head in.  You could see each other across the way.  Right, you could see each other.  You could see people were whacking off.  You look at them, and they catch you.  I'm not jacking off over here.  Yes, you are, cocksucker.  You show me on.  Everyone in the round.  It was like seeing a concert in the round, but it was a naked girl. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, it was like Westbury Music Fair.  Me, you, and my brother went in.  We squeezed into one booth.  Remember he was trying to grab the girl's leg?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he put his hand, his whole arm through.  And then the fucking thing would come down.  Then the thing would come down.  And you couldn't see.  You'd have to put more tokens in.  But, like, if you went early, they'd have to put chicks, they'd pull chicks off the street.  Like, it was chicks that would fuck all night long, and then they'd go in there for, like, the last happy hour.  It's the street walkers.  And they'd go and lay down, like, a black chick and some guy that was fucked up would fuck them. 
[02:14:30]  And the table would spin around.  And they either had the glasses that the window that popped up.  Yeah.  Or the one that was just open where you could smell the pussy and the jizz and the vodka and the cigarettes.  And then after she got fucked, she came to every window for, like, a tip.  You know what I'm saying?  So you'd have to give her, like, change.  I remember when I was, like, 13, 14, I sucked a black tit with just one tit.  That's all she could fit in the glass.  I sucked that motherfucker like she had milk in there for 35, 38 cents.  I don't know what I had. 
[02:15:00]  I sucked that black tit.  That was tremendous.  Then my friend Lance got his head caught in one of the things.  He had to call the fucking guy.  That's embarrassing.  All those peep shows were such a...  I didn't know they were fuck shows.  They had the peep shows.  Some of them had women that just came in.  Some of them had women that you could see had gotten stabbed.  They just got out of Roosevelt Hospital.  They had, like, a patch in their back and shit.  Yeah, yeah.  They'd go in there and they're like, can I catch a shift?  And somebody would fuck them.  No condom.  Oh, my God.  They'd be all sweaty.  And you look at this as a 13-year-old. 
[02:15:30]  This is tremendous.  This is fucking...  You know, you really got to imagine that.  It was probably a very tough job to get that cleaned up.  To get a city that was in the shape New York City was in, in the mid-70s to early-80s and whatnot.  And we pushed the 90s with that stuff.  I know, but, like, just starting the cleanup procedure and how long it took.  But to actually get it done, because a lot of big cities, they just give up on that shit.  But do you remember, we were at N.E.W., I think, at the time.  And remember when Giuliani said, I'm cleaning up Times Square. 
[02:16:00]  We all, anyone that knows New York, we're like, yeah, good luck with that.  Yeah, yeah, good luck.  Now, fast forward.  Look at this thing.  It's a money-making machine down there now.  It's unbelievable.  A tourist destination.  The turnaround is, wow.  Just saying 42nd Street when you were a kid.  Oh, we got your heart.  You're like, oh, let's go down to 42nd Street.  It was nothing but fucking hookers, peep shows.  Me and my crew, we were too scared.  Go down to 42nd?  No, we went into Times Square like you're talking about. 
[02:16:30]  But we kind of, we just walked around and, like, looked.  Got approached for fucking sex, drugs.  All that.  But we were too scared to actually go into some of these places.  What do you need, man?  What do you want?  We want it.  Well, yeah, but marijuana, cocaine, acid, acid, acid, marijuana, cocaine, ten keys.  You would just hear it, hear it.  And it was all fake.  Constant.  It was all fake.  Everything.  If you bought something, it was fake.  Off the street.  And then you'd fucking turn and it'd be three-card Monty on Broadway.  Yeah, three-card Monty.  One of my boys, we used to, listen to how crazy me and my guys were in Jersey.  We used to snort TAC Crystal, which, let's cut this shit. 
[02:17:00]  That's fucking Gorilla Biscuits.  That's, uh, that's that shit.  You know, whatever was big in the 70s.  What was that?  Angel Dust.  Angel Dust.  You either got it, like, in Harlem, uh, two, uh, two, like, tray bags, which you sprinkled  on weed, or you got it in Jersey and you snorted ten bucks.  You did Angel Dust.  We snorted Angel Dust.  Wow.  Come over here, take a bus, and then play three-card Monty.  And the deal was we met on 178th Street.  So we got off the bus here, and we'd go, it's one o'clock, five o'clock in front of Port 
[02:17:30]  Authority, because we're going to walk across the bridge.  So that was our goal.  So me and Anthony, you would go with somebody else, and we'd meet up there.  What'd you do?  Oh, we went to Spanish Harlem.  We fucking bumped into this pimp.  Whatever.  That's how we did it.  13-14.  That's amazing.  So when I sit there back, I go, how fucking lucky am I that I, you know, I went up and  down this shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you played three-card Monty?  Uh, I think one time.  Or you just wanted to check it out.  We would, you'd stand there and see the, watch the tourists get fucking raped. 
[02:18:00]  It was fun until they started looking at you, like, all right, yeah, you're next.  And you're like, oh, fuck.  Nah.  And sometimes they sucked you in.  Where is it?  Where is it?  Yeah, where is it?  Sometimes.  I had a friend once go, what the fuck is wrong with you?  It's a fucking scam.  What the?  And also I see him.  And all of a sudden he's like, hold on.  He put the 20.  And all of a sudden we thought it was a scam.  I fucking saw it.  I saw it, you know, so.  Wow, they were really good.  They were very good.  They got rid of three-card Monty.  Yeah, yeah.  It's funny when you see an old New York video on YouTube.  I was watching some a month or two ago. 
[02:18:30]  Our Latin thing.  It's a documentary they did in New York City in the early 70s about Latin music.  You know, Fonny All-Stars and Hector Laveau and all that.  And they show the cities.  It was fucking filthy.  Amazing.  Fucking paper.  Every.  Paper on the streets.  Just the literal filth.  The garbage that was on the sidewalks and in the streets.  Well, taxi driver shows it pretty good.  Fucking filth.  Taxi driver's good.  You know what else?  The French Connection.  The French Connection.  The French Connection shows some great old New York City fucking filth. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, bums.  Paul in Freeholms wants to know if you ever had a box lunch.  What is a box lunch?  Oh, no.  In Times Square.  All right, we might have to have.  That's got to be eating some fucking nasty pussy.  What's a box lunch?  Hey, guys.  A box lunch is exactly what it sounds like.  Now, I've already read about this, but I've read about it in many places.  It's in Times Square in the early 70s.  There would be a girl on stage, and it was a dollar a lick. 
[02:19:30]  Jesus.  And she would wipe herself off with, like, a towelette.  You ever have a box lunch, Joey?  A dollar a lick, Joey?  No, no, no, no.  Sounds like something Norton would do.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, like I said, that was early 70s.  Yeah, all right.  No, I'd never heard of that one.  Thanks.  And then another guy asking if we ever did the fake IDs thing.  Yes.  That was easy.  We did that.  We did that, but we were too scared to go into the porn stuff.  IDs were like fucking nothing back then, too. 
[02:20:00]  Like, your license was a piece of paper.  No picture on it or anything.  The Jersey license had no picture on it.  No picture.  So if your friend had a brother, you stole his license.  Yeah.  He got the duplicate.  You got the...  It was tremendous.  Very easy.  You typed in the shit and signed it.  Remember how lame you were if you didn't have a fake ID at 16 or 17?  Had to have one.  It's like, it's so easy to do.  What's wrong with you?  And a lot of the guys from Long Island, where we were from, would go in just to do that.  Now your license has sonar radar.  Oh, God.  You see the new one? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, it's holograms and shit, I think.  No, they got you.  No, they got you.  These fucking things.  You still do the pod, right?  You know what?  I stopped smoking three weeks ago.  Three weeks.  Why?  Because I'll tell you what happened.  I started going to jiu-jitsu, and I'm working hard, I'm going to kettlebell class, I'm running  around, and my cardio's sucking ass.  So I said, let me give it a couple weeks, you know, just to see if that helps.  I mean, it's 30 fucking years of smoking pot.  Wow.  Eventually, you know, and it's not like I smoke cigarettes or nothing. 
[02:21:00]  I'll smoke a cigarette from time not in a while now.  You know, we just had a baby at the house.  Well, congratulations.  So, thank you.  So, she's a year old, a year and a half.  I mean, I'm fucking 51.  My wife's 44.  We were together 15 years.  Nothing ever happened.  Nothing.  Oh, this is a surprise?  Yeah.  Out of nowhere?  Out of nowhere.  You gave up trying, basically?  No, we didn't give up trying.  I just thought I was defective good.  30 years of blow, THC, the New York City pollution.  I swam in the Hudson.  You know, I ate an eel from the fucking Hudson when in the 80s. 
[02:21:30]  You know, somewhere, the sperm bank tied up.  You know, and she's a nice...  You know, we had cats, and she's very sweet, and somebody threw a blessing on me, you know.  Damn.  She's beautiful, the wife is happy.  Changed her life, right?  Yeah.  But not, you know, all these fucking people.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck you.  I'm still a savage, though.  I just...  It's just...  You're focused.  Your day is more...  You have this tunnel vision.  Yeah.  Where you can't...  There's no more...  You can't eat the fat.  There's no more fat.  It's me and her and my wife, and I go on the road, and I have the podcast, and I fuck around, 
[02:22:00]  but, you know, that's it.  And you're 50.  What are you going to do?  That's it.  No more pot for Joey Diaz.  Well, I didn't say...  I'm going back on Doug Fucko's...  What's his name?  Doug Benson's...  My man's podcast.  Right.  So, I'm doing that the 18th.  So, basically, I got to smoke on that thing.  So, it would basically be 30 days.  Right.  Okay.  So, I just want to see how it felt.  I mean, I tell you what, I do feel great.  Right.  You know, I'm still not running up fucking stairs.  Right.  That's the sad part of it.  But it feels good to give it a break.  I ate a Gumi Bear this morning, just to get the blood going. 
[02:22:30]  A THC Gumi Bear.  Gumi Bear.  You know, like a Gummy Bear, only with THC in it.  Oh, seriously?  Yeah.  Okay.  I still eat it, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, you're just not smoking it.  And I smoke the vapor pen.  I just don't smoke the fucking joints, like I'm going out of stock.  Because it feels good.  I thought it feels good, because you're not on the pot.  No, no.  You're just getting a pot of Gumi Bear.  Oh, you're getting it on the way.  Cheebo Chew on the plane, yes, that was fucked up.  I fell asleep the last hour.  Cheebo Chew.  All right.  All kinds of things.  Now it all makes sense.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I'm just not smoking, like, you know. 
[02:23:00]  The smoke isn't good for your lungs, is what you're saying.  But, you know, when you go get your license, they always say to you, have you considered  vaporizing?  I'm like, not really.  You know, I smoke, this is the way.  You know, I talk about cleaning up the city.  You know, when the first time I bought pot in the city was, I was 14, and I went to a church  in the village, and my friend's like, wait in the car.  How much do you want?  Ten bucks.  And I saw him walk into the church into the bingo downstairs, and he came out.  That day, I lost, like, faith in the church, because I was a real fucking Catholic. 
[02:23:30]  Right.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And I seen, like, the priest down there, so he was in.  In those days, people came in, they sold weed, and they probably kicked the priest 300.  And he was happy.  I remember they got me, like, an eighth of weed and a little chunk of hash at a fucking  church.  At a church.  And I was so happy.  How smart is that?  That's how fucking crazy New York was.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the, you know, people will never understand.  That's how you could, you know, I left New York for a lot of reasons I left this area.  But the main reason was everything is too easy. 
[02:24:00]  I could come and buy a bazooka at four in the morning.  I could come into New York and go, oh, Opie, somebody fuck with you.  Let's go buy guns.  Right.  I had it that good.  Yep.  If I wanted an eight ball, I could buy an eight ball.  If I wanted a kilo, it's too, it was too wide open.  You know, now I come to New York, and I'm here with Joe last time.  I can't sleep at night.  Or I fall asleep at eight like the old man that I am.  And then at four, I'm walking around.  I got up at three last time and walked around.  There was nobody on the streets.  No.  This isn't the New York I left.  No, no.  At fucking three in the morning. 
[02:24:30]  No, these streets close down now.  These streets close down at night.  I walked a half a mile looking for a friend.  That's the city.  I had a joint.  You're looking for a fucking friend.  That's the city that never sleeps.  If you're looking for a friend, you got a joint.  You'll find somebody.  You'll find a friend.  Yeah, yeah.  At three in the morning.  Yeah.  So everything has.  You know, three in the morning was like, fuck, we're in Jersey.  The bar's closed.  Let's go into New York.  They give you sunglasses when you walked out of your place.  See, why can't they fucking like do that with Detroit?  I mean, New York was broke at one point, too.  Why can't they just do that?  They don't have money coming in, though. 
[02:25:00]  With Detroit.  You've got to have the money coming in.  The thing is, New York didn't have the money coming in, either.  They got rid of the corruption.  Like, they had to fucking, remember Gerald Ford?  Of course.  Because New York City dropped dead and under eight beam and everything.  But it just, the city was broke and somehow managed to use it as a tourist location.  There was more corruption.  They were getting rid of it.  Yeah, that's true.  But I mean, it just seems to me like, given the right leadership, any city could probably recover. 
[02:25:30]  I don't know.  Detroit's pretty rough.  It's fucking rough.  It's fucked, I know.  It's rough.  It's looking at videos on YouTube.  But listen, it's amazing.  It's not only Detroit.  When you travel to a lot of these cities, you see the demise of these cities starting.  You know, I did a show in Pittsburgh two years ago.  Yeah, Ben.  And they were telling me that the bars around the stadium don't open unless it's baseball season.  Really?  Like, year-round.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  The city, the scene moved to the other part of the city.  So that bar, that hip, that scene isn't that hip.  So no one would be there.  You know, you go to cities like Buffalo. 
[02:26:00]  I had some great construction when I went this time in January.  Really?  Well, Buffalo, down the Great Lakes, that was all industry that has dried up.  It's dried up.  The boating industry and all.  And there's massive, like, factories and industries that are just, like, closed down, just sitting there.  Once Fisher-Price left Buffalo, that was the beginning of the end.  You know, what people don't realize is Buffalo has the number one attendance in minor league baseball with the Buffalo Bisons.  Since fucking Jesus left Chicago.  Since it was just Polish people up in fucking Buffalo eating pierogies.  And they won't get them a major league stadium because they won't hold the... 
[02:26:30]  That's a fucking lie.  Today, they're building phones with...  You could fuck a phone in two years.  In two years, you're going to be able to prick a fuck.  A pussy's going to come out in your bucket.  You can't build a fucking stadium with a whole 10 pounds of snow, bitch.  Up in Buffalo.  That'll kick the city out.  They've been trying to get that team for...  For years.  Since I've been there, which I left in, I don't know, 90, I guess.  91, somewhere around there.  And even back then, they were hopeful that it was right around the corner they were going to get their team.  It's not happening.  And their stadium's beautiful up there.  They have a nice minor league stadium. 
[02:27:00]  But Detroit, that whole area, Cleveland, Detroit, Detroit needs a fucking infusion.  Well, Cleveland downtown is creepy.  It's creepy.  We were up there about a year ago.  That always freaks me.  It's zombie lands, man.  No one there.  It's an empty fucking city.  But as soon as you walk down the street, all the homeless people come right at you immediately.  They're a bit aggressive up there in Cleveland.  It's fucking, you know, it's hunger.  And we're going to get it.  Hunger's coming.  This is real.  You know, I mean, I hope they do something in Detroit.  That's one of my all-time favorite fucking...  Listen, Michigan's a great place, bro. 
[02:27:30]  You want to talk about a bag of Coke and some dirty white women?  Michigan's a spot, Jack.  If you want to get your dick sucked old-fashioned with a chick with dirt on her heels,  you know when they're sucking your dick and they got dirt on their heels from the flip-flops?  That's a good dick sucker.  An American dick sucking.  And you put a Coke rock in their pussy and you eat it.  Nice.  You work that fucking monkey like a savage.  That's Detroit.  They got some fucking tremendous American fucking women up there.  That sounds good.  But now, you know, I hear that like Dearborn and all that is very heroin-ish. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, yeah?  It's the biggest Arab community in the country.  And ever since 9-11, they got a lot of H in that.  You know, that black neighborhood in Detroit, that's gone.  Coco's Comedy, all that shit where I used to go do comedy 10 years ago.  Yeah, done.  So they need somebody that's coming in with $20 billion.  Right.  You know, but again, everything has to be ruined.  Can't you buy a house for $60 in Detroit?  Something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it's worth a shot.  I think it's worth a shot.  Let's buy a few houses and see what happens.  Until the leadership changes, though. 
[02:28:30]  You've still got that heavily Democratic.  There's no one willing to really crack some fucking heads and clean shit up like Giuliani did.  The hipsters are moving in a little bit in the art communities.  Oh, yeah.  I think you're going to get some of that.  A little bit.  Detroit's a little tough nut to crack than William Burr.  You've got to see Anthony Bourdain's episode on Detroit.  It's pretty good.  He's not giving it that much hope.  He shows a tiny bit of hope, a drop of hope.  A little glimmer.  A little taste.  Did you ever do the heroin?  A couple times.  Nothing in the needle.  I can't see needles. 
[02:29:00]  Thank you.  That's where the good man helped me upstairs.  A little snowed edge.  Needles scare a lot of people.  Needles.  I did a couple lines in Jersey.  I did a couple lines in Colorado or something.  A couple in California.  That was it.  I loved it.  I could see.  You could see it becoming a problem?  I could see it becoming a big problem.  Oh, shit.  That's one thing I never.  Not one thing.  That's one of the things that I never did.  Never tried that out.  That, for me, was absolutely crossing the line.  It was out there.  Coke was fine. 
[02:29:30]  Fucking a little freebasing was fine.  A little freebasing is fine.  But that heroin, that was the line where you all of a sudden were a junkie, you know?  You know, freebasing for me was just too much drama to get hot.  I got to get the rock, baking soda, cook it, run it through a fucking sock.  We never did the baking soda.  We did it the fucking, the nice way with the ammonia and ether.  Jesus.  And water. 
[02:30:00]  How'd you figure this out?  Oh, yeah.  Someone showed me.  We didn't have the internet, though.  How'd you figure it out?  How'd you figure it out?  How'd you figure it out?  You know, give a man a freebase, he could get high for a day.  Teach a man to freebase.  Without the internet, how do you figure that out?  Just word of mouth, I guess.  Word of mouth.  Remember that shit, how crazy that was?  And then you'd have a slate, like a polished piece of slate, and you'd dip into the ether,  which was on a different level than the water and the ammonia, and you'd put the coke in there,  stir it around, and when you took it out and spread it onto the slate, and you'd go, 
[02:30:30]  like that, and it would just evaporate instantly and leave this white fucking streak.  And you'd take the blade, right in that pipe, first hit of the night.  Oh, my fucking God!  Oh, my God.  That was crazy.  It was crazy.  You know, by 82, they were selling kits.  Yeah.  Really?  There was a place in Jersey, East-West, and you're going there for 50 bucks, and you bought  a kit that came with everything.  The powder, the fucking glasses, the spoon, and it was just, it was how it took over. 
[02:31:00]  That was another thing, too.  People that smoked crack, because I was like, no, I fucking freebased it.  I don't smoke crack, you fucking piece of shit.  I looked at crack like you're a fucking, you know, little low-life fucking ghetto rat.  Get out of here.  I'm talking freebased.  This is a civilized way to do cocaine.  Fucking clean, no chemicals, just eat the ammonia.  Eat the ammonia.  All the impurities come out.  There you go.  We got to take a break, because we got Jim Jeffries on hold. 
[02:31:30]  We got Adam Farrar down the hall, and, of course, Joey Diaz is here.  You're playing the Stress Factory, huh?  Yes, brother.  Very cool.  Vinny's place.  Does a good job down there.  Yeah, it was great last night.  Vinny, man.  Good crowd?  Yeah, we're back last night.  A lot of kids I grew up with, you know, came out, so that's great.  Oh, yeah.  They grew up in Jersey.  Really?  Still alive, huh?  They're still fucking alive, man.  I can't listen to that.  And they're 40?  Are they tempting you?  Not at all.  Like, old times' sake.  No, not at all. 
[02:32:00]  These guys are all...  For old times' sake.  For old times' sake.  I have, like, maybe three friends that get evil, and I've already warned them to do  me the favor as a friend.  Right.  Don't get evil.  It's not worth it.  You're going to sit like an asshole.  You're going to look there.  Your jaw is going from side to side.  And I've got to be honest with you.  I love your appearances on Joe Rogan's podcast, obviously, but I haven't heard your individual  podcast yet.  It's craziness.  I've got to try it this weekend.  Where do they find you?  The Church of What's Happening Now on iTunes.  Okay.  The Church of What's Happening Now on iTunes. 
[02:32:30]  That's Joey Diaz's podcast, and it's Mad Flavor on Twitter.  That's it.  All right.  We're going to continue with Joey.  Stay there.  I'll be right here.  Yeah.  A little Rick James for Joey Diaz.  Is that it?  Mad Flavor on Twitter, who's also playing the Stress Factory this weekend.  Went well last night, and he's got shows tonight and tomorrow at Vinny's Place.  Woo!  I've got to go down to the Stress Factory.  It's been a while.  I don't know if I can do it this weekend.  I've got to go out to Huntington, but...  Don't sweat the smoke.  All right.  That's a...  You know, it was hard this morning from traffic this morning. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Did he put you up in that hotel?  Bitch.  Yeah.  He's putting me up in that hotel.  He's good that way.  He's got to deal with those hotels over there right off the Turnpike, right?  Yeah.  Really?  Really sharp.  It's nice.  If you go and check out Vinny's club, he'll set you up.  Yeah?  He'll give you a room.  I went out there once.  Yeah.  I drove back.  I go, Vinny, I don't feel like driving home.  He's like, I'll put you up.  What a guy.  I'll put you up.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  This midget voice.  Little people, big world.  Same guy.  Same voice.  If you know that guy.  Same guy.  Adam Farrar is in studio.  Hi, Adam.  Hey.  Oh, wait.  Maybe I should do that.  There we go.  How are you, fellas?  Hey, man.  We were talking about the old school New York.  Yeah, yeah.  You remember being a Long Island guy.  You come from our side.  Yeah, but I heard you.  I was in the office.  I heard you like your crew would come in and you were too...  Too scared.  I swear to God.  I came in and it was Ozzy.  When I came in, we came in the city.  We got off the train.  We looked around.  And Ozzy's like, she was a hooker. 
[02:34:00]  And Ozzy's like, she was just into me.  I said, for 20 bucks, she'll be into all of us.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's get the hell out of here.  She wasn't into you.  I just liked observing the pimps and the hookers.  They were right in the open.  And we were brave to go in and get dumb fake licenses.  That was it.  And we were just walking around around the seedy parts and thought we were cool.  And look.  Yeah.  Oh, the looking was great.  But like Joey's saying, going in at 13 or 14 and seeing a fuck show.  A peep show like that.  No, no.  That would be unbelievable.  You're a soldier.  You're just disgusting.  You have that mentality.  Listen, it still shocks you. 
[02:34:30]  Later on, you think about it.  You're like, what was I thinking?  You couldn't control.  Like, I wouldn't be able to control myself.  I remember having a fake ID and going into the tender trap.  That fucking tit bar.  Yeah.  Oh, that was disgusting.  And just like breathing like.  Yeah.  Because you knew a chick was coming out.  Her tits were going to be hanging out.  Like nursing that fucking $8 bottle of Bud.  That was it.  I had the fake ID because you guys were all older than me.  Yeah, yeah.  So I needed it to hang.  I needed to get it.  Remember the salty dog? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, the salty dog.  I was terrified.  Well, the tender trap was high class, though.  What are you talking about?  Do you remember Danny's Den?  Danny's Den.  Yeah, the Den.  You remember Danny's Den?  It's now like a wall by homes parking lot or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What was that?  Jericho?  Yeah.  I think it was Jericho.  Turnpike.  And that's where the rough ones were.  Brass Monkey was a good place.  But it was still cool to see him with their, like Joey was saying, their gunshot wounds  and their C-section scars and they didn't, they kept dancing. 
[02:35:30]  They looked like subway cars.  Sexy as fuck.  I love those Ronkonkoma Long Island light trash strippers that would be there during the  day when you leave the strip club and the sun is fucking hurting your eyes still because  it's high noon.  Yeah, the pretty girls are on the weekend.  Right.  And at night.  We went on open pole night.  Or after open pole.  Or after 8 p.m.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just the worst.  I don't go to strip clubs like now for some reason.  No, no, no.  Like even Vegas or nothing.  No reason. 
[02:36:00]  It holds no, like when I was a kid, the whole thing was sneaking in was the best part.  Oh, it was amazing.  You're like, I gotta get out of here.  I'm gonna get a social disease.  And just seeing like, to see nudity like that, there's just no mystery anymore.  When I was, these kids don't understand.  No, it was the only place you could see shit like that.  You didn't have the internet or anything.  So when you walked in one of these places and women were nude, you're out of your mind.  When I was like 15, they opened up a bar in northern New Jersey called the Meadowlands  Inn.  A bunch of cops got together. 
[02:36:30]  And one like that, I stumbled in there.  I thought they would, you know, when you're 15, you fucking try.  Sure.  You at least want to go, yeah, I want to get in.  And one guy was like, yeah, get in there.  And I went in there and it was the biggest mistake of my life because I saw the worst.  Like, Wednesday nights was erotic banana night.  So for two bucks, they give you a frozen banana at the door.  You peeled it, gave it to the chicks.  You peeled it, stuck on her monkey, gave it back, and you had to eat it.  Oh, shit.  Disgusting.  There was a chick that sat on a Galliano bottle.  There were chicks that would take the fucking, there were chicks that would take the Budweiser, 
[02:37:00]  whack themselves off, suck the beer out, and then spit it.  But the all-time classic was Christmas Eve, 1980.  I was in there.  I was about 16 with some of my fucking goombas.  We walked away.  How bad could it be?  Let's go down there Christmas Eve.  And we're kids.  We're fucking kids.  And no matter how big you are, you think you are at 16, you're an emotional fucking puke.  And we're sitting there, we think we're gangsters, and there's old guys at the bar.  And in those days, the strip clubs were smaller.  And there was a bar, and it was a small stage. 
[02:37:30]  You could smell her fucking feet.  That's how, so all she had to do was basically pick her leg up and walk over to you.  This guy was sitting at the bar, minding his own business.  She did something.  You know how they come, they have, like, you know, I'm going to do something.  I guess this poor guy didn't know what he was getting involved in.  This chick put her leg, came over, squatted in his face, and this guy ate her monkey at the bar.  Like, eight feet from us.  You could hear, like, that exorcist when she puts him.  And then she took his fucking teatops.  She took his teeth out and put him in her monkey and put him back. 
[02:38:00]  We were shocked for fucking life.  It was all over.  Do you know the Meadowlands Inn was so disgusting that they had a map at, like, Sex World?  Like, I remember going home going, they have a map to a bar in my hometown.  Like, I felt fucking like a king.  Yeah, it is.  Like, forget New York City.  They have it.  The dirtiest place ever is in Jersey, over the fucking bridge.  Something to be proud of right there.  And then they closed it down, and a couple bars opened up and tried to do that same format.  That's the old school strip clubs like that. 
[02:38:30]  That was it.  That was it.  Because now they all try to be like a gentleman's club.  Yeah.  I like the neighborhood strip club.  Yeah, dress code.  No jeans.  Why?  Steak night.  Why?  Like, I'm going to go eat the fucking steaks and smell that fucking...  Give us 20 minutes if you want the souffle.  Call ahead.  And you used to just have a little few bucks in front of you, and you'd give them a dollar.  And now they all have the back room for the private dance.  It's like you're a local little shitty strip club.  Although, one of the best steaks I had was in Dallas.  They knew how to do it. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I had a strip club.  Yeah, it was called The Lodge, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, they had a really nice steak.  Texas would do something like that.  They really had a good steak.  The guy from Pantera owns one of those places.  One of the guys, that's one of them.  I heard that he does it well, too.  I want to ask Joey about Whitney Houston, because we were talking about this off-air.  I feel like you told us, you told the story on our show, but maybe I heard it on Rogan's show.  What?  He used to hang with Whitney Houston.  No, I never hung with Whitney Houston.  A little bit.  A little bit.  What happened was, I was on the Rogan podcast, and we got into a conversation with him. 
[02:39:30]  It's really weird how, you know, again, sometimes it's not something that you plan.  Yeah.  You have written out.  Sure.  I'd forgotten about it.  I thought, in the back of my mind, somebody's always helped somebody out.  Like, somebody's come on the show, and on the way out, they'll blink at Opie, and Opie's  like, what's up?  You know, I can get a kilo of Coke.  And Opie will make a call and say, yeah, go hook my buddy up in Long Island.  And Opie will never say nothing.  Well, I had the same thing happen to me in L.A.  Like, 2001, I used to buy weed from a kid. 
[02:40:00]  And he was one of those guys at CAA, kind of, a stock clerk.  And he met somebody, and he wasn't at CAA anymore, and he met some guy, and that guy  went on to be a road manager for musicians.  And one day I was buying weed, and he goes, do you know where I get some fucking blow for  him?  And I did it, and I wanted to help him, but I go, nah.  I didn't know for months.  I kept saying, nah.  And one day he came to me, he was like, bro, it's Whitney Houston's road manager.  I was like, fuck it.  Let's try it out.  You know, it's Whitney Houston.  How bad could it be?  So I started getting them blow from time to time.  Like, they would buy, like, 17 grams, like, 14 grams. 
[02:40:30]  And he would give it to me with per diem money, like, from the fucking, he would have  the envelope, like, the music.  It was for him, or was it?  It was for her, but with his per diem money.  That was the story, you know?  Oh, wow, yeah.  And it went on for, like, two and a half months, you know, like, every fucking day, they would  go, like, I'd be at the comedy store, and all of a sudden, bing.  And in a way, it was, like, my income at the time.  I would get, like, an eight ball out of the fucking deal.  And then I never heard from them ever again.  Like, and it was really ironic.  It was Grammy weekend, where they told me, not that weekend when she died just recently.  Right, right. 
[02:41:00]  This is, like, 10 years ago, 12 years ago.  Yeah, 10 years ago.  You don't need that on your conscience.  No.  But it was really weird.  I had never, I had spoken about it on the Joe Rogan podcast, and it was amazing how I  got contacted.  And I did this a year or two before she died.  And I got contacted by thousands of people.  Yeah, huh?  Thousands.  And I said, you know what?  I don't want to talk about it, because it was...  Oh, I thought they wanted coke.  No, no, no.  I thought they wanted coke, too.  A lot of people are calling.  You got a kilo.  Joey can get.  The shit that kills a motherfucker.  No.  So, it's amazing how I never spoke about it. 
[02:41:30]  You know, it was a little like nothing to me.  And I spoke about it, and like, two years later, she died.  So, I don't like a lot of...  Well, you would know that.  How do you not know that's a huge story?  Yeah.  You talk about it.  It's like, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, one of America's sweethearts there as a coke fiend.  I've always heard, but everybody knew.  At that point, they did, yeah.  You know, I found out the weirdest way.  I knew when I came home for a wedding.  I had friends of mine that had a car wash and then go with clips.  And at the wedding, we're talking, and they're like, dog, you know who comes in all the time?  And there's always bindles. 
[02:42:00]  Remember, they came in bindles.  Oh.  Under her seat.  Okay, so she had them in the car.  And I'm like, Whitney Houston, really?  Really?  You're going to tell me, Whitney, I want love.  Fucking all those children are the future.  Stop it, all right?  Fucking stop it.  Let them lead the way.  And then the reputation got out of the hand.  And when you go to Atlanta, you really hear about it.  Like, that's real.  Yeah.  The brothers really fucking like, are you kidding me?  Fuck.  She was around here terrorizing people.  Jesus.  I got to go to the phone real fast, because Jim Jeffries is catching a flight.  Yes.  Jim.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  We got Joey Diaz in the studio and Adam Farrar. 
[02:42:30]  Hey, Jim.  How are you doing, guys?  How are you, buddy?  Where are you flying to?  I'm about to go to New Orleans for a gig.  I'm going off to Dallas.  Nice.  Well, I think so.  I'm going a week after Mardi Gras, so I don't think it's going to be that exciting.  Dallas, tell them where to get a steak.  Yeah, go to the lodge, I think it's called.  You can get a nice steak at a strip club down there.  I'm serious.  And then another place is called Legs and Eggs.  That doesn't sound good. 
[02:43:00]  Or that's their...  Breakfast joint?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's their promotion.  So when all the other bars and stuff close down, you go and get Legs and Eggs.  Well, a strip club stays open a little longer and you get some eggs with your legs, yeah.  Jesus.  So, yeah.  No, I hear New Orleans.  Everyone says you've got to go to New Orleans when it's not Mardi Gras because it still has  that party atmosphere, but the streets aren't packed.  Yeah, I only go there when women accept, you know, they take their tops off for beads.  Right.  I like that level of currency. 
[02:43:30]  But they still do it all year round.  Do they do it all year round?  Yeah, all year round they do that.  Of course.  We've only been there for Mardi Gras.  And it's been crazy.  Insanity.  You can't even cross the street.  Yeah.  We used to go down there every year.  I think we did maybe three.  Yep.  And we used to broadcast from the balconies and we would see such debauchery happening  We would just watch black guys beating up white people in the street.  It was fantastic.  Jesus.  No, the knockout game.  The knockout game was years ago.  Yeah, it was before everyone called it the knockout game.  We saw it in New Orleans at Mardi Gras. 
[02:44:00]  These couple, these poor couples, and you couldn't even warn them because no one could hear you.  Yeah.  From above, we would see it going down, man.  This nice couple just walking on the sidewalk and they would turn a corner and oh, hell,  like, oh, there's a bunch of thugs with all the walking right by them.  Bam!  And the guy would get punched in the face.  The girl's getting her tits squeezed and fucking just thugs just.  I'm not a fan of Mardi Gras.  Yeah, for punching white people in the face.  You get some beads. 
[02:44:30]  How's the show going?  I was stupid to say that it's starting up soon, but it started a couple weeks ago, right?  Legit?  The new season?  It's going good, man.  Yeah.  The critics are like, it's a bit hard to find on the new channel.  It's on FXX now.  FXX.  Yeah.  That makes it a bit more difficult, but it's not.  It's going good, man.  I think I'm pretty happy with the ratings.  I'm pretty happy with the response we've been getting.  And, you know, this season's a lot better than the first season. 
[02:45:00]  First season had a few shitty episodes in there.  No, I liked it, man.  You're being hard on yourself.  I liked every episode.  Oh, watch this one, then.  Okay.  Even though it started.  No, I can't watch everything.  I got two.  You got one kid.  Imagine two of them.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, but how late are you putting these kids to bed?  It's like 10.  Wow.  He's putting himself to bed at that hour.  Yeah, I'm going to bed by 10 if I can, but my son, he's already a night owl. 
[02:45:30]  We messed that one up.  We're doing it right with the second one.  Second one, we make sure it goes to bed right at 738.  Nice.  The older one, he's only three and a half, pushing four, I guess.  Yeah.  He goes to bed whenever he wants.  We blew it.  I got to bring up.  I told you about Ellis years ago.  Oh, yes.  I got your text.  I was the head of the curve on that one.  Yeah, I got your text.  Yeah, you know, right? 
[02:46:00]  He's got what I call bad character, man.  He's one of those kids that whenever he came into the studio, he always sort of eyed off  with me a little bit and sort of went, well, what about if you were a dog collar with  a fucking electric shock in it, or I hit you over the legs with a bamboo stick?  And I'm like, no, I don't want to do that.  Right.  Yeah, that's right.  I've worked on my personality for years.  You fucking suck.  You fucking can't be lifting with a fucking shock collar.  Why don't we have some witty conversation, you dick?  You dick. 
[02:46:30]  That's right.  The shock collar and the stick.  You know what, Bud?  It's easy to just trash everything, but that was kind of a fun day, though.  Although you're right.  It was a fun day.  Because you were really not into that.  I told you about that, right?  If you watch that footage back, I acted like my shock collar was my button, but I never  actually pressed the button.  I just acted like I was getting shocked a couple of times when I took it off.  Good for you.  I wasn't going to risk that.  I don't want to fucking electric vault through my neck. 
[02:47:00]  Go through that shit.  That's right.  The brain damage.  We got a guy that's been calling us lately that wants in on this badly, because I guess  he's wondering if you remember him.  Hold on a second.  John, you're on with Jim Jeffries.  Jim Jeffries, what's up?  I don't know if he remembers me, but I just got to say, Jim Jeffries is fucking hilarious  to hang out with.  And, well, I don't know.  So for years, I would drive without a license and speed. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, Jesus.  And it's amazing how many times he would let me go.  You know, when you're coming back from Irvine.  Yeah, yeah.  Irvine, Ontario, and Brea.  Those are the big ones when you're coming back.  And a cop told me, he goes, if you don't have alcohol on your breath on Fridays and  Saturdays, we let you go.  We don't have time to give you a ticket.  Right.  Wow.  If you're a gentleman, you're not getting drunk.  If you don't open it, but why are you fucking pulling me over?  Right.  They let you go.  And if your sticker's current on you.  If your sticker's current.  As long as you don't have alcohol on your breath. 
[02:48:00]  That helps.  They'll let you go.  But I remember getting those tickets and going down there.  I got a ticket one time for no license.  I went down there.  It was like $300.  And I thought it was a fix-it license.  Like, come back in six months and we'll give you $100 back type deal.  I asked her, I go, so what is the car?  And she goes, look, here's the deal, all right?  The fine is $300.  Give me $425.  I don't give a fuck if you ever get a license.  She goes, you don't have to get a dick.  I go, so I don't have to come back? 
[02:48:30]  Nope.  Wow.  I paid the $4.25.  Right.  That was it.  You paid $4.25 and she just let you go?  Let me go.  No license.  I remember walking to the car thinking it was a setup.  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to start the car and they're going to pull me right over.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Like the Nero in Casino.  Yeah, they don't care.  They don't really care.  Put it behind the firewall.  But it's amazing how people think, yeah, it's $25 until you get to court.  Then you have victim compensation, the judge.  Oh, there's all kinds of fucking horseshit.  It's like your cell phone bill. 
[02:49:00]  You don't know what half that shit is.  No, you don't have it.  But if you really look at your cell phone bill, you really will get pissed the fuck off.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  And then you call Sprint and that's a nightmare.  Whatever the fuck they call.  The government and state taxes, they've put on the phone that have nothing to do with phones.  Nothing to do with.  Yeah.  Even when you fly now, too, that's the biggest scam that this, you know, everybody blames  the president.  It's nothing to do with it.  I'm watching flying where it's becoming.  Now the pre-TSA line is getting long.  So now they've got to open up a new one.  So they're going to open up another one in between regular people and first class. 
[02:49:30]  Right.  And you're going to see in about a year or two, if you just fly regularly, it's going to be  a two and a half hour wait.  You're kidding.  Well, they have to.  You can see it.  You can see it.  Remember when Clear came out and then that went away.  And now they have the true thing.  You're supposed to be able to get, like, they do a background check on you.  Yeah.  And you can go right through.  I've been vetted.  Yes.  I've been vetted.  And I can have the peanuts.  Yes.  But pre is getting packed now.  Yeah.  Pre, I'm looking at pre the last two weeks going, oh. 
[02:50:00]  When do you fly?  Because I, do you go in early in the morning?  Thursdays, yeah.  I get the hell out of L.A. Thursdays.  But that's, that's when you get killed.  Is this early in the morning?  Everyone wants to get the fuck out early in the morning.  Not in L.A.  Well, I take the jet blue flight back and forth.  I take the four, if I got to be, I can leave the day before.  Burbank or?  No.  LAX.  LAX.  And I'll take the four o'clock on jet blue out and get in at midnight the night before  for whatever I got to do.  I wouldn't know what time you should leave.  I'll just be like, oh.  No, I get out of L.A.  I'll leave, what, Friday at fucking noon?  Listen, I'm 51.  Can I do that?  If you can get out in the afternoon, it's just less crowded.  I'm 51. 
[02:50:30]  If I could, if I could, listen, I don't have much time left.  I don't want it to be in a fucking car on the 405.  Or on the 5.  So everything I do has fucking movement.  I don't leave my house unless there's an envelope involved.  If he wants to call me and say, come to Santa Monica, that's fucking great.  Invite yourself.  It's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen after 1.30.  It's not going to fucking happen.  Remember SBV?  Sutton Bartham and I.  Why don't you go down to 5th and Ocean at 4.45?  Tell your mother to go to 5th and Ocean at 4.45.  That's what I tell them. 
[02:51:00]  When they call me for an audition, they go, hi.  You have a 5.40.  Let me ask you.  Would you send your mother down?  That's exactly what I say.  Would you send your mother down at 5 o'clock?  They'll just be silent on the other side.  If you notice that kids from Modern Family won the Oscar to show.  What did he say?  He goes, I just want you to know that I went to all those auditions on Ocean Avenue at 4.30.  Because everybody knows when they call you for those, they suck.  You're going to be stuck from the 10 to the 405 on that bridge.  I've got to be on this fucking earthquake.  Abbot Kenny 5 o'clock.  Oh, Abbot Kenny.  To show somebody your hands. 
[02:51:30]  Hi.  Thank you for coming down like this.  Thank you.  And you're like, I have to go.  I'm on strong avail for a Whirlpool commercial.  Yeah.  And you're like, what the fuck?  So, fuck you.  I don't go anywhere.  Oh, wow, man.  It's hilarious.  So what I do is I take the 4 to 5 a.m. flight out of LAX.  It takes me.  I leave Studio City at 4.  And I get to LAX at 4.25.  Nice, yeah.  And that's doing fucking 80 in the HOV lane solo. 
[02:52:00]  You know what I'm saying?  With a vapor pen.  That's when I was smoking dope.  Because there ain't nobody out there.  I get so paranoid I'm doing 90 in the right-hand lane now.  I'm like fucking driving.  You know, there's nobody out there.  I go to the third level, whatever.  You park your car right by the elevator like a fat fuck that I am.  I don't want to walk all around God's creation.  And I go and I get the fuck out of it.  I swear to God.  You leave your car at LAX for how long?  Three days.  Yeah.  It's cheaper.  I did the math once.  Three days is good.  After four days, it's cheaper to take a car service.  So it's 100 each way. 
[02:52:30]  So it's a deuce.  For four days, it's like a buck 60 or something, buck 20.  Well, if you're transporting some fucking illegal shit, you want your trunk, you need that.  That California traffic, I was looking at it this morning, you guys got it together here.  The East Coast has it together, and you still have problems, but you have 90 fucking million  people living in a small area.  When we were in the island, when you guys were in the island when you were kids, and I  go up to Montauk when I was a kid, there was no fucking traffic.  No, no, no.  Now I go to fucking Long Island on Friday at 3 o'clock.  You're dead. 
[02:53:00]  You're dead.  You know it.  My mother moved out.  She's out by my brother Joe.  She's all the way out at age 63.  And I go, Ma, listen, I'll send a car for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Come in here.  That's why on Friday, like today, when the show's over, I get the fuck out of here so fast.  Because by the 15 minutes, it gets worse and worse and worse.  Rush hour, it's rush day.  Yeah.  And the fucking roads are terrible.  I mean, they can steal the potholes.  Man, don't we pay to get that shit fixed? 
[02:53:30]  That's why you need a fucking phone bill.  Yeah, it's on my phone bill.  It's hysterical how I tell people there's a big difference on the 405 between 10 to 6 and  10 after 6.  It's amazing.  10 to 6 in L.A., you get right on that 405.  As long as you get the jump by the skirball, you're good to go.  Right by Getty Center.  By Getty Center, I'm good to go.  Now you're the fucker of the construction.  Now you're the fucker of the construction.  But in my world, listen, guys, I ain't got time to fucking sit.  I get on that HOV lane whether I'm solo or not.  Oh, I always go.  In my world, the baby seat counts as a fucking seat. 
[02:54:00]  Whether she's in the car or not, motherfucker.  I just zoom.  And I pass those stuff.  I don't even start.  What do you do?  I don't even start.  Seven or fucking more.  You're really going to pull me over?  They kill it on the expressway.  All the times they don't get you.  And if they grab your wands, who cares?  You're ahead of the game.  Yeah, it's worth it.  That's how I look at it.  I cannot afford any more fucking points.  I got a ticket.  Remember the Northridge quake?  Were you out there for Northridge?  No, no, no.  I was out for the Northridge quake in California.  The 10, they shut it down.  The only lane that was open was the HOV lane.  And it was the only lane.  So I was in it by myself. 
[02:54:30]  I got a $300 ticket.  You shouldn't be in this lane again.  The day of the earthquake?  No.  When they were digging out and fixing the whole thing, I said, there is no other fucking lane.  Yeah, wow.  Take it up with the court.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, why?  Yeah.  How's Nurse Jackie, by the way?  Great.  It appears when it premieres April 13th.  Yeah, that's what it looks like.  Season six.  Six already.  This is your second season, right?  This is my second season there.  They're doing season six.  Wow.  We're in season four and a half for Top Gear.  Wow.  And I go down, I actually go down after Monday, after Gotham this weekend, I go down and we 
[02:55:00]  start shooting.  Oh, you're at Gotham this weekend?  I'm at Gotham this weekend.  You should promote that.  Yes.  Tonight, Saturday, and Sunday at Gotham.  And then we go back.  And I got to drive.  You remember the Buick Grand National?  Oh, yeah.  I used to love those.  I got to drive one in 86.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Those are fun cars.  What does that mean to not a car guy like myself?  It was a six-cylinder turbo, but when we were kids, that was the coolest Buick there  was, because Buick is usually an old man's car.  Yeah, yeah.  But that was like a renegade car.  Grand National had balls.  Yeah, it was fun. 
[02:55:30]  And I got to drive it, and then that was fun.  That was, because that's the coolest thing about the show, is like I was telling Joey  about the Buick and everything, and all these cars we love as kids, I can, can I have that?  And if they can find it, they'll get it for me.  Did you drive the Paul Walker car?  No.  The Carrera GT, I did not drive the Paul Walker.  I hear they're just a, they're just a scary fucking.  I mean, at that speed, you know, those cars, and they were professional drivers, man.  Shit goes wrong real quick.  Like, why would you have a car that, where shit could go wrong real quick?  It's exciting.  Do you have one if you're, yeah, I know.  It is exciting. 
[02:56:00]  It's like, it's like being aroused at knife point.  It really is.  Yeah, yeah.  But you're excited.  Right.  It's horrifying.  Yeah.  But then once you let off the gas, and you're back again, you're like, oh, that was kind  of cool.  My ADD is just, you won't realize how much I have it until I'm doing like a buck 40, the  car starts getting light, and I'm like, oh, fucking just think fast, rabbit.  Just focus, man, because anything at that speed, oh.  Oh, the tunnel vision you get, the faster you go, the less you're paying attention to on  your peripherals, you are focused out the front of that windshield, and that's it. 
[02:56:30]  My deer pops out.  I went to drag racing school.  Bunny rabbit will kill you.  I just did the drag racing school down there, and it's not a gas.  You floor the gas, and they have a rev limiter on it, but you hit a trans brake, and you  let go.  It just shoots you.  Oh, shit.  And the edges go till, it's like, it's gone to plaid.  Yeah.  The edges just go like this, and you're just focused.  Wow.  How fast are you going?  I don't know.  The fastest I've ever been in a quarter mile is 11 in an electric dragster, so that's 
[02:57:00]  about $1.25.  This was actually, I think they said it was about $1.40, $1.45, like $9.  You're not scared at all?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're scared every fucking time.  Okay, all right.  Cool.  Thank God.  Yes, it's terrifying.  All right.  But it's like fun.  Drag racing school.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to learn that shit.  They can't put you in a real dragster unless you know what you're doing.  They got line locks so you can burn out and everything.  It's not like we used to do in parking lots with just holding the brake.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You lock up the front brakes and then you're big ass tires and then the noise and the violence. 
[02:57:30]  I remember doing that, like, and it was rough enough, uh, four speed to try to work the  clutch, the brake, and the gas to get yourself where your front brakes were holding, your  rear brakes were sliding, and you'd stay in one place and just burn your heel toe the  gas and the brake.  Yeah, yeah, you're, like, feathering it a little bit.  Yeah, that was fucking crazy.  And then, well, the hardest part of that was returning to rent the car with a good story.  Like, I don't know what happened. 
[02:58:00]  I don't know.  Your clutch is kind of bad.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened.  It smells something.  The brakes are, uh, not too good.  That's it.  Yeah.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, is, uh, Chris going to get the car?  I just gave him the fuck train.  Chris, yeah, go get the old vehicle, my friend.  Hell, why don't we start our weekends?  I know.  That sounds good.  Yeah, it's Killed for us.  I've had the great Jeffries.  We did it, man.  Fuck it.  A lot of fun.  Showtime.  Good show, old chap.  Joey Diaz is at the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow.  It's Mad Flavor on Twitter and the podcast again, Joey. 
[02:58:30]  Mondays and Wednesdays, 6 a.m.  The church of what's happening now.  You start at 6 a.m.?  6 a.m.  You can do your podcast any time you want.  Why are you starting at 6 a.m.?  I want to get to people in the morning like you.  I want to get up early.  Get them to download on Twitter.  Rise and shine.  I get up like at 5.  I'm one of those old men.  But I've always gotten up early.  Oh, really?  Right, right, nearly.  Even when you're on stand-up time?  Even, you know, I grew up in a Cuban house.  My mom would beat the shit out of me in the morning.  They'd get up, you got to fucking give your love to the sun and all this shit. 
[02:59:00]  So she'd make me go out and drink coffee in front of the sun and shit.  Cuban coffee wakes you to fuck up.  Cuban coffee in front of the sun, yeah.  In front of the sun.  Yeah, you got to have it in front of the sun.  So I always got instilled in me.  So I used to get up on Twitter and just say stuff and put music on.  So when I started doing the podcast, I'm up anyway.  I hate committing to something in the daytime because you know how L.A. is.  You got something every day at that time.  So I said, let me do it at 6 and get it over with.  I'm done by 7.38.  Here's my sleeping habits. 
[02:59:30]  Around this time of year, I've woken up and not known whether it was A.M. or P.M.  Like, I think like, oh, fuck, I got to go to work.  It's like 6 o'clock and I'm looking and it's kind of blew out.  It's like getting light or dark.  Right.  And then I'm like, wait a minute.  I think it's nighttime.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Yeah.  We're at that time of year where it matches up.  6 a.m.  6 p.m.  Are creepy.  Look exactly the same outside.  That's the worst one.  Like, when you would fall asleep during the day and you wake up and it's night and you're  just like, oh, God. 
[03:00:00]  Where am I?  What am I doing?  What is this?  I wake up early on the weekends because that's my time.  Breakfast or beer.  What am I doing?  What is it?  Before the kids get up, I got a couple hours myself.  It's funny because I'll get on Twitter as he's getting off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's almost like we're tagging each other.  He'll do his last tweet.  I see him.  And then I pop on right after.  I'll see him and I'll go, oh, this is going to be a cat or a gun.  A cat or a gun.  A cat or a gun pick. 
[03:00:30]  What do you got, cats?  One cat.  You're a cat dude.  A little Bengal cat.  Yeah, I'm a cat dude, too.  He's a good guy.  I got a dog.  And you're a gun dude.  He's a pussy.  Yeah.  You love guns.  I love shooting guns.  There are a lot of, I love going to the range.  I'm not a hunter.  I don't like hunting.  I couldn't kill an animal either.  I don't care if you hunt.  I mean, I'm not one of those, you know, I don't give a shit.  But I just love going down to the range, shooting targets, you know, get proficient.  And I like the fact that, you know, I can choose to protect myself in the way I think  is the best for me. 
[03:01:00]  So that's how I feel about the old second.  How did you rehearse that statement?  I've said that on many a show on Fox News.  You might have said that a few times.  Just a few.  But it is true.  When you saw it, put turrets on the house.  I don't like, yeah, yeah.  I just don't like the government stepping in and telling me how I should.  When they deem that the best way to protect themselves is with armed people.  And the best response to someone that's armed is to send in a fuckload of armed people  with what they call assault weapons. 
[03:01:30]  And yet, if I want to protect myself against some threat, they say I can't.  It's ludicrous.  See, I don't have a gun only because you know my proficiency.  Well, yeah.  It could be a problem.  I'll shoot a foot off.  But my personality is like, I don't want a handgun.  I want like a .50 caliber deck cannon off the USS Missouri.  You just put it on the roof of the house.  You just have to move that gun.  You just get off the lawn.  And Ab Farrar is playing Gotham tonight.  Tomorrow and Sunday. 
[03:02:00]  We'll see you, Adam.  On 23rd Street here in New York, right?  Yep.  And, of course, Nurse Jackie, season premiere.  Well, that's a ways down the road.  But still, congratulations.  And you're getting a lot of scenes still, right?  Yeah, it's great.  That's awesome.  Congratulations.  Watch it on demand, catch up.  And then when the new season starts, then you're all fucking into that.  I've got to set the alarm so I can get up and listen to Joey.  I had no idea he was up there.  I'm going to check out your podcast for the first time, Joey.  I'm adding you.  I'm adding you tonight.  I like you on Rogan.  Yeah, absolutely.  We all love him on Rogan.  Yeah, everyone does.  Rogan's a great pool player. 
[03:02:30]  He taught me how to shoot pool.  Yeah, I heard the podcast where he was talking about his pool play.  He was on, right before news radio, he was on that Fox baseball show.  And we used to meet at the athletic club after he would rap.  And we would shoot pool.  He's really good, right?  What's the story there?  His family owned it?  Or he worked at one?  I'm trying to remember.  It's a hobby for him.  It's like chess for him.  I'm talking about back in the day.  Yeah, he really likes it.  He looks like the kind of guy that would think out the angles.  Yeah, he knows himself. 
[03:03:00]  He knows the angles.  And he's very intelligent in the sense that he gave his pool table to charity or something.  And I said, why?  And he goes, because I would leave the comedy store and go home and shoot pool until 6 in the morning by myself.  He's one of those guys.  He had a pool table in his apartment.  In his apartment.  And the neighbor downstairs.  That's how crazy he is.  Yeah, he's crazy.  I traded my desk chair when I moved from L.A. to New York.  I gave him this big godfather desk chair I had.  And he gave me a Richard Black pool cue.  I still got it.  Nice. 
[03:03:30]  He was hooked on the game, Quake.  Oh, he was playing Quake.  How he got into Quake.  Quake.  He would go home at night.  That's old school.  He got rid of all that shit.  One day I go over to breakfast cereal.  No, one day I go over there and he gives me this computer.  This monster.  He goes, take it home with you.  I can't have it.  He's hilarious.  I brought it home.  My wife was like, what the fuck is that thing?  I don't know.  She goes, that's for my fucking game or NASA and shit.  I mean, this thing where you put it on, the whole house would warm up.  Crazy gaming computer. 
[03:04:00]  Why am I sweating in the fucking winter?  Because this computer he had, he was playing Quake across the world with Chinese people and Arabs.  He was on there fucking playing Quake with them and shit.  But that's how he catches himself.  He's like, you know what?  I have an addictive person now, so now I think he's got the pool table back.  And he had it because of the kids and the wife.  But he's great.  You're right.  No, that's his thing.  No, we go on the road, we go, we do the comedy show, we go eat.  And then he'll say, what do you want to do?  You want to go shoot a pool? 
[03:04:30]  And Ari will get stuck with him.  Ari, and then I'll talk to Ari, and I'll say, what'd you do?  He had me at the pool hall until 8.15 in the car.  Yeah, that's what he said.  Yeah, he loves it.  We used to shoot until it closes.  He'll shoot until it closes.  It was great.  I miss it.  He came all the way to Santa Monica in his Porsche.  We shot, we bullshitted about cars and caught up.  It was really nice.  Oh, God, I can play maybe two games.  Two games.  Two games.  I got to get out because I suck.  And he's not drinking.  You know, there's people that shoot pool and they're drinking.  It's all about having a serious.  He's fucking just playing, drinking Red Bulls, eating fucking Alpha Brains, you know, just 
[03:05:00]  pooling on a motherfucker.  Good for him.  Good for him.  No, it's great.  All right, we're going to start our weekends.  Yeah, let's get it.  Love you, man.  Thank you very much for having me.  Great seeing you guys.  It's been way too long.  We'll see you next time.  And, of course, Adam, what can I say?  Be good, my friend.  All right.  We'll see you guys Monday.  I want to take this opportunity to thank you all for listening to the Opie and Anthony  show.  You know, as always, we as people enjoy the things we enjoy, but all good things must 
[03:05:30]  come to an end.  And as we reach the conclusion of the Opie and Anthony show, instead of being sad, we  can look forward to what comes next.  So remember to think of this not as the end of dirty jokes, but the beginning of the whole  new set of ones.  Till next time, take care of yourself. </pre>
