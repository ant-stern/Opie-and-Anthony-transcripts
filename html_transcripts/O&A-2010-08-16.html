<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts bragging about their show's superiority, followed by complaints about a "bassy" audio issue.  They then discussed Dustin Johnson's controversial penalty at the PGA Championship.  The conversation took a graphic turn, detailing a medical show featuring a woman with a massive 200-pound tumor, and then shifting to equally graphic descriptions of "Hoarders," focusing on the participants' hygiene and laziness. This led to several incoherent listener calls.  A bizarre news story about a pea plant growing in a man's lung was discussed, followed by more listener calls, including one detailing a 179-pound tumor removal (jokingly referring to his wife), and a nurse caller providing medical information on tumor growth.  A lengthy segment detailed Jimmy's argument with his girlfriend over a late-night text. The show concluded its first major segment with Jimmy bringing in a large collection of unopened and partially used cologne, leading to a humorous discussion about selling them, interjected with a disgust-inducing story about a chewed pen.  He also planned to give away a speaker system, camera, and various health and beauty products, prompting discussion about his potential for hoarding, and ending with more listener calls.

The next segment continued the cologne discussion, focusing on a $10 sales strategy.  They debated the value of various items, including Burt’s Bees and detox foot pads. Jimmy expressed anxiety about selling his colognes, revealing he owned many more. The conversation shifted to the "wrestling death clock," discussing Lance Cade's death and speculating on contributing factors like steroid use.  Wrestling expert Sam Roberts provided details.  The segment then detailed Dustin’s street sales of Jimmy's cologne, including a sale to "Madonna Mike," who seemingly stole a bottle.  The hosts then critiqued comic strips like *Doonesbury* and *Beetle Bailey*, followed by crude and offensive remarks about overweight teenagers in a weight-loss camp.  Listener calls followed, with individuals sharing experiences with weight issues and emotional eating.  The segment ended with a brief mention of the David Hasselhoff roast.

The following segment focused on the proposed mosque near Ground Zero, the public's reaction, and President Obama's response.  The hosts and callers debated the mosque's location, legality, and political ramifications, using frequent offensive language.  The conversation broadened to include politics, taxes, and economic policy, focusing on Bush tax cuts and strong opinions, often offensive, about the Democratic and Republican parties, specific politicians (Obama, Pelosi, Bloomberg), and government spending.  The debate included disagreements about taxation and stimulus. A caller recounted giving up a bus seat, and another mentioned Webex in Anthony's backyard as an example of potential tax increases.

The show continued with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton (in studio) discussing Ant's resentment towards those who don't work for their money. The conversation shifted to Greg Giraldo's successful roast of David Hasselhoff, and the exclusion of Jim Norton.  Pam Anderson and Jeff Ross were mentioned with crude jokes. Jim Norton's bad review of *Eat Pray Love* was reviewed, leading to criticism of a female blogger, Sarah Arboleda, for her critical blog post.  The hosts read excerpts and reacted with anger and mockery.  A male caller discussed the lack of male-centric "self-discovery" films.  The conversation continued with more crude jokes, a technical issue involving producer Steve, and a caller describing a "wake and bake," leading to discussions about drug use. The segment ended with commentary on a police chase shown on a news broadcast, accompanied by further crude jokes.

Finally, a phone call with Amy Thornton from Montgomery, Alabama dominated the last segment.  The conversation involved sexually explicit and vulgar discussions of Amy's drug use (Xanax, marijuana), sexual practices (including rectal drug injection), and family life, including her cousin's relationship.  The hosts tried to find Amy's Facebook profile.  The conversation included numerous references to dildos and other sex toys, offensive racial slurs, descriptions of Amy's appearance with sexually suggestive comments, and jokes about her drug use and lifestyle.  The segment ended with further sexually suggestive comments and jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  It's entertaining as fuck.  How many people are screaming at their radios right now? 
[00:00:30]  It doesn't get better than this.  It's just the stupidest, most fun.  I can't get enough of this.  I would eat your poo.  You know, let's be honest with each other.  No one's doing better radio than this.  We rule.  Google it.  You're fucking right.  Simple as that.  Fucking believe it.  This is radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do it.  Monday morning.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  That was everyone's weekend. 
[00:01:00]  Good idea.  Your mic sucks.  What's the matter with it?  I don't know.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Very bassy.  A little lower in the mix.  You can always count on it being bassy.  Get it?  Counts bassy.  Yuck.  Starts off the week with a bomb.  Actually, I didn't get it.  Yeah.  You don't hear that?  No.  It actually just sounds like it always does.  Kind of.  No?  Well, by C. 
[00:01:30]  I can't tell the difference.  I can't tell the difference right now.  If it don't bother you, then actually...  Well, whatever.  I think it all sounds a little...  Something's different.  Something's different.  Yeah, something's different.  I noticed something's different.  I don't know why that has to be, but...  It sounds a little fuzzy.  It does, right?  That's what someone's saying.  Mars!  There's some kind of distortion.  Oh, Mars!  A little...  Yeah, there's some distortion of some sort going on. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, whatever.  I don't know.  Don't fuck the wine, though.  Hilary Swank.  Huh?  Look at Hilary Swank.  Hilary Swank wasn't good in the paper, too.  Yeah, she's fantastic.  Yeah, not looking bad.  Bickany.  Very sexy.  A little bickany.  How was the weekend, you said?  Nothing crazy?  Yeah, nothing crazy going on.  Basic weekends for everybody.  Basic.  Watching some horrible television. 
[00:02:30]  You watch golf?  Like that.  No, I didn't watch golf.  I hear it was a big to-do.  Well, you know, we had another major.  The last major of the year.  Last big fiesta of the year.  And Tiger kind of just was there once again.  Just watching.  And the story this year is, we joked about it, but now they're talking about how this was the year of the young guns.  Ah.  The year of the young guns, as far as golf goes.  Up-and-comers, I guess.  A lot of up-and-comers playing very well. 
[00:03:00]  But this guy, Dustin Johnson, got so fucked yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.  Another athlete getting just so fucked.  Yeah.  He's leading the tournament.  One hole to go.  He pars it.  He wins.  He bogeys.  He goes into a playoff.  Okay?  He ends up with a bogey.  So now he's going to be in a three-way playoff for the PGA Championship.  For the biggie.  Right.  And just a little knowledge on Dustin Johnson.  He was leading the U.S. Open, another major, by three strokes, I think it was, going into the final day. 
[00:03:30]  And shot an 81 and just had one of the worst collapse.  Meltdown.  Collapses in recent memory as far as golf goes.  So here he has a chance to redeem himself.  Yeah.  And so he makes the bogey, three-way tie for the playoff.  Then the rules officials get involved.  And they were saying his second shot on the 18th hole, he was in some kind of sand trap.  But when you play golf, you know when you're in a sand trap, this course is so fucked up. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Unkept.  I saw, like, grass.  But he hit it and sand came out.  Yeah.  But, you know, when you play and you might be sort of on a car path or in an area of a golf course where there's no real grass, he was kind of in one of those areas.  There's no rake.  There's no real indication that it's a sand trap.  And now I'm hearing two things, Travis.  Someone said he grounded his club.  But I'm also hearing that the caddy put the bag in the sand trap. 
[00:04:30]  Well, I know that he was penalized the two strokes because he grounded his club.  That's the official thing.  Okay.  So that's the official thing.  So if you're in a sand trap, you can't ground your club.  So they determined that this was indeed a sand trap.  And what is grounding your club for the layman?  Just kind of touching the ground.  You can't touch the ground?  When you're in a sand trap.  No, you cannot.  You can't really take practice swings while you're in a sand trap.  Right, right.  You know, so instead of being tied and going into the playoff, two-stroke penalty, he doesn't 
[00:05:00]  get a chance to win the PGA Championship.  So, and people were standing in this, like, area that, you know, there it is right there  real fast.  It's supposed to be.  Yeah, that ain't a sand trap.  And now there's the official.  Oh, the official's talking to him.  He's like, oh, boy.  You see how he just put the tip of the club down on the sand?  That's a stroke, believe it or not.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, it's just ridiculous.  Gotta stick to the rules here at Bushwood.  What did it look like?  Just kind of like a... 
[00:05:30]  It looked like dirt.  Just dirt.  Some kind of dirt where there was no grass or some shit.  So they fucked this guy, Dustin Johnson, but now everyone knows his name today because  it's a huge story as far as sports and golf goes, so.  A bunch of snabs.  Golf snabs.  So, yeah, two-stroke penalty.  He doesn't get a chance to win it.  Yeah, well, poor bastard.  Poor, poor bastard.  Big news.  Big news in golf.  Big news.  So we had this German win instead. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Cayman or something like that.  What's his name?  Schnancy?  Yeah, Camer, right.  Martin Camer wins the PGA Championship, so.  Good for him!  So that's that.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, as opposed to, I mean, otherwise, I was just watching a lot of these stupid medical  shows that I say I don't watch because I get the heebie-jeebies.  You end up watching.  Like, sometimes you switch and buy, and I watch this show with this woman that had a 200-pound 
[00:06:30]  tumor.  She weighed 96 pounds, I swear to you, after it was removed.  She weighed 96 pounds.  She was a 300-pound woman, basically?  It was 200 pounds of tumor.  And then she was, like, emaciated when it was done, and they cut it out of her.  Where was it?  It was all over her back and then around her side to the front.  Oh, okay.  Imagine if it was just hanging from her ear, a 200-pound tumor from your earlobe. 
[00:07:00]  It was so disgusting.  Like, it was, how do you get it out?  How do you not go to the doctor at that point?  I know a lot of us don't really like going to the doctor's office, but when do you finally  realize, maybe I have a problem?  And she had a husband and a kid and everything, so you'd think they would be like, hey, you  gotta get that tumor checked out.  You got a 200-pound tumor, or at least, you know, 100-pound tumor when it gets to 100  pounds.  But they showed these doctors, like, I guess when you get these things, veins and arteries 
[00:07:30]  just start growing to feed it.  And they're cutting it, and you're just seeing blood squirting up.  And I'm like, why am I watching this?  Yeah, why are you watching that?  I don't know.  It was horrible.  That, and then, of course, Hoarders is one of my favorites.  Oh, my God.  Do I love the Hoarders shows?  They were on last night.  And it's just, they're all from the same mold.  They're fat people.  They're just a lazy bums. 
[00:08:00]  They can't fucking get the shit out of their house.  Just collecting shit that means nothing.  They did nothing.  And everything's important.  And then the shrink's got to come over and coddle them.  They've got to coddle them and go, okay, we'll start with these pencils.  The whole place is a fucking disaster area.  And they've got to start with these pencils.  Do you want to get rid of this?  Really?  It means a lot to me.  My stress level's at a 10. 
[00:08:30]  Just throw the pencils out right in front of the person.  Yeah, just snap them and throw them at their face.  I think the therapists have more problems than the Hoarders.  Oh, believe me.  They're all a bunch of kooks.  That you're willing to sit there and deal with that crap.  You have to have a major problem.  The friggin', the Hoarders family, that's her tumor.  Look, you can't even see.  What is it?  That's her back.  Yeah, it's her back and her side.  She's in a walker, so you can see her leg coming down.  Her entire back and side and front is covered with this tumor. 
[00:09:00]  You think she had an achy back?  Oh, her back was achy.  You know how bad she must have smelled?  It looks like a huge potato.  Yeah, she does.  She looks like a giant potato.  Just a giant potato.  Oh, with some rotting eyes on it.  That's disgusting.  Oh, her pussy must stink.  You know how bad tumor pussy smells?  Oh!  But they were able to remove that whole thing.  Yeah.  So where's her skin now?  Oh, they made some new skin from cadaver skin. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, really?  They took cadaver skin and cut it into strips, and then they put these, like, perforations  in it, and then pull it over her wounds, and then her skin kind of grows through it.  Right.  Ew.  But, you know, it just looks like she was beaten with a waffle iron.  Yeah, that's pretty gross.  Did they show her face?  Well, yeah, they showed her face.  Did you show your face?  No.  She looked thin as a pin. 
[00:10:00]  And then they showed her two years later or some shit, and she was big and fat.  Really?  She even got big and fat.  Ew.  I know.  Just...  Well, maybe the stress of this whole thing.  That's her Lori, Lori...  Whatever it is.  How do you sleep on a tumor?  Lori, who...  You don't think she slept on her back?  No.  You can't...  Little feet would kick like a lamb.  Right.  That's her...  Yeah, that's her after she had it removed.  She's like...  She's like 90 pounds.  Damn. 
[00:10:30]  What channel was this on for the peeps?  Oh, this was one of those friggin' science channel things, which is just turning into the  medical freak show channel.  Who's that guy?  Oh, her father.  Okay, I hope she doesn't have a husband.  All of the...  She does have a husband.  Somebody was fucking her?  And a kid.  Yeah.  Well, maybe not at that point.  Maybe not with the tumor.  How long did it take to grow?  Maybe they were just comfortable with each other.  It was like years.  Years to grow.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  And then...  You think it started with a zit?  Dude, it has to start small. 
[00:11:00]  No one wakes up with a giant tumor.  Like a mole that's looking a little funny?  Oh, God.  Well, she said after that, about a few months after that, she had something growing on her.  Really?  She was all scared it was going to be that again.  And what was it, cancer?  Nah, the doctor just lopped it off.  Said, don't worry about it.  Don't sweat it.  What are you doing?  Let me say hi to Tim in Maine.  Tim, first call of the week.  Make it good.  Why would he?  Starts out with a bang. 
[00:11:30]  Listening.  He was listening to the show.  Listen to himself.  Why did he do that?  There's no reason.  None of them have anything to say.  Once in a while, they get lucky and it's good.  But I make a motion that we fucking unplug the phones or change the number.  You can't do a talk show without phone calls.  We talk to each other.  Let Danny go in there and call.  You can't do it.  Sam, call us in the next room.  You truly can't do a talk show without fucking phone calls.  Jesus Christ, Tim.  I know it's Monday and all, but come on.  How about Troy Kwan from the other room? 
[00:12:00]  You're on the line.  No wonder people pay people to have phony phone calls in.  They feel like just phony phoners.  Hey, you listen to any other talk show out there.  You don't have half the shit we deal with.  I know.  What's wrong with these people?  It's just amazing.  Did they just start listening to us or something?  I don't know.  It's bizarre.  You listen to your phone.  When you call in, listen to what's in your phone, not the radio.  Right.  There's a delay.  Why would you use this?  Yeah.  Why would you use the radio to decide when you need to talk when you have the phone up to your ear? 
[00:12:30]  I don't get it.  You hear, hi, you're on the air.  And then you go, you wait, you wait.  You lean over to look at the radio.  Ah, dopes.  It says, but Ant, how will they hear themselves?  Exactly.  The more important thing is that they hear themselves.  Yeah.  They want to be convinced that they're on the radio or something.  I don't know.  Whatever.  We're on a delay for you dummies out there that still haven't figured this out.  Show us to go into outer space first.  And then comes back around.  Takes a while. 
[00:13:00]  Whatever.  I think the lawyers get a shot at it, too.  Yeah.  It's going to run through their office.  I think it goes upstairs before it goes to the satellite, then back down, back to the lawyers to make sure they got it right.  And then finally to your big rig.  Speaking of medical shit, did you hear about the, I'm not sure if it was a woman or a guy like in matters thought that he or she had lung cancer.  It turned out to be a pea that was growing.  Oh, God.  Somehow, somehow they fucking inhaled a little pea and a little fucking little pea tree was fucking growing in their lungs. 
[00:13:30]  Like a little viney thing.  Yeah, a little viney thing.  Imagine thinking you got the lung cancer and that's a bad one.  And then it turns out it's just a fucking pea growing in your fucking lung.  That was last week.  Do we have that story?  There it is.  A pea plant.  Bean sprout.  Sprouts inside.  Okay, it was a man.  A man's lung.  Guy had edamame growing in him.  Pea plant inside a man's lung.  A 75-year-old man. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, fuck.  75-year-old man from Massachusetts was rushed to a hospital with a collapsed lung and came home with a surprising and unusual diagnosis that a pea plant was growing in his lung.  Ron Sveton had been suffering from emphysema for months when his health condition deteriorated.  He was bracing himself for a cancer diagnosis when x-rays revealed the growth of green vegetable in his lung.  How does that happen?  One of the first meals Sveton had in the hospital after surgery had peas for the vegetables. 
[00:14:30]  He just laughed and laughed to himself and ate them.  The patient said the plant was about half an inch in size.  The story continues, but you get the basics there.  How does it get the nourishment to grow?  You know?  Doesn't it need something that your lungs can't fucking give the plant?  I think your lungs are kind of moist, aren't they?  Yeah, that's all you need.  Yeah.  Cancer grows there fine.  Miracle soil.  I'm not breathing.  Didn't they used to sell miracle soil where you could, like, grow? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, miracle grow.  Or, not even that.  What was the one thing you could grow plants in, like, sponges and stuff?  A hydroponic garden?  I don't know.  You didn't really need dirt and you could get the plants growing?  Just grow it in a lung?  Mm-hmm.  There's so much creepy medical shit going on.  This guy wants to yell at you because the tumor story is old.  Sorry that we brought it to your attention today.  Rob, Garden City.  No, I'm not mad that it's old.  I mean, if that's the first time he saw it, then that's the first time he saw it.  Well, and saw it on TV.  I saw a documentary on it last night, my friend. 
[00:15:30]  Why the bitterness?  No, I'm not upset.  I'm just calling just to tell you that.  I don't know if they said it in the documentary or not, but they also found, like, parts.  They found molars inside the tumor.  They found wads of hair, fingernails.  It grows, like, weird parts of your body.  They can, like, replicate, you know, a strands or whatever.  Yeah, that's weird.  When you have some of these tumors, your body gets really confused and just decides, oh, you must be fucking growing a person.  So here's some hair. 
[00:16:00]  Here's some teeth.  You figure it out.  Just kind of throws it in the middle of the tumor.  Yeah, I've heard that shit before.  I think that was a different tumor story, my friend.  I don't know.  A lot of these tumors, I think, have some of this shit in it.  I was going to say, the reason why she didn't leave her house for so long was because after she started having a massive tumor growing on her,  started getting, like, agoraphobic and didn't want to leave the house.  Like, she became, like, couch-ridden or bed-ridden or whatever, and then it just started, like, consuming her...  With an enabling husband.  My favorite fat stories are the ones where the woman, it's usually a woman, gets so fat that she's stuck to the couch. 
[00:16:30]  That was the best, one of the best ones.  Yeah, the fat just decides to attach itself to the couch.  To the material.  How do you not leave a couch for a year or two?  She grew around her couch cushions like the trees grow around rope signs.  Yeah.  Who's enabling that?  Who's feeding that?  People that just come by and shovel food into their mouths thinking they're doing the right thing.  Who's wiping that?  Same thing with the stupid hoarders. 
[00:17:00]  Same goddamn thing.  The enabling that goes on.  It's okay, yeah.  And then there's the husband, miserable, stepping over shit, like, trying to fucking find the microwave oven.  It's under stuff and not just belting her in the mouth.  She can't help it, you know?  She's sick, you know?  Who's the bigger problem?  She is.  She or he?  She is.  But every guy in that situation is a pussy whipped asshole to not just say, get the fuck out of here. 
[00:17:30]  While she's sleeping, throw everything out the windows.  I think there'd be hell.  Just throw shit out the windows and let her lose her fucking mind.  And in the end, what will really happen?  She'll lose her mind for a little bit and then what?  Yeah.  She'll just go back to collecting garbage again.  And then she just keeps coming back from the thrift store.  She kept going to the thrift store and buying just garbage.  I can't take the fucking hoarders.  Here's a guy that had one of those giant tumors removed, Anthony. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, God.  Bob, Long Island.  Hey, guys.  How we doing this morning?  Pretty good.  It's Monday, you know.  I know.  I know.  Listen, I had a 179-pound tumor removed from me.  I know what it's like.  The exact medical term, though, is called a wife.  But I tell you, it's great.  I got rid of it.  Wow.  What an experience.  I'm really feeling better.  Well, dude, were you close to death?  I could hear half of what you said.  Oh, I said the 179-pound tumor.  I heard you. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Shut up.  I knew that was coming.  Of course I did.  Oh, it was perfect.  Of course.  He was so eager to tell you again because it was so funny the first.  Holy shit.  Yeah, my wife, huh?  Let me tell you.  A tumor.  She's taking her on vacation somewhere.  She's never been like the kitchen.  That old gag.  Let's say hi to John in Ohio.  John.  Later, Jen.  Hey, good morning, fellas.  How are you? 
[00:19:00]  Good, man.  Good.  Hey, I was going to tell you about, you know, when people get tumors, you know, like you  were saying, it developed its own blood supply and then it just sucks all the nutrients  out of your body so you get really emaciated or skinny.  Yeah.  So then what happens is you get it taken off and you're used to eating a certain way,  then all of a sudden you're getting the nutrients back so you get fat again.  Really?  How about that?  Are you a nurse or something?  Yeah.  What are you?  Yeah, I'm a nurse.  All right, faggot. 
[00:19:30]  Why aren't you a doctor?  Well, I thought about it.  You know, I took me up.  Women are nurses.  Guys are doctors.  What are you doing?  You're fruity.  No, I'm not.  Do you wear little nurse shoes?  Yeah.  And the nurse bonnet?  Do you wear the hat with the red cross on it and give enemas?  Black stripes.  Are you the angel of death at least?  Yeah.  Do you smother some bitches every once in a while?  There's some people you'd like to be.  Yeah, no kidding, right? 
[00:20:00]  So anyway, but you know, look this up on Google, that tumors that have teeth and hair are called  a teratoma.  Teratoma.  Yeah, look up the images of that, man.  It's freakier than hell.  Oh, they have like eyes in them, right?  And hair growing in them?  Those teratomas?  Those teratomas.  Yeah, some of them have eyes.  A lot of them.  Oh, they do?  Some have eyes?  I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  They got a little arm on it.  Teratoma.  Wow, that's pretty cool, man.  They checked the chromosome studies on it.  They have like XX and Y chromosome or some kind of shit like that. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  It really fucked up.  Yeah, we're Google imaging that.  Pretty cool.  Oh, God damn it.  That is so fucking disgusting.  Is that molars?  We just found one with molars.  It's got good teeth.  Nice smile.  Yeah, it is.  Like quadto.  You like a tumor to have a nice smile.  Yeah, tumor.  Show me another good one, man.  Well, what's that butt all about?  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  Where's the ass?  This woman who has a tattoo where her ass should be, but there's no split where her 
[00:21:00]  ass is.  What does she go do to?  I mean, a tumor.  A tattoo.  I'm tired.  Oh, she's got a tramp bump.  Yeah, but her ass crack is gone.  Yeah.  There's nothing there.  Wait, it just fucking grow across the whole ass.  Maybe that's not a tumor.  Maybe that's all the duty building up.  She's duty building.  What is that on vagina?  What's on the vagina?  Ew, there's something going on down there.  Like it's got teeth or something.  Ew, a pussy has a teeth. 
[00:21:30]  What the fuck is that, man?  That's wild.  I'll come in for sex in a second.  I'm going to go brush my pussy.  I'm going to go floss her vag.  Yeah, long time listener.  Your mics sound like shit today.  I'm telling you, these mics really sound bad.  I don't know what changed over the weekend.  I'm used to it now.  Yeah, I'm used to it as well, but.  You know, I understand how someone could be a hoarder.  Like I was cleaning up my, because Keith was over him and Angie were going to do some  stuff in my apartment. 
[00:22:00]  And they looked in my closet and Keith laughed and took a picture of like what an ass I am  for saving.  No.  I have all these cords.  But I'm like, fuck it.  He's right.  I'm wasting a lot of space.  And I realized how hard it is to throw shit out, man.  It's like, you just want to say, like, I might, I might, you're never going to, I had  four empty fucking iPhone boxes.  Why were you hoarding those?  An excellent question.  I said to myself, and I threw them out.  What are you doing?  An old BlackBerry box.  I'm like, you're never going to use this.  Yeah.  What are you going to, why did you have them?  Dude, I don't, you put them away in case like you got to take it back, you got a box 
[00:22:30]  like for the first couple of weeks.  Right.  But Dan, like, what am I doing?  Then after a while, yeah, it's like, what the fuck?  I'm the other way.  I throw, like, when I get a new phone, I throw half the shit away.  Oh, you know, the cords that don't look like you need them?  Yes.  No, so I'm like, oh, fuck, I need that cord.  No joke.  I really do that.  You better off being that way.  Yeah.  Well, it comes from moving a lot.  You never moved a lot, right?  No, we moved once in my life.  See, when you move a lot, you have no choice because you're too poor to fucking haul all  your shit from one city to the other. 
[00:23:00]  You have to throw stuff away.  You have to make some split-second decisions on the front lawn.  Yeah.  As you're loading a U-Haul.  Yeah, I guess you don't get as attached to the stuff.  No.  You get attached to the stuff, actually?  But it's not like getting conscious attachment, but you're like, it's just there.  It's like, eh.  What else did you find yesterday that you realized you were saving?  It literally just towels.  Towels I never used.  I threw out, like, I put some stuff in if the guys want, like, colognes, like, 20 different  bottles of cologne.  They're good colognes, but I don't wear them.  Like, you haven't worn this in a fucking year.  Give it to somebody. 
[00:23:30]  Well, you're a borderline hoarder.  But I'm not.  Like, I just, you don't realize it.  It's like, I'm not that attached to my actions.  You got a lot of stuff in your apartment, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's why I'm throwing stuff out and just putting stuff in the closets.  I'm just...  His apartment's a bit crowded.  A bit, but it's not that bad.  It's better now.  Like, I spent...  I spent...  My girlfriend had a big fight the other night, so I fucking...  I worked till Sunday morning at 10 o'clock.  You do realize you say that a lot, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's all right.  I just...  Yeah.  I want to make sure it wasn't some kind of deja vu that I'm going through.  No, no, no.  Okay.  So, until 10 o'clock Sunday morning, I was just cleaning out my closet, like Eminem was 
[00:24:00]  inspiring me.  Yeah, cleaning out your closet.  And I went to bed.  I slept till 9 o'clock last night.  I just slept all day.  I find myself in mine a lot.  Yeah.  There's a little bit of hay for me to sleep.  What was the fight about?  Ah, it's just a build-up.  You know how it is.  It's just one of those things.  But it can't be a build-up if you're fighting a lot.  Yeah, man.  It's the old steam purge.  Yeah, they're never about anything... 
[00:24:30]  Important?  Honestly, no.  No?  I got a text and she was...  I'm driving with one hand and I'm trying to call my garage to open the door because it's  2 o'clock in the morning and they won't open the door unless you call or ring the bell.  So, I'm calling and a text came through.  And so, I'm like, you know, you drive with one hand and I'm swiping it and the text popped  up and I swipe back the other way.  And I'm annoyed because I'm trying to get to my phone and she thought I was trying to hide  the text.  Oh, shit.  And she's like, well, who's texting at 2.30? 
[00:25:00]  And she kind of accused asked me and it just annoyed me.  That she accused asked me.  And so, I was like, what are you asking me for that?  Like, why?  Like, I don't ask you who's texting you.  Like, normally you wouldn't have cared that much.  Yeah.  But she says like 2.30 in the morning.  It's like, it's a Friday night, first of all.  I'm a comic.  I'm up.  Yeah.  And everybody I know is fucking...  They're entertainers from the West Coast.  You know, whatever.  And it was a friend. 
[00:25:30]  But it wasn't anything inappropriate.  But it just annoyed me that she asked.  And then it became this thing where I was, fuck you.  I'm not telling you.  Mind your business.  Like, it was just so annoying.  How many hours was the fight?  I haven't talked to her.  She wound up leaving that night.  Wow.  She came back the next day, Saturday.  And we were talking.  We just started arguing more.  And I probably would have told her if she just wasn't, like, continuing with it.  But the fight just kept going.  And so, like, you know, she left.  A little too accusatory.  Yeah, it's really weird, man.  Those text things.  And I could say it now. 
[00:26:00]  But if she hears this, I don't want her to have the satisfaction of knowing who it was.  Person knows who they are.  Jesus.  Wow.  But it was almost like if she had asked me, it wouldn't have been a big deal.  Yeah.  It really would not have been, you know.  Mm-hmm.  But it's like just the accusing shit kind of annoyed me.  Like, what the fuck?  What do you want?  It happens a lot with people, couples and texts, always looking over kind of, what's  going on? 
[00:26:30]  Who is that?  Who cares?  It's a privacy.  It's really weird with me.  It's like, literally, it's not like, oh, God, don't.  But I don't want to see who's texting her either.  And it's not even, it's like, I want to.  But it's like, once you get into that, you're in this, you're in a possessive, obsessive thing.  And that's really a fucking unhealthy place to be.  Yeah.  Who was that?  What'd they want?  Gotta have a little trust, right, Jimmy?  Dude, I've been so untrustworthy in a lot of relationships.  So I'm not saying that my girlfriend's crazy to suspect.  But she didn't just say, look, I know it's kind of, can I just ask you who it was? 
[00:27:00]  I'm just bugging me.  That makes a huge difference between that and fucking, you know.  What are you trying to hide?  Like, you know what I mean?  It's like, then all of a sudden, you're on the defensive.  You're like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  So.  Someone texts, you're all of a sudden on the defensive.  It's like, what are you?  It's like, I'm a comic.  I'm not a fucking, I'm like, you act like 2.30 in the morning.  You act like I'm a lawyer.  It's Tuesday night.  It's a Friday night.  I'm a comedian.  My friend's up on the 11.30 in the West Coast.  I got a text from David Tell last night, which this is not the one we were fighting about.  Tell was texting me at fucking 2.27 a.m. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And he's like, hey, sorry.  I know you have to get up.  But it's like, the comics I know are all awake.  I got the picture of his cock.  It was nice, he said.  He's a good boy.  I know.  I have a couple of texts that were very late to James.  Happens.  Happens.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's like if someone asks you something, it's so much less angering. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Because then all the times it's just the way they ask.  You know what I mean?  And it's almost like then you get mad at me and say, well, what, you got to prove something  now?  But it's like, in a way, yeah.  It's like, I'm not, we're not a married couple for 20 years.  I don't want to behave like that.  And it's like, I don't know.  Yeah.  That's it.  You don't want to start falling into that.  So it's been a couple of days.  We talked yesterday morning, but it was a big argument, man.  And it's like, we'll see what happens.  Wow.  I don't even know what's going to happen.  Whatever.  That big?  Like.  Yeah.  Ooh. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  It happens.  You know, it happens.  You know.  We were okay without each other before.  I don't know what I want to happen, honestly.  I don't think she does either.  It's okay.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Dude, come on.  Get out.  Oh, come on, guys.  But anyway, that motivated me to clean up my closet.  Well, let's see the shit you brought in, man.  Well, you kind of got it right.  Some of it was good.  I know I bring in shit for the guys as well.  Drakkar.  I'm not stupid.  Well, who wears, do any of the guys wear cologne?  I don't even know if these guys wear cologne.  I wear cologne. 
[00:29:00]  Let me see what you got, Jimmy.  All right.  Cologne.  Wow.  Most of them have the boxes.  They're classy.  I don't think the younger guys wear cologne, do they?  I don't know.  I have a couple.  Seriously, I want to know the answer to that.  Do younger guys wear cologne?  When we were growing up, man, cologne was kind of important.  I don't know if it's as important nowadays.  This one is not a great one.  It's called Riverside Drive.  No, it isn't.  It is.  I don't think that's a great one.  Wait, throw it over here.  No, I can't get that.  Who cares if it breaks?  No, you don't want to break that. 
[00:29:30]  I don't know if it's...  Not in here.  Oh, and it's got a little NYC logo on there.  Yeah.  Someone got me next to those.  Those are cool.  I only have a couple.  These are ones that don't have any...  Put it on paper, Jimmy.  This is what they do at Macy's.  Oh, I know.  Oh.  Wait.  I have a couple that are loose.  I'll start getting fucking nauseous if there's too much smell in here.  I don't know.  It smells like a cheap version of Abercrombie and Fitch.  I have that too. 
[00:30:00]  I don't know.  You know what we should do?  What?  Take all your colognes and take, like, E-Rock.  Can we spray someone really bad and make them walk around the rest of the day with their  shitty colognes?  No, they'll think every time they come in here.  Who cares?  A lot of it.  It's expensive cologne, though.  None of these are terrible colognes.  This is not bad, actually.  I might take this one.  Okay, keep it.  No, I'm not taking your cologne.  That was a joke.  I can afford my own cologne.  No, but it's not...  Dude...  Give it to the guys, maybe.  This is literally 80% full, and it smells good, and it's not that this is bad cologne. 
[00:30:30]  I just...  I have, like, these ruts I get into.  I have, like, 40 colognes, and I brought in, like, 20 that I haven't used.  These are not shit colognes.  This one is, uh...  Here's a good one.  Dude.  Fucking, uh, Gucci.  It's an unused Gucci cologne.  Can I...  Here's what we do.  Wait, let me try that one again.  Take the fucking things, go into the bathroom with E-Rock, set them up on the counter with  some paper towels and a little basket, and see how much fucking money you make.  See how much fucking money you make.  Look at that cologne.  Extorting money out of the fucking serious stuff. 
[00:31:00]  How great would that be?  Oops.  Oops.  Uh, it would be good if Black Earl was still here to do it.  Dude, that's...  That's funny.  Let me smell the other ones.  Oh, God damn.  Here is, uh...  That one is a good one.  Now, this one is pretty good.  It's called, uh, Rojas.  Rojas?  Rojas.  Oh, that sounds manly.  Whoa, it's shaped like a butt plug.  Yeah, pass that to O.  That's not bad either, man.  That's actually a...  How the fuck you put that one on your counter? 
[00:31:30]  No, you have this, dude.  It looks like a cone upside down.  It looks like a little cone upside down.  It does look, um...  And it goes into something.  It looks like a carrot.  Yeah, your ass...  It looks like a carrot.  It looks like a carrot.  You could so shove that up your asshole.  Oh, please.  Could.  Smell the bottom.  This one's horse shit.  It's not.  No, it's not.  You smell it on the actual...  On the paper, it's not good, but I've worn it.  It's good.  Oops.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No.  And who likes Curve Cologne?  I started my own bit today. 
[00:32:00]  Oops.  No.  Anybody like Curve?  Oops.  Curve is good shit.  Well, it's yours.  It's yours.  I don't...  Curve is good shit.  I'm serious.  I know it is.  I just don't wear it.  It's almost a full bottle of Curve.  Someone should grab that.  I used to wear Curve.  It's great stuff.  That's some good stuff.  Where do you get all this?  I buy it when I'm on the road.  A lot of times I'm on the road.  It's like a compulsive thing.  It's like I'll be in a store and I'll see a...  I mean, I have like...  Give me that.  I have like...  Give them the butt plugged back.  I have like a bunch that are...  You buy them like, oh, that smells really good.  I'll buy one or two when I'm out. 
[00:32:30]  It's like a little stupid thing I like to do.  But then you don't realize that when you're home, you get caught up wearing one or two  really good ones.  And there's probably like four that I wear in rotation.  So I kept like 20 that I really like.  But I like this and Curve is good.  There's a lot of great ones.  I just don't wear them.  Curve is a good one.  They're all good.  Yeah.  These are ones I haven't worn in a year, the ones I'm bringing in.  But I thought the guys might want some because fucking...  If they wear cologne, do the chicks like them in cologne?  Sure.  You got any high karate?  No, I don't wear that fucking... 
[00:33:00]  I want high karate.  I don't wear that shitty stuff.  Oh, I get you.  Yeah.  What happened?  Get me something.  You want a cock?  What happened?  Someone fucking chews on the pen.  Oh, my God.  I'm so fucking grossed out.  And what happened?  I got to explain.  My love, what did you do?  So someone chews on this pen, right?  Yeah.  Now, I know when you're sharing pens around the workplace, you're going to get a pen that's 
[00:33:30]  chewed on.  But usually, you can work around it.  So I'm listening to Jimmy.  So I decide to go like this.  What?  I'm unscrewing the pen?  Unscrewing the pen.  Just a nervous little thing I was just doing, right?  Yeah.  And someone's fucking saliva pours out of his fucking thing.  Oh, fucking A.  Come on.  Who wants to smell my thumb right now?  Get the fuck out of here.  Who wants...  Iraq.  You want to smell my thumb?  Spell his thumb.  Spell his thumb.  Oh, my God.  Get me something.  Do you smell breath on it?  Oh, it's horrendous.  Oh, my God.  Here you go. 
[00:34:00]  Who does that?  No, no.  Get it away.  Get it away.  Get it away.  Dude, I'm sitting there listening to Jimmy talk about the cologne.  I'm listening to you talk about the cologne, and I just kind of unscrew the fucking pen up.  You know, I'm just sitting here enjoying the conversation.  And also, I'm like, why is my thumb getting really moist right now?  Fucking saliva just pouring out of this goddamn pen.  So someone's chewing on a pen, and it's just dripping into the pen?  It smells like...  Whose fucking pen?  Whose pen is that?  Who chews on the pen? 
[00:34:30]  I don't chew on pens.  Who chews on the pen?  I do a lot of weird shit.  Oh, you already cleaned it.  I do a lot of weird shit, but I don't chew on fucking pens.  What happened?  What?  The Purell machine's right there.  Oh, you just got some.  Yeah, I got some, and I'm fucking...  God damn.  Sorry, Jimmy.  I didn't mean to, like, take away from what you're doing here, but...  Dude, please.  Also, if I smelled spit on my thumb, I'd do the same thing.  But I'm sitting there like, why is my fucking thumb getting moist as I hold this pen?  All right.  Oh, I still gotta go fucking clean my hands, but whatever. 
[00:35:00]  Why don't you spray some cologne on them?  That'll smell better.  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.  Look at the curve.  Oh, my God.  It's still on my fucking thumb.  Anyway.  What else besides...  Wow, that is really rude.  What is that?  It's like a snow globe.  This is really good.  I think that smells...  They're very unique packaging there, Jimmy.  I think this is good.  Could you give this to Gregorio?  I don't know what that's called.  I don't even know how to open that.  Yeah, I do.  It does look like a snow globe.  It is a snow globe.  By the way, this is the Abercrombie cologne you mentioned.  Oh.  Ooh.  What, do you rub it on your abs? 
[00:35:30]  Oh, it smells good.  Dude, this doesn't smell like anything.  I think sometimes I lose potency.  Spray it on the pens.  Yeah, this one you could throw away, I think.  I don't think it smells like...  Oh, Mont Blanc.  Mont Blanc.  It's gone bad.  No, it doesn't smell like anything.  All the cologne we're spraying in here, though.  Who knows at this point?  Yeah, I can smell it.  It's good.  Yeah.  And Abercrombie.  Abercrombie's good.  Abercrombie.  Did you even use that?  Oh, yeah.  I've used all of them.  You know, I put that on the road. 
[00:36:00]  The Curve and the Abercrombie, some of these young gunslingers should bring that home with them.  Fahrenheit, a brand one, which E-Rock's dad gave me, which is nice, but I just don't wear it.  From Dior?  Yeah, I don't wear it.  Lacoste.  A Lacoste one, which is kind of a cheaper one.  Is it?  I wouldn't know.  I'm not a cologne guy.  I'm a, you know, I have a little speed stick.  A little speed stick.  You don't cologne up for the big dates?  Nah, you know, I use my caress soap and a shower and then a little speed stick under the arms and maybe a little hair gel. 
[00:36:30]  You never take a Puerto Rican shower?  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, Mars.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Mars.  I'm sorry.  Mars just calls it a shower.  A little, uh, hair mace.  Oh.  You got mace?  Hair mace.  Oh.  Hermes.  That's the shit you could use as mace.  You got a fuckload of cologne in that bag.  We're discovering that you really are a hoarder.  I think you're a hoarder.  I got a polo sport and, uh, aqua de giorgio by Armani. 
[00:37:00]  They're all good.  You got aqua velva.  That's really good.  No, it's yours.  There you go, sweetie.  Brand new.  It's not you.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Why would you give it to him before me?  Um.  I'm kidding.  Because he walks in and out wearing whatever cologne he is.  It's cum.  Sorry.  No.  Uh, Kenneth Cole is good.  Whatever.  I fucking do Kenneth Cole.  Pass that to my love.  Do you do the black?  I think that's black.  Kenneth Cole black?  I have no idea.  I kind of know a little too much about this shit, I guess.  Dude, this one's leaking, though.  No, it's not. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, shit.  I'm just trying to get it out.  No, it's going all over everywhere.  And, uh.  I don't want to get my sandwich.  Some more Lacoste.  Lacoste.  This is okay.  This is not.  You got any Stetson?  Some recommendations here.  Stetson, Jim.  That was a good one.  Danny, if you want one, you can take one.  You're not a Kologa?  I'm smelling.  Huh?  You don't do Kologa and Danny?  I haven't in a long time.  Yeah, I don't know.  I'll throw him out if nobody wants.  I don't care.  And Boss. 
[00:38:00]  A little bit of Boss.  Oh, Boss.  Boss.  That comes in a ball.  Yes.  It's unique.  Marge, which one are you picking?  I want to know what the Latinos.  How much money would you say you went through in Kologa?  This is probably a thousand dollars.  A thousand dollars worth, yeah.  Holy mother of Jesus.  That's got to be at least a thousand.  Yeah.  Amazing.  But I don't buy them at once.  Look at this stuff.  I know.  This is good stuff.  Fucking Mark Jacobs.  Answer on to something.  We should get all this in the bathroom today.  These are all full.  Yeah, it should all be set up in the bathroom. 
[00:38:30]  Or you could sell them on the street right now.  And just fucking...  With all the fucking zeros walking around, walking around this time of the day.  No one's going to buy fucking cologne down the street.  How much you want to bet?  Get me an intern with a big fucking sign that says used colognes for sale.  Ten dollars.  How much?  Ten dollars per.  I bet you you sell some right down the street.  There's the polo black.  Black.  Black.  Black.  I bought this song. 
[00:39:00]  Alfred's song.  It's a woman's perfume.  But you know who wears this and smells good is Dennis from the Bunny Ranch.  Always smells good.  I'm like, what is that you're wearing?  And he goes, it's fucking...  It's sung, but it's for women.  And he wears it because women like it.  And it's like...  Dude, he smells...  When he's banging all the fucking noobies that come in.  He smells really good.  Dennis from Huff smells great.  Let me smell.  This is just a cologne smorgasbord.  Yeah.  That doesn't smell as good.  It's a little chicky.  Yeah, I just rubbed it on myself.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, wow. 
[00:39:30]  Okay, that was...  I don't know, dude.  That might be worn out, too.  I just got nailed with some, like, major fucking cologne.  It smells very good on Huff.  But this is a chick's cologne.  It's perfume.  It's the only one I have that's perfume.  But he wears it just because girls like it.  I think that's almost all I got.  I got one more.  I like electric shave.  Cartier.  Cartier.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, it's good stuff, too.  Oops.  Real good stuff.  He just broke the top.  The little atomizer came off in Jimmy's little hand. 
[00:40:00]  I didn't know what happened, Anthony.  I know.  You got scared.  Oh, this is...  I should keep this one.  Wait.  Someone's saying you are displaying signs of a suicide victim.  What does that mean?  First of all, why?  Like, somebody go kill a Craigslist hooker?  Yeah, that guy killed himself in jail over the weekend, huh?  Why do you say that?  Who said that?  The Craigslist hooker guy.  Yeah, he killed himself in jail in Boston over the weekend.  But we got Richard in St. Louis.  Richard.  Hey, Obi.  Yeah, I'm starting to worry about Jimmy.  He's just now getting out of a relationship, and he's starting to give away all of his possessions. 
[00:40:30]  Those are two classic signs.  Oh, I think he's getting out of a relationship.  I don't know if we're going through that.  They had a tiff.  He's going with basic signs.  Yeah.  I got you now.  All right.  That's silly.  But who wants my signed Sabbath stuff?  Very good.  Imagine.  Yeah, you come over with that shit, then I would believe.  No, dude.  I actually kept about 20 of these.  This is excessive.  And the fact that I have so many, he's starting to give away all of his possessions.  He's listening to himself.  Oh, my God.  We're trying to continue to talk to you. 
[00:41:00]  Just hang up on him.  What is wrong with people?  The, um, Cartier I may keep.  Actually, there's one I like.  It's actually not bad.  Looks like a hoarder.  Yeah, but I'm giving away all of them.  I don't.  No, you're itching.  You're going to take half of them back now.  Dude, they're all pretty good.  They're all good, except the ones I kept at home are the ones I wear fucking.  I would take, uh, I would take the, uh, the Kenneth Cole.  I would take, uh, Curve is, I haven't done Curve in years.  Dude, it's a full bottle of Curve.  I'd Curve.  I want to remember what it smells like. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, this is a, and then the Abercrombie, even though it's for, uh.  You ever smell Curve in?  Anything else?  My, I have sensory overload in my old factory.  It really does smell like a Macy's.  You know what you need, though, bro?  You need fucking, uh.  What do you mean, Dan?  You need, uh.  No, you need to, uh, to, to smell coffee beans now.  In between it.  To, to, uh.  It won't smell good on the napkin.  It'll smell all right, though.  Oh, wow.  It's too strong.  I don't know.  There's so much.  I don't know if I'm. 
[00:42:00]  Floating in the air, it's gone.  It's a lost cause.  I don't know if I like Curve anymore.  It is a lost cause.  Oh, you want this thing?  Yeah, yeah, put that on.  I always keep the bottle.  Look at him.  Yeah, yeah, put it on.  No, that's the little thing that keeps it from spraying in the thing.  But I thought you were done with this.  I am.  I'm going to give it away, but I don't want to give it away and have it spray on somebody.  These things, I travel with them, so.  I guarantee you could sell these on the street in Times Square right now.  I keep the boxes because I travel with them, so you can't travel with a loose cologne in your fucking suitcase.  It'll spill.  You put it in a box and you wrap a sock around it.  This way it doesn't spill all over your luggage.  Remember we were talking?  Again, I throw all that shit away. 
[00:42:30]  No, I never do because I've learned the hard way.  I have to.  I travel with things carefully.  I don't want to open up my underwear.  You know what?  Put all your colognes back in a box.  You're going to need these.  I'm going to smell like cologne now.  No, I'll never need them.  Dude, I got too many.  I got a whole shelf of them.  What is this guy doing?  We've got a sign.  What do you want it to say exactly?  Where are we going to do it?  You want to do it outside?  Do it outside real fast.  Real colognes.  Before the real people are walking around Manhattan.  There are people that would love a bargain right now.  Just use colognes, $10 a bottle. 
[00:43:00]  These are real colognes.  Yes, these are real.  No, they could smell them even.  Yeah.  There's no way anyone's going to buy this.  I guarantee someone's going to buy it.  But they're going to think it's like fucking just water or piss.  It's really not.  No, they could smell it.  They could spray and smell.  Yeah.  And I have a little speaker system here.  I don't know if anybody wants it.  It's not that great.  It's an MP3.  It's the Century Speaker System.  Ha ha ha, yeah.  You're a doctor.  You put your iPhone or...  Yeah.  I probably got that as a gift at a festival or I bought it. 
[00:43:30]  I bought a lot of speakers for the road.  All right.  Let me describe this for everybody.  Oh, no.  No, don't break it.  I want to give it away.  No, it's in the garbage.  See, he's a hoarder.  He's a hoarder.  But I want to give it to people.  All right, here, here, here.  Here, don't break this stuff.  Here's your speaker system, you fucking...  That's wonderful.  I don't know...  Wait.  It's not broken.  Okay.  I don't know if it's any good or not, but nobody needs this stuff.  It was a soft landing in the garbage.  I have one in my bedroom, but it's a, like, Sony. 
[00:44:00]  That's probably much better.  Yeah.  I'd want to give these to fucking Bobo or one of those guys.  You know, just guys have nothing.  Anyone else getting sick of all the cologne that's floating in the air?  Yeah.  Got a buzz.  It's all mixing.  I have a little Kyocera digital camera.  Oh, look at that.  What?  Oh, it's not.  It's only four megapixels.  Does anybody need a camera from 1980?  Oh, my God.  You got a camera on this.  I've taken some good photos with this.  Even though your dumb phone has more than four megapixels.  I know.  So nobody will watch this.  That's the one I have. 
[00:44:30]  That's nice.  Who?  What?  Who are you bringing in?  Younger guys are wearing cool.  He wants your speakers, but he's afraid to come in.  Tell him to come in.  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  D-Boy earns his keep around here.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good.  Hey, D-Boy.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't it horrible?  What smells in here?  Do you want the speakers?  I don't know if they're any good or not.  Hey, there you go.  It's like Christmas.  Wait, do you need an iPod Nano band? 
[00:45:00]  No.  Jesus.  Do you need a Belkin Tune FM for iPod Nano?  It makes your iPad Nano pick up FM radio.  Oh, wow.  No one needs that?  All right.  Do you need some Kenoki Cleansing Detox Foot Pads?  What's wrong with you end up with that?  Somebody gave them to me.  It's like a Christmas stocking stuffer.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I throw all that shit away.  As soon as they leave the house.  Does anybody need... 
[00:45:30]  Oh, look.  Another...  A little...  D-Boy, get back.  You have more century speakers.  Look.  Oh, they're little speakers.  These are teeny ones, which are good for travel.  Yeah.  These are little travel speakers.  Or headphones.  Yeah, or headphones.  You know, you're just...  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy's got a whole bunch of stuff in a big bag.  What else you got in there, Jimmy?  Some Burt's Bees Remedy.  What is that?  I buy a lot of Burt's Bees stuff, and I realize I hate it. 
[00:46:00]  What is Burt's Bees?  You've never seen Burt's Bees?  It's natural.  It's actually not bad product.  They have a bunch of shit.  Yeah, but this is the one.  I took the stuff I wanted.  So this has got Burt's Bees Body Lotion, Burt's Bees Rescue Ointment, and two things  of Burt's Bees Hand Salve.  If anybody's...  Hand salve.  I think you were doing radio, you hit a lot of buttons, anybody here, and the guys  in the back, whose fingers might be chafed, need some hand salve.  Hand salve.  And then this Aztec.  I bought this on the road not long ago. 
[00:46:30]  It's a speaker.  It's a single speaker for a laptop, an external, but I just got a better one.  Oh, an Altec Lansing.  An Altec Lansing.  Is that good?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Well, if anybody wants it, I didn't like it.  I got another one.  Wow, you got a lot of stuff on it.  I'll throw it out.  I'm not attached to it, but I'm like, if you're going to throw shit out, you might  as well just see if anybody wants it first.  If they don't, then you toss it.  Yeah, if someone wants cleansing, detox foot pads.  I'm looking at all your stuff.  You should open up a kiosk at a mall.  Jimmy's Kiosk or something. 
[00:47:00]  Jimmy's Kiosk.  Because it's all just nicky-nacky stuff.  Well, it's just, you know, I figured...  I mean, the Burt's Bees, I know, I'm kind of joking, nobody's going to want that, or foot  pads.  Well, we're taking your cologne, and we're going to try to sell it on the street.  The idea about fucking putting E-Rock in the bathroom is...  I know, it just doesn't...  No one around here has a sense of humor, so...  I know.  That's the only reason.  Do you know what a laugh that would get to people?  They'll probably go, well, we've got to check with the lawyers, because now you're...  Yeah, yeah, you're conducting a business in their personal space, and you've got the 
[00:47:30]  right forms.  Let them name the price.  Use colognes, $10, I'm telling you.  $10 or best offer.  Don't be heartened.  If they say, I'll give you a buck for the curve...  No, no, keep it at $10, and then they negotiate with you, then you have the power to negotiate.  Okay.  Let's try to make some real money off this.  Well, they might see the $10 and not even want to approach you.  Yeah, because as soon as you say best offer, then no one is going to give up the $10.  That's true.  Why would you give up the $10?  Yeah, but if they see the $10, but want it, but don't want to spend $10, they might not  even come over to say hi to them.  No, they'll go, I'll give you $5, and then you go, I'll give you $7. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, I'll take $7.  Ah, I'll give you $6.  Let people know you're willing to negotiate.  No, just leave it used, $10.  Okay.  Just take which one?  Because as soon as you say, or best price, no one is going to get close to $10.  If you see someone look, though, and turn away and keep walking, go, hey, hey, it's negotiable.  All right, yeah, that's a good way to do that.  Kind of let them know.  Because you want to get a couple dummies that don't know that they can negotiate and hand  over their $10.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, birds, bees, nobody will want that. 
[00:48:30]  Someone might want some hand salve.  I should put really awful prices on these.  This curve is $135.  Because Jim Norton used it.  Who exactly?  Do I want to keep this one?  God, I hope the NYPD arrests you.  That would be funny.  Look, he's trying to decide if you want to keep it.  No, I don't.  No, because it was a gift.  No, that's not it.  We got all these colognes over here.  Who said is that it?  Of course Steve did.  Steve, there's 90 things on this table.  Is that it? 
[00:49:00]  He said that when he saw a vagina.  Here, look.  I'm kidding.  Put these.  These are good.  Fahrenheit is on you.  That's a brand new thing of Fahrenheit.  I just don't wear it.  And Marc Jacobs, can you not put the bag in my food?  All right.  Thanks, man.  What about that brown box?  All these are going.  Cartier, I may keep.  This one, you have to hold it from the top.  Dude, you have to hold this from the bottom.  This is an unused Abercrombie & Fitch.  I've used it a couple times.  When did you buy that one?  That might be about less than a year ago.  Sometimes I buy them on the road if I forget them.  Might be the latest Abercrombie & Fitch that's out there. 
[00:49:30]  No, it's not.  What about that gray box in front of you?  No, that's the only one I'm going to keep.  The Cardiacs, I actually do kind of...  Let me see.  I'll never wear it here.  I like it, but I won't wear it.  It's like...  At home, I got fucking...  Is this a good exercise for you?  Dude, I'm not...  You're cleansing your soul right now?  I have like 15...  Getting rid of your smells?  I have...  I'm going to say I have 20 colognes at home still.  Wow.  But I cleaned off, made some shelf space.  This is unreasonable, but you can't...  I travel with a fucking...  What's wrong with me?  Listen to me. 
[00:50:00]  I'm panicking.  You're panicking because you're seeing your colognes go bye-bye.  I travel...  I'm panicking.  No, but I take a lot of time...  You might have a little bit of a hoarding thing happening.  I collect...  But I'm also good at cleaning and getting rid of stuff.  Like, I'm not...  You still have 20 colognes at home.  But they're actually colognes that I do occasionally wear.  That means you're probably not going to use at least half of those still.  People have to realize, too, I go on stage.  So it's like you come off.  You don't want to stink.  So a lot of times I wear it when I'm on the road.  It's like, you know...  And people are like, oh, you smell nice. 
[00:50:30]  It's like, it's nice you have to even fucking sweat like a pig for an hour.  But I take a...  I just found a bunch of, like, those little portable colognes.  You know the little samples they give you?  Yeah.  But they're great because I travel with the...  How many of those do you got at home?  Probably 12.  But those are great because I bring them.  Because you can't carry a big cologne in your luggage if it's carry-on.  Because they'll make you throw it out.  So all these colognes are useless because you can't really take them on.  He's been home, though.  Yeah.  But you said you bought them on the road.  I did.  But a lot of times if I have big luggage with me, if I'm checking my bag, you can bring any cologne you want. 
[00:51:00]  But if it's when you do carry-on, like when I'm doing Leno or whatever I'm doing...  I'm sorry.  I'm falling apart.  You really are.  I'm really...  I'm in a weird, loopy sleep schedule.  Really?  I went to bed at 2.20 last night.  Wow.  I cleaned out more of my...  That was when I did the cologne.  Yeah.  It was last night.  I did this all last night.  You went to bed at 2.20.  Ask Keith the cop for his photo.  He took a photo of my fucking...  I have like electrical...  I have like three things of electrical cords that I'm never going to use.  I'm like, why don't I just throw them out?  Yeah, you don't need those.  I have a phone cord that's like 12 feet. 
[00:51:30]  Like, why am I saving that?  Wait, wait.  Like a spirally phone cord?  No, like...  Oh, just phone cord.  One that will plug into a modem.  Oh, okay.  But I'm like, I probably won't use that.  Oh, you won't use that.  All right.  Yeah, you got to get rid of that stuff.  Why don't we take a break and continue?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got to eat.  We got to get...  We got to get Sam in here because bad news as far as the wrestling death clock goes.  We started a goofy bit a little while ago, but now it's not even a goofy bit anymore. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, it was a big one.  We'll explain after the break.  And also, Obama.  Yep.  Getting a lot of people outraged today.  He just doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut sometimes.  And I think he missed the point completely on this one.  Yeah.  We'll explain.  But first, Danny handed over a little mashup.  We haven't played any mashups in a while, but you found one with Nirvana and the Jackson 5.  Yeah, it was interesting.  I mean, I haven't heard a good one in a while.  I mean, that trend kind of came and went, but this one was kind of interesting, so I figured  we could give it a shot. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, let's play it into break.  Yeah, let's play it into break. 
[00:53:00]  I'm worse than what I do best before I skip my fingers.  A little glue.  It's always been, always weird until the end.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  It's always been, always weird until the end.  I'm so sorry.  You're so sorry.  It's only hurt.  It's always been, always weird until the end.  We'll be right back. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah! 
[00:54:00]  I'll taste them, yeah, I guess it makes me smile 
[00:54:30]  I found it hard, it was hard to find  Well, whatever, never mind  The virus, Sirius XM 
[00:55:00]  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony  Do, do, do, do  O.P. and Anthony  Yep  That's when the peppers were really good  Old school peppers, right?  Yeah  Dig the old peppers 
[00:55:30]  This was before Under the Bridge and all that other stuff  Although, uh  Yeah, even off that album is okay  Blood Sex Magic  Blood Sugar Sex Magic  That's right, Blood Sugar Sex Magic  I hated them  I hate the peppers  You don't like the peppers?  Not my style  I mean, I know they're good, but they're just  Not my style  You don't like that slapping?  I like this old stuff  It's good  Anything new  Or past few years  We're going right to the streets  Yeah  Because Dustin has gotten his first sale  I told you 
[00:56:00]  Dustin!  Morning  Hey  Hey, what's up, Dustin?  Not much  I made my first sale to a taxi driver  To a taxi driver  Oh, shit  I didn't even think of those savages  You're right  Which one did he buy?  Yeah  The Lacoste  We've all floated  Okay  How much did he get?  Ten bucks  See, I told you  Dude, I told you  He didn't even haggle  Yeah  Taxi drivers  Of course  Yeah, they all stink  They're there  Stinking in their cab  The whole time  Yeah, yeah  Now, did he want to try out the cologne? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, no  He wanted to shake it  To see how heavy it was still  But he was satisfied  Yeah, why not?  I didn't think of cabbies  Very cool  Any other customers around the area?  I get a lot of  Side-long glances  People tend to avoid me on the streets  I hope you get robbed  Yeah, that'd be fun  I'm hoping the NYPD  Cracks his skull or something  Yeah  You know, they want to  Confiscate his shit  Yeah, they want to keep Times Square  You know  Clean from the riffraff  All right, man 
[00:57:00]  Well, there's the update  Dustin has  Made a sale  Wow  Made his first sale  Thank you, Dustin  I didn't see that coming  All right, have a good one  All right  I definitely  Overestimate people  Sambo  Yeah  Whoa, racist  Oh, my God  It's just a nickname  Well, Sam  After the show on Friday  We all got the news  That we lost another wrestler  Yeah  This must have been  What?  Old age?  Heart  Heart failure  Oh, heart failure 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, so it was probably a guy  That was up there in years  Enjoyed wrestling  And then his life afterwards  Raising a family  Probably grandkids  And then, you know  Everyone gathered around  He  Why?  No  He wrestled under the name  Lance Cade  Which, if you've watched  I don't remember  It was probably so long ago  Before I even started  Watching wrestling  He actually  No, the thing is  It was black and white  Yeah, yeah  Black and white wrestling  One of those black and white  That wore the onesie  And went around the ring 
[00:58:00]  And a lot of neck locks  And stuff like that  No?  Wrestling shorts  Pulled up a little too far  Uh-uh  Not one of those  Has the belly button  Nope  Not one of those guys  Think Bruno San Martino  Yeah, yeah  Bruno's dead?  No, Bruno isn't alive  Oh, okay  See, you know what's weird  About wrestling  I have finally figured out  Why?  If you hate Vince McMahon  You get to live  It's old age  That's Bruno and  Bruno hates Vince McMahon  You can't stand him  And he gets to live  Like a long life  Well, yeah  But he's full of hate 
[00:58:30]  And misery  Well, this guy  Why does he hate him?  That keeps the heart disease  Away, obviously  Bruno  This guy must have  Well, yeah  You were saying  That you didn't know  Who he was  He actually started wrestling  After you stopped watching  Wow  Why would an old guy  What year did you stop watching?  Oh, my God  I can't even tell you  Probably, you know  Late 90s  Oh, yeah  He was  Well, I mean  In those years  He hadn't started wrestling yet  Why not?  In the late 90s  Yeah  He was a teenager 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God  Jesus Christ  This wrestling  We lost another young wrestler  Lance K died of heart failure  At the age of 29  Oh, my God  What is with the wrestling, Sam?  I don't  I mean, he wasn't with  The WWE at the time  Of course  They're never with him at the time  At the time of their death  Yeah  He had  I don't get it  Been released from his contract  There's other sports  Where the guys are  Filling around with  You know, the roids and stuff  Why aren't they dying 
[00:59:30]  Like wrestlers are dying?  Well, I guess wrestlers just  There's no off-season  There's no rest period  It's just  They gotta keep  Just fueling to the next day  Yeah  And then once they stop wrestling  Like, once he gets released  It's not like  Oh, well, now that I don't have  That rigorous schedule  They can't  I don't have to take these pills anymore  They don't have the opportunity  To cycle in and cycle out  Like with the roids, supposedly  You gotta  You know, you gotta bail  And give your body a chance  To kinda  Take care of itself  And then you go back in  And do more roids  Any allegations of drug use? 
[01:00:00]  Things like that?  Steroid use?  I mean, I don't think  Any of the allegations  Have officially  Come out  I think  The reason he got released  Was the wellness policy  The wellness policy?  What's the wellness policy?  Well, if they have a  Three strikes, you're out  Wellness policy  Like Umaga  Umaga  Who's the last young wrestler to die  He was released  Because he refused to go to rehab  And then he died  A few months later  Oh, this guy was let go  From the WWE  Earlier this year  After doing a stint in rehab 
[01:00:30]  Right, so what probably happened  Was he did a stint in rehab  He came back  He violated the wellness policy  They let him go  So he was with the WWE  Very  In  I mean  Recent memory  He left in 2008  And then he re-signed in 2009  To the Developmental League  Was this guy  Anybody you remember  As far as, you know  Being a name  Yeah, I mean  He was in a pretty successful tag team  And for a minute  It looked like they were going to  Try to push him  In a singles career  Yeah  But that's, I think  When the wellness stuff  Started  The wellness 
[01:01:00]  Who was his tag team partner?  Trevor Murdoch  Yeah  Good old what?  Trevor Murdoch  And is he alive?  Trevor Murdoch is alive  I did play-by-play  For one of his matches  Recently in New Jersey  In Broadway  Oh my god  So he went from the WWE  To the Rawway Wrestling League  It's a prime time Sam Roberts  Calling the match  The Rawway Rec Center  So  We started the wrestling death clock  How many days did we last this time?  And who was the last wrestler?  Because I already forgot about it  The last wrestler  A lot of people thought it was Canyon 
[01:01:30]  And if that was the case  We would have passed the 90 day mark  But that is incorrect  The last wrestler was Trent Acid  Who was the guy who never made it to the WWE  But still a pro wrestler  So I think  I don't know  I put it on my Twitter  I don't remember  I think it's like  54 days  Something like that  We made 54 days  Without a wrestler dying  You said in like  I think it was the beginning of this year  You said  Let's see if we can go 90 days  Yeah yeah  Since you made that claim  We haven't gone 
[01:02:00]  We haven't gone 90 days  The entire year  Correct  Without a wrestler dying  Yeah yeah  And now 90 days  Near the end of the year  Yeah  We'll be in the middle of November  Yeah  We haven't gone  Wow  We haven't even  Came very close  We haven't gone 80 days  So we gotta reset the wrestling  The wrestler death clock  As of Friday  So so far we've gone  Three to four days  Three days without a wrestler death  Alright  Depending when they found the body  Yeah  Right  Well I say time of death  Not when you find the body 
[01:02:30]  If he died on Thursday  And they didn't find him until Friday  We have Friday without a wrestler death  Alright so we're up to three days  That's good news  Yeah  Heart failure  29 years old  29  Jesus  Yeah it happens  To an athlete  He lived his life  Did he  Let's say hi to E-Rock  E-Rock  Hey  So Dustin made yet another sale  Wow  Jimmy your cologne is hot out there  Hot  He seems to be attracting every cab driver  Of course  Because he's causing gridlock traffic  On both sides of 49th and 6th Avenue 
[01:03:00]  Wow  The cabbies are all lining up to get some cologne  What kind did he sell?  What?  Oh the Gucci  He sold Gucci  Dude for $10?  And it's not garbage  It's like the real stuff  Yeah  Yeah it's not a knockoff  Gucci cologne for fucking $10  Wow  Cabbies are going to be all happy  And they're not just pulling over  They're parking like diagonally  So they're blocking both intersections  And there's delivery trucks now stuck  Trying to make turns  And everything is just backed up right now  Well good  Tell that bitch to make me some more money 
[01:03:30]  Tell him daddy needs a new pair of shoes  So with all the cabbies stopping  You guys should have run out by now  Or what  They're looking and deciding  They don't want it  We don't like your poor salesmanship  Yeah well  He sold one bottle  But the others that he's talking to  They were looking at everything he has  And they said they'll think about it  And come back  So they're just browsing  Alright so we  Fucking Iraq rules  They're browsing  Fucking browsing  So you've sold two so far  Yeah I believe so  Alright  There you go

Oh yes we're filming them  Very good  Alright we'll check in later  Bye my life  We've sold two so far Jimmy  I told you  You're right  I did not occur  I forgot about cabbies  And you can't get in trouble for it  I mean we're not exactly making a  I'm taking a tremendous hit  Of course  It's not like scalping  No  Scalping alone  You could be Lance  Katie  Lance Cade  Cade  Lance Cade  Yeah  Well Lance Cade's dead  Yeah  That was Reuben Kinn 
[01:04:30]  The Hardys versus Lance Cade  And Trevor Murdoch  I mean they  They had a lot of  Pay-per-view matches  They were a big team  They were involved in some  Big freaking matches  Absolutely  Now he's dead at the age of  29 heart failure  Is Al Snow still alive?  Yes he is  And what is he doing?  Al Snow was at  TNA's ECW reunion  Pay-per-view last Sunday  But other than that  He's on the old convention circuit  Not wrestling  Oh no  Why not?  I mean 
[01:05:00]  I like Al Snow  I like him a lot too  He's a friend of the show for a while  I don't think he's in  He's you know  He's reached his 40s  Which is a dangerous  Time for wrestlers  For wrestlers  And so yeah  He's not actively wrestling  He'll jump in for a match  Every now and then  If somebody hires him  To do so  But yeah  He's mainly doing signings  Signings  Conventions  I think he's running a wrestling school  Ah there you go  Shawn Michaels trained Lance Cade  Oh boy  Uh huh  Showed him the ropes huh  Well yeah  He didn't  Unfortunately he didn't have a chance  To get to the level 
[01:05:30]  That Shawn Michaels was at  Which I think was mainly  Because of the  Death at 29  Right  That would  Yeah  Shawn Michaels  Tends to get in the way  Yeah  I mean he had his 30s  And into his 40s  To develop a career  Whereas  Lance Cade  Had much less time  Yes much less time  Alright well there you go  Well you know what they say  We reset the  We reset the  Wrestler death clock  As we move on  Sam  Thank you  Jimmy has found something  Very funny in the paper  Wow  Jimmy what are you looking at

[01:11:30]  The cabbies are listening  They're never going to buy  You're hurting sales  I was watching some other show  About fat  Fat kids  Camp  There's a fat kids camp  Is that the 15 year old one?  Yeah  Yeah  15 and fat  15 and fat  Or 15 and I can't lose the weight  Or 15 and something  There is  A black broad  On this show  That looks like  A fucking alien  She looks like  Like half  Half of her body fat  Went to her head 
[01:12:00]  The back of it  And everything  You know how  Alien  From Aliens  Like has a big back  Of the head  Yeah that extra  Fucking piece  Yeah she looks like that  Does she look like  Precious?

Her little eyes  How bad you wanna pinch  That cheek  Oh dude  She's got high cheekbones  On a fat head  And big like slanted eyes  She looks swollen  And her hair 
[01:14:00]  It looks like her head  Got blown up  With an air compressor  And her hair stayed  The same size  Dude that's disgusting  Parenting really  It's like  You don't get that fat  Unless you start eating  Like that when you're a kid  Well the mama  Was dropping her off  And said that  They're very  Like the first post  In the comments  Is holy mother of god  Yeah the mama  Was dropping her off  And said that  The father  Cashed in his 401k 
[01:14:30]  Because it cost  20 grand  To go to this place  For a few months  To see if she can  Knock off some of the poundage  She can't even walk  And they were making  A big deal  That they  They threw her a basketball  And she threw it  Through the hoop  And everybody was  High-fiving  And just going  Yay yay  And she had to sit down  And lean against the pole  She's black  Of course she could  Throw it through the hoop  Exactly  Yeah I know that  I bet you find a gym  And throw yourself  Through the door 
[01:15:00]  On the treadmill  She is so freakish  Like I wish you could  See a side view  Of her head  Because it's just  The fat coming out  Of the back of her neck  You gotta blame  The parents  Of course  On all these kids  You gotta blame  You gotta blame  The parents  These kids don't know  Any better  If the parents  Are allowing them  To eat like this  Since they were  Baby  His mother was just like  Well he's  And you could just tell  She was just  Shoving food down his throat  I have a  You know we have  Some fat listeners  That get mad at us  When we really go 
[01:15:30]  On our fat people rants  But like  Is there any fat  Fat listeners  That would  Like did you start  Eating when you were  I'm curious  Do they start  When they were a kid  Do your parents  Let you eat  Or do you complain  And they give you  More food  Or do they feed you  To shut you up  I don't know  How that happens  Yeah how does that happen  Where does it  Look at her  Look at her  Look at that face  Oh my god  They try to dolly her up  Too  Is that  Why are they  Trying to look sexy  I don't know  They all want to  Stand next to her  Because they look better  Why do they have  Serious faces on  Because they're fat  Yeah I know 
[01:16:00]  They're only smiling  If there's food in front of them  Maybe they're just  Staring intently  At a T-bone steak  That the camera guy  Is holding up  On a string  They yell go  And one of them  Gets like  Yeah that kid  Does look like  Bobby Hill  Yeah  He absolutely  Is a little  Bobby Hill  Wow  He's a little  Oh my god  Holy shit Danny  Good call  Oh shit  Bobby Hill  That monster though  Is just  And she goes 
[01:16:30]  I hear people  They you know  Point and laugh  And say things  Behind my back  Jesus  Behind your back  Is like behind  The great wall  See cause it's big  See cause it's big  What's better than  A bomb explanation  I love the bomb  Explanation  See because  You see 
[01:17:00]  The reason I said  It is  Yeah  Yeah so that's  Another show  That I was watching  I watch so much  Shit  So what is the  What's the  The point of the show  They're gonna lose weight  By the end of this camp  Yeah yeah  They give them  Little counselors  And they make them  Fucking run  Which they  They run for about  Ten steps  And then they  Either collapse  Or have to start walking  Right  It's very tragic  Alright let's go to  Mike in Virginia  Jimmy asked a question 
[01:17:30]  And they're calling  Mike  Hey  What's going on boys  Hi Mike  What's up Mike  So what happened  When I was like  Eleven  We moved  I grew up in California  And I was like  Just a normal kid  I was you know  Really into sports  And then we moved  To Virginia  And I didn't have  Any friends  And I got like  Really depressed  That like  My whole world  Was upside down  So in order to  Cure my depression  My mom thought  It was okay  To take me to  McDonald's  Every single time  I asked her  Which was like  Four times a week  So I've been like  Sixty pounds  In a year and a half 
[01:18:00]  Wow  I mean I wasn't like  Obese  Like disgusting  Can't walk  But if you look  At pictures from like  Those two different years  I got pretty  I got pretty gross looking  Now I've heard your story  A million times  We need a therapist  Or something  Because why can't you  Cure your depression  By jumping on a bike  Like why does it have to be  I don't get that  It's like it's got to be food  No I'm serious  I'm not even trying to like  Beat you down or anything  Like why is it food  That cures depression  Why can't it be something  That's healthier 
[01:18:30]  I don't know  Do you know the answer Jimmy  I guess it was something  More internal then  Because that's like  All I thought of  Is like you know  I'm a kid  And cheeseburgers taste good  You know I can just sit there  And feel sorry for myself  Like a big fat idiot  Dude no hold on dude  It's almost like  They call it comfort food  For a reason  Like I mean  The cheeseburgers are good man  Fucking M&M's  It's like  You never heard the term  Look that's comfort exercise  Exercise can be fun  But it's not  Dude eating bad food  What's better than 
[01:19:00]  Just sitting there  Eating shitty food  There's nothing more  That feels better than that  Yeah I'm not gonna try to say  Look you could  You know you're depressed  You could eat a lot of celery  I get that part  It's ridiculous  But why not  Healthier stuff  To get you through depression  Well the other part of that too  Is like when you're that young  You don't really fully grasp  Like the decisions you're making  You don't really understand  How shitty for you it is  Like you kind of know  That this isn't good  And maybe I'm getting fat  But you don't really really get  Just how bad it is for you  And like the full consequences  Yeah 
[01:19:30]  Like everything you're eating  And what it's gonna do to you  So you're just  You know you kind of feel  A little bit bad  But you're like  Fuck it  This chocolate shake is delicious  And I don't have any friends  So I'm just gonna watch  Crappy movies  And you know  Eat cheeseburgers  And milkshakes and shit  So  But yeah  That's about the story boys  I'll punch you out  How much do you weigh though?  Right now?  Yeah  Right now I'm 6'2  And I weigh about 230  So you lost a lot of the weight  Yeah I know  I took it mostly off  I mean I'm definitely not like  I don't have like  Six packs abs or anything 
[01:20:00]  But I'm not like  A great big fatso anymore  Because when I got to high school  I realized that  I liked the vagina  And girls don't like fat guys  So  I took care of that  So you got your shit together  Absolutely  Smart  I started running back into sports  And you know  Took care of that  Alright well did you  Your depression just  You just snapped out of your depression  When you started seeing  Fucking nice asses  Well you know  And then you get a little bit older  And your social skills  Develop a little bit  And you're like  Okay I don't have to just be a weirdo  That moved from another state  I can try to make friends  I can try to be active 
[01:20:30]  And you know  Now I'm coming out  Of my awkward stage  Because you know  It is a pretty awkward time  When you're that young  You don't really know  Who you are  And you're not really comfortable  You know  Just being yourself  Or just trying to make friends  So when you get a little bit older  And you know  If your social skills develop  You kind of  Just kind of all fell into place  I guess  But maybe it's not the same  For these you know  Messes on this show  But  Gotcha  Right on Mike  Thank you  Alright take care bud  Nick very upset  Nick in Jersey  Go ahead buddy  Yeah Opie  You're being a very simplistic person 
[01:21:00]  On this one  The reason why  Us fat bastards  Get this way  Is because we're conditioned  Starting at a younger age  To find comfort in food  When I was a kid  I lived in a connected house  Like a duplex  And my next door neighbor  Used to bang on the wall  After I ate breakfast  And said  Oh I've got something for Nicky  Bring Nicky over  Let's feed him  And it was always  I wasn't always a fat kid  I got obese as an adult 
[01:21:30]  Because I was conditioned  To think  Oh you know what  When the shit hits the fan  Turn to food  Your best friend  Nick let me ask  Yeah can I jump in  Because Nick  I just don't  I just don't understand  That's all  I'm trying to  I'm trying to understand  Because in my life  If I go off on desserts  For a while  I actually will get  Like sick  And that stops me  From continuing down the road  Of just you know  Eating way too much  Shitty food  But with other people 
[01:22:00]  They can continue  Past that point  And I don't  I don't understand  That's all  And I'm trying to understand  Let me explain  Something to you  When I'm  When I'm depressed  And I eat  That enjoyment  Lasts for only  The amount of time  It takes to  Stuff the food  Into my fat face  A couple of hours  Later  I'm sick to my stomach  And I'm running  Out of the truck  To use the bathroom  Somewhere  Right  Because I'm making  Myself sick  But you know what  I got my wife 
[01:22:30]  Who's trying to  Keep me together  She's in the truck  With me  And she tries  To keep me  Under control  She doesn't want  Me to eat  But then I'll get  To the point  Where I'll  Sneak food  If I have to  Because I'm  Such  I'm so conditioned  To think food  Is going to make it  Better  Even though  In the long run  It makes it worse  Stop it  Yeah dude  When are you  Going to  Anthony's annoyed  Well because  I hear something  In this guy  Like you know  That eating  Something really  Shitty is only  Going to make  You feel good  Very temporarily 
[01:23:00]  But you continue  Anyway  Exactly  And you know  Well that's addiction  In general  Isn't it Jimmy  Yeah Nick  You keep saying  Your condition  And I understand  That  But it's like  As an adult  You know the difference  So you got to  Make a decision  To do something  Man up  You fat fuck  That was Ant  I know  You have to  Make a decision  Let me tell you  I was a bodybuilder  When I was younger  I used to train people  Now you're a bodybuilding  I'm still building a body 
[01:23:30]  It's just a different  It's different material  I'm using  It's not muscle  It's fat  And shit  And I know  I got a man up  And I've tried  And I continue to try  I never give up  But I keep failing  Because I  For some reason  I can't get out  Of the mindset  But you realize  It doesn't help  Right  You know it doesn't  Like really truly  Help you  It just makes you  Feel worse  Right  Of course  So then when you go  To shove some food 
[01:24:00]  In your mouth  Don't  But at that moment  I'm in such a  Emotional state  That I'm not being  I'm not being rational  Yeah you're describing  You're addicted  Yeah  You have an addiction  Obviously  Absolutely  I mean that's pretty obvious  The definition of addiction  Right there  Yes exactly  And like Jimmy has said  At times  Or other people  Have said at times  The worst part  About being addicted  To food  Is you can't give it up  I don't drink 
[01:24:30]  I don't smoke  I don't do a lot of things  What do you do?  So the people  Didn't get that  Yeah so  Yeah  You can't give up food  And it sucks  It really sucks  Spending 47 years  I'm 47 years old  And the last 18 years  Of my life  Have sucked  Because I haven't been  Under 300  I almost got under 300  About a year and a half ago  And then  I got hit 
[01:25:00]  With so much stress  And so much depression  Over my employment  That I  I just lost it  And now I'm back  Under control again  And I'm working  Towards a goal  Hey do you go to  Any kind of meeting  Nick I'm sorry to interrupt you  Do you go to any kind of  Meetings or anything?  No dude  I really  I really would like to  Why don't you try  A 12 step program  I've never been to it  But there's  You know  Over Eater's Anonymous  From people I know  Who have gone  Is supposed to  Why don't you  Just give it a shot?  Believe me  I'm not 
[01:25:30]  I'm not blowing  Smoke up your ass  I'd really like to  As soon as I make  This lifestyle change  To get out of  Where I'm  Driving over the road  All the time  And living in my truck  With my wife  How about you buy  Even if you can't  Do it physically  Because you're working  How about you buy  Like the  Old Reader's Anonymous  Big book  There probably is one  Yeah you just  You just threw an excuse  At us  I mean how much longer  Are you going to  Keep your current lifestyle?  No we're looking  To get out soon  Oh okay  So it might be  Yeah I'm the fat guy  Who calls you all the time  I'm the fat guy 
[01:26:00]  Who calls you  And at one time  You were making fun  Of fat people  And then all of a sudden  I called you  And told you about my story  And you guys  Got all depressed  And was like  Oh dude  You ruined the show  So I'm the guy  That calls you  All the time about this  And I'm not crying  About my lifestyle  I know I'm the  You're bumming us out man  You're not ruining  Another show man  Exactly  I know he's going to 
[01:26:30]  Go eat something  Really  You depressed him  Right there  Yeah please don't  Go run and eat  A cheeseburger  I hope you hung up on me  Let's go  Go to Troy in Illinois  Jimmy asked this question  And they're coming out  Of the woodwork  Yeah I'm curious  Troy  Hi guys  Hey Troy  What up  Hey  My grandma was at a restaurant  When I was younger  And pretty much all my life  Until about five years ago  And it wasn't really  A depression thing  That got me chubby  It was just more of a 
[01:27:00]  Pleasing  I was trying to  Please her  Like my sister  Would eat  And she wouldn't  Finish her plate  And my grandma  Would come out  And kind of  Yell at her  You want to  Please your grandma  Yeah  So what happened  You'd finish your plate  And she'd be happy with you  And she'd come out  And jerk you off  At the table  Pull her dentures out  And give you a knob job  She'd spit in her old hand  And make him  Make cumzies  All over the front  Of his little pants  No he didn't  I love that  He's got to say  No she didn't  I'm kidding sir 
[01:27:30]  She'd whisper in his ear  I'd ask him my boy  Yeah  I loved one of my grandmas  But I didn't  I didn't want to  I didn't  Want to please her  No  I come from a Mexican family  And you know  They come  They eat a lot  And it just  I've seen what  E-Rock  Yeah of all the segments  I've got to call in  E-Rock selling Jimmy's  Cologne on the streets  Of Manhattan today  What do you got E-Rock  So this black Escalade  Pulls up  And Dustin runs over  And he's showing the guy  What he has

[01:32:30]  My parents used it  As an incentive  You know  You won a baseball game  Or you lost a baseball game  In Little League  Right to the ice cream place  For the McDonald's  I was watching this little kid  Yesterday at Coasey's  In Philly  And the parents were  Feeding him  While he's playing video games  After he won a level  They gave him food  And they said  When he finished his food  They get him an ice cream cone  And the kid was happy  Yeah but  You just described  Pretty much every kid out there  I mean  I have a lot of nephews  And nieces  And they're all eating junk  After baseball games 
[01:33:00]  And shit  But for some people  It becomes a nightmare  For the rest of their lives  I mean  I couldn't play football  When I was in middle school  Because I was over the weight limit  Which is just  Freaking horrific  When you're a little kid  I was 5'2  145 pounds  Jesus  A fat kid  And the reason was  My mom used to give us  A gold star  If you were in the  Queen Play Club  So if you  Hook down your food  And actually finish it all  And it's still  I do it now as an adult  I never stop  The clean plate club  What a shitty club

[01:37:00]  Giraldo killed  But we start off  With a little Jeff Ross  Oh the roast  Comedy Central does them  Right I heard about that  Why aren't you  Because they give me nothing  They've never  They've never historically  Give me anything  What's that about  They just don't like me  Why  Who's the lineup for the roast  They have good comics  They're not using bad acts at all  Uh  Yeah but there's a few guys in there  I'm sure  Don't need to be there  Well  And you should be getting the call  Obviously  What's that about  I've always had a weird relationship  With them  Why  Why  What happened  I honestly don't know  Where did it start  The only thing I can think of 
[01:37:30]  I mean I was on Tough Crowd for two years  Because of Carl  Only because of Colin  And um  I was one of the last guys  Like  They waited a long time  Before they would allow me  To do premium blend  It was like  I was never one to consider  One of their guys  That they wanted to use  Why though  You don't know  Don't know  Or care  As time went on  Did you wrote someone the wrong way  Something's up  Maybe  Don't know  I honestly don't know  But as time went on  And then they offered me  A special  A half hour special  It was around that time  I was talking  We're beginning to look at HBO 
[01:38:00]  And I was like  No I turned them down  I didn't do it  Ah  So they're fucking holding a grudge  I don't care  You take HBO over Comedy Central  Every time though  I turned them down  For specials  Yeah  But that was only because  I never felt like  The network liked me  Right  I don't want to be  One of your 500 guys  They're throwing it at me  Because again  You have to fill time  So I'm one of the guys  You're throwing it at  Just one of the guys  That didn't feel right  You want to feel a little special right  You want to feel like  They want to use you  Yeah  Sam  No I didn't know  We're just going to play  A Jeff Ross clip  Going into break  And then I heard  Geraldo killed 
[01:38:30]  So we got to get  Some of that on today  I was just going to set up  The context  That I don't know  For Ross  Yeah  I don't know if it will  Come up in his jokes  It definitely doesn't  Geraldo's  But Ross came out  You know the picture  Of David Hasselhoff  That's all  Of him  No with the leather jacket  And the speedo  And he's just there  With his hands on his hips  Oh and it keeps coming  Like at you  Right like that one  The never ending loop  Of David Hasselhoff  Coming at you  That's what  Jeff Ross was wearing  Ah  When he wore this  He wore this 
[01:39:00]  As he roasted him  With the leather jacket  And the speedo  God bless Jeff  Jeff is a funny guy  Jesus  Yeah  That's funny  Alright well  Did he give it away  When he first walked out  Or how did they know  That he was going to wear that  He went  Instead of coming  Right from the DS  He went backstage  Right before he went on  Okay  Yeah and then they introduced him  And he came out  And he was like  Kind of dancing a little bit  And he danced  In front of Hasselhoff  Or DS  The DS  The DS  What's his spell  How's his spell  The DS brothers  D-A-I-S  I believe  Where's it D-I-A-S 
[01:39:30]  It's D-I-S  I don't know how to pronounce though  DS  Yeah  Isn't it D-A-I-S  D-A-I-S  Isn't it a weird spelling  DS  A before I  Except after what  Except when Y  I before E  Except that  No it's I before E  That's it  Yeah  That's pretty funny man  That's the  Endless loop  Because the little Hoff  Looks like a cat  Coming right at you  Yeah  Yeah  That's pretty funny  So Ross wore that outfit  Yeah  As he roasted  David Hasselhoff 
[01:40:00]  Last night  Well we must pay  Gratitude to tonight's  Great Roastmaster  Seth  Great job tonight man  Great job  Seriously  A man of a thousand voices  All of them Stewie  Oh Seth  By the way  South Park called  They want their  Everything back  Anyway folks 
[01:40:30]  As you know  I only roast  The ones I love  And David Hasselhoff  Finally a Jew  Gets to roast a German  Heil Hasselhoff  The only difference  Between Hasselhoff  And Hitler  At least Hitler  Knew when his career  Was over  Why do the Germans  Love you so much  Huh  Maybe it's because  That you fill  The entertainment void  Left by Anne Frank  Uh too soon 
[01:41:00]  I must admit  I really did love you  In that cheeseburger  Commercial you made  Seriously  How's that chain  Of all you can eat  Off the floor restaurants  Coming along  You know  It's kind of ironic  You make millions  Playing a lifeguard  Because every night  You drown in your own sorrows  The Hoff once 
[01:41:30]  Blew into a breathalyzer  And the breathalyzer  Said whoa whoa  One at a time people  Where's my Knight Rider fans  I know you're out there  What a lucky break  What are the odds  An alcoholic gets cast  To the show  About a car  That drives itself  Sirius XM  It's a virus  Yeah 
[01:42:00]  This is the  Opinion of the show  I don't wanna take  What you can't do  I'll have a stop  And eat your bread  I'll ever run  But I can't walk  Guess I'll lie alone  Just like before  Bang  A little pearl jam  For everyone  I wish I had watched them  When I was in Bonnaroo  You should have 
[01:42:30]  Oh yeah  That would have been good  Bonnaroo  Well  Here we go  Obama  Obama  He's swimming in the gulf though  Big deal  He's like  Politically  He's like  What's his name  In Jaws  Showing everybody  That it's okay  To go in the water  Why don't you go in the water  What is he vacationing down there  Saying look  Come on  Come back to the gulf  Everything's okay  Look at me  Look at me and my family  Swimming a little bit  Everybody  Gave him shit 
[01:43:00]  Because he was vacationing  You know  Saying that people  Should go down there  And then he goes up to Maine  And then he goes to Maine  Well he went to his favorite spot  So now he figures that  Yeah I'll go down there  To the gulf  And we'll swim around  In the gulf of Mexico  And uh  Then he  He  He had a little faux pas there  He should have kept his mouth shut  You don't think  In this political climate  I was just thinking though  About the swim  You don't think like  Okay  You're thinking pelicans too  No no 
[01:43:30]  They're okay  They don't need to be  Rushed off  To be scrubbed  They're fine  Let them swim  Just going for the obvious  Everything's good  Fucking idiot I am  Anyway go ahead  Uh  Yeah Obama  Chimed in about this  Fucking mosque  Yes he did  By ground zero  And  Do people  Tell him  Beforehand  Look  Shut up about this  Because  Uh  The election's coming up  In November  And this is a  No win for you 
[01:44:00]  I like  No but I think  It was a win for him  If he had said  No  If he had come out  And said  Legally  They have the right  To do it  We all know that  But I think  That the important thing  Should be sensitivity  Towards 9-11 victims  Yeah he missed  I know  He missed that point  He stated the obvious  I don't think people  Are arguing  You know  Freedom of religion  In America  But  Yeah  A lot of people  Are up in arms  Because of  The insensitivity  Of the whole thing  No one's arguing  The point  That in America  You have the right  To purchase property 
[01:44:30]  And build what you want  On it  As long as it's legal  And practice  Whatever religion you want  Wherever it is  I mean  We all understand that  Just a lot of people  Think  The legality of it  This idiot  The idiots  That are building  The mosque  Should say  Look  We  You know  We realize  This is kind of  A bad place for it  We're going to move  Somewhere else  They might now  To be honest with you  Especially since  The leader of Hamas  Has come out  And said he thought  It was a great idea 
[01:45:00]  That's wonderful  That's what you want  But I'm glad  That the Post  Reported it  Good  As opposed to  The fucking  Daily News  Front page  Bedbug City  That's good  Hey man  800,000 people  Might have bedbugs  In New York City  That's a big story  It is  But it's not as big  As Hamas  Backing the same thing  As fucking  That they're trying  To build a ground zero  Right  Well here's Obama's  Original statement  And then he had to  Do some backtracking  When I guess  His advisors  Got to him  And said  Dude  That's pretty much  Not the point here  And then they say  I love how they say  He wasn't backtracking  Like they have to say  Oh no 
[01:45:30]  He absolutely was backtracking  I'm speaking to what he said  But this is a little  Clarification  But here's his  Original statement  Ground zero  Is indeed  Hallowed ground  But let me be clear  Clear  As it  Engenders  Let me be clear  And ground zero  Is indeed  Hallowed ground  But let me be clear  As a citizen  And as president  I believe that Muslims  Have the right  To practice their religion  As everyone else 
[01:46:00]  In this country  And that includes  Flying planes into buildings  That includes the right  To build  A place of worship  And a community center  On private property  In lower Manhattan  Many people aren't arguing  That part  No one's arguing that  Part of this  No one's arguing that  It's private property  The scumbags  Who are leasing the property  To them  Are the ones that people  Should be fucking  Focusing their rage at  Right  But no one is arguing  For the most part  What he's said so far  Yeah  It's like  Of course it's illegal  In accordance with local laws 
[01:46:30]  And ordinances  This is America  And our commitment  To religious freedom  Must be unshakable  Oh really?  The principle that people  Of all faiths  Are welcome in this country  Yeah  And that they will not  Be treated differently  By their government  Is essential  To who we are  The writ of the founders  He's right  He's totally right about that  But how about one thing  About how it's in poor taste  Or how about 
[01:47:00]  Sometimes you have to weigh  It's a very sensitive  And how about  One fucking thing like that  Yeah  He had nothing to say  About how it's insensitive  For a lot of people  That's all  Yeah  Shitty  People really want to hear  What he has to say about that  And he avoided that  In that state  Of course he did  Yeah  At least  Everything he said  Was absolutely right  Yeah of course  We know that  No one is saying  Muslims shouldn't be  Allowed to practice  Yeah but living in  New York City  A lot of people  Most of the population  Have a big fucking  Problem with this  They do practice  It's called flight school  Yeah 
[01:47:30]  Fuckers  And a lot of America  Has a problem with this  I think it's a majority  Right on this issue  Obviously in Manhattan it is  Yeah  64% I think  Although our stupid mayor  In New York City  Doesn't get it either  He's a fucking bag of shit  Bloomberg  He's a fucking bag of shit  He doesn't understand  How this is insensitive  To a lot of people  I'd love to have seen  The argument on this  And how short it would have been  Years ago  With Rudy?  Yeah  Like right after 9-11 
[01:48:00]  If  Oh yeah  By the way  This is gonna  There's gonna be a mosque  Built here  To be like  No it's not  But Anthony  There would have been  Fucking riots  Time heals all wounds  We know that now  No time makes people  Fucking idiots  That forget  Time heals all wounds  Yes  A great man said that  Time wounds all heals  Oh shit  That's what I say  So then  They got to Obama  Somewhere else  And then he  Added to his 
[01:48:30]  His statement  Yes  What do you think  About the reaction  To your speech  About the mosque  What about the reaction  To your speech  Well  The  You know  My intention  Was to  Simply let people  Know  What I thought  Which was  That  In this country  We treat  We treat  Everybody  Equally  In accordance  With the law  Regardless of race  Regardless of religion  I was not  Commenting  And I will not  Comment on the  Wisdom  Of making a decision 
[01:49:00]  To put a mosque  There  I was commenting  Very specifically  On the right  The people have  That dates back  To our founding  That's what  Our country is about  And  I think it's  Very important  That  As difficult  As some of  These issues are  We stay focused  On  Who we are  As a people  And what  Our values  Are all about  You know  I don't think  He brings up  The founding fathers  And what they thought  I don't think  The first thing  They were thinking  Was to 
[01:49:30]  After  Winning the  Revolutionary war  Was to build  A British  Community center  On the grounds  Of  Some of the  Biggest battles  Where most of  The patriots  Were killed  I really don't  Think  They wanted  A tribute  Or  Anything  Having to do  With the  Brits  It makes no  Sense  Yeah you didn't  See the church  Of England  Going up at  Waterloo  Yeah  Exactly  This is what  It is  That's a  Fucking war zone 
[01:50:00]  It's a battlefield  Down there  That's what  Happened  It was a  Battlefield  And it's like  Building a  Fucking  Can you imagine  Two blocks  From Auschwitz  Building  And again  It's a much  Building a  Tribute  To Nazi  Soldiers  Who were killed  In the war  You would never  See something  Like that  And it is  At much  Grander scale  But it's  The same  It's the  Same  Idea  Volkswagen  Factory  It's the  Same idea  You can't  It's  It's not  About  Not being 
[01:50:30]  Fucking  Scumbags  Rubbing it  In every  Face  But  And us  Having to  Be the  Tolerant  Ones  Fuck  You  Intolerance  Sick of  Being  Tolerant  Loamy  But at  This point  It's obvious  This thing  Is going to  Be built  Down there  They might  Move it  There's no  Fucking way  This thing  Is going to  Be built  Down there  Yeah  No way  I don't  Think so  It'd be too  Much negativity  Around it  If they do  You know  What do you  Think  You think  They build it  Down there  I don't  Know 
[01:51:00]  I think  They'll be  Given incentive  To do it  Somewhere else  And they'll  Do it  Somewhere else  If Muslims  Have any  Common sense  If you  Were to  Do that  As an  Act of  Goodwill  Like we  Know we  Have the  Right to  We were  Approved  To build  It  But while  9-11  Was not a  Statement  Of our  Religion  We understand  How people  Feel  And we  Want you  To know  That we're  Not unreasonable  We are  Sensitive to  People  That would  Go such a  Long way  Into people  Going  Wow man  You know  What  Muslims  Are not  These  Unreasonable  Kooks  That we  See in  The media  How about  For once 
[01:51:30]  You guys  Step up  Yeah  You've been  Here  You're  Allowed  To do  Whatever  The fuck  You want  No one  Bans  Mosques  Nobody  Says Muslims  Can you  Imagine pulling  This shit  In a province  Somewhere  Try this  In Kandahar  Or try this  In Karachi  Well there  May be  The occasional  Synagogue  There  Come on  Yeah  Somebody  Is asking  A question  To you  Jimmy  Yes  Go ahead  Hey  Jimmy 
[01:52:00]  I was just  Wondering  If you could  Clarify the  Comment  As far as  Church of  England  Being built  At Waterloo  That was  Probably not  Good  What happened  At Waterloo  I was just  Trying to  Think of  A historical  France got  Their asses  Kicked  I think  That was  Napoleon  But yes  He would  Have been  Against it  I think  Okay  Let me  Correct  Myself  I was  Going to  Say the  Alamo  And I  Wasn't  Sure  What  Happened  There  Sounded  Really  Good  Yeah  Thank  You  Man  Good  I thought  It  Brought  It  All  Together  I'm  An  Ass  It  Kind of  Works  Though  Because 
[01:52:30]  Napoleon  Got his  Ass handed  To him  At Waterloo  I should  Have picked  A place  Where  Oh  They  Where  They won  In the  US  Where  Where  Is  Waterloo  Waterloo  Is in  Russia  Right  It's  Not  US  I'm a  Dope  Waterloo  Is in  Russia  No  No  I  No  I  Fucked  Up  I  Meant  It  Is  Here  No  It's  It's  In  Europe  Yeah  It's  It's  Definitely  Over  There  I  I  Meant  It

[02:02:30]  Which  Doesn't  Allow  For  Additions  To  The  Deficit  Beyond  Ten  Years  Is  That  True  Or  Not  Why  Why  Can't  Obama  True  Or  Not  That  The  Reconciliation  You  Dummy  The  Tax  Cuts  Were  Passed  Under  Reconciliation  Because  They  Couldn't  Get  60  Votes  Which  Is  Why  They  Have  To  Expire  Tax  And  Spend  Democrats  Doing  It  Again  That's  What  It  Boils  Down  To  No  You  Didn't  Answer  My  Question 
[02:03:00]  You  Didn't  Answer  My  Fucking  Question  That  If  I  Employ  People  And  I  Tax  I  Not  Going  To  Employ  People  Of  Course  Not  So  That  Helps  This  Country  How  At  Almost  10  At  Almost  10  Unemployment  How  Does  That  Help  It's  Actually  More  Like  17  Unemployment  But  That  They  Don't  They  Don't  Count  The  Numbers  Right  Whatever  I'm  So  Fucking  Tired  I'm  Tired  Of  This  Shit  But  Your  Solution 
[02:03:30]  Isn't  A  Solution  They  Have  No  Record  Of  Success  My  Solution  Is  Getting  Pelosi  And  The  Democrats  In  The  Fucking  Democrats  Are  So  Bad  Yeah  How  Did  They  Get  A  60  Seat  Majority  59  With  Ted  Kennedy  Dead  Because  Record  Gains  In  The  House  They're  Plummeting  In  The  Fucking  Polls  Obama's  Plummeting  The  Democrats  Are  Plummeting  They're  Going to  Lose  Seats  Watch  Them  Lose  Seats  When  They  Get  Wiped  Out  In  November  I'll  Fucking  Be  Happy  With  That  It  Doesn't  Bother  Me  But  All 
[02:04:00]  I'm  Saying  Is  From  06  And 08  They  Made  Record  Gains  How  Did  A  Black  Man  With  A  Muslim  Name  Get  Elected  To  The  White  House  If  The  Democrats  Are  So  Because  George  Bush  Fucked  Up  So  Badly  There  Was  A  Horrible  Republican  Ticket  And  Black  People  Came  Out  In  Droves  Along  With  Young  Liberal  Whites  And  Voted  In  The  First  Black  President  To  Be  A  Part  Of  History  Believe  Me  That  Had  A lot  More  To 
[02:04:30]  Sarah Palin  In  My  Fucking  Mouth  She  Did  Actually  I  Never  Ever  Wanted  That  Fucking  Sarah  Sarah Palin  Actually  To answer  Your  Question  About  Why  They  Voted  For  Obama  I  Think  Sarah  Palin  Cost  McCain  The  Election  Of  Of  You  Guys  Talk  To  People  Like  Hannity  Thinks  Sarah  Palin  Can  Be  President  The  United  States  Hold on  One  Thing  At  A  Time  Dude  So  Hannity  Hannity  And  I  First  Of  Not  The  Same 
[02:05:00]  Is  Much  More  Conservative  Than  I  Am  And  Because  Hannity  Thinks  Sarah Palin  Would  Make  A  Good  President  Means  Nothing  To  Me  Because  I  Don't  Think  She'd  Be  A  Good  President  And  I  Think  She'd  Cost  Him  The  Election  Of  Course  Not  So  Don't  Put  That  On  Me  Because  He  Thinks  That  Way  That's  Up to  Sean  You  Guys  I  Said  People  Who  Think  Republicans  Are  The  Solution  But  That's  Not  True  Believe  Sarah Palin  Could  Be  President  A  Lot  Of  People  Feel  That  Democrats  Just  Aren't  Like  Dude  Ant  Is  Talking  About  What  He  Sees  In  His  Own  Life  He's  Going  To  Be  Paying  More  Now  Than  He  Did  Have  To  Expire 
[02:05:30]  That's  What  I  Don't  Know  I  Don't  Know  The  Legality  Of  Why  The  Tax  Cuts  But  I  Know  One  Thing  Obama  Is  The  President  And  He  Could  Probably  Not  That  Wouldn't  Expire  Why  Do  They  Have  To  Expire  Because  They  Didn't  Do  It  Through  The  Normal  Process  They  Used  Reconciliation  Twice  That's  The  History  Of  Those  Tax  Cuts  That's  Truth  Look  It  Up  So 
[02:06:00]  Why  Can't  Obama  Just  Extend  That  Well  He  Doesn't  Want  To  He  Oh  He  Doesn't  Want  To  Why  Why  He  Told  You  Why  Why  Would  Anyone  Think  He  Would  All  Of  A  Extend  Tax  Because  When  He  Ran  On  This  Platform  Yeah  Well  Why  Why  Wouldn't  He  It's  Better  For  Business  And  It's  Better  For  The  The  Country  If  You  Cut  The  Taxes  Or  Leave  The  Tax  Cuts  In  Place  For  Small  Businesses  And  Big  Businesses  They  Hire  The  People  They  Hire  People  Who  Should  Pay  The  Trillion  Dollars  To  The  Iraq 
[02:06:30]  War  The  Tax  Payers  Of  Course  All  Of  The  Tax  Everyone  That  Of  Income  Bears  In  This  Fucking  Country  I'm  Tired  Of  I'm  Tired  Of  Being  A  Beast  Of  Burden  I'm  Tired  Of  Being  A  Beast  Of  Burden  For  Fucking  Freeloaders  So  Suck  My  Dick  But  Why  Don't  You  Tell  Yourself  That  Those  Tax  Cuts  The  Tax  Money  You're  Paying  Spends  Just  On  Military  Wouldn't  That 
[02:07:00]  Freeloading  Cunts  I'd  Rather  Spend  Something  I'd  Rather  Pay  My  Entire  Year's  Taxes  On  One  Rivet  For  A  Predator  Drone  Than  Fucking  Than  Pay  For  Freeloaders  Well  You  Think  Soldiers  Should  Get  Healthcare  For  Life  Do  I  Think  Soldiers  Should  Get  Healthcare  For  Life  Let  Me  Think  I  Think  Veterans 
[02:07:30]  Of  War  Should  Probably  Get  Healthcare  Yeah  Yeah  So  If  You  Achieve  A  Certain  Status  And  I  Agree  I  Said  Soldiers  That  Have  Gone  To  War  Not  People  Of  Certain  Status  What  About  People  Who  Are  Like  Mentally  Retarded  Shut  Up  Really  Literally  Fuck  Them  They're  Easy  That's  True  Just  Tell  That  There's  Candy  In  The  Pillow  You  Apply  It  Based  On  A  Status  Which  I  Agree 
[02:08:00]  With  But  Oh  Here  He  Is  A  Status  Old  Poor  People  Should  Get  Social  Security  Because  They're  Old  And  Poor  But  They  The  Army  Thing  Which  I  Agree  With  They  Should  Get  It  I  Have  Family  Members  They're  In  The  Military  But  That's  A  Status  Argument  That  Because  Of  Their  Service  You  Love  Making  It 
[02:08:30]  That  You  Have  A  Principle  On  Subject  Or  You  Don't  You  Don't  Have  To  Turn  Into  If  Someone  Hold  If  Someone  Is  This  By  The  Way  Is  The  Way  Democrats  Think  One  Thing  One  Thing  Has  To  Be  Everything  If  You  If  You  Agree  With  This  One  Little  Niche  Thing  Then  You  Agree  With  The  Entire  Party  Line  Can  I  Ask  You  A  Question  Bro  And  I  I'm  Curious  About  This  If  Ant 
[02:09:00]  Said  Whether  Like  I  Think  That  Veterans  Of  Foreign  Wars  Should  Be  Given  Health  Care  For  Life  How  Does  That  Turn  Into  Anything  But  Veterans  Of  Foreign  Wars  It  Doesn't  To me  All I'm  Saying  Is  Because  Of  That  Status  You're  Saying  Because  Of  What  They've  Done  For  The  Country  You  Think  Yes  They  Dirty  And  Medicaid  For  Poor  People  If  They're  Saying  Their  Status  I'm  Not  Saying  I  Think  And  When 
[02:09:30]  Other  People  Say  Well  Old  To  Get  Social  Security  That's  Because  Of  Their  Status  You  Just  Don't  Agree  With  That  Status  Getting  The  Health  Care  I  Still  Don't  Understand  What  You  Mean  Because  Other  Status  You're  Talking  About  Status  Because  You're  Using  The  Same  Word  It  Doesn't  Put  Them  Into  An  Equal  Category  Right  So  You  Think  Soldiers  Have  Earned  The  Right  To  Lifetime  Health  Care  Because  Of  United  States 
[02:10:00]  Deserve  Getting  Social  Security  When  They  Retire  Because  Of  What  They  Done  For  The  Contra  And  I  Agree  With  That  Too  The  Argument  They  Make  That's  The  Same  Argument  So  When  Anthony  Says  Fuck  Social  Programs  The  Idea  Behind  Social  Programs  Is  People  Came  Up  With  The  Idea  That  Certain  People  Deserve  Freeloaders  Motherfucker  Didn't  I  Say  For  Freeloaders  I  Said  Social  Programs  That  Take  Money  Out  Seems  To  Be  A 
[02:10:30]  Bit  Too  Many  And  I  Don't  Like  The  Way  Obama  And  Pelosi  And  All  These  Other  Motherfuckers  Are  Using  My  Money  To  Pay  For  These  People  To  Help  Bring  Them  Up  As  They  Said  I  Don't  I  Don't  Care  About  Them  I  Don't  Give  A  Flying  Fuck  About  Them  I  Don't  Want  My  Money  Being  Used  To  Take  Care  Of  Other  People  Like  That  But  Now  You  Why  People  Say  They  Don't  Give  A  Fuck  About  Rich  People  Because  They  Do  The  Same  Thing  Why  Do  I  Give  Oh  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  We  Only  Pay  99%  Of  The  Fucking 
[02:11:00]  Taxes  We  Foot  We  Foot  Like  96%  Of  The  Bill  96%  Of  The  Fucking  Bill  Is  Footed  By  People  That  Are  Considered  The  Evil  Wealthy  People  I'm  Not  Disagreeing  With  You  What  I'm  Saying  Is  When  People  Say  Look  At  Rich  People  How  Good  They  Have  Look  How  Much  Money  They  Have  And  They  Say  Fuck  Rich  People  They  Should  Pay  More  Taxes  That's  The  Same  Logic  He's  Saying  Fuck  These  Freeloaders  They  Don't  Do  Shit  How  About  How  About  We  Get  A  President  In  There  And  A  House  That  Says  That  They  Have  To  Pay  Taxes  That 
[02:11:30]  There's  No  More  Tax  Exemptions  If  You  Make  Ten  Thousand  Dollars  A  Year  You  Have  To  Pay  Fucking  Five  Hundred  Dollars  At  The  End  Of  The  Year  How  About  That  I  Just  Realize  I  Live  In  The  State  That  We  Don't  Have  Sales  Or  Income  Tax  And  Any  Democrat  That  ever  Mentions  The  Income  Tax  Gets  Killed  We  Don't  Have  Sales  In  New  Hampshire  Because  If  You  Try  To  Get  That  Past  Here  You  Get  Destroyed  You  You're  Out  Of  Office  Good  For  You  It's  So  Weird  With  The  Democrats  Too  Man  It's  Like  I'm  Honestly  Up  In  The  I  Agree  The  I 
[02:12:00]  Would  Prefer  Republicans  Are  Better  For  My  Taxes  But  The  Democrats  Like  With  The  Case  Against  Stagliano  Being  Thrown  Out  And  With  Them  Not  Pursuing  Porn  Or  Decency  That's  Where  The  Republicans  Lose  Me  And  It's  So  It's  Hard  Because  Like  For  For  Us  Because  The  Republicans  Even  Though  They're  Not  Politically  Correct  Well  Because  They're  Always  Tied  Into  That  Religious  Right  Bullshit

[02:31:00]  And you're an asshole  You want it to be more impressive than a mishap  You never want to die because of a mishap  You're so right  Man dies in testicle smelling mishap  Steven Slater is a dick  Yeah he is  God I've turned on this fucking guy  Everyone's turned on him  All he needed was a little time in front of the TV cameras  And you realize  Well this guy's just a jerk  He's the jerk off flight attendant  That you hate  Yeah  He's a chode  Chode  I've heard that one in a while 
[02:31:30]  He's a jerk chode  You chode  Oh but Janine Pirro's gonna give her opinion on it  Shut up  He's just a jerk  His story's falling apart too right  I guess he initially said that that cut on his head  Was because of the luggage  Or the altercation he got into  With the woman  Before he pulled the chute  And fucking jumped out  And now it seems  That isn't the case  And he's not saying where he got that wound 
[02:32:00]  Yeah no one's backing up his claim anymore  Eat pray love  Or eat love pray  What do you do first  You eat first  Then you do a little praying  And then you do a little fucking  I don't know  That looks  Sorry  Horrible  No it looks good  It's a chick  It's a chick thing  You know  We're not supposed to  We're not supposed to understand that one  I don't think  No  You're not fighting Denny  No I got it now  What happened was  I did a goof review on Red Eye  Last Monday  So can we hear the goof review 
[02:32:30]  Before you do part two of this Jimmy  Yes  Okay  I wouldn't object  By the way  Here's the setup  You're setting it up by saying  You purposely were doing a goof review  Of Eat pray love  Greg had said to me  Gutfeld emailed me  He goes look  I would love you to be  My eat pray love correspondent  Of course  Because I'm so wrong for it  And it was before the movie had come out  I had obviously not seen the movie  So it was a goof segment  That I was going to review the film  And that's where the comedy comes in  Well let's hope guys  The comedy  Alright here's Jimmy 
[02:33:00]  Goof reviewing  Eat pray love  Everyone knew that  On Red Eye Last Monday  On Red Eye Last Monday  Oh  Hold on a minute  That was nice huh  It's sensuous  Succulent and life affirming  And it opens this Friday  I speak of that movie  Eat pray love  It's a liberating tale  Of a woman's year long trip  To three far flung countries  Of the world  The character played by Julia Roberts  Finds herself embarking  On a search for pleasure  Spiritual enlightenment  As a way to find balance  In her life  It's not just a travelogue really 
[02:33:30]  It's an empowering story  Of self fulfillment  With me now is Jim Norton  Our eat pray love correspondent  Jim uh  By the way thank you for becoming  Our eat pray love correspondent  Thank you for asking me Greg  Well you know what  You were the first person  I thought of  Because I think  I should have been  Yeah you've been preparing  For weeks for this movie  Haven't you  I really have been  I've been meditating  On the toilet  And punching my own testicles  Yeah really  Interesting  Now then the movie begins  She's a wreck  The Julia Roberts character's wreck  She's bankrupt  Her wedding's over  And she just says  You know what 
[02:34:00]  I'm going to get up  And I'm going to leave  What kind of message  Does this send to American women  It's important Greg  Because it says that  No matter how lousy a wife you are  Or how bad an employee  How horrible you are with money  Is always time for a vacation  Yes  Exactly  Just get up  Go to Karachi  Yeah exactly  Well you know she goes  She goes to Italy  And you know what she does  She enjoys the  She savors the simple Italian foods  On her first day  She eats a lot of gelato  She really does  And then there's that  Wonderful scene at the end  Where she's vomiting gelato  And Jägermeister into a gutter 
[02:34:30]  Yeah  It's interesting you know  A lot of movies  Wouldn't show that  No but they do  And then Eric Roberts  Comes over and overacts again  It's really a nice moment  It's unusual  Because they're related  Yet they share a love scene  Yes  Which makes no sense  Yeah and yet he stayed here  And she went way up there  Really comforting for both of them  Now she takes a language course  She does  Yes  Through a series of wacky mishaps  She has to say  It's an emergency  Where's the toilet  With 40 different languages  Really  Why that's so beautiful though  She does find the toilet 
[02:35:00]  Half the time she does  Half the time she has to improvise  Hats  Fields  Whatever she can  Steins  Oh that Julia  She's charming no matter what she does  A hole in the ice in Alaska  Incredible  Oh god  She discovers yoga  She goes to meditate  And she approaches spirituality  With skepticism  And then she's won over  Isn't she  She does  I was the first one  To start clapping  What she really did  Because I didn't know  If she was going to overcome  Yeah  You had no idea did you  Oh it was heartbreaking 
[02:35:30]  These yoga scenes  And I'm sipping my chamomile tea  And I'm lactating  And I'm thinking about my vagina  And motherhood  Yeah  And then she finally realized  What she was supposed to realize  Yeah  I don't want to blow it for everybody  But really it was  What happens at the end of the movie  I mean I don't want to spoil it for everybody  But does she finally find her true love  She really does  She goes to India  And she begins traipsing barefoot  Through the slums  And falls in love with the smell of garbage  And a man with one foot  Oh  Wow  See it doesn't matter  If you are missing a foot  Is that the message  That is the message  Because she holds up his good one 
[02:36:00]  And she goes  This is going to go too  And then she kisses it  And the film ends  She's marvelous  Did you smell Oscar?  Oh Greg  This is the finest film  I've ever been forced to sit through  At gunpoint  It really was wonderful  Alright  Well you know what  We're going to close things out  With a post game rapper  From TV's Andy Levy  And that was obviously  Fucking hilarious  Thank you  Obviously a ludicrous review  Of a film I had not seen  Of course  And someone took it seriously  On their blog  Well before  She's a  Why would you take that seriously? 
[02:36:30]  What happened to feminism?  Like I guess they were always a little  Take themselves too seriously  But  I would love to get her on the phone  Her name is  What's her name?  Danny  The one who wrote that  Not even to yell at her  But I really don't want to  Sarah  I can't  Sarah Arboleda  Sarah Arboleda  I would love to just talk to her  And go like  How do you not understand that  The comedy  Whether you thought it was funny or not  That's a subjective thing  But it was in the ludicrousness  Of the review  Yeah it was obvious  A comedy thing 
[02:37:00]  It's like  In The Jerk  When he goes  Damn these glasses son  And Steve Martin points at them  And goes  Okay  I damn thee  Yeah  That's a ludicrous  Thing to happen  It's not ever going to happen  Yes  So maybe Steve  If he's listening  Can we look for her?  Yes  So what did she write there Jimmy?  I don't have it  I have her on the phone  From Australia  She wrote  Oh it's long  I don't want to read the whole thing  Where's the part  Can I have it printed out? 
[02:37:30]  I'll say  I have no desire to read  Eat Pray Love  When it was a book  And I have even less desire  To see it now  That it's been made into a film  So she has not read it or seen it  Okay  I was content to argue  That my lack of interest  Was because  For whatever reason  The film just doesn't appeal to me  But after hearing  Comedian Jim Norton's  Sexist review of the movie  I'm beginning to worry  That it has something to do  With the stigma  Attached to lady films  Especially lady films  In which the lady in question  Is trying to find herself  Not just get a man 
[02:38:00]  And then she goes into  Her favorite film of all time  Is Stand By Me  I would really like to edit this  And then at the bottom  She bashes  Fuck  I don't want to just paraphrase  Because I don't want to  Rob what she said  Let me  Give me  I'll have to read it  I can't  We'll have to go back to this  I guess  My favorite movie of all time  Is Stand By Me  And while I vehemently argue  That it's because  The film so perfectly  Encapulates the moment  Of childhood  Right before gender  Really starts to matter  I also admit  That I hated  Explicitly female  Counterpart 
[02:38:30]  Now and then  With a passion  We already know  That female comedians  Are absent from the big screen  But what about  Traumatic actresses  Is that female  Protagonists  Are less interesting  Or just less interesting  Films are typically  Made about them  I know that this is  Hardly a groundbreaking argument  But Norton's comments  Infuriated me  Oh  If for no other reason  Than because  He seems to suggest  That a woman's  Spiritual journey  Of self-discovery  Is frivolous  Irresponsible  And worst of all  Boring  It is boring  It is boring  Shut it  But what annoys me 
[02:39:00]  Coming from where we sit  But this is again  Her  I don't have the agenda  This chick does  You weren't fucking around  A movie about self-discovery  Regardless of gender  Is boring  Right  To me  And for her to assume  That it's because  It made her angry  As a woman  Wow that's real  Female empowerment  Have a great sense of humor  Then she goes  First there's Norton's  Completely unoriginal  Misogyny  About the unimportance  Of a woman's  Self-discovery  And it was like  You dummy  To think that that was  About a woman's 
[02:39:30]  Self-discovery  Being unimportant  When I'm making fun  Of the film I haven't seen  Yeah  And then she goes  Into the  The chamomile tea  And the lactating line  Yawn  We get it  Women's films are boring  Oops  It was more  I'm sorry  Okay yawn  We get it  Women's films are boring  And they're all about  Emotions and junk  Where were the guns  Where were the nameless  Hot chicks  And it's like  At my house  If you only knew  The kind of films  I  Almost every film I love 
[02:40:00]  Does not have nudity in it  You dummy  It's like  She's  Annoyed  About a movie  Review  Of a film  A book she has not read  A film she has not seen  About a comedian  That she obviously  Knows very little about  And she's not doing it  In humor  She's seriously angry  It's like  What the fuck  That's fucked up  And it goes on  And I don't want to  Paraphrase it  On and on  But it's just like  That's what you deal with  What happened to fucking  Feminists just annoy me  I've never met a funny  Feminist  But this is what they are 
[02:40:30]  It's like this  Self-righteous  Like I did  It's  Hey Bob  Women's self-discovery  Is not to be  Ridiculed  I'm just getting a kick  Out of reading your quotes  I just heard it  Like  I just heard it  On the clip we played  But to read your quotes  And then her reacting to it  Is  Simply insanity  And then she  But then she misquoted me  And then there's that  Wonderful scene  Where she vomits gelato  And Jägermeister  Into a butter  Why would she vomit 
[02:41:00]  Into a butter  You dummy  Got her stupid  Oh my god  She said  The most appalling  Of Norton's assertions  Is that Roberta's character  Based on the novel's author  Elizabeth Gilbert  Is just a bad  Irresponsible person  Trying to escape  From her failure  As a woman  And then that was  It's important Gray  Because no matter  How bad of a wife you are  No matter how horrible  Of an employee  First of all  Where is the thing  About failure as a woman  I say this because  She's divorced  And unemployed  So I'm addressing  Each point  And the fact that 
[02:41:30]  She was a wife  Well that's because  She's a woman  But I say employee  And how horrible  You are with money  Those are not  Gender specific  I am making fun of  I'm going  I'm answering the question  That Greg asked me  Right  I wish she was on the  Can we get her  Have you heard that  Or no  Are you just hearing this now  No I'm looking for the name  But I said it 10 minutes  To go on the air  I don't know you said it  I don't know how to spell it  Thank you  How come we just do it  You want me to scroll up  So you can see  Thank you  I said this 10 minutes ago  No you didn't say it  I did  Yeah right when we 
[02:42:00]  Thank you  Right when we started  The segment  Yes I've got it now  I know but 10 minutes ago  We were trying to  Can we find her  Oh my  Well the segment  Whatever  Oh god  Mind boggling  Come on  I mean there  It was a  Three and a half minute  Clip that we played  He could have been  In here while we were  Playing the clip  Whatever  Or just googled  The same thing  I told Danny to google  Yes  Did I do that on the air 
[02:42:30]  Or off the air  But you could really  Kind of find it  If you're the producer  You can find shit  You have to be able  To find shit  So  And that's how you  What's the name  I could find her number  It's just that  You know it's either  What's  Yeah yeah  Can you find her number  Can you try  I appreciate that  I didn't  Oh my god  Let's go to Jeff  In Cleveland  Jeff  Hey yeah  They only make  These kind of films  About self-discovery  And spirituality  About women  Oh maybe  They never make them  About guys  I couldn't name one  That isn't at least  A biopic 
[02:43:00]  And the reason why  Is because they're too boring  Only one would sit  Through this crap  But to imply  That it was based  In misogyny  Instead of just  This is a boring concept  To me  Because it's a boring concept  Again her assuming  That she knew  Where I was coming from  Was being misogynistic  Is what drives me  Fucking crazy  So irritating  And what's the movie about  She eats some good things  I don't know  She finds some  Spirituality  I don't know  Any more than she does  And a few lovers  Over there  And that makes her  A better person  When she comes back  To America  It's wonderful 
[02:43:30]  Yeah then it's fantastic  Okay  If you made the movie  With Anthony Bourdain  Or something  Then I might watch  Because it would be  Cynical and funny  And wouldn't the movie  Do better if it was  A frump in the lead role  Instead of  Julie Roberts  We're supposed to think  A hot piece of ass  Like Julie Roberts  Would have all this  Shit going wrong  She's getting to be  Frump  A little lower in the tooth  Yeah  Yeah she's definitely  In frump territory  She's still alright  Man she's still alright  Although she has  A witch's nose  Dude I gotta admit  That fucking perfume 
[02:44:00]  Stuff killed my throat  Oh I'm sorry man  Oh wow  That's a drag  Just like  Really?  I feel right at the  Base of my throat  Where my nose  And throat like meat  Oh man  It's like um  And I drank my water  And it had some in it  I guess it had settled  Alright cool  Maybe Steve will send  Them out to sell  The cologne soon  Steve  Are you mad at Steve?  Someone said  I'm annoyed  Because to me  That's just like  Come on man  We were doing this segment 
[02:44:30]  We should have been on this  A few minutes ago  And if you can't get her  I understand that  It's last minute  But to only come in  At that point  And ask  Does bother me  Yeah  Someone said  Steve just doesn't know  How to call a woman  And by the way  I do my Boneyard show  Here on Wednesdays  It's from 11 to 12  And then it replays  Some of the versions  Of the songs  They've been playing  Are not the ones  I asked for  And it's  It's really  Fucking annoying me  And then I hear  DC has given  Troy Kwan a hard time  So I would like  Somebody else in DC  To handle this  If the guy who's doing it  Is annoyed by doing it 
[02:45:00]  Maybe you have  A lot of shit you're doing  I get it  I don't get it  Edited versions or something  No no no  A little stupid thing  Like I did a lot  I do themes  And last week's theme  Was all live songs  And one of the versions  I wanted was  Fucking Ted Nugent  Doing  Wang Dang  Sweet Poontang  Because I love the version  Of Full Bluntal Nugent  I'm not a fan of Nugent  Or that song  But off that album  I like it  So they play a different version  I'm like this is shit  Why do they play  A different version  I don't know  Thank you very much  Was it another live version  It was 
[02:45:30]  But it wasn't what I asked for  And I put the album name  In parentheses  Why bother doing the show  If they're not playing  The songs you dig  This place is very confusing  Very  Extremely confusing  And Troy's giving him  The info  I know he is  Troy who  Oh hi Troy  Hey we got Sierra  From Ohio  Wants to say something  To Jimmy  Sierra  Happy birthday Jimmy  Thank you Sierra  Oh fuck  A pill popper  Love these girls  Go ahead Sarah  Hello Druggie  You need to stop  Drinking chamomile tea  While you're lactating

[02:51:30]  Yeah  Lightning hit a plane  Split it apart  And killed one person  As it was landing  Alright  Maybe  Oh  That could happen too  I saw a plane  Mishap in  The Caribbean  You saw it  You were on it  No  It was  You saw it on the news  Just now  Oh what happened  Yeah what happened  Motherfuckin  It went in the water 
[02:52:00]  What  Oh it went in the water  One of those  Yeah yeah  At least the water's  Warm down there  It's fine  Everyone survive  It's terrible  Yeah  It's terrible  I'm sorry  I just can't get over  This fucking  Steve  It's just  Like why wouldn't he  Leave a message  Because  Eat Pray Love  First of all  Was a massive book  I cannot tell you  How many weeks  That's on the bestseller list  I mean that was a  Massive book  Did that book  Get in the way of yours  It laughed at mine 
[02:52:30]  They're talking about it  Huh  What  Yeah there's a woman  Where  She's probably the author  Many different contexts  That people  Kind of suppress  Their independent thinking  Not different  Because they think  Are you saying brainwashing  They are talking about  This kind of yoga  I have to go pee again  Jesus  I'll be right  I have to piss badly  You're telling Jesus  Well fuck then  Let's take a break  I have to pee again  Jesus  Let's take a break  When we get back Anthony  Yeah  We all love the Hulkster  Right  Of course  He fucking roasted  Hasselhoff too  And you know 
[02:53:00]  He had to have  A very good  Good set there  For Mr. Hasselhoff  His comedic timing  Is second to none  Sure  We're gonna  Second to Steve  We're gonna listen to that  After the break  And some other things too  Nice  Stay there  The Virus  Sirius XM  This is the  O.P. and Anthony Show  I take a wheel  I take a wheel  Oh no  Foo Fighters fan Anthony 
[02:53:30]  Yeah  You like the Foo Fighters  I really am  Definitely like  The Foo Fighters  I caught another raccoon  Over the  Oh you did 
[02:54:00]  Yes  That's two down  Unless it was the same one  I'm just thinking  The exterminator guy  Takes it away  For a few days  Brings it back  Puts an empty trap there  With some bait in it  And then just sneaks back in  And switches the  Cage back again  With the raccoon in it  And I'm like  Oh look  Another one  Like well  We'll keep getting them  That's very cool  You got two  Yeah this one was  A lot more fun  He was very angry  Very upset  Did you ever learn  Where the raccoons go  No I don't see 
[02:54:30]  The guy that takes them away  Yeah  He shows up  For a very brief  Period of time  Goes by the side of the house  And just grabs the cage  And loads them in the truck  And off they go  To a better place  I believe  A happy place  A nice big field  Way out east  Long Island  Probably  In the Pine Barrens  Sure  Or somewhere  Out by the Hamptons  That's where they dump  The raccoons with rabies  Yeah I'm sure  Long Island allows that  No  The raccoons  They're dead  They take them 
[02:55:00]  To the raccoon circus  Down there in Florida  Raccoon circus  The raccoon circus  And Mr. Jangles  Go down there  To the raccoon circus  What would they do to Mr. Jangles?  Mr. Jangles  Percy stepped on him  That's funny  But you know  The big black guy  With the flies that came out  Of his mouth  Made him better  Mr. Jangles  Good old Mr. Jangles  I got a story about an asshole  You want to hear about an asshole?  What?  This is a fucking asshole  Isn't it?  Yes  Did you call? 
[02:55:30]  I thought I heard my name  This is the definition of an asshole  This fucking story  Produced  Yes  Lucky escape for boy  13  Hit by lightning  At 1313  On Friday  The 13th  What an asshole  Wow  Why would you be outside?  Yeah  Why would you step out  If you're 13  On Friday  That really happened  At 13  Did they look at his watch?  Young Benjamin Franklin  13 year old boy 
[02:56:00]  Was struck by lightning  At 1313 hours  On Friday the 13th  According to reports  The team was watching  An air show  In England  When he was struck  And was later treated  For burns to his shoulder  Burns  Expected to make  A full recovery  Suddenly there was  This huge crack of lightning  I just want to see  How they know  It was 1313  He had a minor burn  On his shoulder  And was taken to a hospital  A minor burn?  A minor burn  Oh  It could have been a lot worse  He said adding  It's all a bit strange  That he was 13 
[02:56:30]  And it happened at 1313  On Friday the 13th  I'm thinking  It was  The watch  He probably had a watch  That stopped working  Exactly when the lightning  Hit him  Yeah  And it was  1313  Which would be  1113  You know how we were  Trying to figure out  The Steve  Eat, pray, love  Fucking thing  Yeah  Rex in Massachusetts  Eat, gay, produce  Yes  I'm sure  Eat, do nothing  Eat 
[02:57:00]  Good old Steve  Keep doing what you're doing  A lot of people  Are saying that  That story  Is bullshit  Not quite buying it  Not quite buying it  Might be one of those  Little internet  Rumor stories  Oh really?  Just to keep everyone  Yeah  Not thinking about the war  When they do that  Not thinking about the war  Man  It's a distraction  That's why they do it  Man 
[02:57:30]  It's a bit strange  Ambulance team leader  Tells newspaper  Yeah  I don't know  Alright  And it happened in England  Give me the watch  They make up half their shit  Over there  They do  We're Sam  Hulk Hogan  Roasted fucking Hasselhoff  I heard it was terrific  Who did?  Hulk  Oh the Hulkster  The Hulkster  We love the Hulk  We're all about the Hulk  On this show man  If Hulk is doing something  We want to know about it  Right?  And he can deliver a line  Knows exactly 
[02:58:00]  How to deliver a comedic line  We've heard it before  He's a very funny man  Hulk Hogan  Well yeah  We were just playing  Like last week  What he's doing in TNA now  And you guys were loving that  It's just the best  Yeah  The Hulkster  It's fantastic  Remember how well you said he yelled  He is a good yeller  What you doing now  He certainly is  Jimmy  He was one of the  He's roasting  Instead of you  You know  Comedy Central decided  Hulk Hogan needs to roast  David Hasselhoff  Not a comedian like Jim Norton  That should drive you fucking nuts  No that doesn't 
[02:58:30]  Because they may actually be friends  And to me that's the spirit of the roast  If those guys know each other  A lot of times they're not friends  I've learned over the years  I don't know  You'd think they're friends  But they just kind of pick people  From all walks of life  Fake friend  Also there's something in the delivery  That tells me that maybe  Hulk Hogan might not have written  Every joke himself  What?  That's right  No  He  I  No he's a funny guy  I bet you he wrote his own material  For the roast  Seth MacFarlane intros Hulk  And Hulk takes a risk 
[02:59:00]  And starts with wrestling material  I mean you know  He is risky  He doesn't go for the safe stuff  Oh cool  Our next roaster  Is an athlete  A performer  And a father  I want to play a game  Can I have the bell  Or do you want to do it?  I want to know  How many  Catch for  I want you to pop that bell  Every time Hulk Hogan says brother  Oh  Oh a Hogan  Catch phrase  You need a carpal tunnel  Oh Jesus  Is brother the big one here?  He likes to say that word  Yeah  Let's see  And Hulk 
[02:59:30]  May I say  Your daughter Brooke Hogan  Has blossomed into a very  Very beautiful young man  Oh  Oh shit  Oh  Oh shit  He said it  Wow  Seth MacFarlane  Family guy  Good one  Doing a good job as the host  Master  The Hulkster wasn't  Wasn't happy with that joke  He wasn't amused by it?  He didn't seem  To be taking it  That's what happens at a roast  Exactly  Old fucking  Rotten broom wig  Getting a water delivery  From Poland Springs  Greg Giraldo said 
[03:00:00]  I love my cameras  He said they should have changed  He just said I love my life  Should have changed  Hulk Hogan's  TV show from  Hogan Knows Best  To Hogan Grows Breasts  Because he's old  And has a bitch tinnies  Who said that?  Giraldo  Wow  Giraldo rules  Holy shit  Fucking  That's brutal man  Hey wife  Hulk 
[03:00:30]  Later on when these jokes  Are explained to you  You're going to be so pissed  Please welcome  The next great sports star  To die  Hulk Hogan  He had his big bandana  And bow up  There we go  Time for war  Hey Lisa  How's it going brother? 
[03:01:00]  That's fine  Hey  Dude  You know I haven't seen you  Since you beat my ass  In Wrestlemania 4  Of course  Back in those days  Lisa wrestled  Under the name  Andre the Vagiant  What was the visual joke?  I didn't get it  Lisa Lampanelli  Hey brother  She was Andre the Vagiant  That's not bad  For a wrestler 
[03:01:30]  Why are you sticking up  For the Hulkster?  I'm not  You don't have to  No no dude  Let him eat his balls  Dude I'm not  It's so much more fun  If he eats his balls  I have to be truthful  Believe me  I'll kill him  If I thought it was douchey  But that's not bad  To attack Lisa  You know  Calling her brother  I can accept  Brother  Alright  Let's continue  Of course I recognize  Jeff backstage  His face all puffy  Red and stubbly  He looks like something  Pam Anderson  I'm sorry 
[03:02:00]  Do I have to say this?  Want to still  Defend your friend  The Hulkster there?  You can tell  If you listen to his voice  What happened?  He drops the  He probably thought  That this part  Would be  Clipped in editing  And Comedy Central  Decided  No  Let's make him  Look stupid  Pam Anderson  I'm sorry  Do I have to say this? 
[03:02:30]  Alright  He looks like something  Pam Anderson  Had burned off her  P***  Hilarious  Holy shit  Cliver  Why wouldn't you say that?  Because he's  He's fucked up  That's why  And then he was  Trying to cover himself  Yeah  He read wrong  Pam Anderson  Yeah he read wrong  And then he was  Trying to cover himself  That's what that was about  Yeah  And he didn't write  Any of this stuff 
[03:03:00]  I hope not  Of course not  Seriously Hoff  Brother  Doesn't it bother you  That your career  Is in the same toilet  That Lisa drinks out of?  That's also funny  But brother I love you man  And I hope you keep on  Doing your thing Hoff  Because when you're gone  There's nobody that will  Ever take your place  Except maybe that guy  From Airwolf  Well I guess in closing  There's just one question 
[03:03:30]  To ask you Hoff  So what you gonna do brother  When nobody  Will hire you  And then he rips his shirt off  Right right  But under his Hulkamania shirt  He had another red and yellow shirt  That said suck it Hoff  All right  Suck it Hoff  That was kind of fun  Yeah you know  That was fun  I don't hold him  To the same standards  As a comedian  Exactly  If they're friends  He belongs on it  But if they're not friends  He doesn't 
[03:04:00]  He's just up there  Doing his thing  Yeah it must be fun  Being the Hulkster  People say he played  Lisa Lampanelli  Ripping against the Hulk  Did she have a good set?  Lisa was probably good  Yeah I go pull  Lisa Lampanelli  If you want  She's good at those things  Or maybe we could all  Just watch the roast  Watch the  It's the only way  I'll know what goes on there  Oh Jimmy  Yeah  Jimmy  I'm not good enough  Oh Jimmy  I'm not good enough  You're so good  You're so good  You're so good is right  You're funny  Oh damn 
[03:04:30]  Come on  Do you just want to  Bite their faces Jimmy?  No  It is what it is  Stay with it  What happened?  Well the camera's  Fucking up  At this car chase  In Los Angeles  Why there's a crash  They're going to cut it anyway  I know  Is that their thing now?  Yeah they cut it  Which one are they chasing Ant?  I know  I think the white pickup  Oh  But it's not really  Going that fast now  But it was going really fast  Dude  There's no way 
[03:05:00]  To get away from a fucking  Unless you park  In an underground  Mall parking lot  Yeah  And have a change of  I mean there's nothing  You're going to do  Yeah the helicopter's got you  Mmhmm  Boy  They now run that helicopter  It's just huge in LA  Happen all the time  Oh he's picking up speed again  There he goes  Ah he's feeling ballsy  On those freeways  Look at the sun's  Right in his eyes too  It's like  Yeah what is this  Sun's just coming up  In California  So the sun is  Right in his fucking eyes  657  What could the guy  Have possibly done 
[03:05:30]  At 657 in the morning  It's probably  Trying to go to work  He's like me  He's just trying to  Get to work on time  What is with this  Fucking choppy  Lousy camera  I know  The stupid helicopters  Probably got some  Cheap fucking thing on it  Do you think a helicopter  Like uh  Guy keeps looking  In front of him  To make sure  He doesn't hit something  I keep thinking  The helicopter's  Going to run into something  But he won't  I think  I think one guy  Runs the camera  And one guy  Flies the helicopter  Oh I thought  It was one man 
[03:06:00]  Going backwards  Because he's  Flying on the left side  Going backwards  Just one guy  Yeah this guy's just  Where are the cops though  I haven't seen  One fucking police car  Maybe they're behind him  Or they'll pull  I would assume  They're behind him  Where's the fuzz  But uh  Pickup truck  Ain't gonna do that  Alright innocent man  Freed  Black guy coming up  On CNN  Freed and a green  I wonder how long  Was he in jail for  Where's the innocent guy  Oh Ant don't be fresh  Oh stop  Come on 
[03:06:30]  I was kidding  Of course  It's a joke  I have so fucking  Turned against a death penalty  Have you really  Oh I can't have it  I don't know  For that reason only  But I think a lot of  Death penalty cases  Are pretty ironclad  A lot are  I don't think  They just take  One person's  Eyewitness  Report  Wow  We just shot  Across four lanes  Nicely  Yeah good move  I think that a lot  Of them are  You know I think  A lot of them  Are ironclad  But until all of them  Are ironclad  I can't be for it 
[03:07:00]  It's not right  I'm for it  But unless you are  Absolutely sure  We're never gonna  Give them life  But that's what  They say now  We're never gonna  Have a perfect system  We might lose a few  Innocent ones  For the good of everyone  Who said that  I would rather see  Ten guilty men  Be set free  Than one innocent man  I don't agree with  Being set free  But put to death  You can't have that  Wow look at this move  Nice  Now I'm  Swing back  To the slow lane  He's not really  Going that fast  And yet where are  The cops  He is though  He's going fast  Because they're all  Doing 60 
[03:07:30]  And he's zipping  Right past them  This guy was  Going any faster  It would seem like  A turtle racing  A bunch of  Rabbit racing  A bunch of turtles  Amy in Alabama  Wants to talk to  Jim Norton  Amy  A lot of Jimmy fans  Today  What you gonna do  Amy what up  Hi what's up guys  What's up  I'm here with my  Cousin  Kirsten  Say hey Kirsten  Hello
