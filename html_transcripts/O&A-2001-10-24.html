<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a promotion encouraging listeners to display "WOW" stickers on their vehicles.  The hosts reviewed its success (or lack thereof) in various cities, highlighting strong performance in New York, Philly, Boston, Cleveland, and Buffalo, contrasted with poor results in San Francisco, Chicago, and Columbus.  A listener from Columbus reported their local station cutting the show short after the "Whip Em Out Wednesday" segment.  They discussed an upcoming road trip to Washington D.C. and received several listener calls providing updates on local participation and reception of the promotion, including complaints about airtime and a claim of another station stealing their idea. The low San Francisco ratings were compared to a local Vietnamese station.  A listener from Fort Worth, Texas, who had driven to a previous show, was also mentioned.

The show then transitioned to a humorous, crude bit mocking Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather's reporting on anthrax scares.  The hosts fabricated ridiculous disease announcements and sexual escapades for Brokaw to boost ratings, followed by speculation on terrorist anthrax distribution methods, contrasting it with news portrayals. This segued into a discussion of their office cleanliness and spoiled food received from a Chicago radio station.  They also discussed the "Boob-a-lantern contest," lamenting low participation and describing the prizes. This segment concluded with the appearance of "Stalker Patty," a Make-A-Wish participant with a rare disease, whose recent head shaving for U2 concert tickets and new wig became a focal point of crude jokes about her age, virginity, and lack of sexual experience, with comedian Colin Quinn briefly joining the conversation.  Patty's earlier encounter with Ron Jeremy for YouTube tickets was also revealed.

The next segment featured women from Double D's bar in Morristown, promoting a benefit for World Trade Center victims.  The conversation quickly devolved into sexually explicit jokes and descriptions of the women's bodies, including breast implants, lap dances, and other sexual acts offered at the bar.  Photos were taken for the "Boobalanter" contest. Further discussion of “Stalker Patty’s” photos, including one with a mohawk, and a call from Eric commenting on website photos followed.  The introduction of Sandy Kane, a performer known for shocking acts like setting her breasts on fire, dramatically escalated the sexual content. The discussion included her body modification ("Twato"), with Colin Quinn again present and participating.  Numerous commercial breaks were mentioned throughout.

The following segment began with a chaotic scene involving a lit match and hair, described as resembling "CNN footage of the attack on Khyber Pass,"  and a caller, Jack, reporting a studio mishap with Preparation H.  Phil, another caller, recounted a previous encounter with Sandy and a sound effect related to a request for "two digits." The introduction of Sandy Kane shifted the focus to a growth on her body, referred to as "Twato," later revealed to be suspected genital warts, leading to much argument and speculation.  George Carlin then called in, was shown pictures of "Twato," and offered his usual comedic commentary interspersed with political views, notably his opinion on resolving conflict ("You've got to kill certain people"), while promoting his HBO special, "Complaints and Grievances."  The segment concluded with continued discussion of Sandy's growth, listener contest mentions,  the smell of a stripper's outfit,  jokes about Patty's body odor, and excerpts from a Ted Knight novelty record.  A comparison between Sandy and Lynn’s physical attributes fueled by Sandy’s anger continued throughout, punctuated by crude humor and sexually explicit references.

The final segment featured a chaotic and sexually explicit interview with Sandy Kane, detailing various encounters, including a motel incident with the hosts and backup singers.  The conversation included crude jokes, references to sex acts, insults, and Sandy Kane performing an a cappella song with lyrics referencing Osama bin Laden and killing Americans, all accompanied by bizarre and vulgar commentary from the hosts.  Colin Quinn's appearance at Caroline's the next night was mentioned.  Significant time was devoted to graphic and insulting descriptions of Sandy Kane's breasts, along with discussions of her public access show and the hosts' opinions on her appearance. Listener calls, promotion of Sandy Kane's show, Colin Quinn's appearance, and the Opie and Anthony Halloween event, along with money given to Patty, concluded with further sexually charged banter and promotion of various events and websites.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  And yes, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Yeah, we'll brag a little bit.  The greatest radio promotion ever.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  And it's so easy to do, Anthony, right?  Oh my God.  All you gotta do is put a wow on your vehicle somewhere.  That's it.  That's all you gotta do, and then you're in it.  And a girl sees your wow,  knows that you would enjoy seeing her beautiful breasts being flashed at you.  And she'll do it. 
[00:00:30]  It's like fishing.  Eventually, you get on there long enough, it'll happen for you.  A lot of the cities that we broadcast in have the wow stickers.  Yes.  Some don't because they really don't care about us.  Ah, well.  They just slap our radio show on their station  and just assume it's going to do well on its own.  Hope for the best.  Chicago.  That's some ungodly hour.  Ah, well.  Chicago blows. 
[00:01:00]  Not the city, the station we're on.  Because they could give a flying F we're part of their station.  If you don't want us, just call up Ken Stevens, our boss,  and we'll go somewhere else.  Yeah, we could do that.  We'll find someone that will appreciate the O.P. and Anthony show.  Okay?  I think we've shown that in the proper time slot, like a live, seems to help this program.  And it does very well.  Seems every city we're on live, we're doing very well. 
[00:01:30]  You're right, Andrew.  Yeah.  And then when they put us on at some ungodly hour...  Chicago, Dallas, Rochester, to a certain extent.  Nothing going on in the ratings.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And San Francisco, you might as well just turn off the power.  40th place.  We're in 40th place in San Francisco.  We're already in.  Well, that's something to shoot for then.  See, if we're going to be a real radio show and, you know, give you a dose of reality...  Yeah.  We've got to give you the other side, too. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  In San Francisco, we're in 40th place.  40th place.  That's...  Not fourth.  We're basically...  40th.  Broadcasting on a...  On a...  On a CB channel in San Francisco.  CB.  No joke.  Breaker, breaker for the O&A show.  Breaker, breaker, good buddy.  You've got a smoky report.  I'll see some attractive seat covers in that pregnant roller skate.  Remember, double nickels all the way.  40th place in San Francisco. 
[00:02:30]  Barely a blip on the radar screen in San Fran.  Barely.  Maybe they don't like our gay humor.  Do we do gay humor?  Well, at times, and sure.  All right.  It's not all-inclusive, guys.  Right.  We have to be all-inclusive.  All-inclusive.  How's that for a chopper?  So anyway, yeah, it's Whipman Day.  Tolerant.  We have to be tolerant.  And here in New York, it's a beautiful day.  It's like summer in New York today. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  From what I hear, one of the last of the nice days that we're going to have.  And for all the cities that are listening to this in the dark, well, I guess Whipman  Wednesday doesn't really work for you now, does it?  No.  Maybe that's just another piece of the puzzle in Chicago.  A huge, fun promotion that we have.  Wow.  Can't be done.  Can't be done.  Can't be done.  Can't be done in the dark.  Oh, well.  Unless the girls, I don't know, light up their boobs.  They can put that little camera on like in Afghanistan where the guy's eyes glow in the dark. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  Yeah, that's a good look.  Maybe if you could get some of that night vision, you'll see the girls flashing.  Yeah, drive around with night vision goggles.  You know, it'll be in a green tint like we're seeing on TV.  Yeah.  Dallas is good, though, because you guys have that coveted 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. spot.  Yes.  10 to 2, yeah.  10 to 2.  10 to 2.  But, you know, I'm hearing things.  They even know how ridiculous it is to have us on that late.  So we'll see what happens there.  I think some of the stations, they look and say, all right, we're looking at New York. 
[00:04:00]  We're looking at Philly.  We're looking at Boston.  Hmm.  Even we're looking at Cleveland.  Cleveland doing really well.  Buffalo.  We've only been on the air like a month, month and a half.  We're doing really well already.  And then they got to look and say, okay, what's the difference between our version here of the Opie and Anthony show,  what we're doing with it, and theirs?  Hmm.  And then they figure maybe if we put them on at the hour they're supposed to be on. 
[00:04:30]  The station we're on in Chicago blows so bad.  Yeah.  Everyone is talking in the market, wondering if the station will even be around the first of the year.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So they're one of the odds they'll change formats before January 1st.  Wondering if they're going to be around.  So they're like the Gary Wall of stations.  Yeah.  People talking, wondering if they were going to be around.  Hmm.  They know what they're doing, though, because the station's doing quite well everywhere else. 
[00:05:00]  Sure.  40th.  So, yeah, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, and we couldn't be happier here in New York.  A lot of people are already checking in and saying, wow, there's some action out here today.  Oh, sure.  Beautiful day.  So, yeah, just put a wow on the back of your car, whether it's the wow bumper sticker or a homemade wow sign.  We love the homemade wow signs.  Yes.  I was up in Boston over the weekend, and I've got to tell you, the homemade wow signs made me proud.  And they're great to see.  All over the place in the Boston area, almost as proud as seeing a flag on all their vehicles. 
[00:05:30]  Now seeing the wow.  A flag and wow.  At least you don't see the wows laying in the street, being run over, because people are irresponsible with their flags.  I swear to God, on the way in, I passed three of them.  They're getting smarter, though.  In the gutter.  You've got the wow flag that goes in the window now.  You have to roll up the window all the way, and it's safe.  Oh, the flag that goes in the top of the window.  Right.  You've got to roll the window up.  Stays nice, but then you forget that you have that contraption.  You want a little fresh air.  You let the windows down, and there goes your flag. 
[00:06:00]  It flops off.  I've seen them just.  And now all the other ones that are taped onto antennas are just tattered.  Right.  They're just these tattered, threaded messes.  Yeah.  But the ones in the street, I swear, three of them I saw against the center divider, just laying in the gutter.  People, I'm patriotic.  Where'd my flag go?  So, flittering down to the ground.  All right.  So, yeah, if it's a homemade wow, that works just as well.  And some of the cities, you've got to have patience. 
[00:06:30]  By the spring, I'm telling you, wow will be huge in your city.  As long as we're broadcasting during the day.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Jesse.  Jesse, what's going on?  Oh, man.  I'm out here in Columbus.  You guys rock.  Well, the only problem is they are.  We're not seeing much love from Columbus, either.  We forgot about Columbus.  Cleveland, good.  Columbus, no.  We're not feeling it.  It seems like, you know, Ohio.  Cleveland, Ohio.  Nice.  Columbus, Ohio.  Eh. 
[00:07:00]  They don't really find us with it.  I guess they're not getting it.  As far as everybody that I know thinks you guys rock.  I mean, Matt, where I work at, we have you all on all the radios out here.  But y'all need to call the manager up here for 107.1.  They dumped you all like a hot cake when y'all came on explaining about what that Wednesday was.  And it's not been the first time.  It's like they're afraid that they can see some woman's beautiful breath.  Wait, they dump out when we described wow on the big wazoo? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, they dumped you all out.  Wait, wait, the start of the show today?  Yeah.  I mean, it was dead air silence for a good 15 seconds.  And then, poof, they cut back in right after it.  Wait, what we say is that you put a wow on your vehicle, right?  And then a woman will see the wow on your vehicle.  And if she feels so inclined, she will flash her breasts at you. 
[00:08:00]  And I've got the best vehicle for it.  I drive around in a big, white, silver-lined van with no windows on the bottom of the bottom.  Wow's all open.  Jesse, we're trying to get to the bottom of something.  Did you hear us explain wow that time?  It came in right at the end of it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Someone with a brain in Columbus.  We need your help today.  I don't think there's a brain in Columbus.  We need someone from Seaboss to give us a call right now.  My God.  And let us know what's going on. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  Hey, Jesse.  Thank you.  Call any time.  Thank you so much, Jesse.  Thank you.  You guys rock.  All right.  There you go.  Jesse.  In Columbus.  The dumbest individual in the country right now.  We should tell people how much going on in Columbus as far as our ratings go as well.  Now, I can't understand.  They talk to us every day about the radio show, right, Ben?  Huh?  Yeah, good.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  And anywhere else, including Washington, D.C., baby. 
[00:09:00]  They're starting to wake up in Washington, D.C.  Wake up, Washington.  I saw a design for the Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  Yep.  That will be in Washington, D.C. in the near future.  Oh, beautiful.  And we're going to be taking a little road trip to Washington in the very near future.  We'll have details later on this week, early next week.  Okay?  I would say very near future.  Yeah, we'll be there very soon.  We just got to figure out exactly what we're going to do.  Yeah.  And then we'll let everyone else know. 
[00:09:30]  Okay?  And we're hoping for a bunch of people in the New York area to do the road trip thing with us.  We're kind of enjoying that.  Yeah.  Went down to Philly, had a great time, and a lot of people from New York went there.  We're going to Boston Monday and Tuesday.  A lot of people from New York taking the trip north.  Yeah.  Come on with us.  We encourage that.  I read an email from a guy from Fort Worth.  He drove from Fort Worth, Texas, to Philly to check us out at that road show.  Wow.  Fort Worth, Texas.  I swear to God.  And said he had an unbelievable time.  How many hookers did he strangle on the way up? 
[00:10:00]  Hey, Jay, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O-A-N-N?  Yeah, N's here today.  Hey, I just wanted to ask you guys, who else listens in the Bay Area besides me?  Well, you got West Coast Dave.  West Coast Dave.  He'd rather listen to us on the computer, though, because he says it comes in better on the computer than through his radio.  Oh, yeah, you guys are on a crappy little AM station out there.  Yeah, that's what we hear.  It has trouble getting through some tough barriers like air.  Now, what were your ratings compared to, like, the Vietnamese station? 
[00:10:30]  In San Francisco?  Yeah.  What are the call letters of the Vietnamese station?  We'll let you know.  We're in 40th place.  I can't imagine anyone is below us.  Yeah.  How many stations could they possibly have in the San Francisco area?  Actually, no, there is a fair amount because some of the San Jose stations, which is, like, basically an hour away from us,  they, even though they're in San Jose, they try to consider themselves San Francisco stations.  I mean, that talks on a bit, I don't know, maybe 10, 15, more there. 
[00:11:00]  I think it's safe to say that the Vietnamese station is beating us.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no, that's not good.  Coming soon to the O&A show, more gook talk.  Oh, wow.  Seriously, no.  I mean, we've got this big Asian population out here.  Just so we can relate.  I'm surprised they don't like us because the wow letters are yellow.  Yeah.  Just like that.  Hey, we need wow stickers out here.  You know, San Francisco is the place that the guys shipped out from.  Hey, Jay.  From Vietnam.  So when they came back bringing their little dink wives with them, if I may call them that. 
[00:11:30]  Is that derogatory?  No.  I don't even know anymore.  At all.  They would bring them back and have their family.  And before you know it, the Vietnamese radio station is doing very well.  And we're in 40th place.  Jay?  Yeah.  You said you want wow stickers?  Yeah.  Slow down.  Okay, well, no, no, no.  I already got mine.  And I sent my self-addressed stamped envelope to 1027-WNEW.  But we need some more for us.  Well, you know what?  Let's start with getting some listeners. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  And that's where you can help.  You take a megaphone and repeat everything we're saying out your window.  We'll get more listeners.  Yeah.  Okay.  But there is a station in San Jose, which also has Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Well, that would be.  I think they ripped it off from you guys.  Well, that would be Lamont and Tonelli.  And they know damn well they took wow from us.  It's well documented.  We came up with it a long time ago.  Aw.  Unfortunately, we're not on a big enough station where we can really do some damage and let  everyone know that, you know, they completely took that from us.  Actually, talk to the Clear Channel station in San Jose, KSJO, because the guy that they 
[00:12:30]  got out in the afternoon now, Mikey, sucks ass.  Uh, Jay?  Yeah.  Uh, Clear Channel hates our guts.  Oh, yeah.  You guys are infinity.  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  What is Lamont and Tonelli?  Lamont and Tonelli, it's the morning show out there.  Out here.  Yeah, it's the wacky show of the, uh, out there.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  There you go.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Uh, Joan, what's going on? 
[00:13:00]  Hi, guys.  Hi.  You guys are doing just the best job.  I started listening to you guys right around, uh, September 11th, uh.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and you guys are just the best.  I usually turned off guys, and you are just the best.  Where are you listening to us?  Out of, uh, Herndon, Virginia.  Of course.  Um, right outside of D.C.?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, what I'm calling about.  Look at me, make them believe I know where that is.  Yeah, yeah.  I was down there for a little bit, about three years ago or so. 
[00:13:30]  I had a great time, yeah.  Yeah.  I went, I went to a barbecue down in that area.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll say about 25 minutes outside of D.C.  No, and don't you have family down there?  I was convicted of sodomy in front of me.  Oh, that was it.  I'm sorry.  It was sodomy with a family member, though, right?  Oh, good, good.  I knew there was a family thing in front of me.  All right.  You know what's sodomy?  We're still being local.  That's good.  We're only, like, 20 minutes from D.C.  The program directors are proud right now.  Look at my boys being local for our city.  Good.  So what were you going to say, Joan?  Okay.  Well, anyway, um, we have a lack of participation with Whipham at Wednesday. 
[00:14:00]  I see no cars, nothing.  Joan, it's way too early for Washington, D.C.  We know that.  I mean, they're, I can think of...  They're going to get the bumper stickers done within a week or two.  Unfortunately, now we're heading toward colder weather, so, you know, it's going to have  an effect when spring hits.  That's for sure.  Well, I can think of, like, six of my friends that would be very willing participants.  Ah.  Okay.  Ah.  Well, if you're digging the show in Washington, D.C., the easiest way is to put the homemade 
[00:14:30]  wow on the back of the car.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen one of those since I started listening to D.C.  Well, that's not bad.  That's a start.  That's a start.  But anyway, I just wanted to say good job.  You guys are hysterical.  Oh, thank you.  And keep it up.  All right, thanks.  All right, thanks.  Bye.  We're going to get to the bottom of the Columbus situation here.  Michelle's on the line.  Michelle?  Hello.  What's up?  Oh, not too much.  I've been listening to you guys, and it did dump out once earlier, but the rest of us  come, you know, through clear.  Well, maybe they had a problem.  What do they dump out of?  We haven't done anything bad yet. 
[00:15:00]  I know.  But I heard when you were talking to that other guy from Columbus, when you repeated all about  whip them out Wednesdays, it came through fine.  Oh, so maybe the guy got an itchy finger on the dump button down there.  Probably.  Is there what they call a glitch?  All right.  Or a glitch.  But I love listening to you guys.  Keep it up.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Thank you.  All right.  So there you go.  There's the syndicated update, I think.  Did we cover it all?  I think so.  Sacramento, you forgot.  Well, know why we haven't talked about Sacramento?  And we do have some action at KXOA. 
[00:15:30]  KXOA.  KXOA.  The ratings come out today, I believe.  Ah.  Or tomorrow.  That's the only reason we haven't really talked about them.  Ah.  We're wondering.  We'll wait and see on that.  Okay.  We're in a wait and see position there.  But so far, so good in Sacramento.  Sure.  We know we got a little bit of a buzz going on.  There's something going on.  Something going on.  Feeling it.  What happened to your chin?  What?  A little...  I got a little Band-Aid on my...  A little square Band-Aid.  Did you nick yourself shaving?  No, I've been ripping out a scam for the last three months. 
[00:16:00]  Should have said yes to the shaving.  Anthrax.  I know.  Anthrax.  Anthrax.  Anyway, Anthony, good news.  We don't have Anthrax.  No, so far we don't.  So far.  There's something going on in our office, though.  Yeah, I noticed you were a little nervous.  I'm nervous now in the office asking people if they feel itchy when they leave the office.  I feel itchy all the time in our office.  I feel itchy.  And every time I put my book bag down on that damn rug, there are critters in that rug, I'm telling you. 
[00:16:30]  Well, this goes long before Anthrax.  These are critters that have been there for quite a while.  Oh, I know.  It has nothing to do with Anthrax.  I understand that.  Yeah.  But there is something going on in our office.  Do you think we got fleas?  Something.  Mites, head lice, nits.  Could be from that damn food that Chicago sent us.  Shiggers.  See, we started off well with Chicago, and ever since.  Oh, the food.  Did you hear about that, Morton?  Yeah, how you didn't open the box of food for months.  For months.  And then we opened it.  It was the worst smell.  It smelled like a dead corpse. 
[00:17:00]  That was rotting.  It was horrendous.  Lovely.  But something is going on in the office, and I'm itchy every day now.  Do you have little bug bites?  What are you doing, Rick?  What?  It just opens mail anywhere now.  It doesn't even matter.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, wouldn't you not open anything in the studio?  Well, no.  Don't you not?  Well, no, no.  I don't care where it's.  Sent by a publisher.  I don't care.  Like, if something's filled out.  You're an idiot.  If something's filled out.  Hold on.  I've got to get involved in this.  Sent by a publisher.  It must be good.  It must be fine.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  If you were a terrorist, wouldn't you come up with another means to get your anthrax out of there?  Because we know the homemade wow with the writing, you know, that starts up here and goes way down here.  Now we're looking out for that one.  Do you not understand what letter?  If I'm Mr. Smart Terrorist, I'm going to go, you know what?  It's been already scanned.  It's got other eyes.  Did you see the one sent to Brokaw?  You know who that was from?  Kids.  Yeah, a fourth grader instead.  So you would open it and go, it's a fourth grader.  Do you know what would happen if something spilled out of there in this studio? 
[00:18:00]  This show and the rest of the shows after would be off the air immediately for I don't know how long.  If I was Mr. Smart Terrorist Anthrax guy, I would, you know, think of another way to get my anthrax out.  Of course.  You're not going to, like I said, write it with the sideways writing, like the retard that can't keep the words straight.  You're not going to have the prison letter writing.  Yeah.  And incidentally, I really, I don't, I don't think that a fourth grader sent that to Tom Brokaw.  You don't?  No, originally I did, but I don't anymore. 
[00:18:30]  A fourth grader with Samantha, like Rick.  Right here in the studio.  I don't think, I don't think anything.  I don't think you could call me paranoid for saying, I don't think anything, any curious, should be opened up in the studio.  Do you agree?  It's a book.  Oh my God.  I agree.  You are so thick.  Because you're crazy.  I'm not crazy.  You're not.  All right.  I hope you like Cipro.  Jerry, what's up? 
[00:19:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just want to let you know, in case you were curious, KVVNAM is the Vietnamese station out there.  I just checked it out in an SRDS book.  Is the VM like Vietnam or something?  All right, wait, let me write this down.  Sure.  When we go to break, I will see if we're beating the Vietnamese station in San Francisco.  And they don't even speak English, right?  Most likely?  No, I don't know.  I'm not familiar with the station itself.  I just looked it up in an SRDS book.  I hear Jane Fonda is a guest every day.  She loves that station. 
[00:19:30]  All right, Jerry.  Thank you.  No problem, guys.  We'll look it up and see if we're beating the Vietnamese station.  I doubt it.  I doubt it, too.  All right, Anthony, I was starting to say that the pictures of Stalker Patty's shaving are up on opiananthony.com.  Yeah, I saw those last night.  I went to the site, checked it out.  I got to tell you, I saw the pictures late last night.  I needed to share with somebody, so I went into the Foundry Music chat room just to tell people that the pictures were up.  I couldn't even talk to the people.  I was laughing so freaking hard last night. 
[00:20:00]  See, every picture, funny.  The pictures with her with her own hair are funny.  I don't know why you took them so close that they're funny.  Her getting the hair got funny.  And then her with that goddamn wig.  Now, a lot of people have seen her outside the building today with the wig.  Yeah, with the wig.  And Tim Sabian, our fine program director down there in Philly, he calls up and he goes,  Hey, you know, I got to tell you, that wig doesn't look too bad.  Something happened when Rick took the picture.  You guys got to understand, the wig that Patty is wearing for the next three to four months, it probably costs us five bucks. 
[00:20:30]  At least.  It is jet black and it looks plastic.  It's a plastic wig.  She's like a retarded Lego person.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, look at that picture.  It does not look real.  But for some reason, let me see.  For some reason, the picture, see, that picture looks kind of normal.  Like, that could be her real hair.  You guys got to understand, the picture of Patty with the wig, that is a plastic hair jet black wig. 
[00:21:00]  That is truly the Uma Thurman Pulp Fiction hair.  She looks like Drezner.  Drezner.  And it looks like Rick.  And she looks like Geddy Lee when we did the mullet.  The mullet, it was definitely Geddy.  And then with the Mohawk, someone made a taxi driver poster with Patty as De Niro.  It's hilarious.  Are you talking to me?  I don't even know where that is.  I saw it last night.  It's on one of our websites.  Yeah.  She looks rather sporty in that picture.  Sassy and sporty.  So the pictures are up on www.opiananthony.com or, you know, foundrymusic.com has them as well, okay?

[00:36:30]  what kind of car do you drive tom  and i drive a liolo miata  oops i don't think i can say that  dammit  i met me and sam champion went to the roxy  it was fabulous  but you know i'm in competition now with dan rather from cbs  i was the only network anchor that ever received anthrax 
[00:37:00]  now it seems i'm in a disease competition with dan faster  but i have anthony's foot fungus and a sore on my lip i don't know what it is  i don't think old dandy dan  come up with that  as a matter of fact  get  get dan rather on the phone  i gotta call him  cause uh  i i heard dan

[00:38:00]  Hello, Dan Rather's office, please.  This is Dan Rather's office.  Hello, Dan, do you have Prince Albert in a can?  No.  Yes.  Well, you better let him out unless he has the anthrax.  Oh, look at that.  No mail delivery, but airborne delivery to Dan Rather.  Airborne, get it? 
[00:38:30]  Thank you, Tom.  NBC Nightly News.  I am now eating sheep.  Because I hear that they could give you a good disease that will boost my rating.  I'm both at NBC Nightly News.  You know, when I relax at night, I like smoking five packs of camel non-filters.  Camel non-filters.  If I get lung cancer, I'm going to kick Dan Rather's ass in the rating. 
[00:39:00]  I can only hope something goes wrong.  I'm getting my stomach stapled.  That seems to be a very popular thing to do, even though I'm not very heavy.  I want a lung x-ray every night.  You can catch me on location.  I'm going to be working at a D.C. post office, breathing deeply.  Hey, why are there any white people working at the D.C. post office? 
[00:39:30]  Did you see that?  It looks like a f***ing unemployment line.  Whoa!  But you know, folks, I've got to tell you.  I'm sorry, that wasn't a socially acceptable term.  I believe we should keep bombing the sand f***ing, those cowl-headed f***ers, until they're blasted off. 
[00:40:00]  If you're camel jockey sand f***ers, bop, now it's fine.  Tom, you sound a little drunk today.  I go home.  I got home about nine-ish in the morning.  Right.  Nine-ish in the morning.  And I down an entire glass of scotch.  Then I down another.  Then I hop in my Miata and drive. 
[00:40:30]  Because if I get into a car accident drunk, my ratings is high rocket.  Let's see if you rather do that.  Come over to NBC Nightly News.  I am having gay sex with Dan Rather.  Me and Dan are f***ing each other hard.  Every night.  Trying to see who gets to him first.  First I had sex with a green monkey. 
[00:41:00]  Then I put it where the sun don't shine with Dan Rather.  Then we put Al Walker on the rotisserie and play cards in his back.  Give him a little reach around.  Boy, he's got nice s***s.  What a s***s.  What a s***s.  NBC Nightly News.  This just in. 
[00:41:30]  Rocco has anthrax.  So.  Hey.  Hey, I got anthrax, Dave.  I got it from my boss's office and you can get it all week long.  Anthrax.  He stole the Cipro and he's distributing it.  I'll be on a billboard till I drop dead of anthrax.  Dave. 
[00:42:00]  This just in.  Rocco has anthrax.  NBC Nightly News.  The fat s*** from Worcester Radio.  Has the tracks.  Hoping to bolster his floundering ratings.  Hey, Tom.  I have to interrupt you for a second.  There are three really hot chicks outside the studio right now.  Are they part of the Booba Lantern contest?  I can hope so.  Are they?  They're from Double D's.  They're from Double D's.  Ah. 
[00:42:30]  I was hoping they were some diseased Haitian girl.  Because there's no herpy like tongue herpy.  I think.  It's visual.  So when I say NBC Nightly News, you go,  what the f*** is on her on Habraka's tongue?  It looks like some kind of smallpox.  Billy.  Yeah.  What's up?  Uh, I just want to say that if Tom Brokaw wants to beat Dan Rather in the ratings, 
[00:43:00]  he should take a shower in AIDS.  Hey, that's a good idea.  I think I'm going to go down to the hip ward at my local hospital  and do a team act with one of the patients, razor blade juggling.  How about that for a rating?  Who was that on the phone?  Was that the voice?  That wasn't funny.  Tom Brokaw, NBC. 
[00:43:30]  Bing Nightly.  Bing News.  All right.  Jay, what's going on?  Tom Brokaw is God.  We love Tom Brokaw.  Oh, excuse me.  I'm sorry.  Say that S-word.  Hey, hey, hey.  That was hilarious.  That was the funniest bit of radio I've heard in...  All right, Jay.  Dang long time.  And people are drinking at the Opie and Anthony drinking game  because Opie doing the Dan Rather.  I did it.  I think I did a great job as Dan Rather.  And people that are playing the Opie and Anthony drinking game hammered now. 
[00:44:00]  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  That rocked.  I'll tell you, my eyes were closed.  I thought Dan really called.  You thought he was sitting right here.  You're not joshing me, are you?  I'm just ribbing.  By the way, this just in O.J. Not Guilty.  Great.  Not Guilty for O.J.  I got to be honest.  O.J. Not Guilty?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's great.

Are they going to do the Boobalander contest, the girls from Double D's?  I'm in.  Nice.  They work at a place called Double D's?  Yeah.  I'm not seeing the Double D's.  What?  What?  I'm seeing Double B's.  Double A's.  I think it's...  Double B's and a half.  It's supposed to be very...  Oh, no.  All right.  We'll see what they're about next, okay?  All right.  How old are you?

[00:46:00]  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.J., not guilty.  How'd that happen?  Again.  No, no.  I didn't do nothing.  Not guilty in his road rage trial.  It's got to be out of bed.  I love O.J.  You love the O.J.?  Yeah, I really do.  That's a classic.  Well, this guy was saying that a little altercation on the road, 
[00:46:30]  and O.J. at some point grabbed the guy's sunglasses off his face,  scratched them,  and they actually had fingerprints on the sunglasses,  so O.J. had the guy's sunglasses in his hand at some point.  I don't know wherever sunglasses are involved, O.J. gets in trouble.  Whether I'm grabbing them off their face  or slitting the throat of the guy bringing them back to my girl,  I just don't get it.  I don't understand it.  I always get in trouble with the sunglasses. 
[00:47:00]  So then he had this trial.  Some of the testimony is pretty funny.  The prosecutors were saying at some point his kids were yelling,  no, daddy, no, daddy.  And I just thought they left out the not again part.  No, daddy, not again.  No, come on.  No, no, no.  No, daddy.  A lot of us have paid good money to hear that.  No, daddy.  And then people are saying, yeah, he could face 16 years in prison. 
[00:47:30]  The guy killed two people.  He didn't serve a time in prison.  So stop it.  And now they're saying he got on.  Not guilty.  Good boy.  Let's hear some O.J. audio.  O.J.  He was never in his vehicle.  I have been, a lot of things have happened to me the last five years.  People, guns and stuff.  That I would never run to a guy's vehicle, not seeing his hands and not seeing what he has in his lap. 
[00:48:00]  What?  A lot of things have happened to Pedro Guerrero and his cocaine.  No, no, no.  All right, well, Chloe wants to say hi.  From Fight Club, she's outside the studio.  Oh, my God.  Patty's here.  Real fast.  I know.  A lot of people are rolling their eyes like, oh, well, come on, man.  We shaved her head yesterday.  People hate us because we did it.  Some people are saying she looks like, what's her name, the younger brother from American History X. 
[00:48:30]  You look great, Patty.  Oh, my God, Patty.  Thank you.  Patty, what's happening to your lower half?  What do you mean?  You're starting to look like a pear.  Yeah, you're really, are you getting, are you gaining weight?  Well, I.  Is it all that good eating?  No.  It's the Godiva chocolate, isn't it?  No.  You're eating Godiva chocolate.  Be careful with those headphones.  It's moving your wig around.  It looks good in a bun, though. 
[00:49:00]  That's perfect.  Yeah.  That's great.  No.  You look like a younger version of Norman Bates' mom.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  Norman Bates.  Mrs. Bates.  The younger version.  Yeah, your ass.  Like, did you ever watch the Century X video with the old lady having sex?  I saw 15 seconds of it during a recent road show.  Did you see her body?  Kind of like you're.  Not too much of it.  You're kind of like everything's sinking down to the pelvis area. 
[00:49:30]  No.  My stomach usually sticks out when I finish that.  No, that's not what he's talking about, though.  The whole bottom half.  It's like everything there.  You're getting that bunt, and you're, you're, she's got, she's got a pear shape to her.  Yeah.  You're going from bad to heinous.  Really?  Like you're melting a little bit.  Well, Patty, your pictures are up on opandanthony.com.  I know.  I saw them.  When did you stop wearing bras, by the way?  Yeah, are you brawless?  Sheesh.  When I was 18 years old, and they didn't fit right because I wasn't big. 
[00:50:00]  You're kind of like you.  And all I could wear was made and warm.  Something's popping out over there.  Usually that's hot.  Yeah, you got like nip going on, it's, they're horrible.  It's not even because they're sticking out, it's just because you kind of slump in them  and the nipple has nowhere else to go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, look, she's like slumping and she's slouched and melting.  Well, take up jogging, how's that?  Well, as long as you just do it in one direction forever.  Can you take the wig off for us?  Come on.  I haven't laughed in about eight hours. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, take that wig off.  I've been laughing all night long.  Let's see.  The pictures are up on opandanthony.com.  They call it foundrymusic.com, the pictures of us shooting Patty's head for you two tickets.  All right.  Got your entertainment.  You look like one of those little kids with old people disease.  Very funny.  Well, I'm hoping to go to Disneyland with my family.  They've got that wacky voice.  And, uh, no, I'm just, I want everybody to know I'm just a normal kid. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, God.  I just happen to look like I'm 120,000 years old.  I like skateboarding.  I do all the normal things the kids do.  I go skateboarding.  And I'm hoping to make a wish foundation is going to take me to Disney.  And I enjoy my friends and family.  And I'm going to die in about three hours.  What a horrible f***ing disease this is.  I'm a kid, but I can curse.  Look at what I look like.  Oh, we are quite... 
[00:51:30]  I found a girl with the same disease as you.  Her name is Patty.  Hey, get Colin in here.  Colin loves on the phone.  Oh, great, Colin.  Come here.  Hey, Colin, check this out.  Colin Quinn, everyone.  Grab that mic, pal.  Colin Quinn?  Yes, Patty.  Look at her.  Oh, she's breathing.  Did you just wet yourself, Patty?  No.  No, she imprinted now, so I'm going to get stabbed and stalked on 56.  I need to re-autographed before I go. 
[00:52:00]  Well, no problem.  As long as we just keep the boundaries and that's it.  She's an autograph.  Colin?  Colin?  Yes?  We have to be serious.  Patty here, big fan of the show, and she has cancer.  Oh, Jesus.  So she came in as part of the Make-A-Wish program.  Yeah.  So if you would be a little nicer.  Of course.  She wishes she had shoulders and sex appeal.  Matter of fact, Patty, why don't you show Colin...  Colin, what did you want to say?  Yeah, why don't you put that...  Take that off.  Take the wig off.  Take it off your head.  Look at, look at...  Well, you've heard of Sinead O'Connor? 
[00:52:30]  Yes, I have.  I mean, I don't know if she does, but...  Oh!  You look very good, actually, in that.  That's better than...  She blasted me, at least.  I'm afraid you're going to...  Yeah.  It looks good.  You look good.  Isn't that something?  For Vanessa Redgrave.  Yeah, yeah.  We said that yesterday.  Very good, Colin.  Yeah.  She's one of the great beauties.  All right.  Colin, that, of course.  And Frank.  After the diary, of course.  That's Stalker Patty, and we shaved her head for you two tickets yesterday. 
[00:53:00]  Actually, she's eight years old, but as Norton said, she has that disease that makes the  little kids look real old.  If anyone should know.  I believe he has that disease, too.  But she's going to go through her 20s next week.  Well, my parents realized...  I wish I could.  My parents realized when I was three that something wasn't quite right.  But I still do all the things that kids do.  I go to school.  I bicycle and skateboard.  And I know that I'm going to drop dead in a week.  I play video games. 
[00:53:30]  I love video games.  I'd like you to lend that wig to Lady Di, because I'm still getting over that Dennis  DeYoung Lady Di hair.  The blonde Dennis DeYoung.  Yeah.  Wow.  Isn't that great, Dennis DeYoung?  That's Marion.  Oh, that's Marion.  That's Marion.  Don't get him jealous.  He'll call up.  Get your retard straight, Colin.  All right, Patty.  Well, thanks for coming in.  The hair is...  What?  Patty, you've got to...  If you're going to want to straighten it out. 
[00:54:00]  You've got to straighten out your wig, man.  You shouldn't see any 5 o'clock shadow coming out from under the front of your wig.  You know, pull the front down a little bit.  You're going to U2 tonight, right?  Yeah.  Are you helping us see the edge?  Colin, what do you think, man?  Come on.  Help us here.  As far as...  Let's talk about U2.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll find out how liberal Bono really is when you show up in the dressing room after  the show.  Get her out of here.  Get that freak out of here.  Looks like a football helmet in 1908. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know.  I don't think I'll actually meet you.  I think like...  You said Anthony Perkins.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We said it yesterday.  When you pull that wig and a ponytail, it looks like when you do that retarded sumo  wrestling suit, it's the helmet they give you.  It's got the wig on it, and it's supposed to look like the sumo wrestler.  You should just go with the shirt.  Ted, the Irish guy, go for that look.  Yeah.  You said it yourself, Sinead.  Yeah, see?  You could be like Sinead.  She's pretty, though.  No, you're pretty, Patty.  Pretty inside.  Right.  Yeah, it was my dream to go see Bono, and you, too, and tonight I'm going to fulfill 
[00:55:00]  that dream before I drop dead in about 16 hours.  If you wear that wig, six security guys are going to have you spread-eagled on the floor.  Oh, hell yeah.  He walks to your head in about 10 seconds.  It's got to be anthrax under that thing.  And she looks like she's been suffering from it.  Do you have any respiratory difficulties, Patty?  That wig has spores.  Spores flying off of him.  I can see them, for God's sake.  And all the women we've won over, they're long gone after this Patty shaving-up-the-head thing. 
[00:55:30]  They hate us.  Patty, where'd you get that wig?  Did you buy one of those life-size Barbies at Toys R Us, and it came with a wig?  Somebody brought a wig.  A plastic wig.  One of our listeners, they spent five bucks for that thing.  I think it's a Marion safety hat at the brewery.  That's Lady Di.  I'm sorry.  Get your retard on it.  It is hard to.  Well, we'll see you at U2.  Really?  Tonight, Patty.  Okay.  Of course, you're sitting away from us. 
[00:56:00]  But hopefully, you'll enjoy the show, and you can show off your new look.  You know what gives away that it's a wig is the fact that the glasses go under it.  It's not a winter hat.  Well, I always put my hair in my hair.  It's like a hat.  It is.  It's like a cap, like a wool cap.  Patty, turn around.  Let me see you at the back of it.  I mean, I didn't fix it right just now.  And she put a little, you put a cute little flowery thing in the back of it?  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  That's good.  It looks like a hair helmet.  That's good.  It is a very natural hairline.  Yeah.  It's perfect if you're churning butter.  That's great.  All right, Patty.  She's got Mexican hair.  Yeah, it is.  It's Mexican hair.  You know how they get the hairline that starts at the eyebrows?  Stalker Guadalupe.  The landscaper.  It was that you dyed it too dark.  Why did you get it too dark?  Wait, what?  People have been commenting about your new hair today?  Yeah, like it was too dark.  I was like, well, I decided... 
[00:57:00]  No, Patty, they said, I wish you'd die before dark.  No, I didn't say that.  Conor, we're going to play Russian Roulette with Patty.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  She'll do anything.  She'll do anything.  Yeah.  She shaved her head, and last time for YouTube tickets, she let Ron Jeremy take his big porno  hand, hand, and put it down in the pan.  It's fabulous.  She's a 45-year-old virgin.  That antiseptic hand of Ron Jeremy.  Yeah, you know it's got to be sterile. 
[00:57:30]  You know, she is a 45-year-old virgin.  She's never had sex with anybody.  Really?  I mean, nothing.  She's waiting for the right person.  Was it a moral decision, or just one of those unhappy actions?  It's a moral decision on my part.  Really?  And thank God God agreed when he gave you your attributes.  I'm going to be with somebody for a real, real, real, long, long, long time.  That's not what it's about.  Patty, it's not what it's about, especially when you were younger.  Like, the days of just F-ing for fun and stuff.  That's what you have for fun. 
[00:58:00]  That's what you have for fun.  But that's why people are dying of AIDS.  No, not you.  She's got a point.  I'm looking for my luck.  She doesn't have a luck.  So you what, you just went for the look of dying of AIDS?  No.  Instead of having the actual, the personality of someone dying of AIDS.  Oh, my God.  Patty, you're prime passed you by, and now you're sitting there with, you know, cobwebs growing down there.  You put such a value on it back in the day, but, you know, the vag devalues over time. 
[00:58:30]  The whole neighborhood is falling apart.  Right.  It loses its value.  I don't think so.  I do.  It's true.  There's nothing more erotic than a sparsely gray hair, dog.  Yeah, than a few of those gnarly grays that are just, and a withered, uh...  It's going to respect me more.  Nothing works best on loose skin than gravity, too.  You know what I mean?  Where it just takes, gravity takes its ugly hold and pulls down like Turkish taffy on a summer's day. 
[00:59:00]  Eric, what's going on?  What's up, Owen?  Hey, listen.  Hey.  I was looking out on the website at some of the pics of Stalker Patty.  Everybody checking out the Stalker Patty pics on opianthony.com.  Go ahead.  There's one with the mohawk.  She looks like Robert De Niro at Taxi Driver.  Yeah.  Someone made a poster of that picture.  Yeah.  Yeah, and if you could just do a few lines from the movie at Stalker Patty, forget about it.  Let me put my tape on.  I'll talk to you guys later.  All right.  Thanks, Art.  Are you talking to me?  Are you talking to me? 
[00:59:30]  Well, I don't see anyone else here.  All right, Patty.  Well, you're looking good.  Thank you.  You're going to have to loosen up the wig a little bit, though.  I'll go in the bathroom.  You drive uptown, Bronx, anytime, anywhere.  She's the only wig that comes with a chin strap.  Harlem, anytime, anywhere.  She's got Scott and Herman hair, Anthony.  Our old GM.  Yeah.  That's great.  All right. 
[01:00:00]  That looks cute.  Yeah, Colin, yesterday when we were shaving her head, the first thing we gave her was the mullet.  Oh.  We shaved her head into the mullet.  Made her look just like Geddy Lee.  Geddy Lee or Joe Dirt, whatever.  Insert mullet-headed person here.  Then we gave her the Mr. T.  I pity the fool.  Cuts off my mullet.  And then we just shaved it all off like the, you know, last train of Auschwitz kind of look that she's sporting now.  I think it looks good, though, Patty.  Well, thank you.  If you're in someone's way at the U2 show, remember, remove your hair. 
[01:00:30]  I like that fringe shirt.  It's a nice little fringe top you got there.  Isn't that nice?  It's kind of groovy.  Yes.  Kind of a retro thing she's working on.  Yeah, it is retro with the hair and everything.  It's true.  You look like Barby Benton, 1968.  Oh, jeez.  Barby Benton.  Let's invite the hot chicks in now.  Ah, can we do that?  Yeah, we got some hot chicks.  These are the girls from Double D's, and they'll be helping us out.  The first contestants in our Google Lantern contest.  There goes single A's. 
[01:01:00]  They were trading single A's for Double D.  How great would that wig look just getting punched off?  Drunken black fist.  By Bono in a drunken black house.  Boy Patty's in the corner.  I know, it's, well, somehow it fits.  Yeah.  Were you the wallflower at the high school dances?  But it was quiet.  Yeah, you were quieter, right?  The wall weed.  If we tell her to go stay in the corner, she goes and stands in the corner. 
[01:01:30]  There's something to be said for that kind of Eastern submission of women.  Well, I'm nine years old, but I look like I'm 95.  But I live a normal life just like a kid.  I go to the dances, and I stand in the corner because kids, quite frankly, are afraid of me.  I look something like a Martian.  Oh, without the cool thing, like the ability to fly through space.  I just look like a freak.  Thank God for this wig.  Ag, ag, ag.  Ag, ag, ag, ag.  She looks like the reason the Taliban lock women in the house. 
[01:02:00]  My family, the Bakerish Foundation, is taking me to Disney.  I can't wait to, um, I went once before when they thought I was dying,  and my family threw me off during Pirates of the Caribbean thinking no one would find me.  And in It's a Small World where, well, I kind of look like the little kid.  I got a full night, back soon, like I, I, free air, awesome.  Chang, chang, bang, chang, bang.  Same song. 
[01:02:30]  Same annoying song.  I can't, free.  You kind of look like the, uh, It's a Small World, kids.  You just change their hair.  Oh, this just, put the chap in the later hose, and now you're floating for Germany.  This just, then, Rick is in the closet with the hot chicks.  He's getting their, he's making, he's getting their pictures taken, so.  Is that it?  Now he's running down the hall.  Wow.  He's a married man.  Yeah.  He's walking down the hall completely topless.  Oh, really?  Look at this.  Look at Patty just in the corner, cowering. 
[01:03:00]  Nice.  Rick, did they come out nice?  Wow, look at you.  Hey.  Wow.  Those, wait a minute.  Shaking my boobies.  Those are implants.  Those are implants, huh?  Yeah.  They look really good.  Thank you.  They look really, you must have paid top dollar for that.  I sure did.  Oh, my God.  That is great.  And I shake my boobies.  Great.  You do, do you?  I shake my boobies at double e's.  And where's double e's?  In Morristown.  Morristown, of course.  Yeah.  You're doing a benefit tonight, Anthony, right?  A benefit.  Yep.  What is the benefit? 
[01:03:30]  Why don't you come down and see?  Now, if Patty said that, we'd slap her and throw her downstairs, right?  What is it for?  What's the benefit for?  You guys don't know, do you?  We do.  It's for Vito's auto salvage.  It's for the disaster fund.  Half the day's registered receipts are going to go to the disaster fund for the families  that suffered everything with the World Trade Center. 
[01:04:00]  Patty's head, the disaster fund.  What do you guys think of Patty?  You like Patty?  What do you guys think of Patty?  Her head's shaved.  Yeah.  I was in the corner over here.  Why is she in the corner?  We told her to go in the corner.  We told her to stay in the corner.  No, I don't want her to go in the corner.  Oh, no.  This is like Patty in a corner.  Why would you shave her hair?  Why did you do that?  Patty, get in the corner.  You're sea blocking us.  Oh, you're mean.  This is like one of those bad 80s movies where they're chilly.  They call her in and then they drop blood on her in the prom. 
[01:04:30]  Exactly.  Plug it up.  Plug it up.  Wait, she feels bad.  What's wrong?  Naked chick?  Her hair.  That looks great.  I bet you couldn't even tell that was a wig.  Right?  Take off.  She goes well.  What?  Why did you do that to her, though?  What?  She got tickets.  For U2 tickets.  She wanted to go see U2.  What?  She just looks at Colin.  She's like, oh, my God.  That's Colin Quinn.  Yeah, Colin Quinn.  He's like our best friend.  We go out with him and stuff and pick up chicks. 
[01:05:00]  He gives us great races, great horse tips.  Yes, I get bad horse tips out of one of his houses.  One of his horses has ever come in.  Hey, that one came in.  One came in.  The one came in.  Okay.  My cousin stinks.  Dylan Murphy, if you ever want to beat him up.  Hey, Patty, take off your wig to show the girls what happened.  There you go.  Look at this.  She don't have to be like on it.  No, guys.  She loves it.  Lady, talk into the mic.  It looks good off.  It looks better off.  I like it better off.  So do I.  Right.  And Bono would like it better off, too.  Bono's going to love your hair.  Go ahead, Patty. 
[01:05:30]  Here we go.  I love him.  Listen to this reaction.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It looks good.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  That's terrible.  American History Act.  Yes.  American History Act.  You lose my mind.  Chloe from Fight Club.  You don't pay me enough to shave my head like that.  Well, we would never ask.  Yeah.  We would never ask you ladies to shave your head.  Right.  Would you ask me?  We would never ask you ladies to shave your head.  Doesn't it look like some guy in jackboots should just be giving her the thumbs down as  she steps by him?  You know, she wouldn't even make it into the gates of us. 
[01:06:00]  No.  Don't stop this one.  This one cannot possibly work.  She'll be like, Albert, Mark, what?  Direct to experimentation.  Oh, my God.  So, did you get all the pictures of these ladies for the Boobalander content?  Not yet.  We're still working on Laura.  Let's see.  Working on Laura.  Those are good.  Why did the other two decide they didn't want to come in completely topless?  Well, she was getting her pictures done.  Oh, is that it?  So, then they're like, oh, they want to talk to you.  We're running.  You know, these ladies. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  If you girls are a little indication of what goes down in double D's.  That's nice.  I like it.  That's beautiful.  You want to know what goes down there?  You really want to know.  Well, you know, my parents are taking me down to double D's.  I was part of my Make-A-Wish Foundation.  Oh, my gosh.  I'm only eight years old, but I have that aging disease where I look 95.  I like riding bikes.  I like skateboarding.  And I like those nice and big. 
[01:07:00]  And I like to them.  Oh, God.  Oh, you're turning me on.  Wow.  Oh, hey.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  I don't care what happened to your day.  Oh, my God.  Look at the ladies there.  One's dressed in red.  One's in white.  One's in blue.  Oh, patriotic.  Are you like that?  Nick, now.  We are Bush's girls.  Okay.  Terrific.  Insert your own joke here.  Bush's girls.  They call it single entendre. 
[01:07:30]  We're with, you know, Bush's angels.  Yeah.  You're Bush's angels.  Yes.  We're his angels.  Oh, George W. Bush.  Not Charlie.  Right, right.  Ah.  George's angels.  Look at that.  They're pushing them against each other.  Bush's at Double D's.  Right.  In Morristown.  Yes.  You guys all got lovely implants.  Look at that.  Aren't they great jobs?  Oh, look at that.  Those girls do such good jobs, Ann.  Ooh, her shakes really good.  Mine don't.  Look at that.  They're just bouncing up and down. 
[01:08:00]  They're shaking.  Patty's folding her arms in the closet.  Oh, Patty.  What's the matter?  Patty, get next to the girls and flash and jiggle.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  You're like one of the girls.  You got to take your wig off, though.  Take your wig off.  Take your wig off.  Take your wig off.  Take your wig off.  Take your wig off.  Take your wig off.  Take your wig off.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  All right.  And now take your shirt off.  Take your shirt off.  There you go, Patty.  Give a little jiggle with the other girls.  One of these things is not like the other.  One of these things is not the same. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Take it off and jiggle around with the ladies.  Jiggle around.  Yeah, she can do that.  There we go.  Come on, Patty.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Patty.  She looks like a fleshy daisy stem.  That is 100% natural.  Oh, yeah.  No doubt about that.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, Parker.  Only God would create such a...  This abomination.  I love my bad.  Well, you've got to take the bad with the good.  Yeah.  We're going to go.  Yin and yang. 
[01:09:00]  Right, party.  We're taking a lot of pictures.  We'll put them up on opiandassay.com.  That's great.  Wow, ladies.  My must say.  Beautiful.  Isn't that fantastic?  I'll make sure when it comes down the next day, it's a double D.  I'll slap for a ton.  It's a horse count.  So, double D's, you spend money.  Half of it goes to a great cause, right?  We're giving away free table dances.  Do you guys do the knee dance?  The knee dance?  The knee.  The knee.  Do you give knee?  She left at her knee.  You know the knee where the guy's sitting?  The guy's sitting down.  They toss some cash. 
[01:09:30]  And then you girls come up and you put your stuff right in his face.  And then your knee gets right at the...  Oh.  Yeah.  And then you kind of rub with the knee a little bit.  Oh, just a little bit?  Yeah.  Oh, well, you know, a lot of bit.  You give us a little bit more credit than that.  Well, my parents were a little shocked when I said my last wish for the Make a Wish Foundation  was to get a knee job by the wonderful double D girls.  But then when my father saw the girls, he said, well, holy s***.  I, uh, I'll take you down there. 
[01:10:00]  We'll stay all day.  Uh, f*** mom.  We'll leave her at home.  Screw Disney, right?  Right.  Screw Disney.  Who needs Disney when you can go to Double D's for your last night?  Who needs the haunted mansion when I got f*** all in my face?  Red hot f*** Z.  Thank you, my babies.  Wow, ladies, you're beautiful.  Very nice.  So you're going to come?  See us?  See you.  See you.  Well, C-O-M-A, yes.  Yeah, sure.  Yes, we will arrive.  You girls, uh, you, you, you drink it all down there at the club? 
[01:10:30]  This girl hasn't slept, you can tell.  Oh, you have no idea.  She made, um, doll.  What?  She made this Summer Bin Laden doll last night and she wanted to bring it in here.  She, like, stabbed it and put blood on it.  Yeah?  Crazy.  Could you imagine if Patty was telling this story, how quickly we'd punch her in the face?  No, it's not Double D's right now.  I'm probably going there.  I stabbed it, I put blood all over it.  Oh, yeah?  So you go to Double D's, you get to see the Bin Laden doll. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  I went to, you know, school for the theater.  Sure.  Oh, so you made, you did a little act.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  And were you naked?  All night long.  Beautiful.  Sabinette sucker.  Kind of like a one-woman show.  I stuffed them and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Party City and I picked up the head, it looks just like them.  I put it all over his face.  Oh, really?  I was a wizard, but now it is Bin Laden, please believe me when I tell you.  Could you make a Jim Norton doll and tinkle on it?  No, not yet, but, oh.  Well, the golden shower has always been a dream of mine. 
[01:11:30]  I'm hoping the Make-A-Wish Foundation gets a girl that can drink a lot of water  and give me a little of the yellow discipline that I need so greatly  as a child of nine that looks like I'm 95 years old.  I got the, we call it now the Jerry Springer disease  because he likes to parade us out on the stage.  But it's a disease that makes you look like your head has been shaved  and you're going to a U2 concert with retro clothes.  Where does this guy come from? 
[01:12:00]  Could you please tell me?  Wow, these ladies are fine.  You don't understand, though.  All right.  We're going to auction this doll.  Oh, the doll.  And we're going to send the money to a good club.  Yes, we know that.  You know, but I was up all night with this thing.  I was afraid if I fell asleep that I wouldn't wake up.  Very nice.  I have a nice, oh.  Let's see the rest of the package there.  Let me see.  Oh, wow.  Look at that, huh?  You like my team?  What do you think, Norton?  Phenomenal.  Yeah, you guys are, there's nothing wrong with anything.  Phenomenal.  You're like this.  Not like this. 
[01:12:30]  Like this.  Oh, my God.  I think I would finish if I had that.  You drink coffee all night, you become like this.  Hepatitis spill, aisle three.  That's great, right, Norton?  From behind with the reach around, right?  Yeah.  Ample sounds happening.  I'm a Heidi freak.  I see that.  You're freaking out.  Yeah.  Pull on this.  Toot, toot, toot.  It's a crotch list, you know.  Oh, it is.  Yeah, we can tell.  Can't see. 
[01:13:00]  Patty, you got a number like that at home?  What?  You got something like that at home?  Ladies, can't...  Okay.  You like that?  Yeah, we usually like that along.  You got a little number like that at home, the crotch list thing?  Can Patty put some of your clothes on, ladies?  Oh, my God.  Absolutely.  Want my clothes?  I love them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get Patty to dress in the Dumb and D girls.  Hey, Rick, this is the picture.  This is the photo op.  You got to get a picture of her wearing the outfit.  You got to put it back on.  And then you got to give it to Patty.  Patty will go in the bathroom.  She'll put on the same outfit and we'll have the pictures side by side on opianthony.com. 
[01:13:30]  When I said I wanted to be an exotic dancer, I'm only nine, so it turned a few heads, but  I think I look good when my shaved head, no breasts, no ass, hair shape, I dressed in  exotic dancer clothes.  Oh, my God.  And I don't have to suffer the indignity too long because I'm dying in my six hours.  Where are you from?  My age accelerates one year every two minutes.  You just went through your 80s in the last 15 minutes.  This is, yeah.  During the time I've been speaking, I went through my entire 80th years on this planet. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  Get a little picture of her before she passes out.  Patty has the hips of a Komodo dragon.  All right.  We got to take a break.  The ladies are going to get their pictures taken for the Boovalantern contest, Anthony.  Yeah.  They're from Double D's in Morristown.  They're doing that great benefit tonight.  Wait.  You're taking a picture of her in it first, and then Patty.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  It's going to be, oh, my God.  This will be the funniest picture you've ever seen.  Nice.  I'm sure Patty will look nice. 
[01:14:30]  That's beautiful.  Hey, oh, boy.  Good God.  All right.  Well, we're distracting.  That could be the nicest Patty I've ever seen.  Yeah, it's not the weight.  110 pounds can look good if it's distributed into all the right areas.  Hey, good news.  Boovalantern contest is on.  Nice.  Game on.  We got our first three contestants, and I'm hearing more ladies.  He's on the way down to the studio today.  Rock.  We're going to have to take a quick break.  Colin Quinn in the studio.  He's playing Carolines.  Tonight, Colin?  He don't care.  He's not.  No, tomorrow.  Not tonight.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow night? 
[01:15:00]  Hey.  Got a lap full of fun there.  How are you doing?  Tomorrow night, Colin Quinn, 930 at Carolines in New York City.  All the news you need to know and proves.  This is W.O.W., the Wow Radio Station.  Anthony, Hotwire.  Yeah, Hotwire.  It's the website that gets you better deals on travel.

What a day for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Ah, yes. 
[01:16:30]  We have a wild party in the studio today.  We've got the fine ladies from Double D's in the studio.  Double D's in Morristown.  They're doing a benefit tonight.  Yeah.  Half the money that they take in tonight will go to a great cause.  Mm-hmm.  One of the World Trade Center benefits.  Yep.  Or charities, I should say.  Right.  Okay.  Look at Colin just having a blast.  He's got naked girls around him.  Laura is completely naked.  She came in here in this really hot, white, see-through, jumpsuit number thing.  Yep.  And frilly and see-through and nice, right? 
[01:17:00]  I didn't even know she was naked if you said that.  Nice.  And you know something?  When they made that outfit, they were thinking about a girl just like you to put it on.  Because it's perfect, right?  But now, who's wearing that outfit?  I'm distracted because more girls have shown up.  It looks like for the Booble Lantern Contest or something else.  Maybe something else.  I don't know.  Anyway.  What did you say, Anthony? 
[01:17:30]  Yes.  So, that's who should be wearing something like that.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  But who has it on now?  Patty.  Stalker Patty.  We'll have that same hot, sexy outfit on.  And she's making her way into the studio.  Here she comes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  With the wig on.  Patty, back up to the CD rack so he can see you.  She looks like the pilot from 2001. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, my God.  That is, uh, wow.  She does look like that.  All right, Patty, turn around.  Let me see.  Let me see the back.  All right.  You know what?  The dumper doesn't look that bad.  I don't care what anybody says.  Let me see.  It's not bad.  It's not.  No, she's got a nice butt.  That's cute.  She's got a nice butt.  She's cute.  It takes a lot of balls to do that.  Frills cover up a world of hurt.  She's got my outfit on.  And, uh, it looks better than I thought it would.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  Well, why don't we take the wig off? 
[01:18:30]  Just to, you know.  Yeah, take the wig off.  Take the wig off.  Take the wig off.  Take the wig off.  It goes to the booth.  Ah, there you go.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  All right, Rick, that's the picture you need to take.  Hello, little Alex.  I'm like a boy.  She looks like a boy.  I'm like a clockwork idiot.  Going out with me droogies.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Wow.  Ooh.  Yeah, okay.  All right. 
[01:19:00]  Well, I'll still say the same thing about the dumpster.  Rick is taking our pictures, and we'll put them side by side with Laura wearing the same  outfit, Anthony.  That's great.  How long was her hair?  Isn't that your vision of the post-apocalyptic Earth?  Like, that's my vision of what we have to deal with.  It's like the SS bachelor party where they start to get...  Heinrich's spatula party.  She's on her way to help the resistance.  Do you like the outfit, Patty? 
[01:19:30]  I like the outfit.  Oh, yeah?  You look really good.  You do.  Oh, Patty, you got to fix that wig off.  I know.  Yeah.  I can't fix it.  It looks so good.  No, Patty, but you got to pull the front down.  It's not a Yankee hat.  I know.  I can't take this anymore.  Do you do now?  Well, I don't get a mail job.  They're trading beauty tips.  Restaurant job.  It's not practical.  Restaurant.  Ladies, you think Patty has potential for double these? 
[01:20:00]  As a shot girl.  As a shot girl?  I thought she said a shock girl.  The shock's the hell out of you that you walked into the post.  It's time for the last call.  They sit around.  That way there's no argument from the guys.  She can bartend.  She can bartend.  She can bartend.  Definitely bartend.  Patty, do you dance at all?  Definitely.  Can you dance?  I was in college, and my natural father was a flamenco dancer in the 30s.  Wow.  Your natural father.  There's some baggage there that I don't even want to open.  Now, was it the natural? 
[01:20:30]  Just check it and put it on the plane.  Oh, no.  Was it the natural father that touched you, or was it somebody else?  The what?  I think that was the opening line in the book by Selena Stalker.  My natural father was a flamenco dancer in the 30s.  Sounds like an SNL ticket gone bad.  Will Ferrell as the 30s flamenco dancer.  His name was Rico.  He was a dancer.  So, Patty, you think you could shake one out? 
[01:21:00]  Can we, like, do that later?  No, you know what?  How about we just never do it?  All right.  The naked girl's talking, and everyone wants to listen.  What is your fetish?  Booty?  Ass.  You don't, no, his fetish is beyond anything you ladies have even heard about.  Oh, wait, you're the one, like, you like, you like Gary?  Oh, look at what she's doing now.  Wow.  Look at that chain.  Nice.  She just did a little jiggle there for Norton.  Thank you.  A little booty.  A little booty.  He likes that.  We've seen him take ice cubes. 
[01:21:30]  There was a girl kneeling on a couch in here, and he took ice cubes and just made them disappear.  And then they came flying back out right into his mouth.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  I was putting them in and one James down.  I just threw it in.  Chicken, not stirred.  Chicken, not stirred.  Ben-nova.  Well, if you come see us at Double D's, we won't treat you like that.  That was a good plug.  It'll be really nice.  Yeah, there you go.  No, he wants to be treated like that, do you?  Yeah, he does.  He really is.  He likes being degraded.  Who's the horrified lady outside the studio? 
[01:22:00]  Okay.  I can arrange that.  The tall one?  Yeah, the real hot one.  But she looks horrified.  Yeah, that's the host of Change of Heart.  Change of Heart.  Oh, Change of Heart.  Change of Heart.  There you go.  Hey, let's bring her in here.  Aw.  Let's get her in here.  It should take two minutes.  Can she hook me up?  Maybe.  Maybe she can hook me up for somebody?  Yeah, I guess they changed the host.  I have no luck.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, hi.  Oh, hey, how are you?  How are you?  Good.  I didn't know you were hosting that show.  Hey, wait a minute.  Wait, Norton, you know her? 
[01:22:30]  Lynn Coppola.  Yeah, she's a friend of mine.  Really?  Yeah.  You know Norton?  Wait.  Do you know your breath?  Wait, you know Norton?  Yeah.  How the hell do you know her?  Norton doesn't know a good-looking lady.  I really like her now.  She's a friend of mine.  She's a friend of mine.  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, hi.  Jesus Christ, Norton.  He never ceases to amaze me.  How do you know her?  She's a friend of mine for a long time.  From where?  She would never go out with me, but she's a friend of mine.  Oh, okay.  You guys are good?  I said I would never go out with me.  She's a good comic.  She's funny.  Would you go out with Norton?  Well, not now.  I'm dating somebody, but I wonder if he'd ask me out. 
[01:23:00]  He never asked me out.  You could go on your own show.  Yeah, you're right.  Go on a date with Norton.  Talk about it in front of your boyfriend.  This is a weird scene.  We got naked girls.  We got, what's your name?  Lynn.  Lynn from what show?  Change of Heart.  Change of Heart.  And Colin Quinn.  Did you even know I was coming?  What the hell?  Yeah, we read a little bit about you.  And that's stalker Patty.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  You look better with your hair on.  You look cute, though.  You like it with the hair on or off?  I saw the hair off.  The off is different, but I like it on.  I think it's futuristic. 
[01:23:30]  Like she should be wearing a Mylar suit.  Flying in some state ship somewhere.  With the lace outfit, I like the hair on.  Definitely.  Yeah.  All right.  And, of course, that's Colin Quinn from SNL.  Hi.  Hi, Lynn.  And other things.  I'm looking for you tomorrow.  You're a Caroline's farmer.  Oh, beautiful.  Wow.  Nice.  Soccer list.  Best use of a plug ever.  Yeah, Colin Quinn will be at Caroline's tomorrow night at 930.  Yes.  Yeah, I did that.  Put that right in there.  That was beautiful.  Thank you.  I love that.  So, what happened to the guy that used to host that show?  Jagger. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, the cutie.  Where did he go?  I can't.  Uh-uh.  Ah!  It's a hard one.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  I'm playing.  I'm playing.  He is cute, actually.  No, he's a DJ in Dallas.  Yeah.  He just went back to doing that, because they brought the show here.  And they just made a conversation.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, okay.  I got you.  Anything else change about the show, though?  Because I watched that show.  I watched it late at night.  I like the whole setup.  It's a couple, and for some reason, they decide that they're going to go out with other people  and then come back on the show and rub it in the face of their significant other, which 
[01:24:30]  I love that kind of conflict thing.  That's nice.  It's right when they're, like, deciding if they're going to stay together or have a change  of heart.  Yeah, and instead of sitting and talking it out, they screw each other over.  They go out with their dream date.  Because it's always the same thing.  Like, they sit there, and the woman will go out with the guy, and then they bring the  guy out, and they give the nasty looks to each other, the boyfriend and the guy, and  then the chick will put her arm around him, and we'll make all these sexual innuendos. 
[01:25:00]  But you know what's new now that is so fun is we now have date cams.  Ah, good.  So we send the, like, stalker cam out with them on the date.  So now you can see them touching ass and stuff like that.  And what happens is everybody, and we have, like, 50 in the can already, and I would say,  like, 50 in the can.  Nice, Norton, right?  I know.  Thank you.  Aren't I?  I've been in the business for a while, guys.  No.  But, so anyway, so what happens is they come on the show, and, like, I would say 50% of  the couples will say, I was really good on the date.  It was a really innocent date. 
[01:25:30]  And we've got, like, we have one guy with his hand up this girl's skirt, like, up to the elbow.  Nice.  This is, like, on Brooklyn Bridge.  And we had it all on tape.  See, that's good, because you can never tell before on the show what the hell they were  really doing, because I always thought more went on than they fessed up to.  Sure it did.  So you can't get these people out there.  But now they've got the cam to prove it, so.  We actually have a lot of footage that's, like, too hot for TV.  Wow.  And we're going to have to, like, a special show.  I smell video.  Ah.  I smell video release.  Totally.  People find the release forms, and then we send them out on the date.  That's the one you want to see, the girl with the black eye who can't sit. 
[01:26:00]  No, the too hot, the, Norton, some of the too hot for TV ones are really good.  Like, we've got a girl, oh, um, what's happening?  Oh, okay, thanks.  I'm sorry.  I can't really do two things at one time.  No, one of the ones, we had a girl that went with a guy, they'd known each other for  ten minutes, and they got in the limousine.  I can't, I guess, can I talk about this?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Nobody's going to hear it.  It's everybody driving home.  Okay, so, so they get in, they get in the limousine, and there was, like, a strategically 
[01:26:30]  placed can of whipped cream in the limousine.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  And, uh, the girl, next thing I know, she's, like, saying to the guy, we've seen it, it  hasn't aired yet, because we don't know how much we can air, because we haven't been able  to get the girl now to call us back to come on the show.  She was in the couple.  She gets in the limousine with her date, the single.  They've known each other ten minutes.  She finds this can of whipped cream, and she's like, are you hungry?  And I swear to God, the guy goes, I could eat something. 
[01:27:00]  She goes, all right.  She pulls her skirt up to her waist.  Oh, she's got a D-string on, she whips the whipped cream on her pride, and he's like,  well, okay, and he eats the whipped cream, and now we can't get the girl to call us  back.  How great would it be if she was diabetic and slipped into a coma and sang her anyway?  How come I can't get these like that?  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Jim.  You should be a producer on the show.  If you put whipped cream down there, you could walk out on the street, and people would be  having a smorgasbord.  Yeah, you girls are perfect for our show. 
[01:27:30]  You should all come out on the singles.  Oh, I would love to.  The singles.  Come out.  Yeah, come out in front of the girlfriend who's just sitting there all pissed off that  her boyfriend went on a date, and just come out and degrade her.  You don't have what I got, honey.  I like when they do that.  We have that a lot.  We had a girl take her shoe off recently.  Oh, when the shoes start flying?  Yeah.  Well, you know, now that they've moved the show from L.A. to New York, things have changed.  Like, the people are so different.  Yeah.  For real, you mean?  They're much more earthy.  Earthy.  I like that. 
[01:28:00]  I like that.  What time is it on now?  Earthy.  It's on at 1.30 in the morning.  1.30 in the morning.  So, if you're...  You get the same deal we got in syndication.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  1.30 in the morning.  The show's better than that.  It's suited for...  It's suited for late night, though.  She looks like Cindy Crawford.  That's good.  How many people have told you that?  She looks better than Cindy Crawford.  Yeah, well, a young Cindy Crawford.  You know what, though?  I was on Extra last week, and it was so embarrassing, because they said, what celebrity do you get  told you look like, and I'm like, Cindy Crawford, and then, I'm not used to doing all this stuff, 
[01:28:30]  then all of a sudden, we watch the clip, and they're like, and she looks like, and it's  got me going, Cindy Crawford, and then it split screens me and Cindy Crawford, like,  I think I look like Cindy Crawford, and I'm like, oh, great, she's sitting with Randy,  with her husband, going, my ass is not that big.  I do not look like that girl.  That's what I need, and Cindy Crawford calling me, yelling at me.  And the Joy Behar voice, so.  Oh, God.  Come here, I'm going to punch him in the head.  Oh, it's a nice Joy Behar voice.  I'm just kidding. 
[01:29:00]  Is it grating?  Do you find it annoying, my voice?  No, not at all.  It's got a certain neurotic Bobby Fleckman quality to it.  Yeah, you got it, sure.  Nice.  I like that.  Thank you.  Thank you, Colin.  What's wrong, Colin?  You all right?  You know what this show's about by now, don't you?  Well, jeez, the Joy and Helen, usually he has to pay into the tens of dollars for entertainment  like this.  The world's worst time I was on, it was a whole different ballgame.  Right, right.  Wait till you see who's coming in next there, Colin, to join the party. 
[01:29:30]  He already was being harassed by her outside.  Have you ever met Sandy?  Yes, I have.  Me and Sandy used to audition for comedy together.  Online, the cat tries to show you some entertaining.  Open mic.  She's a nutcase.  She's insane.  Well, we have to take a break.  Lynn, you want to stick around?  Sure.  You want to hang out?  It's just going to get crazier.  Yeah, let us walk in now.  It just gets worse from here.  1.30 in the morning, though.  God.  But it's cold.  You're not up at 1.30 in the morning.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, but no, he's not. 
[01:30:00]  No, I'm not, actually.  You're going to bed early?  Yeah.  I'm up.  But the show's better than that.  I do, because it's that late night thing.  I think, I'll tell you, last night, 3.30 in the morning.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, we want to hear.  I want to hear.  Oh, nothing, please.  All right, listen, it's just late.  We're going to take a break.  The girls from Double D's, they're going into the closet to get their boob-a-lantern pictures taken.  Again?  Rick?  I got mine done.  No, she got hers done, but the other two girls need to get their pictures done.  Then we're going to put all the pictures up on opiananthony.com.  Yeah.  Double D's in Morristown.  These girls are doing a benefit tonight. 
[01:30:30]  And you can come back in the studio after you're done with your pictures.  Very pretty girls.  Okay.  At Double D's.  Do you want me to go take some more pictures, too?  Put your clothes back on.  Uh-huh.  No, no.  Put your clothes back on.  No one has to put their clothes back on.  Everyone just say how they are.  Except Patty.  Except Patty.  You can put on a winter coat.  You're comfortable naked.  Yeah, I'll be back.  All right.  We're going to take a break, and we'll figure this out next.  Boom.  Wow.  Boom.  Boom.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I find the most erratic part of a woman.  Here's the boobies. 
[01:31:00]  We're playing that one for stalker Patty.  Because she looks like Marilyn Manson getting ready for a concert.  She does kind of look like Manson.  Yeah.  What a party we have going on today.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's whip them out Wednesday really fast for the new cities, Anthony.  Wow.  Greatest radio promotion ever.  Oh, it's a lot of fun.  A lot of the stations were on there making the WOW bumper stickers, which makes it real easy.  But if you don't have a WOW bumper sticker, you just write WOW on the back of your car or somewhere on your ride. 
[01:31:30]  And if the ladies feel like it, they will flash you on the way home from work.  Yeah, you see the WOW, you get a flash.  Works like a charm here in New York.  Works great in Philly and Boston so far.  Washington, they're printing up WOW stickers.  That should be available very, very soon.  We got the girls from Double D's in the studio.  Yes.  I have bad news.  What?  My boobs didn't light up.  Why?  I don't know.  How did they not light up?  Oh, hold on.  The girls are coming in all bones. 
[01:32:00]  What?  We got a 2020 bag at home to get the shots ready because Patty's coming back home with us to work.  She's going to sell shots.  Are you going to be the shot girl at Double D's?  Look, they tied up her little half shirt.  Get those shots ready because we are bringing Patty home with us.  She looks hot.  I wouldn't take an anthrax shot from her.  I will.  I was going to say, anything could induce shots of alcohol quickly.  All right, hold on.  Give me 12.  All right, hold on.  There's too much going on.  Your boobs didn't light up?  No, my boobs did not light up. 
[01:32:30]  Rick, why not?  I don't know.  We pushed them up there as hard as we could, me and Mary.  Are they real?  No.  No, they're fake.  They're like a year old.  The only thing that lit up was a little bit around the outside.  Oh, your implants are under the muscle.  But so are hers, and hers lit up beautifully.  But Brielle's lit up like jack-o-lantern.  Let's turn off the lights in here and try them again.  Yeah, let's try in here.  Dim the lights.  Get the flashlights.  It doesn't work.  And let's see what the hell the story is here. 
[01:33:00]  I was distracted.  And then the other girl from Double D's is telling us that Starker Patty's going to Morristown tonight to sell shots.  You going to be a shot girl tonight, Patty?  What about the U2 concert?  Yeah, you got the U2 show tonight.  Yeah, she's got to go to the U2 show.  Thank you, Colin.  I'll take Patty's position.  All right, Rick's got the flashlight.  All right, stand over there.  She's got to go to after parties, too, after U2.  Right.  This girl has beautiful boobs.  We could at least have the before shot anyway on the site.  Right, Rick?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now, get the flashlights underneath. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, good enough.  We'll be able to see if there was a problem.  Oh, wow.  They're not lighting up.  What a drag.  That is something.  Yeah, a little bit around the outside.  A little bit around the outside.  Maybe we need some, like, thousand-watt park hands or something.  Well, bring the other girl over.  Do you think saliva would help?  I can't try.  All right, check this out, Ed.  Ooh, good to see.  Yeah, see? 
[01:34:00]  Look at that.  Rick, move out of the way.  Move out of the way.  Wow.  Look at that.  Yours are open muscle, too.  I don't understand.  Wow, yours did not light up at all.  No, it didn't light up like that.  That stinks.  You got, like, it must be a little meteor or something there.  You know what I mean?  Nice.  I don't know what.  Are you all right?  You need a hug or something?  Colin's taking care of that.  Colin's consoling her right now.  She's all foam because her boobs don't light up, Anthony.  Let me massage them.  Colin just, he doesn't care.  Whatever works. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, I'm just going to wear the shirt.  That's so sweet.  What, you wearing that shirt to a U2 tonight, Patty?  That's a bad idea for the club.  Yeah, really.  You're right.  I don't think the club needs that type of advertisement.  Come in and get a cadaver dance.  I think Patty should come on our show.  Yeah?  Change of heart.  Oh, yeah, Lynn.  Change of heart.  I forgot about you.  Change of heart.  Oh, B.  Well, my boobs aren't lighting up right now, so I'm going to forget about me.  If Patty came on, it would be change of sexual preference. 
[01:35:00]  Hey, someone is saying if the implants are old, they will not light up.  But those look brand new.  Yours are brand new.  How old are your boobs?  Nine years old.  My three-year-old.  Whoa, really?  So that blows that right out of the window.  Oh, that ain't true.  I don't know.  I just think because you've got a little more material to work with there.  I don't know.  Mine just feel real, though.  They look very natural, and they, like, flop around nicely.  All right. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, uh, we have to get Sandy Cain in here.  Do we?  Well, what, it's getting too hot in here?  It's too attractive in here with the girls?  I know.  You know something?  I don't accept anything from Sandy Cain.  Mr. Petey.  Oh, the dildo thing.  Oh, my God.  She has pictures of me to put on her show.  Uh-oh.  You have never seen her show?  It's great.  No, what is it?  It's her.  She stands in front of a blue screen or something, and they play video clips of nonsense in the 
[01:36:00]  background, like newspaper clips and pictures of you, maybe.  Oh, great.  And she sings retarded songs.  Like, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, come on my show, Jerry.  Like, she's retarded.  Looks like Andy Kaufman home footage when he was seven.  Are we going to light up her boobs?  No, we don't want to do anything with her.  Don't touch her, by the way, ladies.  Don't touch her.  And we will show you why.  We're going to show you why you should not touch Sandy.  Have you ever seen Total Recall, the movie?  Yeah.  With Arnold. 
[01:36:30]  Remember Cuato?  It was the little guy growing out of the guy, the middle Cuato.  Well, she has something we like to call Twato.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  It's something.  Who hugged something?  We don't know what it is.  Another life form, a conjoined twin, whatever you want to call it.  I haven't touched her.  She's growing out of an area very close to her.  Who hugged Sandy Cain, by the way?  Because she's more contagious than smallpox.  Colin.  Colin, you hugged her?  Right there.  Oh, Colin, you hugged her?  So I don't think that it'd be fair. 
[01:37:00]  In about a month, you're going to wish you only had anthrax.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hold on.  We can't be too graphic.  Wait, wait, wait.  We can't be too graphic on...  We'd love to hear you talk about that all day long.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Is that your Twato?  Sandy Cain?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Who was the first one to light their breasts on fire on the show?  Sandy, don't touch the TV host that is slowly but surely pushing her chair away. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, be nice, Sandy.  Just talking to the microphone.  Give me a hug, man.  Be nice to the TV host there.  Oh, hi.  How are you doing?  How are you dealing with the terrorist situation?  I put a song.  I mean, I put a song to sing.  Oh, you have a song to sing?  We love when she sings a song.  But when she does, ladies, if we could have you totally clear back because we tend to throw  really heavy objects at her head when she sings these songs.  Oh, you don't think I have a good voice?  I took voice lessons.  I...  All right.  Sandy...  With Bette Midler.  What? 
[01:38:00]  I took voice lessons with Bette Midler.  Sandy, we don't have time for all this crap.  You've got to show Twato.  I'm all dressed here.  Oh, my hemorrhoid cream.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  You knew I was coming.  Yeah.  No pun intended.  Am I going to be able to, like, deal with this right now?  I don't know.  What am I going to be looking at?  I mean, I have the perfect...  If you're on E right now, you're going to be really freaked out in a minute.  What am I going to be looking at?  I have the perfect breath to light on fire.  Don't I?  Why are you backing up? 
[01:38:30]  Change of heart, Lady Lynn.  I'm scared of what's coming out.  Those arms are nice.  I'm scared of what's coming out.  I've never seen Twato.  You ever hear what happened last time she was in?  Hey, here's what happened.  Oh, yeah.  Camouflage.  Great.  That's an award.  They look like they've been in combat.  Look.  Look.  Sandy Kane.  She's got a camel.  Last time, one time when she was in with the Preparation H, we had people, we had a listener  apply Preparation H, and she let the guy apply Preparation H. Here is the actual sound,  and I swear, that she made the first time he did it. He just put a little on his finger 
[01:39:00]  and applied it, and here's the sound she made. Listen closely.  I don't believe it.  She was talking right when she said, I don't believe I'm doing this or something, and she  goes, I don't believe it. You can tell right when it touched. Listen.  I don't believe it.  Because you only make that sound when someone's applying it. Here it is.  I don't believe it.  Then, now Sandy, shut up. Don't get going yet. Here's the second time, and we told him,  now really apply a lot and make sure you really apply it. And here's the sound she made there. 
[01:39:30]  Listen.  Oh!  Yeah, that was right at the moment.  Oh!  So we went from...  I don't believe it.  To...  Oh!  And then the last one where we said, now...  Really, really, I'm talking...  ...application here.  And he really, like...  ...up, and here's the sound she made at that time.  Ow!  Ow!  Okay, what's going to happen right now?  Ow!  Ow!  Is somebody going to shoot off of her at me?  Because I want to get away. 
[01:40:00]  No, she's not like a transformer with torpedoes and...  I know, but this is like, why are there matches and stuff, Sandy? What's going on?  No, she lights her boobs on fire or something.  Why?  I love how she says it so calmly to me, though. I just light my breath on fire.  I light my breath on fire.  And that, and she burns things off her body.  It's the finale of my show, so I do it so much. So it's very second nature.  Do you feel it? Does it burn? I mean...  It's your hair, though. You have all that long hair. Do you ever...  No.  Why would you do that?  Mine didn't light up.  Do you have...  Well, mine do.  ...band-aids on your nipples? What are you doing?  I'll show you. 
[01:40:30]  Oh!  Oh, good God!  Oh, those pasties?  I have to ask.  Aw, I need those.  What are they? Let me see. Let me see.  I want pasties.  You're all right without the pasties.  All right.  Anyway.  What, what, what, Lynn? From Change of Heart, 1.30 in the morning?  This is, yeah, this is exciting.  Isn't it? For you, maybe.  Who's from Jersey? Your boobs are from Jersey?  Hence why, hence why. I'm a hemorrhoid. Thank you to my mother.  Oh, boy. 
[01:41:00]  She got these lately.  What's wrong with them? What's wrong with them?  You're saying what's wrong with them?  What's wrong with them? Wait, wait, wait. Tell me what's wrong with them.  Why are they like that?  They're like Inzies.  They're like an Inzie belly button.  They're Innies.  They look like James Brady after the Reagan shooting.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my good God.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.  I'll explain what's happening.  She has Innies.  She has Innies.  And she puts the matches right in there.  And it's...  I've never seen anything like that in my life.  Isn't that sick? 
[01:41:30]  It looks like the...  Do you have children?  I've never seen that.  What is that?  I know.  I don't know.  You know what's really disgusting?  Something tells me if you squeeze them, they'd be like tubes of Crest toothpaste.  Young hot chicks from Double D's, stop doing drugs immediately, okay?  What's going on over there?  If this isn't a deterrent, stop now.  Sandy, your hair's going to go up.  Watch your hair.  Watch your hair.  No, that would be great.  Wouldn't that be great?  Imagine her hair going up like a flash cube.  That is out of control. 
[01:42:00]  It looks like the CNN footage of the attack on Khyber Pass last night.  Only we have more carnage right here.  Oh, there you go.  She's lighting the matches.  Now, what if it gets down too far?  It's going to burn you.  Does that mean the SNM anyway?  Does she care?  Ah, it's burning her!  Oh, yeah, that felt good.  Oh, my God.  I wish I could see this.  Look, everyone's horrified.  All right.  These are professionals. 
[01:42:30]  Okay.  It gets worse.  See, things could be a lot worse.  And now I light my hemorrhoid.  What?  It's what?  Oh, no.  All right.  All right, Patty.  Why?  Why?  Yeah.  We're from Jersey like you girls.  Hold on.  We're a little distracted.  Hold on.  Jack, what's up?  Yo, guys.  How you doing?  Where are you calling from?  Carn, South Philly.  Okay.  Yeah, they dumped out of the...  Ant was setting up the Preparation H.  Wado deal.  They were dumping out of it.  So, good story. 
[01:43:00]  Once again, ruined by the old button.  I don't understand why...  Yeah.  I mean, it's a little crazy in there.  There's a lot of people going back and forth.  Jack, were you able to hear the sounds?  What's that?  Did you hear all the sounds?  Yeah, most of them, but, you know...  Most of them?  Yeah.  They just...  You heard...  I don't know.  You know, I don't want to get back on track once they already screw you up.  All right, Jack.  Thank you.  We'll have to get to the bottom of that.  Hey, Sam, Philly Peeble.  Phil is actually on the phone.  Phil's the guy that did it. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, Phil.  Oh, wow.  You're the Preparation H guy, right?  What's he doing right now?  Well, I'm not a Preparation H guy.  Last time I came down, I had eight beats for her, but we never got to it.  I was very disappointed.  So was I.  But I like to come into the second sound effect.  It was two fingers, two digits upon Rick's request.  Did he wear rubber guns?  Yeah.  I'm into that.  Is he Greek?  All right.  Is he a Greek guy?  Thanks, Phil.  All right, Sandy.  All right, Sandy.  Enough of you.  We got a song.  Why don't you show everyone Twato first?  Well, I don't know. 
[01:44:00]  Maybe I won't.  I mean...  No, Sandy, you have to.  Come on, Dee Snider.  Just show it.  You're not in here to talk politics.  Yeah.  This is a tragedy, because I used to have to work bottomless as a dancer, and I have this  thing growth on my...  I don't have to say anything.  Yeah, don't even say anything.  Everyone knows where the growth is.  Right.  Okay, all right.  I didn't know.  I never met these people.  Get ready to throw stuff.  I don't have to throw stuff.  I don't have to throw stuff below the belt. 
[01:44:30]  And it's really a tragic thing when you have to dance bottomless and have this...  Ladies, stop doing drugs immediately.  All right.  Because it looks like a mass grave in me life.  It's true, you know, because I was thinking about you guys that, you know...  Sandy, let's talk.  And I was thinking about, like you said, how did it happen?  And when it happened, I was doing a lot of drugs in those days, and I really didn't know.  I think you got a bad bag.  I think I shaved, though.  I remember shaving, and then it happened.  Put me over here by her. 
[01:45:00]  Please pull me over here.  Anyway, so you want to see Twado.  Here's Ghost of Stripper Future.  This is wonderful.  Ghost of Stripper Future.  Oh, my God.  So we don't dance bottomless at Double D's.  Right.  Ladies, here's your future.  You're looking right at it.  Well, she danced at the peep shows and everything.  You'd have, like, guys with...  All right.  That got dumped out of.  Get things to throw at her, because every time we get dumped out of the question, we're going to throw stuff at you. 
[01:45:30]  You're in there.  Okay.  Stop staying...  Stop.  Oh, my God.  Don't say that.  These ladies, I need something else now to throw at you.  What else did she say?  She said something else, though?  I can't say do it either.  Don't say anything.  Don't say it out loud.  Don't say anything.  They're throwing things to me.  Sandy, just please show everyone Twado.  When we say you can't say something, you shouldn't say it again.  I heard that on Channel 2, though, so... 
[01:46:00]  Well, don't worry about what you hear on Channel 2.  Really?  These girls dance at Double D's, and Sandy dances at Double R's, so...  Wait.  Watch my show tonight at 11 o'clock on Channel 56, uh, for RCS.  You've got a better...  I'm waiting to host a change of heart.  It's bumming.  Maybe I have some talent.  Maybe you can have a better slot there.  I have talent.  Oh, is that it?  Here we go.  You're challenging?  She's challenging you.  I have talent, man.  Maybe that's what. 
[01:46:30]  The TV business?  Why not?  You're on the TV.  Where can I get a Sony T-Renitron?  That TV?  I'm a producer, man.  Award winning.  Award winning?  What?  Freaking awards have you won?  Manhattan Able to Network.  Stop it.  They had an award for me.  For what?  For the Sandy Cain Blue Comedy Show.  I'm scared.  You should be.  I got an award.  All right.  Show the ladies what you're for.  This is going to change my heart.  This is always going to be.  This is changing my heart.  I can't believe she's got a better time spot than I knew. 
[01:47:00]  It's horrible.  What is that?  What is that?  Okay.  I've been feeling these girls are going to go back to school after seeing Twato.  All right.  I think this is what India and Pakistan have been fighting for the past 20 years.  I'm just like, I'm still kidding.  All right.  All right.  Is that peach fuzz?  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  I understand.  Just show everyone.  Pull that aside.  And let's see Twato. 
[01:47:30]  Just go ahead.  Do it.  Just do it.  Just show them.  Why does it take a look?  Put your hand down and make sure everyone sees.  Here we go.  Here's the reaction.  Isn't it like the ear that they grew on the back of that mouse?  It looks like a little...  I can't believe my eyes right now.  Is that that bad?  No, stop it.  Wait.  Is that bad?  I don't want to see it.  Is that bad?  I don't want to see it.  You don't want to see it, anyone.  You just went from a 10 to an 8.  It looks like a snail trapped in a nest.  A snail, right?  It looks like a snail trapped in a nest. 
[01:48:00]  Very good.  No, wait.  Didn't you see it?  Hey, guys.  I don't want to see it.  Lynn hasn't seen it.  I want them to know.  All right, Lynn, you've got to see it.  What is it?  Lynn, you've got to see it.  You've got to see it.  It's Twato.  Oh, my God.  It's not bad.  I don't want to keep police departments watching this.  Look at her face.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  What is that?  You can't shave.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  Let me write it down for you.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Let Obie write it down for you, and then you can read it.  You don't need a dermatologist. 
[01:48:30]  You need an F-130 helicopter.  I'm going to put it on the Internet.  Is that what it was?  Yeah, that's real.  Well, I guess it's good to see it, so you know.  Yeah, right.  It was on it.  Oh, yeah.  Make it up for Halloween.  You know?  All right.  Sandy, be quiet.  Be quiet.  Sandy, when you lie, does that get longer?  Sandy, how could you be offended?  No, that you say that, can I say what I said?  Yeah.  Genital warts. 
[01:49:00]  I mean, I don't have genital warts, and you're telling everyone that, you know, I went out  with a guy, he said, you know, I'm not going to have sex with you because O.P. and Anthony  said you have genital warts.  And I was dying for him, man, and it was really tough.  I said, well, I don't have genital warts, and they said, well, O.P. and Anthony said you  do.  All right.  Who is this guy?  His name was George.  His name was Vic.  His name was Dick.  All right, Sandy, why the attitude today?  Why the attitude?  Yeah, because genital warts, man.  We made you even more famous.  We'll take up the challenge.  Infamous, man. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, I walked into a club.  Everyone walked away from me, bar nine, because they thought I had genital warts.  They said, don't come near me.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  I mean, it's bad enough people will run away from me, but now you tell everyone that  I got that, and that's not true.  Put that on it.  Sandy, don't make us throw stuff.  Unless you send me to a doctorate and verify that.  In the graveyard teeth, we can call a doctor in here to examine.  No, we're going to take up the challenge.  You're coming back.  We'll get some doctors in here, and I'll bet you as much money as you want that that is 
[01:50:00]  genital warts.  Well, how do you know so much about genital warts?  Because of me, Tom Brokaw has genital warts.  Because someone sent us to a website, and it's very similar to what you're sporting.  So, I'm sporting it, huh?  All right, instead of you getting mad, we're going to, Rick is going to bring you back.  We're going to bring some doctors in here, and they'll tell us exactly what it is, okay?  Cut it off.  I would like to know.  All right, I've got to interrupt.  I've got to interrupt it off and put it into a bag of corn chips.  I've got to interrupt.  Pork rinds.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what's up? 
[01:50:30]  We have a comedy legend on the phone right now.  Oh, George Carlin.  Hey, there's nothing wrong with genital warts.  Huh?  Tell the lady there's nothing wrong with genital warts.  Nothing wrong with genital warts.  You shouldn't put a frog in that place anyway, ever.  George, there is something going on down there.  It looks like that ear that they grew on the back of that mouse.  Oh, yeah.  And it's about an inch away from her ground zero, if you know what I mean.  And she's saying it's not genital warts.  We kind of think it might be, so now we're just going to get a doctor to confirm. 
[01:51:00]  And who's looking at this thing?  You?  Everybody.  All of us.  Oh.  It's awful.  It's like an attraction.  Oh, all right.  George, if you were here...  I've got to get back in the radio.  George, if you were here, you would be looking at it.  Yeah.  I've got to get back in the radio if this is going on.  George, we could send you pictures if you like.  I knew it changed, but boy, this is really a good development.  What?  You know...  Sandy has something to say to George Carlin.  Your assistant...  I think his name is Ross.  Do you have an assistant, Ross?  Yeah, Ross used to...  Yeah, he still works for us, not in that role anymore. 
[01:51:30]  But he always orders tapes for me, and I know that he worked for you.  Yes, absolutely.  I thought you were stealing some of my material.  Yeah, I know, but that's the way I got to the middle.  George, I have to apologize for the crazy lady.  What's her name?  It's Sandy Keen.  She's okay in my book.  Thank you.  That's a bad book.  I'm on...  Are you at...  My book is Mein Kampf, by the way.  All right, Sandy, be quiet.  We've got to talk to George for a little while.  Yeah.  Hey, George. 
[01:52:00]  Hey there, you.  Why don't you come in this time?  We enjoyed you last time.  It's a long haul.  It's about 27, 2800 miles.  Oh, you're in L.A.?  Yeah.  Are you flying yet?  Yeah, yeah.  I've been flying.  I ain't worried about that stuff.  I just didn't want to...  You know what?  We charter a lot anyway, especially for our shorter jumps.  So we just extended that a little more to stay out of the lines the first week.  We didn't want to, like, be part of the experiment at the airport.  Yeah.  Well, I've got to ask you, you know, you're pretty on top of things politically.  What's your take on what's going on?  Well, I'm just a guy who enjoys watching the world destroy itself, so... 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, well, you always have to.  It's always been a kind of hobby of mine.  I view things from a distance, but I do not want smallpox.  No.  Who does?  No.  Sandy Keen.  So I feel personally involved this time.  Yeah.  You don't want the anthrax either, I'm sure.  You don't want...  Nothing ends in an X.  I don't want it.  Who's opening up your mail these days, Mr. Carler?  You know what?  I volunteer for that myself.  Yeah, really?  When's the next special?  Hey, that's what I want to tell you about. 
[01:53:00]  It's November 17th at the Beacon Theater.  It's a live show on the satellite from HBO.  It's November 17th.  Actually, I'm working two nights there.  We taped the first night in case the satellite gets shot down.  So I got two shows at the Beacon.  The 16th of Friday, the 17th of Saturday of November.  We'll all be there for that.  I'll be.  I know I got to be there, they told me.  It's going to be good, though.  It's a strong show.  I had to make a few alterations, because you want to hear the name of what the show was called, 
[01:53:30]  and I'm telling you the truth?  Yeah.  The name of it was, I kind of like it, when a lot of people die.  Wow.  Yeah, and it was all about natural disasters and stuff.  Right.  And I had a nice nine-minute piece on that, but the morning that I woke up and saw the special effects thing on the TV,  I thought, oh, yeah, oh, change, change in the name.  So what's the name now?  Complaints and Grievances, which is really right to the core of my being.  It's loaded with the usual kind of complaints about different kind of people and their behavior and their society and stuff. 
[01:54:00]  So everything's the same, except I had to take that piece out.  I just knew no one would laugh, you know, obviously.  Yeah.  Do you basically dislike people?  No.  You know what?  Not people, but the human being.  Yes.  I kind of, I have divorced myself from the human race.  I like individuals, oddly enough.  I'm wonderful with people one-on-one, and I really have a nice heart with them, and I connect very well. 
[01:54:30]  But once they start to group up, once they clot, once they have a little hat or a T-shirt or a slogan or an armband or a cheer  or something that makes them part of a group, I think they lose part of the human beauty, and I'm out.  Just count me out.  Yeah, I've always been on the outside looking in on that.  So that's kind of my division on that.  Yeah.  What do you think about our response now to this over there in Afghanistan?  Well, you know, first of all, I don't know.  I think what you've got to do here is you've got to find certain people and kill them, I guess. 
[01:55:00]  That's pretty basic.  If I was at the meeting, I would say, get in there and kill certain people.  You've got to kill certain people?  You've got to kill that number two guy.  He's the real brains.  That number two guy, he's the real brains.  Obama's a figurehead and he's got money and he's probably smart, but this other guy is really sharp.  It's always the number two guy, isn't it?  Yeah.  That's it.  Kills certain people.  But I'm sorry I don't have something real funny to say about all that stuff, but you know what it is?  No, I kind of like your take on it. 
[01:55:30]  Kills certain people.  You've got to kill a lot of people.  You know what I've always said?  You know the only thing you get that makes change in the world?  Bloodshed.  Widespread bloodshed.  The only thing that's ever really lasts.  It's the same with assassinations.  You watch when they start killing these people in the Middle East, when some of these kings start getting knocked off.  When the second wave of this thing is, they'll knock off some of these kings.  They'll kill Arafat.  They'll do another cabinet minister in Israel.  It'll be chaos.  But that's how you change the life on earth is by killing people. 
[01:56:00]  It's really the only thing that's ever worked.  All right.  Oh, George Carlin, everybody.  Woo!  It's true.  No, I understand.  There's a big element of truth in what I'm saying.  No, absolutely.  Absolutely.  It's just, you know, coming out of George Carlin, it's a little odd.  Yeah.  But not really when you really think about what your act's all about.  Here's an idea I got for the airplanes.  Make them safe.  Okay.  The only guys you let on are guys named Marshall.  How's that?  Penny Marshall, you let her on.  Gary Marshall. 
[01:56:30]  Marshall Brickman.  I think we'll be safe.  You know, it could work.  How about all Marshalls?  No passengers.  Just Marshalls.  Sky Marshalls.  Yeah.  Just that.  Mr. Carlin, can I ask you a question?  It seems like as the years have gone on, this is why I like you so much, it seems like you  get, like, less and less concerned about offending people or violating their morals.  Is that like a conscious thing or is it just a natural evolution for you?  Well, it starts as unconscious, you know, and then I have to decide to do it, too, so it's 
[01:57:00]  conscious at the end of the thing.  But the cycle starts as something where it's really important, I think, to be yourself.  And I have always felt out of step and apart and separate.  There was this famous psychologist, Abraham Maslow, who said, the fully realized man does  not identify with the local group.  And I do not identify with the local group.  Whether you want to identify it as a religion, a country, a state, a city, a democratic club,  a neighborhood association, PTA, I don't care what it is, I don't identify with it. 
[01:57:30]  And that includes humans.  So, therefore, I have these feelings that are kind of different.  And I like saying them.  It makes me feel good.  I've noticed that, though, over the years.  Do you get people writing and saying, oh, I used to like you and think you were funny,  but when you said this, it pissed me off?  Yeah, and I always let them off the hook.  See, like a golfing guy did a whole thing about how horrible golf is and how racist it  is and how elitist.  And a guy would say to me, I really like you, George.  What do you got against golf? 
[01:58:00]  I say, you play golf?  He say, yes, I'm letting you off the hook.  You don't have to worry.  I give special dispensations, just like the Pope.  I don't hold everybody responsible.  See, I meet one guy.  Individuals are great.  I love them, and I let them off the hook.  But as a group, they suck.  So you don't like to force them in golf?  I don't like golf.  Golf just represents too many evil things.  I'll have to catch that part maybe in one of your books or in your app.  It's in the book that did well this year, Napalm and Silly Putty. 
[01:58:30]  Right.  It's in there.  It's from the 1992 show at Madison Square Garden, and it's in there.  It's called Golf Courses for the Homeless.  It's really, really a nice piece.  I'll pick that one up.  Hey, George, a lot of people say in your airport security bid is the greatest.  That was a good hunk.  I'm glad it was the last show, not this one.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was ahead of them on that.  I told them, I said, the first thing they do when you sit down is they give you a knife  and fork.  You know?  I mean, what is that?  And then, so they say, oh, we're going to stop giving silverware.  They didn't listen to the comedian in 1999. 
[01:59:00]  Did you catch flack?  This is what I heard.  I don't know if it's true.  Did you catch flack from Comic Relief because of an anorexia joke you did?  No, no, no.  I did anorexia jokes, but they never, I had a whole thing about, I didn't understand anorexia.  But I can't use the word on the radio.  You got a delay?  Tony.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Hey, all right.  Look at that.  So I said that.  They never said anything to me, though.  Girls are all putting their clothes back on because of you now. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Whoa.  Wow.  All right, George.  When's the special?  They got a restaurant here in Beverly Hills for anorexics.  It's called Start Without Me.  The special is broadcast on the night of the 17th in November.  It's a Saturday night, 10 o'clock on HBO, and that's the show at the Beacon Theater, 73rd and Broadway.  Same thing with the Friday night, but it's a taping.  It's for all the money, but it's a taping. 
[02:00:00]  Friday the 16th, and it's Ticketmaster, you know, .com or Ticketmaster outlets and all that stuff.  All right, George Carlin.  Hey, thanks for the chance to talk about the show.  I really appreciate it, guys.  And I will come in and sit around with you here next time I'm through and things I'm breathing are right, okay?  I mean, I don't have a ton of stuff to do.  I promise you, if you want me to, I'll do that.  I'd like to.  Hell, yeah.  We'd love to have you in here, and we'll bring Sinecane back.  Good.  Hey, yes, and by then, maybe that thing will be better.  All right.  Great time. 
[02:00:30]  Cool.  Thank you, George.  George?  Okay, thanks a lot.  George?  Yes?  You're a comic genius.  Oh, no, but I am a lot of fun.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay, bye-bye.  George Carlin, everyone.  Right on.  I like that.  The little M thing.  Norton never missing an opportunity to kiss a great comic's ass.  I love Carlin, man.  There he goes.  Or Ozzy's ass.  All right, we've got to take a break, Ant.  Yeah.  The pictures are up for the first contestants of the Boobalander contest.  Oh, they are, are they?  Go to opieandanthony.com.  Are the Patty pictures up there in the hot outfit? 
[02:01:00]  Patty pictures are up.  All right, cool.  Lots of good stuff to see at opieandanthony.com as we take a break.  Colin Quinn in the studio.  Don't forget, he's playing Caroline's tomorrow night at 9.30.  All right.  Time to talk about water.  Not just water, Opie.  It's O2Go.  It's oxygenated, distilled drinking water. 
[02:01:30]  You know, distilled water, very healthy for you.  But for some reason, the distilling process doesn't leave a great-tasting water.  When they oxygenate it, that's when it tastes great and becomes very good for you.  Gives you like a perk-me-up without the caffeine because you're getting more oxygen into your system.  Look for O2Go, original blue, delicious, calorie-free, essence flavors,  or the exclusive black sport bottle with even more oxygen when you need it.  That's right, O2Go.  They set the purity standard against which all other waters will be measured someday in the future 
[02:02:00]  when they measure purity standards for water.  It's O2Go, real pure, great taste, no aftertaste.  Check it out wherever you get water.  Oxygenated, distilled drinking water.  It's O2Go.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're all going to the YouTube concert tonight at the Garden.  Can't wait.  Not all of us, the girls from Double D's in Morristown.  They have to leave us because they have a benefit tonight for one of the World Trade Center charities. 
[02:02:30]  Half the money that you guys take in tonight will go to a great cause.  Anthony's distracted because the picture of Stalker Patty wearing, I think it was Laura, right?  Laura's outfit.  Really hot, white, see-through.  And Laura is slinging this thing around.  You need to keep it away from your face.  That is so fun.  It's got funk on it right now.  It's got what?  Funk.  Why is that?  She's a little smelly. 
[02:03:00]  Why are you touching it?  Patty was a little stinky.  Patty was a little stinky.  Did Patty stink up your hot thing?  What?  Sorry, Patty.  You can keep it.  She's throwing that hot thing away?  I feel bad for Patty right now.  She's sitting outside the door looking at it.  Patty.  I didn't say that.  Patty stunk up your hot thing?  Smell it.  Smell it.  No.  No way.  I would never smell that.  I would never even hear it.  I can't even smell it.  No effing way.  Smell it. 
[02:03:30]  Opie, I want to see you in it.  Smell the crotch.  Smell the crotch, Opie.  Smell the crotch.  Go, go, go.  No, you're not going to do it.  You are disgusting.  Are you doing it?  Yeah.  Norton will do it.  He didn't even blink.  Give it to Norton.  He'll smell it.  He'll smell anything.  Norton.  He's like Mikey.  Yeah.  He'll smell anything.  Oh, he's smelt it.  What did you smell, Opie?  I didn't smell anything.  Norton, smell the crotch.  Norton, smell the crotch.  Norton, you are nasty.  Oh, my gosh.  You are nasty.  He's touching it on his nose. 
[02:04:00]  It smells like a big kahuna burger.  That's a big kahuna burger.  Say one again.  Get Patty in here.  Mind if I have some of your tasty beverage?  Get Patty in here.  Patty.  Oh, Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  What happened there?  They're teasing.  We're sorry.  Did you spink up the hot stripper's outfit?  How do you ever have to say that?  I think she's very sexy in it.  Patty, the crotch area smells like Staten Island.  Hey, that's an insult for people living in Staten Island.  Yeah, right? 
[02:04:30]  Patty, did you work today?  Yes, I did.  And you worked at McDonald's?  Oh, I love McDonald's.  Was there a bike ride?  I love McDonald's.  It's a mad house.  I work at McDonald's.  Before I get dressed, I always have a motor.  Oh, I love it.  I keep it in my locker.  Well, all right, Patty.  So you worked hard, and you might have been sweating over the fryer?  I didn't work in the fryer.  Where did you work? 
[02:05:00]  Well, after I made the food, I went out on deliveries.  Deliveries.  So you worked up kind of a funk?  Yeah, but I used deodorant.  You know, most of the heat is released through the top of your head,  so you have to take that plastic bag off your head.  And you missed out, though.  She goes, but I used deodorant.  We're not talking about that area.  Oh.  Did you do jumping jacks and pantyhose?  He's talking about your nana.  Your nana.  I just got over my period.  Let's get him. 
[02:05:30]  Woo!  Hey, hey!  Thank God!  Hey, there's something on here every day, huh?  I'm wearing that home.  Now I really have a change of heart.  Wow!  I don't have...  I don't double D's now.  I don't double D's now.  I don't double D's now.  I don't double D's now.  I don't double D's now.  I don't double D's now.  I don't double D's now.  I don't go to bed.  We got girls babbling.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:00]  She just...  All right.  We're leaving.  Patty just got over her time, so that seems to be maybe where that fragrance was coming  from.  Do you use the FDS or the feminine hygiene spray or something?  You ever use that?  You ever use a douche?  Something like that?  Oh, my God.  You ever squat over a bug bum?  I take a shower.  I use soap.  Oh.  Soap.  Soap.  Some of the good old lie soap, kid. 
[02:06:30]  What kind of soap do you use this?  I use possum towel soap.  Oh, my God.  So, what is the feedback?  Mike wants to know if Patty worked at the Flay-O-Fish station today.  No.  Were you making the McFish sandwich?  No.  I had it for lunch.  Were you filling the cherry pies?  No.  We don't have cherry pies until Christmas time.  Hey, the hot strippers.  Like, oh, I'm being looked at now in a whole disgusting new life. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, the hot strippers are getting mad at us.  You all right, ladies?  No.  There's a lot of guys.  You bumped out the hot strippers, then.  They're the ones that said it smelled.  And we were doing so well.  For once, we were doing well with the hot strippers.  No, I didn't.  You smelled that right there.  What was it?  Was there anything going on?  Smelled like a bowl of pennies.  Oh, look at Patty.  She's all embarrassed. 
[02:07:30]  Don't be embarrassed.  You're going to make her cry.  Well, it wouldn't be the first time.  Here's you two tonight at the garden.  Hey, what's that smell?  Patty, why don't you get slowed down?  Coming from the woman with the wig.  Get out of the building.  Oh, no.  Smells like a rotten Guinness.  Boy, girl. 
[02:08:00]  Patty, can you go shower before you join us at the U2 show?  Yeah.  Do you really have to go there?  What?  I'll take your place.  No.  Patty.  You can work for me, and I'll go for you.  When did you get done with it?  What?  You said you just got.  Two days ago.  Two days ago?  Yeah, and I took a shower every night.  Yeah?  Do you leave the bathwater and just get back in it the next day, or do you drain?  No, I take a shower in the bathtub.  What product do you use?  Not for soap, but for that time. 
[02:08:30]  What's your favorite product?  Sure.  I like the strawberry gel from Avon.  Oh, look.  Do you use the pad, or do you use the pond?  Do you use a pond?  I prefer the pond because it's cleaner.  I don't like the pond.  Look at her.  She's like, cleaner.  Ooh.  She can't even talk about it.  I don't fly on the wings of a maxi.  Like that?  You don't normally talk about stuff like that, right?  I don't like the, yeah.  Okay, well.  All right, we're in England.  Yeah, I knew the hot strippers would leave now. 
[02:09:00]  Imagine the poor tampon that goes, oh, it's got to be her that buys me.  Can't be one of these hot girls that are in the studio.  Like that poor tampon that gets taken out of the box and goes, oh, thanks.  What did I do?  What the hell did I do to deserve this?  All right, Patty.  Can you really come see us?  Yeah, we'll come see you.  We're doing the U2 thing today.  Double D's.  Double D's.  Nice.  Without a doubt, I have to see you new ladies, of course.  It's a very attractive girl down here.  Double D's, yes.  I'll show you my knee.  Your knee.  Oh, hey, a little call back, Norton. 
[02:09:30]  We're back on the knee.  All right, ladies, we want to thank the ladies of Double D's.  Beautiful girls of Double D's.  They have to get out of here.  They're doing a great thing tonight, once again, in Morristown.  Now, half the money they bring in tonight, they're going to throw at one of the charities  for the World Trade Center, okay?  Very good.  That picture of Patty in that get-up right next to Laura.  Yeah, it's a split-screen picture.  Classic.  It looks like if Laura had been at the Chernobyl site in that dress, and you took the picture 
[02:10:00]  maybe a few years later, after the radiation had taken its toll.  All right, Ant, this just in, you two will be dedicating Sunday Bloody Sunday to Stalker  Patty tonight.  Who is Patty going to the U2 concert?  Who are you going with?  Yeah, who are you going?  Yeah, you got two tickets.  Get on, Mike.  You got two tickets.  A friend of mine, his name is Steve.  I used to work for him a long time ago.  Yeah.  A dog sit for him when he goes on vacation with his wife. 
[02:10:30]  He must really love you, too, man.  He must love you, too.  He loves the band.  Oh, I'm sure he does.  Why the hell else would he go?  Wait, and he goes on vacation with his wife?  Well, yeah, he's married.  Have you ever pulled around with him?  No, he's not.  No, of course not.  I'm not that kind of a person.  She's the kind of person.  She's a 45-year-old virgin.  She's a virgin.  When they leave, I play with the dogs.  I'm serious.  The two huskies in the house.  I'm serious.  45, she is a virgin.  Never had the pleasure or displeasure of a man. 
[02:11:00]  Patty, look.  Yeah, I just prefer to save myself for someone special.  Save myself?  Oh, Jesus Christ, when you meet him after you're dead?  Who the hell are you saying?  Patty, you could not afford to let them shave your head.  Why did you do that?  It'll grow back.  Hey, Patty, when your dog's sitting...  You've had another five years while you're saying.  They ask me.  When you're dog sitting, do you ever apply moist pink lipstick?  No.  No, I just throw the balls and then they catch it and play with them. 
[02:11:30]  That is truly disgusting.  Like that urban legend with the peanut butter, have you ever heard of it?  Oh, of course.  Who hasn't?  We go home and all of a sudden the dog is going to town.  Oh, my God.  Okay, well, yeah.  Where are we going now?  Should we take a break and catch up?  We'll catch up.  Well, we have Sandy Cain.  She wants to sing her song.  What?  Is she coming back?  She's coming back.  Is she coming back?  I'm scared of her.  And we have Lynn from Change of Heart, the new host of Change of Heart. 
[02:12:00]  Are you enjoying yourself?  This is fun.  It's like hanging out at the bus station.  Use that in the promo.  Yeah, that's a promo.  But without the security.  It's a little scary.  It's less hygienic.  Isn't it kind of like a, I don't know, it's kind of like a dorm room or something.  There's freaks coming in and out.  It's a scary dorm room, Anthony.  I don't know what kind of dorm room you've been in.  Well, usually the scary ones.  But it's usually girls that are coming in and out that the guys don't want their friends 
[02:12:30]  to see.  If anyone ever had Sandy in their dorm room, I think they'd have to like bludgeon her to  death to make sure no one saw her.  It's happened.  Hey, hey, hey.  She is really sick, isn't she?  She's scary to me.  And how did I kill myself?  Because she said her body was better than mine.  Did you hear her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's like, you have a nice face, but your body's horrible.  I'm like, okay, well, I'm going to go and get on the freaking treadmill right now.  Wart woman.  At least there is an alien creature is growing on you. 
[02:13:00]  As far as we know.  Yeah, and because there's radio, we've got to say Lynn is hot.  You have an unbelievable body.  Mary?  She has a very unbelievable body.  Yeah.  Sandy would be hot on Jupiter, where it's like eight billion times our own gravity.  You know?  You know where Sandy's body would be hot?  In a bicycle basket flying in front of the moon. 
[02:13:30]  I knew she'd look familiar.  And the other thing I noticed, is she still here?  She can hear all this?  Yes.  We don't care.  You guys don't care, but she's going to follow me.  She insulted you.  No, but you know what it is?  Is she missing teeth?  Oh, that's a whole other story.  Oh, bring up the teeth.  That's a whole other kettle of fish.  Okay.  Oh, great.  You let me talk about her, and you don't tell me there's something you're not supposed to talk about.  Get Sandy in here.  You can talk about twaddle, but not a teeth.  Get Sandy in here. 
[02:14:00]  You can talk about a disgusting growth.  You guys, is this something you're not supposed to look at?  Wouldn't you tell me?  Yeah, yeah.  She's got a head of steam.  Sandy?  Amen.  You are kind of heavy on the bottom, man.  What?  It's kind of heavy on the bottom.  She is hot.  Sandy, you're wrong.  Sandy, you are insane.  Shut up, girl.  I mean, I need a treadmill.  You are insane.  You need a treadmill.  I mean, it's called a spade a spade.  You need a treadmill.  When you shoot heroin, Sandy, you don't shoot it into the gums.  Sandy, Lynn brought up your teeth. 
[02:14:30]  Great.  You know, I mean, I'm not perfect, but you certainly aren't either.  Perfect.  No wonder you've got a 130 time slot.  I mean, it's a show everyone knows.  She's great late night.  She's so mean.  Sandy, she's beautiful.  Her face is great.  And she's funny, too, Sandy.  She's very funny.  She's so mean.  Her voice is annoying.  She reminds me of my mother.  Very funny.  Sandy, okay, I'm not funny, but you're like a little dumpster kitty. 
[02:15:00]  Like, I can't be thinner.  Dumpster kitty.  No, I just want to say, you know, like, I am thinner.  Look at your hips.  Thinner?  Thinner?  Thinner?  Thinner?  Okay, you're...  Am I thinner?  Am I now, you guys, in all fairness, she's right.  She is thinner than me.  Changed ever since that house fell on you.  You've changed.  Obey and Anthony fell on me.  Wait, say that again.  Sandy.  They probably dumped out of the other stuff.  Ah, forget it.  Yeah, right, right, right.  Sandy.  Obey and Anthony dumped on me. 
[02:15:30]  Sandy, you can't tell me that you believe that your body is more attractive than hers.  No, she won't stand up.  You can't.  She is beautiful.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  In all fairness, she's right.  No, she's not.  No, look at you.  What are you...  God, just stop it.  No.  No.  That's a woman's build.  Just, please, stop.  But, you know what I think is bothering me, though, is that I'm grossing out Sandy.  That's what's scaring me.  I know. 
[02:16:00]  Ain't that horrible?  Sandy is grossed out by me.  Lynn just stood up and now I can't.  That says a lot right there.  What?  She's competitive.  How tall a girl are you?  You're like 5'10".  I'm 5'10".  Yeah.  She's a tall girl and she's completely proportioned in a beautiful way, Sandy.  Her hips, man.  Look at her hips.  They're feminine hips.  Are you talking about her hips?  Look at you.  Look at my double D's and they're real.  The only real breast in this whole place.  Droopy and droopy.  And indented... 
[02:16:30]  I'd like to see your penis.  I know you would.  You'd like to see any.  No.  No, it's not your mule.  No.  You guys aren't showing it to me, either.  No.  Believe me.  I'd sooner chop it off than let you even look.  He wouldn't.  I want to take a picture of Colin in the toilet.  He wouldn't.  What?  Of course he wouldn't.  Why not?  Oh, I'd like to put your head underwater until you drown, but you didn't want to.  Maybe he would have.  This is a whole new Sandy Kane.  You are a Sandy Kane.  Dr. Obi and Anthony...  You know, in an outfit, you look like Frankenfurter. 
[02:17:00]  How can you criticize her?  How do you criticize her?  No, it's not Frankenfurter.  It's the one, the other one.  What was her name?  Magenta.  She's looking at Magenta.  Sandy, you've got to understand something.  That is a beautiful young woman, and you're not.  And you're criticizing someone like that.  Sandy is attractive.  She is very attractive in the dark.  I'm not saying...  Sandy, what's your...  She's throwing stones at me, and look at her hips. 
[02:17:30]  I am not throwing stones at you.  You are so mean.  I just said you were attractive.  No, you say, Patty smells, and I'm this, and I'm not.  She didn't say that.  She didn't say that.  One of the dancers did.  Is she drunk?  For these young bimbos.  I don't have to say drunk.  Young bimbos.  Is there...  All right, Sandy.  Tell the truth.  Sandy, let me ask you something now.  Is there a tad bit of jealousy at the young women's bodies that were stripping?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Totally.  She agreed.  I'm very jealous.  Well, when the Indians were attacking and the wagons were in a circle, you were hot.  Hey, I hope your other head is better than the one on your neck. 
[02:18:00]  Oh.  Where's she at?  Where's your head, man?  That rivals Marion in the comeback category.  Get a wig or something.  Sandy, why are you so angry?  Why are you so angry?  Why are you so angry?  That's just the way I ask.  Like, who was to talk to you?  Why are you so...  Yeah, why so vicious today?  I've raved five times.  All right, so one blind guy.  What about...  Oh, God.  Like, you came on the show and you showed your little thing, and then you thought people  weren't going to tease you?  Like, why are you so angry?  We like the fun-loving Sandy Kane. 
[02:18:30]  What happened to you?  Angry.  I'm not angry.  What happened?  I'm angry.  That wasn't rape, Sandy.  They just skipped out on the check.  I mean, I know your past as far as Dan...  I was raped, man.  And as far as...  Were you ever into prostitution?  I was getting raped.  Were you ever into prostitution?  I have deep psychological problems.  You do?  Imagine that.  I mean...  So does the gang.  Come on, Sandy.  You can't rape.  Come on.  Okay.  You're tough, man. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  You're tough, man.  Well, now you put things in perspective.  All the guys were Jewish, though.  I trusted them.  Bugsy Siegel?  What does that mean?  Bugsy Siegel.  Here's the old Sandy laughing.  Relative Jeff Siegel, though.  But, you know, I was Jewish, so I trusted the guys, because my parents always brought me  up to trust people.  At least you didn't feel anything.  So what are...  Five Jewish guys.  Five Jewish guys.  Well, you were hanging out in Miami with five Jewish guys.  Yeah.  And you're just what?  What are you doing?  No, what happened was...  What is it? 
[02:19:30]  One hole in the sheet.  I drove down to Miami Beach with these five Jewish guys.  Right.  Stopped in a motel.  Uh-huh.  And we were just asleep overnight.  They were Jewish, so I trusted them.  Right.  And in the bed, they all gang-raped me.  Oh, my God.  What year was this?  They were Jewish, so it was a Motel 6.  What year was this, Sandy?  It was...  40...  You know, I've kind of put it out of my mind. 
[02:20:00]  What year?  You guys always bring up...  Around what year?  A rough year.  I'm asking.  Was one of them named Moses?  The Jewish guy's...  Coward court.  Well, was it the 50s?  No, it was later than that.  It was the 60s.  It was more like 70.  1970, you would say.  And you were doing that.  How did you meet these guys?  I just met them in the music business.  They were a band?  A Jewish band?  A Jewish band.  They said, we're going to Miami.  Why don't you come?  I love rain. 
[02:20:30]  You're Jewish.  So you just, like, hopped in the car?  You didn't know these guys?  I kind of knew.  No, I'm not saying it's your fault.  I would never say that to a girl that's been in that situation.  But you have to think a little bit that that might have been a little risky for you.  No, and my parents gave you our blessings.  They're Jewish boys.  Go.  Parents gave their blessings.  Yes.  And, you know, they're Jewish.  Geez, what a fork in the road that made for Sandy King.  Did you have that thing back then?  The twaddle?  No.  What year did that start making appearances?  When I was dancing, everyone was shaving down there. 
[02:21:00]  So I figured, why don't I shave?  Were you dancing before this happened?  Or did this send you on the road to pornography?  On the road to pornography.  That did it.  Oh.  Wow.  So what were you thinking?  What did you want to do with your life before that tragedy?  I wanted to be a singer like Barbra Streisand.  Oh.  Jewish, by the way, Barbra Streisand.  So wait, you found it when you came in?  No, I was on the line with him.  So then all of a sudden, that happens. 
[02:21:30]  And what?  Was it hidden?  And you just went into porno.  Anthony, was it hidden?  Is she saying it was hidden until she shaved?  She was finger popped.  Yeah, she said she shaved, cut herself, and then it grew.  Got out of control.  It grew.  I got to go to the phone.  All right.  Chad has something to say.  Chad, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just wondering if Sandy flosses her teeth with a rusty bike chain.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, that's not what it said on the screen, Anthony.  I know.  Come on, Chad.  What type of talk is that?  It's true, man.  I like him. 
[02:22:00]  He's honest.  We have to take a break.  When we come back, we'll let you sing.  Finger pops.  We'll sing your song.  I like that.  Finger pops.  Hey, Sandy, we're going to let you sing your latest song, okay?  What's the name of the song?  What's the name?  Leave Lynn alone, okay?  Osama bin Laden song.  Osama bin Laden.  Oh, I get it.  Isn't that Jewish?  Is it a comedy song?  Or is it serious?  It's kind of tragic.  Very deep tragedy.  Okay, well, we'll keep going to listen to this.  The best comedy you know is tragic.  Is it about five Muslims raping a woman in a motel? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my God.  And it was a motel sex.  It was very Jewish.  Watch this.  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.  I made it out of the way.  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.  Huh?  I was raped, I say.  Oh.  All right.  Well, let's take it into the gutter.  We'll let her sing next.  Right.  Bring it down.  The street's wild.  We love seeing moves.  The street's wild.  Love it.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everybody can run around the street.  Yeah, close up.  Rip a loud wedding day.  I'm probably in the idea.  There's a cure for cancer.

Um, Rick just took a picture of Lynn and Sandy Kane.  We're going to have a poll up on OpieandAnthony.com in the very near future.  You've got to...  You really need a poll.  You've got to vote.  If I lose, I'm killing myself.  I just want you to know.  We're going to spot Sandy.  I'm taking my own life.  Yeah, and you've got to vote for who's hotter.  Uh, uh, uh, look at her head.  Uh, uh. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, my God.  I couldn't be mean to her, though.  It was like having a hooker on 11th Avenue just yell at you.  Like, you just got that.  Hey, who hasn't had that happen?  How many times, right, Colin?  I just popped back.  Colin can't even talk.  Colin loves this place.  I know.  I really do.  It really is amazing.  It's like a...  It is like the daycare facility at a mental institution.  You pay your people just walking around in various states of distress.  We solved it.  Go ahead, go ahead.  And playing foosball and getting their medication. 
[02:25:30]  I thought Twana was going to be like some little trick she did.  Oh, wow.  And then when it came out, it was like...  I know.  It's got a little personality of its own.  It's like Afghani topography.  It looked like a satellite shot.  I thought Twana was like a puppet or something.  After the bombshell.  No.  What's her name in Lamb Chop?  Right, right.  I thought it was going to be something cute.  Hi, I'm Twana.  Hello.  Yeah, I thought it was...  Twana and Lamb Chop.  Everyone's yelling at us.  Get me away.  You're so disgusting. 
[02:26:00]  You're so disgusting.  Yeah, well, they're yelling on the phone line.  Where's the Santa Cain song?  All right, let's bring her...  You know, we didn't get to play our Ted Knight songs today.  Ah?  Give them a little taste.  No.  Yeah, let's...  We can give them a little taste of Ted Knight.  Matt and Huggy from WISP in Philly.  Yeah.  When we were down visiting Philly, they gave us the Ted Knight Sings record.  Ted Knight Sings.  Who's Lou, Mary, Mary, Monroe. 
[02:26:30]  Okay, Boogie.  All right, we got to give them...  Which one is good?  We got to give them just a quick taste.  Where is the bop?  Who put the bop?  All right, listen to this.  Who put the bop in the bop show?  This came out when?  Like 1975.  So it's kind of songs that were popular at the time for some reason or another.  And Ted Knight, Ted Baxter from Mary Tyler Moore, was singing some of these songs.  I don't know who told them it was a good idea. 
[02:27:00]  I'd like to thank the guy...  That's brilliant.  ...for the song...  He's putting on a voice.  ...made my baby and fall in love with me.  Oh, no.  You guys picked him in the studio?  Yeah.  Who put the bop in the bop, a bop, a bop, a bop.  Who put the ram in the ram, a ram, a ding-dong.  Who put the bop in the bop, a bop, a bop.  Who put the lids in the jam, a ding-dong.  Who was that man?  Who was that man?  Who was that man?  I can't take a nap. 
[02:27:30]  Was it you, Johnny?  He made my baby fall in love with me.  Oh, no.  Yes.  When my baby heard the bop, a bop, a bop, a bop.  I'm going to be gay.  Every word went right into her heart.  What?  And when she heard them singing,  ...  ...  ...  ...  Who put the bop in the bop, a bop, a bop, a bop. 
[02:28:00]  Who put the bop in the bop, a bop, a bop, a bop, a bop, a bop, a bop.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in  and you've got the stock market beat.  But the man that's worthwhile is the man that can smile  when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay, Pookie, listen to the book.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, we have a whole album, Doc.  Yeah, that's just a little taste.  It's like the Monster Mash, the guy who's the same.  Yeah, yeah.  He did the mash.  All right, all right.  He did the Monster Mash.  Lou, Lou, Mary, Mary.  Okay, Mary.  All right, we'll play a little bit of another one from the album.  Ten Night Saints.  She was afraid to come out of the locker.  She was as nervous as she could be. 
[02:29:00]  She was afraid to come out of the locker.  She was afraid that somebody would see.  Three, four, tell the people what she thought.  It was a pixie, pixie, genie, reenie.  I told him this was a good idea.  Monroe.  Monroe.  Like William Shatner.  Yeah, yeah.  Like the William Shatner song.  It's just depressing.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm glad I'm dead.  She was afraid to come out of the locker.  He wrote this about Sandy Kane.  Is this the first time this has ever been on the radio?  I don't know.  I haven't heard this.  She said, godly love of the show.  Tell the people what she wants.  She wants.  It all started for me at a small 5,000 watt radio station in Fresno, California. 
[02:30:00]  And it ended for me doing this.  Spalding, back me up on this.  Lacey.  Lacey on the rocks.  Dance around.  It'll make it better.  Spalding, you'll get nothing like it. 
[02:30:30]  Sit down, Danny.  Huh?  How about a Fresca?  Oh, God.  This is terrible.  They spent their whole lives working in the cramps.  They could say that in like a 10-inch market.  It was an itsy-bitsy.  Teeny-weeny, yellow polka dot bikini.  In America.  She wore it in America. 
[02:31:00]  Today.  Today.  I was very nervous.  She was turning blue.  Blue, blue, blue.  There you go.  I think those backup singers were like guys Monroe made at the glory hole.  I hear they are.  You know what it is?  Coincidentally enough, the backup singers here, and we're on a road trip once with Sandy  Kane down in Florida.  The rest is history.  Yeah, they're called Morty and the Murphmakers. 
[02:31:30]  You like that itsy-bitsy bikini, don't you?  Let's bring in Sandy Kane.  Why'd you wear the bikini, you whore?  She was asking for it, Monroe.  So, me, the backup singers, Sandy, Sandy, get on the bed of the Motel 6.  Okay, Lou, you hold her down.  Murr, murr, grab her ankles.  They had a gun.  They had a gun.  Grab her ankles, murr.  They had a gun.  They had a gun on me, man.  I've got a gun.  I wish people had a gun.  Sandy Kane, I've got a gun.  Okay, it's a gun. 
[02:32:00]  I pull the trigger, it goes pop.  It's fun.  Right.  Finger pop, finger pop.  All right.  Get the lube, Lou.  I'm going to see Colin tomorrow night.  What are you doing later?  Tonight?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Let's finger pop.  Colin Quinn will be at Caroline's tomorrow night.  Let's exchange blood tests.  9.30.  All right, the same jokes every time you're in here.  She wore a little twaddle on her head.  Okay, pookie.  All right.  Let's hear the new song.  What do we have to do?  This is a tragic song. 
[02:32:30]  Yes.  But I couldn't keep him off the show, Asamo, because, you know, I do my own show.  I love the preface.  Public access, which is on tonight at 11 o'clock.  Uh-huh.  11 o'clock, change the part, lady.  1.30.  Yeah, 1.30.  T-I-X.  Warner Brothers.  Wow.  Hey, she's on a real stage.  She is.  You're right.  Cable access Warner Brothers.  Yeah.  You're right.  She's getting paid and I'm not.  That's a big one. 
[02:33:00]  Isn't it?  No.  You do like it.  Ow.  But, you know, not all of us are lucky.  Right, Dildo?  She talks to her.  I have no boyfriend.  A vibrator.  Hello, Dildo.  I think.  Hey, Warren.  Itchy-bitsy.  Teeny-weeny.  Dildo Lou.  Okay.  Monroe.  Get Mr. Dildo out of there, Monroe.  You can watch my show, I bet.  You can tell.  Yeah, all the time, Sandy.  All right.  You don't live in Manhattan, though, right?  You guys are out in Long Island.  You don't get me.  Yeah.  As far as you're concerned, I live on Long Island.  That's fine.  No, Brooklyn. 
[02:33:30]  No, Brooklyn.  No, Long Island's bad.  Long Island's all right.  Okay.  Kill yourself.  Opie Hughes lives in.  Greg Hughes lives in.  All right.  You know my real name.  Congratulations.  Greg, thank you.  Okay.  Now, I read about you a lot, guys.  You get a lot of press.  What do we have to do so you can sing your song?  Okay.  It's going to be a cappella.  Where's your music?  I'm going to sing my music with me.  What is this to?  All right.  Here we go.  My vibrator in my music.  What song is this to?  Is it a clean song?  If we have to dump out of you, I swear to God, we're going to... 
[02:34:00]  Clean or what?  You're showing me a poster of Osama bin Laden.  Right.  I wrote a song about it.  It's Wado.  I thought you guys would like it because I listened to you when this happened.  We have finally reached our tribute song quota.  Yeah.  I mean, you really gave me a lot of warmth and love that day when it happened.  You had no commercials on and it was beautiful.  It's like the beaten dog.  I was sitting in St. Patrick's listening to you.  All right.  And I was crying.  Yeah.  It was not an easy show to do there. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, I know.  But you gave a lot of people a lot of good things.  The people walking by St. Patrick's must have thought they just did an exorcism.  Be gone, dirty, filthy spirit.  You did a lot of good that day.  It was too big.  Then she came out, wow, it worked.  That must have been a tough battle.  What's going to happen with the dildo?  Oh, it just stays there.  No, wait.  It dances.  It dances.  Come on, dildo.  All right.  Here we go.  He likes her.  I know.  She's a song.  All right.  Go ahead.  Are you getting along with Lynn from Change of Heart now? 
[02:35:00]  God knows where that's been.  Change of Heart.  Can you say four?  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Change of Heart.  Can you say four?  Can you say four?  Can you say four?  Can you say four?  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  We're going to start.  Do your song.  Can you say four?  Here we go.  We're running out of show.  Let's go.  Who cares?  Oh.  I do.  I wish I had a.  I saw my old lady.  You want to kill us Americans dead.  Mama's dead.  Mama's dead.  I saw my old lady. 
[02:35:30]  You want to kill every American dead.  I had a dream last night.  I saw my ooh-ooh.  You said you wanted to kill me because I was a Jew.  But I saw my old lady.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Now, us Americans, we are going to kill you. 
[02:36:00]  Ooh, I saw my old lady.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  I saw my old lady.  I saw my old lady.  Ah!  We are going to kill you.  Ooh.  Oh, my.  I saw my old lady.  You're going to kill every American dead.  Oh, my.  I saw my old lady.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Last night I had a dream. 
[02:36:30]  It was about you.  I said, please don't kill me, Asamo.  I got to be with Opie and Anthony, too.  Ah, Asamo been laden.  You're going to kill everybody dead.  Oh, my.  I saw my old lady.  You're going to kill everybody dead.  I saw my old lady.  I saw my old lady. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, no.  You can't say that.  No, you can't say that.  Hey, wow, look at that.  That's a little bit laden song, and you can also hear it on my own show.  Who threw the chair?  Who threw the chair?  Oh, my God.  What are you, crazy?  Crazy people here.  It's a crazy show.  I love to throw things at Sammy as she tries to sing things.  What's wrong with Colin?  Colin, you're a good deal. 
[02:37:30]  I had Warner Brothers listening, and I can't.  Yeah, sure.  I'll be singing.  That was so sad for me.  You know, I just put garbage on her head.  It was like a spin on a carry.  Right, yeah.  Yeah.  I slipped.  You know?  You guys are gentle.  You slipped.  No, the other one hurt me, too, Ben.  Uh-oh, Ben.  You hate women, right?  Ben does hate women.  You're right, Sandy.  You're right, Sandy.  A motel rape in 1970.  No, I mean, he hates women. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, man.  Yes.  I just broke my arm.  Sandy, you're right.  Ben does hate women.  Yes, I did tell you.  And he's Jewish, too, like the, uh...  No, by injection.  By injection.  You've got to see the woman from Warner Brothers.  By rejection.  She is so disgusting.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  He really hates this.  That wasn't Neil Diamond that took you down to Florida.  Was it?  No, he was there when I got there.  Hey, you're getting your, uh, rave reviews, uh, over the song.  Yeah.  Yeah, rave reviews.  People are loving it, Sandy.  Yes.  Uh, thank you, man.  As I got, and that, you know...  So you're going to bring a doctor, right?  Why, what happened? 
[02:38:30]  My arm...  We're going to bring a doctor about, uh, Twato.  As long as he didn't hear Twato.  And don't hear Twato.  I didn't break your nose.  You're all right.  My poor dildo is on the floor.  West Coast Dave saying it's better than, uh, Gonna Get You by Dr. Dirty.  John Valby.  That song.  Ooh.  All right.  What am I saying?  See, you're getting rave reviews.  Uh.  Someone, uh, Christian saying, please dump a bucket of AIDS over her head.  Well, that's, that's promising.  That's a promising review.  I need a tape of that horrible voice in case I need to induce vomiting. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Poor dildo.  She makes me wish he had gotten her, I guess, uh, Osama.  Someone's writing in they'd rather snort anthrax, so, uh...  Good.  Sandy, can you sing the insects will get you?  How come I never get your humor, man?  Because you're stupid.  I just can't.  Yeah, that's probably true.  That's true.  All right.  We have to take a break.  We'll come back, and we'll close this mess.  Under my legs.  Sandy Kane, everyone. 
[02:39:30]  Thank you very much.  She's on at 11 o'clock, change-up heart lady.  So you're going to bring a gynecologist the next time, right?  All right.  And Colin Quinn playing Caroline's tomorrow night at 9.30.  I'll be there.  We'll be back.  See you until we'll come.  Let them hang.  Let them hang like the animals they are.  What a day, what a day, what a day. 
[02:40:00]  We got lots of great pictures up on OpieandAnthony.com from all the guests that were in the studio  today, including Colin Quinn hugging the lovely stripper from Double D's.  Yeah.  I think Colin had a favorite in that group of three girls.  She's the one that liked McDonald's.  Right.  I like McDonald's.  It's the brightest bulb in the pack.  That was great.  And we have Lynn from Change of Heart, the new host.  You guys, you know what?  I'm really upset about what Sandy said about my body since I just saw, I went to the bathroom 
[02:40:30]  and came back and saw, what's worse than Sandy coming is Sandy going.  Oh, yeah.  That ass that is.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So go to OpieandAnthony.com.  Some of the girls enter the booboo lantern contest.  Uh-oh.  Here she goes.  What?  You're it?  It's flawless.  Really?  It looks great.  Flawless.  You know, I look at myself in the back.  Sandy's ass looks like William Frawley.  Hey, Rick.  Finally got a joke.  Thank you. 
[02:41:00]  A William Frawley joke.  That I know, man.  She gets a William Frawley joke.  Thank God he's working commercially.  Desi Ones here.  Oh, and on FoundryMusic.com, the poll is up.  You have to decide who's hot, or Sandy Cain, or Lynn, the new host of Change of Heart.  You know, I am getting really disturbed by some of these pictures.  The link to FoundryMusic.com is on OpieandAnthony.com.  Huh?  I said I'm taking my own life if I don't win.  Where's the actual poll, though?  That's just a picture? 
[02:41:30]  They'll figure it out for later.  That's a good picture.  I'm sure men that like real women.  I mean, real.  What?  Real women and, you know.  What does real women have to do with you?  Maybe she made a lot like me.  A lot of men would like better than her.  What?  Hold on.  What planet?  A lot of men is a VFW.  Yeah.  What planet are you talking?  There's a blind guy that lives in my building that would.  Yeah, exactly.  Are you serious when you say that?  There are men.  There are men.  I mean, I do.  There are men that would rather be with you physically than be with her. 
[02:42:00]  Yes, definitely.  Stop it.  Especially men that like double-D breasts that are real, not implants.  No, no, double-D.  Don't even start.  The indented, nippy thing.  What's wrong with indented?  The sagness.  What's that mean?  The E.T. version of the abdomen.  Some men love breasts.  Sandy.  Sandy.  They could be the ugliest thing in the world, but they love breasts.  They're being delusional.  Colin, am I right?  Not those.  Well, Colin, we're waiting.  They wore breasts down the street.  Sandy, not those.  You've got to understand something.  What's wrong with my breasts? 
[02:42:30]  I made my money my whole life with these.  These are my bread and butters, man.  Yeah, it's kind of retirement.  Sandy, you've got those indented things.  What's wrong with indented headphones?  They're monstrous.  I don't know what they are.  I'd light them on fire.  It's a great gimmick, man.  People love it.  Your breasts look like wet bags of horse faces.  It's me.  What's up?  Too much crap happened today.  Look at this picture.  I know. 
[02:43:00]  That's the Sandy Patty picture in the hot stripper outfit.  And the same hot stripper outfit that the stripper was wearing.  And the pictures are side by side.  Doesn't Patty look like you were in that picture?  She looks like Ben Kingsley.  Ben Kingsley, Joe.  Ben Kingsley.  Nice.  Yul Brynner.  All right.  Let's go to the phones here and see what people learn today.  Ryan.  Ryan, what's up?  Ryan.  What's up, boys?  Hey, try to get in, man.  What's up?  Hey, I learned that I would rather fish for pennies at the bottom of a bowl full of razor blades 
[02:43:30]  than listen to Ted Knight or Sandy Cain sing a song.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Ryan.  Be good, boys.  Bye.  Some great pictures up.

He's a very funny comic.  Okay, we just don't know. 
[02:44:30]  And you're opening for him, or did you just blurt that out, Sandy?  You're not.  No, I know Bill Michaels.  He put me...  He said, you know...  But you're not opening for anybody, are you?  No, I'm not opening.  I'm just doing a show.  She's on at 6 p.m.  At November 10th.  She's getting there before the...

[02:45:00]  Wow.  Could you imagine?  There go the radio.  There go the radio.  Dream dates.  That would be funny, though.  You're thinking about breaking up with your girlfriend, so you go out on a date with Sandy.  Lynn is asking for it.  Sandy's ready to go gun it for me.  Oh, yeah.  Well, how about you just rig it up with the guy that that's the girl that he brings out  in front of his girlfriend?  Exactly.  So the girl's sitting there, and let's bring out your date, and she walks out, and you  just watch the girlfriend's face.  Like, freak out that the boyfriend went out with Sandy.  I think Sandy would be a good time, though. 
[02:45:30]  You'd be fine, wouldn't you?  I've done a lot of TV.  I did Moral Court and Immoral Court.  Moral Court.  Moral Court.  Moral Court on Court TV, and I did...  No, Moral Court was on Channel 9.  I did Court TV.  Oh, well, how about that?  I did Richard Bay.  I did Charles Perez.  Oh, Richard Bay.  Wow.  That's Richard Bay's problem now.  Wow.  Look at that.  Is that where that itching and chafing is coming from?  Richard Bay happens to be a very nice guy.  Of course, yes.  Right.  Hey, Patty, Colin Quinn has a surprise for you.  Patty, I understand you're looking for money for tonight's gig. 
[02:46:00]  I'd like to give you this 50, and my Metro car has got 1250 on it.  Wow.  There you go.  Thank you.  Don't feel obliged to perform any sexual acts on me.  Oh, no.  Patty, I can spot you 100 here.  So is that good?  Oh, that's good.  Well, you know, don't get too close.  Just take the money and get away from me.  And, of course, the same thing I said to the hooker.  I'm showing my twaddle.  Take the money and get away from me.  Nothing from me.  No, no.

Colin Quinn of Caroline's.  Tomorrow night at 9.30.  Colin, it's always a pleasure.  Thank you.  Have your time, Colin.  I love that. </pre>
