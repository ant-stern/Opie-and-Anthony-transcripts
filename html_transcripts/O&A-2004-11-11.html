<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an extended play of their intro music, followed by a discussion of a grueling Channel 9 News interview. The hosts, Opie and Anthony, recounted the interview's focus on the infamous "Sex for Sam" incident from two years and four months prior, overshadowing promotion for their upcoming "Passion of O&A" comedy festival. They also mocked the interviewer's bizarre word association game.  The conversation then veered into the hosts' erratic sleep schedules and lifestyles since leaving their afternoon slot, including anecdotes about their producer Ben's surprise at Jim's unexpected day off and speculation about Jim's late-night activities.

A significant portion of the show detailed Opie's heated confrontation with Eric, their ex-convict building security guard, over spilled coffee and a malfunctioning security card. This escalated into a shouting match filled with insults and threats.  The fallout from the "Sex for Sam" stunt was also revisited, specifically focusing on a restaurant owner’s dinner honoring Jim Cook of Boston Beer Company, despite continued objections from John Mahan, who remained upset about the stunt.  Opie and Anthony defended Cook's lack of direct involvement. A phone call with a seemingly confused listener, Glenn, followed, evolving into a planned comedic bit.

A substantial prank call segment, orchestrated with the help of staffer "Sex Bagel" Eric, involved tricking a "huge Tony Danza fan," Joan, into believing she'd meet Tony Danza (played by Anthony).  The fake Danza's interaction with Joan became sexually suggestive. The show concluded this segment with speculation about whether Joan would follow through with the prank at the actual Tony Danza show. Brief mentions of Liza Minnelli and Yasser Arafat's death were included, along with final riffing on the "projects" and a closing call to action.

A subsequent chaotic segment featured a studio visit from "Master Poe," who delivered cleaning supplies. The show was plagued by technical difficulties, forcing the hosts to use AOL Instant Messenger to manage phone calls.  This segment included discussions of "private views," Ozzy Osbourne’s call announcing his impending divorce from Sharon Osbourne (with details of the divorce discussed), and a failed karate demonstration by Rich Voss, analyzed by Master Poe and contrasted with Nathaniel's jiu-jitsu expertise.  Ozzy Osbourne's divorce was the most serious topic covered in this part.

A rambling discussion followed, beginning with a conversation about martial arts, including high kicks and groin kicks, and a humorous anecdote about a front kick to someone’s chin.  The conversation transitioned to a party anecdote mentioning Sam Champion, and a discussion of the hosts' perceived lack of fame. Master Poe then gave a violent and intense self-defense demonstration with his student, Marcelino, described graphically by the hosts.  Marcelino appeared to be in pain at the end. The hosts compared themselves to Master Poe and Marcelino physically, and recounted past studio altercations.  This led to stories about Master Poe’s dog and a comparison of their comedy careers to John Heffron’s.  A musical recording of *The Silence of the Lambs* with graphic, sexually suggestive lyrics was played. The segment continued with more discussion of Master Poe and the hosts’ insecurities around physically imposing people, and anecdotes about past drug use, including a car crash and Voss's decision to seek help for substance abuse. The hosts also discussed a reality TV show they appeared on, Voss’s career, various alcoholic beverages, and foods named after comedians, with Martini Steve mentioned as being present in the studio for some of this.

A guest segment featured Rich Vos and John Heffron. Vos shared detailed accounts of his past drug use, including cocaine and heroin, risky drug encounters, and his recovery.  He described specific incidents involving procuring drugs and how his drug use affected a performance, and even detailed a method for processing cocaine. He also discussed his gambling addiction and experiences with other comedians, including David Spade and the deceased Frankie Bastille.  Heffron shared his own experiences, including a physical altercation with another comedian and anecdotes about working with other comedians.  The conversation touched on a roast Vos attended, a lawsuit against Liza Minnelli, and the difficulties of stand-up comedy. Listener phone calls, promotional announcements for Heffron’s appearances at Caroline's, and advertisements for XM Satellite Radio and Rich Vos's DVD were included.  The conversation included several jokes and a humorous exchange about mispronouncing "Worcester."  The segment concluded with more discussion of Vos's recovery and his experiences in comedy.  The conversation throughout this segment was filled with vulgar and offensive language.

The final segment began with an offensive interaction with a caller described as a "gay landscaper."  A recurring bit involved a pungent odor from one host’s ear, described as smelling like grape jelly and rotting flesh.  Multiple studio guests, including John Heffron, reacted to the smell, later revealed to be residue from a past cyst.  The conversation shifted to politics, with vulgar and offensive remarks about George W. Bush, John Kerry, Jeb Bush, and Rudy Giuliani.  Further segments included an absurd bit about a world without vibrators and a jaywalking ticket.  A "Fresh Grocer" offered a tip about shallots.  John Heffron’s upcoming shows were mentioned, along with a news item about comedians substituting as teachers, leading to speculation about which comedians were involved. A caller described a power tool with a dildo attached. The show ended with an audio clip of a woman using a sex toy and various crude jokes and banter.

[00:06:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What happened?  My headphones weren't on.  Oh, there you go.  Now they is.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Getting more gooder every day, right, Anthony?  More gooder.  I got to start the show by saying I'm so sick of that sweeper that starts this radio show.  Oh, God.  It finally hit me.  I think you can recite every word of it.  Most people go to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray. 
[00:06:30]  Well, one couple, shut up, to pray.  Hey, Opie and Anthony, that happened two years and four months ago, and we're still talking about it.  I know, enough.  We did an interview with Channel 9 News here in New York City.  It's going to be on tonight at, I don't know, 10 o'clock or in the 10 o'clock hour.  Once again, you can see what wrecks we are after the show.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  They put us against the wall.  It's like a firing squad.  And it's after the show.  We're exhausted.  We're pretty much leaning on the wall to help us out.  And there they are, rolling tape and asking us questions that we've answered a thousand times.  We really thought it was going to be about the comedy festival that's happening in New York City.  We're doing The Passion of O&A at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Saturday here in New York City.  The Passion of the O&A.  It should have been The Passion of the O&A.  I told Pete that.  You did.  Of course I did. 
[00:07:30]  Of course you did.  The Passion of the O&A has to be, as in be Christ.  I know.  That's funny.  The Passion of the O&A.  Like it's something different than we are.  Yeah.  So she asked one question about the festival.  Yeah.  And then went right back into the Sex for Sam thing.  Sex for Sam.  I think we've answered every question about that stupid, stupid thing.  What you could do on XM Satellite Radio that you can't do on regular radio.  It's like, you know, she's a very nice woman, but...  Pat Collins.  The fact of the matter is we've answered those questions before. 
[00:08:00]  Many, many, many times before.  And we really thought this was going to be just a different interview about the new show.  Although the word association thing was a little different.  A little wacky.  I don't know what that was about.  Wacky.  She actually tooted the wacky horn.  Yeah, she did.  Word association.  I know.  John Kerry.  Frankenstein.  Like, what the fuck?  Word association.  I guess it's a bitch she does on the 10 o'clock news.  I don't know.  So that's on tonight. 
[00:08:30]  And we'll play the audio tomorrow on the show.  What the hell?  Of course we will.  And it'll be the same audio you've heard a million times on all the other interviews.  Wow, time's going by really fast today.  Our clock here in the studio is going about.  It's already 8.30 and quickly going to 8.35.  The second hand spins around the entire dial in one second.  I'm getting dizzy.  It looks like a time lapse moment from the Twilight Zone when they would try to fast forward all day.  The clock's spinning.  Yeah, yeah.  I almost didn't get the Twilight Zone out. 
[00:09:00]  Fat nothing.  Hey, I'm all for the show going by this fast.  It's almost 9 o'clock.  There you go.  Ready to rock.  Get ready to pack up.  We're almost out of here.  Man.  I know you're sleepy, Jim, because it was your day off today.  Oh, I got him good.  This is now turning into something, I think.  Ben comes running in about five minutes, ten minutes before the show.  He just almost fell off his chair.  Ben, you're a wreck.  And I actually went to bed really early last night. 
[00:09:30]  I went to bed about seven.  Maybe that's it.  No.  So Ben comes running in and goes, it's Jimmy's day off today?  And we're like, what?  He goes, yeah, it's his day off.  He didn't say anything yesterday that he was taking a, and in mid-sentence, he goes, he didn't say anything yesterday.  He was taking a, he got me again!  And, you know, two minutes later, Jim comes strolling through the door, going, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Freaking Ben out.  I should have known better, because we talked about something we were going to do today.  Of course you should have known better.  And then I'm like, why the hell would he be up if he's, you know, but then again, Jim could be up, because he could be trolling for hookers on the internet. 
[00:10:00]  But I was like, oh, two days in a row.  That was very funny.  Any hookers last night, Jimmy?  No, I actually went to that New York Comedy Festival party.  Yeah, Voss calls me.  He goes, are you going to the party tonight?  I'm like, what time does it start?  Eleven.  Eleven?  Eleven.  That's like the middle of the night for us now.  I walk around my neighborhood at eight o'clock, going, why is everyone still awake?  I know.  Isn't it awful?  Why is everyone up?  Don't they understand? 
[00:10:30]  They got to go to bed soon.  Seven-thirty to me feels like midnight.  Yeah.  Like it used to feel at midnight.  You can feel a time of day.  You really can.  If you're up at three in the morning, you just have that feeling that it's three in the morning.  Now it's seven-thirty at night.  I'm like, wow, it's like that one a.m. feel to it.  Yeah.  And it's just awful.  There's a lot of action, a lot of people walking around, going in and out of restaurants and bars and taxis.  And I'm thinking, this is crazy.  Yeah.  We have nothing to drink in the house. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Like I like having, you know, a little club soda in the fridge when you wake up at night, get that dry mouth gone.  And I was going to run to the store.  And then I looked at the clock and it was almost seven o'clock.  I'm like, oh, I can't go in now.  It's like the middle of the night.  Middle of the night.  How could I jump in the, you know, I'm in my jammies.  How could I jump in the truck and take off to a store?  It wouldn't even be open.  It's so late.  We say it pretty much every morning, but our lives are pretty pathetic right now.  This isn't the Opie and Anthony I remember. 
[00:11:30]  No.  Coming off of afternoons, doing afternoons on the air, and then with two years of having nothing to do, you just make your own schedule.  It didn't matter.  There were no alarm clocks.  You just woke up, looked at the clock, and went, oh, that's the time it is?  If I felt like rolling out of bed, I would.  If I felt like another hour's sleep, I'm fine.  Now it's, you know, oh, here it is, four in the morning.  Great, great.  Time to rise and shine.  Oh, I like a nice early morning on a nice brisk day.  You know, it wakes you up, invigorates you. 
[00:12:00]  No.  And you're an ass.  You came in with your, like, full winter gear.  Don't you understand it's going to be, like, 60 today here in New York City?  The stupid asshole on 1010 Winds today screwed up on his weather forecast.  He's like, and today is...  Venom has fell on his chair.  It's just fine.  Just be careful.  Oh, that is hysterical.  Just get rid of the chair, man.  The guy on Winds goes, it's 42 degrees going down to 38 today in Manhattan.  I'm like, oh, 38. 
[00:12:30]  Okay, I'll get my big friggin' Eskimo parka out and my scarf and pull the hood over my head.  I hope he's making fun of me when we're leaving the studio yesterday.  I pull the hood up when we leave the elevator, and I, like, I put the scarf around my mouth,  and I'm ready to go outside.  He's like, dude.  And I cut him off.  I go, I don't even want to hear what I look like.  Well, it's just...  Because I don't care.  It was cold, but you're dressed like it's single digits.  I hate the cold.  I don't even care when it's marginally cold.  Keeping you awake there, Jimmy?  Oh, man, I got like an hour and a half. 
[00:13:00]  You yawn into the mic.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And you got the hour and a half sleep because you went to the kickoff party for the festival.  Yeah.  See, I showed responsibility.  I went home.  It's not responsibility.  It's necessity.  Actually, I had no choice.  There's no way.  Because I'm not like Ben or Jimmy or yourself, Anthony.  I need my sleep, or I just cannot function whatsoever.  Me?  I don't do anything anymore.  But I go home.  But if you were up all night, you could pull it off easily.  Easily.  Yeah, one day. 
[00:13:30]  I'm the worst if I don't get the sleep.  I can't string them together anymore.  And then I walk in at 5 a.m., and I have a huge fight with the ex-convict downstairs.  Huge dude.  Yeah, I hear you had a little tiff with him this morning.  Not even a little this time.  As long as your papers are in order, he is fine.  If your papers are in order, you don't have the proper credentials to enter the building.  We have this love-hate relationship.  Some mornings, it's like, hey, how are you?  And other mornings, we go right at it.  Isn't he, like, cheery sometimes? 
[00:14:00]  Sometimes.  He goes, morning, and he's like, hey, how you doing?  And you walk past him, and you go about your business.  What's up, Eric?  Remember yesterday when we were in that elevator, and there was coffee all over the floor?  Yeah.  Well, a little later in the program, Jim was talking about not having a bowl for cereal.  So I ran downstairs to go get him a bowl.  Thank you.  As I'm walking out, he comes in.  He goes, you, you, come here, come here, come here.  Yeah?  He goes, you guys, when you came in this morning, you dropped your coffee all over the damn floor of the elevator,  and you don't even clean it up and tell anybody, and I got to take care of that. 
[00:14:30]  I said, that was on the floor before we came in.  I said, this wasn't the interns doing the coffee run.  I said, this was there before we got it.  Well, we don't know that.  I know that.  It was on the floor, and he said, all right, well, then I'll take care of it.  I was like, you're such a dick.  It was so obvious that it was Ben's coffee.  Yeah.  Because I saw the ice cubes, and Ben likes his iced coffee in the morning.  And so when I walked in the elevator, and I saw that the coffee was all over the elevator,  and there was little ice cubes that still haven't melted, I'm like, freaking Ben with his herky-jerky. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, herky-jerky, his coffee flying.  He's got his iced coffee in one hand, herky-ing and jerky-ing, and the other, he's trying to keep his hair under control,  and he's trying to hit the elevator.  Swipe the car.  Yeah, swipe the car and hit the elevator with his knee.  I'm like, it was just a disaster waiting to happen.  And you lost it.  It was your coffee, right?  Well, it was because my idiot friend, Tim Collins, decided to call me from Mexico at 5 o'clock in the morning  when I was coming to work to tell me he was still up.  And after all that, he's then accepting a phone call. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I got a phone call, and he just spills it to the side.  And that's what happened.  And the funny thing was, it dropped, and it echoed so loud, and I didn't know how he didn't hear it.  I could hear him coming, so I was hitting the button to close the elevator door.  Because you know what?  I'm not going to lie to you.  We're all kind of scared of the guy.  He's like an ex-convict, and he looks like he could snap at any moment.  And I go right at him this morning, which was just stupid.  Why'd he give you a bunk?  Well, I have this, you know, the security card that we all have.  The security card doesn't work.  So my security card doesn't work in the elevator, because you have to swipe it so you can come upstairs. 
[00:16:00]  So I go marching back to the desk, and I'm like, oh, here comes the problem.  Did you march?  I marched.  And I go, uh, just casually, I'm like, you know, you've got to, like, buzz me up.  My security card's not working.  Casually.  And you knew what was coming.  I know, because I was trying to downplay it, because I know this guy, we've talked about this guy.  This guy had the easiest job in New York City.  He's a security guard in a building that gets no action, where no one even comes to work until 7, 8 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah, it's not like the Fox News thing, where there's lines of people that have to be checked out all the time. 
[00:16:30]  Remember when we went in there?  Yeah.  The security people there, it's lines of people that they have to check the IDs, call upstairs to confirm that people are coming.  That's a real security guy at a real building.  This guy down there, half the time he's drinking in the back room, and the other half, he's up at the front desk, hassling the people that work here.  Do we know that he's drinking in the back room?  I assume he is.  Oh, all right.  But basically, he was able to sleep on the job, is what I'm getting at.  Yeah.  You know, and now he has to be up every morning at 4.30 to let us all in. 
[00:17:00]  And it pisses him off.  Oh, it pisses him off.  So he's just on edge and just waiting for a problem every morning.  So today's problem, I go, dude, my car's not letting me go upstairs in the elevator.  Trying to sneak past it.  Hey, buddy pal.  Yeah, this ain't weird.  No, I'm like, I'm just shaking inside, because I just know it's going to be a problem.  It's way too early for this crap.  He goes, I thought I told you to take care of that car last week.  Look, you.  You better have your fucking car, you cocksucker.  Yeah, yellow belly bastard. 
[00:17:30]  You yellow belly.  Why don't you come down here with the proper car?  I'll show you.  I'll cut Z's in your cheek.  Yeah.  You yellow belly.  You mother sucks, cock, yeah.  He kind of reminds me of that guy.  I know.  Reminds me of red.  So I go, you didn't tell me to take care of my car last week.  I told you I lost my car, because that was last week's problem.  I go, I have a new car, it doesn't work.  Well, you better go take care of that, because I can't be.  I'm not allowed to buzz you up.  Not allowed. 
[00:18:00]  Technically, I'm not allowed to let you up, so I'm doing you a favor.  So I start yelling at him, right?  You owe me.  I go, and then all of a sudden he goes, let's not get excited here.  I go, not get excited?  You're getting excited.  He's ready to jump on.  And then we're like, no, I mean, we are nose to nose, and I'm like, oh my god, we might  have to fight.  Did you smell booze?  No, I didn't smell booze.  That's why I'm not sure about the drinking in the back thing.  Were you both getting excited together?  It was awful, dude.  It was so uncomfortable.  Why you?  And then he goes, I'll do it this time, and you take care of that card. 
[00:18:30]  Now what's going to happen tomorrow?  I go, look who's raising his voice now.  And he looks at me.  I swear he wanted to swing at me.  I swear to you.  Now, what do you do tomorrow?  Because I know you.  You are not getting that card fake.  No, I want to play this out.  See what happens.  Of course you do.  I love playing this stuff out.  Now you're going to come in tomorrow.  Your adrenaline's going to be pumped because you know it's coming.  Yeah.  By the way, I just love how Eric came to the defense of our show about the coffee spilt  in the elevator. 
[00:19:00]  Did he honestly think it wasn't anyone from this show's coffee?  Yeah, Eric, who else's coffee could it have been?  At four in the morning or whatever the hell it is.  He was blaming you and me specifically.  He doesn't like.  He's got a problem with Opie anyway.  I've come to that realization.  He doesn't like you.  Yeah, because I confront him.  I confront people.  You're the one who's like, he's a nice guy.  You're like, oh, he's all right.  Yeah, like pull some tape from a few weeks back and Opie will say, I like him now.  And we're like, the guy's a prick.  You don't have to pull the tape.  I'll tell you.  We started off as a problem and then there was a week or two there where it was like, 
[00:19:30]  hey, hi.  Because we confronted each other.  I think he respected the fact that I confronted him.  Uh-huh.  Because I like confronting people.  And then now we're back to having a huge problem.  I mean, this is a huge problem.  Well, we had a problem when he was locking the door in the front of the building where we  used to have to lay on the bell.  Right.  And he would get pissed off because I would hold it down until I saw him start, you know,  swaying down the hallway.  And he would be like, you don't have to hold it that long.  I could be on the 10th floor and I have to come down. 
[00:20:00]  You wouldn't hear the bell on the 10th floor, jackass.  Yeah.  So I hold it down so someone comes up here and opens the door.  But I like the fact that Eric is sticking up for the show.  But I just know.  Look, man.  Not our coffee, man.  I saw the coffee in the elevator.  I just started laughing because I knew exactly whose coffee it was.  Herky Ben.  There was no doubt in my mind.  So.  All right.  Well, we have a busy show today.  What a mess.  Rich Voss is coming in with John Heffron?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, very cool.  And Brian Regan on the phone, Anthony.  Speaking of two years and four months ago. 
[00:20:30]  That's right.  He was our last guest on our last program at WNAW, right?  He was on the only show we did after Sex for Sam.  That's right.  They actually put us on the air the day after Sex for Sam.  Really fast.  Speaking of Sex for Sam, you read about this ass, this restaurant owner that is still.  Oh, I thought you meant Opie and Anthony.  Well, we know where ass is.  Trust me.  We'll be the first to tell you where ass is.  But this ass is still holding it against Jim Cook and Sam Adams about the Sex for Sam thing. 
[00:21:00]  And you know what?  Jim Cook had nothing to do with this thing.  He absolutely had nothing to do with this.  You know what Jim Cook is?  He's like the figurehead guy.  He's like the guy that used to hawk for Wendy's, you know?  You think the guy that hawked for Wendy's was in there cooking the burgers?  No.  Of course not.  Dave Thomas?  Dave Thomas.  He owned it, didn't he?  I don't know what he was.  Did he own it?  Yeah.  It's a franchise, I thought. 
[00:21:30]  But wasn't it a franchise?  He wasn't there cooking the burgers?  But he was at one point.  Don't you contradict me.  I think I'm with Anthony on this.  He may have owned it at one point, but then he was just kind of the figurehead.  Jim Cook invented Sam Adams beer.  Jim Cook actually came up with the whole Sam Adams thing, but he's not really the principal owner anymore.  He's like the face in front of the beer.  Right.  You'd think of that, but behind the scenes, there's a whole corporation running the show.  Right.  Not your show, Elias. 
[00:22:00]  So, Anthony, read a little bit of this.  The sin in the cathedral is coming back to haunt Sam Adams.  It's casting a long shadow over a dinner in New York tonight for bar and restaurant owners.  The organizers of the dinner see it as a storm in a beer mug.  But some members of the United Restaurant and Tavern Owners of New York City are crying foul.  The U-R-T-O.  Is this really an important organization? 
[00:22:30]  Well, we'll tonight honor Boston Beer Company co-founder Jim Cook at its annual dinner.  But not every member of U-R-T-O will be showing up at the Grand Hyatt for cocktails, suds, and a hearty dinner.  One among them is John Mahan.  Yeah.  John Mahan, owner of some of the city's best-known hoistleries.  Hostleries?  Hostleries.  Yeah.  Well, why don't they just say bars? 
[00:23:00]  Because that would be easy.  Including, um...  Let's try not to show our intelligence in news articles.  Langan's, the Pig and Whistle, and P.J. Moran's.  In a letter to Urto, Moen says the organization had no business honoring Cook as a result of a stunt in St. Patrick's Cathedral two years ago that caused a nationwide uproar.  Nationwide uproar.  The stunt involved a couple having sex in a confession box.  In St. Patrick's? 
[00:23:30]  Who did that?  A confession box.  In a confession box?  I love the fact that they get this wrong over and over again.  Now they're saying the sex was in a confession box at St. Pat's?  Yes.  In a confession box in St. Pat's as part of a radio broadcast, Sex for Sam, a reference to the popular beer brewed by Cook's Company.  A confession box.  Wow, this is the first I've seen this.  The contest was broadcast on August 15, 2002 on the Opie and Anthony show on N.E.W. 
[00:24:00]  The resulting uproar sparked a boycott of Boston beer by bar owners in Boston and New York.  Shock jocks Opie and Anthony were fire.  Were fire.  Were canceled.  You're fire.  You're fire.  We're fire.  Fire.  The radio station was fined by the Federal Communications Commission.  And Cook scrambled to apologize, Waddle Doodle, in newspapers including the Irish Echo. 
[00:24:30]  Can I have another drink?  Another drink?  That's an Irish Echo.  One of the participants in the cathedral stunt, Brian Florence of Virginia, died of a heart attack a year after his escapade.  Now more than two years later, some feel that it's still too early to entirely forgive and forget.  In a letter to Erto, Mayen said that it's still unclear as to what Cook had hoped to accomplish in a promotion that led to a sacrilegious stunt and defilement of St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[00:25:00]  Erto had no business encouraging Mr. James Cook in this tasteless behavior and preposterous attack on our town, much less honoring him.  Town?  Yeah, town.  Yeah.  The New York town.  Yeah, town.  Cardinal Egan should denounce your decision from the pulpit, he concluded.  Oh, there's more.  I'm very strong.  I feel very strongly about this, Mayen said.  St. Pat's is very important to me, he said. 
[00:25:30]  It gave me strength.  Mayen described how as a newcomer to the bar and restaurant business in the 70s, he had spent a considerable amount of time in St. Pat's seeking solace as his finances hit hard times.  There you go.  He attributed much of his latest success to the time he had spent at the cathedral and the inspiration drawn from within its walls.  Well, obviously, he didn't get any of that forgive and forget kind of inspiration from the church.  That the Catholics are known for.  Sure. 
[00:26:00]  Mayen said that he would not attend the dinner.  I'm staying home.  It's understood that Mayen will not be the only ERTO member that will be absent from the dinner.  But 400 guests are still expected to attend.  And blah, blah, blah.  That's pretty much it.  Obviously, he made a mistake and some have not forgiven and forgotten and still object.  We admit some people might disagree with what we're doing, but we're a democratic organization and have the right to object. 
[00:26:30]  That's from this guy, Nolan, who's, I guess, head of the ERTO.  And they have a quote from Cook here.  Cook has said he felt humbled and made it clear that he was still feeling sorry over what happened in St. Pat's.  I'm humbled and still feeling sorry.  And Cook has made amends over the last couple of years, not just in apparent ways, but in other ways that the public did not know about.  I've made amends and a great winter brew.  You know, Jim Cook is a great guy. 
[00:27:00]  I still consider him a friend.  He called us after we got fired.  Not a bad bone in his body.  Said he still loved us and it was an unfortunate situation that happened.  And, you know, the fact is, Jim Cook had nothing to do with the Sam Adams thing, you know, or the Sex for Sam thing, I should say.  No.  Nothing.  He came in with beer.  We did the thing.  And it got ugly that day.  He didn't know what was going to happen that day.  Here's what Jim Cook's responsibility was as far as that promotion went.  He came up to us and said, we have a trip to come up to Boston, a party that we have at the brewery. 
[00:27:30]  Here it is for a couple of your listeners.  And then we decide how we're going to give that trip away.  That's all.  And we decided to do the Sex for Sam thing.  It wasn't Jim Cook saying, yeah, let's go to the confession box.  He had nothing to do with it.  But he came in with a great attitude, fun loving, you know, he had his beer.  Always having fun.  And thought he was just going to have fun with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:28:00]  He had no idea that it was going to go that way.  Of course not.  He had no idea that a couple was going to end up in a church.  He had nothing to do with the promotion.  And these guys are still hounding the poor guy.  What do you expect from a bunch of Catholics?  What do you expect?  That's what they do.  There's no forgiveness or honesty in what they're talking about.  Exactly.  Guilty.  Bless me, Father Frederson.  Ugh.  Fuck you.  You're the guy alone.  I prayed in St. Pat's.  That's how my shitty tavern business came back. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, that's a little odd.  That's what this guy is saying.  What's the matter?  The food?  The food was getting a little expensive.  Or you weren't selling enough booze.  So you went and said a few prayers.  Then you sold some booze.  Some guy went home and beat his wife.  You fucking idiots in Boston.  That's what annoys me.  They protested Jim Cook for the sex for Sam.  How about protesting alcohol because of, what, 90,000 highway deaths a year it causes?  That doesn't seem to bother you, you fucking scumbag bartenders.  But he prayed, so he would, uh...  Now he's better.  It's okay.  He was praying for money.  He was actually praying for money.  When that all went down, the Boston Herald had a front page of a tavern owner just dumping 
[00:29:00]  his St. Adams down the sink.  Yeah.  Did you see that picture?  I won't serve this here.  Well, Jim had nothing to do with it.  Someone will have to drink something else before they mow down a child.  Boy, those bartenders, they really got together.  Well, they should have done their research.  They would have realized that Cook really didn't have much to do with it.  I won't serve it in my bar.  I'm not serving it in my bar.  Want some scotch? 
[00:29:30]  Just sickening.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I'm staying home.  But 400 people were there to honor Jim Cook.  Hey, Glenn, in New Mexico.  What's going on?  Hey, Glenn.  You can eat my ass with a fucking spoon, all right there, Glenn?  What?  With a spoon.  What's your name, sir?  My name is Glenn.  All right.  So I said, what's up, Glenn? 
[00:30:00]  You're on the radio.  What's up, Glenn?  Hey, listen to him.  Hey, what's up, Glenn?  Listen to him listening to himself on the radio.  He's listening to the delay.  Glenn.  And is he talking back to it?  Yes, he is.  Glenn.  Glenn.  Glenn.  Glenn.  Glenn.  You fucking stupid cock.  You idiot.  You're talking to the radio.  You jack off. 
[00:30:30]  Can I tune in the radio?  Glenn, you asshole.  What do you have for the radio show?  Does someone have a gun?  Because I have to shoot myself.  Glenn.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Well, no, no.  You don't understand.  Glenn's wacky guy.  Are you trying to be...  Are you trying to do it a bit?  Yeah.  He's wacky guy.  He's a guy who doesn't get it on the phone today.  Glenn, are you trying to do a bit?  Is he playing that character?  Of course he is.  I don't get it, guy.  He couldn't be this stupid.  Glenn.  No one could be.  We just want to know...  Oh, there you go. 
[00:31:00]  That's what it was.  Wow.  Wacky guy.  I'm so glad.  It's 1994.  Thanks, Glenn, for reminding me of the year.  Why didn't you slip in a baba buoy?  Let's get out of here so I can go home and watch Seinfeld.  You know what?  That doesn't make sense, though, because he's paying to listen to our show.  What an idiot.  Thank you.  If Howard rules, go listen to him.  He's free.  You have to pay for us, and you are paying for us, you ass. 
[00:31:30]  That's pretty funny, the character, though, when he's repeating it.  Wacky.  I don't get it.  I'm listening to the delay on the radio guy.  I like that character.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break, and we're going to start the radio show in a few minutes here.  Actually, you know what I want to do?  Instead of going down to Washington and playing some old comedy bit, why don't we play the Tony Danza thing from yesterday?  Tony Danza?  The Tony Danza thing from yesterday.  Yes.  Another rube.  We got another rube online to go into the Tony Danza show.  She was getting ready to go in, and we put Anthony on the phone as Tony Danza, and it got very interesting. 
[00:32:00]  A lot of people saying this one was better than the first one.  Well, I don't think she wanted to accept that her beloved Tony Danza would speak to her in such a way.  I love this.  Why don't we check this out?  Well, Anthony, we got Sex Bagel on the line.  We don't want to say where he is because it could ruin what we're about to do.  What's his name?  It's not up there.  Sex Bagel.  He works for us.  Who?  Eric.  He works on the show.  Oh, Eric?  Yeah.  You know Eric?  I didn't know.  It's not up on the board. 
[00:32:30]  Eric?  Yeah, I'm here.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I have a lady right here.  Not only is she a huge Tony Danza fan, she was telling me that she used to be on the Family  Feud back in when?  1993.  1993.  Did you score big?  We did Fox shows and we won over $18,000.  They won over $18,000 on the Family Feud.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Did you tell her that we were thinking about putting her on the Tony Danza show today?  Yes, I did.  And they're all excited.  Her and her family is right here.  They're just waiting to speak to Tony. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  And where is she from?  Aren't they where are you from?  We are from New Jersey.  Of course.  They're from Surgeonsville, New Jersey.  All right.  And what's her name?  Her name is Joan.  I'm going to give her the phone right now.  Just get Tony ready.  Hey, let me get into my Tony character.  All right.  Let's get Joan on the phone here.  Okay.  Here's Joan.  Yeah, he's right on the phone.  Hello, Tony.  Hey, Joan.  How you doing?  I'm doing fine.  We can't wait to come inside and see you in person. 
[00:33:30]  Well, I can't wait to have you on the show.  Thank you.  I mean, we watch it every day.  We love it.  I especially like the food, particularly.  Oh, you like the cooking segments.  I do.  I like the food segments.  Well, you know, I love to cook.  Being Italian, you know, I cook a lot at home.  Uh-huh.  And my kids, they get involved.  And I think it's something a lot of people like, you know?  Oh, you know what?  I have a great recipe for spaghetti and clams, the white sauce. 
[00:34:00]  Spaghetti and clams.  That's my favorite.  Well, you know, I'll send you the recipe.  You got a fantastic recipe for that.  Yeah, I'll send it to you.  You know something?  Hey, one day, I would love to have you maybe come on the show as, you know, a listener cooking  segment or a viewer cooking segment.  Oops.  Oh, I'd love to.  I'd love to.  And we could have you cook your special.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Actually, you know, if you ever come over to New Jersey, you can come out to Surgeonsville. 
[00:34:30]  We live way out in the country.  And it's a beautiful area, close to the Delaware River.  Oh, you have a nice place out there?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, we're cooking spaghetti and clams first.  You might as well taste it before it's aired.  Yeah, I should taste it first.  I like taking a little taste before I dip in, you know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how long have you been a fan?  You remember me from taxi?  I'm sorry, Tandy. 
[00:35:00]  I couldn't understand that.  Hey, you remember me from my old days in taxi?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We've been following your career.  You know, I know that you do shows in Atlantic City.  We're about two hours away from Atlantic City.  Oh, two hours.  So, you go there a lot?  Say that again?  So, you go to Atlantic City a lot?  Oh, yes, yes.  Oh, I love going there.  The gambling, the wars, yeah.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's wonderful. 
[00:35:30]  You all get on the big loser bus and take that down there?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Fantastic.  It's great.  Are you going to be in Atlantic City soon?  Well, yeah.  You know, I got my album, so I like to sing.  And I go down there to Tropicana.  And I get up there and, you know, I whine and the roofs give me money.  It's fantastic.  Oh, wonderful.  Wonderful.  Well, I have a cousin who happens to own a condo right on the boardwalk at the end of  the casinos. 
[00:36:00]  And it is just fabulous to go and visit him.  That sounds fantastic.  Yes.  You know something?  What?  You sound like a big Tony Danza fan.  I am the biggest Tony Danza fan.  So, I want to do something a little special for you.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Here it comes, kids.  Hold on to your hats.  Okay.  I need a little relaxation before the show.  You know, it's a stressful situation being out there.  I'm kind of new to the talk show thing. 
[00:36:30]  You understand?  Yes.  So, I'm thinking I could use a little company in the dressing room.  Oh, my goodness.  How would you like to come backstage and hang out with me while I get ready for the show?  I would love it.  I would love it.  Do I bring my family?  Me.  Excuse me?  Just me or do I bring the three people I came with?  Well, who do you have with you?  My husband is here and my two friends, Karen and Phyllis. 
[00:37:00]  Your husband's there?  Yes.  Well, that's fantastic.  Yes.  Can you see where this is going?  I can.  Now, I'd like you.  You know something?  Bring the whole family with you.  Oh, okay.  Backstage to hang out with me before the show because I need to relax a little bit.  Okay.  Great.  That's great.  Well, you are just so special to say that.  Thank you so very much.  I love being special.  And you know what relaxes me? 
[00:37:30]  What's that?  I love to relax with you.  Strap in, kids.  You know what relaxes me backstage?  Excuse me?  You know what relaxes me backstage in my dressing room?  Sure.  A nice fucking blowjob.  Oh, my.  I'm sorry.  I missed that on the phone.  No, you didn't.  Should I?  Tony likes having his hogs sucked before I gotta placate to the rubes out there. 
[00:38:00]  I would never use a word like placate.  What am I, insane?  Before I entertain all the rubes out there in my audience.  Oh, okay.  I like blowing a load on someone's face.  And you seem like that person.  Okay.  Should I give this phone to Eric so he knows what's going on?  You better give it to him so he can run as fast as he can away from your husband when  you tell him the news that you'll be backstage sucking Tony Danz's cock. 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  Fantastic.  I heard what you said.  I'm going backstage, Eric.  Okay.  Okay, here.  I'm going to give you to Eric so you can tell him what's going on.  Fantastic.  Okay.  See you soon, Tony, and thank you so much.  You certainly will.  All right.  I will come back right out.  Hey, run, Eric.  Run.  All right.  You got it?  Yeah, you can come home. 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  Okay.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe is she telling her husband right now?  Is that what?  I'm sorry?  Is she telling her husband right now?  Oh, my God.  They're jumping up and down.  I think she was so starstruck she had no clue what I was saying.  All right.  Ask her if she understands what's going on.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me move back.  They're moving the line in.  Hold on.  Oh, jeez.  I just wanted to ask you, do you guys understand what's going on and everything, right, about  what he said about the backstage and all that? 
[00:39:30]  Just be there.  Just be there?  Yeah.  Yeah, she understands.  Okay.  Does she understand what she has to do to Tony, though?  You understand what you have to do for Tony, right?  She doesn't.  I was having trouble hearing you.  She was having trouble hearing.  She just said to tell her if, again, what?  Do you want me to tell you?  Yes.  All right.  What does Tony want her to do?  I think that Tony should tell her.  Maybe Tony should tell her.  Yeah.  Tony should tell her.  Tony wants to tell her?  Okay.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Tony loves you.  He can't get enough of you. 
[00:40:00]  Okay.  I'm going to try to hear out here.  All right, Joan.  You listening?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm listening.  Look, I need you to come backstage before the show and give Tony Danza, myself, some oral  favors.  Some oral favors?  Is that what you said?  What did you say?  You heard me right, honey.  Party favors?  No, not party favors.  I need oral treats before the show to get me loosened up, and I pick abroad online every 
[00:40:30]  day.  Eric finds a broad that could give me oral favors.  Eric is telling me I have to blow up those party favor things.  No, he's saying a blow job.  Yeah.  I know what you're saying.  I understand what you're saying.  Do you get it now?  I get it now.  Joan Jones, suck on my bone. 
[00:41:00]  And you're not going to do this on television saying that?  No, no, no.  The Tony Danza on TV's got to be all nice.  The one backstage makes you choke.  She can't hear me right now.  She can't hear me right now.  Get her to run up on stage during the show.  All righty.  All right.  There's two Tony Danzas.  Also, I'm going to introduce you during the show.  Okay.  That's good.  So, actually, I can't say your name. 
[00:41:30]  That's all right.  But right after I say, extravadanza, I want you to run up on stage and join me.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  Absolutely.  I need a big hug from you.  Okay.  Right after I say, extravadanza, in the audience, everyone yells it out for the big prize money.  Yes.  And I'm going to present you with $10,000 for helping me out.  Oh, you're kidding.  So, all you've got to do right after, extravadanza.  I run up just as though, I mean, no one introduces me, so I just look like. 
[00:42:00]  No, you're going to look like a crazed fan, but I'm going to put my arms around you.  I'm going to introduce you to the crowd.  Okay.  And, you know, it's for, you know, Disney, Visa, and extravadanza.  Okay.  I can do that.  And don't, you know, you can tell your family and stuff, but we want to keep it secret from the audience.  Okay.  Okay.  That's it.  All right, Joan.  I will not be shy.  And I'll see you right after the show. 
[00:42:30]  Okay.  Thank you, Tony.  Take care.  Thank you, Joan.  It's my pleasure.  No, my pleasure.  Okay.  I'm going to give it to Eric.  Give the phone to Eric.  Okay.  All right, Eric.  Here's the deal.  You've got to, like, convince her.  So, tell her, you know what you have to do when Tony says extravaganza.  Extravadanza, Opie.  Extravadanza.  Extravadanza.  She has to run from the crowd and run on stage and hug Tony.  And if she does that, she gets $10,000, but she can't tell anyone it's happening. 
[00:43:00]  She's got to wait five seconds for the graphics to show.  She's got to wait five seconds.  Well, no, by the time she gets up there.  Oh, they'll go right back.  Okay, okay.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, it'll be crazy.  Okay.  Eric, try to sell that, all right?  And then get out of there.  All right.  Be as serious as possible.  And no one is supposed to know.  Tell her.  Okay.  It's a new bit there.  But don't make it, like, too much of a secret where she's going to be on to it.  Just reinforce what I said.  All right.  All right.  And Tony approved this, right?  Of course Tony did.  Yeah.  Of course.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  They're just reiterating to me.  You know what to do during the extravidanza when the graphic comes up. 
[00:43:30]  Because he loves giving it out of the way other people's money.  You know that, right?  So when he does extravidanza, the graphics go up, and she's up there doing the Plinko thing.  You know what to do, all right?  You go up there and give them.  And Tony's cool with it.  And she's all excited.  All right.  Great.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  You go inside.  You warm up, and you have a good time at the show, and we're going to get you backstage,  all right?  Okay.  We're good.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  We'll see you in a little while.  Bye.  Holy ass.  Oh, if I'm watching that later, and this broad does this, I'm going to crap myself. 
[00:44:00]  That's just too easy.  I will crap myself.  They just are so thrilled to death that they are talking with Tony Danza that he can say  anything to these people.  Anything.  All right.  Oh, that was so funny.  Oh, please, God.  Let that work.  Greg from Bloomfield.  Oh, man.  You jerk-offs are going to force me to watch that fucking Tony Danza show now.  Well, I hope it works.  It's an experimental.  We'll see. 
[00:44:30]  It will eventually.  Eventually, it will work.  Absolutely.  If we have to send the intern out with a Tony Danza shirt, we have to have a Tony Danza  shirt made.  Who doesn't want one?  Well, you know, I'd like one, too.  One with him in a Spider-Man suit with that luscious hog.  That was funny.  All right.  Well.  It's wrapping.  That was great, dude.  Here it comes.  That was really good.  Another successful Tony Danza phone call.  Can't lose.  They love Tony.  Oh, and they do love Tony.  That was from yesterday. 
[00:45:00]  And we have an update.  Unfortunately, the lady, the fat Midwestern rube, didn't run onto the stage.  A lot of people want to know if she went through with it.  No, we watched the show, and then we saw her sitting.  Eric identified her on the TV screen.  That's the best part of that thing, is Eric comes in and goes, that's the lady that you  messed with today.  And you see her in the audience.  And she was right above Tony's shoulder for the entire beginning of the show.  You could tell she was kind of thinking about it, but then she wasn't sure. 
[00:45:30]  She's sitting there with the biggest, dopiest smile.  This big, dopey mom pink sweater on.  The big turtleneck on it.  Her hair freshly done at the parlor.  She just looked awful.  Those old ladies that have their hair done at the parlor.  My grandmother used to do that.  She'd come around, and she had a great kazoo helmet from the Flintstones, and that was her  hair.  It was like a big, white, great kazoo helmet, and she would spray it with the hairspray, 
[00:46:00]  and that was it.  That was her.  Her hair was done.  It looked like cotton candy.  Big cotton candy head.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  And some of the women, they give it a little blue tint.  And it just looks like cotton candy.  And some women, you could see right through it.  It's all so thin, but they puff it up so high, you could look right through it.  Yeah.  And then she would go, she'd come over and go, what do you think of my hair?  I'm like, what?  Well, I just got back from the parlor.  And it looked exactly the same as it did last time we saw it. 
[00:46:30]  So I don't know what they were doing over there, but old people love doing, old ladies  love doing that.  They pile that hair up in a big mound and just lacquer it, and it's a helmet.  Just put the football guard in front of it.  They ought to do that.  Just attach a football guard onto it.  That's classic.  Face guard.  Well, so we were not successful as far as bringing that little bit to the next level.  No, it'll happen one of these days.  I'm sure of it.  Oh, yeah, it will. 
[00:47:00]  I'm sure some sucker's going to get up and run right for Tony, and Tony will probably,  his boxing instincts will kick in and he'll punch her right in the face.  That could be very interesting.  He'll be a sweeper on the show.  All right, you want to take a little break here?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we should break and regroup, and we got to talk about Liza Minnelli.  Liza Minnelli.  Who knew?  I didn't sleep last night at all.  I was just rolling around.  Me neither up.  Were you rolling?  Just rolling.  Or kicking.  Just rolling.  Over and over and over and over again. 
[00:47:30]  Tying yourself up in the sheets, were you?  Just too much on my mind.  All right, so we got to talk about Liza Minnelli next.  And we also have to talk about Arafat, I guess.  He's finally dead.  Is he?  Is he?  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  Well, for the past few days, there's been reports that he was dead, he wasn't dead.  And the French president, got to love the New York Post, went over to his bedside, which  is lovely.  Arafat dead, and he won't be missed.  Full story, pages two and three. 
[00:48:00]  That's some nice journalism there, isn't it, from the Post?  Yes, impartial.  Impartial reporting of the news.  Good, he's dead.  They ought to feed him to the rats.  Stupid Chirac probably getting a photo op.  Oh, I know.  What a piece of crap that guy is.  Well, I don't understand why any self-respecting Jew would have any relationship at all with  France, or anything.  Like, they go to France on vacation or something.  It's an anti-Semitic state. 
[00:48:30]  They hate Jews in France.  They really hate the Jews.  And this is, like, kind of proof of it.  Guy goes to his bedside.  The guy's a terrorist.  I don't care.  How come when they get old, they're all cute now, and nice, and everyone wants to remember  what he did that was good?  Which, I have no idea what that is, as far as Arafat goes.  But, once they get old, you forget about all the stuff he did.  There's a picture of him in here where he's just a bad mother effer.  He's, like, 40 years old.  He's got a machine gun at his side. 
[00:49:00]  He's got that kill everyone look on his face.  He's still the same guy.  Just older?  Just a little older.  Well, now he's dead, but...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that part.  He's the same guy, just dead.  Just dead now.  But he's the same.  Like, look, they show a picture of another terrorist.  One of, uh...  He looks just like the new terrorist they're showing.  Wouldn't be surprised if one of his own people poisoned him, just to get rid of him.  He was so irrelevant, he just kind of sat there in Ramallah doing nothing for two years.  Yeah, you need new blood in that PLO. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Get them all agitated again.  You need this every ten years.  Cleans out the bad blood.  I'd like to go to the phones, but, um...  Are they still broken?  Today's Thursday, like we called it yesterday.  Yeah, they're still busted.  So, they have to run in, you know, what people want to talk about.  With all this computer equipment, people have to run in with handwritten Post-its.  I have no...  All right.  Who's on what line?  Well, this makes for gray radio.  You just go to the phones and hope for the best.  Hey, who's this?  Hey, this is Eric from New Jersey.  All right, Eric.  What do you got? 
[00:50:00]  Hey, that girl that you had on there from the Tony Danza show yesterday.  She's right from my area, man.  Oh, really?  You have to remind me of all the cows and the freaking inbreds that we have over here in  Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  Thanks.  That's pretty rural, isn't it?  Oh, it's...  Yeah.  It's fucking cow tipping out here.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  No problem, man.  Have a great one.  Okay.  People think of Jersey, you think of the smelly refineries.  You don't remember.  There's parts of that are very much like Pennsylvania. 
[00:50:30]  These rubes walking around.  Hey, who's this?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  See, we got to get the phones fixed.  Testing.  You can't do a radio show this way.  Testing, one, two, three.  Who's on the phone?  Who's this?  Hello?  What's your name, fella?  My name's Tim.  Hi, Tim.  Welcome to the radio program.  Hey, how are you?  I've got a midget sighting for you.  Oh, see?  We didn't even know we were going to a midget sighting.  We interrupt this program for the ozone midget sighting.  Go.  Okay.  See, I'm a top of the city. 
[00:51:00]  Thrilled.  I don't want a midget sighting today.  I just decided.  I don't know, Ope.  Sometimes they're fun.  All right.  We're going to take a break because we have to figure out a system to get around this phone  problem.  Yeah.  It's really tough to do a talk show when you don't know what these guys want to talk about.  You know, I mean, we could just go to them all day.  That's fine.  But it would get very boring very quickly.  It's nice to know what they want to chat about.  Yeah, because then we could kind of control the flow of the show.  You know what I mean?  Then we decide when we want the midget sighting.  And we decide what subject matter we want to cover at any given moment. 
[00:51:30]  There you go.  Right.  All right.  Why don't we step aside and we'll continue with the Opey and Anthony show.  It's time to find America.  Let's hear it for California.  This guy's a champ, man. 
[00:52:00]  Lucky girl.  I need a towel.  Yeah.  I need a towel.  Come on.  They're applauding for the other booth, too.  Thumbs up.  Stop.  Jesus Christ.  Think you can do better? 
[00:52:30]  Call Opey and Anthony live at 866-WOW-1-WOW and give it your best shot.  How big does that thing get?  What up?  Fly niggas in the house.  What's up, fly nigga?  What's up?  That's a fly shirt, too.  It's a fly shirt.  They make them for men.  Now I'm just playing.  Where you get them from, Bob Hope?  Bob threw it out and you hope to fit? 
[00:53:00]  You ain't bad, nigga.  I'll push your shit.  You know, my shit is straight out the projects.  What's up?  How many niggas in from the projects, anyway?  Yeah, I knew y'all niggas was from the projects.  I smelled y'all steak motherfuckers when you came in.  Yeah, you motherfucker, you wearing that new Project Cologne called Back Staircase.  And your girl wearing a perfume called Pissy Elevator.  And y'all wise up with the bubble bath called Cheese Doodle.  Lighter on the cheese and heavier on the doodle. 
[00:53:30]  Now I'm serious, man.  Living in the projects is rough.  And one thing about the projects you know is if a Puerto Rican family live on your floor.  Right, mommy?  You can smell them, nigga, soon as you get out the elevator.  What you smell?  Garlic?  Pepporica?  Adobo? 
[00:54:00]  Serious, man.  Then they be blasting that nasty-ass music that go with the smell.  Yeah, you laughing because you know which music I'm talking about.  Mommy, then you don't get on the doodle.  No, no, no, no.  No, mommy, then you don't get on the doodle.  No, mommy, then you don't get on the doodle.  I'm serious.  Is she back there?  She'll kick my ass if she's here.  Oh, good.  It's sold out.  She can't get in.  You know how I would know if she was here? 
[00:54:30]  My wife has this noise that women can do that men can't do.  If she's disappointed.  I can't even do it as good as you.  She does it so loud, dogs show up in the neighborhood.  And then she follows it up with that F word that all women use.  And then you go, oh, yeah, this one.  Fine.  Guys, you hear fine.  You're fucked.  Sound it out right now. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, man.  Women just communicate different than we do.  They don't hear the same things that we say.  I was in a restaurant the other day.  I said, I'll have a milkshake.  What do you mean I'm fat?  I ordered a milkshake.  You didn't order me one.  That means you think I'm fat. 
[00:55:30]  And I'm negotiating for this Christmas present.  It was an antique.  You know, you can negotiate with antique people.  You know what I mean?  So the guy says, it's $100.  I said, well, I only have $80 on me.  She chimes in, I have $20.  Well, who are you?  And she says to me, why are you kicking me? 
[00:56:00]  Oh, man.  She means well, though.  I had a sprained ankle.  She always tries to take care of me.  And she goes, you should go to the chiropractor.  So I went.  I told the guys that I have a bad sprained ankle.  And the guy goes,  I said, excuse me.  I flunked biology. 
[00:56:30]  But that is not my ankle.  Oh, man.  I'm still diving for ham scraps, you six-piece chicken McNobody.  An open letter to O.B. and Anthony.  Anthony, if your penis wasn't so small, I'd let you shove it in between my big teeth.  It's a freak show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  What?  What does that mean? 
[00:57:00]  I didn't think we were still playing the small penis one.  We're going to have to have a meeting.  On top of a meeting.  On top of a meeting.  Hey, I don't care.  It's just too, like, the small penis DJ gag has been done.  You know?  Kind of stupid.  All right.  Well, this is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  And I officially don't care today.  I'm just going to tell you right now.  Officially?  Is it official now?  It's official. 
[00:57:30]  My God.  I put my heart and soul into the show every day.  But I'm going to tell you right now, I don't care today.  Not today.  I just don't care.  I don't have the energy.  I got to tell you guys, man.  It is really, really hard to do a talk radio show when everything is working perfectly.  Right.  It's a juggling act.  It really is.  But then when you don't have phones that work properly and other things, it just makes this  a real pain in the ass.  Now we're complaining.  Officially, I just don't care.  No, I'm not even complaining. 
[00:58:00]  I'm telling you that I don't care.  Because it's not going to get to me today.  So they figured out a system.  We got AOL instant messaging up and running.  So they're going to, like, instant message what the people over here want to talk about.  Are you kidding me?  Because we have phones ringing.  All the phones are ringing.  I mean, the show is getting quite popular across America.  I don't know why.  Because if I was listening to this cluster after every day, I don't know if I'd be into  it.  The people seem to enjoy it. 
[00:58:30]  So we got a ton of phones ringing.  We don't know what they're talking about over here.  So now Ben, who gets a nice golf clap today, he figured this system out.  He goes, all right, look, I'll sign on on my AOL instant messaging.  So then what they have to do is instant message, Ben, over here, you'll hear the AOL popping  up.  And they're telling us now what the people on the phones want to hear.  Want to talk about.  Excuse me.  Or want to hear.  Every time we want to know who's on a phone line, you'll hear, brring.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Give me a second here.  All right.  Here comes the next one.  Here comes the next one.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  There you go.  Another caller.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  This is what we're reduced to.  This is today's.  An AOL chat room.  This is today's problem.  I just.  At this point, I just laugh every day.  Because every day, I'm still taking calls from Washington, and we're trying to solve problems  that never get solved, and then there's another reason why it can't be solved, or someone 
[00:59:30]  else to blame.  It's just.  I don't care anymore.  It's just hilarious.  See, I don't speak with Washington.  Dude.  I turn my phone off.  Honestly, you have to start talking to Washington.  I turn my phone off.  I don't care anymore.  But then you tell me that they get angry when we bitch about things up here.  Yeah.  But how could they get angry?  Because it's really happening.  I know.  I mean, the phone really isn't working for two days.  And we really are using AOL Instant Messenger to screen the phones. 
[01:00:00]  Like, you know, these corporate people down in Washington, just try to do your job without  a cell phone.  All right?  There you go.  That's pretty accurate.  I found out why the office isn't done.  They had a problem with the construction crew, I guess.  What?  But no one told us.  So we bitch on the air, and then they get mad we're bitching.  But no one, you know, lets us in on the fact that there was some problems with the  construction team, I guess.  What team?  There was one guy showing up every day with a ladder and a hammer on his hip. 
[01:00:30]  Pass that.  Okay, it's me.  All right, I'll hold it.  I'm part of the team today.  It hit me today.  I just don't care.  I really, you know, you can just take so many phone calls, and it's just hilarious at  this point.  All right, so now we got instant messaging telling us what the people want to talk about  over here, I guess.  All right.  And all right, well.  See if that works.  All right, let's wait.  Now I got to move the mouse over here.  Now you got to look and count down what? 
[01:01:00]  One, two, three, four, five.  All right.  You guys, we got Chris in Vegas.  Guess what's in my pants?  We got Max in Dallas.  Squirting midget story for Norton.  Squirting midget indeed.  We have Josh in Maine.  He wants to start a contest called the raunchiest state in America.  Mike in Baltimore wants to ask Norton if he ever got a private view.  Don't know what that is.  I don't know.  We might have to go to that one, I guess.  And then line three, which is at the bottom, which makes it confusing, Brian the trucker 
[01:01:30]  has an easy pass story.  We could get rid of Brian, I guess.  Well, I'd love to hear what happened.  Did you go through and the bell didn't ring?  All right, let's fall off the windshield.  Of course you could say he wants it.  Here's a good easy pass story, and this is the only type you should call in with.  I'm going through easy pass.  All of a sudden, this chick comes out and blows me in the toll lane.  Then she leaves and gets hit by a truck.  That's an easy pass story you should call the radio show with.  Might have been his story.  All right.  Who knows? 
[01:02:00]  Here's the problem with your system, Ben.  When we hang up on a caller like Brian, now what happens?  Oh, now you can't get rid of it.  It's on instant messenger, so it's going to stay there for all time.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  This is a nightmare.  It closes and reopens.  And, you know, a lot of people expect me to get pissed off and break things.  But you know what?  You got an ope that just doesn't care today.  That's right.  I don't care.  Now put line three empty.  Yeah, right?  That's right.  Yeah, you got to work on your system now, Ben. 
[01:02:30]  There it is.  There it is.  Okay, line three is empty now, so don't go to line three.  All right, Mike in Baltimore.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  As fucked up as it sounds on that end, it sounds great on this end.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mike.  Love the show.  Jimmy, you're a fucking riot, man.  I swear to God, there's been days where I've been listening to you guys, and you've wanted  to make me piss my pants.  Oh, that's the goal.  That's sexy.  But, hey, Jimmy, I've got a question for you.  Have you ever had a private view?  I might know it by another name. 
[01:03:00]  It's basically like you go to this seedy apartment, and you have a chick that comes  to the door in lingerie, and she gives you basically a naked lap dance, and then you  can negotiate for extras.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's almost like going for a massage.  I've never actually done it with strippers because I have such a hatred for those cornball  strippers that show up, and I've had them come over.  They're supposed to be hookers.  They charge $100 just to show up.  They'll do some lame, awful dance, and then they want you to start paying, baby. 
[01:03:30]  They want like $300 or $400.  It seems like the stripper comes to your house and does what she does in a strip club at your  house.  It's the worst.  Unless he's talking about something different.  Are they advertised as dancers?  Well, there's a website.  Let me give you the website.  It's called The Erotic Review.  Oh, eroticreview.com.  I've been on it so many times.  I almost said it like a Mad Dog Russo, though.  The Erotic Review.  The Erotic Review there, Mikey.  I go there all the time, pick up prostitutes.  Yeah, they have pictures, and you have to be a member to read the seedy details of every  encounter. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, but it's only like $25 a year, so it's worth it.  Or if you start posting your own reviews, you get a free membership, so you'd probably  be a shoo-in for that.  That site stinks, though.  I've tried to join it.  I tried to pay to become a VIP member so I could read all the filthy details, and it  keeps saying my account is activated, but something's not right.  It's very, very frustrating.  Well, I'll tell you what.  I don't know how often you get down to the Northern Virginia area, but there's a couple  of places in Northern Virginia that do the private views, and the chicks are bald-ass 
[01:04:30]  private views.  I only get down to Northern Virginia.  Occasionally, I'll go down and do the Don and Mike show.  We have the extravaganza that we do.  We're on Halloween.  I'll come in his freedom.  I'll call him Boo Boo, and he'll laugh, and Mike will pretend to hang himself.  Oh, no, that bitch again.  We all laugh about it.  It doesn't really mean nothing.  And now for the news.  He's going to twist it.  I can't believe you make a distinction between strippers that would come to your house to 
[01:05:00]  do things for money, and other girls, whether they're escorts or hookers, that you also bring  to the house.  And there's a difference there that I had no clue about.  I thought if you paid money to a girl that was coming to your house, it was all the  same.  But Jimmy, stripper bad, these other girls good.  Only because of the honesty.  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  Just one second.  I'm saying because of the honesty in the advertising.  Where a girl says, you know, $150, $200, full service.  She's coming over.  That's what she's doing.  Everyone knows what's going to happen.  Absolutely.  But with the dancers, now you have to negotiate. 
[01:05:30]  It's a nightmare.  And play this stupid game with her, right?  I had them in L.A.  It was kind of like with this guy.  She's just working her way through college.  Oh, you know, I really don't do this long.  You know, I can tell you're scraping the teeth, you idiot.  I really don't do this long.  Long.  I was going to say, I haven't been doing this for long.  Yeah.  You know, the phones aren't working.  All right.  The chicks there are real young, too.  I was the first chick that I ever got there.  We were talking.  We were saying, you know, I come down to this area and you want to meet me at this  club sometimes.  She goes, well, I'm not old enough to get into clubs.  I'm only 19. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, that's what you want to hear.  I'm only 19.  Yes, I will be in five years.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Hey, Jim, I've got one more question for you.  Mike, please.  I'm too good.  You can't set it up like that.  I even see that one coming.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Wow.  I have one more question for you.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  All right.  Wait.  Now, who's on three?  Because it says on the instant messaging, Brian, the trucker, easy pass story.  Then it says three empty.  But now there's now three is ringing and it's on whole, which means he hasn't screened 
[01:06:30]  it yet.  Oh, he hasn't screened it yet.  All right.  This won't be too confusing today.  No, we'll get it done.  And what about line seven?  You'll get used to this system.  We'll get her done.  And what about Larry says?  What about line four?  And now line two is different.  And now one has hung up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  You are really in a busy way.  Why did one?  Hey, can you put it up on the screen properly, Probe?  I've been practicing the put.  And the listeners are getting sick of that bit.  Practicing.  I have.  I walked around my neighborhood going put, put, put, put, put, put. 
[01:07:00]  Looking like a lunatic.  Looking like?  All right.  Well, I don't know.  Now five's gone.  I want to go to him.  And what does four want?  Oh, my God.  No.  Everyone was asking for you guys at the party.  Seven.  Seven.  Oh, you know, getting up early. 
[01:07:30]  And they're like, yeah, that must be terrible.  I'm like, yeah, you know.  Six.  No, we talked to six already.  So six is different.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  Holy ass.  I'm going to lose my mind.  How was the party?  You know, the party was good.  I do want to know.  Who was there?  The only celebrity there besides, you know, yours truly and Voss was Leary.  And it was great.  I mean, it was really a nice party.  Leary there.  Did he snub you?  No, no.  He come up.  He actually remembered my name.  He introduced me to his wife.  He was actually very nice. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  He's always been nice to me.  Oh, Leary's great.  A few times.  But it was great.  And I went to the Tough Crowd party earlier, the last get together for everybody, which was miserable.  Oh, MC Hammer was at the party last night.  So, of course, I annoyed him for a picture.  Oh, MC Hammer.  Or Hammer now.  Yeah, he's not MC.  Yes, he's not MC.  Yeah.  Isn't he like a preacher now?  I don't know what he is.  He's a preacher man.  I saw Chuck Nice, and he goes, that's Hammer.  So, I went over and got a picture with him.  Yeah?  Shamelessly.  One, two, three.  Yeah.  I'm too legit to quit, too.  Ugh. 
[01:08:30]  Idiot.  And then there was a Tough Crowd party, still milking that thing?  Well, no, it was the last, you know, the last, it was like the rap party for the season.  It was also the rap party for the entire series, and it was miserable.  Was it?  I mean, yeah, everybody was fine, but it was like, ugh.  All depressing because you're not coming back for anything?  Yeah, I'm still really pissed off about it, you know?  I mean, everything in my career I've touched has failed, and I accept that.  Oh, stop it.  I'm saying it happened.  It's the way it is in the business.  That show wasn't a failure, though.  It was on the air for two years. 
[01:09:00]  That's what I'm saying.  This was different because this was, it didn't have to come off.  I know why it came off.  Well, you know, Wanda Sykes' show had to go on.  Maybe you should make some room.  I think she's a 1030 show.  They're going to replace us with a cartoon or, you know, something silly.  It's not so much the cartoons, I think, that are bad on Comedy Central.  It's things like that Wanda show and that goddamn Reno 911.  It's just awful.  They love Reno.  I haven't seen Wanda's show yet.  They push that Reno 911 show like it's hysterical and everyone loves it. 
[01:09:30]  I'd love to know how many people are watching that.  Another phone call.  Ooh.  Ring.  Because it's just an awful show.  You guys are very funny.  I like tuning in and watching my pals rip each other apart.  It was just great.  Every show degenerated into us just shitting on each other.  Yeah.  It really stinks.  I enjoyed that.  Speaking on shitting on each other, look who just walked in.  Rich Voss is here.  Oh, good.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, my God.  What does that mean?  Can you see what?  Can you see that?  Yeah.  He typed HFHFDSHSHFSDF.  Wow.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  This is a mess.  Is Ozzy on the line, though?  Is that true?  Ozzy.  All right.  Let's talk to Ozzy on 11.  Ozzy!  Hi, guys.  How's everything going today?  Pretty good.  We want to know what's going on with you, actually.  Just in case you turned on your XM satellite radio last night to pick up the Opie and Anthony 
[01:10:30]  show, the brand-new version of the Opie and Anthony show, usually a lot better than today.  Ozzy called in recently and said that he's getting a divorce from Sharon Osbourne.  Yeah.  When I first spoke to you guys about it, it was kind of a tentative thing, you know.  But I called to let you guys know it's taken, you know, it's taken more of a final approach to it, you know. 
[01:11:00]  What do you mean?  Ozzy, I'm just saying it's looking to be final, you know.  Well, does Sharon know that you're going to divorce her?  Absolutely.  At this point, we went to a marriage mediator and all that garbage, you know.  And I'm just, I'm kind of upset about it, you know.  I bet you're going to get screwed, man.  I bet you're going to get so much of your stuff taken away. 
[01:11:30]  I'm preparing for it.  We're going to try and work something out, something, you know, fair for the both of us.  Because while she manages my money and she was managing me, I was still, you know, the talent  that brought in the money, you know.  So, we're going to try to be civil about it, you know.  But we're going to try and keep it, you know, out of the media as much as possible. 
[01:12:00]  I know I'm telling you guys now, but, I mean, I love you guys.  You want to keep things out of the media, this is the show to do it on, that's for sure.  Because we don't get any media attention, you idiot.  But, you know, hopefully, you know.  What do you think, you're just making a private phone call to our homes?  I mean, you want to keep it out of the media, call Frank's place.  No, I understand it.  So, you officially told her that you're getting a divorce, and did she take it well? 
[01:12:30]  She was upset, you know, obviously.  But there's been things brewing in the background, you know, that I told you about the cheating thing.  It wasn't just that, you know.  It's been a lot of other stuff, man.  Like what other stuff?  She hasn't been hitting you or anything.  No.  It's mostly been something about, you know, nagging, you know. 
[01:13:00]  At one time, I remember this clearly.  I was supposed to be doing an appearance on Long Island, you know.  And I think I was actually talking to you guys that day.  And I was on the phone doing the interview with you guys.  And she's like, you've got to hurry up, Ozzy.  You're going to be late doing this.  And I was like, I am hurrying up.  That's why I'm taking a fucking helicopter, you know. 
[01:13:30]  And so it was just things like that.  And I think you guys that day kind of became like the friends I wasn't allowed to see, you know.  She became, you know, demanding.  And it's just too much, man.  Especially at my age, I can't.  I got to enjoy the few years I got left, you know.  Yeah, well, so are you guys still living together?  I'm actually in the process of, you know, living in a temporary home today. 
[01:14:00]  You're moving out today?  I'm in the process, you know.  I got some of my possessions, you know.  But I don't have everything I'm going to take with me as of yet, you know.  And where are you going to move to?  Down the street or something?  Are you close by so you can see the kids?  What's up?  Yeah, I'm going to be close by in Los Angeles.  But, you know, I'm not going to be in fucking Beverly Hills. 
[01:14:30]  You honestly think I wanted to live in Beverly Hills all these years?  Yeah, that seemed a little weird when we saw that on TV.  Ozzy in Beverly Hills.  Absolutely not, man.  Yeah.  You're standing up for yourself finally, Ozzy, huh?  Yeah, it only took, you know, like 30 years.  You know she's going to come after you.  I know.  That's why I'm trying to keep it civil with her, you know.  Because, like I was telling you guys last time, I mean, I really don't have a leg to stand on. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, she kind of took care of your career, you know.  Yeah, man, I'm well aware.  That's why we're trying to, you know.  I thought there was something about if there was any infidelities that, you know, that it would be in my favor.  But I'm not too up on the legal matters, you know.  Yeah, well, are you getting action on the side yet, or what? 
[01:15:30]  Not as of yet, man.  I haven't really been trying, though.  So I'm sure if I, you know, if I want to, I could.  I'd imagine that you would want to get some young poontang.  Sure, man.  Sure.  It's second on the list, you know.  But right now, I'm just trying to sort it out with, you know, getting my own place going.  Yeah.  Man, once you get the place, that's when you get the girls. 
[01:16:00]  Sure, that's when I can start having fun again, you know.  You should go on a Craigslist and look for girls.  There's plenty of them.  Yeah, listen to your pal, little Jimmy Norton.  He could get you laid there, Ozzy.  I would love to get laid with Jimmy Norton.  Not like that.  Ozzy, calm down.  Sure, he would love it.  Yeah, I'd take it.  Yeah, of course Jimmy would take that one.  All right, Oz.  Well, I hope things work out for you with the move today.  I appreciate it, guys.  I just wanted to update you.  I told you I would, so. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  All right.  Have a nice show, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Ozzy.  All right.  No problem.  There he goes, Ozzy.  Goodbye.  Doesn't look like they're going to get back together.  Looks pretty grim over there in the Osborne household.  Pretty grim, yes.  All right.  Will Ozzy's biopic end with the words, Sharon, Sharon, my best friend?  Let's see. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, the phone's still?  Yeah.  Anyone want to comment on that, Opie?  I don't know yet.  Now we have to wait.  You can't tell?  You can't tell yet.  The lightning fast AOL instant messenger?  All right.  He's probably pecking in there one key at a time.  Yeah, one key at a time, eh?  No, I mean, Eric's doing a great job.  Ben came up with a pretty good system here, but, you know.  So that's what AOL's good for these days?  Just in case you're a radio show and your phones go dead?  Because that's the only reason I would even think of using it.  I like AOL. 
[01:17:30]  You still use AOL?  I do.  Doesn't everybody who's computer savvy?  Well, the broadband's not bad on AOL.  But you're paying for broadband.  The service, you have to pay your cable company for the rapid service.  They put together a lot of great video in the morning.  But you can pretty much get that anyway.  I know, but they make it easy.  You sign on, and then I can get the news really fast.  And, like, when the Red Sox were in the World Series, I couldn't stay up late for all the games.  They do, like, a five-minute recap. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, but you can get that on Sports Illustrated.  No, I understand, but you have to go to individual websites.  It's all right there packaged nicely.  They package things nicely.  It's like training wheels, though.  And they got the videos.  I saw the new YouTube video on AOL before.  I saw it on MTV or VH1 or any of those places.  But you're paying for it.  That's pretty much it, too.  You're paying for AOL.  Have you seen your paycheck lately?  Who cares if we pay for it?  Believe me, I spend a little more than you do.  All right.  I don't care.  It's what?  I don't even know how much it is anymore.  It's like $29 a month. 
[01:18:30]  $10 a month?  $29 a month.  Oh, is it?  All right, whatever.  But then on top of that, you're paying.  I'm just saying the way AOL makes it sound sometimes is like AOL broadband.  It's like, ooh, they have nothing to do.  It's the connection that you're getting through your cable company.  You're still paying for your cable modem and your broadband connection to your house.  AOL just happens to try to sneak in that they have this AOL broadband.  Yeah.  You have broadband.  It's in your house.  I just think it was training wheels. 
[01:19:00]  I used it originally.  When we used to go in the chat rooms looking to trade pictures, you go in those rooms and  then, bing, you've got mail.  Oh, let me see what he sent me.  Now I've got to send one back.  Yeah.  I'll send back the one I got like.  Yeah.  And then it scrolls slowly.  And I'm seeing forehead.  And the internet is for porn.  It's for porn.  All right.  Well, we finally have a comment coming in about Ozzy.  It only took about a minute and a half.  So let's say hi to Chuck in Indiana. 
[01:19:30]  Hey, Chuck.  What are you guys doing?  Hey.  We're trying to do a show here.  I know you are.  Y'all doing fine.  All right.  What do you have, bud?  If Ozzy's getting a divorce, then that means it's going to be a broken home.  So does that mean his daughter's on the market?  She seems like the type of girl that's been on the market.  Let me tell you something.  What's that?  She's chunky.  You've got to give her that.  But, man, those tits on her. 
[01:20:00]  Have you seen these lately?  She was on the music awards or something.  I'm not digging her anymore.  Dude.  I'm just talking about the tits.  She gained a little too much weight.  She was in that nice, comfortable, chunky stage.  And then, no.  Then she added another 10 pounds and, no.  No.  She can sing, though.  What?  She can't sing.  She can't sew.  No, she can't.  She's fantastic, dude.  I'm not.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I'm not buying that.  What?  Shut up.  You have to be joking.  You have a half a smile on your face.  I'm not buying it. 
[01:20:30]  Because the way you guys are looking at them, you know the song Shut Up was great.  The Changes song she did with Ozzy was great.  I'm not buying it.  She stinks.  She doesn't stink.  Her puppet don't preach.  I don't know.  Anthony would know the effects thing on her voice.  That's better than Madonna's.  It's better than Madonna's.  You're out of your mind.  They put some kind of chorus echo on there.  And that's used when you're really not hitting the notes right on the money.  And it kind of makes it sound better, like you're staying on key.  Yeah, but her puppet don't preach is very good.  And I also, I think that Shut Up! 
[01:21:00]  That song was really good.  You like that one, too?  I don't remember how it went, though.  Which one is this?  I can't read lips.  Papa don't preach.  Papa don't preach?  All right.  It's awful.  Eric talks in my headphones every so often.  It's interesting.  I like to hear that, but I'm waiting for them to replace the jack.  The wrong jack.  But we're not complaining.  No, no.  I'm not complaining about anything today.  Improvising, adapting, and overcoming.  This is so processed. 
[01:21:30]  It's not even her voice.  Sure it is.  She's good.  Technically, it's her voice.  And then they throw her through a bunch of machines, and this is what you get.  Damn.  There you go.  I'm not going to preach.  It's all distorted. 
[01:22:00]  Here we go.  Let's get to the hook here.  Oh, you hear that note?  Papa don't preach.  I'm in trouble. 
[01:22:30]  Shut up is better.  That was funny when he just did.  It's awful.  Shut up is better.  Quick, get the fire extinguisher.  Oh, Steve's hat.  Hey, that's the one we got him at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Exactly, that's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Where did you get that?  You went to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  He wasn't there?  He didn't go with us.  What an ass.  We're shut up.  Do we have that?  Do I hear a little shut up? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, I'm telling you, this is better.  The other one is a little bit processed, but that's not her fault.  It's bad production.  It's technically her voice.  They throw it through the machines, and then they make it sound good.  I have the worst singing voice.  Do you like this?  Fantastic.  This makes me yearn for Avril Lavigne. 
[01:23:30]  I know Jimmy's lying.  I can just tell.  He's got it, man.  Look at him.  It's totally good.  Look at him.  He's tapping his hand on the console.  Yeah, I like this one.  Turn it off.  There comes the hook.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  That's what it sounds like. 
[01:24:00]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  It's over, Johnny.  All right.  There you go.  That's my favorite clip from anywhere.  All right.  At first, he's trying to keep his cold.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  All right.  We talked to Chuck already. 
[01:24:30]  Five is Josh.  No matter what clip is playing, I'll laugh if Turn it Off is behind it.  Of course.  Is that the new Josh?  Or is that great?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You could not be serious.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, she just wants people to shut up, and that's probably her interpretation of the  way she hears them.  It's like all one noise.  You shut up.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I have the worst singing voice imaginable.  I guarantee I could with someone that's good with production.  Get Opie in a studio.  It could make me sound really good.  Why don't we try that? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, we have that old audio of Opie singing Godsmack at A&W.  Remember that?  No, I don't remember that.  Oh.  Oh, that's right.  Anthony remembers it.  You were tapping here.  I'm doing the best time ever.  You know, like that.  It was really funny, actually.  Do you have the audio, or is it missing a lot of the other audio?  Yes, we don't have that.  We don't have anything.  What?  What?  Oh, what is that?  Hello?  Hello?  Calling from a boat?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, Dan?  What's going on, guys?  See, I knew it was Dan, because I went over here.  Ah. 
[01:25:30]  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  Hey, I live down in Newark, and I'm on the whole way home from work the other day, and  there's, like, fucking wow signs on every corner.  In Newark?  Yeah, in Newark.  Those are our new ones.  They say fucking wow.  So I'm driving, and we figure it out.  And the hour was pointing, and we're like, I guess it's a sticker stock or something.  We're driving through, and it's that movie, War of the Worlds, with the...  Oh, yeah, they're remaking War of the Worlds.  Yeah, they're remaking it.  Yeah.  Well, no, no, it was never a movie. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, that's right.  It was an actual, like...  Oh, it was a movie, wasn't it?  War of the Worlds?  Probably.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  It was.  It was.  Okay.  They're doing it with...  Spielberg's doing it with Tom Cruise.  Yeah, Tom Cruise.  Okay.  Yeah, so there's signs for the cruise, and I guess everybody to come down there is a big  wow sign.  Oh, well, it has nothing to do with our program, but thanks.  No, well, we're going to put the O&A on it on XM Saturday Radio.  Oh, that would be cool.  Yeah.  We would like that.  We're into vandalism.  Yeah, definitely.  I figure it's Newark, so you'll get a lot of clients out of that.  Thank you, mister.  Thank you. 
[01:26:30]  All right, let's go to Peter in Long Island.  You're listening to an Opie that doesn't care today.  Peter?  Yes.  Hey.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  Who's this?  Peter.  Who are you calling?  I'm calling for Anthony.  I know he's busy right now.  I brought up the cleaners yesterday.  I wonder if he got it.  If he liked it.  I brought up the hand sanitizer yesterday.  Pete?  What?  Pete? 
[01:27:00]  You're a nut.  And I'm in.  You're a nut.  Yeah, Master Poe came in.  Where is all that stuff that Master Poe brought in?  You want to get Master Poe in here?  Master Poe comes in with...  Or is he trying to get rid of more bloody geese?  Sprays?  Jesus.  And lotions?  And hand sanitizers?  This must be the guy that brought all that stuff in, right?  Here it is.  Oh, here it is.  All right, here comes Master Poe into the studio, Anthony.  You're the best.  Oh, wow.  Nothing's going to happen. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, Master Poe.  Oh, wow.  Look at the yellow.  Yellow.  This song gets you pumped.  It does.  Oh, wow.  I feel like I could get in the crane position and kick some young blonde boy in the face.  And then just rub him and make him feel better.  Yeah.  Master Poe, so this guy Peter stopped by yesterday?  He's on the line, I think.  Yes, I am.  Oh, okay.  I didn't get the card.  What's the card?  It's for all your janitorial needs. 
[01:28:00]  You need Enterprises.  He's the vice president.  Smells good, actually.  And I thought it was some kook that was just sending up sprays and stuff.  He sent us up deodorizing spray for Jimmy's ass whenever Jim...  Well, we have the Lysol.  Is that one?  Yeah, we have...  But here's some Orchard Spice Spray if you need it.  Okay.  It's an odor neutralizer.  Great.  The hair stuff smells good, the Gojo.  What is this?  Okay.  Luxury foam hair and body wash. 
[01:28:30]  Smell it.  It smells really good.  It's like girly, but it's nice.  What do you do with that stuff?  Ooh.  Isn't that lovely?  What do you do with the Gojo?  Sir?  Oh, my God.  Peter.  And yes.  Peter.  What do you do with the Gojo?  I think he was on a cell phone that didn't work.  Oh.  Well, I guess you use this if you're working in...  Maybe you work in a garage and you get a little oil on you and regular products don't  take it off.  For your hair, is it?  Yeah, but Gojo has always been this product.  I used to use it when I was on the job site just for my hands. 
[01:29:00]  But it takes grease and oil off of you.  So I guess this guy's figuring we're changing engines in Chevy Novas here in the studio.  And just in case we need that.  But it does smell...  It does smell nice.  I sure like that.  I wouldn't mind lathering someone up with it.  Now, do you want to keep the stuff from Peter?  Because you yelled at Master Poe.  I didn't yell at Master Poe.  Don't.  I would never yell at Master Poe.  I want to make that absolutely clear, Master Poe.  I would never yell at you. 
[01:29:30]  I don't know.  Don't start.  I don't know about that.  What?  I think when Master Poe left the studio, you had some things to say to Master Poe.  I was...  That you said to the door after he left.  Don't even.  Fuck.  Don't even.  I don't...  What are you talking about?  I'm not even making eye contact with Master Poe.  You know me, Master Poe.  Anthony.  I would never, ever say anything that would disrespect you.  Hmm.  Never.  You sure he didn't say anything as he was bringing all that stuff out of the studio?  Absolutely not. 
[01:30:00]  Absolutely not.  You're an idiot.  He's trying to start something that isn't there.  He's trying to instigate, huh?  I said nothing.  I just like to see you sweat.  I am sweating.  Do you think I want Master Poe to take out retribution on me for something I never did?  Honestly, I've...  Peter back in line.  We don't need Peter again.  No, thank you for the sprays and bumps and whatnot.  Honestly, Anthony is so polite to Master Poe, it's not even funny.  Of course. 
[01:30:30]  He's a nice guy.  And he could kill with a look.  You pick your words perfectly when you're around Master Poe.  Master Poe came in.  He had the sprays and stuff.  He goes, a listener sent these for you.  It's for Jim's ass and stuff.  And I'm going, why are listeners sending stuff like this?  We don't know where it came from.  We have a can of Lysol for Jimmy's ass.  And we don't really need anything else.  And then he showed me some hand sanitizer.  You ever see this stuff?  You just put it in your hand.  You don't need water or anything.  You rub it around.  That's what I thought that might be.  Well, we do have some of that too.  Right, Master Poe?  He sent some of that. 
[01:31:00]  Yes, yes.  I think it's in here or something.  Oh, can I use a little for my hands?  To clear this up, Opie was telling me about the situation concerning the guard downstairs.  And I thought that was more important than soap.  Yeah, there you go.  So I gave you the information.  I told you that Eric has the card.  If you're interested, by all means, speak to him.  Okay.  So you're going to kick the guard's ass for us?  No, I will not do that.  However, I'll make sure that he doesn't yell anymore.  When do you get to kick ass?  When someone hits you first?  No, when someone comes in and physically goes towards me. 
[01:31:30]  That's what I mean.  Well, he's not hitting me.  No, he doesn't hit him.  He's not one of those hit me first guys.  Right.  He's saying get in the vicinity and attempt it and you're going to get your neck snapped.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  You can pretty much tell from a guy's look if he's going to be aggressive with you, right?  It's body language and also their eyes.  You want to see exactly what they're about.  Dude, we'll work together.  If he's looking you up and down, looking to scope out where he's going to hit you,  you can pick that up in a second.  We'll work together.  I'll cover up the security cameras.  You do a number on him and then I'll vouch for you and say that he attacked you first. 
[01:32:00]  That he fell down in a drunken stupor on the floor.  Well, we can do that.  He slipped on Ben's coffee in the elevator.  We can do that or Anthony can assist me in a self-defense demonstration.  No.  Never.  I'd like to see that.  It would never happen.  I would lay there and just let you do what you will.  Steve will do it.  Why do I have to do this?  That would be one of the things.  That was one of the best things ever on the old show.  Who did you take on?  Tito Ortiz.  And he wasn't really taking on.  Who did I get knocked out by? 
[01:32:30]  Remember Tito Ortiz?  Ultimate fighting champ.  Right.  And we thought it would be great if Steve took him on.  Just to see how long Steve could actually go with the guy.  Kind of like riding a bull.  Yeah.  Riding a bull.  You know, how long could you stay on a bull?  So we said, Steve, take on Tito Ortiz.  And how long did he last?  12 seconds.  Was it that long?  Well, the thing is this.  I remember you just going down.  Yeah, it was 12 seconds.  And he wasn't trying to hurt you.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's the thing.  If you fight back, this guy could snap your neck.  And you have to sort of make a judgment call.  Do you fight back, punch him in the face, and risk him tearing your eyes out of your head? 
[01:33:00]  And that's the thing.  If I go up against him, he knows more kung fu.  Steve, that was the day, though.  All kidding aside, I knew you were the real deal.  I mean, who in their right mind would take him on, even in a fake fight?  And Steve was trying.  Like, he was trying to stay up.  And it was, I don't know, it was like watching the mighty Kong fall off of the building.  Yeah, that was when I was 120 pounds heavier, too.  He jumped on my back.  Were you that much heavier?  Oh, yeah.  It was before his surgery, right? 
[01:33:30]  And he jumped on my back.  The second I went, I did one half-assed wrestling move, took his leg out.  In the time that it took me to take his leg out, he was on my back, had me in a sleeper hold,  and I could feel my consciousness leak.  Conscious?  Consciousness?  Consciousness.  Consciousness.  How much did he weigh?  He's a big boy.  He was huge.  He had to be like...  He's big, though, right?  Tito, he's not a small guy.  230, probably.  And he just has those techniques, those grappling techniques, where he can tie you up to where you're  just not going to move, and then put a little sleeper hold on you, and you're done. 
[01:34:00]  You guys see, there's a documentary, you might have seen it, called Choke.  It's about...  The Yankees this year?  No?  No.  Yeah, Hicks and Gracie was in there.  Yes, it's also the Petersons.  Choke and swim?  Yeah, about Hicks and Gracie.  Who is Gracie?  No, this is Hicks and his older brother.  Oh, yeah.  But they say he's actually a better fighter.  The whole Gracie family is crazy.  Yeah.  Are those sleeper holds for real?  Yes.  I thought that was just the blood off to your head.  I thought that was just like an old wrestling fake move.  Well, they do the fake sleeper holds in WWF.  They show one guy, a little Asian guy, who's probably about 140 pounds, beating this guy 
[01:34:30]  who was probably 250, because the guy picked him up by his arm.  The little Asian man was hanging on the arm of the other man like a kid, but he did something  with his legs, and he locked the guy's arm, and the guy just patted immediately, because  he was about to have his arm snap by 150 pounds.  They can tie you up with their body, and then they start putting a little pressure on a leg  or an arm where you've got to tap out.  You're done.  It's broken.  Right, or it's going to be broken.  I've watched those Ultimate Wrestling things where they do snap people's arms. 
[01:35:00]  What?  Oh, God.  What?  Jesus.  Jimmy pulled his pants down, and he's showing his ass to Voss out the window.  And what is Voss writing on that piece of paper?  Voss thought all of a sudden it was a mirror when he looked into it and saw an ass.  Oh, it's a piece of paper that says, I love you, Jim.  All right.  Oh, that was funny.  Voss needs attention.  He's really going to laugh.  He needs attention.  We'll get him in here in a few minutes.  All right, Master Paul.  He thought it was a mirror.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you. 
[01:35:30]  I want to see you give a demonstration, though, someday, because Voss took karate.  He actually did take karate.  Oh, that's right.  He brags about it sometimes.  Voss, come in here.  What style of karate?  I'm not sure.  He probably doesn't even know.  Listen, a karate.  It's pronounced karate.  All right, Voss, get over here.  Look at you.  Rich.  That's a solid ass.  Did you sleep in your car?  Look at that DVD.  I slept for two hours around the corner at my manager's house.  I cannot believe you went with Spinal Tap's idea for your DVD.  Is that Spinal Tap?  Just black. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's the black album.  First of all, let me explain this.  I actually like it.  This is Voss, not Spinal Tap.  Okay, this is a collector's element.  I'm just saying that Spinal Tap did the same thing, the black album.  Did they really?  Yeah, they were like, the Beatles had the white album.  We'll have the black album.  No, I went with the Chicago theme, like Voss 1, Voss 2.  Oh, is that it?  I mean, not that I could ever get to 2 TV.  Oh, right, the band?  Yeah, and plus it's easy to spell.  That is true.  It says Voss and white lettering, and it's on black.  Here's the thing.  You don't want to pay for printing, obviously. 
[01:36:30]  No, I could pay.  When you go to a record store, Dummies, when you put something out that's sellable, it's  called the 10-foot rule in a record store, and if you could see from over 10-foot  Are you giving marketing tips, the 10-foot rule?  Yeah, I'm giving marketing tips.  Is that how you decide who you're going to blow in a rest area?  Yes.  I look into this, and I'll ask myself, how much more black could it be?  And the answer's none.  None more black.  But you know what?  If you open it up and you see the second thank you, then you will see...  Who's the first?  Who's the first?  Yeah.  Who is the first thank you? 
[01:37:00]  Jim Norton, I think, is the first.  Aw.  Oh, all right.  No, I don't think...  I don't know.  Maybe that's under friends.  Open up the brand new Voss DVD to see who he thanks first.  It's black.  It's a cool cover.  It just says Voss and White, but I don't like the way the DVD symbol in white is on the top  left.  Yeah, we're taking that off.  Why is that?  You know what?  I didn't print them.  Here's the thing.  We're going to take it off on the next one.  Oh, special thanks to Caroline's Comedy Club is first.  Oh, okay.  Opie and Anthony.  There you go. 
[01:37:30]  Caroline just helps you more than Opie and Anthony.  No, no.  It's just a thing.  Well, you know...  Last Comic Standing is third.  All right.  And then it really drops off.  Really?  Why aren't Opie and Anthony under friends, though?  Where's...  Huh?  Why aren't Opie and Anthony under friends?  Oh, that's right.  We're under special thanks.  And friends, Jimmy Norton's first.  Oh, look at that.  To my awful friends.  And then Patrice, Keith, Florentine.  There you go.  Colin again.  Colin made both.  He's a professional and a friend.  You know what?  And we're just professionals.  No, yeah, but you know what? 
[01:38:00]  It would have looked too gay if I would have put you guys twice.  It looks gay no matter what you put, Rich.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  So, Rich, you know karate?  No.  Is that what I used to when I was like 20 years ago?  Why?  Well, because Master Poe knows a little karate.  Why?  Oh, did you bring me here to get my ass whipped again?  What's wrong with you guys?  I'm not your goddamn punching bag.  I'm not your signboy.  Yeah, I used to.  We just wanted a little demonstration.  That's all.  Steve doesn't want to demonstrate today. 
[01:38:30]  What style of karate?  Ugh.  Oh, Jesus.  First of all, you didn't talk that way when I walked in, okay?  You said, pleased to see you, and I'm glad I have a job.  Wow.  Master Poe, you hear that?  Master Poe.  I want to make sure you heard that.  Yeah, Mr. Poe, Master Security.  I wouldn't fuck with Master Poe.  That's a bad idea.  I wouldn't fuck with him.  I'm making the Poe remarks.  Dude, the other day he told a story that he had to get rid of a bloody gee in a dumpster  at five in the morning.  Yeah, really?  And he came up with a story that was about him. 
[01:39:00]  What did he do with the little girl?  Well, we don't know.  He told a story, and quite frankly, Norton and I, we're not sure if we want to believe  it or not.  We want to believe that it was.  Norton had to get rid of a bloody he a couple weeks ago.  I want to watch Poe be head-washed with his own awful DVD.  Throw it like a Chinese star.  It's like Odd Job with a hat.  It just goes right through his neck.  Man killed by a mediocre DVD.  That's funny.  I'm kidding.  No, the material's great.  Quit staring at me like that because you're making me very uncomfortable. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, he's a scary guy.  Look at him.  First of all.  Very scary guy.  His name is Master Poe.  What style?  Yeah?  I never heard of him yet.  No, what style have you taken?  I took Taekwondo, which is kind of like gay street karate, right?  Gay street karate?  Gay street karate.  That's a Korean style.  I kick them and then I lick them.  That's funny.  You've got to use that on stage, man.  I got tons of stuff. 
[01:40:00]  I'm always on fire.  All right.  Here's the thing.  Why don't you just do a little demonstration?  He's going to help kill me.  Why?  I don't want to see a lost demonstration.  Got that right.  Did you tell him what happened the last time I kicked?  How about the last time he did a kick?  Well, this is true.  I forgot.  I was dating this British girl and we're outside of a sushi place.  Really good place.  And Voss is like, I took karate.  So we're like, all right, let's see a kick.  So we're staying there and Rich goes to do a straight kick and he slips in garbage juice  and he falls right on his back on the middle of 11th Street, Greenwich Street. 
[01:40:30]  I got a quick kick.  I haven't done it in 20 years and I got a hernated disc and I can still kick.  But he'd kill me.  Let's see a kick at least.  At least see me kick?  Yeah, let's set up.  Over here.  Not by him.  Here.  Let's set up a Voss kick.  I don't want to see Voss get hurt.  And then Master Poe can maybe critique it a little bit.  I don't want to see Voss get hurt.  Nathaniel will do a karate demonstration.  Does Nathaniel do karate?  Do some moves.  Actually, Nathaniel studies the art of jiu-jitsu.  Does he?  Yes, he does.  How long have you been taking it?  About two years.  Okay.  Two years? 
[01:41:00]  Karate?  That's respectable.  Jiu-jitsu.  All right, who do you want to take on, Voss?  Just when someone talks about your hair, you know how to fight them now?  You're a mess.  Jesus, you've got the thinnest hair.  You're like 14.  Why don't you go like Norton to shave it all off and look presentable so they're just like  a walking wreck?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dude, your jeans are too tight to try and kick.  Oh, my God.  He's going to kick a nut right into his stomach.  His nut's going to pop out of his pants.  Please don't fall.  Do the camera.  Please don't. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So embarrassing.  I've never seen a midget.  Ow!  I've never seen a midget try and karate kick before.  Just out here.  Dude.  That's not bad.  Hold on.  Considering Voss is 58.  That's not bad if you're going to be kicking kindergartners in the head.  What are you doing?  First of all, I'm just saying.  I'm out of breath.  He's out of breath.  Your feet have the lift of a tank. 
[01:42:00]  Listen, if I stretch.  Oh, man, why am I out of breath after three kicks?  Because you just threw a kick in pants that are too tight for you.  There's no reason to be kicking in those pants.  Why are you wearing the tight pants, man?  I'm uncomfortable now.  I'm uncomfortable for you.  Someone give Voss a scrunchie and socks to pull up over them.  Master Poe, what did you think of his moves?  He wasn't placing his hip into the kick.  But, again, he hasn't practiced in how many years?  There you go.  Hold on.  How many years?  Later tonight. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  That wasn't bad.  Now he just hurt himself.  No, I didn't.  Oh, you look like you hurt yourself.  Okay.  Later tonight on OpenAnthony.com.  Stop with your nuts in those pants.  We have video of Voss kicking.  That wasn't bad.  That wasn't bad.  That wasn't bad.  That wasn't bad.  That would hurt.  Breathe.  Jesus.  Anybody have any primatee masks on him?  I'm sure glad you're taking care of that cigarette habit like you said you would.  Huh?  You really got to stop smoking.  I am going to quit.  Master Poe.  Hey, you know who?  I want to see Master Poe pick.  Is Heffron coming in? 
[01:43:00]  Is Heffron coming in?  I think so.  I thought he was coming in with you.  Oh, yeah.  He's a martial artist, too.  He's like an Israeli.  There he is right there.  He's like an Israeli.  All the comics.  All the comics love the kung fu.  Not me.  That's because we're scared of our audiences.  But, no.  Yes, I used to be really good in Taekwondo years ago.  But no Master crap, you know.  You know, we just fought.  Master Voss.  Yeah.  Master Voss.  I like that.  Oh, my.  The karate midget.  Are your legs in pain?  No, his whole body's in pain. 
[01:43:30]  Look at him.  He's turning red.  I'm a little out of shape.  I'm in good shape, like, on the outside.  I'll say you are.  On the outside, like, my...  Yeah, nothing was better than you and Carrot Top taking your shirts off on the...  Oh, yeah?  Did you drop a batch on your stomach watching that one?  You know, when I think Carrot Top, I'm not thinking beefcake display.  Yeah, look at those two guys who are working.  Is that what you did?  That was pretty much me.  Look at them.  Oh, they got a job.  Look at those employed hotties.  So what can we do with Voss and Master Paul? 
[01:44:00]  Is that good?  Not bad.  How old am I?  Hmm.  42?  47.  Okay.  47.  So you got a six-pack.  He looks good for 47.  How old am I?  How old are you?  Mm-hmm.  Old enough to get a real job and quit messing with me.  Oh.  35.  Oh, boy.  Very good.  How about a little demonstration?  No!  He's not going to take my head off.  Master Paul, how high can you kick?  He'll kill me.  Look at me.  You can tell.  Look how confident he is. 
[01:44:30]  Let me see how high he can kick.  All right, well, first of all, kicking will get you in trouble in the street, okay?  You're not supposed to kick high at all.  I'm just messing with you.  All right, that's number one.  No higher than the balls.  You got to kick the knee sideways.  You kick below the hips, kick to the shin, kick to the knee, kick to the groin.  That's fine.  After that, if you kick above that, you're in trouble.  But Daniel kicked in the face when Nishmiyagi told him the crane move.  He kicked in the face.  Yes. 
[01:45:00]  No, I know.  Because he got tired.  Yeah?  See what?  I forgot what I was going to say.  I was going to say something about he was tired of Pat Morita raping in it.  I'm like, can I please just switch gears once?  See, nobody knows you.  I just want to see a high kick from Master Paul.  Nobody knows this.  Norton, years ago, used to have a chin, and somebody front kicked him right here.  Oh, is that it?  One out of seven isn't bad.  One bad one out of about seven.  Here's why I didn't get left, because it was mean and hurtful.  Mean and hurtful?  And I'm very insecure about my chin.  You're not insecure about your chin.  It hurts.  It hurts what? 
[01:45:30]  The guy's balls?  It hurts.  All right, one for eight.  It hurts everybody that looks at you.  All right, you walking little troll.  Did he just say, did he say last time at the party, the only famous people there were him,  Voss, and Leary?  If you ever put yourself in the same category as Voss and Leary again when it comes to fame.  Oh, my God.  And if you ever address something I said being ironic and sarcastic as real again, I'll throw  my coffee on you.  I was kind of kidding, because I'm a nobody, so I was saying the only celebrities besides 
[01:46:00]  me and you, like implying that we're asses, which we are, and then Leary, who has a hit  show.  Last night at the party?  I'll tell you real quick.  Can you not skim over that?  I liked it.  You've got to laugh out there.  Here's the only thing fat-free in front of him.  Here's the thing.  That's a great visual for radio.  Thanks.  That doesn't matter.  There's only two guys laughing.  You're not on TV anymore.  Don't ever move milk in front of me and then go, quiet, folks.  Don't you have some ironing to do? 
[01:46:30]  Last night at the party, real quick, Sam Champion, if you don't know who he is, he's  a weatherman.  He's the gay weatherman.  In New York.  Jesus.  Was doing a thing about stand-up for this festival.  I didn't see him.  So he's on the mic and he says, you know, this whole stand-up thing is kind of cool.  I think maybe I should do it.  What do I got to do?  And he calls me over and he says, you know, what should I do?  I go, well, look, you have stage presence.  You have the looks.  The only thing you lack is humor. 
[01:47:00]  I said that to him, right?  And then I'm looking and I'm going, he's not a bad-looking guy.  I'm thinking to myself, you know, if I'm going to leave with somebody, you know what I'm  saying, a guy, Sam is my man.  That story went nowhere.  Well, because...  Well, we were distracted by the breathing.  I'm thinking you might need oxygen.  I'm just trying to get out of it.  He's scared of the daylight.  What would you have said to Sam if he had milk in front of me?  I say, did you get that from Norton's breast?  That's good.  All right, two for ten. 
[01:47:30]  Not two for ten.  One bad one and a bad story.  You've had two bad ones and then...  And about six good ones.  Eight good ones.  All right, not bad.  Can you kick high, Master Paul?  He's making me uncomfortable.  Well...  Do a kick.  Let me see.  If you don't mind, what I'd like to do is just show you exactly how I'm going to protect  you guys.  Is that all right?  Oh, yeah.  Get over there, Rester.  You can look at him and tell he's a killer.  He's the real deal.  Is that fair enough?  He's polite to everyone when they come in.  Thank you for coming.  We're glad you're here.  That's the type of guy that tears your throat out.  Yeah, Vos, get over there.  A little demonstration.  Well, I'd rather not do it with Vos because I don't want him to get hurt. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  I like him now.  Good.  And I think you're funny, by the way.  Thank you.  You're pretty hilarious.  Thank you.  So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to have my...  He is a lunatic.  My student, Marcelino, he's going to assist me.  Now, Vos is very funny.  He's just a mess.  No, you're not leaving yet.  No.  Oh, you have problems?  Okay.  That's all right.  So, we'll do this real quick.  And if you can do me a favor, commentate.  Just tell...  Of course, because it's radio.  That's our job.  We'll commentate.  All right.  So, Master Poe is going to show everybody in the studio how he's going to protect us, 
[01:48:30]  Anthony.  Yeah.  They're squaring off.  Ben, get the mic near those guys.  Master Poe, why don't you explain what you're going to do before you do it?  That might help us.  Well, look.  Over there.  It's on TV.  It's the same thing.  Oh, wow.  Look on TV.  Watch this guy get shot.  They never show him getting shot anymore.  No?  No.  No.  They cut it off right before he takes a bullet to the face, by the way.  The cops shot that hostage taker.  In Hawaii?  The Mexican consulate.  Oh, that's what that was.  Yeah.  There they go.  They shot him in the face.  Oh, is he in the face? 
[01:49:00]  Nice.  Is he dead?  Critical.  How'd they get the bullet around her fat ass?  She really was a big, awful pineapple whore.  And he was holding a starter's pistol.  A fake cap gun.  Oh, yeah.  He had a cap gun.  Oh, man.  It wasn't even a real gun.  See, look at that.  In one day, two people took it in the face.  Come on.  That wasn't bad.  That was bad.  I think you're hilarious.  What?  We love you.  You got to do backflips in here?  I got some good lines.  All right.  Here goes Master Poe.  All right.  So, basically, what's going to happen is Mussolini will attack me. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, my God.  I don't want to see this.  Wow.  I'm not going to give you the numbers as far as what I'm going to do.  Uh-huh.  Let's just say he's going to lose.  Okay.  Okay?  Are we aware of hard surfaces that could crack heads open over here?  Oh, man.  I used to love being the toughest guy in the studio.  We don't even rate anymore.  These guys are like killers.  When were you the toughest guy in the studio?  I was just going to say you.  What about Anthony?  I fought four people. 
[01:50:00]  No, I'm not putting me as tough guy in the studio, but I think Rick could have kicked  your ass.  We...  Rick could have kicked your ass.  We fought.  He would have held you down and used your nose to dock with his mule.  We fought.  We had a good fight.  You and Rick fought?  Yeah.  We did Fight Club.  I don't remember that one.  Honestly, I think he got the best of me in the end, but I held my own, and then I beat  up Frenchie really bad.  Frenchie.  Yeah, Frenchie.  That's the judge's toughest guy in the studio?  And then I...  A souffle kicked his ass in the kitchen one night.  And then I gave Paul Bond a nice black eye. 
[01:50:30]  He surrendered to Jeremy Coleman one day.  Oof.  Norris was the toughest guy.  Yeah, Norris was definitely the animal that came into the studio.  All right.  Bulldog.  Well, you know what I was saying.  We used to feel like we were men.  We're not anymore.  I mean, look at these guys.  We're cared for.  Now we're cared for.  We're cared for.  We used to be able to think we could take care of ourselves, and that's the point I'm  making.  We can't.  How long have you been training?  You've been training for a long time, too, right? 
[01:51:00]  Two years.  I'll give him some ear.  Oh, my God.  These guys are really getting into this.  Is that your defense?  Like a skunk, Voss, just rubs behind his ear and shoves it under someone's nose?  Oh, are we going to do that today?  I got some, probably.  I think I saved some up.  Don't waste it.  Who's going to take it today?  Who's going to be one of the interns?  Who hasn't?  All right.  I think I got some.  Yeah.  You think you got some good stuff?  Yeah, I think I got some saved up.  We'll do that after the break.  All right.  Go ahead, Master Poe.  By the way, Marcelino is one of my top students.  Although he hasn't said anything to you guys, he is.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm glad I didn't see him.  Oh, he's a real student? 
[01:51:30]  Look at him getting ready.  I know.  Oh, my God.  These guys aren't messing around.  I thought this was getting ready for the pain.  I didn't know he was a real student.  Oh, man.  Oh, geez.  All right.  They're shaking.  He's taking flashlights and cell phones off of a student.  Anything that can impale him.  Oh, my God.  I don't want to see this.  Are we filming this for opianthony.com?  All right.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Master Poe, he's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  It's over in a second. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  You know what?  Holy shit.  Holy...  You know what?  Yeah.  And it's got him down.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Bravo.  That was nice.  That's...  Holy...  Yes.  Oh, my...  All right.  That guy would just be like...  If that was full contact, he would just be dead.  We can't even describe it.  That was just insane.  It's a slow punch.  It's not a slow.  It's a punch to the face that Poe kind of steps out of the way at, winks at us, and then 
[01:52:30]  just begins chopping the guy's neck.  It's horrifying.  And then he just hacks at every part of his body in a split second.  When he...  When he smacked his ass...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, he's breaking his arm.  All right.  All right.  Oh, don't break his arm.  Oh, he's in pain.  All right.  I can't look at that.  Ow!  This is just a demonstration.  I can't even look at that.  That's how...  Oh, no, no, no.  Don't hurt him.  Master Poe, don't hurt his arm like that.  Oh, my God.  Master Poe, don't hurt him. 
[01:53:00]  Someone wake up, Master Poe.  Someone wake him up.  Reading Boss's...  Get Master Poe back to reality.  Reading Boss's DVD to get him more angry.  Master Poe, how do we wake him up?  Master Poe, wake up.  Master Poe.  I understand, Master Poe.  Get out of the zone.  Oh, God.  All right, don't snap his neck.  He's tapping out.  All right, he tapped out.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right, no, I think we're done.  No, no, that's good.  That's good.  That's good.  Oh, my God.  Wow, you've got to see the video.  Holy...  Master Poe goes to another place.  He just zones out.  Yeah, it was great.  Thank you, Master Poe.  Bravo. 
[01:53:30]  Now, Ben, what you were saying...  There goes Master Poe.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Very good.  That was like Stephen Spall.  Oh, my God.  Bravo.  He's for real, man.  Imagine trying to get, like, a punch in edgewise.  It just wouldn't happen.  Because your arm...  You look at the punch as an aggressive thing.  He's like, oh, great.  This extended limb can be snapped.  Of course.  And then, like, when the guy goes and attacks him,  all he does is totally disables your arms.  He's, like, hacking at your arms. 
[01:54:00]  And then, if you think you're getting out of the way of that,  an elbow will hit you in the face.  And then he'll grab the arm and twist it right off.  And then he grabbed his head and started twisting it to where he...  It was a demonstration, and Mars was definitely, like, in pain.  And he knew he was getting ready for pain, too,  because you could see he was just like, ugh.  Yeah, I've done this before, and I know what it's like.  Oh, I really have to apologize for being mean, too.  No kidding.  Oh, man.  That guy's a killer.  We've been saying it.  Oh, my God.  He's the real deal.  That's so successful.  One of the interns rats him out the other day and comes in here and goes, 
[01:54:30]  guys, I saw Master Po putting a bloody gi, which is, what, the karate top or whatever,  into a dumpster at 5 in the morning.  So we had to bring him in to ask him what that was all about.  And then he told us a story about his dog being in a dog fight  and taking the dog to the hospital.  And he told it so seriously, he goes,  do you really want to know what happened?  And we're like, uh, I guess.  So he tells this story about his dog.  Do you want to know the real truth or something?  Yeah.  So then Norton...  Aw, did Norton spray one of his defenses? 
[01:55:00]  Yes, he did.  Norton and I go to breakfast after the show,  and we talked about it for like 10, 15 minutes.  We're like, are you buying this story or what?  I mean, there's part of our brains thinking, is it real or not?  There's some dead student somewhere.  Someone who's, you know, check bounced.  Hefron's a karate.  He's like Israeli karate.  He's pretty tough, too.  Yeah, Hefron took it for a long time.  Yeah, I know.  I guess with that act, you'd have to have karate.  Hefron's hilarious.  I know.  He's funny.  We're going to get him in here next.  All right?  Oh, man, that was some scary looking... 
[01:55:30]  Wasn't that scary?  Can you imagine doing a kick like doing...  Yeah, I did it 20 years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, throw a kick at it.  Your leg would be out of the socket.  Because even if you got his...  Your move was so cute compared to what he was doing.  Wasn't it adorable?  You had such an adorable little karate kick.  Oh, I want to put ribbons in my hair.  You go to the strip mall and you see the little kids in there doing their first karate kick.  It's like watching the cute little kids through the window of a tiger showman.  And there's Voss kicking.  I think that kick could have broken a piece of balsa wood.  It was nice.  Jesus. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, honestly, it was sort of impressive until I saw that guy.  And then it puts it in perspective there.  It was cute.  He's into that hand-to-hand combat shit where he wants to grab you.  Normally, you want to just kick and run.  Pungy stick fight.  You guys want to hear...  Imagine what he can do with a sharpened stick.  Oh, yeah.  He's a weapons master, too.  Yeah, sticks, knives.  He's crazy.  He'll do a knife fight and you'll just be cut up on the floor.  That's the kind of guy you want to hang out with, though.  Of course it is.  Yeah, so you can rest assured we're getting him to the Hammerstein in case there's any problems.  Don't you want to go to a bar with him and just go to the bar and go, 
[01:56:30]  Hey, asshole, move.  Can you and that fat whore wife of yours get out of my way?  And meanwhile, it's the biggest guy at the bar.  You just walk up to him and go, Hey, dick, move.  Oh, let my friend Master Poe take care of you.  If you have any problems with me telling your pig wife to get out of the way.  No one's going to mess with him just because of that look he gives.  You know what?  With guys like that, I never talk shit to other people.  Like when I'm at Club Soda Kenny.  You don't know.  No, no.  Just because if I'm with Club Soda Kenny, I know he would defend me. 
[01:57:00]  With his life.  And I also know he's a psychopath and he would kill somebody.  It's like you don't want to get the guy you're with on a murder route.  Right.  That's why I always go, Nah, it's cool.  I would walk away.  You don't know who has a gun, too, though.  Yeah, Kenny.  Oh.  You think he's a psychopath?  He's 6'5 and skips down the sidewalk.  He's 6'5, he skips, and he's also a 20-something-year martial artist.  I would defend your honor if we were in a bar.  Voss, you'd defend it with your mouth, though.  Don't talk about him.  Don't hurt him.  I'll do whatever it takes. 
[01:57:30]  You guys want to hear the Silence of the Lambs song?  Yes.  As we go to break, I had this song in my head all night long.  Maybe that's why I didn't sleep.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Yeah.  He puts the effing lotion in the basket.  Buffalo Bill and Catherine.  We're going to get these guys on the show in the very near future.  Steve found them.  He did?  Yeah, it's these two guys from California.  They did the Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  That's great.  And they're sending us a better copy, matter of fact.  Nice.  Because we got this off the Internet.  And they send great files over the Internet, don't they now? 
[01:58:00]  Or a fucking poodle in the trash.  Dude, I could not stop listening to the replay I heard as I caught it.  It was great.  Well, let's listen to it again, okay?  He's doing some karate moves.  Want Master Poe back in here?  I'll do it myself.  What was that, though?  He's doing karate moves with a pack of Marlboro in one hand and the lighter in the other.  Oh, brother.  All right, let's check this song again.  Master Nicotine.  Vos.  Master Poe. 
[01:58:30]  All right, let's take a listen to this again.  This thing is great.  It's fucking hilarious.  Here's the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing, a simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket. 
[01:59:00]  All these group of women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them bitch instead of by their names.  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  Most of you, so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying now, you bitch, fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin. 
[01:59:30]  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining.  So write down before I jam them off.  Write down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to your screaming whale. 
[02:00:00]  Keep it down, you fucking whale.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed.  Precious.  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket. 
[02:00:30]  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you it.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head. 
[02:01:00]  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  In a world without vibrators...  Honey, can I wash your socks for sex?  Please?  Women are tortured.  Please?  Please?  Just this one time.  Come on.  Pretty please?  You can put it anywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, yeah, even there. 
[02:01:30]  Just fuck me!  Women are brought to the brink of insanity.  Um, I'll invite all my friends over and we'll clean the house topless.  Just, if you'll just have sex with me.  Just please, please have sex with me.  Anyway, just do me right now.  Please, please.  God, I can't take it another day.  I miss my pocket rockets so much.  In a world without vibrators...  A cucumber.  Yeah, that's all I need.  I need a cucumber. 
[02:02:00]  That's it.  And I'll be fine.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  God forbid they should put a few radio stations anywhere between here and Salt Lake City, for God's sake.  You hit your scan button, it's like playing roulette without the ball.  It just spins and spins.  Get a choice of static or national public radio.  Let me flip a fucking coin.  You're now listening to national public radio. 
[02:02:30]  We'll now go live to Liechtenstein for a concert from a cafe where Jan's Choska-Honovan-Avonovitz is playing the dulcimer strung only with scrotum hair.  This is national public radio.  Don't fall asleep at the wheel.  I blew a speaker in my car today.  That sucked. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, he was a motivational speaker.  Left a bad taste in my mouth, but I feel a lot more positive.  It's the weirdest thing.  I am.  Oh my gracious.  You know what I hate?  The one thing I hated growing up more than anything else, I hated being tickled.  Tickling is the worst.  Because it started off fun. 
[02:03:30]  Right?  Tickling started.  Tickling!  Let's tickle!  Started fun.  Ended horribly.  Didn't it always escalate the same way?  At first you'd be like,  I can't breathe.  I can't breathe.  Cut it out.  Stop it.  I'm going to throw up.  And they couldn't stop.  They were like,  I don't care.  I had to punch my grandmother in the chest to get her off me. 
[02:04:00]  A minute with Bob Edwards and Doc Watson.  You know, if you hadn't boarded that bus for the coffee houses of New York and Boston and all back in 62 at the peak of the folk revival,  what would you have done?  Would you have played dances back in North Carolina?  I would have, but I would never have been a success just doing that. 
[02:04:30]  I did quite a few trips to New York on that Trailways Express that ran from Memphis up to Port Authority Station there in New York by myself.  I wouldn't have them there if they do that now.  The Bob Edwards Show on XMPR, Channel 133, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. Pacific. 
[02:05:00]  Well, Bob, it's been a pleasure.  We'll do it again sometime.  I appreciate it.  Is that enough?  Yeah, I think that's fine.  It's everything 24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  On the O.P. and Anthony Show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle hoping candy comes out and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck. 
[02:05:30]  The O&A show.  You better go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Yeah.  Go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now go away.  Boss doing those Sully height kicks that he was doing before.  Reaching the top of Sully's little head.  Speaking of Godsmack, they're going to be in the studio maybe within the next few weeks 
[02:06:00]  doing a little acoustic set for us, and their DVD's out.  It's great.  We have Martini Steve back in the studio.  Yeah.  And he was observing Master Poe during the commercial break.  What was going on?  That little...  Sorry.  Martini Steve.  Uh-huh.  That.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  He's so annoyed.  Really. 
[02:06:30]  I just wish it would go away.  A lot of the listeners are with you on that show, but tough shit.  All right.  That little display from Master Poe and Mars, that was no bullshit.  He's out in his cubicle, or he was during the break, decompressing.  He's in a zone.  And if Mars hadn't tapped his leg like he did, he would have kept going.  He would have kept going until Mars' arms snapped.  That's what he does.  He keeps going.  You've got to tap out.  And then when he's done, he had to go to his cubicle and, like, wind down, or he'd just 
[02:07:00]  stay in this mood.  Destructive mood.  Yeah.  You can see it in his eyes.  Yeah.  He goes to another place when he's doing that stuff.  Yeah.  Eric asked him about some paperwork or something, and Master Poe was like, just give me a minute.  Give me a couple of minutes.  Yeah.  And he shut his eyes and just kind of breathe and calm down.  Where the hell did XM Satellite Radio get this guy from?  He's fantastic.  Like a trained assassin.  He has to come to events and everything.  There has to be one lister he can strangle.  Wouldn't that be great to see?  Just see that in full contact.  A listener, screw that.  How about a staff member? 
[02:07:30]  Imagine that in full contact?  Yeah.  Watching someone just get put down in a second?  But even that play stuff.  He really hurt Mars' hand.  Play.  That was no play.  Well, I mean, you know, the half-ass punch Mars threw, he blocked it with his elbow, and  Mars smashed his arm right into it.  I've heard that these guys practice during the whole show.  Yeah.  If you watch during the show, they go off into Poe's office, Master Poe's office, and they'll  just start sparring with each other, and they'll really, really do semi-full contact  stuff until they're both winded and hurt.  There's all kinds of stuff going on here. 
[02:08:00]  But Poe is his instructor.  Yeah.  You know what?  When we clear out this whole studio, and we have all that open space,  outside, we ought to put a little section over there where we can have a mat.  I don't want to see it.  And a heavy bag or something.  Oh, I do.  No way.  We get Taylor Law in here, or someone really hot like that, and you say,  if you can put Poe down, this girl will blow you.  Hey, you get takers.  That's right.  And then watch me take a swing at it.  Catch my beating like a man, and receive my Hummer in the hospital.  Let's get John Heffron in here, man.  Yeah, bring him.  You know somebody, too, will try to test him after they hear that? 
[02:08:30]  You know when Tyson was a person, there's so much how to test.  Do you think against a boxer, like a pro, like who would win, do you think?  Like, you know, the master or, like, say, a golden glove?  No.  Yeah, boxers are really only for their own environment.  Yeah.  Take them out of that.  Gracie and those guys murder boxers.  They just grab you by the legs or by the arm and twist your grapple.  Grapple you up and then twist your arm out of its socket like a turkey leg.  Gracie won't punch at first until he gets you down. 
[02:09:00]  That's the thrill of it for him.  He doesn't want to punch.  Like, he won't throw a punch at your face.  He'll tie you up so you can't move.  They get on you like a web and you're just stuck there and then they take an elbow and  just start pounding your face in with an elbow.  It's great to watch.  I love those.  Ultimate fighting.  I hear you're pretty good, too.  That's what I hear.  No, I suck.  But I love it, though.  I'm like a fan.  Are you a fan?  I know all those guys in Gracie and Boss Root and Tito Ortiz, all the huge UFC guys and 
[02:09:30]  stuff like that.  There was a point where the Gracies used to be able to beat everyone's ass because nobody  knew how to ground fight.  Right?  Those guys would take a punch and then they'd end up screwing you on the ground.  But now it's kind of evolved to the point where now people kind of know how to ground  fight and, you know, jiu-jitsu doesn't necessarily always win.  So there's other people that are kicking their ass now?  Yeah, jiu-jitsu's great if you're in that type of environment.  You're at a bar and let's say I'm a black belt in jiu-jitsu and I'm going to, you know,  take your elbow and somehow put it through your rectum and out your mouth is good if 
[02:10:00]  you didn't go to the bar with a buddy of yours.  So why I'm doing that to you, your buddy is teeing off on my face and, you know, stomping  me into the ground.  That's true.  The bar fight things, usually there is a buddy involved.  Yeah.  So, I mean, there's, you know.  But can't those jiu-jitsu guys, they can also punch real quick, too.  I mean, like, they can wrap you up, but they can also snap your arm real quick and  then go about their business to your friend.  Your buddy.  Yeah.  What's the difference?  Isn't that like Hapkido or isn't that what he just did?  Hapkido?  Yeah, Hapkido, right?  There's Hapkido, there's Akido, then there's Hapkido, which is Korean, which is using the 
[02:10:30]  person's...  Why am I talking like Daniel Sunker?  Do you know Gracie's personally?  You know those people like...  Not personally, no.  Do you think the ultimate fighting guys are telling jokes right now somewhere?  I just don't like the fact that Voss is asking fourth grade questions.  Are they personal friends of yours?  Yes.  I'm just setting them up so you can get a picture with them, okay, stupid?  Okay?  I'm just looking out for you so you can run behind them with your camera. 
[02:11:00]  Who do you think would win?  God or karate expert?  No.  Honestly, in a race, if it was between Kit and Herbie the Love Bug, which one would win?  How long did you take it for?  I've done what I do for maybe two and a half, three years.  But the problem with what they don't incorporate in the training is guys who stay out to four  and lose.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Eventually, I don't care how good of a martial artist you are, if you smoke and drink, you're 
[02:11:30]  done in about 90 seconds just because your body's going to go, no, dude, you're a tool.  You don't take care of yourself.  I'm going to make sure nothing works.  Yeah.  And also, the toughest guy always wins.  I will completely tell you, I'm a huge wuss.  As much as I spar and stuff like that, I don't have that thing inside of me that I'm not a mean...  Yeah, I don't have that mean guy thing, right, where guys who don't even know how to fight  that just maybe their dads weren't around enough.  Well, we saw that when you cried on TV.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly. 
[02:12:00]  So there you go.  I cried on TV.  I didn't even...  Did he really cry?  What show was that?  It wasn't a...  Yeah, that's what it was.  I was trying to get the soccer mom's vote on the...  What show was that?  Oh, the second season.  Oh, the second season.  Yeah, the second season.  Everyone watched the first season.  On the second season, you had to cry to win or advance.  Oh, is that it?  It's the only house that had a lifeguard in it.  They cry so much.  The second season was very popular, too.  Shut up.  I'm talking short.  I like the second season of Last County State.  It was very popular.  It was nice.  I cried, but now I'm independently wealthy, so I will take the tears and the ridicule. 
[02:12:30]  And then next week, I'm buying a Lexus Cash.  Now you can cry, stupid.  1951 Mercedes.  Start crying.  Well, I should cry.  I'm a Saturn.  Faggot sedan.  Here's your Saturn, sir.  Thank you.  Oh, that's fine.  All right.  Boss is Reggie.  He had to trade it over from, it said Adolf Hitler on it.  I'm going to get another one now.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A new one?  Yeah, well, I'll probably get like a 2001 or something. 
[02:13:00]  You like the classics?  I can't buy a new Mercedes because I'm a Jew, so I'm not going to put money back into their  economy.  So you think buying it used...  Buying it used, it's already paid for, so I'm going to put money back into the economy.  Really?  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not realizing that once somebody sells it to you, they're going to go out and spend 90  grand on a new one.  On a grand new one.  So you're putting not only the 40 you'd probably spend on a new one, but the 90 that they're  going to spend.  So you're putting a lot more back in the German economy.  He'd be one of the guys that pulled the dead bodies out of the gas chamber. 
[02:13:30]  And you know, I wasn't putting them in.  I'm just clearing them out.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Making room for the new ones.  Or, no.  Couldn't you spend 30 on like an F10 pickup and give it to people in Tennessee?  What's an F10?  No, I'm a Mercedes driver.  I'm a headliner.  I can't be driving a pickup.  I'm going to look good.  I'm a big act.  Are you kidding me?  You really getting a Lexus?  Mm-mm.  Oh.  He's doing really...  No.  I really want a nice new car.  I told you to get a nice new car.  I told him, I said, look, you're doing well.  He's, you know, he was selling out theaters, this creep, was selling out theaters. 
[02:14:00]  We remember, until we fucked it up for him.  Yep.  No, he still did all right after you guys.  It's not like you guys were the only thing in the world.  You know, we have other things going on.  Yeah, no, you're right.  They weren't the only thing in the world when I was in Orlando doing 50 people on a Thursday  night.  No, you're right.  Who needs these two?  It's so funny.  His middle name.  Oh, 25 of them comps.  Exactly, yeah.  Radio station comps.  His real name should be Stepping Stone.  He didn't even talk to Colin last night at Colin's farewell party. 
[02:14:30]  He knew Colin was done.  Because I don't know what a farewell party...  Oh, I said it right.  You said it right.  I meant to muffle off when I said it right.  Because you said a farewell party.  And I'm like, I don't even know what a farewell party is.  Oh, yes, I do.  It's a farewell party.  A farewell party.  Jerry Falwell's party?  What?  So, were you pissed...  I've got to ask half a question.  Were you pissed because you won season two, and there's all that cash out there, and then  they rush right into season three.  Were you kind of mad that, like...  No time to bask.  Yeah, it's right, right, right.  It sucked because I was offered, like, not a lot of television, but more television than 
[02:15:00]  I've ever done before.  But they said I couldn't do it because it would give me an advantage on season three.  So, that kind of got crapped on.  And then they made me do season three, and even a prom queen gets to be the queen for  a year.  Yeah, you got nothing.  So, yeah, I really didn't want to do season...  Wow, that does suck.  I didn't want to do season three.  So, yeah, I was kind of bummed.  They just wrecked that franchise by throwing that third season out there.  Yeah, plus...  That's too bad.  Yeah, with me, it was a tough call because you're like, I'm like, well, I don't want  to do it because I'd kind of rather do some other shows to kind of... 
[02:15:30]  But then they said, well, you're not allowed to.  So, then it's a tough call.  You go, well, I'm going to turn down national television.  I mean, I'm not at that level yet, but on the same token, I probably should have or wish  I could have.  Wow.  You could have turned...  You know what?  I mean, I probably could have.  No, I could have said, yeah, but, you know, it's tough to go, yeah, dang it, I'm going  to not do primetime NBC.  I'll show you.  Yeah.  But in your contract in the second season, couldn't you have said, if I win, I had the 
[02:16:00]  stipulation not to do season three?  Did I say stipulation?  No, you said contract.  I said contract.  Contract.  It's a great...  It's a thing you sign and then eat if you have a cold.  Contract.  What did I say?  Contract.  Tiny little time release paperwork.  Whatever.  You can't get...  Listen, it's just a word.  Really, people put too much emphasis on words.  That's it.  Voss just diffused the whole thing.  It's just a word. 
[02:16:30]  It's just a word.  Voss makes me laugh.  You know what?  I'll tell you what sucks.  At least Heffron, people know, I mean, everybody knows who he is.  He won, and season two was a big hit.  On season three, they didn't even show the winner.  They canceled the last episode.  Canceled the show before the last episode.  Yeah, who won?  I forgot.  People come up to me and say, well, they'll come up to me at shows and go, who won?  And I go, I did.  Right?  You might as well.  Sure.  They don't know.  Alonzo, you know, I mean, listen, to cancel the last episode, he would have made more 
[02:17:00]  money in clubs with people knowing he won.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He got a host, too.  You know, people not knowing.  But they still know you, though, man.  You're still doing good.  They all know you from the season two and season three.  Yeah.  And, you know, even people who came on and saw me would go, you're on season three?  Yeah.  You don't watch?  No.  We won't.  You know, it's different.  Yeah, I'm not complaining.  It was too much.  It was like, yeah, you get season one, season two, and then they threw in that lame season  three.  It was too much.  That was the network, I think, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of like probably finishing yourself off and continue to watch the porn. 
[02:17:30]  It's just dumb.  Yeah.  There's really no reason for it.  You need to just stop and then set it away for when you're in the mood again.  Right.  That's how I do it.  That might be 20 minutes later, but, you know, there's got to be some kind of.  But if you keep watching it, it's a waste.  Yeah.  And nobody enjoys it.  Completely.  Nobody.  You want to go to.  Your season won 50 grand every week.  What was that?  Just spanking.  And season two won 50 grand every week back in season one.  Just, you know, there was one week.  Wow.  What?  I don't know.  I swear to God. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know.  I'm going to make.  What did you just say?  You know, it's just these earphones.  I couldn't hear myself.  You should have saw the look.  I'm trying to follow.  You said something about 50 grand a week.  50 grand.  Yeah.  Season two won 50 grand a week against season one.  On season three, it was a head-to-head competition, head-to-head as in competing, and they  won 50 grand every week.  And this is how popular season two was, that one week, Ralphie, Dave, Dad, me, like the  four most known from season one went up against, you know, and they still beat us for 50 grand. 
[02:18:30]  I'm just saying.  I think that's the fan.  You guys are the ones who brought up the dumb show.  I'm not.  I'm listening.  I just didn't know what you were saying.  You know.  Season two is bigger.  I think that's the fan brought all he is down, is what it was.  Brought the average of the whole first season down.  How you were second place to that.  I wasn't second.  I was third.  Third.  Ralphie was second.  Sorry.  Yeah, but you know, it is only a kid.  Sorry, I thought you were second.  No, Ralphie was.  Ralphie.  Oh, you did come in third.  I came in third.  Who cares?  You should have won.  Of those three, Ralphie's funny, but you should have won.  Dad doesn't care about it, but you should have won.  Every season I should have won.  I'm the biggest veteran on those shows.  What are you kidding me? 
[02:19:00]  I mean, the kid's all right over here.  Alonzo's okay.  But this kid's all right.  He's not a bad guy.  You know, you're kidding.  He's a like guy.  He's a like guy.  He's funny.  I like his energy and stuff.  But shit, I'm a fucking legend, okay?  I've done a lot of shit in this fucking business.  Deb Jam, Rosie.  I've done it all.  You know, these guys, they do what?  Deb Jam, Rosie?  I did from Deb Jam to Rosie.  I hosted Woodstock.  You know, this isn't some fucking just because I was in a contest.  You know, it's Rick Voss.  I went to the contest.  It was Rick Voss.  I've been to several comedy clubs where actually the Caesar salad is called the Rich Voss Caesar 
[02:19:30]  salad.  I'm telling you.  Rick Voss.  And they spell it wrong.  Yeah.  And that's how you determine if you made it as a comic is if you get some of the munchies  you know, named after.  I'm looking for the heifer and chicken tenders.  That would be a proud moment.  That the MC has the plug.  God, I wish I could think of something funny to connect with a comic to food.  No one's known after the scallop because he's boneless.  You didn't have to explain why.  No one is looking at me going, why would he say scallop? 
[02:20:00]  There's no bone in that.  That's odd.  And known after the scallop.  Am I known after the scallop?  That's right.  I'm post-scallop.  John, you want some Jaeger bites?  A.S.  I was looking at that.  That's the real deal, yeah.  I was told that, but is it plugged in?  Oh, we got it.  It's cold.  I don't think I could do Jaeger.  You want to do a shot?  It ices it up to five degrees.  Five degrees.  Where's your show?  What time is your show?  Tonight? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Be it like 11 at night or 10 o'clock.  Caroline's.  There's like two shows tonight because there's some other thing going on because of the comedy festival.  Oh, okay.  Then there's a sexual.  Last time I did Jaeger, I think it was, Jaeger's that one booze, you know, if you do too much where you know at the end of that night you go.  I probably took a year off my, or a day off my life.  Jaeger's one of them.  I passed out in a stall of a bathroom with Jaeger once.  Jaeger Meister's the black death.  Even if I smell it out.  Like whiskey or booze?  It's like a liquor.  It's almost licorice flavored. 
[02:21:00]  I love the people at Jaeger Meister, but it's not one of my faves.  What is it, Lance?  I love the Jaeger.  Like Zambuca?  Huh?  It's like Zambuca?  No, not that much.  Licorice is the best way to.  Yeah.  And usually the people doing Jaeger have the words Amber Crumby and Fitch written on some part of their body with shell necklaces.  Right.  Still very good.  I mean, but it's like a college drink.  Yeah, definitely.  But then some people still do it.  I don't want to bust the people who gave me Jaeger.  A lot of people still do it.  I remember the worst drink was tequila, though. 
[02:21:30]  I'm a huge tequila fan.  Man.  I'm little, but I can drink a lot of tequila.  I woke up on the floor of the bathroom at home one day.  It was, you know, one morning you just wake up and go, why the hell am I on the bathroom floor?  And then it all starts slowly coming back to you.  Yeah, I remember kind of coming in.  I remember that.  Oh, tequila.  A lot of shots.  And then you're just horrified going out and looking where and how your car was parked.  I've been doing this thing a lot lately.  Coke? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  You guys try that?  Yeah.  I'm relatively new to it.  Do you snort it or smoke it?  I snort it.  That's pussy.  Listen to me.  To be a good Coke addict, you've got to, like, sell your mom's stereo and suck a cock.  Then you know that you're doing Coke.  You're such a good addict.  You forgot the stereo, but you sucked a cock in recovery.  In recovery?  I'm sober three years, but what the hell?  You used to smoke it, Rich?  Oh, yeah.  Freebase?  What are you kidding me?  Where did you get?  I always get mad watching people that snort it because it's like knitting a foot backwards. 
[02:22:30]  It is.  It's like, you know, I can tell you something.  One time, I go, I mean, this is a light one.  My friend, I go, do you really think you're going home with those new sneakers?  You know, and that coat?  You know, get rid of it.  We're selling it.  You know.  You would sell your clothing.  Oh, Vos was the real deal.  Oh, is this a real story?  This is real?  Oh, yeah.  Vos used to be.  I wore Coke stories.  Oh, I didn't know.  What do you call?  One time, someone, okay, I owe these drug dealers money, so they torched my mother's car. 
[02:23:00]  Like, they just burnt her car, right?  That's real?  Yeah, they torched her car because I owed them money.  I said, you know, so I called them.  I said, look, now not only do we get insurance, I'm not giving you the goddamn money, right?  So she goes out and gets a new car, right?  And I have it.  She lets me in New York.  So I'm driving, and someone smashes into it, right, and just wrecks the whole side, and  I go to that person, look, just give me $100, and I'll let you go.  And they gave me $100, and I just went and copped 10 vials, and I told my mom, I don't  know, somebody hit your car, parked in the street.  Oh, man, you let them go for $100. 
[02:23:30]  Hey, listen, when you're going to cop, and you're going over to GW, and once you get  over, and you got another $100, plus what you take out of the other people's vials that  you're running in for.  Of course you take it.  A little for yourself.  You dip out of every single one.  Oh, man.  They must have seen you get out of the car with that awful long hair, and oh, this junky  motherfucker.  Here's $8, okay?  Oh, the pictures we saw here with the jerry curl and the bad teeth and everything?  You know the fake, how they had those fake $50 advertisement bills? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, you'd see them laying on the ground, and go, what's this?  I used to, we used to wrap like 10 singles around it.  I'd pull up on the guy, and I'd go, give me six vials, and I'd count it like this away  from him, and I'd hand it to him and just drive away, give him the fake $50.  One time I tried to grab it out of his hand, and he punched me in the face twice.  This is a true story.  I snatched it out of his hand, right?  He punched me twice in the face, and I'm going, oh, did he?  So I drove away.  This is true.  And I opened my hand.  I had like three vials.  I got them.  Oh, you got it.  So I'm all excited. 
[02:24:30]  This is true.  I pull down the street, right?  And I get like two miles down the road.  I throw it in the pipe, and I hit it, and it was soap, right?  The son of a bitch got you back.  You know, you pull it back, and I'm like, look, you don't rip me off when I'm ripping  you off.  It was the deal.  No honor.  No honor.  But why would he punch me in the head twice for stealing soap?  Because he could have sold that soap.  Right?  It's on principle.  I'm new to the whole drug thing.  Like, I wasn't a big druggie.  Yeah.  But then I've had a couple nights recently because of the stress, and this is where I 
[02:25:00]  decided I'm never doing it again.  I was doing, and you know, now I look at the tops of the toilet paper holder every time  I go into a stall, because, you know, before I was naive, I'm like, what takes dudes so  long?  You know, just rip and piss.  But I realized that that's where they're doing their lines and stuff, and I was so screwed  up.  I looked on the floor, because I was totally out, and I looked on the floor, and I saw a bunch  of white stuff.  I'm like, oh, somebody brushed it off, and it fell on the floor, but there's a crap load  there, and I went down there and took my finger and went like that, and I whatever, and it 
[02:25:30]  was like cleaning.  You can tell it was Clorox, you know, like Ajax or something like that, and I went, okay,  I probably have a problem, and then I mess up.  So I was a drug addict for maybe two and a half weeks.  If you're snorting coke from the floor, that isn't even coke.  That's bad.  That's a bad sign?  I was like, you might be a drug addict.  You might be a drug addict if you've seen this act.  If you've seen it more than once and laughed, you might be a drug addict. 
[02:26:00]  I see a bumper sticker coming.  We used to, me and my brother used to sell out of the house, and the people that would  come to the door with everything, you know, I have stereos.  One guy brought a huge, you know, from the water coolers, the big bottles of water that  you put in a water cooler full of pennies on a hand truck, and he's banging on the door,  it's like two in the morning, guys, guys, like what, no, you gotta, we need cash, we 
[02:26:30]  need cash, can't be taking that.  Stereos, cars, anything.  I just maybe thought of an internet company you could start maybe called E, what's, not  zoning, E, what, I see the joke going on.  Kind of like eBay, but where people can give up stuff just to get drugs.  So you don't bid for it, yeah.  Like a barter system?  Yeah, where people can just sign up.  Where you can sign up that big jug full of pennies for cocaine?  Yeah, and then you send it to them.  It might work.  It would have been funnier if I could have remembered it. 
[02:27:00]  I was thinking like E, Jonesing.  We were with you though, man.  We went with it for a while.  It was there for a little bit.  I was hanging.  I'm like, yeah.  We're like, sounds like a little more help here.  I fell short.  He did.  Boss, when did you decide to get help?  Was there one story where you said, I got it.  Yeah, I could tell you a story.  If you got one minute, I'll run through this quick.  We have an hour in a head.  The burning mom's car wasn't the problem.  No, this is a true story.  God, your mom, did she hate you for that?  Well, you know, I'm her kid.  How could she?  I was her favorite. 
[02:27:30]  Because my brother and sister were really fucked up.  Here's the thing.  How could they be more fucked up than that?  No, I'm just kidding.  I was real.  Here's the deal.  I'll tell you a couple.  One time.  No, I'll tell you the bottom story.  No, tell us a couple.  And then finish with the big one.  At one time, I called my father.  This is not even a bad story.  But just at like 3 in the morning.  No, maybe like 11 at night.  And I call him.  I go, can I come over?  And I go, can I have $20?  I got to get a gallon of paint.  11 o'clock at night.  I told him, I need a gallon of paint.  A gallon of paint.  He obviously. 
[02:28:00]  Look at his son.  He obviously wasn't buying it, right?  I had a painting.  But here's the bottom story.  The real.  It was like 7 o'clock.  I had no money.  Someone calls me.  I go into New York for him.  I cop, whatever.  And I come home.  I end up with six vials of crack.  I smoke them all by 10.  Then I go back in, right, with my other friends.  This is true.  As we're going in.  We're going down Route 1 and 9.  In like a Z100 or whatever.  Whatever.  I'm not lying.  We just wipe the car out. 
[02:28:30]  Spin.  Take down one of those metal light posts.  On 1 and 9.  All the wheels are off the car.  The car's crushed, right?  None of us are hurt.  We run.  Report the car stolen.  And take another car in.  So that's my second trip.  You know, and I do like maybe five more vials and come back out.  Now wait.  Now I'm like, now I'm going to pick up a friend of mine who's a comic.  Now I'm going to go pick up my friend who's a comic at the airport, right?  I pick him up.  We go in the city.  He cops heroin.  And I cop like five more vials, right? 
[02:29:00]  Because he had money.  I didn't have any money at all the whole night.  This is my third trip in now from Jersey.  I can't even get a cab today.  How are you getting the vials with no money?  The first one, I went and copped for somebody.  So I made money, you know, to do it.  The second one, my friends were going in and they were treating.  And it was like, you know, four or five vials to hang out with them.  Treating.  Like treating.  You know, just to hang out.  And I took them to the spot, too.  I was taking them to.  I treat people for a lunch.  What the fuck?  This is true story.  The third trip we go in, we cop like, you know, maybe six more vials, seven. 
[02:29:30]  I'm driving home.  I drop him off.  And I'm driving down 22 after I smoked all night.  And the sun's coming up.  And I get this pain in my stomach, right?  So I pull over.  I walk into the hotel on 22 and I fall on the floor.  They call me an ambulance, right?  They take me to the hospital because I had, like, a kidney stone.  So I didn't think I was dying.  And they shoot me with, like, they give me, like, morphine and Demerol or something, right?  I wake up, right?  I leave the hospital and I go back to New York. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, no.  Right back to it.  Right back to it.  And then I said, you know what?  Maybe I should go to rehab.  What was wrong with your stomach?  A kidney stone.  A kidney stone.  So, you know, I mean, stories like that where you just keep going and don't stop.  Yeah.  He's whacking off the doctor to get the drugs.  He's like, no, dude, I would give this to you anyway.  It's just good.  What do I owe you?  It's free.  No, dude, it's part of it.  We give morphine.  Yeah, that's what we do here at the hospital.  You don't got to burn my mom's car, are you?  No, dude, really.  It's aspirin. 
[02:30:30]  It's good.  I worked in Boston.  I met a girl.  There was a club at Worcester called Plums.  Worcester?  Worcester.  Worcester?  Yeah, Worcester, whatever.  That's what your grammar is compared to everyone else's.  You make me sound like an English major.  I love when you come in.  What's the problem?  It's just a word.  Wow.  Worcester?  That's great.  What's it called?  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.  Oh, wow.  Then I drove to Boston.  Oh, my God.  Worcester. 
[02:31:00]  Worcester.  I love them.  How do you not love them?  Just say New England.  We'll know where you're talking about.  Met some girl, waitress.  Yeah.  I said, I'm not going to get high in your night.  I'm going to save my money.  I meet her up there.  I drive.  This is no lie.  I drive all.  She goes, do you do coke?  I go, yeah.  She was a hot waitress.  Pick her up.  I go, can you cop?  And she couldn't find anywhere in Boston.  I go, I know a spy.  I drive down to New York from Boston.  Oh, no.  I'm not lying.  I pull in. 
[02:31:30]  We get all kinds of crack and coke.  We get one of those hotels in Jersey on like one and nine.  It's like fleece-stricken.  I'm banging her and doing coke and this and that.  Then I'm driving her back.  We're trying to get heroin and stuff just to calm the nerves.  Right.  Just snorted.  What a mess.  You never told these stories earlier.  This is amazing.  Taco Bell was close.  As we're driving, my nose just sort of blood started going.  Sit down my face.  How are you alive?  You got to do six hours of driving on a coke binge? 
[02:32:00]  After the night before, I was trying to come down and she's crying because she's going to be late for work.  My face is bloody and I'm all over my clothes.  And then she goes, her and her sister wanted to get an ounce of coke and they were going to give you a couple of grand and I was just going to rob her and rip her off.  Of course.  And I didn't do it.  And then like five years later, I was performing in Florida and she was there with a big guy, boyfriend at the time.  Would have kicked your ass.  They would have killed me.  You know, what I would have thought that I, you know, I used to go on the road all the time and tell people, you know, give me a gram on credit and I'll pay you, you know, Sunday night after the gig. 
[02:32:30]  But, you know, I'm already out of town.  You're gone.  I'm done.  How many people fronted you?  The last show is Saturday.  Yeah, if I'm not there on Sunday, the last show is Saturday, stupid.  If you would draw, then you would know that.  Here's the thing.  Well, no, I do Sunday shows.  I don't have to bail out Saturday.  We have Thursday through Sunday.  You're right.  Sorry, stupid.  The money I make, I only have to do Friday and Saturday.  Now, my question was, did you leave after the show Sunday or would you bail out Saturday?  No, no, I would get Saturday night after the show.  Okay, so now instead of ripping off Coke dealers, you're ripping off customers. 
[02:33:00]  Ten bucks.  Listen to it on the way home.  That's amazing stuff, man.  It's amazing.  You were really a crackhead, man.  Well, I was a drug addict.  How did you, you bought from the real dregs, though?  Did you go into the brother neighborhoods?  I used to go up to 168th and after.  I had keys to the front doors of the buildings.  They gave me keys.  And one night we were going to, me and a connie, this connie used to get high. 
[02:33:30]  Frank, you didn't know Frank.  You know Frank Bastille?  Did you know who's a heroin addict?  How did they not just rob you?  Well, we went up one night and we were running out of money.  So we hooked up with this Puerto Rican guy.  And he said, well, look, I got a shotgun.  Why don't we kick a door open and just rob him?  We said, yeah, that sounds good.  Hey, there you go.  But I'm telling you, he goes to get a shotgun and we're driving to go.  And I said, you know what?  We can't do this because they have lookouts now.  I go, this is crazy.  They'll kill us.  So we blew that idea out.  Wow.  Good.  I can tell you. 
[02:34:00]  Pussy.  But wait.  The story when you had the gallstone, you're passing the crack pipe.  Yeah.  Is that when you went, you know what, I'm done?  It's over for me.  Yeah.  That was the day.  And then the next day, you didn't do anything else?  Well, I had maybe another week.  But that was, you know.  And then you went someplace, some farm somewhere.  I called this guy at Books Rooms.  I said, look, I'm going to rehab tomorrow.  Give me a gig tonight.  And he gave me a gig.  It was $60.  I did the gig.  Went and bought six vials.  I smoked them until the morning, right, until the sun came up.  My mother drove me to rehab, and I never got high since. 
[02:34:30]  I just want to see those little stiff fingers trying to work a shotgun as five Jamaicans are  running at you with butcher knives.  That's it.  These aren't lies.  These are true stories.  When David Spade started comedy, he came up from Arizona, and he was in New York.  He was just a timid little guy who did props.  So we were doing a one-nighter in Jersey.  Me, Frankie, and him.  And he was just this little white kid from Arizona.  Little blind.  If Opie was 12, you know what I mean?  Just a little.  Yeah, hot.  You know.  So we do the gig. 
[02:35:00]  We're driving back.  And we're driving back, you know, to drop him off in New York.  And me and Frankie, we go, well, look, we've got to make a stop first.  So I take him up.  And this is, I take him to 160th, right?  You scumbag.  I'm getting out of the car.  It's the truth.  Someone's chasing another guy with a knife.  And he's scared.  And he goes, the guy's got a knife.  I go, he's not after me.  What do I care?  And get out.  Then, frankly, take him down to the East Village where Frankie copped heroin.  Now, Frankie's in the back.  Quick cash. 
[02:35:30]  Frankie's in the back seat.  Look at that ass.  I'm driving him back.  And Frankie's, you know, shooting up.  What a great first experience.  He's dead, right, Frankie?  Yeah, Frankie's dead.  Yeah, I don't know.  His father died.  Frankie was such a screw-up.  His father died.  And then two days later, he died.  So they didn't know what to do with him.  So they, you know, they cremated him.  And they just threw him in his father's casket under the pillow.  So, what the heck?  Are you serious?  No.  Holy ass. 
[02:36:00]  What did he die of?  Yeah, the guy was doing heroin forever.  Did he OD?  Oh.  I think he had a heart attack.  That's awful.  When did he die?  You know, when he stopped breathing.  No, what year?  You did not just say that.  Funny.  Yeah, what year?  It's the only word.  I don't know.  I don't know if he was trying to be doing it.  Stumbling under the pillow.  Yeah, there's father.  They didn't know what to do with him.  Because they didn't want to have two funerals.  So they just put him under the pillow in his father's coffin.  That's how you know your family is sick of your drug use. 
[02:36:30]  Nah, just throw him under the fucking pillow.  Put him under there and plant him with dad.  Who cares?  Wow.  I hope I didn't bring everybody down with those.  No, that's a good story.  Very interesting.  So it makes you never want to do drugs before?  You're kind of going, you know what?  My weekend's boring.  I might have to ramp it up a little.  How did you do, like, six vials, though?  After, like, the first hit, it's pretty much over for the night.  Yeah, can I ask that dumb question?  I've never, obviously, done that.  When you do one rock, like, how long are you high for? 
[02:37:00]  You know what I mean?  You smoke one for a rush.  It's not really a high.  You get a rush.  It's like a rush.  Oh, so it doesn't last that long at all?  No.  And then the rest of the night is spent trying to get the feeling that you got from the first rush,  but it never happens.  You got to, like, go to sleep, wait a whole day, get some more, and do it that way, although  I never smoked crack.  I never, uh, I'm one of those guys, look, I never smoked crack.  Yeah, right?  I got limited shit in the house. 
[02:37:30]  We'd have, like, a chemistry set set up.  It's the same thing, though.  It was, no, it was ether and ammonia.  Oh, you did the ether.  And we put it in with the water.  You put the coke in.  And then you heat it up a little bit.  And then you take an eyedropper all the way down to the bottom of the vial, and then you  pull out the, um, the ether.  Yeah.  And you spread it out on a slate.  And then you blow on it.  The ether evaporates immediately, and you're left behind with this white residue.  You scrape it up with a razor blade.  Look at Voss smiling.  This is so good.  He's smiling at me like, this shit is so good. 
[02:38:00]  Look at Voss.  And then you put it in the pipe.  Tell me again, but tell me slow.  You put it in the pipe on the screen, and then you give it a quick, like, with the  heat so it melts on the screen.  And then you give it a hit.  And then you get that big rush.  It's like, whoa, man.  Holy shit.  You blow out.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Look, Voss is sweating.  He's wiping his head.  He's sweating, and he has a boner.  My friend, my friend, I was on the road. 
[02:38:30]  You know, I was doing comedy for, like, two years.  I was doing it, and I came home.  He goes, I'll get you high.  You know, we'll go out and party.  So he bought an eighth of Coke, right?  Okay, let me get this exactly right.  An eighth was three and a half grams.  So he said, I'll sell a gram.  Oh, boy.  He said that to get, he said, I'll sell two and a half grams to get my money back.  It was $2.50, so, and then I'll give, we'll party with a gram.  So we party with a gram.  We're at my friend's house.  So he has the other two and a half grams, cutting half gram, five packages.  Five, you know.  This is math.  I'm already lost. 
[02:39:00]  I know, I know.  Well, whatever, he's on a train heading north.  This is funny.  He had five half grams.  Okay.  And he fell asleep, and I knew where he hit him.  Oh, you scumbag.  So, like, I would take a half a gram, and I would cook it with the ammonia.  There was a way to cook it with the ammonia.  I'd pour the ammonia out and say, I'm not going to do this again.  Steal any more from him, right?  So, time goes by.  I would steal another half a gram, drive to the store, and buy ammonia again, right?  I made four shifts to the store for four different bottles of ammonia, going, I have a cleaning 
[02:39:30]  bridge.  I have a cleaning service, right?  Yeah, cleaning out your friend of his Coke.  So, I smoked all his Coke.  I'm downstairs at my friend's house, drinking a tall glass of vodka straight, and I hear  upstairs, someone yell, fuck.  I go, oh.  Oh, he knows.  Of course.  So, he walks out, I go, I sold it on credit for you.  Sold it on credit.  Look, I did you a favor.  I sold it and didn't get the money. 
[02:40:00]  Guy's doing you a favor.  What a creep.  Yeah, he was doing a comedy show, and he's going to be on Sunday, I'm going to get the  money.  But let me, you know, all these stories, and I don't usually tell these stories because  they're worth, I'm coming up on 19 years clean.  So, I don't forget.  I'd like to applaud every time.  That's our boy.  No, I'm not, here's the thing.  I don't want people to think I, you know, I condone drug use.  Of course not.  Of course not.  You've seen the horrors of it.  You got lucky that you made it out of there.  Yeah, I mean, it's not an easy drug, you know, to kill.  I think you should be dead. 
[02:40:30]  I can't really say it, but.  Last time I did COVID in the 80s.  We took some unbelievable chances there.  It's like in the 80s.  80, 86, I guess, 87.  Really?  Last time I did it.  Oh.  It was, you know, everyone was doing it back then.  We didn't know it was unsafe.  Yeah, they do it to be cool.  Be a part of the in-group.  That's right.  Be part of the members only.  Have your little brown vial with the spoon on the lid.  Sure.  The lesson here is that you've seen the good part of life, and you've seen the  worser side of it.  The worser.  Right.  The worser side. 
[02:41:00]  You know, I mean, you know, stories.  I'm just saying, if you learn anything from these stories, is you can get my DVD at  richfoss.com.  Oh, boy.  That's right.  The inspirational DVD.  If your kids are doing drugs, richfoss.com.  Better than Coke.  You could cut your Coke on it.  Yeah, yeah.  It has a hard top on it to make it a little bit easier.  It's all black, so you wouldn't lose any.  You could see your whole pile of clothes.  It comes with a rolled-up dollar actually pushed into the side.  You could cut it up with the side of the actual DVD.  It's a whole Coke-snorting kit. 
[02:41:30]  That's a great idea.  The dollar rolled up.  What a great marketing thing.  That would be hilarious.  If I was a recovering addict, I would steal that and make a lot of money.  Wow, Voss.  Thanks for the radio, man.  Yeah, that was good.  I love old addict stories.  We're hanging with Voss and John Heffron.  John Heffron's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long, starting tonight through Sunday.  You could call Caroline's at 212-757-4100 for tickets.  But limited shows.  You're not doing all shows, right?  Because of the festival, so...  Yeah, you've got to just call Caroline's and find the schedule. 
[02:42:00]  I know tonight it's at, what, 11 o'clock?  Yeah, it's a later show.  Very funny, John Heffron.  Can I fly in Chicago next week?  No.  You really can't.  Did I tell a story, though, about me and my friend?  My friend worked at this funeral parlor, and we would sit on, like, we would smoke pot  with the dead bodies, and then go, you want some?  And then punch him in the head, and go, you can't have any, you're dead.  That's one of my bits.  I know.  I know.  They photoshopped you.  Where can they find this? 
[02:42:30]  On opianthony.com?  That's funny.  A whack bag?  All right, where can they find this?  Cage photoshopped.  The photoshopped threads and whack bags.  And looking at it, Voss just opened his mouth and drooled.  Nice to see 19 years clean has helped.  He fucking drooled.  He just drooled.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I don't know.  Hey, did you feel bad for attacking Dee Wallace and her son in that car?  Thank him.  Thank him.  Come on.  Oh, God. 
[02:43:00]  Who is that?  That's you.  That's you with dreadlocks.  I don't know where they got that picture.  They've been using it a lot on Photoshop things.  I think that's a picture of me, you, and Chappelle, actually.  We took it to the cellar years ago, and your eyes are half closed, and your mouth is open in a horrible pose.  Really bad.  I don't know how horrible those teeth look.  They had to color it out.  I never had a yellow tooth.  It's a black and white picture.  Yeah, they did. 
[02:43:30]  They colored in one of your teeth.  Oh.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Right-o.  And we'll continue.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yo, I'll take F to you to all three of you, fucking idiots.  If you don't think the American government, you know, attacked us on 9-11, you're a fucking moron.  Not only that, Norton, you sound like fucking Bill O'Reilly.  Let the fucking guy speak, you piece of shit.  You fat-fitting little thin-lick faggot.  Yeah, there's a big fuck you to Ashley. 
[02:44:00]  I make you ought to jump in my semi, and I'll make you my trucker bitch.  I want to give a big fuck you to Comcast, fucking lower rates, lower pay, fucking hard to work.  Fuck you, Comcast, you suck my fucking dick.  Yeah, I want to leave a big fuck you to Ben Stegen for not working in that Don King audio off of Fox News.  Yeah, that was some funny fucking shit, fellas.  You know, you ought to really use that fuck, you know, unless you're going to use it on a, you know, tomorrow show, then, you know, fuck me.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU line 1-866-FU line 1-866-FU line 1. 
[02:44:30]  Well, fuck you very much.  So, it's great to be back in Texas, where the speed limit on the interstate is 70 miles an hour.  Unless you're in an 18-wheeler, then it's 65 miles an hour.  Unless it's at night, then it's 60 miles an hour.  Unless you're in a car pulling a big trailer, then it's 55 miles an hour. 
[02:45:00]  And they do this, of course, because having everybody drive the same speed on the same road just doesn't make sense.  I'm surprised they make them drive the same direction.  How about you? 
[02:45:30]  I couldn't spell when I was a little kid.  I couldn't spell.  So, my parents got all concerned.  So, they went down to the toy store.  They bought me a little red box called Speak and Spell.  You remember that? Speak and Spell?  They shouldn't have called it Speak and Spell.  But they should have called it Speak Like the Devil.  Remember the voice?  A-E-I-N-O-Y-O  What was that?  That thing was evil. 
[02:46:00]  A-I-L-Admin.  That thing would wake me in the middle of the night, like two in the morning.  Play with me.  Get up.  I want to spell right now.  I'm 8 years old, I spell great, I talk like a freak  I'm like, mom, something is wrong  Something is W-R-L-N-G  Mmmmm 
[02:46:30]  Mmmmm  The Technophile  Hi, I'm Laszlo  When it comes to sending text messages on your phone  You can either punch it out on the number pad  Or some phones have a miniature keyboard  But that makes it way larger than it needs to be  Motorola has a new phone coming out that solved the text entry issue  The A668 uses text input technology called finger writing recognition

[02:49:30]  Your description of all the fun that you were having  Making people want to do coke again  Someone says  Ask Voss what year did Chevy come out with the Z100  I was thinking you meant Z28 Camaro  I think you said the Z100  You did  What was it?  Did I?  I don't know  You said you were traveling in the Z100  I don't know  But what are words  It's a car that has  It's just a word  It's just a word  We knew what he was talking about  Of course  Next time I come in  I'll tell you some gambling stories 
[02:50:00]  But you're still a gambler, aren't you?  No, I got  You stopped doing that?  Yeah, but only recently  You called that 800 number two?  A year and a half  But I did have a slip one night  So I got like three months again  Three months clean  That's still great, man  And I just  I walked  Like an idiot at the casino  I was performing at  I walked downstairs  And I could have not gambled  If I would have called  Like Norton or somebody  You know  But I said I'm gambling  I knew it was building up  Oh boy  The week before me and Bonnie  Were in Vegas 
[02:50:30]  And I'm watching her play Slots  And I'm sitting next to her  Right?  And she's playing  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding  I don't even play Slots  The sound of the casino  Slots is like  You know  It's like  Craps  You gotta shoot craps  You know  You gotta shoot craps  If you're gonna gamble  Shoot craps  So I was working somewhere  At some casino  I don't know  Because I do a lot of casino  I'm a big guy  And I just walked down  From my room  It was in my head  I said  I'm gonna  I walked down  I took a thousand dollars  Put it on a table  And I lost it 
[02:51:00]  And I yell at people  When I'm shooting craps  I'll yell you stink  Or I'll smash the table  One time I went  Ah  Fucking threw my hands up  And knocked a waitress's  Whole tray in the air  So  And I get thrown out  You know  And stuff  And  I just lost all  The thousand like that  Walked to my room  And said  Well I'm done again  But it made me realize  How easy it is  To pick up an addiction  I was gonna ask you too  Shit  Something you just said  About going down  To get the money  Man  It's just  It's horrible 
[02:51:30]  Well let's go to the phones  People want to talk to John Heffron  You just have an addictive personality  Don't you  I know  John Heffron playing  Caroline's all weekend long  Tonight at 11 o'clock  Let's  Did that work?  Alright  Pete what's going on?  B-b-b-b-b-boy  What's up  Pete  Good morning boys  I gotta tell you  I'm a little disappointed  You're not riding  Your old buddy  Jay Moore  As much as I thought  You would be  Who you talking to  B or Heffron?  This guy used to be  In studio with you  Every day  Who you talking to 
[02:52:00]  Opie and Anthony  Or John  Who you talking to  Ben Sparks?  I'm talking to all you guys  Who you assholes  Oh everybody  Oh that Jay  He's a bum  Yeah I know  I don't know  I don't know if we're going to ride him  Or just rib him  Yeah  Well at that end  I want to know  I heard that he was a big asshole  Behind the scenes there  At Last Comic  How was Jay Moore  Behind the scenes  At Last Comic standing guys?  Behind the scenes  He never talked to me  That much  No?  I don't think he  You know  He has a business  Like you know  Like you work with somebody  You don't really give a shit 
[02:52:30]  About either way  I think that's kind of  How he treated me  He really didn't care about me  So he didn't talk  I mean he was friends with Rich  He talked to you guys more  But I've known how long  18 years  Yeah  15, 18 years  So it's different  You smoked crack with the guy  I mean  No I showed him my crack  At the golf course  I did  I pulled my pants down  He was walking up  I pulled my pants down  I just spread my  So there's no problems  Behind the scenes really?  Not with me and him  I mean you know  What problems might you have heard about?  Well I don't  What I heard about?  Yeah  I don't know  I didn't hear really  Didn't Gary like 
[02:53:00]  Try to punch him or something?  Is that what happened?  No he didn't punch him  He threw him against the wall  Goleman did yeah  Yeah Gary Goleman did  He actually threw him against the wall?  Yeah they were  They were wrestling  And then  Then Gary just  Hulked out  For no apparent reason  And slammed him against the wall  And Jay kind of had to look on his face  Like  Whoa  What's this for?  Because they were kind of just  Like horse playing on  And then  Gary slammed him against the wall again  And started  You know  Started going  A few more  A few  And started walking away  And flipped him off  Nobody tried breaking it up 
[02:53:30]  Well that would have been  See Gary's a tough dude  Yeah people forget  That he's kind of put together nice  But he's still like  6'6  You know  200 some pounds  And snaps  Like that dude like snaps  I guess  If he was just you know  Wrestling around  Yeah I don't know  There had to have been  Something that happened  Before that  We didn't see  But it happened on stage  Well I didn't really  Bring  You know  Tell the whole story  Remember Rich Voss  Didn't tell that story  But  The story I told  Was in the Enquirer  Actually  That's right  But Jay's a tough guy too  Yeah  People don't know  Jay was a tough guy 
[02:54:00]  Yeah  That was a good fight  You know  He's not a wrestle  Yeah I had a fight  Fight club with Jay  In the studio  When we were at NEW  And he kicked my ass  Really  Oh totally  Yeah he's a tough guy  How about  How about Poe against Jay  No forget  Poe would rip him apart  Poe would rip apart  Yeah  Yeah if you're not  Anyone  How about Poe and Norris  So  Norris knows that  That would be a good fight  Norris is  Extremely powerful  And an absolute sociopath  I know  Norris is a dangerous guy  I'll tell you  He would have to  Poe would have to  Disable Norris immediately 
[02:54:30]  Because that guy's  Like a bulldog  And he's a squat  Like Jeff  Is like  What is he  Five  Seven  Five  Nine  Maybe  But a powerful dude  The center of gravity  Is like  Three inches off the ground  He should be spinning  In a Bugs Bunny cartoon  Yeah exactly  He's built like a gorilla  Oh he really is  A powerful psychopath  I would actually  I would beg Norris  Not to hurt me  I would go  Look please  I'm sorry for whatever I said  Norris  One day  He wanted to demonstrate  And this is why  I don't do the  Fucking demonstration  Thing with people 
[02:55:00]  He wanted to demonstrate  A hold  He put on some guy  Outside of Caroline's  One night  So he goes  Anthony come here  Is that the hold  He has tattooed on his body  Yeah I think so  One of the holes  He has holes  Tattooed the holes  How crazy do you have to be  On his body  So he grabs me  By the neck  Puts my throat  In the crook of his elbow  And gives a little squeeze  And says how he made  The guy pass out  You're done  I was going on vacation  The next day  For two weeks  Going down to Florida  For two weeks 
[02:55:30]  I was like  I couldn't swallow right  It ruined my fucking vacation  I couldn't swallow right  I couldn't breathe right  The guy screwed me up  Because he doesn't know  His own strength  He's like  I think I heard her  Yeah  Lenny was just petting you  In the eye  Lenny was petting me  George is my friend  I would love him  And squeeze him back  George  Spank him when he's bad  I was  We were working together  At Rascals  Are you talking about  Another comic  I don't know who you're talking about  Yeah  He's a comedian  I don't know 
[02:56:00]  What does he take  Jiu-jitsu or  I don't even know  He's not a comic  Oh he's a good stand up  Yeah  Drives Otto and George around  He's just playing to fame  He does impressions  He turns around  To get ready  And the audience runs out  Make a left  You fucking animal  You ever see the  Mini Wheats commercial  He was one of those guys  Oh yeah  The Mini Wheats voices  He's not a pesky voice  He's a nice guy  I mean  But we were at Rascals  Stop trying to weasel  Out of your trash  He's a nice guy  I know  Like you just trashed him  And said he stinks  But I did say you were nice  I didn't say he stinks  I said he does impressions 
[02:56:30]  Okay  His impression stinks  He doesn't  You know  He sets them up good  But no  Who the hell wants to see  You know  Impressions of Jimmy Stort  Anyhow  I do Jimmy Stort  Just by talking  So we were at Rascals  Go a little  Something like this  We were at Rascals  And he was on stage  He middled  And I had  And he had a good set  He had a good set  But he kept  As I was on stage  Kept walking back and forth  And I finally stopped  I go look  How much can you milk  Out of your show  And we start arguing 
[02:57:00]  With each other  Oh boy  And they had to hold him back  He wanted to come out  Because in front of the stage  I verbally  Tore my pieces  And then he  They had  He would have killed  He is so strong  Of course he would have  He's so strong  And he's so built  You know  And I learned a lesson  To stop with your stories  When you have good drug ones  That was actually not a bad story  Because I mean  It's just  You know  We're talking about the guy  But him and this guy  I'll save you boss  Let's go to Jim in PA  Hi Jim in Pennsylvania  Jimmy  Good afternoon gentlemen 
[02:57:30]  Hey  Good afternoon  As far as ONA concerns  Listen  Who's this guy  You got pretending to be boss  He can't be boss  Because boss isn't funny  This guy's funny  Boss is very funny  Now we all know  Boss is funny  He's a mess  But he's funny  Boss is a disaster  As a human being  And he's a bad friend  And he coughs  When he smells cat shit  While you're jerking off  On a bed with a girl  He's an awful man  He gets awful tickets  For roasts  Oh that's  Thank you by the way  For those fucking seats  In the blimp  Have we talked to you  Live on the air since then  Oh I guess on the phone  Yeah on the phone 
[02:58:00]  You brought it up  I got you balcony seats  That was wonderful  Oswald was closer to Kennedy  Than we were  To the stupid roast  Listen  Listen  This jackass right here  I'm doing a photo shoot  On stage before  And he comes running  On his stage  Take a picture with me  And Donald  Right in my photo shoot  But I  Was I a team player  Did I take it  You are the greatest  The only pictures  You could take  We needed a telephoto lens  From where we were sitting  To recognize who the fuck  These people were  It was wonderful  When we walked up the stairs 
[02:58:30]  We were huffing and puffing  We take our seat  I expected the whole place  To spin with a beautiful  View of the city  We were like  What the hell is this  We were the only ones  Up there  Us and your parents  Behind a TV monitor  It was the last  Yeah like we weren't  Up high enough  Where we couldn't see anything  Then they shoved this  Big screen monitor  In front of us  So all the people  That had the bad seats  Down below  Could look behind them  And see the screen  And he's trying  To make it better  Well that's where  You want to be  Because no it's not 
[02:59:00]  You don't want to be  With the celebrities  Right next to you  Charles Grodin  And Judge Judy  You don't want to  Sit with them  Judge Judy  I'm just saying  That's a nice little table  Charles Grodin  Charles Grodin  In reference  He's funny  Charles Grodin  Is a brilliantly funny guy  I really  I almost walked off  The dais  When that first guy  Went up  Stewie Stone  He killed  I've never seen  Anybody on a roast  Kill like this guy  Killed  Then Susie Esma  Went up and killed  And I'm looking at  My horrible little  Fucking ten jokes 
[02:59:30]  Going  I gotta get out of here  I was in a panic  Who got quoted  In the paper though  I got quoted  In four papers  The star  See  Yeah and so  But I started off slow  What was the Donald Trump  Joke they quoted  I go  The reason his name's  On all his buildings  So the banks  Know which ones  To take back  That's a good one  They quoted that one  And the one  The danger bill one  Right the Rodney one  Was really funny  We had to do it  Because people  Weren't at the  They asked Rodney  When they were  Putting a roast together  They asked Rodney  If he wanted to do it  Rodney if he wanted to do it  He said I'd rather be dead 
[03:00:00]  That's very funny  I was going to use that  That wouldn't have worked  If he didn't die  I was going to use that  With Arafat  At your show  On Saturday  Well there goes that idea  You guys asked Arafat  If he wanted to do the show  But I'll still do it  Because you know  You guys want to talk  About Liza Minnelli  Sure  I was hoping to  What a twisted story  She's um  She's  Well she was married  To the gay guy  And it turns out  During this  Well you know  During the marriage  She wasn't getting 
[03:00:30]  Having sex  With him  But she was apparently  Having sex  With her bodyguard  Forcing the bodyguard  To have sex  How else would  Anyone have sex with  Liza Minnelli's bodyguard  Sounds as though  He needed protection  From her  Charging that  The aging songbird  Forced him to have sex  With her  And regularly beat him  Did she  The bodyguard  Did she make Linderman  Have sex with her  Linderman  Oh my bodyguard  Very good  Very nice  And now  The bodyguard  Is now suing  For a hundred million dollars 
[03:01:00]  Anthony  A hundred million  For having to have sex  With Liza  Yeah  How do you force him  To have sex  I don't know  It says  He was forced to engage  In sexual relations  With Minnelli  What else  Yeah that's about it  I guess  I like that he says  He has physical evidence  Of the sex  That he had  With Liza  Is this Liza  In the background  Oh she stinks  Oh  Chickling  Chickling the ivories  I saw her  On the Tony Dancer show  First episode 
[03:01:30]  She came out  Her upper body  Looked like the Tin Man  Oh this is  I didn't think  This was Liza  I thought this was  Linda Marola  I hate when I don't get  The Jimmy Norton references  I feel so ignorant  Is that Frankie Pace  I'd have sex  With him for a hundred million bucks  For a hundred million  Of course  Yeah  I feel like a bunch of times  I don't know how you're forced  So the first time  We'll be raped 
[03:02:00]  Ross would do it for a vile  Yeah  Second time  It's kind of hard I think  Maybe he was asking for it  Maybe he was dressed  Provocatively  I don't  The bodyguard outfit  I don't think it's like  A rape thing  I find it hard to believe  He was worried  That he was going to  Lose his job  Right  It was a nice job  You know you're working  For Liza Minnelli  You're a bodyguard  Nobody cares  To get it up though  Like to you know  Work with the celebrities  And all of a sudden  She you know  Tells him look  I think that's sex with me  I think that's a great  Ploy in court though  You could say  Look he's still got it up  He must have had  Some kind of attraction there 
[03:02:30]  Must have wanted something  I guess though  If women can kind of  Sue guys for  You know that  Women who actually  Sleep with guys  Several times  And then afterwards goes  He made me  Or I didn't want to  Then yeah  I'm glad I'm so bad in bed  I never get to sleep  With him several times  Yeah  I would have liked that  If you didn't lose faith  Halfway through  All right  Damn it  That was fun  That's why I'm so bad  Ah gee whiz  You know that  I better finish it now  I'm already  Halfway through the sentence  When you're with  This group of people  It's very hard  To have confidence  If you're blurting  That line up  Because you're like 
[03:03:00]  I think it's good  But it could really bomb  And then I'll have to  Sit here and look  At these silent faces  Locking me  How awful was it before  When I did my Saturn joke  And I actually went  Blah blah blah  And got maybe  A minus one  And politely  Everyone ignored it  That was not only  An awful bomb  But I made noises  And bombed  The worst is when you're  Bombing  Opio will just pick up  Something and start reading it  Like you're not even here  Oh like it never happened  Now here's what the worst  I get uncomfortable  Here's the worst opi thing  So they're saying 
[03:03:30]  You gotta get out of here  We gotta get you out of here  Oh  That's torture  Oh he trashes you  And he gives you  A little wink  Oh that stinks  Don't wink at me  Lost confidence  You can't have it  I know  It's like being  A battered woman in here  That really was  A Vicky LaMotta delivery  I didn't promise  Not to get you excited  You guys  We got an old friend  On the phone here  An old friend  An old friend  He did our last  I kind of like 
[03:04:00]  The lounge music  Playing in the background  It was kind of nice  We have an old friend  Dropping in  It relaxed everybody  It did  Oh is Anthony Michael Hall  Oh wow  That's true  Good reference  Wow  I forgot about that  Anthony Michael Hall  Was supposed to be a guest  On our last show  That we had  We didn't know  It was going to be  Our last show  It was the day after  The Sex for Sam debacle  And Anthony Michael Hall  Was supposed to drop in  And he didn't want  Anything to do with us  Because he started  Reading the newspapers  That morning  Good for him  I better move  Not to  I called in  I was the last call  I went out  And bought a Mercedes  Thinking I was doing  That O&A tour 
[03:04:30]  The O&A tour  We were going to put together  How do you think I felt  Moving into New York  Because Oprah's like  Dude things are going great  Move in  Stupid me  I'm paying $300 a month  In Jersey  With Florentine  And his girlfriend  And I'm like  Yeah this is fine  Moving to New York  It's going to be great  Yeah the O&A tour  Of my kitchen and living room  For two years  That was the tour  Hey he was a friend  To the end  We got to say hi  To Brian Regan man  Hey Brian  Hey  What's going on  There he is  How you guys doing 
[03:05:00]  Hi Brian  Much better now  Brian  I just  I was just interviewing  A new bodyguard  Yesterday  Oh yeah  The other one  Wouldn't get frisky  With you  Yeah he didn't want to  You know  Do what I think  Bodyguards should do  Wow I can't believe  You're back on our show  This is  Over two years  Man I appreciate you guys  Having me back on  Congratulations  On the 
[03:05:30]  Appreciate it guys  On the new XM thing  Man that's great  Yeah we're pretty psyched  About it  You were there  You were there  For the last show  Remember how uncomfortable  It was  Remember it was  The biggest story  In radio ever  And we couldn't  Talk about it  And you were  Sitting there with us  Yeah management  Had dropped off notes  And stuff to us  And they kept putting  Signs up against the windows  Saying you are not  Allowed to talk about  What happened yesterday  At all  And to this day  I kicked myself  That we didn't say  A lot of things  On that last show  But we were thinking  At the time  Well maybe they're  Going to try to 
[03:06:00]  Save our jobs here  So maybe we should  Listen to somebody  For one  Oh I know  That's you know  It's that hope  That stupid hope  That you think  I bet we get through  This one  If we just listen  To them  If we just listen  To the orders  And walk  And be nice  We will get through  This  Drink the kool-aid  No we just get  On the boxcar  They take us  To the camp  And we will get through  With just that faith  And hope  That everything's  Going to be okay  Yeah I remember  I was just being fired  Just as bad  As the holocaust 
[03:06:30]  Yeah it's an  Accurate comparison  I mean you guys  Do something like that  And are justifiably  Let go  And compared to  Six million people  Who are slaughtered  Like sheep  Just for existing  Yeah  Brian you're not  Supposed to laugh  At that type of humor  Brian where are you  I'm here in  Las Vegas  Oh cool  You live there  Full time now right  Yeah I live here  Full time  It's a full time thing  Put down a bet  For Voss  No  Yeah what do you want  No  Well I want a career  The other night on stage  My audience is so awful 
[03:07:00]  I said this  How awful are they  No I just said  I just said  I just  Brian Regan has the best audiences  That come to see him  They're just the best crowds  Because he's really funny  Yeah he's  Yeah obviously  I bet Brian is so happy  We have been off the air  For two years though  No  Because his crowd  Was starting to get a little  You know  Yelling out  The big yellow ones  It's the sun  Yeah  Like I saw you getting  A little cranky  At a couple of shows  Because our audience  Was being a bit rambunctious  Yeah they're yelling 
[03:07:30]  Out the punchlines  Regan has the biggest  Actually mentioning it  On the air  Every time I was on  With you guys  Alright folks  Please  Go see them  Just listen to them  Yeah  You don't have to be  Yelling constantly  Yeah Brian's like  The always nice guy too  He'd just be like  Yeah I understand  I appreciate your show  And everything  But you know  Maybe you shouldn't  Yell out that stuff  You know  And it's all nice  And everything  He wants to just go  Dude  Shut the fuck up  I'm doing jokes up here  But hey  I understand the guy  You know  He's appreciating the show 
[03:08:00]  And that's a good thing  And then the audience  Would like  Yell out a joke  And then Brian  Because he's the nice guy  Would do that joke  Even though he didn't  Want to do that joke  Didn't want to do it  That new material  Yeah throws him off  Of what he was doing  Alright I'll do  The cup of dirt thing again  I'll do the cup of dirt  No you didn't want to do it  But the thing with Brian's act  Is you can literally hear it  So many times  You don't get sick  We're managed by the same people  And every time I call  My managers  He's on the hold  Like when you call  Yeah  There's this guy  Who sings in Vegas 
[03:08:30]  And then there's Brian  And then I always get bummed  When my manager Peter  Clicks over to me  I'm like  Oh he wasn't done  With the fishing story  I'm bummed  I hear it probably  Like eight or nine times a day  And that's the difference  Your management  Doesn't put Brian on hold  Yeah that's what that's  The only problem with Regan  Is though he's filthy  And that's the problem  It's like  It's great  It's offensive stuff  What's that blue humor  It's the biggest  It's the most varied audience  I've ever  Me and Voss  Worked with Regan  One time in Caroline  And it's like  It's bikers 
[03:09:00]  And it's like  Seventy year old women  And they all like it  I've never seen any comic  Have like a  More varied audience  How do you live in Vegas  Now though Brian  The weirdest audience  I ever saw  Was I was working  In San Diego  At the Improv  For like two weeks  But on the Monday  That I was off  They had  Tiny Tim  Tiny Tim  Was like  You know  Coming in to do his  His thing  His little whatever  That is  It was  You know  His ukulele show  Right  But everyone deserves 
[03:09:30]  To make a living  Of course  Sure  Absolutely  So I had to go over  And check him out  You know  And he was like  The nicest guy off stage  But the group of people  That came in  To see Tiny Tim  Was like the  The oddest assemblage  Of human beings  I had ever seen  You know  It was like  Odd body shapes  You know  Like no two hair colors  Were the same  And everyone was like  Limping in some way  It was like  So bizarre man  But he was like 
[03:10:00]  He was like  A pretty decent guy  You know  He remembered my name  He kept introducing me  To everybody  This is Mr. Regan  Mr. Regan  I'm like  Wow  Why is he introducing me  To all these people  You know  Nice enough guy though  Yeah  Nice enough  I was wondering  How you live in Sin City  You know  Although he probably  Calls it  Naughty City now  Just not quite as bad  It's Naughty City  It's been raining here  Like the last few  You know  The last couple weeks  When we moved out here  Last year  They had a rainstorm 
[03:10:30]  Like  Like I couldn't believe  I mean  It was like  Hail hitting the house  You know  Like  Hail was like  Banging up against  All the windows  My wife was in the other room  And she hears like  This  Click click click  Click click  And she told me later  She thought  That I was banging out  An angry email  And there was so much  Like rain  That our flooded got  Our basement got flooded out  And on the news that night  They were calling it  A hundred year storm  They said  That the weather 
[03:11:00]  Only converges that way  Like once every hundred years  Where you would get  That kind of intense rain  With that kind of flooding  And I swear  The weatherman  Like the very next moment  Said  The last  The last time  The Las Vegas Valley  Had a storm  This intense  Was in the year  Nineteen  Ninety  Eight  I'm like  I don't know  What the definition  Of a hundred year storm is  But apparently  They have one  About every six years  Out here  I was there for that one  The whole strip flooding

[03:23:30]  You gotta do it  You better hurry up  It's gone  Alright  This is what it is for face value  John  John into the microphone  Look at the look on John's face  What do you think  Get some more he says  What do you think  You know what it smells like  I dated a girl who was a bulimic  Who threw up  You know how when your body starts to rot  From the inside  That's what that smells like 
[03:24:00]  I did see it  It was revulsion that that came from a human being  Right  Hefron was taken back  Like all comedic instincts went away  It was like an animal  That smell should not come from a living human being  Isn't that unbelievable  Isn't that unbelievable though  John  That's  We have that on film  We'll put it up  Is that  We'll put that up on  Poundrymusic.com  Is there a scratch and sniff on your DVD  Wait let me see  Let me see  He wiped it on his DVD  That's what's behind your ear 
[03:24:30]  I know  He wiped it on his DVD  And it actually made the DVD smell better  Now I won't get it for a couple days  Like a week  That's unbelievable  Get away from me  But you don't smell like  I stood around you  You don't have that smell about you  No not at all  Anthony is so skewed out  I love it  There  Yeah  So I waited  I was coming in  So I let it build up a little 
[03:25:00]  I'm just going to wash your hands  Put some of that stuff  Is that from the drugs maybe  Put some of that stuff on your hands  No  No  What is it from boss  That's not disinfectant  Yeah it is  It will take it off his hands  Boss what is it from again  He doesn't spray it into his hand  So his finger doesn't touch the top of it  It's from what  He'll explain  Smell it  It's hands free soap  Like it's hands free soap  No one wants to get near his hands now  Alright boss  What is it again  What is that  Can you shoot that stuff up my nose  Boss  Get on mic  What is that  What is what  It's hand free soap 
[03:25:30]  No no  Hands free soap  Hands free soap  No boss  The ear thing  What is it  It's I think from  When I was young  Not young  In high school  Something I had a cyst  And the cyst was  You know  And then I guess  It just  What was in it  Shit  What  I didn't enjoy it  Shit  At least I didn't just  Wash my hands with something  That does require water  Stupid  I didn't read  Oh so what  Because I didn't read the label  Oh I'm using it too  He tricked me with a bra  He's tricked too 
[03:26:00]  I'm like yeah  Yeah  Would they have a water  Oh no  Does it work  It wasn't that bad today though  No that was bad  We got some good reactions today  Did you see his face  Yeah John Hepburn's face was great  Yeah because I didn't know  Yeah because I thought maybe  It was a joke you guys played  And you stick your finger in my face  Or something like that  No no no  And then  So then when I actually smelled that  That bad  His belly button's pretty bad too  Not as bad as that  I have to have a load  My belly button the night before  And then fall asleep  You have to have a load  Aww  So  If I arc 
[03:26:30]  When I got Bob belly  Doesn't it usually land on your chin to load  No he talked about this  It hits the back wall  It does have a good range  That would  That would have been  Go ahead  Tell us about your belly button  No I just want that chin line  To sit there  Hurts doesn't it  Hurts  That smells different than like  I've like cut my toenails  And you know  I'm that guy  Like I'll cut it  And then  Or if you scoop it out  You'll sometimes smell it  You know the stuff that gets in the corners of your toes  You smell it when you're by yourself  Just to kind of see  But that's a different smell than that even 
[03:27:00]  Even in toe crud  You know  If he put his hand in a bowl of maggots  They would fucking slither away  I almost said they would ride away  And I'm glad I corrected myself  Yah  Yah  Maggots ride  You saved yourself on that one  How about Vincent D'Onofrio?  Oh yeah  Where's that story?  I don't know  He's cracked  Enough of these Kerry supporters  Passing out  Not being able to handle  That he  Holy Christ  It's so emotional  What a bunch of babies  Yeah 
[03:27:30]  Vincent D'Onofrio  Star of Law and Order  Criminal Intent  But we remember him as Private Pile  Yep  In Full Metal Jacket  When he was all fat  He  He's been getting in fist fights with people  On the set  Of his TV show  And then he passed out  And everyone thought he was faking it  But he insisted  They called 911  They came and took him away  And everybody  Rumor on the set  Is he's cracking  And it's all because  He's upset  That George Bush  Got elected 
[03:28:00]  And he's a big  Kerry supporter  What a bunch of babies  I know  Yeah  Ugh  So he's all upset  And losing his mind  They found him in the bathroom  Sitting on a toilet  With a high powered rifle  In his mouth  Ugh  Yeah I'm a little tired  The whole thing's over  You know something  Deal with it  Bush's president  Whether you wanted him in or not  Now he's just got to deal with it  It's four years  Look he can't get elected again  Yeah  Take that to heart  And I hope the Democrats 
[03:28:30]  Might be able to  If you're a fan of the Democrats  Might be able to come up with somebody  In four years  That actually can win  Like Hillary  Not Hillary Clinton  Oh I hope they run her  Yeah  I hope they run her  I hope so too  Just for the jokes  Because  If the Democrats are stupid enough  In four years  To not come up with a viable candidate  And throw that bitch  In front of everybody  Anyone will win  I think that  I think that  Even though he said no  I think you're going to see  The Republicans running Jeb  I think Jeb Bush might try  Really? 
[03:29:00]  If George can pull this  Four years out  And actually  Do something  Have  He's got half the country  A little more than half  People will never go for a Bush again  You don't think?  Not only because after  I was thinking recently  Like Bush has two terms  Bush senior had one  What's that  Twelve out of twenty years  You've heard President Bush  And by the time  It's like people are going to want  Something different  I would say McCain  What about Giuliani?  Do you think he'll have a run?  Or Giuliani's a VP probably  I think he's got too many skeletons  Giuliani?  I think so  His whole marriage thing 
[03:29:30]  The thing  Do you think people care about that  As much anymore though?  People love bringing it up  In elections  They love  They bring up anything  Look at Kerry  Look I thought Kerry was a complete  Fucking idiot  He had no passion about anything  I didn't know what he even stood for  Because he was always trying to  Combat what Bush was saying about him  The guy didn't stand up  He was a wussy  But  But  He did go to Vietnam  He was in combat  In Vietnam  Now  You look back at the Clinton  Campaign with Bush 
[03:30:00]  They bashed him  For not going to Vietnam  And that was a big issue  With the Republicans  When Clinton was trying to get elected  And then you get a guy  That did go to Vietnam  And they bashed him  For what he did in Vietnam  It makes no sense  Whatever it is  They will pull it out  And fuck you with it  That's what they do in elections  And I think  If Giuliani  I think they'll start  Getting on his marriage  His private life  His health  Oh his prostate  He might not last four years 
[03:30:30]  You know  It's one of those things  I still think Giuliani  Would be a great candidate  Maybe he's just a VP  McCain and Giuliani  Or somebody who's president  And Giuliani  Because Giuliani's  Great with debates  And all that stuff  But he doesn't tolerate shit  From anybody  He ran New York  For all those years  He's a prosecutor  Before that  In New York  So yeah  He's a very solid guy  I'd put him up  Against anybody  Yeah  Yeah absolutely man  I love Rudy  Plus he has a speech  Dependiment  So it's easier  For people like me  You know we're accepted  More than maybe  I could run for something  It's just a word though  He's like the Lenny Bruce 
[03:31:00]  Of slobberers  Jesus boss  He's not gonna pee  Alright yeah  We should take a break  Alright  We're hanging with John Heffron  How do we get more  Out of that Vincent story  Yeah well  I thought we would get more  Out of the Liza Minnelli story  We need more details  Right  We get more details  We'll roll with it  Alright  In a world  Without vibrators  So sweetie  I was thinking  If you'll have sex with me  I'll shave your back hair  Women are tortured  Okay honey  I'll wash and wax your car 
[03:31:30]  In spiked heels  If we could just have sex  Once  Just one time  Just one time  Please  Please  Give it to me  Just any way  Just please  Just give it to me daddy  Please  Please  Women are brought to the brink  Of insanity  Must  Have  Sex  Must  Must find  Penis  Orgasm  Need  So bad  In a world  Without vibrators  Oh a banana  That would be  That would be heaven  Coming soon

[03:34:30]  And store them right  Otherwise all the beautiful properties  That shallots have  To so many different dishes  And recipes  What they add is incredible  You'll lose it  So let's talk about selection  When selecting a shallot  What you wanna do simply  Is make sure it's firm  It has a nice light brown color  All the way around  That is so important  Now when you peel it  Only peel out the outer part  That's it  Don't go too far in  Because a lot of the flavor  Is also in the outer skin  Of the shallots  Now here's another key too  When you bring them home 
[03:35:00]  Don't store them in the refrigerator  Store them on the counter  And unlike onions  Regular yellow onions  The shelf life of shallots  Is very short  You would think they last  For a while  But they don't  And I'm Tony Tantill  Your Fresh Grocer  With your tip of the day  It's the O&A virus  XM202  XM news  Talk  Sports  And information  It's everything  All the time  Seven cents a day  You can get Opie and Anthony  Or feed this little kid

Oh, yeah.  Christmas time.  But this tree was decorated with vaginas.  Little ones, big ones, bushy ones, shaved ones.  And at the top of the tree was the perfect vagina. 
[04:00:30]  She says, was that mine?  He says, no, they were using yours as the tree stand.  How do you turn a fox into a cow?  Marry her.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.
