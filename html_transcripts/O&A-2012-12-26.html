<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with comedian Rich Voss as a guest.  Voss's technological ineptitude was immediately highlighted when he accidentally revealed his Twitter password, "Comic630," on air.  Listeners subsequently hijacked his Twitter, Facebook, and possibly MySpace accounts, changing his profile picture and posting outrageous tweets.  This led to a chaotic segment with Voss frantically trying to regain control while the hosts and callers contributed to the prank.  The segment also featured discussions about Kim Cattrall's age and attractiveness, a forthcoming "cougar" reality show, and listener calls detailing graphic and sexually explicit relationships with significantly older partners. Little Nicky made a late appearance, adding to the chaos.

The show then transitioned to a "Worst of 2012" retrospective, heavily featuring comedian Amy Schumer's sexually explicit anecdotes about sexting, her first sexual experience, a claimed date rape, and a sexual encounter with a cab driver.  Schumer and the hosts discussed sex, dating, the absurdities of sexting, and the correlation between religious backgrounds and sexual experiences.  The retrospective also covered a bar fight between Chris Kyle and Jesse Ventura, with Kyle recounting the altercation stemming from Ventura's criticism of the war in Iraq.  Kyle described punching Ventura after Ventura allegedly insulted fallen SEALs.  The hosts and a caller supported Kyle, while Alex Jones called in, initially questioning the story's veracity before acknowledging potential misinterpretations in Ventura's denial.  The conversation debated the altercation's details and potential consequences, with attempts to arrange a meeting between Kyle and Ventura.  Further discussion of the Ventura/Kyle dispute involved callers Alex and Chris (presumably Chris Kyle) debating the validity of Venturaâ€™s claims, with the hosts attempting to facilitate a resolution.

The show included comedian Jim Brewer's story about a Fourth of July party on the Outer Banks where his group accidentally started three fires due to fireworks.  The story included excessive drinking, interactions with police, and frantic fire containment efforts.  Shaquille O'Neal then appeared in-studio to promote Dove body wash.  The conversation covered O'Neal's business acumen, comedy roasts, views on the NBA and MMA, experiences with fame, and a brief interruption by E-Rock.

The next segment featured interviews with Shaquille O'Neal, Tom Hiddleston, Ricky Gervais (with Joe DeRosa), and Jeff Goldblum.  The O'Neal interview covered his career, childhood, early brushes with the law, basketball stardom, breakdancing, overcoming a stutter, sense of humor, endorsements (Dove and Frosted Flakes), opinions on other players (LeBron James, Michael Jordan), experiences with celebrities (Mike Tyson, Larry Bird), and a humorous vacation anecdote with the hosts. He also discussed his comedic preferences and desire to be an action star.  The Hiddleston segment focused on *The Avengers*, his portrayal of Loki, research for the role, and his accent abilities, including a prank caller. The Gervais segment centered on a recurring joke about the hosts' fascination with Bailey J and Buck Angel, leading to a highly sexually explicit conversation about which Gervais would prefer to have sex with, including explicit descriptions of genitalia. The Goldblum interview covered his early career, his role in *Death Wish* (including the line "Goddamn rich cunt"), acting techniques (Meisner vs. Method), theatre work, his jazz band, and a discussion about a co-star's impressive nipple in a play.  A further segment featuring Goldblum covered his acting approach, influences (Marlon Brando, Peter Sellers), anecdotes about working with various directors and actors (Steven Spielberg, Kevin Spacey), his current play role, his speaking style, impressions of him, and extensive, sexually explicit commentary on Mimi Beardsley's memoir about her alleged affair with John F. Kennedy, including graphic descriptions of their sexual encounters. The segment concluded with a mention of upcoming "Worst of 2012" content featuring Beardsley.

The show concluded with a discussion of the fallout from an interview with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  While the interview went well on air, Abdul-Jabbar's publicist was unhappy with the hosts' line of questioning, which strayed from promoting his book to discussing his basketball career and personal life. This led to a confrontation where the publicist scolded Abdul-Jabbar. The hosts and Kevin Smith discussed the incident, defending their approach and contrasting it with a failed interview with Paris Hilton.  The segment included anecdotes about a childhood toy featuring Lou Alcindor, Abdul-Jabbar's reaction to height questions, a listener's tweet about Paris Hilton, and details from other staff members revealing the publicist's history of disruptive behavior, including previous bans and confrontations with other interviewers (including Covino and Rich). The hosts concluded that the publicist was incompetent and damaging to Abdul-Jabbar's image.

Someone, by the way, Rich, is saying that you do the worst tweets ever.  And by the way, your stupidity...  It goes beyond reason.  Your stupidity just continues to amaze.  Do you know what you did?  Jimmy doesn't even have an idea.  You both were out of the studio, right?

What is your Twitter name?  Rich Voss.  So you can go to www.twitter.com slash Rich Voss.  And you can start following Rich Voss.  Okay, so what was the thing you said earlier?  And what was the thing earlier?  Oh.  What was the comic thing?  I don't know.  Don't say it, because it might be something else. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, it might be?  No, it is something else.  And everyone fucking picked up on it.  And they are hacking the shit out of your Twitter site right now.  Rich Voss gave out his password for his Twitter account.  That comic thing that he gave out earlier was his password.  And lucky most step from Kentucky now owns your Twitter.  And it said, look at the big post he put.  He gave his password.  What an idiot.  Rich.  I didn't even know Twitter had a password.  So some dude from Kentucky now controls your Twitter. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, that's hysterical.  Wow, you are as dumb as they call it.  Kentucky, can you tweet that I'll be at Marco Island next week?  Now he just sees it as some guy that he's hired to.  I'm glad I got somebody running my shit.  Fucking, I was getting tired of these little tweets.  You were getting tired of trying to come up with clever tweets?  Can you put a new, can you put a new, I don't want to lose all the people I'm following.  It's not yours anymore.  Unless this guy does the right thing and gives it back to you.  All the people, you have 3,000 people that follow you.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Opie's got over 30,000.  Oh, really?  The guy on the radio has over 30,000?  And I have.  Hold on, guys.  Hold on.  The guy on the radio right now, he gives out the address.  You give out the password.  Oh, wait.  It's little Nicky.  Let's all look at little Nicky.  He's got a suitcase today.  He's got a suitcase.  He's rolling a suitcase down the hall.  Hi, little Nicky.  All right, back to Rich Voss.  So, Rich, we do that to that guy every day.  We love when little Nicky comes by.  He's late today.  It's usually 820.  I know.  It is a little late.  Rich. 
[00:04:30]  Voss gave out his fucking ass screen as that.  That is typical Voss.  Oh, man.  That's great, Rich.  Wow.  Wait.  This guy's trying to call in.  I think.  Oh, wait.  We might have the guy.  Who's this?  This is Mo Step from Kentucky.  Hey, Mo Step, if it's really you.  How about you tweet, I'm Rich Voss and I suck cocks.  Yeah, go ahead.  Do that.  Do a lie. 
[00:05:00]  I love this.  Can you do that?  You big Jew nose, you're pathetic.  I'm pathetic.  Listen, big nose.  Actually, he has to come up with a tweet.  Say it on our show and do it at the same time.  And that'll prove that you have control of Rich Voss' Twitter account.  Change his picture to something really stupid.  Find something on Google like a big dick.  It already is.  But I didn't page it.  He said, change his picture to something really stupid.  And I said, it already is. 
[00:05:30]  It already is.  See, because it's a picture of you, Rich.  I'm a very good looking man.  Oh, shit.  If I was saying.  Jimmy wants a hug.  No.  Put something awful up there.  No.  Oh, look at that.  Put a picture of us.  See?  No, he wrote, Jimmy wants a hug.  Jimmy wants a hug.  This guy has your account.  Yeah, he's got your account, dude.  That is fantastic.  I'm going to save you, Voss, okay?  Really?  Are you booking improvs?  Did you? 
[00:06:00]  Hey, did you change the password?  I couldn't book you, buddy.  What's that?  Rowan couldn't get you a gig.  Did you change the password?  Yes, I did.  He did right away.  Isn't that stupid?  What's that?  What did he do?  He changed your password.  To what?  He's not telling you.  Yeah, to what?  Let's say it again.  Yeah, let him blurt it out so someone else can take it now.  It looks like a good guy's got your account.  Who's this guy right here?  Yeah, he seems like he's all right.  I'm sure he'll, on hold, he'll give the password to Travis, and he'll give it back to you. 
[00:06:30]  But in the meantime, yeah, write, I'm Rich Voss.  I love cock.  Cut.  Make sure it's cut.  Actually, I'm Rich Voss would just fucking cover that.  I'm Rich Voss.  I love black cock.  Can you put a space between my name?  No, stupid is just like your account name.  Oh, okay.  Listen, don't call me stupid.  Let me, with that accent, we're going to try to build a relationship. 
[00:07:00]  With that accent, he got your password and now runs your fucking Twitter site.  Hey, can you update my MySpace and my Facebook?  Why don't you get that password out over the air?  Those are numbers.  I don't even know those.  This is going to work in your favor.  Now people are going to want to follow you to see what this guy from Kentucky writes for you.  You should let him have it for a few days.  All right.  It's a good promotion for you.  Yeah.  Rich Voss, one word on Twitter to see what Moss, Moss Def.  And it's one S. A lot of people spell it with two. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, I know.  Really?  Yeah.  Leave off the last S for failure.  Yeah, we know what that S is for.  Exactly.  Moss, hold on the line, all right?  That's the password for everything.  For what do you mean for everything?  They said don't even look at his MySpace account.  Oh, no.  Do you use one password for everything?  Don't.  Oh, I go to his MySpace.  This is too good.  And it has to be said on the radio because the feedback is ridiculous.  Rich, read what I wrote. 
[00:08:00]  They pretty much got a hold of your bank accounts at this point.  It's not on any of that stuff.  Read what I wrote to you on this paper silently, out loud.  Yeah.  Can you read that?  Yeah.  It's in the mic.  What do you mean?  Read it out loud?  Yeah.  May 22nd, 23rd.  No, no, what I wrote, what I wrote.  Change your email, password, et cetera.  I wrote that after he gave out that, after that came out, because I know he has the same  password.  He must have the same password for everything. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  No, I don't.  Not for Facebook, I don't think.  Oh, yes, you do.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Wait, Travis.  Travis, what the fuck?  Hey, you know what?  Here's the thing.  They got control of your Facebook, your Twitter, and your MySpace.  Good.  Maybe they'll fucking help me.  I'm getting tired of doing this shit anyhow.  Let's see his Facebook.  Let's see.  Let's see what they did to it.  Quick, change my password.  Oh, no.  I wonder if I'm your friend, Rich.  I don't know.  All right, let's see what happens. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, Rich.  What the fuck?  Let's see.  Rich Moss.  And it's coming up.  Oh, wait.  He didn't do anything.  Hold on.  What?  He didn't do anything yet, so.  Okay.  Who owns Rich's Facebook page now?  Travis does?  Travis nailed it.  Why?  Why?  Because you gave out your password.  Not for Facebook.  It's not the same one for Facebook.  Travis?  Well, MySpace isn't the same.  Well, it's not the same now.  Okay, but MySpace wasn't. 
[00:09:30]  My password wasn't that on MySpace.  Oh, God.  Bobby Kelly things are annoying me.  And they should be, right?  Oh, God.  Yeah, change something, Travis.  Go ahead.  Have some fun with it.  How about the mood?  Yes.  Yes.  Change his mood.  Feeling like a toothy retard.  Jesus, Rich.  What's the matter with you?  Rich is feeling dumb.  I'm not feeling dumb at all.  We didn't pick up on the fact that he was giving out his password. 
[00:10:00]  It was such an obvious password-type word, and none of us picked up on it.  Wow.  What are you calling?  My web guy.  I am a toothy retard.  There it is.  What's that on?  Facebook.  That's your Facebook.  Oh, maybe that's your name.  It's now been hacked.  Yep, it is.  Wow.  Brilliant.  That's fucking Rich.  Why?  We got to do a little back and forth, because Rich Voss' Twitter is now promoting Jimmy Norton. 
[00:10:30]  And it's Scott in Quakertown.  I see Rich Voss is now following Britney Spears.  I always was.  Look at what he's trying to do there.  That last picture.  Oh, was that infuriating.  Oh, my God.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He did it.  What happened?  Rich just got a Facebook password reset confirmation to his Black Mary. 
[00:11:00]  Who owns my Facebook?  Travis?  Oh, he's not a bad guy.  I'm sure he is.  Really?  Not a guy.  Have you ever hung out with him?  Let's say hi to Anonymous.  Anonymous.  Anonymous.  Hey, Bob.  Hello.  It's Jimmy.  Bob.  Wait, wait.  Rich Voss' Twitter picture is now Jim Norton in his underwear.  Oh, what a fucking idiot he is. 
[00:11:30]  He gave out his password on the radio.  That's why we're talking to Anonymous.  Anonymous.  What's up, Anonymous?  Hey, Voss.  Voss ran out of the studio.  He's in a panic mode.  He's on a cell phone.  What do you got, Anonymous?  He just bought 400 hotel tickets for on Priceline.com.  Oh, no.  Was that his Priceline?  Holy shit.  Oh, they're going to kill this guy. 
[00:12:00]  What do you have?  One password for everything.  You can't do that.  You don't have one password ever.  Those Bobby pictures are fucking huge.  Who needs 9,000 by 4,000 resolution?  Oh, my.  It's true.  You're right.  You're right.  He wants people to print him up.  He wants people.  His Twitter picture is hilarious.  It's Jimmy in his underwear pushing his cutout picture. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, is that fantastic, man?  Is he following anybody stupid?  Oh, I mean, himself.  Only he would fucking blurt out his password.  Holy shit.  What an idiot.  That is really, really funny.  Oof.  Goddamn Rich.  He's always good. 
[00:13:00]  He's always fucking good.  He's not following me, by the way.  Motherfucker.  Is he not following?  No, he's following Opie.  He's got to be following me.  He's not following me?  I've got to leave Bob Kelly a message.  Nope, he's not following me.  Well, go fuck yourself then.  Yeah, tell Rich to go fuck himself.  What's the matter?  Oh, boy.  Rich just made a face like, uh-oh.  Things okay, Rich?  You're making some calls?  Yeah.  You couldn't just come in and have a great appearance.  You're in the middle of a great appearance.  Something always has to go wrong with you. 
[00:13:30]  Always.  You're making some phone calls, Rich.  You've got to talk to some people.  I'm sorry that I made a mistake and gave out my password.  How did you do that is beyond me.  I'm amazed.  How did you just blurt your password out?  We didn't pick up on it.  Because who would think somebody would be...  Our audience knows Rich better than we do.  They're like, that idiot just gave out his password.  And we're just sitting here going, that's not your name, stupid. 
[00:14:00]  And everyone else picked up on, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Think of the first guy that typed it in and went, click.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, it is.  Great.  Oh, shit.  But at least I saw my password for my password.  I don't even care about my password.  Someone just bought a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  Paid for it with PayPal.  Rich is leaving the room again with his phone. 
[00:14:30]  His eyes got big when you read that in.  No, I don't even...  Why don't you go make some phone calls?  He put the picture of him with his eyes shut.  They are fucking up all of your pages, dude.  They just put the worst Rich Voss picture ever on his Facebook.  Rich, good news, though.  You gained 200 followers.  I actually took that photo.  People are following you.  Yeah, that's the photo I took originally. 
[00:15:00]  Original Jim photo.  Oh, Sam's running in.  Ah.  No, he's running somewhere else.  What the fuck is he doing?  All right.  Wow, that is...  It's beyond me.  It's beyond me that someone could do that.  There might be a Rich Voss update.  What?  Give it a second.  What?  Oh.  What's Sam?  Why is Sam laughing?  Don't Sam laughing.  Oh, no, boys.  Guess who has his email address? 
[00:15:30]  You.  You.  Yes.  His email is the same one?  Oh, no.  Send out a mass email.  I'm actually glad.  I was worried about his email.  I'm actually glad that...  Yeah, that's some of our idiots.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what I was worried about.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  The stupidity in this guy is just amazing.  It's just...  It's astounding.  I would never give out... 
[00:16:00]  Like, you know your passwords.  Dude, mine...  Just don't ever blurt them out like that.  I couldn't even blurt mine out.  I wouldn't know how to pronounce it.  He actually fucking...  Put?  Fuck you.  Oh, shit.  But I've been working on it.  Oh, that's crazy.  That's funny.  I'm gonna... 
[00:16:30]  Picture of Rich.  Hold on.  It's so utterly bad.  I know.  Jim in Cleveland.  Jim.  Yeah.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  What's your name?  Oh, Jeremy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  I just want to let you know I bought some dryer doors for Voss.  I'll try to dry your door.  Put it out.  It could be one of the top.  That's one of the greatest things that ever happened.  One of the greatest dummy moments.  Voss dummy moments.  And there are so many of them. 
[00:17:00]  Look at him marching down the hall trying to get things done now.  I gotta change my password to Louie Beans.  I love Rich.  He's in a full pack.  Oh, he's pacing the hallway on that phone trying to shut everything down.  Damage control right now.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It's gonna make me laugh for weeks.  Yeah.  Not even for the day.  Weeks.  But that's why you never use, like, the same name and password for everything. 
[00:17:30]  Like, because...  Not because you're gonna blurt it out on an international radio show.  You never do.  I have a bunch of different ones.  Yeah.  Sometimes they get all fucked up.  You ever put in one username and then you can't remember which password you use?  I've forgotten them.  Yeah, I've forgotten them.  And then you gotta run through all of them.  And then you got those...  You got those sites that sometimes only allow you to do it three times before it shuts it  down for a half hour.  Yeah, I know.  And then you got one last try and you're like, is this the one?  That's what happened to my phone recently.  Doink.  And then what happens, then they erase the whole phone. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, you have a set like that?  Really?  It's a corporate phone and all of a sudden they change the password or I don't know.  And by the third time I watched that bar thing go...  Wiping out everything.  Ooh, that sucks.  What a nightmare that was.  His voice twittered a lot recently.  Damn.  All I see is my fat stomach on every one of his tweets.  That is great.  It's the picture of Jimmy's gut. 
[00:18:30]  Please don't mess his thing up.  Just please promote something like that on his twitter.  That makes me so happy.  Oh, it's...  He's getting so many followers, though, because of this.  Yeah.  It might work out for you in the end, Rich.  Ah.  What do we got?  I got him.  I got him.  What do you mean you got him?  I got it.  It's mine now.  It's Dan's now.  Oh, so you got his twitter?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Go to town, Danny.  Rich, you all right?  I've never seen you sweat.  Huh?  You are sweating, my friend. 
[00:19:00]  Hold on, Ken.  We'll get to you in a sec.  Yeah.  You all right there, Rich?  Well, you know...  Comic 630 is me and my birthday.  So you would think, I'm a comic and I put my birthday.  It's easy to remember.  You were born in June?  I know.  No, in February, in February, and I'd like to add on a couple months.  That's exactly where I'll be here.  Wow, I am coming up so short. 
[00:19:30]  Dammit.  That's funny.  But everything is done.  Hold on.  I got to...  Everything is...  You all right now?  What?  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Thank you.  I lost his tweeting my dates.  Thank you.  I don't mind.  Look at your new picture.  Put your glasses on.  Norton in this horrendous underpants.  How do I take this back?  You don't.  You don't.  What do you mean I don't?  It's still mine.  I can still go on it myself. 
[00:20:00]  You can...  Try going on your Twitter right now.  Go update it.  Go ahead.  I can't.  No.  What happened?  They got your password.  So, and then they went...  Oh, took it and switched it to another password?  You're up to like 300, 400 new followers today because of this.  Full paw.  Hey, Reese in Maryland.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  You got to take a look at who he's following on Twitter now.  Who's he following?  Make him follow a bunch of rappers.  Okay.  He's following me.  What is that? 
[00:20:30]  Gay Times?  Gay Times Magazine.  Gay Times Magazine.  Gay Marriage Rights.  Gay Community.  Angry Gay Guy.  Gay Civil Rights.  Adult Gay Sex Porn.  Gay Porn Stud.  Gay Rights Watch.  Gay.com.  Post Gay.  Gay News.  And I'll bet that the fans even added some.  See that.  You know...  Here's the thing. 
[00:21:00]  Let the laughs continue.  Damn it.  I know.  You were doing so well today, Rick.  I knew you would do something to blow it.  You know what?  I didn't blow it.  How did I blow it?  Let people know that I called it today.  How did I blow it?  It's still a good appearance.  What the fuck?  No one's going to remember any of the lines you did today.  It's only about how stupid you are.  Rich, yeah, it's a great appearance.  But let me tell you something.  When you left the room before, Opie turns around and goes, Rich is on fire. 
[00:21:30]  He goes, and he's still going to call me up and ask, how was my appearance and stuff?  He goes, but...  And he told me.  He goes, but watch.  He will fuck something up.  And, oh my.  I didn't even expect it to be this big of a fuck.  His what, Dan?  Rich's Wikipedia has been updated.  Well, I don't do any of that shit.  Of course you don't.  That's not mine.  The last entry says, on May 20th, 2009, Rich gave out his personal password, Comic 630,  on the Opie Anthony radio show, leading to immediate hacking of his Facebook, Twitter, 
[00:22:00]  and email accounts.  Well, not my email.  They can't get to my email.  Oh, they can't?  Well, Sam's got that.  No, he didn't get it quick enough.  That was the call.  I gave it back.  Oh, you gave it back.  He actually did the right thing.  Some of the guys are doing the right thing today.  Yes.  Which is kind of cool, to be honest with you.  See, this Twitter is really all I have.  No, the Kentucky guy, we're giving them a Jim Norton gizmo in a UFC video game.  Yeah, but who's putting all that gay shit on?  Hello. 
[00:22:30]  I love this Twitter account.  What I don't understand about Twitter, anybody can start a Twitter site.  And just take your picture and do it anyhow, without, you know what I mean?  Being the fake Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Well, that's what it is now.  Yeah, so anybody can do this anyhow.  It's not like any big fucking deal.  So, you know, there was, on my, there was, well, son.  It's your name.  What's that?  It's your name, though.  So now if you want to start another one, you have to spell your name differently. 
[00:23:00]  Holy shit, is that funny.  He's got it.  God bless you.  All right, let's go back to Kenny.  Oh, fuck.  That's great.  We got the club's out of Kenny, country radio demo we're trying to get to.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Voss fucking rules, they're saying.  In his stupidity, Voss fucking rules.  Bravo, put in head.  That's Steven S. from Bayshore.  All right.  Rich Voss, look at your new Twitter picture.  Look at that.  Oh, there.  Is it a horse's ass?  Yes.  That is a horse's ass. 
[00:23:30]  Actual horse's ass.  Holy shit, Rich.  Oh, my God.  This is quite a little.  It's just the greatest thing.  A horse's ass picture.  It says Rich Voss and then a plug for Jimmy's show.  Quite a po-fa.  And a bunch of gay followers.  A what?  Po-fa.  What's that word?  He didn't.  He didn't. 
[00:24:00]  How great is it going to be when you hear that clip every time a caller bombs?  Oh, my God.  Hey, where's my fa?  Oh, my God.  What a fucking idiot.  I seem to have lost my fa.  Gentlemen.  I officially have a headache from laughing so hard.  Oh, fuck.  By the way, by the way, they're giving you advice, Rich.  Po-fa.  Mormon Jim is checking in.  He writes, Rich probably changed his password to Comic230. 
[00:24:30]  Please tell me you didn't do that.  You're not that dumb.  No.  Okay.  A po-fa.  A po-fa.  I made a po-fa.  It's great.  Eat it with chopsticks.  You would think after so many years, we just wouldn't be surprised or it wouldn't be funny anymore.  I think it's the depth of the well.  It's so amazing. 
[00:25:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony on Sirius XM.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony on Sirius XM.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony as David Tell makes his way into the studio.  I want to wish Kim Cattrall a very happy birthday today.  Really?  Now, Dave, you might be saying, why are you talking about Kim Cattrall?  We're obsessed. 
[00:25:30]  Well, yeah.  Well, we're obsessed with her lame-ass old cougar on Sex and the City.  Like, they walk around on that show and in the movie like she's hot.  And it's just this old broad talking about.  And they think it's such a freeing thing.  Like, wow, she's so open to her sexuality.  She knows who she is.  No, an old slut isn't attractive. 
[00:26:00]  It's not something guys look at and go, yeah.  She's so empowering.  How old is she?  69.  I love her little quips.  52, actually.  For the 52?  For Kim Cattrall.  But isn't it relative, I mean, compared to the other three?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like George, you know, founding fathers.  Like, who's the hottest?  I like a John Adams.  Yeah.  That's exactly what you're looking at.  Like, all of them are just these not good-looking girls. 
[00:26:30]  The dark-haired one was all right.  She wasn't bad.  She was the one you would go after if they all walked in a bar together and have to fight off the three hyenas.  Well, I love that guy, Evan Handler.  Do you remember him?  Because we all have the same look.  I guess you have it a little bit, too, Jim.  He's like the bald guy on the show.  I never saw it.  You never saw Sex and the City at all?  No.  Jimmy refused.  Then why are you wearing the I Love Sex and the City, the movie, t-shirt? 
[00:27:00]  Awesome attention.  I meant Iron Man.  Yes.  Evan is in Californication now.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  He moved on to Californication, which is a great show with David Duchovny.  I like him because he's the, I guess you could say, the stereotype New York Jewish lawyer guy.  Boy.  Because when I was an actor for a week, I was like, oh, yeah, well, you're up for this point against Evan Handler.  I'm like, oh, well, forget that.  Because he's the guy.  He's the go-to guy.  But he was lucky. 
[00:27:30]  He got to hang out with the dark-haired one.  Oh, okay.  That was his lady.  That was his chick?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  Not like Kim Cattrall, though.  She was out there every night.  And they'd sit at the little diner and drink coffee and talk about how she was plowed the night before.  I guess it's supposed to be hot.  I don't know.  Is that supposed to be hot?  So, did you take that guy home last night?  Did I ever?  I took him and the whole rest of the team.  And you're just looking like, ugh.  You're looking like, that wouldn't happen in real life.  There's a reality show coming out that's based on cougars. 
[00:28:00]  Cougars are the old broads that go out looking for young guys in the bars.  Yeah, just to, you know, someone might be like, what, the Wildcats?  Yeah.  A show about Wildcats?  I want to do a show called I'll Do It.  Just anybody, you know, whatever.  You eat it, you know, whatever.  I'll Do It.  Just every day they just bring something in.  I'll Do It.  And someone does it.  They've got to offer you stuff, though, until you finally go, I'll Do It. 
[00:28:30]  Kind of like that, name that tune or something.  Oh, that's funny, Dave.  Whose feet are those?  That's Kim Cattrall's feet?  Oh, wow.  What is happening there?  What is that?  Edema?  Get those up on O&A Radio.  Look at her bunion.  Wow, what is that?  Well, that is horrid.  Is that horrific?  Is that a cast photo or is that a foot? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, they all look like it.  I'm the big tail.  It's a bad foot.  Yeah.  Oh, you know, and I've talked about it before.  I don't have a foot fetish, but the foot is kind of an important part to the whole package  of a girl.  If they have those big, long, talony ligaments that go in, it's just, no.  It doesn't work.  And it's the last thing you see, really.  Like, you know, it's the last, really.  She's running out the door screaming. 
[00:29:30]  You just see the dirty bottoms of them pitter-pattering to your door.  Get the hell out of there.  What's the reality show all about?  You just started with that.  Yeah, there's going to be cougars, and they're going to compete in bars to see, really, to  see how many younger guys they can pick up.  That should be a hit, huh?  Can't wait for that one.  I think young guys are, isn't that the new thing, that young guys are supposedly into these  older?  Older? 
[00:30:00]  I don't know any guy that is saying, yeah, I want to get my hands on Kim Cattrall.  Could you imagine those feet rubbing against your legs in bed?  Your young legs?  Be horrified.  You're sucking all your life force out of you.  Oh, God.  You're just in a moment of intimacy, and you feel them kind of wrap around your sides, and  just feel bunions, calluses, and toenail fungus.  She looks like she has those feet where those little cartoon things flip her big toenail up 
[00:30:30]  like a car hood, and jump in and start chewing.  They look like, you ever see when they make a plaster cast out of a Bigfoot?  That's what it looks like.  That's what your feet look like.  Nice.  Hey, I got more info on this cougar hunting reality show.  Ladies who want to learn to snag a younger, wait, ladies who want to learn, sorry, to,  wait, this doesn't make sense.  Ladies, just, all right.  Ladies who want to learn how to snag a younger man.  There's an extra two in there.  Okay.  Might want to check out Camp Cougar, a reality series in which mature women pit their boy-bagging 
[00:31:00]  skills against sharp-clawed contestants.  It's rough.  The show hosted by Lisa Gastineau, but not yet definitely scheduled.  We'll take a group of boy-hungry women.  Yuck.  That was it.  Through cougar training and then judged them on their applied skills and then released  them in an urban youth center.  Oh, God.  It's just...  That Gastineau and her daughter, that was the show. 
[00:31:30]  That was pretty wild.  Oh, yeah.  That was.  Yeah, they had a reality show for 10 minutes.  Yeah.  You like that one?  Well, I like that one and the Gotti Boys.  I think that was like a Long Island, you know, like my collection of Long Island stuff.  Yeah.  That was up there.  The trash.  Just looking at the trash.  The Gotti Boys, what happened to them?  Gone.  That's it.  That was it.  You won't see them no more.  The ratings went down and they were...  They whacked the series.  I'll do it.  What about the Hogan family or whatever it's called now?  I think they turned it into Brooke Knows Best or something. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  Did they really?  Change it because there's no family left.  Yeah.  Family imploded.  Just completely imploded.  Wow.  Yeah.  That reality show got the best of them.  Yes.  A little fame for the family.  Now you know why Hulkster was the only one out there.  It's everybody for themselves.  Yeah.  And they're like signing separate deals.  Yeah.  I don't need the family.  Right.  I'm pretty interesting myself.  Is the son still in jail?  Yeah.  But I think he's going to have a reality show when he comes out.  His own.  Of course. 
[00:32:30]  It's called Stitches.  Dumb family.  Stitches and sleeping on my stomach for a week.  Dissolvable stitches.  Yeah.  I like the Cougar.  I think the Cougar show is worth a TiVo.  I think that's, you know.  That's worth a look.  There's definitely going to be a hot tub moment in there, right?  Yeah.  Every show's got a hot tub moment where the Cougar gets in.  Let me slip off my robe.  And she's got this Mrs. Dean Wormer looking broad thing on. 
[00:33:00]  Just looks like too pointy.  She was the ultimate Cougar, like, before there was even the term Cougar.  Yeah, she was hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, she came on, but it wasn't.  I never found her hot.  Like, I was.  I don't know.  When she gets carried to the bed and her boobs are just up.  And she's wearing those dark stockings that you just know smell like mothballs.  I think you can't be a flat-chested Cougar.  No?  No, if you're going to go with the mommy thing, I think you'd want one with big boobies. 
[00:33:30]  And it is such a mother thing.  Like, a young guy with an older woman, it's a mother thing.  You have this infatuation with your mom.  And that's why you're looking for old broads.  Well, are their kids going to show up and judge them?  That would be good.  That would be the best part, yeah.  Yeah.  And I like to date my mom.  I like that on, I think that's on MTV.  That's another word.  It's the Olympics of sad. 
[00:34:00]  And there's something that I personally enjoy doing to a girl that I don't even think I  could muster up the courage to do on a woman that has probably either had kids or just  gravity for that long.  What is it?  Oh, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  There's just a certain act that I like doing.  Does it involve a lobster pin? 
[00:34:30]  Put it this way.  I couldn't whistle at the same time.  We understand.  Whistle a happy tune.  We're just trying to figure out, you know.  But I could do sign language.  We understand that, but are you, you know.  What?  Or.  Oh, oh, you mean.  Do you flip it over and check the oil?  Check the, yeah, right.  You got to, not only do you have to look at your spark plugs, you got to crawl underneath  and check the oil pan sometimes, too. 
[00:35:00]  Down a court.  Look, I'm open to anything.  Believe me.  Hey, that, I'm sorry.  Is that the two-headed turtle of Brooklyn?  Yeah, I guess.  No, it's not.  Oh, what are they doing?  They split them?  Now it's two turtles, yeah.  They've been separated.  Someone stole that turtle.  That would be the great cougar decider, the two-headed turtle.  Whoever's crotch is crawl still.  Yeah, the local news here in New York, they're so bored, they're doing beach week.  I can't believe it.  So every morning, they're at another beach doing just dumb stuff. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, picking up turtles.  The two-headed turtle got ripped off from the pet store.  See, there's, as far as cougars go, that act is just something.  It's something I don't want to be any part of, and for either area, especially for that  other, that special place that only some special people would be privy to, because, wow, there's  got to be a limit to how many miles of stuff has to move through a certain place where you  just cut it off. 
[00:36:00]  Getting old is weird, because the older you get, it seems like bacteria gets more comfortable  to hang out.  What are you watching?  What's going on in that picture, Danny?  Well, I don't know.  God.  It's called grandma porn.  See, there's nothing there.  See, I would watch this as a goof not to get turned on, man.  Who's watching this to get turned on?  I went to a dominatrix one time.  Many years ago, I wanted to get spanked.  I was not really into spanking, and her name was Miss Park.  Miss Park. 
[00:36:30]  She had glasses, and she was probably like 55 years old.  Wow.  She was so awful at it.  Of course.  She was so bad.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that face.  Do you want to see that face doing that to you?  Look, she looks like she's going, ah!  Look how dried out her face is.  How many you-know-whats do you have to, you-know-what, to have a dried-out face?  Like, got to keep it clean over here.  Oh, God.  But she's a grandma.  That's the one who bakes your cookies.  Yeah.  When you hear a scary noise, you sit on her lap, and she tells you something. 
[00:37:00]  I mean, look at that.  You don't want to look and watch her doing that, and then see that red lipstick wicking  up the wrinkles.  It's starting to wick up like little, like Mars canals.  Like a dried riverbed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's making that, ugh, face.  How about the poor kid who sees that on the internet, and he's like, is that my grandma?  Yeah, it's got to be somebody.  But that's not my grandpa's, you know, joystick.  Is that my grandpa's, you-know-what? 
[00:37:30]  Looks so young and turgid.  And black.  Yeah.  And we went to Great Adventure.  We had to stop every five minutes, because he said...  Let's say hi to Mongo from Whack Bag.  Mongo, what's up?  Good morning.  Actually, I'm from Radio Goldfans, but...  Oh, sorry about that.  Radio Goldfans, yes.  That's right.  When I was 22, when I got out of the service, I ended up sleeping with my friend's mom, who 
[00:38:00]  was 52.  And I did that certain task that Anthony was...  Yes.  Alluding to, sure?  Yes.  Um, I wouldn't say it was, uh...  It was Long Island at low tide.  It was...  Wow.  Really?  The Long Island sound.  A few horseshoe crabs, and some barnacles, and seaweed, and some of those old mussels that  have been laying around the sun too long.  It was like chewing liver on the West Shore Expressway. 
[00:38:30]  Mongo, I gotta ask, why, man?  Why?  It was...  I had just gotten out of the service.  It was my friend's mom had...  It was...  Was coming on to me, and it was one of those, hey, it's been a while, why not?  Was it hot because she wanted it so bad?  That's the only thing I could think.  Yeah, it was just...  Might make it, uh...  Yeah, it was just one of those things where the attention was there.  She, you know, someone...  Nobody had paid attention to me in a while, and she was just flirting like crazy. 
[00:39:00]  And I'm like, eh, why not?  But weren't you just getting out of the service?  Weren't you just coming off of, you know, bang-bang girls in some, you know, exotic locale?  One girl in every port?  My first year in the service, I did in the Philippines, and I was all over the prostitutes.  And then the next three years, between Desert Storm and California, I didn't have a single  thing.  I mean, I was completely dead for like three years in California.  You were chaplain.  And then...  Yes. 
[00:39:30]  Chaplain assistant.  So then he gets this 53-year-old...  Hey, dude, can I ask you, uh, what, like, what was the seduction process like?  And when she took her clothes off, you know, describe, like, the undergarments.  What Anthony's, uh, asking is, when did you have your first gulp of...  Of, of brother.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  The first, uh, the first, uh, whiff was, uh, when the, when I actually, you know, if I 
[00:40:00]  remember right, she took her shirt off, and I, and I smelled something.  And that is usually a bad sign.  Smelled America.  That's a smell sign.  We were used to that in the Philippines.  This guy probably rather smell the death around Fallujah.  Again, it's like, smells familiar.  Was she wearing sweatpants and just, like, really odd socks?  Yeah, what was the underwear like?  Uh, it was, it was, uh, old granny panties.  Uh, see?  She wasn't, she wasn't in, in bad shape.  Doesn't matter, though. 
[00:40:30]  You're, see, the point I was trying to make was, you're never gonna see those little boy  shorts on, uh, these old broads.  And if you do, it ain't gonna look good.  And those things are hot.  It definitely wasn't hot.  I mean, it was, it was, uh, okay, thank God there's no lights and lots of alcohol.  I'm actually dry heaving.  I swear to God.  It's.  I'm so close to puking.  Danny's leaving that picture up there.  I know.  Well, because we're looking at that picture as he describes this, it's kind of like, it's  perfect. 
[00:41:00]  And then if you get, you go, you go into the bathroom, maybe at, at some girl's apartment  or something like that, or she brings some stuff.  It's, you know, you open up a cabinet or two.  There's like hot, sexy things in there.  You know?  Girls, all their little lotions and their cute little colorful things that they do.  And then what do you want to see?  Like an old woman's medicine cabinet.  Oh, look, she's got a tube of crack cream for her heels.  Yeah.  You need that.  And then some kind of medication because her womb has fallen out. 
[00:41:30]  She has snake oil, actual.  Real snake oil that she's bought from.  Yes, this elixir will help you.  I don't believe in store-bought medicines now.  I'm interesting and weird.  Mongo, hold on because, well, actually, we're going to let you go.  There's too many people calling in now.  So you've got this guy.  He really likes older women, right?  Dave in Tennessee.  Dave.  Hey, what's up, gentlemen?  What's up, sir?  I mean, I really dig older women. 
[00:42:00]  I think it stems back to my first experience.  I was 13 and she was 32.  And for some reason.  That's pretty cool.  Was it a teacher thing?  It was my best friend's mom, Carol Melissa.  And I spent the night over there and she just hit on me.  We went at it.  So, I mean, it was pretty cool.  How old are you now?  I'm 35.  How old are the women that you like?  Well, I mean, I don't go too old.  Like, 50 is the oldest.  That's too old. 
[00:42:30]  It's not too bad.  It is.  It is.  Oh, what is that?  The 13, 32-year-old combo, like David Tell said, that is hot.  Yeah.  How did she hit on you?  Maybe she was just tucking you in or something.  Maybe you took it the wrong way.  All right, gentlemen.  Pudge it out.  Wow.  That's cool.  13.  Nice.  Now, one guy will complain over that.  But if it's a 32-year-old guy with a 13-year-old girl, now all hell breaks.  Then you're talking to Chris Hansen. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, then all hell breaks.  Dateline NBC.  Such a double standard.  Have some lemonade.  Right.  Chad in Ohio.  Chad.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Come on.  Hey, so I've always been to hook up with an older girl.  Finally got my chance.  She was 42.  I was 21.  And, yeah.  I put my hand down, you know.  All right.  And it was completely unkept.  Yeah.  Ah, see.  Like, I wasn't expecting that because every girl I've ever been with, you know, shaves.  And it was, like, the biggest turnoff ever. 
[00:43:30]  I never want to touch an older woman ever again.  Like you were pulling Punxsutawney Phil out of his little lair.  That's a groundhog joke.  That works.  In August.  Brilliant.  What?  Punxsutawney Phil.  He was 21.  She was 42.  That's like a Hollywood.  That's like a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what's her name?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he banged so many young girls, he probably just got tired of it and he wanted something  different.  Maybe.  When you bang all hot young chicks, then you get bored. 
[00:44:00]  And she did tend to keep herself in shape.  Yeah, she's really hot.  Did you see G.I. Jane?  Hubba hubba.  Hubba hubba.  23 Skadoo.  She had the short hair in G.I. Jane, though.  The body looked good, though, man.  What was that other movie with Burr Reynolds?  Striptease?  Oh, where she was the stripper, yeah.  Yeah.  Where she showed off her implants for the first time?  All right.  Our intern was 19.  She was 38.  And then you got...  Danny, you got a story?  Our own Danny was...  Oh.  Molested?  Well, he was having fun with a 41-year-old that had an 18-year-old daughter. 
[00:44:30]  Danny was two.  She was 78.  No, when I was bartending, I met somebody who was 41 and I was 20.  And she had an 18-year-old son, so that was kind of awkward.  Ugh.  I didn't know you were a road comic.  But I have no complaints.  I don't have any kind of weird, gross stories like these guys.  I was like, it was fine and it was actually really good.  Yeah.  But you obviously, you know, have some kind of issue with mom.  So perhaps... 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  I don't think this had anything to do with it, though.  Yeah?  Seriously.  No.  It was just, she was cool.  We had a good time and that was it.  What comes to mind when we say Danny's mom?  I can't say those words.  It's not on this side.  Yeah.  So the 18-year-old daughter, did you get a look at her?  No, it was a son.  It was a cute...  Well, like I said, did you get a look at her?  It was a cute boy.  Yeah, even hotter.  Did he, like, jump in in the morning and, like, wrestle you or something?  Get over my mom!  No, but I did my best to try to avoid him at the house.  Like, you know, if I saw his car out front, like, I would just, you know, call heads. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, that's embarrassing.  You know how pissed that kid was?  Oh, my...  Yeah.  I'm sure he hated my guts and I'm sure that he knew, like, what was going on and stuff  because there were some nights that I stayed over, but I tried, like, to avoid...  Like, I would, like, run out when he was in the bathroom.  He'd call you the MF word and you'd just go, yep!  You betcha.  Yes, siree!  Did, uh, did, was, uh, your lovemaking very vocal?  In the house?  Did he get...  Would he might have heard, uh, some kind of pleasure? 
[00:46:00]  Maybe, I don't think so.  But it would be funny if it did.  Nothing worse than hearing mom going, ah!  Ah!  Like I said, like, I really tried to avoid being at her, like, at that house.  Like, I didn't want...  What was his name?  I don't remember, to be honest.  Oh, because that would have been hilarious.  This is for you!  Oh, God.  Son's name here.  Wait, can I say the Taboo series?  Taboo 1 and Taboo 2 and Purim are favorite.  Yeah?  Especially Taboo 2.  Well, we all know what Taboo is about.  Yes.  Naughty son and a mother who needed it.  Right. 
[00:46:30]  Stepmother, I thought.  No, no, stepmother.  No, no, no, no, real mother.  Oh, stepmother?  Real mother?  No, they didn't play games.  Kurt, Kurt, and Stephen's directed.  They didn't play games.  Uh, Kay Parker played the mom.  You talk about the director of the Taboo things like it's Scorsese.  No, no, no, this guy, he don't play games.  Kay Parker in the first one seduces her son, and then in part two, um, it's Honey Wilder and her son.  And there's some great, and what happens is these two older women are servicing the younger gentleman, let's just say.  Yes.  And, uh, they're just kind of looking at each other, and the one goes, oh, tell me he tastes like Paul, who's her son. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, God.  Wow.  That is Taboo.  And she goes, oh, please, please don't tell him, because the guy that they were with was friends with the son, and he goes, oh, please don't tell him.  She goes, okay.  And then she was so campy, she puts her mouth by the guy's ear and goes, I won't tell him you effed Paul.  And he goes, do you effed Paul?  It was so great.  We got to find that clip now.  Yeah, it was really sexy.  Hey, here's a guy that married a cougar. 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  David in Indiana.  David.  Hello, gentlemen.  Hi.  I got, uh, I was 23, and I met my wife, um, she was 35, and I'd always been into older women.  And, um, honestly, younger, younger girls, younger women, whatever, they just have stupid.  Ass is like snare drums.  Is that a problem?  I understand, though.  My wife is in perfect shape.  I mean, she takes care of herself. 
[00:48:00]  She works out six days a week, three hours a day.  And now you got to, you got to, you got to add on.  Perfect shape for, uh, whatever year old.  And the problem is that you have to say she takes care of herself.  Yeah.  Young girls never have to say that.  They're just.  There's only so much you can do on Earth.  There's something called gravity that will take its toll.  Right.  But I'm, I'm, I'm 29 now, and she's 42, 43.  All right.  So, you know, it's, it's, it's, she's in the exact same shape she was six years ago.  But I know that you're right. 
[00:48:30]  You know, she's, you got to take care of herself.  Uh, younger girls fall apart, too, though.  Well, I'll give you that.  Some of them can, but.  Well, doesn't it keep you on your game?  Because, like, you can't use all those, like, you know, you know, those, uh, young girl tricks, you know, like, you know, like, I'm just different.  Or, you know, like, say all those weird things that you say.  I'm just different.  You know, like, duh, it's not you, it's.  But she's also afraid, she's also afraid that I'm going to leave her for a younger girl.  Good.  She's also on her game, too.  Well, it looks like someone needs to see Dr. Three-Way. 
[00:49:00]  Split the difference, as we used to say.  Dr. Three-Way.  All right, thanks, David.  All right, boys, thank you.  Let's squeeze one more in, and then we've got to take a break.  We've got David Tell in studio.  Justin, New York, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Yo, my first, uh, she was 32 when I was 14.  She was my schooler.  Was she the bus driver?  Yo, she was the bus driver, bro.  I hung out for, like, four months. 
[00:49:30]  That is great, man.  The bus driver.  That was a lot of fun.  Were you the last stop?  It was one of those things where all the last kids would get off,  and you'd be like, hey, how you doing?  You move up front.  Yeah.  Start massaging her leg as she's double-clutching.  Start getting excited.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  You start getting excited as she's getting closer to the yard.  Yeah, the old yard.  Does that set you up for, like, I mean, did you continuously hook up like that, 
[00:50:00]  like, through your tweens?  I mean, was there a dry period?  Well, we hung out for, like, four months, and it was a great time.  But actually, before it started, she started changing the route because I was in the middle.  Then all of a sudden, she was picking me up first and dropping me off last.  Wow.  That's what gave me the idea, like, what is she doing, you know?  So, and then we hung out for, like, three or four months, and it was a great time, man.  I hope your schoolwork didn't suffer.  Missed out on a lot of extracurriculars. 
[00:50:30]  I got one even better than that.  My brother is married to a girl that's 20 years older than him.  Wow.  Wow, you guys have mommy issues.  Yeah.  When did mommy leave?  Not at all.  Not at all.  No.  All right, thank you.  Well, how old is she?  She's like, uh...  80.  That's what I want to hear, something ridiculous.  I hooked up, I was 15, she was 92.  Yeah.  Something really off-kilter. 
[00:51:00]  So, like, when you see these pictures of these women in that Georgia invasion, they get you hard?  It's always, like, some old, kind of gypsy-looking woman screaming at the sky.  The babushka on her head.  I think some guy must find that, like, erotic, like, look at her.  Oh, man.  Wish I could invade her.  It's like someone's bringing up Ruth Gordon.  I'll talk.  Ruth Gordon, the ultimate cougar.  Oh, yeah.  Harry, what's it?  Harold and Maude.  Harold and Maude was a movie.  Yeah, yeah.  A young guy, and he was into her. 
[00:51:30]  Wow, what are we watching here, Danny?  Oh, that's the Taboo 2.  That's the Taboo 2.  That's the scene?  We're a bit distracted.  Two girls are together.  Everything is available.  Kay Parker in Taboo 2.  One girl is, and Peg is massaging Kay Parker.  And then Junior, played by Kevin James.  Oh, I see.  Kevin James from the King of Queens, by the way.  Kevin James.  He's gone a long way.  Yeah.  He's a friend.  King of Queens.  The girl being massaged, Kay Parker, on her back.  Yes.  Her son Paul was in Taboo 1.  She had sex with him.  He's not in Taboo 2.  Paul.  So they meet at the card shop. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, of course.  And now the guy, Junior, comes by with some tools, just as an excuse to come over, and  walks into the two girls.  And then in comes Pat Barringer.  A lovely Bucksotic.  Thank you, Steve.  Oh, this is a damn.  Break out the clips.  Oh, yeah.  It's break time.  Damn.  Break out the clips.  Stuntbrain's getting angry.  He's held up that sign twice.  With Junior rules, he just wears these white pants with no underwear.  You guys wear eyes on them.  From highbrow conversations with Hollywood's elite. 
[00:52:30]  It was very hard for me to be bored with the Wagner opera.  Fair enough.  To comics getting finger banged in a taxi cab.  I was in the frenzy of the cab.  I took his hand and went.  Oh, my God.  2012 has provided the full spectrum of radio gold.  Ice kill.  Ice kill.  That's amazing.  You guys are one of the most popular radio shows.  Oh, my squeegee.  I'm not a vampire.  Vampire.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012 starts. 
[00:53:00]  It's the Worst of 2012 for the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is Erock.  I think the production that just played said everything except who I am,  so I had to say that.  But I had to say the other stuff, too, because they make me do that.  But whatever.  You know what's going on here.  If you don't, I'll fill you in.  We're going to go back from January, the beginning of this year,  right up to this point and try to play all the most memorable stuff that happened on  the Opie and Anthony show.  And we only have a few days to do it.  We only have a certain amount of time today to get stuff in.  And if you listen to all of this and you go, what the hell? 
[00:53:30]  I like this particular segment.  Why didn't you put that in there?  That was my favorite.  Well, you know what?  Be lucky that you got to hear it in the first place.  Otherwise, we didn't have time.  And I'm putting in what I can here.  So fucking deal with it.  Or look online somewhere.  Maybe YouTube.  I don't know.  But we start everything right now with looking at Amy Schumer.  Now, a few segments throughout the year, Amy has really opened up to our audience and  to this show about her sex life and growing up and all the things that she has done. 
[00:54:00]  And each time she's on, there's a story more unbelievable than the last.  This is a bit of a montage of several appearances from this year where she starts off talking  about sexting and her sex life.  It goes into about maybe the first time she had sex, something involving date rape.  She'll explain that.  And finally, it ends with the infamous story now of her being in a cab and seducing a cab  driver to finger her.  O.B. and Anthony's Worst of 2012.  Sexting? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It can be really fun if you're alone in a hotel room for enough time.  Yeah.  It's all necessity.  Yeah.  I write really sexy shit.  Like, I'm going to, I'm going to come up your crack.  LOL.  Oh, that was so cute.  LOL.  LOL is the hottest part about it.  Yeah, the LOL is hot.  I had the worst sexting experience with a guy lately.  I was, I had plans.  I was going to have sex with this guy.  Like, it was going in that direction.  Okay.  But that's how bad the phone sex went. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, no.  Yes.  Wow.  Okay.  So I wrote something to him, like, um, something like, I'm going to, I'm going to sit on your  face or just something, you know, something really beautiful.  Like, of course.  Poetry.  I was writing Shakespeare.  So then, and like something about, I don't know.  I don't remember, but it was something like pulling his hair or something.  I don't know.  And then, uh, the guy wrote back, um, yeah, like, I'm going to go down on you.  Like, it's my job.  But, but like, but oral has to go both ways.  And, and I was like, whoa, wait, he said, I'm going to go down on you. 
[00:55:30]  Like, it's my job.  Like, it's my job.  That's a horror.  First of all, it was bad.  That's terrible.  It was so bad.  And I go, and then I go, this isn't a negotiate.  Like, I feel like I was on a used car lot and he was like, well, we'll throw in the free  air conditioning, but, and I was just like, you know what, this is, he goes, do you want  to try again?  I was like, no.  Oral goes both ways.  Who would say that when you're being both ways?  My client would like to receive some oral.  I was like, guess who's in the friend zone? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  That was it.  That oral goes both ways.  Oral's going to go both ways.  It's not like you're even in the room trying to avoid some cock sucking.  It was the worst.  I was just like, ugh.  That's fucking awful.  I don't think I even masturbated for like a week after that.  Wow.  That guy's like, no thanks.  That guy fucked up.  He does, and he knew, he knew it the next day.  He's like, yeah, that, we really blew it.  I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We?  You blew it.  Yeah.  Let's call a spade a spade here.  It's like the Kobayashi Maru. 
[00:56:30]  There's nothing worse than a terrible dirty texture.  I can be nonstop.  Like, I'm an addict, so I can see somebody going, just pretend they don't see it.  Yeah, just like, all right.  Right already, we get it.  You want to smell my ass?  I fucking heard you.  Dear mom.  That's amazing.  But it's the fucking ones that are just duds and don't know how to write.  It's like, you fucking, you're horrible.  That sucks.  Yeah.  They won't even send you, I hate when people that won't send you a dirty, like, any type 
[00:57:00]  of photo.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Have fun.  Live your life.  Oh, God, there are, I have to really have a good relationship with every ex, or, like,  God knows, the shitstorm that would hit the internet.  I fucking was talking to this one girl, and she was just really pretty, and I liked her,  but she was such a fucking dud.  I didn't even try to talk dirty to her.  I mentioned something about sex, like, something sexually, but I wasn't, and she's like, oh,  wait, talking about, what did she say?  Uh-oh.  Talking about sex, I'm going to take a big pass. 
[00:57:30]  Ew.  And I said, I feel like I'm talking to my grandmother, and I never spoke to her again.  I'm going to take a big pass.  Yeah, just like, no.  No wonder you're single.  Right.  Stupid.  That's why you're 30 and single, you unsexy dud.  That's awful.  That, because her boyfriend had cheated on her.  That's why he fucked somebody else, idiot.  Yeah.  Because you're a dud.  You're a fucking dud.  Was that in a text?  You're a fucking dud.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a big, I would say that.  Dude, I wasn't even being dirty.  Right.  It was literally, she was so, she was such a fucking lump. 
[00:58:00]  That's so funny.  Jimmy gets so like, he's so bad, he's physically pissed off.  But I, dude, I so understood why her boyfriend cheated on her.  I'm like, that's why he fucked somebody else.  Like, I don't cheat.  But I'm like a monogamous whore.  Like, if a guy cheated on me, it would be to have just normal sex with somebody.  He'd like find some nice girl where it would just be normal vanilla sex.  A little too outrageous.  I met her at church, and I took her home.  Yeah, I find myself just being... 
[00:58:30]  A Christian mingle.  Yeah.  A Christian mingle.  There must just be some horrendously, like, crazy sex going on on that, though.  Yeah.  Repressed fucking...  Oh, that's the creepiest.  Whenever I see that commercial.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let Jesus match you up.  The guy from religious backgrounds, they are the wildest in bed, I find.  Girls, too.  Yeah, totally.  I, like, found that they're really fucking crazy.  Yeah.  I don't know why that is.  Something about Catholic school, they just...  I don't know.  They were just like, fuck you, mom.  Bunch of sisters. 
[00:59:00]  Bunch of sisters.  They're not nuns.  They were literally sisters.  Sisters.  Years ago.  Black and sisters.  Huge.  Catholic upbringing was crazy.  Yeah.  The parents had to know everything they were doing, and they were insane.  Yeah.  Insanely wild.  Could knock it out of the house and get into anywhere to have sex faster.  They just loved having sex.  Just wanted something.  Just, yeah.  Get away from that whole Jesus thing.  A lot of leaky submarine going on.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Religious, are you?  No.  No?  Not really.  What are you supposed to be?  I'm Catholic.  Yeah, Italian.  That kind of goes with it, I guess.  I don't go to church and stuff, but...  No?  I'm not super religious.  I mean, I believe in God, but I'm not...  Yeah.  You've got to believe in God because you're afraid.  You need some kind of hope.  Yeah, exactly.  I can't think it all just ends.  God's not going to help you on the subway when you get raped.  That's true.  That's true.  Repeatedly by 13-year-old Latin girls.  13-year-old.  We learned, yeah.  We're very Latina chicks.  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  I'm annoyed at that guy.  What guy?  Oh, I know.  The guy was...  Girls are too easy?  It's going to go both ways.  It's going to go both ways.  It's going to go both ways.  Why would you say that?  I just was like, nope.  I go, you're ruining this.  You know you're ruining this?  Did you say that?  Yeah.  Good for you.  I could show you the conversation if I didn't want you to see the name.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, Amy.  Oh, Lenny Marcus.  I'm kidding.  I'm totally kidding.  Lenny's a great guy. 
[01:00:30]  He'd be an awful dirty text.  Can you imagine trying to dirty text with Lenny?  Oh, that'd be amazing.  I kind of want to do that.  Write something.  You'd write something like, I want to suck your cock, and for an hour, he'd write back,  you're crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's like, I'm uploading software on my computer right now.  You have to know iPad where you just ignore it, pretend you didn't see it.  Oh, no.  So change the name.  Put a different name.  I don't care who it is.  Okay.  All right.  I'll show it to you.  You ever use the same fucking scenarios in your sexting and hope that they never talk  to each other about it, like two people out of randomly? 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  It's like, this is a good one.  This is a proven scenario I have here.  I actually have it in my notepad.  I could just copy and paste.  Copy, paste, sexting.  Yeah, that's a good one.  All right.  I'll throw the hands against the wall thing.  Yeah.  No, it's got to be genuine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's that same thing with some, if somebody's like, kind of like, oh, I guess I'll try to  spank you.  You feel it.  You're like, oh, come on.  I'll try to spank you.  You're trying.  All right.  Do it or don't.  You're failing.  No, I personalize it.  I'll like, I'll, I'll, I'll write things from today's paper. 
[01:01:30]  I'll be like, I'm going to push your face into the March Madness bracket signs.  Shuck my cock where the poo comes out.  Well, I know he wrote it today.  Look, it's today's headlines.  Suck my caucus.  Political humor.  Political humor.  It's too political.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  That way they know it's that day.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No.  Oh, she said she has relationship troubles.  Wow.  What's wrong with you in relationship?  You're afraid of guys too?  Are you afraid of everything? 
[01:02:00]  They pull their penis out.  She's like, ah, what is that?  You're like a chihuahua in a thunderstorm.  She screams like Fay Wray.  Run into the bathtub.  I did not touch him.  Did he ask you to?  Oh, no.  But what happened was we got where we were going.  And so like my friend in the back kind of woke up.  Mm-hmm.  And he was like, where are we taking this party?  Like he was kind of like.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's good.  And I was.  He was the winner of Gash Cab.  Oh, my God. 
[01:02:30]  How long have you been sitting on that?  I just thought of it.  I swear.  That just popped up.  That was too good.  That was strong.  Yes.  Wait, wait.  No, Chip.  It was like Pussy of Fortune.  No, that doesn't work, Chip.  Not Pussy of Fortune.  Chip, that doesn't work.  Oh, God.  How long did it take to come?  I hate thinking of the plot points of this show.  Yeah, yeah.  How many blocks?  We get it.  I know.  How many minutes?  I came right before we got there.  So what happened? 
[01:03:00]  He wanted to know.  And what did you pay for the thing?  The cab?  Yeah.  Did he make you pay?  What?  What a dick.  I love it.  She wasn't going to jerk him off.  He's like, all right, $8.50.  What a dick.  Who's it easier for him to separate the dollar bills?  Me and my friend.  He fucking made you pay?  Me and my friend.  I'm sure we split it.  I would not have been like this.  So wait, what did he say to you?  He was like, so as soon as I came, I was disgusted with myself and him.  And he was just like, where are we going?  We? 
[01:03:30]  And I was like, and I just got out of the cab and I was like, come on, let's go to the girl.  And he was like, wait, well, like, you know, he was confused.  Confused, yeah.  And then I was like kind of scared.  And we went inside the house.  And then I felt really gross about it, of course, because it's fucking really gross.  That is pretty gross.  And so I, and I like, yeah, we walked away from the cab and I felt so bad about it.  I told my mom the next day.  Why would you do that?  Because I was like, what's going on with me? 
[01:04:00]  Why am I?  How do you tell your mom that?  I told her.  I was like, it was sort of like, um, I think it was really selfish of me just to want to  get some guilt out of my life.  Wow.  So what did she do when you told her?  No, she probably turned on.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  She grabbed Amy's hand and put it on her vagina.  Yeah, to make me pissed her.  And she asked, oh, was it the black one that I've hooked up with?  I was like, oh, mom.  That's so mom.  Oh, no.  Wow.  So what did she say to you?  Uh, I think she was concerned.  Yeah.  And, um, and she, but she was like, she comforted me. 
[01:04:30]  Like, it's okay.  Like, what do you say to your daughter?  Mom, um.  There, there.  I just let.  Now, was the, um.  Sorry.  I'm just going to have a turn on it.  Can you imagine like.  Oh, sorry.  Can you imagine like something happened to a boy, like a little boy and like the boy  goes to his dad and.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he got jerked off in a cab.  Like that would just never happen.  Dad, I got jerked off in the cab.  I'd be like, that's my boy.  Exactly.  But you know what?  Like that is still, I like, I like watching porn where the guy's really gross. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  And the girl's like beautiful and like innocent.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  So you were molested by an ugly guy.  Yeah.  Well, I mean.  No, I mean.  Watch my home movies.  When you were.  No, I'm saying when you were a lot younger.  See the flow chart.  Yeah.  It goes back to Jimmy's flow chart.  You were molested by some greasy old guy.  Oh, no.  Well, I don't remember.  Older guy.  That's.  That's a great.  If that happened, I don't.  That memory hasn't come up yet.  That's a good molestation if you don't remember.  That just means it was really deep.  Those are the best ones when your memories go bye-bye.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:30]  Let me ask you this.  Have you ever gone back in time and masturbated to that whole scenario?  No.  No, that made me, like, really ill for a while after.  And I think only now that it's, you know, over 10 years later can I.  That's crazy.  Well over 10 years.  Shut up.  Where were you.  Shut up.  You shit.  Fuck you.  I'm just kidding.  That's fucking funny.  She's petting.  Petting a couple years.  Oh, shit.  Amy, where were you coming from?  What a dick.  I'm just teasing her.  Freaking monsters. 
[01:06:00]  I'll be changing your diapers in less than a decade.  Where were you coming from that you couldn't.  A bar.  But you couldn't hook up at the bar?  Somebody was gas bartending.  It wasn't about that.  It was about being self-destructive.  That's self-destructive.  Yeah.  She didn't want to hook up and have a natural connection.  I did a bunch of self-destructive, dangerous kind of stuff.  Was that after the rape?  Yeah.  Oh, see?  Okay.  Was it all after that?  Yeah.  Why didn't you touch his penis?  Wouldn't that have played into what you were going for that night?  No.  No? 
[01:06:30]  No.  Jeez.  That was just self-punishment.  All self-punishment.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  After the...  Crazy.  Wow.  It was crazy.  I did crazy stuff then.  I'm not going to tell any more today because it's a lot.  But there was...  There's got to be stuff even crazier than that.  What were gross?  That was the gross.  That was one of the...  How many...  That was up there.  How many guys most have you been with at one time?  One.  Oh, that's it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, no.  I never was just like a cum dumpster, no.  I never was a cum dumpster.  And it was always, like, very selfish shit about me. 
[01:07:00]  I didn't, like, go nuts on everybody's cocks.  Good for you.  Good for you.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Yeah.  A lot of people saying the cab driver remembers this story and tells it a lot.  Oh, he's still telling that one.  As you were telling it, he was telling it.  Because he's telling it all the fucking time.  I wonder if he...  I bet he looks like a listener of this show.  Yeah.  And I bet...  I bet...  It was me.  Oh, God.  It's a lot of cab drivers saying that.  Dude!  Dude, it was me, dude!  Oh, I hope so.  Oh, that would be good.  Yeah, he dropped the...  I hope it was fucking Big A.  He used to drive a fucking delivery car. 
[01:07:30]  I...  F...  F...  F...  F...  Finger...  Hey!  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012.  Coming up.  There's someone on the line saying that you were in a bar fight with Jesse Ventura.  Is that true?  Oh, God.  It's probably...  Is it?  Yes.  You were?  Oh, shit.  Oh, let's get into this.  Yeah, I would like to know.  Did you talk about it?  I was going to ask you how you felt about it, actually.  We...  We...  I don't know.  How do you explain it? 
[01:08:00]  There's a verbal altercation in here.  But he used to come on our show, and it was all right.  We didn't agree with a lot of the stuff he said, but we had an okay time.  Thank you for your service.  But then we had a moment where he walked off our show because we just killed him with knowledge.  Yeah, we had a big argument.  Especially Jimmy.  We had a big argument, yeah.  Jimmy does a good impression of him, too.  And it was just uncomfortable.  And he was...  Whatever.  I wanted to ask how you felt about him as a SEAL.  But if you had a bar fight, were you stressing the difference?  Is there a difference between when UDT, or what happened?  No, no, no, no. 
[01:08:30]  Being UDT, I fully respect that.  SEALs were born out of UDT.  So I consider him, yes, he's a SEAL.  He's part of the family.  I don't draw a distinction between them.  Okay.  What happened in the bar?  Yeah, what happened?  You were in a bar and...  Oh, Jesus.  We had just come back from our 06 deployment when we lost our guys.  We were having a wake for the guy who got the Medal of Honor, Mikey Monsoor.  And he happened to be there.  He was coming in for a graduating BUDS class that he was going to speak to. 
[01:09:00]  And he was upset with the war.  He doesn't agree with it, which is fine.  You don't have to agree with the war.  I just get sent there.  I don't have to agree with politics.  I signed up to serve the country.  The country tells me what to do.  He was making it known that he did not agree with it.  And I approached him and said, hey, you know...  It's not the place.  I appreciate it, but we are having a wake.  It was the SEAL bar there in town.  I said, we're having the wake here.  The family's here.  I would appreciate it if you just kind of keep it down. 
[01:09:30]  He told us that we were killing innocent people over there.  Men, women, children, that we were murderers.  And I said, you know what?  We can all have our differences.  That's fine.  But please just don't upset the family.  And then he said that, you know, we deserve to lose a few guys.  Holy shit.  Jesse said that?  Yes.  What the fuck is wrong with him?  So, by the way, all you guys out there that attacked me because I fucking attacked him.  Good.  I'm glad to hear that.  He really is a douche. 
[01:10:00]  And what happened when he said that to you?  Did you grab his ponytail?  No.  You slugged him?  Good.  I punched him.  I punched him.  Good for you.  Where'd you punch him?  Bravo.  In the face.  What happened?  That's when you take a head shot.  Well, I mean, Jesse Ventura, he's a big man.  He's an older guy, too.  Yeah, he's an older guy.  Of course, all the guys then started making fun of me.  So, what geriatric are you going to be up to?  Yeah, of course.  When you hit him, did he hit you back?  No, he went down.  Oh.  Like, was he? 
[01:10:30]  I don't think he was out.  It definitely took him off balance.  He went down.  But the ref wasn't looking.  They never are.  Did his walker fall with him?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think he fell out of his wheelchair.  He's a big dude, man.  Wow, he went down.  He's a big dude.  He's still Jesse the body.  I mean, he's an older guy, but he's still a big, strong guy.  Did he awkwardly get up and have to walk out of the place?  I don't know.  I took off running because the cops were already outside.  And as soon as I hit him, I knew seal party, seal bar.  Cops were watching. 
[01:11:00]  They saw the whole thing happen.  So, I took off running.  Yeah.  So, Jesse Ventura said to a seal at a bar where there was a wake for a seal, you deserve  to lose a few guys.  Yes, he did.  Repugnant.  So, you make me even happy because he and I got into a very, very nasty exchange.  Because I was defending kind of action.  Al-Qaeda.  Yes.  And I said, you know what?  They're nice people, Jesse.  No, I said that I kind of agreed with the Afghanistan action.  And he was saying that I'm just a guy who didn't serve, who was for the war. 
[01:11:30]  And I'm like, but that's not where I'm coming from.  I'm not saying fucks, just go out and fight.  It wasn't at all.  So, we just got into an ugly thing.  And it got personal.  What an ass he is.  A douche.  But he really hates my gut.  So, I'm so happy you did that because I'm not a man.  Like, I couldn't stand up and punch him.  What happened was, as we kept arguing, he patted me on the back hard.  And I knew he was like, as he was leaving, he's like, thanks for your service.  But it was like one of those.  And for me to match him, I would have had to pat it.  And I'm like, I'm not going to do what you did.  I wish I was him, though. 
[01:12:00]  How great would that have been to just slug him?  So, I insulted him.  Yeah, I'm sure I just caught him off balance and he tripped.  Yeah, that must have been it.  Sure.  Good for you, man.  That must have been it.  I'm so happy.  This is O&A's Worst of 2012 on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  Hi, Chris.  How are you?  What's up, Chris?  Not much.  How y'all doing?  Well, you told the story on our show that you punched Jesse Ventura in a bar.  And, wow.  The story took off, man.  Was this the first place you'd ever told that story publicly? 
[01:12:30]  Well, yes.  I mean, for a big audience like that, I mean, the event is in the book, but I purposely left  his name out because I didn't want that whole thing to take off like that.  And then ever since then, I've been trying to kind of deflect questions from it because  I'm not trying to make money off of putting him down or anything.  Yeah, we got a tip that it was Jesse Ventura.  We asked you, and you decided to say yes to that and admit it was Jesse Ventura because 
[01:13:00]  like you said in the book, it's very vague.  You said you punched a guy, a fuzzy-faced guy, was it?  Was that the exact thing?  Yeah, scruffy face.  Scruffy face.  Right, right.  Well, a lot of people are now calling you a liar.  I believe you, by the way.  Yeah, so do I.  Yeah, so far we believe you, absolutely.  They can call me wherever they want because I know this thing has gotten so blown up that  the only way to actually put it to rest is the witnesses.  I have asked them to stay out of it to where finally now I've said, you know what, just 
[01:13:30]  go ahead, come out with it, and we can put this behind us.  Oh, you have actually asked them to speak up because there was audio we heard of Ventura,  of course.  You probably heard it, too, where he's denying ever meeting you, and he's harping on the  fact that a crime has been committed and maybe he should file charges.  Yeah, he definitely should if he thinks that's right.  Do you regret it at all?  You know what?  I wish I would have handled it differently. 
[01:14:00]  I mean, I don't.  I mean, the story, I think, definitely needed to be in the book like it is.  But as far as, yeah, I probably should have played it down to where his name didn't get  out there, but you know what?  It is now, so I'm...  What exactly happened, Chris?  If you could just refresh, because a lot of people might not have heard you on that moment.  Just if you could give us a brief, just kind of sum the story up so people know what we're  talking about.  It was a wake for Mikey Monsoor, and of course, all the families were there. 
[01:14:30]  He was there.  I started getting loud and voicing his opinion coming out against the war and the troops and  everything, so we asked him to keep it down, and he got belligerent about it and finally  said we deserve to lose a few.  Yeah, that's way over the line.  Now, was he, he was there, this was in a bar, just so people know.  Yes, it was the outside patio portion of a bar, and we were standing on the sidewalk 
[01:15:00]  of it.  Now, was he with anybody, or was he alone, to your knowledge?  No, I mean, he was definitely there at the bar with people.  Oh, he was with people.  So there's a few people that saw this?  Oh, there's a bunch of people that saw this.  Yeah, and they've spoken about it, like, in smaller circles over the years.  It's not like this has been a complete secret.  Oh, no.  I mean, the entire community has known about this.  And there's a room, like, there's a radio guy who's friends with Jesse Ventura, who thinks 
[01:15:30]  that we all scripted this together, I guess because Opie just happened to look over at  the instant feedback, which is the one time instant feedback actually, you know, gave us  something helpful.  Actually, it was a phone call.  Oh, a phone call, okay.  It seemed like it might have been someone that really knows Chris Kyle, and was kind of  just, you know, hoping that you were finally going to mention the name.  But Alex Jones says that it's a conspiracy.  We were in on the conspiracy, even though we just met you that morning.  And by the way, we thought you were awesome.  Yeah.  We think you're the greatest. 
[01:16:00]  People loved you on the show, man.  And they also, Alex Jones also says, we scripted the whole thing.  So we helped you along, and we got together, and we came up with this whole thing.  Right.  I've heard all those rumors.  Jesse was the wrestler.  He did the scripted stuff, not other people.  And also, I love how Chris Kyle's admitting that he told us first, because Bill O'Reilly  took this fucking story and stole it from us, that cocksucker.  Cocksucker.  Yeah, he kind of ran with it like he just, whatever. 
[01:16:30]  Well, we got Alex Jones on the line, too.  He wants in on this.  You cool with that, Chris?  Definitely.  All right.  Hey, Alex.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Alex.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I like the show.  I also like Norton when he's on the Boneyard.  All right.  Thank you very much, man.  Don't kiss ass right now.  Well, we got to kiss people.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's not kiss anyone's ass right now.  All right.  Hey, hey.  I actually listen to that channel.  I mean, so I'm just saying I listen to it. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, you're kissing a little ass, because you know you're in a tough spot right now,  sir.  Why did you call us liars, and why did you say that we were in on a conspiracy with Chris Kyle  and that we scripted this thing?  Okay.  Well, number one, I'm not in a tough place.  I was just trying to be friendly.  I just woke up about 15 minutes.  No, no, no.  You're in a tough place.  No, I'm not in a tough place.  Jesse Ventura lied on your show.  I'm on UFOwars.com.  Jesse Ventura lied on your show, sir.  Alex, so what happened?  You thought that we scripted this with Chris Kyle, which is ludicrous.  What are you thinking there?  No. 
[01:17:30]  Let me tell you what I meant by that.  I'm saying the way he was talking, you know, then somebody calls in with it, and the way  he was talking, I think it was scripted.  I did not think and did not say that I thought you guys were in on the lie.  I was watching your face on the video, and it looks like you're, you know, they're believing  it and hearing it for the first time, so you guys aren't even on the radar screen as far  as I'm concerned with this whole deal, but I know Jesse pretty damn well, and see him  get tears in his eyes and stuff when he talks to troops in airports and stuff. 
[01:18:00]  I mean, quite frankly, if he sees troops, he runs over, or they run over to him, and  it goes on and on, and it's the same thing about, it's the politicians that have sent  you, and it's wrong, and it's just, it's terrible what's happening to you, and all this  stuff.  So when I, I mean, when I heard him talk about punching him and knocking him down, I thought,  well, that sounds wild, but could be true, but as soon as he said the thing on O'Reilly  and stuff about, yeah, he said, you deserve to die, you guys deserve to die when the family's 
[01:18:30]  right there, that is made up, period, I knew it was bull then, and guaranteed, Ventura, I've  never even heard him, after I did that interview the other day on Skype, he was like, I heard  him like almost crying in the background, his wife totally angry.  So, believe me, Ventura's not getting ready to depose people and go absolutely ape over  nothing.  He doesn't have people over there at that McPee's place getting, you know, getting affidavits  signed and stuff for nothing.  All right, listen.  Totally made up.  All right, listen, so you have no doubt that Chris Kyle did not punch Jesse Ventura. 
[01:19:00]  No, what I just said is, I was going back to when I watched the video last week, when  he first said...  Did Chris Kyle punch Jesse Ventura or not?  Well, let me just stop you right there, Ventura denies that it ever happened.  And do you believe that?  Absolutely.  But what I'm telling you is, watching the video, knowing Ventura, okay, knowing him well, I'm  watching the video, and the guy's saying, you know, he was talking about the war and  punched him.  I'm thinking, well, that might have happened. 
[01:19:30]  When he gets to the part about, yeah, he said the SEALs deserve to die, and when he said  it on O'Reilly, it looked really scripted by him.  You know, he was following a script.  I knew it was pure bull, and as soon as I talked to Ventura, as soon as I could get  a hold of him, sure enough, he was completely dumbfounded.  Hold on, Alex.  All right, all right.  We've got to jump in a little bit, because don't forget, Chris is not a public figure,  so he's not used to speaking publicly.  So when he's talking about things that he's not used to talking about, on Bill O'Reilly,  a show he's probably watched for 10 years, it might be a little bit more nerve-wracking. 
[01:20:00]  And we do have Chris here to respond to that.  We have to let him respond.  Yeah.  Chris, how do you feel about it?  We'll get to respond in court.  Well, no, I mean, right now, Chris?  Yeah, that's fine.  I mean, I've got the people that are definitely going to come out, and some of them are the  family members that were there, so I'm not too concerned.  And Chris, what did he say about the Navy SEALs dying?  I think that that's being misquoted.  What did he say?  Yeah, you are misquoting it, Alex.  What did he say, Chris?  He said you deserve to lose a few.  Deserve to lose a few.  Yeah, that means deserve to die.  Well, it does.  What it means and what was said. 
[01:20:30]  Don't try Perry Mason crap.  You have been misquoting the man the whole time you've ever...  Hey, Kyle, you think you're going to make a big name for your new American mercenary  force to help knock heads of American people?  Think again.  I know all about Richard Perl, all about your trips to Israel, all of it, buddy boy.  Who is Richard Perl?  What is...  Who is Richard Perl?  You're more entertaining, Alex.  I'll give you that.  Who is Richard Perl?  Yeah, it'll all come out.  And by the way, Alex, we're not giving you...  Who is Richard Perl? 
[01:21:00]  And we're also not giving you Perry Mason stuff and playing semantics games.  The difference...  To me, it's more believable for Jesse Ventura to say, you guys deserve to lose a few, than  to say something as harsh as, I'm glad Navy SEALs are dying.  There is a difference in believability in what one guy would say, and I don't think Jesse  Ventura would come out and go, I'm glad a soldier's dead.  Look, that's the same thing, and that's how...  No, it's not!  ...he's telling it that he's saying the Navy SEALs deserve to lose a few.  That is saying, lose a few means die. 
[01:21:30]  It absolutely does, but there is a difference in the way you say it.  Right.  One is more believable to me.  Well, Chris, listen, I hope for your sake that you are telling the truth.  And, you know, I mean, Ventura's so freaked out by this, he's saying, you know, do they  have a body double of me or something?  Let me say, I'll talk to him off-air.  That's paranoia.  He is completely, he is completely flummoxed and dumbfounded.  I'm flummoxed and dumbfounded.  Chris, were you tempted to put Jesse's name in the book?  Because, Alex, one thing that makes this more believable to me is that Chris did not put 
[01:22:00]  the name in the book.  The publisher probably said he couldn't prove it.  The publisher...  Now, Chris Kyle is saying today, Alex, that he can prove this, and a lot of the guys that  know about this, he finally told them, yeah, you could tell everyone what you saw that  day.  Okay, well, that's not what the owner of the bar is going to say.  Now, Chris, why didn't you put it in the book, honestly?  Because I didn't want this whole reaction to come out here.  Yes, I'm not trying to sell my book off of making someone else look bad. 
[01:22:30]  And, Alex, is it possible, because we heard you calling, Chris, you called it the turkey  shoot, and is it possible that your agenda...  Look, you don't like the war, it's common knowledge, and you love Jesse.  Isn't it possible that your agenda is skewing the way you're looking at this?  Well, yeah, I mean, we all see through rose-colored glasses, and, you know, I'm a Texan, you  know, I mean, I'm sure Kyle at some point is a, you know, friendly guy.  My whole issue here is when I say turkey shoot, not that I follow too much of this military 
[01:23:00]  stuff, but I love families in the military, and, of course, there's the big joke about,  you know, the Haji's don't know how to aim a gun, my God, you know, there were people  there who couldn't believe the kill numbers everybody was getting, and when you're shooting  women running around with hangar nades, and you're shooting, I mean, plus there's all  the contractor footage of them playing Elvis music and shooting whole families out of  their cars, and then dropping AK-47s on them, I mean, that's the big joke, every armored  vehicle, and Kyle knows this, it's full of drop guns, and they splatter a whole bunch of 
[01:23:30]  people at a checkpoint or whatever, dropping AK-47 on them, y'all get, you know, bronze  stars for kills in combat.  I'm not saying that's exactly what Kyle did, but it's all well-known about Iraq.  Kyle, Kyle, how do you respond?  The Iranian war started.  Yeah, you were over there, you must have seen it, Alex, right?  Kyle, how do you respond to that?  You gotta let Kyle respond, you can't make an accusation like that, not let Kyle respond,  he's gotta respond.  Kyle?  Oh, Chris, I'm sorry.  No problem.  We've never had drop weapons on us, but I can tell you, as far as the book, it's not 
[01:24:00]  sitting there trying to glorify all the people I've killed, it's trying to get across the  sacrifices that a military member has to go through while he's overseas, and at the same  time, my wife is telling the sacrifices she went through while here at home, and I'm trying  to highlight the heroes that surrounded me that made me look good, and all through the  book, I downplay myself.  And one thing you said, Chris, too, when you were on, is that people were trying to inflate  the number to two-something, and Alex, you didn't hear the interview, but Chris kept  going, no, no, no, I'm happy with it, this is fine, like, I don't need any more numbers 
[01:24:30]  attributed to me.  He was downplaying everything that day.  And on your show...  Let me be clear, I think in war, a sniper is an honorable position, people always try  to make it look bad, I've interviewed a lot of snipers like Colonel Craig Roberts and  others we did in Vietnam, and I'm not downplaying that Chris can't shoot a gnat off a fence  post at 1,000 yards.  I'm simply saying that it's well known, just like with the Army helicopter shooting  up the Reuters van, that as far as turkey shoot goes, there were times when you just 
[01:25:00]  have all sorts of mayhem and people being blasted in all directions, and it's a lot  easier to be a sniper in the desert or in those built-up mount areas than it was in, say,  Southeast Asia.  I mean, that's my point about turkey shoot.  Clearly, Kyle, would it have been harder to make 1,000-yard, 2,000-yard shots in Vietnam  in the jungle or from a rooftop into a desert?  Oh, I am not claiming my war is any harder than Vietnam, and I give the Vietnam vets all 
[01:25:30]  the props because they definitely fought a harder war, and I give Carlos Halfcock all  the credit as being the greatest sniper to have ever lived.  And you...  And Alex...  That's all I was saying, guys.  Okay, something you said, too, which I thought was a little unfair, but you said that Chris  is bragging about shooting women, and the way you painted that, and we played the audio,  was that here is this guy going over to Iraq, and he's coming back acting like he's hot  shit for killing women, but when Chris described that shoot, he was really specific.  He was bothered by it. 
[01:26:00]  About being bothered?  I read quotes, and in fairness, the media does take things out of context where it's  talking about...  No, you take things out of context, because you made it sound like he was bragging about  shooting women.  But he didn't brag.  When if you listened to the actual interview and not transcripts, you would have heard Chris  Kyle being very bothered by the fact that he shot a woman.  I had time to watch the entire interview.  All I saw was like a three-minute clip on the internet.  No, no, we understand that, but we're saying when you're quoting something and you're painting  this guy, there's a big difference there.  You were painting him as this cavalier ass who was bragging about shooting a woman, and 
[01:26:30]  what he was telling us, Chris, I think, is that you made absolutely sure she had a grenade.  You could see it through your scope.  You were being told, yes, you have to take her out because she's walking towards Marines.  He saved U.S. soldiers' lives, but the way you painted him...  All I'm saying is this.  Even Dallas Morning News said there's something creepy, and I'm not even saying this about Kyle,  about on TV constantly, especially the host and people smacking their lips, and maybe 
[01:27:00]  that's where I'm picking this up.  You guys didn't really do that, but some of the other shows getting all excited, go,  tell us more about killing the people, tell us more, and it's just at a certain point,  it's disgusting, and I don't want to hear about it, and I'm not saying Kyle's even bad  for that.  It's true.  Now that I've seen more of the interviews with him, he's not the one getting off on it.  Some of the hosts are, and I just know all the people I know from Vietnam, World War  II and places will never even talk about it, so I'm just saying, hearing all of this stuff, 
[01:27:30]  I mean, I remember one time I was at the deer camp when I was about 10 years old, where  all these old World War II vets, they're in Buffalo, Texas, just south of Dallas where  we've got a ranch, and Kyle's from that general area, and I'm sitting there pulling on their  leg at 5 a.m. while they're cooking business in gray before we go hunting, tell me a war  story, tell me a war story, tell me a war story.  And one old guy who was a tank commander going into Germany said, okay, there was this woman  who looked like Marilyn Monroe, walked up and opened up her trench coat and pulled out a 
[01:28:00]  rifle, so we cut her in half.  Now there's your story, don't ask me anymore.  I understand that war is ugly, I've got all that stuff.  All I know is, I don't believe that Jesse Ventura said, you deserve to lose a few, unless  he was drunk, and the problem is, Jesse hasn't had alcohol in like 15 years, because of blood  clots, he has to take medicine for blood clots.  And I know Kyle's saying, now that I've seen him on O'Reilly, that he wasn't drinking.  All I know is that the Jesse Ventura I know does not talk about, and the troops, it always 
[01:28:30]  says, I mean, it's a line, you know, he says the same stuff over and over again, that the  troops are heroes, it's not their fault, it's the military, you know, it's the politicians'  fault for failing and sending them there and lying about WMDs.  And so when Chris says that, I mean, and again, right now he sounds like a nice guy, so I'm  completely blown away by this, because Ventura sounds credible, you know, Kyle, you know,  right now sounds calm and nice, and I mean, I don't know what kind of psy-op this is or 
[01:29:00]  what this is, but let me just tell you, it's a big deal.  Well, okay, we do have a problem, because Chris Kyle's saying it happened, and Jesse Ventura  is saying it didn't happen.  Yeah, exactly.  And we heard some audio of you, and you said that you don't even believe Jesse Ventura  was in the bar that day, because he doesn't drink.  Well, yeah, that was probably, like, last Thursday or Friday before I talked to Jesse, and then  Jesse says, yes, I was there for graduation, but I wasn't there speaking. 
[01:29:30]  It was something about numbers that are the same as another class.  Yeah, we heard that part.  So you think Chris Kyle's lying?  I don't believe that Jesse Ventura said you deserve to lose a few names.  No, no, no, all right, fair enough, but do you think Chris Kyle punched Jesse Ventura  and knocked him down?  I told you that when I first was sitting there, you know, they come in during a break when  I was on the radio, like, last Thursday, and they said, have you seen this, you know, from 
[01:30:00]  the O.B. and Anthony show?  And I said, no, scene one.  They said, here it is.  They pulled it up on screen, and I started watching it.  And he says, you know, he was in there talking about the war, blah, blah, blah, and I thought,  oh, well, maybe there was a fight.  And then when he gets to the part about, you know, you deserve to lose a few, I was like,  that's a bunch of bull.  And so that was my initial response, is that I can imagine Jesse Ventura, you know, sometime  making somebody angry, talking bad about the war, and some type of altercation ensuing. 
[01:30:30]  But the part about him saying that, I cannot see that happening.  And now that Jesse denied it, I have to believe Jesse.  And let me tell you, Jesse's so shocked that other Navy SEAL would say something like this,  because he thinks they're all honorable, that, you know, off air, he even said some  of it on air, he's like, my God, Alex, do you think, like, they had a double in there  and this is some type of psy-op?  Now, Chris, is it possible that you and Jesse were arguing or you were debating and he 
[01:31:00]  said something to the effect of, it's only natural you're going to lose a few, or are  you 100% sure that he said it and with the intention that you heard it?  No.  I feel the opinion that he said exactly what I thought he heard.  Some other guys that were standing right there.  Oh, they heard it as well?  And I feel horrible about it coming out the way it had, and I'm sorry I handled it the  way I did on your show.  I guess I should have just denied it and said, I don't know what you're talking about.  And I had no idea, and after all this has come out, I've listened to different interviews 
[01:31:30]  of people trying to, you know, say I'm lying and everything, I had no idea.  Mr. Ventura was trying to, was thinking about public office, doing all this other stuff.  I honestly have no idea who this Pearl guy is.  So, no, I'm not part of some bigger thing trying to discredit him.  And yeah, I feel bad that now all of a sudden all this attention is on this, and I'm trying  to get a story out there about, hey, y'all look at what the troops have to go through  to take notice, and let's take care of these. 
[01:32:00]  Well, can I ask you a question?  Definitely.  You're setting up craft, and you say you're going to have basically diplomatic protection,  training of law enforcement, all these groups.  You've gotten awards from different international groups.  I don't know you'd be here, or I'd pull it up.  And, I mean, have you gone to Israel and gotten police training?  No, sir.  So, you haven't gotten awards from that American-slash-Israel group that trains domestic U.S. police? 
[01:32:30]  Well, I got a Jensa Award, Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs.  That's while I was still active.  That was in 05.  Yeah, well, just so you know, that's Richard Pearl, and he's known as the Prince of Darkness  in the Pentagon.  That's his nickname, but let's just expand on that for a moment.  Do you know about the National Defense Authorization Act and how Congress just abolished the Posse  Comitatus Act?  I mean, you're a master sergeant, isn't it? 
[01:33:00]  No, sir.  I was a chief.  Chief.  Okay, a chief sergeant.  I forget all these different titles and names.  I mean, certainly you know what Posse Comitatus is.  What?  Sir, honestly, as far as when it comes to that, I have my business partners, because  my main concern is running the training side of the business.  I understand.  What is Posse Comitatus?  I don't know what it is.  I'm pretty sure I've caught it twice.  It means no worries for the rest of your days.  Why don't you shut up, Norton, and play the player? 
[01:33:30]  I don't know what Posse Comitatus means.  Okay, that's the 1878 law barring the military from domestic law enforcement.  Oh, okay.  And Kyle, I mean, I'm just curious here.  I mean, this sniper training and stuff, I mean, that's basically paramilitary training  for the police, but I know they've had snipers before that.  I'm just saying, I see a lot of data points here, and I was thinking maybe somebody had,  maybe you had been in an altercation with some big guy who looked like Ventura. 
[01:34:00]  Maybe somebody told you that was Ventura.  Maybe somebody put you up to talking about this, but listening to you now, you sound dumbfounded.  So I'm dumbfounded.  You know, I think that...  Leave the founded part off.  Yeah, yeah.  Is it, Alex?  I mean, is Jesse really that important in the end, that we have to take out Jesse Ventura  and discredit him?  Okay, well, here's why Jesse's really...  It's a question.  I don't know.  Okay, here's something I know isn't true.  100%. 
[01:34:30]  Because I probably talk to Jesse every few weeks or something, or he gives me a call,  ask me about news.  Sorry about that.  Just get Ambien.  But my point is, I talked like two weeks ago.  I called Jesse, and I said, when are you leaving the U.S.?  Are you going to be driving through Texas?  You know, if you are in your RV, stop by my house.  And he's like, well, I think I'm leaving in about a week or so.  And he said, but let me call you in the next few days, and I'll come on the radio before  I leave town.  I said, great.  Say hi to your wife.  Bye.  Next day, phone rings while I'm on air.  Jesse Ventura's got some breaking news.  He wants to come on. 
[01:35:00]  Now, I've just called him in Minnesota, talked to him.  What happened?  You know, his wife got him off the elliptical machine.  I know he's in Minnesota, and it's all over TMZ, Fox News, that Jesse Ventura is rubber  necking, recklessly driving in California trying to get to the airport.  Well, Jesse hasn't flown in 16 months.  Anyway, so Jesse's saying, this is crazy.  I think this is some dirty trick saying, I'm, you know, tailgating, being pulled over  by police.  I'm here in Minnesota.  So he had to threaten TMZ to retract it.  So first, you have that false story come out. 
[01:35:30]  Fox runs with it.  And then this other story comes out.  And I'm telling you, if Jesse is lying, he is a better liar than even Herman Cain.  If he's lying, he's one of the best liars I've ever seen.  So that means you're saying Chris Kyle's lying.  Chris, there's no doubt in your mind that you punched Jesse Ventura that day, right?  Yes, sir.  Definitely.  And Mr. West, you're a friend of Mr. Ventura's.  I'd be more than happy if you would like to set up a time for me and him, not on the air,  me and him, to be able to talk, whether on the phone or in person. 
[01:36:00]  I'll be in California next or this week and Vegas the week after.  I'll be more than happy to sit down, me and him talk, and settle this thing.  Wow, that would be a newsworthy event.  Well, why even make it on the news?  I mean, I'm trying to...  Yeah, Alex, what's wrong with you?  He wants this thing to go away.  I fully, 100% believe I'm telling the truth.  You believe him.  I think him and I could definitely clear the air on this. 
[01:36:30]  Sure.  Well, then I'll tell you what I'll do.  If you can get me your number or your email, I'll give it to Jesse, and I know he's got...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, how about we do it on our show?  Well, no, I mean, I'm not even thinking of on my show.  Whoa, what happened here?  He doesn't want to do it on any show.  How about we do a joint venture, Mr. Alex Jones?  If you want to get them both on together, that's fine.  We bring you Chris Kyle, you bring us Jesse.  Let's do this.  That's fair.  Okay, I just don't think Jesse...  In a cage. 
[01:37:00]  What?  I'm just trying to keep it from the public eye.  Right, right.  Chris doesn't want a three-ring circus.  Hold on, Alex.  What I'm saying is, Chris, do you have audio Skype?  Because the only thing that works from where he's at in the Baja is audio Skype to Skype.  There's no phone lines, nothing.  So I can...  I mean, look, I'll just send Jesse an email, and then I'll see if I can give you his Skype  ID.  I just need some way to give that to Mr. Kyle.  I do not have Skype. 
[01:37:30]  We'll get it done off-air.  You don't want to give it on the air.  We'll do it off-air.  That's easy.  We'll just...  Chris, just stay on hold when we finish and talk to our guy.  One more question for Alex Jones.  I don't see the upside of Chris Kyle telling the story, considering his career in the military  and considering his new business there.  Why would he take this chance and put this crazy lie out there?  Look, all I know is his book was already getting quite a bit of attention, but I mean, he got  like three or four times the attention. 
[01:38:00]  And of course, it did kind of distract in a way, but he did get a ton of attention out of this.  Yeah, it sold a lot of books.  We know that.  But in the end, you know, okay, you sell a lot of books, but you destroy your military  career.  Well, I know this.  That is what's happening, because I've looked at the different SEAL websites and stuff.  They're all mad and saying, even if this is true, and they're all saying they didn't  hear of it happening, and they think they would have, that this makes it look like SEALs  are all talking crap about each other.  And it just makes the SEALs, I mean, even if you believe Ventura said that, it makes 
[01:38:30]  it horrible that he'd say he'd lose some, and it makes it horrible that Chris Kyle would  talk about it.  But I can tell by the way you're talking, Chris is not the way you thought, like you  originally might have interpreted him.  And I think that you're seeing he's a lot more of a real and believable guy.  Yeah, I mean, in the clips I've seen, especially on your show, I mean, he came off as kind  of scripted on O'Reilly, and I see what you're saying, as he probably was nervous and so  was just thinking about what he was going to say, because I mean, I'm in the media so 
[01:39:00]  much, so are you guys, you almost forget you're even on air.  It's like an opposite problem.  You forget you're on air.  I mean, I wish I got butterflies like I did 16 years ago.  And then at the same time, when I saw him on your show, he just seemed kind of like smirky  and arrogant, and you know, like it was real funny.  And now he doesn't sound like that.  So, I mean, it does sound different.  Alex, could you meet Chris maybe a thousand yards south?  South of the Stratosphere Hotel in Vegas?  Yeah, he'll send you a message. 
[01:39:30]  Hey, by the way, I'm from Texas, too, and I've shot a deer at a thousand yards.  I haven't shot an Iraqi at 2,600.  Yeah?  Did the deer have a grenade?  Yeah, but with a deer at a hundred, 308, I could shoot deer at a thousand yards all day  long.  You're all man, Alex.  Well, I'm not a Bronco rider.  I mean, I didn't do it professionally like Kyle, but I have, I did work for a large animal  vet for a couple years, and I've, so I've, I've run the electric dehorners and the hot  shots, and I've inoculated a thousand cows in one day. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  I think we're good, but we appreciate you guys.  Tiny cow arms.  Laying that.  We appreciate you both coming on, and Chris, we'll talk to you off air for a second.  Yeah, we're in a quandary, sir.  I believe Chris.  I believe Chris.  I think that, yeah, look, they had a good discussion, and Chris explained himself, and  all right, fair enough.  And Alex, officially, you believe Jesse?  Folks, folks should go to Infowars.com or PritcherPlan.com and watch the full interview  at Infowars.com and see who you believe.  Yes, I believe Jesse, but here's the deal, Chris. 
[01:40:30]  I guess I can contact your publisher and try to get your contact so I can put you in touch  with Jesse?  Definitely.  Okay, well then, I'll just tell your publisher to, who should I contact with the publisher?  William Morrow.  No, no, but they're going to be getting so many calls.  Wait, do it off air because you're going to have a bunch of names flying around?  Yeah.  We'll get it to you off air, the real name from Chris.  Yeah.  I think it might be Ted Sheckler.  Yeah.  Well, whatever we do, we need to be in the situation, because I don't, I mean, this is 
[01:41:00]  definitely turning into a mess.  All right, we'll get it figured out.  Yeah, we do it all together, though.  We do it all together.  Nice.  Alex, thank you for coming on.  You bet, thank you.  Take care, buddy.  All right, Alex.  Chris, enjoy the boneyard, all right?  Yes, I appreciate that.  And Chris, if you're not going to be in Phoenix January 27th and 28th when I'm working in  Tempe, I meant to say Tempe at the Improv, talk to our guy off the air and give him your  info.  And if he's not going to be in Cleveland, because I'll be at the Improv that weekend, then  he can come to that show.  Love the plugs.  Chris, wow, you created a lot of talk there, sir. 
[01:41:30]  Yes, man.  Thank you for coming on today.  Yeah, thanks for having me, guys.  I don't see why you would lie about this one.  I don't either.  No, no doubt.  Yeah, so one of these guys coming forward, you think?  The witnesses?  They're starting to now.  They're already talking to other people, getting it all set up, and they're getting them all  together.  Can we help in that way, or how are you guys going to do it?  Because you've got to get it to the media somehow.  That's what we're trying to figure out, the best way to do this. 
[01:42:00]  That way, I'm trying to avoid a three-ring circus.  I'm trying not to defame Mr. Ventura.  I'm kind of trying to knock the legs out from him.  I'm just trying to get all the guys together.  I gave them the contact person of who they need to get a hold of and give their story.  And then trying to figure out the best way to come out with this so it doesn't look like  this thing continues on, and we're just here to bash him. 
[01:42:30]  We just want this thing to end and go away.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you, Chris.  We appreciate you calling in today.  Take care, buddy.  We'll talk to you off air.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Chris, Kyle, I'm putting you on hold.  Hold on.  Wow.  That's good.  That's cool.  I think Alex, hearing him talk, knows that this guy is not a bullshitter.  He ain't going to throw his friend under the bus, but you can listen to Chris Kyle  Yeah, he's in one of those positions where he can't throw his friend under the bus.  You hear that, Alex?  Yes, I'm sitting here.  You heard that, right? 
[01:43:00]  You now believe Chris Kyle after you heard him on our show.  Well, I think you know he's more believable.  No, I think, listen.  Where'd he go?  Oh, no.  In the first interview, he seems concerned.  Hello?  Situation.  I just think this whole thing.  Hello?  Yeah?  Am I even on air?  Because I hear the phone going on and off here. 
[01:43:30]  Are you clicking off?  Because I'm hearing half what you're saying.  Yeah, get a better phone.  It's not our problem.  No, I'm sitting right here.  It's PSYOPs.  So I'm sitting right here.  PSYOPs is going on.  They don't want what you have to say on the air for some reason.  No, I don't think that's what's happening when I sit.  I don't think that's what's happening.  Who gives us a proper response?  No, I don't think that's what's happening.  I don't think.  Au contraire.  All right, Alex.  Enjoy your day.  All right, Alex.  I believe Jesse Ventura and it's all going to come out. 
[01:44:00]  My name is E-Rock hosting this thing.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  If you want to say hi or block me, either one is fine.  Our old friend, longtime friend, Jim Brewer.  Every time this guy is on the show, it is gold.  He's got amazing stories.  He's got a million stories that we've never heard.  He has a million stories that he's told us already.  This is one of them about when he rented a house, had his whole family, a bunch of friends come down.  I believe it was on the Outer Banks.  He rented this house, had a big party, and somebody did something and burnt the place down. 
[01:44:30]  I can't really do this story justice.  Jim Brewer is here.  He will tell you everything.  He's at Jim Brewer on Twitter.  So if you want to say hi, feel free to do so on the Worst of 2012.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012.  That house burning down story from the Outer Banks.  That was great.  I almost burnt down the entire Outer Banks.  Oh, man.  Do you mind?  Not at all.  Because I was howling. 
[01:45:00]  This is great Long Island, South Shore, white trash heading to another state and haven't been out in a while.  So every year, for like two years in a row, I would rent two houses down on the Outer Banks.  And I'd rent it so far.  I'd rent it as far north as possible.  So you have to go on the Outer Banks and then drive on the beach.  The 4x4 beach.  The 4x4.  That's where I get my house every summer.  Because I have so many heavy drinkers in my family, I didn't need them driving around in North Carolina all night. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  So we would go at the far north end of the beach where the fence was to get into Virginia.  It's at the actual border.  Right there.  I was at the border.  So I have two houses and there's nobody near me.  So they get as loud as they want.  Matter of fact, the first night, now we had the kid house.  And we have the do whatever you want house. 
[01:46:00]  Of all people, everyone in the do whatever you want house is usually 50 and over.  Right.  They don't even get off there.  I don't think any of my sisters saw the beach that week.  Oh, really?  I swear to God.  The beach is literally right in front of you.  It's 40 yards.  It's in front.  It's wild horses there.  Both my sisters never even stood up.  They just yearned, cut a urine hole in a bench, peed, drank jugs of wine, smoked 4,000. 
[01:46:30]  My one sister's married to the big, thick German.  He'd start drinking Heineken at the night with the eggs.  And so the first night we go to bed and it's like 11 o'clock at night.  And for down there, that's about 4 a.m.  11 o'clock at night is 4 a.m.  Because you start early, you drink all day, you go swimming, you see dolphins, horses. 
[01:47:00]  It's a big, long day.  So at the end of the night, I hear this music.  What is going on?  I look in the next house and there's these guys playing guitar.  I know no one in my family plays instruments.  Who's at their house playing guitars?  These fucking yo-yos were so loud.  The locals were like, hey man, someone's having a big party.  And they came out of the woods.  Now you gotta see the locals down there. 
[01:47:30]  Oh man.  This is where convicts live.  The houses right next to the ocean are fucking beautiful.  Elevators, pools, you name it.  But you go in the backwoods, which is right there toward the Bay Area.  It's fucking...  They're convicts.  I'm convinced they're like making moonshine, crystal meth, and all sorts of shit back there.  And there's slavery still going on deep in the woods there.  Without a doubt, hands down.  Something's going on.  So anyway, before we...  It's locals.  It's just partying our brains off. 
[01:48:00]  Now, before we get there, I usually rent a week with my family.  And then a week before that, I get my friends from Long Island.  So why don't we go there, before my family comes.  Now it's 4th of July week.  So as we're going down, we stop in Virginia.  Oh yeah.  And I think we must have dropped, I'm not even exaggerating, probably $1,000.  That's a lot.  Easy.  For south of the border.  Easy.  $1,000 in fireworks.  Fuck.  Now, we get to North Carolina. 
[01:48:30]  We're all hopped up for...  We haven't had a display like this since 1978's Black Party.  Jefferson Avenue.  The big fire walk off.  This was a huge event.  There's no trees to interrupt.  This is great.  Perfect.  Now, whenever you get down there...  Have you ever been down there 4th of July?  No.  No, I always go in August.  It's better than the Hudson River.  Yeah.  And it's all local shooting these things all over the water. 
[01:49:00]  So it clearly says everywhere, don't even...  Every sign, every try, don't even...  Listen.  Don't even think about shooting your goddamn fireworks off.  We will arrest you.  It is a federal offense.  Don't shoot your goddamn fireworks off down here.  And they must stay on the ground.  No aerials.  Well, of course, now we start, we wait for night.  We can't even wait for night. 
[01:49:30]  Now, we figured before...  Now, we were afraid of getting caught, so we went on the local street.  Now, the local street on the beach is all sand.  So it's impossible...  If someone called the cops on you, it's going to take 20 minutes for them to show up.  Okay.  So we got this plan.  And there's no way anyone's going to catch us.  This is going to be phenomenal.  So we go in front of the house, where it's just all sand. 
[01:50:00]  There's no real roads.  And we're lighting off the fireworks.  And we're having a fucking hook.  Of course you are.  It's great.  Beyond...  We're wasted on wine.  We're blasted shots.  We're having a great time.  Bringing back the buzz of 79.  The buzz of 79.  We're going back to 1979 in Rosedale.  Behind the bowling alley.  It's the great buzz of 79. 
[01:50:30]  We haven't had this much fun.  Stole wine calling from the Chinamen.  So we're hooting it up.  We're shooting on fireworks.  Can't believe how great this is now.  Great time, yeah.  We're like, let's save some for the...  Let's save the biggie biggies for the beach.  So, we take them all up.  And we leave them in...  We basically just cover them.  Now the wives come.  Mostly mine.  And she's like, you can't leave the fireworks out and trash down on the street. 
[01:51:00]  You should put them in the garbage.  Put them in the garbage, but they're hot.  We don't want to put them in...  Well, just put sand in them.  Oh, no.  So we take the firework garbage.  We put them in the garbage pails.  And we throw some sand on them.  We're buzzed, so it's probably not as much as we should have.  So now we head to the...  Now we go to the beach side.  And we're lighting the big ones off. 
[01:51:30]  The ones where you need the pipes and tubes and shit.  Sure enough.  I love those.  What a great sound that is.  It's great, man.  Holy shit!  Umbrella!  Umbrella!  That one looked like it was going to land on us, man.  That's like army shit.  That's right.  It echoes down the beach.  Oh, yeah.  So we see the cops coming. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, shit.  But again, it's like ocean water.  They're so far down the beach.  We're watching them as we're hiding the fireworks.  And we're taking the fireworks and we're putting them under the stairs.  There's little stairs that lead to your house.  We're putting them under there.  And we're burying some.  We're throwing others in the garbage.  We still see them coming.  Sure enough.  And we figured, eh, we'll pretend we're caught with some fireworks. 
[01:52:30]  You know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he stops.  And he goes, all right, I need an ID from all of you.  So, whatever.  We're taking out the ID.  And he goes, now, I'll have you know, you're going to tell me where the fireworks are, because  I clearly saw you lighting them up, or I'm taking each and every one of you to jail.  I instantly panic.  And I'm like, listen, man. 
[01:53:00]  And before I can even finish my sentence, I have to say, my friend Larry, he works at  FedEx.  He's blue collar.  He's like, listen, bro.  I don't know what you're looking for, but where you got it?  You're coming up negative here, bro.  You're coming up here negative.  You got nothing right here.  You might as well put your pen away, because you ain't writing a report.  I don't know what to say.  It's so we all know that guy.  I know that guy.  We all know that guy. 
[01:53:30]  I know that guy.  And he's got his own sayings.  He's telling the guy, he's like, bro, negative.  I don't know what to tell you.  You're coming up negative.  Put the pen away.  You got no reports to fill in.  I don't know what to tell you, bro.  So, he's sitting there, but he's not buckling under.  The cop goes, if I'm going to start searching right now, he goes, bro, do what you got  to do.  Bring the dogs.  Do what you got to do.  Do what you got to do.  We're right here.  If I add your ex-puzzle.  Right here.  Yeah, it's possible, bro.  Oh, shit.  So, the cop starts looking around.  My heart's good. 
[01:54:00]  Now, we're all looking in areas.  Oh, fuck.  He's asking us, where are we staying?  He's like, bro, I was just visiting.  About six hours down.  We're not telling him we're staying right here.  All right.  So, he starts looking around.  We're all figuring out where we're going to dart and how.  If he sees one.  Because if he sees one, there's six of us.  He's fat.  There's no way he's going to outrun us in the sand.  Can I ask you how long ago this was?  I'm going to say five years, Tops.  So, you're well into adulthood here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  This is a story.  You're doing your 19, Jim.  I've got three kids sleeping in the house.  I've got my baby sleeping in the house.  Of course, okay.  Just wanted to know.  So, with that, he finally drives away.  He's like, I'm telling him if I catch you, I'm going to find out what house you're in.  He's like, bro, I'll clean here.  We're all clean.  We just told you we're all clean. 
[01:55:00]  We're not like that.  So, he drives away.  Now, we're laughing.  We're enjoying how we just got out of it.  Got out of the southern police.  Now, the homes there have three layers.  It's literally like a Tony Montana house.  They're just gorgeous.  And we're looking over the beach.  Now, my blue-collar friend Larry, his wife was pregnant.  Thank God.  There's a reason why I say she's pregnant. 
[01:55:30]  We're all winding it up, buzzed, joy in life.  She comes out of the house.  She goes, I'm really tired.  My feet are swollen.  I'm getting cramps.  My back hurts.  I'm going to bed.  All right.  Good night.  Good night.  She comes back out about three minutes later, very calmly.  Guys, there's a really, really bad fire in the front of the house.  Oh, shit.  Really, really bad fire. 
[01:56:00]  But that's how she said it.  And, of course, we're like, yeah.  My one friend's got the, you know, hey, hey, hey, hey.  He's got the pipe.  It's great.  The fire helps the earth and the water.  So, she goes back in.  She goes, no.  Guys, you really have to do something about this fire.  And she's holding her belly while she's saying this.  She goes, it's a bad fire.  I'm not kidding.  So, as she says that, I swear to God, in, like, slow motion, I just kind of look up. 
[01:56:30]  And as I'm getting up, I see a glare coming over the top of the house.  Oh, shit.  And I get up.  Now, this is from the third level of the house.  And I turn, and through the living room and through the kitchen window, I could see the top of a flame.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  And I'm looking.  That's 20 feet high.  Easy.  Easy.  And I'm looking.  20 foot flames.  Easy.  And we all go right in the front.  Yeah.  And you see.  Oh, no.  This fucking thing's about 20 feet high and 8 to 10 feet wide. 
[01:57:00]  And it's in the front of the house.  Oh, my God.  Now, it's August, so everything is literally like a matchstick.  Everything can burn.  There's no.  So, we go running outside.  Now, we go running outside.  We're literally like dogs.  We're trying to throw the sand on the thing.  Like, you got that section.  And we're taking our shoes, and we're scooping sand up and throwing it all over. 
[01:57:30]  The girls are taking buckets, and they're running to the pool and coming back with buckets.  Bucket brigade.  They got to remember, too.  Oh, this is in the sand.  So, when you run the house, it's a good 100 feet.  Oh, shit.  So, by the time they come back, the bucket's half full.  They're out of breath.  They need help to come and get them for the relay race.  Now, the locals are out there, and they're like, you better call the fire department.  It's going to spread to the rest of the island.  And as they're saying that, you literally, I swear to God, you'd see one little spark come floating off the tree. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, man.  And go maybe, like, eight feet.  And the minute it lands, it looks...  Start up.  And this thing's heading for the next house, and it's heading for our cars.  So, I'm going to say we got it about 60% under control.  60%? 
[01:58:30]  You're a little fired about it.  Yeah, we got about 60% under control.  We're hoping by the end of the day we can really get a bite onto this thing.  60%.  Oh, man.  So, I'm all worried about the cars.  We start getting the cars, and we're moving the cars so the cars don't blow up, but it's heading for the other house.  That's what I'm starting to freak out about.  Oh, man.  And so, now we got a hose.  Another guy comes out with a hose.  We'll hose it down.  65% under control now. 
[01:59:00]  The fire department comes.  They put it out really quick.  We have to fill out a report.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Now, that same day, all right, earlier that day, we started cooking.  I forgot about this.  As we were cooking, now, their gas stoves are on the top deck.  So, you know, cooking burgers and blah, blah, blah, and we're in the kitchen.  We turn around.  The deck, the top deck is on fire.  The barbecue had so much grease in it, it went on fire. 
[01:59:30]  It lit part of the deck.  The deck is syringe.  So, we have this situation, and we have the whole front.  Now, the next morning, we get up, and they had a row of trees and bushes, just all brown  or gone.  I mean, it's black, brown, and gone.  Where we had the garbage pails. 
[02:00:00]  They completely disintegrated.  So, three fires now.  Right.  So, they completely disintegrated.  No, well.  Two fires.  Two fires.  That's from the fireworks that they put in the garbage pails.  So, now, we're panicking, going, you know, the real estate agent is going to come here.  It's fucking...  Well, sure enough, who comes pulling in the driveway?  Oh, my God.  This guy pulls in the driveway, and it says... 
[02:00:30]  I don't want to say the travel agency.  I haven't been back since.  I don't know.  They pull up.  The guy gets out, and he's...  Before he gets out, he's in the car.  And I'm going, oh, my God.  He's just looking at all the damage.  We're in a lot of trouble.  This is really bad.  He's been in the car for, like, ten minutes.  He gets out of the car.  He looks at the direction of all the bushes where the garbage pails used to be. 
[02:01:00]  He comes walking up the stairs.  I open the door, and he goes, hello, I'm from the agency.  I'm going, I know, I know, I know.  This is bad.  He goes, I apologize.  I go, you apologize?  He goes, I would have got here sooner, because I'm here about the kitchen drawer.  Your wife called the kitchen drawers jammed.  So I'm looking at him, like, all awkward.  And I'm not sure if he's toying with me. 
[02:01:30]  Right, right, right.  So I said, yeah.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Yeah, let me show you that.  We're paying good money for this house.  I'm paying really good.  You know, I've got family here.  I can't cook a meal.  It's stuck.  I can't cook a meal without lighting everything on fire, apparently.  So he fixes the drawer.  And before he leaves, I go, listen, just want to let you know, the barbecue went on fire. 
[02:02:00]  And he looks at you.  Well, this happens all the time.  It's not your fault.  I said, yeah, the cleaner should have done something with the grease or something.  It's no problem.  He goes, is there anything else?  I go, no, sir.  He goes back in the car and he leaves.  So now we know, all right, here's what we got to do.  We go to town.  We bought all new garbage pails and green spray paint.  And we spray painted all the bushes and the tree. 
[02:02:30]  I swear to God, green and brown, everything.  It had no leaves and nothing, but we painted it all.  And we had brown and we were spray paint in the sand.  And we spray painted everything as if it was back to normal.  And we never, but we came that close to burning down all the outer banks, man.  Dude, that's fucking insane.  Three separate fires.  Dude, it was bad news.  That one that was, the one in the front when the firemen came. 
[02:03:00]  What was actually burning in the front?  What happened was the fireworks in the garbage pail started a fire in the garbage pail.  Oh, shit.  And then that thing completely disintegrated and they put it on crates, wooden crates.  Oh, so that shit went up.  So then the crate went up and then that lit up the bushes and the trees and everything else.  And once the embers start going, it's over.  And this had to have been a period of a good two and a half hours.  Wow.  Between putting those fireworks in there and then going and catching another buzz and dealing 
[02:03:30]  with the cops and then sitting and relaxing and enjoying the night.  All that shit and everything just brewing.  Right.  The fire's just fucking percolating.  Yeah, well, you guys go enjoy the front.  We're going to percolate here, your friend.  We're going to wait for the perfect opportunity to just burst into flames.  Wow, man.  Thank God somebody saw it because you motherfuckers just partying with the place.  If she wasn't pregnant.  Yeah.  And she would have been down there. 
[02:04:00]  To go to bed.  To go to bed, right.  That place would have been lit up.  And I would have been in the news for the wrong reasons.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know, bro.  Comedian Jim Brewer, currently involved in a huge fire, formerly goat mo-  No, he's right.  It would have been like, half-baked sets of baking blaze.  That's it.  Perfect.  A full-baked, fully-baked blaze in North Carolina by the I'm Not High Jim Brewer. 
[02:04:30]  That's good.  Arsonist Jim Brewer.  O.P. Anthony's worst of 2012.  12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12.  Continues right now.  Hey, it's E-Rock, hosting the worst of 2012.  Shaquille O'Neal is in studio.  What's to say about Shaquille O'Neal?  Done a million things.  You may know him best from his movie Kazam, or perhaps Steel, or Blue Chips, or some of  the other movies that he's been in that they're too long to list. 
[02:05:00]  Perhaps you know him from his Shaq-Fu video game.  Maybe you played that growing up, or rapping with the Fushnickens to What's Up, Doc?  Or maybe you know him as just one of the greatest basketball players that there ever was.  Anyway, he's in studio, and he's not talking about any of that.  He's promoting soap.  This is O.P. Anthony's worst of 2012.  Shaq's here early?  Holy shit.  That must be him. 
[02:05:30]  Oh yeah, bring him in.  God.  I'll see if he's ready.  Yes.  Like his head is...  He would hit the exit sign, it looks like.  Wow, he's massive.  That must be a bitch to fucking go around like that.  I guess we'll jump back on this at some juncture today.  Yeah, of course.  I think we should finish it with him right here.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Of course we'll finish it.  So...  He played in Miami.  Your Dove body wash.  I know.  It's a weird day to be promoting Dove.  You and your Dove body wash.  Don't talk about basketball, I just want to talk about my body wash.  The publicist says, I just can talk about my body wash. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, we gotta save Kareem Abdul-Jabbar from his publicist.  Poor bastard.  Shaq is making his way down the hall.  Yes, he is.  Fuck, he's a legend.  He's driving toward the window.  One of the greatest NBA players of all fucking time.  Yes.  Some say the greatest center of all time.  Oh my God.  I'd still give it to Abdul-Jabbar.  He is so fucking...  Oh my God.  He can't...  Look, he ducked under the exit sign, dude.  I'm not even fucking kidding. 
[02:06:30]  I see that.  Look at that exit sign right there.  He has to duck under it.  Oh, he's got those cool headphones, too.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  I know Travis.  He's very tall.  Yes, we know who he is.  We understand.  Oh, I like how quiet we get before.  Well, you know, you want to be actually...  I'm a little nervous.  Are you really?  Oh.  Sometimes I get nervous with these things.  Sweetie.  I love basketball.  Oh my God.  God, he's so tall.  Damn, man.  Holy shit.  That's craziness.  I'm going to be starstruck when he sees me.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Well, of course.  It's you, Jimmy.  Yeah, well...  Does he know you, you think?  No.  Well, no.  No?  No.  He's got to duck his head to get through that door.  Yeah.  This is going to be crazy.  Yeah.  I love his headphones.  What are they?  Love the headphones.  Huh?  Are they beats?  Yes.  Are they beats, yo?  I prefer bows.  Yeah, yeah.  This is going to get ugly.  You can just walk right in.  Bring him right in.  We're pretty frigging loose when it comes to actually doing a show. 
[02:07:30]  How you doing, man?  How you doing, man?  Anthony, how you doing, man?  That's...  Hey, Shaq.  Pleasure, man.  How you doing?  I like the beats you had on.  Very good.  You know this guy?  I know everybody.  Yeah?  I know everybody.  Jimmy Norton?  We've actually never met.  No?  No.  But Shaq has helped some comedians, so I'm certainly hoping that you're up for helping  some more.  We made Kevin Hart famous.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Jimmy knows Kevin Hart real well.  Yeah, we kind of came up together.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Even though I'm a lot older than him and he shot past me, but I'm happy for him.  It's always good to see a friend shoot by you.  What got you involved in the roast?  Like, did you want to be roasted or are you just a fan of comedy?  Well, I'm a fan of comedy and I saw it was a big void in comedy, so I just made all  the comedians' offers they couldn't refuse.  Oh, good money and TV.  Exactly.  Did anybody say no to that?  No.  That's kind of what they said.  Why would they say no to that?  That sounds like a great fucking opportunity.  Were you sensitive about any of it?  Like, was there anything with you?  No.  I mean, I probably have the greatest sense of humor ever. 
[02:08:30]  I like to laugh.  I like to make people laugh.  And, you know, like I said, it was a void there and nobody was really doing it.  But Russell was doing it first and then, you know, I turned on HBO and it's not there  anymore.  So, I tried it at an All-Star game.  Because, you know, at All-Star events, everybody's there.  So, I said, let's do it at an All-Star game.  And, my partner, Jeff Clannigan and I, we did it and it was such a success. 
[02:09:00]  He was like, you know what?  This can't be true.  Let's do it again.  And, we did it again.  And, we recorded it.  I said, let's sell it and see how people like it.  And, we sell over 400,000 copies every time we get that drop.  Oh, my God.  That's awesome.  And, none of it made you go like, ugh.  No.  Ugh.  No.  Because, you know, I like to laugh.  And, you know, it would be like coming up here and telling you guys what to say and  how to say it.  That's what the bosses do.  Yeah.  That's their job.  Obviously, they don't. 
[02:09:30]  Because, you guys are one of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Oh, thank you very much.  That's a promo.  Yeah, Roland probably said that on the way in.  Just tell them they're popular.  They'll be really good to you.  That's why we like it here.  Because, they don't bother us as far as that shit goes on.  For the most part.  Hey, we're all smelling like your Dove products.  We have to say it.  They gave it to us last week.  Yeah, we honestly, at first, didn't even know why they were bringing in the products.  And, we're like, oh, wow, this is good.  Yeah.  And, then I started seeing the commercials.  And, we've been using the body wash.  That's why you're here for the most part, right?  Well, obviously, you guys have always been comfortable in your own skin. 
[02:10:00]  And, you know, it's a great product.  I've been using it even before we joined the strategic partnership.  But, you know, I thought it was a great commercial.  You know, my mom came by the house to check on me.  And, I was like, you've got to be in this commercial with me.  And, it's a great commercial.  And, you know, the Dove men's care product is a great line.  You know, especially the body wash.  I actually like the size and the price.  Yeah.  Because, I'm a guy who like to keep my stuff clean. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  During the day.  It is a big size, too, man.  But, it smells good.  It's like the deodorant is actually really fresh.  Yeah.  And, I put it on, and I'm very pleased with myself.  Ah, you should be.  Yeah, we were hoping you would notice that we smell like your product.  Yeah, but it's just kind of awkward to fucking lean in and smell me.  Right.  You get a lot of endorsements, which is great.  I mean, you're kind of, you're one of the sports stars that have really done well as far as endorsements.  Give me a meal, Shaq.  Not you.  We're waiting for our first endorsement. 
[02:11:00]  Well, yeah.  I mean, I've taken care of business since I came in.  And, you know, whenever I meet with a company, I always tell them, I'm not really interested in endorsement, but, you know, in a strategic partnership.  And, I've also been the type that, if I'm not comfortable with the product, or if I've never used your product, then I'll be an honest businessman and not take your money.  Have you ever worried about things that you say?  Because you've said some controversial, albeit funny, but some people see it as controversial. 
[02:11:30]  Not at all.  Yeah?  Because, to me, image is reality.  Yeah.  Those that come in with the suits and create their image, they're the ones that have to watch out.  So you figure there's nothing they can get you on where you can fall because you're going to say it.  Okay, this is me.  No, not really.  You know, people see me, they know that I'm a humble guy, they know that I'm a funny guy, they know I'm always saying what's on my mind.  You've got some great quotes, too, man.  Thank you.  Some people would say they should use that soap to wash your mouth out with Mr. Rubio.  No way.  I'm a role model. 
[02:12:00]  No way.  Your Kobe quote to this day makes me howl, man.  I don't know what you're talking about.  He don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just saying, man, it makes me fucking howl.  Yeah, everybody was laughing.  But it's refreshing to see guys say what's on their mind.  Guys like Barkley always talked.  And it's like, I don't want to hear somebody giving the company line.  That's not interesting to me.  And then, you know what, being a marketing expert, I know what's going to get everybody riled up.  Right.  Like, I know when to say it and how to say it.  That incident, I was at one of those little comedy clubs. 
[02:12:30]  They called you up on stage and I did a little rap and somebody recorded it and sold it for $500.  You know, they tried to make a big deal out of it.  Yeah.  That was at Gnome's Place down in the village.  Was it the Fat Black Pussycat, I think?  It was one of those because the comedy show was right around the corner.  It was like one of those little underground clubs.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe the village underground.  But you know what?  The funny thing is when this stuff gets out, everybody talks about it like you're going  to get a spanking.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you see what Chuck said today?  It's true.  Yeah.  That's kind of the society we're living in these days, though, where everybody's walking on eggshells. 
[02:13:00]  Well, what I respect about it, he didn't apologize.  No, no.  He just let it happen and just went with it.  Because, you know, I was at a comedy club.  I was at a setting.  Right.  Context.  And I know I rocked the crowd.  It was about 500 people having a good time.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's just, you know, people use that to, you know, create their show.  I just love that.  I understand.  As a sports fan, you know, I understand you guys got to have sportsmanship to a point.  But it gets sickening after a while.  I like when you guys are real about losses and certain plays and players. 
[02:13:30]  Everyone knows that I'm a little comedian.  Those that can't take it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Better sense of humor.  Buy one.  Yeah.  They're on the internet.  $4.99.  Senseofhumor.com.  Well, you're one of those big guys, too.  It was interesting to read that when you were coming up that you would always try to  make people laugh and be the funny guy.  Like, you were either the funny guy or the bully.  Like, you were either going to get big laughs from somebody or they were going to go home  with the fucking jaw shattered.  So you had, like, two options.  Which I think was interesting. 
[02:14:00]  When you'd move to a new place, you would just try to make people laugh first before  you would try to dominate them another way.  Yeah, because, I mean, I'm a really funny, sensitive guy.  And I never wanted to have to fight.  But when they used to say Shaquilla and Sasquatch, that's it.  I'm kicking your ass right now.  Three o'clock.  Who the hell would say that to you?  A lot of people.  Wow.  How dumb do you have to be?  Yeah, at what point does that stop?  I had to bust a lot of heads.  Well, it stopped, like, after the first couple weeks when I got there.  You know, because, you know, it's just like, you know, those jail movies, you get there 
[02:14:30]  and you find out who the toughest kid is.  Right.  I was like, this guy right here with the ponytail in the back?  This chick right here.  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm going to kill this guy.  So, you see him at three and you steal on him and you beat him up in front of everybody  and then the next day you get major respect.  Right.  It probably bothers you.  Yeah.  I wouldn't know about anything like that.  No.  I miss Shaq in the NBA because, you know, there's not a lot of personality right now.  Not a lot of guys stepping up and just being, you know, personable and saying some crazy  stuff. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  At all.  Who would you say is in the league that?  Nobody.  Really, right?  It's different.  I mean, LeBron is a bore when he's not playing.  I always tell my kids that, you know, when I was coming up, the league was more fabulous  than it is now.  Right.  Every team, even the bad teams.  Just think about, like, in the 80s, even a team like Denver, Alex English.  You know, every team had a great player.  Right.  Anybody ever tell you you look like Boomer Esiason?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boomer.  I went to school with Boomer back in. 
[02:15:30]  Anthony had a fight with Boomer Esiason.  Fifth grade.  I punched him in the forehead and broke my arm.  A dick-headed motherfucker.  I looked like a dick-headed.  Yeah.  Anthony punched him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Broke both fucking arms.  Broke my arm.  Both bones in your right arm.  I've done, like, golf tournaments with him, though, after that.  So he's cool.  I like Boomer.  He's a fun guy.  Yeah.  He's all right.  He's a good guy.  You're very business savvy, obviously.  When did that start?  Like, you're going for the sport part of it.  You're good at basketball.  You know, that's going to be part of it.  When do you start to realize that that's necessary? 
[02:16:00]  One day, I was on punishment.  And my father came in and he hit me in the head with a book.  And he said, if you ever start being a leader and a follower, you could become somebody.  So anyway, I read the book.  And the book was about Kareem and how he lost everything.  So one of my fears as an athlete or as a professional person was losing everything.  So he invested in soybeans, Kareem, right?  That was a big loss for him.  We had Kareem in here and we weren't really allowed to ask him any basketball questions. 
[02:16:30]  He had a publicist.  We felt sorry for Kareem Abdul-Jawar, believe it or not.  He was having a great time, but afterwards, he wasn't too thrilled that we talked about basketball as well as the book.  And we didn't even get to ask him about that.  Get his personality.  He lost it all, what, back in the 70s?  Yeah, soybeans and everything.  That investment, wow.  It was always one of my fears coming up.  And those guys didn't make as much money back then.  So the investing was important.  When I first came in, I was making a lot of money. 
[02:17:00]  I think my first year, I didn't make a lot.  I don't want to say the number, but it was a lot.  It would probably depress the listeners.  I mean, we understand that kind of money.  So then another time, I was in the arena.  Hey, buddy.  The dude scared me.  Oh, Iraqi.  Yeah.  It's like looking at an animal behind a glass wall, isn't it?  He's very athletic as he chews something there.  So then I met Magic Johnson.  Magic Johnson told me, you know, he grabbed him by the arm and he's like,  it's good to be the man, but you want to start owning stuff.  And I was like, what the hell is Magic talking about? 
[02:17:30]  But then as I played in L.A. and I saw the stuff he was doing  in the community and development, I was like, you know what?  Let me do that.  And while I'm doing it, let me go back and get my master's.  Because when I have conversations with people,  of course they're going to look at me as Shaq,  but I want them to know that I understand.  When I go in with CEOs and they know I got my master's in business,  they know that they can't let anything start.  They can't mess with you.  No coin, no nothing.  And now I'm getting my Ph.D. May 5th in HRD. 
[02:18:00]  Dr. Shaquille?  Dr. Shaquille on you?  Yes, Dr. O'Neill.  What's HRD?  Human Resource Development.  So how do you find, this is the scary part for me,  is because most guys you get a business manager  and it's scary to find somebody that you can trust  who you know isn't going to rip you off.  Like, do you just go on, I check my stuff all the time  and there's not much to check,  but I'm obsessed with the idea that somebody's just,  I'm going to just have to see zeros one time.  Steal his money and make it to Newark.  Well, you have to, you have to like, you know, trust people.  Like when I came in, I interviewed the top four firms 
[02:18:30]  and three of them even said in like, you know, Kareem's book,  like if it's too good to be true, stay away from them.  So one guy came in, A, I noticed you made this much,  we can double it and triple it, he's out.  Another guy, we'll do this and we'll do that, he's out.  And I met a little guy, a little Jewish guy,  I said, hey, I can put it in savings bonds  and get you some annuities and I can manage your money  and make sure I was like, I like that guy.  Yeah, we got the little Jewish guy too.  Yeah, you got to go.  You got to go.  Hashim, Shalom, Shalom. 
[02:19:00]  You got to go a little Jewish guy every time.  You just have to.  You got it.  You just got it.  That's very smart.  I'm telling you it's smart.  Because as far as being an athlete goes,  you never really know when that machine is just going to stop working  as far as that.  And, you know, you could have a long, illustrious career,  make a lot of money, or you could be done in a year.  Yeah, you could be done in a year.  Like when I first came in and my agent told me  I was going to be making this much, I'm like, seriously?  But, I mean, in the real world, when you're done playing, 
[02:19:30]  there's no way you're going to make that much.  No way.  Right.  So you got to know where to.  Unless you get one of them Google, Facebook, IPOs.  And there's no way.  So you got to save it or you got to make it work.  What do you think the difference is between somebody like you  that actually realized that and people that just decide  they're going to kind of play it with it?  Fear, you think?  Yeah, fear.  Was that from your stepfather, you think?  Like kind of drilling it into you?  Yeah, stepfather, just being fear and just, you know,  not, you know, just being able to live the same lifestyle. 
[02:20:00]  Like, you know, for a guy that doesn't have any business savvy,  the only word he should memorize is annuity.  Yeah.  Put money away and then at a certain age,  you get to take it out for the rest of your life.  That's it.  No investments, no buying businesses,  no trying to do restaurants, just annuity.  And that was the first thing I did.  It'll be there when you're, you know, ready to relax.  Is that annuity is money that you don't get taxed on  and then you can't, I like it, I sound like I'm saying it, 
[02:20:30]  but I'm really asking.  It's tax deferred.  Tax deferred until you take it out.  Tax deferred until you defer that shit.  And then sometimes you get a lower tax rate based on.  I met a guy one time, he had a hundred dollar bill  and he ripped it in half and he said,  you put that 50 away and annuity you never touch,  you got 50 left.  Now the smart ones that rip that 50 in half  and you save 75 and you play with 25.  And that's what I tried to do.  But Chuck, you can't spend half the bill.  Well, he was just trying to.  Smart guy.  I've never wanted to see a fist fly in front of me so bad. 
[02:21:00]  Shaq, you know a few guys that were pretty,  pretty big stars in the NBA that are broke.  I don't know if you want to mention names.  They say they're broke.  I don't really know their finances.  Yeah, there's a few guys off the top of my head  that didn't do a lot of the stuff you're saying  and they are in a desperate situation right now.  No, like I said earlier, because of fear,  I never wanted to be in that position.  Like I never, you know, first thing I did 
[02:21:30]  was buy my mom and parents a house.  Like I said to myself, I'm going to work hard  so they don't ever have to get their phone call.  Like, hey, at the house.  I would do that so you could have somewhere to live  if everything fucks up.  Yeah, I know, right.  When did you know it was time to like,  when you're playing, it's always interesting to me  when an athlete steps down.  Like that's got to be the hardest decision you have to make.  Like what told you it's time to just go on to something else?  It wasn't hard.  I was used to playing at a super high level.  So then when I started playing at a regular level,  it just didn't look good or feel good.  Like I remember one time in Boston, 
[02:22:00]  I only had six points.  I was like, this shit ain't me.  I mean, it's fantastic.  Oh, I can mother...  Like this isn't me.  And, you know, it doesn't last forever.  And, you know, luckily I have things to fall back on.  And I wish I could have did a little bit better  at Boston last year, but I ripped my Achilles in half.  But, you know, my goal was to win the whole thing  and then just walk away.  That would have been a nice way to end the story.  But, you know, I had fun and had a great press conference. 
[02:22:30]  And, you know, we moved on.  Who was the first guy you played against  that kind of like was one of your idols  or the first time you had to face somebody on the court  that made you nervous?  Patrick Ewing.  Really?  Really?  That was when I came here to the guard and articles.  And Patrick Ewing tried to break my thumb  when he gave me a fist bump.  Oh, shit.  But I knew marketing-wise that if you can play in New York,  you can play anywhere.  So I shot it and I made it and it felt pretty good.  I was like, so you know what?  I'll do it.  Suffering Knicks fan right here.  We would have loved to have you.  Jeez. 
[02:23:00]  All these years, it's been a drought for the Knicks.  What do you think of the Knicks team right now  and Jeremy Lin and all that?  Pretty good.  But, you know, I've been waiting for Carmelo and Amari  to step up.  Amari's out, though.  Yeah, he's out.  For probably the rest of the year.  It's a bulging.  Huh?  You know, Carmelo's a great player,  but at some point in his career,  he's going to have to take it personal  that they talk about him fifth.  You know, when I was coming up,  even though they had Ewing and Robinson,  I was like, I'm going to make you guys talk about me first. 
[02:23:30]  I don't care who's there.  So, you know, he's a great player.  He just has to, you know, step up and lead.  And I tell him this every time I see him.  Like, hey, we need more out of you.  It's not enough to, you know, hit shots every now and then.  You got to put up big numbers and you got to dominate.  Do you think Jeremy Lin's the real deal?  A lot of hype, obviously.  No, he's a good player.  But, you know, what he did, you know,  kid came out of nowhere and brought the Knicks  from seven games to, you know, brought them to 500  and then, you know, reality kicked in. 
[02:24:00]  But, you know, he's a smart player.  He's a smart player.  Have you really been training in MMA since 2000?  Yes.  What do you take and do you like to watch it?  Oh, I love to watch it.  I think those guys are phenomenal athletes.  Kind of jealous of them.  I wish, you know, we could have did some of that stuff  in the NBA.  But, you know, they're great athletes.  I would like to see that too.  That'd be hilarious.  It's a great sport.  The Fertito brothers and Dana White have done a fabulous job.  We love Dana.  Yeah.  You know, just make them a great sport. 
[02:24:30]  Every time I get a chance, I always go.  It's just fabulous.  Do you got a favorite fighter or a fight you want to see?  Well, I want to see the John Bones Jones  against Rashad Evans fight.  Who do you want now?  Well, I mean, no disrespect to John Bones,  but I'm down with the old guys.  So, you know, Rashad, and I've been a fan of his.  And, you know, they know each other.  So I think it's going to be a very, very interesting fight.  I'm kind of pulling for Rashad too.  Are you?  Yeah, we had Bones.  We had all those guys.  And I always get, like, a move put on me or something. 
[02:25:00]  And he choked me and this guy, Bob.  But he choked a little longer than he was supposed to.  Yeah, he made a great sound.  A little longer, yeah.  He just went, oh!  And it made it hurt, Shaq.  Rashad put me in a move too.  What was the move?  He put me on a floor move, which was awful in his thighs.  But he stopped immediately.  So I don't want to see Rashad pull it off.  It was a prison assault is what it was.  It looked bad, man.  How about Chael Sonnen fighting Silva in Brazil in front of 80,000 people?  Chael Sonnen is fighting.  I don't know Chael Sonnen.  He fought Silva a few years ago, and he actually beat him for five hours. 
[02:25:30]  Shaq just looked at E-Rock walk in in the middle of his interview.  He's looking behind the glass.  Oh, wait a minute.  That guy was in there.  Oh, he sees Paul.  That guy was over there.  Watch it now.  Then that guy looked like he was from one of those.  Watch it.  Looks like one of those A&E biker shows.  Yeah.  Shaq, why are you in here, E-Rock?  You just distracted our interview with Shaq.  Yeah, you just blundered in.  We're professional broadcasters.  Invect everything.  We're having fun.  I wasn't trying to.  I was going to pull up the video of you getting choked. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, boy.  He doesn't care about that.  You don't care.  What, are we going to play videos for Shaq?  We're talking to him.  Yeah.  Hey, Shaq, do you want to see my home movies?  What are we going to do?  Bring my photo album in?  Why don't you show them your comic book collection?  Fucking get out.  Just kidding.  Hit the bricks.  Hit the bricks.  You interested in guns?  You like shooting?  In law enforcement, right?  Yeah, I'm law enforcement.  That's pretty goddamn cool.  I don't want a few.  I just, you know, as a guy and as a citizen, you know, I have to be careful how to answer 
[02:26:30]  this question.  Yeah, I understand.  So I do what the law allows me to do.  Yeah.  Let's just put it that way.  But do you enjoy going to the range and blessing us around?  Well, I mean, the only time I go for the range is when it's law enforcement purposes.  Okay.  I hear you.  All right.  Yeah.  I understand.  Well, plus when you're in a position where you're, again, you're one of the most recognizable  guys in the country.  Is there any, when's the last time you went somewhere where nobody in the room knew who  you are and you could just kind of relax and eat and probably can't?  Nowhere?  Nowhere.  Like maybe when you were teenagers the last time you were there? 
[02:27:00]  Jesus Christ.  That's got to be...  When were they paying attention to you?  At what age?  15.  15 years old.  My God.  Wow.  I guess you get used to it.  Like everything you do is going to be seen and reported on.  Right.  Does it make you text differently and email differently and communicate differently privately?  No.  You have no fear that it's going to be...  Yeah.  Because most of the stuff I do is not 99% for the only or so.  And every now and then person may sell a text or tell an email.  But my mother always calls me and tells me her favorite Bible quote, no weapon formed 
[02:27:30]  against me shall prosper.  So you can sell a text and sell an email and get you $1,500, but it's not...  Is that how much they go for?  I guess.  I don't know.  Jesus.  Thank God I'm not famous.  Oh, is there a lot of dirt out there on me?  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  I have no...  Believe me, if I ever become an athlete or become famous, there is a lot of filth.  Did you just say become an athlete?  Yeah, I was kidding.  I was just kidding.  I like a little mixed martial arts.  I mean, Shaq's very tall, but I could always get in there and take him down on a single. 
[02:28:00]  No way.  Oh, sure.  No way.  No, I stink.  Not only am I short, but I do a little elliptical.  I mean, you know, I don't want to talk a whole bunch of exercise with Shaq.  What, five minutes, ten minutes?  I'm a 30-minute elliptical guy.  I play a little iPad chess.  Shaq, you still play basketball?  No.  Not at all?  Do you shoot around or anything?  You just don't want to...  I mean, I just said I'm just getting over this Achilles injury, so...  Wow, yeah.  Still got a little hitch, so I haven't done anything.  I just...  I've been working out the last couple weeks. 
[02:28:30]  Charles Barkley challenged me to a shirt-off competition May 15th, so...  Oh, wow.  So, I've been...  A shirt-off competition.  I've been comfortable in my skin for a long time, so I've been working out.  I love Barkley.  Yeah.  He keeps it real, too, man.  He does.  He's great to watch.  What separates you from...  Because you seem almost...  Like, you see a lot of guys that leave the game, but then there's guys like you and Jordan  who seem to be kind of above basketball ending who you are and people knowing you.  It's like you just kind of continued being Shaq in the public eye. 
[02:29:00]  You know, it's luck.  You know, I go to a lot of corporations and they ask me my strategy.  I was like, well, I don't really have a strategy.  You know, I've always just been myself.  Well, sign on the line.  You know, I just like to, you know, throw the product out there and, you know, good  thing about products that if it's real, the people will take it to it.  So, I think, you know, there's a lot of kids that look at me and say, you know what, if  he did it, I can do it, rather than, you know, coming in and faking and trying to use the  big words and doing it because kids are the smartest beings on earth. 
[02:29:30]  They know who's real and they know who's making stuff up.  And did you...  Because you came up in Newark for a few years before, I think, what you went to...  I want to say it was the South or Germany.  Yeah, Germany.  And was there ever a shot where you...  Because I know you said you were doing little, real light B&Es and stuff.  Do you think that had you not moved out of that area, things might have gone totally  differently for you?  My father probably would have stopped me.  You know, he probably would have did the police officer thing first.  And I don't know what...  And then the army second. 
[02:30:00]  Wow, yeah.  He wasn't putting up in any of that crap, right?  Right.  He was an old school disciplinarian.  He was an old school disciplinarian.  I always tell people I live the karate kid sort of life.  Go from the projects of Newark to Germany, down South Texas to Louisiana.  And I think that's why I'm able to relate to all people.  When did you know that you had the basketball skills?  Because it's assumed that a tall guy knows how to play basketball.  We've seen it in every high school in America.  But when did you realize, oh, I got something here?  I mean, I was always a very shy kid. 
[02:30:30]  I didn't get confidence until I heard Dick Vitale say, this guy, if he decides to go to  the NBA, he'll be the number one pick.  Wow.  Because coming out of high school, I was always ranked after New York's own Kenny Anderson.  Oh, really?  So I was always, you know, behind him all the years.  So they talked about him more than they talked about me.  So I was like, you know what?  Maybe I'm not that good.  But then I went to the McDonald's game and showed off.  And he was like, this guy's going to be the best big man ever.  And then one day I was in college and a guy who I never really liked because I was Maddie 
[02:31:00]  Johnson and I had a white friend named Mitch Riles who looked and acted like Larry Bird.  So he used to kick my ass every day.  So I didn't like Larry Bird for that reason.  But one day I'm walking to college and Larry Bird says, Shaquille O'Neal will be the best  big man ever to play the game.  And I was like, damn, Larry Bird knows who I am.  And then all of a sudden you're like Larry Bird.  Yeah.  I was like, I love you, Larry Legend.  And Robert Parrish said, fuck you and walked out.  This is one of the most interesting things I learned about you. 
[02:31:30]  You're a really good dancer.  Yes.  And I mean, you know, I cut a rug now and again, but I would never say I'm a good dancer.  Why did you become a good dancer?  Because before I started playing basketball, I was a break dancer.  Really?  Yeah, I was a break dancer.  And basketball is all about rhythm.  So, you know, I think that's what makes me a dominant big man.  I got rhythm.  I got moves.  I got, you know, basketball is one, two or one, two, three.  Yeah, I can see where you'd be able to dance.  Dancing is one, two, one, two, three.  I can see that would help your game, Jimmy. 
[02:32:00]  But I know this was like, the interesting thing was at a young age, because you always  think that a big guy or a strong guy has everything.  And you obviously, like you said, you had people pick on you or fuck with you.  So you had to develop these things to, so that you said to distract from them seeing  that about you, you learned.  I had to do what all the little guys was doing.  The guys was break dancing and flipping and they was running fast and, you know, they  was climbing up walls and doing parkour before it was called parkour.  So I did everything they did.  I couldn't even pop lock. 
[02:32:30]  You know, I tried.  We all tried when breaking came out.  I think I'm a couple years older.  Just not my thing.  Any embarrassing pictures of you in a neon suit and big puffy hat break dancing?  No.  No, huh?  That video would sell.  Oh, man.  A young shack break dancing?  Bringing out the piece of cardboard in the boombox.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So I say you also, you stuttered when you were younger.  Was that like, was that a constant thing?  And how did you overcome that?  I overcame it.  I met this speech therapist one day. 
[02:33:00]  She said, just be cool when you talk.  Just be cool.  But what happened?  Would you get scared?  No, just like, try to talk fast or get nervous and then they would stutter.  But now I know how to be cool with it.  I know how to, like, fake a smile or say um and, you know, just, you know, move on to  something else.  But hey, I love this show.  I guess it helps if you can laugh at yourself, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I always laugh at myself.  Did that come from getting teased growing up and you had to learn to fire back when you 
[02:33:30]  were a dead man?  No, I just, you know, like to laugh.  You know, I think people that take this stuff a little too seriously need to turn up their  sense of humor levels.  I love to laugh.  I mean, I grew up watching Good Times, Sanford and Son, Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley.  I love to laugh.  Red Foxx, I just read his book.  You know, hilarious guy, but not a good business.  It's another, there's an example of a guy who constantly made odd business decisions.  He's like, did nobody love you enough to tell you not to invest in a fucking car fur on  the outside of the car? 
[02:34:00]  He did.  He did.  It was, it was, it was, whatever it's called.  It looked cool, though.  But put fur on the outside of your car and he didn't consider the fact that it would rain  and he lost a million dollars doing that.  Oh, my God.  He wanted to make it a business instead of just for his own car?  Hilarious.  He was just one of those guys.  He was a good guy.  He gave out a lot of money.  He was a generous dude and he just.  Sanford and Son was an amazing show.  He needed a guy like, like you in his life.  Who's your favorite comic if you had to pick one?  That's a lot.  You know, in this world we live in, we don't have to just go with one anymore.  So, there's just a lot.  I mean, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock and Chris Tucker and Cat Williams and now Kevin Hart. 
[02:34:30]  And we got a new one that we're working on, Gary Owens, who's a white guy.  Yeah, he's from B2.  Yeah, he's, so, you know, it's a lot of comedians.  But the good thing about comedy is, like, there's different type of comedies.  Like, I love the guy who does the redneck jokes.  Jeff Foxworthy?  Oh, I love him.  Oh, you love Foxworthy?  Oh, my God.  It's funny.  I like him.  You know, I like their style of comedy.  I just love laughing.  If you weren't a ball player or if you weren't an athlete, would you want to be an actor or a professional dancer or a comic? 
[02:35:00]  Like, what would you?  I would love to be an actor, one of the action star, one of those big, big, strong, you know, guys on TV who really didn't have to act.  Just say.  Like Carl Weathers.  Yeah, Carl Weathers.  And they'll just say, you know, the one crazy line that's going to make me a lot of money.  I'll be back.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  He gets an award.  Yeah, it's like one of those lines that kind of sinks in.  Like, for Eastwood, it was, go ahead, make my day for Schwarzenegger.  There's always that one.  Hasta la vista, baby. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, Arnold had quite a few.  There's nothing worse than somebody trying to have one of those lines and it fails miserably.  You know?  Call me in an hour.  You're like, oh, fuck.  Fail.  Fail.  Fail.  Fail.  Terrible.  You say you have a sense of humor about yourself.  Have you seen some of the parodies people have done of you?  Of course.  I remember one from, I think it was Mad TV.  Yeah, I love it.  And they were doing your Icy Hot commercial, doing a parody of it.  I love it.  It was hilarious, man.  And I actually, you know, sometimes when I see comedians, I say, hey, talk about me.  Oh, yeah?  I love it. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  I love it.  That's cool.  I don't get mad.  I like to laugh.  You know who told me to talk about them?  I met, I was hosting the Porn Awards in 2004 and Mike Tyson was on the expo floor.  So we got introduced very, very briefly and he kept telling me, he's like, go up, tell  everybody I'm a pimp.  Tell everybody I'm a pimp.  Talk about me tomorrow.  And I'm like, all right, Mike.  Of course I didn't because.  Why wouldn't you?  Because he didn't show up.  I'm not going to listen to Tyson.  Oh, yeah.  You kind of yes somebody to death when they're fucking.  Have you met?  He's a menacing guy.  Even though he's a nice guy.  Tyson, there's nothing scarier than a championship heavyweight fighter. 
[02:36:30]  There's a, I've met, I've met Tyson and he's a great guy.  I actually went to visit him when he was incarcerated.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I went to visit him and you know, he's always been very, very hospitable to me.  You know, great guy.  Yeah.  He was pleasant both times I met him.  Nice guy.  There's this air though.  This, uh, you kind of feel with a guy like Tyson, like there's not that professional amateur  boundary.  If I do something stupid, he's going to, he's going to react to me like a man, not a detached.  What are you going to be?  Well, exactly. 
[02:37:00]  A victim.  What am I going to be?  The fucking plaintiff.  He's going to, he's going to knock.  I said, he's going to knock you the fuck out.  We all know that.  There's a few guys you just know.  That's hilarious.  Chuck Liddell would do that.  Chuck Liddell would, you know, one wrong turn.  I think we're more scared of John Jones than fucking Chuck for some reason.  Yeah, John Jones.  Because he's a younger guy, man.  I would like.  Chuck.  Chuck's a, Chuck's a brawler.  Yeah.  John could, John could throw some blows too, but Chuck's one of those guys at the bar.  Yeah, Chuck looks like he's a bar problem.  No, we're talking about the guys that would just snap. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, Liddell would snap in an instant.  Liddell would lay like a beer stein upside your head and then just pound you.  He alpha males you when he talks to, but he doesn't mean to, like he's a really nice  dude, but he kind of just like leans in with his big barrel chest and his fucking face  is right by your ear.  And you're like, people think he's menacing me, but he's like, I really enjoyed you.  And you're like, well, thanks.  Don't forget about how he breathes like a bull too.  Yeah, because his nose is broken a couple of times.  Yeah, yeah.  He came to the improv one night with Dana.  I was in LA and he's fucking heckling me.  I'm being heckled by Liddell.  And you took it.  What did he do?  I laughed it off like a girl. 
[02:38:00]  I tee-heed him.  I didn't fucking.  Well, you should.  Speaking of fighting, I just want to tell Shaq, I'm so glad I didn't knock on your door.  We were on vacation at the same time.  You have no idea.  Trust me.  I know that.  But you were down in Turks and Caicos.  This was about four or five years ago.  And me and my now wife were in a room and someone was making a lot of fucking noise upstairs.  And I'm like, I'm going to go up there and say something.  Turned out, to make a long story short, it was you upstairs.  Was it me or the kids?  You had everybody. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  You had a lot of people down there.  They pretty much had the...  Sorry.  No, but I'm thinking, you know, I'm going to be a man and do the right thing.  You were in Turks.  What were you trying to do, sleep?  Well, it was later at night, man.  Go out.  And then I learned through the week that, yeah, Shaq's staying right upstairs.  And then you would, you know, I don't know if you want to hear this, but this guy was  beyond cool to every freaking person that came up to him that week.  Beyond cool.  Yeah, is that frustrating, too?  Like, is there ever a place where people bother you? 
[02:39:00]  You're like, look, I know you're a fan, but right now, come on.  No, not really.  I just try to be, like, you know, polite.  Like, you know, the other day I was at a Fogo the Chow.  You know, the place where they bring the meat on.  So I'm eating.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Is that Korean barbecue?  No.  It's like the Brazilian.  Yeah.  So I was eating.  With the paddle?  With the red?  Oh, man.  You don't go red ever, do you?  No, I go green.  Oh, I go green the entire time.  I mean, they will bring you all sorts of meat until you finally put that paddle to red.  Until you ask for the ham.  They get very pissy if you ask for the ham.  You have to.  They never just bring the ham.  Why would you go for the ham? 
[02:39:30]  The fucking ham is phenomenal.  It's lovely.  You got so much good stuff.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That stuff is fantastic.  So I was eating, and the lady was, like, in, like, mid-night.  Can you take a picture?  I was like, not right now, man.  I'm eating.  But other than that, like, I'll either say yes, or I'll try to give you a polite no.  I never understood, like, that's, like, the hackiest thing a fan can do is come up  to somebody while they're eating.  It's like everyone knows that's not the time to do it.  I was like, you want me to drop a sausage to take a picture?  I'll drop the sausage. 
[02:40:00]  I don't think so, lady.  Yeah, I'll ask anybody, but never while they're eating.  It's like, wait outside.  If you want, like, make yourself inconvenient.  Stand there, wait, and then try to get somebody.  Jimmy's the pro at that.  Last time I went there, I went with my cousins and a couple uncles, and we all had shit stories  the next day.  Well, you're packing so much meat.  Oh, well, yeah.  You're amazed what your body can do the next day.  How do you know I'm packing so much meat?  When you're next to me in the bathroom stall, one of my cousins.  That's my nickname.  I pack a lot of meat.  I pack a lot of meat. 
[02:40:30]  One of my cousins.  I call him Red Paddle.  Couldn't wait to call me and tell me he shit the whole way back home on the Long Island Railroad.  We're eating so much meat.  You can't eat there every week.  It's a pleasant story.  But it is.  A bunch of guys related.  Yeah, I hear you.  There's one on 46th Street called Plataforma, which is really good.  I think that's the one I went to.  It's fucking fantastic.  We ate at them in Rio.  You ever been to Rio?  Yes.  They have, I mean, in between brothel breaks, you have to have food.  And I would run to the original. 
[02:41:00]  Brothel breaks.  Can you define that?  Well, I would take a 100 milligram Viagra and run into a place and just really.  Oh, brothel.  Yeah, brothel.  Yeah, I really misbehaved.  With a bunch of comedians.  Yeah, a bunch of us went.  And they were just laughing at each other in their bathrobes.  It was fun.  With their hard-ons.  Yeah, it was just a tough place.  Is that the place you can get the regular massage or the home or run massage?  Oh, they didn't play.  No, there was not even the hint of massage.  It was like, I like you.  Because there was no language connection. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's weird how you make out with girls in that situation.  Like, I was kissing prostitutes.  Jesus.  I don't say that, you know, proudly, but I just, I did.  I don't know why I'm talking about this.  So, Dove products are on.  When you're done, you really want to scrub up and then smell good afterwards.  And I suggest Dove, that body wash that Shaq is promoting.  Be comfortable in your own skin.  Right.  Be comfortable in your own skin.  Is that kind of the theme of it? 
[02:42:00]  Yes, that's the slug line.  Because it actually does smell.  It's weird.  I like it.  I really do.  No, it's nice.  It's really nice.  And what do they have?  They have, because we only got the deodorant and I think like the face and body wash.  Do they have other stuff?  They got shampoo?  Yeah, they got all that stuff.  And creams and stuff like that?  I'm going shampoo now.  Head to toe.  They got everything.  What do you do when you get a product pitched to you?  Do you say, all right, let me try this for a week and see if I like it?  Well, if I've never tried it before, I'll just be like, nah, probably not.  Like, for example, after my first championship, Wheaties contacted me. 
[02:42:30]  But I told my manager, who was my uncle, Uncle Mike, I was like, I'm, you know, growing  up in Newark, we couldn't afford Wheaties.  But if you call Frosted Flakes a fruit loop, tell them I want to be on the cover.  So he contacted them.  They weren't really doing it.  They wouldn't really call them?  No, because, no, he called them, but they was like, well, no, we've never really done  it before.  But why wouldn't they do that?  So the second year, he was like, hey, Wheaties want you again?  I'm like, nah, man.  Right.  Frosted Flakes.  And I even added one.  It was like Rice Krispies. 
[02:43:00]  Fruit Loops.  They wouldn't do it.  So the third year, I was like, you know what?  Forget all those people.  Just call Corn Flakes.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So then after the one in Miami, D-Wade had a deal with Wheaties.  So they put me and him on the cover.  Isn't that weird?  Like, what bad marketing by the company to not have you on the cover eating Wheaties?  Or I'm sorry, or whatever.  Frosted Flakes.  Frosted Flakes.  That's just dumb on their part.  Fruit Loops gets Shaq on their cereal boxes?  Everyone would be talking about that.  Probably some dumb marketing executive. 
[02:43:30]  Well, technically, it could be a fan of their Spurs who might not buy it, not realizing that  that's just great advertising.  I remember my parents telling me, because I love Frosted Flakes, and it's like, oh, I want  Frosted Flakes.  And they're like, we'll get Corn Flakes.  You put a little sugar on it.  It's the same thing.  It's like, no, but it's not the same thing.  It's not, but when you're growing up, like how we grew up.  Oh, it'll do.  Believe me.  Yeah, yeah.  I got Frosted Flakes, man.  This is the best.  I got one more basketball question.  You think LeBron James is going to get it done?  Ever?  One day, yeah.  I think he will.  One day.  You think he'll get it done in Miami with Dwayne and Bosh? 
[02:44:00]  Uh, it's set up that way.  It's set up that way.  Well, obviously.  But now all the other teams are catching up, and they're getting their superstar team together.  It took Mike how many years to get it?  Well, I want to say, uh...  Six.  Did it take him six years?  Oh, yeah.  Did he not get it until after Pippen was there, or was Pippen always there?  No, I'm not sure.  Took him six.  He won eight.  Eight.  Took me eight.  Took you eight?  Yeah, took me eight.  I couldn't believe you played 19 years.  I was like, because I remember when your career started, it's like, Jesus Christ, that was 
[02:44:30]  a 20-year run.  So, I mean, hopefully he will get it.  But, you know, the unfortunate thing, the greater you are, one is not enough.  Like, I can remember busting my ass to get one, and then, like, they let me celebrate  on the ESPN one day.  And then, could the Lakers become a dynasty?  Yeah.  Did they get two?  I was like, now you gotta...  Yeah, so then you gotta get two, or can they get three, and then after we lost the third  one, the Lakers are terrible, trade Shaq, Shaq's too old, and then when I got one... 
[02:45:00]  You ever get frustrated by the media?  Yeah.  Does some of that stuff feed away at you, ever?  I only get frustrated when the ones that don't have G14 classification speak.  But, I used it to drive me, and I used it to, you know, motivate me, so...  What is G14 classification?  I mean, again, for the listeners, I mean, we know, but...  I mean, like, you know, for me, like, if you never played, then I don't know how you  can speak on certain situations.  That's all.  I mean, like, you know, everyone has an opinion, I respect opinion, but don't tell me how to 
[02:45:30]  be a big man when you're not a big man.  Like, you would listen to Barkley saying it, obviously.  No, not even Barkley.  Oh, really?  Because...  Oh, because he never won a championship.  No, not only that, but because I'm more classified than he is.  Nice.  I like that.  So, like, you know, like, for example, Bill Walton only has 6,000 points.  Like, he would say certain things, and I'd be like, how do you know, Bill?  I got 20,000 points already.  You know what I'm saying?  So, you know, my thing with Bill was, like, you know, we're both in the federal building, 
[02:46:00]  but you're on the lower floor, and I'm up.  You know, it's only, you know, two guys that have more clearance than me, and that's Kareem  and Chamberlain.  Who else would you put in the top five centers of all time?  Obviously, Shaq, Wilt, Kareem.  I don't put myself in the top five.  Well, you're being humble.  We would.  No, I never did.  But you got to go with Bill, Kareem, and Wilt, those three.  And then I'm going to put either Akeem or Patrick Ewing in front of me. 
[02:46:30]  We're getting...  They're telling us we have to wrap up.  Oh, really?  Shaq.  Shaq's a busy guy.  He is on the press, but let's just give a good plug.  I don't want to stay here.  Oh, that's nice.  Thank you.  I love these guys.  Especially this weird-looking guy in the back.  Sam.  Yes.  The big eyebrows.  I know.  Don't they look like a Muppet?  Yeah.  We're not sure of his race or gender.  He's just kind of creepy.  He looks whamish.  What is that?  White and Spanish?  Yeah.  Oh, whamish.  Yeah, whamish.  Maybe you're Spanish.  We're trying to figure it out. 
[02:47:00]  And the camera girl's hot.  Hey, sexy camera girl.  Hey, you still with Hoops?  Yes.  Love the Hoops.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Hoops is sexy.  Sorry.  I mean, I hope it is.  Watch your mouth, man.  What the hell is going on?  Love the Hoops.  I've got to get out of this show.  I love the Hoops.  I'm going to kill this guy.  The product is Dove products, the Dove line.  Be comfortable in your skin.  And honestly, it's easy just to say it, but they really are good.  And I've been using them for the last, I guess, five days since we had them.  They smell great.  And they really are good. 
[02:47:30]  I'm psychic.  She's from Detroit.  You?  Oh, wow.  All right.  I didn't even notice that.  That's great.  You are observant.  She's been in here 50 times, and I've never noticed that.  Detroit tat.  I just look at a woman's eyes.  I know how to read, people.  So thanks, Shaquille.  Yeah, absolutely.  I might ask you to take a photo, but again, just for the website, you know.  I normally wouldn't.  Of course.  I'm a great fan, man.  Thanks, man.  I'll see you guys.  All right.  Yeah, please come back and see us.  Shaquille.  O'Bee and Anthony's Worst of 2012 continues right now. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, now, now.  Hey, it's E-Rock hosting the Worst of 2012 for the O'Bee and Anthony show.  In this segment right here, Franchise O&A makes its return.  It's been a long, long time since Franchise O&A has happened on this show.  And this wasn't scheduled.  This wasn't even something that they really planned.  Like, hey, we'll book a guest, but we don't really want to talk to him.  Tom Hiddleston, he's in the Avengers movie.  He's in the Thor's movie.  The Thors.  Well, yeah, no, that's right, because there's a new Thor, I think, coming next year. 
[02:48:30]  Anyway, he plays Loki, Thor's brother, and he's coming to the studio.  And O&A didn't really think that this was a big enough guest because we weren't going  to talk to Samuel Jackson or Scarlett Johansson or Robert Downey Jr.  They're like, oh, Loki.  And we're trying to tell him he's the main villain.  He's going to be huge.  You need to talk to this guy.  It's a big deal.  The Avengers is going to be a big movie.  Well, Opie and Anthony didn't think so.  So Sam and myself had to step in and make everything go okay with Franchise O&A. 
[02:49:00]  And guess what?  Avengers just broke $600 million domestically.  What do Opie and Anthony know?  Here it is.  Tom Hiddleston on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  2012 so far.  This is O&A's worst of 2012 on the Opie and Anthony channel.  How are you doing?  I'm great.  How are you doing?  Very good.  Monday morning in New York.  Yes.  You're about to be a massive blockbuster superhero villain, I guess, again.  I am, yeah.  It was, I mean, this is my day job these days. 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  I played Loki in Thor, for anyone who saw the Thor movie.  Yeah, sure.  And Loki is Thor's younger brother, his adopted brother, who sort of turns to the dark side  once he finds out the narrative of his life has been a lie.  And in the Avengers, I've come down to Earth to subjugate the entire planet.  Is it a nerve-wracking or whatever, trying to figure out the mythos and get all this comic 
[02:50:00]  book information?  Because the people who love the Avengers are these comic book geeks that know everything  there is to know about the character.  So when you have to explain the character, it's a pop quiz every time.  It's kind of almost like playing a real person.  Like, if you're playing a, I don't know, if I was playing one of the kings of England  or if I was playing a political leader, I'd have to do a lot of work on that person's  actual life.  And the great thing about these comics is that there is a mythology now that goes back 
[02:50:30]  40 or 50 years.  And it's a kind of contemporary mythology, which you can just, I mean, it's an amazing  thing to have a day job where you get up in the morning and you're like, ah, I've  got to go to work.  I've got to read some comics.  Yeah.  You talk about the men who go mad with power.  Was Hitler one of the inspirations behind the Loki?  There is a moment which is quite, you know, there's a moment where Loki is in Germany  with a whole bunch of people at his feet.  My favorite scene in the film.  Is it?  Oh, yes.  My goodness.  Thank you very much.  You know, Captain America has a few things to say about, I think he says, you know, last 
[02:51:00]  time I was in Germany and saw a guy standing up above everybody else, didn't work out.  Something like that.  That Captain America, always the party pooper.  Now, it was, I liked the movie.  I was having a hard time because I was babysitting my kid at the time, trying to piece a lot of  this together.  I saw that there's going to be a Thor 2 and there's word of Avengers 2 and all that.  So you'll be in Thor 2, I'm assuming.  Certainly, yeah.  Avengers 2, is that also on your plate?  Do you make a return or do they go like Batman with a new villain? 
[02:51:30]  Do you know what?  I don't know.  The guys at Marvel are so smart because they employ a group of people who are literally  their job is to work out how the Marvel movie, the Marvel Cinematic Universe works together  like a big jigsaw puzzle.  So that Avengers 2, if there is one, and I don't know that there is, I'm sure they're  planning it, but they haven't told me.  Avengers 2 will have to follow on from the events of Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain 
[02:52:00]  America 2.  And I think they're still working out what Captain America 2 is yet.  You know, Thor 2, I haven't seen a script for Thor 2.  I think they have a story outline.  Iron Man 3 goes into production in a couple of weeks.  So, you know, it's like they are aligning their stars in more ways than one.  I mean, if I'm needed, I'll be there, but if I'm not, then I won't.  It's like the old Hollywood system.  It's either they, they, they, Marvel, they set out to do this series of movies and they're 
[02:52:30]  signing actors for these multiple picture deals.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, it's, you know, you think they're coming, here they come down the  red carpet.  It's the Avengers here to show everybody what, oh, look, here comes Loki.  Watch out, universe.  He may have your number next.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, I mean, I'll be funny.  Go ahead.  What were you saying?  That's old school.  Yeah, it is.  It's very old school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or if it was in, if it was, if it was in Britain, it would be like, and here we have the Avengers. 
[02:53:00]  The Avengers are the crack team of superheroes.  If you believe in superheroes, you want to believe in this team.  Yeah.  Iron Man 4, Captain America and the Incredible Hulk.  It's something that sounds more intelligent, though.  When it's done with a British accent, it sounds like it's a, it's a more intellectual statement.  Do you have a lot, a lot of British actors, at least in American TV now, have been doing  the American accent very well. 
[02:53:30]  Have you had much experience in doing American accents in your projects?  Well, I played F. Scott Fitzgerald in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris.  I don't know if you saw that movie.  No.  Oh, yes.  But I guess he was American.  Could you give us an example of what your American accent would sound like?  Well, he's not here to perform.  Well, no, like, as Scott.  No, but he did that 1940s piece very well.  As Scott Fitzgerald, it was more, I mean, there was a particular way that they spoke  back in the 1940s.  It was, it was with a particular rhythm and it was, you know, like, give me something  to read.  That's incredible.  I see you got a copy of the Daily News here. 
[02:54:00]  Wiped out.  Three generations shattered as seven die on the way to family reunion.  It's amazing.  It blows my mind.  How long does it take you to get that down?  That's so sweet of you guys to say.  I've been, I'm like a geek about, about, about accents and dialects and voices ever since  I can remember.  I've always been doing impressions of people.  You know, as a kid, I used to do impressions of, of, I find it fascinating watching the  news.  I wasn't listening to the news.  I was watching the way people spoke.  American newscasts? 
[02:54:30]  No, no.  British newscasts.  But also because, you know, British, as an English child, you know, the movies that I  watched were American.  I, I grew up watching Superman and Indiana Jones and E.T.  So, so immediately, like your ear is attuned to something, but you could ask me to do an  Irish accent or a Scottish accent.  I mean, there are some accents I'm, I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  It's amazing that it's like, it's a different person when, when we're looking at you with  that accent.  Like, I'm not good with voices.  There's one, the only voice I do is Dice, Andrew Dice Clay.  And it's like, you know, this guy, he sounds like a British actor. 
[02:55:00]  G-g-g-g-g-g-g.  That's pretty good.  This girl, she had a British accent when she was looking at my ass.  Say g-g-g-g-g-g-g.  Like, that's the only one that I do.  The challenging thing that I find is to speak in a neutral American accent in my own voice.  So it's like, who is Tom, who is Tom if he's speaking in an American, I mean, I can do  a lot of character voices, but I find I try, I mean, how does this sound?  This is like trying to be me, but talking in an American dialect.  It sounds pretty American. 
[02:55:30]  You're doing a good job with that.  Good job.  Not to, not to, like, nasal, because a lot of British actors, they kind of go to that  place where they're like, it all comes through the nose, because somehow, like, British  actors think that Americans all talk through, which is not true.  It's not true.  Do you do a Ronald Reagan?  Give me a Ronald Reagan for me.  Like, it goes, it's like, it's like, well, I don't recall.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.  Something like that.  I can't do a Reagan.  Well, we can't do them all.  Because if I've heard it, if I've heard it, I can do it. 
[02:56:00]  I see.  You can't do it all.  I mean, that was pretty spot on, my impression.  It was.  Yeah.  That can't be bested.  Yeah.  What's that guy from Cool Hand Luke who Nirvana used to use, no, Guns N' Roses used at the  beginning of Civil War?  Oh, oh.  What we've got here is failure to communicate.  I forgot his name.  Some man you just can't reach.  Would you be up to talking to some of the audience?  Of course I would, yeah.  All right.  Let's go to this line here.  Hello.  You're on with Tom Hiddleston. 
[02:56:30]  Hey, Tom.  How you doing, man?  Hey, man.  I'm good.  How are you?  Very good.  I can't wait to see the movie.  What is it?  Open Friday, right?  Friday.  Oh, possibly even Thursday night.  Friday wide.  Friday wide.  Yeah.  To see the movie.  And as a little, I don't know, as a little kind of gesture, because I hear the movie's  very good.  I hear you're very good.  And I'll let you in on something.  Where's Opie and Anthony, by the way?  Where are Opie and Anthony?  Where are they?  Here.  Where are they?  They're right here. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Are they?  Are they really?  What is this?  Yeah.  Sorry.  We get prank calls time to time here.  I apologize for that.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Strange.  What's the difference between working on a more dramatic film like that, or the Woody  Allen film, versus a blockbuster like the Avengers?  It's funny, because in a way, an actor's job is the same.  Yeah.  But isn't it more, like, I would assume the Avengers had a lot more green screen, a lot 
[02:57:30]  more sort of, so is that more difficult?  Well, you know, like, there's a moment in War Horse where the character I play, Captain  Nichols, leads a cavalry charge across No Man's Land.  There's a very big kind of moment where you see Nichols see the guns, and the whole thing  goes into slow motion, and he's being shot at.  Now, inevitably, on the day, there were no guns, and there were no real bullets, and,  you know.  Right.  It was, so I was looking at the forest of trees, and I had to imagine the guns, and the  soldiers, and the bullets, and that's just like playing Loki in the Avengers, and imagining 
[02:58:00]  that Manhattan is falling apart, and imagining that the Hulk is there, screaming in my face.  I'm getting the sign here that he has to go.  You're doing TV and some other press here.  Real quick, my favorite scene, without giving anything away, you and the Hulk.  It's a big showdown.  Yes.  But it was probably the best scene in the movie, at least for me.  Thank you very much.  The Avengers this Friday.  Thank you so much for coming in.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Such a pleasure.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012. 
[02:58:30]  12, 12, 12, 12.  Continues right now.  My name is E-Rock, hosting the worst of 2012 for the Opie and Anthony show.  This segment, Ricky Gervais is back.  It's been a while since he's been on the show.  We love when he's on the show.  He seems to only do our show around here.  I'm not complaining.  It's a little curious, but whatever.  We get the exclusives, and we get all the good stuff from Ricky Gervais.  He's in studio.  Joe DeRosa also happens to be in studio, and we bring up time to time, well, all the  time now with Joe DeRosa, that he likes Bailey J, who I forget the term that they use now, 
[02:59:00]  but transgender, they don't like me calling him tranny, but it's a girl with a dick.  Anyway, we bring this up all the time with Joe DeRosa, and we talk about Bailey J and  Buck Angel.  Buck Angel is the reverse.  It's a dude with a vagina.  And who would you rather sleep with, or fuck, or whatever you want to call it, Bailey J or  Buck Angel?  And everyone has their own answer.  It's a very difficult topic to discuss. 
[02:59:30]  We ask Ricky Gervais, and we find out it's probably the most unanswerable question in  human history.  Here it is.  This is O.P.  and Anthony's Worst of 2012.  We should ask him the question we were trying to figure out earlier.  I just thought of that.  And this would be perfect for Carl, actually.  Yeah.  You want to explain really fast?  So, there's a transsexual...  Oh!  Oh, that question, right?  Yeah.  There's a transsexual woman, used to be a guy, now she's a girl with a cock, named Bailey 
[03:00:00]  J.  I don't have a thing for transsexuals, but there's something about her I find her incredibly  attractive.  In the balls.  I don't know.  You know, there's something about you that's so different.  It's like, it's like, I'm tired of these girls with vaginas.  I need something to do.  These vagina girls, as I call them. 
[03:00:30]  But you, honey, you've got something special.  It's a challenge.  Can I just say, I'm not laughing at this person.  Of course not.  I'm laughing at his obsession and saying...  Well, we've been laughing at him for a while about this thing.  We'll all be apologizing.  So, she's got a polar opposite now, named Buck Angel.  See, that's Bailey.  Now, this is Buck Angel.  And he's a man.  But, Buck was born a woman and still has complete women parts, vagina, everything. 
[03:01:00]  Okay, that's a woman, okay.  And tattoos.  Right, but he still has his vagina.  Yeah.  Okay.  She was born a model.  She was a model, even.  Do you have a vagina picture of Buck Angel?  I know.  Sorry, I didn't mean to.  It's fine.  Come on.  It's fine.  You shared a lot with us.  We want to share it back.  You have your dumb safety on, I think, on your search.  Whose computer is that?  All right, that's...  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, exactly.  Okay, so...  Not making fun, we're just kind of amazed.  Yeah, very amazed.  Because Buck Angel threatens people.  Well, threatens Joe. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, we've discussed this on the show before about what would you rather do, have sex with  Buck Angel in his vagina or suck Billy J's dick?  And that's the question for you today, Ricky.  Now, Ricky, it's the nudie weird game.  So, this is the question.  Let's bring back the nudie weird game, but with questions like this.  This is the question.  I knew we were married.  How were we married one year?  Okay, well, this is the first question.  It's very...  It's your wife.  Your husband said...  Look, we understand it's not easy.  Oh, he definitely suck a dick. 
[03:02:00]  He definitely suck a dick.  Ricky's too big of a star for this.  I think you might be too big of a star for this.  Hold on, wait a minute.  Hold on.  So, the...  So, the...  So, the...  So, it's a girl who's pretending to be a man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, what...  It's a man.  It's definitely...  It's a man.  That's a man, but...  Oh, God.  A woman.  So, would you rather...  Would you rather...  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Thank you.  I mean, I know I'm taking it more seriously than you should.  No.  No.  We all took it very seriously.  No, we like the serious angle of this. 
[03:02:30]  It's very confusing.  I was saying it is absolutely the Kobayashi Maru.  See, hold on.  From Star Trek.  Is it the...  Is it the event that's terror or the rest of your life?  Yeah, because you do then have to live.  Well, I have my answer.  I have my answer.  I would...  And this is when I got threatened with...  When I said this about Buck Angel.  All right, be careful.  Be careful.  The threatening tweet.  I said I could not get an erection for this man with the vagina.  No, you're going down on the person. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, Jesus.  No, I would...  No, I'm going girl cock all the fucking way.  I go guy...  Sorry that I felt the need to go like this as I said it, too.  I said I go guy with the vagina.  Close your eyes.  Oh, there you go.  Close your eyes.  But you're going to feel male thighs around your head.  Oh, that's a...  Oh, really?  There's what you're talking.  It was a woman.  All right, wait, wait.  All right, there's what you're talking about.  Ricky, that's what Joe's talking about.  Now, Joe, you would do that.  Oh, come on. 
[03:03:30]  That's not only a dick.  That's the biggest dick in the world.  That's just ridiculous.  That is...  That's just rubbing salt in the wound.  That's not...  Oh, God.  There's your choices.  Jesus.  There's your choices, Rick.  Come on, Ricky.  A beer.  A beer.  A beer.  Come on.  Because I'll tell you now, I will never forget that as long as I can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But Joe DeRosa, you're totally fine with that.  Joe goes with B.  I go with A.  I'm going B.  And what are you going with? 
[03:04:00]  A or B.  I'm going without an answer.  You have to answer.  I'm taking the smart room.  You have to answer.  You are going to choke on that.  Yeah, you're really going to have a hard time.  You have to answer it.  When you're eye to eye with that thing, Joe, you'd back out.  I think if you really pretended, it would just be like she was wearing a strap on.  I love the fact this started off with me being an intellectual and talking about quantum physics. 
[03:04:30]  That's the beauty of the show.  You can ask the same questions to Stephen fucking Hawking when he's in.  That's where the question came from.  It came from that physics documentary that I watched.  Unbelievable.  I would suck the dick.  My universe is expanding.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012 continues right now.  Worst of 2012.  For the Opie and Anthony Show, my name is E-Rock.  In this segment, Jeff Goldblum.  He's in studio.  I don't know how to describe this.  We're really excited if you're a fan of Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Fly. 
[03:05:00]  I mean, he's been in so many movies.  And we're so excited to have him in studio.  And he's just an odd dude.  Really nice dude, but just an odd guy.  There's nothing else I can really say.  You just have to hear it for yourself.  This is ONA's Worst of 2012.  So far.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  It's very cold.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  We spoke to you on the phone.  Oh, Jim Norton.  Yes.  I know Jim Norton.  Oh, my goodness.  Crazy about Jim Norton.  Thank you.  You know Jim Norton? 
[03:05:30]  Isn't he great?  He's great.  Thank you.  You guys are great.  We love Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  We talked to you once on the phone.  I know.  Yeah, on the phone.  It was nice to see you here.  I know.  What was I on the phone?  We spoke about a few things, I guess.  You just laughed a lot.  Yeah, we had a lot of time.  We talked about, well, first and foremost, of course, the vigilante, Death Wish.  Right.  Of course.  One of your very early roles.  Yeah, it's still my favorite thing.  Not that I don't love your other work, but that's still the greatest line I think ever uttered.  It has absolutely made it to the machine here. 
[03:06:00]  Goddamn rich cunt.  Oh, you got headphones there.  Yeah, but he doesn't want to mess up his hair.  I know that a lot.  You know that a lot?  That sounds great.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  Jeez.  That's very strong.  That's some strong language there, sir.  Can you play that on the radio?  Oh, yeah.  It's satellite.  So we can...  A lot of latitude.  I see.  Look at that.  Oh, now I'm on FM radio.  A lot of, yeah, a lot of latitude, you know. 
[03:06:30]  I see.  Okay.  But that was such a fun role, I think.  I mean, you looked like you were having a great time there.  A little hijinks and shenanigans in the apartment.  A little goddamn rich cunt.  It was brutal.  Yeah.  You really knew that thing?  You really remember that thing?  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, I was thrilled to do it.  It was the first thing I ever auditioned for.  It was kind of a miraculous story.  I loved it, yeah.  But, you know, I was a kid.  I'd just come out of the neighborhood playhouse studying with Sandy Meisner.  And, you know, and a bunch of, three guys at a time went into this room, and we improvised 
[03:07:00]  little, you know, this little rape and murder scene, and they picked me.  How about that?  So, let me ask you a question about Meisner, too.  Like, what's the difference between that and, say, like, what Brando took, method acting?  What's the technique difference?  That's a very interesting question.  Oh, you know, they all came out of the group theater.  Strasburg and Stella Adler and Meisner. 
[03:07:30]  And then they differed in a little bit of their, this is inside baseball stuff, in their technique,  you know.  So, they differ.  But they all came out of that in the 30s, if you know the group theater.  There's a wonderful book called The Fervent Years that's all about that.  Stanislavski was doing what he was doing in Moscow around that time.  And they changed American acting in the 30s.  And I guess it's too boring to go into the details of how Strasburg and Meisner kind of parted theoretical ways. 
[03:08:00]  But, you know, basically all those modern actors are trying to, we're trying to do something a little different  than what had been done before, whereby they make it a more authentic, lived out, actor-experienced story.  So, you really feel like you're not just being presented with an actor.  But, you know, when Brando first walked on stage, people said,  geez, is that a stagehand who has just wandered on the stage?  It was a little more true to life, you know, that kind of thing. 
[03:08:30]  That amazes me that there's, it's so much work and studying to just look natural.  We were talking about it.  Jim was talking about seeing you in your play.  Seminar.  Yes, very good.  And just saying.  Last night.  You did, you saw it last night?  Yeah, it was great.  Thank you for coming.  Yeah.  How great and natural it was, is what Jimmy was saying.  Your acting is, yeah, fantastic.  It was amazing when you, because I watch, because I panic when I have to act,  and I just kind of stand all stiff and shit. 
[03:09:00]  And when I watch somebody who's so good, I watch your hand motions,  and it's very natural the way you gesticulate and talk.  And I'm like, that's just how he is probably off.  You don't feel like you're watching somebody act.  You just feel like you're watching a guy talk to four different people on stage.  It's really interesting to watch.  Very sweet.  Thank you very much.  And it was funny.  And it's funny, isn't it?  Yeah, it's at the Golden Theater.  It's 90 minutes.  It's a lot of laughs.  People are naked in it.  There's some girls who are naked in it sometimes.  There's sex going on.  And I love the play.  Teresa Rebeck wrote it. 
[03:09:30]  A brilliantly talented, smart, funny author.  And Sam Gold, who, if people don't know, is a hot and spectacular young director.  He's done a few things on right now.  He was great to work with.  And then that cast, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Heddy Ann Park and Jerry O'Connell, whom you know, and Justin Long and Zoe Lister-Jones.  They're fantastic.  Jimmy said Justin Long was great.  Yeah, and I didn't know.  And so was Jerry.  I didn't know the women's names.  But I will say the best nipple I've probably ever seen. 
[03:10:00]  Mine?  Well, yeah.  Well, that kind of went without saying.  I mean, after yours.  Oh, you're talking about Heddy Ann.  Well, that's high praise indeed.  What made it the best nipple, though?  It was just thick.  And I noticed it from the third row.  I hit Bob Kelly.  I'm like, that's the best fucking nipple I've ever seen.  Did it take you out of the play for a second?  Dude, I couldn't stop looking at her.  It was just so sexy when she just, you know.  Did it have the slow fade into the, uh.  Oh, sorry, Justin.  This is how you, we hope not to diminish or vulgarize what you do.  But Heddy Ann Park is a master artist herself. 
[03:10:30]  That's sexy.  Yes, she is sexy.  Do you do a lot of theater, uh, over the, over the years?  Have you done a lot of theater?  You know, I started doing theater even before Death Wish.  Right around that time, I had done, uh, Two Gents, this musical of Two Gentlemen of Verona  at the St. James Theater with Raul Julia.  And, uh, then El Grande at Coca-Cola, this funny show.  And da-da-da-da-da-da.  And then through the years, some other things, a few other Broadway shows.  So you're a song and dance man, too?  Well, I wouldn't say that, really.  I love music.  Music is part of my life, though. 
[03:11:00]  I play piano.  I have a jazz band in Los Angeles called the Mildred Schnitzer Orchestra.  And when I'm there, when I'm not working, we play out and about.  And I play with really great musicians.  If you're out there, you should come to see where we are.  It's fun.  Who's in the band with you at one point?  Somebody, I just read something.  Somebody said they were in...  Well, Peter Weller originally kind of started it.  You know, we were in a movie together, uh, you know, Buckaroo Banzai.  We met and we started to play it.  But there are a lot of...  But he's since married as a kid recently and has gone off.  But the core group keeps changing a little bit. 
[03:11:30]  But I play with great musicians.  Anthony Wilson has played with us recently.  He's a premier guitar player right now.  Brilliant musician.  Plays with Diana Krull right now.  And some other guys who are just great.  You know what you're great at too?  And I like watching you talk.  You're great at doing...  There's a couple of amazing monologues you have.  And I've never seen anybody so good at just taking words and making them his.  It's like watching you talk right now is exactly like watching you talk when you act. 
[03:12:00]  It's fucking...  It's depressing.  It's so good.  It's depressing.  And I'm watching for it.  You're depressing, Jimmy.  No, but I mean that in a good way.  Yeah, yeah.  It's effortless.  But it's effortless.  It's effortless.  These weird pacing moments and not delivering.  Like, you know, I just go, ah, line, line, line, period.  Line, line, line, period.  Watching the way your cadence and your pacing is fucking great, man.  Thank you so, so much.  You know, I'm a humble student at it.  I'm trying to get better at it.  But it fascinates me.  It always has. 
[03:12:30]  I teach myself out in California whenever I'm not working for the last 20, 30 years.  And I'm a kind of craft geek.  You know, I love to figure out how to...  It seems simple.  And it's, you know, it may, on a certain level, it might be simple.  You know, we're talking.  We show up.  We can do things.  It seems like it's talking.  But really, when you see people do it on a high level, not necessarily myself, but it's what excites me.  And what I'd love to strive for is it can be a refined, beautiful thing. 
[03:13:00]  I've seen acting that has changed my life and had teachers that have changed my life, certainly.  This play is about a teacher.  I play a teacher in it.  And there are people who want to be creative artists, in this case, writers, two guys and two girls.  And that's what it's all about.  It's about the serious business of training people for something serious, especially in the creative arts.  But anything, I suppose, if you're a soldier or if you're an athlete, as we know, you know, if you want to be on the highest level, it's a very elite group that gets winnowed down. 
[03:13:30]  And the first qualification, I think, before we know, even if you're specially gifted and talented, which you finally have to be, is if you've got the entry-level qualification of commitment.  And you're wildly, passionately enthusiastic.  And for some crazy reason, and it's irrational, you're in love with it, like, and you can't live without it.  You want it so badly.  I remember my father saying you can taste it. 
[03:14:00]  That's the only reason you should act.  He knew about that.  He told me that.  And he said if you find something you love to do, that's what to do.  And somehow I was gifted with that early on, not with talent or anything, but with this idea, with a singular and passionate idea.  When I was a kid that came upon me, I don't know, I was watching, I don't know how I, you know, they took us to see children's theater or whatever.  But I got this idea.  And by the time I was in high school, I'd taken a course or two in the summer.  I would, it became a kind of a secret for me.  And every morning when I took a shower, the steam would appear on the door. 
[03:14:30]  And while I was in there, I'd write, please, God, let me be an actor.  And then before I left, I would erase it.  I was absolutely obsessed with it.  And that's basically what I, as the character and the teacher in this show, am trying to find out and let them find out about themselves if that's what they're made of.  I keep saying at the end, the last line of the play is, do you want to be a writer or not?  And it's what I, that's basically my theme as I continue. 
[03:15:00]  I'm a very tough teacher.  Yeah, you just gave away the play, I think.  What, what, what?  Did you just give away the play?  No, he didn't.  Well, not really.  It's the fun is getting there, you know.  And I'm a terrible teacher.  And it's very painful for them.  And they misconstrue it.  And they go, is this guy awful?  Is he a villain?  Is he trying to just beat us down or what?  But, in fact, I'm tearing off Band-Aids, ego Band-Aids, and all kinds of things in order to get to that basic question and get them ignited into a commitment. 
[03:15:30]  You said something in there.  Yeah.  Whose performance blew you away?  You said some.  Through the years?  Yes.  One maybe we would know, because I would assume you probably see a lot of stuff we.  Oh, you know, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know.  Maybe one.  Me, well, you know, when I was a kid, like I said, I saw a children's theater and just the guy playing, you know, Beauty and the Beast.  I was like, what is he doing?  What's he doing backstage and stuff?  But once I got a little familiar with it, oh, geez, I was thinking last night again about Brando.  Now that we mentioned him, you know, on the waterfront, you know, a lot of people will tell you they became actors because that's not true with me. 
[03:16:00]  But, you know, once you know about it and once you see him do it, it's endlessly fascinating to me.  It was such a change between the acting that had gone on and was accepted as acting before and then after that, much more real afterwards.  And before it was this kind of over-the-top theater kind of acting.  Yes, mostly, you know, talented people would emerge here and there. 
[03:16:30]  But he was distinct and it was a landmark.  And when he started to do what he did, and it was because of a change in time and sensibility and, you know, modern art was happening and the other arts, things were progressing and therapy.  And we understood more about the psychology of the individual and were more deeply interested in that and all manner of things.  So, but it changed.  It changed.  Yeah.  Isn't that fascinating?  But I liked early on Peter Sellers.  I was thinking about Peter Sellers early on.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't you love him?  He was great in being there.  I mean, he had some phenomenal stuff. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, what a great movie.  How about Lolita?  I love him in Lolita.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I love him in?  Do you know the, I'll bet you know this movie, After the Fox.  I was talking about it last night.  No, I've never seen it.  No.  It's Vittorio De Sica directed.  It's Neil Simon's first screenplay.  Oh, wow.  He's in it.  It's from a kitsch period in the 60s.  Burt Bacharach does the music.  He sings with the Hollies, in fact, for those trivia experts, the theme song, After the Fox.  The Fox is me.  But it's hilarious. 
[03:17:30]  I saw it when I was a kid with my sister in Pittsburgh at the Leona Theater.  And, but I see it.  And my dresser at the show said, I remember that movie.  I was eight years old when I first saw it.  And I haven't found that since in my adult life.  I had a copy of it and I gave it to him last night.  I love that.  You're absolutely a student of acting.  And because there are some actors that are just like, well, I go up there and I just, you know, make believe for a while.  But you, you know, obviously take it very seriously and still have fun with it. 
[03:18:00]  Do you like, do you like a role like, like you're doing now in the show or, or one of those blockbuster kind of Independence Day roles that, you know, obviously storyline and, and character development isn't as, as important.  But it's, it's a blockbuster.  Yeah.  Well, it's nice to be in something that everybody sees and is excited about.  It's finally, it comes up in the show.  I say, you know, you can be a brilliant writer, but if you're doing it and you're, if you don't, if you keep it in your drawer and nobody sees it, you know, that's not the point. 
[03:18:30]  What we're doing here really, and you may consider yourself brilliant and, oh, it's just for me, but no, no, no.  Let's disabuse ourselves of that idea, especially if it's brilliant.  Let people see it.  So it's nice and gratifying to be in a popular thing, you know, and in fact, those particular shows, Spielberg, he's, yes, there may have been dinosaurs in it and da, da, da.  But the parts that I was in, he was very attentive to, he's brilliant and refined and character oriented and actor savvy and actor passionate. 
[03:19:00]  And so it was creative and, but, you know, you put a little mosaic piece here and there one day after another and it's creative and fun in a different way.  This, I find, this particular show, a real first class conditioning exercise for myself and workout.  There's a great, I'm sorry to interrupt, there's a great, there's a great monologue where you kind of deconstruct Justin Long's character and you kind of paint what it is that he's doing.  And it was really fucking well written and it said so much about, like you just said, people that just want to keep it for themselves instead of exposing. 
[03:19:30]  It was really, really well written and well performed.  Thank you.  I love that.  It's been fun to work on that, like a little, you know, sculptor, sculpting project.  You keep kind of detailing and finding out more about it because it's brilliant writing because it's kind of ambiguous.  It could mean a lot of different things.  But yes, it's an interesting moment in the show, an event.  You know, he's like, there's this brilliant, Justin Long plays a brilliant writer that I recognize, but I also recognize the young me in him. 
[03:20:00]  Me, the character is, I've sabotaged myself with some personal problems and ego and narcissism and, you know, unsociability and this old antiquated idea that if you're brilliant, you have the right and even obligation to be screwy.  And you can't put, you can't have time for or put up with regular people and da-da-da-da-da-da.  And J.D. Salinger is our hero and you have to disappear somehow. 
[03:20:30]  I say, no, no, no, man.  You're really off base there.  And in fact, you've got these ideas, I tell him, because I'll paint you a picture of what's going to happen.  He has just blown this opportunity.  I've just given him, not to give him anything away, but I've just, you know, finally he's shown me his work.  He's been hiding all this time in class.  He shows me his work.  I say, this is absolutely brilliant.  I recognize it immediately.  And I say, I want to see everything you've ever written. 
[03:21:00]  We're going to, I'm going to work on this.  He says, no, you're terrible.  You're a terrible teacher.  You're, you've taken too many drugs.  You're abusing us.  This guy is horrible.  I'm not.  And so he, not only am I, and then he says this thing to me, which was the crux of my undoing career-wise, in fact.  Went for the juggler.  He went for you.  He hits below the belt.  And I'm very hurt.  I'm very sensitive myself.  And so I, with a fierce truth assault, I attack back on him.  But show him what this kind of personal quirk and self-destructiveness will lead to in his life, because I know all too well. 
[03:21:30]  And then I say, and because you just did it here.  This was the main thing.  I offered you the biggest opportunity that you're ever going to have, and you have blown it.  So wake up, pal.  This is great.  It's like seeing part of the play.  I know.  It's so intense, man.  Yeah.  It's like, I'm fixated.  I know.  What's the first thing you do when you see a script?  I always ask great actors that way.  When you get a script, what do you do?  Like, okay, I'm going to play Leonard. 
[03:22:00]  What do you do from there?  How do you, do you memorize the lines first, or do you think about the guy?  I have no formula.  You know, after all this time, I've been being able to tell people what to do.  And there's some meat and potatoes things you can follow.  But finally, it's a creative, you know, little project, an endeavor.  And I, myself, have no formula.  Each one suggests something different.  You know, and, you know, you read it, and, yeah, things will start to occur to you. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, I know about this.  I know about this guy.  Here's a doorway I can go through.  I'm interested in this part of it, this aspect of the character, how to make this funny,  why this, why he's doing that, how this is like my life, how I understand that,  how this is like somebody else I know, da, da, da, da.  And then, yes, I start, I learn it early on, too.  I like to know the words.  I know there are actors who, and there are techniques where you can go, oh, you know, 
[03:23:00]  I'm not going to, I'm not going to learn the words too early.  And that, there's something in that.  But it's also a, say, an excuse for laziness, too.  And there are pitfalls in learning it.  You don't want to become mechanical.  You want to be flexible.  You want to get with the other actors and then adjust to them and adjust to the ideas  of the director.  But you can avoid those somehow, too.  And I find from the day I get the part, there are things that I can do that take up my whole  day. 
[03:23:30]  You have quite a unique way of speaking and body language.  And over the years, people have, people have imitated you.  Do you have a sense of humor about yourself?  Have you seen these and enjoyed them?  I'm always, yeah, it's always funny.  I like them all.  Yeah, who do you know?  Do you know, do anybody here do?  Eli Gold's a friend of mine.  Eli Gold's fantastic.  He's been very sweet to me.  I love his impersonation.  It's very good.  Does it, does it, is it odd to look at someone's interpretation of you and go, do I do that?  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  It is, it is.  You don't do it.  You don't do it.  I don't do impressions, no.  I'm a sucker for impressions.  I like any impressions.  I like all impressionists.  Oh, I don't do any.  You know.  I do one of mediocrity.  No, you're fantastic.  Kevin Spacey.  I did a play with him recently in London.  And he's a master impersonator.  He does the only William Hurt that I've ever seen.  Oh, wow, really?  Oh, it kills me.  It cracks me up.  Oh, that's great.  I love his William Hurt.  It's fantastic.  Who else is, what's his name?  The actor from Usual Suspects. 
[03:24:30]  Well, I know Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack is really good.  Kevin Pollack is very good.  Duke Coveney did me on SNL, right?  That was a famous one.  I think he did it here when he was in here with us, too.  He did?  Yeah, I think so, yes.  Really?  Was he good?  Yeah, he was pretty goddamn good.  He's pretty good, man.  I love when Elon does.  And I think it's the only time I'll think of the impression when I'm listening to you  because you'll go, but, but, and Elon does this great, and it's a brilliant thing for  him to have caught.  Like, that's what impressionists do.  They catch something that somebody does that you just wouldn't think of when you're doing 
[03:25:00]  the impression, and that's what made it so unique and great.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fun to watch.  I know.  I love it.  It's like Christopher Walken.  There's very few actors who are so interesting that anything they do, you just want to hear  their interpretation of it.  Like, literally, I want to hear how Jeff Goldblum is going to do this or do that, and there's  very few guys.  Nicholson's one of those guys that's interesting enough.  Walk in yourself.  There's very few.  You're so sweet.  I love Chris Walken.  Chris Walken and I have been in, here's a trivia question, four movies together. 
[03:25:30]  We've never had a scene together.  We've come to know, I love to hang around him.  I get a big kick out of him, but we've been in four movies together.  Think of even one movie that you were in that he was in.  I'm not going to cheat.  I love the trivia.  He was not in the Deer Hunter.  You were not in the Deer Hunter.  I was not in the Deer Hunter.  No.  Okay.  King of New York.  I was not in King of New York.  That was a guess, but a question.  I see.  I kind of tried to get an extra answer.  Really?  Oh, shit.  I'd say the judges say, that's a guess. 
[03:26:00]  You've used up one guess.  Yes, yes.  That's a tough one.  Were they earlier films from films we should know, years ago?  Yes.  Walk in was not in Independence Day.  He was not in Jurassic Park.  That's right.  He was not in The Fly.  He was not in Death Wish.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think about it.  Now that I've said it, I know it's four.  I'm trying to remember the four of myself.  I don't remember which ones they were.  Yeah.  I'll go over your bio.  I have your bio.  And don't Google it.  Don't Google it.  We had Donald Sutherland here the other day also.  Oh, I've done two movies with him.  Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 
[03:26:30]  That's correct.  Fantastic.  That movie still holds up.  Yeah.  It still holds up.  It's a great remake.  Well, it was well.  Yeah, thank you so much.  I agree.  Not because of me, but I like Phil Kaufman.  The director is spectacular.  And Donald Sutherland.  Leonard Nimoy was in that.  Yeah, Leonard Nimoy was in that.  I like playing the movie game.  It goes actor, movie, actor, movie.  You know, it's like the Kevin Bacon game.  Right.  You don't have to get back to him.  So name an actor or a movie.  Any actor or any movie.  Gary Oldman.  Okay, now we have to name a movie that he's been in.  I say, you know, I say Batman. 
[03:27:00]  Wasn't he in that last Batman?  Yeah, yes, he was.  Okay, which takes us to...  Christian Bale.  Christian Bale, which takes us to the...  Oh, what's the movie where he lost a lot of weight?  Oh, The Machinist.  The Machinist, which takes us to Jennifer Jason Leigh, which takes us to...  Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Exactly, which takes us to Sean Penn, which takes us to...  Oh, Falcon and the Snowman.  Falcon and the Snowman. 
[03:27:30]  Which takes us to Timothy...  Timothy Hutton.  Hutton, which takes us to one of my favorite movies.  You know who I ran into?  Joe Allen's the other day.  This is what this is.  It's a social lubricant.  As much as anything else.  To be able to go, let me tell you.  Judd Hirsch, who played my father in Independence Day.  I ran into him at Joe Allen's.  So he played, of course, in Ordinary People.  Ordinary People with Timothy Hutton.  And he was in Independence Day with you.  Independence Day, which takes us to Will Smith, which takes us to...  By the way, do you think Judd Hirsch set back the Jewish movement 50 years in that movie? 
[03:28:00]  Certainly not.  David, my son David.  We have also gone on that ad nauseum.  David, my son David.  There was just a delicious touch of humantashen in his part.  It was very beautiful.  This is not Checkmate.  This is not Checkmate.  You'd all be dead if it wasn't for my David.  Yeah, that was the one.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, my goodness.  I just looked at something.  Now I know one of the movies.  Now you know one of the movies.  Where were we?  We were stuck on...  We went to Ordinary People.  We went to Will Smith.  We went up on Will Smith.  Will Smith, you were up to.  That takes us to...  Men in Black.  I love Men in Black.  Tommy Lee Jones.  I love No Country for Old Men.  Yeah, there you go.  We include directors.  We go to the Coen brothers.  A Serious Man.  Speaking of the Jewish people, I loved A Serious Man.  Did you see that?  No.  Ooh.  No?  No?  No.  I highly recommend... 
[03:29:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  When did I become Gunther Tootie?  Ooh.  Ooh.  What's that from?  I don't know.  Car 54?  Where are you?  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  He was like, ooh, ooh.  Yeah.  Which takes us to...  Who was in that, actually?  Car 54?  That's right.  Yeah, the head guy.  Well, he played...  Not the guy, ooh, ooh.  But he played Herman Munster.  His name is...  Yes, Fred Gwynn.  Fred Gwynn, who was also in the Cotton Club.  Oh, wonderful.  Which takes us to Gregory Hines, which takes us to... 
[03:29:30]  History of the World, Part 1.  Sweet, sweet.  Mel Brooks.  Mel Brooks, which takes us to Young Frankenstein.  Oh, I love Young Frankenstein.  You ever see the outtakes of that, and Gene Wilder cracking up?  He goes...  She goes, you haven't touched your food.  He goes, here, here, there.  I touched it, and then he cracks up.  I love Gene Wilder.  Best yell in movie history.  Yeah.  No one yelled better than Gene Wilder.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was a yeller.  Now, he was in, wasn't he, Bonnie and Clyde? 
[03:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Was he in that?  He was the guy who's on...  The guy that was a mortician that took the rock drive with him.  Don't sell that cow.  Don't sell that cow.  And then she finally says, hey, what do you do, by the way?  He says, I'm a mortician.  Faye Dunaway turns around and says, get him out of here.  Get him out.  Get him out.  That was an amazing movie.  That's him.  Faye Dunaway?  You know what he's...  Well, Faye Dunaway.  That takes us to Network.  I love that.  Bill Holden takes to Sunset Boulevard.  Takes us to...  Well, let's to Billy Wilder.  Let's take that director. 
[03:30:30]  The Apartment.  I love The Apartment.  Guess who I ran?  Not to drop another name.  Guess who I ran?  That's why we're doing this.  I ran into Shirley MacLaine on the street the other day.  Yeah.  Who am I?  I said, Shirley, hey.  She said, oh, yes, you're in that seminar.  I'm going to come to see it.  I said, please do.  Shirley MacLaine.  What a nice exchange that was.  I know, right?  Please do.  We don't have exchanges like that.  My perfect Shirley MacLaine impression.  That was great, wasn't it?  I caught something about it.  I don't know why.  I just caught something very good.  That's exactly how she would say, I'm going to come see it. 
[03:31:00]  That's exactly how she would remember it.  What was her name in The Apartment?  I never saw it.  Oh, God.  You've got to be kidding.  Another one.  So put this down.  So put After the Fox.  Put Serious Man.  We've already got three movies for you.  Yes, you have to.  Hold on.  Serious Man and now...  The Apartment.  And now...  What did we say?  The Apartment.  Yes.  No, she plays Miss Kubelik.  Miss Kubelik.  The last line of that movie is, Miss Kubelik, who says this?  Miss Kubelik, I absolutely adore you.  Oh, I'm crying right now.  She says...  I'm a romantic.  I'm a big romantic. 
[03:31:30]  She says, shut up and deal.  Oh, I love that movie.  And then it goes into...  And then it goes into the theme song.  Ta-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.  The Apartment.  Yeah.  I love that movie.  You're like a rain man.  Yeah.  You're a rain man.  That's Goldblum is nuts.  That's the conclusion.  I agree.  He might be tripping.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's fucking nuts.  Yes.  I agree.  I've seen myself through your eyes. 
[03:32:00]  This is the greatest day of my life.  I tell you that Jeff has to go.  But look, one of the movies is Annie Hall.  I just want to say that because Annie Hall...  Chris Walken was in Annie Hall.  That's right.  He was also in The Sentinel.  I'm thinking now.  He's also in Man of the Year.  Yes.  Robin Williams.  Man of the Year.  And one other movie.  Oh, uh, uh, but, I don't know.  It'll come back to me.  Somebody, one of your fine listeners will find that out. 
[03:32:30]  We have to plug Jeff's show, too, because this is why he's here.  And they're telling us in our earpiece that you have by the press.  Yeah, come on.  Come get tickets.  I really, I highly recommend it.  I really did love it.  I'm only there for two months, so run, don't walk.  Come on.  Great.  Jeff Goldblum.  What a blast this has been.  I've been a huge fan over the years.  Yes, this was great.  Do you remember this moment?  Of course not.  That was outside of the theater.  I have an awful photo with Jeff Goldblum.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  And look at, well, this is not one of my better moments, of course.  I have my hair is like Ernie Kovacs in that. 
[03:33:00]  Very good.  But you, you look, look at you.  Look at the fat-faced creep I am.  No, you look very handsome.  I look like one of the things that hatched in Jurassic Park.  Look at that fucking show.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012 continues right now.  Hit, hit, hit, now, now.  Worst of 2012 for the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock.  Mimi Beardsley.  Probably one of the most famous things to happen to the Opie and Anthony show in the year 2012. 
[03:33:30]  Mimi Beardsley was a former intern for John F. Kennedy.  And she put out a tell-all book saying that she lost her virginity to the president.  And then just having an ongoing affair with him.  Some of the people that worked for him.  Maybe his brothers.  We get into detail here about her memoirs and whatnot.  Plus, it leads to Drew Boogie's famous remix of the Mimi Beardsley song,  Oh, Mimi Beardsley, following just after this.  Listen, won't you? 
[03:34:00]  This is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012.  So what's going on with this JFK thing?  I missed this one over the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  When did this come out?  We have to interview this woman.  Huh?  I have to read this book.  She's, uh...  It's probably the only thing that's good in the book, though.  The excerpts were really good.  Well, yeah.  Very sexy.  Very dirty.  A lot of these people that have one moment in time,  and then they have, like, 200 pages of filler in their book.  No, she had a lot more than one moment.  She took a lot of fucking presidential loads.  Oh, this wasn't a one-time thing? 
[03:34:30]  Fuck, dude, I'm so out of this.  Let me get in.  What's going on?  Yeah, she was an intern at the White House.  18-month affair with Jack Kennedy.  Yeah.  She was an intern at the White House?  Yeah.  So Clinton wasn't the first, huh?  Mm-mm.  He made fucking...  Holy shit.  JFK did it right.  Four days into her internship,  she was invited by an aide to go for a midday swim in the White House pool.  Sounds nice.  Yeah, midday swim.  Four days into it, you're all green and ready to go. 
[03:35:00]  Yep.  Where the handsome 45-year-old president swam daily to ease chronic back pain.  JFK slid into the pool and floated up to her.  It's Mimi, isn't it?  He asked.  Yes, sir, she said.  And you're in the press office this summer, right?  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Yes, sir, I am, she said.  That's what her voice probably sounds like.  Oh, gosh.  Lightning had struck. 
[03:35:30]  Later that day, Mimi was invited by Dave Powers,  the president's first friend,  and later the longtime curator of the Kennedy Library in Boston,  to an after-work party.  When she arrived at the White House residence,  Powers and two other young female staffers were waiting.  Powers poured and frequently refilled her glass with daiquiris  until the commander-in-chief arrived.  Get her liquored up.  Get her liquored up.  Yeah, nice.  Just so people know,  they describe her as a slender, golden-haired 19-year-old debutante. 
[03:36:00]  Yes, she's hot.  They got pictures of her up,  and you can tell, even though it's like the early 60s,  she's very hot.  And because of her finishing school,  she was all polished and blue blood.  Blue blood.  She had blue blood connections.  So JFK rolls up.  The president invited her for a personal tour.  She got up expecting the rest of the group to follow.  They know better.  They didn't.  He took her to Mrs. Kennedy's room.  Which, by the way,  this is a president who has shit down. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  I noticed he was moving closer and closer.  I could feel his breath on my neck.  He put his hand on my shoulder.  The next thing she knew,  he was standing above her,  looking directly into her eyes  and guiding her to the edge of the bed.  By the way,  four days into her internship.  Four days.  The day he met her.  And we're not allowed to have it turns  while we finally are?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Well, he didn't kick her in the cunt.  Slowly, he unbuttoned the top of my shirt dress  and touched my breasts. 
[03:37:00]  Yes.  Then he reached up between my legs  and started to pull off my underwear.  I finished unbuttoning my shirt dress  and let it fall off my shoulders.  Oh, man.  Kennedy pulled his pants down  with his shirt still on,  hovered above her on the bed.  Hovered.  He smelled of his cologne, 4711.  Oh.  He paused when he noticed she was resisting.  Holy fuck.  Oh, she resisted a little bit, huh?  Well, you know, little pregame jitters.  Yeah.  Haven't you done this before? 
[03:37:30]  He asked.  No, she said.  Are you okay?  He asked.  Yes, she said.  So he kept going,  this time a little more gently.  Ah, what a guy.  After he finished,  he hitched up his pants and smiled at me  and pointed at the bathroom.  Takes her cherry,  then he hitches his pants up  and points to the toilet.  Points to the fucking bathroom.  Yeah, she was a virgin.  She said when she was done,  she was in shock.  He, on the other hand,  was matter-of-fact 
[03:38:00]  and acted as if he had just occurred  was the most natural thing in the world.  Was to him.  Would you like something to eat?  He asked.  The kitchen's right there.  No, thank you.  No, thank you, Mr. President.  He called a car to pick her up  and take her home.  On the ride home,  it kept echoing in my head,  I'm not a virgin anymore.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, how about you're not a virgin anymore  and Jack Kennedy took your fucking virginity.  The next week,  she was again invited to go swimming. 
[03:38:30]  He barely acknowledged my arrival,  betraying no hint  of what had happened between us  just a few days before.  I couldn't bring myself  to look him in the eye, she writes.  Later, he led her into a different bedroom.  This was the beginning of our affair.  Uh-huh.  Their sex was varied and fun.  He could be seductive and playful at times  and sometimes acted like he had  all the time in the world.  Other times,  he was in no mood to linger.  Ah, he just needed to cum.  They spent an inordinate amount of times 
[03:39:00]  taking baths because,  and he changed his shirt six times a day  because he hated feeling sweaty or grimy.  I think he probably had a B.O. problem.  Oh, wow.  Sweaty Boston drunk.  Just sweating out the fucking whiskey.  But what it was,  he was probably fucking so many different girls.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't want the stink of some other chick's twat on him.  And you know that big, hairy, early 60s bush?  Yeah.  Oh, they didn't even touch it  as far as any kind of manicuring goes.  How do you have time for politics?  Oh, hell of a fuck.  Well, he promised he would call later  under the pseudonym Michael Carter. 
[03:39:30]  Michael Carter.  And then he played a recording  of Nat King Cole's Autumn Leaves.  He made her concentrate on the lyrics.  Even JFK's,  listen to the words.  This is the part that I think  is pertinent to our situation  when Nat says,  I'm fucking you,  keep your mouth shut  or I'll have you killed like Marilyn.  Listen to the lyrics.  Marilyn Monroe was so killed.  So killed by the Kennedys.  It all makes sense now. 
[03:40:00]  You're trying to make me.  She wanted a yap.  As a parting gift,  she gave him a copy of the record  and trimmed the cover.  And Clementica.  Yes, yes.  In a paternity suit.  You didn't say the words  from Autumn Leaves.  But I miss you.  He made her concentrate on the lyrics,  but I miss you most of all,  my darling,  when autumn leaves start to fall.  You're not singing it like  Nat King Cole.  But I miss you most of all,  my darling,  when autumn leaves start to fall.  I mean, you can see  how a white girl can fall for him. 
[03:40:30]  In person.  As a parting gift,  she gave him a copy of the record  and trimmed the cover with leaves  she had collected.  Apparently,  she was a retard girl.  Yeah, really.  He's collecting leaves  on the White House lawn.  What else?  She gave him a macaroni  glued to a paper plate.  He made her fucking stalker patty.  He made her a decoupage.  Yeah, a decoupage.  No, she made him.  Yeah.  Oh, she made him.  This is beautiful.  Throw this in the trash.  You're trying to make me cry.  He told her,  I'm not trying to make you cry,  Mr. President. 
[03:41:00]  She said,  I'm trying to make you remember me.  Within a week of her return  to collage,  she got a call from  Wink Michael Carter.  Michael Carter here.  He asked dozens of questions.  What courses were you taking?  Do you like your teachers?  Are you fucking any Negroes?  Were the girls interesting?  Do you have any friends  who will eat my ass?  What did she have for dinner?  He then invited her  to Washington  when Jackie was away. 
[03:41:30]  Yes, my wife's in Greece  meeting a shipping guru magnate  who shall be fucking  after my brains  are scattered all over  Dealey Plaza.  My wife's making plans  for the future.  A car service would pick her up  and drive her to the airport  where a paid ticket to D.C.  would be waiting for her.  Nice.  Yes.  I have a lot of miles  on Continental. 
[03:42:00]  Upon arrival,  a chauffeur holding a sign up  for Michael Carter  would take her to the White House.  On one visit,  he was in the middle  of the most defining moment  of his presidency,  the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Although historians  have dissected Kennedy's actions,  none were privy  to what he confided to Mimi.  Oh, shit.  He said,  I'd rather my children  red than dead,  he told her.  Wow.  It was a chilling insight.  When the president  wasn't keeping the world 
[03:42:30]  from descending into war,  there was plenty  of wild partying.  One instance  was a raucous Hollywood bash  at Bing Crosby's ranch.  Oh, boo-boo-boo-boo.  They just knocked around  women together.  Yeah.  Ah, you mind if I punch you  in the face?  Hey, Bing,  could you bring your children  in here?  I'd like to knock them  around a little.  I lost some money  on the Sox game.  My fat friend  won't even watch  the Patriots play.  He broke his knee, man.  I was sitting next to him 
[03:43:00]  in the living room  when a handful  of yellow capsules,  most likely amyl nitrate,  commonly known as poppers,  was offered up  by one of the guests.  The president asked me  if I wanted to try the drug  which stimulated the heart  but also purportedly  enhanced sex.  I said no,  but he just went ahead  and popped the capsule  and held it under my nose.  Oh.  He didn't try it himself.  Kennedy had her  doing poppers.  Poppers.  It wasn't her first glimpse  of Kennedy's dark side. 
[03:43:30]  Oh.  He had been guilty  of an even more callous  and unforgivable episode  at the White House  during a noon swim.  So amazing.  Dave Powers had rolled up  his pants  to cool his feet  in the water.  The president swam over  and whispered in my ear,  Mr. Powers looks  a little tense.  Would you take care of it?  Oh my God.  This guy is great.  It was a dare.  This guy?  You mean JFK?  JFK, man.  What a good friend.  Holy fuck. 
[03:44:00]  You know,  it was a dare.  My friend wants to charge me  to have his wife  look at my script.  Look what JFK was doing.  It was a dare.  It was a dare.  But I knew exactly  what he meant.  That was a challenge  to give Dave Powers  oral sex.  I didn't think  the president thought  I'd do it.  But I'm ashamed  to say that I did.  Yeah, you sucked that dick.  The president silently watched.  Wow, what the fuck?  Alfred,  then Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley sucked his dick.  Beardsley.  Said that later 
[03:44:30]  the president apologized  to them both.  Ah, Mimi Beardsley.  She could suck the chrome  off a trailer hitch, Dave.  She'll pull shit  right through your balls  and out of your cock.  That Beardsley girl  really sucks a good dick.  Her name is horrible  and it's a real cock softener.  Wait till Mimi Beardsley  gets your dick in her mouth.  She sucks a good dick.  They call her Mimi Beardsley 
[03:45:00]  because she sucks your pubes  right onto her lower chin.  Looks like she has a beard.  Mimi Beardsley.  Don't say the name  because your cock will wilt  like hot tea  was thrown in your face.  Holy shit.  Jessica Cancer  is a sexier name.  I'd rather have  Marina Oswald  is a better name 
[03:45:30]  than Mimi Beardsley.  I don't like any woman  with a name like  Facial Hair.  Yes.  Sounds like a  Harry Potter character.  You remember  Bessie Hairlip?  She sucks dick  even better than  Bessie Hairlip.  Oh, Diana Prolapse  was a good blowjob giver.  But Mimi Beardsley  really knows  how to pull the cum  out of your balls, Dave.  Trust old Mike Carter here. 
[03:46:00]  Holy fuck.  She'll have your cum  splattered all over.  For years  they'll be analyzing  the tape.  Oh, look,  his cock went back  into the left.  They'll think other people  helped her suck it.  She'll do it so good.  How foretelling is this?  Okay.  One of their last times  together was at the Boston  Democratic fundraiser.  Ted Kennedy,  the president's baby brother  and future leaky-headed man  was in a room with them. 
[03:46:30]  I could see that mischievous  look in his eye.  The bodacious Mimi Beardsley.  Fifty-fifty  where it counts.  This buxonic.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's blow his brains out.  I could see that mischievous  look coming to his eye.  Mimi,  why don't you take care  of my baby brother 
[03:47:00]  and by that I mean  give him a head x-ray.  He could stand  a little relaxation.  Holy fuck.  You've got to be kidding me.  Absolutely not,  Mr. President.  About to be married  to her college sweetheart,  Oh, man.  Tony Fashionstock.  Wait.  Tony Fonstock.  That's his name?  Yeah.  She met Kennedy  for the last time  at the Carlisle Hotel  in Manhattan.  Ah.  Seven days  before his assassination  in Dallas. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  What do you think  happened in that hotel?  hotel room seven days.  You think she went  back one more time?  Oh, of course she met  her in the Carlisle.  Yeah.  That's too, right?  Yeah, he fucked.  I want you to go home  and kiss Mr. Fonsdale  with the stink  of my presidential  cum on your breath.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  I'm just saying your name  so I don't come too fast.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Eat my arse, Mimi Beardsley.  Get little arse hairs 
[03:48:00]  on your face.  Oh, Mimi mustache.  Oh, Mimi mustache.  What a terrible, terrible name.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, is that awful?  It really is.  How the fuck did she  keep this a secret?  Dude, she was pretty, man.  Yeah.  She was cute.  She's got like,  all of her features  are very nice.  What a great profile.  Yeah, she's got  an amazing profile.  What did the body look like?  Did she have some  big heavies or anything? 
[03:48:30]  I don't know.  She was slender.  Are there any pictures  of her?  That's it, huh?  That's the only picture  that exists of her  from back then?  I guarantee you  there's some in her book.  Oh, yeah.  One of her just  sucking fucking Kennedy's dick.  Hopefully, yeah.  I wonder how big his dick was.  I hope she says.  He probably had a massive hog.  No, he was Irish.  He probably had  like five and a half, six.  You think?  Yeah.  Pretend it's a lot bigger.  Make a lot of noise  when I stick it in.  I have to shower again.  I have armpit odor.  And I'm all hot  because I wear a back brace  and it makes me grimy. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, he did wear that brace.  Yes, he did.  That's why he couldn't  slump down when he got shot.  When he was shot,  when you see Kennedy,  he grabs his throat  and he kind of,  there's a very weird motion  he makes in the limo  where he kind of ducks,  it almost looks like  he's leaning on a fence.  Oh, man.  He had a back brace  and he couldn't just collapse in.  Oh, he could have  fucking laid down  in the seat or something  and maybe he wouldn't  have gotten that headshot.  That shot wouldn't have come.  Yeah, some people say  that fucked him up.  Oh, man.  Obviously a different time.  I was shooting Mimi  in the head.  All the shit was going on 
[03:49:30]  and no one was talking.  Yep.  Nobody.  Oswald did to me  exactly what I did to Mimi  except I did more damage.  I blew her wig right off.  Oh, Mimi Beardsdale.  Miss Beardsley.  I love to fuck a face  that's named after  a man's facial hair.  It's like,  reminds me of Dan Haggerty.  My wife's got a big  Greek shipping  magnate cock  buried in her throat 
[03:50:00]  right now.  I bet fucking  Onassis loved  ass play.  Oh, of course he did.  Being Greek.  And his cock was probably  big-headed and fat.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah.  Like a diner cook.  I heard that  Aristotle's cock  was like nine by six  and it like  would really tip left  and he would look at her  and go,  what's that remind you of?  Oh, shit.  Do they explain why  she kept the story secret 
[03:50:30]  for so many fucking years?  I think it's just because  she's a good girl.  How do you live with that story?  It wasn't a TMZ.  It wasn't a TMZ country.  We didn't function that way.  It has been for a while now,  though.  You would assume  this would have came out  before now.  Maybe she didn't want  the hubby to know  she was fucking Kennedy  This is almost 50 years ago.  When they were dating.  When they were still dating  and shit and getting ready  to be married.  Remember I told you  that you were my first  to her husband?  Oh, God, that's right.  She probably was a virgin  and told the guy,  yeah, well, I haven't done that.  I'm waiting for marriage.  And there's fucking Jack  just pounding her fresh pussy.  You would always wonder 
[03:51:00]  why her fucking,  she had like a fucking lipstick  was smeared  and her breath smelled like,  what was it, 4711,  whatever apple cologne he wore?  What kind of foot is,  what is that,  like high karate?  Has it been around since?  Yeah, it's probably,  smells like money.  Kennedy might have  got himself killed  because he was fooling around  with the wrong broad.  Oh, man.  What the fuck?  I bet his bed,  I bet his bed looked like  the fucking seat in the limo.  The fucking cherry.  That's why they cleaned it up  so quickly.  They were just so used to  Kennedy making a mess back there.  They took him to the hospital  and didn't even know 
[03:51:30]  what was wrong.  Yeah, what's the matter?  There's blood in the seat?  Yeah, it happens all the time.  Exactly.  Fucks a lot of virgins back there.  Do we need to clean our hiney?  Yeah, usually they were  wiping shit and intern tears  off that seat.  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Get me a woman  with a horrible name.  Blow my friend Dave  in the pool.  His feet are being cooled off.  He's just dipping his  tootsies in the pool. 
[03:52:00]  If you thought Anthony  Cormier was a piece of shit  as a host,  I'll have you suck  my friend's car.  At least he'll just get drunk  and repeat himself.  I'm having a Super Bowl party.  We're going to karaoke.  Well, you're going to karaoke.  I'm going to have  Mimi Beardsley  eating Robert's asshole  upstairs.  Hey, I'd like you  to jerk my brother off  in the kitchen  of the Ambassador Hotel.  Would you do that for me? 
[03:52:30]  Just jerk him off  into it.  You're going to love  Mimi, Bobby.  You're going to love her.  Oh, my God.  She better have been hot  with that name.  Yeah, it's just terrible.  That name ain't getting her  through any doors.  Just don't repeat  any of the jokes  I've been telling you, Mimi.  He's partial to the Negroes.  Well, fuck.  I think we just took  on book radio.  I'll bet you that they  fucked girls together, 
[03:53:00]  Bobby and Jack.  Yeah, you think they  tag-teamed girls?  Wow.  That would be a biggie, huh?  Me and Florentine,  I pulled trains with Voss.  You'd hope that Jack  and Bobby Kennedy  pulled trains together.  Now you know why  Marilyn Monroe died.  She couldn't keep  her fucking mouth shut  like the rest of them.  You think she was jibber-jabbering  about fucking the Kennedys?  She was probably the one  that said,  I'm coming forward  with this shit.  And she's one that  supposedly had sex  with both of them.  Maybe not at the same time.  She was fucking Bobby  and fucking JFK. 
[03:53:30]  It's absolutely true.  Oh, God.  DiMaggio's just all  pissed off about it.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I bet you he'd punch her.  That's why he abused her.  He'd fucking knock her teeth out  every time they fucking  showed a clip  of Kennedy.  13 days of the missile crisis.  Every time he was up there,  they breathe the same air.  Marilyn got a shiner.  She's cringing  that the State of the Union  is coming on.  She just knows  it's like a sound thrashing  with a Louisville slugger. 
[03:54:00]  Camelot was bullshit.  Yeah.  Old Jolton Joe DiMaggio  just pounding her in the face.  Anything that reminded him  of the fact  that she one time  kissed him  after coming from  JFK's library.  Yeah.  He just aimed  for that mole on her face.  That's why he drank coffee  because he wanted to come  out of his...  He had the taste  of Jack's cum  and he wanted to have  coffee breath  because that...  Long way to go.  Well, it's good, though.  Ah, shit.  They all knew  how to keep secrets  back then. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  Well, if they didn't,  they ended up  in the hotel.  Well, the press  was better then, too.  A supposed drug overdose, huh?  Because none of that stuff  really is news.  Who gives a fuck  if an intern sucks his dick?  Well, one guy from the press  you would think  would have said something.  It's amazing  that you all kept quiet  like they did.  You just didn't do it  back then, man.  We can't even comprehend that  with the world we live in now.  Wow.  Very good, Jimmy.  That's a hell of a story.  I want to read the book.  We've got to interview her, man.  I mean, that's...  That'd be cool.  Yeah, could we get her?  We'd love to talk to her.  Jack's cock size.  You think she'd talk about that? 
[03:55:00]  No, she wouldn't.  She's an older lady,  but I'd squeeze in the question  somehow.  Somehow, yeah.  Just word it in a way  where maybe she, you know...  Hey, did it hurt?  Yeah.  How long after...  I don't know how to say this respectfully.  How long after his head came off  did your vagina finally get wet again?  Like, every time you were touched  after that,  like, whenever your husband  would rub your clit,  would you just think of that shot  ringing out behind the  Stemmins freeway sign? 
[03:55:30]  Do you imagine?  She's fucking a guy for 18 months,  the best looking,  most powerful guy on the planet,  and then just to see a murdered lady.  Oh, they didn't see it for five years.  The American public didn't see  the Secruder tape  until probably 68.  When she was 19,  she wasn't telling all her friends?  Yeah.  You gotta think she was yakking.  I guarantee you  there's one or two she told.  And no one believed her, probably.  Well, they just knew better  than the...  They kept their mouth shut.  Yeah, yeah.  And once he got shot,  you just...  Who's that?  Marilyn Monroe and who?  And Reagan.  That's Reagan.  Oh, does Reagan fuck you, too? 
[03:56:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Marilyn, pull down those panties!  Why else would she be there?  If you think about it.  The fucking starts in five minutes.  Years.  And I pulled up my balls  and they brushed the face of Marilyn.  See, everything he did later,  he just said earlier to Marilyn,  wish I could do Reagan.  Years.  That was a perfect Reagan.  People are like,  you're not gonna address  Jimmy's awful Boston accent?  Are you kidding me?  It's a great Boston accent.  It sounds just like him. 
[03:56:30]  What's wrong with you?  Close your eyes.  You'd think it was him.  Fucking perfect.  Yeah.  Shaw.  Shaw.  What was wrong with that accent?  That's gotta be the best  of what's in the book, though.  I can't imagine  there's anything else in the book.  I could read just a lot of lead-up and shit.  Any details about that  I want to read, though.  I would like to hear  about the Beardsley childhood,  what it was like  growing up in the Beardsley house.  Yeah, what was it like?  You think it starts  with all that bullshit?  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  I was young,  born to the Beardsley family.  Her path to the White House?  Yes.  How she got there. 
[03:57:00]  Snoresville.  Her dumb fucking boyfriend,  Tony, that cuck.  Yeah.  Presidential cuck.  Yeah.  You know she used that  in an argument.  Ah, yeah.  We were talking about it  behind the scenes, but...  Well, I fucked the president.  Right.  They probably had  some kind of heated argument  and she fucking broke  that doozy out.  Yeah.  Broke that one out.  God damn.  Jack Kennedy.  The more I hear about him,  the more I just love him.  Oh, what a great guy.  He's better red than dead.  Yeah.  He's ready to give up.  If he's getting that done 
[03:57:30]  without showing any nerves,  you gotta think  he was knocking them back  left and right.  And he's president  during a pretty tumultuous time  in history,  and he's there  just knocking them down,  setting them up  and knocking them down.  Which proves the time  wasn't that tumultuous.  Maybe.  That's what I'm thinking.  Ah, the commies.  Who gives a shit?  Bring me a virgin.  He had all that shit  under control in the end.  Yeah.  No, I bet you  he knew exactly  what the fuck he was doing.  It was probably tumultuous  because of what he was doing.  They're like,  Mr. President,  we've been telling you  for two weeks  about these fucking 
[03:58:00]  Russian ships in the ocean.  Well, how close are they  to Cuba?  Oh, no, I forgot about that.  Mimi Beardsley  had two fingers  in my asshole.  She said there was  fecal matter  in her fingernails.  Oh, you did mention that.  I forgot about it.  It's Irish now.  It's Irish.  I love it.  Wait, how close  are the boats  to Cuba?  Oh, fuck.  My dick smells  like Mimi Beardsley.  If you launch  an attack at us,  I will aim  directly at Russia.  All right, thank you. 
[03:58:30]  Good night.  Is Mimi in the car?  I'd like my asshole licked.  You think he'd just  let it get closer and closer?  He forgot about it.  He didn't know.  He's like,  oh, I think I got  a little more time here.  Yeah.  Get it in one more time.  Yeah.  That's why he didn't  fucking put,  that's why there was  no fucking bubble top  in Dallas.  I want to text Mimi  and I can't text it  with the bubble tops.  I get no service  in Dallas.  I want to send  a mimeograph  to Mimi  while I'm driving.  A mimeograph.  Yeah, a mimeograph  to Mimi Beardsley. 
[03:59:00]  Are you sure  he didn't say  better dead than red?  A lot of people  are saying that.  No, he didn't say  better red than red.  That's why there was  a chilling insight.  Yeah, because it was,  all right.  Because publicly  he was saying  he was just bluffing.  I'd rather see them  red than dead.  If the Rooshkis knew  that he wasn't going to  really do this whole,  you know,  mutual destruction thing.  Mimi.  Yeah.  Their children breathe  the same air  as our children,  which smells  a lot of times  like my cologne 
[03:59:30]  mixed with semen  and virgin blood  on the sheets.  A little speck of copper  with cum all over it.  That's what it smells like.  Russian children  will breathe that in.  Ich benign stinky dick.  I believe in this,  Dakar.  We will go to the moon  and I will be blown  by Mimi Beardsley  and do those other things.  We'll either go to the moon  or I'll put my penis 
[04:00:00]  in some nice ass cheeks  while a girl is mooning  in the pool.  Could you finger Dave  Powers, asshole, please?  He said the socks lost.  He's a little tense.  He's a little tense.  I would offer a massage,  but I know I could get you  to suck his penis.  Weren't you a virgin Tuesday?  Now I'm pimping you out.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  He goes from virginity  and purity  to sucking the president's pal.  I know you've only had sex  for two days, 
[04:00:30]  but would you mind  jerking off,  Mr. Krooschev?  We're really talking  about a lot here.  Holy fucking A.  Yeah, could you gangbang  my cabinet?  I know you were a virgin,  but...  I'd like you to use your lips  on Medgar Evers.  He's acting like  a real troublemaker.  Could you get that Dr. King  to stop marching  all over the place? 
[04:01:00]  He's tying up traffic.  Holy shit.  Suck my brother Teddy's cock.  Pull his pants off.  They still might be  a little damp.  He had a little incident,  you know.  He's tense.  Teddy wants to come  in your mouth,  but don't let him  drive you home.  I'll send the car for you.  Yes.  And don't mention  my retarded sister  while you're sucking his cock.  That's a real sensitive point.  Don't mention 
[04:01:30]  the tart in the basement.  You can fuck me,  you can relieve  Teddy's stress,  but don't mention  Dumbella downstairs.  It's a real mood killer.  Mimi Beardsley.  Don't mention  the family secret  that somebody was drunk  with a baby in the womb  and popped out an idiot.  She's in her home  far, far away.  Oh, shit. 
[04:02:00]  Here, have some,  have a drink  that my father  brought in illegally.  Have some bootlegged alcohol.  You're a virgin, aren't you?  Smell these poppers.  Homosexuals will be doing it  through holes in the wall.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Here you go.  This is what George Michael does.  I don't know who he is either.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Haven't you done this before?  Mimi Beardsley. 
[04:02:30]  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, my dick smells like Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Are you fucking any Negroes?  Oh.  Do you have any friends  who'll eat my ass?  Have some bootlegged alcohol. 
[04:03:00]  Oh.  You're a virgin, aren't you?  Smell these poppers.  Her name is horrible.  It's a real cock softener.  Why don't you take care  of my baby brother?  Oh, look.  His cock went back  into the left.  Back into the left.  His cock went back  into the left.  Back into the left.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Haven't you done this before? 
[04:03:30]  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, my dick snubs like Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  His cock went back into the left. 
[04:04:00]  Back into the left.  His cock went back into the left.  His cock went back into the left.  Back into the left.  His cock went back into the left.  Back into the left.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Haven't you done this before? 
[04:04:30]  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, my dick snubs like Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Yeah, this is Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012. 
[04:05:30]  Worst of 2012, Opie and Anthony Show.  My name is Z-Rock.  We just had legendary basketball player and actor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  He was just on the show promoting his new book, and we thought everything went great,  but there was some stuff behind the scenes during the interview that was making it very uncomfortable for the staff.  Kareem's publicist was not liking the fact that we were not just talking about the book only.  We were talking about him as a person, getting to know him, talking about his infamous basketball career, 
[04:06:00]  but she just wanted to talk about the book and was getting really upset that that's not what we were doing.  So she wanted to redirect the conversation that the hosts were having.  We weren't going to allow it.  We discussed everything right here, and Kevin Smith is also there chiming in, and here it is.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012.  We got Kevin Smith in studio.  Got a dummy on Twitter, or a dummy on incident and feedback.  He writes, hey, both. 
[04:06:30]  He goes, Kevin Smith's for what, 20 minutes now?  Kareem in studio?  I mean, come on, dude.  I know you don't care anymore, but this is crazy.  I was just getting into Kevin Smith.  He hasn't been on in a long time.  What an asshole.  What an idiot that's right here.  Kevin's mic has to be on.  What an idiot.  Can I join?  Of course, Kevin came in at 8, and we had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at 8.30, so you've got  to stop everything to talk to Kareem for a while, and then knowing we're going to go  back to Kevin.  You always step aside for a legend.  You know what I'm saying?  That man's a living legend.  And we were just talking about in the break, this is a dude who, when you watch him, he has 
[04:07:00]  the quiet grace of one of the lucky few whose dream came true beyond measure, and then  he eventually had to put it down and start a whole new life.  You know, you always look at people that are like, oh, they wanted to do this, and they  got it, but then they say that athletes and beautiful women die two deaths.  And, you know, sooner or later, that thing that fuels you, you've got to give up.  So it's amazing to watch a dude sit there with quiet statesmen like Grace, know that  he achieved his dream and eventually had to put it on his shelf. 
[04:07:30]  His amazing career ended at 42.  Yeah.  That is so fucking young, you start realizing when you get a little older.  He's been out for 20 years.  And when he talked about it, he was playing, that's why I was asking him, what grade did  you start playing?  Fourth grade.  He says he's fourth grade.  Fourth grade.  And like, you know, who knows when the dreams of playing pro starts setting in?  Oh, no.  By ninth grade, I read a lot on Lou Alcindor when he was Lou Alcindor back then.  That's what I wanted to ask, too.  When I was a kid, I had these little, like, I don't know what it was called.  It was this, like, I think Kenner or Hasbro made it, or Mattel.  It looked like a walkie-talkie. 
[04:08:00]  It was brown.  And it had a back pocket, and you put these little records into it.  And the records had pictures on them, and there was one for Bobby Orr, and there was  one for a basketball player named Lou Alcindor.  And you'd put these in, and they would play, and you would listen, kind of like a scene,  and say, to a pre-recorded sports story of, like, a minute long that was like, Lou Alcindor!  And they gave you a complete biography, and then it would end with, Lou Alcindor!  And you would hear the crowd go, wow!  I totally...  On a little record.  Do you have a bare recollection of that toy? 
[04:08:30]  Yes!  I haven't thought about that forever, but yes.  Now I need to know the name of that.  I had that.  A primitive iPod.  Yeah, yeah.  That only did sports.  One-minute sports segments.  But that was, I mean, you step aside for living legend like that.  That dude's like Stan Lee.  Like, one of these people, it's just like, he's been here...  How old did you say he was?  He's 64.  Okay, 64.  He's seen a lot of history, and he's been living history.  He stands there before he was living history.  By the time he was in ninth grade, they pretty much knew he was going to be a pro basketball  player for real. 
[04:09:00]  That's...  They knew that early.  Right.  With him.  So...  Oh, yeah.  And then at 42, you have to say goodbye and then figure out the rest of your life.  This is my one observation from being in the room with him.  Yeah.  He does not...  He's over hearing how tall he is.  I know.  Oh, you can pick that up in a second.  He never wants to hear somebody be like, what's the weather like, or Jesus, you're tall, or  what the...  Oh, man.  He's just like, I'm 64.  I've been hearing this since I was nine.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm tall.  Yeah.  You gotta think if he's 64, he's lost a couple inches. 
[04:09:30]  And he almost hit the ceiling in here.  Not only does he not look like he didn't lose, we said it in front of him, he fucking looks  ageless.  I know.  That is true.  He's surreal looking in person.  Like, when he comes in, you feel like there's a man being carried in on something.  Yeah.  Like, he's that large.  I said it looked like the guy from the Close Encounter ship.  Yeah.  The last guy that comes out, bang!  I was going for the quiet grace of Chewy.  Well, that...  Oh, okay.  He had a real Chewy-like statesmanship.  Was it...  Pat from Monaki, was it the GAF or the GAF Viewmaster? 
[04:10:00]  It wasn't the...  I remember the GAF or the GAF Viewmaster, but that was more of a visual-oriented toy that you  looked into, some of the GAFs could project.  This was strictly, I believe it was Mattel, hard plastic, brown and, like, dark orange  in color.  It had a speaker in the front.  I forget what the design was.  It had this push-button thing on the side that was half a white disc of some sort.  You would push it in, and that would play the record inside. 
[04:10:30]  And it just...  It was just...  The one I had, just sports stories.  Someone's saying sports talk by Topps, but...  That's not it.  Yeah, all right.  Well, I think we've got to go back to the Kareem thing.  Go ahead.  I've been thinking about it a little bit.  It's interesting.  Go ahead.  I think you can do it without bashing anybody.  Kenny ran in here and said that Kareem was getting a talking to, and then we all looked  down the hall, and he was.  He was getting a talking to right down the hall by...  That was a lambasting from what I saw.  By...  I guess it's a PR person.  Publishment.  Yeah.  I'm thinking publishers.  The way these dudes reacted, apparently, he would, like, the color went out of Opie's 
[04:11:00]  face.  He was just like, Kareem's getting yelled at.  It was fucked up.  He was standing in the hall.  No one yells at Kareem.  And there was yelling going on.  And then I realized, wait, he could take care of himself.  He doesn't need my shit.  But here's some fucking...  Can he take care of himself?  He's a gentle soul.  That's the thing.  Yeah, that's true.  When you talk to him, he's kind of like, I don't want no fuss of us.  Or, you know, you could see him taking it rather than being like, shut up.  Is that her right there?  No.  Oh, because now...  That's Roland.  He must like it, though, because she...  I think she'd been with him for a while, so she must do...  Kenny said something.  Roland said something.  What was she dressing him down about?  Roland told me, you need to get Spencer on the air. 
[04:11:30]  Supposedly, she was banned from this building.  She's like a problem.  Where's Kenny and where's Roland?  She was very...  I think she was annoyed at the line of questions, which she doesn't understand.  And this is just...  But I think as a publicist, she should shut up.  We're talking to Kareem about the Skyhook.  And he was great.  The Skyhook and martial arts and all this stuff.  Which, P.S., when that happened, he lit up.  He was happy to talk about it.  You could sit there and listen to him.  And he was very eloquent on everything. 
[04:12:00]  But when he talked about the Skyhook, there was a certain energy there that hadn't been  present in the entire interview.  Because he's like, oh, great.  Yeah.  I like talking about this.  It was his passion.  Yes.  What PR people don't understand is, of course, we're going to get to the new project.  But if you just talk about the new project the whole time, you're going to lose listeners.  So what you try to do is we have to make it interesting for our audience.  We don't want to lose them.  And then that means you're going to have more people listening about the book.  And also, logically, it makes sense, right?  You can't just talk about the book for 20 minutes.  It's a kid's book. 
[04:12:30]  Now, are there plenty of parents out there that would buy it?  Honestly, yeah.  But we're also marketing this to people who are like me.  I'm not a parent.  But you know what?  I would absolutely go and buy this to have Kareem sign it.  I bought books I wasn't going to read.  Henry Winkler.  The first time I met Henry Winkler, I bought his book just so he would sign it.  It's a kid's book.  A lot of people do that because they like the artist or they like the person.  And so it's like we're also interviewing you for his fans who will go out and buy the fucking books.  And somebody's sitting there listening to that Skyhook story is just like, oh, my God. 
[04:13:00]  I remember like if you're old enough and you've got some kids, you're going, I remember watching him do that.  I like listening to him talk about that.  You're more inclined to jump on Amazon and buy the book.  Of course.  Publicists never quite understand.  They don't.  This is something I've always believed in.  You come in, the less you talk about what you're quote unquote there to promote, the better it is for it.  All you have to do, your only job is to go in there and be interesting.  Because if you're interesting, then they'll start looking you up and whatnot.  But when you go in pushing something down their throats, people are immediately like I'm being sold. 
[04:13:30]  Turned off.  Yeah, yeah.  I watched the interview you guys did with Paris Hilton.  She was a delight.  Oh, my God.  It was painful.  And it's just like in this transaction, nobody wins.  You guys won because it's a good video.  But nobody.  She don't win.  And nobody's going to buy that book when she sits there on a truck.  Her reality show.  And it got knocked off the air.  It was the reality show.  Did you get to the part of Daryl Hammond's book about Paris Hilton?  Yes, where she was the biggest twat who hosted SNL.  She was the biggest twat that ever hosted SNL.  Didn't want to meet with the writers.  Like these Emmy award winning writers.  I guess the process with SNL.  You're the host. 
[04:14:00]  You come in.  And now you go from office to office.  And they got these ideas.  And they have won all sorts of awards.  They're trying to make you look good.  And Daryl Hammond overheard her saying, how many more of these do I have to do?  How many more of these do I have to go to you?  She really is the vapid cunt that you think she's going to be.  I hate to say that.  I wish she wasn't.  I watched every minute of that video because you were fucking trying, dude.  It was valiant how much you were putting into it.  Because it would have been so easy within the first minute to just be like, fuck this.  And start cutting and running. 
[04:14:30]  We were trying to be on our best behavior.  Because she's an easy target.  It doesn't take much to berate Paris Hilton.  So I'm like, fuck it.  Let's give her a real interview.  Be nice to her.  Don't be what she expects.  She walked into the room and she expected a bunch of dudes being like, whoo, whoo, whoo.  She sucked, dude.  She sucked.  She sucked.  She gave nothing.  Let's get back to the current day.  Did you have a thought?  I'm sorry.  Kareem, on the other hand, gave something in regards to the doc.  It was interesting in regards to the book.  But no doubt, when he started talking about the Skyhook, he was into it. 
[04:15:00]  He lit up.  He lit up.  But you also notice he doesn't like talking about his height.  Except very true.  I mean, look, he wasn't a tough man to read by any stretch of the imagination.  Stay away from the height.  Let's talk about the Skyhook.  But it's hard not to say something.  Kenny, what happened?  Don't hold back.  What did you hear after the interview?  Nothing.  I was just taken aback of the way that lady took Kareem aside and was like...  She was yelling at him, right?  Yelling at him.  Scolding him.  You don't talk about the Skyhook. 
[04:15:30]  You don't talk about 4th grade.  All you talk about is the book.  That's what we're here to promote is the book.  I think that's bad advice.  That's very bad.  Terrible advice.  That's worse advice than, yes, Adolf, you have a good idea to go into Germany and it's cold out.  I meant to say, fuck it, Russia.  God damn history jokes.  I always blow them.  But it was the way she was saying it.  She was yelling at him.  Eric's got a better story than me.  Eric, what happened?  I'm sorry.  I was just watching him and see if he was getting yelled at again as he came out of Shave 45.  Where are they now? 
[04:16:00]  They're in the hallway right here next to us.  I just want to look at him.  What is she doing?  She's on the phone.  There he is.  And she's looking over the legal agreement.  What?  That's smart.  Before they sign it, she wants to make sure.  She should be very happy, though, because his segment turned into almost a double segment.  He's not even here.  He's got some ink.  Literally, it is hard.  What a class act.  An unbelievable class act.  He was great.  He didn't mind talking about any of that stuff.  Eric, you have a story, though?  What did she do to you?  She was in there with you?  Yeah.  And she was bitching and complaining the second she walked in here. 
[04:16:30]  You were only three minutes into the interview.  Right.  And she was saying, they're past seven minutes already.  We've got to wrap this up.  And to the credit of the blonde publicist that was here, who was trying to control the brunette publicist,  she was saying, they just started talking.  We've got time.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, boy.  And then when, again, you brought up him in junior high, the skyhooks, all the stuff that  wasn't book-centric.  She kept going, why are they talking about this?  Why is he talking about that?  And then she started saying, I need to speak to every host from the next interviews that 
[04:17:00]  we do to let them know what they can and can't talk about.  Oh, yeah.  Hosts love that, by the way.  Please get her in here.  Oh, do hosts love that?  With respect for him, I won't yell at her because for whatever reason, he has her.  And she didn't yell at us.  Well, he didn't look happy after the dress down.  Yeah, I mean, whatever.  If that says he wants to conduct business, fine.  But in my perspective, you let him go in and talk to what makes him happiest.  Right.  And that'll sell whatever you're trying to sell.  I think that he probably doesn't understand. 
[04:17:30]  Look, she just gave us a look.  He doesn't understand probably what a bad job she's doing for him in that way.  Roland's handling something.  Either that or he wants a pit bull, too.  Maybe.  Somebody would go in and be like, get me in and out.  Roland, what do you know about this lady?  She's intense.  Really?  What's going on?  She's the worst.  Oh, that was such a great interview in there.  So it's such a difference.  She just said that?  Get her in here.  What, on the other interview?  Please get her.  No.  At one point.  Is that like we mentioned AIDS and the Magic Johnson? 
[04:18:00]  No, we gave a better interview.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I don't know what Sway's in here.  She walked out of the Sway interview saying like, that was so much better.  Why?  Because was it all about the book?  What?  No.  Probably not.  It was probably because it was a black host interviewing him about black.  But again.  It was short.  It was very short.  But that's a publicist giving terrible advice.  Yeah.  Because again, if you don't understand that we have a really large audience.  And our audience would like to hear from Kareem.  And sure, we mentioned the book.  He also wanted that other thing plugged.  And I was happy to plug that. 
[04:18:30]  And I actually saw it.  Yeah.  I want a copy of that.  Anyone have a copy of that?  Do you have a copy of that?  I saw my copy.  Sure.  Worst publicist ever?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's rough.  Because that's her only client's Kareem.  And what?  She got banned from the building last time or something you were telling me?  Yeah, they threw her out.  They threw her out for what?  She barged in for interviews.  Yeah, she was getting ready to start coming in here.  If anything has a question.  Oh, I wish she came in.  She would have barged in.  God, I wish she came in.  I felt bad because I just let her in there with Eric so she could torture Eric.  I had to scream and get Roland in here to run interference on this lady because she was 
[04:19:00]  leaning over the board here.  And when we have to wrap up, the publicist said, we have five minutes, whatever.  I tell you guys in your headphones, hey, we have five minutes or he has to go.  She kept saying, well, why aren't they wrapping up?  Jimmy would ask another question and she'd start losing her shit.  And then Jimmy would keep talking again.  They're not plugging the book.  Why does he keep going on about this?  I think this is around the time when you started talking about the Skyhook.  And she goes, you need to tell them.  So I'm pretending I'm hitting the buttons that I'm telling you guys in the headphones. 
[04:19:30]  And I kept telling her.  I'm like, I don't know what you want me to do.  I told them.  They know.  And she's sitting there and she goes, well, what are we going to do?  The hosts aren't listening to you.  And I said, there's nothing we can do.  She wants to barge in here.  She goes, well, how do we go in there and stop this?  I go, we don't.  What are we doing?  Beating them up?  E-Rock.  That's where you failed.  You should have let her come in, man.  You know that would have been good.  No, my picture wouldn't have got signed up.  You know that would have been good.  At that point, you go, look, I can't stop them. 
[04:20:00]  You better get in there.  This was too big a guest for you guys.  We got what we needed.  If it was somebody of lesser status, I wouldn't have cared.  Next time Karen would come in.  But this was too big and I wasn't going to let her in.  Let her come in.  Do you see, Paris Hilton's publicist was also awful.  She didn't realize that we were really nice to Paris.  We had a good time with Kareem.  We tried.  It's amazing what pegs publicists in general as a rule can be.  Your job is not to be the jealous center of attention. 
[04:20:30]  Your job is to represent your client and guide your client in a smart way to promote their product and to promote them.  It's not to be the spoiled star yourself because you're not the interesting one.  Right.  But which, again, to the flip side, a lot of people stand behind their people.  They want pit bulls.  You're right.  They can be like, you beat a bad guy.  I don't want to beat a bad guy.  And you sit there and shrug like, I would love to stay.  Yeah, like, hey, man, I'm on a tight schedule.  I understand that.  But getting yelled at in the hallway. 
[04:21:00]  That one I've never seen in a million years.  It's a pit bull who gives bad advice.  That's the problem.  Well, Kareem will figure that shit out.  He's smart enough to figure it out in the end.  Is Spencer around for his story?  He had to get another guess.  Okay.  And I love Twitter.  Queen Elizabeth on Twitter, who, you know, I've seen her tweets and I like her.  Just the cluelessness of this tweet.  I got blocked by Paris Hilton because I wished her uncle, Nikki Hilton, was alive and would kick out her uterus.  And then the hashtag is sensitive content.  Like, she doesn't understand why Paris Hilton would block her for that. 
[04:21:30]  Why would I get blocked?  Now, Roland.  Yes.  This publicist, did she inform Sway what he can and cannot talk about?  Because I heard when she got Kareem out of here, she was going to tell all the rest of the hosts that are doing interviews what they can and can't talk about.  Oh, she was in there blabbering.  She was.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'd love to hear what she says.  Don't make sure to promote the book and don't forget that he's with Hillary Clinton. 
[04:22:00]  Don't forget that.  And he's like, yeah.  Yeah, we got all that out.  You dumb fuck.  Of course we did.  It was the stupidest stuff that she was getting mad at.  You talking about him in junior high.  This was nothing offensive or detract from the interview.  And that's what she started.  It's all interesting stuff we asked.  You're talking about a guy that in ninth grade, they pretty much knew was going to be in the NBA.  And that you weren't plugging enough.  The blonde publicist kept saying, Jimmy just did the plug.  You're yelling and not even listening to what's going on.  And Jimmy will plug.  And she said, Jim will plug it again at the end of the interview, which you did. 
[04:22:30]  I know how to plug.  And I know the value of plug.  And I was happy to do it.  But it doesn't serve him or the audience well to every two seconds go, so you're a basketball.  Oh, the book.  Oh, the book.  Nobody wants to just hear.  That's kind of tired.  About, you know what I mean?  You have to mix it up with a real interview.  Yeah, of course.  The blonde said they have to work it in.  They have to humanize the interview.  Yeah, exactly.  Because we're not doing a five-minute TV spot.  Get them on QVC if you want that shit. 
[04:23:00]  Radio is different than television.  Book radio.  The soul of a person is going to sell far more of whatever that person wants to sell  than just sitting there, empty formalism, saying, I have a book.  I have this video.  These are where you can get them and whatnot.  You've got to get to know somebody a little bit, especially in this tribe before you buy  a culture, man.  Most people are like, I want to be a little invested in this guy before I put my hard-earned  money up.  Not everyone has a lot of spending cash right now.  So hearing about his life, going to the place of like, let's talk about something that  is you and only you, a signature that has lasted in sport long after you've been there, 
[04:23:30]  is the smart fucking play.  Anybody that doesn't see that, not good at their fucking job.  I don't think she knows who she's handling.  Thanks, Kevin.  It's like fucked up.  But he's completely right.  Yeah, of course.  That is exactly what it is.  You got something?  Well, Spencer's there.  So I was asking Santa to grab Spencer.  Because I saw you get all excited.  Spencer!  Spencer!  They can't hear us out there.  Thanks for the call there, sir.  Let's get Tony in Cleveland.  Hey, how's it going this morning, guys? 
[04:24:00]  Hey, hey.  All right, Tony.  What do you got?  I don't want to lose Spencer.  I saw a...  Oh, you want to come on the air?  No, I'm getting the story, though.  Oh, all right.  All right.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Tony.  Hey, I saw a documentary years ago about the whole UCLA run and Wooden and all that.  And they talked about Kareem.  When he first got to UCLA, he grew some fire from the press because he had made some comments  about, you know, the 68 Olympics with the black fists in the air and with all the stuff  that was going on with the Vietnam War. 
[04:24:30]  And it was barely anything he said.  He just, you know, they asked him.  He basically said that, you know, he thought those guys were right for putting their fists  in the air and all this.  And then next thing you know, it got blown in that he's a, you know, a black panther and  all this.  So John Wooden pulled him aside and said, look, you are such a...  There's such a huge spotlight on you.  Everything you say is going to be twisted.  So ever since then, he's kind of shied away from the press and everybody labeled him as,  you know, being an asshole and all this.  Well, after they retired, they come to him and, you know, that's when, you know, the whole 
[04:25:00]  pot thing was going on and the MPA and they brought it up to him.  And then he said, well, you know, I smoked pot, what's the big deal?  Yeah, I got to tell you, we all heard those stories over the years.  We got, we were lucky enough to talk to him for what, maybe a half hour?  I saw a really nice, sweet guy.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, he was very pleasant.  Like, I was expecting a guy that would be a little, you know, fucking intimidating.  Abressive?  Yeah, besides his height, just an intimidating individual.  He wasn't that at all.  I wanted to tell him that I do the skyhook a lot, but without the ball. 
[04:25:30]  I just, I just, I just walk around making the skyhook motion.  Sam, you got the story from Spencer?  Yeah.  What's up, man?  We're going back to Kareem's publicist who pretty much gave him a talking to after our interview.  Yeah, what's up?  He was yelling at him in the hallway.  By the way, most people thought it was a really good interview, so.  What's up?  What are you going to do?  He, last time he was here, he was doing Mad Dog.  Okay.  And she didn't know who Mad Dog was.  Oh, God.  And they were talking about the Lakers and stuff, obviously, on Mad Dog Sports.  Yeah.  And I guess he was promoting another book or something.  I'm not sure what he was, maybe the documentary when it came out. 
[04:26:00]  He was promoting the documentary on the Rens.  My teeth are clenched.  Go ahead.  And she started freaking out at Spencer, saying, I'm going to go in there and stop this.  They're not, they're talking about basketball.  They're not talking about the movie.  He's not just plugging the movie.  He's talking about his, we're not here to talk about the Lakers.  And Spencer has to go, no, no, no, you can't go in.  Just let this one go.  And the other ones will be blah, blah, blah.  And she goes, all right.  And then they went to do Covino and Rich next.  And two minutes into the interview, when they talked about the Lakers, instead of just plug, plug, plug, plug, she said, I'm going in there this time. 
[04:26:30]  And Spencer had to stand in front of the door and say, you're going to have to physically remove me.  He then had to get, call his boss and call the head of security and say, we need to throw this lady out of the building.  Wow.  He said it was the most difficult afternoon of his professional life.  And he said, this booking, and Spencer said, she's banned from the building.  And this morning, when this booking was made, Spencer said, yes, you know, of course we'll take Kareem, but she can't come with him. 
[04:27:00]  Absolutely not.  And so at 6 a.m., they say, she's going to come with him.  She'll be on her best behavior.  And Spencer says, absolutely not.  She can't come in the building.  And they said, well, we're going to cancel him from O&A and from Sway if she can't come in the building.  Oh, boy.  So that's why.  That's the only reason she was out here.  Oh, okay.  Because he would have canceled her.  He would have let him cancel.  Yeah, because he didn't want to lose Kareem for you guys or for Sway.  No, that was cool.  That was very cool with him for Sway. 
[04:27:30]  But again, that's her.  So I'm here to protect you.  But how embarrassing for him that his publicist is doing him a disservice.  He's on Mad Dog's show, and she doesn't want him to talk about sports.  Yeah, that's what Mad Dog does.  I would love to write him an email.  If I could get Kareem's email, I don't know how to get it.  You can go hit him on Twitter.  Hit him on Twitter.  That's true.  What can you say in 140 characters?  We would do it in 10.  But do 10 tweets.  That's 1,400.  Yeah, there you go.  And then it'll be noticed, and it'll get to his attention. 
[04:28:00]  If you go bang, bang, bang, you've got enough followers, they'll retweet it to him.  Yeah, but I don't want them saying she's a cunt.  I really feel bad.  No, but just they'll retweet you.  They'll retweet what you write.  That this great, great, fucking, he's an ambassador, a cultural ambassador.  And he has to stand there and be chewed out for talking about what made, look, people didn't care about his karate movies.  They wanted to see him play basketball, and now he's a celebrity because of it.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Publicist.  Hey.  All these years, it's just dumb little noises. 
[04:28:30]  Ha-ha, noises.  Ha-ha, noises.  Make sure all the tones aren't there.  Yeah, you've got to feel it out.  Make sure all the tones aren't there.  Yeah, you've got to feel it out.  Get some lows, get some highs, get some lows, get some highs, get some lows, get some highs, get some lows, get some highs. 
[04:29:00]  Ha, ha, ha, noises  Ha, ha, noises 
[04:29:30]  Yep, yep, ha, ha, noises  Yep, yep, ha, ha, noises  How we doing this morning  Let's do it  How we doing this morning  Let's do it 
[04:30:00]  Let's do it  Let's do it  All right, that's it for the worst of 2012. </pre>
