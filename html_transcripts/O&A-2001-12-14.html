<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts humorously lamenting their plummeting ratings in Washington D.C., having fallen from #1 to #14 and even winning a "worst radio show" online poll. They self-deprecatingly compared their situation to past low ratings in New York and other low-rated personalities like the Greaseman, while also noting a listener's surprising addiction to the show despite initial dislike.  The conversation then shifted to the Osama bin Laden video, with the hosts and callers expressing outrage and resorting to violent and offensive suggestions for dealing with bin Laden.  The hosts expressed skepticism towards Arab-American claims that the tape was fake, and the discussion veered into a critique of the American legal system, using the O.J. Simpson trial as a prime example of legal loopholes.  

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a bizarre, chaotic outdoor contest involving men attempting to fill water balloons with urine,  with the hosts providing a running commentary filled with vulgar descriptions of the contestants' actions and the various mishaps, including balloon ruptures and one contestant vomiting.  This segment was interspersed with studio appearances by comedian guests Brian Regan and his brother Dennis, along with a brief, awkward introduction of Luciana ("Party Girl 56"), a friend of the Reigans. The hosts repeatedly made suggestive and crude remarks towards Luciana, referencing her online presence and alleged relationship with Jim Norton.  The Reigans promoted their upcoming shows at Caroline's Comedy Club, their attempts often interrupted by the hosts' banter and the unfolding chaos of the water balloon contest.  The hosts also aired a fake commercial for a "Homeless for the Holidays" CD and attempted to play a song by Anthony's brother, "Brother Joe," but encountered technical difficulties.  A fake Jim Norton doll commercial was also mentioned.  They briefly discussed Regan's upcoming appearance on Letterman and engaged in a humorous improv bit with him and a caller.  Further adding to the chaos, strippers were brought in during the contest, leading to further disruptions and a contestant's balloon exploding.  "The Retarded Laverne and Shirley," a comedic duo, joined the studio, discussing their divorce and possible future appearances on the show.

The water balloon contest was a recurring theme, with details on the contestants (Charlie, Dan, Irish Jay, Paul, and Justin) and their results, including Charlie's victory with four pounds of liquid (after also vomiting), and Dan's second-place finish with three pounds.  The size of the balloons were compared to various fruits and a volleyball.  The winning prize was an Xbox.  Earl also made a studio appearance, giving away a six-CD set celebrating black music.  The hosts briefly discussed a future listener event involving beer.  The show concluded with the announcement of the water balloon contest winner, further listener calls, and the hosts' goodbyes and announcements.  Throughout the broadcast, offensive language and sexually suggestive humor were prevalent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Friday! Friday! Friday!  Wow, I need a drink!  Take your ball, but take your own time! 
[00:00:30]  What are you people? On the door?  Cancel your appointment!  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Marijuana is an archaic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm.  Liar!  Marijuana is the bomb.  Liar!  Hey, everybody! We're all gonna get laid! 
[00:01:00]  Yeah. Wait, what?  Nice head, Pete.  Oh, who's all doing?  Well, don't you?  Some Puerto Rican guy.  Time to be sad.  Shut up!  Ask yourself!  Hello, my brother. You've got to buy your own.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  This is going to be a very, very busy day, so we've got to get right into it. 
[00:01:30]  Right, Anthony?  Oh, hell yeah.  We prepared for two shows this week.  A new record for Opie and Anthony.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Washington, D.C.  No.  Including Washington, D.C.  No.  Including Washington, D.C.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  We're acknowledging Washington, D.C. today because... 
[00:02:00]  That disaster.  Well, they're humbling us.  That's the disastrous portion of the Opie and Anthony front lines.  The part that is not holding up, being trampled.  We do radio in Washington, D.C. to stay focused and to be humbled, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just in case our heads are getting a little too big.  Yeah, then we've just got to look at what's going on in Washington with this show. 
[00:02:30]  And that brings us right back down to earth.  Holy S!  Hello?  Hello?  Washington?  If you've been keeping track...  Did we lose you?  We've only been in Washington for, I guess, almost four months, I believe.  Right, Ant?  Yeah.  We inherited Don and Mike's number one afternoon drive show in Washington, D.C.  They were number one since the inception of radio.  First month, we took that down to fifth place.  Second month, we took it down to 11th place. 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  And where do we stand now?  And I am proud to say we are now in 14th place in Washington, D.C.  14th!  14th place!  That is beautiful!  Oh, they are talking in Washington, D.C.  They're betting how much longer we will be on the air in Washington, D.C.  In D.C.  Holy mackerel!  Thank you!  Let me get this straight.  We took a first place show.  We brought it down to fourth.  Then we brought it down to...  11th. 
[00:03:30]  11th.  And that's when we started using the excuse, well, it's not 11th.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, and now it's 14th.  14th place.  We're in 14th place.  All right.  How much lower can we go?  It goes down into, like, the 30s and stuff.  All right.  Well, we're looking forward to being there.  I believe the Greaseman's down in the 30s somewhere.  Waddle Doodle!  On his Vietnamese station.  At least they're ahead of me, the Greaseman.  Waddle Doodle!  So, there you go.  Bone Dry, Snarlins, 14th place. 
[00:04:00]  Why don't you just say, no wonder they dragged them behind trucks.  And then you'll get publicity.  Publicity!  And before you know it, your ratings will be where mine are.  Oh, wait a minute.  They're in the toilet.  We'll be back with more of the Greaseman show.  14th place.  Waddle Doodle.  And on top of that, we were voted worst radio show in Washington, I think.  By who?  The press is actually calling Super GM Ken Stevens.  Who voted us that? 
[00:04:30]  A bunch of dweebs.  All the listeners?  Washington Radio?  No, it wasn't the listeners.  No?  No, just a bunch of dweebs on one of those message boards.  Oh.  Oh, it's an internet vote?  Yeah, you know, the people that don't like when radio changes.  They want the same old thing.  Oh, the population of D.C.  Seems.  Rating.  So, if you're listening in Washington, thank you.  Thank you.  You're alone.  Who knows how much longer this is going to last?  You're alone. 
[00:05:00]  14th place.  Oh, my God.  Someone says, if we get to last place, there's nowhere but up to go.  So, look forward to being in last place.  Well, we feel when we go into a new city, we kind of have to scare away all the old listeners.  We call it the purge.  The purge.  And then we bottom out.  Ask New York about this.  It worked perfectly in New York.  There was a time we were in 22nd place here in New York.  Right.  And then, hopefully, new people come in.  Hopefully.  And then you grow from there.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  But being voted the worst radio show in Washington, come on.  I know.  Come on.  And there you go.  There's a fan from D.C. checking in, Cindy.  And what does Cindy say?  She said she didn't like us at first.  And now she can't turn us off.  I don't know if that means she likes us or something's wrong with her radio and she just can't turn us off.  I think she punched the radio so much that it doesn't change the dial anymore.  And she said, thanks for getting me hooked on Grand Theft Auto 3. 
[00:06:00]  Bought it for my boyfriend.  But I have called in three days this week to stay home and play.  She called in sick.  I was just reading an email from a guy who said that he's heading toward divorce because of half-life.  The addiction?  Half-life?  Yeah.  Someone from Boston.  He said that his brother, last time he visited, gave him a half-life.  He's been married nine years.  He's got, like, a four-year-old.  And he's now skipping work and avoiding sleep.  Dude, the game's like three years old.  Come on.  Get with the times.  There's plenty of other games to be addicted on. 
[00:06:30]  That's like, I don't know, that's like doing coke.  It's old.  It's old hat.  You've got to get on to, like, Vicodin now.  There's newer drugs to get on.  Coke has come back, my friend.  Is it?  I don't know.  Look at me.  Speaking of games, quickly, last night I was on EverQuest, of course.  I'm always playing that God-effing game.  And I just got to say thanks.  Fan of the show is on.  Knows who he is.  Hooked me up with so much great gear for my character there that I'm playing on EverQuest. 
[00:07:00]  Hooked me up.  Hundreds of thousands of pieces of platinum worth of equipment.  Thank you, my friend.  Hey, a lot of people are acknowledging something, so we've got to go with it.  Mark, what do you have for the O.P. and Anthony show?  Mark.  Yeah.  What do you have?  They just killed the F bit.  Yeah, the beeps are really long in the F lesson.  Yeah.  You don't understand if it's a noun or an adjective, an adverb.  It beeped, the beeped, the beeped.  You don't understand the word.  Yeah, what happened to that bit, Rick? 
[00:07:30]  What happened?  What happened, Rick?  The beeps weren't sufficient.  We had to re-beep our F lesson bit.  We had to re-beep it.  If there was a little bit of an F or a K that you could hear, it had to be beeped out.  They're getting carried away with things that will not get us in trouble.  Who said that one?  Came from our dumpster.  Guys, it's beeped, Washington.  No, we're going to talk to the lawyer about that.  If there's a beep and a K sound or a F and a beep sound.  There's not even an ending.  There's no ending sound.  The I-N-G, the K.  I don't know if it's fork.  You can't make sense of it at all. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, fork the forking forker.  Yeah, we'll bring it up with the lawyers.  Thank you.  All right.  Now people are getting a little too insane with cleaning up our show.  All right, Anthony.  So that's the latest news on the syndicated radio front.  We suck at Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  But Cleveland loves us.  Really?  Cleveland, my God.  There's a revolution going on in Cleveland with this program.  They are coming on board, loving it. 
[00:08:30]  Everyone that goes to Cleveland tells us they see the support, the wow stickers, and it shows up in the ratings.  It's amazing.  So Cleveland, you do indeed rock.  Washington, I don't know what to tell you.  I don't know what to tell you.  This is the show.  Like it or not.  It's not going to change.  This is all you're going to get.  It's not going to be some big renaissance going to happen to this program, and all of a sudden, they're going to go, oh, I like it now.  This is all you get.  You think they're sitting there in Washington going, well, maybe they've had the flu for the last one. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, maybe.  They're going to be healthy soon.  Sorry.  It's all you get.  Maybe the real talented guy on that show has been on baby leave or something.  Yeah, maybe he'll come back.  Maybe he'll come back.  This is what you get, man.  This is it.  I think we'll do just fine if they give us enough time.  We will see.  All right, and another thing.  Did the guys start their league contest?  They're still coming in.  Okay.  They're coming in, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  We'll get into that in a second, but really fast.  We've all seen the Osama bin Laden tape.  We're all completely pissed off and frustrated, and we want this guy dead, right?  Just when you need another burst of anger.  You know what I mean?  Like you just start taming down a little.  The clips, the vivid images of the attack sort of getting a little fuzzy around the edges.  Then we got to watch this tape of bin Laden last night and just see him gloating with  all of his towel-headed scumbags that you just want blown up. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, it was nice to see.  Okay.  I have an observation, and I think we were a little bit guilty as far as this goes as  well.  But we will stop, and I'm hoping that TV and other radio shows will stop as well.  Let's stop having these discussions and having people call in and go, so what do you think  we should do to bin Laden?  And then you get some wacky person on the...  I just saw one on Fox.  I think we should bring bin Laden to the United States. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And then what we do is, at halftime of the Super Bowl, shut up!  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Or, I think we should bring him to New York City and drop him off at the nearest firehouse.  Shut up!  That's just so stupid, and then they all come up with forms of torture.  Dude, we get him, right?  We get him.  We get him, right?  And you take the lid from a tuna can, right?  But a real rusty one, right?  And you slowly cut his yam bag off. 
[00:11:00]  All right, sure.  This is what we do.  We take a bunch of rats, we put them on his bare stomach, and then we put a fish tank  over the rats so they have to eat their way out.  Yeah.  I knew some guy that that happened to.  Look, you know, there's a very small percentage of people out there that just don't want him  dead.  Yeah.  The majority wants him dead immediately.  Exactly.  That's all you need to say.  It's watching CNN last night.  I say we put it on pay-per-view, and you see what we do is we torture them live on pay-per-view, 
[00:11:30]  and all the money will go to...  Shut up!  It's not going to happen!  There were a couple of lawyers on CNN last night, and they're discussing if bin Laden  gets captured and brought to the United States.  They asked this one lawyer, they go, would you defend Osama bin Laden?  And I'm like, oh, yeah, I kind of turned around from my computer game for a second.  You know, it's an interesting question. 
[00:12:00]  Would the guy defend bin Laden?  And if he says yes, what's his excuse for it and everything?  So I'm waiting.  He was in a pretty good spot.  And he starts this very eloquent speech about how he would indeed accept bin Laden as a client,  would defend him, because he says it's not so much a defense of bin Laden, it's a defense  of the American way of life, the American system, everybody that's flying the flags and being  proud of this country, it's a defense of that portion of this nation, the right to a trial, 
[00:12:30]  the right to a defense, and I'm thinking, and for a split second, I'm going, you know,  the guy's making a great point.  Well, lawyers spew that stuff all the time.  Right.  He's making a great point.  For a split second, I thought this.  Then I took, I had a big, heavy statuette next to the TV, and I started beating myself  over the head with it when I realized, what am I, an idiot?  This is a lawyer talking. 
[00:13:00]  This is an effing lawyer talking, and he's talking about this like it's a perfect world.  In a perfect world, in a perfect United States, that would be right.  You bring him here, you try him, and I'm not even talking about death penalty or life in  prison or anything like that.  I'm talking about the trial phase, the way of life here in America.  Your right to a trial, even though he's not an American, whole other story.  Then I'm thinking, this son of a bitch, it isn't perfect, and it doesn't work, because  they'll find, they'll throw race into it, they'll twist it around, they'll get evidence 
[00:13:30]  thrown out, they'll get this thrown out, and it turns out, technical loopholes.  Yeah, two words, O and J. Same thing.  There's a guy absolutely guilty, and the lawyers used race and all kinds of other crap to get  that thrown out.  So his speech went right out the window to me.  It seemed nice.  In a perfect world, yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Okay.  No matter how heinous the crime is, you deserve an attorney who's going to defend you and a  trial.  But you know something?  You're missing the obvious, though.  What?  Bin Laden doesn't deserve any of that for the simple fact he's not an American.  Exactly.  Besides the fact that, you know, he's a sadistic...  Right.  Well, I'm just talking about even Americans that do heinous crimes.  Oh, John Walker.  Yeah, there you go, that guy.  He's officially an American citizen still, right?  Yeah.  As far as I know.  Yeah, there'll be lawyers defending him. 
[00:14:30]  You watch.  I just hope that John Walker has one of those accidents over there in Afghanistan before  he comes home.  If it was an actual fair trial without all that lawyer bull crap loophole S, I don't  want to say that S for it so bad, that would be fine.  Yeah, wow.  Our American way of life in action.  There it is.  There's the guilty guy.  We'll give him his trial.  We know he's guilty, but defend him.  Do whatever you need.  And it's all lies and legal bull.  Michael, what's going on? 
[00:15:00]  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Listen, did you see last night how some of the Arabs in the world, I guess Arab Americans  were saying that the tape was fake?  Well, yeah, I have seen that.  Yeah, it's just ridiculous at this point.  You know that the father of, what's his name, Adda?  Oh, yeah, yeah, the head muckety-muck hijacker.  The one face we've seen the most.  Mohammed Adda.  Yeah.  Adda, whatever, his father's swearing that his son wasn't on the plane, that they stole 
[00:15:30]  his passport and his identification.  The Jews did it, he says.  Yeah, well.  And that someone else was on the plane as his son, and that he's actually heard from his  son since September 11th.  Sure he has.  And, you know, I don't know if you know about the NBA, the guy in the NBA who wouldn't stand  up for the Pledge of Allegiance, that show was on a couple of days ago, and he was talking  about how he has proof of Israelis actually taping when the planes flew into the World  Trade Center.  I mean, it's all spin. 
[00:16:00]  Of course it is.  People spin it for their own...  Well, what kills me is they actually have an Arab, right, in, I guess, in Jersey somewhere,  and they approach him, and he's an American, I guess, American Arab, whatever, and he says,  oh, it's all fake, it's all fake.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, it's fake.  Like, oh, they put that tape together.  No.  This guy's a scumbag.  He's responsible for this, and he should just be killed.  Do you think he's still alive?  I don't know.  I know they've been bombing the crap out of those mountains.  I know they've been bombing the crap out of those mountains.  I know they've been saying two words.  One word, Daisy Cutter, I mean. 
[00:16:30]  They've been bombing the crap out of those mountains.  We saw some great stuff.  Ben Lotton's definitely still alive.  You think he is?  Yeah.  But there's some great stuff today.  I really believe they know where he is.  All right, guys.  All right.  All right, have a good weekend.  You too, man.  Bye-bye.  You see what they're doing now?  I love the people that argued when this whole thing started that, hey, the Russians were in there.  The Russians were in there for 10 years, bogged down in their version of the Vietnam War.  Now America's going to get in there.  Oh, my God.  You see the technology we're using for these caves?  The one they were showing just before the show today? 
[00:17:00]  It's classic.  They get a plane, flies over these mountain chains, and throws down a huge beam that reflects back images of inside the mountain.  Is it images, or does it go for heat or movement?  It goes for rock density.  So if there's a big open pocket inside the mountain, it's marked by the plane and shot up to a satellite, which marks the location that the plane just marked.  Now the satellite beams that location to the heavy bombers that then go in and pinpoint drop right where the first plane marked the open part of the cave and just blast it. 
[00:17:30]  This guy, who knows?  Bin Laden could be in, he could be just obliterated already.  I'm hoping, though, they at least go through these caves, and if he is dead, they at least find his head.  Because if there's ever been a guy that needs his head on a stake to tour the country, it's him.  You know how they sometimes do that with art exhibits? 
[00:18:00]  They bring it to the U.S., and you can go to a museum and see it, and then it's off to California.  His head!  And I'm not talking about doing it at the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  This is after he's dead.  Guys, this is what you do.  You take him to ground zero.  Shut up!  Stupid.  All right, Rick, what's going on?  We've got to get the contest going?  Yep, guys are going.  We've got our last Xbox that we're giving away today, Anthony.  Yes.  A lot of people think today's our last day before vacation. 
[00:18:30]  No, we're going to do like three days next week, and I think we're going to do some beers with the listeners before we say sayonara to the year 2001.  So we'll have details on that.  But this is our last Xbox of the season.  We've got how many guys out there?  So far, about ten guys out there.  They're just finishing up their paperwork.  Look at these guys.  They just show up for anything.  We try to get the goddamn you bitches.  We try to get you down here and give you prizes.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  We try to give you prizes for something. 
[00:19:00]  We've got to beg and plead just like we were trying to have sex in junior high.  And we put out a contest for guys, doesn't matter what it is.  Yeah, because we overbooked the guys, and we're stupid because they all showed up.  We overbooked the girls, and only one shows up.  We had a contest where we wanted guys to put their junk in a jar with bees in it.  And the first person that got stung was going to win a prize.  A prize?  A car.  Yeah, a car that we never got.  That's right.  Roger, I got an Aztec. 
[00:19:30]  Douchebag.  We will be doing that promotion.  Yeah.  But the thing is, that's a pretty horrible thing.  Guys clamoring.  We're going to knock on the goddamn door down to get in on that.  No problem.  They're going to put their junk in a jar with one bee in each jar.  First guy to get stung.  Because you've got to try to make the bee sting you.  Yeah.  Who's going to win the Aztec?  Women.  It's like, hey, if we get a girl down here to say hello, we'll give you a great prize.  Hello, please, ladies.  Could you show up and just, like, through the glass, peek and wave, we'll give you a great prize. 
[00:20:00]  All right, we've got no ladies coming.  The bitches.  All right.  You bitches.  So we've got at least ten guys.  The pools are ready.  Pools are ready.  The water's ready.  Are they stretching out their balloons?  They'll be handed the balloons very shortly so they can get those ready.  Yeah, balloons.  All right, that's another name for condo.  What?  Balloons.  Whatever.  And they're supposed to start immediately.  Yeah.  We'll probably be ready to go by the beginning of the next break.  All right, cool. 
[00:20:30]  So we'll, right, the contents will begin after the break.  And the one that fills up their balloon without popping it.  Well, yeah.  The one that ends up with the most at the end.  Yeah, do we have a scale?  We don't have a scale, but we can probably use it in terms of, you know,  pouring the contents back in the thing and measuring how many.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You're going to take the balloons filled with, you know what, and pour them back.  And I get the loire in.  And I get the loire in.  Yeah, licking his fingers.  Mmm. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, that's good.  I'd go to a doctor.  That's a little sweet.  How would you know?  We need a scale.  We need a digital scale.  How would I know?  We need a digital scale.  You want me to put out the word?  We'll get a scale.  We have an education.  We have a postal scale here we can use.  A what?  Postal.  They're not going to let us use the postal scale.  They get pissed off.  What if it's...  Off, whatever.  Let's leave the post office alone.  Yeah, they have their problems with anthrax.  Don't worry about it.  Someone help us out and bring down a digital scale,  and we'll let you hang out for the whole show today.  First person down. 
[00:21:30]  How's that?  With a scale?  Yeah.  That's not exactly a great...  Ooh, get to hang out and watch guys, you know.  Well, no.  Well, you've got the girls from Privileged Gentleman's Club coming down,  and we've got the Regan brothers coming in.  Brian Regan playing Caroline's this weekend.  Oh, no.  All right.  So we'll start the contest next, get into some other things of discussion.  Anthony, we have so many new bits for our radio show,  I don't even know what to play.  Isn't this...  Look at how happy we are.  There's all kinds of new things.  Steve sees working like a maniac. 
[00:22:00]  It's almost finished.  The Talking Jim Nortendahl we're going to be playing today.  Oh, Talking Jim Nortendahl.  I think we should play the one from yesterday, the fake commercial.  I have to say that so the other cities don't start their commercial.  Oh, yeah.  We could do the fake commercial for the Homeless for the Holiday CD.  Uh-huh.  And then a little later we could do Brother Joe's brand new Christmas song, Anthony.  Isn't that something?  That we haven't even played yet.  And then a little later we'll play the Talking Jim Nortendahl.  And then we go home. 
[00:22:30]  This is the type of stuff that's making us the worst radio show in Washington, D.C.  The type of stuff that makes us work less.  You know, that just means we're going to do really well in Washington.  And if the dweebs on a message board like us...  Wake up!  Wake up, Opie!  Wake up!  On the Opie, you would...  I swear to God, you just fell asleep and you were talking in your sleep.  You must have been dreaming that we would do well in Washington someday.  Are you kidding me?  If dweebs that spend their whole time talking about how radio used to be...  Yeah.  ...thinks we stink, then I think we're on the right track. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  That's what I'm trying to say.  I'll go with you there.  All right.  Here's a fake commercial and we'll be back with more show.  You've heard them go shopping on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now hear them sing.  K-Smell Records and the Salvation Army present Homeless for the Holidays.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, what fun it is to ride on a goddamn subway.  Spend Christmas with your favorite homeless lunatics. 
[00:23:30]  You'll hear all the classics.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Had a very shiny nose just like yours.  Deck the Hall.  There is the season to be darling.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  And who could forget Ziggy's haunting rendition of Silent Night?  Silent Night.  Holy night.  And if you call within the next ten seconds, we'll throw in as an added bonus, 
[00:24:00]  the making of Homeless for the Holidays featuring never-before-heard homeless outtakes.  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head and shoot all these motherfuckers.  Let me off.  Let me off.  Let me off.  I'm tired of s***.  I said I'm tired of s***.  Off key, out of time, and smells horrible, it's Homeless for the Holidays.  Get yours today.  Call 1-800-HEP-A-TITUS.  Get your balls out. 
[00:24:30]  Slap your ass up.  Get your feet in.  It's today.  That could be the gayest thing I've ever heard.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're not homosexual, but we are willing to learn.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Disturbed voices. 
[00:25:00]  Brian Regan on his way into the studio in a little while, Anthony.  Playing Carolines this weekend.  Tickets go fast when he comes to New York.  He's going to be in here with his brother this time around.  Should be fun.  Yeah.  So we got that going on.  Also, I guess we could start the Xbox competition.  Yeah, we've been talking about this all week.  I see some of the contestants out there have their balloons in their hands,  stretching them out, getting them all ready to contain a lot of liquid. 
[00:25:30]  The whole object is they're going to be drinking a lot of water, I guess.  And whoever fills up their balloon first or actually gets the most in there during the course of the contest will weigh it and find out will win.  And they've got to hold the whole thing the whole time.  They've got to hold.  There's a lot of strategy here.  It's not just about seeing how much you can fill up your balloon.  What it is is, yeah, one guy might fill it up a little more, but his might break. 
[00:26:00]  Or he might drop it when the weight of all that liquid in his one hand, because the other hand, you've got to use it to hold on.  It could break.  He could drop it.  There's going to be strategies here.  They're standing in kiddie pools, inflatable kiddie pools.  So if they have a little accident and drop it, all that disgusting stuff isn't going to go all over them.  Who's going to be watching these guys to make sure they don't put down the balloon, make sure they don't go to the men's room?  Rick, I'm sure, is going to watch very closely. 
[00:26:30]  Rachel, you want to watch the guys today, make sure they don't cheat and stuff?  Is this the one I'm talking into?  Yeah, that's the one.  The ghetto mic?  I know.  That's interesting.  I think the Hindenburg crash was announced on that one.  I'm actually really interested in seeing their reactions, because they're all going to be pretty much full throttle in front of everybody, in front of all these other guys.  Yeah.  But guys, we don't really care.  Well, I guess.  I mean, I guess because you usually whizzes in front of each other. 
[00:27:00]  Guys will kind of whizz together in the woods and stuff, but we won't look at each other.  No, no, there's no looking.  There's no looking.  Well, at least you don't know who's gay and who's not.  Well, that's when the girls from Privileged Gentleman's Club comes in.  Oh, they are coming in.  That's when we find out who's gay and who's not.  Oh, it's to get the little gayness out.  You know, the strippers always sweep the gayness away from this show.  There was a guy in hold.  He hung up.  And he wanted to say, let the gayness begin. 
[00:27:30]  He was very funny, but he couldn't hold on again.  I don't know where those girls are going to fit, because there are so many people out there.  Yeah, we have about two, four, six, not about.  We have ten guys.  And there's actually more people upstairs, so I've got to go.  Oh, really?  Well, you know what?  The competition has begun, Anthony, officially.  Yep.  Rick, we don't have to wait for the other guys.  No, hell no.  You're late, you're late.  Right.  So we should, what are they doing out there?  They're just starting to drink their water.  Some are still stretching out their balloons. 
[00:28:00]  See, what we're used to, which is awful, is no one's showing up for these,  because it's usually girl things.  Like we said before, the girls don't show up.  It doesn't mean that when we do a contest with guys that we have to have everyone down here.  We're so used to everyone that shows up involved with the contest, because it's, ooh, three people.  This one, it's like we've got ten people out here already.  Start the goddamn contest.  There'll be other people.  They're all in the pool.  Some of them have their shoes and their pants off.  But they're all drinking.  Do they know the rules, Rick?  They cannot put down the balloon.  Right, yeah.  I was explaining that.  They have to hold the thing the whole time. 
[00:28:30]  Anyone show up with waiters?  Like the big rubber boots?  No.  Like if I was doing that, I'm going to stand in a kiddie pool with guys that are doing this,  and I wouldn't want, you know, my feet covered with that.  I should have worn the big rubber waiter boots.  Did you show them how this is going to work, too?  Because remember, yesterday, the first time we tried it, it didn't work right.  Did you show them how they have to kind of stretch it as it goes?  They're blowing up their balloons.  I think it's funny if they don't know, some of them.  Well, do they know they can start the process, the contest, let's say? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  As soon as they have to go, they know they can start it.  This is very important.  Tell all these guys, I think this should be a rule,  that if they step out of that goddamn kiddie pool with that thing on, they are out.  Already told.  What automatically lose?  One guy wanted to get out of the pool and just like, he goes, can I rest like this?  I'm like, no, you have to stand up in the pool.  So they've got to stand up for three straight hours?  Hey, sorry, but you know something?  Do you want them carrying a huge balloon full of that out of that kiddie pool? 
[00:29:30]  Agreed.  Because I'll tell you what, we play foosball out there,  and I don't want to have to smell anything bad for months.  All right.  I wanted to talk to a few of these guys, though.  I've got a mic.  Okay.  You got headphones on so you can hear?  Yep.  All right.  Get Jason from Ireland on the air.  Where's Jason?  Hi, I'm in there.  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on, guys?  What's up, Jason?  Not too much.  Let's go on this guy up here, see what happens.  Are you psyched or what?  I don't know.  You promised me Guinness here yesterday, and no Guinness.  Well, we might have a one or two in the round. 
[00:30:00]  We might have a little something-something.  Not going to waste it on you guys.  That's right.  That's why the water.  It's the good stuff.  Believe me, there's an icy cold Guinness laying around here somewhere.  Hey, Rick, let's talk to a few of the other guys real fast.  All right, introduce yourselves.  Who's this?  Joey from Whitestone.  Hey, Joey, what do you think your chances are?  Looking at these guys, not too good.  No.  It's just what they do.  You know, Anthony, there were a few guys.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  They were stupid enough to hit the men's room as soon as they got here.  Very dumb.  You just...  It's like just throwing money down the toilet.  You're doing that.  Who else we got, Rick?  We got this guy over here.  Since I was 21, man.  Whatever.  What?  Hey!  Hey!  All right, what's going on, Rick?  What the hell is that?  Rick, has someone started?  Uh, what's up? 
[00:31:00]  How's it going?  Oh, wait a minute.  Is it one of our stone friends?  All right, I don't want to stand next to this guy.  Wait, who is that guy with the crazy laugh?  That's Tom.  That's the guy.  Come over here.  You got that right.  How are you guys doing?  Why is he...  All right, take the mic away from him, Rick.  Would you please?  Hey, Rick.  Rick, why don't we tell the guys what they can and can't say?  That'll work. 
[00:31:30]  I just gave them a rundown, and this idiot starts saying the words.  That's exactly what we can't say if we're going to be responsible broadcasters.  Great.  The talking to them portion going so well.  All right.  So why don't they just start the contest for the Xbox, all right?  Has anyone begun, Rick?  Like I said, they're all drinking their water.  That's about it, and they've stretched out their balloons.  Who's going to be the first one?  You can start whenever you want.  Who's going to be the first one to break the seal, Anthony?  I'm sure he'll get... 
[00:32:00]  When we hear the applause, the ovation...  Hey, Rick.  ...coming from out there.  Ask him who's going to be the first one to break the seal.  All right.  Who's...  Which one of you guys is going to go first?  David?  David looks like he's going to go first, so go ahead.  Get things started.  I want to hear the reaction from the other guys.  Game is on.  You can't step out.  Stay in the pool the entire time.  Is he ready, Rick? 
[00:32:30]  He's got his back to me, but, yeah, it looks like he's going to work.  I just want to see if he prepared his balloon.  His balloon.  Because, like, when you make those...  When those people make the balloon animals, they've got to stretch them out so they blow up easier.  Right.  Nothing?  That's the thing you've got to do to prep the balloon, or else it'll just overflow.  Is he a little shy?  He seems a little...  He's got stage fright.  There's something...  Yeah, there's something else going on here.  It's not easy to do that in front of other people, Anthony. 
[00:33:00]  Do we have a smaller prize that we can give to the first person that starts this off?  That's a great incentive.  Is that...  No, no, not that good.  I'm just talking, like, some CDs or something.  Yeah.  All right, Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  Announced that the first person that actually gets anything in their balloon is going to get some CDs.  All right.  All right, guys.  First person who has to start spilling their balloons gets some CDs.  Who? 
[00:33:30]  No, he hasn't...  He's not.  One guy's got a strange strategy.  He's holding...  He's got both...  Well, I want to describe this correctly.  Let's just say he's facing me, but you still can't see anything.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like he's camouflaged?  Like the shorts are on and is...  I got you.  Okay.  Yeah, like everything's inside.  He's doing the Al Bundy with both hands.  So you can't tell if he has a peeler or not, right, Rick? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, exactly.  Oh, we have one guy.  Oh, oh.  Contest is on?  Contest is on.  Contest is on.  All right.  What's your name, dude?  Dan.  Dan is our first guy, and he is...  Was Dan drinking a lot of fluid before the show today?  Hey, Dan, were you drinking a lot before the show?  A lot of water, yeah, man.  Now, Rick, have you noticed, is it stretching out the way that it was during our little test yesterday?  I haven't noticed that yet.  I don't think he's got enough volume yet to start the stretch. 
[00:34:30]  Wow, that's weird.  That's really not much at all.  So, just a little...  How does that happen?  A little drip.  A little...  And, wow, what a surprise.  Brian Regan just walked in.  Hey!  What's this?  Tell Brian we did this for him.  Doug, what's going on?  You know, there's no recovery from this, you know.  What do you mean?  Gay zone forever.  First, it was the peanut put-put-put-put-put tears about it.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  God damn.  Hold on, Doug. 
[00:35:00]  Can I make an announcement to everyone that's going to call this show also, and you, Doug?  What?  Let's...  We all know what's happening here in the studio today.  We don't need to say it.  Yeah.  See, you just...  Have you noticed...  Have you noticed that ONA, your buddy's ONA, haven't even said what's going on in the goddamn studio today?  So we can't have callers calling up and saying what's going on.  All right.  Those hot chicks...  How hot do those chicks look in the studio?  Well, they're not here yet, so you're right about... 
[00:35:30]  But who's in the studio now?  Just Ant and I.  Yeah.  What's going on in the studio, though?  Rick is...  Rick is outside the studio area.  With our contestants.  With the contestants who are in the kiddie pool.  Oh!  What happened, Rick?  Take it easy, guys.  All right, bye.  What happened, Rick?  Rick, what happened?  The guy doing the double Al Bundy?  Yeah.  Wow.  It looks like he's on the road.  Is he in the lead?  He looks like he's in the lead.  And also, Dan, the first guy who won the CDs, has got the stretch going with the volume that he's... 
[00:36:00]  He's...  So how many guys have started the contest?  Officially, two.  Two.  Officially, two.  Oh, come on, brother.  Come on.  And the guy who was going to go first...  Now what are you doing?  Now it's up to three.  I like the competition.  Listen to him.  They're all like, yeah.  Game on.  Well, they brought their friends to root him on, too.  There's got to be like 30 guys out there.  You know what it's like?  It's like when you shoot the water gun into the clown mouth at the carnival.  And all those balloons just start filling up. 
[00:36:30]  All right, so we've got three guys that have started the contest, huh?  Three guys who are officially underway.  They will be standing in this kiddie pool for the next two and a half hours, at least, Anthony.  How am I going to get water?  And they got to hold their balloon the whole time.  Right.  Tell the guys that, you know, Rachel and Mary and everybody will be handing them the water when they need it.  All right?  Yeah.  All right, Anthony, contest is on.  Contest is on.  I believe we should take a break. 
[00:37:00]  We'll bring Brian Regan in.  We'll bring Brian Regan in next.  You want to hear Brother Joe's brand new Christmas song?  Yeah, I didn't even know we did this.  Hey, Rick, where's...  Yeah, here comes Rick to get it.  So, Brian Regan and his brother...  Is his brother here, too?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  So, the Regan brothers will be in the studio next, Anthony.  The first time that we had Brian's brother on the air.  Very funny guy himself.  He's going to be warming up for Brian at Caroline's this weekend.  Does he like the evil Brian?  Does he wear a beret and a goatee?  Oh, game is on.  He's definitely a little more evil than Brian.  A little more evil.  Well, yeah, would it be safe to assume that if you asked Brian's brother a question about 
[00:37:30]  maybe Adolf Hitler or some other horrible man in history, he would actually say that  he's a bad man, unlike Brian who never has a bad thing to say about anyone?  Oh, yeah.  He has a backbone, yes.  All right.  The Irish guy is now firmly entrenched in this competition, guys.  Oh, really?  Is he in the lead?  No, he's not in the lead.  He's definitely in the top two, though.  How many guys have now started the competition?  Four.  We're up to four.  Now, the guy that's in the lead, what does his balloon look like at this point? 
[00:38:00]  It looks like an upside-down light bulb.  Oh, that's it?  Right.  Like light bulb size?  Yeah.  Well, it's bigger than a light bulb, but it's got that shape.  Almost like a tennis ball?  Bigger than a tennis ball.  Well, Rick, the size.  How big?  You know, compare it to a fruit or vegetable.  It's like a very large, it's a large-sized pair.  Large-sized pair.  Okay.  I got it.  I got it.  All right.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  So, that contest is well underway, Anthony.  That's kind of a little side thing we're doing today.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  West Coast Dave says, I think Brian's brother likes to be called Dennis.  Dennis, you're right.  I know West Coast Dave.  I haven't met him yet when I meet him.  You know what?  We will be pals.  West Coast Dave is right, though, because Dennis Regan has been touring the country for  many years as well.  But we just know Brian.  We love Brian.  He's a friend of ours.  We don't really know Dennis yet.  All right.  So, we'll be hearing a song from Anthony's brother. 
[00:39:00]  Brother Joe.  Brother Joe.  That's just Anthony's brother.  Brother Joe's latest creation, a fine, fine Christmas song.  Very good strategy.  Let's check this out.  And we'll be back with Brian Regan and his brother Dennis.  Hey, man, you want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man.  The police, they got my car.  What do you mean the police got your car?  Just what I said.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  You stupid ass.  The police, they got my car.  Dude, I can't believe the police got your car. 
[00:39:30]  Ah, shut up, man.  The police got my car.  The police got my car.  The police got my car.  The police got my car.  The police got my car.  Dude, that really sucks.  The police got my car.  They ain't coming down to date tonight.  I want to wait to be a bit and start. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, I don't think so. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, I don't think so. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, I don't think so. 
[00:41:30]  In the studio, Anthony.  Yes.  The Reagan brothers.  Whoa.  Actually, Dennis Reagan.  Dennis Reagan.  Yeah.  In the studio, and he brought Brock.  He brought his brother.  He brought my little brother.  It's good to be here with Dennis.  Oh, these guys are playing Carolines this weekend, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, people want to know if we're competitive, you know, because we're doing the same thing.  Yeah.  And we've always been competitive about weird things, like one time we were in a swimming pool, a friend's swimming pool. 
[00:42:00]  We had this contest to see which one of us could hold his head underneath the water the longest.  And Brian was able to hold his head underneath the water for a minute and a half, which is a pretty long time.  But I was able to hold his head under water for two full minutes.  The older brother, man.  Which is remarkable, you know, since he really needed oxygen.  And he was kicking and fighting.  Kind of hard, those last few seconds.  Yeah.  Hold him down.  Oh, by the way, before we start with these guys, we've just got to tell people that Brother Joe's song just blew. 
[00:42:30]  The mix was screwed up.  Yeah, something was awry.  And we'll fix it and we'll get the song on.  I guess you only heard one channel or something out there in Radioland.  You guys trying to do it in Quadrophonic?  We're doing it in Quad.  What happened to Quad?  Didn't one group come out with a Quad album or something like that?  It's recorded in Quad.  Yeah, in Quadrophenia.  Quadrophenia for your quad system at home. 
[00:43:00]  I, you know, never mind quad.  I never had real stereo at home.  It was always some speaker that I found where you had to twist the wires and it would crackle  because you wouldn't go as far as to solder the wires onto the speaker.  They just twisted around the contact on the back.  And it was both left and right, splice those together, and then put them on the one speaker.  And I think the people that had a system like that might have had a problem hearing Joe's song.  I think you're right. 
[00:43:30]  We'll fix it, though.  Hey, Anthony, I just found out something.  What?  Dennis Regan will be on Letterman tonight.  Oh.  Then I got to go.  Really?  This is how he finds out?  You're going to be on Letterman tonight, yeah.  That's pretty nice.  With Michelle Pfeiffer.  And I heard you got top billing.  No, I didn't get top billing.  No?  No, but Thursday night, it was kind of funny because at the end of last night's show,  he said, tomorrow night we'll have comedian Dennis Regan and Michelle Pfeiffer. 
[00:44:00]  And I took that as top billing for 30 seconds.  That's top billing?  I think you just, the card was confused.  You never know.  I wouldn't doubt something happens.  And he goes, we apologize to Michelle Pfeiffer.  We ran along with Dennis.  We'll try to get her back real soon.  We're going to reschedule.  No?  And Dennis just did a stupid human trick, too.  You balanced a pencil on your nose or something. 
[00:44:30]  It stood on my head.  Do one of those little things?  Wait, is this guy for real?  Howie, what's up?  Yo, I saw these guys.  You saw the Regan brothers?  Yeah, I saw them in a double-man gum commercial.  That's right.  Yeah.  You guys really did one of those commercials?  That was us.  We did a double-man gum commercial.  I guess this is like improv.  You're never supposed to deny.  You just always go along with it.  Go along with it.  Yeah, that's right.  Let's do it a little bit for him, buddy.  Double your pleasure.  Double your fun.  Double-man, double-man, gum-man, gum!  When the bell rings, you're deli employees. 
[00:45:00]  Go with it.  Wow.  We're getting some good setups from the call-in people.  Pretend like you're double-man twins.  That's what we want to hear as listeners.  All right.  Now, give me a place.  Okay?  Double-man twins on the moon?  Yeah.  All right.  Now, give me a situation.  We're bouncing high as double-man twins on the lunar surface.  Isn't that right, double-man twins?  And freeze.  God, I hate improv. 
[00:45:30]  God, improv songs.  Hey, you know, I watched these guys do improv one time.  I was working with them.  And they wanted the people in the audience to yell out, a fast-food restaurant.  And then they were going to improvise a scene from there.  Oh, stop.  I just laughed at the setup.  What's going on?  Hey, something going on.  That was funny, too.  What are you doing?  They're probably appalled at this fast-food restaurant.  Maybe we need a report.  Maybe we need a report.  Damn it.  Yeah, we just had a slight problem. 
[00:46:00]  The Irish guy.  What the hell is that beeping?  I don't know.  The Irish guy, the top of his balloon, where you would tie the knot, snapped.  Oh.  I hate with that.  And did he lose it?  No, he still has most of it right there.  But this is going to be hard.  Now, did it fall off of where it was supposed to be?  I want to go back to where you're supposed to tie the knot.  Are you supposed to tie these in a knot? 
[00:46:30]  I wasn't familiar with that technique.  Yeah, I think he was freaking balloon.  So, Rick, how is the competition outside the studio?  It's definitely heating up.  Heating up.  We've got just about every guy now has started in the competition.  We have one guy, a new competitor, just walked in, jumped in one of the pools.  All right.  And it's progressing nicely.  And, again, our leader is the guy who started first.  And how big is his balloon now?  His is now starting to encompass more than the size of his hand.  All right.  So, it's going to be a little harder to hold on to. 
[00:47:00]  It's like the Olympics, this whole thing.  You guys, it's at least the size of a large grapefruit.  We're doing this for you guys.  What just happened?  Rick, what just happened?  What happened?  Hold on, hold on.  The Irish guy was switching hands, and some of it squirted out.  Some of the contents were lost.  Right.  And was it lost on anyone?  I think it came dangerously close. 
[00:47:30]  Well, the contents goes quite well outside the studio.  Yes.  Just as we planned.  What is the object?  What is the object?  All right, Rick, we'll check in with you in a little bit.  I'm going to turn down all the mics so we can spend some time with you guys here.  No, no, what are they supposed to do?  Basically, whoever fills up the balloon the most.  The most.  The most.  Without it popping.  I hear all this going, Rick, what happened now?  Rick, what happened?  Rick, what happened?  The Irish guy has now had to restart the contest. 
[00:48:00]  Uh-oh.  Because he was losing control of his balloon, and just when he decided to step out of the  pool to go to the bathroom to get rid of that one and start on a new one, he ran into Steve  C.  Uh-oh.  Which nearly meant an explosion on Steve C.  Whoa, that would have sucked.  Steve would have killed him.  Did you get any on you, Steve?  No.  No, and if I did, the son of a bitch would not be walking around.  Well, we said that no one's allowed to step out of the pool.  A lot of strategy involved in this contest.  Yeah.  You've got to have rules. 
[00:48:30]  There has to be rules or it would be complete an art.  It would be like silly if there weren't rules.  Of course.  They've got to be in the pool while they're...  I'm glad you understand how ridiculous it would be if there wasn't rules.  There's got to be guidelines and...  See, you know what the thing is?  You think it's easy, you've just got to fill it up.  Oh, but...  The most, but there's a holding on to it, making sure it's attached to your person.  So you tried this before?  Never, never, never.  But I know the best way to do it. 
[00:49:00]  So if they drop it, now they've got to start over.  If it pops, they've got to start over.  So there might be...  Someone might have more than you do, but you might look and go,  okay, he might lose it or it might pop,  so I'm just going to stay right where I am here.  Oh, strategy.  Oh, yeah.  And they've got two and a half hours left in the competition.  So are they just like drinking nonstop?  They're just drinking one hand and...  Oh, yeah.  And wait until it makes its way through.  They're all like a three-foot circle, just staring at each other. 
[00:49:30]  Is that lame?  Can they drink anything they want or just...  Yeah.  Well, mostly water, but yeah, there's some beers out there as well.  Is there?  But, Brian, I got a confession.  We're running out of things to do when you're here.  We're like, oh, no, Brian's coming in.  We've got to do something crazy.  No, I was happy.  He's expecting something crazy when he comes on our show.  I was happy to see the kid pools, man.  That's always a good sign.  When you walk in and see kiddie pools, something's happening.  It's not just like...  We've decided some of the kids are coming up,  and they might want to take a little swim. 
[00:50:00]  I'd like to take a little refreshing dip before we leave.  Sure.  You ever tell your brother Dennis about the time he came in and we were cooking rats,  and you had to be the entertainment?  I don't know if I told him that.  Yeah.  You had two chefs in here.  No, we had one chef and one raving lunatic serial killer, we think.  Who pretended to be a chef, I guess.  Just so he could kill small animals.  We cooked rats.  We had live rats that were brought up here, and the chefs.  One was a French chef, a very good chef. 
[00:50:30]  The other one, just some lunatic who, like I said, wanted to kill a small animal.  And they killed the rats, skinned them, cut them up, cooked them, and people ate them.  People, but not people.  Well, I use that term very loosely.  It's much like the people that are out there right now.  They are human-type forms, carbon, humanoid, humanoid-based creatures, these bipeds.  Bipeds.  But the rats are getting killed and cooked, and we're looking at Brian going, 
[00:51:00]  Brian, why don't you tell a few jokes?  Yeah, that might have been my first time on the show going,  how do I fit into this format?  Do the Pop-Tart bit.  Yeah, knock-knock.  And then we were just talking about the time he stayed late,  and Ron and Fez's show was on, and it was the Laugh Contest.  Oh, yeah.  Remember Make Me Laugh?  Yeah.  And it was the guy, he was in a kiddie pool.  The same swimming pool.  That's why when I saw these, I was like, oh, no, something's going to go awry. 
[00:51:30]  He had had an enema.  Yeah.  And the object was to make him laugh, yeah, and lose what that had given him.  And Opie actually, I believe, won that.  Look at me.  That night.  The guy couldn't take it.  And I think that was the same night you made the hooker leave crying.  The same night you looked like Joey Ramone.  Not just the hooker, the dominatrix.  The dominatrix.  The dominatrix cried.  The big-time dominatrix cried because Opie called her, hey, Joey Ramone.  And all hell broke loose.  Yeah.  Yeah, the dominatrix, very sensitive girl.  Yes. 
[00:52:00]  When they're not putting testicle clamps on you.  Whipping you and what not.  So how have you been, Brian?  Doing good.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys are all over the place now, man.  You're in a...  All like cockroaches.  Once you let them get out a little bit.  You're in Columbus, Ohio.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  I played in Columbus.  And you know the wow thing you guys do?  Yeah.  Well, I guess the actual bumper stickers hadn't even gotten there yet.  And I saw a truck with a guy with electrical tape wrote wow on the back of his truck. 
[00:52:30]  He wasn't going to wait, you know?  I got to see my boobs.  That's cool.  We like that.  Yeah.  Well, that's the one city that's been very, very receptive to this program.  That's good, man.  Unlike Washington, D.C.  No, they're not liking it there.  I don't know what it is with D.C.  Well, we inherited the number one spot in Afternoon Drive in Washington.  And it's now in 14th place.  We went from first to 14th.  I don't think that's what we're supposed to do.  In a matter of months.  Well, it was like when you guys started here.  You're different. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  You're not what we're used to hearing.  We're used to one thing, and this is not that thing.  And it's hard to handle.  We want everything the same as it was.  Stop changing.  That's the way people are, man.  People, if it's new, they ain't interested.  I forgot you were around for those days.  All the phone calls that first time I was on with you guys.  You suck. 
[00:53:30]  Where are the other guys?  But the other guys are the ones that I remember.  I don't know you.  You're different from them.  I don't want nothing different.  I want it the same.  And then they were to ask for their classic rock song.  Remember?  Dude, it's easy, dude.  Just shut up and play the music.  I want to hear CCR.  I want to hear Zeppelin. 
[00:54:00]  We were busting our asses.  Brian's giving them great comedy, and all they wanted was their Jethro Tuller record.  And another song.  Bastards.  Rick, everything's fine out there?  We're not having any problems with slippage?  It's not making a mess?  No problems yet.  Now, how's the competition?  Are there a couple guys close, or one guy running away with it?  They're all pretty close, except for the guy who first started.  I forget his name, but he's really got a lot in there right now. 
[00:54:30]  He's pulling away.  Yeah.  But, you know, he's got two hours to hold on to it.  Is this like when you go to the carnival, and they've got the clown thing with a balloon in the head?  Yeah.  You shoot it in.  That's how we've been describing it.  The bell goes off.  They come over and give you three tickets that you can, you know, save up $50,000 and get yourself a comb.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  I hated that game.  Because no matter how good my aim was, I'd be going, and I'm going, oh, it's getting big. 
[00:55:00]  I know it's getting big.  And then you'd hear that, and the bell go off.  And you're like, son of a bitch.  Who beat me?  You didn't dare look away while you were aiming, right?  And then it doesn't even give you the satisfaction of popping your balloon, even though you were so close.  It goes, and just like your water stops.  The balloon goes limp.  And it's like, great, great.  They might as well play it.  You lose.  Hey, what about skee-ball?  And, skee-ball, did you go off the ramp or did you try to go straight in?  The first few I'd try, and then once I realized I sucked, I would just wing it, like overhand, throw, get yelled at. 
[00:55:30]  Because, again, you're going to get eight billion tickets, and you get yourself like a pinwheel.  Right, I got a pinwheel.  It's spinning.  Where's the trash can?  Wait a second, now I've got to carry this.  You're a jackass.  Those people at the carnival, they go to those arcade games first, and they win like a six-foot polar bear, and they've got to lug it around on their neck for five hours. 
[00:56:00]  You weren't thinking, man.  Arcade games come last.  It's so cheap, too, those things.  You ever get that, especially the little one, you get it, yeah, it looks just like a bunny with a seam up his face.  Like, they didn't even sew him.  Some poor, like, Asian kid getting kicked and stomped on for 20 hours a day, sewing this thing together.  He doesn't know how to hem the seam in to make it look authentic.  Yeah, there's staples in its snout.  A little note in Chinese, help me. 
[00:56:30]  They are trying to win it.  Haphazardly made in China.  I never liked the carnival games, though.  They never seemed worth it.  I swear, I went to one, and they had, like, a, you know, you throw three balls in a basket kind of thing.  Yeah.  You know, and if you've got two out of three or something, they had a sign up that says, put two out of three in, and you win a big stuffed animal.  So they had these big stuffed animals there.  So I put two out of three. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  The guy reaches underneath, and he hands me, like, this three-inch stuffed animal.  That's big.  Exactly.  I said, it says big.  He goes, that's big.  Those are huge.  These funds are big.  How blatantly can you lie?  You came here to get ripped off, didn't you?  Yeah.  What do you think?  That's huge.  No, these are gigantic.  These are gigantic.  Huge ones are here in my pocket.  Enjoy your big one.  Enjoy your three-inch big stuffed animal.  And then the people at the carnival are like that. 
[00:57:30]  Was it a basketball one?  The basketball hoop?  This was like a...  That's triangle-shaped.  The hoop is triangle-shaped.  The hoop is like a wrap-up long.  It's an ellipse.  It's an ellipse.  And you get the people there.  Now, the people that win are always just some jack tool who threw it in right, and a one-in-a-billion shot it went in.  But I like the guys who think they're like Kareem.  Yeah.  They stand there.  They do all the things you're supposed to do to shoot a basket.  And it's not going to work because it's in the ellipse.  It hits the backboard. 
[00:58:00]  It's got to drop in.  Like, you've got to climb up a ladder, put it in, and punch it through because the friction...  No one understands it.  You've got to hit it with a mallet.  You miss two out of three, you'll get a huge idea.  A huge animal.  You've got to throw the dime on the plates.  That's another great one.  It looks easy.  The convex plate.  Plate shouldn't come to a point.  They look like Vietnamese women hats. 
[00:58:30]  Chinese railroad worker.  Can I reach over?  Yeah, you can reach over as far as you want.  Reach over.  Go ahead.  You can set it on here.  They're going to stay.  He just did a racial joke, Anthony.  Brian Riggins.  No.  Chinese hat.  Is that the kind of hat?  Ryan, I always knew you were a racist.  That humor of yours.  The phones are going to light up now.  More Asian woman's hat.  Hey, Paul wants to say hi to the gang.  Paul, what's up?  How are you doing, guys? 
[00:59:00]  All right.  I was going to call in yesterday, but I thought today was more appropriate.  I just wanted to say hey to Brian.  Hey, man.  I've been on every show since you've been on ONA that you've done in New York.  Thank you.  And I look forward to when you walk out, and I'm always yelling,  Big Yellow One is the Sun!  Big Yellow One!  All right, listen.  We're going to try to help out Brian and Anthony Dennis.  Seriously, please do not yell out the punchlines, because everyone gets really scared.  I'm the guy who yells out Big Yellow One is the Sun.  That's great.  That's great.  Yell out the punchline, you dick. 
[00:59:30]  Guys, you've got a hell of a show.  Thanks.  And by the way, Dece, later, guys.  Thank you.  Isn't that great?  You go to Regan's show there, and you're listening, and he's setting up the joke,  and some tool just, the Big Yellow One is the Sun.  Say it.  Do it.  I'm honored that they like it.  Yes, they like it all night.  There's Einstein at some big meeting of scientists giving his theory of relativity,  and there's a guy in the audience.  E equals N, C, square.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Do it.  Do that thing with the relativity.  I was getting to that part.  Brian's a bastard.  Brian's so polite on the show, but you should see him in between shows at the comedy club  doing shots, and the guy barely drinks.  I can't handle it.  Chill these sons of bitches.  I can't handle it.  It's a double-edged sword.  They get the asses in the seats, but they yell crap out.  Boston.  No code.  Now, you know, I have not seen Dennis. 
[01:00:30]  You've seen Brian.  I saw Dennis in Boston.  Hilarious.  I'm going this weekend.  Oh, great.  So I will definitely check it out.  But I'll speak for my brother.  Dennis is fantastic.  He taped Letterman last night.  He's on tonight on Letterman.  He's got, what do you got, about 15 minutes of stuff, Dennis?  I got like eight minutes of A material.  And I have about five minutes of D material.  Now, it's different than we're used to seeing.  No, it's the same thing, just different taglines. 
[01:01:00]  I say the big red one is the sun in demise.  I kind of make it my own.  I take it, I make it my own.  The one you can't see is the black hole.  We were discussing you guys yesterday, and I want to know if you did the Gallagher thing.  Like, you're Gallagher, too.  Gallagher, and Gallagher?  And I said, no, they're very different.  The only time I, oh.  No, not at all.  What I'm going to say is because I remember when I worked up in Boston, I came out and I  said something like, you guys are looking at me like I'm Gallagher, too. 
[01:01:30]  And that's the only time I ever said it.  And somebody came up to me and said, yeah, you say you're not Gallagher.  I go, where do you hear that?  I go, I heard it on the opening.  I go, oh, I only said it once on a whim.  When I was hitting the stage, I said, I thought you were doing Brian's act as Brian in other  parts of the country while Brian's act.  Brian, wait, wait, what?  Brian Regan is going to be in New York and Columbus on the same night.  Well, you know, when I started, I wasn't sure if I wanted to be Dennis Regan, Brian Regan  two, or Gallagher three.  You're three, I don't know.  All you need is that big mallet and the watermelon and some raincoats. 
[01:02:00]  Get your tarps out.  Get the tricycle with the car door on it.  I love that bit.  Yeah, you see those things, they rerun the Gallaghers from, like, HBO.  I don't know why this comedian, he's the only one that they will run HBO specials of from,  I don't even know what the date is, but I see the big 70s gay porno mustache and lapels  that if you run into the wind, you'll take off.  Yeah, it's like from the late 70s, early 80s.  I think there's someone at HBO just going, this guy's the funniest son of a bitch I've ever 
[01:02:30]  seen.  Put him on again.  I think there's this genius guy at HBO.  Put him on again.  I think everyone that likes Gallagher talks like that.  But what do you think of Gallagher, Brian?  I think he does all right.  I actually do, too.  I think he's pretty clever.  With Gallagher, too, I have a problem with.  Is that the guy I'm wrong with?  Yeah, he's got a Gallagher, too.  I was saying that the evil Gallagher with the beret and goatee. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  What's happening?  We need another update.  He's getting nuts out there.  What's your name, dude?  Rick, our correspondent on the scene.  All right.  We had one guy, Alex, whose balloon broke.  Uh-oh.  How did it break?  Is that good or bad?  That's not bad.  I think because he still has his jeans on and it must have rubbed up against the zipper.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't he know anything about technique?  You can't do that.  Well, the bad part is we just found out also that's the only pair of pants he has with him.  Oh, I thought you were going to say, you know, HIV positive or something. 
[01:03:30]  That's not bad for us.  We don't care if he's wet.  Did everyone else bring a backup pair of pants?  Most guys did, yeah.  A backup pair?  The guy doesn't even have another pair of pants?  I was thinking.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  How much was in there when it blew up?  I couldn't tell because he had himself pretty well covered up with his sweatshirt and his pants.  All right.  So where are we at in the competition?  Let's see.  We have Dave, who is leading the pack.  Okay.  He's got what amounts to be a very large-sized grapefruit size of his balloon going on. 
[01:04:00]  Then we've got Justin.  No, Charlie.  It looks like Dave and Charlie are now about tied.  Okay.  We've got one guy, Justin, who hasn't even started yet.  It looks like his strategy is just going to hold it in as long as he can.  And then one big finale.  Right.  And then we just had Joe, who was blowing up into his.  Now, get this, guys.  Uh-oh.  He was blowing air into it while it was already full.  Oh! 
[01:04:30]  And the moans of disgust from the crowd.  But meanwhile, he's trying to say that, you know, it's not gay or anything.  All right.  Well, this is all about Xbox.  If he was blowing up the guys next to him, maybe.  There's nothing really gay about blowing.  It's disgusting.  It's putrid.  It's vile.  But it's you.  It doesn't fall into the gay category.  I don't know.  I mean...  If he was giving the guy next to him a handy as he's blowing into his own, again, could  be interpreted as gay.  You could.  Somebody else bad. 
[01:05:00]  But, Brian, there's nothing wrong with that, right?  There's nothing wrong with that at all.  It's a contest.  Yeah.  If he can, to get ahead.  So then Joe had to evacuate his balloon and restart.  So he's another guy who had to restart as well.  Going to be some restarting.  Yep.  Okay.  Well, we've got two hours left in the competition.  So there's a grapefruit-sized...  Yeah.  Two grapefruits.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Well, we're looking forward to seeing who's going to emerge victorious.  This is for an Xbox.  You know what the...  That's all about gaming console there, Brian? 
[01:05:30]  Yes, don't touch you.  High-powered Microsoft gaming system.  Is that like Pong 2?  It's so much like Pong 2.  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  Pong just kind of stressed me out, so I never...  You know when you'd be at total peace with Pong?  Not during that phase where it would hit the corner and the panel and go...  Like that would just freak out.  When you'd set it up and all of a sudden it's just going...  Back and forth. 
[01:06:00]  Back and forth.  It does it five times and burns a permanent image in your TV screen.  But it would just be like hypnotizing.  No, this is a game system that is like white years.  Oh, my God.  We're talking the original Star Trek Enterprise and Next Generation Enterprise difference.  Huge, huge difference.  You don't play the game?  But don't they say that every couple of years?  I mean, is this the end of it?  Yeah, but you know, there's no end.  There's no end to this?  I hear people with that argument go, I'm not going to buy it now because in like two years or a year it's going to be obsolete. 
[01:06:30]  I'll have to buy a new one.  But, you know, you just got to accept it and keep buying the new units.  I'm not going to buy any of them.  You're not going to buy you guys' computers?  Well, that's why I haven't bought a microwave yet because you know they're going to improve on these things.  I'm going to waste my time buying one of these things I've been on the last 15 years.  They're going to get those TV dinners down to a minute.  I don't like, you know, what was Pac-Man?  Pac-Man, the one that was around for about 50 years and all it did was give me like tension in the bars. 
[01:07:00]  It was just like stressful as hell.  That was the, they figured it out that they could put Pac-Man in a bar table, in a bar,  so you'll sit there and drink and put your change for the drinks in all night and just play Pac-Man.  And it was huge.  Pac-Man and Asteroid's huge if you want to kick it old school with me, with those games.  There you go.  But you guys not into technology at all?  Technology?  Yeah.  Yes, I like phones. 
[01:07:30]  Phones are good.  Fire wheel good.  Do you remember when the first, those ear pieces came out and the first time you saw somebody walking on the street,  you just thought they were talking to themselves?  Yeah, right.  You know what I do sometimes now?  I'm just sitting like at the gate.  I don't even have the earphone in.  I just like burst into conversation.  Yeah, hey, Bob, I'm at the airport.  Yeah, no, I got a flight to Chicago.  Yeah.  Let me talk to Angela.  I got to talk to you about the Henderson file.  Not that Henderson file.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the best thing I can think of. 
[01:08:00]  That's the best thing I can think of.  Oh, is that Ben Henderson file?  What's going on with the Henderson file?  I remember Larry Tate always getting on the...  He always got to have some vague things.  I'm Darren's ass about Ben Henderson file.  You know what?  People would look at you and think, what the hell's he got?  Like, I went balls out, I bought thousands of dollars of equipment,  but this guy's not able to talk without anything on his head.  I remember the first time I saw a guy, you know, when the cell phones first came out,  but they were like these big, huge... 
[01:08:30]  Like a cinder block with a...  Yeah, it was like a foot long with a big antenna on the back.  A case on the side.  Yeah, you needed a trailer to pull it with your car.  Yeah, you had like a hip belt thing with a big box on the side.  It was like ludicrous.  And I remember just sitting in the airport watching this guy walking down the concourse,  and he wanted everyone to know that he had it,  which, of course, you did because it was so huge anyway.  He was talking like way too long.  Honey, yes, I'm talking to you right now.  Yes, on the new phone.  It's like, okay, we get it, buddy.  We see people driving around in the cars with a headset 
[01:09:00]  because it's illegal now in New York to have a phone up to your ear as you're driving.  Well, when I'm driving and I see somebody talking on their cell phone driving,  I get really mad even when I'm talking on my cell phone.  Because you know you can do it.  He's the jackasses weaving all over the place.  I don't care.  I can make collect calls sitting there dialing zero first.  I'm doing all kinds of things that are way off the wall.  You're calling people collect?  Done again. 
[01:09:30]  I guess Carrot Top's getting through to you, huh?  I think we pale again.  Hey, we've got to take a break, man.  Damn it.  We'll check in with the contest next.  The retarded Laverne Shirley are outside.  Oh, great.  We've got Brian Regan and his brother Dennis Regan in the studio playing Caroline's this weekend.  Some tickets still available.  They go fast, though.  You guys should call Caroline's, okay?  As we go to break, Anthony, a new product.  Yeah.  It's the Jim Norton doll.  Ah, I haven't heard this yet.  We have to tell people it's a fake commercial so they don't start their commercials in their city. 
[01:10:00]  Great.  This is a commercial for the Jim Norton doll.  Hey, kids.  Just in time for Christmas, it's the Jim Norton talking doll.  Guy.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show,  and you've probably seen him receiving yellow discipline in cheap motels.  Shut up, stupid.  Now you can bring him home.  Just squeeze his mule and let the sparks fly.  Don't try to make a poignant statement, you ass.  Made entirely of recycled rubbers and stuffed with nails and broken glass,  the talking Jim Norton doll is fun for everyone in the family, even Mom. 
[01:10:30]  Just keep belating your husband until he pays the bills.  Oh, that Jim.  What will he say next?  You talk like a foghorn leghorn.  Shut up.  It's an educational toy, too.  Who better to learn about the birds and the bees than from Uncle Jim?  It's not rape if they blink twice for yes.  Comes complete with martini glass, shaker, and vial of urine.  Some assembly required.  Shut your yaps.  New from Stinko.  It's the Jim Norton talking doll.  You stink. 
[01:11:00]  Available where Megan's Law doesn't apply.  Something crazy is happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guess that's in team's pants.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A lot going on, Anthony.  We've got the Regan brothers in studio.  Brian and his brother Dennis.  Dennis is going to be on Letterman tonight, 
[01:11:30]  and they're both playing Carolines this weekend in New York City.  And outside the studio, we're doing a little something  that we can't really even describe at this point.  Well, I think everybody knows.  It's sort of like a balloon game at the carnival.  We've got to blow the balloon up with water,  and whoever gets the most in there is going to win.  I thought it was a debate about the Mideast.  Yeah, that's also going on at the same time.  Okay, it's like a simultaneous thing.  How about that Bin Laden guy there, Brian? 
[01:12:00]  Osama?  Yeah.  He's hateful.  He's hateful.  Dennis, back up.  Back up.  Dennis, back off.  Choose your words carefully.  He's hateful.  That's all we got.  How do you guys hateful?  All right, well, I disagree with him.  He's mean.  Yeah.  You know how they've offered a $25 million reward  in information leading to his capture?  I took a shot at it the other day. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, I called the CIA.  I got a little map out of Afghanistan,  and I said, he's in a cave north of Tora Bar,  a little cave.  And I just crossed my fingers,  and I'm waiting for them to catch them,  and then I'll expect to check.  That's pretty smart.  You can say A-Cave?  Just A-Cave?  Well, there's not like an address.  You know, it's not like 2562 North Cave Boulevard. 
[01:13:00]  You know?  Right.  Yeah.  What else do you want from me?  He's in a cave.  How much, what, you want me to get him?  Sure.  There's a little, there's like, there's a subway there,  and a blimpies.  You'll see him.  He's mean looking.  Well, good luck with that.  Yeah.  You think they're using walkie-talkies over there, Brian?  Hey!  Oh, damn.  You know, if they are, it reminds me of something. 
[01:13:30]  Really?  They probably are using walkie-talkies.  Yeah, of course.  Walkie-talkies, they were a military invention to begin with,  which is weird, you know,  because usually military stuff has the strong names, you know?  Apache helicopter, Tomahawk missile.  How did walkie-talkie-talkies?  Now, you walkie-talkie, general.  I'm walkie-talkie.  Are you walkie-talkie?  I like it, soldier.  What's this explosive device? 
[01:14:00]  The whammy-kablammy.  And this is the rooty-tooty aim and shooty.  I read one of the news blurbs.  One of the news blurbs said that Sama bin Laden says he has a nuclear bomb, you know?  I picture him dragging it behind a mule, you know, along a bumpy path.  Just bouncing around.  Yeah, just bouncing around.  I wonder what his launching system would be like.  Three, two, one, giddy up!  No, not that way, that way! 
[01:14:30]  Where are you going?  Oh, boy.  Very good.  You know what I was wondering?  This Sama bin Laden, I wonder if he has a chance to eat Pop-Tarts.  Pop-Tarts?  Well, you know, because where he is, he probably doesn't get a chance to eat Pop-Tarts.  I like Pop-Tarts myself.  They've been dropping Pop-Tarts to feed them in a few minutes.  Have they really been?  I swear.  Oh, man, that would have been a better way to get a chance. 
[01:15:00]  Man, that would have been smoother.  Hey, what have they been dropping on them people?  Pop-Tarts?  Pop-Tarts.  Oh, that reminds me.  Well, I wonder if they're dropping a whole box.  They have directions on a Pop-Tarts box.  Like if the directions weren't in Arabic?  I don't know, man.  I don't know why you need them anyway.  English, Arabic?  Like if the directions weren't on there, would somebody, like, put the box down?  Oh, man, how do I get that goodness in me? 
[01:15:30]  They have toaster directions.  You guys do sound alike a little bit.  A little bit.  We've got, you know, the same gene pool.  Right.  Hey, you guys are obviously flying a lot.  Do you have a fear of flying?  Is anything different at the airports?  Well, I still haven't flown.  Man hasn't flown.  I fly all the time.  You're flying Christmas Day.  Really?  You know, I'd rather fly and crash than drive, though, you know.  It's better to fly and crash than drive for any length of time. 
[01:16:00]  Well, I took the Amtrak up to Boston.  Yeah.  Because I had a cold and I didn't want to drive.  I swear to you.  Three hours it usually takes to drive from New York to Boston.  Seven and a half hours by train.  The train, as I, it's not stopping for lights.  It doesn't have to turn much, does it?  At any time.  It's like, right now.  Did you pack your bag yourself? 
[01:16:30]  Uh, yeah.  Uh, well, no, when I got to the airport, these gentlemen asked me, they said, hey, would  you mind if we repack those for you?  So I'm like, sure, why not?  I must have not packed correctly.  Go ahead, gentlemen.  Have your bags been in your sights since you packed them?  Yeah, why?  Is this the last time I'm ever going to see them?  Let me get one last gander.  I think one last look at them. 
[01:17:00]  We should check out on the contest, Anthony.  Let's see how it's going outside.  Hey, Rick, a muck out there?  Without supervision?  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  How's it going out there?  It's, uh, it's actually kind of quiet, actually.  Nobody's, uh, broken anything, uh, with the exception of Joe, who's just a pain in the  ass, right?  Uh, just complaining about the entire, the entire contest.  But other than that, everybody else is, uh, doing well.  All right.  And who's in the lead?  Uh, still, I think it's Dave and Charlie, who are tied for the lead right now. 
[01:17:30]  And how big?  Um, an oversized grapefruit, still.  Have they, uh, relieved?  Yeah, it doesn't sound like, it sounds like they're holding back.  It sounds like they're, it looks like they're holding back, too.  They haven't really done much.  I mean, the one, one guy who broke is already, you know, filling up fairly quickly his second  balloon.  Um, one guy who was trying to hold out as long as he could finally had to go and, uh, had 
[01:18:00]  a little accident with himself.  What do you mean?  He forgot the laws of physics and, uh, he didn't have any air in his, uh, in his balloon and  it shot right back up on him.  Ah!  Ah!  That's why we study physics.  Right.  For just such an occasion.  That's why you learn it.  It sounds like the, you know, when you watch the, the mile and there's always the one guy  who's like laying back and they say, well, he's got a kick.  It sounds like some of these guys are going to have a kick.  They're, they're holding back.  Hey! 
[01:18:30]  One of them's kicking.  Uh-oh.  That didn't sound good.  That's never good when you're in a pool with a bunch of guys.  What's your name, dude?  What's your name?  What's up, Brian?  Brian, uh, the guy that had the physics problem, just had a, uh, gravity problem.  What happened?  It just dropped.  And?  Jump in O&A.  He, he, he's out.  He can start over, but his...  Smells like a homeless guy.  Smells like a homeless guy. 
[01:19:00]  But, uh, yeah, there's a puddle in one pool.  Ah.  Oh, now all these guys got to stand in that.  You know, part of the rules.  Are they barefoot?  And, uh, one side of his shorts is, uh, drenched.  Maybe he should be out of the competition if he can't, uh, control himself.  Um, Brian, what are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  Are you going to continue on or are you going to be out?  Throw another one on.  Well, I guess he's...  He's going to throw another balloon on the, on the fire.  He's in.  All right, he's going to have a...  Think about it.  Comeback. 
[01:19:30]  That's going to be a...  Yeah, yeah.  That's going to start empty now?  That's going to be a hell of a comeback.  They're...  You've got to catch up to a grapefruit.  What's the problem, Ray?  It's his shorts.  They are drenched on one side.  And he's got to stand in there with them.  God, this...  All right, well, we'll check in with you guys a little bit.  This is a great idea.  Yeah.  This is not a great idea.  Are they going to have this in Salt Lake City?  Part of the Olympic competition?  All right.  Awful.  What an awful contest. 
[01:20:00]  You know, usually there's something hot going on.  Where are the girls?  We were supposed to have girls part of this.  They're on their way.  Yes, sure they are.  We didn't want it to be too much of just a whole day with just guys and their junk.  Who are you kidding, dude?  As soon as the girls get here, they're going to look at these guys, go,  Ew, that's disgusting, and come to the studio and get naked.  Well, that's all they've got to do is just kind of be around.  Kind of dust off the creepiness of this whole contest. 
[01:20:30]  Hey, Hal, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I just wanted to tell that hack Regan to take it easy with those new jokes  because I'm forking out $26.50 apiece tomorrow night to see him at Caroline.  Oh, boy.  I don't want to repeat it tonight.  You got it, boy?  Hey, I will back off.  He's got plenty of material.  Nothing but good stuff.  Serious talk here.  $26.50 at that place.  What's going on?  I can go to Governor's for $12.40.  Well, Dennis is with me, so I've got to kick him some money, you know?  I buy him a bologna sandwich.  I get a $1.50 out of it. 
[01:21:00]  $1.50?  That ain't so bad considering your talent.  Oh, God.  Hey, Hal.  Look at Hal.  That is a funny guy.  Mr. Complainer.  Hey, things are too expensive.  You're not funny enough.  That's right.  Be more funny.  Be funnier.  Be more funny.  I hope you have a good time, man.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thanks.  Hey, Brian, will you be doing the names bit at Caroline's?  The names thing?  Yeah.  Well, I was going to do it here, but since Hal is forking out so much money tomorrow, I don't  want to...  Don't anger him. 
[01:21:30]  You don't want to anger him?  So you'll save the names bit for Caroline's?  No.  I don't know if any of your listeners have any babies on the way.  You know, it's like if you're naming a kid, you have to avoid rhymes because other kids  find rhymes.  I'm sure you guys had kids in your neighborhood with rhymes.  You find the rhymes.  You torment the hell out of whoever has a rhyme involved.  There was a kid in my neighborhood growing up. 
[01:22:00]  I couldn't believe it.  His name was Bidiot.  What were his parents thinking?  And his brother Jimbusel.  But we were so stupid, we couldn't find the rhymes.  Bidiot, Bidiot, he is a stupid face.  Jimbusel's a moron.  Jimbusel's dumb.  My parents were embarrassed.  They were like, sound it out.  Sound it out. 
[01:22:30]  Bidiot, what does that sound like?  Cheese.  Cheese.  I didn't get hooked on phonics, man.  I used to love that commercial with that girl.  With the braces.  Hooked on phonics.  Worked for me.  And she would smile and her braces were shining proud.  And I just wondered, what if she was applying what she learned and she couldn't get the commercial  right, you know?  Hooked on phonics. 
[01:23:00]  Working for me.  Hooked on phonics.  Working for me.  Me.  Me.  Okay, cut.  It's not you, Susie.  We're having a lighting problem.  You're good.  You're good, Susie.  Goddamn.  Very good.  You can see that all weekend, right? 
[01:23:30]  Those two jokes, I got them on a loop.  You can see that both of those will not be done at Caroline's?  Oh, I'm not going to get it.  No, actually, I don't do those that often.  It's just, but who knows?  This show's different every time I see it, Brian.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you, man.  And we appreciate that.  I appreciate you guys coming out, man.  Somebody's got to come to town and it's the same 20 minutes, same 40 minutes every time  they come to town.  I try to switch it up, man.  I take some pride in it.  There you go.  All right.  Brian and Dennis Regan in the studio. 
[01:24:00]  Playing Caroline's this weekend.  We'll be back.  We're going to go to the FU line.  We'll check in with the contestants.  Lots going on on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the O.P. and Anthony FU line.  I want to say FU to all those closet nose pickers out there that are sitting in traffic  right now, picking their nose while everybody else is watching them.  I'm sick of it.  Every single day I see them in traffic, and they're picking their nose.  Well, FU.  Next message.  This is my FU.  My FU goes out to Ratna and his friends just to get out of trouble with his own girlfriend 
[01:24:30]  and getting his buddy in trouble for cheating on his girlfriend.  Not cool.  FU, you freaking tool.  Next message.  This is Julie from Philadelphia.  I'd like to send a big FU outside of Blankers.  You drive down 10th Street every night at 11 o'clock and make all the car alarms go off.  FU, dicks.  Next message.  I want to give a big FU to all those Red Sox fans who thought it was nice when the Yankees  lost the World Series. 
[01:25:00]  How'd the zombie look yesterday, girls?  End of message.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know, I just like want to throw one up.  Feel the love.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on in, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Got the Regan brothers in studio.  Brian and his brother Dennis both playing Caroline tonight.  Dennis is going to be on Letterman tonight.  Nice. 
[01:25:30]  We have the contest going on outside the studio for the Xbox.  Guys filling up their balloons, let's just say, okay?  Wonderful.  They're drinking lots and lots of fluids, and the person that fills up their balloon the  most will win the Xbox.  Want to get a quick update?  Yeah, let's see what's going on.  Last we heard, somebody had dropped their balloon.  A lot of the guys are dropping their balloons.  In the pool, and now the guys, the contestants that are in there with him have to stand in 
[01:26:00]  that fluid.  Right.  Hey, Rick, what's going on?  We're just staring at this one guy.  I forgot his name, but it's Tom, and he's got his balloon resting in the pocket of his shorts.  What?  How is he going to, unless he has really big pockets.  He's got really, he's got like NBA pants or something, but he's got a resting in there  to kind of help out his stamina.  I think it goes against the spirit of the game.  It goes against the spirit of the game, but it is part of the rules that we can't find 
[01:26:30]  anything against it.  It's technically okay, I guess.  It's not against any bylaws.  Yeah, next year we might have to state that.  We'll have some rule changes in the offseason.  Yeah, and Dan is no longer in first place.  Oh, really?  He's been passed by Charlie, who's doing the Ted Bundy style.  That was the kick I was talking about.  The kick.  Can I ask what the Ted Bundy style is, and am I missing something?  Let me just show you.  That's what he said.  It's one hand in, but he put two hands in. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  And he's holding it that way, so he doesn't have to have anything sticking out.  Oh, I got you.  Why is that the Ted Bundy style?  Well, no, the Al Bundy style.  Al Bundy.  Ted Bundy style is a lot different.  You kill two girls first.  Yeah.  You've got to kill a college...  Hey.  I hate when they start yelling.  Tom, the guy with the balloon in his pocket, almost had an accident.  See?  What happened?  He was trying to take it out of his pocket and nearly dropped it. 
[01:27:30]  Now, Rick, there's an hour and 20 minutes left in the competition.  How many guys are still in it?  They're all in it.  But, I mean, how many guys have...  It's really between, I think, right now, four or five guys, it looks like.  Oh, okay.  In terms of...  No one's running away with it yet, is it?  Not yet, but Charlie is in the lead.  Okay.  The guy that started over, how's he doing?  One guy that started over is doing really good.  This is Alex.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's just a drink.  The other guy stopped drinking water? 
[01:28:00]  And the Irish guy just, you know, there's nothing there.  No.  Saving it all for the end.  Can we stop referring to him as the Irish guy?  Think of another way to relate to him.  Everybody else has a name, and he's the Irish guy.  He's just the Irish guy.  We'll call him the drunk guy.  Hey, Bobby wants in here.  Bobby, what's up?  Hello.  Hi, Bobby.  What's up?  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  When I saw my son leave the house today, he told me he was going down to your radio station  to promote the beer for Hudson Valley Brewery Company. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, really?  As I'm listening to the station, I hear his voice.  Plug whore.  Yeah, that was Brian, the one who had an accident.  And that was Brian that dropped his balloon.  Yeah, that's your son?  Yes.  But he didn't tell me he was doing this.  He told me he was going down to promote Hudson Valley Brewery beer.  I did not know he was going to be standing in a pool.  What was that beer again?  Hudson Valley Brewery.  Mom's a plug whore.  Do you own the brewery, ma'am?  His brother does.  His brother does.  Yes.  What, does he make it in the basement?  No, he doesn't.  No, he doesn't.  He actually has beers on the market. 
[01:29:00]  In what market?  Afghanistan?  No, in New York, Hudson Valley.  I've never heard of it.  Throughout the valleys.  Half-handled, Rift and Winkle.  It's a really cool beer.  Or there's five beers.  Is it in the deli case?  I know it's in a lot of locations.  I'm not too sure of where they all are.  I see it all over.  He also just did this Red Bull, but I thought he was going down to promote the beer.  And that's great.  And then I hear that he's standing in a pool with a bunch of guys with a balloon on him.  I'm wondering if that's even her son.  No, it is.  She was probably going to get a Hudson Valley Brewery beer.  No, no.  You can ask him. 
[01:29:30]  Ask him what his mother's name is.  Bobby, I've got a bottle in front of me here.  Bobby, your mom's annoying.  Rift and Winkle is on the tap handle.  It looks like a bottle of root beer.  Yes.  You've got a nice one-pack there.  Yeah, I know.  Where did the other five go?  One warm one in here.  That's how you plug the beer?  You send one down in a six-pack?  One warm one you send.  Oh, Brian.  Brian drank all the others.  Hey, Anthony.  A case.  Anthony likes his beer.  Anthony, why should you taste that one? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, do I have to?  There's a case.  There's cold beers in the fridge.  Bobby, we're going to give you the...  Get a cold one.  Yeah, get a cold one.  I'd like to try a Hudson Valley.  Do you want to try a Hudson Valley?  Bobby, we could either help your son's beer or destroy it at this moment.  Anthony, I want you to be honest.  I'll be honest.  Okay.  This is...  Which one are you drinking?  There's about five or six of us.  Oh, you hold on.  No, the amber wine.  You hold on, Missy.  Do you think Jim Cook did this? 
[01:30:30]  Do you think Jim Cook...  I'm going to go down to a radio station, and I'm going to put on a balloon and try not  to break it.  It's like my great-grandfather used to say.  I guess you don't try to get them out of those kind of things.  There's none left.  They're all warm.  All right, look.  It's cold enough.  I'll try it.  Brian, see how impressive that is?  With the bell, he opened up a bottle of beer.  All right, hold on.  Okay.  I'm getting a little of the aroma.  Oh, boy.  Here we go. 
[01:31:00]  Does it have good nose?  He's trying it.  Okay.  Doesn't really jump out at me.  Okay.  It's not bad.  It's not like I'm going to go...  You know.  It's a rousing endorsement there, huh?  Yeah, they'll use that in the commercial reel.  I don't know.  It's okay.  It's just okay?  That could be their slogan.  It's okay. 
[01:31:30]  Well, I don't think I need a cup.  I'll have to let my son know.  No, I've been drinking out of that.  Would you run out and get a six-pack of this beer, Anthony?  There's other choices I would make.  I think that would make a great logo.  Hudson Valley beer.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Well, like Teddy Roosevelt said, good to the last drop at Maxwell House, and that's how you say it's okay.  Right.  It's okay.  That's good.  That's good. 
[01:32:00]  That's a thumbs up.  That's good.  Thanks.  And if you sell a beer in the hood, it'll be, it's aight.  It's aight.  It's aight.  Does it come in a 40?  No?  No 40s?  I don't know.  Hey, Bobby, you're pretty boring.  We're going to let you go.  Okay.  Thank you.  Dan, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  How's my man Brian doing?  I hear you chopping the balloons in there.  What's going on?  Yeah, Brian's a mess out there with the other guys in the pool.  Oh, man.  I don't even know how to deal with that. 
[01:32:30]  I don't think it's worth it.  I don't think it's worth it.  He's not faring well in the contest for the Xbox.  No, he's in the last place.  Last place.  Is there any confusion here with the Brians?  Do people think that...  That's what I'm wondering.  They think Brian...  Oh, I got the beer, the beer, Brian.  Keep it the beer.  We're going to go hop in a competition.  I think some listeners think Brian's out there trying to fill up a balloon.  Well, that would be odd.  I don't think we'd ever see that.  All right.  Somebody wants to come in and give us a little Christmas gift, I think, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the retarded Laverne.  Oh, fantastic. 
[01:33:00]  Why don't we bring them in and they can meet the Regan brothers.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  What's that?  We're ugly.  We won't shut up and we're noisy, 80.  We're so annoying, no one can take it.  When we look in the mirror to break it.  We'll give you nightmares all day long.  Like a couple of people.  Not a house of friends to peel.  Make a sense for us.  It's not possible. 
[01:33:30]  A warthog and Godzilla in leather pants.  Yes, we're both retarded, retarded.  Yes, we were born that way.  Yes, we're both retarded, retarded.  Make any day.  Turn day.  We won't go away.  Yes, there they are.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  How are you doing?  How are you? 
[01:34:00]  It's Lady Donna.  How have you been?  Hi, Brian.  Hi, Dennis.  Hello.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas to you, too.  Merry Christmas to you.  We're going to be a part of your show.  Oh, yes.  We're going to be up for you, Brian.  Oh, my God.  Great.  Look out of me.  Good.  Hey, Brian, what do you think of the ladies?  I met them last time.  Yeah.  They were on last time.  I was here with you guys.  Dennis, what do you think of the ladies?  I love them.  Thank you so much.  We love you, too.  Thank you.  So, why are you ladies here today? 
[01:34:30]  Oh, we visit to say Merry Christmas.  Oh, Jesus.  Why not?  I like your hat there, the United We Stand hat.  Thank you.  I went to the road show, the Philly show.  I had this hat on.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, when I went out there and, you know, showed off my bathing suit.  You hear?  I have not.  She's always out of breath.  I have not.  When I went out.  She just got here from Philly.  I just picked it up in Philly.  It's chilly out there.  I've been here since 11 o'clock this morning. 
[01:35:00]  Well, great.  Why?  I'm celebrating.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  You've got to tell them.  She is celebrating.  Let her tell you.  What are you celebrating?  I'm divorced now.  Oh.  How long did it take you?  It didn't take long.  A little over a year.  Great.  You're divorced now.  Yes, I am.  And I'm going to go back to my old name.  What's your old name?  That's all right.  You mean your name's not Lady Di? 
[01:35:30]  No, my name won't be Lady Di.  I'm just changing my last name.  That's all.  All right.  And are you guys celebrating by doing a few pops?  A little wobbly pops?  Maybe later.  Yeah.  A little Hudson Valley?  How did you make out?  I'm back on the prowl again.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The New Yorkers, watch out.  I don't know what that means.  Imagine Jerseys, watch out, too.  Back on the prowl again.  I have no clue what that means.  What do you mean by the prowl?  What are you looking for?  You're looking for a boyfriend. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, or a date.  Or a picture of the guy.  Now, how did you make out in your divorce?  Financially, how did you make out?  Financially?  Yeah.  A few thousand dollars.  A few thousand dollars.  He's got some gold around her neck.  Oh, now, that's her bling-bling.  That's her bling-bling, Brian.  That's her bling-bling.  She did all right in this divorce, man.  You got...  Brian, don't let it deceive you. 
[01:36:30]  That around her neck is thinner than the foil that yoles around her neck.  It's some of the worst jewelry.  Hey, we heard the homeless shopping spree the other day.  You guys were funny.  Those guys were funny.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Where'd you find them at?  Hey, Lady Di, I want you to get to meet them.  Why don't you show Brian your bling-bling and how thin it is?  Look how thin it is.  She's got to be careful because it's going to bend.  It's not going to break.  It bends in the wind.  It'll break.  No, it won't.  I'll show them.  Hold on.  Let me see that.  It looks pretty good. 
[01:37:00]  It looks kind of...  You like them, do you?  We're lighting up for you guys.  You too.  Your agent said it was okay.  Oh, yeah.  What are you going to do?  Are you going to be at Caroline's?  We'll be there tomorrow night, I guess.  Yeah, we'll be there tonight.  Maybe before Caroline's.  I don't know.  Do us a favor.  Do not yell out jokes or punchlines tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  No, because I heard you did that to Colin Quinn when you saw him at the cellar.  No, you know what happened?  Somebody's cell phone went off while he was doing the show, and I said it was kind of  rude for somebody's cell phone to go off.  The person who shut the cell phone off, that's all. 
[01:37:30]  The cell phone should be shut off.  And he said, and you know what he said to me?  Thank you, honey.  Colin did from the stage, so I acknowledged that.  Thank you, honey, for leaving.  It's kind of rude for somebody's cell phone to be on when you're at a comedy club.  Come on.  Yeah, you're right.  All right.  Are you guys checking out the guys outside the studio in the contest?  No.  Well, no, not really.  We saw the hot dogs out there.  We saw some of them.  The hot dogs?  We saw some of them.  Isn't that what you're on the prowl for, Lady Di?  Let me tell you.  They're kind of small. 
[01:38:00]  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  Well.  I think they are.  Why?  What are you used to, Mary?  We're a certain age.  So when we're a certain age, you're kind of small.  Mary, what are you used to?  What?  You're used to something a little larger?  Somebody that's over 35.  Me, too.  No, I mean something.  That's age.  That's not age.  Well, I mean.  That's age, not small.  Well, Mary, are you used to something a little bigger, I'm saying?  Yeah.  Oh, your husband, you're saying, is in doubt?  I'm not saying no.  Well, you've already said your husband is bigger than the guys that are out there, and some are ending. 
[01:38:30]  It just never ends.  You do.  You always sound like you're out of breath.  No, I don't know.  I'm going to sit up or something, Lady Di.  Okay.  Okay.  If you're on the prowl, let me, let me, I'm going to be a little honest with you.  Look at Mary.  She's lost weight.  Mary's lost some weight.  She's got her, her perm grew out.  Not as much.  She's gone to the parlor and had it done at the parlor.  I'm trying to lose more.  The beauty parlor.  The beauty parlor.  The beauty parlor.  You've got to lose some of what, Marion? 
[01:39:00]  The bunt.  Yeah, of course.  The bunt?  The lady Di, if you're on the prowl.  Yes, I'm on the prowl.  I exercise.  Let me tell you, I saw those, I saw those pictures of you, Lady Di, when you were, when  you were in your teens.  Yeah.  Remember you brought those in?  Early 20s.  Right, early 20s.  Early 20s.  And how much did you weigh back then?  Be honest.  I would say like 130 pounds.  Not, not even.  It looked like you were a slender gal.  You looked like one of the, you looked like one of those girls that were a guaranteed lay  if you drank enough at the end of the night. 
[01:39:30]  Even if you didn't drink enough at the end of the night.  You want to tell him about Louisiana?  Nice.  You want to tell him about it?  No, they know.  About what?  These guys.  Louisiana.  Pavarotti?  No, they've got a Pavarotti announcement they want to make.  They're coming up with us.  People would like you to meet her.  What?  She's a very nice person.  There's a third member of this gang?  She's a friend of Diane's.  A friend of mine.  We just got her hooked on you guys.  Long hair, young girl.  She's very, very nice.  You'll like her.  Oh, nice.  It's like the fifth beetle. 
[01:40:00]  You'll like her.  Yeah.  Is she hot?  She is.  Yes, she is.  Jim Norton knows her.  Uh-oh.  Enough said right there.  She's got the hiv.  Where is Jim today anyway?  Uh, he had some doctor's appointments or something.  Oh, okay.  Uh-oh.  That's not bad.  As long as he's okay?  Uh, the T-cells are coming back up.  The who?  The white?  The T-cells?  The ladies, the comedians are pouring with you.  No, man.  No, no, no.  I just want to say to him.  What, uh...  We were out there.  We were out there.  Brian, we were out there keeping your agent company. 
[01:40:30]  You keep saying our agent.  Our agent is weird.  I don't know who you're saying.  Did somebody know how to say he's our agent?  What are you talking about?  He's not.  We don't have an agent.  Marian, what are you talking about?  He's such one of the homeless guys.  It was actually from Caroline.  I don't want you to feel bad.  So, he was your agent and your agent.  Well, he's with the...  Ladies, ladies, ladies, be quiet because Brian had something to ask you.  I just want to know what, uh, you guys travel, you tour?  What is your... 
[01:41:00]  We can't imagine they're really like this.  It's got to be an act, right?  We can travel, yeah.  What is your act?  Well, she works in a brewery and she moves, uh, what, death around?  Furniture.  Furniture.  She can't say the word, but she moves it.  Furniture.  Furniture.  Furniture.  Furniture.  Furniture.  I thought it was like a show.  I thought you guys had a show or something.  We do.  No, you know something, Brian?  What?  Don't they look like it should be a show?  Like, it's almost like a retro Lucy Ethel thing that's going on there? 
[01:41:30]  I'd be there.  We can be a show.  Only they both look like Fred Murch.  We can.  I'd be sitting there on this with my cell phone going off.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  Have her yell at you.  We can come up with an act.  I'm sure you could.  I'm sure it'd be great.  I want you guys to come up with an act and we'll put it on our show.  Hey, can you do that?  17 cities.  17 cities.  Right.  17 cities.  And have a live show.  We can have them come out and do some time.  We don't know.  We've got to get to Christmas.  All right.  After Christmas, we'll figure it out.  All right.  Okay.  Very good.  All right.  So, thank you, ladies, I guess.  Could you just lay down in a road? 
[01:42:00]  You're welcome.  Maybe.  Have a holiday.  Your friend does come up here.  Is it okay if she comes in and says hi?  No.  No, we want to know if it's okay if you guys just want to say hi or not.  No, I don't think so.  I think I'd like to see her.  I'd like to know.  Bill, yous would like her.  O.P. Anthony?  Yous would like her.  Trust me on this one.  Yous would like her.  Yous would like her.  Yous guys would like her?  Why would wes like her?  Because you're one.  Why?  Why?  What does she look like?  Describe her.  Tell us about her. 
[01:42:30]  Pitch it.  Who's would like her?  A shapely girl, young girl.  How old is young?  Shapely is vague.  Are you trying to tell us that her poofs haven't dropped yet?  She's in her 20s.  Everyone has a shape.  Yeah.  She's shapely.  Great.  No, she's a wafer thin and she's on two dimensions.  She's very thin.  Okay.  She's thin.  She's in her 20s.  What does she do?  What does she do?  She's part of the act.  You don't know?  You're friends with her, but you don't know what her job is or what she does.  To her on the internet. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, she's an internet friend.  All right.  Her name is Sam.  No, she's party girl 56.  Have you ever seen her?  Yeah.  She went with us at Caroline two weeks ago.  She was with us.  What?  She's upstairs.  They're going to bring her down.  Oh, okay.  Well, we meet her now.  Why don't you guys tell us that she was with you?  Well, that's what we're trying to tell you.  She was up there talking to her agent.  You know something?  We're just waiting for 20 minutes on this.  To me, it sounded like they want to bring her in someday in the future. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  We're trying to tell you.  You didn't tell me she was here.  Old Lucy.  Wait a minute.  I was like, next time we're here, we'll bring her.  I just said she's around the block.  She's on her way here.  She's on her way up.  Oh.  So she's here now.  Yeah.  All right.  It's just that she has, she had a way.  She had to take a later train.  While we wait for your friend to come down, do you have a question for Brian or Dennis?  Are you guys going to be performing in February at Caroline's?  We're trying to plug this weekend.  See, this is real.  What about Mario Cantone?  I'd love to meet Mario Cantone. 
[01:44:00]  I really would.  Mario is great.  He's a very good guy.  I really would love to meet him.  Yeah.  But do you have a question for Brian?  He would be so thankful.  Here's Mario Cantone's address.  Are you guys doing an act together?  What is it?  Go ahead.  Tell me.  Oh, my God.  We're on the same, we're not on stage at the same time.  He does his and then I do mine.  Oh, okay.  What about New Year's Eve?  Who's their New Year's Eve?  Well, they're not a commercial.  They're going to be a guy from Caroline's downstairs that said he was our agent.  They're going to be... 
[01:44:30]  Jesus Christ, you retards.  Do you understand something?  Do you understand that they're going to be at Caroline's this weekend?  How do you know that?  But they're not experts on them.  They don't know.  They're doing something.  They're not going to talk about...  All right.  Come in here.  Who are you?  Now, who the hell are you?  Shapely.  Is this like when they try to bring that Oliver kid into the Brady Bunch to boost ratings?  The retarded Laverne and Shirley were doing well, but now you need like a younger... 
[01:45:00]  Wow.  They make this one look like a supermodel.  Hey, what the hell is your name?  Hello.  You know something?  Let me tell you something.  You've got a great strategy.  You hang out with these two, you're going to look like a goddamn supermodel.  What's your name?  Luciana.  Oh, you said that, didn't you?  You're Luciana.  And you met these two on the Internet?  How did you meet these two?  On the net.  On the net.  What the hell were you doing on the Internet?  In what chat room?  The old message board chat room.  That's great.  My ambition to be cut up and put in a 55-gallon drum on the side of the highway. 
[01:45:30]  That's why you go on the Internet.  There are kooks on there.  Look at who you met.  These two.  Look how scared she is.  Let me say.  You all right?  She's shy.  Why are you shy?  What's the matter?  She knows Jim Norton very good, but she's shy.  Oh, she knows Norton very well.  That's great.  Does that mean that something might have happened?  No.  No.  Far from it.  Okay.  All right.  Well, you don't already see some parts of the disease showing themselves now.  She'd been intimate with Jim Norton.  And Steve has informed us there are pictures of her on Foundry.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:46:00]  Right.  Naked and stuff?  What?  I wowed.  You wowed?  You wowed.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Very nice.  All right.  Well, we'll punch that up.  And Foundry?  You like how you want to do still?  Foundrymusic.com.  It's our website.  They're okay?  Yeah, they're fun.  They are fun.  They don't scare you?  No.  No.  Does she yell, yin-yang party and phrases like that?  Oh, you do?  Brian, that's their catchphrase.  That's what you wanted a friend.  That's their catchphrase.  They go around going, yin-yang party.  Yin-yang party.  I like it.  That's a catchphrase.  Well, do it for the guys.  Come on, sir. 
[01:46:30]  Yin-yang party.  Oh, my God.  They found another one.  They found a victim.  Brian, do you have a catchphrase?  No.  No.  It's yin-yang party.  I had yin-yang have fun, but party just hardly encapsulates it.  So what the hell are you doing hanging out with these two?  She went with the Caroline.  Two weeks ago.  Why doesn't she talk?  Her head shakes like Michael J. Fox, and she doesn't...  What are you doing?  She's their spokesperson.  Are you nervous, or you got a disease?  Yeah.  No, I'm nervous. 
[01:47:00]  You're shaking and everything.  Loosen up.  Everything's cool.  Just hang.  Quack.  Quack.  Quack.  If I don't know any better, I would think I'm looking at Charlie's Angels Anthony.  That's so good.  Wow.  On bizarro planet.  That's Kevin.  The other two.  Marion is para-forsy.  Did you have a sexual intercourse with Jim Norton?  No.  No.  No.  That's the only thing Norton doesn't like to work. 
[01:47:30]  That's a pertinent question.  All right.  Well...  Oh.  She just wound.  Wait, let me see.  What happened?  I'm looking the other way.  She's flashing.  Look at the...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All righty.  Marion, go ahead.  Show that you're luscious.  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right, lady.  Go ahead.  Show the boys.  Look at these.  Yeah!  Stinky loves it.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  And those things will be on the prowl.  They almost Caroline. 
[01:48:00]  This weekend.  They almost dropped to the floor.  With the bling-bling.  I'm on the prowl again.  With the bling-bling.  Bling-bling-bling.  If you're single, don't die in.  They bounced all the way down the ground, bounced back up, and almost knocked Brian out.  That's great.  I like Marion's, though.  You know what, Marion?  Marion doesn't show them often.  But you know why I like yours?  They remind me of...  You ever drive upstate and you see two silos that have fallen down?  I swear.  That's a good thing, Marion.  They're huge torpedoes.  Marion, what do you say?  It's been a long... 
[01:48:30]  Oh, lady, die.  Stop it.  I'm big, Buster.  So what?  All right.  What do you say, though?  That's good.  I'm big, Buster.  I'm proud of my Buster.  I'm proud of my Buster.  I'm proud of my Buster.  I'm proud of my Buster.  Marion, what do you say?  What do you say?  Brian, have you realized one says something and the other one's got to jump in and say  the same thing?  I'm proud of them, too.  I'm proud of them, too.  Wow.  Oh, man.  I feel like I'm upstate looking at some silos.  Right?  Those are fantastic.  Wow.  Those are fantastic.  I'm proud of my Buster.  They've completely lost any cylindrical shape they might have once had. 
[01:49:00]  I love it.  God are you hot, Marion.  You are so hot.  I've lost about 10 pounds off the hair.  Oh, yeah?  Off your boobs alone?  Yeah, I did.  How do you target just the one area like that?  Just the boob area.  No, no.  Do they have a machine for that?  Yeah.  I did.  That's fantastic.  I can't believe how free and loose these girls are these days.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to lose more up here.  Are you on the prowl, Marion, or are you still married?  No.  I'm married. 
[01:49:30]  My husband's home.  I'm married, Anthony.  I'm married.  My husband's home right now, trying to put his head in that oven and just turn that gas on.  He's home Christmas shopping.  He's home Christmas shopping.  Home Christmas shopping.  See, Brian, you can't write stuff like that.  He's home Christmas shopping.  He's going from room to room.  Let me look in the fridge.  I don't know.  Anyone need an egg or buy a gift in the dining room?  You guys go shopping on the Internet?  Toilet paper.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:50:00]  There was something on the Internet the other day that we were going to order, but I didn't,  but he might have.  Why?  I'm not saying well, because it was for somebody.  It wasn't for me.  It was for somebody.  Do you believe this?  Do you believe the stuff you hear coming out of these two?  Wow, that's fascinating Internet shopping.  If you go to a store, you don't find what you're looking for in a store.  You go on a computer.  I find it on the Internet.  So, hey, I got a computer, and you find it on the computer.  Wow.  When did I get one of those stores?  Unbelievably real.  When did I get one of those computers?  Yeah.  It started, what, a couple of years ago, right? 
[01:50:30]  Really?  Yeah.  A couple of years ago.  It's online buying, you're saying?  Yeah, wait a second.  You get on the computer, and you buy things?  How does that happen?  You can do that.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  So, you can do it with Pong?  With a Pong machine, I think you can buy stuff with that, too.  As long as you have a credit card.  What?  You guys shop on the Internet?  Nah, too busy looking at porn.  Porno.  Well, you guys might probably shop for videos on the Internet.  See, that's some of the stuff you'll be hearing.  I've been looking at porno once in a while. 
[01:51:00]  What's one looking at porno?  So do I.  So do I.  She's got to chime in.  So do I.  Lady Dere, we don't care.  What is wrong?  We like Marion.  What is wrong looking at porno?  These two used to go to the peep shows in New York.  Yep, together.  We were about 20 years old.  Yeah.  It's back in the day.  We did.  You would look at the girls?  No.  No.  They had guys.  They had guys.  Girls and guys.  Girls and saran wrap.  What?  I don't understand the saran wrap part.  Remember?  Maybe I had cataracts. 
[01:51:30]  What's the saran wrap?  It looked like they were in saran wrap.  Oh, that was the old movie.  You saw it.  What?  That was the old movie.  Hey, Manhattan.  The old Manhattan.  All right, back in the old days.  All right.  Well, once you give the mic back to Rick, we've got to check out on the contestants.  Give the mic back and, I don't know, jump out a window or something, whatever you feel  like you want to do.  I'm going to be doing my show in saran wrap tonight.  At Caroline's.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  What are you doing, sir?  He just came in and poured a beer in my cup. 
[01:52:00]  I don't know who this guy is.  Make sure it's beer and not...  That's why.  I'm not accepting beer from anybody.  There's men holding junk and doing things.  I'm not even touching that cup.  Hey, Rick, what's going on outside?  All right.  Quick update.  Yeah.  Dan, the guy who was leading...  What?  What happened?  Oh, Marion.  Marion.  Oh, God.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley are in there.  Go.  Push him in the pool.  Go over there. 
[01:52:30]  Go.  Brian, that was just the way they are.  All right.  I swear to you.  Quick update.  Dan, who was leading, filled up his balloon a little bit more, and then he decided to tie  off.  I think he's just going to hold it for the next 50 minutes to see if maybe he can win  and hold out.  Was anyone close to him?  Good strategy.  Good strategy.  Another guy has done the same thing.  And Tom, and he almost spilled it on everybody, Joe lost it again.  Joe lost it once earlier.  He dropped his again.  So he's on his third balloon. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  Well, just the courage to finish.  The courage to finish and continue like that.  You're not backing out.  You're not quitting.  Is there a time?  Yeah, we've got less than an hour at this point.  Then we've got in the other pool, we've got Charlie, who he looks like he's about even  right now at Dan, but I'm not sure because, again, he's doing the Al Bundy thing.  So it's down to, what, three guys, four guys?  It's still an ongoing competition because a couple of guys haven't tied off yet. 
[01:53:30]  One guy over here, Justin, is filling up, but we don't know exactly how much he has compared  to the other guys because his are hidden in his underwear as well.  Oh.  All right.  There we go.  Well, it's coming down to the end here.  Hold on.  One guy had a question.  Yeah.  For you guys.  Okay.  I'm sure this is going to be great.  Hey, man, I've got to take off, man.  I was wondering if you can just weigh me now because I'm not going to get that extra hour  to fill in anymore, so I've got to take off.  Where do you have to go?  Where do you have to go? 
[01:54:00]  Where do I have to go?  If I want to get back to Delaware, I've got to leave.  Oh.  Well, he's bowing out, Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, not holding my dumpster in front of other guys, but whatever.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So he's going to tie off and he's going to leave it behind.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break.  Thank you, Rick.  All right.  Wayne from the Poconos about the retarded Laverne and Shirley is wondering if you kill one,  will the other one die of loneliness?  Like in the animal kingdom, sometimes that happens.  That's something I would like to try out. 
[01:54:30]  Can we get that experiment working?  Can someone just club one of them over the head with a bat and see what happens to the  other one?  God.  All right.  Brian Regan in the studio playing Caroline tonight.  Dennis Regan in the studio also playing Caroline tonight.  Dennis Regan on Letterman tonight as well.  Yeah.  So we'll be back with those two, okay?  Dean from D.C.  Oh, my God.  I've waited months to hear Regan on your show, and those effing pigs ate up their time.  No, no.  We'll do another thing.  Of course.  We'll do another thing next, okay?  A holiday message from our big boss, Anthony.  Yes.  Here it is.  And now, a holiday message from Oakley and Anthony Go General Manager, Ken Stevens. 
[01:55:00]  I don't care no more.  Okay?  My life is over.  I will kill anybody.  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head and shoot all these motherfuckers.  You know, I'll shoot myself.  I guess I'll quit.  I'm a f***er.  I'm trying to take a nap.  You know, f***er.  Happy holidays from all of us at the Opie and Anthony Go.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes, but don't come here for the news. 
[01:55:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like it when this show's dirty.  A lot of people around the joint today, huh, Anthony?  Yeah.  Got Brian Regan in the studio.  Dennis Regan, his brother, in the studio.  Both playing Carolines this weekend.  Dennis should get to the top billing today.  He's on Letterman tonight, Anthony.  That's pretty good. 
[01:56:00]  Pretty big stuff there.  I'm used to seeing Brian on Letterman.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll have to do it a few more times, I think, before he gets out to us.  Is this your first time?  Second time.  Second time?  Okay.  Very cool.  We look forward to checking that out tonight as well.  Does he talk about, oh, and you're Brian Regan's brother.  No, he didn't mention him.  No?  I really don't think he's aware of Brian.  Ouch.  Yeah, that hurt.  Letterman's been on fire lately, too.  Yeah, man.  It's great. 
[01:56:30]  I really enjoy his show.  I enjoy him.  Ever since the surgery.  Ever since the little heart thing.  Yeah.  It seems like he doesn't give a crap anymore.  That's a great attitude.  He doesn't care what people think, and he's just going with it.  What a great attitude to him.  There's like a happy-go-luckiness to it, you know?  Yeah.  I don't even know what that means, but I just felt like saying it.  You're not happy-go-lucky these days at all?  You've got to be happy-go-lucky.  Happy-go-lucky.  And you haven't liked the studio yet, right?  Hell no.  It is just an absolute mess outside the studio.  You've got guys pretty much, they're kind of naked, I guess. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, God.  Standing in little kiddie pools together, and they're doing this contest.  This is another show that I will not be leaving this studio until everyone's cleared out.  And then Karen Silkwood, the whole studio.  Right.  Exactly.  There's like pressure cleaners in there.  Yeah.  We had a radio bit go horribly wrong last Friday.  Yeah?  What was that?  We did this bit called, What the Hell is That?  So we had people come in with stuff they had on their body that they weren't sure what it was. 
[01:57:30]  Maybe they didn't think it was serious enough to go to a doctor.  Maybe they don't have a medical plan.  Maybe they're afraid to go because it's serious and they want to get some kind of a diagnosis on our show first.  And we were having a lot of laughs.  It was fun.  We brought in doctors.  We brought in actual doctors.  And we had people come in and say, Hey, what is this?  You know, and people would be like, That's just a skin tag.  It can be removed by a dermatologist.  It's no problem.  And this was fun.  This was the fun part.  It was fun.  Yeah.  Because no one was really getting hurt. 
[01:58:00]  Because that skin tag was on a guy's yam bag, if I may call it that.  And just the fact that he had to pull down his pants and show this lady doctor who was on Temptation Island.  Remember that show?  No, you don't.  Look at that TV.  They don't watch TV.  Is it on the television?  Yeah, that thing that plays Pong.  The TV.  It's on the microwave.  Then we had a guy.  He always sweat on half his face.  Oh, man.  What did they say that was? 
[01:58:30]  It's either nothing or a brain tumor.  It really gave him a great diagnosis.  You have a semi-nervous tendency.  Yeah, they were very vague with him.  But when he eats hot food, only half his face sweats.  And we had him eat hot wings.  And the right side of his face was dripping.  He was sweating so hard.  And then when he works out, he sweats on the other side.  Only on the other side of the face.  Kind of strange.  They said, Perhaps you should check it out.  Yeah, that's the kind of thing you'd want to go down to the doctor's office.  So that was fun.  So then this guy comes... 
[01:59:00]  Matt!  You can already hold the liter of water for every 20 minutes.  Rick, what's going on?  One of our co-leaders, Charlie...  Oh!  He's throwing up!  What?  He's puking!  Why is he puking?  Wasn't that part of the contest?  Why don't we bring that into the mix?  Maybe he's trying to get the other guys out of the pool, because they have to stay in the pool.  Holy cow!  Another bit going horribly wrong, man.  Did he say?  Who saw that?  He's yakked three times now in a row. 
[01:59:30]  Ask him why he's puking.  Because he drank too much water.  Hey, Charlie, why are you yakking, man?  Too much water.  Too much water.  I've heard of too much alcohol.  Yeah, why?  Man, I've been pounding the water.  I must have had a quart of water.  So, dude, I drank all this water, and I'm like driving.  You know, I shouldn't be.  Are you going to do it again, dude?  What's that?  You're not going to do it again, aren't you?  All right, so then...  Are the other guys still in the pool?  Yeah, he's just hoping I didn't do it that time.  The other guys are still in the pool, and I don't have to leave. 
[02:00:00]  That must be a good Xbox.  Yeah.  So then Brian...  I'll just turn these down for a little bit.  So then this guy walks off the street.  He said he was on the train this morning, and he was licking his lips or something, and it felt a little bump.  He goes, yeah, I'm licking my lip inside by my gum, and I feel a little bump.  So we go, okay, well, let the doctor take a look.  The doctor goes, first thing, are you a smoker?  He goes, yeah.  Thirty-four-year-old guy.  So we're like, since he was 16. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  So the doctors, they all pull out their little flashlights, and one takes a quick look, and he backed away, looked at us with that face like, uh-oh.  Oh, we weren't expecting to see this today.  Like a horror movie.  Yeah, his face.  I read his face.  It said, oh, my God, I've seen this before.  I've seen this exact thing.  I know exactly what it looks like.  One doctor didn't want any part of it, and he was holding up his fingers, so his thumb and pointer finger made the letter C. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, and the guy starts going, Jesus Christ, tell me what it is.  We had a cut.  Yeah, a cut.  Sure.  He started panicking.  Who do I see right now?  It was bad.  Yeah, and he sat down, and then they were feeling and going, well, any solid mass in the mouth should be checked out.  I would see a doctor, and he said, when should I go?  And they said, yesterday.  It was that serious.  Serious.  And, boy, it took all the fun of the half-faced sweaty guy right out of the whole thing. 
[02:01:30]  It might knock the wind out of the staph infections.  They're like, oh, cancer.  Ha, ha, ha, that's the funniest guy.  Oh, good.  Yeah, it was really bad.  They told us after the fact that it pretty much is the worst form, the head and neck cancer.  Yeah, yeah.  It really took me.  We don't know for sure, though, and we haven't heard from the guy since, and we're hoping he'll call us.  Yeah, call us up there, guys.  Let's hope it's not.  So, Brian, I'm noticing that you're not wearing glasses.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:02:00]  That's right.  Follow that, funny boy.  I'm sitting here sweating on half of my face.  Yeah.  Now, if you usually get glasses, you've got to go to a doctor first, some sort of eye doctor thing.  No, I just, I don't know.  Do you guys wear contacts?  No.  I got the laser eye thing.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I see 2015.  I used to wear the contacts, if that helps the bit.  Man, that's cool.  You see 2015, but you can't see the other numbers at all?  Yeah, in the year 2015, I'm going to be very successful. 
[02:02:30]  Before that, I'm not going to know what's going on.  2015 is my year.  Call me now.  That's very funny.  2014, I want to know what the hell's going on.  That's funny.  I'm wearing, I got trifocals, which is, that's the new thing.  I don't know if it's new or not.  I hadn't been in a while.  The doctor goes, you want to try trifocals?  And I'm like, I don't know what that is.  He goes, it's what you would think, you know.  You can see at three different distances, depending on where you look through the lens. 
[02:03:00]  You can see close or medium or far away.  And I'm like, I can't even imagine getting used to that, you know.  There's a book.  There's a plane.  There's Alpha Centauri.  Do people need that kind of range?  Is that a fly in my nose?  Is that a comet?  Hey, do you need to see everything?  Because these doctors, you know.  I mean, like this guy with, I don't know, with the C.  I go to my dentist and he tells me to relax my lower lip.  What the hell is that?  Relax your lower lip. 
[02:03:30]  So I'm trying, and now he's getting frustrated.  He's going, now you're tensing it.  I need for you to relax it.  I'm trying to find the brain cell that can do that.  Oh, there we go.  Let me just lay it on my chest for you.  Give me a nice wide open work area.  What the hell are you talking about?  Relax.  How do you relax your lower lip?  What are you, tuck it in your shirt pocket?  Sometimes you just want to relax.  Sometimes you just want to sit back and relax.  You know what I'm saying?  Trifocals, are you 80? 
[02:04:00]  Trifocals, they have them, man.  I have, I wear quadraphonic focals.  Quadrafocals.  Quadrafocals.  Look to the sides and see something else.  I just turned, I just turned 46, which concerns me because when I was 23, I had a midlife crisis.  I got carded at a nightclub, I got carded in Los Angeles, they were just checking everybody's ID.  You know, I wouldn't be like, you know, an idiot enough to be flat.  And really, you don't think I look old enough to have a drink.  But I was annoyed because I had to go back in my car and get my ID. 
[02:04:30]  But since then, I was someplace where they make fake IDs and I had one made up that says I'm 21.  Yeah, it's got my picture on it and everything.  I've used it a couple of times to see if the doorman catches it.  I get like three days of gray beard popping out.  Yeah, that's right, I'm 21.  Yeah.  I was born in March of 1980.  I've had a hard life.  Don't make it any harder, just open the damn door.  I want to see what beer tastes like.  I've heard it's delicious. 
[02:05:00]  That's what the elders say.  The elders know what they're talking about.  They're wise.  Have you seen this sign?  I saw a sign in a bar, above the bar that said,  We will not serve alcohol to anyone who appears intoxicated.  This is in a bar.  When I was a teenager, I had to fake sober for my dad a couple of times.  Now I got to do it for the damn bar.  Yeah, just so I can get another drink in me, you know.  I'm in the bathroom, splashing water on my face, rehearsing my line, you know.  You can do it, Daddy, just concentrate. 
[02:05:30]  Concentrate as hard as you can.  Tequila!  I like a tequila!  For me!  I'm very distracted by this contest outside.  Steve, are you getting good stuff?  Look, Steve's disgusted.  He don't like this stuff.  No, I'm not.  He put his camera away.  He doesn't like a camera gun, man.  That's when you know the bits.  This has gone horribly wrong.  First of all, it only involves guys, which sucks.  Then secondly, there's now puke involved. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  We know what that's all about.  We've had contests that do involve just puke.  And I've seen no one whipped anything out and started tinkling anywhere on that contest.  So why should we have a puking guy during this?  Anthony, it's very exciting.  We only have 28 minutes left in this very long contest.  Jesus.  Coming down to the wire, man.  Coming down to the wire.  Rick?  Yeah.  How's it going out?  In the stretch.  Interesting developments in the last 10 minutes, guys.  Oh, my God.  Have they gotten Osama bin Laden? 
[02:06:30]  Oh, you mean in the contest?  Yeah, in the contest.  We're going to stick with the contest.  Tom is now out.  Why?  I think he was on his third balloon, and he just was about to break again.  He gave up.  He gave up.  Dave, of course, you know, from Delaware, he's on his way home.  Alex is now out as well.  What happened there?  He was about to...  It was the idiot with the zipper.  Where is he?  There he is.  Ah, ripped on the zipper.  He keeps ripping balloons on his zipper.  One ripped, and the other one I couldn't get back on.  Right.  Oh, well.  So now he's out, and now Joe just walked out as well, the guy who was on his third balloon as well. 
[02:07:00]  All right, so who's left?  All right, so in one pool, we still have four contestants.  Charlie...  Yeah, but I saw some of the contestants.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  Most of those guys don't even have a chance.  Well, that's neither here nor there.  We do have 26 minutes left.  Unless they're really holding back.  I think a couple of them are holding back.  Okay.  So we've got Charlie, who looks like he's now taking the lead over Dan.  Now, how big is his balloon at this point, Rick?  It's tough to tell because he's got it in his pants, but let's just say it looks like he has elephantitis. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  You know, he's hiding.  He's hiding what he's done so far, so the others don't know.  Is that the strategy?  It looks like it.  Well, I started it this way, and now I'm kind of stuck.  Oh, now he can't.  It's going to be easy.  What is he getting it out of my shorts?  Yeah, how do you do that?  Yeah, Rick, how is he going to get it out of his pants?  He's still going to try and figure that out.  I think he says he's going to just try and lose his shorts.  Yeah, rip the shorts, right?  Then we've got Paul. 
[02:08:00]  Yo, man, the other guy just puked all over me.  Yeah, we know.  We talked about this.  Yeah, what's up?  Thanks, Paul.  How much puke is in the kiddie pool?  There's a fair amount of puke.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, they threw a bunch of towels on it, but it was about a liter of water of puke.  Oh, God.  Maybe a little more.  Scientific measurement on that.  How about a 1.3 liters of yackety-yack in liters?  Then we've got Kevin with his Calvin Klein. 
[02:08:30]  He looks like one of those guys at a strip club or something.  I don't know.  Is Rachel enjoying the festivities out there?  Rachel is avoiding all contact with these guys as much as possible.  And then you've got Brian, the beer guy that his mom called.  Yeah, great.  How's he doing?  He's just horrible.  Yeah.  Horrible.  I think he came just to promote the beer.  Yeah, he's promoting the family beer business.  And he's got to plug in for the family beer.  And then in the left pool, we still have Dan, who tied off early. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  And Irish Jay.  All right, Rick, tell these guys they've got 25 minutes left.  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, we're going to end the contest.  All right, 25 minutes, guys.  So no longer water.  Drink your water now, all right?  Let it roll.  All right.  As we go to break, people want to hear the fake commercial for the talking Jim Norton doll, Anthony.  Yeah, we're going to play this again.  So check this out.  Hey, kids.  Just in time for Christmas, it's the Jim Norton talking doll.  Guys.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show.  And you've probably seen him receiving yellow discipline in cheap motels. 
[02:09:30]  Shut up, stupid.  Now you can bring him home.  Just squeeze his mule and let the sparks fly.  Don't you want to make a poignant statement, you ass.  Made entirely of recycled rubbers and stuffed with nails and broken glass,  the talking Jim Norton doll is fun for everyone in the family, even mom.  Just keep filleting your husband until he pays the bills.  Oh, that Jim.  What will he say next?  You talk like foghorn leghorn.  Shut up.  It's an educational toy, too.  Who better to learn about the birds and the bees than from Uncle Jim? 
[02:10:00]  It's not rape if they blink twice for yes.  Comes complete with martini glass, shaker, and vial of urine.  Some assembly required.  Shut your yaps.  New from Stinko.  It's the Jim Norton talking doll.  You stink.  Available where Megan's law doesn't apply.  Oh, Anthony, I've just been informed that Brian and Dennis have to, uh...  They gotta go.  They gotta go.  We gotta do the thing tonight.  Oh, that thing.  The thing.  The thing over at the thing.  You guys weren't having fun?  Well, we had fun.  I mean, good time. 
[02:10:30]  I hope being here.  Is there a problem or anything?  Well, no.  Okay.  I think it was wonderful.  It was fine.  You sure?  Yeah.  I feel like we want a good host.  Usually the guests don't leave.  I usually get something to eat.  Oh.  You want us to make you up a plate?  Could I get a baked potato and a grilled cheese sandwich?  So the family member that can't make it to the big Thanksgiving or something, make  them up a plate.  That's great.  No, it was nice meeting you guys.  You guys are great.  Dennis Regan's going to be on Letterman tonight, and he's playing with Brian Regan at the Caroline's  all this weekend.  Come by whenever you want, even by yourself. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, feel free.  Thanks.  I was talking to Brian.  Oh.  I'm kidding.  Of course.  I'm kidding.  Stop it.  All right, guys.  It's always a pleasure.  Thank you, guys, man.  And good luck to whoever out there wins the whole next part.  That's why you're leaving.  We're not going to shake your hands as we leave.  No shaking.  You're smart.  Put your hands in your pockets and walk fast.  You don't want to be here for the grand finale that is coming next.  Exactly.  Caroline.  Yeah, it's Brian Regan and Dennis Regan.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Opie.  Opie.  And Anthony.  Anthony. 
[02:11:30]  At the last supper, they would have wiped their asses with the tablecloth.  That's just what Christ wanted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  You're trying to get a hold of us in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  Please call us.  866-277-4.  Wow.  That's 866-277-4.  Wow.  Anthony, we have a little over ten minutes left in the contest for the Xbox. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  It's kind of been a side little contest that we've been doing in the background.  Thank God.  Yeah, I am so glad this didn't require us to be out there at any time.  I'll tell you, it forced us to prepare for our show today.  Yeah, it did.  As if we had nothing going on today, we would have had to do something with this outside the studio.  No.  We've got guys.  They've got their balloons.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Uh-huh.  They're drinking a lot of water.  They've got to fill up the balloons.  And the person that fills up the balloon the most will win an Xbox, right? 
[02:12:30]  Right.  Uh, it's a close competition right now.  I think it's down to about four guys that have a chance at the Xbox.  They're standing in little kiddie pools out there, of which a couple of guys have dropped their balloons after they had started.  So there's some of that in the pool.  And then one guy who drank too much water started puking up the water in the pool.  I had to check it out, Anthony, the puke.  Yeah.  There's no, it's just water.  It's just water.  Well, still, you know, it was in some guy's stomach. 
[02:13:00]  And if you're keeping track at home, Anthony still has not left the studio today.  No, I could win this contest if I let go right now.  Because I have not gone anywhere.  Well, let's just put it this way.  It looks like you're sitting on a hoppy hop right now.  Yeah, yeah.  A slush, slush when I rock back and forth.  All right.  Rick.  Yo.  What's going on?  All right.  We are now down to five contestants.  We just had Brian, the guy with his mom on the phone.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:13:30]  Rick.  Ah.  We had a dumb bell.  He dropped his balloon again.  Yeah, okay.  So now we're down to five.  All right.  And now Stinky has just decided since he's bored he's going to start tormenting these guys.  So he's got a lot of water.  He keeps boring from one container to the next.  Oh, good.  Yeah, but it's not a contest of who can hold it.  Well, you never know.  They just keep filling up. 
[02:14:00]  Well, are we ready for the grand finale?  I think so, yeah.  To make it a little tougher for the last ten minutes?  Some of these guys that have been holding it in, that might have been the wrong thing to do.  Right.  Because we have the surprise grand finale for the guys.  Yeah.  Rick?  Yep.  If you will.  The girls are now coming out.  Steve C. has to leave them alone for five seconds, though, so they can leave.  Here they come. 
[02:14:30]  Here they come, fellas.  The lovely ladies.  Privilege.  Privilege.  To make it just a little bit.  Here we go.  This way, ladies.  Don't look at those guys.  The guys in the pool.  Just to make it a little bit harder for the contestants.  Harder?  Harder.  Yeah, more difficult.  Yeah, the contest is more difficult.  Yeah.  So, Rick.  What are they doing out there?  They're slowly starting to peel some garments off.  Oh, good.  All right.  Tell them... 
[02:15:00]  Hey, Rick.  We're pressed for time, so how about they blow off that slow dance move thing they do in  the clubs.  Rip the goddamn clothes off.  They are ripping their goddamn clothes off.  And, Rick, have them do very provocative things right in front of the guys.  That's what they're doing right now.  They were just all over each other.  And now they're...  Now they're...  They had ripper skirt off.  Just rip it.  These guys thought they were coming in for a contest.  Yeah.  Iris Jay just had a turnaround because he couldn't look. 
[02:15:30]  A contest to see who could fill up the balloon the most.  But, in reality, the contest really is...  Who is gay?  Who is gay?  Who is gay?  We will find out shortly.  We changed the rules.  Yeah.  This is the Who is Gay contest.  It's good.  Rick, we only have nine minutes left in the competition.  So, you girls are trying to work their magic.  All right.  Tell the guys it's now or never, man.  Nine minutes left.  Nine minutes, fellas.  Oh, God. 
[02:16:00]  Just haven't showered with his balloon right now.  Just be careful.  They are just...  They are just writhing in front of these guys.  That's good.  Make sure they really put on a good show.  This is a good show.  This is a very good show.  What?  Wow.  I don't know.  It was annoying Paul.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  It was annoying.  It's all hell.  Wow.  That was a nice move.  So, they're gyrating in front of the guys now?  Chica just did a move that I haven't seen ever. 
[02:16:30]  Chica?  Yeah.  The little Spanish one is here again.  And now the other one's crawling through her legs.  That's nice.  All right.  And the guys don't seem to be too much affected.  Are they naked, the ladies?  Yeah.  For all intents and purposes.  Okay.  Good, good, good, good.  Rick, we're down to eight minutes left in the competition.  Eight minutes, fellas.  Eight minutes.  Wow.  Wow.  The split that Chica's just did while leaning up against the wall was incredible. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  Holy.  Do that again.  Do that again.  There you go.  Look at that.  Any of the guys being affected?  I think Charlie's definitely affected.  He's just kind of got this goofy look on his face like, oh, good.  As he's trying to concentrate on keeping his balloon attached.  Right.  Right.  All right.  Wow.  Look at this one.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  The ladies now talking to the guys.  Let's listen to the guys.  I don't like when the strippers talk.  You do? 
[02:17:30]  No, I don't.  Oh, they're about to start kissing.  There they get.  Oh, wow.  Who, the guys in the pool?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, you can only dream.  Wow.  All right.  Well, kneel down.  All right.  Well, don't.  No, I'm not going to describe anything.  We all have imaginations.  Two girls are having fun with each other.  Right.  He's trying to make it tougher for our competitors, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right, Rick, we're just about six minutes left. 
[02:18:00]  Six minutes to go, guys.  Six minutes, six minutes left in the competition.  How's it looking, Rick?  It's kind of tough to tell.  Two of the guys, like I said, still have one guy has his shorts on.  How big is the balloon of the leader?  It's really disturbing looking.  Yeah.  Because you haven't left his studio?  No.  One guy has, like, those big NBA shorts, and his balloon is inside his shorts, let's just say.  It looks like a tremendous camel toe. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, it's just stretching everywhere.  Wow.  Nice move, ladies.  That's a pro.  Oof.  Are the guys liking the ladies there?  The guys are entranced with the ladies.  Guys, you like the ladies?  How much time you got on the clock there, Ope?  About five minutes.  Five minutes, guys.  Five minutes, let it rip.  Mary, how does it smell out there?  Yeah, Mary, grab one of these, Mike. 
[02:19:00]  Is there like a smell?  What's your observation?  Well, I think these boys, they're, I don't know, the smell, they have, they've...  You stupid bitch, sorry.  Oh, my God, Ope?  All this over the latte, huh?  Yes.  You obviously weren't in our little meeting today.  Don't, don't describe, uh, that.  It just doesn't smell out there.  Yes.  Very, very much so.  It's going to smell in here for a good weekend. 
[02:19:30]  I'm not going to...  Well, Rana Fez will have to, uh, deal with that today.  I am, I'm not going out there as well.  We clean up after our pit, so it should be okay.  Wow.  But, I mean, what are we going to do with the baby pools?  Their baby pools filled with, uh, stuff.  Interns.  Oh, yay!  Thanks.  That's what interns are for.  Oh, okay.  Interns and new employees.  You know what the sad part is?  What's in that kiddie pool is next week's latte. 
[02:20:00]  If the interns got to clean it up.  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, there's an action guide.  Hey, what's up?  I can't believe you guys got the, uh, the, you know, big star over there.  I can't believe it.  Oh.  Oh, right overreaction.  Got that bidding working.  No, I think I would go to that bid today.  Uh, Rick, we got four minutes left.  Rick, are you moaning?  Oh, God, did you hear that?  Rick, what the F? 
[02:20:30]  Dude, they were doing a pretzel act before.  But I'm here to go.  Rick, Rick.  Rick, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.  Mama Zika.  Hey, uh, this is what we're going to do, because obviously we're just kind of filling.  Three minutes, guys.  We got three minutes left in the game.  Three minutes until this contest.  Uh, we fixed Brother Joe's brand new Christmas song.  I sure hope so.  And we're going to give it another spin here.  When we come back from this, uh, this, uh, song, the contest will pretty much be over.  We'll be, uh, under a minute in the competition, all right? 
[02:21:00]  Crown a winner.  Check out Brother Joe's new X-mas song.  Hey, man, you want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man.  The police, they got my car.

I don't know if it's really having an effect, the desired effect 
[02:23:30]  But it's definitely taking them  Wow, Irish Jay making a late run  Oh  Hey, Rick, that was a set-up question and you passed  Okay  Congrats  I was so hoping he was saying, well, yeah, three of the guys came  What, what, what?

[02:26:30]  He had a lot  We're talking a lot of fluid in his balloon  Yeah  And it was the guy that I said looks like deformed  Right  Yeah, yeah  And just as he was trying to maneuver it out  It slipped in between his leg and his underwear  And as he tried to squeeze his knees to catch it  Oh, no  It exploded  Oh, what a great end 
[02:27:00]  So now  We have great endings, don't we?  Oh, that's great  It looked like a gallon came out  Oh, no  Did it just go everywhere?  Just all over him and the pool  Thanks  Uh-oh  Whoa  And now we've got a problem because it looks like Charlie might have a leak  Oh, my God  Oh, boy  Either that or he didn't tie off correctly  So  All right  Has everyone tied off?  Everyone is tied off  And one guy has a leak  One guy has a leak  And one guy  It's really between two guys at this point 
[02:27:30]  And one guy who probably would have won the whole thing could not get the blown out of his shorts  And he dropped it  After three hours of doing that, Anthony  Did Steve C. get that on video?  Yeah, I think Steve got it all on video  That'll rock  Okay, listen  Rick, we're going to take a break and we'll find out  We'll come back with the final measurements after this  Yeah, we'll find out who wins the Xbox and we'll talk to the guys, okay?  All right  The best  The funniest thing, though, that door opened up and these naked ladies  Two naked girls come running in 
[02:28:00]  That was great  Why are you guys covering up?  Yeah, they're covering themselves up  Did we scare you or something?  What's the matter?  What's the matter, girls?  I see them covered up  All right  And we'll be back with the results next  All right  And Anthony Shaw  New York  Dallas  Chicago  Philly  Cleveland  Columbus  Sacramento  San Francisco  The Empire is spreading  Cockerach, you bastard!  I saw the video 
[02:28:30]  I believe Justin  That guy looks like he was going to win the whole contest  And he was all shy  Yeah  So he kept the balloon  In  Yeah  In his clothes  In his clothing  And trying to get it out of his clothes  He had a bit of an accident  It exploded  It exploded  It did  It exploded  I saw the video  Went everywhere  And he's out of the competition  On this amazing day  It's wonderful to watch Justin 
[02:29:00]  Trying to maneuver the balloon  Out from where he had it  Looks like a huge  Huge balloon here  He's got plenty of fluid in it  And he could be a win  Wait  He's probably  Oh no  Oh no  Oh get out of the way  Oh no  It's exploding all over the cable  Oh get out of the way  Oh no  This is the worst attempt to be  I've ever seen  Oh  Oh the humanity  Oh my  I can't go on ladies and gentlemen  I can't broadcast 
[02:29:30]  Oh get out of the way  It went all over him  Sucks to be him  It looked to be a gallon  At least  It looked like at least a gallon  It was three hours of work too  You see him in the background of the video  He's fumbling  He's trying to get it out  So he could tie off  So he could tie it off  And he loses it for a minute  It stays in his clothing 
[02:30:00]  But drops down to like his knees  Where he puts his knees together  To try to grab it real quick  You just see a splash  It goes all over him  Then he's all pissed  Well angry  That's what I said  He's pissed  That it happened  And he reaches in  To his clothing  Pulls out just a damp popped balloon  And like disgusted  He throws it into the pool  It was almost like Buckner's  The ball going through Buckner's legs 
[02:30:30]  You know they're just like  We were just like  Okay they're going to tie up  Oh it's through his legs  Oh no  Oh  It was  It went behind the bag  We told you guys yesterday  There was going to be a lot of strategy  Involved in this contest  And then once you have it  It's too late  He grabbed it after it was already empty  All disgusted  And just flung it into the pool  Anthony before Rick gives us the results  Just a few  What did we learn today?  Okay real fast  This is Troy from Jersey  I learned you can buy an Xbox  With cash, credit card  Or liquid gold  He also learned  50,000 skeet vault tickets 
[02:31:00]  Will get you a pinwheel  Sheep lover from Jersey  I learned today  Cindy's radio is broken  She can't shut it off  Wow  Sheep lover  We bow to you today  Very good  I learned today  This is Travis from Westchester  Rick is gay  I've learned this many times  The studio smells like monkey cage  Monkey cage  West Coast Dave  I bet it smells like Norton's apartment in there  West Coast Dave also writes  Strippers or no strippers  I'm starting to feel nauseous  Listening to this  Pete from Jersey 
[02:31:30]  Tell Rick to say  Don't stare at it  Eat it  He sounds like the dude  This is why  They shouldn't pile the  Instant feedbacks on top of the ones  That I already picked out  Jersey Gary from Jersey  What did I learn today  On the Opie and Anthony show  Well the purge is on in D.C.  I can't wait for the Bin Laden  Head on a stick tour  Onay prepping for two shows in one week  Ponderous  F'n ponderous  Strippers sweep away the gayness of the O&A show  Line of the day  Rip your damn clothes off  We were talking about the female strippers 
[02:32:00]  From Privilege Jonas Club  Of course  When we said that  And he also learned  Norton's T-cell count is about the same as O&A's D.C. ratings  You know what Hambone from Jersey learned?  He learned John Fork Shirley  Very good  Al Mack from Clifton  Isaiah learned the slogan for Hudson Valley beer is  It's okay  It's okay  It's okay  Alright Rick  We got the results  We have the results  Final results  Go from  What do we got  Four guys in the  We got five 
[02:32:30]  I also figured we'd bring in the poor and fortunate soul  Can I ask what this guy's doing over here?  He's putting on his shoes  Oh okay  I'm very leery of anything being done in this studio  You're the one that had the mishap  Yeah that was me  You were going to win  Yeah I had it beat  Dude you had it  I had him beat  You had it  But your safety factor of keeping it in your clothing like that seems to have backfired on you  Oh yeah  Thank God I bought clean clothes 
[02:33:00]  What happened now?  Run us through it  I had it tied off  You had it all tied off  You tied it off while it was still in your clothing  Yeah  And then when you were trying to get it out  Why weren't you being very careful  I was  There was just too much in it  No  Something tells me you should have been just a little more careful in how you brought that out  And it slipped  Now what were you thinking the second you lost the grip on it you were like uh oh  Oh S  No 
[02:33:30]  But then you put your knees together to try to grab it again  I was trying anything to salvage it  If he didn't puke in the bottom  If he didn't puke in the pool I might have dropped to my knees  Because it looked to me like when you put your knees together you saved it for a second  Oh yeah just a second but that thing was pushing maximum density  Yeah and then once it blew  It went how far  How much liquid got on you?  Too much  Yeah you were drenched  More than enough  Anything is too much  Well we're not going to forget Justin 
[02:34:00]  No that was very good  I hate to say I think you would have won  Oh I know  I know  So Rick from fourth to first what do we got  And how big was he do you remember how big each balloon  Fourth place is Irish Jay right here  Irish Jay  He was about the size of a let's say a banana  A large banana  Banana  Barely stretched it out  It wasn't shaped like a banana though wasn't it  Barely shaped  What happened  I mean is it still in you because you were drinking a lot 
[02:34:30]  Nah dude  You promised beer yesterday  If there had to be more beer I would have  Ah  The only reason the Irish guy shows up  Did you promise  An Irish guy  No cry baby  Alright  Alright  Well fourth  Fourth  Alright in third place is Paul the annoying guy  Hey right here  Hey how you doing man  How big was it  Pretty size  Yeah about the size of a small grapefruit  A small grapefruit  A small grapefruit Rick without the mic in front of his face  Oh okay  And this 
[02:35:00]  This was pretty close  Because these guys  Dan had tied off very early  Right  And decided to hold the last hour  How'd that work for  And Charlie  Wait he didn't want to untie  He didn't want to untie  He thought  He thought he could  He thought somebody would break  And he would win  Just on the way  Oh okay  Using strategy  Strategy  And then you had Charlie  Who was just there the whole time  He was also the one doing the Al Bundy thing  And how big were their balloons  They were very good size  Like a volleyball you said  Almost  Almost volleyball size  Okay 
[02:35:30]  Second place though  Goes to Dan at three pounds  Dan  Three pounds  Nice  Yeah  Alright Rick  And our winner is Charlie  With four pounds  Charlie  Four pounds  Thank you  Four pounds  Four pounds  Wow  Four pounds of liquid Anthony  Give him that Xbox  He's earned it  Nice  Thank you  He has earned it  Our token black guy  Will now hand you the Xbox  Yes  Don't say anything bad
