<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated debate about Bill Cosby's criticism of the Osbourne family and their reality show.  Opie and Anthony vehemently disagreed with Cosby, using vulgar language to express their disdain, contrasting the Osbournes' perceived authenticity with Cosby's idealized family image from *The Cosby Show*.  This was interwoven with a recurring bit about a listener, Matt, claiming to hear strange sounds added to the show's commercials, causing near-accidents, which the hosts dismissed.

The show then featured a deluge of caller claims of past acting roles, including a self-proclaimed "fat white kid" from *The Cosby Show* (who initially criticized Cosby, then recanted after receiving backlash), "Bruce's brother number two" from *Goodfellas*, a person claiming to be on *Fish*, Buzz from *Home Alone* (defending Macaulay Culkin), a brief call from Christian Slater mentioning a trip to Atlantic City, Angela discussing her father Joe Regano's acting career, and Brendan, who had been in *The Road to Wellville*.  This segment also included the "FU Line," filled with angry and vulgar messages, discussion of the "WOW" contest showcasing women's photos on their website, and a segment dedicated to uncovering listeners with television or film experience.  It ended with a discussion about a child finding adult items in their parents' drawers.

Following this, the show transitioned into a series of prank calls, interspersed with studio banter and more listener calls.  The hosts employed their usual crude and offensive humor, including homophobic slurs and sexually suggestive remarks.  Frenchy, a regular contributor, began the segment with a self-argument.  Calls included purported appearances in *Dice Rules*, a Class B gay porno, and *Pulp Fiction* (later revealed as a hoax).  These calls involved exaggerated claims of fame and were met with the hosts' ribald commentary and insults.  A listener's email detailing the contents of their parents' drawers, including sex toys and explicit materials, prompted laughter and encouragement from the hosts to explore and share more.  A high-speed police chase shown on a studio television was described graphically, along with further discussion of the "WOW" contest and listener complaints. The segment concluded with a prank call to Tom from New Orleans, a fired colleague, using Andrew Dice Clay sound bites, and a listener call about sexual performance issues, discussed with humor and insensitive advice.


The final segment focused heavily on drug use.  Callers described experiences with marijuana, cocaine, and other substances, detailing paranoia, anxiety, and altered perceptions.  One caller recounted a friend's intense reaction to "Fifth Avenue weed" (cocaine-laced marijuana), leading to a belief in the reality of *Independence Day*. Another described marijuana-induced paranoia.  A caller detailed the side effects of Trazodone, including priapism.  The conversation included graphic descriptions of cocaine's effects on sexual function.  Numerous callers shared anecdotes, often highlighting negative psychological consequences, punctuated by the hosts' jokes.  Ron from the Ron and Fez show was a guest in studio. A planned "Stoner Spelling Bee" with Jim Brewer was mentioned, alongside shout-outs to other radio personalities and promotions for upcoming segments and online contest entries.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  People seem to enjoy Total Recalling.  Looking at it on the instant feedback.  People want it back up on Foundry.  It's all in the setup, my friend.  We're smart.  You tell them how awful it is, and then they listen and go,  I mean, it's not too bad. 
[00:00:30]  It's kind of catchy in a weird sort of way.  That's cool.  That's metallic thing out of my nose.  Matt has a problem.  What's wrong, Matt?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Are you guys adding, like, noises to these commercials?  I almost crashed my car.  No.  What are you talking about?  No.  I swear, like, I'm listening to a commercial, like, you know, waiting for you guys to come back,  and all of a sudden I hear, like, a cell phone ringing, and it sounds like it's in the backseat of my car.  So I start turning around to look for the cell phone ringing, and I turn around, and it almost smashes in the car in front of me. 
[00:01:00]  Huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, that noise.  What noise, Matt?  Yeah.  You got to be hearing things.  Uh, and then that other commercial, I heard, like, the AOL, you got mail thing, and I was like, all right, these guys got to be effing with me.  Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about during the commercials, and I go and play a little foosball, a little, uh, a little pinball.  Yeah.  Not even in the studio. 
[00:01:30]  It's all automated.  I mean, we can't eff with the commercials, even if we wanted to.  Oh, no.  No, no, not at all.  All right, Matt.  All right, thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, Anthony Cosby has a problem with the Osborns.  Bye.  This guy is so delusional.  He's so holier than thou, and he's been riding that show that was on.  When was his show on in the 50s? 
[00:02:00]  When was that show on?  He's still riding that like he is actually Dr. Huxtable.  I think he's just jealous.  He's all the success of the Osborns and wishes â€“ he still had that type of success, right?  He still had that type of success.  It's very obvious.  I mean, the fact is, no one wants to watch the Cosmys anymore.  It had its time, but now we're on to the Osbournes.  It's dated, and it doesn't hold up.  And the Osbournes is based in reality.  Sorry it's not some forced utopian ideas about how people should be perceived. 
[00:02:30]  It's real people.  Sorry it's had a doctor and a lawyer and three perfect kids.  Yeah.  And great parents purposefully trying to break stereotypes just for the sake of breaking stereotypes.  I never liked his show.  He's a great comic, although he never touched people like Pryor did, ever.  Does that bug you, that you were around longer than Pryor and you never hit home like he did?  You were never as relevant as he was.  I never found Bill Cosby funny.  His stand-up, I thought, was a long, drawn-out, boring monologue where he'd sit there and talk down to everybody, and I hate it. 
[00:03:00]  It's horrid.  I've got to say, he was a great stand-up.  No, I really have to be honest.  I like him as a stand-up, although as a person I just, this is gross.  We have our own opinions.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't like him.  And how out of touch is he?  Listen to this quote.  He goes,  All of you in the media need to stop with this Ozzy Osbourne.  This Ozzy Osbourne. 
[00:03:30]  He doesn't even know what it is.  That's how he sounds.  Maybe Ozzy should be a better father and then go out and bang some chick out of wedlock and spend $40,000 a year to shut her up.  Maybe that's what Ozzy should do.  That's a good one.  Maybe that's the messed-up Osbourne family.  As a perfect, the Cosby family is obviously a lot better.  You know, where you go and you have a kid and you just, you know, keep it quiet, keep it quiet.  Yeah.  Supposed to be blackbells here for money.  Maybe Kelly should blackmail Ozzy for money and go to jail.  Blackbells what?  I said blackmail. 
[00:04:00]  I said blackmail.  I said blackmail.  Did I say blackmail?  There was a blackmail in there somewhere.  Earl is standing right next to me.  It's just trying to slip down.  I'm sorry, Hustable.  Earl, you can't possibly have something to say.  Earl, what's your opinion on Bill Cosby thinking that the Ozzy Osbourne, as he says here, is a sad...  This is a sad, sad family rule.  Yeah.  I don't think it's sad.  I think it's honest.  Right.  It's totally honest.  You're going against Bill Cosby? 
[00:04:30]  Yes.  On this one?  I disagree with him too, Cosby.  Don't you bet Ozzy didn't have the integrity to hawk pudding pops?  Maybe then Ozzy would be a little bit better for America if he wasn't just being a real family guy and selling pudding pops.  Well, that's what a genius comedian does.  Pryor sold pudding pops for a living, didn't he?  Oh, no way.  He just put out brilliant albums.  And his body.  He tried to put out his body at one point.  The cake.  The kids loved Jell-O pudding pops. 
[00:05:00]  And, you know, Osbourne's child, the daughter, is like my little Rudy, who was...  It wasn't your daughter, Bill.  It just...  That family was fake, Bill.  What an annoyance he is.  And it's just...  His self-righteousness is what bugs me.  It's like, what do you care for?  How jealous are you that you're not being talked about anymore?  You're one of the biggest money makers on television ever.  Shut your face and be happy.  He got so lucky with the Cosby show.  It is perfect time for it, I guess. 
[00:05:30]  It was a good show for the day.  Everything right now.  But you know what?  They're now watching the Osbournes.  What's the problem with that?  It's not sad.  What's sad about seeing a real guy?  Ozzy doesn't abuse his family.  They go to school.  What's the problem?  Why are they sad?  They do have a very open...  Do they use the F word?  Ooh, is that sad because you don't use the F word on stage?  A very open relationship there.  Did Ozzy ever slide his hand down the pants of some young woman that came to Ozzy to learn about acting and whatnot? 
[00:06:00]  Not from my knowledge.  No, why?  I don't think Ozzy has ever been able to do this sexual harassment.  Remember that one?  Let me just put my hand down your pants there.  Oh, this is great.  Feels like a pudding pop.  Oh, I don't think I know.  This is our little secret.  Look, the Cos has the stinky pinky.  The Cos gave it a shocker and I got the stinky pinky.  You know what Ozzy should do maybe to be a little bit more wholesome is put out a really bad show where he stars as some detective. 
[00:06:30]  And then Ozzy can realize that, wow, man, nobody cares about me anymore because even I can't make this awful show work.  Did he do the detective show after Cosby?  Yeah.  What was it called there?  What?  Hold on.  What?  Cosby Mysteries.  Cosby Mysteries.  Was that before or after Leonard Part 6?  Oh, God.  How about that?  How about his movie?  Ghost Dad.  Or the devil in Max Devlin.  Too bad Ozzy can't star in some floppy B films. 
[00:07:00]  Maybe then he'd be a little bit less sad to watch.  The nerve of him just to be relevant for 30 years all over the world.  Well, that's what he sees.  He sees Ozzy being talked about and it's not him being talked about.  So he gets a little upset.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to find some...  An elitist nonsense.  I'm going to build this.  Yeah.  See, now that was a wholesome show about stereotypical little Negro childs playing in a junkyard. 
[00:07:30]  Look, look, Fred, I was playing the radiator.  Look at that.  He played it like an accordion.  Now that's funny.  I'm Dr. William A. Cosby Jr.  Doctor?  You took that honorary degree a little serious sitting there.  Let's see what he's done since The Cosby Show.  If you're not careful, you may learn something. 
[00:08:00]  You may learn something.  All right.  We had The Cosby Show in what?  1984?  Start and then he did Leonard Part 6.  Ghost Dad.  Ozzy has had better movie appearances.  And he does his tribute things.  Miles Davis, Ray Charles tribute.  Was he in Malcolm X?  Uncredited.  Uncredited himself at end of credits. 
[00:08:30]  So the guy kind of fell off the face of the earth there after The Cosby Show.  He became irrelevant.  I still say he was a great comic.  And the reason I make that distinction is because it's his self-righteousness that annoys me.  Like, do you have to...  How bad do you need attention that the success of your show wasn't enough?  Why do you care?  He's played himself in everything since 1996, first of all.  Yeah.  Oh, they were the host of...  Who was the host of the...  What's my line or whatever? 
[00:09:00]  The kids say the darndest thing.  No, no.  There was another awful show.  Like, stop.  Please don't shoot me.  Stop.  What's that happen, man?  What was the other show?  The...  What was the other...  I shut...  No, it's not.  Wow.  He just looked horrified and stopped.  Stop talking.  I don't know.  All right, man.  I'm trying to regroup. 
[00:09:30]  What was that?  No, what was the Groucho Marx show he did?  You bet your life.  He was a Groucho Marx fan.  I think he was tributing, quote, unquote.  But it's amazing how ripping something off and tributing can be considered the same thing.  I have a cigar and everything.  I may restart in the old...  The old...  Jimmy Huxable.  With all...  Well, I'm tributing.  No, you're not Jim.  You're stealing.  And then the last thing he did, Cosby's show, A Look Back.  Yeah.  So, perhaps he's just a little upset that he's not getting the attention that this Ozzy Osbourne... 
[00:10:00]  He had a show on CBS for four years, too.  It was on Monday nights.  Did he?  Yeah, on CBS.  Well, why is that a fan?  What was the name of that show?  That was awful.  I think it was just called Cosby.  Yeah.  He was a poor guy.  No, he was...  He was poor during that show.  Was he?  Yeah.  He was an unemployed guy.  He got out of work.  He was out of work.  The Cosby Mixed Mysteries.  Oh, 96?  It was just called Cosby.  Hilton Lucas is a man who was forced by his employer to retire.  His wife has trouble with him always being at home. 
[00:10:30]  Hey, Earl, why are you wearing the sunglasses?  It's the prescription glasses.  Prescription sunglasses.  Yeah.  All right.  What do you need up indoors?  I was...  I was about to go out.  Where were you going to go?  The whinery.  For what?  What are you getting?  Medicine.  What's wrong with you?  No.  No.  What you got?  No, I just have to get a...  The sickle?  You got the sickle?  Oddly enough, it is from my blood count. 
[00:11:00]  What?  Iron.  Iron supplement.  You got to get iron?  Oh, just eat spinach.  You don't have the sickle cell, do you?  No.  You don't have the sickle cell.  All right.  We just watch around for a while.  Who used to do the sickle cell telethons?  Oh, um...  Used to come out and go,  Ring the bell for sickle cell.  And they'd ring the bell when they wanted to go to the tote board.  Ring the bell for sickle cell.  It wasn't Lou Rawls.  I think it was Lou Rawls.  It might have been Lou Rawls, yeah. 
[00:11:30]  My lady, love.  You'll never find.  You'll never find.  Sickle cells like mine.  Sickle cells that will poke right through the arteries like these do.  Why?  He did.  He raised a lot of money.  Great cause.  Great cause.  All right.  So there you have it.  Well, there's another quote here.  Really?  He goes, I'm telling you, the Osbournes is a sad thing.  It's like laughing at Tiny Tim. 
[00:12:00]  It's the kind of entertainment that you look at but wouldn't want in your home.  And don't like to look at things like that.  Isn't this the same self-righteous guy that got mad at the chick who did nine and a half weeks?  When he got really pissed off at her cause she did something inappropriate and inconsistent with, I guess, the old Cosby tradition.  Look, you know what the point of that quote is?  He referenced Tiny Tim.  Here's how out of touch this guy is.  Can you realize that perhaps he isn't the know-all of entertainment these days? 
[00:12:30]  And the fact that the Osbournes is a very high-rated show?  This song wasn't an MTV.  I never heard of an MTV.  A lot of these old-timers are pissed off that the reality programming has taken off.  I have never seen the Osbournes on the Jack Parr show.  Why is it wrong?  It should be maybe a little bit of a forced mugging and a good-natured family ribbon.  Maybe that's what it is.  But no, nobody wants to see that. 
[00:13:00]  Nobody.  It's entertaining because the networks are just forced to puke down our throats for so long.  People are sick of it.  So now you see something real and it's entertaining because people relate to it.  Sorry, they don't relate to the doctor, lawyer, and three perfect kids nonsense.  Hey, Bill.  This is Bill Cosby.  Oh, what's the matter, Bill?  I would like to talk to you about some of the things that you say in your show.  He's doing Eddie Murphy doing Bill Cosby.  You can't say flim-flam, flim-flam, fart. 
[00:13:30]  Okay?  And I get kind of offended when you talk about the kind of stuff, all right?  Right.  I mean, isn't this supposed to be a family show?  What's your problem with the Osbournes, Bill?  Oh, well, I mean, you got Ozzy who can't even speak English regularly.  But when he gets on the stage and he's all drug-induced, he can sing like a mung-mung.  Like a mung-mung.  Exactly.  I mean, I don't have anything against y'all exactly, but when you start dusting me on, 
[00:14:00]  you know, your radio show, I have a little bit of a problem.  I never saw Theo wear no mohawk.  Going around the house with a bayonet.  See, that's just terrible.  That's just terrible.  Well, hold on.  We got Ozzy calling in here.  Ozzy.  All right, guys.  How are you guys?  All right.  What's the problem, Oz?  Oh, I don't know why you're so angry.  Because I don't go around my house going, you know, Rudy, you know. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know what the problem is.  Now, there's nothing wrong with Rudy.  She's a good little girl.  Oh, I don't know why you're having a problem with my show for you washed up, you know.  I'm coming back from, you know, not selling too many records.  I'm going to hit show, you know.  Why don't you just leave me alone, you know.  Well, for one thing, your daughter is a red-headed slut.  She tried to sing, and she can't do it.  She makes a mockery of herself on, you know, TV, on MTV. 
[00:15:00]  Your daughter's name is Rudy.  Now, that is a good African-American name.  What else do you want me to call my daughter?  Oh, I don't know.  Do you want to hit or something?  Oh, no, guys.  You got me.  I was outside sitting by the pool drinking some, you know, cocktails.  Hey, Junior.  Can't you speak English?  He's speaking English, Coz.  Let him finish.  These guys are going mad, you know. 
[00:15:30]  I was just trying to enjoy my time before AusFest takes off again.  I hear Bill Cotterby, you know, talking about me on radio.  I have no idea what's going on.  I wanted Bill to get a TV show that he could come talk to me.  Well, you know, can you do me one favor, AusFest?  Please.  Morning, Bill.  Can you say helicopter?  Helicopter.  Oh, my God. 
[00:16:00]  That's all I wanted to hear, everybody.  I'll talk to you all later.  All right.  AusFest, I got to tell you, that's a fake Bill Cosby.  Yeah.  We're sorry.  Puts you through that.  All right.  It's not really Bill Cosby.  His impression got consistently worse.  Yeah.  All right.  You started off good and you ended up sounding like the governor, George Wallace.  How did that happen?  Yeah.  I thought he had a little Sipowitz from NYPD Blue.  I'm getting him in there.  All right. 
[00:16:30]  All right, Bill.  Hang on.  We've got to talk to you all right now.  Y'all have a good evening.  All right.  I think I'm going to put something together called CosFest.  We're going to get a little Rudy out there.  And Claire's going to cook for everybody.  And it's going to be nice and much satanic worship.  And everybody gets the pudding pop.  My daughter, Denise Luxable, gets the pudding pop. 
[00:17:00]  It's going to be CosFest.  I call myself Cosby, Bill Cosby, Cosby.  Cosby Cosby.  I'm jealous.  All right, Oz.  All right, guys.  I'm going to take off now.  All right, Oz.  All right, guys.  Bye, Angel.  I know it's a good show when we can make Ozzy laugh. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  What happened to my daughter's son?  Where did she ever go on the show?  She moved away, but she's coming back for the CosFest.  Peter, what's up?  Not much, man.  I was coming home from work and heard about this whole Cosby-Ozzy thing, man.  F. Bill Cosby.  Who are you?  A little white kid.  I bounced on his name.  What?  Across the street. 
[00:18:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You were the white kid from the Cosby show?  The token white kid.  That's me.  Were you the fat little white kid?  That's me.  Always run out of the house.  All right.  Hold on.  What was his name, the character's name?  Peter Chiara.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me get this over here.  And what's your real name?  Peter Costa.  Okay.  And what's your...  My mother's maiden name?  No, why?  Is that on the...  Oh, no, no.  I was...  Internet movie database?  Throwing that one in there. 
[00:18:30]  No, it's not on there.  Okay.  What movies did you do?  The Flamingo Kid.  What else?  Beaches.  And there's some movie on there that I was never in, but it says I was in.  You were in Beaches?  That's right.  You see the back of my dome.  Back of my head.  Where do you live, man?  I live in Haworth, New Jersey.  Oh, you got to come by this place.  Now you got to come in, dude.  I remember seeing you would always, like, run to the front door and run away.  That's right.  Are you still chubby?  Oh, damn right I am.  Do you like Bill Cosby?  Hell no.  Why?  The racist drunk a-hole. 
[00:19:00]  Is he really?  Oh, yeah, man.  He would always just...  He would start drinking, get liquored up, and be like,  get me the white kid.  Get him on my knee.  Are you kidding me?  Are you really him?  Are you really the white kid, huh?  Yes.  Oh, we got to have him in.  All right.  Oh, oh, and just a little.  If Devin's listening, I almost took acting lessons from his mother.  Really?  I'm sorry to hear about his mother.  What happened to his mother?  He was a little ill.  His mom's sick?  The Lemon Sisters.  What happened to his mom? 
[00:19:30]  I don't know.  I think she had some sort of heart complication or something.  Well, we'll ask him about that.  All right.  All right, Peter.  Well, you got to come by and say hi to us one of these days.  Oh, definitely.  I'd love to.  You guys are awesome.  You guys make every day a lot better.  See, we got to do our bit now, Anthony.  I know.  We do this bit from time to time where we find out who's listening to the radio show.  Oh, I listen to you guys all the time.  What was your character's name in the Lemon Sisters?  Oh, damn, man.  I don't remember.  No? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  All I remember is that the wardrobe shoes that they gave me stink like stanky pusa.  I believe they did.  He was a pretty young kid back then, so I don't know.  All right, Peter.  Thanks.  Hey, my pleasure.  Hey, Angel.  Just come by and say you're the fat kid from the Cosby Show.  All right?  All right, man.  All right, cool.  All right, later.  There he goes.  Bye.  We did that bit from time to time.  That's how we met Devin.  Exactly.  Plus, from home alone.  What celebrities are listening?  Yeah, we find out, you know.  Yeah, if any of them are tuned into this program.  And then, you know, they call up. 
[00:20:30]  And that's how we got Devin.  We actually worked our way up to Devin.  Because originally, the only people that were calling were people that said,  I played a dead guy in a recreation on America's Muscle Haunted.  The guy that played a corpse.  And then when Devin called, we were like, oh, my God, it might as well be Pacino.  Right.  All enough, we were just, we were amazed.  We can find out what famous people are listening to us today.  Any others besides the fat kid from the Cosby Show?  Well, we'll have to wait and see. 
[00:21:00]  We'll see.  We usually get a lot of soap opera stars.  Soap stars, yeah.  You get those, or people that were in commercials.  But I watch a lot of television.  And I usually know a lot of the people that have called up,  even with these bit parts or commercials or something like that.  So, yeah.  If you're just hanging out, listening to the show,  and you've done some television or movies or whatever,  we'd love to hear from you.  I'm hoping maybe a talent scout is out there.  Also, Anthony, when we get back,  we've got to talk about fat people on the airplanes. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  We've got the WOW contest going on.  One of the girls from Dallas,  we had to take her pictures off because she never gave ID.  Never gave ID.  And they replaced her with another girl from Dallas.  So there's a little controversy brewing in Dallas,  as far as the WOW thing goes.  I was on fish with Abe Vigoda.  Who?  Johnny?  Johnny.  Hey, boys.  Yeah.  This is Johnny Casisi.  I was on fish with Abe Vigoda.  I was in Bugsy Malone with Scott Bale.  I know. 
[00:22:00]  Dude, I know exactly who you are if it's you.  It's me, bro.  I was a huge fan of fish.  And that is really you.  I swear on my kids.  I live in your old neighborhood.  I live in East North Fork.  I think you're right.  I hope so.  I've been banging the wrong woman all these years.  No, I remember because years ago, many, many years ago,  I think when Fish was still on TV and you were underage,  you went to a disco out there on Long Island that my mother used to work at. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah, boy.  Called Chaz in Huntington.  Yeah.  I remember Chaz.  Yeah, remember Chaz in Huntington?  Yeah, I'm an old fart now, man.  40 years old.  What did he do on Fish?  He was like the smart-ass kid.  He was funny.  That's really you, huh?  I swear on my children.  Well, why don't you get your ass in here one day?  Boy, I would love nothing more.  All right, hold on.  We'll get some numbers from you and stuff and give you our numbers  and whenever you get a chance. 
[00:23:00]  You'll know this kid the second you see him.  You'll know him the second you see him.  Can I make one small comment?  Uh-oh.  Go ahead, Johnny.  Yeah.  I can't tell if the contestant from Philadelphia is a pretty monster or an ugly woman.  Oh, my dad.  Martin, you're the man from...  Thanks, man.  All right, Johnny, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, man.  All right, 10-4.  What years was Fish on?  Does anybody remember the show?  Fish was on in what?  Late 70s?  Late 70s.  It was the spin-off of Barney Miller.  Yeah, sure, sure.  Because Fish was on there.  And it turned out Fish and his wife had some home with children in it, 
[00:23:30]  various troubled children they were taken care of.  And he was one of them.  And he was like the little chubby Italian kid that was just a big smart-ass.  How many years did it run?  Was it like one or two years?  Was it five years?  It didn't run that long, but it wasn't like an on-and-off kind of thing.  I used to watch it.  Yeah, I remember.  When I was a kid.  All right.  It was pretty funny.  Here's the big question.  Does he beat out the chubby white kid from the Cosby Show?  Yes, absolutely.  Definitely.  So Johnny's in the lead?  Yeah.  He was in... 
[00:24:00]  I'm trying to look for other stuff he was in.  All right, we'll look and we'll take a break.  Oh, good.  Okay.  And we'll figure it out next.  Let's go to the FU line in the meantime.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  See, I always said the f*** you to be stinky European f*** to come to my tattoo pile  and bragging about how you walked from your Upper West Side fancy hotel room all the way downtown.  You expect me to tattoo some f*** you up beyond then, too much to blow your stinky pit.  What green silk in the world can you take that f***ing smile off of you?  You used to get a billion dollar silk you paid $300 a night for on the Upper West Side.

You want to shoot.  I just got to play away the makeup.  You want to shoot.  Why do you need to keep them on the table?  You want to shoot.  I don't think you suck.  I don't make you.  I don't make me feel.  That's right.  This is the Opie and Anthony Dope. 
[00:26:00]  A couple of phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York, here's the number for you.  866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  We've got lots on the table today, don't we, Anthony?  Yes, we do.  Talking about people with miserable marriages.  Ah, we're looking for famous people to call us today.  Like famous people that listen to our show.  Yeah, if you're just sitting around listening and you've been on a, I don't know, a TV show a long time ago. 
[00:26:30]  Or a movie, show poppers even.  Whatever.  You did a commercial that we all know.  Right.  You say, oh, remember me?  I'm the guy that.  That's all.  We do this from time to time and we get to talk to some interesting people.  Yes.  Now, Pete Costa is calling back.  Pete.  Yes.  What's up?  Um, I was just informed that, uh, what I said might have been a little slanderous. 
[00:27:00]  And, uh, he wasn't a racist or a drunkard.  And, uh, he was a very nice man.  Ha, ha, ha.  No, but he really was, man.  You know, he, uh, he gave me the start to my, uh, career.  Oh, my God!  Who called you during the commercial?  Who called you, man?  That's a good backpedal, though.  You are backpedaling.  Who called you?  Who called you?  What?  Who called you up and said, dude?  Oh, he, I got flooded with calls.  Oh, my God!  What'd you say?  Why?  You're only expressing an opinion, dude.  Who cares? 
[00:27:30]  Ah, you're a little kid.  What are you doing?  I was, I was five years old.  Right.  I didn't know.  You don't know?  I didn't know.  Why is it okay for Cosby to talk about Ozzy any way he wants, but you can't talk about him?  That's not right.  I, I know.  It's, it's, you know what, man?  It's, it's money.  Pete, someone got to you.  Someone got to me.  What, is one of his agents listening?  Wait, I want to hear Pete kiss some more ass.  Go ahead, Pete.  Did you slam the phone down and run out the front door like you did when you heard it kiss?  I hid in the hamper.  Go ahead, Pete.  Hid in the hamper.  Get yourself out of this.  Kiss some more ass.  I'll kiss it all I have to. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Who cares if he's making you all this money?  All right, Pete.  All right, man.  All right, I just wanted to clear that up.  Yeah, very clear.  You know, I didn't want to dig any more holes.  Right.  You know, stepping in more toes.  All right, cool.  All right, guys.  Right.  Someone got to him.  He puts him on his show and he calls him a drunken racist.  What's your attitude?  And he calls that the commercial.  He's a great guy and he gave me my start.  I mean, I'm going to give him a cosby.  What did the black monster call him or something?  That is classic.  I just want to clarify something. 
[00:28:30]  He wasn't drunk and he's not racist.  And he's a great guy.  He gave me my start.  And there's certain things I said made me slanderous.  And, um, it seems like there's a big wig out there listening to us today.  God, that's funny.  I wonder who called him.  It's probably one of his family members.  Dude, he could sue you for that.  Okay, he called that.  That is so goddamn funny.  Spencer, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I was in the film Goodfellas in 1988.  Now, Goodfellas.  Yes, I played Bruce's brother. 
[00:29:00]  Bruce got the F beat out of him in the driveway of his own home in front of his Corvette.  Yes.  Because he made a hit on, he hit on Lorraine Bracco.  You don't see it, but you hear about it.  She goes crying to him that, she goes crying to Ray Liotta that her neighbor tried to hit on her.  And Ray Liotta goes across the street with the butt end of his gun.  And I'm standing right to his left looking horrified.  But was Goodfellas in 88?  It was in 89, I believe.  It came out in 90.  So what were you, like an extra?  No, I was a day player. 
[00:29:30]  Did you have a line in the movie?  Yes, I did.  And I'm in the credits as well.  I'm still on the payroll.  I still get residual checks from Warner Brothers.  How much did I send you, dude?  Because I want to know how much money was coming from me.  How much did you get?  You get about $500 for the day.  And then when the film comes out, you get another $500.  And then, you know, here it is 14 years later.  I got a check recently for $12.  You are Bruce's brother?  Bruce's brother number two.  Pardon me.  Bruce's brother number two.  Yes.  What was your line of Goodfellas?  I said, in a horrified fashion, stop.  What are you doing? 
[00:30:00]  You're going to kill him.  Thank you.  All right, dude.  Here's a question for you.  Hold on.  I want to say it.  You've got to say it how you said it.  Well, I was such a, I was so bad in the film.  I looked like such a tool.  I was going, oh, man.  Stop.  What?  You're going to kill him.  Horrible.  Horrible.  But I was in the film, and I looked just like I did then.  And we shot it in upstate New York, in New Rochelle.  What was your name in the film?  Bruce's brother number two.  I'm sorry.  What's your real name?  I'm sorry.  I'm just teasing you.  In the film, my name's Spencer. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, we've got the Goodfellas DVD.  Hold on.  I'm in like an hour into the film.  Yeah, pop it in.  You know exactly how.  It's an hour into the film exactly?  Something like that.  You don't mind your last name being used?  No.  I'm Spencer Bradley.  No big deal.  That's what I'm saying over here.  I'm sorry, guys.  That's all you've ever done?  No.  I did some work with Comedy Central.  They did this horrible make fun of MTV kind of thing called MTV Give Me Back My Life,  where they poked fun at all the top ten videos.  And I was one of the new kids on the block that got beat down by a group of prepubescent girls. 
[00:31:00]  Norton would have loved it.  All right.  Well, you know something?  The part that you got isn't very big.  No, it's not.  But I got to say, the movie, gigantic.  Huge.  Huge, right?  You're sitting pretty good.  It's good on the resume.  It's kind of like having a line in Spider-Man.  Yes.  Like Norton.  A line in Spider-Man.  Similar type of scene.  Hold on.  You got a fan out there. 
[00:31:30]  I got to go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  What's up, man?  Dude, if you're that dude, you did a great job.  Because I remember.  I remember.  You guys were the biggest pussies for not helping you.  Hey, the other guy's a bigger pussy.  Bruce's brother number one goes,  Don't shoot.  Yeah, dude, that was great.  You guys looked so scared-assless.  That was like, I remember it clear as day.  It was beautiful.  I mean, you did a great job.  That's you.  You did a great job.  It was so tough.  Martin Scorsese came up to me and he goes,  Listen, you're going to have to say something.  And I go, Well, Mr. Scorsese.  He goes, Listen, listen.  I'd appreciate it if you called me Marty.  And I go, Yes, Mr. Scorsese. 
[00:32:00]  He shakes his head.  And Ray Liotta's doing a scene, right?  And he's doing a rehearsal.  So I check out my line.  I go, Stop.  What are you doing?  You're going to kill him.  That was real as hell.  Most people act like that.  Ray Liotta stops beating him and he looks up at me and he goes,  Shut up.  Shut up.  It was awesome.  Hey, Will wants to know if Spencer's the guy that Liotta pointed the gun at.  No, he points the gun at the brother on the right.  I'm on the left.  He's on the left.  He's on the coast. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  We both had lines.  Hey, dude, you had a moment with Martin Scorsese.  That's great.  How cool is that?  Phenomenal.  How cool is that?  Marty.  There's a guy out there that remembers this guy.  He's kind of a fan.  Oh, yeah.  Did you get it up there?  Yeah.  You got it?  Hold on.  Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Dude, what color shirt are you wearing in the scene?  I believe I'm wearing a blue shirt and I have a coif.  Yeah, I was going to say, nice hair.  Oh, I completely remember.  And I'm wearing a pair of Adidas shell tops.  I believe him completely, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Totally.  You see me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It took me two seconds to find the scene.  I knew exactly where it was.  And I'm such an idiot.  I got my hand over my mouth.  It's the worst scene ever.  And I did a scene in a film called Blue Steel with Jamie Lee Curtis and Ron Silver.  And I came down the stairs.  I was an extra.  I played a concerned neighbor.  And I played the same character, basically.  You're so one-dimensional.  Dude, are you still acting?  No.  I stopped.  This was a long time ago.  But three years ago, I tried to get back into it.  I did a radio commercial with Bob Euchre. 
[00:33:30]  And that was it.  What happened?  Why did you stop, man?  Because there was an actor's strike, and a lot of agents got fired, and the business  just sucked.  It really did.  You know, you've got to be a waiter.  I don't want to be an effing waiter.  I want to have a real job.  What do you do now?  Do you know what orthotics are for your feet?  What?  Orthotics.  Custom-made insoles.  Opie should know what they are because he skis.  Custom-made insoles.  For your feet.  Yeah.  I make them.  How did you go from a Scorsese film to that?  He was saying, hey, call me Marty. 
[00:34:00]  Marty Scorsese is going, call me Marty, and now you're in feet.  I'm in feet.  I'm right by you guys, actually.  I'm on 53rd and Madison.  All right.  Dude, how did you feel when that movie first came out?  Did you feel like, oh, man, I'm on my way?  Yeah, I did.  Now look at me.  No, I'm not.  Your feet are a little smelly, madam.  Man, Spencer, if you were a little more famous, we'd invite you down to the station for a beer.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on, the guy was in Goodfellas.  I'm kidding.  Dude, I watch movies sometimes and I see somebody in the scene. 
[00:34:30]  I think when that person landed that part, they thought, all right, man, this is it.  I'm on my way.  Oh, man, it was awesome.  I got invited by Barbara DeFina and Martin Scorsese.  An invite came to my home.  I went to the premiere on the east side.  It was a red carpet.  I went with my girlfriend.  It was awesome.  Hey, you're doing a chick just going, hey, I'm in this movie, man.  And is she still dating you?  Are you married?  No, I'm single.  Are you?  Are you interested?  I'm not interested.  I'm lying out of respect.  Martin.  My friend, I'll give you a handy with the hand that shook Martin Scorsese's hand. 
[00:35:00]  Oh.  You know, Jim would take you up on that knowing him.  Handy.  Actually, Jim, I know someone that met you.  My friend's a comic named Jason Anders.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know Jason.  I don't know him well.  I don't know him well, but I do know him very well.  He has a lot of nice things to say about you.  Oh, yeah.  He's hung nicely.  All right, Spencer, hold on for a second, okay?  Yeah, man.  All right.  There goes Spencer, who's in Goodfellas.  He's in Goodfellas.  That's pretty good.  Another line in Goodfellas.  Oh, okay.  Bob Gollum is a comedian who's in Goodfellas.  He had, like, one line.  He walks in.  He goes, you know, two niggers stole my truck. 
[00:35:30]  Where's your phone?  And he starts walking towards the phone.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's in a comic, Bob Gollum.  And a friend of yours?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He lives in L.A.  Devin.  Gentlemen.  What's up, Devin?  Hey, guys.  What's going on there?  What were you in?  Yeah, yeah.  I was in the Opie and Anthony celebrity softball game.  But you didn't play?  Yeah, I was the guy who was sitting on the bench the whole damn game.  I thought that was Norton.  Norton got up.  Norton, you went up.  It's Buzz from Home Alone. 
[00:36:00]  What's up, Buzz?  Yes.  How you guys doing?  Well, we've thrown that fishing line out again.  Yeah, and somebody took acting lessons with my mother.  That's what the little fat kid from the Cosby Show said.  Really?  He almost did.  Remember the little...  Oh, he said he almost did?  Remember the little white kid?  The little fat kid from the Cosby Show who used to run out of the house all the time?  So let me get this straight.  He didn't take classes with my mom, but he's now saying in front of 18 cities that she has a heart condition?  I believe that is what he said before we... 
[00:36:30]  And he said Bill Cosby, all those nasty things about Bill.  Well, he backpedaled on that one.  He called back and backpedaled the hell out of that one.  I'm going to have to call him up on that.  You know, actually, Macaulay Culkin is actually a racist drunkard.  I want to set this back straight for that.  It was not Bill Cosby.  It was not Bill Cosby.  And you won't be calling to a backpedal on this one?  Well, Macaulay...  He's a great guy.  I love him.  He's a great guy.  He should be a racist after Michael was dipping for all those years. 
[00:37:00]  Those are completely slanderous lies.  Michael Jackson never laid a hand on him or any other child.  No, you were just joking.  Not a hand, no.  Maybe a helmet on the cheek.  Yeah, he just...  Yeah, I wasn't really his type.  I was...  He didn't really like the large stock toys.  He likes his smelt.  He doesn't like the Steve from Foundry build.  He prefers a garret.  All right, Devin.  We'll come here to see us soon, right?  Yeah.  I certainly will.  Hey, are we still directing that thing?  What's that?  I forgot.  I'll ask him next to you.  Yes, yes, indeed.  Yes.  I'm still directing the film. 
[00:37:30]  I'd still like you to be in it.  All right.  I didn't say that.  You idiot.  You can't say that.  I called him Sweet Tease.  I know.  There goes Buzz from Home Alone.  Hello?  Who's this?  Hello?  What's up?  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie.  Hello.  It's Christian Slater.  Hey, it's Christian Slater, everybody.  I had to hold on the goddamn phone for 20 minutes to talk to you guys. 
[00:38:00]  It's Christian Slater calling in on our show.  What do I got to do to get on quicker next time, for Christ's sake?  What are you doing just driving around, Christian, to listening to you?  Well, I'm heading down to the A.C.  Going to spend a little money.  Hopefully get laid.  You know, stuff like that.  But, hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow?  Are you going to stop by?  Well, Christian Slater, if you want to stop by this show, Christian Slater, you have an open door. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, Christian, you're on your way to Atlantic City.  Are you going to be there July 27th when I do the Trump Arena?  I'm, uh, hey, Norton, when are you coming out my way?  Where's your way?  What's your way?  I'm, uh, in L.A. right now.  But, um, I'm just coming, I'm going to spend you out until probably Saturday.  He's in L.A. in his car.  We're, we're, we're not, we're not broadcasting L.A.  No, no, he lives in L.A.  He's driving to Atlantic City right now.  I mean, no, I'm Jersey right now.  Oh, okay.  I'm heading down to A.C.  Ah.  Hey, Christian, let's just get real quick.  What was your first film?  My first film? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Well, uh, right now, I am in another, what?  What an asshole.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  He goes, hello.  Angela, what's going on?  That's so funny.  Hi.  Hi.  My father's in all these movies.  Your father?  He's actually trying to call in and he keeps getting a busy signal.  Oh, no.  Well, we have a lot of very famous people calling in right now.  He was in Casino, he was in Analyze This, Mickey Blue Eyes.  Who was your dad?  His name is Joe Regano. 
[00:39:30]  Why do you play in some of these movies?  Analyze This, he was like in the first scene.  He was sitting with De Niro at the table and then he walks outside and gets shot.  Who was he in a...  In Casino, he had a couple of speaking parts, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He was filming in Vegas with them for six weeks.  That's so cool.  His name is Joe.  He's trying to get through and he just called me.  He has a really raspy voice.  All right.  We'll know him when he calls that.  And in Mickey Blue Eyes, he was the one that was mumbling all the time. 
[00:40:00]  I don't know if you saw it.  I couldn't stand that movie.  His real name is Joe...  Regano.  Regano.  He was Vincent Borelli.  Yes.  Vincent Borelli in Casino.  He has like the guinea t-shirt underneath the maroon shirt.  You can see through it.  Well, we'll have to look.  He was also on all those ESPN commercials with this guy named Vinny Vela.  That's not ringing a bell.  Yeah, I know.  If I see him, I'll probably know.  He did the baseball commercials.  They did it for a long time. 
[00:40:30]  He talks with a really deep, raspy voice.  He's in The Crew, 12...  The Crew, right.  ...by-time, potluck.  I don't know.  Well, you know, Casino, very big movie.  Yeah, he was...  Well, he knows Bobby De Niro very well.  Bobby De Niro.  They call him Bobby.  Well, when he called us to Vegas, he told us he was hanging out with Bobby and Marty,  and we didn't know who he was talking about.  Bobby.  Bobby and Marty, how great he is.  Well, thank you, Angela.  Well, I'm going to look for what he looks like then. 
[00:41:00]  Okay.  And he'll get through.  Thanks, Angela.  Okay.  Bye.  So, who's the most famous person so far, Anthony?  I want to go with the Goodfellas guy.  I got the Goodfellas guy, but we got a guy that was on the road to Wellville.  He was in that.  Turner and Hooch.  No, no.  The guy said he was Hooch in Turner and Hooch.  Oh, I thought he was in Turner and Hooch.  Because I was Hooch in Turner and Hooch.  What a dick.  What a dick.  Brendan.  Yes, sir.  Hey, Brendan.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Yeah, I'm not even in the credits, but it was one of the stupidest movies I think ever made. 
[00:41:30]  Did you guys see it?  No one saw The Road to Wellville.  It was in the freaking theater for three weeks.  Yeah.  That's it.  You were in that one.  Yeah, I was Burley attendant number two.  Burley?  And, Norton, you were Surly.  Yes.  Hey, you know.  So, I chased Dana Carvey around with two other guys in his underwear.  Burley attendant number two.  Yeah, you're not even in the...  No, but it was kind of funny.  And I got to meet Anthony Hopkins because he was in it, too.  Oh, that's okay.  That's a plus. 
[00:42:00]  So, I shook his hand.  Hopkins is in a new hit movie with Chris Rock.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I think I'll miss that one.  Hit movie?  Did we have to put the S in front of hit?  All right, guys.  I don't think you even care, but I just wanted to call in.  Yeah, you're not really beating the other people that are called so far.  I know.  If you starred in Wellville, that wouldn't be impressive.  Yes.  All right, thanks, boys.  You guys suck.  Thanks, man.  Who's in the lead, Anthony?  The kid from Fish?  Well, no. 
[00:42:30]  I think Spencer, he had a speaking line in Goodfellas.  But, yeah, the kid from Fish, you'd probably know him if you saw him.  This guy, you wouldn't know just on the street.  Spencer.  Yo.  We're waiting for them to come in with your movie line, but I don't think it's going to happen.  Hmm.  You mean as far as playing it and listening to it?  Yeah, we want to put it on the air today.  Oh, okay.  Well, whatever.  All right.  So, what's up?  Do we have that clip?  Do I lose?  Well, they're still trying to get it.  I'll put Spencer back on hold, Anthony.  All right.  We're going to break here. 
[00:43:00]  Spencer's angel.  Hey, yesterday we were doing that going to Mommy and Daddy's drawers.  Yeah.  And the kids were finding some fun stuff, Anthony.  They really were.  They were condoms and vibrating things.  And the funniest one yesterday, I think, was the kid that went into his mom's closet and said,  she has a French maid outfit hanging up in here.  I said, now why do you think your mom has a French maid outfit?  And he goes, I don't know.  She's a maid on the side?  She's a maid on the side. 
[00:43:30]  Better than that, though, is the paper towel kid.  Oh, yeah.  Paper towel kid.  He found a dill.  He found a dill.  The little kids were calling them dills yesterday.  He found a dill.  I found a dill?  And he goes, well, I'm holding it with the paper towel, so I can't really turn it on.  I go, why are you holding it with the towel?  He goes, this goes where?  Yeah, I heard that.  Hello?  Yeah, that's what he goes.  He goes, this goes where?  Hello?  Well, I got an email from a 16-year-old girl.  She was trying to call like crazy yesterday.  Yeah.  She wrote a long email about some of the things she found. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  Next to her parents' bed.  Fascinating.  I mean, it looks like her parents F like freaking monkeys.  Really?  She lists like 10 things she found, so we'll read her email next.  Raunchy audio.  Look like a dog for me.  Spankable video.  I got my thing in my hand here.  All the best parts of the Opie and Anthony show end up on foundrymusic.com.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:44:30]  That was right, W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Lots going on today, Anthony.  We're trying to find the most famous person listening to us right now.  Today.  Yeah.  And so far, I think it's Spencer, the neighbor guy from Goodfellas.  Well, we had Spencer.  Yeah, he was the guy that, he was one of the brothers of the guy that got the crap beat out of him in the driveway.  By Ray Liotta.  The guy that was hassling Ray Liotta's shit. 
[00:45:00]  We'll see if we can do a little better than that today.  Yeah.  All right, David Buzz from Home Alone is calling back.  You want to clarify something.  Yes, David.  Hello, gentlemen.  Yeah, yeah.  Hi.  I just want to say I was a little out of line when I said Macaulay Culkin was a racist and a drunkard.  And I'd like to retract that.  I just want to apologize.  He's a very nice individual.  And he's never had a drink.  And he loves black people.  Did someone get to you? 
[00:45:30]  What?  Why?  No.  Of course not, Mr. Acumia.  No.  Of course not.  No?  No one got to you?  No.  No one's standing here right now.  It seems like you might be worried about slander or something.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Not at all.  All right.  No, I just want to let you know he's a very...  No.  Not at all.

[00:49:00]  I think he got himself.  There you go, Frenchy arguing with himself.  Holy crap, is that funny.  Hey, Club Soda Kenny.  I'm a famous person.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  I'm famous.  Yes, he is.  You are famous in that you just kiss ass on the legend.  That's right.  What's wrong with that?  I love you guys, too.  That's right.  Kenny, you were in Dice Rules.  Kenny was in Dice Rules.  Oh, he was? 
[00:49:30]  Thank you.  I was in a few movies, but let's not talk about me.  How are you guys?  You're doing all right, Kenny.  Hey, listen.  And Frenchy, do not imitate the legend.  Only Anthony has permission to imitate the legend.  Thank you, Kenny.  Because he has talent.  That's why the show is so great.  Opie has the looks, Anthony has the talent, and Norton has the sexuality.  And Norton has all the diseases.  Yeah, but keep that a secret. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  All right, Kenny.  The chicks can't know that.  All right, Kenny.  Do I win the famous person contest?  No, you're not too famous.  That's why.  Oh, come on.  Sorry, Kenny.  Come on.  We'll put you in the mix, though.  All right, thank you.  You're famous, though.  I'll say.  I'll say.  Vegas, 4th of July weekend.  What's that?  Vegas, 4th of July weekend.  All right, Dice.  What's going there?  Cool.  Yeah.  Thank you, Kenny.  Will the legend be smiling a lot? 
[00:50:30]  Smiling?  I'll be singing to him.  You are so beautiful to me.  Can't you see?  What does his smile remind you of, Kenny?  His smile reminds me of a sunset.  Because he lights up my life.  He gives me hope.  To carry on.  To carry on. 
[00:51:00]  How superstar Jim Norton doing?  You're such a kiss-ass.  You really do kiss Dice's ass.  A little too much.  Yeah, I was kissing your ass pretty good at the softball game.  And you should have.  That's why I did it.  That's what I do.  That's what I do.  And don't be stupid.  You moron.  Cut soup.  That's what I say.  Cut soup.  And don't be stupid.  All right.  What is this?  A three-way call with him?  He's telling you.  Hey, how are you doing?  And don't be stupid.  Hey, how are you doing? 
[00:51:30]  Uh, hold on.  Uh.  Yeah, hold on.  Today was yesterday because yesterday was so close, like almost like it was the same day.  He is so smart and prolific.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  I'm used to him yelling at me.  You don't want the meal starting up over here because everybody's like, you're the one asking me to say, remember back then?  Yeah.  He's like a prophet.  He like says prophecy. 
[00:52:00]  Hang the phone up, you skank.  All right.  If you want me to hang up, say goodbye.  Wow.  All right.  Goodbye.  All right.  Take care.  I love you.  All right.  Bye, Kenny.  Hope so, Kenny.  Goodbye.  All right.  There it goes.  I'll say.  I'll say.  Hey.  I'll say.  Another Kenny on the line.  Yes, Kenny.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up, baby breast?  How are you?  Hi.  Listen, I was in a, um, I was in a class B gay porno and it was sleepover at the ranch.  I played gay rich and I had a speaking part and it was, would you like a, uh, uh, Anthony? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Hey, would you like some hot sires?  Can I tickle your brown baby?  I was asleep.  No, you weren't.  You had a cameo, Gary. 
[00:53:00]  Don't you remember?  Yeah.  I'm pretty famous, aren't I?  Very good.  All right, thank you.  Jimmy, I have a question real quick.  How do I get tickets for down in Trump Marina?  I'm dying to go.  Ticketmaster will have them.  They can watch out tomorrow morning at 10.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, guys.  Love you.  All right, Kenny.  All right, sweet breath.  Bye-bye.  Everyone's picking on that one.  What?  Barry, what's going on?  Sweetie.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  In 1982, I was in an after-school special with Joe Namath and the girl who played Annie on 
[00:53:30]  Broadway in the first run.  It's called An Orchestra of the Team 2.  I got screen time, man.  Wow.  Really?  And get this.  Broadway Joe is a dick.  He is?  Why?  He didn't treat you good?  He's hanging up.  I think he's lying.  He's just being silly.  Joe finally called in, the guy from the casino.  Hey, turn that radio down.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Joe.  It's called An Orchestra.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, really?  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Turn that radio down.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Talk to me.  Talk to me.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Nothing right now, kid.  Everything's out.  You're the guy from Casino, but you have the horrible phone working.  Now, that's his voice.  No, I know, but the phone...  I know this guy by his voice.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's been in a lot of films, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm trying to think of where I've heard him. 
[00:54:30]  I know I've heard that voice before.  Yeah, it's Joe.  Yes.  Hello.  Do you have, like, a catchphrase or something, maybe?  We can pick something up off of that.  Are you speaking to me?  Can I talk to Joe Dildo?  Joe Dildo.  Joe, get a better phone calls back.  Yeah, you can't hear us.  Wow. 
[00:55:00]  Right now, the daughter's like, ah.  All right, we're going to humor this guy, and then we're going to move on.  Steven, what's up?  I wouldn't call myself famous, but I've been in Austin Powers,  and I've been in Pulp Fiction.  Non-speaking role, played the role of the gimp.  See, now this is very hard to believe.  You understand that we might.  I've got no reason to call in Julia Sweeney off of Saturday Night Live.  Uh-huh.  She's my ex-wife.  Really?  I don't know how you'd confirm this or deny it, but... 
[00:55:30]  Where are you calling us from?  Calling you from Spokane, Washington.  Washington?  Yeah.  And you listen to the show?  I was told to give you a call for random famous people,  but I am familiar with Opie and Anthony.  And you were married to...  Julia Sweeney.  She played as Pat.  Yeah.  Do you got a credit on that?  Not to its Pat.  To Pulp Fiction, I do.  Yeah.  I was in Austin Powers.  I was the inept guard that got shoved into the lava pit. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's also the gimp?  Yeah.  Well, it's myself.  My real job is a writer for Tiny Toons.  Tiny Toons.  Yeah, the cartoon.  Because I'm looking.  I see Random Play is on your credit as a writer.  Yeah.  And so is its Pat as a writer.  She was my wife.  I did very little writing.  I take no credit for that.  And Boy Meets World?  Yeah.  Dude, didn't that make like 60 grand at the box office, its Pat? 
[00:56:30]  Well, I got all my friends and relatives to go buy a ticket.  Come on.  We're not proud.  Jim, I'm very impressed with your filmography so far.  I mean, Spider-Man has done many hundreds of millions of dollars.  Not all of us are fine actors like you are.  I'm not even ripping into it.  Maybe it didn't get press or whatever.  I'm not even ripping it.  Okay.  I never saw it.  I've been in an episode of New Heart.  I've never pursued it as a craft.  I fell into the role of the gimp.  Now, how did you get that role? 
[00:57:00]  Bruce Willis is somewhat a friend of mine.  Really?  And when the movie started, it was a small budget movie.  It was nothing to film.  It was an afternoon's work for that character.  The movie itself was not that highly promoted.  It ended up being a huge cult hit, though.  And you were the gimp.  Yeah.  Didn't say a word.  Now, why were you in that drawer?  I don't know.  What was in the briefcase?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, you know something? 
[00:57:30]  I'm buying it.  I might be naive, but I'm kind of believing it.  All right.  Well, I have to ask you one question.  This will at least very help confirm.  Where was that scene shot as well as most of the film?  I can't hear you say that again.  Let's see if he knows.  Where was that scene shot as well as most of the film?  Jim?  Yes.  Yeah.  See?  It wasn't him.  You're very good, Jim.  That's a good answer.  Good question.  Yeah.  I don't even care if he got me.  I knew it wasn't him.  Yeah.  How did you know?  It was just too obscure, and the gimp is too well-known a character, and he slipped 
[00:58:00]  up because he knew that I was Jim, and he said somebody called in and told him to call  in, and then the second letter was like, and Jim, I'm impressed with you having been  in this and that, and he's saying he's called from Spokane, Washington, and someone called  him to call in.  He's like, look at you.  You are Columbo.  Yeah.  That's good.  Very nice.  I let my guard down.  I feel like an idiot for doing that.  I let my guard down for a minute.  You little angel, you're just asking.  You know what?  Jesus, you give yourself a...  Wait, don't you dare be hiding yourself.  I beat myself up a little.  We wanted to believe, Jim.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  We wanted to believe.  No, no.  You don't need to believe.  We were there, too.  You don't need to believe because there's enough celebrities that enjoy this show where  you don't need phony balonies calling in, and forgive me for being so harsh.  All right, Tiffany.  I'm usually more skeptical.  I know.  That's all right.  You wanted to believe, you little special thing.  Tiffany.  Who has the biggest thing in the world?  What's up, Tiffany?  Hi.  Who are you?  I'm well contested at number one from Sacramento.  Oh.  Let me take a look.  Oh.  You're the girl...  Oh.  You're the...  I hear you guys talking about me, so I just want to call in and say hi, and I have a 
[00:59:00]  complaint as well.  You were the girl just before the Sacramento hot streak ended.  Exactly.  I kept it going as long as, you know, we could keep it going, apparently.  You are beautiful.  Thank you.  The first contestant in the WOW Contest.  Thank you, yes.  Yeah, I just went well about that.  Pictures are up on opianthony.com.  Huh?  I'm sorry?  Go ahead.  I can barely hear you guys, so...  Yeah, what is going on?  Everyone can't hear us all of a sudden.  What's your complaint, Angel Eyes?  My complaint is the guys around here with the WOW stickers on their rigs.  They don't pay attention. 
[00:59:30]  Really?  We hear this complaint from the ladies all the time.  If you have a WOW sticker, you might want to look around a little bit.  Yeah, hey, do we have like a WOW honk or something that we could, you know...  No, you just said there's enough guys out there that you can WOW.  Yeah.  Thanks, because, you know, I've been WOWing, but they're just not looking.  And you've got a lovely set, too.  We can see it on opianthony.com.  Yeah, thank you.  I'm pretty...  I like them.  All right.  Well, good luck in the contest.  Thank you very much.  You guys have a great day.  All right.  There goes Tiffany from Sacramento.  She's beautiful.  Is she?  That's a couple of little firm ones there. 
[01:00:00]  I just...  What?  I just wanted to know if we could somehow give a round of applause to Southwest Airlines.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get inside in a second.  Okay.  Because we want to spend some time on it.  We're cranky fat people.  I'm so happy.  We want to spend some time on the fat people.  I think it's a great move.  Well, of course it is.  Marianne.  Yes.  Real fast.  What's up?  I'm just curious how many people called in yesterday saying that their kids are traumatized  for life for you guys, like, exposing their sex toys to them. 
[01:00:30]  That was a lot of fun yesterday.  We had the kids, yeah, going to Mommy and Daddy's drawers, and they found some great stuff  yesterday.  It's pretty funny when they find your sex toys.  My six-year-old found, like, one of those little silver bullet vibrators, and he comes  walking up with it, and he's like, what's this?  It's vibrating away in his hand.  I'm like, give me that thing.  I'm like, it's one of Daddy's tools.  Like...  Yeah, one of Daddy's tools.  No, it's for there when Daddy's tool isn't.  Yeah.  For there.  I stink.  As long as he didn't put it in mayo and try to make a sandwich with lettuce and tomato. 
[01:01:00]  Exactly.  Hey, Norton, I always wanted to ask you this.  You're my age, and when I was in nursery school, a little boy asked me...  Well, she can't say...  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, Marianne.  Can't say that.  How long have you been listening to this show?  Hmm, about a year, a year and a half.  No, we can't say that.  No, that can't be said on the air.  When you were in nursery school, someone asked you if you wanted to give them some yellow  discipline right in the gullet. 
[01:01:30]  Yes.  Okay.  Where'd you go to nursery school?  In Yonkers.  Oh, unfortunately, that was not me.  I was in Edison.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, okay.  All right.  What did you say, by the way?  I said, no.  Boy, some team player you are.  How bizarre.  Like, I was just like, oh, my God.  No.  Why couldn't you just help somebody out?  Well, I thought about it for a second, but then I was just, like, confused as to what  he was asking me.  Like, why would I do that at three? 
[01:02:00]  Right.  Oh, three.  All right, yeah.  Yeah.  So, okay, I was just curious.  All right, thank you.  Anybody called in saying, you know, what did you do?  All right, Marianne.  Thanks for slowing down the show.  Have a good day.  All right.  How's it doing here?  All right, Anthony, speaking of yesterday, I got a great email in my hands from a 16-year-old  female.  Yes.  She wanted to call the show yesterday.  She did the snooping thing, and she couldn't call in to, well, she was calling in, but she  couldn't get through to tell us what she found, all right?  Okay. 
[01:02:30]  So let me read this real fast.  Hi there.  I'm a 16-year-old girl who's a fan of your show.  I was listening to you on the way home from my summer job yesterday and caught part of  the segment on snooping in your parents' drawers.  As soon as I got home, I went upstairs to their room and began snooping.  Well, let me tell you, it was instant pay dirt in the form of a box sticking out from  under the bed.  This is what I found.  She's got a little list.  Yes.  16-year-old girl.  Number one.  Not one, but two dills. 
[01:03:00]  A purple one called an eager beaver.  Not only did it vibrate, but it rotates, and it has a beaver-shaped stimulator for her  extra pleasure.  I think I've seen those things.  Like, yeah, yeah, it moves around, and then right where the man in the boat is, there's  a little offshoot thing where it's a little beaver.  And it's sitting there that vibrates.  Sitting on a little log or something.  Yeah, yeah, a little log.  The other was a standard flesh-colored job.  Straight, vibrating, nothing special except for the fact that it was 10 inches. 
[01:03:30]  No joke.  Gross.  Wow.  Number two.  She found this blue rubbery spike thing called the Wireless Techno Lover.  Wireless Techno Lover?  Four, this thing slides over the man's you-know-what and gives hours of vibrating pleasure to you  both.  Or so the box says.  Don't call him on that.  It's safe to say your father is an inept zero.  Three.  A rubbery red thing called a cherry sleeve. 
[01:04:00]  The box said that the man gets this thing ready and slides it over his you-know-what and  you know it's, well, it's, oh boy.  Let me see.  The guy uses it to take care of himself.  Oh.  So he kind of, you know, gets this thing ready, puts it on, and then he-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.  It's like the thing that Bronson found in the guy's house.  It's a sleeve.  It's a sleeve.  The cherry sleeve.  What do you use this for?  Yeah.  It's an off. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, that was great.  What a great scene that was.  What do you use this for?  The guy with the gray cheeks in Ten to Midnight.  That was a good movie.  What an ass on that guy.  Four.  A thing called a silver bullet.  Yeah.  It's a silver egg-shaped thing, and it can change speeds, looks well, and it looked used, she's saying, Anthony.  Number five, some furry-covered things that I think you used to tie someone up with.  Not sure, and I really don't want to know.  Number six, a thing called a heart slapper. 
[01:05:00]  It's a leather paddle with heart cutouts.  I spent half of my younger childhood trying to avoid spankings, and now find out that one of my parents actually likes them.  Words fail me.  It's probably you smack the ass with it, and it leaves a little red mark, except for where the heart is cut out on the slapper.  So then that is a little on your butt there.  A little heart, and then you just put some icing on it.  A DV call two-on-one, which is a gangbang video.  I'm not sure what that is, but it doesn't look like something my dad would want me to see. 
[01:05:30]  And an unmarked video that I did not have the guts to put in the tape player.  I don't think I want to know.  Oh, boy.  Please put that in.  We ought to have her call when they're not home and pop the video in.  It's a good idea.  If she's listening, maybe she could do that for us.  Eight, pictures.  Yes, those instant picture things of my parents.  I tried not to look, but I felt like one of those people that stares at an accident, even though they want to look away.  I am now officially scared for my life.  Number nine, she found pictures of her parents in the act. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Number nine, some book called the, and she spelled it, Kama Sutra.  The Kama Sutra.  Kama Sutra.  And another how-to manual type book.  I'm so embarrassed that my parents need books to show them how.  Other than a few magazines, nothing else exciting.  I could not get through to you on the phones when my parents come home, so I couldn't email you until this morning.  I'm not sure whether to be horrified at what I saw, mad that I couldn't get through on the phone, or disappointed that I might miss you talking about this, unless it is between blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:06:30]  So she goes on and on.  There you go.  Wow.  She couldn't get through yesterday.  And the beautiful thing is that this specific list, hopefully her parents are listening, and as she's reading up the list, like, well, we have that.  We have that.  We have that.  Oh, my God.  And her daughter's 16.  I never found sexual...  The only thing I ever found once was a condom in the toilet that had obviously been discarded after use.  Right, yeah.  That scarred me horribly.  Oof.  Just knowing that they'd been in there enjoying each other. 
[01:07:00]  I was helping my father help one of his friends move, and I was a kid, you know, they pull the bed away.  This is his friend Jimmy.  So it pulls the bed away, and behind it are just wrappers for condoms, and those, they used to call them blue caps, I guess.  It was like a capsule that you popped the top off of and took this lamb skin sheath condom out of sheath. 
[01:07:30]  But it was floating in fluid the whole time.  Oh, wow.  And there were those, like, strewn all over the place.  And my father, I just remember him saying, hey, quite a few blue caps down here.  And they were, like, laughing, and I'm like, what's the joke?  I don't get it.  He goes, I don't know what a blue cap is.  I had no clue.  And once you grow up, those things hit you like, oh, when you get a punchline, like, ten years later.  Condoms and used condoms. 
[01:08:00]  It was just disgusting.  Pat.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right, Pat.  It's not a big part, but you guys remember The Devil's Advocate?  Yes.  Remember when the guy, he played the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off?  Remember when he gets beat to death in a park?  Yes.  Right.  Remember the jogger he went into just before that?  Yeah.  That was me.  You were the jogger?  Yeah, in the credits it says jogger in park.  Wow.  Jogger number one or jogger number two? 
[01:08:30]  No, just one, just the only jogger.  I think that was right.  He runs into me and I say, hey, buddy, watch where you're going.  And he keeps running.  He gets killed by the three bum ghosts.  Oh, I remember him.  I remember him.  You see him with the sticks?  Sure.  Great scene.  Yeah, it's in, I'm in the credits because that's what I said.  I said, hey, buddy, watch where you're going because he runs into me.  I got a great sweatshirt out with a great hood over my head.  Patrick Joseph Burns.  That's it.  It says jogger one and jogger two is Gregory Lictensen. 
[01:09:00]  I didn't know I had two joggers.  I didn't know that.  Wow.  Anything else you've done?  How much money is it now?  A couple other things, but you guys probably would never have heard of them.  I was in a bad movie called Bad Karma.  No.  I don't know if that's on there.  How much money did you get for the Devil's Advocate thing?  A thousand bucks.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, yeah, you were in that, but.  Yeah, I'm sure it's not the most famous thing you guys got, but I figured I'd give a call.  Hey, dude, were you sagged before you did that?  Yeah.  All right, Pat.  Thank you.  Okay, buddy.  All right.  Cool. 
[01:09:30]  Doesn't beat Spencer from Goodfellas.  You know, Pacino.  That was a great film, man.  Pacino.  Pretty good.  All right, we'll talk about fat people on the airlines next, okay?  But first, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  I want to give a giant F.U. to all those fat, blubbery, cellulite, cottage cheese women  out there wearing short shorts and tube tops.  They got all this crap hanging out everywhere.  Why don't you go put on a muumuu? 
[01:10:00]  Go in the house, hide, and leave the nice summer clothes to the hot women.  F*** you, F.U.  Next message.  This is a big F.U. to my boss.  That bitch.  All she does is cry all day.  The littlest thing, she's a senior executive, and she cries.  Unbelievable.  F.U., you big C.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. out to my junk.  I just found out her third child is another girl.  I can go F myself. 
[01:10:30]  My balls suck.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big F.U. out to my friend Dave, or ex-friend Dave, who decided to streak  naked through my wedding reception, and I'm going to give my freaking grandmother a heart  attack.  You know what, Dave?  F.U.  Can't wait till you get married, pal.  End of messages.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, they're wrong, baby!  Woo!  Yeah, sure. 
[01:11:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  Put your mins and get me behind us.  Take me away, don't leave it out.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  I'm 1027 WNEW.  I'm 1027 WNEW. 
[01:11:30]  You're taking out the O.P. and Anthony show today.  Let's say hi to Tawny.  What's up, Tawny?  Tawny.  Huh?  Hello, my name's Tawny.  Tawny?  Tawny.  Tawny?  Tawny.  That's what I said.  What's up?  Tawny.  Okay, hi.  Tawny, Tawny, whatever.  I just want to let you know that a gigantic fan of yours, Anthony in Philly, is putting  black and white, hands-wrong, wow stickers all over, and the poor guy can't get a wow 
[01:12:00]  anywhere.  So we had a little office party today, so I drove him into another room and wowed him.  Is that bad?  You wowed a fan of the show, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, thank you very much.  Very good.  During an office party.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  During an office party, Anthony.  That's why we don't really take the wow calls that much anymore.  See?  See?  We know what's happening.  Like crazy out there.  So thank you, ladies.  You see the wow on someone's car? 
[01:12:30]  Hey, show them a little bit if you feel like it.  Give them a flash, right?  It's all you gotta do.  All right.  Easy.  Anthony, we have started making our Andrew Dice Clay prank calls.  Yes, we have so many very cool dice clips from his various appearances and phone calls  on this show.  I do believe we started this soundboard phenomenon that is happening all over the place now.  It's so much fun.  It's all over the internet.  People are making their own.  And make their own calls.  You could call anybody. 
[01:13:00]  If you have enough clips, you could answer any, any situation that comes across on the  phone.  And we have plenty of dice clips.  So who's the first victim?  Our old friend Tom.  Tom.  Tom from New Orleans.  Who got fired from the station we're on in New Orleans.  Tom from New Orleans.  So Rick decided to call him today and mess with him with the dice clips.  Check this out.  Where's Tom?  Tommy.  You got your money?  Tommy.  Who's this?  Tony Slangini. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, Tony.  What time is it?  What time is it?  You tell me.  Who is he to call up and look to start a problem?  You know, between me and you.  You do a bad Andrew Dice click on the station.  You sound like, uh, you sound like an idiot Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  See, that doesn't hurt me.  That's like a nice thing for you to say.  Why?  Yeah, everything's going on.  You got issues, sweetheart.  Why are you talking now?  Why are you tongue-tied?  I'm not tongue-tied, baby. 
[01:14:00]  You sound like Anne from the Opie and Anthony show.  You got a boyfriend?  Yeah, Opie.  He's a little fag.  This is why there's so many problems in the world.  Because Opie's a fag?  What do you guys got a thing with faggots?  You got to talk sexy, baby.  You got to put a certain tone in your voice.  You know that.  Because Opie's a faggot?  So what?  They're faggots.  So what?  They don't know how sick they is.  Which I want.  I said personality.  You mean you got to get sick of personal.  Now I ask you.  You got a good personality. 
[01:14:30]  Which I want.  What time is it?  I don't know.  I'm going to let it go.  You know what I mean?  Hey, Rick, what's up?  McFly!  Wake up, McFly!  Hey, Rick, what's up?  I'm not afraid to say I like other men.  That's that, then.  That's the end of the call.  Dun, dun, dun.  Looks like Tom doesn't like us anymore, huh?  I don't know.  He seemed a little bit, uh, a little bitter.  He doesn't like us anymore, Ben?  I don't know. 
[01:15:00]  You don't think so?  Why?  I'm an idiot.  You're a faggot.  I'm a faggot.  What, what, uh, what got to him?  I think that Tom is, uh, he's mad that we keep saying he got fired because he keeps  trying to explain to me that he, you know, he left on his own terms and all this crap,  so I don't know.  Oh, he got fired.  He got fired.  He would have never left that station.  He loved our show.  He loved being there.  He was a star because of us down there.  Maybe they said, look, we want the station on 24 hours.  And he said, that's not happening.  And he walked away.  That's not happening, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Like, how am I supposed to keep power going to this station for this long when you're a  bunch of faggots?  Maybe he officially left before he was going to get fired.  Oh.  Forced, uh.  That old gag.  Resignation.  Happens all the time in the business world.  He told me that, you know, he was our friend and picked us up at the airport and you guys,  you know, saying he got fired on there.  But, I mean, I hadn't talked to him until the spring call today.  It was the first time I'd heard from him.  No, because when it was all going down, he was so depressed.  You could tell.  He was.  That something was going on he wasn't happy about. 
[01:16:00]  Maybe he did quit.  Huh?  Maybe he did quit.  Maybe.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, man.  I'm just flipping through the stations here.  Heading over to your station.  Sounds like they're on their way to Detroit.  And they're saying how you guys are going to love it because they've been kicking your  butts for three years.  Yeah, that's possible.  Those boars on New Jersey 101.5? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  Casey and some other guy.  Oh.  You know what?  We don't even know they exist, so.  I don't.  I don't.  Oh.  I think they're getting out of town.  So now they're thinking they can just badmouth everybody.  First of all, I've never heard of 101.5 and I've never heard of that show.  You know, it's good for an occasional traffic report.  They stink.  They suck.  Let them badmouth us.  It'll just give us more listeners.  Actually, give them a call.  It sounds like they're moving to Detroit from what they were saying. 
[01:17:00]  Give them a call.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Does this matter?  See, the fact is we don't know who they are.  They obviously know who we are, so that's why.  It just bugs the hell out of me to hear them talking like that.  Yeah, dude, you know how I know who they are just when I used to drive in from Jersey?  I needed some traffic.  That's how funny their show is.  You've got to put a little traffic on it once in a while.  Thanks for the traffic, unfunny faggot.  I have no clue.  Well, good luck in Detroit, I guess.  Yeah, maybe a big show obviously doing well on the East Coast if you're moving to the Midwest.  All right, Tom.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  You want to go from around New York to Detroit.  We go off on them, but I don't even know what they do.  I have no idea.  I've never heard of them.  I don't even know their name.  You're the first I have ever heard of them.  All right, Tom.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Thanks.  Kicking our ass.  That's funny.  Maybe they're just saying that in jest.  Maybe Tom is exaggerating.  They might have just been like being sarcastic.  You know how silly you must sound to say that your show is kicking our ass in Jersey?  We own Jersey.  Maybe it was a joke.  We own Jersey like you wouldn't believe. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, but you know what?  There are plenty of cities we suck in, but I mean, no one, no one is more popular than  us in Jersey.  Maybe it was a joke.  In this time slot, I should say.  Maybe it was sarcasm because they're getting their asses kicked and they're like, ah,  because we were beating them up so bad, we're taking off.  Like, maybe they were acknowledging them.  Who knows?  They don't even know who they are.  I know.  I really should show up.  I'm psychoanalyzing two zeros in New Jersey who are moving to Detroit.  What's wrong with me?  All right.  Nerve me.  Hey, Rock Hall.  Hey.  What's up?  I'm the very famous Boston DJ who listens to your show. 
[01:18:30]  No, we want famous people to call today, Rock Hall.  Shut up, Greg.  I am famous.  People that other people actually know.  Everybody knows me.  Well, not really.  You're famous and you're listening to us.  Yeah.  Can I come down to the station?  No.  Well, one out of two isn't bad.  You're listening to us.  Shut up.  Hi, Rock Hall.  You know what else, though?  I heard you talking about the divorce thing earlier.  Yeah.  I still am paying Birdsey. 
[01:19:00]  Now, you tell me how bad that is.  You have to pay halimony.  And Maddie and I are trying to figure out custody stuff, so it really is a pain in the  ass.  You guys are right.  All right, Rock Hall.  Bye there, fags.  Bye.  Bye, sweetie.  Ah, that guy is funny.  Boston's laughing.  Christian, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm just wondering now.  There's no Buffalo women in this contest.  In the wild contest.  By what people think, in the wild contest, there are good-looking women in Buffalo, and 
[01:19:30]  they're having a problem, besides the wild contest, of wowing us people in Buffalo.  So you're bummed out because no girls from Buffalo are in the wild contest?  Well, with the exception of the last contest you had, where there was probably, here you  go, a local reference, the Lackawanna Skank and the Black Backdoor Booty Bandit.  But there are real women here, and they're not representing worth anything.  Well, where's the A-monster?  Yeah, where's the A-monster?  Yeah, we don't need her this time. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  I don't think Buffalo should be too bummed that they don't have any girls in the contest,  okay?  Yeah, don't worry about it, Buffalo.  Even though college is out here, we do it.  This is a big-time college city, and there were good-looking women.  There are still good-looking women.  We'll join all the fine women from all over the country on opianthony.com.  Don't worry, Buffalo.  All right.  Everyone else got your back.  All right.  You guys talk.  North Euro.  Bye.  Thanks, fellas.  Yeah, don't worry about us, Buffalo.  Remember the A-monster check? 
[01:20:30]  Yep.  So some show that we never heard of is kicking our ass, Anthony.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, sure.  I've heard of that.  That makes you feel better.  I'm starting to think that was some sarcasm.  It would have to be.  Who not?  Whatever.  It would have to be.  It's silly.  I've heard this.  It's horrendous.  It's the type of thing you listen to, like, to look at how bad other things are, and it  really is.  It's unfunny.  Why do so many people have a problem with us, Anthony? 
[01:21:00]  I don't know.  Just here, doing our show, hanging with our pals, hanging with our listeners.  Well, I think because we're perceived as, like, the guys that are, you know, that go  around doing that kind of thing.  No, I'll explain.  You guys can't do it for yourself.  They're going to be the tough guy, you know.  You're funny, and you're the best ones on, and they all have to, you guys can't say  that because you would seem ego, but you're the best ones on, and that's what bothers  us.  We do anyway.  All right.  We say it anyway.  Seems like there's a lot of bitter people out there.  Plenty of bitter people. 
[01:21:30]  For whatever reason.  All right.  Airlines?  Why didn't they send their tape here?  Yeah.  Why didn't they send their tape to New York City?  They're so great.  We're looking for, like, two or three shows here in New York.  Believe me.  Why do you have to go all the way to Detroit?  If you're that great, send a tape to us.  There's a slot waiting.  Just waiting.  Just eagerly awaiting a program.  It is.  We have meetings all the time about it.  Really?  What's going in here?  Who's going here? 
[01:22:00]  Do we put one show in?  Do we split it up?  Do we put a smaller show here and here?  And then there's, you know, stuff like that.  Love you, babe.  Love you.  Then we have the DVDs and, or the CDs and tapes of various programs.  There's a goddamn gospel show sent something in.  That they're considering.  Yeah.  It was that good.  It's like, what the hell?  Praise Jesus.  Get a little Jesus before this friggin' hell that is our program. 
[01:22:30]  Why not have some gospel?  I mean, at least that would probably have some, you know, some humor in it.  Hey, you never know, right?  Who knows?  So we'll just, we're sitting and waiting to see what ends up.  All right.  Stacy and Amanda, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  Where are you girls calling from?  Peabody, Massachusetts.  Peabody.  Peabody.  Peabody.  Where are you calling from?  Peabody.  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard anybody say.  Peabody.  It's Peabody.  Okay, Boston. 
[01:23:00]  Peabody, not Peabody.  They call it Peabody.  I don't care what they call it.  It's Peabody, you idiot.  It's spelled like Peabody for everyone else in the country, but what do they call it?  What do they call it, girls?  Peabody.  Peabody.  Peabody.  I love the accent.  I went through that when I was 12.  Peabody.  Peabody.  Can we queef now?  Oh, hey.  Wow.  Are you girls calling for the 6 o'clock queef?  Yeah.  Yeah, let me queefinate this.  We want to bring this back onto our show, so.  Are you guys side by side right now? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  All right, let's play the song.  Okay.  Here we go.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles, make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tears up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  All right, ladies.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Okay, whenever you're ready.  Go ahead.  Okay. 
[01:24:00]  Okay.  All right, let's go. 
[01:24:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  Stop already.  Wow, that sounds like a snorting pig.  Hello?  No, no, no.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Yeah?  Hello?  Yeah?  Yeah?  Very good.  Thank you.  It's not a verb.  It's not a part.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef. 
[01:25:00]  It's not too late.  Let's make a wish.  It's like a fart.  But sounds like fish at six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tiss up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  We were going to go to break, but another high-speed police chase near downtown L.A.  This one is rocking.  This guy is flying.  This cannot end good because there's more traffic on the road.  And this guy is moving so fast.  Because he's now passing people on the left-hand side. 
[01:25:30]  Like, further than the left lane.  Look how close he's coming to these people.  This is going to end pretty good, I hope.  That's what we always say.  Yeah, but this has the makings for true disaster.  You think?  The guy is flying.  He is flying.  And there's a lot more cars on the road.  He's zigging and zagging.  Look at this.  He's coming up in between.  Oh, that pussy got out of the way.  Yeah, good thing.  He got out of the way.  Another guy that thinks he could outrun the cops in a helicopter.  Look at this guy.  Right between the rail and the guy in the left lane. 
[01:26:00]  He's got to be going about, what, Ant?  At least 90, right?  He's going about, yeah, anywhere between 80 and 90.  80 and 90?  Somewhere in there.  Now he's got to, he's back in the left lane.  And now the one lane over, he's zigging and zagging.  Because there's a few cars on that road.  But they're spaced out enough where he really hasn't had to let off the gas yet.  Uh-huh.  I'm hoping for a big, fiery rear-ender.  Rick!  Yeah, guys, just before you picked up on this, he almost had a fiery rear-ender when he got off the highway. 
[01:26:30]  He was actually going the other direction.  Yeah.  Zipped off the exit because there was too much traffic.  Almost hit the cars in front of him.  Then went underneath an overpass on the wrong side of the road and came up the other side.  So this guy's a nut.  Hey, Rick, have you ever been involved in a fiery rear-ender?  I can't answer that.  Goodbye.  All right.  Do we know why this guy's running?  Anyone?  Bueller?  Oh, wow, he's cutting across.  He's going to be the big banana. 
[01:27:00]  Keith Thomas in Brisbane, Australia.  And Mr. Thomas, as you well know, the big banana in Afghanistan.  Is that on the car's eye?  So they go on rent.  We are going to go on to a special report with Britt Hume.  And as we go, let's keep an eye on this chase in L.A.  It is an ending, but it will eventually.  Here's Britt.  It's the hottest thing on TV, man, these car chases.  You go away.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, go to, go to, uh, where else did they happen? 
[01:27:30]  That'd be great.  Fox sucks.  What are you doing?  Fox, what are you, stupid?  Are you insane?  It's leaked from Capitol Hill.  Peter's interviews.  Oh, my God.  Now they're showing the missing white kid.  Oh, my God.  Who cares who they...  Oh, God.  Oh, Fox.  Fox, you suck.  He's just doing the 6 o'clock news.  Why are they doing this?  You got all that other junk all over the screen. 
[01:28:00]  Give us a little box in the corner.  There's a box.  There's a box in the corner.  Oh, here we go.  Thanks.  Are we back?  California Highway Patrol says the vehicle is stolen, and the LAPD say the suspect is wanted  for grand theft auto.  It all began near the L.A. Coliseum, near downtown L.A.  Apparently, an officer tried to pull this car over for a traffic violation, but the car refused  to stop.  At this point, there are two air and four ground units pursuing this car. 
[01:28:30]  Here we go.  Again, the driver originally refused to stop.  This is all going on right now on Freeway 60.  It began near downtown L.A.  Black guy or colored guy?  In other news.  Ah!  No other news.  All right, we'll break.  Son of a...  Can I see your taint?  Nice.  Taint nice.  Taint nice.  Between the peach and the balloon knot.  Can we see your butt?  Nice.  I would have to just blank on your chin.  Does this guy know how to party or what? 
[01:29:00]  Okay, terrific.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Somebody wants to apologize to us.  Oh. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, who's this?  Steve.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, I just want to tell you guys in Sacramento today, the flags were flying in half staff.  And everyone's walking around with their heads hanging.  Because of old Renee posting a picture.  Yeah, I guess you couldn't see the ringers this time around for our contest.  Well, we'll see about that.  We'll see.  You got one really fine-looking lady and...  It's not over yet.  And one pig representing Sacramento in the WOW Contest.  He's a little nice.  Yeah, he should have been shot walking through the door.  Go to opianthony.com to check out the latest contestants. 
[01:30:00]  I don't think we got any new girls today, really.  Nah.  Not that I thought.  During the show, a few girls pop up.  Nothing new today.  One of my favorites is the drunk chick.  The drunk chick from Chicago is great.  She's got a yellow Disney shirt on.  Right.  All pulled up over her huge cans.  She's got like a...  She looks like Bobby Fleckman from Spinal Tap.  Yeah.  I'm Bobby Fleckman, you know, you know. 
[01:30:30]  And she looks hammid.  And she's drinking in the pictures.  Like she couldn't stop drinking for two seconds.  Maybe she was nervous, Anthony.  It's like a margarita.  All right.  And now, uh, Sean has a little problem.  All right.  Maybe we can help.  Hey, Sean.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's going on, man?  All right.  What can we do for you today?  Chilling.  Um, I got these sexual problems, man.  Yeah.  Well, keep it clean for the radio.  All right.  All right.  I'll try. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Um, I don't know.  Let's just...  Uh, did I...  I ain't playing, man.  Well, what would, uh, when...  Hold on.  I don't know.  They might have dumped out of that.  I'll just...  Let's just say you can't get to the point you need to get to to have sex.  Physically.  Physically.  How old are you?  18.  Well, maybe you don't want to really have sex and you think you're supposed to want to.  No, I have.  I've had already, man.  So when did it...  When did you stop being able to perform?  Yeah, it's like three months. 
[01:31:30]  You're doing drugs?  Whoa.  Maybe you got whiskey, D.  Yeah, I was just...  Um, I do smoke.  Are you nervous in bed?  Huh?  Are you nervous when you're having sex?  Crazy.  Are you...  Can you ever achieve that?  Hold on, hold on, because they probably dumped out of that, too.  You can't get to that state ever?  No.  Even when you're by yourself?  No.  See, what happened between the time you were able to and now that is different? 
[01:32:00]  Um, I don't know.  Maybe it is a drug.  Have you done different drugs?  Are you doing more drugs?  No, it's just...  I mean, I've experienced, yeah, but I do...  I mean, I smoke every day.  Are you on medication?  Um...  Like a love life.  Yeah, I just started on this, like, antidepressant.  Antidepressants, yeah, they do that.  They kill it.  I'll be Dr. Drew.  And why are you on these drugs?  Well, because, um, I got really depressed and stuff when I started using heavy drugs. 
[01:32:30]  So they gave you more drugs?  Yeah, so...  No, they gave me this stuff because they thought I was depressed.  And what's the drug?  Um, lithium.  I want to make sure I avoid that one.  Okay.  Lithium.  Yeah.  Yeah, antidepressants.  That's probably what's going on.  So, what the hell should I do, man?  Well, get happy and, uh, get off the drugs.  As easy as that.  Yeah.  Are you still doing the illegal drugs that made you a mess in the first place? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Well, some people can handle it and some people can't.  You're one of the guys that can't handle, uh, drugs.  I'm all for people that can't handle the drugs.  Just do them.  Have a pisser with them, man.  Yeah, right?  Have fun.  But, if you can't deal with it, what kind of drugs were you doing?  The harder stuff.  Well, I was doing, like, E and acid, all that.  E and A?  X?  Uh-huh.  Acid, acid.  S?  Acid.  Yeah.  Acid.  Acid.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Ooh, boy.  What's going on in your life that you gotta be doing a lot of drugs all the time?  I don't know, man.  I mean, like, I'm in this, like, band now.  Yeah.  Like, I mean, we're not getting big and stuff, but, like, we're trying out.  Not at all.  Huh?  It's like a rock group, you know?  Right.  You got a little rock band.  Yeah.  And, uh, you're playing music and you're doing drugs.  Yeah.  Well, you're on your way to stardom.  Yeah, I mean, that's true, man.  Jim Morrison was impotent from what I heard.  Oh, yeah?  After a certain point because of the drugs, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  How are you 18 and impotent?  Nah, I don't know.  I mean...  Wow.  18, it was like...  Yeah, I mean, like, I've been to rehab, like, a couple times, really.  Hey, what do you do in the band?  These have got chicks in rehab.  You just bring drugs.  Yeah, what do you do in the band?  Um, I'm a singer.  I lead sing.  Yeah.  You lead sing.  Yeah.  It would be really depressing if you were the drummer, right?  Yeah.  Then you'd have an excuse for doing those drugs.  Yeah.  You know, you'd be trying to play the drums and the sticks would just be soft and limp. 
[01:34:30]  Do you have a problem with the...  Oh, no!  No, it's going to get done.  Hello?  All right, what was that?  All right, who's that?  Huh?  Who's the idiot?  What was that?  Oh, some dickhead hair.  Oh, where are you?  All right, you guys got to put the drugs...  Put the drugs down, man.  Where are you?  Where I live?  No, are you at home right now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I thought maybe you were at an institution. 
[01:35:00]  No.  And who was yelling and screaming?  Well, it was a neighbor.  He was in my house.  He was a dealer.  All right, well, I don't know.  You just admitted to 25 cities that you can't get the job done.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Good luck with the band.  Yeah.  All right, you guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  This guy's really depressed.  It's called being a kid.  Happens to everyone.  It's called being a kid.  You're bummed all the time.  You know, and there are times you're really, like, you're really happy. 
[01:35:30]  You get very manic when you're at that age.  You just got to deal with it.  Stop doing the drugs.  Whether they're...  If you can't deal with smoking some pot, I couldn't deal with smoking weed anymore.  That's what happened to me.  I love my beer.  I love some Captain Morgan and Coke.  I love it.  But pot and Coke.  Freaked me up.  Captain Morgan and Coke and Coke.  No, I don't do drugs.  I don't like doing drugs.  So I stopped doing them.  They made me freak out a little bit.  I was watching Grey Lady Down. 
[01:36:00]  Charlton Heston's submarine movie.  Remember that?  I don't remember.  The sub sank.  And it was almost below hull crush depth.  You know?  And it was resting on a ledge on the bottom of the ocean.  And if it went over the ledge, it would have just, you know...  And everyone dead.  So it's just resting there.  They had to send a rescue little sub down and hook up to the hatch.  And it was a big involved movie.  But the whole time, the whole thing of oxygen and lighting and claustrophobia was just taken over in this movie. 
[01:36:30]  I'm sitting in the big cushy chair in the living room.  And I'm watching the movie.  And I'm smoking weed.  This movie is the best...  The best...  The best...  The best...  The best move...  The best move...  The best move...  And I'm watching...  Like, this is so cool. 
[01:37:00]  Look how the sub is underwater.  Like, that looks really cool like a real underwater sub.  Man.  What do you...  What do you think it's like being in a sub?  It'd probably be cool if you're like under the water.  Yeah.  So.  I bet it's... 
[01:37:30]  I bet it's small in there.  Probably, like, really tight.  God.  Oh, imagine being, like, stuck on the bottom of the ocean floor and your...  Oxygen runs out and you're...  So much water above you and...  You can't get rescued.  How the hell...  Oh, my God.  I'm having a panic attack.  Oh, my God.  All right.  What do I do?  Oh, my God.  I'm freaking out.  Put the joint down.  Drink milk. 
[01:38:00]  One more.  All right.  I got to get in the shower right now.  I don't know why, but I have to take a cold shower with all my clothes on.  That was the last time you spoke about it?  That was the last time I spoke about it.  I went into my bedroom.  I laid in the bed.  I curled up in the fetal position and just sat there with horrific, horrific thoughts of what it would feel like if you were actually in a submarine that was being crushed by the water and running out of oxygen.  And I just...  After it wore off, I said to myself, you know something? 
[01:38:30]  I can't smoke pot.  Oh, well.  Life's a bitch.  I enjoyed the weed when I was having a good time with it, but I really don't need to deal with that situation again.  So I stopped smoking the pot.  And then I went to what they call the cocaine after that.  Because that would help in a sub, you know, underneath the water.  Well, you know something?  When you were snorting the cocaine, you really didn't get out of anything.  You just get out and lift the sub.  Right.  I will get out.  I can hold my breath and push the goddamn submarine to the surface. 
[01:39:00]  And incidentally...  And I'll paint it on the way up.  Being your Hulk-crushed damn pro...  You described every sub movie ever made.  Oh, of course I did.  It could have been anything.  It could have been Operation Petticoat.  It would have freaked me out.  It was the weed.  That's what I'm saying.  I can't deal with the weed.  Look at Timmy.  Timmy, go ahead.  Yo, oh, hey.  One, I used to do a lot of coke, right?  And I would sit up until, like, say, 6 o'clock in the morning in PlayStation, right?  Sure, that's my skull.  Then, you know, I straight myself out. 
[01:39:30]  I was like most bipolar, manic depressive.  When I did the coke, I used to get, you know, like, turtle pecker?  Like, you shrink, it wouldn't work.  So, now, like, with my anti-depressants, I take Elizabeth, which is an lithium derivative.  I take four tablets, two, two twice a day.  Before I go back, I take this stuff called Trazendol.  Trazendol, one of the side effects is it gives you a raging motor.  You can cut diamonds with it.  So, you know, they give Trazendol to old men before Viagra.  That's classic. 
[01:40:00]  It's awesome.  I got a diamond cut of P.E.K.K.A.  It's the greatest thing in the world.  Thank you, Timmy.  You, uh, I don't know, though.  You can't be taking...  It must be hard to have to go through life every day.  You got to take certain drugs or something to keep you level-headed, right?  You know, the occasional Tic-Tac Xanax, you know, whatever.  But when you're, you know, you got to pop the lithium every day,  and then at night you got to take this.  It seems like a real hassle.  Then again, the options are suicide or murdering someone and going to jail.  Popping lithium is not that bad. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, John, what's up?  Dude, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, oh, my God.  Me and my friend got Fifth Avenue weed.  That's basically weed with, like, laced with Coke.  It was the greatest.  We were going to see Independence Day, right?  Oh, dude.  Sorry, sorry.  Hold on, hold on.  Sorry about that.  Let him get that.  All right, continue.  Sorry about that.  Holy ass what?  He was freaking out that aliens were going to calm down  because he actually thought the movie was real.  I think it was the Coke, really.  And he started crying.  We had him, like, calm him down and this and that. 
[01:41:00]  What movie was it?  Independence Day.  You should have cried.  It sucked.  It was real.  Yeah, oh, my God.  It was the greatest.  He stopped doing weed right after that.  He thought the aliens were coming to get him?  Yeah, he was an ass anyway.  It didn't matter.  All right, thank you.  Thanks.  Later.  Ashley had the same thing happen to her that happened to Anne.  Ashley.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  That's so weird.  I had the same, like, paranoid feeling that I would be under the ocean  and, like, all this water would be under me.  Really? 
[01:41:30]  That's so weird.  Do you want to smoke some pot?  Yeah.  I'm actually going to go pick up right now.  You want to smoke some pot?  No.  Yeah, I just, it was then I realized, and that was it,  that I couldn't smoke pot anymore.  And that was it.  I was bummed about it because I kind of enjoyed the fun I would have  with my friends smoking the weed.  But that was it.  So I still have my vices and stuff.  I like that.  Like I said, I like the beers.  I like the Captain Morgan. 
[01:42:00]  Jack Daniels every so long.  Ashley sounds like she's smoking weed.  Yeah, I smoke a lot.  So you still smoke, but do you freak out?  I do, a lot.  Yeah?  What happens?  I don't know.  Like, I start thinking that everyone's, like, out to get me.  And, like, I start thinking for the feds all the time.  The feds?  That's like a Coke thing, man.  Everyone that used to come over to the house to do some Coke over at my house  would, like, sit there, and they're groaning their teeth,  and they're always looking out the window.  Always looking out the window for the cops that are going to bust in. 
[01:42:30]  Put the shades down, man.  Well, it's better to be paranoid than, like, you will not be aware of this.  Ashley?  What's up?  We are going to do Stoner Spelling Bee next week.  Wow.  Something we haven't done in a long time.  She sounds like a good candidate.  Jim Brewer is coming in.  He's going to help us with the game.  Oh, that would be awesome.  It's the only reason Jim Brewer is coming in, matter of fact,  to help us with Stoner Spelling Bee.  I love to.  Would you like to be part of the game?  I would love to.  All right, hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  I think that's going to go down either Monday or Tuesday next week, Anthony. 
[01:43:00]  Where do you want me to go?  Line 8, down there, national.  Uh, okay.  Kevin?  Hey, Opie, man, whatever you were smoking, man, I'll take whatever's left.  That sounded like some excellent weed that you had, man.  Oh, my weed?  Yeah, that was Anthony's weed.  No, it was normal weed.  I just, it freaked me out.  And I was always on the, I guess on the edge with weed.  Like, I'd smoke it and feel really good, you know, you're smoking it.  And then any time it could just turn on me. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, paranoia, it just gets you, huh?  Yeah, it wouldn't be, like, ridiculous, like it was with the submarine thing.  It wouldn't be completely ridiculous.  But there'd always be, like, this little, like, where you'd be like, oh, wait, I'm, I don't know, I can't quite put my finger on it.  But I'm not having as good a time as I was having two minutes ago.  But I really can't put my finger on it.  Like, I'm more nervous and I'm just kind of like, you know, I don't know why.  And that's freaking me out.  So I just, I stopped doing it. 
[01:44:00]  So you graduated from that onto the Coke?  That went to the Coke.  And that got to the point where it was just like, you know, not even a mental thing.  It was just physically this stuff will kill you.  It just will kill you eventually.  You can't sit there with your heart doing redlining thinking that, you know, this is a good thing.  You're trying to whack it back when you're all coked out.  Honestly, it's so awful.  It's like just tugging on a baby's nose.  A baby's nose. 
[01:44:30]  It's just little and awful and it does nothing.  That's the funniest thing.  It is completely, picture getting out, getting out of a cold pool.  You have to hold it up.  Remember when you, you keep grabbing it and it keeps slipping out.  Come here, you little slippery fella.  Remember when you go to the beach or something, it was cold and you were a kid and you'd get  home and you took your swimming trunks off and it was just nothing there.  Nothing. 
[01:45:00]  That is how it is with Coke.  But, let me, I'll put in the but right now, put in the but, if you did get it going, you  would, it would be just unstoppable for the whole goddamn night.  I never could on Coke, man.  No?  Oh, it was awful.  Yeah.  It was almost like, you know how bad it is when you're in the completely non-in-the-mood  state?  Right.  And you're still pointing straight out. 
[01:45:30]  That's how you know you have no blood flowing down there.  It's gone beyond hanging.  Yeah, it can't hang.  It's gotten even smaller where now it's pulled back off and it's pointing.  It's just kind of looking out like the front of the ship.  Oh, that is really funny.  Oh, your bag's all tight.  Everyone, everyone that did that, whenever I see people that I knew back then and they're  still doing it, you just got to look and go, what are you insane? 
[01:46:00]  There's a time in everyone's life where I believe at some level, whatever you can handle,  you should check out some stuff.  Whether it's smoking a doom, you want to do a little toot, but you got to be sure of your  own self that you can deal with it and the second you realize that, you know, maybe this  isn't the best thing.  Maybe all my money is going to cocaine.  You know, maybe that's a problem.  You got to be able to stop doing it.  Just realize it. 
[01:46:30]  But other people that can handle it and have the means, go ahead.  Go to town.  Have fun.  Have fun.  Jay, what's up?  What's up, dude?  I'm sorry, dude.  I can tell you how to beat this, first of all.  Second of all, I thought I was the biggest fan because I thought I was the only one who  went through that.  Do what?  I would smoke.  I'd get paranoid and I'd stop smoking for a long time.  Yeah.  The way I beat it is this.  You drink, you drink most of the night, you hang out, you can't stop moving, and then  you go out to the parking lot, you smoke, and then you drink some more. 
[01:47:00]  Dude, that would make me puke if I used to drink it.  No, but you got to pace yourself.  All right, man.  I would always have to vomit if you would make me lightheaded and dizzy.  I had to smoke first and then drink to balance, but if I drank first and smoked, I was vomiting  like an animal.  Really?  See, I drink rum and coke, then I go out, I just take a couple of coax, come back in,  drink a little bit more, and just mellow out, and in the club, I'm doing good.  I'm all right.  Do you know what makes you puke, too, man, when you're drinking, and then you give the 
[01:47:30]  guy from Slap Happy a Hummer?  All right.  All right.  Jay from D.C.  Worse than that was the time I ate a bunch of mushrooms at a party, came home and watched  the movie Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde.  Remember that one where he turned into the chick?  He goes, I spent four hours in the bathroom looking in the mirror to see the tease I thought  I was growing.  See, it can freak you out, man.  This guy knows a drug that'll get you aroused to the point that you're going to need surgery. 
[01:48:00]  Dave.  Hello.  Hey, Dave.  Oh, hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, listen, that guy who was talking before about the Trazodone.  Yeah.  Taking that a night and getting an all-nighter.  Yeah.  There's a condition called pridipism.  Yep.  And what it means is by 30% of people that take that drug get one that doesn't go away.  Right.  That surgical intervention is required.  Yeah, or else you'll get gangrene, like the oxygen in the blood that's going to the unit 
[01:48:30]  runs out of, the blood runs out of oxygen, can't get back out, and proceeds to die, and  all the tissue around it isn't getting oxygen anymore.  It dies.  Your junk will turn black and fall off.  It becomes brain dead.  It happens all the time.  Your mule becomes brain dead.  Brain dead.  They have to, it'll fall up.  Yeah, they got to go in and open up the little valves that hold it.  How bad would that be if your mule became like retarded and was always drooling into a 
[01:49:00]  diaper?  The worst part is, after they do the surgery, that's it.  No more.  The exit of it is all like, it's like a lip after a stroke.  It's all literally downhill after that.  It totally ignores you like an autistic.  Yeah, dude, they have to amputate sometimes with those guys, those, those, um, when you  become aroused and you can't become unaroused, they have to amputate.  That's right. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, great.  Thanks, uh, Dave.  Bird, bird, bird badge lips, uh, from Delaware.  It ends up, it's just the tip and a wrinkle.  Half a roll of skirts.  How long?  The tip and the wrinkle.  Ah, that is really funny.  How awful would that be?  It turns black, it starts to smell.  It's a gangrene.  It's just rotting away while it's on you.  We get it, Jim.  We get it. 
[01:50:00]  What?  I'm not trying to be sexy.  John, what's up?  Hey, man, the ones love you guys.  Oh, cool.  What's up?  Hey, listen, man.  One night I went out and got high with a bunch of my friends who, to this day, they all still  get high.  And, uh, they frickin' left me at this bar.  Hey, hey.  How did you say effing?  Oh, sorry.  They effing left me at this bar.  Yeah, you can't use that F word.  Yeah, I know this doesn't...  Even with R?  Sorry.  I know this doesn't sound like a radio show, but...  Yeah.  We are on the radio.  We still have to adhere to the rules.  And, uh, anyway, so I went home, like, so stoned, and I was feeling like that same nervous, 
[01:50:30]  like, little tick, and couldn't sleep, and I turned on HBO, and what do they have in  The Truth About Alex on?  Is that the one where he was gay?  Wait, what's that?  Is that the one where Alex was gay?  Right.  Remember, he's a football player?  Right.  And, like, he goes to the bar and gets it from the other guys, and the rest of the team  finds out.  Wasn't Scott Baio in that one?  I never smoked pot again after watching that stupid-ass movie.  What?  Was Alex gay, though, or was the guy in the prison chaplain just winking at him while they 
[01:51:00]  were singing religious songs?  Alex was the song.  I was a wandering sheep.  Exactly.  Hold!  All right!  God, that is so funny.  Why would that movie freak this guy out?  I don't know.  Touch your filthy hole, you scum!  And then it's on, and I'm so high, and I'm like, man, why are people gay?  And I was trying to, like, find, like, the meaning of life and, like, trying to figure 
[01:51:30]  everything out.  Like, why are all these, you know, why is this movie on HBO?  Why am I watching it?  Why am I this hot?  Right.  You think too much.  Right.  If you're doing the weed and you think too much, it'll freak you out.  And every time I would smoke pot, I'd think, and just, it would go one step to the next  until, of course, you end up with, like, why are we here on this planet?  Right.  What happens when you die? 
[01:52:00]  Remember Mr. Spocky?  Look at my thumb.  80 movies?  I'm looking at my thumb.  Don't ever do mushrooms and watch that movie.  I'm bending my thumb.  It's the same thumb that's going to be on that corpse when I die.  All right.  Stop.  Now you sit there and just...  Does a bug feel it when I cut it in half?  What would it be like to be cut in half?  Could you see your guts for a few seconds before the blood pressure and your head drops enough 
[01:52:30]  to shut your eyeballs off?  I don't know.  I'm thinking you'd see your intestines for a second or two.  Even though the horror wouldn't last long because you'd die, it would be some intense horror  for that second or two.  Like, you see your guts.  I think I'll switch to coke now.  Well, there's radio, there's edgy, there's psychotic, and then there's O&M. 
[01:53:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The guys are an undisciplined style, wielding ultimate power.  Ronnie from the Ron and Fez Show in the studio.  Hey, Ron.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show wrapping up.  Ron and Fez up next here in New York City.  Ron, where are you on O&M?  Hi, Ron.  Hi, Ron.  This doesn't even sound like us, man. 
[01:53:30]  We sound way more masculine than that.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Hey, Frank.  Frank, we're on a fence.  Hi, Frank.  Hi, Frank.  Come on.  We sound nothing like that.  Let's go to Barry, Barry, around a fence.  Hi, Barry.  Hi, Barry.  Come on, man.  People get the whole...  You know you're on all these other stations and they don't know.  Right.  It's a little inside for everybody else.  Right.  It makes us chuckle.  It was just a radio guy with two guys with two different apartments.  That's it.  I don't want to go listen to all the message boards. 
[01:54:00]  Two different apartments.  That's all it is.  So I understand.  You see what's freaking you out with the drug talk, right?  Yeah, I don't like all the drug talk anymore.  Not good, right?  No.  I get nostalgic.  Did you?  Oh, it just makes it sad.  Seriously.  I honestly think I might have one long weekend left of me.  Do you?  Yeah.  I know I can't.  I know I wouldn't.  Like, I wouldn't be able to.  No.  One last time.  It's like Dream Week with baseball.  We go back.  You sure?  We're a little older.  We're moving slower. 
[01:54:30]  Hi, Fez.  Fez.  Fez, you're on the show.  Hi, Fezzy.  Quit making fun of the wave, Ronnie.  Talk.  Right.  I came down here to say that.  Hi, Norton.  Hi, Fezzy.  Fezzy, I'm here.  I'm at the cool table with the hetero guys.  I'll talk to you later, all right?  Oh, that's why I'm here.  Oh.  That's great.  Take my place to geometry class.  Let's see you later.  I'll talk into the jocks now.  Fantasy drug camp.  Why not?  I smell bit.  Where one weekend, everyone just... 
[01:55:00]  Mitchell Walters can actually host it and take it away.  Lock it up.  All right, now we're going to go through chopping.  Here we go.  Where everyone just forgets about the little commitment they made to stop doing the dope.  Right.  And we just buy a bunch of drugs  Seriously, my heart feels stronger than ever  No, no  My heart used to actually feel like a Pong machine  Just going back and forth  And I would lay there and just talk to Jesus constantly  If you get me through this, everything's changing 
[01:55:30]  I was just about to make a change  God damn it  Did you guys do an asset?  One time I actually ran away from the moon  Just took off running as hard as I could  Scared F-less as the moon came up  I just went, what the F  They're here  As I knew it would happen  You got monkeys we're eating  Oh, I just turned his phone  I said, we gotta get out of here  I'm grabbing people, go, come on, follow me  Go, go, go, go, go  Remember that story Brewer told about 
[01:56:00]  He was in the parking lot of a concert  And he's walking around the parking lot with his friend  And his friend's like, come here  And they're on acid and they're freaking out  And Brewer's like all paranoid  And his friend's like, no, we gotta find a good spot  To smoke weed, come with me, come with me  And Brewer starts thinking  This is my buddy and everything  But where's he taking me?  And what does he want to do to me once we get there?  He seems a little eager  And this is his whole mindset  And then as he's walking to the parking lot  His friend turns around and goes  Come here, man, what are you waiting for? 
[01:56:30]  And Brewer said he looked down  And there was an oil spot  In the parking lot from a car  That had been leaking oil  And he goes, that's what he's doing  He wants me to step into the darkness  No, it didn't happen  Because if I step into the darkness  I can't leave the darkness  The oil spot was the darkness  That his friend was leading him to  You wonder why people just kill their friends  Out of nowhere  We were doing acid  We had a great time  I had to stick a knife in his heart  And then you cut their eyeball out 
[01:57:00]  And then you put a hose in there  Somehow that's gonna help  Because it cleared out the bad part of his brain  I was smoking dust one time  I'm walking home  And I have a personal pan pizza  In my hand  And I'm a knick-knack right now  I'm no longer a human being  I'm a cartoon character, right?  I look down at a personal pan pizza  And I just freeze up  I'm scared going  How did I get so goddamn big?  I thought somehow on the walk 
[01:57:30]  I had gotten so large  That this pizza  This large pizza  Had thrown down in my huge hand  And I'm thinking  If I walk backwards  Maybe I can undo  This horrible thing  And you know  I'm at you know  Fifteen at the time  And I'm thinking  How am I gonna explain to my parents  The size I've gotten  That's awful  One thing you never do  Is take acid  And then go see 
[01:58:00]  Especially this was right  When it came out  American Werewolf in London  Right  I was sitting there  Watching the scene  Where he changes into the werewolf  And it was pretty good  For the time  There was no CGI  They had his snout coming out  And his feet  And he's screaming in pain  I was more horrified  Than any other time in my life  The sheer terror  And there's nothing you can do  Because your buddies are there  Sure  And I don't know  If they're feeling the same way  But what are you gonna do?  Run out in the theater screaming?  Because they'll never let you live that down 
[01:58:30]  I'd still be getting phone calls  Remember that time?  Hold on  Yeah  Just keep it together  You are like  You're on a thread  Right  You're constantly on a thread  Going  Hold it together  Hold it together  Hold it  I'm gonna turn into this werewolf  Shut up  Get the bad thoughts out of my head  Right  Please  Shut up  Don't go there  We gotta step aside for these guys  Yes  Alright we'll keep the drug talk going  Yes Jimmy  Happy anniversary  I just gotta say  Happy one year anniversary  To the H family
