<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a caller launching a furious, obscenity-laced tirade against the hosts and their content, culminating in a threat to visit the radio station.  This is followed by a comedic bit: a parody of O.J. Simpson making absurd and inappropriate 911 calls.

The majority of the show centers on the aftermath of a contentious interview with The Rock.  The hosts, visibly angry, dissect The Rock's abrupt departure from the interview, triggered by offensive material on a website associated with a guest, Sick Boy.  They vehemently deny knowledge of the offensive content, arguing that The Rock overreacted and should have addressed his concerns directly.  Studio guest Steve, from the show's unofficial website, reinforces their perspective, providing further details about Sick Boy’s reaction.  Numerous callers join the discussion, expressing divided opinions on the hosts’ handling of the situation and the validity of The Rock’s accusations. The hosts also engage in a debate about freedom of speech online and accuse The Rock of hypocrisy regarding racial stereotypes in light of his own wrestling career in the WWF. A Rouse.com representative calls, promising to send a nude model to the studio for the scheduled guest, Lewis Black (who, however, does not appear during this portion of the show).  The arrest of Rosie Perez for protesting nuclear testing in Puerto Rico is briefly mentioned.

The program continues with a discussion of a previous rock show segment, transitioning into a detailed and profane "F-word lesson," exploring the etymology and grammatical usage of the word "fuck." An email from AJ from Brooklyn is read, highlighting perceived double standards in racial humor.

Comedian Lewis Black then joins the show.  Their conversation covers Black's recent activities (including skiing to avoid family time), his experiences performing around the holidays, and his perspective on the Y2K scare and the excessive security measures surrounding the millennium. They discuss the lack of actual Y2K problems and the widespread societal paranoia.  A call from Jay Moore in Hollywood follows, discussing the show's increasing popularity, referencing a previous, successful segment involving gay phone sex.  Moore recounts awkward encounters with Hollywood directors, highlighting the industry's absurdity and his own frustrations.  The conversation, peppered with offensive language, circles back to The Rock.  The discussion returns to Lewis Black, focusing on the overreaction to Y2K, disappointing show attendance, increased surveillance, and the absurdity of certain news coverage of the Y2K event.  The segment ends with mention of a promised appearance by a naked woman from a website and plugs for various sponsors, including Paisano's restaurant. Profanity, crude humor, and offensive language are prevalent throughout.

A later segment features a discussion about Rouse.com, with Christy, a Miami Dolphins cheerleader and editor for the site, as a studio guest.  The hosts joke about a previous guest, Luba, who didn't disrobe on air despite having nude photos online.  Christy is playfully, and persistently, pressured to undress on air for the audience and Lewis Black, ultimately removing most of her clothing while dancing. Lewis Black is left speechless. The conversation shifts back to the contentious interview with The Rock; a clip is played where The Rock accuses Sick Boy's website of racist comments.  Callers share their experiences protesting The Rock at a book signing. The segment concludes with further discussion of The Rock's reaction and the hosts' defense, interspersed with playful banter and a prank call where a listener wins a "100 grand" candy bar instead of $100,000.  Crude and offensive language and sexually suggestive humor persist.

The show's final segment begins with an advertisement for Stacker 2, followed by an announcement of a Seton Hall Pirates basketball game ticket giveaway, and mentions of future Seton Hall promotions, including a potential Final Four giveaway.  A humorous bulk email detailing "17 ways women fail in bed" is discussed, followed by a brief, crude description of its contents.  The conversation then turns to John Rocker, accompanied by the playing of a satirical song, "All Up New York Hate Sean Rocker," by AirSick Productions.  The show concludes abruptly during the introduction of the "Bit of the Week," focusing on a newspaper photo of Ricky Martin with a male companion on a beach, before the bit is fully revealed.  Throughout the entire broadcast, profanity, crude humor, and offensive language are frequent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony, you're not a jackass, you're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027 WNEW.  Hi, NEW.  Talking about cock, cocktails or whatever.  You know what I'm saying?  Hello?  Excuse me.  Yeah, what can I do for you?  Yeah, what you could do for me is turn that crap off.  I have kids here in the house.  You started drinking a little early this Friday, man.  Listen, buddy, what I do in my own private time is my business, okay? 
[00:00:30]  She's worrying about the children.  She's sauced.  Listen.  Listen to me.  Hold on a second.  Shut up over there.  Hey, could you put the teeth back in your mouth so we can understand you?  You find that very funny, to pick on me, huh?  To pick on me.  Yeah.  What I want you to do is take that crap off the radio.  Blah, blah, blah.  You poopy face, okay?  Well, she showed you, Opie.  Blah, blah, blah, what an ingenious name, radio name. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know what?  You, you smell.  You look good.  I know.  You, you're an asshole.  Might I add, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.  Listen to me very carefully.  If you don't take that music off, and I'm not kidding with you, I'm going to come down  there, and I don't know what I'm going to do.  And I'll wait outside the radio station.  Where's your address?  You can't even walk straight.  You're drunk.  You ain't going nowhere.  Stop it.  The foster home should have your kids. 
[00:01:30]  You're a mess.  You better leave me alone.  Listen to you.  I'm going to feed my kids because of you now.  Your kids.  Because of you, cock-a-face.  Those poor kids.  I love my children with all my heart, and I can't have them living to this.  Well, when you find them, give them a kiss.  They're probably lost in your pigsty house that you're probably around.  So it's funny to make fun of me because I'm poor now.  See, make fun of me because I'm a woman.  Because I have, I don't like my kids living.  If you live in a frigid air box, it's probably clean.  Oh, make fun of me, don't you? 
[00:02:00]  Make fun of me.  I'm going to send my girlfriend down there to kick her ass.  What are you thinking of?  You're a mess.  I hate you.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change the station? 
[00:02:30]  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  O.P. and Anthony.  We've just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  1027.  WNEW.  We can talk about O.J. real fast.  Yeah, O.J. back in the mirrors, huh?  With a 911 call.  Let's check out the 911 call.  All right.  Hey, Gary, police and fire. 
[00:03:00]  Where's your emergency?  We have a problem here.  I'm trying to get a girl to go to rehab in Northbrook.  With pay for a girl.  Does anybody there need rescue?  We've been doing drugs for two days with pay for a girl, though.  We just got arrested.  Okay.  With my cocaine.  And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  No, no, no.  You got to go.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does the girl be in the rescue?  No.  That's my favorite.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not this time. 
[00:03:30]  Not this time.  She had to ask if anyone was getting hit or hurt or if he has weapons.  Does the woman have another mouth under her mouth now that's really bloody?  No, not this time.  I got to hear that again.  That's it.  Okay.  And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  No, no, no.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does the girl need to rescue?  No, she doesn't need a rifle.  I don't want her to help her.  I'm trying to tell her. 
[00:04:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now, don't get started on that again.  No, no.  No weapons.  That's in the golf bag.  I mean, I don't know where tonight is it.  That's in a lake in Chicago.  Don't make me get on a plane.  Oh, I cut my knuckle on the nine when I was dialing 911.  That's where the blood's from.  I swear.  Where's Robert Kardashian?  Help me, please.  He's like, no.  What at all?  No, no, no.  Don't think that.  No, no.  Someone who I heard need rescue? 
[00:04:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I love it.  Don't make me get the Bronco.  Now, what is he doing?  Does he call 911 back?  Oh, no.  911 calls his home, I believe.  I guess they were disconnected or something.  And then 911 usually calls back.  Okay.  So here's the second hand.  Hello, OJ House.  Oh, boy.  Hang out.  I want you to call the police.  Hello?  Okay. 
[00:05:00]  This is the deuce.  Now, what happened?  I don't know.  You hear OJ going, I want you to call the police.  I had to hit her over the head with the phone receiver.  I'm just disconnected.  I like him.  Hello?  This is the police department.  Oh, she left, and I don't know what to do about it.  Man, she's frustrated.  She, this guy, Pedro Guerrero, got low, got arrested for having 15 keys of cocaine here.  This girl has spent the last two days doing drugs with him.  Man, a friend just came over to say, you're going into a rehab. 
[00:05:30]  She got mad.  She just got her car.  She drives a Mercedes.  She lives in the car.  Now, she is loaded out of her mind in her Mustang driving around town.  What other girl is that?  I have a license number, but she needs to be stopped.  What other is the Mustang?  It's white.  It's white.  Like a Bronco.  You got some white.  She's a white girl.  Okay, thank you.  I got to go and see if I can find her.  Okay.  That's all I need, a white girl. 
[00:06:00]  This has got to be a comedy routine.  I believe Al Cowling's driving.  O.J. calls 9-1-1.  Is O.J. putting out a prank call tape?  Is that what's going on here?  The best of O.J.  I call 9-1-1 around the country.  Get my 9-1-1 comedy tape.  O.J. calls 9-1-1.  Hello, 9-1-1?  9-1-1 operator.  Is the refrigerator running there?  Yes, it is. 
[00:06:30]  Well, you better take it.  9-1-1?  9-1-1, what's your emergency?  Hello, do you have Prince Albert in a camp?  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in a camp?  Yes, we do.  Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.  That's the O.J. Simpson 9-1-1 comedy tape.  Only yours now. 
[00:07:00]  He's a big old man.  Hello, is this 9-1-1?  Yes.  Do you have 10-pound balls?  Yes, we do.  How do you walk?  You'll skip a bunch of O.J. Simpson.  I gotta go now.  I gotta find her.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh?  Oh, man. 
[00:07:30]  I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug.  I'm trying to call that.  Hello, 9-1-1?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike.  Master Long with your favorite murderer, O.J.  9-1-1?  Yes.  Uh, butt plug. 
[00:08:00]  Bug box?  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother...  Does O.J. do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape?  Kind of like the jerky voices?  I'll come down there with my toolbox. 
[00:08:30]  I'll bash your head in with a ratchet.  Oh, nice.  I'm O.J.  Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I better fly to Chicago.  Oh, man.  That's the O.J. Simpson 9-1-1 comedy tape.  All of yours now.  Friggin' O.J., man.  He's back.  I love him.  Thank God.

[00:12:30]  And it's FU Friday  Hello, hello, hello  Hey, man  What's going on, Anthony?  What's happening?  Not much  Not much at all  Yeah  I only had about 100 messages on my machine when I got home last night  Yeah  My brother  My brother, it was hilarious  Brett was  He felt so, so bad for us  He goes  Because if anyone's like a fan of your show  Yeah  Our show, obviously  They would know how much  Before yesterday 
[00:13:00]  We looked up to The Rock  Kind of liked The Rock  Yeah  Even though we're in our 30s  He's like a superhero in our eyes  You know, we really, really enjoyed  Very entertaining to watch  You know  A fan  What he did for the WWF  Yeah  And, you know  We admired the guy and all that  And  Wow  And then just to  Just to have what happened yesterday to us  That's what my brother felt  Worse about  Than anything that actually went on  On the show  Oh, yeah  Yeah  That was a little  A little rough yesterday 
[00:13:30]  Because it was kind of like seeing Superman  Without his cape  And no one wants to see that ever  I don't know  You know, after mulling it over  For a night  Thinking about it  It kind of  Like pisses me off a little bit  Without a doubt  I've lost all respect for The Rock  And I could care less  What he does in the WWF  From this moment on  Yeah  It's like  I don't know  I don't think that was necessary  I think he could have gotten  More of his facts straight  I think he made up his mind  And walked 
[00:14:00]  Without really knowing  What the real deal was  Right  You know  Well, I guess we're going to play  The uncomfortable  Oh, are we?  The uncomfortable part of the interview  Oh, no  Just because  I mean  The response on it  Is just unbelievable  We're going to do it a little later though  Because Lewis Black's coming in here at 3.30  Oh, no  Later on in the show  We'll definitely rehash the whole thing  But you know what  I mean  My blood today  Is absolutely boiling  It really is  Because, you know 
[00:14:30]  We were blindsided  I swear to you  And I said it right to his face  Man to man  I had no  Freaking  Idea  What he was saying  Yeah  And that is the God's honest truth  And he was expecting us to, you know  Just trash Sick Boy in front of his face  We didn't have any of the facts at the time  Or anything  Let me tell you something  About my side of this whole thing  I visit Sick Boy's site a lot  The X Wrestling  And I've seen what's on the site 
[00:15:00]  You know what it is?  It's satire  It's comedic writing  It's funny  It's not  And it is really politically incorrect  I mean  Talk about goofing on everybody  I mean everything  You could go there  And see the writers on that site  Goofing on gays  Jews  Blacks  Everybody  Italians  Doesn't matter  That's what that site is like  Is about 
[00:15:30]  Now  On the other hand  Like he said  Or asked  No we don't have anything to do with the site  I enjoy going there  Like I enjoy going to thousands of websites  But  I don't think he understands  That that's what that site is about  And we didn't have anything to do with it  But that doesn't even matter  At this point  Sick Boy is a guest on our show  As was The Rock  As was Jeffrey Ross that day  You know we don't screen our guests  To see who they're either affiliated with 
[00:16:00]  Or what businesses they own  Or anything  Yeah  They come on our show  If they do good radio  If we like them  They will return  That's it  And I did some research on Jeffrey Ross  I didn't know he was a kid toucher  Oh my god  You know if I knew he was a kid toucher  We wouldn't have him in yesterday  Oh my god  I hope that is absolutely false  I don't even know what you're talking about  Jeffrey I'm just kidding  My god  Just kidding Mr. Ross  But yeah  Sick Boy guest on our show 
[00:16:30]  Right  Just like a bunch of other guests  That we've ever had in the past  Right  That's all  Right  No biggie rock  He didn't have to freak out like that  I understand it's a touchy issue with him  And I don't care how blown up he is  And how big he is  Because he is absolutely huge  Not today because he's not here  Well no  No  But he truly in my eyes  He's not even a man  And I'll tell you why  Because after the segment was over  And we went into commercials  And I told him what I knew about the situation 
[00:17:00]  And explained his point of view  Yeah  Any other man  Would at least stick around  And maybe discuss it for five minutes  Maybe  You know what I'm saying  But what did this big huge mother effort do  He just turns around and walks right out  Without even giving us a chance to discuss this further  I'm not going to lay into him  Because  I don't give a crap man  You know what  I am so freaking pissed today  Let me tell you why  Why  Because it seems like you're being a pussy  If you're talking like that 
[00:17:30]  When he's not sitting here  So I'm not going to do that  No  I'll give him the form to come back today Anthony  He's in the area okay  Yeah  It proves I'm not a pussy  Alright  If the rock wants to come in today  And we'll discuss this further  Fine  Alright  That proves I'm not a pussy  I know he's still in town  He's doing another book signing tomorrow  Right  Or today I don't know  Cool  So if he wants to call in that's great too  But he's not even a man in my eyes  Because he wouldn't discuss it further after  We left the radio show  After the commercials 
[00:18:00]  They all just ran out of here  They did just  And I am  That is what I am pissed off about  And if he really wants to get on this racism  Soapbox of his  Okay  Why doesn't he look within the company he works for  And by saying that  I am totally for what the WWF does  Right  Okay  But if he really is that concerned  You know  He makes a pretty good living  From a company  That  That exploits 
[00:18:30]  Stereotypes  Let's face it  Sure  And I have no problem with that  No problem whatsoever  It's entertaining  We exploit stereotypes on this radio show  It's funny  It is funny  And like it's funny when you watch it on WWF  And you see The Godfather come out  And he's dressed like a pimp  And he's pimping hoes  And smoking weed  You know  I mean come on  That's not a stereotype  I hear on The Rock's website  He has a whole section on  Trail Apart Trash 
[00:19:00]  Yeah  Some people would find that very offensive  Rock  Right  I don't know  But I swear to God  I am so freaking pissed today  And right after the show  One of the representatives from the WWF  You know  Left me a voicemail  And I called her right back  Because I was still like  What the hell  I'll discuss this  You know  Yeah  But I don't even want to discuss it anymore  But I got her on the phone  And she goes  We heard  The rest of the show  After we left  And we're not pleased whatsoever  Not pleased whatsoever 
[00:19:30]  And then she was convinced that  We like  Controlled the phone calls  And just made  You know  So the people that were on  Would agree with what we were saying  That's not what we did whatsoever  There were plenty of calls of people that  Say you know  We acted wrong  Or we looked stupid  Or  You know  We were the a-holes  We put those through too  What do you think  We censor the calls  No  And it's too bad  Because we do have a good relationship 
[00:20:00]  With the WWF  But I could care less about The Rock now  Yeah  Hmm  What a  Steve from the unofficial website  Who was in the studio yesterday  Steve what's going on  What's up fellas  Hey  I liked your posting on the unofficial website today  About this whole thing  Yeah  You know  I got home last night  Talked to Sick for a couple minutes  And needless to say  He was a little shocked  You know  Still about the whole thing  I know he hung with you guys for a while  Personally  I went out afterwards and got drunk 
[00:20:30]  I went home and went right for the wine  Yeah  Big bottle of red  Yeah that was a little stressful  To be perfectly honest  But you know something  In retrospect  That guy  Had he known about it  Which it certainly sounds like he did  He should have said something  Very obviously  He should have said something to you guys about it  And he didn't handle himself very well  And any amount of apologizing  Wasn't going to change his mind  And that's what sucked about it  Well that's fine  Then why don't we discuss it off air 
[00:21:00]  Why don't you be a man and call us today  Yeah exactly  Because I told him the truth  I had no freaking idea about this  I mean he lumbered out of there  Like a 280 pound crybaby  I mean  For lack of a better analogy  But  Corky rock  Yeah exactly  Exactly  I mean and how many racial stereotypes  Has this guy used in his wrestling matches  Personally I don't know  I'm not a huge  Well I mean  I could give you all sorts of info on that  But it's whatever  I mean if he really wants to get into this issue 
[00:21:30]  He should look right where he's working  Yeah  Exactly  Exactly  You know why he never will though?  Why?  Because he makes way too much money  Oh exactly  I mean it's political to a very large extent  And then he can look like he cares about those issues  By bashing some guy's website or a radio show  Of course  Of course  And you know the fact that he made some blind assessment  About the whole situation  Hadn't seen the post himself  You know he was going by what people told him  Now you know 
[00:22:00]  You know and I'm sure  I'm sure there were racially insensitive things  That were said on it  You know because that's what  Sick said after looking at it  But he erased it immediately  The fact that he persisted  In having a temper tantrum about it  After he was apologized to up and down  You know what  Sick boy shouldn't even have to erase it  What happened to freedom of speech in this country?  Yeah  Slowly diminishing  Especially on the internet  You may not like what you read  That's fine 
[00:22:30]  You know  I always thought the internet might  You know earlier  In the early days of the internet  Back in the early to mid 90s  You know  I thought that would end up being  Like the last bastion of free speech  Yeah  You know what I mean  Like because you'd go on there  And just  Man it didn't matter  Sometimes you'd punch up something  Read it and just  Be offended yourself  But just the fact that it was there  I mean it's an open forum  It shouldn't be controlled  It's  It's first amendment man  That lasted for all of five minutes  And then someone figured out 
[00:23:00]  They could make some money  Suing somebody  Right  Complaining about it  And making a couple thousand lawyers rich  Yeah  And you know  You do anything successful on the internet  And you're going to get fleeced  It's ridiculous  It really is  And the fact that he even had to  I mean  Removing stuff from websites  Because some people find it offensive  I mean what's next  For Christ's sake  And then like  Guilty by  I hate this guilty by association  So now  Okay  Obviously you have a problem 
[00:23:30]  With what Sick Boy did  So now you instantly hate us  Because he's in the studio  Wait not Sick Boy  No  A writer on his site  It wasn't even Sick Boy  That posted that  Alright so it's a writer  On Sick Boy's site  So then immediately  Somehow  He should hate us as well  Right  Exactly  Well whatever  That makes a lot of sense  Why don't you start doing  Some background checks  On all the people  That are around you  Rock  You might be very surprised  Well you know  Again he had all of  The previous evening  To be briefed about this  And didn't do any more research 
[00:24:00]  Other than  Whatever information  They gave him  You know  And then just walked in here  And didn't mention it beforehand  Until he was introduced  To Sick  You know  Right  And that wasn't cool  Right  That wasn't cool  And he didn't handle himself  Very well  Poor form on his part  Well  You know  If he didn't want to  Get into it on the air  Well you know  We did go right to commercials  Yeah  And then he even looked at him  Like you know  Like hey  I was like hey  You know  I wanted to see if  He was going to shake my hand  Or something  But he just turned around 
[00:24:30]  And walked out  He just kind of gave me  That look  And turned around  And walked out  It's like man  You know  And that kind of  Pisses me off  Because  You know what  You're looking at me  Like  Sorry I cursed  Looking at me  Like I'm Mr. F'n KKK  Or something  Yeah I know  You know  That pisses me off  It's  It was a temper tantrum  It was a temper tantrum  You know  However you want to look at it  But you know  It's  You know  You broke my toys  I don't want to play with you anymore  Yeah  You know  And that's childish 
[00:25:00]  That's childish  And it's a shame  It had to happen live  And that the guy  Couldn't handle himself  A little bit better  Well I don't mind  I don't mind that it happened live  It was  It was  Interesting radio  To say the least  I mean no one turned off  Their radio yesterday  I'm  Quite sure that's the case  I don't  I don't enjoy being in those  Situations  But it makes for a good  A good listen  When you're in your car  No  That was definitely  The most awkward silence  I have ever been a part of  Yeah  And then you're trying to think  As quick as possible 
[00:25:30]  To come up with  You know  Something  Yeah exactly  But I was just so shocked  Because this came out of left field  And my  I mean my famous line  What happened  I thought we were all  Just having fun here  Exactly  Yeah  And then poof  You know  You're total deer in the headlights  Right  Oh my god  I just got hit  Right  And it had nothing to do with it  You were on the Opie and Anthony show  You weren't on the sick boy show  You weren't on a  A wrestler  A wrestling site show  Or  You know what I mean  You were on our show  And  God damn it 
[00:26:00]  We had nothing to do with it  And that's what sucks  About the whole situation  Is that the guy didn't want to listen  Right  The guy didn't want to be apologized to  He wanted to have his temper tantrum  And  I looked at him right in the eye  I said  Dude  I had no freaking idea  No idea  So  Didn't seem that there was much  Getting through to this guy  But a good posting on your  Unofficial website about it  Very good Steve  No problem  And the truth of the matter is  Even if  We did have an idea  Of what was on that site  It still doesn't matter 
[00:26:30]  Right  It still doesn't matter  No  It doesn't  Because you read something offensive  On a website  Then you're responsible for it  Or you should have to  Be held accountable for it  Please  Well I mean  Unfortunately  There is some degree of responsibility  One must take  When  When you go into this thing  I mean  You know  Understandably  Sick didn't write it  But  You know  It's like if  If one of the writers  On the unofficial site  And they're all great guys  You know  Frank  Joe 
[00:27:00]  Josh  If one of them  All of a sudden  Started spewing forth  Racially incentive  Remarks  People are going to  Start looking at me  Right  And asking me  Why the F  Are you letting this guy  Write for this site  And then he wanted us  To pretty much  Sell Sick Boy  Down the river  We're not going to do that  No  We're not going to do that  To anyone that  Helps out our radio show  Especially before  We get all the facts  And then look into it  If you've been to the site  It is satire  Yeah  It is politically  Incorrect  Satire 
[00:27:30]  And commentary  On wrestling  And other stuff  That goes on  In the world  And on the top  Of that very post  The guy even wrote  The author even wrote  This is a mock  This is not real  This is  Not to be taken seriously  By whoever's reading it  Was it distasteful  Yeah  Was it politically  Incorrect  Yeah  I mean but  You know something  So what  It was a little comedic thing  That he threw together  And why can't you put  Racial stereotypes  In comedy 
[00:28:00]  And not be lambasted  For it  If The Rock doesn't  Agree with it  Fine  He doesn't have to read it  But then what's he  Going to just  Disassociate himself  With anyone who's  Even read the site  Well  It's ridiculous  I didn't even read the site  Yeah  I hope he didn't even read it  That's what blows me away  He has every right  To be pissed off  But he's attacking  The wrong people  First of all  He walked off our show  It's interesting  When you look at  Racial stereotypes  And some comics  Do get away with it  Some comics don't  Yeah  The ones that do 
[00:28:30]  That Apollo theater show  Oh yeah  And let's make it clear  I mean we stereotype  On the show  Definitely  Oh hell yeah  So  Because that's  A part of comedy  It has been  For many many years  So wasn't the rock  Part of the  Nation of domination  Remember that  I remember that  He had that  And the guy  Is the godfather now  Was in there  And D-Lo  And they were  It was like  A white  Hating  Black supremacist group  Why is it okay 
[00:29:00]  In that regard  Yeah  I mean rock  Was part of that  He got in a battle  With DX  And they all  Got in blackface  Went into the ring  And started imitating  The nation of domination  Yeah  In blackface  Doing like  Stereotypical black lingo  And walking  And talking  The rock was drawing  A paycheck on that  So I guess  He didn't  That didn't upset him  That much  The more I think about it  The more hypocritical  This guy seems  Yeah  With like 24 hours  Or so to mull this over 
[00:29:30]  It's like  Wow man  It's leaving a bad taste  In my mouth  Exactly  Well you know  At the time  You're stunned  You feel like  You just got hit  Upside the head  With a baseball bat  It's hard to  It's hard to think  Of all this stuff  And you know what  We don't want to  Sound like pussies today  You know  I'm going to say it again  If the rock  Wants to discuss this further  We're here  I'll do it face to face  I don't care  It's a very smart thing  To say  No it's the truth though  And he's still in the area  It's not like  He had to fly anywhere else  He's doing another  Book signing somewhere today  I know where  But I'm not going to  Give him any more publicity 
[00:30:00]  Screw him  Sure  He's not a man  He didn't want to  Discuss this off mic  Screw you  Jackass  Man to man  I told you  I had no freaking clue  And like a baby  You had to walk off the show  Well look  If you want the full story  Check out the little snippet  I wrote  On the foundrymusic.com site  Alright  Well we're going to  If we have time  We're definitely going to  You know  Replay the uncomfortable moment  From this day  If you do  I'll call sick  And try to make sure  He's not listening 
[00:30:30]  Honestly  Rick was listening to it  In the office  I couldn't even listen  I was like  Turn it off  He kind of made us  Look kind of stupid  Yeah you know  You know  It's just uncomfortable  It's awkward silence  It's  You know  It's a lot of people  Going uh  Um  Uh  Right  Yeah well you're trying to  You know  Get your thoughts together  As the mics are on  You know  Yeah exactly  And then you're blindsided  Like that  Of course  And then you quickly realize  You know  You can't say anything  This guy's not going to  Listen to anything  Right  Exactly  Alright  What were you going to 
[00:31:00]  Do about it  Nothing  There you go  Well thank you Steve  Not a problem  Alright  Talk to you soon  You got  Bye  Bye  How pompous  Huh  How pompous too  They'll walk in here  What do people think  Uh  He thinks people want to  Hear Dwayne Johnson  They want to hear The Rock  Uh Dave  What's up O&A  How are you  I think I got uh  I came to a conclusion  Why The Rock  Kind of flipped out  On you guys  Yeah  Well  Cause I taped it  For my friend 
[00:31:30]  And uh  I kind of went back to it  And I listened to it  And you know  When uh  When Sick Boy  Asked that question  Right  On The Rock  And The Rock  Said before I answer that  I got some questions  About your website  Yeah  And all you guys  Were like  You know  Oh no  You know  Kind of like  Saying like  You know  Oh no  He's in trouble now  Kind of thing  Yeah  Well just  Just because we  Yeah  But we had no idea  He was bringing up that  You know what  Like if I was The Rock  I'd probably think to myself  I'd go  Oh they probably know  What's on the site  Cause they're saying that  Uh no  You know  And they're probably  He's probably thinking  Oh yeah 
[00:32:00]  These guys are in it too  It was more than  Them you know  We know Sick Boy  Has an edge to him  That's all I was thinking  When we had that reaction  Well I still think  It's kind of  Dick On The Rock's  You know  Side  Yeah  He's  He's a hypocrite  Alright man  Okay man  Thanks Dave  You guys are great  Alright  Later  Bye  James what's going on  Hey open ad  It's Jamie the bus driver  Listen man  I was dying to get in  Last night  To call  It was too late  And this has been  It's been on my mind  Just as it's been on yours  And I'm not even part of the show  First of all 
[00:32:30]  I want to say  I'm not a racist  I'm an Italian guy  I'm married to a Puerto Rican  We have kids  Okay but  The Rock was way off  Number one  I mean he should no way  Have laid into you guys  By any way shape or form  That's number one  Number two  This is not a political forum show  You know what I'm saying  It's a comedy show  And whatever stuff  That's written on that page  Like you said  He kind of stole my thunder  About the satire  And stuff like that  It's satire  It's all as a joke  You know  And it pissed me off  To listen to him  Get all  You know 
[00:33:00]  Get all twisted  I bet you he laughed  His ass off  While Chris Rock  Was calling the Backstreet Boys  Crackers with attitude  Right  You know what I'm saying  Or whenever he listened  To Richard Pryor  Or Eddie Murphy  Joke about Asian people  Or watching the Godfather  Do one of his skits  Yeah there you go  Come on  Let's face it  There's no way  You know  There's no way  He could have took that stance  He had other issues  That dude  And by him taking it out  On you guys  Was wrong  You know  I got a little bone 
[00:33:30]  To pick though  You know  It seemed like  You guys did  A little bit  Of backpedaling  You know  I mean  You should have stood  You know  I thought maybe  You should have stood  A little firm  And saying  Yo dude  James  We didn't read the site  We didn't know  We were on it  But it's a joke  James you'll hear  For yourself  We didn't backpedal  I think what you hear  I didn't  You know  I mean  When you hear the tape again  Maybe later on  If we have time  Is that we were just  In complete shock  It was an ambush  No doubt  You know  It was definitely an ambush  Because we were really  Having a good time with him  Yeah I know 
[00:34:00]  I was enjoying it  And I was on the road  Enjoying it  You know  We were hoping  He was going to be  More of the rock  Because honestly  I mean  He has really nothing to say  As Dwayne Johnson  Yeah I agree  What the hell is he going to say  As Dwayne Johnson  I agree  Yo guys  I'm in defense of you  All the way  You've got a great show  It's a funny show  And people listening  From WWF  Right  If you're listening in  It's a comedy show people  Wake up  Alright  Thank you James  Okay  Alright bye  One more  And we'll take a break here  John what do you have  Hey guys  How you doing  Alright  Alright  Listen  I've been listening to you guys

Hey what's up guys  How you doing?  Real good  Hey you know  You got sold up  The river this morning  On another morning show  What do you mean?  The Rock did an interview  On um  Can I mention the station?  Yeah I don't care  On um PLJ  And they were asking him  About what gets to him  Like what annoys him  About people in society  And his role 
[00:36:30]  And everything  And he um  Pretty much said  Racial issues  Oh yeah  And then had a big um  Five minute dissertation  On how yesterday  He was forced to walk out  Of an interview  Before he did something  He would have regretted  Ah  He would have regretted  Uh  Wow  He was like ready to  Ready to throw some punches  That's the way he made it sound  Oh great  But we were sitting here  At work  And we were laughing at it  Because we knew  What happened yesterday  With you guys  Yeah  And then hearing him  This morning  It's like  Sorry  Talk about Two-Face  Did uh 
[00:37:00]  Scott and Todd  Have the balls  To mention our names  Because they do  Listen to us every day  Not at all  They didn't say anything  But you could tell  They knew who they  Of course they knew  Everyone was listening  To it yesterday  Oh my god  Bunch of pussies  So  He had to walk out  Yep  Before he did something  He regretted  Oh  That's good  Now I can see  Where the rage problem is  Yeah really  They say he has a rage problem  Well that's obvious  Good figure that out  Huh  Must be a treat  Alright  Thanks guys  You the best 
[00:37:30]  Thanks Jim  Later  Bye  Dealing with that  Uh  Who's this  Hey this is Rev Tobey  I'm a writer for  Xwrestling.com  What's this  I've seen some of your posts  Firstly I just want to  Thank you guys  For supporting the site  And supporting Sick Boy  Because I'm sure  This has gotten you  A lot of bad PR  That's okay  We're used to that  And I mean  It's just  It's ridiculous  I think  I read somewhere  That this is  In the first chapter  Of his book  Yeah  He mentioned that  He's all against racism  And everything like that 
[00:38:00]  And I think this is  Kind of like a PR move  Oh you think  In my opinion  Well I mean  It's like  If he knew about this  He should have mentioned it  Before he came in the studio  Or when he  Or when he was  You know like  Working it out  To you know  Come in  Well if he would have  Looked at the  The post  That he said  He did look at  And he would have  Saw like it was  A mock interview  With Opie and Anthony  He could have  Yes asked us  About it beforehand  Right  I mean it's just  That he brought it up  I think he needed to  You know get his  Little 50 minute 
[00:38:30]  Plug in first  Exactly yeah  And I mean like  This gives him  Great PR for his book  Which by the way  The critics hate  Because it wasn't  Written by him  It was written by  A ghost writer  But that's  Another story  Yeah I mean  The rock doesn't  Have time to write  Yeah I mean  I'm too busy  Freeing the world  From racism  Awesome I mean  You know like  SIGWA gives us  Free  You know free enterprise  To write  You know what we want  Well it's the internet  Yeah I mean  It's not regulated  Like that 
[00:39:00]  You guys should have  Free enterprise  You know I may not  Agree with everything  I read on the internet  But you guys should  Have the right to  Write whatever the hell  You want  Write what you want  Man  Before they regulate  That crap too  And you know something  The rock has a right  To read it  Be offended  And not want to  Speak to a sick boy  That's fine too  And we have the right  To post whatever  You know we want as well  This was written by  A guy in California  Who I've never met  Who sick boys never met  And you know  It's  The really strange thing  Was I was talking  To him on a  On a 
[00:39:30]  AOL  While this whole thing  Was happening  Yeah  He's like  How's the interview going  And I'm like  Well  It just took a turn  Yeah  And then he's like  What happened  What happened  And I'm like  Well you know  The rock got all pissed off  And he's like  Why  I'm like  Well  Because of your article dude  And he's like  Gosh  You know  I can't believe that  And everything  And sick boy came back  And he  He was actually  Contemplating closing the site  Yeah  In fact this is still  You know  Under debate  Right  Like we should close the site  Now that would be silly  Yeah I know  I'm trying to  We're all trying to  Get him to you know 
[00:40:00]  Reconsider that  And we've gotten  Tons of  Support email  Cool  It's all flowing in  So hopefully everything  Will be okay  And hey  We got more hits yesterday  Than we ever got  I bet  I mean you know  No good publicity  You know  All right  Well thank you  Sure no problem  How you doing man  Dave what's going on  Hey Dave  Yeah what's up  How are you  Hey man  Pretty good man  Good  This is like  The biggest story  On the internet right now  Like this guy  Dave Meltzer  He's even reporting 
[00:40:30]  That it's part of an angle  That you guys took place in  That's ridiculous  Oh my god  That everyone should be skeptical  That you guys are  That the WWF  Is trying to play off  The John Rocker comments  And have the Rock  Do something like that  All right  Well I  You know what  I have to say this  We had no idea  This was going to happen  And you can believe that  Or not  But we had no clue  No freaking clue  Yeah and like  Going off with  And you mentioned  John Rocker  Let me tell you something  About John Rocker  You know what 
[00:41:00]  I was kind of offended  By everything he said  Okay  Or most of the stuff  That he said  All right  And it makes me want  To take a decel  To his head  Next time he's at Shea  Without a doubt  But you know what  He has the right  To say those things  Yeah  People are so willing  To give up their rights  To free speech  In this country  It amazes me  They go  Oh he should be fired  He has to go  To a psychiatrist  Good  That guy's a nut  What's he saying  All of a sudden  You're throwing away  Your rights to free speech  They're throwing them away 
[00:41:30]  Someday someone might not  Like what you're saying  Think you should go  To a shrink  And you know  I hate John Rocker  Hate him  Hate him  Hate him  Hate him  Hate him  Hate him  But if I was him  I would say  I'm not going to get  That psychological  Go to a shrink  No I'm not going  To a shrink  You don't want me  Pitching in your league  Oh well  But I'm not going  To a shrink  Yeah and John Rocker  Is actually an employee  Of Turner  Which owns WCW  So you know  They're racist too  So there you go  But just like  Everyone's a bunch 
[00:42:00]  Of hypocrites  Yep  Everybody  Hypocrisy all over  This damn country  Of ours  I like everything  Being available  To adults  In this country  That's it  I'm saying like  Everything  It should be  On the internet  The internet  Should not be  Regulated whatsoever  Anything should be  Able to be printed  On  When they say  Oh you shouldn't  Have racial comments  Or this website  Has got to be  Shut down  Because it's  Against this group  Or that one  Or you shouldn't  Even  You know 
[00:42:30]  Have plans  For friggin  Nuclear weapons  I don't care  Everything  If it's out there  It should be  Available to everybody  Yeah that's why  I even told him  He shouldn't  Shut down the site  I told him  We can even  Get a slogan  Out of it  By saying  X-Wrestling  The site  The Rock reads  You know  Just like  Maybe stick it to  The Rock reads  You guys should  Even put the  Posting back up  Yeah  I swear to God  Just put it back up  Yeah exactly  Alright thanks a lot  Guys  Yeah man  Personally I've seen  Funnier stuff  From that site  It was kind of stupid 
[00:43:00]  But you guys have  The right to type that  I gotta tell you  That Macbeth man  He's one funny  Son of a bitch  Yeah that guy  Who wrote the post  I was talking to him  As well when it was  Going down  Right  He didn't even care  That he was getting  In trouble  He was just making  Sure that you guys  Were alright  Like he didn't want  Anything bad  To happen to you guys  This is on the  Trouble meter  For the Opie and Anthony  Show  This doesn't even  Like raise the  Yellow light yet  Nothing  Believe me  We've been in  Much bigger trouble  Than this  Alright Dave  Alright thanks a lot 
[00:43:30]  Guys  Thank you  Alright  Bye  Dennis you're next  What's going on  Hey guys  I think you guys  Were being totally  Duped by The Rock  I think what he did  Was he knew his time  Was almost up  For the interview  What better way  To get him  To get people  To still talk about  Him after he's gone  To create some  Controversy  And this is what  He talked about  With his publicist  For two hours  The night before  And that's why  He dropped the bomb  On you guys  Near the end  Of the interview  It was eight minutes  To six  When he did it  Because I looked  At the clock  Because I think 
[00:44:00]  The world stopped  At that time  Once he blew that up  And I was thinking  Well you know what  His publicist  Is really shrewd  Because it's  The perfect time  To do it  Well you know  If that's what  They planned  It worked  Brilliant  Congratulations  Great job  At our expense  Good job  Great job  Well you know  What the good thing is  I think most of us  Listeners are more educated  Than The Rock  Himself  So we know better  He's not a man  Alright guys  You guys are great  Keep it up  Alright  Bye  Alright  Not a man  Any man would have 
[00:44:30]  Discussed it further  After we went off the air  Rob what's up  What's going on guys  Alright  I just got to say  Above all else  I mean you know  What The Rock did  It's just bad for business  I mean if there's  Anyone out there  Giving plugs to the WWF  And making them look good  And you know  You guys have the audience  You have the audience  At the palm of your hand  Every day  We have given  The biggest support  In the New York market  No one  I mean half the jocks  On the radio  Have no clue  About the WWF  I know  And it's like  Now he goes  And with everything 
[00:45:00]  That occurred  What are you going to say  You haven't just given  People a chance  To talk about it  You give the WWF  Segments on your show  Yeah  You know  Oh yeah  So  You just watch  I mean after today  You watch out  How many times  We mention the WWF  In the future  I know  And what are those  Comments going to be  I mean  You had nothing but praise  In the beginning  And now  It's just  Nah there's plenty  Of other things  To talk about  Yeah  I mean if you're  Going to be a smart  Businessman  Above all else  You got to  You know  You got to look  To the people  That help you out  And that was his  Biggest mistake  Above all else  Was to make himself  Look bad 
[00:45:30]  And you know  Into your eyes  Right  Yeah  Alright Rob  That's all I got to say  Take care  Thank you  Bye  Bye  Tom what's going on  Hey  We're going to see  The Rock right now  At a book signing  Yeah  Yeah we're going to  Give him a little  Piece of our mind  You better watch out  You better watch out  He has a rage problem  Rage problem  Yeah I don't know  I think I might have to  Give him the rock bottom  Myself  Is that that  And he's in my hometown  I was going to say  Is that  God  Is that that book  Still right by  Your house

[00:52:00]  I guess get naked for Lewis  Very good  Cool  So we'll have to wait for Lewis to get here  To do that right?  Yeah  Alright  We got Rosie Perez  Involved in one of those  Meaningless arrests  Yeah  I love when these celebrities get arrested  Yeah  We've talked about that  For their causes  In the past  Who else has been arrested in this town?  I know Reverend Al  Every other week  Is getting arrested somewhere  But it's not a real arrest  Susan Sarandon  Yeah  Is really into that  Bill Cosby  Bill Cosby  Is getting arrested 
[00:52:30]  Likes doing that  Now Rosie  For  What was it for?  To stop nuclear testing  In Puerto Rico?  Well honestly  It's a big issue though  Is it?  Yeah  The people of Puerto Rico  Are really pissed off  It's like  What  There's a small island  Off the coast  Or something  What are we blowing up?  And we're doing nuclear testing?  Yeah  How do you feel about that Rick?  Being a Puerto Rican gentleman  I don't really care  You don't?  I could give a crap  It's a small island  They've been doing it for years  We basically own them anyway 
[00:53:00]  Right?  Well that's  That's what they say  What are we blowing up?  Well we can't blow up bombs  I guess we're just testing  Some kind of nuclear stuff  Yeah  Oops  It's a pretty huge issue  To the Puerto Rican community  Anthony  Funny  It's like a real small island  It's like  Okay  No no  It's on this side  So it's okay  Yeah  You know damn well  It's probably affecting them  It's  Nice to see Rosie Perez  Actually can get arrested 
[00:53:30]  In this town  More publicity than she's had  In the last what?  I know  Seven years  She wasn't hanging with Puffy either  Alright listen  I gotta cut you guys off  Because Joe Lyons  Just arrived with Louis Black  Oh Louis  He's a very busy  And popular man  Oh he's not here yet  No  Was that just Joe?  Just Joe  Just Joe  What is Joe gonna add to our show  From Comedy Central?  I don't know  Did he hear the rock show?  Like everyone else  Alright well  What we have to do anyway 
[00:54:00]  Is take another break  Because we spent so much time  On the rock  Wow we just took one  I know  We're running late  So what we'll do  Is we'll do the F lesson  Okay  Very popular bit on Friday  And then we'll be back  Hopefully with Louis Black  Stay there  Perhaps one of the most interesting words  In the English language today  Is the word  Out of all of the English words  That begin with the letter F 
[00:54:30]  Is the only word that is referred to  As the F word  It's the one magical word  Just by its sound  Can describe pain  Pleasure  Hate  And love  F  As most words  In the English language  Is derived from German  The word  Flicken  Which means to strike  In English  F  Falls into many  Grammatical categories  As a transitive verb  For instance  John  F***s Shirley  As an intransitive verb 
[00:55:00]  Shirley  F***s  Its meaning is not always sexual  It can be used as an adjective  Such as  John's doing all the f***ing work  As part of an adverb  Shirley talks too f***ing much  As an adverb  Enhancing an adjective  Shirley is f***ing beautiful  As a noun  I don't give a f***  As part of a word  Abso-f***ing-lutely  Or  In-f***ing-credible  And  As almost every word in a sentence 
[00:55:30]  F*** the f***ing f***ers  As you must realize  There aren't too many words  With the versatility of f***  As in these examples  Describing situations  Such as  Fraud  I got f***ed  At the used car lot  Dismay  Oh f*** it  Trouble  I guess I'm really f***ed now  Aggression  Don't f*** with me buddy  Difficulty  I don't understand  This f***ing question 
[00:56:00]  Inquiry  Who the f*** was that?  Dissatisfaction  I don't like what the f*** is going on here  Inconfidence  He's a f*** off  Dismissal  Why don't you go outside  And play hide  And go f*** yourself?  I'm sure you can think of many more examples  With all of these  Multi-purpose applications  How can anyone be offended  When you use the word?  We say  Use this unique  Flexible word 
[00:56:30]  More often  Than your daily speech  It will identify  The quality  Of your character  Immediately  Say it loudly  And proudly  F*** you  Alright  It's Opie and Anthony  Before we take a break  There's a great  Instant feedback  Coming up  Coming to our attention here  From AJ from Brooklyn  Yeah  I gotta read this one  This is all such BS  I'm black  And what happened yesterday  I've got no words  You're right Anthony  Speak your freaking mind  This society is so f***ed up 
[00:57:00]  And sensitive  It makes me sick  Blacks can talk about white folks  But you guys can't joke back  I like The Rock  Used to anyway  But if he's such a sensitive pussy  F*** The Rock  You guys rule  In Blazing Saddles  There were more nigger  And engine jokes  Than anything  What did people take offense with?  When Mongo dropped a horse  With one punch  This society is f***ed up  Later  You guys keep doing  What you're doing  Yeah  Very good AJ  You guys in conflict 
[00:57:30]  Piss me off  Okay  1027 WNEW  1027 WNEW  It's Opie and Anthony  And look who's in the studio  Anthony  Lewis  Lewis Black  From Comedy Central everyone  He's back  He remembers us  I remember you  I'll never forget you  You know  We played an old  Old tape of you this week  I heard that  Because we don't really feel like 
[00:58:00]  Working right at 2 o'clock  So we play some  And we're like  Yeah Lewis is good  For another spin  And it was all current stuff  So I guess we don't even  Have to do this today  This is great  That's perfect  Where you been  What have you been up to  I've been  Well I've been trying to find  A vein that works  You know  It's so difficult  To have to use needles  For so long  Who knew you were on the smack  It takes weeks  It takes weeks  Have you used the ones  In your penis yet  Oh no  Okay  Then I guess you don't  Really have a problem  So he's going 
[00:58:30]  Hear those junkie stories  Where they have to start  Using those veins  Right  That's when you know  You have the real problem  I was in  Well first I was going  To come by Christmas  But you guys took the week off  What sissy  Oh come on now  What to spend with your family  What  That's so bogus  We're going to stop for a while  And spend some time  I didn't even do that  I got away so I didn't have  To spend time with the family  Where'd you go  I went skiing  I blew off the family this year  Man  I did the family thing  Well you must have some family  You go back for the holidays  I'm Jewish 
[00:59:00]  So it's totally who cares  You know  The whole Hanukkah thing  I'm going to go back for Christmas  And look at a naked living room  Not a tree in sight  You didn't have that Hanukkah bush crap  Nah  We're a legitimate Jewish family  With Jewish concerns  Like you know  Like Hanukkah  Which is just a chumpster time of year boy  And then they'll start calling in  No it's not  It's a wonderful holiday  This is very special for our children  They like getting socks  Three days in a row  It's a miserable  A miserable holiday  So I don't really care 
[00:59:30]  So I worked actually  Caroline's that week  Oh you did  Yeah  Because apparently  Well apparently they think  I can draw against the baby Jesus  You know  That's a tough gig  They're going to either  You know  Kind of celebrate the birth  Of the son of God  Or go down and see that  Psychotic Jew boy  Oh what's the  What are we going to do  Well they didn't show up  I'll tell you that  You might need a better agent  I mean come on  But it was that  Actually it's  It was a great audience  Because you get  70 or 80 people 
[01:00:00]  You know  And it's Christmas Eve  That's a bitter crowd  Yeah  You know  Yeah  Yeah  You know  They're not a happy group of people  True  And New Year's Eve  New Year's Eve was  Big millennium  You must have some thoughts  On the millennium  I  The rage  Has not subsided  What they did  With the Y2K  Do you feel gyps  Gyps  I wanted a plane to fall out of the sky  I think we should just pick a date  As a nation  And have some fun  Okay  Just screw things up  Or something  No just get together as a group 
[01:00:30]  Like you know  What do they do  They basically  Don't go out  Don't go out  Don't move  All women who are going to give birth on that night  We're going to sew you up  We're going to sew you up  We don't know what will happen  If a baby's head appears  In the year 2000  We don't know what to do  It was incredible  Don't move  Don't move  Giant ticks could invade at any second  What a bunch of crap  So the entire country stays home  To watch other people celebrate around the world  So I'm sitting there at 9 in the morning going 
[01:01:00]  You know it's Afghanistan and nothing is happening  And I'm going  They're partying  And in Chicago it's like  Well we're going to have some  You know it's going to be a special time for us at home  Yeah  You know  And in Afghanistan  They can even rub two sticks together  They were having more fun than us  And if there's no problems in Afghanistan  I guess we would have been okay  But figure it out  But nobody came out  Right  Nobody came out  Still like uh oh  We're the ones who could screw up  Seven year olds  Left alone in a closet  Do not have the paranoid vision  That we came up with  For New Year's Eve 
[01:01:30]  We all had this apocalyptic vision  Oh man  Planes out of the sky  Buildings blowing up  Anarchy in the streets  I did this thing  And it turned out to be true  I did this thing on the  When we had our Millennium Special  On The Daily Show  And one of the few things  That I really was pleased with  They did a thing about the fact that  It already occurred  What were they talking to me  This is it  Hello  Yeah  It occurred about three and a half years ago  You know  And now  What's the big change going to be 
[01:02:00]  More channels  More crap on television  The raw sewage network  That'll be the big change  You know  We've got to the point  Where the attention deficit disorder  Has attention deficit disorder  We were just so screwed up  We didn't even notice  Oh we were embracing  Oh look  It's going to be a wonderful day  Look at this  I might like the raw sewage channel  You know something  There'd probably be a night  Where I'd sit there  And go  Look at the way it flows  I mean  It's beautiful  Why not  I could watch the raw sewage channel  Too funny  And then the whole concept 
[01:02:30]  Of the terrorists terrorizing  Yes  They welded the manhole cover shut  In Times Square  To get rid of those subterranean  What was that movie?  Chud  Remember that?  They thought Chud  Was going to invade Times Square  You know  Carnivorous humanoid  Underground dwellers  I think it was Chud  Very good  That's frightening  That you remember that  Yes it is  It is  I can't remember  What happened Thursday  Well he hasn't used  All his veins yet  That's why 
[01:03:00]  I'm injecting directly  Into the retina  Right now  Yeah they welded  The manhole cover shut  And then  You know what's really frightening?  They installed  I mean hundreds  Of surveillance cameras  In Times Square  For the millennium  To thwart the terrorists  That were going to strike  They're not taking them down  No  They are not removing these things  No  This is new cameras  That are all over  There's cameras everywhere  You ever notice  You can't be on the streets  Without being on some camera  Cameras in the stores 
[01:03:30]  Cameras on the streets  By the lights  There's cameras everywhere  You sound right  They put them up  They're not taking them down  They ain't taking them down  Oh that's profound  Hell no  Ant was the only New Yorker  In Times Square  For the big celebration  I wasn't in Times Square  I was high above Times Square  Where were you?  I was in this building  On the 35th floor  Oh what a view  Oh it was fantastic  He crashed the party  He crashed the party  I'm walking around  I went upstairs  A sign said  Party 2000  That's for me  I walked in  Is that right?  I was like  Hey how you doing?  They're like 
[01:04:00]  Hey you want a drink?  Yeah sure  We just hung out  It was amazing  The best was your pass though  The hotel you were staying at  Actually gave out passes  Yeah because the security  In Manhattan  The security was amazing  If you were in New York City  On New Year's Eve  You could not walk  Block to block  Without a hall pass  Like in school  I got one  The Parker Meridian  Had to hand me  A pass  That I had to give  To police officers  At roadblocks  Saying I just got to pee  I'll be right back  Oh man  Let me raise my hand  That's unbelievable 
[01:04:30]  I just don't understand  Why terrorists  Would terrorize New York  It's kind of redundant  You know  Why would you terrorize  A city that  You know  We do professionally  Our mayor terrorizes us  Okay  What do we need  Somebody come in  If you're going to go  Be a terrorist  Terrorize a place  Where they're going to notice  You know  If they blow a couple  Of buildings here  We go  Ooh it's a view  I wonder what  They're going to build  There next  The buildings fall down  On their own  Around here  A bunch of friggin  Whatever the hell  That was  Ooh  The guys that tried  To blow up  The World Trade Center 
[01:05:00]  Of those  Yeah  A truckload  Of explosives  In the basement  Boom  The thing shakes  If your windows  Break some smoke  It doesn't fall down  They move a crane wrong  In Times Square  Chunks of building  Are taking out the elderly  You're right  Why bother  With the terrorism  It just happens  On its own  Around here  On its own  I mean  The best  This is one  I knew  I truly  Made the transition  You know  That thing  Oh you walk  By the homeless  You don't see 
[01:05:30]  Them  I was in a subway  About seven years ago  Coming  Down  Going downtown  From a club  Uptown  And in the  We stop at 14th street  And they announce  The doors open  And go  Well ladies and gentlemen  It's 14th street  And we  There's a  There's apparently  A bomb on board  This time  Could you  Could you  Please  Exit immediately  And nobody moved  Nobody moved  I didn't even get up  I didn't want to  I just sat there  Well yeah right  We've heard it before 
[01:06:00]  If you're in New York  You've heard it all  Let's kind of like  Show us  Okay  Show us  That apparently word  I'm not giving up my seat  Show us  And I don't see it  It's not in my car  You know  I've only got  People going  I've only got  Two stops to go  Let's give it a run  I'm willing to  Take a chance  Oh very good  But anyway  It was just  It was so brutal  That whole experience  That it was  You know  I was a kid 
[01:06:30]  I'm old enough  So that I look  To the millennium  As really  You know  God  I'm going to be  Born in  Right  You know  Lifetime  And this is going to  And they're constantly  Telling you  Oh you're going to  Live to be  The year 2000  In 2001  The movie came out  You know  And I did enough  Drugs then  That I think  Part of my brain  Is still left there  With him and the pod  But that's another story  But you know  You kind of  Like anticipate this  And you know  And I just felt like  You know  Once again  I'm a sucker  Yeah  I'm a sucker  I bought it  I bought it  And then they crushed me 
[01:07:00]  And I performed that night  28 people  In Chicago  Showed up  28  And you know  That's a room  Of fun people  When they're sitting  Around the room  You know  And they're thinking  God you know  I think I made  A terrible mistake  I said it would have  Been more fun  Running around the room  Lifting them  And guessing their weight  Which was the second show  Right  Yeah  That was the second show  For you  It was extraordinary  I just  I could not  But I  But here's  Christmas Eve 
[01:07:30]  About 8, 7, 6 years ago  I was in  Playing  Performing  Get Again  You know  Because it was  When I was really up  And I thought  Okay sure  I'll take on  The baby Jesus  And it was  Three people  In Washington  Oh my god  Three people  In the audience  And the guy  Made us perform  He was planning  He said  No you're going to perform  And I  And so  Couldn't you just  Take him for a ride  In your car  Exactly  A little more interesting  You know  Put him in the back seat  Put him in the back seat  And do your act  It's exactly it  The first two comics  Went up and performed 
[01:08:00]  I go up  I'm 8 minutes into the act  And one of the guys  Leaves the room  Uh oh  He walks  I turn to the audience  And I said  Aren't you glad  That prick is gone  The audience  The couple  I said  Isn't this great  It's just us  Thank god  He was bringing  This room so down  That's awful  I went and sat  At the table  I did table counting  Oh that's cool 
[01:08:30]  I sat with him  You might as well  At that point  I just talked to him  Why be on the stage  Why are you any better  Than them  And then I thought  It was depressing for me  And this guy had  It was like  If you were a comic  This club was heaven  It ran in Washington  For a while  It was downstairs  It was a strip club  Yeah  Next floor  With great food  Which is where  They'd serve you the food  So you'd go out for dinner  And there'd be  There's a little leery  Of the strip clubs  That serve food  You know  It's free  So you go  And then  And then  The second floor  Was the sports bar  And then the comedians 
[01:09:00]  I mean it was like  Wow  I said if you had a bed here  I'd never leave  Sure  But I went downstairs  And there was  I had two for my show  And I go downstairs  They had one person  One person  And it's Christmas Eve  And there's decorations  Who goes to the strip joint  On Christmas Eve?  Well you know  I thought  There'd be some nice  Jewish girls  Oh yeah  The Hanukkah thing  Yeah  I forgot about that  Yes sir  And now  Sheila  In the buff  Will light the candles  We feel like we were 
[01:09:30]  We feel like we were robbed though  For the millennium  I don't know  As a kid  You know  I don't know one person  That didn't sit there  And do the math  And figure out  How old you were going to be  In the year 2000  The movies they showed you  Like 2001  They want to space out  They got a year  To build that big wheel  And send a ship to Jupiter  Yeah  One year  2001  Where are our flying cars?  Where are the jetpacks?  We saw at the World's Fair  Yeah  You know  Nothing  The robots for our houses  We're still driving  Internal combustion automobiles 
[01:10:00]  Oh sure  They look a little flashier  And what do we get  Cell phones  Yeah  We get the total detritus  The crap of the whole heat  So people can't drive  The internal combustion cars  Because they're  They're friggin' on the cell phones  They can't dial  And they can't get enough  Information out of their cell phones  Look at those things  Now you can get  Oh now  I mean it's like  What?  And a TV  There's one with a TV  Yeah that's  It's like Spock's tricorder now  For God's sake  You can see where the  The little beast is  Behind the rock  Exactly  On your cell phone 
[01:10:30]  Unbelievable  But everywhere else  We got rooked  Yeah  I thought we'd be flying around  In those Jetsons cars by now  Yeah  Nothing  Nothing  We got crap  And then they take away the fun  They take away the fun  Boy  No drink  Did you see that?  There was no drinking in Times Square  Yeah  They corralled the people up  In what amounted to cages  Yes  They caged them  In between the blocks  Where they couldn't move  For nine or ten hours  I don't  What  How much brain power do you have  To be standing  On like one of those cross streets 
[01:11:00]  Yeah  Packed in  Where you're not even seeing  You can't even see  What's going on  You can't even see  At least  Okay if you're in New Orleans  And you got like a drink in your hand  Sure  But  And people were packed in there  Like seven  What did they do from seven to twelve  I do not  If I went through my life  I would have to go through my life  A billion times  I would have to make stuff up  I'd have to pretend things  Yeah now you're talking to people  I mean 
[01:11:30]  And you're not sitting down  It's freezing  Yeah  What in the name of God  No booze  And you know how interesting people are  When you're not drunk  When you're not drunk  For five straight hours  For five hours  Someone you don't know  Well we're convinced  Katie got her booze though  Katie Couric  She looked blitzed  The news just went crazy  On the right thing  See I missed it  Oh my god  All the coverage was astounding  Tom Brokaw  Miss me right  Just seeing him try to say the word  Millennium  Had me dying  And Katie Couric  I don't know if she's a lady 
[01:12:00]  That likes to drink  In my professional drinking opinion  The woman was smashed  Is that right?  She's on Times Square  She's on Times Square  A little  Literally on Times Square  Laying down  I mean at one point  She looked  That's not it  No  Yeah  And she was so depressed  That nothing was going on  With the white  Yeah all the news people  Freaked out  Because nothing happened  Nothing happened  The pigs  People  In 1201  People are huddled  Around their dishwashers  Weeping with joy  Look it started again  It's going to work 
[01:12:30]  It's going to work  And then these  And then you get these  I don't even know  What I was going to say  I had a thought  I thought I could back  One thought with another  And then all of a sudden  It's Y2K  I watched the flames occur  I thought my god  It was a good thought  I think we need to take a break  Are you performing  Because I know you're performing here  Obviously  But someone's on the line  Where's Lewis Black  Performing next?

[01:20:30]  Hey Jay before we let you go  What's your opinion  On the whole Bill Parcells thing  Man  Everyone talking about  The Jets situation  Well I think Belichick's  Kind of a fag  He's not a very good  Head coach anyway  Yeah  He's a great defensive mind  Well he's gone  But he's never been a great head coach  No  And the excuses he used were so pathetic  The fact that he compared the Browns moving in the dead of night to Baltimore 
[01:21:00]  And changing coaches and stadiums  Comparing Matt to Leon Hess dying  Comparing the two situations as the craziness when owners die or move  Yeah  It's just so ludicrous  And the fact that he accepted a two year extension on his contract  So no other team could talk to him  If he goes to the Patriots  They'll be in litigation for a very long time  I think we should get Ditka  You think?  Ditka's  No  I was getting scared there for a second

[01:40:30]  You know and she comes  You know this has got to stop  Somebody has got to pull her aside  Did you want  Have you watched her  Or maybe I'm just losing my grip  But I was watching her yesterday in that interview  And she's talking  She's standing  She is completely detached  It's like somebody is funneling a voice through her at this point  She has absolutely no  There's no meshing of her emotion  And who she  There's nothing  It's ridiculous  Like a cyborg  She is isn't it  It's like a Stepford one  I would be a good senator  I would be good for all of us 
[01:41:00]  And then she kind of  There's that creepy smile  And she's got no  Nothing to back it up  Like anything  She doesn't have really any plan  No  Or anything  She just says you know  Vote me in  Be good  Be good  That's it  That those bull guys have heard  And then they're going to give him 10 million bucks  Did you read that one?  Yeah  A job on Wall Street  A job on Wall Street  Because you know he's so smart  He's so damn smart  He's so damn smart  Out of that  He's you know  He parlays that into a 10 million dollar 
[01:41:30]  It is not right  Oh you know that's just saying  You look at  The man did that well in office  Guess what  He's an idiot  Okay  You know let him near money  Let him wave at people  Let him touch behinds  That job on Wall Street  Yeah  Oh yeah  Is that what he's getting  Oh yeah  So how do you think he'll get into wire?  The subway?  Oh yeah  The subway  They'll chop her in  Yeah I'm sure  Him and the  What did you think of Donald Trump running to be the  Oh what a joke  That's a goof 
[01:42:00]  I can't believe they're reporting this as a real story  Are there no  There are no adults left in the room  Right  Isn't there somebody  You know  Like in the late 70's  A little class  A little wit  A little isn't  Take him into a small room  Donald come here  Guess what  No  No  No talk  No talk  No  Hey  That's it  No  He's got all his yes men  I would love to see him get in  Just so you could hear the press go up  And here's Donald Trump taking his wife to the 7th grade 
[01:42:30]  First first lady ever  That's still in junior high  You see his little chippy  Yeah  It's like one of his daughter's model friends  Yeah it's insane  Amazing  And then when I actually heard he was running my teeth  Tried to reach around to eat my brain  That was my first reaction  What a  Guy thinks he's a self-made man  What horse  His father's like one of the richest men ever  Yeah  Built all of these buildings in New York  Donald Trump's father could have chosen not to have children 
[01:43:00]  And had a chimp that just crapped its cage  For 40 years  And that chimp would be worth as much as Donald is today  Okay  I'd turn to vote for the chimp  Oh are you kidding me  I want a chimp as president  I want a scooter  And I think it would be great  And then you'd go  You'd turn on  And we'd have like in the White House  You'd just turn it on  And he'd be running around  That'd be hysterical  A monkey chimp  Just an out of control chimp  Running around the Oval Office  Really  With a couple of trainers who chase him  A State of the Union address  And just crapping  And spanking one out on the desk 
[01:43:30]  It'd be perfect  I thought we were talking about the monkey  Mark what's up?  Yeah I wanted to ask Louis  Well first of all  I wanted to say Louis  I think you're great  If you're on Comedy Central  Well thanks  I wonder what your opinion was  Of NASA's repeated success  With surveying Mars  I love it  It's my favorite stuff  Because eventually  We're going to find out where it went  And that'll be like  Well I won't  But you know  Our children's children 
[01:44:00]  We'll discover where it is  It'll just be a huge pile of crap  On Mars  I want them to keep shooting stuff up there  You know  Because eventually  We're going to find  I like the idea of space travel  That's all  I was born and raised in the suburbs  What does that prepare you for?  Space travel  Okay  After you live there  After you live in a place  That has no real place  It's not a place  The suburbs  So the next place is Mars  Or any other place  Any other kind of a lonely planet  I'm looking forward to it  I can't believe they can't get another 
[01:44:30]  You know remember how excited we all were  With that first little Tonka toy thing  Driving around on Mars  Yeah  They can't do it again  That just shows you what a fluke  That first one was  Yeah  If it was real at all  Also  Yeah the idea like  That they're going to  That you know  When they were saying  They're going to send somebody up  In a certain amount of time  It's really big  Can you imagine?

Venus you idiot  I've always loved NASA though  I always loved that crap

Rock this is one of the millions of fans  I was calling to find out  What kind of injuries  You've ever sustained in the ring  In the ring  Other than a couple of knee injuries  Had a couple of surgeries already  That done shoulder injuries all the time  Pretty much your typical  Bumps and bruises  Yeah you can see time and time again  You see like black and blue marks  On some of the wrestlers  From going off the ring and everything  What about when you flip over the top?  What's that do to you?  Well you won't see too much  Flipping over the top from The Rock 
[02:07:30]  Not like the Hardy Boys  Or anything like that  They get into it  That ladder match  Is still one of the most  That's phenomenal  Amazing things I've ever seen  We got Sick Boy in the studio  He's like a wrestling expert  You got a quick question  For The Rock there  Sick Boy  He's been chomping at the bit  All afternoon  Yeah I was actually  Kind of curious about  Remember the MTV special  Over the summer  They had the feature on  Tony Atlas  Who was your dad's tag team partner  I was kind of wondering  If you saw that  And what you thought about  They kind of highlighted  Some of the hard times  That Tony's gone through 
[02:08:00]  Over the years  And him talking about  Being so desperate  That he wanted to kill himself  And all that  And just what your thought  On it was  You know  With your dad being his partner  Well before The Rock  Actually answers  I just had a curiosity  You know The Rock's  Heard of your name  And The Rock's got a question  For you regarding your website  Oh no  Actually I had no idea  It was you  Who goes by the name  Sick Boy  But it was brought to my attention  Last night from the office  That your website 
[02:08:30]  Carries a lot of racist comments  And I just want  To hear about that  And for the most part  I just want to know  It sounds like  All you guys are friends  And if you guys have known  That this is a guy  Who has racist comments  On his website  And if in fact  You guys are behind that  Oh I've seen his website  A few times  He's got a bunch of writers  On there  And I think they just  Open it up  To everything  Yeah I don't think  There's anything  Ever been racist  No more than any  Of the humor  That goes on in this show  Wait now  Don't blame our show  Don't want busted for that 
[02:09:00]  Well I'll tell you what  You know  After it was read  A couple of lines  Were read yesterday  They obviously called me  Read a couple of lines  For me  Said something like  You know  The Rock being half black  Half Samoan  Doesn't know whether  He should go  Rob houses  Or eat food  Or whatever it is  And saying  Jacqueline's from the jungle  And Mark Henry  Something about  You know  Him being a gorilla  Or a monkey  Or something like that  Elaborate on that  And if that's the case  If you guys are behind  This guy  Then really  I really don't even  Want to be here  For that matter  And I certainly  Don't want to talk to you 
[02:09:30]  Look I mean  If there's been  Any  I mean  This is nothing  That's been written by me  I've got a staff of 15 writers  That are on the site  And the site is done  As an entertainment site  You know  Adding humor  And just commentary  On what goes on  In wrestling  I haven't seen anything  That was racist  On the site  If there was anything  That I ever saw  As being too extreme  It would be gone  In a heartbeat  You know  There's been plenty  Of stuff  That gets  Well being saying  That Jacqueline  Is from the jungle  And Mark Henry  Is a monkey  And whether or not  The Rock  Wants to rob houses 
[02:10:00]  Because he's half black  Or he wants to eat  Because he's half Samoan  Quite frankly  I find that offensive  Well I haven't seen that  I mean  I haven't  I haven't seen those posts  At all  I don't know  If anybody else has  I'll be honest  I've never read any of that  I mean  I've never seen  One thing up on  Up on my site  That would ever  Be racist  Because that's not  You know  That's not how I was raised  And that's not how  I would run a website  Well it's on there  Well I haven't seen it on there  If it's on there  It will absolutely be removed 
[02:10:30]  But you know  I absolutely do not condone  Nor do I you know  Support any of the statements made  And if you know  Somebody on there  Has made racist comments like that  They're absolutely going to be fired  Can I be excused?  Oh  Really?  Wow  Alright  Well for the most part  It's one of those things  Where again  I was contacted  I was made aware of it  And the office was made aware of it  And quite frankly  I don't want to have anything  To do with you  I don't want to answer your questions 
[02:11:00]  And if you guys  Have anything to do with this guy  I quite frankly  Don't want to have anything  To do with you guys  Honestly  I've never read  Any of that stuff on the site  And that's not the truth  No we have  We have him on  Whenever we have wrestlers on  He's an expert  Knows a lot about it  We have that on  I don't know anything  About any racist postings  Like I said  We don't condone that either  Well it was bumped  My attention last night  And it was read to me  Over the phone  In detail  When you have  When you have  An open forum 
[02:11:30]  Especially on the internet  There's not really much  You can do about  Well apparently  It was from the writers  Who you must employ  Somehow  Well they're not  They're not paid writers  At all  They're just  They're hired  Based on their writing skills  But if I had known  Somebody was  Or lack of  For that matter  Well you know  I apologize for anything  That you may have  Taken offense to  I absolutely  You know  Do not condone  That type of writing  Especially on my website  You know  It's something  That I put a lot  Of hard work into  And it's been up  For two years now  And you know 
[02:12:00]  We've put a lot  Of energy  And a lot of money  Into it  To make it  Something to be proud of  And for something  Like that to be honest  It's a black eye  To the site  And it's a black eye  To me  And you know  I apologize  To you and Jacqueline  And you know  Anybody else  From the WWF  Who if somebody  Had made a comment  Like that to them  Then they will  Absolutely be gone  You mean  African American  Set  Alright  Enough with that  Wow 
[02:12:30]  Boy that  Sure turns  Around quick  Look at that  What the hell  You doing  So what else  Guys  Let's wrap this up  Yeah no problem  God damn  You ruined  Our interview  With The Rock  What the hell  We were all  Having fun  Alright  Well we still  Want to thank you  For coming by  I appreciate it  Yeah  Alright  Absolutely  Hope you don't  Hit us  Well no  I mean  If you know  Of this  And if you 
[02:13:00]  Tell me the truth  If you know this  I'm giving you  My word  You don't know  Much about me  But I honestly  Never read anything  Like that on his  Website  And that is my  My word  I'm not backing  Down or anything  I've never read  Anything like that  And that's the  God's honest truth  Alright  I believe it's there  I'm not going to lie  But you know  If you say it's there  But  I was pretty much there  You know  For the most part  Again I was  Bought to my attention  Last night  Sat on front  For a good couple  Of hours  And made the  Publishers aware  And I had no  Idea  No idea  It was then  But I appreciate 
[02:13:30]  You guys having me on  Thank you  Okay  Book signing  Starting  And there it was  From yesterday  Oh  That's weird  Isn't that weird  What a difference  Should they make  Thank God  Lewis came here  To give us some humor  If we had a naked  Girl yesterday  I think everything  Would have been fine  And the Rock's  A little angry  With the racist  Oh Christ  Look boobies  And everything's cool  The Rock apologizes  For calling you a racist 
[02:14:00]  Bring on the gash  We talked about it  The first hour  Of the show today  But basically  You know  What pisses me off  And we did say  Right from the start  Of today's show  If he wants to come back  On our show today  By phone or live  I don't care  I'll say this to his face  As well  Not anymore  Right  That's it  He can't come now  But I think the guy  And I said this earlier  Statue of limitations  I said it earlier  I think the guy's a pussy  Because  Oh my God  No no no  He's okay  And I would say it to his face  And we did say  He could come back  And I'll tell you why  Because after  After that whole segment 
[02:14:30]  Was done and we went  To commercials  Any man would have  Would have stayed behind  And maybe talked  For a few more minutes  That guy turned his head  And  Out the door  I'm sorry to say  From listening to that  The only people  That sounded like pussies  Were me  You  And sick boy  Well we said that earlier too  Because  We were blindsided  Yeah absolutely  I didn't know where  That was coming from  It's not  It's yours  My favorite is  You know  You go  You know  At least we can say  We're glad you came in  And then you go  Yeah yeah we are  Really glad 
[02:15:00]  Please don't beat us up  You huge man  I mean you got  A professional wrestler  The guy's giant  Sitting there  See him every week  On TV  Like three times a week  And you know  He blindsides it like that  It's kind of hard  To come back with something  And we're guilty  By association  I never even saw  What he was talking about  Yeah  That's the weird thing  That's what pisses me off  Well that's the weirdest  That it's  You know  That he saw it  Nobody else saw it  Well I thought a lot  About it last night  While watching some  Amos and Andy reruns 
[02:15:30]  That it was  Why  Check please  Bellboy  This bag is full  But he wants to talk  About stereotyping  And stuff like that  What does he look  At the company he works for  I mean we have no problem  With what the WWF does  But why don't you start  With your job  Yeah they got a guy  Called the Godfather  That comes out  And says  The black guy  Pimping ain't easy  He's a pimp  Right  He comes out with four hoes 
[02:16:00]  These strippers  That come out with him  Anybody want a piece  Of my fine hoes  Pimping ain't easy  I'll be pimping 24-7  Like he's a total black stereotype  But that's okay  Yeah he works for an organization  Because it's the company  That's writing the rocks check  Yeah they exploit stereotypes  And I don't  I have no problem with that  But yeah exactly  They cut to check  So he's not going to say  Anything in house there  Isn't it a little weird  How he didn't even  Break character  Because he wasn't  In character the whole time 
[02:16:30]  But that whole thing  How he talks about himself  In third person  Didn't stop  Like usually  Somebody would say  You know hey  I'm not going to answer  Your question  Because the things  That you put on your website  Pissed me off  He's like  Well the rock  Isn't going to answer  Your questions  Because the rock  Was informed about this  And the rock  Is a little  It's like well  Who are you talking about  Bring the rock in  And we'll talk about it  With him  He still talked about himself  In third person  It's a little weird  Isn't it  Yes it is  Think he does that all the time  Think he does that in bed  With his wife  The rock's slamming you right now 
[02:17:00]  The rock's giving you  A good one  Isn't he  I think you're  A heads up  From between your legs  Because you guys are  Probably the biggest marks  In the business  Biggest marks  What do you mean  Biggest marks  You guys are the biggest friends  You know you talked  A big game today  But yesterday  You guys were  Clamming up there  We explained it all earlier  We were in complete shock  What was going on  And we gave him the form  Again today  You know  Because now we're  A little more prepared  About what he was  Wanted to bring up  And we're ready to go 
[02:17:30]  Yeah well  Ready to go  We did say that  He could come right in here  Right now  Now that we have  Fifteen guys with us  I know yesterday  It sounded like you guys  Were ready to get on  That motorcycle together  You know what I'm talking about  Right  Hop on the jet ski  Here you go  I'm pissed off at myself  I'm totally  Friggin pissed off at myself  Oh  Totally  Like we  We completely  Came off  Like we backed down  And just  You know  Gave in  We came off
