<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion on the hosts' varying levels of disgust towards different bodily fluids. Opie vehemently declared his hatred of snot, second only to feces, sharing anecdotes about his nasal hygiene practices and the ubiquity of boogers in public restrooms, particularly police station urinals.  One host recounted a childhood habit of eating old gum.  A caller, Tom from Cape Cod, described a horrifying incident involving a violent inmate and a colostomy bag.  The discussion also included one host's extreme reaction to a booger on his couch, resulting in the couch's disposal.

The show then transitioned into a lengthy interview with voice actor Billy West.  He discussed his career, touching upon his work on *Beavis and Butthead*, *Ren & Stimpy*, and other projects. He compared his early career to Howard Stern's, referencing his role in *Private Parts* as a guide for aspiring radio personalities.  West shared anecdotes about his impressions of celebrities like Bob Hope and Phil Hartman, including a poignant recollection of a pre-death phone call from Hartman. He also discussed the controversy surrounding his Marge Schott impression and the different audience reactions to offensive material across various media. The segment concluded with further bathroom humor involving the hosts, and various radio schedule promotions.

Following West, Huey Lewis joined the show in-studio.  The conversation covered Lewis's career, his experience with MTV, Broadway (performing in *Chicago*), the use of his music in films like *American Psycho*, and his views on the changing music industry. He discussed the challenges of maintaining relevance over decades, including balancing audience preferences for hit songs with the need for creative fulfillment through new material.  The hosts and Lewis shared humorous anecdotes about fame and fan interactions.  They also recounted a bizarre encounter with a Bill O'Reilly producer with a prosthetic arm.  The segment included several caller questions for both Billy West and Huey Lewis.  Frequent offensive language and sexually explicit references were present throughout this segment.

The show continued with a segment focusing on the deterioration of customer service, featuring several callers detailing negative experiences with Dell's outsourced support, including long hold times, unhelpful representatives, and order fulfillment issues.  Callers also shared their struggles with resolving issues with a bank account closure and faulty EasyPass toll charges.

The next section started with a discussion about car stickers, including one supporting "free fat Nick," followed by a caller, Eric from Colorado, recounting his ordeal with a US-based company's poor customer service.  A Russian caller then boasted about the superiority of Russian work ethic.  The show interspersed these calls with advertisements for NHL and FIFA World Cup coverage on XM Satellite Radio, a promotion for the show's "Whip'em Out Wednesday" segment, and an advertisement for the Ron and Fez Show.

An in-studio interview with Isaac Hayes followed.  The conversation focused extensively on Hayes' personal life, including his four marriages and eleven children, using explicit language to describe past relationships.  He also discussed his career, his work on *South Park*, his Scientology beliefs, his views on psychiatry and pharmaceutical drugs, and anecdotes about Richard Pryor.  A listener asked about his child support payments, to which Hayes confirmed he always supported his children.  The interview concluded with further discussions of Scientology and various XM Radio programming advertisements.

The show's final segment began with XM Radio advertisements for baseball and other sports programming.  Opie then performed a humorous, self-deprecating, and highly offensive figure skating routine, followed by a chaotic sponsor announcement for Sexits.com, featuring a studio appearance by its representatives and Jeanette Meyer, who identified herself as the "Canal Street Madam" and discussed her involvement in a sex trafficking ring.  This portion involved significant interruptions, overt sexual innuendo, and further offensive language. Earl, a frequent show contributor, made a brief appearance, described as unusually excited and participating in a photo opportunity. The broadcast concluded with more XM Radio advertisements.  Throughout the entire broadcast, offensive language and sexually explicit subject matter were frequently used.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn.  It's not a germ thing with me.  Dude.  It's not a germ thing.  I don't have a germ thing.  It's one lousy booger.  It's a booger.  If you're not a germ thing, it's not a germ thing, it's not a germ thing.  It's not a germ thing.  It's not a germ thing.  It's only surpassed by shit. 
[00:05:00]  It's a germ thing.  First on the list, disgusting thing ever that could come out of a human being is shit.  If it was near me or around me, God forbid, on me, I'd lose my mind.  Okay.  So that's number one, the evil of all evils to come out of a human body.  Second on the list, second is snot.  I agree.  If snot gets near or around me or, God forbid, on me, I will freak out.  If it's on my couch, I throw the couch away. 
[00:05:30]  I agree.  Third, splooch, probably puss.  Puss?  Some form of puss.  Yes, puss.  So wait, there's like three things you could think of that are worse in your mouth than a load.  I didn't say in my mouth.  Because...  You want to take a load than need a booger?  Here comes the promo.  Because I've had...  No, think of it this way.  I'm even talking about myself.  So I'm talking about snot or anything coming out of me. 
[00:06:00]  It disgusts me.  And if, you know, who hasn't shot a load on their own gut, right?  It doesn't disgust you.  And it goes down to urine, you know, things like that down the line.  Urine's one of the least, really.  I know.  It really is.  You take a leak.  You're leaking so much.  At this point, it's your best friend.  Why not, right?  What about earwax?  Earwax is pretty up there, too.  That's up there.  Earwax, probably right after puss.  It's like a buttery goodness. 
[00:06:30]  It's tart.  You ever put your tongue on your finger after you stick it in the earwax?  Don't make me...  You almost made snot come out of my nose.  You would never eat like a big watery runny booger?  God damn it!  It's like sucking down a loose piece of pasta.  Stop it!  It's got a nice salty tinge to it.  You just made me do the cricket snort.  If I inadvertently, like, you suck in and you feel something more than just mucus go down the back of your throat.  You've never eaten your boogers? 
[00:07:00]  Never!  Not one.  Not one time.  I can say, in all of my years, I have never, ever, ever eaten one of my boogers.  Not once.  I have never even contemplated it.  Really?  I have actually been repulsed at the very thought so as not to even accidentally ingest a booger.  I have never, ever, ever eaten a booger.  You never yanked one of them off a little hair in the nose, one of those little fat ones?  Oh, those are wonderful.  No, and if I'm picking at something, I can't even look at it. 
[00:07:30]  I have to get it away and off of me and cleanse my hand immediately.  It has to go.  And when I used to work on the job and see those construction workers plug off one nostril with the thumb and go,  Oh, the snot rocket.  And the snot rocket.  Those things rock.  It would disturb me for hours and I couldn't eat my lunch.  Bill Madden taught me the snot rocket when I was back in, like, junior high.  We were playing basketball.  He's like, and I need a tissue.  He's like, screw that. 
[00:08:00]  Just do what I do.  Right on the sideline.  He didn't care.  Right on the cheerleaders if they were too close.  If I blow my nose, I have to have a mirror right there, too, so I can make sure there's nothing hanging.  And I have to, like, make, like, these things out of the toilet paper, the tissues, that I can shove up my nose and twist around and pull out, like, rubber bands and make sure every bit of it's gone.  You know what you do?  So you wrap the toilet paper around the finger, and then you put the finger in it, and you can dig and pick and scrape with your nail under the paper.  Yeah, but sometimes it pushes it up.  I found what's better is a loosely packed little twist of toilet paper. 
[00:08:30]  And then you can put it up there, jiggle it around a little bit, and it kind of grabs on and pulls it right out.  Yeah.  So your thoughts, Anthony, on people that eat their own boogers?  People that eat their own boogers?  These are not people that you want living in your neighborhood.  Do you want this as your neighbor, your friend, the person sitting next to you at church?  Maybe on the job, on the go, even looking out the window of your automobile as you cruise this great land. 
[00:09:00]  Do you want to look over and see some animal picking, digging, straining up to the knuckle to pull out some of that green goodness?  Take a look at it, slowly roll it between his finger and thumb as he ponders the taste of it.  I don't even know what he's thinking when he's gazing into this glistening green orb between his fingers. 
[00:09:30]  But what does he do with it, people?  Does he get a tissue and dispose of the ugliness?  Does he wipe it somewhere, never to see it again?  No.  He looks at it like it's some type of meal and slowly puts it in his mouth and then chomps on it between his little teeth.  Before he, I don't know, swallows it, puts it between his cheek and gum like a skull.  I don't know what goes on with the booger after it goes in his mouth, but it's there. 
[00:10:00]  It's horrific.  We need to do something about these booger eaters.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, people.  The booger is not.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No, great.  Thank you.  We as non-booger.  Thank you, people.  Thank you, please.  Thank you. 
[00:10:30]  I say, put the booger down.  Awful.  Snot is the reason I won't eat rice pudding, says Clark Gifford from Whack Bag.  I have no idea what that means, but something struck a nerve there.  Rice pudding.  Rice pudding is an awful invention.  Do you know there are dominatrices that, well, I've read stories.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Don't even say it.  No, it's not what you think.  La, la, la, la.  It's not what you think.  It's not what you think.  Snot rockets around the chest?  No, where she'll actually put her nose in your mouth and blow her nose in your mouth. 
[00:11:00]  It's worse than I think.  You're right.  That is horrible.  I'll tell you the most disgusting thing for me is, to be honest with you, period.  There's nothing that gets me more than that.  That, to me, is number one.  Clark Clifford from Whack Bag also saying,  snot is like the caviar of body fluids when compared to shit.  It really is.  Very funny with the food analogies there, Clark.  Yeah, that can't, um...  You don't enjoy the buttery goodness of a... 
[00:11:30]  Of the earwax?  Duh!  No.  No.  Earwax must also be cleaned out with a rolled up piece of tissue.  He's a Q-tip.  Q-tips freak me out.  They're too small.  I don't know what they're doing in there.  How do you clean your ears?  I take a piece of tissue paper and roll it up.  Roll it up, stick it in there, and...  Like that, and then pull it out.  And that's just as good.  Because I...  I don't know.  They're too hard at the tip sometimes. 
[00:12:00]  No.  And they're small.  You never know how far to stick them in.  Yes, you do.  If you stick toilet paper in, it'll crunch back if you go too far.  There's no safety spring on a...  Nah.  Yes, sir.  I now know the problem with his headphones.  It's his ears.  He's got a wax buildup that's about four inches thick.  What?  No.  You've got to scrape it out of there with a little...  I scrape it out really good with the tissue.  I love looking at that yellow on the Q-tip.  Oh, yeah.  No, I wind it around like a corkscrew in there.  When I forget to clean my ears for a while, and I go in for some goodness, and it comes 
[00:12:30]  out, it'll skee me out.  Like extra crunchy jiff.  Oh, my God.  I didn't know I was lying on peanut butter all night long.  It's just...  Should I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with this?  You know how you know your ears are filthy?  Like when you scrape it, it's not yellow, but it's a brownish yellow,  and it's actually up off the Q-tip.  Almost.  It's not just on the Q-tip.  It's like you pulled a physical piece of something out.  Like your Q-tip is wearing a hat.  Oh, God.  Earwax is not a hat. 
[00:13:00]  It's like a scab or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  You know, this is something that freaks me out.  I've been a cop now 13 years.  Yeah.  And I've worked all over the city.  There's not one police station in this city that I have not gone into and walked into a  urinal that there's not boogers on the wall.  Oh, the people picking and wiping?  I don't know if it's one cop that just goes around the whole city and picks his nose and  wipes the booger on the wall, but there's not one urinal in the whole city.  You ever lean forward and lick that wall?  Yeah! 
[00:13:30]  Wow!  Why not?  And then they try and like, sometimes they try and see how far up on the wall they can  get it.  And the prisoners do that with shit, too.  Like monkeys throwing their crap around.  Right.  I've seen a cell where they'll, like, you know, I guess they'll do the finger in the  ass or something, and then they try and see how far they can get it up on the wall.  Up on the wall.  That's a little contest.  That's great.  A little contest for them to buy the time.  Jimmy, did you try that when you were downtown?  I hated it.  I tell you, that made me a better citizen.  I'll never get arrested again.  Never get arrested, see? 
[00:14:00]  They taught you a lesson.  One night was all it took.  Brutal.  Oh, it was awful.  God!  That's disgusting.  Yeah, the booger on the thing, the problem with the booger on the precinct wall is if you  lick it, it won't come off.  It's like a hard little bump.  It's like a genital wart on the wall.  People, kids would, like, wipe snot and boogers under their desk.  Yeah.  And sometimes if you were just kind of hanging out and maybe you had your hand on one leg  and you go to, like, I don't know, tap your foot, for some reason you touch the bottom  of the desk and feel just lumps under there. 
[00:14:30]  When a crusty one would fall off.  I still get skeeved out just thinking about it.  I have a confession.  God's honest truth.  I was a shock student, Anthony, back in the day.  A shock student.  And we'd be in some of these really boring, like, history classes and stuff.  Yeah.  And I was known.  And it got to the point where people would collect money because they couldn't believe  this was actually going on.  I started out as a goof.  And then, you know, how things spread around school.  And I wonder why I didn't start dating until I was, like, a senior in high school. 
[00:15:00]  So then they would start, you know, getting collections because they didn't believe it.  So I would do it.  And I would get my lunch money.  And what was this?  I would reach onto the desk, feel for a good one.  A good what?  Wad of gum that's been there for weeks, maybe years.  Who knows?  Usually the hard ones.  Oh, my God.  Scrape it out.  You weren't that kid.  I swear to God, I was.  And I would, yeah, pop it in my mouth for the enjoyment of everybody screaming and yelling 
[00:15:30]  as the teacher had his back to the class.  And then he would turn around wondering what the hell was going on.  Yeah, that was me.  That is really disgusting.  I was that kid.  Just for a little while.  It was a little stage I went through, Ant.  A little stage.  Yeah.  Were you ever just sitting somewhere and have a chunk of wax fall out of your ear?  What?  No.  Never.  Never.  Dan.  No.  Dan from Pennsylvania, I guess, has had that happen.  Thanks for having this discussion right as I was eating my yogurt. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yogurt, not a good thing to eat during this.  Sometimes if I'm sitting there and eating something and maybe it's got oregano in it  and the oregano kind of looks snotty, I have to take it out of the plate and hide it.  Really?  Yeah.  That doesn't bother me.  No, anything booger-like even.  So that way, now bringing it back, that's why I had to get rid of the couch.  Oh, yeah, the couch.  The booger was in there somewhere, couldn't be found.  So I couldn't sit, I couldn't recline, I couldn't lay down and not think of that booger. 
[00:16:30]  But if you couldn't find it-  It tasks me.  The booger tasks me.  Maybe the kid never had the booger on his finger.  You ever think of that?  What do you mean?  Because you couldn't find it that day.  He wiped it somewhere and it's somewhere.  Boogers don't just disappear, Opie.  It was somewhere in that couch.  Couldn't you have it professionally cleaned?  I mean-  If you couldn't find the booger, maybe it was in a cushion somewhere.  So you'd never see it.  Might have been able to have it cleaned.  It just had this booger stigma to it now that I can't, I just couldn't get rid of it. 
[00:17:00]  Does the new couch now have the plastic on it?  I haven't gotten the new couch yet.  I'm not getting it until next month, because it takes forever to get a couch.  Are you still using this couch?  No.  What is it?  We have no couch in our- I sit on a desk-  Why don't you just keep the old booger couch until you've got the new couch?  Oh, no.  Just throw a sheet or something over it at the worst.  Booger couch hauled away as trash.  Why didn't you put a sheet over it and just use it until that thing came?  And what's a sheet going to do?  What kind of booger protective qualities does a sheet have, Jimmy, that I don't know about? 
[00:17:30]  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  What kind of a booger shield does a sheet have?  You didn't drop anthrax on your couch.  It's just a yummy snack.  It was the-  Oh, God.  And you should have put the couch up on eBay.  Someone would have bought the Anthony Booger couch.  I did not want that couch in the house anymore.  It had to go.  You know how many other places he touched in your apartment with boogers on his fingers in your house?  Exactly.  And we were going around for about two days spraying Windex and Formula 405 and everything else on the walls and lights. 
[00:18:00]  Because they run around like they eat and then they have their greasy little hands and they touch everything.  I saw my beautiful big screen television.  And I've seen big screen TVs at people's houses that have kids.  It is just a mess of smeared little kid hands all over the place.  And I looked at my TV one day and the sun was hitting the screen right and I just saw this little handprint whack right on my screen. 
[00:18:30]  And I'm like, God damn it.  And threw the TV away?  No, because it wasn't Booger.  It was a TV.  And TVs aren't known for their absorbing qualities like a couch.  And hopefully you don't lay on it.  And I don't lay on it.  I just watch it.  So I had it.  But I had it, you know, with Windex and get that all cleaned off.  And I was just like, God, how do people have these little things running around their house?  Little, ugh.  Like Blair Witch.  Little handprints on the walls.  Turn around.  Stand in the corner. 
[00:19:00]  I'm going to kill them.  You're a lunatic.  I'm not a lunatic.  I'm a child hater.  Something is going on in that head of yours.  No, I need things my way.  The end of your life is going to be spending the Desert Inn in Vegas and the entire top floor having ice cream made especially for you.  What's wrong with a life like that?  The maids would have to touch things with a certain amount of tissues.  They couldn't open a can without five or six tissues.  So today, have you been on the road with this guy?  He's a take charge kind of guy.  Anthony's already changing into him on the road.  What? 
[00:19:30]  We see Anthony get his baggage, usually at the airport of the city we're staying in.  And then we kind of, if we're lucky, we get to see him for the broadcast.  And the rest of the broadcast, he's in his hotel room with the shades down.  Let me ask you, would you do this, and this is not even as gross as it sounds, but like in a public toilet when you lift the lid,  would you ever scrape your finger under some of the brown stuff under the toilet lid?  Oh, God!  And just sniff your finger. 
[00:20:00]  Stop it.  You know the crud that builds up on a public toilet, though, right?  Or any toilet.  Yes, I'm fully aware of this crud.  You know that kid took one of those boogers and put it right on your pillow?  Stop it!  Well, he did.  He was bouncing all over.  Antony, Antony, Antony, Antony.  Can't say your name.  He's too small.  Antony.  A little dirty.  Probably touched his little pee.  Like, you know, his kids pee and they touch their helmets.  Probably touched your pillow.  The pillow.  The pillow.  All right, now you're treading on a different area.  Or he scratched his little childish bum. 
[00:20:30]  Oh!  Stop it!  You know how they scratch their ass?  Like a baby chimp?  Yeah.  Or they're just always touching and wiping?  Itch it and touch Uncle Anthony's pillows.  Oh, oh, oh.  And how old is the kid?  I guess they're like seven, eight, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,  Well, you know the kid is wiping his own ass and, you know, a seven-year-old's not doing  a good job with that, so you've got to think there's, like, microscopic, you know, fecal  matter on his fingers.  I've disinfected the house.  Did you?  Disinfected.  And if all else fails, I'll be moving soon anyway. 
[00:21:00]  Did they use your soap?  I'm looking for, I know I just moved in, but I really am looking to move.  Why do you want to move?  Is there a booger in the garage somewhere?  What's the matter with you?  He wants to move because he realized people were actually in this house.  So his new goal is to find a house where it's going to be perfectly safe from out.  Pristine.  He's looking for new construction.  And nobody will ever visit me.  I won't let anyone in this house.  I can't wait for the day that Anthony shows up in a bubble costume.  Rolling through the door, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  I'm slowly but surely noticing you're changing.  A little bit, a little bit.  No guests.  No guests.  I might actually have like a cabana by the pool where people can stay that has to be bombed  every so often by an exterminator or something.  Well, they'll be doing the show.  You'll be actually in that room where the interns aren't known.  Yeah.  And no one can come in there.  And no one can come in there.  Reading the news.  I'm not.  I don't think I'm that crazy.  You have to put those big gloves on and reach through the wall to read the newspaper.  Oh, yeah.  You can have like when you work with nuclear stuff.  That's how Anthony will be reading the papers before the show. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  I have to reach into the studio here and grab this and go.  With my big bulky outbreak gloves.  Well, Anthony, let's see if this would bother you.  Let's go to Tom and.  All right.  It's Formula 409.  I mean, sorry, I was off a couple of numbers on my cleaning fluids.  What did you say?  408?  405, I think.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, the difference is 405 probably does nothing for booger or fecal removal.  That's right.  409 is the stuff you needed.  Let's say hi to Tom.  He's on the Cape.  Cape Cod, that is.  Tom? 
[00:22:30]  Hey, Ope and Sugar Tits.  Hi, Tom on the Cape.  Hey.  All right.  I work in a prison down on Cape Cod at Bonsville House of Correction.  And we have a child molester there.  And he has hep C, AIDS, and he has a colostomy back.  Oh, Jesus.  And he's an unruly inmate.  So, you know, every now and again when he gets a little fuss up, he starts throwing the stuff around.  They have to bring the move team in.  So they bring the move team in this one time. 
[00:23:00]  And instead of cuffing up and being escorted down a seg like a nice little lad, he decides to spray us all with it.  And out of a fantastic time, the shield guy gets it all over everybody.  It was good times all the way around.  A colostomy bag being sprayed at you.  He won the unlucky lottery.  That's hardcore.  What happened to him?  Um, well, let's just say he fell down.  Good.  And, uh, he broke stuff.  So, you know.  He broke stuff.  All right.  All right, guys. 
[00:23:30]  Punch it out.  Thank you, Tom.  You can't blast a bunch of correction officers with liquid shit and not expect to get a savage beating for us.  Some type of retribution.  What do you think they're going to do?  Laugh it off?  Oh, look.  You got some on you.  Yeah, all over my white shirt, you silly goose.  Yeah.  Oh, you.  Because, you know, colostomy bags probably got pulp in it.  It's not pure liquid.  Whoa.  It's like stew.  It hasn't gone through that mold.  That mold that is your intestine that kind of gives it that shape.  There's a fingernail in it.  In a starchy world, mired in imperfection. 
[00:24:00]  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel, but for some reason at this place, they put it, like, on the grill.  One man.  It's all about me, me, me.  You challenge the status quo.  They don't have a toaster?  That annoys me.  Navigating treacherous terrain.  There's crap all over it.  Like I'm seeing grease.  Confronting the unknown.  And there's something green on it, which could be a pepper or a booger.  It's awful.  The platoon of interns.  You sheep.  And military precision. 
[00:24:30]  Go, go, go.  Fix it.  The world will witness a revolution.  Bagel diva.  Coming soon.  Come on.  To a bakery near you.  Are you kidding?  NHL game, play-by-play on XM.

Here's Opie and Anthony when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific!  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:28:00]  No more of that, it's bad for you.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I'm the only one that didn't get to take a leak.  This break was so short,  no one's back from the break yet.  I guess Opie and Jimmy still in the bathroom.  And I was walking out, ready to take a leak.  I forgot, and a good thing,  I forgot the key to the men's room.  I figured it would be open,  like Jimmy or Opie would have left it open or something.  No.  So I walk up and I go back to get the key. 
[00:28:30]  And Eric tells me,  hey, we're back on the air.  Oh, wow.  So I don't get to take a leak.  No one's here in the studio.  He's like, you guys are back on the air.  Yeah.  So I have to run in still,  bladder full of urine.  Well, Opie just,  we were just chatting in the bathroom,  talking about my dump Chicago flight.  He's like,  do you think I got time to take a dump?  Oh, no.  Right now.  He's taking a dump in there?  Stupid is on the ball.  So I waited for a couple of seconds  so I felt like he settled in  and I just shut the lights off  and walked out of the bathroom.  Because that's what you do.  So I'm hoping he's right now duck walking 
[00:29:00]  with a log hanging out  trying to get the lights back on.  Yesterday we all went to the bathroom together,  as we sometimes do.  And Jimmy, notorious for turning the lights out  when we're in there.  Credit where it's due.  It's a great gag.  That's hilarious.  The bathrooms are pitch black in buildings.  You know, rarely have a window in there.  That thing can open in five degree weather.  So I'm just about done  and the light goes out.  But I'm used to it.  But I didn't know there was anybody else in there  and there was some guy just from the building  and he's sitting in the stall 
[00:29:30]  and you just hear,  hey, turn the light back on!  There he is just dumping in the dark.  When I was doing Last Comic Standing in New York,  we were doing the semifinals.  I went into the bathroom  and I got somebody so good.  That was shot in a hotel  on like 50-something street,  the Hudson Hotel.  And I got this,  I shut the lights off in the men's room  and I walked out  and this guy was screaming in the hotel.  It was like a big lobby.  Who the fuck turned off the lights?  Somebody turned off the fucking lights! 
[00:30:00]  He was as angry  as I've ever seen anybody about anything.  And there's like a bunch of people in the hallway.  He was screaming.  Dude, I got the aftermath though.  So I'm in the stall dumping  and there's another guy dumping  and you turn off the light.  Just now?  Yeah, I know the gag  and I'm just like,  ugh, who cares?  Because he's done it a million times, right?  This guy obviously was reading like,  it had to be the New York Times  because all you hear is,  give me the papers.  Give me the papers.  I need the papers. 
[00:30:30]  I don't want to mess up.  Papers, Eva.  I have nowhere to slam this.  But basically all you hear is,  son!  Slams the paper down.  You hear a belt.  And then he waddles out.  Oh, that clanking of the dump belt.  He waddles out of the stall  and he, yeah, he doesn't have the,  the belt is, yeah, whatever.  Clanging.  Clanging, thank you.  And he clangs past me,  turns the light on,  and goes back  and then you hear,  with the paper  as he goes back into position. 
[00:31:00]  Well, you know when he sat back down  and his cheeks opened up,  it was probably like  chewed bubble gum  because you know he didn't wipe,  he just jumped up.  He couldn't do the duck walk  all the way over to the light switch.  It was really funny  because I'm like,  ah, whatever.  Just sit there and take it,  doody boy.  Annoying.  Good thing it wasn't Ben.  And then,  and then stupid stalker Patty's  outside the studio.  You know,  you're back on the radio  and they're talking about you.  You're back on the,  I think you'd need  to be back in the studio. 
[00:31:30]  I think Anthony  could handle it by himself.  Yeah,  I could handle it  if I didn't have to piss so badly.  I went up,  I went up to go to the bathroom  and I forgot the key,  which is a good thing  or all three of us  would have been in there  and nobody would have been here  to return to the program.  It'd be funny if we came back  and it was the Eric and Derek show  and they wouldn't let us in.  All of a sudden,  it was a big hit.  Ah!  Great story for E.T.  We're out of a job.  This is G. Gordon Liddy  and you're listening to the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  Billy! 
[00:32:00]  Yaboo!  There he is.  Opie and Anthony  and Jim Norton,  big fans of Billy West.  How are you, sir?  I know who you guys are.  I know everything about you.  Is that good or bad?  Men.  Men.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  I made it with a woman.  Alert the men.  Billy West.  The voice of everything.  Not everything.  No, you jumped into just about everything.  I'm amazed.  Didn't you wind up getting Bugs Bunny's gig? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, I did that for 10 years.  Jesus Christ.  The Warner Brothers gig.  Yeah, the Warner Brothers gig.  I did Space Jam and I did Bugs and Elmer Fudd.  And then Ren and Stimpy?  Yeah.  You, of course, were doing Stimpy, but I guess who John K was doing Ren?  Yeah, and then he'd get fired.  And then he got fired from his own show.  But I was the original guy who was supposed to do both.  I was given a tape with what they wanted for both voices.  Uh-huh.  And I did the original demo. 
[00:33:00]  And that's what sold the show over at Nickelodeon.  So, I mean, everybody likes to fantasize, you know, that I just flew in there and, you know, grabbed up everything.  And it's like, I didn't give a fat frog's ass who did the other voice.  I really didn't.  Yeah, because the Stimpy voice was great, of course.  Hey, Ren, will you button me?  You shit up, you fool.  I'll just kill you.  Yeah.  And then you ended up all over Nickelodeon.  Yeah.  And, man, the Honey Nuts Cheerio guy. 
[00:33:30]  How did you get so much work so fast?  I think I kind of had, from being on the radio in Manhattan, I think I had kind of an electronic business card, you know,  because everybody on Madison Avenue listens to everybody who's on the radio.  Howie.  You know, and I was one of those guys.  I was in that mindset.  Think about it, you know.  Like, when you were starting out, you just wanted to be flavor of the month.  Twelve times a year.  Right.  You know what I mean?  That's how I went in there, like a Terminator.  Yeah, I mean, you pretty much changed Howard's show. 
[00:34:00]  It took on a whole other direction.  Yeah.  You were a talent on there that brought it up to another level.  Well, I was facilitated in different ways.  You know, like they'd get me going on a certain premise, or they'd say, hey, try this tomorrow.  And then, you know, of course, Jackie was the million-dollar man.  I mean, he used to, you know, he'd hand me something that was, like, worth a million dollars in comedy dollars.  You know what I mean? 
[00:34:30]  It was, uh, that was like the golden age of Stern's show, uh, with Jackie and you there.  Some of the stuff.  I, you know, it's like, I haven't listened in an awful long time.  I'm a big fan of, like, AM radio.  Right.  And I listen to, uh, you know, the liberal talk shows that are starting to flourish in the face of all that other right-wing crap, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, both sides can be pretty entertaining, though, when they really go off.  Yeah.  But there's, um, there's this thing that, you know, over the years, everybody was trying to, you know, conjure up, like, what must have happened over there when I left. 
[00:35:00]  And I used to read the post, and I used to go, I don't remember this asshole being in the room when I said these things and did them.  Really?  You know, and everybody's an expert.  Here's what happened.  Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of...  Billy went in there one day, and he's ungrateful, and then, you know, he did, he did, he did, he did.  Yeah, there was a lot of controversy as to why you left, because, uh, you definitely were a shining star on that show.  Some of the most memorable things that came out of Howard's show was, uh, Billy West, the Marge shot stuff. 
[00:35:30]  The Marge shot thing.  I used to listen every morning when I was working, and, uh, when I was actually working for a living in construction.  And the Marge shot thing, the fucking Woodstock thing was, uh, probably one of the funniest things that was ever done.  Allison Steele doing the voiceover, and you doing Larry Fine.  Well, Larry was the basis for, uh, Stimpy's voice. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Stimpy.  And no one did Larry fucking...  Like a depressed old Jewish guy, so we had to catch him up, you know?  No one did Larry Fine.  It was, and it was a dead-on Larry Fine.  It's like, God damn.  I thought that was so sublime, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's like, uh...  And then putting him totally out of context into Woodstock was, that, that bit was fantastic.  Everything out of context with the Stooges is funny.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like, hey, Mo, I broke your Pesach dishes.  Oh, that's nothing of it, kid.  Why, you imbecile? 
[00:36:30]  This is the meat, and this is the dairy.  Ow, ow, ow.  Hey, you missed one.  No, I didn't.  God damn it.  They're talking about them, yeah.  Wait a minute.  Is that Yiddish for go take a shit in the ocean?  Oh, a wandering Jew, eh?  Well, get wandering.  You must have just grown up sitting in front of the television forever.  But you know what?  I was right.  My mother thought that they were idiots.  Yeah.  Stooges, she said, how can you watch those awful men? 
[00:37:00]  And look, I thought Mo was a genius, but I didn't know why.  And then believe it or not, he and Albert Einstein had a lot and had something in common.  I know you won't believe this, but it's true.  Mo actually explained E equals MC squared, the theory, what do you call it, theory of relativity.  Yeah.  When he said, we ain't getting no place fast.  And I said, oh my God, it's true.  He has a link to Albert Einstein.  Except Mo said it where I could understand it, you know. 
[00:37:30]  Did you grow up on that, though, watching a lot of cartoons, Mel Blanc?  Oh, sure, sure.  I watched it all and wondered, how the hell can someone do this?  Because he wasn't just a collection of witty little voices.  That guy was the best damn actor.  Yeah.  You know, and I know, I think Anthony does voices, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony does amazing voices.  It's just, you know, watching, it's a lifetime of watching a lot of television and being a minor bird.  Yeah, create your own characters, though, because Impressionist, it is my feeling on it. 
[00:38:00]  It's like, you know, we all wanted to be like Rich Little or Frank Gorshin or the other guy there, David Fry.  Yeah.  And one day we woke up in an America that didn't give a fuck about Impressionists.  Yeah, true.  You know what I mean?  So as soon as I started doing, like, original characters, all of a sudden it was like, wow, look at that.  You know, and I felt like none of my things that I could ever come up with could measure up to what Mel Blanc did and that.  But that's not the point.  You can't be the next Mel Blanc by doing Mel Blanc's voices. 
[00:38:30]  No.  You know, you've got to be like the best you.  Yeah, that was amazing.  He came up with all of them and so many of them, you know, and they were so different.  It wasn't like, oh, you could tell this is the same guy doing this voice or that voice.  Yeah.  Well, he inspired me to try to be as diverse as possible, you know, like, gosh, like on Futurama.  Yeah.  He tried to split it up, you know, to be like Zap Brannigan, you know, this is Zap Brannigan,  master of time and space and everything in between. 
[00:39:00]  And, oh, yeah, winner of this year's Modesty Award.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was based on all the big dumb announcers I came up with who loved far and away above everything else,  the sound of their own voice.  They keep their balls in the wheelbarrow.  You know, it's like trying to make eight-syllable words out of one.  Yeah.  Coming to the Worcester Centrum, meh.  Now, back to the Howard thing, though.  What actually did happen, because you guys were just riding a rocket ship, 
[00:39:30]  and then to have what I see, I don't know how modest you are,  but what I see was a huge part of that show just disappear from it.  I wasn't really aware of that until years later I started reading posts, you know,  and it was like, hey, I'm saying it's almost ten years and people are still going back and forth about this.  Like, what the heck?  And, you know, I mean, I've always said that I thought Howard was the greatest,  and I never blamed him for my problems with management at K-Rock when I wanted a raise, you know what I mean? 
[00:40:00]  I mean, they just stopped returning my solicitor's phone call, so I said to my son.  How could they not give you a raise?  I don't know.  Look, you know, I mean.  This business is filled with guys that are doing radio that just stink.  And then every once in a while there's a talent that comes along like a Billy West.  You've got to take care of them.  Well, I mean, they used to have these guys propped up there like Scott and Todd and this and Franny and Zooey and Ricky and Zicky.  Yeah.  You know, and I say, these guys got that certain nothing, don't they? 
[00:40:30]  No shit.  You know, and I'm going, how good do you have to frickin' be, you know, to get some money?  And it's like, not everybody wants to live in a sewer.  Right.  I'm not calling New York a sewer, but you've got to have money to live there and stay away from the sewer.  And it's ridiculous there.  And they just stopped returning my lawyer's phone call.  So I said to myself, hey, you know what, I'm not a victim.  I just went into Howard to say I'm leaving and that I respected him and I loved him and I thanked him for the time there. 
[00:41:00]  And, you know, for the first time in 12 years, I didn't know where I was going because I worked in Boston.  Yeah.  I'm not trying to make any, you know, battle here or anything.  Oh, no, no, no.  Did he go to bat for you?  I mean, that's.  See, I have no idea, but I never expected anything from anybody.  I just said.  Yeah, I know you don't expect anything, but Jesus Christ.  I mean, not getting back to me was a clear sign that said, you know, well, you're not that valuable.  So I didn't blame anybody or get mad or bitter.  I just said, well, the chance of making real big money here will never happen if I can't do a raise. 
[00:41:30]  That's just amazing.  Well, as far as the money goes, I'm sure you showed them, but, you know, I mean.  You know what it is?  I'm like the nicest guy.  I'm the most like, you know, like, I don't know what you call it, sort of a reticent guy  when it comes to asking for money.  And I realize you've got to be like fucking Tony Soprano or something nowadays.  Goddamn.  I used to be the same fucking way.  No shit.  I was just in there.  It was.  You fucking shut the roll. 
[00:42:00]  I want to fucking raise.  You understand how fucking hard it is to live in New Jersey with no fucking money?  This is the last fucking Sunday dinner I ever have at this house.  There's a time you go through.  It always sounds like he's ready to cry.  You know, Tony, Tony, you were never very good at athletics.  What the fuck are you going to say that for, Uncle Jones?  What's the matter with you?  There's a time you go through where you're just kind of happy to be there.  Yeah, I know.  And the money thing definitely is not even an issue. 
[00:42:30]  But then when you realize, you know, your car is falling apart and you've got to make your bills,  you kind of want to at least be compensated for what you're doing and the capacity that you're doing.  Can I tell you this?  Billy West is a very inspirational phone call.  I hope you all realize that.  Absolutely.  Absolutely, Jimmy.  This is coming soon.  No, no.  I guess I'm here to teach lessons and whatever.  Yeah.  You know, for aspiring radio people, it's, you know, just, like, eat the shit sandwich for a while, 
[00:43:00]  but don't leave that as your precedent, you know.  You're not going to say it, but it's pretty obvious that someone's ego got in the way and it's too bad.  I really don't know.  All I know is that.  Because you were doing some great, great things.  And we're in radio.  Like, if someone like you came along, holy shit, we'd make sure you were taken care of.  Are you kidding me?  There were guys, sidekicks, that just did so much better than I did.  But I didn't think of myself as a sidekick.  I just thought of myself as a utility infielder.  But I was good at it. 
[00:43:30]  And, you know, this weird soap opera kicked off about two months ago when some shitfuck took a quote of mine off my website  and injected his own editorial.  What was that quote?  What was the quote?  That I was bitter about Stern.  And then he lobbed it into the New York Post as if he had talked to me.  And he put that I was bitter in there.  And it went to Richard Johnson.  And because of one scavenger, I wound up looking like a bag of dumb remarks.  Yeah, that same asshole has printed a lot of bullshit.  But, I mean, how can you get away with that? 
[00:44:00]  Like, taking something that you read somewhere and saying that they told it to you and that he sounded this or that way.  You're talking about Chauncey Hayden who just makes shit up?  Yeah.  I'm a decent guy.  You know, I gave everything my all.  Yeah.  Millions of people happy for over a decade.  And still, no matter what the fuck you do, there will always be like 13 and a half people who hate you for some reason.  Hey, Billy, like I said, that was the golden age of that show.  And, you know, that was the you can't miss a day because you guys had something there and it was amazing. 
[00:44:30]  I listened to the old tapes and I'm like going, oh, my God.  I don't even remember saying that.  All I knew was that I'd come out of there just kind of like questioning myself.  Like, what the fuck did you just say?  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes you listen to...  Most people got it.  People are smart.  They got it.  Yeah.  Would you ever go back to radio?  No, I think for guys like you, you know, you're probably an anomaly.  You probably get a lot of money because you hung in there and, you know, you made it, you know? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, we're one of the lucky shows.  They're not going to bring a lot of radio shows to satellite, so we're lucky.  Not high profile anyway, besides, you know, Howard.  I mean...  I want a show.  You want a show?  That's right.  We got Saturday night here for you.  Oh, yeah?  It's at 12 midnight.  We should talk.  Yeah, I know.  We could give you some time.  No problem.  I'd have a fun time, you know?  The great thing is you disappeared off of Howard's show, but then you just popped up everywhere  doing voiceover work.  Well, actually, I guess in this weird zen way, I have them to thank for just, you know, 
[00:45:30]  refusing to...  Pay you.  ...up the ante because, you know, I really...  I went to nothing.  I left and went to nothing.  That's against all what your uncles told you.  Right.  Right.  We stupid.  Have something to back it up before you leave, you asshole.  Gotta make sure you got something lined up.  Yep.  You know, and then I have that work ethic because it was installed in me, you know, because  the immigrant mentality, you know...  Yeah.  You had a chance to work 18 hours a day and you didn't do it?  The fuck is wrong with you? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, and then all of a sudden you start hearing the Honey Nut Cheerio be, and I'm like, I  think that's Billy West.  Oh, yeah.  And then it just...  Honey Nut Cheerios, it's irresistible.  It's just...  There you go.  I'm a recycler.  I believe in recycling, you know, because I'm big on that with garbage and stuff.  Yeah.  But I used that voice on that show, Doug.  Right.  That was Nickelodeon Doug, and Doug was a painfully shy 11-and-a-half-year-old, and this is my 
[00:46:30]  dog pork chop, and...  And just the cash rolls in.  Can you hear a microphone, loser?  Hey, this is Roger Klotz, and I'm calling him the coolest guy on radio, and I got to  roll your radio too.  What do you think about that?  He says the same voice.  And the cash rolls in.  That's great.  Well, you know what?  I got to tell you.  Radio is like kind of...  You're a buyout, basically.  I know I always was, because you don't really own anything, you know, that you did, and  you can't get residuals on it, so it's kind of a license to print money. 
[00:47:00]  And I think I was one of these guys that just said, wow, you know, residuals is what  keeps people alive out here.  Yep.  You know, you don't hear from Terry Hatcher for years, and all of a sudden, you know,  bang, but she had to live somehow, and she got all those Superman residuals.  Oh, I do a Terry Hatcher impression.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Do these bones make me look fat? 
[00:47:30]  You know, I just, I don't know, I love the residual thing, and I explained it to my mom's  boyfriend.  He's an ex-firefighter, retired firefighter in Boston.  And one day I came over there, and he's like, I want to know about show business.  He wants to know about everything about show business.  He thinks I'm like the president of show business.  Show business, yeah.  He's not as close as anybody will ever get in that block.  But he would say, you know, I've got to ask you, Bill, what do you think is the best 
[00:48:00]  part of your job?  Is it the people you work with?  Is it the hours?  You know, what is the best part of your job?  And I said, well, Walter, imagine you got on your robe and your slippers, and you got  on the mailbox, and, you know, in it there's a check for a fire you fought in 1973.  And he just looked at me, and he goes, gotcha.  I mean, it's still out.  It's still out.  It didn't come back.  He did a really good job.  You should be getting residuals for it. 
[00:48:30]  That's a great way to put it.  Do you get really, really small paychecks in there as well, like for $2.50, some dumb  little obscure thing you did?  Yeah, it's not like savings bonds, you know?  The more time goes on, the less they, you know, are valued.  And like the residuals just kind of wear down to nothing.  But that's okay, because, I mean, I get a work ethic.  I go out every single day, and if I'm not doing a gig, I'll be auditioning, because if  you want to work, you've got to audition.  What's the latest thing you've done, or that is coming out? 
[00:49:00]  I recorded a pilot for television for George of the Jungle, kind of a different take on  it.  I've done them a million pilots.  See, they don't make cartoon shows anymore.  They just make a whole mess of pilots, and if one of them, or two of them, has emotional  resonance, then they'll make a show out of it.  Really?  Yeah, it's a whole part of this trying to ensure success thing that they don't have  quite down out here in stupid wood.  So you're also, well, Futurama, is that still going? 
[00:49:30]  Yes, every place in the world, if you don't mind me telling you.  I've got all this cool meat hanging off my face.  Don't worry, get me a sandwich from the dumpster, and leave my maggots on it.  And I did, Professor Farnsworth, yeah.  Oh, good news, everyone, bad news. 
[00:50:00]  That show, that's fantastic, man.  I think there was one more in there, but I can't remember.  That was my favorite show.  That was hysterical.  Yeah.  You've got to do bugs before you leave, man.  Well, let's see.  What did I get from Warner Brothers for doing that picture?  Oh, I got a million.  And I got it out of them one carrot at a time, Doc.  That must have been something, though.  All of a sudden, you're the voice of Bugs Bunny and the Warner Brothers characters. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, it was great when every idiot that walked down the hallway pops their head in the door  while you're doing it and go, he's too much of a wise guy.  And then another person will swing by 20 minutes later and pop their head in the door and he  goes, he's too Jewish.  Oh, shit.  And then another idiot would come in and go, where's the tough guy?  You know?  Yeah, that's got to be rough because everybody is so familiar with that voice.  But, I mean, we're in radio.  We came from radio.  And our world was a sonic world more than visual. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Theater of the mind.  These people don't think like that.  They just have their own little perception of which ones they saw.  I mean, Bugs had a million incarnations depending on the director.  Which is, they're putting that out, too, Warner Brothers home video.  Oh, really?  Triple threat of classic animation.  Yeah, it's the Looney Tunes Golden Collection.  And I did some commentary on it.  And it's got, like, all the best stuff on it and beautiful, pristine.  You know, because it's so funny.  We think that the Warner Brothers cartoons are playing constantly like when we were kids. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  But they're not.  And I think there's a whole mess of kids that are, like, six and up now that don't really  know who they are.  Yeah, not a clue.  No, and you know what?  Cartoons were better then.  I mean, it never occurred to me to burn down my own house.  No, I know.  When I was seven.  Yeah, for some reason they decided that some character, some animated animal hitting another  one with a frying pan, was going to get kids to do that.  So they had to stop doing it. 
[00:52:00]  It got so bad in the 70s that there was this woman, Peggy Cher, in action for children's  television.  And she had scenes deleted from Josie and the Pussycat because one of the girls threw  her cat in a bowl of spaghetti.  And it was deemed very aggressive and very needless, so they cut out the scene because  they thought kids would throw their cat in a bowl of spaghetti.  I remember watching edited Wabbit Season, Duck Season, where they wouldn't show Elmer shooting  Daffy in the face with the gun.  And they cut to some freeze frame of bugs looking out of his hole and then would cut 
[00:52:30]  back to Daffy with his bill on his head.  It's like, what the fuck?  Oh, wow, I remember that.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, that's the worst thing you can do.  I mean, it's not even like colorizing a movie.  That, you've got a color and black and white button on your TV set.  Yeah, let's take the joke right out of the cartoon.  At that point, don't...  Watch these politically correct surgeries of that stuff.  Yeah, at that point, you should just not air it anymore.  Yeah, if you're going to butcher like that, don't air it. 
[00:53:00]  You know what it is?  Research and focus groups and all that other crap doesn't work.  It's a formula that was created by the business so that no one person is responsible for the  decision to do something.  Yeah.  You know, they can say, hey, we did our research, we did the focus groups, and it just, you  know, it failed.  And then they invent new words for failure like deferred success.  Deferred success.  Yeah, that's the new one I heard out of Washington.  That's a great one.  I love that one.  I was a deferred success for quite a while.  I used to play music and kind of a bum, really. 
[00:53:30]  So many years went by where cartoons and animation just sucked.  Oh, yeah.  And then, like, and were just made for the smallest of children, you know?  No more adults really watching it like we did growing up.  I still, you know, watched Bugs Bunny through my 20s and 30s and everything.  Yeah, you did.  And then, uh...  I doubt if you ever did anything like what was going on in those things.  You realize that this is...  There are real, live people that are responsible for the silly stuff that's going on. 
[00:54:00]  And you're more fascinated by that than the idea of how to find a new way to torture somebody.  Yeah, it had nothing to do with that.  You didn't do it.  It was just entertaining.  It was funny.  You know, when kids started doing stuff, after we cut the good stuff out of cartoons and we banished, you know, characters that had cigars and all of that crap, it started going into Sesame Street, which I kind of loved.  I thought it was great whenever I got to see it.  But I didn't...  I wasn't around in the 70s watching TV. 
[00:54:30]  I was playing music.  Yeah.  So, um...  Goddamn hippie.  As soon as they started showing this Rainbow Brite and My Little Pony...  Oh, it was all that crap.  ...and Hammer Man and all that other shit.  Yeah.  Um, and you know what happened?  It's like that generation wound up to do drive-by shootings.  Yeah.  And killing their own kids.  I mean, the phenomena swept the country.  And I'm going, yeah, because you've got to get your rocks off on something that's just out of your mind crazy on television.  Because then out of nowhere came, like, Beavis and Butthead and Ren and Stimpy, and all of a sudden adults could watch cartoons again and laugh their asses off. 
[00:55:00]  Well, you know what I liked so much about that time is that Ren and Stimpy, in no way...  Felt like the Simpsons, or looked like it.  And Beavis and Butthead, in no way, took any dynamic from Ren and Stimpy or the Simpsons.  No, and it was...  It was a really beautiful, stand-alone cartoon.  It had a 50s look to it, almost.  Yeah, kind of beatnik-y.  Yeah, yeah, Ren and Stimpy.  Well, I remember beatniks because I'm 54 years old. 
[00:55:30]  And it just had a great look and feel to it.  And the shock value out of a cartoon was every episode was amazing like that.  A lot of fun to watch.  Yeah, you know, there's more stuff coming, but I think computer is going to be the place to go.  And I think, well, satellite radio is like the Wild West, ain't it, for you guys?  Yeah, absolutely.  So fucking lootly.  Every day we're trying to figure this thing out.  There's no law here.  That's right.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  You guys, I know you bounced around and you did the drill and everything, but there's, like, I talk to a lot of these young, young disc jockeys, you know, that are like, their voices crack when they're talking. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  You know, this is Booger with you.  You know, and I talk to these guys and say, we did everything because of you.  And I'm going, wow, you know, this is weird.  Like, Private Parts was a training film for these guys.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And it's like, you know, I always thought of Howard as, like, the first guy that ever went to Acapulco, you know? 
[00:56:30]  The first guy to ever go to Acapulco didn't have a good time.  You know what I mean?  He was like, you know, the bugs and the cracking the bushes open with a machete and, you know, getting bit by snakes and stuff.  And then 200 years later, there's a bunch of these young guys sitting on a beach in a lounge chair going, hi, I'm Booger.  You know.  I invented Acapulco, Robin.  The walls were broken down until now, which is this new frontier, which I'm totally fascinated by. 
[00:57:00]  I think it's great.  Yeah, it's a blast.  Here's a question, because I can't do any impressions at all.  Of all the, like, ones you do, like, what's the one that's, like, the one that you're, like, fucking, I'm glad I can do that one?  Like, the most obscure or, like, hardest one?  Um, it depends on, you could take any voice and put it in the most absurd situation.  And I don't mean, like, the 80s stand-up comedy routine, like, uh, you know, Jack Nicholson's dog.  And it might sound something like this.  You know, or, uh, you know, that kind of stuff. 
[00:57:30]  I mean, I liked when you took somebody and put them in, it's like, the comedians, the old comedians used to hate the young comedians because they claimed these guys needed to work blue to be funny.  Meanwhile, those old guys were the dirtiest bastards in the world, if you ever hear outtakes and roasts and stuff.  You know, and I used to say, man, it would be just so funny, I'd give anything to go back and see, like, George Dice Burns.  You know?  So I'm standing in the bank line with my tongue up this chick's ass. 
[00:58:00]  What else is that to do?  Oh, George.  Never mind, Gracie.  Or, uh, you know, I took in the old days.  I loved Bob Hope.  Yeah.  Hey, hi.  Hey, this is Bob Big Up from Heaven Hope.  Hey, how about that death?  Hey, this is Bob.  Who?  You know, they say that death is just a new beginning.  Hey, it might be a new beginning, but I still look like the old ending. 
[00:58:30]  I still carry my medical alert bracelet in case I fall down a flight of clouds.  Hey, how about that glaucoma?  You're not screaming at coffee.  Squeeze it right in there, yeah.  Keep the motor running, boys.  These jokes are, uh, kind of ballin'.  Hey, speaking of radio, a lot of people are calling in saying you do a great Grish man.  Oh, well, yeah.  You know, he was one of those guys that kind of had that voice that Zap Brannigan wound up doing. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  And the thing is, is I knew Phil Hartman before he died.  He was really cool.  When I was still in New York and I was up to nothing, you know, I just left, um, radio and I get this phone call.  My wife got the call and I'm on my way home out of the belly of the beast and I hear the gates clang shut behind me.  And my wife calls me and says, you won't believe who I was talking to for like an hour.  I said, who?  She said, Phil Hartman.  He went on and on about how much he liked your stuff and how much he loved, you know. 
[00:59:30]  And I said, hey, honey, you know, I know so many people that are capable of pulling an elaborate joke like that.  And then I got the phone number.  I called him back and it was him.  Wow.  And he says, you know, when are you going to come out to Hollywood?  You know?  Yeah.  So I'm like, geez, I don't know.  I really don't.  I had no, nothing planned to tell you the truth.  But he was the nicest guy, the most generous guy as an actor and, you know, as a person who would like talk to you. 
[01:00:00]  You know, you didn't get that weird vibe from him.  It's so odd to have, because that's all I've heard about him are good things.  You never heard, you got like, I was a prick.  And to have him have to fucking go out like that was awful.  Oh, I know.  And the thing was, is Philip J. Fry on Futurama was named after Phil Hartman.  Really?  Yeah.  And Zap Brannigan was going to be done by Phil Hartman.  So when people hear that, they go, oh, that's Billy doing Phil Hartman.  But you know what?  We talked about all that stuff before Futurama. 
[01:00:30]  And we both had that love of the big, dumb announcers, you know.  Yeah.  25, 30, 35 years ago.  Yeah, he used to do that.  You know, now kids hear those voices and they assume they're being lied to.  You know, hey, everybody.  One of the best SNL bits he was ever in was the one where he played the doctor back in the 50s.  They were all smoking cigarettes.  Oh, yeah.  And tells the woman, you have lung fever.  Yeah, smoke these. 
[01:01:00]  You have lung fever.  Oh, my God.  Lung disease.  That reminded me of the avian flu pandemic.  You know, which I don't believe.  Of course not.  A crock, you know.  60-something people.  I'm going to come along and turn your lungs into chip dip.  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  Yeah, 60-some-odd people have died worldwide and we're supposed to start panicking now.  Yeah, really.  It hasn't killed anybody in Europe.  Yeah.  And, you know, the terror helicopters are flying around all night here in L.A. 
[01:01:30]  Terror.  There's a lot of terror.  There's just nothing but terror.  And I believe in an America where a man can come home after a hard day's work and be able to put food on his family.  And Rumsfeld's just as much of a dummy.  He's like, you know, things are more like they are now than they've ever been before.  What?  God damn. 
[01:02:00]  And Karl Rove.  You can't see, but I've got both hands in front of my face.  And I'm mimicking a blowjob, Karl Rove.  Billy, man, thanks for checking in.  Oh, my pleasure.  I got a website.  I don't know if you guys ever went on it.  Did you have to wrangle it from somebody?  Somebody tried to buy it and they were offering something and they were a carpet company.  You know, I don't get that.  What is this, a new claim jumping? 
[01:02:30]  That's exactly what it is.  It's like, you know, my claim.  Someone comes up with a mule and a pickaxe and sits on your fucking name.  Yeah, one day I was trying my 40 acres and a mule.  And I didn't get nothing.  So I'm going over to 7-Eleven and I'm going to get me a pussy book.  And then I'm going to get me a slurpee.  Hey, Billy.  Pussy book is hot and slurpee is cold.  Together they form weather.  Hey, Billy, you still do Marge shot or what? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, but that thing polarizes people, you know.  It certainly does.  That's a good way to put it, polarizes.  I mean, even people who think it's funny in a certain situation try to act like, oh, my God, did you hear that?  And everybody pretty much got it, you know.  I mean, this is a grotesque send-up of a totally racist woman.  Right.  I'm not racist.  I mean, you know, I'm really not.  Who didn't get that, though, you know?  And we're doing this grotesque send-up of this woman, you know, like, who would barge into the show and go, 
[01:03:30]  80% of U.S. crime is committed by coloreds.  All right, all right, Mrs. Johnson.  I'm sorry, I meant niggas.  And then some white guy would call in and go,  I think what you're doing is just really terrible.  And you're cutting away at the beautiful mosaic, which is New York.  And it's people like you.  I mean, your parents must be really proddy.  And I'd be like, eh, shitty. 
[01:04:00]  You know, and then a black guy would call in and go, I know that's Billy West.  Yeah.  I know that's Billy West.  You know, laughing his bajongas off.  Yeah, some people just didn't understand.  You know, that's it.  It's like a white guy, a sensitive white guy that thinks he's going to represent, like, the African-American community.  Yeah.  I love that.  And they're laughing their asses off.  They don't think they can't say anything on their own.  Yeah, some people don't understand that it's, you know, a joke of, you know,  you're doing an impersonation, over-the-top impersonation of this woman who is known for saying some pretty awful things. 
[01:04:30]  She didn't say really rank things.  I was, like, blown away by the stuff that she said.  I don't know what it is about radio.  When you're on TV or you're an actor in a movie, you could play the most heinous character, and it's fine.  They never say, like, wow, you're some racist when you were playing that part, you know.  But then on the radio, if you do some kind of character, people call up,  and it's like you were just standing on a soapbox outside in the street blurting this shit out.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, they attack soap opera characters because people are fanatics.  You know, they really believe that this guy on the show is, like, you know, a double indemnity murderer or something,  and they go up to them in the stores and go, how could you?  You know, it's just weird.  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah, but, I mean, it's all to be fun, you know.  I mean, we don't – we're not like the government, you know.  We're not promoting a culture of death and destruction and torture.  You know, we represent, like, love and laughter and, you know, joy of some type. 
[01:05:30]  And I know that things get rough, but, I mean, it's the modern age.  We're not saying anything that anybody on the street everywhere USA or the world, you know, isn't saying.  Right.  Never.  Yeah.  I mean, it's hard to reinvent language as much as they try, though, with that deferred success shit.  Billy, I would have given you more money, but I'm out in the Hamptons.  You're what?  Tell him. 
[01:06:00]  Tell him, Robin.  Oh, yeah.  I wanted to pay you more, but I've got to buy a house on the Hamptons.  I don't know.  He didn't – you know, I had no idea, like, where he was on all that stuff.  But out here, it's really bad.  It's so snobby.  When I first got here, I'd go to my first Hollywood party, and I figured,  I'm going to make sure I have some $100 bills on me.  Yeah.  You know, so when I go to buy a Red Bull –  Pull that out.  I was like, oh, hey, look at this guy.  And I hand the guy $100, and he goes, ooh, do you have anything bigger? 
[01:06:30]  So you've got to have money somehow.  Absolutely.  Billy –  I really appreciate it, you guys.  Great, man.  I've followed your career, and I'm glad I got to talk to you.  If you're in New York, pop in.  Yes, I do.  Love to have you on here live.  How about that?  All right.  Cool, man.  All right.  Take it easy.  All right.  There he goes, Billy West.  Thanks, Billy.  Bye.  That was great.  Opie and Anthony.  I've been gangbanging, killing, skidding, robbing, motherfuckers.

Where there's smoke, there's money.  I'm Chris Whitting with the Success Journal.  Pat was a college physics major.  His career plans were up in the air, 
[01:08:00]  until the day when he sat in his room listening to music.  Suddenly, his audio gear exploded in a cloud of smoke.  To Pat, it was a sign.  Either play softer music that didn't strain his stereo,  or design a better power supply for his audio gear.  He decided to stick with rock and roll,  and build quality audio parts.  With a family loan, Pat was soon rocking.  Soon, companies worldwide were buying his goods. 
[01:08:30]  If you own audio gear,  chances are it contains a power supply  from Pat Vinciarelli's Vicor Corporation.  Pat's making sweet music.  His company's now on NASDAQ,  and earns $200 million a year.  With the Success Journal, I'm Chris Whitting.  60-20 Sports.  Our show's about generational differences in sports.

This is a great story. 
[01:10:30]  Ben is giving a thumbs up.  Remember...  What's your fault on the questioning?  Which one?  From the fugitives?  Well, remember Stephanie?  Who...  I don't know if she's still producing,  but she produced for O'Reilly?  Yeah, we talked about her.  And we've talked about her over the years,  but basically she was a producer for O'Reilly, right?  Yeah.  And they were trying to get Anthony and I  on O'Reilly's show for a long time,  and they were using this girl, Stephanie.  Like, she was coming into our show,  interviewing us,  talking to us,  trying to convince us  this would be a good thing.  Remember she used to hang out 
[01:11:00]  in the studio with us, Anthony, right?  All this stuff.  And we really got to know her, right?  We were in a conference room with her.  She sat us down,  face-to-face meeting,  in the studio,  watching the show,  getting the feel of the show,  going back to Fox,  trying to work out this whole deal  for the O'Reilly people, right?  So I used to stay in the city at this point,  and I went down to where Ben was living at the time,  and we went and had a few drinks, okay?  And she happened to be at one of the bars...  We ran into her, yeah.  We ran into Stephanie down there, right? 
[01:11:30]  Uh-huh.  She's smoking cigarettes.  She's drinking.  We're not thinking anything, okay?  We go back to her apartment  because she says there's some kind of party going on.  We go into her apartment,  and a bunch of her roommates and their friends  were listening to Pink Floyd, was it?  Dark Side of the Moon.  Dark Side of the Moon,  and they were just completely hammered.  The lights off and just like, yeah.  Lights off and stuff.  Why does this story sound familiar?  I've told you.  I don't think I've ever told it on the air, though.  Really?  No, never been. 
[01:12:00]  This has never been told on the air.  I don't think so.  Not the whole story.  No?  No.  All right, because I'm kind of thinking  I remember hearing this recently,  and I thought it was on the air.  Off the air, we talked about it.  Yeah, off the air.  Yeah, there's a couple other parts of the story.  So we weren't really feeling it,  because these people were really just shit-faced  and just laying around with black lights on  and lava lamps and dark side of the moon playing.  And Stephanie goes,  hey, guys, you want to come up to the roof?  I got a really, really cool view.  So we go up there with some beers or something, Ben, right? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, something.  Which, yeah, she just proceeded to ply Opie.  Yeah, she was trying to...  This is one of the stories that we couldn't tell  for years and years.  Yeah, because it was weird.  So we're on the roof,  and she's showing us the view,  and we're drinking and stuff.  And I'm getting kind of uncomfortable,  because now she's hitting on me,  and I'm thinking, well,  we're trying to do something with Fox and Bill O'Reilly.  This is not a good scene, you know?  And then Ben, like,  you had enough of that point, right? 
[01:13:00]  I left.  Yeah, I left you there.  Ben leaves.  I'm still on the roof with this girl.  She goes, I'll be right back.  She comes back upstairs with a blanket.  She wants action,  and she's got...  Well, that pretty much says it all right there.  She's got more, you know,  beers happening and stuff.  And I had some guilt there,  because, you know,  I was going out with someone,  and I'm like, I can't.  I did it.  No, I can't.  Yeah, I'm trying to get out of this situation now, right?  So I go back downstairs,  and I'm trying to remember  how this next part happened, 
[01:13:30]  but I guess I was in the...  I'm trying to remember.  There was some reason I didn't leave right away.  I was hanging out in the living room  with all the stoners and stuff, right?  Yeah.  And these guys were basically passing out  all over the room.  And all of a sudden,  I hear this voice going,  Opie!  And I'm like, yeah, what?  And she goes, come here.  And the bathroom door is, like,  slightly askew.  I go in there.  She's completely naked in a bathtub  with candles all around,  scrubbing her bush.  Really?  I swear to God.  I'm like, what? 
[01:14:00]  I want to show you it's clean.  So she's taking a bath,  and I'm like, wow.  So I check it out for a few minutes.  Like, that's really cool.  Then I start laughing like an idiot  because I'm like,  I just can't do this, you know?  I swear to you, I can't do this.  And I run out of the place.  Where was Fred?  I know, right?  Was Fred in the tub behind her?  So I...  Did you leave your underpants,  your wet underpants in the car?  So...  You're ripping me off, Rob.  I invented chicks naked in the bathtub.  Yeah, this story sounds familiar. 
[01:14:30]  So I just start just giggling like an idiot,  and I run out.  I run out on her.  I'm like, no, this can't happen, you know?  So I'm running down the stairs of her apartment.  She gets to the top of the stairs.  She's hammered in a bathrobe,  wide open, yelling and screaming at me  because I won't have sex with her.  Wow.  And I ran out of there laughing.  I called Ben immediately, like,  dude, you're not going to believe this fucking story.  So I tell him, right?  So then, yeah, we had...  And then two days later,  we did the Hooters signing.  All right, yeah,  this is where it gets really good.  So, you know, 
[01:15:00]  it was supposed to be a professional relationship  because she wanted us on O'Reilly  and vice versa.  Right.  It's, like, not a good thing  if you're, you know,  banging the producer of O'Reilly's show  while they're trying to get you on there.  So remember the magazine signing  we did at Hooters?  Of course.  We were in a lot of magazines  because we just got syndicated  and a bunch of magazines  did stories on us all at the same time.  So we came up with this idea  to get our listeners together  and we'll sign some magazines  and have a good time at Hooters,  drink some beers and stuff.  Remember the beer fight 
[01:15:30]  and all that that happened?  So anyway...  Wasn't Erin there earlier that night  making out?  Who?  Erin, who I eventually went up dating,  was there earlier.  I didn't meet her that night,  but she was making out  with another chick  at that Hooters signing  earlier that night.  Yes, that is, you're right.  The one that became  your girlfriend for a while.  Yeah, I didn't meet her that day though,  but she was making out  with a chick.  She had some photos of her.  It was just one of our  just wild get-togethers.  You know, it was a wild party.  It turned out to be  a huge beer fight later on.  But anyway, finally,  what I'm about to say  that ties into what Anthony was saying,  we're at the front table 
[01:16:00]  signing, you know,  the Penthouse interview  and whatever other magazines we're in  and I'm sitting next to Anthony  and everything's good,  a long line,  we have beers and everything.  All of a sudden,  I turned to Ben.  Ben has this look on his face.  I'm like, what, Ben?  And all of a sudden,  he's freaking out.  I go, what?  All of a sudden,  he points to his left arm like this,  starts tapping it,  and points to Stephanie.  Yeah.  I turn,  and for the first time,  notice that she has a fake arm.  Yeah, a fake arm. 
[01:16:30]  She had, like,  completely fake mannequin arm  with a little bracelet on it.  It's plastic.  It's like one of those,  when you lose your arm,  they don't give you a hook anymore,  you know,  for the most part.  You get these plastic arms  that actually,  some of them can move,  get a little movement.  Right.  But hers,  I don't think moved.  No, no,  it just was a mannequin hand.  It didn't move at all.  Hold on,  we've got to get Corey from Yonkers  on the phone.  Corey.  Hey, guys,  how are you?  What's up?  Is this the same chick  you guys were partying with 
[01:17:00]  at the back of the studio,  and you took a picture  of her skirt,  and her tampon string  was hanging out?  No, what happened was...  But yes,  that is the same girl.  Is that the same day, though?  Yes.  Same day.  It was right after the party.  We all went home,  but she went back to the office  with Stinky, I think.  She went back to the office.  Smoked pot with Stinky.  And smoked pot,  and I think they even  had a little thing.  And Rick drew an arrow  on her,  Rick drew stuff  on her legs with Sharpies.  There was an arrow  pointing to her snatch.  Yeah.  And she still was,  you know,  working me,  trying to get me,  and I used to have  this disposable camera 
[01:17:30]  on my desk  for when, you know,  Slurpees came by.  Oh, you know,  let's get a photo  type of thing.  And she proceeded  to take pictures  of herself,  her snatch.  You know,  because she had a skirt on,  so she, you know,  threw the camera down there  and was just snapping away.  String coming down.  And she forgot  that she was having her time,  so all these pictures  had a string.  Didn't it strike you as odd  when she was holding  all of her beers  with one hand?  Like, you know,  just drinking  and then picking it up  and then kind of  just draping the towel  with that awful left arm?  There was nothing else  going on.  But this is the point  I want to make  about being an awful witness. 
[01:18:00]  Here's a girl  that spent a lot of time  with us, you know,  leading up to the interview  with Bill O'Reilly.  We had, like I said,  face-to-face.  She was writing  on a notepad.  She was in studio.  None of that really matters,  does it?  Huh?  None of that,  as far as being a bad witness,  really matters  because I didn't notice.  But the clincher, Opie,  of you being  a horrible witness  is the fact that  you were looking at her  naked in a bathtub  and did not notice.  And didn't notice  she had a fake arm.  That's why Ben and I  were like,  what?  Because she's naked 
[01:18:30]  in this bathtub,  she's on the roof,  she's partying with us,  she was in the bar  smoking and drinking,  and not,  this is the point  I want to make,  not one of us,  not one of the crew  noticed that this girl  had a fake arm  until we were at Hooters.  What Jimmy did?  Jim did.  When did you notice?  It was the first time  I met her.  Really?  Jim was the first one  to point it out,  and I think Voss was there.  Why didn't you tell  I was at Hooters?  No, it was at Hooters.  I remember Jim,  I think we're sitting  with Voss,  and they were laughing  hysterically,  and they're the ones  who pointed it out.  Jim's the one  who came over  and told me. 
[01:19:00]  It was the creepiest  feeling when finally  Ben got my attention  and said,  oh my God,  freaking out,  and I turned,  and when I saw  that plastic arm,  I'm like,  I got this weird feeling,  and like,  did she just lose  that arm last week?  How did we not notice?  It all adds up,  like, ah,  we're in Macy's,  and you thought  you started talking  to the mannequins,  now I understand.  But just going back  to this,  being a horrendous witness,  you know?  Yeah,  that seems to be  something you would have  caught in the bathtub. 
[01:19:30]  I just started laughing.  I'm like,  there's no way  I'm doing this.  Sorry.  No.  Call me whatever you have to,  but I have to go home.  I have to go home.  I got Allison at home.  I have to go immediately.  And then,  because she's all drunk  and stuff,  just screaming at me  from the top of the stairs.  Why don't you fuck me?  Why are you rejecting me?  The bathrobe.  Is she dripping still?  It was just the whole thing  that was going on. 
[01:20:00]  Hey, what's up?  This is Bill Burrow,  the red-headed white boy  from Chappelle's show.  That's all right.  I don't know who you are either.  You're listening to  Opie and Anthony.  We don't need money.  Don't take fame.  Don't need no credit card  to write in this train.  We're standing in certain  and it's been some kind of thing.  But if I don't see your life,  that's the power of love.  Ah, the power of love,  of course.  There he is.  Huey Lewis in studio. 
[01:20:30]  We finally got a real celebrity in here.  That is Huey Lewis.  I'm not even kidding you,  as opposed to a fake celebrity.  Wow.  Yeah, we've had plenty of fake celebrities.  We get a lot of fake celebrities,  you know.  People that think they're celebrities,  things like that.  But you are indeed a celebrity.  I appreciate that.  And we apologize  for making you wait out there  with Stalker Patty.  I had fun talking to Patty.  Did you really?  No, you didn't.  No, I honestly did.  Of course, I did all the talking.  Yeah, she was probably  just like gushing over you.  Hi, Huey.  It's a pleasure to meet you. 
[01:21:00]  You know Patty.  I can tell.  Oh, we know her.  Well, yeah.  She's not called Stalker Patty  for nothing.  She's a big fan.  That's the power of love.  It's always singing along  with your songs and everything.  That's good.  Huey Lewis, man.  Talk about an icon in music.  You were there,  geez, beginning at MTV.  How many music videos  you remember watching  with Huey Lewis in the news?  Too many to count, Anthony.  The hit songs,  one after another.  It was like you were  glomming the hits. 
[01:21:30]  And the guy doesn't age.  You look exactly the same.  I do.  I really look good.  Your viewers don't have to.  No.  We'll get some pictures, though.  That's my thing.  Looking good.  Looking good.  Very important thing.  And a big fan of XM, right?  Big fan of XM.  You got XM Satellite Radio?  I got XM Satellite Radio.  What's the channels you listen to?  I go to that 80s channel a little bit.  What, Fred?  I bounce around.  The Fred channel?  No, the 80s.  Oh, just the 80s?  You don't like the decades channels, do you? 
[01:22:00]  I hate the decades channels.  I am on those all the time.  I'm a niche guy.  I got a whole, like, preset that is just, what do I, I go 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and I'll just  pop through them all.  It's nostalgic.  At one point, you hit 60s, and I'm a little kid listening to Monday, Monday, la, la, la.  And then, boom, I'm in the 80s.  It's the power of love.  Da, da, da, da.  Back to the future.  And then, boom, I'm in the 70s.  I love, it's a time machine on four wheels. 
[01:22:30]  No 40s channel?  Huh?  I figured you'd be into that 40s channel.  No, I'm not quite.  I'm not quite going back to the 40s.  How far back do you go in the decades?  Do you go to the 40s?  I love the 40s.  That was the great audio age, pre-television.  That's when radio really mattered, you know?  Yeah, that's what they tell me.  True.  I don't know.  I mean, people learned how to dress and how to be that way. 
[01:23:00]  I mean, we were just talking about that outside.  With Patty?  She remembers.  I mean, you know, and you think about the best minds of the black generation, for example,  were musicians.  Couldn't be doctors and lawyers.  Most of them were from the South.  Yeah.  They're from Kansas City or St. Louis and those jazz bands, and they're dying to get to New  York, to get out of the South.  Yeah.  And that's what the music told us, and that was the cutting edge.  You know, it wasn't any TV.  People listened to radio to find out what was hip.  I like New York in June.  How about you?  That kind of stuff.  Yeah.  That was when radio really mattered. 
[01:23:30]  And radio stinks now.  Commercial radio stinks.  Yeah, commercial radio's rough.  I mean, all the commercials.  I've been doing the commercial radio since I was 18, and now the satellite, it's a whole  new world.  I don't think there's, you know, San Francisco, we were talking about that.  San Francisco, which, you know, pioneered FM radio with Big Daddy Tom Donahue and KSAN and  KMPX and all this, when it was really happening.  We were glued to that channel.  And now, I don't know that there's a radio station in San Francisco that's programmed 
[01:24:00]  by somebody who lives in San Francisco.  Yeah.  So, all the corporations have taken over.  I think they're in Phoenix or Fresno or San Antonio or somewhere like that.  Yeah.  And it's almost impossible for a new artist to get on or, you know.  Well, audio isn't enough anymore.  No.  The other thing that's interesting is music used to be the domain of blind artists because  they could play so good and blah, blah, blah.  But nowadays, we're going to have another Stevie Wonder?  I don't know.  How'd they make the video? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, right.  It's a problem.  Yeah.  That and you got to have something on there for your computer.  You got to have something on the disc that you can pop in and be interactive with it.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  What are you working on?  Well, I'm doing a Broadway show at the moment in Chicago, right?  Yeah, Chicago, the musical, which has really been fun.  Wow.  And it was a big challenge for me and I finally kind of got it together and it's really fun.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's the hardest part?  Got to be memorizing things, right?  Let's see. 
[01:25:00]  What is the hardest part?  The hardest part is doing it all at once.  You know, you have to sing and dance and remember all your lines and act.  And then you have to be an ensemble player.  So, you know, in my gig, which I wrote myself, I can do whatever I want to do.  If I want to go over there, I go over there.  If I want to hit a different note, I hit a different note.  Here, I have to, you know, it's very disciplined.  Yeah.  Take direction.  Yeah.  Wow, man.  That's got to...  Did you ever think you'd do Broadway?  Never.  Yeah, right?  Never, never.  And I didn't think I would this time either. 
[01:25:30]  It's daunting.  You know, the talent to humility ratio is huge on Broadway, which is refreshing coming from  rock and roll, frankly.  And, you know...  Those Broadway audiences are fickle.  Oh, they're the worst.  I went and saw The Odd Couple recently.  Yeah.  With Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane.  And it was great.  I loved it.  But, man, you get these Broadway...  That's all these people do, is go to Broadway, you know?  I don't know.  And they are so fickle, man.  Yeah, I know.  They're tough.  They're really a tough audience. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Critics.  Well, I was going to decline politely, but as it happens, my son goes to NYU, and I was  visiting him anyway.  So I said, well, let me see the show.  And they gave me two tickets, and we went, and I was knocked out by the show.  The music is fantastic.  You got to hear it more than once, but it's phenomenal.  But does your son want Daddy around all the time, though?  Exactly.  Because I bet you're now living in New York, right?  Living in New York.  Calling him up a little too much.  Trying not to smother him, right?  That's right.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right. 
[01:26:30]  Fortunately, I have a show every night.  And he's got a cool father, you know?  Huey Lewis.  But I'm sure it doesn't matter if you've got a celebrity father.  It's still the same shit, man.  It is.  It is.  Dad, leave me alone, man.  I'm trying to get late here, will ya?  You got it.  You got it.  How does the Broadway, the traditional Broadway, I guess, actors and singers, how do they react to  you coming in?  You know, do they look at it like, hey, hot shot rock guy coming in, or are you warmly  accepted?  Isn't that wild?  I mean, wouldn't you think there'd be a little bit of resentment somehow? 
[01:27:00]  But there isn't.  As far as, either that or they're very good at faking it.  Hiding it, yeah.  But they're just wonderful.  And they root for ya.  And my understudy in the role is a guy who taught me the role, Bernard Dotson.  He's a member of the ensemble.  He's a fabulous Billy Flynn in his own right.  He doesn't feel...  I mean, he's just rooting for me.  Behind the scenes, he's calling up the guys from the news and going, I think Huey wants  to get the band back together again.  No, no.  Just get him out of here, please.  I can't tell you how wonderful the company has been and how great everybody is.  And I would think, you know, I would think if I was a gypsy and I'd been working on Broadway 
[01:27:30]  for 20 years, I'd feel a little resentment when some guy came in.  But I haven't felt a thing like that.  Hey, what happened to the news?  We're writing.  We're going back.  You are, you are.  But what are those guys doing while you're doing this?  They're writing.  Do they do other...  Playing other gigs, yeah.  Oh, they do other band projects and stuff?  Well, yeah, working on their...  Everybody's got home studios and...  You've still been touring, though, as a band this whole time?  Yeah.  We never quit.  We've got someone on the line that says they see Huey every year in Atlantic City. 
[01:28:00]  See?  Yeah, Atlantic City's huge.  Well, we...  Yeah.  A lot of...  Yeah.  No, you know something?  It's a gig.  When I drive there, when I drive there, you see billboards of people you never would have  thought would have played Atlantic City.  Same thing.  And I think Vegas kind of turned that around, because Vegas used to be where it was kind  of cheesy if you ended up in Vegas.  Not anymore.  Now, though, there are big-name rock acts playing Vegas and Atlantic City.  And the same thing's true with, you know, if you were a TV actor, you didn't do film.  Yeah.  That's all blown out of the water now, too. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, commercials are another thing.  It's all screen time.  People really don't care about it.  It's not selling out if your song ends up in a commercial anymore.  I tell you, the amazing thing about Atlantic City is that, you know, we...  The amount of money they pay you, Huey, come on.  The gigs are sold out, and you can't get a hotel room.  Yeah.  And it's, you know, Atlantic City, it's not Hawaii.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You do a little of that gambling?  Eh, very little.  I like to play craps, but usually when I'm working in the hotel, you don't want to get  bothered if you go down, so I don't want to gamble usually. 
[01:29:00]  You don't like getting bothered anymore?  Eh.  Yeah, you must.  I don't mind it.  Let's face it.  When did it get old?  It's so recognizable.  Anybody who does what I do has got to like the attention a little bit, or he wouldn't have  done it in the first place.  But when did it get old for you, when they start bothering your family?  Well, you know, there's a part of the time...  Or when you're trying to take a leak, and some guy's trying to shake your hand.  That's not good.  That's not good.  There had to be a moment where you're like, wow, man, this is kind of a drag.  Well, like I said, anybody who does what I do has got to like the attention they would  have done it to begin with, so there's a period of time when you actually enjoy it. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, of course.  There's another period of time when you tolerate it, and hopefully there's a much smaller period  of time when it drives you up the wall.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's a great way to look at it.  And everybody's got a horror story on some celebrity.  And I tell you, the worst stories are the first class flight attendants, because, this  is my theory now, this is a personal theory, if you're in an airport, you're kind of like  fair game.  Yeah.  And so you're signing autographs and being nice and blah, blah, blah, blah, and you can't  wait to get on the airplane.  So they stop, finally they board the airplane, you get in your first class, you sit down in  your seat, and the flight attendant goes, oh my gosh, can I have your autograph? 
[01:30:00]  And you're stuck with them.  I saw Bob Saget was sitting in front of me when we were flying back from L.A. last time,  and-  He flipped out.  He, one of the flight attendants would not leave him alone.  Right.  Just kept coming up and talking to him and asking him things, and then going, all right, I'll  leave you alone, I'm sorry.  And then two seconds later, would come back again.  Yeah.  And, you know, where's Bob Saget going?  Unless he's got a parachute, he's there for the duration.  That's it.  And just being, you'd think they would tell these people, leave him alone. 
[01:30:30]  But that's where you get your best horror stories, are from limousine drivers and first  class flight attendants.  You got to do the spinal tap thing with the limo driver, right in the middle of talking,  you just bring the divider up.  Yeah.  Fucking limeys.  What's wild-  I love that scene.  What's wild about the limousine drivers is you assume that they're entirely discreet,  because you get in the back of a limousine, and the guy's up there, and he's got a uniform  on, and he says nothing, and you talk about whatever you want to talk about.  But all you need to know is get in a limousine and sometimes say, hey, who have you had in 
[01:31:00]  here lately?  And they'll just go everything.  What they've done, what they've talked about.  That's it.  Yeah, bastards.  Well, we got a lot of people that want to say hi to Huey.  Huey Lewis.  Andrew in New York, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I wanted to ask Huey how he felt about the use of his music in American Psycho.  Yeah, man.  I'm fine with that.  Yeah, that movie's fantastic.  I enjoyed it.  That was such a great scene.  Yeah, I enjoyed that.  The guy, you know, I'd read the book.  Which is a lot darker than the movie, believe it or not. 
[01:31:30]  But there was, we had a bit, there was kind of a slightly ugly story about the whole thing.  What happened was they asked us to use the song in the film.  I hadn't seen the film.  I knew the book.  I said, sure.  They had William Defoe.  It was clearly a serious movie.  We said, sure.  And on the eve of the release of the movie, they sprung this soundtrack CD on us that they're going to release.  Well, the soundtrack CD had our tune and a bunch of source music. 
[01:32:00]  It wasn't a great CD.  And I thought, eh, you know, I didn't even, I was on the road.  My manager said, should we, you know, we never signed up for the CD and we don't want our fans to buy it for the one song.  No, thank you.  We don't want to be on the CD.  Well, they were miffed by that.  So they issued a press release on the eve of the thing that I had pulled my track from the CD because I hated the movie that it was so violent and blah, blah, blah.  And that's why that grounds will start.  I hadn't even seen the movie, so I think it's fine.  Enjoyed it. 
[01:32:30]  Do you like Huey Lewis in the news?  Love that scene.  Let's go to John in Texas.  John.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, John.  Look, I was going to ask, Mr. Ruth, I'm kind of an 80s kid.  I'm a semi-fan.  And what I really wanted to know is you were not an unknown when you did the Back to the Future movies.  And how did that propel your further rise to fame with those set of movies?  Well, you know, an actual fact, you know, they asked us, do we want to write a song?  Steven Spielberg, Bob Zemeckis, and Bob Gale, who produced, directed, and wrote the film, asked to have a meeting. 
[01:33:00]  We had a meeting down there at Amblin.  And they said, we've written this movie and this character, Marty McFly's favorite band would be Huey Lewis in the news.  How would you like to write a song for the film?  And I said, we don't know how to write for film, but I'll send you the next thing we write.  Don't know how to write for film.  Which was...  A couple of hit songs?  Sure.  Well, we just wrote Power of Love and sent it to him, which I actually didn't think was going to work because there was no love interest.  But they used it and boom.  And the song was released, and it was a number one record before the movie was released. 
[01:33:30]  So Zemeckis, to this day, I saw him at the 25-year DVD thing.  They had three-pack, whatever.  And he said...  I bought it.  I know.  He said that was a big key to the marketing of the film was that the song was a smash before the movie came out.  So it didn't really...  The way that the movies didn't do anything for me, really.  It was great that the song was a big hit, and it was probably a bigger hit because of the movie.  So there.  Sorry.  You're just too darn loud. 
[01:34:00]  Exactly.  It's a big line.  Do you help Ray Parker Jr.?  I love it.  I can't talk about that, I'm afraid.  Not at all.  No, that was a whole lot.  One of those can't talk about shit.  That was one of those ugly things.  A deal was done and shut up.  Wow.  Does he call you?  No Christmas card?  How big was Huey Lewis in the news?  At your biggest point, comparable to the Stones, I don't know. 
[01:34:30]  Were you as big as the biggest rock groups out there that people still talk about or something?  At your highest, were you as big as U2 or something?  Sports and four.  Yeah, I have no idea.  Huge.  Like, you couldn't even imagine.  I'm trying to equate it to a hip-hop artist, something you'd understand.  I can't even.  Big, legit.  Just big like that.  Massive.  Really?  I mean, I know.  Like, LL in the day.  But I know Huey Lewis in the news.  I want a new, I know that shit.  I'm just saying, I want how big, because I'm so stupid, I thought maybe the motherfuckers 
[01:35:00]  that went, take on me.  Uh-huh.  They ought to be.  I don't fucking know.  Are you out of your mind?  I had one hit.  That was a big one for me, take on me.  Huey looked like he wanted to knock the motherfuckers.  I'm just saying, I don't know how big it was.  He was LL.  We were as big as Pee-wee Herman.  When he was as big as...  At his peak.  At his peak.  We're doing great with Huey.  I love Patrice.  You mentioned Ray Parker and A-ha.  His question to the musicians.  He wants to knock your teeth out.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just asking, what the fuck do you want from me? 
[01:35:30]  Jesus Christ.  A-ha had one hit, although they were huge in Europe.  Who was?  A-ha.  I mean, I'm not comparing this guy.  I know he's a rocker, but I'm just saying in terms of big-ness.  He was huge.  What is bigness?  What is bigness?  What?  Record sales?  Lots of number ones, right?  Booty.  A few number ones.  Few.  Many millions sold.  Yeah, I guess.  They made us rip up the tape at church camp.  I'll tell you that.  Yeah, what happened there?  Yeah, Leslo got in trouble because he was listening to you, Huey.  There's an interesting new artist called Paul Thorne, who's a real good songwriter and a buddy of ours, who opens for us. 
[01:36:00]  And he was raised in Tupelo, Mississippi, and his father was a Baptist preacher, and he wasn't allowed.  And the first record he got was Picture This.  It was one of our records.  And it's true.  I didn't think it was quite such devilish music.  Well, they made us rip up him and Duran Duran.  Duran Duran.  Wait, what happened, Leslo?  That's the slippery slope to hell.  You go to these church camps. 
[01:36:30]  They're like a week long.  You know, you're a young kid.  You have chapel every night, and they just rail on and on about, you know, current music and how it's the path to the devil and all this.  And then they maybe see you listening to your Walkman.  What are you listening to?  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  Seriously, I probably shouldn't say this, but it's okay.  And I like the music a lot.  But the message for rappers about get rich or die trying, that's a hell of a message, isn't it, to give the kids?  Get rich or die trying?  I mean, I don't get that. 
[01:37:00]  Frankly, in my day, at least, it was a little more, you know, creative than that, I think.  And that's the one thing I worry about.  Well, it's from where you are.  Very materialistic.  Very materialistic.  And they buy into that whole American thing that's, that's, that's, there we go.  Very materialistic, your people.  Patrice has woken up.  Don't you think?  I mean, deal with it.  No, I mean, I'm saying it's just where you're from.  It's like fucking.  How come white people have such great music?  Why the fuck?  That's the question. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, no, I want a new drug.  I mean, give me a fucking break.  I loved I want a new drug.  Fucking, I want a new drug.  It was a metaphor.  It was a metaphor.  Exactly.  Why the fuck can't 50 have a metaphor?  Get rich or die trying.  What's the metaphor?  Maybe that means have a heart attack because you're working so fucking hard.  No, it's not.  It does not.  He doesn't say get rich or kill a motherfucker in a, in a bank robbery because he's, it's  a metaphor.  I don't know why.  What is that a metaphor for?  The same metaphor that I want a new drug, the connotation that you can make, I want, 
[01:38:00]  I'm not, I'm just saying it's the same thing as get rich or die trying.  How come it can't be I'm going to work hard until I die?  Well, it's actually completely opposite.  Right.  Exactly.  I want a new drug is about, I want a new drug that makes me feel like it when I'm with  you, which is love, blah, blah, blah.  I mean, it ain't the biggest message in the world, but.  Huey, all I hear is drug use.  That's what I hear, right?  The rest is fucking Spanish to me.  All right.  It's just cocaine to me. 
[01:38:30]  You're right.  You're right.  Well, we got Mark the Trucker on the line.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Pretty good.  Morning.  Huey, I wanted to ask you, did you ever find that new drug?  Still looking, man.  Still looking.  I love your band, man.  I listen to you all the time, though.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Very cool.  Dave in California.  Dave.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Pretty good.  We're having a good time.  Hey, Huey.  I met you years ago over at the AT&T Pro.  How's the golf game going?  Non-existent. 
[01:39:00]  It's 22 degrees in New York City, man.  He lives in New York now, so.  You got to get back to California?  There goes the handicap, right?  Yeah, there goes the handicap.  We got the best courses.  You know it.  Punching out, guys.  Actually, I'll tell you, Long Island's got some awesome golf courses.  You go all the way out east there?  I haven't been out there.  Black course.  They're all up there.  There are a lot of them out there.  Make sure you play Bethpage Black.  That's the one where you tee off first hole and lose your ball.  Yeah, it's just never fun.  It's over 200 yards before you even hit the fairway. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  On some of these holes.  Yeah.  Before you even hit the fairway.  Do you find it harder to write now than it was back in the 80s, maybe?  I mean, do you run out of ideas or things to write?  Yeah, I mean, that's very valid.  I don't know why that is.  But part of it's when you've written a bunch of songs,  and now you go to start writing something,  it's kind of like something you already did.  You can't have rock and roll in there.  We have a song called Hard to Rock and Roll.  Well, there's your rock and roll in the title song.  Yeah, you don't want to.  You can't have the kidney of rock and roll. 
[01:40:00]  You know what I mean?  I mean, you're done with that.  So there is stuff where places you can't go  because you already did that in a way.  And is there also just getting a little older?  I think so.  Your mindset changes?  I think so.  Some of the subject matter?  You know, Dylan dealt with that in the 60 Minutes thing,  which was very interesting, and they asked him.  You just don't know where those songs come from, to be honest.  You have to be open to that, and the muse comes or she doesn't.  And it is tougher to write when you get older, I think.  But I also think that 12 things, like a CD now is 12 tunes or something, 
[01:40:30]  I think that's just too many.  Yeah.  And why is it that recorded music all has to be the exact same size  and the exact same price?  In other words, why are all 12 songs for, no matter if it's Miles Davis or 50 Cent,  why has it all got to be the same?  Why, look, paintings are different sizes and different prices.  Books are different sizes and different prices.  Even wine, for Christ's sake, is different prices.  What about limited vintage aimed to a boutique-y market? 
[01:41:00]  And then Joni Mitchell might make another record,  and Randy Newman might make another record.  But we're losing our great artists because everything's the same price.  It's sold like a commodity, and record labels, therefore,  if they want to maximize their profits, they've got to sell more CDs,  so they aim for the kids.  It sounds to me like you want to write three songs and get $20 an album for it.  Now you're talking.  That's kind of what I'm getting here.  That's what the record companies are upset about with iTunes. 
[01:41:30]  Everything should not be 99 cents.  They're saying some songs are worth 20 cents.  Other songs are worth $2.50.  Well, you know, the bottom line is it ought to be treated as an art form.  American popular music is arguably America's greatest contribution to the world and culture.  Forty years ago, America grew things, built things.  I put polio vaccine.  Yeah, we invented the Internet.  I think I might put that over.  I'd say polio vaccine, music.  I wasn't polio vaccine started in France, I think. 
[01:42:00]  Damn it.  With Pasteur, really.  Louis Pasteur.  I don't know.  But whatever.  American popular.  But when you go around the world today, you hear America's music everywhere.  Yeah.  I mean, in Africa, in Europe, and Asia, and so on.  And we, our business, that is, treats it like gasoline or rice, like a commodity.  I also always wanted to know, especially with somebody that's had the success that you've had  and the amount of hit songs, when you play out, when you write a new album, let's say, 
[01:42:30]  and you put out new music, and you perform it live, you know what the majority, let's say,  pretty much 99% of the audience is there.  They want to see the stuff that you've done already, your hits.  Is that frustrating as an artist?  That's a great question.  It's a very good question.  I'll tell you why.  I went and saw The Stones over the summer.  And it was like, the new stuff is definitely really good, but it's like, why are you wasting  20 minutes on the new stuff?  I want to hear, you know, Sympathy or what have you. 
[01:43:00]  Exactly, exactly.  And that's understandable.  People want to hear your songbook.  And as long as you don't work too much, it's real fun to play your songbook.  I mean, you love those songs anyway, as long as you don't have to play them 200 nights  a year.  So that's why you tour, and you take big breaks between tours.  We work 85 shows a year, which is fine.  It's like falling in love all over again.  But then again, you do need new things.  Why?  Because as a storyteller, you need a new story every once in a while.  And so all you need are one or two things for yourself, and that's generally what happens. 
[01:43:30]  They make a new record, The Stones.  They come out, they play two songs from it, and then all of a sudden...  Do you ever glance over at one of the guys in the band during Power of Love or something  and just go, you believe we're still playing this song?  Well, you know, when you get to that point, it's time to take a little bit of a holiday.  Yeah.  I mean, when you see a band up there and they do 36 minutes and the singer comes out after 15  and they're miserable, it's because it's their sixth night in a row.  Right.  I mean, if you don't work too much, it's like falling in love all over again.  Take two weeks off, it's a ball.  It's the creative curse, because we do a very creative radio show, and there are times I 
[01:44:00]  look at Anthony like, can you believe we're telling this fucking story again?  But we have to.  And I'm not even kidding you.  And some of the...  All right.  Who's going to put the weird little different twist on it this time?  And some of the old listeners will call us out like, dude, you've told that story  10 times, but we know the audience is building and building, and we have to go down  some of these roads so they get to know us.  It's not a crow, it's an owl.  Yeah.  So how do some groups...  I'm sorry, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  No, it's okay.  How do some groups get out...  Like, I'm just...  I keep saying U2, because it's the only thing I can think of in terms...  But it seems like people are accepting to U2, who's been around for years and years, they're 
[01:44:30]  accepting that they're going to play new music, and they're not going to play whatever their  hit was.  They're one of the few, man.  But how do you get that thing where we want to hear the new shit, too?  Like, Vertigo is just as big.  It's very hard.  It's very hard to go through a couple of decades and be relevant and update yourself  where you're just as popular as you were, and it's because of your new music and your  old catalog.  I don't know how it's done.  I don't know what the formula is there for it.  No, I think that's a good point, and they've done a very good job. 
[01:45:00]  They take huge breaks between records and really work on their new records, number one.  And number two, they are subject to some of those same things.  People go see U2, they want to hear the old things, too.  I mean, they really do.  That's true, yeah.  They're the same.  And they're, you know...  Did you used to write on the road?  Yeah.  All right, because we have interviewed so many bands, and when they go and tour, they stop  the creative process.  I don't get that.  Yeah.  I would think if I was a lead singer and I was writing the songs for the band, that  I would just... would be writing all the time. 
[01:45:30]  Well...  It seems like then the tour ends, it's like, all right, now it's time to write the new  album.  Yeah, yeah.  And I never understood that when bands would come in here and tell us that.  Well, because when you're doing a show, if you're putting a show together, then your  daytime's worried about re-remaking, re-working the show.  I think there's downtime on the bus or the hotel room where all of a sudden you got a little  thought.  It almost seems like they don't even use that part of their brain until the tour's over.  And we wrote a lot of our good stuff on the road in the early days.  And again, don't write so much on the road anymore, so maybe that's a problem. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, writing is a chore.  It's tough.  And Joni Mitchell said, what's interesting is that now, you know, my stuff is our pop  songs.  And I don't mean that demeaningly.  I mean, I like that.  You know, rock and roll can be about anything.  Yeah.  As long as when the guy says, I'm going to Kansas City, they got some crazy little women  there and I'm going to get me one.  We believe he's going to Kansas City.  He knows about the crazy little women and he wants to get him one.  And it's rock and roll, you know.  So it can be about anything.  It doesn't need to be about things. 
[01:46:30]  But you're informed by your audience to a certain extent.  In the old days, you write with the radio.  You know there are people out there.  Want a New Drug is a pop song sent to a generation that relates to that.  Well, how do you do that when now you know you're not going to get played on the radio?  Right.  Period.  I mean, Joni Mitchell made this same point.  So who are you writing for?  And suddenly, well, and where are you going to go?  You go to television.  Our crowd, if you're over 28 and white and not country, then you've got to go to TV. 
[01:47:00]  And where are you going?  You go to David Letterman.  And then you get tacked on at the end and he doesn't talk to you.  Right.  And blah, blah, blah.  It's just cheap to be a singer anymore.  You know?  Yeah.  And so it's tougher to write because you're informed by your audience.  There's no going to MTV anymore.  Radio has really abandoned a lot of good music.  I remember when Joni...  And video.  And MTV and all of that.  You guys were huge on MTV.  And it was a little odd because you, even then, you guys didn't really fit the bill of 
[01:47:30]  what was going on at the time.  You know?  I mean, you didn't have the look of the guys that were on there.  I remember, as a matter of fact, what was it?  One, Beavis and Butthead.  I believe it was like, this guy looks like a friend of my dad's.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  Hysterical.  Well, you know, we never were.  We formed right before music television in the late 70s.  Yeah.  So we never really set ourselves up to be trendy because it was no...  It was an audio deal.  It wasn't about a visual thing. 
[01:48:00]  It was an audio deal.  Now, had we started later, we probably would have adopted...  I mean, we would have done anything.  Believe me.  If nothing else, it's a compliment to your music because, you know...  The music did the talk as a visual.  And it served us well over the long haul because now our stuff that we wrote in our 20s is  actually more relevant.  We were anachronistic then.  You know, we were old-fashioned then.  Yeah.  And now it actually lives stuck with you doing off my baby if this is it.  These are more for sort of...  Were you one of the bands affected by Nirvana?  What do you mean affected by Nirvana? 
[01:48:30]  Well, I mean...  Oh, man.  I like Huey because he's a...  No, it's all right.  He's a mean motherfucker.  What do you mean affected by...  What do you mean, nigga?  Say it.  There were a lot of bands that went away because of Nirvana.  Like the hair bands and stuff.  What effect did that have on you guys?  I don't know.  We were...  Because you weren't really in the...  We were off the radio.  You really weren't in the hair band category that it really affected.  But it seemed like that just reinvented everything when they came around.  I don't know. 
[01:49:00]  I think the hair bands affected like that whole influx of poison and Motley Crue and  everything kind of got where MTV was like, this is all we're playing.  You turned on MTV, all you saw was a blonde lead singer with the hair down to his ass.  And the makeup.  And the makeup and stuff.  And that was...  Some guy welding and then a shot of some chicks.  A chick with a sword.  That would affect him, though.  I can imagine that would affect you.  And how about now the television became so much more important.  And a lot of our pop bands and hard rock bands seem to come from Sweden. 
[01:49:30]  What's up with that?  When did Scandinavia be a hotbed of American popular music?  They are the whitest people you can find.  They're the most attractive.  And they look good on television.  99 Luftballons.  I think she was German.  Whatever.  But, you know, just to finish the previous thought, you know, and Randy Newman said this,  who's one of my favorite artists, and, you know, he won an Oscar for the song he wrote 
[01:50:00]  for the Toy Story.  Is that right?  I think it was Toy Story.  Got a friend in me or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And he kind of poo-pooed it in an article that I read because his latest record, which  I still think is his latest record, it's called Bad Love.  If it's an album, and if you're a Randy Newman fan, I mean, it's a masterpiece record.  Yeah.  And sold nothing.  And never got a play, boom, boom, boom, nothing.  Yeah, where would it get played, you know?  Yeah, exactly.  That's the problem.  And it's an absolute masterpiece. 
[01:50:30]  It's funny.  It's poignant.  It's wonderful.  It's musically rich.  It's orchestrated wonderfully.  Well-produced.  Really great.  Probably his best work.  Wow.  And he got no attention.  Yeah.  That's a bitch.  Thanks.  And what about acting?  Go get him, Satellite Radio.  Any more movies?  Well, you know, I'm-  You got pretty good reviews for duets.  I saw that in a hotel one night, and you did a great job.  I am in show business.  I'll do anything for money or attention. 
[01:51:00]  Is that it?  All right.  It's Huey Lewis.  He's on Broadway doing the Chicago thing.  Anything else we're promoting today?  No.  You can promote.  I can promote?  Yeah.  You've got to have a CD or something out there.  I got a-  Our best work is a thing called Live at 25.  It's a DVD and a live CD, and it's out a year now, but it's sort of a snapshot of where  we are at the moment.  We've sort of reinvented ourselves over the last 10 years into this- We have a three-piece  horn section now.  We've sort of reversed into the playing music the way, you know, there was before all this 
[01:51:30]  stuff.  We've got five autographed copies of that we'll give away right now.  Nice.  Huey, thanks.  This was great.  Hey, thanks a lot.  Nice chat with you guys.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  Hi, everyone.  This is Huey Lewis, and no matter where I am in America, I tune my XM satellite radio to  Opie and Anthony.  Wee!  I just got wowed!  And some big old hooties on her.  It's the Opie and Anthony wow line.

Tell us where, tell us when, and tell us what those delicious boobies look like.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we just might use it on the air.  Ooh!

AOL.com has deemed these CEOs as chief everything officers. 
[01:54:00]  They're everyday women and men who have the extraordinary ability to balance home, career, and kids, yet still have time for themselves.  Sound like somebody you know?  AOL and Dove are searching for women and men who exemplify the qualities of the CEO.  A big kiss and hug and a heartfelt, I love you, mom or dad, are worth their weight in gold.  But wouldn't a little recognition and some tangible trophies from outside your family also be nice?  To enter someone in the contest or get essential tips on saving time or even carving out a little for yourself, visit AOL.com slash CEO. 
[01:54:30]  After all, we CEOs are an awfully busy bunch.  Sometimes we just need a little reminder to let us know you care.  Rewarding you into tomorrow, I'm Dave Graveline.  High Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or XM-CANADA at 877-438-9677.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:55:00]  The worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Awful.  Hey! Hey!  We're sitting down with the fire!  Ah, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, brother.  Spread the virus, people.  Spread the virus.  Tell people that we're doing this fine radio program for XM Satellite Radio.  What's wrong, Anthony?  Uh, Hump X from Rhode Island.  Ant, you're a fucking tool.  You call yourself a hardcore gamer and you're recommending Dell.  Dell, if you have to recommend off-the-shelf systems, at least go with Falcon NW or Alienware for fuck's sake.  Uh, dude, a lot of people don't have 13 Gs to spend on a computer, first of all. 
[01:56:00]  I could if I wanted to.  I go through computers a lot.  So, uh, I get Dell and they work fine for gaming.  What do you think?  I'm getting the off-the-shelf fucking $600 model of Dell?  I build it.  I put in huge, uh, great video cards, a shitload of RAM.  Don't worry about it.  My computer's fine.  I have a problem with Dell's customer service.  Not their computers.  At least not yet.  Who knows what the hell's going on over there now.  Maybe their computers blow ass, too.  Because their customer service stinks. 
[01:56:30]  They're doing what everybody is doing now.  Outsourcing.  This is a huge problem in, uh, this country.  Quickly, I was just gonna say, does anyone's customer service work?  Is it any...  No.  It's every customer service.  Customer service sucks now.  Uh, you, you, you, you end up on hold for hours on end when you try to make a phone call  to any of these people.  The menus take you on this, uh, if I could say wild goose chase.  It's like a wild goose chase.  And it used to be, but I guess they caught on to this. 
[01:57:00]  It used to be at any time during the menu, you could hit that zero and wait for the live  person and get a real human being on the phone and say, here's my problem, here's the help  I need.  Maybe, you know, your menu didn't give the option that I needed, but not anymore.  That's not even an option anymore.  If the mechanical person online can't help you, you are fucked.  And Dell is now the worst.  They sent, uh, all their customer service over to India, just like everyone else. 
[01:57:30]  Microsoft, a lot of the airlines, customer service is based over there.  Uh, a lot of tech stuff, all based over in India.  They train these people.  I saw a whole show on it, how they train these Indians to try to sound, uh, American.  They try to give them this generic American accent, uh, so, so as to fool the people that  are trying to call them.  They, I'm sorry.  They're not up on what's going on.  Maybe they're good at, uh, hiding their Indian accent, but, uh, they're not learning the product. 
[01:58:00]  These people have scripts they work from.  They have these, these things that if you have problem A, it's like a flow chart.  Uh, if you are confronted with a caller that has problem A, go C, B, or C.  If it's B, now C, D, E.  It just goes down the line.  The best is, uh, throwing, throwing them off their script.  Yeah.  Like I was on customer service for my, uh, my banking.  I'll get into my problem after yours because you started this.  But, uh, it starts with a guy, I finally got a guy after being stuck in the menu system 
[01:58:30]  for a long time.  And like you said, uh, so many people caught on that you could just push zero to get a  live voice that they basically have taken that option out of the game.  But eventually I did get a live voice.  I don't even know how I couldn't even tell you.  And the guy's like, hi, um, what is your social security number?  And I'm like, no, no, no, no.  I need to talk to, you know, hi, what is your, like, they didn't know what to do because  I didn't start with step one on their little script.  You went out of step.  And I'm like, no, I'm not giving your social security. 
[01:59:00]  But, but, but before, what is your social security?  They couldn't even improvise or anything.  No.  They didn't know what to do.  You're not getting a real person.  You're getting a computer because it's, it's some guy with a script that he can't deviate  from.  You're getting a, a meat machine.  Oh, who's calling?  I'll call.  Somebody calling?  Who would call Opie during the show?  Wouldn't they know you do a show?  Hello.  Hey. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, hi, Carmen.  How are you?  Oh, it's Carmen.  Are you calling me too early?  No, I'm usually up this early.  Who is that?  Citibank.  It's Citibank.  It's Citibank.  This is just what you were talking about.  At least you get a call back.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Account number what?  Okay.  How many millions?  What? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, well, just send my checks.  Ooh.  I need my, uh, make sure they send my checks.  You ordered checks?  Oh, I ordered checks two months ago.  What address are they going to?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh, first time.  What's your routing number?  A little Pan Am stickers on them?  Uh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:00:30]  Thank you.  Anything.  Just call her.  I'm sure she'd be easy to get in touch with, too.  Bye-bye.  After 50,000 menu prompts.  Did they just hear my address over the radio, too?  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  Jesus.  Was I'm...  That's exactly...  Yeah, I heard it.  That's exactly...  There's Pat Battle.  That's exactly what we were talking about.  That took three days to close, uh, an old account.  Three days.  It's finally done?  Ah, you'll see.  Supposedly.  Supposedly.  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry, Anthony.  So, uh, yeah, Dell, I used to just say it was the best thing ever, and customer service 
[02:01:00]  was great.  If I ever had a problem, I would call them, get a live person, and they would deal with  it immediately.  Now, uh, the beginning of June, um, one of the fans in my computer started making a noise.  I opened it up.  I was getting this fan warning thing, saying that there was a defective fan.  So, I opened it up, and, uh, one of the blades broke off of the fan.  So, I figure I'd get two new fans and replace both the fans that are in there. 
[02:01:30]  Call up Dell, uh, and threw, like, all kinds of prompts.  There's no way...  I...  There's no numbers on there.  I tried it through the website.  You cannot find this fan on their website, because, God forbid, they backlog any, uh,  equipment that you might need, like, three months ago.  So, it's all about their new computer, their new stuff, and anything old, go fuck yourself.  You're not getting a part for this thing.  So, I, I, I did get somebody live on the phone.  It was an Indian guy. 
[02:02:00]  Uh, and I don't even remember how I did it.  I've tried to do it again, to get a live person on the phone.  I can't do it.  So, I had this live guy on the phone, and I, I told him my model number of the computer  and everything, and ordered these fans.  He had such a problem understanding what I needed, and how to go about ordering it.  Uh, and I knew there was going to be a problem right then and there, because this had never  happened with Dell before.  So, I had to be satisfied, all right?  He took the order.  Also, they had my old Brooklyn address.  He goes, we're sending it to blah, blah, blah. 
[02:02:30]  I said, my old Brooklyn.  And I said, no, I have a new address.  Take this down.  And I said, please, I, I want an email confirmation of this entire transaction.  No problem, Mr. Kumia.  That will be sent out to you.  Everything will be fine.  I never got an email verification.  Uh, so I figured, what the hell?  I just waited, waited.  I, I finally check my order status.  You get your little order number, and you can check your order status.  I check it.  It says, orders canceled.  I go, what?  I didn't, what? 
[02:03:00]  So, now I try to get the live guy on the phone again.  You're playing with.  To no avail.  God, you're, go ahead, sorry.  To no avail.  Could not get the live person.  So, they have this feature called live chat.  We were able to chat with a customer service guy.  On a computer, right?  Yeah.  So, I get on there, and, and.  I bet you're using the C key a lot.  Oh, boy.  And the F key.  The M or F key.  The M, F key should be right next to each other.  Is it?  Oh.  I should have checked before I did my little check. 
[02:03:30]  Yes.  Okay, they're not next to each other.  Then you'll get, it is stupid.  Right.  Fuckers.  So, I'm chatting with this guy and saying, look, I never got the confirmation.  Now they're telling me the order's canceled.  And, of course, the first thing they do is apologize profusely for this problem that you're having.  And we will take care of it.  And he said, we have made a new order.  It should ship.  You should receive this on June 28th.  Like, okay.  I can take it.  Meanwhile, my computer sounds like a 767 warming up to take off because it's on one fan. 
[02:04:00]  And I'm playing pretty graphic intensive games.  So, the thing is really heating up.  I know I'm just going to blow the thing up.  So, I wait and wait.  I get no email confirmation again.  I go to check my order status.  It says, it says in the assembly phase of the whole thing.  Assembly phase.  When you order a computer, you go to Dell to check the status.  They have pre-order, order, assembly, inspection, boxing. 
[02:04:30]  Like, you could check the whole, every step of the way.  If you're ordering a part, there is no assembly part.  There is no assembly.  It's done.  Put the fucking fan in the box and send it to me.  Well, this went on and on and on and on.  Past June 28th.  So, then I try again to call.  No avail.  I get on the chat again.  And each time, you're starting brand new.  No one knows what the hell you're talking about.  There's no history there.  I try to convey to the guy what's been happening. 
[02:05:00]  Well, okay.  I'll check with shipping.  And I will email you.  I go, don't.  And now I'm cursing.  I'm like, don't bullshit me.  You guys are liars.  I go, I've been lied to by your customer service department.  I will email you when I speak to shipping.  Never got an email.  Again, nothing.  And this went on now yesterday.  I completely fed up.  Check the status again.  It's still in assembly.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  And this is, I've been on the chat and emails.  So, I took the original email I got and replied to that. 
[02:05:30]  I hit reply and just said, you guys, I am livid.  I cannot deal with it.  You're the worst customer service ever.  Please, I need these parts.  You think saying that you're livid is going to matter?  No, it doesn't do anything.  Okay, good.  So, I get the email last night.  It says, Mr. Kumia, we are very sorry that you have had a problem with this.  We will ship your camera as quickly as possible.  Yes, I just said camera. 
[02:06:00]  And now I'm reading this.  I start laughing my ass off.  I'm ordering a fucking ventilation fans.  Two fans.  A camera and some mysterious bracket item that they're sending me.  That they're going to give me free of charge, they said.  The bracket, not the camera.  And they said, here is where we're shipping it.  And what do you think the address was?  Brooklyn?  My old Brooklyn address.  You just want to throw the computer out the window. 
[02:06:30]  At this point, I'm scared to open up my own mail because the simplest tasks cause you the biggest headaches now.  This should be easy.  This is a part that obviously it's in their computers.  They know what the part is.  Send it out to me.  As soon as you see that there's a little problem, they give you a number to call.  You know you're in.  Screwed.  Hopefully just a day of hell.  But usually, no.  It's days or in Ant's case, over a month.  Over a month.  And now I just got this one. 
[02:07:00]  Here it is.  Mr. Cumia, thank you for contacting Dell Online Customer Care.  Oh.  And now the first thing is exactly what I've gotten.  I swear to you, this is probably my eighth email I've gotten from them that says,  I sincerely apologize for any miscommunication on our part and for the inconvenience this matter has caused.  I truly regret that we are not able to provide you with an experience that was completely satisfactory to you.  That's just garbage.  This is the, yeah, the standard pat friggin' bullshit response that they give you. 
[02:07:30]  Now, this is obviously somebody who isn't English or doesn't speak English.  They put down,  Please be advised that your order number for Dell Assembly Bracket is being delayed for a long time.  This order is delayed as our revenue department did not process it due to some technical reasons.  What?  What does that mean? 
[02:08:00]  So I have canceled this order.  They canceled it again.  Wait, this is just a brand new email right here?  Yeah, brand new right here.  Oh my God.  So we have canceled as our revenue department did not process it.  I have also placed a new order for Assembly Bracket, absolutely free of cost to you.  Your order number is, there's a new one.  It will be shipped to you within three days, within the next three to five business days, to the following address.  Shore Road, Brooklyn, New York. 
[02:08:30]  They are, I gotta jump in because they are fucking,  I went through this about three months ago, where I didn't have my desktop for a month and a half.  Yeah.  Because I had a problem with the electrical thing.  They sent me a new, the same thing.  Fucking Indians who, not people in this country.  They don't speak English.  What you gotta do is take, can I have your name please?  I take down every name.  Every name, and I referenced it to the next person.  I spoke to Dorothy.  It's representative 77888 Satyendra. 
[02:09:00]  It's one name.  There isn't even a last name here.  It's Satyendra.  Dell, if there's anybody that subscribes to XM, that listens, that has anything to do with Dell,  you're killing your business.  The business is dying.  Your computer business is dying.  I went to the Dell forums last night.  On their website, they have the forums.  Nothing but complaint after complaint, the same things that are happening to me.  You're saving money by outsourcing to India, and you're losing customers in droves. 
[02:09:30]  You are losing so much more than you are saving by outsourcing.  You're destroying your reputation and destroying your company.  When that commercial for Dell comes on, where the guy is in bed,  and he's paranoid over customer service and when it's going to be available,  and he goes, what about Christmas Day?  And the guy is sitting there with the headphone on, and the Dell office is going,  we'll be here.  He goes, what about Easter?  We'll be here, sir.  And it's some American kid sitting there in an American office building. 
[02:10:00]  Bullshit!  You're full of shit, Dell.  And everybody says, I will not buy another Dell product.  But this is one of the instances where it's not a personal thing where I'm saying,  I'm not going to buy a Dell.  They're forcing me not to.  If I'm having this problem for a fan, why am I going to buy a new computer  and, God forbid, have a problem with that and be stuck without a computer?  Dude, I had the woman telling me to take my computer apart.  Yeah.  This Indian woman is telling me, you have to unscrew the back, sir.  I'm like, I am not fucking removing the back from my computer. 
[02:10:30]  It's not happening.  It's not happening.  They are ruining it.  And this is just, it's part of a bigger story with customer service.  They are destroying their reputations by outsourcing to India.  It's a great idea.  Who had this idea?  Who was the first motherfucking corporate ass dick that came up with this idea?  Guys, I got a proposition.  We put all of our customer service people in India.  Why am I talking like a 1930s movie? 
[02:11:00]  We'll put it all in India.  Wonderful.  Motherfuckers.  And you cannot get anything done anymore.  Nothing.  They are absolutely.  I had to go through XM because XM has some kind of a deal with Dell or whatever.  Oh, really?  There's something going on with XM and Dell.  Something going on.  It's a huge deal, actually.  Okay, whatever it is.  They do Elo's haircuts.  Yes.  Is that it?  They send Indian people with Down syndrome.  Well, you know something?  You know something?  It would be nice then if I had a nice Dell experience that I could then get on XM and tell people that it's a wonderful thing. 
[02:11:30]  But I'm not going to lie just because there's a relationship there.  These people have fucked me.  Basically, Dell has this thing with XM where every computer is set for XM radio and the icon's right on the screen.  Kevin Stradley got me a name of a guy I went through.  American guy, a corporate guy who works in the Dell offices who actually helped me out.  I think his name was Chad.  Helped me out a lot.  And then he actually called back to follow up.  But their customer service is despicable.  Great.  And that works for you or me when I get a hold of that guy because give me his number. 
[02:12:00]  He's going to hear something from me.  But what about the average Joe out there?  Exactly.  Jimmy, that doesn't have access to one of the real American executives.  Despicable.  Proof of poor customer service from Sarah Ross, Anthony.  Dell complains.  I guess she read an article on how bad customer service is.  Yeah.  And she writes, I would have to say that article is correct.  I'm a new Dell owner of probably four months and have already had to deal with Dell's supposedly superior customer service.  Let's just say the experience I had, I was less than impressed with.  I called Dell concerning a problem I was and still am having with my computer. 
[02:12:30]  At this time, my computer was only three months old.  I had heard before about how bad Dell's customer service was, but I thought, how bad can it really be?  Right.  So I called, and I don't remember having too long to wait.  When the lady came on the line, though, I would say that she definitely was just learning English.  Yeah.  I could barely understand a word she was saying.  It was the most frustrating conversation I had ever had in my life.  She was unable to fix my problem and actually ended up getting me to take something of my computer, my antivirus system. 
[02:13:00]  There's a typo somewhere there.  I guess, what?  What?  She had a problem?  For what reason, I don't know.  By the end of the conversation, I was nearly in tears because I was so frustrated at the fact that I couldn't understand her.  So that is my experience with Dell, blah, blah, blah.  It is such a frustrating thing because you're stuck.  First, you're stuck in that automated loop that you get in where you're trying to hit the buttons and get somebody. 
[02:13:30]  Or the worst, when you get disconnected, when you've gone through it for eight minutes, and then all of a sudden, a fucking dial tone comes up where you hear nothing.  You hear click, click, and then you hear nothing, and you're still holding.  And you're like, did I hear a hang-up click?  You wait and wait, and then all of a sudden, yeah.  Bam.  That recording, it really is a bigger problem.  Most people just have a horrible experience with customer service.  People don't know about this yet because we recorded for that 6 a.m. hour, but I was opening my mail on the air live yesterday. 
[02:14:00]  Yes, you were.  While we were taping, I should say.  And I got a bill from EasyPass.  I don't have EasyPass because I don't drive.  I got to get it, obviously.  No, you don't have EasyPass because you're lazy, and you should get EasyPass.  There's no reason you shouldn't have it.  Probably, you're right.  You live in New York.  So I went through an EasyPass toll.  It was the George Washington Bridge.  This was a very interesting thing.  They have an upper level and a lower level.  And at the last minute, I saw a sign.  It's the truth.  It happened to a ton of people that day where it said, I think it was upper level, upper level close for cash customers. 
[02:14:30]  So basically, if you have EasyPass, you can go that way.  Right.  I should have realized there was a problem because there was probably a 10-mile backup on the lower level.  But I'm looking at upper level going, wow, this is great.  And at the last second when it was too late, I saw – they probably warned me before, but I wasn't paying attention.  They said, we're only accepting EasyPass on the upper level or whatever.  Yeah.  So now it's too late.  So now I actually go through where you do pay for cash, but there's no one at the booth. 
[02:15:00]  So I sit there for a second.  Oh, boy.  And I go through, okay?  And a ton of people did the exact same thing.  I wasn't the only dummy.  And then finally a cop, because everyone is kind of waiting at the cash lane.  It's like, why isn't anyone taking our cash?  A cop on the loudspeaker, you should have read the signs.  You should have read the signs.  Basically want to say, top shit.  Yeah.  Go through EasyPass and get fined.  Yep. 
[02:15:30]  So I went on my merry way there, and I finally opened the mail yesterday, as you heard.  Yes, I saw.  And, well, they got me for not paying the toll, obviously.  And what's the toll for the GWB these days?  $6, I guess.  $6?  So you had to send in $6, I would assume.  Well, I wish it was that easy.  Oh, really?  It's not that easy?  So $6 toll?  You didn't do anything extra?  Why?  $6 toll plus $25 administrative fee.  $25 administrative fee. 
[02:16:00]  So now it's up to $31.  $31 to go across the GWB.  But then you got to times that by two because I violated this situation twice.  You went around again, and you drove through again?  So now there's another problem.  So then they show another violation.  That happens six seconds later.  Wait, because they are timed.  Yes.  So it showed one violation.  Yeah.  And then another one six seconds after that.  Six seconds right there.  You can see it for yourself.  Same toll and everything.  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[02:16:30]  I apologize to the EZPass people that I took my Learjet through the tolls.  That's something.  So now two violations.  Initial toll, $6.  $25 administrative fee.  So that's $31.  And then again, $6 plus $25 administrative fee.  $62.  $62.  That's an expensive little bridge crossing.  And then it says make checks or money orders payable to blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  And then, of course, customer service, 1-800-GO-FUCK-YOURSELF. 
[02:17:00]  So now you call it up.  So I called 1-800-GO-FUCK-YOURSELF and spent the next hour off and on trying to solve this problem,  waiting on hold, finally going into the menu.  The menu didn't help me, then being hung up on, just like everything we were just talking about.  Finally get this lady on the phone.  I'm like, I was charged twice.  In six seconds.  I was charged twice.  And they're like, oh, that happens.  Happens.  There's a glitch in the system.  I'm like, all right, here's my account number or whatever, you know. 
[02:17:30]  Can you just take off one of the charges?  So let's just get that out of the way.  Nah, can't do that.  Why?  It was your error.  It's got to be on the screen in front of you.  Yeah, if you have the sheet in front of you and you're looking at it, she's got it in front of her on a computer terminal.  She goes, can't do that.  You're going to have to write in.  You're going to have to write a letter.  No, I'm talking to you, though.  Right.  I'm like, what do you mean write a letter?  I'm actually talking to you.  Just hit some keys.  You could solve this.  You could see for yourself it was your error and solve the fucking error. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  No, you have to write a letter and circle where they charge you twice with the time and everything and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, my God.  This is why our taxes are so high.  I'm like, right.  You're looking at the same screen I am.  Well, you know, I got the paper form of this thing.  Oh, man.  So, dude, I was, as we like to say in the show, stupefy.  Yep.  And I wasn't getting anywhere.  So, all of a sudden, you know what I did?  The frustration level was just growing inside me and I'm heating up. 
[02:18:30]  I just didn't say a word.  You just stopped talking.  I just stopped talking.  For 30 or 40 seconds, my brain was just like short-circuiting.  I didn't know what to do.  And she's just waiting and I hear her breathing.  She wasn't talking either?  I hear her breathing.  Just uncomfortable silence.  She's breathing and I'm not talking and all of a sudden, she had to go 40 seconds later  because I guess they're not really allowed to hang up on you.  No.  And she just goes, hello? 
[02:19:00]  I'm like, yeah, I'm still here.  I was just a defeated man.  I'm still here.  Yeah.  And then I was silent again.  She's like, hello.  I'm like, yeah.  Did you fix it?  Did you, during our silence together, did you work on that and fix it for me?  And I'm like, well, I don't have a checking account because you just heard that.  I don't have checks to my new account.  And I don't feel like getting a stupid money order for a $6 toll because they are going  to waive the administrative fee as long as it's 15 business days, but I have to write 
[02:19:30]  that in the letter.  Of course you do.  So I just hang up on her.  Hang up.  And I just ripped the part down where you have to submit with your payment, and I just  take a $5 bill, a $1 bill, circled, said, oh, you sent cash.  Fuck yeah.  I said, charge me twice and mailed it in and let them deal with it.  You're going to get, mm-hmm.  Your form is going in the garbage. 
[02:20:00]  That $6 is going in someone's pocket.  And you are fucked.  Well, we'll see what happens.  You might as well send it to KFC because that's where it's going.  And some fatso's having lunch on your dime.  That's probably why you have to do the money orders and the checks so they have a record,  right?  What do you think?  Five?  Taping quarters to a box top?  Dude, if I could have got away with it, I would have given them $6 worth of pennies.  $6 in cash you sent.  Yeah.  And you know that it's just, you know who works there. 
[02:20:30]  You know who opens those letters.  There's somebody who could really use the $6.  So basically, though, some stupid thing that obviously I should have picked up on at the  time, but I didn't and a lot of people didn't, is now this thing.  That should have been taken care of, though, on the phone.  Right.  You obviously could not have gone through the same toll within six seconds.  They see it in front of her.  Exact toll.  At least that one should have been wiped out right there with her at the screen.  Yeah, they got a code and everything.  It's the same code for the same, it's obviously their error. 
[02:21:00]  So this stupid little thing that should have been nothing is now, now it's a problem.  That's what customer service is now.  Stupid little thing, should be nothing, big problem.  You know what the beauty of being on the radio is, and this is because I hate these people  so, when Dell, you want to bite somebody's face, is that we're on in 50 states.  You figure there's a lot of people that buy computers.  If you can just get five people in every state, five, to not buy a Dell, I averaged it out.  That's 250 people in the country, say, for a year. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  How much is a computer?  800 bucks?  Yeah, average.  More than that, probably, some of them, but if it's 800 bucks a computer, that's $200,000.  There you go.  It costs you, you shitheads.  That's what you get.  Yeah, because your stupid customer service cost-cutting measure.  Five people in every state decide to buy something else.  Because I like Dell.  Dell has to get up to $46,000 for me to make some money back.  Good luck.  I like Dell.  Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.  Screw them, man. 
[02:22:00]  And I've been buying Dells for years, man.  Years.  Every year, at least, I buy another Dell computer.  And they're just screwing me.  And by the way, because I only spoke in code when the phone rang earlier, I'm just trying  to close a joint account out.  A joint checking account.  40 large in there?  Nah, I lucked out, actually.  A little overdrawing was going on.  But besides that, that should have been...  How long do you think it should take to close out an old checking account?  To close a bank account? 
[02:22:30]  How about...  Could you close this account?  How long was that?  Three seconds?  Dude, I'm up to three days already.  Three days.  I'm up to three days.  Something, like I said, these simple tasks that we all have to deal with are just becoming  nightmares on a daily basis for everybody.  It's like, yeah, it should have been one call.  Three days.  How to wait for checks to clear.  How to wait for activity at ATM machines.  You have to wait 24 hours for that.  And then finally, yesterday, when it was supposed to be all done, they go, oh, we closed the wrong 
[02:23:00]  account.  Oh, good.  My new checking account that has my cash in it.  Uh-oh.  Is that the one?  Now, what about the checks that went out on that account?  Did you have any checks?  Outstanding?  I don't know.  Because they'll probably bounce.  Yeah.  Well, so they closed that account.  I'm like, all right, well, no big deal, right?  Well, yeah, it is.  Now, you've got to wait 24 hours before you could have that checking account back.  Oh, great.  Thank you for the inconvenience. 
[02:23:30]  Right.  Thank you.  Something that should have taken two minutes is up to three days.  Three days.  Just one.  Three days.  Oh.  And then I, you know, I actually owe Club Sort of Kenny money and stuff, and I've got  to write them a check, you know?  I haven't had checks.  I ordered checks probably two months ago.  I still don't have them.  I finally called them, and they're like, oh, we forgot to check that box when you were  in here.  I just ordered checks, by the way, and my order was canceled. 
[02:24:00]  You know why?  The address I gave was not the same address that my bank account has.  I checked my bank account.  It's the same address.  I get a letter yesterday from my bank saying, well, we've changed your address.  Here it is.  And now it's got my new address.  I've been at my new address for a year, and I've given my address to them.  They've had it on file.  I've written checks.  I've used my card. 
[02:24:30]  I've put the address on it.  But for some reason, there is such shit going on out there.  I don't know what happened.  I think corporate America just lost their minds.  They're trying so hard to save money.  Dude, it happens around here.  I mean, we're doing a dumb radio show.  There was so much paperwork involved.  We've talked about that as far as the show goes.  But in general, it's like, well, to do this, have him fill out this form, this form, and  this, and this, and then check this, this, and this.  And if these aren't all checked, then he should fill out this form. 
[02:25:00]  They just have made and invented way too many forms where anywhere along the way, something  can happen that fucks up the whole thing.  Something can screw up, and it does.  Right.  It's not, they made it too complicated, too many hands in there, and they're trying to  make it cheaper.  It doesn't work.  That outsourcing is destroying customer service.  Just wrecking it.  You know, it's pretty good, and I know they outsource, I think they outsource anyway.  Does Mac outsource? 
[02:25:30]  Does anybody know?  Apple?  I really don't know.  No?  Incompatible shit that they have.  You know what?  Yeah.  Well, people have asked, why don't you have a Mac?  I have a Mac.  I use Mac for graphics and video and stuff like that, but their website's great.  You go to their website, you want an answer to something, you can find it easily, you need  a product, you could order it online through a Mac, and it's great.  Unfortunately, I like to play games other than, like, the five that are available for fucking  Mac, so I have to have my Windows.  If they were more compatible, I'd probably get one, because they are good for graphics and 
[02:26:00]  stuff like that.  You know something?  You can't just have a Mac.  You need a Mac and a Windows.  It's just the world we live in, if you're into graphics and stuff.  All right.  Let's go to the phone here.  Terry in Philly.  Go ahead, Terry.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi.  Terry, the guy.  How are you, guys?  Hey, I called XM last Saturday.  I was riding in my car.  I got a bunch of XM accounts.  One of them's in my car.  A lot of them in my car is in one's in my computer at home.  So I'm enjoying live.  You know, it's pretty cool.  You go from channel to channel.  You listen to stadium to stadium.  Yeah, they really did a great job with the coverage, by the way. 
[02:26:30]  Unbelievable.  Excellent on the regular car radio.  So I go home.  I'm excited.  The wife's away.  The kids are away.  I'm going to join myself on my laptop, listen to XM.  Here, they don't have it on the computer for some reason.  So I call up customer service.  I get some Hindu or some dancing.  She doesn't know what the hell is going on.  She says, oh, I don't know what's going on.  I said, well, why don't you know?  And then I said to them, I said, well, why don't you have all the channels on XM on your  computer?  She didn't know any answer to that.  So that Eric Logan's listening.  Does he think if I spend like 50 bucks a month or 60 bucks a month on all these computers 
[02:27:00]  for an extra six bucks, wouldn't I want to have all the channels on my laptop?  Like, isn't that the stupid...  Like, you talk about the radio guys.  Isn't he pretty stupid?  Nah, Elo's actually pretty smart.  Isn't that pretty dumb, though, that you don't have that on your laptop?  Most guys use their laptop for their music systems.  It's funny, stupid me.  I did call XM customer service to get one of my XM units, you know, activated.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to...  I'm like, dude, I'm Opie from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:27:30]  We're pretty much on every box right now.  You go to Best Buy right now, you see my name.  Yeah.  It's right...  It's one of the highlights of the whole system.  I'm that guy.  And I still couldn't get anything done.  I could not get my unit activated.  I'm like, I'm Opie...  Guess what my head is.  He calls in.  And the funny thing is, the person, you know, she didn't even know the name of the show.  And I'm not expecting that, but when we're on every box, you would think, hello, if you're 
[02:28:00]  working for the company, you might know the product, or you might want to know the product.  This lady didn't know shit.  So I had to give up.  The whiteys, get the bombs.  The whiteys, get the bombs.  All right.  Thank you.  We have Beyond Frustrated.  It says, recently I had a cell phone company return my check because my account was on hold.  My account was on hold because I didn't pay my bill.  They can't accept a payment until the hold is removed.  To remove the hold, you must make a full payment. 
[02:28:30]  That is...  That's perfect.  It's a perfect example.  I'm talking about the simple tasks that have become just a complete nightmare.  Pain in the ass.  And I guess Apple doesn't outsource customer service.  Good.  Very good.  Hope they keep it that way.  Because I know Microsoft does.  They're another one that you'll get frigging India.  Why'd they pick India?  Is it just the cheap, filthy labor?  Is that what it is?  I'm Dorothy.  No, you're not.  Stop it. 
[02:29:00]  Hello.  My name is Pete.  No, it's not.  It is not Pete.  It's Sanji.  Here's a rule of thumb.  When I'm getting computer help, I don't want the person helping me to have come to work on a yak.  If you rode livestock to work, I don't want you helping me with my fucking computer.  With some futuristic device like a computer.  Oh, that's hilarious.  If I eat a burger and you're probably going to worship it, you're not qualified to help me.  Let's see.  Let's go to John.  Go ahead, John. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hi, John.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, just so you know, people are getting fucking speeding tickets sent to them for easy pass.  We're going between the tolls too fast.  I got a friend of mine who got a fucking ticket for going five miles over between two fucking tolls.  I heard about that, but I don't believe it.  No, they do do it.  No, I don't believe it.  I've heard about it and heard that it's possible and stuff, but they're not doing that yet.  I've got warnings going through the toll booth too quickly, but not from point A to point B too fast. 
[02:30:00]  I've been yelled at by the fucking guys where you whiz right through.  Especially in New York, they have the gates still at the toll booths.  I don't know why they have those frigging things.  Pull them out.  Jersey, no gates.  You just go.  But they have the gates, and I like the thing to actually skim my windshield wiper when I go through.  I like for the gate to come up and actually touch my windshield wiper as I zip right through.  And I have just been yelled at by the cops.  I'm fully expecting that to happen, though, where they just start mailing speeding tickets in the mail. 
[02:30:30]  It's possible because what a moneymaker that will be.  If they know how many miles it is between point A and point B, and you have a record of when you cross those two points,  they could absolutely get your speed.  I fully expect that to happen.  It would just wreck the easy pass system, though, because people would stop using it.  And they haven't started doing that yet.  That would be a huge story.  And believe me, they'd be handing out tickets.  Everyone would get one.  I'd have 50 tickets.  Jimmy in Staten Island.  Yo, oh, hey.  Jimmy, how you doing, guys?  Two things. 
[02:31:00]  First of all, never underestimate the power of the cycle factor.  And number two, I'm the guy that told Fat Nick his Escalade.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, I am.  Good boy.  Yeah?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, it came with the Cousine package with the heated seats memory package and the Louisville slugger.  Punch it up.  Oh, boy.  Let's go to Howard Beach.  Mikey.  Yo.  What's up, Mikey?  Yo, I bought a laptop from Dell. 
[02:31:30]  And the fucking thing crashed.  I called up Dell customer service.  And I got some sand nigger on the phone.  Oh, jeez.  Well, wait, wait, wait.  Hold it, Mike.  Hold it.  Where are you from?  Howard Beach.  All right.  That makes perfect sense now.  I had a look and see where you were from before I could.  I wasn't sure if it was Boston or Howard Beach.  Yeah.  Thanks for correcting us.  That's great.  You're really busting apart those stereotypes there, Mike.  Yeah, right.  So, you know, they have me on there for like two hours.  Do this.  Do that.  Reload this.  Reboot that. 
[02:32:00]  Call me back.  I do all the things.  I call him back.  The fucking thing crashed.  Then I finally get a white guy on.  I thought that I was going to get something with him.  He did the same thing over and over and over and over again.  I got so fucking frustrated.  I had the thing for like three months.  And I said, you know what?  Just give me my fucking money back.  I was paying it off.  And I said, just give me my money back.  Fuck this.  Give me my money.  I took it.  I just use it now to just beat spooks over the fucking head with it when they come into  our neighborhood, huh?  That's about what it was good for.  Gee.  How are things over there in Howard Beach, Mike? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, they're cool.  Yeah.  You know, I got shopping over here doing marches.  You're driving around with any words of support on your car?  No, no, no.  I don't have any soap written on my window.  Have you seen any?  What?  Any words of support written on other people's cars?  Oh, yeah, a couple.  Like what?  You know, the same old free fat Nick and that type of shit.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'll punch it out.  Have fun over there.  Jesus Christ.  Howard Beach. 
[02:33:00]  A couple more, then we'll break here.  Eric in Colorado.  Eric?  Morning, boys.  Morning, Eric.  Morning.  I can top all your customer service bitches.  Two years ago, my pickup, I was in a small, I was in a minor accident and one of the brackets  for my grill guard got bit.  I have been waiting two fucking years for new brackets.  Why?  Because they have sent me, four times they've sent me the wrong brackets. 
[02:33:30]  I finally told them, I said, I gave them everything correct.  I even sent the guy the original brackets so he knew what I was talking about.  And they still, not only did they return the bent brackets, but the new brackets were still  the wrong brackets.  I finally went back and go and have new brackets.  It's custom made.  It cost me $1,000 to have four brackets custom made.  I only paid $300 for the grill guard to begin with.  See?  It has been a long, drawn, and the worst part about it is... 
[02:34:00]  Oh, my God.  Sounds like I'm on customer service with this guy.  The company is in America.  The technical and customer support guy is in America.  He speaks perfect English.  Yeah, but how many times did you actually send back and forth with the brackets?  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy!  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Eric.  For to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the Fruit Roll-Up factory.  Making a Fruit Roll-Up. 
[02:34:30]  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that's so much better than your American...  Because I...  You know, what do you...  Let me just...  Well, you already know, but...  You don't want to work.  Work good for you.  Right?  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad, and it stunk so bad.  You fat American.  Right?  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should need to know.  Okay, back to work.

[02:38:30]  Thanks for your help with that.  Damn right.  Getting your ticket.  We have Isaac Hayes entering the studio as we speak.  Best known as the voice of Chef on South Park.  Is that his best known?  Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  In 2004, Hayes appeared in a recurring minor role as the Jaffa Tullock on the television series Stargate SG-1.  The following year, he appeared in the critically acclaimed independent film Hustle & Flow. 
[02:39:00]  Hayes is also an outspoken Scientologist.  The top-selling Hot Buttered Salt 1969 was a breakthrough album.  Hi, Isaac.  How are you?  Yeah, I'm right.  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  What's up?  Good morning.  All right.  He has the greatest voice of all time.  That's it, man.  We're just reading your bio as you were settling in.  And it goes on and on and on and on.  You could sing with it and talk with it.  That voice.  It's amazing.  Nice, deep. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Must have gotten the ladies back in the day, right?  Still does, obviously.  I mean, back.  I'm married to my fourth wife now.  Six months married.  Fourth wife?  All right.  We're going to start there.  And a child is on the way.  A child's on the way.  I can talk about back in the day, but that's back in the day.  It's not now.  Right.  That was in another unit of time.  Isaac, we understand this, and you prefaced it very nicely.  I was mad.  As to keep yourself safe.  But it must have just been as easy as, hey, baby, you won't go back in my place.  And it's over, Johnny, right? 
[02:40:00]  My crib and yours, baby.  Like the Pied Piper, the chicks are just following him home.  You can just tell with that voice.  That's gold, that voice.  But what are you doing with four wives?  Well, you know, like I said, keep trying and trying until you get it right.  No, no.  Getting it right is not doing it again.  After the show, all right, let's say the first one.  Now, I'll give everyone one because I even have one.  Look, man, I was green as, can I say this?  You can say anything.  I was green as goose shit. 
[02:40:30]  And goose shit is quite green.  How old were you when you got married the first time?  I was 19.  I was green, man.  Oh, no.  I was a country boy.  That's just dumb.  Crazy.  Had been anywhere.  That's just dumb.  You know.  What did you get?  Well, where were you?  I was in Memphis, Tennessee.  So you're in Memphis.  You meet a nice young lady.  Yeah.  You decide that's the whole world.  You don't know what the hell's going on out there.  Right.  You get married, and then all of a sudden, oh, man.  Oh.  An awakening.  When I start working at Stacks, me and David Portis are writing his songs.  Chicks, chicks everywhere.  And you're like, what did I do? 
[02:41:00]  We're the smallest boy.  So now, I can understand that happening.  You're like Superman, growing up in Smallville, and all of a sudden, you find out what Metropolis  is like.  I'm a Metropolis.  That's it.  Right.  So I'll give you that.  Why, then, you get divorced, obviously.  What makes you do it, number two?  Another one came along.  Well, they'll always come along.  They just keep on coming, Isaac.  It took me a long time to ripen.  I was green.  It's good shit.  I told you.  Yeah, but a first wife won't only ripen you. 
[02:41:30]  She'll put a few bruises on the skin.  That's right.  And make you taste a little mealy.  But this girl had some nice ointment.  Oh, is that it?  It soothed my bruises.  You know what I'm saying?  So you marry her.  Yeah.  And kids with the first wife?  Yeah, I got two.  Two with the first wife.  But I had one before the first wife.  Oh, okay.  So before you got married, you had one.  How old were you for the first one?  Well-  First kid now.  They were very close.  I mean, I was 19, and my kids were months apart. 
[02:42:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  So now you got some kids, then you get the first wife, you have a couple more kids,  and then the second wife.  Hold on, I'm keeping track.  Three kids with the second wife.  All right, hold on.  Give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  My goodness.  Hold on.  I got it.  You are working.  One kid out of wedlock.  Damn.  This guy's from-  Jimmy just got pregnant, just from sitting next to Isaac.  One kid out of wedlock.  Two kids with the first marriage. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Now you got three with the second.  With the first.  Three more kids with the second.  Now, what happened with the second marriage?  And what year was this about?  How were you-  That was around-  Were you hitting?  Around 60.  The second one was around 65.  65?  Yeah.  And what are you doing for a living back in 65?  I was writing songs.  Writing songs?  Working at Stax, yeah.  Side musician, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So what happened now with the second one?  Where'd that go wrong?  Well-  We're educating our listeners. 
[02:43:00]  Well, it went on the rocks.  Mm-hmm.  I don't want to go into detail, but-  I don't need detail, but-  But, you know, she-  I mean, this one really took my heart and ripped it out and jumped up and down.  Oh, stamped it.  Stomped on it?  Oh, man.  All right.  In other words, maybe a little karma came around, and like, because of what happened with  the first marriage, the second one kind of made you feel a little, you know.  No, but look, I was good.  I was definitely-  I was green, you'll tell you.  Yeah.  And like I said in Phoenix, you know, hey, I did the right thing. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  But it just didn't happen right for me.  And the second one, I was crazy mad in love with that man.  And I felt like committing suicide.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  When it went bad.  And, but my band members talked to me and everything and saved me from, you know, driving  into a tree.  They said there's a lot of pussy on that road.  So you hang in there, Isaac.  They got together and went, if Isaac kills himself, we're fucked. 
[02:44:00]  We're gonna pay the electric bill.  I'm talking meal ticket here, my friend.  You're getting this guy alive.  I had it so bad.  Every woman that looked like her, I went for her.  Really?  I had it so bad.  How long were you with her?  What'd she look like?  Oh, she was awesome.  What'd she look like?  You got like an actress maybe or something?  And she was, she was, she was high yellow.  Yeah?  You know.  High yellow?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And she had legs and she had all that. 
[02:44:30]  From there to there, right?  That's right.  That's right.  Nice ass bam.  All of that.  Yeah.  And when I finally recovered from that, then I, David Porter introduced me, my co-writing  buddy, introduced me to my third wife.  All right.  Here we go.  The third wife.  Now, how long after the second was the third?  Like, did you meet her?  Enough time went by where you were able to get over the second wife? 
[02:45:00]  Well, I met her when the other one, when the second went bad.  See, the brother needed something.  The brother needed a life, boy.  You were so in love with this girl.  No, no, no.  But the morning took about a week.  No, no, no, no, no.  It was a long time.  All right.  And then when I met my third wife, I was straight.  I went, David's, come on, let's go, let's go, we had a way to write in D.C.  Went and wrote, that's when we wrote a lot of hit songs for Sam and Dave. 
[02:45:30]  And I met him, David had a girlfriend already.  She was a friend of David.  Oops.  No, he's a divorced man now.  It's all safe.  So, so.  Isaac Hayes blowing up everyone's song.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They divorced twice now, anyway.  All right, got it.  So, so David said, come on, man.  I went to D.C. with David.  And he said, so-and-so is coming over to meet you, man. 
[02:46:00]  I said, okay.  So my door, in the hotel, nobody locked on my door.  I opened the door.  She said, I said, hey.  I said, yeah.  She reached her hand out.  I shook her hand.  I said, come on in.  She had a big, long coat on.  And she turned around to me to take her coat off.  I left the coat off.  Bam!  I said, oh, God.  Naked, right?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I'm in trouble.  With that ass up high, right?  Oh.  Right, Isaac?  Come on.  That's when those first minutes came out.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  God.  Isaac, instantly, out of instinct, dropped to one knee and gave her a ring. 
[02:46:30]  No, no, no, no.  No?  No, I was strong.  I was strong.  No, no.  We talked that night and blah, blah, blah, blah.  All that.  And then she was straight to go.  And David heard the door slamming.  We had a door in the room.  Hey, man.  How'd you do?  That's my plan.  I'm not playing, man.  I said, I'm straight.  She was nice.  She looked good and everything.  So anyway, they're supposed to come the next night.  We're supposed to start writing at a restaurant in D.C. upstairs. 
[02:47:00]  And she didn't show up.  And I got pissed.  Not that I was going to do anything, but it's like a disrespect thing.  And so I said, man, I'm going home.  No, I can't.  You can't leave, man.  If you go, I have to go.  I said, I'm going home, sucker.  So I went on home.  Went back home.  And a couple of days later, she called me.  Hey, what?  I said, I got a cold.  They said, she got a cold, man.  You know, she needed some medicine and stuff. 
[02:47:30]  I said, okay, I'm sorry.  You got a cold and everything.  So then.  And that's why she didn't show up.  No.  She tried to give me that excuse.  Yeah.  Now she's going for the excuse.  Wait, were you famous yet?  I was famous songwriter.  Yeah.  So then she said, she called one night, she said, I'm at a party.  I want to go home.  Will you call when I get home?  I called her.  She got home.  Hey, I need a, I need, it's a coat I saw in some department store. 
[02:48:00]  Will you buy that for me?  Jesus.  I said, who in the hell you think I am?  Yeah.  Who in the fuck?  You know, so man, she said, hey, nobody ever talked to me like that.  I want to see you.  Oh, she was digging it.  Yeah.  I want to see you.  So now my, my other man was just kicking me in the butt.  So I was so beat up, you know, so I said, well, I took, I took a plane and flew back  up there and saw her and that's when I, that's when I, I got locked. 
[02:48:30]  So things happened, let's just say.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, you, you, you were hooked up with her and now that's the third wife.  Yeah.  We were, we were together for nine years.  Nine years.  So you got to have what?  Nine, 10 kids.  We got three kids.  Three kids.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  We got two kids out of that one.  All right.  Two kids.  Yeah.  Out of that.  Okay.  Two kids out of that.  And then in the meantime.  He's up to eight kids.  In the meantime.  Eight kids, four different women.  Wow.  In the meantime.  God bless you. 
[02:49:00]  I sired, uh, one, two.  Yeah.  I think, let me count now.  Three.  Yeah.  Two kids.  Two kids.  Two more outside of any of the wives.  Exactly.  Ones we haven't counted yet?  Yeah.  All right.  So two more.  Add two.  Two more.  Two more out of wedlock.  And that was at between marriages or kind of during marriages a couple of times?  When the marriages start going on the rocks.  Right.  Starts going on the rocks.  It's a gray area.  Right.  It's a gray area.  It's called on the rocks.  That Isaac's a bad mother. 
[02:49:30]  What's your count?  What's your count now?  I'm up to, uh, ten, I believe.  And one on the way now with the fourth wife.  No, ten on the way.  Ten, ten, okay.  You don't even know how many kids you have?  I have to tell you.  No, no, no.  I know.  I mean, I'm just keep, keep up with the times.  Is it about right?  Yeah, that's right.  Okay.  And then that was, um, after, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, the third one started going bad.  Right.  And then that was, um, that was, uh, that was another one.  My youngest. 
[02:50:00]  Another wedlock?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's, that's 11, isn't it?  That's 11.  Wait, so now we got three out of wedlock?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's 11.  All right, we got 11 kids.  And, and, uh, and, uh, and I stayed single for a long time.  Yeah.  About 20 years.  I said, I ain't never this anymore.  Never.  But then I went to Ghana, West Africa.  And I met this, uh-oh.  Oh, no.  An African woman?  Oh, yes.  Oh, you're in trouble.  See, I hear about you guys.  You go there, you get all spiritual and shit. 
[02:50:30]  You go to the motherland.  I went to the motherland.  And then all of a sudden, you're like.  Trust me.  Oh, I'm not gone, boy, Isaac.  These chicks start clicking at you.  No, that's, that's Plaza.  I'm talking, Ghana is, is Western Africa.  Yeah.  See, Plaza is South Africa.  Ah, you were in West Africa.  West Africa.  What, like north?  No, no, no.  Just West Africa.  Just West, you know, Ghana is on that, on that Cape.  Uh-huh.  You know, um.  The little bulge that comes out of there?  Yeah, it comes out on the underside. 
[02:51:00]  Underside of that one.  It's, it's, it's, it's bordered on the south by the Atlantic Ocean.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  And it's bordered on the west, on, let me say, on the east by the Volta River.  And they made, they made me, I became a king over there.  A king, King Isaac Hayes.  My name is Nindia Cartel Council of the First.  That was in 92.  No shit.  When I saw this girl, man, I thought she was Indian, because she had that look, man.  And she was starting to become a, uh, aerobics instructor.  She and another girl.  And she was just dying. 
[02:51:30]  Isn't aerobics just natural over there?  You gotta run away from fucking lions and shit?  It's like, it's like aerobics.  It's called living.  But trust me, it's not like, like, it's not like a Tarzan story or none of that kind of shit.  No?  Those people are wonderful.  And, uh, she, she took down her hair and shook her head, and I said, oh, shit.  I fell down past her shoulders.  I said, oh, my God.  I was instantly smitten again.  Again.  Again.  20 years, you're single, and now you go to Africa, and now you're all, you're getting all tied up again. 
[02:52:00]  But this girl, I mean, this girl, she was, she was tough.  This is the one, right, Isaac?  Yeah.  She, she made me wait.  I mean, she put my ethics in.  I mean, that was back in 92.  We just got married.  Did she know who you were?  No.  She didn't care.  I don't care who you are.  I don't.  Yeah.  No, she, no, she, she, she had a head on straight.  Mm-hmm.  And you got one on the way with her, so that'll make 12 kids.  12 kids.  With, wow.  And guess what?  12 kids with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight different women. 
[02:52:30]  I got 16 grandkids.  16 grandkids.  16 grandkids.  And, and, and three, three great grands.  Holy.  Call me John Appleseed.  Yeah, kid.  No.  Isaac, how old are you?  I'm 63.  Wow.  Holy.  You don't look 60.  Doesn't he look great?  You don't look.  I'm a health fanatic, man.  Yeah, what do you do?  He fucks all day.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm telling you, no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm straight 
[02:53:00]  now, and it took me a long time to find myself.  Were you ever, uh, doing a lot of drugs or anything?  No, never did that.  You never did.  Thank God I never did.  Didn't have time to do drugs.  During the, yeah, right?  You want to do some, uh, drugs, fuck that?  Hang on, gotta have sex over here.  Gotta make another kid.  Never got, I fell into the drugs, though.  No, never did.  See, because working backstage behind the scenes, David Porter and I, we saw various artists  and saw how artists did and saw how they had destroyed their lives. 
[02:53:30]  I said, no, I'm never going down that road.  Mm-hmm.  Never did.  What are the rumors now about them doing, uh, uh, more work with you and Donald Pleasance?  Any?  Donald Pleasance?  Escape from New York now?  Yeah.  No, Donald, you know Donald, Donald dropped his body a few years ago.  Oh, he died?  I didn't know that.  Donald Pleasance has died, uh, a couple of years ago.  I didn't know that.  Someone died, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Jesus.  I didn't know that.  I'm sorry, Isaac.  I'm sorry, Isaac.  I didn't know.  I'm sorry, Isaac.  Jimmy knows nothing.  Jimmy's been to Mars or something.  He took a vacation.  No, because he is so self-centered that unless it's been involving him directly, he has no 
[02:54:00]  clue.  That's a piece of work that I love very much, and that dummy right there was telling me  that they were actually thinking of doing a sequel, and I'm like, really?  Like they couldn't do it without Donald Pleasance.  Wait, now you took what E-Rock told you, you were trying to make it your own, and now you can  blame E-Rock.  But that was what he said.  That was what he said.  Now, this is the second Escape from New York.  You know, Escape from L.A.  Yeah.  I tried to get into that one, but I'm glad I didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah, that wasn't as good as the first one.  Yeah, you were very good at that.  Let's go to Darren. 
[02:54:30]  First film.  Darren, what's up?  What's up, Owen?  Hey, Darren.  How are you doing, Jimmy?  Welcome back, bro.  Thank you.  Listen, my question is for Isaac Hayes.  Yo.  What are your child support payments like?  Do you pay child support?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I've gone through that.  Oh, man.  I got three, and I'm like...  It caused me a fortune, man.  Trust me.  I'm doing a math over here.  Now, it's a good thing that some of them have kind of aged out, but then you go and get  back into the fine past.  Yeah, but, you know, I never was a deadbeat dad.  I took care of all my kids. 
[02:55:00]  I know where they are.  That's beautiful.  That's beautiful.  I stay in touch with them, and I even give my grandkids gifts for Christmas.  You know, in fact, the kids are grown now, so I give my grandkids gifts.  I mean, I'm into literacy and education, so I buy them gifts from Toys R Us, the little  ones, and the older ones, I give them gifts from department stores, and I give them all  gifts to bookstores, because I want them to read.  Mm-hmm.  And I'll just make sure they're illiterate.  All right.  Thanks, Darren.  Okay.  Let's go to Tony in Wisconsin.  Tony. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, my question is for Isaac Hayes.  Yo.  Hey, what did you think?  You're Scientologists, right?  Yeah.  Okay, what did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on South Park about Scientology?  Well, what?  With Cruz in the closet.  Yeah, that was a great episode.  One thing about Matt and Trey, they lampoon everybody.  Mm-hmm.  And if you take that shit serious, then I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge for $2.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  You got to realize what they're doing.  Yeah, that's what they do.  And take it.  That's what they do.  What is Scientology all about?  I still don't understand it.  You still don't understand?  It's UFOs and stuff.  No.  It's cleansing the body.  I really don't.  I don't understand it, though.  That's all.  But I don't understand the Catholic faith either.  There's bad things that are in there for years and years and years.  No, Scientology is an applied religious philosophy.  See, people get it all mixed up.  And all I say is, you know, read a book.  Read about it.  We got books that explain all about it. 
[02:56:30]  And when I got into Scientology, I was just like everybody else.  I heard you guys.  I was going on hearsay.  And the lady told me, she said, look, why don't you take a course and see for yourself?  When I took a course, the first course called Overcoming Ups and Downs in Life, and I took  that course halfway through the course.  I said, damn, I'm learning something.  Shit.  I was finding answers about me, about life that I had never known. 
[02:57:00]  And then I took another course.  I wanted to take another course so bad, but I wouldn't give it a satisfaction.  I was blown away.  I said, well, I'm going to take another course to see what, you know.  So I took another course called Personal Values and Integrity.  And when I did that, that's when I decided to become a Scientologist.  See, that seems all well and fine, you know, because that sounds like things that a lot  of people can use and utilize in their daily lives.  Yeah.  When does it start getting controversial? 
[02:57:30]  When, how many, like, courses in do they start telling you about the Thetans and things  that are like, that's, because that's when they lose people.  The proper word is Thetan.  Thetan.  In Greek terminology, that means spirit.  Right.  We're all spiritual beings.  The bodies are just mess, matter in the space and time, the physical universe.  But we're all spiritual beings, which, which, the spirit never dies.  Mm-hmm.  Messed is just like this paper here, like the desk we're sitting at. 
[02:58:00]  That's all messed.  But the spirit stays.  And where does it go when we die?  The spirit just doesn't go anywhere.  It doesn't go anywhere.  We just pick up other bodies.  I ain't going to get into all that, but that's what happens.  Man, I want to get into your body with all the women you're back in.  Yeah, I believe in reincarnation, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is that part of the Scientology philosophy of reincarnation?  Yeah.  It is?  But it validated my theory, because I believed in reincarnation before I heard about Scientology, and that just fortified my belief in reincarnation. 
[02:58:30]  See, it's totally cool.  I don't care whatever gets everybody through their day.  You know, if they want to sit there and pray to a stick or, you know, any type of religion you want to...  No, but see, somebody talking about a stick.  As long as it makes you happy.  Yeah, but that's bullshit, to pay to a stick.  No, see, people come with all kinds...  You know, when a new religion comes into being, you get all kinds of rumors about what blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:59:00]  But the thing about it is, it's very, very ethical.  And those that don't have ethics, they get pissed and go and make all kinds of lies and do all kinds of stuff like that.  And people that don't know, they believe it.  That's why I say, read it.  Check it out for yourself.  Don't listen to what Joe says.  Check it out for yourself.  Do they request a certain percentage of income?  That's a rumor that goes around on Scientology, too. 
[02:59:30]  No.  Okay, so it's a rumor.  No, that's bullshit, too.  And when I went there, I said, I hear y'all take folks money.  I was talking shit like everybody else did.  Then I felt like an idiot when I found out I wasn't like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were you guys all freaking, though, about Tom Cruise?  I mean, he kind of blew his mouth off.  No, no, Tom is cool.  Tom is cool.  Yeah, because he was making things look a little bad for a little while.  Well, see, what Tom did, Tom attacked the world of psychology, the psychs.  He saved, just by getting on Oprah talking, he saved the lives of maybe 400,000 kids that 
[03:00:00]  were taking those psych drugs.  Yeah, but they forced it on him.  Some people think that might work, and others say it doesn't.  No, no, no.  And I think that's where Scientology, where people start going like, oh, brother, people  like Tom Cruise get out there, and they bash psychology and certain psychotropic drugs  that work for people.  Well, think about that.  They, every kid, I would say 99% of the kids that go off and shoot their classes up and 
[03:00:30]  all this kind of shit, like Columbine, they have had some kind of psychiatric influence.  They have.  And I could give you the history of psychology, I mean psychiatry, but all you got to do is  visit our headquarters of CCHR, Citizens Commission on Human Rights.  Visit them, and they'll give you a whole tour, and give you the history of psychiatry.  You know what history of psychiatry I had that kept me from shooting up a school or cursing 
[03:01:00]  out a teacher or something like that?  It was called the back of my father's hand.  That drug worked great.  It was a smack, and I didn't do it anymore.  Well, see, I went through that too, but think of those who did not, that the psychs got to  them and give them Ritalin and Prozac and all this kind of shit.  That's what messed them up.  And remember the days of the hippies and stuff, LSD and all this kind of shit?  Yeah.  That was psych influence. 
[03:01:30]  They were experimenting on us.  You think that was like government experiments?  Well, I don't know about government, but it was psych, wherever they had influence, and  they probably had influence on our government.  The stuff came out of-  Like drug companies and-  Yeah, those guys.  They're getting all the money.  Yeah.  That's where the money's going.  Well, I got to give them that.  The drug companies do really seem to be pushing a lot of that stuff out there these days.  Yeah.  All the commercials on TV, anything you want to do.  Are you saying the drug companies don't have integrity? 
[03:02:00]  I don't buy it.  You never have.  He's been on Mars again.  He's been on Mars again.  What do you do?  You got a headache?  You take an aspirin or something like that?  No, I don't.  You don't?  No, no.  You take nothing.  No, no, no.  See what I do?  You're shit.  That's what you do.  Get all that junk out of you.  You take a dump.  Clean yourself.  That's what Opie said.  That's it.  Isaac.  Clean yourself out.  Yep.  You ever take a Vicodin?  That shit is so good.  What's that?  Vicodin?  You take it and you just go like- 
[03:02:30]  Is it a laxative?  No, no, no.  It's like a muscle relaxer.  It's one of those pills like Oxycontin and all those drugs that all the actors get addicted to.  I don't mess with those drugs.  I stay with you.  No, no.  I don't mess with them.  I know, but-  But occasionally you like poppin' one.  You take pain medicine though, right?  What if you had a toothache and it was pounded?  No, if it's so bad.  Because that's what they gave me.  If it's so bad.  I've had tooth surgery.  I take the drugs in if it's so bad.  Yeah.  But, you know, I didn't get that out of me. 
[03:03:00]  We got a thing in Scientology called, you can get all that stuff out of you.  Get out of it.  Oh, yes, you do.  We cleanse and they get the prescription drugs.  You get the street drugs.  You get insecticides, pesticides, radiation poisoning.  Get all that out of you.  That's right.  Let me ask you a question.  This is something, like you say, when it gets so bad, you got to take something from pain. 
[03:03:30]  So what's the difference between that and, say, something psychological where for someone  who can't do it any other way, like legitimately can't, for them it's so bad they have to take  something.  So I'm saying, like, what's the difference between one or the other?  Good point, Jimmy.  Good point.  Wait, now, you mean when people have, if the pain is so bad?  With a threshold for whatever it is, like for me it would be like an abscessed tooth or  whatever, you got to take some kind of a pain medication.  So with psychology, like, you know, there are some cases where I'm sure it's prescribed 
[03:04:00]  wrong, but what if it's legitimate and for them the pain is so bad or whatever it is is  so bad?  A mental pain that is so bad.  Or a mental dysfunction, whatever it is.  Well, we call it, we call it in psychology, we call it, I mean, in Scientology, we call  it clean an engram.  Engram is pictures of pain, physical or mental.  And we can erase the engram, get all that stuff out of you.  Really? 
[03:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  And how is that done, like, without giving away any trade secrets or anything?  I just want to...  Well, it's a process called auditing.  And an auditor is one who listens.  Like auditorium, auditory nerds and stuff, that's about hearing.  Not auditor like a guy that cooked the books.  Yeah, that's the only auditor I know.  The one that tells me I owe another 20 grand on my taxes.  Look, I had that experience, too.  But anyway, what you do, you listen to these guys and they will find the areas where you 
[03:05:00]  had those engrams created.  And they erase the engrams, get rid of them.  And then some people are paralyzed, but they get up and walk.  Get out of here.  I'm just telling you.  There's some wonderful things about that, man.  And it doesn't hurt you.  And we have things called giving people assists.  Assist is when you experience some pain or injury and stuff.  Give them an assist.  A nerve assist.  They handle all that. 
[03:05:30]  It handles all of that.  And I'm going to tell you what.  Remember when 9-11 happened and all those rescue workers were down there at Ground Zero,  you know, firing all the people.  They were inhaling all that dust and all that junk.  Yeah.  Those firemen were disabled.  And we have a process.  Tom Cruise set up a lot of those things that you can have, getting that have sweat outs.  And you're getting in the sauna and sweat all that junk out of you.  And those guys were sweating in their towels. 
[03:06:00]  They were sweating.  Those towels were purple.  They were getting all them purities out of those guys.  And those guys went back to work.  Had Tom not done that, they would have been disabled on disability right now.  And those firemen sing praises to what happened for them.  So why isn't this more, like, why can't people say, look at what we've done.  Here's proof that it's been done.  Because it seems like this should be all over the world.  Well, we do.  Helping.  We do.  But people choose to follow that bullshit. 
[03:06:30]  And it's been there.  We're doing it now.  But people choose to look for the bad shit, those disgruntled folks that didn't have their ethics in.  And they turn sour.  And they start spreading all kind of bullshit about that.  And that's the bad thing to do.  Maybe other religions.  I'm just playing devil's advocate.  Maybe other religions that don't like the fact that it's picking up a lot of members and press.  And it's impractical to their beliefs.  Maybe they're throwing out some bad press about it. 
[03:07:00]  Well, maybe they are.  I'm not just saying that because I'm in L.A.  Maybe they're sour guys.  Maybe they are.  But we don't discriminate against any religion.  Because everybody wants to better themselves and cleanse themselves and have a better life.  And everybody wants to survive.  So you can be whatever you want to be, but just use the technology of Scientology.  You can be a Christian, a Baptist.  You can be a Buddhist.  You can be a Muslim, whatever.  We do not discriminate. 
[03:07:30]  But what it does, it makes you a better whatever you are.  If you're a Muslim, it makes you a better Muslim.  What's the one religion you think is crazy?  I don't know.  Because a lot of people would say Scientology.  So I'm wondering what a Scientologist would say to that.  We don't.  There's got to be one where you go, oh, man.  No.  Come on.  We don't do that.  The Nike guys.  The Nike guys.  The Nike guys.  We can all agree.  The Nike guys.  That thought the spaceship was behind the comet.  Yeah, yeah.  But they had to cut their genitals off.  Cut their genitals off and kill themselves in the bed.  Marshall White Apple, right? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, the Reverend Jim Jones.  There you go.  You got a cult down there with the Kool-Aid.  That's kind of kooky.  Well.  That's cult.  That's the whole cult thing.  Well.  You'll watch him.  I'd say that's unfortunate.  Yeah.  That's what I'd say.  See?  He's very diplomatic.  No, no, no.  I'm just telling the truth about it.  Dan, what's up?  Nothing.  Sorry to regret on the topic, but is Isaac, when he, like, sleeps with these women, do they 
[03:08:30]  all get pregnant?  Or, I mean, is it just eight women?  Oh.  Y'all worry about my, my, my, my, what's it, what's it, uh?  I was wondering if every girl you've slept with has had a kid.  No, no, no, no.  There have been a couple where you went, whew, do you believe in the birth control?  Because I was going to say.  Yeah, I believe it doesn't feel good.  Birth control is, is, is, is, is.  It's for pussies, right?  Put it out.  Put it out.  Would you, would you eat a steak wrapped in plastic?  Of course not.  It wouldn't taste it. 
[03:09:00]  It doesn't taste good.  I might if it fucking, 40 other steaks would show up if I didn't.  But look, but when I, when I, when I was doing all of that, you know, um, I, I didn't, I  didn't know any better.  And I was living it, living that kind of life.  Sure.  And, um.  You're 63.  How old's your fourth wife?  She's 35.  There you go.  Brother kind of riding the cradle in there.  No, but, okay, but it's, it's cool. 
[03:09:30]  Now, you, you live, uh, here in the States?  Yeah, I live in.  You brought her over from Africa?  Yeah.  And how did she, uh.  Did she have to adjust?  What did she think about America?  Yeah, I brought, I brought New York first.  Wow.  And, I mean, she was doing the skyscrapers and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  But, I mean, she adjusted very well.  Yeah.  She did.  And she's cool.  She found your credit card.  She's doing well, right?  No.  Let me tell you about that.  Uh-oh.  Probably just the opposite.  That's what I found great about her because she didn't get hung up in that material stuff.  Right.  And to tell you the whole thing, when, when, when her brother found that I was in Ghana, 
[03:10:00]  he said, you out of him?  Do you know who that is?  She said, I don't know.  I don't care.  Uh, we ran in the house and got a, got a, got a, got an LP.  Is this the guy you, she said, yeah.  That's how, so?  But it, all that stuff did not, did not faze her.  No.  And that's what, that's what got me because I remember when Eddie Murphy, I won his, won  his, won his, uh, album, she said.  Oh, the Goonie Googoo.  I'm going to find me somebody who don't know how to spell alimony. 
[03:10:30]  Go to Africa and find me.  Some zebra bitch.  Zebra riding Goonie Googoo bitch.  But, but, you know, he said it in, in, in joke, in jest, but the thing is that, uh, my  wife is, she's not caught up in material stuff.  That's cool.  And, you know, she was, she was studying two years before I met her, she was studying  to become a nun.  Really?  That was clean.  Wow.  You cleaned her off.  Man, that must be some junk you're sporting there to get a girl out of the nunnery. 
[03:11:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, she left before she met me.  Oh, yeah?  I wouldn't do that.  Wasn't like, oh, I found a new God.  Look at what's that?  Isaac Hayes is sporting.  That's quite a cock that makes you walk away from eternity.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  Hey, Jimmy.  What do you got here now?  Wow.  Is this a recent picture of you?  No, I did that in 76. 
[03:11:30]  Hey, look, I can take my shirt off now.  Well, you don't.  I'm not too bad.  But you look like I can't tell.  Yeah, that's why I have to ask.  Uh-huh.  You look exactly the same.  You're not aged.  That shot was done in 76 after Deion Walk, and I did a close-out concert up in, what was  that up in, outside of San Francisco.  Damn.  Deion and around.  And we went, we had to go in San Francisco for this photo shoot.  We were tired, man.  And that was done at about 4 o'clock in the morning by Norman Seath, the great photographer. 
[03:12:00]  He did, he did those shots.  And, uh, it's still, I'm still holding up.  Damn, hell yeah, man.  And look at those glasses, those monograms on the glass.  You can tell it's dated.  And look at the watch that I had on.  Oh, wow.  Look at that watch.  Damn.  I was afraid, one of the earlier digital watches.  Wow.  First digital watch.  Yeah.  It's like a calculator watch.  Like a pull saw, whatever.  You remember those pull saws with the red digits? 
[03:12:30]  Well, they really thought those digital watches were going to take over.  Right, right.  Like any future movie you watch from the past, they all got the digital watches.  It lasted for a while, and then everyone went, you know something?  Ah, they died.  Going back to the classic style.  That's it.  And I have a photo with you.  I don't think you, the Trump roast.  As you were walking up the stage, I kind of just stopped you.  Oh, that was you?  Yes.  I've been looking for you, man.  Because I signed it.  It's at home.  But I didn't know where to get it to you.  Oh, wow.  Wait, what's this?  Look at that. 
[03:13:00]  What's funny?  Okay.  You were the one.  Yeah.  I did it right before I left home the other day.  I said, I've got to find this guy.  Oh, it's hilarious.  I was on the set.  God.  I'm taping a show on the set where Isaac was doing a Super Bowl commercial next door.  And so, of course, I wanted to get my photo with him signed, so I ran out and blew it up.  And they put it on the bus, and I never heard back.  So they're like, ah, the bus driver must have made a mistake or whatever.  It's an envelope, man.  Okay.  I signed it.  I signed it in that silver ink on the Sharpie. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  I signed it.  Okay.  Give me your address before I leave it.  I'll just have you sign this one.  Okay.  I had to do it today.  Well, I'll send it to you.  You have two signs.  I'd like that.  Give me the address.  Send it back to you.  He doesn't want to keep looking at your fucking picture, Jimmy.  No, no.  You just signed this one.  No, I'll give you the...  I have an idea.  I'll sign this one, and you can hang this one up in your place, and I'll hang yours up  in my place.  Got to keep the burglars out, one.  Okay.  That's what Isaac wants to do, man.  That's you. 
[03:14:00]  What's up?  Seth, you are one of the best cartoon characters ever, I think.  Well, thank you, Tucker.  Yeah, how'd that fall into your lap, man?  Because that was the...  What happened?  Whatever.  I kept ragging my agent about, give me some voiceovers.  Give me some voiceovers, man.  So one day, he's a British guy.  Mr. Hayes, I think I have a voiceover for you.  Yeah, Disney.  That is a perfect English accent, by the way. 
[03:14:30]  I lived in London for a year.  Anyway, he said, I said, yeah, Disney.  He said, no, not quite.  What do you mean that?  Well, this is a bit different.  Well, different what?  I was already turned off.  He said, well, it's different.  It's called something about, called like South Park.  What is South Park?  He said, look, the guys are coming in.  I was here in New York.  The guys are coming in town tomorrow, and they want to meet you.  Over at the Sony studio over there, and, you know. 
[03:15:00]  Anyway, I said, I ain't going to see him.  No, Ghost, he talked me to go and see him.  So I showed up.  Had an attitude.  Matt and Trey.  Yeah, man, what's up?  I said, hey, man, you're a perfect good part, man.  It's good to meet you, man.  You're perfect for this part.  What part, man?  Well, you're the voice of a chef in a town called South Park, Colorado.  And you're an elementary cook at this school.  And you're going to cook for the kids. 
[03:15:30]  You're going to mentor these little foul-mouthed kids.  I said, man, I'm out of here.  No, no, no, no, no.  Read this.  Read this.  He gave me a piece of the script, and I started cracking up.  I said, who put you guys up there?  Is somebody playing a joke on me?  It can possibly be a real show, right?  Really?  Yeah.  I said, no, no.  He said, no, no, no.  Everything is fine.  You guys are serious about this?  Well, yes, yes.  Well, one thing, you guys got insurance because y'all get sued like hell.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no.  Everything is covered.  Everything is fine. 
[03:16:00]  I said, damn.  You guys are serious about this.  Y'all are some crazy white boys there.  Yeah.  So they said, no, no, no.  So I started thinking, wait a minute.  This thing will last about six weeks.  And I'll pick up this easy money, and I'll be gone.  Six weeks.  So anyway, we started putting episodes in the can, and I started having fun with it.  I was lulled into it.  And when we did Chocolate Salty Balls, I said, man, y'all sure you don't want to do this shit,  man? 
[03:16:30]  I looked out in the studio.  You know, the staff was just cracking up, the engineers and stuff.  I said, well, they dig it.  I went on and did that.  And then we got so many in the can, when the ad date was announced, I said, oh, shit,  I'm getting intrepidations.  Oh, shit, I got to sneak out of town like a flasher.  We're going to send my friends.  But when the thing aired, the ratings went through the roof.  Mm-hmm.  And every subsequent episode after that kept getting high.  And I went to autograph signing out at a video store up in Connecticut. 
[03:17:00]  The limousine pulled up lines around the block.  I said, hey, man, what are these people here for?  You, Mr. Hayes.  What?  I went inside.  People had Hot Butter Soul albums.  They had Shaft albums, Be Continued albums, all that kind of stuff.  And then the younger people, they had little kids with their Shaft dolls.  They said, hey, will you sign this T-shirt?  Will you sign Robin's little shirt right here?  Blah, blah, blah.  I said, damn.  That's when I realized that South Park had spread my fan base from 6 to 96. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  It took off, man.  Yeah.  And this is our 10th season.  It's amazing.  Would you believe it, man?  Yeah.  It's awesome.  Unbelievable.  Were you friends with Richard Pryor?  Oh, yeah.  You know?  Yeah, I knew Richard.  Richard was a very wonderful, generous guy, man.  I'm going to tell you because one time when I was living in Atlanta, I had some financial  problems.  And Richard, we had the same limousine driver.  And Richard gave me $10,000. 
[03:18:00]  I knew who it was.  It was an anonymous donor.  And it took me a year.  Limousine driver, he said, Mr. Hayes, you got money you got about a year ago?  That was Richard Pryor.  He didn't want you to know that.  Richard was like that.  Just gave you $10,000?  Yeah.  He was cool.  Damn.  He was cool.  Wow.  He did a lot of things like that.  But he just didn't want to make a big fuss of it.  Now, getting back to South Park, on this album, we got three discs on it. 
[03:18:30]  Two of CDs.  And the third disc is a DVD.  It's got scenes from, footage from Watch Stacks.  That big thing that we did, Stacks did in L.A.  Yeah.  And so I'm doing Shaft, rolling down the mountainside in Soulsville.  Wow.  And Chef is doing chocolate salt balls on it. 
[03:19:00]  On the DVD?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Oh, yeah.  And we also have a lot of tunes on there that were not, you know, released.  I'm singing that.  I'm doing a gospel tune, Operation Push.  I'm singing His Eyes on the Sparrow.  It's my granddad's favorite song.  I'm doing that.  From Beretta.  Break that down to me. 
[03:19:30]  Break that down.  I got, you got a blanket look on your face, too.  He knows, Anthony knows a little bit about everything, so.  That was the theme song to Beretta.  Oh.  Keep your eye.  That's Sammy Davis.  On the Sparrow.  But that's an old gospel song.  Yeah.  That's the latest thing on Beretta.  Wait, that was, he did it originally?  No, Sammy Davis, Jr.  No, Sammy did that.  But you did a version of that, too.  This is not, this is not Sammy's song.  Now I'm confused.  This is an old gospel tune.  That's an old gospel tune.  You know, why should I feel discouraged? 
[03:20:00]  You know, like that.  And me and Dion, we did a tour together called A Man and a Woman.  And we did a live album at the Fox Theater in Atlanta.  And one of the tunes we did was a unique rendition.  We're doing it at the same time.  I don't know who the hell arranged that, but it was an awesome arrangement.  She did, she did, what's it?  I said a little prayer for you, and I did it by the time I get to Phoenix.  And we sing it together.  And they worked together? 
[03:20:30]  It works together, man.  Who the hell thought that would work?  I don't know, but it worked.  And the artist loves it.  And that's on one of the CDs.  And a lot of my stuff, I did a tune, an instrumental called The Men,  because I scored a trilogy, three different things on television.  And it's called The Men.  It's awesome.  I mean, it's all kind of goodies on there, man. 
[03:21:00]  Isaac's keeping busy, man.  Yep.  And you gave up on morning radio?  You were doing morning radio here in New York.  Yeah, New York at KISS FM.  Yeah.  But, you know, after 9-11, my kids kept saying,  come on back home, come on down, come on back down here, blah, blah, blah.  So they kept me a week longer.  No, let me see.  They kept me a month longer trying to get me to sign up again.  I said, no, I'm going back home.  You were done with it, huh?  Yeah, because I got a radio show in Memphis, 103.5, and it's just an evening show. 
[03:21:30]  See, morning radio kicked my butt.  I did it for five years, and that kicked my butt.  I loved it.  I really loved it.  We had a great team.  But it's time to go back home.  It's time to go back to Memphis.  Isaac Hayes, thank you so much.  Thank you.  Hey, fellas, it's been great hanging with you guys, man.

[03:23:00]  Baseball has been our family's life.  We grew up in the game from the very start.  I had the unique opportunity to watch my father work in the game as a child.  No matter how he felt, he was instantly energized when he put on his work clothes.  Dad always called his uniform his work clothes.  When Billy and I came to the big leagues, Dad was our manager.  We were the double play combination in Baltimore.  Being reunited with Dad in the majors filled the gaps when he was gone so much during my childhood.  Very few people get to know their fathers as Billy and I got to know ours as grown men. 
[03:23:30]  I still remember seeing my dad in the skybox on the night I broke the streak on September 6, 1995.  He was a man of few words in some ways, but in that brief moment we made eye contact, it was like a thousand words were exchanged.  There were many powerful moments during my time in the game, but that was the best human experience I had during my career.  Ripken Baseball, Saturdays at 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. East.  Wee!

[03:25:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I know.  I'm trying hard.  I like, you know, I like the figure skating.  It's a new direction for me.  It's dice on ice.  I was a little disappointed with my performance.  I pulled off the quad and then I go into the triple saw cow.  I can only pull off a double, but I hit the toe loop. 
[03:25:30]  I hit it.  So I'm scared.  Hey guys, what do you think of my...  I went with the gold lame.  I see that dice.  I was going to go with the silver, but it was a little tacky.  We're watching your performance right now.  It looks good.  You're skating backwards right here.  I'm very proud of this move.  See, it comes up.  I do the spin thing.  And now look, I jumped over there, but look where I land.  I'm over here now.  I jump over there.  I land over here now.  But there I am now. 
[03:26:00]  I'm twirling.  I'm very dainty on the ice.  Most people say I'm a big guy.  I'm dainty on the ice.  It brings out my feminine side.  Look at you reaching for the sun right here.  Now I'm reaching, reaching.  And here I go.  Now I go down into the low leg grab spin.  And look at my hair.  My hair's flying like when...  I call this the dice camel.  It was the hammer camel, but now it's mine.  Look at you flying around the ice now. 
[03:26:30]  Now look, I got some speed up.  I go all the way from over there to over here now.  Now I'm in front of the judges.  There's one quad, a triple, and a triple.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I pulled that off.  Oh!  Bop!  So I'm skating, right?  Yeah.  And this fag wants to put his tongue up my...  Oh!  Now I'm going...  Look at me backwards.  Look, I'm skating backwards. 
[03:27:00]  Look at my hair.  And the costume's good.  I wear a lame leather jacket with dice bedazzled on the back.  Oh!  Well, it's a little weird with the sweatpants, though, Dice.  Yeah, well, the sweatpants help.  It helps with the atrodynamics.  Oh, you're slowing it down, El.  Now I slow it down.  Here's where I get dramatic.  Okay, very...  Here I...  Now I'm going for another jump.  I hit that one.  Oh!  The quad!  And now a toe loop. 
[03:27:30]  And now I grab my foot and spin on the ice.  Look at this.  Look at my hair.  I'm handsome out there.  What?  Do they score for handsome?  Oh, they should.  Now I do something no one else does.  What's that?  I bring midgets out on the ice with me.  Watch me jump the midget.  Oh!  Look at that.  Now I look.  I put my leg on top of the midget, and he's skating like he's my leg.  I bend it to the... 
[03:28:00]  Oh, here we go.  Now I go into an Italian thing.  It's the tarantula song.  Look, look.  I'm skipping on the ice.  You can barely tell I'm wearing skates.  You're running on your toes, I see.  Eeeh!  Eeeh!  Yeah, the other skaters in the back, they go,  Oh, dice.  Why do you have to be so good at skating?  I go, take the C out of your A.  Faggot!  Oh! 
[03:28:30]  Now I'm passing by the judges.  A toe loop.  A spin.  Give me a perfect score.  Eeeh!  Bump the gold medal's mine.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, bravo.  Nice finish.  Thank you.  See how I threw my hands up in the air?  Very nice.  That's dainty.  Now wait, I gotta wait for my scores.  You went down on one knee there.  Very nice.  All right.  Look, instead of the stuffed animal, what am I holding?  A midget.  It's in my lap. 
[03:29:00]  A midget.  I wait for my scores.  Uh-huh.  6-0, 6-0.  Dice wins.  No controversy there.  The French judge screws me.  I'm gonna plow.  Hey, French judge, suck my banana juice.  It's Dice on Ice.  I like the Dice on Ice.  Very good.  Oh!  I'm having trouble with the quad. 
[03:29:30]  Hey, Club Soda Kenny, collect my roses, okay?  The people love me.  Out on the ice.  It's beautiful.  Oh!  I skate unbelievable.  Look at my ass in this outfit.  It's gorgeous.  I like the tight ass on it.  I leave the legs loose so I can do my jumps. 
[03:30:00]  And the choreography's gorgeous.  I learned that at Pips when I used to play there in Brooklyn.  Uh, Dice, someone wants to know if you're gonna consider, um, pair skating.  Well, with like a chick?  Yeah, or maybe a little of that, uh, ice dance.  What, do I lay it down and put my yam bag in her face?  Oh!  Score me!  I win!  Bop!  And now the finishing move.  Mule juice on the face.  Pinch the helmet.  Pinch the helmet.  Soak I win!  Oh! 
[03:30:30]  Get me another broad.  This one's full of goo.  She can't skate with goo in her eyes.  I banana juiced her eyes shut.  She's skating into the walls.  She looks like a retard.  Oh!
