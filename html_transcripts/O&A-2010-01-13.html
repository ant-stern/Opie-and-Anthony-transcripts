<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with vehement condemnation of MTV's "Little Miss Perfect,"  using derogatory terms to describe the show's depiction of young girls in provocative clothing.  The hosts mimicked the contestants' behavior and also complained about Cablevision's service.  The conversation then shifted to the Conan O'Brien/Jay Leno Tonight Show feud, with the hosts playing and dissecting monologues from both comedians, speculating about Conan's future career, predicting a move to Fox.

A substantial portion of the show focused on Anthony's past relationship with traffic reporter Jill Nicolini, specifically a bizarre incident involving a naked woman found in Anthony's closet.  Audio of Jill discussing the incident on her newscast was played, sparking a lengthy discussion about whether Anthony should apologize, exploring various apology methods and speculating on Jill's motivations.  Callers offered their opinions and advice.  The hosts detailed the fortified security measures around Anthony's closet, now resembling a "panic room."  A brief phone interview with Lydia, a friend of Anthony's, provided a somewhat psychological perspective on the situation.  This segment included detailed, often crude, descriptions and jokes about the incident and its fallout.

The discussion transitioned to Anthony's attempts to apologize to Jill. Brainstorming apology strategies, from humorous tweets to heartfelt letters, involved listener input.  The hosts briefly considered involving Mick Foley or Steven Singer in the apology, but ultimately didn't.  Tangents included a disturbing animal abuse video, further discussion of the "closet" incident and its repercussions, an analysis of Anthony and Jill's relationship dynamics, and Anthony's eventual on-air apology to Jill.

Jim Norton joined the broadcast, discussing his recent appearance on Jay Leno's show, touching upon topics like steroids, *Jersey Shore*, and sharing an anecdote about a fanatical pilot.  The conversation broadened to Mark McGwire's steroid use, Jose Canseco's role in exposing it, Snooki's teacher punching her,  the acceptability of hitting women, true crime stories (insurance fraud, people being pushed off things), recent NYU student deaths, and Cosmo Radio's mocking comments about Opie and his security guard, Kenny, which included a played audio clip.  The segment concluded with a humorous and protracted discussion about the difficulties of installing a coat hook in their studio.

The next segment focused on Cosmo Radio host Taylor and her show, "Wake Up with Taylor."  The hosts examined online pictures of Taylor, commenting on her appearance and voice, discussing the possibility of having her on the show, and planning to send Kenny as a sort of bodyguard/ambassador.  Speculation about Kenny's role,  joking he was listening to a transistor radio, followed.  The conversation then moved to *American Idol*, with in-studio guests Sam and Danny offering opinions and clips.  A caller recounted a humorous anecdote about a heavily armed guard in Haiti, leading to a brief discussion of the recent earthquake there.  A phone interview with Taylor and her co-host, a former police officer, ensued, featuring playful banter and covering Taylor's street harassment experience.  The conversation further covered *American Idol*, *Avatar*, and the reported phenomenon of "post-Avatar depression."  The hosts also briefly referenced a previous segment featuring "Chip Chipperson."

The final segment began with a discussion of *Avatar* online forums and the intense sadness expressed by users, often ironically ending with "LOL."  The hosts then discussed gamers' immersion in role-playing games. Opie shared a personal anecdote about Monopoly.  The conversation turned to late-night television, focusing on Jimmy Kimmel's impersonations of Leno and O'Brien, Chevy Chase's performance on *Community*, and Magic Johnson's failed talk show.  A caller, Brian, shared his depression after watching *Leaving Las Vegas* and discussed his relationship with alcohol.  This led to a lengthy, crudely humorous segment featuring a sound clip and discussion of a fictional Rosie O'Donnell bus-riding movie, rife with offensive racial and disability stereotypes. A bus driver was interviewed. Andy Levy from *Red Eye* joined, and the discussion returned to the Leno/O'Brien controversy, with Levy, Opie, and Anthony offering perspectives and playing audio clips of Conan criticizing NBC.  The segment concluded with more phone calls from purported "NBC moles," vulgar speculation about Jay Leno's penis size, a caller's audio problems, and a reference to the show's recurring apples-and-buttocks bit.

[00:10:00]  Ha ha ha  Huck you  For this  Later time slot  I think a lot of people  Read the  Conan O'Brien  Statement yesterday  And it basically says  Fuck you NBC  You don't have to read it  No  It's long  Yeah  And he talks about  It could have been  A Bob Costas moment  How he had a dream  I had a dream  Of one day  Of hosting the tonight show  And that dream came true  And blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  And the dream came true  Right off main street  Ha ha ha 
[00:10:30]  Um  Yeah but he basically said  Yeah I'm not doing that  1205 shit  No  He said the tonight show  Is at 1130  Uh huh  As you put it on later  It's not the tonight show  And he's not gonna do it  And uh  That's that  But uh  Conan's saying that  Cause there's got  Obviously a clause  In his contract  That he doesn't have to do  You know the show  Any later than  1135  Oh  And at that point  You know  He gets to negotiate  And out  With NBC  Yeah they're gonna  Pay him or something  And and they don't

What do I mean? 
[00:12:30]  Chaos  And craziness  And mayhem  Wow  Wow  A couple of minutes ago  Conan O'Brien  Who was the host  Of the Tonight Show  Yeah  Over there at NBC  Announced that he would not  Follow  Jay Leno  At 12.05  Yeah  So you know what this means  That's right  I knocked off another competitor  Thank you  Conan said he made the decision 
[00:13:00]  Not to follow Leno  At 12.05  After he talked to Johnny Carson  That's what I thought  I would want  But listen to this  If Conan does leave  The Tonight Show  President Obama  Then has to appoint  A replacement  Did you know that?  Oh my god  And then I got a call  Just before I came out here  From NBC  And they said  Look  Look  We still don't want you back  I can't  Really  What  I said 
[00:13:30]  And now  So Jay Leno  Apparently is moving back  To 11.30  And it's been hard  On my mom  It's been tough  On my mom  Really  Because for the last  Six months  She's been forced  To watch me  Ah  Important  And now  According to the New York Times  Al Qaeda  Is claiming responsibility  For the wreckage 
[00:14:00]  At NBC  Crazy  And everyone is watching  The late night shows  Right now  I know  Yeah this is great  For all of them  Absolutely  Apparently  But you know  How many are going to be there  To reap the rewards  Of the ratings  Yeah  I guess Jimmy Kimmel  Did his monologue  In Jay Leno  Makeup last night  Or something  So he's getting involved  Everyone is just  Getting involved  With this  Christ  Want to hear what  Leno had to say  It's short  Sure  This was from last night 
[00:14:30]  Leno  Talking about the situation  The guy that  Wins in the end  On this one  Huh  Yeah  I'm sure you know  NBC announcement  Pulling a plug  On our show  February 12th  February 12th  Here's the amazing  Listen to this  Here's the amazing  That is the exact date  The Mayan calendar  Predicted we would go  On to  Really  Wow  I gotta tell you  You know  The folks here at NBC  They don't handle  These things well  They don't have  A lot of tact  Like after  They canceled the show 
[00:15:00]  They told me  If I put on 10 pounds  I can get on  Biggest Loser  You know  That didn't seem right  And you gave  You didn't do that  Well I'm thinking about  Jesus  They don't know  What the fuck  They're doing  It's amazing  NBC  The executives  Yeah  Well we've been in that  Situation  How have we  Yeah  They come up with  Their brilliant ideas  And then they fail  Miserably  And then they don't  Fire themselves  They fire everybody  Around them  No no  No management heads  Roll  Ever  They just 
[00:15:30]  Yeah get rid of this one  Get rid of that  Put this one in this  Time slot  And then hope for the best  Yeah  I mean someone  It was someone's idea  To do this  It was someone's idea  To take the number one  Late night show  Take the host  And move him  Right  And put someone else  In there  Right  And didn't work  And why does that guy  Still have a job  Yeah  And they only gave him  Seven months  Yeah  They only gave Conan O'Brien  Seven months  I mean you know  There's not much of a buzz  On his version of the 
[00:16:00]  Tonight show  But the fact remains  He only had seven months  But I guess in media  These days  You have to get the job  Done immediately  Or they start panicking  Behind the scenes  Yeah  So let's get to Conan  Conan  Conan's gaining a lot of fans  For this thing  Yeah  He's gaining a lot of sympathy  Through this whole  He's the underdog  Of the whole thing  At this point yeah  I think a lot of people  Are on Team Conan  And this is what he had to say  Last night  Please I may not have  That much time 
[00:16:30]  Please  You're using valuable time here  Yeah  And he's gone  Where'd he go  I don't know  They took him away  Yes  They took him away  Thank you for that  Hello there  My name is Conan O'Brien  And I may soon be available  For children's parties  So  I made a peacock  Yeah 
[00:17:00]  No no seriously  Welcome to NBC  Where our new slogan is  No longer just  Screwing up prime time  No it's a crazy day  Crazy day  I've been giving this whole situation  It really has been crazy here Andy  It's been  It's been the most fun  I've ever had in a showbiz scandal  Wow  Yeah  It's fun  And I've been giving this situation  A lot of thought  You know  This is a true story  When I was a little boy  I remember watching 
[00:17:30]  The Tonight Show  With Johnny Carson  And thinking  Someday  I'm going to host that show  For seven months  I knew that was the perfect amount of time  What was going on  NBC says that they are planning to have  The late night situation  Worked out  Before the winter Olympics start  That's what they said  Yeah  And trust me  When NBC says something  You can take that to the bank 
[00:18:00]  Yeah  They just  They're good people  They're very good people  A lot going on  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  Is in the news  He's still under fire  For remarks he made  About President Obama's  Blackness  You reading about that?  Yeah  Bad  Yeah  Sources say Reid  Could face congressional censure  Or even worse  Be promised  The Tonight Show  At 1130  That's not good  Bye 
[00:18:30]  I wouldn't wish that on anyone  There is  Here's the difference I hear today  Oh damn  Some good lines right there  We've been playing the monologues  Off and off  Since this whole thing broke  Right?  Yeah  There's a different energy  With Conan  Oh yeah  He knows something  That nobody else knows yet  And that isn't that  He knows that  Good natured network  Ribbing that  No no  You recall Letterman doing 
[00:19:00]  In the past  That is  He's taking some good shots  I am pissed at you  Right  That's Opie talking about  Serious management  What?  Type of jabs  What?  Pleasantries my friend  Pleasantries  No he had no pleasantries there  No no  He's like good people  Good people  You hear the energy  It's different  Yeah  He knows he's going to be okay  And I don't think  From a money standpoint  I think he knows that  He will have a show  In the very near future  With a company that will 
[00:19:30]  Embrace him  Oh yeah  And want him  And give him a chance  To succeed  That's it  You can hear all that  In that  Because the monologue  A day  I think it was  The day before  His energy was like  Oh man  What the fuck  Yeah  Getting fucked over  Mother  You know what it is too  I think  For the most part  This usually doesn't happen  The public knows  That the real bad guy in this  Are the executives at NBC  Like they don't usually get that 
[00:20:00]  And they pick one guy  And go  Oh I guess Leno's an asshole  Or you know  Conan what a dick  He's not doing this  That  I think most people do understand  That the network itself  The executives  Fucked up royal  Oh yeah  So you know  All the guys  Have a little bit of sympathy  And the viewers are tuning in  And it's like a whole other thing  Yeah Conan will be just fine  Yeah the executives  The nameless faceless people  You don't even know who they are  Yeah  Everybody's talking about them 
[00:20:30]  But you don't know who they are  They know who they are  Oh they do  Oh fuck  Conan's really giving it to me today  I bet there are some great  Closed door meetings  That just are  Oh  People getting yelled at  Mmhmm  Oh  Temper tantrums  Phones being thrown at walls  Sure  Gold records being  Taken off the walls  Linger Longer  Smashed over a secretary's head  Yes exactly  John G from Lexington writes  Jingle Heimer Schmidt  His name is 
[00:21:00]  He writes just not  Oh  It was Leno's contract  He was signed  And Conan  Was going to be owed  50 million dollars  If he didn't get  The Tonight Show  So they were in a huge bind  Mmhmm  Yeah I think this comes down  To all sorts of contracts  Well someone wrote  The fucking contract  I think the executives  Got very greedy  Yeah  Is what happened  You know they signed  Conan and then what  They tell him  If we don't give you  The Tonight Show 
[00:21:30]  By a certain date  Then there's a payout  Or something  Yeah  And then they just  Expected I guess  Leno to fade away  At that point  But Leno's ratings  Were still hot  And he was number one  Yeah  So now they're like  Oh fuck  Now what do we do  Well that's a fuck up  Yeah  Then that's a fuck up  It's still fuck ups  In the end  Ugh  Please  So we got that going on  Which is nice  Yeah  I uh  I got a nice little  Mention yesterday  You and Jill

[00:22:30]  Yeah raw nerve  On the bio channel  So we were talking  About the relationship  And you know  The girl hidden  In the closet  And that whole  Spiel  But apparently  She had talked  About this  At like  A quarter after  Six  In the morning  Out of nowhere  Before you talked  About it with Shatner  Yeah  Out of nowhere  Yeah there's an  Interest there  And I don't know  What it is  But we have  The audio  Of her  The traffic girl  Here in New York

[00:31:30]  What does that mean  That it looks a little better  It doesn't mean anything  There's you know something  It doesn't mean a thing  Is there unfinished business there  There's nothing unfinished  I'm just  Then why  As we're doing our first break  Every morning  You'll go  Oh I go like  I'm just looking at the  I'm just looking at  You know  It's very rare  You get to see  An ex  On a daily basis  Like that  On television  So I just take a look  And go like  You know  It's looking good 
[00:32:00]  Or  It doesn't look too good  But why would you care  There's no caring  It's just an opinion  Which one is that  Wait go back  Was that one  What  Down at the bottom  No  No  Okay  I can't even tell  What am I doing  This is true  Let's go to Dan in Knoxville  What  I think Dan's right  Way more right than I  Dan go ahead  Hey good morning  Good morning Dan  Hey there's some  Relationships that are 
[00:32:30]  Just over  I mean  The way you did her  Man  She's a proud woman  She was a short chick  And you just  Drug her through the  You know  Where everybody  Can see you  Just do her over  And you saw  You saw how  Bingeful she was  If she came back  To after  Breakup sex  Dude she would be  Thinking  How can I get him  One more time  Yeah it's over  Yeah  That brings up  A good point  I think Dan does  Bring up a good point  Because I think  I'm setting up  Horribly 
[00:33:00]  I'm thinking  A nice little  Breakup sex session  And no she's  Thinking revenge  Really  Yeah  This long after  This leaves you  Tied up in your house  Or something  With a dildo  In your ass  Just something  Where's the revenge  She's too proud man  You raked her over  The coals  In front of like  America man  She still owes you  Probably  No  Dan  It kills me to say this  But I was wrong  You are 
[00:33:30]  Correct  I don't  I think it's  I think it's more  About revenge  Than  Than the breakup  Sex thing  Absolutely  Yeah  Yeah  She would never  Let anybody know  That she came  Back to you  For some kind  Of like  Breakup sex  Like she's that  Hard up  No way  She would do that  Yeah  People say  She wants to  Make me grovel  She's going to  Cut my bar in half  With a chainsaw  Maybe she's setting  You up  By mentioning  Her home  Maybe she's setting  You up by  Mentioning the  Closet incident  Maybe  Maybe get your 
[00:34:00]  Attention  And all of a sudden  You do do this  Little text thing  And then she's got you  Chloroform  She wants to make it look like  You know  She stamped it up  Like if she did come back  For like  But she would like  End up like  I played him along  All the time  I never was going to  Have sex with him  But he was ready to  Yeah but that isn't  A thing  I'm not  See that's the thing  This isn't a  Relationship  Looking for relationship  Thing  I'm saying  So there's no way  To scorn me

[00:37:00]  That would be a perfect PS  Yeah oh PS  Can I  No booyah  Don't put PS  Booyah later  Jimmy there's been a thing going on  Like Ant's kind of looking at the TV  A lot  Look Jill's on  And he'll go  I'll look and just go like  So  So yesterday  William Shatner got into  The whole Jill Nicolini thing  And why it went down  And what does it mean to Anthony  And blah blah blah  It was pretty good  It was an example of how he  Interviews people  Does an interview  To get like you know 
[00:37:30]  People to open up and talk  Get stuff out of you  So you know  We talked about the Gene Simmons thing  And then that  And you know  We were just talking  But I didn't know  That before that  Jill had mentioned something  At about quarter after six  On her newscast  About finding a girl in a closet  And you know  Oh yeah  I had that happen  And she goes  Oh you remember  That guy cheated on me  There was a girl in the closet  Like she went through the whole thing 
[00:38:00]  Wow  I was like oof  Yeah so there's  What's going on there  I think you gotta just call her  And ask her  Let her yell at you  If she has to  Yeah  What's up  Why are you mentioning the closet still  And why am I taking a peek at the TV  And thinking that you're looking pretty good these days  Let's just get into this  Just you two  Do you know how difficult it is  To get into that closet now  Oh really  Do you know how difficult it is  To get into that closet  Dude I am not kidding you  Magnetic locks  What the fuck does that represent 
[00:38:30]  Steel door  And a separate alarm system  Can we get Lydia on the phone today  I know you hate her  But I need to know what that means  The closet that the naked girl was in  Yeah yeah  That Jill found  Yeah  Is now a closet that you  Almost can't get into yourself  Well that is  Without a lot of effort  That is pretty much the armory  And there's no one else  That could get in there  No  No  It's pretty much  Your closet  And like I said  Completely separate 
[00:39:00]  From any other alarm thing  It's like you know  It's like in a movie  When the glass case is over  The precious item  And you pick it up  And it's alarmed  Dude  You want Lydia today  Don't you  We gotta find out what that means  And that's  In her dumb fucking brain  Instant alarm also  So it's not one of those  Beep beep beep  Where you have like  A couple of seconds  To punch in the code  That goes immediately  And it's a zone  Where the police  Get called immediately  Wow really 
[00:39:30]  Oh yeah  Fuck  We need Lydia  So drive us  See if only I had that lock  I could have just  Plausible deniability  Could have been going  I forgot the  I forgot the key code  Sure  You could call her  And apologize  Why would I do that  For being shitty  Yeah  Would you do that  Absolutely  Why  Because it would have been  In that situation  It was your fault  Yeah  I mean I've done things  Dude that would break the ice  You know what though  I was angry 
[00:40:00]  At the  Reciprocal  Anger  And result  Thereof  The reciprocal anger  Look I watched it all happen  You certainly did  It was horrible thing  Girl slaps  Guy who did horrible thing  Picks up cannonball  And fires it  In response to slap  Which was justified  Alright  I can't disagree with you  It was like if Hitler 
[00:40:30]  Had explained  Why'd you do what you did  And Jewel stepped on my foot  That's the level of  Inappropriate reaction  So why don't you do that  Just go  You know  I think I owe you an apology  Just write that  In the text  And then we could go  With the PS  I don't know  I think  Go Jill  I think I owe you an apology  I've had a lot of time  To think about this  And I really think  The right thing is  To just apologize  I think before  I should have been more mature  About what was going on  Between you and I 
[00:41:00]  Should I have  No  Of course not  You were just  Fucking living your life  But I think  That  Like the breaking of the ice  And the acknowledging  That she had said something  On the air  Without any  You know  Diving right into  Hey let me  Bring up this  You know  How about PS  I think I owe you an apology  We have the first part  Of the letter  Written nice for you  Or the text message  Am I being like  Really bad  By not apologizing  That's up to you 
[00:41:30]  I wonder if I would  Because I don't  I wasn't living your life  I don't know what was going on  You felt like  You were being strangled  And that was  Your way out of it  Well yeah  See  But  So I don't know  I don't know  If I would apologize  I don't know  I'd have to be  In that situation  I did feel guilty  A little bit  I don't think  I ever apologized  To an ex  The way things went down  You know  I never have  I never had a reason  Now that I think about it  Yeah but that was  A pretty  That was a pretty  Big fuck 
[00:42:00]  Alright look  That was a bad one  Look let's slow down  A little bit  Yeah  Not only did she find  A naked girl  In your closet  It was after a party  That you guys threw  For each other  With big cutouts  And both families there  Don't rub it in  This was the party  Where the families  Were getting together  For the first time  Okay  So you know what  I  Oh my god  I hate to be the faggot here  But I think maybe  Yeah  You might offer an apology 
[00:42:30]  That wasn't bad  It wasn't just a casual  You know  Let's just throw a party together  I remember now  That was bad timing  I remember meeting her relatives  Because I was there for a while too  Yeah yeah yeah  And everyone was excited  There was aunts meeting aunts  And uncles meeting uncles  And there was some  They were bringing like  Homemade dishes  Oh my god  It was despicable  It really was  The worst timing possible  How did I think about it  It was reprehensible  You  You  She's mortified  Oh 
[00:43:00]  Not anymore but  Oh god  Here's how the phone call should go  Hello  Hi  Jill  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Maybe  And then you can move on  Then maybe you move on officially  Yeah  Yeah then you don't take a peek at the TV and all  Maybe there's a little guilt there  Like I really did her wrong  And she didn't do anything really that bad to me  Yeah  You had cutouts  Around the pool area  I know 
[00:43:30]  Giant life size cutouts  She loved you  There's still party favors  In one of the closets  From that party  And every time I open it up  I'd look and I'd go  Wow  I was really kind of a scumbag there  She didn't know that she was  She thought she was falling in love with a comic genius  She didn't realize she was competing against spaghetti on the wall  And a beating for ice cream sandwiches  She didn't understand that  Look there  Someone's getting very close to being banned for calling me a hole 
[00:44:00]  I'm just being honest here  Not being a hole dude  Yeah  I'm just being honest  I mean usually I'd be like  Fuck the broad  Blah blah blah  But you know  Now that I think about it  Walking through that backyard  With the excitement from her family  Seeing your house for the first time  You're fucking  You're killing me  With your mom there  And your aunts  And your uncle  Her news friends were there  Oh no  Showing attention to him on the news  This is my boyfriend Anthony  A pulpy and Anthony  Oh no  Yeah 
[00:44:30]  This was  This was a pre-party that  They were hoping was going to lead to a wedding  I mean  In their minds  This was  This was a relationship that was going all the way  See that's what got me a little like crazy  And she came back to the house  Kind of excited  Like wow that was kind of a nice party we threw for everybody  Oh yeah  And then she discovers the girl in the closet  Yeah yeah  Yeah  Who's a nice girl by the way  Yeah  I'm not  You know  Saying anything bad about her  I'm not  Certainly  It's just the situation was very 
[00:45:00]  You know  I was feeling like  Wow there's  There's some pressure here  But perhaps I should have  Handled it more maturely  And  And talked about  That was an  In the  In the stuffed animal pit  Yeah you don't take pictures  I've seen that  You don't take pictures like that  With a slob  This was  This was different  But it was getting too much for me  There's pictures of you holding a baby  I was rebounding  Very badly at that point 
[00:45:30]  You guys looked good together too  Yeah you did  I was rebounding  Look at the love in your eyes  Look at those  Look at those doe eyes of Anthony  God damn  You haven't taken a picture like that in a while  Look at you  Nah now I'm just  Look at  Look at  Look at  Look at you  You're shining  Now I make that  The only time I make that look  And have that smile on my face  Is when I buy a new gun  That's when I'm happy  At the gun store  I need Lydia  I need Lydia  Oh she's on the phone  She is?  Yeah  Oh okay good  Watch those two fall in love 
[00:46:00]  Lydia  Good morning boys  Alright Lydia  Did you hear about Anthony's closet?  Yes I did of course  So you've been listening for the last 20 minutes or so  So you know the closet that the naked girl was in  That Jill found  Is now a closet that is pretty secure  A panic room  It is uh  Almost  Oh yeah just about a panic room  Yeah  Yeah  Do you  Do you  Uh  Wait hold on  I don't wanna  I have started putting water in there 
[00:46:30]  Oh really?  That would be a good idea  Yes yes I'm starting to supply it with um  With stuff  Maybe some type of um  Food and water  That might be able to last for you know  How would you get out of that closet  If you were locked inside?  I'd fucking blast my way out  Oh  Okay there you go  I  No  I uh  I have  I have a way out  There's you know  Okay  There's obviously a way out  So Lydia  This was the closet that the naked girl was in  And now it's this uh 
[00:47:00]  It's basically I guess a gun closet  I haven't seen it myself  And it's very very secure  With all sorts of alarm  Oh yeah  Systems  Magnetic locks  All kinds of fun stuff  What do you  Talk about locking the bind door  After the horse has gotten out huh?  Well this is true  Maybe you don't want the horse to come back in  No maybe not  I hear that you know  The topic of breakup sex with Jill  Has come up a couple of times  Well what do you think  No no I started  I started that dumb thing  But now I'm starting to think 
[00:47:30]  That's not a good idea  But I mean you understand  The breakup sex thing right?  Oh sure  It's some of the best sex  It's some of the best sex  You'll ever have in your life  It's like angry  There's a lot of anger  In that type of sex  There isn't a sex thing here  That I'm talking about  No I know  We're moving past that  But with your psychobabble  Lydia  What is that whole closet thing about?  Well  You know  Number one  Anthony was put in a very bad position 
[00:48:00]  Unfortunately by himself  As he said  You know  Probably got himself  Really pressured  In the relationship  And I know he has a great deal  Of difficulty  Telling women in particular  You know  What he really wants  And  Sort of got  I don't know  Everything sort of went  Very very quickly  In that whole relationship  But from start to finish  The closet itself  I speak volumes to Anthony  You know  It's his safe room 
[00:48:30]  His gun room  Also the place where  His relationship  Ended  I don't even know  Where to start  With the closet  You have nothing  Thank you  You're so disappointing  What are you  Hung over from your wine?  Jill was a nice girl  She wasn't  She wasn't just some girl  You fucked once  Those are different  She's not just a one night  Fucking  Annoying chick  You fucked once  She was a girl 
[00:49:00]  You dated  Exactly  It's different  We had a great  Fun summer  Yeah  That's what happened  Yeah  Yeah  And  But there's something  Not finished there  If you're taking those peeks  I think that  Wow  That's a great gun closet  Have you guys  Thought about  Giving it another try?  No  No  No  There's no way  This is just  A phone call  Someone is saying  You shouldn't text  You should call  Lydia I'm going to let you go  Thank you  Okay guys 
[00:49:30]  What's what  Rick in Queens  Rick  Hey Rick  Yeah  And  I totally think  You should act like a man  And give her a call  You can't send her a text message  After fucking setting off  That powder keg  What a call?  That's a little personal  For something like this  Is there  How about  No one has asked you  Is there any guilt  How that relationship ended?  Oh I've said  I've said it before  Yeah  You know  It was pretty scummy  So give her a call  It was pretty fucking 
[00:50:00]  Dastardly  How about  You just give her a call  And admit to that  If you want  Why should I  Like  Do you feel like  There is  I mean  A phone call  Is very personal  Look  I don't  I don't  I don't call  My family enough  Honestly  You should do a face to face  I'm not bullshitting you  Oh my god  I'm not saying he's going to  You'll never do a face to face  Oh my god  The relationship end was bad  But look  We've all done that  Before  We've all fucked up  And got caught  It happens  You know  You were scared  I'm not even saying  It was the after 
[00:50:30]  It was the bombing after  Like the attack after  Yeah  That to me was the harsh one  He'll never do a face to face  You're absolutely right  That was bad  You know  Do you feel like  There's unfinished business there?  Uh  Unfinished business  To  As far as the relationship went  Or unfinished business  As far as  Um  You know  I pulled some really severe shenanigans  Let's put it this way  And I should  Kind of you know  Fess up  Over a year later  We're still talking about it  Should I fess up?  Like that  That kind of unfinished business 
[00:51:00]  That's up to you  I'm trying to get into your head  It's hard to get into Anthony Coomia's head  I don't believe there's any  Uh  Relationship  Unfinished business  No okay  I understand that  But do you feel like  There's definitely unfinished business on my part  That probably I should  You know  Uh  Uh  Okay so you don't want to  Maybe apologize  So you don't want to  In some way shape or form  I don't know  I don't know  I didn't even know  That's appropriate  After a year and a half  Or whatever  Listen listen  Okay  I want to simplify this  So you don't want  Another relationship with her  No no  That's done 
[00:51:30]  But you feel like  Okay maybe I should like  Talk to her about some things  That bothers me  When  When I'm alone in my house  Is that self  Is that self-serving  For me  Or is that like  Actually  She might go like  Oh well  At least he manned up  Or  No I think  Or would I be doing it  Just so I felt a little  Bit less  Less  Uh nasty  When I sit there  And go like  Well I  I really did a scummy thing  I'm not  I'm not that bad of a guy 
[00:52:00]  I know I'm not that bad  I was really a bad guy  You know  And I've never been  I really know I'm not bad  Like that  And here it is  And this is the God's honest truth  Right  I have never been a bad guy like that  In my entire life  You know what  With anybody  Hold on  You know what  I'm gonna back you up  On that one  Yeah  You are a good guy  I just have never done anything  So like  That ruthless  So  You know  I've always been pretty decent  So  So it did kind of  You know  Make me feel pretty  Shitty 
[00:52:30]  How about you man up  And give her a phone call  That's in between the text  And the face to face  Jimmy is right  About a face to face  But that could be just brutal  That's brutal for anyone  But I think especially you  I'm a scared  Just write her and go  I would like to just talk to you  About how it went down  I'd be a scared  To go  To call  Really  Like voice  Like sitting here going  Hello  Hi  Alright how about you start with a text  Well that's why  Start with a text 
[00:53:00]  I shouldn't do a text  Hey  I would like to talk to you  And see what she writes back  She might go  Go fuck yourself  Don't worry  She might say  Don't worry about it  You know  Or she might say  That would be nice  Just walk  Just walk over to the WB studios  And crash the set  Yeah that would be comfortable  With a bottle of Jack in your hand  Yeah  Just a fucking  Ah shit  No I  I don't know  I  I just  I don't know 
[00:53:30]  I wouldn't know how to handle anything like that  You know she'd treat you well  What am I going to tell  Write down a few things you want to say  Like not word for word  But a few subjects you want to cover  Like this this and this  Then you call her  And you just kind of go through them real quick  I don't want to make it that complicated  It's not complicated  It's very simple  It's very complicated  You're saying you're sorry for somebody who is nice that you're wrong  I can't do that  Just speak from your freaking cold hearted heart  But you might forget  I don't know how  You just put down like topics  Like I want to  Like what I did after  Bullet points  Exactly  Make believe you're doing a live read 
[00:54:00]  See that I could do  I want to do the Jill McLeany live read  We can practice here  I should do a mixtape  I should send a mixtape  You can express yourself in music  It could run the gamut  You know I'm sure the listeners would come up with  With the songs for you  Go out to the WB studios  And stand there with a boombox over your head  No he doesn't want her back  Let's all get on the same page  We finally got it out of Anthony 
[00:54:30]  He doesn't want her back  He's moved on as far as that goes  But he feels like  Maybe  He  He needs to say something  Because  Because he's not that guy  I don't know  I don't know  Or we could just shut the fuck up  And talk about Leno  And everything  I just don't  I don't know  That was very humiliating for that girl  One second I think it would be  You know appropriate  And then the next I'm like 
[00:55:00]  You know it's been a year and a half  Why  Why  Dig up  You know  Why pick at the old wound  Or something  Apologies  And people like to hear that you're sorry  It does mean something  Especially if you are  You obviously are  You're a nice guy  I'm on the radio  Why can't I just say  I'm sorry  Can someone tell her  There's a few apologies  I'm waiting for  Trust me  Trust me on that  And you know what  It doesn't matter how much time goes by  If you get that apology  It makes everything okay  Would you find a guy in a closet  I think you should 
[00:55:30]  You'll feel better if you do  It's selfish  And it's good for her  It's both  That's up to you  That's our two cents  You're an interesting fellow Jimmy  Jimmy fucking  Jimmy owns up  But Jimmy is like  Ruthless at times  Yeah  Yet when it comes to something like that  He would do the right thing  Because it's really weird  You  And you go after anybody  But it's like she's  She's not a  And you were just in a relation 
[00:56:00]  It's like she's  Not weaker than you  In the sense that she can't stand up for herself  But in that type of a battle  Yeah  Like of her saying mean stuff  And you saying mean stuff  Oh I know  It's a massacre  You want me and Jimmy to go with you  And we could just kind of  Oh that would help  Yeah  I'm not going anywhere  Oh you're thinking about it  No no no  Is this something you want to do  Or should we just shut our fucking mouth  No that's just it  I don't  This is your life  I don't know  I don't know if I would want to do that  Or if too much time has gone by  Where it's like 
[00:56:30]  Ah it's over  Screw it  I mean  Obviously yesterday she brought it up  And seemed to  You know  Get a laugh about it  So maybe  Maybe she's past it  And maybe  Kind of digging it up  Is inappropriate  She's past it  Like you're past it  But how it ended  Is probably still kind of  Probably bothers her a little bit  You caught her off guard man  Oh my god  Blindsiding  And then she just sent out an email 
[00:57:00]  That's not even that bad  I was like  She could have been a lot meaner in this  Oh my  She didn't attack you  And man  Stand on the side of the Gowanus  With a big sign  That says I'm sorry  So they pick it up on the traffic  You want the listeners to get involved  Anthony's sorry  We'll have banners all over New York City  By Friday  No I don't think  Getting the listeners involved in this  Is good at all  They're usually great  They usually help us out  When we need them  I got the best idea  It's perfect 
[00:57:30]  How about a video  Taped message  Keith will videotape it  Oh yeah he's good at that  And then he will bring the tape to Jill  Apparently he's very good at videotaping things  Like things being burnt in my yard  No you can't do that  Because if that gets out  That tape is fodder forever  Oh it would get out too  Everything that's wrong with him  Whether he said a word wrong  Whether something happens weird behind him  No you can never give a tape like that  I wouldn't allow that  Well that's our two cents 
[00:58:00]  Yeah I know  Yeah I think it's just  Kevin from Connecticut's got  Perfect  I want to thank Kevin for this one  Kevin go ahead  Tell us what to say  We'll Twitter bomb it  Yeah let's Twitter bomb Jill's  Twitter account  You don't want to Twitter bomb her account  How about you say something right now  The listeners will freaking write it down  And they'll send it to her on Twitter  But I don't know what to say  I have no idea 
[00:58:30]  I don't know if a straight apology is good  I don't know if apology at all  I don't know  Just keep it funny and light hearted  Just write  Right I don't know who that person was  But it certainly was not me  Yeah  No that was me  Personally I think that the anger  That you kind of took out on her  Was meant for other people  Yeah  Say from the past 
[00:59:00]  Yes I was in  No no I was  I was in a rebound situation  That entire time  Yeah  And you know  That didn't help the situation  I guess  I don't know  I don't know what's appropriate  You want to get Mick Foley back involved  No no  I think we keep Mick Foley out  We could get a Steven Singer thing  What is he selling these days  He's selling the long stem roses  Dipped in 24 karat gold  Perfect  No it's not 
[00:59:30]  That's stupid  Perfect  That's right  Look I'm just  This doesn't  I'm teasing of course  I hate Steven Singer  Alright no Mick Foley  It's perfect for Valentine's Day  It's stupid for this situation  Right  Cause then she's gonna get the wrong message  The wrong impression  That's a message of love  Angus has got it  Angus in Jersey  What do you got Angus  Anthony you should use  Doyle's speech  From Sling Blade  Cause you're just  Asshole-ish  I'm out 
[01:00:00]  I apologize  Now I don't think  I said anything to you  Did I Carl  There's no apology needed  Let's see  Kenny  You're an ass  He's just trying to help  Thank you  Okay let's go to  Chris on Long Island  Chris what's going on  Hey what's up boys  Hey  Here's the deal about Anthony's closet 
[01:00:30]  Yeah  Somebody got into that closet  Found some of the content  That was in there  Whether it was a naked girl  Whatever it was  And it screwed up people's lives  So what he did afterwards  Was make sure that nobody  Ever  Is gonna get into that closet again  Fuck  I'm distracted  I'm not a  I'm not a  Big animal rights activist  By any means  But that fucking video  Yeah it's annoying  They're showing on  Probably every news channel today  Especially here in New York 
[01:01:00]  Of the guy kicking the shit  Out of that dog  Who's the guy  In the elevator  Is enraging  Who's the guy  I don't  I'm sure we have the story  In front of us  I'll do a little research  During the break  It's enraging  Oh is he this guy  No no  They've moved on  They've already shown  This video at least 20 times  It's enraging  You know you can do  The whole Chester thing  Blah blah blah  But trust me  You know we have fun  With that for the radio  This motherfucker  It's enraging  When he does that little 
[01:01:30]  Dog in the elevator  Yeah he's really kicking  The shit out of the dog  Sorry Chris  That popped on the TV  That's alright  Finish your thought  If you did  I apologize  I got real distracted there  Yeah that's alright  What I was saying was  That somebody got into  That closet  Found the contents  And it screwed up  People's lives  And so what he did  Was make sure  That nobody was  Ever going to get  Into that closet  Ever again  So he you know  He's got money  He made it  For Knox  I disagree  I don't think it's  That psychological 
[01:02:00]  With the closet  I really don't  Hey here's something  If you weren't  In a rebound mode  Yeah  If you had a good  Solid year off  Yeah  Between relationships  Uh huh  I don't think you did right  I'm trying to  Remember now  No I don't think you did  Um would it  Have worked out  With uh Jill  Uh I  I don't  I  Very hard to say  But I don't  Think we were  You know  Cut out for each other  As far as  She I think  She was looking  For a little more  Well she was on 
[01:02:30]  The fast track  Moving quicker than I was  Right right right  Right right  That's for sure  I remember that  So that was a little bit  You know scary for me  I got a scared  I got a scared  So I had to run away  Somehow  And uh  You blew it up  The funny thing is  People think I blow up shit  You're right there with me  My brother  Well that was one thing  I blew up in my whole life  I've only blown up  A couple things  Christ  Got us more money though  A couple times  Alright dynamite  Alright Chris 
[01:03:00]  Thank you  Why don't we take a break  People still calling  With their advice on this  Good advice  Has everyone  Uh yeah  You know what  Let's go to Ray  In Kalamazoo  Uh Ray  Kalamazoo  Hey boys  Happy birthday Jimmy  Thank you mister  Run  Run  That bitch  Burned up a dead guy  Yeah let's not forget  Yes there was  Uh  Property burnt  And uh  One dead guy  One  One burnt  Dead guy 
[01:03:30]  Ashes  Is the dead guy  Still living in your fire pit  Yeah I would guess so  Probably like streamed out  From the rain and stuff  But  Really what  He's now in your neighbor's yard  Yeah  Has run off water  Yeah run off  A little run off  Into the  Fucking  Great  Septic tank  Buy more guns Ant  Just buy more guns  Buy more guns  That's what makes me smile  Alright Ray  Thanks boys  Punch it out  Thank you  You wanna  You wanna summarize  This whole thing Ant  Uh yeah 
[01:04:00]  I just gotta  I guess think it out  And see if I even  Should  Want to  Need to  You're thinking  Something though  Or  I'm just thinking  Something to  To you know  Closure  No I hate  Not even closure  Closure  Closure  Just making things right  Yeah making things right  Making things right  Right  Fixing something  So you're a little less lonely  In that house  Than yours  No no  It has nothing to do  With my lonely house  You break it up  Not me  With my lonely house 
[01:04:30]  In between parties  It's a very lonely house  I sit there with my lonely fire  Tending my lonely fire  Drinking my lonely wine  You said it  Not me  Texting Danny  To please come over  Talking to your nine friends  Each one of them  Shaped like a bullet  It was a hell of a visual  You laid out  You and your lonely house  My lonely house  We're all jealous  Of your amazing house  But the fact remains  In between parties  It's a pretty lonely place  Hell of an echo in there 
[01:05:00]  Hell of an echo  I've been in there with you  Where it's like  We're barely  Talking  And it's echoing  Through empty rooms  Steve from Bayshore  Anthony's one man  Karaoke parties  They're awful  Where I'll just go downstairs  Maybe  Try out a little tune  You know  It's very rare  In a relationship  That something's 100%  One person's fault  Come on now  I wouldn't give you 100%  But I would have to go 98 too  Yeah yeah 
[01:05:30]  I obviously  Get the giant percentage  In  I was the bad guy  In the whole situation  You know  Because  What are you going to do  You know Anne  She's going to hear this broadcast  It's very hard for  What do you think  What do you think  I thought we were in spots  Yeah she's a psychopath  Stalker  And she'll probably be listening  To this broadcast today  So maybe you're getting it out  By doing it this way  It's just  Therapeutic talking about it 
[01:06:00]  How about this  Jill if you've heard  What Anthony has said  Oh no don't speak for me  Don't fucking put any messages  I just want  All I'm asking for  Is a signal  A signal  That's right  Blow Jim Norton  Yeah  If you accept  A good signal  If you accept  What Anthony's saying today  Blow Jim Norton  Jesus Christ  Passing a nose  Between desks  Right  What is this  No one ever really grows up  No signals  That defeats the whole purpose  What about a text to you 
[01:06:30]  That's just handled  In a mature manner  What about some kind of like  Smiley face to your phone  Or something  No I don't know  If that's appropriate  I don't know  Alright  I don't know  We did what we could for you  Yeah  Maybe you can write  A nice sincere letter  And mail a letter to her  Letters are okay too  Like a real paper letter  Well you type it out  Whatever  And then you send her  Something with it  And it's like  Look I know I fucked up  I fucked up in one like that  Years ago  Did you  Like a court cheating  And it was devastating  To the girl  And it was humiliating  For her  And I really 
[01:07:00]  And my whole relationship  Wasn't my fault  But I'm still guilty  About that  Really  It was a real relationship  See  Yeah  And you know  I apologize  She's on and off  Likes me  Sometimes she doesn't like me  Oh okay  It's a hard thing for women man  When they feel completely  Humiliated like that  I know  I know I was a bad  I was the bad guy  It was your girlfriend  It's different when it's a  It's just  Somebody you don't know  It's a girlfriend  I'm the bad guy  I'm the bad guy  Yeah  Don't do it in character  You want to look at the bad guy  Don't do it in character  No I'm just saying 
[01:07:30]  Just do it as Anthony Cumia  Yeah you're the bad guy  Me and Jimmy will now shut up  And you talk to Jill  Through the radio  Go ahead  Go  Virus go  Go ahead  What  One apology  Looking for one  Lousy apology  One sincere apology  And go  What me now  That's what I said  You're up  Me and Jimmy will shut up  And you talk to Jill  Through the radio  No characters  No buttons  I don't think  I could  Oh  Shut up 
[01:08:00]  Oh  We got the music  And everything for you  Here comes the apology  And go  All right  Here it is  I'm sorry  I did so many bad things  I tried  To do  The right thing  But I'm weak  I'm too fucking weak  Isn't that good 
[01:08:30]  And accurate  How perfect  And that's what you get today  Jill  All right  We're going to take a break  Opie and Anthony  And Jim Norton  Stay there  Let's do this  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  Back from L.A.  How was Leno  Last night Jimmy  It was good man  I enjoyed the topics  And I felt like  There were some good laughs  It was very enjoyable  Is Jay in a good mood  Is Jay confused  He's doing fine  Yeah I mean  Where's Jay at these days 
[01:09:00]  We only spoke for a minute  I actually discussed  My situation with him  More than he did  With his with me  And just chatted  For like five minutes  And then  I think you're going to  See Sandra Bullock  Wait what's your situation  Oh you know  The situation  Yeah  But uh  You know  Hey look  Look what the NBC's doing  It's like no matter  What company you work for  You can have shit  Hit the fan  Or fuck up  Something  How we doing everybody  Remember the first time  Man  Jesus  Oh god  God he was flaming  He was flaming 
[01:09:30]  Yeah  Walking out on that stage  Did you  Did you ever think  That he might be  Yeah  Yeah  Um  Yes as I got older  But in  As a kid you didn't know  Didn't know  No you didn't  Cause it was  How weird is it as a kid  Like all the voices  Sound the same to you  And then you get older  And go wait a minute  What's going on  With that guy's voice  I didn't know  The village people were gay  Oh  Jesus  I remember this lady  Telling me  In the fucking 
[01:10:00]  I love the village people  You know what  I can't lie  I didn't know either  What did I know  Growing up  They had some catchy songs  When you're a little  A little taut  And you're not  Thinking anything past that  You didn't realize  All the songs  Revolved around men  And places where men  Remove their shirts  And get down to their underpants  I didn't know  The YMCA  Was where a lot of guys  Got blowjobs  Yeah  I was fucking eight  I didn't know  Where in the navy  They were tight white slacks  I just thought  They were a little catchy  A woman that worked  As far as pop music goes 
[01:10:30]  At Corvettes  Was telling me  And my friend  They certainly were catchy  Was the line  Someone should have  Fucking grabbed  They were catching  Everything  She worked at Corvettes  And she was  I forget how  I was a kid  I was like ten  And I couldn't believe it  She said no  They really are  They're gay  And so I was asking  What do gay people  Do in bed  She wanted no part  Of me  Oh wow  She's an older woman  I was like  What do gay people  Do in bed  And she hated me  Well they throw  Throw out a lot of sheets 
[01:11:00]  Yes  But Jay's  Doing alright  Oh he seemed okay  Yeah  What do you say about me  He actually  I got a plug  Of course  For you guys  In the company  He even said serious  Which I was surprised at  Wow  Why would you do that  For you guys  Because I love you  So say Opie and Anthony  We're a brand  We're a brand now  Well you know  It's like you gotta  Who knows where  We're gonna continue  This thing  That's true  So let's just get  The Opie and Anthony  Brand out there  Opie and Anthony 
[01:11:30]  Starring Jim Norton  No I just  Opie and Anthony  Is fine  Because they go there  They hear me  You were adorable  In your little picture  In the newspaper  Yesterday  I think it was running  Tomorrow actually  I didn't know  It was running today  But they didn't interview you  Yeah they did  They quoted me on one thing  It was like a couple  Of questions I answered  There was one quote  They just used like  One or two quotes  For every comic  Did we see that  Yesterday again  We were looking  For Jim Norton  I was looking for  I didn't see the quote  I just saw him  With a girl lipstick  All over him  And a  Comic group  With a smiling little face  I happen to have the quote  Oh you do  Yes because the pilot 
[01:12:00]  Getting off the plane  Yeah  He said to me  My wife and I  Are really big fans  And then he handed me  The post article  The actual pilot  Dude I've never  I've never had  A guy who can fly  A plane like me  I think you're  I think you're  Getting famous  It's also just  Still a little  Jimmy Norton  I think you're  Really starting to get famous  He just handed me this  On my way out  And he goes  You can't fly incognito  Anymore  He goes  This was in the post  Yesterday  And he goes  My wife and I  Are big fans  And I said  Thanks for flying  Continental Jim  No  That's pretty cool 
[01:12:30]  Yeah  It was nice  Is he the main pilot  For Continental  He was  He was the pilot  He was an older guy  I'm not that much  I mean 51  52  Did he look like a pilot  Oh fuck yeah  White shirt  It was funny  He had a big gut  He was talking about  How fucking great  The cheeseburger was  He was like a fucking  Man's man  He wasn't one of these  Fruity young guys  He was like an older guy  He's fucking  You can probably fly  The plane with one wing gun  Were you able to stand up there  In the cockpit  And they give you  The little wings  Dude if I would have known  He was a fan 
[01:13:00]  I would have tried to sneak in there  But this is as we landed  At the gate  That's a good question  Are you allowed to go  In the cockpit  After 9-11  No way  No private flight  No way  No  Pilots  No  Maybe a pilot  Or something  On a jump seat  On the bigger planes  But you would never  Get the fuck in there anymore  How safe do you feel  When you see another pilot  Sitting down next to you  Yeah why is that  I don't know  Because you already have  A couple pilots up front  But knowing there's another guy  I just watch his face  The whole time  When those noises happen  That shit  You don't really know  What's going on 
[01:13:30]  And he doesn't budge  You're like okay  This is normal  Oh god  That would be great  To just dress like a pilot  Sit in the seat  And just go like  Oh my god  That would make a great video  Just go  Oh my god  Don't tell me that was  I sure hope that wasn't  Oh my god  And just watch people  Shit their pants  That's the hydronator  The things that don't even exist  Right right right  Just go  Oh that's not good  Just say that a few times 
[01:14:00]  During the flight  Dressed as a pilot  Sitting in  Or even just lean over  To somebody near you  And go  Did you fucking hear that  Did you hear that  Hear what  Oh nothing  Nothing  I hope that's  Not what I think it was  That wasn't turbulence  Yeah  Oh dude  That would rule  Or if you hit a little turbulence  You look over at the guy next to you  And you go  Make the bump stop  I don't like when it's bumpy  I'm scared  You know if we have  Kenny Groh's mustache back  He could almost pull us off  And we get him  Some kind of  Some kind of fucking 
[01:14:30]  Uniform that sort of  Looks pilotish  You're telling him to be a pilot  He'll just hang out  Under a stove  Idiot  You know how much trouble  You'd get in  Just dressed as a pilot  On a plane  It's going to throw you  Right the fuck off  I'm not saying  You're just dressed like  It could be a pilot  That's the key  Yeah but then  It could be anything  You've got to look like a pilot  Yeah  And then just scare people  Alright  I guess  I guess a boy could dream  Yeah  I would love to pull that one off  How did you miss my big quote  Which one 
[01:15:00]  That wasn't a big quote  They just  Honestly  Well because I  I hate the paper  To be honest with you  I'm happy for you  But you know  I got  You know  It was about comedy groupies  Yeah  And my one line  That made it in was  Spotting a comedy groupie  Is easy  Explains Norton  Who admits to having slept  With several fans  Over the past 20 years  Wow  It's always a case of  Hey you're really funny  And kind of creepy  Can we have sex  And that was one of the answers  I submitted  And they used it  Very good  Yes  That's a nice spot for you  And I was fucking  Filling up with these models  On my lap  They were fucking  Really sexy 
[01:15:30]  Really  I thought the blonde  Looked familiar  Do we know her?  We were trying to figure it out yesterday  Don't know  I'm not sure  They told me the agency  They're funny  Did we stick anything in her hiney  Over the years?  I really wish  But no  I don't think so  No  Hey uh  Jimmy you talked about steroids  With Leno last night  Cause you were doing that  Um  What is it called?  It's called  Who Cares What They Think  Who Cares  And it came  That actually came in  Like last minute  One of the  There was another topic  And then Jay bumped it  For that one  Cause the steroids  What's your take on  McGuire and the steroids thing?  Well I kind of said  What I've always said about it 
[01:16:00]  I just did a joke about  How it's not important  And then I just did my  My steroid  Uh  Well Canseco  This guy  He's just a dirtbag  Yeah  Well now he's almost  Canseco says  McGuire's lying about  Never shooting up  Uh  Canseco in the bathroom  And Tony  Uh  La Russa is lying  When he says  He didn't know about it  We said that too  Well if you're the manager  You know that steroids  Is going on  You have to know  You have to  That's why he's almost  Vindicated  Canseco  Yeah he is  He's looking now like 
[01:16:30]  Look I told you guys  This a while ago  No one wanted to believe me  I don't know why  I was just writing a book  And now you find out  A lot of this shit is true  Why do I feel like  Canseco is a dirtbag  When he's probably telling  The truth  More of the truth  Than anybody else  That has come forward  Why is that  Why do I feel that  Because he's a rat  Fucking rat  Because McGuire's  Trying to hold on  To his image  But McGuire  In my opinion  Did a lot of steroids  And it wasn't  Just because he was hurt  Agreed 
[01:17:00]  Yeah  And it's as simple as that  Someone was saying  It was  It was very frequent  And high dosages  Doses  Sorry  Doses of steroids  That was giant  He's smacking  Fucking baseballs  Into orbit  And uh  Saying oh  Well  Yeah I just did it  Because I  Was hurt  And La Russa can't  Come out and say  He knew  Obviously  But he had to have  Of course  You run the team  Plausible deniability  You've seen these guys  Getting bigger and bigger  In the off season  I mean you're not  Suspicious  Doesn't matter 
[01:17:30]  He does seem like  A dick though  Canseco  Like it seems  Even though he's  Telling the truth  I don't think he's  Lying at all  I think he's being  Brutally honest  Yeah yeah  There's something  About the fact  That he's dragging  Everybody down  With him for no reason  That's it  I think it's uh  I think he's breaking  Some kind of like  Man code  I agree  And I think that's why  It bothers me  Because I think  I think Major league  Baseball players  All knew  That they were  Doing steroids  Some guys were  Frustrated  Because they didn't  Want to do it  But they were like  Alright fuck  This is what  This is the culture  Of the business  I'm in  And Canseco 
[01:18:00]  Is the guy  That ratted  Everybody out  He's a rat  He's a rat  And that's probably why  Fucking rat  Because what is he  Getting from it  Publicity  Book sales  Right  It's all for him  It's not to help  The game  No you give a shit  About it  What do you think  You also talked  About Jersey Shore  Last night with Leno  Do you watch Jersey Shore  Little bits and pieces  Yeah here and there  You like the Snooki  No  She annoys me  Oh  Fucking annoying 
[01:18:30]  She's annoying  The guy by the way  Her teacher  Punched her  Is getting fired  I know  Yeah  That sucks  Poor guy  I'll say  The reason it sucks  He probably  Was looked at  As a really good teacher  Until this fucking  Clip surfaced  Yeah  Has he been  A model teacher  In the last year and a half  Well not a year  What  Since last summer  Dude if he has  The ability to do that  Yeah  He's not a good person  That was a rough  If I was another guy  I'd say yeah  But he just  Clocked a chick in the face  Like an amazing  He was shit faced 
[01:19:00]  He's not going to be  Shit faced when he's  When he's uh  Doing his gym teaching  I have been drunk  Off my fucking ass  You could stop right there  I know I did  When insert activity  Just anything  When driving back from  What are they accomplishing  By firing this guy  Because now he's going to  Be in a bad mood  And he's going to  Punch a lot  A lot more bitches  So  Yeah  Now he's all mad 
[01:19:30]  Right  You should let these guys  You should let these guys  Keep their jobs  Because you know  Keep them happy  That punch is just  One for the ages  Oh my god  It spins around  So  I think it's so funny  The hat comes back off too  Yeah  A little hat removal  But you see her  Pointing in his face  And there's a lot of  Women out there  That know they could  Get away with that stuff  I'm not saying you should  Punch a broad  Obviously  And what are you saying  Yeah  I think the punch  I like clarification  I think the punch  Has  Has  Justification 
[01:20:00]  No justification  But I think there's a lot more  Many broads out there  That won't be in your face  With their fingers anymore  Yeah  They'll think twice  You fuck  Fuck  I hope he's right  Holy shit  Am I right  I hope you are  There are women out there  That frustrate the hell out of you  Because they know  They could get in your face  Knowing that  You know  The thing is  Guys aren't supposed to hit  Women  Yeah  And that's kind of frustrating  Well yeah 
[01:20:30]  Everybody's said it  I've never wanted to  Punch a bitch  And that feeling you get  Because you know  You just can't  Because it's not  The right thing to do  There's a time  You would love to  Not so much punch  I'd love to  Open hand  Smack a bitch  Oh like old school  At times  Like an old John Wayne movie  Not now  I'm talking about  One girl  And many years ago  But boy  Would I have loved to  Have just open hand  Slapped her 
[01:21:00]  While she was  Mouthing off  And that was acceptable  Wow  I told you about  The dumb movie  I watched over the summer  Some old western  Where the guy's  Just slapping his wife  You're hysterical  Trying to calm her  Tries to calm her down  By slapping her  Yeah  And then the  The Indian guy  Because it's a western  Brings in some kind of  Like stick  He's supposed to use  To beat his wife  Yeah  But it was acceptable  It wasn't even like  Some weird fucking movie  Where like there was  Abuse going on  This was just  Normal behavior  It's like acceptable 
[01:21:30]  In the fucking 50s  It was on the pier  Give your wife  A fucking smack  It was one of those  Dumb movie nights  On the pier  Where I live  And the audience  Was horrified  They're like  Holy shit  What?  There was a commercial  I think Ronald Reagan  Did it  Where it was  It was about seatbelts  And the line was  And it was a joke line  It was like  And don't forget  To belt your wife too  Like belt yourself up  And then the cop goes  And don't forget  To belt your wife too 
[01:22:00]  Everyone got a good laugh  But that was  That was  It was accepted  People didn't care  It was like  Oh okay  I get it  Hit her  Yeah that's  Like hit her  Or you know  Buckle  That's just the point  I'm making  It was accepted  At one point  To open hand  Slap your wife  Nothing's accepted anymore  No  Nothing  Not that I'm saying  That should be  But we've gone  So far the other way  Where you know  You can't have a guy  That says  Negro dialect  Right  Without him almost  Losing his job  Carolina man  Getting back to McGuire  He had 24 inch biceps 
[01:22:30]  When he broke the record  And he was lifting  Twice a day  No one does that  Imagine  Lifting twice a day  Usually you need  A good day's rest  After you  Lift  Yeah  And this guy  Was lifting  Twice a day  Jesus  We got any clips  There Dan  Alright  Oh  Oh and the full body  Scanners  Anything different  At the airport  Jimmy  No  Not at all  Unfortunately  I would love  Something to be different  Yeah  Same old shit 
[01:23:00]  Security was the exact  Same basically  You didn't have to  Wait any longer  Or you didn't have  I had almost no line  Going there  I mean a ten minute  Line going there  But I came back  On the red ice  So it's like  It's hard  Yeah  They caught that guy  That went under the rope  I know I was here  I think they did  Before I left  Okay  Dummy  The Asian guy right  Yeah  What are they going to do to him  Not much they can do  Because it wasn't intentional  To be a dick  Some kind of trespassing  Bullshit  Play it down to nothing  And once again  We suggest that NYU  Has trampolines 
[01:23:30]  On the sidewalk  Because you lost another one  A professor actually  One of the professors  Jumped  Jumped  At NYU  They like jumping  At NYU  Oh  Kids with bad grades  And bad grades to them  Is like an A minus  Yeah professors  And they lose their mind  This was a young professor  37 years old  And he jumped to his death  That's got to be horrific  Do you know why he jumped?  What?  This selfish asshole  He was having an argument  With his wife  They had just had  Preemie twins  Yeah  And in the middle  Of the argument 
[01:24:00]  I guess she just  Like I've been that angry  Before too  Where that moment  You could do something crazy  He just jumped  Wow  That's it  In the middle of the argument  He just jumped  He probably  That showed her  He probably was  Sleep deprived  Didn't know what he was doing  I bet you he wishes  He had that decision  Oh my  I guarantee  As soon as he cleared the wall  He probably went ugly  Oh that wasn't a good idea  Right  I should have just  Walked away from this argument  Why NYU though?  I don't know what it is  I mean I 
[01:24:30]  We've lived in Boston  It's haunted man  When we were up in Boston  I don't remember anyone  Jumping out of a window  And there's a million universities  Up there  A million colleges  That's the way they like  Doing it over there at NYU  Why?  It's jumping  I don't know  Godspeed  Let's go to Brad  In Rochester  Brad  What's up Brad?  What's up?  I just had a quick comment  About that stick  That you beat your wife with  That's actually where  The term  The rule of thumb  Came from 
[01:25:00]  But I think we already  On our show before  You weren't supposed  To beat your wife  With anything  Wider than  With your thumb  Yeah I don't know  About that though  No I'm  That's serious  Look it up on Snopes  That's  Oh it's on Snopes  Yep  Is it really?  Well Danny  Look it up  And we'll see  If rule of thumb  Is actually  Well you can't hit her  With anything  Bigger than your thumb  Than the width  Of your thumb  But you could do  A lot of damage  With something  That is  Oh yeah  What do I like  Wide as your thumb 
[01:25:30]  Made of metal  Made of metal  Right  And spiky  Yeah  I watched one of those  God damn forensic file shows  Last night  Where a guy  Hit this  Broad up side  The head  With a fucking  Motorcycle  Exhaust  Really?  Oh  And they caught him  This guy was so stupid  Anyway  It was fucking  Forensic shit  All over the place  But  They  The pattern  On the side  Of her head  Had the fucking 
[01:26:00]  Mark  Where the mounting  Bracket  And the hole  Was  And it lined up  Perfectly  With her temple  And the rest  Of the pipe  Lined up  And there was  Blood on the ceiling  And on the floor  And they figured it  They figure that shit out  It's brilliant  That's why I watch those shows  And go  Don't even try to get away  With anything  Just book a trip  To Big Sur  I'm telling you  Yeah the push  The push  The big push  Although they figured out  The push too  Yeah  Because some family 
[01:26:30]  Because I was  Was it on the radio  Sometimes you forget  Some family  Pushed their daughter  I'm not sure  If it was a stepdaughter  I don't know  What the case was  Is that the one  With the pictures  They wanted to get  The insurance money  So they pushed the daughter  How young was she?  I don't remember  The whole story  Maybe we can look it up  I didn't realize  We were going to talk about this  It is always about  Insurance money  With those  With white people  But they somehow  Figured it out  How do you figure out  The push?  They found  Pictures 
[01:27:00]  In a woman's camera  That showed the guy  Right at the moment  Where he pushed her  Over the fucking edge  But you can't tell  That he's doing it  It's a tourist attraction  So you gotta wait  For everyone to get done  With their pictures  And then they walk away  From the ledge  And then you do the push  It's that  It's how they landed  It's scuff  Like scuffle marks  That they've had  Near the edge  The parents had  Stupidly been eating  Chocolate and it was hot  So it was the  Ten fingerprints  In the yellow shirt 
[01:27:30]  On the back  They're on to you  With the cruise ship thing  Don't push your  Ladies off the cruise ships  Anymore  Cruise ship  Rock court  Yeah we were  We were the first  To open that up  That these people  That are going missing  On cruise ships  Are being pushed overboard  By a spouse  That hates them  Yeah  That was obvious to us  From the beginning  Right  Yeah  The  A lot of the cases  Are just  White  A lot of 
[01:28:00]  Just white people  That are trying  To get insurance money  The husband  Fathers  That kill their kids  Trying to get insurance money  And the  The paper trail  Is  Stunningly stupid  I mean  Astoundingly stupid  First 48  Do they do any of those?  No first 48  Is all about  Black people  Shooting each other  That's all it is  Just that  One second  Like the white people  Crimes  The insurance ones  Are thought out  And it takes a while 
[01:28:30]  It's so premeditated  Don't you think  That would be interesting too?  Well  Or no  But it sometimes  Takes longer than  48 hours  To get them  Oh I see what you're saying  First 48 is  Black guy  Looks at another  Black guy wrong  Fucking Jerry Carl  Shoots cookie head  I see what you're saying  I'm stupid  I was thinking  Yeah if you're doing  The pusharoo  It's going to take  A little more than  48 hours  To figure it out  They investigate  Usually those are  On cold case files  Right  Where it takes forever  For them to  To track them down 
[01:29:00]  And figure it out  And then they're just  Guiding this old guy  Out of a building  And he's going  That was in 1972  What happened?  I knew I got away with it  Love those fucking shows though  Dennis D goes  Ope were you just about  To say we were the first  To admit this?

[01:30:30]  Hey Tom  Happy birthday Jimmy  Hi Tom  A few months ago  A friend of mine  Who was attending NYU  Decided that  The 10th floor  Of the library  Was a good place  To jump off  They have barriers  Like plexiglass  Barriers  All around the  That big  In their library  And apparently  All you need to do  Is push a table  Up next to it  And you can just  Get right over  So  Hey Doug  Love that sound 
[01:31:00]  Did your friend jump?  Yeah  He  He was  I don't know  What was going on  In his personal life  But everyone else  Who like knew him  Which is  You know  That's how the story goes  Why don't you ask him  What was going on?  You know what?  Apparently he had this  He was like  He lived up in like  Westchester  And walked from NYU  To his house  Every day?  Like  I think like  Maybe like  Twice just to get  A feel of how it is 
[01:31:30]  Dude he was just  It's sad and depressing  Alright thank you  Hey  Breaking news  From Cosmo Radio  Let's go to  James in Chicago  I don't know why  James is listening  To Cosmo Radio  But he is  James  I listen to it  Because it's  10 minutes of  Jacktober  Every day of the year  Oh really?  That's a nice way  To put it  That is a good way  To sell that  To our listeners  I don't want to say  Anything bad about  The company  But anyway  They were talking 
[01:32:00]  About you  And Club Soda Kenny  Walking by their  Studio  And talking about  What a creepy  Lurch Kenny was  And why  I don't know  I guess  You guys  Or he gave him  A shitty look  Because of  The sweater party  Or whatever it was  But I wanted to let you know  That they were talking  About you during the break  Oh can we get that audio?  Kenny is very intimidating  And he walks around  These halls  But he knows everybody  Yeah  You just point to someone  And he'll give you  Their whole bio  I know who that is  And where they work  And what they do 
[01:32:30]  And how long  They've been here  Let's try to find that audio  I want to see what they were  Saying about us today  Thanks James  No problem  Before we completely  Attack them  And destroy them  We'll find out  What they said  I'm always scared  About like  Listening to what people  Say  Especially girls  Why?  Actually only girls  Why?  Guys I could give a shit  What they say  But girls it's like  Aw that was hurtful  There's no lookers  Around here  There's like one or two  There's a couple  There's a few  A few of these gals  Are eye candy  A few of these slits  There are a few  Slits 
[01:33:00]  Trying to make it  In broadcasting  And I call them slits  There's a couple  Hot slits  Around here Jimmy  Yeah  A couple nice  Dishes  Yeah  Nice  Nice  Yeah  Dish  Nice hot pockets  Nice  Hot pockets  Jeff  Make her come  Like did you move  The dam out of the way  And the water just  Came flooding through  That's how good 
[01:33:30]  She'll come  Of course  Make her come  Like crazy  Yeah  Funny  Okay  We got a  We got a pushing story  And we got Laura  In Washington  Laura what do you got  Good morning everyone  Hey  Hi  I kind of  Am of the theory  Of pro slapping women  Yeah  Let me explain why  I've been in situations  Where women have  Called off  And smacked  Or punched guys  And y'all can be  In a bar  And y'all can fight 
[01:34:00]  And everything's kosher  I honestly believe  That if a woman  Comes up and punches you  You ought to be able  To punch her back  Before she punched you  That's different though  That doesn't work  No I don't think  Jimmy I don't think it is  I think if a girl  Hold on  If a girl  You're in a bar  And a girl comes up to you  And slugs you for any reason  And you slug her back  You're looked at  Like the biggest dirt bag  Even though she  Hits you first  Oh I just meant  That it was different  Than the Snooki situation  Because she didn't  Hit him first  Oh right  Right  Right  Right  She was just 
[01:34:30]  Abnoxious  Understandably though  But women want  All these equal rights  They want to go  Fight and come back  They want to have this  They want to have that  Trust me  I'm for equal rights  For women  I work really hard  And I just don't think  It's right  That we don't have  The same theories  With all sexes  As long as you only  Hit her with  Before she hit you  Well that's hard to  Prove or  You know  What are you going to do  Of course it is  Use some kind of  A torque wrench  On your arm  And know how many pounds  Of square inch 
[01:35:00]  Per second  Per second  She by the way  This woman has had  This conversation before  How many times  Have you had this  Conversation before  And don't lie  Or I'll know  How many times  Have I had this  Conversation before  Yes  This is actually  The very first time  It's not  You've rehearsed it  To yourself  Well of course  I rehearsed it  Before I called y'all  You're like Bob Kelly  Exactly  Breaking news  Earthquake leaves  Haiti in ruins  Oh we knew that  No I know  Thanks guys  Punch it out

[01:39:30]  Easy as like  I don't know  Fucking going  One two three  Go to  Pie  Go to Target  Get a fucking  Coat hook  Easy Japanese  And just  You know  Fucking drill it  Into the wall  This thing  Was a major issue  For Sirius XM  Major  Why the big expense  I was watching the emails  Going back and forth  They had to get approval  From this person  This person was a  And then this guy  Had a  And then he had a  And then he moved it  To this guy  Who had a sign off  And then this guy  And then finally 
[01:40:00]  Yeah they didn't want to  Put a hole on the wall  Almost a month later  I got a  A nice coat hook  There it is  No joke  It should have been  Easy as  Okay no problem  And something was here  The next day  That should have been  A coat hook  Corporate America  Just amazes me in general  I'm not even  Trashing the company  I'm just saying  Corporate America  In general  It's just amazing  Yep  It's just a stupid  Coat hook  Is Mars around  To explain the process  That it took  To get the coat hook  What's worse  The process  That it took  To get the coat hook 
[01:40:30]  Or Mars  Explaining the process  Well he's always good  On the radio  No Mars is terrific  On the radio  You really  Really got to get on  Team Mars  Here he comes  Mars  Now  Good morning gentlemen  Good morning Mars  I know you want to  Protect your own job  Around here  So I understand that  But Anthony and I  Are asking you  To just explain  What it took  To get this fine  Coat hook  Behind me  Well after  It took a little bit  Because what they  Had a problem with  Is cutting through  The soundproofing material 
[01:41:00]  So that needed  Approval  Now what needed  To be cut through  If there's just  Two screws going  Into the wall  And what could that  Possibly do  As far as a broadcast  Go  Yeah  One little hole  In this beige  Piece of crap  Well everybody  Was trying to  Cover their ass  Because they were  Thinking that  Making holes  In that soundproof  Material was going  To deteriorate  The audio quality  In here  So that guy  Wanted to take  Care of himself  So then they  Passed it along  To someone else  And someone  Didn't want to  Really give the okay 
[01:41:30]  So they passed it  Along to someone else  Not putting in a vault  It's like  Putting up a coat  Why does everything  Have to be over  Over what  Overanalyzed  Over thought  Over douched  Over douched  Over douched  Over douched  Is a perfect way  Perfect way  To explain that  What are you talking about  So one little hole  Could fuck up  The sound of our broadcast  Well that was  One particular  Department's take on it  Jimmy blows his nose  Into the mic  I mean 
[01:42:00]  Exactly  Do they understand  What we do  With our time here  Yeah  We fart into these mics  Who cares if there's  A little hole  In this  Soundproofing material  You know  Jeopardize the  Acoustic  Integrity  When did I ask  For this  For real  For real  For real  It was definitely  Before the Christmas  Vacation  It was probably  Early December  Early December  Now  Mid January  We got it  Which is nice  And I thank the  Company for that  Sure  I had other people  Listening right now  And as I'm walking  Out of the shop  They're saying  They shouldn't be 
[01:42:30]  Cutting through  That fucking material  And all this  And all that  Are you kidding me  But that's okay  So it's just another worker  Why they act like  You're trying to put in  Some kind of  Football display case  Or something  What it really is  Shut the fuck up  You think Chip  Gives bad examples  Yes  Always  What I think it really is  Is that we're asking  For things other people  Don't ask for  So they go  Oh we've never done  That before  Well let's see  How many people  Are listening to  Their fucking show  Understood  Enough already  It's a stupid  Coat hanger

[01:43:30]  We're just getting  Facts from you Mars  About five or six emails  Jimmy just threw  His phone back  I actually now hear  Your Opie's voice  Though echoing  Off of the  Coat hook  That could be a problem  Yeah yeah  It's echoing off of it  They put a hole  In the stuff  For the fire alarm  Yeah  So what's the difference  No they didn't disturb  The fire  Right  That's what  That's what  I brought up to them  What about this  Giant hole  Where the  Outlet is sticking out  Fuck that  What about that  Eye beam  That's coming through  The wall  For no fucking reason 
[01:44:00]  That's a huge hole  Through the south  Whatsoever  What are they talking about  Yeah that's your code  I thought about that  Actually  Hanging something off  Yeah and there's  A hung ceiling  In this place  What are they talking about  It's not like it's  Acoustically sound  Look we have the easiest  Jobs in America  And for some reason  People want to make it  Complicated  I just  Will never understand  Pleasantry  This is the  Yeah this is  Pleasantry  These are just pleasantries  To help everybody around here  We don't have to  Overthink everything  Just go with it  Man  Go with it

[01:47:00]  Nails in the walls  Mars  Can you give me some  Nails and a hammer  For tomorrow show  Absolutely  Oh wow  Fucking Mars  You crazy  Watch him get electrocuted  As you put a fucking  Nail through a  220 line  A lot of people  Would enjoy that  I'm sure  So what were they  Saying on Cosmo Radio  Something about Kenny  Yeah well they saw  OP and Kenny  Walking  I guess they see  Them walking a lot  Because their  Studio is kind of  Near where  The  Connected at the hip  You do  But they describe 
[01:47:30]  Kenny as being  OP's bodyguard  Yeah  Kenny walks  When Jimmy's around  And when Anthony  Anthony rarely walks  Around the place  But Kenny just  Walks with us  Because we talked  To him  No they said  He's your bodyguard  And that  Protect me from  Water around here  Well as they said  They were surprised  Because this is  Such a secure area  That you would  Need a bodyguard  One of the girls  Said that they  Wanted a bodyguard  Like Kenny  But then the  Rest of the show  Pointed out  And had a good  Laugh  At how poorly  A job of guarding 
[01:48:00]  A job of guarding  A body Kenny  Must do  Wow  As he's so slow  And lurch like  That he certainly  Couldn't protect  Anyone from attack  Like a lumbering beast  Like a zombie  You could just run  Away from him  Like a moronic zombie  Oh a moron zombie  Like a stupid  Big  Know nothing  A galoot  Yeah  A big galoot  A hulking  Yeah  Nothing  Just a mass  Of waste of space  Uselessness  Yeah  Just a pile of meat 
[01:48:30]  With eyes  Yeah  Over six feet  Of idiocy  Yeah  Kenny  Would you like  To respond  Now Kenny  This is your forte  This is now  This  You take this  Seriously  Because you are  A security man  I will give my life  For you guys  See  Just like the  Secret service  Only stupid  It's funny  That you say  Secret service  Because you know  How Kenny  Has the radio monitor 
[01:49:00]  In his ears  Oh yeah  So he can hear  What's going on  On the show  Yep  They mocked that  And said  He has an earpiece  In his ear  It's surely  Just a regular radio  That he wears  To try to look important  Oh  Kenny  Oh Kenny  Does this make you feel bad?  The slow  And oh fish  And stupid  Oh fish  Is a good word  Oh  Did they use oh fish  Or are you just  Pumping it up a little bit?  Somebody might have written it  Wow  Now this is something 
[01:49:30]  That I don't agree with at all  I think Kenny  Is very proficient  In helping everybody out  Protection  I feel very secure  When I'm with Kenny  Proficiency is different  Than intelligence  Exactly  You don't have to be smart  To be good at  You know  You have what is called  Instincts  Right  Common sense  Yeah well  Slow down  Instincts  Like if there's something  Going on 
[01:50:00]  Kenny can sense it  Like shenanigans  If  He can look around  But then again  So could a big dumb animal  That's true  You know even a zebra  At a watering hole  Knows when the lions  Are around  They poke their head up  But they are  Just stupid animals  Yeah  So you're like a zebra  I don't got stripes  But I am dumb  You're a lot more  To us than that  You're a lot more  Than a blithering lummox  Yes 
[01:50:30]  They also  I guess their office  Is near Ron and Fez's  Office upstairs  Oh really  And the guy said  There's some weirdo  In the office  Next to us  Who some days  He wears a full toupee  And some days not  Oh no  They don't even know  It's a bit  No they said  They have no idea  It's a bit  They don't know  Why he's doing it  Unless it's for something  Why would they know  What good radio is  They thought maybe  He's got four months  Left to live  Those people are  Bad neighbors  Yeah yeah 
[01:51:00]  Everybody else is neighborly  I'm surprised  Ladies and gentlemen  It's Troy Kwan  Running down the hall  This could be  Some breaking news  Oh here we go  This is the audio  Yeah  We got permission  Yep  Thank you Craig Schwab  Who we used to work with  Thank you  Remember Craig  We even get along  With Shade 45  We get along  With everybody  Out Q  No not everybody  The monster steward chicks  Grumpy old man  That has to take a dump  Every time I'm in there  There's always exceptions  But for the most part 
[01:51:30]  The engineers  Yeah  Alright you ready  To hear this Cosmo radio thing  I am so ready  Wait a second  So  Opie has a bodyguard  He's not a body  He's not a body  There's no context  To it either  They obviously  Just saw you  Walking by  And out of nowhere  They were talking  About people  Who work here  And then  I like  I like this chick's voice  By the way  I've heard her before  That's that raspy  I like that raspy voice  I just woke up  I like that voice  What does she look like Kenny 
[01:52:00]  I wouldn't know these people  If I tripped over them  They're bad neighbors  Kenny  Yeah that's that raspy  Kind of fucking  I heard her before  I kind of like her voice  Like morning voice  That's good  Right after  Eat some of my throat yogurt  Kenny you want to go on their show  And explain what you do for us  Because they're a little confused  No fuck them  You want to hear  Club Soda Kenny  You hear him exclusively 
[01:52:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show  Alright I like those  See the loyalties there  He's like a big dumb dog  Sam  Yes  He's very loyal  Can you bring him in there though  That would be kind of fun  Oh god  Look at poor Sam  Physically I probably could  I've heard this girl  I think she'll  I think she'll play along with us  I really do  I mean  Is she the one that had  The sweater thing going on  Yes  This is I think the same girl  Who was very upset  When we went down  To their studio last time  Wait a second  So Opie has a bodyguard  He's not a bodyguard  I think he is 
[01:53:00]  He has like  He has like  Like a weird  Yeah like he's in the  He's like in the  It must be like a radio  That he's listening to  Yeah he might be a driver  Or something  I'm not  Then why is he with him  All the time  Driver stays in car  Yeah I think it's like  A regular radio  That he's just listening to  It's like a transistor radio  That he's making himself  Look important  By having it  He looks like Secret Service  For real  Huge Secret Service  Definitely not  Except he's not  I want a bodyguard  Uh hello  I want to fire him  You want that bodyguard  You're firing me 
[01:53:30]  Yeah I think I want him  Can I borrow him from Opie  Do you think he would let me  Borrow his bodyguard  For the day  Get that chick in here  Yeah now we got it open  Now we got an open invitation  To go in there  Yeah  Because she asked a question  So Kenny  We're certainly going to give you up  To the Cosmo radio broad  You could be her bodyguard  Yeah but we got to do it on our turf  So I'm protected  It's like the movie bodyguard  Yeah  You could sweep her off her feet  It's true  I don't want to try it  I like this broad  I don't know much about her  I've heard her show a few times 
[01:54:00]  Yeah but get her in here  I'm scared to go in there  See what she looks like  Can someone see what she looks like  Snap a picture  Snap a pic  Get a pic  Get a pic  Snap a pic  Do they have any pictures on the website  Oh that's a good point  Wake up with Taylor  What  For the day  You don't want that bodyguard  I have lots to do today  I could use some assistance  He could probably like  Carry me around his shoulders  All day  That guy walks around  I say money on cabs  He walks around so slow  I think even if you were accosted  By the crazy man this morning  That guy wouldn't even  Yeah  Yeah that's what I said 
[01:54:30]  Slow moving  Yeah yeah  What am I rushing for  I've got four hours to kill around here  Exactly  Where are you running to  Yeah what am I rushing for  Why would  Unless something's going on  I don't get the whole slow moving thing  Unless there's a code blue  Right  Where  What is he  Should he be running back and forth everywhere  Look man  We take our breaks  I usually find Kenny  And we just talk  We just talk  Yeah we exchange pleasantries  Yeah we just kill  All we're doing is killing a little time 
[01:55:00]  In between breaks  Which is which  There Dan  I think  Well the show's called  Wake up with Taylor  Yeah  And I'm pretty sure that this broad here  On the left  Is Taylor  They're both fantastic  And then  I don't know who that is  I've never seen these broads  So I don't know  I haven't seen her walk in the hallways or anything  Yeah  I think they just  They go upstairs  Can you go down that picture a little bit  Uh oh  I don't mean sideways  Sidewise  I just mean  Yeah yeah go up  And then  And then just scroll down 
[01:55:30]  That's the whole thing  Yeah but make it bigger  I'd give you the one  Now scroll down  Okay  I just want to see a little  I see an arch there  Yeah she's got some going on  There's some  Is she the one with the  The raspy voice  To mean more voice  You know what  She's alright man  I ain't gonna  I ain't gonna  Most women broadcasting are pigs  I ain't gonna complain about that  But this one is alright  She's a looker  There's not many lookers in broadcasting  It's alright  Right  Get her in here 
[01:56:00]  What do you want to do to her guys  I think we should get her in here and talk  Talk it out  Well I  But I think we should sit  Fucking Kenny in the corner  With a hat with a propeller on it  And make him hold like a  Spirally lollipop  While we interview her  Can we just do that  Or a sideways police hat  And an ice cream cone  Like he's lost  Any more images  Those are two really good ones 
[01:56:30]  Poor little Kenny  Yeah  I was  I'm not trying to offend anyone  I'm saying he moves around very slowly  I'm protecting you  He is protecting you  He's protecting you  I know  But I don't mean anything  Other than he moves very slowly  Like a big lurch  Right  I knew that  Yes  And I don't think  It's gotta be hard to move all that weight around  I don't think he would have been able to  Help you  You don't think he'd be able to help me  I don't think he's a very effective bodyguard  No  Yeah  Leave her  Alone  Right  Exactly  By the time he finishes his sentence 
[01:57:00]  The guy's like pummeling me  Yeah  It's the Chris Harrison bodyguard  Boring  Leave  Her  Boring  Alone  Does Howard Stern have bodyguards?  He has security  Same thing right?  Um  He's got Ronnie  His limo driver and stuff  I mean  I mean that's it  I've never seen Ronnie  Is he a big guy?  No  You know Ronnie  No I don't  I know of him  I don't know him  Well I saw one picture one time  Because of something  That we can't talk about  But  That's all 
[01:57:30]  Oh yeah  Um well no  But they  You know we  There's like secret entrances  And stuff  He just bounces in and out  There's no  And there's security all over the place  I don't necessarily  I'm saying that's like cool  Like he doesn't need  Like he's Howard Stern  And he doesn't even have a bodyguard  No  I mean he's protected  It's not like he's like  Out in the open a lot  He has  He has a security team  That works here  And probably one that works in his building  And that's probably the end of it  Right  Like he doesn't have like a bodyguard with him  When he goes to restaurants with  No  That would be  That would be  Wow  Ronnie  The banality of this conversation 
[01:58:00]  Is mind boggling  Yeah  He doesn't have a bodyguard  Because he has like a labyrinth  A labyrinth  Sirius XM gave him a labyrinth  To get in and out of this place  We've been here  Nine months I think  Right  In this building  Nine glorious months  Glorious  Jimmy  Glorious  And we haven't seen him once  Not a once  He's got a labyrinth  We don't even know how he gets in and out  At this point  No clue  Ronnie does  I would assume 
[01:58:30]  That if something were to go down  Or something  Yeah but Ronnie's not like  Sitting in the booth with them  Or is he  No  No  You mean the radio booth  I mean like a booth in a restaurant  No  That was totally unexplained  Oh like  No  No  I don't think he's  No  No  No he lives  He's a regular  But this guy follows Opie around  In the studio  In the hallways of Sirius  Which we're completely protected  Because we have security everywhere  Yeah I don't know what that guy does  He just stands around  And just kind of like  Mopes and walks  Eats breakfast every day 
[01:59:00]  I want a moper  I'm jealous  I want to get me one of those  Be patient  I want a broken bag  And I want him  No I'm  Neither of those guys  Had mopers around them  When they were  You know  They were youngins  You don't just get security  Right away  You gotta  Too much too soon Kenny  Something bad's gotta happen  Something bad did happen today  Yeah  I got a little bit scared  Wake up with Taylor  This is Cosmo  She laughs like  She laughs  Like Janis Joplin 
[01:59:30]  At the end of Mercedes Benz  Oh yeah yeah  A little scratchy laugh  I like that scratchy voice  I like that scratchy voice  Is that her?  That's Taylor  Yeah  That's a different one  Than the ones you were showing us  They're all hot  That's the same chick  Same chick  Is that really her?  Yeah  The other picture  She had blonde hair  If Taylor's the Demi Moore sound  That one  Wow  They're really giving you a beating  Whoa what's with that booty?  Ah booty  You wanted to take that ass there  I knew she had something going on  What do you think Kenny?  It's about you  No no no 
[02:00:00]  Let them judge me  Alright  That'll be the last thought  That goes through their head  Once I rip their arms off  And beat them to death with them  Kenny  That's not nice  Why would you even suggest  Doing something like that?  You can take criticism  I know  But I just love violence also  I say  Let he or she  Without sin  Cast the first stone  I don't know what that means 
[02:00:30]  See they're  Criticizing you  And stuff  And meanwhile  I'm sure  They're not perfect people  What's more of an accurate example  With him  Would be  Let he or she  Without extra chromosome  Cast the first stone  It's a perfect  What's going on around  That's when she  Looks like she burnt her mustache off  With some nair  Is that what happened?  Well it says  Taylor's nair disaster  Jesus  And she's got some redness  On the sides of her  Of her mouth  Yeah 
[02:01:00]  What she have a handlebar?  Yeah wow  She's rocking the Steve C  It looks like  Yes  I get stretch marks  On my mouth  That are red like that  From other things  Those cool eyes  I mean  Let's get  She looks nuts  Let's get Kenny on  Cosmo radio  What a kook  And a million crazy chicks  Why don't you guys  Try to get on Cosmo radio  Alright  Hey did anyone see  American Idol by the way?  I did  Has we switched subjects?  Is it the same old shit?  Of course it is 
[02:01:30]  Well I mean it's  The same format  But it stinks  They make believe  These guys  There's no Paula though  Well the bad auditions  Where they make believe  They were caught off guard  Are they doing that again this year?  Yeah  Well yeah  It was fun the first year  Because you didn't know  What it was about yet  But then year after year  It's like  Alright  She's going to show us  The bad auditions  They had some bad ones  And some good ones  Yeah  Yeah  But the bad ones  Were they  What is she doing?  She's showing  How she burnt her skin  Using Nair 
[02:02:00]  To get rid of  Her mustache  She has a mustache?  You know what that means?  I guess if you're using Nair  On your upper lip  You know what that means though?  A lot of hair  Nice  Yeah  Nice  Keeps all that smelling  Big  I like it  I like to grow a little bit  Of a mustache  She eats like sardines  Or something  You can taste it  When you kiss her  It's nice  My mother has one  It's cute  It actually makes  A little sense though  Sure it does  Any more?  Yeah 
[02:02:30]  There's probably  Some stuff happening  Let's see  I'm a little  I'm a little fixated  On her right now  Even the bad pictures  Are kind of funny  You know  They have a lot  Of photo galleries  I gotta try and plow through  What is she doing there  With a mustache?  Exactly  She's got a little mustache there  Can we see it?  Were they goofing on her?  Yeah  Obviously  Oh yeah  See  Cause now I can see some  Let me see  If you can get her arms 
[02:03:00]  Out of the way  Of there  Okay  What is she doing?  I don't know  Looking like Gallagher  Yeah  I don't know what to do  With this Cosmo radio  I want to go look at it  Where's their studio?  Well we can take a break  You can walk by  Then we can maybe  You want to go over  The American Idol audio  This year?  Is it any good?  Everybody's talking about it  Is it worth going over?  No one is talking  About American Idol this year  And I want to talk  About the Avatar thing  People are getting depressed  Over Avatar  Why? 
[02:03:30]  Well we'll explain why  After the break Anthony  Gotta keep people tuned in  Nice  You guys take a look  At Cosmo radio  Try to get Kenny  On the air  Please  Okay  To confront them  And then  We'll take a break  And we'll continue  That's what we'll do today  Alright  Lumbering Kenny  Yeah we were talking 
[02:04:00]  About the earthquake  What about  Oh some people's  People's is asking  If we had talked about it  Yeah I don't know  What to say about that  It sucks  It's pretty bad  Down there in Haiti  Port-au-Prince  The capital's pretty much  Just destroyed  The royal  Or whatever it is  The big palace there  That they  Have all their big wigs in  Gone  Really?  Yeah  And I think what  The UN ambassador  Got smashed  Really? 
[02:04:30]  Or something  Oopsie  How do they judge  They said it's the worst  Earthquake in 200 years  How do they judge that?  You know  It might have been  You know  I guess  On the  Richter scale  Could be worse  But then on the scale  As far as damage  And human life goes  Like what was going on  200 years ago  In Haiti  Yeah  I probably wasn't  Much different  To tell you the truth  I went to Haiti once 
[02:05:00]  You didn't go to Haiti?  Yeah I bet  When?  On a cruise ship  Is there a safe part of Haiti?  It's one little part  I'm not even kidding  Because  And safe?  Because I go to  Turks and Caicos a lot  And  Man they can't wait  To get off that  Freaking island  And they're always  Well  They're always like  Dying trying to get  To Turks and Caicos  It's  As safe as it can  Could be I guess  But it's you know  You don't see anything really 
[02:05:30]  They just keep you  On the beach  Right  But  It was  It wasn't  Nice  It was probably  The worst place  I've ever been  On vacation  In the Caribbean  And that's the nice part  Of Haiti  Yeah  And I  I've been to Columbia  So  That was really bad  Are you a drug lord?  I try to be  So  So  So  They're worried  About a coat hanger  But  A coat hook  But I've got to  Eat on the air  Because I'm starving  I hope this doesn't 
[02:06:00]  Affect the sound  It's the  Virus  Morning breakfast show  Breakfast  I named that  Someone put our heads  On bodies  Of people dressed  As bacon and eggs  By the way  I saw that  That's very good  That was funny  Whoever did that  Thank you  We were dressed  As bacon and eggs  We got lots going on  We got Kenny  Going on Cosmo Radio  In a little while  Because what she said  Was honey  She's like your twin  See we're all hooked up  So we get to hear  Kenny on Cosmo Radio 
[02:06:30]  Sam you gonna do it too?  Yeah  You and Kenny?  Yeah me and Kenny  Are going on  Get to the bottom  Of the whole bodyguard thing?  Yeah  And also I'm finding out  Anthony  That we got  Two guys in studio  That enjoy American Idol  Uh yeah  That's right  Yeah  Sam and Danny  Yeah  Danny I'm surprised at you  Danny I am really surprised at  Sam watches all this  Although Danny's a musical guy  No I mean you know what it is  If I'm gonna watch Idol  I'll watch just the auditions  Like once it actually becomes 
[02:07:00]  A real competition  I could care less  And usually  In the past  I mean the auditions  Have like held me  But uh  Unfortunately last night  I was held up until  Like the first ten minutes  And I was like  You know what  I really just don't care about this  I can't  My drop off  As far as American Idol goes  Is epic  I was actually into the show  And then last year  I don't even really know  The first thing about Adam Lambert  Two years  It's been for me  It's been two years for you  I have not even  But I would watch the auditions  And watch these guys  Just making fools of themselves 
[02:07:30]  I think the only season  I actually watched like through  Was with uh  The salt and pepper hair guy  Oh Taylor Hicks  Yeah Taylor Hicks  Yeah  I don't know  I wanted to see him win  For some reason  And so I got into it  And watched the whole thing  But that was like  That was the only time  I ever watched it  As far as like  The competition part  Yeah the whole thing  Yeah  Why is it that the guy  That's supposed to win  Never wins by the way  Because  That is so weird  I'm for real  No it's easy  Chris Autry doesn't win  The whole thing  Are you kidding me  Strictly business  Who won Chris Autry's year  Then they get two winners 
[02:08:00]  They get two winners  They get the guy  That should have been the winner  And then the guy  That actually has the title  And now they can make  Twice the money  Adam Lambert's gonna sell CDs  Regardless if he wins or not  Chris Allen on the other hand  If he comes in second  Is not gonna sell  Did he win Chris Allen  Chris Allen won last year  Has he had a song out  He has a song out now  Is it good  I mean it's kind of  A typical American Idol song  No is it good as far as  Okay  Who was the fruit and the fat black guy  What year was that  That was season two 
[02:08:30]  Yeah  Aiken and Ruben Studdard  Yeah yeah  See Ruben Studdard won that  Yes  But Aiken was very successful  Financially with  And I think  Record sales  I think they were trying to do it  As far back as season one  When Justin Guarini  Came in second place  Well  Cause he had Justin Timberlake hair  And they thought he could pull it off  Of course they did  Justin Guarini  Justin Guarini  He was the curly hair dude  Yeah yeah yeah  Is he gonna fuck  Whether they said fuck Paul Abdul  Or no  That was the guy  No  That was another guy  Hey we gotta go back to Haiti for a second 
[02:09:00]  Dave in Texas  Went on a cruise ship to Haiti  And his experience  Cruise ship to Haiti  Well Anthony did too  Did you  Yeah there was a stop there  Does it have fucking oars  It was terrible  No the cruise ship was great  But it stopped everywhere  And then on the way back  They stopped at Haiti  Right  And I was just like  Why am I in Haiti  Did you Haiti it  Haiti did  Oh my god  Boo  David in Texas has a good story  Go ahead David  Good evening

No  I'll carry my own AK  I don't need a caddy  Walk out into the fairway  So that we would end up  Like hitting our golf balls  Near him  I'm scared to death  If I hit him 
[02:10:30]  He'd turn around  And shoot my ass  No  Did he tip him well?  Uh  That was pain  I don't fucking know  Tip like a buck  And they fucking  Freak out  Of course  They were a million dollars  Over there  That's a lot of money  For them  There was ladies  Like living under shanties  Just holding up  Like five golf balls  Just yelling  Were they?

That's the rumor  Get out 
[02:14:00]  What do you mean?  No just get out  Oh do I hate that  Get out  Mr. fucking E-Entertainment  Are you excited?

[02:14:30]  I have never seen  American Idol  For real?  Not a one?  Good for you  Not a one  Good for you  Not a one  Don't drink the Kool-Aid  Here's the question  Then let's  We'll leave  Okay  No I'll answer the questions  I'm going to answer your questions  I'm sorry  First of all  Okay what are you going to sing?  I'm going to sing  House of the Rising Sun  You know that song?  Oh  I'm just  Okay  Andrew  You are really pushing this  No  All right  I'm just going to sing it  I'm sorry  I'm just going to sing it 
[02:15:00]  I'm just going to push any buttons  All right  Okay  Here we go  There is a house in New Orleans  It's called the Rising Sun  And it's been the ruin of many poor boy  And God I know I'm one  My mother was a tailor 
[02:15:30]  I predict he gets cut off real soon  She sewed my new blue jeans  My father was a gambling man  Way down in New Orleans  When did Jamie Farr hit the gong?  You don't like that air?  No  That was really bad  Yeah it was kind of shitty 
[02:16:00]  Well  Boy I can only imagine what  What Simon has to say  Simon  Are you angry?  Am I angry?  I'm very on edge  Tell us what happened  What happened?  I just am on edge from waiting all day  From what?  Just from waiting  Well you know the thing is  You want to be in the music business  But you don't want to wait  To get into American Idol  That to me seems to be a problem  That's a good point  And you know for you to have  A bad attitude about that  Kind of pisses me off  No I don't have a bad attitude  I think you're reading it too far  No no I'm not reading it too far 
[02:16:30]  Because you just told me  That you were a little bit annoyed  That you had to wait three hours  To come in here and get your shot  When there are people that would wait  Years to do so  So I am now angry at you  Who I don't like at all  She annoyed me Jimmy  I honestly thought Simon  Was genuinely annoyed  Because I watched this clip  All last time  I thought he was actually  Genuinely annoyed  At the guy being a snotty little twat  Yeah  She was kind of annoying though  She was like  It was like alright we get it  You're the gal that doesn't take guff 
[02:17:00]  Seeing a bunch of O's after it  Hey guys  Michelle's calling back  From Mississippi  Michelle  Hi guys  Hi  What do you got for the show Michelle?  Well we were just talking  About the American Idol thing  The other day  About the talent  I mean the only three  That you really hear from  These days  Is Kelly Clarkson  Carrie Underwood  And Chris Daltrow  And with the exception  Of Carrie Underwood  Kelly and Chris  Were both back  You know  Way back there  Well you raise a good point  Because when his European tour 
[02:17:30]  Didn't go the way they thought  The routing had to get switched  Yeah  So  Your point about Kelly Clarkson  Is excellent  Because there was that  There was that whole one issue  With the tax  Yeah  And people weren't sure exactly  What the whole thing was  What the thing was about  Without it  Without the  Yeah you know about that Michelle?  What was that again?  What was that?  Yeah because we're trying to remember  No I was just talking about  The talent guys  I mean you guys are great  No no we agree with what you said 
[02:18:00]  The talent you're right  About what you were saying about them  Yeah well  Right  It's just the only  It's been  The show has been going on  For like how many years now?  And they only hear from  Three people really  Right  Who are the three people  You hear from?  Yeah yeah  Which three again?  I'm trying to remember  Kelly Clarkson  Carrie Underwood  And Chris Doffrey  Well are y'all just like  The way I talk?  No no but  Your point about  Ruben Studdard  Becoming a circus elephant  Is that true?  Yeah I've heard it 
[02:18:30]  Actually I think  I think he was at the circus  The last time we went  Oh Mrs.  It's Ms. Chip  It's Ms. Chippison  Ms. C  Ruben Studdard lived in the same building  As a good friend of mine in L.A.  And we would see him all the time  In his big  It was like a big red Hummer  And he would just drive  There was a KFC  Like half a block away  On I think it was on Wilshire  And he would just  Be constantly going there  And coming back  With huge buckets  Well come on  Being from the south  He is from Alabama 
[02:19:00]  No I know  It's just  You know  He's not  He's not svelte  Yeah exactly  Right  Fucking heart  Is made of paraffin  He's trying to go get that chicken  I mean he's from Alabama  We understand this  And there's another reason  We're at chicken  All right  Have a good day guys  All right  Miss Sippy  Thank you  Andy Levy in studio  Thank God  To help us out here  Hey by the way  Kenny will be on  Cosmo Radio at 910  But you don't have to  Change the dial  Because we're going to  Listen in right here  Oh good  On the Opie and Anthony show 
[02:19:30]  And they're very excited  To meet him  But it was too difficult  For everybody  And realize that  Maybe the  See we got him right there  So when Kenny  Entres the studio  We'll pop them up  And see what that's about  Okay  Great  Let's just get  Through this clip  And then we'll move on  We don't have to play  All the clips right now  From American Idol last night  Well why are you doing this  So why with all the attitude  What's the problem  No there's no problem at all  I think that  I don't know why you guys  There's no problem  You walked in  Very sulky  Quite rude 
[02:20:00]  Very aggressive  And you've got  Very very bad energy  Oh man  You do  I'm still getting that attitude  All right  All right  Yes or no  Andrew no  I'm sorry  Victoria  No  Randy  Wasn't good enough today dog  No  I would have said yes  You're kidding me  You're kidding  He's starting to grow  You know I had a feeling  I had a feeling  You know we started  A little bad  But kind of got to like  Each other  Oh god 
[02:20:30]  You know what  Come on  They were trying to go  For a moment  We talk about that  On the show  Going for that moment  He wasn't that bad  He was a little like  A little ornery  But whatever  Not enough for them  To just  What his attitude  Or his singing  His attitude  He was annoying  You saw his dumb face  Oh really  Yeah  You need the visual too  I thought Simon  Was actually nicer to him  He was just kind of like  Cut it out  Yeah  It's just weird  That there would be  Like a rude guy  Who wants to be  In the music business  Yeah  Isn't that amazing  Yeah 
[02:21:00]  I think it's amazing  That we're just discussing  Stupid American Idol  And tens of thousands  Of people are dead  In Haiti  And we're just like  Yeah  How about that  Simon Cowell  That's America for you  Yeah  We don't care  What do you know  In Haiti  Because we  I mean it's all kind of  Happening as we're  On the air here Andy  Yeah  The last thing I saw  Before I left  My  I was going to say house  And then I realized  I live in a shoebox  Was  I guess  I know right  The UN  Is pledging 
[02:21:30]  Ten million dollars  Which I'm sure  That'll last about  Forty five minutes  Is my guess  I don't know  It looks pretty bad  I guess Port-au-Prince  Got hit really bad  Yeah  They're saying  The worst  And said the worst  The worst earthquake  In two hundred years  In two hundred years  It's like two hundred years  When California  Hit with a seven  Didn't it  Or was it a six something  That big one in California  Yeah but you know  But it's America  We built things  Yeah  They built earthquake proof  Buildings  That's true  Resistant buildings  We built a little stronger  Than what they're building  In Haiti  I would assume  It's pretty much the same  If you've ever driven around 
[02:22:00]  In the Bahamas  And things like that  That kind of  Architecture  The bricks  With the fucking  Corrugated tin roofs  They fall down anyway  The second you just  Shake them a little bit  It's over  Yeah  And of course  In this day and age  You get a lot of Twitters  People are there  Twittering  And sending pictures  You get immediate  Stuff these days  Immediate  I like the future  I like fucking  With Twitter  When he was in  On my  That was fantastic 
[02:22:30]  I somehow  I didn't even talk  About this on the air  When Rush Limbaugh  Had a heart attack  Or whatever he had  Yeah  And was rushed to the hospital  I became an inside source  So easily  I got  My Twitter got pounded  Oh no  Because I just said  That I have inside info  And this and that  But I kept it very vague  And then Andy started  Direct messaging me  Going  Oh dude  I want to comment  So bad on this  I'm loving this  And then he was  Helping me out  A little bit  He's like  Yeah stay there  Say this  I'm like  Alright yeah  I'll go with that  He's like  My source is telling me 
[02:23:00]  At Rush  And I finally  After like the fourth one  I couldn't take it anymore  And I direct messaged him  I'm like  I'm guessing your source  Is sitting next to you  Drunk off of his ass  My source  And he's like  Be quiet  Be quiet  I'm like  Don't ruin this  Because I wasn't sure  If he was with me or not  And I'm watching  Friends of mine  Who are generally  And some of them  Are like serious tweeters  And they tweet news  And they're all retweeting  Everything he's saying  I don't want to say anything  Because I don't want to ruin the bit  I was like  My source is saying  That it doesn't look good 
[02:23:30]  And they went with that  Because you know  You do the hash marks  And you check out  The hot topic  So you can see  Everyone talking about  Rush Limbaugh  And my shit was  No exaggeration  Was being  Re-quoted  And retweeted  Like just crazy  My favorite was  He said something about  My source tells me  That there will be a statement  At like 1am  And then around  1.10  He's like  My source tells me  They're waiting on  Someone to arrive  Someone funny  Right  It's been put off 
[02:24:00]  Because they're waiting  For someone to arrive  That's close to the situation  It's just all this vagary  But  Oh the news conference  Nailed it though  When I said  There will be a statement  Within the hour  That  I mean  That  Set Twitter on fire  It's so easy to do  I mean  People will  Believe anything  That you write down  On there  Especially if it  Gets retweeted  And takes off  Like that  Credentials  Are they going on? 
[02:24:30]  Steve  What are they talking  About credentials?  Steve  What's going on?  Are they going on now?  Yeah  Well someone was supposed  To tell us  Are they going in right now?  Yeah  They walked them in  A few minutes ago  Oh good  Oh that's great  Because we don't have  The audio up  Hey let's talk  Let's talk  Not in private  I don't want to be  Alone with you  That idea is very  Terrifying to me  I'm a little scared  Of you  I'm not going to lie  She might have the cash  You sell the ring  Yeah  She might be ready  I'm starting to think  That it doesn't take  That much cash  To hire you  Think again honey 
[02:25:00]  You still can't  Answer my question  What are your credentials?  What qualifies you?  Alright  Where should I begin?  I'm a retired police officer  Okay  With over 25 years  Of experience  That's good Tay  That's good  That is good  Detective Sergeant  Was my rank  When I retired  That's pretty good  I watched La La and Order  I kind of know  What you're talking about  Aren't they two different things?  I have no idea  Okay  I don't know  It means I was a boss  Of the detectives  Okay  In my squad 
[02:25:30]  Alright  And then I worked  With some very famous  Comedians throughout the years  Oh really?  My most impressive client  Back in the day  Was a man called  Andrew Dice Clay  Oh I know that man  Never heard of him  I was with him 13 years  Back in the day  That must have taken  A lot of protecting  Well no  He's a nice guy  He just knows how to curse good  Have you ever shot a man?  On the job  On the job?  Yeah  Which job?  Police job or this job?  Detective Sergeant 
[02:26:00]  Andrew Dice Clay  He shot Andrew Dice Clay  The statute of limitations is up  But you know  We don't have to get into it  So what do you do for Opie?  Like do you  Whatever I'm told  But do you hang out  With him all day long?  Are you with him at all times?  I'm a facilitator  I'm a fixer  Is it just him?  Or does the other one  Not need any protection?  The other one?  No no  I don't even know  What they look like  In a lineup honestly  So  Really?  Yeah  No  Pull him up on your internet  Kenny do some  Produce  I'm just  I'm in awe  By you  Kenny  Do you go by 
[02:26:30]  Kenny or Kenneth?  Yeah  Why do you go by  Club Soda  Kenny?  I don't get that  Whenever I go down at night  You just drink Club Soda?  I don't know why  You on the wagon?  It's a long story  We have plenty of time  Yeah  It's a talk show  You're the one  You know  Talk  What's Club Soda all about?  Yeah but listen  If I'm going to let you  In my home  To protect me  And pay you  Bundle the money  Are you really sure  You want this guy?  I'm considering it  You know  I mean  I'm a little girl  Just like you said  And I live in a big bad city 
[02:27:00]  And if Opie  Needs protecting  He's a man  Don't you think  A girl needs protecting  As well?  Well  Yeah  Have you ever protected  Female clients?  Why does a man  Need protection?  I mean  Andrew Dice Clay  I get it  But like  Why  Why  Why those two?  Yeah what happened  With Opie  That he needs you  To stand by him  This interview is very one-sided  He doesn't answer any questions  You're not saying much  No no I will  But you know  It's like the interrogation here  It's the barrage  We're good at it  We're very 
[02:27:30]  You're in Cosmo Court now  So  Really?  So why  You nailed it  You nailed it  Should I slow down?  Why do they need protection?  We know why Taylor does  She was accosted just this morning  Yeah I got out of a friggin' cab  Some crazy  Non-homeless guy  Walked right over me  He told me to take my earphones  Out of my ears  Which I didn't do  And I just walked right by him  And he could have jumped  Right on top of me  Right then and there  Right in front of the  McGraw Hill building  And there would have been  Nobody there to protect me  That's sad  It is sad 
[02:28:00]  So if  But that happened to me today  That was the first time  That ever happened  You're so vulnerable  You make me sad  Okay  Why does he need protecting?  He  He  He just needs  Like  Assistance  Do you go home with him too  Or are you just here?  Do you sleep in his bed?  I do things  Yeah  Do you like do his dishes for him?  Are you a butler?  You're a butler  Hey just pay me  I do whatever it takes  Just pay me 
[02:28:30]  Whatever it takes  Okay  Yeah  Okay  Yeah  So like  Your security guard  He can do returns for you  Slash  He can take stuff back to stores  When you buy  That's what I need assistance with  Yeah  Yeah I'll do it  Just pay me  Okay  So how much can I pay you  To be my assistant  Slash bodyguard?  What's the going rate  For a guy who doesn't answer questions?  Well I'm not getting any appearance face  So it's nothing  No  So it's nothing  So he would work for free  Essentially  That fits right into my budget actually  You just take it out and trade

[02:37:00]  What's the worst  Hairy nipple  Like one  Long one  Or kind of like  The whole area  The whole area  Just a little past  Like Peach Fuzzy  It's like when you  Watch a movie  With your dad  It'd be like  Leading over  Just giving his chest  A lick  When you're young  Yeah you're young  And you put your head  On his chest  Yeah I think we all  Do that  Slathering his nipple up  I think we all  Do that  Boyish tongue  On a man's nipple  Thanks for the visual  Jimmy  That's what that's like  I love the fact that

[02:38:30]  What that is  But yeah  They're alright  They're alright  Who's the other one  Who's hotter  The one with the  Fucking beard  Or the other one  The one with the  Hairy nipples  Is probably like  Half a point  Hotter than the other one  Did someone call  For the one  With the beard  Alright  Um  Avatar  You seen it  I saw it  You like  These guys haven't  Seen it yet  I thought it was alright  How was the effects  Well the effects  Were good 
[02:39:00]  I  The 3D thing  Makes the movie  Obviously  The 3D was cool  If it wasn't for the 3D  It would be an average movie  Yeah  I just  I don't see why  I don't know  It was entertaining enough  I have no desire  To ever see it again  It wasn't like  I walked out of there  Thinking  You know  That was fucking amazing  I gotta see that again  The story was stupid  And  Basic  The dialogue  Been told a few times  Yeah  The dialogue was  Idiotic  And  Well when he's trying  To rally  Like his  His people  He didn't get that  Nice Braveheart speech 
[02:39:30]  Yeah  No  There was no  Braveheart speech  We must save our village  There was something stupid  Did he say  This is our  Independence Day  Nothing like that  That was a good speech  Oh shut it  Bill Pullman  Bill Pullman  As the young president  Yeah  Doing  Did a Clint Eastwood  Rip off the entire movie  I belong up there  Exactly  Do ya  Randy Quaid  Also annoyed me  In that movie  That was horrible  He's all drunk  He flies a biplane  And now he knows  How to fly in  Yeah 
[02:40:00]  F-18  It could happen  That was shit  Sure  You could fly a plane  And you've never flown one  I've used Microsoft Flight Simulator  So you can fly  Of course I know  You could make out with Travolta  On the steps of a plane  And see when  Boarding it  You can let him give you  A good smooch-a-rooney  On your fucking lips  They had a dream  But yeah  I don't  I just  I don't  I don't see why  It's  Everyone's raving about it  Billions of dollars  Well because of the technology  We've never seen 3D  Done that well 
[02:40:30]  I mean  Usually when they use  The 3D technology  It kind of takes you  Out of the movies  Did you ever see  The Muppet movie  In Disney  Come on  That's great  Was that in theaters  No  It's just at Disney  That's right  Just like Captain EO  Back in the old days  Remember Captain EO  Michael Jackson's  3D movie  I never saw it  Yeah  It was over at the Epcot  Uh oh  Michael Jackson's  Probably  What's it about  Like a glove or something  Chip  Chip Chipperson 
[02:41:00]  Is the worst character  On this show  The worst character ever  I hate to tell you  But  But Chip is everything  Where's Danny  He fucking missed Chip  He's gonna kill himself  He lives for Chip  I know  Make sure you tell Greg  That Jimmy wants to do Chip  On Red Eye  Make sure that happens  Please  If you only knew  Do it on Red Eye  Please  Dude  If you knew how happy  It would make me  To do Chip on television  Do it  The problem is  I'll ask you about it  In post game tonight  The problem is  It doesn't translate 
[02:41:30]  Because it's not like  An ongoing soap opera  But it translates here  Yeah  It's different  Radio's different  It's like you  You know  You pipe it up  One line here  One line there  You can't do that on TV  It's like  You know  People's like  What is that  Who's this guy  Funny  Smart  Yeah  I understand  Yeah  Don't be afraid  Well  I was asking Andy  About Avatar  Because there's  A story today  People are getting  Depressed  From Avatar  Now why  We're going to find out  Because it's blue  That was me 
[02:42:00]  You didn't even say  I don't like Chip  It's blue  How widespread  Is this phenomenon  Where people are  Feeling depressed  And I guess  The way  In layman's terms  They see this movie  And especially  If they see it in 3D  They're really feeling it  And then  Their world  Is not this  So that's what's  Leading to the depression  In a nutshell  It is indeed  And I think  The depression  Is widespread  Enough  That it is  An actual phenomenon  There were over  A thousand posts  On how to deal 
[02:42:30]  With post-Avatar  Depression  On one of the  Avatar fan forums  And that's just one  Of many fan forums  Where people have  Gotten together  To talk about how  They felt  Very depressed  They felt like  The world was grey  And flat  After waking up  After seeing Avatar  Is the 3D effect  Make it that much greater  Make this world  That much more  Enticing and appealing  Absolutely  I think you put  On these glasses  And James Cameron's  CGI effects  Are so good  That you're actually  Transported  Onto the planet Pandora 
[02:43:00]  So you take off  The glasses  And there's  A disconnect  And that's what's  Making people more  Don't take the glasses  Off  It's great  Just walk around  The city with the  Glasses still on  You know what  When you walk around  I feel like you're  Still in Pandora  Outside a theater  Everything's in 3D  I don't think you  Need to freak out  What do you mean  With the glasses  Without them  With them  As you're walking  Around the streets  Everything's in 3D  Look  This whole room  I actually feel  Like I'm in it 
[02:43:30]  Why doesn't it  Look like 3D though  Why do you need  Glasses for it  To look like 3D  I know it'll look like 3D  This just looks like  Because then you put  The glasses on  And go wow  That 3D is cool  But we're living 3D  And I don't feel  It's anything special  Yeah I'm not looking  Going wow  This is cool  I'm like immersed  In this room  I'm not putting my hand  In front of my face  Trying to touch stuff  Trying to touch things  Wow it's like  It's right here  I had the  When I saw Avatar  I had the weirdest  Experience the whole movie  And I thought it was  An odd directorial choice  For Cameron  There was a large  3D penis  Right in front of my face  But then it turned out  No one else in the theater 
[02:44:00]  Saw it  So I don't really know  What it means  We got kneeling  In the chair  In front of you  Probably just got  His dick out  Were you ever  Were you ever  Depressed after  You saw a movie  Maybe for a moment  Or two  But by the time  Yes jungle fever  But by the time  You're in the lobby  You're done with it  You're like alright  Whatever  We actually did this  Story on Red Eye  A couple weeks ago  Or last week  Or something  Were we that far behind  No it seems to be hitting 
[02:44:30]  Like CNN had a thing  On it today  Whatever  But we did it  A while back  And I was looking  At these forums  Where these people post  And it's just  The saddest thing  You've ever seen  People talking about  How they need  Like an AA  For Avatar  And then  There are these  Same people  In every one of their posts  They say these  Really depressed  Stupid things  But then they put  LOL at the end  Well LOL  Fix anything  Yeah  It sure does  Unless you're really old  It means lying on the linoleum 
[02:45:00]  Cool  One shoe  One shoe  Still on the rug  Yeah  Could you say  Could you say  Askew  Askew  That's my favorite word  When it comes to  A little shoe  Askew  A lot of people  Have talked about this  With video gaming too  That role playing games  Like EverQuest  And World of Warcraft  They get so into it  And they are  A mighty character  And they have powers  And everything  And then they unplug 
[02:45:30]  And they're just  You know  Fat kids in their basement  Listen to mom  Do you know  That happened to me  When I was playing Monopoly  I got to be the car  And I used to  Walk around in a box shape  And yell  Vroom  And want people to  Hand me $200  Occasionally  I'm like look  You have to go back  To Los Angeles  I'm over tired  You're just  You're taking this  Leno thing hard  I couldn't sleep  On the plane  Oh I'm so happy  Dude props  Props to Jimmy Kimmel  By the way  Dressed up like Leno 
[02:46:00]  And did his monologue  That's for us  As Leno  And pulled it off  And then what did he do  I think he interviewed  Chevy Chase last night  As Conan O'Brien  I think  I think he switched it up  A little bit  Funny  Fucking  What a great angle  On that  He interviewed Chevy Chase  Was Chevy Chase at all  Funny or entertaining  I don't know  Cause he's got that  New show right  Community  Yeah community  And people say  Yeah people say  It's good  And he's good in it  He is good in it 
[02:46:30]  I watch  Believe it or not  He's really good in it  But you just hear  He's one of those  Just insufferable pricks  Yeah  Yeah  Like a bitter  Bitter man  I mean he's turning that around  With this community  People are really digging him  Really  Yeah it's not a bad show  Now his late night talk show  Uh worth bomb ever  That was great  Well it's between him  And Magic Johnson right  Didn't Magic Johnson have one  I think Magic lasted longer  Magic Johnson cannot speak  Which is 
[02:47:00]  You know for a talk show  I think you need  To be able to speak  And he  He just can't do it  Yeah  All the guests too  Wanting to sit at least  25 feet away  Didn't help  Oh cause he had age  Yeah  Jesus  Get it  They were all holding up  Fucking plastic shields  Like they were going to do  A fucking  A cell removal  Well they just didn't know  They just didn't know  What that was about yet  They passed out dental dams  Just to talk with 
[02:47:30]  Yeah  Half the audience  Thought they were at a  Gallagher show  With all the tarping  Every time he coughed  The audience would run out  Screaming  Right  There was not as much  Known back then  It was a little rough  It was a little  Tough to laugh  Thinking that you might  Be infected with something  That will kill you  In ten years  People were very ignorant  They have no idea  Now we're much more educated  You think Magic Johnson  Wouldn't be insulted  If they had like  The Gallagher tarping  As he walked out  Yeah  Over the first row  Of the first couple rows  Well when people  Would shake hands 
[02:48:00]  Then he'd be offended  Because they'd come out  Wearing a suit  And like a space suit glove  On their handshake hand  On their handshake hand  Whatever hand that may be  Righty or southpaw  You are sleepy  It'll depend  If Ron Giddy came out  He would have shaken lefty  He said all depend  It'll depend  He said all depend  I'm fucking  I was watching DirecTV  On the flight last night  Man I'm fucking tired  Yeah  When you try to sleep  Dude I did  I just couldn't  I can never sleep on the plane 
[02:48:30]  Why  Can't do it man  It's great  It's like a time machine  I can't sleep  It's for me  In real time  I'm going to plummet  To my death  I want to be awake for it  Hey this guy  Got depressed after  Well he'll tell you  Let's go to Brian  Brian  Right home  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  No I was just  You know  I was reading an article  About Avatar Depression  And you guys  Were talking about  Movies like that  Leaving Las Vegas  And Nicolas Cage  And Elizabeth Shue  I mean  By the end of that movie

[03:04:00]  Or anything  It's just  His fans came down  And stuck with him  Just like Jay's people  Came and watched him  It's just not the numbers  I would love to see  The numbers for Leno  At 10 o'clock  Now that this  Controversy hit  The numbers  Gotta be really  Really strong  Jim do you blame  Yourself for  Any of this  If you only knew  How anything  I attach itself to  Dies on the vine  That's what  Ant and I were saying  We're like  The luck Jimmy has  It's unfuckabliable  He's involved with  Stuff that really  Should be taken off  And if for some reason  Or not they don't 
[03:04:30]  They're like heartworm  I fucking  That lucky Louie  On HBO  There was no reason  Why they  Picked up another season  No reason  The fucking  Tough Crown thing  Was a fine show  Two years  Oh I'm glad  You're a regular  On Red Eye Jimmy  I know  Have fun with that Andy  Yeah  I really am the  Kiss of death  I don't mean to be  I just show up  And have fun next week  But Jay loves you  You'll be part of  The Tonight Show now  I hope so  I hope  Again I know  What his format  Is going to be 
[03:05:00]  But I certainly hope so  I think  I would fucking hate  Not going out there  It's fun man  Nah  Nah you got a spot now  Absolutely  I hope so  It depends on what they have  What they do at the show  If it's the old format  Right  There might be some spots  Here and there  Well they would have to go  Mostly old format  Because that's what  Was number one with Jay  Yeah  They'd be crazy  That's stupid  And wreck that formula too  No they wouldn't  You know  Executives  Got to just leave shit alone  I know  Hire talented people  And then you just  Make believe you're doing  Something in your office 
[03:05:30]  That's your job  Then you don't feel important  Yeah  You've got to make  Big decisions  You see the new  Speaking of what  You see the new  Fucking coat hook man  That took over a month  That's a nice job  Damn  Nice right  Wow  Want to hang your coat over there  I wish I would have thought of it  That's a good  That's a good second hanger  For a derby  Yeah  Bring a derby in tomorrow  By the way my manager  Is a fuck  He's coming in Friday  We have to have Jonathan on  I had dinner with him last night  He's a psychopath  He told me  He asked his assistant  Jean  Who's like 
[03:06:00]  She's a maniac  She just talks like  She doesn't have any emotion  And he goes  Who would you rather  Go on a blind date with  Amon Gert  Or Paul Pott  Oh my god  What a selection  I just love him so much  And she's like  They're both terrible  I don't want to answer  Can you refresh my memory  On those two people  Amon Gert  Those two horrendous human beings  Ralph Fiennes played him  In Schindler's List  He was a horrible Nazi  And Paul Pott  Committed genocide in Cambodia  I think you'd have a better  Chance of living  With Paul Pott  Well he said  That eventually 
[03:06:30]  She decided  He said that he tried  To sell Paul Pott  A little bit more  He goes  He'd probably  He would probably  Just want to sit there  And look at your straight hair  And she's like  Yeah you're probably right  And then she did decide  Ultimately on Paul Pott  Yeah we haven't talked  About it in a while  Have you figured it out  Is it a ball bag  Or is it his cock  My manager has a giant  Anomaly in the front  Of his pants  And we all stare  We all stare at him  We try to figure out  What's going on there  Yeah I don't know  What it is  And he doesn't even realize  That he's just got this  Big mess of something  In front of his pants  Me and Florentine  Have asked him  What has he said 
[03:07:00]  Yeah he's just  Uncomfortable  Steve from Bay Show  Wants to clear something up  A man got  Girth  He was  Girth  Girth  Wasn't a terrible Nazi  He was very good at it  Yes he was a good Nazi  Yes  What was the line  Jonathan kept quoting  Last night  When I'm walking  Through the Warsaw ghetto  And the one guy  Was smart  And he started  Picking up bags  I was told to  Oh yeah yeah yeah  And he said  Clear the way  Click little clicking  Polish soldier  Was that the line  He was so good in that man  Hey Jimmy 
[03:07:30]  Before I ban a hater  Would you take on  This question please  Sure  This is Joe from New York City  Probably a fake name  I'm sure  Jay Leno fucking sucks  Tell little Jimmy  To jump ship  I don't know what I'm going to say  It's just a guy who's  I think Jay Leno's record  Speaks for itself  I don't care if a guy  It was written by Conan  Huh  It was written by Conan  Yes  Oh come on C-O-B  We know who you are  Jay Leno had  Huge success  With the Tonight Show  But he  Leno sucks  Just silly  Everyone knew 
[03:08:00]  Going into the  10 o'clock time slot  That was going to be  A rough one  Doesn't anybody  Wonder why nobody's  And again  Why is nobody  This is how biased  They're not attacking  Conan at all  Who's losing to Letterman  But they're attacking Jay  And he had to switch  It's amazing to me  How people's criticism  It was so weird  Yeah  It started with him  Getting screwed over  Yeah  But whatever  I mean you know  He'll go back  And Conan  Whatever he does  Will make millions  Conan's going to Fox  It's obvious  Because with that statement  Yesterday  He's got something going on  He's got the biggest balls 
[03:08:30]  With that statement  After last night's show  After the shit  He was giving NBC  I don't see how they can  Keep him on the air  For the rest of the  I mean I think  After this week  You know what  They've got to start  Running where you're on  You know what though Andy  You're right  Because we've been in situations  Where we knew  We were going to get fired  And they're like  Oh my god  We've got to get rid of him immediately  Yeah  Why?  Everyone's going to want to see  What Conan has to say  I mean he's really  Right at trashing the network  And I just don't think  A guy is using your airway  Well I think it damages your brand  And it wasn't even in a way  Like when Letterman does it 
[03:09:00]  It's kind of in a funny way  Right  It's beyond that now  Now he's like  Now he's like  Saying things like  Yeah  Nice people  Yeah  No exactly  Like a couple of nights ago  It was just  It was funny  Oh he did it on the airy trash  It was funny last night too  But it's getting  I mean it is now  Crossed over  I love that shit  Straight old mean territory  I love that shit  Oh it's fantastic  It's getting uglier and uglier  Yeah  Do we have audio  I didn't see it  Yeah we can play it again  I've actually  Conan I've never met  But he seemed like  He'd be a fucking  I don't know why  I think I'd like him  Yeah  Yeah he's like  Self-deprecating 
[03:09:30]  He's going to never  Acknowledge this show  Unfortunately  He was bashing NBC  Could you bring that audio back  Why would they take it  Did he put a donut on it  Maybe it's over here  That was a plate  He put a donut  Just carrying it around  Eating it whole daintily  Yeah where'd it go  Didn't get him  Roll itself out of here  Chip shut the fuck up  Danny  Danny laughs at Chip  Danny fucking  Here's the thing  As far as Danny is concerned  Chip is the sun  And the moon  And the stars  Danny adores Chip 
[03:10:00]  In the Latin sense  Of the word  Adorare  I am totally crushing  On Lyle Chipperson  I know you are  His middle name is  Delmar by the way  Lyle Delmar Chipperson  Yeah it's a weird name  I muttered  We hit a guard there  He's a black fella  Nice guy named Delmar  I don't know why  My father hated him  My father sold encyclopedias  Danny fucking  Digs Chip  In a big old way  Yeah  We have the audio  Yeah we got  Conan Trashing  NBC and everybody  During his  Yeah just listen  How this gets like 
[03:10:30]  Oh Jesus Jimmy  Listen how it  It's not  Really fun  Alright good  He's really kind of  Twisting the spoon  I love real venom man  I know  It's great  The difference though  He sounded deeply depressed  The night before  And now he's just like  He's rocking  I heard he broken in tears  When he was reading  A statement to his staff  Because he cried  He said  Good explanation  Asshole  Please I may not have  That much time  Please  You're using valuable time here 
[03:11:00]  Yay  And he's gone  Where'd he go  I don't know  They took him away  Yes we took him away  Thank you for that  Hello there  My name is Conan O'Brien  And I may soon be available  For children's parties  So  I made a peacock  Yeah  No no seriously 
[03:11:30]  Welcome to NBC  Where our new slogan is  No longer just  Screwing up prime time  Huh  No it's a crazy day  Crazy day  I've been giving  This whole situation  It really has been  Crazy here Andy  It's been  It's been the most fun  I've ever had  In a showbiz scandal  Wow  Yeah  It's fun  And I've been giving  This situation  A lot of thought  You know  This is a true story  When I was a little boy  I remember watching  The Tonight Show  With Johnny Carson  And thinking  Someday 
[03:12:00]  I'm going to host that show  For seven months  I knew that was  The perfect amount of time  What else is going on  NBC says  That they are planning  To have the late night  Situation worked out  Before the winter  Olympics start  As they say  Yeah  And trust me  When NBC says something  You can take that  To the bank  Yeah  They just 
[03:12:30]  They're good people  They're very good people  A lot going on  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid is in the news  He's still under fire  For remarks he made  About President Obama's  Blackness  You reading about that?  Yeah  Bad  Yeah  Sources say Reid  Could face congressional censure  Or even worse  Be promised  The Tonight Show  At 1130  That's not good  I wouldn't wish that  On anyone 
[03:13:00]  There is  That was very funny  But you can tell  That passes by  Just let's make fun  Of the old network  And behind the scenes  They'll go  Hey that was fun  And then he was even  Later in the show  He had Tom Brokaw  And he was still  Going at it  Every time  Brokaw kept bringing up  NBC  And Conan  Was fine  Like why do you keep  Stop saying NBC  Stop saying NBC  I'm trying to  I'm trying to have  A good time here  Oh shit  And it was just going 
[03:13:30]  It was through the whole show  It was unreal  He's uh  But he's in a  NBC  He's in a weird spot  Because if you yank him  It looks bad  Uh like all of a sudden  You're silencing the guy  For criticizing  Like it's  It already looks hard  I'm saying they're in a bad spot  They're in a bad fucking spot  I just think  They've got to reach  Some kind of an agreement  They have to reach  Some kind of an agreement  Where after this week  It's going to be a rerun  Here's what they are  They're peshy  Sitting on the steps  They're peshy  Talking to Frank Vincent  Right now  Oh shit  They're in a bad fucking spot  Frankie  I fucked up  I fucked up  With this 1130 spot 
[03:14:00]  Bam  They'll start  A new Monday  Conan will be done  By Monday  Yeah I think so  I think you're right  Andy  Andy from Ohio  Writes  Jesus  Jay never got screwed  Out of his position  He fucking gave NBC  The timeline  For when he was  Leaving the show  No no no  Whoa whoa  Jay is the asshole  In this situation  Sorry Jimmy  Jay did not give him  The timeline  For when he was  In the show  That was what  They said  They wanted to  Give it to Conan  That was not  Jay's decision  That was the network  Basically Conan 
[03:14:30]  Was going to leave  The network  And this is to  The best of my knowledge  They didn't want  Conan to leave  The network  And compete  So they said  Look  It was 2004  In 2009  We'll give you  The tonight show  And if we don't  Give you the tonight show  You can leave  With 40 million  Extra dollars  I believe that was  The deal  So Leno  Didn't want to leave  So the guy  Who just said that  I hate to tell you  You're completely  Leno  Loved hosting  The tonight show  And he didn't  Bitch about it  He stayed number one  The problem was  They did not 
[03:15:00]  Anticipate him  Still being  A beast  An unbeatable  Beast  At 1130  They gambled  They thought  Alright  In five years  I think Leno  Leno's run  Will be over  And we'll move  Conan nicely  And that's that  So for the people  Who think that  Jay just flip flopped  On a decision  Not true  Again  He's a company man  He didn't bitch  About the company  He did what they said  What they wanted him to do  And then the time came  And he was still number one  And they realized  Okay 
[03:15:30]  Now we have to deal  With him across the street  So now Conan  Has to face Letterman  And the beast  Who's number one  We can't lose Leno  I heard he agreed to leave  Oh you're right  So he  So they promised him  Prime time  And I've said  From day one  And it's a theory  I would never have  Asked Jay about it  It was a theory  That I think  Jay wanted to stay  At NBC  A because he didn't  Want to  He said he didn't  Want to leave  With bitterness  And B  It's like he knew  That he had to know  That if things  Didn't work with Conan  He's still there 
[03:16:00]  For the Tonight Show  He had to know that  Yeah  But don't tell me  Leno couldn't have  Went to fucking ABC  And made a shitload of money  He would have got  Whatever he wanted  At another network  The number one show  Leaving  He would have gotten  Whatever he wanted  So that guy  You're wrong  And a lot of people  Think that  Wrong  Yeah  Leno's getting a rap  He did not flip flop  He never wanted to leave  They forced him out  As number one  Horrendous decision  I blame it all  On stupid management  Because I mean  I've seen  I've seen management  Before  Pleasantry  Pleasantry 
[03:16:30]  I'm not going to  Name anyone specific  Or even a company  Specifically  By the way  Congratulations to Comcast  For stepping in  And taking over this mess  Yeah you see that  You've got to be  Really excited  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That's nice  You're missing  The Food Network  Or Home and Garden  Television  Do you have that cable  No I have  Time Warner  Oh Time Warner  I have cable vision  And  Did you even notice  They're gone  No  But  The first time I ever  Saw Bobby Flay  In my life  Is now on these

[03:17:30]  Shit  That was a good channel  Oh Chip  I don't even know  If I ever came across that  I don't know  Even as a goof  I don't know  Not one show  The food  I've never seen that  What what  What are those  Stupid cake building shows  Did you watch  The Food Network  I got song  One time  I stopped biting  The knobs  And stuff  You know  I can't  I don't know  What to do with Chip  I don't know

[03:19:00]  And they fucking hung up  But they're saying  That you're exactly right  Me?  Yes  I know  I know  Once I got a callback  This NBC mole  I'm not bullshitting  I remember when that happened  I'm a little nervous though  And someone just texted me  A friend  She goes  Don't you feel bad  For Conan  I really do  Of course I do  Yeah he's getting screwed now  He's got some  You know like  Mike Sweeney  He's a brilliant writer  Like I know some of the guys  On his staff  It's not like  Not liking Conan  It's simply  I felt worse for Jay  His remaining number one  For 16 years  And then being kicked out  It's unheard of 
[03:19:30]  Well you'd always feel worse  For Jay  Yeah I would  Because I'm very biased  But he's good to comedians  Does this go all the way  Back to Letterman  Being screwed  To begin this whole thing  Did Letterman get screwed though  Or did they think  That Leno would just do better  In that spot  I don't know  I mean Letterman put in  The time though  Yeah that's true  It seemed like he  Deserved least a shot at it  It was owed to him  Yeah  I don't know why  They gave it to Jay  Maybe they just felt  He would do better  They just don't know  What they're doing  With that shit huh  Well they did though  Because he was number one  For all those years  That's true  I guess you're right 
[03:20:00]  They made the right move  Yeah  You know Jay  Takes the spot  And does okay with it  Got Jay a lot of  Fucking cars  That guy  He drives  All he does  Is drive cars  It's like  Well you can't know  If he's backing up  And talking on the phone  Or whatever he's doing  So he's zipping around  Right  I can't stand it  I just can't  Stand it  NBC Mole is back  NBC Mole  Oh let's see  Spy report  Spy report

[03:26:30]  Having apples in their hineys  Let's see if you're right  And you'll see  That coming in season three  Yes  Oh okay  Season three  Season three  The orchard  Wow  Oh fuck you're right  Apples in their hineys  I was wondering  Yeah  And I said no  I would not like to change anything  Because I still  Oh they suggest bananas or oranges  And she's adamant  That it must be apples  Holy shit we got a new bit  I'm not going to change a thing about that  And yes I am keeping 
[03:27:00]  Apples in my ass  And I'm going to go from three to four  Whether the big brass likes it or not  Fergie will always be the Duchess of York  Fabulous  Good  Because we want you to keep being the county  Yes  Before I let you go  I have one more thing  And it's actually  I have a bone to pick with you  Oh no  Oh no  She's going to say  I heard you can clench your cheeks  And make sauce  True or false  True or false  Can you make applesauce  By clenching your butt cheeks  I'm already going to give you it out beforehand  But  I'm pretty certain you don't remember 
[03:27:30]  But we do because we are of course fans of the show  Right  We the two of us  The Judgment Twins  We took over Fashion Week this fall  Yes  And we ran into Kelly at a fashion show  And you happened to be with her  Yes  Who the fuck is listening to that  I don't know who this lady is  Cosmo fans  I don't know  We were standing right there  Well we kind of  I was going to answer  We kind of like gave you  We kind of gave you like a  Like a quick wave  Because we were talking with her  Was I filming?  Was I shooting for the show?  You were  And I thought either she has no idea who we are  And so 
[03:28:00]  Oh my god  When she raises her voice  It's like listening to the babe  At the end of his life  That fucking voice is going to get real bad real quick  Can I tell you what I hear  It's all cute now  This is what my brain is  Wait until she sounds like Lucille Ball  In fucking  The one where she was with Mr. Mooney in the bank  It wasn't like  Eww  Anymore  It was  Oh no  This is what I hear  Yeah  Instead of that babble  Oh no 
[03:28:30]  Yes  Oh, my God. 
[03:29:00]  He says, what could that thing be saying?  What could that, I'd like to just sit that animal down and go, what are you doing?  What could you possibly be talking about?  How tough is it's life that it makes a noise like that?  But who's actually getting something out of that message?  Why couldn't you do that for two seconds?  It's unnecessary.  It's a long sentence.  It's endless.  Something to say.  It didn't.  It was a run-on sentence. 
[03:29:30]  No punctuation?  No, one long word.  I'm trying to decipher what a fucking rooster was saying.  This is really bad.  Yeah, I'm tired.  What's the Balls Deep thing?  We could end with Balls Deep, Danny.  It's a song slash video that's been going around.  From the Cleveland show?  Yeah, it premiered on the Cleveland show on Sunday.  Are you a fan of the Cleveland show?  Not so much, man.  I'm a family guy guy.  Why do they have to do this?  Out of all the characters to pick to spin off, why him?  I don't know.  I thought Quagmire was the way to go. 
[03:30:00]  Quagmire was the obvious choice.  Is Cleveland black?  Yeah.  Try to get more black viewers.  How many for the family guy?  Oh, stop.  You're racist.  But they have a lot of great characters on the show, and they picked the dullest one  to do a spin off with.  And I haven't been into it.  I watched the first episode, and then I was just like, wow, that was it.  I didn't even try.  I tried the first episode.  A Quagmire show, I would try.  Yeah, that was it.  But this is going around.  I was making the rounds today, so I figured.  Or the old pedo guy.  Have a fucking spin off with him.  I can't stand that character.  With the whistle.  Oh, man. 
[03:30:30]  I love it.  I hate it.  What's going on in my past?  And I hate that.  Looks like six more weeks from later.  Great.  You look pretty good, Dan.  He's my favorite.  He's the best.  He rules.  Him and, what's his name?  Travis helped me out.  The performance artist.  Bruce, the performance artist.  Bruce is the best.  Yeah, he is definitely the best.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, we'd think it was the real people.  I said something really stupid one time, and Colin said to me, 
[03:31:00]  All right, goodfellas girlfriend.  I knew exactly what he meant.  Perfect.  I just made some asinine statement.  Like, that guy's funny.  His jokes are good.  You know, it was like one of those.  Oh, Colin is an ass.  Yeah, he really is a piece of shit.  What is balls deep so we can get fucking...  Yeah, all right.  Why don't we do this?  So we got to...  I know what that is.  What?  That's what happens when there's a girl laying on her back,  and you're not paying attention when your pogo's sticking. 
[03:31:30]  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  I guess I should have said it like this.  Yeah, say it like that.  All right, balls deep.  Balls deep from the Cleveland show.  Thank you, Andy, from Red Eye.  Thanks for having me.  And on Twitter, it's just...  Andy Levy.  That's right, Andy Levy on Twitter.  He's a good one to follow.  Jimmy's going to be on Red Eye tonight,  so make sure you check that out.  And this very sexy Essie Cup, she's fantastic.  Yeah, she's great.

I've never gotten less vibes from a person.  Really?  I get more vibes off Gutfeld.  Where is Greg today?  Too big to do the show, I guess.  Yeah, that's basically it.  I figured as much.  No, I think he was going to be on Hannity tonight or something, 
[03:32:30]  so he didn't want to...  Oh, my God.  So what's he doing?  Having his...  But now he's not on Hannity.  They ended up moving it, but...  Good.  Ah, Jeff got stepped on.  What's he having?  His britches resized or something,  because he's all big for him right now or something?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What? </pre>
