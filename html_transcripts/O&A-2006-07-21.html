<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and offensive humor, referring to themselves and their crew with insulting nicknames like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts."  They briefly touched on the conflict in Lebanon, prompting a sarcastic exchange with Steve, identified as Lebanese.  A listener, Doug from Boston, suggested a mud flap design featuring the show's logo, leading to a frustrated response from the hosts.  A significant portion of the show focused on their declining radio ratings, specifically their loss to "Mantown," a show they described as having a "gay bit," blaming their poor performance in Boston on a previous, incompetent host.  They then promoted their upcoming "Traveling Virus" tour, including a "petting zoo" for their most dedicated (and, in their words, "pest-like") fans.  A listener contributed a crudely humorous theme song for Mantown.

Anthony recounted a negative experience at a Brooklyn movie theater involving a confrontation with another moviegoer, which devolved into a discussion about the dangers of verbal disputes, laced with offensive racial slurs.  The show then reviewed the overwhelmingly negative critical response to M. Night Shyamalan's "Lady in the Water," with Anthony sharing a story about a child being upset by the film, comparing it to his own childhood experience vomiting during "Bonnie and Clyde," prompting a discussion about his difficult childhood and parents' divorce.

The hosts then launched into a vehement defense against a Roger Friedman article on FoxNews.com criticizing their interview with Kevin Smith and Joel Siegel about *Clerks 2*, calling Friedman numerous offensive names, including "dope," "schmuck," and "faggot," and expressing their desire for a confrontation.  They highlighted that the interview was primarily a debate between Smith and Siegel, not an attack on Siegel by Opie and Anthony.  They mentioned the interview segment aired on CNN and would be on E! News, further discussing *Clerks 2*, including its controversial donkey scene and their own experiences walking out of bad movies.  They also noted that Kevin Smith and some of the *Clerks 2* cast were in the studio.  They recounted a previous instance of Friedman's inaccurate reporting concerning *The Passion of the Christ*.

A substantial portion of the show mocked a deaf reporter, Karen Meyer from ABC 7 Chicago, playing clips of her reports and making fun of her speech, discussing what they perceived as the exploitative nature of her assignments.  The show featured calls from listeners, many older than the 12-year-old age Friedman attributed to their audience.  A call from Donald Trump discussed the upcoming Miss Universe pageant, criticizing the Miss America pageant for political correctness, expressing his preference for smaller swimsuits and higher heels, and joking about the possibility of mud wrestling at the Miss Universe pageant.  Trump also discussed his golf course and his vision for rebuilding the World Trade Center. The hosts briefly mentioned an upcoming live show and previewed a Logo channel show called Noah's Ark, featuring four black gay men.  This Trump call was followed by a discussion with Dante and Randall, actors from *Clerks 2*, focusing on the film's vulgarity, including its controversial scenes, and their experiences during the press tour.  Dr. Ian Smith from *Celebrity Fit Club* was in studio, offering commentary on various celebrities, including Bon Jovi and Heather Mills, and contributing to discussions about a planned topless scene with Dakota Fanning.  A listener claiming to be a nurse and legal secretary called in, intending to shoot at a target range topless as a stunt for the show, prompting more off-color jokes. The show concluded with an outside segment showing the hosts with Dante and Randall signing autographs, interacting with a homeless man they nicknamed "Frederick Douglass," and commenting on the challenges of signing autographs and dealing with fans.

A subsequent segment included a sexually suggestive and vulgar phone call with Trina, a self-described hunter who detailed her firearm collection and fantasized about shooting Britney Spears. The hosts engaged in highly inappropriate questioning about her body and sexual activity, followed by a game of “Guess What’s in My Pants.” Akil called in from New Orleans, offering commentary on the segment and engaging in unrelated conversations, referencing Hurricane Katrina and the Israel-Lebanon conflict.  Brian and Jeff (Dante and Randall from *Clerks*) were interviewed, discussing their high school experiences, working in a video store, and acting challenges.  Donald Faison called in to promote *The Groomsmen*, discussing his career, the film's plot, and a humorous anecdote involving Jay Moore. The segment concluded with further discussion of a previous "monkey playing poker" news segment and more jokes at Faison's expense.

A final segment featured another in-studio discussion about *Clerks II* with Dante and Randall, interspersed with off-topic conversations, including a bizarre poker game with a child named Mikey, sponsored by PokerShare.com.  The conversation was filled with vulgar and offensive jokes, sexually explicit comments, and homophobic slurs, alongside a story about a potty-training doll.  Several callers phoned in, one reviewing *Clerks II*, another complaining about the hosts' behavior, and others engaging in vulgar conversations.  A caller described a fish with human-like teeth, prompting further inappropriate jokes.  A humorous news report about a leprechaun sighting in Alabama was played and discussed.  The hosts and Steve critiqued a new radio promo featuring Bronx Johnny and Wild Bill, again punctuated with vulgar humor.  The segment ended with a female caller making overtly sexual comments toward Jimmy, a member of the show's staff.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Right off!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow, we're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting. 
[00:00:30]  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boob that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, don't go through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad. 
[00:01:00]  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  Laughing Lebanese.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Why is Steve laughing so hard in that when his people are dying over in Lebanon? 
[00:01:30]  Don't, don't.  Hezbollah.  I'm part of the Hezbollah.  Just leave Israel to me.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opian Anthony show.  Steve, what do you think about Lebanon and everything that's going on over there with your people since you're Lebanese?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I see the Pal Talk cameras are being set up. 
[00:02:00]  We're broadcasting the ONA virus spreading across America.  Video, audio, dancing lessons, acting lessons.  Video, audio, mud flaps.  Mud flaps.  Enough about the mud flaps.  Holy Jesus, this Doug from Boston.  I'm a fan of the show, I gather, but he wants to make mud flaps.  Wow, mud flaps for the truckers.  Sounds like a great idea.  That's fine.  What am I, in charge of marketing? 
[00:02:30]  You jack off?  Make your goddamn mud flaps.  I told you, make your mud flaps.  I guess whoever he spoke to, who he should have continued speaking to, had a problem with the logos, you know, either an XM logo being on it, you know, sanctioning it.  Put a goddamn wow on there.  Put Opian Anthony wow on mud flaps and slap them on trucks if you want to sell them, whatever you want to do.  I don't care.  I don't want any money. 
[00:03:00]  I don't get it.  Make your, your, your eating mud flaps.  He's emailing everybody, right?  But let me tell you something.  Listen, I don't want to hear one more thing about a mud flap.  I don't want to hear one more word from Doug from Boston about a goddamn mud flap.  Make them, make them, just make the damn thing.  Enough.  Every day.  Email, MySpace, anything.  Don't worry. 
[00:03:30]  Etched in my windshield when I go to the parking garage.  Don't worry.  XM or CBS Radio, they're not going to come after you because you're making illegal.  You don't worry.  It's not Gene Simmons working here.  Yeah.  Make your mud flaps.  Were those kiss mud flaps?  I'm going to have to come after you.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't worry about it.  There.  Enough.  Speaking of Boston, the ratings came out yesterday.  Yes.  And we're moving forward.  It's a little forward movement.  And unfortunately, thanks to you guys in Boston, I have to admit, we have to admit, that we're 
[00:04:00]  still losing to Mantown.  Mantown.  Mantown is still beating the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for nothing, Boston.  Well, I believe when...  A show with a gay bit is beating us.  Mantown.  Mantown is still beating us, although we're chipping away.  Oh, that's just horrific.  Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.  If only we'd have started a month earlier and didn't have that albatross around our neck, 
[00:04:30]  the waste product that was the ratings of David Lee Roth in that first month, we still  have that.  Picture it this way.  I'm going to put it in terms people can understand.  You're a very smart person.  You're in school.  You have three tests that that is what your grade is going to be by the end of the year.  You get A's on two of your tests. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  The last person, the last test that is taken isn't taken by you.  It's taken by a blithering retard mongoloid.  A waterhead.  Waterhead Down Syndrome child takes the final test, and that grade is averaged into your two  A's.  And now your final grade stinks because he got a 10 instead of your 100.  He got F. 
[00:05:30]  Mr. Hand was handing him out.  F.  F.  That's what we're dealing with.  Two of our tests are good.  One was done by a mongoloid.  And we have to deal with that for another month.  For another month.  But then we get to take our last test, and the mongoloids test gets ripped up and thrown  out of the average.  So we're still losing to Mantown.  Mantown.  Thanks to the waterhead that had the radio show before us.  Thanks.  Thanks. 
[00:06:00]  Thanks a lot.  It's embarrassing that we have to tell our listeners we're losing to Mantown still.  Make no mistake, though.  We're moving up in the ratings.  Not as good as Philly.  Philly was amazing the other day.  Boston was good.  We'll call it just good.  I think we're in the top five in all the demos we need to be in.  Philly gave us second place.  Yep.  New York gave us second place.  Oh, look.  The slogans are already coming in.  Yeah.  Mantown.  We're always on top.  Damn. 
[00:06:30]  That was funny.  I should give credit where credit is, too.  Yeah.  Who was that?  RTA Doyle.  All right.  Well, they're getting a little nervous over there, though, because they're starting to  slip.  They're starting to slip in the ratings, and it's just a matter of time.  But we thought we'd have really good news for our fine listeners in Boston.  We have okay news.  We have good news.  We have news.  After a couple of months.  A little frustrating, actually. 
[00:07:00]  But we move on.  Yeah, because we want to just, like, sweep up immediately.  That's what we do.  And then when it doesn't happen, we're like, ah.  Yeah, stupid us.  We want to set the radio world on fire after 60 days.  Yeah.  In 60 days.  I know.  We're kind of dumb.  It just doesn't work that way at all.  But it's working in the other markets, you know?  It's working nicely.  And then we were just hoping.  Well, people are going to be confused here and think that we sucked really bad in Boston.  We didn't.  No, no.  We just wanted it to be a lot better than it was. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, we did very well.  We just wanted it to really, you know, kick ass and at least beat the man town.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan in Boston today.  What's up, Dan?  What's up, Opie?  What's up, Anthony?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, I heard you guys talking last week about the ticket sales for the traveling virus out in  Boston being low.  Yeah.  I just picked up 10 pairs and I'm going to be handing them out to all my friends to support  the show.  Oh, awesome.  Yeah.  I mean, the traveling virus, it's going to be great.  August 5th, Worcester, DCU Center. 
[00:08:00]  We got Bob Saget, Jim Norton, Bob Kelly, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, Tracy  Morgan, Ralphie May.  We added the dunking booth clown that just, you know, berates everybody.  He's very good at berating people and making a lot of noise.  We're talking about the O&A Village.  Uh, that's coming together nicely.  We got some ideas for that.  We may have like, uh, the pal talk cameras at the event.  Uh, we might give a booth.  Are you ready for this?  Here we go.  Here we go.  This is going to start some, uh, some chatter, some chatter on the internet. 
[00:08:30]  Pay attention.  They're going to start chattering on all the, uh, the fan sites.  Yep.  We are going to give the pests their own booth at the O&A Traveling Virus.  That's right.  We're going to have this thing called the O&A Village.  Yep.  It's going to be full of freaks and, uh, events.  It's going to have hot girls.  A dunking booth.  A, uh, uh, uh, uh, maybe an open mic area.  We don't know.  Petting zoo.  Petting zoo.  Yeah, we're going to have a petting zoo as well. 
[00:09:00]  Yes.  Not your run-of-the-mill petting zoo.  No, we're going to get some of the, uh, the Uber, the Uber fans that you know and love.  Yeah.  And we're going to corral them in a petting zoo.  A petting zoo for photo ops and feeding.  That's right.  Because they all look like they can eat a lot.  That's right.  Like, Pat Fuminaki is going to be perfect for this.  Yeah.  We're going to corral them into a pen.  There's going to be hay on the ground.  And you can pet them and take pictures with them.  Yeah.  But watch out.  They bite.  Yeah, because the hang is going to be in the ONA village before the actual show starts. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  So people are going to be just, you know, mingling and doing whatever.  There's going to be a lot of things, uh, to do there.  And one of them will be to go to the petting zoo, uh, petting zoo, the ONA petting zoo.  Mm-hmm.  And get your pictures with Pat Fuminaki and Starker Patty and, and, uh, and others to be, uh, to be named.  And we're going to have little, like, little feeding things where you throw your little quarter in  and get little feeding things.  And you get, like, like sunflower seeds and you can throw it at them.  Yeah.  Or M&Ms, whatever.  And then the other thing, yes.  Because we're.  The pests.  We're setting up all sorts of booths. 
[00:10:00]  We're going to have a pal talk, uh, booth or, or whatever.  Maybe that'll be part of the pest booth.  But yes, to the ONA pests that do a lot of great things for our show, you guys will have  your own booth at the, uh, ONA Traveling Virus.  We found them to be very creative over the years.  And, uh, what they can do, uh, is take this booth and do what they want with it.  Uh, what they think would be entertaining, representative of the show and the pests.  And, uh, now begin your, uh, your, uh, little speculation and banter on the websites of what 
[00:10:30]  you, what you think would be best for that booth.  Yeah.  I guess the, uh, the ONA pest, they got to decide who, who's kind of in charge and all  the ideas will go through that person or those people.  And then, uh, you know, it's your booth, man, it's your booth to do whatever the hell you  want with it.  Yep.  When is Cleveland going to show today?  Oh, it's tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Uh, Dan, anything else?  Yeah, boys, real quick.  I got really, uh, one, uh, one thing for you.  I got a theme song for Mantown.  Check this out real quick.  Okay.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Hello. 
[00:11:00]  Going into the gay zone.  You're going into the gay zone.  Going into the gay, gay, gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, you know, pokey, pokey, and the fudge.  There you go.  All right.  I don't know how much, uh, are they going to dump out of that?  No, they probably will.  Yeah, they probably dumped out of the last part of that.  The ending.  Thank you.  Come on XM, so it doesn't matter.  That brought back some memories, though.  Yeah, thanks a lot, Dan.  All right, so, uh, the ONA Traveling Virus for all you Boston people.  August 5th, Worcester, DCU Center.  All the details are up on opianthony.com.  Tickets through ticketmaster.com. 
[00:11:30]  And, yes, we're coming to Cleveland.  September 23rd, Tower City Amphitheater.  Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, and possibly other comedians  to be announced in the coming weeks.  Mm-hmm.  We got a lot of time before this show hits, so, uh, we're going to continue developing  the Cleveland show.  Uh, what do we got?  We got, uh, tickets go on sale, uh, tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. through ticketmaster.com.  And ticketmaster outlets, and all the info is up on opianthony.com.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  Uh, Chris has a question from New Jersey here. 
[00:12:00]  Chris, what's up?  Hello?  What's up, Chris?  Hey, how you doing, man?  Uh, listen, since you returned to Terrestrial Radio, I'm a little upset that we haven't seen  the return of some of the old great bits that everybody's been asking for.  Ah.  Stuff like, uh, 55-gallon drum challenge.  I know the voya bus, too many people got arrested, but something similar to that, I'm just waiting  for, like, something huge.  You should have been at our little after-show meeting yesterday. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, we reset yesterday.  We were talking about a lot of the old bits and which ones we want to, you know, bring  back.  It took a couple of months just to get comfortable in the environment of Terrestrial Radio, to  tell you the truth, you know, after being off for two years, exiled, and then on satellite  radio for, uh, a while, for like a year and a half, and then we get here, settled in, we're  settled in, and we were just talking yesterday about the fact that, you know, we, uh, you can't  come in day one and expect people to show up for things, you know? 
[00:13:00]  You just end up with, uh, where is everybody?  Did someone call?  Why didn't they show up?  But now we're getting so many people showing up, like, after the show for the walk, that,  um, we have all the confidence in the world that we'll be able to get people up here to  do things.  And, uh, that's what we were talking about yesterday, getting some of these events going  again, getting people up here, uh, doing things.  Don't you worry.  There's a lot of classic bits that, uh, the old school listeners want brought back, and  I know that when they get brought back, the new listeners are just going to be blown away 
[00:13:30]  by what you guys could do.  Yeah, we're going to bring a lot of those, well, we're going to bring a bunch of them  back in the very near future, all right, Chris?  Thanks, guys.  All right, thanks.  Let's go to Jim in Ohio.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Jim.  Hey, um, yeah, the Cleveland show, I got on Ticketmaster.com last night, and I was actually  able to buy a pair of tickets already.  I think what they did, they did something special for the K-Rock listeners up there in  Cleveland.  They gave you guys first shot at, uh, at the tickets, and then it's, uh, being opened up 
[00:14:00]  to the, the general public.  Okay.  So I think you guys, you took advantage of, uh, the K-Rock thing they were running.  Oh, all right.  All right?  Punch it out.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Yep.  I think I know the, uh, problem in Boston, by the way.  Oh?  This show has been thrown off the air twice in Boston.  They've had enough, and they're not going to come around until they know you're staying.  You're like, this is like the abusive boyfriend that, like, as soon as you fall in love, he  punches you in the face, and the police take him away.  And this time, he just got back from rehab, and they want to make the thing. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, it's kind of like the, the family member that you, you finally have to give up on  because, you know, they, they, they continue to do the drugs and screw up, and you finally  have to just turn your back, and now that person has to talk his way back into the family.  I think Jimmy's right.  Like, they, they want to know that we have, uh, we have rehabbed, and, uh, we're going  to be around for a while.  Are they giving us tough love?  They really are.  Tough love leaving us outside.  Let us in.  We're fine now.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul.  Don't worry.  Hey, I'm here. 
[00:15:00]  Are you in Boston?  I'm in Boston.  Well, I'm a bit north of Boston, but yeah, I'm in Boston.  The Boston area.  All right, what's up?  And I don't listen to the, I don't listen to the gay show myself, but, Norton, you're still  a little freak.  You hit the nail on the head.  That's exactly what it is.  We're the jilted lovers.  Yep.  We've been smacked around.  We've trusted you guys.  We've loved you guys.  We've opened our arms to you guys, and that sounds a little queer, and I apologize, but  we love the show.  And you keep getting fired.  You'll get fired, and we'll come back.  You know what sucks about Boston for the new listeners and the people around the country? 
[00:15:30]  That's where Ant and I really, you know, cut our teeth, as they say.  And, um, and we were on top of the Boston radio world, and we got fired for the mayor's  thing, the mayor's prank.  And then, uh, it took us, I think, three years to get back on Boston radio, and we  were there less than a year, or just over a year, somewhere around there, and got fired  again.  Fired again.  And then we had to wait another four years to get back.  That's it. 
[00:16:00]  That's it.  And, and, um, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, we're losing your phone, uh, but, uh, you made the point.  What's going on?  I don't know.  All right.  There's some, there's a monkey playing cards on television.  I, I don't know.  Why don't we take our first break?  When we get back, we're just getting warmed up.  Uh, Anthony actually went to a movie theater last night.  That's the WB news.  Anthony went to a movie theater last night.  Yes, I did.  And there's one doing the weather.  I was out.  Out and about.  We'll talk about that.  Uh, we'll talk about what movie Anthony saw. 
[00:16:30]  The clerk's thing will not die.  No.  We, we got, uh, we got a mission for the pest today.  Oh yeah.  There is an ass out there that, uh, writes for Fox news, foxnews.com that just killed  us in an article about the, the Kevin Smith, uh, Joel Siegel fight and got it all wrong.  Yeah.  We'll give you the latest on that and, uh, lots and lots of stuff to do today.  So when we take our first break and regroup here, it's the ONA, uh, virus spreading.  Yes, Kenny.  You're right.  All right. 
[00:17:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:17:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Dave in New York has a message for Boston. 
[00:18:00]  What's up, Dave?  Make it fast.  Yo, I was just going to say, man, you guys have these homos out in Boston.  They got to get with it.  Who gets the eggs out for radio?  You guys.  Yo, watch out, man.  These guys in Boston, homos.  Oh, that's going to help us.  We might have, uh, city fights today.  That's city wars.  City wars.  They, they flare up every once in a while.  Lob a few missiles into, uh, each other's cities.  Let's try to keep everything calm right now. 
[00:18:30]  But I don't think the, I don't think Boston's going to accept, uh, what was just said.  I don't think they want to be called homos.  Boston?  No.  No.  Can I say as much as I don't like critics, I'm so happy to be reading that Lady in the Water is getting smashed by everybody.  Yes, it is.  The new M. Night.  And no one even, uh, has to say his full name anymore.  It's just, oh yeah, M. Night.  M. Night, because no one can remember Shang-a-Malang.  Shang-a-Malang.  Shang-a-Malang.  Shang-a-Malang.  You don't need to remember his name anymore. 
[00:19:00]  He's, it's over, Johnny, for him.  Yeah, this one is a thing.  He had one brilliant film, which was, uh, Sixth Sense, I thought it was brilliant, and just a great movie.  Yeah.  But it's like, you know, it's like putting out your first record, man, or your first comedy CD.  It's like all those years of work.  You had your whole life to write your first record, and now you got three months come up with the same thing.  Wait, what was after, what was after the, uh, Sixth Sense?  People were like, ugh.  Uh, well.  Wasn't that Signs?  Breakable?  Uh, Breakable was the next one.  Oh, Breakable was the next one?  It was Breakable, then Signs. 
[00:19:30]  Unbreakable.  Unbreakable, then Signs, then The Village, and now Lady in the Water.  Oh, progressively into the toilet here.  Well, Signs point to a good movie, Jill Siegel.  Wait, wait.  Did we say Signs, too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, there's a, there's a, there's a chart in the paper just showing it go...  Lady in the Water all wet.  It's all right to be all wet, though.  So what are the critics saying about Lady in the Water?  It's getting like one star, one and a half stars. 
[00:20:00]  Um, well, let's see, uh, the Las Vegas Weekly, you wonder if, uh, Shane Malin, or whatever his name is, has crossed from mere self-regard into actual mental illness.  Philadelphia Weekly.  That's not a good review.  No.  Has, has M. Nightmare lost his damn mind?  Uh, this other one, uh, Groucho Reviews, I hated Lady in the Water because it's stupid.  And my favorite is eFilmCritic.com.  I just wanted to punch the movie right in the face.  I wanted to punch the movie right in the face, not even him.  Yeah, just the movie. 
[00:20:30]  Just get up to the screen and punch the movie in the face.  After that sucky village.  The village.  Oh, it was just awful.  It's always, he tries to come across as being very deep.  Yeah.  And it just comes out as dreck.  It's, oh, wow, it was a good point you made.  Shut up.  Like, and the surprise ending thing is very big for him.  He wants, like, this big thing where people go, oh, wow.  That's it.  No, that was it.  He was dead the whole movie.  Oh, it's, it's actually modern day times.  Oh, boy. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, the ending of Signs.  Oh, her dying and saying what she said wasn't just some kooky stuff.  It was actually what he had to do.  And so what is this one?  I've heard the end of the movies.  Because I've watched them a couple of times.  I've watched them too, but I forgot.  The new one, The Lady in the Water.  All the trailer looks like to me is, I could, and all that pops into my mind,  even though it's very vague and stuff, just the camera angles.  And what's happening is the gopher from Caddyshack is in this guy's backyard. 
[00:21:30]  That's all I keep thinking of.  Like the sprinklers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And something's popping up out of his backyard.  Gophers!  I want gophers off this golf course.  I'll find myself a new greenskeeper.  Is that clear?  It just looks stupid.  It does.  It looks lame.  Starring Scott Peterson.  Stupid movie.  Yeah, it's going to be a disaster.  Hey, speaking of movies, our own Anthony.  Oh, yeah, the bad wolf puppet in the trailer for Lady in the Water. 
[00:22:00]  It's like a wolf thing involved.  Actually, the wolf thing looks like the creature from the village a little bit.  A little spiky back thing.  Ugh.  Just enough for this guy.  You're right.  He hit it lucky with a sixth sense.  And then it's been a disaster ever since.  Anthony did something very rare last night.  He went to the movie theater.  Left my house.  Yeah, but I go to the movie theater where it's just, you know, nothing but my favorite tribe of people on the planet. 
[00:22:30]  The Jew.  I adore the Jews.  I live amongst them.  As a Catholic, I live amongst the Jews.  They accept me.  They might say things behind my back, but I don't care.  I don't hear them.  But the neighborhood's great.  The lawns, Hopi.  So well kept.  You know what happens when I back out of my garage at four in the morning?  Everyone's sprinkler is going. 
[00:23:00]  Keeping all the grass green.  And then every day there's another group of Mexicans on one of their lawns making sure it's well manicured and groomed the way it should be.  So when I go to the movies now.  Do you honk at your neighbors as you're leaving?  Uh, yeah.  Give them a little...  Hey, how you doing, neighbor?  How you doing?  Or a little light flash so you don't wake anyone at the hour you're leaving. 
[00:23:30]  That's true.  And I kind of pull...  I think my neighbors do see my sweeping, like, bright headlights go through their window every morning.  Goddamn Catholic.  Goddamn Jesus lover.  And I'll leave.  Go to work.  But, uh, I love the neighborhood because I went to the movies and, uh, it wasn't like that time I went to the movie theater in Brooklyn where I had my problem.  Where, uh, where a woman went into what she called, what her boyfriend called battle mode after my girlfriend told her to shut the F up. 
[00:24:00]  Because, uh, she was just saying how great Tom Cruise was and how, oh, here he is.  Oh, that Tom Cruise.  What I would do to him.  Oh, there he is, baby.  There he is.  And, uh, my girlfriend turned around and goes, could you shut the F up?  And I just went, oh, okay, I'm dead.  I'm so dead.  And then her boyfriend says something like, no, you didn't.  Her boyfriend kind of gets up a little bit out of his chair and comes, leans toward me.  And I go, I'm punched in the face.  This is over, Johnny.  And he didn't even do anything. 
[00:24:30]  He just goes to me.  He goes, oh, she just put her in battle mode.  I went, battle mode?  She's a transformer or something, you know?  And, uh, we actually had to leave that theater.  It was for, uh, Mission Impossible 2, I believe it was.  And, uh, had to leave the theater because it was just the threat of violence.  She wouldn't shut up either.  Like, after the situation should have just ended, she kept turning around and going,  no, whack, they're going to tell me to shut up.  Shut up.  I'll tell you to shut up.  You don't tell.  And she kept turning around like, tell me to shut up. 
[00:25:00]  I said, I'm not shutting up.  I'll talk all I want.  I paid my ticket.  I got, oh.  So now I go in.  Well, the mission was to get out of the theater alive, first of all.  You had your own mission.  And then you went into the.  Anthony, your mission, if you decide to accept it, is go to this Brooklyn movie theater and survive.  And I don't accept it.  I'm disavowing any knowledge of being in this theater.  Thank you.  And then they had another theater, uh, showing Mission Impossible for all the people that  were too scared to see it with, uh, the darkies. 
[00:25:30]  I'm not kidding.  It was a whole theater.  There were about 10 of us or 12 of us.  The other theater was packed.  There were 10 or 12 of us, all petrified white people sitting like with our pride just  gone in some other room somewhere, sitting there thinking of how we should have done  something else to look more manly and then enjoying the movie because we were chased out  of the black and Puerto Rican portion of the theater in Brooklyn.  That's how it is, though.  You just got to accept it.  And that's it.  I'm not going to get stabbed over a Tom Cruise movie. 
[00:26:00]  It's just not going to happen.  And there were, you know, you realize when you say shut the F up to somebody and they  turn around, you realize how many people are with them.  The whole row was with her.  They brought the whole family.  Crying babies on one end, grandma on the other, and everyone else in between.  Just, uh-oh, uh-oh.  You know you did it.  Like, no, you're right.  I didn't.  She did. 
[00:26:30]  And boy, did she get a firm talking to when we got to the white part of the theater.  It was just all white guys chastising their girlfriends like men, trying to just regain  any bit of manliness we had left.  Yeah, that's when you get brave, right there.  Hey, you effing mouth off like that again.  Oh, it's just a horror.  Women don't as much appreciate the consequences of those things.  No.  Because the majority of times, women handle things typically differently than men do, 
[00:27:00]  and they don't realize that they're going to get you punched in the face.  But they also look at you like you're the man of the relationship.  They look at you like you're their superhero.  Look, I'm the man of the relationship, but I'm no superhero when it comes to fighting off  five or six black guys in a movie theater.  It ain't going to happen.  I'm not going to be the guy on video.  Look at this poor son of a bitch.  Poof, just getting his boot in the head.  It's not going to be me.  And it's not going to be a girl getting me in that situation.  That's for sure.  And how many people out there have been lucky enough to have your chick reach over and start 
[00:27:30]  beeping the horn while you're driving?  Oh, that's a good one.  In a really bad situation.  It's not like there's a minivan in the way.  It's usually like an Asian guy or something.  It's usually like a pack of, you know, in that van full of like Asian graffiti.  Yeah.  Driving fish to some restaurant somewhere.  Him, he's so beepable.  Yeah.  Get out of the way.  It's usually a pack of Hell's Angels going for a ride.  It's like, gee, thanks.  Thanks for putting me in this bad position.  Motorcycles.  Me, me, me, me. 
[00:28:00]  Because they immediately turn around and see you driving the car.  They don't realize that it was your chick that reached over and decided she needed to,  you know.  Beep at a Toyota Celica with a spoiler on it with a Latin King's emblem on the back.  Right.  Yeah, thanks.  Could you not be, could you just not even make eye contact?  I'll actually throw a chick out of the car and go, well, now you're going to learn the  error of her ways.  I'll be back in an hour, fellas.  They will teach you.  Leave her here for me.  Teach her a good lesson.  So, you went and saw Pirates?  Saw Pirates the Caribbean. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two, of course.  I heard it stinks.  No, it was pretty good.  It was pretty good?  I don't think it's as good as the first one.  Yeah, I don't think it's as good as the first one, but some really good scenes and stuff.  The CGI was great.  And a lot of controversy over the ending of this is what it was.  Because everyone's saying, there's no ending.  Just kind of stops.  Movie just kind of ends, and that's it.  But it ends just like Lord of the Rings, you know, the first two Lord of the Rings or 
[00:29:00]  The Matrix 2, something like that.  Like I was telling you in the back office, that's not fine, because this wasn't set up  as a trilogy.  Yeah, no one really expected it.  Those other movies were kind of set up like a trilogy.  You knew.  Well, Lord of the Rings was definitely a trilogy.  Was Matrix set up like a trilogy at first?  When the second Matrix came out, you knew that a third one was coming out.  And it was pretty quick.  It was like in a matter of only a couple of months, because they had filmed them together.  So, you didn't have to wait a year.  So, you knew a third one was coming.  So, the way the second one ended was very stark and just cut off at the end. 
[00:29:30]  It was over.  However, this one does the same thing, kind of.  Kind of.  It's more like it leaves – it doesn't just end.  It kind of leaves you in limbo there, knowing the characters are there, certain characters,  you know, you speculate as to what happened to them, because they're kind of gone.  But you know they're not dead.  They've got to come back for the next movie.  And then other characters kind of make surprise entrances from the first movie.  It's just kind of a thing like that, and that's how it ends.  So, I don't think it ended as starkly as people like to say it did. 
[00:30:00]  And it makes you kind of look forward to the third one.  Yeah.  I think they're pretty cool, fun movies, you know, mindless kind of thing.  But the effects are good.  I like the three-way sword fight was pretty good, and the fight on the water wheel.  Well, what did you like the best about the movie?  Oh, Johnny Depp.  Oh, no.  Oh, sorry.  I was watching Logo last night.  We got some Logo programming.  We got some Logo programming.  Later on in the show.  Gay television on Cablevision. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, we're starting a new bit today.  We're looking at the Logo channel.  Logo.  Who had to watch the Logo channel?  Sam?  Oh.  And then.  At the same time?  Yeah.  Were you holding each other?  Only one could watch while the other's head goes up and down.  It's a gay network.  Yeah.  Brand new bit starts today.  Anyway, we're going to look at a show called Noah's Ark, a series about four black gay  guys.  Yeah.  But, no, the kid in the movie theater.  Yeah, in the movie theater. 
[00:31:00]  It was, like I said, a Jewish movie theater.  You go in there, and it's nothing but Jewish people, so the theater's pretty quiet.  Everyone knows not to talk.  They shut off their cell phones.  It's just wonderful, the Jews.  Love them.  But one thing that was a little disturbing is it brought a lot of children.  There were a lot of kids at this showing, but not, of course, because you think, like,  Pirates of the Caribbean is going to be like the ride at Disney, and it's all fun.  The kids loved the first movie. 
[00:31:30]  You could come in if you're this high.  Come into a movie if you're this high.  And the kids loved the first movie.  This one, though, there are some scenes that are a little graphic as far as violence goes.  There's a big kraken.  Release the kraken!  Big sea monster type thing with tentacles and stuff, and it kind of comes up on the ship  and rips ships down out of the water.  But before it does that, it grabs people and just flings them around like ragdolls and whips  them into things.  And one scene, one guy gets pulled through one of the little holes that the cannons come 
[00:32:00]  out of, and you'd see his legs, and the tentacles are wrapped around him.  You'd just hear, like, as he gets cracked in half and pulled through.  And at that point...  Like you're working on a lobster.  Yeah, just...  You hear a big cracking noise, and the guy kind of cracks in two.  Uh, and this little girl is sitting there and goes, Mommy, I don't want to see this movie  anymore!  To which I just start laughing hysterically.  Just something about horrified crying children that makes me laugh. 
[00:32:30]  Makes me laugh when they can't take something like that.  Violence, blood, a little bit of gore, and they still go, I don't want to see this!  And I think it goes back to me, because I had that happen to me when, um, I think it  was 1969, something like that, and I was, uh, I don't know, 20.  I was 20 years old at the time.  No, I think I was, like, seven or something. 
[00:33:00]  Uh, and my mother and father decided we were gonna all go to the drive-in, and that was  a big thing back then.  You get in your PJs and your jammies, and you, you get in the car and, and put the stupid  big speaker on the window that, like, sounded horribly.  That's how the movie sounded, through that crappy speaker.  And, um, Bonnie and Clyde, you know, what, what, Warren Beatty's in it, uh, movie about 
[00:33:30]  the, uh, the crime duo there.  How's a nice, uh...  Back in the Depression.  Nice surprise ending?  Yeah, nice surprise ending.  Well, that's what happened.  I started feeling a little queasy when, uh, the gunfight broke out where Blanche got shot  in the eye, and, um, who else was in that?  It was Blanche's husband.  Oh, no.  He got shot up pretty, pretty bad.  Gene Hackman in that?  Gene Hackman, right.  He got shot up pretty bad, and I'm like, oh, boy.  And we had just been to Arby's and got big roast beef sandwiches beforehand, so I'm, like, 
[00:34:00]  eating roast beef sandwich, and I'm a little kid, and it's great.  I'm at the drive-in in my pajamas, and we're watching, and then, uh, by the time the end  came, where, uh, they just pull up, and, and, uh, the birds fly out of the bushes, and,  uh, Bonnie looks, or Clyde looks over at Bonnie, and they kind of give this knowing look that  they're just dead, and they get ambushed, and the scene lasts for quite a while, and they  just get shot full of holes, blood.  They're just kind of worse than the sunny toll booth scene. 
[00:34:30]  It just goes on and on and on.  Slow motion, too, right?  A little bit, yeah, a little bit of slow motion.  Yeah, but when you see the birds fly out of the trees, that's a great shot.  Yeah, they give that look, like, oh, boy, we screwed up here.  Uh, yeah.  And I proceeded to just vomit my roast beef sandwich all over the car.  In the car?  In the car.  In the car, I just project hot everywhere.  But that's what happens. 
[00:35:00]  You don't take a kid to a movie like that.  My parents were insane.  Crazy people.  Wasn't a Disney movie out?  Didn't Oliver come out the same year?  Couldn't you have taken me to see that?  Took me to see Bonnie and Clyde.  Why did you throw up out the window?  Because I'm a kid, and I, I, I, you don't, you don't think.  Because you're a kid, and you want the attention.  You're, no, I didn't want the attention.  It's, it's absolutely the truth.  I knew there were going to be problems.  Even kids know they can, like, puke, like, outside the car or outside a house, but they 
[00:35:30]  just want the attention.  And with the crappy speaker, you needed all the windows kind of rolled up, because you  didn't want outside sound to kind of screw things up, and the car was hot, and you can't  just push a button and unroll the window.  You got to roll it down, and I'm a little kid trying to roll down an old Rambler window.  What did Mommy and Daddy do after you puked?  Oh, no, Jesus Christ, Joey, he's throwing up, you know, all the sympathy in the world.  Son of a bitch, right out the window, get Rowe, get him out of the car. 
[00:36:00]  What the hell is this?  You're ruining the goddamn movie.  And Daddy had to clean up.  And then, no, Mom, of course, had to go to the snack bar and get some club soda and napkins  and clean me up.  And it didn't end.  Like, they were carrying me in the house after the drive back from the theater.  They are taking me from the car, carrying me out of the house, and I'm puking in the  driveway.  Like, I couldn't get the image out of my mind.  And how psyched was your dad that he got to take a shower with you to clean you up? 
[00:36:30]  No, there was no showering after that.  What?  I think I was sponged off by Mommy.  Jimmy, help me out here.  You said that your dad is the one who taught you and Joe how to shower?  Not on the same night as the Bonnie and Clyde movie.  Well, he wanted to make sure that you were taught right, though.  He wanted to see what you learned.  No.  Show you how to get clean, son.  That's right.  No, I believe Mommy just cleaned me up with a washcloth.  It was a surprise exam.  And sent me to bed.  Sissy.  Oh, I was the biggest fairy Mary. 
[00:37:00]  I was a fairy Mary up until I was about 12 years old.  A little crybaby sissy.  I would just cry over everything.  Mother, they're shooting.  They didn't accept my little Italian treat things I brought to International Day at school.  I brought little Italian cookies and everyone was making fun of them saying they looked like dog duty.  So I came home from school crying that day. 
[00:37:30]  Did they say that?  Yeah.  A girl kicked me in the groin one day.  Just walked up and kicked me in the groin.  And I'm laying on the floor.  And she's pointing at me laughing.  I could never, like, be the guy.  Hey, while you were puking, were your parents, like, you know, doing some of that necking?  Necking, making out.  And all they wanted was a little, like, you know, a little, you know, make-out time.  I don't know if my dad was necking. 
[00:38:00]  Unless he had some secretary from Connecticut he was banging at the time in the car with him.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I've never heard that one before.  Things like there might be a story there, too.  I don't think dad was the most faithful father in Hope.  Dude, I've been working with you for many years.  I haven't heard this one yet.  Oh, my father used to have a vending machine.  He didn't have a vending machine company.  He worked for a vending machine company.  My father had, like, a billion jobs in, like, so many years.  Every year we were moving.  Hey, kids, pack up. 
[00:38:30]  We're moving again.  Why?  Oh, we're just, you know, we're moving.  Never told the reason.  You know, dad's out of work again.  So he had this vending machine job where he had a big van.  And it was just full of, like, little packages of M&Ms and stuff.  And his job was to get the quarters out of the machines and fill up the machines with the M&Ms.  And Hershey bars and things like that.  So there were nights where, for dinner, we would just have candy.  He'd come in the house and just, here's some M&Ms and, you know, Hershey bars.  But one of his runs would take him up into Connecticut. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And for some reason, it's so important to be a candy vending machine storage guy that he would sometimes have to spend the night up there, I guess.  Or, you know, work late until 3 in the morning and then come home.  And my mother was like, I was always suspicious that he had something going on up there.  You think?  Yeah.  You think?  There's always that, though.  My father was one of those, you know, players.  Always wanted to be a player.  And then when they finally got divorced, he got set up at some crappy little place, I think in Mineola or something. 
[00:39:30]  And we used to go over there for the weekends.  And he used to have his broads there.  And they'd always try to, like, act like, you know, the mommy type.  Not really trying to be a mommy.  But they didn't know what the hell to do.  All of a sudden, you know, my father's banging this girl who was probably, like, 19 or 20 or something like that.  And there's three kids over the house.  And she don't know what to do.  She's a kid herself.  And she's got to deal with, like, three kids.  All she wanted was the Italian hog.  All she wants is dad's hog. 
[00:40:00]  And she's got to spend the weekend with three lousy kids yelling and one crying all the time.  Joe and his two sisters.  She's playing chutes and ladders with the kids in between sex sessions.  Absolutely.  Anytime there was a problem, like, my mother or father would start arguing.  And that was, like, all the time.  I would be the one that would come out of the room and be like, I have a stomach ache.  Like, to try to make it stop. 
[00:40:30]  Ew.  I have a stomach ache.  Codependent.  Go back in your room.  Jen Brady.  The middle child.  I totally was.  Oh.  Totally was.  It explains a lot, though.  I remember.  You know something?  I remember when I was creeping up on, like, 12 years old when, like, all this pretty much stopped.  Yeah.  It was, we live in an East Islip.  And my mother holds this big powwow and brings the three of us up into the room and says,  sit down. 
[00:41:00]  I have something to talk to you about.  And believe me, we never met like this and talked or anything.  And she goes, me, we want you to know this has nothing to do with you children or anything  like the textbook speech.  But me and your father are getting a divorce.  And I was relieved.  I was like, thank God.  Thank God no more of this crap.  Thank God no more showers.  No more showers.  No more faking my period to get them to stop yelling. 
[00:41:30]  I can't even look at him.  You know, my stomach hurts, mother.  There was one day I was, I was upset about something and I was, I went to gym class and  I actually told the gym teacher, he goes, uh, why, why aren't you participating, Cumia?  And I said, uh, teacher, I have cramps.  I had, I had like gas pains, you know, but I, I had called them cramps and he goes, what  the hell?  He looked at me and said, what the hell are you talking about?  You can't have cramps.  Only women get cramps. 
[00:42:00]  And I'm not even old enough to realize why or how or who, he didn't explain it, but  I just thought like I was cramping up because I had like gas.  So I told him I had cramps.  So you're not too far off.  That's the period thing.  That's wonderful.  And he yelled at you and you said, look, I don't need this.  I feel fat as it is.  I was just the biggest pussy.  You know, you would fake sickness to get them to stop?  Yeah.  I have a stomach ache.  That was my biggest line.  They used to make fun of me all the time.  Like my brother and sister, I have a stomach ache.  It was all I would, I would try to like diffuse the situation by saying that I was sick. 
[00:42:30]  Please help me.  Just to get some, uh, some love.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, just to get some love.  Mother and father, stop yelling at each other.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  When we get back, uh, we got to give this guy from Fox News a talking to.  A talking to.  He needs to be corrected.  Wait till you hear what he says about, uh, our fine listeners.  We'll do that next.  Also, Dr. Ian Smith is here from Celebrity Fit Club, a friend of ours stopping by to say 
[00:43:00]  hi.  What's up?  Yes.  We'll talk to him next as well.  We got a couple of the guys from Clerks 2 coming in.  We got to, uh, take a little peek at the, uh, at the gay channel, the Logo channel.  Logo.  Oh, my.  And no one, uh, reminded us.  Ooh.  We give the listeners, uh, you know, a job from time to time.  Homework.  Homework.  I said yesterday, please remind us about the deaf reporter from Chicago.  We're going to do that, uh, in the very near future as well.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:43:30]  Oh.  Come on.  Oh.  Come on.  Oh.  Come on.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Clerks 2 getting good reviews today.  Congrats to Kevin Smith and the gang. 
[00:44:00]  Good friend of the show.  And, uh, we got into some controversy with Kevin Smith and Joel Siegel.  I guess it started with Joel Siegel actually walking out of a screening of Clerks 2.  Yeah.  Saying it's the first, uh, movie.  The first effing movie.  He's walked out in 30 effing years.  Something like that.  Yeah.  30 years.  There's a critic screening and he got up and walked out and made kind of a ruckus on the way out.  Yeah.  Just disturbed everybody's, uh, viewing pleasure. 
[00:44:30]  Yep.  So it's, uh, made, uh, page six of the New York Post and we happen to have Kevin Smith on the next day.  We talked about it and then Joel Siegel, uh, we got him on the phone and then Kevin Smith and Joel Siegel went at it.  Although Joel Siegel had no idea that he was talking to Kevin Smith for the 10, for the first 10 or 15 minutes of the fight.  Yeah, that was a little sad.  And then, uh, that hit the papers and, uh, the internet.  It's all over the place.  And, uh, I guess E! Entertainment's doing something on it.  They wanted the audio from the show. 
[00:45:00]  So we sent that off this morning.  And then you got this guy, uh, Roger Friedman.  A jerk-off.  He does the Fox 411 for FoxNews.com.  411, that's like information on the phone.  So he, that's like information.  Fox 411.  Yeah, he does the Fox 411 for FoxNews.com.  And he wrote an article on the whole thing.  And the article, uh, is titled,  Clerks, Donkey vs. Critic, Each is Right. 
[00:45:30]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  By Roger Friedman.  The donkey in Clerks 2 is actually very funny, not very smutty.  Joel Siegel is a good critic and a really nice guy who's allowed to lose his patience even for a funny donkey.  Everyone just stop right there.  Hey, Roger's saying stop.  Everyone just stop right here.  He'll, he'll set it straight now.  Do you know I'm actually biting the inside of my lip as I'm reading this?  Yeah.  That's why I didn't want you to read it ahead of time. 
[00:46:00]  Because I wanted the natural reaction because Jimmy loves this stuff.  So he was going to write an article on, uh, you know, what happened.  But he has to stop the article to, to address something else.  And here we go.  I'm more appalled listening to the nasty, disrespectful assault on Siegel that occurred on the Opie and Anthony radio show yesterday morning.  Why do they underline radio?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Radio's underlined and it's in bold, uh, bold type.  It's unbelievable that these two jackasses or jackals.  Jackals, we're jackals. 
[00:46:30]  It's unbelievable that these two jackals are back on the air, especially after being expunged four years for broadcasting a sex act from inside St. Patrick's Cathedral.  He's appalled.  Roger Friedman.  Wait, Roger, we're not allowed to work again?  Is that what you're trying to say?  Never again.  He's just a scumbag.  Opie and Anthony, real names.  Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia.  Oh, the cat's out of the bag.  And I'm saying, uh, our name's really loud because it's in bold face.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Made their way as Howard Stern wannabes a long time ago.  That's right.  What an answer.  I want to be working four days a week for half a billion dollars and go to the Hamptons in the Howie Copter.  I hope the O&A pests are listening very closely today.  Ready for this next line?  Yeah.  No one over 12 actually listens to them with the exception of people who claim English as a third language.  What does that mean?  Like, no one over 12 actually listens to them, really. 
[00:47:30]  Did you check that out?  Did you go through any ratings facts?  It's good to know.  Jack off?  It's good to know you could use, like, third grade insults as an adult.  That's like hack stuff.  That's like hack stuff when you want to get to somebody or try to get to somebody.  And people who claim English as a third language, that's smart.  It's funnier than a second language, though, because, like, if you claim English as a second language, that means you're probably, like, Spanish. 
[00:48:00]  But if you claim there's a third language, it's funnier because...  Because it probably means you're well-educated.  That's what I get.  English as a second language is like, okay, I get it.  The guy's Spanish or something, which I don't understand.  Spanish listenership up for us?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But as a third language, that's now pretty smart.  That means you, like, study abroad.  Right.  Like, you're really, really smart.  Hey, Roger, worst insult ever.  He stinks. 
[00:48:30]  Roger Friedman is a...  I can't tell you how badly...  I want to bite his lips off.  Well, it gets better.  Spit him in his face.  So he writes, no one over 12 actually listens to them with the exception of people who claim English as a third language.  That's why picking a fight with somebody, anybody, even slightly famous, has to be their goal at this point.  Right.  As he picks a fight with this show.  Their ratings...  Ready for this?  Their ratings, slim at best.  Slim at best.  Really?  You're a journalist.  Where are you getting your info from, Roger Friedman? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  You must have looked at the ratings.  If you're writing this down as a responsible journalist, you would have had to have looked at the ratings to see that they are slim at best.  Wouldn't he?  Wouldn't he?  Yeah.  Did he?  No.  No.  Because we're doing very, very well.  And why don't you go talk to Eric Logan at XM Satellite Radio.  He'll talk to you about the ratings and give you the real picture, Roger.  Mm-hmm.  Their ratings, slim at best, might possibly improve if they could just get some publicity. 
[00:49:30]  The Siegel Smith...  Oh, boy.  I don't know that word.  Contra temps.  Contra temps, I think.  You think?  That's an embarrassing kind of...  That's a third language.  ...an embarrassing situation of contra temps.  All right.  He's getting really...  The Siegel Smith contra temps was a perfect storm for them over the last two days.  But picking on Siegel for walking out of Clerks 2 is a sad way for them to go about their juvenile business.  Yeah, he's right.  I don't know why we would address that. 
[00:50:00]  I mean, especially a guy who works for Fox.  Why would you want to capitalize on something that's happening to make your ratings better?  You really are a jerk-off.  Do you know that?  Roger Friedman?  You're a jerk-off from head to toe.  And so is whoever you married.  Yeah, Roger Friedman...  Your wife's a jerk-off.  What do you think of them apples?  And a whore.  You got to do some research.  You got to do some research.  I can't say that.  Oh, you can't?  I just had a dump out of Jimmy.  Well, I can give my opinion.  Yeah, if you want to give up.  It's not about a public figure's wife.  Yeah, no. 
[00:50:30]  You say she's a jerk?  No, you don't know her.  You know how many lawsuits have been won for things you just said?  Not just said.  Yeah, not just made.  One.  One.  It's not even, yeah, argued.  That's a no-brainer one.  I don't know if these married...  We just saved you probably a million dollars, so I expect a little luck.  Thank my thumb.  Kiss Anthony's thumb right now.  He probably saved you a thousand, a million dollars.  By the way, if something said in humor like that, he'd never win a lawsuit on.  Oh, yeah?  All right, well, good luck to you, buddy. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  Remember, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony had nothing to do with...  That's right.  I said it.  With Jim Norton's confidence.  I'm Jim Norton, and I made a funny.  That's why I can say I hope that Roger dies, but I can't make fun of what spouse he may have.  Right.  You've got to leave the spouses out of it, unfortunately.  Unless they're public figures, too.  Yep.  That's the rule.  See, we're smart.  That's how it works.  Unlike a lot of TV and radio critics, Siegel happens to be one of the most serious-minded 
[00:51:30]  and erudite and erudite.  I don't know.  Erudite?  Erudite.  I don't know these...  I don't need to know these words.  Erudite means smart.  You hear me just saying...  So why can't he just say smart?  Because he's erudite.  Because he's trying...  There you go.  He's trying erudite.  Just use the words...  I don't...  I hate people that have to show how smart they are by using bigger words for the same  freaking thing.  Let's keep it nice here.  He also appreciates independent filmmakers more than most reviewers whose audience is 
[00:52:00]  mainstream.  Does he?  I'm surprised he hasn't uttered more expletives during a variety of films in the last quarter  of the century.  I know I have many times and even walked out of a couple of things that were too preposterous  for words.  Of course, Clerks 2 is actually a genially raucous comedy.  And the donkey is actually a hilarious ode to the famed shot-dead horse in Animal House.  You should have referenced Bachelor Party before the horse in Animal House, right? 
[00:52:30]  If Siegel had stayed a couple more minutes, he might have been very amused.  But then again, maybe not.  You do reach a point...  It's almost over.  You do reach a point after seeing hundreds of films when the sight of something coming  that could be very offensive is more than a critic wants to deal with.  That's his prerogative, and he's welcome to tell his audience that.  Now he goes back to us.  I rather doubt that if Siegel had yelled, I'm leaving at the top of his voice in the Clerks  2 screening room, which he didn't, that anyone with even the most delicate sensibilities 
[00:53:00]  could have minded that much.  I mean, the donkey was getting ready to get down.  He did.  He did get up and yell, I'm leaving, and threw out an expletive.  He did do that, you jackass.  He was on our show and admitted that he did that.  Kevin Smith knows he did that.  He saw it.  This is called well-researched journalism.  This whole article is so well-researched journalism.  Roger Friedman is a dope. 
[00:53:30]  A no-fact-gathering ass.  And then, of course, he has to take his last shot at us.  On the other hand, I wish that Hughes and Cumia would have their producers do a little  research rather than attack people on the air without provocation.  There's such a thing as bad karma.  It's instant, and no one needs to bait as much as they have with this little prefab scandal.  Prefab scandal?  A guy from Fox News talking about bad karma from taking something and making more of it 
[00:54:00]  than it should be?  Yeah.  What a scumbag.  Well, let me throw some insight on this whole little article on that little controversy.  This idiot, this jerk-off, doesn't even understand that Kevin Smith was in here talking to Joel  Siegel.  Well, that's what I get from this.  I get that he thinks, because he probably didn't hear the show, he thinks me and you 
[00:54:30]  Well, a lot of these guys rang up on Joel Siegel because of what he said about Kevin Smith's  movie.  Well, a lot of these guys, and they write for some pretty serious publications, they write  major articles on hearsay, on things they heard.  And then, you know, you would think a really good journalist would maybe hear some things  like, did you hear what Opie and Anthony did today?  And then you as the journalist would maybe do some research.  Have your producers maybe do a little research, Roger Friedman. 
[00:55:00]  And see what is true and what is not.  But then he writes a whole article on just some hearsay.  Not knowing that 90% of the discussion with Joel Siegel was done by Kevin Smith, the director  of the movie, not by Opie, Anthony, or Jimmy.  We could give a crap about Joel Siegel.  It turned out that day that it was in page six of the Post, and we just happened to have  the director of Clerks 2 in.  It was perfect timing for us.  So we figured we'd get him on the phone?  Right.  Get him on the phone and have them two go at it. 
[00:55:30]  Because it's very rare that a director gets to confront a critic in a public forum.  Very rare that happens.  Or that he will.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it was great that they were able to hash that out on the air and on our show, of course.  We want that done on our show.  This idiot doesn't even realize it was Kevin Smith who was talking to Joel Siegel, not Opie  and Anthony, ripping them apart.  So do a little more research, you schmuck. 
[00:56:00]  I just heard that the audio was played on CNN last night.  It's going to be played on E! Entertainment News tonight.  Hoo-hoo Higgy from the Jersey Shore.  Please call this guy out now.  He has the nuts to claim that you did no research while throwing out factless comments.  Yeah.  The guy's got everything wrong in this.  It's Fox411 on foxnews.com, and his name is Roger Friedman.  If anybody out there knows him, we have a lot of listeners, maybe... 
[00:56:30]  We're trying to get him on the phone, but of course he's going to hide.  Oh, this pussy will not get on the phone.  See, that's the thing we said about Joel Siegel.  We were beating him up pretty bad about what he said, and mostly Kevin Smith, to be honest  with you.  And we beat him up pretty good, and he still came on our show, so we respect Joel Siegel  for doing that.  This guy isn't coming on our show to confront us.  The only time we chimed in during that whole Joel Siegel-Kevin Smith exchange was to  clear things up with Joel, like to make sure his point was coming across, because he was  very vague. 
[00:57:00]  He didn't understand that Kevin was even in the studio.  And yeah, we did make fun of him, and we did attack him a little, and I'd do it again.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't we?  What's the problem with that?  Absolutely.  Yeah, we have a very strong opinion about that.  Absolutely.  If you're a movie critic, and you're going to the screening of Clerks 2, a really big  summer movie that's coming out, you know, it's your job to sit through the whole thing.  It's your job.  He was being unprofessional, Roger, like you as a journalist.  Unprofessional.  You're an unprofessional dreck.  You didn't check your facts. 
[00:57:30]  You didn't make sure who was talking to who.  It was Kevin talking to Joel.  I wish the producers would have done a little research.  How about you do a little research?  Because you're wrong, Roger Freeman.  Love to get you on the phone, but you're a faggot who won't come on the phone with us,  will you?  You won't come on.  All right.  Jackass.  Well, Clerks 2 is getting some good reviews today.  Two and a half stars is the average for the New York papers, and we got a couple of the 
[00:58:00]  guys from Clerks 2 coming in today to say hi.  Also, Donald Trump is calling at 8 a.m., 8 o'clock, on his way down Atlantic City for  the Miss Universe.  Yeah, at least it's for Miss Universe, you know, not for, like, the Trump thing.  You can't get him yet?  What?  In all fairness, it might be too early.  He might not be at his desk right now.  Oh, stop.  He's probably fact-checking somewhere.  I know this idiot will not come on the station.  This idiot will not come on because he's wrong. 
[00:58:30]  Well, the Pests have a nice little mission today.  Have fun with Roger Friedman from Fox News.com.  We're fighting on all kinds of fronts.  That's right.  Rip them apart.  That's right.  All right.  There you have it.  But make sure your emails are very respectful.  Please.  Use words like erudite.  Yes.  Right.  Don't send pictures.  Respectful.  I'm going to call them a lying sack of crap.  Yeah, use a lot of big words in your attack.  One time somebody sent me... 
[00:59:00]  Fight big words with big words.  That's what I say.  Somebody sent me an email.  It was really funny.  It was a subject heading of something that seemed official.  And when I opened it up, it was a picture of nude men and some type of a really big insulting  caption on the inside of the email.  I couldn't believe I got that.  Oh, wow.  You know how annoying it was when I opened an email that I thought was going to be about  business or news?  Hi, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hey, Jim.  Some hot news for you right off the presses or something like that that I thought would be  news.  And I opened it and it's a picture of nude men.  I don't know of anyone who wouldn't be annoyed getting an email like that because I've gotten 
[00:59:30]  those before and it is very annoying.  Absolutely.  I don't think there's one person on the face of this earth, whether you're a radio guy,  television guy working in an office, a writer for Fox, anything.  Yeah.  A janitor.  A doctor, a doctor, that that wouldn't annoy.  Yeah.  Especially if it says something about Opie and Anthony.  I think it says something about Opie and Anthony.  Like on the email, I opened it up and there was a nude black gentleman and it just said  something about Opie and Anthony and I suck and I'm a faggot. 
[01:00:00]  I couldn't believe that they wrote me.  So the picture was hot?  Well, yeah.  I enjoyed it.  I kept closing and reopening it, hoping it would refresh me.  Well, well.  Let's go to Shane in the Bronx.  Shane.  Well, well.  Hi, gentlemen.  You know, this guy, he writes all this article and he says that your entire audience is 12.  He knows you're going to read it on the air.  What was the point of using all those big words that none of us could understand out here?  Poor 12-year-old audience.  Poor, poor people.  Oh, and one other thing, Ant, was it Bonnie and Clyde that made you throw up or the vaudeville 
[01:00:30]  and the Lucky Strike cigarette commercials?  Have a good day, gentlemen.  All right.  Very good day.  Let's all go to the snack bar.  Let's all go.  All right.  Stop cheating yourself, please.  How old are you?  Hey, let's go to Rick in New York.  Rick.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  First of all, I'm over 12 years old.  I'm a highly paid executive.  And until you guys came to New York, radio spunk.  You guys brought radio back to life. 
[01:01:00]  Well, this guy doesn't know what the heck he's talking about.  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  Thank you.  I mean, really.  This guy, Jesus.  And using big words, I don't know.  He's a journalist.  I mean, that's the best he has is to claim that only 12-year-olds listen to our show.  You know what?  That is so hack.  And our ratings are, what did he say?  Scant.  Slim at best.  Slim at best.  And this guy says a lot by saying we should never work.  We pretty much should never work again because of the Sex with Sam thing. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, really.  Trust me.  We paid for that little bit.  Absolutely.  We did a hard time.  We did a harder time than pedophiles.  You guys rock.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, you know, this is true, too.  And then we'll move on.  David in Texas.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm over 12 as well.  Big surprise there.  What?  Big surprise there.  Yeah.  All he had to do was look at the latest ratings that came out Monday, and he would have realized 
[01:02:00]  where, you know, the audience, you could have figured out the exact audience listening  to him.  This person's 12 plus.  It doesn't say 12 minus.  How about we haven't gotten a call in, like, two years on the air from a 12-year-old or  under?  Actually, guys, I'm probably your youngest caller.  What's that, sir?  I'm actually probably your youngest caller.  How old are you?  19.  Okay, yeah.  I hear a lot of older guys calling your show.  Does it make you hot?  How smooth are your abs?  All right, go ahead. 
[01:02:30]  So the point I'm trying to make is, first of all, Siegel came on.  That was cool of him to do.  Yeah.  And after you guys, you, you guys, and Kevin, Smith were trying to get him to, it actually  took you guys a while to get him to fess up to what you guys were doing.  David, David, you lost everybody already.  Your phone call should have taken 10 seconds.  We're up to a minute already.  You're not very good at public speaking, are you?  You're a little nervous?  You're a little nervous.  You made a very good comment to the phone screener.  Basically, you want to say, uh, Fox forgot to mention that Siegel. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he apologized.  Very good.  And I'd like to see Fox News, uh, have that on TV.  Oh, boy.  Your wheels are falling off.  Pull off to the side of the road and check the tire pressure.  Well, well, no, he raised a good, did he raise a good point about the engine's a mile behind?  He's got to, he's, he's got to get a tow truck now.  Well, no, I think that he's got to get this mess off the road.  If you're going to make a point, you should have a point. 
[01:03:30]  Take your time.  If you're going to make a point, you should have a point.  But this, uh, doesn't seem to be the first time Roger Freeman's, uh, gotten in trouble for his, uh, bull crap.  Oh, really?  Yeah, when the Passion of the Christ came out.  I guess he wrote about that.  Sometimes a journalist makes a mistake, and sometimes a journalist makes a mistake.  That's so heinous it's easily remedied by any fact-checking that the person's publisher deserves to be threatened with litigation,  and the person in question deserves to lose their job. 
[01:04:00]  Such is the story with today's breathtaking, inaccurate, and malicious fairy tale by Roger Freeman,  printed at foxnews.com, regarding the release pattern of the Passion of the Christ.  The premise of this unresearched mess is that, uh, news market films and Mel Gibson are avoiding big cities and Jewish populations  with the theatrical release pattern of the film.  So he went on and said that that's what Mel Gibson's doing, uh, uh, releasing the movie, uh,  so Jews won't, won't see it.  Right.  Uh, there have been no journalist who, uh, has been more critical of Gibson's self-fulfilling prophecy of style, 
[01:04:30]  of showing this film, uh, selectively, building a furor when his, uh, publicly claiming to be fearful that one will erupt,  uh, blah, blah, blah, media, blah, blah, blah, blah, more, blah, blah, blah.  Moreover, for Freeman, uh, Jew, to, uh, so incautiously swing these lies around like a bag full of angry cats  is, in my opinion, deeply damaging to Jews everywhere who do not wish to be accused of being willing to stoop to any depth  in order to maintain our position in society. 
[01:05:00]  And then it goes on to just call him a blatant liar, uh, shows his accusations and the truth of the matter.  Uh, shows, uh, Freeman's accusations of where the film wasn't playing when, in fact, it was playing at those theaters.  All right, so this guy is just a hack-lying sack.  Who doesn't do his homework.  Yep.  This guy is barely an open-miker.  Yeah, he's an open-miker for, uh, journalists.  Barely.  He's barely.  This Roger Friedman's a naughty boy who doesn't do his homework.  He's a hack-lazy journalist. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  Uh, finally, we get into the deaf reporter next.  I don't want to make fun of this, so I think we should handle this delicately.  All right, then we could go to the gay channel.  No, I'd say let's do, let's, I want, I want to address the handy, capable person.  Let's just do it like this and no one can hear.  They're hard of hearing.  All right.  Hard of hearing.  Stay there.  It's the O.N.A. virus, and we are spreading across America.  It's time for another O.P. and Anthony Show scream-along.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[01:06:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[01:06:30]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  They're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Dr. Ian Smith in studio.  A couple of the guys from Clerks 2 just arrived.  We'll get them into the festivities in just a bit here.  A couple quick phone calls.  Let's go to Dan in Cleveland.  Dan, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  I just wanted to say that I pre-registered on K-Lock in Cleveland,  and I wanted to let you know that I did get my ticket for the O&A traveling virus.  Nice.  We're really psyched because before we got fired four years ago, 
[01:07:00]  we were planning a visit to Cleveland,  so finally we get to go to Cleveland four years later.  But it's going to be a lot of fun, the O&A traveling virus.  Yeah, September 23rd.  And I also wanted to say that I'd have to agree on Roger on a point.  I actually am over 12 years old and do claim English as my third language.  Wait, English is really your third language?  Absolutely.  I was born in Yugoslavia.  I speak Romanian and Syrian,  and then I wanted to know if Mr. L. Dukes happens to speak Romanian and Serbian by any chance. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  Probably not.  Oh, no, no.  You might not want to skirt that one past him.  Yeah, don't do that to us.  Yeah.  How's he going to know?  How's the FCC going to know?  Well, they're all knowing, all seeing.  No, it's weird about this company.  They actually have someone on standby that speaks Spanish,  just in case, like, some Spanish people get through and start cursing.  Yeah.  So, you know.  I speak Spanish, too.  I claim Spanish as a fourth language, so I can wrap up.  Eventually, thanks to the FCC,  we're going to have a whole office filled with every language possible to make sure everything. 
[01:08:00]  Just in case.  Make sure it's a safe broadcast.  You've got to have a safe broadcast,  because the kids might hear a curse on the way to school.  You perish the thought some child hears a Yugoslavian word.  That's what's so stupid about morning radio.  This is the time where the kids are supervised.  This is the only time kids are supervised, in the morning.  Or they're at school already.  Well, I'll just call back on XM then,  and for the parents that let their kids listen to XM.  Then let's fly.  All right.  We look forward to you cursing over there later this morning, all right? 
[01:08:30]  Thanks, guys.  The ONA Travel Environment is coming to Cleveland.  September 23rd, Tower City Amphitheater.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow through Ticketmaster.  All the info is up on opiananthony.com as well.  But we've got Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, Bill Burr, and Patrice O'Neill.  Coming to town, as well as Anthony and I and all the freaks and people you know and love from this show, okay?  It's going to be a lot of fun.  And then we've got to say hi to Rick in Massachusetts real fast here.  Rick.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  I just thought you and the Pets would like to know that Hillman will be doing an appearance on Saturday, August 5th in Gloucester, Massachusetts at the Consumer Auto Park. 
[01:09:00]  He'll be conducting a bikini car wash with Miss Mantown.  Miss Mantown?  What's his name?  I don't know.  James Gums.  James Gums.  Where's your Frederica Bimmel?  Any Pets have some dirty cars, they might want to go up there.  Yeah, this is the show that's beating us in Boston still. 
[01:09:30]  We made some headway, but the Mantown show is still beating us.  Thanks, Boston.  Yeah.  Thanks for the help.  Boston.  That should have been the easiest radio battle ever, but it's going to take a little more time.  We thought we could beat the Mantown show in 60 days.  Stupid us.  All right.  We started this yesterday.  We've got to get back into it.  That running gun battle there that's on the news this morning.  What happened?  They're showing it on all the news things.  It's a cop, I guess, pulled over a pickup truck with a couple of guys in it, confronts him. 
[01:10:00]  Passenger gets out and just point blank right at the cop's chest.  Boom.  Shoots.  I guess the cop's okay, though.  Yeah.  And then just both of them, yeah, the driver and the passenger, then just started unloading on the cop.  Oof.  Vicious.  Guys in pickup trucks.  Yeah.  Got to watch out.  Yeah, great.  Now they're doing some stunt.  Why are they shooting paintballs at a car? 
[01:10:30]  At a car.  Man, they're showing a cop video.  Because it's WB11 news.  Well, they also had a chimp playing poker this morning.  Yeah, they had a chimpanzee playing poker, which was just adorable.  Attention, WB11 in New York.  World War III has begun.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  World War III.  Has begun.  Let's have a chimp play poker instead.  Yeah.  Because we can't do that type of heavy lifting over there.  Every other station has somebody in Lebanon, somebody in Israel. 
[01:11:00]  But WB has a group of people around a table playing poker with a chimpanzee.  And it was so cute because the chimps started throwing the chips.  It was hysterical.  It was unbelievable.  I didn't expect that whatsoever.  There's nothing cuter than a chimp dressed like real people.  Yep.  In a little hat.  And nothing cuter when they're dressed in an engineer uniform.  Yes.  Like they're just going to drive a train.  Oh, adorable.  But they're really not. 
[01:11:30]  Of course they're not.  Chew off one of your toes.  How angry would they be?  They'd be crashing into other trains because they don't know how the switches work.  But it would be the cutest train wreck ever.  All right.  Here we go.  Chimps.  We started this yesterday, and we only got through 30 seconds of the show.  30 seconds, and then the show ended.  Damn it.  Dr. Ian Smith, I don't know if you're going to love this one.  Well, it's a little boogie.  I don't know if you have the sense of humor, either.  I'm open-minded.  Come on.  I don't know if you have the cruel sense of humor.  I think your doctor ethics will keep you from finding this humor. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, I think so, too.  That's what I think.  There could be a nice contrast here.  Yeah.  Because we love this stuff.  It's cruel, and we can't help but laugh.  Now, a lot of people see this as exploitation on our part, which it is.  We're exploiting audio for our program.  Right.  That's what we do.  But it is purely exploitation of the station that hired this woman as a gimmick.  It is a gimmick.  There is no real need to hire her as a reporter when she is very hard to understand. 
[01:12:30]  That should be a prerequisite of being a television news reporter.  It is that you can speak clearly, and people will understand you.  Just because you're handicapped doesn't mean you're the one that has to do the handicapped stories.  But that's what they did.  And sometimes it's a guy in a wheelchair.  We had that guy in New York.  I don't know.  I haven't seen a blind guy yet.  That would be interesting.  I'm standing next to a tree. 
[01:13:00]  Get by the building.  We're supposed to be talking about.  But they got a deaf girl, which is fine, but you really can't understand her.  It's distracting from the story, and it's purely gimmick, and it's exploitation.  All right.  So her name is Karen Meyer.  I guess she's pretty famous up there in Chicago.  ABC TV.  ABC TV.  Huh?  Did I preface it well enough to keep us out of trouble?  Yeah, I'm hoping.  I doubt it.  Karen Meyer is a deaf reporter on ABC 7 Chicago.  What?  And she only reports disability issues. 
[01:13:30]  That's her job.  If she's so good, why don't they give her the other stories?  Yeah.  She's a genuine reporter.  What?  What?  So she does a report on Tourette's syndrome, and we started this yesterday by trying to  guess when she starts talking.  Yeah, because you get the intro from one reporter, so you guess at home.  It's your job to guess when the deaf reporter starts in.  Listen closely.  Here we go.  We're going to try this again. 
[01:14:00]  It's estimated that every school in America is likely to have at least one child with Tourette's  syndrome, and these children are often misunderstood.  ABC 7's Karen Meyer joins us with more about that.  Karen?  I'm going to tell you.  Sophia?  Tourette's syndrome is a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  It's a new life.  All right, listen.  There's something wrong with the tape.  It's not playing right.  Yeah.  Did you slow that down? 
[01:14:30]  All right, listen.  We're going to try to...  Play it backwards?  We're going to try to play it through, finally.  That's like the third time we've...  We've started this tape.  Yeah, let's see if you can really understand what she's saying.  She has like a...  A sing-song delivery or something.  da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  I have a deaf person reporting about Tourette?  Tourette's.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Tourette's wouldn't even bother her.  That isn't begging to be made fun of.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, come on, you guys.  She can't hear us.  Come on.  She's a fool. 
[01:15:00]  It's estimated that every school in America is likely to have at least one child with Tourette's Syndrome.  And these children are often misunderstood.  ABC 7's Karen Meyer joins us with more about that.  Karen?  I don't know.  Sophia?  The reporter's misunderstood.  I heard her say the names of the reporters.  Thank you, Tobias.  Was it thank you, Sophia?  Or did she say both reporters' names or something?  I think she said it.  I don't know.  Or I'm sitting on a sofa.  What did she say?  With more about that, Karen?  I don't know.  Sophia?  Yeah, Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological disorder.  That is cute, right? 
[01:15:30]  Bye.  All right, what'd she say?  I heard Tourette's Syndrome.  Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological disorder.  And then she lost me.  That causes you to talk like you have marbles in your mouth and you're a sing-song ass.  You heard that?  Wow, Jimmy's good.  Yeah, I picked that up.  It's hard to tell, but I hear very well.  I heard Tourette's Syndrome, and that's when she lost me.  It's a neurological disorder.  You heard?  I heard neurological disorder.  Okay.  That causes you to hear things, like all sound is being filtered through a garbage bag of socks. 
[01:16:00]  Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological disorder that is characterized by involuntary ticked and repeated vocalization.  The answer to the disorder occurs before the age of 18.  If they ask me why I'm doing some of the weird things I do, I'll just tell them that I have Tourette's and explain what it is.  What to do during the mid to late 18th.  My 14-year-old, Ma'am Fister, is finishing up her freshman year at Wheaton Warrenville South High School. 
[01:16:30]  Her tics are not always noticeable.  Sometimes, when I'm waiting in line at anything like amusement parks, I have a leg-kicking tick, and it gets hard because I start kicking people on accident.  She does have trouble writing.  When I'm at school, instead of writing, I can use a keyboard because it is hard for me to write because of the stress.  And also, I'm given extra time to take tests. 
[01:17:00]  Is she unfunny at stand-up?  No, she's not Kathy Buckley.  Let's say hi to Mary in New York.  Hi.  Mary.  I love you guys.  I think you guys make me laugh.  I drive around in my car all day.  I'm a home phlebotomist.  You're a what?  She's a home phlebotomist.  She draws blood at people's homes.  She goes around homes sucking blood.  What are you, a vampire? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, a vampire.  What a ghoul.  Yes, that's me.  I am a phlebotomist.  Let's shoot this.  Wait, how did you decide to become a phlebotomist?  Well, actually, I have a thing for vampires.  No, but...  You're a card.  No, no, no, no.  For real.  No, no, no, no, no.  I really want to hear the deaf girl say phlebotomist.  If she gets it wrong, you hit her.  My, my, my, my.  I'm sorry?  Just say what you want to say. 
[01:18:00]  No, phlebotomist.  I wanted to say that I didn't know that Cartman from South Park was doing news that he was a real character.  Do you know...  We'll ignore that.  Do you know that...  I was arrested once and I was thrown in jail and a larger man phlebotomized me.  Thank you, Mary.  Was that a joke she was saying?  Yes, it was.  It was a cute joke.  But it was a good one.  It was like a Trojan horse surrounded by boring things.  We like phone calls like that.  It just proves we really don't have to try too hard on this show. 
[01:18:30]  I didn't know you could be a home phlebotomist.  Go back to phlebotomy.  Phlebotomist at home.  They go through...  Well, phlebotomy is when they go through your skull and remove the funny part of your brain.  All right, here we go.  Mental phlebotomy.  More about the Tourette's girl.  Leanne was diagnosed with Tourette at the age of two and a half.  Her mom's doos and dad just started with an eye blitz.  Why does she have to lisp?  Does she lisps?  She lisps, too?  Oh, boy.  That's tough.  She's bugging me. 
[01:19:00]  That is rough.  But if you have a lisp, why would you take care of that?  Who cares?  Think about it, though.  If you couldn't hear anything...  Because you're bad enough when you put those goddamn headphones on and you play the music  and someone asks you something.  Yeah!  No, we'll do it tomorrow!  You instantly start talking like that.  That's my favorite thing to do when Oprah's bothering me in the airport.  Oh, yeah.  I become a guy who doesn't know he's talking too loud with the headphones on, fella.  Yeah, because Jimmy always puts his headphones on even in the airport before you even get on the plane.  So it's great just to talk really loud. 
[01:19:30]  And he's got the old school headphones, by the way.  Yeah, very big.  Really big.  So then anything he says, he's in the airport.  There's, you hungry?  You want to get something to eat?  You want to grab some food or something?  And it's just embarrassing.  Her whole life is like that.  People get so pissed.  The doctor said that it was a nervous tick, but then it just kind of spread.  The tick spread down the body. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Do you want to continue or you want to move on to another one?  We got a few others from her.  A few other stories?  Yeah, well, she's the star of the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, we can make fun of that another day.  We want to make fun of the deaf reporter today.  Yeah, we're right now going after the hearing impaired.  Right.  I knew it.  Twitter, dun, dun, dun.  Are you?  Someone on the instant feedback is saying they know exactly what she's saying, actually.  In a God of the V. 
[01:20:30]  Story about animals with disabilities.  So you got the deaf reporter.  Oh, disability.  All right, already.  Animals.  They get it.  You're disabled and that's all you talk about at parties.  Doing a story about animals with disabilities.  They do know that dog.  No, I didn't know that.  Here we go.  This one could be a little better.  Hosting, Sophia.  Yes, it is almost impossible for animals with disabilities to survive in nature.  The book for your zoo is an ideal safe haven for these animals. 
[01:21:00]  What?  I believe it's impossible for disabled animals, animals with disabilities, to survive in nature.  And this zoo is a perfect place for them.  She can't be doing well in Chicago.  It takes too much effort to try to figure out what she's saying.  I'd watch it all the time, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, anything.  And I'm sorry.  It is like a freak show.  It's kind of, you know, it's a freak show.  There was a guy on the news, you know, with half a head. 
[01:21:30]  Wouldn't you watch him?  Oh, yeah.  Watched a half a head guy last night?  Oh, yeah.  A half a head guy kicks ass.  She should do all the headlines.  And with her, she'd be a really impatient, old, loud guy who's always going, just talking  loud until she looks.  What?  I can't hear.  With those big, old hearing aids.  What is she saying?  You would watch every day.  The point we're making is they're exploiting her.  That's right.  Yeah, they certainly are.  Like we're not. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, no.  We, but the difference is we admit it.  Exactly.  Like you said earlier, while I'm saying, I'm just reiterating what you said, that the  only reason she's on is because it's a freak show.  Yeah, and they know that that'll bring in some viewership.  All right, back to the story about animals with disabilities.  I was saying, Sophia, it is almost impossible for animals with disabilities to survive in  nature.  The book feels you can't see our safe havens for these animals.  So this is Harley. 
[01:22:30]  Woof.  Woof.  That's a deaf dog.  Meow.  No.  Woof.  Woof.  Come here, boy.  Come here, boy.  Just sits there and starves to death.  Come here, boy.  Come here, boy.  Stupid dog.  Nothing.  Not a thing.  Ear doesn't even twitch.  Fetch.  He just sees the paper go over his head and he doesn't know what to do with it.  He just looks at it.  Why'd you throw it?  Why'd you throw the paper over my head? 
[01:23:00]  Forget it.  Man's best burden.  Exactly.  Oh, the first time you walk in, it just darts out in traffic, gets its head clipped by a  Buick.  Now it's handicapped because it's got no head.  I'm trending, Tommy.  I'm a dog with another hand that went down.  I don't know what animals could be, uh, have disabilities.  I'm not handicapped.  I didn't know animals could have disabilities.  They're not.  Because I thought nature took care of all that.  They're broken.  Because they're, you know, they're smart. 
[01:23:30]  You know, not like us humans.  We have to save everything.  Yeah, we're, we're, we're, humans are disabled.  Animals are busted.  They're broken.  And they don't survive.  And you don't, you, you, you, you gotta gas them or something.  You do what you do.  We, as humans, have too much love in our heart.  We gotta save everything.  Don't we?  He was on a beach in Sausalito, and being deaf, he could not hear the public approaching him,  which is not safe for either himself or for the public. 
[01:24:00]  Wait, what animal's deaf?  What was it?  What kind of animal was deaf?  Did we miss that?  I don't know.  It's not a dog.  What is it?  I don't think.  Is it a sparrow?  Is it a dolphin?  I don't know.  Let's go back a couple seconds here and see if we can figure this out.  Three years ago, how was it?  What is that, robot?  A deaf sea lion came to put beer through from California.  A sea lion?  He was on a beach in Sausalito, and being deaf, he could not hear the public approaching him, 
[01:24:30]  which is not safe for either himself or for the public.  Well, what animal's deaf there, Danny?  A sea lion.  A sea lion?  Yeah, it's a sea lion.  I tried to chop it down a little because there was too much of the other reporter talking,  so I just wanted to hear it.  You could hear her say it there.  It's very like...  A deaf sea lion?  Sea lion.  She's doing a story about a deaf sea lion?  Because she's deaf.  I hate sea lions.  They're just so punchable.  How do you not punch a sea lion when you see it? 
[01:25:00]  They're adorable when they're little.  Exactly.  Then they grow up into those big, oafish-looking things.  More importantly, you don't know where to punch it.  Yeah, it's just...  It's like...  Big, roly-poly, fat thing.  What's the swimming slug with the mustache?  Yeah, oversized slug with little flippers and a mustache.  With a Joel Siegel mustache.  Big, fat slug walking out of a movie premiere.  Well, guys, the next story, we're just about done here.  She does a story on the female gorilla that has arthritis. 
[01:25:30]  Stop it.  They also said the gorilla had blackberry thumb.  Stupid is this story.  A eight-pound, beta, 45-year-old female gorilla has osteoarthritis in her hip.  That resulted in a hip replacement surgery.  So she has artificial hips on both sides.  She also has severe spondylosis, which means that her spinal cord is essentially fused and is a solid rod. 
[01:26:00]  We're all set on exhibit.  Schoolkeeper Greg Dimitro says they developed a physical therapy program for her.  Physical therapy, hip replacements, spine surgery.  It's like...  And every day, we pass a homeless guy on our walk...  Yeah.  ...whose legs are ready to rot off his body.  Yeah.  Yet a gorilla gets millions of dollars of surgery.  Exactly.  And can't even say thank you.  No.  Stupid thing pets are kittens every paper. 
[01:26:30]  It would eat your face, given the opportunity.  If the thing was able to talk, it would probably tell us it just wants to die.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  You know what?  I'm a wreck.  Just let me go.  I'm a gorilla.  I'm a gorilla.  We're animals.  We realize the sensibility in just saying, enough is enough.  Don't replace my hips.  And animals don't have filters, so you got to think the rest of the gorillas are just  making fun of the gorilla, of course.  With arthritis.  The first thing they do is for its food, they just start to bite its hip replacement area. 
[01:27:00]  They bite its hips.  That's just instinctive.  Yeah.  They smell that a human was there.  Yeah.  Just bite its hips.  Oh.  Here's her outro.  Karen Meyer, the deaf reporter from Chicago.  How funny would that be?  Just pulls out its stainless steel hip and throws it at its head.  Let me guess what her outro is.  Okay.  And we are.  We are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Going back to the studio.  Matt and the young.  What?  Which is not so bad. 
[01:27:30]  If you want to meet these wonderful animals, the Brookfield Zoo is located off of First Avenue  between the Stevenson and Eisenhower Expressway.  Good directions.  The zoo is open every day of the year.  I'm in Guam.  Isn't that amazing?  What happened?  That's amazing what they could do.  Oh, and the reporter's got it.  That's amazing what they could do.  Are you talking about her?  Yeah, that's...  That guy's my friend.  I know that guy.  Deaf people.  Oh, really?  Jose Sanders.  Oh, really?  You know everyone.  WLS, Chicago. 
[01:28:00]  Did you sleep with him, you faggot?  Hey!  Hey, come on.  Teasing, of course.  Stupid news.  I'm a friend of the show.  I know.  That's why we...  Kick you.  We tease because we love...  Thank you.  Kick me where it counts.  Yeah.  All right, we'll have more of that fine reporter in the coming weeks.  What do you got?  Please.  Oh, really?  Can we do...  Oh, no, we're late.  All right, we'll do that after the break.  We got audio of the poker-playing monkey from WB11 we were just talking about. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, goody.  We also got...  Who do we got from Clerks 2?  E-Rock?  Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran.  Jeff and Brian?  Yeah.  Nice.  The two main characters in the clip, too.  Look at that.  JB.  All right, they'll be joining the program next.  Also, we have to take a peek at Noah's Ark.  Oh, that's the...  From the Logo Channel.  The Logo Channel.  A couple of the boys had to watch the Gay Channel last night. 
[01:29:00]  The Logo.  And Noah's Ark is a series about four black gay guys.  Yeah.  We got a little audio.  They're very different.  We got a little taste.  They're very different.  One is very light.  One's very dark.  And then in between are, like, varying shades.  Yeah.  And then they go out and they have gay sex.  And they talk about it.  So that's like...  What do you got?  Season one on DVD?  It's like Sex and the City.  I saw the trailer for it when I was watching...  What the hell was it? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, the GLAAD Awards.  I was watching the GLAAD Awards.  And watching, like, Michael Douglas come up to present something.  The most nervous I've ever seen him in my life.  Because you just know Michael Douglas is probably throwing out some jokes at some parties.  You know, maybe some gay jokes, some racial jokes.  Just seems like the type to me.  Yeah.  Especially after that golf course incident that was rumored. 
[01:30:00]  What did he say to that guy?  He hit him with a golf club, right?  Yeah, he teed off and he hit a caddy in the groin.  And he went, oh, I hit the N right in the nuts.  Did he say that?  Yeah.  He said that?  Michael Douglas?  Yeah, so the caddy sued him.  And I don't know what the result was.  But it was rumored that he had said that.  So if he did, then I wouldn't put it past him that he would have... 
[01:30:30]  Like, you don't think gays are saying crazy stuff about blacks and other people?  About straight guys?  Look at where they put it.  That's silly.  Yeah.  She lays on her back?  All right.  We've got to step aside for a minute here.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Call the O.P. and Anthony show right now.  866-313-3.  O&A, who's this?  It's O.P. and Anthony. 
[01:31:00]  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So why'd you call?  The Lummy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the O.P. and Anthony show at 866-313-FREE.  Hello?  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[01:31:30]  The O.P. and Anthony show.  What, are you taking a dump?  They said we had two minutes, so I went to take a leak.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We've got a very busy show.  Dr. Ian Smith in studio.  Also, I just want to say Dante and Randall.  I'm sure.  I love that.  Skipper and Gilligan. 
[01:32:00]  That's how I know you.  That's how anyone knows us.  I mean, it's Brian and Jeff, but no, it's Dante and Randall from Clerks, too.  Before we talk to those guys, we've got Donald Trump in a limo somewhere.  Donald.  Good morning.  How are you, sir?  How are you?  I hear your show is doing really well.  We're doing all right so far, yes.  So now we get a little wrecking.  Red, where your show is really doing well.  That's good.  That's a tough act to follow, although the last act wasn't so tough to follow. 
[01:32:30]  Hey, you know better than anyone, it's better to follow the guy that followed the guy than  to follow the guy.  Absolutely.  So you're going to be nicer?  Much easier.  Are you going to be nicer to us this time?  I'm always nice to you.  Last time you took a few shots at us about Howard and all that.  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  I would never do that.  We understand, Donald, until, you know, someone's...  Well, Howard's a great friend of mine.  I know.  The wedding, the whole deal.  Will we be invited to a Trump wedding when this one goes down the crapper?  Of course.  Do you have any doubt about that? 
[01:33:00]  So where are we today?  You're on the New Jersey Turnpike?  Well, actually, no.  I'm in my office.  Oh.  And I'm calling about the Miss Universe contest, which is on at Sunday night on NBC at 9 o'clock.  Yeah, we were excited because we thought we were going to get you in the limo on the  way down to Atlantic City.  Donald, what...  That would be one way to do it.  What planets are involved this year?  What, who?  What planets are involved this year, since it is Miss Universe?  All planets.  Just about all of them.  How can we never get any representation from any other planet but Earth? 
[01:33:30]  Do we truly have the most beautiful women in the universe?  Well, we really do.  I think so.  I think we really do.  And these women are really beautiful.  And that's one of the reasons it does so well on television is because of the beauty.  You know, Miss America went off network television, which was sad, actually.  But we have the women that are beautiful.  And I've always said, you know, forget the stage.  Just give beautiful women.  And when I bought it seven years ago, it was doing okay, but not great at all.  And we have sort of elevated the women and cut out the stage. 
[01:34:00]  Now, Donald, Miss America, you have any involvement in that still?  No, I don't.  I own Miss USA and Miss Universe.  Okay.  Now, what the thing is, the thing about Miss America that kind of sucks is that it's too  politically correct.  They try to make it like it's a pageant about, you know, the personality and all that crap.  How intelligent they are and all that.  Now, we want to see these girls in as little as possible.  And I think, are you bringing that with Miss Universe?  Well, we definitely do. 
[01:34:30]  You know, one of the things that I got into a little trouble with, I said, they said, how  come Miss Universe does so well and Miss America does?  And I said, when I bought it, I made the bathing suits smaller and the heels higher.  See?  And, you know, Miss America actually made the bathing suits larger and they said women  aren't allowed to wear heels for a while.  You know, they weren't allowed to wear high heels.  What are they thinking?  I don't know what it is, but if you've ever seen a woman's leg with a high heel and without,  they just look better.  They look sleeker.  They look nicer.  Donald knows.  Yeah.  It gives them the calf muscle. 
[01:35:00]  I believe they am a professional.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a smart man, sir.  And what happened is with Miss America, they said they couldn't even wear high heels.  And you know what happened also?  The audience disappeared.  Yeah, they went away.  Boy, I tell you, you don't have to be a genius to figure that one out.  They'd like to think it's all about the speeches they give on how they want to save the world  or, you know, the talent, girl juggling, something like that.  We want to see, like, really small bikinis and girls around.  Show us your ass.  Yeah, nice ass.  Because when they did have the swimsuit thing and it was like the big bloomers type bottoms on 
[01:35:30]  the girls, they turn around for the walk away and you're just zoomed in on that ass looking  to see if there's any cottage cheese.  We didn't even see the ass because the suit was so big, actually.  Yeah.  So you really didn't know exactly.  I think next year's Miss America pageant, they're going back to the one-piece stripes,  like back in the 20s, the steel pier.  That's right.  You should have a wet t-shirt contest or something.  Donald's working it in.  I'm sure he is.  Our bathing suits are so small that we were forced to call them thongs, but NBC said,  look, this is getting ridiculous. 
[01:36:00]  So we had to make them a tiny little bit larger.  Oh, I thought they were talking about your pay.  Yeah, the girls are really beautiful.  You hose them down.  Let's just start hosing the women down.  Will the network go for this?  Mud wrestling.  You know, I love Donald Trump.  Well, we had mud wrestling on Miss Universe, which is a great idea.  Nobody suggested that.  I think we're going to do it.  I don't know if it's too late, but next year I guarantee it.  Throw up a couple of bucks.  You're rich, right?  I've heard.  I've heard you have a couple of bucks.  What are you saying, Dr. Ian Smith?  This guy's a master promoter. 
[01:36:30]  Here he is, a real estate icon, and he's in the morning at 8, 10, on the phone talking  about Miss Universe.  This guy, I love this guy.  What time do you get up, Donald?  Probably 5.  5?  Yeah, I get up at 5.  Well, I don't sleep long hours.  I sleep only 3 hours.  Now with that wife.  It's like a big deal.  You know, 8 o'clock in the morning is like half the day, right?  Of course not.  I like that.  Do you spoon with your wife?  Well, the way I look at it, you know, if we took a commercial.  It's not answering me.  I want to know if he spoons.  Picture that. 
[01:37:00]  Go ahead, Donald.  If I took a commercial for this show, it would cost a lot of money.  If I talk to you guys about Miss Universe, it would cost me nothing.  So, I mean, it makes sense.  He's a smart guy, see?  Very smart businessman.  That's how you've made a fortune.  All right, Donald.  Good talking to you.  You're a very great guy, and we'll watch your great show.  Well, thanks a lot.  I want to see almost nude girls.  Have you changed the diaper yet?  We asked you that last time.  No, I tell you, I haven't yet.  I would do it, but I have a wife that likes doing it, and so far she hasn't asked me to do it, but I would do it. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, that's how it goes down.  It's not like you're showing her a bank account or something.  No, it's just the fact that, you know what, she's great.  And I do it 100%, but so far I haven't been called on that.  Yeah, tell the plumber from Staten Island that's how you do it.  You find someone that loves doing it.  Oh, my wife loves it.  Yeah, right.  All women like handling that crap.  Sure, why not?  All right.  Show's on when tonight?  Donald's very busy, man. 
[01:38:00]  When is it on, Donald?  It's on Sunday night at 9 o'clock, and I'm going to go there.  I'm leaving in about two hours for Los Angeles, and it's from Los Angeles, live from Los Angeles.  The Trump jet?  The Trump jet?  Yes.  You take over there?  Yeah.  You fly it yourself?  I'm actually heading back to L.A. today.  Can I hitch a ride?  I wouldn't mind at all.  That'd be great.  Thank you, sir.  If you want a ride, you hop on the plane.  We got one of the stars from Clerks 2.  One of the stars from Clerks 2 just asked that.  Randall.  Plays Randall in the movie, I should say.  It's playing on the plane.  Over. 
[01:38:30]  On the Trump plane.  He's got a bootleg copy.  It'll be about four hours of talking about mud wrestling.  I think it's a great idea.  I think we'll do it definitely for next year.  Do you have a talent competition?  I don't even know.  No, we don't have.  You know what the talent is?  Beauty.  I did that once before.  Parade hot chicks around.  Hot chicks.  Hot outfits.  Donald knows.  The whole talent is about beauty.  Turn up the A.C. and see what happens.  And see what pops.  You're not going to see anybody playing the piano.  You should give them a microphone.  Every time they try to talk, a voice comes over the loudspeaker and just goes, 
[01:39:00]  shut up.  At least not playing the piano with their hands.  Yeah.  It really is.  It's good.  It's been really a lot of fun and it's become very successful from a rating standpoint.  And NBC loves me very much, primarily because of The Apprentice.  Of course.  I don't know if you saw The Apprentice finish number two three weeks ago.  Yeah, congratulations on that.  It continues to do great numbers and it's an amazing show.  And that's attributed to you, Donald.  Excuse me?  And that's attributed to you.  Well, you know, they thought maybe Martha could take a crack at it and that didn't work 
[01:39:30]  out so well.  No, it didn't.  Whoa, you're still going to Mark?  Yeah, you two took a couple of jams at each other.  You know, we've had 15 copies of The Apprentice and every one of them failed.  Mark Cuban, Richard Branson, Martha, Tommy Hilfiger, every one of them failed.  So I'm starting to think that maybe I do it properly.  Who knows?  It's like you guys on radio.  You know, you do things properly.  Look at the compliment we get.  Now we get the compliment.  That's nice.  Donald, let me ask you a question.  Is there anything you don't do well?  Other than staying marriages, but anything you don't do well? 
[01:40:00]  Well, I'd like to play golf better.  Okay, all right.  All right.  I'll give you that.  That is a perfect answer for him.  If I play okay, but I'd like to play it better, everybody would.  What's your handicap?  Four.  Is it really?  Yeah, but you guys, you know, you get to kick the ball out of the rough and stuff.  He's got someone out there that really went after the ball and kicks it.  Come on.  Spalding.  Yeah, he's got the perfect foursome.  That's a gimme.  But, Donald, it's a 12-foot putt.  That's right.  That's right. 
[01:40:30]  I'll pick that up.  Tiger Woods is kicking ass at the British Open today.  He's doing well.  Yeah, he's doing very well today.  He's doing well.  Yeah, he sank a 205-yard shot.  Did he really?  Yep.  He got a two on a par four.  He sank a shot 205 yards from the fairway.  Can you believe it?  That was today?  So he's leading.  Yeah, he's leading right now.  I'm just looking at the screen.  He's leading right now by two strokes.  He's 11 under par.  11 under?  Wow.  And Chris DeMarco, obviously you're a fan, huh?  Dr. Ian.  Are you a golfer?  I played your course before.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, with George Ross. 
[01:41:00]  How did you like it?  I loved it.  You kidding?  I loved that waterfall hole.  Yeah, I read about your course.  We'd like to invite someday, Donald.  Anytime you want, you call my office and absolutely you're there, okay?  The greens are just lined with money.  How did you play it with George Ross?  There's a little age difference.  How did you play it with George Ross?  Listen, you know the old guys, they hit it.  They don't hit it long, but they hit it straight as an arrow.  That's right.  You know, so George is, you know, he's a friend of a friend.  And, you know, George, by the way, is the guy from the practice.  Well, you know what you do?  You call up my office and I'll get you on there.  That's a great course.  It's the one in Trump National in Westchester. 
[01:41:30]  Is that the one where it has a waterfall that's how high or something?  It's 105 feet high.  And it throws about 10,000 gallons a minute.  Donald, is it restricted?  He's black.  Totally not restricted.  Okay.  Just making sure.  Well, we'll find out after we get him off the radio.  If I said it was restricted, we'd end up tomorrow front page New York Post.  Well, that's true.  Well, let's go with it.  Let's do a headline together.  Because we could really use the press.  Yeah, we could use a little help here.  Donald Trump reveals restricted. 
[01:42:00]  And we don't want the Irish.  Except for Dr. Ian.  He's got about as good of a shot of getting on that golf course as I do getting on that plane.  Ain't going to happen.  I'm going to call Donald.  These guys are fooling around.  I'm serious.  I'm going to call.  You call up the office.  I'd love to have you play.  You're allowed on the golf course as long as you know how to, you know, carry a bag.  You have reached the offices of Donald Trump.  Please leave a message.  All right, Donald.  All right, man.  We know you're a busy man.  You know, congrats.  We're going to congratulate you on all your stuff. 
[01:42:30]  I know.  That's ridiculous.  Please.  Miss Universe Sunday, right?  Sunday at 9 o'clock on NBC.  Oh, really fast, too?  We might have a Freedom Tower soon, huh?  Tell me about that.  Yeah, he's not happy about that.  I know he's not.  Donald wanted the towers back the way they were, a little taller, and yeah, I think everybody  did.  They made a big mistake.  They're building this ugly building, and it's so stupid, and nobody's going to occupy  it anyway.  That's the one thing I would say.  But I would have said if they were going to do it, they should have built the World Trade  Center exactly as they were, but stronger and slightly taller. 
[01:43:00]  And with apartments that you can sell.  That's true.  Donald, we just don't have balls anymore.  We don't have balls as a country.  It was so obvious to just rebuild it.  Isn't it stupid?  Isn't it stupid what they're doing?  They're building a building that's not a good-looking building.  No.  It's one building instead of two.  If you rebuilt the same building, slightly taller, stronger and slightly taller, but the  exact same building, people would have said, we won.  That's right.  Now, they won.  We're building one building, and it's a bad-looking building at that. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, the design's awful.  It doesn't make sense.  You know, I did this, and I announced this like a year ago, that this is what they should  do.  I don't think I've ever, since the Wallman Rink, since I built the Wallman Rink, I've never  done anything that's been more popular, and yet the governor never picked it up for some  reason.  I tell you, he'd be such a popular governor if he picked it up, but nobody picked it up,  and it's just been...  We'd all get behind that.  We'd be like, no way.  They're rebuilding it exactly the, you know, well, you know, but better and stronger materials  and all that crap.  Yeah, the politicians never picked it up, and all they had to do was announce, we're 
[01:44:00]  rebuilding the World Trade Center, but it's going to be one story taller, and this thing  would have been so popular.  But these characters are just, it's just disgusting.  You don't have enough of them.  Red tape.  Everybody wanted it.  The New York Post was behind it.  Everybody wanted it.  The letters to the papers were unbelievable, 100% in favor.  Like 100%, there were no negative letters.  Hundreds of letters, there were no negative letters, and they didn't do it.  So, what are you going to do, fellas?  That's why you're doing radio, right? 
[01:44:30]  That's right.  I think so.  Have a good time.  All right, thank you, Donald.  Make sure you watch Miss Universe, and watch mud wrestling.  Mud wrestling.  It will happen.  All right, thanks.  So long.  Donald Trump, everyone.  All right.  Donald.  That was very cool.  Got that guy.  Too much money.  Too much money.  And just, he's silly with his wives, though.  Like, how the hell do you get married that many times?  You know?  And either of you?  Either of you two?  Married?  No.  No?  I was.  You were?  I was.  Me too. 
[01:45:00]  She take you?  There was nothing to take.  No, it was before or after, Clerks?  After, but there was still nothing.  There was still nothing, yeah.  That's the oddest thing about, like, you.  Now, I've seen you.  You've popped up every so often.  I was going to just curse for that clown movie.  I can't even look at you, man.  No, it is hysterical, man.  It is hysterical.  Vulgar.  Vulgar, man.  I can't even look at him.  I know it's a movie, but holy crap.  People have trashed it, and I find it one of the most entertaining, funniest goddamn movies. 
[01:45:30]  It is deeply disturbing.  I have so many questions on this press tour about that movie, then even Clerks 2.  Really?  Yeah.  Because they were like, how did you do Clerks 2 and the vulgarities?  I'm like, I did Vulgar, for God's sakes.  Vulgar.  When you're doing a movie about a transvestite clown that gets gang raped by three people,  three men, one of which is Ethan Supley, before he got his big fame with Earl, I mean, it  was just like, what else couldn't I do?  It was like one shade from porn, almost. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  You were ahead of that Brokeback curve.  You were.  You were.  Where's my Oscar nod?  Yeah, you got destroyed, man.  Just destroyed.  It was great.  But you had Clerks, and then what did you do?  I disappeared.  Kevin Smith had all kinds of restraining orders.  That was it.  Didn't want you around him anymore.  Did you just get a regular job?  Yeah, it was weird.  After Clerks, I started doing voiceover work, which is odd, because I speak slow and retarded-like. 
[01:46:30]  No, but you have one of those voices.  It's very distinctive.  People really dig it.  Chicks seem to dig it.  Yeah, tell me who.  They seem to dig it, though.  It's very noticeable that it's yours.  I love the flying car thing they did on the, what was it, Leno?  Chey Leno, yeah.  Yeah.  We go around every so often.  And whenever another year ticks away into the thousands, and we realize we're still  driving around, I'll always look at my chick or something and go, where's the flying car? 
[01:47:00]  We were promised that.  Oddly enough, we may have those by the time Clerks 3 comes out.  Did you leave it with an ending where you could actually do Clerks 3?  There is that window there, yeah.  Looks like there's going to be a Clerks 3, because the reviews are really good for Clerks 2.  Yeah.  A bunch of us saw it.  We loved the movie.  We talked about this the other day with Kevin Smith.  I want to know, it's a personal question, but how much money did you guys make for Clerks?  The first one?  Yeah.  I'm still waiting for the check.  Nothing. 
[01:47:30]  Exactly, nothing.  There was no contracts.  There was no SAG.  Nothing.  It was just like a bunch of dopey friends getting together with a camera.  But Kevin didn't kind of sneak a check in the mail, like, hey, thanks.  He did.  He did.  That's all I want to know.  Because he seems like he's that type of guy.  You know how many people do that, though?  You don't have a contract, but, guys.  It covered my groceries for about a week.  You know how many people, though, do that?  Like, friends get together, make a movie, and it just ends up on, you know, the web.  The web wasn't really available back then or anything, but, I mean, they do that, and  it just becomes nothing. 
[01:48:00]  It's the same thing, only this became, like, a cult hit.  Yeah, I have over 50 film credits.  50 film credits.  No one has seen them.  No one's seen any of them.  I do King Lear in my living room, and kill.  Kill every night.  No one knows.  Ten years later, you come back.  Were you a little leery about coming back?  To say the least.  Yeah?  Yeah.  This guy was.  I wasn't easily convinced to do it.  You know, I've been doing so many other things.  I couldn't quite squeeze it in. 
[01:48:30]  I'm like, I don't know what day.  Was it hard, though, because, like, character-wise, I mean, is it really, because, is that you?  Yeah, because these characters are so intense.  It's hard.  I need years to figure it out.  Well, you know what it is, they're very, very likable.  I mean, they're very likable characters and stuff, and relatable and stuff.  So, was that really you, or did you have to act?  I mean, I can't act, right?  It must be me.  That was you?  That explains the last 10 years.  Of no more credits, and then, no, actually, you made a movie, though. 
[01:49:00]  I did.  I wrote and directed a movie.  Now you know it comes out, and the Weinstein Company's putting it out in December.  Those Weinsteins, huh?  Those Weinsteins.  Nice.  That's who you want to be, your friends, right there.  And, yeah, doing very well, the clerks, too, in the reviews, which is good, because that  kind of gets you.  We were talking earlier, off-mic, about message boards and stuff, and how Kevin hates message  boards, doesn't like negative message board posts.  So, he's made his own message board you've got to pay for. 
[01:49:30]  Do you guys check out what people are saying on message boards and stuff?  I'm too busy with porn.  Porn on the computer?  Yeah, just like our Jimmy Norton.  We've got to look carried away.  I've got to interrupt.  Joel Siegel just reviewed Clerks 2.  You guys want to hear it?  Let's hear it.  I have no idea what he said, okay?  I swear to you, I'm not setting you guys up.  It could be good.  It could be bad.  I have no idea.  What?  He was just on.  He was just on.  Okay.  Because this has been a saga that's been going on all week.  Well, how do you review a movie? 
[01:50:00]  He only saw 40 minutes.  Yeah, he walked out.  I'm sure he's not going to like it.  And just in talking about a donkey show, he was upset.  Just imagine what would happen if he saw it.  His head would have exploded, and all that would have been left with had been mustache.  Just this mustache and a puddle of goo.  I love the whole movie, but the whole donkey thing, I was thinking to myself, how the hell  did they get away with this?  That was the most puzzling thing.  You know, the reason for the small budget is Kevin wanted to shoot the movie he wanted  to shoot, and we went into it going, we're making an unrated NC-17 movie. 
[01:50:30]  That's what we said.  No, really.  He was stunned that it got an R.  Yeah, I think it was Bring Your Own Bottle Friday at the MPAA.  Either that, or they pulled a Joel Siegel and left after 40 minutes.  I don't know.  Is anyone paying attention in Hollywood?  It wasn't graphic, but just the subject matter.  You know they have problems with that crap in Hollywood.  Well, hasn't he beaten them twice, MPAA?  Yeah.  So they got tired of him kicking their faces, and he just said, give them the R.  The first time, we actually hired Alan Dershowitz to go back in and fight, because the first 
[01:51:00]  clerks was given an NC-17.  This time around, we had him on speed dial, and we didn't need it.  Amazing.  So here's Joel Siegel's review of Clerks 2.  All right.  Just to give you the back history for maybe people that haven't listened a lot this week,  Joel Siegel walked out of the movie after 30, 40 minutes.  Right.  So he saw not even half the movie, and it was the first movie he walked out in 30 effing  years.  Yeah, and made kind of a scene when he walked out.  Made a scene, and then...  And now he gets to give a review.  That's not right.  No, absolutely.  Did he see the whole movie? 
[01:51:30]  Did he go back and see it?  Does Danny know?  I don't think so.  All right.  We'll play the review, and then we'll figure it out.  Nice.  Joel Siegel.  These are not the dog days of summer for Hollywood.  In fact, tonight, Hollywood opening four movies nationwide from Monster Houses to Super  Ex-Girlfriends, four movies.  Joel Siegel here.  You actually saw three of them, didn't you?  Full disclosure.  Yes.  Full disclosure.  I walked out of the first movie I intended to review in almost 30 years.  The movie was Clerks 2. 
[01:52:00]  It made it for the first 40 minutes.  It got so gross.  I couldn't take any more.  I stood up, said, that's it.  Walked out.  I can't recommend Clerks 2, at least not the first 40 minutes.  That's it?  It got so what?  It was just dialogue.  And it wasn't even that graphic, the dialogue.  Gross, rude.  What did he use there?  I think he used the word gross.  Gross.  It was so gross.  Wait a review, though.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to help.  I would see that.  That irrelevant old man.  I would love to see a movie that chased him out of the theater. 
[01:52:30]  People are walking out of offices right now.  They're like, I got to see this.  If that cornball says, I laughed from beginning to end, you should never see the movie because  it's not going to be a funny movie.  That's great that he just walked out.  It was so gross, it should be in the next ad, actually.  But he didn't.  That should be.  You should have that printed and put in.  This was so gross, I walked out.  He's talking about dialogue.  That wasn't that bad.  But he didn't trash the movie, though.  The movie itself is not gross.  He didn't trash it, though.  He just said, I walked out.  It was so gross.  It's not like he said the acting was bad or the story sucked. 
[01:53:00]  He just said, no good.  I'm sure he enjoyed the acting.  You're right.  I would rather say it's so gross than say it was poorly acted or something like that.  They should have that on the poster, I'm telling you right now.  It would help you guys out even more.  Was that it, though?  That was it.  That's the whole review.  As far as the Clerks 2 goes, yeah.  You know, if we were still going out in a press store, they should just replace him with  us.  Yeah.  I think he'd do well, guys.  Oh, I walked out in 40 minutes.  Wow, I got to see this.  Got to see this movie.  All right, we got to take a quick break.  We'll continue with you guys, or you got to go somewhere?  You have nowhere to go, right?  Where do we got to go? 
[01:53:30]  Actually, I got to go meet Donald.  I got to get on that plane.  Right.  Yeah, get on that Trump plane.  All right, more with these guys in just a bit.  O.B. Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, man, we're running out of show. 
[01:54:00]  First half of the show almost over.  We continue on XM Satellite Radio in just a bit here.  Dr. Ian Smith from Celebrity Fit Club in studio.  Hey, boys.  Also a very good friend of Michael Strahan.  The Clarks 2 guys know the story.  We heard you got all broke back. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, that was the rumor.  You're not laughing.  I'm smiling.  You better smile.  We were supposed to go to that big Michael Strahan party.  Yeah, you guys didn't come.  Are you kidding?  We had Bon Jovi.  I never got an invite.  I only talked.  You gave me a casual one.  Like, yeah, come in.  I had it my thing.  I told Opie all the information.  Oh, great.  Opie.  Blame it on me now that these guys didn't get the invite.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You could give him a personal invite.  I'm not taking that crap. 
[01:55:00]  I don't have a cell phone.  I called Opie.  No one does.  These are the details.  You could have the last time you were in here, you could have invited these guys.  Oh, boy.  You were on the list?  Yeah, of course you're on the list.  Plus one.  It's easy to say now.  I bet you weren't on the list.  No, you were on the list.  They were waiting for you.  Norton.  N-O-N.  Check out the Morton.  They make that mistake.  You guys, Opie, that's messed up, man.  Was Bon Jovi nice?  Awesome.  Yeah?  Awesome.  Sambora was just awesome. 
[01:55:30]  That dude was so soft.  Has his fat gut.  Yeah, he needs some fixing up by you.  What a mess he is.  Celebrity fit club for him, you think?  That's awesome.  Did you try to talk him into it?  No, I didn't.  It's like, dude, what do you think?  Did he bring his broad?  His new broad?  She was not there.  We were all looking for her, trust me.  Denise Richards, right?  I think they broke up.  They broke up already?  I think.  No, I don't think so.  I got a microphone in front of me, so I got to be right.  No, you're wrong.  I could say anything and people believe it because I'm on the radio.  We were all looking for her, trust me. 
[01:56:00]  Is he banging Heather Mills now?  Yeah.  That's who he's doing.  A box full of pristine shoes.  Or at least one pristine shoe.  Which one is she missing?  I think the left.  She has the right?  Again, it's Mike.  I don't know.  She could probably now become a reporter in Chicago, apparently.  Doing all missing leg stories.  Only reports on field goals.  You really should get the Charlie Brown DVD and put that deaf reporter against Charlie 
[01:56:30]  Brown.  With the Charlie Brown audio.  Totally.  Totally.  It's her.  It's wah, wah.  It really is.  That sing-songy.  I'm telling you.  That would definitely work.  All these years, we were wondering who that person was.  It was her.  She was actually meant to speak, but they just could never hear her.  It's Dante and Randall from Clerks 2, by the way.  The characters they play.  The characters.  You guys recognize, like, all the time, right?  Gotta be.  Don't even be modest about it.  Oddly enough, I do, but he doesn't. 
[01:57:00]  We were in, we just wound up, like, doing 27 cities in 32 days on this tour, and one  of the cities brought us out to go see the Black Crows in concert, and we're at this amphitheater  in St. Louis, and we're on the beer line, waiting for her to get a beer, and this guy  comes, like, dude, you're Dante from Clerks, right?  I'm like, yeah.  He's like, oh, that's great.  Meanwhile, Jeff's standing right next to me.  He hands the camera to Jeff, like, do you mind taking a photo? 
[01:57:30]  So I took a picture of his nuts.  I'm like, I got it.  There you go.  No, I love that.  You know, it's that whole Clark Kent thing.  I take off the backwards baseball cap.  Nobody knows who that guy is.  I love it.  Yeah, you put on a backwards baseball cap.  Everyone recognizes you, right?  Oh, yeah.  That's odd, man.  Everyone.  Everyone, no?  No.  I assume, like, everyone would, though.  I got an embarrassing photo story from, what the hell's that restaurant in Central Park?  Tavern on the Green?  Thank you.  The hoity-toity one. 
[01:58:00]  I was in there once, and I thought I was being recognized as couples at a table, and they  walked up and said...  And you're prepared to say, well, yes, it is me.  Yeah, the girl goes, would you mind taking a picture?  And I was like, no, not at all.  And she handed me the camera so her and her boyfriend could get a picture in front of  the big Christmas tree.  And the people I was with did nothing but laugh and rag me all day.  Would you mind taking a picture?  And I'm like, yeah, ready to get up? 
[01:58:30]  No problem.  Let me just fix my hair a little bit.  Hey, Moe from Brooklyn has a really good question for Brian.  Ask Brian for his honest initial reaction when he found out he'd be romancing.  Rosario Dawson on screen.  I spent quite a few minutes alone in my room.  Yeah.  Were you just going, how am I going to pull this off?  More like...  That's what he was doing.  More like, how did I not get the Colin Farrell clause in this scene?  You know what I mean?  What was that?  Well, now ask me about my reaction to Brian gets to make out with Rosario. 
[01:59:00]  I'm like, what?  Rosario Dawson in Alexander is completely naked and just banging the hell out of...  Oh, come on.  Your TiVo doesn't have that on there 15 times?  I don't know.  I can't watch titillating things.  Like, oh, a bosom.  I just got to, you know...  Oh, no.  Hardcore.  Oh, no, sir.  It's all.  Yeah, it's pretty...  There's a lot going on there?  No, but what he's talking, he's talking like the German and Japanese movies.  I'm going to see a Roman movie.  It's got to be Caligula.  There's no reason.  You know?  He needs movies where a human's involved. 
[01:59:30]  It looks like a fountain full of pudding.  Just say that.  Leave it at that.  Hopefully that got through.  Look, a bucket of lard.  The name is the people of Rome.  Those are Jimmy's favorite stuff.  Jimmy's a little different.  Yeah, the little titillating scenes in a regular movie.  He laughs at that stuff.  Hey, Bryce, slide the couch back just a little.  Push back just a little.  Well, but not only do I get to make out with Rosario in this film, but also Kevin's real wife. 
[02:00:00]  That's right.  Plays my fiancé in the film.  And so that's kind of odd when your friend slash boss says,  I want you to make out with my wife numerous times while I watch and film you.  Just another day.  That is really odd.  You know, the first couple of takes, I'm like, stop.  Hold on.  Why are we?  Wait, there's no crew here, Kevin.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Pants around his ankles.  We're in your room.  Yeah, when did Dante have this fat, fat house in Hollywood all of a sudden? 
[02:00:30]  Shut up.  Just keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You know how we know that story is false?  You said pants around his ankle.  Kevin never pants.  Three-quarter shorts.  Right.  There you go.  You're alive, Hans.  You made that story up.  Details.  It's all in the details.  Why are you killing me, sir?  Why are you killing me?  Sorry.  You guys have really good chemistry.  Jim, Jim, don't take him out on the road, obviously.  Oh, he's a good boy.  Wait a minute.  Jim and I are going on a pudding hunt.  We certainly are.  He's going to play Proculus, and I'll play Livia. 
[02:01:00]  We're going to get a fight.  Somebody's going to play.  That was last night, wasn't it?  I want to be Proculus.  I don't know.  I had you.  The dialogue Kevin writes for you guys, is that really kind of you guys, too?  Are you into things like Star Wars?  No, that's the worst misconception about me.  Really?  Yeah.  I've debated Star Wars with more people.  You'd think I played Chewbacca, for God's sakes.  You don't care, right?  I don't know a thing about it, and that's my answer.  That's hysterical, man.  I saw the movie. 
[02:01:30]  It was great.  Because there's such valid points coming out of you.  You're like, yeah.  Yeah.  My favorite scene in the whole movie is you talking about Lord of the Rings.  Yeah, it's a funny scene.  That is really well-  Into that at all?  Any of that fantasy movie thing or no?  No, not really.  I'm sorry.  No, he pretty much says it all during this scene in Parks, too.  You know, incidentally, one of my favorite scenes got cut out of the movie,  speaking of Kevin Smith dialogue, but it was trimmed out of the movie just for time,  but there's a scene in the movie where we're coming back from the go-kart tracks  where we're just sitting in the car talking. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know what it is with Kevin sitting in the car talking,  but he does some of his best work there.  But there's a scene that's my character trying to convince his character  that he could, in fact, impregnate his own mother through masturbation.  And it's a very convincing argument.  It's a scarily interesting, yeah, it's totally convincing.  I need to start hawking the DVD already.  Oh, I know.  When you said it was cut, it was cut for time or something.  No, it was cut for DVD.  I don't know how many copies of everything I have to buy now.  You buy the original when it comes out, 
[02:02:30]  and then there's the director's cut and then special edition a few years later.  You wind up with like three or four copies of the same movie.  I just like the box they call them.  It's so stupid.  I'll buy like the special editions, and I only watch the movie.  I don't really watch the extras unless it's like Cuckoo's Nest deleted scenes.  And I just like the pretty box.  It's like an OCD thing.  I have to have the box.  Well, the newer movies all have the deleted scenes and extras,  and they're made.  When they make the movie, they make stuff for the DVD because DVD sells.  It's hard getting the early movies.  Like I want to see outtakes from Planet of the Apes and stuff.  Like that's the stuff. 
[02:03:00]  I want to see the vintage stuff.  Charlton Heston all screwed up and drunk or something.  The Ving Rhames Dakota Fanning scene that they thought was too racy.  It's coming out that Dakota Fanning is going to be topless in her next movie.  There is some movie.  That's the latest.  Coming out.  Very controversial movie coming out with Dakota Fanning where she's 12 years old,  I guess now.  And she's going to be just in her panties.  And it's a rape scene. 
[02:03:30]  Dear God.  Yeah.  Quick, call it Joel Siegel.  Yeah, Joel.  If Joel watches that whole movie, I'm punching him in his mustache.  And the odd thing is she's the perpetrator.  They're having trouble finding money for this now.  A lot of people pulled out of the movie.  Of the movie.  Why can't they show it?  It's obviously anti, you know.  I don't think it's pro. 
[02:04:00]  I mean, like, so why wouldn't they?  I mean, they show everything else.  They're doing a 9-11 movie, which is much more horrific than that.  They need to show how horrible this is for the rest of the movie.  But they asked her parents or her mother, who runs her, I guess, and her agent about this.  And the mother said, this is great.  Do anything else?  Yeah.  Do it again.  Do another take with my little baby.  She's probably a real stage mother.  It didn't hurt Brooke Shields and it won't hurt you.  How much money's involved? 
[02:04:30]  It's all about the money.  Our job is to put the batteries in her.  She said, it's a great Oscar vehicle.  Oh.  A great Oscar vehicle.  I'll bet you they get the funding if she has clothing on, though.  It's supposed to be, yeah, topless with just, like, underwear on.  I'll bet you they get the funding once she has her clothes on.  Don't put her shirt on.  Even that?  It's different.  The nudity is different, man.  So there's, like, a really weird line between... 
[02:05:00]  Usually that is suggested in a movie.  Like, you'll see the girl all despondent or something later.  But, you know, like, to show the actual scene, that's a first.  That's going to be a little rough.  Hello.  Vulgar, the movie?  What do you mean the first?  Okay.  I'm being raped by, well, dressed up like a clown by three men.  You're a grown man.  Where's the uproar of that, huh?  Yeah, did you have to make it so realistic, by the way?  That's why I can't look at you.  You know what?  You're talking about pudding again?  You were such not really a likable character in that, 
[02:05:30]  that we didn't mind seeing you gang raped.  It's kind of fun to watch.  Best man rape, vulgar and capturing the Freedmen.  There you go.  You were...  I didn't see that.  I'm sorry.  You were so disheveled and wrecked after that.  That played off great, the way you were just like...  That's usually the way that works.  Yeah, I don't think you'd have...  I'd never done it.  I'd imagine I'd be pretty disheveled.  Well, thanks for a good time, guys.  See you later.  Call me. 
[02:06:00]  He was raped by a bunch of men, not a hair out of place.  Do your friends kill you on that or what?  I have friends who still refuse to even see the movie.  Like I have some female friends who are just like,  I don't know, because I'm afraid if I look at that and then look at you,  I won't be able to see you the same way.  And so I'm like, yes, please, don't see it.  Yeah, don't.  We were in Pittsburgh waiting to go on some morning show  and this group of nursing school women were waiting to go on  to promote their nursing school.  And she's like, first of all, the morning they show you 
[02:06:30]  what's coming on the show in the day  and they're looking up at the monitor and like,  and Clerks 2, The Foul Mouth, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And the woman just went, shook her head and looked down.  Oh, that's not good.  And then she didn't realize that we're in the room.  And so I just started laughing.  And she looks over.  And she's like, so what do you guys are in for?  And I'm like, we're that foul mouth movie  that you just don't want to go see.  She's like, oh, no, I want to see it.  And it turns out that I totally just told her, don't go.  Listen to Joel Siegel, just don't go.  It's not for everyone. 
[02:07:00]  She's such a church-going woman.  And then she gets up there and she's the most boring  in this interview about, you know, nursing school.  Yeah, how the hell do you make that sound interesting?  I'll tell you how.  You get a male nurse.  We get a male nurse in handcuffs  and he explains why he put the pillow over their old faces.  It was to send them to heaven faster.  All right, thank you, Edward.  Male nurses, never good.  They always end up being the angel of death. 
[02:07:30]  It's always a chief Randall McMurphy situation.  I was setting them free.  We're sure you were.  Yeah, the side effect of, for some reason,  all the old people are found with little bent noses  in their deathbed.  They can't figure it out.  Why are there teeth prints on the inside of their gums?  I don't know.  She was hungry.  Mouth full of feathers.  I can't figure it out.  What's killing them?  So he's on Bob's shift.  These nurses, where are they from, New Orleans? 
[02:08:00]  Hey, let's go to John in Jersey real fast.  John.  John.  Yes.  Second Z.  What do you got, bro?  Hey, Jeff.  How are you doing?  It's John.  I used to work with you in Lucent.  Really?  Cool.  John, who?  Can we narrow it down?  There were 10,000 people who worked in that building.  Good then, Chuck.  Oh, hey.  What's up, man?  How you been, man?  I loved your work in your other movies and just wanted to say hi.  You loved my work at AT&T?  Thank you, sir.  I knew you were destined for bigger things. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  Sorry, I haven't achieved yet.  Hey, John.  Can I tell you a secret?  Sure.  If you had welcome written on your chest, he would stand on you and not realize he had  met you before.  By the way, John, you're my new agent.  I hear you.  All right, John.  A lot of people from the past kind of perk up.  Yeah, old guys, oddly enough.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Hey, dude, you remember?  I went to school with you and I was the guy that, yeah, and you got to go, yeah, yeah.  And then they bring up something that you need to respond to, like a call, counter call 
[02:09:00]  sign thing, and you're like, okay, you got me.  I have no idea who you are.  I got to go.  All embarrassed.  Here's how you handle that.  Okay, Jimmy.  Smother them with a pillow.  No, you just go look.  I don't remember.  I have AIDS.  Oh, Jesus.  That'll change the course of the conversation.  They feel bad for you and they stop talking to you.  Hey, let's say hi to Chris in Boston.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up there, man?  Hey, I'm curious.  I want to ask Dante, I've seen the movie Volga and I was curious, how does one prepare to 
[02:09:30]  get F'd in the A with the clown face makeup on?  Just the clown face was different, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just pretty much, you just stroll down to Soho after 20 years and just let them  roll you.  Just let them roll you.  Yeah, get into the character.  All right.  Let them get into the character.  Yeah, that was bad.  He wants references like he wants to get into it.  You did have to make like the faces, like when you're laying there. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You have to make those faces.  Yeah.  How do you know what faces?  It's got to be based on something.  I mean, because you watch something like American History X and, you know, he had that scene  in the shower there where he gets it.  Norton, Edward Norton.  Edward Norton.  Gets it.  You are method, aren't you?  Yeah.  Well, you go to the school, you got to do the work, right?  I guess you just imagine what face would I make if this was happening.  What would you make, sir? 
[02:10:30]  It would be like, there you go.  Oscar winning performance, sir.  Hey, we're running out of show.  A combination of, ouch, and could you slow down a little?  Yeah.  We're just getting into it.  These guys are great.  You guys are really, really good.  If you want to do more radio with us, you're more than welcome, but we're not going to put  you on the spot or anything.  We understand you guys are busy.  Clerks 2 opens today.  Don't miss it.  Absolutely.  Dante and Randall from the movie.  Joel Segal says it's a must-see.  Yeah.  It's a must-walk out on.  Dr. Ian Smith. 
[02:11:00]  Yo.  Yeah.  Quick, we're running out of time.  You're going to probably go over to XM, but real fast.  Fat Smash Diet.  We're looking for anybody who wants to be on a new TV show that we're casting for who  wants to lose weight.  So go to fatsmashdiet.com and send us an email.  You want to lose weight.  All right.  We're continuing on XM.  If you're not joining us, have a great weekend.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:11:30]  The M.I.R. is spreading.  Conquer Earth, you bastards!  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony!  XM 202!  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  I guess I'm the first one out, huh? 
[02:12:00]  The Clerks 2 guys are signing autographs on the breezeway here outside Free FM in New York City.  Dante and Randall, Clerks 2, getting good reviews in the New York papers.  Here comes Jimmy and Anthony.  First half of the show is nice.  I like the first half of the show today. 
[02:12:30]  Got a nice crowd out here, too.  It's going to be crappy this weekend in New York, right?  It's going to be crappy?  Yeah.  The weather?  The weather?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I like it like this.  I think it's shitty.  I was going to go out east this weekend, and that ain't happening.  Screw that.  Hey, hey.  There we go.  Sorry.  I was just over there watching people just assault them with autographs. 
[02:13:00]  It's one guy that has like 80 fucking pictures for these guys to sign.  What's wrong with you?  He's one of these.  What are you going to do with those?  You're selling them.  So you're telling them that you're selling them.  You know what, though?  I like.  He won't get his listing fee.  I like his honesty.  I'm going to prove you wrong, man.  At least he was honest.  I like the fact that he told the truth.  The best thing is, though, when the Weinstein company.  Dude, just bring two things.  Don't bring fit enough.  Leave him alone.  Don't go over a little bit.  Okay. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, Kenny.  See, that's the type of stuff that makes guys not want to sign autographs.  I know.  Mostly athletes.  When some poor kid comes up and goes, hey, could I have an autograph?  And you go, get the fuck out of here.  You're going to sell this on eBay, you little bastard.  Yeah.  Because people have signed.  Oh, what a beautiful day in New York this is.  Jesus Christ.  It looks like the beginning of Ghostbusters.  This is terrific.  What's going to happen?  That is an ominous sky, man.  I really want to go kick those pictures out of his hand and make him pick them up. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, did you want to rip them?  A good fucking Connie Carlo moment.  You get a lot of that in L.A., though?  L.A. was kind of rough, especially at the premiere.  We had these guys, and they have literally two armfuls of photos that are obviously stolen.  And they're still captures from the DVD.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, and they print these up.  And I'm like, God, the Weinsteins could have a field day with this guy and steal his iPod, at least.  How the fuck do they have the balls, though, to come up and hand you so much shit?  Get one thing signed, a picture of you with the person, or one fucking thing. 
[02:14:30]  Or you should only sign stuff that you personalize.  You know what?  Without those guys, though, you know, we'll have no weekend, to be honest with you.  You know what I mean?  Those guys.  Don't kiss their ass.  You know something?  You're a good egg, Noonan.  You really are.  You know, but to be honest with you, I mean, they are really just a fucking, you know, a Kool-Aid and a purple Nike away from a cult.  So I really don't want, God forbid, Kevin should ever issue a fatwa.  Forget it.  We're dead.  You're dead.  He definitely has a following that you don't want to fuck with. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, it's either, it's a very love-hate thing that goes on with Kevin's movies.  People will, like, I go to his message board and read some of the posts, and they adore him like a god.  And then you go to some other places, and people just hate him no matter what he does.  They hate that he's breathing.  And it's always dudes.  Yeah.  That's the whole thing.  It's never chicks.  That's our problem, too.  Welcome to it.  That's our problem, too.  Whoa!  Here we are.  Nice one.  Child star back there in the fucking...  And we all start coming and let it happen. 
[02:15:30]  Child star.  And how many days, how many weeks now have you done this walk?  Oh, two months.  And he hasn't figured out where the bus stop thing is?  No.  He hits it all the time.  Yeah.  Three months already doing it.  We call him child star.  Doesn't he look like a grown-up child star?  He looks like he should be in the Dakota Fanning movie.  Hey, he wishes.  He's got the chest.  That's true.  Child face and man legs.  Hey, look at this guy taking a random picture on the corner.  There you go.  Hello, sir. 
[02:16:00]  Want to go this way today?  Why?  There's so many choices.  I don't know.  Yeah, across here or there.  Well, let's talk to our buddy over there on the corner.  That's right.  I haven't spoken to him in a while.  Yeah, we'll make this interesting for you guys.  That's our homeless friend over there.  Here's the guy that we feel bad...  We feel bad that they were just doing a story about how a gorilla got fucking hip implants.  Stupid.  Get out of the road.  He's going to get a fucking hit.  For his arthritis.  And they must have spent millions on it.  Holy shit.  And this poor guy is going to lose his feet. 
[02:16:30]  So that...  Yeah, lovely.  Big, fat.  They probably smell like lamb under the...  Oh, good.  Yeah, because gorillas don't give a flying fuck about other gorilla sitting there with hip surgery implants.  But this guy, his name is Mack, but somebody brought up the fact that he does look like Frederick Douglass.  So now we call him Frederick Douglass.  He's sitting on the other side of the street.  Yeah, you've got to check this guy out.  We toss him a few bucks and...  Let's see if he's seen clerks. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, we'll ask him if he's going to go.  They chase him out of the stores for stealing.  Nothing?  All right.  You'll get nothing like it.  That was...  You know what a bad bomb that was?  After that joke, he just heard a car in the distance driving.  The squealing of a break.  What's up, bro?  What, you leaving us?  Mack, what's up?  Where you going?  I ain't going nowhere.  Back to New Orleans?  Say that again.  Norman.  No.  You hanging out?  What's with the suitcase?  Oh, they stole my bags.  They stole your...  Who's they? 
[02:17:30]  I don't know.  Son of a bitch.  Where do you sleep at night where you're getting ripped off?  Subway.  The subway?  Yeah.  Isn't it hot down there, though?  Yeah.  Why don't you sleep in the park?  They bug you?  Yeah.  Do you know...  Who, the cops or...  Can't go in the park.  You can't go in the park at night?  Are you like one of the mole people that goes all the way under and lives down?  I know those guys?  No.  I see some of them.  I see you got your luggage.  You want to come on the Trump plane with me?  I would like to.  We'll do that.  Yeah, get them on the first class. 
[02:18:00]  You ever see Clerks?  Clerks.  The movie Clerks?  No.  When was the last time you...  What was the last movie you saw?  Oh, it was so long.  It was so long ago?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exorcist.  Exorcist.  Exorcist.  Something tells me the theater had really sticky floor.  I'm just going out on a limb here.  The last movie he saw was The Exorcist?  The Exorcist.  That's how I want you to movie.  Wow.  That's like 1974.  1973. 
[02:18:30]  74.  All right.  It's raining.  All right, Kenny.  It's not acid.  Exactly.  It's raining.  You could get wet.  Big dolt.  We have to hide.  All right.  You got nothing today.  You know that, right?  You got nothing.  Go see Clerks 2.  It's opening tonight.  Here, I'll give you this.  But you got to go to the movies.  I don't like the way.  Because I'm going to come back for a review.  All right.  Now, Monday or Tuesday, I'm going to come back, and I want a review of Clerks 2 from you. 
[02:19:00]  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  And don't walk out on the donkey scene.  Don't do it.  Just don't do it.  You like bestiality?  No.  I didn't see that.  Well, it's not a whole movie about bestiality.  I don't know what that is.  You don't know what bestiality is?  No.  It's fucking animals.  It's when a human being puts his penis in an animal.  You know?  Nice, you know.  You ever see German chicken fuck videos?  No.  No?  Or how about like a nice Doberman jumping up on a girl, and it mounts her, and they have 
[02:19:30]  like little pads over the claws so they don't cut her.  She sucks on the lipstick.  No.  No?  It's disgusting slash hot.  No.  Yeah, that's all it's about.  Do you think he even knows about the internet?  Come on.  That's what it's about.  No.  Yeah, that's a good question.  You know about the internet?  No.  Holy Jesus.  He's in a time machine.  I'm telling you, man.  It's a fucking time machine.  This is Frederick Douglas.  What are you talking about, sir?  It is Frederick Douglas.  He just has a really good diet, apparently.  Wow.  How about email? 
[02:20:00]  No.  You've heard of it.  Yeah, I've heard of it.  Yeah, you've heard of email.  I told you about it.  I just heard about it.  You heard about it?  Yeah.  You have children, Mac?  No.  You have children?  Yeah.  How old are they?  The youngest is about 35.  35?  How old a man are you?  60.  You're 60?  62.  62.  Okay.  Well, let's get out of here before.  These guys are actually very, very famous guys. 
[02:20:30]  Yes, they're in Clerks 2, the movie.  You can remember that, Clerks 2.  Oh, man.  Yeah, go see it, and then Tuesday we get your review.  Okay.  Yeah, just think of Clerks, but then just think sequel.  Now, Parrish, don't you spend that money on booze or drugs or anything.  That's right.  Seriously, get out of the rain and go see the movie, sir.  Definitely.  Hey, you're making out like a bandit today.  And this is what a scumbag Anthony is.  Anthony palmed it, but made sure the two and the zero were face up.  No, I just, yeah, I am a creep.  Yeah, that was very strategic.  Take it easy. 
[02:21:00]  It really was.  Okay, a little something for you, but not that little.  There you go.  And once again, I get away with not giving any money.  Of course you don't.  Yeah, skin flint.  Hope's a pinch penny.  And a smart guy.  He's stingy with his purse strings.  We got something in common, though.  I'm homeless, too.  Yeah.  I can relate to that, man.  That's true.  Yeah, we'll start giving Opie money.  In my $500 a night hotel.  Those things you were killing, Mac would have eaten.  Oh, he's a good boy. 
[02:21:30]  Well, he better go.  Hey, that's a good new bit.  How about we get Mac to go do movie reviews?  Wow.  You know what?  You should.  Yeah.  Yeah, and every Monday.  Did you see the movie?  No.  No, you pay him to go.  You pay him after he comes back.  I was in rehab.  I was on a drug then.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  We'll pay him after he sees the movie.  Yeah, you don't pay him before.  Here you go.  Drink yourself into fucking a three-day stint.  You just make him go see the movie, and then you promise him money, and when he comes,  you hit him.  All right, it's starting to rain pretty good, so let's get right inside.  All right.  Hey, there they are.  How are you doing, gentlemen?  Thanks, guys. 
[02:22:00]  Have a good weekend.  Everyone goes in.  The new building.  And that's the walkover.  Thanks, guys. 
[02:22:30]  syndicated show canceled.  Did these shock jocks simply go too far?  When they crossed the line.  This is outrageous.  Oh, dear.  What are you, stupid?  Huh?  Just wanted to do what's going good.  Greg Opie Hughes.  I like jam bags on the floor.  And Anthony Cillia.  I'm hoping for a big, fiery rear-ender.  Broadcast an outrageous live account of a couple allegedly having sex right in New York's 
[02:23:00]  St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day of obligation.  Resided over the slaughter of a wild kid.  Closed down San Francisco's Bay Bridge.  They've urged teenage girls to run naked.  And invited listeners to compare the taste of eggnog and urine.  They've scorned everything up.  Shock jocks.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form,  the nerve of these people to actually have it as a setup.  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  Die.  Die.  They'll be an empty show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:23:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  guitar solo 
[02:24:00]  guitar solo 
[02:24:30]  I like when  I like when new people come in  and can kind of  point out or realize 
[02:25:00]  how stupid our jobs really are  you know that we  walk over  you need new people to tell you that  yeah because we kind of just  take it for granted  you guys go wait you like  you broadcast when you walk over  and then it gave me a minute to think about it  and I went yeah  that is stupid isn't it  you guys are big man you should have a rickshaw or something  we had one for Jimmy on his birthday  a couple days ago  but that's about it  when winter comes around though because I hate the cold 
[02:25:30]  there's no way I'm doing that in cold weather  I'll watch them from a van  or something  van window  we got to go right to the phones  there's a girl that wants to shoot her seven guns for us  this got us in a little bit of a jam  yeah we kind of made page four the telly news yesterday for this exact thing  but she wants to do a topless  Trina  what the hell is that going to do  this is radio right  yeah  I know  maybe she has a pal talk camera  Trina  yeah what's up Opie and Anthony 
[02:26:00]  where are you calling from  I'm calling from Carmel, New York  where the hell is that  could those guns reach us  yeah fire them up  you're really going to have to arc that  so you're going to do this topless  I'm going to do this topless just for you guys  now we got to ask you here  what are you shooting at  well I've got a little target range  I'm an avid hunter  so I've got a little spot all set up for myself  on private property that I'm allowed to be on  all right 
[02:26:30]  and I even pre-called the police department and everything  so we are all set  is your last name Nugent?  yeah no kidding  I can't tell you my last name because of the job I do  but I can tell you that  what's your job?  rocket scientist?  no  oh she got a kick out of that Opie  well thank you  she manually masturbates animals for artificial insemination  we found her  we owe you a check  and no not for that 
[02:27:00]  well  he's saying it's a cockfest  not at all  I listen all the time  have for a lot of years  well there's a lot of problems here  first of all  what's your job?  real fast  well I'm a registered nurse  but I'm also a legal secretary  oh yeah  I don't want to get in trouble  with the rest of the secretaries out there  yeah  alright so that's the first problem  you don't want to get in trouble  with the secretary union  and topless  who's going to see you topless?  this is radio  you said you're doing it for us 
[02:27:30]  nobody but a bunch of deer and turkeys  although I had a lot of offers to come and film today  I'll tell you that  how do we know you're topless?  you're going to have to trust me  sounds like your prom date  yeah  and I don't understand the  I'm having a purpose of you being topless and shooting on the radio  why not just take the pants off?  I mean  the only deer and turkey are going to see it  let's just go all out  if a girl is topless but no one can see her  is she really topless?  that's kind of like the old saying 
[02:28:00]  if a tree falls  hold on  oh it is  oh really you think it is?  hold on  explain that  I didn't get that  what were you going to explain miss?  we've got a deer on line 3  let's confirm  yes she is  miss what were you going to say about the tree falling?  hey you guys were just talking about beastiality  I think it's a buck  hold on a minute  come back trying to get her to say it again  wait you see a buck?  no I'm only kidding  it's actually a black guy  I was about to say  she's seen a couple of bucks  is she in the strip club now? 
[02:28:30]  yeah right  because she's topless  I'm having like a Jeff Dunham flashback  I am hoping she does her  R. Bud Dwyer impression  is his name Jeff Dunham?  he has that puppet peanut  no  no  no no no no no  you've lost me  what?  well I'm not trying to do a joke  wait what did you say?  oh no  no  Jeff Dunham and peanut is a guy  he's a ventriloquist  take that back  he does the Hertz commercials  take that back  but the funny thing is though  it's always the foam puppet  that says the crazy things 
[02:29:00]  and I'm like  ah look at this little funny friend he has  kind of like Jeff here in Clerks  that was just a set up  I'm not even bombing yet  ah don't take it back  I'm not even bombing yet  hold on  thank you  no I'm just having one of those moments  because we had to talk to Jeff Dunham  alright  he's a puppet act  and he's on the phone  it's a jalapeno on a stick  that dude  is it?  doesn't he have that  doesn't he have like a jalapeno on a stick  and he's got peanut  he's got the old  oh I've seen that guy  yeah  isn't that him  is this the guy we're talking about?  it's a cast of characters  I get where you're going with this 
[02:29:30]  you were interviewing him on the phone  and you wanted to know  if he had the puppet out  or he was just doing the voice  right  exactly  and he said he had the puppet  and he had to admit  that he was working the puppet  but Jeff  it was a real awkward moment  I bet he had to feel stupid  right about it then  no one could see you  why don't you just do the voice  and he's like  and then we realized  that he can't really do the voice  unless he has the puppet  or something  well in actually  the equips are like sickos  they're all fucking weird  it takes a life of its own  it takes a life of its own  it's like your alter ego  like Otto and George  he can't do it without the puppet 
[02:30:00]  that's so fucking funny  Trina  yeah  we got a guy that's in the area  he wants to prove that you're topless  he does  I'd like to see him find me  I'm up on top of a mountain  that I have a key to the gate  to get up there  so good luck finding me  the gate mountain topless  you got your own mountain  it's like a goddess  yeah  oh man  this is like a whole  lord of the rings thing  take your pants off  and then I could only hope  for a ricochet  and nude body found in woods  yeah  son of a gun  that's son of a gun  chicks that got pregnant  from bullets 
[02:30:30]  that's where that thing came from  that was the urban legend  yeah  but Trina just wants to keep babbling  go ahead  say that again  civil war right  was it civil war  it was  the Mythbusters tested it  and it couldn't  it could never happen  a shot went through  a gentleman's testicle  yes  and that's how the chick  got pregnant  instead of just admitting  that she fucked someone  lodged in her womb  or something  and then I think  a conglomerated  a conglomerated  mongrel  a lot of mess  came out of  wait a minute 
[02:31:00]  so she banged some black guy  got pregnant  no not a black guy  just a guy  she had to tell her husband  like I got shot  she told them that  the bullet shot through  a guy's nuts  and then impregnated her  that's where the phrase  son of a gun came from  hit her  that's a hell of a show  and got some spooge  on her enough that  by the way  what is the  the masturbating  getting your mom  pregnant  thing  oh yeah  we couldn't talk about it  over there  now we can  in graphic detail  I want to know  how that is feasible 
[02:31:30]  is Kevin going to get mad  if I give this scene away  yeah  it's  I don't know  wait what if we walk out  halfway through your story  Joel Siegel  you son of a bitch  I've never  Trina  Trina  shit than that  at work  trust me  Trina  what  are you ready  to shoot your guns  yes  shoot  what do you got  what kind of gun  well  I hope so  I had to go through  a couple magazines  because I needed  a target on my  I can't believe  she's going to shoot  a gun topless  and your first question  was what kind of gun

[02:38:00]  Lyme disease  or the twat  if that happens  I'm showing up  at your studio  and you're gonna  pull it out  with a pair of tweezers  will we  yeah or just burn it off  right  by the time she  get the TV for that  by the time she would  get here  it'd be the size  of a watermelon  yeah nice and swollen  I like it  big swollen labia  can we play the song  or do we do the setup  let's just do the setup  alright and then the song  and then the song  the song is nice  it's guess what's in my pants  what she's gonna do 
[02:38:30]  is take the phone  as per our direction  she will rub it  in various directions  on her  most intimate of areas  can I interrupt you  because I really don't want to lose  you often do  I know I'm sorry  but I don't want to lose Sally  Sally from Chicago  this is my rifle  and this is my cunt  one is for fucking  the others to hunt  pretty funny  alright  a little full metal jacket  sorry Anthony  I thought you'd enjoy that  that was very good  back to you  I'm sorry  she will take her phone  and rub it up and down  side to side  and then in a circular motion 
[02:39:00]  on her most intimate of areas  and using only the sound  we must try to figure out  what hairstyle she's sporting  the choices are  the standard issue triangle  that most women have  whether it's  clipped down neatly  or a big 70's  earth mama muff  what we like to call  the pool rack  full of hair  it doesn't matter  it's just the basic  standard issue triangle  then there's the mohawk  or the landing strip  everyone knows what that is  it's shaved in  on the sides  to leave  a mohawk  then the Hitler mustache 
[02:39:30]  which is a little like  the mohawk  only shaved down  from top to bottom  leaving nothing  but a Hitler mustache  looks good  when the girl's  standing up  with her legs  kind of crossed  looks very silly  when they're on their back  with their legs spread  because then you see everything  and then this little tuft of hair  out of nowhere  looks even worse  when a guy's down there  chowing out  and you look down  and he's wearing it  dear lord  but the uniform looks snappy  doesn't it  yes it does  and then of course  the wood floor 
[02:40:00]  the clean shaven  what we used to call  the JonBenet Ramsey  yeah  but now I would like to  re-dub the Dakota family  I knew you were going there  yes  that's right  battery's not included  I still enjoy that battery  all right  are we ready for the song  here's the song  I'm ready  it's so happy  this song  why shouldn't it be  it's time to play  it's time to play 
[02:40:30]  it's time to play  it's what's in my pants  now a little description  place your receiver  upon your beaver  got that wrong  it's time to play  it's what's in my pants  it's time  to guess  what's in my pants  my pants  all right  now remember Trina  no clues  no hints  when you hear us guess  don't say uh-huh  or something stupid  like that  okay  say nothing  until you tell me  all right  now if you would  take the phone  and rub it 
[02:41:00]  in an up and down  fashion  now let's listen  whoa  whoa  whoa  I think I'm liking it  too much  all right  that's oh see  she's enjoying it  did you just sand  the handle of one  of your guns  what happened there  she's making a stock  I'll be right back  honey I'm gonna use  my pushy to clean  the pots  uh if you want  to do it again  feel free 
[02:41:30]  go ahead man  wow there's a little  break  I think she just  shot the rapid fire  gun  you heard something  gunfire  see you're  you're thinking  you heard a little  something there  right  yeah there you go  now the very telling  um one is side to side  so if you do that  for a few times  so we could hear this  side to side  all right hold on  I don't think it's  going to be as exciting  as the up and down  but hold on  hearing a little 
[02:42:00]  different sounds  I think we need  to go inside today  shove it up your ass  if you're good  uh now the all  important circular  motion just rub it  around in a circle  okay  sounds like gunfire  doesn't it  yeah it does  I think we're  broadcasting from  Beirut  oh my god  we're under attack  let's go back  to Wolf Blitzer 
[02:42:30]  in the situation  room  well this one's  pretty obvious  something going on  there  yep  um  I'll be first  I'm going to say  and don't  don't agree  or say anything  Trina please  I won't answer  um I think it's  um  I think it's a  landing strip  a mohawk  that's what my  guess is going to  be  oh  trimmed up nice  though  Ope's got a  pretty good record  so far  I'm getting  mosquito bit  on my butt  oh  that wasn't a  mosquito  that's right  that was an  HIV needle 
[02:43:00]  only hope for  encephalitis  I honestly don't  know  you don't know  I'm going to go  old school  I think it's like  a triangle  you're going to go  standard issue  but it's trimmed  down nice  trimmed down  standard issue  I think you have  some kind of  I think she gave  it away with the  side by side  so you know what  I'm going to go  landing strip as  well  Brian  I will agree  with the  landing strip  the deviation  and sound  on the side  to side  got me  yep  for some reason  I was picturing  her shaving  little patches  and trying to  do a camouflage  thing 
[02:43:30]  I don't know  where I got that  wow I never  thought of the  camo option  I see her really  taking the time  to trace little  patches out  and I don't know  why I get that  from you  which we will  call the G.I.  Joe from now on  I am going to go  with the landing  strip with a little  Don Johnson on the  side  it's not a fresh  landing strip  is what I'm saying  landing strip  with some stubble  sort of yeah  a little wham  either that or  the hairs just  pushed on through  when she was  shooting the gun  because they were  just loving it  I'm not disagreeing  with him  I was going to  say some kind 
[02:44:00]  of a design  I don't think  it's a traditional  cut  that's going to  be some wacky  wow  there's some kind  of a design  there  how do you  camouflage a vagina  you shave a  starkest can  into your pubes  that would throw  me off  wait a minute  the hell is that  pull tab here  are we ready to  find out what  Trina has in her  pants  the guesses are  in Trina  if you would  now tell us  please  what is in  your pants  I shave  every part  of my body  bald  wood floor  you know what  I'm not going to

[02:52:30]  what are you  implying  got you like  the clown  I don't like  where we're going  with this man  let me see  your clown face  show me your  clown face  I'm assuming  that that  relationship  was how he  actually the  relationship  was more  later he  actually worked  in that crappy  video store  that was in  Clerks  that's where  he worked  after high  school and  I would go  there and rent  videos because  nobody else did  really  that bad 
[02:53:00]  yeah pretty  bad  I mean it is  that place  we didn't  glam it up  for the movies  and there were  the mom and pop  places that like  for five minutes  were popular  yeah  you'd need like  a hundred dollar  membership fee  to start  and then they'd  have like one  movie and then  blockbuster moved  in and just like  cleaned them out  killed them  but yeah they  were those little  fucking video  stores like that  I ran one of  those places in  Geneseo  I was the  day guy  oh Geneseo  wow  Geneseo  big metropolis  and my buddies 
[02:53:30]  would come in  and we would  just watch  porns all day  and we wouldn't  even turn off  the porno  when the mom  came in with  the kids and  stuff and I  ended up getting  fired  I believe we owe  you a check  for that story  there were the  sections too  where there was  the regular movies  and then you  walked through  the beads  or whatever the  hell separated  the porno  now this was a  family store  that's the weird  part  we were bringing  our own porno  really  I swear to god  homemade  I swear to god  some chick out 
[02:54:00]  in your yard  shooting a gun  with a tampon  this is some  sick shit man  fucking crabs  rappelling down  the string  you know college  kids don't have  any money  so the word  got out  those were tics  the word got out  I was running  the place  so people came  in to just  take movies  want free movies  yeah  free movies  and free  VCRs at the  time  no one had a  VCR  so we were  renting them  so they would  come in  and just take  all the  VCRs I was  supposed to  rent  and just take  whatever movies  they wanted 
[02:54:30]  it was a mess  big top loaders  with the channel  they needed a  station wagon  to get it  the big  beta max  you know what  you know what  was kind of sad  when we went  back to shoot  clerks 2  we walked  into the  video store  and it's  literally all  VHS's  and they had  one shelf  that had  four DVDs  on it  that's where  they ended  DVDs came  and they  wouldn't make  the jump  they had  four DVDs  I'm holding out  man  I killed the  babysitter  horrible DVDs  people still 
[02:55:00]  run videos  though  it's amazing  that that's  survived at all  it won't for long  yeah  I don't even  go to the  stores anymore  the DVDs  are so cheap  I just buy  them to have  them  no matter  how lousy  the movie is  or on demand  yeah on demand  is another one  all that stuff  you don't have  to go to  block  you got the  classics  though  you got to  get all the  classics  you need your  Caddyshack  on DVD  if you want  to throw it  in every so  often  or Animal  House  things like  that  get things  signed  got Richard  Dreyfuss  to sign  my Close  Encounters  which was  like one  of those  moments  that was 
[02:55:30]  pretty cool  taboo 2  yeah  taboo 2  what was the  fucking rape  one on the  rock  that's  I Spit  on Your  Grave  yeah  that's  kind of  like a  thriller  slash  comedy  and what  was  a horrific  rape scene  on a rock  what was  cool  Richard  Dreyfuss  signed  that  as well  for him  he signed  the blood  stain  on the rock  let's go  to Paul  in Kansas  we got to  get a plug  in for  clerks  too  here  Paul  what's  up  hey  guys  I just  wanted to

[02:56:30]  t-shirts  and 42  more  dolls  can we  go to  the  monkey  playing  poker  on  WB11  yeah  I  want to  see  what  that  was  all  about  you  guys  would  have  some  fun  with  this  we  only  we  hate  the  news  we  can't  stand  it  anymore  because  it's  not  really  news  that  you 
[02:57:00]  sound  that  green  room  because  we  had  to  play  that  first  we  didn't  know  you  guys  would  be  such  a  great  hang  we  would  have  brought  you  in  right  away  to  have  fun  with  that  with  people  never  do  we  like  did  Kevin  Smith  script  their  interview  because  if  not  keep  them  out  there  are  times  we  have  people  on  we  get  so  excited  like  they  gotta  do  good  radio  and  just  sit  there  like  oh  my  god  this  is  gonna  be  so  painful  waiting  for  the  questions  you  just  never  know  so  we  usually  take  the  conservative  approach  you have  that  friend  of yours  Kevin  the really  big  big guy  he comes  to all the  Kevin 
[02:57:30]  Smith events  all the  time  he's like  we gotta  have you  on  you gotta  come  on the  show  you gotta  come  on  the  show  I  gave  him  my  information  like  a  year  and  a  half  ago  and  he's  like  how come  you haven't  called me  sir  what do you mean  we've said we'd do the show a long time ago  I'm gonna lambast him now  good  anytime you guys are in the area  please  stop by  so we were watching the WB11 news this morning  which is probably the worst one  here in New York  they've had to actually go to just getting attractive people on the news  like that's all they got 
[02:58:00]  is like really hot chicks  they didn't have like Linda Lopez  yeah they had her on for a while  and then the traffic girl that used to be in a helicopter  who's like hot and posed naked  now they put her in the entertainment section  so she's got a bigger part  who's doing this show  Trump  is he the executive producer  yeah Trump  Donald Trump figured out a way to make people watch the news  hot chicks  blood wrestling  and the news though  they try to scare you  which is a great thing  you're trying to watch some show  you watch a rerun of Seinfeld  and they'll pop in at 10 o'clock  what toy is killing your child 
[02:58:30]  and you're like  what the fuck  and he's playing with something now  I gotta pull everything away till 10  and it's the scary news tease  it's not news  it's not information  it's a way to scare you  and it's a way to make you tune in  to get ratings for revenue  so it's all the same thing  it's entertainment  it's not real news  it's not Cronkite sitting behind a desk  with a clock behind him  telling you  President Kennedy has just been shot  you know that's news  so we love goofing on the news  and when we saw  because we can't turn the sound up  on the TVs 
[02:59:00]  when we're doing radio  we like to  we do sometimes  just sit here and watch TV  fucking  but we saw a monkey playing cards  and I have to hear the audio  nothing cuter than a little monkey in a hat though  well you get the bad newscaster jokes  and they try to improv through the whole thing  improv  and the monkey's doing the best job  and then we like to remind these news programs  that World War 3 has begun  you might want to cover that  there's something a little more important  than a poker playing monkey going on  yeah exactly  and please don't stray from the script  yeah don't stray  that uncomfortable moment of you 
[02:59:30]  trying to come up with something clever  oh shit  and then trying to re-entry back into the script  right  oh look they hit a bad angle  and bounced off the atmosphere  oh my god  I saw a tile fly on  just the minute he left the fucking script  oh foam hit the wing  poker playing chimp on WB11  it starts with bad newscaster jokes  that's the intro of the script  of course  nice  alright I'll see you a 50  and I'll raise you a banana  raise me a banana? 
[03:00:00]  yeah  already Jimmy's got a problem  already  that was not a good joke  you're an ass  could have been hacky right  a little bit of a hack joke there  I didn't get it  alright I'll see you a 50  and I'll raise you a banana  raise me a banana?  yeah  well the popular past time game of poker  has gone ape wild  yeah it has  I'm here to challenge us to a friendly game  is Mikey the poker playing chimp  and his trainer  now that was 
[03:00:30]  you did a pilot with this fucking chimp  I did a pilot  the chimp  I even said it was on  I bet you that was Mikey  because I kind of recognized  you recognized the chimp  the woman who was with him  who was his handler  his handler  do me a favor  and write down the name of your agent  so I know not who to sign with  Mikey the chimp  when you have to  when you're sitting somewhere  and I have to point at the television  and go  I worked with that chimp  and you're not on the TV  when the pilot gets picked up  but you don't  that's fucking trouble 
[03:01:00]  I  love  Mikey the chimp  who couldn't  he was adorable  he was so cute  and he loved me  she said he bonded to me  faster than anybody  because you look like  a little chimp yourself  the monkey loved me  yeah  look at you  here's what you did with him  to make him happy  he would sit on your foot  and you gave him a ride  you just tapped your foot up and down  while him and his diaper  sat on your foot  they're so simple  yeah but you can't smile at him  because that's a teeth bearing thing  you can't do that  smile means different thing to a chimp  they'll rip your nuts off  yeah exactly  rip your nuts back  and your foot like that 
[03:01:30]  that poor bastard  that was bringing the monkey  a fucking birthday cake  got his nuts ripped off  we've done hours on that guy  what an idiot  I haven't had a radio show  so give me a moment  I got a lot on my mind  I love this story  that poor bastard  bringing the fucking monkey a cake  they're like  don't fucking tease me  it's my birthday  give me your fucking nuts  give me your wife  I'll chew her fucking foot off  watch this  holy shit  dug into his genitals 
[03:02:00]  he's like  I wanted to give the monkey  a better life  I took him to the sanctuary  the fucking thing  chewed your wife's foot off dude  brings him a cake  monkeys have a tough logic  bite cock first  ask questions later  they fight like  the Irish actually  those hooligans  birthday cake hooligans  they bit his  chewed his foot off  and bit his  nuts off 
[03:02:30]  and then ate his face  like dug right in  and just started  eating his face  why wasn't that  on the WB  but again  you gotta love the news  because the day he gets out  they make the fucking guy  say that he still  doesn't blame the monkeys  fuck you  the thing ate half my ass  I want that fucking thing shot  I'll eat it man  fucking bring me  Michael Jackson's bubbles  I'll eat that fucking thing too  it ate my nuts  any of them  because unless you're Jim  you can't tell one from another  so just bring me any fucking Jim 
[03:03:00]  hey Jim give me that monkey  you're giving a ride on your foot  I'll eat that fucking thing too  drive Jim around  in the back of a police car  to identify the monkey  was that him Jim?  no that wasn't him  different one  why don't we bring Mikey  into our show  I would love to have Mikey come in  we can get him in  we'll just plug where you can get him from  yeah let's do it  we would if you weren't so bitter  about him getting picked up  without you  yeah  you took my line  so you're gonna actually eat his foot  fuck you Mikey  he won't start with the foot  you bluffed me out of that job 
[03:03:30]  you fucking poker player monkey  let's get that done  he was misbehaving so much  on the set too  it was so funny  we were in this cabin  like where you eat  like a cafeteria  in the woods  a cabin  and he was just running  couldn't control him  he was all over the place  wild animals  who the fuck is your agent  now you're in a cabin  I pictured you at least  on a sound set  how did I picture that to you  Jim we got something for you  you're gonna go to a cabin  upstate New York  with a monkey  I was at least giving you  the benefit of the doubt  that you were on the universal lot  like maybe it wasn't that weird 
[03:04:00]  take the monkey  I'm going to the commentary  maybe you thought you had  fucking BJ and the bear  the next BJ and the bear  so I'm like  no you're in fucking  Chattanooga  in a fucking cabin  with a monkey  and a diaper  on your foot  fuck dude  you can't kill yourself  wait do we have  the video of that too  of what  we can't I think  the video of what  we have it though  yeah  on the screen  you can get the information  as to where the contact  oh okay yeah  no we're gonna get him  get that chimp  I want that chimp 
[03:04:30]  oh my god  we haven't even begun  tell her we did a  MTV pilot together  in the email  listen so  oh wow  okay  what up Ope  Donald Loge  is on the line  oh Jesus  man what a crazy day  Donald  yeah hey  what's going on  Donald Loge  from the groomsmen  how are ya  hi  we're doing good  we're in the middle  of talking about  a monkey playing  poker on  on a news program  this morning  dude yesterday  I was just talking 
[03:05:00]  to someone  in an interview  about BJ  and the bear  going through  my hometown  when I was growing up  so it's good  it's a  there's a good  kind of symbiosis  going on right now  what they  they like did a  tour or something  no just you know  like when you're  coming from a small  town and like  you go to Denny's  and people are like  my god Greg  Evigan was sitting  in that booth  just there yesterday  yeah  did bear chew  anybody's foot off  when he was in town  pulling nuts off  no there was no  genital chewing 
[03:05:30]  yeah the greatest  news story ever  so it was a good  appearance  what happened  what was going on  well it's been  well in the poker game  but in the  biting incident  two chimps  attacked a couple  and they bit  the guy's nose off  and he's just a  fucking  it's hilarious  looking  he ate his foot  his balls  and his face  and his fingers  he took the fingers  off one by one  yeah and his fingers  and when he finally  got out of the hospital  after like months  and months  with no nose  of surgery  and everything  all he could do  was profess his love  for this chimp  and I guarantee 
[03:06:00]  they sent the  deaf check  to interview him  because he was  all fucked up  yeah because he was  all fucked up  he's handicapped  send the deaf check  about the monkey  they threw the ball  off  tragic story  back in the newsroom  they were like  did she say balls  let it go  Donald to fill you in  on what's going on  we have  we have Brian and Jeff  from Clerks  and Clerks 2  you know  Dante and Randall  they're sitting in  here  on the show  with us  because they got  a movie out too  they got a movie out  too Clerks 2  so now we don't 
[03:06:30]  know what to do  do we see Clerks 2  or do we see  The Groomsmen  you get the whole  weekend  you can see both  yeah how about that  double header  you gotta see both  Jay Moore's in  The Groomsmen  John Leguizamo  who do you play  in The Groomsmen  I play the most  bitter  infertile  drunken  angry  brother  loser  of all time  oh nice  nice  now did you notice  the older brother  who's not successful  at all  and bitterly  jealous of his  younger brother's  just life  and success  alright that's a good 
[03:07:00]  angry person  he beat me out of the  role  the unsuccessful older guy  he beat me out of the  role  damn you  what are you doing  my problem when I act  is I never know  what to do with my hands  like if I have to sit  and do a scene  like um  on a fucking  you can ask every actor  with a desk  I'm okay  my elbows are on the desk  and I can just gesture  and hold the desk  um I'm good  I'm good  but when he's got a stand  with nothing  what do you do  you should learn anything  from working with Mikey  the chimp  just throw your feces  yeah grab the back  of your diaper 
[03:07:30]  pull out some shit  and lob it  scratch your chin  and throw shit  when in doubt  poor Donald  doesn't know  what he said  is that a real question  I'm just trying  to plug a movie guys  I just  I had to drive  all night up  I'm in Oregon  I'm in the middle  of nowhere  up in the mountains  in Oregon  why are you up there  what are you doing  I have a place up here  mountains of Oregon  wow  what do you  you got a place up there  and that's where you go  I have a tree farm  a tree farm 
[03:08:00]  yes  you're teasing right  now I've got  a 600 acre tree farm  do you need  like to get away  are you one of those  people that like  have to get away  from the LA thing  for a while  and like unwind  no because LA  is pretty mellow  I don't go out  I mean I'm not like  parasailing shit  right  I don't really go out  on the scene  you know I got  a couple of kids  and stuff  but I just like it  I like it up here  do you have automatic  weapons and  will you shoot  them topless  yeah 
[03:08:30]  it's interesting  I just bought  another gun  last week  that was  a .357  but it's  titanium  so it weighs  like an ounce  there's nothing worse  than lugging around  your .350  the weight comes  from the bullets  huh  yeah  wow  and what does it  take to buy one  in Oregon  I'm sure it's like  you know you get  them at a drugstore  yeah it just takes  walking and breathing  hey I gotta ask you  you have any good 
[03:09:00]  Jay Moore stories  he's in this movie  with you  and he's a good  friend of the shop  Jay well I met  Jay doing  Jerry Maguire  yeah you were  another agent  in that movie  exactly  I was his assistant  okay  which is humiliating  and then  Jay  Jay likes to  expose himself  not unlike a chimp  yeah  well we've all  seen his asshole  yes  I was doing a gig  with Jay one time  in Florida  and I walk into  his hotel room  and he goes  Jim come in here  and I walk in  and the doors open  he's on his hands 
[03:09:30]  and knees  with his asshole  open  and I talk to it  without noticing  it wasn't his face  for a half hour  give me those ribs  you  elbow  elbow  those aren't ribs  he can't help it  man  he does it  in the movie  he cannot help it  but want to show  you his asshole  it's really childish  yeah I don't know  what it is with him  yeah we've all seen it  it must be guys  named Jay  because Muse  does the same  exact thing  does he  really  yeah  like showing his ass  oh he's a big  brown eye fan  I don't get it  how can you not be 
[03:10:00]  I did a movie  with him  because we're both  friends with Danny Trejo  we did this movie  in Salt Lake  called Jack's Law  that's how I met  Jason  oh Jason Muse  he's a good guy  yeah exactly  yeah  he got into some  trouble with local  chicks though  local Mormon chicks  as I recall  I don't doubt that  I think he's trying  to go over the  six limit  right  they have like a  limit of you can  only have six wives  exactly 
[03:10:30]  yeah  you know Danny Trejo  huh  yeah  yeah  is he really mean  or a nice guy  no he's a real  yeah he's a really  nice guy  he's a good guy  looks like a real  mean guy  he was really mean  yeah  like he was in  prison  he was in prison  or something  yeah he was in  prison for a long time  how long you've been  you've been acting  for a long time right  I mean a lot of us  remember me from MTV  but I just came back  quite a few years  he was the cat 
[03:11:00]  yeah  yeah I started  when I came  I like I started  in 1989  did you  when I came out  of college  so  a friend of mine  and I were talking  and um  about movies  and stuff like that  and do you feel  that like a lot  of what is making  them seem different  now than they used  to they've changed  so much  and a lot of it  is some people  are going to say  it's the storylines  but other people  were going in like  the direction of the  whole like was the  director or not  you know I mean  like what is your  sense of that  yeah  what do I think 
[03:11:30]  like the direction  of movies is  well yeah  no no no  um like the  difference from  like years ago  say the 89 90  like you know  like say 15 years  16 years  to now  a lot of people  are saying that  they've changed  so much  but they disagree  on the exact  like the merits  and stuff of it  uh yeah  I don't know  if it  I mean I don't  know if  I'm sure back  in the 40s  or 50s  people were talking  about how shitty  movies were becoming  since the 30s  or whatever  you know 
[03:12:00]  like I  um  but I've always  had kind of  my first big movie  was Sneakers  I don't know  if you remember  that  of course  yes  Jim we've all  all of a sudden  Jim's gone all  actor studio  on your ass  yeah no  well no I actually  was curious  you know I guess  you guys are seasoned  acting I mean I'm just  curious to you know  no I just  you know what's weird  is that you kind of  get involved  in the projects  that like I was  always the kind of  actor because I  wasn't like  when I started out  people you  when I started out  everybody was like 
[03:12:30]  some good looking  blonde dude  with the kind of  acid wash  jean jacket  headshot  Jimmy Norton  yeah  I was so different  from that  that the people  who are doing  cheesy shit  don't respond to you  so luckily  you get to do  better stuff  you know  and  I don't know  I just think  I've always kind  of avoided  doing  kind of bad  things  maybe just out  of luck  or whatever  but you kind  of you start 
[03:13:00]  walking down  a certain road  and then that's  who you  who you work  with  so  it's hard  to say  like I  worked  at the early  part of my  career  I worked  with guys  like Oliver Stone  and those kinds  of dudes  and then  and then I did  the cab driver  and what that  did  because I wasn't  really a comic  actor necessarily  but because I did  the cab driver  what is weird  is that in Hollywood  you get this  you get on a list  for television shows  or something  where you're like  this guy's approved  to do comedy  on a TV show 
[03:13:30]  so then it was  easier getting jobs  in that direction  see that just  answered Jimmy's  question  right  thank you  Donald  the notion  of the list  the notion  of approval  is the big  thing  because  you can get  approved  to be a lead  in a sitcom  but you're  you're someone  who doesn't  bring anything  to the table  for an indie  movie to help  get it  fine  but you did  both  my friend  Donald  we only have  a minute left  in the show  so give us  the big plug 
[03:14:00]  for the groomsmen  you gotta see  the groomsmen  it's a great  I mean it's  Matt Lillard  John Leguizamo  it's Ed Burns'  best movie  women will  complain that  it's not  necessarily  there are not  necessarily good  well-rounded  female characters  which is true  but you will  get to see  what men  are all about  especially the  ones that go  to strip  in the middle  of the day  yeah we only  got about  15 seconds  we're gonna  take a break  and be back  in a few minutes  we got 15 minutes  so it's

[03:29:30]  i was apprehensive  because you know  clerks is an odd  movie it's been  around for a long  time it's got  really strange  fans and i  didn't want to  piss them off by  making a really  bad sequel  i don't think  that's possible  he was holding  out for the  money  exactly  it was pot  no that makes  perfect sense  though i've heard  you say that  before in  interviews where  it's like you  know you  it is a special  thing and and  it's uh got such  longevity and  such huge fan base 
[03:30:00]  and a cult status  that you know  it would almost be  like like uh  years back doing  a rocky horror  too you know  after because that  got such cult  status uh  really taking a  chance you know  yeah but um  we could have  really fucked it  up but i think  it came out  pretty damn  good uh  jenna thanks  for taking the  fun out of the  show today  yeah thanks for  doing that real  serious cool  question that  they've been  asked a thousand  times  all over america  promoting clerks  too the reviews  are out there  guess what's in  your pants  right this is the

[03:37:30]  the fish's teeth  were better than  his it was  it was kind of  sad  did they explain  the fish with  the human teeth  yeah they explained  what it was  what was it  it was a type of  fish i didn't  fucking do a  book report on it  i actually did  see the story  no you didn't  shut up  i did  stop it  shut up  shut up  shut up  shut up  shut up  you didn't  he's a liar  all the time  it had  it had  human teeth  we said that  that's right  and um  what else  dr zell caught it  turns out the lady 
[03:38:00]  that stuck the finger  in the chili did it  here's the story  scott curry  has caught  thousands of fish  above the springs  lake  but none  like this  with this  good  that is  i have no idea  what it is  i could find out  curry knew his  catch was something  special  from the time  he hooked it  took a long time  for us to  get it in  it's a guy  we had a fit  you know

[03:39:00]  you might want  to check the quality  of the water  down there  between his voice  and the fish  with the human teeth  something's going on  yeah  you know  we didn't want  to lose it  his face  the line was  going to  crank on us  after reeling  in the 20 pounder  curry realized  it wasn't a typical catch  satan's interviewing  this one  had teeth  i haven't seen  anything like it  in all the  36 years  i've never seen  a fish like that  come out of this lake  internet searches show  it might be a  paku  a fish familiar 
[03:39:30]  to south america  or a chambakui  one of the most  valuable commercial fish  in the amazon  that looks like  maybe somebody  turned something loose  a game warden  has taken pictures  and will try to  identify the mystery  fish in the next  few days  i don't think  i don't know  what it is  i don't know  what it is  see now  playing poker  with a monkey  seems pretty  edward  our murrow type  you know  work man  compared to the  toothy fish  yeah  you guys want to  hear the greatest  one ever  can we get the  leprechaun

[03:40:30]  hear from a news  program  curiosity leads  to large crowds  in mobile's  crichton community  does it  many of you  bring binoculars  camcorders  even camera phones  to take pictures  to me  it look like a  leprechaun to me  i gotta do it  look up in the tree  who else  in the leprechaun  say yeah  yeah  eyewitnesses say  the leprechaun  only comes out at night  if you shine a light  in its direction  it suddenly disappears  this amateur sketch  resembles what many of you  say the leprechaun looks like 
[03:41:00]  it looked like an acorn  others find it hard to believe  and have come up with their own  theories and explanations  for the image  my theory is  it's casting a shadow  from the other limb  could be a crackhead  got on for the wrong stuff  and told him to get up in the tree  and play a leprechaun  one of the sykes  yes, be it on there  guy, don't be afraid  don't be afraid, man  this guy  helping to direct traffic  says he's prepared 
[03:41:30]  for his encounter  with the leprechaun  he's suited up  from head to toe  this war is all smells  right here  this is a special  leprechaun flute  which has been passed down  from thousands of years ago  from my great great  grandfather who was Irish  the leprechaun flute  others just came to get lucky  in hopes a pot of gold  may be buried  under this tree  I'm gonna run a backhoe  and uproot that tree  I wanna know where to go  I want the gold  give me the gold  I want the gold  oh shit  there goes Donald's tree farm 
[03:42:00]  they're gonna be fucking uprooting everything  oh it does Oregon  General Mills buries a fucking box of tricks  under there  we did it  we brought it back  what a publicity stunt  holy shit  imagine that  always after me lucky times  imagine that  poor fucking newscaster  drinking after that one  it could have been a crackhead  I did  I have to watch reports from Beirut  and I sit there with the leprechaun  Steve just came in  and there's something in front of me  I have no idea  but this could be a good segue 
[03:42:30]  from what we just heard  the urbanized O&A promo  yeah it's a new direction  from you?  I don't want to take entirely  all the credit for it  in other words  if it sucks  don't blame me  entirely  the pass the buck thing  that all these guys got going  is fantastic  no no no no  no no no  no no no  wow  no no no no  when people come in  with something we haven't heard yet  we go  so who came up with this?  well I got an email to me  by that guy 
[03:43:00]  but he found it somewhere  but the minute it's good  yeah  that was mine  that was mine  this is actually done  in the spirit of keeping it fair  because it's not voiced by me  my voice isn't even on it  it's two guys  plausible deniability  exactly  thank you very much  this is my attempt  to try to involve  he's got me  I'm trying to get  Wild Bill more involved  in the promos  you've got a new tight shirt  I say too  yeah  it's nice  we're loving it  kids wearing mediums  I am  actually I'm only down  to larger  that's kids mediums  that's terrible  I'm sorry 
[03:43:30]  I know  here's some of Steve's acting  from a sketch  yeah we got big actors  I know  a sketch  that was put together  with him  and this guy  Wild Bill  who's one of our interns  nice  and here's some  of Steve's acting  this is Bill  enters his house  very angry  and Steve wants to know  what Bill is doing  in his house  here's the line  what are you doing  in my house  is that fantastic  dude you could be in clerks  I know  I was just gonna say  now listen to this  sing-songy delivery  of him actually 
[03:44:00]  now really pissed  about Bill being  in his house  what's my problem  you're in my  fucking house  brought to you  by Whambo  yeah  what's your problem  my agent just called  there's a cabin  with a monkey in it  now here's him  his wife comes in  wants to know  what the ruckus is  here's him dismissing  his wife  this is actually really good  casually  you know  dismissing her  and he'll take care of it  no  nothing's wrong  just stay in the living room 
[03:44:30]  I'll handle it  you can hear the  exasperation  he's really good at that  that's good  no  because this is the way  you talk to your wife  while there's a home  invasion happening  now here's a very angry  Steve telling Bill  to leave  get the fuck out  now  clinch cheese  get the fuck out now  that's right  I don't know what  this one was for  why not  why not  I can't leave  someone said  you should never  talk into a microphone  again  why not  and then  probably the worst 
[03:45:00]  delivery ever  of sympathy  Bill tells Steve  he's there  because his parents  died  and  here's Steve's response  with all the emotion  of somebody  trying to comfort  somebody  that just told them  their parents  just died  how'd your parents die  he got all broke  back on that  delivery  how'd your parents die  how'd your parents die  I've heard more emotional  dewy decibel system  explanations  that was really bad 
[03:45:30]  and then the other one  you forgot  our favorite one  which  no the first thing  he said was  oh  that's terrible  I'm sorry  that was a response  to the parents die  and of course  when he doesn't agree  with something  no no no no  no no no  which is perfect  and he's a big bear  of a guy  so  grr  some growling  grr  and here's a little song  when he comes in the studio  we used to play this  grr  I could see that one 
[03:46:00]  catching on  yeah I know  it's kind of catchy  that's stuck in your head  that's the bad part  so what's the latest  thing here Steve  what have you come up  with now  in an effort to appeal  to a broader demographic  maybe like an urban  demographic  I've brought in  external voices  like Bronx Johnny  who's an Ecuadorian  kid who works  Ron and Fez  yeah he works on  Ron and Fez  and he's buddies  with our own  Wild Bill  and it allowed me 
[03:46:30]  to bring Wild Bill  into a promo  but not give him  complete control  because when I do that  he writes crazy things  that you take part in  yes  I'm really just trying  to be proud  okay yes  this is one of our  favorite things by the way  when he explains  his promo  yeah  most stations  just play the promo  and you don't think  twice about it  I know  Steve's got to give  you an accurate  explanation  the promo's a very  minor part of this  I could tell  it's kind of like  Jim's question  about acting  exactly  can you tell  we've got to do  at least five hours  of radio  yeah exactly 
[03:47:00]  maybe it's time  to cut down the show  a little bit  go ahead Steve  so we  thought of this  concept of  Bronx Johnny  was going to  intro the Opie and  Anthony show  but he gets a little  distracted halfway  through the promo  and I'm wondering  if this is going to  catch on  we'll see  maybe it will  maybe it won't  but he gets a little  bit distracted  and he can never  get really through  the promo  because something  maybe catches  his eye  I'm intrigued  so am I  how can you not be  please  I'm missing a plane  for this  indeed 
[03:47:30]  you missing your flight  I'm very close  sweetie  oh really  I gotta hear this  I'm not going anywhere  until I hear this  press the god damn  button  here we go  yo what's good  you listening to  the Opie and Anthony  show right now  what's poppin  coming up on today's  show we got  we got  we got  wow  bill what is that  yo  that's a $30,000  Pro Tools rig  oh damn  yo  yo how's that on there  man is that  boats it down  something like that  not anymore 
[03:48:00]  yo Bill run that  under your shirt man  what happened  nobody's taking credit  for that bit  alright  yeah  you know what  might help it though  if you drop that  could have been a crackhead  line in there  that might jazz it up  a little  am I gonna laugh  or I'm gonna  uproot that tree  what um  what are you promoting  melatonin  what happened  ambient actually 
[03:48:30]  was that a bomb  that was a bomb  was it a bomb  well he was  stealing  wow it was a  monumental flop  he was  heaven's gate  yeah  he was stealing  the equipment  that he's used  to make  to record  the promo  right  yeah  man you know what  you know what  I say  we give it another  listen  because a lot of  times we  prejudge things  it would be  funnier if  Steve came in  and said  what are you  doing to my  studio  I say we get  that chick 
[03:49:00]  back on the  line that  wanted to  talk about  Joel Siegel  in Cleveland  right  add her in  now you're  talking excitement  because everybody  in the urban  market knows  about Pro Tools  yeah  no one knows  what Pro Tools  is  I was actually  going to go  with Pro Tools  or 5 Laptops  and I couldn't  figure out  let me tell you  something  no one  outside of the  industry  knows what  Pro Tools  is  and then  hearing a  drill  they might  think that  it's a  professional  tool  being used  but not  know what  Pro Tools  like no one  knows what  Pro Tools 
[03:49:30]  can we give it  another listen  I'm serious  I think we should  give it a chance  Pro Bar makes it  another chance  you want to play  it again  I say we do  I say we shouldn't  jump on Steve  he lost it  it wasn't that  good  I want to hear  it again  we shouldn't  jump all over  it just because  it stinks  I pulled my  gum off  you don't want  to get the  gum in there  yo what's good  you listening to  Hoping Anthony  show right now 
[03:50:00]  what's poppin  coming up on  today's show  we got  we got  we got  wow  bill what is  that yo  that's a  $30,000  Pro Tools  rig  an editing thing  for rap records  yo how's that  on in  is that  Boats It Down  or something  like that  rough you  by the wall  not anymore  yo bill run  that under  your shirt  man  what happened  that's terrible  I'm sorry  I knew that  was coming  I knew that  was coming  I love the part  because he said  it's Boated Down  you can't understand 
[03:50:30]  what he's saying  it's Boated  yeah Boated Down  well it's  to appeal to the  urban audience  no no I know  I just couldn't  understand what he said  alright let's  you are a flop  yeah  we might have  to get these guys  out of here  I don't want you  guys missing a plane  West Virginia  up for this drivel  what did the Pro Tools  do that distracted  him so much  from this  he just realized  he could make money  off him  oh  I see  such a fine line  between stupid  and genius  could have been  a crackhead  I'd be happy 
[03:51:00]  to catch a Russian  plane after this  Denise  hi  hi  hi Denise  I just wanted  to know  if  since Jeff  was a little  jealous  that  the other guy  got a chance  to get with  Rosario Dawson  if he likes  a little of the  darkness  and if he'd like  to go out  sometime  damn I don't have  to catch a plane  after all  where you at  no you're going  to have to catch  a plane  to West Virginia  West Virginia  oh shit  I don't go  to West Virginia

[04:00:30]  week of the  film being out  and download a  commentary track  to your iPod  and go back  to the theater  so if you start  seeing people  with earphones  in the theater  are you kidding  holy shit  you can actually  hear the behind  the scenes  that is  fucking  brilliant  I'm fucking  smart  for a groundbreaking  fucking movie  you're gonna  wanna know  what the fuck  really happened  during the donkey  show  that is  brilliant  how do you  get people  to go see  a movie  twice  they've been  trying to  do that  for years  fucking commentary  in the movie  that's right  that is  brilliant  we don't  fuck around  who thought  of that shit  come on  really  Kevin  it was 
[04:01:00]  you  I would  take credit  for it  however it was  how are they  going to sync  it up  there's a  cue tone  there's a  cue tone  when you start  opening credits  there's a  countdown  doesn't really  matter  because  we stray  into some  territory  it was actually  a very funny  comment  you're gonna  fuck it  no one's gonna  happen with that  I'm playing this  out of my head  you're gonna  fuck it up  for so many  people in the  theater that are  just watching  the movie  and you guys  are gonna be  laughing  because you're  gonna be  telling some  sick fucking  story  that has  nothing  someone's  gonna be  laughing their  balls off  it's gonna  be silent  and then 
[04:01:30]  those people  have to go  see it again  because they're  gonna miss  half the shit  it's genius  that and the  fact that on  MySpace  being added to  the credits  if you go to  the MySpace  site  the Clerks 2  MySpace  you get added  to the credits  so you can  sit there  and watch  your name  on the credits  probably like  the size  of a pin  that commentary  thing man  you guys  just started  something  no other  movies  done it  right  no movies  done it  that's gonna  take off  the only thing  I can think
