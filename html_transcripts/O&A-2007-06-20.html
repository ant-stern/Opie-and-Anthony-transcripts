<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a defiant proclamation of their shock jock status, rejecting the notion of "nice" radio.  They immediately launched into "Whip Em Out Wednesday," showcasing listener submissions via Paltalk, including women flashing.  A substantial portion focused on an email from E-Rock alleging a $100 million lawsuit against Howard Stern by Kelly Lockwood, promising the delivery of secret documents.  These documents never appeared, leading to much mockery of E-Rock, who'd been duped by a notoriously unreliable cab driver ("Cabby"). The show also discussed their failure to secure an exclusive on the leaked O.J. Simpson book, "If I Did It."

A listener, Carlton, then called in with another potential scoop for E-Rockâ€”Roger Clemens's return to the Yankees.  The show heavily featured a phone interview with Dale Rippey, a 62-year-old who'd strangled a rabid bobcat.  Rippey detailed the attack, his calm demeanor during the event, his telephone company background, and his Vietnam service, all punctuated by humorous banter with the hosts.  The arrival of Louie C.K. in studio shifted the focus back to their failed O.J. Simpson book scoop, ending the segment on a note of frustration at repeatedly missing out on breaking news.

The discussion of O.J. Simpson's book continued with Louie C.K., delving into its graphic descriptions of the hypothetical murders, including explicit details of blood and body positioning. They debated whether it was a disguised confession or a testament to Simpson's writing ability, speculating about the mysterious "Charlie" character (possibly Al Cowlings) and the plausibility of various details.  The segment concluded with a description of their "room raid" on another radio show's Paltalk room, detailing the resulting online chaos and insults.

A subsequent segment featured a phone call with Marge from Little Shelter, an animal shelter. After mocking Mike North's awards, the conversation devolved into absurdity, with Marge requesting Viagra for a dog and the hosts suggesting increasingly outrageous and often abusive fundraising schemes.  The conversation became sexually suggestive and vulgar, involving discussions of Marge's sex life and the hosts' inappropriate proposals, all with Louie C.K.'s participation.  The segment transitioned to discussion of Louie C.K.'s HBO special, followed by more vulgar banter, including descriptions of an upcoming wedding and "Butt Rub Wednesday," involving two male staff members.  The segment ended with ribbing of a new intern and further crude, sexually charged conversations.

The show continued with sexually explicit calls. Craig shared several graphic anecdotes involving himself and friends, while Hootie McBoob recounted a party where men watched her and another woman engage in sexual acts. Further calls followed with similar content, interspersed with audio of a mother cursing at a hockey game. The conversation shifted to Louie C.K.'s upcoming DVD, including anecdotes about interactions with Jimmy Norton and Alan Alda.  The hosts brainstormed a segment, "So Your Vagina Has Talent," involving Rube Goldberg-esque contraptions and a "jizz olympics," discussing it with a producer and receiving a call from a listener volunteering for the "jizz races."  The segment concluded with a call from Stalker Patty, detailing her peep show experience and reaction to a pornographic movie, followed by sexually charged dialogue with the hosts and a final anecdote about a producer getting peanut butter on his anus.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  The biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Charles Nelson Reilly takes it up the blank.  The blank.  Can I call a friend and maybe get some aid with this?  Oh, wow.  This is where entertainment is going. 
[00:01:00]  I'm starting to suspect my parents are swingers.  I think your dad's just a watcher.  He just sits in the corner nude.  And all sorts of horrific things are happening to your mom.  They are sick.  Don't you ever do that.  I understand the concept of the syllable.  You don't have to beat it into me with your belt.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  It is.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Wednesdays are fun for us.  By the way, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Because the girls like Flash all morning long on Pal Talk.  Yep.  Did you see in the paper the other day that all the radio stations are jumping on the  Pal Talk bandwagon?  Yeah, I did see that. 
[00:02:00]  And in their press releases, they're like, we're one of the first radio stations to bring  Pal Talk to our radio show.  How can you be one of the first?  You're either the first or you ain't one of the first.  And they make believe, oh, hey, we came up with this great idea.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell the people where you came up with the idea from?  It's going to be great.  We're going to have video conferencing where our listeners are able to actually interact  with us via video. 
[00:02:30]  Really?  Wow.  We've been doing that for two and a half years.  That's new.  A couple of years anyway.  New and exciting.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America, so it's whipping out Wednesday.  Yeah.  We're excited for that because like what I just said, the girl's flashing on Pal Talk.  Yep.  I see some of the girls.  Oh, lights are coming on in bedrooms as they're sleeping.  Hey, you were sleeping topless yesterday.  What happened?  Where are you looking at girls?  I wouldn't see any.  Why would you?  Why would that monitor be on? 
[00:03:00]  Well, you know, E-Rock didn't turn your screen on because he's a little distracted today.  Why?  What's the matter, E-Rock?  Oh, wow.  He's waiting for deep throat.  Deep stomach.  He's waiting for deep stomach.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock makes it so easy sometimes.  Piece of cake.  I guess we all eat it.  I guess we got.  Oh, look.  Travis has to run in with the actual email.  All right.  Here it is.  So we get this email. 
[00:03:30]  Man, I hope you're awake because the next half hour is going to be just terrific.  I did get this.  It's actually one of the one.  You did?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  So late last night, we got an email from our own E-Rock.  It's to the entire staff.  I see me.  I see Anthony.  I see Jimmy.  I see Steve.  I see the fan and Danny and Travis and Danny and Not Sam and Derek.  It just goes on and on.  So E-Rock thought he had something, and maybe he does. 
[00:04:00]  Who knows?  But he sent this top-secret email to everybody.  It reads, Cabby just called me and said that there will be an announcement tomorrow.  I don't know.  This is missing something.  What happened?  The read is kind of missing something.  What do you need?  Music?  Yeah.  All right.  Hit it.  Cabby just called me to tell me that there will be an announcement tomorrow that Howard  will be sued for $100 million by Kelly Lockwood of H57 Hootia. 
[00:04:30]  He said he was leaving something under the door of our office and in the studio for us.  Heads up to those who get in first to look for whatever this might be.  I have his phone numbers if we need to talk to him tomorrow.  Apparently, he had a big fallout with Howard.  Wow.  I'll tell you what this email is missing.  Who cares?  And I'll tell you what it shouldn't have is quotes around need to talk to him.  Need to talk to him.  What is that like a euphemism for?  Have sex? 
[00:05:00]  If we, quote, need to talk to him, unquote.  Yeah, that's what people do when need to talk to him would mean, like, you got to work him  over.  You know, we need to talk to him.  Yeah, but I think people use punctuation.  Perhaps a bit more.  People use punctuation just to kind of jazz up what they're saying.  They get a little nervous.  They're like, man, there's nothing really cool in this sentence.  I got to, like, get quotations or something.  Maybe a comma over here.  I don't know.  Just to jazz it up.  So I read this, and I was all excited to come in and see this dossier that was going 
[00:05:30]  to be left under the door of our office and the studio.  Something that will set the radio world on fire, the world in general on fire.  Yeah.  I wanted to see, like, a dossier slid under the door on the security cameras by some  guy in a dark cloak.  Yeah.  And then E-Rock can get it without tripping off alarms by having a crane lower him down. 
[00:06:00]  He's not amused.  Yeah.  E-Rock, why aren't you amused?  Yeah, what happened?  Honestly, I really don't even care about this.  He calls me late last night.  He's nervous.  He's drinking.  Yes.  He was all excited about it.  So I sent the email out to everybody.  I was saying he's leaving something under the door or in the studio, and he didn't do 
[00:06:30]  either of it.  And I just passed the info along.  That's all I did.  Passed the info along.  Why'd you put quotes around, Ethan?  I have his number.  Because I didn't think we'd need to talk to him, really.  But why the quotes?  Why not just say if we need to talk to him?  Why is there quotes like that means something else?  I don't know.  It was late.  So we all get in this morning, easily an hour to hour and a half ago, and we're all just  sitting around the office.  And finally, around 530, I just make the announcement.  So where are the secret documents?  Where are the documents?  And I go, why don't we get E-Rock in here? 
[00:07:00]  So E-Rock comes in, and he's like, what?  You didn't get him?  What?  Like, you'd think he would be the guy that follows up to make sure the secret documents  were in hand.  He actually came in like all annoyed and went, like, what do you want?  We want the secret documents.  Here's some audio tape from the hallway last night, though.  This might mean something.  Ah, someone was tiptoeing in, and there they go out.  I think they must have seen something that alerted them, and they shouldn't drop off these 
[00:07:30]  top secret documents.  No, that was the audio of just the overnight board op.  He thought, there he goes.  He's going into our office.  He thought he misplaced a tool CD.  And there he goes.  And there he goes with the tool CD to get it on the air.  Is he going to slide the crop reports to you in a garage?  Love that movie.  What's orange juice concentrate going for?  Do you think I would allow a mayonnaise-eating idiot to run our company?  That's brilliant.  Well, Jimmy, here it is. 
[00:08:00]  One dollar.  So no top secret stuff was delivered to the Opie and Anthony show.  So disappointing.  And it's not that top secret.  It's in the paper today.  Yeah, it was in the post anyway.  And then I got another email that the O.J. Simpson book was leaked to us personally, and  I got excited about that, thinking, wow, someone is really inside and is a fan of the Opie and  Anthony show, and then I see, no, it was released to the internet, the papers, it's pretty much  the top story on TV today. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, yeah, it's out there all over the place.  Just once, I want something that we get first.  So the cabbie thing, E-Rock, you got to stop.  You know, I mean, we see him in the hallways here from time to time.  He seems like a nice guy, but he will always be faithful to Howard Stern.  Always.  He teases like he's had fallouts with him and he needs to come on our show and he's going  to give us all sorts of dirt on Howard and the crew.  Like, go away.  That guy would turn on us in a second. 
[00:09:00]  I keep it very polite with the guy in the hall.  Yeah.  That is it.  And as far as secret documents, there are no secret documents.  Is she really suing him over comments made about cabbie and the weight loss thing?  I think so.  Oh, my God.  That's.  Well, you got to explain, Jimmy.  That's what.  Just read that.  It's like.  It's what.  It's what?  Keep your mouth shut. 
[00:09:30]  No, I see.  The lines were funny.  Like, it's ridiculous that you would sue over something like funny lines.  Hmm.  Well, I think Jimmy's on to something in a way.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I mean, it's.  Well, I would like to say that Anthony Cumia perhaps should not be included in any future  lawsuits that this company might want to engage in or pulling of any money from any company  that might want to advertise.  But no, it's not even a statement about this stuff because this stuff might work really 
[00:10:00]  well.  It's like a bunch of guys tooling on somebody.  I don't think it means like.  It doesn't mean that the product doesn't work.  They're just tooling on some idiot.  It doesn't.  It's like your product is not going to be judged by that, I don't think.  Uh-huh.  Remember how Jim used to sit out of the conversations we would have about certain people or subject  matter?  Yeah.  I'm just going to sit out of this one.  I'm not saying a word.  The lovely.  Here's the beauty.  This is how little I know of what I'm talking about.  It just pointed out to me that he said Kelly is a guy, not a she. 
[00:10:30]  That's the first time I've made that mistake?  Well, anyways, I guess we were supposed to get the big news and we were going to break  into the world that this lawsuit was happening and that and we were going to read secret  documents and then there was going to be more dirt to be phone numbers and if we need  to talk to him, end quote.  So what happened with the delivering of the secret documents?  Yeah.  Maybe you should call him and find out what happened.  Find out what happened.  Because he got you involved in making you look kind of silly. 
[00:11:00]  Kind of.  Silly.  Yeah, completely.  A complete ass.  They got me saying Kelly.  Nobody even has gender listed here.  If your name is Kelly, this should be a gender listing that's to your name.  Certain names.  This guy isn't dependable.  So now he made you look bad, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah, Cabby's not known as the most dependable guy.  I'm just passing along with the information that I got.  Why are you sad?  He's so thirsty. 
[00:11:30]  He's so nervous.  Dan, you got something to add?  Well, there were a few things waiting for me.  I was the first person in the office today.  Yeah.  Cool.  The latest book by Harvey P. Carr.  Is that about this whole scandal?  Uh-huh.  No.  Oh, look it up on CW11.  Look at that.  Major loss.  There's your big story, E-Rock.  Did you send it to the CW11 immediately?  There it is. 
[00:12:00]  There's the top secret story.  Maybe our mole went to the wrong address and went to CW11 and slid it under the door.  Oh, E-Rock.  I love it.  Maybe it was folded up in the T-shirt for Jimmy that somebody sent in.  Oh, right.  That could have happened.  That could have happened.  No.  No.  According to this email I just read, I mean, we were going to just shake up the world a little bit this morning. 
[00:12:30]  This was going to just, oh, be huge.  A big fallout.  There's dirt.  He's been hinting at the whole fallout thing for months now.  Yep.  You see him in the hallway every once in a while, and I keep it very basic with him.  Hi.  How are you?  Are they going to hire you here?  That's about it.  That's about it.  Yeah.  But he keeps hinting that he's got all sorts of dirt.  He wants to come on our show and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, E-Rock, did you bring anything today? 
[00:13:00]  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, okay.  I just wanted to.  Mm-hmm.  What are you checking on, email?  I'm trying to get his number.  I want an update.  You don't have the number?  E-Rock, I want an update because, quite frankly, he makes you look a little bad today.  Retarded.  A little retarded.  And I think you need to kind of defend yourself and go, look, the guys are beating me up.  Pretty good here.  What the hell happened with the secret documents?  Well, the thing is, he was looking at his BlackBerry for, like, the whole discussion.  It's like, well, how hard is it going to see for cabbie? 
[00:13:30]  Look at his number.  What are you, put under Q for safekeeping?  He forgot and looked under taxi.  Oh, he's talking to him right now.  Ah, I hear it.  I heard, hey, what's up?  I look like an ass.  We look like.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, E-Rock.  All right, he's talking to him right now.  He always gets caught up in these things. 
[00:14:00]  You'll, sometimes you, um...  You said you had other stuff for us.  Oh, God.  Here's E-Rock.  I've made an ass of myself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do absolutely nothing around here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I did that.  Oh, I'm embarrassed that I did that.  All right.  Well, E-Rock has hung up the phone.  E-Rock.  Quick.  His phone is dying.  I got to call him on the...  He's on the line. 
[00:14:30]  Your phone is dying.  What has he said so far?  He said, I don't know.  It was supposed to be given to me last night, these, uh, this press release and something  else.  Well, it was given to...  ...incoherently.  Press release?  The news.  We don't need press releases, uh, uh, slid under our door.  We'll just read in the paper.  Yeah, in the paper.  Obviously.  If it's in the paper, that means it was given before yesterday.  Right.  Right.  It was given before 5 p.m., which is the deadline for the stories.  We're like 12 hours.  Yesterday afternoon.  We're getting the press release that, uh, the mainstream media got 12 hours ago. 
[00:15:00]  That's great.  What else do you got for us, uh, that, that, that Howard's leaving terrestrial radio and  going to satellite?  That's fantastic.  As Nixon's resigning, he's coming up with Watergate information.  I think there was a break-in.  So, I wasn't alarmed by the email.  I knew this is exactly what was going to happen.  This is how it's supposed to play out.  Oh, this just in.  Iraq, uh, says that after the Ted Offensive, he says, uh, the Vietnam War is unwinnable. 
[00:15:30]  Wow, this could change, uh, American sentiment on the war.  All right, Iraq is back on the phone?  Yes?  All right, Iraq's, uh, back on the phone.  It is just butter and comfort food.  Pizza.  That's like a bunch of pizza crust with extra cheese.  Could you put the cheese in the crust and then smash it into my face, tape it to your  fist and punch it into my mouth?  But here's the problem with Iraq.  He's very gullible to this type of thing.  He really is.  Just an innocent young boy.  I got the email.  I've been, I've been pretty much sleeping since yesterday's show. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know what the hell happened to me yesterday, but feeling much better today.  I think from the move, I, I got, had some kind of allergic reaction to mold and dust and  my throat was closing up.  Yes.  Mouse, feces, dust.  Who knows?  It's like the hunt of virus.  But since the last time, uh, I saw you guys, I've, I slept pretty much from, uh, 11 yesterday  morning all the way to this morning.  It's already in the paper and on TV.  What?  You hear him?  It's already in the paper and all over TV. 
[00:16:30]  And on TV.  But Iraq gets very gullible to this stuff.  He has a lot.  What?  Iraq.  Make sure he knows you, you know, he made you look bad in front of the boys.  In front of everyone.  In front of everybody.  They look really bad.  They've been, uh, tooling on me since 6 a.m. here.  This is going to replay a bunch in two countries.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're being humiliated.  It's out of the hour.  It's out of the hour.  So, it still isn't resolved.  Just saying, oh, doesn't help. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  Wow.  Look like an idiot.  Yeah.  That's pretty much all you can do at this point.  Feels like a child again.  Grounded white striped shirt.  Hey.  No, but yours is like a man's shirt.  Yeah, thank you.  The difference is the thickness in his white stripes.  Oh, yeah.  He does have it, like.  Those are boy shirts.  Yeah.  That's like Dennis the Menace stripes.  Exactly.  Dennis the Incompetent.  Is Iraq hanging up?  Yeah, I'm still here.  What? 
[00:17:30]  See, Iraq gets gullible, man.  Yeah, he really is.  We'll have to do his call, uh, Iraq with some kind of vague news, and he'll run with it  big time.  I'm glad this is finally being brought to the show.  Absolutely.  Because I, like I said, anyway, I was sleeping all, you know, a lot since the last radio show.  Well.  And I got this email, I read it, and rolled back over and fell asleep.  Is it true?  Iraq's grandfather panicked during the War of the Worlds, uh, show that Orson Welles did?  Sending out actual letters. 
[00:18:00]  I know you were on the studio, because he's telling me apparently about you.  That's why you told it to me.  He's not going to win this.  Why is he trying?  Yes.  It does me no good.  Like, shouldn't you have had it, and then, like, left me a message saying, hey, it's already  in the office, not, I'm going to have something, and then maybe I'll leave it in the office?  He's a fool.  He's, you know, this is like everything that happens when the higher-ups, like, rag on you,  and you need someone else to rag on.  Yeah.  You know, crap flows down, kind of. 
[00:18:30]  I've had it there for you, rather than, I'm waiting to see if I'm going to get it.  And Iraq, uh, he wants to so badly have something.  He wants to.  For the boys, for us.  For lack of a more ridiculous term with him, he wants to have this skinny.  Yeah.  He wants to hand over, like, a secret document and just give you that look like, finally,  I got something.  But he wants us to go, Eric, you did it.  Wow.  Wow.  You did it.  Is that really the Loch Ness Monster video?  You did it.  Fascinating. 
[00:19:00]  It is true.  Hey, Iraq, we've got to take a break.  What's going on over there?  Hold on a second.  What happened?  What's happening?  Well, he says, I don't know what to tell you, because he was supposed to have it by  midnight, and, uh...  Have what?  Whatever this was.  Why don't you ask him?  He doesn't know what it was.  What is it?  He said a press release in something.  That's all he was saying.  Yeah, the press release is in the paper.  What else are we going to do?  It was released to the press.  He gets the post delivered at midnight.  I have something for you.  Wait till the paper comes out. 
[00:19:30]  I'll clip it and mail it to you.  That was.  Maybe it was just the newspaper slid under our door.  By the way, uh...  The info in it.  Our favorite traffic reporter...  Yes, headlights are on from New York City.  Our favorite traffic reporter, Jill Nicolini, had her own headlights on this morning.  Now, that is a traffic report.  Yes, we did see that.  We were going to get to that a little later on this morning.  Oh, I got an email from her.  Thanks, Gabby.  She actually likes the show.  Sure.  Yeah, sure.  Nobody believes me.  Why would Jimmy Norton get the email?  Um, I don't know. 
[00:20:00]  Did she slide a picture of herself under your door?  No, she likes me.  She said that somebody at work tapes the show for her.  She listens and she loves the show.  Let me see the email.  Okay.  How much do you want to bet?  Um...  I'll bet you $5.  Wow.  Jimmy, that's a bet.  Huh.  I'll throw another $5 in.  It's $10.  That'll buy you like, um...  You didn't get no email from her.  I did.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I did.  I did.  She's like, if you want to...  She's telling me I can call her.  Talk.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Nothing.  It wasn't flirty.  It was just friendly.  It was nothing inappropriate.  It was a hello.  I didn't say it was inappropriate or any way.  You emailed before.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did you guys act like you don't email when...  You twitched.  It's over.  I do all the time.  No, no.  You twitch when you're telling lies.  You've become this compulsive liar that, like...  Even if you're telling the truth, you lie so much, it doesn't even matter.  No, you guys don't understand.  Like, I've emailed with a lot of pretty girls before.  There's just one.  Did you send one out to her first? 
[00:21:00]  No, I didn't know her email address.  You could probably get it over at the CW11.  I wouldn't do that.  Did you get an email from her?  I don't believe you.  I did.  She's so full of crap.  I did.  Anyway, she's looking hot on TV this morning.  Yes.  Are we doing that screen cap thing?  Yeah.  We're going to start screen capping this traffic reporter.  She's doing her very long, involved traffic reports.  I'll call her and ask what she thinks about that.  Yeah, do that.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  Do your call now.  I didn't write the number down.  Cappy was going to leave it on something.  Slide it under your door.  D-Rock, you've got to stop hanging with him.  You've got to keep it just very basic.  How are you?  Oh, I hear it's going to rain today in New York.  That type of thing.  Maybe he'll slip up.  You can't trust the guy.  He's not trustworthy.  And his loyalties will always be with Howard.  Do you think he would say it's going to rain, or would he just hint by slipping like a little  dish of rainwater under Eric's door so he could have the scoop? 
[00:22:00]  Poor Eric.  Eric, what's that?  I'm just kidding.  I know.  Go ahead.  He really can't just...  He's embarrassed.  I don't hang with the guy.  I've seen him once.  And when he called me up late last night with his information, I was like, all right.  I passed it along and left it at that.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're just getting started.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.

[00:23:30]  Something like that is easy.  Those are just random numbers, willy-nilly.  The worst numbers possible.  Yes.  It doesn't really spell anything.  A man survives bobcat attack by choking animal to death.  What a man.  This is what I was telling you last week.  That's a man.  The same way Eric survived the chicken attack.  He's going to hit me.  Yeah, he's in a bad mood. 
[00:24:00]  He is in a bad mood today.  We got Carlton from Chicago listening on WCKG.  What's up, Carlton?  Hey, ONA.  I got a scoop for E-Rock.  I'll slide under his door.  Yeah.  The rocket is coming back to the Yankees.  Hey, E-Rock.  How about that?  The Clemens is coming back to the Yankees.  You want to run with that one or what, bro?  That's big news.  Yeah, maybe he could slide something under the door tomorrow that we can break that story.  I just think it's funny that E-Rock's in cahoots with Cabby. 
[00:24:30]  Everyone in the radio world knows what he's about.  You can't trust that guy.  E-Rock's comment, goodness gracious.  All right, here we go.  You've heard.  Man survives bobcat attack by choking animal to death.  Oh, my God.  And I told you you could fight off animals.  Yeah, well.  We were talking about the dog attack last week, and I said you could either choke him out or do something.  Or pull the King Kong T-Rex move where you pull the jaw apart.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not a pit bull, you can't.  No.  Well, I think I can. 
[00:25:00]  The jaw muscles on a pit bull?  Come on.  I want to know how this guy choked out a...  Sure.  62-year-old Florida man depended on his instinct.  How old?  62.  The guy's also 62?  He's diabetic.  Hey, man, 62 is nothing these days.  62 is like 35 back in the day.  62 is nothing, but let me tell you something.  When you're being attacked by a bobcat...  Yeah, you're going to need youth on your side.  Yeah.  Was it just a cat named Bob?  Maybe that was it. 
[00:25:30]  It's a little tabby.  Can you imagine it is, and they just got this whole thing wrong?  Bob the cat.  62.  No, it was a Bob Kelly attack.  Depending on his instincts, when a bobcat attacked him and it paid off, he survived.  The bobcat didn't.  Dale Rippey, a resident of...  Now, can we get this guy on the phone?  I want to talk to Dale Rippey today.  Iraq, have you spoken with Dale Rippey at all last night?  Correspondent, emails, notes passed.  Can I slip a pelt under your door? 
[00:26:00]  Meetings in garages in D.C.  Hold on a minute.  Let's go to Wes in Orlando.  Wes?  Wes?  Yes, what's up, Wes?  Good morning, bu-bu-boys.  Good morning, Wes.  I just want to say that I'm a fancy man, and I'm flying up from Florida to the Boston show.  Can't wait.  The ONH virus comedy show in Boston.  We're a month out at this point.  Yes.  And I want to wake everybody up with my rock scream.  What?  Wes? 
[00:26:30]  What?  You're a big-time listener of the show?  Yes.  Is it Rock Scream Tuesday?  Yep.  I'm ready to hear it.  Wes?  Wes?  Wes?  Yes.  Is it Rock Scream Tuesday?  Dude, it's Rock Scream Wednesday.  No, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  He's got his days all wrong.  We're confusing everybody with all our themes.  You know, I never understood how difficult it was when you hear a bunch of these hacky radio shows that have themes every day. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  How hard it is to keep it together.  Yeah.  People want to call up on a Wednesday and do your Tuesday thing.  Rock, rock, rock, rock.  That's the anarchy.  It's not rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.  It's on Wednesday.  And I hope people realize that we're just goofing on the fact that radio shows that have themes.  Oh, there are people that absolutely believe we do that.  Come on.  Because Thursday alone, I think we have three or four themes for Thursday, including Perv News Thursday. 
[00:27:30]  Perv News.  And then Friday, we got three or four themes as well.  I like Point Laugh.  Point Laugh Friday is a huge hit.  It's also Mispronunciation Friday.  Yeah.  And a few others in there.  And let's not forget, we added Pot Talk Monday.  Yeah, right.  I love Pot Talk Monday.  All right, back to Dale Rippey.  Bubble guy, he's been in the news two days now in New York.  Yeah.  There is this idiot that's been in New York now that blows bubbles.  You know the soap bubbles that you get? 
[00:28:00]  You get the little stick with the little circle at the end and you blow through it and it makes  a bubble.  Are you explaining blowing bubbles?  Yeah, yeah.  Because you know something?  I don't know what people have anymore these days.  I haven't seen bubbles in years.  But this guy has a big hoop and he makes huge bubbles.  Who cares?  He's been in the news two days.  How many people died?  You know, I read there was a huge bombing in Iraq yesterday that killed like 75 people 
[00:28:30]  in a marketplace.  Ah, bubble guy.  Bubble guy, much more important than 75 Iraqis dying.  Exactly.  It's just how it is.  It's just the way it is.  Obviously, it's the way it is because they're not reporting it on the news, but bubble guy  is on there.  If it was some of our boys over there, then of course, that's more important than bubble  guy.  A little more important.  Unfortunately, the news likes reporting it at the end of the story or maybe on page 29  of the paper.  29.  Maybe. 
[00:29:00]  Maybe.  Yeah, bubble guy is all over the tube today.  Stupid bubble guy.  All right.  So we go to Dale Rippey here.  He lives in Florida.  He was pulling trash cans back to his house when he saw what he thought was a large cat.  After realizing the animal was actually a bobcat, he set the trash cans down and prepared  for an attack.  Having grown up on a farm, Rippey said he knew the bobcat would attack when it didn't run  away after seeing him.  When it growled, I knew it was going to jump and bite me, he said.  The animal then jumped on him and began to scratch and bite.  Rippey said he knew if he could get a good hold on the animal, he would be able to choke 
[00:29:30]  it, even if that meant letting the bobcat take a couple of bites.  I started choking it when it got a good hold, he said.  I started choking it when it got a good hold, he said.  I choked it till he died.  I got scratched up pretty good.  Can you imagine?  It's a little thing.  Huh?  It's a cat with long legs.  Bobcats are not little things.  They're little.  It's not a cougar.  It's a bobcat.  He didn't say I thought it was a lion, he said I thought it was a cat. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I thought it was a cat.  It looks like a cat with very long legs.  That bobcat would F you up.  He choked a cat.  Anthony, if a bobcat was in the studio right now, you would run.  Have you seen a bobcat in person?  They're littler than tigers and lions and all that.  Absolutely, cougars.  But they're scary creatures.  You could take on a bobcat.  Sure.  With a gun, I know. 
[00:30:30]  Well, no, I could choke that thing out.  It's a kitten.  Look at the blood on the cat.  What happened?  We got Dale Rippey?  Hey.  Hey, Dale.  Yes, I'm here.  Mr. Rippey.  You're talking to the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you, sir?  I'm doing fine, thank you.  I see the blood all over your t-shirt.  Yeah, I had gotten cleaned up pretty well before any pictures were taken.  Did the bobcat rip out your vocal cords? 
[00:31:00]  No, not really.  No?  He stayed clear of your face?  Because that's like the area of the neck and the face that you want to...  Yeah, I kept him...  He only managed to get one paw up over my shoulder, and I got a scratch on my back, but I held  him down, his head just above waist high while I was choking him.  And so, mostly he got my legs, as far as scratches, I got my legs and my arms and...  He did that kick thing?  Did they do that back leg kick thing? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  He was really...  You know, once I let him get a good bite on him, or once I let him get a good bite in  my stomach where he would hold still, and then I grabbed him around the neck and was holding  him, and I held him there really, really, you know, tightly because I didn't want him  getting me down or anything.  How big was it?  Because it's like we can't tell from the photo how large this thing was.  I'd say it was probably, just guessing, near 25 pounds. 
[00:32:00]  25 pounds, okay.  Yeah.  And he bit into your stomach.  Now, what kind of hand strength do you got?  What do you do for a living?  Or did?  Are you retired?  I've worked for the telephone company for 37 years.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Alignment or something?  What do you do, collections?  No, no, no.  No, I'm basically working on the central office environment, the inside switching environment. 
[00:32:30]  Why did you think he would attack you?  Like, why wouldn't an animal like that just run away?  Well, when I saw the animal and it didn't run, I knew something was wrong.  And I was raised on the farm and knew, you know, I know about animals.  So, and then it growled and then I thought, well, you know, I'm going to get bitten, I'm  going to get scratched.  So, I braced myself because he jumped and then I waited for a second until he got still  enough that I knew that when I grabbed him, I knew I only had one chance to grab him. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  And so, I grabbed him and got him around the neck and choked him.  I had a hit in my garbage pails.  Yeah, why didn't you just throw the garbage can?  I would have thrown the garbage can and then went, ah, and ran away screaming.  Yeah, doesn't noise scare him?  That would have been the very worst thing to do because he would have chased me down and  I wouldn't have had a chance then because that was a rabid animal.  Oh, really?  So, now you might have some rabies there.  No, I've been taking shots for several weeks. 
[00:33:30]  Wow, that thing has had rabies?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they didn't say that in the story.  Yeah, it was rabid.  Well, that's why it attacked, right?  That's why it attacked me.  Because I think the instinct of the animal is to run away when they see humans in general.  So, if this thing is going to attack you, yeah, the rabies gets you all crazed up.  Makes you crazy.  Wow.  You're foaming at the mouth there, Dale, or what?  Yeah, I didn't notice that.  I don't know if it had been foaming at the mouth or not, but I knew that something was 
[00:34:00]  definitely wrong with it when it didn't run when it saw me.  Now, so you're choking this thing out and it's putting up a fight.  When did you realize you had him?  And did he start, like, just nodding off and you were like, man, I got this guy?  Right, well, after a while, you know, his scratching and wiggling around become a lot less.  You know, he just got weaker and weaker and weaker.  But I kept a choke hold on him for quite a while after he was completely limp because 
[00:34:30]  I wanted to make sure he wasn't just unconscious.  Right.  And so I had a choke on him for over a minute, for sure.  And were you yelling anything?  Like, you know.  No, I was, like I say, I've been around animals all my life and I was pretty calm about the  whole thing.  I'd have just gone, ah, I'm Dale Ripley, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, and just, like, choke him 
[00:35:00]  out and make some noise.  Any neighbors around you or, ah?  Yeah, I went next door and got George, who's my really good neighbor, and George and Barbara.  Ah, good old George and Barbara helping you out.  God bless George and Barbara, yeah.  Hey, if they were good friends, they would have been there without you asking, Dale.  Remember that?  Right.  Yeah, that's for sure.  Old George and Barbara, the swingers.  I love George and Barbara.  Yeah, Barbara is the one that made the call for the, you know, so the police and animal 
[00:35:30]  control came out, and of course, animal control came out and bagged up the cat and sent it  off to get it tested.  Have you ever seen Barbara naked?  No.  No.  I haven't.  Oh, oh, what?  Did they brag that their son's the president?  Sorry, I didn't hear that last part.  George and Barbara.  I didn't realize that.  Yes.  George and Barbara, you know, the bushes that live next door.  Very good.  Well, Dale, that's very brave of you.  Yes, very brave.  Wow, you really got a hold of that situation? 
[00:36:00]  No pun intended.  A lot of people might have panicked.  Now, the animal rights activists, are they coming after you?  Uh, I hope not.  Well, some people would be, I think, pissed off that you choked down an animal there, Dale.  And like I say, you know, I have, I've had animals all my life.  I love animals, and it was, you know.  Animals all your life.  Have you ever choked a chicken?  We had to eat.  I was raised on the farm.  On the farm.  Yeah, you got to. 
[00:36:30]  You take them, you grab them by the neck.  What's the largest animal?  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Dale.  What's the largest animal you've ever been attacked by?  Um, I had a hog run me down one time that was pretty large.  A what?  No, she was trying to get out of my hotel room.  No, that's when I was on the farm, though, and I was a child at the time, and a big hog  ran me down and ran over me, and it hurt pretty bad.  Wow.  That's the biggest animal. 
[00:37:00]  Were you scared of this thing, or no?  Because I would just panic and run.  You weren't really afraid?  No, not really, because I knew what was going to happen.  And the first thing I thought, when it growled, I said, well, I'm going to get bitten.  I'm going to get scratched.  I know.  You said that.  Yeah, that's great.  Now, Dale, I mean, some people are saying 25-pound cat is nothing.  It's a joke.  I mean, can a bobcat kill a man?  Well, yeah, I'm sure they could, you know, because especially a rabid bobcat, you know,  they're not going to stop.  They're going to keep going because they're insane. 
[00:37:30]  He's got the rabies.  He's got a crazy cat.  How far were you from, like, a door where you could run in?  You said you were out?  No, I was coming up to the back door.  That bobcat was probably sitting within five or six feet of my back door.  Oh.  So you could have just went inside, Dale.  No, he was between...  Even at 62, that's not much of a challenge.  No, he was between me and the door.  Oh, yeah.  Why did you say, excuse me, I'm trying to walk through here, and he would have moved? 
[00:38:00]  I don't think the bobcat would have done that, Jimmy.  Why didn't you just do the shh, shh, shh, under its chin?  Oh, they all fall for that, all the cats.  You scratch them under the chin, and he'd go...  He started scratching first.  Hey, did you hear...  See that?  I hear there's a...  This should be a movie or something in this for you.  I don't think so.  Why not?  No, huh?  You getting a lot of phone calls?  Yes, I've gotten several. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you, Dale, you're all, man.  I love it.  You took him down.  You're like John Locke from Lost.  Yes.  The guy's just all man-choking out animals, being run down by boars.  Did you just make a Lost reference?  Speaking of boars, Dale, we'd like to thank you for calling in.  And this is wonderful.  It's a great story today in the news.  It's a feel-good story.  Yeah.  Is it feel-good story Wednesday?  I don't remember.  Yes, it is.  Yes, feel-good story Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  When is feel-good story day? 
[00:39:00]  Well, you know, the big thing...  Oh, yes.  Oh, go ahead, Dale.  Yes, Dale.  Yeah, let's bore the audience a little more.  Yes, Dale.  Yeah, the big thing is that people realize that things can and do happen like this, and they  need to be aware.  And, you know, if it had been a small...  Boring.  Yeah.  And that's the reason...  Boring.  Yeah, I know.  Right.  No, that's true.  That's Eric.  That's true.  Yeah.  That's Eric.  He's a wise-ass. 
[00:39:30]  Dale.  You're...  So you're doing a public service now about how to defend yourself from bobcats, because  this happens every time.  Well, they've been bullying us for so many years.  It's about time.  I know.  Dale.  Sir.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Do you have any for the thing, Dale?  No, I didn't have anything else to say.  No, no.  Well, the thing was, Dale, because what you did was...  I know that I get very instinctively very frightened.  Do you feel that most people, in a situation like that, I mean, would the instinct at first... 
[00:40:00]  I mean, obviously, there's a whole flea thing, but would that be where it came from, or is  it not about that for many times?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I really...  I didn't hear you well.  I didn't understand.  This sucks.  All right.  Well, Jimmy, again.  Yeah, did you, like, because most people's instinct would be to run away.  I think it was very brave, but do you feel that it was your instinct, or, like, would  there not have been that type of a reaction, say, had the cat been, like, from over there, 
[00:40:30]  but not yet where you are?  Yeah.  Under those circumstances, brother.  Well, it's...  No, no, no, no, no.  It wasn't actually instinct.  It was more...  I attribute it more to my being raised on the farm and handling...  Boring.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, and, uh, because I knew it was going to happen...  Boring.  Yeah.  Shut up!  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, it's an exciting story for today.  Uh, thank you.  I love it.  Do you have a family there, uh, Dale? 
[00:41:00]  You betcha.  Been married 42 years.  Oh, God bless.  God bless.  Oh, did you see that shirt?  I'm sure they're very proud.  Yeah, everyone is, uh, everyone is...  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Uh, Dale, so, you're married 42 years, huh?  You're a brave man.  Your wife must be very proud of you.  Did she's...  What was her, uh, comments about it?  Yeah.  Well, she was real...  He's a fake.  No.  Anyway, uh... 
[00:41:30]  Wow, I'm being married that long.  Hey, how many times did you want to, uh, choke the wife out, right?  Hey, you know, you know what I mean, though.  You know, you could be in love, and still there are some of those days where the wife's  like a bobcat, I bet, right?  Well, she can hear what I'm saying, so I better not say...  Ah, you're a smart man, Dale.  You're a smart man.  I'm about to strangle you.  Definitely.  I'm about to strangle you unconsciousness.  That was Dale with the bobcat.  Right.  Great.  Are you a drinker, Dale? 
[00:42:00]  Uh, no.  No?  Uh, I'd have put down some whiskey after that.  I would have needed a few pops before I attempted to, you know, choke out a bobcat.  What was the first thing you did after you realized that you had, you know, kind of like  raped and killed a bobcat?  Uh, well...  You do realize that bobcat's not going back to its little bobcat family because of you,  right?  Well, he wasn't anyway, Opie.  He had the rabies.  Right, right, right.  So, like, I'm starting to interrupt you.  I've never done that.  Like, say, all right, you rape and kill the bobcat.  What's next?  Uh, what's next in the, in the life of, uh, Dale? 
[00:42:30]  I had to go down to the doctor's office and, uh, have the doctor check me all out and they  gave me, uh, prescription for antibiotics and everything.  Yeah, the prostate.  I know.  That's, oof.  Do all the paperwork with, uh, you know, that kind of thing.  Huh.  A lot of people on Instant Feedback are asking if, uh, you, Dale, actually, uh, bored the  bobcat to death.  Now, choke yourself.  Now, lean forward and choke yourself.  You're a bar fighter, Dale? 
[00:43:00]  You seem like you're pretty ready to go at any...  Yeah, did you ever, you ever scrap as a younger man in the bars or something or in the military  or anything like that?  Yeah, I, I was in the, I was in, in the service and, uh...  Savage animal!  Oh, where were you?  In Vietnam.  You were in the Nam?  God bless you, Dale.  Did you, were you in any of the, uh, what they call the, uh, the, uh, you know, the, uh,  it's, it's a bad word.  Yeah, I...  The S, the S-H stuff, were you in any of that? 
[00:43:30]  Uh, I was there three years, so I saw a lot more than I needed to see.  Yeah, I bet.  My dad was over in Nam.  He led a charge.  He's very proud.  He led a charge in My Lai.  And they took care of a lot of business there.  Uh, whereabouts in Vietnam were you stationed?  Uh, uh, I'm, I, I have, like, another station or two I think that's gonna call you at this  morning.  Oh!  Okay, you can answer any questions you want at this point.  Sure.  Sure.  That's good.  You ever, uh, on a, uh, patrol boat on a river and a tiger attacked you? 
[00:44:00]  Uh, I've been up, uh, I was actually in the Navy, but we were actually up the rivers  of, uh, north, uh, Vietnam, north of the DMZ.  Nice.  So were you in the jungle or were you, were you on a boat?  Just kind of protecting things.  No, I was always on the ship.  Always on the ship.  Yeah.  Basically, you took a cruise while our boys were.  You went, you went up the rivers, right?  Yes, we were.  Yeah, a few patrols up the rivers.  Yeah.  Yeah, you saw some stuff.  Well, Dale did a clubbed cruise while the boys were in the jungle. 
[00:44:30]  This guy saw some stuff.  Fighting white tigers.  All right, Dale.  Thank you very much.  Uh, it's a very interesting thing that happened to you there.  Okay.  You're a brave man.  That's good.  You are.  You're a brave man.  I like that.  Uh, your military background.  You're kicking some ass still with these, uh, wild cats.  Uh, you're a good man, Dale Ripley.  What kind of animal will you fight next?  Uh, whatever comes out of the woods.  All right.  That's good.  Good luck, buddy. 
[00:45:00]  Okay.  All right, Dale.  Okay.  You take care now.  I will.  Thank you for...  That's really...  Thank you.  Thanks.  Ladies and gentlemen, Dale Ripley.  That's good.  Uh...  Uh...  He's a great guy.  That's a great American story.  Yeah.  Hey, the guy was in the NAMM.  You leave him alone.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  There you go.  Choking out a bobcat, huh?  25 pounds.  Choked out a cat?  That's a pretty big animal.  25 pounds.  But a regular cat going, like... 
[00:45:30]  Scares me.  Jimmy, you just scared me doing that.  I don't like...  If I go to pet a cat, like, a lot of times, I'll go...  That's how I approach a cat.  Yeah.  Oh, look, come here.  They don't like that.  No, because I run with my hands outstretched.  Hey, look, come here.  Come here.  See, that's how you would have handled the situation.  Yeah.  He would have went, like...  I would have went, come here.  You'd be screaming like a girl. 
[00:46:00]  You'd do your cat noise again.  This could be the...  This could be the start of Cat Noise Wednesday.  Wow.  You never know.  Okay, let me try one.  That's the real angry cat that's ready to scratch a reporter's face.  Okay, I'll do one in heat.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow. 
[00:46:30]  Meow.  And then you take your boot and you put it under their tail and their back arches.  That sounds like Salvo.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Jimmy, one more time before we're going to break.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Scary.  What an ass.  Hoping Anthony.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  I just got a wide.  I got wowed.  Awesome.  I just got wowed.  Oh, thank God for Opie and Anthony. 
[00:47:00]  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  Details on...  God forbid we mention a website.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Shock, shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock, shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock, shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock, shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show on this Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Hi.  Louie CK sitting down, joining the program today. 
[00:47:30]  In the office, we were talking about the OJ thing.  Yes.  Good old OJ.  We all got emails last night that we thought we had an exclusive.  We're so lame, Louie, when it comes to exclusives with this program.  We get these emails like, hey man, we got a copy of that OJ book that wasn't released.  And these emails are written in such a way that we're thinking, oh my God, we finally  could scoop the world.  Because it said, not confirmed if it's the actual book, but it looks like it. 
[00:48:00]  It looks like something.  Oh, wow.  We're getting an exclusive.  It was emailed to me in a PDF document.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's like, oh, okay, let me open this up and check it out.  And we're thinking that there's a hardcore fan deep within the publishing community that  said, ah, what the hell?  I'll give you guys this little radio nugget.  And so we got a little excited.  We're thinking, okay, we'll be the guys that break the whole OJ thing.  Read some excerpts today.  And we open up the paper.  It's like on page three.  It's all over the place. 
[00:48:30]  It's the headline of every news channel.  Yeah, everyone's got it.  We're not breaking news here.  We just want to have a scoop one time in our lousy careers.  It's like trying to get the scoop on 9-11.  Right.  Yeah, we just...  Guess what happened?  Oh, now it's everywhere.  Everyone knows about it.  We don't get the scoop on anything.  But Anthony ended up reading a lot of it.  Yeah.  Right?  Because I thought it was like...  I thought that was all there was going to be was my little copy on the computer screen.  Right.  So I'm sitting there.  My eyes are bleeding trying to read something off the computer. 
[00:49:00]  If you're just checking out videos or reading some email on a computer, that's one thing.  The whole thing with reading long form stuff on a computer screen is painful.  They don't have that figured out yet.  My head was pounding by the time I was done.  Make the font bigger.  Huh?  Make the font bigger.  Shut up.  Why not?  You can't.  Shut up.  You can't.  It doesn't help that much.  Yeah, it doesn't help.  I don't know what it is, but...  It's just looking at a monitor.  It's friggin' radiation.  Now you know how to murder your wife and the guy who's returning his sunglasses to her. 
[00:49:30]  Yes, exactly.  Because, well, as OJ said, this isn't what happened.  But if I would have done it, I would have done it this way exactly with every minute detail.  You know what bothers me about America is why can't this book be released?  I don't get why we have...  Outrage.  All right, outrage.  I don't get all of a sudden we have to have morals in the publishing community and all that.  Yeah, as if we didn't have a ball with OJ when it happened.  I mean, it was a national obsession.  Number one. 
[00:50:00]  Now we're like, hey, let's let the rest in peace.  It spawned a new network there, Court TV, with nothing before the OJ trial.  And the newspapers every day, it was huge in the news.  The verdict, it was the most watched thing since, like, the last episode of MASH.  It's just huge.  I understand making sure he doesn't get paid for and all that, but why not get the book out there?  Sure.  I mean, we all followed the trial for the two years that it was on.  If he sat down and wrote that, it should be out there.  Yeah.  Well, it is now.  When I was working at the Chris Rock show, I was writing there, and it was, I guess, about 
[00:50:30]  a year after that whole mess.  And Chris had this idea to do the first interview with OJ, and the idea was going to be this  exclusive, okay, now we can ask you, finally, who do you think should have won the MVP for  the NFL?  It's not going to be all football questions framed as if this was the big, and OJ was  dying to do it, of course.  I'm sure.  Why did it happen?  Because we didn't, I guess we didn't want to be the ones to let him back into having fun. 
[00:51:00]  Society.  Like, we didn't want to be the ones to let him in on a joke.  The scarlet murder letter on him, you don't want to be the one that kind of gives him  any credibility.  Well, Anthony read a lot, and what you were saying in the office was pretty interesting.  Oh, well, I skipped through all the crap at the beginning, which is just his relationship.  First, it's like, it just starts with, you know, like a little history on OJ, who cares?  And then there's, you know, the history of him and Nicole.  Everyone knows they had their beefs back and forth.  But it's all, it's all, so is he saying, had I won the Heisman? 
[00:51:30]  Well, no, it's not so, it's not all hypothetical.  Like, it's all fact.  And then, you know, just the part where he stabs them multiple times is hypothetical.  Because then everything after that is what happened.  He couldn't make it what happened.  He picks up with now here.  Yeah, he couldn't make it more clear that he's about to tell you the truth.  Because he starts by giving you his whole life.  It's his history.  And then I played for USC. 
[00:52:00]  He did.  He told about his relationship with, he talked about his relationship with him and his father.  Like that whole thing, his upbringing.  And then it gets to the evening in question, I think was the chapter.  But that really is funny, you know.  It's like, look, I know people are going to think that I'm just making this up to have a little,  little fun or whatever.  I keep my name out there.  No, I'm going to give my whole life history.  Where I was born, where I was raised, where I went to high school.  An entire biography. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  One chapter that has to have just changed language.  One thing that's, you know, just if I did do it, this is how I would have done it.  Right, after all the facts that he just gave.  And it doesn't even work.  I'm not saying that my father and I were a little distant.  Right, right.  But had we been, here's how it would have manifested itself.  He says, if I would have played for Buffalo, I would have, it would have been like this.  Where he uses a fake team name like they used to do in the 70s, like the Dallas Colts.  Yeah, you know, right.  The Buffalo Williams he played for. 
[00:53:00]  The Denver Balloons.  It's really too bad that this book isn't going to see the light of day.  Well, now it's going to see the light of day.  Everyone will see it.  Is this the whole book that is now out there, Ant?  Ah, yeah.  This is the whole book?  Yep.  Yep.  All right, so now you can read it for free.  Yeah.  That's actually better, though.  This is actually a very small book.  So he's not making it.  The book's two pages?  This is just one page of the, uh, he's not making a profit from it this way.  But what's the problem?  I don't know why they're going to publish it.  Mind Conf is published.  They make memoirs. 
[00:53:30]  Problem?  No.  That's, yeah.  See, this is about a black guy killing a white woman.  Right.  Oh, way to put it in perspective, Lou.  Well, maybe if OJ had a funny little mustache, people would give him a little more, uh, solely  way.  But this is all, Nicole came, Nicole came at me swinging.  Yeah.  This is not put in any, it doesn't say, had she come at me swinging?  No, no, no.  It's not put in the way.  So he just puts a disclaimer at the beginning of the thing and says, I made it up. 
[00:54:00]  Look, I'm going to do this, uh, oh my God.  He goes, Nicole came at me swinging.  Get the f*** out of here, she said.  This is my house and I can do what I want.  Not in front of my kids.  You can't.  F*** you.  No.  F*** you.  I gave you everything you could ask for and you f***ed it all up.  She came at me like a banshee, all arms and legs flailing.  I ducked and she lost her balance and fell against the stoop.  She fell hard on her right side.  I could hear the back of her head hitting the ground and lay there for a moment. 
[00:54:30]  She lay there not moving.  Can I ask a quick question here?  Yes.  In the autopsies, did they mention that she had a head injury?  Yeah, it was almost off.  Well, no, we know that.  We know that, but I mean, was there bruising in the back of her head from the fall?  That would be an interesting thing to look at.  Was to see if there was a bruise.  Was that severed head damage?  Yeah.  Right.  Was it dropped before or after it was removed from her body?  Good point, good point.  It's like when you said you're turning an iPod for a warranty.  Was there water damage?  They were probably arguing and he probably punched her in the face. 
[00:55:00]  She didn't flail and trip.  He probably punched her in the face.  Well, here's the worst part is he's getting his side of the argument in here.  Yeah, yeah.  Look, folks, the real message of this is, hey, I gave her everything she wanted.  If anyone doesn't see this bitch deserved it, that's pretty much what he's saying.  He's getting his side out.  He's trying to spite us.  Well, without actually reading verbatim, because he talks a lot, because at this point...  Who's Charlie?  Exactly.  Exactly.  He had the North Vietnamese with him. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, OJ, you get out of here.  The police are calling OJ.  I said we read this.  Let's go mother again.  Because people haven't...  They're not going to search this out.  Yeah, let me give you the basic, like, outline, though, because with some of these things  taken out of context, you might not understand what they are.  OJ goes over at Nicole's house to see his kids earlier in the day.  They go to a recital. 
[00:56:00]  They all come back.  You remember this.  This was all fact.  They come back.  Now, this guy, Charlie, there's some guy that shows up in this book.  His name is Charlie.  He's apparently some acquaintance of OJ's that OJ met at some dinner party.  Al Cowlings?  I got my theories on who Charlie is.  Oh, so he's making up a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the other guy that saw this whole thing.  So he's basically admitting there was another guy there.  He's saying there was another guy there, but I'm not sure of that either. 
[00:56:30]  There's a couple of options here.  Or it might be two people in his head?  Yeah.  I'm thinking Charlie could be good OJ.  Charlie is the side.  OJ, at some point in this action, had a mental break.  Right.  Now, he goes to the house.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Charlie, Charlie, and I'm doing the parentheses, the quotation marks.  Parentheses.  Parentheses.  Quotation mark.  Yeah.  Charlie went up to OJ and told him, OJ, I got some bad news.  OJ said, what?  He said, Nicole has been out doing drugs with her friends, getting into some kinky scenes 
[00:57:00]  and everything like that.  And OJ goes, why the F are you telling me this?  He goes, look, I just, I know about it.  I figured I'd tell you.  So he goes, he, like, thanked Charlie and goes, I want to go over there right now and  see what that bitch is doing.  So him and Charlie go over to Nicole's house and OJ, at some point, wants to see what she's  doing.  So he puts his little wool cap on and gloves and walks out with a big knife that he had 
[00:57:30]  underneath his seat.  And at this point, Charlie says to him, OJ, give me that knife.  You're not going in there with that knife.  This is what leads me to believe this is where OJ starts breaking into two people.  This was him in his car by himself.  Right.  Looking at the knife.  Thinking like.  And the little Chinese man inside of him said, oh, I don't know, bring a knife, OJ.  That will never make the air, by the way.  No.  We are not allowed.  Oh, my goodness.  To make any voices.  I'm sorry.  Words hurt, Louis.  I know.  Words hurt.  I didn't know.  It's not your fault.  Shame on you, Louis CK. 
[00:58:00]  Believe me.  There was nobody that.  Okay.  When the mics are off, let's go to town on that.  Sorry, guys.  It's not your fault.  So, no, believe me, it's not.  So, OJ goes and he gives the knife to Charlie.  Now, this, to me, is the sane OJ now has possession of the knife and he's not going to do anything  with it because it's Charlie.  Well, OJ starts talking to Nicole or talking to Goldman who pulls up with the sunglasses and saying, who the F are you? 
[00:58:30]  What are you doing here?  And giving him a lot of crap.  And then Nicole comes out because she hears the noise and when he sees Nicole all dressed up, there's candles burning in her place.  He assumes something's going on and that's why Ron Goldman's coming over.  He starts thinking back to the whole day, he says, like going to the recital, this, that, the other thing.  He, like, flashes back throughout the day. 
[00:59:00]  And then when he comes up to the point he was at during that day, which is standing there, he's got the knife in his hand and he's covered in blood and Ron Goldman is dead and Nicole is laying on the ground dead.  And Charlie's going, OJ, we got to get the F out of here.  Yeah.  Charlie, his acquaintance, he met at a dinner party who is now a murder accomplice.  Yeah.  You know what I'm wondering is if Nicole or Ron, do they say anything to Charlie in the story? 
[00:59:30]  Do they react to him?  No.  Charlie Durden was not spoken to.  So he's invisible.  He's invisible.  You're right.  Invisible friend, Charlie.  So the only thing I have about it that it's not this, like OJ suffered this break at that point.  I think that's exactly what happened.  That's why he was so able to distance himself from the actual murder and actually convince himself that he didn't do it because there was this Charlie character who is the rational OJ and then OJ who was the irrational murdering OJ. 
[01:00:00]  And for that moment he turned into the other guy where Charlie was trying to stop him from doing this.  So OJ strips down to his underwear and socks and takes his clothing, rolls it up, rolls the knife up in it.  They drive the Bronco, him and Charlie, back to Rockingham.  Then they take, he takes the bundled up bloody clothing and the weapon, gives it to Charlie and says, take this and get rid of it. 
[01:00:30]  I want this gone forever.  And no one knows who this Charlie is or where this stuff ever ended up.  I didn't want to, I didn't want to make up stuff like this is all made up.  But I didn't want to make up where the weapon ended up.  I didn't want to like make it up because the police might start digging there and find a weapon.  So he gives it to Charlie and Charlie, then he gives instructions to Charlie.  He goes, look, the limo pulled up when they pulled up to Rockingham, they saw the limo pulling in.  And OJ goes, oh crap, the limo's here. 
[01:01:00]  We got to pull around the side.  He goes, I'm going to sneak in.  You take this stuff, get rid of it.  And later on, when the limo pulls out, you pull the Bronco into the driveway, hit the gate and run out before the gate shuts.  And then I'll just say it was parked there the whole night.  Oh my God.  So that's what he did.  And you think the blood spot might have been from Charlie, quote unquote, hitting the, uh.  From, from, it could have been Charlie.  It could have been this.  Well, apparently though, uh, uh, Charlie left it out on the street because it was parked slightly askew. 
[01:01:30]  If you remember the Bronco wasn't parked right.  And then the cops, when they questioned OJ about it, they said, well, it looked like you were in a rush.  And they asked him all the questioning.  Were you in a rush packing up?  He goes, well, you know, I kind of, you know, I want to pack all my stuff.  But he didn't say it was in a rush until he talked about the carving sideways.  And then OJ was in a big rush.  So, so, uh, the limo was, was parked there.  He told Charlie to get rid of everything.  Uh, he went around the side by Cato's room, hit the air conditioner.  He said, when, when I was running into the house, I banged into the air conditioner, almost fell down. 
[01:02:00]  Uh, he went inside.  The limo guy was calling, but he assumed, uh, when he turned on his bedroom light that the limo guy would see that and assume he was in the shower.  So he didn't answer the phone, making it seem like he had been there longer than he was.  He knew the limo guy would call again.  He called when he got out of the shower.  Uh, OJ said he'd be down in a few minutes.  Went down, took the limo to, um, Chicago.  Uh, and, uh, they called him from Chicago and, uh, told him his wife was murdered, dead.  And that's when he threw the glass and cut his finger. 
[01:02:30]  But now they can't, they can't, he couldn't remember if he had cut his finger beforehand and gotten blood because now the cops are questioning him saying, OJ, we got a problem here.  And OJ goes, uh-huh.  And, uh, they said, we found blood in your Bronco.  He goes, well, I may have cut myself on a hanger as I was packing or, you know, I golf a lot.  He goes, I might have cut myself and opened it up while I was running around, uh, but, but I think I did it that night.  Like he, his story, if you read, I, I, another good part is not only the murder part with Charlie, but the questioning, because it's the actual questioning that was done by the two cops, uh, and OJ. 
[01:03:00]  It's the actual questioning.  Now, if it would have happened like this, it would have, oh, it did.  Yes.  This is the real questioning.  This part is what happened.  And you find, you find the inconsistencies.  But then he doesn't know, that's the crazy part is when he's being asked about it.  It's like such a mind-boggling layers of reality because then he's going in the past to him questioning, being questioned about something that he's saying he made up. 
[01:03:30]  He didn't do, but as he's being questioned, so did he know that he was referring to the later story he was going to have made up and he had this all made up beforehand or something?  Because as like Van Adder is questioning him, he's saying to himself, and it's in this book, he said, during that questioning, I'm saying to myself, I just have to make them believe this.  That I'm 100%, he goes, I told them, uh, uh, when I, when I went into court, I said, I'm 100% innocent, your honor. 
[01:04:00]  He goes, I just had to make them believe that.  But there's this scene between, this scene that he's created that doesn't exist supposedly in his mind, that he's dropped in between two realities.  Yeah.  So those two realities are past, but that thing is present because he just made it up.  Because he made it up, but it makes no sense that he had made this up.  It's a mess.  See, Charlie is the other guy.  Yeah, find Charlie.  Or Charlie could be Al, like, we saw him. 
[01:04:30]  Al Cowling.  I think it could be Al Cowlings, maybe it was Charlie.  He went there with the purpose of killing these, at least his wife.  It's weird, by the way, they never even convicted him of just a high-speed chase, you know.  Nothing.  Not even like a ticket.  With a gun.  Yeah.  Well, let's, uh, let's read this before the break.  So, so then this is the actual murder?  Yeah.  In OJ's words?  Yeah.  If it happened?  If it happened, but it didn't.  She came at me like a banshee, arms and legs flailing.  I could hear the back of her head, yeah, hit the ground when he pushed her over. 
[01:05:00]  She lay there a moment, not moving.  Jesus Christ, OJ, let's get the **** out of here, Charlie said.  His voice cracking.  I looked over at Goldman, and I was fuming.  I guess he thought I was going to hit him because he got into his little karate stance.  God, he's making fun of a guy.  I know.  He killed.  Yeah, exactly.  What the **** is that, I said?  You think you could take me with your karate ****?  He started circling me, bobbing and weaving, and if I hadn't been so **** angry, I would have laughed in his face.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:30]  This is OJ talking about Ron Goldman, the dead guy.  Yeah, but that's exactly what happened.  Ron Goldman probably didn't bring her.  I always thought Ron Goldman was banging her.  Probably.  I think a lot of people thought that, and he walked over, and they would just, you know, come on.  OJ, come on.  It was Charlie again, pleading.  Nicole moaned, regaining consciousness.  She stirred on the ground and opened her eyes and looked at me, but it didn't seem like anything was registering.  Charlie walked over and planted himself in front of me, blocking my view.  We are **** done here, man. 
[01:06:00]  Let's go.  See, Charlie's constantly trying to get him out of here.  Blocking my view.  I noticed the knife in Charlie's hand, and in one deft move, I remember my right glove.  I removed my right glove and snatched it up.  We're not going anywhere, I said, turning to face Goldman.  Goldman was still circling me, bobbing and weaving, but I didn't feel like laughing anymore.  You think you're tough, MF, I said.  I could hear Charlie just behind me saying something, urging me to get the **** out of there. 
[01:06:30]  And at one point, he even reached for me and tried to drag me away, but I shook him off hard and moved toward Goldman.  Okay, MF, I said.  Show me how tough you are.  Then something went horribly wrong, and I know what happened, but I can't tell you exactly how.  Even though none of this actually happened.  Right.  If I did it, I still wouldn't remember how I did it.  No.  My memory would probably be foggy, even though it's all finished.  It would be all foggy.  You know what this is? 
[01:07:00]  He's not brave enough because he doesn't know the law.  Yes.  Yeah.  So he's like.  Somebody could break precedence.  Right.  He's thinking, well.  If a dude writes a book, you get to convince him.  Like there's a little known law or something, so he's like.  It's not double jeopardy if you write it.  Yeah.  He's got to stop right there because he's not sure of the law.  Yeah.  I don't know how.  I was still standing in Nicole's courtyard, of course, but for a few moments, I couldn't remember how I'd gotten there.  When I'd arrived or even why I was there, then it came back to me very slowly. 
[01:07:30]  The recital with little Sydney up on stage dancing her little heart out, Nicole with her little heart out on the sidewalk, chipping balls in my neighbor's yard, Paula angry, not answering her phone, Charlie stopping by my house to tell me some more ugly crap about Nicole's behavior.  Then what the short, quick drive from Rockingham to the Bundy condo.  And now now I was standing in Nicole's courtyard in the dark, listening to the loud, rhythmic, accelerating beat of my own heart. 
[01:08:00]  I put my left hand on to my heart and felt my shirt was strangely wet.  I looked down at myself for several moments.  I couldn't get my mind around what I was seeing.  The whole front of me was covered in blood, but I didn't.  It didn't compute.  Is this really blood?  I wondered.  And whose blood is it?  Is it mine?  Am I hurt?  Wow.  I was more confused than ever.  What the hell was happening here?  Then I remembered that Goldman guy coming through the back gate with Judith's glasses. 
[01:08:30]  And I remember hollering at him and remember how the shouts had brought Nicole to the door.  Nicole, Jesus.  I looked down and saw her on the ground in front of me, curled up in the fetal position at the base of the stairs, not moving.  Goldman was a few feet away, slumped against the bars of the fence.  He wasn't moving either.  Both he and Nicole were lying in giant pools of blood.  I had never seen so much blood in my life.  You know, if it happened, if I had seen blood, I had never seen so much.  You think he blacked out?  In my real life, I never saw as much blood as I saw in this thing that never happened. 
[01:09:00]  That never happened.  You think he went into like this blood rage?  He just like grabbed a knife and just started hacking?  That's two things.  He either blacked out and really doesn't remember how he, quote, killed them.  Yeah.  Or he doesn't want to, you know, officially tell us that part.  Right.  He's scared of the law.  Because he would have, I think he blacked out because wouldn't he have made up something that exonerates him in a weird way?  Well, he would have made up facts that went against the case.  He kept running into my knife.  Yeah, good point.  That is good point.  I thought you'd exonerate yourself. 
[01:09:30]  Charlie did it.  But he would have made up facts that did.  It's interesting how Charlie like disappears from time to time.  Yeah, yeah.  Charlie just like goes away.  Comes and goes.  Like the whole time he was butchering these people, Charlie wasn't doing anything?  We got to take a break, but I want to get through this before the break.  Okay, part two of what would have happened.  No, no, no.  Just finish up.  Finish this up.  Yeah.  What the what the happened here?  Who had done this and why?  And where the was I when this went down? 
[01:10:00]  I was like part of my life was missing.  There was like some weird gap in my existence.  But how could that be?  I was standing right there.  That was me.  Right.  I looked down again at myself and the blood so close.  I noticed I had a knife in my hand.  The knife was covered with blood as were my hands, wrist and half of my right forearm.  That didn't compute either.  I wondered how all that blood had gotten all over the knife and again asked myself whose blood it might be when suddenly it all made perfect sense.  This was just a bad dream, a very bad dream.  At any moment now, I would wake up at my home in my own bed and start going about my day. 
[01:10:30]  Then I heard a sound from behind me and turned startled.  Charlie was standing in the shadows a few feet away, his mouth hanging open, his breathing short and ragged.  He was looking beyond me at the bodies.  Charlie, I called out.  He didn't answer.  Charlie, still nothing.  I went over and stood in front of him and asked him the same question I'd asked myself.  Charlie, what the f*** happened here?  He looked up and met my eyes, but for several moments it was as if he didn't really see me. 
[01:11:00]  Are you listening to me, I said.  I asked, what happened?  Charlie shook his head from side to side, his mouth still hanging open, his breath still short and ragged.  And in a voice that was no more than a frightened whisper, he said, Jesus Christ, O.J., what have you done?  Me?  What the hell was he talking about?  I hadn't done anything.  I jumped at the sound behind me, a high-pitched, almost human wail.  It was Cato the dog circling Nicole's body, his big paws leaving Prince in the wet blood.  He lifted his snout and let out another wail that sent chills up and down my spine. 
[01:11:30]  Let's get the f*** out of here, I said.  I hurried toward the rear gate and moved through it with Charlie close behind, but I stopped myself before I crossed into the alley.  Charlie bumped into me and jumped back startled.  What?  He said.  I didn't answer.  I was thinking about the shape I was in.  I was thinking of the blood all over my shirt.  My pants were sticking to my skin.  Even my shoes were covered in blood.  Here's the thing.  O.J.  Yeah, I know.  It's a misprint.  O.J. either.  It wasn't edited.  Yeah, he couldn't get an editor to go, O.J., when you murdered your wife, you should have written blood. 
[01:12:00]  Blood, not hood.  Here's the thing.  O.J. is either a murderer or an amazingly good writer.  Great writer.  If you ever read confessions of murders that are beautifully written, there's no fiction  that is better written than them.  Just like this.  So either he is an incredibly...  He's like Charles Dickens or a murderer.  I'm O.J. Spillane.  He's either Mickey Spillane or a disgusting murderer.  Yeah, I point to disgusting murderer. 
[01:12:30]  I think I'm pretty sure it's that one.  Where's the next novel, O.J.?  Write a next novel about something that didn't happen.  Once upon a time.  Like, it's all just drivel.  It's crazy.  Is it more?  It's crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Read this all day.  Why don't we take a break?  We got Louis C.K. in the house today.  And it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Lots going on.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Anthony and I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says...  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Great.  Wow. 
[01:13:00]  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female enemies.  Wow.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Discussing this O.J. thing through the commercials.  Yeah.  Well, me and Louis C.K. have been hashing it over.  And we're going out on a limb and saying, O.J. did it. 
[01:13:30]  After reading all this, yeah.  He did it.  It's riveting.  It really is.  We are just laughing at the fact that this O.J. is not this good.  He's not an amazing writer.  He's not.  This is material from a great author.  Yes.  Two people tell stories beautifully.  Some authors with incredible imaginations and people that really did stuff.  Really did stuff.  And just simply tell you what happened. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  O.J. has never, as far as I'm concerned, I don't know.  He's never written a book, has he?  He's never written fiction.  No.  You know what?  Louis C.K. makes a really good point because it's a little known fact that we're starting  to, you know, write about our careers and stuff.  And it comes so easy.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  We got 40 to 50 pages done of just stories.  We're not really sure where we're going yet.  Oh, I could rattle out, like, things that have happened in my life.  Yeah.  Like a typewriter.  I got...  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Like, no problem.  Even when you tell stories about your dad and your home life, it's incredibly interesting  because you're just telling what really happened because you were there and it happened.  I was there.  It happened.  But if you had to write a story about a family or about two guys on a radio, you know...  I couldn't do it.  No.  It would just be like, and then they got another show.  Yeah.  That was nice.  But that's the point I'm trying to make because I have attempted to do other writings.  It's like, oh, this is garbage.  And you read it.  It's like, this is awful.  He jumped into the car and turned the ignition key.  Yeah, right.  This sounds stupid.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  But if you murdered somebody, that kind of memory is so... 
[01:15:00]  Etch.  Just so...  Well...  That the memory of getting in the car and what you felt as you started...  Yeah, it's compelling.  Really compelling.  It's written in a way that is very compelling because it's coming directly from the mind  of the guy that killed these two people.  Without a doubt.  Yeah, like, we wrote about the voyeur bus.  It came really easy to us.  Really easy.  Yeah.  Because it happened.  You didn't have to make up stuff. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  And try to, like, over-explain and...  He's writing things...  The details.  He's writing things you wouldn't think are interesting.  Yes.  And, like, you wouldn't think, like, me mumbling, oh, my God, why did you do that?  Like, you wouldn't think to write that as an interesting fact.  Well, that's exactly it, is that if you were writing about a murder that you didn't commit,  that you would just say, I cut their throats and threw the knife away and ran off.  Right.  The part, the moment, if you really cut somebody's throats, the moment you'd never forget, and  that would feel like 10 pages long in your head... 
[01:16:00]  Right.  ...is just standing there, looking at yourself with blood all over your body...  When it's over.  ...and knowing that, not understanding why or how you did it and feeling like this moment  is the moment I'm going to live for...  He's still living that moment.  Obviously, he's writing it, so...  I think that moment, that's probably why you don't get this description of the murder itself.  We were saying during the commercial break, if you want the description of the murder,  because you're getting this blacked out OJ, you're like, one minute he's yelling, the 
[01:16:30]  next minute he's standing there covered in blood.  If you want what happened in between, go to the trial transcripts, and forensics will tell  you exactly how both of those people were killed, how the knife moved, how they were standing.  They know all of that.  That's what everybody already knows.  So they know that.  But what you don't know is what it felt like.  And if I could equate it to something, it might seem a little weird, and like we would  do, but sex itself. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, sure.  When you and I and Jimmy have sex?  Yes, all the time.  It's great.  Take some kind of kinky sex act you do, or something, you're a little drunk and you decide  to shave stuff off, or you do something that's really a lot of fun, sexually exciting, and  then once you're done, once the moment of truth is done, and you look around at the bed,  and there's toys on it, and like clippings, hair clippings, and like just all kinds of  crap.  And then you go like, oh God, what a weirdo. 
[01:17:30]  And the clean-off part is all degrading.  Like that's the part that sticks out in your head.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta wipe things off and put them away.  Half-eaten.  And that's the part that's like, ugh.  I'm kind of Haagen-Dazs sitting in the corner.  Oh God, what did I do?  You got to do.  Right.  Why speculate?  Let's just stop the speculation.  Yeah.  When you're rinsing your mouth 30 times with hydrogen peroxide.  Say it. 
[01:18:00]  Why?  Dominatrix puts on her clothes.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.  Great idea at the time.  He was caught up in that rage, that sexual moment.  And then the aftermath is when you look around and go, oh my God, what happened?  And that's the part that's like.  No, that's what like me and Nick DiPaolo were talking about sex on the road when you're  on the road doing stand-up and when you meet somebody and have sex with them.  The moment that we describe, the juicy moment that is the best part, is that metallic sound 
[01:18:30]  of the hotel room door clicking closed when she leaves.  It's like the kink.  And you're like, yes!  Room service, TV, shower.  Mission accomplished.  Yes, get her out!  That's the moment you don't like, ooh, then she did this, that.  You don't know that.  You don't care about what she did to your genitalia.  The getaway.  The escape.  Here's the deal with the OJ book, too.  I mean, if he's going to write like this, if I did it type of thing.  Yeah.  And he didn't really do it.  He would describe the murder in detail because that would have been the juicy stuff. 
[01:19:00]  Yes.  To get to that point and then all of a sudden I'm covered with blood.  You wouldn't do that if you were trying to hook people into reading your book.  Exactly.  You would actually come up with everything.  So it leads me to believe, once again, that he either blacked out or he was scared of  the law.  Maybe.  I don't think...  I wasn't sure if this could, you know, send him down a road.  I think it's a little of both.  I don't think he's scared of the law.  So then he had to have blacked out.  I think he's scared.  He knows he did it, but he blacked out.  He's scared to absolutely say, I did this. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  He's scared of that because, believe it or not, there's still public that accept him.  Right.  That, you know, don't think he did it.  That let him into their restaurants and treat him like the star that he was beforehand.  And he loves that lifestyle.  I don't know who they are.  They write the Jews.  That's right.  Those apologetic Jews.  That's right.  But they don't...  Apologists.  He doesn't want to come out and say it.  Also, I think to get descriptive about exactly what he did, if it doesn't coincide with the 
[01:20:00]  actual forensics, it takes away the credibility of the rest of his story, which seems odd.  You would think you would want to not have the credibility that I killed these people,  but...  Sorry, go ahead.  Because I have a question.  Yeah, it just seems like he would want to keep everything consistent with the trial and  everything that happened.  But you're the one that read a lot of this last night.  Do you think he blacked out during the murder?  No.  I don't think he blacked out.  I think...  You just think he's holding back like...  I think he's one of those people that can get into that rage where, as you're doing 
[01:20:30]  it, you don't care.  And then the second you're done, you go, oh, Christ.  That's how you do it.  Like normal people, you punch a wall when you're mad.  You don't want to punch a frigging brick wall.  It's going to hurt your hand, dummy.  But you do it anyway.  And then afterwards, you go, why the hell did I do that?  But that's what...  That's...  I think he remembers what happened.  That times a billion.  I think he remembers what happened.  I don't know about it.  I think he remembers...  I think he wants people to know what this felt like so they can sympathize. 
[01:21:00]  So they can put themselves in it and go, wow, you know...  Without the barbaric part where you'd hit him again?  He's just not...  He didn't go into Tasmanian devil spinning and just cutting people apart.  There was like slitting of throats.  He says deftly.  He actually brags about how deft he was.  I took off the glove and grabbed the knife.  And then I don't know what happened.  And then I don't know what happened.  I thought that...  I nailed that maneuver.  That karate thing is interesting. 
[01:21:30]  That's really interesting.  That to me is the interesting part of it is the karate thing.  That pissed him off.  Like, I'll bet you that stupid Goldman thought he could kick OJ.  He's going to imagine that in your head.  How do you make up a whole story that didn't happen?  And just for the heck of it, I'm going to create this karate guy.  This guy kicked karate in and annoyed me.  And it annoyed me because how dare you think your karate can beat the OJ.  But you could see if that was real.  Was he taking karate lessons?  He probably was.  If OJ put it in the book...  Did he punch Nicole in the face? 
[01:22:00]  He probably punched Nicole in the face.  And then the guy jumped into a karate stance and he's just like,  You've got to go.  He probably punched her.  He probably didn't start stabbing her.  If you think somebody was having sex with your wife and you punch your wife,  I don't know, stop me when you stop relating to it.  I'm married.  I know.  And then a guy does a karate stance.  He's like, Oh, get out.  You're going to go, Hey, excuse me.  You're gone.  You're not going to be banging her this evening.  I'm going to be killing you. 
[01:22:30]  That's pretty much what OJ said.  Exactly.  Because when he showed up, apparently there were candles lit inside her condo.  And she was wearing this little red number, I guess, or that white thing,  whatever she was wearing.  It was red afterwards.  But that's for sure.  Did he pay for that condo?  He paid for everything.  And some young pretty boy who's going to F your hot wife in your place where your kids are.  He's certainly not right, but definitely men could react that way.  That's what happened.  It was just, well, you know what it was also, it was months of stories that he had heard about her driving around in the cars that he bought with these guys and stuff. 
[01:23:00]  So he was enraged.  Regardless, some people can just blow that off and go, whatever.  He's not, that's what makes this definitely a confession is that if he hadn't done it, it would have been how I did it technically.  Just, hey, let's have some fun.  Yeah, here's a how-to.  But what he's saying is this is why.  Murder for dummies by OJ with a yellow cover.  This is why, and this is how it felt. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Those are things you can't make up.  How does OJ so know how someone feels standing there after they've butchered two people in pools of blood and know that feeling of maybe that coming back to reality?  Like you're in this fog of just this bloodlust thing going on, and then you come back from it?  How does he know that happens?  And why would you speculate about that? 
[01:24:00]  And why is that the thing you'd write about?  Right.  Why would you speculate about that?  A-ha, I stabbed her.  Yeah.  If you had been tried falsely of killing someone you loved, and all of a sudden you're acquitted and the whole country thinks you're still...  Why would you engage in this?  Exactly.  Why would you take realities in your life and meshing those into a reason to kill somebody?  Right.  That's the thing that is psychotic and would be, again, genius writing if it wasn't true.  Genius.  It's like, let's take a guy who's innocent of murder and take real things in his life and turn them into reasons to kill somebody he didn't kill. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  And really, like, make it palatably real that you killed him and how it felt.  Yeah.  And then ease back into the reality.  Into the reality.  Of this innocent man trying to come up with things with fakes.  I was in Chicago.  I cut my finger on a shot glass that I threw when I heard she was murdered by me.  I was feeling weird about it being interrogated even though none of it...  Oh, God.  Right. 
[01:25:00]  What is this book?  It's so odd.  How did he stop this book?  I want to read it.  That's what it made me, they wouldn't allow this book to be published.  The entire book's available now.  Not only that, people got fired because of this book.  Judith Regan?  Yeah, Judith got fired, right?  Well, this is odd because now people are questioning, were there two people at the scene, O.J.  and this Charlie guy, or was Charlie somebody else?  But there wasn't any physical evidence of any other people at that location.  But why not this?  Charlie was just standing there on the sidewalk.  All right.  How about this line? 
[01:25:30]  How about this line?  As they were walking away.  When we last left you, O.J. had just murdered two people.  He was walking down the sidewalk, escaping the scene with his friend Charlie.  Stop.  Stop.  I turned and looked behind me.  Here it is.  Behind me.  Beyond Charlie.  And saw a track of bloody telltale prints.  Now, remember, his shoes had left just a trail of blood.  We're talking pools of blood.  If you've seen these murder scene pictures, they are gruesome.  Did the electric slide for your pancreas? 
[01:26:00]  Yes, exactly.  Just horrific scenes of carnage.  And now he turned to look behind him and looked beyond Charlie, who's walking behind him.  And Charlie didn't muss up any of the blood prints that O.J. was walking.  I mean, come on.  That can be explained.  If you're Charlie and you didn't go over there to murder people and you see your friend losing his mind,  killing these people, butchering them to death, and now you're leaving with O.J.,  you're going to be careful where you're walking.  You're kidding me?  It's dark.  There's blood everywhere. 
[01:26:30]  O.J.'s leaving trails of it.  So you're thinking that he should have stepped in one of O.J.'s prints on the way out?  Absolutely.  No way.  There would be some evidence that that guy was at a scene.  You cannot be at that scene without something on you.  Well, also, didn't he say he just met him at a party or something?  Yeah, it was like a casual acquaintance.  He created a party who will die with that secret, who will dump clothes, who held evidence.  Held the clothes.  I was saying.  And wouldn't just go right to the police.  Exactly.  I'm afraid of O.J.  That is a good thing.  I barely know the guy.  Charlie, take this and just get rid of it. 
[01:27:00]  Okay, I'm going to deposit it at the police department, O.J.  And I'm going to watch this happen in the whole country for the next year.  I would just be yes-ing O.J. to death.  Yeah.  And then the second I left, find a cop and go, look, O.J. just murdered these two people.  Here's the evidence you'll need.  I had nothing to do with it.  I told him about Nicole, and he went wild.  I'm a witness to it.  I'm willing to testify.  Obviously, Charlie's protecting possibly Al Cowling.  So it's like throw everyone off the trail.  Like, no, it's a guy that I met at a dinner party, or it's the other person that lives inside my head. 
[01:27:30]  But I can see that Charlie can leave the scene without leaving any evidence.  I don't think Charlie would think of it.  Because he was fine.  You didn't do anything wrong.  You just watched a guy kill his wife.  You're walking innocently like you're in shock that a guy â€“ you're not thinking of evidence protection because you didn't commit a crime.  But Charlie wasn't at the epicenter of the murder scene.  How do you â€“ what about this?  He took the knife from Charlie to kill these people.  What's Charlie doing?  I just don't know how Charlie â€“  Hey, man, let's say Aunt Nye are in this situation. 
[01:28:00]  And Aunt Nye grabs a knife from me because he wants to go do some horrific thing.  I'm backing up.  I'm not moving forward closer to the action.  People have to exit the same way.  Well, how about the first blast he takes into someone's chest with the knife?  You're not going to, like, go, oh, my God, what the hell happened?  Either run away or try to get O.J. off the guy.  Charlie stood there.  Two people.  And watched him butcher two people, slit their throats and everything.  And Charlie just stood there. 
[01:28:30]  Eh.  Might have been too late.  As the dinner party acquaintance.  This is where the fact that he's not â€“  That is a star-struck mother effer.  Yeah.  If he's going to stand there just to be with O.J.  All right.  This is where the fact that he's not â€“ and again, another amazing layer to the fiction.  Right.  That inside this completely true story, he has put a fake man who doesn't exist.  A fake guy.  Right.  And you can tell because if you ever write, the hard thing is called the keeping balls in  the air.  Uh-huh.  Keeping a bunch of fires lit.  Right.  The people disappear if you don't keep mentioning them.  Yeah.  And that's what happens to Charlie. 
[01:29:00]  So you have to â€“ and so Charlie keeps â€“  Charlie is the part of O.J. that didn't want to kill those people that night.  When you write fiction and when you write movies, you have to make sure people talk to  each other so they know each other exists.  Right.  Just little things that other people don't notice.  Right.  In order to make people real in a story, you have to make sure that everyone interacts  with them and that they are mentioned often enough to not be forgotten.  He doesn't do that.  No.  It's the one thing he doesn't do well in this story.  In this story.  It's completely true.  Well, hopefully on the next murder that he writes about, he'll do well.  He'll â€“  Charlie is the last bit of sanity O.J. had that night that was trying to get himself 
[01:29:30]  out of the situation.  Oh, man.  He kept telling them, leave.  O.J., leave.  Let's go.  He had the knife at one point.  When Charlie had the knife, it was safe.  How do you definitely take off a glove and take a knife from someone?  And take a knife from â€“  From someone who's trying to keep it away from you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unless they're holding it.  You need an assistant.  Right.  You could hold it.  Your knife, Mr. Simpson.  Well, let's read through this page because then we're going to move on to other things.  We're late for another break, believe it or not. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  He turned â€“  Don't move it by way too fast.  Why the name's Charlie?  Why not some really interesting name like Kensington?  I look beyond Kensington.  There was a track of Bloody Telltale Prince.  I've got to get rid of these effing clothes, I said.  Without even thinking about it, I kicked off my shoes and began to strip.  I took off my pants, shirt, dropped the knife and shoes into the center of the pile.  Right there at the murder scene.  Right.  Yeah.  At the murder scene.  He dropped the whole thing in the middle of the clothes, wrapped it up into a tight bundle. 
[01:30:30]  I left my socks on, though.  I don't know why, but I didn't see blood on them.  Little details are great that OJ, the fiction writer, comes up with.  So I had no reason to remove them.  As I stood with the bundle grasped in my left hand, I realized that I'd left my keys and wallet in the pants.  I fell to a crouch and dug for them and noticed that my hands were shaking.  Charlie stood there all the while mumbling.  That's where he cut his hands.  Yeah, could have.  Where?  The knife was in amongst his clothes and he dug in there to get his keys and wallet, maybe. 
[01:31:00]  With shaking hands and he cut his finger.  Oh my God.  Because when he slugged the...  That's why he doesn't remember.  Because he cut it in, he just cut it in there.  His hands were shaking.  Could have been.  That's how you cut your finger.  That's the only way you cut your finger and you don't remember.  He actually didn't remember.  And they found dripping blood, drops of blood at his house that came from his wounded finger.  Yes.  So it was a recent wound.  It wasn't something.  Nobody cuts their finger that is dripping blood without knowing how.  Unless you just killed two people and you're in shock. 
[01:31:30]  So he goes for...  That's what he should have said to the cops.  How am I supposed to know where I cut my...  I just killed two people, man.  I killed two people.  Oops.  So if he goes for his wallet and his keys and he cuts his hand.  Might have cut his hand there.  Interesting.  During the murder.  Charlie stood there all the while mumbling, Jesus Christ, OJ, Jesus Christ.  He just kept repeating himself like he'd lost his goddamn mind or something.  So Charlie lost his mind at that point.  Poor Charlie.  But OJ was fine.  Will you shut the F up?  I snapped.  I found my keys in my wallet and rewrapped the bundle.  Then I stood there and hurried across the dark alley.  Then I stood up and hurried across the dark alley. 
[01:32:00]  Charlie followed, still mumbling.  I got behind the wheel and Charlie climbed into the passenger seat.  Jesus Christ, OJ.  He said, Jesus Christ, will you shut the F up?  Charlie recoiled, startled, and shut up.  I started the Bronco and pulled out.  The tires squealing and raced through the curved alley toward Montana Avenue.  When I reached the end of the alley, I made a left on Montana, immediate right at the corner onto Gretna Green.  Stan Vincent was a block away.  I made a left there.  It's the OJ navigation system.  I turned on K-Rock. 
[01:32:30]  I took it all the way to Bristol.  Too much detail.  Then hung a right on Sunset and made a left there toward home.  I glanced at Charlie.  He was hunched over his elbows, on his knees, his face buried in his hands.  See, again, he doesn't describe Charlie getting in the car.  No.  He gets in the car magically.  Yeah.  He doesn't exist.  Charlie got the passenger seat.  He just said it.  Oh, Charlie was in the passenger seat.  Yeah.  Where?  Where?  Where does he say that?  After he read it.  Yeah.  Charlie climbed into the passenger seat.  Yeah.  Saying Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.  What happened back there, Charlie?  You look into that alley.  You would have seen one man going, oh, what did I do?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Right, right.  That's what you would have seen.  Charlie, you should have called Charlie Kitty Carriol.  George Glass.  Mr. Pibbles.  Let's see.  Charlie, face buried in his hands.  What happened back there, Charlie?  I said, Charlie sat up.  His cheeks were wet with tears.  He shook his head from side to side and shrugged.  I thought back to the horrific scene at the courtyard and at all the blood.  I've never seen so much blood in my life.  It didn't seem possible.  It didn't seem real.  Charlie?  He still didn't answer. 
[01:33:30]  But what the hell?  This wasn't really happening.  There's no Charlie.  That hadn't been me back there.  I'd imagine the whole thing.  I was imagining it then.  In actual fact, I was home in bed, asleep, having one of those crazy crime of passion dreams.  One of those crazy I murdered my wife dreams I always have.  But I was going to wake up any second now.  Yeah, that was it.  Only I didn't wake up.  We were still on sunset.  I passed the light on Burlingham.  I made a sharp ride onto Rockingham.  I was tearing up the winding hill toward the house. 
[01:34:00]  As I approached the gate, I saw a limo moving toward Rockingham, the Rockingham gate from Ashford.  And remembered I had a flight to catch.  I drove past my house and past the limo.  And in the side mirror, I saw the taillights flare up as it pulled to a stop in front of my gate.  The driver had probably been waiting on Ashford out of sight.  And I wondered if he'd already called the house.  I had no idea what time it was.  I looked down at the Broncos clock and saw it was 1037.  F, I'm supposed to be in that limo in eight minutes. 
[01:34:30]  Jeez.  So remembering, and then again, it's like remembering, feeling like this couldn't possibly ever happen.  It couldn't have happened.  It didn't actually happen.  The further you get from the scene, too, you would think that didn't happen.  This is the dovetailing into the reality that he's fakely created.  Yeah, this isn't.  How long was his flight?  He had a 10.45 pickup for an 11.45 flight.  He only gave himself an hour?  It was before 9-11.  He's OJ.  He runs through airports.  Yeah.  And there was a time you could get through security like that. 
[01:35:00]  No problem.  It's not like I'm a murderer or something.  Oh, just remember to jump over that guy tying his shoes.  Exactly.  Remember that?  Go, OJ, go.  We could read this all day.  There's so much more.  Maybe later on in the show we'll get back on it.  He murdered those people.  It's available online.  Yeah.  Great read.  It's a great read.  Anthony read all night.  I highly recommend the fiction writer OJ.  Looking forward to his next works.  All right.  We're going to get into some other things after the break. 
[01:35:30]  Louis C.K. in studio.  Louis, are you promoting anything there?  Shameless.  My new HBO special is coming out on DVD June 26th.  Very cool.  So please buy it.  I think a lot of our listeners will definitely buy that.  Right now, for a random caller, if you're in the New York area, we've got a pair of tickets  to the premiere of Live Free or Die Hard on June 22nd at Radio City Music Hall.  Of course, Bruce Willis is back as John McClain.  The only way to live free is to die hard in theaters June 27th.  But we've got a pair of tickets so you can go to the premiere this Friday. 
[01:36:00]  Give us a call, 877-212-5762.  Just make sure you can use the tickets because we're being heard all over the country.  All right.  More with Louis C.K. in just a bit.

Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Wow, we got bored during the commercials, huh? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, we did a little bit.  It's Opie and Anthony, Louis C.K. in studio.  And, you know, we got the pal talk thing happening.  And it kind of pissed us off.  The other day, we're reading in the paper that some station, where are they, Providence?  Where are they?  Where is 670 the score from?  Chicago?  Uh, they're out of Chicago?  Are you sure?  Anyway, it was in the paper that this radio show was going to be using pal talk.  And they're one of the first radio shows to use pal talk. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  To bring their listeners a little closer to the experience of the radio show.  Yeah.  And we're like, hello?  Hello?  Everyone knows at this point we put pal talk on the map.  Pal talk and radio shows.  That's it.  Why not admit where you got the idea from?  That's all.  That's all we're asking for.  So, we checked out their little pal talk room.  They had 10 people in there today.  So, we have decided to, what, their end?  Room raid.  Room raid.  Yeah.  We told all the people in our room, and we got hundreds of people in our room, to just 
[01:37:30]  go there and, yeah, chat with them.  Yeah.  And I'm just reading things that are coming up, most of which I cannot.  You suck, bitches.  This room sucks.  They are attacking them.  White Sox suck.  So, you can see the guy, too?  Yeah.  The guy.  There he is.  With a befuddled look on his face.  Here's the beauty of radio.  This is happening right in front of the guy's face.  He's not honest enough to at least admit that it's happening.  He's just looking down and reading up stupid box scores, making believe he doesn't see what's 
[01:38:00]  going on right now.  This is what radio's all about, right?  Right here.  Douches like this.  A lot of frunkuses coming through, calling him a gravy leg.  He's just sitting there.  A little gravy leg.  Barry Bonds didn't hit a homer last night.  Why don't you talk about what's really happening right in front of your face, you loser?  Oh, they're just attacking him.  The score equals moose seed.  A little call back from two days ago, Jimmy, huh? 
[01:38:30]  Oh, they're really ruining the room.  Someone just wrote vagina.  No comment about it.  No nothing.  Just the word.  That's perfect.  Yeah.  There you go.  Look at that.  Yeah, why don't you make believe this isn't going on.  There you go.  Calling him a kid toucher.  Jesus.  Oh, it's great.  Half the stuff we can't even read on the air, unfortunately.  You know the local media is probably monitoring that room today because he just talked about  how they're like in pal talk.  This terrific new thing that he invented.  They're going to be looking at us and seeing them just being attacked with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Look at this guy.  The text is scrolling by so fast, too.  Can't even read it.  Pounding him.  Oh, my God.  Get AIDS.  Someone spammed him with get AIDS.  It's going by so fast.  It's like the Matrix green.  Yeah, that's all you're saying.  If he looks at me real hard, he can see himself.  This sucks.  It's coming up all over and over again.  This sucks.  You suck.  Silly geese.  I can't read anything.  It's so fast.  They're attacking them. 
[01:39:30]  It's like watching somebody be pummeled by 30 people.  They're watching a mob attack.  We have completely taken over that room, and we will every day now.  This is what we do.  You were not the first station to use pal talk, you douche.  That's such a message.  Hey, what happened?  They signed off.  They signed off.  Ah, they just signed off.  Yeah, douches.  There you go.  There's real radio for you.  They signed off.  Not only are they not acknowledging what's going on, they signed off.  They don't want to be a part of this.  Oh, that is funny. 
[01:40:00]  I say that we have to find out what room they start up next, because he's probably just going  to start a different room and then say it on his awful radio show.  Fine, we'll figure it out.  We're live in Chicago right now.  We've got a bunch of people listening on WCKJ.  Find out what the next room he signs on as.  Now they're just attacking a room.  They're just attacking each other.  Yeah, they're just.  A bunch of guys yelling, Opie and Anthony.  The Cubs win!  Doing their John Sterling impressions.  Mike North, 670, the score.  Mike's accomplishments include receiving the Entertainer of the Year award by the Special 
[01:40:30]  Children's Charities.  Well, he did get the Irv Cup Synod Award, and we all understand the Irv Cup Synod Award.  What?  Wow, that's a very, it's a big guess.  He also received a Man of the Year in 1999, and a World's Greatest Dad Cup, someone handed  him.  Worst awards I've ever heard in my life.  He received a You're a Good Guy shirt from a friend once. 
[01:41:00]  The Ellis Island Medal of Honor?  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  It's just something you buy at the gift shop.  Is it at Ellis Island yet?  Yeah.  You're leaving.  He received an iPod that he bought at the store.  He won the Silver Circle Award?  What is that?  From the National Conference for Community and Justice of Chicago and Greater Illinois.  No.  That's a long name for an organization.  Wow, this is some impressive award.  Mike was honored as of 2006 as an inductee into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. 
[01:41:30]  The first radio broadcast ever to be inducted.  No, the first radio broadcaster that wanted to be in that horse crap.  Media Excellence Award from the National Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame.  But I got one of those.  How many groups are there?  I got my goal.  If you join any of these groups, you are going to then get an award five minutes later.  Because you just walked in the door and, oh God, somebody came in.  I like how he received an award from the Media Excellence Award from the National Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame. 
[01:42:00]  Yet he's not proud enough to use his real name because it's Mike North.  Where's his Italian last name?  Wait, he's back in the room.  All right, he's back in the room.  No.  You fat piece of crap.  Oh, is he?  He's back in the room?  Yeah, he is.  I'm going to lose audio for a second.  Sorry.  There you go.  Fellas.  All right, good job.  That's good.  Good job, boys and girls.  Good job.  Continue.  They're calling it 670 the boar.  I love words. 
[01:42:30]  The boar.  Just admit where you got the idea from, you loser.  Hey, we got Marge from Little Shelter on the line.  Let's get a Marge update.  Hey, Marge.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Shut up.  How are you today?  For once, let us start the conversation.  Marge.  We always monopolize Marge's conversation.  Marge, I said shut up.  Thank you.  We had a cute little.  Good morning, Marge.  Marge.  Oh, my God.  No, you can't say it.  Marge. 
[01:43:00]  Opie.  Go ahead, Marge.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Hi, Marge.  I just wanted to say that the guy that answers the phone before you get on is the sweetest,  loveliest.  Oh, yes.  Little girl.  He just kind of prepares you for the battle ahead.  Oh, does he?  He really does.  He softens you up, and he makes you think everything is...  You soften everyone up, Marge.  I've seen pictures.  And then, and then, well, you know that after I had the conversation with you, I had to go 
[01:43:30]  back to bed.  I was like worn out.  Good.  Yeah.  You should be.  Nice.  I'm going to explain to Louis C.K. what's going on with Marge from the little shelter out  there in Long Island.  First of all, Marge, we had a cute, feel-good story this morning.  Yeah, it was great.  You'd love this.  It was an animal story.  We don't have many.  It was an animal story, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the 62-year-old guy in Florida, he was doing something with his garbage, and he  saw a cat.  He saw a cat looking at him.  Aw. 
[01:44:00]  And he noticed that the cat didn't run away.  He also noticed that the cat was a bobcat.  A bobcat.  So what do you think this guy in Florida did to the bobcat?  I don't know.  You tell me.  I choked it out until it died.  All right.  Gentlemen.  He had to choke it because it attacked him, and it had rabies.  I wish that guy was on the phone right now because I would love to hear Marge's take  on the choking out of the bobcat.  Gentlemen.  Yes, Marge.  So he had to choke out the little fella to save his own life. 
[01:44:30]  You know what?  I don't care what you say.  I know you really love animals.  That's why I permit myself to be so degraded.  Talk about your personal life.  You know, I've been getting calls from people.  Wait, wait.  I've got to set up the bit.  From Ramon or Frankus.  Who's calling?  Louis C.K. has no idea why we're talking to Marge.  I think I remember this woman.  Does she have a shelter for animals?  Yes.  The animal shelter. 
[01:45:00]  She calls up with the craziest request.  The other day, Marge calls up and said she needed Viagra for the animals.  For one of the dogs.  There's a female dog that needs the Viagra because she has a heartworm problem and the  Viagra opens up the blood vessels.  I thought the worms were soft and she wanted to harden them.  We were thinking that maybe Marge is doing something with the animals and the animals are like, yeah.  So they need a little help. 
[01:45:30]  You know, first of all, before we get into this, the nitty-gritty of this situation.  Did you get your Viagra?  We have gotten 300.  Uh-oh.  Listen to me.  300 pills have been promised.  Really?  As far away as California.  But the thing that I want to tell you guys.  You know what's great about Marge?  She'll keep babbling.  That's why you have to jump in.  She pretty much admitted on our show that she needs people to sell.  I mean, to mail drugs. 
[01:46:00]  Drugs through the mail.  Illegal prescription drugs.  Illegal prescription drugs.  You can't mail this stuff without a prescription there, Marge.  No.  The authorities are coming to get you and your stupid animals.  What?  Why do I think Opie is more sympathetic?  To animals?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  You sure don't know the show.  You're going to try that.  That's interesting.  No one has tried that angle before.  Okay.  Listen.  Before I go and tell you some interesting stories, which I know you're going to just kill me for. 
[01:46:30]  Uh-huh.  Do you remember I made a suggestion yesterday?  That we go down to the little shelter and broadcast, do a live broadcast from the little shelter.  Do you know how many animals' lives would be saved because of that, Jess?  Three.  Three on the nose.  Yes.  Three goats and an iguana.  God.  You guys will have a special place in heaven if you do that.  A special place in heaven?  I'd rather roam free and have access to the whole heaven. 
[01:47:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  I don't want a special place.  Now, you guys stay in this room with the other animal lover idiots.  What happened?  I want to just float around.  There's a rope.  There's bars you can't get into.  VIP rooms that aren't VIP rooms.  There's a back room that's better.  Of course.  It's the same in heaven?  Yep.  Sweetheart.  Are there booby bars in heaven?  Yeah.  I don't know what's in heaven.  Oh, we'll save that for pot talk on Monday.  But I know that there is a special place in heaven.  Yeah, it's probably next to a litter box.  That's where you want to be in heaven.  In the bathroom near a litter box. 
[01:47:30]  You're smelling that.  Yeah.  Anthony.  Knowing me, I would do this nice gesture.  I'd go to heaven and then I'd have to spend an eternity with a room full of cats.  And I'm allergic to the damn things.  We have never gotten as much publicity as we have because of it.  Marge.  Wow.  But all for the wrong reasons.  Yes.  Marge, you don't need 300 Viagra pills for this little thing.  It's a little darling little girl that she is.  Marge, honestly, let me ask you an honest question. 
[01:48:00]  Has the shelter been hurt by the fact that you're a whore?  Okay.  I just want to tell you that there's been people that are writing and calling in.  Yes.  And some of these things are really hysterical.  Now, I cannot, as you cannot say certain things on the air.  I cannot say this word, but I can sort of tell you it starts with F and ends with N.  And this person said...  Wait, it starts with S and ends with N?  Yeah.  Fun? 
[01:48:30]  Because you bring none?  Hold on.  Let's think of a word.  What is the word?  This woman said...  Is there a U in there?  An apostrophe?  What?  I got this...  Hold on, Marge.  ...what a man said.  Starts with F and ends with N.  F and ends with N pills.  Don't do what they're supposed to do.  I may as well give them to the dog.  And starts with F.  Oh.  Ends with N.  Oh, okay.  Also, this woman's husband isn't getting Viagra'd up, so she's going to give it to your dog.  Wait, wait, all right. 
[01:49:00]  Wait, the female is saying these pills don't work, right?  Yeah.  Because the guy is using the pills for some young chippy, you dummy.  That's what, when they show Viagra commercials, they shouldn't show a guy who looks like, oh,  geez, I just can't...  They should show this woman, look at this woman who's as ugly as your ugly, smelly wife.  Here's a pill.  So you can...  They should show a guy with a...  Shut up, Marge.  They should show a guy with a satisfied fat chick, and then he's bilking her out of her  life savings.  Like how great Viagra can be for you financially. 
[01:49:30]  She's crumbled in an emotional mess on a hotel floor.  Tell me when I can do it.  You're skipping...  Yes, Marge.  ...with millions.  Yes, Marge.  Okay.  Got an email saying, everyone in the office is sneaking one pill from her husband's back.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Most of us agree that the dog deserves the pill more than the guy's.  But you don't need that many pills.  Yeah, it sounds like a movie with Lily Tomlin in it.  I'll make this public and that.  Girls, let's get all the Viagra from our... 
[01:50:00]  I have a feeling that...  No good husbands.  I have a feeling that Marge is selling Viagra.  ...to that dog.  Some Dolly Parton comedy that nobody wants to see.  I have a feeling that she's selling Viagra out the back door at the little shelter.  I'm going to have to go back to bed again.  No, you're fine, Marge.  How's the catatorium doing?  Why do you have to go back to bed again?  Is the Viagra kicking in at the shelter?  I don't need Viagra.  Well, we didn't think you did.  Okay. 
[01:50:30]  You give it to the dogs and then you pull out the peanut butter.  I do not...  You've heard the stories.  I've seen the videos.  I do not need Viagra.  How is the...  Wasn't the roof leaking on the catatorium or the cateteria?  What is that called?  It's a cattery.  Cattery.  The cattery.  Wasn't the roof leaking?  We need money.  Were you plugging it up with Viagra?  And, you know, if you would be so kind,  as to do a remote from Little Shelter... 
[01:51:00]  Do you understand, Marge?  Marge, listen to me for a second.  You know about animals and the shelter and everything.  We know radio.  Do you know how utterly boring it would be  for us to actually broadcast from a shelter?  Yeah, Ope, how are you doing today?  Bark, bark, bark, bark.  Just like yapping cats and dogs and hissing cats.  What would we say?  Give us a good break.  Give us...  How can I make you a bet?  You direct right now.  Give us a break that we would do from the Little Shelter. 
[01:51:30]  Go.  If you let them kill three cats during the show.  That's what I suggested.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  I bet you, and you can ask your producer  and all the directors and all the...  You think we have directors and producers?  Have you heard this show before?  It can't be.  Really, none of your animals deserve to die  to give publicity to the others.  Just choose your three least favorite cats  and kill them on the air,  and your shelter will be March gold-plated. 
[01:52:00]  Louis is on to something.  Yeah.  If you choke out a cat right now,  live on our show, we will do...  Oh, my God, a remote.  A remote from a little shelter.  You know there's one cat in there  that you're just like,  shut up, I hate this cat.  Even March, there's one that you're just like,  oh, I hate this cat.  You know you're putting at least one cat down today  because we know what you're really about.  So why don't you just choke it out live on the show,  knowing it's going to be dead anyway by the end of the day,  and then we get some good radio,  then we go down there and give you some boring radio.  Now, we've been voted the best shelter on Long Island.  Okay? 
[01:52:30]  Wait, hold on, Marge.  Who voted?  Yeah, who voted?  I didn't get a ballad.  Was there a booth with a hole in it?  The people who gave Mike North the Man of the Year award.  Yeah, they are.  They're the ones who gave her the...  Who is Irv Cupsinette?  What?  Who is Irv Cupsinette?  I don't know.  Irv Cupsinette, he's very big in Chicago.  Don't say his name and don't...  No, no, no, that was the award.  Oh, it was.  Mike North the Man of the Year award.  I thought he was like a reporter or something, a writer.  Wow, I don't know.  Maybe you know more than us about radio there, Marge. 
[01:53:00]  Maybe we should do a remote.  Hey, Marge, you getting any action or what?  Yeah, Marge, let's get us a little bit.  We want to know a little bit more about Marge.  We want to know a little bit about Marge.  You know so much about us.  When was the last time you had a little romp in the hay?  Yeah.  I'm not saying.  Come on.  Oh, come on.  Who was president?  No, you can ask me certain questions.  With a non-white.  When's the last time you rolled around with a non-white?  Gentlemen.  Yes.  If you come to Little Shelter... 
[01:53:30]  How close did you get to having relations with a dog?  Let's get into this for real.  ...about my personal life.  What?  Oh.  What?  I saw a picture of Marge.  I think she's a goer.  How old is Marge?  I think she'll go.  Marge, how old are you?  I'm not saying.  You should be on a smuggish job.  All right, Marge, last time that you did have an evening with a gentleman, did you feel...  Right afterwards, did you feel good or silly?  Oh, that's a good question.  Or sad?  I'll get to that question.  That's a good question.  Give me three options.  Okay, silly, sad, unconscious, hog-tied, black and blued, go ahead, three. 
[01:54:00]  Okay, delicious, ashamed, good one.  Delicious, ashamed, or...  Or wanting more.  Or sleepy.  Or up 15 bucks.  I will answer the question.  Okay, how'd you feel?  Oh, all right, Marge. 
[01:54:30]  Delicious.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's what the dog thought.  Why'd you feel delicious?  Delicious, Marge.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Why?  Because it's personal.  Because she's a sexy woman.  Is it a man you see from time to time, or what?  Yep.  Oh, you're not married?  Are you married?  Nope.  He is, though, right?  Nope.  Oh, there was a pause there.  What was the pause?  We know all about the pause.  I don't mean the pause that you're, you know, cutting off. 
[01:55:00]  We're not talking about the pause and their marks on your back.  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds so they don't scratch Marge up.  Do you at least let the cats watch?  Oven mitts.  Do you at least let the cats watch?  Those dewclaws are a bitch.  They have to tape the oven mitts so they don't fall off the German shepherds' hands, and he just feels silly.  You know the cats are watching because they're voyeuristic freaks.  Come on, Marge. 
[01:55:30]  The big things, and don't make a mistake about the big things.  What?  One of the surprising things, as I said, is how many women are responding.  Oh, really?  And listen to this.  Okay.  This is a little tidbit.  My girlfriend and I were watching the news and saw Ingrid.  We are both dog lovers, so we decided to make a supreme sacrifice and send 10 pills.  Now, wait.  She says, we don't do it that often anyway.  Well, but see, what you don't understand, Marge, is the guy is still doing it somewhere else. 
[01:56:00]  These are women, honey.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, she's saying we don't do it often.  Did you know that women take Viagra, too?  Yeah, I've heard.  So, I mean, this is...  Wayne, in Franklin Square, you're on with Marge from the Little Shelter.  How you doing, boys?  Hey.  Little Jimmy.  Hi.  Marge, I represent an auto parts store in Franklin Square, Long Island. 
[01:56:30]  It's called US1 Auto Parts.  We will donate $500 to the cattery of Little Shelter if you club a puppy over the head with a miniature souvenir baseball bat.  Marge, will you hit a puppy on his head with a little souvenir baseball bat for $500 for your cattery?  I think this is an excellent...  I would hit him with a club, and I don't want the $500.  He should just pass away.  No, not Wayne from Franklin Square.  Not Wayne? 
[01:57:00]  A puppy.  No, the puppy.  Just pick one of the dogs you're putting down today anyway.  Nobody touches a hair on any animal's head.  Wait, let's CBS make some money.  Little Shelter.  Hold on.  Let's CBS make some money.  How about with one of those Bud Light baseball bat bottles?  Oh, nice.  We get it sponsored.  Yeah.  Gentlemen.  Yes.  Yes, Marge.  How come you don't put a call through from a person that understands our plight?  You really think the board is lit up?  No, they are.  You know, Marge is...  Hold on, Marge. 
[01:57:30]  You're right.  When you're right, you're right.  You know, we like to have all voices heard on our show, so we do have one of those.  It's Matt in Connecticut.  You're on with me.  It's from Connecticut.  A very civilized state, Marge.  Yes, they're very...  Yes, exactly.  Go ahead, Matt.  You're on with...  Matt, you're on with Marge from Little Shelter.  Good morning, Matt.  I think it'd be more interesting if you hit the puppy with a fucking golf club.  Well.  Matt, you're not allowed to say that word.  I can't really say it.  Just keep it off in the front yard.  What, golf club?  Come on, guys.  Do me a favor. 
[01:58:00]  One call.  But this is a great formula.  One call.  Half your animals will live like kings.  The other half get hurt badly.  All right, look.  Give us a call.  That's like a pretty good...  Give me one...  Give us a call.  Serious comments only for Marge and serious inquiries only, please.  We are in America, and we should run your shelter like we run America.  Some people have it really good, and others...  Yeah, other people have to...  Others don't have it too well.  Yeah, other people are homeless.  Right, so...  Yeah.  I'm telling you right now, if you do something unusual to one of your pets at Little Shelter, 
[01:58:30]  we'll open the floodgates.  Other pets will prosper.  And then we'll never be able to see eye to eye.  Uh, Marge...  I love that she's asleep.  She's so rational.  She's so solemn.  Marge, think of this.  Look, could you just get one of the dogs and just smack him across the face so he goes...  Just one little yelp from the dog.  That would be worth $100 from me.  That's...  I'm throwing in another $100.  Yeah, we got $200 right there.  I'll give $500.  $700.  $700 we're up to. 
[01:59:00]  I can smack Matt across the face.  No.  No.  Just smack the dog till it goes...  I would...  You guys...  He'll forget.  He's a dog.  He won't even remember why you smacked him.  And then you'll have money for the cattery.  I hit my dog all the time by mistake.  Yeah.  She thinks, like, sometimes I'll turn it around, and I elbow my dog.  Shut up.  Shut up for a second.  Like, I don't even know this woman.  I'll elbow my dog in the eye by mistake.  That's an accident.  And she yelps and looks at me like, I'm sorry that I was standing here. 
[01:59:30]  That the dog did something wrong.  And I can't explain.  My dog does not believe that it's an accident.  My dog thinks I hit her on purpose.  Right.  And then it goes...  And then I pat her on the head.  It's over.  And they forget it.  How about we...  I have sex with her, but that's an odd one.  All right.  Hold on.  We have to take a break, Marge.  I think it's only fair that we take a couple serious questions for you.  Yeah.  We're going to get a bunch of people that want to talk to you about the little shelter.  So, could you hold on the line throughout the commercials, Marge?  Marge?  Marge?  Hello.  You hold on through the commercials.  Before I...  Shut up.  We have to go to a commercial, Marge. 
[02:00:00]  I know, but I have to take a whiff of oxygen.  Oh.  Are you kidding?  Okay.  Do the hatch.  Yeah.  You know what?  Light a cigarette at the same time.  That's what half the dogs are saying over there, but they don't get that opportunity.  Not oxygen.  How do they?  Okay.  Zyklon B that she's dropping through the cattery roof.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got me wowed.  We tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website. 
[02:00:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just phonies all over the place.  Good story, Louie.  We'll have to be phonies.  I don't know if we have time to tell it now.  It's Opie and Anthony, Louie C.K. in studio.  His HBO special comes out on DVD in a week?  June 26th.  June 26th.  Fameless.  Tuesday.  That's right.  Everything comes out on a Tuesday.  That's right. 
[02:01:00]  It's going to do very well with our audience.  I hope so.  I guess you...  It's a good story.  You got into a text battle with Man Cow.  Yeah.  Man Cow.  I'd been on his show in Chicago before, and he liked me, and he took my phone number,  so I always get these texts from him saying, hey, I'm going to be on Fox News like he promotes  to me and his other text pals, I guess.  When Imus went off the air, the first thing he wrote to me was, I'm going to get Imus' job. 
[02:01:30]  That's what he really wants.  Oh, yeah.  And then when he didn't get Imus' jobs, by the way, he's blaming us, because he's basically  saying now to the people that will still listen to him and think that he's not full of crap.  Yeah, they don't like me over there because I don't support Opie and Anthony.  I tried Opie and Anthony.  That's why they didn't give me the Imus station.  Yeah, that's why.  He just lies through his teeth.  He also said that CBS...  I just saw something.  I think it was either online or in one of the newspapers. 
[02:02:00]  It was some, like...  Oh, that's what it was.  Some real small town, local yokel newspaper thing that was online.  And he said that they offered him the job that we have right now.  The one that replaced David Lee Roth after he replaced Stern.  Right.  They offered him that job, CBS.  Yeah.  And I turned it down because I didn't want to go to New York.  Yeah.  That's what you wanted to do.  Yeah.  But he would have come here to...  But so then I saw him on Hannity and... 
[02:02:30]  When you guys got suspended, I saw him on Hannity and Combs saying,  they should be thrown off the air.  They're terrible people.  They're liberals.  Yeah.  And here's to me...  They're liberals.  Yeah.  Nothing makes me madder than a guy who's a radio personality hoping for somebody else to get censored.  It's censored.  It's the most disgusting...  Especially because he just wants the airtime for himself.  Of course he does.  And he doesn't think that's going to bite him in the ass.  Like, two years from now, he's going to say, fart and get fired.  And get fired. 
[02:03:00]  He doesn't know that it's going to get worse.  And so I wrote him a little text just responding to his latest self-promotion and said,  Lose my phone number.  I don't like you.  You're full of BS.  I saw you on Hannity and Combs.  Go to hell.  And he wrote back and said, Hey, we're all full of BS.  Ah, sure.  I'm looking forward to having you on my show and promoting your next project.  Like, trying to remind me that somehow he's bread on my butter.  And I wrote back and said, No, really.  Lose my number.  Don't write me anymore.  You're disgusting.  Yes.  And we went back and forth a few times. 
[02:03:30]  Louis C.K., get his HBO special on DVD.  That's coming today.  Louis doesn't mince his texts.  And buy my stuff.  If you don't hear it here, I'll be promoting my man cow now.  Yeah, he's full of crap.  And I think people are finally seeing what he's really about.  Self-promotion.  Doesn't give a crap who he's going to roll over to get there.  And doesn't realize that they're going to come after him next.  Of course they are.  And he's a liar.  He just lies.  He's had so many more FCC fines than we ever had. 
[02:04:00]  And he's done despicable things in his career.  But he wants to make believe he's not about that anymore.  No, and the great thing was that Sean Hannity defended you guys.  He was like not letting them do it.  He's going, No, people can change the channel if they want.  And Sean Hannity is a conservative.  Yep.  But he's rational.  Yeah, Sean Hannity was great as far as our situation goes.  He was a sane voice on TV.  I greatly appreciate that.  The only one.  We actually got to talk to him about the whole thing a couple weeks ago. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, he's a stand-up guy.  He's a good guy, man.  He didn't, ah, whatever.  Hannity.  We could get into it another day when we have a little more time.  We got Marge from Little Shelter.  Marge.  Now, Marge.  Beat your dogs.  Hi, Marge.  Beat your dogs for money.  That's the promotion we want to do.  That's what you should say.  Beat a dog for money for the cats.  Marge.  It's like a cartoon.  Marge, you promised me that you were going to have some nice calls.  Yeah, we've been going through the calls for the last 15 minutes.  It's very hard, but we've screened a few calls that are very supportive of you and the Little Shelter and your cause. 
[02:05:00]  Can I just, let me just ask one question, which is kind of like when you ask a woman, like, for $10 million, you know, and then you go, now we're just negotiating price that whole time.  Well, Marge, if we raised a million dollars for you, contingent on you just slapping one dog in the face.  The answer is no.  Really?  A million dollars.  A million dollars.  To sacrifice one dog's, like, feelings for a second to help all those other animals. 
[02:05:30]  Think about it.  Nope.  That's like a hero dog.  What about $100 million, with which, if you had $100 million, you could save every dog and cat in the world.  Yeah.  You would literally save both species.  We know that we can.  You could change the name to the Big Shelter, finally.  Marge.  The Big Shelter.  Marge, you're not saying, we do this with humans.  Why not with pets?  You would not slap a dog in the face to save thousands.  People that look are much nicer than people that just look.  No, they're right.  Marge, how about this? 
[02:06:00]  Would you say for $50, take a thumbtack and stick a note to a dog's nose that says, I'm a dog, I suck.  That little leathery nose, all wet.  All he would have is a little red dot there for about a week, and he'd be fine.  We're going to make Marge go back to bed again.  You know this, right?  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Just remember this.  You've got 300 Viagra pills coming illegally in the mail through the little shelter, thanks to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:06:30]  Marge, can I ask you one thing?  Blood on the note.  For all the money you could imagine, would you just take a dachshund or a basset hound, you know a basset hound, right, with those big floppy ears,  and hold the ears together above his head and staple them together so he looks silly?  Yeah.  No, but I would staple your ears together.  Oh.  Oh, no, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  For $100,000, would you take a dog's face and just look at it and say, you stink? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, would you even talk to a dog mean?  Yeah.  For $100,000.  For $100,000.  Would you talk mean to a dog?  Would you tell your favorite dog that he stinks?  Wait a minute.  Let me, let me, let me, because, you know, sometimes it's the tone and the voice.  No, it has to be the real tone.  You got to sell it.  No, you got, yeah, you, Marge, you got to sell it.  $100,000.  Sell it like you're yelling at a guy who didn't satisfy you in bed.  $100,000.  I could say something to...  Like what?  ...one of my little friends like this. 
[02:07:30]  What would you say?  You know, honey.  No.  Honey.  No, Marge.  It better be, you know, honey, I'm sorry I chopped your nose off.  I can't start an insult with, you know, honey.  Marge, let me, I told you.  You made, you made an offer.  Now, let's see if you're going to stick to the...  I didn't make an offer.  I said if.  I, the, the, the key word was if.  So, let me...  These are hypothetical situations like OJ's murder.  All right.  That is a hypothetical answer, okay?  All right.  Hypothetical answer.  For $100,000, right? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  I would take a little face in my hand.  And I would say for that little face, with a smile on my face.  Aw.  Oh, sweetheart.  No.  No.  I really don't like you that much.  Oh, wow.  I would almost pay that.  That's almost good.  That's almost good.  I would pay $100 for that.  Where's the $100,000?  We said F, Marge.  I said it was hypothetical.  For that, I would give you $100.  Marge, you got the 300 Viagra pills coming in out of the mail illegally. 
[02:08:30]  Remember that.  And when they bust you for drug trafficking, leave our names out of it.  How much ecstasy you need?  That's going to be shipped to the little shelter.  You're going to have mobsters coming to the back door looking for dope.  Marge, here's a real offer.  Okay?  The guys have been silly geese.  My apologies.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how I accept them.  Take a chihuahua.  And this is for $63.  $63.  And I want you to grab the chihuahua by its ears.  And I want you to squeeze its ears until your knuckles, until your fingernails are digging 
[02:09:00]  back into your own skin through its ears.  And I want you to put your face by it with your old lady breath.  And I want you to scream racial epithets into its face.  $63 there, Marge.  That's $63.  Dollar Roonies.  How about...  By the way, Marge, I have to thank you.  I get the little shelter...  The address labels all the time.  So I...  You know, it's got my name on it.  Yeah.  And my address.  And I'm able to mail things out.  Yeah.  I throw away everything else that comes with it, but I use the address labels. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you.  Hey, let's get back to the chihuahua.  How about this?  Let's just get silly with the chihuahua and get him penis enlargement surgery.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Them walking around?  Just give him a...  If you take a chihuahua and have a friend of yours hold its paw and walk away from your  friend, like 10 feet away, and your friend has to still be holding the paw, then you  have to still have the chihuahua in your hands.  You can figure out how that's done.  You can have $88.42. 
[02:10:00]  Marge, let's calm you down.  And Marge, let's calm you down a little bit.  We're running out of show on this side of the Opie and Anthony program.  We got a little song we want you to hear.  Oh.  This will get everyone calm.  Okay.  This is like a fundraiser song.  You know how they do it on the Jerry Lewis telethon?  They play music.  Well, here you go.  Are you going to come to...  If you like this song...  Send your contributions.  Send your Viagra and all your illegal drugs to the little shelter out there in Hurricane.  I have money.  Marge needs crystal meth. 
[02:10:30]  Here we go.  Starts off nice, right?  It's nice.  It's a sing-along.  This is good.  It really is.  It's pretty.  Pretty guitar.  Follow the bouncing balls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting.  It helps a lot if you kill a kitten.  Mark my words.  It's a nice song.  It's pretty.  It's from where I'm sitting. 
[02:11:00]  You can't go wrong if you kill a kitten.  Listen close, Marge.  I don't.  Here comes this part.  You'll love it.  It's both.  Pretty.  There's no crime that you'll be committing.  I know the law you can...  Everybody.  Kill a kitten.  Come on, Marge.  Marge, sing along. 
[02:11:30]  It's kill a kitten.  Come on, Marge.  Ready?  Kill a kitten.  Come on, Marge.  Sing along.  Listen, here's some ideas.  This should be on the song.  Her saying that in the background.  You awful.  Warns to cure you heavy young kids.  Some love dogs used to take a...  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten. 
[02:12:00]  What is she saying?  She's just not happy with the song, I don't think.  Suggesting methods.  What, Marge?  Problem, Marge?  I said, didn't you take your little doggies with you?  When you went to the fishing hole.  Yes.  What the hell here is this?  It sounds like Anthony Hopkins.  We were...  Didn't you take your little doggies with you?  I brought my pit boy.  When you went to the fishing hole, Clarice.  Yes, I'm Huck Finn.  My German shepherd chased Jim into the water.  Me, Weezer, and Jack. 
[02:12:30]  And Petey came along with us.  All right, Marge, we're running out of show.  If Huck Finn had a dog,  Jeremy shepherd that book would have been one page thick.  So this is what we learned.  We learned that Marge needs Viagra for the female dogs  and bear traps, right?  No comment.  Money for the cattery.  She's tired.  She's got to go back to bed.  Now, we actually need money for the little shelter medical center.  Medical center?  All right, Marge.  What the hell is it?  Something new every time.  There's going to be a complex down Warner Road 
[02:13:00]  that takes up a mile.  Son of a grand.  With all the money you're going to be getting.  Come on, guys.  All right, Marge.  All right, Marge.  We've got to go.  We've got to go.  Give generously to the little shelter.  We're kind of fading you out  like you fade out the lives of some of those animals down there.  Goodbye, Marge.  Turning on the gas.  Louis C.K., thank you.  Thank you.  He's joining us on the other side.  Of course.  Let's make sure everyone knows  that the DVD for his HBO special comes out Tuesday, okay?  Shameless.  Louis C.K., everybody.  If you're not joining us over there,  have a good day. 
[02:13:30]  We'll see you.  The DVD show.  The virus is spring.  Places.  Places, everyone.  It's so odd not doing the show from the SM studio. 
[02:14:00]  That's why we take such a long break in between shows.  We're actually walking to another studio.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very far, though.  It's further than the old one.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  I guess they're...  Have they started the construction project?  Wait a minute.  What?  Because I hear Ron and Fez were doing the show  from the little phone booth studio.  So why can't they do it from the big studio  if they haven't started work yet?  What do you mean they haven't started work yet?  Or Ron and Fez have... 
[02:14:30]  Dude, you know that little closet studio?  It's as big as that bathroom.  They have actually been doing their show.  Could you imagine us trying to do that?  Consummate professional that Ron Bennington...  Are you acknowledging a show I have no interest in?  Wow.  You're not going to the big wedding tomorrow?  Hell no.  Is that tomorrow?  Yes.  I'm definitely going to the big wedding.  Eastside Dave?  Hell no.  I'm not going to be part of that sham.  Lovely Casey.  Sham?  It's a sham.  They're in love.  They're young and in love.  It's sweet.  I thought it was a goof, too,  until I saw them talking, 
[02:15:00]  and it really bugged me,  because I was seeing him naked.  He's packing nothing.  And I actually...  How would I go to that?  He's got a flat Irish ass.  He's awful.  It's a sham.  Wait, is...  Ronnie should be running for the WWE at this point.  Who are we kidding?  Wait, so...  Stupid sham.  Stupid sham.  Are you going?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm going.  It's, what, the Hard Rock Cafe?  Oh, are you guys going to all be fooled?  Fooled?  When there's a confrontation,  and I ain't marrying you,  and someone marches out.  And throws sand in someone's face, 
[02:15:30]  and they get hit with a chair.  Yeah, exactly.  The only thing I'm thinking,  and that's funny that you say that,  because I'm like...  It's going to end with an elbow to someone's face.  I'm thinking,  should I give money as a gift?  Oh, God.  What is wrong with you?  Because I'm thinking,  if they really get married,  I've got to give a gift.  Yeah.  But then if they don't,  if they're not,  then I'll seem silly.  I'll feel silly.  You brought this to the table a long time ago.  You've been to weddings to the point  where you know, like,  the marriage is never going to last,  so you start with, like, 
[02:16:00]  $200 in your envelope,  and then you go to the bar,  and you start taking the money out of the envelope  that you reserve for the couple.  Yeah, because you realize it's not going to work.  Dave's too much of a drunk for her, I think.  Like, Dave is just so drunk all the time.  I know what I think is going to happen tomorrow.  If you get married,  it doesn't matter until you have kids.  It's just stupid.  It's just dating.  Yeah, it is.  It's dating with a contract.  Dating with a one-sided contract.  This is my prediction. 
[02:16:30]  Tomorrow, there is no wedding.  Who's he marrying?  Casey.  Casey, all right.  Casey admits that she's pregnant,  and the place goes nuts,  and then everyone's going to be like,  ooh, that means this wedding's even...  But it's Earl's baby.  Thank you.  You read my mind.  But that's so phony,  because everyone knows  Earl doesn't even have sex.  That's the beauty of the thing.  That is outrage,  and then there's like a...  No, that's what Ope says is going to happen.  ...a fight,  and then Eastside Dave marches out. 
[02:17:00]  You think that's the way it's going to happen?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  So I'm looking forward to seeing what happens.  All right.  Is Fez going to be there?  Is he here?  Fez.  Poor Fez.  Oh, was he a wreck yesterday?  Why was he a wreck yesterday?  He just started crying again.  I feel so bad for the guy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He made a mistake and said that Tiger Woods' son was named Sam,  and that's like a plain name for a baby. 
[02:17:30]  And then it was pointed out that it's Sam, a girl.  Right.  And then Fez was like,  oh, I got it wrong.  And he started crying that he got it wrong.  I'm sitting at home listening going,  oh, my God, he's losing his mind.  He's crying because he got it wrong.  He should be.  That's how you respond to an error.  You weep,  and then you do a mea culpa on your knees  and take a mouthful of...  Why am I trying to...  You suck dicks.  Yeah, right?  I forgot where we were on XM. 
[02:18:00]  It's weirdly difficult.  When you walk over,  you forget that you can just say cunt  and put his vagina in my face.  Oh, this is still on!  Oh, no.  Of course it's not still on.  They'll dump it out anyway.  But, yeah, he started crying again  because I guess his psych drugs  weren't working as well as he thought.  But he's just got to give it a little time, I think.  That's a sweet boy.  It's one of those...  He's too emotional.  He's too sensitive.  So he made the mistake.  Well, maybe that too. 
[02:18:30]  He's just...  He's got to realize  that he can make these little mistakes  and it doesn't matter.  And then Ron just lays into him.  Hey, Ron, he just goes with the flow.  Yeah.  Look how well you made a big error.  You know, you got the baby's sex wrong.  That is a big mistake there, Fez.  And Sam, probably after Sam Sneed or something.  I'm thinking he went with a golf thing.  Oh, okay.  See, I didn't even think of that.  Because Sam is such a weird name  to name your kid.  Do you think that's the end of Tiger, though?  Sorry, Taro.  I don't Sam, by the way.  Oh.  Do you think that's the end of Tiger 
[02:19:00]  and his...  He will see the baby maybe once a week.  Oh, yeah.  Nanny?  Yeah, he's too rich.  Yeah.  He'll have other people raise his kids.  Rich people really don't raise their kids like that.  He'll have a putter in his hand  and just kind of peek.  That's an investment.  He'll hold the baby every once in a while  when it's all cleaned up  and it's burped and stuff.  That is an investment right there.  Him having sex and having a baby  is like buying a stock for him.  You hand that kid a golf club  and that is it.  Yep. 
[02:19:30]  In a few years,  that kid's going to be doing commercials.  All he's got to do is get old enough to...  He's just got to be old enough  to swing that club.  It's a girl.  And the endorsement deals.  Him?  It's a girl.  Sam.  Oh, I said him?  Yes.  Are you going to start crying?  I'm sorry.  I'm an idiot.  I made that mistake  with a mouth on my dick  and I didn't cry.  I thought it was a her.  Someone is suggesting that...  It was a fabricated dick.  Yeah, that deserves tears  when that happens.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a guy. 
[02:20:00]  Someone is suggesting  that Dave and Casey's limo may blow up.  Oh, now that would be interesting.  WWE style.  Why not?  That's fantastic.  Well, I wish him the best  and tomorrow I'll be there  to watch them show each other  how much they love each other.  Good luck to everybody  at that sham.  I don't care if they all die.  They all die.  I don't care if the place burns.  I know them.  I feel that way.  I hope the exits get blocked  and there's a fire. 
[02:20:30]  And all the plastic cutlery  gets fucking melted  under their face  and curls up.  It's just because I don't know.  The knives curling.  I hope that of all people,  I don't know.  Hey, excuse me.  Idea for the show, by the way.  Yes.  They are building a state-of-the-art studio  for us over that other joint.  Yep.  Why not take one picture a day  to show what's going on over there?  Oh, there you go.  That's it.  A montage.  Same exact position  one picture every day.  And then you can run them together  and play that horse racing music. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  Are we going to do this?  But I don't want,  I want the picture up every day.  Okay.  Because then I want to make fun  of how slow the whole thing  is coming along.  Give me this cue, Opie.  What's up, P-Rock?  It'll just look like  a still picture.  Yeah.  Right.  It'll be a movie,  but it'll just be a still picture.  If the guys didn't update  the picture for the last 90 days.  No, that's funny.  You know how when they do that,  the people look like  they're moving in fast motion,  and you see the building go up.  It'll be that fast, 
[02:21:30]  but you'll still see people  just milling about slowly  because they're actually moving  that slow.  Wow, this guy,  this guy got really angry.  Fuck you, Opie.  Utah Sam.  Oh, because his name is Sam?  Yeah.  Look, you could say  Louie, the name sucks,  and I'd lick your asshole  out for you.  Wait, do you want...  Louie.  Wait, Ant wants...  That's a good name.  What?  What did I do?  Ant wants a montage.  Montage.  Thank you.  He's obligated to say it 
[02:22:00]  in that higher pitch.  He missed it before, though.  He did.  Yeah, so we get to spank him.  Pull down your pants.  He's waiting for secret letters  that he slid under doors.  Is it Butt Rub Wednesday?  I think it is.  Butt Rub Wednesday.  It certainly is Butt Rub Wednesday.  I totally forgot  about Butt Rub Wednesday.  Jimmy?  I'm ready.  E-Rock?  No.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Butt Rub Wednesday.  You're part of this program.  Get up.  No.  Get up.  E-Rock.  How about we do it behind?  Always getting nervous.  Why?  What happens here? 
[02:22:30]  I don't want to do it again.  Yeah, but Louie hasn't seen  Butt Rub Wednesday yet.  What happens?  A video.  Huh?  A couple of men rubbed  their ass cheeks together.  How about two men  rubbed their ass cheeks together?  Yeah.  It's not sexual at all.  No.  It's not gay or anything.  It's like this little tent  I'm getting in my jeans.  Butt Rub Wednesday.  Butt Rub Wednesday.  Butt Rub Wednesday.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Butt Rub Wednesday.  E-Rock.  Come on, E-Rock.  No.  You just gotta stand up 
[02:23:00]  and rub your butt on Jimmy's.  That's right.  E-Rock.  Come on, Jimmy.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Iraq  Iraq  Iraq  Iraq  blabba  not rub Wednesday  AM  them scrolling through pictures 
[02:23:30]  why will strike off to you  that the right here let's react a video  How about behind the pal-talk cameras, just for Louie's sake?  Come on, man.  I want the cameras to see it.  I want them to see our ass cheeks meeting.  How did this start?  I just decided.  You just decided.  It was a punishment at first.  Who will rub butts with Jimmy today?  Come on.  Danny will do it, I'm sure.  Have you heard that story I used to tell on stage? 
[02:24:00]  When I was nine years old, me and my friend both started masturbating.  And he'd push his dick into his hand on his stomach.  There's actually websites that explain that you shouldn't do that.  It's a way some boys masturbate.  Like, they apply pressure.  Really?  And it hurts your dick.  Like, it does long-term damage.  Do they go up and down or just push on it like they're giving it CPR?  Yeah.  Like, it's a palpite.  Yeah, the head swells.  Yeah.  And so he asked me to sit on his ass while he was doing it.  So there would be more pressure. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, he was kind of, like, humping his hand.  Yeah.  It's not gay, because he just needed more pressure.  And you had to sit on his ass.  He just sat on his naked ass.  With your pants on?  It's weird that everybody asked that, because that wouldn't help.  No, no.  You know, but why is that?  You're right.  That is an odd point.  The first thing everybody asks is, did you have to wear your pants on?  They were on, yeah.  I think.  Oh, boy.  I don't remember.  As I came to, I was looking at Charlie's pants went down.  My naked butt was next to Charlie's naked butt.  Charlie was masturbating. 
[02:25:00]  Hey, who's this kid?  Sam?  Yeah.  Sam, you're a...  Sam is sick.  Who the fuck are you?  I'm Noah.  Noah.  Yes.  And what do you do here?  I don't know, Sam.  Are you a board op or something?  What do you do?  Do you work here?  Yes, I am an intern.  Oh, you're an intern for this show?  Yes.  Oh.  Wow.  How long have you been here?  Why don't you have a name tag?  Why doesn't he have a name tag?  I don't know.  How long have you been here?  Why does he suck, man?  Because he sucks?  Well, he should have a name tag.  Yeah, he should have a name tag. 
[02:25:30]  Why don't you tell him...  You know about the name tags?  Neat name tag.  Well, this is my fourth week here.  Four?  No way, you've been here four fucking weeks.  Yep.  I swear, I don't even know who he is.  I'd have had him removed from the building if I even saw him.  What have you done for four weeks?  I've gotten lots of food for people.  Yeah?  Me?  Yeah, I got you a bagel a couple times.  I don't even remember.  See, none of these guys on the family should bring something if they want to move up and be...  Wow.  All right, put some glass in the bagel and then grind some glass, a great bit.  And then he goes, Anthony goes, who got it? 
[02:26:00]  And his tongue is bleeding.  Who did this?  And I can't even talk.  Noah!  Come on, then I'd remember you.  All right, kid, I got to keep you close.  It is true that the intern program is just us getting waiters for our show.  It's really fallen off since our first crop of interns who are now employees.  Like all the guys that work for us, they were interns.  That was the first round for the most part.  And then it just...  And then what, are they going to give their jobs to new interns?  Yeah.  No.  So they are really...  I think they might be discouraging the interns.  You're right.  To not contribute. 
[02:26:30]  That's how America works.  And do well so they don't get replaced.  Yes.  That could happen.  The situation gets in and then gives the other jobs to their shitty brothers and sisters.  Right.  All right, why are we...  That could happen.  Why is Noah here?  I think he has the potential and he could bring something to the show for Butt Rub Wednesday.  Wow.  Wow.  I thought he would be a good candidate.  That's all.  You think I'm rubbing asses with that bucket with an intern?  Bring me Renee.  What's so great about E-Ruck?  Yeah, right.  There's a fucking chicken turn.  E-Ruck guy, if you're going to rub asses... 
[02:27:00]  So that means you like rubbing asses with E-Ruck.  There's something about him.  Yeah.  Yes.  What is it?  That's what I want to know.  His ass is supple.  Uh-huh.  You haven't seen this guy yet.  Look how...  Look how fair he is.  Look how milky he is.  He's a twink.  Fucking E-Ruck.  A twink.  You want a man.  No, I don't.  I wouldn't want that fucking E-Ruck.  E-Ruck is a fucking...  A meaty boy shirt wearing plump ass.  E-Ruck, come on.  Why don't you just rub butts with Jimmy?  Come on.  Look...  Come on. 
[02:27:30]  Look how young and awkward and unformed this guy is.  Exactly.  I'd rub fronts with his butt.  That was...  You what?  I'd rub...  I'd turn around and stick it in his shitter real quick.  Not even out of homosexuality.  Just out of hatred.  Yeah, but just because he got my order wrong.  Hatred.  Oh, shit.  Have you ever had a homosexual encounter?  Seriously.  No.  I don't believe you.  Wow.  I don't think I have.  Come on.  Oh, wait.  Maybe...  That wasn't hard.  He just found out about as fast as a breakdown. 
[02:28:00]  You ever done anything gay?  No.  I don't believe you.  Well, um...  Well, I might have.  You got me.  Now, let's say I did have a homosexual.  It was me and Charlie.  Louie sat on a kid's ass.  I sat on a kid's ass.  I did things when I was a little boy.  I don't believe that you've never done anything.  I don't believe it.  I don't think so.  I'm completely hetero.  I'm not saying you're not hetero.  Did you ever do anything that was, like, on the borderline?  Like, sucking a black guy's dick for four hours?  No.  Like, you know those things where, if you look at it one way, it could be gay? 
[02:28:30]  How about this?  Did you ever open your mouth wide to have somebody hump your throat without it touching  your lips?  Because that technically is not gay.  It's not touching.  In case you want to let me do it.  That's just cool.  All right.  Nothing ever even close like you're in a tree fort with a friend and you had to make believe  you were asleep while he offered to give you a blowjob?  Never.  Nothing like that?  I don't believe you.  All right.  Let's see how fucking honest this dumb crew of interns is.  I want one of them to confess something they did when they were young that was fucking  homosexual in nature.  Get Pat Duffy.  Um, Pat Duffy. 
[02:29:00]  Who's that?  Pat not only licking the dick.  Pat's a creep.  Pat rubbed his face on it like it was catnip.  There's Pat Duffy.  God, I love this kid.  Pat Duffy has a huge fucking head.  Duffy.  No.  What do you got today?  Nothing gay?  Here comes Pat Duffy.  Anything gay?  I touched one of my friend's dick one time when I was a kid.  All right.  That's pretty gay.  What happened?  Yeah, give us the circumstance there.  Did he come in your Amish beard?  No.  Because you have an Amish beard with cum in it. 
[02:29:30]  Sorry.  That's why I asked.  No, when I was like eight or nine, my buddy, he used to sleep over every Friday.  He was 52.  He was in.  And, uh, I don't know if my buddy...  Always call me your buddy when you tell this story later.  Yes.  52-year-old buddy.  Now, shit to your mouth.  My buddy, Jebediah.  Just haven't had the same last name as you.  Jebediah.  It was at the barn raising. 
[02:30:00]  We built a barn and then carved a wooden horse.  And then I shit in his mouth as he jacked off in my face.  A brown-white 69.  I went at his cock like a butter churn.  I don't remember the exact circumstances of it, but I do remember.  I bet.  Another O.J.  Everyone's got the O.J. thing.  I drifted back in and I had a dick in my hand and I was horrified.  My clothes all wet with white stuff. 
[02:30:30]  Is this my cum?  Did I cum?  Charlie, what happened?  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ, O.J.  Jesus Christ, O.J.  You just fucked me in the ass.  I feel like a professional O.J.  Jesus, where'd you learn to do that?  Charlie fell asleep in the passenger seat.  Jesus Christ.  All I remember is I remember looking over because I was on the top bunk.  He was on the bottom and I looked over like this.  Wait a minute.  What buddy did you have bunk beds with?  Well, no.  Me and my brother shared a room and he had moved out by this point. 
[02:31:00]  He had moved out and then somebody moved in?  No, no, no.  A little sleepover.  Sleepover.  Oh, yeah, the sleepover.  Sure.  Right.  How old's your brother?  He's seven years older.  He's 27.  So you were how old when this happened?  I was 20.  Eight or nine.  Eight or nine.  So your brother moved out when he was 16 or 17?  No, all right.  I take that back.  Then I was probably like 10.  Oh, yeah.  The age goes up a little.  The timeline kills you every time.  Yeah, I don't remember.  He was petting his age going, wow.  These guys would understand if I was eight or nine.  I wasn't really thinking what I was doing.  10 is a little more. 
[02:31:30]  You get a little more.  10 is a little more.  I was 19.  So what happened?  No, I just remember looking over and for some reason he had his dick out and he was hard.  And I think he might have been jerking off because we were like, we had to be past the  point where we stopped talking.  We were like falling asleep.  And jokingly, I reached down like this with one finger out.  And he, no, and I was like, and I was like, what are you doing?  And I reached out and he thrust his penis forward and my, my finger came in contact with  it.  Now you were a little too close.  You would have said grab earlier.  You were a little, you didn't have him. 
[02:32:00]  God touching the little spark of life.  That's the finger.  That's nothing like, you know.  That's it?  Nothing like when your brother used to piss in your mouth from the top bunk.  I think there was more to that than just a little fingertip touching a thrusting hip.  Then again, I'll believe him more because he ate puke.  I don't believe him.  I don't believe him.  He was the kid on the lower bunk.  I think that he's had a couple of encounters.  I played Monster Rain when I was a kid.  I've confessed that to whoever would listen. 
[02:32:30]  Monster Rain?  Yeah, my Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  My friend and I would suck into the dicks.  What happened?  My friend and I would blow each other under a porch.  You never heard of us?  You called that a monster.  I know.  It needs a name other than blowing each other under a porch.  At that age, yeah.  We would yell Monster Rain and then to get away from the rain, we'd hide under a porch.  And the day could be sunny.  It wasn't raining.  Oh, yeah.  It really wasn't.  It didn't have to be raining.  They would say Monster Rain.  There was always a threat of rain.  Yeah, and you'd have to hide under the porch. 
[02:33:00]  They were always son's umbrella.  You'd have to suck each other's dicks.  All right, Pat Duffy.  Very good.  Okay.  All right, Iraq, just rub butts.  So what other interns do we have?  Just none?  Oh, yeah.  Well, then bring them in.  They're all lying.  Yeah, they're all lying.  They need to be interrogated.  Why won't Iraq rub butts?  Because he knows how good it feels.  And what happens is our asses touch, and we both get a magnetic reaction in the front.  But Iraq.  Oh, yes.  Iraq, why not do it again?  You did it once.  Who the hell are you?  I'm a new intern. 
[02:33:30]  What's your name?  Matt.  Matt.  Mm-hmm.  And how long have you been here?  A week.  Oh, okay.  I don't know who Matt is.  I've never seen Matt.  What do you do?  What have you done in your week here?  Get coffee.  Get breakfast.  Say.  Yeah.  Or waiters.  Waiters.  We should definitely train waiters.  What made you want to be an intern on this program?  They want to get on a radio instead of they're going to be.  About seven years or so.  You what?  I listen to the best.  Seven years.  I'll just be a fan.  Okay.  Yeah.  College or something?  Yes.  Where?  I'm at St. John's.  I don't care.  Do you want to be in the business? 
[02:34:00]  I wouldn't mind.  Good luck.  It's a hard hustle.  Thanks.  All right.  You ever suck a dick?  No.  Okay.  How about you?  No.  I've never sucked a dick.  Okay.  All right.  Mm.  Not quite getting it there.  What?  What happened?  I don't know.  Stan had a reference.  I didn't get it.  Really?  Yeah.  It happens.  What if you reward butt rubbing with extra intern duties?  Like give them real stuff to do.  No.  That'd be crazy.  Ever jack off in the same room as another guy at the same time? 
[02:34:30]  No.  No.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Perhaps when I was...  Maybe.  I might have been 14.  Yeah.  Cousins' house.  Cousins.  Cousins?  With cousins?  Yeah.  And you're just kind of like sleeping in the same room and what?  What happens?  Nothing happens.  Take it from there.  Well, take it from there.  Cool.  You're in the same room and go.  Go.  It was bunk beds.  Those are bunk beds.  I'll get you every time.  Fucking bunk beds.  I want gay kids. 
[02:35:00]  I'm getting bunk beds.  Fucking bunk beds are leading to homosexuality.  Right.  Because these families out there don't want to buy a bigger house.  The bunk beds.  The bunk beds.  Causing homosexuals.  And I don't remember how it started, but both jerked off.  I like your hand on your dick.  Yes.  It was similar to that.  I think you know how it started.  Of course you does.  Yeah.  Because 14, you know what's going on.  Yeah.  So what?  Was it a magazine being passed around or was it just a mental fantasy? 
[02:35:30]  What was the stimuli?  Hot ant.  The cousin?  I really actually don't remember.  You don't remember?  No.  I don't believe that.  Can you sit down for a second, please?  I'm having trouble looking.  Can you sit?  Just you.  You're confessing.  I don't believe him.  When I was like in fourth grade, me and my friend Mike, he had a scuba mask.  Yeah.  And we were taking the scuba mask and pressing our balls, taking balls against us.  It was like smooched against the glass.  We were just taking turns doing that and just looking at our dicks smashed up against the glass. 
[02:36:00]  Scuba glass.  Louie, that leads to one of our favorite bits.  Gay or funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Yeah.  There's things you do among other guys that you're just going for the laugh.  Gay or funny.  Right.  Gay or funny.  What was the one that we got the guy who they were swimming and you know how you try  to do a whole lap under the water?  Like, all right, your turn.  So the guy, this was told on.  Oh, yeah.  So the guy goes forward and he's underwater for the entire lap of the pool.  And as he jumps, you know, you get out on the other end. 
[02:36:30]  You get to the rim of the pool and you got to go like, breathe in.  You need a big gasp of air while there's his buddy waiting for him with his pants down  and his dick out.  So the second he breaks the water to breathe, he's got a face full of cock and an open mouth  going, that was a close one, but we determined that was funny as well.  That's pretty good.  We will take your gay or funny story.  Balls on the head at a party, like when you photograph your friends asleep.  No, see that's gay.  You stick your balls on his head.  I think that's gay. 
[02:37:00]  I think that's gay.  No way.  It's hack funny, so it's not funny.  Passed out guy with a scrotum on his head and you're taking pictures?  Funny.  The guy pulling his dick out at that point, his ball bag out.  Funny.  By the way, I got two pictures from somebody that I told to hold my camera at the virus  tour from the bathroom.  Yeah, I can imagine.  Yeah, two pictures.  Someone walked in on me and Florentine.  Was it me and Florentine that they were taking pictures of each other's assholes in a fucking  in a stall at somebody's wedding or something? 
[02:37:30]  And somebody walked in.  Oh, because you get the camera on the table?  On the table.  Yeah, so we were photographing each other's assholes in a stall and somebody walked in.  We might have been doing it at a gig or something.  Somebody with somebody else's camera.  And one of us was bent over with our fucking cheeks spread wide.  That gag is never old because I get the camera home and I'm looking and I see peeking out  of these jeans.  It looks like the head of that monster that Bugs Bunny was chasing around.  Monsters are such interesting people.  That's like. 
[02:38:00]  That heart-shaped monster?  Yeah, yeah.  That guy.  That's what was sticking out of these pants.  Old mushroom head.  Oh, my God.  It's like, what the fuck is going on?  Oh, my God.  So what's your name, son?  I'm Brian.  Okay, Brian.  So describe this scene now.  I believe you and I don't.  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're leaving something out.  I remember when I was finished, I was on the top bunk and dropping the tissues off.  Had it stuck.  Tissues.  Now, hold on.  Hold on.  This doesn't make sense either.  Yeah, now you're trying.  Now you're premeditated jerking because you're in the bunk bed. 
[02:38:30]  Top bunk or bottom bunk?  I was in top.  Top.  Even worse.  See?  You don't even have a bottom bunk where there might be tissues on a night table.  You brought tissues up with you for the purpose of jerking off.  That would make sense.  Okay, so then you know that you're jerking off, and there's a guy on the bunk bed underneath.  How'd you know he was jerking off?  With the whole bunk start moving?  I don't know.  Because he said, ready, set, go.  How'd you know?  You're getting an opposite?  Because you've got to get the rhythms right, or else it ends up like that film of that black 
[02:39:00]  and white bridge.  The bunk bed.  You get your rhythms wrong, and the bed breaks.  No, I honestly don't remember how it started.  No?  No.  I would tell you if I knew.  Okay.  So that was it?  You jerked off on the top bunk while someone else was sleeping?  Or was he jerking off?  He was.  He was jerking off, too.  I didn't know he was.  How did you know he was jerking?  You know how I knew my friend was blowing me because I felt his mouth on my dick?  So did you hear sounds?  Did you feel the movement of the bed?  I probably told me. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, he said, I'm jerking off, too.  Right.  And he went, so am I.  Okay.  That's a little something there, maybe.  Yeah, there's something there.  We'll give him another week.  Yeah.  If he doesn't tell us the details, he's out.  No, right.  He's out.  Yeah.  Gossamer, yes.  He's coming in like crazy.  Sweet.  Dogshit sniffer from Woodside.  Yes, that was me.  You said to your...  Let's think about how it started.  You said, I'm going to go up and jerk off, and you said, I'm going to stay down here and  jerk off?  Who do you think you're talking to? 
[02:40:00]  He was...  Jimmy was there.  Jimmy was basically there.  Jimmy gets pissed off because, like, an intern doesn't want to admit to the two countries  that he might have had a homosexual experience.  Me and my friends used to jerk off in the same room all the time.  Yeah.  He's only going to go...  One kid would tell you...  This is something me and my friend used to do.  One kid would tell...  He'd tell you a story about a girl you want to fuck, and you'd jerk off while you listen  to him tell the story.  And then you'd tell him a story, and he jacks off. 
[02:40:30]  That is a wacky...  And then you'd fuck each other.  If I heard the story first and jerked off, he'd say, my turn for a story.  He would have...  Yeah, right?  Who's telling the story after you come?  And then she and I goes off together.  Hey, let's say hi to Kenny.  We're kind of playing gay or funny a little bit here.  Kenny, what do you got?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got a friend of mine, actually two friends of mine, that, like, the one friend,  he always would do, like, stupid, like, gay shit all the time, but...  Stupid.  The other friend, not so much, but I think he did it kind of to freak them out, but they 
[02:41:00]  were at a party, and they were drunk, and he got totally naked, and they just started  wrestling completely naked.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  Don't even have to think.  There's nothing funny.  That's just gay.  Anything that happens next is...  Wait, wait, wait.  Falls under gay.  Was it?  Yeah.  It wasn't like a gay party.  Hold on, hold on.  We're going to help you out a little bit.  Was it after Borat?  No.  It was way before Borat.  How many people were at the party? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, it was like three years ago, two years ago.  How many people were at the party?  It was like 50, 60 people.  Not gay.  It's done for shock value to be funny.  Not gay.  Gay stuff isn't done in front of people to be a goof.  Dude, two guys wrestling naked.  That's funny.  People would go, oh, shit.  Were there any women there?  Yeah, there was plenty of girls, plenty of girls.  That ain't gay.  There's two guys fucking around, trying to be obnoxiously funny.  So you're saying, where's the line then?  If one guy's fucking another one up the S, but there's a large crowd, it's not gay? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, thank you, man.  Where's the line?  Yeah, that's what it was.  Where's the line, Jim?  They may have been trying to be funny, but it just seems way, way too gay.  One gets a boner and it's gay?  I'm sure it was gay, but there was too many people, you know.  If they did it alone, people didn't think it was gay.  I've got to do it.  Why would I speculate?  Go ahead, sorry.  It's gay for every man with a boner and funny for every man who's laughing.  Right.  Okay.  Gay or funny is in the dick end.  Instant feedback is saying gay, always gay. 
[02:42:30]  Got a lot of people coming back with a gay verdict.  Gay and Borat, it was funny.  But this was before Borat.  It doesn't matter, but I'm saying that's an example of it.  See, the problem is, though, it's like this whole gay or funny thing,  and most of these things are done to try to be funny, but they come across gay.  True.  True.  Now, you've got to kind of deal with that part of it.  I'm not talking like these guys are actually gay guys.  It's just that they try to do something.  It's coming off as gay.  Here's the difference.  Two guys wrestling, like in Borat, naked, in front of a bunch of whatever it was, 
[02:43:00]  home equity group people.  Convention people.  Beyond funny.  Hilarious.  Two guys nude wrestling in front of all their friends are just saying,  please just let us be gay.  We want to announce this.  Please tell us we're gay, because we can't tell ourselves.  Please pull us aside after this.  You know you're gay, right?  The hell of a way to come out of the closet.  Yeah, we might as well do this in front of everybody at a party.  It's Will in Miami.  Will, what's up?  Hey, boys. 
[02:43:30]  Louie, sweet tip.  How are you?  Thank you.  Thank you.  I got a gay or funny for you.  We know.  Did I lose you?  No.  Let's go.  Oh, my God.  You have horrible timing.  Here we go.  Yeah.  All right.  At 14 years old, my buddy and I used to have what we called jizz races, and it would take  place in his bedroom, and we would throw a sheet of newspaper down, each stand there  with a copy of our favorite reading material, and whoever won the jizz race got a dollar. 
[02:44:00]  Dear funny.  Okay.  It's just boring, and you should kill yourself.  Wait a minute.  Pope, you should go back in time and kill your 14-year-old self.  I want us to have...  I resent every day you've lived since then.  Thank you.  Jizz races on the Opie and Anthony show.  Jizz races.  We should have a jizz race on the Opie and Anthony show for a real prize.  The jizz.  Jizz race.  Yes, the real prize is you.  How is it going to be judged?  Wait, I got lost somewhere. 
[02:44:30]  What happened?  They jerk off, and whoever comes first wins.  I mean, in overall life, whoever comes first loses.  Right.  But I say we have jizz races on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  Jizz race.  Who would judge?  Whoever...  Anyone with eyes.  Oh, it's a timing thing.  It's weird.  And you see something...  Well, that's pretty much the winner.  What if it's like a photo finish, though?  Well, you're going to need somebody that's going to have to watch.  Put a video camera.  Put a fucking Fellini with his camera, and let him get down there and fucking film all  of it.  It'll look like the tartar sauce for your fish sticks, you little infant food-eating fuck. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, all right.  Well, I guess it's time to ask Sam what he ate last night.  Sam?  All right, intern.  We're done with you.  Yeah.  You weren't willing to admit too much, so we got to move on.  Yeah.  All right.  The other guy...  When you're ready to admit, raise your hand.  We'll bring you back in.  That Noah guy is weird.  He kind of had this smirk.  Like, you don't even know how many dicks I have.  Oh, fuck you.  I'm not fessing up.  Cut off and thrown in the garbage.  Sam, what did you have for dinner last night?  Cereal dick sucker cutter. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  Sorry.  I had two different kinds of chicken fingers.  Two different kinds?  You mean from two different places?  Well, no.  They're both from the...  Well, yeah.  One from the freezer.  One from the fridge.  To help Louie out, we learned that Sam eats like an eight-year-old.  Yeah.  No joke.  He will not eat like food...  Adult food.  Right.  He eats like an eight-year-old.  And mozzarella sticks.  Wait.  What were the two different kinds of chicken?  Oh.  It was...  One was in the fridge because it was from the last time I went to my mom's house and those  were left over. 
[02:46:00]  And the other was in the freezer.  Those were regular.  You put them in the oven and defrost them.  And eventually...  So you went to see your mom and she sent you home with some chicken fingers?  Well, yeah.  I didn't eat them all.  So she said, take these with you.  Yeah.  What else with the chicken fingers?  Eat them later.  Um, and some Triscuits.  And milk.  And milk.  And of course, the big glass of milk.  Milk, Triscuits, and chicken.  That's what my dog eats.  And mozzarella sticks.  And mozzarella sticks. 
[02:46:30]  Any dessert last night?  Um, yes.  I had some coconut ice cream.  You have the shittiest fucking snacks.  Pregnant with a kid?  Or coconut ice cream?  You know what pisses us off?  He eats like that.  Doesn't gain a pound, this kid.  I know.  And his feet are way too wide because of his bad arches.  He eats fucking orthotics.  Mad Magazine feet really bother me.  What'd you have?  A tartar sauce, Illio's pizza, and fucking awful treats.  Bazooka Joe bubblegum?  Yes. 
[02:47:00]  And some strawberry marmalade.  All right.  But I ate it out of the asshole of a small animal.  It's the fucking worst snacks.  All right.  Hey, Louis C.K.  He's got his DVD coming out Tuesday from his HBO special.  Make sure you pick that up.  Please.  Louis, what'd you think of the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show?  Oh, that was great.  I had a great time.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  You did Vegas with us?  No, I didn't.  This is my first time.  Oh, so that was the first.  I wasn't sure.  Okay.  It was the first time I did it with you.  I had the flu in Vegas.  Yes.  I don't even remember being there.  Oh, I had a great time.  Yeah, I had a good time.  What weird happened when I was on stage, all right, some guy, I mean, all I heard was just 
[02:47:30]  cheering all of a sudden in one section in the middle of a sentence, one section far  away from me started to cheer.  You know, that's not for you.  And I didn't know, and I was like, yeah.  I'm like, no.  Okay, so what happened?  And nobody, of course, could just answer, well, see what happened was, you know.  Yeah.  So it was just, and then there was a noise, because somebody, there was like some sound  that leaked out.  Yeah, they were queuing up something.  Yeah.  Your mic cut out.  So I thought that somebody's behind me on the screen fucking around with me or something, 
[02:48:00]  and that's why they cheered at an image behind me, and then the sound.  That's what I thought was going on.  Oh, my God.  If anyone would do that, they would be shocked.  I was like, would these guys fuck with me like this?  Who would do, like, yeah, who would do that to a comic who's in the middle of his shit,  and you just get up there and...  So I tried to do my set looking at the screen in case it happened again, and then I ended  up finishing.  But the crowd was so great, they hung with me, and it ended up great.  Thanks for the idea, though.  Yeah.  Let's do that.  Let's sabotage somebody. 
[02:48:30]  Look around with other people.  I bet.  No, but apparently, I found out somebody sent me a MySpace saying that they were in the section,  and they said that there was a guy who was so blitz drunk, because they didn't serve booze  at the event, I guess, so people got really loaded before.  They had to get, like, three hours worth of hammered.  Yeah, when people think they need to pre-drink, they overdo it.  So he was so drunk, and the security threw him out, so the cheering was this guy being  thrown out, and apparently he tried to swim back to the, because Jones Beach is surrounded  by water.  Yeah.  He tried to swim back into the event. 
[02:49:00]  Swim back to the venue.  Yeah.  That doesn't say a lot for our event.  Man.  It's just one guy.  No, the good news is that they cheered a guy being thrown out.  That means the crowd was good.  Yep.  The crowd was amazing.  No, I had a ball.  We get great crowds at these shows, which we're very happy about.  The next stop, you're doing Mohegan Sun with us?  Yep.  That's a week from, what are we, nine days out?  Ten days out?  A week from Saturday.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  Mohegan Sun's the next stop.  Psych for that one.  Oh, yeah, we are.  I hate doing the casinos, and I love them. 
[02:49:30]  We're going early.  We're going to broadcast from The Wolf, one of our affiliates.  I never go home with any money.  Yeah.  I lose all my money that I make.  I lose everything.  Go to Virus Tour.  One word on MySpace for all your info on the tour dates, okay?  Right.  Yeah, no, I was really happy.  The crowd was good.  They said they listened.  I mean, they're excited.  Yep.  Usually crowds that are really pumped to be somewhere are not good comedy listeners,  but these folks are really good.  And you were late in the show, too.  Yeah, I was right after.  You know that they laughed all the way to the end, and it was three and a half hours? 
[02:50:00]  Do you realize that was a three and a half hour show?  That's hard.  Dillon Knight?  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah.  It's good.  So, we look forward to Mohegan Sun, the next stop.  A couple...  Well, you want to take a break, or you want to do more gay or funny?  I don't even want gay or funny.  I want to hear something honest out of one of these motherfuckers.  Yeah.  It's amazing to me how people will not admit shit.  But people aren't as honest as you, Jimmy.  That's what's amazing about you.  That's what makes you special.  No, but it's not even special.  It's just stuff that everybody should...  It's amazing to me how people won't... 
[02:50:30]  No, not...  I'm not talking about it yesterday.  There's no way a child with a dick doesn't put that dick in a mouth, ass, or against the  dick of another child.  Or in the hair of...  Or something.  There's just no way.  All right, let's go with this one.  We got a couple of these.  While they're asking the interns if anyone's brave enough to step up...  Yeah, right.  All right.  Big J, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Welcome back.  What's the show?  Yeah.  I got a good one for gay or funny.  Yeah.  This guy I used to play baseball with in high school. 
[02:51:00]  He would pick on the underclassmen, like in the locker room before practice.  He'd catch them whenever they were bent over, putting on their pants.  He'd run by and stick a finger in their ass and call an oil check.  And yell a what?  Oil check.  Oil check.  Oil check?  Gay.  Oil check.  I like your voice, too.  I vote gay.  Gay.  That's gay.  I mean, the guy was a fucking psycho, but...  All that football stuff is gay.  I wanted to...  I was a big kid.  I wanted to play football in high school, and I had a friend that was a year ahead of 
[02:51:30]  me, and he said, well, you have to jack off in front of everybody in the shower.  Ah.  Everybody jacks off on you.  They take...  They close your asshole with duct tape, and everybody slaps your dick.  No, this is what our...  Lewis, the high school football locker room was like, and I was like, well, I'm not playing  football because I'm not gay.  It's the gay...  Yeah.  Football camp and the football teams...  He's not exaggerating because we had that story on Long Island with the pine cones.  Oh, the pine cones.  That's all these guys do.  No, this is what America is built on, and then they go, like, George Bush and the Skull 
[02:52:00]  and Bones.  Right.  You know that just means guys are fucking each other up the ass.  Like, guys, the future presidents fucking each other up the ass.  And then they go to Abu Ghraib and stick their dicks in Iraqi people's faces.  Like, this is what fucking, like, macho, powerful people do.  Yeah.  That's the ultimate assertion of American power is sticking your dick in someone's face,  or vice versa.  That's the weird thing about an Abu Ghraib, like, somebody with a dick in their hand,  like, hey, look what I got. 
[02:52:30]  Look how I'm fucking this guy over.  I got a dick here.  The enemy.  I'm making him piss in my face.  What a loser he is.  I, uh...  This is weird.  I pledged a fraternity, and yeah.  That's what, yeah.  A lot of naked stuff, but didn't have to be hard naked, thank God.  Right.  None of that crap, but still, it's naked stuff.  You ought to pick up marshmallows with your ass cheeks and dump them on a replica of  a competing fraternity house.  That's what he did.  It was, yeah, yeah.  Pilot to Bombadier.  It was called, you know, Bomb the Fraternity House. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We did do that.  And then we did have to scare funny.  And then we had, we were blindfolded, and we had to go into, uh, uh, toilets and squish  the, uh, the turds that some, uh, sorority pig left behind from a party.  But they were bananas.  This isn't getting...  You know what, though?  I, uh...  You hope they were bananas.  Well, most of them were bananas.  You remember them.  I remember them as bananas that Charlie put in the toilet.  Here's the deal.  Like, like, mash...  They're showing dogs sniffing each other's asses on the news, by the way. 
[02:53:30]  Wait, here's...  Like, at the end of mash, it was a chicken.  It was a chicken.  No.  They weren't bananas.  They were dicks.  Here's the deal with the banana thing, though.  I, to this day, am chicken.  I, to this day, believe that I did squish a banana.  Yeah.  But then when you're in the house, and now you have to do this to other people, things  happen because maybe you don't like a pledge too much.  Right.  So, I'm sorry.  I'm so distracted by that.  They are just showing a big dog licking a little dog's asshole on TV. 
[02:54:00]  Hey, they're doing a cute animal story with two dogs.  And they're ignoring that the dogs are felching each other.  Yeah, no one's...  The big dog is just licking the nutsack of the little dog.  Yeah.  Much to the little dog's pleasure.  Where is the little dog?  It's in front of the big dog.  It's just going to start humping it.  He's the one holding it.  Yeah, they finally cut to it too.  No one...  Oh, here comes another dog now.  Let me just get my nose up this dog's asshole.  They're not showing it?  No.  Here it is.  The little dog's getting his ass licked. 
[02:54:30]  He's blowing him and nobody...  And the other one wants to get in there.  This is the morning show.  It's just fucking bestiality going on.  That one guy looks nervous.  Nobody else cares.  Uh-oh, the white dog's in a hump position.  Oh, totally.  It looks like he's ready to...  This is what they do.  Yeah, he's getting ready.  There you go.  Give mommy kisses.  You smell like dachshund ass.  There he goes.  He was fucking...  He was blowing him.  Yep.  And they don't acknowledge it.  They don't go, hey, look at that dog sucking the other dog's dick. 
[02:55:00]  He goes, so where can we get dogs like this?  Hilarious.  This isn't gay because it doesn't include another man, but when I was a kid, we lived  in a two-family house, and there was these nurses that lived together above us, and I  was...  Sexy.  Fuck, and I didn't care what they looked like.  I just...  And I used to...  Our basements were connected, so I would stay home from school, pretending I was sick, and  I would go down to the basement and climb...  I'd go into their apartment. 
[02:55:30]  Wow.  And I would find their...  Ballsy.  I'd jack off in their underwear.  Wow.  And then I'd go back downstairs and feel horrible about myself.  Make your getaway.  Yes.  Feeling all guilty about what you left...  Did you take the underwear with you?  No, no, I left it there.  You left jizzed underwear?  Yes.  What an anti-social little douchebag.  These women...  It's not like they lived with a guy.  What the fuck did they do last night?  What the fuck did I do last night?  I had jizzed in my underwear.  And they knew it was you because they'd find a load of some smarty wrappers. 
[02:56:00]  Well, could it have been with the boy dunce?  And some baseball cards.  Oh, my God.  Why is this Red Sox penny?  Yeah, a fucking Fred Lynn card with a load of half sprayed on it.  Let's go to Jamie in Cleveland.  Jamie.  Somebody put cum and I'll crawl your striker figurine in my sock drawer.  Who could it be?  Go ahead, Jamie.  Yeah, I had a couple fraternity buddies in college that would have a contest. 
[02:56:30]  They would go around the house and try to jerk off in other guys' rooms.  And so people started catching on to this and they would start locking their doors.  But these guys would climb through the windows, like get a ladder, go up to the second floor  and climb through the window just to jerk off in these people's rooms.  And they just signed like point systems to that.  Is that gay or funny?  That's funny.  Point systems.  No, it's even funnier.  I think it's both.  No, it's even funnier.  There are women listening to us right now that really believe that we take our sperm seriously. 
[02:57:00]  We'll pretty much leave it anywhere.  We just fling that shit right in Jodie Foster's face.  We don't care where to go.  We have more respect for snot.  At least we'll do that into a tissue and make sure we throw it away.  Sperm though?  No.  Like a paper boy just flinging it over your shoulder and on every door.  Women don't get it.  Riding behind a bike, jizzing on everybody's doorstep.  Women think guys take that part of us seriously. 
[02:57:30]  Our sacred seed.  Yeah, there it goes.  Ladies, if you're not available, your fucking underwear while you're working will do.  You're replaced by the thing that covers your period box.  That's so true though.  Your cloth that legs go through and shitty asshole gets rubbed on is as good as you are.  No disrespect.  You are one line in a long list of places where jizz can go.  Exactly.  You're just the most irritating.  In a cunt is like number 32 on the list of a thousand. 
[02:58:00]  That's right.  It's after hand and before face of invalid.  I showed my penis to a retarded girl when I was nine.  There was a family of like...  It's nice. 
[02:58:30]  People that look like...  Retarded people?  Yeah, it was like the...  I forget their names, but they all had Down Syndrome.  Like all these...  The Nagels?  Even the father looks at it.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Oh, is that evil?  Who is it?  I don't know.  It's Eric Nagel sitting right over there.  See, if he would have done the butt rub, we would have left him alone.  Oh, but Nagel...  That is so wrong.  No, but I was behind a CVS. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Looking for something.  And there was Gina, whatever her name was.  And I just said, can I show you my dink?  And she said, okay.  Sure.  I just took it out and let her see it.  Wow.  I used to show my ass to this girl, and she used to show me hers.  Like, I didn't know anything about the front end.  Yeah.  Like, I was initially, I guess, christened an ass man in kindergarten, because it was kindergarten.  And I'd walk up the street, and she lived like two little blocks, suburban blocks away 
[02:59:30]  around the corner.  And we used to go to the shed in the back, an old tin shed that was in the back of her  house.  And she was this blonde-haired girl.  She had a little, like, Dutch boy haircut.  And she would turn around and pull her pants down and look over her shoulder, and I would  do the same thing.  I'd pull my pants down and look over my...  And we'd both be looking at each other over our shoulders at each other's asses.  Like Hummels.  Yeah.  Like a little Norman Rockwell painting.  Like Hummels. 
[03:00:00]  Like there should be a little puppy tugging your shorts down.  Right.  Exactly.  Like, and I used to love looking at her ass.  Sure.  But I never thought of, like, you know, turn around.  Let me see the front.  Front didn't, didn't, uh...  I wasn't into the front in kindergarten.  You're an ass man.  I didn't know.  And in first grade, like, the front was definitely what it was all about.  You know, when I was a kid, my friend and his sister used to always piss their pants.  So what I would do is get either one or the other one.  I'd lay on the dirt behind shrubs and have them sit on my face so I could smell the piss 
[03:00:30]  through their underpants.  That makes complete sense with you.  Sure.  Like, that is so...  And how old were you?  Again, it all happened before fourth grade.  So I would say second grade.  I showed my penis to a crazy old man in my hometown.  What happened?  Why?  It was Schneider from one day at a time.  You're just bored?  What was it?  I gave one of his cigarettes rolled up in his sleeve.  Show him his dick.  I grew up in Newton and there was, in Massachusetts, and there was a guy, they called him Florida 
[03:01:00]  Steve.  And he was a little...  We had crazy John.  Florida Steve.  Yeah.  I'm from the Everglades.  Hello.  Hello, Florida Steve.  And this weird little old man.  And he'd come up to you, like if you were in a park or in the street.  Hey, how are you?  And he'd ask you about Florida.  He'd just steer the conversation.  Ah.  It's hot.  But it's hot in Florida right now.  And you'd go, yeah, it's hot in Florida.  He goes, what are the girls like down there? 
[03:01:30]  And you'd tell him, like everybody in town knew how to do this.  Was he Retzel Rizzo?  You'd tell him, well, the girls, they got big tits down there.  And he'd start jerking off in his pocket.  Like, this is just what he would do.  Anyway, so I saw him.  I was by my...  You know, you're with your friends and you make fun of Florida Steve.  Of course.  Crazy old man.  And when I was alone in a park and he walked up to me.  And I took out my dick and showed it to him.  I don't know why.  Did he ask?  He just went, okay, have a nice day.  And he kind of walked away.  And I realized that I had freaked out. 
[03:02:00]  You freaked out Florida Steve.  Florida Steve.  Did he think it was the stem of a Florida tangerine?  His little red pubes?  Maybe.  Could have been.  Florida Steve is not a clear.  Let's go to Oz in Georgia.  What did you hear about dicks, you fruit?  I mean, not pussies.  Oz?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Oz?  Hey, Louie, love your stuff, man.  Get his DVD that's coming.  Hey, look.  Send me up nice.  Get his DVD that's coming Tuesday.  We've got to get his plugs in. 
[03:02:30]  Shameless.  Shameless is on DVD starting Tuesday.  HBOR is special.  All right.  Sorry, Oz.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just trying to take care of my buddy here.  It's funny, man.  When I was around 12, I went to Boy Scout camp for the first time.  Boys probably 12 to 16 years old.  You were there for a week, and they kept demerits.  And the two individuals who had the most demerits were threatened with what was called the red pecker.  And at the end of the week, they had the kangaroo court.  And what they would do is the two boys who had to do it, they would announce you. 
[03:03:00]  And then the worst one would have to actually pull down the pants of the next worst one and actually paint their pecker with a red substance.  I think it was like necurochrome or something like that.  And they did that in front of a whole group, and they were adults there, too.  This is such cop speak, he's telling this.  Yeah, yeah.  These individuals, the two individuals.  Individuals.  With a red substance.  I believe it was necurochrome or iodine.  Necurochrome.  Necurochrome.  Who are, who is the they? 
[03:03:30]  Who is the power that made this happen?  And the kids.  Was it the grown-ups or the other kids?  No, the grown-ups would watch.  It was actually the boys who had to do it.  Everybody has to go to jail.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hey, buddy, we have to track to have people who people are.  Grown-ups would watch as you guys would paint another kid's penis?  The scout leader actually eventually ended up, he was charged with molesting his daughter a couple of years later.  All right, so.  All right, well, now it all makes sense.  He doesn't need to do concurrency.  There needed to be some supervision.  Got to screw it up. 
[03:04:00]  Campsite.  All right, thanks, Oz.  We got Craig standing by.  You going to admit something?  Yeah, I'm going to admit, actually.  Hold on, after the break.  After the break.  Oh, nice tease.  I don't even mean to.  You're not making it up.  No, not at all.  All right, we got a good story from Craig, who's trying to move up the ladder here,  so he might be just making up shit.  No, you've got to be honest, man.  For us to be honest.  100%.  No, Jimmy can tell.  102%.  Jimmy can tell.  102% honesty, right?  Right.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony, Louis C.K., and, of course, Jimmy Norton.  Oh, Jimmy Norton.  Hey.  Hey. 
[03:04:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  That's loud.  That is amazing.  Isn't that weird?  That's very weird.  The car parked in front of the house you grew up in right now.  The car parked in.  We're just, like, looking at, like, Google Earth.  I got Google Earth on my BlackBerry.  Yeah.  He gave me the address to where he grew up, and, what, 30 seconds later?  And there.  I got an aerial photograph of that house that he grew up in.  There it is. 
[03:05:00]  You know, and obviously, but it's just this little handheld device.  Years ago, that was inconceivable.  Growing up as a kid, that was science fucking fiction right there.  And now it's just, everyone takes it for granted and just kind of, wow, that's kind  of cool, but unless you look back at what you had back then, the inventions aren't as  amazing, because you kind of gradually get used to these things.  Yeah.  But we're in this time where technology is just spitting out some unbelievable shit.  But all the technology is just information technology. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, it is.  It used to be like, here's a thing that can wash your clothes.  Look at that, it slices, it dices, it's Julianne's fries.  Here's a car with a smooth ride, or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's like, now you can see this, now you can see this girl's asshole, now you  can, it's all information, which all means porn.  It's all major information.  I was saying, I was on one of the video sites last night, just two hours, two hours going  through, and I realized you could just go through. 
[03:06:00]  You can see Break.com over here.  I was watching hysterical, no, not just Break.com, I was going on a lot of, yes, Break.com.  But like two hours of just going through things where you're watching maybe 50 seconds of  something really funny happening, and then a minute and a half of Iraqis just being pulverized  by machine gun fire, and then something else that's interesting, a little bit of history,  this, you're just getting these blurbs of information just shooting at your head. 
[03:06:30]  Well, it's nice.  Like little Alex sitting there with his eyes open, you know, it's Beethoven playing.  It's nice to know you can program, it's nice that you can program your own viewing experience  now, finally.  Yeah, but is that good?  The younger people out there don't understand.  We had to watch the shit they threw on TV for us, and now with the DVRs and everything  else, and now with YouTube and Break.com, you can decide your whole viewing schedule.  We didn't even have V-Schedule.  We didn't have V-Schedule.  No.  No.  You had to see what's on TV.  What's on.  What's on.  What's on.  The three networks. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  And then there was Fox, and that was weird.  Two, four, five, seven, sometimes eight from Connecticut, and then whatever UHF channels  you got.  Yeah.  I want to go to the phones because I don't want to lose her.  It's Jennifer from Washington.  Jennifer.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  What's up, Jennifer?  Shitty name.  Not much.  Anthony does not like your name.  Why?  I hate your name because I have to write it every three months.  On a check?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  She's still using your last name, too, right?  Nah, please. 
[03:07:30]  All right.  I'd love to get into it, but pending litigation keeps me from making any comments I would love  to make.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, sweetie.  I'm just trying to help you out a little bit.  Let's get some of that anger out that you're a happy person.  Well, you'd be worthy if you did.  Now, if I did write checks.  Let me ask Charlie.  But I don't.  Charlie writes the checks.  Charlie.  Charlie wrote a check.  He saw the amount on it and said, oh, my God, OJ.  All right.  Look, this guy has chest hair that forms into a bikini top on TV. 
[03:08:00]  He didn't even else see that.  Wow.  That was bizarre.  Yeah, Jennifer.  It looked like a black bikini top.  Jennifer.  Hi.  What's up, Jennifer?  I wonder.  Not much.  All right.  Nice.  And you've called the show for?  Well, I was calling because I actually had a gay experience when I was younger, too.  How old are you now?  All right.  How old am I now?  I'm 24.  All right.  Because you sound like you're 14.  I know.  Sorry.  Oops.  Sorry.  That was mine.  Lawyer warning you? 
[03:08:30]  No.  No.  You all right?  Shut up.  I know.  I know you want to, but trust me on this.  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Jennifer.  Well, when I was in third grade, my best friend and I liked the same boy.  Yeah.  But we didn't really, we couldn't admit to each other that we liked boys yet because they  were dirty and they had cooties and stuff.  So we were playing in her basement and she had the idea that we could take turns being  the boy and we would like act out what we wanted to do with that.  Oh. 
[03:09:00]  Wait, you would take turns being the boy?  Yes, because she said the boy had to be on top and she knew where the boy was supposed  to put his head.  Wow.  How did she get her info?  How did she know all this at such a young, tender age?  Well, not to ruin it, but I'm pretty sure retrospectively that she was molested.  Oh, jeez.  Well, that's not good for her.  Good for you.  That's an excellent source of information.  Molesting is a very educational.  You might as well learn from the people closest to you.  Oh.  I don't know if that dump button works here.  I would have dumped that out.  Which one? 
[03:09:30]  Me?  Yeah.  Really?  I think the whole road right there was a little too graphic.  All right.  Let's keep it clean.  Keep it clean.  Not clean.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  Fuck the clean.  Keep it fair.  So did she stimulate a penis with anything or did she just bump her?  Slit against your...  Yeah, she would use her hand.  Oh, she put her hand down there.  Was she putting the thumb out straight?  And she would tell me how to put my hand when it was my...  Yeah, she really was quite the director.  Wow.  But, um...  Wow.  Yeah, and so she...  She had to put one hand on, you know, the boob and one had to be the penis. 
[03:10:00]  And, um, yeah.  How old were you, though?  I was in third grade.  I'm not sure how old that makes you.  I guess 10.  I didn't realize that a video of this would be worth billions of dollars.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right, Jennifer.  We're gonna...  We're gonna be responsible and we're gonna move on because this is getting dangerous, man.  Thank you, Jennifer.  Very much.  Anything, uh, since you've been of age?  Oh, I'm...  She's gone.  I was gonna say anything since she's been of age.  Yes.  Has she relived the experience?  All right.  Hmm. 
[03:10:30]  Well, now we got, uh...  That's strange.  Craig.  Him back there.  What's up?  We've been waiting for the break, so you want to admit to a few things?  Yeah, a couple of things.  Well, I would like to share.  All right.  First, when I was...  I don't remember what age, but it was before I can ejaculate.  Mind if I jerk off while I tell this?  Thank you.  By the way, a lot of people...  A couple of people saying that girl that we just had on was the same one that had sex on  the phone with her ex and called her boyfriend about two to three months ago.  Wow, really?  She's the quintessential good egg.  Remember her? 
[03:11:00]  If that was her, have her call back.  Jennifer, call back.  Maybe she just made some...  No, she didn't make up that other story.  No.  That was just real...  All right.  Anyway, go ahead, Craig.  Sorry.  Yeah, what happened?  This was before I could ejaculate, and obviously I would sleep over my friend's house, and his  bed was against the wall, and he'd set up a cot for me to sleep on, which was literally  right next to him.  What a fella.  Oh, boy.  So we woke up one morning, and we were discussing our boners. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  A little boner talk.  You were discussing them.  Well, as like, hey, look, I have a boner.  Oh, so do I.  That's a discussion.  Mine's bigger.  No.  Your mind's bigger.  That kind of discussion.  Sounds like there was some...  Disgusting.  He made it sound so responsible.  We were discussing our boners.  Disgusting the boners.  We were discussing the Middle East, naked with boners.  Yes.  As men of similar ilk would discuss a financial strategy.  Having an interlocular...  What do you call it?  Inter...  I can't say.  Interlocular. 
[03:12:00]  Interlocular discussion of the boner.  Of one another's erections.  Well, we were talking about it, and he was like, look at mine.  So I looked at his, and then I raised my blanket, and he looked at mine.  Then he takes his hand and pushes my penis towards...  Now we're in the present tense.  This is interesting.  Ah, now.  Then he takes his hand.  Wait, he takes his hand and he points your penis?  No, no.  He took my penis and pushed it towards my balls. 
[03:12:30]  Ow.  Well, not like bent it.  Oh.  Like what, you were going to fire a flaming cannonball over the fucking wall to the fort?  That's exactly what he did.  And he released, and then he just watched my penis fucking fly back and forth like one  of those clowns that you put in the face.  Do the reason why the boing sound is made for the boner.  Exactly.  That's right.  The boing kind of vibrate.  Then I did it to him, and we constantly just did that, and then he ended up like...  Constantly.  Yeah, about like ten times each.  Ten times. 
[03:13:00]  Going back and forth.  Like, you would reach over, it's probably like watching two guys play speed chess.  With no board.  It's like back and forth.  Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.  So we did that a couple of times.  This isn't going to end good.  Well, that's basically, that's one story.  What finally happened?  Wait a minute, so how did that end?  Then you just...  It just...  You did that ten times and then said, hey, you want to get something to eat?  Yeah, just like, who came on whose chest?  Well, this was before I can ejaculate.  Oh, okay, that's the... 
[03:13:30]  Okay, that's...  This is like the Clinton didn't inhale thing.  Right.  Right.  Right.  So you both just kind of pushed each other's dicks a little bit, and then said, let's get  cheese fries.  Pushed each other's dicks around.  Yeah, then we went downstairs and ate breakfast.  Right.  What'd you have, Froot Loops?  That's so cheap and perfect.  That's so...  And there was another time later on when I could ejaculate.  How much later?  I'd say about...  A week?  13.  Which was like, this was like at the peak of my masturbating. 
[03:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we would...  You peaked at 13?  Wow.  Well, no, it was like constant every day, every second.  Sure.  So, we had another sleepover, and there was another friend involved, and we actually did  the whole jerking off marathon to a porno that we got in touch with.  All right, so you and the friend, you and the dick pusher, and another friend.  Another one.  How'd you have this other one into your dick?  It's true that when you first start jerking off, it's constant every... 
[03:14:30]  It's like the Big Bang.  It really just fades until you're dead.  Like, your whole life is just building up to the first come, and then you come, come,  come, come, come for like a year.  Right.  And then you come, come, come, come, and then you die.  That's really...  But we were in my same friend's house as before, and we all just like lined up, and we all did  the whole sock thing.  Sock thing?  Yeah, you can't...  Jerked off into a sock.  We weren't fully exposed.  Everybody knew.  But how did you say that? 
[03:15:00]  Like, who said let's all...  Yeah, yeah, that's gotta be brought up by somebody.  You don't just do that.  The other friend that we involved in this...  This is not like some board game available, like Scruples.  Yeah.  And now...  Oh, it says jerk off.  Jerk off in a sock.  It's like Yahtzee.  If you roll two sixes, you blow your pal.  The other friend that we involved, he ended up getting his hands on one of his dad's pornos.  So...  Ah.  He brought it over, and we ended up just all jerking off to it.  Into a sock. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, into a sock.  That's such a brave step to go from watching a porno with your buddies, and then someone  has to go, ah, what the hell?  I'm just gonna start jacking.  And expose themselves.  Now, did you take your socks off of your feet?  So everybody was like, one sock, one shirt.  Where did the sock come from?  The house that I stayed at, I got one of his clean socks, and I jerked off into his.  You know what it was?  It was their friend, his friend Ted, and his father was also Ted Sr., the owner of Ted's  Sock Emporium.  They specialized in crew.  Tube.  The first time I saw a porno, I was at my friend Raj's house. 
[03:16:00]  I love it.  He was going to use his real name.  An Indian dude.  And his dad had a porno.  It was one of those old top-load VCRs called The Fur Trap.  I was like 13 or whatever.  The Fur Trap.  Yeah.  And we were watching it.  That can't be good at all.  We were sitting on the floor of his dad's bedroom, and we were watching it, and I didn't know how  it was going to affect me.  It turned me on.  It changed my life.  I went in his parents' bathroom.  But I couldn't do it in front of him.  I just, I laid on the bathroom floor in his parents' bathroom and jerked off all over 
[03:16:30]  my, it was obscene.  Obscene.  A bath mat.  You have to use that word.  A bath mat that his Indian parents would step on, and their feet after a shower, and came  on myself while he watched The Fur Trap in the other room.  My head was on tiles.  My fucking, my fucking Lenny Bruce at the end.  The outside of my thigh was touching the cool porcelain base of the toilet.  Sure it was.  So how do you bring up?  You see, again, it's like OJ's description.  Like, those are the things you remember.  Yeah.  How do you, how do you bring it up in front of people? 
[03:17:00]  Like, let's do this.  Like, I had to sneak into the other room.  That's the point I'm making.  Right.  I don't exactly, I remember jerking off to this video, and I remember my, my two of  my friends jerking off.  I don't know how it was brought up, but it had to have been just like one of us started  jerking off, and it's like, hey, all right, let's all jerk off.  Not, not exposed totally.  Like, one of my friends was under a blanket, I had the sock, and my other friend in a sock.  Were the lights out?  The only light was the TV flashing?  That's exactly what it was.  A little blue light.  We gotta get some chicks to call a show, man. 
[03:17:30]  Let's get a little, a little.  A little Manny.  Oh, he's not.  A little dizzy.  You want more gay?  Yeah, what's another one?  Wow.  Jesus.  He really wants to purge this one.  No, no, this kid's got like a Dewey Decimal System.  Yeah, fast forward.  This is like that.  Fast forward to one o'clock, and then there was the time.  Man, I remember.  We're sleeping.  They bring in some murderer for a traffic ticket, and he just, they give him a burger and  a shake, and he just tells them about that.  Spills his guts.  He's going.  He's going.  He's going.  He's going.  He's going.  He's going.  He's going.  You're a killer.  All right, let's, why don't you end with your stairway to heaven?  All right, one more story. 
[03:18:00]  Let's go.  Here's the biggie.  We got our lighters out.  Let's go.  It's when I first started going to camp, and one night when all the counselors were out  getting drunk, one of my friends and I sat on each other's, we sat on his bed, and  he ended up just touching me and just started jerking me off.  Wow.  Until I came.  And then.  Until I came.  Wow.  These are no longer gay confessions of weird things.  This is just a man who's gay telling us things that gay men do. 
[03:18:30]  Like his little gay sex stories.  Are you gay?  It's okay if you are.  No, I'm not gay.  I'm totally.  Oh, wow.  Totally.  I even, like, this was.  Minus the jacking.  All right.  I'm going, well, I don't know if totally would be in that description.  Yeah, totally is.  So he jacked you off.  You could say not gay, but the totally thing is.  You're sitting there with a person.  You're not gay.  You're sitting there with your buddy, and he just took a risk and grabbed your dick  and tugged it until goo shot out of it.  Yeah.  That's basically what it is, because at the time, it's the girls weren't going to do it. 
[03:19:00]  Right, so.  Ah, wow, yeah, yeah.  So him being a pal ended up just jerking me off.  So what was in it for him?  He got a hand job, too.  From who?  From me.  All right.  That's where we were going.  At this point, we got to get rid of the totally part.  Somebody jerked him off.  Who?  It must have been me.  Ah, it was me.  I guess it was me.  Yeah, what did you just look down?  It's like the fucking, the hand in fucking evil dead, too.  That's amazing.  That's amazing that without questioning, that story is, this guy jerked me off. 
[03:19:30]  Right.  Ask him two more questions.  And he's jerking.  We jerked each other off.  It was a mutual jerking.  So you guys are doing it at the same time?  Not at the same time.  He did me.  Then I did him.  Oh, you came in and then I did it.  You fell for that, gay.  Wow.  At least he was doing it to get a load off.  Right.  You had your load off.  You just felt like, well, I can't be a cheapskate about it.  Right.  At the time, I wasn't thinking of all that, you know.  No.  You're just being gay.  Yeah, I was just being gay.  Were you trying to do a good job to get it over with as quickly as possible? 
[03:20:00]  I was going as fast.  He believes in even Steven.  Yes, he does.  You're an even Steven.  Have you ever had your dick in another man's mouth?  No.  No, but that same friend, we talked about it.  You decided to do it?  No.  And then did it?  No, we didn't do it, but it was to the point where it's like, but I don't want your cum  in my mouth.  Oh, right.  You worked it out logistically.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That one.  How did that come up?  Who said, I don't want you?  How did that pop up?  He brought it up after.  He was like, hey, what about this?  And I'm like, I don't want to do it.  And he's like, I'm like, do you mind? 
[03:20:30]  And he's like, but I don't want your cum in my mouth.  All right.  The guy was working on a deal.  Negotiating, yeah.  Well, you know, look, I'll stop for a minute, but none of that.  So what happened?  He blew you and you said you wouldn't do it.  No, he didn't blow me.  He didn't blow me at all.  I would have been so gay.  That fell apart in the talks.  Yeah.  They had talks about it, but.  It was like fucking Hamas.  Yeah, yeah, there you go.  The togs.  The togs.  How many times did you guys do this?  Just once.  Just that one night.  And ever since then, I haven't touched a cock. 
[03:21:00]  All right.  We got to get the gay out.  Wow.  The women have started calling.  That is so.  That's pretty good.  Let's go ahead.  Gay.  Yeah.  Thank you, Craig.  Oh, you're welcome.  That's pretty good.  Thanks.  Go ahead, man.  You look a lot like our ex-producer if he was a little fatter.  It just hit me.  Do you just wash your hands all the time now, too?  What?  Yeah, constantly, actually.  And cum.  Just watch your hands.  Yeah.  He looks like Rick, right?  A little bit.  A little Rick. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  And you got the hat on, especially.  Not bad.  All right.  Pretty good honesty there.  Hootie McBoob from Pal Talk.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Ah.  Hootie.  Hello?  Yes.  Hi, Hootie.  You are on the airwaves.  Really quick.  It was last year.  I had a party at my house.  And a whole bunch of my friends came over.  But then a whole bunch of them left.  And there were five guys left and me and one other girl.  And it just kind of randomly started.  She got naked.  I got naked. 
[03:22:00]  And I had gone down on her.  And then she went down on me.  And the guys were just standing around watching us naked.  And then they end up.  One guy ended up jacking off on her boobs.  And I'd never want to do that again.  I didn't really enjoy going down on her.  So.  But.  It was very overwhelming.  Did anyone jack off on you?  No.  No?  No.  Why not?  I don't know.  Why not?  My husband was there.  So it was like.  Oh.  Well.  Yeah.  My husband and I are swingers.  So anybody that's listening right now is going like, 
[03:22:30]  what the hell is me on the radio for them?  I see.  Yeah.  It's just a story.  A little story about the home.  We want the innocent ones from the old days.  We want cringy.  Yeah.  Let's go to John in Mississippi.  John.  Hey.  Hey.  I got to nominate Craig's last story for hottest story ever.  Why?  They're doing such a fucking rod.  Was it the negotiating that they were doing?  What's that?  Are you being serious?  Are you gay?  No. 
[03:23:00]  I'm gay.  Don't make me a bad person.  No, I'm gay.  Are you gay?  No, I'm gay.  No, it's not.  It's.  You are confused.  Men are so full of contradiction.  I thought.  Every guy has some weird gay problem.  No.  No, I'm gay.  No, I'm gay.  I'm not gay.  Did you ever blow a guy?  Well, we talked.  No, we did not blow each other.  We just talked about it, and then we blew each other.  Okay.  All right, John.  I'm glad you played that last one.  Punch it out.  All right.  There goes John.  Yeah.  Changing gears slightly. 
[03:23:30]  We got this audio that is hilarious.  Yes.  The mom freaking out at a hockey game.  This is the greatest thing ever.  Love this.  She's being a little too serious at her son's hockey game.  Yeah.  When her son and some other boy on the ice get into a fight.  A little bit of a scuffle happens in hockey.  This is what human beings are really like.  Yeah.  This is real human.  This is real human beings right here.  Is there a video that is audio from a video?  It's on, yeah.  Break?  Get it on break.  Should we put hockey, mom, fight, yell, curse, whatever? 
[03:24:00]  We'll give you the...  You'll find it.  She's watching a hockey game.  You can't really.  The video isn't that good.  The audio is good.  Yeah.  Her son's in the game.  Yeah.  All right.  And her son gets in a fight with some guy.  Some other player.  And she voices her displeasure with this gentleman.  There goes the hammer.  And he called in Jimmy's stick.  Hey!  Fucking asshole.  Help!  Stop!  He's fighting him!  That motherfucker!  Yeah!  Get off of him! 
[03:24:30]  You son of a bitch!  I'm making a fucking...  Yeah!  Yeah!  You motherfucker!  All right.  Where's my boyfriend?  Jimmy!  That fucking motherfucker!  You fucking piece of shit!  God, you fucking cock-sucking piece of shit!  Fuck you! 
[03:25:00]  Hold your heat, hammer.  Oh, my God.  And once again, it ends.  You know, there was more.  Yeah.  Had to be.  But, uh...  That's so good.  Isn't that great?  That's so good.  The screaming.  The just primal...  It's so weird.  Women that do that.  They just scream.  It's not because they're being hit or something.  They just...  Yeah!  I'm upset!  What the fuck is that?  It's so weird.  Fucking cocksucker!  She's wearing a windbreaker.  Just throw her out scrunchie in her hair. 
[03:25:30]  Fucking...  Watching the fucking idiot that came out of her vagina getting beaten up on the ice.  Good.  Stupid cunt.  Good.  Good Bostonian, gash-faced cunt.  I'm going to hate my hometown.  All right.  We're going to break, then we'll finish the show next.  Louis C.K., his DVD comes out Tuesday from his HBO special, Shameless.  Yes, Shameless.  Is now on DVD...  Well, will be out on DVD Tuesday.  All right.  And, uh...  I'm on Conan tomorrow. 
[03:26:00]  I just...  Oh!  Yeah, I forgot.  Wow.  A little forget.  I look at him.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  How many have you done, Conan?  You've done a lot, right?  I have a shitload.  I was the first comedian to do Conan.  I was writing on the show when they started.  You've done more than ten Conan's?  Not by a long shot, yeah.  I don't remember.  By the way, Jimmy was telling a story about sushi with Chris Rock.  Oh, yeah.  That was a great...  That was a fun night.  And we got him...  This is Alan Alda.  Yes.  Yeah, he told the whole story on the air.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, I told him.  We were so happy to do that for him.  It was like a fucking dying kid.  But then Matthew Bronson was like... 
[03:26:30]  Matthew's offering, like, what, do you want me to help you get it?  Yeah, he did.  I want to help.  He was invested in it.  He wanted it to happen, too.  My favorite part of the whole thing, though, was the Alan Alda, where Jimmy goes up and  discusses some of the language that was used on MASH and how it was, like, cutting edge  and broke barriers back then.  And Alan Alda was, like, into it and really got into the story and explaining it to Jimmy  and what it was like back then with the censorship.  And then Jimmy took it too far and had to mention another MASH episode. 
[03:27:00]  And then he realized he had lost Alan.  I love that.  I don't think it happened like you thought it did.  No, no, it did.  It was just a little bit...  Nothing major, but I sense that he went, eh.  All right, enough.  Internally, you have.  I gave you enough of my time.  Exactly.  Our moment is over.  It might have not been true.  Alan Alda's thinking, I think I might have found a new friend.  This is good.  And then, like, eh.  And Jimmy just goes, I'll walk away.  You guys hit the blood of children in a sitcom.  Oh, God.  And internally, he went, eh. 
[03:27:30]  Just fucking, eh.  Fucking let all the floor sit down.  Bleed out, you fucking chinless pig.  He hated me.  No, he told me that he listened to you guys' show because he listened to clips that I  had of me and Bill Donahue and some other stuff on my website.  Right.  And he said, those guys sound really intelligent.  They're very thoughtful.  I enjoyed it.  Wow.  Yeah, he liked your show.  God damn.  Yeah, he told me the same thing, too.  Alan Alda.  When Alan and I were chatting.  That was pretty good.  When you and Alan, we were chatting.  Every time his mouth blew us, I'm like, that's Alan Alda talking.  Yeah, it's really weird. 
[03:28:00]  It's weird.  Yes.  So when he did that, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, my chin goes very high up when I speak.  He was very nice.  He was a really good guy.  And he looks like a psychopath in the movie.  He's funny, too.  Yeah.  Cool.  We had a funny, we were having lunch and I was told him about my dad telling me about  sex because my dad explained to me how to make a woman come by teasing her.  Like, my dad gave me this sort of European, you know, the art of lovemaking.  I was like 10. 
[03:28:30]  And he said that his mom was very similarly inappropriate.  He asked his mother what sex was when he was 10.  And she said, it's wonderful, Alan, which was an awful thing to hear.  Yeah.  And then we're talking about sex and stuff.  And then he said, hey, I have to go to my trailer and jerk off now.  It was great that Hawkeye made that joke.  All right.  Let's go to break.  On the instant feedback, Adam W.  This is a good one from Columbus.  How did gay or funny just turn into that's gay as hell?  Yeah, funny went. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, really did.  Left behind a long time ago.  I'm telling you, we are going to have fucking jizz races.  Yes.  Jizz race.  Do you honestly, we could probably find five, yeah, brave souls out there.  Or you could do Dick Rorschach where you take, like I was describing, a plate, any plate of glass.  Yeah.  Smush your dick against it and people say.  And say what it looks like.  And then analyze them.  That's very funny.  The same guys we get.  How about this?  They have to jerk off in studio.  Yeah.  But they have to do it while looking at awful pictures. 
[03:29:30]  Like, how about pictures of syphilis vaginas or pictures of shit with burnt bodies.  I could be part of that.  And I would feel comfortable.  Those Jonestown bodies all laid next to each other in the 70s.  Well, that was kind of hot.  With awful, with awful, we can't touch them or like hassle them.  We can't touch them?  Jesus, did you even have to say that?  I mean, throw stuff at, you think I would want to throw something at somebody's limp cock while they're jerking off?  Wait.  How do you not?  Can we do a, can we have a lot of events like jizz high jump? 
[03:30:00]  Gotta have the jizz olympics.  Jizz olympics.  Jizz olympics.  I like it.  Jizz high jump.  Jizz olympics.  Yeah, no, you put a bar up.  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm getting at.  And then the other guy's gotta go.  Oh, this could take a while, though.  But they have to like jerk off and like we're playing like audio from the fucking dentist scene from the marathon, man.  It's like the unsexiest thing.  Or you make them, you switch like a bait and switch.  Like if we get a girl with big tits to stand there, and then right before they come, some old ladies, they have to come in a normal way.  Ah, right.  Or a big hairy ass. 
[03:30:30]  They have to come while Patty is in the room talking to them.  Something awful.  Ah, eh.  Wow, that would be good for Patty.  She's never seen action like that.  All right, ask the bosses if this is legal.  Jizz olympics.  Just jizz olympics.  Or just Jimmy's.  Jizz races.  Thanks to that caller.  Jizz racing.  By the way, your vagina has talent, I think, is going to happen finally.  Oh, thank God.  We're doing things with vaginas.  Mm-hmm.  Your vagina has talent.  Yeah, that's coming to the O.A.  Isn't it so your vagina has talent? 
[03:31:00]  So, yeah.  Because the so is very important to that.  Just the, your vagina has talent as well.  But so your vagina has talent.  Talent, yeah.  Ah, I like it better.  Can I point out the phoniest thing I've ever seen?  This is for me, Rob.  Steve, do they really want me to ask XM about this?  This is queer.  Or Steve C.  Steve C.?  Nathan Lane is more convincing talking about how hot a pussy is.  This is queer.  This seems queer to me.  I don't know.  Oh, maybe he's like, do they really want me to ask XM about this? 
[03:31:30]  And then he's signing it.  This is queer Steve C.  It's all how you look at it.  Just so you know who's talking.  Yeah.  This is queer Steve C.  Oh, this is queer Steve C.  You remove the period and the slash and it looks a little different.  We'll have approval in 15 minutes or nine days.  I'll go check.  Do you want me to ask about this or just not ask about it and assume things? 
[03:32:00]  What?  Tell Louis C.K.  We want to do So Your Vagina Has Talent.  And they had no problem with everything.  We gave them some of the things these women were going to do with their vaginas.  Right.  And then we were going to do, what is it called with the maze, with the finger?  That's the one they had the problem with.  What is it called?  Rube Goldberg.  Rube Goldberg.  Oh, a Rube Goldberg kind of contraption with the vagina involved to finger the vagina.  So it's going to be this long involved thing. 
[03:32:30]  Like you light a match and it makes a string break.  Yeah.  And then the boot kicks the bucket over and the water hits a water wheel.  And it's a cue ball that rolls down.  And at the end, a rubber finger will insert in the vagina.  Just a little poke.  And that's what they had a problem with?  Yeah.  Yeah, the insertion.  Why?  I don't know.  They're afraid it would have gone into our cunt at 200 miles an hour or something and injure her.  Yeah.  Well, they had a problem with it because they were hoping it would be a guy's ass. 
[03:33:00]  Right.  Yes.  Hello.  This is Queer Steve Z.  Where is Queer Steve Z?  That's his fucking...  If he was running for president, that would be the Secret Service's code name for him.  Queer Steve Z.  Dude, we have one guy that's brave enough.  Tony from Bethpage is on the line.  He wants to do this.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get a bunch of people.  You want to talk to him now or have a break?  Brave enough.  Gay or brave is going to be interesting.  We have to have a few guys because you're not going to be jerking off to gay things. 
[03:33:30]  That's the beauty of it.  Let's go to Tony.  Hey, what's going on all night?  Hey, Tony.  Hey, man.  Tony Baloney, what's up?  You're on the S, sir.  Hey, how's it going?  Yeah, I'm up for this.  I'll do it.  Okay.  Oh, jeez.  Why not?  He'll throw a batch out in front of a bunch of guys.  In front of a bunch of guys.  In front of a bunch of guys.  Thanks, Jimmy.  You're welcome.  Are you there?  You're breaking up, guys.  Yeah, I think the phone...  Hold on.  I'm sure he'll be happy.  You know, Stalker Patty will be there. 
[03:34:00]  So, what are you doing?  She has to read sexy things.  Yeah.  Why didn't we get Stalker Patty's review on the porn movie?  Let's get her on the phone.  That's how we'll end today's show.  What?  We'll do that next.  She watched the porno?  Well, we sent her to the peep shows.  Oh, that's right.  And we had her buy porn.  And she's supposed to give us a review.  Well, I watched it.  It was very exciting.  We'll see if she's around.  So dirty and weird.  We'll talk to her next.  The virus is spreading. 
[03:34:30]  All right.  Before we get to the line of the day,  why don't you make the musical even louder, please?  What?  Holy crap.  What?  Maybe it sounds fine over the air.  I don't know.  Yeah, it probably does.  Maybe all the processing, all the...  Equaled out.  All the equipment that this stuff goes through makes it good.  But to me, I feel like I'm being blasted out. 
[03:35:00]  Before line of the day, we're going to talk to Stalker Patty here.  Stalker Patty for her 52nd birthday.  We surprised her with a little shopping spree, Louie.  A shopping spree to the old peep shows.  Peep show.  To go to the peep show?  One of those video stores.  We dragged her in there live on the air.  She had no idea.  She really thought she was going to Macy's or some clothing store.  What did we let her pick out?  Where do they still have peep shows?  No, we found one like Danny found it.  They're being pushed to the avenues.  They're kind of off of Times Square now. 
[03:35:30]  You've got to kind of walk a couple of blocks.  I used to work in Times Square, and that was...  I actually was really grateful that Giuliani shut them down.  Yeah.  Because they were eating my life.  A lot of people are like, Giuliani, ruin New York, man.  No, thank God.  It's like Disney down there now.  You know what I'm saying?  I was taking three-hour lunches.  I was just shopping, trying to find a handjob.  Because they had real girls in there, and some of them didn't have glass in the window.  And you could get a girl to reach in and jack you off.  Hey, nice.  And I used to just go from window.  Can I get a handjob?  Nope.  Okay, next window. 
[03:36:00]  Just blatantly asking for it.  Hey, handjob, handjob.  Nope.  You're at a fucking McDonald's.  Could you leave?  Let's just cut to the chase here, all right?  All right, sorry.  But Stalker Patty, we brought her into one of these places, and she got to pick out whatever  she wanted, a little shopping spree.  That's nice.  And she brought a porn movie home, and we want her to review it.  Stalker Patty.  Hi.  Hi, Patty.  How are you today?  I'm fine.  Who gives a shit? 
[03:36:30]  So now, you went on your shopping spree.  Did you get a movie and something else, or just the movie?  I forgot.  Yes, I did.  I got Granny's Gone Wild, because I'd have something I could relate to age-wise.  And then the other thing was some kind of toy.  It had an elephant, you know, with the trunk that...  Oh, there was clitoral stimulation also.  Yeah, it was vaginal and clitoral stimulation. 
[03:37:00]  So they're tusks that...  Hopefully jam up your taint.  Just fucking hit you right in there.  Make you bleed.  Well, did it have one?  So do you...  You watched the movie?  Yes, I did watch the movie.  You did.  Now, were there men in this movie?  Well, I'm sorry.  Can you repeat that?  It's hard to hear you.  Were there men in this movie, along with the women?  Yeah, there were, like, women over 70, and there were men under 30. 
[03:37:30]  All righty.  Now, Patty, have you ever seen a dirty movie before this?  Not really.  I was expecting Red Shoe Diaries, though.  I missed that.  Dan likes that.  What?  Dan just laughs at the reference.  Because she never does a point.  She's just awful on so many levels.  She really is.  You were expecting what?  Red Shoe Diaries?  Red Shoe Diaries?  Was that on Showtime or something?  It was, like, soft porn, right?  Soft porn on...  Oh, Patty, no. 
[03:38:00]  That's all I've ever seen, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I removed a blow.  Slow touching through a foggy lens.  Let's ask Patty.  What was Red Shoe Diaries all about?  Red Shoe Diaries always had a storyline.  It involved the guy in the beginning with the dog and the letter.  He would read it and then go into the story of the breakup or the relationship, you know.  It was kind of fun and interesting.  And you really thought Granny's Gone Wild was going to be just like that? 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, I thought it had a storyline, a plot, you know.  Maybe it starts with Grandma baking cookies and then the mailman comes and then she just invites the mailman in for a cookie.  And then one thing leads to another.  That's what I was expecting, you know, that kind of thing.  Yeah, well...  You got a phone ringing, Patty.  What did you expect?  Mini Pearl to pop in and then be fucked by Yaku Kodam?  I'm on the work phone.  You're on the work phone.  Well, sorry.  Oh, never mind, never mind.  It's been answered.  There's another phone out. 
[03:39:00]  Don't worry about the job or anything.  But anyway, okay, I'm with you.  Now, Patty, you watched the movie.  You actually got to see Sex from the beginning to the end, right?  Yeah, and that's all they did.  Now, did you see...  Dirty folks on that porno tape.  What's wrong with them?  You got to see men ejaculate for the first time?  Is that the first time you've seen that?  Well, yeah, there was some of that in.  It was kind of disgusting.  I had to close my eyes a couple times because I'm not used to that. 
[03:39:30]  Once or twice you had to close the eyes, huh?  Close my eyes.  What, you're not used to seeing jizz come out?  It's disgusting.  Would you catch some of that in your mouth and make the yummy noise?  No.  But, Patty, would you be comfortable with that being in your vagina?  I don't know.  How about in your anus or between your toes?  You know, maybe.  Oh, with her corn chip toenails.  I'm still happy to be normal. 
[03:40:00]  Frito's corn chip toenails with jizz dripping off of them.  Oh.  Patty.  Yeah.  So, you closed your eyes when, what, the guy was ejaculating?  Well, when I saw that on the film, yeah, it wasn't pleasant to look at.  Now, you saw men in a state of excitement?  Yeah, and it's disturbing.  They were old enough to be their great-great-grandsons, I swear.  They were less than 25 years old, a couple of them. 
[03:40:30]  Would they tool some of these old bags up the ass?  I don't know.  You would think that they would want to go out with somebody their own age.  Go out.  It's not a fucking documentary on dating.  It's a porn movie.  These are guys who had to inject rocket fuel into their cocks to get them to budge for these old bags of meat.  You understand they were fucking cadavers?  That's practically what was going on.  Now, Patty, did you feel anything when you watched this? 
[03:41:00]  Any excitement in your lower abdomen or something?  Did you feel like...  Your breathing changed?  Yeah.  Were you feeling a little excited?  Not really, no.  I didn't feel anything.  I was like, don't just all this is.  And then I turned it off in the middle because that's all they were doing, you know.  Well, how are you going to find out what happened?  Exactly.  Who done it?  Yeah, I know what happened.  Probably from the beginning to the end, it's the same thing.  Who gave the old lady a pink sock?  Oh, my God. 
[03:41:30]  It's a fucking...  Who done it?  Patty, how much of the movie did you watch?  About three quarters of it.  I called all of you here.  First of all, they played the first eight commercials.  And they were all like, ooh.  Someone in this room came on her face.  It was Remington with his fist in the asshole in the study.  That's right.  Hey, Patty, do you usually just keep babbling when you realize no one's listening to you  and we're having a conversation?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're talking, Patty.  I'm sorry.  I can hardly hear you.  You sound far away. 
[03:42:00]  We are, Patty.  Yeah.  We're blocks and blocks away.  This is not one-on-one, face-to-face.  In all fairness, we've still got to fix the phones.  If we're going to have this set up for the next month, let's get everything right.  Yeah, the phones aren't going out loud enough.  Patty, I heard...  Through, you know, you stomping on everyone's great lines there.  That there were, what, commercials before the movie started?  Yes.  What were they for?  Now you're going to shut up?  What were the commercials for, Patty?  One of them was like dating service, escort services, and this and that. 
[03:42:30]  You know, phone services where you call in and hear a live lady on the phone.  The same eight or nine commercials.  A live lady.  And then it went into the production, whatever, the page, and then it went back into the same  eight or nine commercials.  Ah.  Yeah.  And what was your favorite part of the movie?  What the hell was that? 
[03:43:00]  I was like sort of making fun of some of the ladies, though.  They were kind of funny going, ew, ew, I'm looking for a man, ew.  You know, like making those noises and everything.  God, what's wrong with that?  That kind of made me laugh.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  What's wrong with those old cunts?  A life lady.  Hey, Patty, can we get you an escort?  An escort?  Yeah, what if you get a fine young gentleman escort?  Where would I be escorted to?  Oh, my God.  The end of your virginity?  Yes.  Exactly. 
[03:43:30]  A motel and a fucking crisis center.  A what?  Patty.  Yes?  We want you to maybe be involved in a thing we're doing at XM where guys are going to jerk  off and see who could blow a load first.  Jizz races.  Jizz races, we call it.  You would be there as sort of an obstacle.  Yeah, exactly.  You're part of the obstacle course.  One big obstacle.  You're like the tires.  You're the civilian that pops up in the shooting gallery. 
[03:44:00]  You're the sergeant that fires an AK over their heads.  The civilian that pops up in the shooting gallery.  He shot a good guy.  Oh, no.  Patty, so would you be interested in that?  You'd have to look.  Now, what you saw those guys doing on video, you'd have to kind of see that in real life  when they shoot that gooey stuff.  But the good news is that you'd be trying to stop the jizzing from happening.  Yes.  And your presence works as such an...  You're like a superhero. 
[03:44:30]  Yes.  Deturrent.  You're radiation on the cancer of fun.  Your voice and appearance make nobody want to ejaculate.  You make semen turtle.  It dries up on cottage cheese in someone's walls.  You make semen turn around and go back where it came from.  You actually have sperm crawl back into a dickhole and hide.  Each individual's sperm screams like it just saw Casper the Friendly Ghost.  And then they...  Ah, a ghost!  And then runs back into the jizz sack. 
[03:45:00]  Patty, you make semen swim back up into the Vaz Deverns and try to get shit out.  And make them balls explode.  Basically, they're saying you have no use at penis.  No sex appeal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Patty, would you be into that?  Would I...  So yes or no?  I mean, just like an observation type thing?  Yeah, yeah.  You would watch them do it and kind of talk to them and comment on their dicks or something.  And I'll tell you...  Maybe read from something.  Yeah, read from something.  All right, all right. 
[03:45:30]  That was our game.  All right, hold on.  Let's see how far we can take this.  Now, Patty, what if one of these guys let loose in your hair?  No.  I would give you $100.  You know, that's very good for your hair.  What do you think she is?  It's protein.  And you can take a shower right after, but I'll give you $100.  Wow.  A lot of money, Patty.  You need money.  And it's safe.  You can't catch any diseases if you're taking on the hair.  Oh, yeah.  It's totally safe.  Yeah, it is safe.  We want to cut your scalp with a razor first, though. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, no.  And invite Magic Johnson to the contest.  No, but that's a good idea, dude.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  What do you say?  You take, you know...  Take a batch of the hair.  Take a batch of the hair.  I believe this is soliciting prostitution, by the way.  It's for a film.  It certainly is.  No, it's not.  It certainly is.  Or is it?  Pornography is legal.  Is it?  If we film it and she's an actress?  It's a movie.  Absolutely.  And we're paying her as a pornographic actress.  She's not having sex with anybody. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, it's just silly.  You can't get arrested for being silly.  It's very silly.  Yeah?  Yeah, silly is safe.  But if I got to hook her and paid her $100 to jerk off on her?  As long as there's a camera.  Yeah, exactly.  I wouldn't do that.  Yeah.  So why don't the girl...  Why don't hookers just always have a camera with them?  It's illegal to film in New York porn, I think.  I'm just trying to see how we can get through this.  Patty, you're actually a natural saltpeter.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a tumbleweed blowing across... 
[03:47:00]  You know, it's hard to hear you.  Yeah, I know.  We're smashing you.  Patty.  Yeah.  Patty.  It's not good.  Maybe not your hair, but how about, like, on your tits?  What if the guys jerk off on your tits?  You might be the one person who would mind the tits less.  Hmm.  Wouldn't be in your hair.  I say hair.  Wash off easier.  Hair is much funnier.  No, but tits are funny because you could just fucking miss and hit her right in the mouth.  Oh, my God.  How funny would that be?  All over her face, bukkake. 
[03:47:30]  All right.  Um...  All over those glasses and her chiclet teeth.  Fuck.  That'd be funny.  We're basically complimenting you.  Oh, no.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, Stubbux.  I'm going to have to continue this another time, okay?  What, work or this call?  Yeah.  Because I got to go.  We're getting busy.  Where are you working?  Where are you working?  I'm at Starbucks.  I'm about to leave from my shift. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  All right.  You're talking about getting jerked off on and someone's waiting for a latte.  Yeah.  She can't look at the soy milk the same way again.  Now I know what's going on when I'm at Starbucks.  Yeah.  Some ladies on the phone.  Come on.  She's telling fucking jizz stories.  Fielding offers.  All right.  Go work.  Don't lose your fucking job.  Because we don't feel like paying bills.  All right.  I'll get back to you, okay?  All right.  Yeah.  Think about it.  You think it over, Patty.  All right.  Have tea with a friend.  And get some advice.  Throw a few lattes on your chest and let us know how it feels. 
[03:48:30]  Exactly.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Bye-bye-bye.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Thank you.  Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye.  All right, let's do line of the day.  Line of the day.  Let's do line of the day, and we'll get out of here.  Louis C.K.'s DVD, Shameless, comes out Tuesday.  His HBO spot.  Wow.  Three runner-ups.  Three runner-ups?  Yes.  All right, let's do a runner-up line of the day.  Shameless.  He is, though, right?  Nope.  Oh, there was a pause there. 
[03:49:00]  We know all about the pause.  I don't mean the pause that you're, you know, cutting off.  We're not talking about the pause and there are marks on your back.  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds.  Scratch them all, jump.  At least let the cats watch.  I love the oven mitts on the dog.  Oh, what a picture that conjures up.  You got to tape them because the dog wants to take them off.  And he walks across the room all funny like he's goose-stepping  because he's got oven mitts on his paws. 
[03:49:30]  He's got that weird look on his face.  Why are you doing this to me?  Is this?  Like he loves fucking her, but he hates the silly handwares.  Let's do another runner-up line of the day.  My clothes all wet with white stuff.  Is this my cum?  Did I cum?  Pretty good.  The OJ getting jizzed on.  I love it.  One more runner-up line of the day.  There was a family of like, it's nice, people that look like... 
[03:50:00]  Rich-hearted people?  Yeah, it was like the...  I forget their names, but they all had Down syndrome.  Like all these things.  Finagels?  Oh, is that a good one?  Yeah, it was a doozy.  Chimney's quick.  All right.  The nail.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  E-Rock, one last chance.  Butt rub?  Come on.  Come on, don't be a queer.  Come on.  Let's have some fun.  I know Craig would butt rub you. 
[03:50:30]  With his nose.  I know.  That's him nervously drinking.  Come on, E-Rock.  I'll buy you a new Nike hat.  Ooh.  Butt rub for a Nike hat.  Do you have a butt disease you want to give Jimmy?  Uh-oh.  You got cranky ass?  Cranky ass?  Yeah, he didn't wipe.  A little cranky ass.  Cranky because there hasn't been a cock in it yet.  It's like me with my coffee.  You can't talk to his asshole until a dick has been inside of it for a little while.  I was going to say.  I thought you put a dick in your coffee or something. 
[03:51:00]  No, no, no.  With a cup of coffee in the morning, right?  You need your coffee.  Don't mind me.  Hold on.  Please hold.  Thank you.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes.  La, la, la, la.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  La, la.  Dramatic.  Do they really want me to ask XM about this? 
[03:51:30]  And then he's signing it.  This is queer Steve C.  Very good.  But the beginning was cut off.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  What?  Wasn't the beginning of that cut off?  Did they cut off the beginning?  Yes, I am.  All right.  Why don't we do it again?  Here's today's.  Ah, you don't have to do it.  We'll start all over.  Here's today's line of the day.  That's the whole thing?  I thought there was more before that, like, where we actually talked about the actual.  But that's the beauty of the line of the day bit where we don't explain the lines. 
[03:52:00]  All right.  It was a very good line.  It was an extremely good line.  You never know what hearing at that time.  But that's the beauty of the bit where you don't explain it.  Hey, as long as it's a victory in my column, I'm fine with it.  It was a context line of the day.  Yes.  Good one.  All right.  You rock?  Butt rub?  Come on.  Come on.  Take us out with a butt rub.  What better way to end the show?  This was a great show.  Take us out with a butt rub.  Butt rub.  Jimmy, would you take a butt rub from anyone else in the room?  Don't look at me, please. 
[03:52:30]  In this room, yeah, any of you guys would, but nobody else.  Oh, no one outside studio?  No.  Because they're going to send that fucking intern in here who'd love to.  He'd love to.  It's not fun if you love to.  Craig would not only do it, but he'd do it off mic, like, once the show was over.  Yeah, I just didn't want to do it on the radio.  At 4.30, we'll meet in butt rub somewhere.  A rest stop?  Yeah.  We'll meet in fucking Washington Square Park. 
[03:53:00]  No, buddy.  Iraq, butt rub?  Butt rub?  Come on.  If I had to choose, I would take Eric.  Yeah.  I, oh, God.  It's going to suck when we order him to do it.  I really don't want it to get to that.  I know.  Like, if he just would do it, it wouldn't get to the awkward point of us making him do it.  It's a terrible thing to take to your next job interview.  So why did you leave your last position?  Because I wouldn't rub my ass against another guy's ass.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, people feel chipped today because they didn't really get to hear the darn after line of the day. 
[03:53:30]  Oh.  It was there, but it was weak in the background, and we all talked over it.  Tomorrow.  Darn.  There you go.  From the cell phone, how great is it that, talking about jizzing her hair with Starger Patty,  and she has to ask a customer if he wants one or two shots.  All right, I guess.  I don't think we're getting a part of it.  Sam, butt rub?  You're just the camera guy.  He's just here with his camera.  You're just the camera guy for butt rub. 
[03:54:00]  He's the camera.  Waiting for his fruit roll-up for dinner and jujibes.  Yeah, what's for lunch today?  Yeah, what are you having for lunch there, Sam?  We never ask the lunch question.  Always the dinner question.  Peanut butter sandwich.  You should have to ask.  Cut into four squares?  Every day, right?  Peanut butter and fluff?  No, just peanut butter.  I don't know.  Just peanut butter sandwich.  Yes, Iraq?  Butt rub?  Stupid Travis is going to get my lunch out of my bag.  Out of my bag.  Bag.  My bag. 
[03:54:30]  That's not his fucking lunch.  You've done it?  He's done it last time?  Oh, God.  And then three Oreo cookies.  Why three?  Aw.  That's what it is.  Well, three is what?  Who did this?  My girlfriend.  Your girlfriend did this?  Yes.  She was very upset last time when you smushed it.  Yes, Jimmy actually smushed it last time.  See, really?  She was really sad when Jim smushed it.  She's going to get upset again.  Jimmy just punted it.  Holy shit.  What happens when we mess up your lunch? 
[03:55:00]  You can't just go out there and get eight-year-old food in Manhattan.  Not on the street.  Nobody else makes it.  Aw, poor Sam.  No one makes eight-year-old food.  Oh, he looks like he's ready to cry.  How are the Oreos doing after that?  You can still eat that.  Yeah, that's edible.  Yeah, that's edible.  I don't think the bag broke.  Actually, I'm not going to step on the sandwich.  I'm going to pay him 20 bucks like I did last time.  You really?  The $20 fucking sandwich.  Dude, butt rub his sandwich.  All right.  Oh, God.  He just ate it.  He just went into it. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  There you go.  Thank E-Rock for this.  Yeah, thanks, E-Rock.  This is how we end the show, like men.  There you go.  He's rubbing up peanut butter in his ass.  He puts it back in.  He puts it back in like no one's going to notice.  Jess is going to be very upset.  She got so sad last time.  We better call her tomorrow. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, my God.  We better get a Jess update tomorrow.  Peanut butter up his ass.  It looks like he makes that himself.  He dresses like his mother and then makes that.  He's like fucking Stallone.  He's like Stallone.  He's like Stallone.  He walks in a dress.  Yes, exactly.  Yeah, that was believable.  Yeah.  All right.  You can't even eat the cookies now.  They're contaminated.  They're crushed.  I can't crush cookies by kicking them?  No, I know they're crushed, but they're in a separate bag.  They're in a separate bag, so you can take them and eat them, but now they've been contaminated 
[03:56:30]  with your ass.  Yeah, the whole thing.  You go hungry today.  No one's going to pick through that for what's still edible.  For tasty.  No, no, Jimmy.  Not today.  Make him go hungry.  Yeah.  He could use with losing a few pounds.  He's getting a little chunky.  Today he gets 10.  Jimmy has paid more for rubbing his ass on people.  Hey, listen.  Let's thank Louis C.K.  Absolutely.  Always a pleasure, Louis.  Shameless on DVD this coming Tuesday.  That's right.  Our listeners will be picking that up like crazy, Louis. 
[03:57:00]  Thanks, guys.  Guaranteed.  And, Jimmy, thanks for the great ending.  We needed a great ending, but you rock.  It's all about him.  It's not about the show.  It's obviously.  Sandwich butt rub.  I remember the days you would do stuff for the show.  Yeah, it's all about him.  It's no longer the O.B. Anthony show.  It's just Eric's desires.  He probably has a rash or something.  Do you have diaper rash?  Adult diaper rash.  What's the reason?  Pimply butt?  Prickly heat?  What's the reason?  As painful as it was to do it last time, the ending was not very pleasant. 
[03:57:30]  Did I fart it on you?  Oh, it was hot and disgusting.  Oh, I forgot about that.  I forgot about that little treat.  I fired one on his asshole.  I forgot about that.  He might be on something, Jimmy.  So he actually had to fart your fart out at one point.  Exactly.  Some of it seeped in.  You didn't have to fucking fart someone else's gas.  Basically, he's saying you didn't keep it fair last time.  That's horrible.  I hit below the belt.  I fucking cut a gasser right in his juicy, rapable asshole.  Didn't you try to turn around, too?  There was something else that you were trying to do. 
[03:58:00]  You raped his asshole with a gaffy dick.  With the most basic of elements.  I wanted to turn around and smack his ass in my dick, but I was like afraid that could  be a human resources issue.  I'd get in trouble.  But butt rubbing's okay.  That's harmless.  Butt rubbing.  Elo would have an issue with that.  He'd probably be mad that I didn't do it to him.  That's true.  The gas.  Fart is a gas, but everything has...  It must have a solid and liquid form, too.  If you can trap that fart in something and maybe pressurize it or condense it into a  different temperature, you could actually get liquid fart and drink it. 
[03:58:30]  Or a solid fart.  Yeah.  I understand Iraq's stance at this point now.  How's that done?  I forgot about the fart thing, Jim.  I'm fascinated now.  There's something to it.  I'm going to go to the lab after this.  She can't get a grant for that, so nobody's...  No.  Iraq felt the warm air.  He felt it.  Oh.  Was it one of those...  No.  Where she just goes...  It was one of those moments where you felt you'll never be clean again.  It was loud.  It was like a...  Right?  It was hot and loud.  Everything a fart should be. 
[03:59:00]  If you were going to write a song about a fart, that would be the one.  Like, Bette Midler sang about that one.  Bob Dylan wrote a anthem about that fart.  Great.  That's good.  Now I understand why he might have been a little shy to do it.  Why did they make the noise when...  I always thought it was like your cheeks kind of bouncing together.  But if you spread your ass cheeks, it makes a tooting noise.  What the fuck?  What's...  I think you can only spread like the anus.  But your sphincter probably is still puckered enough to make that sound a little inside. 
[03:59:30]  Like one of those balloons when you let it out a little bit.  Yeah, you could...  So that's going on inside.  All right.  You ever have an internal fart?  Yeah, sure.  It's an actual sound like a...  But it's inside your stomach.  It's the other anus that's in your...  Yeah, inside it kind of just going through another asshole.  Through your intestine.  Sometimes if I don't eat right, I start shitting in my stomach into my own bloodstream.  When I don't eat right.  Yeah.  When I don't have my first food groups. 
[04:00:00]  Reading from Whack Bag.  E-Rock doesn't want to touch butts because E-Rock has diarrhea from the fat smash diet.  Could be.  Probably does.  Explosive diarrhea?  No.  How's that going for you?  Are you good?  Good.  Good man.  You're running out of days, you know.  Yep.  Next Thursday.  That's it.  Next Thursday?  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Every shitty cake looks like rice pudding.  How many pounds do you got to lose in a week?  I think I got about six more.  Five, six more pounds.  That's the hardest.  It's the hardest.  It's the Dr. Ian Smith bet. 
[04:00:30]  We'll talk about that tomorrow.  We're going to go.  All right.  The last ton is always the hardest.  Oh.  I'm teasing my buddy E-Rock.  He knows he's my friend.  You coming on the boat this fourth?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Well, fuck you then.  Go fuck yourself.  Like last year wasn't fun enough.  You want some drunk driving?  Some fun?  Come on.  To what?  The boat.  What boat?  Billy Mac's boat.  We take it out on the East River there and go by the UN and watch the fireworks. 
[04:01:00]  Can I go?  If you want to, yeah.  You're cordially invited.  Maybe I'll bring my broad.  Bring your broad with you.  Maybe I'll bring my broad.  I'm getting car service because I should have gotten life in prison last time for how I drove drunk.  I want to say to everybody, never do that.  But I actually, it wasn't good enough to just drive drunk and try to be safe.  I raced from about Shea Stadium into Midtown Manhattan.  Were we down to, I have no idea where we were. 
[04:01:30]  I know we were somewhere in Manhattan.  I remember going through a tunnel.  Did we take the tunnel or the bridge?  I have no idea.  I was hammered.  Iraq's trying to remind you that you went to New York City to play fuse ball.  Because that's how you write that word.  Fuse ball.  Yeah, that's what I was playing.  Big bomb that you light and throw it.  Like that joke.  F ball.  Fuse ball.  We played fuse ball.  I drove full drunk once with like lots of people in the car.  It was like a classic.  So, yeah.  That was it.  Wiping out a bunch of kids.  Should have just killed everybody.  And I had to have one eye closed so I didn't see two of shit. 
[04:02:00]  That's how drunk I was.  That's bad.  Driving with one eye and going really fast and laughing.  That's the last thing you should ever see.  Yeah.  Before you just hit something.  Should have died.  And I did spin out.  I was on Sturro Drive in Boston.  Oh, man.  That's nasty.  And I hit a nasty curve and I spun.  The whole car spun many times.  See?  Thank God it was the middle of the night.  Nobody else was coming.  Thank God your body should have been thrown out of it.  They should have found you in a fucking berries shrub.  Yeah.  No.  I had no problem.  Dirty talk sneakers.  I had no problem that time.  But I heard something very frightening this morning. 
[04:02:30]  It was on the news.  They're trying to pass legislation for if you're drunk and cause a fatality.  Life in prison.  Sure.  Yeah.  Life in prison.  I think that sounds right.  Oh, yeah.  And then I'm thinking to myself, that sounds right.  And then you think like.  Could happen to me in 10 seconds.  Might be an accident.  I'm two moves away from that.  But it's not your fault.  Yeah.  Like you're drinking.  But you know, somebody else screws up.  And all of a sudden you're just out having a good time. 
[04:03:00]  And then you're in prison for the rest of your life.  Just think of that like.  No, it's true.  That could happen.  Good time.  Prison for the rest of your life.  You could be one notch above legal alcohol.  Yeah.  And you get in an accident that wasn't your fault and somebody dies.  Somebody dies.  Yeah.  Prison for life.  Yep.  What about fucking.  That's scary.  I live with that kind of fear every time I fuck a boy's mouth.  Prison for life.  You know, you just learn.  Hey.  You know.  It's safer being in an airplane.  All that kind of. 
[04:03:30]  Right.  Most people slip in a bathtub.  Some things are worth the rest, Lou.  Exactly.  Let's get out of here.  All right.  Yeah.  It is time to go.  Opie left hours ago.  We've been going over every day.  He just left.  He's probably recorded the promo and is gone.  But again, thank you, Louie.  Thank you.  Louie CK.  Always fun to have you in.  Thank you.  DVD when?  The 26th of June.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Yes.  Pick it up.  Hysterical.  Jimmy Norton.  My pal.  I have nothing going on. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, wait.  Maybe some things.  There's surprises around the corner.  I know that.  That's all I'll say.  My cock is at you.  Oh, I'm at Crackers in Indianapolis for the four people still listening.  Oh.  Are you going to go to Bob and Tom?  Crackers.  Yeah, I'll go over there.  Is that good?  I'll be at Crackers in Indianapolis this weekend.  Cool.  And that is the show.  I want to see if your ex goes up.  Show. 
[04:04:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. </pre>
