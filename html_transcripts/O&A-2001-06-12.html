<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a post-mortem of the disastrous "Motley Crue Challenge," a competition involving overweight women vying for money placed on a phallic-shaped object. The hosts and callers alike found the event repulsive, citing the participants' body odor and the overall unsavory nature of the spectacle.  Tony Danza's unexpected studio appearance, marked by his visible discomfort at the sight of the naked women, further highlighted the segment's failure.  The discussion included graphic descriptions from the video footage, with callers and hosts commenting on the women’s appearance and the pervasive smell.  Bluto, a particularly vocal caller, heavily criticized the segment.  The hosts then previewed upcoming segments, including an interview with the notoriously outrageous Sandy Kane and a humorous bit titled "Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail."  They also compared their show's controversial content to Don Imus’ show, referencing Imus' firing and rehiring of Sid Rosenberg for offensive remarks.  Listener reactions to the "Motley Crue Challenge" ranged from initial disgust to begrudging amusement, with the segment concluding with a Stephen Lynch song.

The show continued with a prolonged discussion of Don West's departure from Shop at Home Network, featuring comedic reenactments of West's outrageous sales pitches.  This transitioned into a series of sexually explicit phone calls with listeners, notably a lengthy and vulgar conversation with an 18-year-old woman from Philadelphia, and discussions surrounding a "hot moms" contest, reflecting a recurring theme of the hosts' attempts to engage teenage girls.  Stockbroker Dave provided financial updates amidst the raunchy banter, and additional callers shared their experiences with younger women. Sandy Kane was mentioned and later joined the show in studio, adding to the off-color commentary with stories including a dentist-related dental mishap.

Sandy Kane dominated the next segment, beginning with a discussion of a dentist who allegedly damaged her teeth. A caller praised a previous, humorously described, on-air incident involving a butt plug, before the conversation shifted to a graphic description, and eventual on-air display, of Sandy's hemorrhoid.  This was followed by an equally graphic examination of her toes and feet. The discovery of a growth near her genitals, variously described as an ear, skin tag, and suspected genital warts, sparked further intense discussion and varying levels of disgust and fascination from the hosts and callers, with one host vomiting.  Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a guest in the studio, reacted with growing horror and bewilderment.  The hosts repeatedly offered photos of the growth to their website, and listeners called in to detail their reactions to the images. The segment ended with continued discussion of the growth, plans to post photos online, and promotion of a Spinal Tap show and the "hot moms" contest.


The final segment featured a continuation of the Joseph Gordon-Levitt interview, covering his early career, including anecdotes about a Sunny Jim peanut butter commercial and his role in *Angels in the Outfield*.  The hosts interacted with several callers, including a Lakers fan and "Uncle John," who received tickets to Gordon-Levitt's play, *Uncle Bob*, which was heavily promoted.  A significant portion of the segment involved Marco, a self-described gay "theater queen," who initially panned the play before being appeased and given tickets by Gordon-Levitt.  This exchange involved sexually suggestive language and gay-themed jokes from the hosts.  Sandy Kane called in again to promote her show, only to once again display her genital growth, prompting a strong negative reaction from the hosts and bringing a pungent and chaotic end to the segment.  The hosts also announced upcoming events, including the Spinal Tap show and a visit from the *20/20 Downtown* crew, all while utilizing numerous crude jokes and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony.  Proving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  Teen sex.  What's that?  Teen sex.  What's that?  Teen sex.  Teen sex.  Hold on.  I'm dirty.  I'm dirty.  I'm dirty.  Can you give me a bath?  Oh, boy.  I think I want to be a hooker when I grow up.  Okay, terrific.  Hey, stop it. 
[00:00:30]  Can I see your stuff?  Can I see your stuff?  This doesn't taste like banana juice.  Can you get me drunk again?  Daddy, I don't like it.  Bend over.  Daddy, my poopy hurts.  What's a tampon?  Oh, no.  What's the leather Cheerios?  Dirty, dirty, dirty little skank.  Grandpa, you're so much bigger than Daddy.  What's that?  Popcorn bucket.  If I shake your bottle, will it pop?  Oh, yeah.  I'm drunk now, so it won't hurt.  Show me, girlie.  Daddy, look what I did to you again. 
[00:01:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show today.  Hello.  It's two for Tuesday.  Oh, uh.  What?  Whoa, we don't play music?  Every city's got one.  The two for Tuesday.  So it'll be twice as annoying today.  Yeah, you got two A-holes for today. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  877-692-1027.  If you want in on the show today, we're going to go right to the phones and talk to Bluto.  Bluto, what's up?  Hey, man.  Oh, my gosh.  As long as we were talking about sushi, let's discuss yesterday's show.  Yes, go ahead.  Do not, I repeat, do not ever have two fat chicks with the MC Challenge again.  What's come at it, Blisco?  That was like erection kryptonite.  Oh, my God.  I was going to be sick.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he likes the skinny ones like olives. 
[00:02:00]  The ones you could split skin, too.  The ones with the fragile pusky.  Oh, my God.  I was so sick yesterday.  Don't do that to me again.  Then come in this morning with sushi.  Hey, Bluto, you didn't even see the show, though.  Oh, I heard it.  The way you guys described it, pull back your belly, please.  I want to see that.  Yeah, whenever you got to say pull back your belly so you could see their vitals.  Yeah, that's a bad sign right there.  It was hilarious, and you missed a lot of the show because Jay Moore decided that he's  going to get so dirty that we're dumping out of the show like crazy. 
[00:02:30]  I'm going to strangle that guy today.  Did you see the dump sheet from yesterday?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It was a full page of dumps.  You should have had her use her leg instead of that tool you had.  Oh, my God.  It was huge.  The best part, we should explain.  We were doing the Motley Crue Challenge.  We debuted the game on our show yesterday, and we might have to do it again today and get  some hot girls so we can get the bad taste out of our mouths.  But that's like anything else.  It takes time, Opie.  You can't just pull a gag out like the Motley Crue Challenge and expect it to go off without 
[00:03:00]  a hitch.  Day one.  Yeah, we had Big Butt Mendy from Big Butt Magazine.  She goes, what, 230, I think she said.  And our new friend Carmen from Harlem, redhead with huge boobs and huge everything else and  completely red hair.  Yeah, that's a lovely picture.  She had to go about 220, 230 herself.  I think she admitted to, no, what did she say?  I didn't say 180 or something. 
[00:03:30]  There's no way she's 180 or 220.  Each one, maybe.  180.  And then they did the Motley Crue Challenge with a lovely double donger with money hanging  in the middle.  Yeah.  And the belly.  And the first girl to get to the middle of this double donger won the $100 bill.  Speaking of sharks, it looked like a feeding frenzy.  Eric, if you're listening to Anthony, call me Hammer.  All right.  Hammer.  And at one point, we lost the $100 bill.  It disappeared.  Stinky, what a brave soul Stinky is for us. 
[00:04:00]  He actually dug right in.  He got in the fray.  Sort of like sticking your hand between two fighting pit bulls.  Who would ever do that?  And believe me, I thought I saw gums and teeth and everything.  That was horrifying.  And Stinky just comes in and pulls out a soaking wet $100 bill.  Yeah.  Soaked.  Yeah.  It was out there.  And to have Tony Danza in the middle of the mix.  Angela.  Yeah.  He came walking in.  He sees the two girls laying on the couch. 
[00:04:30]  He was horrified.  And he ran out of here.  Tony Danza just dropped in yesterday at the end of the show for no apparent reason.  He walks in.  And there are two huge girls on a couch, completely naked, lubing up a double dung, getting ready for action.  Something tells me the old Tony Danza, from the old taxi days maybe, he'd have been right in here, boozing it up, enjoying the show.  Something happened to Tony.  Well, he does the soft shoe now.  He does soft shoe dancing, putting on these shows in New York.  And he doesn't want to look over at the couch. 
[00:05:00]  He didn't even want to take a look.  It amazes me.  You know he wanted to look.  I know.  But he didn't want to be in the paper or in the rag magazines that he was checking out something so horrific.  That's what these guys think, too.  They get it in their head that, oh, my God, if a picture's taken, if it turns up in one of those rag magazines, you know, the Globe or the Inquirer turned around and printed a picture of Tony Danza with these two huge naked broads with a double dung.  Oh, my God.  The other thing with Tony Danza yesterday, you see the glare coming off his fingernails? 
[00:05:30]  That guy is like Mr. GQ now.  Man.  You see him?  He's all done up.  Like, he's a high-maintenance guy now.  It looks like that.  He'd still kick your ass, though.  What happened to the old taxi Tony Danza?  Well, they still had to call him Tony for the show because he didn't know who the hell they would call him.  All right, Tony Danza, your name's going to be Mike on the show Taxi?  Oh, okay.  Mike.  Mike.  Tony, huh? 
[00:06:00]  No, your name's Mike for the show.  Oh, okay.  Mike.  You got this cab, Mike?  Mike.  Tony.  What?  Is that a true story?  I like to believe it.  I like to believe he was a blithering idiot enough that, all right, we'll just call him Tony.  Now, where's Steve from foundrymusic.com?  I've got to ask him something about yesterday's show.  So, Jim, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I think Tony Danza wanted to get in on that.  That's why he left so early.  He couldn't control himself.  No way.  No, he didn't want any part of it. 
[00:06:30]  What was the smell like in there?  It had to be something awful.  Well, the girls swear they didn't fart, but I don't know.  Something was happening.  Something was going on.  You guys should have somebody like Melissa do that.  We would love someone like Melissa to do that.  You guys keep bringing all them fat chicks in there.  I know.  I know.  We got off on a bad start there, on the wrong foot.  But, you know, it makes for great radio.  Jim, I'll tell you, though.  We'll up the ante.  It'll get better.  You guys are doing a great job.  Like Anthony said, you've got to start somewhere. 
[00:07:00]  And we had to start with two fatties.  They did a great job, though.  I was laughing pretty hard.  Oh, man.  I wanted to be aroused, but instead I had to go.  Yeah, that ain't going to happen.  But instead I got a good chuckle, so I'm okay with that.  Can I say what's up to somebody?  Yo, go, Jim.  I want to say what's up, Billy.  There you go.  I hate to go back to what we were doing earlier, the Al Roker thing, but Jim from Armonct's got a great line that we didn't use.  You're in a sushi bar and someone yells barracuda.  Everyone goes, huh?  What?  You yell Al Roker.  We got a panic on our hands on the 4th of July. 
[00:07:30]  Very good, Jim.  That's good.  Forgot that one.  On the 4th of July.  On the 4th of July.  You can't close these beaches because you see Al Roker.  The mayor with the best.  The mayor of Amity.  What a tool.  I think I watch that movie once a week.  DVD.  We got a panic on our hands on the 4th of July.  Playing the video games that Al Roker eating.  You got to shoot him with the spear.  Steve C.  Steve, what's up?  Do you have footage from the Motley Crue Challenge from yesterday? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.  Got some vid?  Yeah.  Nice.  Some pretty rough stuff, actually.  There's some video up on the site now.  It's rather tame.  We're still working on a way to get the Harder Edge stuff.  Harder Edge.  The disgusting, putrid, disgusting-smelling, haddock-smelling video.  But at the least, people can check out what the girls look like, right?  Yes.  You got them topless, at least?  Oh, totally.  Okay, that's okay.  Fuck-ass naked in all 700 pounds of them.  I got to say something about the girls that were in yesterday. 
[00:08:30]  Stop exaggerating.  They were two girls weighed 500 pounds.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Pardon me.  I got to say something, though.  Now, I'm not going to say any names.  It's almost like, you know when they do the firing squad and they give one guy the blanks  so everyone has it in their head?  Maybe they weren't the ones that shot the person.  So I'm going to do this.  I'm not going to say the girls' names, so maybe they'll think it's the other girl.  Okay.  Maybe Carmine, oh, the Carmen, will think it's Mendy and vice versa.  One of those girls, one of those girls had an aroma coming off of them. 
[00:09:00]  And I use the term aroma so I don't have to use the word putrid odor.  And why are you being polite?  It was Carmen.  Was it?  Oh, without a doubt.  See, I'm not saying.  See, Mendy may be fat, but she takes care of herself.  There's only so much a big gal can do.  It was Carmen.  There's only so much a big gal can do.  You know why?  Because it was a foreign smell.  And we've been around Mendy enough to know what she's all about. 
[00:09:30]  The fat girls, you've got to bathe like once an hour.  Because it just seems that it's a stereotype that isn't going to go away if there's still smelly fat girls.  You can't stink like that.  All right.  Andrew's got a problem.  Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, if Motley Crue finds out you had two fat bros in there,  they're going to send you a season to six and get the name.  I know.  You know what?  Andrew.  Yeah.  Could we get Vince or Nicky on the show today to tell them what we did?  Could you guys please call it the winger challenge? 
[00:10:00]  We might as well confess to those guys what happened.  The zebra.  The zebra.  Zebra.  The poison challenge.  God damn.  That was such a poor way to start that off.  You've got to beg because it's really important.  I'll beg.  Yeah, get one of the two guys.  Make sure they realize they were the ones that sent us down this road,  and I don't know.  They're not going to be happy with us.  I learned it from you, okay?  I learned it from you.  Because when Vince and Nicky were explaining what they used to do backstage, 
[00:10:30]  it sounded hot.  Oh, man, did it sound hot.  Just picturing the girls that went to the Motley Crue shows with those spandex  and little shirts and everything,  and pictured two of them doing it.  And what did we get?  Jesus Christ.  You know, but if they tried to do it now,  I wonder the caliber of women they'd get.  Better than what we had, Steve.  Yeah, you're right.  No, they could still get it at home.  Don, what's going on?  I've got to tell you guys, I'm down here in Philly.  When you first came on, I was a bit upset,  but yesterday you guys are starting to grow on me. 
[00:11:00]  Uh-oh.  The fungus.  Yes, we call it the fungus.  You haven't heard anything yet.  Give us some time, Don.  Well, I remember the very first day you said,  if anything crosses the line,  you'll probably end up dumping into Van Halen,  and I kept waiting to see what song was going to come on.  Yeah, we actually, we get away with murder.  Well, pretty amazing.  We've learned how to do this type of radio and keep it safe.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, Don.  Way to go, guys.  All right, man.  That's cool.  That, you know, that makes me feel a little better. 
[00:11:30]  Now I'll just go to the Philly Instant Feedback.  Oh, don't worry.  No, it's already printed up in front of me.  Oh, you've got a stack there.  Yeah, let me see.  Oh, someone wants one of our posters.  Okay, here you go.  Tim from Pennsylvania.  Your show sucks.  I could listen to talk radio.  We need the nonstop rock back.  People hate change.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, but Dom's phone call, Opie, was so nice.  Why are you reening it?  Oh.  Oh, man. 
[00:12:00]  Actually, it's not too bad today.  Your show sucks.  Oh, here's one.  Gary from Pennsylvania.  So how come you guys never play any cults?  They are a great band that has been around for years.  The cults are the hardest-working band out there.  They are better than the bum band Creed.  I'm sick of them and never like them.  So please, guys, play some new cults.  Please.  WISP rocks hard.  Oh, by the way, has Melissa ever done any Playboy or other mags?  Thanks, guys.  And then, I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  That hate mail's getting boring.  Yeah.  We'll turn some people around.  We know that.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  My God.  Yeah, so hopefully we can do the challenge again and have a couple of better contestants.  The sooner the better.  Yeah.  We might have to call up Privilege and get some girls down here, some ringers.  Ah.  Nick, what's going on?  Yo, O&A.  Hey.  How are you doing today, guys?  Good.  Listen, you guys got to do me a favor.  All right.  When you talk to Steve from Foundry Music, you got to make him stop using the Stacker 2 voice. 
[00:13:00]  This guy is always in character.  It's always the same voice.  He's driving me insane.  He doesn't like your radio voice, I guess.  I love it.  It's just, I love his voice.  I love the guy.  I love the whole website.  But it's just, you can't hear him say a word without thinking back to the Stacker 2 spot.  What?  That's not, what are you talking about?  Right now you sound fine.  But anything else.  I give up. 
[00:13:30]  Anything else you say, man.  Don't speak.  You sound just like you're doing the commercial.  Well, gee, that's my voice.  No, it isn't.  Gee, don't get Steve agitated.  It's expectation.  Who are you kidding?  Steve has a very fragile ego sometimes.  I'm sorry, Steve.  I didn't mean to hurt you.  He's a big boy, but you can get to him very easy.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Man.  Hey, Larry, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Congratulations, number one. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, thank you.  After it's been inside an elephant on each end.  We'll just get another one.  We'll just get new ones.  I think you have to.  After the stinking and the wetness, I have to.  No, that one got destroyed.  It's over.  Oh, I'm sure it did.  That went out with the garbage.  Something was happening with Carmen yesterday.  Did you notice that?  They were on the couch.  Mendy is trying to win the $100 bill by grabbing with her hands and using her hands to try to  get herself closer to that $100, let's just.  This yelp sound and shut her eyes and winced and put her head back. 
[00:14:30]  Either she was in extreme pleasure or it was like someone kicked her in the vulva.  It was really disturbing.  It might have been hot.  I believe she was getting turned on a bit there.  You think?  Sure.  All right, Larry.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, I'm open.  I didn't mean to do that.  I'm sorry.  Tom, what's up?  You're next.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just was at the website, man.  I saw those two chicks.  From yesterday.  Holy smoke, man.  They got so much skin.  They look like two Sharpays who were mating and got stuck. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Now, what website did you go to?  Foundry.  Oh, foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  What?  Anthony's got the pictures of it.  I got the ones from N-E-W.com up.  And I'm horrified.  W-N-E-W.com.  Turn that around.  Look at that.  Here we go.  Look at Norton.  In between.  That's Jim Norton.  In between two huge, gigantic asses.  I swear to God, Mindy, it looks like she took her pants off, took her panties off, and sat down bare-assed on a gravel driveway for about an hour. 
[00:15:30]  Got up, brushed the gravel off, and took this picture.  What other pictures did they get up there?  Just that one?  Jim looks horrified.  They got this hot one right here.  No.  Of Norton.  Also, two girls.  That's what sucks about W-N-E-W.com.  Those are the only two pictures from yesterday that we can put up there.  And that one.  That's it.  Yeah.  Oh, well. 
[00:16:00]  Well, at least you can see what the girls look like.  Horrific.  The horror.  The horror.  Tony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Not going to say congrats.  I was just going to say about effing time.  No, thanks, Tony.  That's syndicated.  Thank you, Tony.  Dude, as much as we love to rip on Mindy, the girl is a trooper.  Yeah.  Just like any other fat girl, she tries harder, right?  One more quick thing.  You should have gave Stinky a safe word like Ongawa to break up them two elephants going 
[00:16:30]  at it.  You guys are out of your minds, man.  With the double dong, it looked like two elephants fighting over a peanut.  Stinky was classic because he had to get in there to see who was going to win the challenge  because you really couldn't tell.  There was so much blubber.  Like the wreck in the middle of a fight.  You know, sometimes he's really got to get in there.  And he was way in there when one of the girls let loose some gas.  Stinky get out of him.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, the quake bomb.  That's what ended it all.  That's what stopped the challenge. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Stinky get out of the pay for that.  Uh, no.  No, it's just part of the job.  Keep it up, guys.  You're doing great, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we have one of our favorites coming in today, Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane is coming in today.  I don't even know how to describe this woman.  It's just another horrific sight.  Yeah.  So far, we've brought you the retarded Laverne and Shirley,  the two fat chicks doing the Motley Crue Challenge. 
[00:17:30]  And today, I mean, why stop?  We're going to have Sandy Kane.  She is probably the most disgusting individual you'll ever see.  If you go to the website and hear on this radio show.  And the stinky cam's not working?  We crashed that yesterday?  No, no, Opie.  I heard from our crack computer guy, Scott Columbo.  We are getting a brand new server software that will be able to accept the camera.  Well, maybe we could at least get some digital pictures of Sandy Kane as soon as she arrives. 
[00:18:00]  Put them on www.com so people could get a look at Sandy as we talk to her today.  You'll be amazed at her sounds, her different sounds.  She just makes these disgusting sounds.  How old is this woman?  We've got to ask her today.  I'm pegging her at 73.  I was going to say, yeah.  I'm like about 73.  No, 78.  You know what?  I think she's just seen a lot, and she's probably only in her 60s.  Oof. 
[00:18:30]  Seriously.  Do you think that ridden hard and put up wet, she's got city miles on her?  I'll go with 60, I'll go with 63.  I'm 35.  I'm 35.  Ooh, ooh.  And she used to work in the peep shows.  She's seen it all.  She probably worked in vaudeville.  She's old.  She has no problem getting naked and showing parts of her that you would never, ever want to even see. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Frank, what's up?  What is the matter with you guys?  What?  We're trying to win it for Philly, and you give them Sandy Kane, the retarded Laverne and Shirley,  two hours of duty talk, and the fat chicks?  It's a strategy.  Why fake it?  We might as well just show them everything, all the blemishes and the pimples that we got.  What do you do?  You soften up the beaches before you send in the troops.  I give up.  We're pounding them with artillery.  I feel pounded, and I'm the faithful listener. 
[00:19:30]  Jesus Christ.  How about some teens?  How about some cool stuff?  Well, that will make you appreciate it that much better.  Frank, just imagine if you're in Philly, and you're hearing the message we've given them so far,  but we break out teen week.  Huh.  Well, if you eat steak every day, if someone gives you a cracker, you'll be like,  ooh, that's a good cracker.  That's what that is.  Saltine, that's a good cracker.  So that's kind of like the people on Survivor.  They have rice all the time, and they're happy for a cheeseburger.  Yeah.  That's it.  See?  Yeah, we're going to give them some good stuff soon enough. 
[00:20:00]  All right, guys.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Everyone knows we love the teen girls.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, were you guys really just trying to purposely fail here?  What's going on?  I mean, you're offering garbage day after day.  I don't blame it.  Like the XFL all over again.  I have a feeling a few people were talking about the two fat chicks doing the Motley  Crew Challenge today around the water cooler.  Just a couple.  But Jesus Christ, I mean.  You know, that's part of the beauty of it.  Beauty.  Yeah.  I've seen those pictures. 
[00:20:30]  There's nothing beautiful about those girls.  Oh, that's true.  They might be beautiful on the end.  Just a little bit upset here.  And where are the privileged girls?  We'll get them down here eventually.  All right.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Thanks.  We've got to get through Sandy Kane first today.  Rick, any luck on Vince or Nikki today?  She's working on it.  All right.  She's got some calls out.  She's calling again.  So she's working on it.  You told them that.  It's really important, right?  I told them it's extremely important.  It has to do with their Motley Crew Challenge.  Okay.  Very good.  I'm sure he'll be so proud.  Out of everything they've done, you know, you read their book. 
[00:21:00]  What's that?  Dirt?  Dirt, which is a great book by Motley Crew.  Yeah.  You read their book and you realize they've done every kind of debauchery and just horrific sexual thing between all of them.  And this will upset them.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  They're not going to be happy with us today.  Using the crew's name in vain.  All right.  As we take our first break, Anthony, something from the archives.  It's actually off our CD, Dementor World, that, I don't know, you can't find anywhere. 
[00:21:30]  Can't find anywhere and we don't get paid.  Limited edition, people.  Limited edition.  And we don't get paid for it or anything, but it's still a good bit.  It's a collector's item.  Something called Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail.  Mm-hmm.  It's part of our Hi, Mom series.  So far, we've brought you Hi, Mom, I'm in Porno.  Hi, Mom, I'm Gay.  We've got to play Hi, Mom, I got fired from work for masturbating.  That's a great one.  Oh, wait.  They're not going to let me say that.  Oh.  I think you can say that. 
[00:22:00]  No, they don't bother that all the time.  Every time, no matter what the context?  Yep.  So I should have said, we've got to play the Hi, Mom, I got fired from work for pleasuring myself.  But he uses the M-word, so, right?  We'll have to keep it, I guess.  Oh, whatever.  We'll figure that out.  But from Dementor World, here's Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail.  Jason, are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail?  Yeah.  You got a good story?  Yeah.  What are you going to tell her?  I'm going to tell her I had marijuana.  I got caught by the cops. 
[00:22:30]  Will that piss her off?  Yep.  All right, let's give her a shot.  It's rugs.  Hello?  Mom?  What?  I screwed up.  What?  I'm in jail.  Why?  I have possession of marijuana.  You're kidding.  I don't know who to call.  Should I call Uncle Mark?  It's my one phone call.  Should I call Uncle Mark or something?  I'll ask you.  Is this your one phone call?  I'll have to call him.  What do you need?  I don't know.  The call is being monitored, ma'am, by the police department. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  What does he need to do?  The judge came in and set bail at $10,000.  It's a very serious offense.  $10,000?  Well, if it was a joint or two, it would be one thing.  He was caught with 12 kilos in his trunk, obviously trying to deal.  So he's being arraigned as a dealer and not as a user.  Okay.  Okay, when is all this and when did, where are you, where is he and where can I come see him? 
[00:23:30]  I'm in Cambridge now at the Cambridge jail.  We're going to bring him to one of the city jails.  Okay, how can I get directions to get there?  Can I get there, talk to him, tell me what I need to do?  I'm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Mom, what should I do, like a lawyer?  Yeah, you need a lawyer?  Well, he's been crying like a girl, too.  Well, I've got to get to the bottom of this. 
[00:24:00]  He's a very good person.  I've heard that before.  It's more of that bad parenting.  I've seen this before with these kids.  They're running around the streets like wild, and now they're selling drugs?  Did you know your son was doing this?  No, no.  Not to mention being found with the prostitute in the car in the combat zone?  What is that all about?  Don't even deny it, son.  Okay, please. 
[00:24:30]  He's already given a full confession before he even talked to a lawyer, which just shows how smart he is.  Okay, officer.  Son, Sonny.  I didn't know what to do.  Okay, officer.  Yes, ma'am.  Please help me, okay?  I'm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  I'm three hours away.  Please give me directions of how to get there and where you are, and I will be there.  Well, by that time, he's going to be transported out of here.  I'm not sure where they're taking him, but I'm sure which jail we do take him to, they're going to like him real good there tonight, if you know what I mean. 
[00:25:00]  He's pretty good looking.  Yeah, he better not drop that soap, if you know what I mean.  Please, sir.  I think Bubba's going to like him in the shower room, if you know what I mean, ma'am.  Listen, officer.  Yes, ma'am.  We...  You're a good family, blah, blah, blah.  I've heard it before, miss.  I've heard it before.  Okay, you've heard it before.  All right, all right.  Oh, he's had enough.  I can't let this go anymore. 
[00:25:30]  He's had enough.  Mom, you're on the radio.  Oh, my goodness.  Mom?  He couldn't take it anymore.  Mom?  What?  You're on the radio.  On what?  In Boston.  Huh?  It's a joke.  Oh, Jason.  Happy Mother's Day.  Happy Mother's Day, Mom.  Who is this?  This is Opie and Anthony from WAF.  We do a radio show in Boston.  Well, he is a good kid, but he's written out of the will.

[00:27:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh.  A little taste of corn got the light.  877-692-1027.  Toll-free number to get a hold of the radio program.  One of our buddies on the line, Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, Opie, what's going on there?  Hey, man.  Now, you know, you're starting a new market there.  The least you could do is do something that they would understand and appreciate.  Something Philadelphia would like, you know what I mean?  Like what, Paul?  Like what a Philly cheesesteak challenge. 
[00:27:30]  Shove them up there, those two mooses, and let some people from Philly come eat out the moose feet.  Oh.  You know, it's disgusting, but at least you'll involve Philadelphia.  Paul, we'll involve Philadelphia in time.  Okay.  Most of the people could care less when we're on the radio right now in Philadelphia.  All right.  You've got to win them over a little bit, and then you start doing things with them.  Yeah.  I want to correct one thing I said last week on your first day.  Yeah.  You asked me what turned you on to the show, and I said it was Anthony's voices.  That's wrong.  I have blocked out all the bad stuff you guys originally did. 
[00:28:00]  I think it's when you left me in a coffin that turned me on to your show.  Oh, that's right.  We did throw you in a coffin.  Damn.  All right.  Peace be with you, brothers, and good luck.  All right, Paul.  Paul, I got your phone call when you called our boss complaining about us.  Oh, here we go, Gene.  You got that?  Yeah.  I got to hear that.  I'm going to let you go, Paul, so I can play it.  All right?  Later.  That guy, for a lot of people in New York don't know this as well.  That guy hated us when we first came to New York.  He was, just about everyone hated us when we came to New York. 
[00:28:30]  He was just as bad, if not worse, than the people in Philly right now.  Right.  They were feeling the hatred toward the Opie and Anthony show, and that's fine, but when  we first came to New York, same thing.  And that guy, Paul, who's now a huge friend and fan of the show, hated us.  Hated.  To the point where he called up.  He called up to talk to our boss about having us removed from this station, just like the  people are doing in Philly.  But now, Tim, at WYSP, the program director down there, he's getting a lot of those calls. 
[00:29:00]  I'm sure this call...  Getting two a-holes off the air.  I'm sure Paul's call will sound very familiar to the staff over there at YSP right now.  See, the mistake Paul made, though, he called us instead of the boss's phone.  And who are we to tell him that he was talking to us?  So here's Paul when he hated us, Anthony.  Hello, N.E.W.?  Oh, yes.  Hi.  Is this the program director?  No.  Who's this?  Okay.  No, I just have a little bit of a complaint. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Who's this?  Well, no.  Hi.  My name's Paul.  The two gentlemen that are on the radio now...  Paul, I'm just an intern.  Let me get the program director you want?  Yeah, or somebody, please.  Okay.  Hold on a minute, please.  I just want you guys to...  Engineering.  Hi, Engineering.  How are you?  All right.  Could you guys do me a favor?  What's the...  What's the...  I'll give you guys a hundred bucks cash under the table to pull a plug on M2 Blabamout.  Come to play some music.  Oh, you want programming?  This is engineering, sir.  Oh, programming, please.  Oh, please hold.  Yeah, hello.  Hello.  Yeah, what's up? 
[00:30:00]  Hey, do me a favor.  I'll give somebody in programming, whoever it is, I'll give them like five hundred bucks  under the table to shut these guys up for a little while, play some music or something.  What are you talking about?  This is the jock lounge.  This is whose house?  Uh, the jock lounge.  Oh, the jock...  Oh.  Where the DJs hang before they go on the air.  Oh, no.  They keep...  They keep transferring me around.  I want to talk to somebody.  Um...  I mean, these...  These guys are a little bit ridiculous today.  You know, let them...  They call themselves disc jockeys.  Let them throw on some discs.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Something.  You want the PD or the general manager? 
[00:30:30]  Uh, I guess the program director would be fine.  I'm not here to bother the general manager.  Maintenance.  That's great.  You guys are great.  Okay.  Very funny.  That's pretty cool.  Maintenance.  But, yeah, you guys keep ping-ponging me around.  Is there any way to shut those two dudes up?  You want programming, sir?  Sure.  Why not?  I'll hang out and play the game.  Go for it.  Programming.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm trying to get...  I'm trying to talk to somebody to keep Tweedledum and Tweedledum and just a little bit quieter  and play some more tunes. 
[00:31:00]  Is that possible?  Who's Tweedledee and Tweedledum?  No.  Tweedledum and Tweedledum.  But them two yahoos you got blabbering on the radio, they sound like two old women  from Long Island.  Is there any way to keep them quiet, you two GJs, and just play a couple more tunes?  Is that possible?  So you're looking for programming?  I don't know who they got me looking for now.  Where am I?  Where do I get now?  I apologize.  We're having a problem with the phone system.  Can you hold on one last second?  Hey, no problem.  I'm cool.  All right.  Hold on.  You've reached 1-900 Suck My G**k on Gay Male Sex. 
[00:31:30]  If you like big fists up your a**, stay on the line.  You'll get a hot a** right in your mouth to blow a** all over that face of yours.  Didn't that sound a lot like the callers from Philly?  Sure did.  You've reached Hot G**k. 
[00:32:00]  I'm Big Dick Black.  Yes.  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, as much as I hate you two guys, but I'm sorry to have a little change of heart.  You guys are pretty funny yesterday.  I really hate you, guys.  Well, thanks.  It was a very, very funny show yesterday.  It's only been three days.  Give us time.  No, I'm having a change of heart.  That, uh, Jay Moore and, uh, who's that other guy?  Norton?  Jim Norton's great.  Yeah, those two guys are a pitcher, man.  Oh, cool.  Are you guys coming to Philly anytime soon? 
[00:32:30]  Are we coming to Philly anytime soon?  We might hang out, so.  We might show up for Babe Fest.  All right, can you send Black Earl up for us?  Uh, we can do that.  We can take care of him really, really well up here.  We're going to, like, send Earl out first to see, uh, how you guys handle him.  Oh, no, we'll show him some brotherly love.  You sure?  Yeah, take him outside to, like, South Philly or something.  I'm leaving there.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something about Earl.  I mean, uh, our listeners in New York absolutely love us, and they still hate Earl.  Yeah.  So, could you imagine if we sent Earl down to Philly now?  Oh, no. 
[00:33:00]  To scout him out for us?  We'll take really good, good care of him.  All right, we'll figure it out.  Uh, wait, one more question.  Yeah, no, we'll be at Babe Fest, though.  I mean, no one's really going to care, but we're going to show up and, uh, see what's  going on with that.  When are you guys starting out that webcam thing?  Huh?  That camera thing on the web.  Uh, we crashed it yesterday, so we got to get a better system.  They're working on it.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, you guys get in there.  All right, thank you.  Thanks, man.  That's one thing we pride ourselves on, is, uh, when we have things going on here in  the, in the studio, we put it on the camera, so everybody can, can watch on the, uh, on 
[00:33:30]  the web.  Right.  But they have to upgrade the system.  Speaking of Earl, tomorrow, he's doing a WOW sticker stop at Toyota of Hackensack, 278  River Street, Hackensack, New Jersey.  Earl's going to be there at four, and the camera's from, uh, ABC TV.  Yeah.  2020 downtown.  We'll be on, on site to, um, interview our listeners for a piece they're doing.  Taping a little segment for a piece they're doing on, uh, your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, so they asked us, uh, is there anywhere where your listeners hang to listen to the 
[00:34:00]  show?  Like, no, not really.  Not as a group, but we are doing the sticker stop.  Bellevue, maybe.  So, uh.  Mental institutions.  So, if you want to be on TV, show up at that sticker stop tomorrow.  It's going to be amazing.  So, you're Earl?  Yes.  All right.  Great segment.  Oh, please don't get Earl on this piece.  Oh, they will.  Oh.  I just say to the listeners, make it real interesting for the camera crew. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, can someone bring a bunch of hot girls down there so they don't have to interview Earl?  Wowing.  Wowing and stuff.  All they can get of Earl doing is taking his hat off and rubbing his head going, yes.  Looking down.  That's all they'll get of him.  Either that or cursing out listeners.  Yeah.  Did you hear about that, too?  Yeah, we heard about that.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm calling from Philly.  So far, I like what I'm hearing.  Oh, thanks, Eric.  Eric, but I wanted to, are you guys going to let Philly people come up and make asses 
[00:35:00]  of themselves, too?  Definitely.  You guys are in our backyard.  Because, like, I'm down for that, you know?  Anything for some cash, I'll make an ass out of myself.  I'll tell you, Eric, Philadelphia is a very important market for us.  I mean, we're going to be all over the country, but Philadelphia, you guys are in our backyard.  Of course you guys are going to participate.  Okay.  That's cool.  I mean, like, I'm a big radio fan.  I don't even watch much TV.  Like, I listen to Howard every morning and everything.  Like, I'm a talk radio junkie.  Right on.  Did you hear this is good junk?  What's that?  We're good junk.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:35:30]  But, like, I just said, I completely lost track of what I was going to say.  All right.  At least you guys are cool, and welcome to the city.  Hey, thank you, man.  I appreciate that.  All right.  Speaking of radio.  Yep.  Yeah.  See what Imus said about us in the paper today?  Yeah.  Imus is on the fan here in New York.  He's all over it.  Yeah, he's all over the country.  Obviously, everyone knows who Don Imus is.  But he had a little problem with one of the people he had just hired for his show. 
[00:36:00]  A friend of ours.  A friend of ours.  He came from the morning show on this station, on WNAW.  Sid Rosenberg.  Sid.  Who's their sports guy over there on the Imus in the Morning program.  And he said something that got him fired for a couple of days.  I hear tell that they hired him back.  Is that what happened?  Yes.  You know, Imus made Sid pretty much grovel for his job today.  Grovel for his job?  This is Imus we're talking about.  Yeah.  Who has said some major racist things on his radio show. 
[00:36:30]  But he says it's okay because it's always in the proper context.  Well, he used the old line because he uses characters.  Mr. Amus uses characters.  So, yeah, Sid, he had some offensive remarks about Venus and Serena Williams.  You know, the tennis gals said that they were animals.  And somebody brought up that they might be in Playboy or they would be offered a spread in Playboy. 
[00:37:00]  And he said, maybe National Geographic, but not Playboy.  So, they were deemed racist remarks.  He was fired from the Imus in the Morning show.  He had a comeback yesterday.  And, like Opie said, pretty much groveled in front of Imus.  Well, today.  Today was a big day.  Oh, today?  This morning was it?  Yeah.  It was pretty pathetic.  He had a kiss at Imus' ass and everyone else's ass.  I understand why Sid went through it.  But, come on, Don.  But this is the climate of the Imus in the Morning show. 
[00:37:30]  I mean, they have some quotes here from Bo Deedle,  who was suspended at least once on the air for comments.  He said, 1999, that the guerrilla special effects in the movie Instinct  reminded him of the Knicks lineup.  That's what he said.  Jesus Christ.  And, of course, what else?  Yeah, Bernard McGurk.  Bernard, jerk.  Mentioned in the same paragraph.  Did not make the guerrilla comment. 
[00:38:00]  His analysis of the Knicks runs more toward chest bumping pimps.  That's what he called them.  Chest bumping pimps.  So, when Sid said the remarks about Venus and Serena, they fired him.  And he's just like, wait a minute.  I'm on this show.  I'm hearing what's going on.  I say these remarks and I get fired.  And then they kind of backpedaled and said, you know, he's been on this show for not very long  and maybe he should have eased into it before he says remarks like that. 
[00:38:30]  And then they gave him his job back.  But Imus then commenting on the whole thing.  I was watching Imus this morning because of this whole thing.  Yeah.  You know, he's doing the oxygen thing again.  Is he on the oxygen again?  It is.  Don, if you've got to do the oxygen before you go back on the air, you know, make sure you're  not on camera.  I, um, I had pneumonia.  And, uh, now I, um, uh, need the, uh, oxygen.  But I had the tank under my big fag cowboy hat. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, jerk.  That's good.  I, I got a, um, uh, high voltage, um, paddles here to restart my heart.  Now, Sid, uh, I want you to bend down in front of Imus and just start sucking.  Yeah, yeah.  Suck for your job, baby.  Every day on the radio, you hear awful racist things, far worse than anything, uh, we do. 
[00:39:30]  Imus said.  But, uh, most shows aren't having, uh, Senator John McCain on.  So we have to meet a higher standard.  Yeah, yeah, baby.  And we accept that.  We aren't Opie and Anthony.  That's what he said.  He said, because they have, like, John McCain on them, that they have to watch what they say. 
[00:40:00]  What a pussy.  You say whatever you want.  All right, he's got to, you know.  It's all in the context of fun and hijinks.  He's got to impress his friends in Washington now.  Uh, Sid, I'm going to, uh, cover my junk in my brother's salsa.  Now, I want you to start, uh, licking.  Here, here, lick it.  Lick it, Sid.  Lick for your job.  McGurk, take his back door.  Lewis.  Hey, dude.  Firstly, congratulations on the syndication. 
[00:40:30]  It's long overdue.  Hey, thanks, Lewis.  Uh, just one thing.  You guys, or should I say many people may hate Howard for all they hate him.  But let me tell you something.  This Imus is the biggest lowlife.  He walked around the halls of NBC.  NBC!  20 years ago, calling people the N-word.  Yeah.  And suddenly, suddenly, Mr., you know, Mr. Perfect over here, the hypocrite, is talking about, you know, he has a show that he does characters. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  You know, he's so innocent, suddenly.  Well, when your lungs collapse, um, you start, uh, thinking about, um, your death and, uh, maybe, um, not, um, uh, what the hell was I saying?  Oh, spit it out, Don.  3.53, Imus in the morning.  Quack, quack, quack.  Quack, quack, quack.  Jerk, shut up.  That's my quack, you quack, quack, jerk, moron, leather neck, jackass.  All right, Lewis, thank you.  Talk to you later. 
[00:41:30]  Doesn't my neck look like saddlebags?  Lewis, you stupid idiot, jerk.  Guy's just a moron.  Yeah, baby, I use characters.  Here's one that's called the Grease Man.  So there you have it.  What a doodle-y.  There you have it.  He's not, his show's not Opie and Anthony.  That's what he said.  He goes, we are an Opie and Anthony.  That's for sure.  Yeah, we're funny.  I wish we could get John McCain, though. 
[00:42:00]  How would we ever do it to John McCain?  Nothing, thank God.  3.54, I'm us in the morning.  Quack, quack.  Oh, shut up, jerk.  That's all he does.  He calls people's jerks.  And then he loved that whole thing.  Please.  He loves the little boost he gets from Sid making a supposed racist remark.  They played it for all it's worth today.  Sid's going to toss my salad now. 
[00:42:30]  Baby, toss away, baby.  Move it, worm.  Coming to get you.  All right, we've got to take a break.  I'm hearing some bad news on line eight.  What?  Let me see if this is true.  David, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Don West got let go by a shop at home.  Why?  No way.  I don't know why, but it's true.  How can you prove it?  Is it on the website or something?  An email from their website says he's not there anymore.  He hasn't been on for weeks. 
[00:43:00]  Let me see.  Hold on.  I can't accept this.  I cannot accept this.  All right, David, we'll check on it, and if it's true, we'll have to break out some of the Don West stuff.  Okay.  All right, thanks, David.  Shop at Home.  Maybe it's Shop at Home.  I think I saw it the other day.  Shop at Home.  And as you do that, I'm going to play Stephen Lynch.  All right.  Another ditty from Stephen.  People digging the Stephen Lynch songs, and we'll be back.  This is a song that I wrote, actually, a couple days ago after, excuse me, a friend of mine, my best friend, we went out to a bar, and we got really hammered. 
[00:43:30]  And we just had a really good time, and I realized, you know, why not write a song about the good times that you have with your pal when you're out drinking at night?  You know what I mean?  And so I wrote this for my best friend, my friend.  That should be cute.  I'm going to play that now.  I hope he's listening.  If you are, man, this one's for you. 
[00:44:00]  Here we are, dear old friend.  You and I, drunk again, laughs have been hand, tears have been shed, maybe the whiskey's gone to my hand.  But if I were gay, I would give you my heart.  And if I were gay, you'd be my work of art. 
[00:44:30]  And if I were gay, we would swim in romance.  But I'm not gay, so get your hand out of my pants.  It's not that I don't care, I do.  I just don't see myself in you.  Another time, another scene, I'd be right behind you, if you know what I mean. 
[00:45:00]  Because if I were gay, I would give you my soul.  And if I were gay, I would give you my whole being.  And if I were gay, we would tear down the walls.  But I'm not gay, so won't you stop cupping my hand.  It's radio, you know.  We've never hugged, we've never kissed. 
[00:45:30]  I've never been intimate with your fist.  But you have opened brand new doors.  Get over here and drop your trash.  I'm not gay, I'm not gay, I'm not gay, I'm not gay. 
[00:46:00]  You know, this past weekend's been great.  Couldn't get my lunch in the refrigerator.  Of course not.  Of course not.  It's full of Sam Adams. 
[00:46:30]  You know what I had in my fridge over the weekend?  Nice hot weekend that we had?  Ice cold Sam Adams summer ale.  Oh, oh, so nice.  If you're not into the lager for the day, you know, maybe it's a little heavier than you kind of want.  You drink the summer ale.  Nice, cool, refreshing summer ale.  See, we do these spots early in the show.  We do these goddamn spots early in the show, and I need a goddamn beer.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, but see, this is how it works, Anthony.  Yeah.  You're allowed to have one now.  Because we're doing the read.  Right.  Could someone grab me an ice cold Sam Adams summer ale?  Preferably the one that Mendy didn't, Mendy, oh, not the one that Mendy made disappear.  She took an entire bottle.  It was amazing.  Nothing was sticking out but the part that holds the bottle cap.  It's like my great-grandfather used to say, how much could she put in there?

[00:48:00]  Good morning.  Good morning to you, Arnold.  No problemo.  We're going to have to play our Arnold prank calls in a little while.  Now we're having fun.  On the way, Sandy Kane.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  A mess of a woman.  I don't believe it.  Can we play her song from her cable access show?  How do we even explain the cable access show that she sent us?  She's got a cable access show, Sandy Kane.  She's just this ridiculous old woman that takes her clothes off. 
[00:48:30]  And she's really hard to look at.  And she does a cable access show.  And it's just her on camera in front of, I guess, a blue screen with video of her in the background.  Now, ridiculous.  And she's getting naked and showing parts of her body.  And it's just horrific.  Just when you thought this show was ridiculous, you tune that in.  That's really ridiculous.  Now, what's the name of the song that she performed on this cable access show?  This is her rendition of Heartbreak Hotel. 
[00:49:00]  Ah, ah, ah.  Heartbreak Hotel, yes.  And just for the dumb guy, just so he knows, it's a song about her husband named Dick.  Oh.  Don't worry.  I'll write through it and get this.  That trick never works.  That'll dig.  All right, we'll give it a shot.  See what happens.  Sandy Kane from our cable access show.  Ooh.  Just for you folks.  I know.  Oh, this is a very sad story. 
[00:49:30]  Get a tissue.  Tissue.  Tissue, I don't even know you.  The guy sitting in the front of the meeting, could you come a little bit closer?  You have a very big t***.  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  Since my husband, Dick, left me for a guy, I went to Heartbreak Hotel to commit suicide.  What?  I was so lonely.  I was so lonely. 
[00:50:00]  I was so lonely.  I could die, I could die.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  When my husband, Dick, he left me for a boy.  I took a walk to Heartbreak Hotel to commit suicide.  I'll tell you.  I was so lonely.  I was so lonely.  I was so lonely.  I could die, I swear to God.  I'm getting sick.  The window, it was open. 
[00:50:30]  I was going to jump, but ooh.  My mother's face appeared before me, and she's ashamed to lay up.  I'll kill you.  I said, Mommy, I am so lonely.  Turn it off.  I am so lonely.  I could die.  Turn it off.  Yeah, I never forget that night.  I came home from my...  Turn it off.  I was taking my top off.  Showing my double D s*** at the big top. 
[00:51:00]  I came home all the time.  Turn it off.  I love when he's about to die.  That's horrible.  That is horrible.  That's the best thing that was on that tape.  Wow.  She is the worst.  Well, she's coming in so we can poke her and stuff.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I've been listening to you guys for two days now. 
[00:51:30]  So far, not too much funny stuff.  You didn't have fun yesterday?  It was a little dull.  It was a little dull.  What's up with all the gay stuff?  You guys Moe's or something?  Yeah, we're Moe's.  That's it, Mike.  Flaming.  Flaming homosexuals, Mike.  There you go.  Flaming is, to say the least, you guys are Moe's.  Oh, Moe's.  You're not enjoying the show yet, Mike?  No.  Listen, I will do this.  I'll listen to it for the rest of the week because basically it's the only station that comes in.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you so much for giving it a chance. 
[00:52:00]  I'll call you back.  You want the report next week?  Thank you.  He didn't like the homo stuff, I guess.  All the little references.  Maybe Gay Marco upset him.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Two days.  Two days.  Give us a chance.  My God.  Get your balls out.  Slap your ass up.  Slap your scrotum.  It's today.  Now it may not be anyone's birthday.  And it's not even 4th of July. 
[00:52:30]  Hey.  That's gay.  That's for you, Mike.  That's gay.  See, if we have to gauge gay, that's gay.  That's gay.  Oh, man.  You can't just throw that word around.  Howdy, faggot.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, listen.  I had the ice pick in my ear.  I was going to dig out my eardrum.  Turn that woman off, please.  Yeah, well, you should have watched the rest of the show like we did. 
[00:53:00]  It was just beyond horror.  It was a horror.  You know, I'm glad you guys got syndicated, but I don't know.  Yesterday you had the two fat whales with the Motley Crue Challenge, and today you got  Sandy Cain.  Where's the lesbian, you know, teens and everything else that's supposed to go on?  We will get another teen party.  Don't worry about it.  You know, I remember one time you guys had, like, teen pajama party.  We're going to get another teen thing going very soon, don't you worry.  T-shirt contest, maybe, you know?  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  All right.  You guys will, man.  All right.  Teen girl. 
[00:53:30]  Anthony, it's being reported that, yeah, Don West is out.  Opie, I'm floored here.  I got the official announcement.  Don West has left the employment of Shop at Home.  He worked hard for Shop at Home for eight years, made substantial contributions to the company,  However, it was a mutual decision that he should pursue other opportunities at this point in his career,  and we wish him well in future endeavors.  He's gone.  Don West from the Home Shopping Network, gone. 
[00:54:00]  You remember the guy?  I mean, you shop at home, you turn it on at night, and he's just yelling about various baseball cards and sports memorabilia.  He loves those.  He just loses mind.  He loves those Mark McGuire rookie cards.  Making it sound like it's the best deal ever.  Right.  You're going to love this, people.  You're going to love it.  We got McGuire and Sosa rookie cards.

The night he was selling virgins.  Ah, yes. 
[00:55:00]  Who knew?  This was at like 3 in the morning.  Yeah.  Don West selling virgins on the Home Shopping Network.  What do you think the QVC guy sounds like selling virgins?  Or...  We talked about the guys from QVC before.  They're always selling the Beanie Babies and memorabilia sports stuff.  Yeah, they have the tough sounding voices.  One guy yelling all the time, virgins, 22-year-old virgins, order now. 
[00:55:30]  These are going to go fast.  Look at this one.  Let's bring it up.  Let's open her up.  We like to do this every so often.  You're not going to find anything better than this, people.  Limited time, and you get a Mark McGuire rookie card with everyone.  22-year-old virgin, McGuire rookie card.  We're giving them away $22. 
[00:56:00]  That's a dollar a year.  22-year-old virgins.  Look, I can't get anything in here.  We're talking, you won't be able to tell the difference between the front or the back.  It's like two balloon knots.  Wow, what the hell?  And you get Flopsy Wopsy, the Beanie Baby, that's been discontinued since 92.  A McGuire rookie card, a Sosa rookie card. 
[00:56:30]  And a 22-year-old virgin.  They're going to go fast, people.  Look, I'm trying.  I can't get anything in here.  Take it home.  Work it.  Limited edition.  Did you hear?  Limited edition.  For the love of God.  So there he was selling the virgins. 
[00:57:00]  And now you're saying he's out of a job, Anthony.  He's out of a job.  I don't know what the hell he's doing.  He was the star of that show.  I loved watching that.  Three in the morning, you could turn it on and just watch him yelling and his head turning red.  You're not going to believe the deals.  The deals you're getting here tonight.  This right here, the package we got here for you now,  is the bestest deal you're ever going to see on this program.  The bestest deal.  The bestest deal. 
[00:57:30]  The end of three minutes on the clock.  Then when the three minutes run out?  Oh, if you like that one, you're a complete a-hole.  Because the one's coming up.  You should have saved your money because you threw it away on the last one.  This is by far the greatest.  You're ever going to see.  And do the flex of the stretch pay.  You could put this on stretch pay.  You'll be paying these cards off until you're named.  But you'll have them.

If they press them out, why do they got to make it look like they had ribs in them?  They just bowled them.  Be driving around, people.  You know, maybe Don West will have to work the subways, Anthony, for some loose change in between jobs.  We've seen all those guys. 
[01:01:30]  Be putting money in my head, people.  I don't do anything.  I don't play music.  I don't sing.  I don't even bang on the goddamn spackle buckets.

He'll pop up somewhere else.  Alex, what's going on?  You guys are killing me over here.  How are they not liking this in Philly?  If they don't like that, what can I tell you?  It's gold.  That's classic stuff from Anthony right there.  Do you guys still have that old Britney Spears one laying around? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, do we?  Someone was selling.  What were they selling?  I think they were selling Britney Spears' virginity.  Someone put Britney Spears' virginity up on eBay.  On eBay, yeah.  And we thought it would be pretty funny if Don West had a chance to try to sell Britney Spears' virginity.  That could be a little bit to play today.  Sure.  You guys are great.  All right, man.  That was funny, Anthony.  Lindsay, what's going on?  I'm a big fan of the guy.  I'm from Philly, and, like, I don't know what everybody's problem is. 
[01:05:30]  I think they're just shitty because their sisters suck.  I mean, I don't know what their problem is.  Alex, I'm sorry.  Watch out for the S word.  Funny as S, hopefully, yeah?  How old a girl are you?  18.  A teen.  Oh, my God.  Our first teen from Philly.  Woo!  Philly teens.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, my God.  We love our teen girls.  But you guys are funny.  I don't know what everybody's problem is.  And you're a teen.  Yeah, Lindsay, can we get you to New York? 
[01:06:00]  Can I get you where?  Can we get you to New York?  Can you get on a bus?  When we have a teen party, would you like to be in here?  How about...  Oh, my God.  I was listening to you yesterday.  That was disgusting.  Well, yeah, we'll agree with that.  Well, yeah.  That was really sick.  I was, like, throwing up.  Lindsay, you have a nice body?  Sure.  Would you like to be the first person from Philly to visit us in the studio here in New York?  What?  When?  We'll foul you and send you back. 
[01:06:30]  Oh.  Oh, God.  You're going to reen it, Opie.  Well, she's 18.  What does your little 18-year-old body look like?  I'm not telling you.  Hey, come on.  We share on this show.  We share on this show?  I want to share something to me.  Yeah.  You deal with it, though.  You deal with that laugh.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  All right, Lindsay.  Well, thank you.  Can I say hi to somebody that lives in New York that I haven't talked to?  No.  He hates me.  No. 
[01:07:00]  Wait, you want to say hi to someone in New York?  Well, he's mean.  He hates me.  All right.  Go ahead.  His name is Keith.  Ah.  You're terrible.  She just wanted to say hi.  I had something happen with the phone.  Sue, what's going on?  Hey, Anthony, you are the biggest comic genius I have ever heard in my life.  You guys are shocked.  I wouldn't put me...  No, you're great.  You are the best.  No, that was huge right there.  He's just a jackass and watches too much goddamn television.  You make my afternoon.  Every day I come home, I have to quick put on the radio. 
[01:07:30]  My kids think I'm a nut.  I have a 15-year-old who thinks he's got the coolest mom.  He sits here and we listen.  That's bonding, mother and son style.  Now, Sue, how old is your son?  15.  Because we're going to do a new contest very, very soon.  Oh, really?  You could be the first contestant.  Really?  We want to have a contest.  Moms, we'd like to F.  Oh, please.  I'm totally serious.  I'll be there.  I mean, we're going to get a nice prize.  The moms come down and show off what they got. 
[01:08:00]  And the listeners will vote for the hottest mom we'd like to F.  Oh, I'm definitely there.  All right.  Hold on.  Definitely there.  Hold on.  You're the first one.  We'll get cold, hard cash and other prizes.  We'll put all the moms on the website and everyone will vote for their hottest mom.  Hot teen moms.  We'll get the moms.  I can't say teen in that.  We'll get the moms in all sorts of outfits, right?  Yeah.  We have Backstreet Boys tickets.  How did we get those?  How did we get Backstreet Boys tickets?  Stockbroker Dave. 
[01:08:30]  I'm in.  You're in?  You'll get some money or what?  Cash.  You could have used it yesterday, Dave.  Yeah.  I heard.  I was out.  I had to go to the ATM and pay Stinky back.  How sad is that that Stinky had to front the money for the two big fat chicks yesterday  to do the Motley Crue Challenge.  Oh, man.  I had to go to the ATM and take out money.  I know.  I still owe him $100.  I have to give it to him after the show.  Oh, man.  How does it look?  He better keep reminding you.  See, Dave, you think we really care about you, but we were just hoping for your cold, 
[01:09:00]  hard cash yesterday.  I got no problem with that.  All right.  I got no problem.  I'll put up cash for the hot moms.  Yeah.  We're going to do a contest.  Moms, we'd like to F.  We're going to do that very soon.  Does anybody get to F?  You never know.  You never know.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right, Dave.  Be well, boys.  Everything else all right with you?  Cool as usual.  How about you?  How's the market, Dave?  Sucks.  Sucks, huh?  Sucks.  Actually, I did okay today.  It was down $130 and it finished up. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  But there's no volume.  It was quiet.  Yeah.  All right.  No money this month.  Well, come see us soon.  All right, boys.  Be well.  All right.  There you go.  Stock broker, Dave.  Rick, what do we got in CD4?  Is that the Britney Spears thing?  Yeah.  That's a QVC guy.  We'll close out our little memorial to Don West, who's looking for a job now.  I can't wait to see where he ends up.  The guy, I heard in an interview with him, he really wants to be a sports guest.  That's what he wants to do.  I think he'd be pretty good.  ESPN.  ESPN. 
[01:10:00]  He would fit right in with you.  It'd be crazy.  They all try to get louder than the next guy.  And we got a new Don West bit to play over and over again on this radio show.  You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  Boo-yah!  All right, we'll finish up the tribute to Don West with the Britney Spears thing.  Trying to sell Britney Spears virginity.  One time only, there's only one of a kind.  Once the hymen's broken, it can't be brought back, people. 
[01:10:30]  Nineteen years old.  Nineteen.  This is tighter than a number two pencil, people.  You'd have trouble edging in a number two pencil.  She's like a pencil sharpener.  We're talking nineteen-year-old virgin.  Be dialing.  Let's look at this one close up.  Let me open it up for you.  Take a look.  Take your heart. 
[01:11:00]  Unbelievable.  I can't even fit in a McGuire rookie card.  Look how tight it is.  Eleven million dollars, people.  Be dialing.  See my phone.  And a rookie card from Sosa.  Look at it.  Sammy Sosa rookie card.  Look, I can't even get a knuckle in.  And I wouldn't try it because it'd ruin it for you.  You're paying.  You get to open it. 
[01:11:30]  Unopened Britney Spears, people.  Be dialing.  We don't usually get nineteen-year-old virgins on the program.  Usually, it's smelly baseball cards and bubblegum.  I did it again.  I did it again.  I did it again.  I did it again.  I did it again.  Look at it here, people.  I'm trying to insert a Ken Griffey Jr. rookie card.  It ain't going in.  Just think of the pleasure you're going to get plowing this hose back. 
[01:12:00]  I'm not that animal.  Order now.  And you get the Olsen twin.  When available.  Unbelievable.  Be dialing.  Dyson's going to do a song with Britney.  Oops, look what I did to you again.  Just think of what anal's going to be like.  I can barely keep it in my pants just looking at it. 
[01:12:30]  I'm ready to file this package.  Call now, people.  One of a kind.  Listen to her sing.  Just imagine ramming it home when she's singing this one.  Be dialed.  All right, I can't take it.  I've got to take it myself.  It's off the market. 
[01:13:00]  Look.  Look, I'm banging this hose bag on national television.  Look, get my buddy over here.  You can get in there.  Look, I'll loop it.  Here we go.  Go to town.  John from Lennon, New Jersey.  Hey, guys, apparently Stockbroker Dave has moved on to bigger and better things  than wins Stockbroker Dave's money.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's offering 11 mil.  That's an obscure reference, and we like it. 
[01:13:30]  Yankee Bleacher, Anthony checking in from New York.  Britney Spears is a virgin, and Spaz is intelligent and bright.  All right, there you have it.  Our tribute to Don West is out of a job today.  I forgot he took it off the market after he lubed it up with spit and banged it himself.  Hello, Philly.  Hey, Anthony, Dan from Hoboken?  Yes.  Oh, we just had that lovely Teen Lindsey from Philly on the air.  She's got to call the show back.  We didn't mean to hang up on her.  Dan from Hoboken, right? 
[01:14:00]  If New York City gets Teen Lindsey from Philly, then we will finally have revenge for the Lenny  Dijkstra or Roger McDowell's ring.  Very good, Dan.

Yeah, how you doing?  I need your opinion on something  Seriously  Yeah, okay  I'm in my mid-40s  Okay, married  But marriage is pretty much on the rocks now  I met this girl 19 years old  Well, she just turned 18 last year  On the internet 
[01:30:00]  And we met, got together  And we started seeing each other  You started having sex  That's the other way to put it, yeah  Right?  And I'm going to tell you  Like a 19-year-old  I mean, 18-year-old, 19  I mean, they're really willing to please  If you know what I mean  And they're really into it  Yeah  The only problem is the maturity isn't there  You know what I mean?  It's like you're hanging out with a kid  Who cares?  That's the other thing  I'm thinking, who cares?  But you know what I mean?  It's like she started getting attached  At first we thought 
[01:30:30]  It was just going to be for straight sex  But then she starts beeping me  And calling me  And talking to me  More like friends type of thing  It's getting a little bit more  Heavier in that thing  In fact, we stopped for a while  Because I felt she was getting  A little too clinging  And still, it gets back to that  She's 19 now  Are you going to take her to the prom?  No, I don't think so  She's in college already  You know what happens  If you totally break it off of her  Though she calls your wife, man  It's all over, Johnny  No, she can't  She can't do that  She only has a beeper number 
[01:31:00]  Has she shown up at your house yet?  No, no  Like that scene in Goodfellas?  No, no  Because when I meet  It's usually someplace else  I even park my car  A block or two away  And, you know, walk over  Joey Butterfuoco gave me this shirt  I mean, in fact  In fact, she wants to meet up  With me tomorrow  And, you know  Every couple of weeks  We keep saying about meeting  And then right before we meet  I back out  I keep saying  Oh, I'm busy at work  And stuff like that  So you want to  I don't know  It's a weird thing  You know  You want to  I mean  It's 19-year-old sex  For God's sake 
[01:31:30]  And she's got a wood flaw  In the end  You're going to get screwed  So it's up to you  Yeah  You can enjoy the ride  Until you get screwed  Or try to break it off  And see what happens  Yeah, I don't know  I don't know  I think if the divorce  Does go through  In a few months  Then I guess  I don't want to throw it away  All right  Thank you, Dave  Thanks, buddy  Marriage is over  The marriage is over  He's not going to go back  And grab on to  Grab on to that wife's ass  When he had that snare drum  Boom, boom, boom  He had that  The girl's got the ass

[02:03:00]  mic around a little bit. Now take a look. Watch this, Ben. Watch this reaction. Ben's going to  throw up. Ben's gagging. Ben's gagging. You want to touch it, Ben? No, I don't. Why not? Go ahead.  Oh my God. Look at it. Look at it from this side, homie. It's my body, man. It's hanging. Now I'm  realizing it's hanging from a nub that's about the size of a pencil, and then the rest of it 
[02:03:30]  spreads out like a mushroom. She's got a big... It's like a baby, like little baby fingers. It's  like a baby hand with the fingers kind of clenched. What would happen if you pull on it real hard?  No! Stop it! Ow! She's pulling on it! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! It's a baby's head. I can't  take any more of it. Maybe it was my abortion.

[02:04:00]  Sandy, you need to go see an ear, nose, throat, spectrum. Anyone else want to see this in the  building? Come on down. Come on down. Sandy, that's not from shaving. No, okay. Andy, you're  pretty smart. I can't accept that. Okay. Maybe it was from something else. A cut from shaving  would be a scar. That's something that's growing. All of a sudden, one day I woke up and it was  there. Sandy, we like to joke, obviously, but that is not from shaving. You've got to have  that checked out. That is not from shaving. Oh, please. Cut it off. How many years have you 
[02:04:30]  had that? Is that 15? 15 years. Cut it off. Hey, can we get... Sell it on eBay. I like  it, man. What would the show be without it now? How do you like that? When was the last  time, honestly, you were with a man? Be honest. When was the last time you were with a man?  Well, I was in the back of a VIP room with his right hands and my breast. But when was the  last time a man was in that area? How long? Has it been more than 15 years? What, you 
[02:05:00]  think if a man liked me, he wouldn't have... I'm thinking the surprise on his face when  he takes down those panties as he's figuring he's going to maybe pleasure you a little bit  and goes, holy smoke, there's an air valve down here or something. I mean, I don't think  it would matter to a man. I have... As a man, it would matter. No, I have... Sandy,  we've seen some things. We've seen some things. Completely stripped? Yes. And do people just  go, what is that? Not really. How do... What are they... What are they, blind? Can we get 
[02:05:30]  a picture for the website? We have to share. We're going to take a picture. We did? We got  a digital picture? Did Scott run down the mall with it? Ripley, believe it or not, I hope  my mother's listening. Everyone right now looks like, in this room, like they've been through  a battle. Mine, you're listening in Jersey? Well... Everyone has been through a battle. Sandy, that  is amazing. Yeah, thanks. I mean, so you think a guy would say, oh, forget it, I'm not going  to touch it. Do you want to... Let me... I wouldn't know what that was. Let me make a proposition,  because I miss the freak shows. Would you like to make a lot of money? We will show that 
[02:06:00]  to whoever wants to see it. We'll have a line around the building, Anthony. Oh, oh, do you  want to get the woman's point of view here? Yes. I wasn't paying attention. Wait, get on that,  Mike. Wait, get on that Mike. That Mike works. Allison, right? Yeah. Allison, who won our  best ass contest. Best ass contest. She's had some really nice lingerie, so I'm calming  down. She's perfect. Have you seen a lot of women's intimate areas? Well, not up close 
[02:06:30]  and personal, like, you know. No? I mean, I've seen. In your years, have you seen it? Oh,  yes. Yeah. And you know what normal ones look like, and... Oh, my blood pressure's coming  back to normal. You've got to look at this and tell me if you've ever seen anything like  this on any of your women's friends. Yeah. Move the mic over here. No, you have to look.  We need a female point of view on this, because I... Explain as a woman what the F this is.  All right? I don't know. Well, no doctor. Well, as a woman. Thank God. Thank God. Yeah, 
[02:07:00]  because those doctors... Okay, this is it. What is that? Not from shaving. Right. Thank  you. I can tell you that. So look on people's faces when they see it for the first time.  Isn't it classic? One day it was there. It was just one day it was there. That could  be removed easily. That's really... Really? Let's do it now. It's a large skin tag. Ben,  bite it off. Yeah. Oh! Oh, God. No, I want to make a lot of money. He'd say he wants to 
[02:07:30]  show it on the web. Okay. No, here's the deal. All right. We will allow people to come  down and take a look at this thing. Sweet, merciful crap! Yeah. Oh, yeah. Don't you wish  you had one? We have an hour left in the show. Well, let's get a little collection for Sandy  Kane. If you're in the area and you want to see what's in Sandy's pants.

[02:39:30]  were actually able to get syndicated after that xfl game day debacle i i i guess they didn't know  about it are you back to uh admitting that you are the producer of that show absolutely you know  i was talking about the other day we could have done a nice safe show with bruce beck and rusty  tillman sitting down in sterile studio yeah and it would have been safe but you know what i'm glad  we took the chance we should but we should brag to joseph gordon levitt we were uh tv stars oh yeah  just like we had just like you we had to run very close to third rock from the sun for four weeks 
[02:40:00]  how many years did you last six six we lasted four episodes that's magnificent man that's magnificent  you know we figured we'd uh we just give it all right at the beginning instead of having to  stretch it out over six years some guys last a couple weeks some guys last six years  i'm just kind of bummed we didn't get to do the special episode yeah the very special episode  this one episode he has motto i was looking forward to the christmas special myself but
