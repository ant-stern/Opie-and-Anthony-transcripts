<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton (though Norton is later mentioned as being in Los Angeles), engaging in vulgar and sexually suggestive banter.  Significant time is spent complaining about technical difficulties, particularly with the "pal talk" cameras and microphones, blaming staff for "fiddling" with their equipment across different studios.  They then discuss a letter from New York Councilman John Liu criticizing Rosie O'Donnell for mocking Chinese speech, a criticism the hosts vehemently disagree with, responding with offensive ethnic stereotypes and jokes. This leads to a broader discussion on political correctness and humor.

The show moves on to a review of Mel Gibson's *Apocalypto*, criticizing its violence and the need for subtitles, and lambasting Cindy Adams' negative review due to her lack of viewing the film.  Various news stories are covered, including a rabbi's attempt to remove Christmas trees from a Seattle airport, a Chicago shooting over a toilet patent, and protests in Detroit suburbs against Victoria's Secret G-string mannequins.  The hosts also discuss the proliferation of "how-to-steal" videos on YouTube and the ease of accessing information on illegal activities online, mentioning Sonny's Pest Poker, an online poker game available to listeners.  The show promotes upcoming segments like the Eggnog Challenge and the Homeless Shopping Spree, and Danny, a producer, plugs Bill Burr's upcoming show, mentioning its potentially NSFW title.

The discussion about readily available information on illegal activities online continues with caller participation, focusing on the responsibility of websites like YouTube.  Callers then share internet-learned methods for petty scams and pranks, such as manipulating vending machines and change machines.  A MacBook karaoke contest follows, featuring listener submissions, with Ryan Crewer winning for his rendition of "Livin' on a Prayer," while Miriam Ferrara receives harsh criticism. More listener-submitted "life hacks," including elevator manipulation and free soda acquisition, are shared, alongside further mocking of the Victoria's Secret protestor in Detroit.

The show shifts to Victoria's Secret again, transitioning into crude jokes about overweight wives and their husbands' reactions to lingerie.  They discuss New York strip clubs' rejected charity donations, leading to a discussion on charities rejecting donations from "bad" sources and the Opie and Anthony show's rejection by the Jimmy Fund.  They announce a planned "Money Snatch" segment involving naked women, leaf blowers, and money, referencing a past participant's emotional reaction. The upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree" is also mentioned.  A highly offensive critique of the *Rocky Balboa* trailer ensues, focusing on the film's plot and acting.  A live segment from a drugstore, with Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy (a producer), attempting to buy "condom discs," ends abruptly due to technical difficulties.  Roland, a producer, reviews *Casino Royale*, with the hosts providing comedic commentary.  Further discussion of upcoming events and final banter concludes this section.

A recurring segment involves absurdly simplistic movie descriptions by callers and the hosts, with a studio guest, Roland (a former Carson Daly intern), whose incoherent attempts are heavily mocked.  Anecdotes about Roland's experiences with Carson Daly, including audio clips of awkward interactions with celebrities like Mike Myers and Janine Garofalo (referred to with a vulgar term), and a Chewbacca impression for Kevin Smith are shared.  The Aspen Comedy Festival anecdote is also mentioned.  The XM Nation Awards are discussed, highlighting Kevin Federline's "Keep Your Day Job" award. A review of Than and Sam's radio show, with Than and Sam joining the broadcast, highlights its rough start, technical difficulties, and potentially legally questionable segments.  They are given another show, renamed "Trainwreck Radio".

The show continues with a discussion of the XM Nation Awards.  The hosts express disgust at "Who Let the Dogs Out" being voted for banning, and discuss their choices for deceased artists to return, focusing on John Lennon and his potential political shifts.  Sting's "Songs from the Labyrinth" and its accompanying musician receive scathing commentary.  A significant portion analyzes Craig Shoemaker's "Love Master" bit, with the hosts and callers expressing disapproval, playing audio clips and debating its humor, particularly comparing it with other comedians like Richard Pryor, Brian Regan, and Larry the Cable Guy.  A Canadian caller defends the bit, leading to a debate about geographic biases in comedy.  The segment ends with further criticism of Shoemaker's bit and the XM Nation's voting choices, and mentions the deceased comedian Glenn Super. The "Line of the Day" winners are announced.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony and James Norton.  Here we go.  Virus.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next vector until there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with pure rage. And then eventually, everything just stops. 
[00:00:30]  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failures.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fest.  Who cares about the funny? Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he.  O.P.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing. I'm dancing. I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance. 
[00:01:00]  Oh!  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Ha! Ha!  Why are you crying? The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know. It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the O.P. and Anthony's Joe.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And...  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, did you see that shirt? 
[00:02:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Hey, good morning.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I, the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  The People's Radio Show.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Monday morning.  Arrgh.  Yuck.  Blech.  We got lots to do today.  Where to begin, though?  Where to begin?  I just got annoyed. 
[00:03:00]  Why, why?  First thing in the morning.  Because the pal talk sound isn't on again.  The microphones aren't, you know, working for the, when it's supposed to be.  You know, I was told Friday, when they weren't working, for some reason.  They work Thursday.  And then you come in Friday, and someone screws with something.  Because that's what happens at radio stations, apparently.  You leave, everything works fine.  You come in, everything's screwed up, or at least something's screwed up.  So the mics don't work. 
[00:03:30]  And I was told, oh, it'll be fixed immediately.  After you guys, you know, leave, or whatever, or whenever.  And then I come in, and turn on the cameras, and type in, a sound, question mark?  No, no, no, no, no, no sound.  No sound.  So nothing, nothing was touched.  And we're an extremely interactive radio show.  We need the pal talk thing, working every day.  That's what we do.  And, you know, they want us to be over here.  We want to be broadcasting our show from one lousy studio.  We'd love to do one.  One stupid studio.  We do five to five and a half hours of radio a day. 
[00:04:00]  We do three over here, and then we do two to two and a half over at XM.  And, you know, if it was up to us, we'd do it all from one lousy place.  But both companies have big, huge, you know what.  And they have to show their big, huge you-know-whats.  So it's like, no, we need them over here so we can control them.  Then they can go over to XM, and then you can control them over there.  Yeah.  And we said, all right, fine.  We folded.  We budged.  Yeah, well, we'll swing it.  We'll make the best of it. 
[00:04:30]  We'll do our little walkover thing.  It'll be cool.  And then we'll, you know, go to another studio.  But here's the deal over at XM.  It's our studio.  No one touches.  No one fiddles.  No one fiddles with things.  There's the constant fiddling done in here.  There's a lot of fiddling when we're not in here because we have to share this studio with a bunch of other shows.  Over at XM, we don't.  So when we leave on a Friday, all the knobs are exactly where we left them.  Yeah.  So if they want us over here, they've got to make sure the studio is set every single morning exactly how we like it. 
[00:05:00]  That's the last thing we need to worry about.  We're trying to entertain the entire world.  At least make sure no one's fiddling.  Fiddling.  With the studio when we're not here.  Stop fiddling with the buttons.  Someone apparently screwed with this.  I mean, they screwed with it.  Well, every day they're screwing with something.  I mean, today it's the pal talk cameras.  It's a bigger issue.  You know, every day we start with some kind of bitch that the mics don't sound right. 
[00:05:30]  Sometimes they're not even on because someone had to fiddle with the program buttons.  Fiddling.  Stop your fiddling.  Don't touch anything.  Leave it alone when it's working.  What are they touching?  We've got to get the two bosses communicating, you know, because if the bosses over here want us to continue doing the show over here,  then the place has to be set up nicely, perfectly every morning.  Consistently.  Consistently, yes.  Something's going to be screwed up. 
[00:06:00]  At least have it screwed up every day.  Jesus.  So that's today's problem?  Yeah, that's today's bitch.  And every day it's something over here.  So, I don't know.  And we'll have to have Eric Logan and, I guess, Tom Chiasana, like, you know, communicate.  Have a powwow.  We're going to have to have a powwow.  Because we're doing them a favor.  Because, you know, when we put this big, huge, massive, never-been-done-before deal together, stupid us, we're like, 
[00:06:30]  all right, cool, we'll just broadcast from one studio.  But they want us over here.  Which is fine.  I mean, it's a great facility.  It's awesome.  It's actually a larger studio than the one over at XM.  Yep.  But every morning, we don't want to have to worry about what has been fiddled with.  Fiddled.  Say it, Jimmy.  Say it.  Stop fiddling with the buttons.  We have a fiddler among us.  There's a fiddler.  He comes in.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle. 
[00:07:00]  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Hey, could you, don't bother me.  I'm fiddling.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  I went to broadcasting school.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle,  fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle,  fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle. 
[00:07:30]  Moving these things.  Pot it up and down.  Fiddle.  That's what I was trying to come up with, yeah.  Pot it up, pot it down, pot it up, pot it down.  Where was it?  I don't remember.  I don't know.  Who cares?  I just wanted to fiddle.  Phone.  I can't come to the phone.  I'm potting and fiddling.  I'll get back to the phone.  Fiddling and potting.  Stupid fiddlers should have their fingers chopped off.  Anyway, we start with good old John Liu.  Someone has to fight back with this ass. 
[00:08:00]  He's basically saying that Asians don't have a sense of humor.  That's what I get from John Liu.  He's the Asian Reverend Al.  Yeah.  That's what he is.  The Queen's councilman here in New York.  Wannabe.  He's a councilman.  That's like one step above a fiddler.  Librarian.  There's librarian, fiddler, and then councilman.  Councilman.  What does a councilman really do?  They do nothing.  You have to advertise on someone's lawn.  Yeah, that's when you want to be elected.  You need to stick a sign on someone's lawn. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, you're just in the way.  All you want to do is mow your lawn, and it's like, oh, yeah, I agree to have the councilman's  little freaking advertisement on my lawn.  Councilman's like the lowest rung on that political ladder.  Yes.  Where they have direct contact with people, and they're supposed to like, from neighborhoods.  Like, he's from 1st Street to like 5th Street is your area, and you're supposed to talk to  those people and then convey what they want to the next guy up. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  And it works its way up to the people that can actually do stuff, but by that point, you  know, it's been bastardized.  Right.  So they don't do anything.  Right.  Basically, a councilman falls, is kind of like, he's below assemblyman and above pedophile.  Well, it's kind of like a wannabe politician.  Yeah.  It's a springboard, hopefully, into an empty pool.  Well, John Lewis, the one.  It's one step above student council. 
[00:09:30]  Student government.  Yeah, student government.  Student government.  It's one step above the class president in your high school.  President?  The class treasurer.  Right.  You know, I don't even want to say what John Lewis said.  This is what I want to do.  I'm going to play a little piece of audio.  It's really quick.  And it's a barometer.  If you see nothing wrong with the piece of audio I'm about to play, then you're perfect  for this radio show.  Yeah.  Because there's probably a lot of people out there still figuring it out. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know if I like these guys yet.  I don't know who's who.  And they don't explain things.  And I don't really know what wow is yet.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  They're too mean.  They've gotten too nice.  Oh, I know.  Have you heard both, right?  Of course.  It's ridiculous.  More Jim.  Less Jim.  Less meanness.  More meanness.  More stunts.  Less stunts.  Nudity.  No nudity.  I say go screw yourself.  Better if it hurt.  Take care of it.  There.  More fiddling.  They need to fiddle more. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  But here's a great barometer.  If you see nothing wrong with this, then this show is definitely perfect for you.  Because this is a very tame thing, by the way.  Okay?  Danny DeVito getting drunk on The View recently.  Yeah.  Just snotted.  Just hammered.  It was hammered.  It was funny to watch.  Certainly.  And Rosie O'Donnell, who's taking over the show, and no one is happy about it.  I know we're supposed to be talking to guys out there, but we're obsessed with Rosie O'Donnell  taking over Barbara Walters' stupid show. 
[00:11:00]  We like her.  We like the fact that she's kicking Barbara's old woman teeth in.  Absolutely.  But they're already starting rumors that they're not going to renew her contract, and she's  probably going to go off and do her own thing.  Oh, we've got to talk about Apocalypto as well in a few minutes here.  So the Danny DeVito story hits, and, you know, well, it happened on their show, and then  the next day, Rosie O'Donnell's commenting on how huge the story got, and how everybody's  talking about it, okay?  And this is what she had to say.  All right.  The fact is that it's news all over the world. 
[00:11:30]  You know, you can imagine in China, it's like,  Even getting huge laughs from the Fat Housewives.  The Fat Housewives even enjoying it.  Getting laughs.  It was so, the intent, this is why, there's no ill intent in that at all.  Right.  No, there was no ill intent in that.  No.  Right.  And John Liu, who's a councilman, he's Asian obsessed.  We get it.  You're Asian. 
[00:12:00]  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Enough.  He's protecting all Asians, because, you know, if you're Asian, you can't take care of yourself.  You need this guy to protect you.  And if you're Asian, you can't.  Oh, God, we're talking to San Francisco this morning.  I'll just get dumped out of him.  I'm sure.  Hey, San Francisco.  San Francisco, how are you?  So, and he's also saying you don't have a sense of humor if you're Asian.  You can't take any ribbing.  Ribbing.  To the ribs.  You can't take any pokes to the rib.  Queen City Councilman John Liu has sent a letter to Barbara Walters, co-owner, producer, and host of The View, blasting Rosie O'Donnell's mimicking of the Chinese language last week on the popular daytime talk show. 
[00:12:30]  He's all bent out of shape because of what you just heard.  Hey, John, to us, to people that don't speak Chinese, that's what it sounds like.  I'm sorry, but that's what it sounds like.  If we could actually speak Chinese, I'm sure if Rosie could speak Chinese and actually say, hey, wasn't that funny when Danny DeVito was drunk on The View? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah, it was hysterical when Danny DeVito was drunk on The View.  In actual Chinese, she'd have done that.  Yeah.  But she doesn't know how, so you make it sound like it sounds to everybody that doesn't speak Chinese.  Get over it.  Your people pretty much sound like model airplanes.  Right.  That's it.  Kick them over.  Come on. 
[00:13:30]  Every time an Asian girl walks up to me, I'm expecting her to throw a hat into a helicopter.  What do you think of them apples?  Stupid.  Enough of you.  No sense of humor.  And for some reason, he's got some power, man, because you just make fun of the Asian culture, the don't say Oriental, because that's even.  That's a thing, not a person.  No, I understand.  But if you say that, that's even bad if you make that mistake.  That's bad.  But he gets people apologizing all over the place.  Like, I mean, he's got in trouble and he had to apologize.  Yeah.  For some reason, he's got this power. 
[00:14:00]  And every time somebody concedes to him, he gets a little more power.  He's just a baby.  He's a baby.  Just don't give him.  Don't.  Don't cave into the guy.  Right.  Well, the letter dated December 9th said, O'Donnell's remarks hit a raw nerve in our community.  Does it?  The what?  The rudder.  The rudder.  You'll be apologizing for that, mister.  The rudder.  Why? 
[00:14:30]  Don, relax.  He's running to his keyboard as we speak.  Like, dude, I'm just tired and my mouth isn't warmed up yet, you ass.  I meant to say the letter.  The letter reads, should know that these types of derogatory remarks have consequences beyond the stupidity of the person who made them.  And then on Thursday, they explain what she did.  It's funny in writing because it says, Rosie said this, the fact is that it's news all over the world.  You can imagine in China, it's like Ching Chong, Danny DeVito, Chong, Drunk, The View, Chong. 
[00:15:00]  That's how they had to write it out in the paper.  Lou said the broadcast made him cringe.  Stop it.  It's so repulsive.  That's absurd, he said yesterday.  Coming from someone who herself has been indignant when she has felt that certain comments insult a community.  See, that's why everybody should just shut up.  Yeah.  Because one person who's offended by one thing is going to do something that offends another person.  It's called life.  She did get mad about that Clay Aiken remark, or whatever it was. 
[00:15:30]  The guy, who was it, Kelly Ripper said something about, you don't know where Clay Aiken's hands have been,  and then Rosie got like a little like, hey, well, that's an anti-homophobic remark.  Right, right.  Yeah, which wasn't.  Yeah, we took her to task on that as well.  On Rosie O'Donnell's blog, the following response was posted about the incident.  It was not my intent to mock, just to say how odd it is that Danny Drunk was news all over the world, even in China.  It was unclear whether O'Donnell had posted the blog.  A representative for O'Donnell, who is also a comedian, reportedly implied the comments were delivered in jest. 
[00:16:00]  Of course they were.  Last week, the Asian American Journalist Association called the comments a perpetration of stereotypes of Asian Americans as foreigners or second-class citizens.  If you're such great Americans, and again, I kind of like the Asian community because you don't beg for anything from the government.  You just do one thing.  But why do you have to have a group called the Asian American Journalist Association?  What do you all get together and discuss? 
[00:16:30]  What is that?  What?  Asian journalism?  You have to belong to something where your ethnicity is key.  Some little group.  So you all get together to play ping pong.  Ping pong.  Ping pong.  We're good at that.  We're Sudoku.  Sudoku?  On Friday night, they all get together and have beverages and play Sudoku.  They hand out pencils with big erasers for some Sudoku fun.  Sudoku.  What a bunch of douches. 
[00:17:00]  Ping pong.  Why do you have to belong to something with your ethnicity mentioned in it as a group of journalists?  Why don't you just be a journalist?  Oh, yeah.  They can't.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  The ones that want to be the most accepted are the ones that are most excluded.  They're the ones that want to have their own separate groups.  Separatism.  And they're the ones that are crying all the time. 
[00:17:30]  Why can't you just treat us like every other regular Joe?  Well, because you have different organizations that are Asian or black or this or that or that.  Just have an organization.  Journalists.  You have a little journalist club.  And if someone wants to be Asian or black or Hispanic or white and join your little group, it's fine.  The Asian American Journalists.  What do you talk about?  How the Opie and Anthony show gets you fired for turning around and cursing at people? 
[00:18:00]  I'll bet you they get together once a week and they just confirm that they're horribly boring as individuals.  There was a rumor that you did something exciting.  No, no.  It was my neighbor.  All right.  It wasn't me.  Well, how can I tell you?  You all have the Pete Rose haircuts.  That's a stereotype.  Certainly.  It's only true.  There's four Asian people that do not have that haircut.  Right.  The Asian Press Club.  Yellow Journalism. 
[00:18:30]  Fred from FUNA wants to know.  I don't think so.  All right.  So that's one of the big stories happening as we wake up this morning.  It's so stupid.  It was just a quick thing on The View.  But he knows that.  If you want to ching-chong, then you should be able to ching-chong.  Why not?  It is America after all.  But then again, you know, if you're on TV or on the radio, you don't have the same freedoms.  When's the last time John Lue, you heard of him doing anything that wasn't ethnic involved?  I mean, at least it doesn't get coverage in the papers that I'm reading.  No one cares about him unless it's this. 
[00:19:00]  He's a professional race baiter.  That's what he is.  I haven't said...  What does he do?  Nothing.  I want to see one thing he's done for his community.  And by community, I mean the people he represents, not just Asian people.  What has he done?  And it's another politician that doesn't go after the really tough issue.  No.  You know how much freaking Asian prostitution there is in Manhattan?  Oh.  You don't want him going after that. 
[00:19:30]  No.  Of course not.  Everyone needs a little release in their life.  Absolutely.  How about the roads?  Why don't you get the potholes fixed so those rickshaws aren't bumping everything up?  Right.  Why don't you go after the happy endings?  There.  Why don't you take that on?  I don't want happy endings anymore for anybody!  I don't think people would be happy with that.  No.  It could be a threat to him.  I was reading the paper how they smuggle the Asians into this country.  Yeah, there you go.  How about Asians that are smuggling Asians in? 
[00:20:00]  Take that on.  They go into these big containers and they go across a few oceans.  There's a hundred in them living for a month at a time.  They get out and put them up in Yankee Cranky shops and everywhere else until they pay their bill.  And whoever survives gets to live in America.  And it guarantees people die, don't even make it.  Don't make the voyage.  Yeah.  In one piece.  Yeah, they just throw them overboard.  And then they sneak them into Manhattan and Queens and Brooklyn and Staten Island.  And then they work illegally. 
[00:20:30]  And yeah, they have to pay off their debt.  Yep.  Go after that.  The slave trade.  It's alive and well in the year 2006.  Go after that.  See how long you last.  But John Liu has to go after Rosie because she did a few chings and chongs.  Yeah, because Rosie's not going to put a bullet in his head.  Those smugglers are tough.  Those are tough guys.  Oh, those are the Kung Fu guys.  Turn around.  Yeah.  You don't want to mess with them.  Oh, they know Kung Fu?  Oh, yeah.  Kung and Fu.  They have to, right?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know, guys.  That's a little stereotypical. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, it is.  I don't know about that.  We like stereotyping on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's what we do.  Hey, at one point in the show, I haven't really read the article yet, but it's a story about  how a girl got better from anorexia with the help of her cat.  And I just can't wait to say something bad about her.  With that, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the annual Eggnog Challenge, coming to the Opie and Anthony show this Friday, December 1st. 
[00:21:30]  The person who holds down the most eggnog gets $500, which unfortunately won't buy back  your dignity.  For details, go to opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  It's the annual Eggnog Challenge this Friday, December 1st, on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe. 
[00:22:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Hi, I'm Danny.  I'm producing the weekend show here on XM 202, The Virus.  I'd love to tell you about Bill Burr's show this weekend, Saturday, December 16th,  from 9 to midnight, but Bill hasn't called me back to tell me what the name of it is  or what it's about.  He mentioned stuff about cock rings and tushalingus, but I don't want to jump the gun.  So stay tuned, this Saturday, December 16th, from 9 to midnight, for the Ass Licking Cock 
[00:22:30]  Rings and Pre-Cum show, with your host, Bill Burr.  Bill, if you want to change the name of the show, can you call me?  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Thanks for checking us out.  Lots going on today.  I think we're just going to attack a lot of people today.  We got a rabbi getting...  Well, we got a rabbi getting rid of Christmas trees at an airport in Seattle. 
[00:23:00]  Can we just deal with that ass first?  Because that's annoying me since I heard about it.  And we got to do the Mel Gibson.  Also, protest of Victoria's secret G-string displays spreads in Detroit suburbs.  Problem there?  Can't have a G-string on a mannequin, I guess.  On a mannequin?  We'll get into that story in a little bit.  Of course, we should talk about the shooting in downtown Chicago there. 
[00:23:30]  I think that happened on Friday, right?  Over a toilet patent.  Yeah, some guy wanted something patented.  Yeah.  And it didn't get patented, so he shot a bunch of people.  So he killed three people.  That's terrific.  And down in Philly, they're talking about Allen Iverson.  He's going to be traded today.  It's huge news in Philly.  Philly.  Yeah.  Also, the Rocky movie opening, so they're getting excited now in Philly.  Well, that's the hugest news ever.  And then in Boston, they got the Condom Bomber. 
[00:24:00]  So we got lots to do today.  Condom Bomber.  But we're going to start with the rabbi.  Yeah, this is annoying.  Annoying another person with just nothing to do but ruin other people's fun.  It's not even him I have the problem with.  It's little faggots in Seattle, which is just such a piecey cesspool, that city.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Well, apparently, the Seattle airport.  For the past 10 years, they've been setting up Christmas trees. 
[00:24:30]  To get into the spirit.  Around Christmas time.  Yeah.  I would say the holiday time, but it's Christmas.  It's Christmas time.  We invented this time of year.  Stop it already.  It's Christmas.  Everybody else jumped on our bandwagon.  Can we just have Christmas?  We invented this whole holiday.  Ugh.  And you guys knew how great it was.  You had to jump on board.  Christmas kicked ass.  And people said, wow, that's a holiday. 
[00:25:00]  We need a piece of this action.  We've got to get in on this.  What happened in our religion right around the same time.  Yeah, let's look at some books and try to figure out how we could turn this into a Christmas ripoff.  Well, we had oil that lasted a lot longer than it was supposed to.  All right, let's piggyback Christmas.  That'll be our Christmas.  Come on.  That's all I know about Hanukkah.  Something about oil lasted a long time.  I didn't even know that until you said it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Gary Goldman told me that during the Torgasm tour.  He was talking about Hanukkah and stuff.  And I guess that's what it's about.  Something to do with oil.  Lasting a long time.  Oil was only supposed to last like a couple of days.  And it wound up lasting eight days.  You know it was eight days?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  Oh, I guess because Hanukkah is eight days long.  So there you go.  Oh, is that why they light a different candle every day?  Yeah.  Well, that's really exciting.  Yeah.  How about this?  Christmas, you know, we all know a Jesus. 
[00:26:00]  He pushed a rock out after he was dead.  Your turn.  Your turn.  That's Easter.  No, but I mean still.  Then they got the Passover.  That's the guy's birthday, I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's his birthday.  He was born.  I mean, granted, you did kill him.  So you got credit for, you know.  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Then we had Easter.  And then it's like, oh, well, Passover.  Got a Passover.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, well, really?  By the way, I was going to say that.  And don't get me started on Kwanzaa. 
[00:26:30]  I don't even know what Kwanzaa is about.  Kwanzaa is just.  No clue.  Doesn't exist.  There are certain, like, I don't even know what they are.  They're almost like rules or things.  I don't know how many there are of Kwanzaa that some guy, you know, respecting blah, blah, blah,  and taking care of this, and certain rules to follow.  Most black people realize that Kwanzaa is ridiculous.  Kwanzaa is silly.  Most black people, you know, they got their Christmas trees. 
[00:27:00]  They're like, screw this Kwanza crap.  Christmas.  All right.  So what's up with the airport and the trees?  You want to get into the story here?  Yeah.  The airport's been setting up Christmas trees for 10 years.  10 years.  It's kind of nice.  You know, it gives that festive holiday spirit as you're walking through the airport.  But some rabbi, I guess, wanted to get a menorah set up in there, in the airport, which then  opened the doors for every other religion wanting to dump every piece of religious trash 
[00:27:30]  all over the place.  And the airport said, we can't do it.  Right.  Can't do it.  So the rabbi threatened to sue.  And this is what happened.  And the airport, not wanting to get into a big, long battling in the courts, decided  they were going to take the tree down and use the year now to assess this and figure  out what to do and what would be in everybody's best interest.  So they had to take the trees down and throw it in a closet somewhere.  Yeah.  There goes the festive time of year. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Well, here's the story.  Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.  Christmastime imagery, but the trees have been taken down.  It started with this rabbi's complaint, but this is not what he wanted.  The Jewish community at large is offended by the removal of the Christmas trees.  What he wanted was for something to be placed alongside one of the trees, a menorah.  He says the Hanukkah symbol, as seen in other public displays, represents triumph of freedom  over oppression.  It's not just a message for Judaism. 
[00:28:30]  It's a message for hope for everyone.  But he didn't just ask.  Really?  He threatened a lawsuit.  And the commission that oversees the airport says there was no time to reach a resolution.  Frankly, we are faced with the choice of either spending unknown amounts of the public's  dollars and countless hours of litigation or trying to figure out how to accommodate all  these cultures all at once when we were underway trying to bring a half a million people through  Sea-Tac Airport in the busiest possible seasons. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, they threw a few trees up and now they have to pretty much shut down the airport  to try to figure out how to please every religion.  She actually makes a valid point.  It's like, you know, we're trying to run a goddamn airport here.  We don't have time for this crap.  Pack up the trees.  Good.  Everyone loses.  Go F yourselves.  That's pretty much what they said.  Right.  Go F yourselves.  We can't accommodate everybody.  We're just trying to get people from point A to point B. 
[00:29:30]  So forget it.  Then no one gets anything.  Just paint the walls gray and leave everything alone.  And give us all gray clothes.  That's what I want.  I want it to look like 1984 all over.  And I don't mean the real one.  I mean the fake book one.  Because I am tired of the shoulder pads, the spiky hair, and the Chinese shirts.  We got the flat screens.  And the separate parachute pants.  They're looking at us as we look at them.  Yes.  I could tell.  Big brother.  And make sure everyone's hair color is the exact same. 
[00:30:00]  Everybody should just be the same.  It would probably work out for the best.  Then there'd be no offending anybody because everybody would be exactly the same.  So the trees came down and tempers went up.  It's kind of sad that we have to do that now.  It seems to try to please everybody.  To take away the Christmas tree to me, you know, is just saying that Christmas doesn't count when it's an aspect of Christmas.  Airport employees are angry too.  Can the reporter be a little angry or show any type of emotion?  No.  No nationality, he must be.  They are angry too. 
[00:30:30]  Listen to this guy.  Christmas doesn't count when it's an aspect of Christmas.  Airport employees are angry too.  Everybody's been outraged enough that they're probably going to bring in their own solution tomorrow.  And to demonstrate, I suppose they're going to bring their own Christmas trees.  And we're going to display them as a ticket counters.  And the rabbi says he wants the Christmas trees back up too.  So why doesn't the airport just put the trees back up, add a menorah, and everybody goes home happy?  Well, the commission that runs the airport says the concern is that if they represent Hanukkah, 
[00:31:00]  they'll have to be concerned about representing all cultures that may have holidays this time of year.  And they say that at this point, there just isn't enough time to take care of everybody.  How many holidays are there this time of year?  You know, every culture.  What do the Muslims do around that time?  I know Christmas.  You had people in the airport.  How could we have that going on?  How could you symbolize nothing fun happening?  I know Christmas.  I know Hanukkah.  And a little bit of the Kwanzaa.  That's it.  By the way, the principles of Kwanzaa. 
[00:31:30]  Yes, the principles.  That was it.  This is a very fun...  It's about the sevenfold path of blackness.  Right.  That's it.  That's fun.  What?  Isn't that festive?  The what?  The sevenfold path of blackness.  And here, I'll just give you the quick ones.  Please.  Unity.  You don't hear about that in the black, you know, community.  It rhymes with community.  That's how they use it a lot.  Unity in the community.  We need unity.  Self-determination.  Collective work and responsibility. 
[00:32:00]  Cooperative economics.  Purpose, creativity, and faith.  Ugh.  What kind of fun is that?  Is this on Bizarro World?  Try writing a song around that.  On the first day of Kwanzaa, the principle that we adhere to is unity.  Me and another person of the same race in a pear tree.  See?  That's unity.  Oy.  Stupid. 
[00:32:30]  Oy, oy, oy.  Lloyd.  With a fork in their ass, Jerry.  Lloyd in Kansas, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, you guys are forgetting to mention Festivus.  The Festivus for the rest of us.  What the hell is Festivus?  Festivus.  Seinfeld.  Seinfeld, of course.  George had to live through Festivus as he was growing up.  Festivus.  All right, so no trees for you in Seattle.  No, and because, yeah, they could put a menorah up. 
[00:33:00]  It would be easy enough.  But then all of a sudden, everybody else would be, that offends me.  You know why the menorah, let me tell you.  The menorah would offend every Muslim walking through that airport.  Every single one of them would look at that menorah in disgust because of their hatred for the Jews.  So then they would go up and go, that offends me, that religious symbol.  We need ours in there.  And God knows what that is.  Yeah.  Allah knows what that is.  Just a person not having fun.  A miserable person sitting there, fully, like, bundled up so you can't see anything but their peepers. 
[00:33:30]  Women getting beaten by sticks.  Look, here's our Santa Claus.  It's just a guy with his fist up in the air burning an effigy.  All angry at something.  Can they stop burning effigies?  Firing weapons in the air.  All right, well, moving on.  Good old Mel Gibson was number one at the box office.  Good for Mel.  Apocalypto.  I see.  That's been a big problem, that anti-Semitic statement he made to the police officer, the Dewey. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, of course.  Guy just pumps out his own movies now.  Ah, doesn't care.  I don't need anyone.  This movie, number one at the box office, and I think we discussed this on Friday.  None of us want to go and see it because there's too much reading.  It's reading.  Again, it's another movie that just has subtitles because he had to do it in the genuine language that the people use.  The Mayans.  How about you do it in the language of the people that are going to go see it? 
[00:34:30]  That are paying their tickets.  Jesus.  And we'll just make believe that this would be in Mayan.  Yeah.  What's it about?  Apocalypto.  Well, it just looks awful.  It's a lot of violence.  They're saying it's one of the bloodiest movies ever made.  There's sex and violence.  There's a couple of civilizations battling, you know, and then one of which, I guess, gets wiped out, right?  The Mayans?  I, I...  Is that what happens?  Oh, great.  Now I don't need to see it.  Something like that?  Well, you...  You just saved me three hours of reading.  It's one of those things I just let everyone know.  Uh, but, uh, Cindy Adams, she's just terrific. 
[00:35:00]  This old broad that still writes for the New York Post here in New York City, I like to call  her a hag.  She is an old broad.  And she, here's the thing with her.  She's like, she...  The Post has these old ladies writing for them.  Her and that awful Linda Stacey, or Stassi.  We don't know.  And they try to be funny, and it's like, you're not a funny person.  Out of touch.  You're not...  You're an out-of-touch cornball.  Your writing is not funny.  Yeah, when are they going to get some younger writers? 
[00:35:30]  Some young gunslingers for the paper?  Dude, they stink.  Or could they come out with a newspaper that, uh, serves us?  Because who's, who's reading this drivel going, wow, man, she makes a good point?  Or who's laughing at it?  That's the greatest crime she commits, is she tries to be cute and funny, and she's not.  I could see her being relevant if, like, she was writing, you know, Charlton Heston's  new movie, Ben-Hur, came out this week.  Like, you could see she's that old, and that out-of-touch. 
[00:36:00]  But here's the point we're making this morning.  Her headline, Mel's Movie, Mean and Obscene.  Mean and Obscene, ooh.  That rhyme.  Now, now in America, you're, you're, you're allowed to have an opinion, obviously.  Sure.  You can say whatever the hell you want, for the most part.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  She, she didn't see the movie.  To distribute Mel Gibson's demented Mayan movie, the for sale sign must be hung out  at Disney, she says.  In the desire to make a buck, the industry has lowered itself into unrelenting, unredeeming, 
[00:36:30]  unforgiving violence.  And then here it is.  Because I won't see it doesn't mean I can't talk about it.  Her headline, Mel's Movie, Mean and Obscene.  She hasn't seen the movie, but she's going to talk all about it.  It should be Cindy Adams, old and irrelevant.  Yeah.  That's what the name of you, that's what your headline should be, because that's what  you are.  Because I won't see it doesn't mean I can't talk about it.  This ultimate desensitizing of mankind screened last week to one gathering of 14, nearly all 
[00:37:00]  left before the ending.  How do you know?  You weren't there.  Remember?  She probably heard about it, but it was, it was, you know, her friends.  It was, you know, a bunch of old broads.  Oh, her, oh, other credits.  Like Gene Shalot.  I didn't like it.  I left.  I cursed the screen and left.  That's my new thing.  Well, Rotten Tomatoes is a great website as far as movie reviews go.  They take all the reviews from across America, from all the big newspapers, and even from 
[00:37:30]  the internet, some of the respected review sites on the internet.  And then they give you a basic rating.  A Rotten Tomatoes means the movie sucks.  It means that more than 50% of the reviews say the movie stinks.  Understand what I'm saying?  Yeah.  So with Apocalypto, it's getting a fresh tomato, meaning more people like it than hate it  across America in all these newspapers and on the internet.  It gets a 65% rating.  That's pretty, pretty good.  Is she saying like Braveheart wasn't good?  Because that was, there was some violence in Braveheart. 
[00:38:00]  That was a violent movie.  That wasn't good?  As long as there's a good story to it.  You know, she said nothing about the story behind it or if there's any, you know, human emotion  to it, whether you feel for the characters, what the story's about.  You know why she doesn't?  She didn't see the movie.  She just heard from her little old lady friends.  There was so much blood and gore. 
[00:38:30]  This is Mel Gibson.  He's crazy.  So that's what she writes about.  How about going out and seeing it?  Or at least have a car, a friend of yours, run off a copy so you can watch it at home.  Yeah, if you're going to destroy the guy in his movie, the least you can do is go see  the damn thing.  I watched the James Bond movie at the Panasonic Plasma Cineplex.  It's a wonderful theater.  I was.  Very close to my house.  No seats.  You lay in bed.  It was good.  And you watch it.  You could pause the movie and go to the bathroom. 
[00:39:00]  Really?  Fantastic.  The greatest theater I've ever been to.  I see all my movies there now.  Was it good?  Good movie?  Really good.  Casino Royale.  That Casino Royale is fantastic.  Great movie.  Totally threw away the old Bond playbook.  All that goofy cornball crap.  And just put in a kick-ass Bond that just is ruthless.  And you see how he kind of becomes Bond. 
[00:39:30]  Really a good movie.  And just a great torture scene in there.  Yeah.  That is brutal.  He takes a little bit of torture.  And it's a brutal torture scene.  As a guy.  I'll put it that way.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Very good.  Very good.  They made him read a year's worth of Sidney Adams columns.  Now you ruined it.  All right.  Yes.  That's what happened.  All right.  Getting back to what Sidney wrote.  You know what she should be writing about?  How to match pearls and diapers. 
[00:40:00]  That's what you should be writing about.  Did you read this paragraph in Exercise and Sadism and all that, Ant?  Yeah.  You did read that part?  No.  All right.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Continue there.  Because that's just terrific.  An exercise in sadism, barbarism, degradation.  More chilling and killing to human values than pornography.  The fact that this symphony of hate is only R-rated speaks of the moral depravity of the ratings board. 
[00:40:30]  But she didn't even see it in the movie.  She didn't see it.  If there is a hell and it has a cineplex in it, this will play on every screen.  Yeah.  And you'll be sitting next to everybody.  You haven't seen it.  It clarifies one thing, however.  You can no longer despise Mel Gibson for hating the Jews.  This deeply disturbed human being hates everyone.  And one doesn't need to suffer through Psychiatry 101 to see he hates himself.  Now she's psychoanalyzing Mel Gibson through his movies that she hasn't seen. 
[00:41:00]  This friggin' old bat.  The last claim has good reason.  This I can understand.  I join him in it.  She hates Mel.  Yeah.  And another time, in another era, they might take him away.  Today they give him a camera and a crew.  Take him away.  Take him away for what?  Making a movie?  For what?  For being drunk and not liking Jews? 
[00:41:30]  That's not illegal.  Well, O.J. the Unguilty, who allegedly might have only sliced and diced two human beings,  his story just got zapped from the screen.  And mad movie maker Mel, the world-class hater, we give international attention?  And should it play in, and should it play in that fun guy Adolf Hitler's hometown, what local title will they give it?  Mine Mayan?  And this bag of meat, which is what, this cryptic bag of meat, ends every R column with, 
[00:42:00]  only in New York, kids, only in New York.  Yeah.  And this is what, this is what she writes leading up to it.  This is supposed to be funny.  Ready?  A compulsive woman shopper living on the Upper East Side has already exchanged two Christmas gifts she received. 
[00:42:30]  Ah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Who's laughing at that?  She goes, it's not Christmas yet, Jimmy.  Only in New York, kids.  Why, she's crazy.  Only in New York would this Cindy Adams say that.  They give her half a page almost every day.  Hey, she's so out of touch.  They're just awful.  This broad is so out of touch.  When are they going to acknowledge that she's out of touch?  Put her out the pasture.  I could see if she saw the movie, found it gross, disgusting, offensive, didn't like it. 
[00:43:00]  That way, at least she could maybe, I know she's not a movie review column,  but perhaps give a little more insight to the movie before you just trash it based on what your old bat friends say.  And it was number one at the box office.  Yeah, there you go.  And for the most part, getting a lot of really good reviews across America in all the major newspapers.  Again, reading.  Stupid reading.  But I want to see it now, and I want to support Mel Gibson just because everybody's attacking him because of what he said. 
[00:43:30]  All right, what he said was stupid, but let it go.  Apparently people are.  Now he shouldn't be able to make movies.  Do you go to movies that are subtitled?  Yeah, I would.  No.  I have, but it's, you know, it's the famous joke, too much reading.  You're like, action.  You've got to look around.  Action.  You know, it was great.  Das Boot in a subtitle because you've got to hear that original language.  And Downfall.  Downfall.  It could be with Hitler and the bunker. 
[00:44:00]  And that you've got to watch the subtitle because you just need them to be speaking in the German language.  It's too distracting because you know something really good is happening, and you're like, your brain's going nuts.  I've watched it a couple of times.  A couple of hundred times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's something.  It's a little inside, but there's a clip on YouTube that takes a clip from Downfall and Hitler yelling at his generals.  And it's all about him yelling about a piece of software, Microsoft Flight Simulator X, that came out and how buggy it is and how it's not really different from the other one. 
[00:44:30]  And if you've played the game, download that clip because it's hysterical.  It's just Hitler bitching about it like he's the head of Microsoft.  Very funny.  One of the funny things on YouTube out of the eight billion things you have to troll through.  Holy waste of bandwidth YouTube is.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Every so often one gets hit out of the park and you watch it and go, all right.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Someone did a good job on that.  But to see if I got to see one more high school age or inner 20s girl pontificating crap, I'm going to shoot myself or some old guy yelling or or just useless footage or something. 
[00:45:00]  Did you see what one guy did?  He put something Britney Spears, Britney Spears.  Let's just say her lower area that was exposed.  It was said that Britney Spears that falls out.  And you're like, oh, let me check this out. 
[00:45:30]  And it's a trailer for a movie.  I forgot what it was, what movie it is.  And then there's a quick like dot of Britney Spears picture in there.  And then people's comments are like, you son of a bitch.  You wrote me in.  But it was the most popular download.  Of course.  You got to go to break.com.  They organized it a little better.  People are now just titling things on YouTube to get it up there.  Just to get the attention.  With zero content.  Right.  You got to go to break.com.  Space 1999.  There, there it is.  And also Google is doing a pretty good job of their videos lately because they give you like the top hundred videos that people are checking out. 
[00:46:00]  Break does the same thing with most viewed.  Well, I mean, I know YouTube does that as well to a point.  But break.com is more imaginable.  My favorite video clip to watch lately, did you see the midgets fighting on Jerry Springer?  It's been out about a month.  Midget fights now.  It is.  It's.  Didn't see that.  It's the famous Jerry Springer we've seen a million times.  Chick.  Boyfriend.  She likes another dude.  This dude's coming to work. 
[00:46:30]  What's the deal with the dude coming to work?  But it's all done with midgets.  And then they go at it.  Then these two midgets just fight.  And one midget is a lot, lot shorter than the other one.  And then the one guy takes his shirt off and they're just going at it.  And they let them fight more than the normal size people.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  The one midget gets pretty much body slammed to the ground a few times.  It is hilarious.  They don't let real human beings fight on that show very long.  No.  It's called midgets.  No, they let them fight a little bit more.  Is there a midget councilman that's going to be all mad now? 
[00:47:00]  No, that's why Jerry Springer is brilliant.  That's why he's brilliant.  Because when the ratings start kind of going down a little bit, they let them fight a little more.  Yeah, midget fights.  They try to balance it perfectly.  It gets the ratings up.  Right, exactly.  It's called Jerry Springer midget fight.  That's the video I'm checking out like crazy lately.  People got to realize not everyone is a talented filmmaker.  Not everyone knows how to tell a good story through film.  So 99% of the crap on these video sites stink. 
[00:47:30]  Well, absolutely.  I never go to them.  All I want to see is live Sabbath footage or live Kiss footage.  Old concert footage that people post is great.  Stuff like that.  That's all I want to see.  They got all that.  You know, the next stage of this is someone's going to really do a great job with organizing all this crap.  It really is a waste of space because it could be used for something really good where you could maybe download stuff like that.  Old concerts, even historical footage of something that you might want to see. 
[00:48:00]  But it's loaded up with people's idea of what they think is funny or entertaining or interesting, even.  Right, right, right.  And it's just garbage.  All right.  We're going to step aside here, get into some other things.  Blah, blah.  Oh, really?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:30]  Coming soon to a snooty mall, maybe one near you.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What? 
[00:49:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  It's pest radio.  For the pests.  By the pests.  And like the pests.  And mostly stupid.  Coming in 2007.  Details on opieandanthony.com.  That's right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Very interactive here. 
[00:49:30]  1-866-313-FREE.  Give us a call.  We were just talking about YouTube.  There's a great story that just hit.  A lot of people are very pissed off because YouTube is teaching people how to steal.  Yeah.  Teaching people crimes.  Yeah, how to commit crimes.  Right there.  They're going to start regulating the internet even more.  They're going to make a lot of this stuff illegal.  It's impossible. 
[00:50:00]  It's just impossible to do.  I'm hoping it.  You really can't regulate it.  It's too widespread.  It crosses too many borders.  Oh, yeah?  They got rid of the online gambling.  I still play.  I just played in Sonny's Pest Poker last night.  Yeah, but you can't play with some dude in Iowa.  Yeah, you can.  Or some chick in Southern California.  Yeah, you can.  Or some Buffalo Betty in Buffalo.  Absolutely can. 
[00:50:30]  Sonny's Pest Poker is all over the country.  It's people.  It's pests from all over the place.  Yeah, but not everyone has a network of people that they can just tap into.  No, I could log on and play with random people all over.  Just like I always did.  You're Joe Schmoe and you can find this poker game?  Yep.  That absolutely is.  No, it's connected to the show.  It has to be.  No, no.  Absolutely not.  There's one service out there.  That said on its website, it said, look, we don't care what the regulations are. 
[00:51:00]  We're still doing this.  Aren't they going to shut them down?  They haven't.  But they will eventually.  They're out of the country.  They're out of this country.  I don't know how they're doing it, but that's how it works.  I enjoy the game.  You know how many people want to know of this site?  I think a lot of people know.  It's a big one.  In the Opie and Anthony community, of course they know.  I'm talking about the guys that aren't like pal talkers or not posted on message boards. 
[00:51:30]  I think at any given time, there's probably 100,000 people playing.  Well, that's terrific.  We've got a few million people.  Yeah.  And there's probably another couple hundred thousand out there listening right now that  want to know what game you're playing.  You can't announce on the radio probably, right?  Probably because we also have sponsors that might be a conflict.  Ah, ah, ah.  Oh.  All right.  So YouTube, teaching people how to steal.  Got knocked out early last night too.  Bastards. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Went all in.  Lost.  What was your hand?  I had ace king.  And I went up.  No, ace queen.  And someone had a pair of kings.  Pocket kings.  Nailed me.  What are you going to do?  I was out within like 15 minutes.  What are you going to do?  I know.  Ah, it's all right.  I won.  I won one of the games.  Could people go to Whack Bag and try to figure out this website if they had to?  Yeah.  You can go to Whack Bag.  There's a thread on it.  All right. 
[00:52:30]  Get in on it.  Here's the story.  YouTube teaches people how to steal.  What do you think of this stuff, by the way?  Anything should go on the internet, right?  It does.  And it has been.  What's the big deal?  This stuff's been in text for years.  They've had the ingredients to make bombs and all kinds of stuff.  But when it hits the internet, actually not even hits the internet because all that stuff  was on the internet.  Yeah.  But it's just more of a pain in the ass because you had to read and figure it out yourself.  They've made it real easy now.  You know, music downloading, same thing.  No one gave a crap until it became nice and easy and crystal clear. 
[00:53:00]  And then everyone gave a crap.  You know what I mean?  And the same thing is happening with YouTube.  You can see it being demonstrated.  Because you made a point.  All this stuff has been in books.  Yeah.  Over the years.  Remember the anarchist cookbook years ago?  That thing was like a lot of controversy behind that being available.  It was a big, thick book.  And you'd read it.  And it would teach you how to make bombs and all kinds of other things, commit crimes  and mayhem.  And then the internet, yeah, it was text-based sites that you'd go to that would tell you 
[00:53:30]  the same things.  And now they're showing you in video.  Yeah, which now the authorities are like, what?  Because now it's really easy.  It's right there for you.  Simple.  Here's the story.  YouTube, you learn, you steal.  That's the fear from home security experts about the growing number of how-to-rob videos  on the popular website, YouTube.  Specifically, YouTube carries over 200 clips with detailed instructions on how to pick locks. 
[00:54:00]  Security experts are outraged.  This is the destruction of everybody, this internet.  Now they're showing you how to rob an apartment, how to break in with a lockpick, show you exactly  how to do it.  There's how to pick a door lock.  This internet.  A deadbolt.  A master lock.  How to pick a lock in 30 seconds.  How to pick a bike lock with a Bic pen.  And they're all well-viewed.  One lockpicking instruction video has been seen over 60,000 times.  Yikes. 
[00:54:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Well, guess what?  You've got to make different locks now.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  What did that dope from Imas' show say?  What's his name from Imas' show?  Oh, it's Disinternet.  Disinternet is the destruction of society.  It's Disinternet thing.  Disinternet thing.  What's his name?  What's his name?  Bo.  Bo Deedle.  Bo Deedle. 
[00:55:00]  I recognize him.  Yeah.  That's Bo Deedle.  Bo Deedle.  He doesn't like the internet because it's teaching our kids to pick locks.  We need Bo Deedle who needs to pack heat to go golfing.  Have you learned anything from the internet?  Learned?  Yeah, a whole bunch.  Like stuff like that, though?  Just.  Yeah, a couple of things.  Yeah?  Never used them or anything, but.  Like what?  One was on tripwires.  Of course.  It was on improvised tripwires. 
[00:55:30]  But, you know, I'd never use them.  You got tripwires around your mansion?  No, I don't have any tripwires.  But, yeah, some kind of security things, things like that.  Over the weekend, I was reading a whole big thing on the Second Amendment.  Right to bear arms and all the controversy and debate on that one.  It was pretty cool.  It really was.  I spent about two hours reading the different interpretations of it.  What did you learn about the Second Amendment that you didn't know? 
[00:56:00]  No, I knew about it.  It was just getting both sides of it like that and people that think that the interpretation means that it's just for militias, which are outdated, and then people that mean it's for the people.  How it's stated, the people, and how it will never, ever get resolved until they can resurrect the dead people that actually wrote this crap down and asked them directly.  Yeah.  It is so separated, and the arguments for each side are so strong, and no one wants to give in. 
[00:56:30]  So we got to knock on some coffins.  Knock on some coffins and say, what did you mean by this?  What did you mean?  What did you mean?  Because this guy's saying you meant this, and this guy's saying.  Because it says, you know, well-regulated militia, and that leads people to believe that you need, that the Second Amendment means for a militia to be armed.  But then other people say, no, it says the right to bear arms.  It's the people's right to bear arms, and that gives you the ability, an armed public, to make a militia, and that's why the militia is even in there in the first place. 
[00:57:00]  But people will insist that it means only a militia.  Other people insist it means people.  So I was reading that, trying to get a little more insight and see which side it leans to a little more or the other through interpretations of it.  You cannot figure it out.  I hate getting into arguments like that.  There's no win arguments.  Whether it's politics or, like, the Second Amendment or abortion. 
[00:57:30]  I can't be bothered because there's no right answer.  No right answer.  I don't feel like arguing my point of view and then the person coming back with me with their point of view.  Oh, we're never going to get along here on this issue.  Just a waste of time in the end.  There were about 500 message posts after, you know, the actual article, and it was just people flaming each other back and forth, just arguing.  Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  I always find an argument like that.  Sometimes I'll say, you know, we're just going to have to agree to disagree. 
[00:58:00]  Ah, there you go.  You know what?  You laugh, Jimmy.  There are posts that actually say that in all seriousness.  One guy posted, and then they get into the gun itself argument of owning a gun.  Like, the whole thread just bastardizes into something else.  Then it turns into a gun, pro-gun, anti-gun argument.  And one guy wrote something like, you know, I don't have guns.  And I heard somebody come into my house and turn the lights on, and he left.  And I thanked God I didn't have a gun because what if I would have shot maybe my sister coming in or this, that, or the other thing. 
[00:58:30]  And I had a post, you know, during your bunch of hypothetical situations, I go, what if someone comes in, they are armed.  Right, right.  They rape your wife, maybe your children, murder them in front of you.  Right.  I go, I bet for a split second before he pops one into your head, you're going to think, God, I wish I had a gun. 
[00:59:00]  That's going to be the last thought.  And that's like, you know, one argument.  Yeah.  But then other people are like, more people are killed by accident, by guns in the home.  And then other people say, that is a bunch of bull crap.  So you're right.  There is absolutely no way of winning those arguments, and they're useless to even get into.  I mean, the phone's lit with people arguing both sides now.  We don't have enough time in the day to get into that.  Hey, Bill from Waterford, thanks, News.  I didn't know where to find information on how to pick locks, but you led me to YouTube. 
[00:59:30]  Yes, thanks.  Now, you know something?  He's absolutely right.  I watch YouTube.  I see inane, boring garbage.  I want to see lockpick videos.  I want to check it out now.  Jay from Jersey, 60,000 times, that number's going to go up now.  Stupid news.  Yep.  The news.  And here's Walter.  This is a very good point here.  Walter, what's going on?  Oh, hi.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good, Walter.  Long time listening.  First time calling.  Thanks for calling, Walt.  I didn't say that, actually.  But it is true. 
[01:00:00]  I was calling because I noticed that in reference to the internet and looking at things on the internet.  I know that it may not be me personally, but a lot of people look at porn, and they look at porn that, let's say, offers a lot of, let's say, bondage, for example.  And that doesn't mean just because you watch it, all of a sudden you start doing it.  You should, but you're right.  There's a big divide between what you watch and what you do.  That's true.  If I may, oh, I'm sorry for one more second.  If I may have watched those guys who crash all the time, like, there's no way I'm going to get on my bicycle and jump off the roof or on my skateboard and grab the tail of a truck. 
[01:00:30]  But I'm sure as I love watching it when they spill, you know what I mean?  Yeah, there's a curiosity.  It's like, oh, wow, that's kind of, I want to see how they do pick locks.  That doesn't mean I'm going to go out and start picking locks all over Manhattan.  It's just entertaining to watch.  Right, and your best argument was the anarchist cookbook, which obviously had all the information ahead of time.  It's just easier to get.  Yep.  It doesn't mean we're more intelligent or that we have more ambition than we have the Internet.  No, they get all nervous when it gets easy to get with all this stuff.  And now it's easy to get pretty much anything on the Internet, especially with these video sites all over the place. 
[01:01:00]  All right, thank you, Walter.  Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.  This is funny.  You know, we should ask people what they have learned from the Internet.  Yeah.  We can start with Spoon and Oost and Spoon.  What's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  A couple of things.  I have the original anarchist cookbook print and another book called Mad as Hell.  Mad as Hell?  Mad as Hell.  Hey, I see what you're going to say, so maybe try to keep it clean.  I want to make sure Al doesn't have a problem. 
[01:01:30]  The problem, Al.  Okay, what do you want to say?  I'll keep it clean for Pookie.  Pookie.  Pookie.  All right, the first one.  No, you have to say Al.  I'm going to keep it clean for you.  All right.  Ow.  I want people to get into the Al thing.  Ow.  Some of the things we do on this show, I'm not sure if people really get up for you.  Okay, Al.  Okay, Al.  Sit back down.  He's going to keep it clean.  Put your finger on the button. 
[01:02:00]  Ow.  Ow.  Okay.  All right.  What's your point, Pookie?  All right, the first one is how to screw with change machines.  You know the old school, the big brown ones that they had in the arcade rooms?  Yep, change machines, yeah.  It just says change on them?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Well, there's a way you can kind of screw with them.  You make a notch in a dollar bill, like an inch from the side and a half an inch from  the bottom, and it confuses the machine, making it think that it's a $5 bill.  It'll spit out $5 and change, and then it'll spit your dollar bill back. 
[01:02:30]  I've done it once.  And it worked, really?  Did you learn this on the internet, though?  What year did he do this in?  No kidding.  This was like before they started making the real small change machines.  The computerized ones?  Yeah.  Yeah, this was a few years back.  Yeah, there were books that you could get online and online at the library even, where  it was, they were called Get Even, and they were books that were pure revenge on people  you couldn't stand, how you could screw up their mail, have their mail sent to another 
[01:03:00]  address, screw with their cars through something as easy as the sugar on the gas tank gag, potato  in the tailpipe, or even worse things.  And they were just books completely dedicated to getting revenge on people that have wronged  you.  Those were around for years.  That's kind of like what that Mad as Hell book is about.  Now, if you want to screw with, if you work in an office setting and you don't like the  people that you work with and you just kind of want to mess with them a little bit, take 
[01:03:30]  a sliver, like, you know, by the size of your thumbnail of, like, or just a little drop  of hand soap or maybe a bar of soap.  Anthrax.  Put it in, put it in the coffee filter.  It gives everybody explosive.  All right.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, Al's ready to dump out.  Speaking of dumps.  Well, you just read the word, so.  Do you know what I did one time to a guy who I worked with who I didn't like, and I didn't  even learn this from the dead, I just knew to do this. 
[01:04:00]  His van was parked out behind the building.  And I came by one night, and it was dirty, and I wrote, wash me.  You bastard.  You did it.  That must have just set him off.  Well, I said, I'll get your goat.  Here's the problem.  So basically, that guy, I'm not sure if he learned from the internet or this book, but  what he learned, here's the question today. 
[01:04:30]  What have you learned from the internet?  The stupidest thing you've learned from the internet.  It doesn't have to be some crime thing, just in general.  And he learned how to give people explosive, think Taco Bell, think polite.  Yeah, I think we know.  It's not explosive heads.  Right, exactly.  You don't know what it is.  Exactly.  So that's the question today.  What have you learned from the dopey internet?  The stupid internet.  The stupidest thing.  Maybe what have you learned that you actually applied?  Because a lot of people learn things, but like the news said, they can learn this stuff. 
[01:05:00]  But, yeah, did you use it?  Right.  You learned it and use it for something?  Well, moving on with the story.  Let's amateurs have professional knowledge.  It says YouTube's popularity continues to skyrocket, leaving some saying the internet company needs  to use more discretion.  So how responsible should YouTube be if they make a better thief with one of these videos?  Oh, I think they should be liable.  If someone could prove that they learned how to pick these locks through what they learned  on YouTube, I believe the parent company of that should be responsible, should be liable, 
[01:05:30]  should be able to be sued for information they learned to commit a crime.  How useful are these types of videos?  To the hardened professional, it's not very useful.  He already knows this stuff.  But to the younger guy who wants to learn, we're creating a whole generation of professional  thieves.  What?  A whole generation of professional thieves.  You're not going to do it unless you were going to do it.  I truly believe that too, Anthony. 
[01:06:00]  If I was, let's say, younger, more impressionable, had the internet, and learned how to pick  a lock from there, I'd probably just test it out at home to see if it actually worked.  I would test it out on my sister's bike, like, oh, wow, look what I could do.  Yeah, yeah.  And go, oh, what is it?  But it's a big jump from doing that to pedaling downtown and stealing someone's bike.  Stealing bikes and breaking into houses.  You just feel good knowing, oh, wow, look what I could do.  There was that crew when I was growing up, that crew that was the breaking into house 
[01:06:30]  crew.  Everyone kind of knew a few of these guys that they'd break into people's houses, and usually  people they knew and just steal things, stereos and other things like that.  And I was never part of that.  I knew how they did it and what they were doing, but...  And if you wanted to, you could have been part of that crew.  I could have been part of it.  You could have joined.  Yeah, I just wasn't part of that, and neither would 99% of the other kids.  You didn't have that wiring in your brain.  No.  That's why when they go after violent video games and all that, it's so ridiculous, because 
[01:07:00]  if you're going to do some harm to another person, it's already in your skull.  It's in your head.  It's not something that's going to set you off.  It's who you are.  Whatever made it like that, it's not the internet or games.  Let's finish up this clip.  Well, you know, when I was a kid, I played a lot of asteroids.  It's not like I ran around shooting rocks.  Well, you know.  We're creating a whole generation of professional thieves.  Jimmy King is a former house thief who used to pick locks for a living. 
[01:07:30]  He says lock picking is what robbing is all about.  So just a short time ago, this kind of information was only available to professional thieves.  That's right.  But that's all changing.  Now it's open to everyone, anyone, anybody who wants to get into your house can go to  this site and find out how.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And good luck.  Good luck.  And?  All right.  Hope they don't pick mine.  Well, when we get back, we've got people that have learned all sorts of stuff from the  internet.  Learned how to get free soda from machines. 
[01:08:00]  I used to do that in high school, actually.  I'll tell you about that one.  Were you ever able to shove your hand up that vending machine?  Any type of vending machine and get something out?  Someone.  Frustrating, wasn't it?  Dude, not only did I know how to do that, I could choose which thing I wanted.  I don't know who.  Guinea little arm.  Oh, I was ridiculous.  I tell the story.  Yeah.  In 10th grade, I was 5'2", 91 pounds.  I was.  I was.  Ethiopian.  I was.  Shoving his hand in there trying to get a bag of chips. 
[01:08:30]  He actually slid it there himself and peaked.  Yeah.  What do you want?  He's in the machine.  What do you want, the chips?  Right.  I became really popular at Harborfields High School.  Like a senior or somebody noticed that I had a really thin arm, and he knew how to do  this, I guess.  Hey, come here.  He goes, come here.  And he showed me how to do it.  He goes, you shove your arm.  I mean, you have to shove it way up all the way, your elbows in the machine, all right?  And then he'd feel around for the buttons.  And then one was for, you know, orange soda, grape, Coke. 
[01:09:00]  And I would sit there for like an hour after basketball practice, and I would get everyone  their sodas.  They would just line up and like, what one do you want?  What a guy.  Yeah.  And I would just, and I, you know.  Skinny arm.  I was known as a guy that could do this.  There was not many in high school.  You had to have a really thin, ridiculous arm.  You had to know how to get up into the machine to figure out where the buttons were.  Like double jointed.  This is the old school vending machines.  I'm sure they have figured out, you know, where you can't do that anymore.  But my arm would be just banged up to the, I mean, because it would be all bruised and 
[01:09:30]  everything.  Because even though I had a really thin arm, I still had to really just shove it up in  there and mess it all up.  It was all cut up and bruised.  Shove it up in there.  Yeah.  But I didn't care because, you know.  Free soda.  People would like point at me like, hey, he's the one, man.  He knows how to do that.  Like a made man.  And then I kind of taught the next skinny kid to do it as I was graduating.  You've got to pass on that knowledge.  You've got to pass on that knowledge.  Sure.  Sure.  All right.  We'll continue by going to the phones next.  Learn how to make money out of money.  Oh, boy.  Is that the old printer gag? 
[01:10:00]  You might not want to know about that.  Learn how to bypass floors and elevator.  I don't know what that means.  Learn how to buy opium legally.  All right.  We've got some great phone calls.  We'll go to the phones next.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes. 
[01:10:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah.  Hey, good morning.  Jimmy's dancing.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, of course he's dancing.  Air guitar.  Air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air.  Oh, God.  We've got to do some karaoke today.  That's right.  For a MacBook.  MacBook karaoke started.  Giving away some MacBooks and going to be listening to some karaoke. 
[01:11:00]  We put the challenge out there to the listeners.  Your best karaoke.  Something tells me some of these aren't going to be the best.  Dude, I did so much better than that person.  Are we going to get the angry emails?  Nothing says good radio like karaoke.  Like a good karaoke contest.  Hello?  Is this on?  Hello?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Don't go to that morning zoo just yet.  Give us a chance. 
[01:11:30]  Come on.  Do you know I've never done karaoke?  I'm too scared to do it.  Are you scared?  Yeah.  But you'll get up on stage and do comedy.  And talk about anything.  Yeah.  But honestly, I'm too afraid to do karaoke.  It's just terrifying.  Actually, when we do late night karaoke at my brother's restaurant there, I can't get up either.  Have some fun.  Anthony has no problem.  You can sing.  That's why.  Oh, I love it.  You belt it out.  It's much fun.  I heard you last time.  You were genuinely good.  Thank you, Jimmy.  So that's easy for you.  I just want to get up there and sing a little Ace of Base. 
[01:12:00]  But I get too nervous.  She doesn't want to see that.  She doesn't want to get out there and sing all that she wants.  You know?  I mean, the song is meaning.  She wants a little baby.  She doesn't know what's going to happen.  You know the story.  Say, get into it.  Let's have a happy ending.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  I want to welcome you all here tonight to the Halloween party.  This is my karaoke?  Mm-hmm.  Am I in the contest?  Can I win?  Everybody knows this one.  Sing along.  In front of a thousand people.  Listen to this.  Listen to this. 
[01:12:30]  I can begin to know it.  I'm doing my, um...  But then I know it's going strong.  My milk diamond.  Impression.  It was the spring.  Then spring became the summer.  Girl's yelling my name.  Who'd have believed you'd come along.  Everybody.  Wizard outfit.  Yeah, I have my wizard outfit on. 
[01:13:00]  Touching hands.  Reaching out.  Yes.  Touching me.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Touching you, baby.  Sweet Caroline.  Good time never seemed so good.  Touching, so good, so good.  I've been inclined.  To believe they never would. 
[01:13:30]  But now I...  A little taste.  Samantha doing karaoke.  See, that's...  That's fun.  That's terrific.  And he did it once at FH Riley's.  We were there and he was doing some...  They were singing and I was very impressed with that.  He did Desperado and Wanted Dead or Alive.  All the hits.  I was going to say, all the karaoke hits.  All the karaoke hits.  I was like, this guy's a good singer.  Well, we're doing a MacBook karaoke.  All right, hold on the lines because we want to see what you learn from the internet.  But we kind of went down. 
[01:14:00]  We just took a quick lap.  So why don't we finish this before we get back on the highway.  MacBook karaoke.  We heard Anthony doing a great job there, right?  Thank you.  Well, we have to decide between these two people who wins a MacBook today.  Oh, there's only two finalists?  Well, every day we got a MacBook to give away.  Okay.  Is it Miriam Ferrara singing Take On Me by Ah-Ah?  Miriam.  Ew.  Miriam sent this in.  Give away.  I don't know what, what I'm saying. 
[01:14:30]  Say it anyway.  Another day to find you.  She's dying away.  I'll be coming home for you, love.  Okay.  Gone.  Me.  Gone.  Me.  I ain't me.  I'm.  Me.  I'll be gone in a day or two. 
[01:15:00]  Oh.  So needless to say.  I'm watching and protect me stumbling away.  That's Miriam.  Yeah.  Miriam.  Wow.  Miriam should win the MacBook, but the way it should be given to her is you should take  it in both hands by the ends and swing it across her face.  That's how it should be delivered to Miriam.  Here you go, stupid. 
[01:15:30]  Bam.  Yeah.  It's so sleek.  You could probably just wing it at her like a Frisbee.  Yeah.  And have it fly through the air and smack her teeth out.  Well, I love that.  Catch it like a dog catching a Frisbee in a park.  You can keep the MacBook if you can catch it.  Miriam.  So it's either Miriam or Ryan doing Living on a Prayer.  Tommy used to work on the docks.  Junior's been on track.  He's down on his lucky stuff. 
[01:16:00]  So tough.  Gina works the diner all day.  Working for her man.  She brings home her faith for love.  For love.  She says we gotta hold on to what we've got.  It doesn't make a difference if we make it all night. 
[01:16:30]  We got each other and that's a lot.  Gotta hear the chorus here.  Of course.  We'll give it a shot.  Oh, we're out of waiting.  Oh, we're out of waiting.  Take my hand.  We'll make it all night.  Wow.  We got to be honest.  We got a tough decision here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's either Ryan doing Living on a Prayer or, of course, Miriam.  Miriam.  Wow.  Take on me. 
[01:17:00]  I don't know what I'm saying.  Say it anyway.  Another day to find you.  Wait, which one is this?  This is Miriam.  Oh, this is Miriam?  Okay.  It's the record version.  Yeah.  Coming home for your love.  Okay.  Call me.  Call me.  I need you.  I need you.  She's gonna catch up.  I'll be fine in a day or two. 
[01:17:30]  Miriam should win a Commodore 64 and she's for Palo Alto.  Miriam, go f***ing your hat.  Well, it's up to us.  It really is.  We could either go with Miriam, the goof actor, or we could go with the guy with talent.  Oh, my God.  It says right on the website, best in quotations.  Something tells me.  What?  We're gonna get a day.  Right. 
[01:18:00]  Where there are no good versions.  Right.  I honestly, my vote here has to go to living on a prayer.  The guy did a pretty good job.  He's got some range.  Are you hearing what I'm hearing?  Miriam.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Say it anyway.  Another day to find you.  She's talentless. 
[01:18:30]  She's retarded.  Yeah.  For your love.  Okay.  Bye.  I'd rather give the MacBook to a monkey.  At least he might do something with it.  I couldn't imagine this woman trying to work a computer.  I'd be afraid she'd try to eat it.  Well, so you're saying.  Let's go to my.  Find her dead with an M stuck in her throat.  Let's go to Mikey in Bayshore.  We lost Mikey.  Mikey's screaming.  Give it to Miriam.  Of course, Mikey's screaming.  Give it to Miriam. 
[01:19:00]  Everyone's screaming.  Our listeners are jackasses.  I say give it to Miriam.  I don't know.  I'm saying give it on.  What was his name?  Ryan.  Ryan.  I say Ryan.  Ryan Crewer.  I say Ryan should get it.  Yeah.  I think Miriam should get an envelope filled with white powder and say, put your face in  this and breathe deep.  Well, it does sound retarded.  If we gave the new MacBook to Miriam, what would she actually do with it?  Yeah.  What could she possibly do with it?  Use it as a doorstop?  Yeah.  She'd have the camera on it. 
[01:19:30]  She wouldn't know.  She'd be walking around naked.  What am I doing?  You know, with a name like Miriam, she's hot.  Right.  She'd probably stand on it and go, why doesn't this scale work?  No numbers come up when I stand on it.  You know what?  You convinced me.  I wanted to give it to Miriam, but in the end, would she really use the MacBook?  No.  It would be a complete waste.  All right.  Congratulations to Ryan Crewer. 
[01:20:00]  He just won the new MacBook for singing, living on a prayer, sleek and sexy, and has everything  you need to explore all your creative possibilities.  I thought you were talking about Ryan.  Head to the Apple Store or Apple.com to check it out.  But Ryan Crewer is today's MacBook karaoke winner.  We got one a day to give away, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry, Miriam.  I kind of liked you, but you came in second place and you get nothing.  Sorry.  We'll have another winner tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show, okay?  I want to play Miriam's karaoke before we get out of here, though, one more time. 
[01:20:30]  Let's say hi to Keith in New Jersey.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I love you guys.  All right, Keith.  What's up, Keith?  I learned on the Internet on elevators that if you wanted to go to, say, the fifth floor  and you got people that want to go to the second floor, how to bypass their floors to  get to your floor by holding the hold door button and your floor at the same time when 
[01:21:00]  you go into the elevator.  Hold door.  Let's try that tonight.  And the floor.  That doesn't sound like it would work.  Well, that's supposedly, it's on the Internet.  It came from pretty reliable sources.  I mean, look, I'm, you know, poor out here.  Reliable sources.  There are no reliable sources on the Internet.  Have you tried it?  Well, I don't even live anywhere where I would even use an elevator.  I mean, I'm pretty poor, so.  Where are you?  Where's there not an elevator?  See, this just proved our point, by the way.  Exactly. 
[01:21:30]  This proved our point about that.  Thank you.  That dope from Imus' show talking about it now we're raising criminals because you  can figure out how to pick locks on the Internet.  Yeah.  And we said that you just want to see this stuff out of curiosity that you would never  actually try it.  This guy.  Yeah.  Why would he ever look at videos of how to bypass floors on an elevator?  That's right.  He gets in the elevator in his building.  It just says L on it.  Only works on certain elevators, not the ones at XM.  All right.  Thank you, Keith.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There you go.  That's what he learned on the Internet. 
[01:22:00]  Tim from New York.  What's up?  Hey, listen, I have a little bit of an issue with prescription medication.  Yeah.  And so I went on the Internet to find out about how opium is produced.  And you can actually buy legally poppy seeds of the opium derivation and grow them.  And there's explicit instructions on how to, like, extract the opium from the pods when  they're mature and how to grow them in a particular temperate climate.  Something tells me legally went out the window.  No, you're not allowed to legally produce it for the purpose of making opium, but you 
[01:22:30]  are allowed to produce poppies.  I mean, that's, you know, garden enthusiasts, I guess, really like this flower.  There's a certain type of poppy that's needed to make opium, and I don't think those are  legal.  I don't know for sure, but knowing this country and how we make laws against drugs and stuff,  I don't think the opium poppy is legal.  Well, they went, they had a link to certain sites that sell seeds, and sure enough, there  they were.  And I checked it on, what is it, Wikipedia, the particular strain of poppy that makes 
[01:23:00]  the opium.  It seemed pretty legit.  I haven't done it yet, because my problem hasn't gotten that out of control.  But when it does, that's my plan.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, good luck to you.  Yeah, let's go to Pittsburgh.  Mike, what have you learned from the Internet?  Hey, you know, you can take a $20 bill, take a disaster knife, and split the  end where the strip is, take a single-dollar bill and tape it onto the single-dollar, put  that dollar in a change machine, and you'll get $20.25. 
[01:23:30]  You can take the old $20 up to a gas station or store.  I'm not telling anyone to do this, by the way.  I am a little late.  Wait, wait a minute.  See, because out of curiosity, I want to know how to do this.  Say this again.  If you take an X-Acto knife, one of the art facts carried them around, you can split  the end of the $20 bill.  What do you mean split it?  I'm not sure what you mean.  You can run it lengthwise down the top of the dollar bill so that you're not defacing 
[01:24:00]  the bill.  You're just basically splitting it in half.  Okay.  Do you split the whole bill in half?  No, just the end that has a strip in it.  Okay.  That has that little 20?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a little plastic-like strip inside money, and so you split it there, and  then you tape it?  Yeah, you tape it on a dollar bill, put the faces so they're looking like the exact same  way.  Of course.  And when you put that in the machine, it doesn't read the bill.  It just reads the strip that's going through it. 
[01:24:30]  That way, you turn $21 into $40.  Never heard of that.  But how do you get your...  Don't you lose half your 20 each time?  I think your money is still good as long as there's more than half of it.  I think that's the ruling.  Yeah, if you cut it just right, you actually don't even cut the bill at all.  You can split it top to bottom.  You can go to a bank and give them a 20 that's been ripped in half.  And I think as long as there's a little more than half, you can get a new 20. 
[01:25:00]  I have a million-dollar pen with little million-dollar things, so I'm going to organize them and  take them to the bank and then retire on Easy Street.  Easy Street.  Do you understand what he's saying, though, Ant?  Yeah, kind of.  Is he pulling the plastic out of the bill?  No, he's just cutting the 20, kind of.  He's cutting about a quarter of the 20 off.  So your 20 is going to be missing a quarter?  A quarter of it.  No, I got you.  Like, let me see.  Let me see Dan's 20.  Just rip it.  We'll have to get one of these.  We're paying you too much. 
[01:25:30]  Ha-ha.  It's a joke.  See?  There's the strip right there.  Right, right, right.  So if you cut it here.  Oh, okay.  And then tape it onto a one.  Right.  And put it in the machine.  It's going to read it as a 20, so this guy says.  Oh, but you go to jail for that.  Yeah.  You certainly would.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, boys.  How are you doing?  Hey, Jared.  I have actually done this one.  It works.  You know those vending machines that have the conveyor belt for the soda? 
[01:26:00]  Conveyor belt?  A conveyor belt.  Yeah.  It raises up.  It drops your soda out, and it comes back down and feeds it into a little hole in the  side and comes out the front.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  So what you do is you stick your hand in.  You need little girly hands like me.  Stick your hand in the part where you take your soda out, and there's a door there.  You just hold it shut so that when the conveyor goes with your soda, the soda can't come out.  So then the machine spits your money back out, and what you do is put it back in and pick  the one you want, and if you grab the soda out quick enough, they'll both come out, and  it works.  I have a similar trick where you take your car, and you ram it into the machine, and all 
[01:26:30]  the soda tumbles onto your roof.  You take a Welch's, and you hit the highway.  Oh, my God.  It's a soda, you chiselers.  It's a really good thing.  $1.50.  No, but you're not doing it to actually save money.  You're doing it because it's like, look what I can do.  Get a freebie.  Because you deal with a more expensive item.  You don't put your arm up and block conveyor belts for $1.50 item.  Let's go to Billy.  Billy, what's up? 
[01:27:00]  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  I've actually done this one.  I've grown some outstanding tomatoes from the internet, if you take my meaning.  And they taste lovely.  I love the potheads are calling like crazy.  Oh, yeah.  So you learned how to grow wink-wink tomatoes in both dirt and water.  Yeah.  Both phygeotronically and organically.  It works really well.  This guy's got the voice.  You can use domestic seeds or you can go with seeds from overseas. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian?  Yeah.  Hey.  You there?  Yeah, let's go.  Brian, we've got to go fast.  We've got so many phones lit right now.  All right.  When I was like 12, I was watching the news and I saw a thing about porn.  So I was interested in it.  It was about Wavy Spice.  Did you ever hear about that?  Mm-mm.  I could come in and be all like distorted, but you could still see a nipple here and there.  I didn't know anything about that until I watched the news.  Oh, Wavy Spice. 
[01:28:00]  Like when you'd watch the – it would come out.  If you didn't have the channel, it would be like all distorted.  You could – all right, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  So what did you learn from that?  I learned that when I was 12, I didn't know anything about it.  I was talking about porn that I turned on Spice.  Yeah, the Spice channel was like the porn channel, and they taught you on the news how  to kind of detune your television a little bit.  So you could see a little bit of it?  So you could see a little more of it, but more staticky.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, I was just – I was on YouTube, and I learned how to make tasers out of disposable 
[01:28:30]  cameras.  Yeah, that could probably be done.  You need some high voltage for the flash.  Well, it builds energy in a cell, and you just have to pull the wires from – we were  doing it at work because it's a theater, and they leave cameras, so –  What are they going on?  We were just popping each other with the phase.  What, do they got capacitors in there just kind of build up a charge?  Yeah, and it's still like when you take the battery out and think you're not going to 
[01:29:00]  get shocked by pulling out the wires.  There's still a charge in the capacity.  Yeah, so we were getting lit up.  So many people get electrocuted working on televisions doing that.  They unplug their TV and start sticking their hands in there, and like the capacitors are  still charged.  There's still like 10,000 volts in your TV when you unplug it, in the old ones anyway,  the old big CRT tubes, and you just nail, poof, zap, and you're dead on the floor.  You know what I learned to do on the net, and I forgot to mention this, is you put something 
[01:29:30]  in people's – like in the coffee, like X-Lax, and then you put a bear trap in the toilet.  Let's say hi to Malik.  Malik.  Yo, O&A, what up?  Yo, listen, I got two quick ones.  Yo, this one right here is an old boosters trick.  You get an old, like shopping bag, like a Macy's bag, and you line it with aluminum foil,  and you go into Macy's, Lord & Taylor's, you just drop sweaters, jeans, everything in 
[01:30:00]  the bag, and walk out of Delta sensors.  Wait, the tin foil will stop those sensors from going off?  Aluminum foil will stop the sensors from going off, so instead of going in the dress room  and popping off the tag, the alarm tag, you just take the tag, you take the codes, and  you got money, you walk out the door, the alarms ain't going off.  Wow.  You learned that from the internet or from the hood?  No, that's from the hood, money.  Yeah.  The second one I got is kind of like the one you did, Opie, with the soda machines. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  You get a two-sided sticky tape and a dollar bill.  You put the tape on the end of the dollar bill, you feed it in the machine.  Once the machine takes the dollar bill, you hit the change lever, and you hit whatever  soda you want, or the change lever, your change is going to come out, you pull the dollar  bill back out, and you get your soda, too.  You do that like 50 times, you walk away with like $50 real quick, whatever was broke, son.  I love it, Malik.  All right?  Easy.  Peace.  They learn it off of the net. 
[01:31:00]  It's a little different.  We have no access to that.  I don't know the password.  www.something.convict.  Fontaine, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Hey.  I have more listeners than Howard Stern right now.  Oh, yes?  Well, we all know that.  I mean, no one's really talking about him anymore.  I know.  What's up, Fontaine?  Hey, the best thing I learned on the internet is how to fix your credit score, and there's 
[01:31:30]  a site that all three of us, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.  You can get to all the sites from here.  It's www.eatabullet.com.  He was trying to plug Jimmy's site.  Thank you, which is being worked on, so.  Oh, good.  So you go there, but under construction.  Yeah.  A bunch of people with hammers, nails, and two-by-fours.  One of Steve's guys is doing it.  Oh, wonderful.  Let's go to Pete in New York.  Pete.  You'll want to eat a bullet.  You can't get to anything. 
[01:32:00]  You click on the caricature.  All right.  Hey, Pete, what's up?  What's up, boys?  I learned how if you leave your remote control, say, for your car, in the car and you lock the  doors, you can call up somebody at home that has the remote control, your spare one.  You call them on your cell phone, you hold your cell phone to your car door, and the  person at home, on their cell phone, they hold the remote control, push the button, and  it'll open up your car doors.  And I have tried it, and it does work. 
[01:32:30]  But why wouldn't you have your...  Most cars have a spare remote control key fob at home, so maybe your wife, your mother,  your girlfriend, or whatever it is.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but I'm thinking if you have your key, you also have the, you know, the unlock...  A lot of the new cars, the key is actually built into the, you know, remote control, the  key fob, you know?  Right, right.  So let's say you lock your car, your key's in your car.  Oh, okay.  You have an extra set at home.  You call the wife, and you hold your cell phone up to, like, your car door, and then 
[01:33:00]  she presses the button into the cell phone, and your door unlocks.  And it does work.  God, I want to try that.  See, I just want to try this stuff for the hell of it.  It works off a radio frequency.  That's it.  It's a simple radio frequency.  But how does radio frequency go through a telephone?  Yeah, it works.  Doesn't matter where you are in the country.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  See what we're saying right now?  You could put that up to your radio, and over a telephone, and a person can hear what we're 
[01:33:30]  saying over the radio, right?  But you can't put a telephone up to the transmission tower and hear radio over the phone, or put  it next to an antenna of a radio and have that radio pick up.  See, I don't understand how radio signals are passing through cell phones.  It works, Anthony.  I'll give it a try.  We're going to try it at home.  I'm not going to say absolutely, but it doesn't sound feasible. 
[01:34:00]  Someone out there try it, and let us know if it works.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Kevin in West Palm Beach.  Kevin, what's up?  What's up, man?  How's it going?  Good.  I was on the internet, and me and my friends on a website, and some guy posted three ways  to trash a car, and it starts with Mountain Dew in the gas tank.  The engine starts, and it seizes it.  The only way to fix it is a new engine.  You can't clean it out.  The second, spray paint on the windshield.  It's really great, and the next day, you get to watch them come out and scrape it off 
[01:34:30]  the windows.  And the third is, if you need eight hours for it to work, you slap a piece of bologna  onto the paint, and the next morning, they come out and take it off, and the paint comes  off with it.  Just a piece of bologna on a regular car?  Yep.  Just a piece of bologna, and if it stays there for at least eight hours, take it off.  No Coke or Pepsi, does it?  No way does the bologna thing work.  It doesn't have to be...  I've done it to neighbors who piss me off, man.  It really works.  Does it have to be summer or anything like that, or no?  Not as far as I know. 
[01:35:00]  We did it in the middle of summer, but I don't know.  One piece of bologna for eight hours on a car, and you'll mess up the paint job.  Yep.  They come out and take it off, man.  There's a nice circle spot.  Sir, what if you only have liverwurst?  It's worth a shot.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yep.  That's Kevin West Palm Beach.  We'll step aside.  Does Mountain Dew really wreck an engine that badly?  I would think it would probably clog up your injectors, but there's a lot of sugar.  Seizing your engine up like that.  I figured your car would just do the do. 
[01:35:30]  Do the do.  You know, look, my car is surfing.  My car's extreme.  My car is skydiving.  Snowboarding now.  I can't even drive it anymore.  You know what I'd do because you just said that, Jimmy?  What?  Are you going to do the do all day?  No, we'd do this.  Anyway, I don't know what I'm saying.  What I'm saying.  Anyway, for another day to find you, she's dying away.  I'll be coming home for you, love. 
[01:36:00]  Okay, call me, call me, take me on.  You know me.  I'll be gone.  Not soon enough.  In a day or two.  Call me, make me.  Oh, wow.  By the way, Snopes.com saying that cell phone car thing is false. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, false.  So, there you have it.  He's like, I tried it.  Did you?  No, you didn't.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

Only a couple weeks left in the contest.  Somebody around here is going to win $10,000. 
[01:37:30]  I had a good week.  Four out of five.  Yeah.  Patrice picked all my games.  He picked four away teams and one home team.  My home team, the Jets, lost.  The Jets lost.  And all the away games he picked for me, if you remember on Friday, I'm like,  oh, come on, Patrice, help me out here.  I went four for five.  But I guess Travis is still in the lead for the $10,000.  Travis had 40 correct picks.  Steve at 39.  And then it goes from there. 
[01:38:00]  I'm middle of the pack.  I don't think I got a shot at this point.  But thank you, Dish Network.  A couple interesting stories in the paper.  Do you want to – actually, let me go to the phone really fast.  This guy, Rich, he's got to be BSing.  Rich in Jersey, what's up?  What's up, guys?  You learned this on the Internet?  No, my friend in law enforcement.  Okay.  What's the deal?  You drill a one-inch hole in the side of a tennis ball.  Uh-huh.  Put it over the lock assembly of an older Lexus and then smack the ball.  The air pressure lifts up the lock, and then you got a car. 
[01:38:30]  How do people learn this crap?  Put a hole in a tennis ball.  You put it on the lock?  Right over the lock assembly on the door.  Yeah.  It's an old key lock?  Yeah.  And then you hit the tennis ball, and the air pressure pushes the lock up.  Wow, man.  It sounds like it would work.  Oh, it works.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  Be good.  You're going to see what you can do when you take that drill and you go into a rest area.  There's a little hole between the stall doors. 
[01:39:00]  And then go, psst.  Yeah.  You can put a hammer and watch your T-cell count drop.  Let's go to Tommy in New York.  Tommy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I just tried that stupid thing with the key and the cell phone from my bedroom on the  second floor to my driveway, and it worked.  But then I told my wife to hit the key without the cell phone, and it still worked.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you're still too close to the car.  Yeah, yeah.  We need someone to try this where, like, the wife is at home or whatever, and you're at 
[01:39:30]  work already.  Do it that way, and let's see if it works.  Snopes dispelled it.  Yeah.  Not to cut you guys off, but I saw Patrice over the weekend.  And?  And he killed.  Yeah, of course.  Every time.  Every time out.  He was awesome.  All right, good.  He was great.  Great show.  All right, cool.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Hey, I want to say good morning to Detroit.  We haven't said hi to Detroit in a while.  They've got an interesting story going on up there.  Hey, Detroit.  Protests that Victoria's secret G-string display spreads in Detroit's suburbs. 
[01:40:00]  Spreads?  It's spreading like wildfire.  Oh, I'm sure it is.  Let's see.  Victoria's secret isn't sitting well with some residents in Livingston County.  Mm-hmm.  There's a do-gooder out there.  Nothing better than do-gooders.  A lingerie display at a Victoria's secret store in the new Green Oak Village Place Mall has  stimulated a boycott.  Oh, look at her name.  Stimulated a boycott, protest letters, and spun off picketers at another lingerie and adult 
[01:40:30]  novelty store in nearby Brighton.  Robin Blazak.  Hi, Robin Blazak.  A 46-year-old Hamburg resident.  Yeah.  Of course.  She said she was shocked by what she saw at the store.  Guaranteed she's a fat pig.  Fat pig.  Gotta be a slob.  Gotta be a slob.  Why didn't we try to get a hold of her?  Where's Robin Blazak? 
[01:41:00]  We gotta talk to Robin.  She's setting Detroit on fire.  She certainly is.  Maybe I shouldn't have said that.  Look at what she was...  Look what she was so angry at.  Yeah, she was shocked by what she saw at the store.  They had six mannequins standing in different ways.  In G-string stilettos and high-top nylons and skimpy bras.  And skimpy bras.  So, in other words, they had mannequins that were completely covered by lingerie. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  So, what's the big deal?  Because Robin Blazak probably can't dress that way.  Of course she can't.  She's gotta look and be upset at plastic people.  Because she's a slob.  It's gotten to the point where she's probably been so angry at just watching regular attractive people walk by.  And not being able to do anything about it.  That she has to take all of her fat aggressions out on plastic people.  On poor mannequins.  Mannequins.  What the hell do the mannequins do to you? 
[01:42:00]  They stand there.  Sean Valentino.  They stand there and they don't even miss a day of work ever.  No.  Ever.  The assistant retail property manager who manages them all said the displays have since been toned down.  Again.  Again.  Will you stop?  Don't give in.  Give in.  Can anybody tell someone who's protesting, look, I'm sorry, you're gonna have to live with it.  Yeah.  Just live with it.  Are they such spoiled brats that they can't just go make their opinion known and then just handle the fact they're not getting their own way? 
[01:42:30]  Why are people petrified?  Do you think Victoria's Secret is gonna lose money because they dress up their mannequins in skimpy lingerie?  That's what they sell in the place.  What do you think this woman's outrage is gonna do to Victoria's Secret's sales?  Do you think they're gonna go down if this guy told her to go crap in her hat and just leave?  No.  More people would be buying.  Of course. 
[01:43:00]  It's publicity.  It's what they do.  More attention for Victoria's Secret.  It's not like you're setting up like a scene where there's a guy mannequin and a girl mannequin and he's pulling one of these little things aside and, you know, going to town in the picture window.  Apparently, they would just, uh, well, her mannequins set up wearing the stuff they sell.  Blazak's quotes in the Detroit Free Press are just terrific.  They had six mannequins standing in different ways in G-string stilettos and high-top nylons and skimpy bras.  She continues, I thought, I can't believe they're doing this. 
[01:43:30]  And then she goes on to say, a lot of young women tend to look at the fashion industry to see what sort of image they should be projecting.  Yep.  I don't think this is a little thing.  It's like that pebble you throw in the water.  It has that ripple effect.  Like when you do a cannonball in the pool?  That's a hell of a ripple effect.  Do you know, this is the first time anybody has listened to this woman.  She, she, her whole life, she hopefully was being just told to shut her stupid mouth. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, the next line now, it makes total sense.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Complete set.  Finally, I can settle in now and understand the story.  Blazak helped launch, uh, helped to launch a letter writing campaign with fellow members of the...  Holy Spirit Catholic Church, asking for less racy displays and a meeting with corporate officials. 
[01:44:30]  She's, uh, uh, one of these church people.  A church lady.  She's a church lady.  She doesn't like it.  Look, if the rest of the people have to stare at Christ in that depressing state on the cross with the bleeding hands,  can you at least allow us to leave the girls?  And, and no one is complaining about that.  You know, he's only wearing a little strip of loincloth.  Absolutely.  My God.  Put some clothes on him.  Yes, cover him up.  Cover the Lord.  Why don't you start by covering the Lord? 
[01:45:00]  Can we put a nice, maybe Van Heusen shirt on the Lord Jesus on that cross?  Because I'm a little offended.  And some, maybe some shorts at least.  Because the, uh, that little loincloth is pretty revealing.  And you see the abs on that kid?  Oh.  Making us all jealous.  Beautiful.  People are going to look at their image and think that that's what we're supposed to be like.  That's what we're supposed to be.  Skinny.  Nude.  Crucified.  She is an idiot.  And by the way, a lot of young people tend to look at the fashion industry to see what sort of image they should be projecting. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Maybe they should be projecting an image of these mannequins because, uh, this country is obese.  Yeah, the country's never been fatter.  Robin.  So I guess that they're not having an influence on the youth of America because most, most kids out there are just chubby, are just chubbies.  They can't have it both ways.  I hear on the news, uh, that, yeah, this, uh, horrible, uh, image that, uh, the, uh, mannequins here in this instance, magazine, uh, ads, uh, magazine covers are projecting this impossible image for girls to, um, attain so they, um, get into anorexia and bulimia. 
[01:46:00]  And then the next day you'll turn on the news and hear about the obesity of America, how our children are nothing but fat slobs and they're eating horribly and they're all overweight.  What is it?  What is it?  One or the other.  Nobody wants fat mannequins.  No.  Ugh.  Big, would be funny though. 
[01:46:30]  Hilarious.  I would love to see.  Especially if it was a, big fatty mannequin.  If I owned a retail store, I would just have a fatty mannequin.  Just a fatty mannequin.  Big, fat mannequin squeezed into some crap.  Just trying to squeeze into some hot clothes.  All half nude.  Big, saggy ones.  You put piggy, little pig ears on it.  You can have the attractive mannequins pointing at it and laughing.  Laughing.  Oh, would that be great?  In their little G-strings.  Yeah.  They're chuckling.  She's wearing a big, fat muumuu looking all fat. 
[01:47:00]  Two sexy, Victoria's Secret mannequins just giggling and having fun.  Giggling.  And you know how the mannequins' hands look?  Yeah.  You could just shove a burger in her fat hand.  A burger and a shake in the other one.  No one has a sense of humor anymore.  I would shop at that store every day.  Every day.  If I didn't like the products, I'd buy them.  Just buy them anyway for the sense of humor the guy has.  Piggy ears and like pig clove feet.  Cloven hooves.  Cloven pig hooves. 
[01:47:30]  And out of the back of her big, fat muumuu dress, a curly tail.  Because she's a pig.  Sean Valentino, yeah, he said that they toned down the displays like Anthony said.  The community had some concerns with it, and we're working with them to see what we could do to address those concerns, he said.  We want to create a family-friendly atmosphere here.  A fat, family-friendly atmosphere.  But it's a Victoria's Secret.  I know.  How many families, how many fathers, besides really good ones, are buying their little daughters Victoria's Secret underpants? 
[01:48:00]  You want to come in here, honey?  Happy second.  You're right.  It's a Victoria's Secret.  You go in there, and you're looking a lot of times.  Who hasn't walked into a Victoria's Secret with their chick and seen the stripper shopping?  Yeah, the stripper's in there, and she's picking up some things for work.  Hair's all up.  Yeah.  That's what it's there for.  How many guys walk by those displays just crying, knowing their wives can't give any of that stuff? 
[01:48:30]  You ever see the P-whip jackasses holding hands with their fat, pig, Robin Blazek-like wives?  And they pass by the Victoria's Secret, and they can't even look in the window.  They, like, strain their eyes to take a little peek in the window, and they can't even do that, lest that pig smack him in his face.  I wonder how many times husbands and wives have been having merry, fun, mall conversations, and then they walk by one, and then, like, she's still laughing up ahead of him, but the fat on her upper back brings out such anger, he has to punch it. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, just, she's got the back boobs coming out, squeezing out under her bra strap.  Hey, we got a picture of her.  If someone could help me out here, the listeners are finding pictures of her.  Where?  Maybe we should be finding pictures of her.  Derek in Detroit, he's got a link to what she looks like.  Oh.  And he's saying, yes, she is a fatty, pig, fatty.  Yeah, of course, because no hot piece of ass is going to start this boycott. 
[01:49:30]  No.  And I'm not saying, like, you know, a hot piece of ass, you know, they, too, obviously, can be offended, but they're not going to be so offended they're going to start a boycott.  Of course.  It's always these type.  You can profile them.  As we get the picture up, just so we can check her out, there's another story that, well, you were talking about the strippers at the Victoria Secrets there.  Yeah, picking up some things.  Victoria's Secret.  Vicky's, I call it.  Just Vicky's.  I just say V.S. Hon, you want to go to V.S.? 
[01:50:00]  Sure.  And look at things you'll never get to fit into.  Great story in the Post yesterday here in New York.  Grinch charity shut out scores.  Dirty money.  Their money's dirty and they don't want it.  Scores, strip clubs.  There's a couple now in Manhattan, right?  I don't know.  I never go.  Well, they wanted to do a nice thing.  They wanted to donate some of the proceeds. 
[01:50:30]  The strippers themselves wanted to donate some of their proceeds because they make a really good living to some charities around New York City for the holiday.  Some of that skank money?  For the holiday.  Yeah.  And we've talked about this because we put out a CD back in the day.  Some of those stinky 20s.  And we were trying to find a charity for our dumb CD to try to do the right thing right around the holiday, too, matter of fact.  We got it out just in time for the Christmas shopping.  And we found out the hard way that there are charities out there that will not accept your money if they think you're like a bad person. 
[01:51:00]  You're like bad.  You're a bad image.  They don't want to be tied into the image.  But the bottom line is it's money and it would be helping people.  But they would rather just not associate themselves with certain people.  We're on in Boston right now.  Back in the day, we wanted to give money to the Jimmy Fund.  Yeah.  Which helps cancer kids.  For little cancer kids.  So the Jimmy Fund actually told us, no, we don't want your stinking money. 
[01:51:30]  Don't want your money.  We don't want your money.  Are you kidding me?  Your money's no good here, Mr. Torrance.  Isn't that amazing?  The arrogance of these charities.  Because the people who are advocates for the homeless or the women's shelters, they're not homeless and they're not in a woman's shelter.  So it's easy for them to say no to the cash.  We're calling a bunch of strippers giving some money.  Well, the bad thing was that at the soup kitchen, some of the homeless guys who had bad sight thought they were bringing them trout when they brought in the money. 
[01:52:00]  No?  Well, the story goes...  I could have worded that better.  Yeah, no, no.  Let me know.  No.  Well, the bad news is...  Well, the bad news is...  I got to tell you, folks.  I stink.  That was just a...  Here's a story from Elizabeth Wolfe.  Grinch Charity shutout scores.  The Jiggle Bellas...  Jiggle...  The Jiggle what?  It's a...  Jingle Bell...  Is that a reach?  Instead of Jingle Bellas, yes. 
[01:52:30]  It's the Jiggle Bellas at scores have been Scrooged.  Scrooged.  See, instead of...  Why would you just write it like that?  Because it's the post.  Yes, it is the post.  Dozens of charities have rejected the strip club's offers to raise thousands of dollars in cash and gifts for needy women and children.  To me.  Great.  You stay homeless because we don't want to take money from strippers.  Some whores want to chip in and help some kids and moms.  Right.  And they won't let them.  You know, you're a charity.  You should take money no matter...  Of course. 
[01:53:00]  Any way you can, right?  The ones that stole...  Meanwhile, they'll take money.  I guarantee if a bank wanted to donate money, they'd take it.  And you know how much dirty business banks do?  Washing money or taking drug dealers money?  You jackasses.  They'll take money from the Jews and the Negroes, too.  Well, I don't know about that.  Not the banks I go to.  I go to White Bank of America.  More than...  You have to smile and show your white face before they let you in the door.  More than 200 employees of the Mamory Mecca. 
[01:53:30]  The Mamory Mecca.  Including about 50 strippers.  So it's not even all strippers.  It's other people, you know, behind the scenes and such.  Wanted to donate money and gifts to a worthy cause this holiday season.  But every single group, except the Marine Corps, their Toys for Tots program, they said,  Hell yeah, man.  We'll take your money.  I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life.  Said Elda Orbach, a promotions employee at the East Side and West Side Clubs.  We just wanted to do something nice.  Our girls work hard and make enough of a living to give back. 
[01:54:00]  All our employees and patrons do.  I didn't know it would be this hard to give to charity.  Yeah, we learned this years ago ourselves.  They get picky as far as where the money comes for a charity.  Scores has regularly donated to good causes such as the Police Widows and Orphans 9-11 Fund.  So they've done it in the past.  But when they wanted to do something special this holiday season, they got the cold shoulder.  Orbach said the Coalition for the Homeless first indicated that they'd be happy to work with the club 
[01:54:30]  and gave them a list of shelters to contact.  But none of the more than 20 shelters returned their calls.  Great.  Can you imagine?  A church-run women's center in Jamaica, Queens also gave them a thumbs down saying the organization stood for the empowerment of women.  A woman's shelter?  A woman's shelter said no to the money.  Oh, my God.  What's more empowering for a woman than to waltz around and have a guy empty his bank account and hand you cash  and then go home alone and throw up in the cab? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's more empowering?  Do you church-going women think that you have more power than a stripper?  Than a stripper?  A stripper is taking guys' money and having to give nothing in return.  And not sleeping with them.  Yeah, not sleeping.  Just showing a little and then drinking, doing a little drugs and going home.  That's what they do.  No guy has ever cheated on a stripper with a church woman.  However, we will step over your bodies to get to a stripper. 
[01:55:30]  We don't care how long we've been married to you, how much we love you.  We will step over your sick and suffering bodies.  That's great.  Tell some woman she's going to have to take a few more fists in the face.  Right.  She can't stay at this shelter anymore because we don't want to take a stripper's money.  So go back home.  You have to leave and lose a few more teeth.  That is the ripple effect.  That is exactly what's going on because they're not taking the money from the strip clubs here in New York City.  That's exactly what's going on.  Some woman's going to have to get punched in the face. 
[01:56:00]  There is a black eye right now which could have been avoided, A, if she listened, B, if they had taken that money.  Two ways that neither one of them was happening.  Back in the day, we raised a lot of money for the charity that finally accepted our dirty money.  Dirty.  What was it?  It was the minority, homeless, veterans.  Veterans.  Veterans Association of New England.  Something like that.  Basically, black dudes that fought in Vietnam that are now homeless. 
[01:56:30]  They got our money.  That was the only charity that would accept our money back in the day.  Why don't we do a charity thing and we see who turns us down?  We should do something like that and just see who says no to the money.  Start with some real highfalutin' charities.  Why not?  It would be funny if the first one said yes, we had to pony up money for something we didn't believe in.  Damn it.  That would stink.  Yeah.  All right.  Big snay on that idea.  I only donate for abortions whether you want one or not.  By the way, over.  By the way, do we have time to do Money Snatch?  I hope so. 
[01:57:00]  Why don't we?  We should do it.  Are we doing it here or over at the other joint?  I would want to do it here.  Basically, we find women that are very, very needy this holiday season and they can't afford  Christmas gifts.  Yeah.  It's kind of like the old school morning zoo promotion where you throw someone in a bank  vault and there's money all over the place.  If they're really clever, they get the money blown around and the person has what?  Whatever the call letters are, that many seconds to collect as much money as possible.  Yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Those hack bits.  We do it a different way.  We have money all over the studio, naked women and leaf blowers and the girls just run  around trying to get as much money as possible, but they have to leave the studio with nothing  in their hands.  Yeah.  They cannot carry the money out in their hands or their mouths or their ears or nostrils.  I know some of these things we say over and over again, but it's definitely worth repeating. 
[01:58:00]  One of my greatest memories doing this radio show is after one of the money snatches, a  girl in the corner crying her eyes out naked as she counts her money and we said, what is  wrong?  And she goes, I could finally afford Christmas gifts for my daughter.  For my daughter.  Bravo.  What poor Toys R Us employee is going to have to count that money.  Absolutely. 
[01:58:30]  What just a great moment in Opie and Anthony history.  The fun part is when all the women at the end of the contest drop the money and then their  family dogs run in and immediately pick out the pile that was theirs.  Look, man, we can get this together really fast.  Who's doing it?  Are we doing it over here or over there?  I don't care.  I'd like to do it here.  I would like to do it here too.  Yeah, absolutely.  I say we could do it next Tuesday.  We got a week.  We got a week to figure this out. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  See you next Tuesday.  Because we got to.  That'll work.  Because we got to promote the homeless shopping spree this week and then maybe we'll get  the money snatch done next week.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree this Saturday.  Yeah, we're going to be live in New York anyway.  I don't know if other cities are going to pick up the show, but Saturday we do the homeless  shopping spree live.  The reason we're doing it on a Saturday, a lot of people are going to be doing some  mall shopping and we don't want the faithful listeners to show up at this mall and help  the homeless shop.  Yeah.  And then I guess we're going to replay the show for the people that aren't going to pick  it up live.  What time are we doing that on Saturday? 
[01:59:30]  I don't know.  And what mall?  Two to five, three to six, something like that.  Yeah, that's another reason we can't do it because it's mornings.  The mall doesn't open until we're done.  We'll have more details like tomorrow and later.  Maybe, maybe after the break on the homeless shopping spree, but it is going down this  Saturday and we do encourage a lot of the faithful listeners to show up at the mall and  help the homeless shop.  Okay.  And you can check out the whole, the whole thing right here on the radio.  Definitely in New York.  I don't know.  So maybe, I think Philly wants to pick up the show in a few other places and the ones that  don't pick it up, they'll just play the replay. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall, maybe one near you.  The Opie and Anthony show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas  presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition, enjoy the holiday spirit, and the stench of 
[02:00:30]  booze and vomit, as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony  show.  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, uh, do you know what time today?  I want to give a plug to, uh, to Nick DiPaolo who's doing the show.  Uh, my buddy, uh, comedian, uh, you gotta let you guys know Nick. 
[02:01:00]  What time is he's got a show today?  1 p.m., do you know how long it is?  1 to 3, a two-hour show.  1 to 3 here in New York City?  Yeah, so check out Nick here in New York on, uh, Free FM.  Very good.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  We were just listening to this during the break, and, uh, it gave us the old douche chills.  I was telling Anthony, you know, back in the day, when you, uh, watch those Rocky movies  and the music started, you would get the, you, the hair would stand up.  You'd get those tingles, like, oh my God, it's inspirational. 
[02:01:30]  Here comes Rocky.  Here comes Rocky.  And we were just listening to the trailer for the film, and they start up the music, and  I was getting that same feeling, but...  The new film, Rocky Balboa.  But it wasn't because, but, but, uh, we got it right here, we're ready to play it for  you, but, uh, I, I, I wasn't having that same feeling, I, I, it was like, more like douche  chills this time around, like, oh my God, no.  The hair stands up on your neck, and you get the shivers, but...  But it's not for the same reason you used to back in the day.  Different context.  Here is the trailer for the Rocky movies.  Can I see, I want to play a game.  How long into this do I want to spit in his face? 
[02:02:00]  Uh, I say...  The, the second someone starts talking.  Well, I, yeah, the music I'll tolerate, but I want to know, how long into this does  it annoy me?  Uh, not counting the music.  It'll be the second someone talks.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Anyway, what was, oh, uh, uh, and Sylvester Stallone was on, uh, Leno, and they showed a  clip of this movie.  It's god-awful. 
[02:02:30]  Aren't they saying the reviews are good, the people that have seen it?  Really?  I've, I've heard nothing.  His acting was god-awful in the clip they played on Leno.  And Leno, you know, he's a cool dude.  He was, he was playing it all like, oh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Yeah.  He couldn't really say anything.  That looks good.  He didn't say anything bad, but he certainly didn't say anything good.  He was just like, oh, I forgot exactly what he said, but it was that, it was that perfect  thing you say when you don't really want to commit to this.  Yeah.  Commit.  You just announced the project again.  Yeah.  So that's, uh, Sylvester Stallone in Rocky Balboa. 
[02:03:00]  Good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, that's a movie.  Here's the trailer.  Listen to this.  It ain't about how hard you hit.  It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.  Dude, Gerald.  Already I'm slightly annoyed.  Yeah.  Of all time.  If two athletes from different years could actually compete against one another, who would  come out on top in one corner, the reigning champion at Mason, the line Dixon. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  That's why does he have to have another stupid Rocky movie name?  Mason, the line Dixon.  Wow.  Mason, the line Dixon.  How about, you know, we would have got it if you just called him Mason Dixon.  You idiot.  How about Rocky, the hair, lip Balboa?  Oh, it's not about it. 
[02:04:00]  Rocky, the dead wife Balboa.  How about that?  Rocky, the butt kiss sex haver with her Balboa.  It gets worse.  I call Adrian with butt kiss and some peanut butter.  And I get rid of it.  So, so the, so basically the concept here or whatever is that there's a video game out  where you could like, you know, let's say if it was, if it was based on reality, you 
[02:04:30]  could have like Muhammad Ali fighting like, I was going to say Tyson, but now he's a, he's  a bit old, but you get the idea of there from two different eras.  Yeah.  Lennox Lewis or somebody a little younger, you know?  Yeah.  Well, Lennox Lewis is even.  As I said, I realized like dope.  Rocky Marciano.  Right.  So then you take that concept where you got the video games to see who's the greatest  of all time.  Let's say Muhammad Ali and Tyson.  But then Muhammad Ali is like, you know, screw the video game.  I could still fight. 
[02:05:00]  Let's do this.  And that's what this movie is basically all about.  Rocky now is like, you know, Hey, you know, cause they're making fun of him for being old  and stuff.  He's like, you know, I could still do it.  And that's what this movie is all about.  And I'm sure they have a training montage.  Well, smash Eric.  What you're about to hear is Rocky with Paulie in the basement looking for his boxing gloves.  Oh, no.  No.  Here we go.  This is all strapping. 
[02:05:30]  They're back there behind your dignity.  Oh, yeah.  They're under that pile of unread new ideas and scripts.  You see that pile of unread new concepts?  They're under that.  Just stupid.  What a jerk off.  Here it is.  Listen to this.  The reigning champion at Mason the Line Dixon.  He'll be pitted against the former two-time heavyweight champion, Rocky Balboa.  The computer says Rocky Balboa would be triumphant. 
[02:06:00]  Listen, listen, listen.  I think there's still some stuff in the basement.  What basement?  In here.  I think I want to, like, fight.  You know, nothing big.  Small stuff.  Like, locally.  What are you trying to prove, Pop?  I thought you might want to get involved.  Don't you think you're too, you know, old?  I think your brain's losing altitude.  We heard Rocky Balboa applied for a license.  You want me to fight a guy that I can beat with both hands tied behind my back?  That computer fight got a lot of people curious. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, but I ain't interested in getting, like, mangled and embarrassed.  People are going to think you're going crazy.  What's crazy about standing toe-to-toe saying, I am?  If this is something...  Ew.  Ew.  Okay, okay, just got him, just got him.  A douche?  Oh, complete.  I just went whoosh and got a bunch of goosebumps and felt embarrassed.  I only want him to say I am if it's followed up by an ass.  You are an ass. 
[02:07:00]  Wow, is that cheesy.  Yes.  Pile of unread, dusty, brand-new ideas that you've never considered.  Standing toe-to-toe and saying, I am.  I am what I am, and that's all what I am.  He's using Popeye lines.  He certainly is.  Green eggs and ham.  Oh, the cliches in this movie.  Oh, the cliches in this movie.  Oh.  Oof.  It's painful.  It's painful. 
[02:07:30]  I am.  If this is something that you've got to do, then you do it.  What gender is that person?  And who is that, and why are they using Adrian lines?  Is that his son?  His son's in there somewhere.  Gay son?  Is that a girl or a guy?  That sounds like a girl.  I think that's a girl.  That's probably the Adrian.  I mean, you know, Adrian didn't want to do this movie, so they killed her off, I guess.  Yeah.  Good.  So this is like the Adrian character, because you still have to have the Adrian character  if you're doing a Rocky movie.  The voice at the beginning was him talking with his son in the basement. 
[02:08:00]  And then, yeah, and then it was...  Well, it sounds like, what's her name from the Sopranos?  Not only, not Brocko.  Yeah, it does a little bit.  Oh.  Well, Rocky.  Rocky, you've got to do this.  Why do you think you still want to fight?  Shut up.  Yeah, shut up.  Punch her in the bread basket.  Episode wrecker.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[02:08:30]  That's what I hear, though.  Let's...  This is something that you've got to do, then you do it.  Doesn't it sound like her?  This is something you've got to...  It's Patty.  Then you do it.  Rocky, it's something you've got to do, then do it.  Punch her little chicklet teeth out.  You can flick her teeth out.  If you took your little middle finger and flick a whole bevy of her teeth, it would just  crumble out.  You know what?  Sean from Bayshore, you're right.  I don't care if Rocky is old, Pauly rocks.  Just from the one or two lines we've heard from Pauly so far, he sounds like he's still 
[02:09:00]  got his dignity through this movie.  Does he?  He's in it.  Yeah, he's in it.  Standing toe to toe saying, I am.  If this is something that you've got to do, then you do it.  Fighters fight.  To beat this guy, you need speed.  You don't have it.  You've got calcium deposits on most of your joints.  So sparring is out.  I had that problem.  So what we'll be calling on is blunt force trauma.  Heavy duty punches that will rattle his ancestors. 
[02:09:30]  Start building some hurting bombs.  Yeah, yeah, we plan for it.  Speaking of bombs, let's root for this film to go down.  And she goes, fighters fight.  Yeah, you know what else?  Actors act.  How about doing some of that, you bongoloid?  We get it.  We know, Philadelphia boy, you're overcoming it again.  We understand, Philadelphia boy.  Oh, jeez.  God almighty.  How about another cop land where you were an actor? 
[02:10:00]  Some hurting bombs.  Is that Apollo Creed's old trainer?  Yeah, Tony Burton.  Balboasaurus.  How do you feel about that?  It's a fight.  It's a fight.  Pay it, pay it, pay it, pay it, pay it, pay it, pay it, pay it, pay it, pay it, pay it.  Another good song.  This build has an exhibition.  They wouldn't have to call it an execution.  Takes guts to climb it back in that ring, knowing you're going to take a beating.  You can toss them over until it's over.  Where's their phone?  The 80s? 
[02:10:30]  That's probably in the 70s.  Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy.  He balboa.  Can you do it?  Oh, the cataract eye of the tiger.  Oh, wow.  Yikes.  Horrid.  I think that starts, what, Friday?  Or Thursday?  Just the fact that he's doing this, and he's doing another Rambo.  Does he have no one around him to go, that sucks? 
[02:11:00]  No, he hasn't had anyone around him in years.  He has the well.  That's why this.  He's got the well out back, and he goes to it every so often and draws the water.  In desperation.  And it's a little mucky, a little dirty, but it's still some water.  It was dirty by four.  Yeah.  By five, it was undrinkable.  And this is just, it's just filled with toxins and human waste.  That's what that Russian spy was drinking at the sushi place.  I was going to say, I'd rather eat a Taco Bell at this point. 
[02:11:30]  God, what an embarrassment.  That really is.  Let it go, action hero.  You're an actor, do something different.  Maybe another great comedy, like, stop, or my mom will shoot.  Worst movie ever.  Or Oscar.  One of the worst movies ever.  Hey, today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Give them a call, 1-888.  Get Dish.  1-888.  Get Dish. 
[02:12:00]  And just be.  You're a dish.  Be a dish.  What a tool.  All right, guys.  We had fun today.  If Stallone's going to be what he just is, then he should walk around with a little nozzle  and smelling like vinegar.  Get it?  Yes.  We got it, Jimmy.  We're not that dumb.  I'm excited.  That was good.  All right.  Hey, have a great day.  If you're not joining us over at XM.  See you tomorrow.  Okay.  Thanks.  The 2006 Eggnog Challenge will replay on Friday, December 22nd, the day after Opie and Anthony's 
[02:12:30]  appearance on The Tonight Show.  For video of the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, including the infamous Pat Fumunaki's Baby Bird video,  go to opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  We're walking. 
[02:13:00]  It's begun.  Someone looked at me all funny because I have a microphone.  I want to smack that guy.  Why was he sneaking pictures?  Why didn't he just take it?  He's making believe that the camera is by his side, but he's actually taking pictures.  He is a spy.  We must kill him.  Are you a spy, sir?  Are you a spy?  Yeah.  We saw you taking pictures. 
[02:13:30]  Why don't you just use it the regular way?  Because they didn't take any yet.  It looked like you were taking pictures.  I've got to get a picture of Precious.  Hang on.  All right.  Nice.  What the hell is that?  All right.  Let's walk.  That is an old camera.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Almost got hit by the UPS guy.  Holy shit.  What happened?  The UPS guy almost ran me over with his hand truck.  That would have cost him, boy.  I've got to buy rubbers. 
[02:14:00]  You've got to buy some condoms.  Dude, I've been using these fucking lifestyle.  They come in like a little circle package.  Yeah.  They're condom discs.  Condoms.  Those things are good, man.  Yeah.  It feels like you're wearing nothing.  Nice and thin.  Let's go get Jimmy some condoms.  Let's get me some bags.  You want some bags?  I don't know if they'll have them in here.  They have bags?  That's a drugstore guy.  No, but not the kind I like.  They only have the stupid Trojans and stuff.  I'm just going to call you a dummy.  I got to eat.  Where's the bags?  I have to go downstairs.  I think the pharmacy's in.  Oh, see.  Well, hold my thing.  Hold my thing.  Condoms. 
[02:14:30]  Condoms downstairs?  Thank you.  Condoms downstairs, sir?  You two go get them.  Yes, it is.  Which way?  Come this way.  This way.  This way.  This way.  How embarrassing.  Place his bag.  How embarrassing.  I'm in the makeup section.  Where'd you guys go?  Where are the stairs?  Oh, we're going to lose to Mike's.  You sure?  I get lucky.  Isn't it a line of sight?  Anthony, stay where you are because we might lose. 
[02:15:00]  Okay.  Oh, there's no way we're going to be able to broadcast from down here.  Jimmy, go get the condoms.  I'll wait at the top of the stairs.  Oh, there's an escalator that goes down there.  I'm not going down there.  I'll lose Mike.  I hope they have Jimmy's condoms.  Jimmy.  How embarrassing.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy's unembarrassable, though.  Did we lose Jimmy?  Yeah.  Must have lost him.  Oh, okay.  Hey, there's Chia Pets over here for Christmas. 
[02:15:30]  Just in case you want to get somebody something.  Can you still hear me?  Really don't give a shit about them.  Still hear me?  No, there's no way this is going to work.  I hear you.  I got to come back up, though.  It's already breaking up, and you got to turn the corner.  He probably doesn't hear me.  That Chia head looks like Screech.  We should have found a store that has condoms right at the cash registers.  Yeah, a one-story drugstore would have been good.  All right, well, we got to give up on Jimmy. 
[02:16:00]  It would have been good if he could, like, have a microphone as he does this.  Who buys appliances at drugstores?  Jesus Christ.  Where are you?  I'm, like, in the blow-dryer section.  Who the hell is that?  I don't know.  I lost everybody.  Oh, there's Jimmy.  How are you doing, Jim?  Did you get your condoms?  They didn't have the ones you wanted?  Oh, there you are.  We've just been wandering around the store.  One and one of these lifestyles, and they come in, like, a little circle package, and they're 
[02:16:30]  called, like, condom discs, and they're latex, too.  They're not, like, some of the ones that don't stop diseases, and these are really good,  and I bought them as a goof, and I've been wearing them with my chick.  Christopher Street.  I don't want to go all the way down there to buy rubbish.  What do you want to think?  I mean, Christopher Street buying condoms.  You know those are strong, because they've got to go for the ass-fucking.  They're thinking I'm going to get my anus filled.  All right, let's get out of here.  Nice load balloon for the ass cheeks. 
[02:17:00]  Loading the rear breech.  Thank you.  They're not the ones I want.  All right.  Why can't I find these little condom discs?  I don't know.  That sucked.  Yeah, I want to buy them for real.  I want to buy that and gum, so my breath don't stink.  Breath.  Our favorite magazine guy.  How you doing, fella?  Hello, miss.  How are you?  He just tried to buy condoms, you old broad. 
[02:17:30]  Sir, do you sell condoms?  Does she smell like pee?  Okay.  Oh, she's annoyed.  She has no socks on, and she's annoyed at us.  Oh, she's pissed they don't have what she wants.  What's she asking for?  Sir, what does she ask for?  Numbers.  Do they have the condoms for you?  Yeah, what kind of rubbers you got, sir?  I have a different kind.  That's the...  Oh, dear.  Oh, miss.  Trojan blue, lifestyle.  She turned around and you nailed it.  Should I see them?  Do you have...  Let me see the lifestyle, sir. 
[02:18:00]  Do you have the ones that come in a round circle?  What are they?  The little fucking square?  No, no, no, no, no.  The package is round.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm looking for round condoms.  Thank you very much.  Oh, careful.  Sorry about that, lady.  I gotta buy some gum, mister.  That's the only one I have.  So my breath don't stink.  See, Jimmy's gonna be doing some of that fucking.  Yeah.  And he needs condoms because you don't want to get a disease.  How much?  How you want now?  A bucket?  Oh, look at that. 
[02:18:30]  All right, let's go.  You don't want to get no diseases.  Thanks, sweetie.  I'm a bucket.  Nice.  All right, enough.  A savage.  He is, man.  He's a good guy.  He calls him a savage.  He's a good guy, man.  Fucking savage.  He's been nothing but nice to us.  Is he?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  All right, guys, stick up for the poor guy.  I don't like him.  I love when Jimmy says, thank you, nice man, and turns around and then just calls him a  savage.  The guy looks like Mr. Whipple.  He was a suicide bomber.  But he's one of the good guys, Jimmy. 
[02:19:00]  He really is.  You can't tell the good from the bad.  It's like the VC around here.  Oh, God.  Sell your fucking newspaper one minute and stab you the next.  Absolutely.  Oof.  Oh, this lady's talking to a window.  This is terrific.  We've seen this one.  She's crazy.  Is that a new jacket she's wearing?  You all right, lady?  Yeah, she's a crazy one.  You all right?  She'll run away.  Why are you hiding?  Yo, man, what do you need?  I was resting my feet.  She's just resting her feet. 
[02:19:30]  It ain't going to be like this.  We ain't the police.  What do the windows say to you?  We ain't the police.  What do the windows say to you, ma'am?  Tell her about the shopping spree.  Yeah, you want to go on a shopping spree?  You want to go on a shopping spree Saturday?  Free stuff?  What?  Um, we're the homeless, uh...  A nice mall.  Huh?  A nice mall.  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead what?  We do a homeless shopping spree every year.  We're doing it this Saturday, where we take a bunch of homeless people... 
[02:20:00]  You're going to take this, right?  Yes.  Okay.  But do you want to go on a shopping spree where, like, a lot of our listeners will come and  give you money, and you can pick out stuff, and you can keep it in a mall?  Like jackets.  We might do it in Jersey.  We don't know yet.  But if you're here tomorrow, we'll tell you where we're going to be.  And then we'll have a bus that will take you there and back.  We'll have a bunch of homeless guys that do it every year.  Yeah.  But I don't be over here.  Where are you going to be?  By the Exxon house.  The Essex house?  Yeah.  Well, we're not going to go pick you up. 
[02:20:30]  If you're in the area, we'll bring you to a mall, and you're going to get some free stuff.  Yeah.  What's your story, ma'am?  Yeah, where did it go wrong?  What's your story?  We like to meet the people on the street.  What's your name?  Where are you from?  Oh, man.  Where did it go wrong?  Why do you talk to windows?  What does the window say back to you?  No, I didn't talk to the window.  I was resting my leg.  I saw you having a conversation with the window.  Oh, I'm resting my legs.  It's always their legs.  Are you homeless?  I don't need this.  You're not a psychographer. 
[02:21:00]  You're not a what?  Psychologist.  I think she said psychographer.  Oh.  Psychographer.  Actually, Jimmy is.  I am.  Jim, is this your money you dropped, ma'am?  I'll let her go.  Fuck her.  She doesn't deserve anything.  All right.  I have to take her to the mall and buy her a kick in the cunt.  She's supposed to give me five bucks.  I'll plant my foot right in an awful box.  Man, that's our money well spent.  Jeez, that shoe would have to be fucking burned.  Try one more time.  Ma'am.  Miss?  We found a psychologist for you.  I don't need this. 
[02:21:30]  I don't need this.  I don't need this.  She's awful.  Mm-hmm.  Let me tell you something.  All right.  She's gone.  She didn't like Danny's technique, my technique.  I'm going to shove that thing up his ass.  All right.  All right.  I've had it.  We'll see you guys upstairs.  M202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe. 
[02:22:00]  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're loob.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM. 
[02:22:30]  Opie.  You know I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. 
[02:23:00]  guitar solo 
[02:23:30]  guitar solo 
[02:24:00]  What happened?  What happened?  I was saying the familiar sound of the listeners must be pissed.  Meh.  But apparently it wasn't on that long.  Not that bad.  We gotta figure it out.  Let's see.  Maybe on this side we get Pal Talk going.  Then people can listen in. 
[02:24:30]  That would be nice.  Okay.  Oh, look.  It was all set up for you guys.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Moink.  Oh, this is old.  Don't need that.  Don't do stuff really fast here.  Did we play the bull getting tased?  A bull?  They tased it.  You know, they are really loving that taser, those police.  Loving it.  Why would you tase a bull?  Uh, it's on the loose. 
[02:25:00]  Um.  I just...  Oh, the poor guy.  You know, I feel so much worse when animals get tased.  Of course.  Yes, and I do, uh, thank you, Kenny, when, um, when people get tased.  People get tased, it's a pisser-slap riot.  Animals, you feel bad.  Go. 
[02:25:30]  That is a long moo.  Screams like a human, though.  Oh.  Why'd they tase the cow?  I don't know.  I don't know the back story.  Uh, fruit and yogurt.  Not smoothie.  Wow.  Well, yeah, why would you tase...  It couldn't have brought that fucking thing down.  Hey, why is this chair here?  I want to see the video of that.  Did it bring...  Did a taser bring a fucking bull down? 
[02:26:00]  Danny?  Yeah, it certainly did.  It went down?  He went down hard.  Holy shit.  This thing was stiff as a board.  Until...  Did its legs just get out?  Yeah, it's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.  I'll try and bring it up for you.  It's really hysterical.  Oh, bless you.  That's funny.  Oh, poor guy.  He had big bull horns.  What was he doing in the bull?  Was he causing a big to-do somewhere?  Yeah.  What, would he get...  He wouldn't get out of the vehicle?  No.  You know what it was? 
[02:26:30]  He was misbehaving in the china shop.  Why would you bring a bull into a china shop?  Some items were broken.  The way they'd write it in the paper.  And the bull was quoted as going, I just wanted to look at a Hummel.  The bull was apparently a big Hummel fan in the china shop perusing and they were afraid.  Bull destroyed service for eight.  Is Roland here, by the way?  He certainly is with his medium shirt.  Everyone is saying you have to watch a video to see that thing fall over.  Who is Roland? 
[02:27:00]  It's him.  Well, Roland decided to do...  What's the deal with the Steve C impressions?  Why is everyone saying, oh my God, out there, huh?  It was Eric, though.  He was making commercials.  Can you do Steve C impressions?  And I was like, I guess.  You weren't asked to do a Steve C impression?  Yeah.  You can't even do a you impression.  I know.  Why do you look so fresh-faced today?  I mean, I don't know.  Did you get a haircut?  Yeah.  There's something different about you.  You did.  He got a haircut.  But he looks all fresh-faced.  I slept.  Did you tan?  No, I slept all weekend. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah?  But you're all clean-shaven and fresh-faced.  Yeah.  Your skin has a glow to it.  It does.  Did you get a facial?  Did you exfoliate?  No.  What did you do to your face?  Nothing.  It's shiny.  Yes, you did something.  You did something.  No, no.  Did you polish your face with cum?  No.  That's what we're getting at, yes.  No.  All right.  Soap.  So, E-Rock.  Oh, wow.  Pops right in.  He certainly does.  That E-Rock, he knows.  Bad sitcom character.  What's the Roland thing all about? 
[02:28:00]  We needed some extra material for the variety hour, and we were doing a bunch of Steve C.  segments.  So, I thought we'd get everybody in and do their Steve C. impersonation.  So, why can't we hear everybody's?  Yeah.  Because Roland's was actually the best out of all of them.  Everyone else was just kind of generic.  Doing the Jimmy impression of Steve that everyone does.  Right.  People just pick up other people's impressions of Steve.  Yes.  Steve even does an impression of me doing him.  Yeah.  But it just sounds like him.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm doing you doing me.  No, you're doing you. 
[02:28:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Here's Roland doing Steve C. Let's get right into it.  And now, on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour, Roland tries to do his Steve C. impression.  Hi, this is Steve C. You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  I can go to the dry cleaners to pick my leather Yager jacket.  Yahoo!  Holy s***.  Yahoo!  There's 10 rooms.  This is Steve C.  You're listening to Razzle Dazzle Hour. 
[02:29:00]  Has anybody seen my egg whites and potatoes?  This is Steve C.  You're listening to Razzle Dazzle Hour.  Why doesn't that blackberry work?  Damn.  Poopie.  I got nothing.  Wait a minute.  Who is that, Steve C. or Woody Allen?  I heard the Woody Allen too, Jim.  I was about to say that.  Woody Allen doing Steve C.  Having your hat blocked.  Steve C. Impression is always funny.  No matter who's doing it.  Steve. 
[02:29:30]  It's Steve.  See, people who don't know Steve, you can't see when he talks that his hands,  like, what did you say?  It looks like he's holding two giant bull balls in his hands and he's like jiggling them.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're out in front of him like he's carrying something.  Yes, but he has a weight in his hands.  Yes.  And we all know that weight is just a big secret.  And we all know it's no secret.  And he knows it too.  Steve, what's the matter?  I hurt my head.  I banged it onto a hanger this morning.  I see.  Tractors, same thing. 
[02:30:00]  Unbeat.  Oh, I played the wrong version.  We're on XM.  Jesus, here it is again.  Roland doing Steve C.  And now, on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour, Roland tries to do his Steve C impression.  Hi, this is Steve C.  You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  I can go to the dry cleaners to pick my leather yanker jacket.  Yahoo.  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  This is Steve C.  You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  Has anybody seen my egg whites and potatoes? 
[02:30:30]  Grr.  There you go.  This is Steve C.  You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  Why does my blackberry work?  Damn.  Poop-oop.  No, I got nothing.  Oh, my God.  It's kind of funny, man.  Steve C.  Razzle Dazzle Hour.  That Razzle Dazzle's really taken off, hasn't it?  It sure has.  Mm-hmm.  Steve C.  He's Razzle Dazzle.  Because he's so full of Razzle Dazzle.  And he's actually full of neither. 
[02:31:00]  There's nothing Razzle-y about him, and he never dazzles you.  And never dazzles.  Razzle Dazzle's no razzle.  It should be Rullard Dullard.  Roland, you see it?  And then he's in the booth just shaking his head like, you ass.  Shake your ass.  Looking at his blackberry.  Yeah, he was like, he's just working.  Whenever it's uncomfortable, he just looks up at the blackberry.  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  Same three emails.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  Love him. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, you see any movies this weekend, Roland?  No, I was feeling sick this weekend, so I just...  I just stayed in.  Honey, what's the matter?  Aww.  What?  Scratchy throat?  Yeah, well, yeah, I just...  That's what I had.  ...crap.  Then I just stayed in and took, like, Robitussin NyQuil and just passed out.  That's what I use.  Did you rub it on your chest?  No, they have a new thing where you're tossing your shower, like, tablets, and it vapors.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's a great idea.  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  What kind of cancer is that going to give you in a few years?  Do you think so?  Oh, it can't be good. 
[02:32:00]  You're breathing it in.  How do you do it, though?  It's like a tablet.  You turn on the hot water.  Oh, it's like a what?  Tablets.  Okay, I hear.  And you put it in your shower and you turn on the hot water.  Where in the shower?  That's what I'm getting at.  I don't know.  Wherever the water gets.  I want to go down the drain.  I want to go down the drain cover.  It comes out of the fucking faucet.  It comes out of the shower head.  Yeah.  It was invented by Germans.  It's called Cyclone B, you idiot.  It'll cure whatever ails you, though.  I'll tell you that much.  It works well.  Explain it.  It's like I just put the tablet in the shower, turn on the hot water. 
[02:32:30]  Where in the shower?  Just on the floor?  Yeah, on the floor, wherever the water hits.  How big is the tablet?  That big.  Radio.  About a 50 cent piece?  Yeah, 50 cent.  50 cent.  A 50 cent piece?  All right.  And you throw it on the floor like an Alka-Seltzer.  Like an Alka-Seltzer.  And then when you turn on the Vicks vapor.  Do you see like a vapor coming out of this thing?  No.  Did you see...  Does scary smoke come up to you?  No, you just smell the strong Vicks.  In the steam of the shower?  Mm-hmm.  In the steam.  Is your shower enclosed?  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  See, I have a shower, but it's got a curtain.  It's not enclosed.  I want to get an enclosed one with the glass.  Then you can do that shit.  Mine is completely enclosed.  And it is made of marble.  You're rich.  And it's got a glass door on the front that when it shuts, you're completely closed in.  It has eight jets on the walls and a huge rain one on the ceiling.  And one that you can grab and you can put on your ball sack and clean underneath your undercarriage. 
[02:33:30]  Do you have a...  Why don't you have a...  I'm surprised you don't have a little steam room in your bathroom.  Like you could do that in a steam shower.  I love steam.  You know something?  This thing might as well be a steam bath because a steam shower.  Because you could turn the water up so hot.  And it's set by temperature.  I could set it to 110 degrees or 111 degrees if I want.  Do you go that high?  And there's a bench in there.  With the water?  Yeah.  Sometimes you'd crank it up to 110.  And there's a bench in there.  Your body's all pink.  You're just like cooked.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  You got a pink bottom. 
[02:34:00]  Looks like you were just spanked all over for being bad.  It's wonderful.  And then you get out and my floor is heated.  So my tootsies don't get cold.  Ew.  I like to smash your tootsies with a fucking...  I like to hit your toes the way you would take a brick and hit those little...  Little caps.  Remember those little red caps?  You have to pop them with the corner of a rock to make them fucking pop.  Who wouldn't?  Especially when your feet are...  There's nothing worse than cold toes being smashed by something.  Like a good hammer claw running your fucking half-frozen tootsies.  My whole fucking life I spent with that goddamn shower curtain sucking in on me for some reason. 
[02:34:30]  Every time I took a shower, that fucking shower curtain would blow in and like stick to your leg.  What is with that?  I don't know.  Mine doesn't do that because they're heavier plastic.  Shower curtains.  Ugh.  I want to get the door.  Enough.  All right.  Let's go to Tom in Tennessee.  Tom.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  I love those tablets. 
[02:35:00]  Suit of care, man.  You put them in your shower, you're congested.  Yeah.  I'm all over my chest using them.  They're beautiful.  Does it just start leaking out of your head?  Just leaking everywhere.  Wow.  It clears you out real quick.  They're nice.  I've never even heard of this.  I just saw in Duane Reade.  I just didn't.  In Duane Reade.  When I was a kid, they used to, because I always had bad, my whole life had bad nose and bad  sizes.  They would rub on my chest Vicks, what was it called?  Vapo rub.  Vapo rub.  Yeah.  They would rub that creamy stuff on my chest and I would always. 
[02:35:30]  Chism?  Yes.  My father would apply it.  It would hit my hair.  No.  I would put it on my chest.  I would lift my little shirt and I would put my nose into my shirt.  Oh.  Breathe in the nice Vicks.  And breathe in the fumes.  Yeah.  Hey, does anybody remember when I was a kid, my grandmother, her magical cure for everything  was ST-37.  The fuck is she?  It came in a blue bottle.  Alien.  And it was a distant, it was like an antiseptic.  It would like clean out your cuts and stuff.  It was called ST-37.  Never.  ST-37.  No clue. 
[02:36:00]  Maybe somebody out there heard me.  We could have a fun chat about ST-37.  My man, her big cure for everything topical was Noxzema.  Noxzema.  And whenever I'd get, you know, huge zits, she'd be like, put some Noxzema on.  I'm like, yeah, Grammy.  That's what I need.  Some moisturizer on a zit.  Because that's what, you don't want to dry it out, God forbid.  Dolt.  Let's say hi to Jeff.  Let's say, oh, we lost Jeff.  You know, my grandmother's cure for attention.  My grandmother's cure for attention was she'd spit in her hand and pull down your little 
[02:36:30]  PJ bottoms.  And spit all over your hairless cock and then jerk you off.  And get you to sleep.  She wouldn't suck it, though.  That'd be incest.  Jesus.  Like, come on.  Just pop it in your mouth, Nana.  And she'd go, oh, you.  You're fresh.  Fucking halfway, Nana.  Come on.  Finish the job.  So, you didn't see any movies?  You didn't rent any movies?  Nothing, right?  No.  All right.  See that James Bond? 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  And?  You liked it, right?  Yeah, I loved him.  Oh, we got his review.  It was God awful.  You're a big Bond fan, right?  Not really.  Awful.  Oh, his review was awful.  No, listen to his review again.  What's your review of Casino Royale?  It was good.  I mean, it had action, suspense.  Explosions.  Suspens.  Suspens.  Suspenders.  Action and suspenders.  Suspens.  Suspens.  What else? 
[02:37:30]  Twists.  Surprises.  Twists.  Twists.  Turns.  Surprises.  Turns.  Intrigues.  Intrigue.  What else, dude?  Jesus, you're in the business.  I know.  I just...  That's what you expect from a James Bond movie.  I told you he's...  What makes this better than all the other Bond films you've seen over the years?  God, that's a great point, Dan, brought up.  Roland reviews movies like a trailer from the 50s.  Action.  Dispension.  Suspense. 
[02:38:00]  Intrigue.  Twists.  Turns.  Whenever he talks, big white letters should pop out of his mouth the way they would in  an Ed Wood trailer.  And spell it out.  Yeah, you're a 50s movie trailer.  You stink.  All right, keep going.  Just a different Bond, a better actor.  I mean, he's really good.  Kept the old Bond making stuff.  What?  Oh my God. 
[02:38:30]  What?  Wow.  Bond, you see him get his little gadget or something.  You see him get his little gadget?  What does that mean?  What does it even mean?  Why?  What gadget?  I don't know.  His Bond gadget?  His Bond gadget?  What the hell is his Bond gadget?  That could be a million things.  Go see the movie.  You'll see it.  Go see the movie.  Like he's in it and wants people to show up.  Like he's got fucking points on the movie. 
[02:39:00]  Producer, Roland.  So you understand we're using you to get some reviews out there for some of these hot flicks  and then the listener will decide if they want to see it.  Right.  Yeah.  So that's why you got to like really sell it here.  Based on your review, I did not want to see that fucking movie.  And it turned out to be one of the best action movies and the best Bond movie I've ever  seen.  Best Bond movie.  What was your favorite part, Roland?  Um, the boat scene. 
[02:39:30]  Well, you see him in the car and then the boat.  I mean, yeah.  The car and then the boat.  Were they on the fucking Staten Island Ferry going to work?  Oh my God.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  The car and then the boat.  I don't know.  It's...  It was a car chase and then turned into a boat chase?  Yeah.  He seems to try to save money, penny and...  Save money, penny?  Yeah, the girl.  It wasn't money, penny.  It was just the girl.  You kind of made a money, penny joke at the beginning, but that wasn't her name. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, well...  It was a different...  You thought that girl was money, penny?  No, I said from the joke from the other Bond's where he used money, penny.  Yeah, but it was...  Reference.  Her name is...  She's different.  She's not money, penny.  Any other movies you're excited to see?  Uh, seeing the Will Smith one tonight.  The Pursuit of Happiness.  What is that about?  Just, um...  It's based on a true story.  What movie?  I'm...  You lost me.  Uh, The Pursuit of Happiness.  Okay.  Uh, Will Smith plays this guy who's struggling with...  He's a single father, and he walks up to the guy, how do you get that Ferrari? 
[02:40:30]  And the guy goes, oh, I'm a stockbroker.  He goes, oh, I want to do that.  Then he goes, does it, makes a million dollars, and he's a millionaire now.  Is it a true story?  Yeah.  The end.  The end.  Oh, wow.  Full credit.  Does he end up driving around in a Ferrari at the end of the movie?  I don't know.  I've seen it tonight.  I don't know.  Possibly.  Possibly?  Oh, good.  Questions.  Twists, turns, injury, possibly. 
[02:41:00]  Kevin from...  Boat car.  Scene.  Uh, Kevin from Connecticut, rolling, doing the news.  Murder, corruption, weather, sports.  Yeah.  He just blurts out words that just...  They're really not very descriptive.  I bet when he fights, he just, he punches someone and pow comes off.  Like, how?  All right.  Kablow.  We got Nino from... 
[02:41:30]  Or Nino.  Nino from Jersey.  Nino.  Yeah.  Is this guy for real?  Yes.  Or is he like retarded or something?  Both.  He's real.  He's real.  And I've spoken to Roland off the air.  I don't think he's retarded.  But there's something about that microphone.  It's just, he's incapable of putting together an idea and a sentence and conveying to the  people, the listeners out there, what is going on in that head of his. 
[02:42:00]  Action.  Suspense.  All right.  Thank you.  Yes.  Dogshit sniffer.  Just fix it up a little bit.  Roland also liked the boat scene in Titanic.  So...  Yeah.  The boat.  The, uh...  The boat.  How would you, yeah, how would you describe the Titanic movie to somebody?  Maybe that's someone that isn't familiar with the story.  Wow.  A chip.  A what? 
[02:42:30]  A chip.  A chip.  A chip.  Potato.  A chip.  A chip.  Computer or potato.  Ponce or John, you idiot.  All right.  Or the big boat.  All right.  A chip.  A chip.  It goes sailing and, um...  Sailing.  Tragedy happens and the boat sinks.  A little story between five and a half hours.  You'll pass out.  Wake up and it's still sailing.  And...  But if the boat sinks, how is it still sailing?  Because...  They flash back. 
[02:43:00]  The director's cut.  The director's cut.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  They flash back.  All right.  So that's the Titanic.  Here, another really famous movie.  Oh, Christ.  How would you describe...  How about, um...  And you wore a shirt one day.  The Godfather.  Yeah.  I think he's done this one.  But how would you describe The Godfather?  Maybe someone's just moving to the country.  He's not familiar with our cinema.  How would you describe The Godfather to them?  Um...  Um...  A group of Italians. 
[02:43:30]  Mafia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Backstabbing.  Backstabbing.  Again, more action.  Intrigue.  Backstabbing.  Twist.  Turn.  Action.  Okay.  I want to know about this movie.  Have you ever seen Memento?  Yeah.  All right.  Could you please describe Memento to somebody who would never have seen it? 
[02:44:00]  The end of the movie starts in the beginning.  It goes backwards.  So, everything happens in opposite order.  It's like seeing the movie in back.  So, just backwards.  But what about him is interesting?  A Memento.  Yes.  He tattoos everything on his body to remember stuff.  Because he has no memory.  He has no memory.  Yeah.  So, like, we see so the girl goes, oh, yeah, that's Sally.  Yeah.  Hey.  But it's all in backwards motion? 
[02:44:30]  No.  I don't understand what you mean backwards.  The ending is a beginning.  And then the beginning is the ending of the movie.  How do they do that without it just being in backwards motion?  They just say, hey.  Coupon.  Oh, my God.  Hey, what?  All right.  Well, that's good, though.  I got either Lord of the Rings or the Star Wars trilogy.  Which one would you like to tell someone that has never seen these movies before, believe 
[02:45:00]  it or not?  Lord of the Rings, I guess.  You like Lord of the Rings?  Yeah.  Okay.  What could you tell someone that has never seen Lord of the Rings what the movie's about?  Small little midgets walking for 10 hours looking for a ring.  And then he finally finds it.  And then they sell on ships.  And you're like, what?  Pretty much.  What?  What?  What happens after he finds the ring?  He goes down to the dock.  He hops on the boat with the ring.  And you're like, oh.  They sell on ships?  They all do.  Little midget chips. 
[02:45:30]  Chips?  Chips or trips?  Chips.  They sell on chips.  They sell on chips?  But what was the ring?  You know, he has like a weird Mexican accent.  You're like, I Love Lucy, her husband, Ricky Retardo.  So, what was the ring?  The power for, I forget the power.  It's just like so long.  They just walk and walk.  It was so long of them just walking and walking.  That's a strawberry looking fucking banana. 
[02:46:00]  We'll have to see this, Kenny.  Might have to throw this at the wall.  A little too much strawberry, right?  It might be too much strawberry.  Too much strawberry.  All right.  How about, is it all right, Ant?  It'll suffice.  How about Jaws?  Jaws, it's been a while since I've seen that.  A shark in the water.  A shark in the water.  A shark in the water.  So far, so good.  Scares people.  Scares people, good.  Gary.  Richard Dreyfuss goes out, tries to get the shark.  All along?  No, with the other guy.  Everybody's free of his name. 
[02:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  Roy.  Roy, Roy, Roy.  Rogers.  Okay.  I don't remember his name.  But they go out there trying to catch the shark.  Two guys?  Yeah.  A couple.  A couple few guys?  Yeah.  Those characters aren't important, right?  Oh, yeah.  Well, they're like the green biologist type.  Let's see what the shark's activities.  The owner of the ship?  The orca?  That, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  What's he like?  Yeah.  I don't remember too much of the movie.  It's been a long time since I've seen that.  Wow.  I get a sore throat.  All right.  How about one more good one?  Mm.  Something basic.  Yeah.  Pulp Fiction.  Oh, that's a good one.  How about Pulp Fiction?  Come on.  Pulp Fiction.  John Travolta's comeback movie.  Yeah.  It was a good movie.  It had action.  Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious.  Action.  Hilarity.  Hilarity.  Killings. 
[02:47:30]  Killing.  Murder.  Injury.  Twist and turns.  All right.  What is it about?  Mm-hmm.  They open the trunk and you see a gold light.  And whatever.  What?  I don't know.  It's been a while since I've seen that movie too.  It's just they go out to do stuff.  They go out to do stuff?  They go out to do stuff.  That's great.  That could be like Pulp Fiction or the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  What about a movie that everyone has seen?  Think of one good movie everyone has seen.  Um.  We need one good one.  Something you liked that you really enjoyed that you'd be able to describe to somebody  because you enjoyed it so much.  Mm-hmm.  What's like some of your favorite movies of all time, Roland?  Rage of the Lost Ark.  All right.  What movie?  Raiders of the Lost Ark. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  Razor of the Lost Ark.  Yeah.  All right.  Describe that one.  Um.  Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones and he tries to find the Ark of the Covenant.  And he goes to different places and he meets his friend Salah and whips people and shoots  people.  Whips and shoots people.  Oh, my God.  It's unbelievable. 
[02:49:00]  Wow.  Was there a boat in Casino Royale?  People are saying there was no boat.  I was trying to think of what he was talking about.  But yeah, I assume there's, there was like a.  Yeah.  But it was inconsequential.  It was like.  All right.  That's good for now.  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  I, I would wish that if, if I had committed a crime, Roland was the only witness.  Absolutely.  No kidding.  Because I could just, it was a guy.  A guy. 
[02:49:30]  Bank.  Took money.  Getaway car.  Yeah.  What did he look like?  Legs and arms.  A head.  Menacing.  Scary.  Frightening.  Intrigue.  Action.  Adventure.  Is he, uh, nervous, uh, um, uh, yeah.  How much did he weigh?  He was, you know, like the size of like a person.  How much did he weigh?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Um, uh, he ran out.  What, what did he get into?  What kind?  Ski mask.  It was a car.  A note.  What kind of car?  Wheels.  Um, a grill thing maybe.  Uh, um, you know, errrt and broom, broom away.  Sirens and.  Okay.  Forget it.  All right.  Uh, Roland was, uh, little known fact.  I don't know.  You haven't really talked about this much on the show, but we all know that you used to 
[02:50:30]  work for Carson Daly.  Yeah.  You did some, uh, personal stuff for him.  Mm-hmm.  A personal assistant.  A PA, right?  Yep.  And you also worked on his, uh, last call.  Yeah.  For a while.  And Sam, uh, got the tape from you.  Yeah.  Well, pretty much I knew I had to give it to him or else I'd be fired.  Or I'd be, uh, raped.  Uh, pretty much.  Yeah.  Monsterjob.com.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got it from him.  Well, I asked him originally to bring me the tape. 
[02:51:00]  Hi, Sam.  He was on Carson Daly's show, so I got the tape.  And, um, I played, I played it and found some funny stuff from it.  I'm from New York.  New York.  But I don't sound like it.  I sound like I'm from fucking Mars.  Sam's trying to clear his throat.  That ain't helping.  Sam, what can you tell us about Roland on Last Call with Carson Daly?  Uh, he was known as Roland the intern, the super intern.  He ran everywhere.  He even ran to stage. 
[02:51:30]  Um, and they played keep Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland.  Wait, you ran?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  He came out and said he runs everywhere.  He was Roland the super intern who moves quickly.  Ew.  What happened?  You became fucking Roland the glacier.  Who moves nowhere?  All right.  And, uh, is there some good stuff here?  I believe there is.  All right.  So here's Roland on Last Call. 
[02:52:00]  The first clip is Carson introduces Roland.  Listen for Roland's How You Doing?  Yeah.  We have this kid Roland.  He's the nicest guy in the world.  He's been on the show before.  We've had him up here.  Works his ass off.  He literally runs.  Anything we ask him to do, he runs.  Let me just bring it out.  Where's Roland?  Roland, come on out.  Moving very, uh, very speedily, I see you there, as usual.  Yeah, I was always, yeah.  Yeah, you run, Deb.  You really do run everywhere.  Yeah, we run everywhere.  Yeah, that's great.  Are you still having a good time working on the show?  I'm having a time of my life.  Yeah, are you really?  Yeah.  And you got your Ed shirt on there.  You're a fan of Julie Bowens on the program. 
[02:52:30]  Big fan.  Big fan of Ed.  And Julie Bowens.  Would you like to meet her?  Maybe we can arrange that.  Yeah.  Yeah?  How you doing?  Yeah, right.  That was you saying, how you doing?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, yeah.  Oh, my God.  They wanted to hire somebody else, but Carson said, no, no, no, because I got a kid who'll  fall apart.  And you did.  Hence, Jeff Zucker goes, who is he?  And now he goes, he's fine.  He goes, get camera crew here.  Fall apart. 
[02:53:00]  He goes, all right, bring him in.  Yeah, they sent him to the Aspen Comedy Festival.  Oh, yeah?  He interviews Mike Myers here?  Yes.  Let's see how he handles Mike Myers.  Wow.  Yeah.  That ought to be nerve-wracking.  Huh?  I had to wait four hours for him.  And he makes the most of it.  Does he really?  No.  It was a longer interview, but Mike was like, he didn't want to do any interviews, but then  he goes, can I do an interview?  He goes, yeah, you'll fall apart.  I was like, all right.  Oh.  What was he pushing during this?  Nothing.  He was just there to accept an award. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  Here's Roland interviewing Mike Myers.  Hi, Mike Myers, I'm from Toronto Canada, and I'm five foot seven and a half in my fucking  teeth.  Okay.  I was wondering if you could do, like, an awesome line, I could do a fat bastard line.  Okay.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, my little baby.  I know.  Yeah, yeah, it's pretty bad, huh?  Great.  Yeah.  That's great.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, God, am I, I can't look at you.  While he's doing this, Roland is wearing a funny hat that he bought at the beginning of 
[02:54:00]  the segment.  Yeah, it wasn't me as a producer.  The interview was like four or five minutes, and then they took my fall in the park.  My little baby?  Yeah, what were you, what were you doing?  I, I did not want to do that, but then producer goes.  Do you think he wanted to do an Austin Powers impression?  Oh, no, no, he did not at all.  The producer goes, it'd be really funny.  We both looked at each other.  It's going to be bad.  He goes, just do it.  Wow.  Wow.  All right, well, here's Roland interviewing Michael McKeon, and he can't remember his 
[02:54:30]  name.  No, after he introduces him, he has to look at the camera guy, or producer, whoever it  is, to make sure.  The what guy?  Camera guy.  Holy shit, did you say it really?  Camera.  Camera.  He had to look at the camera guy.  The camera guy.  Pay attention.  New York.  All right, well, here's, and he forgot his name.  Yeah, he didn't know who he was.  Okay, here we go.  All right, guy.  Hi, hanging behind the bell stand again with Michael McKeon.  With Michael McKeon?  Yes. 
[02:55:00]  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I can show you my room key and everything.  Oh, no, that's all right.  Really me.  And then he asked him, with Michael McKeon?  Michael McKeon?  Michael McKeon?  Yeah.  Is that your name?  Oh, man.  Well, I had to interview Janine Garofalo, too.  Uh-oh.  That was my first one, and I was like, oh, I heard you're always bitter.  Just, like, joking.  That's producer.  Just say that.  She'll, like, think it's funny.  Oh, boy.  She went off on me for ten minutes.  It wasn't even aired.  No.  Oh, really?  No.  She was a cunt about it? 
[02:55:30]  Oof.  Yeah, she was just like...  Were you having?  No, it wasn't aired at all.  It wasn't aired.  It was like...  Oh, it aired.  The only thing you see me seeing that, I say, sorry.  She just ran away.  Yeah, there's just a clip of him shaking her hand.  It's not...  They wouldn't air it, though.  It just hurt.  What a cunt.  Oh, shit.  Roland interviews Kevin Smith and does a Chewbacca impression in this next clip.  Ew!  Ah.  Yeah, I heard you're a Star Wars fan.  I...  No.  No.  No.  Not really.  Not really?  We're a checker.  Trekker?  Trekker?  No, I like stars.  Yeah, I liked you. 
[02:56:00]  I thought you might want to know in college I won an impression for the best Chewbacca contest.  Did you?  Yeah.  Can I see it?  Laugh it up, fuzzball.  Oh, great, thanks.  That was pretty good.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  He just kept right going.  Kevin Smith's great, man.  Laugh it up.  Wow.  Douchebacca.  Yeah.  Johnny from Kansas.  Chew anything.  Yeah, no.  Johnny from Kansas.  It's like his movie review should be the $50,000 pyramid. 
[02:56:30]  Action.  Yeah.  Murder.  Intrigue.  Boats.  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  But you get a producer saying, ask these questions.  I'm like, oh, God.  It'd be great.  All right.  Wow.  You were a good boy, though.  Yeah.  You went in there and you're a go-getter.  Yeah.  We did a couple other ones, but, like, we did Kelsey Grammer in the bathroom.  We thought this would be funny, but.  He didn't?  No.  All right.  Finally, Roland tells some jokes on the street in Aspen. 
[02:57:00]  It's a comedy festival, so Roland is outside on the corner with a joke book in hand.  Oh.  Telling jokes.  Again, not my idea.  Oh.  With his funny hat on still.  Oh, God.  We have to have you do some of this stuff for the show.  Who knew?  See?  Look at him.  Oh.  The worst.  Look at his whole face collapses.  Oh.  Who knew?  Like he just ate a lemon. 
[02:57:30]  I'm having so much fun in Aspen.  I want to come back next year.  Maybe if I perfect my joke telling, they'll invite me back as a performer.  What did one hot dog say to the other?  Hey, Frank.  Hey.  Frank.  Frank.  Did you hear about a flasher who was thinking of retiring?  He just liked to stick it out one more year.  Stick it out.  Hey.  How many women with PMS does it take to change a light bulb?  Six.  Why?  Because it just does. 
[02:58:00]  They did a pad.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You're radio gold.  Yeah.  Oh, do you stink?  Oh.  You just stink.  I know.  He's like a sideshow attraction.  Come see him devoid of charisma.  It aired during like a prime time thing.  So I'm like.  Oh, dude.  It's entertaining as hell, man.  My parents were like, oh, God.  Why?  I am.  Yeah.  I got to see the video.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:58:30]  Got to see it.  I hear you were a lot thinner, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  I had to take off my shirt for, later on, Julie Bowen came out, and I had to take off  my shirt to give it to her.  He has body hair like Steve.  Yeah.  That's a Chewbacca impression.  Can we see your body hair?  No.  Just your back hair.  Look.  No.  It's like a chick on the couch.  Come on, man.  Let me just.  No, no.  Just a little.  Yeah, turn around.  Just show us a little.  It's a lot of hair.  It's a lot.  On your back? 
[02:59:00]  You got back hair?  That's why I don't need to wear a jacket.  You meant to get me in the war.  All right.  Let's just see it.  That's all right.  We've seen Jimmy's cock.  You can show us a little back hair.  Who gives a shit?  Come on.  Just a little.  A little.  You just pull up the back of the shirt.  We won't laugh at you.  We won't.  I sure you will.  All right.  Nah.  That's not.  Whatever, man.  That's not that bad.  Steve's laughing.  Give a hairy ass.  Possibly.  Sure.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's hair.  There's action.

Carson had some vision there with you.  He sure did.  Some fucking vision with you, man.  What?  I did four other episodes.  Four other episodes?  We'll get the tapes of those.  Gotta see those.  Bring him in, Roland.  Roland, Roland, Roland.  Roland. 
[03:00:00]  There he goes.  Roland, Roland, Roland.  Is it old school Roland, or is it Limp Bizkit Roland?  It's Limp Bizkit.  Okay.  Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'.  Keep rollin', rollin'.  Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'.  Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'.  Keep rollin', rollin'.  Intrigue.  Yeah.  Action.  Oh, my God.  Steve has to throw some together.  Yeah.  With just some of his adjectives.  Intrigue.  Yeah.  Action.  That's pretty good. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Right on.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll get into some other stuff in just a bit here.  The XM Nation Awards, we got some of that?  Yes.  What are they for?  I don't know, but it made USA Today today.  Did we win any awards?  No, I doubt it.  Why would we?  I won an award.  God bless you.  God bless you.  When's the Sam and Than show, by the way?  It was.  Oh, when?  It was Saturday.  How was it?  How was it?  Sunday?  Saturday.  Good.  I lost the day.  They didn't have the Paltor camera on.  They'll piss me off.  Why didn't you? 
[03:01:00]  I gave them all the info they needed.  I put them on the admin list.  All they had to do was log in as an admin and turn the camera on right up there, and it  would have been on.  And I got home, and I tuned in real quick.  I'm like, oh, let me check out the show.  Ah, nothing.  How happened?  We had to turn the studio over very fast, and Sam spent the...  He was using the wrong computer at first. 
[03:01:30]  I knew it.  At first, at first.  Yeah.  And then all our breaks were real short, too, and we were just trying to hammer together  a radio show.  All right.  Oop's already bored.  I kind of am.  Wait, I want to know what...  I want to know...  I wanted to know.  Yeah.  I wanted to know about your radio show.  Was it a hit?  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of message board activity.  There was a response.  I just heard the end about your favorite ghost.  No, those are the top five worst ghosts. 
[03:02:00]  Right.  Ever.  Who was on the list?  The Pac-Man ghosts.  The Pac-Man.  Casper.  Bill Cosby from Ghost Dad.  Oh, very nice.  Ghost Dad.  Can we hear that, Bryce?  Like a little taste?  Yeah.  Who else?  Elo heard the Than and Sam show.  Oh, yeah?  Maybe we get him on the phone to give his review of the Than and Sam show.  That would kind of be cool.  He's a radio show.  Have the guy, because he's like the head muckety-muck.  Yeah.  He's the one you got to impress in the end, man.  He's the big one. 
[03:02:30]  We don't mean shit.  All right.  Noted.  We'll get Logan on the phone to talk about Than and Sam.  The XM Nation Awards.  There's some interesting things in here.  They made a big to-do about it.  What are some of the categories?  Like, I don't understand.  Like, it's like, worst sports moment in 2006.  Oh.  Best XM sports play-by-play moment.  Who cares about that?  Ours you'd most like to hear as a DJ on XM. 
[03:03:00]  I know.  Most whacked-out crossover album.  I don't know.  We got to go through this and find some of the ones that people care about.  Best sing-along of 2006.  Ooh.  I like a good sing-along.  All right.  We used to watch sing-along with Mitch when I was a boy.  Mitch Miller.  Mother and I and father would all get on the couch and watch sing-along with Mitch.  Mother and I and father.  And then father and I would watch while mother ran into the other room to lay down with a colored boy. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, Pissin'?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's all take a leak.  Do you realize who you hired?  Opie.  He's a destructive influence.  Anthony.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What horrible evil.  Our new bosses said, uh, you guys can get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.  Opie and Anthony show.  It's psychotic.  XM 202.  The virus. 
[03:04:00]  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus.  All right.  Hey, XM did the XM Nation Awards.  I had no idea, to be honest with you, but I was reading USA Today, and right on the front  page of the life section, they were talking about the, uh...  Is that the blue page?  The purple page.  The purple page.  They had, uh, where is the...  We have a copy of USA Today, so I can read what they wrote about it. 
[03:04:30]  It's pretty cool.  It's right on the front page.  It's a nice exposure for XM, which we are a part of.  We're part of the XM family.  Uh, here we go.  Thank you.  It says, um...  Yeah.  XM Satellite Radio listeners have bestowed upon Kevin Federline, who Jimmy loves and can't  get enough of...  K-Fed.  I'll be K-Fed.  ...what may be his first award.  It's the Keep Your Day Job Prize for Least Favorite Celebrity Turned Music Artist.  Voters in the second annual XM Nation Awards also chose James Blunt's You're Beautiful 
[03:05:00]  as the song Most Beaten to Death and The Flaming Lips as Most Overlooked by FM Radio.  Uh, Bono was named Artist You'd Most Like to Hear as an XM DJ Beating Out Louis Black  by One Vote.  Louis Black's on fire.  He won Best Male Stand-Up, too.  That's, uh, that's a good exposure.  He's on fucking fire this year.  I bet that smoothie's gonna stink like mine did.  You think there's gonna be too much strawberry?  Those fucking savages. 
[03:05:30]  Let's get K-Fed.  Elo.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Elo.  How are you?  How you doing, guy?  Doing okay.  Hi, Eric.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  Good.  So, what'd you think of the Than and Sam show?  Do you want them sitting in for this review?  Wait, I...  No.  Holy Jesus.  Dude, I didn't touch a thing.  Wait, hold on now.  Sam and Van are now in the studio.  Fucking Elo has his own sound effects. 
[03:06:00]  Elo's got a sound effect.  You creep.  You're down there in Washington with your own sound effects?  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you?  Holy shit.  Nothing.  You lose.  So.  Do you play these during meetings?  Yeah, actually, what I have a whole thing if somebody walks in my office and they go,  Hey, Eric.  So it's wired to my side.  That's very important. 
[03:06:30]  Goddamn Elo, man.  He's like Alan Sniffen.  He's doing his own radio show there in the office.  It's Eric Logan.  Give us another...  The jingles are being cut as we speak.  Give us another example of how you use your sound effects there.  Boring.  There's a lot of...  There's a lot of that that happens.  Is that on your side or is that for people in the office who are listening to whatever spiel they're getting?  No, I've got to run through the system. 
[03:07:00]  People will sit in my office and they'll ask a question.  And a lot of times during...  Right now, we're doing all of our budgets.  So I hear a lot of this.  If people try to explain what the hell's going on with the numbers.  By the way, in case you're curious, I thought I had blown it when I was up there.  Remember, Anthony, when I reached over and car crashed myself?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's why I knew where car crash was on the Insta Replay.  Oh.  Do you have a replay machine in your office? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, I've got an actual replay machine in my office, completely loaded with 10 banks of 50 each.  I can't get one.  He knows it's right here on the corner.  Yeah, right here.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Boring.  He's got his own machine.  That's really funny.  All right, well, we got Than and Sam sitting in.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Awesome. 
[03:08:00]  Thanks, Eric.  Yeah, just curious, your thoughts of the show.  Dan, you take this one.  That's a good thing to do.  Yep.  Him asking you what you guys thought.  Yep.  I will admit we got off to a rough start.  Right.  I think we were a little distracted at the start.  Uh-huh.  A little too, I don't know, apprehensive about people calling in and messing with us.  Uh-huh.  And then I felt like we got a little better, I think.  At what point did you feel the show actually kind of got into its own?  Uh, Tony. 
[03:08:30]  When suggestions from Tony was a nice segment where we started building up steam.  Well, why don't you explain that?  Because I didn't get to, uh, you know, because I was at a Christmas party at my sister's house.  I mean, what's interesting is that they had a guy, Tony, come in.  By the way, he did a horrible job of setting up who he was.  I had no idea who he was.  Just like this guy named Tony appeared out of nowhere, right?  Okay.  So you need to, like, make sure the audience understands that.  So Tony comes in with suggestions of things that would happen, like, next week.  First of all, I think that's a little cocky to think that you're actually going to have a next week. 
[03:09:00]  Whoa.  So I think you need to kind of say, hey, listen, we hope this is something that can develop.  I mean, candor is an important thing with your audience.  Okay.  I guess insecurity is another thing we want to project as well, right?  Right.  Well, you know, having shown that.  Be as timid as possible.  Right.  Okay.  I'd start there.  All right.  I thought that was one of the problems.  All right.  All right.  You got that part.  All right.  All right.  Now, I'm just, there was a part about the suggestions for Tony where it was the drink,  eff, and fight.  Yes. 
[03:09:30]  Remember that part?  Yes.  Okay.  Now, you were encouraging people to call in with what they're doing as they're listening  to the show.  Mm-hmm.  And do you realize that on multiple occasions you were encouraging people to drink more and  drive at the same time?  And they would call in and go, yeah, we're driving, we're drinking.  And the response from you and Fan were like, oh, Sam was great.  Now, you do realize that it's a liability.  So you thought that was the good part?  It's a liability.  Is it really?  Yes.  Encouraging people to commit felonies while on the air over a national media on a federally 
[03:10:00]  licensed license that goes out is against the law.  Sam might debate on that.  He'll only hear it.  Sam.  No, I'm not debating.  He's jamming the middle finger out of the microphone.  There's no middle finger.  Ah, look how nervous he is.  There's no middle finger.  Don't joke here.  That was his thumb.  Sorry.  No, I don't remember specifically doing that, but I think...  Yes, I don't remember.  Well, let me help you.  Let me help remind you.  Dennis from full-blown age, when he called in, I made a specific note of this, how great 
[03:10:30]  it was, he was driving around drinking, and I think your reply was, oh, that's great.  Keep it going, buddy.  And it wasn't sarcastic?  It had to have been.  Hilo?  No.  It was very encouraging.  I'll have to listen back to that.  Yeah.  Maybe we can pull that and...  Yeah, pull that clip.  I think that'd be a good one for you to pull.  All right.  And then do it again.  Sam, I want to talk about your...  By the way, I thought that you had a nice little potpourri of places you went. 
[03:11:00]  You had the whole MySpace thing about how you kind of surf MySpace, which was kind of  pointless, but that was okay.  And then the suggestions from Tony was fine.  But the weekly Hollywood buzz, let's talk about this for a second.  I heard this now.  Now, this is a segment that I heard, and I had commented quickly when we were in commercial  break that I thought it was a little odd to have used a game show theme song as a Hollywood  kind of wrap-up thing. 
[03:11:30]  I thought it was weird that the Price is Right music...  It's one of my bits.  Oh, so...  So one of your bits is to have the wrong audio for the right bit?  Yeah.  I mean, if you're going to do the...  I mean, by the way, there's not a morning show anywhere in America that doesn't use the  hacky Hollywood gossip.  What theme music do you think they use every single time?  Jimmy just pushed his mic away and went, oh.  Oh, that was a rough one.  That was rough.  As soon as I heard every morning show in America, I'm like, this is not going to be complimentary. 
[03:12:00]  The point of Hollywood news and gossip isn't actually to report what's going on in Hollywood.  It's a bit...  It's also sarcastic.  It's like a parody of the...  I'm reporting the news, and Stan is obviously completely disinterested in the news that  I'm reporting, but I continue on anyway.  So when you guys talked about the Torrey Spelling yard sale, and there was hundreds of people  that were there, give me the parody about that, because you were reporting the news like  you were reading it from a magazine.  That would be me actually reading it from a magazine, and Stan not interested in it, as 
[03:12:30]  have to say, this is not interesting, but there's Sam pushing on anyway.  This is hard to sit through.  I know it is.  Okay, you just actually explained this to me, Sam.  I am more lost than I was before I heard the bit.  Well, Stan, what do you do in this bit?  He's trying to tell you out, Stan.  He's saying the bit.  He's basically saying, I did my part.  Yeah, I did my part.  Stan's part is to be disinterested, and obviously he was screwing it up, because I did my part. 
[03:13:00]  He did my part fine.  Obviously, the reason that Elo didn't enjoy this is because of fans' participation in  this bit.  Wow.  That's not what I'm saying.  You guys don't know how to handle the divide and conquer thing yet.  Yeah, man.  Listen, I've been working with morning shows my entire career, even shows as challenging  as the Opie and Anthony show.  I have never in my career ever heard either one of them sell each other out in the degree  this is happening in the first 10 minutes. 
[03:13:30]  I think there's some hyperbole going on here.  But, uh...  Hyperbole?  Yes.  Can you define hyperbole?  Exaggeration.  Can you actually spell it?  Yes.  That's Stan.  Is that your idea for good radio, Eric?  Spelling?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Did you just taser me?  Yeah, he did.  Okay.  He's tasered you from his office at Washington.  Oh, Stan ain't taking no shit!  I can tell you what.  You could actually spell check that entire show, and it would be entertaining. 
[03:14:00]  That was horrible.  Yeah.  Oh, he crushed himself.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so...  All right, so let's forget what I think.  Forget what I think.  I mean, what was the highlight for, Stan, you and Sam?  I mean, obviously you guys are clearly not on the same page, because you're trying to sell  each other out.  So what was your highlight, Stan?  I mean, what was the thing, when you walked out of there, you go, man, we nailed that Tory  spelling.  I mean, what bit was it that you guys really felt like you nailed? 
[03:14:30]  No, like I said, I think the Tony suggestions, it was good because his suggestions were awful  and made for good fodder for me and Sam to pick on them.  Right.  Sam?  I agree.  I think that was the one bit that we did best on.  That had nothing to do with either one of you.  It had to deal with Tony coming in and callers.  The bit was not...  Tony didn't make up the bit.  We made up the bit because we saw how funny Tony was.  We brought him in, and then we made him funny.  All right, so let's say, hypothetically, we're to do another Stan and Sam show. 
[03:15:00]  Yes.  And you guys are in my office pitching me on episode two.  Uh-huh.  What should I take away from the call now and also what happened on Saturday as to why I  should say yes to this?  I would say the major development areas, if I could use business speak, stemmed from  just that being our first show, our first show being live, and that there are things  that would improve if we were to give it another chance. 
[03:15:30]  Like, I'd say we had something funny to say about most things, and the problem was just  some of the roughness with having done our first show live.  Can I ask a question?  I didn't hear any of the show.  I was away.  How long was the show?  Three hours.  Oh, it was three?  Okay.  Why did you feel it started off rough?  It did start off rough.  I mean, why?  Was the jokes bad?  No, we were slow.  We weren't on the same page.  We had to go from topic to topic.  Stan was distracted.  I wasn't there for him as much as I did.  There's a very concrete example of me taking a stand on something, Sam completely contradicting 
[03:16:00]  me, and me going, yeah.  Oh, shit.  But, you know, that's not something that's going to happen every time.  Well, you go, yeah, why?  Because I was agreeing with him, disagreeing with me completely, because I was looking  at the phone or something.  In terms of the show having room to grow, there's obviously a lot of interest in it, regardless  of what the comments were.  The reviews on the message boards were definitely mixed, but the fact that they were mixed works 
[03:16:30]  in our favor because they were chomping at the bit to destroy us.  Furthermore, for a show to be on from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m. and have a 19-page listening thread  shows that there's something.  And the phone banks were lit.  It was seven people replying to every post.  And the phone banks were lit the entire night.  Ooh.  Sam wasn't going to take that fucking...  Sam would jump right in there and finish his thoughts.  Absolutely.  If I could add in something, Elo, I think after this discussion and your critique of the 
[03:17:00]  program, I think you'd be silly not to let them do it again because more people would  listen.  You just made them stars.  I think we should rename the show.  Oh.  This isn't going to be good.  I think we should rename the show Trainwreck Radio.  Oh.  Oof.  If we'll get us on the air again.  Oh. 
[03:17:30]  We'll take it.  Yeah.  Okay.  So now if we rename the show Trainwreck Radio with Sam and Sam, you guys will do it?  Yeah.  I mean...  Yeah.  But you're opening yourselves up to libel there.  Once we start rocking the house, people are going to be very upset when they turn into Trainwreck  Radio and it rules.  That's good.  It's not a Trainwreck.  It's okay.  Listen, I already have it federally copyrighted and trademarked.  You can't take it anywhere.  I'll own the name, so don't worry about that.  Website.  Hopefully you can keep it.  Yeah.  So now you guys willing to do another show?  Yes.  Ready and willing. 
[03:18:00]  You guys desperately want to do another show?  Very much so.  And I sensed a little of the terse sarcasm about the time that you had the show on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, gee, easy, Steve.  Wow, that was double, Steve.  I think the time slot makes sense considering our experience.  We were just saying that the fact that there were that many callers at that hour is more  impressive than if there were that many callers at an earlier hour.  Well, I'm willing to move the start time up a few hours to give you guys a little bit  more of an East Coast clear, as we'd say here in the biz. 
[03:18:30]  Well taken.  6 a.m.  Are you sure the method can handle it?  I'll sleep.  And by the way, it's the only reason I can't, because I can't stay up until 2 a.m. to hear  this crap again.  I'd just rather do it.  Oh, my God.  We could just send you an mp3, too.  No, I want to hear it live as it happened, because I was just as drunk as the rest of  your audience when I was listening.  I think we have to cut it down to two hours, though.  Uh-huh.  Two hours, by the way.  The first hour, bitching about the microphones, and what amazes me is two guys who produce 
[03:19:00]  this show every single day can't figure out how the studio works.  There was bitching about the microphones?  The room had to be turned, with all these problems, and guys coming in.  It's like, I mean, if you guys didn't have technical problems.  I just couldn't get the camera on.  The one, yeah, I'd say one technical difficulty was the, uh...  Paltok camera.  The Paltok camera.  The camera.  How hard is it to turn a camera on?  It obviously wasn't working.  Very hard.  He clicked send video, and then the video doesn't send, so it's not hard, but it didn't 
[03:19:30]  work.  All right, so the train wreck radio hour.  You got it then?  Yes, two hour show, right?  Cutting an hour out already, huh?  What's this?  This is apparently...  Must be some clips.  I want to hear your disagree.  I want to hear a fan going, yeah, I'm paying attention to something else.  I'm going to pull that.  All right, backing up there, Elo, when these guys were encouraging people to drink and drive,  you were saying?  Yeah.  All right, we got the clip.  Dennis from FBA, what are you doing? 
[03:20:00]  Tony!  Darren, dude.  Gunslinger from FBA.  I just got done four-wheel driving out in the desert out here in North of Vegas chasing  jackrabbits around in my pickup truck.  Atta boy.  All right.  Are you drunk?  Atta boy.  That's Tony.  Are you going to fight the jackrabbits?  No, I was trying to spotlight them with my shotgun.  Are you going to fuck them?  But it's kind of hard to do that.  Hell no.  All right.  Thank you, Dennis.  Well, then, apparently Tony thinks there's something wrong with you.  Dennis, get a hold of yourself, pal.  Well, that was Tony, who was also in the studio drunk.  The whole reason he was in the studio is because he didn't know what he was doing, and he's  the one who... 
[03:20:30]  He didn't even encourage it.  He just asked if he was drunk.  But that's encouraging, because if he responds and says, yes, you're encouraging, you're  sending signals about a guy driving four-wheel or chasing jackrabbits, and then asking if  you're drunk.  Well, if he replied, yes, I am drinking, we would have said, cut that out, sir.  It's irresponsible.  You're connecting the dots.  That's where you get in trouble.  That is where you have the encouragement part.  When the whole bit is called drink, F, and fight.  No, that was Tony's bit that we said was a bad idea.  That's why he was there. 
[03:21:00]  Let me ask you a question.  Did you broadcast it to a national audience, to the entire country of North America?  Yes, that it was a bad idea.  We did broadcast it.  That bit was a bad idea.  And then you asked the guy a question, hey, are you drinking, as he's driving through a  field chasing jackrabbits?  Yes, in terms of...  Okay.  I mean, you said yes three times.  The setup was that we were asking people if they're drinking.  He's crap.  Fucking are fighting.  There's just something funny about that, knowing he's looking around for the right 
[03:21:30]  button to close.  I mean, he's half listening to you, like, looking for buttons.  Yeah.  Doesn't even care.  Sounds like me.  Elo, how about train wreck radio today at 11?  I think we should just give it a shot here in 40 minutes, Opie.  What a great idea.  Van's saying no.  Sam?  I mean, if it's our only shot, then yeah.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Guys, come on now.  You were doing midnight on the East.  You're going to get 11 a.m.  11 a.m. on a primetime Monday. 
[03:22:00]  You get nothing!  I mean, listen, here's the thing.  I was pleasantly surprised on one, on a couple of fronts.  Ooh.  Sounds like we're getting set up.  No.  No, true.  I mean, I heard the Black Earl Show, which was horrid.  I mean, this was not that bad.  Not as bad as Earl's show.  Wait, Earl's show is not good?  Oh, God.  He's still pitching it, though, isn't he? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, he won't stop.  The Black Rock Coalition, yeah.  Can we hear some of it?  We've heard it over the years.  It's him doing all the black artists and talking about them and stuff.  Oh, I thought he did one on XM.  He did.  This goes back a while.  Well, we've critiqued the hell out of that.  It stunk?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was horrible.  I think you were filming Lucky Louis.  Oh, okay.  And what's the other one?  No, just the fact they actually got it done.  They got it done.  That would surprise me.  All right.  My expectations were so low.  All right.  Your final summary here.  I give them a passing grade and willing to give them another shot. 
[03:23:00]  Thank you very much, Eric.  There you go.  But you've got to understand, we've got to be tough on this.  I mean, this is the biggest channel on the platform.  We can't allow you guys to slack and phone it in.  Absolutely not.  That's just for the morning show.  I expect the prep.  I expect you guys to have it nailed.  So, the train wreck radio hour.  You know what you guys do?  Here's what you do.  What's that?  This is what me and Opie have done our entire career.  Yes, this motherfucker to death. 
[03:23:30]  I mean, do whatever the fuck you're going to do anyway.  And you'll be huge stars.  That's how it works.  We read you loud and clear, Eric.  There you go.  Good job.  Any other advice for the youngsters?  No.  Please call in for our show.  Oh.  All right.  Thanks, Hila.  All right, guys.  Bye, Eric.  There goes Eric.  All right.  Not all bad.  Eric, some criticism.  And valid points.  Some of them. 
[03:24:00]  But, uh...  Except for the legality thing.  We still think we did the right thing there.  I thought, listening to the clip, I thought if somebody's driving, and then even if they  say they're drinking, and it's them saying it, I don't think that's really you endorsing  anything or saying anything like that.  But that, he might have been, uh, you know, giving you a little, a little bit much on  that, yeah.  But, uh...  Did Elo really say that, say that he was, uh, that you guys were broadcasting to the entire  country of North America?  Yes.  He did say that.  Yes, he did.  So he might be drunk at his desk right now. 
[03:24:30]  Elo.  Elo.  I'll save you the button pushing, and I got one for you.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  That's easy.  And this one.  God damn rich country.  I wonder if he has that one down there.  That's, uh, that's easy for Eric to say, as he's fucking lounging around there on that  continent of Florida.  What?  All right, we'll go over some of the XM Nation award winners after the break.  Unpredictable. 
[03:25:00]  Unleashed.  Unruly.  Unwashed.  Unkempt.  I stink.  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees, and my shirt pulled up to my armpits.  Shut up!  No, who cares?  Simply, you fell for that again.  Damn you, Hawk.  All right.  So, uh, XM did the XM Nation awards.  We're looking at some of the winners, and some are, uh, worth talking about, and others are 
[03:25:30]  who gives a shit.  I was enjoying that.  Oh, the Aussie?  Did it on your iPod.  I already have it.  Oh, okay.  Mr. Christ, every other bed plays for ten fucking minutes.  I know, and the one I like goes in and out like a, uh, like a fucking cock in a pussy.  Like I got a ball.  The one I like goes in and out like a, but I saw a little different.  We're, uh, we're, uh, we're losing, uh, time in today's show.  What happened?  Uh, here's, here's one of the awards that the XM Nation, uh, awards gave out. 
[03:26:00]  Dream duets.  What?  Your dream duets.  I guess they gave the XMers, uh, a choice.  Oh.  I say, uh, my, mine would be, uh, Tina Turner and Mike Tyson's fist.  Dream duets.  Rock Hudson and Robert Reed.  Yes, Gary Glitter and Dakota Fanning.  There you go.  Now we're talking.  Well, they have a good idea.  Dream duets.  Uh, that would be Alice Cooper and Rob Zombie.  Who gives a shit? 
[03:26:30]  Seems a little bit contrived.  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, they're kind of, you know, evil.  Uh, don't duet.  Bad idea.  That would be Clay Aiken and 50 Cent.  Ah.  That's a bad prison movie.  That'd be a great one.  Are you kidding me?  Every time Clay goes to sing, 50-year-old shut up, faggot, and knocks him the tooth out. 
[03:27:00]  And just fucks him in the ass?  Not in the mouth.  Prison style.  It's more degrading if he fucks his mouth and he pinches his nose so he has to breathe  through his mouth.  He can't close your mouth.  That's how you fuck someone's mouth, by the way.  Anyone who knows an invalid.  And if you're like, I would love to fuck that invalid's mouth, but it's always closed.  Pinch the nose when they go.  You're going to jam it home.  Oh, you jam your hog in there and they don't do nothing about it.  Lay there like turnips.  Well, the next couple are much better.  Dashboard Anthem.  Best sing-along of 2006, according to the XM Nation Awards. 
[03:27:30]  Best sing-along.  Did you have a sing-along this year, Anthony?  Uh, no.  A new song that you just, was it toe-tapper?  No, I really, um...  Honestly, I couldn't think of one song.  Well, the XM Nation voted this.  Best sing-along of 2006.  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.  Good one.  You know this song.  Yeah, Northbrook.  Crazy. 
[03:28:00]  Even your emotions have an echo.  And so much faith.  Sing-along, though.  The hook.  The hook.  And when you're out there, without care, yeah, I was out of touch.  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.  Come on, hook.  La, la, la.  Here we go.  Does that make me crazy?  Oh.  Does that make me crazy?  This isn't a good sing-along, because it's too high. 
[03:28:30]  This makes everybody silly when they're driving in their car.  You drive it by yourself.  It gives a sense.  I don't sing along, but I do like it.  Do you ever sing along in your car alone?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Sure.  God, I would love to hear that.  Like, to a little drummer boy.  Yeah?  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum-pum.  I'm a poor boy, too.  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Ha-ha-ha. 
[03:29:00]  Stupid kid.  Give him the drum.  Look, you know what?  Give him a song.  Cheap fuck.  Hey, Christ, here's a drum.  I had no idea.  Tom, go ahead.  Hey.  I was just listening to your show.  First-time caller.  Hey, I love your show.  I'm Seth Riber.  I'm sitting here in Utah, and I was just listening.  And you said something about the dream duets.  Rob Zombie and Al Cooper actually did do a duet.  They did the song Feed My Frankenstein live together.  Oh, really?  How was it?  Oh, it was awesome.  Was it good? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Hey, where are you driving?  I'm in Utah right now.  Hey, you drinking?  No.  Well, stop off, get you a bottle of whiskey, and just chug it down.  That's right.  Ga-dunk, ga-dunk, ga-dunk.  And then hit a bridge abutment.  That's right.  I dare you.  All right.  That is a public service announcement from the Than and Sam show.  That's right.  Than and Sam.  Drink and aim for children.  Well.  Than.  Don't say that.  2006 XM Nation Awards. 
[03:30:00]  Thank you, Jimmy.  The award for a closet classic.  Closet classic.  Or guilty pleasure song.  I want to give out the award for a closet producer.  Stop it.  I thought he was bad.  That would be a guilty pleasure song would be Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamondwell.  Anthony Cumia.  Nothing guilty about that.  We played Anthony's version earlier in the show today.  I have a good version of Elvis singing that, which is fucking great from the 60s.  Really?  He introduced it.  A man wrote a song named Neil Diamond.  I have fucking Elvis singing My Way, and he runs it. 
[03:30:30]  He's like, we're going to do a number now by Frank Sinatra.  It's a number called, and you can hear the band member go, My Way.  And he goes, My Way.  And he's fucking, he's like, I don't know the lyrics to it.  I have to read it.  Hope you don't mind.  How do you not love Elvis?  Was he all fucked up at that point?  Oh, he had to be on.  He had to be fucking Pete Pill Popper at that point.  I think that was 20 minutes before the fucking, the banana peanut butter sandwich shit that  stopped his heart.  Before he attempted to flush the toilet.  That was fucking, oh, that's all he ate was these awful sandwiches with his, he must 
[03:31:00]  have had 100 pounds of lewds and shit in his colon.  He could have lived a lot longer if he had just gotten a colonic.  He would have turned 60, I think, last year.  I mean, he wasn't that old fan.  Oh, fucking Elvis singing My Way.  You got to hear, it's on one of the last live albums.  He goes, I don't know the lyrics to it, and then he goes, it's, and you can hear the  band member and go, My Way.  He goes, My Way is the greatest.  Oh, we got it.  Now I got to hear that if we could, you got it?  All right.  All right, here it is.  This next song was recorded by Frank Sinatra, and it's called My Way. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Well, I don't know the words to it, so I'll have to read it, if you don't mind.  And now, the end is near.  Oh.  Oh, take a dump.  The final curtain.  It's a shower curtain, your final curtain. 
[03:32:00]  As soon as you're looking at when he shits.  That's the last thing he saw, was a rubber duck on a clear shower curtain.  My colon's full.  I probably saw you.  Oh, who knew I'd die because of my Hershey Highway.  Oh, my way. 
[03:32:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, oh.  Oh.  Wow.  That's what I did when I found out the karate instructor was fucking my wife.  I don't know who I'm doing in impression of because it don't sound like Elvis.  Just close enough, ladies and gentlemen.  All right.  Moving on really fast.  Running out of show.  And Elvis.  Running out of show.  Here we go.  The song to be banned in the XM Nation.  Excommunicated.  What? 
[03:33:00]  They gave, I guess, the XMers a choice of songs.  To ban?  Yeah.  And the one they chose is Who Let the Dogs Out.  Oof.  I don't know that song.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I've never heard that.  Of course you do.  It's played at every stupid...  Remember this?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  If you went to the Caribbean, if you went on a cruise, if you went to Florida, if you 
[03:33:30]  went to any fucking baseball game, if you just heard this everywhere.  Oh.  Let the dogs out.  Yeah.  They want that band.  Woof.  Woof.  Woof.  By the way, I've heard that a thousand times.  I just wanted it in somebody's head.  Somebody right now, you're driving, and you're thinking of that song, I wanted that to happen.  Yes.  Uh, okay.  Wish you were still here.  Artist you'd like to have back.  Um. 
[03:34:00]  I would say...  Oh, I guess they have to be dead.  Well, my answer is not going to be their answer.  What would your answer be?  Randy Rhoads.  No, I don't think...  No, that's not going to be their answer.  No, it's John Lennon.  Oh, those fucking hacks.  John Lennon.  I mean, he was great.  I would love to have him back, but he's dead.  Would you love to hear what John Lennon has to say now?  It might be the same shit every fucking alternative rocker is saying about the war.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:34:30]  They'd be replaying Give Peace a Chance again.  His wife's fucking hairy cunt will be showcased somewhere.  It'd be great if he just turned into a right-wing Republican.  I know.  And just sang songs about how great Bush is, and people change.  Who knows?  You're all a bunch of baby killers.  Or the abortion months.  The award for most whacked-out crossover album goes to Sting, Songs from the Labyrinth.  Hey, do we have that again?  Here it is. 
[03:35:00]  Can't get enough of this.  Come again, sweet love does now invite my graces that reframe.  I don't even mind this song.  This is the best one.  Here comes the hook.  To heal, to touch, to kiss, to die with thee again.  That's a hard-ass song to sing, too.  Yeah.  That's because it's ancient.  Why don't you sing Ring Around the Rose, you're something-sting? 
[03:35:30]  But it's fucking-sting.  Pocket full of posy, ashes, ashes, we all fall down.  That's really funny.  I wish I had the courage during that fucking performance to just go, this stinks.  Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.  Jack fell down and broke his crown, and Jill came tumbling after.  And that fucking-  You might as well just fucking do that. 
[03:36:00]  That Gerard Depardieu pedophile creep he had fucking strumming the loot should have his fucking arms cut off.  I strum the loot, I strum the loot.  Stupid loot.  Why don't you strum a child's dick with your face, you fucking foreign creep, Nazi?  Yeah, we didn't have the balls to say it while we were there.  Of course we didn't.  Jimmy and I sat there like good little boys.  Fucking-  Wow.  Because Hugh Pinero was there, and Lee Abrams.  I know Elo would have gave his shit. 
[03:36:30]  I know Sting.  I mean, you can't fuck with Sting.  I mean-  God, did you just accuse him of being everything?  No, I wasn't accusing him.  I was just saying, like, I was just kind of being comedic.  In my opinion, I'm sure he's a good boy.  He doesn't fuck kids.  That's just my joke.  All right.  If he does, I like him more.  He could.  XM Nation Awards, comedy section, comedy, big schtick award for the most popular routine  or joke of the year.  Ah.  Have you heard of this bit?  I'm going to guess this is my bit about Islam.  Is it Jimmy doing his, and, is that it? 
[03:37:00]  No.  No, I think this is-  Oh, I know what it is.  I got it.  Yeah?  Fungus!  No.  Gotta be.  The winner is Franco.  It has to be.  Noah.  Um.  Aha.  When I hold the mic by my asshole and fart and shit.  Come on.  How could that not be?  It would be-  What is it?  It would be Craig Shoemaker and his Love Master bit.  Oh, I'm happy for him.  Are you about shitting me? 
[03:37:30]  I don't think I've ever heard it.  I've heard of it.  He's a bit he's been doing for years.  What is it?  I've heard of it.  It's his staple bit.  It's like Bob Nelson's football player bit, but not as famous.  Or as funny.  Well, I want to-  Do we have any of Craig's bit?  I've heard it.  Bill's got some.  Let's hear some.  He's the Love Master.  Um.  Oh, no.  The fuck is this?  Oh, no.  You know what this is? 
[03:38:00]  This is it?  It's like Bill Pellett.  I was walking down the street, feeling real incomplete.  Watching the babes go by.  Were ya?  One after another.  I heard them all mutter.  He ain't much of a guy.  Oh, no.  Well, my head started hissing that something was missing.  Oh.  Maybe I'm acting too young.  Holy shit.  You gotta be shitting me.  Stop. 
[03:38:30]  I-  So I walked down an alley to see a-  A singer named Sally.  Of course.  To give me some love advice.  And she said,  Listen, mister, don't get your head in a blister.  My answer comes quick as a wick.  To master life, one must master love.  That's the way you should think.  Okay.  Looking at you.  Oh, my God.  You shouldn't feel so blue.  You've already got what they're after. 
[03:39:00]  Forget about the money.  This one's on me, honey.  You've just become the love master.  Here we go.  Ew.  The love master?  Why don't you feel any different?  Oh, yeah.  See, that's his bit.  That's his bit.  Move over, robert.  That's his bit.  He puts on the low voice.  He says he's the love master.  Wait.  I want to hear where he goes with it.  Take over.  Does he say something? 
[03:39:30]  No.  You hear that ringing, baby?  That's the most popular routine or joke?  XM has some great comedy.  What happened?  I have more respect for the fucking decision-making of Jonestown.  XM Nation stinks.  As a nation, we do stink.  We're a third-world nation when it comes to taste.  Oh, Jesus.  What the fuck was that?  Would you ever take one of your bits, Jimmy, and turn it into a song? 
[03:40:00]  Could you do that, please?  Ugh.  No.  What, you know?  No.  Isn't it?  But he actually does the love master bit.  That's what I thought Bill was going to play.  And then that's the song that came out of the bit.  And he decided the bit was so good and so scary funny that it deserved to have a song made out of it.  All right.  Enough already.  The song most beaten to death by broadcast.  Yes, James Blunt.  You're beautiful.  You're beautiful. 
[03:40:30]  Blunt.  This is a big girl.  Female stand-up champion of 2006.  That would be Lisa Lampanelli.  She had a good year.  Yeah, I mean, look.  As far as what women comics are doing, at least she's up there fucking brutalizing people.  So, good for her.  She also won Most Black Cock.  That's true.  She beat out Robin Givens.  She, uh...  And, you know, she's fucking...  She does a lot of racial jokes and stuff like that.  And she does them on TV.  And she does what she wants, so...  Yep.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chuck in South Dakota.  Chuck, what's up? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, that Craig Shoemaker, if you guys listen to his bit, not that music crap.  It's actually a pretty good bit.  Well, do we have the bit, Bill?  That's what I thought you were going to play.  No, that was out of Bill's iPod, so I don't know where...  All right, here's the actual bit.  It's actually pretty funny.  So, this is funnier than the song we just heard.  Let's, uh...  Okay.  All right.  What are you laughing at?  I'm the love master, Bill.  Yeah, catchphrase.  Oh, it's a stairway to heaven.  Don't you laugh at the love master, baby? 
[03:41:30]  I'm warning you.  I can chip your tooth from right here, baby.  I'm as hard as Chinese algebra.  That's right, Bill.  Stop that for a minute.  Stop that.  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  No.  No.  As hard as Chinese algebra.  Well, that caller said that it was funnier than the song.  No.  Well, maybe there's a better...  He didn't say that.  No.  Is there a part where he says more chins than a Chinese phone book?  Ugh.  Got more chins than John Liu's office. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, my God.  That's one of the hackiest...  Oh, my God.  Let's hear another line.  Let's hear another line.  Maybe it was just one.  Yeah.  Master, master, love, baby.  Yeah.  What are you laughing at back there?  I'll stir your drink from right here.  Yeah.  I got a drink.  It's a penis colossus.  That's right, baby.  Yeah.  You want to take a picture?  Set that camera on panorama, baby.  Yeah.  I'd show it to you, but it's caught in my shoe. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  I'm the love master, baby.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  I'll flip you so much, you'll think you're at IHOP.  That's right, baby.  Yeah.  I'll have your knees knocking like a Jehovah's Witness on a pledge drive.  That's right, baby.  Yeah.  One night with me, baby, you'll be sweating like Jessica Simpson taking the SATs.  That's right.  Oh, no.  Master, master, love, baby. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, I got four inches right.  My stomach right now is dropping like a pregnant Lacey with a baby in her belly.  Oh, yeah.  Does that make you embarrassed to be in the business?  It's just, to me, it's just, it's like, oh, dude, I know you want to be clean and family  friendly, but what you could, like, I'll stir you, I'll flip you so much you'll be at an IHOP.  What does that mean? 
[03:43:30]  They flip the pancakes, they're not the people.  See, it doesn't...  But why would you think, like, all right, this guy's fucking me really well, and he's turning  me in different positions.  I must be in an international house of pancakes.  I don't get it.  It's like, again, that's, again, you want to be clean for tea, but...  No, this is just bad.  It's hack.  It's fucking old shit.  I'll knock your tooth out?  Well, he's going to be on our show soon.  No, he's not.  No.  Even a big cock hitting your face, wouldn't, would that knock your tooth out? 
[03:44:00]  No.  Knock anyone's tooth out?  A cock is generally, even when it's hard, technically, it's still soft.  I've watched a lot of porn, I've seen a lot of cock slapping, I've never seen a tooth  come out, unless maybe she had gums cancer.  If you hit somebody, like, you should say, if you got cancer, the gums, I'll knock your  tooth out.  I'll knock your tooth out, baby.  But you can do that with anything.  All right, well, you want to hear more?  Let's hear more.  Please, please.  Something about, he has four inches of what?  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, some women don't like it that wide. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, four inches of what?  Yeah, that's right, yeah.  You think it's a fairy tale?  Yeah, well, puff the magic dragon, baby.  What does that mean?  Come on and tell Pinocchio a lie.  Okay.  I'm the magic beans, dog, baby.  Fee, five, foe, fum, lay on down, and I'll make you.  You know what I'm going to do, baby.  Oh, say it.  Say it.  Oh, baby, I love you so good, your neighbor will have a smoke. 
[03:45:00]  That's right.  I love you so good.  I did a girl so good, the police came three times.  That's right, baby.  I'm the...  He's doing a Negro voice also?  Yeah.  We didn't even notice that through the bad material.  I believe he's doing a Negro voice.  How long has this been?  Because someone is actually telling us to listen to the whole thing.  It's funny.  Fee, five, foe.  No, he's not.  I like the way he wouldn't say come.  How much longer?  Two and a half more minutes.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus Christ.  How is... 
[03:45:30]  Where did he go?  He left.  He ran away.  You motherfucker.  This doesn't get funny.  Fee, five.  And that call was from Oklahoma.  The Midwest, you people, you better step up because other people are making you look  bad.  That is not funny.  Yeah.  Especially when you say, I love you so good, your neighbor will have a smoke.  How about fuck?  Come on, man.  You're doing a whole bit about being a great fuck.  It's a big cock.  It's a big dick joke.  Let's do it.  It's a big dick joke you're doing. 
[03:46:00]  That's not harder to be clean when you're doing that.  It's not harder.  It's harder to be really original and really funny.  And it's like, conceptually, maybe the bit's a good idea, but...  All right.  Well, why don't we listen a little more?  It's supposed to get a little...  It's supposed to get funny.  The whole catchphrase.  Let's go.  I love you.  So good, your neighbor will have a smoke.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  I did a girl so good, the police came three times.  That's right, baby.  I'm the love master, baby.  Well, yeah, you can go to school on me, baby. 
[03:46:30]  I will graduate magna cum laude.  That's right, baby.  Can you dig it?  Yeah.  What are you laughing?  You like French food?  Well, bon appetit, baby.  Yeah, we'll have safe sex.  Go get me a hefty bag.  Yeah.  Well, hey, you into Star Wars?  Come on up here and chew Bacca.  Oh, no.  No, he didn't.  We got to stop that for a second.  Mike from Canada just doesn't get what we're all about. 
[03:47:00]  Mike in Canada, what's up?  Hey, man, it seems like you guys, it seems like you guys hate anybody who might get over  in the Midwest or in the fucking South.  No, we don't.  Any, any, any?  No, we don't.  No, we don't.  You're wrong.  Well, listen.  You're wrong.  Okay, okay, I'm wrong.  Check this out.  I've heard that guy a lot on the Comedy Channel.  Of course you have.  I know, and that means I'm a fucking Midwestern.  No, go ahead.  This means you're a dope.  Jim, I love you.  Richard Pryor's from the Midwest, you jackass. 
[03:47:30]  It's nothing against the Midwest.  Pryor's from Peoria, Illinois.  Okay, and fucking Richard Pryor's the exception to the rule, and he's a legend, okay?  I'm not saying nobody funny came out of the Midwest, but it seems, Jim, like anybody  that's not a fucking comedy seller comic from New York, you fucking shit on them.  Really?  Really stupid?  Like Brian Regan?  Like Brian Regan, who I always say is great?  What are you talking about?  Jim, what are you talking about?  Brian Regan is a regular on our show, by the way.  There's a lot of guys out there, like Schumacher, who's a funny, he's a funny fucking guy. 
[03:48:00]  Dude, this is hack.  Dude, I didn't say he's not a funny guy.  I don't know his act.  I'm going by what I'm hearing right now is not good.  Harder than Chinese algebra.  Harder than Chinese algebra?  You're going to say that isn't a fucking hack old joke, dude?  It might, maybe it's kind of fucking hack, but it can still be funny.  Kind of, no.  Admit it, that is an old fucking hack joke.  You know what, man?  No, no, no.  Tell me what comedians I've trashed. 
[03:48:30]  Tell me.  Who?  Oh, we're going to, I hate it when you guys do this shit.  You want me to recall something totally specific?  You are fucking saying something, so I'm asking you about it.  You're the one that brought this to the table, not us.  Like, who do we trash that's clean?  Who?  You know what?  I'm going to start keeping notes so that I can recall.  Well, dude, if you're going to call somebody, then fucking, then have you, I'm asking you  who, because I don't trash comedians that aren't from the comedy cellar.  I trash bad comedy.  You, anybody, it seems like anybody who's just a fucking, a guy who's out there pounding 
[03:49:00]  the road doing these shitty clothes.  Really?  Like Larry the Cable Guy, who I fucking defended?  Like Larry the Cable Guy, who's as Midwest as you can get, who I defended and I smashed  all the alternative comics for bashing him?  Like him, stupid?  Yeah, Larry's been on our show.  Brian Regan's been on our show.  Personally, I mean, you know, it's a taste thing.  If you like Craig Shoemaker, so be it.  We think he's a hack, or at least this bit is a hack.  And he's been living off his bit for 12 years.  Okay, I guess, I guess you're, you're right that it might be hack, but it's like, it 
[03:49:30]  seems to me like it's just too over the top, like, holy fuck, you're really, does it really  fucking piss you off?  Yes, yes, yes.  Are you listening to that?  Like, dude, I don't know what Shoemaker's act is like.  I've never met the guy.  But listening to that little bit, I've heard his name on the circuit for years.  And when you say, I'll love you so good, your neighbors will have a smoke.  I don't know.  It just doesn't.  Craig, everybody knows what he's saying, right?  Exactly.  So why not just say it?  Mike, I don't know Craig Shoemaker's act for the most part, but this bit sucks. 
[03:50:00]  And we do call out people for being act.  It's his benchmark bit.  It's his benchmark bit.  He might be a funny guy.  I don't know.  I've never seen him live.  But I mean, I'm listening to this thing, and I can't believe this was voted the best  routine by the XM Nation.  Are you kidding me?  Why wasn't Gallagher voted best routine?  There's a comic.  It's more funny if he says, I'm going to blow my fucking load right in your face.  No, the whole bit.  I don't like the whole bit.  Do you actually laugh when you hear that, Mike?  Mike.  Yeah, you know what, man?  I do. 
[03:50:30]  I'm sorry.  Then you're a dummy, and I hope your family winds up in Paul Bernardo's basement.  You fucker.  Oh, Paul Bernardo.  Wow, you went local for Canada.  I like it.  Going local.  I love it.  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.  Let me say something, please.  You listen to the comedy channels a lot, right?  Yeah, I'm on the road a lot.  So I mean, you listen to the comedy channels a lot.  You're trying to tell me this bit by Craig Shoemaker, the Love Master, is the best routine  you've heard on the comedy channels.  I don't care.  We're not looking for a dirty comic. 
[03:51:00]  I'm just saying the best routine that you've heard on the comedy channels, dirty or clean.  No, no, no.  That's what we're getting at to begin with.  Yeah, you see, no, no.  You're right.  We're being uber-critical, yes, because this was voted the best routine of the fucking  year by the XM Nation.  Well, then, isn't it fucking more important to fucking rag on the XM Nation?  Yeah, okay.  I understand what you're saying.  We're ragging on the bit, dude.  Have you ever heard Louis Black?  Have you heard Louis Black?  I mean, Louis C.K.?  Yeah, Louis Black, he kills me.  Fucking Louis Black kills me.  Louis C.K.? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, Louis C.K.  I love that.  David Tell?  Joe Rogan?  Wait, hold on.  David Tell?  Yes.  Okay, all comedy-seller comics.  All of them.  I know, man.  Believe me, I'm not saying those guys aren't funny.  I think those guys are fucking hilarious.  All right, you made your point, Mike.  Thank you.  But I just thought it was fucking disingenuous to just go way over the top of the-  No, it wasn't at all.  No, no, no, dude.  Not at all.  We're not pushing this one at all.  I very rarely trash comedians by name because I have a certain bond with comics, and I don't  even dislike Shoemaker.  I don't know him.  The bit that I'm hearing right now, I've heard about so many years, and I don't like it 
[03:52:00]  because it's just too purposefully family clean, and it's just bugging me.  Yeah, but don't you think there's a fucking good place for that?  If a guy-  Yeah, in fucking church basements.  Yes.  No, no, no.  If a guy's stuck doing places in smaller venues in smaller regions, I'm not going to-  Dude, he's got a big following.  Craig Shoemaker has a following.  He's not an anonymous comic.  He's not playing dumps all the time.  He has a lot of Peter fans. 
[03:52:30]  But I think he realized at a certain point that he had to fucking mainstream it a little  bit.  But mainstream is fine.  We don't care about mainstream as much as-  Brian Regan is one of the best mainstream ever, and he's hysterical.  This is hack.  We're taking issue to the fact that this was voted the best routine.  It's a hack catchphrase bit-  In the comedy category.  That he made a song out of, and he's using old hack jokes in it.  I know.  All right, Mike.  Yeah, I know, Mike.  All right, all right.  Oh, Canada. 
[03:53:00]  I hung up on him.  Yeah.  I didn't should have.  Enough.  But the guy, there's a guy on here that-  He did say something, though, that I have noticed.  There are times, sometimes we'll be ragging on something, and I'll get home and listen  to the replay, or I'll hear it a few days later, or whenever we replay it, and I'll  listen to myself and go, why the fuck am I so worked up about that?  Like, I'll hear myself going, so, you know, why don't they just stop doing that?  And it's about, like, chewing gum, or something really useless. 
[03:53:30]  I'll be like, boy, I sure was passionate that day about that.  And I don't think we're being that over the top.  We're just yucking the bits.  Yeah, it's just-  Because it was voted the best routine.  Let's not forget that, because there's a few other people saying it's a good bit.  I'll tell them to shut the fuck up.  I'm listening to it.  A lot of people saying it.  They hate it, too.  Scarecrow from Houston says it all.  This fucking bit is filled with jokes.  Updated.  I just know it's a hack bit.  I know what I-  Hold on.  This fucking bit is filled with jokes you get emailed from your great aunt. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, with attachments and-  I know a good bit when I hear it.  People are going, this is a good bit.  I'm listening to this for the first time ever.  Yeah.  And I don't- I'm not enjoying it.  And if people out there enjoy it, then so be it.  I'm not trying to-  Comedy is subjective, but then there's also things that are like, this is-  It's hack.  Comedy is subjective, but it's almost like as a comic, at least I hope I can at least distance myself enough to recognize something that's funny.  Like, again, Mooney's an example I use a lot.  He's a guy I don't agree with at all, but I acknowledge the guy's a great comedy writer. 
[03:54:30]  You can't say he's not a funny joke writer.  He's always topical.  He's all- he's great at what he does.  Not my fucking vibe, but I respect what he does, and I know it's good.  All right, why don't we go to more of the Craig Shoemaker bit?  There's already a little more time in there.  Man, here's some people staring at me right now.  I'm looking for one laugh, by the way.  One laugh.  What the hell happened to him?  Coming out of character there. 
[03:55:00]  What?  Those girls, too.  Of course they are.  All the girls.  They look at me going, where'd the minivan guy go?  No mini right here, baby.  Oh, baby.  That's right.  This ain't no guppy.  I'll free Willie.  That's right, baby.  Yeah.  Okay, stop that right there.  Stop that.  Who the fuck is laughing at I'll free Willie?  I'm laughing at your anger. 
[03:55:30]  Because, dude, I'm annoyed that people are saying this is a great bit.  I know.  When it's all fucking innuendo and puns and fucking little, come on, dude.  Let's continue.  I'm looking for one laugh.  One laugh.  That's right.  This ain't no guppy.  I'll free Willie.  That's right, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'll have you breathing heavier than Ruben started on a Stairmaster.  That's right, baby.  Yeah.  What are you laughing at?  That's me tapping you on the shoulder right now.  Don't turn your head. 
[03:56:00]  You'll get a black eye.  He's got a big cock, Jimmy.  That was so gross.  Oh, my God.  Erase, erase, erase.  Well, you guys got the check.  Suddenly, it's not so funny.  Is it last call?  I'm talking to you, baby.  Oh, God.  Don't you ignore me, baby. 
[03:56:30]  Why?  I'll jog your memory.  You remember me.  You want me to go away?  You want your wish?  You got to rub the lamp.  Go ahead.  Leave the room.  I'll bend it around the corner back there.  His big dick, Jimmy.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Big cock.  I get it.  His big cock.  I'm so sorry.  Erase, erase, erase.  Oh, these women just love the dick. 
[03:57:00]  Keep that big mouth open, baby.  Yeah.  I'll give you the gag order.  That was a horrible visual.  No, it was a horrible audio experience.  Seriously, don't encourage him.  Erase, erase, erase.  See, whenever a comedian, to me, just continually, like, chides himself for his own naughtiness.  Yeah.  Like, when a comedian continually, like, slaps his own hand and goes, I can't believe I just 
[03:57:30]  went there.  Oh, guys, I don't know what's...  Oh, now.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What the fuck is that?  It's awful, is what it is.  I would be interested to hear the rest of his act, because this is his, the bit that  he got known from.  That's his benchmark bit.  So maybe the rest of the act is different.  I don't know.  I can't judge his whole act.  I've never heard it.  Well...  Whatever happened to the guy that used to use the bullhorn all the time?  Remember Mr. Bullhorn?  Glenn Super, he died.  Is he dead?  I think he died of cancer. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, he was in Long Island.  He was a nice guy.  I worked with him once.  Not the reaction I was expecting.  That is.  I'm sorry.  How did he die?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Let's get Craig Shoemaker on the phone.  Okay.  Holy shit.  Is that funny?  I don't care.  I don't even want to trash the guy.  Well, supposedly he admitted it's a dopey bit.  Wait a minute, my hair is falling out.  Oh, no.  What would Mr. Bullhorn do? 
[03:58:30]  Doctor, I have a big tumor.  Can you take it out?  Oh, Mr. Bullhorn.  I'm sorry if you knew him, Jimmy.  I know.  I worked with him once many years ago.  Yeah.  He was a nice dude, man.  I didn't know him, though.  I didn't know him.  Steven from Arizona.  What's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  I feel bad now.  Yes.  Hey, Jim.  Jim, you know, as most comics do, I just want to break down the eighth wall if I can still  Obie's bit, but that bit is riddled with stock lines. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  There's a lot of, again, certain lines, I give a certain amount of leeway to any old  bits because you don't know, like, how stock something was before someone.  Like, if a guy's been doing it a bit 20 years, certain lines may not have been hacked  when he first started doing them.  Harder than Chinese algebra?  No, no, that one, yeah.  That one, yes.  I learned that in third grade, and I'm now 28 years old.  Can I stand up?  You know, I'm still looking like I'm out of college.  Well, the other day, I got proof.  What, sir?  What?  Can I stand up for the show?  Yeah.  They mentioned, the guy was implying that you guys only back comics that are friends 
[03:59:30]  of the show, and, you know, seller comics.  Oh, he was in.  Jimmy just paid a compliment to Lisa fucking Lampanelli.  I mean, he really did pay her a compliment, and he's done it more than one time.  He even paid a compliment.  You guys, all three, have complimented Artie Lang.  And, yeah.  Yeah.  We, I mean, we like dirty, we like clean.  It's not like we just like dirty comics.  That's ridiculous.  Dude, I like a good comedian.  I don't just like dirty or clean. 
[04:00:00]  And comedians recognize normally other, you know, or good comics.  I mean, comics don't badmouth Chappelle, Attell.  Louis Black's a really good stand-up.  I mean, you know, come on, man.  We're in the business.  We understand what's good.  Speaking of Louis Black, stand-up champion of 2006.  Yep.  Louis is on fire this show.  Female was Lisa Lampanelli, best comic of the year, according to the Eximation.  And Louis Black got the male title.  All right.  We should, we should stop right there because there's too much anger in the room.  Yeah.  Everyone's all angry now. 
[04:00:30]  We ended on an angry note.  I like that.  Are you angry?  I'm angry.  I'm trying to take my breather.  I know.  I feel bad for you.  It's really stuck today.  So I got to do it.  I got to, what?  We have to break so we can do line of the day.  I just didn't want to do it.  What?  Was it a good line of the day?  Of course it was.  Yeah.  They're all gems.  Which one was it?  Which one was?  Well, we haven't officially voted, but the contestants were Ant singing the Sting nursery rhyme. 
[04:01:00]  Okay.  Oh.  And Jim, I wrote it down.  I know.  I know which one it was.  I can't remember.  Congratulations to Jim Norton and Anthony for line of the day.  Sponsored by BodogFight.com.  See you tomorrow.  Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big.  Goddamn!  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, said, then you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists.  You present it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is. 
[04:01:30]  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags.  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  But you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance, none on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  None on us.  We're in and age.  Skied.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
