<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show opened with a discussion of "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" ("WOW"), a listener-driven segment encouraging the display of "WOW" signs on vehicles to attract women.  The hosts detailed various methods of WOW sign creation, including bumper stickers available on their website (opianthony.com).  This segued into a recap of a previous, infamous segment featuring "Stalker Patty," a woman offered $2,000 by listeners to help with her eviction.  The recounting involved audio clips of the resulting stunt: a naked Patty crawling across the studio floor while the hosts repeatedly sprung mousetraps around her.  The audio was compared to footage from Abu Ghraib prison.

The show then introduced a new game: if a joke bombed, the teller had to put their finger in a mousetrap.  Numerous hosts and callers participated, resulting in varying degrees of injury and comedic reactions.  Elo, another show personality, was present in the studio and also participated in the mousetrap challenge. A caller incorrectly identified the Enola Gay as a boat, not a plane.  Listener calls continued throughout, contributing to the mousetrap-related shenanigans and sharing humorous personal anecdotes.  The mousetrap segment, and the Stalker Patty incident, remained recurring themes throughout the broadcast.

The show continued with a running gag centered around the mousetraps, and a discussion of a listener-generated Photoshop thread on their website featuring humorous images based on show content.  Elo, identified as the CEO of Sirius XM, was a guest in the studio during this part, discussing new portable satellite radio units and their upcoming release in Canada. Anthony offered a scathing review of *Brokeback Mountain*, which he found incredibly boring, despite its critical success, detailing plot points and making humorous commentary on the gay cowboy theme.  The death of actor Chris Penn was briefly mentioned, and a video of his body being loaded into a truck was referenced humorously.  Further discussion covered a high school student protesting the school's dress code by wearing a skirt, the upcoming Super Bowl, and the hosts' preferred sports teams.

A caller named Bruce recounted his dismissal from a job for wearing shorts, sparking a debate about workplace dress codes, fairness, and the disparity between childhood dreams and adult realities.  This discussion included anecdotes about youth sports where everyone receives a trophy, contrasting with the competitive ruthlessness of professional sports.  The hosts shared their own unmet childhood aspirations (NBA player, F-16 pilot, radio announcer) and recounted instances of unexpected jealousy from others regarding their current success.  Listeners called in with similar experiences of disillusionment and discussed the competitiveness versus equality debate in youth sports, sharing stories of unusual rules designed to stifle standout players. The segment ended with a parody song mocking David Lee Roth's struggling radio show and speculating on his potential firing.

The final segment consisted of a vitriolic attack on Bubba the Love Sponge, accusing him of hypocrisy for working for Howard Stern after previously criticizing him.  The hosts employed highly offensive and sexually graphic language to describe their perception of Bubbaâ€™s subservience to Stern. They contrasted Bubba's career with their own, highlighting their media appearances (including the *New York Post*, *60 Minutes*, Larry King, Bill O'Reilly, and David Letterman), suggesting Bubba's success solely depended on his association with Stern.  The segment ended with a defiant challenge to Bubba regarding his long-term career prospects.

The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you people?  What are you people?  I'm dope?  You're a foley.  Hey, this guy's a great big foley.  Hey, you're a great big foley. 
[00:05:00]  You know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat foley.  Hey, bud.  What's your problem?  You would do it.  I hate this.  Well...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
[00:05:30]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, ow, ow.  Oh, no, not really. 
[00:06:30]  We could do that all day.  Those are all new ringtones that are available, I think.  Yeah.  Wouldn't this be a good ringtone?  Sounds like a phone.  Who's calling? 
[00:07:00]  We should just throw that up on the website so that people can download it and make you the ringtone for free.  What the fuck?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Hi.  We should describe wow for all the newbies out there.  Newbies?  Don't know about wow?  It's easy.  It's so easy.  The old faithful can recite it along with me.  Yes, the old gag.  Same dribble every week. 
[00:07:30]  Give it to them again.  No, I don't want to.  And I sit here.  I'm like, all right, I got to describe wow every Wednesday.  Yeah.  And I try to describe it differently.  But I know the listeners, the ones that listen all the time are just reciting along with me.  They go, all right, we know, we get it.  It is really a very, very cool thing.  Yeah.  Basically, there's sluts out there.  Oh, geez, that's going to cut down on the wow factor.  And they want to show you their fun bags. 
[00:08:00]  Their breast-ices.  But then how do they know?  How do they know that there's a guy that is willing to accept the loveliness of their breasts while they're driving?  Right.  By seeing the wow, the W-O-W, somewhere on their vehicle.  Which means whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  So, like what, it's like a bumper sticker or something?  It could be in the form of one of our officially sanctioned bumper stickers, indeed.  You can go to opanthony.com to get the official wow bumper sticker. 
[00:08:30]  So, wait a minute.  So, like, you put it on, like, the bumper of your, like, car?  Right.  What if you put it in your window?  Works just as well.  The greater the visibility, the greater the chance.  Unless your window is tinted, then it doesn't work too well now, does it?  Does it?  Or, as many truckers have done, does it, Bill?  I was pissed I forgot about that.  That ended me fucking laughing for the rest of the day.  I was doing it to people who didn't even listen to the show.  You know what sucks?  I can't do it unless you're in the studio. 
[00:09:00]  I tried it when you weren't here.  It doesn't work the same way.  You've done it a few times, though.  Yeah, I guess.  All right.  So, then you got the wow bumper sticker.  Yeah.  You can go to opanthony.com to get the official wow bumper sticker.  Or anything.  I remember a time where people, maybe their company, said that they couldn't put a wow  sticker on their vehicle.  Right.  Remember that?  Mm-hmm.  And guys would just get very creative.  Remember when those wow chips came out?  People were putting that on their little deck lid. 
[00:09:30]  And then people were accusing us of making money off of wow chips.  We're always being accused of making these side deals.  Well, you're making money off of this little private room, aren't you?  Oh, Pal Talk?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been accused of just pocketing money on Pal Talk.  I heard that's the money you use to take out your little horse ship every weekend.  Oh, horse ship.  You obsessive freak.  Oh, God, it's Wednesday and not Monday.  Oh, she's not there?  No.  Getting back to the...  She's all fucked out.  Talk all you want now.  It's Wednesday.  Getting back to the...  You know what? 
[00:10:00]  I'm not buying this bluff.  This is like some Texas...  Texas holes of shit.  I got a shitty hand.  Yeah.  You're calling me?  I'm all in.  So they were putting wow chips on the back window.  Yeah.  Just any wow.  And then they were blaming us for leaky asses.  Yes.  Some leakage and soft stools.  It was two different wow things that were going on.  And then you can make your homemade wow sign.  That's good, too.  And then the women, they see the wow on the trucks and the cars, and some of these women 
[00:10:30]  will flash you.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you're driving, you don't know why.  Wow chips.  Do they still make those?  I don't know.  With the anal...  Yeah, it was like anal leakage and soft stools would give you.  Mmm.  These better be tasty.  These better be worth it.  You ever have something and you know it's just going to fuck you up, but it's so  damn delicious.  Oh, yeah.  I can't eat enough of that raisin bran, Opie.  Oof.  But wow.  I had to give up on the raisin bran.  It's like the Bombay door of the Enola Gay when I'm trying to take a seat. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, which is the sign.  People never understand that that's what that is.  That means your body is like, whatever this is, we need to get this out.  Get it out.  Immediately.  But it's so damn tasty.  Same thing with like grapes.  Yeah, grapes do it for me.  I can't eat...  Who takes...  You buy the big bundle, whatever they're called, of grapes, and it's in a huge bowl.  Can't just have one.  Who's going to take a little twig or one or two?  The whole thing has to be eaten in one sitting. 
[00:11:30]  Just...  And not even one grape at a time.  Buy the handful.  Yeah.  So grape juice is shooting out your nose.  Hanging out your mouth.  Slowly but surely you start hearing your stomach.  A squeaky hinge gut.  Yeah.  Grapes I buy every week and I never eat them.  Those and like cantaloupe.  They just go bad.  Cantaloupe just sits there and then you just see one side like compressing like some baby's head. 
[00:12:00]  The soft side of it.  Don't touch the soft spot.  Yeah, like, ah, yeah.  I think I'll throw that out.  Big thud in the bottom of it.  That was your attempt to be healthy and eat right and get your servings of fruit in.  Yeah.  Looks good on your counter, but you're not eating it.  Yeah, I had a big New Year's resolution.  I was like, that's it, man.  More fruits and vegetables.  Ripped in 06.  It was doing crunches.  Yeah.  That lasted a couple weeks and I got sick in San Francisco. 
[00:12:30]  I'm still hanging in there trying to eat well.  Getting sick is the one thing that really fucks you up when you're trying to do something like workout or anything.  The second you get sick, it's like, please.  And then you go back.  What are you going back to the gym?  Oh, I feel a little better.  Let me go to the gym.  No, and then you get sick.  You're just like, well, I'm just going to eat whatever I want just to make me feel better.  And once you have, let's say, crack, the second you eat like burgers and fries, you're done.  You're back on the plate.  I'm done until March.  You're right.  You're right.  I was just getting everything in sight when I was sick.  I got to stay in shape. 
[00:13:00]  No one wants to see a fat redhead.  I've realized that.  You're the lead.  You are so far from fat.  Huh?  You are so far from fat, though.  But, dude, you got to have a fucking high standard.  Oh, is that what you were doing?  That's what you have to do.  Because you know what happens?  If you wait until you're 20 pounds of weight, you're finished.  You're done.  It's very hard to get rid of.  Well, I mean, you can do it, but it's just like...  Then it's work.  Yes.  It's not just maintaining something.  Yeah.  Hey, I got to interrupt you because you're not going to believe this phone call.  Rob in Pennsylvania.  Rob?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, sir.  What's up, Rob? 
[00:13:30]  I need to correct Mr. Professor Anthony there.  All right.  Talking about the chips and the Bombay doors of the Enola Gay.  The Enola Gay is a boat, you idiot.  The Enola Gay is a boat.  All right, sir, please, whatever you do, don't hang up.  I want you to explain that.  What is the Enola Gay as far as a boat?  When was it built?  Where is it?  Give me a little history on the Enola Gay, the boat.  Not the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima with Colonel Tibbetts at the helm. 
[00:14:00]  Who, where does the Enola Gay, the boat, come in?  Sir?  Thank you.  Thank you.  And you know what?  It's a boat.  And that reminds us of something that Bill Burr wants to bring to this fine radio show.  Bill Burr is going to have a legacy.  The mousetrap thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I think the people at home should play along, too.  That guy should have then played. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  Yeah, I had a little guilt, especially after seeing the video footage.  Well, the mousetrap video is up on opianthony.com.  Of the hostage we basically had.  It did look like Al-Qaeda hostage footage.  And I have an ear-to-ear grin like I'm in a breakfast cereal commercial.  Well, these honeycoes are delicious.  So I was saying, I was thinking last night, laying in bed, just feeling guilty about that,  because I tried to explain it to somebody last night at a comedy club, and the horror on their face.  Yeah, it's hard to explain. 
[00:15:00]  And she was naked, and she was going to get evicted.  So we put the check down, and we had mice trapped.  And they were slapping on it, and he was just looking at me.  They did that?  They did that on the radio?  That's horrible.  But I'm like, you know, why didn't you speak up?  And I'm just, oh, you know, I'm at the Stress Factory this weekend.  I had to hype the gig, you know.  You know what's weird about this show?  Like, that seemed completely normal within the confines of this fine studio. 
[00:15:30]  Then you walk out to a beautiful, you know, warm day.  It felt like early spring yesterday.  The sun's out.  And you start looking at people going, you know what?  These people would never understand what just happened in that studio.  I always get a kind of awful, sick feeling the second the blinds start coming down.  Kind of like when someone's like, Bobby Kelly's the king of showing me, like, horrific shit on the Internet.  I used to live with him, and he would just bring shit up.  And, like, he'd just go, duh, duh. 
[00:16:00]  As I'm watching TV, and I would look over, it would be like some 80-year-old woman with her legs spread.  And you just get that feeling in the middle of your chest, like, I just shouldn't have seen that shit.  Same feeling the second these things start coming down.  The shades come down.  It's like, oh, here it goes.  It's going to get some action.  The gas is going to start pouring in any second now.  I can explain to the new listeners we have to cover up all the windows when we do our crazy shit.  Yeah, and we actually have real shades.  We work in an office with all guys, but there's guys out there that are offended by some of this.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  But we do your little experiments.  Yeah.  They are.  Little experiments.  You were truly evil yesterday, and a few people picked up on the fact that...  It was a lot of fun.  It wasn't enough yet.  It wasn't enough just to leave them on the floor.  He had to keep pushing them in the way.  Yeah, she was blindfolded, so she couldn't see.  So Opie is pushing the mousetraps in front of her, and then when one went off or snapped  on her, he would instantly reload it and put it back in line.  So it was a never-ending supply of mousetraps in her path. 
[00:17:00]  Don't ever question it.  I know how to do good radio.  You're the sickest bastard on the radio.  I was trying to get her toes, and I was trying to get body parts.  My hands!  And she's screaming that horrific Patty scream.  Can we get some highlights from the mousetraps thing?  It sounded like a chimp being beaten.  Like, that's how her scream is.  You know, there's a lot of people listening.  She sounded like a big mouse, basically.  A lot of people listening right now, they didn't even hear the bits, so we're going to get some 
[00:17:30]  highlights for later on this morning, because it was great.  She needed $2,000.  She was being evicted.  The listeners are the good guys.  They took it upon themselves to collect $2,000 for Stalker Patty.  Most of them don't know her from a hole in the wall.  And all she was supposed to do was come in and get the fine checks from the listeners.  That's all it's supposed to be.  It's supposed to be a throwaway thing, like, here, Patty, we know you're on hard times.  Here's $2,000.  Yeah, and you should...  That video's going to come back to haunt me. 
[00:18:00]  If I ever get any sort of respectable gig in this business.  What do you think?  Where do you think you're going?  Politics?  No, but I figure I can get some shitty part in a sitcom.  Everyone that has a shitty part in a sitcom has a skeleton.  Worse than watching some nude woman crawl on a phone.  Like that?  All right, maybe not like that.  Sitting there with glee on your face.  Clearly etched across your face on video.  She's 50 years old, naked.  Can't you get...  That looks like those Iraqi, like, prisoner videos.  Yeah.  Well, we were joking about that in the back office.  We're like, imagine CNN, this just in. 
[00:18:30]  We have another video coming out of Iraq.  Yeah, Abu Ghraib prison.  Right.  You should have stacked her on top of Big A.  Yeah.  Put her on a leash and point at her with a cigarette in your mouth.  Give her the thumbs up.  That's right.  And I was the person smiling in the video.  Yeah.  Smiling.  I'm going to get court-martialed.  You are Lindy England.  That video is great.  It's up on opianthony.com.  I think it's going to be downloaded a lot.  Oh, yeah.  That's going to be a fave.  So, anyway, so as awful as that was, I was thinking how funny it was when we were slamming 
[00:19:00]  our fingers in those things.  So, I was thinking maybe for a day, you know, in the vein of, like, extreme sports, instead  of having the car crash when you joke bombs, you've got to put your finger in one of those  mice trap.  That's what we want to do today.  This could ruin comic timing.  Like, sometimes you've just got to blurt stuff out, and the quicker it comes out, the funnier  it is.  Oh, yeah.  But now if you're thinking, hmm, is this worthy, or am I going to be mousetrapped on the paw, 
[00:19:30]  you might ruin your timing.  Well, we have something to fix that loophole.  Can you point that banana at me, sir?  I said, he's pointing a banana at me.  I'm getting all into it, huh?  Let me tell you something.  Hey, young fella.  We've got to get Stalker Patty on the phone to see how our hands are, too.  Yeah, I know I'm aching.  I tried it out yesterday.  We all gave it a whirl.  Well, they got the bad traps, too.  They got these uber traps.  You're used to the Victor mouse traps. 
[00:20:00]  The cute ones.  The cute ones.  The ones that, you know, they slam down for a mouse, it's one thing.  You catch them by the tail, you let it go.  Ah, you let them go.  But these are just killer mousetraps with some really tight springs.  I am not going to put my finger in this today.  Oh, it's too early for this.  Oh, you pull it back a quarter of the way, and already you've got enough tension for some severe pain.  Oh, yeah.  The whole way?  Oh.  It's a crocodile.  Yeah.  It's like a teenage crocodile. 
[00:20:30]  What are they?  2,000 pounds per square inch.  All the pressure.  You know, you can hold his mouth shut because all the muscle power is meant for closing those mighty jaws.  Someone wanted to know if Patty goes home and gets in the fetal position after doing our show.  She's clueless to what this is supposed to do to you psychologically.  Yeah.  She's clueless.  She's enjoying the money right now.  All right.  It's set.  Mindset.  Mine's busted. 
[00:21:00]  It is not.  It is.  Well, first of all, I don't know how to do it.  You don't know how to set a mousetrap?  Isn't it supposed to have, like, a hook right there?  No, give me that.  It's got a little thing.  If it was a hook, it wouldn't go off.  Yeah.  It's supposed to precariously, like, very frighteningly perch on that.  On what?  In that.  I might say, I'm like a retard trying to load a gun here.  I'm not saying.  See this?  Hey, do it for me.  This is loaded.  See where that piece is?  There you go.  Load your mousetrap.  That little notch goes in the slit, and it barely holds on. 
[00:21:30]  Just waiting for the little mouse to try to get the cheese.  So what are we going to do today?  Oh, you're going to hurt yourself just loading this.  I know.  You're going to see why I flunked the fucking woodclash.  All right, get that in there.  And VCR saying, I can't fucking do this.  Hey, give it to me.  You've got to load it.  I'll load it for you.  You're afraid to load it.  So what's the deal, Bill?  If we bomb today, if a joke goes bad?  Car crash.  No, you've got to stick your finger in there. 
[00:22:00]  So instead of the car crash, when a joke bombs, the finger's got to go into the...  Yeah, go ahead.  Just grab it by the sides.  There you go.  Grab it by the sides.  There you go.  Don't cut the green wire.  Yeah, grab it by the edges.  Be careful.  You fucking motherfucker.  There you go.  Oh.  Now, place it down very carefully.  There we go.  We all have our mousetraps in front of us, loaded, ready to go for a bomb. 
[00:22:30]  Extreme comedy.  This is going to be shown on ESPN2.  But Bill also wants to call out people that aren't taking chances on the show, because  you could sit back and just have a...  Like, ooh, I better not say it.  ...a very casual show.  You need some attempts here.  No garbage time.  All right.  Now I'm just going to sit on the bench.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's see how it is.  You know what else is great?  If I get nailed too many times, I'm going to stop laughing at your shit.  Hey, come on.  This is going to be good.  Scott in Utah, what's up?  Hey, you know what's really bad? 
[00:23:00]  And I don't know.  Maybe I'm just wrong.  But why is it every time when Patty leaves the studio, I picture her going home and curling  up in the fetal position?  Yeah.  She's not affected.  I'm telling you.  Didn't someone say that?  I'm telling you.  No.  She, no.  No.  I did, because it sounds vaguely familiar.  I did, because he was on the line and then for some reason went away.  And now he's calling back after I said what he was going to say.  Which means he didn't have to call back, but he did.  This is how we were.  Now we're stuck with commenting on what Scott is saying right now.  This is the loophole. 
[00:23:30]  This is the loophole.  No, it's all right, Scott.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Just give it another try there, Bill.  It's like fifth attempt to jump in.  That's the loophole.  Like if we ever have to go to court over that one, you know, the whole she was asking for  it.  Right.  Was when he was talking about the check.  She goes, do I have to stick it in my hoo-ha-ha?  So right there.  Asking for it.  Right.  Asking for it.  We have the audio right now.  Why don't we play it?  It's only a couple minutes. 
[00:24:00]  Here's Stalker Patty yesterday, completely naked, crawling around the floor of the studio,  trying to find two $1,000 checks that the listeners collected.  So she can make her rent.  Yeah.  So she doesn't get evicted.  Among 10 mousetraps that turned into the equivalent of about 30, because we kept reloading them.  Don't say we.  You did.  We.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You were really enjoying yourself.  It was a lot of fun.  Here it is.  Get her on all fours.  All right, here's the deal. 
[00:24:30]  You hear my voice?  Shit.  That's a great start.  It just starts awful, doesn't it?  Get her on all fours.  You know it sounded like that at the Abu Ghraib prison.  You know it started like that.  Just get them on all fours, man.  Get the leash, dude.  I got a leash back there.  All right, Lindy, thumbs up.  The best part that's going to make me laugh all day is our sick experiments at Bill Burms.  You point out something great.  We do some crazy experiments in here. 
[00:25:00]  It's not.  It's curtains.  They go down.  You think we're doing radio.  I guess people are listening in on this stuff, but it's actually us just doing experiments.  Dude, I swear to God, if that thing comes down, it's like that movie where they're cutting people's toes off.  What is that fucking commercial?  Hostel.  What's it called?  Oh, Hostel.  Hostel.  Yeah, I got to see that.  Yeah, it does seem like that.  Is that the sound effect of a drill?  Yeah.  Never come in here when I'm doing my experiments. 
[00:25:30]  I thought I was getting a mousetrap there.  I'm like, it's like that movie on the thing.  Weren't you?  I was kind of thinking, I think Bill's hand is going to go on the mousetrap.  My hands are under my armpits right now.  Scared.  No kidding.  All right, let's go.  Here's Sucker Patty.  That's such a stupid idea.  Get her on all fours.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Patty, here's the deal.  You hear my voice?  Shit.  I do.  All right.  You've got to come toward me.  There's ten mousetraps in front of you.  I don't know where you are. 
[00:26:00]  And she allowed to curl her fingers up like that.  And two...  Yeah, she could do whatever she wants.  But you've got to feel around for the checks as you move forward, okay?  Oh, I'm so scared.  Yes, but just think of the wonderful prizes.  You're going to win at the end of this.  $2,000, Patty.  Oh, no.  No, don't do that!  $2,000, Patty.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't.  Okay, that was...  Don't move.  That was not the check.  Oh, this is a shame.  Oh, yes, we got it.  It's...  Oh, my God.  Feel around for the check, Patty.  You're almost there.  $2,000 on the...  Oh, my God.  That hit me.  That hit me.  My finger. 
[00:27:00]  That's what it's supposed to do.  Hey, if you were a mouse, you'd be dead.  Come on.  Keep crawling.  Come on, old mouse, huh?  Do you think mice get $2,000 at the end of this thing?  No.  By the way, if you don't buy the checks by the end of the show, then they stay on the  floor until tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  That was the back of the head.  Oh, my God.  It's just got the palm of my hand.  She's going to have to give the teller the check with her mouth.  You're mean.  You're mean. 
[00:27:30]  Patty, we're running out of show.  Come on, Patty.  Run out of show.  All your problems could go away.  I built a piece of paper.  Do I have a check?  I think I do.  You just got $1,000.  Yeah, there it is.  One check.  One check.  One to go.  One to go.  $1,000.  Oh!  Ow!  It's my palm, my knuckles.  I think it's my palm, my knuckles. 
[00:28:00]  Fuck, man.  I can't even think of it.  There you go.  That's half of the bit.  Someone's pointing out we just played this like 30 minutes ago, I guess, before we started  the live show today.  Sorry about that.  But we're hearing it again for the first time.  Oh, really?  That was on the replay?  Well, I mean, I guess yesterday's show replays right up until 7 o'clock.  So, I guess timing-wise, this place is in a half hour.  Hey, we wanted to hear it.  That's right.  Go screw.  And then we're adding to it and commenting and what have you. 
[00:28:30]  That's what we're doing.  We've got to say hi to Elo before he takes off for a huge meeting.  Elo.  Elo's been sitting in.  Yeah, you better.  I'm staying as far away as that mousetrap as I can.  I ain't saying nothing.  You're not going to.  You better be funny.  I ain't saying nothing.  Yeah, you better be funny, motherfucker.  You ought to take the mousetrap idea to the meetings.  If people don't come up with a creative idea that helps the company, wham, they've got to  stick their hand in a mousetrap.  Or just go right to the guillotines.  Either one.  It's fine.  Why don't you just take one for the team so you can be one of the boys?  Take one for the team.  Come on, man.  After listening to Patty turn into a chimpanzee on the radio? 
[00:29:00]  Just be one of the boys.  Come on, man.  One of the boys.  Ain't going to happen, Cap.  That's insane.  Just the meaty part of your hand right below the pinky.  That's insane.  That's insane.  You don't even have a finger.  No, there's no way.  Come on, now.  Doesn't even...  Oh!  You did it!  Wait, I think that trap stinks.  No, that hurt.  Yeah, that hurt.  All right, Elo.  You just can't think about it.  You just got to do it.  Ow!  It does hurt like a son of a bitch. 
[00:29:30]  God.  Can you imagine being like...  Oh, no.  On your neck?  Right on your neck.  I saw your head working there.  He wanted to psych himself up.  You got to just do it.  He just said, all right, I'll just do it.  That's how Elo works, though.  That right there is his personality.  Right.  Bam.  Bah, bah, bah.  You're doing a great job.  We love you.  You're fired!  That's Elo.  Son of a bitch, that really hurt.  Now, the fun part's going to be watching Bill try to reset the trap, but he's got a wound  of his finger doing this.  You should have to put your hand in it just for the fact that you can't set a mousetrap. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  I can't help.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  No, it goes under the thing.  What goes under the thing?  Lift that up.  Lift the spring thing.  First of all, you don't even know what the fuck this stuff's called.  It goes under the thing.  Oh, yeah.  I know every technical part.  Well, stop acting like you designed it.  Okay.  Lift the aperture and the armature up.  What's this?  That's actually where I'm heading here in a few minutes.  Oh, where?  Where?  Where?  Look, I have one of those.  That's the Good Morning America radio on take five right there.  Oh.  This is a new... 
[00:30:30]  We're only getting it out of one channel today.  This is a new phenomenon in radio.  XM satellite radio.  Look at mine.  And Good Morning America is part of it.  That's right.  Not only can you watch Good Morning America on your television, but you can get in your car  and drive to work and listen to it on satellite radio.  Hillary Barsky, every morning from 8 to noon, is repackaging, reformatting things that  we do here on Good Morning America and expanding them with other car spots.  It's kind of neat.  The studio is just right off of our television studio, and we drop by there every once in 
[00:31:00]  a while just to see how they're doing and make sure that they're featuring my segments,  downplaying their segments, featuring my segments.  Right.  You and your campaign with Hillary.  Hi, Hillary.  And hello to everybody out there on Drive Time and Post Drive Time Radio.  It's great to be on board.  I'll hear some of what you'll hear this morning or see this morning.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  There you go.  So it started up.  Yeah, it started actually Monday, and then we're doing a big press thing at about 9.  Anthony, he can't set it either.  Look at him.  No, no.  The thingy was backwards. 
[00:31:30]  Now it's forward.  The thingy?  The thingy was backwards.  The thingy was backwards.  So Bill, stick your finger in there.  I mean, I did it.  Now it's fixed.  Just do it.  Oh.  Oh.  It almost fit me.  This is like the end of a Mel Gibson movie.  It almost fit me.  All right.  We're set?  No.  Why not?  Oh.  Okay.  That's a fingernail.  Set your own goddamn trap.  Here, I'll do it.  Throw it to me. 
[00:32:00]  No.  Yep.  Oh, I wish it was loaded.  Oh, that's what we've got to do at the end.  Just throw.  Catching mice.  Just throw someone a mousetrap.  I had to set these all.  Oh, that would be a step.  All week long.  Just go to an intern and throw one to him.  He'll catch it.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  What is wrong with this one?  Yeah, that one's busted.  Bill's is busted.  Yeah, get another one for Bill.  He's not getting it.  But I'm not sticking my hand in the other one.  No.  Because it worked just fine.  Elo broke it.  Oh, Elo.  Yeah, he smashed it.  Elo broke it.  Wait, this is.  Hands of steel.  This is busted.  He stuck your forearm in there. 
[00:32:30]  He didn't have to do it with your finger.  Stuck my ass in it.  So you're going over there now.  Yeah, heading down there.  Going to go see Charlie and Robin and set them straight on a few things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Set them straight.  They didn't plug us right the right way.  No, no.  Any Diane to be dropping the XM.  That's what you've got to do.  You've got to get them straightened out.  Yeah.  This one's busted.  That's good.  Damn it.  It goes right in there?  Yeah, it kind of just precariously perched.  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Kentucky.  Jeff, what's up?  Word of the day.  Precariously.  How are you doing? 
[00:33:00]  What's up?  Mr. Logan.  Oh, boy.  I just wanted to thank you and the XM executives for standing behind O&A and giving some of  the best entertaining radio I've ever heard.  Wow.  Look at that.  Well, Jeff, thank you.  You're welcome.  It is the best for you.  All right.  Yep, we agree.  Let's say hi to Mitch in Canada.  Actually, Montreal.  Mitch, what's up?  This is my uncle, by the way.  Hi, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Mitch.  How's the...  Never mind. 
[00:33:30]  Mousetrap.  I like to go on a record that says, if you guys don't get fired for this, now you can  do any fucking thing.  You can have horses in there, fucking women.  You can do anything.  Well, why would we get fired having Stucker Patty, you know, crawling around in mousetraps?  Oh, my God.  That's the most horrendous thing.  You can do a 50-year-old cunt on the floor because she needs money, and you guys are hazing  her.  That's the worst thing you guys have done yet.  It rocks, and there's no way.  You can do any fucking thing.  All right.  Thank you, Mitch.  Thank you, guys. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  Let's go to Chris in Canada.  Wacky Canadians.  Yes.  Chris, what's up?  We certainly are.  Hey, how are you doing?  Hey.  Good.  The sort of word of the day could be vaginal blood fart.  Ugh.  Ugh.  No.  Why would we want that as the word of the day?  Sir, you want a phrase, first of all.  Do you want a mousetrap?  Yeah, sure.  Set it and put your tongue in it.  Yeah, we want you guys to play along at home.  Go fill up the tub.  Everyone go and get their mousetraps.  Find a toaster.  If you call this show, we want you to have a mousetrap handy.  You bomb, you have to do what we're doing. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Let's go to Pete in Virginia.  Pete.  Hey, I was just wondering that Stocker Patty's voice there, her screaming almost sounds like  she's losing her virginity or something on that.  Oh, no.  Car crash.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Watching out.  Damn.  He needs one of those big rat traps.  Things that take an arm off.  Hey, what website is this video on?  It's from a fan.  They just sent it in.  Oh, all right. 
[00:35:00]  They're actually getting some of the video from the PalTalk camera.  The webcam.  Oh, right.  Yeah, there's Patty dancing in front of us on the console.  I did it.  Getting completely naked.  Oh, you loaded it.  I did it.  I did it.  I'm so proud of you, Bill Burr.  Now we can finally move on with the show.  That's great.  Very good, Billy.  Very good.  I did it myself, too.  Yes, you did.  I did it all by myself.  Yes, you did.  You're a big boy.  You're a big man. 
[00:35:30]  Let's go to Corinne.  Corinne, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to ask little Hitler if his next plan was to inject dye into Patty's  eyes to see if they change color.  They could be bluer.  That's not a bad idea.  I think.  Injecting dye in, sure.  We're always looking for new experiments.  That could help.  I think the grand finale with Patty, when she's finally all washed up, is going to result  in a prize, Patty's skin lampshade.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:36:00]  7.23 in the morning.  So what else is going on, Eli?  The visual of dried hide over a lampshade.  Yes.  Nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with that, is it?  What, uh, any talk, new news?  You just pulled the thing down?  What are you, tired?  You fucking...  It hurts!  Shut up, bitch! 
[00:36:30]  I just stared at him.  I just stared at him.  He knew he had to mousetrap himself.  See?  It hurts.  The lampshade bit had run its course.  You decided to take a little dip?  That's why I shut up.  I brought up the lampshade.  Uh-oh.  I'm going to be quiet.  One thing.  Talking lampshade didn't wash.  You better reset that thing.  I don't think Opie's tried a joke in a few minutes.  That's what I'm not saying.  I'm going to pick my spot today.  You know what's odd? 
[00:37:00]  Halfway through...  Yeah, you're not playing that fucking point guard shit today, Opie.  Halfway through what you're saying, you're thinking, uh-oh, is this going to be mousetrap?  And it ruins everything.  It ruins your confidence in the joke.  No, you know what killed it?  It was halfway through the glee on your face.  I was looking like...  He's going to stick it.  You're going to put your hand in there.  This is going to bomb.  Look at him.  We interrupted...  What?  Nidget sighting of the day. 
[00:37:30]  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  Let's go to Puggle Kicker in Dallas.  Puggle Kicker.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, got a fidget sighting for you.  Want to hear you?  Sure, Max.  All right.  Yeah, I pulled up to the truck stop to get fuel earlier.  And, you know, some of these guys convert those Honda Goldwings into, like, a trike, three-wheel.  Yeah.  This big, fat woman, it looked like she had a little kid riding in the front, you know,  like, near the gas tank underneath or whatever, like some people do. 
[00:38:00]  This little midget guy got off of it, and he had, like, four-by-four blocks for the pedals  so he could reach the pedals.  And he had, like, a little jean jacket with the seats cut off of it.  And his helmet was fucking huge.  Of course it was.  The heck is this body, man?  It was funnier shit.  That was the only full-size piece of clothing he had.  Oh, thank God that was funny.  Very good, Bill.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  I got one for you. 
[00:38:30]  Most of the callers are funny, wouldn't you say?  For the most part, right?  Yeah.  So I say today, if they bomb because they don't have mice trapped, Opie's got to take it.  Wow.  No, they're going to bomb on purpose.  They hate me.  Yeah.  But we can sift through it.  We'll be the judge of whether it was true or not.  Oof.  Oof.  Wow.  Wow, that is really taking a chance.  That's like saying if they're rude on instant feedback, they're not funny.  You get it.  Yeah, yeah, then I get it.  If they're trying to bomb, though, you guys got to be fair.  Okay.  If they're, you know, on purpose trying to mess me up. 
[00:39:00]  Let's go to Terry and Jerry's.  I'm not taking any more questions.  That's what I do now.  I believe that's a lack of an attempt.  Yes, that is.  That's a lack of attempt.  Terry in New Jersey, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Fantastic, Terry.  Hit us with a good one.  I think Bill should get a mousetrap because he keeps saying mice trap.  Yeah, why are you saying mice trap?  Fuck.  Sucker. 
[00:39:30]  Let's go to Joe in New Jersey.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, Bill Burr is a bag of douche because of this mousetrap thing, because now I've got to  hear Anthony say finger.  Oh, God damn.  I'm trying to say finger like everyone else says it.  Oh, you don't say it correctly?  No.  Well, I said mice trap instead of mousetrap.  All right, let's go to Ryan in North Carolina.  That's right.  Do it.  Oh, he's got skin stuck.  Oh, I was actually stuck in the trap for a bit. 
[00:40:00]  Let's go to Ryan in North Carolina.  Ryan?  Boy, that does grip.  Every time that the listeners call him with a shitty call, the interns have to mousetrap  themselves for letting it get through.  Yeah, that's what I do now.  If someone is trying to bomb on purpose, then it's going to be Travis that takes it.  But not screening the call correctly.  Yeah, because they have to get through Travis first before they get anywhere near the show.  But then we get to pick which body orifice it goes into.  Toes, fingers, nose.  Yeah, let me show it up there.  Let's see how to build Minnesota. 
[00:40:30]  You lost some skin on that one.  That grabbed a knuckle, too.  You did.  Damn.  Bill?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Bill.  Hey, listen.  I wanted to thank Elo, man.  I got XM day one.  It was available.  I am an insurance rep out on the road.  I listen nonstop to 202.  I paid for the service.  I bet you've got some great insurance rep stories.  Why don't you tell us a few?  Opie, get your hand ready.  Yes.  You know, one time I was checking out this viewing, and it was dented in a way I had never 
[00:41:00]  seen before.  Yeah, he's just thanking Elo for the service.  That's all he was doing.  All right.  Hang up, Bill.  Hang up.  No, don't say anything else.  He didn't mention he was an insurance rep.  Tell us your favorite party joke.  You know, insurance reps are known for their sense of humor.  Salesmen are always funny.  Come on, man.  Always.  Views on the replays coming home later tonight.  That's the part that sucks.  Opie.  Uh-oh.  Opie.  Wait, I don't know what he was saying, though.  Neither does anyone else. 
[00:41:30]  That's why it sucks.  What were you trying to say, Bill?  I just got wowed, guys.  I just wanted to thank you.  You didn't just get wowed.  Damn it.  Got wowed.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  How did your trap not go off?  Uh-oh.  He hit the trap so hard.  He hit the thingy.  Hold on.  I might have busted my trap.  He hit the wire.  Bill, give him your trap.  Oh, yeah.  I've learned how to set these things pretty good.  Yeah, you're pretty good.  Isn't it a catch?  Isn't it nerve-wracking to see?  Oh, yeah.  You've got to let go.  We're bringing more traps in.  You've got to let go, and if it goes off, it just scares the bejesus out of you. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  See you.  You didn't do it.  I did it.  It didn't go on.  No.  Oh, you're because misfires don't count.  You're hitting the thingy.  The what-y?  The metal wire.  Oh!  Oh, wow.  Okay.  That really hurt him.  Oh, wow.  That was just a tip.  That was just a tip.  That could have gotten a nail.  Oh, man.  That could have gotten a nail.  Oh, man.  All right.  He's in real pain.  He's in real pain.  Black fuck down.  He is in real pain. 
[00:42:30]  Look at that.  That is a face of pain.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that got him right on the...  Because that went off accidentally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was trying to pick it up, and it went off and snapped right on his...  We're all trying to pick our spot in the trap.  Right on his fingernail.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that like bent your knuckle.  Fuck, I might have broken my finger.  I'm not even kidding.  It is sideways.  Oh, shit.  There is no enjoyment on his face right now. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to John in Virginia.  John?  I'm looking at the mouse, the computer mouse.  I keep thinking I'm inadvertently grabbing the trap.  I'm surfing the web.  John?  Hey, guys.  Hey, I just want to know, what are y'all going to have Pat Kamunaki do when y'all give  the money to him at the past race?  Yeah, he's coming in Friday for American Mess, right?  Yes.  That's true.  Open call this Friday.  We're looking for the next batch of freaks.  Every Friday, we're going to do an open call for freaks. 
[00:43:30]  It's called American Mess.  Just show up at the station any time Friday.  Y'all going to make him get naked and crawl around a little bit?  No.  You don't want to see Pat naked?  No.  We'll come up with something for Pat to do to get his money.  All right, boys.  I'm punching out.  Thank God you are.  All right.  Got to give it up to the listeners, by the way.  We didn't even solicit it or anything.  They just took it upon themselves to set up a PayPal account, donated $10 here, $20 there, 
[00:44:00]  and actually got $2,000 for Patty from her back rent.  Animals with a heart of gold.  Right.  Animals with a heart of gold.  Because they know that we're not just going to hand her over a check.  They knew it was well worth that money, the entertainment they were going to get.  And then Pat, who's, we did a Cribs, an episode of Cribs, blatantly ripping off MTV, but did  an episode of Cribs over at his trailer.  That's our own spin on it, though.  That's why it's not really a ripoff at all. 
[00:44:30]  And it was just, his place is the worst hovel anyone could live in.  I don't know how he goes there every night and doesn't put a bullet in his head.  It is horrid.  Well, you know, here's where the hot water heater fell through the floor.  And he shows like a hole in the floor where the heater fell through.  And then he goes, and here's where I fell through.  One day he was walking in his home.  If you're walking in your home, whether it's a trailer or a nice house, 
[00:45:00]  and your leg goes through the floor and you're there with your knee on, one knee on the floor  and the other leg hitting mud under your trailer, ah, you're in a bad place.  What a failure.  Just a complete and utter failure.  How's he paying for this?  White male, heterosexual.  How's he even hearing the show?  I don't know.  Patty hears the show, too.  It's amazing.  $2,000 in debt.  They get their priorities in order?  Yeah.  Well, yes, they do.  Yes, they do.  I'm not complaining, honestly.  But it just begs the question, if I have no hot water heater and I walk in my trailer 
[00:45:30]  and I hit mud, but I still have my MiFi in my 12 months of trip.  It's a tribute to how good XM is.  Absolutely.  And how bad regular radio is.  One of the highest rated channels.  Free FM.  And how bad some people are with their money.  Yeah.  That's how idiotic you really are.  Absolutely.  You morons.  Oh, no.  Pay your rent.  You don't have to hear this drivel every day.  This guy's going to try a Deer Hunter mousetrap reference.  Oh, boy.  Sinner in Queens. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, man.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up?  Yeah, I was wondering if at the end of the day, is the bit going to end with like five  or ten Vietnamese guys pounding money at you guys chanting Mao?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  It's not good.  It's going to be a long day for you later.  It's going to be a long...  You dick.  But Travis let that through.  Travis?  Yeah, Travis.  Get in here.  Travis, get in here.  Come on, Travis.  That's not...  Take your medicine.  We'll take Bill's trap here.  I'm more than willing to take mousetraps today. 
[00:46:30]  Finger in.  Finger in.  That was an awful call screen.  I've never seen Deer Hunter before, so I...  All right.  So I'm...  Wow, you're trying to put through movie references on movies you hadn't seen.  I was taking his word.  You ever hear of the Internet?  That's great.  Why, are you going to let through fried green tomatoes references next?  No.  You should stick your face in that thing.  Let's go.  The whole hand or just...  Just your finger.  Whatever you want to do.  He's kind of built like a mouse, isn't he? 
[00:47:00]  He's fidgeting like one right now.  Look at the paw.  Just do it, man.  Get it over with.  Just do it.  Just get it over with.  Just get it over with.  Oh!  Oh!  Wow!  Oh, it's stuck on his hand.  Oh, that was a good one.  Now get back in your hole.  Just for the record, Anthony's the only one in the room thus far that's not...  Oh, I did it.  Oh, that's right.  You're stuck in it.  He got one.  You know, you should get one for not remembering I got one.  I'll do that.  Here's some of the door.  I'm an asshole. 
[00:47:30]  Sorry.  We need another one.  Yeah, you get one for not paying attention.  I'm not paying attention.  Yeah, take Opie's evil one.  You should take these over.  There you go.  I should take this to the movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ow!  Oh!  Whoa!  Whoa!  You just can't think about it.  You just got to go.  You got to go for it.  You got to go.  You kind of forget how much it hurts until you do it again.  You know what?  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  The first one didn't hurt that bad.  I know why that one hurt. 
[00:48:00]  You're pretty stupid.  Right on the knuckle.  Y'all think you know about mousetraps?  I'll tell you about mousetraps.  That one wasn't on a solid surface.  That's why that one hurt so much more.  Let's go to Ed in Connecticut.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hello, Ed.  Hey, listen.  I know everybody's thanking Elo for Opie and Anthony, but I want to publicly thank my brother,  John, for getting me the gift of XM for Christmas.  You know, I turned him on to you guys years ago on NEW.  Yeah.  And this Christmas, he gave me the XM radio and basically just said, hey, I'm spreading 
[00:48:30]  the virus again.  Awesome.  I just want to thank him.  And he's going to cost me a little money now because now I've got to start paying for  it.  But what the hell?  You guys are worth it.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Word, man.  Thank you.  Get easy.  Let's go to Jeremy.  Jeremy, what's up?  Yeah, since you got Elo in the studio, maybe you could enlighten us on those guidelines  that XM had for you guys in the beginning.  There are none.  It's a clever ruse.  He just had to look good in the press. 
[00:49:00]  Let's say hi to Mike in D.C.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how was it going?  Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I just wanted to let you know that Ron and Fez were bitching yesterday because you delayed  their show because of Patty's swamp ass that was smelling throughout the studio.  Was that a...  See, that's why I love where I sit here in the studio.  So I'm away from most of the...  The swamp ass?  Swamp ass that comes into the studio.  And I heard, yeah, was there something emanating from her? 
[00:49:30]  There was a...  Nude body?  There was something waffling.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're going to get nude and get on all fours, you better be squeaky clean.  Yeah.  Also, I don't think you need that level of stress.  That might have to do with it.  It's going to bring up the smell.  That could bring it, yeah, right up to your nose.  Stress just dripping out of your pores.  That was the longest wait for a laugh I ever had.  I was like, in my head, that was funny, right?  That was very funny.  Oh, thank God.  Making your own pudding. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  You know, details like that are unnecessary.  I'm sorry.  Let's say hi to Mark in SD, South Dakota, I guess.  Mark?  Hey, boy.  Hey, man.  Elo needs to be corrected for saying the term orifices and then listing appendages such as  fingers and toes.  Nah, we're not doing this for flubbed lines.  Yeah, we're just doing this for bops.  Bad use of the English language.  He's lying in an orifice, by the way.  I think it would be actually nice to watch that.  All right.  He could see it.  Watch it out.  We'll do it next time with Patty. 
[00:50:30]  Very, very good.  Lube it up.  Yeah, I know.  We all have now.  It is swelling.  Now we all have the rectangular mark of the mousetrap.  I'm going to be on good morning America here in, you know, an hour and a half.  Are you going to be on TV?  No, it was a press conference afterwards.  Robin Robin said, hey, what happened?  Well, I was on O&A today and I stuck my hand in two mousetraps today.  Yeah.  Black welts rubbing it.  Wasn't funny enough.  It's the standards by which we operate here.  If you're not funny, torture.  Those guys throw down over there.  Let's go to Nick. 
[00:51:00]  That's over there.  Nick in Utah.  Nick.  Hello.  Hey.  I just wanted to ask you a little question.  Yeah.  I was wondering if it was possible to get video on the DirecTV feed.  No, I mean, it's a complicated answer, but it has to do with the capacity that they have,  and it's really audio only for those channels.  Bandwidth, right?  Bandwidth, right.  Yes.  It's a bandwidth problem.  It's a bandwidth.  It's the same.  I mean, DirecTV has a finite amount of bandwidth, just like we do.  It's a limited number of channels.  Elo, are you into the pal talk?  Yeah, actually, I haven't got on my new computer today.  I haven't got into the, I've got my camera. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, my account's, Wiki got me all set up.  Yeah.  So.  You've got to get on there.  You know what?  Half, this is only half.  Half, the fun is the fans being able to look in during the show.  The other half starts at night.  Yeah.  There are parties that go on in these rooms that range from nudity and sexual hijinks going  on that you can suggest what the couple does, what the girl does.  Physics.  Physics.  I've never been to those. 
[00:52:00]  I've never been to those rooms.  But there's also karaoke night.  I believe last Friday night was karaoke night where people.  Wow.  And some guy singing into his cock.  The best part is you never have to leave your house, which is something I love.  All of my friends are two-dimensional.  And they are right there on the monitor.  I never have to see them in real life.  It's wonderful.  What's amazing, though, is that people don't think about the room.  I mean, to me, it's like the person. 
[00:52:30]  But then you actually, I start, I look at the room.  I look at the books and all the crap they have in the room.  Oh, everything in the background and stuff.  To me, that's the thing that's the most interesting.  It's not what the person's doing.  It's like, what a pigsty.  Build a set.  You are wrecked.  Clean up.  Build a set.  Clean up your house.  Build a set.  Build a set.  Now, that'd be good.  You have some, like, fake facade of a mansion behind you.  Right.  You live in a shithole.  Right.  You have a staircase or something.  Yeah, a big spiral staircase.  If you're trying to pick up chicks, it's like, hey, this is my crib. 
[00:53:00]  Don't mind the bathroom and the bed in the same room here.  It's my studio.  They show up.  It looks a lot bigger on the inside.  Come on in.  In more ways than one.  That moth from fucking, what is that movie?  God damn it.  You can't think about it.  You just got to do it.  Silence of the Lambs.  Silence of the Lambs.  Shit.  Well, that won't hurt. 
[00:53:30]  You had to, though.  The pal talk is blowing up, though.  This show is becoming a lifestyle.  It's great.  It's not even about radio anymore.  Yeah, after the show is over.  It's just a part of what this O&H thing is about.  After the show is over, the fans continue doing things.  On the message board on whackbag.com, the Photoshop thread.  The mouse drive is set again.  The Photoshop thread over there, this is where people just, on a daily basis, take whatever we talk about on the show and use Photoshop and make humorous little pictures using cutouts of Steve or Opie or me or anybody from the show. 
[00:54:00]  And put them in weird situations.  It's gotten to the point now, though, where now it's full motion video.  Photoshop's that people are putting together using other programs.  I did one last night.  Did you see it, Steve?  No.  All right.  What?  What did I make?  I'll show you.  Wait a second.  He's going to be on the mic?  Okay.  All right, Steve.  I got two right in front of me.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  Oh, he's going to go for a double. 
[00:54:30]  No, I did it last night.  It was, it's you at the movie theater watching Brokeback Mountain.  Uh-oh.  That's all.  It's in the Photoshop section on my whackbag.  I'm sure I'll have to check it out.  What was I doing?  You're going to have to link it.  I don't know if it's Anthony Thompson.  I will.  I don't know.  That movie kind of bombed, right?  As much as they're falling all over themselves.  Very limited release.  No.  It's going into more theaters.  Yeah, more theaters now.  It's in more.  It's over.  It'll do very well.  Now, I'm going to go out on a limb here. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Going out on a limb here.  You know what?  You should tease this so we can take a break.  All right.  The radio tease.  My review.  Brokeback Mountain.  I'm sure people are just hanging up.  Well, Matt and Yonkers.  Matt.  Hey, I just want to thank you guys for hooking up with Pal Talk.  Because watching you guys recoil in fear every time one of these traps are passed around.  I know.  A bunch of pussies.  It's like we're passing the Eads around.  How many people are in the Pal Talk rooms today? 
[00:55:30]  I don't know.  How many we got?  As you find out, Pugglefucker, what's up?  Hey, Paul, what's going on?  Hey.  What's your name?  How many fucking CEOs do the shit that Elo does?  That has got to be the coolest boss on the planet.  He absolutely is.  And I think you ought to give him an O&A t-shirt and a couple mousetraps to take to Charlie and Diane this morning.  And just tell Charlie, you've got to do it, man.  You've got to do it.  Yeah, that would be funny if they did that.  I'll take one down and see what happens. 
[00:56:00]  Good morning, America.  All right, Pugglefucker.  Thank you.  Thank you, buddy.  The O&A mousetrap.  Just in time for Valentine's Day.  Give it to your loved ones.  Let it be known, Elo believes in us in this fine radio show.  Without question.  When we first got to XM, that was questionable before Elo came aboard.  Nick in Canada, what's up?  Hey, you guys are fucking wrong.  I just got a question for Elo.  Yeah.  Are those new portable units, Pioneer and the Samsung, are they coming out in Canada here?  Yes.  You'll be able to use those in Canada? 
[00:56:30]  Absolutely right.  We should talk about that, because you were showing Bill Burr the new portable unit today.  Yeah, I brought the Helix in.  That's the Samsung one.  Because Bill was showing off his new...  Two days after I buy a fucking iPod.  He buys a new iPod, I go just wasting money on an iPod.  Can you believe that?  Yeah.  It's amazing, though.  When are they coming out?  End of March.  End of March.  End of March, yeah.  Definitely end of March.  Like a Swiss Army knife.  Yeah.  Technology.  That's what it's turning into.  Yeah, it's a laptop.  It's amazing.  A pan opener.  It's amazing.  It's also more durable than it seems on the iPod. 
[00:57:00]  It seems very fragile, the iPod.  It's got a nice rubber back to it.  Yep, that's great.  No, they're...  The CES, we won Best of CES, which is a huge thing, because they unveil every piece of electronics  equipment there.  Everything.  I mean, at CES.  And we won People's Choice Awards, voted the Best Device of the Year.  People were so...  Everybody that came over to the display was so impressed by it.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  They loved it.  Yeah, that's Stowe.  That's a guy, Stowe, down in Florida, who does all this stuff. 
[00:57:30]  And I love my MiFi, and I cannot wait to get the new ones.  And the new ones, like the smaller...  And you can actually put your MP3s on it, so it's just amazing.  It's almost like a fucking hand grenade now.  It's like a weapon.  Yeah.  I still proudly walk around with that thing.  I have no problem walking around with the MiFi, but these new ones, where you'll be able  to walk around and listen to live satellite...  And true live satellite...  Right.  And download your MP3s into the thing.  That's amazing.  Which is the best thing in the world.  Well, I have one question.  I can, real quick.  You know, one of the things we were talking about, and one of the things we should talk 
[00:58:00]  about after the show, though, is about a road trip for you guys to go up there.  I mean, I've gotten calls from our partners up there who want to bring you guys to Toronto,  and we just need to figure out, you know, when we want to go up and go see...  Yeah, when spring hits in July, we'll go up.  Hilo, is this talk after the show going to be more than five minutes long?  It could be a half hour, though.  Because, uh...  Wait, we're talking after the show tonight?  I got business to tend to.  Very busy, man.  We like you.  We don't like you that much. 
[00:58:30]  That's the only way I can...  Say what you have to say on the show.  That's what I'm saying.  The only way I can figure out we can get this program out is to come here.  Let's do it on the air.  If I'm not looking at the awning of the Parker Meridian Hotel at 11.05, I panic.  Well, the issue is, we have to figure out how to get you guys up there,  so now I'm paranoid to even talk about even an idea for the show to go down to New Orleans  because I'm going to get mousetrapped if it's a stupid idea.  We want to go up to Toronto or Montreal when it gets warm.  When it gets warm.  So I need somebody from Canada to let me know when does warm get... 
[00:59:00]  I mean, what is warm there?  We're talking June.  June, okay.  June?  I think middle of the summer.  July.  July.  July or August.  I don't know.  Early August, late July.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve?  Yes, sir.  What's up?  Just wanted to let you guys know that I love your show.  You guys have got to ditch one of those NASCAR channels.  There's five of them, for crying out loud.  I put Ron and Fez on their own channel, and I want to hear you guys all day.  I'm in and out of the truck, like, constantly, and I miss, like, sections of the show, 
[00:59:30]  and when you guys used to loop it around all day, I'd catch the show, you know, on and off all day.  I don't know if I had five NASCAR channels.  I don't know.  Five?  There really are.  I would probably know that.  There's five country music stations, at least four.  There's got to be at least four channels labeled NASCAR.  Yeah.  Four channels.  Elo, comment?  We don't have four NASCAR channels, so he should go in the mousetrap.  I'll be by proxy.  I was only going to get my O&A from 11 to 3.  All right.  We will work on giving your O&A from 11 to 3. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, look at that.  A little tease, by the way.  Oh, man.  There you go.  There's some things in the works there, Steve.  And, by the way, I will merely say this, as my kind of parting tease, is that there has been one request made by probably every O&A pest for something from XM.  And it's something that I'm going to make happen, probably no later than mid-March. 
[01:00:30]  Ooh, that is mysterious.  Wow, that is mysterious.  What the hell is that?  And exciting.  And you don't even know what I'm talking about.  No, I don't.  I don't either.  Yes, it is.  Can you write it down so we can, like, do the...  Something.  Well, we'll talk after the show.  No, we can do the...  Every pest...  Ah, he's got you now.  Damn it.  You're going to be here until 11.  Just so we can go, oh.  The verbal mousetrap I've got to sit through after the show.  Let's see.  A couple more things before we get rid of Elo here.  Let's see, right.  Let's go to Leo in Cleveland.  Wow. 
[01:01:00]  Leo.  Half a billion dollar contract for O&A.  That is what everybody wants.  Fellas, this mousetrap thing is fucking brilliant.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait.  Make sure I can't get on Pal Talk.  Cover it up.  I got an Elo communique that I'm passing around the room.  Let me see.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, okay.  I know you're happy.  Oh, can I ruin a bit?  No bit ruining guy.  Hey, you know what?  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  If you put your penis in that mousetrap right now.  Oh, no.  I'll tell you what it is.  No. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Jesus Christ.  What's wrong?  Look, Jesus Christ.  I mean, look.  Everything had a price.  We're all just having fun.  Yeah.  I saw what it was.  It's not worth that.  I just...  Because someone's going to come in here and do it to see what it was.  This was all about having fun.  See, that's the Brokeback Mountain.  I haven't seen this.  Well, you see, you go down the Brokeback Mountain.  It takes a lot to fucking gross people.  You know what?  You dick.  Elo got another one.  Elo went from, I'm not doing the mousetrap. 
[01:02:00]  He's up to three or four already.  I love how that one's built.  Like he was slowly losing just support in the room.  Oh, the air went out.  I was like, I got sold out by this one over here.  Ant is like, popcorn.  It's the Brokeback Mountain screening that Steve is in.  You know what?  Oh, come on.  The liquor comes out of a popcorn box.  A little surprise.  All right.  Go to Photoshop and see Anthony's little video he made of Steve at Brokeback Mountain. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Let's go to Leo in Cleveland.  Leo, you said what you had to say, right?  Guys, this fucking mousetrap thing is brilliant.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're not sticking your hand in it three times in the last hour.  Hey, how come I have to fucking reload it?  You're the one who messed up.  All right.  Got to reload.  Let's do it.  Look at this.  Look at this welt.  Look at this.  That is a pretty big welt.  Look at that.  You know what?  You got it way at the tip of your palm there.  That is red and going to leave.  It's going to swell.  That's going to be a black and blue now. 
[01:03:00]  Look at this.  Get a picture of that for the website.  Get a picture of his hand for the website.  Oh, my God.  Know why that happened?  It looks like you were bitten by a mongoloid.  Like, it's just squared off tooth marks.  See, Dr. Paddy just nod on my hand.  See, look.  Some old lady with no teeth.  The secret is to have it on a hard surface.  I was handing over the mousetrap and he did it.  Yeah.  Oh, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  That was almost a misfire.  Bill has such a hard time loading a mousetrap. 
[01:03:30]  It is the simplest thing to do.  Stop fucking staring at me.  I'll be loading mousetraps and bananas.  It was your idea.  When you're at the stress factory, you should have mousetraps loaded.  Oh, God.  In case one of your bombs, one of your...  That was great, eh? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in California.  John.  Hey, John.  Hi.  Hi, John.  Hello.  Hello, John.  You're on the air, sir.  Hello.  I'm calling to congratulate Bill on such a brilliant fit for this morning.  Thank you. 
[01:04:30]  What?  The guy is really...  No, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take the mousetrap.  Travis has to take that again.  Travis let this guy through for what?  For what?  Because this guy is trying to bomb on purpose.  I'm not trying to bomb on purpose.  I was calling to congratulate Bill on such a brilliant fit this morning.  That's not bad.  He's just...  That's not bad.  No, again.  Travis?  Let everyone slide on that one. 
[01:05:00]  Please?  I pardon you.  All right.  We should take a break.  All right, guys.  Mousetrap set.  What better way to go to a break than have an intern get slammed in a mousetrap?  I don't think you should write him off.  That is true.  If we let one guy off the hook, then what?  The next guy?  Oh, well, let's let him off the hook.  At least say that it's a slippery slope.  The system fails.  Can't do it.  The system fails.  Can't do it.  Travis?  Get in here.  Front and center.  Yeah.  You got to get in here and take your medicine.  Wow.  I'm afraid because there's so many on the console here that I'm going to accidentally... 
[01:05:30]  Just move the whole paper.  Oh!  Oh, Steve almost got nailed.  Just move the whole paper.  What did I do?  You let a bit.  Don't quit.  Just don't ask.  Oh, he was good.  You led through that caller that had nothing.  Well, now we've got four still.  Oh, this is...  Bill had already been congratulated.  But he needs...  Look at Steve pulling away.  There's a trap to get him.  Travis is too skinny to do this, Bill.  I know.  This could break his arm.  Snap an arm.  Break a bone. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Go ahead.  Now we can go to break.  Yeah.  That's the way you go to break.  That's the way you do it.  Discipline, Opie.  All right.  I'm going to the same square with mousetraps.  All right, Elo.  Pleasure seeing you again.  See you.  Press conference with Good Morning America.  That's very cool.  Yeah.  9.15.  Yeah.  And put some ice in that hand.  That's really funny.  And fucking wealth. 
[01:06:30]  He really has a wealth on that hand, man.  I do.  It hurts.  You know what he has?  He has executive hands.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  From counting money all your life, Mr. Hooper.  Oh, Elo, we're going to get into something today.  Bubba wanted to work for XM.  We didn't want him, right?  Yep.  Fact.  Fact.  Fact.  Thank you.  All right, because we're going to get into something a little while.  And I want it from the boss's mouth, because we're going to go off on a little rant.  I've known him for a long time in Tampa.  But it wasn't worth it to XM, right, to bring Bubba aboard.  We had...  It wasn't worth it for XM to bring Howard aboard. 
[01:07:00]  That's right.  We had...  The numbers did not make sense.  The numbers did not make sense.  We had the show we wanted, which was O&A.  There we go.  End of the conversation.  I love it.  All right, because Bubba's just spewing stupid things.  And by the way, I mean, in full disclosure, it's like Ron and Fez are here because, you  know, you guys and us collectively thought, because they were part of our family...  Love the Ron and Fez.  Right.  Love them guys.  Yeah, and they complement what we do.  They're great.  And so, you know, I get phone calls every single day from people who want to get on and on 
[01:07:30]  and on.  And I just...  The answer is the same.  We have what we want.  We don't need anything else right now.  Yep.  All right.  That's where we are.  From the horse's mouth.  Elo, thank you so much for coming in.  If you want to meet after the show, I'll give you the number to my Escalator.  I will be on the expressway.  We will do it over the phone.  A tel con, as we'd say.  Yeah, tel con.  All right.  It's tel con.  And we have a brand new country song today, Straight for the Shower.  Straight for the Shower today?  Straight for the Shower came in. 
[01:08:00]  I love these country songs.  It's hilarious.  Stop it with the country stuff.  You're killing me.  In honor of that Silence of the Lamb bomb that you had, we're going to do Silence of the  Lamb, the musical.  Okay.  Now, that's funny.  It's these two guys, the Kaplan brothers, they made a musical based on the Silence of  the Lambs.  Which song are we hearing?  Put the effing lotion in the basket.  My favorite.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose. 
[01:08:30]  And when it's done, there's one more thing, a simple little task.  It's put the effing lotion in the basket.  Put the effing lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them itch instead of by their names. 
[01:09:00]  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  Most of you, so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying now, you big fat moose.  Just put the effing lotion on your skin.  And then put the effing lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining. 
[01:09:30]  So I count it for I jam a bump.  I count your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got one in.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to your screaming whale.  Keep it down, you fucking whale.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed. 
[01:10:00]  Luscious, she's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of steel.  They don't sell mangroves in a fucking store. 
[01:10:30]  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you if you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:11:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Bill Byrne's studio, he's playing Stress Factory.  That's right.  All weekend long, starting tomorrow night. 
[01:11:30]  It's going to be easy after extreme comedy.  Extreme comedy.  Extreme comedy.  On the Opie and Anthony program.  It's extreme.  X comedy.  All right, we got a lot to do on the show.  Like every day.  Dude, I'm stoked.  Chris Penn died.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Sean Penn's brother.  Oh, no.  Michael Penn's brother.  Maybe that's why he died.  Michael Penn. 
[01:12:00]  He did that song.  Yeah.  That one song.  That song.  He did a song once.  Yeah.  That song.  But I bet you he's still performing somewhere.  You know, when they do, like, a look back at the 80s bands and stuff, you realize they  never went away.  We went away.  Well, we just left.  We just left.  Left them sitting there.  They're playing, like, county fairs.  Yeah, they're still playing.  They do these behind the music, whatever they're called these days, and you realize they never 
[01:12:30]  stopped.  We just stopped going.  Yeah.  Instead of going, instead of filling out Madison Square Garden or whatever, it's, yeah, like  you said, the county fair or some tiny little club in the village.  I saw, like, what I couldn't believe as far as, like, a recent thing.  I saw Ja Rule was playing B.B. Kings.  Really?  Huh.  Yeah, he was happening.  He was a Madison Square Garden guy.  Yeah, I couldn't tell you if he was still happening or not.  Right, well. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, you weren't at that one?  Not into the hip-hop.  A lot of the 80s bands, though.  I should have known better than to bring that up on this show.  What?  Huh?  What?  Well, it's my fault because you don't fucking listen to...  That's fucking bullshit.  I listen to the...  Oh, ow, ow.  Wow, that's right on the...  That's right where the other mark was on your hand.  You're not even trying to move it around a little bit.  I know.  Oh, he decides I'll just destroy one part of my hand.  Yeah.  That was bullshit. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, that was.  I was just questioning it.  You could have, like, argued the point.  I think that was Bill calling us racist.  Like, he should have known to bring up, like, a black artist and...  Yeah.  No, I wasn't saying that.  No?  That's just your guilty conscience.  Oh.  Well, what do we know about Chris Penn today?  We...  I know he's dead.  We interviewed him a couple times on the show.  I felt bad about that when I read it.  He's a good guy.  He was 43 years old.  Yeah, he was a mess, though.  You look at Sean Penn, at least the guy, you know, kept in shape or keeps in shape to  some extent, and his brother there was just a bloated mess. 
[01:14:00]  Could be a heart attack, huh?  Fat guy.  Could be.  Drugs?  Don't know.  If there were drugs and fat involved together there in the body, oof.  Oof.  Actor Chris Penn, a younger brother of Oscar winner, Sean Penn, was found dead yesterday  inside an apartment near the L.A. suburb of Santa Monica.  I love that guy, man.  I thought he was great.  He was.  No cause of death was immediately determined.  He's just going to decide.  No signs of foul play.  Out of the fucking blue.  Daddy, did you see that?  What? 
[01:14:30]  The guy found me on the ground.  He tried to fuck me.  You wish.  You sick bastard, Vic.  You tried to fuck me in my father's office.  Look, Vic.  Whatever you want to do in the privacy of your own home, go to it.  But don't try to fuck me.  I mean, I don't think you're that way.  I like you a lot, buddy, but I don't think you're that way.  Reservoir Dogs.  One of the greatest movies ever.  That's the Michael Madsen scene.  You know, four years fucking pumps up the ass.  You appreciate a piece of prime rib when you see it.  My great. 
[01:15:00]  Prime rib.  You're telling me that now that this man is free.  And we're making good in our commitment to him.  He's just going to decide out of the fucking blue to rip us off?  Why don't you tell me what really happened?  What really happened?  Don't make me do this.  Now stop pouring this fucking gun in my dead!  Wow.  Fantastic, Larry. 
[01:15:30]  I'm a cop.  Also the voice of...  Larry.  I'm a...  Larry.  I'm so fucking sorry.  Also the big voice...  No!  No!  I'm a cop, Larry!  No!  Come on!  I'm so fucking sorry, Larry!  No! 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, that was a good one.  Also the voice in Grand Theft Auto.  Oh, yeah!  Forgot about that.  Who's the star of Grand Theft Auto?  So there you go.  Yeah.  We'll find out more about that as the days go on here, right?  Mm-hmm.  Uh...  43 years old.  What was that movie he did with Eric Stoltz?  Hmm.  Long, long time ago.  He was like the athlete.  He was doing sit-ups. 
[01:16:30]  Had the weights on his head.  Oh, right.  He had that helmet with the dildo on it, it looked like.  And there were weights on there.  And the unfunny kid from Weird Science...  Yeah.  ...was starring in that.  Right.  Wow.  Don't remember the name.  No clue.  Couldn't tell you the name.  Anyone...  What year was it about?  ...was fan no?  What year was it?  He's going to IMDb.  That's where we're at.  What year was it about?  Early 80s, please.  Early 80s?  I'm really hoping this was the movie he was in or... 
[01:17:00]  You're not talking about Rumble Fish, right?  No.  No.  All the Right Moves?  No.  Footloose?  No.  He was in that.  Pale Rider?  No.  At Close Range?  Might have been that.  No, no.  That was with Sean Penn.  Uh, I don't know.  Let's see.  No one's, uh...  No one has that one.  No one's coming up with it.  No idea.  He was in a movie with Eric Stoltz.  I'm standing by that.  Well, hit the Eric Stoltz. 
[01:17:30]  You could cross-reference at the bottom.  Yeah, cross-reference at the bottom there and we'll get it.  I mean, you scroll all the way down to IMDb.  There's a place you could put two actors in.  Line 4 has it.  Wildlife?  Maybe that was it.  Let's go to Jeremy in Jersey.  He's in shape in that movie.  Jeremy.  What's up, buddy?  Wildlife.  I'm pretty sure it's the wildlife.  You got it.  Eric Stoltz was Bill Conrad and Chris Penn was Tom Drake.  I'm Bill Conrad.  My family here.  I have a daughter, a wife. 
[01:18:00]  I'm from Wisconsin.  Wisconsin.  Bill Conrad.  How a pleasure to meet you.  I'm Bill Conrad.  USA.  USA all the way.  All right, Jeremy.  All right, punch it out.  Good one.  Jeremy from New Jersey.  Wildlife.  All right.  Moving on to happier things, I guess.  There's a guy that wants to wear a skirt to school.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  I saw this this morning.  That's nice.  Some fat dude wants to go to school with a skirt.  Is this one of these things where he's pushing the envelope man and, you know, showing the  authorities that they can't put a dress code on a certain people man without...  He's showing the double standard.  Yeah, man.  Guys aren't allowed to wear shorts to school.  Put pants on and go to school, ass.  Yeah, what the fuck is his dad?  Yeah, to just smack him in the head.  Guys aren't allowed to wear shorts, but girls are allowed to wear skirts.  Just pull that dress over his head and give him some uppercuts like old school hockey. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, pull it over his head so he can't fight back.  Just bash him.  You want to wear a dress, faggot?  All right.  Here's what you're going to be in store for at school if you wear a dress.  Well, we'll have to go to that a little later in the program.  Oh, really?  Because my copy's not working.  I could do my review.  Someone should freaking do the mousetrap for that.  Someone should be punished.  Who should be punished?  Who made the desk?  Me?  Who? 
[01:19:30]  Man.  Fan?  Wow, Fan never does anything wrong, though.  Well, he just did.  He's almost perfect.  He's fantastic.  Because he got the audio of that story for the show.  If it's not working, he's got to do it.  If it is working, then E-Rock's got to do it because he wasn't able to figure it out in studio.  E-Rock?  All right, we'll get to the bottom of that in a second.  Anthony, you shocked everybody in the back office before the show today.  I don't think it was very shocking. 
[01:20:00]  I...  Get Steve in here, by the way.  Yeah, we need Steve in here because I think Steve was just saying what he thinks everybody wanted to hear yesterday.  That's what I think Steve was doing.  I don't think he was being honest.  Steve?  Hello, Steve.  Hi.  I linked up your animation, by the way.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It's on openanthony.com?  I hate the fact that I've got to put it in a GIF file.  I can shrink it down.  It looks so much better in QuickTime.  I can convert it in.  Yeah, please.  It'll be smaller, too.  I got the QuickTime file. 
[01:20:30]  I'll send it to you.  Okay, cool.  It just looks better.  My art is being destroyed by compression.  My art...  Oh, that's what you're worried about.  Yes.  It's a little big, though, when you do it at QuickTime.  It's huge.  I know.  Much like Steve.  Thank you.  Big man.  But now I...  Steve went to the movies.  That was just babble.  Of course it was.  That was just tech babble.  It's, uh...  This is all I heard.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, because no one knows about QuickTime.  No.  Exactly.  I don't know.  I don't.  No?  Mm-mm. 
[01:21:00]  I couldn't make a QuickTime video.  Maybe you're MySpace.  50% of the page would look better if you did know about something like...  Oh, and then they can get shut down like Bobby Kelly?  Yeah, by copyright infringement.  Dude, I lost all my friends, dude.  That's a great Bobby Kelly, man.  Dude.  Fucking Bobby Kelly.  My first job was to sabotage all my friends, dude.  I sell everybody out.  Oh, yeah, that's him.  Rather than reach out for help, he's nagging everybody down with him.  That's Bob.  Dude, I found it.  Give me a hand.  Ha! 
[01:21:30]  He pulls you into the water.  All right, let's get into this.  All right, Steve.  Yeah.  When was it?  Yesterday?  The day before yesterday, I guess, you saw Brokeback Mountain.  Oh, no, I saw it over the weekend.  Over the weekend.  You...  Oh, that's a lovely song.  You went to the movies?  Right.  To see it?  See, I don't...  Who'd you go with?  Wife.  Ah.  The wife.  The beard.  Yes.  The beard.  And by wife, he means a guy named Robert.  Ed.  Who likes to wear skirts to school. 
[01:22:00]  So you went to see...  It's his preference.  It's okay.  Brokeback Mountain.  Yeah.  And you said...  What?  About...  It was boring.  I...  You know, I'm...  I...  Can I interrupt here?  Uh-huh.  Just Dan is trying to come in under the radar.  Oh, with a new working disc?  Is that what you're trying to switcheroo?  Yeah.  He's trying the old switcheroo?  No, I'm not.  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, way to go along with the bit there, uh, Thad. 
[01:22:30]  He's one of these martial arts guys.  Yeah.  He just takes the pain.  Thank you, Thad.  You're welcome.  All right.  Now, we'll go back to this later.  Yeah.  Uh, you said it was boring.  I...  Yeah.  I...  I...  I'm not...  I'm not negating the fact that I understand people want to see it because they're curious  about the whole gay cowboy thing.  Ooh, gay cowboys.  I got...  I got that part.  I understand that.  Ooh, curious.  Chris...  I know I'm not...  I can't say anything, so I'm just...  He's just saying what people want to hear.  That's not true at all.  It's absolutely not true. 
[01:23:00]  We're just going to pick up on keywords during your review.  You're just showing off, by the way.  Uh, I saw it last night.  I saw Brokeback Mountain.  No.  I didn't go to the movies.  Steve had, uh...  I found, uh...  I found a copy on DVD.  Was it in a rest area?  I was able to watch it in the comfort of my own home.  He got it from one of those...  In the comfort of my own homo.  He got it off the street from one of those Korean, uh...  People.  No, it was in a rest area.  I don't know.  It was some kind of copy that something kept scrolling on the bottom about awards. 
[01:23:30]  Every hour or so in the movie, something scrolled about property of and for awards consideration.  And it didn't really distract the viewing from the film or anything.  But I'll go out on a limb here, and I'll be completely honest.  Why would you go see that?  Seriously.  I didn't go.  I sat at home.  I mean, why would you see that?  Uh, because a lot of people are talking about it.  A lot of people are talking about it.  They're not.  They kind of are. 
[01:24:00]  They aren't.  Dude, it just won four Golden Globes.  Yes.  Yeah.  So they're talking about it.  Those guys are talking about it.  How much money did it make at the box office?  I don't know.  It's all bullshit.  It didn't make a lot, but it hadn't gone into wide release.  Yeah, exactly.  It was only in limited release.  It had the potential to make a lot of money.  Really?  So you're telling me when that goes into wide release across Nebraska, people are going  to be lining up to see gay cowboys?  You're probably right.  The Midwest probably have a problem with this.  Right.  My only problem is it looks like a boring chick flick.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  I'll give you that. 
[01:24:30]  Much like Spider-Man.  For what if Spider-Man...  They turned Spider-Man into a fucking chick flick.  I don't like that whole love interest thing there.  Just kick some ass.  Get it out.  Kick some ass.  Swing around on a web.  Get it out.  It's character development.  It's character development.  But it was...  It wasn't a bad movie.  Yes, it was.  It wasn't a bad movie.  For what it was, it was a fine film.  So what is it about?  Once you get past the fact that they're gay, do they have to bring...  It's a dopey love story.  You've got to bring the herd in.  Take out the chick. 
[01:25:00]  Put in another cock.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And that's what makes it boring.  That's what it is.  We'll compare it.  We'll compare it to a...  All right.  Is it like Uli's Gold?  No, I can't.  It's one of these love over 20 year period movies where it starts in 1963.  They're up in the mountains on Bareback Mountain.  Brokeback Mountain.  Bareback Mountain.  They should have called it that.  No rubbers.  I'm riding him bareback.  1963 now. 
[01:25:30]  Brokeback Mountain.  They're like sheep.  They've got to mine these sheep for this rancher guy.  And they're hanging out, spend a lot of time in tents up on a Brokeback Mountain.  And out of nowhere, out of the fucking blue, the dark haired guy, what's his name?  Gyllenhaal.  Yeah.  He decides he's going to pretty much rape the blonde haired guy. 
[01:26:00]  He was the bottom though.  Yeah, I know, but like he just out of nowhere initiates gay sex with this guy without even  getting an inkling that he was attracted to him or anything.  What?  I'm trying to think.  I don't have the gaydar going.  What did I miss?  There was that whole...  Remember the scene when Heath Ledger is sort of giving himself a washing and you see him  blurry in the background?  That was there for a reason.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, what?  All right, Heath Ledger is by the river, nude, and he's washing himself. 
[01:26:30]  And Gyllenhaal there, Jake, is in the foreground.  He's in the foreground.  And I go, he's going to take a peek.  He's going to take a peek.  But he didn't take the peek.  He doesn't?  He doesn't take the peek.  But that's there for...  Like he's in the presence of naked man and there's sort of an extended shot.  Yeah, I understand the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal is the gay guy. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  He's into Heath Ledger.  Right.  But I don't see how he picked up on Heath Ledger being accepting of him grabbing him and trying  to make out with him in the tent.  Well, he wasn't accepting.  He sort of...  He recoiled the first...  Oh, he recoiled for three seconds and then he got to cock up the guy's ass.  He recoiled right into a cock.  He recoiled, he recoiled, and then the next thing he's unbuckling his big western belt  buckle and fucking Jake in the ass. 
[01:27:30]  You were watching this?  Of course.  I rewound and watched it again and again.  What was the initial period?  The one thing I'm trying to figure out, how long were they on Brokeback Mountain initially?  Was it for a period of months?  Initially, it was for a season, I guess, like a summer.  Three months.  Three months.  Why did they call the movie Brokeback Mountain?  Because that's like the mountain that they went.  And then the whole rest of the movie is Heath Ledger gets married. 
[01:28:00]  He gets his back blown out.  I know.  All you can think of is like he gets boned up the ass so hard he broke his back on this mountain.  It has something to do with breaking horses, right?  No, not at all.  Crazy.  No.  Killing your spirit.  The name of the mountain is Brokeback Mountain.  It's just the name of the mountain.  So they go up there.  The sequel's going to be Ass Rape Valley.  They go up there to do a little of this sheep herding thing.  And they hook up. 
[01:28:30]  Now, Heath Ledger's engaged to be married.  So he comes back after this job is over, gets married, has a couple of kids.  This other guy there, Jake, goes back and hooks up with a girl, gets married.  I guess you're very confused.  And in the 60s, you're not just running out fagging it up, especially out west like that.  So he tries to, you know, fit in.  But he's still like more of the homo.  Jake Gyllenhaal is a gay guy trying to cover it up by getting married. 
[01:29:00]  Heath Ledger is in love with Jake Gyllenhaal.  But that's it.  There's no, like, he doesn't go hunting around for other guys.  He's not looking for ass sex from other guys.  He's just in love with this one guy.  He's a relationship guy.  Yeah, a relationship guy.  He's a one-man guy.  Jake Gyllenhaal needs some cock.  Needs the cock.  Heath Ledger, which is the only way to do it.  You want to limit.  You don't want to be a whore.  Right.  If you've got to do it.  You're going to be a one-man guy.  If you've got to do it.  One-man guy. 
[01:29:30]  There's only one man with that story.  And that's how it's going to stay.  So he's like that.  And he trollops around.  He goes to Mexico.  He hooks up with other cowboys.  Yeah, yeah.  But over the years, Heath Ledger's marriage breaks down because of this whole thing.  Because every so often, every few years, he'll get a postcard from Jake inviting him back to Brokeback Mountain,  where they hook up, sit around, which is really hysterical. 
[01:30:00]  They sit around a campfire.  They drink whiskey.  They talk about things.  It's like hanging out with your bud.  Also, because it's just like, hey, what's going on?  I don't know.  Horses and this.  And they talk about things.  And then it's followed up with some ass sex.  Right.  It's just like hanging out, talking with your pal, yet you're fucking him.  That's pretty much funny.  That makes it even more creepier because they're both sitting there going, oh, my God.  They had the biggest sail down in fucking Mason.  No.  No, no, no.  Then you could see it coming. 
[01:30:30]  Right, right.  But they're sitting there talking about power tools.  There was no gay, like, talking, no gay mannerisms aside from fucking.  What were they talking about?  It was just talking about anything.  Ranching.  Getting screwed over by the boss.  It was any typical heterosexual conversation during camping trucks.  Yeah.  Things like that.  But then, you know, it was also about, I miss you when you're gone.  And I don't know how to quit you. 
[01:31:00]  I wish I knew how to quit you.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  And, yeah, Heath Ledger, his marriage fails because of this whole thing.  The one scene that is just disturbing is Heath Ledger's with his wife in their apartment.  And Jake pulls up.  It's the first time he's seen him in years.  So he runs downstairs to say hi to him.  They kind of find this stairwell and just start making out. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  Cowboy hats on.  And they're making out.  And the wife opens the door and looks down and sees her husband now making out with this guy.  Her face is priceless.  She should win an award for this horrified face she puts on.  Yeah, she's completely disgusted.  It's Michelle Williams.  But it's not affectionate.  And the marriage is over right there at that point.  That is it.  Is the making out real or is it moving?  Dude, it is making out where they pull apart. 
[01:32:00]  And there is spit between their two lips making out.  What were these guys thinking?  They're thinking you need a happy place.  And I know why Steve didn't really enjoy the movie that much.  Why?  Because he had a very small part right at the beginning and you must have been cut out of the rest.  That was exactly it.  Thank you.  Heath Ledger's walking through the woods.  Oh, big bear comes out of nowhere.  He runs away.  And Steve's part.  I go, look, Steve's in the movie. 
[01:32:30]  That's it.  I was bitter at Tang for cutting me.  And then it takes you from 1963 up until, I guess, the early 80s.  20 years.  Yeah, it's like 20 years or so of this guy trying to deal with the fact that he's in love with a guy  but trying to still, you know, live as a man in Wyoming.  And then this other guy who's more gay but he can't, like, be out of the closet either.  They both are hooking up every so often. 
[01:33:00]  And since he can't see him all that often, he's got it.  Yeah, he hooks up with other people.  Where do they hook up at?  Brokeback Mountain.  The title of the feature.  Let's go to Pat in Boston.  Pat.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  The title of the movie.  I just, I love the part in the treehouse where the guy's like, I hate to go back here.  Yeah, I was expecting a jeep, jeep, jeep in that tent in the first scene.  I didn't see the end.  I just want to know if it ends with a couple of guys in robes and tissues, 80s fags. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  No, there's no robes or tissues or a little Yorkshire terrier and some broth.  Let's go there, Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey, I agree with Steve.  That movie was just, it was totally boring.  And I didn't understand the love I have to expect because those guys, they had very little dialogue.  It was just like a perfect relationship if it was a guy and a girl because there was no talking.  It was just no talking.  Yeah, there really wasn't a foundation for these guys to be so deeply in love with each other.  Other than that, they had to spend a lot of time around each other on a mountain.  Yeah, they spent time around each other. 
[01:34:00]  And I guess that's enough.  I believe it was a mountain called Brokeback Mountain.  Let's go to DJ Wisconsin.  DJ.  Anthony, every finger, every toe, mousetraps.  See, I knew it.  What, it wasn't that bad of a movie.  Did you feel for any of the characters?  I choked up at the end a little bit.  Did you know?  My customer is always right.  That's a paying XM customer. 
[01:34:30]  He could go fuck himself.  I'm not Craig in D.C.  Craig.  Hey, listen, I just needed to call and defend Steve.  Thank you.  Because I've seen several Ang Lee films.  I like the director.  I was really disappointed, and this one was fucking long.  Yeah, it just drags on.  Even if there was a woman in Gyllenhaal's role, and it was just a regular love story,  this would have been a slow-moving, boring movie.  Yeah, absolutely.  The Hulk had more action in the movie. 
[01:35:00]  You know what?  He mentions it's an Ang Lee movie, and he's a really, really good director.  There was a shot at the beginning of the movie where it's a horizon and the blue sky and  clouds, and it was a really nice shot.  So me, I'm watching it with my girlfriend, and I go...  Make sure you say that a lot, by the way.  No, no, I'm not even saying it for that reason, because she was the smartass in this.  I watched it, and I went...  I said, wow, that is a really nice shot. 
[01:35:30]  And she turned and goes, you fucking faggot.  Let's go to Joey in Chocolate City.  Joey!  Yeah, they should come out with a sequel, do the same exact movie, but with two women.  They could call it Munch Mountain.  Out.  Sorry, Opie.  Ow!  I hate you, Joey.  Yeah, that really stunk. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, fuck.  Everybody, you know...  Let's go to Dave in Indiana.  Dave!  Hey, boys, how are you doing today?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, I got a new idea for the mousetraps there.  Not only can they use for punishment and humiliation, how about high-stakes turrets?  Anything?  Well, explain further.  I mean, the idea so far is good.  No, no.  Reset your trap, Opie.  I like the idea.  Why don't you set him up for, like, how many he can set in a certain amount of time and 
[01:36:30]  bet on that.  Well, Twitchels, I think, is coming in Friday.  Maybe we could do something like that.  Oh, that would be cool.  See how long it takes him to set ten traps.  There you go.  It's not a bad idea.  We'll do that bet on Friday when we do American Mess.  American Mess is this Friday.  I hope we get some people down here.  Excellent.  We got two trips to the lingerie bowl that we're giving away to the two biggest freaks  that show up on Friday.  Yeah.  One last thing.  Yep.  Fuck the Indianapolis Colts. 
[01:37:00]  I'm out.  All right.  Yeah, they let you down.  Let's go to Todd in Chester.  Todd.  Hey, I just saw the porn version.  It's called Broke Bag Mountain.  See you later, dudes.  All right.  So, would you recommend this film, Anthony?  I would give it, let's see, how many stars?  I'll go with stars instead of the typical thumbs up that everyone can joke about.  How many boners?  How many boners? 
[01:37:30]  How many tight shirts?  It was long.  How many mustaches?  I've seen many porno mustaches and pork chop sideburns.  How many chaps?  Assless.  I didn't think it was a bad movie.  Between two and three out of four stars.  Is it going to win all the awards?  Yeah, I think it's going to do very well.  That's going to be weird, man.  Does Heath Ledger have an accent? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  I think he's Australian, right?  From Australia.  That was pretty damn good.  Because Heath Ledger kind of mumbled his way through the whole goddamn thing.  Yeah.  That's where acting goes.  I'm sure he's going to get something, but.  Yeah.  Of course they will.  Anytime you do something like this.  Something like that.  Yeah, you're going to be playing a gay guy or a retard.  No matter how boring.  You're in.  Or the Holocaust.  Yeah, yeah.  Holocaust.  You're in.  It was amazing.  It was so brave.  I couldn't believe it.  I felt as if I was there.  All right.  In honor of Brokeback Mountain and Anthony's Review. 
[01:38:30]  You're going to fuck somebody up there?  There's a little bit we did a few years back called,  Hi, Mom.  I'm gay.  Oh.  I think I want the Steelers to win the Super Bowl. 
[01:39:00]  Bill?  Everybody's picking the Steelers.  I think Steelers have a better team.  But Holgram's a better coach for some dumb reason.  I don't know.  I would take Seattle with the points.  Anthony?  I'll be watching Brokeback Mountain on Super Bowl Sunday.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh. 
[01:39:30]  There's our...  Oh, you went with the palm on that one.  Yeah.  Is that worse?  It really hurts both ways.  No.  It doesn't hit the bone.  Ah, mother.  Yeah.  That's more of a pinch than a bone.  Oh, man.  That's bad when it jumps up, huh?  Look at...  Look at this.  Look.  It's like a bite mark.  I know.  I was showing one of mine to Bill.  Opie, try the palm.  Oh, the palm really hurts.  Don't worry.  Dude, you should do it just for the fact you're eating a blueberry pop time.  Don't worry. 
[01:40:00]  I'll be bombing soon.  It's all about the blueberries.  I'll be bombing soon.  Ah, man.  I'm honest with myself.  Yo, you're not kidding with it when it jumps up.  You want to nail it so it stays down.  That's why I nailed E-Lo bad.  Kids at home, if you're doing this?  Yeah.  All the children playing along at home.  Starting tomorrow, the listeners will be playing along at home.  They're going out today and getting their mousetraps.  Don't make us make an official opening Anthony mousetrap.  I hate loading them.  Oh, yeah.  It scares the shit out of me.  All right, we got this.  Dude, how can you deal with guns, then, man? 
[01:40:30]  My hands start shaking the second I get around one.  Guns?  Well, you know what they always do?  I'm not shooting myself with them.  Yeah, but you know how it always is?  The fucking thing always ends up going off.  I mean...  I'm just...  Who are you hanging out with?  I'm saying, you always read in the paper, the guy was cleaning it, or he fucking, he scratched  himself, and next thing you know, he blew his nose off.  People that don't respect the gun.  If you respected that mousetrap as much as you must respect a firearm, you would never,  ever have it smacked down on your hand. 
[01:41:00]  Well, I mean, that can't kill me.  This is true, but I was just kind of speaking figuratively.  Like, you would never have a loaded mousetrap around.  If mousetrap was lethal as guns...  Well, somehow people always, like, you know, took the clip out, and they didn't know there  was one in the chamber.  Yeah, that's stupid.  And then they started talking about Scarface, moving to fucking sea, and he fucking does.  You're right, that's stupid.  The thing you do, whenever you handle a firearm, unless you're going to use it to shoot  at a range or something...  Would you stop going in gun speed? 
[01:41:30]  You take...  Whenever you handle a firearm...  You make certain...  Let's make sure that the...  It is unloaded.  ...projectory.  You take the magazine out, you open it up, you look, and make sure visually that it  is not loaded.  And all your guns are just for target practice, right?  For hunting.  Or if, you know, some riffraff tries to get my house.  See, that's why I like...  No, not hunting.  I'm not a hunter.  You're honest.  Because everyone else, oh, you know, they buy the assault weapon for, you know, hunting  or whatever, and then the first thing they do, any gun they have is they say 
[01:42:00]  what it would do to you if they shot you.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck a thing.  Take your whole fucking shoulder right off.  From here?  Back.  From here?  From here?  Forget about it.  Goes in like this, comes out your back like a fucking basketball.  Comes out cherry pie.  Anybody can blow anybody away.  Your head would go off like a melon.  I've never seen a head come apart like that.  Like that.  Shit. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  You want to hear the skirt story?  High school kid?  Yeah, skirt.  Where were we with this damn story?  I guess girls at this school can wear skirts.  Guys can't wear shorts.  So this guy thinks it's not fair, so he wants to now wear a skirt to school.  So some guy decides he's going to make a stand.  Because he hates pants.  Well, there's no skirting the issue for a high school boy in New Jersey.  Funny right away.  He will wear a skirt to class if he wants to.  17-year-old senior Mike Corbiello says that it's not about cross-dressing or making a fashion 
[01:43:00]  statement, it's to make a point.  At Hasbrook Heights High School, girls are allowed to wear skirts during the winter, but  the dress code does not allow boys to wear shorts.  He protested, calling the policy discriminatory and the school buckled.  Girls are allowed to wear skirts, and guys can't wear shorts.  You know, their legs are being exposed.  So that goes to show that it's not a cold thing.  The aspiring musician hates pants, and he's been wearing skirts to school since October. 
[01:43:30]  So the school ordered Corbiello to stop, but has now agreed to lighten up, as long as  the skirts are not too short.  And he can wear them, but he just still can't wear shorts.  But he can wear a skirt.  And as you were mentioning earlier, he had knee surgery, and he'd been wearing shorts.  He allowed him to, yeah.  Right.  To make that provision, and so.  Oh, right.  It's a medical reason.  He wears them fashionably with his gym shoes there, you know.  Good.  Only Steve Bartlestein would know that.  It's good that the school decided, you know something? 
[01:44:00]  All right, douchey.  Keep wearing your skirt.  No.  No shorts still, but yeah, you can wear a skirt.  Go ahead.  Now do that all fucking year.  What a bunch of pricks.  I love them.  Good.  He was like one of those, just those husky guys who were just always fucking hot.  You know, you go to like a fucking football game.  Yeah.  And you're sitting there fucking, like me, I'm always like freezing, and they're standing  there, I got like a fucking wife beater on.  If that.  Yeah, dude, I'm not even cold.  No shirt on with the team logo across your bellies. 
[01:44:30]  And it doesn't even affect them.  Oh, yeah, like those assholes will take their shirt off, and they got the...  Yeah, baby.  Let's go to Bruce.  Dude, there's no way we're not getting on TV.  Let's go to Bruce, Louisiana.  Losers.  Bruce!  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm fucking rolling, man.  I did this same thing when I worked at Walmart about four years ago.  You wore a skirt to Walmart?  I fucking wore it to work for about three days.  My wife took pictures and everything, and I'm not no fucking sissy. 
[01:45:00]  I'm 350 pounds, six foot tall.  Still be a sissy, sir.  On a movie I watched, Brokeback Mountain.  Wasn't like they were small gentlemen.  They let us wear fucking shorts and unload the trucks in the summertime, and it's like 110 degrees back there because they didn't have air conditioning in the warehouse part.  I'd rather be overheated than be called a faggot wearing a skirt.  Well, you know what?  It was funny, and I got laughs for about a week, but then the manager called me in the office and asked me what I was doing, and I said, well, it's either fucking discrimination or sexual harassment because it's either you don't want me to wear shorts or you just want to look at women's asses, and then I got fired. 
[01:45:30]  Well, yeah, because that last point didn't make any sense.  Well, yeah, it did because either they didn't want to see my fucking hairy legs or they wanted to go out of their way to fucking look at women's fucking asses is all there is to it.  Right.  How does that have to do with you wearing a skirt? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, that doesn't make sense.  No.  There's no sexual discrimination with the fact that you're wearing a dress.  Well, no, but that's been letting...  Well, that was a point you've been making for the last minute.  They said that, well, they said that you don't think women work as hard as you, and I was like, that's bullshit, man.  I'm fucking in the back of a truck all day unloading, you know?  Yeah.  Well, you should have studied harder in high school.  The world needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  I was fucking young, man. 
[01:46:30]  They got a video of...  Dude, I unloaded trucks.  I know how I did in high school.  They got a video.  I didn't study.  I got to interrupt.  I was young when I did it.  I'm fucking doing a lot better now.  They got a video of...  Yeah, what are you doing now?  Driving.  Of them loading Chris Penn's body into a truck.  Get out of here, really.  Into an ambulance or what have you.  Very creepy.  Oh, that's not true.  All right, Bruce, we're done with you.  Where can I email pictures to?  Ah, you can't.  Send us to www.sammonsc.com. 
[01:47:00]  Mike!  Yes?  Hey.  Hey.  That's a...  You know what's wrong with the kid in your story is he ain't got no friends.  We did that when I was in high school, but about 30 guys do it for a week.  The school buckles.  You had 30 guys wear skirts to school?  Yeah.  To make a point?  Yeah, they said no shorts.  It's, you know, same story.  No shorts.  Girls are wearing skirts.  Guys wear skirts for a week.  Shorts are allowed.  Yeah, that just doesn't make sense if you think about it. 
[01:47:30]  Girls are allowed to wear skirts.  Guys can't wear shorts?  Because they want them dressed up, I guess?  What if the shorts are nice shorts?  It's all about the principal and the instructor.  Of course you want the girls to have shirts.  You know what it's called?  It's called the goddamn dress code.  Yeah.  And it's school.  It's not a democracy when you're in school.  Everyone is high school.  I remember being in high school and thinking, man, you know, we need on-campus smoking.  Man, let's have a, you know, a smoking. 
[01:48:00]  We're going to hang out.  We're going to confront, like, the principal and tell him, we demand, like, a student smoking  lounge.  I want to be able to smoke in class, man.  Yeah.  So we're going to have, like, a sit-in, and we're just going to hang out here until someone  talks to us, man.  How old is he?  Oh, he's old.  Forget about it.  Did you have a bandana around your head?  No, and it's how ridiculous it was.  Is that freedom rock, man?  Right.  Turn it up.  Let your freak flag fly, man. 
[01:48:30]  You know how bad it was?  You want to blow off last period and see Thin Lizzy?  It wasn't even, like, the 60s when they did that.  It was, like, it was, like, the late 70s.  It wasn't even, like, I should have been involved in that.  Yeah.  But, you know, you do that, and then you get a couple of people together that agree  with you.  Yeah, man, we should be able to smoke, man.  This is, uh, quit hassling me, man.  And you all hang out.  I did my homework.  And then, like, not even the principal, some administrator comes over and goes, all right, 
[01:49:00]  if you don't get up and go to class, you're all just going to be suspended.  And then all the solidarity just goes out the fucking window, and everyone gets up  and starts leaving.  Yeah, well, we better just go to class, man.  It was actually called a walkout.  Yeah.  Did you ever do a walkout?  That was it.  A walkout.  At noon, we're all just going to walk.  Because we should be able to smoke, man.  No, you shouldn't.  Because the school says you can't.  Oh, well, they shouldn't.  You know something? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, they can.  They can do whatever they want.  Joey says I'm not getting to the point of the story.  Joey, Vegas.  Hey, what's up?  Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  It's just the point of either everybody does it or they don't.  You can't have it one way or the other.  You can't say, well, you can do this, but they can't do that.  You have to be in it all for not.  If everybody wants to be equal and have equal share, especially men and women, either everybody  wears pants or everybody wears short skirts and pants.  Why?  Because it's fair that way.  What's fair about it?  Who cares? 
[01:50:00]  Because if you have an establishment where you say, girls wear skirts, guys don't want  them wearing shorts.  That's the problem.  Joey's 21.  Aren't you, Joey?  You need life.  You need life to beat you a bit.  I bet you when you played sports, everyone got a trophy.  Right, Joey?  Nope.  How about some linen slacks?  What's wrong with linen slacks?  They're comfy.  They breathe.  You guys are missing the point, though.  I'm telling you I'm on to something.  He's 21, so everything has to be equal. 
[01:50:30]  That's how he was brought up.  And that's what's going to be the downfall of America.  It doesn't work like that, Pally.  Joey, everyone won a trophy when he was playing sports.  He probably played the safest sport, which was soccer, because everyone looks good, because  you don't know what the fuck's going on.  You just got to run around.  Just got to run around.  And that's his problem.  He has no idea that he sucks at a lot of things in life.  Joey, there was a time when there were...  He's got an award for everything he's ever done.  There was a time when there were winners and losers. 
[01:51:00]  You're speechless.  You don't know what a loser is.  When it was all about winning.  I want to know how the fuck this came to sports topic when we're talking about a fucking wardrobe.  Because you stink.  Because you're talking about how everything needs...  Sports are a metaphor for life.  No, let me explain, because he's calling me out.  Because you're trying to say that everything needs to be equal.  Yeah.  It doesn't need to be equal all the fucking time.  Sometimes it's just what it is.  Nothing more naive than a youngster saying, it's not fair. 
[01:51:30]  It's not fair.  Yeah.  Like, everything needs to be equal.  Everyone should be able to wear skirts or shorts.  Ugh.  Because they wear this, we should be able to.  That would be fair.  It's called life.  Does everybody live in the penthouse?  No.  And each year that ticks away off of your 21 years you have now, tick, tock, tick, tock.  More of a realization that life just ain't fair, my friend.  We're doing a disservice to the youth of America.  We really are.  Everyone wins. 
[01:52:00]  There's no losers.  That's one of the greatest lessons I ever learned in life was that I'm not special and life doesn't care if I lose.  Oh, absolutely.  You start, like, somewhere in my early 20s I still had that, like, ah, like I'm somehow protected from just bad shit happening.  From bad shit or failure or just a shit life.  Oh, yeah.  No, you're not protected.  It's like, no, you have to make the right decisions or you're fucked.  Right.  And you're already pretty far of a way through the point where you should have been making the right decisions. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, my dad taught me to work hard and to win and pretty much hinted that if you lose, it's not that good.  It's not fair.  It's not that good if you lose.  What was your dream, like, almost unattainable dream job of doing?  Was it radio?  No.  Actually, it was, you're going to laugh, to be in the NBA.  Okay.  And when did it hit you, realistically hit you, that, all right, this is never happening? 
[01:53:00]  When I was in high school and I wasn't growing.  I had all the skills in the world, but I was, like, I was just a little midget.  Yeah.  When it came to, you know, basketball.  Did you hang from the swing set?  Went to all the basketball camps.  I practiced on my own minimum five to six hours a day.  I was convinced I could make it in the NBA.  Yeah.  And then I just didn't get the height.  Jesus.  I was, like, 5'2", 91 pounds in 10th grade.  Then I was 5'6", and 11th.  And then finally I got up to about 5'10", 5'10 and a half as a senior. 
[01:53:30]  Not enough.  Not enough.  It was too late.  Bill, any dreams there that...  Like when you were a kid, younger, or a teen.  Oh, yeah.  They were all sports, yeah.  Were they sports?  I always wanted to be able to dunk a basketball.  I wanted to be, like, you know, 6'2", 6'3".  And it just never happened.  Yeah.  Just jumping my heart out, just barely hitting the net.  I was fucking over.  Oh, really?  I was almost able to dunk.  I could get up.  You could dunk.  What?  You could dunk.  Almost, yeah.  I want to see footage of that. 
[01:54:00]  I was over the rim.  The closer I ever came, I probably nicked the rim.  Yeah, but, dude, I'm almost 5'10".  If I was black, I'd be fucking reverse, just throwing it down.  I wasn't way over the rim.  I could easily, you know, slap the backboard and get rim.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, I had spring, man.  I worked on it.  Yeah, but you know what?  I worked on how to jump higher and all that now.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I dunked a volleyball.  It happened.  1985.  People know this show.  We're pretty fair with ourselves.  I'm telling you the truth.  I'm telling you the truth.  I could get up. 
[01:54:30]  What was your dream, man?  Astronaut?  Very close.  I wanted to be an F-16 pilot.  I wanted to be in the Air Force.  And each year that ticked away in high school, I saw some people that were like in, you know,  ROTC things and they were actually going through the motions that it took to get to some level of anything.  Right.  And I just wasn't doing it. 
[01:55:00]  But there was still like, all right, I still got time.  There's still time, you know.  And then you're like 18, 19.  It's like, all right.  There's still time.  No, there isn't.  And then you reach a point where you're like, now I'm just too old.  Yeah, that's not happening.  You can't even join anymore.  I just realized.  You can't even be the guy that turns a fucking screw on one of the planes.  Like, you're too old to even join for that.  And then you're just like, I really fucked my life up.  You know, I realized, I just realized I didn't have a lot of dreams as a kid. 
[01:55:30]  No.  I think I just wanted to get the fuck out of the house.  That was your dream?  Oh, yeah.  And any kid you talk to, what do you want to be when you grow up?  And it's always like, I want to be a major league baseball player.  Oh, yeah.  I want to be president of the United States.  You want to be president.  Well, you could be.  Just make sure you work hard in school.  Yeah.  No one says, I want to work in a cubicle in customer service.  Oh, if I could just have that fucking headset around my head. 
[01:56:00]  That's all I would want.  But all those little kids you talk to, astronaut, it's all those.  Because I want to be a sales rep at Radio Chat.  Right.  Oh, I know.  I wanted to be a football announcer.  Oh, really?  On Monday Night Football and get to go to all the stadiums.  I wanted to do all that shit.  I want to live in my parents' basement until I'm 30 and work at a deli.  And get busted for selling weed at 31.  Right. 
[01:56:30]  That's my dream.  Look at mom's heartbroken face as she's doling out bail money for you.  Because she realizes you're not going to make it.  And you're just starting to figure it out.  She's known for years.  That's horrible.  Hey, your parents know because they failed.  I'm telling you right now, you better study.  My mother's nightmare.  Because she was a cocktail waitress for years.  Did very well in nightclubs and stuff. 
[01:57:00]  She had the look.  She had a great personality and stuff.  And she would work at all these discos back in the 70s.  She still has the look, by the way.  Thank you, Opie.  You're welcome.  My mom is a doll.  But my uncle used to...  That's never a good compliment.  Not enough.  My uncle used to tease her all the time, like,  Ro, what's going to happen when you get a little older?  Are you going to be the waitress at the diner with the plates up your arms?  Like, walking to the table?  Just pounded her with that.  And that was, like, one of her biggest fears. 
[01:57:30]  And it was like, ah.  You know, she did a great job.  She raised three kids by herself.  So, but then there was, like, what do you do after that?  One arm twice the size of the other.  Yeah.  What do you have there, sweetie?  Right.  Writing down, you know.  All right.  You want the big breakfast?  I'm carrying the lumberjack, the French slam.  All the French slam.  You want two grand slams and eat some hash brown?  You know, that was her fucking nightmare.  Because when you're younger and you have the looks and you can pull off the cocktail waitress thing, 
[01:58:00]  you make a lot of money.  Yeah.  You can raise a family.  But there isn't an end game there to that.  There's, you know, there's that ends and then what?  And then what?  You know?  Wow, that breakfast thing, I just had a bad flashback to being on the road.  One of those moments where you're like, I'm really not going to make it.  I had done just some shitty fucking college gig.  I couldn't get to sleep.  I was in some shitty motel.  So I go to a Denny's and I'm just sitting there.  And it's me and one other guy in the Denny's. 
[01:58:30]  And the way they have a seat, we can actually see each other.  And that Paul McCartney song was on the, on the,  Somebody knocking on my door.  Somebody ringing the bell.  Give me a favor.  Open the door.  And it's literally like four in the morning.  We just kind of looked up and made eye contact.  And I was just bursted out laughing like, how did it come to this?  I want to hear your life story.  I want to know how you ended up here.  Because I'm going to tell you right now, it ain't working out for me either.  So I got all kinds of empathy, buddy. 
[01:59:00]  Let's hear it.  Oh, shit.  Let's fucking hear it.  Well, that's a moment, man.  It's called Let Him In, actually.  Oh, that is a moment.  Oh, my college, my college agent, I swear to God,  I would have a rider that would, basically simple,  a microstand, a stool, and a bottle of water.  That's all I needed.  And then I was like, stick me in a decent hotel that has lobby access only to the room.  And they would always fucking cross that out.  And they would stick me in a motel.  And I can't.  The doors are all on the outside of it, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  It's like the serial killer buffet.  Right.  They can just walk down.  I'm killing that guy.  I'm killing this guy.  I just, all right, 214, dead, 103, dead.  And you're guaranteed somebody staying there is running from the law.  You just look at the cars in the parking lot, and the Delta 88 rusted out fucking car, you  know it.  Yeah, because you're in your room, and you hear, you hear it pull up, the lights shine  under your wall as it goes through your window.  Yeah, you hear the conversation. 
[02:00:00]  Did they get the plate?  Change the plates.  In the trunk.  Rope.  Let's go to George in Jersey.  Georgie.  Morning, boys.  Morning, George.  I got a 19-year-old son who has been spoon-fed entitlement all through his school life, and  it drives me nuts.  Yeah, they're teaching the wrong shit in class.  That everyone's an equal, and we're all equals, and there's no losers.  There's no winners. 
[02:00:30]  You should have...  I have...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I've spent the last five years working on my younger kids, crushing their hopes so that  they'll be able to get through life.  So your son thinks everything should be equal?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, we fight all the time about, you know, there should be gas, you know, there should  be solar-powered cars, and everyone should get equal pay, and it should be just this wonderful  world we live in, and I can't figure out where he got it, because I'm the most cynical  prick there is.  God, you're bringing up a liberal. 
[02:01:00]  You know what?  He's not mine.  He must belong to his mother.  You don't have to crush their dreams.  You just have to teach them that everybody is going to try to crush your dream, and you  have to, like, plow through it.  Dude, even today, I ran into a guy.  I was doing some gig in Atlanta, and he goes to me, he goes, yeah, hey, I saw your HBO  special.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  He goes, yeah, man, you look nervous.  And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, no, man, I was actually, no, that was one of the greatest 
[02:01:30]  nights of my life.  You asshole.  He goes, yeah, no, but you look nervous.  I'm like, dude, that's like the only time I've ever done a TV taping where I walked away  with no regrets whatsoever, 100% on.  I felt great about it.  Let me go on the record, too.  Thank you.  You didn't look nervous at all.  Yeah, but you look nervous.  And I, and for some reason, I'm being a nice guy.  I should have been like.  Doesn't this idiot understand, like, he's insulting you?  But this is the point, though, is that that's the, the old, like, years ago when I came out 
[02:02:00]  of the fucking, I had no idea, and I'd be like, oh, fuck, I did look nervous.  And I would just fuck with my head.  Yeah.  For like, like, like days on end.  So when I'm like, this dude here, you don't crush their dreams, you just teach them that  that's what people are going to do.  Yeah, other people are going to try to just crush your dreams.  I remember when I first got into this business, I was, I was going to do radio.  I was doing it in college.  I remember the fucking guy at the meat store, my mother tells it to the guy, I'm like,  ah, fuck, here it comes.  He goes, I don't know, it's tough business.  Everyone wants to be the star. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, always.  Yeah, the guy at the meat store.  Great, maybe I'll fucking cut up some pork chops and just fucking hang out with you with a  bloody apron all.  That was the deal with being in a band, too, for so many years.  You'd hear from everybody.  You know, I was eking out a living, my brother eking out a living, just enough money to party  on the weekends and maybe eat during the week and dodge the landlord for another couple of  weeks for the rent.  But, you know.  Sounds like a George Thurgood video.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da. 
[02:03:00]  But it was.  One bourbon, one scotch, one dog in the landlord.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da.  But the dream was, hey, we got a good band, man.  We're going to, you know, do something with this.  We got to get ourselves a record deal and we're going to go on tour and this is what we're  going to do with our lives.  But at every turn, no matter who you spoke to, it was always, you know how many people  are out there trying and, you know, just doesn't work and how hard it is. 
[02:03:30]  You got to know somebody and this to every turn.  Because they were afraid.  One person that would actually give you that, hey, man, good luck.  Yeah, because they're afraid that you're going to make.  See, I don't begrudge anybody who makes it like they're money because there are people  like, oh, you're fucking celebrities and all this shit.  It's like, dude, you got to understand.  He took all his chips and put it on the fucking 2000 to one shot.  Yeah.  All right, you fucking bet on like the, you know, the eight to one.  So all those fucking guys, you know, you guys I know moved out to fucking L.A. and just 
[02:04:00]  getting crushed out there.  I have people like giving me, not shit, but like, you know, hey, I'm going to Boston to  do a radio with Opie from WBAB.  I'm doing, oh, yeah, what about your job?  Oh, I'm leaving my fucking tin knocking job.  And yeah, that was it.  Oh, man.  You did the exact thing.  That first thing is like that, like, I don't want to say this, but I'm going to, uh, you  know, you got some years vested over there.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Uh, you leave, you know, I don't know, you can be able to come back and get it's fucking  sheet metal work.  Believe me, I can come back.  I can come back.  What is this gap in your resume, Anthony?  Can you explain this?  You left for a year.  A lot has happened in the sheet metal business over the back.  It's the same business it was in 1890.  And well, this year we came up with a new thing.  It's that we don't use tin anymore and you know nothing about it. 
[02:05:00]  And I'm sorry you're not.  My mom told me very early on, she goes, don't let the bastards get you down.  Never forgot it.  I was.  There's plenty of them out there.  I was, I was, I was like eight.  Was your mom Patton?  I know.  But it's something like.  And don't let the bastards get you down.  Now go out there and kill those Nazis.  But I, you know, I mean it was something she said when I was really young and I never  forgot and I always kept that in the back of my head because there's always buzz kills  out there.  Always buzz kills.  I lost a really good friend because of this radio show actually.  A really good friend. 
[02:05:30]  I was going over to his house for a, I was going over to his house for a barbecue and  stuff and you know, he, I mean we were really close and broke back close.  And he was listening to, and he was a fan of the show, you know.  Yeah.  He knew about this dream way before it happened and all that.  So, so, so we go back, you know, and he's talking about the radio show and he goes when,  he goes while I'm over there, he says, hey, that Anthony's a really funny guy. 
[02:06:00]  I'm like, yeah, he really is, you know.  He goes, why does he need you?  My best, like literally at the time.  Jesus.  He was my best friend.  And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  My mother doesn't even say that.  Jesus Christ.  I'm like, man, why are you so bitter?  You know, because he took the safe route.  You talk about, you know, there were guys in high school that took the safe route.  He was one of the guys that took the safe route.  You know, he, I don't want to blow up his spot, but it's like, this is the career path  you go because you make a good, a good salary right out of college. 
[02:06:30]  A good wage.  A good wage.  You got to call it.  I make a good wage.  And there's, and it's a very popular, you know, popular profession.  So there's a lot of jobs out there.  And I was like, well, fuck that.  Man, I'm taking, like Bill said, I'm going to take this radio chance.  Fuck me.  Yeah.  Because I'll be a happier person if I hit.  So he goes, you know, why does Anthony need you?  He's so funny.  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  Jesus.  You know, besides the fact that I don't have to prove it to anybody.  I had a successful career before Anthony and I hooked up. 
[02:07:00]  And then.  He doesn't post on Wackbag, does he?  No kidding.  And then through the rest of the barbecue, he's mentioning specific things about our show.  And if any, the hardcore listeners understand what each piece, each person brings to the show.  Right.  That was a prime example yesterday.  On this particular day, he just happens to be bringing up certain bits that were all me.  All me.  We never played that game.  And I'm not even going to tell you which ones.  But they were, he was mentioning these things he heard recently, like, oh, when you guys did so and so. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, my God.  So I just sit there.  Oh, yeah, that was mine.  And then by the end of the barbecue, he got it.  Because then he came up to me and apologized.  Because it was like one after another.  Oh, that was mine, too.  Oh, yeah, that was something I came up with when I was driving to work one day.  Yeah, you know something?  And then I was like, dude, what the fuck?  You're a dick.  And then I could not hang out with the guy anymore.  And we were so fucking close.  Who is he and what's his number?  I'm firing him off an email.  No, but that's when you have, like.  Dear ex-best friend, you don't know shit about how a radio show works. 
[02:08:00]  It's angry typing guy, people.  Angry typing guy.  Thank you.  See?  Thank you.  See?  I bring that to the show.  Lucky me.  Yeah, but you know what's funny?  What's funny about taking this route, though, I can't tell you how many times, though,  when this business just kicks you in the balls and you're on the road and you just walk by a food court  and you just see a happy family just going, you know, I should have fucking done that.  That was a road, huh?  I should have just fucking worked at a hardware store in there. 
[02:08:30]  I'll take it even further.  I mean, Anthony and I, I can speak for us.  We're very humble, you know.  We appreciate what we got and stuff.  And we've been very successful at radio.  Getting into this, I had no idea how jealous people that you felt were close to you would get because of your success.  I have family members, not in my, you know, brothers and sisters, but I'm talking, let's just say maybe some cousins or an aunt or maybe an uncle 
[02:09:00]  that are just, like, not happy for me because of how, like, there's a weird jealousy thing or something.  Yeah, you can't hold it.  And I go to some of these family parties.  I'm like, chill, dude.  I'm not rubbing it in your face.  Those guys are hilarious.  I got this one guy, he's got a bar, right, and I never go to him.  Like, once every couple of years, I'll go into it.  And he's just one of these dudes where he was the man in high school, and I was, you know, obviously the fucking redhead geek, right?  So I come in there. 
[02:09:30]  Every time I go in there, I just try to be, hey, man, what's going on?  And he always got to fucking slam me.  Still give you a shit.  Somehow.  He goes, yeah, you haven't been in for a couple of years.  And I go, oh, you know, I was doing this comedy tour.  And he goes, ooh, big shot.  Oh, God, I get that all the time.  Oh, hey, big shot, no time, huh?  Yeah, it's just like, I'm sorry.  My life has worked out to this point.  Yeah, I apologize for my success.  For all I know, this is as far as I'm going to go.  And I'll be working funny bones when I'm 60. 
[02:10:00]  Do you realize that could fucking happen, you know?  Yeah.  Do you feel yourself, like, downplaying your success in front of people that you know just don't know how to take it?  No, there aren't too many.  There aren't too many, but plus I also feel like, you know, I started with fucking Dane Cook.  So, I mean, he's playing, like, the fucking Worcester Centrum in the Boston Garden.  That's why I downplay it, because I don't take it for granted.  So, as far as looking at yourself, like, I'm successful.  I've downplayed some of our appearances on TV and stuff. 
[02:10:30]  Like, last year, we were part of the, technically, we were part of the pregame show for the Super Bowl.  And just like you, you know, oh, wow, you're on that Super Bowl, you know, pregame.  I'm like, yeah, but it was, like, real early.  It was, like, I don't know, four hours before the game.  It was no big deal.  No one really saw it.  You know, you end up downplaying your own success.  Hey, big shot.  I do that, and it's not because I'm trying to be humble.  It's because I'm trying to avoid them trashing me and getting in my head, like,  dude, I saw you on, what was with that shirt? 
[02:11:00]  And then just fucking replays in your head from the next part.  What was with that shirt?  Everyone was thinking that.  Spielberg was watching it.  I'll never get a movie, because I had a long shirt on.  I've learned you can't wear anything that people are going to like.  Clothing is just a completely different animal.  Whatever you're wearing on television, people will goof on you about it.  Nice jacket, dick.  Well, did shirt, Jesus Christ, did it come with a cock?  Yeah, it came with a cock. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, but that's, like, more, that's more fun.  I know.  Like, everyone does that to each other.  I'm talking about, like, you know, the whole, how they handle the success is just so strange to me.  Yeah, but you can't hold it against them.  I mean, really.  Think about it.  It isn't fun to have to look at somebody that's kind of doing well when you're miserable every fucking day of your life.  What are you supposed to do?  Walk up to them.  Hey, dude, man, I am so happy for you.  Even though my life stinks on ice, I just want to tell you I am so happy. 
[02:12:00]  But you're not asking for that.  I downplay it.  I just never, just to sum it up, I never expected, you know, family members and friends to have that jealousy.  Little reality.  There you go.  Let's go to Gary.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Just wanted to brief you guys on the reality of what's really going on out there.  Whoever said that the soccer, I think it was Bill who said the soccer was playing for a bunch of shitty kids that's not very good at athletics 
[02:12:30]  because no one knows what the hell they're doing is absolutely correct.  Like, these days, people, absolutely, they don't keep score.  I was reading, I've got to interrupt you because I've got to find this.  Maybe one of the listeners can.  And I forgot the name of the fucking book.  It was a book on pop culture.  This guy, I think he writes for Blender Magazine, too.  He wrote a chapter on soccer that is just brilliant and explained why soccer is such a huge sport now.  It had something to do, like you're saying, like the kids just get out there, run around.  You don't really know what's going on.  So no one is like, you know. 
[02:13:00]  You don't have to catch anything.  Well, and it's hard to say, wow, he's the star of the baseball.  Look, that guy, like they're all just equal out there doing their little jobs, working together,  and no one steps up as the real star of the team.  Yeah.  I've got to find it and read it for everybody on the air because it's just brilliant.  But anyway, go ahead, Gary.  Well, they make â€“ there are no losers in the entire league.  Now, I played college football, and now my son wants me to coach his soccer team, 
[02:13:30]  and I refuse to because I'm too competitive, and I just make sure that, you know,  the kids know that there is a winner, there is a loser, and life's going to be that way,  that they have to deal with it.  Yeah, I hear, like, they don't even keep score.  Yeah, you know what's funny in some of these competitions now?  They don't keep score.  That would entice somebody to say, hey, we won and you guys lost.  Right.  That's why baseball is, like, the most humiliating sport because every play,  it's so fucking individual.  Like, you're at bat, and everybody is just watching you. 
[02:14:00]  It's not like, you know, your teammate threw the ball.  You know what I mean?  You just go up to bat.  You're just fucking standing there.  Strike one.  You're like, fuck.  Strike two.  God damn it.  You can't get any help from anyone else.  Oh, it's brutal.  And then even if the ball gets hit to you, if you miss it, it's just â€“  You know, you're just so fucking â€“  I have, like, this â€“  You're an individual.  Yeah.  I've played a lot of sports, but Little League, I just stunk.  I could not get in the batter's box and calm the fuck down. 
[02:14:30]  I was convinced I was going to get hit every time.  And way years later when I got older, I still thought about the fear I had in the batter's box with the ball coming in.  Well, I don't know how people stand in that.  Yeah, but here's the deal.  I think I was maybe 10, 11, okay?  And now I got nephews and nieces and stuff around that age, and they're now playing Little League.  And you â€“ I've gone to a few of these games, and I'm like, that's what I was scared of as a kid?  The ball's barely being thrown in.  But as a little kid, I'm thinking it's like Roger Clemens throwing a heater at your head. 
[02:15:00]  But it's like, that's what I was scared of?  Looking back, you're like, that's what I was scared about?  Are you kidding?  I sucked.  I could always catch it, but I just completely lacked speed.  Really?  Bat speed, foot speed.  I just didn't have it.  Umpire, every time, get closer to the plate, I'm like, do I have to?  I'm such a wimp.  I'm such a wimp on the baseball field.  Dude, all I got my whole Little League career was singles. 
[02:15:30]  And then we went to the championship for the pennant, and I must have swung late because  it went right down the right field line, you know, with the shittiest kids playing.  I ended up getting a fucking triple out of it.  Now I was just like â€“ then the next time â€“ I had like nine more at-bats for the rest  of the season, and I struck out nine times on 27 pitches.  I fucking went â€“ I would get up there, strike one, two, three.  I was just swinging.  I was the most automatic fucking out â€“ oh, my coach. 
[02:16:00]  Easy out, easy out.  Oh, my God.  I bet you can't yell that shit anymore, can you?  Probably not.  No, of course not.  Listen to this one.  Tom, Connecticut.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  My daughter's soccer league, she's 10 years old.  And if her team creams another team, if they get up by like seven points, her team loses  the game, if they just squash them, it's ridiculous.  If it's a blowout, the team that blew out the other team loses because they â€“ if you're 
[02:16:30]  up by seven, so then â€“ oh, yeah.  So then you can't score anymore?  You can't score anymore.  It happened twice last year, and the coach had to take like two players off of her team.  Right.  So they played like an 11 against nine.  I'd be the guy scoring the goal that puts us up by seven every time, like, oh, I guess  we lose.  Oh, we lose.  Too many points.  We lose.  We lose.  I'm going to bow my head in shame now.  Wow.  We walk off the field because we lost. 
[02:17:00]  They get penalized for success.  God, it's so â€“ where did this mentality start?  Can you imagine what â€“  It's all in the schools.  It's in the soccer leagues and the little league and all that crap.  Can you imagine Kobe Bryant if he had that fucking attitude?  Yeah.  Imagine 81 points and you lose that night.  81 points.  Too many points.  Too many points.  You'll lose.  That's it.  It started because parents of children that weren't really achievers started feeling poorly  for their kids and started speaking up. 
[02:17:30]  Get them an instrument.  And all the psychobabble they heard from shrinks and everything else said this isn't healthy  as they're growing up.  And that's bullshit.  Of course it is.  Because what fuels your drive is shit that all happened to you as a kid that you hold  on to.  That anger.  It's like that â€“ what is that?  Red Dawn.  Keeps me warm.  Yeah.  All that anger is going to burn you up.  Keeps me warm.  Keeps me warm. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, some of the shit.  To this day I'll be doing a road gig yelling at my windshield at like my third grade teacher  for some shit that she said to me.  Just a complete psychopath.  Yeah.  There's stuff back then.  Losses that you took that were just devastating.  Yeah.  That's shit that people said.  Yeah.  Let's go to Lionheart in Jersey.  Lionheart.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  What's up, Bill?  What's going on?  It was reminding me before we were talking about people trying to crush your dreams and  then reacting to your success.  I had a real good friend of mine.  I'm a rapper out of New Jersey. 
[02:18:30]  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  You're a guy from New Jersey who thinks he can rap.  See?  He's doing it right now, man.  Don't let him crush your dreams.  I'm crushing your dreams.  Look at you.  Let me hear you.  Throw out a little rhyme.  Throw a little something, something.  All right.  My name is the Lionheart.  You know that you know it.  You better liquefy your spot before I blow it.  You think I'm scared of you?  You don't know what I'm prepared to do?  I'll introduce you to the business end of these pair of boots.  I'm bearable.  I throw weight on shoulders like Atlas.  You spit more drama than a soap opera actress. 
[02:19:00]  I'm on the blacklist for being too white.  The stars is the only act you'll be seeing tonight.  Tweety birds and Flintstone bumps get gold out.  When my giant animaniac's hammer gets pulled out,  I'll leave no doubt about my ridiculous rhyme.  A jumble of words from my meticulous mind.  I'm sicker with mine than any five other emcees.  My lines keep smothering me, asphyxiating on this lyrical sedative.  Okay, enough, enough, enough, enough.  All right.  That.  I'm always ready.  Was the worst rapping I've ever heard in my life. 
[02:19:30]  It's also the first rap you've ever heard, Anthony.  You're not a big fan of it.  There you go.  All right, Lionheart.  What's your story?  Well, the first show I ever did was in 99.  It was a friggin' open mic in New Brunswick.  I bring my best friend down.  I figure he could support me.  You know, it's my first show.  And like 15 minutes before, it was fine up until then,  but like 15 minutes before the show, he starts flipping out.  I'm fine.  And he's like, oh, don't go up there.  Don't go.  They're going to laugh at you.  Dude, don't go up there. 
[02:20:00]  They're going to laugh at you.  And I'm like, dude, you're not helping me.  And then afterwards, it was all fine.  And like, you know.  And this eight mile.  Yeah.  It's hard to like.  So I felt like selling, you know, records.  And like two years later, you know, I'm doing like, I'm on my third album.  I'm selling records, you know, and doing well.  And he's like, you know, I was always there for you.  You got to remember.  Yeah.  Then you get those guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like, dude, if I listened to you, I would be fucking working at Wendy's or Klaus.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  You only got one shot.  Lionheart's song right here.  Right.  One opportunity.  So if you want to rap, perhaps you should rap your head in saran wrap, sir.  All right, Lionheart.  Strangle yourself.  All right.  We got another great one.  Joe and Glendale.  Joe.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I coach basketball in Queens, but I was talking to a buddy of mine who is in the, who coaches  in Glen Cove, and they max every player out at 16 points.  So after 16 points, the kids now have to score anymore. 
[02:21:00]  Holy shit.  What is going on?  We are raising a bunch of pussies.  No competition.  They don't want them competing.  Right.  They have to pass the ball off.  They can't score anymore.  They don't want standout stars.  They don't want people to show that they have more talent than anybody else.  What about that great moment in every game of the final nail in the coffin, that Larry  Bird three?  It just launches.  At the buzzer. 
[02:21:30]  Well, even when I coach in Queens, you're allowed to press, but if you're up by 15 points,  you have to take the press off, and you can't go outside the three-point line on defense.  Somehow, I'm guessing they're not doing this up in Harlem.  Maybe that's why white athletes are getting the shit kicked out of them.  Yeah.  We played against the black team that we were actually beating, but we couldn't beat them  like when we used to lose by 50 when I was 12.  Hey, I got a message for the next generation.  Have fun with China.  We'll be long gone. 
[02:22:00]  Enjoy that little battle.  All right.  You guys suck.  I'm out.  China's coming.  They're coming on strong.  Yeah.  China is coming our way.  You keep raising your pussies out there.  They go to school like six days a week.  Those kids don't even sleep.  They don't win.  They get beat up.  That's why their eyes are all squinty.  They're so fucking tired.  They're so fucking tired.  They want to rule the world.  We don't.  We just want everyone to be equal.  Yeah, everyone's got to be equal. 
[02:22:30]  Let's go to Colorado.  Heather, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, good.  I think it's the parents' fault for them playing pussy leagues like that.  There's always better places you can let your kids play.  My kids play soccer, and I totally disagree with your description of soccer.  But it's because I found the league that has the values of competition and dedication.  We don't play the bullshit games these guys are talking about.  Well, I respect that from you.  I personally don't like soccer.  I never really got the soccer thing myself. 
[02:23:00]  I don't like soccer either.  Hey, this just in.  We're having too good of a radio show, so we're going to give the other radio show hosts out there a chance.  So we're going to now simulcast the David Lee Roth show.  Wow.  Nice.  We're killing the competition today.  We've got to back off a little.  We've got to pull it back a little.  We're going to pull it back.  We've all scored our 16 points.  We've done enough.  David Lee Roth is...  We're going to undo the mousetraps.  That fits over.  Yeah, David Lee Roth is 0 for 18, so we've got to step off the court and simulcast the show to give him a little chance. 
[02:23:30]  And now a little bozy, bozy bop for you.  A little bozy, bozy bop from the biggest failure in radio history.  Bozy, bozy bop.  City bop.  You know, we're getting a lot of requests for the David Lee Roth song.  We should play it.  Yeah.  Quick setup.  That was good.  You're lucky enough not to have David Lee Roth in your town.  David Lee Roth took over for Howard in a bunch of markets, especially here in New York City. 
[02:24:00]  Most on the East Coast.  And his show is a complete disaster.  They're writing about it.  Now they're just trying to figure out when he's going to be off the air.  Yeah, they're kind of trying to make it seem like he's difficult to work with.  And he's pulling some shenanigans over there at K-Rock, acting crazy, not showing up for things.  And that is a prelude to getting rid of somebody.  Yeah.  That's what they do.  When they want to keep somebody, they go, wow, he's a great guy. 
[02:24:30]  We're looking to the future.  We're just trying to, you know.  Building the audience.  Yeah, we've got to purge the audience that was there.  There's going to be some negative response.  We understand that.  But we're very confident.  No.  A few weeks in, we've got this guy's a fucking lunatic.  He's moving plants around the place.  He's moving plants.  And that's crazy.  There's something about looking for asbestos.  Yeah.  He's afraid of the asbestos in the building.  There hasn't been asbestos here since 1912. 
[02:25:00]  You know, they redesigned the back story.  They redesigned a studio for him.  And he's like, I can't use that.  There's asbestos in there.  After they spent, like, a ton of money to redesign a studio for him.  And then he's allergic to dust.  Yeah, they're not going to use asbestos to stay in age, are they?  No.  They're on in the next thing that we're not aware of.  If they built, what they did was they built Howard's studio over there.  And when they built that, they would have had to have removed all the asbestos from that.  Right.  So when they tear it down to build David Lee Roth's studio, the asbestos is gone. 
[02:25:30]  You get a lot of dust and stuff.  But I'm sure he's not in there while they're pulling insulation out of the ceiling.  Yeah.  So he's losing his mind.  Yeah.  They're not happy that they hired David Lee Roth.  It's just a matter of time before they kick him off the air.  He's off the buses now, huh?  I haven't seen him on the buses.  They've already taken that off?  Yikes.  He wants to walk away and they'll pay out his contract because that's what Infinity does.  There's so many people on the payroll that haven't worked in the last two, three years for Infinity Broadcasting. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  They fire people and just pay out your contract.  It's the best gig in radio to get hired by Infinity.  Joel, Bob Eatman.  That's it.  Just give him a call.  Give him a call.  We're ready, Bob.  You know you're ready.  You know you're ready, Bob.  Aren't you?  Aren't you, Bob?  Wait.  Joel.  Joel.  Ah, motherfucker.  Oh.  Oh, that one hurt.  All right.  I know that one hurt because it had half your knuckle and the bone in the top of your hand. 
[02:26:30]  Damn it.  That's my...  I wrecked my own bit.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be Joel.  You're ready, Joel, aren't you?  Oh, well.  Aren't you?  No, it's your story.  Just pick up the phone, Joel.  Aren't you, Joel?  I fucked up the whole bit.  All right.  Let's play the Dave Lee Roth parody song from Voss's friend Dave in Jersey.  I'm in a studio on the radio Who cares what the hell I'm saying 
[02:27:00]  I'm taking a chance without my spandex pants And the baldness I'm displaying  Every single day I'll turn fans away Then who's gonna listen to me  When the end comes, I know I'll have done a month of shows Then they'll bring in Sammy 
[02:27:30]  Hagar I ain't got no talent Nobody, nobody cares for me  My shtick is so hokey I am such a phony  Such a phony, such a phony Why would somebody go and take a chance on me? 
[02:28:00]  I guess things are bad Waking up with me, babe  I play Van Halen songs All of the time  Eddie, fire me, my pal Eddie, fire me Flop, my show's gonna flop  I'll get dropped I ain't got no talent Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody cares for me

[02:29:00]  My shtick is so hokey I am such a phony  I'm a phony, such a phony Why would somebody go and take a chance on me?  I guess things are bad Waking up with me, babe  I play Van Halen songs All of the time 
[02:29:30]  Eddie fired me, my pal Eddie fired me  There you have it, man. That's a great job. That's a great song parody right there.  Trainwreck Radio with David Leroy  Yeah, good luck over there to you, Dave. Good luck  David from Jersey sent that in. Voss' friend. We love playing that  We just talk about all that and then we just turned around and bash the shit out of somebody that's trying to make something work for himself 
[02:30:00]  Everybody does it. Of course  Matt from West Virginia  It's a point. It's part of the competition  Right  Hey, guys. How you doing this morning?  Hey, man  Hey, we just got a... I coached my son's basketball team  And we just had a big conference before our first game that the kids aren't allowed to have but no more than five fast breaks  We don't need to worry about who wins or loses  Anything like that. And all they want to do is try to teach them how to play 
[02:30:30]  But you can't teach them how to play if they don't win or lose  Yep, I agree  I mean, if you take your fast breaks away, what do you got? Nothing  I'm starting to think that the listeners are making up these basketball rules now  You think so?  I coach in a basketball league where they actually told us we're only allowed one black kid per team  My son plays checkers. He's not allowed to jump anybody  All you can do is just push them into each other  And you end the game with just as many checkers as you started with 
[02:31:00]  There you go. Mom will punch out  All right  I see  Some of these rules are getting a little fishy with the...  Yeah  Coach team we play, there ain't no baskets on the court  Right  There's no scoring either way. They just bounce, dribble the ball  They all get a ball and they just run around  They just run around  Danny in Indiana  Hey, it's Jamie  Hi, Jamie  All right, whatever  Yeah, you know  But anyways, I was in high school, played high school baseball  I was one for eleven my entire career 
[02:31:30]  Got a hit on senior night  Home run  You fucker  What?  It's your terrible story  Was that him like trying to relive the moment?  Yeah, he was just bragging  Wow, that's all  Is there any high school moment?  Because I know, I've been in local bars where you walk in and you see that guy that was on the football team in high school and he still wears the jacket  Can't button it anymore 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, just a mess  Or you see him, there was one guy and he was the big jock in high school and I was pulling my truck into a car wash and he was taking my ticket and saying, what do you want?  I'm like, oh, I'll have the supreme  Oh  You know, and I looked at him and I was like, that's the guy, holy shit, he's the guy that was the guy in high school  And he wasn't even like, it wasn't even like, he owned the place 
[02:32:30]  The Brad Pitt of your high school  Yeah, yeah  He's like fucking famous  Yeah, famous in high school  Yeah, that was it  He had a division three school that was looking at him  Oh, like, dude  And he bragged about it to everybody  Couldn't compete at that level  We used to look, and we used to look at the  Fucked up my shoulder  Right, yeah, that's what happened  Blow out a knee  The cheerleaders were all over this guy  And we used to look at the cheerleaders like it was a crime  Like we were peeping Toms that could be arrested for looking at them 
[02:33:00]  That's how, like, low on the totem pole me and my friends were  We were the pot-smoking army jacket guys  Like, no matter, every day it was the same thing  Jeans, a t-shirt, and an army jacket  And we just kind of, like, messed up hair  Walking around stoned all the time  The burnouts  The burnouts  We used to be part of a group  I was in that fucking, just generic drones  Like, you weren't popular, but you weren't like a total fucking nerd 
[02:33:30]  You weren't a burnout  Yeah  You were just that fucking, just Levi's in a flannel  You just blend in  You're like the background guy  You're like the audience member to cheer on at the football game  That's all you were, just like, background  I was an extra in high school  But you could probably, like, I knew I could  I had some crossover potential because I was funny  And that kind of works  That goes a long way, especially in high school  But, no, I was part of the burnout crew  And this guy was like, you know, all the cheerleaders 
[02:34:00]  And we used to, me and Joe Curry and stuff  Used to, like, peek around the corner and watch cheerleader practice  And we were just in love with these girls  And this guy's just, yeah, whatever, bitch, you know  Yeah, I'll see you later  Fuck you  And there I was  I pull up and I'm following him like fucking little ducks  Yeah  Exactly  That's all cute  And he takes my little ticket at the car wash  And it wasn't even like he was the guy that owns  Because if he owned the car wash, that would still be okay  Alright, you're the owner 
[02:34:30]  You're just, you know, putting in some sweat equity today  No, he was just the guy that kind of  Alright, give him the number three  It's like, oof, how the mighty have fallen  And I wonder, because I didn't say anything  But I wonder if he even recognized me  Because I was such a non-entity to those people  You know, like, oh, weren't you the burnout guy?  They didn't recognize people like you  They don't remember  It was about them, the rest of the team  And the cheerleaders  And the cheerleaders  Right  Alright, let's go to Matt in Florida 
[02:35:00]  Matt  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey  I just wanted to comment about the whole equality thing  You know, you mentioned the Chinese earlier  They have it, they call it communism  Yeah  And if you think we're going to let the goddamn commies  I get your point, sir  Alright, see ya  Communism is all equal  Let's go to Tim in Long Beach  Tim  Hey, guys, I love the show, Bill, you're great  I just want to say, the reason this is the dweebs  Their prophecy is coming true

Everyone's got  I'm doing a show  Now we've got a trash history  You're never going to make it, kid  No  Yeah, exactly, yeah  It's hard to get through to you guys  As long as I've gotten through  I want to just get a quick plug-in  So then there'll be a whole thing  On Wackback thread, I'm sure  Saying how much I stink  And rip you guys off  Ma!  Ma, please stop calling me  I'm trying to do my radio show 
[02:36:30]  Ma!  Ma!  I'm not going to order  I have to do this now  I see the awful, terrible things in my life  And turn it into something funny  That's terrific  That's terrific  There's a podcast in the basement  Do you have cardboard cutouts of celebrities in a set?  There's a little Photoshop picture of me with you guys  Yeah, we're all just hanging out 
[02:37:00]  Doing our radio show together  Put your hand around the back of our cardboard head  And tap our head  That's really funny  Alright, well good luck to you, Tim  Thanks a lot, guys  A lot of people doing the podcast now  There are a few celebrities now popping up because of this  Little podcast celebrities  We've got to start playing some of the podcasts  Yeah  What exactly is that for the technically challenge?  What you do is you get a camera  The video camera  Because it's all video podcasts now  The audio podcasts are a thing of the past  That's nothing  So you get a video camera  You get a room 
[02:37:30]  And you get a buddy  And some alcohol or something  I don't know  You can do anything  You can just tape it  Whatever content it is  Then you put it up on the internet  In downloadable form for the iPods  So then people can then listen  And watch you on their iPod  After they download it  And they download a little show  Some of them are just five minutes  I know there's one show  It was this guy  It's got volumes of five minute little helpers  For Photoshop  So if you're into doing Photoshop  He gives you little pointers and tips 
[02:38:00]  On using the Photoshop program  And then there was one I watched the other day  It was kind of funny  It was these two guys  That do tech talk  With laptops on their lap  On a couch  In someone's house  But they drink during the whole thing  So as it's going on  They're getting more drunk  And more drunk  And that was kind of funny  And there's just  I mean thousands of these things out there  Most of them just suck  It's something you want to look out for ten minutes  But occasionally  You get a gem  You get something funny  Well there's a business there  Someone to go through all the podcasts 
[02:38:30]  And really just get the better ones  And throw them up on a site  Mark in South Carolina  What's up?  Hey what's up fellas  Hey  I'm a teacher  And this goes to show  Why we're last in the country  But if a kid fails a test  Or homework  Or what not  We've got to give them  Repeated chances  To make it up  Or to pass  And basically  We're not allowed to give them  Anything less than a low D  On their report card  So no one fails  Say again?  No one fails  It's just low D's?  Pretty much  If we fail 
[02:39:00]  And then we have to deal with the parents  And go through all this red tape  And it's like  Why fail them  And have to deal with all that  It used to be  Mr. and Mrs. Johnson  Your son is dumb  Is an idiot  And if you failed  And I can just see parents like this these days  When you fail your child  When your child fails  You run to the school  And try to get an excuse  As to why the teacher is such an idiot  To have failed your child  Instead of doing  What the old school parents did  The palm of the hand  To the back of your head 
[02:39:30]  Oh yeah  What are you a fucking idiot?  My baseball career ended  Because of a D in math  A D in math  And that was it  Pulled off the team  Like that's it  Get your shit together  Get your grades up  My dad had this  One for all  And all for one  So he took all the kids  Off the baseball team  So all my brothers hated me  And my older brother's team  That's the marine fucking rules  My older brother's team  Won the world series that year  And he still brings this shit up  Wow  Fucking douchebag  Getting a fucking  D in fifth grade math 
[02:40:00]  Your brother Bill  Is not performing up to the standards  Of this family  What is that in your locker?  You will all suffer  For not supporting him  Like you should have  Can't eat it pile  They're paying for it  Did they come into your room  And beat you with soap?  Dude fuck my brother  In socks  Alright  I'm gonna tell you why  Cause he flunked the third grade  And had to stay back  And because he had  The whole third grade?  The whole fucking grade  He flunked it  How do you flunk third grade?  Wow that is tough 
[02:40:30]  This is the best thing  That's like advanced finger painting  Isn't it?  He flunks the thing  And because he flunks it  And he has to stay back  All of us have to stay back  What are you talking about?

[02:41:30]  When he got left back  You're all staying back  Then he called up  And he said  I want to hold all these kids back  I think it's better for him  And the school said  Okay  Yeah  Wow  I would hate my brother  Wow  Yeah and he's bitching  Because he didn't get  Some fucking trophy  On some team  He probably sucked on anyways  Wait a minute  He failed  Third grade  So you had to do  First grade all over again  Yeah  That doesn't make sense  You weren't even in third grade  You were in first grade  I was in first grade  He was in third grade  He flunks to third grade  So he has to repeat it 
[02:42:00]  So I had to repeat it  Oh it's the worst  We go down to the bus stop  Now we're like the moron family  The whole family  Right  Oh it was all  Oh here's our left back family  Yeah what was his logic  You know  You stick together  One for all  Oh my god  I don't know what his logic was  I think he was more like  He saw my brother fucking up  And felt that we were all  Going to go down that road  So maybe if we were  You know  Four feet tall  In the first grade  That would give us the confidence  To learn our ABCs  I don't know what to do 
[02:42:30]  What a horrid thing to do  I'll do it  You want to talk about  Being bored shitless  It's one of the first jokes  In my act  Because you learn how to read  Yeah  In the first grade  And I'm literally just sitting there  As these kids are fucking sounding  Like I'm reading the  You know  Bing and Sandy  Sandy and Bing  And then he'll be like  And I'm just sitting there  Like oh my god  Yeah the early grades  Are like  If you get through them  Oh you're light years  You're light years  Beyond anybody in kindergarten 
[02:43:00]  They're like writing their name  They're like  The dotted I  Which has like a big circle  That they can't even make meat  You know  It's like this squiggly fucking line  They're fresh out of crayons  I'm like reading at this point  Yeah  Bored  Shitless  That is the weirdest thing  Oh it was awful  Shapes and colors  Wonderful  Let's go to Eddie on Long Island  He went to high school with Anthony  Eddie  Hey how you doing  Hey man  Yeah I remember Anthony  In high school  With the green army coat 
[02:43:30]  What uh  Where did you go  Uh  John Glenn  1980  And you remember me  Oh I remember you clearly  Cause I used to  I was friends with  Joe Curry  And Frank Bush  What's your last name  Guy  Oh yeah okay  I remember your name popping up  Big tall guy  Blonde hair  I used to play football  I was kind of like  Half burnout  Half sports guy  Yeah there were  There were those guys too  The crossover sports guy burnouts  The guys forced into athletics  By their dad  Yeah 
[02:44:00]  But just wanting to hang out  And smoke pot  Yeah it was pretty crazy  Those days  All I remember was  All I remember clearly  Was uh  You guys hanging around  That back door  Yeah we used to hang out  Always hearing your voice  I forgot you guys  Mark something  But you used to see old bombers  We used to smoke joints  At the back door  Yeah because that was  Kind of the place  Where you would go  That was kind of safe  Almost  Yeah around the boat  Not so much that  We used to go on our cars  Right  Yeah and once we were  Old enough and all had cars  You'd just go out  To the pizza place 
[02:44:30]  And smoke  But there was one time  I was smoking a joint  I was smoking a joint  Out back  And uh  It was by the gymnasium doors  And Coach Cirillo  Came out  And um  And he goes  What are you doing  And I just took  A big massive hit  And I just went like  Nothing  Trying to like  Hold it in  And he goes  Nothing huh  Takes his big meaty finger  And stabs it into my gut  And I just went  And exhale this big cloud  Of pot smoke  Into his face 
[02:45:00]  Down to the office  I was constantly in trouble  What was his name?  Cirillo  You just can't make up names  Like this  It's just like  No he was script  And you just can't come up  This guy thought  He was military  You'd walk in  Toes on the line  Count off  You know  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  Yeah  Or 7  What are you doing?  You're not counting off  It's 1, 2, 3  It's gym class  You idiot  Yeah  As a coach  He was totally militaristic  As a gym teacher 
[02:45:30]  I just  I really didn't get into gym too much  Because I was  He always threw us in the weight room  When you were playing  He was constantly  You know what he would do?  He would throw out a bunch of balls  And put people on the weights  And then open up the accordion door  And talk to the fucking girls  On the other side of the door  Or sleep  That's all gym coaches  Yeah  Go to the desk and sleep  Without exception  All bitter guys  Hey Eddie  We had a gym coach  They all had like that  That finger point too  We had a gym coach  He's like  Yeah he had a trial with the Nets  But he blew out his knee  Yep 
[02:46:00]  And that's the only reason he's here  We're lucky to have him  Yeah  Oh are we?  We had one of those  Guy was a nightmare  He was so fucking bitter  Because he was thinking about  The blown out knee  Every day of his life  We had Gil Lilienthal  Who was a guy  Who was supposed to  Have played with the Broncos  And blew out his knee  And he ends up teaching gym  Right  And this guy  If he caught you smoking  You got a choice  He would report you  Or one punch  You'd go into his office  And he would punch you once  Oh you know he's hoping  You're taking the punch  Oh the people that took the punch  Were like legends  They were legendary 
[02:46:30]  Right  So you took the fucking punch  And he would fuck you up  You would be bruised  We had this gym coach  Mr. Cofaso  And he had that  I swear to God  His finger was made out of iron  And you were like in 5th grade  And you'd fuck up jumping jacks  And he'd come over  And he'd be jabbing  You'd see it coming through  The back of the dude's shirt  In front of you  As he's jabbing it  Through your little rib cage  Hey Eddie  Yeah  What do you do these days?  A couple of communications  I started doing phone systems 
[02:47:00]  Back when I graduated  Yeah  And I've been doing it ever since  I've been like a loyal fan  Of you guys  From like day one  Even early  O.B. and Anthony  On B.A.B.  Being a homegrown boy here  Wow  Dude I did shit in high school  And look where I am now  Yeah  Thanks for your  I've done really, really well  But  The bottom line is  It's just those  Those memories  Will always be those memories  Don't they?  Yeah  That's true  Alright Eddie  One of these days  I'd love to hook up  With all those guys again  Even especially Joe  I haven't seen Joe  Since the day I left the school 
[02:47:30]  Joe Curry  He's doing good  He's doing stand up  He's out on Long Island  Doing stand up  Frank Bush moved down south  He's a fucking hillbilly  Yeah  And  That's about all I keep tabs on  These days  Everybody else  I don't know  I see him at the car wash  Occasionally  We got Cowbell Bill  Checking in  Bill  Hey what's up guys  What's up brother?  Not much man  Do you remember when  Lillianthal purchased that bar  On Lockfield Road?  Yep  Yeah  The gym teacher that bought a bar 
[02:48:00]  Bought a bar out on Lockfield Road  And we always used to end up  Going down there drinking  Well drinking  We played there  But  The deal was that  Joe and I  And Alex  We cut out a gym  Like 11th and 12th grade  And the deal was  Whoever had to make it up  Had to go twice a day  And one of those times  They had to run around the track  For the whole 45 minutes  Yep  So you weren't going to graduate  I was that guy  You know  He opens up this bar  And says  You got a band?  You're playing at my bar  Gym teacher 
[02:48:30]  Right  So we used to play  From like  8 o'clock at night  To like 4.30 in the morning  This guy throwing ice at us  Totally degrading us  But we passed  It was during school  Imagine the controversy  That would happen  Like this guy would be arrested  It's students  Being used as labor  In his bar  To pass his class  Yeah  He paid us like nothing  You know  I think  And you were a roadie then  Yep 
[02:49:00]  You know  I would give Anthony  Like you know  Six dollars  Yeah  Some of the shit  That they can get away with  I think I told this story before  I had a guy  He was like  The  Like a history teacher  Slash football coach  The trainer  And I pissed him off  And it was during football season  So he didn't have time  To detain me  So he took me down  To the gym  And locked me in his office  Just locked the door  With the lights out  That couldn't happen  And it's just  Yeah  It's like  It was so before  Like everybody was  Lawsuit crazy  I could have owned that guy 
[02:49:30]  Just like  Dude  Oh yeah  What if there was a fire  Yeah  I'd be dead  I want AIDS  For the rest of the year  And I'm not showing up  And I didn't know  And I just fucking  Just took the humiliation  Yeah  Hate the humiliation  Jesus Christ  This guy used to torture the kids  He used to make us  Hold down this kid  And he looked like Eddie Munster  I forget his name  But he would draw a bullseye  On his face  And then take the magic marker  And wing it at his face  That's funny  You know what's funny  He's like  I don't remember his name  I bet that kid remembers 
[02:50:00]  All of your names  He probably had them  Written on his bedroom wall  Every single one of them  He's cleaning that gun scope  Lilienthal finally got fired  Over that  I think he hit Tommy Slater  Over the head with a pipe  Well he had him in a headlock  And he had one of those  Bars  Holy crap  For the small dumbbell  Right  It was a small dumbbell bar  Right  And he just like  He used to give me noogies  If he caught me smoking in the bathroom  But he just took the pipe  And he lightly tapped the kid  On the head  And it cracked his skull  Yeah  Lightly tapped 
[02:50:30]  From Lilienthal  The guy's arms are like  Friggin' holiday hams  Yeah he probably knew  Exactly where to hit him  Yeah tapped his head  With one of those things  Broke his  Cracked his skull  Like a hard boiled egg  Yeah  A little  Dink  And that was the last  We saw of Gil Lilienthal  Even back then  That was over the line  Oops  There were these  Two black guys  Otto and Stephen Cradle  Right  And for some reason  He just didn't like them  Oh jeez  Yeah  Yeah  Fill in the blank  Right  But he used to get 
[02:51:00]  These guys in full Nelsons  And like squeeze  Until their shoulder blades  Are ready to pop out  Of his skin  And then take him  And throw him  Over the lockers  In the gym locker room  The guy was  A brutal  Sadistic  Son of a bitch  And he was working  For the school system  In Elwood  Yeah  Unbelievable  Bill  Thanks for the memories  There's plenty more  Where that came from  I'll set up another  Poker game  You got it man  Let's do it  All right dude  I'll take your money 
[02:51:30]  Yeah like the last time  You bastard  Later man  All right Bill  There you are  Cowbell Bill everyone  Cowbell Bill  Let's go to Debo  In Arizona  Debo  Hey what's up boys  Hey  You're killing it this morning  Jesus I'm pissing myself  Driving  I've got to be honest  With you though  These kids sports  I'm telling you  We got  I'm a little league coach  Right and we got kids  On the team  They're only allowed  To play one position  For two innings  Then you got to  Take them out  So you got the best  Pitcher in the league  He goes up there  Throws 18 pitches  Strikes out six kids 
[02:52:00]  And you got to bench him  Because he's doing too good  And that's the problem  There's two generations  Happening here  The kids don't understand  Because that's just  What they know  But the adults  That are watching these games  Like oh my god  I wish  You know this kid  Was pitching for my team  When I was a kid  I can't deal with the fact  That your kid sucks  At you know  A particular  I mean that's just showing  He has to go find  What he's good at  Yeah go find something else  How do you get a kid  Fired up about anything  When they start to excel  And you go  Okay that's it  You're done  Thanks for your contribution  Right 
[02:52:30]  That's what you got to do  You got to see  What they're good at  And the only way to do that  Is to let them  Pit them against one another  And hit them against one another  So they have a base  To look at  This guy sucks  This guy's great  And if you fall somewhere  In between  You're you know  Mediocre  But if some kid is great  Then you know  He should pursue this  You don't want to give  This kid false dreams  If he sucks  Yeah  And then it kills that moment  You're treating him  Just like the guy  That is great 
[02:53:00]  And then it kills that moment  In his life  When he finally finds like  Shit I'm actually good  He got it bled out of him  When he was nine  Unbelievable  Alright Debo  Thank you  Let's uh  Let's see  Where are we going there  Let's uh  Let's try Mike in DC  Sorry about that Matt  Mike DC  What's up  What's up boys  Hey  I had the worst  Fucking gym teacher  In elementary school  Kickball  Every day  She was a drunk  All she wanted to do  Was sit under a tree

[03:20:30]  He runs them  What does that show  That you got to admit that Howard's your boss  Used to trash Howard  Used to think you were  You were better than Howard  And now you're going to just admit that Howard's your boss  And Howard used to bash the shit out of him  Your fucking listeners are rolling their eyes  Going what are you doing  You used to bash this guy  You used to thought  You used to think you were better than this guy  And now you're saying that he's your boss  And you're okay with that  And you know what  Take the gig

[03:22:00]  When a couple  Assholes  Like Opie and Anthony  Get hired before we do  And get all this fanfare  And we sit at home  Not having jobs  As good as this radio program is  That's just not how it works  If your radio program was good  People would want to hire you  Don't you get it?  Yeah I don't understand that point  Yeah wait  You stupid fuck  We got a job  You know how desperate radio is  They're looking for talented shows 
[03:22:30]  If they're out there  Trust me  They want to hire them  What do you guys have to do  With the fact that he didn't have a job  He didn't have a job  And we were off for two years  See his shtick was all about  Just shocking his listeners  And the whole climate of radio  Changed to the point where  They didn't want to hire  Those guys anymore  So you had to have something else  Besides the shocking stuff  To move up forward  Right  That's why he wasn't being hired  But you know what  It all worked out for the better  Because look who we're working with 
[03:23:00]  Yep  Look who our boss is  And look who we've befriended  And that son of a bitch  Will take us to the new promised land  I promise you  And like I told  Like I told somebody  At Thanksgiving  I went  Let's see  Howard Stern  Opie and Anthony  This is  That's the decisions  Day one stuff  Who do you want to go with  Yeah that's a brain  Since brain surgery  And it's fine  This is an awesome  They didn't have that decision  Yeah it's not a decision  They never had that decision  We had Eric Logan in studio  He makes those decisions  It wasn't a decision 
[03:23:30]  It wasn't like  Well we want you too  So you guys go off  And decide what company  You want to work for  Yeah  There's a lot of bitterness  Over there  Because there's a bunch of shows  That really wanted to work for XM  And we basically said no  Yeah  We don't need you  We don't want you  Dude it wasn't even a decision  And this kid that works on the show  Is talking about us  During Thanksgiving dinner  Yeah  Talking smack 
[03:24:00]  Like it was  Like they had a choice  O&A or Howard  And what does that even mean  Like just because you're over there  Doesn't mean you're partnered up  Doesn't mean you're part of the  Howard Stern organization  Over there  He might be your boss  He can tell you  What to do  And not to do on the air  But it doesn't mean you're  If he's successful over there  That you're going right along with him  You're still just Bubba 
[03:24:30]  With your Bubba show  How embarrassing  That you've got to admit  That Howard's your boss  This is what Howard had to say  About you  Why don't they have an award  For most jealous  And give it to those two guys  Bubba sponge  And the other guy  Too many candidates  Moby the sponge  Moby dick  Moby dick  Moby dick  Well the crowd started booing  Now  They should just name themselves  Howard Stern  They should  Why do they come up with  And the only thing that they do  On their own  Is give themselves a name  And it's always a bad name  It's always a bad 
[03:25:00]  It's Bubba the love sponge  You know  What kind of  I don't want to be in an industry  With a Bubba the love sponge  Oops  I don't want to go to an award show  With a Bubba the love sponge  Oops  I don't want to be in the same room  With Bubba the love sponge  Oops  There's your boss  There's your boss  There Bubba  Do you want to lick that ass  A little more  There's your boss  When you're bashing us  There you go  Love sponge  There you go  Not too much love there  Mr. Sponge  The guy whose asshole  You're making out with  The guy who's spreading his cheeks 
[03:25:30]  And you're sticking your Bubba the love lips  Right up his asshole  And making out with it  Lapping it  Was just there  You just heard him  Beating the shit out of you  Why don't you acknowledge that  And talk about that  Calling you a nothing  You're a hack  Did you guys have a  With a stupid name  With a stupid name  Before this  Bubba?  Bubba?  No  He wasn't even on the radar  He wasn't even on our radar  This guy wasn't even an issue  Oh so this guy is a phony  Yeah  The guy's not even an issue  He's working on Howard's show 
[03:26:00]  Or on Howard's station  On Sirius  Because there's nobody  Out there  That didn't have a job  That could have been hired  That's the problem  A lot of people in terrestrial radios  If they're talented  The companies that they're with  Want to keep them  It would be nice for some satellite company  To hire away some people  But right now  Terrestrial radio  Will take care of the talented people  The people that are leaving 
[03:26:30]  Are the people that  A. Are fired  And blackballed  And were exiled  From terrestrial radio  Hello  I'll raise my hand  And people that were fired  For lack of ratings  Lack of talent  Terrestrial radio  Is not willing to pay them enough  Because they suck  And Sirius will pick them up  And that's what they did with Bubba  Howard had 14 months  To find people to fill his station 
[03:27:00]  He found Bubba the love sponge  An unemployed radio guy  Unimportant guy  Unimportant, unemployed  One market wonder  If that  And that's it  And now  Howard was bashing him  Saying he wouldn't be in the same room  Embarrassed to be in the same business  Doesn't want to be with a Bubba the love sponge  And now  Instead of just taking the gig  And making believe it didn't happen  Out of embarrassment  You sit there and lap his ball sack 
[03:27:30]  Where's your pride, man?  Have some pride, you dude bear  Where's your pride?  You'll never hear us go  Our boss, Howard  Oh  Please  I'm embarrassed for you today  Where's your pride, man?  Yeah, and he's going to take him  To the promised land  Not his own talent  Yeah  Yeah  We're going to ride those coattails  We're going to hitch our wagon  To this right here  And hope it takes us to the stars  So it gets better

[03:32:30]  How you feeling, Lee Abrams?  Howard assembled two people  That has completely destroyed any credibility you guys had in the shock-jock industry  I have not heard much of a buzz on you guys' people over there  You know what?  If you wanna play the game, it's fine  But be honest, there's a big buzz on the Opie and Anthony show  We're mentioned in articles almost daily at this point  And wait a minute, wait 
[03:33:00]  Regardless  Let's say  But I need the phoniness of this shit  Let's say  It's that phony bullshit  There wasn't one article about this program  Howard  Is the one that was getting the press going over to Sirius, Bubba  If you think for a second  You know your boss, Howard?  You know you admitted that he's your boss, that guy?  If you're so f**king delusional  To think that that had anything to do with you  Then I have to pull out the I feel sorry

The guy is latching on to Howard's cock  You fat fucking faggot  He's borrowed himself into Howard's ass  Yeah  Like a  A tick  Yes  You're a tick  A big fat engorged tick on Howard's asshole  How do you have any fucking pride  And lick Howard Stern's ass?  Because he used to fight the same fight we did  Because, you know, Howard's a phony, a hypocrite and all that 
[03:34:30]  He called him out on it all the time  But now, Howard's his boss  And now he's going to lick his ass  Let's see who's working  Let's see who's working longer, Bubba  You say you are going to be in radio longer than us?
