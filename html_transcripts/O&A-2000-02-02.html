<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment dominated by a caller, Vinnie, who launched into a racist and homophobic rant, filled with offensive generalizations about various ethnic and racial groups.  Other callers echoed his prejudiced views, leading to a heated debate. While initially amused, the hosts eventually attempted to steer the conversation in a different direction.  The show then transitioned to a prank call where a caller's mother was falsely told her son was in jail for soliciting prostitutes, including a transvestite, and had contracted AIDS. This prank call elicited a strong emotional response from the mother.

The next segment shifted gears, beginning with a discussion about hypnosis, sparked by a caller suggesting Anthony be hypnotized into performing a disgusting act.  Anthony agreed, and the conversation segued into his recent breakup, detailing his comical (and desperate) attempts to retrieve his belongings from his ex-girlfriend's apartment, including climbing through a window. This prompted a series of caller stories about their own relationship mishaps, many sexually explicit and embarrassing. Cowbell Bill, a frequent guest, was in studio, contributing his own tales. A significant portion was dedicated to a feud with DJ Will Pentarvis, with callers comparing Opie and Anthony's style to John Rocker’s.  A listener letter expressing disgust at the show was read, along with a Kirk Douglas voice clip and a listener's story about witnessing their parents having sex.  The segment ended with Stacker 2 commercials and further discussion of listener stories, including a detailed recounting of a child witnessing parental sexual activity.  Throughout this section, the hosts used copious profanity and crude humor.

Following this, a large portion of the show focused on listener calls detailing embarrassing incidents involving their parents’ sexual activities.  Multiple callers described accidentally walking in on their parents having sex, often with graphic details.  One caller recounted his mother caressing his face after an injury. Another described repeatedly peeking at a friend's mother and her boyfriend.  A significant part focused on Keith, whose accounts of witnessing his parents' sexual encounters, along with his mother's subsequent phone call detailing additional incidents, dominated the conversation.  The descriptions included details about positions and humorous remarks like “two fat people having sex.”  Gary Conrad, the in-studio hypnotist, attempted to hypnotize Anthony, who remained skeptical, while others, including Spaz, were successfully hypnotized and exhibited unusual behaviors.  More embarrassing caller stories punctuated this segment, with commercial breaks featuring live reads for Diamond Vision and Playboystore.com. The tone remained crude and sexually explicit.

The in-studio hypnosis segment with Gary Conrad continued, focusing on Spaz and other individuals (Pedro and Joe, callers) who were hypnotized into various personas and scenarios.  These included a Black History Month lecture, James Brown, Tom Ligas, a Japanese kamikaze pilot, a strip poker player, a basketball player, Eddie Murphy, and a cowboy in women's underwear, along with interactions with a blow-up doll. Spaz’s apparent childbirth of a rubber chicken and subsequent diaper change were also featured.  Offensive and inappropriate jokes were frequent. Listener calls offered reactions to the events and shared further stories about parental behavior.  The unofficial Opie and Anthony website was promoted as the location for recordings.

The show concluded with a segment where the hosts expressed their dissatisfaction with a previous segment or guest ("the guy"), believing it failed to retain their audience. They announced switching to promoting the "Kane" show on 92.3 K-Rock instead, mentioning Anthony's time spent behind the equipment and the absence of their show's promotion from their website.  No guests were present during this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It is Opie and Anthony. Hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us. Do we know what's  going on with the New Hampshire primaries? What? Do we care? Is it like politics? Yeah.  I think George W. Bush is going to be the next president of these United States. That's  about it. John McCain. John McCain. They're all a bunch of goofballs. I hate them all. 
[00:00:30]  See them all. I mean, freaking Al Gore, they're trying to make him look human. And the fact  is, he looks like Frankenstein when he walks. They have him shaking hands there in New Hampshire  and he's just like, that ain't going to work. No. But George W. Bush will be the next president  of these United States. And I love Bill Bradley, but I mean, I got to say it because this is  what happens. He just looks like a slob. It's like, Bill, press your suits. Do something.  Comb your hair. He won't be elected if he looks like a slob. No, I mean, they say the 
[00:01:00]  only reason Clinton was elected is because he looks so good on TV and the women went crazy  for him. Yeah. That's what happens. What lady's going to vote for Bill Bradley? They're all  going to go for Bush. Yeah. They will. Like, he's got everything going for him. He's got the  father that was the president. He's got boatloads of cash behind his campaign. He's got the  backing of the Republican Party. And the Democratic Party is a bunch of goofballs. And he looks  good on a snowmobile. Oh, yeah, yeah. You see the snowmobile? At least he can pull it 
[00:01:30]  off. Remember the Michael Dukakis fiasco when they're like, hey, you know, he'll look cool  in a tank with his big tank helmet on. Oh, you look like one of those Mets things in  the back window of the cars with a bob head bobbing around. That was it. His big head  sticking out of the tank. That lost him the election right there. You got to think when  that footage happened to that they filmed it ahead of time and his people had to look  at it and go, yeah, we'll use this. What are you, stupid? Look like a retard, like you should 
[00:02:00]  be on a short bus. But George W is doing all the right things, you know, not talking about  the cocaine issue. Everybody bringing that up at the beginning when he first started  saying that he was running. Apparently, there were reports that he was into coke back when  he was young. Who would think, you know, you're some young in the 80s doing coke? Well, I think  he was the only one. He was the only one in, I believe. Dead man now. Dead man now. 
[00:02:30]  That's pertinent to this argument. This is Vinnie here. Vinnie. Yeah. What's up?  Hey, fellas. Half Buchanan for president. Let me tell you why.  Whoa. That's a little far, right?  This guy wants to build a wall around the whole country to keep all these scum from getting  in here like these Mexicans and these other animals that have come in and ruined this country.  Mexican animals? Like chihuahuas?  Nothing against Rick, your producer, but let's face it, Owen. Blacks and Hispanics have ruined  this country. Holy cow. I agree 100%. You have the backing of me, the Greek man. 
[00:03:00]  I mean, the blacks, I mean, come on. Black males are only 6% of the population, yet they  commit 50% of the crime. I think the other 50% is committed by the blacks to get away  with it. And the rest of the crime, I mean, it's even a car stall. You think it's a white  boy doing it? It's either a spick or a black. Holy cow. Come on. What about the chinks?  Hey, Anthony, do you think the people that make the club would be in business if it weren't  for blacks and Hispanics? Absolutely not, then. 
[00:03:30]  And most of the locksmiths would be out of business, too.  Yeah, the Greek man agrees with you 100%. You wouldn't have to lock the doors. It would  be a paradise, eh? No, it's the truth. And I think Rick might be a good guy, but, you  know, hey, I hate to speak, talk bad mouth to his people, but they're doing nothing but  commit crimes. And, you know, and I don't think, Pat, you can. They will be meeting with  Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and kissing all their black ass like Clinton. Oh, my God.  Let me come off. Why is everyone laughing? I agree 100%. Tell me. You know, it's the truth. 
[00:04:00]  Everybody out there knows it. The American dream. All the blacks swimming back to Africa with  their spick under each arm. A lot of doing it. So, John Rocker, on the Greek man show.  So, John Rocker, what are you doing for the first month of baseball this year? Can you play  some golf? Here's another thing. John Rocker, what did this guy do wrong? He can't talk  anymore in this country. Right. Hey, I don't want to ride a subway either with a bunch of  fags or, you know, age people on my back either. I mean, this guy's telling the truth.  Oh, I almost forgot about the faggots here. Yeah, you know, you don't want to forget the 
[00:04:30]  fags. Hey, Vinny, you want to do mornings and any W? I listen to this every day. It's  our new morning show. Let me tell you something. I listen to those two greats in the morning.  There's nothing else on in the morning, though. Oh, Vinny, you are just an angry, angry  man. Hey, Ed, what? Hey, Ed, have I said anything that's a lie to you? I heard nothing. Everything's  a truth. Why don't you get out there and say it, but I will. Get out of here. Bone dry  here. I want to come in there and apply for a job. First of all, I'll take spaz off there 
[00:05:00]  because that guy shouldn't be working for you. I've been trying to go off for the last  couple of weeks. How do you work a phone with the hood over your head there? No, stop.  Bone dry here. And they go stop like I'm going over the line by saying that. Hold on, we've got  a counterpoint on line seven here. Let's see what this is about. Rob, what's up?  All right, this guy's a little much, don't you think? Hey, Rob, have I said anything that's  not true? When you get your car stolen, have you ever had a car stolen? Uh, yeah. Yeah,  who stole it? What? Did they ever find out who stole it? Yeah, some Italian guy from the 
[00:05:30]  Bronx. Yeah, I doubt it, pal. That's exactly what it was, right there on stream IM. You're  a fag. You know, what are you doing? I'm a what? It's on TV. You're a fag. I'm a what?  A fag. Oh, that's the extent of, you know, your whole language? That's all you can say  is fag. What do you want me to call you? You want me to start saying curse words?  I mean, obviously, it's about all you can say. You're not, obviously, too bright at all.  Oh, no? No, not at all. Let me ask you something, my friend. Let me say something. Say something.  Black males, they're 6% of the population. Am I lying when I say they commit over 50% of 
[00:06:00]  crime in the country? Yeah, I think so. Well, I am. FBI, I think that's a crime in 1998.  I'll show you the book. They're committing over 50% of all the crime. They're 6% of  the population. Uh-oh. We're losing Vinny. I didn't even want to argue with you. Satan's  pulling him back. Oh, my God. We can't lose him. He's our new morning show. Vinny.  I'm here. You're there? Yeah. All right, hold on. I hope your phone's crapping out,  though, but Chris is on the line with Vinny. Chris, what's up? How you doing, guys? Good. 
[00:06:30]  Hey, Vinny, let me ask you a question. What nationality are you, dude?  Uh-oh. What are you? I think he said I'm Italian. Uh-oh. I was hoping it was something  else. A.K.A. Sopranos. I love that show. I guess people never killed anybody either,  so please. And you sound like a closet fag, to tell you the truth. Chris, to be totally  honest with you, his phone crapped out to the point it hung up. Figures, right? No, he'll  call back knowing him. Oh, totally, because an ignorant guy like that, A.K.A. John Rocker II,  you know, I mean, this is the way the world is. It's not a question of saying, well, one 
[00:07:00]  people's better than the other. Right. Everybody does wrong things. All right, man. Bye.  Bye. Let's go to Greg. Greg, you're next on N.E.W. What's up?  We need a president. He's the man. He should be the next man in charge. He's speaking the  truth. Is he lying? Look at the statistics. Yeah. He was perfectly honest. When it comes  down to it, he's a man. He knows what he's talking about. That's all I got, fellas. Take  care. All right. Thank you. Wow. We're doomed as a people, by the way. 
[00:07:30]  Pete, what's going on? Yeah, I agree with that guy, Vinny, okay? The only problem he  has is he couldn't articulate his words properly. He's just too street stupid, okay? But the  truth of the matter is, is, you know, the one question they asked before was, well, what's  he? What are you, Vinny? I'm third generation American, okay? My parents, my mother and father  were born here. Their parents were born here. My great-great-grandparents were born here.  When they came to this country, they came to this country with nothing in their pockets, the  shoes on their feet, and all they asked for was a job to work for pennies a day to perpetuate  their own family and their own race. Now these people float over on in the tubes. You 
[00:08:00]  heard a song about it. Cubans drown. I mean, for God's sakes, guys, you know, some of you  don't understand what I'm saying, and now they float over to the country on in the tubes,  rubber, dead bodies, whatever they can get to here, and they put their hands out and say,  what about me? What about me? I agree. They're all around this freaking country. It's full.  No vacancy. Put the no vacancy sign up. All right, Pete. Thank you.  You know what I'm saying? That's it. Well, I agree with the immigration thing. Yeah, I  got you there. People completely outraged now, Anthony. Enough. Vinny hit a nerve with 
[00:08:30]  everybody, it seems like. I wonder why. What he was saying wasn't too controversial.  Vinny's back on the air here. Vinny, what's going on? Hey, what are they? I thought you  were finished. No, my phone, like, went out on me, but, you know, one guy was wanting to  know what I was. I'm Italian, and, you know, not for nothing, and Anthony could back me up  on this. Oh, yeah, lump me in. Okay. Anthony, our people, we discovered this country. It  was named after us, and we basically built it. I mean, come on. Right. Am I right? All  us, all us Dago cement workers. I mean, I may have came off a little strong, which I didn't 
[00:09:00]  mean to. I mean, there's a lot of good. A little? There's a lot of good blacks and Hispanic  people out there. Don't get me wrong, but I'm just saying. I mean, I'm sick and tired.  I watch the news every night. I mean, if you don't see what's going on out there, I mean,  it's a crying shame. I mean, what these people are doing, I don't know if it's the way they're  brought up, you know, with our fathers or whatever the deal is, but they've ruined this  country. I mean, they've ruined it. Yeah. All right, hold on a line, because I'm sure people  are going to be outraged in a few seconds here. Hold on. I don't know why. All right, 
[00:09:30]  hold on, though. We'll go back to Vinny in a second. Let's go to Paulie, who's a cop.  Paulie, what's up? No, I agree with what Vinny's saying there, though. I mean, you know,  I'm a cop, and I work downtown, and let me tell you, in like 10 years, I've arrested  maybe five white guys. You look at the news every night, what do you see? The most hyenas  crimes that are committed? Who are they committed by? Right or wrong? Are we talking serial  killers? Because that's always the white guy. Oh, of course. You got our, you know, like  Rifkin and stuff. He was a white guy. You got me on that. The creepy white guys. You talking 
[00:10:00]  to arsonists? Those are always white, too. No, not always. Rapes and all this other crime  that's coming on. Yeah. I got to tell you, a lot of rapes that you see in the paper when  you see the composite drawing sketch. Black guys. There's some angry black guys out there  with the rape. Of course, all the time. Robbery, stuff like that. Yeah, armed robbery. I'll  go with the black guy. You always see that. Always. Always. And also, Vinny. Domestic violence. 
[00:10:30]  I got to go with Whitey on that. Sometimes Hispanic. I don't know about that. Babies falling out  the window. Always Hispanic. What is with the Hispanics? They can't kick their friggin'  babies in the high-rise building windows. Take some of the chicken wire off the chicken  coop and put it up on the window. Too many kids to keep track of me. Why? Oh, man.  Frank is Dominican. Frank? I'm Dominican. First generation. Mother came off the boat by way 
[00:11:00]  of Puerto Rico. Are you on a stolen car phone? Actually, no. It's a work phone. I haven't  knocked up a liquor store or stolen a car in at least a week. All right. Well, you're on  the line with Vinny. Vinny, Frank is a Dominican guy. Hello, Frank. How are you doing, Vinny?  Hey, Frank. Are you a hard-working Hispanic man? I consider myself. I make, I clear about  90 Gs a year, so I'm doing okay. Let me tell you something. I'm very proud of you. I think  that's great. I have nothing against hard-working people. And don't get me wrong, not all blacks  and Hispanics are robbers and murderers. I'm not trying to say that, but I'm saying, 
[00:11:30]  if you look at the statistics, they're supposedly the minority in this country. They're the ones  that are filling up our jails. I mean, you knock out the blacks and the Hispanics from  the equation. I mean, who's going to be in these jails? Nobody. You ain't going to need  any prison guards. You're not going to have to buy a club for your car. You ain't going  to have to lock your door basically at night. Well, that might be true here in the urban  centers, but you go out to the Midwest and who's committing the crimes all out there? It's all  the rednecks and all the, you know, the unintelligent people. I don't know about that. I don't know. 
[00:12:00]  I watch Andy Griffith and it doesn't look that bad, Mayberry. Just notice the drunk is the  only one in the jail cell. You want to look at cops in some of these cities out in the  Midwest. Who's committing all the crimes out there? Yeah, white trash. Who do they always  have hot tides? You know, in Missouri and St. Louis and these places. The drunk white guy  in the pickup truck. I can't walk the straight line. That's pretty funny to watch. And by the  way, Columbus didn't discover this place. He was lost and the Native Americans were here  before anybody else about 5,000 years. Oh, please. So just a minor technicality. 
[00:12:30]  Well, let me tell you something about history. Back then, it was like the beginning of Monopoly  or something, you know? Yeah, I mean, if he wants to go there.  You just kind of bump into a country and you claim it, you kill everyone, and then you own  it. That's how it had to be done back then. You conquered places. That was the way of the world.  Well, I do got to say thank you to the Spanish people for lending them the money for the  boats. There you go. Yeah, that was pretty cool. Our contribution to history. Queen Isabella.  Okay, folks. Thank you. Thank you, Frank. That's all she wanted was some of Columbus' Italian 
[00:13:00]  sausage. Queen Isabella. I think you had a nailer for those three boats.  Hello? Yeah, I thought I'd object little intelligence to this conversation here.  That has no place on this show. I know that.  O.P. and Anthony. More stupidity. On the way.  1027 WNEW. I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  And Anthony. What a douchebag. 
[00:13:30]  Greenwrecked radio. Ben Goldberg.  This is sicker than Faces of Death.  1027 WNEW.  Hello, Mark.  Hello.  Are you ready to play hide my mom? I'm in jail?  Sure.  All right. Now, what are you going to tell your mom when she gets on the phone?  I don't know. I'm going to tell her I was with a couple of prostitutes.  You're going to tell her that you were with a couple of prostitutes?  Yeah.  Wow, that could be pretty good.  That's a good one.  Yeah, I haven't been to jail in like about eight years, so. 
[00:14:00]  So, she thinks you've cleaned up your act, huh?  Yeah, and I'm happily married, you know?  Uh-oh.  Oh, and you're married and you got called the prostitutes?  Yeah.  Maybe you could tell her something like you can't tell your wife, obviously, so you had to call her.  Yeah, I had to call her a couple of minutes.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Okay, cool.  Make this good. Here we go.  All right. She should be ringing. You're going to have to speak up real loud because the phones really suck.  Okay.  Yeah.  Mark.  What?  Listen, it's Mark.  Yeah?  Listen, I'm in jail. 
[00:14:30]  What?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  I got caught on a couple of prostitutes.  Who's this?  Mark.  It's your son, Mark.  Where are you?  I'm in jail.  Where are you?  In Lowell.  Where he is.  Downtown.  Don't tell Gina.  I need you to come bail me out.  Who?  You.  With what?  Oh, if you're waiting, I said, I don't know.  You can't.  Don't call me.  Don't call my house.  This call is being monitored, ma'am.  Okay.  I didn't know if you were joking with me or serious or what. 
[00:15:00]  Mom, serious.  We've set...  Oh, jeez.  We've set the bail at $5,000, ma'am.  That would be cash.  $5,000?  Yes.  What did he do?  He was found with a couple of prostitutes in the Lowell area, one of which was a transvestite.  And it's a serious charge, ma'am.  Will someone be coming to pick him up?  Ma!  He's a mole?  Ma!  What? 
[00:15:30]  Can you come?  We've got to clear this up before it makes the paper tomorrow morning.  Yeah, because now the newspapers print all the johns that were caught with prostitutes.  So his name will be emblazoned for all to see in the Boston Herald tomorrow.  Who am I speaking to?  This is Officer Jenkins.  Officer Jenkins.  I'll have to call his brother.  I'll call his brother and see if I can get the money.  We know also the prostitute has tested positive for the AIDS virus, which is another problem he's going to have to deal with.  Hello, ma'am?  Yes, I'm here. 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  Where's Sonny Boy?  Are you speaking up to your mother?  Yeah, ma'am.  What?  Well, I don't know how to tell you how this happened.  I was with the brain.  You know the brain?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I picked him up with a couple of them.  It's not a laughing matter, son.  I know.  I know.  Your mother sounds very upset.  You try to raise your kids.  You do your best.  I'm sure you did your best, didn't you, ma'am?  Yeah.  And look at what happens.  Oh, my God. 
[00:16:30]  She's so upset.  I can't do this anymore.  Ma!  I can't do this.  Ma!  Hey, ma!  Excuse me, ma'am.  Yeah.  Happy Mother's Day, ma!  It's a joke.  It's all a joke.  Oh, I'm going to burn in hell for this, ma'am.  Oh, no.  Ma!  She's all right.  He's fine.  He's not in jail.  It's only...  Why?  You're live on the radio.  You could smack him in the head.  Mom, you still there? 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  Talk to us, ma'am.  Look how upset.  Oh, my God.  I've got to make a phone call.  I called back.  Did you know she was going to get that upset?  No.  Oh, my God.  You're going to be like a joke, but you know, I'm always joking with her.  Oh, no.  Honestly, I'm always joking with her.  Oh, we feel horrible now.  You've got to smooth things over and call us back, man.  All right.  All right, bro.  Oh, no.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Bye.  Oh, no.  That one didn't work well. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't speak to.  Oh, no.  Hey, stop.  1-0-7-W-N-E-W.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you in love with me, Kevin?  Yes, we're homo.  Love gay people.  Love gay people.  Yes, we're homo.  It's so easy to get guys naked.  Yes.  These two have a lot of pent-up sexual frustration.  I hate them.  Yes, we're coming out.  We're gay.  Hey, is this the homo in the Anthony show? 
[00:18:00]  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  Two guys who are not afraid to love each other.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to it.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, and your mom did say I was high.  Oh, come on, mom.  Don't bang Opie.  You f*** my mom.  I'm f*** yours.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it.  The hell with the bargain, Ryan.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:18:30]  A couple of real motherf***ers.  That sounds big.  What's up, Anthony?  Hi, man.  My buddy, my pal.  What's up, Dan?  My partner in crime.  Hey, Ian.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show,  the most talked about radio show in the entire country at this point.  Wow.  Let's not kid ourselves.  Everyone loves to hate the Opie and Anthony show.  Isn't that funny?  And we laugh at all of you. 
[00:19:00]  I'm hiccuping.  I've laughed so hard.  You're coughing at all of you.  We laugh at all of you.  Yeah.  I love how people love to spell out our impending demise.  Remember, like, the first three months we were here?  It was going to be over.  We were out of here after three months.  Yeah.  It wouldn't last.  Yeah.  And then it was six months.  Yeah.  They'll never make the new year.  Oh, yeah.  And then they'll never make a year. 
[00:19:30]  Okay.  And then they'll never make the...  It just keeps going and going until, you know, two years later.  What?  We're past a year and a half at this point.  Yeah.  I don't worry about it.  It doesn't look like we're going anywhere anytime soon, people.  Any of our detractors that like to say, uh, well, I guess that's it.  You know, they took a little hit in some of the ratings and, uh, that must be it.  Oops.  Sorry.  Why are the bosses around here patting us on the back and congratulating us and trying 
[00:20:00]  to get us hookers and stuff?  And at this station, it doesn't seem to matter.  It'll take quite a while for us to get down to a .5.  Or .8.  So we still have plenty of time while we really screw up.  I got to say, I got to say, because I know he's listening, because he's such a loser.  Tell me, Tom, you took our bait and you're such a loser.  We laugh at you today.  Do you think you're ever going to get to us?  You loser. 
[00:20:30]  He's attempting to trash the only, the only show on any W that's, uh, making money for  this company.  What are you talking about?  You ought to have Brian on a car phone.  Brian, how are you?  Jam like it.  Eddie, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just wanting to talk about like it.  He just, as soon as he got on, he was like, you know, how's your hooker?  They went from 14 to 7.  How could they talk, you know?  Hey, Eddie, we got under his skin so bad, he had to spend another hour on his syndicated 
[00:21:00]  radio show that supposedly is all over the country.  The country doesn't know who Opie and Anthony is, but he's, he's, uh, helping us out on  that front.  Now people all over the country know who Opie and Anthony is.  He also brought up, I mean, later on, a couple hours into the show, he, uh, started  talking about Anthony.  He said that, uh, Anthony's probably going to lose his CB radio in the divorce.  You know?  And then, and then I called up and I said, that's not true. 
[00:21:30]  And he hit me in the head with a yule lock.  And then he was talking about, you know, Anthony's mom and Anthony's smoking again.  I don't know where this guy's going.  I think he's, uh, he's lost in space, Opie.  I know, that's why I just hung up on him.  Let's go to Ed next.  Ed, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Guys, Pubby Tom.  Yeah.  Come on.  All right.  I got a few points to make.  One is that he was making a big freaking deal about how Z100 and 97.1 beat you guys. 
[00:22:00]  Meanwhile, it is a known fact that, that, uh, music stations get 10 times more listeners  than any talk station.  You know, we don't need anyone defending us today.  We, we said it yesterday, too, um, that we took a hit in the ratings.  We went from 14th place, uh, 7th place overall to 14th.  Yeah, you guys did say that.  But the fact is, and this is a major fact, which he even slipped and said during his little  rant last night, that what matters the most when you do a talk show, Ed and I are now in  the talk show genre, is to do very well 25 to 44, uh, with men. 
[00:22:30]  Okay?  Anthony, what are our ratings for, uh, men 25 to 44 this past book?  Number one, Opie.  Thank you, Anthony.  That's right.  That's all that matters.  That's all that matters.  The 12 plus number is a bragging right.  We would like to be higher, but, uh, the truth of the matter is we're not pulling in,  um, 12 year olds, 13 year old and 14 year old, uh, boys or girls. 
[00:23:00]  And we're not getting the upper end of the spectrum, uh, the 60, uh, year old, uh, men  or women either.  We have, we have a very loyal following.  We're making an S load of money for the company.  They are very happy with us.  And that's the truth.  Yeah.  That's it.  What's pathetic is, uh, Tom Likas, we set the table for him.  When we get off the air at seven o'clock, we have a huge, huge audience.  Yeah.  That's, that's another thing I was going to say.  He would have no one if it wasn't for you guys.  He doesn't have anyone.  Hold on. 
[00:23:30]  The .8, those listeners will come from you guys.  Ed, a .8, you might as well have no one listening.  Okay.  The fact is that there's a religious, uh, programming station out of Jersey that beats Tom Likas  at night.  And, uh, contrary to what Tubby Tom says, this, uh, our show today is not going to be a three  hour infomercial for the Tom Likas show.  Oh, no.  It's a quick, uh, thrashing.  And then we move on.  And then that's it.  And the fact is, every time we do talk about him, his, uh, numbers don't go up.  Cause, you know, we just tell everyone to stop listening to you, Tom. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  We hated you from the beginning.  We still hate you.  And I guarantee you this, Tom, Tom, I know we get under his skin and that makes my day.  Trust me.  Jam.  I will guarantee you this one, Mr. Likas.  Okay.  Ant and I will last in New York radio much longer than you will.  That is a fact.  Ant and I are up to 19 months. 
[00:24:30]  You're up to three months.  You want to make a little wager to see who lasts longer, pal?  I would like to say it wouldn't even last a year, but they'll probably give you a year  just to be nice about it.  Come on.  Cause we have bigger problems at this radio station than getting rid of the .8 night show.  You know what blows?  What blows around here?  The station is in the crapper, takes a big tank, again, per usual, and we get lumped in with it. 
[00:25:00]  Mm-hmm.  We're doing very well, thank you very much.  And then you got to open up the post and read how no one's listening.  Not to this show.  We have people listening.  Wait a minute.  We have a huge audience.  All you got to do was go to the Super Bowl party to figure that out.  Okay.  But the post, you know, they see N.E.W. as a 1.  I don't even know what the station's at right now.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's a 1.2, Anthony. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  The average is 1.2.  Let's just put this in perspective so people could understand this, okay?  The station's at a 1.2 overall.  Our morning show is a 0.5 compared to Howard's 9.0, just to put it in perspective, okay?  Yeah.  Then middays is a 1.1, I believe.  You and I shoot up to a 2.9.  2.9.  Mm-hmm.  And we hand that whole audience over to Tom. 
[00:26:00]  Who, in return, hangs on to how much of that audience?  0.8.  0.8.  People punching out like mad.  There's a station.  All they do is religious broadcasting out of Jersey that beats him at night.  Wow.  Better than, uh...  Jay, you're on a car phone.  And he was talking about...  Damn wagon.  He was talking about honesty on his radio show last night.  If you want us to be honest, why doesn't he talk about where he got his, uh, you know,  flip him out Friday idea from? 
[00:26:30]  No.  Flip him out Friday, okay?  Or whatever he calls him.  Flash him Friday.  I honestly don't know.  The fact is, and this is the reason why we hate him and we'll never support him, we  know for a fact that he stole that idea from us.  It's a rip-off of our whip him out Wednesday.  We said it the first day he was on the air that we won't acknowledge him and help him out  until he admits that he stole the greatest radio promotion of all time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Just in case you're wondering why we hate him so much. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And he talks about being honest.  Come on, Tom.  Tell him.  Tell him about how you were, uh, down in Turks and Caicos.  Come on.  Broadcasting live the same week Ant and I were.  With Sam Adams.  And how Ant and I were doing whip him out Wednesday down there.  And the whole island was loving it.  Couldn't believe it.  Thought it was unbelievable.  And you even admit on the show that...  But I call it Flash Friday.  ...that you started the promotion about a month after you got back from Turks and Caicos.  Totally different. 
[00:27:30]  I got it on tape.  You said it.  A month after you got back from Turks and Caicos when you were broadcasting live at the  same promotion we were for a week straight.  You start this great promotion of yours.  Mama!  That's why we hate you and we'll never support you.  And can't wait for you to be gone.  Point eight.  That's an embarrassment.  We hand you an audience.  You can't even keep it.  Well, who the hell wants to talk about him anymore? 
[00:28:00]  Load.  Huh?  That load.  Crap.  John, what's going on?  John!  John, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, John.  Hey, my name's John.  I think, uh...  How you doing, John?  Hey, we're going to take you out like his style.  Hello.  This clown spent the whole...  His first 15 minutes of his show defending how come his ratings sucked. 
[00:28:30]  Well, there was a Subway series that was building.  Yeah.  And the whole station revamped.  So he spent the first 15 minutes defending about how his show sucks.  And then after he finished, you know, getting himself on some sort of solid ground,  if I was to take pot shots at you guys.  That's fine.  That's a freaking joke.  I'm not going to mention him by name.  I don't care if they mention me by name.  It gives me ratings.  The only reason why I listen to the SOB is because he happens to fall on the radio after you  if I'm doing my driving late at night.  John, that's fine. 
[00:29:00]  You don't have to defend us because, you know what?  We were laughing.  We were in our office laughing at the top of our lungs going, we got him again.  We got under his skin.  Look, he has to spend an hour of his syndicated show that's syndicated all over the country  talking about Opie and Anthony.  Who wins?  Who wins, Tom?  You loser.  The guy only talks about things that he thinks he has a strong standing on.  He picks on women and how his whole philosophy of men.  The guy's a freaking joke, number one.  Number two, if you had any sense, you'd understand the philosophy of radio, the way you guys evolved, 
[00:29:30]  the way you guys paid your dues when you needed to and kicked ass when you needed to,  and hopefully grow.  This guy's going nowhere fast.  John, our ratings are fine.  With everything that went on in the last three months, we're very happy with what we got yesterday.  And we're still number one with the demo that matters the most.  Men, 25 to 44.  And with everything else, fine.  They go up and down.  Who cares?  But it's nice that they do go up as opposed to certain other shows. 
[00:30:00]  The biggest embarrassment of this radio station is the Tubby Tom show, by the way.  You know, we know our morning show sucks and all, .5, you know, whatever.  But, I mean, they don't have a lead in the morning show at all, okay?  They have to kind of start from zero.  And they don't do much better from zero, obviously, zero to .5.  But to hand somebody the huge audience that we get in the afternoons and then turn that around and get a .8, that's an embarrassment. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  That's an embarrassment.  I mean, come on.  Come on.  .8.  .8.  .8.  .8.  Unbelievable.  Makes me want to pull out of Yulah.  Danny, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I tried to get through to his show.  Danny from New York.  How you doing?  You're on the Tom Likens show.  Hello, Tom.  Ed Jerko.  I tried to get through to his radio program and his gay lover slash phone screener, Mike Douchebag. 
[00:31:00]  He got all the information.  I hit him with everything.  The listener parties, how he stole your promotion and stuff like that.  He kept me on hold for 15 minutes and cut me off.  You know why?  Because he's so calculated.  The one thing about our radio show, we'll just go to the phones.  You want to trash us, fine.  Do it.  We don't care.  Yeah, but he set up so many calls last night that made it so calculated.  The point he wanted to make, he made sure the calls followed suit. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, of course.  That's sad.  That's sad.  I think he had the cojones, you know, to take some abuse from your fans, you know.  He doesn't have the balls.  Yeah, of course.  He doesn't have the balls.  Ed and I confronted him when he was live in New York for a week.  We went right into his studio.  He couldn't take it anymore.  He turned off our microphones.  He got so freaked out.  You were making fun of my voice.  My radio voice.  We have a copy of that?  We got to play that on our show.  It is so freaking funny. 
[00:32:00]  I start mocking his voice and he's like, yeah, that's it.  Yeah, you got to play that, man.  Well, I wanted to rip him a new one for you guys, man.  Keep up the good work.  All right, man.  All right, yo.  Bye.  Bye.  We're just about done with this and then we'll start our real show.  Who's this?  Raul?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up, Raul?  Yeah, man.  Yo, that guy is so horrible, man.  He just sits there just trying to abuse you guys.  He was scared to say you guys' names, man.  I know.  That guy sucks, man.  I love when DJs do that to Aunt Nye. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone knows who they're talking about and they're too scared to even, you know, say  our names.  Yeah, man.  That guy is horrible.  Boy, that's some brave radio.  Ouch.  Yeah, you guys can go do me a favor.  Yeah.  Can you put on the Mike Tyson bit again?  Ah, yeah.  Come on, man.  We're trying to record this.  If we have a slow part of the show today, we'll do that, okay?  Can I say hi to my assistant, my brother?  You just did.  Okay.  All right, man.  All right.  Is that Christopher Reeve coming?  Ah, no.  All right.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:33:00]  Let's see.  Jeff's going to try to explain what Tubby Tom was saying last night.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing?  Good.  I got through to him.  I called him up and I was like, oh, I just want to tell you how much better you are than  O&A and they let me right through.  Yeah.  And when I got on, just when he was discussing how your ratings dropped.  Yeah.  So first thing out of my mouth was, well, no reason why yours don't drop is because you  don't have any to drop.  Yeah.  I was just, see?  They won't let me through if I, you know, if I say, oh, yeah, I like O&A and I want to 
[00:33:30]  rip on you.  Yeah.  I want to rip on him right away.  See, he takes this whole thing a little more seriously than we do.  We openly laughed at the speaker last night when he was talking to the whole country about  Opie and Anthony.  What a loser.  The only reason why I was talking about you guys is because you don't want to lose your  listeners and he wants, he knows we're going to listen so we can try to rip on him.  Well, you know, we've talked about him in the beginning when he first came to New York  and a lot of people checked him out because we started talking about him, but it didn't 
[00:34:00]  help in the ratings and it's going to happen again.  We'll fade away and stop talking about him again and his ratings will continue to be sucky.  I told him, I said, know who you're better than?  He goes, who?  I said, the morning show.  And he goes, oh, thanks.  I said, well, you know.  So I put, you know, and he started up in the morning when as soon as he came on going,  oh, I'm going to read off all the names that are ahead of me and he read off the Spanish  station.  Yeah.  And I told him, I said, you're right below the Spanish people. 
[00:34:30]  You know, there's only 1% of them around here.  All right, Jeff.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  Take care.  But there you go.  There's our cute little response, Tom.  That's it.  It's not going to be a three-hour infomercial, so.  Still number one, men, 25 to 44.  I know how important that is.  Don't you, Tom?  You know how important that is, right?  You would wish for that, wouldn't you?  You're never going to get it.  Ever, ever, ever.  Come on!  And I'll say it again.  Ant and I will outlast you in New York. 
[00:35:00]  We're up to 17 months.  You've got three under your belt.  Let's see how this one plays out, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let me laugh at you.  All right, Ant, let's start our real show now.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Got that out of the way.  Enough.  Ace all those tubby Tom calls.  We're not spending any more time talking about them.  That's it.  Goodbye.  We've got a good show today.  We've got Gary Conrad coming in, the hypnotist. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Are you going to try to be hypnotized today, Ant?  I'll sit in there and see if he can do it.  Why not?  Yeah.  Okay.  Who else is going to get hypnotized?  We've got to get Spaz again because he was priceless last time.  Oh, yeah, priceless.  Yeah, that was great.  Well, we've got to start by you.  What are you going for this time, an Emmy?  Come on.  We've got to start with you confronting Gary Conrad.  You don't believe in this.  Yeah, I don't believe it.  Sorry.  And you will attempt to get hypnotized today.  I'll take a stab at it.  We've got to get Psycho Mark to get hypnotized as well. 
[00:36:00]  Psycho Mark has basically said he'll do it.  All right, cool.  We've got a couple of listeners down, and I think we're going to have a good show, guys.  Thanks, Rick.  Good stuff.  I'm encouraged by that.  Good.  Rick says we're going to have a good show, Anthony.  Yeah.  Thank Christ.  Jesus.  Thanks, Gelman.  Gelman!  Sound like that.  Rick's like Gelman, just trying to get mic tied.  Guys are dicks. 
[00:36:30]  You're like Gelman.  I am not.  Yes, you are.  Where are the whores?  Or all of a sudden, Gelman has to say something and read it to Kathy Lee because he's trying  to get, like, freaking, you know, camera time.  Yeah, okay.  You got me.  What?  Gelman.  Time for our Millennium 2000 trivia contest.  Who wants to be a co-core?  All right.  Our fax line, 212-957-9.  Kathy Lee, you're knobs.  They're hanging like cowards. 
[00:37:00]  Wear a bra, for God's sake.  Gelman!  Get her a bra!  All right, and our fax line, 212-957-9639.  Phone line, 212-757-1027.  And it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for listening to the number one show with Ben, 25 to 44, Anthony.  That's right, Opie.  Let's not forget that fact.  It's an important fact, okay?  Yeah, they forget about it when they write in the paper. 
[00:37:30]  What did you learn on the show?  I'm a functioning idiot without a high school diploma.  Get a job on the radio.  Opie and Anthony.  The user of the mindless.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for tuning us in.  We appreciate it.  It's 1027 WNEW. 
[00:38:00]  Patiently waiting for Gary Conrad, the hypnotist, to make his way through the studio door, Anthony.  He's got his work cut out for him today.  Sure does.  Anthony has become a skeptic.  Yeah.  Just doesn't believe in it.  I'm amazed by that because I know that Rick or Spaz would have told us by now if they were faking it.  If they were acting.  If they were going along with the hypnotist.  And to this day, they swear they have no idea what was going on. 
[00:38:30]  I still don't buy it.  Even Rick said he was looking at the tape when he was under hypnosis and he couldn't believe the stuff he was doing.  Don't buy it.  What's in it for those guys?  I just don't believe it.  I don't know what's in it for them.  I think maybe they wanted to believe that they were hypnotized.  Maybe they were just acting for the show and now it went too far for him to say now that he was goofing. 
[00:39:00]  I don't know.  Talk to Rick Gilman.  Shut your ass.  Rick Gilman.  Yes, Anthony and Opie Lee.  You were indeed hypnotized, you say?  Anyway, so when you were acting like a child in the corner, you had no control over your body.  You all of a sudden were this child in the corner looking for a quarter or holding a quarter that Opie gave you in the corner.  You were completely out of effing control. 
[00:39:30]  If there was a fire in the building, you would have cowered in the corner like a child and died because you could not snap out of it and be an adult that you are.  I have no idea.  I mean, I don't know.  You can't say because the situation didn't happen, so you don't know how your body is going to react.  You couldn't at any point sit in that corner.  Nothing in your head went like.  Get up and walk away.  That would be a great test, though, to hypnotize someone to be a child and then all of a sudden, you know, you tell them there's a fire and they have to get out and see how they act. 
[00:40:00]  I ain't buying it.  Are you filming our show, Steve?  I'm not buying it because Rick also had that look on his face.  It's that I'm BSing look when he's trying to be serious.  No, it's not.  His mouth does something very distinct when he's lying.  I can tell when he's BSing every time.  No, it has nothing to do with that.  About that whole thing, I'm not sure.  All I can tell you, though, is that I remember the part where I couldn't curse and I had to do some Chinese crap.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  And I remember it a couple days later when we were talking about it, how frustrating it felt when I recalled that because I couldn't, it wouldn't come out of my mouth no matter how I wanted to talk.  So, now my argument, please.  Yes.  Look.  My argument, my argument is then how come there aren't more hypnotist criminals?  You know, hypnotize somebody to go into the bank and open the vault for you.  Okay.  Well, here's what he explained to us in the other room.  He says, if you're not going to be open to this, let me know because it's probably not going to take. 
[00:41:00]  You've got to be able to relax, be open to it, and just let him do his thing.  I mean, if you're going to sit there and go, well, you know, I really don't believe this crap.  I think I'm going to try and do it.  No.  I am going to do everything he tells me to do.  You have already been predisposed.  You've already told yourself you're not going to be hypnotized.  I'm a skeptic.  What can I say?  There's a level of trust that you've got to give the guy.  I'm not saying I'm not going to be hypnotized.  I'm saying give it your best shot.  I'm going to sit here and do everything you tell me to do, and we'll see what happens.  All right.  And I have another witness in the studio that happened to be here that day. 
[00:41:30]  Steve from the unofficial website came in to film it again today, and he saw what I saw.  Yes, I did.  He has nothing to gain or lose.  So, Steve.  Yeah.  What's your opinion on this?  My opinion?  Well, actually, the reason I'm videotaping Anthony right now and whatever he's saying is because  I want to do a before and after.  If it takes, I want to get this, this skeptic, you know, sort of response, and then I want  to get him bouncing around singing, I'm a little teapot. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  You know, I believe in hypnosis, but I got to tell you, I know my buddy Anthony is not going  to take with him.  If he's as unwilling as he sounds, it probably won't work.  Right.  So, anyone not willing to go along with it, it's not going to work.  What a gag that is.  What a racket that is.  Well, look, it's not going to work because you're not open to it.  Oh, I'm open to it.  Well, we'll have to ask Gary Conrad these questions.  We will. 
[00:42:30]  You know?  Yes, we will.  I'm sure he has an explanation.  He's probably been asked that before.  But, Steve, you saw what I saw.  How effed up was that?  What Rick and what Kevin were doing was so out of character for what they usually do.  Exactly.  So, why couldn't Rick just at any point, as he's acting like a child in the car, you mean  to tell me you are so effed up that you couldn't even, you couldn't even, that's worse than  any booze or drugs or anything.  Like, you could, you could do heroin and it'd be like, hey, Rick, what's up?  Hey, what's happening? 
[00:43:00]  You'd at least be, uh, yourself.  Okay.  This is more powerful than any narcotic on the face of the earth.  And, I have by mistake said stupid stuff in the office that has come back to bite me  on the air.  Why the hell would I voluntarily make myself look like an ass in front of you guys?  Because it's hypnosis.  There's nothing to gain.  I have nothing to gain.  Because it's hypnosis.  Then you just said that.  No, no, because it's, it's supposed to be hypnosis.  It's for the show.  It's whatever it is.  I don't know what you.  I don't like you guys that much. 
[00:43:30]  I still don't know what your intentions were during this whole thing.  What your, your whole thing, motivation was for doing that.  If you remember, I wasn't even going to do it.  But, Opie kind of pushed it on me because we were lacking a few people.  A few people backed out.  So, I was kind of a last minute, all right, I'll do it.  What the hell?  Well, all right.  I find it.  We've set the table here.  We'll see what Gary Conrad has to say.  Bill, what's going on?  Bill!  Hey, what's going on, man?  How are you guys doing today? 
[00:44:00]  Good.  You're live on the radio.  What's up?  Cool, man.  Listen, I almost asleep at the wheel here.  I know you guys were about the rating yesterday, but I'm wondering if you might be able to,  um, yeah, I hypnotized that man sitting in colostomy into having some personality or something.  Oh, my God.  I tried them guys this morning.  They're horrible.  So, maybe the hypnotist could help us get some, uh, ratings.  Well, that's what I'm thinking, man.  I don't know.  Take the two or three of their fans and, you know, hit them guys or something.  That's something to ask them, Bill.  Thank you.  Good luck, guys.  Take care.  All right. 
[00:44:30]  Bye.  Kevin Believes.  Kevin, you're next on NEW.  What's up, Believes?  Hey, guys.  I've been, uh, hypnotized and I've witnessed others be hypnotized, and I'm, I'm pretty sure  it's the real McCoy, man.  Nah.  Is there some kind of cult thing, Ant, that these people are coming out of the woodwork  to defend the hypnotist, or?  I don't know what it is.  Well, I'll tell you guys, I saw a guy hypnotize about 12 people when I was in high school,  and they were doing some pretty outlandish stuff, flipping, like, they, he said that  these guys were, uh, looking up at an airplane in the sky, and everybody was waving to him, 
[00:45:00]  flipping him the bird.  This one guy got up and mooned them all.  It's the real thing, man.  I'm telling you.  All right.  Thank you, Kevin.  All right.  Have a good one.  Bob from Freeport on the Instant Feedback.  Have them, uh, what word can we use?  We can't use the P word.  Have them urinate themselves.  That should prove it once and for all.  Because who would, who would do that? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  We might have to challenge Gary Conrad to, you know, make these guys do some just incredibly  outrageous, ridiculous things.  I, I, I don't know.  I'll, I'll agree to whatever he says.  I'll do, I'll go through the whole process there, and we'll see what happens, but very  skeptic.  Keith, what's going on?  It's not Keith, it's Pete.  But listen, here's the situation, all right?  Yeah.  This is why Anthony can't be hypnotized, and this is why Spaz is so easily hypnotized.  Spaz has no will. 
[00:46:00]  Okay?  If you have self-control, and you have your own state of mind, and you know it's in your  head, your thoughts, you control it.  Anthony has that kind of personality.  You can see when they talked about, remember when his buddy came over, I can't think of the  comedian from the Olive Garden, and they had to make the, it was the, uh, dan, dan,  dan, dan, they had the little spy cam coming down to the air shaft.  He's so technical, and he's so, he's so persistent that his body won't be hypnotized.  His mind won't be hypnotized.  That's his problem.  However, Spaz, where Spaz will do anything, anywhere, for example, lick a, lick a stained 
[00:46:30]  seat in front of other people, and then have Anthony admit in front of everybody that it  wasn't him with, you know.  And by the way, ask Spaz, Spaz, what is it?  Dude, put down the pipes.  Slow down.  I'm sorry, man.  I get excited when I talk to you guys in the front.  I love you.  You guys are great.  I think you touched on 10 different things in 30 seconds.  We lost you.  I might train his thought.  Aw.  Aw.  I'm still here, though.  But that's the point I was trying to make was, is that Anthony's not going to be hypnotized  because he has a strong will.  That's the problem.  It's all, it's all unconscious mind. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Well, we got a lot of questions to ask, Gary Conrad.  And one more thing.  Just one more thing.  Spaz, go.  I just asked Spaz, what does Anthony taste like?  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Jesus.  You know, I got a lot of email before the show, and they said that they can't really  hear what Anthony was confessing at the Super Bowl party.  Oh, really?  Because we bleeped out the F word.  Well, I'm just going to tell people, you know, that Anthony, in front of, I don't know,  over a thousand people said, I effed on that couch.  Yeah.  On the couch.  In the office. 
[00:47:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  Don, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  I've seen the hypnotized be done, and I don't believe it works.  It's just like they're all acting.  Yeah.  You know why I don't think it works, too?  Because it's bad acting.  You know, the normal run-of-the-mill person that you take off the street isn't a very good  actor, and they don't do very well under hypnosis either.  Well, obviously, there's limits.  I don't think you can hypnotize someone and make them into a brain surgeon or a good actor,  you know?  No, but they do. 
[00:48:00]  I think it has to be within their abilities, normally.  It's like, you know, a spaz, you're a hooker trying to get money out of Anthony.  And he's like, hey, baby.  It's just like bad acting.  Why would he do that, though?  For a goof.  For the show.  And then not fess up to it at this point?  It don't matter.  Why would he do that?  Goof.  Goof.  Goof.  So you're saying because he sounded like spaz, it wasn't believable?  No, because it was just bad acting.  Not because he sounded like spaz.  Who else is he going to sound like?  Are you thinking, because you think in cartoon terms of like Bugs Bunny, hypnotized, where 
[00:48:30]  it's over the top.  Me?  You guys are thinking that.  The lightning bolts coming out of the eyes into the head and all of a sudden he has no  control.  He's in the corner like an infant.  You're sad to hear.  You saw that.  I saw Rick acting badly as an infant in the corner.  That's what I saw.  Think of it as breaking down the walls of self-consciousness.  If all of us are thinking you're not opposed to doing any of this stuff, sure, you can  act like a baby.  I don't know. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know.  You could try to smooth it over with as much psychobabble as possible.  I ain't buying it.  Exactly.  That's why you won't be able to.  The thing that they did was so outlandish that you couldn't, you know, they might not  be able to do that on their own.  I think he just, I think Gary made it a lot easier for them to do that by making them,  he sat there for about 40 minutes and calmed them all down.  And what if, like, someone's hypnotized, I walk up to them, like, Rick's in the corner,  an infant, and I go, Rick, Rick, what are you, a jerk off?  Look at you.  You look like an ass.  Or try to make them laugh. 
[00:49:30]  Mm-hmm.  Now, I wish I would have done that, because I think I could have totally made them laugh  and broken them down.  Then maybe you shouldn't be hypnotized today, and you should try to mess with the people  that aren't hypnotized.  Oh, no.  You try to hypnotize me, goddammit.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good.  When I was in high school, we had a guy named Amazing Neal on our senior trip.  We had about 400 people in the senior class.  He said, anybody who wants to try it, get up.  Probably about 30 people got up.  I was one of them.  I was a little bit of a skeptic.  He said, if it doesn't work after the first five minutes, you know it's not working. 
[00:50:00]  And out of about 30 people, about 10 people sat down.  He had the shyest kid in our senior class making out with a microphone stand.  I'm telling you, what happened?  Some people worked.  I went up there a little skeptic.  And, you know, he had people, you know, dirty dancing, guys and girls laying on each other  that wouldn't have touched each other sober.  Yeah, I've seen all that before.  I truly believe this stuff.  Thank you, Chris.  You guys suck.  All right.  Joe Soprano checking in from the Bronx.  I would like to see Gary hypnotize one of the guys, namely Psycho Mark, to pick a booger 
[00:50:30]  and eat it.  That's lovely.  I'd like to see that.  I hope this backfires on your ass, Ant.  I hope you go under like that.  He's not, if I do, dancing a jig or something.  If I do, God bless him.  He's an amazing man.  Let me go on record.  Fine.  Let me go on record.  I believe in this hypnosis thing.  Yeah.  There's no way Ant's going under.  We'll see.  We will see what happens.  I don't want to look foolish later.  There's no way he's going to go under. 
[00:51:00]  See what happens, man.  You never know.  You're going to be able to let go and trust him and just go with it and see what happens.  Obi, I promise you, I will do everything he says.  I will relax.  I will close my eyes.  I'll deep breathe.  Whatever the hell he wants me to do, I will do.  Okay.  I will clear my mind.  I won't sit there making jokes and goofing.  I will go through everything the way he wants me to go through it.  Okay.  Very good.  And we'll see what happens.  That's all I'm saying.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  Yes.  You're listening to the number one show with men, 25 to 44. 
[00:51:30]  No one else wants to talk about that, so we better toot our own horns.  Because everyone else wants to make us look like losers in the paper and on the Internet today.  So we'll say it.  We'll say it.  Oh, listen to the lineup promo.  Who's missing?  Obi and Anthony afternoons.  Mason and Kalinke more out.  The Radio Chick Middays.  On 1027 WNAW. 
[00:52:00]  1027 WNAW.  It's Obi and Anthony.  Hey.  Who's who stopped by to say hi today, Anthony?  Hi, Beal.  Cowbell Beal.  Hi, Beal.  Hey.  Hasn't been on the show in a while?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, Bill, you haven't seen your buddy Anthony in a while?  Are you digging his new clothes?  Ooh, look at that.  There must be somebody new in your life.  Bill, at least there's new clothes. 
[00:52:30]  Because I can't get my old one.  You know, she took everything, man.  The clothes are gone.  God.  I took one little batch of clothing.  That was it?  Your computer and ran?  Yeah, like my computer and a few clothes and stuff.  I thought I'd be able to go back and get the rest of my clothing.  No.  Well, the phone rang today in the office.  Uh-oh.  Rick picks it up.  Do I ever pick up my effing telephone in the office? 
[00:53:00]  Ever, ever, ever.  Never, ever, ever.  Do I ever?  I mean, we're in meetings.  The phone's ringing.  I'm like, I don't care.  I'm not picking up the phone.  I don't pick it up.  Why did I pick up the phone?  Because you thought it was the hard rock calling back to bring us lunch or something.  But why would they have my phone number?  Because I gave them an extension.  Why did you give them my extension knowing I never answered the phone?  Because you were on Colby's extension doing an interview.  I explained this to you.  Regardless of how it happened, I never answered the phone.  Rick answered the phone.  It goes, oops, I guess I shouldn't answer that. 
[00:53:30]  Oh.  So now, uh, I picked the phone up.  It's the future ex.  Oops.  And, uh, and what's your, you know, talking about a couple of finances and things like that, you know?  Some issues. 
[00:54:00]  Some issues.  Sure.  So I bring up the point that I'd like to come by maybe and get the rest of my clothes at some point.  Seems that, um, seems they somehow made their way into goodwill.  Our own Ziggy that we had on this show is probably wearing some of my shirts.  I can get some clothes.  Yeah.  Seems my clothes are, uh, bagged up and shipped out. 
[00:54:30]  Great.  The goodwill.  Yeah, we could have at least auctioned them off on the show.  Yeah.  Hey, some?  I want to have your defense fund.  You can't believe it.  It's like, oh, yeah, come by and get some of my clothes.  Oh, clothes?  I don't know any more rules.  It's underwear.  $4.95.  Yeah.  Seems, uh, seems the clothing is not an issue anymore. 
[00:55:00]  Don't feel bad, Ann.  I had a friend of mine show up at a club one night wearing his work boots covered with tall, dress slacks, and the vest for the dress slacks.  No shirt.  I look at him.  I look at him.  I go, Chip, what happened?  Yo, Billy, man, she took everything.  Just the best dress pants and crappy, encrusted boots. 
[00:55:30]  She took it with a big ass hairy chest with just the vest on.  Hang out.  And he had to go down to the bar.  He had to go.  Had nowhere else to go.  Put the vest on.  I go, yeah, this worked, man.  Yeah, this looked good.  Yo, Billy, man, how'd I look?  Friggin' Chip, man.  Chip.  Chip.  Yo, Billy, man.  Yo, Billy, man.  The best part of this story, Ann went back to his place. 
[00:56:00]  We've talked about it on the air, so I guess we can bring it up again.  Yeah, I had to get my computer equipment.  But, see, at that point, you had a chance to get your clothes.  It just shows you how much you really like your computer.  Well, I only had a limited time.  Because at that point.  Limited window of opportunity.  Because I've got to say something.  At that point, you didn't start shopping for new clothes.  I mean, your jeans were starting to smell.  Of course, smell.  Now, first of all, you know, screw you. 
[00:56:30]  Because, first of all, it isn't like that.  Don't walk back to my life.  I have clean clothes and showers.  Yes.  What are you talking about?  I'm just messing with you.  Holy smokes.  No, I took all the clothing that I needed.  There were just other things that, you know, you have in your closet that you don't wear that often.  You know?  Speaking of that window of opportunity, how did you get in there? 
[00:57:00]  Through the window of opportunity.  Well, yeah.  No, because I was thinking in my head, based on previous things that had happened.  You know, I won't go into any details.  I was under the assumption that if I went and knocked on the door and she was home,  that I wouldn't have been able to get in to get my computer equipment.  So I opted to take the other chance, which is to just let myself in, let's say, 
[00:57:30]  to the house that I was paying rent on anyway.  Can you picture that?  That was me.  Isn't that that famous radio guy's butt hanging out?  I was hanging down from cables through the roof,  trying not to set off the floor alarm.  I was hovering over it and a little bead of sweat fell off my forehead.  It almost hit the floor.  But it landed on my arm, I think. 
[00:58:00]  Here's your computer equipment.  Let me just pop the disc out.  Oh, I got to get my porn.  God knows what kind of trouble that can make for me in a court of law.  Yeah, I wasn't concerned more with my computer equipment than what was on that hard drive.  How fast can I reformat this thing?  Sink me for sure.  Yes, must reformat hard drive.  Now, so I reclaimed my computer equipment. 
[00:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  And now all that was over there that I figured I would go by at some point and pick up  was my clothes, which is goodwill.  I still don't know the fate of my radio control helicopter.  Something tells me, yeah, same fate as the old NBC traffic chopper.  Same fate just as well as Stevie Ray's chopper, I do believe. 
[00:59:00]  What else, man?  What about that great mountain bike we got?  No, I got that.  You got that?  I got that when I went to get my computer.  I strapped that to the roof.  Yeah, that's how I made my getaway on the mountain bike.  I asked Rick to borrow his mountain biking pants.  And I strapped everything to my back.  Well, look at the bright side.  There's some poor, unfortunate kid with a brand-new helicopter flying around  with an FN Talk at 1027 t-shirt. 
[00:59:30]  Jesus Christ.  We should have a new contest.  Spot Anthony's clothes on the street.  If you find any of my clothing, yeah, let me know.  It would be some, let's see, WAAF Boston shirts that might turn up.  Some AEW stuff.  Some beer and liquor t-shirts.  Plenty of Budweiser clothing. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, and I got my golf clubs too there, Bill.  Oh, do you?  We could still play some golf.  I love your priorities.  It's great.  Computer, mountain bike.  Toys.  Right.  The clothing was just like an afterthought of what I threw on top of the golf clubs.  PJ, what's going on?  Damn it.  PJ.  Did we lose PJ?  PJ.  No.  PJ.  Okay.  PJ. 
[01:00:30]  No.  He had a good one, too.  There's nothing else there.  Okay.  Oh.  Well, that's very funny, Anthony.  Yeah.  Tragic, but funny.  Well, you know, it's, uh, it's life, O'Brien.  You left with more than I did.  Corky Anthony.  Corky Anthony.  What were you saying, Bill?  Yeah, Bill.  You left with more than I did.  Yeah.  You know.  Bill kind of went through a situation. 
[01:01:00]  It happened to be summer.  All I had was shorts and a t-shirt.  And you got, uh, Bill, what?  Wiped out.  Everything wiped out.  Can you retell the story?  That's one of the funniest stories ever.  Ever.  Cute little story.  You know, I had a story about how my, uh, last, uh, couple of weeks ago, my love life  hit rock bottom.  A couple of weeks ago?  You want me to tell this story on top of that story?  A couple of weeks ago something happened? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Your love life hit the rock bottom.  Look, he's, look, he's all, look at his face.  What happened?  It's embarrassing.  I didn't hear about this one.  It's pretty embarrassing.  What happened?  It's, it's, uh, well, there's two stories in one, actually.  I'm at the local watering hole, Peppers.  Sure.  And, uh, Friday afternoon, happy hour.  I usually hang for a couple hours and I go home.  That was the deal.  I was ready to go home.  In walks the nerdiest looking guy you've ever seen in your life.  I'm talking crew cut, Coke bottle glasses, you know.  The pencil's in his top pocket. 
[01:02:00]  Sits down, orders eight shots.  I'm like, oh, this guy isn't with anybody.  Right?  Bangs all eight shots.  Tequila, I think.  So I said, you know, I gotta hang out and watch this.  You wanted to go home, but.  You know, I mean, talk about out of his element.  Right.  Picture the front row at a Rolling Stones concert.  Right?  1969.  The camera's panning across the front row.  Bikers, hippies, and all of a sudden there's Pee Wee Herman.  That's where this guy. 
[01:02:30]  That's where this guy.  So he looks at me and goes, hey, you want to do a Dr. Pepper?  I'm like, what the hell is that?  You drop a shot in a Guinness or whatever?  That's a Huntington drink all the way.  You know, I did one.  I'm like, you know, that's not bad.  He's buying them.  Yeah.  I'm like, okay.  And I'm banging them.  I'm like, this is pretty good.  The last thing I remember was saying, I don't think I should drive home.  Right?  That was the last thing I remember.  I woke up Saturday morning.  Now, you know how water beds work? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  You know, water displacement, buoyancy.  Sure.  Normally, my alarm clock is right at eye level.  Right?  I wake up.  I'm like, why am I looking down at my alarm clock?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  That meant somebody was on the other side pushing down on that bed, thus lifting you up  a little more than you're used to.  270 pounds worth.  Oh, my God.  Where did you find him?  What the hell?  You don't even remember?  No.  No. 
[01:03:30]  The last thing I remember was saying, I think I should get a ride home.  And you ended up with a chick that was 270 pounds?  At least.  Were you hypnotized?  At least.  I was hypnotized.  Oh, my God.  Now, I got up and I said, you got to go.  You have to go.  Before any of my pals come over.  I never let it down.  Oh, it's too late now.  You know, I went back to the bar the next day to get my car.  The whole place was looking at me like, are you nuts? 
[01:04:00]  I'm like, you know.  Bill's nailed some pretty quality tail in his day, too, you know?  Like, it's his reputation.  He walks out with a hammer.  It's like, whoa.  He's slumming tonight.  I think that heifer carried me out.  Put me in her back pocket and took me home.  Oh, man.  So, anyway, I said, they said, you know the guy that was buying you those Dr. Peppers?  I said, yeah.  They said, the paramedics had to show up.  Pick him out on a stretcher.  That's a good night. 
[01:04:30]  You were the lucky one, I guess, huh?  Yeah, all-time low.  All-time low.  That's a good story, too.  You've been better off on the stretcher.  Yeah, I know.  I would have been.  Too funny.  All right, we've got to take a quick break here.  Waiting for Gary Conrad to show up to hit the test.  A lot of good phone calls on hold.  You guys stay there.  We'll go to you next.  1027-WNEW. 
[01:05:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sitting in today, Cowbell Bill.  Get up.  We love Cowbell Bill stories.  He hasn't been here in a while.  How do you?  Steve from the unofficial website hanging out.  Bill from the old neighborhood.  I haven't been out there in a while.  How is it out on the island?  I know.  We wish you out there.  You've been out there quite some time there, Bill.  Give Bill some headphones, please.  Let's go to the phones here, Anthony.  Tom, you're next on N.E.W. 
[01:05:30]  What's up?  Hey, O.N., how are you guys doing?  Hey, we're doing all right.  I just jumped in.  I hear Anthony telling that story about going home and getting his computer out.  It reminded me a month ago, my wife probably been having trouble,  and she got me restrained or I can't go in the house.  So I'm talking out.  I've got no clothes.  I've got nothing to do.  I'm walking around the block.  I'm waiting for her to leave the house.  I break into the house.  I feel like such a criminal going in the house.  I'm creeping around, making sure nobody's watching me.  I get my clothes.  I get home.  She cut all the buttons and all the pockets out of all my clothes. 
[01:06:00]  I got home.  I put my pants on.  I stick my hands in my pockets.  There's no pockets in my pants.  Nothing at all.  I don't know if that happened to you, but jeez.  Cut the buttons and the pockets out.  Cut the buttons off my shorts.  All my good shorts, no buttons.  Yeah.  It's in my pants, no pockets.  Man.  I put them all out.  So she must know I was coming back.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Well, no.  Before you leave it, Tom Likas, his show couldn't beat that Saturday morning health show you guys got.  Tom Likas. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know who he is, but thank you.  Thanks for the call.  Mariah, what's going on?  Sophie and Anthony?  Yeah, you're next.  Hi, guys.  I just wanted to tell Anthony I could definitely relate to that because when my marriage broke up,  I got the three guys in the truck to move me, and I had to wait until my husband left.  And I had to help them move because we had to move that fast.  So here's the three guys and me moving the furniture out.  They had a two-hour window.  So I could definitely relate to having to be out in a hurry. 
[01:07:00]  The three guys have anything to do with your marriage?  No, it had nothing to do with it.  Actually, Anthony, it was like I had a husband that didn't want to work,  and I was working three jobs while he was banging somebody in the house.  So that's why I left.  Rock.  Hey, I can relate to that.  Thank you, Mariah.  You're welcome.  Bill, you're going to tell the other story or what?  You've told it before, but it's a killer.  Bill had a gig.  Well, you know, just like that girl said, you know, I'm working my butt off.  You know, I'm sending my wife to school to become an RN, paying for the house, 
[01:07:30]  and she finally gets a job as an RN.  I can't look.  Starts banging the doctor.  Oh, man.  It's still hard to swallow.  Turns out to be my best friend's second cousin.  Yeah.  So, you know, I said to him, I'm like, hey, you know, what's the deal with this guy?  He's like, oh, he bangs all the nurses.  Oh, just give it up.  Yeah.  Great.  Great.  So, I basically, you know, got booted out of the house, took everything, left me with nothing. 
[01:08:00]  And, you know, my mother's saying, well, don't worry, honey.  What goes around comes around.  I'm like, yeah, ma, right.  You know?  You know, there's no way this is ever going to even out.  A couple of years later, I hear from my best friend that the guy gets in an accident with  his jaguar, bites off his tongue.  And they can't find it. 
[01:08:30]  So, I figured I'd give him a jingle.  You called him up?  I called him up.  Remember me?  Cat got your tongue?  Dick.  Wow.  I asked my wife, how's that feel?  It's like nothing.  He's giving you a little stub. 
[01:09:00]  I love that story.  Wow.  True story.  Sue, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  Great.  I just have a drinking story for you guys.  Drinking story?  Yeah.  How did we get there?  Well, you were talking about drinking.  Yeah.  I was talking about drinking.  I just figured you'd want to hear a drinking story about my husband and I.  Sure.  Why not?  We were out partying with a bunch of friends.  Went to their house.  Wind up being, you know, permissuous.  And we're skinny dipping.  Wind up getting totally ossified. 
[01:09:30]  We happened to be up the street.  Drove home.  Threw up in the driveway, my husband and I.  He dragged me.  He could only drag me into the garage.  And we wind up sleeping naked on the garage floor.  And my children had to cover us up.  Oh, Jesus.  Thirteen years old and thirteen years old were taking care of mom and dad, drunk and sleeping  on the garage floor.  That's a sight they'll never, ever forget.  You know what?  I hope that they kind of got something out of it. 
[01:10:00]  Of course, we didn't get much out of it, but...  That'll screw you up for life.  It was hysterical.  Sitting your parents drunk and naked in the garage.  It's a famous neighborhood store.  Oh, you taste like antifreeze.  But you know, it's totally embarrassing to have your kids taking care of you when you're  ossified and naked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Aw, you screwed them up.  That's it.  Yeah.  I mean, they kind of rigged us for a while over it.  You ever catch one of those little, like, inadvertent down-the-shirt looks at your mom or something? 
[01:10:30]  Like, she goes to bend over or something.  You just turn and look.  You're like, oh, God.  I just saw my mom's boo.  You're like, oh, son of a bitch.  I was 12 years old.  Yeah.  Kutchog.  That exact thing.  Same thing.  You see, I think everyone's had it happen.  Yeah.  It happens.  You're like, oh, God.  They're like, effed you up for a while, you know?  You don't want to think about that.  You don't think...  You don't want to think that your mom's fat.  Yeah.  It's birthed in your head, you know?  Swing and boob. 
[01:11:00]  You're like, oh, God, come on.  Come on, Ma.  Mike.  Yo, what's up, O&A?  I got a story for Bill there.  You want to talk about fat broads in the bed.  One time...  Not really, but go ahead.  Listen, I'm in the ball one day.  I'm 6'4", like 325, right?  I'm hanging out.  I wake up the next morning.  I look over.  There's this cow that's the size of a frigging couch with legs.  Sitting there.  She's about 4'11", 250 pounds, and just a big slob.  I'm looking at her like, holy Christ, what the hell did I do? 
[01:11:30]  I got a girlfriend at home that looks way better than this.  I'm like, oh, Jesus, what am I going to do?  So I look over.  I look again.  I scrolled.  Let me throw another one in it.  So I'm over there.  Whoa.  I push her legs up.  It's like you ever pull on like a branch on a tree and it snaps back?  The Lord has these legs, like big rubber cow legs.  I'm banging this thing.  Her stomach is flowing like two water beds, right?  I'm like, oh, my God, what's going on?  I get up.  I finish my thing.  I said, hey, see you later.  She had like a $40 cab ride.  I said, yeah, good luck. 
[01:12:00]  I'll catch you later.  Good luck.  Well, I have to say, I had my jeans and sneakers on.  You know, that's the first.  I looked at my sneakers.  I was like.  Not for nothing.  Fat broads are the key to happiness, though.  Four in the morning.  You're sitting there drinking all night.  There's going to be one slop sitting on a bar.  Oh, man, Mike.  You're like, hey, you know what?  If you go home with me, you're going to go home and pick crumbs out of the couch again.  Fat.  Don't quit.  Oh, my God. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, you've all been there, so don't deny it.  Wow.  Don't deny it, because they'll do things nobody else will do, like, do you mind if I put this  there?  Really?  Can my friend put that there, too?  All right.  Can I put this remote in there?  Oh, actually.  Did you ever see one try and get out of a waterbed?  Say that again, Bill.  Did you ever see one try and get out of a waterbed?  No.  No, no.  That's a frightening fact.  It takes like 15, 20 minutes.  There's stuff rolling all over the place.  You jump on one try, Bill, and the fat board just rolls out the other side. 
[01:13:00]  That's how you wake her up.  You wake her up.  I might get caught underneath there.  In the kitchen, make me something, because I know you know how to cook, you fat slob.  It sounds like you have a lot of experience with this, Mike.  Oh, yeah.  I like to go hogging now and then.  All right.  Good luck, fellas.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks for the while.  You've got to roll a fat one.  With that, let's play a couple tunes.  We'll be back.  Maybe Gary Conrad got scared.  Maybe.  Because you want to confront him today. 
[01:13:30]  He hasn't shown up yet.  Foo Fighters.  Everlong.  David Grohl arrested for driving drunk on a moped.  On a moped.  Way to go, Dave.  It's 1027-W-A-W.  Opie.  You scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such a demonic little bastard?  1027-W-A-W. 
[01:14:00]  Caitlin.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Caitlin.  How old are you, Caitlin?  I'm 28 now.  Man, you're a little old to have the name Caitlin.  I thought that was one of those popular names that only hit, like, in 1990.  Well, I'm sorry.  Caitlin is like the Gertrude of the Roaring Twenties.  Gertie.  Oh, Gertie, you know?  Hey, Gertie.  Back in the Roaring Twenties, I bet, you know, Gertrude was a great name for women and little  girls, but Mildred.  But you just don't see that name anymore. 
[01:14:30]  Caitlin is the same thing.  Eventually, it's going to run its course, I think.  Ethel.  Men find Caitlin very cute.  Well, yeah, but there was a time Ethel was a great name.  Ethel's a hot number, Rick.  I gave her quite a banging last night.  And Bertha, you know, those names all were cute in their day, too.  Like, yeah, those were all hot.  Like, back in the day, it was like, hey, man, did you see Bertha?  Yeah, I'd like to bang Bertha. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah, look at Gertrude.  What are some of those other names from the past?  From the Roaring Twenties?  There was Gertrude, there was Bertha.  Oh, Abigail.  Mildred, Abigail's a good one.  There was Hortense.  What?  Hortense.  There was Judy.  Hortense?  Hortense.  Maybe in your neighborhood.  Hortense.  That was a name.  That was a name.  Hortense.  I don't remember any Hortense.  Harriet.  Harriet's in the middle one.  Harriet's used to be hot.  Harriet.  Can you imagine a hot broad today walking around the streets of Manhattan and her name's Harriet? 
[01:15:30]  Imagine banging an Agnes.  Agnes.  Banging an Agnes.  So, like, I got Penelope doggy style.  But, see, like, Caitlin works, you know, you're sitting there.  Yeah, yeah, Caitlin, right.  There were probably some jocks in the 20s, like, you know, talking dirty to a Gertrude.  That rocked.  Oh, that's cool.  Not like a Thelma or an Eleanor.  Right.  Eleanor.  There's an Eleanor.  Oh, man.  Who would ever name their kid Eleanor after... 
[01:16:00]  Where's Eleanor?  Eleanor Roosevelt.  Yeah, after seeing that mug.  Eleanor is now, like, a lesbian name, I believe.  You ain't had it till Winifred to hand down your pants.  They'd call her Freddy for sure.  Hey, Freddy.  Freddy.  Hey, Barney.  What about Hillary?  Hillary used to be...  Yeah, that's an old name.  Yeah, not as old as, like, a Bertha or a Gertrude or an Abigail.  Gertrude.  A Harriet.  Harriet.  Oh, man. 
[01:16:30]  When I got Harriet.  Yeah.  Had a bite of hair going, yeah, Harriet.  You do it.  A Eunice.  Eunice.  Eunice is another one.  I'm going to take you like Hitler took Poland.  A lot of fight.  23's canoe, you bitch.  Hubba hubba.  Heard of the Roaring 20s.  I'm going to show you the Roaring 69, Hildegard.  Come here.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussy.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you want in on the show today.  Cowbell Bill hanging out, telling some of his stories today.  We always like it when Bill stops by.  Bill, good friend of the shop.  Fax line 2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9.  And if you want to send a hate email, you're allowed to do that as well. 
[01:17:30]  Because it gets filtered to us, and then we read them, and then we get to laugh real hard.  Yeah, we don't care.  Let her rip.  Dear WNEW,  I've been an NEW listener since 1968.  Wait, wait, when did this come in?  This sounds like one of those, the beginning of one of those we used to get when we first got here.  Oh, I know.  No, this is, uh, no, it came in today.  Huh.  All right.  Actually, right after yesterday's show.  So they couldn't wait to get this in the boss's hand.  Okay.  Dear WNEW, I've been an NEW listener since 1968. 
[01:18:00]  Groovy.  And I was never as appalled by anyone in radio as I was by the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you.  We like that.  Never as appalled when they were playing recordings of Kirk Douglas' voice and ridiculing him.  Were we ridiculing him or just pointing out how, uh, how bad life is?  How tragic.  Tragic.  All of a sudden this guy was a strong guy, actor, ladies' man, Hollywood.  You see Spartacus, you know? 
[01:18:30]  Spartacus.  Look at you, Spartacus.  You're freaking beautiful.  So, and then, uh, you know, you tack on a few years and you get the, the, the guy he  is now, you know?  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Well, he was, um, talking the other day about his son having another kid.  His 57 year old son having another kid.  Yeah.  That's not too selfish.  With Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Would you like to hear the clip again, Ann, before we move on with our hate mail? 
[01:19:00]  All right.  I said, Catherine, okay.  Hey, I'm very happy for both of you because I want more grandchildren.  I only have three grandkids.  Oh, poor guy.  Hey, call me.  My name is Kurt.  It's really sad.  Isn't it?  But, but what, what was this guy's problem?  That we played it?  I got to interrupt, interrupt our hate mail.  Another radio station talking about us. 
[01:19:30]  Everyone likes talking about the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Darren, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Open in.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing all right.  All right.  I'm a long time listener.  About a year now.  You guys kick ass.  Thank you.  Anthony, when you did that Tyson thing the other day, I literally pulled over and cried.  Yes, I try to make people weep.  Could be the best thing Anthony has ever done.  Wow.  I think it was, Anthony.  I absolutely think it was.  Nice.  I got to be honest.  Great.  I got to be honest.  When you guys go to commercials, once in a while, I'll turn on K-Rod or, I'm sorry, 
[01:20:00]  that other radio station.  No, you can say it.  I don't care.  There's nowhere else to really go for music.  We understand.  I find it funny that people, you know, make believe they don't turn away when the commercials  come on.  Okay.  That's what you do when you're listening to radio.  You listen to some commercials, and then you see what else is out there.  What the hell do you think we do on the drive home?  Listen to Tubby Tom?  I thought you listened to, hey, Maggie.  I'm Kane, I guess.  Listening to some music on K-Rod.  Yes.  The only good thing about you guys, other than Howard, is at least your commercials are 
[01:20:30]  a minute long, not 30 minutes long.  Anyway, so I turned on the upstation, and Pandarvis says,  he says,  John Rocker is to baseball as those two other guys, those two other DJs, are to radio.  Those two other DJs.  Those two other DJs.  And he said it like three times in a row.  Wow.  And before he plays the song, he goes,  Well, I think you guys know who I'm talking about.  Yeah.  And if you don't know who I'm talking about, maybe you can give me a call,  and I'll explain this a little. 
[01:21:00]  So I should call them.  If you guys have three-way, let me call him on the line.  Darren, don't even bother.  Yeah, he doesn't even work there.  That's what I'm doing, bro.  Don't even bother.  He's doing that because he is just trying to get us to talk about him.  That's all.  I'm surprised he had time to say anything in between those 92-minute rock blacks.  You know, they don't let him talk about it.  That's got to make you feel so good as a jock, knowing that you got hired,  and your PD just tells you, look, play a lot of music and don't talk a lot. 
[01:21:30]  But I want to showcase my talent here.  I got K-Rock.  Can I have to?  No, no, no.  Look, look, look.  Play the rock songs.  You can intro like another 92-minute rock block that's coming up,  but please don't talk much.  I, like for the first couple of months, not talk too much.  I can do that.  No, no, no.  No, Will.  Ever.  Ever.  Like Opie and Anthony, they're allowed, you know, pretty much speak their mind.  Whatever they want to talk about, they can talk about.  If, you know, you want to deem that being the John Rockers, well, whatever. 
[01:22:00]  You know, we're just talking.  We let people get on the phones, talk about what they want to talk about.  That's how this show works.  But for you, I just want to, you know, maybe in between the rock black,  maybe talk about, no, no, no, Will.  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.  You are an heir, no personality.  That's it.  Just seg the songs.  All right, but what if I, no, seg the songs.  Yeah, but in between, they're going to, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, Will, Will, Will, Will, Will. 
[01:22:30]  You're not understanding me.  We love what you do.  We loved your tape.  We hired you.  We really feel that you are a talent.  Can I interject here?  Yeah.  Did Steve Kingston have, like, cotton in his ears that day when he was listening to that audition tape?  We just love the way you said 92.  You know, and fitting it into the rock block thing is just brilliant,  And we really love how you say the word rock.  Rock.  Rock.  It's never been said that way in New York before. 
[01:23:00]  I could go with that for a while, but maybe I could...  Easy, easy.  Don't get excited.  Calm yourself.  That's got to suck.  You get a job at radio and you're just checking to.  If you're a DJ and you get a job where your main thing is 92-minute rock blocks,  that's pretty sad.  Coming up in an hour and a half, got some Rage Against the Machine. 
[01:23:30]  That's just got to be great.  Make no mistake.  If you get into radio, you want to be able to talk, to express yourself,  to have a show based on your ideas and the ideas of your callers,  have something interesting going on on a daily basis,  that is the dream of anybody on the radio.  If they're telling the weather, if they're doing traffic, 
[01:24:00]  if they're saying 92-minute rock blocks,  the ultimate goal is to talk.  Bob, it ain't happening over there.  Shut her down.  Yeah, I could see Kingston saying that too well.  Your talent, it shines through the music.  You know?  I mean, when a 92-minute rock block is playing,  people know that behind that music, you're sitting pushing those buttons, 
[01:24:30]  starting the CDs, stopping them, playing the commercials,  putting the CDs away.  They know that's you.  That's your talent.  Yeah, it is, isn't it?  Bob, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Bob, you're on the radio.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Listen, I just want to say one thing.  By giving this nut juggler time on your show,  all you're going to do is help them out, 
[01:25:00]  because the more you talk about him, the more you're going to help him.  The only time mentioning somebody's name helps them out is if they're any good.  Yeah, if they can back it up with talent.  Because then a lot of our listeners will go over there,  and then they'll hear this rock block thing.  Rock block.  And then they come right back to us.  They come up here.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  It's temporary ratings for him.  It's when people don't mention the names,  that they're a little afraid that they might send people over there,  and then they'll listen and say, hey, wow, that's pretty fun or interesting or whatever.  Good.  Well, I just want to say one quick thing. 
[01:25:30]  I just started listening to you guys about three, four weeks ago,  and I think the thing that separates you guys from everybody else is when calls, call up.  You treat them like, you know, good people.  I used the F word, LP.  I apologize.  We had a dope out of that.  Because sometimes we do things just for our own entertainment.  Bobby Diamond, baby.  All right.  Take it easy, man.  Thank you, Bob.  I got a little rambunctious. 
[01:26:00]  I said, ask you to the guy.  I think you feel threatened by Will, and you're just losing.  Maybe that's it.  I want to play a rack, boy.  You know, we could be one better than him and do a 93-minute rack.  It's one more better.  Do you think, like, when the ratings come out,  and if, like, that date part goes up that he really thinks it's because of him?  Yeah, yeah, that's the funny thing, too.  Do you think he's, like, calling the PD and stuff and going, hey, how was my rating?  Let me paw through the numbers here.  Let me crunch some numbers. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, look at that.  I went up, like, wow, a fraction.  But, hey, I went up.  After because of the way I say a rack, black, in reality, he went down.  Yeah, he did.  So, not terrible.  It's the music.  But then if it goes down, he could say, well, it's the music.  It's the music.  Hey, boss, you ready for the music you're giving me?  I can't play a rack, black with this music.  My rating's going down.  Keith, you're next on the radio show.  Hey, I hope you need to be.  Yeah, earlier you were saying how old. 
[01:27:00]  Wait, how old are you, Keith?  Twelve.  Oh, okay.  It's so funny when you read up on there that he has a story about when he was twelve.  Oh, yeah.  And then it, like, just happened.  Then you realize he is twelve.  He is twelve.  I thought it was a 30-year-old guy that was going to, you know, tell us the story of when he was twelve.  But it's actually a 12-year-old talking about when he was twelve.  Yeah?  You realize kids your age over in Taiwan are, like, smoking bots and firing machine guns and taking over countries and stuff? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  You see that in the news?  They're chain-smoking.  What are those two kids' names?  They're, like, twins?  Wang and Wang.  Wang and Wang.  Wang and Wang.  They're twelve-year-olds.  They puff bots and, like, shoot up stuff.  How sad is your country that you can't, like, you know...  Because you can't crush a rebellion of a twelve-year-old life.  That's hysterical.  Throw some porn at them.  They'll stop instantly.  How sad is that?  Go ahead, Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, well, you're saying how horrible it's to see your mom's boobs. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, if you inadvertently see your mom's boobs.  What?  Seeing your mom and dad do commando on the bed.  Commando?  What happened, Keith?  Oh, God.  I tried to forget it.  What happened?  You walked in on them?  Oh, yeah.  Early Saturday morning.  You opened...  You just flung the door open?  Opened it.  Was Mom taking it from behind, or what?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, what was happening?  Yeah, what position were they in, Keith? 
[01:28:30]  Feet over their shoulders.  Wow.  That's the hi-hi you doing.  Is your dad hung?  Huh?  Oh.  Is your dad hung?  I don't know.  But, like, were they making noise or anything?  It was pretty embarrassing, huh?  My mom's a professional.  She was moaning, huh?  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  And then what happened when they saw you? 
[01:29:00]  Their back was kind of facing to me, so I managed to get out.  Oh, they didn't see you?  They didn't ask you to join them?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, man, you got...  Who are you, Rick, today?  Taking it too far?  I took a hit on the head this morning, and I'm terrible.  Think I'm spaz?  Hey, this kid's quick.  Even 12-year-olds think they're fun spaz.  So, did you enjoy it?  I mean, was that the first time you've ever seen, you know, people having sex?  Oh, yeah, I guess. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, that sounds awful.  You'll remember that for the rest of your life.  Yeah.  Has your dad told you about the birds and the bees yet?  Actually, my brother did.  What did he tell you?  Well, it started with this question, what hole does he go into?  So, my father said, whatever, one's open.  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:00]  Is your dad's name Jackie?  No, not that one.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Keith, you're all right, man.  I mean, I guess you'll do okay.  All right.  Anything else?  Rather not say.  Okay.  You guys suck.  All right.  So does your mom, Keith. 
[01:30:30]  Call back any time, all right?  Okay.  All right.  There he goes.  Keith, everyone.  He's pretty funny.  He's very funny.  Funny little lad.  Chris, you're next on the radio show.  Come on, Opie.  That was great.  That is so wrong, man.  It was wrong on many levels.  I apologize.  I got hit on the head really bad today.  Yeah, you did.  That was great.  My noggin is all messed up.  I think you got a conclusion at the brain.  Oh, man.  You're killing me here, bro. 
[01:31:00]  All right, Chris.  Thank you, Chris.  I agree with you.  That was totally out of frigging place there, Opie.  I know.  I know.  Jeez, man.  I'm not thinking right today at all.  Vinny.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Vinny?  Hey, this is racist, Vinny.  I don't want to be known as Vinny the racist, but...  Oops, too late.  Jesus Christ.  You know, this guy, this Will Pentarvis, whatever his name is, I never heard of him before, but...  Go check him out.  I encourage all our listeners to go over there.  Yeah, well, anyway...  Check out the comedic stylings of Will Pentarvis. 
[01:31:30]  I don't care what...  That's how scared we are.  We'll even give him a commercial.  Go, go, go right now.  Check him out.  Yeah, a lot of...  I don't care how he compares you guys to John Rocker.  Like, what does that mean?  Because you guys aren't afraid to open your mouth?  Like, is this guy against the First Amendment?  I mean, because you guys aren't afraid to say nigger?  You have to say the N-word?  I mean, what does this country want it to?  Well, we are, Vinny.  Say the N-word.  What's happening with this country?  Oh, my God. 
[01:32:00]  We just try to speak our mind.  Well, here's another one.  Like, you know, you watch the news and you hear these people are so afraid to say the wrong  thing.  They have to say African-American.  Vinny is angry, man.  When they talk about white people, we're just white.  I mean, start calling me Italian-American.  Let's put that in front of every...  No, can we not do that, Vinny, please?  For the sake of all the Italians out there.  No, come on, Anthony.  Stop.  Come on.  You know what I'm saying is the truth.  And I just wanted to ask you guys.  I just wanted to ask you guys, if it's possible, if I could go head-to-head with O.D. 
[01:32:30]  I mean, face-to-face, maybe on your show, with a little...  I don't know.  Just talking about, like, the things that are going on.  Because, obviously, he sees things from a weird point of view.  I mean, this guy thinks O.J. was innocent.  I mean, I don't know what's wrong with this guy.  Yeah, well, you guys will go at it again.  You think it's ever possible we can meet face-to-face?  Ah, yeah.  What the hell?  Serious?  Yeah.  Wait, there's a guy that wants to rip you today.  Aw, come on.  I think we did this yesterday, but we'll give Chris a shot.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on? 
[01:33:00]  I just called two seconds ago.  I'm back on because that little punk-ass bitch, little racist Vinny, I'll rip you a new one.  Hey, Sag.  I'm like 240 pounds.  I'll bust your house.  I'm mad on 260, bitch.  I will whoop your ass.  I will whoop your ass.  How dare you talk about Puerto Ricans, baby.  Me and Rip will come back with a freaking, uh, kick your ass, you freaking...  You got nothing against Rick.  He works.  You probably don't, you bum.  You probably drive around with your little Puerto Rican flag hanging off your mirror. 
[01:33:30]  I don't have a Puerto Rican flag.  You don't have a car.  You don't have a car.  You probably have a bicycle.  Why are you putting an American flag in your car?  You freaking little...  There you is.  Yeah, little.  You freaking greaseball.  You freaking Italian greaseball bastard.  No, why do you guys first name it, Paul?  You're a little greaseball.  You're a greaseball.  All right.  Here's the real racist.  Go and have some macaroni, all right?  Go and cook yourself some macaroni.  Go and cook yourself some macaroni.  Go and cook yourself some macaroni.  You got him with that one.  Yeah.  You're the real racist, kid.  You got to start calling me a greaseball. 
[01:34:00]  Why?  I, what, am I calling you names?  I'm just saying how these are.  You said it yesterday, you freaking greaseball.  What am I saying?  I said to your people, goomba.  Goomba.  I'm not saying any lies.  Damn, goomba.  What are you talking about?  We are so doomed as a society because, like, we'll never get along.  It'll never be like Vulcan, you know, where everyone is just logical and gets along.  There will be hatred on this planet forever until we just blow ourselves up or a meteor hit  so we spin into the sun. 
[01:34:30]  And there will always be hatred on this planet.  That's what amazes me when they get these groups together that try to, like, wipe out  the hate.  Stop the, silence the violence.  Do the, it ain't going to work.  We're animals.  It's all because of the little, um, uh, greasy little dagos.  We're animals.  That's all it is.  That's all it boils down to.  It's sure we know how to pull things out of the ground and make buildings out of them  and planes and cars.  But the bottom line, we're still animals.  We look at something and hate it.  And we want to kill it. 
[01:35:00]  Hey, Vinny.  That's just the way we are.  Uh, Gary Conrad, the hypnotist, is here.  Could you come in so we can hypnotize you to love black people?  I don't think that would ever happen.  We will never love black people because he's a little racist, goomba-gainy, freaking, uh,  eggplant parmesan-y.  I got nothing against black people.  I said that.  I don't hate black people.  I think there's great black people.  I'll tell you what.  I wish that guy, J.C.  Watts, would win the presidency or that Alan Keyes.  They'd be two great presidents.  They're called black.  I don't hate black people. 
[01:35:30]  I'm just saying there's something wrong with, uh, these people where, I don't know if it's  a family breakdown where they're filling up the prisons.  They're committing a ton of crime and nobody's talking about it.  They're telling the Italians, bro.  What are you talking about?  They're telling the Italians.  What are we talking?  Look at freaking Gotti.  Look at Gotti.  Everyone always points back to Gotti, don't they?  Leave Gotti alone.  Well, I think Gotti's a pretty cool guy, buddy.  You better say that.  You might be tapping your phone right now.  Be careful.  You better say that.  All right, listen, you guys.  We've got to fly. 
[01:36:00]  All right, man.  Vinny, it's always a pleasure.  Okay, son.  Vinny's going to be our new morning man, hopefully soon.  Because I would listen to this every single day of my life.  Vinny in the morning.  I think I'm going to head with OG.  All right, Vinny.  Hold on.  Rick wants to talk to you.  All right.  Hold on.  You call back any time.  Thanks, fellas.  He gets the phones going, Anthony.  Vinny in the morning.  Well, we pretty much, uh, we pretty much did that bit yesterday.  Yeah.  You want our new, uh, lineup promo, Anthony? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, let's hear it.  You know what's funny?  Why?  We told everyone that we have a new morning show and it's going to be anal radio all morning long.  Yeah.  A bunch of people on the email before the show today.  Hey, man, I was excited to tune in the brand new morning show and check out anal radio.  And instead, I hear two schmucks this morning.  Oh, come on.  All right.  We'll be back.  Gary Conrad's here.  So we're going to get some people hypnotized.  A couple people on the line here that want to talk about seeing their parents have sex.  You guys stay right there, Mike and Chuck.  I don't know if anyone will be Keith's story. 
[01:37:00]  That was pretty funny.  We got to replay that.  Funny, Keith.  We got to get that right back on the air.  Yeah, that was very funny.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  I'll be in Anthony afternoon.  Anal radio morning.  The wind will sit with you.  On 1027 WNEW.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, yeah.  You packed on some pounds for the holidays, didn't you?  Everybody, winter weather, I'll say you can bundle up.  You're not as conscious about your gut.  This winter sucks, man. 
[01:37:30]  It got cold all of a sudden and now we'll go away.  This is like the first winter in, what, three years?  It just blows.  Very cold January and now it's still cold.  But you're bundled up, you know.  You're not noticing that you're packed on a few pounds.  Yeah, the groundhog saw its shadow today.  Did it?  It saw its shadow.  It did?  Six more weeks of winter, Anthony.  I didn't even know it was Groundhog Day.  Although, I watched Groundhog Day on the TV because they play that 24 hours a day every day on TBS for some reason.  I love that movie. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, very fun.  Why don't we have Spaz in a groundhog outfit popping out of a pothole?  I'm sure there was one station in this town that did that stupid bit.  The groundhog.  We're going to have one of our own staff dressed as a groundhog popping out of a pothole.  Oh, I'm sure someone did something on that today.  Well, we're going to have a cab driver come out of a manhole cover, see if he sees a shadow. 
[01:38:30]  That's how we decide if there's going to be a longer winter.  Because we're wacky.  That's funny.  All right, Ann, stack it to the World Series.  Pat Byrne, a lot of people also gain weight from the Super Bowl, you know.  Yeah.  They're picking out like crazy.  Big heroes and stuff.  You've got to burn the weight off.  What are you going to do?  I ask you.  You're going to pop some stack or two.  Stack or two, World's Strongest Fat Burner, burns the fat.  Also, what else does it do?  It gives you a boost of energy if you're feeling sluggish during the day. 
[01:39:00]  And then it, oh, cuts the cravings to a snack.  Boy, I almost forgot that.  Very good.  Yeah.  Well, you don't need to know this stuff.  You're a slim guy.  Yes.  You're trying to help out our fat friends out there.  I can't afford to get fat either, Opie.  Why?  Because I don't have many clothes.  I'd have to go out and buy new clothes, which I can't do.  Okay.  Stack or two, the World's Strongest Fat Burner.  They have a website, www.stacker2.com.  Stack or two.com.  Or give them a call, 1-800-LITELINE. 
[01:39:30]  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stack or two, the World's Strongest Fat Burner.  And thousands have proven it works.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Gary Conrad waiting to come on in.  We got Cowbell Bill in the studio helping us out, giving us a lot of energy today.  We appreciate that, Bill.  Ant and I are sick of looking at each other.  Thank you for breaking it up. 
[01:40:00]  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  All right.  There's a bunch of people on the line, Anthony, that caught their parents having sex.  Yeah.  Kind of disgusting.  We can kind of go with this for a little while and see what happens.  Melissa, you're next on NEW.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  Well, I have a really, really terrible story to tell you.  What happened was I was in a car accident.  It was like around 2 in the morning.  You know, I went to the ER, got stitches on my forehead and so on. 
[01:40:30]  So I'm getting home and, you know, I'm really scared.  So I want to talk to my parents.  So I go up, you know, up the stairs to their bedroom.  And I walked in on them and my mom was giving my dad a Hummer.  And when she saw the stitches in the blood, she just stopped and said,  Oh, my God, what happened?  And my dad, you know, it's like they acted like I didn't walk in and didn't see anything.  So it was kind of embarrassing.  I don't know if I was more shocked because of my accident or because I actually saw them, you know, doing what they were doing.  So your dad was just going to hang in there.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Your dad's junk was right there for you to see and everything.  Well, not really.  You were a purple baby boy.  But, you know, I mean, she had it in her mouth.  Oh.  And then she just stopped and said, Oh, my God, what happened?  And she was trying to, you know, caress my face.  And I was like, Oh, my, please.  Yeah.  Oh, touching your face.  And God only knows what her hands were on.  Yeah.  She didn't try to.  I know what they were on.  I saw it.  She didn't try to kiss you, did she?  She did?  She didn't try to kiss you to make your boo-boo better, did she?  Well, she just, you know, she just grabbed my face and was trying to look at my forehead and the cut. 
[01:41:30]  And she just kind of hugged me.  And my dad just turned around and I guess he put it away or whatever.  I don't know.  It was really embarrassing.  Melissa, your mom went from one head to another.  Yeah, I guess you could say that.  All right.  Wow.  Timing's everything.  That would have worked much better than 10 seconds ago.  Thank you.  Well, that's a good story, Melissa.  All right.  Are you embarrassed?  You guys suck.  Hey, are you embarrassed for your father?  Excuse me?  Are you embarrassed for your father, if you know what I mean? 
[01:42:00]  No.  Like, you know, was it like anything you have ever seen in your day?  Well, I didn't want to look till my dad was just, you know, shocked that my mom was coming at me.  Come on.  Nothing happened.  You looked.  You looked.  Your dad wasn't coming at you.  You looked.  How did your dad, you know, measure up?  Oh, God.  That's my dad.  I know.  But you definitely looked.  You looked.  Now you know.  All right.  And, you know, what was the first one?  I guess I could tell my mom's a lucky woman.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:42:30]  Okay.  God damn.  This is wrong.  Yeah.  You wanted daddy's, didn't you?  No.  You're a filthy whore, Melissa.  I like that.  All right, Melissa.  All right.  Nice talking to you guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks for sharing today.  Where the hell is this show going today?  David, you're next on N.E.W.  Mom's happy.  I don't like it here.  All right.  What?  Tom Liker's here.  All right, Tom.  I'm just kidding.  No, check it out.  I had, it wasn't that embarrassing, but when you invite a friend over for WrestleMania, 
[01:43:00]  can I say that on the radio?  Yeah, sure.  Well, I'm watching WrestleMania, and sure enough, I just went upstairs to ask my mom a question,  and I walk in, and my dad's got, you know, my mom, like, all the way.  Can you say the poop shoot?  Easy on that.  Yeah.  Look, so you walked in.  He was violating your mom, and he was, yeah, he was exploring the balloon knot.  Oh, that's right.  I thought it was, I thought it was something about the balloon knot. 
[01:43:30]  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  And you walked in on that?  Yeah.  They came out, like, 20 minutes later, and they're like, son, let's have a talk.  I'm like, let's not have a talk.  Have a talk.  Dad, go wash off your area first, man.  You know?  But it was good for Dad.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  It's really good to explore, you know?  You're pretty psyched your dad's getting, uh...  Come on.  All right.  Balloon knot city, baby.  Okay.  Here's what it sounds like now when your mom farts. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, thanks, boo.  Thanks, David.  All right.  Bye.  So juvenile, Opie.  Chuck.  You.  How are you?  What's up, Owen?  Hey.  Cowboy, Bill.  Hey.  Hey, uh, my story's like this.  Cowboy.  It's sort of not embarrassing for me.  When I was younger, say, like 11, 12 years old, we were me and two of my buddies, like  just three amigos in the neighborhood or whatever.  So, uh, what we used to do was, we would, uh, check there. 
[01:44:30]  I'm just laughing any time anyone calls him Cowboy Bill, because he's a drummer, he's  a drummer, and it's Cowbell Bill.  And, like, whenever anyone says Cowboy Bill, me and him start laughing, because we're just  picturing him wearing, like, a big 10-gallon hat and boots.  Wow, dude, you're glad.  That's from the Pee-Wee Herman Show.  That black guy from the Pee-Wee Herman Show.  Cowboy Kenneth.  Anyway, so the deal is, what we used to do is, my one friend's mom had a, you know, 
[01:45:00]  they were divorced, and her boyfriend and her used to disappear into the bedroom.  So we used to go out to the garage and get a really tiny little drill bit.  And my friend, whose mother it was, would actually get the drill bit, and it was, like, you know,  those, you know those doorknobs you have in your half, just a little round hole on the  outside.  We'd stick the bit in there and pick the door lock.  And we would just, we'd open the door, put it open gently, and be, like, three heads  stacked on top of each other, just blaring in there.  You know, we're 11, 12 years old, so we haven't had any sexual experiences at all.  We don't know what's going on. 
[01:45:30]  We're watching this.  And the kicker was, the guy who's drunk was, you know, on the person's side.  We didn't even know what the hell that was.  You know, next day we're looking in there, we're expecting to see what we got.  We see this thing, a little, like an anteater.  We don't know what the hell was going on.  We're looking at the horn with the guy, you know.  That was the only embarrassing part, but this went on for, I'd say, a good two years,  two, three times a week.  We'd stash lenses up behind our bedroom window, and we'd, like, piggyback each other up 
[01:46:00]  to try and catch a boost, try and keep you, keep you, keep you, keep you, keep you, keep you back.  And it all ended, and it all ended at one time.  At one time, we thought we got busted.  The boyfriend saw us.  He was the embarrassed one.  Next thing you know, we get into the room, we start playing Nintendo.  Mr. Nigger Charlie.  We're playing, you know, Nintendo, Super Mario Brothers or something like that.  He comes in, potato chips.  So this guy, they call us, you know, stay off and dumbass and stuff every time we feed us. 
[01:46:30]  Now, he's going to the room bringing us sodas and potato chips.  Do you guys hear anything?  You're about to be just embarrassed, you know.  He jumps having the anteater head on it.  Chuck, we can't take any more.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, boy.  That's a very good story.  Rot hell.  Okay.  We're rotten hell.  Come on.  I don't think I heard a word he said.  I'm laughing too friggin' hot.  All right, Cowboy Bill.  You know, that's your new name now.  No, it ain't.  No, it ain't. 
[01:47:00]  Friendly Ann calls me Cowboy Bill.  Rob, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, so when I was about 12, I was going through my parents, you know.  This is a cabin.  This is a drill.  Just, you know, peeking through for a look.  And so I find this little VHS tape, you know.  So I pop it in the VCR.  You know what it is.  It's my parents going at it.  Oh, my God.  On video?  Yeah, right?  Oh, you know, they're yelling at each other.  Oh, baby.  Oh, you know, I don't want to get into it.  How much did you watch?  So an hour later.  Yeah, really. 
[01:47:30]  You know, like 10 seconds later, my dog got on the bed, man.  Oh, I'm not licking my mother all over the place.  Oh, stop.  You know what happens.  You know, you're playing with your dog.  You're licking your face.  Then you see that?  Oh, come on.  I swear to God.  I'm not even believing that.  Why would you make that up?  Because you're sick.  To be on the radio.  Come on.  Was the dog sporting the little red pepper?  Come on.  That's a great line from Cowbell Bell. 
[01:48:00]  Here he goes, a-riding in his house.  A-whooping and a-womp and everything but in the edge of his life.  It's Cowboy Biz.  I'm-a gonna clean up this city. 
[01:48:30]  Even it's the last thing I do.  Keith's mom is on the line?  Oh, no.  Come on.  No way.  Uh-oh.  Keith's mom.  Hey, yes.  I'm Keith's mom.  All right.  Now, Keith was-  You sound a lot like Keith.  Keith was on the air about 15 minutes ago.  He caught you and Daddy having sex. 
[01:49:00]  Keith says, I mean, I was unaware of that, but it reminded me of, first of all, they deserve  whatever they get because they never leave us alone.  And we try to barricade our room.  And if that doesn't work, they hear the bed squeaking, they take a broom handle and bang  on the living room ceiling.  It's the coolest thing, yes.  And, uh, but, um, what I wanted to say was that it reminded me when I heard him on the  radio.  Your voice sounds a little hoarse. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  I sound hoarse?  I smoke.  Go like this.  Ahem.  I'm nervous.  That's okay.  Anyway, my nephew one time-  The white owl.  The white owl.  No, I don't smoke cigars.  Oh, yeah, sure.  The cigar on the brand is called Keith's Dad.  What?  Nothing.  Go ahead, Keith's mom.  Anyway, one time my nephew was, uh, we had, like, company and my husband, he wanted, uh,  having matinee.  So we, what we do is we shut the bedroom door and then we open the closet door so it 
[01:50:00]  goes against the bedroom door.  Barricade it in a little bit, yeah.  Double door.  And, uh, we're having, like, a final time up there and all of a sudden the kids, I didn't  know it, they were playing hide and seek.  So was your, uh, your husband.  Hide the salami.  No, we were, yeah, but not that way.  Seat the meat.  Oh, my God, listen to her voice.  And we're both pretty big people, you know? 
[01:50:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, so poor Keith saw two fat people having sex.  Oh, yeah.  You know, like, is it in?  Listen to her.  Now we know where your son gets his chops from.  I know.  There's one good thing he took care of.  It's a comedic family here.  Okay, go ahead.  So, um, we're up there and, uh, all of a sudden the door, my nephew hit the bedroom door so  hard that the closet door swung shut, the bedroom door opened, and there he was. 
[01:51:00]  Well, my husband, I never saw my husband jump off.  He did like a pirouette in the sky and landed on the floor.  So, my nephew, he just went like, oh, sorry.  It's going to make you puke.  No, no.  So, he runs out of the room.  So, now my husband wants to, like, saw it, and, you know, just where he left off, I was  like, no, Dad, I can't.  I can't now.  You know, I forget it.  Wait till later.  Oh, man, you left him hanging? 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  What a messed up family.  You're having sex.  Your kids get to watch you.  Nephews, nieces, whoever the hell wants to open the door.  Hide and seek going on.  You got company downstairs.  You need to screw upstairs.  It was the worst position ever you could find someone.  Uh-oh.  What were you doing?  God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  I don't even know what that meant on the radio.  If that didn't make it on the air, let's just say, um.  Okay.  Yeah, you could say numbers.  69.  Yeah, okay. 
[01:52:00]  Hold the cheese.  So I said, I felt like I had to say something to my nephews.  You know, because I was like.  All of a sudden, the kid had to hanker in for some Arby's roast beef sandwich.  Yeah, well, no.  I don't want him to feel uncomfortable.  I just sit downstairs, and I point to my finger in his face, and I just, I think, I hope you  have nightmares for the rest of your life.  I will from coming off of that finger.  How much?  How much does mom and dad weigh? 
[01:52:30]  I just need to really picture this.  Well, we're very tall.  How much do you weigh?  Must be it.  Well, I'm about two.  All right.  Two bills, huh?  He's about 260.  And you guys are in the 69th position.  Your kids check that out.  No, I left you.  Well, at least I was facing the other way.  Oh, so the kid got the bob shot?  No.  No. 
[01:53:00]  You're traumatizing children.  It's like a hot air balloon shot.  Hey, but this dang nephew, this is a few years ago, but this dang nephew, he just got caught  caught by his girlfriend's father.  The upside down hot air balloon shot.  Oh, my son's yelling at me now.  Anyway, I really like your show over there.  Yeah, everyone likes yours.  I'm a friend who listens every afternoon.  That is so funny.  Is your son there with you right now? 
[01:53:30]  No, he's just in the other room because he's by the radio.  I'm in the den.  Oh, yeah.  I've been sleeping on the couch.  All right, we've got to talk to Keith again.  Get him on the phone.  Okay, hang on.  Oh, my God.  Social services, please get over there and take those children.  For God's sake.  We've just got to keep them on the line for two more minutes.  We'll have the address.  Hello?  Hey, what's up?  Keith, did you hear what you were saying on the radio?  Yeah.  That's pretty embarrassing, huh?  Yeah, I guess so. 
[01:54:00]  So your mom's like a big gal?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  It's a bit.  And your dad's pretty big?  I look like two pigs fighting over a milk gun.  Keith, you rule, man.  That is funny.  Keith, we've got to go drink beers with you, man.  Oh, man.  Do you know what your mom's favorite number is? 
[01:54:30]  Don't, don't.  Oh, Keith, you getting in trouble?  Oh, now the motherly of a...  69.  Are you getting in trouble, Keith?  Huh?  You getting in trouble?  No, my mom just said, don't tell us.  Don't tell you where we live.  Oh, no.  Hey, so, Keith.  Yeah?  Your cousin saw your mom and dad having sex?  Oh, yeah.  What did he say about it?  Yeah, what did he say afterwards?  I don't know.  I was really young, but he had a horrific look on his face. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, man.  That's pretty awful.  Yeah.  You know, you don't want to see that.  But guess what?  What?  Same kid dropped out of high school.  Well, that probably affected him.  He was traumatized.  Yeah.  How old is your mom?  She's around 46.  Yeah, and they're still going at it, huh?  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  It seems like you guys catch them having sex a lot, according to her.  Yeah.  They try locking the door with the closet. 
[01:55:30]  It doesn't work, huh?  Put a chair up against the doorknob.  Yeah.  They make these things called locks, Keith.  Yeah, really.  What about a lock?  My brother has one.  You ever walk in on him?  No.  No?  All right, Keith.  All right, man.  Well, you keep in touch.  I will.  I'd like to know what's happening in the wacky world to your parents.  We're going to need updates, Keith.  They aren't smoking that wacky tobacco, are they? 
[01:56:00]  I have no idea.  Yeah, you better say that.  Yeah.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah?  Do you have pubes yet?  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  You always got to go there, man.  It's the bang on the head this morning.  I'm not thinking right.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  All right, Keith.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling back.  We're having your mom call us, all right?  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  The Keith family.  The Keith family.  All right.  Stuff going on over there. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  All right.  We got to move on.  Gary Conrad, the hypnotist, is here.  Uh-huh.  Well, we'll get into it next.  If you weren't listening earlier, there's lots to discuss with that.  Okay?  Yeah.  Stay there.  A radio chick special announcement, Anthony.  What?  That's what that promo just said.  I heard she was thinking about wowing us once again today.  Really?  She's all talk.  We love her and all, but she's all talk.  Yeah, I don't think she's going to be wowing anybody. 
[01:57:00]  Don't tease us.  Come in and just do it.  Yeah.  It is whipping out Wednesday, by the way.  Yes, it is.  Something we'll be bringing back in the spring.  It'll be bigger than ever this year.  Believe me.  But it's still happening if you want to put wow in your car and have the girls flash on  the way home.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, you know, if the nice weather's around, you've got your wow on and you get wowed.  There you go.  You got an instant feedback there, eh?  Yeah, I'm looking for it, Opie.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  You know how it is in this computer age.  That's okay.  Let me go to Mark first then.  Mark, what's going on?  Mark?  Yeah.  You're on the air, bro.  What's up?  What's up?  Dude, you should make that kid the new morning show.  Keith should be our new morning show?  Yeah.  I think the whole Keith family.  Yeah.  You've got to get the dad story.  Oh, he was sleeping on the couch.  Maybe we should wake him up.  Yeah.  By the way, Keith's got a call back.  We want to get his phone number so we can get updates from him.  All right.  Definitely, dude.  Thank you, Mark. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  You've got to talk later.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah.  Tommy, in Jersey.  My wife and I were banging away when all of a sudden I looked up and my wife's 84-year-old  Alzheimer's demented grandmother walked into the bedroom and started yelling at me to  get off her granddaughter.  Yuck.  It took me a month to get it up again.  She had the grandma whiskers and stuff.  Get off my granddaughter.  What are you doing on my granddaughter?  Oh, that would scare the crap out of you.  Gray hair flying all over the place. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  Let's get Gary Conrad in here, finally.  All right.  Anthony has become a skeptic.  He doesn't believe in hypnosis.  Yes, I am a true skeptic.  Gary was in here a couple months ago, and he blew everyone away.  Mr. Conrad, back in the studio for a return engagement.  Yeah.  Hello?  Sir?  Yes.  I got to tell you.  Yes.  I know you've been listening.  Yes. 
[01:59:00]  And hearing what's going on, I am truly a skeptic.  Complete skeptic.  Mr. Conrad, I want to go on record and say I truly believe in the hypnosis.  And I got to say, also, I don't know what their motives would be.  Like, I can't give you any explanation as to why I'm so skeptical.  I don't know what their motivation is.  Ratings, probably.  To do what he did last time, Rick and Spaz, when they were under hypnosis.  But I just, I cannot believe that you are so powerful that you can get a human being, Rick, to act like an infant in the corner. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, well, you know, in 1491, I thought the world was flat, too.  So sometimes you have to believe in the determining factor.  I'm thinking archaically, fine.  We're putting a challenge out to you today, Gary.  Oh, really?  I got a challenge.  I mean, I'm going to try to make Anthony believe.  I completely believe.  Steve completely believes.  You got to let me plug my show first.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead. 
[02:00:00]  I'm going to be at Rascals Comedy Club, West Orange, New Jersey, all week.  And tomorrow night and the second show, Friday night, we're going to do an erotic show.  Uh-oh.  Nice.  Under hypnosis.  And tonight, you're going to be on a worldwide web.  Rascals is starting this thing up where you can, my wife's in Australia, she'll be watching it tonight.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  So you got to hit, like, www.com or something like that.  Oh, you're not a web guy.  You're not a web guy.  You can tell her.  You don't want people just going to www.com.  What is www.com?  I'm going to be for Rascals Comedy Club. 
[02:00:30]  I'm going to be www.com.  Let me see real quick.  Let's see what comes up.  All right.  But you're there all week starting tonight?  Yeah, they're all week.  And tonight, they're going to have it on the worldwide web.  Okay.  www.com.  Rascals Comedy Club, something like that.  Oh, it does say on air.  Bingo.  Hey, look at that.  Now that.  See, Rick doubted that.  Anthony doubted that, too.  Wait a minute.  I don't know what this is.  We don't know what this is.  Some kind of Millennium Bash website thing, it looks like. 
[02:01:00]  It's amazing.  You don't know the real website there, Gary?  I don't know.  Maybe rascals.com.  Yeah, they'll know it.  All right.  973-736-Rascals.com.  2726.  Rascals.com.  Sorry about that, guys.  That's okay.  Also in the studio today, Cowbell Bill, Gary.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're back.  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  Now, so I guess, yeah, and ask him some questions.  Yeah.  When I left here last time, you were such a believer, and you admitted. 
[02:01:30]  You had an epistle.  Right.  You admitted right on the air.  Okay.  And I go, I told you.  I told you.  And you're reading a lot of Humble Crow.  Uh-huh.  I agree.  Without a doubt, because I was listening to it on the way out of here, without a doubt,  this truly happened.  Rick would not be in the corner sitting on the ground looking at a quarter, a shiny quarter  like that for 20 minutes.  And then he.  I agree with you.  I did say that.  But now you're in thinking.  Yeah.  Then he started thinking about it.  When I really started mulling it over, and I was looking at the videotape and kind of 
[02:02:00]  really talking to Rick and Spaz about it.  And I got to say, they didn't say anything that would lead anyone to believe that they  weren't, in fact, hypnotized.  But I, I don't know.  What about the verbiage that your program director utilized on air, which you're not supposed  to say even at your show?  And I hope he was saying like that.  He knows we have a half hour of dump time stored up, and any curse words would be thrown  out. 
[02:02:30]  Well, what do we need to do, though?  Watch.  See?  There you go.  See?  There we go.  I know he hits the button and it goes away.  Hi, Mom.  Hi, Dad.  I know you're listening.  I hit the hype.  Well, Ann, ask him some of the questions you were talking about before, like, you know,  robbing banks.  Right.  Now, if you could get people to act like an infant in the corner, couldn't you indeed  hypnotize a bank teller?  Afghanistan, Bananistan.  Open up the bank vault or something.  Well, maybe. 
[02:03:00]  If they robbed the bank before, you probably could get them to do it again.  All right.  And, I mean, wouldn't there be other things, ways you could use this talent to, I don't  know, get yourself rich or, well, you're probably doing that by entertaining.  I understand.  The man asks the question, then he answers his own question.  But, I mean, other things, maybe.  Why don't they hypnotize, you know, you'll hypnotize a world leader.  All of a sudden, we have world peace.  Well, maybe they have. 
[02:03:30]  I never went the other way, though.  Maybe it wasn't a good hypnotist.  I don't know.  See, I'm just very skeptical.  That's all.  And I want to know, is there, like, everyone's saying it would be impossible now because I'm  so skeptical to hypnotize me.  Well, if you followed the directions, you would definitely be hypnotized.  I would definitely be hypnotized.  You would definitely be hypnotized big time because in the back of your mind, you can't  get past the fact that Rick was on the ground looking at that corner.  Lurking in the back of your mind is that image. 
[02:04:00]  Right.  And if you follow them instructions, you're going to go big time.  Now, if you halt in the middle of this thing, you know, to take measurements that, well,  am I hypnotizing?  Am I not hypnotizing?  Am I more relaxed more now than I was 10 minutes ago?  Will I be more relaxed 10 minutes from now?  Then it's not going to work because we're pulling out.  We're moving already fast.  And you're going to say, wait, wait, wait, we're going to stop everybody to take these  measurements.  Uh-uh.  We're going, pal.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  So now what do you have, Lavoris, today?  Did you?  What do you think? 
[02:04:30]  Like, what do you?  I think anybody can be hypnotized.  It's like anybody can bake a cake.  I don't want to.  You keep it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Guess what?  You got a cake going there, pal.  Right.  You open that door every five minutes.  Is that yeast rising?  Is that thing going up there?  I see.  No, it's going to fall flat.  It's not going to work.  You can't be assessing it as you go along.  You just have to let it go.  Your tuition dollar's at work, right?  So what are we going to do here? 
[02:05:00]  We got a few people.  We got two people who want to be hypnotized.  I mean, I'd definitely be willing to go in and really give it a shot.  I mean, if it happens.  I'm glad you didn't say try, but yeah.  Well, we'll work with you, yeah.  Okay.  If it happens, it happens.  If it doesn't, it doesn't.  But if you don't follow instructions, we got to help.  Are you going to try to get hypnotized?  Don't try.  You're not trying.  I mean, just go with it.  Oh, here it comes.  I'm being hypnotized.  No, I will.  I will pop out at that point.  My prediction is he'll pop out. 
[02:05:30]  When he feels it coming on, he's going to slam on a break.  And I want out.  I'm not, you know, ready to have an orgasm.  I said on the radio.  Oh, what do you think we're doing this shit?  I said on the radio earlier, I don't think he's going to go under.  Well, we'll see.  I don't know.  I'm just myself a skeptic.  I can't.  What am I supposed to do?  You know, there are plenty of people.  We got emails up to Yimby and me.  Phone calls saying, hey, I've seen it.  Totally believe it.  People that have been hypnotized by you and a lot of your appearances say, it is absolutely a fact. 
[02:06:00]  I have nothing to back up my skepticism on, but I am indeed skeptical.  That's all I can say.  Don't know why.  All right.  So what are we going to do here?  We got the gauntlet.  Here we go.  We got Spaz again.  Whoa.  He's an all-time great.  Yeah, he's a favorite.  I really like him.  We got a couple guys out there.  Who else we got, Rick?  We got a few guys that you invited yesterday to come down.  Camera guy wants to do it.  Unofficial Steve might give it a try. 
[02:06:30]  I might try my identity.  Don't say try.  All right.  No, you just got to go with it.  Okay.  All right.  Fine.  You're going to have a lot of people then today, Gary.  You got Anthony's going to try it, Spaz.  Nobody tries.  We give it a shot.  We give it a shot.  Psycho Mark is giving me a problem.  Psycho Marks can't do it?  I'm too busy with work.  He's scared because he knows he'll do some crazy things under hypnosis.  He's got to go to work for the American people at work.  He never does.  He's always hanging out.  You know, he's afraid he might act like a normal human being under hypnosis. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  And how many of those guys out there?  We got three extra guys out there.  Three extra guys?  Okay.  We'll just take the best ones.  Yeah, well, that's what happened last time.  All right.  How much time are you going to need, Gary?  I don't know.  It depends on how intelligent they are.  Oh.  It's going to take a while.  The smarter ones go under quicker.  The sharper ones, the more creative ones, are quick.  And that's just the way.  Oh, look at that.  See that?  Look at that.  I'm going to have some trouble here on my lap.  I like this challenge.  That's almost a disclaimer. 
[02:07:30]  What?  It's almost like, no, it's a knock to me.  And if I don't go under, then I'm not intelligent or sharp.  Well, he's feeling the challenge.  He's going to, you know.  All right.  I understand.  He's very protective of his talents.  I got a question for you.  Once you're under, can you snap?  Can you do any stuff you want to have?  Yes, you can pop out any time.  Sure.  Okay.  Because we had this question earlier.  When Rick was playing with that quarter as a five-year-old in the corner,  if all of a sudden I said, Rick, fire in the building. 
[02:08:00]  We've got to get out of here.  Would he snap out?  No, you were Uncle Opie at the time.  I know.  I know.  Uncle Opie, please get me out of the building quick.  I'm not even saying, like, there's a fire.  What if there was a fire in the building,  and all of a sudden he's left alone as an infant in the corner?  Would he crawl under a cabinet and die of smoke inhalation like an infant would?  No, I think his survival mechanism would kick in, and that happens at any age,  and he'd just cow.  Survival is his number one instinct.  Okay.  He'd probably get you out of here.  Probably would.  All right.  Well, let's be crawling over every once in a while. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  And I'd have my quarter.  Women, children.  Yeah, with the quarter.  Well, let's get this rolling, then, eh?  Okay.  All right.  We got Gary Conrad, the hypnotist, in the studio.  He was great last time.  He's going to be at Rascals for the rest of the week.  Call Rascals for show info, okay?  I'm ready.  All right, eh, go for it.  We'll see you in a few minutes, hopefully.  We'll take a break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  All right, it's the Opie and Cowbell Bills show, everyone.  Hey.  Anthony's in the other room with Gary Conrad, the hypnotist.  He's going to get put under, hopefully. 
[02:09:00]  And we'll see if Anthony is still a skeptic after the session.  I just don't think he's going to go under, man.  No way.  I don't know.  You know, I don't know how powerful this stuff is, but one thing I can tell you is I'll know.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, you've known Anthony all your life, Bill?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll be able to tell.  Very good.  Gary Conrad, he'll be appearing at Rascals all this weekend.  We got the real website.  What was it?  www.com.  No, it's not.  Rascalscomedy.com, I believe. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  There it is.  Rascalscomedyclub.com.  But Gary Conrad, they're all weekend long.  A couple of erotic shows thrown in there if you want to call Rascals for all the info.  Okay?  We're going to play a couple tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the studio.  Spaz is in there.  We got Anthony.  There's no way it's going under.  And we got Steve from the unofficial website and a couple of our listeners stop by as well.  What, Rick?  I don't know.  I think Anthony might actually end up going under.  Because he said guys who are sharp and creative tend to get under pretty quick. 
[02:10:00]  If Hank goes under, it could be some great radio.  If he goes under.  With the mind he has.  All right.  Let's play a couple tunes and then we'll see what kind of progress they're making in the other studio.  Okay?  It's 1027-WNEW.  Motley Crue.  Dr. Feelgood.  Crank it up.  We'll be back in a couple tunes.  We'll be in Anthony.  I like that.  This is debauchery mania.  I like that. 
[02:10:30]  Prostate exams for everyone.  I like that.  111-027-WNEW.  Yes, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  212-757-1027.  It's only Opie in the studio with Cowbell Bill, Anthony's childhood friend who stops in from time to time  and helps out with the radio show with his stories and his observations.  And our buddy Anthony's in the other studio.  He's hopefully getting hypnotized by Gary Conrad, the hypnotist, that does a great job for our radio show. 
[02:11:00]  I completely believe in this hypnosis.  Anthony, a big-time skeptic.  He's in there with Spaz and Steve from the unofficial website and like three or four of our listeners.  And we should have him in the studio in 10 or 15 minutes.  What do you guys think?  You think he's going under, Bill?  I don't know, but...  I'm looking at the back of his head right now.  I'm trying to like pick up on some signs that it might be working.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to see from here.  Because he's in the middle of hypnotizing these guys as we speak. 
[02:11:30]  He looks like a little kid looking at the school teacher.  He does, right?  So, hopefully...  I'm keeping my fingers crossed here.  I don't know.  Yeah, we've got to try and come up with something that we know he would never do.  Well, I think the listeners know Anthony pretty well at this point.  We need suggestions for Anthony.  If he does come in here, hypnotize things that Anthony can do.  Stupid things, obviously.  Things he would never do if he wasn't under hypnosis. 
[02:12:00]  Right, like I see here, you know, have him act like Spaz and have Spaz act like him.  Well, he does that all the time.  212-757-1027.  We got a surprise for Spaz, though, today.  Ben, where's the doll?  Don't pull it out, because Spaz might be able to see it from the other room.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, Spaz, he's great at this.  Gary Conrad loves Spaz under hypnosis.  He's going to have Spaz have sex with a blow-up doll.  Oh.  What?  He said fall in love with.  Oh, fall in love with? 
[02:12:30]  I don't know if we want to see him have sex with a doll.  It would be pretty funny.  Why not?  But I got the video camera ready.  Steve gave it to me, so.  Okay.  Ben, you're next on the radio show.  What's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, O?  All right.  Oh, it's usually.  How you doing, O&A?  I know.  That's why I said O.  Anyway, I predict that Anthony's way too afraid to give anybody control of himself to be hypnotized.  There's no way he's coming back.  I think you just hit it on the head.  I've known him for five and a half years. 
[02:13:00]  Bill has known him a lot longer than that.  And I just don't think he's going to go with it.  It's a control thing, you know?  You know, he doesn't want to get his mind.  He's got to let himself completely over to, you know, the hypnosis.  Right.  And that ain't going to happen.  Anyway, that's my prediction.  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Hey, Rick, run out of the studio.  Gary popped out of the studio.  See how much time he needs.  Make that call.  This is funny.  This could be real funny.  Mark, what's going on? 
[02:13:30]  How you doing?  Good.  Make Anthony call his wife back until he wants to get back together.  What do you think?  Do you think he's going to do it?  Well, that would prove he's something.  That would definitely prove it.  You going to give it a try?  I don't know.  I think I would lose a radio pal, to be honest with you.  Hey, hey, hey.  No problem.  Take it easy.  There would be two radio shows in the New York market, the Opie show and the Anthony show.  And we'd be going at each other's throats.  All right.  Keep the phone calls coming for suggestions of what Gary could get Anthony to do here. 
[02:14:00]  212-757-1027.  Gary Conrad performing at Rascals Comedy Club all weekend long, starting tonight.  You can call Rascals for ticket info, okay?  And as we go to break here, a lot of people are requesting the 12-year-old talking about seeing his parents have sex.  We've got to play this one more time.  And we'll be back.  How many more minutes do we need, Rick?  What did he say?  About 10 or 15 minutes.  He just did the got-to-know-you session.  Okay.  He just needed to use the bathroom. 
[02:14:30]  That's what he was going to do.  Oh, really?  But, yeah, he's going to start to relax them next.  So, probably another 10 or 15 minutes.  All right.  Did he tell you anything about Anthony?  Uh, no.  Damn.  He didn't say anything about anybody.  All right.  He seems confident, though.  Stop jinxing it, Opie.  Opie's dying here.  I'm dying.  I'm jinking it, man.  I'm not jinxing it.  They can't hear us in there.  You never know.  Somebody might open the door and he'll hear your voice say, oh, you know, we got to do it.  Right, right.  It's like, oh.  This will be amazing radio if he goes under.  Unbelievable.  You know what we need, though?  Huh?  Anthony has done a lot of stuff on the air. 
[02:15:00]  He said a lot of things that he would never, ever do.  If anybody remembers stuff in particular that we could have him do, that would be awesome.  That's a great idea.  We need your help today, guys.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We go to break listening to Keith talk about his parents having sex from a little while ago.  It's worth a replay.  Check it out.  Go ahead, Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, well, you're saying how horrible it's to see your mom's boobs.  Yeah, if you inadvertently see your mom's boobs.  What?  Seeing your mom and dad do commando on the bed.  Commando!  What happened, Keith? 
[02:15:30]  Oh, God.  I tried to forget it.  What happened?  You walked in on him?  Oh, yeah.  Early Saturday morning.  You opened it?  You just flung the door open?  Opened it.  Was mom taking it from behind or what?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, what was happening?  Yeah, what position were they in, Keith?  Feet over their shoulders.  Whoa!  Wow!  That's the, hi, how you doing?  Is your dad hung? 
[02:16:00]  Huh?  Oh.  Is your dad hung?  I don't know.  But, like, were they making noise or anything?  It was pretty embarrassing, huh?  My mom's a professional.  She was moaning, huh?  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  And then what happened when they saw you?  Well, their back was kind of facing to me, so I managed to get out.  Oh, they didn't see you?  They were there?  They didn't ask you to join them?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, man, you got, who are you, Rick, today? 
[02:16:30]  Taking it too far?  I took a hit on the head this morning.  I'm terrible.  Think I'm spaz?  This kid's quick.  Even 12-year-olds think I'm good on spaz.  So, did you enjoy it?  I mean, was that the first time you ever seen, you know, people having sex?  Oh, yeah, I guess.  Yeah, that sounds awful.  You'll remember that for the rest of your life.  Yeah.  Has your dad told you about the birds and the bees yet?  Actually, my brother did.  What did he tell you? 
[02:17:00]  Well, let's start with this question, what hole does he go into?  I thought I said, whatever one's open.  Oh, my God.  Is your dad's name Jackie?  No, not that one. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Keith, you're all right, man.  I guess you'll do okay.  All right.  Anything else?  Rather not say.  Okay.  You guys suck.  All right.  So does your mom, Keith.  Call back any time, all right?  Okay.  All right.  There he goes.  Keith, everyone.  He's pretty funny.  He's very funny.  He's a funny little lad.  Bill. 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  Usually I say, hey, Ed.  Diamond Vision and Dr. Phil it's off, Bill.  Yes.  Do you notice something?  You haven't been here in a while?  Do I notice something?  No.  What?  Something different on the Opster.  No.  No glasses.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I wanted to talk to you about that.  I wanted to talk to you about that.  Thank God you don't look at me that closely. 
[02:18:30]  You just passed the test.  Yeah.  I had the laser vision correction thing two and a half weeks ago, Bill.  Mm-hmm.  I came into the show, and I broke my glasses live in the air.  Don't need them anymore.  I got 2015 vision.  I would love to do that.  You got glasses on you?  I would love to do that.  I could drive at night.  Everything is crystal clear.  It's unbelievable.  Okay.  The doctor, Dr. Phil it off, he's performed over 1,000 of these procedures.  He's been doing it for a very long time. 
[02:19:00]  He takes his time.  He makes you feel good, because I was a nervous wreck, to tell you the truth.  Right.  And he calmed me down, and the procedure was like a piece of cake, and now I got great vision.  Well, knowing you, I know that you probably did a lot of research on this and came up with the best guy.  Very good.  Bravo, Bill.  Okay.  Actually, I researched it for about 10 months, because I was that freaked about it.  Uh-huh.  Because some of the things they do, it could be scary, but then you have someone like Dr. Phil it off talk you through it, and then you're like, oh, that's no big deal at all.  Right.  And now I got the great vision, and I want to share it with our listeners. 
[02:19:30]  So check this out.  For Valentine's Day, in honor of Valentine's Day, Diamond Vision would like to give the gift of sight.  That's right.  The gift of sight.  Contact Diamond Vision and Dr. Phil it off.  He's going to put you in the running for a complimentary vision correction and a free exam.  Not everyone can afford this procedure, so this is the doctor's way of saying thank you to the Opie and Anthony show and their fans.  He sounds like the man.  He's a very good guy, very down to earth.  So if you want to be in the running for a free correction, you've got to give Diamond Vision a call right now. 
[02:20:00]  1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020 for Diamond Vision and Dr. Phil it off.  That number, once again, 1-800-984-2020.  And if you need that number, just email me, and I'd be happy to give it to you, okay?  All right.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're getting very excited.  It looks like Gary Conrad is getting close.  I have no clue if Anthony is getting hypnotized, but it's looking pretty good in there, I've got to say. 
[02:20:30]  What do you think, Rick?  Okay, from what I've seen, I remember him doing this last time.  It's after he's had us start breathing a certain way and relaxing,  and right now it's just putting in regular suggestions to get us used to doing stuff.  All right.  Well, how much longer do you think?  Probably another 5 or 10-minute stops.  Okay, very good.  Anthony, of course, the skeptic.  Gary Conrad is going to attempt to prove him wrong.  I went on record earlier in the show and said there's no way Anthony's going to go under.  No way. 
[02:21:00]  Because he's not that trusting.  I know.  You know, you really got to, you know, trust the person that is putting you under.  Did you see that?  He just pulled one guy and pulled him down.  What does that mean?  It's weird.  It could be about 5 minutes now.  Oh, really?  From what I'm seeing.  All right.  This guy's in there drumming on their knees.  Watch this.  Watch this.  Watch this.  All right.  He's getting close to Ant.  All right.  He's like talking to the guy right next to Ant.  Okay.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  He's in front of Anthony.  He's in front of Anthony. 
[02:21:30]  We'll be able to tell if the odds are good here.  You know what I remember too right now?  He's probably not.  Wait.  Here he goes.  Shh.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Oh, man.  You fought it.  You fought it.  Oh, son of a bitch fought it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Jesus.  And, like, he went for the move.  He went for the move, and usually, as you saw with the other guys, their necks were like, 
[02:22:00]  and heads were totally loose, and they were, like, wobbling, almost like the little guy  in the back of the car.  All right.  He went to do that to Ant, and Ant was like a freaking robot.  Jesus Christ.  And we were hoping.  He went for the move because, like, he holds you, and then, like, he pulls you down, and  if you're under hypnosis, you go for it.  He did that move to you, and we're like, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.  Like, all of a sudden, we see your head just go, nope, and you just shook it back and forth. 
[02:22:30]  Nope.  I honestly gave it a try, the whole thing.  I wasn't thinking anything else.  I was really trying.  I was relaxed.  I did everything he said.  Oh, we were so hopeful.  It just wasn't working.  I mean, the other guys seemed to be under.  I don't know.  Whatever.  You know?  Did you feel anything in there at all?  I mean, you know.  I started thinking of, like, some sex, and started going.  Well, see, that's the problem.  You've got to get your...  It's not like getting a boner.  No.  You've got to stop thinking about sex for five minutes, and then maybe you would be able 
[02:23:00]  to go under your head.  Okay, you know.  If you were married, you wouldn't be thinking about sex.  Is that it, Rick?  I mean, what was going on in there, Ed?  Um, you know, just relaxing everybody, getting everyone in tune, I guess, with him and his  voice, and I don't know what the whole mumbo-jumbo is behind it, but he was doing it, and, you  know, people are responding.  Uh-huh.  So, I don't know.  I wasn't...  Were you looking around the room going, uh...  No, I wasn't looking.  My eyes were shut. 
[02:23:30]  I was completely...  I was hoping something would happen where I would just go, oh, oh, my God.  Look, I'm hypnotized.  Yeah.  Damn.  Did you at any point say to yourself, what is all this mumbo-jumbo?  Yes, I use the word mumbo-jumbo, as a matter of fact.  And we had people calling up with some great suggestions for you.  Oh, really?  For things you would do under hypnosis.  Really?  Like have Spaz and Anthony on the Lesbo couch.  Have Anthony caress a Ricky Martin picture. 
[02:24:00]  Have Anthony ask out Psycho Patty.  Have Anthony lick the Spaz couch.  Have Anthony ride the jet ski.  Even if it does work, it's hypnotism, not a gun to my head.  Okay?  Have Anthony cry over his wife.  Have Anthony tell everyone that he really thinks Tubby Tom Show is really good.  Well, I do.  You sure you're not under hypnosis right now?  No.  Oh, well.  Missing it.  Call the ex and ask her to get back together. 
[02:24:30]  Whoa.  Jesus Christ.  And we would have known you was hypnotized.  Bill.  I was bummed.  I was enjoying the Opie and Cowbill Bill show.  Yeah.  You guys having fun?  I think it's true.  Bill's a good guy.  I was on the phone for a few seconds.  Oh, yeah?  Cool.  He didn't help me out with my live read, though.  Oh, what did you have to do?  You know, usually it's like, hey, Anthony, diamond vision.  Yeah.  Ah, Opie, diamond vision.  Opie had it done.  What did Bill do?  Bill was like, yes, so what? 
[02:25:00]  Then I go, diamond vision.  I had that the other night at the bar.  It looked like I was looking to a kaleidoscope.  I set him up.  I go, Bill, you notice anything different about me?  He's like staring for like two minutes.  I'm like, help me out here, pal.  He goes on the hole.  That's your cue to say, wow, you're not wearing glasses.  Totally, totally didn't get that.  Dude, I'm just messing with you, man.  So are they closer?  I did fine after that.  Yeah, you did very well. 
[02:25:30]  It's nothing in your resume, Bill.  He actually played along after that.  Anthony, I think we need to take a quick break, because I believe he's about ready to march these people into the studio.  All right.  We're still going to have fun with Gary Conrad, even though Anthony did not go under.  Yeah, sorry.  You know, like I said, I really tried.  They were going to make you kiss spaz, somebody said on the instant feedback.  They're just suggesting things, Anthony.  That's great.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to have you try the chicken dance.  Which I don't do at weddings or anything else. 
[02:26:00]  All right, let's take a break.  Spaz is in there.  He's hypnotized again.  He's always a lot of fun when he's under hypnosis.  We've got Steve from the unofficial website, and I believe, what, how many listeners are in there, Anthony?  Three or four, I think.  All right, so it'll still be a lot of fun, so stay right there.  We'll be back, hopefully, with Gary Conrad, live in the studio with his subjects.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  What do you do this?  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  107-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony. 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  There's my pal.  Oh, come on.  Look at Bill getting the heat over here.  Oh, Bill.  But we've been doing it for five and a half years.  Maybe it was something that, I mean, the Diamond Vision thing is great.  Opie loves it, took care of his eyes and everything.  Bill hasn't had it, so he doesn't know he can't relate to that.  I think this, though.  You can relate to?  Oh, my God.  Playboystore.com.  Now you're talking.  Now you're talking something Bill can relate to.  There you go.  Valentine's Day.  You know that big pig of a woman you took to bed last week? 
[02:27:00]  It took me to bed.  Yes.  Okay.  You can get her something, maybe some Playboy brand lingerie.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they've got to have a variety of sizes here.  Yeah, some apparel, jewelry, and the famous 14-caric old rabbit head necklace.  Uh-huh.  Fat babes need loving, too.  That's right.  Do they offer a 14-caric old pork chop around a chain?  That might be better for that girl.  But for your sexy girl at home, the rabbit head, make her look like a Playmate.  Also, the Playboy best-kept sex secrets video.

He'll be entering the studio in minutes.  Stay there.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on 1027 WNEW. 
[02:29:00]  We're waiting for Mr. Conrad.  Looks like he's just about ready, Anthony.  With the rest of his subjects.  Yes, he's playing Rascals Comedy Club all weekend long, starting tonight.  Call up Rascals for the ticket info.  A couple erotic shows in there as well.  Oh.  What does he make them do?  I don't know.  The erotic shows.  You can only imagine it.  All right.  Bend over the chair.  Put your drawers down.  I wish we had a number for Rascals so you guys could call up for the ticket info. 
[02:29:30]  I know they're listening, so send it on the S&P feedback.  He has the number, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, once he gets in there.  He'll plug it.  All right.  His subjects have stood up, Anthony.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Look at Spaz.  Spaz just fell down.  He just walked into the wall.  I swear to God.  Spaz is a mess.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Entering the studio, Gary Conrad, everyone.  All right.  He's lining up his subjects, Anthony. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at Spaz.  Okay.  Look at Spaz.  All right.  He's got three subjects.  Spaz is completely out of it.  Come on.  He's like a zombie.  He's like a zombie.  Keep watching my hand.  I'm a hotball.  He's going to rise and empty.  Then let it go.  All right.  He's putting on the finishing touches of the hypnosis, I'm just, like, slamming up Spaz's face. 
[02:30:30]  Get the hell out of here.  Come on.  I still don't buy it.  Don't buy it.  What?  I don't buy it.  No way.  I know.  He's prepping them, I guess.  Yes.  Spaz's face is hysterical.  I've got to give him that.  Oh, man.  He's a mess.  Look at him. 
[02:31:00]  That was easy.  Maybe it's easier because he's asleep five hours of the day during the show.  Feeling good in every way.  I'm a little louder.  I'm a little louder.  I'm a little louder.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Mr. Conrad.  Gary Conrad in the studio.  Yeah, I apologize.  Jump ship.  I was really giving it a try.  I said I got a bag with a million dollars cash in it with your name on it in my hotel room. 
[02:31:30]  Think.  Think of how it would apply if you were to say, oh, I'll try to be there.  I'll try to be there.  Hey, I still believe you, Gary.  Still believe in this stuff.  Rick, you want some of this stuff?  No.  That's okay.  We're going for a win.  All right.  So we've got three subjects today.  Yeah, three subjects.  Okay.  You know the phone number of rascals because a bunch of people have been calling them for  that.  Excuse me.  973 is the area code.  736-2726.  Okay, good. 
[02:32:00]  And you're there all weekend starting tonight?  736-2726.  We're in West Orange up until Saturday.  Then Ocean, New Jersey down to show up one show Sunday.  All right.  You've got to save Spaz for last, Gary.  I think I'm going to take Spaz on the road with me.  I think y'all are going to lose them.  I don't know if Rick gave you the note, but February is Black History Month.  We want Spaz to act black.  You want Spaz to be a black man?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's keep that in mind.  Okay.  Well, you will do that real quick. 
[02:32:30]  Can I get some?  We'll be kind enough, buddy.  Go out here and get my black bag that was in there.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  All right.  We're going to do something.  I want to do something with Spaz.  You want a black guy?  He's going to be a teacher.  Steve, move that mic around so we get him on mic.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  He's got a suitcase.  You got your TV screen filled with stuff, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right.  Spaz.  On three, your eyes are open.  It's February. 
[02:33:00]  It's Black History Month.  I'm just putting a little Black History hat on there, man.  Spaz.  On three, your eyes are open.  And you're giving lessons to everybody on the air about Black History Month.  Only Spaz eyes open.  Everybody else keep humming and internalizing.  Spaz.  Only eyes open on three.  And it's time for your speech, Dr. Spaz.  One, two, three.  Eyes open, people.  It's Dr. Spaz.  Yeah, Dr. Spaz.  Woo!  Woo!  I'm here today to educate you students on Black History Month. 
[02:33:30]  Now, a lot of you have been hearing the word.  What a dog.  Nigger.  Oh, my God.  All throughout your life.  Now, to me, I'm a well-educated black man.  That's why I'm here today.  Teaching you about Black History Month.  There is no such word as the word nigger.  The word nigger is represented by the white folk here in America.  But can we have the good dog to put him away for a minute?  What I'm going to tell you is to educate to deal with these ignorant white folk that use the word nigger. 
[02:34:00]  Then when they choose the word, use the word nigger.  Now, I know a lot of you out there have been involved in many fights because of your 200 years of aggression.  So white folk don't want to hear that line anymore.  Oh, that line will just get you into trouble.  Now, I'm here to save you from many fights in the future.  Anthony has a question, sir.  Anthony has a question.  You have a question, son? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, because you're not going to throw off the air, please.  What kind of a question is that?  I'm here to present you with information to save you from trouble, son.  Where'd you get the hat?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, man.  Oh, jeez.  We're still on, right?  Yeah, we're still on, barely.  Gary Conrad.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Now, listen up.  On three, Pedro.  On three, your eyes are going to be going to come over here.  One of our listeners, Pedro. 
[02:35:00]  In honor of your lovely noticing, you're going to be James Brown.  You're going to be singing for us, dancing, and talking for us on three.  Pedro, James Brown, one of the...  Eyes open, James Brown.  What's up?  I feel good.  I'm right.  I'm right.  Woo.  Woo.  You know, I tell about it.  I can't even say it.  James Brown.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I feel good.  I knew that I would.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Come on, baby.  Oh, I'm the man.  You told James Brown was that?  Oh, no more.  No more.  Now, you're up. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, no more.  Pedro, your eyes are very much more flamboyant, even.  You're Tom Likas.  One, two, three.  Eyes open.  Hello, everybody.  This is Tom Likas.  And I've been hypnotized with OB and OB.  Not to suck.  Hello, hello, America.  What's that one?  All right, let me tell you something.  This is Likas 101.  They are my friends.  I like them all.  I like them all.  I can feel my hips.  I can feel everything of me.  Women serve me, baby.  Yeah.  All right, everybody. 
[02:36:00]  Likas 101.  Man talk like them.  Very good.  That's Pedro.  One of our restaurants.  John Rocker, you're talking about.  When I start snapping, you turn into a Japanese kamikaze pilot.  John Rocker.  One, two, three.  Eyes open.  John Rocker.  Oh, let me tell you something, everybody.  This is not the regular rocker you're used to.  I ride the subway and I see these Italians.  What is going on with that?  Raze, pizzeria, everywhere.  Everywhere in New York. 
[02:36:30]  All right, leave you to Jersey and I sometimes.  Just back up.  Back up.  Eyes open.  Oh, wow.  I can't wait for him to get back to Spaz.  Hang on.  A little more Spaz, Gary.  A little more Spaz.  Listen, Spaz, your eyes are open.  You're going to feel good.  You talk to Hopi and Anthony, but every time I snap my fingers, you're going to realize  you lost another hand at strip poker and you're just going to remove an item. 
[02:37:00]  Just every time I snap my fingers twice, Spaz, you do it just like it's nothing.  Everybody else keeps their eyes closed.  One, two, three.  Eyes open, Spaz.  Now, you were just talking to Anthony over here about the monster.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Damn.  He's taking his shirt off.  He says it's cold or something.  Well, you got a problem with the coat?  Well, yeah, it's pretty cold out if you go outside.  You see?  Oh, God, wait a minute.  He's taking off his shoes now.  Steve's getting this for the unofficial Opie and Anthony website. 
[02:37:30]  I think he's losing in strip poker, Anthony.  A room full of guys.  This is great.  What's the problem with February again?  Well, you know, I just hope it ends real quick.  Because he's taking his jeans off.  Gary, you got to go the distance.  You got to go the distance.  I think you're a chicken, Spaz.  One, two, three.  You're a chicken. 
[02:38:00]  We're a chicken.  We're a chicken.  Colonel Sanders.  Get over here.  Colonel Sanders.  Get over here.  Buck the shorts.  I'm not a chicken.  What a friggin' tool.  If I got to go through your rooster, give us a Big Crow.  One, two, three.  Big crow.  Like a wolf. 
[02:38:30]  This is boxing shorts in the corner.  I hope he's got some chicken feet.  No, no, no.  I hope he's got some corn feet.  Gary, I'm the one that believes this crap.  Don't make him do this.  Get away!  That's not the pecker.  He's pecking at him.  He's pecking at him.  Get your pecker away from me. 
[02:39:00]  Now, Anthony got some corn.  Anthony got some corn.  Anthony's got the prime corn.  Anthony's got the good corn.  You've got to see this.  You've got to see this.  That away, that away.  Yeah, go get the skeptics.  It's in his box.  It's running around like a chicken trying to find Anthony.  Okay.  Holy cow.  And it's safe to come back.  Oh, man.  Holy cow.  I can't think, though.  Where is that?  He's in the Dell.  I'm not letting Spazzis pecker near me. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, do we have that thing here?  Yes, we do.  Listen, Spazzis, on three, your eyes are open.  You're going to realize you were just the star in a basketball game.  We're here in a locker room.  Everybody got changed, but you were a little slower getting changed.  One day, eyes open.  Hey, good game, Spazz.  Good game, man.  That was a very good game.  Yeah.  Scored the winning shot.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  Closed on, old buddy, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's closed on.  It's closed on game.  Scored the winning shot.  Yeah, pretty good.  Spazzis finally putting his clothes back on. 
[02:40:00]  How'd you do that layup?  Oh, it's easy going through there, defense.  I told you before and again that we beat their asses, and we did.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Open it.  You came out.  Listen, on three, Joe, you're Eddie Murphy.  You're Eddie Murphy into the microphone.  Joe, what do you think?  I love an Eddie Murphy right into the microphone.  Ma, throw down some money.  I see men is coming.  Give me a total time of all.  Bring me back my change.  And you run down the block as fast as you can chasing that guy. 
[02:40:30]  And you know.  You know he sees you coming because he goes top speed.  Lying at them.  Can't do a song, boss.  And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, we're getting a change.  Thank you.  Thank you, very much.  Thank you, very much.  Thank you, very much.  Thank you, very much.  Uh, I have some ice cream.  I have some ice cream.  You don't want to have some ice cream.  You have some ice cream.  Hey, do it in Chinese, won't you think?  Sing that song in Chinese. 
[02:41:00]  Now back to English.  Back to English.  Back to English.  Back to the boys.  All right.  Very good.  Joe, one of our listeners.  Steve, uh, film and all this for the unofficial Opium Anthony website.  Listen, on three Joe eyes open, uh, cowboy's got.  He's wearing ladies underwear at one degree.  Eyes open.  What the heck is that?  What the heck is with that guy?  What do you call that thing over there?  Are you a fan? 
[02:41:30]  Anthony's got a shorter version on.  Same style, but different version.  How about it?  You like these, huh?  They're together, don't they?  Yeah.  I'm a fan.  He's calling you guys a fan.  Yeah.  That's what he's wearing.  You like them, don't you?  I like a teddy with the fluff around the legs.  I like it.  It's comfy.  It's got a teddy on.  He's got, like, a hanging one off his shoulders.  I like a lodge.  Why do they dress like this?  Oh, it feels good.  Got to be ready.  You're wearing ladies underwear as one, two, three.  Eyes open. 
[02:42:00]  Ah, look at you.  Look at what you got on.  I get it, man.  What the hell are you?  How you doing, man?  Look at you, you fake.  It's a subtle look on his face.  Facts is like practicing jump shots in the corner.  All right, here's, this is going to be good.  We've got the blow-up doll in the studio.  All right, Spaz, on three, your eyes are open.  And, uh, hold that right there for me, buddy. 
[02:42:30]  All right.  On three, your eyes are open.  You're going to realize there's a naked chick to your left over there, and she's got the  hots for you.  You're going to be as calm and suave and debonair as you possibly can be, Spaz.  And, uh, every time I snap my fingers like this, she grabs you someplace, Spaz.  Every time I snap my fingers like that, chick grabs you somewhere.  I want to do it.  All right.  Yeah.  I'll take a little blow-up, Tom.  All right.  What's this, guys? 
[02:43:00]  What's up?  Can I get you a drink?  Where's your time?  She can only hear you when you're talking there.  She's got a hearing problem.  Yeah.  Can I get you a drink?  Can I hear a little bit too well?  Whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We don't know each other that well, honey.  Don't jump the gun, honey, all right?  She's coming over.  Just wanted to get to know you for who you are.  Oh.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Honey, honey, honey.  Not the package.  I can't get the jewels yet.  All right? 
[02:43:30]  All right.  Now, just tell me a little bit about yourself.  Where are you from?  I'm right here, all right?  Splitting with a blow-up, Tom.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Honey.  Honey, come on.  We're home later, but we've got to do the chit-chat thing first.  Boy, isn't he smooth.  All right.  Go a little bit too advanced there.  I hope that 12-year-old is listening.  This is good.  I don't move along that fast.  Good education, bro.  You've got to take this thing slow.  What, you want the ringer ready?  Come on. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  What?  Move over.  So, what's your name?  Actually, by the count of your eyes are open, you're going to realize you're...  Whoa, don't push your head through the window.  On three of your eyes are open, you're going to realize you're Anthony.  That chick is Anthony's girlfriend, and you're picking her up.  One, two, three.  Eyes open.  It's Anthony's chick you got there.  Is Anthony around?  No, Anthony's not around.  My wife?  No, listen.  You know how Anthony's got the little radio show? 
[02:44:30]  You know, and I work for him and everything.  I know you may think I'm just a phone screener now.  But I'm telling you, I have my points on that show.  I'm sure you've probably heard of me.  You know that guy's spadging here on the radio?  Oh.  Oh, God.  I'm him.  I'll do it.  I've never known.  Try to pick up the board, though.  Some of those calls are, you know, like.  The show can't keep rolling, so.  The ball of doll's falling for it. 
[02:45:00]  He's got that.  Anthony's got the voices in there.  He's a little bit older.  He's got some excess baggage.  Moving on, me on.  Excess baggage is between my legs.  You lack it this best.  So, how's it about it?  Come on, you don't really want him now, do you?  The ponytail thing is that?  Oh, look.  Look at the ball of doll's leaving.  Every time I...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It would fall for me, but not that fast. 
[02:45:30]  Statistically, statistically.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  Eyes on three, eyes open.  Every time I snap my fingers, cowboys had a gas attack.  Oh, boy.  Eyes open, take a look at this one.  What the heck?  Oh, man.  Sorry, guys.  That dude stinks.  I love that.  Man, I'm kidding you.  What?  Jesus Christ, man.  You get some ventilation in this place? 
[02:46:00]  Yo, we're proud, Joe.  You need some money.  Whoa.  I'm a direct beat.  Oh, Jesus.  I thought I was bad, man.  What?  The white castle?  You made a trip to white castle?  Eyes so spaz.  When I snap my fingers spaz, you think it smells good.  Everybody else knows it stinks.  It's going to be big.  Eyes open, man.  What's going on, Andrew?  You get too much coffee out there, man.  What are you talking about, man?  Oh, man. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, it's moving in at Chili's, man.  What's up with that?  It stinks, dude.  I don't know what you're talking about.  You smell special roast, dude.  What are you talking about?  It doesn't smell, man.  Artex.  You're smelling things, man.  You're smelling and dying.  I'm smelling crappy frozen.  Sure you have.  Sure you have.  You're going to be the money naked.  Now, I'm going to go.  Now, I'm going to go.  Now, I'm going to go.  All right.  Let's set up.  Spaz, I'm through your eyes of rope.  And every time Opie says 102.7, Spaz, you realize 
[02:47:00]  you become another month pregnant.  You become another month pregnant.  Every time Opie says the term 102.7, and after that third time,  you're going to feel a little kickings further up,  and you're going to feel a little rumblings in your belly.  And by the ninth time he says 102.7, you're going to lay on the ground here.  You're going to have the baby right here.  And everything else is going to be normal for you.  I'm going to do the eyes open feeling good. 
[02:47:30]  You know, I do so many radio stations.  I didn't know what one I was on.  I know you're at WNEWFM, but what are you on?  No, we're 102.7 there, Gary.  Okay.  Spaz, what's the problem?  What was I?  I didn't hear that.  It's 102.7, Gary Conrad, in the studio.  So when they give the call letters, it's WNEWFM.  102.7.  I see.  Spaz, what's the problem?  Nothing.  I think it may be something I ate.  I don't know.  It's just nothing of fun.  102.7, Spaz.  We're trying to do a radio show here.  You're distracting me.  Now I have to say the call letters again. 
[02:48:00]  102.7.  Spaz, what's wrong?  Something's kicking in my stomach.  Well, we're trying to do a radio show.  102.7, WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Spaz, you're really distracting me.  Now I have to say it again.  102.7.  102.7.  He's on the floor.  Spaz, what's going on down there?  102.7.  102.7.  102.7.  You're a doctor. 
[02:48:30]  Pull it out, pull it out.  He's got breastfeeding that.  Spaz just gave birth and now he's making a breastfeeding the baby.  It's a rubber chicken.  He's got a great little thing to Velv's teeth and he bites you there, spaz, one, two, three. 
[02:49:00]  Ooh, just bit him.  You're going to get arrested.  He's pressed.  Rock the baby.  This is so wrong. 
[02:49:30]  Rock the baby.  You stand up, stand up.  Your vibes will carry you.  You stand up.  Yes, stand up.  Is this your first?  Yes.  Does it seem to resemble you?  Who does the baby resemble more, you or the other parent?  More like the other parent.  I remember going through his pain again.  If he wants another baby, he's not having another one.  What are you going to name it?  Junior. 
[02:50:00]  Congratulations, Doc.  Good job.  Stand asleep, Doc.  Stand asleep.  Oh, my God.  He's caressing a rubber chicken.  You better burp the baby now.  Burp it.  Burp it.  A little lullaby to the baby.  A little lullaby to the baby.  Baby does mess all over you, Spaz.  Oh, baby does mess all over you. 
[02:50:30]  All over you.  It's okay.  I'll take care of it.  No problem.  Mommy will be fine.  He's changing a diaper on a rubber chicken.  Mommy wipe himself first.  For those of you keeping track at home.  Mommy wipe himself first.  He's a mommy, Anthony.  He's wiping the diarrhea off his chest.  Spaz's going to be a good parent.  Look at that.  He has a diaper on that. 
[02:51:00]  Improvise it all.  Is he so precious?  Yeah, yeah.  Precious, man.  All right.  The sand is like sand.  All over right to the wall.  Listen, I'll throw everybody's eyes open, and you just saw your parents do something that  you never thought you would ever see your parents do it, and you want to report it first. 
[02:51:30]  We're going to start with Joe.  Joe, your parents did something you never thought they'd see them do, and you're going  to tell us about it.  When did they?  Eyes open, Joe.  Now, come on over here.  You were saying about your parents?  Oh, man.  I came up from school, and I caught them.  It wasn't good.  What were they doing?  Mom was bent over.  Man, they were having sex.  Mom was taken from behind.  I never seen that.  It's disgusting.  I don't even want to talk about it.  It's disgusting.  It was gross.  Getting a jackhammer.  It'll last forever. 
[02:52:00]  Did they know you were there?  I can't believe I've seen this.  Did they see you there?  No, man.  I just walked in.  I caught them in the bedroom.  All right.  Pedro, I threw your eyes open.  One of their eyes open.  Now, what were you saying, Pedro, about your parents were doing something?  So, my father's dressed up in a pink bunny suit.  My mother feeded him carrots.  What's up with that, dude?  Wag, man.  I tell you, I've never seen anything like that before.  It was a Christmas story nightmare.  I'm telling you.  Nightmare.  What's the style?  Amazing.  You want to just sit here right back here?  You're right back here standing. 
[02:52:30]  And here comes Spaz again.  You guys saw me.  All right.  Does Spaz ever have parents?  Yeah, you've got parents.  You have parents.  All right, Spaz, on three of your eyes are open up.  That's what you saw your parents do and you never thought you would see them do.  I want to do eyes.  I don't know Spaz.  What?  You were talking about your parents?  Oh, yeah.  This is kind of embarrassing, dude.  My parents, you know, I come home, like, one day, like, back when I was going to school  in elementary school.  I come home and I see them.  They're playing with little dolls. 
[02:53:00]  Really?  They're playing with dolls.  But the freaky part is that whatever they make the dolls do, they do it themselves.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, let's say, like, they make the dolls do, like, some crazy sexual position.  All right?  Something crazy gets in their heads.  Or, like, they happen to have Barbie walk over to a bedpost and screw a bedpost.  Yeah.  Then, I see, I overhear this, and I see this, by the way, one of them tells mom, say, okay,  well, Barbie screwed the bedpost.  I got an idea, honey. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Go screw the bedpost.  What did my mom do right in front of me screw the bedpost?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but what freaks me out is that they see me out of the corner of the eye and continue  to do it without telling me to leave.  Really?  Yeah.  Take a little spaz off.  I can't believe it.  I'm going to put you back in your toy box. 
[02:54:00]  That's pretty well.  Listen, guys, I'm through your eyes open.  You'll be talking to Opie and Anthony.  Every time I snap my fingers, one of your body parts gets either larger or smaller.  I'm three eyes open, gang.  One, two, three.  Eyes open, feeling good.  All right.  It's WNAW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got the guys in the studio here.  You guys having a good time today?  Wow, what's the problem?  What's the problem?  You've got a giant foot, man.  Check this out. 
[02:54:30]  You've got a giant foot?  Giant foot, man.  Hey, Gerald, let's see the giant foot, man.  I could kick some serious soccer balls when he says that.  Wow, look at that thing, man.  Dude, it's bigger than it usually is.  It's huge, man.  It's huge.  Spaz, what's the problem?  It's kind of embarrassing.  What's wrong?  Well, I wouldn't want his giant foot to hit me in my small, you know, swing.  You've got a small penis?  Whoa.  Why are you turning your back?  No reason.  No reason.  No reason.  Joe, what's going on, Joe? 
[02:55:00]  Joe?  What about your belly button?  What's wrong with your belly button, Joe?  It's getting smaller.  It's getting smaller.  It's gone.  It's gone.  Joe, I'm through your real eyes.  Rick stole your belly button.  One, two, three.  Rick's got your belly button right now.  Dude, what are you doing?  I need that.  I got my belly button, man.  Rick got your belly button.  Do it. 
[02:55:30]  Stomach got your belly button.  He's right.  I'll give it back later.  Stand asleep, Joe.  Stand asleep.  Stand asleep.  Spaz, eyes closed.  I'm through your eyes, Rope,  and you realize that Anthony stole your social organ.  One, two, three.  Ah, I know, man.  Anthony got your...  So, Anthony, I thought you were...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's okay.  I'll leave it in your mailbox.  You can pick it up later.  I heard these...  Catch it from me.  All right.  Well, now you're a chicken again,  giving new meaning to that term, one, two, three.  You're a chicken again. 
[02:56:00]  Anthony got corn for you.  Anthony got that sweet corn.  Spaz is running after Anthony.  He caught him.  He just got caught him.  He's stuck back there now.  Okay.  They're behind the equipment.  Anthony has escaped.  Spaz is like...  Now you're a duck.  You're a duck, Spaz.  One, two, three.  You're a duck.  You're a duck, Spaz.  You're a duck.  All right.  Spaz is making his way from the... 
[02:56:30]  Behind the equipment.  Now you realize you're a disco duck.  Stand up and dance.  You're a disco duck.  Stand up and...  He's doing a disco dance.  Spaz, Spaz, Spaz.  Oh, Spaz.  Spaz, Spaz.  Oh, very nice.  All right.  Spaz is out cold again. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, goodness.  Very funny, Gary.  Very funny.  Spaz, I'm going to throw your eyes open.  You think you had a little accident there, and you should have had your diapers on.  You're 99 years old, Spaz.  You're running high.  I know.  That prostate just doesn't do it like it used to.  So I threw your eyes open, Spaz.  You're 90 years old, and you realize you had a little accident.  One, two, three.  Hey, guys.  Old man Spaz here.  Hey, Spaz.  Hey, Spaz.  Old man Spaz.  I think I have to go to the bathroom. 
[02:57:30]  I had an accident.  Excuse me, Phil, sir.  Let me ask you one thing, Spaz.  Now that you're in your 90s, if you had to do it all over again, what would you have done different?  Probably not be such a prick, my uncle.  What did you do so bad? 
[02:58:00]  I didn't have to try.  I didn't give you an advice, old man.  You didn't crap here.  What about the days on the O.P. Anthony show?  How were they?  In retrospect.  Fine memories.  Fine memories.  Were they fulfilling?  Learning experience.  Very much learning experience.  What do you think about Anthony?  Wow.  He's long gone now, so you can sit.  Quiet time.  Never really said much. 
[02:58:30]  Many McDonald's runs.  That's what I remember.  McDonald's.  Going to McDonald's a lot.  What was O.P. like in that day?  He gave me a lot of good advice for radio.  What about Rick the producer?  He was one of my favorites.  Oh, Rick.  I consider it, but looking back, it was tough love.  It was tough love.  He said Rick gave him a lot of ass.  And he had to dump out.  Very funny. 
[02:59:00]  All right, bye.  You're dry now, and you can stand and speak with your legs firm beneath.  Your legs firm beneath.  Spaz, I'm through your eyes.  You think you're the Easter Bunny.  You pop around a room, wonder.  There are eyes on Spaz.  You're the Easter Bunny.  Oh, no.  He's underneath that.  He's underneath that.  Be careful.  He's a freaking lunatic.  Up around the whole state.  Now you realize you're a kangaroo and you're shadowboxing.  You're a kangaroo and you're shadowboxing.  Don't do anybody. 
[02:59:30]  He's like a kangaroo.  That's some room.  He's frightening, man.  That's some room.  Rick, you realize you're a crocodile hunter from Australia, one, two, three.  Talk to us over here, croc hunter.  Come over here, croc hunter.  Ain't she a beaut?  Look at the snout on that one over there.  Let us see it all right, mate.  Yeah.  Shh.  You want to scare them off?  Oh, good.  What are we hunting?  A crocodile. 
[03:00:00]  Now you got to sneak up in a real quiet life.  Like that one over there.  Shh.  She's eyeballed you.  You don't want me.  Sneak up in a little bugger.  Then you get right there.  Right through the...  Yeah, okay.  Through the brain.  Right through the brain.  He's going after that thing.  Okay, I'll be quiet. 
[03:00:30]  Freeze, fast.  Freeze, freeze, freeze.  Freeze.  I don't want him near me.  Anthony's behind the equipment again.  Spaz, on three, your eyes are open.  You think that the top of your foot's a cigarette lighter.  One, two, three.  Eyes open.  Take a look.  You just light that thing.  Whoa.  What's wrong, Spaz?  Spaz, what's wrong?  Spaz?  Spaz, what's going on, buddy?  What's on fire?  All right, Stanisley, Stanisley, Stanisley, Stanisley. 
[03:01:00]  Your legs are perfect.  All right, listen up, guys.  On three, your eyes are open.  You're going to feel great.  Uh, Joe, on three, your eyes are open.  You're going to realize that your shoes are saying insulting things to you.  Horrid, accusatory, falsehood things to you.  And Spaz, when your eyes are open, every time I snap my fingers with Joe, his shoes say nasty things to him.  But your shoes say 1-900 number things to you.  Spaz, one, two, three.  Eyes open.  And, uh...  Joe, asshole.  Joe, come over here, Joe.  I need you by the mic. 
[03:01:30]  Come over here, buddy.  He's cursing like...  Come over here.  The crazy man over there.  He's cursing out his sneakers.  Yeah.  I wish I could do that to you, honey.  Joe, where was your shoes?  Come over here, where was from?  Oh, paraphrase some of the things in speakable language.  He's calling me an a-hole.  Who?  Who's calling you that?  The green, huh?  The shoes.  Huh?  What's the problem? 
[03:02:00]  Dude, they're getting nasty, man.  They're saying all kinds of...  All right.  Spaz, look at your shoes.  Come over here.  Whoa.  What?  Yeah, it's hard.  Oh.  You take it off.  Leave the stockings off.  Leave the stockings off. 
[03:02:30]  Whoa.  Yeah, the pants are coming off.  I got the oils.  Spaz, on the counter, whatever your shoes are saying, you're now feeling it.  One, two, three.  Now you're feeling exactly what the shoes are saying.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Feels good stroking it.  Oh, some rice.  Come on, man.  Whoa, whoa.  You didn't need to hear that.  Whoa.  You got the push button, I hope. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, we got...  We're dumping out.  No problem.  Okay, cool.  Well, you got any callers?  Want them to do anything?  Um, yeah, we do, actually.  Try to think.  They wanted Spaz to kiss the doll.  Nah.  Nah, I don't want to do anything.  No?  No.  Well, Spaz, on three, your eyes are open.  You're right.  You just kissed the doll.  And a doll was the absolute best kisser you've ever come across in your life.  Tell us about it.  One, two, three.  Eyes up. 
[03:03:30]  I'm going, Spaz.  Whoa.  Oh.  That's all brings back memories.  Put your arm around her.  Put your arm around her.  You can get a little cozy with her.  A little friendly.  How do you know that doll?  Well, she's a doll.  Wow.  I'm embarrassed saying it, but, you know, I got in, you know, early and sawed it in the  corner of my office.  Yeah, yeah.  And, um, well, I stuck my tongue in the doll's mouth. 
[03:04:00]  Really?  Oh.  How was she?  Uh, the best kisser of any girlfriend I've ever had.  Well, you better not let that get out with some of your dates.  You're not going to appreciate that.  Well, I am dating one person.  Even hypnotized, you know, you better say that.  I feel embarrassed saying it, that I kissed a blow-up doll when my girlfriend would be 
[03:04:30]  listening.  Yeah.  Will you recommend other people try that?  Oh, yeah.  Anybody in the office.  I see.  Best kiss you're ever going to get.  Beats out any human.  Really?  Anything.  Really?  Obi, you want to try that?  Yeah, I know.  That's okay.  That's okay, Spaz.  It'll make your day, man.  No, that's all right.  Anthony's a skeptic.  What do you got to say to Anthony?  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, man?  Nothing beats a piece of plastic.  Yeah, I bet.  No, that's okay.  I think I'll...  I cleaned it. 
[03:05:00]  That's great, Spaz.  No, that's okay.  No, no, you take the doll with you.  Want to try later?  Yeah, yeah, maybe later.  Yeah, put it in the office.  Maybe I'll check it out later.  That's great.  No, very attractive doll.  Yeah, doll.  That's great.  Keep him away.  He falls down all over the place. 
[03:05:30]  What are we going to do with Spaz?  He's done a...  Oh, I got one.  You got one more for Spaz?  Yeah, one more.  Hey, Anthony, hold this, buddy.  I'll give you one, please.  Listen up, guys.  I'm through your eyes are open.  Every time Anthony tickles that Elmo doll, both you guys realize that you turn into Tickle Me Elmo dolls.  Now, he'll hold that doll with his right hand, but the minute he puts his left hand on that doll, both y'all will feel it exactly where it is being felt on that doll. 
[03:06:00]  One, two, three.  Eyes open, gang, feeling good.  That's how that Elmo, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  It's like a Tickle Me Elmo, right?  Yeah.  Oh, that's got to leave a mark when you flick the nose really hard like this.  Stop it, man.  How about when you punch it in the face like that?  You're just like, nail it in the face.  Right in the stomach.  There you go. 
[03:06:30]  That had to hurt.  Oh, they're on the floor.  Why'd you tickle his toes?  Tickle his toes.  He goes, oh, no, why don't we ram this thing where the sun doesn't shine?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I can't even describe what's going on.  But Steve is getting a great video of us.  Well, this has got to hurt the back of your head.  Oh, dude.  They're completely on the floor. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, oops.  That's going to hurt.  Whatever Anthony does in the dial is happening to the guys.  Yeah, uh-oh.  Try to make him stand up.  In the right, in the right.  No, whack him across the forehead.  Sleep, sleep, sleep.  Oh, very good.  Very good. 
[03:07:30]  What's that?  Uh-oh.  I threw your eyes are open.  And who's the guy you had on?  You had the one guy is the racist guy, and the other guy is the anti-racist.  What did you have on?  Oh, we had Vinny the racist.  Yeah.  And just people talking to him.  And was there another guy coming in that wanted to kick his butt or didn't like him, or from the opposing point of view?  Pretty much every listener, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  So listen up.  On three, your eyes are open. 
[03:08:00]  You're going to interlock your arms, and you realize you've been joined at the hit.  You all are Siamese twins, and one of you all are Vinny the racist.  We'll make spaz.  You'll be Vinny the racist, and you'll be Joe the unracist, and your arms are interlocked, and you can't separate.  You've got to live your whole lives together like this.  One, two, three.  Eyes open.  Stand right up.  Interlock those arms.  Interlock those arms right there.  Interlock that right arm right there. 
[03:08:30]  And your name is Vinny.  Yes, I'm Vinny.  Vinny, what is your moniker?  What do they call you, Vinny?  It's a problem.  Lucky.  Well, don't push it over there.  We need to articulate.  What's going on here, Joe?  I don't know.  He's got a problem for them black.  Yeah.  Is that Vinny?  Well, come on.  You're talking to the mic.  All right.  All right.  They're like fighting.  They're Siamese twins.  Oh, my God.  It's been nice visiting you all. 
[03:09:00]  Wow.  Starting at a rough time with that one.  Wow.  They were Siamese twins.  Slick with everything else.  Spaz was a racist, and the other guy was a black guy.  And they weren't connected at the F.  Oh, my God.  Spaz using the F word.  The F, the whatever.  They were using every alphabet.  All right.  Sorry.  Wow.  Well, Gary Conrad.  I got to leave, guys.  I got to show them rascals now.  I hope you guys can do something with them, because I don't know what to do with them.  Gary Conrad. 
[03:09:30]  I'm very impressed.  He's going to be at Rascals all weekend long.  Yeah.  That phone number for Ticket Info, Gary?  Tonight, 973-736-2726.  And we'll be on the World Wide Web, if you check that out on Rascals.  Yeah.  We got the website address.  We'll give it out after commercials, okay?  Cool.  Well, Gary Conrad, it's always a pleasure.  Yeah.  Great, great show.  You'll have a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  He's going to be doing a couple of erotic shows as well this weekend, so call Rascals 
[03:10:00]  for Ticket Info, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  There he goes, everyone.  Gary Conrad.  1027-WNEW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Got to thank Gary Conrad for stopping by once again today.  A lot of fun to check out.  He sure gets that spaz moving, doesn't he?  Yes, he does.  He's running around like a friggin' lunatic.  He loves the spaz. 
[03:10:30]  You see me, I was like a rooster.  I like a chicken with my factory toy car.  Unbelievable.  Steve's got some good footage for the unofficial O.P. and Anthony website.  Oh, yeah.  To fill in the gaps, we were trying to explain it as much as possible there.  www.boundarymusic.com.  It'll take a day or two to get up there, but it'll be there.  Yeah, I'll probably make the clips tomorrow and put them up tomorrow night because during  the day it's hard because the site gets pounded so much.  I know. 
[03:11:00]  Pounded.  You guys are pounding the unofficial website like crazy.  Right after the show, people want to see the site.  They come pounding and pounding and pounding.  And the Super Bowl clips are up.  People are enjoying those from the Super Bowl party, so.  Wow, what a day, what a day, what a day.  Spaz's horrible hype, it's screaming and hollering.  Like a doll's eyes.  A lot of fun. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  It was weird when he came out of it, he's, you know, what is that doll doing here?  Why is my shirt off?  What's your doll doing here?  No.  Did you make me do some of the dolls, did you?  What did Anthony do?  What did Anthony do?  How do you know?  You're not hypnotized.  You didn't go under, huh?  Oh, really?  All right.  What do you want to do?  Do you want to do, what did we learn on the show today?  Well, we have a few calls up there, don't we? 
[03:12:00]  Yes, we do.  212-757-1027.  The fax line, 212-957-9639.  And you can quickly do it on the instant feedback.  We'll try to read as many as possible here, all right?  Aight.  Aight.  People are asking about Gary Conrad.  He'll be at Rascals all weekend long.  Give them a call for ticket info.  There you go.  Let's get this going.  Hey, Peter, what's going on?  Hey, hey.  This is Kevin's brother.  Okay.  Yeah, today I learned that I am now an uncle.  I learned that my brother is a chicken. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  And that I must hide my rubber doll next time he goes to visit.  Very good.  Thank you, Peter.  No problem.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Sounds too smart to be Spaz's brother.  Jimmy, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  You got the brain.  Now, I can honestly say you are the best team on NEW's team.  You are the only team.  I just want to tell you guys Spaz is like sick.  There's something wrong with that guy.  Yeah.  You guys just keep chomping every day, man.  I don't know what to do. 
[03:13:00]  Laugh and laugh and I can't drive no more.  I keep crashing.  Well, that isn't quite a bit of a lesson, is it, Opie?  I know.  What did we learn, bro?  I learned you guys are the best.  I want to guys take care.  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Bye.  Put the radio on.  Put the radio on.  Did you hear that?  Put the radio on.  Put the radio on.  I hear it.  Dutch, what's going on?  All right.  What's going on, guys?  All right.  Hey, I've actually learned two things.  Yeah.  The first thing I learned is if I ever had a kid named Keith, I'm getting a deadbolt from  my bedroom.  That kid was hilarious today. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, he's out of his mind.  Yeah.  Boy to God.  Very good.  The second thing I learned, you know how you guys are talking about driving through Harlem  and whatnot and you just run lights and everything?  I was down in Orlando this past weekend on business, and maybe this is a travel tip for  everyone else out there.  Anytime you find yourself on a street called MLK Boulevard in a strange city, drive faster.  Because they don't put Martin Luther King Boulevards in nice neighborhoods.  Thank you, Christopher Rock.  I pulled up.  I pulled up, and I stopped at the first light of Cainton. 
[03:14:00]  And these guys swarmed out of my car like a bunch of flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz.  Oh, my God.  Come on, dude.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  What a doodle.  It was better when Chris Rock was doing the bit.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  Bye, man.  Bye.  Maggie, you're next on the radio show.  What did you learn today?  Maggie.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Great show, guys.  I'm cracking up.  I learned today that if I ever work for you, I am never going to have sex on any of your  furniture.  You guys are merciless. 
[03:14:30]  I mean, you've punished this boy to the point of damage.  Why not?  He's only going to be able to get that chick from this point on.  Yeah, we rode that pony a little too long, that whole couch thing.  I mean, he's damaged.  The whole Terrence story?  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't touch him with a 10-foot pole.  Well, you've got to see the video now.  I know.  I'm sitting there going two days.  Oh, my God.  No one, Steve.  It'll be up starting tomorrow sometime.  Okay, I've got to check that out because I was just, oh, my God.  Cool.  Thank you, Maggie.  All right.  Bye.  www.foundrymusic.com. 
[03:15:00]  Let's move on to Kuz.  Kuz.  Yo.  You call us all the time now.  I recognize the name.  What's going on?  What's going on, ONA?  Yo, I learned on the show to trust Anthony Moore.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that little, uh, the hypnotist, I mean, it was funny, but I don't buy it.  I won't say that it isn't entertaining as all hell.  Oh, yeah, it's funny as hell, but I don't buy it.  And, like, I can see if you go to a club and stuff and he gets a bunch of people up there  and they're doing things like Spazzle's doing today, you'd be roaring, man.  Go to Rascal, see the guy you left your ass off. 
[03:15:30]  But as far as them being under some kind of a trance, under hypnotism, I'm sorry.  I don't buy it.  I'm buying it.  No, it's just the kick of being in front of everybody, making an ass out of yourself.  Yeah.  That's it.  I don't know.  I don't buy it.  I don't know, guys.  I'm buying that something was going on there.  Thank you, Coos.  All right, syndication now.  Hey, I like that.  Josh from Manhattan on the SM Feedback.  Today I learned that a 12-year-old boy can be more entertaining than any W's morning show.  Keith doing mornings.  That'd be great.  I think if we get Keith and his family and, uh, Vinny the racist, would you listen to a show 
[03:16:00]  where it's just a 12-year-old kid and bringing his friends in and they just talk about, like,  12-year-old kid stuff?  You would have to.  I'd tune in every day.  You would have to tune in.  That would be the funniest damn show.  You would have to.  Talking about, like, the, you know, oh, no, that guy's a dick.  Right.  Talking about, like, girls and stuff and how school sucks.  Right.  You'd laugh your ass off.  Wait, Ed, that's our show.  Yeah, wait a minute.  We get it.  I smell my finger. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, we're in our 30s, but we stopped growing when we hit 15, I think.  Well, wait a minute.  You're right.  It is the show.  Pretty much.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say that I had an appointment to go quit smoking through hypnotism this week.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, forget about it.  I don't know what that guy's going to make me dance like a little freak, like, smoking or something.  I'm not going.  You're scared of hypnotism now?  I got to go find another way.  Okay.  Later, guys. 
[03:17:00]  You guys suck.  Thank you.  John, you're next.  Hey, what's going on?  Not much.  I learned that I would never want to be that rubber chicken.  Yeah.  I mean, when you guys did the spaz, I was dying.  Well, one thing.  I almost ran off the road with the jump shots and the diaper and everything.  One good thing, I think we got a brand new spaz scream that we have to isolate and put off this machine.  You guys get better and better every single day.  I've been listening to you for like three months now, and it's just awesome.  Hey, thank you, John. 
[03:17:30]  Just keep it up.  Thank you.  Syndication now.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  Vito.  Yo, ONA.  How are you?  All right.  This is Vito.  I'm Joe Soprano's brother.  The guy that does some of the founding music.  Hey, listen.  What I learned today was never to listen to your show while walking on ice with the headphones on.  I slipped and busted my ass when I heard Spaz hit the floor doing the pregnancy stuff.  Yeah.  I almost stopped traffic.  You know what?  It had been worth a trip to the hospital because that stuff was hysterical. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, cool.  I've been listening to you guys for like the last couple of weeks now.  My brother started letting me listen to you.  That was it?  Two weeks?  Well, I haven't really.  I mean, I heard of you guys, but I'm working, but I can't really listen.  All right.  But I had the thing on.  You guys almost got me fired.  One of the guys was doing the nigga jokes.  Oh, my God.  I had it kind of like lowered.  All right.  How the hell is going on with that word today on this show?  Popping up a little too often today.  We apologize to our African brother.  Don't worry about them.  All right.  Hey, you guys rock, bro. 
[03:18:30]  Thank you, Vito.  Talk to you later.  John from Peekskill.  I was talking about the word was.  You seem to be using it a lot today.  John from Peekskill.  I learned that Spaz will make a great mom when he grows up.  Got to be bit of the week.  We encourage you guys to check out the video at www.foundrymusic.com.  Okay.  It'll be up hopefully within the next 24 hours.  Yep.  Where are we going?  Jim?  Jim, you're next on the radio show.  What did you learn today?  Oh, well, you know what?  I learned something I didn't want to know.  Spaz's secret fetish is to have sex on, in, and around, and with. 
[03:19:00]  Time to do it.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, your phone petered out right at the money shot.  Something about having sex with inanimate objects.  Yes.  Okay, let's go to Russ.  Russ, you're next on the radio show.  What did you learn today?  Hey, Russ?  Yeah.  What did you learn today?  I learned in celebration of Groundhog's Day, every day is Groundhog's Day for Al Roker,  because there's not a day in the week that brother doesn't see his shadow.  There you go.  Get off the past stuff. 
[03:19:30]  Get on Groundhog's.  Al Roker will see his shadow.  So, I can stand next to him and not get a tan.  All right.  Very good.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what did you learn on the show today?  That hit the test.  What's his name?  Paul McKenna?  No.  Wasn't that Paul McKenna?  Like from Howard?  Yeah, go ahead, Tony.  Congratulations on the 2.9, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you, Tony.  2.9.  Anything else, Tony?  You got to be kidding.  I'll see you.  Hey, Tony, you're listening. 
[03:20:00]  How good you doing?  You're listening.  You're listening, right, Tony?  Nice, right.  Okay.  2.9.  That's right.  2.9.  Deep laughing.  2.9.  See, we could have dumped out of that.  Yeah.  2.9.  That's fine.  Thank you.  He's listening, though, right?  Yeah.  Hey, Jack, you're next on the radio show.  What's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  I learned one of the reasons Anthony got new clothes is because his old pants were stinking  up the joints.  Wow.  Yeah, it got mad at me. 
[03:20:30]  I was joking about that.  Yeah, and is Spaz available for children's parties?  He probably would make a lot of money doing that.  Running around Chuck E. Cheese.  Doing wacky stuff.  Anybody tells him?  Spaz's Playhouse.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  Oh, that bastard gets us every day.  I love that guy.  And I'm trying to listen for his voice now, so he can't do it anymore.  He gets us every time and time.  Oh, it's funny because he didn't use Wrangler today.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Opie's old CV handling.  When I was 12.  This is Dragolo.  He gets to it every day.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  Shut up, you asses.  That's good.  Gerard.  Yes.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Good.  I learned that Anthony is good at scaling houses and breaking into windows.  And I also learned that Keith's mom and dad should put a deadbolt on their door.  Yeah.  Yes.  I think that's the biggest lesson of the day.  Yeah, that kid breaks into the house a little too much. 
[03:21:30]  I mean, to the room a little too much.  Thank you, Gerard.  Thank you.  On that note, Joey from Jersey.  I learned if I go to the Goodwill in Long Island, I could dress like a DJ.  Absolutely.  Look out for my clothes.  I wonder what my fur coat is.  Brian E. from Manhattan.  I learned that you can change a diaper on a rubber chicken.  All right.  All right.  One last one and we'll get out of here.  John, I think you're about it for today.  What's up?  Hey, what I learned is to do any hole that's open.  Thanks.  There you go.  It's all need to be said.  That was the line of the day. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  Thank you, John.  You guys are great.  Okay.  Bye.  With that, I guess we've got to wrap it up, Brian.  Yeah.  Oof.  Wow.  Well, Cowbell Bill, thanks for stopping by.  Cowboy Bill.  Once again.  Thank you, guys.  Cowboy Bill.  Yeah, Cowboy Bill.  There you go.  He doesn't want to start that.  Poor guy.  Every time.  Do people not hear Cowbell?  Yeah, I know.  Cowbell.  Cowbell Bill.  And they're all like, hey, Cowboy Bill.  No, Cowboy Bill.  What is he?  Is he on a hat?  Yeah, that's like the Openie and Andy show. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I want to talk about the Openie and Andy.  Ebony.  Ebony.  Cowbell Bill.  Cowboy Bill.  Boy.  All right.  Cowboy.  Always a pleasure when you stop in, Bill.  Thanks, guys.  Well, I guess it's time to power down.  This ends the broadcast day here at WNEW.  Oh, that's right.  Saving a little energy.  We've got to power down.  Just shut that switch.  And pull the lever.  There we go.  Shutting her down. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, look how dim everything is.  Shutting her down.  No reason to keep the station transmitter working after we can leave the airwaves.  That's for sure.  Shutting down.  Up next, Kane.  The only problem is you've got to turn your dial, though.  Don't even know the guy, but we're going to start promoting him.  You're a great rock and roll.  That's right.  Some great rock from 92.3 K-Rock on the way with Kane. 
[03:23:30]  It's our show, but you've just got to change the station.  Continuation.  It's what we listen to on the way home.  You might as well, too.  Trust me.  Nothing to see here.  Move along, people.  Move along.  Move along.  Nothing to see here.  Please turn the dial to 92.3 on your FM dial.  Completely serious.  Oh, my God.  What?  I don't think I've ever heard that. 
[03:24:00]  We gave the guy a chance, and he sucks.  He can't keep our audience, so we might as well give our audience to someone else and see what they can do with it.  We learned today, Jim from Huntington, we learned today that Anthony runs behind the equipment way too much.  Yeah, I've been a lot lately.  I really, I found a nice niche back there to get away from people.  All right, stay tuned for Kane, 92.3 K-Rock.  Tell him we said hi.  We're giving him our whole audience from now on.  Until something better comes along at 7 o'clock. 
[03:24:30]  Until we get something we could, you know, promote.  Yeah.  That's what we're doing from now on, okay?  Might as well promote something else within the company.  Oh, we need the lineup promo.  Right here.  No, no, no.  We need that lineup promo.  Notice who's missing.  Notice who's not on our website anymore.  Kane next, 92.3 K-Rock. </pre>
