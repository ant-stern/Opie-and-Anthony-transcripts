<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The March 10th, 2000, Opie and Anthony Show was a chaotic blend of planned segments and unplanned mayhem.  The broadcast opened with a discussion of the "Most Offensive Song Ever Written" contest, highlighting listener submissions like "Baby Raper" and "Kill a Fetus,"  which sparked significant controversy among listeners and management.  The hosts announced a live roadshow in April where the top entries would be performed live.  A Mountain Dew Final Four promotion was also interwoven throughout.

A major subplot involved the ongoing, disastrous attempts by staff members Spaz and Stinky to fill a kiddie pool with warm water for a planned "Smelly Karen" sponge bath.  This segment, along with the offensive song contest, dominated much of the show, punctuated by numerous listener calls, many containing "F.U." messages and vulgar commentary on both the songs and Spaz and Stinky's comical incompetence.  Stephen Lynch's "Kill a Kitten" was mentioned as another source of listener complaints.  Anthony briefly discussed his previous night's appearance on another show, and a Stacker 2 commercial aired.  The "FU Friday" segment allowed listeners to air grievances, further fueling the already volatile atmosphere.  The "Bit of the Week" contest featured entries including "Kill a Fetus" and a Jamaican diarrhea bit, sparking further discussion about the offensiveness of "Baby Raper."  One caller even recounted a story about infidelity.  The hosts also discussed their personal finances, with one revealing a lucrative past on Wall Street.

The planned "Smelly Karen" segment, involving a listener encouraged not to shower, took a dramatic turn.  Spaz's failure to secure participants for the sponge bath led to his sudden disappearance from the studio, triggering a frantic search involving calls to listeners and a comedic, Tom Brokaw-style parody police bulletin.  Unconfirmed reports of Spaz taking a hostage circulated amidst the search.  Despite Spaz's absence, the "Smelly Karen" segment proceeded, albeit unexpectedly.  Smelly Karen was eventually joined in the kiddie pool by two strippers from Privilege, Stella and Nikita, resulting in a prolonged, sexually explicit scene involving soaping, washing, and mutual touching.  The hosts and callers provided a running, often crude and offensive commentary throughout.  The song "Baby Raper" by Jeff (a.k.a. Fuel) was played, fitting into the ongoing offensive song contest.  The show also featured a mention of Louis C.K.'s previous appearance.

The later part of the show included Dice's return from vacation.  The "Bit of the Week" featured a humorous segment about a lesbian bath, with plans to bottle and distribute the bathwater at the upcoming roadshow.  The "What Did We Learned" segment focused heavily on listener reactions to a webcam feed showing naked women in the pool, using highly explicit language.  Spaz's absence continued to be a running joke, with a fake "Spaz" calling in.  Callers also discussed their reactions to the child rape song, and one caller detailed marital problems.  Listener Billy suggested "Trey Gash" as a name for the bottled bathwater.  Steve from the unofficial O&A website was in the studio documenting the event.  The show concluded with plugs for Anthony's limousine service, an upcoming Louis Black show, and a song summarizing the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony, stupid.  We had guys lifting stuff with their units.  Probe tests.  Excuse me, taking a big boot.  It's just...  Scotty, you've got to get our protective membrane vaginal seal back up.  I thought I'd no fancy son.  Hey, that is the rest of the world.  It's insane.  We had guys come in that enjoy getting kicked in the nads.  Big parents.  You really don't know where the trampoline goes, right? 
[00:00:30]  Ivory has reloaded.  Yeah, that one just over eight feet.  Opie and Anthony.  Dopey ass show.  W-N-E-W.  Hello, Anthony.  Hey, hey.  It's FU Friday.  We made it to the end of another week of broadcasting, Anthony.  Where's our goddamn coffee?  Yeah, what happened to our coffee?  We need coffee.  We do the coffee thing now before the show. 
[00:01:00]  It eats coffee.  Hit me up.  It eats coffee.  Where's the coffee?  Please.  Thank you, please.  Yeah.  Are we sending Stinky to get coffee or what?  Go ahead, Stinky.  We've got to put Stinky on the spaz cam today.  Why?  Because he's goofy.  Because he's goofy.  What, Ben?  You might as well say it on the air. 
[00:01:30]  What?  Space bar.  It's space bar?  Yeah, it's FU Friday, Anthony.  Yeah.  Of course, if something pissed you off this week and you want to tell a couple million people,  you give us a call.  212-757-1027, right?  Feel free.  Or you could send a fax.  If you're going to send a fax, make it short and to the point, because we get probably like  a thousand faxes by the end of the show.  Right.  We're not going to read the long, drawn-out ones, all right?  Make it short and quick, and we'll try to read that on the air as well. 
[00:02:00]  212-957-9639 is the fax line.  Right.  Also, a lot of controversy over the Most Offensive Song Contest.  Oh, Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Oh, boy.  People just going crazy.  Yeah.  I mean, people angered by this contest.  And it is the Most Offensive Song Ever Written contest.  So, of course, people are going to call in and e-mail because it's offensive, the most offensive. 
[00:02:30]  And yesterday, I think when we played with the song that is in the lead right now, which  is Baby Raper.  Baby Raper.  You know, go figure.  Someone would get all pissed off at a song with the title Baby Raper.  Well, you know, this is the People's Radio Show.  We did ask you guys if we should go forward with this contest, and you guys said you have  to go forward with this contest.  Did you, at some point, start humming that last night?  In the middle of the night.  In the middle of the night, I had to take a leak. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  So, the outrage is incredible.  Yeah.  The boss was on the phone half the morning, he said.  Yeah.  Very angry.  We tried to explain that this contest would get really ugly.  It's only going to get uglier, by the way.  Yeah.  I mean, the songs are starting to pour in now.  That just set the bar at where you have to be.  And I must say, we had, what, Rick, about ten entries today? 
[00:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  About ten entries today?  Mm-hmm.  None of them will be played on our radio show today.  Why is that?  Because they don't come close to Baby Raper.  Uh-huh.  We would disappoint you guys if we played the entries that came in today.  Mm-hmm.  They don't come close.  And a lot of people voting for the fetus song, too.  Kill a fetus.  Coming back, uh...  Coming back strong.  After people had a day to mull it over.  Coming back strong in the email, Anthony.  People thinking it over.  We've decided that we're going to have a road show, and we're going to get, like, you know, 
[00:04:00]  the top four or five most offensive songs, and have those people play them live in front  of, like, 1,500 of our listeners.  They'd love that.  And then we'll have the listeners decide who wrote the most offensive song.  Right.  So, as we speak, we're trying to get a road show together for early April.  Yeah.  A couple weeks into April, maybe mid-April.  Sure.  So that you still have time to get your song in for the contest. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Jesus, man.  Well, the phones are just going BS right now.  So let's take a quick break, Anthony.  All right.  And we'll be back.  We'll go right to the phones next and see what you guys are talking about today.  Okay?  Cool.  212-757-1027.  Lots to do today, by the way.  We're going to play all the offensive songs that we've gotten so far.  We've got Smelly Karen coming in for her sponge bath.  Yeah.  It's F.U. Friday.  And, of course, whatever you guys want to add as well.  All right?  212-757-1027. 
[00:05:00]  So be it, Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fags!  1027-WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Mountain Dew.  Yeah, we've got something going on with Mountain Dew, don't we?  Yes, we do.

[00:06:00]  Go to www.wnew.com.  WNEW, New York, Infinity Broadcasting.  Opie and Anthony.  How often do you get to listen to somebody's cell phone to somebody's uterus?  More stupidity is on the way.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  One of the many things we're doing on the show today is featuring all the offensive songs that we have received.  Of course, Stephen Lynch.  Yes. 
[00:06:30]  I don't know.  I think we have about five or six from him alone, Anthony.  Very offensive.  But if we're going to be playing offensive songs today that we have received, we've got to play Stephen Lynch's Priest song.  That one's very offensive.  And, of course, we've got to play the one that started it all in a little while, the FBA.  Full Blown Aids.  Full Blown Aids.  That was the inspiration for our contest, most offensive song ever written.  Yeah.  Very bad.  So as the show goes on, we'll play all of them.  Sure. 
[00:07:00]  Okay.  Maybe even one more play of the Barry Manilow most offensive song.  That one's good just for the fact that the guy can't sing.  Yeah.  His voice is offensive.  And we'll play that one next, matter of fact.  All right.  Let's go to the phones and see what everyone is talking about.  We'll go to Antonio.  Antonio.  Anthony.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello.  Anthony.  Oh.  Hello.  Every day it's something different with the phones. 
[00:07:30]  Hmm.  Are you there, Anthony?  Okay.  Now I can't hang up.  Uh-oh.  It'll be one of those days, isn't it?  Kevin.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, Kevin?  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  Good.  That last song was great.  The kitten song?  Yeah.  That's the first time you heard that?  Yes, I did.  Let me tell you something about the kitten song from Stephen Lynch.  You know that we get more complaints after we play Kill a Kitten than we did after we 
[00:08:00]  played Kill a Fetus?  Oh, yeah.  Swear to you.  We played Kill a Fetus yesterday by Billy and Paul from airsick.net.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard that.  We didn't get that many complaint calls today.  But when we played that Kill a Kitten song, oh, my God, the animal rights activist out of  the woodwork.  Yeah, I don't know.  I feel there's no use of the cats on this earth.  Oh, Jesus.  I just hate cats.  All right.  Well, thank you, Kevin.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Take care.  Let's go to Maria.  Maria, you're next on NEW.  How are you today?  Oh, doing good. 
[00:08:30]  Doing good.  Yeah.  I really love that song.  But I must say that the abortion song kind of beat this one.  Well, yeah, we know that.  It's between, at this point, the Kill a Fetus song and Baby Raper.  And Baby Raper is the most offensive song.  Yeah.  Well, we're just going to feature all the offensive songs today on the show.  Yeah.  Can I give an F you to my brother, Oren, in the Bronx?  It's his birthday today, and he just took the day off.  All right.  Well, you just did.  Oh, great.  Cool.  All right.  Hey, you guys are the best, man.  I have actually stopped listening to Howard Stern completely. 
[00:09:00]  I mean, I'm listening to you guys every single day.  You could listen to him in the morning.  Yeah, we're not really going to listen to us in the afternoon.  No, no.  I mean, he's like...  We're not competing with him.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm not saying that you guys are.  I mean, he's like old news, and you guys are definitely the new news.  Ah.  You guys should definitely overrule Howard Stern, no matter what, because you guys are the best.  All right, Maria.  Thank you very much.  Take care.  Now, because of that phone call, we'll get a call from corporate. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that hurt.  Mike, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  Good.  We're talking to you, man.  I got an FU to the entire program you guys are running.  Why?  I was at work today.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  I work in hospitals.  I'm in an OVAR, right?  I'm in an operating room, and a baby raper pops into my head, but I can't remember the  tune, so I start singing, I'm a baby raper.  The keggers.  Oh, you did it to keggers?  Yeah, I couldn't remember the tune.  I'm a baby raper. 
[00:10:00]  We deliver keggers.  Can you believe that, guys?  I'm a baby raper.  Kind of catchy, huh?  Wow.  Very catchy.  That's a little scary.  Hey, what happened?  Are you guys moving the mornings or not?  Oh, we're not going to be doing that.  Good.  I hope not.  We are staying right where we are.  I like my schedule for now.  I love it, too.  My schedule rocks.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  Sleep, sleep, sleep.  Wake up.  Do nothing. 
[00:10:30]  Do show.  Stay up late.  Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.  Hey, Linda, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hi, what's up?  Well, listen, I have an idea.  Yeah.  The contest?  Yeah.  I think the Barry Manilow song, I think that should be like the theme song for the whole  contest.  The most offensive song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that one was good, and that was the first entry we played on the air, but the songs  have gotten drastically better since then.  Right.  I agree.  Those entries are like the theme song, and you'll play that whenever you're talking about the  contest.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to play the most offensive song one last time before we put it to rest, 
[00:11:00]  so.  I don't think there's anything offensive about the Killer Kitten song.  Well, no.  I mean, that's not even in the running.  I just, we just want to play all the-  Yeah, don't get confused, people.  We just want to play all the offensive songs.  Right, but Killing Kitten should be what we should be doing.  Oh, Linda, come on now.  I once did, right in my driveway.  All right.  Thank you, Linda.  Bye, guys.  You're a sick F.  Jimmy, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on?  Oh, hey.  How are you?  What is that?  What is that?  What is that?  What's going on?  Listen, man, I'm so disappointed. 
[00:11:30]  Why?  I had an abortion song all set up.  I was three-quarters of the way done with it, and this guy comes out with Baby Raper.  Well, Baby Raper is going to be tough to beat.  You might want to work on another subject at this point.  Yeah, listen to me.  Listen, I just want your guys' opinion, all right?  Yeah.  Let me give you two lyrics to the song, and you tell me if it's bad or not, if it's good  or not.  All right.  And I'm going to keep going with it, all right?  Any curses in the song?  No, no, no.  All right, let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  All right, listen.  And I'm not going to sing it, I'm just going to give you one verse of the song, and you 
[00:12:00]  let me know if it's sick enough or not.  All right.  All right, let's go.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  You rape them, we scrape them.  No fetus can beat us.  That old gag.  Sounds like a commercial.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, work on it and send it in.  You never know.  All right.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  Let's go to Ken.  Ken, you're next on NAW.  Oh, and hey, you guys rock.  I listen to you every day.  Thank you, Ken.  Just call it in to say that Baby Raper's definitely it, but I love to kill a kitten, and I'm a 
[00:12:30]  cat lover, so go figure.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you're not really doing it.  You can enjoy a funny song.  Oh, man.  You know what we're going to have to do?  We're going to have a road show, and we're going to bring all the finalists there, and  it's just going to be a great road show, because we'll have these people performing their  songs live on the stage in front of at least 1,400 people.  Yeah.  Awesome.  You guys got to come back out to Long Island, but come to a bigger place than Mulcahy's.  Well, we were just on the island, so it could be a while.  What we're thinking, we were talking about this in the office before the show today. 
[00:13:00]  We're thinking Westchester.  We're thinking the White Plains area, get some of our Connecticut listeners, you know?  We haven't been north yet, so if we can find a place that's going to be cool to us  and our listeners, we just might make it up there.  Good deal.  If any club owners up there are interested, you've got to get a hold of Ben.  Ben Sparks.  All right?  Thank you.  ONA, just one last question.  Did you ever talk to a radio chick about the Mod Squad deal? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, she's been talking about that the last few days.  Oh, no.  They've been going with it.  It's been pretty cool.  Okay.  All right, man.  Cool, ONA.  Long time listener, first time caller.  You guys are awesome.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny, you're next on N.E.W.  ONA, what's up?  How are you?  You guys are the best.  I've been listening to you since you guys got on the radio.  Since you've been here in New York, you guys are the new afternoon.  I started listening to the radio chick.  Oh, cool. 
[00:14:00]  My new station, 1027.  Wow.  That's the first time we've heard that in about a year.  It used to be, you know, Opie and Anthony, the only show I listened to on N.E.W.,  but now he's saying, you know, my station, N.E.W.  I know.  I listen to everything.  I didn't listen in the morning because the mornings pretty much suck.  Well, stay tuned.  I tune in early in the afternoon to catch a radio chick,  and she and Butchie had me laughing all day.  Cool.  And then right into you guys for the night.  All right, cool.  I got to start off with, though, I got an F you to my friend, Steve. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  He last night decided to call my girlfriend and call her a slut, which was three months  up.  And he was just playing around with her, but she took it all personally.  Well, yeah, they tend to do that.  She got all bent out of shape, and I had to listen to her bitch at me for, like, a long  time.  All right.  And then so I got that for him.  And I got a question.  Can you play the song that you guys played yesterday about the Baby Raper and that one,  and then the one from the other day for the Barry Manilow song? 
[00:15:00]  All right.  We're going to do that, Danny.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Syndication now.  I was like pulling teeth, Danny.  So close to Christopher Reeve falling on you.  Yeah.  I heard it coming, man.  Yeah.  Believe me.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Go get a cup of coffee so you're on the same level as us, all right?  All right.  Cool.  My finger was right on the button.  We're all jonesing.  Wow.  Everyone wants to talk about Anthony's appearance on the new night show.  All right.  Rock, what's up?  What's doing, guys?  How are you?  I heard you last night, Ant.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you popped in to give him a little hand there. 
[00:15:30]  That was fun, huh?  Want some support?  Sure.  Make fun of that fuzzy voice there.  I think those guys are wandering the halls today.  Where are they?  We should have them come in.  Yeah, you should.  Say hi to the afternoon audience.  They're pretty good.  And Ant was pretty good on their show last night?  Well, he could have been a little funnier, but he was mellow.  I hate when you guys do that to us, because there are times, like, we'll jump on another  show and we'll have a guest on their show.  I'm not going to start being my own character, Anthony. 
[00:16:00]  What am I supposed to do?  It's hard.  Take over?  I was hoping you were going to break into the Ed Wynn voice.  It's hard enough to be funny every day between 2 and 7.  When we go on the other shows, we're just kind of hanging.  We get a long day by the time we get on the other shows.  I was really intoxicated, too.  Yeah, I figured you weren't headed home.  How was the cocktail last night?  It was 12 o'clock at night, and I'm on the air.  I'm usually drunk.  All right, Rock.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Rock on, man. 
[00:16:30]  All right, bye.  How's the flight simulator game going?  Oh, my God.  You're crazy, man.  I'm trying this, the Jane's F-A-18.  You know, I've got it all booted up, and I'm thumbing through the manual, which is like  a dictionary.  And then I'm trying to lock onto the ship, so I finally figured it out.  But it's a pain in the air, so I swear to God, if I figure this out, I can fly one of 
[00:17:00]  these things.  That's how technical it is.  It's alphabet soup, all acronyms for everything.  I'm like, what is that?  What the hell is that?  How do I acquire a target?  Just a manual.  I'm freaking out.  Just a manual for this game is like, I don't know why you do it to yourself.  You guys are trying to figure it out.  I figured out how to launch the harpoons, harpoon missiles against the ships.  All right, we're getting somewhere.  So I launch them, and it was really cool.  You know, I blew the ship up.  It was really, like, pretty cool.  But I lock onto something. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know what I'm locked onto.  Could be one of ours.  I don't care.  I just launch it.  Anyway, I want to see something blow up.  But, you know, in order to really play the game, you've got to be able to figure that  stuff out.  You can't be knocking your own ships out of the water.  So, I don't know.  It's going to take a while to figure this one out.  I'm kind of, I don't know, very confused on this one.  Yeah.  It's one of those games that are just, like, impossible to learn.  The learning curve.  You don't even know where to begin.  Yeah.  It just drove me nuts watching you guys trying to figure this out. 
[00:18:00]  And how much beer was consumed here last night after I left?  Wow, last night.  Paul, I got in early today, and it was like, I felt like I was back in the fraternity house.  They're, like, you know, just taking out the bottles from our office, bag after bag.  Let me tell you something.  We only had some beer being consumed in that office last night.  How many people we had here last night?  Maybe six people in our office?  There were so many beer bottles.  How, do we have any beer left?  Yeah, we can have a case.  Oh, cool.  We can have a case.  Is it being chilled as we speak? 
[00:18:30]  No, but thank you for reminding me.  Yeah, let's Stinky load up the fridge for later on.  And there he goes, running down the hall.  Stinky, load up the fridge.  Chop, chop, chop, chop.  I want them cleaned and popped with a fine chamois.  Yeah.  I got in early today.  I'm like, man, there was a party going on here after I left.  Well, Psycho Mark drinking and telling his stories about his life and his childhood and growing up and in Boston. 
[00:19:00]  I was rolling, just laughing my ass off.  And then he's like, I got to get out of here.  Ah, one more.  One more.  I got to get cocked before I leave.  And we were just pounding him last night.  Every two seconds, that fridge was open and it closed.  You should just put a revolving door on that friggin' refrigerator.  I left just when it was getting interesting.  And, man, I was convinced Old Dirty was going to punch you in the face, Psycho Mark.  Old Dirty getting angry.  I tell you, the language that flies when there's a few beers back there in that office and we're all sitting around joking. 
[00:19:30]  No one's safe.  Unbelievable, the racist rhetoric you hear coming out of everyone's mouth.  White, black, it doesn't matter who's saying it.  I was going to say, it doesn't matter what color you are.  I mean, everyone got it.  Oh, so.  Unbelievable.  All I heard, I don't know who said it, but, what was it, get me, just shut up and get me another beer, you big-lipped bastard.  That's all I heard.  I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:20:00]  What are you, nuts?  Well, then you're going to shut your ass, you crack your ass.  Oh, yeah.  Kick your white ass.  You know, there's a race riot going on back then.  Yeah.  Well, it looked like you guys had a good time.  Hey, bring the pool in here real fast before they put the water in it.  Let's see this thing.  We have Smelly Karen coming down at around 4.30 today.  Smelly Karen.  And, uh, she's going to get sponged down by some really, really hot girls.  We're going to show her how it's done to, how it's done to, you know, keep clean. 
[00:20:30]  And look at this pool, Anthony.  Yeah, that's a good pool.  That's a nice-sized kiddie pool.  It's a super box.  That's got to be about a foot and a half deep, I guess.  A foot and a half deep.  And that's at least six to seven feet across, wouldn't you say?  Two feet deep, six or seven feet across.  Yeah, that's a big one.  Because we're going to have at least four or five girls in there.  How are we filling this up?  Yeah, how are we filling this up?  Oh.  Going to take a leak in it.  I just blew it.  I thought someone else has to worry about the water.  Did we get a tarp?  Do we have any type of hose that can hook up to a sink that people fill their water beds with or something? 
[00:21:00]  Do we have, what do we have, a bucket?  Are we doing the bucket route?  Did anyone think of this?  If we're doing the bucket route, you guys better get to it.  You better start now because we only have an hour before everyone arrives.  Make it warm and stuff.  Make it warm and really soapy.  On the hot side of warm.  Make it very hot because by the time 4.30 hits, it'll cool up.  Exactly.  All right.  Wow.  Lots of stuff today, Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  Let's play another one of the offensive songs, okay?  Mm-hmm.  This was the first entry that we played on the air.  And it's a loser at this point.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, I think his name was Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  He even called and said, look, it's over.  I know it.  He conceded defeat.  He conceded defeat to kill a fetus.  But it's pretty bad.  The singing is really great.  The middle of the song, Applause Break.  Yeah.  It's like Barry Manilow used to have.  All right.  One more time before we bury this one. 
[00:22:00]  And it's called The Most Offensive Song on WNEW.  I've done my share of cocaine.  You kids should give it a try.  I've brought some Korean store clerks back from churches, 
[00:22:30]  burned-down playgrounds, and hospitals.  The most offensive song you've ever heard.  Rocker was right when he said, 
[00:23:00]  Things that we think, but don't stay.  Oh, I've put it on him in one song. 
[00:23:30]  You listen and deny it and say that this is  The most offensive song you've ever heard.  A border fetus in the shell that's a turn.  The last thing that the drowning humans will hear.  The most offensive song you've ever heard.  The most offensive song you've ever heard. 
[00:24:00]  The Italian mafia, giant stadium, Lineshopper.  Barefoot and pregnant, it's all women, all good for.  Statue of liberty, should be armed with an Uzi.  A border fetus in the shell. 
[00:24:30]  The most effective song is you. The most effective song you've ever heard. 
[00:25:00]  The most effective song you've ever heard. This is the last time you've ever heard.  The most effective song you've ever heard. This is the last time you've ever heard.  The most effective song is you.

[00:27:00]  Lots going on on the show today.  Smelly Karen coming in at 4.30 for her sponge bath.  My God, man.  Hot, beautiful girls, naked.  Giving her a sponge bath.  A nice soapy sponge bath, Anthony.  You gotta call her Smelly Karen.  She's gonna get very upset.  Maybe not show up.  Wait till she gets here.  Well, everyone has a name on this show, you know?  You can't just say Karen.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Smelly Karen.  Our listeners know what Smelly Karen is. 
[00:27:30]  Smelly Karen.  I did tell her if, if, if she was nice and clean after the sponge bath that we would drop  the smelly from her name.  That's only fair, right?  Yeah.  So they're filling up the pool outside, but knowing our little radio staff, I'm sure something's  going to go drastically wrong, Anthony.  It's going to explode.  Ben laid a few gallons of water all over the, uh...  Ben's looking out the studio door.  What's going on so far, Ben?  I see, like, Spaz and Stinky.  See, you guys don't really know Stinky that well yet, but Stinky is the clone of Spaz. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  We truly believe that at this point.  He runs around like a lunatic, just like his boss, Spaz.  Yeah.  And all I see through the studio door is them just frantically running around the place out  there.  Are they getting anything done, Ben?  We've got the, the pool is ready to go.  We now get the tarp under it.  Now we're just going to fill it.  Now, did no one figure out how we're going to fill this pool?  Well, I guess we're just going to take the bucket and just fill it up from the, uh, J-More  suite.  Uh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll bring mouthfuls of water over and just spit it out of me.  You know what's going on, Anthony? 
[00:28:30]  It's pretty funny.  Like, um, Spaz and Stinky, they're just kind of walking by the kiddie pool trying to figure  it out.  They're like, okay, pool, water.  What?  Uh, how do we do that?  How do we get the water now in the pool?  And they're walking by like they're real busy and they know exactly what's going on.  I mean, you can just tell that there's like just nothing happening in their brains as  they try to figure this out.  There's nothing funny than Spaz trying to give Stinky direction to him.  He's like, okay, you got, you got to do this.  You got, you got to wait.  Okay.  Here, get Spaz and Stinky in here real fast.  Where?  Stinky. 
[00:29:00]  Spaz.  Oh, God.  They look like twins.  I swear, look at them.  They look like brothers.  They even have the same goopy smile.  All right.  Guys, have you figured out how to fill up the kiddie pool?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  And water started going all over the bathroom.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  We have a hose that goes from the faucet to the bucket.  Yeah.  And we turned the water on and it was going through the hose, but a lot of it was coming  out of some pipe underneath the sink. 
[00:29:30]  Some pipe.  Some pipe underneath the sink.  So that's where we stand right now.  We can't figure out how to get the water into the bucket.  And then we're going to take the bucket and put the water into the kiddie pool, right?  Right, Spaz?  I'm thinking just put the, go from the faucet, straight from the faucet to the bucket and  then carry the bucket over to the pool.  Oh, that's, that's, wow.  Look at that.  That's not a bad idea.  A command decision being made.  Are you making an executive decision on this, Spaz?  Yes, but the only problem.  You have decided that we should just take the pail and, and, and fill it up directly from 
[00:30:00]  the faucet, right?  Yes, but there's one problem.  When you fill up the bucket totally and you're trying to get it from underneath the faucet again,  You dump half the water out.  Yes.  So, in the, in, to save time, just fill the bucket up halfway.  Yes.  Because then the time saved, filling it the other half, just have it dumped down the drain  will be, be safe.  Stinky, do you have any thoughts on this to make it go a little slower?  Yeah, any ideas maybe to help out?  Maybe you could, maybe you could upstage your boss, Spaz here. 
[00:30:30]  I don't know, I think Spaz actually had a pretty good idea.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Stinky, yeah?  Look at him kissing the boss's ass.  Yeah.  Oh, the boss.  Give me a break.  All right, so when do you think that the filling of the pool will commence?  We're thinking soon.  Soon.  We're thinking soon.  So, so your schedule says soon.  Soon.  Yeah.  Within a half an hour, I'm thinking.  Within a half, do you realize this girl will be here and, and the pool has to be filled  with warm water, hot water? 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  Okay.  How long do you think it's going to take once you start filling it?  I, I'd say maybe about 20 minutes, but the water will cool down by the time she gets here,  so we're going to have to probably refill a warm water.  Physics with Spaz.  You know, evaporation is a cooling process in which.  And we got to tell our faithful listeners, there's going to come a time when Ant and I have to  step aside and allow the, the youngsters of radio to take over, and, and here they are.  Spaz and Stinky. 
[00:31:30]  That's the only reason they work for our radio show.  They are hoping someday, Anthony, to follow in our footsteps.  Okay, terrific.  All right, great.  All right, well, this is, um, wow, this is quite a job for you two.  There's no hose or anything that can just be taken from the, from the sink. 
[00:32:00]  That's what we just tried.  We just tried.  This is a radio station.  They don't have hoses.  Oh, my God.  All right, well, all right, why don't you guys go figure it out?  There are one, two, three, four, five guys trying to figure out how to get the water.  How to get water into a kiddie pole.  The bathroom is maybe ten feet away.  They have to move water ten feet.  Did you, have, have you ever seen the, uh, the great pyramids?  Oh, yes.  Over in Egypt?  Of course.  Do you know that they pulled stones from God knows where and built pyramids? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Without any technology whatsoever?  Mm-hmm.  Put a little perspective on things.  Well, they didn't have retards built in the thousands of years ago.  Now we're having a dilemma moving water ten feet into a kiddie pool.  Yeah.  And it's a serious dilemma.  They're all running around trying to figure it out.  It's serious.  They're really having a problem figuring out how to fill a frigging kiddie pool up.  Get Steve in here from the unofficial website.  Steve, what the hell's going on out there? 
[00:33:00]  You have more of a brain than both those guys combined.  It's like a meeting at, like, the Corps of Engineers.  Yeah, yeah, the Army Corps of Engineers trying to figure out how to build a bridge.  They've got buckets.  They've got, uh, wastebaskets.  They've got, like, little pieces of plastic latex tubing that you use to hold, like, a lot of electrical cords together.  Yeah.  And there's water everywhere.  You can't.  It's unbelievable.  The place is going to be soaked.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Wonderful.  We just want to get the water in the thing.  How are you going to get it out?  Uh, Paul, that's another thing. 
[00:33:30]  And we don't have a low area for a siphon.  Right.  You're going to have, you know, a couple hundred gallons of water in this thing.  They're going to have to bucket it back into the bathroom.  That's right.  If Stinky gets a little on him, that won't hurt either.  Too funny.  Just a simple little thing we wanted to do for the show, and, uh, I don't know if it's going to happen.  All right, Tony, you're next on WNW.  Tony?  Yeah, I got, how you guys doing?  ONA.  Yeah, what's up?  I got a big F you for spaz and stinking, because if I don't get to hear this today, I'm going to be really pissed off. 
[00:34:00]  No, we'll, we'll, we'll pull it out of our butt somehow.  It's not looking good right now, but Rick feels confident.  I, I hope so.  I, I really got to hear her.  All right.  I mean, I want to come down and watch her.  Well, uh, no, we're going to get some video on the unofficial site.  There you go.  All right.  Hey, indication now.  Thank you, Tony.  Rick, everything under control out there?  Under control.  Holy smoke.  I've taken the two, uh, retards. 
[00:34:30]  Retards.  For lack of a better term.  It's special ed class out there today.  Amazing.  I've taken them upstairs.  I've been to buy that.  I showed them a big dump sink that they can use that has hot water.  Wait, upstairs?  Upstairs.  Holding.  Now they're going to have to bring water from upstairs down the stairs.  That's why we have Steve here with video.  Into the pool.  Through a couple locked doors.  Yeah.  Instead of transferring, uh, the 10 feet from the bathroom we have right next to the kid.  Oh, boy.  I just see disaster. 
[00:35:00]  I know.  I see someone just falling down the stairs and water going everywhere.  I just saw them.  They're carrying big huge buckets of water.  This is how they used to put fires out in the 1800s.  Yeah.  It is.  They have, like, a bucket chain.  One guy is upstairs, and they're just passing the buckets down.  It's down the hallway.  If this building ever goes up in flames.  What?  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, you're next on WNAW.  Oh, hey.  What's going on?  How are you, Mike? 
[00:35:30]  Good.  This can't be real.  Put one of those idiots on the phone.  Seriously.  This is really pissing me off.  It's real.  They can't figure it out.  Now they're getting water from upstairs and bringing it downstairs to fill up.  Can they hear me?  I mean, are they in the room?  Can they hear me?  Uh, no.  No.  This is ridiculous.  You need to freaking hire me to talk to these morons.  Get them on the phone.  I want to talk to them.  Um, if you call back after break, we'll get them in the studio for you, Mike.  Fine.  I'll call you back.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Everyone very pissed off.  Well, they're a couple of idiots. 
[00:36:00]  They are the future of radio, though, Anthony.  Someday we're going to have to step aside, and someone like Spaz and Stinky are going to  have to take our place.  Oh, stop.  No way.  Well, we can't do this forever.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  All right.  Let's go to James.  James, you're next on N.E.W.  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  First time caller.  First time Spaz ever let me get through.  Wank, wank.  Well, because he's too busy trying to fill up the kiddie pool.  Sure, sir. 
[00:36:30]  People just pissed off on the instant feedback.  I can't fill up the kiddie pool.  I can't fill up the kiddie pool.  There are people out there that would kill for Spaz and Stinky's job.  Yeah.  I would.  All right.  I'm listening.  I wonder if you guys can do me a favor.  Sure.  I haven't heard the full-blown AIDS song yet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The song that started the Most Defensive Song Contest.  Right.  Because, I mean, I don't know.  Oh, I listen to the show 2 to 7 every day, but I just miss that.  All right.  Let's play that for you.  All right.  All right.  Can you leave me on hold for it?  Because I'm not in the car right now.  Yeah.  Hold on.  All right.  Great. 
[00:37:00]  I think we can do that, right, Ant?  Sure.  You want to explain the full-blown AIDS song?  Just in case people weren't listening when all that went down?  Well, we had Stephen Lynch in and Jay Moore.  And Mike DiNicola, Mike DiNicola, who's a good guy.  And I don't know how it started.  Mike and Jay Moore started pinning a tune called Full-Blown AIDS.  I think they were pissed off that Stephen didn't have any new songs.  And he goes, well, I'm writing them.  And Jay Moore was like, well, how hard could it be? 
[00:37:30]  I'll write one, Full-Blown AIDS.  So him and Mike wrote Full-Blown AIDS.  And Stephen, after a little bit of prodding, like a half hour of saying, sing the goddamn song, performed it.  So we have a version of Stephen doing the composition by Mike and Jay Moore, Full-Blown AIDS.  And Stephen Lynch did not write this.  He's very paranoid about that.  Make no mistake, this is the only version out there.  There is no other version coming along.  There might be a bootleg somewhere.  And this is the song that started it all, as far as the most offensive song contest, all right? 
[00:38:00]  All right.  So let's play it now, Anthony.  Yes.  We like to refer to it as F-B-A.  Yeah.  All right, this is called, what is this called again?  Authors of the song?  Jay?  Jay, what's this called?  It's called Full-Blown AIDS.  Down to my target weight.  A coma has popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth in all my friends.  Looks like I'm nearing the end. 
[00:38:30]  No use telling a lie, or even a film.  When you're lying in bed, counting all your ribs.  I tried to give blood, but you showed me the door.  When I went to stand up, when I fell on the floor.  It's full-blown AIDS.  Damn that whore. 
[00:39:00]  Damn that whore.  I said, damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  All right, that was a shame to be ashamed of yourself, man.  I can't believe you would play a song like that.  That's probably the most offensive thing I've ever heard in my life.  Jay and Mike, just reading what they wrote in front of me.  Yeah, and everybody knows who wrote Living La Vida Loca.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer, and I've been up since, like, oh, I don't know, yesterday. 
[00:39:30]  And the only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is O.P. and Anthony.  I'm talking 1027.  N.E.W.  Hammer.  I gotta pee.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  I'm going to be.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck radio.  Stand over. 
[00:40:00]  This is sicker than Faces of Death.  1827.  W.N.E.W.  All right, it's F.U. Friday.  212-757-1027.  I'm so excited the weekend is here.  Yeah.  Anthony's back in the studio.  He had to go check out the filling of the kiddie pool.  Dude, I'm roaring out there.  Is there anything you could add?  Of course, real fast, we've got Smelly Karen coming down for a sponge bath, a soapy sponge bath.  We're going to show her how to clean herself with some hot babes that want to, you know, sponge her down. 
[00:40:30]  And there may be some lesbian for a day stuff happening today.  And we need this kiddie pool filled up, and we have Spaz and Stinky, and they're just walking around clueless.  All I can say is it looked like, remember, I don't know, maybe the last season of Little House on the Prairie,  when the blind school burnt down, and the blind kids were trying to throw the buckets of water on the school?  Oh, my God.  I swear to God, that's what it looks like. 
[00:41:00]  What a reference.  Spaz and Stinky trying to fill up this.  Oh, my God.  I feel wrong.  They're tripping over them.  Because they're two of the most dangliest guys I've ever seen.  Big, tall, with the clumsy.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  I'm amazed any water's getting in the pool.  Yeah, instead of the blind school, it's more like the retard school is burning down.  And they're trying to put it out.  Ah.  Uh-oh.  Hey, Stinky. 
[00:41:30]  I got that one.  Oh, it's all over you.  I hit you with the water.  Oh, no.  We could do an hour of radio on this, I'm telling you.  Stinky and Spaz filling a kiddie pool.  You getting footage of that, Steve?  Because it's just, it's pathetic.  Well, because they're using a dump sink on the ninth floor, I guess.  Yeah.  And I taped the journey from the sink all the way down.  The kiddie pool journey.  Four doors, I think, cancels.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Do we have any bubble bath or anything, Rick, that we could add to the pool yet?  Yeah.  Actually, we got a whole box of stuff yesterday from Nancy and Lee, who work for the company that makes Lieber 2000.  Yeah.  Ah.  They sent us underarm deodorant, baby bath, toothbrushes.  Didn't she say she used Lieber?  Yeah.  Oh.  So she likes the Lieber.  All right.  Well, maybe she doesn't use it well enough.  I mean, they sent us tons of stuff to make sure this girl does not stink when she leaves.  All right, look it up.  Now they're, look at Spaz struggling with that bucket. 
[00:42:30]  It's just getting kind of heavy.  Well, the bucket's huge.  That's a lot of water.  Here, Steve, go get, go get Spaz real fast before he runs up to get another bucket of water.  You know what I found?  The bucket's a lot heavier, bringing it down, and it is up.  Spaz, you're sweating like a pig.  Spaz, how are you doing, man?  You all right?  It's not even a quarter full yet.  Hey, how about a microphone?  Wait, yeah, grab a microphone.  You did a little college radio in your day?  Yeah.  Yes.  A little bit?  Yes.  Go ahead.  For years.  It doesn't say anything.  It's not even a quarter full yet. 
[00:43:00]  At the soon-to-be NCAA champs, Iona College.  Yeah, that's my prediction.  You guys are on drugs.  So, Spaz, how many more trips do you think?  Many, many more.  It's not even a quarter full, and I've made at least six to eight trips.  Both me and Sneaky together, so that's about 16 trips and not even a quarter full.  16 trips, how many gallons do you think that holds, the bucket?  Stinky.  Is that a two-gallon bucket?  Stinky, get on my show. 
[00:43:30]  How are you doing, Stinky?  It's a little rough with the garbage can.  Spaz has got a handle and everything.  Ah, you have to just kind of breathe a little.  Well, Spaz is the boss, so he gets the nice bucket with the handle, and he has to use the  waste paper basket.  He's got to hug it like a baby as he's bringing it down the stairs and sloshing all over the  place.  That's great.  And it's nice and warm.  It's almost hot for the girl.  Good, because we don't want her getting too cold.  But the water's going to be cold by the time we're done.  Well, that's okay. 
[00:44:00]  You understand that.  And what's the scientific principle behind that, Spaz?  It's because warm water cools faster than cool water.  Well, you see, Genesee, warm water cools faster than cold water.  It does.  And whoopee!  Okay, terrific.  No, see, what I'm saying basically is like 80-degree water is going to cool faster than  50-degree water.  Mm-hmm.  But what if 50-degree water is faster? 
[00:44:30]  No, no, no.  The water's not cool.  Doesn't it depend on ambient temperature?  And isn't 50-degree water already cool?  Yeah, but what I'm saying is relative to room temperature.  Let's say we want the two waters to reach 32 degrees Celsius.  Yeah.  Then if one starts at 80, the other one starts at 50, the 80 is going to reach 32 before  the 50.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Where did you learn that?  I learned that in science class.  You did?  So, and what is that?  Some kind of temperature momentum that builds up?  But Spaz...  Loads of physics. 
[00:45:00]  But Spaz, aren't it...  Loads of physics.  Spaz, aren't the odds good, though, if the water in the kiddie pool is 90 degrees, that  by the time Smelly Karen shows up, that you can almost guarantee that it's going to be  over 50 degrees still?  Yeah, give or take a few.  All right.  So why would you fill up the kiddie pool with 50 degree water, knowing that it cools slower  at that temperature?  Well, it's going to probably only go down probably a few degrees by the time Karen's  done with her bath.  If you put in 50, but if you put in 80, it's going to do a rapid cool down while she's in 
[00:45:30]  there.  Rapid cool down, due to my calculations.  Which could cause a cold.  See, the electrons around the hydrogen molecule in the water.  Oh, my Lord.  That is amazing.  All right.  And have any of the girls arrive that are going to sponge down Karen?  They're on their way.  They're on their way.  Okay.  Hydrogen with an atomic number of one.  Hold on to your...  Is the first in the periodic table of elements.  If you take the hydrogen molecule with the oxygen, it makes water. 
[00:46:00]  As we like to call it, H2O.  H2O.  It's water, boy.  Gungadin.  Good boy.  By the way, Spaz was in charge of getting the girls for today's...  This is just going to be a mess.  They're on their way.  They're on their way.  They're very, very hot.  They're very hot.  Yes.  And they're willing to sponge down a smelly girl, right?  As hot as the water.  All right.  They're hot.  And they tend to cool down in room temperature.  All right.  Do you guys know how to put bubble bath in the water? 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  Just read the directions.  If you'd like me to be careful, I think.  More than a capful.  More than a capful.  Whatever direction is there.  And then you've got to slosh it around, but not until...  Why don't we have Spaz read the directions on the bubble bath?  Yeah.  Get the bubble bath.  Get the bubble bath.  Let's stop.  This is great.  You know, I went to this school, Fifth Avenue Elementary School in Northport, and it was...  For some reason, they had the retarded kids in with us.  You know, it was sort of a...  So you know that feeling.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  One of the programs where they call it mainstreaming, I think.  And I'm reliving it right now.  There was a big kid with water on the brain, and his head was twice as big as anyone else's.  And it used to almost fall, like he'd try to hold it up, and then...  It would swish around.  I'm getting that same feeling.  Like we're in special class with the retarded children.  What temperature water?  Read.  Spaz, read the directions on the back of the bubble bath.  It says, pour into running water to create a rich, luxurious, foaming cream bath for adult use only. 
[00:47:30]  So we should run down the stairs with the water?  So that's running water.  My thinking is that while I pour the water, Stinky will just pour a couple of keffels.  Oh.  Teamwork.  Look at that, working together.  This is amazing.  Boss and student.  Yes.  The master and his student.  I am the master.  You are the student.  They are sharing a brain.  And it still doesn't make one.  Appreciate that.  All right.  Well, good luck, Spaz. 
[00:48:00]  Surprise, I'm not connected at the head.  Yeah.  Oh, we ought to do that.  Conjoined Spazes.  One day, just duct tape them together and make them work.  Conjoined Spazes.  Let's do conjoined Spazes.  Come on.  We'll duct tape them together for a whole day.  Conjoined Spazes.  Conjoined Spazes.  We just need a big shirt and we're there.  That'll be hilarious.  They'll have to like.  And then you tape their inner legs together.  Yeah, they've got to work as one. 
[00:48:30]  So the one guy has to use the right leg and the other guy has to use the left leg.  We're conjoined Spazes.  I want to pursue a career as a country singer.  And he wants to be an architect.  Mark it on your calendars.  Monday show.  Monday show.  Conjoined Spazes.  A science teacher wants to tell everyone that Spaz doesn't know what he's talking about.  Brian, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  Is Spaz a graduate of high school?  We believe so, yeah.  You're going to call him on that temperature with the freezing, right? 
[00:49:00]  That is absolutely wrong.  I know it is.  We know it's wrong, too.  He's a moron.  That's some kind of rumored science urban legend that people say warm water freezes before cooler water does.  If you put in 80-degree water and 40-degree water in the freezer, the 80-degree water freezes first.  It doesn't happen like that.  Right.  It all falls down at the same degree.  I know.  He thinks some kind of a temperature momentum builds up as it goes.  It's going to pass it.  He's disretarded.  Here comes 80.  Pass it. 
[00:49:30]  Whoa, look at that.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Brian.  Love your show.  Thank you.  He doesn't understand things about, like, constants in a universe.  There are certain things that are constant.  Like, the speed of light is a constant.  And spaz being a complete friggin' idiot is a constant.  All right, listen.  A lot of people calling up just to call spaz a moron.  We already know that, so please hang up so we can get on to other things.  Matt Simotis.  Was he going to put 50-degree water in here, he said?  Yeah.  He said it would cool?  Yeah.  So it wouldn't cool.  It's all going to go to room temperature, no matter what temperature. 
[00:50:00]  I know.  You don't see the 50 won't cool as fast as 80.  It'll still be cool, you ass.  By the end of the day, it's all going to be 70 degrees.  In my world, it gets warmer.  All the people calling to say spaz is a retard or a moron or that you're embarrassed because you're an Iona grad, too.  Please hang up.  We're going to get on to other things here.  All right, Ant?  And we've got to take a break, but for the whole show, we're featuring all the most offensive songs that we have received. 
[00:50:30]  Contest, really heating up now.  The most offensive song ever written contest.  Yesterday, I mean, my God, the Baby Raper song just ran away with it.  I didn't think it was going to take the lead over Kill a Fetus.  I think because it's catchier.  It's a catchy tune that you find yourself humming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, humming at the playgrounds.  Well, I mean, we're going to do the contest for another couple of weeks, and then we're going to get the best entries,  and we're going to do a road show, and you guys are going to get to perform them live in front of our sick listeners, 
[00:51:00]  and then the listeners are going to finally decide which was the most offensive song.  It's going to look like Showtime at the Apollo.  A couple of people get up there and really hate it and pull them off with a hook.  Yeah, well, that'll be all right.  This was the second song sent in by the Baby Raper guy, Jeff, I believe, a.k.a. Fuel, right?  Right.  This was his first entry that wasn't as good, obviously, as Baby Raper.  But I've got to tell you, this one, very offensive.  And it grows on you after a while. 
[00:51:30]  This is called, How Much Is That Darky in the Window?  One, two, three, four.  How much is that darky in the window?  They say that darky is for sale.  How much is that darky in the window?  Don't make me pay extra for the mail. 
[00:52:00]  I must take a trip to California.  And I need someone to mow my lawn.  If I dive that darky on the long chain.  He can get the job done while I'm gone.  How much is that darky in the window? 
[00:52:30]  The one with the long gangly arms.  How much is that dark in the window?  I've got things need pickin' on my arm.  I have a wife.  What needs a beatin'?  But I can't afford to go to jail. 
[00:53:00]  How much is that darky in the window?  I can't give what's comin' to that well.  How much is that dark in the window?  My team could use a D.H.  They say that darky don't get cocaine. 
[00:53:30]  I can't afford to rehab his whole race.  How much is that dark in the window?  They say that darky is for sale.  How much is that dark in the window? 
[00:54:00]  Don't make me pay extra.  Cause he's mail.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Throw men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1027.  WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself cause I've got them both.  Look at that weirdo.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:54:30]  It's FU Friday with O and A.  Come on.  Finishing the week of radio off in style, Anthony, huh?  It's FU Friday and we're not getting many good FUs.  If someone did you wrong this week,  we could tell 2 million people for you.  All you have to do is fax the info at 212-957-9639.  That's the best way to do it, right, Ant? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Also, we're taking your votes for Bit of the Week.  Lots and lots of things to choose from this week, that's for sure.  Oh, yeah.  Dice getting a lot of votes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I did have the dice on, didn't I?  Uh, the ass, uh, the ass exam by Ed Wynn is getting a lot of votes.  Charlton Heston getting a lot of votes.  Yeah.  Uh, the Jamaican, uh, diarrhea bit getting lots of votes this week.  And, of course, the, uh, the most offensive songs that came in. 
[00:55:30]  They were wonderful.  But that's a, that's a given.  We're going to play, uh, both Kill a Fetus and, uh, Baby Raper later on today on the show.  And I guess, uh, Smelly Karen has a ride for her, for her sponge bath.  All right.  Well, how does she smell?  Uh, yeah, we told her not to shower.  I don't want to smell it, man.  Uh, Jim, what's going on?  What's up, man?  That darky song, man, is putting you to sleep.  Yeah, you didn't like that one?  Nah, nah, I think the kitten's more offensive, but.  Yeah, well, that one's not in the running anymore. 
[00:56:00]  I mean, even Jeff, the guy who wrote it, said, yeah, I know.  That one wasn't as good as the other one he came up with.  Yeah, that's cool, man.  Not every song the Stones writes is a, a huge hit.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly, man.  You got to hear the other.  You guys are great, man.  You got to hear the other song the guy, uh, came up with if you haven't heard it yet.  I missed it yesterday.  Well.  I was going nuts trying to hear it.  I missed it yesterday.  You want to hear something very, very offensive.  You keep listening to this radio show today.  I will, as I do every single day.  All right, Jim, thank you.  All right, guys.  All right, let's go to James.  James, you're next on N.E.W. 
[00:56:30]  What's up?  Yeah, hi, guys.  Hi.  Yeah, uh, a couple of things.  I wanted to say Baby Raper was definitely the most offensive song.  Yeah.  That thing was, oh, God.  My friend, he told me about, uh, the Killer Feetus song.  Yeah.  And he calls me up and he's like, I missed it at first.  So I taped it.  Then I go back and Baby Raper comes on.  He missed that.  I played it out for him today.  He started crying.  That was hilarious.  Well, we've decided that we're going to get all the, uh, the finalists and they're going  to perform their, uh, songs live at the next road show. 
[00:57:00]  You guys should do a poll on the unofficial website to, uh, to see who wins.  Well, no, I think we want to do it in front of everybody, you know, at a road show.  It would be cool to see these guys perform them live and stuff, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  One other thing, though.  Yeah.  My friend, right, he has a wow sign in school, a load of us do.  Uh-huh.  He just got called down to Dean yesterday.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he got in a load of trouble.  They didn't even know what it meant.  Uh-oh.  One teacher found out what it meant.  She tells the Dean.  Yeah.  He gets in a load of trouble for it.  Man.  It really sucks.  In a few weeks, everyone's going to know what wow is again, so. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Everyone's pissed off on the instant feedback that the spaz cam is upside down.  Is it really?  Yeah.  It's broadcasting upside down.  We were trying to get a shot of the pool outside the studio door, but the cord on the spaz  cam isn't long enough, I don't think.  Let me see.  How are we going to get out there?  How much more room I got on this?  Not much, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We're just trying to.  The listeners want to see what the pool looks like and stuff.  What we're going to have to do is move the, maybe move the computer. 
[00:58:00]  And it might give us a few more feet?  Over there, and then we could put the camera outside.  You want to ask Spaz and Stinky?  Oh, yeah.  Tell them we have a dilemma in the studio?  I mean, we should definitely move it.  We're going to move it a little bit?  I mean, this is something that should be available for people to see.  Yeah, definitely.  You've got to see the kiddie pool.  Paul, what's going on?  It's FU Friday, man.  Hey, what's going on?  It's a big FU to myself.  Why to yourself? 
[00:58:30]  Well, I promised I would never do this, but my ex-wife, I'd see her once a week to see  the kid, and we got a little romantic.  I wound up banging her.  Jesus Christ.  You banged your ex-wife?  Yeah, and here's the deal.  About eight months ago, she leaves me because I'm not making enough money anymore because  I left Wall Street, right?  Yeah.  For my big, hairy, next-door neighbor.  So when things didn't work out with those two, right, I, you know, still see my kids 
[00:59:00]  on the weekend.  And yesterday was weird.  She goes, I broke up with this guy, blah, blah, blah.  And she did what she always does.  And what all women do.  She came on to me, and one thing led to another.  A big pony came out, and, sorry.  And I had bangs, and I felt disgusted.  I mean, I felt relieved, but I actually gave her money.  So she's a prostitute, and I guess I'm a pimp.  You're a John.  You're a John, yeah.  Yeah, I'm a John. 
[00:59:30]  Well, anyway, F you to myself.  You guys rule the friggin' world.  So, uh, is she calling you today?  Well, I have to actually go see her again, but I brought my brother with me, like, protection.  Very.  To get me away from her.  And how much child support are you paying her?  I don't know.  Is this a question you need to know for, like, part of your...  Well, I don't want to get it to Anthony.  It's like $400, and then $400 for the kids.  It's not that much.  I can afford it.  But, uh, she left me because I was a high-priced Wall Street broker.  But when I said, after 11 years, I'm burnt out, 40 pounds overweight, and going to AA meetings. 
[01:00:00]  I said, let me take a job for $45,000 and see if my nice, sweet wife will agree to it all.  And she was like, yeah, for eight months.  And then when we downsized, and no more actor, no more explorer, we've got to drive an 86-billard?  And she banged the next-door neighbor, a big hairy guy.  You know he was hung, too.  So I felt ridiculous.  Dude, how much were you making before you downsized yourself? 
[01:00:30]  I would say, uh, close, uh, more than the president.  That's what was my claim to say.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  But I'm very happy now.  I hang out with my brother.  The two of us are dependent on alcoholic gamblers.  When the weekend comes, we're very, very good for the kids.  We don't drink around them.  And we take them ice skating, and we take them to the planetarium.  I'm a good dad.  So yesterday, I broke down, and the guy drooled. 
[01:01:00]  No, that's all right.  You're cursed there.  That's all right.  But you feel crappy today because you did your ex-wife.  Yeah.  Was the sex good last night?  I was finished in about three seconds.  I made her, I hope I can say this.  I'll be polite.  Yeah.  I made her do like a, in her bathroom, you got one of those red lights.  So it was like, you know, it was like a little, you know, porno action.  And I couldn't have been in there for more than three seconds.  And I said, come on, come on, Fred. 
[01:01:30]  All right, all right, all right.  Hello.  Move your cheeks around.  Take a look.  Yeah.  And that was all I needed.  But, hey, after eight months, it worked for me.  So you haven't been sleeping with any other girls since you broke up with your wife, I'm assuming, huh?  Guess.  Now, you're not going to believe this, but it's absolutely true.  I get back at her the second week after she, um, second week after she, uh.  Turn down your radio, Dave.  You're getting distracted.  Go ahead. 
[01:02:00]  Continue your story.  The second week after, this is ridiculous.  The second week after I found out that she, uh, you know, was screwing the next door neighbor, I sought out his wife and met her.  Yeah.  Fine date.  Yeah.  The most horrible, ugliest pig.  But I did it anyway.  Because I was, I got revenge, man.  So.  Wow.  It was disgusting.  What a mess.  Yeah.  You know what?  But I'm happy now.  You know why?  Because I got you guys to at least get me through the day.  There you go.  All right.  As long as you have us.  Well, Paul, uh, has a big F you to himself for banging his ex-wife. 
[01:02:30]  Rock.  Right.  All right.  And, um, love to my brother Johnny Balkans out there.  Thanks, guys.  You rule the world.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Love you.  There he goes.  See you, pal.  Bye.  Burnt out Wall Street guy.  Speaking of Wall Street, how did we do today, Anthony?  Uh, oh my God.  You know something?  We must be having a busy show.  You haven't checked once.  Yeah, really?  No, I, I, I dumped out of a couple of things today, Opie.  Yeah.  That's why I haven't really been, I haven't had to pay attention to the, uh, constant ups 
[01:03:00]  and downs of some of these stocks.  Let's see.  Oh, Dow is down to 81, just about 82.  And the NASDAQ, uh, yeah, pretty much unchanged.  What?  Up two.  Yeah.  All right.  NASDAQ had a pretty good week, huh?  Yeah.  Yes.  Record territory.  Yes.  As they say.  All right.  Well, um, we should get an update, see what's going on out there.  Rick!  What?  We need an update.  What's going on out there with the kiddie pool?  We're about two buckets away. 
[01:03:30]  There goes the sass cam.  The sass cam just fell off the ceiling.  Holy cow.  Did it break?  No, it's cool.  I'm going to look and see what shot that came out of that one.  But, uh, we're about two buckets away.  The, uh, the retards are bringing down the last two buckets.  Karen loves the, uh, the pool.  Yeah, you like it?  Here comes smelly Karen.  But she's not as rank as I think we wanted her to be, so I'm thinking of sending her out  for a couple laps around the block.  Wait, take your, take your microphone.  Yeah.  Get the mic. 
[01:04:00]  I do.  Yeah, you gotta, she's gotta get sweaty.  Yeah.  You're not stinky?  Just so people could appreciate the stench.  Oh, she wouldn't know.  She has no sense of smell.  She has no sense of smell.  Who's going to, get stinky in here.  He knows stink.  He does?  Well, actually, he doesn't know stink.  Get, get spaz in here.  They're both upstairs.  Oh, they're both upstairs?  Oh, when the next bucket comes down, he's spaz in here.  Stinky.  Direct under armpit whiff.  Get stinky in here.  Stink.  Karen, lift up your arm. 
[01:04:30]  Stink.  This is some, this is the, you know, some of the stuff you have to do for the show.  Now, uh, smell her underarm.  Get closer.  It's not really that bad.  It's not bad, huh?  Here we go.  It's the last.  See, thank you.  Grab the, grab the mic.  Because I got a lot of crap.  Because I was the only one that spoke up.  Because she smelled so bad.  Here we go.  How bad did she smell last time she was here, Stinky?  You were here.  All right, I don't want to offend you or anything.  No, go ahead.  It's, it's a little bit too late for that.  You sat on my lap with your arm around my shoulder. 
[01:05:00]  And I went home and I smelled my shoulder.  And it smelled really bad.  And I thought it was me.  So I checked the other shoulder and didn't smell at all.  So.  So you're saying her stench was on your clothes.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were, you were humming last time you came in here.  Uh, Karen, let me tell you something.  This is coming from Stinky.  There's only one reason why we call him Stinky.  Because the first time he came to this damn station, he reeked. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, man.  I'm, oh, God.  Yeah.  Don't feel bad.  All right.  See, that's why we have you in here today, to get scrubbed down.  But now it.  You're going to tell something to me.  It seems that.  Well, Opie finally did.  Opie finally offended you.  Everyone, everyone, everyone was smelling you, and I was the only one that spoke up.  Everyone knew.  Behind your back, while you were naked and stuff, they're like, oh, my God.  Hi, God.  Is Spaz out there?  Yeah.  Spaz, come here. 
[01:06:00]  We're going to need your confirmation now?  Spaz, you got to smell Karen's, Karen's left arm.  Stinky.  No, the other arm.  Check the, yeah.  Come here.  Spaz is sweating.  He's been working really hard today.  All right, Spaz.  Wow.  Are you serious?  All right, get on mic.  Oh, God, I'm getting that feeling again.  What's the matter, Spaz?  Stinky said she wasn't that bad.  Well, Stinky didn't smell that armpit.  Wow, maybe it's just a one armpit.  What?  Go ahead, Stinky.  Smell that armpit.  Smell that armpit.  Yeah, it's a little more raw than the last one. 
[01:06:30]  A little more raw.  That's totally ridiculous.  Can we have her run up and down the stairs?  My alley is totally screwed up.  Yeah, we should send her on a few laps around the block.  Oh, great.  Yeah, can we, uh...  I walked from Penn Station.  Can someone get a cell phone and have Karen walk around the block a couple times?  We'll check in with you guys.  Yeah.  Come on.  Hi, dude.  I walked from Penn Station to the apartment.  We need to, we need you to smell a little worse than you are now.  Maybe she doesn't have to walk or anything. 
[01:07:00]  Maybe we can have her exercise in here or something.  It would be funny if she just, if she walks around the block a couple times.  A few times?  What do you think?  We should do it.  All right.  And go out with the cell phone?  Yeah.  And then they can stop at certain points and take a whiff.  Do we have any sweatshirts we can have her put on to really generate you?  Oh, yeah.  I have a flannel.  You have vinyl?  Flannel.  Oh, flannel.  Vinyl, yeah.  Wrap her up in saran.  That would reek.  Who's going to hit the street with her?  Psycho Mark or Rick? 
[01:07:30]  I'm busy.  Rick?  I'm busy.  All right.  All right.  I'll do it.  All right.  We'll check in with Rick and Smelly Karen as they do a couple laps around the block before  her sponge bath, Anthony, okay?  Rah-ha.  What's up, Psycho Mark?  Dude, we've got a lot of water out there.  If that...  Yeah, we want to talk about what'll happen if anything happens.  We know.  The building's going to get pissed at us again.  Spence made a little accent, spilled some already on the floor.  A little out of the bucket, ain't it?  All right, Rick, get outside.  Right after commercials, we're going to check in with you, okay? 
[01:08:00]  And then we're going to get her in the kiddie pool in like 20 minutes.  Did the ladies arrive?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Oh, good.  They're on their way.  All right.  And we've got to take a break.  All right.  You guys can vote for Bit of the Week still.  Also featuring all the offensive songs that we have for the Opie and Anthony show.  All day long today we're doing that, right, Ant?  Yeah.  Still to come, Kill a Fetus and the Baby Raper song that everyone's talking about today.  People liking Smelly Karen. 
[01:08:30]  Yo, guys, Smelly Karen is cute.  Seems to be nicely put together from Stephen's Staten Island.  Yeah, we just think she'd be hotter if she didn't smell.  That's all.  That's why the, you know, the sponge bath today.  Yeah.  We're trying to do a service here.  Is she single?  It's an opening Anthony charity show today.  You like her, though?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, so on the way, Kill a Fetus and the Baby Raper song.  But another offensive song from Stephen Lynch, Anthony. 
[01:09:00]  Yes.  As we feature all the offensive songs on the show today.  Opie.  Opie.  I have water retention.  Opie's on the rack.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  Opie, you are such a whoopin'.  Oh, come on!  Opie, what color panties you wear?  Uh, only a bag, whatever.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah, that's pretty gay, man.  Opie, you are such a whoopin'.  Why am I such a fad?  Why am I such a fad?  I have water retention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah, that's pretty gay, man. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, I want to give Al Wilker the rusty poobah.  Whatever you say on this ends up on some wacky pro.  Oh, you got me.  1027 WNEW.  And it's FU Friday.  Still taking your votes for a bit of the week.  The dice bid is in the lead slightly as we speak.  Make sure you get your vote in before we play that.  We'll probably do that after Smelly Karen gets her sponge bat.  Glenn, on the instant feedback from Queens, who do you think smells worse, Smelly Karen or McCain, when he was in the gook cage for six years? 
[01:10:00]  Oh, that's not right.  It's not right, but that's coming in on the instant feedback, Anthony.  Jesus.  Speaking of Smelly Karen, she showed up.  We told her not to shower today.  She showered this morning.  She's smelling, but not as bad as we would like her to smell.  So, yeah, she's, well, we figured she better work up a sweat, work up a stank.  So, Rick's outside the studio making her walk around the block to get her humming. 
[01:10:30]  We want a real stank.  I want her to get in that pool and see an oil slick.  We are messed up.  Rick, what's going on?  Rick?  Did we lose Rick?  Hold on.  Let me try that again.  There we go.  Hey, Rick.  Guys.  What's up, buddy?  Wow, we got her working.  Yeah?  Yeah, we've got, I got Steve out here with me.  We first had her do some steps Rocky style.  Right.  Entering the building.  Then I had to do some push-ups and jumping jacks to get a stink going.  And now I've got her running back and forth on the red-eye grill. 
[01:11:00]  Come on, Smelly's caters.  Come on.  You've got to want it.  Come on, Smelly.  I got your water right here.  I think she's going to puke.  And she's starting to sweat?  Well, we put actually like two more sweatshirts and a t-shirt on her.  Yeah.  And she's dying.  Yeah.  Smelly caters, how are you feeling, Smelly?  I'm done.  She's done?  I'm done.  Freaking breathe, God damn it.  Is she sweating, Rick? 
[01:11:30]  That's the key to that.  I think so.  Can you lift the shirt up real quick?  Steve, get the camera here.  I want to see if there's some sweat dripping down these pits.  Rick, I think you've got to take one for the team and go in for a little whiff.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to.  Hold on.  Just a little one.  A little whiff.  Oh, Jesus.  She's getting ripe.  She's pretty bad.  She's not quite there yet, though.  All right.  You've got to do some more.  Do some jumping jacks.  Do some jumping jacks, Smelly.  So she's doing jumping jacks where?  Right in front of the red-eye grill? 
[01:12:00]  Right on the corner of 56th and 7th in front of the red-eye grill, yeah.  Okay.  She looks like she's going to puke.  Really?  Is her face getting all red and stuff?  Actually, she's turning white.  So I'm just going to water because I don't want to die on us before we play either.  All right.  I think we're looking for a few more girls as well to come on down to sponge down Karen.  Yeah.  I guess as many girls as want to come down.  The cleaner, the better.  If there's any civilians that want to give Karen a sponge bath, I mean, it's looking great out there. 
[01:12:30]  The kiddie pool, the suds are in there.  It smells nice out there.  It smells very nice.  Go ahead.  We have a very nice display outside the studio door, Anthony.  Jesus, man.  Rick is a psychotic mother effer.  I think he really has some problems and some issues.  He enjoys, like, abusing girls, I believe.  I totally do.  No, you know what it is, guys?  I think we're just all dicks.  Pull up us into that one.  I got my own problems. 
[01:13:00]  You stop.  All right.  Well, Rick, we'll check in with you in a little bit.  What?  It's nine floors up to the studio.  I think we're going to have her run the stairs, too.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I think she's going down.  Uh-oh.  Is she all right?  Come on.  She's coughing.  Are you going to kill her?  All right, dude, stop.  Yeah, don't kill the girl.  Rick is an animal, man.  Just relax, man.  It's all over.  Get her back up here, all right?  She's good.  If there's any ladies in the area that want to sponge down Karen, we have, I think, one 
[01:13:30]  that have showed up so far, Anthony.  So we need a few more.  If you're in the area, take one for the team.  Come down here.  Get in the kiddie pool with smelly Karen, okay?  What the hell is that?  That was one of the listeners walking by screaming, feel the burn.  Feel the burn.  All right.  We're on our way up, guys.  All right.  Hang on.  Ben wants to talk to you a little bit.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  This phone won't hang up.  Ah, there we go. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, okay.  Very good.  Did I send an LFU?  Yeah, go ahead.  To the management over here.  Why?  Why?  They're good.  Three and a half goddamn weeks to fix your goddamn speaker over there.  What speaker?  Whatever that thing is.  Microphone.  Oh, he's talking about the telephones.  Three and a half weeks.  Oh, he's got a bang on it.  Boom, boom, boom.  I know.  They'll figure out the phones eventually, yeah.  Ben, any of the girls show up yet?  Nobody here yet.  Spaz was in charge of getting the girls.  Oh, boy.  Spaz was in charge of getting the girls today.  Come on.  Swear to you. 
[01:14:30]  Come on.  If this doesn't happen today, there's going to be hell to pay with Spaz.  Hell to pay.  You know, he's taking a pretty big chance, taking that responsibility on himself.  I had it for a year and a half.  He took it over now.  All right.  Call up privilege.  We need some girls.  I just said.  What?  I just said, call Laszlo.  Really?  Call Mike from Misbehavin'.  See if he's got anybody.  Should we send out the bat signal to privilege, Anthony?  Ben, go find out what's going on, because one of the guys is here that was supposed to  bring the girls.  Let's see where we stand.  We have to have girls that don't mind having their faces on the web. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, that's true, too.  That's what it is.  We had a problem with the strippers last time.  They didn't want to be on the website.  Yeah.  Good.  Why?  Why?  Why did we leave Spaz to this?  He's like, the guy he's with that's supposed to get the girls is like, well, one of them's  working until seven, and now the other one's sick.  Oh, my God.  What up?  Are you kidding?  He's cool.  Oh, God.  I knew this was going to happen. 
[01:15:30]  It was pretty funny, though.  Oh, boy.  What?  He wants to explain the phones.  I'm not talking about the phones now.  It's all right.  There's like soda or something in this, Pete.  I don't think it's Pete's fault.  Oh, my God.  I want to talk about the girls.  I don't want to talk about the phones.  Spaz.  Spaz, where are the girls?  You suck.  You suck.  This whole thing was arranged.  We had two girls set up as a flashlight. 
[01:16:00]  One girl got sick, and because one girl got sick, the other one says, well, I'm not coming  alone.  So now we're scrambling for backups.  Scrambling for backups.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  The one that Rick's set up isn't here either.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, what can you do for us?  Get on the phone.  I'll be back in 10 minutes.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  If they get sick, it's not my fault.  Welcome to the world of producing a radio show.  It happens all the time.  People back up.  All right.  We'll make this happen.  Dan, what's going on?  I was just, I work at the morning building next door. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  And looking downstairs, he's kicking her in the butt and making her run back and forth.  You've got to get a heavier coat on her, though.  Oh, really?  You can see Rick working, Karen?  Oh, definitely.  She's touching the 888 sign.  Fire spaz indication now.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  This is good.  Let's go to Jamie.  Jamie, what's up?  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, do you remember a bit long, long time ago about that damn boy George song?  Yeah, Karma Chameleon. 
[01:17:00]  Well, I still got that freaking thing stuck on my head.  I just want to send an FU out to you for that.  Oh, well, a lot of people humming Baby Raper today.  The same way a lot of people were humming the Karma Chameleon.  Yeah.  I can't get it out of my head.  All right.  Well, have a good weekend, Jamie.  Peace out, Dreamweaver.  Peace out, Dreamweaver.  All right.  Rick, spaz has wrecked a bit.  Yeah, I know.  Rick, back in the studio with Smelly Karen Anthony.  Hey, Ben.  You know what's funny about this?  Remember how excited he got in the meeting, like, that he was, like, going to set something up? 
[01:17:30]  Spaz thought he was ready to deliver.  Spaz thought he was ready to step up.  What happened?  Well, we're having a problem getting girls once again.  I can't understand why.  Oh, my God.  So we need ladies to show up immediately.  It just never fails.  To our radio station.  It just never fails.  We'll figure it.  We'll pull this out of our butt once again. 
[01:18:00]  Spaz is down the hall freaking out.  I just want to know why Spaz was left in charge.  Well, we were...  I kind of threw him a bone.  Yeah, we were hoping...  A bone.  Two girls, like, on Tuesday or whatever it was?  We were hoping that he was ready for this, but, uh, obviously he's not ready yet.  He blew it.  He blew it.  No, no, no.  You've got to keep that on.  She's got to shed.  She's sweating like a pig.  Exactly.  Let her shed and then let Stinky smell to see, you know, where we stand with her. 
[01:18:30]  Now everyone's scrambling, trying to figure out what to do now.  Well, I'm going to go make a phone call.  I'll be back.  All right.  Leave it to Spaz.  That's great.  That's good.  Wonderful.  Hey, John, you're next on NAW.  How you doing, guys?  Real good.  What's up?  Listen, I just want to thank you.  You got me laid the other night.  How did we do that?  Well, I was at one of these boring corporate functions that they have, you know, like one of these rah-rah sessions. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  More importantly, afterwards, was the cocktail party and dinner.  So we're all sitting around the table, drinking, having a good time, laughing, and the topic of music came up.  I turn around and say, I listen to you guys in the afternoon.  This chick across from me, who's a fan of yours, said, yeah, I listen to him, too, everything else.  We're laughing, having a good time.  A few minutes later, we're having dinner.  I look her straight in the eye, and I say, Mohawk?  Her eyes just bugged out. 
[01:19:30]  The food came flying out of her mouth.  Mohawk or triangle, yeah.  So she wouldn't answer me.  I said, nobody at the table knew what was going on.  She caught a composure.  She didn't answer me, so I asked her again.  Mohawk?  She said, no.  I said, triangle?  She said, no.  I look at her, I go, bare floor?  And the table just didn't know what we were talking about, except for me and her.  Yeah.  One thing led to another. 
[01:20:00]  We'd go back to her place, and we took care of business.  Oh, very nice.  Look at that.  I just wanted to call you guys up and thank you for the nice keywords there.  How about that?  Hey, John, what station gets you laid?  One-oh-two-seven, boys.  Good.  Very good.  Yes, your vagina station.  Your balloon knot station.  Balloon knot radio.  Balloon knot station.  All right, thank you, John.  Peter from Bayshore.  Later.  Cool.  Peter from Bayshore.  Spaz, you effing idiot.  But a big F you to Opie and Anthony for trusting Spaz with such a responsibility. 
[01:20:30]  A-holes.  Yeah, well, you know what?  We're going to have to take a little responsibility for this, Anthony.  We thought maybe Spaz had it in him to produce a segment for our radio show, and this is what we get.  Spaz, if you screw this up, I am personally going to come down there from Long Island and drown you in the toilet.  Now, have faith in us, guys.  It'll happen.  Robert, what's up?  Hey, I got an idea to try to save your show.  Yes.  Stinky's got to get in the tub there, and Spaz has to wash him down. 
[01:21:00]  You know what?  Get Spaz and Stinky in here.  I'm telling you right now, we're going to put a time limit.  Oh, my God, no.  We're putting a time limit.  Look at Stinky panicking.  You're going in that freaking kiddie pool with Spaz, and someone's going to be sponging someone.  If we don't get girls down here to sponge off Karen, I swear to God, you and Spaz, Stinky and Spaz,  we'll end up in that kiddie pool scrubbing each other in the gayest scene ever to take place. 
[01:21:30]  Just like the scene in, oh, God, help me out here.  Tony Curtis, Spaz, Spartacus.  Thank you, Steve.  Hey, Spartacus.  Sponge me off.  And if they don't do it, they're fired.  Fired.  Sponge me down, don't you know?  Hey, Spaz, wash my crotch.  Look at Rick.  It took Rick two minutes.  Maybe Rick should spaz it on Stinky down. 
[01:22:00]  Look at Stinky's heart stock because he really was scared that, you know, it's still going to happen.  Hey, Stinky, there ain't no girls down here yet.  Hey, Robert, thanks for that, all right?  All right.  All right.  All right.  This is the deal.  If the girls don't come down here to sponge down Smelly Karen, Stinky and Spaz are going in that kiddie pool and sponging each other down.  Without a doubt.  I'm going to cancel the girls right now.  And I'm telling you right now, if they don't do it, they're done.  Done.  Done from this show.  Done. 
[01:22:30]  I'm available.  I'll take the entrance.  But it looks like we might have some girls coming down.  Yep.  Rick?  Yep.  How many?  Where are they coming from?  Long Island?  Laszlo over Privilege.  Oh, they're coming from Privilege?  Yeah.  All right.  He said they should be there within the next 10 or 15 minutes.  I'll throw them in the cab and send them right over.  All right.  Very good.  We'll save this.  Why is the camera there?  We're in front of Stinky's face now.  I don't know.  We should have a good camera shot at the pool.  All right.  Well, get Stinky back in here because Smelly Karen is done working out. 
[01:23:00]  We've got to see what she smells like now.  Yeah.  Stinky?  Did you work up her sweat, Karen?  At all?  Yeah?  Karen, talk into the mic.  Yes.  I'm very tired.  What do you want from me?  Wow.  She's cranky, too.  Stinky and cranky.  All right.  Lift that on.  Get the nose right.  No, no, no.  Go for the good pit.  The left one.  Yeah, we know the left one was barking.  Right in there.  Closer.  Oh, my God.  Close enough.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Where's Spaz?  Make Spaz smell. 
[01:23:30]  He might be down for the count.  You don't know where Spaz is?  Spaz is all depressed.  I searched the whole station for Spaz.  Oh, my God.  Did he jump finally?  Did he go to the roof and jump?  I hope.  Oh, no.  Spaz, did he walk out?  Yeah, Spaz is all depressed because his segment went horribly wrong.  His segment.  He was trying to produce a segment, you know.  He produced a segment, then it went wrong.  And now he's like, he can't be found.  He's never going to produce another segment.  I think he finally snapped on us, Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  I'm never going to be able to produce.  Does anyone know where I could get a high-powered rifle?  I'm climbing to the roof.  Yeah, we see Spaz fall from the window, in front of the window.  All right, well, the kiddie pool's ready, Anthony.  Yeah.  The bubble bath is in there.  Mm-hmm.  Karen reeks.  And we got girls on the way, so.  Check, check, check.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  How are you?  All right, I want to give an F you to whoever started saying, okay, terrific.  Why?  Because I said it in economics class today to my teacher, and he almost tore me a new ass. 
[01:24:30]  Okay, terrific.  You got to say it like that, too.  Oh, I did.  Okay, terrific.  This guy yells at everybody.  Yeah.  Oh, it was awesome.  All right, Matt, thank you.  All right, thank you.  Syndication now.  Cool.  Yes.  All right, bye.  Bye.  All right, Anthony, we're going to take a break.  We're going to try to find Spaz to see if he's killed himself.  I think he did.  He's gone.  Stinky can't find him.  Stinky, where's your boss?  I have no idea.  I looked all over the office, looked in the bathroom.  If he doesn't come back, guess what? 
[01:25:00]  You might be getting a promotion already.  All right.  Well, listen, we'll try to find him, Anthony.  This is amazing.  Spaz has disappeared.  Yeah.  So upset that his segment went awry.  Yeah.  I was producing your segment.  You know, in all fairness, the guy was really excited about his little segment today.  But, like, we were, like, you know, backing off and letting Spaz make the phone calls.  And, you know, he was reporting back to us in meetings and stuff.  You know what this is like? 
[01:25:30]  Remember when Mr. Brady gave Greg Brady the plans?  And he was supposed to bring them.  Remember?  He drew up the plans.  And Greg was supposed to take them to wherever the hell Mr. Brady worked.  And he lost them.  And what was in the canister instead?  No, that was the other time at the amusement park.  Oh, with the plans.  Yeah.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Okay.  This is when Greg got a job with Mike Brady.  Okay.  And he was, like, a delivery guy.  And he lost the plans. 
[01:26:00]  That's right.  So, then, to make it up to him and get his confidence back up, Mike had to go crawling to his boss and say, look, please give the kid another chance.  He's going to be effed up for life, you know?  So, they give him another chance.  And what does Greg do?  Loses it again.  He effed up again.  But then, just by luck, he kind of got at him.  Yeah.  That's the spaz situation.  All right.  He was so excited about his little plan.  His little segment.  I don't think we should give him a second chance, though.  He had notes and everything.  Yeah.  And he kept checking with them. 
[01:26:30]  What, Ben?  He raised his hand in the meeting.  He raised his hand and said, you could count on me.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that in the meeting with Jeremy.  Yeah.  Our boss was sitting there and Spaz is in there.  I'd like to suggest something.  I can get the girls.  To Sponged Down.  To Sponged Down, Karen.  Karen.  This could be him.  I am in charge.  I can do this.  I can.  Jim on line nine wants Spaz to sniff Karen for cranky ass.  Karen, have you ever gotten cranky ass? 
[01:27:00]  You know what that is?  I think I do.  I don't even want to know.  As far as Bill Brady says, Cal, Bill, Bill, our pal.  Well, cranky ass is like if you, you know, pop a nugget, like a milk dud, and then walk  about a half mile.  Nuh-uh.  No, never.  Then all of a sudden, you got cranky ass.  You know, you pop a nugget and don't clean up too well back there.  You got to walk about a mile.  I wouldn't know, so.  All right.  Why?  Because I wouldn't smell it.  Yeah, she has no idea.  She doesn't know.  She can't.  Smelly Karen cannot smell.  If and when Spaz comes back here, he's got to check her for cranky ass. 
[01:27:30]  No one's ever notified me of having it, so.  So, you know what?  And you're wearing, like, overalls, so it's easy.  He could just pull the back out and give a good whiff to see if she's got cranky ass.  That's his punishment.  Yeah.  Then we'll forgive him.  Forgive him?  Well, we have to forgive him.  This is the funniest thing ever.  That Spaz is so upset.  He was so excited about this.  This is better than if it went perfectly by plan there, you know?  It's like telling an eight-year-old that the Disney trip is off. 
[01:28:00]  Like, that's how upset Spaz is right now.  He's, like, sulking somewhere.  I don't know where he went.  He's weeping somewhere?  Psycho Mark, can you find him?  I don't know, but he's really upset, dude.  We know he's upset.  Where is he?  Rick was riding him pretty hard.  No, is he really upset?  He was steaming, dude.  I thought he was going to rip Rick's throat out.  So, where is he now?  I don't know.  Take your phone and go try to find him.  He's on the street.  He's probably on the street.  He's around here somewhere.  He's around here somewhere. 
[01:28:30]  No, go find him with the cell phone.  I'm serious.  And then call the show.  It's special class.  I swear to God.  Oh, man.  You've got to calm him down.  All right, Anthony, we're going to retar.  We've got to take a break.  We'll try to find Spaz.  The girls are on the way.  The backup plan is happening as we speak.  And Smelly Karen will get her a little sponge bath and maybe some lesbianism today, once again.  Any girls want to come down, she is very good looking.  She just has an odor problem that we're going to take care of. 
[01:29:00]  We're taking care of that.  All right, Anthony, also on the show today, we're playing all the offensive songs.  Yes.  We are doing the Most Offensive Song Contest.  You still have time to get your song in.  All the finalists will be at our next road show, it's looking like, around, I don't know, mid-April.  And you'll be able to perform your Most Offensive Song in front of everybody.  Thousands of people will be watching you do your song.  All right, and it's time to play the one everyone is talking about, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's time.  We've got a couple more we're going to play today, but... 
[01:29:30]  What?  Well, we might be looking for a replacement for Spaz.  What's the problem?  His jacket and his bag are gone.  What did you do?  I heard you were yelling and screaming at him.  I said, Spaz, I thought you had this taken care of.  Yeah, but, you know, the girl started, you know, she got sick and her friend didn't want to come down.  I go, but you've got to make sure this is taken care of, and you've got to have a backup.  And then he snapped at me. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, he did?  And he started yelling at me.  I'm like, dude, don't effing snap at me.  I go, this is your problem.  Now I've got to fix it.  Oh, my God.  To Spaz's, you know, credit, sometimes things like this do happen.  I mean, you know, you can't totally razz the guy, but...  Well, no, that's why I mentioned to him, I said, make sure this is all set.  If you need a couple others, make sure you let me know, or we'll have backup.  I got it.  And he said, no, these are good.  I'm on it.  These are good.  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:30]  So he walked?  He walked.  He walked.  He left.  Holy cow.  All right, we've got to get his side of the story.  I don't think he jumped on a train.  He's somewhere around here.  We've got to find him.  They took his bag and his jacket.  They're gone.  That was great.  Page him or something.  Corky's out there alone in New York City.  Jesus.  What a mess.  This show, I swear to God, it's like some kind of goddamn drug rehab place.  What's up?  He's our own little strawberry. 
[01:31:00]  You know, I got to say it.  I got to stick up for Spaz.  I feel really bad for him.  Because the guy is trying to make it.  He's, you know, it was his little statement.  I just feel so bad.  He was so proud of himself.  And he, well, it was his first real responsibility for the show.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like he does things and stuff.  But this was his first real responsibility that only he was in control of.  And it flopped.  Flopped.  You know, he finally mastered the picking up of lunch. 
[01:31:30]  And we figured he was ready for the next step.  He was delegating responsibility to other people to pick up lunch and answer the phones.  And he finally figured he was up a notch where now he can help contribute to the show.  He didn't have to get the coffee anymore, you know?  He graduated to getting the smoothies.  And what happened?  And what happened?  It all came crashing down in one horrible afternoon.  All right.  Well, if Spaz is listening, he's got to call the show.  We want his side of the story. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, call up.  Yeah, nut.  All right, Anthony, with that, we do have to take a break.  But before we do so, yeah, this is the one everyone's talking about as we do our most offensive  sewing contest, okay?  All right.  It's Jeff, a.k.a. Fuel.  Well, you'll know the title of the song in a minute here, okay?  All right.  Here it is, everybody humming this today all over the tri-state area.  The other inmates think I'm kind of sick 
[01:32:30]  Because of where I like to dip my stick  And how I always talk about the day  I met that little hearty John today 
[01:33:00]  I wish that they could somehow understand  I'm just an average ordinary man  But somehow they just can't seem to get  But Maggie Simpson always makes me wet 
[01:33:30]  Baby raper  I'm a baby raper  The sweet and young  They're good enough to eat  Baby raper  I'm a baby raper 
[01:34:00]  The youngest cherries  I always taste so sweet  I pick my states up at the dipstick store  When mommy turns away  I go for more  Sing their songs  And tell them that they're sweet  As I slip the little booties 
[01:34:30]  As I slip the little booties off their feet  Baby raper  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper  So sweet and young  So sweet and young  They're good enough to eat  Baby raper  I'm a baby raper  I'm a baby raper

[01:43:00]  Has been dispatched  To look for Spaz  To the East River  To the East River  To try to look for Spaz  We're all hooping and praying  Of course Spaz didn't file  A flight plan  When he left the building  So we don't know  Exactly where he is  But it has been a warm  And a hazy day  The haze in his head  May contribute  To him missing now  Yeah  Uh  Brokaw  Yeah  Yes Opie

[01:45:30]  Just think  Think of  Those strippers  That were supposed to show up  For the show  Today  And not showing up  Think of them  As the iceberg  And the ship  The mighty ship  That was  Your career  On the  Opie and Anthony show  Struck that iceberg  And pour open your hull  Flooding all of your  Watertight compartments  But Spaz  Like Rose  And so many others  That clung to 
[01:46:00]  Wood and lifeboats  You must not  Give up  We're back  Spaz  You must come back  To the people  That love you  As Rose did  Spaz  Do you think  You are a failure  Do you think  You have let the boys down  You must be  A survivor  Please come back Spaz  Search out the studio

[01:48:00]  Just as people  Have been asked  Throughout the years  What were you doing  When Kennedy  Was assassinated  Do you remember  Where you were  When  When the man  Landed on the moon  You will remember  This day  In the future  Where were you  When Spaz  Disappeared  Spaz  Spaz

[01:49:30]  Whoa, spaz, you must be a survivor.  Okay, Anthony, now entering the 20th minute where no word from spaz, who you may recall walked 
[01:50:00]  off the O.P. and Anthony show onto the streets of Manhattan and disappeared because of Rick's  ranting in front of 30-some-odd people in the studio.  I believe spaz felt degraded.  That was his last, the report of his last emotional state was being very degraded.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  I have a special report.  We're turning this into a, no longer a search and rescue, but a recovery mission. 
[01:50:30]  Is that correct?  Thank you, Dave.  I don't know.  I'm going to go to line five.  Hold on a minute, all right?  All right.  All right.  There are reports, unconfirmed reports coming in that spaz has taken a hostage.  Hmm.  I don't know if that's true.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  This is Rob from EMS.  Yeah.  Listen, check this out.  Your show is spazzing people out.  This guy up in Uptown Manhattan, 303, 155, would say, Nick, he jumps out of the window,  second floor, people were like amazed, and he starts ranting and raving, and he runs 
[01:51:00]  back into the building.  He limped in.  They've got ESU and EMS on standby.  They're doing a floor-to-floor search, of course, starting with the roof.  Maybe they didn't realize what floor he was on.  But that's how your show was taken off, man.  All right.  Well, thank you.  All right.  I'll catch up to you guys soon.  So glad we cut off the Celine Dion bit for that.  Okay.  Terrific.  All right, Anthony.  Wow.  All the people saying maybe spazzing was abducted by the giant mosquito. 
[01:51:30]  The weather is turning a bit warmer.  Let's see.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I just saw spazzing face on the back of a milk carton.  Already?  Yeah.  It says, have you seen me lately?  The last 20 minutes.  Oh, man.  Things are getting bad.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  All right.  Well, hopefully.  Hopefully, spazze will call the radio show and all seriousness. 
[01:52:00]  We want to make sure he's okay.  All right?  Yes.  He had a tough little afternoon today.  Our buddy, our pal, our inspiration, spaz.  Yes.  Where do we stand with the girls and the sponging and stuff?  Chuck's in the pool.  Chuck's in the pool.  What?  Chuck's in the pool.  Ladies on the way, right?  Ladies are on the way.  Hey, one of the girls who want to be a lesbian for a day, too, Tanya, she called in.  I guess she was...  No, no, no.  She was one of the backups.  Is she coming in?  No, she got into a car accident.  Oh, and she's not coming in.  I hope it had nothing to do with spaz. 
[01:52:30]  She hits back.  All right.  Well, we'll definitely make this work, Anthony, okay?  Okay.  Also, voting for Bit of the Week, almost done.  Get your votes in for that.  And, Anthony?  Yeah.  Featuring all the offensive songs on the O&A show.  Oh, yeah.  This one is from Billy and Paul from airsick.net, as we encourage other people to send in their  most offensive songs for the Most Offensive Song Contest, okay?  Yeah.  What are you laughing at?  Just all the feedbacks and the fucking sauce spaz in a bar with Mike Adams. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Jesus, man.  That's pretty funny.  All right.  This one outraged a lot of people yesterday.  Let's play it again, and we'll be back.  I can't be a dad.  You bitch, I've been had.  Punch your stomach.  Thread pliers, they got stuck.  Your c** is bleeding. 
[01:53:30]  Hangers in your uterus.  Oh, stop your c** is.  I think I hooked the fever.  Want to kill the fetus?  I just want to yank it out of their c**s.  Please, D&C, suck out little toes and knees. 
[01:54:00]  Back, back yank.  Get me in the little boat's track.  Lose.  Kid juice.  Gonna pull it till it comes loose.  Fran is 84 years old.  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No, anal is okay.  Rainwreck Radio.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:54:30]  1027 WNEW.  What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day.  Never a dull moment on this damn radio show.  Hell no.  Come on, Spaz, give us a call.  I can't believe he hasn't called.  Even if he wants to just yell at us, we'll accept that today.  Just today.  But call the radio show.  Well, Smelly Karen's gonna leave soon.  Karen, are you kidding?  I'm not kidding.  I can leave for the 6th. 
[01:55:00]  No way.  I have to meet my aircraft at the Metropolitan Museum tonight.  What time does that start?  It starts at 6.  I was supposed to be there at 6.  What are you gonna...  I'm gonna be a little bit late, because they're gonna be...  Give me 10 minutes.  We wipe out.  We still have some of your artwork.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, this is art history.  This isn't drawing.  If I'm not in...  In your world, art should be history.  I'm sorry.  It was, you know...  No, it's cool. 
[01:55:30]  It's cool.  I'm learning, dude.  Karen, what you gotta do, you gotta do some kind of Giuliani art thing, and you'll be...  Yeah, like that guy, new artist, he did this Hitler thing, or Giuliani with some Nazis.  That's what we should do.  What?  What?  Let's just do some over-the-top Giuliani Nazi artwork or something.  And then we'll get some press.  Yeah.  Everybody will be talking about it.  Or press whores.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, why don't we get her in the kiddie pool?  All right.  Let's do that.  We got a couple of girls who are in a cab as we speak, and probably just a few blocks 
[01:56:00]  away.  A few blocks away.  From Privilege, Stella and Nikita.  All right.  Are you gonna yell at them when they get here, Rick?  Of course.  Yes, Anthony, that's what I do.  You know, so at the end of the day, when everything goes wrong, you guys will yell at me.  Come on.  Give me a break.  Come on.  Can we get her out there?  Let's go.  Let's get something going here.  Get those goddamn clothes off and get in the water. 
[01:56:30]  And hopefully, you know, hopefully the girls will show up and they'll, what'd you just say?  Thanks, Anthony.  I appreciate it.  You'll lose the clothes, honey.  Okay.  Hey, tell Rick to get us a microphone so we can go out there and check out the festivities.  Is this on the webcam, too?  Yes.  Yeah, I'm looking at the webcam right now.  Now, first thing, get goddamn Stinky and whoever the hell else is in the webcam camera  line of sight out of there.  All right.  I'll do that.  Here, Ben, get us a long microphone cord or something.  Tell us, Psycho Mark, to help us out, all right? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, because we've got to go out there.  Yeah, let's go to Ron real fast as they set this up.  Ron, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good today.  I just heard a report they didn't locate Spaz, but they were able to find his black box.  Very nice.  That's a good one.  Thank you, Ron.  Have a good weekend, guys.  You, too.  Another train wreck of a radio show, huh?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people concerned about Spaz, Anthony.  I see that. 
[01:57:30]  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys, I'm really concerned.  This guy, I'm in Jersey.  I'm looking for him.  I haven't found him yet.  No.  But you've got to look at the good thing.  Yeah.  I was able to get through.  He didn't hang up on me.  He usually does.  I've got to ask just one question.  Sure, go ahead.  Can I have his job?  Yeah, everyone already applying for his job.  We want Spaz back.  Guys, guys, I'll work for less money.  No, we want Spaz back.  No money?  He brings, he brings, uh...  Where's our Spaz?  I'm at you?  He brings too much good radio to our show. 
[01:58:00]  Where's our Spaz?  Where's our Spaz?  I can do that.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Spaz, come home.  All right.  Okay, guys, one last thing.  An FQ to Spaz.  He's really messing up.  All right, thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Come on, Spaz.  Call the radio show.  Call the radio show.  Ben, what's going on out there?  Is she getting naked finally?  Smelly Karen about to get sponged down?  No, she's in that suite.  She's in the what?  She's in the J-More suite getting ready.  Oh, she's in the J-More suite getting ready, okay?  J-More would be proud today. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, boy.  All right, Ed.  People, uh, some of the instant feedbacks I'm reading,  people, uh, just running the gamut of emotions  over the Spaz Tribunal.  Really?  Yeah.  What are they saying?  One guy pulling out of Burger King almost crashed.  He was, I guess the sorrow just got to him.  He says he was laughing real hard,  but you know how that nervous laughter gets you  in a time of tragedy?  Yeah.  I'm sure that's all it was,  but he said he was laughing so hard he almost crashed.  Coming out of Burger King. 
[01:59:00]  She's in the pool?  Yeah, in the pool.  Oh, let me see the, uh...  Wait, I don't think...  Say that again, Mark?  She's in the pool.  Oh, very nice.  Very, very good.  All right.  There she is.  Is she topless?  What's she wearing?  Hello.  Oh, there's Karen.  How are you, Karen?  I'm not touching...  I'm wet.  I don't want to touch the mic.  Is she naked?  That would be bad.  That would be good radio,  but that would be bad.  All right, so you're...  Are you sitting down in the pool, Karen?  I'm lying down in the pool, Opie.  All right, are you, uh...  Spin around so you're facing the camera.  No.  Why? 
[01:59:30]  Because...  No one could...  Oh, face the goddamn camera.  All right, here's part two of the saga.  Yeah.  Spaz had arranged it with Smelly Karen  that the Spaz cam would not be used,  but he never told any of us this.  What?  Karen, just, like, wet your hair.  No one will know it's you.  Yeah, right.  Just be a...  Uh-huh.  Just be a trooper.  Everyone on the website wants to check it out.  The other one in the pool.  No one will know it's me.  Oh, my God.  I know she's got big, huge boobas there. 
[02:00:00]  Come on.  You were showing those things on the camera.  What's she wearing?  Melons.  She's got a white...  She's got a one...  Uh, white piece.  A white one piece.  Oh, yeah?  Fine.  Fine.  Only for one either.  All right, you can hear the water.  Right here.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  All right, I'll get the mic outside.  Is this mic on?  Yes.  We're on the radio?  Yes.  All right, Ann, we got this microphone. 
[02:00:30]  We are next to the kiddie pool with, uh, Smelly Karen.  She's, uh, dressed in, like, a one-piece white bathing suit right now, Anthony.  Yes.  I see.  You can almost see through it as it gets wet up top.  But, uh, what are you doing in the pool with the bathing suit on?  Uh, because I have a bathing suit on.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Oh, she's waiting for the girl.  You're slowly and barely, you know.  Oh, is that it?  It builds up.  So the second the girls get here, then, uh...  Maybe. 
[02:01:00]  Things might happen.  We'll see.  Jesus Christ, you're standing around.  I don't know.  Standing around.  Look at Psycho Marks.  Psycho Marks pulling out his junk.  Here, splash the water so he gets that on the radio.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Can I dunk?  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Dunk under.  Jesus.  Yeah, there we go.  Was that a fart or was that the pool? 
[02:01:30]  Did anyone else hear that croak?  Did you fart or was that the pool?  No, it was me.  Oh, all right.  Well, someone...  Drop the soap in there.  Here, there's the soap.  All right, wash yourself up.  Start washing yourself up because, uh, the lesbians are on the way.  They want a nice, smelly, a fresh smell, a fresh smelling carrot, right, Anthony?  Right.  Yeah, yeah, because, uh...  Why was they going to scrub me out?  She's got to get that under on.  Get the pits really well.  Go ahead.  Wash up.  I'm afraid of the mic.  There we go.  I'm electrocuting me.  Oh, don't worry. 
[02:02:00]  I want electrocuting me.  Just show us your washing technique and we'll comment if you're doing it right or wrong.  Well, I usually, usually soap on my hands and...  Soap on your hands and then do that.  Do we have any kind of washcloths or something?  Is there something here?  Let me look.  Throw Spaz's t-shirt in there.  That's a towel so she could, like, dry herself off.  That's a snot rag.  She can't use that.  All right, she's, uh, she's taking care of her underarms right now, Anthony.  Yeah, I see.  She should have some kind of a loofah thing. 
[02:02:30]  Maybe some kind of exfoliating thing.  I don't know.  I don't think you're washing good enough.  I think that's your problem.  I don't see you really lathered up.  What's the difference between a shower and a bath?  I don't see you really lathered up.  Where's the soap?  She lost the soap already.  Right there.  See, she lost the soap.  Yeah.  I don't know how you could get all the vital areas that have to be washed wearing a bathing suit, for Christ's sake.  What about the, uh...  This isn't porno.  What about the thatch? 
[02:03:00]  That's why.  What about the thatch?  We don't know.  There's a fragrance coming out of that.  Play what's in your pants right now.  Use the mic, yeah.  Use this toaster.  Can you take...  Just pull the top down, because you've got to get, like, the smell, you know, from underneath the breasts and stuff.  There we go.  Yeah, you've got big boobs, so, like, under the boobs, almost acts like an extra two armpits.  All right.  She's got to hoist those things aloft, and there we go.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  Oh, the crowd of brood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  Okay.  Terrific.  All right.  Now this is getting a little better, Anthony.  Don't be bashful.  Soap them up.  I don't feel like a zoo animal.  No.  Soap them up.  Soap them up.  Soap them up.  It smells like a zoo animal.  No, thanks to you.  She's taking a bath in front of, what, like, 15 guys.  This is pretty sick.  All right, now...  Where are the other chicks?  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming, I hope.  Now, soap up underneath the boobs. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, lift them up.  I want to see if there's any, like, you know, sweat cheese under there or anything.  Oh!  Okay.  God damn, all.  That's disgusting.  They were nice and clean.  I've got to give her credit.  There you go.  All right, you've got to give them a lot of credit, they have.  There you go, Mike.  It is the way to get married.  Hey, take your clothes off and take a bath, Maggie.  All right, she's going under again.  Oh, look how buoyant her boobs are.  That was very nice.  Wait, do that again. 
[02:04:30]  All right, come on.  Don't get all shy.  Don't get shy.  She's getting all shy.  Get on your back, man.  It's like flotation devices.  Come on.  Let me see.  All the way on your back again.  Let's go.  Look at Pete.  Move your arms.  Move your legs.  Wow, look at that.  Wow.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  They come right to the surface, man.  They look like Ellen DeGeneres.  Wow, look at that.  They just bob around like a buoy.  All right, Ann, so far she has cleaned her underarms.  She's cleaned the cheese from underneath the breast.  The pool's making noises when she moves.  It's going. 
[02:05:00]  Do you clean between the breasts at all?  Yeah, I guess.  All right, time for cleansing of the ass crack.  Yeah.  Yeah, stand up and do the ass crack.  Yeah.  Stand up and do the ass crack.  Uh...  Gamma, you might have cranky ass, you know?  You don't want cranky ass.  You went through all the trouble of getting in the pool.  You can't have cranky ass.  I don't have cranky ass.  This is a radio first.  A girl taking a bath, a bubble bath, in the middle of the bathroom station. 
[02:05:30]  Why?  What?  Oh, Steve was trying to get an underwater shot.  Steve was trying to get an underwater shot, Anthony.  She's the most exposed, shy person I've ever seen.  What's she doing?  She's soaping up the hand.  I'm washing.  And now she's slipping a hand in a crack and washing.  And she's washing her...  Her...  Yeah, now get down the front of that thing.  All right, here she goes, Anthony.  Soaping up the hands.  There she goes.  She's playing What's in My Pants, but instead of using her phone, she's using the soap. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Scrub that thing good.  No, no, you need to scrub a little more than that.  Is that all you washed, that thing?  I might have found the problem there.  A red flag has just gone up.  We might have found the problem area.  A red flag?  You got to spend more than five seconds, a little more time down there.  More than five seconds on that area.  That's what they call an action area.  You got to keep...  You got to work a little extra.  There you go.  Okay.  Put the whole bar of soap down there. 
[02:06:30]  Keep it down there so you have a bulge in your pants.  Yeah.  I think she just found my high school class rank.  She's got...  When she leaves the bar of soap down there, it looks like Celine Dion.  All right.  All right.  She spent only...  She spent about 30 seconds down there.  Where are the girls?  I don't know.  What are you thinking?  Where are the girls?  Well, we got to wait for the other girls before she gets out.  Any comments from the peanut gallery?  Any comments?  Everyone liking it.  Everyone liking the technique of Karen's bubble bath. 
[02:07:00]  She's done the underarms, Ann.  She's done the...  She's under the boob.  She's done the crotch.  All right.  Now she's working her feet.  There's a film on the water.  Film on the water.  Oh, man.  It looks like an oil slick.  The Exxon...  It looks like where the Exxon Valdez went down.  Hey, we finally got the inappropriate bell, Ann.  Okay.  We got the bell out here.  All right.  Okay.  Drink it.  All right.  What do you got there, Rick? 
[02:07:30]  Some kind of shampoo?  This is a body wash.  Body wash.  Body wash.  Hey, there you go.  Some suave body wash.  Wait.  Yeah.  Oh, he's dripping her on it real slow.  All over, man.  Get her...  Here, lean over.  Lean over.  Oh, yeah, Rick.  Oh, my God.  Rick, you're...  You're so inappropriate, man.  Rick just put it down by his crotch and squeezed it, and it just came, like, flying out at her.  And hit her in the face.  All right, Rick.  Come on.  Jesus.  Rick, you're just wrong, man.  Oh, my God.  She's using the body wash, Ann. 
[02:08:00]  Now, she's...  Oh, she needs a chick to wash her back.  She needs someone to wash her back.  Oh, Anthony, the limo guy.  Very nice, Anthony.  Very nice.  I like this.  Maybe that could be the problem.  She can't reach, like, those hard-to-reach areas, Ann.  Yeah.  We're trying to figure out why she smells so bad when she's...  She's soaping up her legs now.  I shaved it.  I see you shaved.  That's very nice.  You shaved what?  Oh, your legs.  Okay.  Well...  Any hair care products?  Hair care products? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Maybe you could...  No, I should.  Razor and soap.  You want to wax yourself or something?  What else does she need to wash, guys?  We did all the areas it looks like.  Did she do the cranky ass?  We didn't see.  She wouldn't do anything.  Yeah.  I say she gets on her stomach and goes to the bar of soap on her ass.  You gotta...  We gotta make sure.  How can we judge if you're completely clean?  All right.  She's turning over, Anthony.  There we go.  Hey, that's a nice little ass there.  There you go.  There you go.  Okay. 
[02:09:00]  I believe I'm doing this.  Yeah, there you go.  Just get the soap.  Don't worry about it.  Get the soap.  Oh, okay.  Give yourself a wedgie.  We have another bar of soap.  That's all right.  That's all right.  Yeah, we have a couple of thousand bars of soap.  She's cleaning her food on it, Anthony.  She's getting the whole area.  Yeah.  All right.  See that?  No, that's what you need.  This is...  No, you're not...  You're almost there.  That's another action area.  You're not spending enough time.  No.  Did you wash the taint?  Yes.  In between... 
[02:09:30]  Okay, good.  You did.  You got that whole undercarriage.  Yeah, the bar of soap down there.  You know what?  It's like...  You ever look at a car or a truck?  What's the dirtiest area?  The undercarriage.  You got to clean it.  I feel like we're at a public pool, at the kiddie pool, watching one kid play.  I don't know what you do on the weekends there, right?  Hey, what other cleaning products do we have in the box?  Kid toucher.  Maybe it's her hair that smells so bad.  Hey, maybe it is.  I use suave strawberry. 
[02:10:00]  A little shampoo?  Yeah, get her to her upper head.  All right.  Because it depends.  Well, she's using the shampoo.  She's got to keep her eyes closed, and we can all cop feels.  She won't know who it is.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  She's picking out her shampoo of choice.  Her favorite hair care product, perhaps.  The best part is the boobs that float on the top of the water.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  Me too.  All right.  Suddenly, no one cares that Spaz is missing. 
[02:10:30]  Spaz Hill.  All right.  I guess she's picking out a shampoo.  A shampoo.  Rick, let her apply her own shampoo.  Don't thrust it into her face.  If you're tuning in, we're watching her girl bathe.  Well, she does.  She's using a lot of shampoo.  A lot of people freak it out on the Internet, because we do have the webcam.  Yeah.  Checking out this whole mess.  There she goes.  She's lathering up her head, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Getting a nice head of suds there. 
[02:11:00]  Look at that.  You got to eat the scalp, man.  Yes, you got to rub the scalp.  Of course.  Very good.  That's nice.  I think she's getting clean, Opie.  Yeah.  If you stink after this, it's a lost cause.  A lost cause.  She's pretty much clean everything.  She's going to now rinse her head in the soapy water.  Rinse in her head.  She's going down.  There she goes.  Oh, nice.  But she's not.  There we go.  Now she's getting her hands into it. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Psycho Mark is precariously dangling the mic of inches above the water.  We have like a boom mic set up.  Oops.  A boom mic.  Look, there it is.  The shot that we like.  She's laying on her back, and her boobs are kind of floating.  Floating above water.  The nipples are above water.  This was no boating accident.  Well, I don't know what else to do.  I think she's clean herself.  Oh, conditioner.  Oh, conditioner.  She has to condition, Opie. 
[02:12:00]  She's got a milk fist.  This is a radio first.  So the other girls come here.  A girl taking a bubble bath.  Taking a bath.  She's completely bathing.  In the kiddie pool.  There she goes.  A little conditioning.  You don't condition the thatch?  I may have a cone.  Hey, do you condition the thatch?  Do I condition it?  No.  Down below?  Really?  You don't do that?  She has a wood floor, Anthony.  She needs polish.  You do?  Yeah.  You have wood floor?  I was going to play What's in My Pants, but you guys didn't want it. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, we don't believe you.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  Leave it.  Yeah, give us a side shot.  A side shot?  Come on.  A side shot of the wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Does anybody have a cone?  Wood floor.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Okay, she said all right.  All right, she needs a cone.  She needs a cone.  Why does it come?  Still to come on the radio show, by the way, a bit of the week, Anthony.  Yeah.  After this mess.  This could be it. 
[02:13:00]  The haunting tribute to Spence.  All right.  Here we go, Anthony.  All right.  The money's gone.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Whoa.  Wait, I can't see.  Pull it aside more.  No.  I didn't see anything.  I saw.  I saw, like, upper thigh.  I saw.  It looked like a hatchet one.  No.  Whoa, two more.  Ah.  Yeah.  The girl's from Privilege.  Just in time.  Just in time.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[02:13:30]  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  She couldn't wash her back.  She couldn't wash her back because she didn't have any help.  Let her get in real fast before you leave.  Yeah.  And then she could help you wash your back.  All right.  All right.  Get the body wash or something.  And I'll tell you something.  No goddamn bathing suit or bottoms or anything.  There's got to be full nudity in this pool, for Christ's sake.  All right. 
[02:14:00]  The girls are getting undressed from Privilege, Anthony.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Smokey, man.  All right.  Well, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to speak English.  And you can miss one of both.  You don't ruin it yet.  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about the class.  I'm talking about my significant other.  Get the horse down.  Who doesn't know that I'm doing it now?  All right.  The girls are just about ready to join Smelly Karen, who's not that smelly anymore.  Now she's Soapy Karen.  Soapy Karen. 
[02:14:30]  Psycho Mark adding that she's almost...  Whoa!  That she's almost bangable, and she just splashed Psycho Mark.  All right.  Be careful.  Who is the guy holding the mic over the pool?  You're crazy.  You will get electrocuted.  All right.  The girls...  We're ready.  Jump in there.  In the bathroom.  In the bathroom.  We're live on the radio.  Tell her to just pee in the pool.  All of us did.  All right.  Don't be shy.  Come on.  All right. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  Wow.  All right.  Here come the girls.  Wow.  They are smoking.  Make sure you get that on the webcam, man.  We have any tunes or anything?  We can...  Where's the boombox?  That's all right.  The girls...  Oh, my God.  Hello.  We got to thank Laszlo from Privilege for helping us in a bind, man.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Is the water warm?  Yeah.  It's good.  Yeah?  All right.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  It's topless.  All right.  The...  The...  Thank you.  Huh?  No?  Because she's been washed?  The tripper from Privilege is soaping up Karen really nice right now.  The other girl has entered the kiddie pool with the body wash and they're both topless.  They are...  They are...  They're applying the soap in a very unusual way.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Oh, look.  Now Karen getting involved.  And they're using their boobs to spread out the soap and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who do we have?  Introduce each other.  That's Karen. 
[02:16:00]  That's...  Stella.  Stella.  And Nikita.  Nikita, yeah.  Nikita, our favorite.  She's always here.  Nikita brought her own flotation device.  Just in case, you know, the water gets too deep.  All right.  They're...  All right.  They're all soaping up.  What are we?  Swimmies.  Hey, who's got the digital camera?  All right.  Rick's taking some pictures.  Wow.  Look at that.  So we can show you guys later on.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now there's washing going on.  Okay. 
[02:16:30]  Terrific.  Wow.  They are making sure all the areas we discussed earlier are definitely clean.  Yeah.  Ladies, maybe you want to get the underside of her boobs.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Yeah, maybe stand up.  There you go.  Ladies.  All right.  And now washing her legs.  Wow.  Look at that.  Oh, she's using not only her hands, but the cleavage makes a great little washcloth.  Oh, no.  Oh, you got my eye. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, watch it.  Oops.  Sorry about that.  That was psycho Mark, and that wasn't cream rinse.  Mark's playing pool boy right now with the towel.  Oh, well.  It's very slippery, isn't it, ladies?  All three girls getting very friendly with each other at this point, Anthony.  Yeah, make sure you wash her cranky ass.  She might have cranky ass. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, they're washing her cranky ass.  Get in there.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  Oh, the giggling going on in the pool.  You know, I forgot to take a bath today, Karen.  Oh, you did?  It's all right.  Well, Karen.  Well, look, now you're getting all cleaned up.  Wash her up.  Come on.  I'm going to wash each other up.  People.  Yeah.  Anthony, listeners are just going nuts.  The webcam is on.  Yes, in full force.  We're finding some great pictures right now.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, Karen.  What do you think about touching other girls' soapy bodies? 
[02:18:00]  You like it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, she's digging this.  It's been a long time.  It's been a long time.  Very long time.  That's something.  Look at that.  That whole thing of body wash is almost gone at this point.  They're just going all over.  I got more.  Hey, Stella.  You haven't been washed yet?  No, I haven't.  Go wash her up, man.  There they are.  The girls.  Get her all over.  There you go. 
[02:18:30]  Here, you can waste that bottle of body cleaner.  Just spray it.  Just get it all over the place.  Wash all around her.  There we go.  Wash all around the G-strings because they shoved those dollars in there, and you don't know  where the hell those things have been.  So you want to clean that whole area.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, you don't want anything getting infected.  A paper cut.  Cut.  Cut.  Wow.  These girls are getting all soapy.  Oh, look at this move.  She takes a body wash and just gets it all over her boobage. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, wow.  Very nice.  Applying everything at this point.  You know what we ought to do?  Huh?  We ought to bottle up this water and sell it on eBay.  What are we, stupid?  Let's do that.  Let's do it.  We'll bring it to our next room.  We'll give out water from the bath.  Yeah, we'll have like ten bottles of water from the lesbian bath.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's very warm in here.  Are you sure you guys don't want to jump in? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, that'll offer.  Jesus Christ.  Look at that.  I love it.  Yeah, well, that'll end up in a court case.  If we're still on the air, the answer would have to be no, of course.  Wow.  Yeah, the one girl's really getting into it.  You're getting all washed up.  She's got the two girls working her and soaping her up and cleaning her.  Okay, all of a sudden there's kissing going on.  Yeah, there's like all kinds.  Karen is like, Karen is really getting turned on by this. 
[02:20:00]  What is she doing?  I don't know.  Going down.  It looks like she was bobbing for apples.  Yeah, what are you bobbing for?  It's just too much soap.  It's just too much soap?  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, Karen, I don't think, have they seen your wood floor?  No, I haven't seen my wood floor.  Hey, she's got wood floor.  You know what that is?  You don't know wood floor?  She's shaped down completely. 
[02:20:30]  And she doesn't even know English.  Yeah, I know.  What am I talking to?  Jesus.  She knows lap, dance.  Oh, look at this.  There you go.  Wow, now we're getting into some serious grand finale action here, Anthony.  They're both sitting, facing each other, legs interlocked.  Oh, okay.  Now Karen is, there's just a massive lesbian scene going on right now.  We're going to send this into HBO for the next version of If These Walls Could Talk. 
[02:21:00]  There we go.  Wow, yeah.  That's nice.  Screw that Ellen DeGeneres Sharon Stone crap, man.  We got the real stuff right here.  Whoa!  Man, she is going to town.  Of course, we're taking plenty of video and pictures.  Taste a little soapy.  Rinse them off before you put them in your mouth.  Right.  What are you doing?  There you go.  You got a little bit of water. 
[02:21:30]  You got to see this scene, man.  A huge kiddie pool.  Hey, can one of you girls stick your nose in her armpits to make sure she's clean, for God's sake?  Yeah, they're pretty clean by now.  Give it a spell.  Oh, yeah.  She's clean.  She's clean, huh?  Okay.  Yeah, good.  These armpits are clean.  They're now like, yeah.  A lot of rubbing.  A lot of scrubbing.  A lot of touching.  A lot of touching.  Now they're really getting, I think, I think they know each other a little better now.  Karen is really into this, man. 
[02:22:00]  She is.  She forgot all about art, Vlad.  Yeah, exactly.  I got an art exhibit in my pants.  Yeah, I'm on today, Chuck.  Oh, they are amazing.  Whoa, look at this.  A little kissage going on.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  There you go. 
[02:22:30]  A little scrubbing.  Okay, terrific.  The hands and mouths coming into play as they, yeah, watch you don't lean on the back of that  too hard.  This pool is about ready to break.  One of the girls leaned on the side of the pool and the water almost came out very close  that time.  Oh, my God.  Take it on water.  You must be a survivor.  Almost flooded all the watertight compartments.  I'll tell you what.  I don't think Karen's got a watertight compartment right now. 
[02:23:00]  Hells no.  Yeah, just watch that.  Yeah, I don't even know what else to say yet.  This is just one of the best lesbian scenes I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, you just don't want it to stop, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, there's a lot more rubbish.  You know what it is?  As it goes on, they're getting more and more intimate with each other.  We have brought lesbian for a day to the next level.  I do believe that. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, Karen.  There's some deep kissing.  Karen is, like, totally into chicks.  Look at her.  Karen, who's your best pal at this point?  Come on.  Don't be an Anthony.  Yeah, see?  We ragged you a little bit.  But look, we cleaned you up and we got you two chicks.  Another lesbian fantasy coming true, Anthony.  Wonderful.  All right.  All right, ladies.  Well, we got a fantastic job.  We got to thank Smelly, Karen, Stella, and Nikita, right?  Nikita from Privilege.  Two really smoking babes. 
[02:24:00]  Go see them at Privilege downtown.  Right, Ant?  Yeah.  Good job.  All right, ladies.  Very careful coming out of the pool.  Yeah.  There's no lifeguard on duty.  They all have boners.  Next.  Yeah.  We'll do a bit of the week next.  Stay there.  Hello.  Hello.  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence to this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Hopefully you have that for me. 
[02:24:30]  Hello.  That's the stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  And I thought we were all just having fun.  See you on the show.  Is someone archiving those pictures off of the webcam so we can maybe put them on the unofficial site?  You can download like that.  You ever see that?  You download an entire half hour or hour at a time.  Of all the pictures of people that weren't able to see it?  That would be nice.  Well, just when you thought you've lost faith in your buddies, O.P. and Anthony, we pulled another one out of our thoughts today. 
[02:25:00]  Even without spaz.  We've got to thank the fine ladies from Privilege for stopping on by and saving our bit today.  Jumping into the little kiddie pool with the smelly Karen.  Scrubbing her down.  Wow.  Ladies.  Wonderful.  Yeah, we've got to thank the ladies before they leave.  Stella and Nikita from Privilege.  Good job.  How do you feel?  Did you guys have fun?  You feel all nice and clean now?  Yeah.  Squeaky clean. 
[02:25:30]  Squeaky clean?  Stella's the coat check.  Stella's the coat check.  Oh, that's okay.  Because we were down there.  I was trying to remember if I saw you naked or not before.  I have a crisis for you guys.  I have nothing to do with them now since they're all wet.  All right.  Your wet panties.  Oh, we'll save those too.  We'll save those.  We'll throw them out to the crowd during the next road show, Anthony.  Well, maybe we'll give them to Rosie O'Donnell and she could auction them off for charity.  On eBay.  Yeah.  We should start our own O&A eBay.  O&A eBay.  eBay charity.  Just all the disgusting, debaucherous crap we have on this show. 
[02:26:00]  We're bottling the water, Anthony.  Yeah, we're going to save some of the pool water for the next appearance.  And we're going to give that away.  Autographed bottles of the pool water.  Of the lesbian bath.  Well, Karen, how are you feeling now?  Come on, Karen.  And you've got to like us now, even though we said you were stinky, right?  I feel pretty good.  Let me tell you something.  She's sitting right here.  Oh, like a couple of feet away from me.  Yeah.  I am smelling soap and clean shampoo and conditioning. 
[02:26:30]  You smell very good.  And can't take your word for it.  Where's stinky?  Stinky, get in here.  Stinky was the one who smelled Karen's armpits.  Let's see if they're clean now.  Stinky?  Yep.  You have to smell her armpits now to see where we stand.  Let me get it.  Yeah, lift that up.  There you go.  Okay.  It was the left arm that was the problem area.  It's very flowery fresh.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  It is now clean Karen. 
[02:27:00]  Woo!  Not smelly Karen.  Clean Karen.  All right.  The artist formerly known as Stinky Karen.  Lesbian Karen.  Oh, looks like, yeah, she'd be lesbian Karen.  Jesus Christ.  You were going to town in there.  She had two handfuls and mouthfuls, and she's going to town.  Well, it's definitely a new meaning to, you know, wash your mouth out with soap.  Yeah.  See?  You're dirty.  She's got a soapy mouth.  Even though you just came out of the bath, you are a dirty girl.  Yes, you are.  I think she was brushing her teeth with a fart of Nikita. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, I know.  No.  No.  All right.  I got to check it out.  All right.  Well, let's hear it for smelly Karen.  Karen.  Formally.  Smelly Karen.  Formally.  Smelly Karen.  Lean as a whistle, Karen.  Very good.  And you really enjoy the whole girl thing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, ladies.  Ladies out there, if there's a lesbian fantasy we can make come true for you, just get a hold  of the radio show, okay?  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah, that's right. 
[02:28:00]  All right, Karen.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks.  There goes Karen.  All right.  Karen.  In the studio.  She'll be at our class in about 10 minutes.  She'll go to our art class and all of the students will go, you smell so good.  See?  And I guess we got to thank the ladies from Privilege.  But your clothes still stink.  I'm kidding, Karen.  I'm kidding.  And let's hear it for Stella.  Yes.  And Nikita from Privilege.  West 23rd Street on the corner of 11th Avenue. 
[02:28:30]  Great little place down there.  Yes.  Check it out.  Say hi to Laszlo for us and the girls, Stella and Nikita.  All right?  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you, ladies, for helping us out today.  We appreciate it.  Nice to meet you.  Between 5 and 8, free admission and buffet.  They want us to mention, Anthony.  Buffet.  Proper attire.  It's a gentleman's club.  Privilege.  All right?  Proper attire.  You can't go there with your schlong hanging out.  I don't like this one.  Oh, man.  Yeah, tell them who you are or they'll throw you out.  Let's get dressed like that, you slob.  And the phone's just going nuts here. 
[02:29:00]  What radio show shares with their listeners?  Well, that's just it.  I'm reading the instant feedback, which is coming in at a rate I haven't seen in quite some time.  And people are saying this is the best thing.  I mean, we are giving people, somebody said, the best radio they've ever seen.  Seen?  Now, what is that?  Well, we try to share with you guys.  So they punched up the cam and saw three girls naked in a kiddie pool, washing each other, and then caressing.  The best bubble bath I've ever seen in my life. 
[02:29:30]  That was pretty good.  You know what's funny?  Me and Hope, we're standing outside.  We're, you know, trying to give a play-by-play.  Thank God we have the webcam so people can check it out.  But after a while, you realize when something has run its course, you know, we didn't want to stop.  No.  It was like, okay, you know, as far as the radio show goes, we did it.  It's good.  It was a rousing success.  Sure.  But let's keep going for ten more minutes.  Yeah, because I really don't want to stop.  Because the secret of radio, when you're in one of these, you know, things where you have lesbians going at it in a kiddie pool and it's sudsy and soapy and stuff, 
[02:30:00]  the girls will continue until you turn the mics off.  Yeah.  As soon as the mics go off, they are done.  Yeah.  Don't kid yourself.  They're not here, you know, trying to turn us on.  They're here for the exposure and the fame of the whole thing.  So you probably heard a few, okay, they're scrubbing.  Right.  Yes.  So we were delaying knowing as soon as we turned off the mics, they were done.  But a good thing we did delay because toward the end, they really started getting more friendly. 
[02:30:30]  God.  It was a little weird when they first got in the pool, the two girls, with Karen.  They had to loosen up a little bit.  Yeah.  And then once they loosened up, Karen loosened right up, didn't she?  Oh, my God.  Steve, what's going on?  How did that leave her 2,000 pace?  Your timing, terrible.  Big F you to Spaz because I was on that webcam from like 3 o'clock on, trying to catch it.  Now I had to go pick up my girlfriend.  I got screwed.  Spaz screwed you, Steve.  You ain't kidding. 
[02:31:00]  You ain't kidding.  I swear to God, one day I will pay this man back.  We just crashed the NAW website, by the way.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  It's back and running now, but it just was getting pounded by our listeners.  It took a lot of hits.  It took a lot of hits.  That's okay because there will be video and stuff on the official website.  It is the ultimate, bro.  That is the best radio, exactly, the best radio that we've ever seen.  It's great.  Well, we try to share with you guys a little different than how the other guys did it in this town.  Yo, tell Karen, yo, she's pretty cute. 
[02:31:30]  Not bad, man.  I sent in a feedback.  Cool.  Yo, guys, thanks a lot, man.  Have a good one.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  All right, let's go to John.  Hello.  John, you're next on WNEW.  Guys, that ruled, man.  Yeah, that was something, huh?  That was phenomenal.  We had that on at work, and there's a girl there that is so hot for this thing.  She wants to come in next week.  Oh, really?  Let me tell you, man.  I'll tell you guys, we could have bailed you out.  Because right at the time, you were missing out on the girls. 
[02:32:00]  We were trying to get through, and Spaz hung up on me.  Yeah, well, we're going to make a lot of ladies' fantasies come true on this radio show.  We're taking the whole lesbian for a day thing to the next level, so.  Well, that was beyond the next level, my friend.  All right, John.  Thank you.  We'll call you next week.  We'll get her over there.  All right, cool.  I've got to talk to John here.  I mean, Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Good.  What's up?  All right, I've got to hand it to you guys.  You guys finally have exercised all the gayness that Jay Moore brought in. 
[02:32:30]  I think you're right.  That deserves a little clap.  I think it's done.  Yeah.  I don't think there was anything gay about that whole thing.  It was like a little demon hanging out.  You probably got rid of it.  I do believe you're right.  There was a danger today that we were going to have Spaz and Stinky in the pool.  That would have taken a lot to get out of that one.  Yeah, all right.  Thank you, Joe.  Take care.  Take care, guys.  All right, let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, you're next on the radio show.  What's up?  Yeah, listen, I want to start the bidding for that bathwater, that $500. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, we're going to bottle up the bathwater.  We got a pair of panties from one of the girls.  That's awesome, man.  Oh.  I love my swag.  What?  Wow, okay, very good.  Yeah, keep all this stuff.  Well, at least they're clean, I think.  We really got to put some of this stuff on eBay.  We've got to have an eBay auction.  That's a smart dancer, by the way, because look at the color of our panties.  You can't tell if there's a skid mark. 
[02:33:30]  They're brown.  Yeah, they're like kind of a brownish, dark, dark, burgundy brown thing.  Good for the front and the back.  Hey, Chuck, Chuck, put them on.  You'll look naked.  Oh.  I am outraged.  You'll look like a G.I. Joe doll.  I hate it when you're on.  I'm on like once every like five weeks. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, the traffic on the spaz cam was ridiculous.  A lot of people bumming.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You guys rule.  Cool.  I just want to send a big FU out to everybody on the van wick that held me up from getting home and watching the spaz cam.  Yeah.  Man, that sucked.  I got home yesterday early.  All I watched was your head open.  Oh, really?  I know.  We don't want the camera on Aunt and I anymore. 
[02:34:30]  It's got to be on like the girls that come in here.  Yeah, we'll do it when we have something fun going on in here.  So, all right, Joe.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You guys rule.  Thank you.  Finication now.  All right.  Bye.  Kevin.  Yo.  How are you?  All right, man.  Good.  O&A?  Yeah.  Hey, listen, man.  Instead of lesbian for a day, you can have lesbian baptisms and you can do the whole Moses bit and all.  Praise Jesus.  Praise Jesus.  Hallelujah.  Very good.  All right, man.  Thank you, Kevin.  You guys suck, man.  All right.  Well, it was a huge success, Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  Yes.  A little bubble bath with Karen.  That was good, yeah, because it turned into lesbian for a day.  Yep.  Lesbian fantasy for a day.  Yes.  All right, and we're going to do a bit of the week next, finally.  Running a little late.  We'll do it in a few minutes here.  All right.  And as we go to commercial, what's up, Rick?  We've got to thank Big Cam for bringing the pool.  Yes.  Yeah.  Bravo.  Thank you.  And he was also holding the spaz cam as he walked around the...  Yeah.  Good job. 
[02:35:30]  Your directorial debut.  Very, very nice.  He had the most important job on the radio show today.  He did.  Holding the webcam still.  And he did a good job.  He was moving, kept the action in frame.  Mm-hmm.  Good job.  Very good.  And he also blew up the pool.  Yeah.  Which was a hell of a job, too.  All right.  With that, Ann, we've got to take a break.  Bit of the week next.  And also, another thing we've been doing on the show all day is playing some of the offensive  songs that you hear on the O&A show.  Yeah, our contest, the most offensive song ever written. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, we'll be playing some more of those.  Well, this is a popular one.  Oh, you're playing it now?  Yeah, from the Stephen Lynch catalog, Anthony.  Cool.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF.  And if you love a good cage match, you're going to love Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail to the kings of the radio.  1027 WNEW. 
[02:36:30]  Wow.  Almost done, Anthony.  I'm going to go see Louis Black this weekend, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Louis was in yesterday from Comedy Central's Daily Show.  Does Back in Black.  He's playing the Stress Factory in East Brunswick, New Jersey, right?  Yes.  I highly recommend you go see him.  He's got two shows tonight, 8.30 and 11.  And tomorrow night, same thing, 8.30 and 11.  I'm going to get my ass out and finally see him this weekend.  Got to.  Cool, eh?  Because I hear nothing but great things about his stand-up act, Dan, and he's a friend of the show. 
[02:37:00]  So, by the way, Louis, if you're listening, hold four.  I need four.  I need four.  I might even make a trip down to Paisano this weekend to find out.  Oh, look at you making the rounds.  Goodwill, ambassador.  Trying.  It's about time.  Yeah.  Feeling good about the radio show.  Got to go out and celebrate a little bit.  Okay, terrific.  All right, this is what we've got left, Ant.  Yeah.  We've got to do Bit of the Week here.  Yes.  And right after Bit of the Week, we're going to play What Did We Learn on the Ophi and Anthony Show today. 
[02:37:30]  That could be a good round today.  I think people learned a lot today.  Yeah, I do believe so.  So, let's do it, Ant.  It was a runaway victory here for Bit of the Week.  Dice finally making it back into the studio this week.  Yeah, Dice taking a little vacay from the show for a while.  Since he was in here live, I think.  Yeah.  And, oh, geez, he just happened to turn up.  And he came back strong this week.  Here it is.  Bit of the Week on the Ophi and Anthony Show. 
[02:38:00]  Ophi and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't speak to.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  B and Anthony.  There, in my day, radio was boring all the time.  And we liked it that way.  And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath.  Oh, we had a bath.  We had a bath today.  Right, Anthony?  Yes.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[02:38:30]  The O&A Show.  We're back live.  Ah, there it is.  Nice bit of the week on this fine Friday.  March 10th, 2000.  We have bottled up some of the water for the lesbian bath.  How do it smell?  That's good.  Yeah, all soapy and ice.  Smells like clean lesbians.  Yes.  Beautiful.  And we're going to hand those bottles of water out at our next road show.  You know what we've got to do?  We've got to get, like, nice jars.  So we can fill up a bunch of jars with that water. 
[02:39:00]  Looks all nice, all sealed.  And sign them up.  Have the lesbians maybe even sign it.  And then give it out.  What a prize that would be.  Imagine that up on your mantelpiece at home.  We should do that.  We'll work on that next week.  Right next to the picture of Grandma.  Yeah.  All right, it's time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  I think it was an educational show.  Well, we have so many people checking in from the instant feedback game.  Let me read a few of these really fast. 
[02:39:30]  Smart guy from the island.  Today I learned three sets of boobs and a kiddie pool is better than one.  Rich from Mount Kisco.  What I learned today is that you will drive home from work really, really fast when you know naked women in a pool are on the spaz cam on your computer at home.  Today I learned that this is smart guy from the island.  Today I learned that any W needs a new server, more bandwidth, and a 30 FPS high-resolution webcam.  F you, F me, F us all, because God damn, we're a bunch of lucky son of bitches.  Well, let me tell you, we are definitely at the infancy stage of the webcam. 
[02:40:00]  Don't worry about it.  We're checking it out.  I think it's a rousing success.  Yes, it was huge.  But we could use a better camera, to be the truth.  Ben from Garfield.  Well, I've learned that three girls in a pool make for a woody in your pants the size of the Washington Monument.  Pasha from Brooklyn.  What I learned on the O&A show today.  Recipe for hot lesbo action as prepared by Julia Childs equals one smelly big-boobed woman with no sense of smell, 
[02:40:30]  plus two strippers who can't speak English, plus a kiddie pool all mixed in with some marinara.  Also, there's nothing more addictive than a catchy tune about raping children.  Jesus.  The soul of nigger Charlie.  No, the soul of nigger Joe checking in from the projects.  The soul of nigger Joe?  I learned that Anthony's better than Dice.  Dan from Jersey.  I learned that Spaz is ready to go postal.  Yeah, hopefully he'll check in on Monday to see what the hell's going on. 
[02:41:00]  He hasn't even called.  I hope he doesn't.  Wow, relax.  That's something.  I thought he would have called, you know?  We'll get to the bottom of it on Monday.  I guess so.  All right, let's go to the phones and play what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today.  Let's start with Billy from airsick.net.  Billy!  Oh, there he is.  Great radio, dude.  Hey, what's up, Billy?  Hey, look, I've got a name for the bottle of lesbian water.  All right.  Trey Gash. 
[02:41:30]  Trey Gash.  That's very nice.  It's a bottle of Trey Gash.  We're going to get fancy labels and stuff, Billy.  Oh, that's real purdy.  You got like the genie bottles, yeah?  Yeah, we got like nice bottles, maybe even a little spray top so you could have a little  Trey Gash with you at all times.  And walk into it, you know?  A little spray in your crotch before you go to that important meeting.  We're taking this serious.  We're going to bottle the water all nice, and we're going to give them away.  By the way, accept no imitations by imposter selling other bottled water on eBay. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  We got the original here in the studio.  Have a great weekend, guys.  All right, Billy.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's see.  The phones are not.  There we go.  Hey, Jim, what's going on?  What did you learn on the show today?  I'm on?  Yeah, what's up?  Okay.  I learned that you guys rule the airwaves of the whole world, let alone New York.  Oh, look at that.  And I got to F you to you guys because today at school, I was humming Baby Raper and almost 
[02:42:30]  got friggin' suspended.  Yeah, that song is going to be hummed by a lot of people this weekend.  Humming is one thing.  When you're singing the words, like in the supermarket, if you're there in produce, wheeling  your little cart, and you're like, Baby Raper, I'm a baby raper.  Yeah, and then I get to line the Swedish chariots at the Disney store, and I kind of want  to watch it after me.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Hey, guys, can you play it one more time?  It's going to be the weekend now.  Ah, no, I think we'll...  Please?  No.  We'll wait.  We have a tendency of, you know, playing our bits to death, so... 
[02:43:00]  You're going to put them on the website.  Yeah, yeah, they should be up, right, Steve?  Steve from the unofficial O.P. Anthony website here in the studio today, documenting the lesbian  bath.  Oh, yes.  Ryan from Westchester.  All right, Jim.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  Oh, Jesus.  And the Wrangler.  And the Wrangler.  Thank you.  Ryan from Westchester.  God, Spaz is like Gilligan.  He screws up big time, runs away, and has all the castaways looking for him all over  the island.  Spaz, Spaz, little buddy. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, it is.  It's like a Gilligan.  All right.  Let's get a...  Kevin.  Kevin, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned today that I got to kill my wife, and our divorce, she took the computer, and  I missed the whole episode today.  Ah.  You weren't one of the lucky ones that was able to get into the webcam.  No, actually, I was driving around doing estimates all day for my landscape company,  and I'm listening to you guys all day, peeing in my pants, man.  It was hilarious.  You didn't learn something from an earlier O.P. and Anthony show.  Yes, I did.  I actually called up and said, F you to her on the air. 
[02:44:00]  You guys let me say that to her on the air.  But if you have your computer over her house, you have to break through the back.  Back door and take it.  No, well, she's living out of her parents now.  She left me home with our house in Montevideo, New Jersey, and now I'm sick of me living at  home by myself.  So you've got to send some of those broads over, too.  All right.  Thank you.  Peace out, guys, man.  Great show.  Peace out.  Peace out.  Peace out.  Tony, on the instant feedback from Jersey, I learned that I need to get me some lesbians 
[02:44:30]  in my bathtub.  And let's go to line eight.  Who's this?  Spaz.  Hey, Spaz.  What's up?  How you doing, guys?  I'm really sorry, guys.  I don't understand.  Rick just really upset me.  I had to run out.  I extend my sincerest apologies to you.  Can you forgive me? 
[02:45:00]  Please forgive me.  That's pretty good, man.  Cranky spaz.  A fake spaz on the line.  Who's this?  You've got to give your real name.  We want to give you credit, pal.  It's Joe, man.  Joe, good job.  That was a good fake spaz.  Have a great weekend.  Syndication out, guys.  All right, man.  Just shake it easy.  That was good, man.  I think we've done it all today, Anthony.  We should step aside.  Got to thank Rick for pulling this out for us today. 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  Is this true?  Spaz was spotted down the LIE with Al Cowlings and a white Bronco?  Is that true?  I got Spaz in the back.  I got Spaz.  I swear.  I got him in the back.  He's got a gun.  I want to thank Steve from the unofficial Opian Anthony website.  Yes.  We're documenting the whole damn thing.  Not a problem.  Steve, how long is this going to take before you get some of this up for the people that  weren't lucky to get on the webcam?  By tomorrow, I should have some clips. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, look at that, Anthony.  Look at that.  Call 911.  Call 911.  I want to thank Anthony.  You want to give a plug for your place today?  I'm feeling in a good mood.  Go ahead.  You're in a good mood today?  Plug away.  Op-Nash Limousine.  Call me for your proms.  All right.  Very good.  How are they going to call you?  What?  To use your limo services as a date?  516-756-1663.  All right.  And I think there's a link on the unofficial website.  Let's take one more.  What did we learn? 
[02:46:30]  Sal, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  How are you, Sal?  All right.  Yo, today I learned warm water cools faster than cool water.  Yeah.  That was physics professor Spaz before his outburst.  Yeah, very good.  Good job, Sal.  All right, bro.  Later.  With that, we've got to get the hell out of here.  Yeah.  We'll see some of you guys at the Louis Black Show this weekend.  Cool, man.  Stress Factory, East Brunswick.  Two shows tonight, 830 and 11, and tomorrow, 830 and 11.  All right?  Rock. 
[02:47:00]  What a week.  What a week.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for listening.  We definitely appreciate you guys.  You know that by now.  And have a great weekend.  We'll see you all Monday at 2, right?  Mm-hmm.  All right, man.  Come and listen to a story about O and A.  They say they like women, but they sound sort of gay.  When you hear more of a guest named Jay, pull out the mug, get ready to spray.  Hawaii, that is.  The Virgin Islands.  Guam.  Out of control is what the boss used to say. 
[02:47:30]  Now they got a new boss that lets them play.  What's in my pants could be the game today.  Mohawk Triangle Hitler's face.  Now it's time to say goodbye to O and A and friends.  They would like to thank you folks for kindly calling in.  You're all invited back tomorrow, 2 to 7 p.m.  You never know, but bonus show could possibly extend.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[02:48:00]  2-0-2-3-4.  1-0-1-3.  2-0-2-5.  1-0-2-4.  1-0-2-4.  2-0.  1-2-8.  1-0. </pre>
