<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with bizarre, unrelated audio followed by the hosts' characteristic vulgar banter.  A significant portion focused on a prank where they falsely announced Jim Norton’s arrest for soliciting a transsexual prostitute.  The hosts played numerous voicemails from Norton’s distraught family and friends reacting to the fabricated story.  Anthony recounted his weekend, including online poker and a Star Trek marathon, and shared stories about "No-Filter Paul," a listener who performed a humiliating laxative-and-diaper stunt (video on YouTube), and the attractiveness of Paul's stepdaughters.  A sports discussion followed, covering the Dallas Cowboys' win, the Philadelphia Eagles' loss, and the hosts' football prediction contest.  They also debated David Blaine's upcoming gyroscope stunt, returning to the Norton prank and its fallout, and promoted an upcoming eggnog challenge.

The show continued with a discussion of the Judith Regan/O.J. Simpson interview, debating its ethics and comparing it to other controversial interviews (Hitler, the Iceman, Saddam Hussein, Bin Laden).  The hosts criticized the media's perceived "fake morality," referencing Geraldo Rivera and Shepard Smith, and briefly touched on rumors about Anderson Cooper.  Other segments included listener calls, reactions to a bus driver's fatal heart attack, discussion of a Grand Theft Auto ad on a bus, and a lengthy, offensively-worded critique of a Billy Crystal performance deemed unfunny by the hosts.  The eggnog challenge was again promoted, along with audio of various taser videos, including one featuring a dog.

A substantial portion detailed the hosts' and Jim Norton's scathing review of an 11-minute Billy Crystal performance, repeatedly using phrases like "can you dig it?" and "I knew you could" to mock it.  Multiple clips were played, highlighting awkward silences and lack of audience reaction.  The hosts compared Crystal unfavorably to Richard Pryor.  The show also addressed violent video game ads on Boston public transportation, the First Amendment, a Boston Herald article interviewing prostitutes about the ads, and a "walkover" to their XM studio with fans and women from a gentlemen's club, including coffee at Starbucks.

A heavily intoxicated female caller, "Lady Di," dominated a large segment, rambling about her son, a PlayStation 3, and a planned "homeless shopping spree," frequently using vulgar language and referencing oral sex with homeless men.  The hosts interrupted and mocked her, with another caller, Marion, initially defending Lady Di before arguing with the hosts.  The conversation included tangents about Norton’s supposed arrest, Thanksgiving, Lady Di's personal life (including her ex-boyfriend's alleged suicide attempt), and a video of Michael Richards using racial slurs.  The hosts planned future shows, potentially including Marion but explicitly excluding Lady Di.

Another segment began with an anecdote about a listener's mother and alleged "hobo cum" consumption, transitioning to a "Cake Girl" and "Lady Di."  A vulgar game brainstorming uses for "hobo cum" ensued.  Stalker Patty, a regular caller in the studio drinking champagne, was involved in an attempt to convince her to participate in a mock "bukkake" video, which was funded by listeners and staff ($300+).  The mock video's filming was described in detail, including Patty's reactions and the hosts' directions, before Patty left with the money.  The segment ended teasing a future segment about Michael Richards's racial rant.

A final segment featured Andrea, who brought a disastrous cake to the studio, leading to mockery from the hosts and staff. Craig, a staff member, eventually ate a piece, describing it as tasting like wet rubber.  A call from Jay Moore shared a humorous anecdote about Club Soda Kenny at a gym.  "Line of the day" winners were announced, the eggnog competition was mentioned, and a bizarre anecdote about Jimmy and a "Stalker Pets" toy concluded the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony show on XM202, featuring Ovi, Anthony, and James Norton.  I'm going to mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  Bye.  Watch into the virus.  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim, so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much with the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with their pure rage. 
[00:00:30]  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fast.  Who cares about the funny? Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he.  Ovi.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing. I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. I'm trying. 
[00:01:00]  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know. It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Ovi and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A.  AIDS.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  PAP PAP  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Everybody here after another weekend. 
[00:02:00]  Nice.  Almost everyone's here.  Good morning. Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Today, the microphones sound a little sharp.  They're very sharp. I like that.  Every day, it's a little different.  Yeah.  Someone likes to tweak when we're not here.  They're doing a little tweaking.  Tweak, sabotage, whatever you want to call it.  Yeah, something's going on. 
[00:02:30]  Someone has to justify a job.  Yeah, whatever.  I like to fix that.  Whatever.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  I start by asking Anthony, how was your weekend?  Wonderful.  I had a grand weekend.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I actually went out Saturday, but Sunday I was a shut-in.  Just played online poker and watched the Star Trek marathon.  That's not a bad day, right? 
[00:03:00]  That's pretty much it.  That was it.  Anytime there's a Star Trek marathon, I'm there.  But, you know, you don't pay absolute attention.  You've seen them 8 billion times.  So, let's play a little online poker.  And that was that.  Saturday, that was no-filter Paul's wife, Denise, her birthday.  Yeah, one of the faithful listeners.  Well, just to set it up for the rest of the listeners, he's, I don't know.  He is a faithful listener.  He's also paying the ass. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  He was brought to this show by little Jimmy Norton.  Mm-hmm.  And I curse Jimmy for that.  I curse Jimmy for that.  Oh, he's a complete inappropriate buffoon.  Although, although, you know, I'm huge into the YouTube.  Yeah.  Into the YouTube.  The YouTube.  I was watching no-filter Paul's diaper video over the weekend.  Yeah.  I forgot how funny that is, actually.  He has gone above and beyond a couple of times for the program.  So, you got to give him that much. 
[00:04:00]  What did he take?  He drank that stuff.  It was some kind of stuff, yeah, that just cleans your system out immediately.  Yeah, he did something stupid.  So, we...  Some kind of uber-laxative.  So, we made him suffer.  Yeah.  We did it over here, actually.  And we made him, like, drink this crap.  Yeah, uber-laxative.  Yep.  And he was able to hold out way too long, about an hour or so.  About an hour, but he was really squirming and percolating.  So, then he had to take a walk from this studio to the XM Studios in just a diaper. 
[00:04:30]  Wearing a diety.  As everyone's going to work at 9 o'clock in their suits and ties.  Barely noticing.  Pantsuits and whatever.  Yeah, they didn't even notice that.  Barely noticing.  You know, that's the one we got to bring up as an example.  Yeah.  People are like, well, how's the walkover?  And we're like, we've learned that most New Yorkers don't give a crap about anything.  They don't care about anything.  They don't notice much.  They're on their way to work, and that's all they care about.  And we usually use the example of carrying the Stanley Cup from this studio to the other,  and most people could care less than they noticed.  A lot of people don't know what that looks like, though.  Yeah.  I understand that.  We got to use the no-filter Paul example, because he's walking in just a diaper, no shoes, no shirt, just with his big, awful gut, and his head that's too small for his body. 
[00:05:00]  Lego hair.  Oh, he's just a mess.  Lego hair.  And then he gets over to XM, and we put him on a newspaper like you would a pet.  And next thing you know, he did what he had to do finally.  And that video is up on YouTube, by the way.  The screaming from the studio is just really funny and horrific at the same time. 
[00:05:30]  Can I have the Febreze spray for this microphone?  Oh, God.  I was going to wait.  I was actually thinking as a professional broadcaster, I was going to say, you know something?  I'm going to wait until we're done and go to break to do this.  So you don't change subjects.  I wouldn't be able to concentrate on anything anyone is saying.  Thank you, E-Rock. 
[00:06:00]  I need a spray, too.  I just...  The sounds you're hearing are microphones being clinked.  It should be done before the show.  It was being done before the show for about a week.  All right.  It's much better.  That's better.  That's what we need.  So anyway, that video is up on YouTube.  I guess you throw no-filter Paul into the search engine, and you'll find it.  I wish you could throw no-filter Paul into traffic. 
[00:06:30]  That's a good view, actually.  I got to admit.  So you went to his wife's birthday party?  Yeah, his wife's birthday party.  He had some message board people and friends of the show and stuff there that usually show up at events.  Some of the usual suspects.  But his two stepdaughters were brought along.  Dude, smoking hot.  Who, Paul's stepdaughters?  Yeah.  Really?  No-filter Paul has two stepdaughters that are hot?  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, call the authority.  And they just think he is the biggest douche.  Oh, really?  And they say it right to his face.  And, you know.  How old are they?  About 18 and 16, or 19 and 16.  And the 19-year-old is just wearing this real low-cut thing.  And, you know, just her upper end is hanging out.  Big boobies like mom?  She's got a tat right over her ass, and she was showing people.  Oh, the tramp stamp. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, nice.  Real nice.  She's got a tramp stamp.  Nice.  Yeah.  So she was just, you know, walking around, and everybody's just gawking.  Yeah.  And then he's got another stepdaughter, the 16-year-old, and she's definitely growing into something.  And then he's got a little daughter that's his and Denise's, and she is all him.  Just bad-mouthing him.  Oh, really?  Just bad-mouths him all the time.  Tells him the truth, you know. 
[00:08:00]  You're stupid.  Makes fun of him.  It's hysterical.  And I think she's like 10 and just goofs on him.  I watched them interact.  With the kid one time, when they came somewhere in Hasbro Heights or something, and it was  just awful and dysfunctional.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so completely dysfunctional that it was hysterical to watch.  Wait a minute.  You're supposed to be in jail.  Oh.  Hey, what are you doing here, convict?  So the party was good at? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I had some fun.  That was definitely, and Revali's totally hooked me up.  You know, something.  Remember when Revali's came down here and I couldn't eat because it was the one time  a year that I was having my physical done and had to get blood taken, and you can't eat  before you have blood tests.  Right.  So you guys are making, you guys were eating these big king crab legs and steaks.  Yes.  Soleil, mignon.  And I was like, I couldn't eat.  And you were rubbing it in, I might say. 
[00:09:00]  Oh.  You weren't very nice about it, boys.  No, just stuffing our faces.  Yeah.  Jimmy's like, oh, these crab legs.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I think we did half our show with our mouths really full that day.  Well, they surprised me and brought out two gigantic king crab legs, huge steak, and it  was really, really good.  Revali's is amazing.  And Tom's River.  Tom's River.  Big supporters of the radio program.  I made it down there so fast.  Took the rocket ship down.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Did about 90 and 100, around between 90 and 100 the whole way, and just waiting to get  pulled over.  At that point, I wasn't even looking for cops.  It was pretty much the law of the jungle, you know, where, you know, a gazelle at some  point is running by and sees another gazelle with its throat ripped out and knows that could  have been them.  But you're just playing the law averages, hoping that, you know, you're not the guy that gets  caught.  Yeah.  I just did that.  We're also playing, hoping you're not the guy that wraps the car around the pole. 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  No, it's, believe me, this thing is.  Hey, we play the same game.  Practically drives itself, Jim.  Yeah?  No.  Can I do a radio show, too?  See, I turn off my cell phone.  Everyone knows that.  But I turn it back on every Monday morning.  Yeah.  And I just hope I'm not getting that just horrific message from you.  Nah, you'd hear it before that.  Probably Brother Joe will give me the message.  Nah, you'd hear it before that.  You think?  Yeah, make the news.  So, it's the Shelby, you know?  Believe me, I wrap this up, it's making the news. 
[00:10:30]  Because I'm taking out a few people.  The good old Shelby.  Yes.  The Shelby GT.  Which was voted Car of the Year.  Oh, look at that.  Congratulations, Anthony.  Car of the Year.  Of course it was.  In Maxim Magazine.  Muscle car.  They've started their year-end list in all the magazines.  And yeah, there it is.  The Ford Shelby Car of the Year.  With a supercharged 5.4 liter V8 cranking out 500 horsepower.  500 horse, my man.  The Shelby is the most powerful factory-built Mustang ever. 
[00:11:00]  Still unimpressed?  Then get on your Razor scooter and return to the organic vegetable co-op, you damn hippie.  That's right.  See, that wasn't me.  That was Maxim Magazine.  Because they're really funny with their comedy.  Yeah, you want to feel your head just get pushed back into a seat.  Yeah.  Hit the gas on this thing.  You'd like it, Jimmy.  You have an addictive personality.  Yeah, I do.  But I'm not driving fast.  Not driving fast.  I don't like it. 
[00:11:30]  I don't like being in a car where someone else is driving fast.  I like just being alone in the car driving fast.  Wait a minute.  Weren't you arrested?  Yeah, say.  Hey, but I prefer driving the speed limit.  Because you're a good boy.  You don't drive the speed limit.  I do, actually.  A little faster than the speed limit.  I mean, I'll do 70, but I'm not going to do 140.  That's not the speed limit.  I don't do 140.  Huh?  I don't do 140.  I could if I would if I could.  What's the difference between 100 and 140 if you're wrecked?  40. 
[00:12:00]  If you're wrecked.  No, if you're wrecked, there's no problem.  But as far as control goes and on the roads, there's a big difference.  Do you want to go to the track and do it?  That's fine.  There's no there is no reason to do 140 miles an hour on the roads.  If you're racing somebody, you've already proven you've beat them or not well before 140 miles an hour.  So there's no reason to.  Then you're really asking for trouble.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, roads ain't built for 140.  They are built for 100. 
[00:12:30]  Well, here's the deal.  Well, we're trying to get some messages off some phones and then we'll get into the Jim Norton situation situation situation.  God, I hate some of these message boards.  I got to tell you, the douche bags can't go with a effing prank.  Can't go with a bitch?  To save their lives.  No.  That's why I say eat your own.  Eat your own.  There's got to be spoiled a bit, guy.  I went on the message boards on Friday after the show and there's people just blowing up our spot. 
[00:13:00]  And then other people saying, oh, I knew it was a prank the whole time.  Did you?  I knew it was.  Did you?  It wasn't even, like, it wasn't funny.  There was no point to it.  There was no, oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you.  So.  Like it was a real planned out anything.  So you know better than Jimmy's family, right?  Yeah.  Apparently they do.  Asses.  It wasn't believable.  It wasn't believable, really. 
[00:13:30]  Wait till you hear the messages from Jim's father and Jim's sister.  And my phone rang all weekend long.  Oh, lovely to get off to a plane to that.  Oh, lovely.  And I went to the stress factory.  You're welcome, Jimmy.  I went to the stress factory on Friday to see Bill Burr, and I'm sitting in the audience.  It wasn't believable.  Bill Burr's set was almost ruined because people were yelling out, how's Jimmy?  When is he getting out?  But you, you just know more than anybody else, and you had to blow up everyone's fun.  God, I hate you. 
[00:14:00]  I really hate you.  That is the animal that is the message board.  It's a living, breathing entity that can start as one thing and mutate into another.  Yeah.  They're wonderful.  They don't get the show.  There's people that call themselves like Uber fans that don't get the show.  They don't get the show.  Yeah.  Because they have to make it about themselves.  They think they're bigger than the show. 
[00:14:30]  They think they're bigger than a message board.  They've got to show everybody how much they know.  Look how smart I am.  Well, if you figured out, great.  But guess what?  Jimmy's own family didn't figure it out.  So I guess we did pretty good with that one.  You certainly did.  Somebody posted something like, oh, they bashed the whole thing and then said, you know, Andy Kaufman wouldn't be proud.  And I wrote, yeah, he wouldn't be proud because he's dead. 
[00:15:00]  Because he's rotting.  Jackass.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break.  Are they getting the messages right now?  Oh, I already had my three unloaded.  Oh, boy.  How many more are we waiting for?  We got them on disc yet?  All right.  Here's the deal.  On Friday, if you miss Friday's show or whatever, we start the show by basically saying we are going to start a rumor.  And we said Jim Norton was arrested.  And then for the rest of the show, we kind of just played into it a little bit, very casually here and there. 
[00:15:30]  And believe it or not, most people bought it.  Most people bought it, including Jimmy's father, Jimmy's sister.  Jimmy's mother.  Jimmy's mother.  Oh, no.  A lot of Jimmy's friends.  Jimmy's friends.  Jimmy's friends in Vegas.  Jimmy's friends in New York.  Oh, lovely flight.  All right, we'll get into the whole thing because this is the beauty of it.  Jimmy was flying out to Vegas.  Yeah.  So we did our show saying that he was arrested. 
[00:16:00]  No one could get a hold of Jimmy because he was in flight for the five, six-hour flight, whatever it is these days.  And when he landed, he turns his phone back on and there's nothing but messages.  Oh, yeah, because you have no clue.  So you just land and go, hey, what's all these messages?  You're busy being on the plane.  Yeah, so food.  So after the break, we'll get into how Jimmy found out and all that, and then we'll play his messages, all right?  Yeah.  And we'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:16:30]  It's the 2006 Eggnog Challenge coming to the Opie and Anthony Show Friday, December 1st.

It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  Good morning, Dallas.  Dallas?  Is that what we're saying good morning to?  It's all about Dallas today, man.  What about Cleveland?  It's all about Dallas. 
[00:17:30]  They took out the Colts.  It's all about Dallas this morning.  How about them Cowboys, Jimmy?  I don't watch really much sports anymore, but I was happy just to see them smell.  I'm tired of the stupid Colts already.  Indianapolis has never produced anything that didn't suck.  Ooh.  Because you're busy.  They have the Colts, and they have Bob and Tom.  That's what we get in Indianapolis.  Cowboys took out the Colts.  It was a great game, actually.  21-14. 
[00:18:00]  Stupid Jets.  Oops.  Stupid Jets.  Getting shut out by the Bears, but the Bears, hey, good morning, Chicago.  Hey, Chicago, how are you doing?  That's what I say.  Good morning, Chicago.  Good morning, Dallas.  And also, good morning, Philly.  Good morning, Philly.  Philly had a little bit of a setback over the weekend.  I blame Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  The Bill Burr curse.  Bill Burr called it when he was bitching at Philly. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, my God.  From that stage.  After Philly was booing him for no reason.  At the Tweeter Center in Camden.  Oh, my God.  He called it.  The freaking Bill Burr curse.  There you go.  He actually wished McNabb would have broken both ankles, I believe.  I forget.  And been out forever.  Yeah.  Or at least for the season.  Yeah.  Well, he did what Bob Kelly did.  He kind of did the same thing to his knee. 
[00:19:00]  Over 8 until he almost died?  Yeah.  No.  He broke his effing knee, man.  Broke his effing knee.  Yeah.  He broke his knee, man.  Bob didn't break his knee.  He was getting so heavy, his knee tried to hung an egg.  How did I blow that one?  His knee tried to hung itself because it does things in two different tens.  What an ass I was.  Oh, boy.  You should go back to jail, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Jail doesn't suit you very well.  No.  Yeah, that was a good one, too. 
[00:19:30]  When are they releasing your sense of humor?  They're not going through right now.  It's being stitched due to the raping it took.  God almighty, what a pummeling my sense of humor took.  Bad day for Philly, though, man.  Yeah, he's out for the season.  Absolutely.  So who's their backup guy?  Oh, it's...  Anyone know?  It's the guy from the other team.  Yeah.  He was the guy and then...  They got him with the...  But he did, like, a few years back.  That thing.  But then and now... 
[00:20:00]  Well, yeah.  Exactly.  He was going to start, but there was that whole...  He had the injury and then all of a sudden they moved him over to the other team.  Yeah, that thing.  And then now they got him because he's now going to have to because McNabb's out.  Yeah, John Kitna.  Yeah.  Didn't I say that at the beginning of the day?  You sure did.  I thought I said it.  I was just reiterating what you said there.  All right.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's your local break for Philly this morning.  Hey, Philly.  Good morning.  I'm so sorry to hear about that.  By the way, I went three for five with the football picks, of course.  Three for five?  Who picked your picks? 
[00:20:30]  Who the hell was it?  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr did a pretty good job.  He did pick the Colts.  I should have been four for five.  Come on.  Let's be honest here.  Yeah.  I was three for five this week.  I gained one on Steve.  Steve still leads the season.  32 total picks.  Then you got Travis with 31.  And then I'm in third place with 28 picks.  Of course, the winner will win $10,000 courtesy of Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  I could fix the Prius.  I could fix the Prius.  Could you be behind two less masculine fellows? 
[00:21:00]  I know.  I know.  I got two girls beating me.  I'm tied for third with Sissy Spacek.  Yeah.  But Steve, for some reason, knows his football.  They do.  See, but Steve says he doesn't really know much about football at all.  So we think he's got like a ringer helping him out every week.  Got someone helping him?  I have to believe that at this point.  I wouldn't even think Steve knows someone manly enough to pick football.  No?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Who's Steve socializing with outside of work?  Gay men at rest stops and who?  Who knows?  Jimmy, you missed it.  He couldn't come to work Friday either.  Why?  I couldn't make it.  I tried.  The Prius wouldn't start.  The Prius.  There's a problem with the Prius.  And then he tried to explain it in an email.  And I was just laughing.  I couldn't even understand what it meant.  It was like I tried to start it.  And it started for a little while.  But then it only went to electric.  And it wouldn't go back to the guest. 
[00:22:00]  So I tried.  Here I am trying to start it.  Come on, baby.  I have to get to work.  Stupid Prius.  How long has he had that dumb car?  Too long.  Just stop already with your hybrid.  Enough.  The gayest name for a car, too.  The Prius.  The Prius.  See, they don't want people to drive the hybrid cars either. 
[00:22:30]  Or they would have come up with some kind of cool name for it.  Who's going to admit that they drive a Prius?  I believe there is a type of car that does much better in this environment,  in this type of city driving, as far as saving gas goes.  Like the Prius, I think, would be fine if you live in rural Oklahoma.  And you're just driving highway miles all the time.  But if you're commuting like this, it doesn't help. 
[00:23:00]  But Steve's helping the environment.  I think he got pee-whipped into buying that.  Oh, you think the old lady made him?  I don't know.  I hate to say it.  No, man.  I think he did.  Yeah, his old lady's a lot cooler than Steve.  Steve doesn't seem like the type that would do something like that.  He believes the height.  He reads a few of those books, and he's believing all of it.  Steve?  Yeah.  Speaking of driving, on the way in today, you know gas prices have been dropping nicely. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  The price per barrel way down, like $20 since it's high.  Well, do you know that the gas prices have been kind of creeping up the last week to 10 days?  A little bit, because of the holidays.  Because of the holidays?  Exactly.  Because everyone's ready to drive again?  Yeah.  Freaking bastards.  That's what it is.  They know.  Just creeping up.  And they don't want to do it drastically, because then you're like,  oh, obviously it's because we're all going to be driving for Thanksgiving.  No, they're just adding a penny here, a penny there.  Yeah, it goes slow.  The past couple of weeks, it's gone up like a nickel.  Just moving it up a bit. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, just a little before the holidays.  They know.  Bastards.  It's hard to find bigger scum than the people that work in the gas industry.  And there's no real accountability as to who is doing it.  Like, is it the frigging,  at the gas station?  Is he the guy just going out and deciding,  I'm going to rake in a couple more bucks per gallon?  Is it the guys that own the gas stations?  Is it the oil companies?  Man.  Like, who's jacking the prices up?  I don't know. 
[00:24:30]  I think it is just kind of a, you know,  the Arabs across the street from each other at the Exxon and the Shell station  look at each other, give a little wink, and go, okay.  And they, like, hold up three fingers.  All right.  Three cents more today, my friend.  And then they get that goofy thing that changes the prices.  I need my gas price stick.  Gas price stick.  It's called a gas price stick?  I don't know.  Probably.  I got to communicate.  It's called the explosive, too.  Communicate.  Steve's wife hates his car.  Really?  Look at it the other day.  And Kidna plays for Detroit, by the way. 
[00:25:00]  It is Jeff Garcia?  Jeff Garcia's the backup in Philly?  All right.  And how did we get that erroneous information?  Ah, well, uh...  Than?  Nathaniel skipped it over.  Was it more like, uh, was it Dr. Asparagus again?  Coming in with some bad information?  Boy.  That was Travis.  Way to go, Travis.  Travis.  Good job, Bitrooner.  Mm-hmm.  Wanted to make it sound like we knew what the hell we were talking about.  Um, all right.  All right, here we go.  So, um, we started this rumor on Friday.  Jim Norton getting arrested. 
[00:25:30]  We hinted that it was because he was caught with a tranny in the meatpacking district.  Yeah.  And, uh, we thought we'd have a little fun with that.  But, of course, you know, somebody on Whackbag, a few people on Whackbag, one of our message boards,  felt like no one should have any fun.  No one should have any fun.  And they know better.  And they're bigger than the show.  So they couldn't wait to post and say how it was just a rumor.  And they had to prove it was a rumor right away.  And make sure it just wrecked everyone's, uh, fun as far as the show goes.  And then you get this ass. 
[00:26:00]  Uh, Hallport.  H-A-U-L-P-O-R-T.  He has one post.  So he's probably a Howard fan, to be honest with you.  Is that or he's just another message board guy?  They're not always Howard fans.  Sometimes there are other message board guys that want to say something,  but, um, don't have the balls to say it behind their already fake name.  So they say it behind that name.  So their fake character name, uh, doesn't have to say it.  So their fake character name with the high post count.  Yeah.  And which equals respect for some stupid reason. 
[00:26:30]  Dude, I got 4,000 posts.  Uh, you can't touch me.  I'm untouchable.  Really?  I would be more, I would be more mad if this Hallport had a lot of posts.  He has one.  So obviously he had some kind of agenda.  Yeah.  What's even scarier is that our own Anthony has 1,470 posts on a message board.  And, and like...  1,469 of them are me bitching someone out.  God.  I think I got two posts.  I, I do a lot of the Photoshop threads.  They're fun. 
[00:27:00]  I go there.  There are fun things on some message boards, but you're not going to get a hundred percent.  There are going to be douches that just wreck the experience for everybody.  That's the essence of a message board.  I, uh, I lurk.  I don't pull.  You need a good, cool person to douchebag ratio on a message board to make it go-to-able.  There are a few I just don't visit because their douchebag ratio way too high.  I want a graph, please, of douchebag to cool guy ratios as per message boards. 
[00:27:30]  You know, you, you speak the truth too.  That's why I say from time to time, you got to eat your own.  You got to eat your own.  There are message boards out there that we don't even acknowledge anymore because they  were too stupid, uh, not to eat their own.  And don't say, oh, you guys can't take criticism.  Criticism is great.  I've had one of my 1,470 posts, uh, might be accepting criticism.  Now there's a few of them that if somebody has a valid point and it's critic, criticism,  be okay.  That's your point. 
[00:28:00]  You know, other people seem to like it or blah, blah, blah, whatever.  But when it's just like either getting on you personally or just like, uh, just somebody  saying something sucks without anything to back it up.  It's like, you just back it up.  Or if you didn't like it, so who cares if you didn't like it?  And it's the same 20, 30 people posting over and over.  Yep.  So this guy, he writes on the message board as far as Jimmy's arrest goes.  So rumors like these, unless they have some sort of payoff or just a waste of time, I 
[00:28:30]  don't feel had, I don't feel like I wasted my time.  And it's not even funny.  If it was something really effed up that scared everybody, like Jimmy has AIDS for real, then  that might be funny.  What?  Uh-huh.  It would be more funny if they pulled a prank on the news or something.  Andy Kaufman would not be proud.  Oh, it would.  Yeah.  So then Anthony with his 1470th post.  Let me, oh my God.  Let me get this. 
[00:29:00]  I wrote, uh, you're such a tool.  I use a lot of exclamation points when I post too.  That time is necessary though.  I even used one, two, three, four on, uh, the next sentence.  I mean, you're such a tool.  You don't get it.  Things like this are for the message boards.  We can't just do something to have fun with you guys.  It has to be some kind of well-planned bit.  It was off the cuff first of all.  Yeah.  It gets a load of people speculating and wondering if it's bull or not. 
[00:29:30]  Wow.  I guess Mr. One Post knows more than everyone else though.  We weren't looking to make Andy Kaufman proud.  He's dead.  By the way, since it was such a waste of time, I guess on Monday we won't be playing the phone messages that Jimmy got from his parents thinking he was in jail.  Leave radio to us and you do what you're good at.  Getting f***ed by other men up your faggot hole.  That didn't make the radio. 
[00:30:00]  Why wouldn't it make the radio?  It should.  Did it make it?  It had to.  Thumbs up.  I don't know.  It has to.  I think this is going to be a panicky Pete on that one.  No.  No?  All right.  All right.  So we got the, uh, so Jimmy, why don't you take it from here?  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  So you flew off the bed.  Look at these idiots.  What?  Some idiots are writing.  Didn't make it through.  It was all bleeped.  No.  Look, idiot.  I bleeped.  See?  I can even talk over the bleep.  People don't understand the bleep bit yet.  But I'm bleeping myself. 
[00:30:30]  It's the bleep bit.  It's so we can do it on regular radio.  But you know what I'm saying.  It gets around like I could say, hey, uh.  Got dumped.  I knew it.  Your mother loves to.  Why?  What?  I knew it got dumped.  I knew it would.  Because of the, uh, H word part.  Hole.  The word hole.  God almighty.  I knew it would get dumped, Ant.  Okay.  Here we go.  Last line.  I knew he would just get really nervous.  Leave radio to us and you do what you're good at. 
[00:31:00]  Getting bleeped by other men up your faggot bleeped.  There you go.  How's that?  I don't know.  Hole.  All right.  Just let it be.  Screw it.  Ah, Jesus.  Screw it all, man.  The stupid man.  They're bleeping everything.  Yes, they are.  You hear me?  Do you hear me talk over the bleep? 
[00:31:30]  The man is keeping us down.  Oh, that's so funny.  So you flew to Vegas.  This was just an off-the-cuff dumb thing we started on Friday.  You had no clue about it.  You were in the air, you touched down, you turned on your phone, and then what happened?  Well, I got off the plane.  I turned my phone on, I didn't even listen to any messages, and then Kenny comes over,  and you know how he just, he lives.  You're in jail.  He lives for bad news.  Of course.  I don't want to tell you.  I don't want to upset you.  You want nothing more.  I mean, whenever Kenny's eyes get wide, he's relishing in the moment. 
[00:32:00]  Loves bad news.  You guys at home can't see this, but Kenny has an expressionless face, and when he, he's  like, his eyebrows raised and his eyes open, he goes, I don't want to tell you anything  that's going to upset you, and you know that he's clamoring to tell you something that's  going to upset you.  The hospitals should hire Kenny to tell families that their family members have died.  Go into that waiting room and just tell them.  Kenny loves spreading rumors, by the way.  Oh, he's a chatty Cathy. 
[00:32:30]  What a gossip he is.  He loves gossip, and we all trust him thinking he's not going to talk to others, but he does.  He does.  He just loves it.  He writes it all down for his book.  Right.  You didn't get this from me.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard Kenny go, you didn't get this from me, but.  There's no one else we could have gotten it from.  It's bad news, and it's relatively ill-informed.  I get off, and he goes, they must be doing something on the radio, because I get messages  from your father, and they think you're in jail. 
[00:33:00]  And I'm like, what?  Why?  I laughed, because I figured, well, they must have said something.  What do these idiots do?  And I wish Kenny was here right now, but he's out getting stuff.  I'm getting things.  He's getting egg whites.  I wish I could be there.  You know.  Well, they want me to go out and get food.  I mean, uh.  You know, just a man who's caught in a bad situation.  That's Kenny.  That's Kenny all the time.  Regular Joe, caught in a bad place.  Um.  So we got, uh.  The first thing I did before I listened to any messages. 
[00:33:30]  Mm-hmm.  Is I called home.  I had to, because as soon as he said what it was, I'm like, the guy's supposed to say  something on the air.  And, uh.  I talked to my dad, and I'm like, yeah, everything's okay.  And they pushed my mother on the phone.  Oh, no.  And she's crying.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, stop.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That's what I dealt with when I got to Vegas.  It's 10 in the morning, I guess, West Coast time. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, Jimmy, your mommy was crying.  I know.  I wish you would have left me a tear-filled message.  Oh, that would be great.  But, um.  Not this time.  I didn't hear any of the messages Kenny got.  Yeah, we got him.  There he is.  Okay.  What did, Kenny, when you came off the plane.  Oh, God.  You said, uh.  You said to me, uh.  I guess the first thing you listened to your messages, and you're like, are your parents  think you're in jail?  Yeah, yeah.  We plainly ended.  You can turn on your cell phone.  I had seven voicemail messages.  And I was like, you know, what's going on? 
[00:34:30]  I never get that many messages.  And, uh.  So I started playing them right away.  And the first one was kind of garbled.  And I could just get bits and pieces.  And I, you know, and I, it was from Jimmy's father.  And I got, like, nervous.  Like, what was going on?  And then I couldn't really understand.  Is Jimmy okay?  Did his plane go down?  Oh, wait a minute.  I was on the same plane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did this part of the plane go down after we landed?  Not as often.  First class crashed.  Jimmy, I don't know how to tell you this, but you were arrested last night. 
[00:35:00]  The eyes wide open.  I don't want to upset you.  That's what I told him.  I go, please.  You always say that.  I was like, please.  And then you're the one that upsets us.  Do you understand that yet?  But he doesn't want to.  Right.  Here's what I know, Kenny, wants to upset you.  Because whenever he says that, his shoes bulge because his toes are curling with joy and  anticipation.  His toes are, like, clenching and unclenching.  His little boots are rising.  Just loving it.  I can never win because you always shoot the messenger. 
[00:35:30]  No, I don't.  I never shoot the messenger.  I know.  I know.  But in general.  Wow.  All right.  So I got, you know, the second message, I understood clearly.  You can hear it.  Like, it was from Jim's father.  They heard.  His mother was all upset hysterical.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Laughing?  No.  No.  No.  No.  I mean, look what you did to your mom again.  And then the third message now was the father in the car on his cell phone driving to Jim's  sister's house.  Call him on the cell phone now. 
[00:36:00]  Right?  And then the fourth message was from Jim's sister.  Terrible.  Like, has to know what's going on because they got to know that he's all right.  You know.  I feel awful.  Why would a family have to go?  Why should they have to go through that?  And then I had to tell Jimmy, so I'm thinking, like, how do I, you know, how do I, like,  break the news to him, you know?  Well, how can you, I don't know, how many people have to explain to their parents, no,  I wasn't arrested picking up a transsexual prostitute.  I wasn't. 
[00:36:30]  Like, any parent should just know that that wouldn't happen.  Of course it didn't happen.  But, you know, there's no faith in it.  No faith whatsoever.  No.  As soon as you say it on the air, they're like, it's got to be true.  Let's get the bail.  Yeah.  Must be true.  Fruit cup got arrested.  I got a couple more calls throughout the day.  A Florentine called me.  He wanted to know what was going on because he was mad, like, if Norton got arrested,  he must be slipping.  Yeah, yeah.  Norton's a pro.  Yeah, like, he knows all the code words.  He knows what to say and do.  So, like, what happened?  He had to know.  So, when you called home, what did your dad say? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, I'm standing there with my girlfriend and I'm just listening to my father saying,  your mother's upset.  I'm like, all right, because it was her birthday the day before.  Uh-huh.  And I hadn't called her for her birthday because my sister reminded me too late.  So, I'm like, ah, I'll call tomorrow when I get to Vegas.  I'll give her a call.  It was her birthday?  Yeah.  So, this was the, I didn't get arrested picking up a tranny prostitute slash happy birthday.  Oh, no.  It's always good to combine calls.  Like, if you can, so, sometimes you have to combine the, I didn't get busted with a  hooker and I love you on your birthday call. 
[00:37:30]  That's normal.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's horrid.  So, could you understand what she was saying through the tears or?  Yeah, well, at first she was okay and then she kind of fell apart.  Oh, God.  Like, she's like, we just, you didn't get arrested?  Like, she didn't believe it at first?  I'm like, no, I'm in Vegas.  They were saying on the radio.  I'm like, oh, my God.  They say a lot of things on the radio, Ma.  Don't listen.  Yeah, but it was the phone call.  Like, it was the tears of gratitude that her firstborn son wasn't in jail for paying a 
[00:38:00]  man in the dress for favors.  That is great.  No, it's not.  It is great.  I feel terrible.  That nice woman.  They are nice people, but I have to.  Of course they are.  Great.  Jimmy thinks it's great, too.  I do.  I knew it was a bit, it was just like, you know, it was just a weird time because they  couldn't call me because I was on a plane.  Yeah.  We know about that.  Well, Jimmy called.  Something happened with the mayor of Boston.  He was on a plane, too, when we said a little something.  Jimmy called all of us, and when he talked to me, he's like, yeah, I got messages from 
[00:38:30]  my mom and dad.  They really think I got arrested, and they're really upset.  And then Jimmy goes into his Jim Norton laugh when he thinks something is beyond funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I was a man.  I thought it was great.  Anthony, I called the aunt, too.  I'm like, what did you go?  I wanted to know, like, what happened?  Because I knew you said something.  He's like, I'm sorry.  You're like, I'm sorry.  I'm like, why are you sorry?  Whenever parents cry, oh, it's terrible.  Well, you know.  All right, listen.  It's the price you pay.  Yeah, it's true. 
[00:39:00]  We really have to take a break.  If we go to break without playing, one of these people are going to be really mad.  Yeah.  We got, like, seven.  Let me play the first one here.  All right.  And then we'll play the rest of them after the break, okay?  Who is this from?  Jim's dad.  This is to Kenny, right?  To Kenny's voicemail.  The first one's garbled.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Oh, it's even a better tease.  I mean, uh...  Hey, Kenny.  I'm going to the gym.  This was the gym.  And we just want to know if it's something going on or if they're just pulling somebody's 
[00:39:30]  leg.  So if you can, just give me a call.  You know, let me know what's going on, Jimmy.  So we want to find out what's going on.  I'll talk to you later, buddy.  Jesus.  All the pertinent stuff is like...  I know.  Yeah, that's why I was even freaking out more.  Yeah.  I couldn't...  Jim, why are you taking Genesis from us?  What are you talking about?  All the important stuff's all garbled out. 
[00:40:00]  Jodie Foster got a clearer message in contact.  The rest of the voicemails are much better.  Oh, yeah.  They're all clear.  All right.  Crisp and clear, filled with fatherly concern.  All right.  Very good.  We'll play the rest of them after the break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opiananthony.com. 
[00:40:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, a lot of excitement here in New York City.  I got to tell you.  I got to tell you, everybody.  I got to tell you.  Yeah, that was pretty radio of you.  I know.  Yeah, a lot of excitement here in New York City.  I got to tell you.  Oh, man.  I took a ride out to Long Island this weekend, all the way out to South Hole to see little  little Carson, my nephew, play corner cornerback. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, that's adorable.  Eight-year-old playing football.  Nice.  Yeah.  Teach him young.  He's an animal out there.  Is he?  He really is, actually.  That's what you need.  I believe we have a few athletes in the family.  Oh, yeah.  Anyway, I was listening to this radio all weekend long.  God, is it awful out there.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  It is just God awful.  I don't have much out there. 
[00:41:30]  You're talking.  You're way out on Long Island.  And they all sound the same, so I'm not really sure, but WBLI, I think, on Long Island, they're  doing the hack bit where they're going to have someone on a crane or something.  Yeah.  And they're not going to let them down until they collect a lot of food for everybody this  Thanksgiving.  Are you kidding?  Are people still doing that?  You've got to be kidding.  And then they're just hacking it up.  Like, we don't want him to be there past the New Year's.  Come on, people. 
[00:42:00]  Make sure.  Stop hop by with your cans.  Hop, hop, hop.  Hop, hop.  Hop, hop.  Hop, hop.  He's going to be up there quite a while.  He's got to get home to his family.  I do it.  Oh.  Oh, God.  And then every radio station is just claiming to be the best radio station on the planet.  And they all play the same crap.  Just the same crap.  And the DJs are just reading liners saying how great they are, but they're not doing anything.  Yeah, that's their job.  Oh, my God.  To read little liners that tell how great they are. 
[00:42:30]  And then they just do the same thing everyone else is doing.  Anyway, a lot of excitement here in New York City because David Blaine is going to start his next attention-getting stunt tomorrow.  He's doing his next Rune Traffic.  And I think it starts tomorrow.  Wine for attention.  What is this one?  Do you know how – here's how bored I am with him.  I read a little thing on Drudge.  It said David Blaine's new stunt or new trick or illusion or whatever the hell he wants to call it. 
[00:43:00]  I didn't even click on the link.  I have a vested interest in this as an entertainer to know everything that's going on.  I could care less what his next stunt is.  Because he's let us down so many times and no one cares anymore.  He's not Houdini.  He's the Geraldo Al Capone's vault of magic.  It's his latest attention-getting stunt.  It's all about getting attention for him.  Well, what is it? 
[00:43:30]  Because I have no clue.  And this stupid city of ours allows him to do these stunts.  He gives him all the permits.  Enough with David Blaine.  He's a hack.  All the rubes from other lands all gather around.  New Yorkers might give a passing glance and some of the retard New Yorkers stand around and watch.  But for the most part, when they interview people, it's always,  Oh, well, I'm here from England and this is just wonderful to see David Blaine.  Is it?  Is it?  What's he doing now?  Illusionist David Blaine unveils latest stunt, U.S.  They have to say U.S. magician. 
[00:44:00]  Why?  We don't want to take credit for this guy.  Say Israel.  Say Iraq.  Say Germany.  I don't care.  U.S. magician.  I guess it's a worldwide story.  U.S. magician David Blaine will try to escape.  Try to escape.  I don't know if he's going to be able to do it, people.  Oh, boy.  This could be the one.  Keep the emergency crews nearby.  Will try to escape from shackles after spending two days in a spinning gyroscope. 
[00:44:30]  Or gyroscope.  Gyroscope.  A gyro.  A gyro.  I know.  I was thinking food.  Sorry.  Gyro.  Suspended above New York next week.  The illusionist said Friday unveiling his latest stunt.  Okay.  He's going to be on a spin ride for how long?  Two days.  Two days of spinning.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That could be funny.  Oh, I just, I hope there's just waves of vomit on the people watching.  Is he just going to be hanging on and spinning? 
[00:45:00]  Or if he's going to be in some kind of structure, then he's not spinning at all.  All I'm thinking is one of those things that you see at a lot of those, like, like Oz  Fest and all those rock things where in the carnival atmosphere area, you grab on, you put  your feet in, you grab on, and it spins you in three different directions.  Yeah.  You ever see those?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're like going, whoa, whoa.  Like in one of those.  That would be cool.  For the whole time.  How many times does it spin a minute?  I read that.  There's a certain amount of emotions it makes. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, hold on.  We got to deal with this idiot.  Who the heck?  What's up?  Morning, fellas.  Good morning.  You know, Opie, if you substituted O&A for what you're saying about David Blaine, all  your traffic stopping stunts are to promote yourself.  Not that there's anything wrong with it.  No, who the heck?  Here's the deal, okay?  Yes, we're great at promoting ourselves.  We've always been good at promoting ourselves.  But ours have a payoff in the end.  There's never a payoff with David Blaine. 
[00:46:00]  Don't you get it?  Well, that's a fair perspective, isn't it?  You sit there, and he's like, wow, he's in a block of ice.  And then he gets out of the block of ice.  What do you want him to do, die?  Well, dude, you've got to realize David Blaine will do something that for two days has no  movement at all.  Nothing for two days.  He's just frozen.  Dude, he was in an orb last year with water.  It's like people watch nothing.  There's no payoff in the end.  He has to make believe, like, oh, no, he might die, and he collapses, and they take  him away. 
[00:46:30]  He's a hack.  That's the payoff, the threat of death.  No, but you can see right through it if you have half a brain.  But you've got to recognize that most of the people that come out here...  You've got to recognize...  It's a promotion for what?  It's a promotion for David Blaine.  That's what I'm saying.  For his latest attention-getting stunt.  But that's what people do to promote themselves.  Just like you promote yourselves that way.  Who the heck?  I agree with you to a certain extent, but you've got to have a payoff.  His stunts don't have a payoff.  And what did you...  In England, we're a bunch of dope...  We're a bunch of dopes. 
[00:47:00]  Dude, the bits...  Going to jail.  The difference is the bits here, or you're getting laughs at least during the bits, is  something continuous happening during the bit.  Right.  With him, there's nothing happening during the bit.  He's suspended.  Nothing happening for two days.  Nothing happening...  Dude, you know when he was in a block of ice a couple years ago?  All he did was photo ops, where people from around America were walking up to the block  of ice, and he was actually smiling?  Is this David Blaine?  Like, there was nothing to it.  This is David Blaine, isn't it? 
[00:47:30]  My favorite David Blaine thing is the floating trick he does.  That's my favorite David Blaine thing.  But that's a sight gag and a visual trick.  He's a good street magician, but when it comes to these over-the-top promotional things,  he stinks.  He gets people's reactions, but he's going to be hanging from...  No, that's him hanging from a crane.  Is he really hanging on by one hand without being tired?  I think that's just a promotional shot.  Your arm wouldn't be able to take that for two days.  No, no, no.  I mean, even for the photo, for a few minutes. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So on Tuesday, here's to answer Jimmy's question.  We've got to get Jimmy's voicemails from his dad and his sister on the air in a couple  minutes here.  On Tuesday, Blaine will be locked spread eagle in the gyroscope, which will then be hoisted  50 feet into the air, and spun at up to 80 revolutions a minute until Thursday, when  he will try to escape.  80 RPM.  To avoid any problematic calls of nature, the 33-year-old will not eat or drink for as long  as it takes to empty a system. 
[00:48:30]  He loves not eating or drinking.  And putting a catheter in himself.  That's how he loses weight.  He stunts once a year to lose it.  It's the David Blaine diet.  He gets chubby in between stunts.  He's spinning 80 times a minute?  Yeah.  Don't buy the hype, Jimmy.  Don't buy it!  Oh, boy.  I'm starting to buy it.  He's spinning 80 times a minute.  You guys are buying it.  I'm starting to think this is really cool.  Oh, no.  If he's really spinning 80 times a minute, that's impressive.  Yeah.  That's impressive.  If you can do that for more than a minute, I'm impressed. 
[00:49:00]  Because I would throw up horribly.  I'd have to take Dramamine when I'm flying.  I don't even like the teacup ride at Disney.  I don't either.  Oh, gets me dizzy.  And he's going to be exposed to the elements.  Exposed to the elements with the performer saying that he only hoped it wouldn't rain or  snow while he dangles above a vacant lot near Manhattan's Times Square.  Why?  Why does the city allow him to do these stunts every year?  Why can't we come up with a stunt?  It's good for revenue.  Let's go to the mayor's office and go, all right.  We want to, yeah, we'll come up with something ridiculous and try to get a permit. 
[00:49:30]  Why does he get to do these?  Because his stunts, when we play devil's advocate, are kind of harmless and fun and  interesting in an illusionist way.  And people come by to see them and then frequent the shops that are around the area.  Yes.  Whereas this is like, all right, let's get a bunch of guys in ACDC t-shirts to run next  to a bus with teenagers exposing themselves or let's get people to have sex in FAO shorts.  Yeah.  Maybe they wouldn't give us a permit.  Yeah, probably not.  Can we throw stuff at him this time like they did in England? 
[00:50:00]  In London?  What was it?  London?  Oh, you could.  When he was in that glass box just living for what, a week or something?  You're getting in trouble.  Yeah, he couldn't even come up with a gag on that one.  It's just, I'm going to be in a box.  I'm going to be in a box, you know, above your head for about a week.  Yeah.  People who's shooting paintballs at us.  Yeah, throwing, like, sandwiches.  Got to love them in London.  Anyway, let's say hi to Rude Dog.  Rude Dog.  Hey, what's happening, boys?  What's up, Rude Dog?  I just wanted to say that screw all these people that don't agree with this joke. 
[00:50:30]  It's Monday, and these phone calls are hilarious.  I mean, you guys made Jimmy's mom cry.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get into the voicemails.  Yeah.  Good point, Rude Dog.  Thanks for getting us back on track.  All right, so the setup, just in case you're waking up, because they wake up a little late  in, let's see, they wake up late in Buffalo.  Ah, okay, good.  They're just waking up in Buffalo.  On Friday, we told everyone that Jim Norton got arrested for picking up a tranny, and the 
[00:51:00]  problem was that Jimmy was on a plane to Vegas, where, by the way, Jimmy, I heard you killed  in Vegas.  Yeah, a lot of very good fan, I couldn't believe how many ONA fans are there.  I could not believe the ONA fan representation.  Great.  I had a very cool moment at Comic Relief, which I'll tell you about.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  I'll tease that for later.  I wasn't watching Billy Crystal.  I was going to say that.  I saw part of that.  We have audio for later. 
[00:51:30]  Strap on your douche chill belts.  It's really bad.  Hey, man, he does his Jazzman character.  Stop it.  I think he did it for like 20 straight minutes.  Enough already.  Boring.  So Jimmy was flying.  He touches down to Vegas, and Kenny turns on his phone, and Kenny has just a ton of voicemails,  mostly from Jim's dad and then Jim's sister.  Yeah.  They're all panicking.  They believe that Jimmy was arrested.  Yeah.  On Friday.  And then Jimmy had to call home immediately, and he had to talk to a sobbing mom. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, because I wanted to wish her a happy birthday.  I'm like, I'll just tell mom that there's no big deal, and I got to wish her a happy birthday anyway,  so I'll call up and say happy birthday, and, you know, clear this up.  I didn't realize it was a big deal.  I figured, like, ah, she'd go, oh, no, we kind of figured.  But she didn't say that.  She said, so you didn't get arrested?  Like, she almost didn't believe it.  I'm like, no.  And she's like, are you sure everything's okay?  Like, I was like, mom, my girlfriend, and Kenny, I was on a plane to Vegas.  I'm in Vegas.  Oh, no.  They were saying that you got, they were saying. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, it was awful.  And you pulled up in a car, and a girl was in it, and it was a man.  Karen handled.  Karen handled Henry Hill's arrest better than my mother handled this.  Mom, that's all you had.  I love it, man.  Actually, Jimmy loved it, too.  I did, too, because it wasn't done to make my parents upset.  But it's like, stop listening to this show.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, I know.  Hey, by the way.  Our parents should not listen.  By the way, because we're all over the place, we will get the voicemails on.  What do you guys think?  Should they air the OJ special?  Yes, of course they should.  Yeah, yeah, everything with OJ.  All OJ all the time, the OJ channel.  The boycott is growing.  Yeah, well, you know what?  And I've got to real quick defend this, Judith Regan.  They printed Hitler's stuff, and Mein Kampf is still sold.  She has every right to interview him as a journalist.  So you're trying to go from one end of the spectrum to the other here?  Well, I mean, you know, come on.  They interview people. 
[00:53:30]  Should HBO be in trouble for interviewing the Iceman who murdered people?  They interview killers all the time and air it.  Who's protesting?  This looks more like, because say what you want about Mein Kampf, when Hitler wrote it, it was truly his beliefs.  And I don't think he was doing it for cash.  I think this was the raving rantings of a lunatic.  I think the problem people have with this is it is just blatant exploitation of two dead people. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I understand that.  But what is the news?  You're not going to get an argument from me out of that, but people are bamboozled with the news.  What is going on with the media, though?  I mean, why not?  You should be able to show all this stuff.  Absolutely.  When do we start getting morals in the media?  You should be able to interview him.  It's all fake morality.  Judith Regan is doing nothing wrong by talking to him.  And if you don't like it, just don't watch it.  Don't watch.  Don't tell us we can't watch, because I want to watch it.  And if you don't watch, you'll hear the clips on this very program.  And obviously, he's not getting paid for this, right? 
[00:54:30]  Or do they find some kind of loophole around?  There's some discrepancy with where the money's going.  Judith Regan is under the impression, the publisher, because she's taken all kinds of heat now for paying him, supposedly,  that there's an intermediary that she's paying, and that money was supposed to go to O.J.'s children.  And she wanted this to happen because she had gone through domestic abuse when she was younger.  She had to pull out some kind of story. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  That she had gone through domestic abuse, and this was her way of, like, it was almost like freeing to her,  and that somebody through this tragedy would be being taken care of, O.J.'s children.  I think that's a bunch of crap.  She wrote a great statement, which I read.  And I actually got, like, wow, kind of teary-eyed.  Like, it was really good.  Oh.  And then it lost me.  Mom said she was arrested and called you.  Well, then it lost me.  Because it started off really, like, wow, I was a victim of domestic violence, and it was, like, really moving.  And then I realized, oh, okay, she's just covering her ass.  Like, you don't have to explain. 
[00:55:30]  It was a complete cover, man.  You don't have to explain yourself.  Come on.  You do what you got to do to make it.  I don't care.  Just, why can't people just say what the hell they feel and not come up with excuses and bull crap statements for things that happen?  Like, I just heard we were talking about that.  We'll talk about it more.  Michael Richards using the N-word.  He's having to say N-word in Comedy Club. 
[00:56:00]  He already said, you know, I apologize for that.  Why should anyone apologize?  And how come now Judith Regan's got to put out a statement apologizing?  Why can't you just come out and say, look, this guy wanted to put this book out.  There is a huge clamor for it.  People are going to – this thing is going to be watched by a lot of people.  The people want to see it.  Why do I have to make an excuse?  And just to add to that, why couldn't you just go on and say, look, I figured out a way to get this guy to confess.  Yeah.  Look at me. 
[00:56:30]  Look at how brilliant I am.  Something the courts couldn't do.  Right.  Stupid prosecution couldn't do.  I did it.  Why couldn't she do that?  Because it's not politically correct.  Who gives a crap?  How about this?  If you don't want to read it, don't read it.  If you don't want to watch it, don't watch it.  You don't understand.  People are apologizing to such a small minority all the time.  The majority of people don't care.  They do not care about things.  If you put out an apology statement, if they like you, they're going to still like you and watch what you do or listen to what you're saying or do whatever business you're in. 
[00:57:00]  It's the small minority, these small groups of people that write letters that you're apologizing to.  So don't apologize.  And the reality is just about every person out there loves this type of stuff.  Of course they do.  Everyone wants to hear how O.J. did it out of O.J.'s mouth.  The trial was watched more than any other trial in history.  Stop it.  People are still talking about it.  They love it.  And Geraldo.  They love it.  Geraldo Rivera is on the boycott wagon. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, Geraldo's a jackass.  It's like, Geraldo, I'm looking at him right now on TV.  You really don't want to see this special?  You're a liar.  Mr. Al Capone's vault.  Yeah, Al Capone, by the way, who was a murderer.  Yeah.  Al Capone, you want to talk about a guy that committed crimes?  Why was it okay to walk in and look for the possessions of a guy who murdered people for a living?  Why was that acceptable?  Get the promos for that.  Like, I remember the promos for that.  It's like, what will we find when we tear down this wall into Al Capone's vault? 
[00:58:00]  And one of the things was, will it be some of the bodies of his victims that he's pushing it like you might see dead people?  Well, 60 Minutes, Ed Bradley, Dan Rather, all these major journalists have interviewed Saddam Hussein.  They've interviewed Bin Laden.  They've interviewed all these guys.  If they could have gotten Al Zarqawi, they would have interviewed him.  Why is that acceptable?  But you can't ask OJ just because white people, and look, I'm one of them, didn't like the fact that he got away with it.  And that's the reality.  Jimmy, great point, bud. 
[00:58:30]  You said Ed Bradley.  He's dead.  Good luck, bro.  I was trying to throw in a...  Please leave him alone.  He's dead now.  You know, your Ed Bradley dead bit is stupid.  It's got no payoff.  Jimmy's 100% right, though.  It's ridiculous.  They interview guys...  And now they're discussing this all morning on Good Morning America, and then they're divided at Fox now because Shepard Smith's like, I won't see that.  Oh, that douche.  Why doesn't he shut up?  Hey, Shep, run over another newswoman in a parking lot.  Exactly.  Why don't you?  Squash those floating rumors. 
[00:59:00]  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  We all know what everybody's saying about you, you silver-haired little fruit.  Drop dead.  Shepard Smith?  No, that's the other guy.  Oh, sorry.  I meant the other guy.  I don't mean you.  I mean somebody else.  Holy crap.  Jim Norton said that.  Jim Norton said that.  Jim Norton said it.  Jim Norton.  Send all your lawsuits to Jim Norton.  For what?  Saying there's a rumor circulating?  There was.  Ah, Shep loves us.  There is a rumor circulating, but it's with the other guy.  I'm sorry.  He just can't say it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I meant Anderson Cooper. 
[00:59:30]  Well, I'm not saying.  Why?  There's rumors going around.  Are there rumors about Anderson Cooper's sexual preference?  Yes, there are.  I have not heard any of these.  I've heard a bunch of them.  Yeah, there's a lot.  Yes, I've heard them.  Really?  Yes, on a daisy chain with other gentlemen, I was told.  I have not heard anything but manly stuff about him.  Do you see what a jerk I am, how fast I just believe the rumor?  I am.  And pin it on the wrong guy.  And not only do I believe the rumor, I angrily use it.  You played pin the c*** on the homo and missed. 
[01:00:00]  I know.  I pinned it on the wrong cheek.  Jesus.  You know, Matt from Jersey makes a good point.  Let's go to Matt really fast and then let's go to Cigars and Scotch after that.  Matt, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Geraldo and O'Reilly, they're all mad and protesting just because they weren't the ones who got the interview.  There you go.  Do you think if O.J. came up to Geraldo and said,  I want to do an interview with you, Geraldo, and I want to do this whole thing on, 
[01:00:30]  I didn't kill my ex-wife and her friend, but if I did, I would have done it this way.  Do you think Geraldo would have turned around and said, no, I won't do that.  Geraldo, the guy that every night backed Michael Jackson because Michael Jackson was giving Geraldo exclusive interviews.  Oh, I forgot about that.  On a nightly basis, this guy backed a friggin' pedophile, a kid-toucher,  admitted to sleeping with children in his bed, 
[01:01:00]  and there's a mountain of evidence against him, but for some reason he keeps sliding,  but backed him every night of the week, would take phone calls,  but this one, he's got a problem with.  And how many interviews have you seen with Manson?  How many Charles Manson interviews have you seen?  I thought you meant Marilyn.  Oh, no, Marilyn's good.  Enjoyed his music.  Is it a boy?  Is it a girl?  Send you out to me.  You know what?  Don't need cigars and scotch anymore.  Thanks.  Charles Manson. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, is that his point?  Yeah, well, Geraldo interviewed.  Geraldo interviewed Manson.  Oh, I didn't know Geraldo did it.  Oh, how about that?  But Manson was convicted of orchestrating something that not only did they commit complete random murders,  but one of them was Sharon Tate, who was pregnant.  She was like eight months pregnant, and they sliced her open.  Yeah.  So the barbarism of those, don't stop.  Stop being self-righteous.  People don't like it.  Where's this fake morality?  Who cares?  It's phony morality is what it is.  Everybody, and what they do is they want to inject themselves into the story. 
[01:02:00]  Well, it's really interesting because Good Morning America, that's what I'm seeing right now.  They're talking about the boycott.  Should we boycott this thing?  But if Good Morning America, it's kind of going with your point.  If they got the exclusive, then they would be all about that.  And then it would be Fox News Channel and everyone else saying, well, should we see this?  We've got to boycott this.  It all depends who got the interview.  And then you'd take a different slant on it.  I think Fox is the one starting the boycott rumors.  I was just going to say that this is probably a gimmick, like frigging wrestling in Fox's newsertainment. 
[01:02:30]  It's not even real news.  I wouldn't doubt that they pit different journalists' personalities on Fox News against this whole thing and each other to build the hype.  Like, all right, Geraldo, Shepard Smith, you guys, you ain't buying it?  No, they all got – their egos are so big over there, they can't work together. 
[01:03:00]  They all want to be the man.  They all want to be the guy that got the exclusive with OJ.  I think they want – because it's going to air on Fox News, right?  Yeah.  The interview.  So I think to be company guys, the company line on this one is we want some of the people to be against this to build the hype.  I don't know.  Or maybe Shepard Smith just got it.  Maybe they just understand what each one is doing and goes, you know, one of us – again, they don't sit down in a room and say – maybe they just get it.  I won't be watching this.  It just gets people talking.  Shepard Smith had gotten in an argument with some other journalist over a parking space in Florida years ago, and he wound up getting arrested for it. 
[01:03:30]  And so this woman stood in the parking spot until her vehicle could be pulled in, and Shepard Smith is yelling at her, the bitch, and C-word, and everything else.  And she wouldn't move, and he bumped into her with his car.  Good for him.  Good.  And he got arrested.  His mugshot's hysterical.  That's wonderful.  But that guy – but when you do that – there it is. 
[01:04:00]  There's his mugshot.  But when you do something like that, you pretty much can't really goof on people anymore in the news.  You can't go like, oh, now, stop.  I'm such an idiot.  I just caught myself.  You said he hit a woman with a car, and my first reaction was good.  Good.  He should.  Let's go to Barry in Boston.  Barry.  Nothing.  Barry.  Hey there, Barry.  By the way, a great story coming from the Boston Herald today.  The Tee, should they put the brakes on violent video game ads? 
[01:04:30]  They got an ad on the side of the Tee for Vice City, Grand Theft Auto.  So they're up in arms up there because violent video games are being advertised on the side of the Tee's, and they have hookers discussing it.  Hookers.  Yeah, we'll get into that a little later on in the program.  Speaking of that, I saw an ad on the side of one of those buses that go down to Atlantic City over the weekend.  Yeah.  Those giant buses.  It was us. 
[01:05:00]  Took up the entire side of a bus.  Yeah.  I've never seen a bus ad that big in my life.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  For anything.  Was it on the one where the guy had the heart attack?  I don't know.  You read that story over the weekend?  Someone did.  One of the Atlantic City buses, they pull out, I think.  Oh, they're all full of old people.  Was it Brooklyn?  The guy has been a driver for 25 years.  The driver did?  He made the run to Atlantic City numerous times, and they took off.  Everyone's in a good mood and just laughing and just can't wait for their trip to Atlantic City.  Guy drops dead of a heart attack and crashes into a pole. 
[01:05:30]  I don't think anyone else was injured.  Ruined everyone's trip.  66 years old, I believe.  Did he die or just?  Heart attack, dead, on the spot, and the bus keeps going until it hits a pole.  Wow.  That's got to be an odd.  A bunch of old people in there.  Oh, what happened?  But I got to get my coupons.  Yeah.  It's going to be awful when you lean out.  You're in your bus seat, and you lean out to the left, and you look down the aisle,  and you see the driver slumped on the floor, and trees coming at you in the windshield.  Just knowing you're not turning out of the way of those things.  That is just not good. 
[01:06:00]  That's why I can't sleep on a bus.  I can't sleep when someone else is driving.  When was the last time you were on a bus?  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Had to be an event for this show when we were giving out the loud stickers.  Good point.  I'm rich now.  I forgot.  No, I take a bus every once in a while.  Every so often.  The 66-year-old driver suffered a heart attack behind the wheel, causing the bus to crash  into a utility pole in Brooklyn.  The driver is dead, and 26 passengers suffered minor cuts and bruises. 
[01:06:30]  They were taken to area hospitals.  Oh, the dude from Boston, he couldn't even wait anymore.  He's like, when are you going to play Jim Norton's?  I know.  He's annoyed with us.  Well, we're just punishing the asses on whack bag a little bit.  After the break, we played Jim Norton's voicemails.  That's right.  And Club Soda Kenny's voicemails.  And not before it.  Well, someone's got to remind me, though, because we're going off on all sorts of tangents.  That tangent was my fault, actually, because I started with the Judith Regan thing.  Your fault. 
[01:07:00]  That was supposed to be a quick, seriously 15 seconds, like, what do you think?  But morality in media, that's a biggie.  Because it's fake morality in media.  Because the media doesn't give a crap.  It's the money angle.  They've got to make believe they care, but they don't.  It's the money angle.  It's the fact that he's never seen any time for it.  Everyone knows he's guilty of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a bunch of factors as to why people are pissed off at this whole thing.  And the media's just pissed because they didn't get the coup.  All right.  He got away with it.  Deal with it.  America. 
[01:07:30]  That's it.  It's, you know, it stinks, but it happens.  And it's been happening forever, and it's always going to happen.  Guys get away with crimes.  Too bad.  That was so obvious, though.  Jesus Christ.  It was so obvious.  If someone gets away with a crime, I want it to be, like, you know, obvious.  I saw a good show over the weekend.  I was watching a bunch of those crime shows, you know, and I called it stupid criminal show.  I go, baby, you got to come in here and watch this.  It's stupid criminal show.  You ever watch the crime shows where they solve the case, and it's like, oh, my God,  these detectives are amazing.  They found a fiber and matches this and that. 
[01:08:00]  This was like dummies.  It was the – each one lasted 15 minutes long, and it was like they found his bloody footprint,  and he showed up at the police station wearing the same sneakers.  The end.  The end.  It was like dummy – that kind of stuff.  That was O.J.  Well –  It was so obvious.  Well, that's better than watching stupid Bigfoot on the travel channel.  No, that's your problem.  Wow.  I'm calling my cable provider, and I'm getting the travel channel taken off my system.  Why?  I love Bigfoot.  Stupid travel channel.  The Sasquatch isn't real. 
[01:08:30]  No.  His big feet.  Oh, dude, I got rooked into watching the Bigfoot special or whatever it was on the travel channel,  thinking they had new evidence and new info.  Oh, same old film clip.  It was the same film clip of the guy on the horse.  Well, they had that, but they failed to mention during this special that looked like it was done only a year ago  that that guy confessed on his deathbed that the video was fake.  Yeah.  Oh, he did confess that, right?  And also, there's a guy who said, I made that costume. 
[01:09:00]  There's a guy out there who actually has a picture of the costume that he made.  Yeah.  I made that.  That's one of the things I'm saying.  Oh, shaky.  Unless I'm mistaken, that's what I heard.  The guy on his deathbed said that the video was fake, but the travel channel, because it wouldn't be a good story,  they just make believe they didn't have that piece of info when this special ran over the weekend.  I don't know if that's true.  I know the surgeon's photo of the Loch Ness Monster, that guy confessed on his deathbed.  That's a very famous photo.  Why don't we take that into the Opie and Anthony lab and try to get some info?  That's a very famous photo.  Bring it to the institute.  Into the institute.  Also, a little later today, hopefully, 
[01:09:30]  Panty Porter!  Panty party, indeed.  We can't get enough of Tyra.  But we're trying.  Dude, I finally saw the entire Panty show.  Did you?  Oh, my God.  It's hilarious.  Stupid Tyra.  We'll get into that as well.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  When we get back, someone remind me to play the voicemails, please.  But it'll be your job, Jimmy.  But I'm about to forget, I guess.  Jimmy's got a job. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  You got a job today, Jimmy.  Okay.  It's the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, coming to the Opie and Anthony Show, Friday, December 1st.  If you have a hankering for rich, creamy, thick holiday eggnog goodness, and a lot of it,  then you need to step up and take the Eggnog Challenge.  For details on how to participate, visit opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com. 
[01:10:30]  It's the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, Friday, December 1st.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you ready?  Yes, we're ready.  Holy ass.  Bo Derrick, 50.  50 years old today.  I remember when she was 10.  Get it?  Get it?  The movie? 
[01:11:00]  Ow.  You're going to have to tase me.  We have more tasing clips, by the way.  Another dog getting tased.  A girl singing Jingle Bells.  And a girl singing Happy Birthday and then getting tased in the middle of it.  A happy birthday tasing?  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, maybe we could do this real fast in honor of Bo Derrick.  Is that a new thing?  Like getting girls to sing and then tase them? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  That's why YouTube is the greatest invention ever.  It's making people do things.  Ever.  Like tasing videos are huge.  You know, anchors screwing up.  You know how people want to be famous?  A lot of people have this want to be famous.  YouTube is giving them that outlet, but they're going through what we had to go through in radio over our career.  They're having to top that last big thing, which we found out how that always ends. 
[01:12:00]  Tragically and unemployed is one way.  I truly believe something's going to happen and people will start dying to be on YouTube.  I'm sure it's happened already.  Already?  Look into it, yeah.  By the way, to every other radio guy out there, beat what we did.  Beat it.  Oh.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  Oh, wow.  No one's ever beating that one.  Happy birthday to you. 
[01:12:30]  Well, she should have been tased.  Why?  That was a stun gun, huh?  Yeah.  That's nice.  Where did they hit her?  She goes on the way.  That's the latest rage.  Where'd they hit her?  Hold on.  Yeah, go ahead, Danny.  They were hitting this girl everywhere.  Like, she wouldn't go down?  Well, no, she did, and then she'd get back up and they'd do it again.  Wow.  There was this one clip, unfortunately there's really no audio, of this one girl, she's taking 
[01:13:00]  a sip of a drink, and then another girl tases her in the throat.  Oh, God.  She's drinking it.  It's actually pretty funny.  What the hell, man?  It's one of the latest rages on YouTube, though.  I think it's labeled hot chicks singing and getting tased or something like that.  Well, of course it's labeled that.  Yeah.  This was all part of one huge video.  It's actually the original clip that you guys have of the Sweet Home Alabama.  It's actually part of that original video.  Right.  It's the same girl getting tased over and over again.  And it's just getting girls to sing and then tasing them or stun gunning them. 
[01:13:30]  Well, we'll play the dog one.  Might as well.  Here's a dog getting tased.  Saw the video of this, too.  It's pretty funny.  The dog is so out of it when he stands up.  You see when it's a big-headed, like, pit bull or something, and they tase him.  And he goes down, and he's on his side twitching.  And then he stands up, and he's leaning against an open door, and his eyes are fluttering.  And he's just shaking.  You feel so bad for the poor guy.  Why'd they tase him? 
[01:14:00]  He was apparently in the house when they were trying to get this guy out of the house.  And they started getting the guy out the door, and the dog was barking.  And I guess made an aggressive kind of stance or movement toward the officer, and they tased him.  But, boy, a dog getting tased, same as the person.  They sit there and shake and start being very agreeable.  Ant was doing this brand-new taser bid on Friday.  It was beyond hilarious.  Was that what the guy?  It's the showstopper.  It's just the way a taser makes anyone cooperate and will make – 
[01:14:30]  No matter what.  No matter how adamant you are about your stance in politics or life or global warming, whatever it is,  it'll change instantly once you get it.  Because it's usually a group of people, and one guy's instigating it.  No, man, you have no authority here.  You think that you're a cop?  You could come in here and bust us up?  We're hanging, man.  We're hanging here because we have a right to stay here and voice our opinion. 
[01:15:00]  Okay, I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  Don't do that again.  He just – in a second.  I actually heard that Friday on the way to the hotel.  We were listening to the show.  In Vegas?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was very funny.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  That jackass in the library who got a good take, deservedly so.  Shut your book and leave.  Hey, let's say hi to Vegas, too, this morning.  Yeah, what's up, Vegas?  Hey, Vegas.  And just by the way, to wrap this thing up, the photo that I was correcting, it was the 
[01:15:30]  surgeon's photo that was faked.  They never confessed to faking the Bigfoot footage.  Oh, really?  The footage.  No, it was the surgeon's photo.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's right.  I got the two stories mixed up.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't, too.  And we have audio to play.  You told me to remind you.  I do my job.  Of what?  Oh, the dog getting tased, yes.  Oh, we already have that.  Show your hands.  Show your hands.  Give me your paw.  Come to me.  Come to the door.  Walk outside.  Come to me.  Turn.  Walk outside. 
[01:16:00]  Turn around.  Okay.  Turn the f*** around.  Oh, please don't, please.  Put your hands on your hands.  Put your hands on your hands.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He won't hurt you.  He won't hurt you.  Please.  Got him?  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  You guys can't get a pass out of me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Let's go.  Let's go. 
[01:16:30]  Put your ass back inside the house.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And that was the little shelter.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's how you train a dog not to make on the rug.  Right.  That's awful.  Isn't that amazing how much worse you feel as a person when that happens to a dog than you do when it happens to a person?  Oh, absolutely.  Like the dog, you kind of hear him whining, and you're like, oh, the poor guy.  But people, you're like, ah, look at this ass. 
[01:17:00]  Good.  All right.  Finally, we got voicemails to play from Kenny's phone and Jimmy's phone.  The deal on Friday, Jimmy was flying to Vegas, and he killed in Vegas.  Nothing but great reports from Vegas about Jimmy.  And we decided, what the hell, we'll tell everyone that Jimmy got arrested for trying to pick up a tranny in the meatpacking district here in New York City.  A lot of people, I would say more than half, bought into the bit. 
[01:17:30]  Whackbag, a few of the people had to blow it up for everybody, which I just don't understand.  And someone, I think it was Bill, is saying, look, man, we had to do something because it crashed the website.  I'm sorry for ruining the Jimmy in jail bit on Whackbag by starting the topic, but Whackbag crashed, and people really are stupid out there.  You don't even know.  And by the way, as far as your percentages, you're wrong.  The percentage that you believe is fired.  It comes to parents, 100%.  Yeah.  Parents and sisters, 100% across the board. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, so then hook, line, and sinker.  Jimmy lands, he had no idea because we didn't tell him we were doing this.  So, you know, he turns his phone back on.  He's got messages.  Kenny's got messages.  Kenny's like, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, blah, blah, blah.  And then Jimmy had to call home and had to talk to a very, very sad mom.  She was stricken mother of the day after her birthday.  I have not heard the Kenny messages.  That was the first one we played.  Okay.  Kenny got other messages, too.  So here we go.  Here are the messages left on Kenny's phone from Jim's dad.  Hey, Ken, it's Jim. 
[01:18:30]  Jim Norton again.  I don't know if my last message got.  If I left a message, I don't know if it got through.  And I'm just calling about Jimmy.  We've been listening to the radio.  And, you know, I told you, his mom's upset.  She heard something about him being arrested or something.  So he just wants to know what was going on, if he's okay, and if he needs anything.  So when you get a moment to call back, let us know everything's okay.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Talk to you later.  Bye-bye.  If I need what?  Like a pillow device?  You need anything. 
[01:19:00]  You know what that reminded me of?  The voice.  And if you need anything and everything.  What was that?  Midnight Express?  When the father comes and visits.  Oh, yeah.  Remember the guy that had the hashish strap come?  And the father comes and he's trying to hold it together.  And he goes, got you, you know, some clothes and these cigarettes.  And God damn it.  Why?  What?  Jimmy's parents.  You know what's great about your dad there?  He doesn't want to acknowledge what you got arrested for. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Just that you got arrested.  Just that.  What do you need?  He's not going to mention what it was.  Just by the shower.  Filthy animal.  That was the second one.  The first one we really couldn't hear.  We played it a little earlier this morning.  Here's the third one.  Hey, Ken.  It's Jim's dad again.  I'm in the car going up to see my daughter.  And I won't be home, but I don't know what happened.  You know, I heard on the show about it.  I'd like to message earlier.  But one way or the other, if you get a minute, let me know. 
[01:20:00]  Because, you know, it's upsetting.  But, you know, Gail was really upset about it.  You know, about what happened.  So give me a buzz.  I'm going to have my show with me.  Thanks, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  When did they finally find out that it was just a hoax?  When I talked to them.  Many hours later?  Yeah.  Did your family have an intervention when they watched Lucky Louie with you about drugs and owning guns and things like that?  Did they watch Lucky Louie and go, oh, my God, Jimmy's got a gun. 
[01:20:30]  We're very upset.  He shouldn't have that.  No, it's a TV show.  He's wearing a robe.  I think he's selling pot to children.  Let's say hi to Doug out, Doug.  Doug, what's up?  Hey, I don't know if it worked or not, but, Anthony, I tried to forward you a couple of the messages I got on MySpace from the world's dumbest fan base.  They were all messaging me, asking me if I heard about Jimmy, if he's okay, if he was released.  Really? 
[01:21:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, there were a lot of people buying it.  That's cool.  Yeah, good to know.  As someone that runs a fan site for the show, thank you for the traffic.  Yeah.  You're welcome, sweetie.  Doug, what's yours?  FBA?  How do we do it on this side?  I forget.  OAExperience.com.  OAExperience.com.  There you go.  All right, thank you, Doug.  Later, boys.  All right, now we get into Jimmy's voicemail.  Didn't my sister leave him one?  You want to go there first?  Whatever the order was, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  I don't know what the order was.  It would be very odd.  Yeah.  They put it in this order.  Oh, whatever the order they put in there.  I did it, man.  It's fine.  Yeah, I guess we're going to end with your sister, maybe.  Okay, yeah, whatever.  Someone decided on that.  All right, so this is Jimmy's voicemail.  Jimmy's father calling Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hey, Jim, it's Jeff.  I just wanted to know how you doing.  It's, uh...  Oh, God.  All casual.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, just call.  How you doing?  You doing okay?  You know, you've been eating healthy.  Did you get arrested for trying to solicit sex with a man in the dress?  Yeah.  All well?  Just curious? 
[01:22:00]  Heard something on the radio about it.  No, he's not even acknowledging that yet.  No, no.  I don't think he wants to.  Just seeing how you're doing.  Just hoping he was going to get your live voice.  Throwing some feelers out there.  Right.  Just to see how things are.  Just a couple feelers.  How you doing?  Hey, uh...  Hey, Jim, it's Jeff.  I just wanted to know how you're doing.  It's Friday, and we're listening to the show.  And somebody said something about you being arrested, and we're not sure if it's part  of the show or if you did, but we're trying to find out what's going on.  Oh.  We haven't heard anything yet, but if you need anything, give us a call, okay? 
[01:22:30]  And let us know what's going on.  Stitches.  We'll see you later, kiddo.  We love you.  Bye.  We love you.  We love you.  We love you.  Because I'm your father.  You pervert convict.  We love you, you little moe.  You little gentleman in a dress chasing moe.  Wink, wink.  We love you.  We love you.  Noogies.  All right.  Oh, that is horrid.  Those are the messages you want to get when you get off that plane.  No.  We've got a few more.  Yes, we do.  It keeps going. 
[01:23:00]  So then Jimmy didn't call his father back, so then he has to call again.  Hey, James.  It's your father.  We're going to see your sister now.  We've got a couple of things to do.  We're listening to the show.  I left a couple of messages for Kenny, and I left one for you before.  But if anything's going on, please give us a call and let us know when you can.  Oh, he's getting worried and desperate.  I've got my own thoughts on it, but let us know what's happening.  What does he mean by that?  I don't know.  You're his son?  I actually don't know.  I got my own thoughts on it. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, boy.  You freak of nature.  Either I should have kicked her in the stomach in 1968.  That might have been a thought.  You're an embarrassment.  I'm sure that was a thought.  I got my own thoughts on that.  I remember the time, Christmas 1972.  I left you alone with Uncle Sam in the other room while we were trying to prepare the turkey.  I hope it's not.  I got my own thoughts on it.  I've made a similar mistake.  Yeah.  We could commiserate.  Right.  I got my own thoughts on it, but let us know what's happening, you know, about the jail or whatever or arrested. 
[01:24:00]  And call me on myself and let me make sure.  We want to just make sure you're okay.  All right?  Love you, kiddo.  Bye-bye.  God, your parents love you.  No matter what.  Just the way he was casual about it.  He goes, you know, about the jail.  About the jail thing?  About the whole thing.  Yeah, that thing.  What was I calling about?  No, I forgot.  All right, the jail thing.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  Well, then Jim's sister gets involved.  So your father called Kenny, called you, your mom's crying, and now it's Jim's sister on Kenny's voicemail.  Hey, Kenny.  It's Tracy, Jim's sister.  It's 12.05 in the afternoon.  I'm just calling.  I heard that Jimmy was arrested to make sure that he was okay.  Just give me a call.  I know, you know, that if he was arrested, you'd probably run around crazy and, you know, some major's going on.  But if you happen to get a chance, just so I at least know he's okay, if you can give me a call. 
[01:25:00]  Thanks, Kenny.  Bye.  Oh, they're so worried about you.  Wow.  Meanwhile, I was living the high life on the plane.  You're having a cinnamon roll.  On your way to Vegas.  Hey, it's better than, you know, landing in Vegas and having no voicemails.  Oh, absolutely.  Realizing that your family could give a crap.  Yeah, one for my dad.  Nice job, faggot.  Click.  And finally, Jim's sister calls Jimmy's voicemail. 
[01:25:30]  Hey, Jim, it's your sister.  It's noon.  Just calling.  I heard you were arrested.  Just calling to make sure everything's okay.  Give me a call whenever you can so I know you're all right.  Love you.  Bye.  Aw, they love you.  Aren't they lovely?  She just wants to trade, like, makeup tips and other things with another girl now.  Yeah, she's going to throw these underwear out, but she's a friend that could use them.  Fellow sister.  Just talk sister talk.  How big do you like them? 
[01:26:00]  So that's what I got to happen when I landed in Vegas.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Your family was very concerned.  Jimmy enjoyed it, though.  Oh, it was very funny, yeah, of course.  Jimmy definitely enjoyed it.  Did you get that kind of attention when you were really arrested for the show?  Oh, yeah, I'm sure I did.  I don't remember.  Yeah?  I'm sure I did, yeah.  Yeah.  All those calls?  Yeah, I didn't think to say that.  Did your mommy cry?  I don't remember.  I don't think so.  I just don't know.  Yeah.  I don't remember.  Block that out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I had enough to deal with on this new... 
[01:26:30]  I think since we came back on XM, I think that's when, you know, she's had a lot to deal  with.  Yeah.  What's wrong with him?  Yeah.  I wonder if my parents ever just, like, well, my name will come up somewhere, and I wonder  if they're able to just, like, turn their heads and make eye contact and then turn  it away real quick.  Oh, no.  Yeah, because with FM radio, you know, there were some subjects we couldn't even touch on  and weave a little story around FCC rules or anything. 
[01:27:00]  There were just some things that could never be discussed.  And with XM, we were able to just say whatever we want, and Jimmy went full bore.  I went higher.  You certainly did.  He went...  For the first few months, we learned a lot about Jimmy.  He went all in.  Yep.  All in.  I'm all in.  He didn't hold any chips back.  Yeah.  All in.  And his parents had to hear some of that, and oof.  All right.  We should take a break.  Right.  We've got to get into...  Penny party! 
[01:27:30]  Penny party!  Wake up with whoopee!  Penny party!  Woo!  Yeah.  We have to talk about the penny party and other things.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we're trying to figure out what to do next. 
[01:28:00]  Lots to do today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning, by the way.  Hope you had a great weekend.  I had a cool thing happen.  Yeah?  When I was out.  Yeah, I called you about it, but I wanted to sit on the air.  I was in the comic relief tent while kind of watching the show from backstage and talking  to people.  Oh, when you called me from back there, I couldn't hear it.  Crap!  Oh, okay.  I heard Jerry, uh...  Jerry Connell.  Right.  Is that his name or O'Connell?  Or O'Connell.  I don't even know. 
[01:28:30]  And...  I'm such a pop culture idiot.  I know who he is.  And something about the show.  That's all I know.  I walk in to do press.  They asked me, HBO said, do you want to do some press?  They actually took me through the press junket.  I was right behind Ray Romano.  It was...  I had to do Entertainment Tonight.  They'll never use a word of what I said.  It was just me in a Kiss shirt wearing my stupid...  And, you know...  Ray Romano and Ray Romano?  Did I say...  Oh, yeah.  I said it twice a little.  A little call back if you were listening a couple of days ago.  And, uh...  I'm on my way to do this press.  And, uh...  And Jerry grabs me.  And he goes, Jim Norton.  He goes, dude, I'm sorry. 
[01:29:00]  I go, I'm Jerry O'Connell.  I'm an actor.  And I knew who he was.  Of course you know who he is, yeah.  And he goes, dude, I'm such a huge fan of the show.  He's a massive Opie and Anthony fan.  I'm a real fan.  Not like one who heard it once while driving to the airport.  Really?  He's a real fan of the show.  And Jonathan, my manager, talked to him.  Because I was being...  You know how when you're doing a press junket...  Sometimes you're being...  I said, Jerry, I'll get back to you.  Because I was being whisked away.  And, uh...  You were not.  You were trying to get somebody to snap a picture.  Oh, I was so...  I was so shame-filled when the woman... 
[01:29:30]  The HBO publicist said,  Do you want to do press?  And I'm like,  Will they ask me questions?  She goes, yes.  I submitted your name.  They all want to talk to you.  I'm like, are you sure?  So I had this nightmare of just going,  Hi, guys.  And standing there and hearing one camera go...  Click.  And then nothing else.  So I...  Then she was actually moving me along.  But yeah, he's a...  Jonathan talked to her.  He's a really big fan.  How cool is that?  That's cool.  And he wants to come on the show.  He definitely wants to do the show.  He is welcome.  And, uh...  Anytime, man.  Yeah, a lot of them seem to be fans of the show.  And I was such a dirty bird  talking about, like, Vegas and hookers 
[01:30:00]  and all that stuff.  It was a Katrina thing.  And instead of talking about Katrina...  Because the press,  a lot of them were, like, fans  and, like, really weird.  So I'm having a good time  talking to them about prostitution  and all this stuff.  Believe me,  that's how everyone felt.  No one cares about the Katrina thing.  The publicist is trying to hustle me along  because the two guys behind me  are the two husbands  from Desperate Housewives,  which I wouldn't have known  these two swarthy douches  if I bumped into them  in a rest area,  which is where they look like  they belong.  And I've never seen  that awful show.  So I'm between two, like,  legitimately famous entities 
[01:30:30]  and just being a creep.  And I'm on Entertainment Tonight  talking about Pat O'Brien  and Betsy,  and they just,  they hated me.  They really wanted nothing  to do with me.  Because I'm like,  oh, he's not on your show?  I didn't know who your show was.  Why can't they just give us  all that audio  so we can play it on our show?  Yeah.  Jimmy doing the press junket,  that would be just a great thing  to check out.  I love hearing that.  Because they're not going to use  any of that stuff, unfortunately.  Why would they?  You know,  it would be entertaining  for the same old drivel  that you get  from those entertainment shows.  Garbage. 
[01:31:00]  Garbage.  Billy Crystal  as the Jazzman character.  I mean,  you know.  What can I tell you?  This is...  We don't know comedy.  Ridiculous.  Billy Crystal knows comedy.  Look,  Billy Crystal,  there was a point  where Billy Crystal  was funny.  I can't quite  pin the years down,  but there was a point.  You look marvelous.  I liked a few  of his characters  on SNL.  You could call it,  you know,  hack or say  that wasn't funny, 
[01:31:30]  but he was popular  on SNL back then.  You know,  think back.  Maybe those were the years.  I don't know,  but this,  this is so bad  that when I came in  this morning,  Stan had to tell me  about it,  and actually,  he had to write  an email about it  last night.  It was so bad.  As it was happening,  he had to commiserate,  and then he played  a little bit for me  this morning  in the office,  and I can't look  at anybody  while it's playing.  I can't look. 
[01:32:00]  It is so douche-chill  embarrassing.  Alone,  you're embarrassed.  How do you get  embarrassed by yourself  listening to something?  We were,  I was in the tent  when he did this.  It was right outside  the venue.  It's where all the performers  came to hang out  and whatever,  and I didn't see him  or Robin Webby.  They kind of stayed  backstage,  but this came on.  I saw Billy Crystal  walk out on the screen  like everybody else did,  and I'm like,  what is he doing?  And he was doing  like this jazz character,  but it was going on  for a while.  He's done this. 
[01:32:30]  He's done this  in the past.  It's the impression  he does of the  old black jazz man.  Yeah,  you know,  and he squints his eyes  and he rolls his nose up  and shows his front teeth  and talks about the blues  and how hard it was  to grow up as a black man  and you're missing  the black face  if you're going to do  a minstrel show.  You're missing  the burnt piece of cork  to rub on your face  because in essence,  that's what he's doing 
[01:33:00]  and it goes on forever.  He has a legitimate connection  to the music somehow.  I forget the story,  but he was a kid.  His family was involved  with the music,  Big Heavy Tom.  He knew Billie Holiday  when he was a kid.  Jew.  Oh yeah,  definitely Jew.  He has no connection  to that aside from  feeling bad.  No, no, no,  Mel Gibson.  I mean,  it was like a lifelong  love of the music.  I'm not doubting  you could love the music,  but this guy  is the furthest thing  from anybody  that's a jazz singer 
[01:33:30]  or a player  or anything.  What does Billy Crystal know?  I'm missing something on it.  I'm missing something.  Like,  it's missing something  and it's like,  I don't need to do it.  You want to listen  to a little bit of this?  No,  let me tell you something.  I don't want to listen  to a second of this crap,  but yeah,  I have to hear all of it.  To our listeners,  we're not playing this  because it's good.  No,  I want everyone  to be as annoyed  and embarrassed. 
[01:34:00]  Because sometimes  we've got to like,  you know,  explain things to you guys.  And this is cut up.  How long was it then?  It went on for like  10 minutes.  I had to cut it up.  It's 11 minutes  and 30 seconds.  11.30 he did this.  Billy,  11 minutes?  11 minutes,  30 seconds  and it seems like  an eternity.  It seems twice that long  because it's that bad.  Well,  let's take a listen.  And he doesn't even  get into the guy.  I've seen him do this before  on like the first  comic relief.  He did the same thing  and he doesn't even put  the oomph  into the character anymore. 
[01:34:30]  Like,  he used to really  try to sound like...  Now it's like  the Jewish black guy voice.  He's out of touch.  Here's what you need  in your life.  That's what happens.  They get out of touch.  You need people in your life  who will just go,  what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Out that.  Hey,  thanks.  It's not,  you're not being poignant.  You're being a bore.  Here we go.  I grew up in New Orleans.  I have lived in the ninth ward  most of my trade,  cool life.  My father,  he was in the army. 
[01:35:00]  He was a trumpet player.  Don't look at me.  In the army band.  And he also played the bugle.  He was a good bugle player.  I mean,  he could play that bugle.  When he played taps,  you know that the cat  that was dead  meant something to somebody.  I mean,  he played it like  it was the blues.  You're like,  bop do dwee,  bop do zah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Stop.  I'm tapping out.  I'm tapping out.  I'm tapping out  at the bop zooe.  I want more.  Where he's,  he's scatting. 
[01:35:30]  Oh,  stop it.  At least the scat I like  has a payoff.  Do zappa,  do zappa,  do zappa.  Oh,  stop.  When I was old enough,  I wanted to play the horn.  You know,  I went up to my dad  and I said,  pops,  I want to be a musician.  And he said to me,  let's shut up.  You're a fat little Jew.  If you want to be a musician,  play the clarinet,  not the trumpet.  I said,  why,  pop?  He said,  hey,  look at my lip.  You see that little dent  over my lip?  And then you get all this 
[01:36:00]  callus and stuff.  And I'm telling you,  boy,  the chicks don't like to kiss  the trumpet players.  So I took one look at that lip  and that's when I became  a clarinet player.  Can you dig that?  Why are they laughing?  I knew that she could.  Can you dig that?  I knew that she could.  He says that 81 times  during this bit.  Does he really?  He just keeps saying it  and saying it  and saying it.  Can I break in?  It wasn't even funny  when Tony Manero did it  to that whore 
[01:36:30]  that had all of his friends  in the backseat of the car.  Yeah.  Diane in Connecticut,  go ahead.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to let you know  that Jimmy is right.  Billy's dad and uncle  owned a record store  and they were also producers.  Yeah.  There you go.  The business end of jazz.  Stop it.  I'm only saying,  my point was only.  What a Jewish guy  is in a business end.  Exactly.  My point was only that  it's not something  he just grabbed  like as a love.  It was something  that I think  he legitimately grew up loving. 
[01:37:00]  When he was a kid,  he needed his family  to do Billy.  I think it's something  he loved his whole life.  I just don't like the character.  I'm not even going to try  to defend it.  Go ahead.  Play it.  I think the point  Jimmy's trying to make  is that they both  have the same managers  and Jimmy thinks  that Billy Crystal  is terrific.  Exactly.  Wrong.  That he's just terrific.  Wrong.  I don't like the character.  I really don't.  I almost like it.  Almost the legitimacy  of loving the music  almost makes me  dislike this character more  because you shouldn't  be doing something  connected to something 
[01:37:30]  you love so much  and making everyone  who listens to it  go,  uncomfortable.  If what you're saying  is the case  and I have no reason  to doubt you,  this is like showing off then.  He's almost showing off  look how cultured I am.  Look what I know about.  I'm Jewish  yet I know all about  the black man  and jazz  and the blues  and what makes black people  sing and play the blues. 
[01:38:00]  You know something?  Stop it.  You don't.  This is a minstrel show.  All right.  Listen,  we're going to get back  into the audio in a second  but, you know,  breaking news.  Oh, no.  When it happens,  it's got to be run into us  immediately.  It's here on the  Opie and Anthony show  where you get all your  hard-hitting news.  And Sam is on top of it.  Mike Woods.  With my camera.  Mike Woods in the  Nintendo store  flubbing every other word  as he tries to get  to the weather.  All right.  Thank God.  We have been watching 
[01:38:30]  Mike Woods for years now.  Mike Woods does  the local weather  here on Channel 5,  Fox 5, is it?  Yeah, 5.  On Fox 5.  And he is a boob.  Absolutely.  All I can say.  He does the weather  but they like to  interact with him.  Well, they want their  morning TV personalities  to have some improv skills.  Some personality.  That's the latest thing  and Mike Woods  just doesn't have it.  Well, they set Mike  up at this store  where they're selling  the Wii.  They're selling  the Wii. 
[01:39:00]  And that takes  some improv  because he's got to  go from talking  about the Wii  and the people  in the store  to the weather.  He's incapable  of doing that.  And for the rest  of America  he wears suits  that are so tight  it looks like  just before the Hulk  breaks out of his clothes.  Yeah, that's what  he looks like.  He's a big guy.  Let me tell you  he is a big guy.  Like he's muscular.  He could kick  any one of our asses  around the corner  12 times.  The guy really is big. 
[01:39:30]  But I mean  just whenever  he opens his mouth  where something  is supposed to be  improv'd  you just know  it's going to be  hysterically funny  because he hits a wall.  Hasn't it gotten  back to him  that he's being teased?  I hope so.  Awful improv?  You know, Jimmy  I think not only  did it get back to him  now he's in panic mode  every time he's on camera  because he has that  in the back of his head  that we're watching  very closely.  It might be.  There was one point  this morning  we were in the office  we watched  and he was doing  a little repartee 
[01:40:00]  there with the  anchor woman  and he  it was the verbal  equivalent  of driving  into a bridge  abutment.  He went from  yeah, here at the store  weather  today  cold  like couldn't figure out  how to seg something  so he just hit a wall.  What do we got  with this clip?  Well, all he has to do  is say that he's at the store  and what's happening  at the store  which is  Wees are being sold  the Wii  the gaming system  the cute little gaming system 
[01:40:30]  the Wii  he just appears to be  running as fast as he can  to get to the weather  so he can stop talking  yeah, because he's  he's petrified  to open his mouth  he knows he can't say anything  every word  seems to just be  an agonizing experience  yeah, that's it  he just wants to be  put out of his misery  and do the weather  he doesn't want  these hijinks  we're going to cost him  his job  alright, thank you Lucy  let's check in with Mike  now to find out  what's happening  Mike, it's 39 degrees  for goodness sakes  it's cold  it is kind of cold outside 
[01:41:00]  especially, I mean  compared to what we had  last week  definitely chilly  and what are you going to do  that's why we're inside  the Nintendo World Store  out here at Rockefeller Plaza  folks are snapping up  those Wii games  the new video games  that are out  for this holiday season  and it looks like  it's a pretty hot ticket item  let's tell you outside  where there's nothing  high going on at all  we're talking about  cool numbers  snap chin  it's like they're  snapping up  or snatching up  no, I want to make 
[01:41:30]  my own word up  they're snap chin him up  and he looks even  more uneasy  than he sounds  oh, good  I gotta see the video clip  do you still have it?  I'll find it  yeah, I'll watch that later  he's one of our faves  I can't get enough  of that guy  snap chin up  and he's not cold  outside  oh, the poor bastard  back to Billy Crystal  I was 16  when I marched down the street  when my dad come home  from the war  leading his procession 
[01:42:00]  the American flag  draped on his coffin  my mother  my six brothers and sisters  marching behind me  as I strutted up the way  on our way to bring him  to his sleeping place  and I think it's the only time  that taps was ever played  on the clarinet  can you dig that?  I knew that you could  and there was a red painted house  alright, look  I'm getting  I got goosebumps  and not because I'm being touched  are you being moved?  by this  no  not because it's moving  I swear to you  the hairs  just stood up  on the back of my neck  when he said  can you dig it? 
[01:42:30]  I knew you could  I can't listen to this  I cannot sit in this room  and listen to this  see this wouldn't  the house on the corner  this wouldn't be as bad  if it was not being done  I understand  it's a comedy benefit  as attempts to be poignant  but get like an old black actor  like this is the type of thing  I would want to see  an actor doing  like I didn't believe  but it's like  I don't want to see  an older white guy doing this  I want to see  get me like  I don't know  get me Scatman Crothers  if he wasn't dead  or Morgan Freeman  get me the dead one  it's better than this  I want to see 
[01:43:00]  when an axe buried  in his chest recited  what happened  an old jazz musician  to talk?  right  Billy Crystal does not  deliver the visual  of an old jazz musician  sorry  I want to hear  that last line  about could you dig it  again  I'm not trying  to bother you  I  I  I  I  I knew that you could  oh I'm cringing  why  I'm cringing  if the taps  was ever played  on the clarinet  can you dig that  I knew that you could  and there was a red paint  not a peep  right before the cemetery 
[01:43:30]  and every  every time  I would strip by  by the way  someone's saying that  instead of saying  new video games  Mike Woods said  nudio games  nudio games  ooh  wee  every time  I would strip  by the street  right  what a dumb girl  I would see  this beautiful girl  sweet looking dress  on the porch  and she would  smile at me  would she  Billy  and I would smile  back  you know  I ain't stupid  you know  her name was  Marjorie  they're straining  for something  listen to that  hold on  hold on 
[01:44:00]  they are straining  the audience  for anything  to laugh at  anything  so he goes  yeah  I'm not stupid  you hear some  nervous titters  in the background  right there  because they want  to laugh  he's giving them  nothing right here  Billy Crystal's  giving the audience  nothing  that would have  been an acceptable  to me thing to do  stop defending him  no no no  let me finish  if you did it  for 30 seconds  and then intro'd  something  alright  I'll even give you  that 
[01:44:30]  it went on  for 11 minutes  that's the problem  I had with it  it was like a real  long thing  and introduce  an actual jazz musician  that perhaps  lost his friggin house  in Katrina  and talk about  some of his  experiences  and 11 minutes  this is the most  pompous  self-centered  piece of  crap to do  to subject  an audience to  I mean this show  Billy Crystal  thank you  do we have  we have to play  all five clips 
[01:45:00]  yes  no  I want people  to be miserable  I want to hear  more  can you dig that  I knew you could  here we go  her name was  Marjorie Green  what  we've been smiling  at each other  for over 15 years  now  50 years  can you dig that  I knew that you could  is he trying  for a new catchphrase  I think so  that was  Tony Maneros  from Saturday Night Fever  and his friends  Double J  and the other one  well great  can you dig it  I knew that you could 
[01:45:30]  we've been through  a lot of storms  in this house  a lot of storms  so when we heard  about this angry woman  named Katrina  we said that we would stay  even though I know  how hard it is to deal  with an angry woman  can you dig that  I knew that you could  the wind started blowing  real hard  you could feel the house  like standing there  fighting  do you think he's so  out of touch with  what's funny  that he thinks  this is funny  I don't know  what he thinks  what is he trying  for here  it's not comedy  stop it  even Billy Crystal 
[01:46:00]  moving  being moving  and poignant  he's trying to be  poignant  light humor  I don't know  he's trying to be  poignant  I like how  all you can hear  when there's  supposed to be  audience response  is coughing  yeah  and rustling  of papers  you can hear  every little  nuance  going on  in the background  because  there's dead  silence  you hear a lot  of this  while this jackass  is pontificating  in this  black lingo 
[01:46:30]  you need  friends around  you  who are  unafraid of you  enough to smash  you in the face  shut your mouth  Billy what are you  going to be doing  for comic relief  yeah I'm thinking  of doing the  you know the  character I do  the black jazz  musician  it stinks  why would you  do that  well I thought  it would be  memorable  shut up  11 minutes  it's not  you're boring  everyone  all right  you're right  should I do  the you look  marvelous guy 
[01:47:00]  yes  you know how  fast I would  get a call  if I did that  in a rehearsal  from Colin  or Patricia  oh my god  or Keith  ah god  stupid  you don't  sound nothing  like a musician  yeah  you know how  fast I would  get smashed  by my friend  he needs  friends like  we have  can we finish  the clip  I'm just  milking  I want to hear  more  I want more  I wanted to  improv a little  can you dig that  I knew you could  and he's talking  about a hurricane  like retarded  children talk  about it  like it's not  it's not this  insightful 
[01:47:30]  jazz musician  guy  he's speaking  like a retard  describes a hurricane  and what happens  we heard about  this angry woman  Katrina coming  did ya  why didn't you  leave ya  dummy  you could feel  you could feel  the house  like standing  there fighting  its ground  and then the  rain come  rain come  hard  it's a hurricane  harder  it was like  it was like  being inside  a Buddy Rich  drum  when he was  beating on  him  but the  difference  between  God and  Buddy Rich  was  Buddy knew  when it was  time to quit 
[01:48:00]  it was shaking  so loud  you thought  that the house  was gonna  blow away  and then you  wake up  and the little  munchkin  cats would be  outside  God you dig  that  I knew  that you  could  they didn't  dig it  though  Bill  they didn't  dig it  they're not  digging anything  and he doesn't  know they can't  this is so  incredibly bad  I'm freaking  out  it's so bad  I refuse to  play  no you have  to  no I  refuse  I need  this pain  dude  by the way  the munchkin 
[01:48:30]  line was the  first thing  I saw  that was  like  okay  that's  definitely  a punch  line  he's  trying  he  you gotta  have  friends  that are  not afraid  of your  disapproval  beat him  up  someone  has to  a friend  of his  has to  beat him  up  a lot  of credit  to Peter  in Jersey  yes  Pryor's  Mudbone  comes to  mind  oh excuse  me  a guy  like Pryor  had done  something  like  Mudbone  was one  of Pryor's  most famous 
[01:49:00]  characters  here's an  example  of being  poignant  and funny  the wino  and the  junkie  bit  that Pryor  would do  was it  did a  wino  and the  junkie  yeah  very  actually  very  very  moving  characters  because  they  were  real  and  they  were  organic  but  they  were  hilarious  it's  like  Pryor said  he always  would  like  people  knew  a laugh  was  coming  so  they  would  actually  always  be  okay  to go  to a  very  sad  place  because  they  knew  they  were  going  to laugh  it  wasn't  just  11  minutes  of  just  ugh  right  all right  listen  why don't we  take a  right  no  no  no  no 
[01:49:30]  no  I don't  want  to  I need  to hear  the rest  of it  I have  to  I want  another  clip  I want  make me  I want  to subject  everybody  to this  Opie  can you  play that  I knew  that you  you know  what  no  no  I want  to hear  it  no  it's  so  bad  no  it's  okay  it is  attaboy  fan  you're  gonna be  okay  wait  after all  that drama  it's  okay  no

[01:50:30]  we should  make people  listen to  it  please  I gotta  I have  to  what reason  I don't  know why  you know  I found  the part  of me  that has  a little  bit of  masochism  in it  I'm not  into  SNL  I'm not  into being  tied up  or whipped  or anything  it's  audio  masochism  I'm into  oh you're  into something  though  we'll figure  it out  one of  these days  we're gonna  figure it out  it looks  like a belt  with a big  ruler with a  fireman's hat  on it  that's what  you're into  no

[01:59:00]  here  from the Boston  from the Boston Herald  this is a terrific story  they're going after  our violent video games  again  ladies and gentlemen  the T  should put the brakes  on violent video game ads  the T  they're  you know  the subway system  up there in Boston  yeah  they got ads for  Vice City  Grand Theft Auto  on the side of the T  right  what's the big deal  well the city is up in arms  in the video game  Vice City Stories  players can kill a prostitute  after having sex with her  yeah  nice  especially given the rise 
[01:59:30]  in sexual assaults  in the city  with 266 rapes  or attempted rapes  reported to Boston police  so far this year  no  is there a  is there a button  on this game  that you can press  and a big metal plate  falls on your car  as you drive through a tunnel  because  because maybe they should  pay attention to that  yeah  can you do that  Mr. Menino  well the video games  you know  they're the problem  they're the problem  Grand Theft Auto players  start the game  as lowly street thugs 
[02:00:00]  whose mission is to become  a crime kingpin  shooting cops  on their bloody rise  terrific  considering that  more than a dozen  Boston police officers  have been confronted  by armed suspects  in recent months  yeah  they're tying  how do you tie  these two things together  we better not sell  G.I. Joe dolls  because soldiers have died  we better not sell  a Barbie  in the convertible things  because Jane Mansfield  was beheaded  when her car  didn't do too well  Barbie heads  come off so easily  how great would that be  just roll her little 
[02:00:30]  Barbie mobile  pop the head off  by the way  we're proud to  to let everyone know  that we are part  of Vice City Stories  yeah  we're part of the problem  our buddy  Lazlo used all our voices  in the Grand Theft Auto  Vice City Stories game  yet advertisements  for these Rockstar  video games  are plastered across  MBTA trains  at a time  when 336 people  have been shot  in the city  many of them teenagers  and 67 people  have been murdered  do you think  if the game 
[02:01:00]  never existed  that there would be  one less shooting  in Boston  do you honestly believe  there would be  one less shooting  if that game  wasn't around  or advertised  no  or even made  and here's the line  that's going to just drive  especially Jimmy nuts  because we go over this  all the time  on this program  hey  I'm all for  First Amendment rights  but  but  yeah there it is  but  you can't be  for the First Amendment  and say but  at the same time  there's no but  after that 
[02:01:30]  there is no but  I was having  an email argument  with just this  scumbag  who was saying  that we're racist  about you know  freedom of speech  but your freedom of speech  is interfering with  but he just didn't like  the racial jokes  we do  too bad  sorry  but people always have  this asterisk  next to like  what you should be able  to say  it's like dude  as long as you're not  telling people  you know again  the old fire  in a movie theater  if you're not  causing people to riot  inciting a riot  it's legal to offend people  it's okay to offend people  it's completely legal  holy crap 
[02:02:00]  hey I'm  hey I'm all for  First Amendment rights  but does the city  really want teens  staring at advertisements  for video games  that promote  spilling innocent blood  the answer is  no  well don't answer  your own question  reporter  let me answer  yeah  yeah throw that question  out there  and then you're gonna  get right out of the mix  guess what  you throw that question  out there  you're gonna get  a few different  responses there  yeah  Michelle McPhee  let's see  some of these  same teens  are posting videos  of themselves  pulling out guns  and threatening  rival gang members  in city housing 
[02:02:30]  developments  on youtube.com  I don't think  I don't think  the game has  anything to do  with that  no  I think that's  called reality  that's a much  bigger problem  yeah that's  the problem  that's not gonna  get solved  by taking  advertisements  off the side  of buses  and trains  you dope  well city  councillor  Mike Ross  the do-gooder  along with  nearly two dozen  health care experts  youth advocates  street workers  ministers  child psychiatrists  and even teens  have penned a letter  to MBTA  general manager 
[02:03:00]  blah blah blah  urging him  to pull the ads  the letter  will be delivered  to  Grabowskis  this morning  ew  that'll stop  all the crime  good  well Boston  safest city  I guess  because  there won't  be any more  shootings  that's right  because they're  dealing with it  by taking away  advertising  for a game  at a time  of escalating  concerns about  youth violence  in the Boston  area  it is  unconscionable  sorry  that the MBTA  would feature  advertising  for a violent  video game  the letter  reads  it is both 
[02:03:30]  cynical  and irresponsible  for the MBTA  to advertise  violent video games  as you are  surely aware  shootings are up  21%  and homicides  are up to  12%  over last year  is already  high level  maybe you got  bigger problems  to deal with  then  this has  nothing to do  with the violence  in your city  how about this  no more  alcohol advertisements  on buses  or at games  because  guys are drinking  it and beating  their wives  into the hospital  or people are  drinking it  and then crashing  into limos 
[02:04:00]  on Long Island  and little girls  heads are coming  how about that  killing people  instead of some  intangible threat  like  the video  is violent  that causes  no it doesn't  no  it would not  be one less  shooting  or crime  or anything  if there was  no  Grand Theft Auto  game  well here's  where the bit  turns to  to be a little  bit funny  this is also  the Boston Herald  today  hookers split  on impact of ads  they went out  and interviewed  the hookers  because you know  they're in the 
[02:04:30]  game obviously  who's this  go-getter journalist  no kidding  Orion Johnson  took this  oh Orion Johnson  yeah  took this angle  let me talk  to the whores  he got arrested  oh no  he's interviewing her  there's some  good quotes here  Boston's hookers  are divided over  whether the  MBTA should be  running ads  on trains  for a video game  which players  kill and rob  ladies of the night  I think is horrible  said Sage  a Boston area  prostitute  contacted through  her Craiglist.org  ad  this guy is 
[02:05:00]  covering his ass  because his wife  freaking did a  little searching  on the old  computer  I bet his mom  has cried to him  on the phone  a couple of times  this guy contacted  her Craiglist.org  ad  god I bet you  this guy had to  invent an entire  story that now  all of Boston  has to read  because his wife  caught him  no honey  I was doing  research  the old  Pete Townsend  excuse  about teens  seeing the  Grand Theft Auto  Vice City  stories ads 
[02:05:30]  it's ridiculous  out here  nowadays  just the violence  among teenagers  however south  of Boston  another hooker  Nikki said  she likes  nothing more  than spending  time away  from her  Johns  playing the  same video  game  slicing  shooting  and robbing  her way  up to  the criminal  food chain  you can actually  pick them up  have sex  with them  and steal  their money  she said  it doesn't  bother me  asked if she's  ever killed  a prostitute  online  she said  yes I have  I kill  everybody on  the game  I don't mind  it's kind  of fun  my friend  said there's  even a way  to play  as a pimp  that's what 
[02:06:00]  the game's  about  shut up  and these  pompous  asses think  they're getting  something done  by doing  stories on this  in the paper  they're just  turning more  people on  to Grand Theft Auto  Vice City stories  pick it up  stores near you  Billy Crystal song  gotta hear it  gotta hear it  fan worked hard  and brought it in  got to hear it  did you bring it  I knew that you would  I knew that you would  I knew that you would  I knew that you would  Isaac in Jersey  real fast  Isaac  yeah  I actually read 
[02:06:30]  an article recently  in Slate Magazine  that they said  violent video games  reduce crime  you read  in Blade Magazine  that violent video games  actually reduce violence  I would like to see that  I don't buy it  one way or another  yeah I don't either  I think they just  are there  and that's what  they're just there  to play  they don't impact  real life  sorry  there you go  alright here's the  Billy Crystal song  oh hold on  hold on  just think  what it's like for us 
[02:07:00]  do you understand that  Mr. Bush  do you  do you know  what it means  to miss  New Orleans  and miss it  each night  and day  I know  I'm not wrong  the feeling's  getting stronger  the longer  I stay  away  oh god  Mr. Moss  colored vines  the tall

[02:32:30]  Thank you. 
[02:33:00]  Thank you. 
[02:33:30]  That was you, Bill, that went to the music. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Right after he said thanks to the crowd.  And then we come down the hallway.  Bill, do you ever listen to the show?  Have you heard the walkover?  When we say goodbye to the crowd, we say thanks for showing up, and then we have a little chit-chat between the three of us as we walk toward the big pile of shit at the desk with the tie thrown into it.  Yeah.  As Jimmy always says, and we have our little chit-chat, and then the cue is pretty much, all right, well, we'll see you upstairs. 
[02:34:30]  It was Bill, right?  And I had to know Bill was going to be sitting back there.  Bill, we finally found something you don't do well.  You're trying.  You know, it's cute and all.  And you do everything else perfectly, doesn't he?  Bill's looking everywhere but in here.  No, he cannot look in here now.  People at home can't see he's looking down, he's looking at the monitor, he's going about his business, and he's detached. 
[02:35:00]  It's a different Bill.  It's as if I'm chastising him as the Billy Crystal Jazz character.  He can't look at me.  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  Oh, shit.  They gave that to you?  Oh, yeah, I got a weapon in my arsenal.  Oh, man, that stinks.  I knew that you could.  That is horrid.  I knew that you could.  Shut up.  We got to talk about Michael Richards, too.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Fucking what a good boy he is.  And Rosen's, right?  Rosen's, 51st in Madison.  Here in New York City, they're supplying the breakfast. 
[02:35:30]  Don't let the savages have any food until we have a little something.  All right.  Yeah, tell them to keep that dirty fucking hand coughing and two fingers out of it.  Oh, the second they touch something, it's over.  Let's say hi to Lady Di.  Lady Di, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Better now that you called, dear.  Why are you calling us every day?  Why?  I need to know why.  I don't call you every day.  Every day.  Every day.  But we don't throw you on the radio.  But you're calling every day.  Why?  Why are you calling us? 
[02:36:00]  Because I love you.  Look, look, look.  Let me tell you something right now.  I love you guys.  And so does Marion.  Both of us love you guys.  Thanks.  Well, I don't love you.  You're not even a thought.  You don't have to love me.  You're not even a thought in my head when I'm not doing this radio show.  Oh, my God.  I tried to get through to you on 3FM, everything like that.  You're trying to get through every day.  Why?  What do you have for this program?  No, I'm not trying to get through every day.  We're moving on with new characters.  We don't need you anymore. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  We used you.  We got good radio out of you, and that's it.  Yeah, what do you want to say, Di?  You got the floor.  You used us, and you got the radio out of us.  What do you want to say?  What do you want to say?  Go.  I want to say hello to you guys.  Well, we're doing a radio show.  I know you're doing a radio show.  Guess what, Lady Di?  I'm sure my mom would love to say hi to me today.  Guess what?  She's not, because she knows we're doing a radio show.  My mom would love to say hi, too, but she can't, because I'm a queer who's in jail.  No, you're not. 
[02:37:00]  No, you're not.  I heard about the show on Friday and everything.  Oh, you heard about what?  But you know what?  You know what?  I'm glad you're not.  I'm glad everything is okay.  And your show in Vegas was good, I heard.  Oh, my God.  Lady Di, this is the type of conversation you have with a friend on your own time.  It's not radio show material.  This isn't a phone call you do in front of a million-plus people.  Well, maybe she has somewhere she's going with this.  I don't know.  Let's play it out.  It was a good show.  Thanks a lot.  Hey, listen, listen.  I know somebody that has a PlayStation 3 right now. 
[02:37:30]  Cool.  I don't want a PlayStation 3.  Oh, yeah?  How did they get it?  I know someone that has...  No, he stood in line at a Target store.  How did they get it?  No.  I believe it was Friday night, Thursday night, Friday night.  Well, Thursday or Friday.  What was it?  It's important.  I think it was Thursday night.  Why do we care that it has a PlayStation 3?  I want to see where this would go.  Yeah, play it out.  I want to play out her conversation.  I want to see where this would go.  All right.  All right.  Well, didn't you say something about you want somebody to bring it over to the studio, Opie? 
[02:38:00]  While there was a line.  Yes, Lady Di.  Three days ago.  Yeah.  While there was a line.  Three days ago.  You might as well just give me a Sega at this point.  And there were people online waiting.  Yeah, Di.  There were people on that now.  Do you understand timing?  Do you understand what timing is all about?  Her husband did.  Just looked at her schedule.  Her husband?  Yeah.  He came up with an idea.  Whatever he was.  Whatever he was.  I was going to smash a PS3 as people were waiting in line to get their PS3.  He wasn't a good husband.  He had to be trained.  All right.  All right.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  No, no, no.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right about that.  You're right about that.  All right.  So, did you do that?  Did you get one?  No.  No, we didn't.  Okay.  I know somebody that has one.  We don't need one.  We don't need one now.  Which I said already.  Yeah, which he said already.  Because of the timing thing that you just agreed with.  And then went back into the same thing and had to have us answer the same thing again.  Oh, wait.  She has a question.  What's your question?  What's going on with the homeless shopping spree?  Oh, you want to join?  We're doing it. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  December 16th, I believe.  Why?  Do you want to look at the ones and see how many you may have blown under a train trestle?  How ironic is that?  That's very ironic.  No.  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  She's drunk.  I just wanted to find out.  So, Lady Di, Di, you're drunk.  Do you swallow or spit the hobo cum?  Everyone wants to know.  Hobo cum.  Let's get into some real questions here.  Yeah.  Do you swallow or spit, or maybe just as a goof to make everyone laugh, you gargle it a little  bit?  Nothing.  What is it?  Nothing.  I don't do anything with...  Do you swallow it or spit it out? 
[02:39:30]  What do you do with the hobo cum?  I don't do anything like that.  I have a boyfriend.  You know, when you're blowing hobos so you can have a drink, what is it?  I don't blow hobos.  Do you get more money if you swallow the hobo cum or what?  Oh, my God.  Or they don't really care at that point?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, nothing like that.  You're drunk, Di.  You hear her say, Lady Di, why are you drunk at this hour?  I am not drunk.  You've been drinking.  Stop lying.  You're a liar.  Why?  What did you have so far?  I had a couple of natural lices. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm not going to lie to you.  You had some beers already.  I'm drinking beers.  And now, I thought you had a job.  No, I'm not working today.  Oh, God.  And the awful cough from swallowing hobo cum.  No, I'm sorry about that.  What happened to your job?  Did you lose your job?  No.  No.  It's a temp agency I work for.  So sometimes you don't work on Mondays for a temp agency.  What were you doing?  What kind of temp work?  Lady Di.  Warehouse.  Lady Di.  What they usually do.  All right.  She was being one. 
[02:40:30]  They were renting her shirt and storing things under her.  No, no.  I am not a warehouse.  I am not a warehouse.  Lady Di.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  I want to give a look into Lady Di's future.  All right.  If this fucking hobo whore would shut the fuck up for a second, we'll do this.  Excuse me.  I'm not a hobo whore.  But anyway, go ahead.  Than, run into the studio and make believe that we just found out that Lady Di finally  died of alcoholism.  No.  That'll never happen.  Just run in.  And make believe we're just doing a regular show. 
[02:41:00]  Like, wow, man, that walkover was just terrific, Anthony, you know?  Starting the second half.  Fantastic.  The XM cell.  Still screwed up a little.  Oh, God.  Oh, Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  What's up, Dan?  I just heard that Lady Di died of alcoholism.  Oh, wow.  That sucks.  Anyway, we got this restaurant here.  Yeah.  We're going to be making omelets for the whole crew today.  Great food.  It's our launch of the virus.  Right.  That's about all the time you're going to get when we find out you die. 
[02:41:30]  No.  I am never going to die.  Oh, you're never going to be the one.  You're going to be the one.  No.  No, I'm not.  No way.  Why don't you get married on the phone?  For what reason, Lady Di?  Will you stop calling our show?  You are the worst caller ever.  Ever.  Ever.  And person.  I'm the first caller ever on your XM show?  Yeah.  The day I was.  Yeah.  No, worst.  Not first, you idiot.  I said worst. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, you drunk.  Oh, okay.  I'll.  You know what you are, Di?  You're a sot.  A sot.  You're a drunken sot.  Hey, Di, you don't understand the problem.  The problem in drinking at this hour of the morning.  You don't see a problem there.  Uh, I'm eating.  No.  I'm drinking.  You don't see.  Answer.  Answer my fucking question.  You don't see a problem that you're drinking this early in the morning. 
[02:42:30]  Yes, I do.  All right.  So why are you, why are you doing it?  Uh, because I don't know.  I just figured I'd get up and have a beer.  I don't know.  Do you understand most people don't think like that?  Uh, why do you think you think like that?  Why don't you say it, say it, say it, why do you say it, why do you do it?  I'm an alcoholic.  Very good.  That's terrific, John.  I had to tell you.  That's terrific. 
[02:43:00]  Right?  There's one.  So you're not really working on it, though, huh?  By the way, the only time I would make fun of that.  No.  No, I was working on it.  Well, as long as you were.  I was working on it.  Yeah.  And I still am, and I'm still working on it.  Yeah.  What are you doing about it, Lady Di?  What are you doing about it?  Uh, well, not really much.  Mulling it over with a couple of beers?  Yeah, no, I want to know what are you doing about it.  I hope I asked a very good question. 
[02:43:30]  What are you doing about it?  Uh, nothing much, really.  But then why did you say you were doing something about it?  I don't know.  What can I do about it?  Yeah, what can you?  Yeah, what can you?  No one's ever done anything about it.  You got a son that you don't take care of, and you can't get steady work, but you can  drink, and you love hobo cum.  As a mother, you're a flop.  My son is very well taken care of.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, not by you. 
[02:44:00]  You're a flop.  Where do you let the hobo shooters cum?  Yeah.  On the face?  What hobo?  Because you get a little more money for it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  What do you do with the hobo cum?  Never mind about my problems.  Hold on one second.  What are you talking about, hobo?  Hey, Di, can I ask a question?  I mean this.  What do you think your son is doing when he goes to his friend's house, and they have  dinner with the kid's mom, and he goes, where's your mom?  And he wants to go, oh, she's blowing a guy in a refrigerator box behind some weeds, 
[02:44:30]  but he can't say that.  No, no.  My son is not like that.  To get a Meister Brow.  Meister Brow.  The master brew.  That's right.  It's the master brew.  So what do you think, he says?  She's got the hobo brew in her throat.  No, no, no.  My son is not like that.  Master goo.  No, your son's not like that, but you are.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  You're a drunken embarrassment, and do you realize that your son has to make up excuses  about where you are and what you're doing, because the truth of the way you're behaving  is embarrassing and humiliating to them. 
[02:45:00]  You're a flop as a parent.  No, listen.  You're a flop.  No, I'm not a flop.  What a couple.  Shut your face.  What a couple of selfish cunts this poor kid got for parents.  Oh, I know.  One fucking, one has a train for lunch, and one has a beer.  My son has unconditional love for me.  Oh, that's horrific.  Your son, you have no idea, hates and resents you.  Hey, Jimmy, did you ever meet my son?  I don't think he did. 
[02:45:30]  No, I don't need, I've met enough people with drunk parents who hate them and resent them  and are embarrassed by them.  You're a flop as a parent.  You're an abandoner, and your son, deep down, hates your guts.  Beer is more important than your kid.  He hates your guts.  Hey, Lady Di, when you're, like, swallowing the hobo cum and it's leaving a bad taste in  your mouth, uh, what's, what's the chaser?  Like, Blackberry Brandy?  What's, what's the chaser?  Opie.  What's the chaser?  I don't do that.  I don't do that. 
[02:46:00]  We have you on tape in a minute and you blow guys on the train track.  No, I did not.  We don't have tape of you in a minute and then you blow guys on the train track.  Play it again.  Play it again.  No, we ain't playing it again.  Play it again, Sam.  Play it.  So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I wouldn't do that.  What are you doing for Thanksgiving besides not seeing your son?  I'm going to go over to see my dad and my son.  That's good.  Just draw, why don't you just roll in off a drunken bender smelling, you stunk, your face  was dirty.  You're the one that shows up at the, at the family Thanksgiving, uh, table and everyone 
[02:46:30]  has to look down and go, oh God, we were hoping one day out of the year she would  like get it together.  She drops the turkey on the floor, makes a big scene, starts crying.  Trying to be charming.  Walks in the door.  Cause this is a happened.  Oh, nevermind.  Burn nuts.  Come on.  Hi, everyone.  Oh, how are you doing?  Oh boy, look who's here.  Where do you want to sit?  Oh, the drunk is here.  And everyone's sitting there all thinking the same thing.  God, one day we were hoping one day she could get it together for her son who was hoping 
[02:47:00]  to, you know, uh, hoping to see her all sober today.  But instead you get, so that is not true.  I will be completely sober when I see my son.  Your son has disgusting, selfish parents.  You're poor.  I have great parents.  Your son had disgusting, self-centered, shit-faced parents.  And lady Di, when you're at your dad's house for Thanksgiving, are you going to like, uh,  I don't know, maybe sneak into the bathroom to take a little shot? 
[02:47:30]  A little nip out of a glass.  Cause you're going to try not to drink in front of him?  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't take anything to the bathroom.  You're just, I've got to go.  Give mommy a kiss.  And all he remembers when he gets older, all he's going to remember is your booze breath.  Yeah.  And your, your, uh, uh, uh, red, uh, uh, cheeks from drinking too much.  You know what you look like?  You look like someone who's playing a bum in a play.  Shut up, you interrupter.  You are a bad parent.  And worse than that, you're an interrupter of jokes.  Even worse than being the ex-girlfriend of a train eater. 
[02:48:00]  You are an interrupter of jokes.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Choo, choo.  You're an interrupter of jokes.  What I was going to say is you look like someone who's actually being a bum in a play.  Like, she looks like if you walk backstage at a play, that's what you look like.  And there's some charcoal to rub on her face.  You look like Chico Marx as a bum.  Someone is suggesting that, uh, someone is suggesting that Lady Di is going to have a much different Thanksgiving. 
[02:48:30]  She's going to blow a hobo after he eats a turkey sandwich.  Oh.  Oh, no.  There you go.  Wow, I don't know if this is mayo or hobo cum.  Sometimes I can't tell the difference.  All the trimmings.  That is so shit.  You know what your nickname is in your family?  The Black Cloud.  Here she comes to ruin everyone's Thanksgiving.  Great.  You have fucking hair like the bassist in a punk band.  You're a stringy embarrassment. 
[02:49:00]  And your kid has to make up excuses as to why the fucking, the drunken monster whose pussy he fucking had the poor, unfortunate luck to pop out of isn't around ever.  Shut up!  Because you're fucking bumbling around from shitty temp job to shitty temp job.  And everybody has reached out and tried to help you and get you into a rehab.  And you're a self-centered fuck.  And you don't care about your own kid.  And your fucking ex-boyfriend didn't give a shit about the kid.  So he fucking bit the fucking front end of a train to get away from you. 
[02:49:30]  That's how awful you are.  That guy abandoned his own kid to get away from you.  You self-centered, drunken son.  Shut your face.  Your kid hates your guts.  He doesn't love you.  He doesn't think it's charming that mom walks in.  You're not a charming drunk.  You're a dirty-faced, horrible-toothed, bad-breath fucking sot.  And he hates your guts deep down.  He resents you.  What's your son's name there, Lady Di?  We forget.  Peter.  Peter.  Peter hates you.  Hey, oh, Peter.  Hi.  Give mommy a kiss. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, hi.  How was school this week?  We were off.  Peter.  Peter.  Come get my head.  You'd know that if...  I keep in touch with him all the time.  Yeah, I bet you do.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  What, do you put a message in the fucking bottle you just finished off?  Yeah.  Throw it into the ocean.  This fucking police song.  He's a Yankee fan and a Giants fan.  Really?  Too bad he's not a fucking mom fan.  He's trying to watch anything to distract him from the fact that his mother is a self-centered 
[02:50:30]  drunk who has turned down all help, and every chance to be a real mother you have turned  down, and believe me, your kid fucking hates you deep down.  How does that feel?  Flop.  Yes, he does.  No, he does not.  Yes, he does.  Yeah.  He's disgusted by you.  You're an embarrassment.  That is not true.  Fucking embarrassment.  I feel bad for him.  By Giant Fan, are you trying to say he's a fan of yours?  I feel bad, too, but, you know, no.  Yeah, but not bad enough to quit fucking shoving beer into your fat face at 7 o'clock 
[02:51:00]  in the morning.  You know what?  Not even, I mean, I would even go this little, man.  At least, at least try.  You don't even try.  You can hear it.  There are people all over the place, probably listening to the show, they got some deep  issues, but they're at least trying.  You don't even try.  I don't even try.  You're a fucking sickening disgrace, and your son resents you deep down.  You have fucked that kid up.  He has no parents.  What do you mean, don't try?  We actually got somebody, one of our great fans, to drive you to a rehab facility, and 
[02:51:30]  you ran away at the front door.  I didn't run away.  I didn't run away.  They would not take you.  I didn't run away.  She waddled.  You hear the one, one away?  Yeah, I didn't run away.  I didn't run away.  I would have run away.  I didn't run away.  They wouldn't take blah, blah, excuse, excuse.  Lady die.  Lady die.  Lady die.  Just do us one favor.  When you go into that alcoholic coma, just before you do, please dial this number so  we can record your death live on our show.  I will. 
[02:52:00]  No.  I will.  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  No.  No.  And then we'll invite all the hobos to come over your house and make a bukkake video with  their hobo cum.  That's what you deserve.  No.  There's no.  What do you mean hobo cum?  What are you talking about?  Did you or did you not blow hobos?  No, I did not.  Liar.  You're a liar.  This is why we can't deal with you on any level.  I'm a liar.  Marion.  A liar.  Hello.  How are you?  What's up, Marion?  Oh, there's Marion.  Hi, Marion.  Do me a favor. 
[02:52:30]  Hi, Marion.  Hi, Marion.  Hi, Jim.  Do me a favor.  If you're going to pick on Diane, pick on Diane, but don't pick on Peter because that's  my job.  Shut up.  No one's picking on Peter.  He's embarrassed by her.  Don't jump in, you knee-jerk reactionary fucking muppet mouth.  Shut up.  Fuck Peter.  Fuck Peter.  Yeah, fuck Peter and his young butt.  Quiet, you fucking muppet-headed zilch.  We're not making fun of Peter.  We're making fun of this embarrassing sot as a mother.  Jimmy, I know what you're trying to tell Diane, but leave the kid out of it.  Shut up.  I'll talk about the kid and I'll throw you a fish, Pelican Nick. 
[02:53:00]  Shut up.  Don't tell me what to talk about.  I like your show, by the way.  Thank you.  That you did two weeks ago, even though I told you afterwards.  I appreciate it, blue whale tongue.  Don't call me a whale, because I lost a lot of weight, honey.  You did.  Don't call me a whale.  You did.  Thank you.  Yeah, I did.  You did.  That was spelled 480.  Yeah, Chris.  Yeah, 480.  Try 148.  What?  Try 148 pounds.  On what planet?  Exactly.  Yeah, on Jupiter, you're 148.  No, I am.  See, that's a beauty of you, Jim. 
[02:53:30]  I couldn't figure out what planet to pick.  I couldn't either.  I think I went the wrong way.  Yeah, you did.  Oh, okay.  Oh, of course Anthony would know.  Yeah, wait a minute.  One of the smaller planets without an atmosphere would have been better.  All right.  Something like maybe Mercury.  Hey, Anthony, where were you that night at Jimmy's show?  He has a life.  He didn't go.  I was probably busy.  I don't remember really.  Probably lost in his mansion?  Yeah.  I was trying to find the front door.  Where were you there?  You still drank. 
[02:54:00]  Both of you guys still drank.  We all still drank.  A lot less than I used to.  And let me tell you, not during work, Marion.  Well, there's a lie.  Unfortunately for the listeners.  But listen, if you're going to pick on Diane, pick on Diane.  Don't pick on her kid.  Dude, first of all, we're not picking on her stupid kid.  Now that you're saying that, I'm going to pick on the kid.  Don't talk about her son because her son's my godchild and he shouldn't have to, you know.  Oh, that makes things a lot better.  Here's something.  Here's something, Marion.  Very close and sacred relationship.  I hope Peter has to blow a hobo to find out where his mom is. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, he sees his mother every week.  That never happens.  He sees his mother every week.  Look, son, I'll tell you where your mom is, but you're going to have to take care of me first.  And if Diane is drinking...  Don't tell us what to do because then we'll do exactly that.  That's right.  Peter, Peter, load eater.  Oh.  But listen to me.  Jimmy, you were in that situation too at one time, so you know what it's like.  I know that.  But I'm saying she's a self-centered slob.  She's a flop as a parent. 
[02:55:00]  And die.  People make mistakes, but let me say something.  Her kid hates her guts, and that's the reality of it.  My kid doesn't hate my guts.  I have empathy for you being an alcoholic, but you're a self-centered slob.  And your kid hates you deep down.  Are you not self-centered?  He doesn't hate her.  Yes, he does.  Lady...  No, he does not.  I should know.  I'm a kid.  You don't know.  You don't know.  He hates her.  I do love my kid every week.  Deep down, she's an embarrassment, and he hates her for it.  No, no, she's not.  She's an abandoning slob and an embarrassment. 
[02:55:30]  Marian, Lady Di is drunk at nine in the morning.  I don't know if she's three more.  It's a Monday morning.  Look, Marian, we know you love her, and you have to defend her, and it's uncomfortable  to realize that your godson...  I want to defend my godchild.  Your godchild...  What's his name again?  Yeah, it's Peter, and he's 15 years old.  I'm sure he's a good boy.  Your son...  Your god...  Shut your mouth!  Oh, my God, they don't shut up.  Marian, stop talking.  Your godson has a flop for a mother. 
[02:56:00]  His mother is a...  Diane isn't as bad as she would.  Okay, you talk.  You would know.  All right.  Guys, Diane isn't as bad as she used to be.  She's a fucking awful...  Josh from Jersey.  Peter deep-throats, bums-on, take your child to work day.  He's a little hobo, stop it.  The guy that she's with...  The guy that she's with...  Oh, God.  For the past few months.  Peter, here's where mommy works.  I'm not going to say her voice was the same, because that's none of your business.  And your business, and your business.  You see that shit-stained mattress? 
[02:56:30]  That's where mommy lays down to blow hobos.  Can we get rid of these two?  I can't do it to them anymore.  I was amused for a while.  I was curious as to where this monster would go with a conversation.  What monster?  I just...  I can't deal with them today.  Can we at least talk about Michael Richards?  Yeah.  Please.  Marion.  What?  You got to give up on Lady Di.  No, I'm not.  Why should I?  We all have one of these people in our lives, and you know what?  You know what?  You got to just give up after a while.  I talk to Diane every day. 
[02:57:00]  And the times I do talk to Diane, she's not drinking.  I live a few blocks away from her.  If I find out that she's drinking, I can walk to her house and make the shit out of her.  She is drinking.  She admitted it.  She admitted it.  She's drunk now, you dope.  When I was talking to her a half hour ago, she didn't sound like she was drinking.  Diana.  Diana.  Why not even...  Shut up!  You're lying in here.  Shut your mouth.  Shut up.  Diana.  What'd you drink this morning?  What'd I drink this morning?  Yes.  Diane.  Shut up, Marion.  You hear that, Marion? 
[02:57:30]  Why are you drinking this time of the morning?  I know.  I know.  You ain't supposed to be drinking.  Just because it's a three-day week doesn't mean drink.  I know that.  Why didn't you tell me you were drinking?  I told you don't call a show if you're drinking.  You don't listen to me.  All right.  You never listen to me.  Everybody back on me now.  Because, Diane, I told you, don't drink, okay?  Just because you're off for work doesn't mean you have to have a beer.  You might have to go to work tomorrow. 
[02:58:00]  Well, I know that.  I'm off for work for a certain reason.  Why I'm off is because I have to go somewhere.  That's why.  No, I know I might have to go to work tomorrow.  I have to call my phone.  But, Bill, why are you drinking this time of the morning?  You know, if What's-His-Face comes home for work and finds you drinking,  he's going to start screaming at you.  I know.  And, you know, I'm not going to say his name because I'm only going to say What's-His-Face.  What, are you playing a solid game right now?  Yes, exactly.  Because they'll listen to our conversation. 
[02:58:30]  That's exactly what they're doing.  And they're looking.  I remember that.  They want to see if I mentioned What's-His-Face's name.  And I'm not going to mention What's-His-Face's name.  Because What's-His-Face is too nice to you.  Hey, Marion, are you working on what you're going to say at Lady Di's Wake?  No, because you know what?  Diane doesn't drink as much as she used to, okay?  You know who you are?  You're an enabler.  I was going to say it.  You're an enabler, Marion.  You're a codependent slob and an enabler.  Your friend is drunk on a Monday morning. 
[02:59:00]  It's not her fault.  And you're going to sit there and say she doesn't drink as much?  Ew, ew, it's not her fault.  It's not her fault.  It's not her fault.  Shut your fat face.  Why isn't it not her fault?  It's not her fault what I do.  I'm not talking to you.  Marion, why isn't it her fault?  I don't know why she's drinking this time of the morning.  She really is.  I'm going to go over to her house.  When I'm going to get done doing what I've got to do this afternoon, I'm going to knock  her out.  She just admitted she was drinking.  You're going to knock her out.  I know why.  Because you went and looked. 
[02:59:30]  Never mind.  You don't want me to say it.  How are you going to knock her out?  Take that saggy boob of yours and swing her like that?  I'm going to knock on the door and hand it to your next to her neighbor.  Marion, why don't you take off your Sammy Hagar wig and fucking smash her with that?  I don't have a Sammy Hagar wig.  Shut up if you do that fucking awful blonde claymation thing on your head.  It's horrifying.  Shut up so we can enjoy Norton's line with Dr. Seuss' character.  Blonde Frank Gifford helmet.  Your hair is shaped like an Egyptian pharaoh. 
[03:00:00]  King cunt.  How do you like them apples?  No, it ain't.  Oh, really?  That's all you got?  Guys.  No, it's a couple more than that.  A good one, Jerry.  Just more than that.  Come on.  You got to have a lot more than that.  You're both shitheads and jerks.  And for Opie to go around saying Jim Norton got arrested on Friday, that was wrong.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up, ladle hair.  That's fucking wrong.  I mean, come on.  Why don't you help your friend out and stop being such a slump? 
[03:00:30]  She's not an alcoholic.  Yes, she is, big tongue.  She's an alcoholic.  Yeah, I admit it.  If you think you can help her, why don't you come to Elizabeth's and help her?  I don't care about her.  Marion asked the worst questions, too.  She's the worst.  Why are you drinking?  Because the night of your show, you asked me how Lady Di was doing.  Exactly.  And you ignorantly told me she was doing well, you fucking misinformed boss.  You know what?  Because Jimmy has a soft spot in his heart for people that have substance abuse problems.  Yeah, who are trying to help themselves.  The ones that try to help themselves. 
[03:01:00]  Right.  Like Nathaniel.  The poor kid can't kick cock, but he's trying.  I used to have one myself, too, 20 years ago.  Yeah.  What were you addicted to?  Shitty hair products?  No.  I couldn't get enough home perm systems.  My hair is short now.  She's addicted to a hair straightener.  Marion the frowner.  My hair is short now.  This is getting fun again.  Like it was fun, then it sucked.  It's getting fun again, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, guys.  Well, anytime you can make fun of Marion. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  My hair is short now.  Is it really?  My hair is short.  Well, that's so the hair doesn't get in the way of the hobo cock.  Yeah, exactly.  He was probably torn out by some bum as he tried to run away.  I'm still trying to understand what you're talking about exactly.  I know you are.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, Diana don't hang out with the hobos no more.  I don't hang out with the hobos.  What are you talking about?  You never hung out with the homeless?  Are you insane?  You pathological liar.  You know what you are, Di?  Wait, wait, wait.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Yes, I was doubting out at one time. 
[03:02:00]  Okay, fine.  All right?  But I don't hang out with people that are, you know, living in the element.  I don't know what that is.  Living in the element?  Aren't we all technically dead?  I don't hang out with people who are, you know, indoors, outdoors, breathing air.  Come on, guys.  Hold the phone a minute.  O.B. Anthony, I got a place where you guys can have your home with shopping spree.  Yeah, where?  On your tongue?  No, at a Jersey corner door right here.  On the tracks where Lady Di blows hobos. 
[03:02:30]  Yo!  What?  The Jersey Gardens Mall.  What?  The Jersey Gardens Mall right here with Elizabeth.  What?  I can't hear a word you're saying.  They're both just babbling over each other.  What?  You heard me.  I didn't hear you.  What?  The Jersey Gardens Mall.  You know, I hope you two fucking drive off a cliff like Thelma and Louise, and you don't  even realize you're dying because you're both just babbling at each other.  How come there's dirt headed towards us?  I don't know.  I'm a good parent.  How come there's dirt headed towards the window?  I don't know.  My son loves me.  No, no, no. 
[03:03:00]  No, no, no, no.  We're not crashing.  We're not at the malls in New Jersey, do you?  What?  You know anything about the malls in New Jersey?  Uh, they probably have a Starbucks.  They do?  And a Gap.  And a...  And a...  What?  What?  Have you ever been to the malls in New Jersey?  Besides Palamas?  They're the worst conversation keeper goers.  Like, they just ask the most inane questions to try to keep a moment going. 
[03:03:30]  No, Hawaiian's your shirt.  Wow, thanks for that fodder.  Let me get on a roll.  See?  They don't even listen to each other.  They don't.  You know what you are?  They're like penguins talking to each other.  That's exactly what you are.  You're penguins.  How long is that?  You're going to go to my house for dinner.  Two fucking fat hens.  Seagulls at the beach.  Yeah.  Where they're just arguing over a french fry. 
[03:04:00]  Hey, Diana.  I'm over here.  Guys.  Hey, Diana, if they have the homeless shopping street by our house, I can invite them over  to my house for dinner.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  It should be Tom, Andrew, O.B., Anthony, Jim.  Oh, the whole crew.  Oh, they can come to my house.  Oh, it sounds fantastic.  I have a nice big house.  I'm sure you do.  You have to to fit that tongue somewhere.  And you have a whole...  She has a wig room.  I don't have a wig room.  A fucking wig room.  This is what I want to look like.  A 17th century judge, I put this one on.  Shut your George Washington face. 
[03:04:30]  Shut up, fucking Supreme Court justice.  I know you're still looking for a place to live, so I don't want to say nothing bad about  that.  What?  I don't give a shit.  I'm pretty much homeless.  Everyone knows it.  But why can't you find an apartment?  What's the matter?  You're looking for a special apartment.  See, they just throw out questions.  They keep it going.  I'll explain.  I'll explain.  Because I'm not sure if I want to spend $3 million or $4 million on a place.  I'm still up in the air.  Oh, you want to live in a mansion? 
[03:05:00]  Oh, fuck yourself.  We have $4 million?  No, that's what it sounds like.  You want to go live in a mansion, which is interesting.  No, I don't want to live in a mansion, actually.  You don't know shit about me.  Yeah.  Yes, I do.  I just want to...  I just know lately you've been having a bad attitude once, see ya?  You know a lot about me.  Lately?  Lately, because I can't stand you.  Lately, you've been nine years?  Hey, you miss us on the show.  Your ratings are going down.  You don't have that many people on the show anymore, because you don't want it in the morning.  Really?  I'm looking at about 100 people watching our show live right now. 
[03:05:30]  You ass.  Holy mackerel.  I like girls.  Nice.  And I've heard a message for the lighting up and everything, honey.  Believe me.  Ooh.  What?  Me and Diane, we did the show, and a lot of people said that we were part of the show.  We were the best things that came on.  Well, and then your partner proceeded to drink herself to death and suck on hobo cock and swallow hobo cum  to the point where she doesn't even know what reality is anymore.  Hey, Marion.  I was saying there were one person that was...  Marion, you're a part of the show the same way a tumor is part of a colon. 
[03:06:00]  Like, it's there, but it needs to be cut out because it's wrecking everything.  That's what you are.  You're a tumor with fucking Supreme Court Justice wig hair.  Marion, here's a taste of reality.  You used to do some fine bits with Lady Di.  Absolutely.  We did.  But then Lady Di's drinking got completely out of hand where she lost her kids, she lost  her job, she lost a sense of reality, where she ended up living on the tracks, sucking  on hobo cock and swallowing hobo cum.  And that's the only thing that is now interesting about Lady Di, and that's why she continues  to be on the show. 
[03:06:30]  But as far as doing bits for this fine show called The Opie and Anthony Show, it's long  over.  Yeah.  Truthfully, I still miss going up there, but I can't because I work every day.  No one cares.  Well, why?  No one asks for you.  I welcome me and my husband up there, Columbus Day.  Hold on a minute, hold on a minute.  We feel bad for your husband.  Let's go to Linda in Monroe.  Linda.  I just wanted to make a comment.  I've listened to you forever, but I have never heard such deep-seated, utter hatred that 
[03:07:00]  like Opie has for those two.  I agree with it completely, but you could just say...  It's not even...  You hate them.  I hate to admit it.  Well, I kind of talked about things in the past, but this hits way too close to home,  and I'm so sick of people that are in your lives that ruin your fucking life.  And all you're doing is trying to support them, trying to support them, and then you  realize they can't support themselves.  So yeah, this hits real close to home.  I don't hate Marion, to be honest with you.  I don't mind her at all.  I wouldn't mind giving Marion... 
[03:07:30]  I could take her or leave her, to be honest.  It's Lady Di that I despise.  I wouldn't mind, to be honest, and I don't mean any disrespect by this, but Marion, I  wouldn't mind straddling your shoulders and giving your mouth a good fuck.  All right, thank you.  A little observation from Linda.  Let's go back to the dimwits.  All I want to do now is tell Marion how I want to fuck her in the mouth.  Hey, Marion...  Marion.  I want to fuck her in the hotel.  Marion.  What's that?  I have a husband who I have sex with.  I don't want to fuck you, that's for sure.  There's no way your husband fucks you. 
[03:08:00]  You dream about fucking genuine.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  What the hell if we don't?  How do you know what we do?  You fall asleep, but he puts a rolled up newspaper in your box, and he says you were terrific.  We're married for 12 years, honey, and we have good sex.  No, you don't.  It's a news week, rolled up.  When was the last time your husband went down on you?  You don't know what we have.  When was the last time your husband went down on you?  On none of your business.  When was the last time you...  Do you shave your box?  For how many hours do you have to scrub that box so it's presentable?  That's right.  Let me tell you one thing.  I look good the way I am.  How many hours does Lady Di and Marion have to scrub their boxes for it to be... 
[03:08:30]  Not me.  For it to be pleasing to the hobos.  Not me, honey.  Hey, Marion.  Shut up, Di.  Couple times a month.  Marion.  I kind of expect that from you.  Marion, do you trim your vagina?  No.  Do you shave it?  That's none of your business.  That's a no.  Ew.  Ew.  Her box looks like her head a hair.  Like her head a hair.  That's my personal and private life.  What I do.  I'm not such a private life.  Jesus, because you have said that's sexier.  Do you shave your balls, Tim?  Yes, I do. 
[03:09:00]  I shave everything.  He's talking about it on the show.  Do you never shave your balls down there?  Yeah.  Where else can my balls be, stupid?  I said yes.  Why?  Do you shave your balls?  Yes.  Do you shave your balls down there?  Oh, well, that changes everything.  You have the balls behind my ears.  Marion, yes, I do shave my balls and my cock.  There's not a hair on it.  So now, how about you?  Let's talk about your meat pocket.  Do you shave it?  When you pick up somebody, and they go to have sex with you, do they like what they say?  Yes. 
[03:09:30]  How do you know?  Because they make the goo-goo-ga-ga sound when I put it through the crib.  What's the difference?  Or do they come back for more?  Lady Di's laughing.  She has no idea what she's laughing.  Of course she doesn't.  Watch this.  Lady Di, I'll give you a chance.  You were just laughing.  What was it about?  It was about Norton standing his balls.  No.  No.  That's what it was about, right?  That's what you were laughing at?  She's on the delay.  Yeah.  No.  No.  That's not what it was.  I kind of like that.  Diana, listen. 
[03:10:00]  What?  What are you doing?  All right.  Hold on a minute.  You better get your mouth away.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me go to Sergeant McGill.  I better get my mouth away from what?  Sergeant McGill.  Hey.  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  What's up?  Well, I'm just calling to be a witness to everything that Lady Di did because myself and General  Bam over at FullBornays.com did Homeless Cribs where we went out there, too, Elizabeth.  No, no, no.  Take that off the thing.  Take that off the thing.  It's gold.  It's video gold for the Opie and Anthony show.  It's audio. 
[03:10:30]  It's great.  Why would you want to take it off if you didn't have anything to do with it?  You said you weren't living amongst the hobos, and you also said you weren't blowing hobos.  You did live on...  You did for our camera.  You walked up, and we asked you, hey, why don't you make out with Romeo and the Railroad?  And you're making out tongues with your dirty faces, hitting and grabbing your ass.  We give you guys a couple bucks, and all you do is go and buy beer, and you're like,  hey, we're going to be back on the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's drink.  That's all you guys were doing, drinking and... 
[03:11:00]  That's the last piece.  Take it off.  Fuck.  I'm telling you right now.  Take it off.  No, you gave us consent on Ken that we can use it.  Thank you.  Hey, by the way, Di, I have an idea.  Di, shh.  Di, I have an idea.  Since you're being so honest with everybody, here's what we're going to do.  We're going to have somebody find out your son, and we want to send him a link to that video.  No.  Why not? 
[03:11:30]  No, no, no.  Why?  Don't do that.  Why not?  Don't do that.  Why would that be bad?  I mean, since you said you don't...  Embarrassing.  What's that?  It's embarrassing.  Why?  I thought you said you weren't an embarrassment to your son.  Okay, that's the actual video.  No, that part is embarrassing.  Why?  I don't think he would really like that part.  Well, too bad.  Oh, well.  We're going to make sure he gets the link.  We don't want to bother him.  We just want to show him what an awful embarrassment his mother is so he can just realize...  And he should just cut you out of his life completely.  Yeah.  Jim.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:12:00]  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Hey, Jimmy.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  A lot of people make mistakes, and six months later or a year later...  Yeah, I understand that.  Stop being such a...  Hey, let me ask you, Marion.  Marion, which one of your parents is an alcoholic?  Neither.  Not anymore.  Who...  Not anymore.  Okay.  No, no, no.  That makes sense.  Marion, explain that.  Aren't you always an alcoholic?  You're just like...  Of course.  Of course.  You're just like...  Marion, come on.  Marion, explain that.  I was a drinker one time. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, I was.  You are?  Now, which one of your parents drank?  Neither.  You said not anymore.  Neither.  None of them ever drank?  No.  So...  Who in your life was close to you that's a complete alcoholic, that you're such a codependent?  A lot of people.  I'm not saying, okay?  Okay, yeah, I'm not saying.  Obviously.  I'd rather not.  I know.  You want to fix them, and they're just unfixable, and now you're trying to fix this mess, and  you can't.  Well, I can a little bit, because let me tell you...  Stop trying to fix people.  She's not as bad as she used to be.  Will you stop making excuses? 
[03:13:00]  How has your whole life been about making excuses for other people's drunkenness?  Can you just stop it?  Enable her.  Please.  Stop enabling and fucking try to make love happen.  Talk about her.  Talk about her.  I don't care.  I do care.  Who in your life was the drinker?  Who in your life?  Not her kids.  I was a drinker at one time, and I made a lot of mistakes that I regret.  I know you did.  The last day I do.  I know.  Now, who else in your life?  Who?  Wait, I want to hear some of the mistakes.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you ever wake up with a black one in your mouth?  No, I never woke up with anything in my mouth. 
[03:13:30]  Size queen.  I made a lot of friggin' mistakes in my life, and I'm not going to say doing what.  Why?  Because that was 20 years ago, way before I met my husband.  What'd you do?  No, not going to say.  Why?  Abortions.  No, I never got pregnant and had an abortion, believe me.  Well, why won't you say?  We're open about our lives here.  You're a part of the show.  You know why?  Because I got drunk.  She got so many abortions, they gave her that card.  Like you get at the yogurt shop after your ninth one, the tenth one's free.  They punch her after each abortion. 
[03:14:00]  No, no.  You were a bad girl, weren't you, Marion?  You really want to know what I used to do when I used to get drunk.  Yeah?  And I regret it.  And then what?  What else?  I used to get drunk in bars and have fights, okay?  Ooh.  I used to be one of those people that would get drunk and fuck like that.  What would you do?  You'd feel like you were being attacked by a fucking rhino with a Down syndrome wig,  and then you realized you just punched a mirror?  I used to throw all kinds of crap at people, all right?  I was tough and violent.  I can't shake this one. 
[03:14:30]  I never picked anybody up and fucked anybody.  Listen to me, you fucking Jim Henson character.  I always fought with people.  I know why she fought with people, because she got so smashed and no one wanted her.  Yeah, not at all.  She had to get that anger out somehow.  Because it's not like that.  Everybody I hung out with knew me and knew who I was.  But they, except for some people, tried to pick me up and I'd have a fight.  Why would you always argue?  You'd have to convince people that you are indeed a mammal?  No, I'm not a mammal.  All right, look.  Jesus. 
[03:15:00]  No, I'm not a mammal.  No, I'm not a mammal that you regret it.  That's the greatest.  Wait, Marianne, why else would you fight?  When you'd walk through the subway with your burlap hat on and kids would throw rocks at you?  What did you do?  That made you stop drinking the way you did.  What's that?  What made, what was your fault?  That you decided no more to alcohol.  I've discussed that a thousand times.  Yeah, he has.  It's redundant.  He has.  It's redundant.  He has.  And I got tired of being sick.  Every time I could throw up, I got tired of throwing up and throwing up and throwing up. 
[03:15:30]  And that was enough.  It was enough.  And I was only in my 20s when I was doing that.  Can we please move on?  I've had enough of these.  I was in my 20s.  Well, you want to know?  I know I did.  And your life is...  I don't know how alcoholism can be uninteresting, but congratulations.  All right, Marianne, here's bored me with alcoholism.  Marianne, here's the deal.  We want you to continue supporting the show and we'll put you on from time to time.  Oh, I love you.  Believe me.  We think you bring still some stuff to the program.  Lady Di, on the other hand, I don't know what to tell you, but we're really sick of taking  your phone calls. 
[03:16:00]  I'm hoping I could come visit you guys before Christmas.  We would love that, Marianne.  Hoping.  Can I come up there, too?  Marianne, we would love for you to come by around the holidays and say hi, you know?  Can I bring Diane?  Here.  She's not working.  What about me?  We just said you, Marianne.  You can come whenever you want.  Yeah, Marianne, no problem.  Anytime, okay?  No, no, no.  I'm talking about me.  What about me?  Bring your lovely husband.  We heard you, Marianne.  You.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you, guys. 
[03:16:30]  It's nice to know these guys still like me.  We absolutely still love you, Marianne.  You and your husband.  It's wonderful you guys have been together so long.  You seem like you really care and love each other still.  We do.  And, you know, you come out to all our stuff and support us.  We try.  I know you do, man.  You do a lot for the show.  What about me?  So, Marianne, you come up before the holidays, okay?  We'll try.  What about me?  Maybe drink some eggnog with us and stuff.  What about me?  Anthony.  Maybe even me and you will even step under the mistletoe just for a goof.  Oh, Hopi, I'd fucking hug you that day in Columbus and you were going to throw a bottle of water at me. 
[03:17:00]  Hey, what about me?  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  The good old days, right?  Right, Marianne?  Yeah, you were going to throw a bottle of water at me.  Say, you're still part of this radio show.  And, Di, what about you?  I'll hang a mistletoe over a fucking Amtrak.  Come on, God.  You can fucking kiss it.  Just like the eggnog.  Smooch, smooch.  We'll be up there, too.  Come on, guys.  Hey, guys, have a happy Thanksgiving.  I love you, Zola.  Marianne, we'll have you up here soon, okay? 
[03:17:30]  I hope so.  Yeah, absolutely.  We have no problem with you whatsoever.  I've got to get some vacation time off of work in December.  Yeah, we would love to see you, all right?  I've got to see how my schedule is.  All right, Dr. Morobody.  See you soon.  Bye, Jim.  I love you.  Yeah, we love you, Marianne.  You know that.  I know.  I love you, too.  Yeah.  And, Jim, if I could bring Diane, that would be nice.  But I'll make sure she ain't drinking when I bring her.  No, that's okay.  You can leave her home.  Just you and your husband, Marianne.  Just you, Marianne.  You and your husband.  All right.  Okay. 
[03:18:00]  No, we do not want to go, too.  All right, Marianne.  Thank you, Marianne.  Bye.  Bye.  Love you.  Happy Thanksgiving, guys.  Oh, you too, Marianne.  We're cooking Thursday.  Only the best for you and your family, all right?  That's right, Marianne.  Cooking Thursday.  All right.  You want to know what I'm cooking?  Turkey?  No, veau parmesan.  Oh, yeah.  Telling you.  Because my husband's birthday is Saturday.  Oh.  Oh, happy birthday.  How old?  I'm not going to say how old.  And we're going to Atlantic City Saturday.  Hey, Lady Di, how old would have...  Yeah.  I'm not going to say how old Joe is.  How old would your man be if he didn't step in front of a train? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  All right, Marianne.  God bless.  God bless.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  All right.  See you soon, Marianne.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I can't stand this.  He would have been 44 like me.  So, uh...  Oh, they're gone.  Lady Di's gone.  Come on, guys.  Let me go up there, too.  Yeah, she didn't want to come up anymore.  She wants nothing to do with us anymore.  I would have had Di up until all of a sudden she doesn't want to fucking be a part of the  show.  Whatever.  All right.  We're going to get into...  Look, I love you guys.  We're going to get into the Michael Kramer Richards thing, Anthony? 
[03:19:00]  Uh, yeah.  Hold on one second.  I'm just watching the video of it.  Yeah.  Because we were wondering if there was going to be video or audio of this Michael Richards  racist speech.  Yeah.  Actually, it's at a comedy club.  It's whatever it is.  Hold on one second.  And we found some.  Uh-huh.  And I'm watching it, and people are just walking out.  Are they really?  Just getting up and walking out and saying stuff like, um, all you had...  They're yelling at the stage, all you had was Seinfeld. 
[03:19:30]  You never had no movies.  And he's like, oh, they're...  Why are they getting so pissed at him?  Well, because he was using the N-word.  Was that a black crowd?  They'd say an N-word.  Yeah, I guess he had some problem with some people in the audience.  I don't know how it transpired, but he started using the N-word.  Oh, he was using it like in anger, not in a bit.  No, I think it was in a bit at first.  And then he noticed that the people in the audience were getting angry and yelling shit 
[03:20:00]  back at him.  He said, throw him out.  And they said, yeah, he's a nigger.  He's a nigger.  Throw him out.  Something like that.  He goes, what?  You going to arrest me for saying the word?  I have to hear more.  Yeah, I actually got to hear it in context.  Can you hear it or no?  I don't know.  I can't hear it.  I just watched the video.  I alerted the team that there is audio and where it is.  Great.  Were we able to get it?  Yeah.  Are we going to get the video after the break?  That's correct.  We'll go through the story, the news story, because the news is all over it, of course,  that he's some kind of racist.  Hoppy. 
[03:20:30]  Right.  But I don't know.  If it's in a comedy club, I don't know.  Yeah, I guess we're going to go to break then.  Hoppy.  We're going to break.  Hoppy, hold on one minute.  Can I talk to you?  So we're going to take a break now.  Yeah.  Hoppy.  Um, and then we'll do the Michael Richards Kramer thing?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  I can't believe she doesn't want to be part of the show anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony, hold on.  I invited her up and she fucking wouldn't answer.  Marion said yes and then she wouldn't answer. 
[03:21:00]  She's got her problems.  Marion is very cool, though.  I want to do a whole, I want to do a whole like Lady Di and Marion reunion thing in front  of the whole audience to get like a big applause for them and Marion said yes and fucking  Di all of a sudden bailed out and wouldn't talk.  She didn't want to come.  Why wouldn't Di come?  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  She's got problems, you know, issues.  I guess, uh.  She can't get enough of that hobo cum.  I know.  She fucking loves it.  What are you talking about? 
[03:21:30]  I'm drinking.  I can't believe that Than got the kid's email address to send that link to.  That's a good job, man.  Thanks.  Yeah, I think he should probably know.  Did you send it out yet?  He should probably know what, uh.  Yeah.  He's dealing with as far as Vaughn goes.  One of her son's friends emailed us with her son's email address, so now we're just going  to send the link and just tell him, look, you know, abandon your mother.  She's awful.  Do you think she drinks hobo cum like we drink smoothies?  No, I don't.  Out of a cup?  Yeah.  She puts a catheter in like a straw and just drains the ball bag.  And you actually hear. 
[03:22:00]  Slurping.  I do not do that.  I don't do that.  All right, so we're going to take a break, and then we're going to continue with the  Opie and Anthony show with this Kramer thing.  Listen, listen, Opie, Opie.  The Michael Richards Kramer thing with the N-word tirade on stage at the Laugh Factory  in LA.  And by the way, a special surprise.  Yeah?  We have some delicious cupcakes coming on.  Oh, no.  She did not.  Cake Girl's back? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  She had a problem last week.  Oh, yeah.  Which is why she was on her way over with cupcakes, and then, you know.  See, this is why we don't need Lady Di anymore.  We got new characters to exploit.  Yep.  No, no.  Cake Lady or Cake Girl.  You need me.  Cake Girl rules.  Yeah.  Cake Girl rules.  She made an awful, awful cake.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It was just a horrific cake, and she wants now to give us cupcakes to see if she says  she can bake. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  She's really good at it.  She just made a cake without flour, water, sugar, or I think it was like dirt and sacrete.  No, she took a fucking sponge and put frosting on it and brought it in.  Yeah.  That's the beauty of this new, what's her name?  We just call her Cake Girl.  She is so cool.  She does a lot of great stuff for the radio on Lady Di.  Lady Di burnt out, I don't know, three, four years ago.  Yeah, Di Di's a one-trick Clydesdale.  I did not burn out. 
[03:23:30]  I heard that.  Oh, she certainly did.  I did not burn out.  She used to do great bits for this show, and it ends with her sucking on hobo cock.  Yep.  Sucking on hobo cock.  What?  Why don't we start a contest where we have the listeners, you know, maybe write songs  about hobo cock, yeah.  Oh, well, you're sucking on the hobo cock.  Can you dig that?  Ah.  I knew that you could.  Can you suck on that?  I knew you could.  And hobo cum was coming down like beads at Mardi Gras. 
[03:24:00]  He, he, he.  Just flying all over.  Hobo cum.  Hobo cum.  And I said, Mr. Bush, why are you so bushy?  And she said, cause she don't trim her cunt.  And I went into the Superdome and sucked every cock in there.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, stop already.  I bet you she uses hobo cum for many, many, uh, black ones.  Many, many different things.

She can use the hobo cum to put on her birthday cake.  Well, you know what it is?  She fills up the icy pop thing with hobo cum and then puts her fucking toenail clipping  to like, as the stick, a yellowing toenail clipping with a hobo load on it.  And she suckles away while watching television. 
[03:29:30]  She gives herself a summer treat.  That's a cool-down summer treat.  As it slowly melts and drips down her fingers as she's eating it.  And she's like licking her fingers up over the yellowed underside of the toenail and then  making sure that all the fucking hobo load, which is also yellow and discolored, due to  a urinary tract infection.  Not even funny.  I think that's about it.  Lice remover.  Yeah, lice remover. 
[03:30:00]  Crab remover.  Very good.  All right.  I think that's about it.  Coffee mate.  Coffee mate?  It's not milk.  Well, sure.  Okay.  A nonstick surface for a cow catcher on front of train.  Cow!  All right.  Cow catcher.  Isn't that funny?  He was one and then he got hit by one. 
[03:30:30]  Swimming earplugs is coming in from Chad in Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  All right.  I think we're just about done with this comedy pyramid.  I thought we were, too.  Comedy pyramid.  Great new bit.  What?  What?  What?  Comedy pyramid.  What?  I don't know. 
[03:31:00]  I don't like the name, though.  I'm thinking, like, a hilarity high-rise.  Sure.  Why not?  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Where we build a building, floor by floor.  That was terrific.  We'll get into the Michael Kramer Richards thing next.  I got to take a whiz.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I got to take a whiz, too, Jimmy.  All right, kids.  You got Stalker Patty drinking champagne.  You're not on.  I'm drinking champagne.  What, Kenny?  You got Stalker Patty drinking champagne out there if you want to play poke the list for 
[03:31:30]  real.  She's another one.  Hitting the sauce a little early, huh?  All right, we'll do some with Lady Di.  Funny if Patty got drunk, and you open the door, and you just see her licking Earl's balls.  Hey, get her in here for a second.  He's got those stupid black pants pulled down.  Earl is so filled with sexual shame.  He wouldn't pull his pants all the way down.  He would lower his pants to mid-thigh, where his black underwear and his stupid legs would  be open, and she would just be fucking licking his balls as he sat there like Scatman  Crothers in Nurse Ratched's office when he was passed out.  Hello.  Hey, Lady Di. 
[03:32:00]  I mean, uh, jeez, Lady Di in the brain.  Stalker Patty.  Patty.  Hi.  Are you drinking a little champagne?  Yes, I had a glass.  It's put a little rose in your cheeks.  Yeah.  Or are you wearing makeup today?  I'm wearing makeup.  You still buy it?  Oh.  Well, because I have to work, so I've got to see the customers.  Oh, I thought you were celebrating that it was the opening day of the virus.  Oh, I'm that, too.  You do know if you drive a shitty car, you shouldn't honk your horn, right?  Oh, jeez.  I don't drive, but I do know about that.  Yeah, well.  It's kind of, uh, yeah, well.  You know, figuratively speaking. 
[03:32:30]  Right.  Did somebody tell you, suggest to you at work, like, hey, Patty, why don't you try a little  makeup when you're coming to work?  Like, that wasn't your idea, right?  No.  I always put makeup on before I go out.  Well, we've seen you.  Well, I know.  No, we've seen you come here, and you've been on your way to work or other places without  makeup.  Did someone suggest?  It's the champagne.  Maybe you wear some makeup?  Well, I don't know.  Who suggested?  Nobody.  Patty.  Someone did, right?  I just did it on my own. 
[03:33:00]  I just decided to tell.  Patty, we're celebrating the launch of the name change of the channel.  That's pretty much all that's going on.  I mean, they can run promos.  They can run promos out the ass, but the reality is we just changed the name of the  channel, okay?  Yeah.  Yes, I know that.  Virus.  Congratulations.  Virus.  It's more fitting than high voltage stuff.  Oh, is it?  Why?  Why?  Because we told you?  No.  Why is it?  Why?  Because the virus is, well, spread the virus, you know?  Oh, that's pretty.  That's the theme.  We know.  Oh, yeah, good. 
[03:33:30]  Patty, we want to do something to celebrate, you know, the channel name change.  Yeah.  And you're drinking a little champagne, so you're halfway there.  What do you mean?  Can we make a bukkake video?  With you?  I don't know what a bukkake video is.  Well, before you, would you be open for possibly making a bukkake video?  It's fun and it's harmless.  What is it?  Yeah.  The video.  Yeah, it involves all of us.  Is it a video of my you-know-why?  No.  No.  No, only your face. 
[03:34:00]  Nothing bad.  No, it's just your face.  You can keep all your clothes on.  It'll just be the camera focused right on your face and you keep all your clothes on.  It's nothing like that.  All your friends will be there.  And then what happens?  Bukake.  Yeah, makeup.  I don't know what bukkake is.  It's like makeup.  Yeah, it's nothing worse than makeup.  Have you ever had like a ham sandwich, a ham and Swiss with a lot of mayo?  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  And you can't get enough of the sandwich and you dig in and all of a sudden you go, oops.  I got a little mayo on my face. 
[03:34:30]  And you go like, ooh, you know, you get a napkin or something.  That's right.  Wow.  A little milkshake on your face.  Yeah.  You ever have a milk mustache?  Right.  Something like that.  Oh, wait a minute.  I get it now.  Ew.  No.  Ew.  Are you kidding?  Pit her down.  What?  Milk?  Ew.  You ever have somebody squirt tubes?  It's disgusting.  Why?  What do you think it is?  We didn't even tell you anything.  I think it's a...  Patty, as a goof.  Wait, what is it?  I think it's semen.  It's what?  That's what I think it is.  Could be any branch of the services. 
[03:35:00]  She's the only one that would say it's semen.  Everyone else says splooge loads.  But that's what it is.  Semen.  Oh, is it semen?  What do you think the semen goes?  What do you think happens?  I'll tell you if you're right or wrong.  It goes on your face.  How do you think it gets there?  Yeah.  They do.  They shoot it there.  Oh.  Microphone.  I'm Mike.  Patty.  How do they shoot it there?  Patty.  Yeah, exactly.  Would you use the mic?  Talk to the mic.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:35:30]  He just did the song.  Here's the problem.  Patty's been with us so fucking long.  There was a split second where she thought cum was going to shoot out of that fucking microphone.  into her face and didn't want to put it in her face.  She thought we rigged the mic.  Oh, I know it doesn't come from a microphone.  Oh, wow.  What if we all jacked off in something and put it in the mic and at any time we point,  Patty, it'll shoot all over your face through the microphone.  Patty, how are your bills?  Well, they're getting there.  You're behind again, right? 
[03:36:00]  I only have doctor bills.  How much do you owe?  But you're behind.  You need a few bucks.  How much in debt are you?  You need a few bucks.  I'm about $2,000 in debt.  Dude, jeez, too large.  I got a crisp $20 bill.  Attaboy, I hope.  Attaboy.  And I'll be happy to throw in a little less than that.  I was going to give two zeros because that's what a 20 needs to become 2,000.  Excuse me.  Well, technically it was direct.  And that's what my joke needs.  Well, no, two zeros would have made it. 
[03:36:30]  Ta-da.  No, no, no, you're right.  But two zeros would have made it 200.  Patty, no, the 20.  Right.  Two zeros makes it 2,000.  Patty?  Thank you.  Oh, who's that?  What's in my rear view mirror?  Oh.  Jim Norton's catty.  I was just, all right, two zeros makes it.  Yeah, you're right.  Racist Kramer right in front of us, too.  Oh, please.  We're going long today.  Got to get to that.  You know that, right?  Why not?  It's a fucking virus celebration.  Wow, look, the show's almost over and we didn't even take a break.  I got to pee, dude, badly.  I know, but let's set this up before. 
[03:37:00]  I agree.  Fuck.  You fucking motherfuckers listening.  Remember today when you complained.  Fucking pee.  Fucking pee.  Pee.  Go fuck off.  Give me a bucket.  I'll pee right here.  I don't care.  Thank you.  I don't know who you are.  Yeah, let's get some.  We're just going to pee right here.  If she doesn't want semen, maybe she wants some tinkle.  You want some piss thrown over your head?  Can we piss and bucket and throw it over your head?  Patty.  No.  Wow.  Patty, it's not that bad.  We're going to do deal or no deal on the Opie and Anthony show.  She made a fucking Tor Johnson face.  How much money do we got? 
[03:37:30]  How much money do we got?  What's going to happen?  How about we make, all I want to do today is have a video made, a mock.  We want to just do, look at all the money.  Look at all the money.  Wow.  How much money is out there?  Kenny, go look real fast.  You're lucky because we have a huge studio audience today.  There's probably, what?  I would say close to 50 people outside the studio right now.  Probably, uh...  Everybody's got a 20. 
[03:38:00]  Everybody's in for a 20.  How much real fast?  Seriously.  Oh, wow.  A hundred?  Billy's got a hundred.  Wow.  I know what I'd like to do.  I mean...  I got it.  I think.  If I don't, then, uh, then, then...  I think you guys will add to it, though.  What's the idea?  We want to make, Patty, a mock Bukkake video with you.  Boo-mocky.  Boo-mocky.  Mock-ocky.  All you would have to do is...  She just has to lay down, right?  Lay down. 
[03:38:30]  Okay, lay down.  Yeah.  And then we just happen to pour some things on your face.  What would it be?  Mayonnaise.  Nah, mayo ain't good.  It doesn't look like it.  Not the consistency.  It doesn't look like it.  What did they say they used?  What did they say they used?  All right.  Uh, hair lotion.  Like Juergens?  Yeah.  It's got to be the right one.  It can't be the yellowy stuff.  Why?  Somebody that made, like...  That could be the homo cum.  Somebody had made...  We were talking to somebody in Penthouse. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  At Penthouse.  And they make fake cum out of something.  Yeah.  It's like a little bit of corn syrup.  And then...  What made the white?  I think they really did use some lotion.  Damn it.  Seriously.  It was a lotion product.  I think lotion was part of it.  Right.  But if it's just all lotion, it's not going to have that consistency.  But if we all just got lotion and...  And just...  It's on her face and we all just start spraying it.  And spraying it and spraying it.  What do you think? 
[03:39:30]  I know what I'm...  How much would it cost to make a Maka Bukkake video with you?  I don't know.  As long as it's fake and not real, that's fine.  What is that?  What is that?  Butter.  That's the best we could do, right?  That's after a fucking...  No, it's like egg whites.  That could actually be...  Oh, it's egg whites.  That could be part of it.  Oh!  Egg whites was part of it.  Egg whites, dude.  Egg whites, but now it needs some kind of a...  We don't need to make it accurate.  We just want to make it look silly.  We want egg whites.  It's a sci-fi of...  Oh, it's a whiteout.  No, we all...  We want lotion. 
[03:40:00]  We want egg whites.  We want mayonnaise just for the hell of it.  Like different consistency loads.  The only thing is I can't get dirty because I've got to be at work today.  Oh, no.  What time?  What time are you going to make today?  What time?  I don't know.  But...  You can wash your hair under the sink.  What time you got to be at work?  Not until 11.30, quarter to 12.  I told them I was coming late.  I was going to say if it's enough time for you to actually wash your hair.  Everyone is screaming egg whites, egg whites, egg whites. 
[03:40:30]  What if we add some milk to it?  All right.  And what?  Some milk.  Oh, it's good for your skin.  Yeah, milk.  And some egg white might work a little bit.  Do they got a little, like, a little flour out there?  Flour?  Thicken it up a little bit?  All right.  We're going to make a Bukkake video with Stalker Patty.  Bumaki.  Bumaki.  Yes.  Everyone's applauding.  Yeah.  How much money have we got?  I got 20 so far.  I'll throw in some more.  I don't care.  Patty, just out of curiosity, would you...  I wouldn't want to do anything really sexual with you, but would you allow me nothing horrible 
[03:41:00]  to take my dick, wouldn't be hard, and slap you on the cheek with it?  I want to slap Patty with my dick.  You do.  Not...  I don't want to hurt you.  I don't want to...  Just a gentle tap.  Just like one of these.  It will slide this.  It would be the closest I've ever gotten to one.  Now, you and I have had an interesting history.  Yes.  I helped you through your first orgasm.  I touched your nipples. 
[03:41:30]  I was the first guy to ever touch your nipples, and I'm always nice.  I never do anything awful to you.  I never go too far.  Whatever you don't want, I don't do.  You put a glove on and...  You jerked me off.  And jerked it a few times.  Remember, it wasn't bad.  You jerked him off a little bit.  You cupped his balls.  And I just got tested, by the way, if you're paranoid.  Honestly, I have no...  I was tested for AIDS, chlamydia, gonorrhea.  I have nothing.  I don't want to put it in your mouth.  I know.  All I want to do is like this.  You want to.  I want to do this.  These two have a connection.  A gentle slap.  A weird one, but it's a connection.  But she knows she can trust me. 
[03:42:00]  I'm not going to hurt her.  You want to be her first.  It won't be hard.  My dick won't be hard.  Believe me, it won't.  But I just want to...  What do you say, Patty?  I think the audio...  All right, I'll go along with the gag as long as it doesn't hurt me.  It won't hurt you.  Wow.  I have to...  I can't...  We'll come back.  I'll do that.  All right, man.  You got a little...  You know, you have to take a leak.  It makes it look better.  No, it doesn't.  He's going to work it a little, I bet.  Trust me.  Get it a little plump.  Like a ballpark prank.  All right, listen.  We have to do the Kramer stuff.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But we have to make the bukkake.  Can we get the boys to get some ingredients? 
[03:42:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, what is that?  That's like what?  Egg whites and milk?  Egg whites and milk a little...  Yeah, it's healthy.  It's not bad.  That actually...  Yeah?  That actually looks pretty good.  Good.  Not good in a tasty way.  What?  But that...  Yeah, that...  Dude, but we want some different ingredients.  It's delicious.  We need mayo.  Yes.  We need...  What else?  Something black to shoot it out of.  Lotion.  Lotion.  Then you're going to get somebody to get some products before...  Because we have to do this right away so she can clean up for work. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  All right, we're going to make a bukkake video with Starca Patty after the break.  All right?  Nice.  By the way, Rosen's Restaurant and Caterers, East 51st Street between 5th and Madison, 212-371-7676.  They're applying all the food that we're going to use in the bukkake video.  All right?  Very good.  Let's all take leeks together.  Well, could Jay Moore do the show while we take a...  No, he hung up.  Where did he go?  I was going to just have him do the show while we take a leek. 
[03:43:30]  We're going to take a break.  Hey, are we getting the ingredients?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We're going to make the bukkake video with Starca Patty next.  Opie and Anthony.  This ain't your mama's radio show.  Bitch.  Do you understand that nobody likes you?  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony virus, it's the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour.  A different show each week featuring new bits thought up by the staff of the Opie and Anthony 
[03:44:00]  show.  You can tell it's going to suck.  The Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour premieres Saturday at 10 a.m. with replays throughout the weekend.  You certainly didn't ask for it, but we know you'll listen to it.  All right.  We're goofing off today.  Bring in Starca Patty. 
[03:44:30]  We're going to make a mock bukkake video with Starca Patty.  In honor of the channel changing to the virus.  Are there any people out there that do you think don't know what bukkake is?  Bukake is a Japanese art form.  You've seen the videos.  Well, if you did, then you would know what bukkake is.  There are videos out there where it's usually some chick and she's a face shot and it's  just load after load of cum flying into her face, either out of numerous dicks or sometimes 
[03:45:00]  a bunch of guys jerk off into a glass and then she pours it on her face and drinks it  and shit like that.  But bukkake is just an enormous amount of cum dumped on a woman's face.  So we're going to make a mock one.  Yeah.  We're going to do a mock one with you, Patty.  We're ready to do it for real, but you're just a party pooper.  Well, you'll lay down.  Now, here's what's going to... 
[03:45:30]  Is that me?  Who the fuck's calling it?  A gay men's health crisis with that ring?  Ew.  What ring is that?  That's for the text thing.  There are only three choices on this and the other two are even worse.  Patty, you're going to have to sell this, though.  You're going to have to sell it.  I don't want to...  Now, should we rehearse a little bit?  Because I want to hear it go like, oh, yeah, give it to me.  Oh, mm, I love this.  Yeah, come on my face.  Shit like that.  This is going to be great audio for you guys to cut up for later. 
[03:46:00]  Me just saying that.  Just kidding.  Next promo.  I'm putting it together.  Yeah.  But you do understand you're going to have to make this like it's a sexual thing and  you're really getting off on it.  All right.  I think I can...  You think you can act?  It's acting.  Yeah.  You don't even have to use your hands.  Like, give it to me, big boy.  Yeah.  As it's happening, like right before, you're going to have to be like, give it to me, give  it to me.  And then as it's happening, you've got to moan with pleasure and, oh, yeah, pump those  hot loads in my face. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, my God, Anna.  Are you nuts?  I'm giving myself up for the bit.  I would just like...  I wanted to, you know, I want to motivate this girl.  Future intro.  Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  Believe me.  That's why I don't say anything anymore.  I can't.  I can't be messed.  What?  Line two has...  Line two.  It's funny when you hear it being played back and you've got a cock in your mouth.  Yeah.  You can't even talk.  That nasally laugh.  Tony, Rivoli's, Tom's River. 
[03:47:00]  What's up?  We love your restaurant.  Hey, Tony.  How are you doing today?  All right, Tony.  Thank you so much.  Sure.  I want to put up $200 for Patty's video.  200 bucks.  Oh, 200 bucks.  How is she going to get it?  Nice.  When can I come up?  You're welcome anytime, sir.  Anytime you want to come up.  Patty, he's going to give you $200.  Wow.  Very cool.  Nice.  Thanks, Tony.  You're welcome.  Rivoli's, Tom's River.  Okay, guys.  All right.  Rivoli's, Tom's River.  You'll love it. 
[03:47:30]  There you go.  You got it.  Definitely $200, and then we're going to collect money from the peanut gallery here.  Yep.  Who's collecting money?  Call us over to Kenny.  Guys, you know.  Kenny, get a hat.  I'll collect the money.  Make believe we're in church.  Get a hat and pass it around.  You know, I don't want to be negative, but XM should have donated something.  Yeah, that's it.  Look, I don't want to be a bother, but, you know, we've got to take collections for these  things.  All right. 
[03:48:00]  All right.  They're collecting.  He's passing a hat around.  It is like a church collection.  Dude, if you can't afford it, don't worry about it.  We're all giving generous.  Just get out.  None of them can afford it.  What are you kidding?  True.  XM rapes these poor people.  I know.  $12.99 a month for this dreck.  Drivel.  It really is.  Stuff we never get to and shit we make up along the way.  Verbal diarrhea.  Throw mine in.  Yeah.  Here you go.  I'm going to post my own negative message about myself and then pull it off.  I've got to take some change.  Here you go.  All right. 
[03:48:30]  I guess I've got to put something in.  A dollar?  That's right.  I'm throwing in a buck.  Boy, you had a good weekend in Vegas.  All right.  Yeah, I'll throw you 20.  All right.  Here we go.  There's 20 in that filthy hatchet.  There's another 20.  Ten count.  Plus, uh, Revolie's 200.  Now, Stalker Patty, we've got to make a rule here.  You have to last, what, a minute?  45 minutes.  Two minutes?  Let me count.  That's worse.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's got to be some kind of time thing where she's just got to lay there. 
[03:49:00]  Patty, you have to just lay there and take it.  And if you get up before the two minutes is up, kiss the money goodbye.  You want to go two minutes?  How about 90 seconds?  That's good compromise.  Let's go 90 seconds, all right?  Let's get the stopwatch.  And you have to talk to it, Patty.  Yeah, like it's really sexy.  Yeah, we got to get a mic on you, all right?  All right.  Sam, put the mic on.  Let's hear a little bit of practice run.  Yeah, go ahead.  Everyone be quiet.  Oh, give it to me.  Oh, come on.  More.  Oh, I love it.  Is that okay?  No, you got to be a little, hey, give me your load. 
[03:49:30]  I want some more seed.  Make it dirty talk.  Like, talk about loads and talk about in my face and where it's coming out of.  How about this?  Yeah, treat my face like a pussy.  You know, like when you're rubbing your foot in the bathtub.  I don't take baths, I take showers.  All right, listen.  Jimmy's going to smack you in the face with his penis first.  He's going to give you a little love tap.  What the hell happened to us?  I don't know. 
[03:50:00]  You can put it up.  They're not going to see it.  Okay.  It should be here.  All right, get on your knees, pal.  And now that, cover those up.  I don't trust those.  Okay, Doc, they're disconnected.  All right.  Who disconnected them?  They're definitely disconnected?  Oh, don't you worry about it.  I can see, yeah.  All right.  All right, Patty, get on your knees.  Pal talk cameras.  No, that's not working today.  Okay.  No, no.  This far one, but you're not going to see from there either.  All right, Patty.  We won't mess you up.  Bye-bye.  Now, my dick is not hard.  Jimmy, explain, because people might be tuning in for the first time here today. 
[03:50:30]  Now, Patty has never had a penis in her face.  No, never.  And all I want to do is give her a little slap on the cheek with my dick.  A little, nothing crazy.  Tap, tap.  It's going to be the first time she's ever, no, it's okay.  It's the first time she's ever had a penis on her face.  All right.  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  You ready?  I'm ready.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I'm not going to have a hard on.  Okay.  Yes.  Don't worry.  This isn't what they look like.  Oh, she's peeking, Jimmy.  She's looking to her left.  That was your finger right through.  She's getting very curious as to what they look like. 
[03:51:00]  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Put your face down a little bit.  Tilt it this way.  I'll hit your glasses.  Tilt it this way.  Like that.  Like that.  Okay.  What is wrong with you?  If I was right before, I'm right now.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with Jimmy?  That made a great little slap sound. 
[03:51:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, did that make a good smacking noise?  That's terrific.  I wish I would have had a rod.  That would have been a fucking gem.  Yeah.  But please don't ask for miracles.  All right.  Were you watching, Patty?  I kind of.  Well, I couldn't help but see it.  My eyes are right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got a good one, right?  Is this my camera?  She wouldn't know.  Turn my mic.  All right.  It can be two inches or four feet. 
[03:52:00]  She's got nothing to compare it to.  She has no idea.  All right.  Let's go make our bukkake video.  Oh, we've got to go outside.  Yeah, we've got to do it in front of the crowd that's outside the studio today.  We've got like 50, 60 people up here today celebrating the name change of the channel.  It's now called The Virus.  Yeah.  Look at you.  Look at you.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  I am on.  Jim. 
[03:52:30]  Gather around, everybody.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  A little plastic is down.  For all the people that brought cameras, this will be a photo op.  Yes.  In your tour of the Opie and Anthony facility.  Let's get over here.  Oh, good.  All right.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Hey, how many video cameras we got on this?  We got some.  Only one.  We better have.  We should do a two-camera shoot here.  I agree.  Two-camera shoot.  All right. 
[03:53:00]  This has to be done professionally.  Yeah, we need a two-camera shoot just in case.  It's not that I doubt your abilities, but it's got to be right on our face.  Patty, do you want to take this off?  How much fucking tape and plastic?  We're not shooting someone in lethal weapon, too.  You can't get.  You're not going to.  That shirt.  You can't get any of the props, you know?  Hey, wait.  Do we have a...  Legs are good because then it'll look like people are around her if you want to shoot that  way.  Patty.  I'm directing.  Patty, you're not going to be able to wear that shirt when this is done. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, I know.  No.  I have another shirt full.  All right.  Why don't you change shirts real fast?  Okay.  You got a bra on today, hopefully?  No.  I don't wear bras.  We know that because I don't have anything.  We know that, she says.  Change.  You don't mind if everyone gets pictures of your boobies because...  She's done it before.  She doesn't care.  She's an old hat.  She looks like Vera from Alice if she was even more unfuckable.  Ew.  Oh, what is that?  Oh, she's going to try to do this.  Patty, you could show it off. 
[03:54:00]  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Come on.  Give her a nice round of vomit.  Patty, you look good.  Elliot.  Yeah.  Elliot.  I'm lying.  I'm lying.  Leave me alone.  Jesus.  They're not bad.  I'm telling you.  They're not bad, Patty.  Patty, do you have scoliosis?  No, it's backwards, Patty.  Nothing?  Patty, it's backwards.  A little bit.  Yeah, it doesn't matter. 
[03:54:30]  It's backwards, Patty.  No, keep it like that.  That's fine.  Keep it like that.  That's fine.  My brother's design is quite lovely.  All right.  All right.  Are we rolling?  We got our fake cum?  Yeah, it's over there.  I wish we could get the real stuff.  In cup loads.  Patty, you want to wear your glasses?  We can wash them off.  It'll protect your eyes.  Yeah, you'll probably show you your glasses.  It'll protect your eyes.  Yeah, I think so.  You can always wash it off.  Yeah, you'll be able to wash off your glasses.  You're going to have to keep your eyes kind of shut because you don't want it to get in  your eyes.  All right.  Are you nervous? 
[03:55:00]  Yes.  A little bit.  What are you nervous about?  I've never done anything like this before.  Never done.  All right.  Sam, why don't you roll video?  What do I do?  What are we going to do?  All right.  All right.  We're rolling video for the websites.  Stalker Patty's laying down.  We're getting ready for our mock Bukkake video with Stalker Patty.  Who's going to be the pourers? 
[03:55:30]  Us three.  Who else wants to pour?  Everyone's putting up their...  Yeah, everyone wants to...  A lot of angry volunteers.  Exactly.  Do we have the...  The real thing.  We have the stopwatch?  Yeah.  Where is it?  Official timer?  Boy, if that's not the fucking sexy face you normally see in a Bukkake video, it's like  jerking off on a cadaver.  Did I wear something around my head?  Yes, a noose.  Hey.  Like a pillow?  Club Soda.  Where's Kenny?  Right here.  So I don't get too much in my hair. 
[03:56:00]  How much money did we collect?  173.  Plus 200.  Nice.  I got one for 180 right here.  Huh?  180 right here.  180?  Seven more dollars.  So you're going to get 170 plus the 200 from Rivoli.  That's right.  That's $200.  And maybe more if you make it look good.  I might be good for another like five.  All right.  Than's going to be the official timer.  Fucking those are the worst socks a house should be on her body.  All right.  Here we go. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, here it is.  This one?  How are we supposed to squirt it?  This is horrible.  You just got to kind of dump it and make it look like it's shooting.  You have to look into the camera because we're making a video.  Yeah, so you look right into the camera and talk to the camera as if it's a bunch of guys.  Right.  That are ready to, you know, spew.  All right.  You ready, Patty?  Hold on a minute.  Wait a minute.  I have a question.  Yeah.  Is her eyes going to be open?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:57:00]  Then here's what we have to do.  Someone has to.  Can we want her to say certain things?  Is there a way we can somehow hold signs for things for her to say off camera?  Because she won't know what to say.  Someone's got to fucking be able to write something down for her to say.  She's not going to be able to say it within like seconds.  Patty, all right.  Why don't you practice again?  What are you going to say to the camera?  Oh, bring it on.  Oh, baby.  Yes.  Yes.  Talk about.  I don't know.  Talk about coxin.  Treat my face.  No, like I said, but treat my face like a pussy.  Yeah, say that.  Okay.  Go ahead. 
[03:57:30]  Treat my face like a pussy.  There you go.  Treat my face like a toilet.  Pussy.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, fine.  Here we go.  It's the Stalker Patty mock Bukkake video.  Keep the mic out of the shot.  And...  That's all right.  Go.  Now talk about it.  You've got to look at the camera.  Stop it.  Look just at the camera.  Now say, ooh, make sexy faces and do the whole, ooh, give it to me.  I want it.  Sam, you could straddle her. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Patty, here's the deal.  You get up.  You don't get the money, okay?  You just look into that camera lens and make love to it.  Where are you framing her?  From where to where?  Tell me when I'm in frame.  Say it, Patty.  Oh, wow.  That far?  Okay, here?  You're going to have to go over.  Go over.  All right, you ready?  Yeah.  Kind of.  All right, here we go.  Once again, Stalker Patty's mock Bukkake video.  Look into the lens.  Look into the lens and say some.  Hello.  Are you ready for a sexy time? 
[03:58:30]  You had to turn on.  Make believe you're turned on.  You're looking at.  What?  I'm turned on like a light bulb.  You're so alone.  Oh, God.  She stinks.  All right, stop the clock.  Oh, Patty.  Patty?  You've got to help us out a little here.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  She's a freak.  We've got to talk about loads.  Give it to me, big boy.  All right.  All right, here we go.  Should they be yelling in the background or should they be quiet? 
[03:59:00]  Laughing is one thing.  Eh, whatever.  Okay.  Because we've got the Stalker Patty mock Bukkake video.  Go ahead, Patty.  Oh, give it to me.  Give it to me good.  Grab the shot.  Oh, I like that.  Oh, I like that.  Come on.  Keep talking.  Say, use my face like it's over.  I'll be shy. 
[03:59:30]  Oh.  Say it.  Excuse me.  Say it.  I want that big black cock.  I want that big black cock.  Wait, say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Ready for it?  Here it comes.  I want that big black cock.  I want that big black cock.  Here it is.  Oh.  Here it is, baby.  Oh, my God. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, my hemorrhoid! 
[04:00:30]  Oh, my hemorrhoid!  Take some more!  How much time left?  Oh, my hemorrhoid.  Oh, my hemorrhoid.  Wait.  Oh, my hemorrhoid.  Oh, my God! 
[04:01:00]  It's hot!  Nice.  All right, Patty.  Get up.  Patty!  Patty!  Patty!  Patty!  Patty!  You can get up, Patty.  Say something, Patty.  Oh, turn your ear.  Turn your head the other way.  It's all in your ear.  Yeah.  Give me a patty.  One of the other for real next time.  Now, I say, no trip to the bathroom.  We make her leave like that. 
[04:01:30]  You can't stay?  No.  All right.  Wipe the load out of your eyes, whore.  Why don't you raise your hand, Patty?  Patty.  There you go.  It's in a rear view.  Let's hear it for Stalker Party.  Yeah!  Wow.  Stalker Party.  Stalker Party.  Stalker Party.  I mean, it's the virus show.  What's that?  It looks like the fake blood you throw on me at the virus show.  Yeah.  We'll have to explain.  We started with like the egg whites and stuff that looked pretty real. 
[04:02:00]  Then we went on to yogurt and smoothies and fruit.  That's the point where an entire box of cereal.  Box of cereal.  It looked nothing like cum.  No, not at all.  Total strawberries.  Total green.  Honey.  Oh, we did spill the honey?  Yeah.  I was trying to hide the honey.  Honey?  Yeah, you got honey.  Yeah, you're a mess.  You are a fucking mess.  How'd it feel, Patty?  Weird.  Just imagine if it was the real thing, you know? 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  How hot that would be.  Is that hot, Patty?  All right.  Well, she's cleaning up.  There you go.  Starker Patty and the mock Bukkake video.  All right.  Oh, was that good?  Thanks, whore.  Whore?  I didn't feel good about this.  By the end of that, I didn't feel good about this.  Again.  Once again.  I start with the money?  I start.  No.  Yeah, of course give her the money.  Yeah, give her the money.  We got a Purell. 
[04:03:00]  I got that gookie on my hands and I'm grossed out.  Oh, is that funny?  I started to not feel so good about things.  Well, as she's laying there, she looked like some type of a pod person.  Yeah.  She's laying there in this mess with her in a fetal position.  She was a complete mess.  And I'm like, what are we doing?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm fine.  I didn't get much.  Let's freak out.  I said one guy actually, you know.  Jay O'd in one of the clubs.  Oh, yeah, that's pretty good.  That's true.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  We got to present her the money on the air. 
[04:03:30]  Make sure Kenny doesn't give her the money.  Of course.  Don't give her the money.  Patty.  Oh, God, that was funny.  Wait till you, you know, it's another visual thing, but it will be up on YouTube.  Believe me.  Yeah.  Patty.  I think the sounds are pretty good, though.  What happened was, just to fill in the pictures, she was laying there and we started with the  nice egg white mixture that looked pretty damn real.  Yeah.  And we started with a little bit and then we just started dumping all the cups on.  And we had about ten of those.  Some of them, like, were half full.  Yeah. 
[04:04:00]  So it was kind of, you could really do the good jizz kind of pump action.  Yeah.  But then there were full cups that Opie just did the first one.  Dumped the entire cup all in one shot.  Looked like it was fired out of a cannon.  Well, when Jimmy said...  And the yogurt.  Well, when Jimmy said, give me that big black cock or whatever, the load he dumped on her.  Well, I knew.  I jerked the cup.  Wait, where are my glasses?  How great would it be if someone stepped on him and broke him?  Yeah. 
[04:04:30]  Patty, we want to present you with the money.  You were very good.  Yes.  What a mess you are.  I was a sport.  You were a sport.  Well, we'll see what kind of sport you really were.  Yeah.  We don't know how you're going to take this, Patty.  You better sit down.  You know there's always a twist.  I can't sit down.  Yes, you can't.  She's a mess.  Always a twist.  You better take that shirt off.  With the O&A show.  Take the shirt off.  I have to.  Yeah, take it off.  We've seen your tits before.  Well, who cares?  Get her shirt.  We'll leave her shirt out there.  Yeah, Patty.  We've seen your breasts.  There we go.  Patty, what was the worst part?  What was the worst part?  I don't know. 
[04:05:00]  I think it went into my nose.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  And then I felt like hard things.  It was marmalade?  Marmalade?  You didn't tell me about the marmalade.  Well, they looked like marmalade.  Marmalade.  Who the fuck had marmalade?  What year is this?  They retired marmalade.  Marmalade?  Yeah.  I think I was hit with a praline.  Did somebody dump pig frames on me?  No.  Some kind of honey, marmalade, something like that. 
[04:05:30]  Something like that.  And a birch beer peppermint stick.  Yeah, yeah.  Honey, marmalade, whatever.  It was that sticky.  Birch beer.  You fucking 1800s ass.  She really is awful.  And some freshly churned butter.  And then I was drowning in it.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the object.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  Honey.  And some sweet bread.  Sweet bread.  When I go into the bathroom, someone's got to keep all the people out while I just wash 
[04:06:00]  at the sink.  Yeah.  We'll do that.  We'll do that.  But we want to present you with the money.  We pulled a fast one on you, Patty.  Well, you know how there's always a twist on this radio show, right?  Yeah.  There's always been a twist.  Yeah.  Well, this was...  We'd like to...  We'd like for you...  Now, you see how many people are out there, right?  Yeah.  And in here, we'd like you to pick out the one guy...  Uh-uh.  There were two.  Two?  Two.  All right.  The two guys that actually jerked off into one of those pups. 
[04:06:30]  Oh, no.  You didn't.  Yep.  Yep, we did, Patty.  Point them out.  Two guys.  Two guys actually...  Actually...  They're all going to say they didn't.  One of them you know.  That's right.  And one of them is unclipped and not white.  And you do know you could get pregnant through your nose, right?  That's a very...  You didn't get any in your nose.  Hey, it can.  You get nasal passages.  The other thing is diseases.  Very thin membrane in there through the blood.  It could get into the blood and go to your uterus. 
[04:07:00]  That's not true.  Through your circulatory system.  Besides, I can't get pregnant.  Why?  I'm already going through my changes.  Yeah, but that doesn't matter.  That'll change you right back.  Her vagina is turning into Dracula when he sees the sunlight.  It's just going to be crumbled dust with panties around it.  I got to get into the bathroom.  I'm sticky.  Doesn't it bother you that somebody threw real semen on you?  I hope not.  Wow.  I hope it doesn't bother you.  Yeah, she doesn't seem that bothered by you. 
[04:07:30]  No, what a trooper.  She's changed a lot.  Yeah.  She just smacked her a cock today and took some fucking bukkake in.  She's like, where's the bathroom?  That was nice.  Give me the cash.  I cannot wait to see the video of that.  I know.  Because I'm sure it'll just be hysterical.  I like the slow build from just a couple of loads to a huge amount.  The yogurt was hysterical because I believe it was fruit at the bottom.  That's what it was.  Yogurt.  Yeah.  Yogurt.  That's it.  That's what they call it.  I had to figure something out.  Because I know it was something thick and wide. 
[04:08:00]  It was the yogurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was the yogurt.  Can I get, like, a shirt so I could go into the sink?  Sure, Patty.  You could do that.  You know, I'll do it in the back.  Why don't you go to the back sink?  Because there's room, right?  She could do her hair, right?  She can wash her hair?  Yeah, you can wash her hair.  Yeah, go wash.  Go wash.  Give that woman a shirt or something to put over her.  Yeah.  Give her the money.  Show her the money.  I got it right here.  I just wanted to hand it to her when she was clean.  There you go.  All right.  Yeah. 
[04:08:30]  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  There you go, Patty.  Once again, you're a good earner.  Thanks.  You are.  You're one of our top earners.  You really are.  Top earners.  You're one of our top earners.  Can I, like, get a shirt or something to just...  Somebody's getting you a shirt.  Yeah.  I like the fact that Patty got a little impatient with fucking Fannikins.  Yeah.  Hey, asshole.  Sure.  Fannikins.  Let's go to Lindsey in Connecticut.  Lindsey, what's up?  I see you want an ugly sock up, you rass.  Yeah.  Yes.  I just want to say that I think it's your fault that Diana's a bad mother because instead 
[04:09:00]  of going into the supermarket and buying food for my children for their lunch  tomorrow, I'm sitting out here in the parking lot listening to Stunker Patty getting  boom-mockied.  Yeah.  It was a terrific, terrific video.  That was a good bukkake-ing.  All right.  How long till that's up?  This afternoon.  I can't wait to see that.  I want to see that.  I don't want to hear tonight.  Oh, it's not up yet.  You're going to have to sync it up with the radio show so you can hear her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was terrific, though.  Of course.  All right.  Thank you, Lindsay. 
[04:09:30]  I love you, guys.  Give it to me.  Her sexy talk stopped the second and something hit her face.  And boy, what sexy talk that was.  Yeah.  Give it to me.  It's in my nose.  Ow.  Jesus.  Well, I can't breathe.  It's in my ear.  Well, that was a fun day of reading.  Yes.  It certainly was.  What a fun day.  Racist Kramer for tomorrow?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to have to save that for tomorrow.  After 11.  Okay.  Yeah, I got a couple things I actually can't put off. 
[04:10:00]  No.  I'm going to go home and take a nice watery shit.  What do you think of that?  Ooh, that's a good one.  I like.  All right.  We had a good show.  Thanks, Mike.  Gentlemen.  Thanks.  Later.  Thanks, everybody.  Thank you.  And we have to get to Andrea tomorrow with the muffins.  I don't know if she actually brought them.  Oh, is she still here?  Hold on.  Get her in here for it.  Yeah, get her in here for it.  I don't know if she brought them or not.  I asked if somebody.  Food smoothies brought to you by Travis the chef and Brian the GM of Rosen's Restaurant and Caterers.  That's 23 East 51st Street between 5th and Madison.  Really helped out the show today.  If you're in the area, maybe stop by and check out what they're all about. 
[04:10:30]  Rosen's Restaurant between 5th and Madison.  Okay?  All right.  Great.  Hi, Andrea.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Microphone, baby.  Microphone.  You knew the stripper?  No.  Used to be.  Got it?  Oh, yeah?  No, I didn't say.  I didn't say.  He didn't say you are one.  He said you knew the stripper.  You knew the dancer.  Oh, oh, Amelia.  Yeah.  She's in my neighborhood.  Oh, cool.  We go to the same bar.  Yeah.  It's wild.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  For the new listeners, Andrea? 
[04:11:00]  Yes?  She brought us a cake that was just god-walled.  It was the worst cake ever.  Jimmy loves cake, and he just hated this.  Yeah.  And I saw you spit it out.  Yeah, I didn't mean to.  I would never spit out someone's cake in front of them.  You did.  But it was so awful.  My mouth wouldn't allow me to chew it.  So, Andrea was bringing cupcakes the other day, because she had a bigger treat, and what  happened?  You didn't come.  I fell, and I fell on the cupcakes, like on 6th Avenue.  It was really embarrassing.  So, she went home. 
[04:11:30]  She baked cupcakes and then fell on them.  Were you injured on the cupcakes?  No, the cupcakes were injured.  It was really, like, they're, like, rolling on the floor.  Oh, my gosh.  But I brought another one.  Okay.  Can we see it?  Yeah, okay.  Well, it's been in my bag since about, like, 9 o'clock.  Ah, she's already making excuses.  Okay.  Well, it looks funny.  What is that?  That's not a cupcake.  It's not.  It's a cake.  That's a cake?  A cupcake.  That's not a cake.  That's a cookie.  It's fucking...  Holy shit.  That's pizza.  That's loose leaf with pizza cheese on it. 
[04:12:00]  That is pizza.  Wait a minute.  Let me smell it.  Wait a minute.  What the fuck is that?  It's called a cup of flour, a cup of sugar, and a fruit cocktail, and it's good.  It couldn't be good.  Where do you work?  It looks awful.  I swear to you.  People, I can describe this so easily, and you don't even have to use your imagination on  this one.  It looks exactly like a, let's say, twice-sized Sicilian slice of pizza that's been left out 
[04:12:30]  at a party overnight in the box, and you open up the box in the morning and wake up, and  there it is.  That's what it looks like, only a little thinner.  It's not as thick, but it's got that glazed-over, like, oil from the cheese on top of it.  She's fucking nuts.  It looks nothing like cake.  I'm so glad security decided to leave two minutes ago.  That is some kind of...  It looks like, um... 
[04:13:00]  I'm harmless.  It's like a scab.  You brought in a scab cake.  It looks like lunchroom pizza.  Yeah.  It's not.  Left overnight.  Who has been...  It smells awful.  It's disgusting.  Does it?  Smell it.  It doesn't...  We gotta get somebody in here to eat it.  Someone's gotta eat it.  I won't.  Smell it.  It smells weird.  Tinfoil.  It was pretty this morning.  And she brings in the awful plastic bag.  It was pretty this morning.  Pretty.  Yeah.  What the hell is it?  Everyone's just looking, going, oh, no way. 
[04:13:30]  I'm eating that.  Where's Bill?  Yeah, get Bill.  He'll eat it.  He'll eat anything.  We know that.  No, not since we hired him.  He doesn't eat stuff.  Craig and that awful hat might eat it.  Sorry.  Yeah, that's true.  By the way, that sweaty bag.  Could you lift that bag, Andrea?  Look at the fucking bag she brought that cake in.  It looks like something that's used to hold body parts.  It's powdered sugar.  What?  It was powdered sugar?  It was.  Yeah, I'm sure it is.  It's a liquid sugar.  Look at this fucking dirty, awful bag.  Well, you guys didn't fucking tell me where this place was.  I was walking around goddamn 6th Avenue for like five hours. 
[04:14:00]  You'd been here before.  No, but I don't remember you guys.  That bag is worth $1,000 on the street.  She got the wrong bag.  Right now, there's...  That is awful looking.  It's awful.  So now, you've done nothing to improve the look of the cake.  You've actually...  That looks worse than the cake you brought in the first time.  So looks-wise, you've gone down.  I know.  Now, as far as taste, we're going to have to...  Someone's got to taste this fucking thing.  You're going to do it?  All right, Craig. 
[04:14:30]  I tasted it last time.  Crack off a little piece.  Microphone, microphone, microphone.  Yeah, you're a good judge because you...  Wait.  I tasted the last one.  Scout's Honor, you're not trying to poison anyone?  God, no.  I'll eat it first.  No, she's not like that.  Scout's Honor.  She better eat it first.  Boy, you would have tripped up the KGB, Ope.  Scout's Honor, you're not trying to poison me?  All right.  I'll take a bite of it.  It's not bad.  Yeah, it's not bad.  I want to see if you like your own cake, actually.  Yeah, let's...  Okay, it's just really...  It's really what?  Wet?  It's like you dropped it in a puddle.  What the hell do you do for a living?  I'm a singer. 
[04:15:00]  Oh, yeah?  All right, let's see what's on the...  Well, she should be singing, Someone Left a Cake Out in the Rain.  Yeah.  Because that's what it looks like.  What is on the bottom of that?  It's like bouquet-y.  It's all sticky and coated.  What?  It was pretty this morning.  Oh.  Yeah.  What's in it?  What does it taste like?  Oh, my God.  She hates her own cake.  You can't bake.  You said you could bake.  I know.  You suck. 
[04:15:30]  It looks like you baked an abortion.  Oh, my God.  It's out of her mind.  Now, what is in this again?  A cup of flour?  It's flour and sugar and fruit cocktail.  Oh, my God.  And fucking fruit cocktail.  That isn't meant to be in a cake.  That's why it's all wet.  It's fruit cocktail.  That's out of a can, isn't it?  Well, yeah.  And I put fresh pears and peaches in it.  All right.  Why don't you talk about that?  I could absolutely see that happening down at the clinic. 
[04:16:00]  Vacuum.  Forceps.  Suture.  Rolling pin.  Can I have some water?  No, you can't.  Craig.  Oh, my God.  Taster cake.  Now, it's a coffee cake.  She's coughing all over the fucking thing.  It's fruit cocktail and tuberculosis.  All right.  How does it feel?  Describe the consistency.  I really don't know, to tell you the truth.  It's just a slimy bottom. 
[04:16:30]  I would like, actually, what would, I can only imagine, what would Quincy say if that  was maybe a liver out of someone's body?  Sam, this person's been poisoned.  Wow.  Wow.  We got to catch him, Sam.  Jack Pluckman.  Jack Pluckman, everyone.  Fucking T.  Oh, she likes you.  Love that one.  The hand just makes the whole thing.  All right.  So, it's kind of, what?  Oh, it's just, it's like rubber.  It's like wet, it's like wet rubber. 
[04:17:00]  Wet.  Like, you got a square piece of wet rubber about two inches by two inches squared.  Yeah.  And there's fruit in it?  Yeah.  Like fruit cocktail from a canned fruit.  Did you leave the liquid from the fruit cocktail in when you dumped it in the cake mix?  No.  You tried to drain it?  No, I drained it, of course.  Yeah?  Because it's very wet looking.  Well, because it was too dry last time.  Ah, so you overcompensated with a fire hose.  Yeah.  She threw it in the fucking dishwasher for one cycle.  All right, go ahead. 
[04:17:30]  All right.  Yeah, give it a.  Take a bite, Dad.  Give us, tell what you think.  Oh, God.  Let me hear you chew it.  It's pretty moist.  Well, it's better than the last cake.  Oh, it is better.  Okay.  What does it taste like?  Wet rubber.  Wet rubber.  Instead of sand.  And the last one, yeah, it was very dry and sand-like.  Is there a flavor to it?  Yeah.  Are we getting.  Basically, the fruit. 
[04:18:00]  The fruit.  Fruit and rubber.  Is it overwhelming?  Yeah.  Is it cake flavor, like vanilla, chocolate?  Oh, wow.  What just happened there?  Yeah, it's hard to get down.  It's almost like molding itself together.  It refuses to break down.  No, you can chew it all you want.  It's going to remain the same.  It's like eating fucking Terminator 2.  It just forms into your throat shape.  Oh, my shit.  I suck.  I'm sorry.  Wow, you really do.  I do. 
[04:18:30]  Can we cut your hair off?  2,000 cakes?  No.  No, wait.  You got to bite the corner.  There's a.  You actually have a.  How did you burn fruit cakes?  The corner is fucking.  It's burned fruit.  It's like flour.  Oh.  You can see flour.  Get that on camera.  No, it's powdered sugar.  Powdered sugar.  Yeah.  How did you burn something that is like water?  Eat that corner.  It's like you burnt water.  Can we have someone tickle you?  I'm not ticklish.  Yeah, you are.  She just laughs over things that are funny. 
[04:19:00]  Really?  Like her food.  You think she tickles, Jimmy?  You are the worst.  No, I think.  How many men have you lost to your cooking?  I've never really had to cook for anybody.  Craig, could you tickle her?  No.  The second they complain about the fucking food.  With a clean hand.  The pants come down.  All right, lift up your arm.  Hold on.  And they don't care as much.  Lift up your arm so well.  Why are you going to wash his hands with Purell for it?  Craig's going to tickle you.  Uh-oh.  I want to get a little more of that laugh if possible.  Let's see if she's ticklish. 
[04:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a wedgie for people on Pal Talk.  I'm pulling my pants out of my crotch.  Can I get that for you?  Uh, yeah.  All right, here we go.  All right, stand up.  Craig's going to tickle you.  You said you're not ticklish, right?  Someone get a mic on her.  She's fine.  You are really trying to swallow that cake and it's not going down.  He's still chilling.  Jimmy had the perfect fucking example.  That is so funny.  Terminated two cake.  It just molds into your throat. 
[04:20:00]  No.  She is ticklish.  How did you not think it did?  All right, it's a rape now.  Good.  Good.  I think that might have been illegal.  Be a watery cake baker like your father.  Wow.  Wow.  You are ticklish. 
[04:20:30]  I thought you said you weren't ticklish.  Well, I was tickling.  What?  She's never been tickled.  I don't laugh when I'm tickled.  Like, I scream in pain.  Oh.  Right hooks aren't ticklish.  Wow.  You are ticklish.  You went right to the floor.  Oh, God.  Well, this cake, um, better than the last one, but it still sucks ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else can you make?  Or what can you make?  Not what else.  Like, you've been able to make this. 
[04:21:00]  Um, I can make just regular food.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, chicken.  Hey, uh, Jay Moore.  Can you just walk it in?  Hiya, boys.  What's up, Jay?  Jay Moore.  Oh, I missed a cake day in Bukkake.  I can't believe I missed.  I know.  Yeah, just more terrific radio from your pals.  Tampa, Tampa, Patty Bukkake.  Yeah.  Jay, you would have loved it.  I call, I, I gotta tell you guys, when I was in Vegas, I ran into Club Soda Kenny at 
[04:21:30]  the gym at Tears.  Yeah.  And I moved away, and he comes up to me, and he shaved his mustache off, so he just  looked, he looks like an angel fish.  And he says to me, uh.  Hold on.  Oh, he said.  Exactly what he looks like.  Wow, we have been trying for so long to pin it down, and that is him.  He said to me, um, well, that's good, give us a call, and you know, I'm gonna go for  a one-mile jog right now on the, uh, treadmill, and I said, oh, are paleontologists gonna come 
[04:22:00]  and pour cement where your feet were?  Like, watching him on a treadmill, I've never seen anything like it in my life.  Just big and lumbering?  Yeah.  It's like something that should have been extinct.  On my way out of the gym, I said, Kenny, take it easy on the equipment.  Ah, shit.  Well, I had a real, I had a real early, uh, call today, and I called earlier, right before 
[04:22:30]  you guys did the walkover.  Yeah.  And it's like the first time in months where I actually had to, like, be at work at five  in the morning, so I just wanted to say, look, when I'm up, come on, I call, I give  the love to the boys.  Yeah, you do.  We know that.  I understand.  And you're representing on, uh, Ron and Fez, which is nice, they're our boys.  I like every time I call, you call to break my chops.  I got it, you know, they're, uh, Jay.  Yeah, you were getting down on Long Island, I had to, uh, show you, what's what?  We're driving to Vegas, listening to the replay, and, uh, Cox looks over and goes, you know 
[04:23:00]  why Long Island and New Jersey get so mad at each other?  Because they're exactly the fucking same.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone knows it.  Same shit.  What do you think, in the 80s, the fucking chicks in, uh, Jersey didn't have hair stacked  a mile high?  I gotta go with Derek Jennifer Love here with the boobs.  I'll talk to you later.  Oh, you fuck.  Are we ready to go?  Yeah, look at him.  All right, Jay.  All right.  Say hi to him.  Say hi, director.  You're just the director.  Say hi.  What, what is it, a poster in his trailer?  All right, that's our director.  He's a Jew.  What's his name? 
[04:23:30]  It's a him.  What's his name?  Uh, Warner.  His brother owns the Red Sox.  Wow.  Hey, look at that.  You know the Warners.  All right, God bless.  I love you, boys.  Bye.  Bye, Jake.  Bye.  Break a leg.  Say more, everyone.  All right, line of the day.  Here's, uh, today's runner-up line of the day.  I gotta tell you guys, when I was in Vegas, I ran into Club Soda Kenny at the gym at  Cesar's.  Yeah.  And I moved away, and he comes up to me, and he shaved his mustache off, so he looks  like an angelfish. 
[04:24:00]  How?  Wait a minute.  That just happened.  I want to give technician of the day...  No kidding.  Who, that was Danny?  Danny!  Wow.  I'm actually...  I'm actually...  I'm sorry.  I thought that was a mistake.  No.  Somebody fucked up and hit the wrong button.  Line of the day pulled seconds after it happened.  This is getting like, uh, the NFL, with the replays.  That's pretty good.  That's, uh...  We got a second runner-up line of the day for today.  Here it is.  No way.  Your hair is shaped like an Egyptian pharaoh.  King cunt.  How do you like them apples? 
[04:24:30]  No, it ain't.  No, it ain't.  No, it ain't.  That was line of the day.  Her saying, no, it ain't.  Boop.  Oh, wow.  You're still laughing over there.  She doesn't know anything.  What the hell?  She laughs.  Shit.  Line of the day, sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout  against the Russians.  It's all on Bodogfight.com.  You got the martial arts and you got the docu-reality, unlike any scene before.  Whatever. 
[04:25:00]  Here's today's line of the day.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here comes what?  Here comes what?  I don't know.  Light of the day.  Oh, what?  Light of the day.  Oh.  What a boy.  He could sing.  Great voice.  He's got a pipe.  All right, let's see what's on the...  Well, she should be singing Someone Left a Cake Out in the Rain.  Yeah.  Because that's what it looks like.  What is on the bottom of that?  It's like Bukkeki.  Bukkeki got it.  Anthony.  Wow.  There was another Anthony gem today, too. 
[04:25:30]  Thank you.  There was another great one you fired out.  Two, actually.  One at CBS and one here.  Going to have to listen to the replay.  I know you haven't.  Yeah.  I guess.  That's what we like people to do.  All right.  We got to go.  I don't remember what it was, either.  Thanks for the cake.  Do you know what I mean?  No, there was one I really laughed at before.  I felt good about something today.  Yeah.  I think it was.  Do you remember what it was, Kevin?  No.  Oh.  What?  Danikens, what is it?  Because Dan won.  Dan keeps track.  Was it the cowcatcher one?  Oh.  That was it.  The cowcatcher.  That was good.  First, he was one, and then he was cute.  How did it go?  Yeah.  He was one, then he killed, but it was very fun. 
[04:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That should have got some kind of mention, too.  All right.  What, Dan?  I think he's always going to go into politics.  Jimmy's like my lawyer when it comes to a line of the day.  I love it.  I hear the lines, and I know what I reacted to.  Yeah.  That's all.  Yeah.  I don't react to my own lines, and I'll react to yours or Ops.  I mean, I won't react to my own.  I know.  When you say one, it's like, ah, no.  Well, there it is.  When you say something, and you don't react to it, you're just so busy thinking about  getting blown after.  Jimmy, you know, you're wearing your readership at the wrong place.  What do you mean?  You're supposed to wear it down.  You're supposed to wear it down. 
[04:26:30]  On his cock?  No.  Lowers.  But no, this opens me up on the top.  Okay.  I don't know what to do.  I wear it.  Here's why I wear my breather.  I strip.  I wear it lengthwise from the tip of my nose up to my forehead, and I wonder why it doesn't  help.  Scare young children away.  Yeah, I make myself in a piggy face.  Oh, God.  We got to go.  Doug, why are you calling this late? 
[04:27:00]  Hey, no, I was wondering, how would an outer-towner like myself be able to get into the egg  non-competition.  Oh.  You have to come here, Doug.  Yeah, you'd have to.  We would save a position for you if you want in.  I will be there on the 1st.  Can I be an entrant into the competition?  Yeah, you're officially in.  Beautiful.  For all you do for the show, yes.  Yes, you can represent.  All you have to do is bring photos of your wife's hiney, and you're more than welcome  to be a part of this contest.  And now, to make it fair, we got to get one representative, somebody from Whackbag, I  guess. 
[04:27:30]  That's fine.  She'll be with me that day.  Atta boy, Doug.  Here's the one up.  Here's the deal.  Whackbag, get together and try to come up with your best contestant.  All right?  One.  We'll give one guy from Whackbag an open invitation.  Okay?  All right, Doug.  Competition.  Thanks, boys.  You're in, Doug.  Thank you.  All right.  We do that in, what, 11 days?  The eggnog drinking cup.  Yes.  Number three.  You don't like eggnog?  No, the cardiac arrest is gross.  It's funny someone saying something's gross after bringing that in. 
[04:28:00]  I know.  Yeah.  Fucking Sicilian pizza keg.  That was a good call.  Ugh.  Just awful looking at that.  It's kind of like a cake.  It looks like this.  It's kind of like a cake, but it has no cake qualities.  Yeah, no cake-like qualities.  I'm not a cake person.  You've made a non-cake.  I'm not a cake person.  If that saw a cake, the world would disappear.  Don't be smashed a pie.  Now, I can make pies really well.  Then bring a pie.  You make a pie good?  Yeah.  By the way, my favorite part of the-  Well, you said you make great cake. 
[04:28:30]  Don't bring a pie in.  We've got to go home.  Yeah, we're out.  My favorite part of the show was when Jimmy smashed his cock on Stalker Pets.  Oh, did you like that?  I made a great sound.  I just want to acknowledge that.  We're going to have to have that for tomorrow, perhaps, so we can hear that.  I want to hear the peep, peep sound it made.  I only did one slap just to give the kid a break.  Let's just get that sound and play it over at CBS so we can, you know, just play it.  We won't even say what it is.  So we know what it is.  And all the XMers will know what it is and we'll all just kind of chuckle inside all day long.  I was listening yesterday.  Oh, whatever.  And I know what it was. 
[04:29:00]  All right.  How did I put my headphones and my jacket?  You want some Purell for your fingers so you can take them?  Yes, I was going to wash them.  Oh, okay.  Wash them.  No, hit the commercials.  There's a virus spreading in our area.  Will it affect you?  We'll find out on the next Opie and Anthony show.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  I don't really have the virus yet.  I'm kind of itchy and stuff, but I don't really have the virus.  That virus you're always talking about. 
[04:29:30]  The virus, the Opie and Anthony. </pre>
