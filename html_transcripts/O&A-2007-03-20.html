<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened chaotically, with unexplained strong smells and exclamations.  The hosts then immediately transitioned into a heated debate sparked by a newspaper article comparing their show unfavorably to Steve Harvey's.  The article highlighted Harvey's use of gospel music and his self-proclaimed unmatched comedic talent, a claim Opie and Anthony vehemently disputed.  This led to a discussion of a memo from their program director, John Minnelli, criticizing their lack of coverage of a Madison Square Garden basketball brawl.  Opie and Anthony defended their editorial decisions, arguing that Anthony's divorce and other news stories, such as Sean Bell's shooting and Antoine Walker's homophobic remarks, were more relevant to their audience.  They also criticized Richard Johnson, a New York Post gossip columnist, for relying on anonymous sources.  The hosts also discussed Jim Carrey allegedly stealing a bit from David Caruso and showcased a "MacBook Karaoke" segment featuring contestant Ariana.  They promoted their upcoming "Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Comedy Tour" in Las Vegas.  The segment concluded with further mockery of Steve Harvey and a replay of Ariana's karaoke performance.

The next segment began with a discussion about a police shooting, debating the officers' culpability and referencing the Amadou Diallo case. This transitioned into promotion of "The Money Snatch" contest for women on their website, followed by sexually suggestive banter about cookies sent by Kelly from a Dallas affiliate, "Pugs and Kelly."  The discussion then returned to the critical Associated Press article comparing their show to Steve Harvey's, playing clips of Harvey's show which they found underwhelming, particularly highlighting his co-host Shirley Strawberry's frequent "uh-huh" responses. Listener calls followed, with one defending Harvey and another criticizing the hosts' focus on other shows.  The segment also included stereotypical and offensive remarks about German people and Nazism in relation to a Lufthansa plane news story, and concluded with a discussion of a Philadelphia news anchor's apology for using the word "retard," including a caller whose sister with Down syndrome was offended.

The following segment began with listener feedback regarding previous broadcasts, noting only 23 out of 150,000 emails expressed offense.  A callerâ€™s anecdote about a woman with Down syndrome using offensive language was discussed humorously.  The hosts debated movie preferences, praising Don Cheadle and criticizing Adam Sandler, with one host revealing an emotional reaction to "On Golden Pond."  A listener email revealed a "soccer mom" listener. This led to a news story about three men arrested for drug possession after failing to pay a toll, followed by more "MacBook Karaoke,"  with further discussion of Steve Harvey and technical difficulties in the studio, including a late Black Sabbath promotional item.  A caller complained about being "chipped" in the karaoke contest, and the hosts played their performance again. A discussion about a listener with a noticeable erection who "walked over" to the studio then transpired, focusing on the listener's perceived penis size. The hosts then shared anecdotes about their childhood experiences with nudity, witnessing and engaging in sexual acts. The segment concluded with further technical issues, listener calls, off-color jokes, and Ariana's return to sing a Whitney Houston song.

The final segment consisted primarily of sexually explicit and shocking listener call-ins detailing their childhood sexual experiences. Callers recounted witnessing exposed genitals, early sexual relationships, and observing their mothers' bodies in various states of undress.  Other calls detailed witnessing sexual acts, seeing exposed genitalia in public places, and witnessing suggestive behavior.  One caller shared a disturbing story about childhood abuse and the killing of a pet.  The hosts, along with Jimmy, reacted with a mix of shock, amusement, and crude humor.  A poorly received audio clip about a "technosexual" movement was played, met with confusion and disdain. The segment concluded with more sexually explicit calls and further discussions of childhood experiences.  No guests besides the hosts and Jimmy were in studio during this segment.

[00:04:00]  times it's just oh it's not funny he's not he's not in the funny department you can't beat him in the  funny department though i can't he's the minister of the funny department i think i could beat him  anywhere i want a few years ago so now we got to pay attention we got to see uh we got to get some  audio of steve harvey being funny being funny because you can't beat him in the funny department  i want to see what kind of funny he's bringing but like 200 articles like it's in every newspaper in 
[00:04:30]  america this morning yeah and we're all over the article just getting kind of trashed and a bunch of  cheap shots yeah anyway we'll get into that also uh i heard rumors some rumors rumors that someone  was very disappointed around here yesterday yeah talking about uh new york city because you and i  and little jimmy norton didn't talk about the uh the basketball melee at madison square garden the 
[00:05:00]  other night care anthony talked about uh something in his personal life the whole the divorce thing is  rearing its ugly head spent over an hour on that yesterday which made for some very interesting  radio and then i heard some rumors you got to say rumors because if if you're not completely correct  then that causes all sorts of problems behind the scenes rumor has it rumor has it that the pd  john minnelli who just kind of lurks in the shadows we have a pd he just lurks in the shadows we don't  even i think we see him once every two weeks he's like the threat of cancer 
[00:05:30]  but he kind of just lurks in the shadows we're broadcasting from this huge studio in new york  there's a lot of shadows look look that corner is very shadowy yeah you can barely see it could  be in that corner right now we don't know just lurking all of a sudden you'll see him pop out and  he's got a sherlock holmes hat on he just pokes out of a door takes a quick look and leaves  that's all we know from john minnelli just lurks he licks his pencil tip and writes down something 
[00:06:00]  that will be critical right right it moves on to the next room to write something critical  critical just but he just lurks in the shadows he's creepy what'd you say he's like uh that guy  from willie wonka yeah whoever that creep was it popped up every time there was like something  going on with a ticket yeah that was lurking around and looking very suspicious slugworth that's who he  is yeah yeah slugworth shows up in an awful suit like he's everywhere how does he do it he's slugworth  but that's our pd in new york we don't really know him yeah uh rumor has it every once in a while 
[00:06:30]  he'll show up like at 8 50 8 55 and that's about the time we leave here and go to xm satellite radio  but besides that he's just always lurking and his emails are very very lurkish very very just very uh  i don't know he's a nudge yeah a little negative nelly he was so surprised we didn't talk about the  basketball melee in madison square garden maybe steve harvey should have been talking about that 
[00:07:00]  well he he was talking about the other uh high profile case here in new york ah the uh the sean bell  yeah he was doing some hard hitting uh uh he was putting his own little little spin on it  saying uh pretty much that it was racism that caused the cops to do that meanwhile two of the  cops that are indicted are black one's a white guy but it was racism and all this hard hitting  cutting edge stuff he was doing while broadcasting live from disney world oh god was he what a cracker 
[00:07:30]  he is the whitest black guy yeah he really i don't give him much of the street cred thing you know  not really giving him much street cred i don't think a lot of the community looks at him like with any  street cred i think he does well because the black community just uh they just don't have ipods  they have a few stations to listen to we're losing our white audience to the ipod yeah  exactly hey i got the email from uh john minnelli just lurking in the shadows because i want to keep 
[00:08:00]  it fair keep it fair here it is here's a memo by the way these memos never get to us these emails  never get to us nope he decides to beat up our staff instead uh travis and fan i strongly suggest  you guys check for breaking news before the show via or via for example drudge and cable news so  that ona know about more than just what's in the newspapers for example they didn't appear to know 
[00:08:30]  about last night's riot at madison square garden didn't know about it we talked about it in the  office yeah we talked about in the office we talked about in the office of course nothing we could say  on the air now it's true yeah that was kind of a diverse group of uh misbehaviors right see he just  kind of he kind of lurks around and he thinks we just get our info for the radio show by looking at  three papers actually it's five newspapers and then i personally uh check the boston herald the 
[00:09:00]  philadelphia inquired the chicago sun times the washington post the dallas paper the cleveland paper  the advocate i said boston herald boston globe and then i go to drudge report then i go to google  news actually and make sure there's nothing breaking on google news so stop insulting us with these  stupid emails what what we only do a three-hour show anthony's uh personal life with him being  served papers after thinking his divorce is is over he just has to uh write a few more checks and it's 
[00:09:30]  finally done but now he realizes he has to go back to court i've been served he's been served there's a  whole accounting thing that's going to happen that was a little more important in our world than this  stupid freaking basketball melee at madison square garden yeah so don't don't think we just read a  couple papers to get our info for the show my whole life is sitting in front of a computer and looking for  information as is the staffs like when you get home do you just stop i'm i'm online like constantly 
[00:10:00]  and i've checked my emails and then i'll go to like drudge i'll go to uh youtube to see what's going  on new videos like i'm constantly going to fark.com like all the sites that's my life  it's pretty much getting information for the next day i go to dig i go to break i go to youtube i go to  yahoo i go to google yeah this i go to i go to radio websites to see what's going on in in our business 
[00:10:30]  all kinds of tech sites and stuff to see what's the the latest in uh gadgets and gizmos like there's  we're not just coming here an hour before the show and looking through two newspapers and then  hitting the air the whole you know our whole lives are pretty much dedicated to getting material  for these uh hours that we do the the show at whether it's life experience whether it's someone  coming to my door and serving me with court papers or whether it's a sitting up uh uh until nine  o'clock at night trolling websites for material yeah that's what we do so we saw every single 
[00:11:00]  thing that is listed here on his paper we did see some of them we talked about some of them we wanted  to talk about but didn't have time others we just decided not to uh hardaway bashed gays on sat on  sunday night it was on drudge etc but ona didn't mention it that monday why talk about hardaway bashing  gays when we could bash gays all by ourselves absolutely add hardaway people right it's a double header  some of these stories some of these stories are just whatever yeah we're not gonna do much on it 
[00:11:30]  we don't really have an end game and we kind of feel like our audience you know that they're not  listening to us for an all-out news report yeah you know and this is the problem john who i swear  to god he's a pd that just kind of lurks in the shadows he showed up uh and he dressed down and kind  of watched the staff for an hour and then and then came to some ridiculous conclusions like i strongly  suggest you guys check for breaking news before the show uh via for example drudge and cable news 
[00:12:00]  so that ona know about more than just what's in the newspapers that is such an insult i can't even  tell you oh besides all the shows i dvr yeah fox news channel and uh msnbc constantly and the  insider to get uh make sure we're up uh up to date on entertainment news for example they didn't appear  to know about last night's riot at msg it goes on also they discussed jim carrey's ripoff three days  after he'd been on leno i know because i saw that show uh jim carrey ripping off the david caruso bit 
[00:12:30]  uh jim carrey being the last person to do the david caruso bit we finally decided to bring it to  everyone's attention because it made sense at the time when we uh brought it up but it wasn't like  oh my god jim carrey's ripping off david caruso gotta start tomorrow tomorrow's show talking about  that it just came up in natural conversation we finally got to it also hardaway bashed gays on a  sunday night it was on drudge but ona didn't mention it that monday man man honestly we didn't  have much on it no and i and we did mention it we did mention that hardaway was uh was beating up on 
[00:13:00]  the gay uh the more ona talk about breaking type news the more people will be inclined to tune to  them when they hear of something happening plus it makes the show seem more like a mandatory listen  than an optional one frankly it sounded odd for them to be apparently oblivious to the msg action this  morning i heard about it by uh tuning to winds during one of ona's breaks so did i i heard about  it on winds driving in i i i completely knew about it i just didn't see you know we were kind of busy 
[00:13:30]  we would have talked about it yesterday but we kind of got uh sidetracked here's the other material  here's only three hours here's the problem john minnelli uh he he uh he's the pdf free fm here in new  york city in his world we were just discussing this in in the office everyone has their own agenda  john minnelli's agenda he wants a uh uh uh uh uh uh talk shows for this radio station that is all  about new york city yeah unfortunately not unfortunately for us but unfortunately for you 
[00:14:00]  we have a massive audience that goes way past new york city way past we just said hi to canada we  wake up canada every morning as well how stupid is that you know we're on uh 25 regular radio stations  we're on xm satellite radio that goes coast to coast and all over canada and guess what we have  to make some decisions and uh to our audience the msg basketball melee sorry in our world isn't as big  as it would be in john minnelli's world it really isn't yeah i mean it was a story we we would have 
[00:14:30]  hit on it it's just we got other things my only thing is what he says travis and than i strongly  suggest you guys check like it was their fault i mean they are bothering idiots wrongly but that  was on the prep sheet we just didn't talk about it but it was there oh yeah and they did their job  oh man travis i'll tell you right now i'll speak for travis he is pissed off at this memo he's like  oh my goodness these guys are well prepared and they and they uh put all this stuff in front of us 
[00:15:00]  and then we decide sorry but in our world anthony talking about his divorce something that's been a  storyline on this show for many many years is so much more important to our audience than talking  about the the facts and the msg basketball melee basically they were playing what a championship game  and all hell broke uh broke loose there was gunfire outside madison square garden they arrested 21  people uh and they confiscated like almost 80 knives there you go what all right so we said that now  now what now what we can we could talk about uh you know who is involved the elephant in the room 
[00:15:30]  you mean the elephant in the room as to the perpetrators seriously now what now what happens  they have banned night basketball games at uh what madison square garden in the city in general  something like that no one talking about why though why they're banning it how about you bring up the  like like you know the the reason why is there a problem getting uh members of the black community 
[00:16:00]  together in a large venue and having it come off peaceably i i don't understand it you want us to  talk about okay we'll talk about a little bit like reverend al is all over this uh cops being indicted  this story the sean bell story uh i'd love to see reverend al come out one day against something  like what happened at the garden it was not a melee it was a riot there were cops in riot gear  running all over the city trying to keep order on horseback in their actual riot gear uh why why why 
[00:16:30]  did the uh media portray it as a melee it was a riot why didn't he address the old lady being punched in  the face at 101 years old like he would have if the perpetrator was a white guy with a crew cut  and she was 101 year old on her way to bible stop yeah that's why no one's taking reverend al seriously  and and he just latches on to whatever victims whatever black victims there are like this family  of sean bell he is now a fixture in their family he's probably got a cot set up in the house 
[00:17:00]  set me up a cot he's never seen without them now and he's always uh mouthing off and meanwhile two of  the cops that are indicted are black and uh one is white and and he's treating this as some kind of big  racist thing instead of uh cops that were putting a bad situation maybe some bad information uh maybe  they did jump the gun uh on a jump the gun maybe they did uh you know uh get scared whatever happened 
[00:17:30]  i sincerely doubt it was hey let's kill some black people you know but reverend al is all over this  one but when it comes to you know uh uh the black community looking uh and coming off very badly  like this madison square garden thing how about someone in the in the community uh getting in  front of a microphone and saying look these are the instances that make other people look down on black 
[00:18:00]  people this is what is making people go oh god damn what look at this that all this figures  it's big you can what why can't why can't a group just get together watch a goddamn basketball game  without stabbings and shootings unbelievable but no one wants to like try to address that problem so  just ban it so no one can do it because everyone's a problem so ban it right now ban that instead of  addressing the actual problem which is some people can't just sit there and watch a friggin basketball game 
[00:18:30]  uh without starting a riot address that go to a white sport like hockey where at least the participants  have the dignity to be the barbarians and hitting exactly well it depends like the old gladiator days  now you're moving into my expertise it depends who's playing because uh when the rangers and  islanders go at it islanders go at it it's a little uh it's a little different in the states  yeah but it's not an all-out uh you're not getting a brawl you're getting a couple of guys fighting 
[00:19:00]  security tech takes them out because in general i guess when whitey fights it's not all jump in  no it's like other people get away isn't they'll get away they'll go oh there's a fight over there  i mean if your friend's in a fight then you jump in a little bit but but the per the peripheral  people they're just watching and having a good time and then the crowd doesn't move from place to  place continuing the rioting absolutely at least not in in in this country i mean soccer all right  good point yeah soccer hooligans england they were moving toward time square hundreds of cops had to 
[00:19:30]  stop the riot yeah well i don't know why we're talking about this now because now it's a day late  it's a day late i a fan hey was that john i thought i saw something moving what was that who's there  who's there the shadow seemed to turn into smoke and disappear in one of the vents  who's there just a black cloud floating through the studio quickly i thought i saw a sherlock holmes hat  licking the pencil and i thought i heard the sounds of 
[00:20:00]  he's the tricky one is anyone there  all right oh just study those shadows will you there uh fan all right so there you go there's uh  the break we should have done yesterday yeah everyone is wiser now because of it yeah there you go  oh god one of these days i would love to see one of these dopey pds do their own radio show 
[00:20:30]  that'd be fun because they just know how to do one and then we'll we'll stand there and write things  in a little notepad yeah send off memos uh macbook karaoke today round two we found a gem yesterday i  believe she's coming in uh and we didn't give her the macbook i i didn't sleep well last night i gotta  tell you well it was it was a very tough decision decision sometimes uh these things aren't as obvious 
[00:21:00]  as they should be um it was tough but i had to go for the girl that actually sang to protect the  credibility of the contest opie to protect it i would have liked to have voted for this girl here  but we we must protect the sanctity of the karaoke contest if you only give it to the goofy people  then people are going to try too hard to be goofy and once they do that it's over because then it's 
[00:21:30]  just a thousand people sending in what they think we want to hear instead of honest can't sing goofy  audio it's going to be people going watch i'm going to make this sound really goofy well we're smart  we could figure that stuff out yeah but for them to have to troll through it and then you get no  good ones all right it's no balance this gave it balance uh well it's ariana from new york by the  way when we get back we got to talk about the big plane we'll talk about the big plane big plane

[00:30:30]  a fun little sound  that is played  when um  when people are lurking  ah  yeah  people are lurking  well this richard johnson  is another one  that just lurks  in the shadows  excuse me  york can i get a miracle  yeah york one more miracle  miracle  he's throwing his hands  in the air  he's so white  like he just don't care  why don't you just die  i said can i get a miracle 
[00:31:00]  huh  miracle  miracle  it's like telling a retard  to do something  we're gonna have to do a little  better than this guy  and they just mimic it  to beat steve harvey  in the funny department  i'm gonna have to do  a little better than this  yeah  anyway so uh  richard johnson  and he's another one  of these guys  that just lurks  in the shadows  and he  that's lurking  in the shadows  he's tiptoeing  from shadow  to shadow  where  who the  what  huh  it's gone 
[00:31:30]  he's like those guys  yeah  i was talking about  once playing video games  yeah  and um  when when you have to be  stealthy  and you're in the shadows  and you kind of come out  in the light for a second  but then hit another shadow  and one of the guards goes  hey what was that  yeah  i saw something  yeah  and then you sit there  for two seconds  in the shadow  must have been the wind  and they just walk away  hey you there  stop  huh  my mind must be  playing tricks on me 
[00:32:00]  and they walk away  yeah  great  well we got  john in one of these  shadows somewhere  just writing down  comments  i saw something move  but now it's gone  wait a minute  it's lurking  did he go from that corner  to that corner  i don't know  i barely saw anything  maybe we should turn the lights on  in here  make it a little brighter  uh anyway  so uh  richard johnson's another one of these guys  he just lurks in the shadows  and he just  he has a pad and pencil  what else does he have jimmy 
[00:32:30]  you've described him perfectly  uh  about a month  hopefully aids  a bottle of jack  um  and uh  probably penny loafers  and some kind of  some type of androgynous slacks  he's trying to fit in  slacks  basically he goes to all the clubs  in new york  and all the big events  but he's lurking in the shadows  with a  with a notepad  and a pencil  he's ratting people out  or maybe he has one of those  like micro recorders  yeah  in the corner  right now  i'm seeing some canoodling 
[00:33:00]  i'm gonna make my way  over to the bathroom  i'm by the bathroom  wow  so uh  whoa whoa whoa  this is uh  cause i remember ralph  uh  this is uh  richard johnson  put this  about the  the chick who banged ralph  finds in the uh  quantus  they like to call him rafe  is it rafe  even though it's spelled ralph  i like to say ralph myself  ralph  i pardon you  but they  they're just 
[00:33:30]  they're a little too pompous  all right  well ralph  ralph phineas  phineas j whoopey  said this girl was uh  the stewardess apparently  was a two thousand dollar  a night escort  in australia years ago  oh  that's the one who gave him  the quick uh  bang in the uh  bathroom  that's how beautiful  that was kind of  a high-rex horse  how fantastic would that be  oh you're platinum  well read further  she told the paper  her trick uh  tricks turning  was linked to a long  battle with depression  stemming from her years  as an undercover cop 
[00:34:00]  whoa  what  oh  and she worked at a brothel  i couldn't pay the rent  and i was too proud  to ask anyone for money  anyway  so at least he's brave  enough to mention that story  but that was in a  that was an actual interview  too proud to ask  for money  but she'll  do anything  for a buck  a cop  a stewardess  and a hooker  could she pick  higher-risk jobs  almighty  what a type  a personality  she's now driving 
[00:34:30]  gasoline trucks  over mountain ranges  in afghanistan  let's add to it  or iraq  whatever  let's see the one  anyway uh  richard johnson  uh  just hiding in the shadows  this column bothers me  so  so much  because it just shows you  how what  what type of person he is  he's just a pussy  yeah  he's just a poo  ah  it's the just asking column  just asking  where he has all this info  but he's not brave enough  to mention names 
[00:35:00]  because he doesn't want  to get sued  yeah  but his whole column  is rumor  for the most part  uh  it says just asking  which socialite  was conspicuously absent  from the front row  during fashion week  because she was in rehab  hmm  he knows  so why don't you  print the name  someone told you  of of this person  not being at fashion week  she's probably there  every year  she wasn't  because she's in rehab  mention it  if they're in rehab  then you got nothing  to worry about  the bride-to-be  went to a special spa  to conquer her cocaine  habit before the wedding 
[00:35:30]  is there an empty seat  in the front row  I'm back  let me let me  yeah  there you go  that's an empty seat  right  he goes to the fashion show  fashion week  and he sits in the back row  probably with binoculars  looking who's in the front row  oh my god  there's an empty seat  in the front row  someone's conspicuously missing  who usually sits there  and then he like  asks a few questions  and then next thing you know  jot jot jot  jot  I bet he can't even talk  out of the front of his mouth 
[00:36:00]  like I bet even in casual conversation  he probably has to say like this  out of the front of your mouth  like look straight ahead  and just talk down to the left  he can only talk that way  oh  excuse me bartender  can I have a drink  what  can I have a drink  keep it on the QT  did you hear about  Bruce Willis  did you hear about  Bruce Willis  did you hear about  Bruce Willis  who he's having sex with  you hear who  Lindsay Lohan's  batter  Lindsay Lohan  was in rehab  but now she's out drinking  look  let's go to the bar  there she is 
[00:36:30]  now downing  banana daiquiri  oh no  she's moving  to the dance floor  let's follow her  hold it  hold it  I think she's on to us  move away  what a creep  he's got different disguises  like he wears different outfits  but they're real bad  awful  and every one of them  he has that stupid  gumshoe hat  I think what bothers me  about this  and I think a lot of people  out there can relate  it's that supervisor  that's lurking in the shadows 
[00:37:00]  at your own  effing office  yeah  getting you in trouble  little  walking through  just  lurking around  tries to look like  he's just walking through  but he turns his head  and kind of looks  at what everyone's doing  he's trained to listen in  on every conversation  as he walks  you know  past the cubicles  taking mental notes  alright  that person's not doing anything  yeah  I'm gonna  need you to  go ahead  and come in  on Saturday  by the way 
[00:37:30]  moving on  so then  Richard Johnson  also says  which celebrity mom  joins her daughter  in snorting lines  of cocaine  hmm  which is it  does he say  of course not  because he doesn't have  the balls to say it  celebrity daughter  joins her mom  do you think it would be  Lindsay Lohan  I think it would be  Lindsay Lohan  personally  I'm gonna have to go  I think  personally  I don't have  any information  I'm just speculating 
[00:38:00]  here  she and her mom  could be great people  but I would speculate  oh boy  hey Opie  he's sometimes  called  Rafe Fiennes  not Rafe Fiennes  I would bet money  on that one today  Rafe Fiennes  Rafe  yes  the German  pronunciation  Rafe  pronunciation  I don't know  but I think it's Rafe  which soulful singer  is bulimic  friends are concerned  the stress of having  a new album  is causing her  to throw up  her meals  name names 
[00:38:30]  who's getting hotter  I'll guess Whitney  wouldn't you used to  yeah but she  she's already a rail  I love the fact  her life's a train wreck  I know  she was America's  like black sweetheart  biggest singer  in the world  at one point  now she's just  this vomiting mess  and finally  which funny man  is having an affair  his wife doesn't mind  she's got her money  and her status  to keep her company  could it be  Steve Harvey  he brings the funny 
[00:39:00]  in the funny department  which funny man  but the point is  he's like  every effing supervisor  out there  you know the funny man  yes  Joel Steinberg  but that just bothers me  it's in the  it's in the post  like weekly  he's just lurking  with his little notepad  and he's got his little  spies all over  New York City  but he doesn't have  the balls to name names  which hockey player  is dating  Dakota Fanning  all those hockey players 
[00:39:30]  seem to luck out  let's go to Chicago  Andy listening on WCKG  Andy what's up  morning fellas  how's it going  alright Andy  hi fella  I just wanted to talk  Steve Harvey  what's he done  as far as  anything besides  soil in the  comedic minor leagues  on BET  and the WB  sorry I gotta  jump in there  and see  I wouldn't say  comedic minor leagues  he was on one of the  biggest comedy tours  in history  yeah he was on  that stupid  kings of comedy  when you watch 
[00:40:00]  that  when you watch  kings of comedy  to me  he was the odd man out  it was like  who is he to be  bringing those  three guys out  from what I heard  what's up there  to do is self promote  from what I heard  alright  since you're obviously  the guy  you go right ahead  I didn't mean to interrupt  what do I know  go ahead  go sorry  my fault  no no it's all about you  pal you're just getting  speculated from Chicago  all of a sudden  you're like a babbling ass  listening to you  I heard he used to  headline the  kings of comedy festival  but he had trouble  following Bernie Mac  and all those guys  that's all well and good  I asked the people out there 
[00:40:30]  name one Steve Harvey joke  he says he's  you can't beat him  in the department of funny  what does he do  we know comedians  I don't know his jokes  nope  and don't say  it's a white thing  because we know  a lot of black comedians  as well  yeah Patrice  and Patrice  and then there's  Patrice  and then there's  whatever his name is  O'Neill  and then Keith Robinson  Keith  Keith Robinson  and the one with  the big huge  you know what  what

[00:46:30]  With their own  Picture your grandma naked scenario  But we're looking for a clever  Yeah  Clever is welcome  Beat's just disgusting  Yeah, absolutely  But this is what the boys came up with  The Opie and Anthony show  Would like to take a moment  To allow our listeners  To imagine their grandmothers  Naked  I'm fine  Walking between the bits  All right  All clean  Hello, Nigel 
[00:47:00]  I didn't know you were home  From prep school  Holy Jesus Christ  God, that sucked  Wow, that really is not necessary  Opie and Anthony  Laughing at your repressed memories  Every morning  Who f*** gets off on this?  Keep the cracks, please  I didn't know we were broadcasting  To Buckingham Palace  Unbelievable  And is that young Sam 
[00:47:30]  Playing the naked grandma?  What is wrong with you guys?  What the hell happens after we go home?  Would they just watch a Monty Python episode  And decide to do a  All right  Well, it's got to start somewhere  Yeah  Is this bad to picture?  Picture like  Picture your  Your dad walking into  Your parents' bedroom  And your mom  Your dad has come home early  And your mom is there on her back  And she's being railed  By a much younger black gentleman 
[00:48:00]  And your father sees it  And stops and goes  Oh  And a little tear  Goes to his face  And he turns around  And walks out humiliated  And then they have to like  Act as if nothing happened  When you get home  You have to  Well, mommy had to pay  For the cracks somehow  That's horrible  Hey, we got the MSG fight update  Ooh  Ooh, an update  This will make John and Elliot  Very happy  But now that the sun is coming up  I know he's not in the studio  Now back to the coffin 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, because we can see  Into all these shadowy corners now  Yeah  Now he's just watching us  On closed circuit television  I'm thinking he's got  Yeah, some Mission Impossible  Scenario  Happened right now  Cameras everywhere  I'm thinking  Or he might be on  One of these building tops  With a telescope  Binoculars  I noticed that he didn't show prep  Between the hours of 6.50  And 7 o'clock a.m.  He watches on closed circuit  Like Mobutu  When he was watching  The Ali Foreman fight  He's afraid of assassination  So he just sits in his office 
[00:49:00]  Creepy little dictator in the head  Yeah  Hmm, where?  Sneak over here  I'll watch them through  Hello, they're on the move  They're on  Wait  I'm alone  Who am I talking to?  No one  I'll just look at them  Through these binoculars  What are they doing?  They don't seem to be going  Through any newspapers  Or drudge  All right  Thand  And Travis 
[00:49:30]  Why aren't the guys  Looking at websites?  Perhaps the internet's down  I'll check it out  It looked like  They were just having fun  As the commercials were playing  Just talking  That time better spent prepping  It's your job  To prep for them  Hmm  Let me scribble this  In my little pad  See this is an ongoing theme today  See you gotta wake up 
[00:50:00]  A little earlier  But basically  RPD is one of these lurkers  He just kinda lurks  In the shadows  Yeah  We don't really see him  But he  Don't see him much  But he writes a lot of  A lot of  Emails  We get memos  That really piss off  A lot of people around here  Emails  As far as our staff  From his scratchings  From his scratchings  In his notepad  All right  But he lives among the shadows  He's  Constantly just lurking  Where we can  Can't really see him  I bet he's gonna end up 
[00:50:30]  In naked girl  Apartment soon  And then we'll get a look at him  That's a good  That's a good vantage point  To keep an eye on this  All right  Here we go  The MSG  Melee  High school  Basketball  Finals  Thing  Huge riot  Hundreds of cops  21 arrests  80 knives  Yeah  Riot police  Riot police  Officials speaking out  About an out of control  High school basketball tournament  On Sunday  A melee broke out  At the garden  Cops arrested  21 people 
[00:51:00]  All under  21 years of age  And now  Garden officials say  Given the security concerns  They may refuse to host  The prestigious high school tournament  In the future  In the meantime  School officials say  They're making changes  In next year's schedule  It will make all games  Day games  In hopes that fans  Will be less prone  To violence  Why  When the night  What happens at night  When the moon comes up  You howl at it  Ow  What the hell is going on  Ow  I got no love for the garden 
[00:51:30]  Anyway  They deserve it  To get overpriced douchebags  They fought a Yankee stadium  Being put in the city  Because it would interfere  With what they wanted  It just creeps  You know  Someone pointed out  I think it was on the  Insta V-back  They basically just said  Wow  Can't wait for the Nets  To move to Brooklyn  Yeah  The Brooklyn Nets  Starting in what  Another year or so  A couple seasons from now  The Nets are going to be  The Brooklyn Nets  Oh my god  Hope they're  Oh my god  Hope they're making  That area nice  Because I don't know 
[00:52:00]  About traveling  Into Brooklyn  Alright  So that's your update  There  Whatever  I don't know  You make a good point  What's the difference  Night day  What's the difference  Yeah what's the difference  What changes  Inside  You don't know  What the hell time it is  True  It doesn't matter  A bunch of jackass  Besides the games  Would be so much  Poorly attended  Because half of the people  That went  Would probably be  In after school  You know  Chess programs  And in the student band  That's true  Intramurals  Doing extracurricular activities 
[00:52:30]  There's the word  Alright and then  Another story we mentioned  A little earlier  Sharpton  You weren't happy  Because Sharpton  Is speaking out  About the Sean Bell  Case  Yeah he latches on  Every time there's  Victim  Black family  Reverend Al  Will be right there  One of the cops  In the incident  Was black right  Well the two  Two of the three  That are indicted  Are black  Right  One is white  But they live  In the white world  Is that what it is 
[00:53:00]  I think that's how  Sharpton  Just because they're  Cops  Yeah  But he was at  His bachelor party  The Sean Bell  He was unarmed  But there was an incident  And unfortunately  He died  And there were  50 shots fired  Yeah  And now Reverend Al  Is continuing the fight  He's outraged  He's latched on  Again  This leech  Has latched on  To another family  To put himself  In the press  No other reason  This guy doesn't care  About anybody  But Al Sharpton  Because if he did  If he really cared  About his community 
[00:53:30]  He would point out  Things like the  Basketball riot  And perhaps try to  Guide some of these  People use his  Power and his  So-called wisdom  And try to guide  Some of these people  And be a real leader  And not just point out  When white people  Or people  That have authority  Like police officers  Are in the wrong  But when your own people  That you're supposed  To be the leader  A leader of 
[00:54:00]  Are doing wrong  And say  Look  This is why  Young black males  Are getting this bad stigma  It's because of events  Like this  But he'll never do that  He'll just latch onto  A family that's been  Victimized  In some way  Shape or form  And just self-promote  Himself  That's  Awful  That was some  Fine commentary  And now it would be  Perfect just to play  The short  I certainly would  But what's happening  Matt points out 
[00:54:30]  The obvious  So we gotta move back  To the MSG melee  Yeah  Listen to this  Matt in New York  Go ahead  Morning gentlemen  Hey Matt  I have two tickets  For the Rangers  And I find it funny  That you know  You can't bring  Obviously you can bring  In a gun  A knife  To a game  But they yell at you  If you bring in  A bag of peanuts  Yeah you try to bring  In a bag of peanuts  Dude I've been stopped  You try to bring  Your own food  Into a sporting event  And they basically  You know get the riot police  To patch it down  Drop the sandwich 
[00:55:00]  Drop it  And take your snacks away  But they've confiscated  Close to 80 knives  I'm just gonna pour  The soda into the gun now  Just bring it in like  And check it out  Yeah  Great observation  And you're so right  So right  Have a good day guys  Alright  I bring my own snacks  And crap into these  Sporting events  Because I don't like  Eating half the stuff  They offer  Yeah  But they wanna make  Every dollar out of you  So they're patting you down  And making sure  You're not sneaking  A juice box in  Perish the thought  You can put out an eye  With that straw 
[00:55:30]  They don't care about the knives  Because they don't make money  Off the knives  They don't sell knives  I don't think  If they were selling knives  Then they would have to  Take your knives away  Great  A knife stand  I'll take that one  Anyway  So now  Make believe  That part of the show  Was a little earlier  Now let's go back  To Anthony  And that brilliant  Brilliant commentary  And now here's  The Reverend Al Clip  As he reacted  To the indictments  Reverend Sharpton  Had a slip up  That got quite a reaction  From the crowd  Clearly  In our judgment  All five officers 
[00:56:00]  Should have been shot  Should have been charged  Let me be clear  All five officers shot  All five officers shot  We do not endorse  They're being shot  Mr. Sharpton went on  To explain his belief  That all five officers  Were acting together  The night of the shooting  So they all should  Have been charged  Did Reverend Al sit in  On the grand jury  Did he sit in  And find out all the facts 
[00:56:30]  As to why  Three of the five  Were indicted  And two weren't  Did he  I don't know  I don't think so  But he knows better  All five should have  Been indicted  Let's talk to  John in Queens  John  Hey what's up guys  What's up John  Listen I totally agree  With you that  Al Sharpton  You know he  He's always  You know he's  Grandstanding  And from the  Tawana Braley case  And I know  All you white guys  You know you hate  Al Sharpton  For the stuff he's done  But sometimes 
[00:57:00]  You know even  You need a little  Bit of evil  You need him  To kind of rally  Around the community  And what happened  To Sean Bell  Was wrong  I live in Jamaica  Queens  And you know  Anytime a guy  Gets shot 50 times  They said he had  Somebody had a gun  Nobody had a gun  In the car  And I mean  There was no reason  To shoot it  To shoot it in their car  50 times  I understand that  You know what happened  It was obviously  An error on the part  Of the police  When they saw  Their fellow officers  Shooting 
[00:57:30]  And they started shooting  The original officers  That were shooting  Thought that their own  Cops were returning  Fire  They thought they  Were bad guys  So it was  Confusion  Things went wrong  Mistakes were made  And unfortunately  An innocent guy died  But does that make it  The police  Does that make them racist  And that they set out  To kill people that night  Do you honestly think  A cop is going to say  You know  Screw my family  My career  I'm just going to 
[00:58:00]  Shoot me some black  People tonight  Even though I'm black  I'm just going to  Shoot some black people  That's the type of  Environment Al Sharpton  Is putting out there  I will give you that  But I tell you what  I'm not scared of  A white or black  I'm just scared of  A cop in general  Sometimes  I don't play around  Why do you think  That is John  Why do you think  You have to walk around  Afraid of the police  Well because  Black people commit  Most of the crimes  In this neighborhood  Yeah  So the cops  Listen I mean 
[00:58:30]  It is what it is  The cops are out to  To protect us  Most of the time  They do a great job  But there's always  Bad apples  The same way  In black people  White people  Some black people  There's always  Some bad apples  I'm scared of  A black guy in the street  More than I'm scared  Of a white guy in the street  Yeah  That's what it is  Well black on black crime  Is a lot more than  White on black crime  That's for sure  Damn right  So I mean  With Charlton still  We don't have any leaders  All we got is  This big fat guy  With a perm  You know  That's all we got  Yeah the black community  Really needs leaders  That aren't so centered 
[00:59:00]  On themselves  And really care  About their people  Al Sharpton  Has no credibility  As far as that  Tawana Brawley thing goes  That still has legs  With me  The guy is a lying sack  He aligned himself  With two disbarred lawyers  And had a farce  Of this Tawana Brawley case  Which tried to  Get an innocent man  Put away  Yeah that's all we got  That's all you got  Why  Again I gotta ask 
[00:59:30]  Why  Where  Where is a leader  That can come forward  That isn't called  An Uncle Tom  Obama  Because  Well Obama's being called  Come on  Even Reverend Al  Is saying Obama's a puppet  Obama  He's saying that Obama  Is the white man's version  Of what a black man  Is supposed to be  So he's bashing him  Why  Because the guy is  You know  Living his life  He's assimilated  To a society  He's not  Running around  With knives 
[01:00:00]  What's wrong  You know  The guy actually  Has a career  In politics  Based on  Not based on  Being a black guy  But just being  An American  Yeah  Yeah absolutely right  That's the problem  In the black community  We don't have any leaders  So all we have  Is shopping  So I mean  In this case  You know  We need somebody  To speak for us  It's the wrong guy  But it is what it is  You know  And so  Then we have this thing  At the garden  And we all look like  Savages again  And you know  It's what it is 
[01:00:30]  I watch the news  And I cringe  Because I'm like  A black guy  And I say  Oh crap  As soon as I hear  Violet said  Madison Square Garden  I swear to God  I hope it's a hockey game  And it's white people  Yeah  Because you know  No brothers are at the hockey game  Yeah  It's all white people  Beating each other up  Throwing batteries  At Santa Claus  Or whatever the hell  They did that day  In Philly  Hey  Well that was  I don't know  A football game  Hey John  Why not listen  To Steve Harvey  Steve Harvey  I can't listen 
[01:01:00]  To that country  Listen  I'm from the dog  I'm listening to you guys  I'm listening to you guys  To WNW  That's what I listen to  Steve Harvey  Get out of here  Alright  Thank you  Thank you my brother  Love you guys  Thanks John  Hey Steve  And poor Jeff  Ex-Cop  Bell is not innocent  Steve go ahead  Good morning  How are you  Alright  And one thing  I respect you guys  Opinions  We all love you  But the one thing  That I get sick of hearing  Is an innocent man  Died that night  He twice  Drove his car 
[01:01:30]  At the police officers  That night  And I hear  I hear more of the fact  That he's getting married  The next day  You know what  I'll  I'll  You're right  But I'll even give him  The benefit of the doubt  And say  That you know  Mistakes were made there too  Because if you're getting  Shot at  I don't think I'm going  To sit there  And especially  If I don't know  They're cops  And I start  You know  The windshield of my car  Is being shot out  I'm probably going to  Step on the gas myself  It was a whole  Cavalcade of mistakes  Made that night  But I really don't think 
[01:02:00]  Anybody was out  That evening  Looking to kill somebody  I don't think  The officers  Were you know  Conspiring inside  Looking at this guy  Going  Let's go out  And F this guy up  Let's shoot him  And you know  Ruin our careers  You know  It was an arrest  That went horribly wrong  I'm sure  Police protocol  Was broken  With the way  They handled the situation  Let me tell you  One thing too  Stuff that I've read too  What I've heard  Is the first shot 
[01:02:30]  Wasn't fired  Until after  He had thrown it  Back in reverse  Until after  The second attempt  To hit the cop  And the thing is  And you hear it  Oh they didn't  Identify themselves  These were rookies  That were out of the academy  For a while  One guy had 700 arrests  These guys are all detectives  They're seasoned veterans  They've done it a million times  And I tell you  The first thing you learn  In the academy  Is police don't move  They tell you right away  Identify yourself  Because the most dangerous thing  That a black man  A black cop can do  In that situation  Is not identify himself  Because that's an all black neighborhood  If he gets up on the car 
[01:03:00]  And just throws a gun  And says  You know  Show me your hands  Motherfuck  Excuse me  And that's  Instead of saying  You know  Instead of saying  Police don't move  Of course  They're going to think  They're getting jacked  By another black guy  Right right  If he has a shield  Around his neck  And he yells  Police don't move  They know the deal right away  And these guys  I guarantee they said  And these guys  Were not innocent guys  These guys were perps  You hear  What was the one kid  Guzman that got shot  Yeah  I've heard numerous times  Oh he was a good kid  He hadn't gotten in trouble  In two years  You know  He was in prison for two years  Yeah they got  That's why he was in trouble 
[01:03:30]  Yeah they got rap sheets  But I mean  You know  Just to look at it  Look at the big picture here  You know  Whatever they did before  Whatever  But I see it as  You know  A night of a lot of mistakes  And I don't  You know  Obviously the family  Is going to be annoyed  If it happened to my family  I'd be out for blood too  Because it becomes personal  But when you look at it  And take the personal angle  Out of it  It's a bunch of mistakes  That were made  That you know  Obviously things have to be 
[01:04:00]  Looked at  And changed maybe  But I don't see  How these guys  Should lose their careers  And their freedom  Over this  I don't know  I don't think  They should go to jail  But I don't think  They should go to jail  I think  Who was the guy  With the unarmed guy  Diallo  Yeah  But you have to be fired  I mean look  We're all accountable  In our jobs  And when you screw up  Monumentally like that  You got to be fired  I don't think it's a criminal thing  Like you set out  To commit a crime  But like you know  Society trusts you  To a certain degree  If you fire one shot 
[01:04:30]  But when someone fires  Thirty shots at somebody  Who's not armed  I don't care what's going on  Unless the guy's  Pointing a fake gun at you  You got to be fired  I don't think  You should go to jail  That's a lot of semantics  Jimmy I love you the best  But that's a lot of semantics  And no disrespect to you  But unless you're a police officer  You can't say  The thing is  I think the detective  Union had  Said it the best  They stopped firing  When they thought  The threat was done  Here's my question  If this cop thought  More bullets were coming at him  Because his partner  Was firing from the back  Of the car  And you think  You're still being shot at 
[01:05:00]  I'm going to pull out  Another magazine  Throw it in  And start firing back  I understand that  But when is the last time  I mean cops are people  When's the last time  Cops just went  Yeah you know what  That was a major screw up  He's got to be fired  Well Volpe  I mean he was convicted  Yeah Volpe  No but I'm saying  Volpe  It's almost like  You don't have to go  To that extreme  To find somebody  Who screws up  Under a high stress situation  Well Jimmy  That guy Kenny Boss  One of the guys  Who was involved  In the Diablo thing 
[01:05:30]  He was found  He was found  Innocent of all  Terminal charges  He had a department trial  He got suspended  He went to Iraq  He served over there  As a soldier  And he still can't  Get his gun and shield  Yeah he wants to come back  He has a shield  But the thing with the shots  Is that's a lot of  Like I said I respect you  But you can't say  That this amount of shots  Is okay  Like 14 is okay  But 15 is too much  They're cops  And unless you're  In that situation  And you know  What's going on  You can't say that  I understand that  But that's like saying  That as a civilian  We have no right 
[01:06:00]  To make any judgment  On police behaviors  Or activities  Of course I don't know  What it's like to be a cop  And 95% of the time  I'm pro cop  And I'm not saying  They should go to jail  But there has to be  A certain amount  Of accountability  Because we trust you  With a gun  And there has to be  A certain amount  Of accountability  And there are times  Where they do screw up  It happens  It's like being in the military  I mean there's times  Where there's high stress  Military situations  And they overdo it  And you know what  They're held accountable  You have to be  Oh they are held accountable  Following this trial  I mean I don't think  These guys are going  To get convicted  But after a 
[01:06:30]  After a criminal trial  They have a departmental trial  Which is  If you talk to any cops  It's a kangaroo court  And the benefit  It's always against the cops  It's pretty much  Oh yeah  If they find out  You screwed up  Then you're out  I mean trust me  Even if they're found  Innocent in this gym  They're not  Trust me  They're not back  On the streets  The next day  Doing what they were doing  Before  I don't want to see  I'm sorry  I don't want to see  These guys go to jail  And I didn't want to see  The Diallo cops go to jail  Because again  Cops have to account  For every bullet they fire  So no cop is going to go out 
[01:07:00]  And go I'm going to fire  30 shots  And then try to explain it away  With the guy who's unarmed  Exactly  It doesn't make sense  No  But you know again  You have to  If you're on your job  Anyone's on their job  And screws up  To that degree  Even though maybe  There's emotional reasons for it  You know  You're held accountable  And fired  I mean it's the way  It is in jobs  If you're a lawyer  And you're constantly screwing up  Even if your intentions are good  I mean that's a major effort  Yeah  You got a point  It's a major effort  Yeah I agree  Alright  I see  It was a mistake  But it wasn't a crime  Thanks a lot guys  Have a good morning 
[01:07:30]  Alright Steve  Thanks John Minnelli  For police commissioner  What?

[01:11:30]  I didn't even know  He was doing radio  Harvey Harvey  I didn't even know  He was doing freaking radio  I know  And I guess we're competing  Against him here in New York  Are we though  Really  No  When you think about it  I don't know  I don't know  Do you think we really  Share audience  I don't know about that  I don't think you  I don't think you  Can assume that he's just  Going after the black people  No  He doesn't look like  One of those black people 
[01:12:00]  Yeah he does  No he doesn't  I think he does  I don't think so  Did you know  He got in trouble  When he was on in LA  Because he refused  To play rap  With offensive lyrics  So you're telling me  He's talking to the black person  Are you kidding me  And he also got in trouble  Because he insisted  On playing a gospel song  Every day  He's known for playing  What 12 minutes of gospel  To start off his show  Every day  See so again  I will say  We're not sharing 
[01:12:30]  The same audience  Public gospel  See a little tuning in  To listen to gospel music  And him talk about God  They're not coming here  You're right  I don't know  It's not a pest  Making a decision  Yeah  Right  Well the article says  Steve Harvey arrived  18 months ago  In the kingdom  Of the radio shock jocks  Where the royalty included  Howard Stern  Don Imus  And Opie and Anthony  The king of comedy  Surveyed the raunchy landscape  And launched his  Morning drive time show  With some trepidation  And so Harvey  Started his show  Each morning  He starts with 
[01:13:00]  12 minutes devoted  To gospel music  And God  A stark contrast  To Stern's  Salacious satellite  Shenanigans  Or Opie and Anthony's  Weekly Wednesday  Hunt for female flesh  We get it  He's different than us  But then the article  Goes on to say  And this is a quote  From Steve himself  You can't beat me  In the funny department  Oh you can beat me  In the information department  Oh you can get me  In the looks department  But you can't beat me  In the funny department  He thought that was  So funny  That it's mentioned 
[01:13:30]  Two or three times  In the article  But in the funny department  He said  You can't beat me  That's later on  In the article  He just keeps  Reiterating that  You can't beat him  In the funny department  So we took the challenge  Today  We had young Sam  Who has candy in his head  We said  Sam  Listen to Steve Harvey  And find us some funny  Find us some funny  Find us  Steve hanging out  In the funny department  Not the music department  Where he hangs out  During a show 
[01:14:00]  I would gather  Plays music  Yeah  Is that what he does  He doesn't play  That much music  But he plays music  He plays music  So  When did he start his show  Six  Six  I swear to you  Right around 545  We brought this article  To Sam's attention  And we're like  Sam your job today  Is very easy  Just listen to Steve Harvey  Online  And get us some  Some examples of him  Hanging out in the funny department  Funny department  At 7 o'clock  I go  Sam what do you got  So he's been broadcasting 
[01:14:30]  For an hour  Sam goes  Well I got a promo  Where he's trying to be funny  I go  He hasn't done anything funny yet  The article is how  You can't beat him  In the funny department  Funny department  The department of funny  It's because he doesn't compete  So then  We break at around  730 or so  I go  Sam  Anything from Steve Harvey  In the funny department  He goes  Well now I think he has  Finally something on fishing  Fishing  Yes  So first 
[01:15:00]  Here is the promo  This was the only funny thing  He did in the first hour  And it was something  From a past show  Okay  That is running  In some kind of promo  For the show you're listening to  Which is always smart  Let's go into the funny department  Shall we  Alright  Listen closely  Let's be fair about this  Let's be fair  Is this funny  Don't know when we go to the auto shop  With the intent  Of changing a sexual favor  For an auto repair 
[01:15:30]  She's going there thinking auto repair  This is presented to her  Cause I can assure you  His price list  Ain't posted up on the wall  Up on the wall  It has all changed  $29.95  Tune up  $69.95  Come on  Transmission overhaul  $300  She got all that up on there  His price list  Is not up there  All changed  By the way  I gotta interrupt  Why are they laughing  That's the set up  To a bit  There's nothing to be  Laughing about 
[01:16:00]  They're laughing  And going  Come on  That's that fake radio crap  They're laughing and giggling  That's just the set up  To hopefully something  That might be funny  It's just the sound  Of the department of funny  The music  Oh  The funny department  The music in the background  And the music bed  In the background  Right  But these phony radio people  There's nothing to laugh at yet  Yeah wait for the set up  To be done  And then if the  You know  The punch line is funny  Give it a little  I guess  The story was a woman  Like has no money  I don't know  By the way 
[01:16:30]  I have no idea  What he's talking about  I think it's a woman  That wanted to trade  Like sexual favors  To get her car fixed  Yes I think so  Was that it  But the price list  He has up  And he's just listing  The legitimate price list  And I think in the next part  It goes on to the just  I'm guessing what her price list  Would be  Or how she translated  Is that what you think Sam  They're laughing  But basically it's a garage  And you know  We've all been in a garage  And they go  Alright oil change  They got your price list  So that's what  He's setting up  The bit here  And they're all laughing  I'm like why are you laughing  This is just a set up

[01:17:30]  Weekly Mornings  Starting at 6  On 107.5 WBLS  It's not the same audience  Yeah I don't think  That's fine  That's fine  It's not the same audience  But is that funny  Not particularly  No it's kind of  Maybe if you're an open mic  Or somewhere  I think he's a good stand up  I wouldn't say  That was his best joke  In fairness  That was probably  Not the cream of the crop 
[01:18:00]  Yeah but you know what  If you're going to be  Stupid enough to say  In an article  That no one can beat you  In the funny department  Funny department  And so we take  The challenge today  In the first hour  Of the show  That's all we could find  That was the only thing  He did that had something  To do with the funny department  There's a real problem here  Maybe you should have  Talked about something else  In this AP article  Who else is standing  In the funny department  With you  Stalin and Mohammed Akka  Just you three  And you're the champion  Hands down  Look not everything 
[01:18:30]  Anything else  Do we have any more examples  Well now finally  So that was a promo  Yeah  So he didn't do anything  New today  That would be in the  Funny department  Finally around 730  Yeah  Is that fair to say  Yep  He finally did something  That Sam thinks  I swear to God  Sam goes  I think this was  Supposed to be funny  I'm not sure though  You guys decide  Alright  We have another example  So once again  We go into the funny department  With Steve Harvey  Yesterday when we were in Orlando  Uh huh  I went on the two hour

[01:20:00]  The fish  That dealt  He didn't damn  They drowned  The shad  He ain't  Oh I um  Um  She doesn't interject enough  I think that's a problem  Cause there was actually  A moment there  Where there was  A half a second  Of silence  In between  He's like just talking  Without her going  Uh and then what  Oh yeah  How many  Oh my 
[01:20:30]  God  I don't know  What that was  And we wouldn't even  Have gone down this road today  But we're mentioning  This dumb article  Where he says  No one can beat him  In the funny department  Or the department  The department of funny  The ministry of funny  I believe it was  Yeah so we're like  Alright we'll take  The challenge today  We're not scared  And this is what  We can find  This was the funniest  Thing you  You found on his show  In the last hour and a half  I was just waiting  To hear people laughing  And that's how I knew  It was supposed to be funny  Yeah  It was not  It was not taken out of context  Right after that line  He went to a song

[01:37:00]  I think the guy's annoyed  Because he knows  That Steve Harvey's not funny  I was only joking  You know when you mention  In an article  Two or three times  That no one can beat you  In the department of funny  The next day  You should be really funny  Because everyone's gonna pay  A little more attention  To you today  Yeah  And we  Bring the funny  We obviously paid attention  To him  I didn't even know  He was doing radio  In New York  And what we heard so far  Is pretty lame  Let's be honest  Very lame  Alright moving on  They got footage 
[01:37:30]  Of this big plane  I'm obsessed with it  Are ya?  It's all I wanna do  Is get on that big plane  And be rich  Just be wealthy  And flying  In a beautiful  New plane  With the new plane smell  Even the coach  Looks good  Yeah  Because I'll say  I fly continental  But I'll say  Their coach  It's Oscar Schindler  Should hose down  Those planes  Before they take off  Could you give us  Another inch  You greedy  Mother effers  How about another  Inch of leg room  For the scum  You're transporting 
[01:38:00]  Hey that's funnier  Than Shirley Strawberry  I gotta give it to ya  When I said  I gotta give it to ya  When I said  I fly continental  On one of you  Should I say  On the plane  Continental airlines  No actual continents  We hop on them  And fly  No I would have added  What do you mean  What are you saying  What are you saying  Well that I fly  In the air  To fly on plane  Yeah  No  And the airline  Is continental 
[01:38:30]  Oh okay  Oh now we're gonna  Well we got our boots on  Get your boots on  Shut up  Race war  Shut up  This is Lufthansa  That has this big plane  Yeah yeah  Sure  They showed a staircase  It's simple  In my world  I don't want to be  On a plane  That has a staircase  Why not  I don't know  It just seems to be  Too big  The old one  It's too heavy  To be in the air  If it has a staircase  It's really heavy  The old 747s 
[01:39:00]  Had them going up  To the top  They always had two floors  Yeah they had a little  Piano lounge up top  In this one  No in the 747  It's not a bar  Where like 20 people  Were kind of standing  Yeah they're hanging  Out of a bar  How cool is that  You don't have to  Just sit in your seat  That's too creepy  I think  Big ass plane  Well we got the audio  Just in case you missed  What I love about these clips  The German accent  Can't get enough  Of the German accent  Yeah sure  I was thinking today  As we were listening  To this on the news  That you just don't hear  German speak that often  In these times  No  All of a sudden 
[01:39:30]  It just kind of  Scares people  It kind of surprises you  When you hear German speak  It's very rare  Think about it  Here's what  The thing with these planes  They can be configured  For two ways  This one had 500 people  I think they can configure  For over 850  And they said that  In the first class  I've never sat  In the first class  Like this  I've only walked through  And peaked  Where they have those  Big sleeper seat sections  With your own little TV  Like beds  Like a bed  But they have some  That you can configure  And get like a shower  It's like a private suite  Like a little suite  You go in  Private 
[01:40:00]  Bed  Shower  You could just  You could do some  Banging in there  Of course you could  I'm sure you could do that  Like it's not like  Illegal or anything  You could probably  You could probably have  Some sex  There you got your own  Mile high club  Well listen to this  Listen to the German accent  It's the world's largest  Passenger aircraft  The size of a football field  The Port Authority  Had to spend  $179 million  Just so it could land here  Airbus is looking for buyers  And the chief pilot says  It flew like a sports car  Watch this awesome sight 
[01:40:30]  Coming through the clouds  From Terminal 1 at JFK  You had the feeling  Something special was in the air  Lufthansa's Airbus captain  Says this was picture perfect  If you imagine a plane  Of his size  And his weight  You imagine it would move  Like a bus  Or like a truck  But as I said  If you compare it  It would handle  Like a Ferrari  You would think  It would move  Like maybe locomotives  With boxcars  Full of juice  But no  It is like this sports car 
[01:41:00]  Wonderful  Yeah  You can't listen  To anything they say  With that accent  I just think Nazi  Right  I just think Nazi  And I can't get it  Out of my head  Yeah  We are going to configure  With machine guns  And bombs  Goodbye Poland again  Just  I can't get it  Out of my head  That they're Nazis  And they're trying  Real hard over there  They are  I mean they got  A long way to go  They're the worst  When it comes to like  Prosecuting anti-Semitism 
[01:41:30]  And Nazis  Yeah  They really  They don't even allow  The swastika  To be shown anywhere  You get thrown in jail  For talking about  And  But when they talk  It just doesn't sound nice  They should just change  The way they speak  Yeah  It would help out everybody  Come up with a new accent  Yeah  Well there's more  How great would it be though  If like  Say like an airline  American airline  Bought that  Like say Continental  Bought four of them  But only used them  For the Newark  To Buffalo flights  Or Newark 
[01:42:00]  To Pittsburgh  They only used them  On 60 minutes  Or under flights  Horrible flights  Those short little hops  And they were configured  For 60 people  Each one  You had your own room  And dining area  And living room  And ticket for  $304  Jimmy  Can you slow down  You gotta give  Shirley Strawberry  At least a fighting chance  Today  Oh yeah  Shirley Strawberry  What are you in  The competition is what  With your  Comedy affair  A comedy affair  A comedy affair 
[01:42:30]  Sounds like a bad  Like one night thing  On Broadway  A comedy affair  A comedy affair  Starring Jim Norton  And Shirley Strawberry  We get to hear more  German people talk  About the huge plane  The plane was built  To help airlines  Consolidate flights  It holds up  555 passengers  That's 50% more  Than a 747  Airports had huge  Renovation costs  Airbus says  Passengers  Will have fair prices  I compared it  With high definition TV  Which was introduced  To Germany  Last year  And this is high definition  For flying 
[01:43:00]  Now this was as much  A media event  As it was a business trip  One letter of intent  Is already on record  For a customized version  Of the A380  They're not telling us  Who's buying  From JFK  Oh you know what  Fox 5 News  What billionaire  Is buying that  Could you imagine  Who's having to fly that thing  I'm buying one  I don't think it's a billionaire  It's probably a company  It's probably an airline  And by the way  I'm a little depressed  I gotta be honest with you  That's not the clips  We heard in the office  No  There were German accents 
[01:43:30]  All over the place  There were more Germans  By the way  The one German accent  We heard  Jeff in Kentucky  Has something to say  About that  Jeff go ahead  Hey boys  That first guy  That you heard  He's the captain  Of that ship  And he's a Frenchman  That's a French accent  Get out of here  He's a Lutonza pilot  From Germany  Ah no  He's a Frenchman  He's definitely a Frenchman  Play that clip again  And by the way  To the idiot news lady  What billionaire  Is buying that  I don't know  An airline 
[01:44:00]  You idiot  It's not a private  Oh guys  And first of all  The guy's first name  Was Juergen  You dummy  Was it really  Yeah Juergen  The French guy  It's the world's  Largest passenger aircraft  The size of a football field  The Port Authority  Had to spend  179 million  Just so it could land here  Airbus is looking for buyers  And the chief pilot says  It flew like a sports car  Watch this awesome sight  Coming through the clouds  Where's the guy now  Terminal 1 at JFK  Yeah I'll play him  You had the feeling  Something special was in the air 
[01:44:30]  Lutonza's Airbus captain  Says this was picture perfect  Well if you imagine  A plane of this size  And this weight  You imagine it would move  Like a bus  Or like a truck  But as I said  If you compare it  It would handle  Like a Ferrari  That guy might be right  That's German  There's a little French in there  I hear a little French  I hear a little French in there  Whatever it is  He's unclipped  The guy's German  And still had a funny  It's German  Can we get the German clips though  Where they had a German stewardess  That was kind of  Yeah 
[01:45:00]  Funny sounding  Chicken guys  Chicken  Yeah  I made the chicken video  You might have seen  Yeah  That's chicken good  Yeah  Ah man  Say hi to Tanya  What kind of food  They have in first class  On that plane  God it must be  A lovely selection  It probably is  Hey Tanya  Tanya  From Detroit  What's up  Yeah I'm flipping stations  And I just heard  You're a little segment  I came in on the middle of it 
[01:45:30]  About  Alright hold on  Hold on  So you don't know  About the Opie and Anthony show  Right  Now we're in trouble  No I don't  You were flipping through  You were flipping through  What are you usually  Listening to in Detroit  I listen to a lot  Of different stations  I listen to Drew and Mike  On one on one FM as well  Alright  I listen to Steve Harvey  And Steve Harvey  Oh you're defending  Steve Harvey  No I just want to hear  Now this is kind of cool  If she was just  Trolling through  And she kind of  Caught a little bit  Of our show  I'd like to get  A little opinion  On what people think  When they just  Come across our show 
[01:46:00]  Okay  Okay  What opinion  Do you want to know  I find that  What you're saying  Is not that funny  But I also find it offensive  In what  In what way Tanya  Because I'm trying  To understand  This term black hole  What are you  Oh I got ya  It's in reference  To  We do a thing  On this radio show  Where we criticize  A lot of the women  Who are in radio  Because we feel  That they're called  Holes  Because they basically  Are not there  To really offer anything  Except like little nods  Okay  And to calm the boys down 
[01:46:30]  And that's the biggest insult  You could give a woman  Right Tanya  Calling her a hole  That means  That's the only thing  She's good for  Is offering her holes  Right  That was pretty much  So in radio  That's how we truly think  In our personal lives  I don't think that way  But as far as  The radio world goes  I think women are useless  For the most part  And they're just  A bunch of holes  Adding nothing  To the conversation  So with Shirley Strawberry  She's black  She is black  So we call her  The black hole  And which is funny 
[01:47:00]  On many levels  Because a black hole  Also just sucks  All life out of everything  And energy  So it was kind of  A brilliant observation  If you really want  To know the truth  On my part  Opie  From the Opie and Anthony show  Featuring little Jimmy Norton  With the comedy  Wait you've got to be honest  You said our show  Is not that funny  But you just heard  Anthony's riff  On the German pilot  You didn't think  That was funnier  Than his break  On talking about fishing  Honestly  No not really  I mean I will be fair 
[01:47:30]  There are times  When a lot of these shows  Are not funny  Okay but  Some comedians  Can be off  I'm not going to say  That he's funny  All the time  Because he cannot be  And I'm not saying  That he stinks  It's too bad  You've got to have  Some form of intelligence  To listen to the  Opie and Anthony show  Yeah I know  Let's be honest  You probably didn't  Graduate high school  You probably have  Three or four kids  And you're probably  A grandma  At the age of 32  So I guess we have  To give that much  To you  Tanya I'd like 
[01:48:00]  To apologize  I'd like to apologize  I'd like to apologize  Tanya for Opie's  Statement there  That isn't how  This show is  Oh she's gone  Oh good  Now I don't have  To apologize  Why would you  Apologize  Go away  I hate the people  That go  Oh I just slipped  On your station  No you were  Checking us out  Stop  Here's the problem  With something like that  You can't honestly say  I would have liked her  A little bit more  If she A  Would have been  You know  Made me a 
[01:48:30]  If she would have  Just admitted  That that break  That you just did  With that  The German pilot  Was funnier  Than that fishing break  Don't allow  Your personal dislike  Or agenda  To interfere with  What's obviously  A funny thing  You know  Any Jewish joke  She's laughing at  Of course she is  Of course  Alright we got a quickie  And then we're going to get  Into some MacBook karaoke  Yeah I know  We got a break there Sam  But we got to give them  A little more funny  Or a little more  Material that makes them think  This is what happened  On a local news station  In Philly  Oh no 
[01:49:00]  But the major reason  For the sleep issues  Pressure dealing  With family  And family issues  So I fit into your group  With a five month old baby  Who's nursing at home  But what can I do about it  Because I am tired  You know your memory goes  You're like a retard  Because you had no  Short time memory  Seriously  Wow  I love this  Alright  It's what  Wow  Fox 29  Dawn  That's great  Yeah  Philly's Fox 29  After a piece about  Being sleep deprived  She says she can relate 
[01:49:30]  And feels like a retard  You're like a retard  I love it  Yikes  Here listen again  Baby who's nursing at home  But what can I do about it  Because I am tired  You know your memory goes  You're like a retard  Because you had no  Short term memory  Seriously  Well I think there's  Several things you can do  Oh  They must have all  Just went  Oh you are so fired  Did she get fired  She had to apologize  The next day  Oh did she  What a doodle  Me and Jimmy disagree on this 
[01:50:00]  I think it's fine  Because that's how we talk  I would like news people  To talk more like we do  Yeah that would be nice  If they did have the freedom  To just speak  Like normal people  She said like a retard  Our whole lives  I disagree in the sense that  Obviously as a person  I don't care what she does  But like as a newscaster  To say you're like a retard  I kind of understand the station  Saying look you gotta say you're sorry  I like the fact they didn't fire her  This might be semantics 
[01:50:30]  But I think if she said  You  I felt like I was retarded  Is different than  I felt like a retard  Like I felt like I was retarded  Would mean you're retarded  You know  That you have a problem  Not like a retard  Which  But they don't even want you  To say that anymore  Yeah I know  Believe me  They want to get rid of the words  Retard  Retarded  They want to add that  To the list of words  To Ben  No matter who's saying it  It's an unnecessary comparison  She's making 
[01:51:00]  It was innocent enough  Oh yeah  That's why she shouldn't be fired  It was very natural  Very off the cuff  It just sounded like  The way people really talk  She's a newscaster  They have a certain amount  Look they get carte blanche  With content  They don't have to have  Releases signed  They have carte blanche  With a lot of stuff  So again  They should have a different  Standard of behavior  When it comes to something like that  And it's like  You know  We can say what we want to say  In that level  Because we're idiots  And the FCC ties us up  We're like a bunch of retards  In here  I'm sorry  Dude  Wouldn't you watch the news 
[01:51:30]  Every night  If you knew the anchor  Was going to work the word  Retard  Into the stories  What do you mean by that?  Oh  I watched  Exactly what you said  Well she had to apologize  And we got the apology  This is just great  Out of Philly  Fox 29  It is local first  On Fox 29  Hello everyone  I'm Dave Huddleston  And I'm Dawn Stensland  We have a lot to report  During tonight's news  But before we begin  Oh no  We've been here  You know she's sitting there  Before the newscast started  Just going  Oh I gotta do this 
[01:52:00]  Okay how will I do it  So we have a lot to report on  But before we begin  I'd like to  We've been here  And we always say  No we will not  One of our many problems  Oh here it comes  On Stensland  We have a lot to report  During tonight's news  But before we begin  Last night  I made a self-deprecating comment  During our 10 o'clock news here  For which I am truly sorry  I sincerely apologize  To anybody  Who I might have offended  I want to apologize 
[01:52:30]  To all the retards out there  For saying  It would be great  If she said  I'm sorry  I just felt like  Such a faggot  After I said  She said  She apologized  For making a self-deprecating  Oh yeah  She was calling herself a retard  Yeah I know  But it kind of takes away  From the actual apology  I think she was just  Referencing the moment  Yeah  She was trying to reference  The moment  Without saying retard  But it's  Do you see how  It almost takes  Some of the heat off of her  By saying  Look  I was 
[01:53:00]  I was  Beating myself up  I want to apologize  For the way I did it  But  I was doing it  In the context  Of beating myself up  It almost makes it  Not as bad  I used a self-deprecating  It's just great  I love something  It certainly is  I love the apology  But that's the way  It should be handled  You apologize  I mean that was  A stupid thing she said  Then you move on  It's done  You don't fire her  You don't make a big deal about it  Don't act like a retard about it  Just  Get on  Apologize  Back to your job  Imagine if she would have 
[01:53:30]  Amended the apology  And said I want to  Apologize to all mothers  For implying  That we are in any way  Like those genetic abominations  Let me say  For the record  They had to cut to her  You know she's like  Peter Finch in Network  Get her off  Get her off  I love what they mess up  All right  We got to try to save  The big plain German thing  Yeah  We're going to try to save that bit  Because it sounded a little French  A little French  Although what you did there was hilarious 
[01:54:00]  His name was JÃ¼rgen  I didn't hear JÃ¼rgen in the whole story  JÃ¼rgen  I read it  It's in the paper  The paper  We're going to try it again  We found another news clip  That has more German accents  It's a big aircraft  But what is very surprising  Is that it is very calm  So the takeoff was very smooth  And it's really nice  It's modern  The plane was built  To help airlines consolidate flights  It holds up to 555 passengers  That's 50% more than a 747  Airports had huge renovation costs 
[01:54:30]  Airbus says passengers  Will have fair prices  I think the customer of Lufthansa  Will really get a great deal  Of travel value  Especially when we've introduced the A3  I compared it with high definition TV  Which was introduced to Germany last year  And this is high definition for flying  Wow  Maybe we were just  Introduced to Germany  Maybe we were just  Still waking up  Because I heard  Very deep German accents  During that story  It is like high definition television 
[01:55:00]  That's what I heard in my head  I was picturing some kind of Hitler speech  But it was very  It was very subtle  It wasn't even worth doing today  God we must be like really sleepy in the morning  It was like  Didn't it sound different in the office really  Yeah I think when we saw them  They were so German looking  Yeah  That you kind of almost  I would have liked to have it  Slowly land in Lakehurst, New Jersey  With a big swastik on their tail  Burst into flames  Oh we'll get out of the way  Can we point out to the reporter 
[01:55:30]  And how  You have to overstate the obvious  You dope  This was built to consolidate flights  Why else would they build a larger plane  A huge plane  Well no one's flying anymore  So they figured they'd give everyone more room  To play handball  With the airlines going into the tank  Stupid  Let's go to Nikki in Philly  Nikki what's up  Hey my sister was listening to the news that night  And it took the newscaster 20 minutes to respond to her  She sent her an email as soon as she heard it on there  And I thought it was pretty funny 
[01:56:00]  I mean you know there's people out there who get offended  And they get offended at the drop of a hat  But you know  20 minutes it took her  What did your sister's email say?  Oh she said you know she was very offended  Why was she offended?  Wait people really get offended by that stuff?  Apparently they do  Yes  I would understand if you have a kid that is retarded  Maybe she does  Alright  Does your sister have a child with Down syndrome?  Yeah  Oh okay  Wait yes or no?  I didn't hear  No  She was just offended just as a human? 
[01:56:30]  I guess  Jesus  I don't know  What a budinsky  You know why she gets offended  Nikki by the way  This was in the printed version of the story  You know that the station got  Are you ready for this?  What?  23 emails  Get out of here  23  Your sister was one of 23 people that were offended by that  Or at least wrote that they were offended by it  Is your sister a fat nudge?  I'm sorry?  Is your sister a fat nudge?  Is she a do-gooder?  No  Well there were 150,000 emails sent out 
[01:57:00]  But they were sent at  Beat that Steve Harvey  Oh we're in the department of funny now  Department of funny  Alright let's go to Todd in Toronto  Todd what's up?  Hey guys what's up?  Hey  My wife and I were at an amusement park last year  And it was packed  And this chick with Down syndrome  Kind of got in front of us  And you know how you do the side shuffle  When you walk in front of someone?

And I'm like  Yes  She did  I couldn't believe it  It was the funniest thing we've ever seen  That is really funny  It's the R word  We have to call it the R word  They can call each other retarded  Can't say the N word  Can't say the F word  Can't say the R word  That's right  We gotta add that to the list of words  They want to ban  Alright thank you sir  He's gone 
[01:58:00]  I wish we could've got Don Cheadle in studio  Yeah that would've been  I love Don Cheadle  He's good  That would be nice  I don't know if I like this new movie though  No  Adam Sandler's gotta go back to  I don't know  Doing comedies  What he's known for  He's trying to do the  That click  I thought I was gonna see  A great little comedy  The concept was wonderful  And next thing you know  They remind us that  Time really sucks  And eventually no one will give a crap  You're on this earth  Thank you Adam Sandler  Thank you  I just like Don Cheadle 
[01:58:30]  Yeah he's a great actor  He makes me sad  Does he?  My girlfriend and I were watching  Before we go  A movie last night  I swear to god  I was just weeping  What movie?  Wait you were supposed to see  On Golden Pond  That's what we were watching  No  I've seen it 30 times  Dude what has happened to you?  I don't know  It's therapy  I was just  I wasn't sob crying  It was just  I was as calm as I am right now  And fluid  Was just leaking out of my eyes  What  What um  What part?  I swear 
[01:59:00]  When dummy  Was blueberry hunting  Are you kidding?  We've goofed on that  A thousand times  I know  And I told her that  I'm like you don't get it  This is not making me sad  I've seen this  But I just  I don't know why  And then  I'm lost  I got lost  I know the old fella  Just wanted some  Blueberries  Are you lactating Jimmy?  I don't know what's wrong with me  Wow are you emotional  What a Mary  I'm turning into  What happened?  What about Don Cito?  I love Don Cito  But you said you were watching a movie

Oh no no  I just segued into that  Oh he's a guy  That just makes me sad  I think he's great  Alright  My god  If you start crying  At like clockwork  Orange scenes  I'm gonna  Smack your face  I always do  With laughing so hard  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony  Hey thanks for checking us out this morning  Susan from Rochester writes  I have taken up driving my son to school every morning 
[02:00:00]  Just so I can listen to you on my XM  I know I can't be the only soccer mom who is a faithful listener  I would love to hear some warning  I would love to hear some warning from other closet listener moms  And maybe we'll wake up the soccer moms tomorrow morning  With some of their stories  We know they're out there  Yeah we know they're dirty, dirty, dirty moms  People have a little dirty streak in them  Listen to this fiddle  By the way we gotta give away the Macbook  Macbook karaoke 
[02:00:30]  And Ariana stopped by to say hi  And maybe sing us out today  Yeah  So we'll set her up  But really fast  Cocaine won't pay for tolls, dummies  Yeah this is another one of those stories  Where you're like  Oh come on  If you're gonna be doing this  Are you allowed to say dummy still?  Dummy  In today's world?  Yeah there are dummies  Maybe they never heard of Easy Pass  Three Long Island men  Were caught with as much as $4,000 worth of drugs  On the Triborough Bridge on Sunday 
[02:01:00]  All because they couldn't come up with the $4.50 toll  $4.50  Cops said  The trio was busted by MTA Bridges and Tunnel Cops  While trying to get from the Bronx to Manhattan  When Officer Joshua Landon asked to see the driver's license  So the agency could mail him a bill for the toll  Jesus  Well or Jesus  Jesus  Of Syosset  Only had an expired learner's permit  With eight prior suspensions  Police said  So the guy  If you're gonna be transporting some coke 
[02:01:30]  You need a guy with a valid license  A car that everything works on  And you pay attention to all the laws  That's how we used to do it  We need six bucks  You need six bucks  And six bucks  You got $4,000 worth of drugs  What dopes  While Landon was arresting Jesus  Cops  Willie and Greg and Ernesto  Approached the 1996 Chrysler to search it 
[02:02:00]  That's when they said they spotted passenger George Perez  Frantically fumbling around in the back seat  Jorge  Jorge  I'm sure it's like Jesus  Jesus  I say Jesus  And George  Jorge  Let's keep it white today  It's uh  Jesus and George  Jesus and George  Alright Jesus and George  Are driving with some coke  They don't have $4.50  What goes through your head?  Wouldn't you be paranoid to begin with? 
[02:02:30]  Because it is  It sounded like it was  It was cocaine  Yeah  Why wouldn't you make sure you have everything set?  Before you leave  I would have the $4.50 in my hand  The entire time I'm driving  Doing the speed limit  Doing the speed limit  Hey  How's your license?  Ten and two  Everything  Right  When they ordered him out of the car  Bags of cocaine allegedly fell from his lap  Stuffed in his pockets were more bags of coke  As well as a container of liquid angel dust  Worth about $300  A hypodermic needle was allegedly found on the other passenger 
[02:03:00]  All told  Authorities said 110 packets of cocaine  Were recovered with a street value of $3,000 to $4,000  Jesus and George were all charged with possession of a controlled substance  Yeah  That'll happen  How dumb are you?  That's like those guys who watch cops  And you see them get pulled over on the Florida highways or something  Yeah  And they're flying  Doing like 85, 90 miles an hour 
[02:03:30]  And the cop goes  Yeah, I pulled you over for speeding  And of course they're all nervous  They're clenching their teeth  And then the guy goes  Mind if I search your vehicle?  Why wouldn't you be doing the speed limit?  If there's one time you want to pay attention to every law  It's when you're breaking a real big one  I read a book by a guy named Max Mermelstein  It was called The Man Who Made It Snow  And he was a guy  He was a white guy  Who married into a Colombian family  And it was a true story 
[02:04:00]  He became a very high American  And he met Ian Cartel  You know  And he met Escobar  And he met all those guys  And he said that when they would do drops  Like he was instrumental in getting the cocaine dropped out of planes  He said what they would do is when they pick it up  You have one guy driving  And they would always have another car with it  And the guy in the other car would be a decoy  And he'd have a bottle of open alcohol with him  So if a cop pulled over the cocaine car  The other guy would just with the bottle  Take a drink  And then drive into the cop car  Not doing fast 
[02:04:30]  But just smash into it  Enough to  And the cop would boom  And then that guy just pulls out in the traffic  The first guy  Wow  I mean better a drunk driving  That'd be a little scam  Better a drunk driving thing  That you left your life  In prison for  You know  Two tons of cocaine  Or the Medellins chasing you  Those geese  Oh god  You end up hanging out of a helicopter  Hey let's get through this fast  Because then we can get to Ariana  To end this side of the  Opie and Anthony show  It's  MacBook Karaoke  We've got to get a winner for today  Tuesday  We start with Douglas from Utah 
[02:05:00]  You are so beautiful  You are so beautiful  It's Joe Cocker  To me  You are so beautiful  A bit pitchy  Dog  I don't even know what that means  I just like saying it  Bring it on home 
[02:05:30]  You're everything I hope for  See if we can hit this  You're everything I need  Yeah he doesn't really have the  Joe Cocker oomph  You are so beautiful  Does he do the end  Alright  Alright you want to hear it  He's not bad 
[02:06:00]  He's not bad  But there's a couple of parts in there  That were a little like  He's not bad  For a prison raper  He's not bad  I mean it's  It's not like one of those awful things  Where you're like  Oh my god  Guy probably does well on karaoke  Can I read a really dumb instant feedback  Sure  We're making fun of Steve Harvey 
[02:06:30]  And we should  He sucks  Let's be honest  He sucks  And he says no one can beat him  In the department of funny  And it's really pissing off some people today  For some reason  And Sharon from Jersey  Sharon Brown  She went out of her way  To go on our website  To find the instant feedback link  To comment  About a show that she doesn't listen to  Alright  Which would be us  Opie and Anthony  Yeah  She writes O&A  And she even says O&A  The hardcore fans call us O&A  So she even knows the lingo  Sharon Brown writes  O&A 
[02:07:00]  I typically listen to Steve Harvey  Mornings  Or 101.5 in Jersey  And sometimes Howard on Sirius  Yeah  I listen to  The Chick Chuck and Butchie Afternoons  Or sometimes Wendy Williams  When I can stomach her hate  There is a reason  The ratings are what they are  Like she's making fun of us  There's a reading  But she obviously listens enough  To know where the instant feedback is  And Sharon  Don't hide behind your dumb email 
[02:07:30]  Give us a call  We'll discuss this  She listens to like 12 radio shows  Urban radio stations do very well  In New York City  It's just the way it is  They don't have the iPods  And there's a couple of stations  And that's what they listen to  Whitey's buying up all the iPods  That happens  Sorry  People want to know  If you were weeping  During that song there Jimmy  You know  Sometimes you try to open up  And you just get kicked in the teeth  And I didn't finish the movie  I have to watch the rest of it today 
[02:08:00]  Alright  Oh no  Hey we got to get Arianna in here  And we got to get a winner for this  We're running out of show  This is Kristen from Jersey  Is this better than Douglas from Utah  This is Let's Get It On  I've been really trying baby  Trying to hold back these feelings for so long  And if you feel like I feel baby  Come on

I've got to give it to the  I've got to give it to Aladdin guy  Really?  There were two really good singers in there though  Jimmy?  I've got to vote for Kristen of course from Woodbridge  Why?  Because I like her  I think she was good  Sam, who do you think? 
[02:10:30]  I like the Aladdin guy  All right, Aladdin guy wins it  We're going to make it really quick and easy today  Joe from Florida  Who just sung that last song  Congratulations  You just won the unbelievable new MacBook  Create your own music, movies, websites, whatever  And bring it wherever you go  Head to the Apple store or Apple.com to check it out  It's going to be a shame  When that thing's on the evidence shelf  At his local police department  Full of pictures that he probably shouldn't have downloaded  We timed this last segment really, really badly  We got Ariana from yesterday's show 
[02:11:00]  She was just unbelievable with that Whitney Houston song  So she's going to sing us out today  How are you, Arietta?  I'm doing okay, how are you?  Good, all warmed up, ready to sing?

[02:13:30]  I'm not what you  You need  Here it comes again  And I  I  Will always  Love you  I  Will always  Love you  See you tomorrow 
[02:14:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show  God  Do  Love you  I 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that was John S. from Hartford.  We went back to the acoustic version of Ecstasy of Gold. 
[02:17:30]  He requested that while we were at the other joint, so we said, yeah, what the hell.  Jimmy, very annoyed.  Anthony, very annoyed.  And I'm very, very happy today.  Just get in here and just get annoyed.  There's no reason to be.  Well, I don't know.  I don't really...  I don't understand things.  I don't understand why, like, things change every day.  No matter what studio we're in, there's always some kind of problem.  It's like the first rule of radio is to make sure everything works for us. 
[02:18:00]  Just make it work.  So what's the problem on your end?  And then we'll get to Jimmy, who's pounding the table and spitting over there.  Yeah, I'll talk again.  You know, I said the computer here sucks ass.  It's hooked into that ridiculous XM corporate system.  And I said, I just want an internet connection, a computer, and the camera for this.  I don't need it hooked up to the fucking network.  You need the passwords and everything.  Because now I can't load the appropriate software on here to make it work. 
[02:18:30]  So, again, we're going without this camera.  I guess Stan's got Open 2 working.  So we have one camera.  What's the problem?  No sound.  Now I've got to get somebody else to stream the sound.  It's ridiculous.  We've got to make sure that everything is set up and ready to go.  We've said it a million times.  Yeah.  Not pointing any fingers at anyone.  I don't know what the issue is.  I don't know who to blame.  But where we sit, we just need everything to work when we come over here. 
[02:19:00]  That's it.  Yeah.  Stop assuming that we could just do all the heavy lifting without your help.  We need help.  The Pal Talk cameras are very important to this radio show.  We want them on every day.  So someone should check that.  Someone should make sure the studio isn't like a morgue.  Half the time, that's the problem.  Yesterday, we did our show with our coats on.  Yeah, freezing.  It doesn't make for good radio when you're wearing a winter coat.  It kind of takes away from the fun because you just feel like the whole time you're ready 
[02:19:30]  to leave.  Yep.  Yeah.  Don listens every day.  Don, take care of the problems, please.  Don's been amazing for this channel lately.  Not lately.  For a very long time.  He'll get it done.  And then Jimmy has a problem because what happened, Jimmy?  Thank you, Lee Abrams.  I appreciate you sending me this.  My desk is in an abomination.  Yeah.  There's shit all over it.  Most of it's...  I mean, sometimes I let stuff pile up because I never...  I'm never in the office.  Yeah, we're never here anymore.  Never. 
[02:20:00]  The only reason our office is still there is for when we get fired eventually from regular  radio.  We're going to have to come back here and retake our office.  It's just sitting there.  Waiting.  Yeah.  It's waiting.  There's squatters in there, really.  Yeah, pretty much.  We're collecting rent.  It's like, I don't know.  We got tenants.  But eventually, we're going to take over that office again.  Subletting.  My desk is a disaster.  Yeah.  It was before, you know, with my stuff.  I'm not sounding like a Mr. Clean over there, but now it's just piled up.  It's like a storage desk now.  Could you guys go on... 
[02:20:30]  Would you mind if those guys...  Oh, not at all.  All right.  Could you find stuff on Anthony's desk and Jimmy's desk?  Just some items that might be interesting.  There's a lot of that stuff that's not mine.  They're piling shit up on my desk.  So I get this thing.  I happen to just go in there and look.  And it's buried under stuff.  It was from fucking Lee Abrams.  Sent February 26th.  And it was an advanced Black Sabbath thing with Theo with a new song on it.  Yeah.  And we could have played it, at least over here, a fucking...  Before anybody.  And it was played commercially March the 5th. 
[02:21:00]  So...  Oh, I would have had the jump on that.  Might have been nice.  But what?  Someone just threw it on your desk?  Saying, oh, Jimmy...  Obviously, it's very obvious that Jimmy checks his desk every day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Throw it on the pile of garbage.  Mind-boggling.  And I wouldn't care if all the stuff there was mine, but there's shit in front of the  desk that has nothing to do with me.  Yeah.  It's just a disaster, that office.  The desks.  Oof.  I'm not talking about my stuff, which is my response, but I'm talking about stuff that's 
[02:21:30]  not mine.  The fucking box of cocks.  Throw it out!  No, we're bringing that back.  All right, well then fucking they should put it somewhere, not in front of my desk.  And then put fucking Sabbath stuff under it.  But you said you don't use your desk.  That's why it's there.  It's out of the way.  It's out of the way.  Then bring in this stuff.  But you know why I'm not mad that this was here?  Because I've seen this.  This coffee thing.  I know that.  I said, I just leave it on the thing.  I figured we'd put the box of cocks near the desk of the guy that really kind of likes 
[02:22:00]  it.  Ooh, coffee though, dude.  Who sent the coffee?  Can I have one of those?  You can have both of them.  I don't want it.  I only drink Starbucks.  Thanks for nothing.  No, I'll drink it.  It's the Nashville Coffee Company.  Who are they?  I don't know.  I imagine they're in Tennessee.  Are they in Nashville?  No.  They're in Hackettstown, New Jersey.  Oh, jeez.  Hi, guys.  Just wanted to write and say we love this show and listen every day.  And this is pretty funny.  Thanks for entertaining us.  And my personal favorite line of the day from Little Jimmy, Steve plus acting equals zero. 
[02:22:30]  I guess I didn't remember I said that, but it's true.  And they make the best coffee in the world out of Hackensack?  I don't know.  I'm sure it's fucking lovely.  They use the water from the swamps?  It's really awful.  All right.  Well, we got some controversy.  We got Kristen from New Jersey on the line.  Kristen, what's the problem today?  Hi.  Hi.  I just feel like I was kind of chipped for MacBook Karaoke.  Hey, hold on a minute.  Yeah.  You're off. 
[02:23:00]  Oh.  Go ahead.  Is the radio out there?  Can you guys hear us?  Yeah.  Why don't we turn on the radio for a second?  Go ahead, Kristen.  I feel like I was kind of chipped for MacBook.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  You cut me off, and I just, I don't know.  Everyone.  I'm not trying to be a.  Oh, well, you are.  Everyone feels like they were chipped.  I know.  I'm not trying to be.  They really are, though.  See?  Now, you.  I know it was pretty good.  I had two fans.  All right. 
[02:23:30]  Let me see.  Kristen from Jersey.  Oh, yeah.  You were really good.  Actually, you did a good job.  We just decided to give it to the gay guy today.  But let me, let's listen to you.  Not that we know that if Joe's, you know, that.  Well, he sounded gay in the song.  He kind of sounded.  And he's just singing a fruit Disney song from a cartoon.  Yeah, he could have picked any song, and he picked a Disney song, so.  Say no more.  It's from Aladdin.  Right.  I know.  Fabulous.  It wasn't like, this is Slayer.  Yeah.  It was, this is from Aladdin. 
[02:24:00]  Aladdin.  Well, let's listen to you again, Kristen.  We'll critique you now that you're live on the phone, okay?  Well, no.  I know what you're going to say.  No.  You're alive.  You know, don't think we're so predictable, Christine.  Yeah, we, this isn't, this isn't really about a production contest.  Sometimes.  We understand the music isn't going to be.  Sometimes we surprise people and go, wow, I thought they were really going to do what  they always do.  But sometimes we do the right thing.  Let's take a listen here.  Okay.  This is Kristen from New Jersey.  She's on the phone.  I've been really trying, baby. 
[02:24:30]  Trying to hold back these feelings for so long.  And if you feel like I feel, baby.  Come on.  Oh, come on.  Oh, let's get it on.  Yeah.  Let's get it on.  Let's love, baby.  Let's get it on. 
[02:25:00]  Ooh, let's get it on.  Well, well, yeah, there's nothing wrong with me loving you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Damn, I got to say, Kristen, you got ripped off today, man. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, you might have been robbed.  Well, I'm not, I guess I was.  That was good.  But I'm not trying to like.  Oh, well, sucks to be you.  She got ripped off, though.  That's a blow.  She certainly did.  I think she did.  Somebody wasn't paying attention today, because that was a really, really good rendition.  Yeah, the judges must have been drunk.  Wow, man, that sucks. 
[02:26:00]  Sucks to be you today.  A good voice.  Yeah.  Good control.  But who won?  Whole fish should call back, because we wanted to talk to her and everything, too.  I don't know what happened there.  Where was our winner, though?  That's what I want to hear.  Can you hear us out there?  No, huh?  No, it's off.  No?  No, not a word.  Turn around now for me.  See? 
[02:26:30]  There's a guy that made the walk over today, the only one besides Arianna and her brother.  Yeah.  And some guy from Little Rock, Arkansas comes running up to us all excited.  Literally.  Literally.  And his jeans were so tight that, look, I'll be honest, I had to take a look.  And he was sporting a hard-on as he ran up to us excited that he was doing the walk over  with us today.  And he's out there.  He can't hear us.  My creep has a boner.  So I grabbed Jimmy as we were across the street.  I was giggling like a little girl. 
[02:27:00]  I'm like, dude, you've got to check out this guy's package.  This guy's got a boner.  Did you see it, Jimmy, or no?  I couldn't tell if it was his hard-on or if he's all bad.  Whatever it is, I'd rather be him than me.  You're impressed.  See, Jimmy doesn't want to laugh right now, because he's still mad.  I'm beyond, I want to, I want to fuck, I want to open hand and smack somebody in the  face.  Ooh.  Mm.  I don't think Travis would mind.  No, neither would I, actually.  He's a sweet boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are they gathering things from the desks? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, I guess they are.  Yeah, they'll have that in a second.  Maybe we could get a mic out there and meet the people that did the walk over today.  Let's say hi to John in North Carolina.  John, what's up?  Later, Jen.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what did Kristen really expect?  We all know you guys always get pulled back to the gay.  That's not true.  Yesterday, we gave it to a really good singer, and then today, we went with the gay guy.  We're just trying to mix it all up, like Anthony said.  No.  We want to keep you guessing.  Back to the gay. 
[02:28:00]  We want to keep you guessing.  How do you know that guy was gay?  Where's that song?  All right.  Where's the song?  All right.  Because how dare you say this is gay?  That this guy is gay just because he's singing a song from Aladdin?  Right.  Didn't Aladdin go on Broadway?  John, hold on a minute.  We're giving you a chance here.  We don't think this is gay.  Let's listen together.  Let's all listen.  All right.  Okay.  I can show you the world, shining, shimmering, splendid. 
[02:28:30]  Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?  I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder, over sideways and under, on a magic carpet ride.  A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view, no one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming. 
[02:29:00]  You're a kid toucher.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Okay.  Okay.  You're right.  It's not gay.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm glad you saw it our way.  There goes John from North Carolina.  He's a fag.  We don't know, man.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  I wish I knew how to quit you. 
[02:29:30]  We don't know for sure.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  We have no idea.  Yeah, that was a little.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  Jimmy's just staring at that black Sabbath CD.  Oh, my God.  Wanting to go in a time machine.  We're just trying to get you out of the park.  I don't even have a ticket for the show.  Do you know who's trying to help me?  The fucking radio chick.  I love her.  She's sure because her boyfriend is the brother of the guy drumming for them now.  Yeah.  So hurt. 
[02:30:00]  I'm mad at her.  I'm just annoyed.  It is annoying.  Yeah.  Do you hear that song yet?  Of course you have.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Part of it I've heard.  I haven't heard it the whole time.  No?  You're right, Jimmy.  Just annoyed.  Yeah, I mean, I'll be fine.  It's my own problem.  I'm just irritated.  I just want to fucking, you know.  I get the vibe.  I know what it is.  It's just his fucking...  Oh.  Yeah.  He's fucking pissed.  Our mail system's a little shaky.  It fucking stinks. 
[02:30:30]  It does, as a matter of fact.  Let me look at a little piece of mail I got that was on my desk.  All right.  Is it from the fucking draft board to tell you about Vietnam?  That's why they fucking handle shit around here?  What is it?  Oh, boy.  What is it?  Seems I'm late on my parking fee.  A couple of months.  You just got this?  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Let's see.  Total charges.  Yep.  It's a couple of months late.  How about we get three big boxes?  One says Jim Norton mail.  One says Opie mail.  And one says Anthony mail.  And we just know we have to check that box on our own.  Yeah.  Or because the desk is such a crowded area.  I'll go over there sometimes and there's shit.  There's nothing.  It's not my stuff that's on there.  It's not like it's all my stuff piled up.  There's stuff that's not mine under the desk and all over.  It's like fucking just...  I know you got to get storage somewhere. 
[02:31:30]  Huh?  You should get storage somewhere.  Are you annoyed, Jimmy?  Beyond comprehension.  Like really deeply?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Because I just want to go fucking see Dio play with them.  And I want to hear the new song.  But you know what?  It wasn't meant for me to hear the new song.  And a lot of times you don't get what you want.  That's the way life is.  And you know, of course, why should you get what you want when people aren't doing what  they're supposed to be fucking doing?  And they're just throwing your shit all over because they don't give a fuck if you get  it or not.  But then again, they have problems in their life too. 
[02:32:00]  So I should probably try and look on the bright side.  It's not easy being there.  Although it's not easy being me either.  Try being a sex addict who cries with his girlfriend because you're in therapy like  a faggot and can't even get fucking tickets to see Sabbath because nobody in CBS will fucking  help you because they don't, you know, why should they care though?  Les is worried about his thing and Joel is worried about his thing and Tom is worried  about his thing and John is worried about his thing.  Everybody's busy and they got no time to do stuff for people who they don't even consider  a real third member of the show.  Why the fuck do they give a fuck?  It's all his fault.  I think that's why I'm that powerful fucking faggot in his tie. 
[02:32:30]  Strangle him to death.  Hopes.  I would never do that.  Of course, I'm kidding.  I would never strangle anybody with a tie.  That would be illegal and against the law.  But I'd choke him with my cock.  That I'd certainly do.  I'll bet he'd like that.  Nice deep throat fucking.  Because maybe he's gay but that's okay because I accept him for who he is.  He's got his opinion and I've got mine.  That's all that really matters.  My opinion matters because you're my fucking boss.  So I guess your opinion is the one that matters. 
[02:33:00]  Sitting there for a fucking month?  That's what bugs me.  If it was a few days but February 26th, man.  I'm never in there.  Well, technically that would be a month.  Almost, yeah.  Three weeks.  Yeah.  Almost a month.  It's just angering.  Yeah.  Kind of important.  All right.  Anyway.  Hey, can we get a mic on the guy from Little Rock, Arkansas?  Is he drinking a beer out there?  Is it? 
[02:33:30]  Or is he drinking a Red Bull of sorts?  All right.  We're going outside with the mic.  And has the...  There we go.  Hey.  Can you...  Oh, I guess we got to turn the sound on.  So they could hear us.  It would be smart to just walk the guy in here.  No, but we like doing it this way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's up, sir?  I like through the glass.  Hey.  Now, you kind of creeped everyone out because we walked about a block and all of a sudden  he came...  I'm going to stand up.  I had my back turned. 
[02:34:00]  Stand up, please.  Don't you know the rules?  We can see you.  And all of a sudden he came running up to us, all excited.  I had my back turned.  I missed you guys.  I saw Kim was being hit.  Extremely.  You were extremely excited, right?  Not that excited, no.  No.  It seemed like you were excited.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  Big fan of the show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very big.  Very, very, very.  Huge fan of the show.  Yeah.  I listen to it every day.  Huge.  Throbbing fan of the show.  Did you notice us walking?  Well, I had my back turned.  I was looking the other direction at that jewelry store. 
[02:34:30]  I turned around and I saw Kenny's big head.  So I knew it was you guys.  Did that excite you?  Well, I was like, oh, there goes the guys I'm going to miss besides the run and catch up.  Yeah.  Because I want to come up here.  Yeah.  Cool.  Pole vault and catch up.  And you're from Little Rock.  Yeah.  Cool.  Little Rock.  Make your own rhymes.  That's, yeah.  So what do you do down there?  I'm an insurance adjuster.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is it hard for you to adjust or no? 
[02:35:00]  No.  No.  No.  No adjustment needed, obviously, right?  No adjustment needed.  Just a photo with Jimmy.  Just let it sit there.  Right?  Yeah.  You want a photo with Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy, take a photo with the guy.  Sure, I'll do that on a break.  Take a picture.  You want to take a little picture?  Jesus.  Jimmy's going out there.  Just look at it.  I need a real photo, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy is now going out there.  Oh, my God. 
[02:35:30]  Look.  Oh, Jesus, dude.  You can see it sideways.  Yeah.  The side view is great.  I told you.  What is going on?  Dude, dude, look.  Come on.  What?  What's going on?  What's going on with you, sir?  You have to...  Oh, my God.  It's getting bigger. 
[02:36:00]  Holy shit.  What the fuck is going on?  Am I right now, Jimmy?  I don't know what it is.  What's going on?  Fucking...  That's not going to work.  Did you see from the side?  I...  I...  It blocked...  It blocked the Ron and Fez sign.  What does it look like, Jimmy?  Like there's a Haitian family living in it. 
[02:36:30]  That's astounding.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  All right.  What's your name again, sir?  Jeffrey.  Jeffrey.  Jeffrey.  Jeffrey.  Jeffrey, uh...  The gang has noticed something about you.  I hate to disappoint Jimmy.  It's just a cell phone.  No, there's...  We saw the cell phone.  That's way down there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you ran up to us on the street, that's why I ran away, because you were sporting like 
[02:37:00]  wood.  Did you like take a Cialis or something, and you're just getting like...  Viagra or something.  Something?  No.  Ariana, turn around.  You see that?  Goes away.  No.  Now you don't see it?  Well, when Jimmy was out there, it was very obvious.  When he turned like sideways a little...  It actually went...  You must have been really...  It was talking.  No, when he turned sideways, Anthony saw the same thing. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was like kind of standing out.  I don't know, sir.  Apparently, you got a huge cock.  That's what we're getting at.  That's what we were getting at.  That's not the worst thing in the world.  Yeah.  You know, you want people to know you have a huge cock.  I guess.  Yeah?  Are you sporting?  No.  You doing all right in that department?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Yeah?  All right.  All right.  Just wondering.  How big a boy are you, sir?  Yeah, what would you say?  I don't know.  Oh, yes, you do.  Eh, roundabout figure.  Hey, how many are Travis's hands? 
[02:38:00]  Where's Travis?  Oh.  The cute girl over there that's...  Travis, go look at Jeffrey.  Yeah.  Why Jeffrey?  Why Jeffrey, by the way?  Shouldn't it just be Jeff at this point in your life?  It doesn't matter either way.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's Travis.  I don't know.  Take your hands out of your pockets a minute.  Dude, that's not a cell phone, Jimmy.  Just see that.  Is that all...  Are you all cock or all bag? 
[02:38:30]  I'm neither.  Dude.  Just average.  What the fuck?  It's right there.  That's not a cell phone?  Maybe he's really soft and nervous, so he's standing straight out.  That might just be a helmet.  Might just be a little...  That might just be a helmet.  Yeah, that might just be...  Like, sometimes your dick will be poking straight out.  It looks like it's a big...  My manager...  Now, Jonathan has a fucking water balloon taped to his leg.  You've seen it, right?  No, I haven't seen it.  I've pointed it out.  You've seen it, right?  I've pointed it out to people, and it's an anomaly.  Honestly, you've never pointed that out to me.  It's a fucking... 
[02:39:00]  It runs down the side of his pant leg, and there's something wrong with him.  And it's a ball?  No, it's long.  It's like...  It's fucking...  It looks like that thing that Chinese people carry on fucking New Year's Day.  That long fucking centipede thing they run down the street with.  So it's his cock?  It's a cock.  It's ball.  It's just everything.  It's fucking drugs taped to his leg.  I don't know why.  He must get stopped at airports all the time.  Let's call him and ask him about it.  He's probably not up at 6.30.  He wouldn't answer his phone.  Oh, he's in L.A.?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Jeffrey, sit back down, please. 
[02:39:30]  You're making everyone nervous.  Get the blood back to your head.  Yeah, just enjoy the show.  That's good.  What a cock on that gentleman.  And Jonathan Branstein is all cock.  And what are we going to do with Ariana today?  Tell her to drive a tractor trailer in a Peeley Herman movie?  Just kidding.  She did a bang-up job.  Yes.  Why don't we talk to Ariana real fast?  Look, now you pissed her off.  Why are you mad?  Are you mad, Ariana?  I would never say anything like that.  Tell them Large Marge sent ya. 
[02:40:00]  See?  See?  Here's these things.  She's seen the movie.  Jimmy's basically saying you're fat and a mess and stuff.  No, no, I wouldn't say that.  I would never say that at all, man.  I wouldn't say that.  I think she'd never do that.  A bang-up job.  Absolutely.  Large Marge was not that fat.  It was just her name.  She was just big and cranky.  Well, at least Large Marge was, you know, pretty in the movie.  Not really.  That's not what I mean.  That's not what I mean.  So what are you trying to say?  I don't know.  She's upset, Jimmy. 
[02:40:30]  You all right, Ariana?  I'm fine.  She's fine.  Yeah.  All right.  You want a cookie?  No.  Try not to eat sugar.  I want a cookie, but I don't have it.  When are you going to start?  The cookies are over there.  Wait, wait.  What do you mean, when are you going to start?  When are you going to start?  Well, she said she's trying not to eat sugar and, you know.  What do you mean by that?  What?  What do you mean by when are you going to start?  You're implying something by saying that.  What are you talking about?  Talking about what you were just talking about.  Oh.  Awkward. 
[02:41:00]  You said it.  Yeah.  Let them go by sometimes.  That's the beauty of me.  Awkward.  There you go.  It's like one of those wedding videos.  I'd like to say hi to the couple.  She's holding the microphone.  Is that your brother?  To wish them 20 years of good luck.  Yeah, this is my brother.  Our blood brother?  Yes.  Wow, really?  Sideways, we look the same.  All right, turn sideways.  Yeah, same Jewish nose.  Oh, yeah.  He looks British.  Really?  Yeah, you look British.  Yeah.  You look like Prince Harry. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I always send him pictures to tell him that he looks like him.  Like young Prince Harry.  What's bro's name?  Gabe.  Gabe, have you ever seen Ariana naked?  As a kid?  Even by accident.  Like you said, awkward.  But you have, though, right?  By accident.  Tell me the story.  Have you seen your sister naked?  Actually, no.  I've never seen my sister naked at all.  Gabe, you want to tell us the story?  It's obvious that you have.  I don't know.  How old were you?  I don't remember. 
[02:42:00]  First time.  What's the age difference between you two?  Five years.  She's 30.  I'm 25.  She's older.  Okay.  So, yeah, you've seen her naked.  Hopefully, like, in the budding years.  The budding years?  The budding years started very early.  Oh, they did, huh?  Nice.  Nine.  When did you get those?  Nine.  Eleven.  Eleven?  You started getting those?  She was four.  Eleven?  You were the first to get the boobies, right?  First before whom?  Like the rest of the girls.  Um, yeah, but I think girls now, they've developed earlier. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Not when I was that age.  It's the hormones and the food.  You know that.  Oh, that's what they said.  Yeah, it's a conspiracy.  Ah, sure it is.  Um, so you were eleven.  When did you start checking out your sister naked, Gabe?  Uh...  We know what was happening.  When?  I didn't.  You catch, I don't know, maybe, maybe you, by accident, you walk in in the bathroom.  I don't remember.  Oh, is that what you did?  Yeah.  And then you saw her.  And then I photographed, and I just, it was awesome.  Yeah.  Was she, uh, was she completely naked when you saw her naked? 
[02:43:00]  I don't remember.  You do remember.  You do remember.  It's a very awkward moment.  Would it help if we got her out of the room for a little while?  No.  You ever see him naked, Ariana?  No.  Because I'll be honest with you.  Would you like to?  Because we can make that happen.  I'll be honest with you, see, because you're covering up.  He's a pale white guy, and I'm not interested in seeing that, and especially since he's my brother.  Wait, wait, wait.  You don't like white guys?  Hmm?  You like black guys?  He's pale.  I love how the brother thing was the second thing that she didn't like about him.  Yeah, the fact that if he was tan, I'd fuck him.  He's really got freckles.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  He's pale, so.  Oh, yeah, and he's also my brother.  I would have thought maybe it's my brother would have been the first thing.  You never seen those jugs unleashed?  Would you like to?  No comment.  Who's married out there?  Oh, boy.  Would your husband mind if your brother felt you up?  No.  Oh, he wouldn't?  Okay.  All right, good.  Gabe, feel away.  That's the answer we needed.  My dad has a heart condition, and I don't want to kill him today.  Yeah, that's right.  Actually, I was talking about you guys yesterday, and he's got like a Spanish accent, and he's 
[02:44:00]  like, oh, Pia and Anthony are shit.  Oh.  Yeah, he's really angry.  He doesn't like you guys.  He doesn't like the fact that we're on the show.  Wait, but you guys have Spanish in you?  Yeah, we're Argentinian.  You are?  Really?  Yeah, I speak fluent Spanish, which you never believe, because I got the complexion of a  urinal.  I just stole his line.  That's all right.  How come your dad doesn't like the show?  I don't know.  He's, you know what he says to me?  He's like, you know what I like?  I like Kubi and the Guardian Angel guy in the morning.  What's his name?  Sliwak.  Sliwak and Kubi.  I like them. 
[02:44:30]  Really?  I don't like this shit.  I'm like, all right, you're entitled to your opinion.  I listen to Mayor Bloomberg every Friday.  He's a wack job, my dad, but he's very funny.  Dullard.  I used to like Mayor Giuliani's show.  Ah, yes.  Ask the Mayor.  I haven't heard Bloomberg's version, but Giuliani was hilarious.  Yeah.  People would call him up and ask him to fix a pothole.  Yeah.  Curtis and Kubi.  I just don't like the way Curtis rhymes.  We got the mobsters with the lobsters.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jimmy, really?  Jimmy, we'd like to move forward with the show, but yesterday you did some terrific 
[02:45:00]  picture your sister naked things.  You want to do one for Gabe and Ariana?  Okay.  What?  Don't worry, man.  Your father's not listening at this point.  Just look over.  I want all the girls out there.  Wait.  I want them to look at each other as you say this.  You're not touching.  You want them to be nude, too?  Yeah.  You're not touching.  Just look each other in the eye as Jimmy says what he's going to say.  Yeah.  Just look each other.  It's cool.  Picture all the girls out there.  Picture your brother nude, and you walk into his room.  And he's got one hand holding his balls, and the other hand, he's squeezing his cock, 
[02:45:30]  and the tip is red, and there's a clear drop of fluid on the tip, and he just waves it  at you.  He just waves it at you gently, like, come here.  Come here.  And the clear pre-cum just strings off the tip.  Yeah.  And he takes it, and he rubs it between his fingers, and he tastes it.  You guys should write gay porn.  No, I'm just saying.  You do.  No, that's not gay porn.  That was more incest porn.  Write it.  Okay.  There was a chick involved.  Write it. 
[02:46:00]  They live it.  All right.  So what else can we...  You don't want to share the story of seeing her naked?  It was so long ago.  I don't remember details.  You remember it.  Let me tell you something.  You remember those things.  There was a time...  It has to be fucking...  And you used to make his sister and her friends do headstands so he could get a peek.  One time, my sister was bending over at the table, and her shirt came down, and it was  before she was wearing a bra, she was just a budding, young, pubescent girl, and I saw her little nubs. 
[02:46:30]  How much older are you?  12 years.  No, I don't know.  Four years older, something like that.  Just her little...  But her little buds.  I saw them, and I was disgusted.  Was it all nip?  It was all nip.  That's all I saw.  My little sister was budding, and I had to look at it.  It's like, come on, put on a training bra or something. 
[02:47:00]  She just leans over, and I had to see her little buds.  All nip.  So I slipped my hand in there and tweaked one.  Yeah.  The first live tit I saw was a girl who worked for a vacuum cleaner repair, and she was trying  to fit with her in a vacuum store, and she leaned forward.  I'll never forget the side of those little cone tits.  Yeah.  I just kept walking over and peeking down.  I don't know if I saw them.  I think I saw them.  I actually got a lot of peeks, I think.  They're bare tits.  It's still sexy.  First live boob I ever saw was my mom in Kachog, a little family getaway, and she was taking 
[02:47:30]  care of one of my little brothers and bent over.  What?  What?  She was taking care of one of my little brothers.  Taking care of, like, I don't know, tying a shoe or something.  Oh, uh-oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the first live boob.  Oh.  I know.  Dude, I got a vacuum.  That's the truth, though.  I believe you.  You got the vacuum cleaner, girl.  I'm turned on thinking about how many times I saw it.  She must have known.  Oh, maybe it was exciting you, and she knew it.  She was like, on one day, I'm getting a rod.  Jesus.  I want to go compare with fucking Jeffrey. 
[02:48:00]  Little rock out there.  Jeffrey was soft.  He'll laugh at my cock.  Yeah, the first vag I saw was when I made my sister's friends do the handstand competition.  Yeah.  My sister was having a sleepover party, and I noticed one of the girls was wearing a night  gown.  The little Kelly girl that lived down the block.  She was wearing a nightgown, but she wasn't wearing any undies with it.  How do you know?  I just knew.  I think because I saw the other ones, you could kind of see the undies through, because 
[02:48:30]  the girls that age and back then were the big bloomers and stuff, and she just wasn't  wearing any for some reason.  I don't know, and I was like, okay, headstand contest.  How old are you?  19?  Yeah, I was like 19.  No.  I was probably 9 or 10.  But that means she was like 6.  Let me think.  Or 1.  1.  1.  Can't even walk yet, but you're making a big headstand.  No, I was older than that then. 
[02:49:00]  Let me think.  Well, she's 3.  Eh, 10, 12.  Maybe 11 then.  8.  Yeah, she's probably 11.  And she had a friend that was like 9 maybe or something like that.  I didn't care.  That age.  I just wanted to see something.  So I made the girls line up on the wall, and then they flipped themselves up to do this  headstand, and all their nightgowns flopped down over their heads.  And I was like, okay, time is starting now.  Make sure you, you know, it's a contest.  And I was just staring at that girl's badge. 
[02:49:30]  Or did they even care?  I don't know.  They didn't care.  They didn't know.  Whatever it was, I was catching the view I needed.  That's all I needed.  I remember that there, Sonny.  So I'm sure you remember.  Yeah.  Now tell us the story.  There is no story.  Yeah.  All right.  Incidentally, I didn't mean to lie, but I did.  The first breast I saw was much younger.  It was Janice, the same first vagina I saw, and the same first ass I saw.  Yeah.  Wow.  All in the same girl.  Oh, yeah.  She put her ass and pussy on my face. 
[02:50:00]  I had to put together like a fucking Frankenstein bitch in my head with all the different parts  I saw.  I remember the cool feel of her ass cheeks against my face.  She touched your face with her ass?  I think I kissed her ass and her pussy.  Wow.  How old are you?  Second grade, first grade.  Jesus.  It was all show and tell back then.  Thank you.  Let's say hi.  I'll just like, hey, I'll show you mine.  You'll show me yours.  Yeah.  Touching.  That's weird.  I used to get this girl, Julie, to straddle my face because she'd pee her pants. 
[02:50:30]  I could smell it.  Wow.  See, that has nothing to do with the way you were raised.  No.  What happened, Jimmy?  That is just something in his DNA.  What happened, Jimmy?  It's time to tell.  What?  I wish I knew.  Nature or nurture.  You got to admit that something happened, right?  Not necessarily.  Because you did things that the average kid never did.  I think he just likes it.  There were other kids in my neighborhood doing it.  I mean, look, you know, a bunch of little friends get together. 
[02:51:00]  Everybody blows each other and laughs.  That's the way it is.  A little laugh.  Just chuckles.  Yeah.  Wait, you used to look...  Oh, okay.  We got some great stories, but you know what?  We got to do this justice, so we're going to take a break.  Kurt and PA, Chris the Trucker, stay there.  We're going to you guys next.  Don't go anywhere.  Don't go anywhere.  And thanks, Arianna and Gabe.  They're not leaving, are they?  No, but you know.  What the fuck was that?  Who was that?  Was that you?  No. 
[02:51:30]  Jimmy.  Why are you so scared?  I'm afraid I'm not going to see Black Sabbath.  Because that wasn't even near...  Did you put the mic near your ass?  No.  Wow.  You know what happens sometimes?  When I get negative thoughts, positivity comes in and squishes all the negative thoughts  out of me.  So that's what we heard, negative thoughts?  Those were all negative thoughts.  Grumbling.  I'm negative.  Oh, boy. 
[02:52:00]  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this. 
[02:52:30]  You want to taste this?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wow.  That's really nice.  Let's throw it against the wall.  Come on.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  We got to go to the phones here.  I think we started something.  Let's go with Leanne.  Leanne, what's up?  Nothing.  What are you doing?  Talking to you.  Radio show.  Good deal.  Listen, y'all say you have no female fans.  I'm one.  I love you guys.  You know what's weird?  Thank you.  I got to tell you, on the way over to XM today, Ant and I were talking in the streets  there doing the walk, and I said to Ant, man, have you noticed there's a lot of women 
[02:53:30]  calling the show and listening for the show?  Yeah, a lot of female fans.  I like that.  Yeah, you know.  We're noticing.  Yeah, I think it's like it's cool for a girl to be able to hear a guy's perspective  because it's just like y'all are just sitting around bullshitting, and there's no...  Anyway.  Yeah, I'm not a good story.  What?  You don't like holes on the radio, right?  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  Unless they're getting fisted or something.  I'm so sexy.  Oh, it makes me want to barf.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Cool.  All right, Leanne.  You saw balls at 10 years old?  Oh, my God.  We were campaigning. 
[02:54:00]  And my best friend's dad was running for property assessor, and so we were walking  around the neighborhood.  And they're in Butcher's Holler?  And Coal Miner's daughter?  Yeah, basically.  It's pretty bad.  All right, Leanne, you're going to have to talk a little slower because we're not used  to the Tennessee accent around here.  I like it.  Sorry.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Something about campaigning with Dad or Dad's sister?  Well, I was actually with a friend of mine, another guy that was my age.  Okay.  And we were walking around the neighborhood.  Well, we walked up to this guy. 
[02:54:30]  I was sitting on the front porch with his legs spread wide open.  Didn't think a thing about it.  I walked up to him and, you know, gave him my little spiel, you know, vote for this guy.  And his balls were hanging out.  He had on, like, these parachute shorts, and they were real loose.  And I was mesmerized.  I could not take my eyes off of him.  And I actually stood there so long that my friend hit me and said, come on, let's go.  And I know he had to know what I was flipping out over.  You were just staring at his sack?  Yeah, because sometimes guys will sit in shorts, and their fucking bag is just hanging out of the leg of their shorts. 
[02:55:00]  You've got to think that guy knew his bag was hanging out, though.  He was probably a creep.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He knew his bag was hanging out.  He had to have known.  I just like those words.  Yeah.  His bag was hanging out.  And he knew it.  And what do you remember, like, thinking when you first saw that at the tender age of 10?  I was like, what the hell is that nasty shit?  Because I had a little brother.  And, you know, he was, like, two.  You know, so he's real little and smooth.  And, you know, when I'd help mom change his diaper, nothing weird about that. 
[02:55:30]  And they were so hairy and dark and, like, hanging down.  And, oh, my God, I just, you know, never seen anything.  How long before they were from being disgusted to laying on your nose?  Not soon enough for him.  I don't think it was an accident because I was a cute little blonde.  And I think he knew exactly what he was doing.  Do you like balls now?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, big ball fan.  Absolutely.  She's a big ball fan. 
[02:56:00]  That's nice.  I don't think women like balls.  Well, if you take care of balls, you get taken care of.  Yeah, the whole package.  An adult story of why I was seeing a bag hang out.  Years ago, I was going into, and I don't think I even knew guys cruise each other in rest areas at this point.  I just wasn't aware that it happened.  I was walking.  This was outside.  I was walking up the Burger King steps, and there was a guy sitting out there, 
[02:56:30]  kind of like you're sitting on the railing in a pair of shorts,  and his fucking leg was open, and his fucking bag and fucking maybe one and a half inch dick was sticking out.  It was awful.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  And I knew what he was.  I mean, I'm not an idiot.  I was an adult.  I knew he was fucking doing something, you know, faggy.  But I'm like, yeah.  Dude, you're on the steps of a fucking, like you're on the railing at a fast food place.  Have some pride.  Yeah, right? 
[02:57:00]  Pick up a teen-year-old.  It was like, how could anybody, even if you're going to go blow someone, how do you find that sexy?  A guy smoking with his fucking shorts and his legs sitting.  It was horrendous.  And you know how he posed himself like that.  Of course he did.  Like, he had to get there and then pull his cock to the side, get it sticking out that leg.  Was he trying to have an out in case a cop or somebody walked over?  I actually don't know.  And he goes, oh, jeez, I didn't know.  Oh, officer, I'm sorry my dick was hanging out.  I didn't, uh.  Hairy sack.  I didn't, like, fucking, you know, make an issue out of it. 
[02:57:30]  But, you know, you're walking up the steps, you can't not see it.  Right.  Top railing, guys.  What were the people saying or doing?  It was dark.  It was night.  I was coming home from a gate.  It was nothing like, you know, it wasn't like there was 500 people out there.  It wasn't New Year's Eve in Times Square.  It wasn't sitting in front of Dick Clark's window.  It was fucking back.  Well, Leanne, that's a great story.  Yeah, good one.  Thanks.  Love you, guys.  We love you.  We love you.  No, we love you.  We love the accent.  All right, let's go to Bob in Delaware.  Bob, what's up? 
[02:58:00]  Hey, Bob.  I had a, uh, nine years old, I had a 12-year-old girlfriend.  We used to get naked in her basement every day after school.  She was fully developed.  It was the first time I ever got jerked off.  It was awesome.  Wait.  Wow.  She was fully developed at 12?  At nine years old.  Yeah, but at nine years old, I didn't ejaculate.  I didn't have anything.  You're right.  You know what I mean?  You don't, you don't, you just get the feeling and you're like, whoa, and you shake.  But she was, oh, unbelievable.  Dude, when I was climbing the ropes in gym class, that, I think, was the best feeling ever. 
[02:58:30]  And it was way before.  Were you humping it?  No, man.  You're just climbing the rope.  You got your legs tight around the bottom of the rope and you're just sliding your penis  up the rope.  You didn't know why?  Sliding your dick up rope.  How does that feel good?  That sounds awful.  You got your shorts on and stuff with the feeling, I remember.  No, the guy just brought up a memory.  It's like, that feeling was the most unbelievable feeling ever.  And that was way before, you know, I hit puberty. 
[02:59:00]  I wonder if there's something to that.  Yeah, it's just a nice feeling.  Like, in therapy, we discuss certain things.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Because I can remember smelling someone's shit outdoors.  Like, hiding behind a pile and smelling the shit they had taken.  What the fuck, Jimmy?  I swear to God, I had that weird memory come back.  Let me just dwell on that for a second.  Bob, hold on.  We might go back to you because, you know, 12-year-old fully developed.  There's something there that we got to explore.  But go ahead, Jimmy.  The shit, do you know whose shit it was? 
[02:59:30]  No, I have no memory of it.  But it was human shit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was fresh.  But I remember just being, but it wasn't as sexual.  It wasn't like, oh.  It was just like, it was just, it smelled like, it was weird.  And she goes, that's perfectly normal.  Like, little kids are fascinated by shit.  No, it's not.  You're a fucking weirdo.  Yeah, how do you know it was human shit?  I don't know how I know.  I only remember being, I want to say it was, I don't know why I'm thinking it was in the  woods because I'm picturing it being in this old fucking building, like this abandoned building 
[03:00:00]  where I saw my first pornographic picture, which is on Route 1 in Edison, New Jersey.  And I somehow think it's in there.  I don't have any memory leading up to it or right after it.  I just remember that.  I don't know why I remember that.  Smelling someone's shit.  Yeah.  And did it make you feel good?  I don't know.  No.  Were you enjoying it in some way?  I don't.  Not sexually, but just something like.  I don't know.  You drive by a steakhouse and you go, ooh, that little fleeting smell of a steak on the 
[03:00:30]  broiler.  No, I don't think it was like that.  I don't know.  It was like an animal thing.  It's like, I don't know what would have drawn me to do that or what I felt about it.  It wasn't like it was wonderful.  I didn't want to eat it.  I am really glad to hear that.  You and me both.  But now you pay for that type of thing.  Well, I haven't for a long time.  Dig in.  No, I haven't.  No, a good one.  Are you blocking something, Jimmy, and you're scared to find out what it is? 
[03:01:00]  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I mean, I'm pretty open to suggestions.  I mean, as long as I know I didn't fuck my parents, which I know that didn't happen.  So, whatever.  Thing, huh?  Yeah.  There was somebody that snuck in there when I was a youngster.  I'll live with it.  Yeah, there are things you remember as like a kid, like the first memory you have, but  then there's all these blank moments and you wonder, oh, what happened in there?  It's like, do I even want to know?  Fill in some of these blanks or just leave them best left alone? 
[03:01:30]  I want to know why I had this fucking thing with violence and then love.  Yeah, that's weird.  Yeah.  That is an odd little not everyone's got that thing.  And I didn't see it growing up.  I mean, I talked to my mom yesterday.  She's like, no.  I mean, I believe her.  I mean, they were pretty normal people.  I mean, it's just...  I mean, his parents are beyond normal.  Yeah.  My dad quit drinking when I was like two.  So, I mean, it was like I grew up in a very non-drinking household and shit.  Yeah.  Not for two years.  Yeah.  God knows what happened then. 
[03:02:00]  Could have been a feisty two years.  Oopsie.  That's 730 days.  Dropped on your head a few times.  It's a long time, Jimmy.  No, she said that my dad never...  She would have told me.  I think she would have told me or he would have told me, but no.  All right.  I wonder, did I see somebody...  Because I have a thing with being thrown down the stairs.  I'm like, why did I see that?  Somebody got thrown down the stairs.  Maybe someone got thrown down the stairs.  Yeah, you saw that as a kid.  Yeah, but my friend's father was a violent drunk, so maybe that was it.  All right.  Listen, I'm getting beat up, but there's a couple of guys that understand exactly what  I'm trying to say.  Matt in North Carolina. 
[03:02:30]  Matt.  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, man.  What you were talking about, climbing the rope in gym, I have a similar experience.  You get the same thing climbing a pole.  When I was a kid, same thing climbing a pole.  And it's a lot easier than a rope, too, on your dick.  I don't know.  I was in gym class, climbing the rope was always...  I was concentrating too much on fucking climbing the rope.  So was I.  It was a major distraction.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Big, stupid knot at the bottom. 
[03:03:00]  Gym teacher's holding, looking up your pant leg.  You fly easier on a metal pole, too.  Like, sweatpants or something, or jeans.  You just fly right up, and it's a lot easier.  And it was a great feeling, right?  Like, even...  Oh, yeah.  It's one of the best feelings I ever remember.  Oh, yeah.  All right, thanks.  That was before you really knew anything, but yeah, that was cool.  There was a time in, I guess, elementary school.  At some point, they decided that we were going to do square dancing for gym. 
[03:03:30]  And that's when I totally knew, like, I was into girls.  Heterosexual.  Oh, my God.  That was, like, the most unbelievable feeling ever.  Like, before that, you'd do, like, things in the backyard with, you know, you show me  yours, I'll show you mine, with the girls and stuff like that.  But that was when they opened up the accordion doors to the two separate parts of the gym,  the girls' gym and the boys' gym.  So now it was just big.  And they'd play the stupid square dance music, and you'd pair off with partners.  And it was the first time you really, like, you were holding hands and putting your arm 
[03:04:00]  around a girl's waist and doing, like, square dance moves.  Remember, your heart was just like, oh, dude, it was fucking sex.  They didn't even understand.  Like, the teachers, that was fucking sex.  My hands were so clammy.  And the only thing that, like, saved me was the girls' hands were the same fucking way.  It was sex for kids.  They were, like, you were doing things.  You were, you know, when you do that thing where you put your arm around the girl, I  guess it's promenade.  Promenade!  And you'd put it around her waist and hold her hand in front of you and kind of, like, 
[03:04:30]  walk a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  And you're holding, like, her hip a little bit.  And it was fucking so sexual.  I remember you would count out the girls to see who you got.  And then you would see right around the point where it should be your girl.  They're switching places like crazy.  Like, oh, great.  Switch, switch, girl.  They're switching like crazy.  Give me your spot.  Give me your spot.  And then you count.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Okay, eight, eight.  I'm here.  Move.  Get the fuck over.  Move.  But then she would switch. 
[03:05:00]  Then you would have to switch back.  Switch back.  And then you'd...  But square dancing was kind of weird because then you'd lose your partner for a minute  when you go, you know, and change partners.  And then do a little do-si-do.  And then you're back with the other one.  So...  But it was the equivalent of sex.  At that age...  You'd get...  Dude, I would get so fucking worked up  that I was almost hyperventilating  just by touching...  Because it's the first time you really had physical contact with a girl like that. 
[03:05:30]  Let's say hi to John in Tennessee.  John, what's up?  Hey, yo.  I know the same thing.  And like the other caller, I used to do it with a pole.  And I remember the day it hit me, I was like, holy shit, I've been jacking off for all this time.  It's just a unbelievable feeling.  But I'm saying before you reach puberty, though.  Right.  It seemed like the feeling was different.  But it's... 
[03:06:00]  Trust me, I'm not complaining about the feeling now, but it just seemed...  My memory, maybe it was because it was the first time it felt that.  I don't know.  It was like, holy crap, what is this?  All right.  I agree.  Hey, can we have a travel environment in Nashville?  Oh, wow.  Nashville, Tennessee.  God, we want to get down there, too.  That might have to wait until next year.  We've got to keep building the audience.  So we're pushing about 10 dates this year.  So the best for you is, I guess, Vegas, right?  Anywhere else close to Nashville that we're going? 
[03:06:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  I've got to look at the final list.  All right, bro.  I'm sorry.  I don't think we're going to make Nashville this year.  I appreciate it, fellas.  All right, man.  Punch it out.  Let's go to Sean in New York City.  Sean, what's up?  How you doing, man?  Hey.  I was down...  When I was nine years old, I was down in the village in McDonald's online.  And two flamboyant, like, porn star-looking girls come in.  And I'm with my sister ordering a Happy Meal.  Next thing you know, the girl lifts up her skirt, and she's got cock and balls hanging out.  How old were you? 
[03:07:00]  I was nine years old.  I'll never forget some of my whole life.  I got two girls.  I'm staring at these two hot porn star girls.  I'm like, wow, these girls are crazy.  Next thing you know, the one girl lifts up her skirt, and nothing but cock and balls.  I'm in total, total awe.  I'm sitting there like, holy shit.  Right.  What the hell is that, man?  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I'm in total awe.  Forget the feeling.  It's a life changer, isn't it?  All right, Sean, thanks.  That's fucking great, man.  Good story there.  Let's say hi to Kurt in Pennsylvania. 
[03:07:30]  Kurt, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Jimmy, you're brilliant.  Little Jimmy not there.  Thank you, man.  Anyway, that guy has a story.  Everybody has a story.  I was, like, I think three or four years old, and I walked into my mom in the bathroom,  and she was standing up, wiping herself with that fucking tarantula, that hairy mat.  And I remember every detail of that, like, four years old.  I'm 45 now, man.  So he's got a story.  I know.  It doesn't. 
[03:08:00]  That shit just ingrains itself in your head.  I was going to say, isn't that weird?  Some other memories from that exact year you'll never remember ever, ever, ever again.  I remember my mom basting the turkey on that Thanksgiving day, and she put the turkey in,  and I guess, I don't know, maybe she was hungover or something, so she went back to bed,  but she had to keep coming out and basting the turkey.  So she was just wearing, like, her nightgown thing, and it had, like, these bloomer panties  to them, but it was too short.  It was almost like some kind of lingerie thing she was wearing, and it was semi-see-through. 
[03:08:30]  So, like, I walked into...  Shut up, Jimmy.  I walk into the kitchen, and she's bent over the stove, basting the turkey, and all  I see is my mom's ass, like, through these, like, sheer lingerie thing.  Yes.  I was like, oh, goddammit.  And, yeah, that fucking image is just stuck in my head.  Mine, too, now.  Ah, shut up.  Your mom is honestly a very, very beautiful woman.  Leave my mom out of this. 
[03:09:00]  With all due respect, she's a very...  I had to just...  It was, you know...  It was my mom's ass.  I didn't want to see it.  It's through the little lingerie.  I'm getting beat up by Hugh's Lad Bag.  Based in the turkey.  Hugh's Lad Bag.  Hugh's Lad.  It's not his real name.  Opie, Las Vegas is close to Nashville.  I just did a map quest.  It's...  Well, let's just round it off.  1,800 miles away.  1,800.  But here's what I was trying to get at. 
[03:09:30]  I still think it's the closest, closest venue.  To, uh, what?  As far as...  To Nashville.  If you're in Nashville, I think if you want to see the only traveling virus this summer,  your closest...  Oh, oh, would be...  It's still Vegas.  Vegas.  1,800 miles.  I gotta see a map now.  No, New York's closer.  You think?  We're not doing New York.  We're doing all our Saskatchewan and Alaska.  If it's 1,800 miles...  All right, use Lad Bag.  And the U.S. is 3,000 miles.  All right, some of the cities are very obvious. 
[03:10:00]  We're doing, uh, New York, Boston, Philly, Washington.  Maybe, uh, Florida, I think.  Chicago.  Chicago.  Chicago.  And maybe Detroit.  Chicago.  We might go to Detroit.  And we're doing something in the Buffalo area, which I think we should do.  And we're doing, yeah, Detroit, because we have three different stations up in that  triangular...  Triangulation?  A crossfire!  Do you know, I remember my first, I think, I had a very bad experience.  I have weird issues with the pussy.  Do you?  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  And, uh...  Ah!  Ah!  I remember being a boy with my friend Tony.  We were sitting at the pool, and, uh...  That's right, yeah.  I was looking between this girl.  This woman's lady.  She was an older woman.  DC is closest.  And I could see...  Of course.  Sorry.  And I could see her pussy bulging and her hair sticking out.  I was maybe five.  Oh!  And she was wearing a bikini.  She was like...  She was dating the superintendent.  And, um...  I remember I said to Tony...  West Palm's closer.  Look, I can see hairs.  I can see hairs.  Yeah.  And she goes, what did you just say? 
[03:11:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh, nothing.  Jimmy's in trouble.  Nothing?  And fucking Tony goes, he said he could see hairs.  Little rat?  He ratted me out, and she screams at me, you little fucking pig!  I'll never forget that.  He said, well, I can, you fucking whore!  Tuck him in!  Yeah, maybe 17 years later I would have said that.  But instead I ran ashamed out of the pool.  Oh, poor little Jimmy just running away from the pussy.  Yeah, fast forward X amount of years, and it's, uh... 
[03:11:30]  I know you're a legitimate masseuse, but would you mind tugging on this for an extra hundred?  I have a very similar experience to that.  I was going over, um, a party.  My brother was, you know, my big brother, and he invited me over to this pool party, and it was like a big deal for me.  Big brother invited me.  Holy shit, that's pretty cool.  And it was all, like, people his age, and, uh, I guess at the time I was probably, eh, 10 or 11, and he was 13, something like that.  So the girls were all laying out by the pool, and one was wearing what was like a crocheted bikini. 
[03:12:00]  And you could see, like, her mound, her pubic mound through it.  And through the crocheting were fucking hairs just poking through, all through, and then coming out the sides a little bit, you know?  And I couldn't stop staring.  I got, where, where my brother gave me one of those fucking Moe Howard to Shemp fucking smacks on the head.  Like, what are you doing? 
[03:12:30]  And smack, and was like, you know.  Because you're going to ruin it for everyone else.  Yeah, you're going to ruin it.  Because I was just standing there with my big fucking silver dollar eyes just, and mouth agape, just staring at this.  Right.  Did you cry?  Fascinated.  Yeah, I was just like, please, I want to keep looking.  Can I, can I just throw myself under the bus?  Sweetie, why?  Oh, Detroit is closer to Nashville by a little over 100 miles.  Adam from Columbus.  Every city you just mentioned is closer to Nashville than Vegas. 
[03:13:00]  Every city.  No, it's not actually, because you were talking about every city.  Jim from New Brunswick.  Nashville is 880 miles from New York City there, Copernicus.  It's just ugly.  I did a map quest from Nashville to Philly, 825 miles, about 1,000 fewer miles.  Just 1,000 miles.  From St. Louis.  Obviously, Beijing is going to be on the list, right, Ope?  You fucking rope-hunting retard.  It's not pretty.  Rope-hunting or rope-humping? 
[03:13:30]  Rope-humping.  Okay.  And then, Fast Freddy, I'm in New York.  Rope-hunting is kind of funny.  You're just looking for a rope to fuck.  It felt so good to have your cock on it.  Where's a rope?  Fast Freddy from New York.  I'm in New York.  Any chance you'll be doing a show in Alabama, I could catch.  So...  Yeah, they kind of gang up on you.  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Well, we've got some great stories coming in.  We've got Lindsay from Westchester.  Let's see what...  From Westchester. 
[03:14:00]  Westchester.  Lindsay, what's up?  Hey, I'm just calling to share with you guys that the same thing happens to girls when  they're climbing the rope in gym, when they're prepubescent as well.  Oh, yeah?  You get that same unbelievable feeling?  Yeah, it's like, and you're wondering if the other girls are doing it.  You're, like, trying to check their faces when they're climbing up the rope.  It's funny.  And the same thing on polls...  Check their faces.  And the fucking gym teachers knew the whole time.  How could they not?  Yeah.  Of course they did.  Sick bastards.  Yeah, there was a slug trail on the rope.  It looks like the rope in Poltergeist when they threw it through. 
[03:14:30]  A bunch of watches come falling out.  Slimy.  Why did you have to climb the rope in gym class?  Athletics is dangerous, too.  All right, Lindsay.  You think that fucking one-inch mat they put at the bottom is going to help when you fall  40 fucking feet from a gymnasium ceiling?  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll help.  All right, we got Fiddy.  Fiddy, what up?  No safety fucking harness.  Nothing.  They just sent you up there.  Opie, man.  I got one memory that comes before the ropes, man. 
[03:15:00]  But when you're driving down the freeway, you know, I remember being like five or six,  and you hit that dip in the highway, and oh, and everybody would go, oh, my tummy.  You know, bull, man.  That was, it wasn't my tummy that was tickling, man.  Yeah, if you get into a big whoop-dee-doo in a car when you're going fast, and your stomach  kind of drops down, it's that feeling in your lower abdomen.  Yeah.  You would get...  Oh, yeah.  That was kind of weird.  It would make your fucking, like, your dick and balls tingle.  Yeah, that was a good feeling, actually.  Oh, man. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, sometimes it would last for a good mile, you know, and I'm thinking shit.  A good mile.  A good mile.  Do it again.  I've talked about this before.  I used to get a fucking rod on the bus every day.  Every day.  And it wasn't a sexual thing.  It wasn't looking at a girl.  It wasn't something...  So does Jeffrey, obviously.  Hello, call back.  We've left you alone for a half hour.  It was just this pre-conditioned thing.  I don't know why, but I would get on the bus, wouldn't have a fucking rod, and I'd sit  down, the bus would start moving, and I'd just start getting a fucking rod. 
[03:16:00]  The rumble of the bus against your ball, but it had...  No, no, because it wasn't anything that felt good.  It wasn't, like, a feeling.  It wasn't a physical feeling.  It was something mental about being on that fucking bus that I got a goddamn boner.  Did you feel like you were doing something kind of adult?  No.  You know, at that age, like, you're responsible, and it's like, you're going into the unknown.  It's just a fucking kid, and then I'd have to get off the bus with the books in front  of my dick.  But it was something psychological.  Maybe it's that fucking pheromone thing.  No, it's because Anthony was scared.  Maybe it's the pheromones that are just floating around in the air. 
[03:16:30]  And his penis was acting like a little periscope, just checking for danger.  Looking around for danger.  Going to-  You're on the bus, up periscope.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  There's a great one.  Send out a single ping.  Well, Nashville's only 472 miles from Chicago, so thanks.  All right.  I get it.  I close think.  Jason in Illinois, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  What's going on this morning?  Hey.  When I was about 10, I didn't hear you say that. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, boy.  I heard babysitter tell you.  Babysitter.  Fucking mouth.  Suck dick.  Whore.  Hand.  What happened?  She wanted-  I was about 10, and this was the first boobs and anything I'd ever seen, and she wanted  to put me in the positions that were in the book.  She said to me, she says-  Oh, the joy of sex.  She was in the joy of sex book, and apparently it was my parents' book, and to me, it wasn't 
[03:17:30]  sexual or anything.  You know, I just remember looking back at it.  I got the memory again when I was about 16, and I remember, because I'd seen a picture  of her in one of our photo albums, and I kind of remembered, holy shit, that happened.  Because back then, I didn't really know what it was.  You know, I think we lost the best part of the story, so the babysitter decided to show  you the joy of sex book?  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  That's pretty hot.  I remember putting my-  I put my mouth on her tit, and she wanted me to suck like a lollipop.  Just grandmother.  I remember sucking on her tit, and I remember putting my hand down on her-  on her vag, and feeling the hair, and I remember it feeling like my-  I had a black friend that lived next door.  His name was George.  I remember-  Like his dick hair?  No, when he'd go to work, this guy would eat Louise. 
[03:18:30]  But yeah, that was my first experience.  It was quite interesting.  It felt like Negro hair.  So his phone was cutting out, so he sucked cock at what age?  Nah, he had a dick up his ass.  Dude, what?  He's talking about George.  I have no response to that.  Oh, George did what to you?  George the black guy.  Yeah.  George was my black friend that lived next door.  Yeah.  And all I can remember at the time was her- 
[03:19:00]  She put my hand down her pants, and it felt like his hair.  Okay.  What he's saying is, he would yawn, and George would go over and do push-ups over his face.  George.  George.  George the Negro boy.  The young Negro boy, George.  Well, he was curious.  With the ashy knees.  Thanks, boys.  I'm fucking out.  Yeah, no problem.  That Joy of Sex book was fucking hysterical as a kid, though, because a few of my friend's  parents had that one, the real stuffed shirt parents, and when we'd go rummaging through 
[03:19:30]  their rooms, we'd find the Joy of Sex, and it was drawings of a couple having different  sexual positions, and stories that went along with it of how to do these positions, but they  were just like drawings.  Right, right.  But it was kind of hard to look at, but I remember the drawing of the girl was just  this big thatch of fucking fuzz.  They couldn't even draw her with a nice pussy.  Big huge triangle.  It was just a big fucking muff drawn in there.  Guy must have gone through a whole pencil just drawing her fucking pubes. 
[03:20:00]  Drawing unclipped cock.  You guys want to continue with this?  Yeah, why not?  There seems to be a lot of phone calls coming in.  Marilyn, ex, uh...  All right, let's do this.  Marilyn.  Hey, Marilyn.  Hey, guys.  Someone had a great line about it, and I can't find it on the instant feedback.  They want to know if you were wearing that Italian Speedo of yours while you were on  the bus or something.  I think it was on line two.  I can't find it.  Yeah, it's on the phone. 
[03:20:30]  It was on the phone.  That's why I can't find it.  I'm looking at the wrong screen.  Max in Dallas, go ahead.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  I was just wondering if you were wearing your striped Speedo bikini bottoms when you  were checking out the chick in a crocheted bikini, eh?  No, I had regular shorts on.  I had cut-offs on.  We used to go to the...  Big...  We used to go to...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, I had nothing.  Go ahead, Max.  I was going to say, we used to go to the deep end of the swimming pool when we were 13 
[03:21:00]  years old, me and my best friend, with our diving masks and our snorkels, and wait  for the hot chicks in the bikinis to dive into the pool, and their bikini bottoms would  come off.  Dude, that was the greatest scam going.  I remember doing that, too.  I haven't thought about that in years.  Where the tops would come down.  You would wait at the deep end, right around the diving pool, and just go under when they  were ready to jump off.  And of course, they're wearing bikinis for the most part, and obviously something gets  thrown around.  Top or the bottom gets pulled down.  And they'd go with the quick, trying to get themselves back together, but you would see 
[03:21:30]  all sorts of crap underneath the water.  Oh, yeah.  The only problem was, one of my friends was a black dude, and I'd be there with a little  pup tent going, and he'd have a goddamn circus tent.  Bono!  Bono, he ended his call.  The first time I played with myself, I didn't know what coming was, and I felt the urge,  and so I'm such a dork.  I just stopped jerking, and ran to the bathroom, and stood over the toilet, and pointed my  dick down. 
[03:22:00]  And wrecked it, of course.  Nothing came out.  You wrecked it.  Yeah, of course I did.  Stupid I was.  I thought it was like piss, and I could hold it a minute.  Oh, you could hold it, and then just let it go?  I pointed it down.  You didn't continue after you realized?  No.  Later that night, I did.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  And then you hit the jackpot?  It was...  Just started a lifetime of...  God almighty.  Let's go to Maryland.  Did you scare yourself?  Changed my life.  In a very bad way.  It scared me at first.  Because I didn't know what was going to happen.  I just knew it was feeling better and better the faster I went. 
[03:22:30]  And then the second it actually hit pay dirt, I was like, ah, what's happening?  I thought I broke something.  I felt like Carrie in the shower when she got her period.  Marilyn, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I have a story that Uncle Paul would love.  About a year and a half ago, I dated a guy named Jeff, and he was completely in love with  his cousin.  And he used to tell me about when they were...  He was six and she was...  No, he was seven and she was six. 
[03:23:00]  And they used to get caught playing doctor all the time.  And he said one day that he remembers his cousin came over and his mom was babysitting him.  And she told him to go into his room and play.  And they were sitting on the floor and they were playing with those really miniature matchbox  cars.  And he got this idea in his head.  And before he knew it, she was laying back with her legs spread.  And he went to go put it in...  Put the matchbox car inside of her and he, like, pushed it.  And she went, ooh, not too far, you'll make it stink. 
[03:23:30]  Jesus Christ.  Seriously.  He used to tell me all the time about how he would masturbate to the image that he got  when he was 16.  His cousin was 15.  And she was climbing out of a pool with a bikini on.  And I guess it had...  The bottom part had shifted.  And he could see one of her lips.  And he just...  He went crazy. 
[03:24:00]  How long did he go out with this guy?  I went out with him for three months.  I actually broke up with him because he told me a story that just disturbed me to my very  core.  What was it?  Oh, what was it?  Now, disturb us, please.  Oh, okay.  Well, last week...  It was actually kind of funny.  I was going to call him last week.  You had a story about a woman who found her dead dog's head in the box.  Yeah.  When he was four years old, his mom owned the house next door.  And he was drunk telling me about this. 
[03:24:30]  But his mom owned the house next door.  However, she rented it out to a woman and her son, who was eight.  So he was four.  His friend next door was eight.  And his friend used to come over and would literally take him back to his house, into  the basement, and threaten him with a razor blade.  And, you know, would just actually cut him all the time.  And he would threaten to make him a woman.  So it really messed with his psychological, you know, makeup and everything.  And this went on for two years.  His mom didn't do anything about it because she needed the rent money. 
[03:25:00]  Maybe she wanted a daughter.  And his mom...  Huh?  Go ahead.  Nothing.  I'm sorry.  But his mom knew about it.  She didn't do anything.  And this went on for two years.  And then one Christmas, his neighbor got a puppy.  It was like a little black lab puppy for Christmas.  And that night, well, that night, you know, his friend was playing with the puppy.  And Jeff went over to play with it. 
[03:25:30]  And his friend next door said, no, no, you can't play with my puppy.  It's mine.  So he started to hate the dog, you know, because his friend liked the dog more than him.  So this went on for two weeks.  Like your story.  And at the end of two weeks...  I'm sorry?  No, go ahead.  I said like your story.  And at the end of two weeks, he climbed out of his bedroom window, went across the lawn  to his neighbor's window, and opened his window and had a piece of hot dog. 
[03:26:00]  And he beckoned the puppy over to the window sill.  And he picked up the puppy, took him back to his house, and played with him for like two  hours.  He's old.  No?  He played with him for two hours, loved on him, and then basically took a butcher knife  to the puppy's head.  Took him back across the lawn to his neighbor's house, and arranged him on the pillow so that  when the boy would wake up in the morning, he would roll over and see him. 
[03:26:30]  How quiet a mover was he?  He fucking...  He committed an Alzeri Kelly beheading, and they brought him back.  What was this fucking kid on?  Ambien?  How did he not wake up?  I have no idea, but he actually showed me the newspaper clipping of it.  Did he wake up and then decide to give Johnny Fontaine a part in a picture?  No, he actually showed me the newspaper clipping of it.  The boy and his mom moved like two days after that.  That's sad.  But he never said anything. 
[03:27:00]  His neighbor never said anything.  And his mom never said anything.  But his mom knew.  And then what happened?  I yelled frunkus and hung up.  What?  She goes, I yelled frunkus and hung up.  Oh, okay.  She knows the gag.  I don't like puppies being injured.  No.  At all.  No.  I don't like fucking stories that take forever.  Yeah.  That story could have been wrapped up in a minute.  Like a puppy skull.  Yeah, like a little puppy skull. 
[03:27:30]  I guess we got a break then.  Now we got a break because she told a story that...  Guys, we're going to learn about techno-sexuals next.  What?  I don't know.  The hell is that?  I just got a big thumbs up from the boys, so...  I want to just mention as we're going to break that I'll be in Rhode Island tomorrow.  Tomorrow in Boston for the weekend.  I forgot to mention it before.  Rhode Island.  Comedy Connection.  Where in Rhode Island?  I don't know.  Providence.  So...  Oh.  Well, at least that narrows it down to the biggest city.  Come on down.  I'll smell your logs if you drop on the floor. 
[03:28:00]  I'm an asshole child that I had.  Fucking little dirtbag.  There we go.  Use the public airwaves to promote and profit from the sale of pornographic material.  We're smut peddlers, like Anthony said.  Me and Opie, we're counting up the filthy pornographic money.  You owe us for the porn we gave you.  Mwahaha.  I love porno money. 
[03:28:30]  Ladies and germs.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony program.  Ladies and germs.  That's funny.  Instead of gentlemen, you said germ.  Right, and instead of cunts, I said ladies.  I just got a big shipment of the Taboo 1 through 6 and a couple of other Curtis Stevens classics.  So thank you to the porn guys from Addictive Entertainment.  They know what you like.  Fucking A. Incest.  That won't end up on the desk in the office. 
[03:29:00]  No, this came right to fucking me.  Where's Opie?  He's coming.  And I see you got your copy of Hustler.  Yeah, just to look at the cartoons.  Hustler cartoons are hilarious.  I think that's why Hustler's still doing well.  The best pornographic magazine.  They got to give you something you can't just get online.  Like online, you can get any fucking type of porno you want.  But Hustler's like funny.  They got the worst, like most racist fucking cartoons in there.  And their commentary's good.  Hysterical. 
[03:29:30]  And of course, you know, they got chicks taking it up the ass.  They got some great pictures.  What are you laughing at, Jimmy?  This is just a funny one.  This is, we have a situation.  This is where obviously, like when Ford died.  President Ford has just fallen out of his casket.  And this guy, you can see, it looks like he tripped out of his casket.  This is just funny.  This guy, Billet, Jay Billet, is really brilliant.  And, yeah, Hustler's a good one.  I remember a friend of mine had, he was like my best friend, way back in the olden days. 
[03:30:00]  Richard?  No.  Well before Richard.  And he had a scratch and sniff Hustler.  Oh, I remember those.  Yeah.  And you scratch the vag and it was supposed to smell like vag.  It smelled like roadkill.  It was before I had ever had sex or anything or anything like that.  It was, I think, you know, nine or ten or something like that.  And I wouldn't smell it.  Because I was horrified at what it was going to smell like. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, that shit was scary back then.  I want to smell the scratch and sniff vag.  All right, you want to learn about techno-sexuals?  Yeah, what is that?  I don't know.  All right, next topic.  Technosexual.  Well, why don't we listen?  Is it that important for a guy to have a stylish vacuum cleaner?  It's just more of a lifestyle.  It is, apparently, if you're a techno-sexual.  The new ideal male. 
[03:31:00]  A what?  Techno-sexual.  Yeah, we'll go to Bang & Olsen.  Meet Ricky Montalvo, techno-sexual.  He's the new chic.  And Ricky will help you get chic from your coffee pot.  It's not flashy.  It's kind of old school.  To your stereo system.  It's called the butterfly.  Ricky leads a team of Silicon Valley tech workers who started the techno-sexual movement.  They say it's about style, culture, and, of course, lots of technology.  You know, back in the day, you know, a woman wanted a guy who could change the oil, rake  the leaves, and clean out the rain gutters. 
[03:31:30]  You know, we're saying the new ideal male is a guy who can set up her wireless DSL router  configuration at her home.  That's a techno-sexual?  That's...  Why are we listening to this?  Who...  Who...  Who...  Who brought this?  Who thumbs up this?  First of all, the sound quality sounded like it was coming over Biggs Radio as he was going  into the Death Star.  What the hell was that underwater sound we were getting?  Looks like the guys need a little lesson in being techno-sexual.  Techno-sexual? 
[03:32:00]  That's...  Who brought this in and why?  That wasn't...  It's...  First of all, it's...  It had something to do with, like, having sex with robots or something.  First of all, it's an awful term.  It's just people that are into tech.  It's a...  It's a technophile.  It's a geek.  It's a...  Young Sam.  Nothing to do with, um...  Sam, is this your first swing and a complete miss?  I know.  You've been on the rise lately.  You have really been...  Why is it a miss?  Dropping down four points this week.  It's Sam. 
[03:32:30]  No.  It's, uh...  No.  It's a weird story that could create a lot of, uh, conversation.  Maybe on the...  The Than and Sam show.  No.  Maybe there.  At this point, he's saving all the good stuff for the Than and Sam show.  The good shit's being saved for the Than and Sam show.  And we get the rejects.  And we get fucking techno-sexual stories?  The white baby with the black cock.  They're going to save and talk about it on their show.  Exactly.  Hot babysitter stories they're going to save for themselves.  I hear what's going on now.  We understand now. 
[03:33:00]  You've got your own show to produce.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  It's not even...  Yeah, come on.  Not even close.  We wish we could save some stuff for that show.  Well, here's something you can talk about.  Yeah.  Go off.  It's already kind of nice.  We won't even...  I'll tell you something.  We won't even comment on it to ruin it for you.  You can take the techno-sexual...  Let's see what you guys can do with techno-sexual.  And just roll on it.  Guys can get technology instead of feminine accessories.  The guy, he sounds feminine.  We heard that part of it.  Yeah, he sounds kind of gay and nerdy.  He sounds like kind of an interior decorator kind of guy meets a techno guy. 
[03:33:30]  That sounds funny.  It does?  Yeah.  I think you slipped a jujube.  A little tired today.  No, that's it.  To a sugar.  We need sugar.  No, no, no.  What would you and Sam do with that?  Yeah, I'd love to know.  You know something?  Give him a break.  Give him a segment.  I want to hear what they would do with this subject on the Than and Sam show.  Do we have any intro music? 
[03:34:00]  Any type of...  He's putting his host hat on.  Wow.  You just put your hat on backwards over the top.  All right.  Here we go.  Over the top.  Let's bring him back for music.  We're going to see what you guys can do with techno-sexuals.  Techno-sexual.  Play the clip again.  A little prime time for the boys.  Thanks, Sam.  Hope he'll board up for you here with the clip.  I won't say a word.  We'll wait for Danny because he's punching up some sound here.  I think he's getting our proper intro.  All right.  Great.  Good. 
[03:34:30]  I hope so.  We'll wait for that.  Danny.  It's on you, Danny.  Finding that sound clip is the important thing.  The world needs to let users, too, you know.  Travis trying to help him by massaging his lap.  Stop.  That isn't going to make him work any faster.  Are they working on a show themselves, Danny and Travis?  Yeah.  Something's going on there.  Thumbs up.  All right.  Ready, Danny?  Okay. 
[03:35:00]  Here it is.  All right.  We put this festival on you, bosses.  We let our love.  We lost for one year for you, page.  Are you going to break our walls now?  Are you going to be destroyed?  Where you go to hell?  Welcome to the Fan and Sam Show.  Oh, yeah.  This rare prime time appearance.  During the Open Anthony Show, I'd like to thank them for giving us their time. 
[03:35:30]  We're in weird seats.  Yeah, this is a little bit weird.  Sam, you brought some audio in?  Well, I figured, yeah.  I brought some audio for our show, I guess.  I'm glad you've been holding back from the Open Anthony Show.  Yeah, I tend to do that.  Good.  What's this audio all about, or does it speak for itself?  Well, apparently there's a new trend amongst technophiles.  They like to call themselves technosexuals. 
[03:36:00]  Hmm.  See, it sounds like a metrosexual, which is a heterosexual man who's into fashion.  But it's a technosexual, a heterosexual man who's into...  Technology?  You got it, Dan.  I'm intrigued.  Let's hear the audio.  Is it that important for a guy to have a stylish vacuum cleaner?  It's just more of a lifestyle.  It's not important.  It is, apparently, if you're a technosexual.  The new ideal male. 
[03:36:30]  A what?  Technosexual.  Yeah, we'll go to Bang & Ulfsen.  Meet Ricky Montalvo, technosexual.  Geek is the new chic.  And Ricky will help you get chic from your coffee pot...  It's not flashy.  It's kind of old school.  ...to your stereo system.  It's called the butterfly.  Ricky leads a team of Silicon Valley tech workers who started the technosexual movement.  They say it's about style, culture, and, of course, lots of technology.  You know, back in the day, you know, a woman wanted a guy who could change the oil,  rake the leaves, and clean out the rain gutters. 
[03:37:00]  You know, we're saying the new ideal male is a guy who can set up her wireless DSL router  configuration at her home.  What do you think, Stan?  DSL.  Yeah.  I think it's encouraging for people like myself who have trouble changing tires but can set  up a router.  Yeah.  But I don't see the sexual element.  No.  This guy doesn't seem like a big ladies' man, Sam.  Doesn't sound like he gets a lot of female ass.  And throughout the news clip, he's taking the host around these electronic stores, picking 
[03:37:30]  out gadgets as if any woman would actually be intrigued to come along to a store and  look at a fancy gadget.  Like, it's going to turn her on and she's going to think he's more of a man.  Plus the fact that he sounds queer as shit.  Oh, does he?  Yeah.  Didn't even pick up on that.  No, yeah.  He's got a little bit of a feminine voice to him.  What's his name?  Montalvo?  Is that what it was?  Something like that.  Ricardo Montalvo?  Well, let's hear a little bit more about him.  Let me just hear the second clip. 
[03:38:00]  Now.  And now.  Oh, man.  The button seems to be sticking.  That's a little gummy.  All right.  I'm good.  You're being sabotaged, Sam.  But can a cell phone or a television set really impress that special someone in our lives?  And what about cost?  An iPod, a moving TV, all those speakers?  This to me is like the new Ghetto Blaster.  It sounds expensive to be a technosexual. 
[03:38:30]  You know, guys don't have accessories like purses and jewelry and they don't have to spend money on makeup.  So why not spend it on cell phones and, you know, cool messenger bags and sunglasses and cool watches?  Ricky started the movement just five months ago.  He says technosexuals from all over the world are now contacting him, asking for shopping advice and finding a brotherhood of gadget geeks.  I don't know.  It sounds like he's used to saying cute purse as opposed to cool messenger bag. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  This guy loves pussy.  You can just tell from the way he talks.  No, that was good, Sam.  You know, sometimes they're not all home runs.  Sometimes you're just trying to get the minute hand to pass to the top of the hour.  Oh, that's some music.  Yeah, fan.  I want to thank everybody for checking out the Fan at Sam show.  It's been a good show.  If you want to download some of our material, go to fansam.com.  Yes, fan at sam.com and listen to our podcast, of which we got another one, I think. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  By the way, Brian from Staten Island.  Wow.  Your show is breaking down.  Call 911.  Wow.  I'm trying to fix it myself.  Well, sure.  They did a little bit of material on that subject.  Yeah, that was a tough one, though.  Let's be honest.  Come on.  Be honest now.  What the fuck were you giving us?  What are you hiding for your show?  Check his back pocket.  That was the worst fucking material to try to work with.  What do you got in your back pocket? 
[03:40:00]  I don't have anything in my back pocket.  I wish it did.  Technosexual.  Right, exactly.  It had nothing to do with anything.  The guy came up with it four months ago, and homos are fucking emailing him that they  want to suck his dick, and he's saying, oh, I want ideas on how to fucking be a technosexual.  Do you believe that?  We listen to two people who believe that.  Don't become part of this show.  What are you doing?  I'm commenting on how what you brought to our show sucked, and you're sitting there  like third mic.  No, you're right.  The world is a crazy thing.  I don't know. 
[03:40:30]  Stop it.  Turn it off.  He's obviously just a gay guy.  Stop it.  He wants to talk about computers all day.  This is not part of...  You're not part of this show.  He's calling himself like this.  A technosexual.  Music sound.  I've listened to clips.  I've listened to these guys talk about it.  I still don't know what it is.  Well, Anthony, you seem kind of into it.  No, stop trying to make it an O-T-A-S.  And really, O-T-A-S.  What is it?  It's not the O-T-A-S show.  Sato. 
[03:41:00]  Or Sato.  What was that guy thinking?  Yeah.  What?  He didn't even have a real, like, was it a...  Where was the sexual element to that?  I got the techno, right?  You're sure ending.  Yeah, you did get the techno part of it.  But where was the sexual element?  That's what I'm trying to figure out, too.  He's crazy.  He's insane.  I don't know why they would put this on the news.  I think he's a flaming homosexual.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  What do you think, Van?  Queer.  Yeah. 
[03:41:30]  Queer.  Consensus.  Let's put a poll up on Wackbag.  Do you think he's queer or not?  Turtle likes you.  Let's say hi to Turtle.  Turtle!  Hey, guys.  Love the Van and Sam show.  And you can check out more of them on VanandSam.com.  There you go.  Love the Flux.  That was cool.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jared in Baton Rouge as we get the line of the day together.  Yeah.  Jared?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up, Jared?  I want to know, are you...  Jared? 
[03:42:00]  Totally...  Hello?  Jesus.  Shift, for God's sake.  Okay.  Here we go.  Go ahead.  You guys be totally honest with me.  Yeah.  Okay.  Have you ever, when you were a young boy, with friends, perhaps in a tent in the backyard,  out late, sleeping over, you're playing truth or dare, and your friend dares you to grab his cock,  do you do it?  Jesus, dude.  That's not what you wanted to talk about.  First of all, I have, and I grabbed it with my mouth. 
[03:42:30]  Next question.  Is that, are you serious?  Because, you know, that happened later, you know, on another dare.  I didn't play truth or dare.  I don't remember how it happened.  We played monster, and we just did it.  It's okay.  You're normal, okay?  Now we got to move on to the hot stories.  Let's go to Luke in New Hampshire.  Luke!  Luke!  Luke.  Luke.  Luke.  God, we had two hot stories in there, God.  Is it a techno-sexual tie-in? 
[03:43:00]  No, it was when I was five.  My step-sister was 14.  She used to play with my dick.  That's better.  Luke!  When, uh...  Sexuals.  If he doesn't come on...  How about a story on perforated fucking cardboard boxes?  When I...  Ooh.  Perforated cardboard.  When I was, um, I think 17, I was, uh, going out with a girl that was maybe a little inappropriately  young for me at the time.  How old were you?  I was 17.  Perhaps she had just turned 14. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, I thought you were going to say she was six months.  No.  17, 14 is not bad.  Yeah, yeah, it wasn't.  And then she was, you know, she was very, you know, mature.  Retarded.  That was a good word, too.  She had the mind of a six-day old...  A six-day.  She, uh, she was a Girl Scout, and, um, she had a, a Girl Scout, like, uh, camp out going  on at Blydenberg Park out there on Long Island.  Mm-hmm.  And I snuck in to the campground and got into the, uh, her tent, and it was her and I think 
[03:44:00]  four other girls that were there, and they were all hanging out in nothing but their  T-shirts and their panties, and they were telling, like, little stories, and they were  kind of all, uh, kind of excited to have me in there.  They were, like, kind of, because it was, like, it was, um, it was against the rules and  everything, and I was this girl's boyfriend and everything, so it was kind of cool.  Well, the fucking, one of the chaperone mothers, whatever, den mother, or whatever they call 
[03:44:30]  it, uh, is coming toward the tent, and I had to lay down, uh, at the side of the tent  while all of the girls sat on me.  Holy shit!  They all just sat on me as the den mother came in to talk with them a little and make  sure they were okay, and then she left.  And, but it was just all these girls in their panties sitting on me, I was sitting there  just going, oh my god!  Were you in heaven?  This is fabulous! 
[03:45:00]  Did the den mother look in and wonder why Jim Croce was getting a face to him?  You probably had a mustache in this thing.  Nah, I had no facial hair and was very, very skinny.  Riley in Utah.  Probably could have been mistaken for one of the gals.  Riley!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, did you just say it's okay to suck another boy's cock, you fucking moat?  I said that I did a turn on Opie.  No, well, what happened was Jimmy admitted that he did the Monster Rain thing, and I felt  like the guy was really, really paranoid, and he just needed a friend to say it was okay. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  The guy was really, really deeply disturbed because it looked like he sucked a little cock  when he was a kid.  What's the matter, Riley?  You never opened up your mouth, maybe put another man's dick in it?  I was just, he's just laughing.  I was just trying to help him out.  He seemed like he was suicidal because we were bringing up some deep, dark secrets in  our lives, and it reminded him of one, and we just talked him off the ledge.  That's all.  Absolutely.  Yeah, that's right.  Are you all right, Riley? 
[03:46:00]  Oh, yeah, man.  Come on, Riley.  You remember.  Yeah.  Yeah, when did you suck your first cock?  Come on.  Let's go.  Let's get into it.  One time, you had your mouth open, a dick slipped in there.  You felt it would be rude to comment, so you left it there for a little while.  You didn't want to seem like an ungrateful host.  And after all, it was Christmas, and Daddy told me, you know, I wouldn't get my Christmas  friend.  Yeah, something.  Right, Riley?  Santa fucked your mouth, but he smelled a lot like alcohol on your father's cologne.  Come on, Riley, you cocksucker.  What's your story?  Let's hear it.  Come on.  Come on, you dick smoker. 
[03:46:30]  I do remember building snowmounds and laying on them so my little mule would lay on them,  and I'd just cum in my pants over and over and over.  Okay.  There you go, Riley.  He fucked a snowman.  That's funny.  That's what we're getting at today, Riley.  Don't suck a dick, but frozen rain is fair game.  Yeah.  You could fuck a snowman.  And he failed to mention that it was the carrot he was rubbing up against.  Yeah, he was sucking on that carrot.  All right, Riley. 
[03:47:00]  You good?  Bono!  Bono.  Bono.  Of course.  All right.  Come on.  We want to go all the way.  But there's so many funny stories.  Did you see bubbles?  Yeah.  What was that?  Oh, my.  Listen.  This is horrible.  Bubbles!  Hello.  All right, Bubbles.  Look.  Yeah, in high school.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Bubbles.  Are you just doing this for the laugh, or is this real?  Bubbles?  Yeah, right here.  Yeah.  Are you just doing this for the laugh, or is your story real? 
[03:47:30]  No, my story is real.  All right.  In high school, my girlfriend and I, after we headed out of school for the rest of the  day, because I'm only 18 at the time, I went back to my house, and we started getting  it on, I guess I should say, and we're 69, I remember 69, it's my first time, so I stuck  my tongue in her vag, and it kind of tasted like a salt wheel from a hamster, you know,  that sweat, and so I said, all right, enough of that, so I went up to her ass, and I looked  at her asshole, I saw a little piece of brown nugget, I think it might have been, so I put 
[03:48:00]  my nose in there just to take a whiff, and it was actually the smell of shit, so I was  like, fuck it, I was horny at the time, so I jammed my tongue up her ass, and she spread  her asshole wide open to get further up into her asshole, and I said, oh, this is fucking  nasty, so after this, she let me bang her in her ass, so I put a condom on, and as I  was done with that, I pulled my condom off, looked at my condom, and there was shit all  over the place, so now every time I have to bang a girl, we're 69, I have to, as a female, 
[03:48:30]  I have to take a shower every time I bang a girl, so it's kind of bad.  Oh my god, yeah.  God bless XF.  But you, like, you pretty much, like, stuck your tongue up her shitty asshole first.  Yeah, man, that was the shit, man, that was horny as hell.  Wow.  Preaching to the choir.  Jim didn't even look up from, like, the newspaper during that story, he's just like, business  as usual, fucking rookie.  Eh, whatever.  All right, Bubbles, when does this story get odd or exciting?  Yeah, absolutely.  Good job, kid.  Free banger.  All right, let's say hi to Tim and Rye. 
[03:49:00]  We'll go until someone blows it.  That's what we're doing now.  We might go bonus.  Jimmy, I'll pull my fly down so we can get out of here.  Oh, no.  Oh, I thought you meant that way.  Sorry.  We might go bonus time.  As soon as we get a bad story, we're out.  So it's up to you today.  Tim and Rye, what's up?  Yeah, it's Tom, but no big deal.  Ah, blew it.  I feel like I'm on the spot now.  All right, I got a question for Jimmy.  I used to have my neighbor who used to let me come over, and, you know, she'd change and 
[03:49:30]  let me watch and stuff like that, but I wasn't really sure if that's the right thing to do  or not.  She's only eight, and it happened yesterday.  All right.  Well, we'll be seeing you tomorrow.  Oh, come on.  I was kind of into this bit, too.  That was a classic blow it.  Come on.  Oh, is that awful?  Yeah, but we got a chicken line.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[03:50:00]  Didn't the guy fuck up his delivery, too?  Like, it's only eight, and then...  He froze.  He knew it was all on him, whether the show continued or not.  The course of history would change depending on him.  This is unorthodox, but let's give it another try.  Oh, fuck.  One more try.  All right.  Because it's a girl.  A girl.  By the way, G-Baby saying, best story ever.  The poo in the ass.  That one was good.  And the guy told it well.  Bubbles rocks.  Bubbles.  Maria, Long Island, what's up? 
[03:50:30]  Hey, boys.  Hey.  All right.  My first time ever with a girl was when I was five.  What?  Yeah.  I had a friend in kindergarten.  She had saw something that her parents had done, and she wanted to copy it.  Uh-oh.  So she came over to my house.  She told me to take my pants off.  She wanted me to kiss her, so we kissed.  And she took her pants off and told me to kiss her underwear in between her legs.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:51:00]  What a champ.  How'd she learn so quickly?  I know.  What a fucking...  How old are you now?  I'm 25.  God, she must be a great girlfriend than the other chick.  So, you know, from kindergarten to second grade, actually maybe third grade, we would get  together at her house and my house, door shut, door locked, and we would basically get  naked and do the things that she saw her parents do.  Or I guess her parents had pay-per-view, and she got to see porn, so she wanted to emulate 
[03:51:30]  that.  So, we stopped being friends in third grade, but then around 13, 14 years old, when my  she got some stuff started, I, of course, was interested in girls, and the first time,  you know, when you're in the pool and you have that filter thing that spits the water  out and it kind of brings up all those feelings in you if you just put your middle right up  to it.  The water jet?  Yeah.  The water jet.  Well, all of a sudden, I got that feeling that I remembered from when I was in second  grade, and then it was just constant masturbation after that, thinking of girls. 
[03:52:00]  All right, game on.  Game on.  Wow, she brought us right back from the dead.  Oh, Jimmy.  Boy, you got Jimmy going.  Is that Jimmy or Jeffrey?  Oh, it's Jimmy.  I had to look up.  Okay.  That was a fucking great story, man.  She was only fucking eight years old.  Five.  Five.  Oh, no, I'm talking about the guy who called before her.  I'm glad I got the gay ass.  Right on. 
[03:52:30]  All right.  Game on.  We move on to the next call.  Chris Westchester, what's up?  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  My first time calling, so I'm a little bit nervous.  All right.  So when I was six or seven, my cousin, who was five years older than me, so she was probably,  I don't know, like 12.  Did you say she?  She, yeah.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  So she used to come over and could make me take my pants off, and she'd take her pants  off, and she had hair. 
[03:53:00]  I didn't, because I was younger, so I was completely, like, bald or whatever, and she used to take,  like, a bobby pin, for whatever reason.  It was a bobby pin, and just, like, gently rub me down there, and then I'd have to do it  to her, and that was, like, always, like, the constant thing, but it was never with her  hand.  It was always, like, with a bobby pin.  A bobby pin?  Yeah.  Isn't that weird?  But...  That is really odd.  Yeah, it was odd, but I don't know.  I guess what makes it weirder is that we would never do, like, the hands, but from what I  can remember, like, I'm trying to think, like, she would put her face kind of close to me, 
[03:53:30]  and I was young.  Like, I didn't know what I was doing, and she would tell me exactly what to do to her  and what to do, you know, what she would do to me.  You fucking perverted little girls.  Jesus Christ.  Okay, so whatever happened, are you still in touch with this molesting dyke?  No.  He lives in Florida, actually.  Yeah, really.  You were fucking molested.  Exactly.  So are you still friendly with this abusive carpet muncher? 
[03:54:00]  No.  Cool.  I don't know.  Wow.  It's not even remotely close, but...  And do you ever use bobby pins anymore?  They just make you break out in a cold sweat?  No.  No.  I won't even put them in my hair.  Big black negro.  This is the sexiest story ever.  Five-year-old lesbos.  I know.  Moving backwards.  Fucking...  And then split fuck from North Carolina.  How could he let the line, her ass tasted like a hamster salt wheel, go by?  I know.  That was... 
[03:54:30]  His hamster salt wheel.  I know.  Axel Rosenberg.  That was good.  The print's way too tiny, Axel.  You might want to make that bigger.  I thought Chris Hansen was going to walk in during the middle of that last phone call.  I know.  For the pen in his pants, it'd be even right.  So I see.  And Mr. Bildo from Detroit.  She had hair, I didn't.  Line of the day.  I see you brought bobby pins with you.  Right.  Why don't you take a seat over there?  Have some lemonade and cookies.  All right, Chris.  Thank you. 
[03:55:00]  You're welcome.  We move on.  Who's going to ruin it?  Let's go to Joel in Wisconsin.  Joel.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  When I was in first grade, I had a 16-year-old babysitter who was kind of hot.  And as soon as my mom left, she told me and my brother, she was like, you guys want  to play rape?  I was too young to even know what rape was.  But she basically went in our bed, turned the lights off, and took her clothes off.  And she had me and my brother just basically fondle her.  And I was too naive to really enjoy it. 
[03:55:30]  For me, it was just more fun hurrying up and flipping the lights on, trying to see her naked.  And that kind of ruined it all for us.  Wait, how old were you guys?  I was in first grade.  My brother was like two years older.  And like I say, I didn't even know what the word meant, you know?  All right.  So you're talking like five and seven-year-olds, give or take.  And how old was she?  She was 16.  And she was kind of hot.  And then to top it off, I screwed it up for her because I told my mom.  Of course you did.  How do you not tell your parents when you're that young? 
[03:56:00]  Like, oh, what did you do?  Oh, we played rape.  Because we played the rape game, mommy.  Why do you tell your parents at that age?  Because it's just as bad as murder.  You really think that this is just something you have to tell the authorities about.  I think it's just because it's something fun, maybe.  And you're just like, oh, we have fun.  We played rape.  All right.  Well, what's that?  Oh, she got naked.  And we jumped on her.  And what?  I never told.  Did she have big boobies?  By the way, yeah, actually, they were pretty nice.  You know, grapefruit size.  They were all right. 
[03:56:30]  By the way, you were talking about the 17 and 14 before I was 18.  And my girl was 14.  And I ended up marrying her.  And 20 years later, we're still together.  Wow.  Well, that's not the way.  I mean, when you're talking about that.  That's not weird.  That's just stupid.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Game's still on.  Let's go to Tom in California.  Tom?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I got this nasty anal story that happened to me up in Hampton Beach.  New Hampshire about 10 years ago. 
[03:57:00]  I was up there drinking on the beach.  Met this girl.  Yada, yada, yada.  We go back to my car.  I started fucking her.  And then I started fucking her in the ass.  And I guess she's telling me, don't pull out.  But all I heard was, pull out.  I pull out.  This bitch projectile shitted all over me.  All over my face.  All over my chest.  You know that scene from Kill Bill where that bitch has that sword in?  And all you can see is just like that silhouette of fucking blood behind it.  It was the same shit in a Buick.  I fucking left the thing there. 
[03:57:30]  He abandoned his car.  Abandoned the car.  It was fucking disgusting.  Oh, man.  It wasn't like a little bit.  It was like...  Pull out.  All over the place.  Anyhow, you guys rock.  Yes.  What'd you lubricate your dick with?  Fucking mosquito blood?  How does she shit like that?  Game still on?  Thumbs up, right?  All right. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  Fucking poured some botulism in there.  Jesus.  Fucking Quincy has to go in.  You got to leave your cock in the rest.  Sam.  Sam.  Big Black Negro's back.  What's next, guys?  Period fucking?  Well, we talked about that.  Game still on, right?  Period fucking disgusting.  Cindy from Jersey.  Cindy.  Who's going to blow it?  Okay.  I was 10 years old, and me and a group of girls were in a van going to a birthday party. 
[03:58:30]  Was it a monarchy?  I wish.  And her dad was in the front seat driving, and my friend brought up...  He goes, Ew, have you ever tasted a tongue?  And we're like, Ew, no, no, no, no, it's gross.  And she said, Well, let's try it.  And her dad's in the front seat, so we stick out our tongues, and we're tucking tongues, and we're just like, Ew, gross, gross.  And all of us do it.  And he's sitting there, not saying a word, just watching this go on the whole entire time. 
[03:59:00]  As you girls are sucking on each other's tongues?  Yeah.  And we did other stuff, like, later on in the day, when no one was around, like, Oh, I'm going to touch this part, your boobie, hee-hee, and that was about it.  That's, uh...  The boom gets to all of you.  All right.  Good for you, baby.  I say, uh...  The father was, uh...  That's great.  A little shaky, but I say game's still on.  Oh, yeah, it wasn't bad.  I mean, it wasn't a big story, but it was just good old dad.  Will it be Crotch Critter that rexed this? 
[03:59:30]  It was fucking Reuben Kincaid driving the fucking bus, probably all sat in the back.  Susan Day tried to finger Bonaduce's ass, because she thought she was a chick.  A red-headed girl.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I thought you were Rocky Dennis.  Crotch Critter.  It's to you.  Hey, O&A.  Who's going to run this?  Okay.  Let's hope not.  Basically, I was stationed...  Well, my folks were stationed over in Japan.  I was, uh...  Let's see, seven or eight years old. 
[04:00:00]  They decide...  Because they both worked and everything else.  They decide to go ahead and get me a babysitter.  She's about 21.  I'd say probably about two...  Maybe 230.  She's got the most massive boobs you've ever seen.  And she's black.  We sit there.  It's about two, three weeks into it.  You know, I'm coming home and sit on her lap and watching Tom and Jerry and everything.  End up about two weeks into it.  It started off with just, you know, putting my hand down her shirt, just seeing if I could get away with it. 
[04:00:30]  So I'm playing with her nipples.  She wouldn't let me look at her boobs.  But I could stick my hand out of there.  Then it goes from that to hand jobs, where she's giving me a hand job down on my little shorts.  Then, probably a month into it, it turns into...  I can't look at her.  She won't take all of her clothes off.  But she'll let me sit there and rub my little beard on her snatch from behind.  This goes on for six months. 
[04:01:00]  And to this day, I cannot look at Tom and Jerry without getting a chubby man.  Wow.  Game's still way on.  Punch it out, boys.  Good story, Crotch Critter.  I have the same feeling about Tom and Jerry, but for different reasons.  I just think that the mouse is fuckable.  This is very cute.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  John?  Yes, I think I can put an end to this, and you guys can go home. 
[04:01:30]  Thank you, John.  All right, John.  You're very welcome.  All right, when I used to come home from school, I'd be about 11 years old, 12 years old.  Dad had just a file of porno up in his closet, all right?  And, you know, I would get all worked up in my room.  My parents wouldn't be home.  And I would think, all right, I'll go check out some porn.  So one day, I got my little 12-year-old rod.  And I popped the tape in.  And I'm doing my business.  You know, there's a picture of this dude fingering some bitch or whatever. 
[04:02:00]  So the camera pans out, and it is mom and dad.  So I finished up and cleaned up, and everything went well.  Absolutely horrific.  All right, we're wobbling now.  We're wobbling.  Game away on.  Horrific.  Horrific.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, we're wobbling.  We're wobbling a little bit.  Yeah, we understand.  We can finish stuff.  We heard you.  We heard you the first time. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, God.  If that isn't, like, done.  All right.  Let's see if we can keep game on.  Eric in New York.  Eric.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  When I was six years old, I had a neighbor, 28 years old, she would purposely lay down  on the couch, and for some reason, at that age, I had a foot fetish, and she would let  me play with her feet.  She had nice feet, nice legs shaved, and she would just let me play with her feet, you know, 
[04:03:00]  kiss them.  When I get to kissing and licking, she would just, you know, kind of let me stop, but then  I would start again, and she didn't mind it at all.  And you know what's going on here?  The parents are out just dinner and a movie.  Yeah, they think everything's fine and dandy.  No clue what's going on.  And she had a kid, you know, like a six-month-old kid, I remember, in the crib at that time, you  know?  Right, right.  But the husband was away at work, and I was a six-year-old.  She was, like, babysitting me, and she would lay on the couch reading a book, and I would 
[04:03:30]  be at her feet.  Imagine how fucking emasculated you'd feel if you'd walk in and see a six-year-old fucking  around with your wife.  Especially if his cock was bigger.  All right.  From that point forward, you're only allowed to babysit Asians.  So wait, is that guy still on the phone?  I know.  I wonder if he's still a foot guy.  Like, did I stick with him?  It's obvious he is.  He was getting off just telling us about that.  Oh, creepo.  Let's say hi to Louisha from Oklahoma.  Louisha.  Hey.  Hello.  Hi, Louisha. 
[04:04:00]  Hello.  I have an embarrassing story.  17 years old, and I had a five- and seven-year-old girl neighbor that I used to babysit.  About my third time babysitting them, I was checking them at night, and they're in the same bed.  So I hear something.  What is going on?  So I go over there, and I hear this coming.  And I pull back the covers, and no lie, they had their mom's vibrator, and she was using it on the younger one. 
[04:04:30]  And I freaked out.  So you walked in on the two kids using a vibrator on each other.  Game way on.  Frickin' kids are just perverts.  They are.  They're little fucking perverts.  Why is Chris Hansen here with a film crew?  Hi.  They're all worried about, you know, what we say on the radio affecting kids and what's on TV.  These kids are just going off by themselves and fucking teaching each other. 
[04:05:00]  And this is all before cable TV, by the way.  Yeah.  These are old, old stories.  Louisa, so what did you do?  She handed it to me, and I was panicking.  Give me that.  Let me show you how it's done.  Yeah.  Stupid kids.  You know what?  I'm like, where did you get this?  I was desperate to get this back where it was in case they thought I had it out.  Oh, imagine the parents walk in right when you have it in your hand.  And there's two new children over the bed.  Two naked kids in the bed, and you're trying to explain.  Believe me, it's not easy. 
[04:05:30]  Nightmare.  I don't know why.  Some people have got to die if you're in that situation.  Absolutely.  I've got to tell your parents.  No, they did this, and they taped up their own mouths and hands.  I don't know why I find this so funny.  Ever since the guy said five-year-old Lesbos, I've been just laughing inside.  And now we've got this guy.  Oh, wow.  The feedback's flying in.  Canon, Chris, here you go.  Halifax.  I have two kids in daycare right now, and the woman taking care of them is fairly hot.  Hopefully, my four-year-old is jamming her right now. 
[04:06:00]  All right.  It's still on.  Game's still on.  Let's say hi to Cracker in Texas.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Howdy.  Hey, Cracker.  I had a bad experience, man, when I was a kid.  I grabbed my dad's balls, man.  It was horrible.  Wait.  I want to hear that.  Oh, no, man.  You what?  I grabbed my dad's nuts on accident, man.  Okay.  Terrific. 
[04:06:30]  Wait.  Why on accident?  How did that happen?  Was he making you work in the shaft?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a runner-up line today.  I'll save you the one.  That's good.  That's the first runner-up line of the day.  What happened?  He had this chair.  It was like an Archie Bunker chair.  He was the only one allowed to sit in it.  And I was underneath it.  Are y'all still there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're jerking off.  Anyway, it had this fuzzy felt underneath the chair. 
[04:07:00]  And when it was in the reclined position, it had one of those wooden handles on the side,  and it would recline, and this leg support thing would come up.  Well, this fuzzy felt was hanging down, and I was under there playing with these action figures,  and he was sitting at the edge like watching a game.  And I looked up and saw something hanging down and figured it wasn't part of the chair,  and I reached up and grabbed them, and they just shot right out of my hand.  And I knew right then and there what it was, and I took off running into the game room 
[04:07:30]  and watched him come out of the kitchen with a utility broom and flip the chair over.  And I never told him anything about grabbing his nuts until years later he passed away.  And I told my mom about it, and she spit her beer and started laughing  and remembered that he had told her that something grabbed his nuts that day,  and she thought, you know, he had lost his mind.  I don't know you. Who is this? Don't come here. I'm hanging up the phone. 
[04:08:00]  Prank caller. Prank caller.  Sorry, guys.  Good for all right.  Oh, well. I guess it's time to eat lunch.  Yeah.  It was getting late anyway.  Well, I think we've got to go.  No, it's not like we have a million hot stories on hold now.  No, it's just more hot babysitter stories.  Yeah, we've got to go.  But, you know, rules are rules with this show. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah, we've got to.  Line of the Day brought to you by BodogFight.com.  Tune in to ION TV Tuesdays and Saturdays for episodes of Bodog Fights.  We're talking about the mixed martial arts action here.  I love those.  Yeah, I know. You're a big fan.  Fucking UFC stuff, man. Rules.  Fucking I'm obsessed with Mirko Krokop.  I want to fucking tangle with him.  Oh, go to BodogFight.com, Jimmy.  Check it out.  What do they have there?  Fight stuff?  Yeah.  Martial arts action.  Bunch of men.  You may get injured fighting him. 
[04:09:00]  A real answer to that?  No.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  So we take the challenge today.  In the first hour of the show, that's all we could find.  That was the only thing he did that had something to do with the funny department.  There's a real problem here.  Maybe you should have talked about something else in this AP article.  Yeah.  Who else is standing in the funny department with you?  Stalin and Mohammed Akka? 
[04:09:30]  That would be impossible.  Yeah.  Factually, I don't buy that.  I know.  It sucks.  But it is funny.  No, it sucks.  I hear my voice during the line of the day thing.  Mm-hmm.  I get all excited, like, oh my God, I did something.  And then all of a sudden, I just listen to myself just run out of steam.  And then Jimmy picks up the ball and slam dunks it.  Then it's over.  Yeah, you want to get really depressed?  Go home and look at the deposit slips I have. 
[04:10:00]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  The line of the day bonuses being handed out.  But it was just all these girls in their panties sitting on me.  I was sitting there just going, oh my God.  Are you in heaven?  This is fabulous.  Did the den mother look in and wonder why Jim Croce was getting a face to me?  I don't know if that was ever up.  Jim Croce.  There were a lot more funny lines, I think.  I'll agree. 
[04:10:30]  Yeah.  So do I.  Oh, don't worry about it.  Oh, Than's sad now.  Oh, Than.  Oh, Than.  He drained himself doing the Than and Sam show.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Oh, what am I doing?  Oh, yeah.
