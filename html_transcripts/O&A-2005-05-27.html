<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Jay Moore, back on the XM show for the first time, delivering a scathing critique of Audio Slave, labeling them as an “all-star team” that ripped off Zeppelin riffs. He also criticized Rage Against the Machine's lyrics about the government while living in luxury, setting the tone for a highly offensive broadcast filled with homophobic slurs, misogynistic remarks, and racist language.

The conversation jumped between the upcoming papal election, with tasteless jokes about a black pope and a “Pope Fear Factor” scenario; the Air America documentary and its personalities; Eddie Murphy's "Party All the Time"; the hosts' past use of the word "whores" and their attempt to achieve a "legit" image; and the downsizing of Frank's Place, a neighboring studio.

A phone call with comedian Rich Voss followed, who was stranded at an airport due to his child's missing birth certificate.  This sparked a heated exchange, with Opie and Anthony criticizing Voss's perceived arrogance and online complaints.  The conversation covered Voss's platinum airline status, cancelled television shows, Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger's personalities, sexually explicit anecdotes from Moore and Voss, and a review of *Rock and Roll Circus*.  Other guests mentioned included Tracy Morgan and the puppet act Otto and George.  The segment ended with continued discussion of Voss's airport woes and offensive online pornography.

The show then delved into the case of Esteban Carpio, arrested for shooting a Providence police detective.  Graphic details of Carpio's injuries were discussed, along with his guilt, and his family's outraged reaction.  Audio clips of their court outburst were played.  Tangents included discussions on infomercials (particularly one featuring a guitar salesman named Esteban), Opie's increased blinking, Opie's celebrity encounters (including a claim of sleeping with Jack Nicholson's girlfriend), police brutality, Opie's experience with a persistent pizza delivery man (possibly linked to a peace activist's home invasion), a detailed analysis of *Raging Bull*, a Howard Stern XM commercial, and further discussion with Jay Moore,  Laszlo (a tech expert), and Bill Burr (a comedian).

The next segment shifted to a discussion about the military's use of remote-controlled aircraft, transitioning to the show's producer, Ben, his technological incompetence, and guest-booking methods.  Another phone call with Rich Voss detailed his delayed flight to (possibly mistakenly stated as) Atlantis due to his ex-wife's failure to obtain his daughter's birth certificate.  The conversation turned to Jay Moore's cancelled *Last Comic Standing* gig, with the hosts hinting at possessing damaging information about him.  A sexually suggestive and inappropriate phone call with Jay Moore's daughter followed.  Further tangents included a listener's iPod issues, opinions on George Michael, Bono, Steve Jobs, and Ralphie May, a critique of *Last Comic Standing*, a vulgar rant about waiting tables, and a racist and offensive discussion of the Vatican's papal election process, concluding with more racist and sexist comments and a discussion of a strip club experience in Prague.

The show continued with a confusing conversation about a book, possibly an autobiography, and its perceived timeline concerning a host's time on Saturday Night Live.  A phone call led to a discussion of Hustler magazine and disparaging remarks about women from various cities.  Crude sexual banter ensued, followed by a contentious call with Frenchie, a restaurant owner, accused of overcharging and being unpleasant.  A call from a fake "Dr. Smith" promoting "Golden Mood" resulted in mockery, interruptions, and jokes about pedophilia, malpractice, and drug abuse.

A call from "Wheelchair Fred" followed, with the hosts suggestively encouraging him to perform a sexual act with a dildo on air. Ben Bailey was present in studio during this segment.  Another segment featured a caller describing sexual activity in a bathtub, followed by a recurring bit about their incompetent intern, Ricky, who got lost while getting coffee and food.  Don and Jeanette from Sexits.com, an online personals website, attempted to promote their site amidst chaos and vulgar interruptions, including requests to see Jeanette’s breasts. Ricky's return, his embarrassment, and further joking concluded this segment, followed by a commercial for a fictional "Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook," with Jamie Heineman and Adam Savage of *Mythbusters* mentioned as endorsing "the worst of Opie and Anthony."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  There's a falcon in the studio.  Jay Moore stopped by for the first time, Anthony, huh?  Yes, it's the first time back at the XM show.  And a lot of people had a lot of questions why he wasn't on earlier.  I think a few of our fans called up to bash him.  It was a fine welcome back for Jay Moore.  He absolutely killed for us. 
[00:00:30]  And this is what it sounded like.  Here's O.B. and Anthony, When They Don't Suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Go and save your film.  Take it on me.  Go and save your film.  This is A Whole Lotta Love by Led Zeppelin.  They stole it.  You need coolin'.  I'm thinkin'. 
[00:01:00]  Okay, a little sideways.  A whole lot of love slowed down a little bit, right?  They're horrible.  You're right.  It is a little bit.  Audio Slave.  You don't like the Audio Slave, Jay Moore?  No, it's a fuckin' all-star team, and they steal Zeppelin's riffs.  Blame it on me!  It's a supergroup.  Oh, la, la, la.  Yeah, I'm a little tired of a supergroup.  I'm a little tired of Rage Against the Machine complaining about,  We're white, we're from Orange County, we're millionaires. 
[00:01:30]  Fuck the government!  That's so true, man.  Fucking faggot.  They really do stink.  Move to fucking Toronto with the rest of the faggots.  Most people don't realize they're all in mansions singing those lyrics.  You're so right.  Zach De La Roca.  Ugh.  I just got my NRA card.  Fuck the government.  Yeah.  Singing about how rich whitey should all die.  Rolling down Rodeo with a shotgun.  With a shotgun.  Wow, because that's where...  With the rag top down so his hair can't bloat.  That's right.  Well, that's where all the problems are, so...  Rodeo. 
[00:02:00]  Boy, really.  Tough targets.  Really, right.  Fucking cunty wasp woman.  Fucking shopping for purses.  Boy, that guy really takes care of business in the hood.  Fuck you.  Why doesn't he roll down a road in South Central?  Yeah.  Why don't you start there?  Of course not.  No one criticizes the black community in fucking music.  None of them do.  I will.  You're not in music, though.  Rolling down Rodeo with a shotgun.  I'm thinking of going back to my roots and getting into music.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Don't do that.  What?  Going to rap?  You know how many comedians have done that and failed miserably?  Oh, no comedians have done it. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Who?  Well, Eddie.  Who?  Eddie Murphy.  Yeah, Eddie Murphy.  Got a big hit.  Fucking party all the time.  Party all the time was great, dude.  Oh, shut up.  She fucking gave her number to every boy she saw.  My girl wants to.  And that was a Rick James song anyway.  Eddie Murphy had nothing to do with that, except that he sang it.  Oh, you got it?  Of course we got it.  We got this master computer, Jay.  Things have changed, buddy.  We don't have to go to Napster anymore and try to find it? 
[00:03:00]  Remember those days?  We asked for a song, and it's there within seconds.  If you could fast forward through it, though.  Remember the video?  Look at all the people that work for us now, Jay.  A bunch of creeps.  You guys are all great in the Air America documentary.  No one's been paid?  I heard Marc Maron came off as kind of whiny in that.  I didn't see it.  Really?  I didn't see it.  What are the odds?  I was going to say, you think? 
[00:03:30]  They all came off as like, they really think they were changing the world.  Like a fucking radio show.  Dude, I got to tell you one thing, though, man.  There really is no liberal voice in entertainment.  I mean, it was kind of nice to see that, finally.  Well, here's party all the time.  Oh.  The long intro.  I know.  We'll get to the hook, and then we'll move on.  He was 1,000% serious when he did this.  Yeah.  He's clapping in his leather. 
[00:04:00]  Here it comes.  Everybody.  My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time.  I love when he goes, yeah.  Time.  Hello, exactly.  O&A party rock.  O&A party rock.  Give me, uh, that's terrific. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, uh, oh, oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, party all the time.  She likes to fight it all the time.  Help me.  That ain't it.  Well.  Oh, shit.  Okay, terrific.  Hi.  No, I meant De Niro.  Oh, that's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[00:05:00]  That's terrific.  That's my new favorite, by the way.  All right.  You never come home at night.  Enough of that.  You never come home at night.  I know.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Jay Moore.  Yes.  That wasn't me singing.  I know.  His first live appearance on the new show.  It's a little different, huh?  From the old days.  What a bizarre place.  Why?  It's like you're going to the dentist.  Like the hallway and everything.  It's just very New York.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, office type thing.  You're right, you're right.  We're taking over this whole area. 
[00:05:30]  They're kicking all these guys out of here.  Where's Frank's Place?  Right there, across the way.  Frank's Place is now a closet across the office.  This line used to be that big, and they had to cut the sign down so it would fit in that  office.  In their small little studio over there.  This used to say Frank's Place, this huge O.P. and Anthony sign.  Did it really?  Yeah.  They ought to make a Frank's Place sign that's like three feet by one foot now.  We kicked them out of here.  Good.  They were all Frank Sinatra albums lining the studio.  We came in and went, oh, these are going to have to go.  And the guy was all pissed off.  No surprise, after the first week, we pissed off a lot of people. 
[00:06:00]  Poor Frank's Place.  And now it's that little closet over there.  It's like just a little, little room.  Is that where Eddie Trunk does his show from?  Yeah.  I think it is.  He does this hard rock, heavy metal show.  What, Eddie?  It sounds like it should be in a big, huge place with studio lighting, like concert lighting  and stuff, and he's in a closet doing himself.  And staring at a sign that says Frank's Place.  And you have to look across here and see this big, empty, roomy studio.  No one using it.  No one's allowed to use it. 
[00:06:30]  So that's the couch when the hit was coming?  Yeah.  We don't do as many whores now.  These days, Jay.  Yeah.  I haven't been around.  We, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Our program directors used to force us to do those shows.  So now we're trying to go legit.  We never wanted to do those shows.  Yeah, man.  Man.  Lion sack of shit.  So is this today's post?  Yes.  Holy smoke?  Yeah, that's the post's funny headline of the day.  And black smoke means no pope.  No pope.  No pope.  No pope today. 
[00:07:00]  But they say by Wednesday or Thursday they'll have one.  How do you know?  But they say it's like crazy positioning and jockeying.  Big power moves, yeah.  It's like Survivor almost.  Like they rally for, no, I was watching like three different, like, guys on the news, like  Friars going, it's like you just sway votes and like a long shot becomes a number one guy.  Alliances are made.  Totally.  Really?  No fucking around.  It's completely political.  And, uh, I'm just, I'm holding out hope that they get the black one.  You think there's a, is there one up for grabs? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, there's a black guy.  There's three of them.  There's three black guys.  Supposedly he's one of the faves.  He's the one holding his dick.  That never happens.  Dude, people are betting online who's going to become the next pope.  I thought you just knew.  I thought, I thought you go in that ruin and you just know.  Oh, we know when push comes to shove it's going to be this guy.  Well, you just see like the light coming from heaven, like kind of shining on one guy.  There's no jockeying.  There's no jockeying.  There's just no.  Right?  No, they jockey.  Look how it should be.  They're not electing a black pope.  They're not going to do it.  No, there's no black pope. 
[00:08:00]  They should do it.  He's going to bring his own wardrobe, but they're not going to do it.  Popemobile is lowered and escalated.  Hit my Popemobile.  Who the fuck shot me, nigga?  Hit my ride.  Yo, call my nigga, Damon Dash.  This motherfucker shot me.  Give me some of that XM satellite radio for the month.  Yo, yo, Rockefeller, y'all.  Taking all the paintings off the wall, hanging up good time shit.  Yo, son.  Yo, nigga, I feel bug nice.  I'm about to bless all these motherfuckers out here tonight. 
[00:08:30]  I feel bug nice right now.  Pontiff style, nigga.  Box cutter.  Yo, Butter Peek and Reekin.  My girl's fine as fuck, but you know I don't go.  I sound like Tracy Morgan, Jay Moore.  Yo, why'd you trim my mustache?  Did you have Tracy in?  Yeah, he was fun.  Tracy was great.  That was Friday, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  He should have a reality show, like people following him around.  Well, they're saying, though, that we're going to have a... 
[00:09:00]  Let's finish with the Pope, though.  They're saying by Wednesday, like tomorrow?  Yeah.  No way.  No way.  They want to move this.  For what?  For all the t-shirts?  Publicity.  I went to the Vatican and all I got was half a Pope.  That would have been a great reality show, like Survivor.  That wasn't even a joke.  No, half a Pope.  You know what that means.  I went to the Vatican and all I got was half a Pope.  Die, sir.  I could have, like, challenges.  We got Otto and George in here also about a month ago, and George never said a word. 
[00:09:30]  He was quiet.  Like, Otto said a couple of things, but George just sat there and said nothing, and I really  like hearing from George when Otto and George come in.  He left, Otto left me a message.  He's like, yeah, man.  I was kind of quiet when I came in.  He's like, I want to come back.  I'm like, dude, it's just tiring.  It's hard to...  Guys that aren't used to waking up at, like, 5 o'clock in the morning and coming in just  doing radio, it's fucking horrible.  No, believe me, during afternoon drive when he came in, it was a pisser, you know?  He'll be back.  But, you know, Otto, I think he has to understand, the puppet's got to talk when he comes in. 
[00:10:00]  He goes through the trouble of putting it on his hand and everything.  There was a whole...  You kind of want to hear from the puppet.  There was a whole thing going on that day, though.  Really?  Oh, he was just beyond nervous.  He just lost it.  Why was that?  I don't know.  You could see it in his eyes.  He was, like, just panicking in front of us.  He even said to me, he's like, it was like a reunion between me and you, me and him.  I haven't seen each other in about two years or a year and a half between me and the guy.  Wasn't there some chick in here that day?  I don't know.  Doing something and reading the news with a top off, maybe?  No.  People never got that.  No?  We never got that.  We did, and, like, I was waiting for George to say something, and he was just like, 
[00:10:30]  I got nothing.  No, it's like the old...  Ah, hula!  Ah, hula.  It's like the old show.  We still got to beg.  Still got to beg.  I think we got Mary Carey coming in this week.  Thursday.  You're coming back for that, right?  No, I got to work.  What?  Who are you doing a movie with?  Excuse me.  It's a Ned Burns movie.  Can I meet him?  I want to get a picture with him.  Really?  No surprise there.  I like your website a lot, Jimmy.  I tried to email you, but it wouldn't let me.  It has to be updated.  It's been so long.  Yours?  Oh, Jay, there are so many more you should see. 
[00:11:00]  You're killing everyone around you, Leon.  You want to talk to him?  You talk to him.  He'll kill me.  He won't listen to me.  I take pills to try to get away from you.  You want to talk to him?  You talk to him.  He'll kill me.  Give us all things.  Give us all things.  Okay, you got a boss, then why am I talking to you if you're the boss?  Any W, we play all the hits.  If you do old Pacino, you're really just doing Tyne daily.  Okay, any W, we play all the hits.  How you doing, Harvey?  Okay, well, you got a supervisor, then what am I talking to you for? 
[00:11:30]  Well, Vietnam veterans are killing their don't mean nothing to us.  Okay, who else has to go to the bathroom?  Let me go to the phones real fast.  Mike.  Go ahead, Mike.  Mike from Jersey?  Hi, you fucking fag.  What's up, Mikey?  Fucking bitch sucker fuck.  Thank you, Jack.  Jim, easy.  Whoa.  Pope Fear Factor style.  What do you mean?  Pick the Pope Fear Factor style?  Have a contest, like, who could fuck the most boys in under two minutes. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, that's awful.  How could you?  What?  Those boys.  That wasn't the whole idea.  Was there more to it, sir?  No, that's about it.  I don't know.  You can put whatever you want in it.  But they don't really do that on Fear Factor.  Like, the joke would have been they had to eat some stupid stuff.  That's right, like a pussy.  Boy.  Some foreign stuff.  A pussy.  You know, the black Pope would definitely be out.  Like, shit, I wouldn't eat that if I was fucking.  Only if it's fried.  He won't go down here unless it's fried. 
[00:12:30]  That's what I can't believe.  I mean, I said this when I was on the phone with you guys, but, like, for a guy with a  speech impediment, like, that makes Bugs Bunny seem like...  Somebody who speaks well, yeah.  Yeah.  All his punchlines are slurpy sounds.  And I'm dodging her.  Like, say avoiding.  You want to buy a dryer door?  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Anti-disestablishmentarianism.  All right.  He's got to call up if he's listening, and you've got to get him to say, eat sushi in 
[00:13:00]  church on Tuesday.  Those are the three words you can't say.  And he takes a big swallow before he gets started.  Oh, yeah.  You go, say it now.  And he goes...  Oh.  Sushi.  Sushi.  Who's this?  Oh, it's Amanda Peet.  She looks like...  What?  What's wrong with Amanda Peet?  I just...  I shoot higher than that.  That's all, brother.  Well, and you were telling us about that, yeah.  Now, look at this guy.  He's fucking hurt.  I'd bang Diane Sawyer in about two seconds.  I'm with you.  We had a discussion about this.  I'm with you. 
[00:13:30]  God, it smells like baby powder.  Yeah, those awful ham with Chinese eyes.  I don't know.  That older woman shit bugs me.  No, man.  For an older woman, she is.  You think they go a little more highbrow with the Pope's smokestack?  It looks like they just fucking got live footage from Patterson.  No Pope today.  Go home.  You'll never work this Vatican again, Terry.  Get somebody up there.  Jesus is down here on these docks.  The next minute, no, a bottle's going to get it right in the nose.  Where's Johnny Fragley? 
[00:14:00]  The best part, they installed that stupid chimney.  What was it before?  I don't know.  They just kind of have it in a warehouse until they need it.  Until they need it?  I thought it was always up there.  A little chrome top on it.  Show's over.  Come on.  Show's over.  Where's Johnny Fragley?  I love when he goes, oh, you guys with your quotes makes me so happy when I'm driving  around L.A.  When Brando's getting sworn in, and they go, do you swear to tell the whole truth, nothing  but the truth? 
[00:14:30]  And he goes, right.  That's a weird movie, because you've got the old guys like, yeah, see, Terry Malloy's  going to come and get you, Jim.  Mixed with Brando and Carl Malden, who are emoting and real guys, and they mix together.  And Brando and...  Lee J. Cobb was great.  It was Johnny Friendly.  Yeah.  It was phenomenal.  Brando and, what's his face? 
[00:15:00]  Steiger hated each other.  Steiger was like, yeah, it was you, kid.  Meh.  Meh, see?  Yeah, buddy.  Craig just got in a minute, man.  I was going to stare at him.  Meh, the frog.  And Buddy Hackett told me that Brando told him, in the back of the taxi cab, his whole  scene, all he was thinking was what a terrible actor Steiger was.  So when he goes, oh, no, Charlie, it was you, Charlie.  Oh, Charlie.  He was actually thinking, like, you fucking suck, Charlie.  Like, you're the worst actor ever.  And you see him go, like, yeah, kid, everything will be all right. 
[00:15:30]  And Brando just goes, oh, no.  It's like, wow.  It's just that you could see the disgust in his face.  Yeah, like, since he told me that.  And then Steiger wouldn't be there for, like, Brando's close-ups.  Wouldn't Brando, did he do the same thing as Steiger or no?  They just wouldn't, they wouldn't help each other with the, uh.  I don't think either one of them did it.  Bunch of fucking divas.  You guys, we got a surprise on the phone.  What?  Oh, what's happening?  Hey, Rick.  Hey, Rick.  I want to thank all my opening acts tonight.  Oh.  Look at the black girl. 
[00:16:00]  She's checking me out.  What's going on, Jay?  How are you?  Were you at the stress factory tonight?  No.  Well, I'm at the airplane.  We didn't get on the plane.  Why?  I was supposed to go to the Bahamas.  And my ex-wife didn't have a birth certificate for one of my kids.  Now, it's just a nightmare.  Oh, my God.  Didn't you check before you left the house?  Yeah, we had, so, whatever.  Social security card and some other stuff.  You need a birth certificate.  But it's a kid.  What is a kid going to do out of the, so what, does she have to take a cab home alone? 
[00:16:30]  No, we're waiting for her to go to City Hall and Plainfield and pick one up to come here  and try to get on the 11 o'clock flight.  I don't know.  What a pain in the ass.  This is your big vacation with your daughters, right?  Yeah.  Pretty big.  I mean, you know.  Is Bonnie going, too, or just three of you?  No, Bonnie's doing her special.  Half an hour special.  Oh, okay.  So, it's just you and your kids.  What channel is that going to be on?  I think it's on E right after you do the soup show. 
[00:17:00]  The what?  The what show?  The soup, talk soup or something.  I think she comes out right into that.  She's making soup on his shirt.  She's doing, she's doing.  Going from network TV to E, that's like going from Flamin' Yon to Scrapple.  What happened?  The host.  The show, and now you're doing weekly reader on TV.  The host's son, who was two years old, had open heart surgery and called me personally  and asked me to fill in.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  I'm sorry.  And KP Anderson, a good friend of mine, it was his first show as the executive producer. 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  Oh, that feels good.  See, Buzz, I do nice things for people.  The second you think you have something, they come out with the open heart surgery.  I know.  You can't come back from that.  Hope the kid's okay.  Well, Jay didn't want to do it at first.  The guy was begging me.  Jay said, I can't do six weeks, Jerry.  I can't do it.  You can't do it.  Three shows, I walk.  Three shows.  You're not in a position to walk yet.  Yet, I say. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, have they ever come clean and said why they canceled the last episode to the third  season?  No, I think it was because of Father of the Bride.  I think I heard, but nothing's confirmed, is that Katzenberg was like, yo.  That's how he talks.  Yo.  Yo, son.  Man flavor in your ear, Jewita.  He, I had to stop myself when I was about to say.  Father of the Bride wasn't getting the lead in numbers, so we had to fall in the sword for  the network, and then Father of the Bride got canceled two weeks after that, and then 
[00:18:30]  the contender gets canceled.  They're a fucking mess, NBC.  Yeah, obviously.  They could fuck a post.  They canceled the contender?  Yeah.  They canceled the last.  How do you cancel the last episode of this?  How do you, as a network executive, think that's a good move?  Let it run.  Just get a color guy one.  I don't want to show that.  Oh.  Good point, Rich.  Good point.  It's richvoss.com.  That's amazing.  Why wouldn't they, at the least, just throw it on late or something?  What do you think of this kid, Ashton Kutcher?  Fucking hot, man. 
[00:19:00]  That smile?  How do you resist?  He does have that, like, I fell asleep first, and they all beat off on my face in the group  home look about him.  Jesus, androgynous cocktease.  So, Richard, you're just waiting at an airport to go on this flight, huh?  Yeah, and I have a show tonight at the Atlantis.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  In the Stingray pool.  How long of a flight is it, sweetie?  Two and a half.  Three hours to Florida and an hour to the Bahamas.  Do you have a layover? 
[00:19:30]  What an idiot.  It's continental.  Direct.  What a dick.  They're all sold out.  Wow.  You'll be fine.  You'll make it.  He was trying to save a few bucks.  What an idiot.  He's got to take that Buddy Holly plane from Miami.  Yeah, it's creepy as hell.  I hate that.  You go over the water, the Miami, the propellers.  Right.  You're going to take a prop plane, Rich?  It's 2005, and he's on a propeller plane.  Yeah.  To save 50 bucks a ticket.  It was sold out.  He's such a liar.  I like to go on planes anything over a big plane.  Oh, really?  What's your logic there?  It's so easier to land.  It's ready to crash.  You're right, yes.  You're right, Dick Ebersole, Aaliyah, a million other people. 
[00:20:00]  You're absolutely right.  Payne Stewart.  Yeah, you're right.  Payne Stewart.  Way to go, Payne Stewart, stupid.  Yeah, because when you're landing in the ocean, it's a lot easier.  JFK Jr. out indefinitely, parentheses, ocean.  No, no, I'm not talking about the little, little planes.  I'm talking about the commuter planes.  The commuter prop planes.  You know, like the athletes are out, they put parentheses while they're out.  Dude, I got it.  JFK Jr. out.  Parentheses, ocean. 
[00:20:30]  Ocean.  Hey, Rich Voss, say sushi.  Raw fish.  Come on.  Sushi.  Sushi.  There's no problem there.  See that?  What do you mean no problem there?  It's all sorts of problems.  Hold on, let me swallow.  Ah, I told you.  Sushi.  Perfect.  Sushi in church on Tuesday.  Real quick, quick.  Sushi in church on Tuesday. 
[00:21:00]  Sushi in church on Tuesday.  Perfect.  See?  If I slow it down, it's pretty good.  If I slow it down.  You know what?  The way I talked and hold me back from carrying the first season of the dumb show, stupid,  okay?  Sushi in church on Tuesday.  What channel is Bonnie's special going to be on?  HBO.  Really?  Yeah.  I couldn't get an HBO special.  It's very nice. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, she's taping it Friday.  With that New Zealand group.  Yeah.  There's some weird group from New Zealand.  They're each two and a half.  You're doing it Tuesday?  Tuesday night, yeah.  Butterfly, you doing it Tuesday?  Yes, Tuesday.  I'm coming down.  I'm taping some stuff for the New Reality Network.  You know, they're launching the network with Last Comic Standing, the New Reality Network.  Last Comic Standing was such a good show.  It's like, as far as like, when you look at your network budget, why do you go to season 
[00:22:00]  three?  I mean, that's not Jay's call.  It was the network just probably being greedy and fucking brushing it.  They're greedy.  Go ahead, Rich.  You answer all these questions.  You're so inside.  If memory serves, I had to fly you out.  Wow.  What did he say?  Nothing.  He was basically implying that you're, um...  Jay was saying, uh, like that basically, that basically make a sarcastic remark as to  how I was asking inside questions and you were answering when he was the host and he's 
[00:22:30]  right here.  Well, here's the thing.  He's calling you an ass.  The thing is, they got greedy like the apprentice.  They took one month off and they already went to the third season, so they want to bury  that too.  What happens is they get very greedy and they think they know what the public wants.  The princess is doing well, sir.  You know that with the network.  They think, you know what?  Not one critic, not one critic said they liked the Anthony Clark show, but yet it's been  on the air for how many seasons?  But every critic loved, uh, what's that, you know, uh, uh, uh, what's the one on Fox? 
[00:23:00]  You know?  Oh, yeah.  Um...  I know why he's talking, because hot girls are walking by at the airport and he's like,  I'm doing an interview.  Hold on one second.  I'll tell you why.  The networks, they're miserable because their mother's taking up the fucking ass.  They only get in that show because he's going in the army next week.  Hey, is that you, Salvi?  I can hear you drooling while you say sushi.  And, you know, they, they, they take off the other one that all the critics love.  Which, is that show they took off, um... 
[00:23:30]  Uh, the one, you know, on Fox with the guys in Prisoner.  Yeah, that show, uh, Arrested Development?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did it actually have taken off the air?  No, no.  This Sunday, this Sunday's the last episode.  No, it's not.  It was the season finale.  That's the season finale.  Rick, the season finale, season's end, Rich.  It got, hold on, I just saw a goal for you with a squeegee in his hand.  Uh, it got canceled.  I read it.  Swing and a miss.  I know.  With a what in his hand? 
[00:24:00]  They're not all killers.  A squeegee.  I don't do well on that.  A what?  A squeegee?  A what?  A squeegee.  Third, not word, Rich.  A squeegee.  But it sounded like you said squeak.  A squeegee.  And then a squeegee.  It's a squeegee.  A squeegee.  First of all, you know what?  Years ago, you could have talked to me like that.  But now that I'm a national act, okay, it's still kind of funny. 
[00:24:30]  It's a squeegee.  Whatever.  What have we got here, a fucking comedian?  Are you at Caroline's while you're in the studio?  Are you at Caroline's?  Me?  He's just hanging out.  I'm here to promote nothing, brother.  I'm in town.  My word is solid, brother.  I'm here to promote Jimmy at the cellar.  Oh, okay.  Hold on. 
[00:25:00]  I'll be inside in a second.  I don't know.  I'll be inside.  I'll call in a second.  Wait, sweetie.  Sweetie.  So what's the next flight to lab?  What time was your flight supposed to be?  We had 7.30.  So we were here at 6 o'clock.  A bunch of Mexicans going to the beach.  It's unbelievable.  It's a nightmare.  It's 2 a.m.  So the next flight is 11.  What time is the one after that?  1 o'clock.  How about after that?  I don't know.  Go on the continental site.  There's that many flights to...  Oh, no.  He's not flying to the Bahamas. 
[00:25:30]  He's flying to Miami.  Miami.  Why don't you try booking a flight to the Bahamas?  Yeah.  Go direct.  Stupid.  Listen to me.  You think I fly every week.  You don't think I know that?  Why do you fly every week?  Is it because you're a national act?  Yes.  And I'm a platinum flyer, okay?  Are you platinum-ish?  Is that why your girlfriend has to open for you?  To help ticket sales?  No.  She opens for me because I like taking her on the road with me, okay?  Oh, I have a good time.  It's because I don't want to follow some stupid, horrible, you know, black act that's doing  white people this, white people that.  So then why do you bring her on the road with you? 
[00:26:00]  Because.  Are you...  Wait, wait, wait.  Are you really platinum?  Yeah.  I've been platinum for a year now.  Ooh.  Okay.  And wait, are you saying that I don't draw enough people myself?  Or are you saying that she's good and she draws people?  Because there was a time you would say she didn't draw people.  So what are you saying?  When did he turn into dice?  I don't know.  Rich, what's going on with you?  Hey, I'm breaking your balls.  Take it easy.  I know.  Relax, Rich.  No, I know.  I'm very relaxed. 
[00:26:30]  Are you kidding me?  I just got bumped up a plate.  Which way?  Medium or well done.  I can't be any more relaxed for what I'm going through right now.  And you know I stink on the phone.  Like when I'm in the studio, I'm a hundred times better.  I hate phoners, too.  You can't be funny on the phone.  And then I got to go on the dumb internet and hear how I stink.  I know, too.  Jay.  How they go, Rich Voss or Bobby Kelly.  Please, think Bobby Kelly's done a good point.  I don't know, Rich.  I was pretty funny on the phone.  I had no problem with it. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I was going to say, you know, to make a good point, because when Jay called from  L.A. for, I think he was on the phone for two hours, he sucked the whole time.  Who sucked?  Jay did the whole time?  Yeah.  Yeah, but we didn't know how to hang up on him.  See, you can't be funny on the phone.  Of course you can be funny on the phone.  No, you can't.  It's very hard.  You can be, but I don't particularly like the phone either.  Well, here's the thing.  You can be funny on the phone when you do some radio show that you do maybe once a year.  Right.  But when you're, you know, there all the time, you know, what are you going to say on the  phone?  You've got to be in the studio.  Everybody knows that. 
[00:27:30]  Hello?  Hello?  I've got people looking at me going, people walking by going, look, they can see that I'm  bombing.  They don't even know what I'm bombing.  They've got to look on their face like, oh, look at little midget fingers, son, it'd be  funny.  Hold on, I want the light.  There you go.  I'm bombing.  Here.  There you go.  I just got my finger.  Thank you.  Hey, Rich.  What?  How old's your daughter that you sent to City Hall?  I didn't send my daughter to City Hall. 
[00:28:00]  My daughters are 14 and 12.  I thought you said she was going to get her birth certificate or passport or something.  Yeah, you're a big star.  You couldn't talk your way through this situation?  Yeah, you can always talk your way into another country.  Okay?  You can't even get through security with a lighter, but I want to talk my way into another  country.  I'll tell you, you guys spend vacation, you go in a car.  All right?  We fly.  What?  But, whoa, easy.  Wait, what'd you say?  Dude, I didn't even get to take a vacation.  I was too busy being flown across country to shoot.  What'd you say? 
[00:28:30]  He thinks that Anthony and I jumped in a car for vacation.  We were popping a Greyhound bus.  But we spent a month talking about how we were going on some cool vacations.  I actually...  I went on a cruise for two weeks.  Yeah, I actually spent a week and a half at the place you're going to.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait.  I see what happened.  You're going to Atlantis, right?  I was there for a week and a half.  And I got a direct flight on the same airline that you're flying to Miami and then taking  a puddle jumper from Miami to the Bahamas, you fucking idiot. 
[00:29:00]  Jay Emerson.  That was great, Jim.  First of all...  Wait a minute.  I know what happened, boy.  And Anthony was on, like...  Anthony got the best room on a cruise ship.  And had a grand piano in two or three levels and a...  He heard cruise.  He thought that's why he said car.  He said I went on a cruise.  Oh, yeah.  Cruise, yeah.  He thought I was just cruising.  That would have been funny if we didn't, like, talk about what we were doing on vacation  for a month on this show.  Okay, yeah, but, you know, it's easy to do code words.  First of all, did you sit in first class when you went to Nassau? 
[00:29:30]  No, you were back in coach, okay?  I was in first class on the way to Los Angeles.  Wait a minute.  I've flown coach in years.  Anthony won't fly coach.  Hey, Rich, what a great way to polarize your audience.  You just tell them how stupid they all are because the poor bastards have to fly a coach.  Not me.  I'm a big shot, folks.  I fly first class.  Yeah, I have no problem saying I was in coach down in the Bahamas, but it was a direct flight.  Well, I have a big problem saying it because I'm better than most people who listen to this radio show,  and I'm a first class customer, for Pete's sake. 
[00:30:00]  You have no problem.  Of course you said, coach.  When we went to Miami, who got you bumped up to first class?  You were in shock.  You've never been in first class.  What's the deal today?  I don't know.  Why are you attacking everybody?  First of all, it's not true.  It was a nice gesture that I flew first class with you.  Okay, first of all, the only reason I'm attacking is because you have to be on the offensive line.  Dude, we can't help it.  We can't help it that you're bombing today.  You should just take your beating.  That's all.  Today?  Okay, first of all.  I like that.  I like that.  I've lost his swing. 
[00:30:30]  He's going down.  He's bringing somebody with him.  He's got his fucking little hand locked in somebody's hair.  Somebody is coming underwater with him.  I like that.  Yeah, I guess I respect that, sure.  Okay, here's the thing.  Like I said, you can't be funny on the phone.  You guys are sitting around going, oh, who can we call in trash?  Things might be going a little slow because Shay's in the studio doing horrible impressions that we've heard.  Okay?  Shay, why don't you do Pablo Francisco and kill two birds with one stone?  So then we go, let's call him boss and trash him. 
[00:31:00]  Let's hear him slobber on the phone.  He's not going to be funny.  So I've got to do what I've got to do to even stay afloat, even to get, like, one good post tonight on the Internet.  I'll be sitting in Atlantis looking at the dumb websites going, oh, he's stunk again.  Oh, boy.  Now they're not going to talk to me.  Oh, here we go.  Here's the silence.  So here's where I do my infomercial, richboss.com.  Order my DVD.  Am I still on?  You guys cut me off? 
[00:31:30]  They hung up on me.  That never gets a hold of me.  Oh, boss is nuts.  They hung up on me.  What is going on with him today?  That was really bizarre.  He's probably very tense.  He's a little uptight.  Yeah, man.  He's got to go gig and he was completely on the defensive.  Like, he's just on the offensive.  But everyone knows you can't even show up at the airport without that birth certificate.  No, it's a birth certificate.  Birth certificate.  Birth.  With his kids.  Flying to kids. 
[00:32:00]  Huh?  But wait, don't you need a passport?  I never brought a birth certificate.  You need a passport.  If you don't have a passport, you can bring a birth certificate.  But they're starting to give you a hard time even if you just have the birth certificate.  If you have a passport, you don't need that, right?  No.  Birth certificate is not going to be accepted, I think, after this summer.  Yeah, really soon.  You're going to need a passport.  Who is you?  I was told...  People are talking.  It's none of your business, especially when it's me and my brother.  Personally, I don't give a fuck what she eats.  Take your passport inside.  It stinks.  Got to go to the phones really fast.  You're making her cry. 
[00:32:30]  I'm going to make you cry.  Jeff in Canada.  Don't tell Lenore.  Listen, text him illegally.  Hold on.  Hey, man.  Hold on.  I got some.  Jeff, go.  Yeah, a fucking stupid boss talking about bombing while he's sitting in a fucking airport.  Holy fuck.  That would be great.  A security postman for a body cavity search.  A guy walked by and watched when I'm bombing.  I'm bombing.  There's someone over there talking about a bomb.  No, you don't understand.  Who is that on the phone right now?  Who is that guy?  That was Jeff from Canada listening to XM illegally. 
[00:33:00]  Jeff from Canada.  Wow.  That was really...  I never would have thought of that.  But I just woke up.  They're wrestling as midget potty down to the ground as we speak.  I'm here at the airport.  I'm bombing.  Girls, call your mom.  Tell her I got to be bailed out.  There's 1,600 in my front right pocket.  Sorry, but you're talking about a bomb or something.  Guess I was bombing.  I'm bombing here.  Come with us, please.  Right now, their cavity search in the back room and he has to explain why he just came all over his leg. 
[00:33:30]  Look at the black cop checking me out.  Oh, what a zilch.  This is going to be a lot of fun today.  I'm boss's best man at his wedding.  When he gets married in September.  Yeah.  You've got to give the toast.  Are you any good at that?  Have you done that before?  I've never been in a wedding party.  I've never been in a wedding party.  Wow.  I was kind of like a fringe player in one, but I've never been in a wedding party.  You've got to cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, and then you've got to give a toast.  Don't you guys, like, when you say, like, grace, I don't know if you ever say grace, or, like, if you ever have to give a toast, like, you kind of, even if you get to speak at a funeral, you can't, you have to kill. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  You have to, like, nail it.  You really do have to nail it.  Like, a friend of mine spoke at, uh, it was Dick Ebersole's funeral, actually.  Peter Engel.  And he said, uh...  Oh, Peter, okay.  I said, how'd you do?  Dick Ebersole didn't die.  How'd you do?  Give me the sons.  No, you know what?  It was Linda Mancuso's funeral.  Sorry.  Someone, no one you know's funeral, and he spoke at it, and I said, how did it go?  He goes, I gotta be honest with you, I killed. 
[00:34:30]  And I was like, you know what?  Like, you, it really is, like, you do take pride.  Like, that was the best fucking toast.  Follow that toast.  Yeah.  You got it.  You got it.  Like Jerry Lee Lewis to Chuck Berry.  Follow that, nigger.  Oh, yeah, I heard about that.  Jesus.  What?  He said it.  He did say it to him.  Come on stage.  Yeah.  Lit the piano on fire and said it.  Follow that, nigger.  You can ask Chuck Berry, but he's taking a dump on Voss.  I got nothing.  I like Chuck Berry.  No, you have a lot.  Jay Moore in studio.  God, Voss was, like, really, like, is he using again?  No, he was just tense. 
[00:35:00]  That was bizarre.  Very tense.  Because everybody's kind of trashing him for his thing, so he's got to fight back.  So Voss is like, he's not going to get pounded.  He's got to come out swinging.  But no one even trashed him this time.  Jay, here's the problem with Rich Voss.  He comes in here, and he does kill for us.  You know, Jimmy's hitting the road a lot, so we get Rich to sit in Jimmy's seat.  But he'll go on these message boards, and one guy trashes his appearance, and he loses  sleep, and he can't handle it.  He starts starting fights with the guys.  He reads the message boards.  Let me try this.  He starts using the N-word.  There's a black poster that just didn't like him, so he's calling him the N-word and just  losing his mind. 
[00:35:30]  I'm like, Rich, stop reading that.  He's calling a guy nice?  I was jerking off.  I've got high speed at my hotel, so it's just like fucking fantasy land.  Yeah.  And there was a website, Suckin' Nigs, and there was another one called Getting Nigged.  I was like, this is the site for me.  White slave bows to black cock.  She had, like, a slot written on her ass and lipstick, and it was like six black guys,  and the husband was a cuckold hubby.  Cuckold, yeah.  I love that stuff.  You don't see many the other way around, with the white guys and the black chicks. 
[00:36:00]  There's a lot more black guys than white chicks.  That's the site I would open.  Line up, who is?  Yeah, you want that one?  Because I'm the white guy.  You want to see that contrast of a batch all over her ass or something, you know?  That white, dark contrast.  When I was in Miami, I did jerk off to Black and Wild on the internet.  Black and Wild?  What's Black and Wild?  Looks like a wallet, sir.  Exactly.  Big-ass black chicks without condoms, and I was making stomach pancakes all over myself.  I don't give a fuck, Eddie! 
[00:36:30]  Stomach pancakes.  Yeah.  That could be better than the map of Hawaii.  Nothing's better than the map of Hawaii.  I don't know.  Stomach pancakes is good.  No, map of Hawaii is great.  You think it might be, but then when you actually see a map of Hawaii, it comes back to you.  It's like flawless, and it's elocution.  Remember people started making the t-shirts?  Yeah.  The map of Hawaii t-shirts?  Those were the days of I want to hold you, man.  You ever see Rock and Roll Circus?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh.  I thought you said yes.  No, no, no.  With Mick Jagger interviewing John Lennon? 
[00:37:00]  No.  And John Lennon's got a band called Dirty Mac.  It's John Lennon, Keith Richards, Keith Moon, and Eric Clapton.  Jesus.  Really?  Dirty Mac.  And they're just fucking stoned out of their minds.  And he's like, Winston?  He's like, yes.  He calls them some weird name.  And he's like, you did this, you did that.  And John Lennon goes, oh, yeah, those were the days I want to hold you, man.  They're just like retarded high.  And The Who would do a quick one while he's away. 
[00:37:30]  And you've never seen it.  No.  You have to watch it.  I've never even heard of it.  Rock and Roll Circus.  The Stones put it out.  They rented a soundstage, and they had all their friends, like Marian Faithful, Jethro Tull, The Who, and The Stones, and everybody.  And they just did fucking acid, and they just did like a show.  They rented it out for like eight hours.  And everyone in the audience is wearing, like, color-coordinated ponchos.  Like, there's an orange section.  A red section.  And The Stones didn't want it released because they thought they sounded like shit.  But then they released it finally because they sound fucking great.  Really?  And it's a little, like, soundstage. 
[00:38:00]  And The Who do a quick one while he's away.  And it is one of the best live performances.  There's only, like, 60 people there.  And it's just fucking Townsend in the white jumpsuit.  And he, like, he's doing the windmill.  And on the way back, he totally takes out Keith Moon's hi-hat and just fucking, and just looks back like, not my department.  And just keeps playing.  His shit comes untuned, and he tunes it on the fly.  It's bananas performance.  What year would it have done?  Probably 69, 70. 
[00:38:30]  You seen it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, grab the mic.  How great is The Who on that?  Well, I thought the rumor was that they didn't release it because The Who blew the stones out of the water that day.  That would make sense because they certainly did.  Yeah, The Who.  It's fucking, it's bow to Townsend.  If he fucks kids, good for him.  He deserves it.  Just watch that.  Like, you watch that and go, well, let him fuck kids.  Look what he's doing here, though.  Look what he did his whole life.  So he likes a little dibbly-dabbly.  I didn't get a copy of that.  You buy the tower.  Is that his song?  It's a virgin.  And so it's called Rock and Roll Circus? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And The Who only did one song?  The Who only does a quick one while he's away.  Oh, and Yoko, if you don't think Yoko Ono broke up the Beatles, all you gotta do is fucking watch her song.  And she's playing with John Lennon and Eric Clapton and everyone, Mitch Mitchell from Jimi Hendrix Experience.  And she's literally going,  Like, over and over.  And it's like an eight-minute song.  Oh, no.  And you can just feel them rolling their eyes, like, this bitch again. 
[00:39:30]  And if you don't think that had a fucking...  We're musical geniuses and we gotta deal with this shit.  And that's all she does.  And if you don't think that bitch had something to do with breaking up with the Beatles...  Of course she did.  You just imagine her sitting in on those sessions going,  You know what I think with my giant yellow bush?  I'm a flat-faced, yellow, wall-biting monkey.  Expressionless, as you say.  Yes, she really is.  You really opened my eyes to that.  Jimmy, you really opened my eyes to that, how horrible they are. 
[00:40:00]  She's a piece of African artwork.  Dumb fucking perpetual look.  A bunch of wall-biters.  You really opened my eyes when you said they were expressionless.  And now I got my girlfriend to hate them, too.  She goes, did you see them?  We'll be at, like, a fancy hotel.  And we'll be walking through the courtyard.  She'll be like, did you see them?  Dude, I was in the...  I'm like, yeah, I saw them.  They're gross.  I was in the park yesterday.  And I agree with you.  I've never saw it.  Go ahead.  Go, go, go, go.  I've never had an Asian prostitute do anything but go, giggle, giggle, giggle. 
[00:40:30]  Fucking...  I'm going to take it, you...  They just lay there and pay off their slavery ship debt.  It's like, could you at least make eye contact, you fucking awful actor?  I had a Puerto Rican one, and I swear to God, I thought she was in love with me.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, kissing me on the net.  Like, God damn, I gotta fuck Puerto Ricans, apparently.  She's like, hey, papi, I said, don't even fucking speak English to me the whole time you're in here.  She goes, hi there, but I go, but how do I know you're not making fun of me?  It doesn't matter.  It matters to me, because I'll fucking punch her in the mouth. 
[00:41:00]  So she...  Dude, I got one hooker.  She's a girl who...  She charged me, like, less than 200 bucks for full service.  I went to Craigslist, and I got a bargain.  Dude.  She's not a hooker.  She's hunting online.  She's a fucking...  She's a professional person who's, like, exercising this weird demon.  She makes real money.  And I banged her without a bag, and I kissed her.  I've never kissed anybody.  Like, I kissed this girl for money.  It was the hottest sex I've ever had.  Really?  I would have came at her and knocked her up.  I would have knocked her up.  How long ago was this?  I don't know. 
[00:41:30]  Look at how I'm fucking filling up.  Look at you.  She was amazing.  You without a bag, and she's a hooker?  No bag.  I laugh at bags.  Me too.  Put that on.  That's called the intimacy blocker.  And what...  Did you unleash in her?  No, I didn't do that.  Why not?  I don't know, because the first time she wouldn't let me do it, she's like, you can't put it  in without a condom.  I knew she wanted me to, because she was soaked.  It was like that thing where, like, the lips have a piece trailing to the thigh.  Like that fucking, like that drooly retard mouth box.  There's nothing hotter than that. 
[00:42:00]  She looked like a punched, tear-stained retard mouth.  That's what a fucking vagina should look like.  I'm with you.  I like the big lips.  Is that like a brown toe every once in a while?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ever seen Mike Goes to Brazil?  No.  That's a great sight.  Guy goes to Brazil, and he fucks chicks, and you get to free demos.  Oh, no.  Mike Goes to Brazil.  Mike Goes to Brazil.  Learning about a lot of good websites.  It's not a best-selling book like Gasping for Airtime, L.A. Times bestseller by Jane Moore.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, the bestseller.  All right.  Let's put that in the books. 
[00:42:30]  Three and a half hours, first plug.  You know, if you guys were on the air, Rich Voss would have won Les Comic Standing, and  my book would still be on the bestseller list.  Yeah, he would have won without a doubt.  Look at Kelly Ripa.  I want her to sit on my fucking face, and I'll tell her how much her husband cheats on her.  Really?  Oh, look at that little box she must have.  Just rub it back and forth.  She looks like she might have a brown toe.  What's a brown toe?  Brown pussy lips.  Oh, okay.  I don't mind those.  Hey, let me ask you something.  I love them.  Why aren't you hosting that show anymore when he goes away, Regis? 
[00:43:00]  They didn't ask me.  Because you did a great job with her.  You guys had a great chemistry.  I think they were a little nervous.  I think they got a little nervous with Jay.  Why?  I think so, too.  Jay was a little bit too, like, I don't know, cutting edge.  No, dude.  I was G, G, G rated.  Yeah, but even your G rated is a little out there for the audience.  We only had Kelly Rip on the show once, and it was just one of those horrific days where  we were just way in the gutter.  Here's a perfect example of why they may not ask Jay back, because this is a show he's  co-hosted.  He goes, oh, what a box. 
[00:43:30]  I bet you she has a brown toe on a national radio show.  That's how I roll a little, Jimmy.  I love it, dude.  No one's really listening to the show yet, though.  Hey, uh, well, I was going to ask you something that you said on the air.  You're fat.  Did he really get so disgusted with Ron Steiger?  He just said, oh, Charlie.  Oh, Charlie, you're fucking terrible.  What an awful actor.  Oh, no, it was, oh, Charlie.  What?  Oh, I was going to ask you something, Jimmy.  Oh, Monster Rain.  I never heard the whole story. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  Oh, it's cute.  You went under the porch to, like, jerk each other off because it was going to rain?  No, jerk each other.  What are we, fucking communists?  No.  You think he's a beginner?  You think he's a beginner?  No, it's an American free country, but when you're in my cab, no breaking heads.  No, we would just do a little, uh...  But what's Monster Rain at the end?  We were very, well, again, logical question.  We were very young, we were five or six, and I guess we would have the desire to kiss  each other, you know, on the dingles, and one of us would say, Monster Rain, and that 
[00:44:30]  was the excuse to get under the porch.  Right.  Looking back, I suspect there was no real rain.  There was no rain, no monsters.  Maybe a dark cloud.  You guys ever blew a kid when you were young?  No.  I did.  How about now?  No.  Well.  Quick, puppy's sick.  Uh-oh.  Wow, that's a good tone for the radio, Jim.  A Jay Moore fart.  Smells like Billy Hayes.  Well, that guy's got a death funk.  All right, why don't we take a break and regroup here? 
[00:45:00]  We've been talking an hour.  Ooh.  Jay, how cool is this satellite radio?  You don't have to stop for 20-minute breaks.  All right, don't make a big fucking thing out of it.  You're going to make me think what I did over here.  That's the guy that shot the cop.  What happened?  Looks like John Starks in the playoffs.  Wow.  He shot the cop and they, uh...  I can't believe it!  Oh, my baby!  Oh, my baby!  Oh, my baby!  What's wrong with his face?  This is a guy from Rhode Island.  What he did was he shot a cop and, um...  The cops came to arrest him.  And Jay Moore... 
[00:45:30]  And apparently he somehow fell out the window and landed on his face.  You know, that happens.  They fucking...  Because he was being...  He wasn't even under arrest.  He was being questioned for something,  which was not as serious as the capital murder of a police officer at a station.  Well, he's an animal.  What are you thinking?  He's a freaking animal.  What the fuck was Joe thinking?  What is he thinking?  It's totally turned into a goddamn shooting gallery.  Bang! 
[00:46:00]  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Oh, we got clips.  Yeah, we got clips of this.  So, what's the setup again?  Well, apparently this guy...  I like how Ope writes it down, holds it across the studio for Ant to read it.  Ant chugs his shoulders.  I don't know what that says.  Ope does one of these, like, read here, stupid.  And then Ant goes...  Ant whispers, I still don't know what that is.  And Ope goes, okay, we have clips here.  I'll just read this myself.  And I go, we have clips.  Honestly, the only reason, I don't really know this story.  I got the clips in front of me, but I don't really know the setup here.  What happened?  Well, the guy was being questioned for a crime. 
[00:46:30]  And the cop that was questioning him, the black guy, took his gun and shot him.  And then the cops came up to arrest him for this shooting.  And, well, they say he jumped out the window.  And I guess there's another story that perhaps he was pushed out the window.  Or that he did jump out the window, but that wasn't what did the damage to his face like that.  Because the guy is completely fucked up.  Wait, when did he shoot the cop? 
[00:47:00]  Before or after he left the window?  Before.  I think before, yeah.  So then what the fuck are we arguing about?  What's the problem?  We're arguing about it.  I said to wait.  So what?  They tune him up a little bit.  Oh, I ask Kimmy's got more sense than you.  If I shoot the cop, I lose $15,000?  I'm lucky to get down to $150,000.  Stop eating, you fat fuck.  You're like a fucking nut.  Do a little less eating and a little more fucking, you wouldn't be such a fucking nut.  Jesus Christ, you always had a fucking number on you, you know that?  Here's the first clip. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, the clip, I think we have some clips of the family of this.  Yeah, here's the family freaking out.  Is he black?  I thought he was Spanish.  He looked black all the way up.  He looks like John Starks with that mask on.  He really is a mess.  A bad incident, unrecognizable Esteban Carpio limps into the courtroom.  Esteban.  His family loses it.  Oh, my God.  The 26-year-old is accused of shooting a Providence police detective to death.  Today, more than 24 hours after his arrest, he's barely able to talk. 
[00:48:00]  His face bloody and bruised.  His eyes nearly swollen shut.  A plastic mask covering most of his face.  His hysterical relatives are yanked out of court.  He shot a cop.  Well, they're yelling, not guilty, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Not guilty!  Not guilty!  They're all upset that he's beat up.  How about a cop that's dead?  His family that has now a dead father. 
[00:48:30]  His name was Esteban.  Esteban.  Is that the guy that plays guitar on public access TV?  Oh, my God.  You see the infomercial?  Oh, he's a creepy fucking guy.  You got the Esteban guitar?  He's a creepy fucking guy.  I sat through an entire infomercial.  For some reason, you just can't turn it off.  It's like the Dean Martin show infomercial.  Yeah.  You just get your money.  You get your money's worth just watching the commercial.  Gotta watch it.  Yeah.  I'm not going to order because all the good parts are in the commercial.  What's wrong with this guy's family?  If I shot a cop, my dad would be...  They wouldn't even go to court.  Yeah.  These people are like, oh, that's big... 
[00:49:00]  I'm trying not to get, you know...  I got to almost speak in defense of the family.  It's got to be a shock when...  Stop blinking, you creep.  I can't help myself.  Holy moly.  I blink.  It's what I do.  It's like you're flying into a bug light.  I can't help.  You're blinking a lot lately.  I do.  I blink a lot.  That's what I talk more.  But lately, you're blinking more than usual.  It ramps...  No, I'm not.  Is it when you get all worked up?  Yeah, when I get ramped up.  All right, go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I forgot what I was going to say now.  Oh, no, I remember. 
[00:49:30]  In defense of the family, it's, you know...  In one moment, your person is being questioned.  And the next minute, he's beaten up and accused of killing a cop.  It's just got to throw you for a loop.  I can't blame the family for freaking out.  Look, the Puerto...  His name's Esteban, the Puerto Rican.  It's not like this is a whole new thing to the family.  Somebody's shooting a cop.  The guy's questioning this guy.  The detective.  He gets shot with his own gun.  And he was questioning this guy.  Guilty.  The guy should be...  The guy should be executed.  The guy should be executed.  Where it was somebody else, and they're setting him up, and it's an old involved plot. 
[00:50:00]  The guy killed the guy.  But as a society, we put him in that position because we don't have enough social programs.  It was Tom Selleck holding a hairdryer at the end.  Wait a minute.  What movie was that?  I don't know.  It was good.  By the way, I saw Tom Selleck at the Emmys.  He's the best-looking fucking human being I've ever seen in my life.  Still, really?  It was ridiculous.  Yeah.  It was ridiculous.  And I saw Carl Malone in San Diego at Rockin' the Corps for the Marines.  Yeah.  And it was like, that was the only time in my life I've been starstruck. 
[00:50:30]  Was Malone?  Carl Malone?  A balding guy with an 18-wheeler?  There's a lot more famous people you've met.  How about Nicholson?  Do you give a fuck about Nicholson?  Yeah, she did.  Really?  He was fucking McMurphy.  I fucked his girlfriend.  What do I care?  Did you?  Yeah.  Oh.  Now you're going to tell us all.  Oh, no.  You're going to get into it.  All right.  Here's Seth from Boston.  Seth.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Go ahead.  Yeah, he was being questioned for the stabbing murder of an 84-year-old lady.  Oh.  There you go. 
[00:51:00]  In the police house.  They don't know how, but he got the cop's gun from him and shot him, jumped out a third  story window down to the ground, and then the FBI, local police, and state police were  chasing him, and they only described it as a violent struggle before they showed pictures  of him leading into the courthouse.  A violent struggle.  Man, they just pounded his face.  I just say, thank God there was no smart-ass do-gooder with a video camera around to videotape 
[00:51:30]  the beating that they threw this animal.  I'd be the worst cop in the world.  I would be so bad, Lieutenant.  As soon as a guy got handcuffed, I would just pump.  What did you say about my mother?  I'd spin on him.  I'd punch.  I'd make him open his mouth and spin on it, and then I'd probably come.  I watch episodes of cops, and you watch the guy running from the cops and a car chase.  They get him out.  He tries to run again, and then they get him by the neck and throw him on the ground, and  I'm sitting there going, punch him!  Beat him!  Hit him with a stick! 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Like, I can't, and this is just somebody running.  A friend of mine just quit being a cop in Jersey, and he moved to California, and I said, why?  And he said, everywhere you go, everyone hates you on sight.  And he said, and I can't live my life that way.  How do you do that?  He's just like a normal kid, good guy.  Like, he wasn't like a dropout that became a cop.  He just said, you just drive down the street, and people go, look at this asshole.  You just show up, and the party stops everywhere you go.  He said, I couldn't do it.  And you try to do your job, and there's always people there that are saying that you're, you 
[00:52:30]  know, police brutality.  It's nice you guys brought in the sketch artist.  Unnecessary force.  Oh, yeah, Laszlo.  That's Laszlo.  Laszlo.  Oh, yeah.  Gonna do a little tech talk.  All right.  Laszlo, you hear him on Grand Theft Auto, the video game.  Right.  Yeah.  You play Grand Theft, Jay?  No, because the first time they ever had it, they had the two discs.  They had one that was for the British James Bond car, but you had to finish the American  one first.  Really?  Wow, you go way back in the game.  The first one ever, and I finished the first one.  There was nothing else to do, and that game said, keep driving. 
[00:53:00]  There's more work to be done, and I kept that fucking thing on for two days straight.  When I left my apartment, I hit pause.  I'd come back.  I'd keep playing.  I shot everything.  I fucked it.  I drove it.  I ran it over.  And, you know, you memorized the city by that point.  Nothing, I said.  I think there was, like, a glitch in that disc.  You got to get the new one.  Yeah, the new San Andreas.  It's all home.  No, I don't!  Well, I got to play the next clip here.  Yeah, let me hear the next clip.  The more clip soap?  Who is this? 
[00:53:30]  Not guilty!  The family just losing.  Another family member just losing it here.  They're massacred!  They massacred him!  I'm surprised he's still alive, the way he looks.  Initially, when we went to the hospital, we talked to the police.  They said he only had a leg injury.  It's a minor laceration.  They wouldn't let us see him.  We're seeing him now.  His whole face is just massacred.  Yeah, good!  That's terrific!  That's terrific!  Good!  They massacred him. 
[00:54:00]  Your animal fucking relative is a cop killer?  Ugh!  They massacred him!  No, he massacred a cop.  How do you get the cop?  Like, that's a bad day at the office when someone takes a con.  That's someone getting laxadaisical.  That's someone screwing up.  That's like real...  Like, that never happens.  Yeah.  Especially if it just happened in Atlanta.  I mean, it's like, you're not fucking...  What are you doing?  You're not cupping the animal to the chair.  Why do you curse so much, dude?  Do it when you're friends.  That's all.  I don't like it.  Well, you know, I'm just not the type of girl you just take out and bang.  You fucking? 
[00:54:30]  No.  Joey.  I always tell you the truth.  Ask me one time, I always tell you.  You don't have to ask me again.  I tried the fuck.  I don't try the fuck anything.  One more clip, Anthony.  This should have taken two minutes, not 15.  Of course.  But it's okay.  I don't know what this one's about.  We should be back on premium with this show.  Nice.  Language, young man.  This is my home.  This is a solid show today.  Police say that Carpio was injured when he fell from that third floor window at police 
[00:55:00]  headquarters, and they also say here in court that he, quote, violently resisted arrest.  There you go.  They grabbed him by the fucking back and said, you fucking chimp, and threw him out the window.  They threw him out the window.  Threw him out the window.  I don't blame him a bit, and he probably landed on his face, and they kicked it some more.  And just pound him in his face.  Good.  Shoot a cop.  Very good.  Yeah, like all these people, like Free Mamiya.  It's like the guy, he shot a cop.  Yeah.  All these do-gooders.  Remember the Free James Brown shirts?  Yep. 
[00:55:30]  James Brown kidnapped someone and went on a five-state chase, and then when he ran out of gas,  he shot a shotgun at police vehicles.  But you enjoy his music, so free him.  I'd like to make the 60-year-old man very happy.  What about the do-gooder that, the peace nick, as they called him in one of the papers, that  had a home invasion on the...  Home invasion fantasy?  Home invasion yesterday, which Opie is a little concerned about.  It might be connected to what happened with me.  Might be connected.  There might be a connection there. 
[00:56:00]  Where is that argument?  Well, what about that guy?  Give me that there.  Well, let me read it.  He's some do-gooder.  Remember, I was talking about the pizza delivery guy, what, Sunday night at 11.30, trying to,  you know, talk me into opening the front door with a pizza that I didn't order.  And I got a little...  That would have been great.  I can't wait for something like that to happen to me.  I got a little paranoid, because the guy...  Free pizza?  The guy was very aggressive, and he just wanted me to open that last door, and I didn't go  for it.  Four doors they have, right?  Yeah.  They got to get through four doors, and he left one door. 
[00:56:30]  Between me and him.  Between you and this guy.  And the guy's like, you ordered the pizza.  Come on, open the door.  And he's showing me, like, the address on the pizza box.  Oh, I guess it is my pizza.  I didn't order any pizza.  I didn't order that.  Well, here's the thing really fast.  Like, I was in bed for at least three hours, so I was a little woozy.  A little woozy.  If I was wide awake, I would have...  Oh, hello there.  I would have understood the situation, but I was a little woozy from being in bed for three  hours.  Woozy.  Oh.  Oh.  So, uh... 
[00:57:00]  Go to the Slauson cutoff.  Get out of your car.  Cut off your Slauson.  Get back in the car.  The 110 to the 10 to the 210 to the 605.  You get to the fork in the road.  Dude, no joke, though.  I think I'm going to have to talk to the NYPD today.  Really?  Because now they've got a sketch of the guy, and I'm telling you, this guy looks...  Dude, you're going to have to talk to the cops, then.  I'm not even kidding.  Because this is...  Are you sure it wasn't your home invasion fantasy that...  This guy was very aggressive with the pizza from Domino's, saying that I ordered this  pizza at 1130 at night.  But open...  And wouldn't take no for an answer. 
[00:57:30]  Mm-hmm.  And conveniently, he wasn't using the talkback with the intercom thing there.  Right.  So I had to go outside to see what the hell was going on, because he kept buzzing and  buzzing and buzzing.  So he's waiting for you.  And did he say, open the door or something?  Did he tap on the door?  What was he doing?  He was like, no, come on, this is your pizza, you know, whatever.  Something like that.  Hoping you were going to open it up, and then he'd go, get in the apartment, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Well, Domino's, dude.  He's smart, though, because it's not breaking and entering, because you let him in three  doors.  I don't know.  Yeah, but if you pipe somebody over the head and rob him, you can't go, well, technically,  he opens...  That's a vampire rule.  Well... 
[00:58:00]  You have to be invited into the house.  Vampire rule.  But with these savages, it doesn't really matter.  Well, I told this story yesterday, if you guys were listening.  Well, in today's paper...  They work here.  They're probably listening.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, he's talking about the audience, I guess.  The home audience.  You know what?  I forget there's even people out there.  I have such a good time, I forget we're entertaining.  I do.  I feel like I'm wearing just a little hat with two ear things.  That's the beauty of this show.  This is why they say everything about it is appealing.  Roll in.  No makeup.  Oh, it's one of the cappuccino.  Go ahead, Bubby. 
[00:58:30]  Yesterday, you were saying...  I just turned the mics on, and that's that.  Well, the story gets a little more interesting here, because the headline reads,  Man Shot in Home Invasion, and the guy that was shot was a peacenik.  Listen to this.  The grad student shot in Home Invasion horror on the Upper West Side is a peace activist  who hails from blah, blah, blah.  Keith, a 24-year-old philosophy student at the New...  Philosophy student.  At the New School is battling lung and stomach wounds at the hospital after Sunday's... 
[00:59:00]  Same day as Milo Weird Thing.  Sunday's vicious attack.  What time was his attack?  I would love to know.  That's what I...  Wait, so that pizza man got shot up.  What did he...  I'm confused.  Well, see, you weren't listening yesterday, but basically this whole pizza thing...  Honestly, I wasn't just listening right now.  I was looking at the TV, so just throw it over for me.  No, he can't throw it over for you.  No, he...  It's not about you.  He shot the guy or stabbed him, or...  He ended up shooting him.  Well, this is where it gets good.  He was shot in front of his terrified fiancee after a thug followed her into their building  on West 108th Street and pushed his way into the apartment demanding cash. 
[00:59:30]  This is where the guy got stupid, and it's just like that other case about two, three months  ago.  After robbing...  And here's also somebody...  They followed her in.  Here's somebody not wanting to be politically incorrect.  You see a strange black man following you into your building.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Following you into...  How do you get in three doors if he's black?  Into your...  Followed her into the building.  No, what...  She says nothing about it.  No, some idiot leaves one of the doors unlocked to begin with.  So one down right there. 
[01:00:00]  You look on the monitor, like channel six, the surveillance cam, you're like, oh, there's  a random black guy downstairs.  I better buzz him in.  Yeah.  They just leave the front one unlocked, because it's a hassle, you know?  He must be here to work on someone's computer.  This woman, if she's being...  Nothing.  ...followed...  It was pretty good.  Nothing.  It was pretty good.  It's all right.  All right.  If she's being followed...  I was hitting for average, not power.  I'll take a single.  That was a base hit up the metal block.  I legged it out.  You did.  Legged it out.  Hustle.  Juan Pierre style.  Go ahead.  She wasn't paying attention, or she was too politically correct to go, I got some kind of feeling 
[01:00:30]  here.  Or she had a black guy home invasion fantasy where he pins her down and fucks the shit  out of her, and shoots her, stabs her fucking dead...  I don't know.  Go ahead.  Well, what happened is, the guy breaks in, he robs the couple.  Well, I'm just getting to that.  Oh.  Way to go, Jim.  All right, yeah, so this thug followed her into their building on West 108th Street  and pushed his way into the apartment to mend a cash.  Okay. 
[01:01:00]  After robbing the pair, the burglar appeared to linger, prompting the dude, the peace activist  there, to ask, are you ready for this, kids?  Are you going to shoot me now?  Well, what's with these idiots asking to be shot?  The thug then pumped three bullets into him.  Of course, you ask.  Do you know what the thug said to him, too?  This is the line he used.  He said, ah, you're some kind of wisecrack.  Really?  He called him like some kind of a fucking, like, 1950s remark.  He said, you're a wisecrack.  Did he say a wisecrack? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Did he call him a wiseenheimer?  Wisecrack?  Yes.  You're wisecracking?  Do you want to share with the room, Billy, or?  I mean.  I'll just send them on an errand.  Sorry.  I hear a whole thing.  No.  No.  I was eavesdropping, but I couldn't really hear what you guys were talking about.  There's nothing going on.  Chop, chop.  Chop, chop.  Nothing going on.  It's innocent.  This is innocent.  We're just having an egg sandwich.  Joey, you got it all wrong.  What?  Whose turn is it?  Oh, okay.  That's what it was.  It was my turn? 
[01:02:00]  He said, there's some kind of wisecrack.  Wisecrack.  All right.  And then he shoots him.  So, yeah, the guy goes,  Are you going to shoot me now?  And the thug then pumped three bolts into the guy.  Well, the guy, because the guy was lingering.  Lingering.  Yeah, linger longer.  The criminal was lingering, and then he pumped him full of lead.  But that was, what a doodle.  Bone dry.  That was the same night of my weird experience,  and it was probably less than a mile from, you know, my abode.  And the sketch in the paper looks, well, how can you tell? 
[01:02:30]  I mean, let's be honest.  Why do you think they're so specific with the clothing?  I have a question, though.  Yeah, like the guy's going to walk around for the next five days with the same clothing.  I love that one.  I love that one.  That's right.  Well, these idiots, too.  I wanted to know if the grease man knew any retarded people in school.  I don't remember if he did.  Well, if they might have some...  What?  I just thought the grease man might have known some retarded people that had odd names that begin with D. 
[01:03:00]  I just thought he might have.  I just don't remember.  Yes, in school I knew a kid there named Dally Dooley.  Dally the Dooley.  He was a retard that picked his nose there.  He was flinging boogers.  Dally Dooley Waddle Doo Doodle.  I had to hear a retard say Dally Dooley.  Dally Dooley on the grease man show.  And grease manelli wouldn't take a home invasion.  I'd pull out my shotgun and blast him in the face. 
[01:03:30]  I'd be slinging my own lead there.  Now these words from Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Then have a bone dry to celebrate.  Bone dry.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Jay Moore in studio.  Oh, they beat this guy's ass.  Having a lot of fun today.  Good.  Well, he's garbage.  Fuck him.  Esteban Carpio.  It's amazing how bloody and swollen his eyes...  You know what?  They're only putting the mask on.  They probably don't want the public to see his face.  He has no jaw, probably.  That's the good part.  Yeah, they left uncovered the good parts. 
[01:04:00]  And those look horrific.  What was their excuse for medical reasons?  But you know they just didn't want to march him in a court.  With no jaw.  I bet his teeth are gone.  Teeth?  The entire bottom part of his face is shattered off.  They hit me and beat me.  My teeth.  I thought you were doing the grease man at first.  One, two, three.  I was very injured.  I fell out a window.  They beat me mercilessly.  Well, we got to dump and stuff, so. 
[01:04:30]  Dump.  I want to thank Jay Moore, who will be at Caroline's tonight.  And you can listen to him on the Opie and Anthony show.  See, I've been going all the way back.  Let's call the boss back when we come back.  Yeah, let's see how his situation's going.  I'm still waiting for another flight.  Now I have to go do Houston.  I never thought it.  That was a great call.  The guy's sitting at an airport and he keeps saying bombing.  I'm bombing.  I know.  And we got to play the Howard Stern thing again.  Hey, guys, I have a funny idea.  What, the one about me?  Oh, Jimmy.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[01:05:00]  I don't know what you want to say.  He's a cock.  I have a really funny idea.  Maybe we could all do the show.  We could all put on the XM Wow hats and all wear the same hat and do the show.  Oh, that'd be cute.  Yeah, it'd be funny, right?  I'd say we all just smoke weed.  Yeah.  Who's carrying?  Hey, Ben.  I got some in my hotel.  Hello.  Yeah?  Yeah, it looks good.  I've been talking about this.  I want to start smoking weed again.  Come on, we're after this.  Belt of Scotch from Wackbag says, Dally Dooley would have set up that bit better than Norton  just did.  I know.  That's what I like.  Well, that was kind of the, this is what the silly goose said. 
[01:05:30]  That was kind of supposed to be the way it was.  I love how we sometimes just throw things at Anthony and he has to kind of try to,  I don't know, try to find it in the air somewhere.  Oh, here it goes.  It's the setup.  I'm panicking.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Dally Dooley.  Well, me and Ant last week talked about it.  It was, I thought the Dally Dooley.  I was like, oh, God, I want to hear the Chris man say that.  And we laughed and we talked and he goes, I know, I thought that.  And I'm like, yeah, no, me too.  Last week.  I wasn't on Vicodin last week.  When you guys had to set up Regan and all his bits, that was so, I felt bad for the guy. 
[01:06:00]  Brian, you ever do a school project?  Go.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was our old bit where we would just awkwardly, you know, set him up.  He's not working anymore.  I love when you do the question that's not a question.  Yeah, it's just to be silly.  My girl likes that the most.  I couldn't do it.  It's her favorite part of the show.  Oh, really?  Little questions?  All right, as we go to break here.  The pop tart.  I've been trying to go to break for a while.  Oh, and Serena Williams.  I met Brett Ratner at the airport in L.A.  He's been directed like Rush Hour.  He's the guy banging Serena Williams. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, wow.  She knows about me wanting to fuck her so bad because he talked to me about it.  Serena Williams?  Really?  Nice.  He goes, hey, I go, you son of a bitch.  Not any chance, though, right?  What?  Not any chance of that, though.  I don't know.  Jay's got a personality thing women tend to go for.  Maybe.  What am I, ugly?  No, but I mean, please, you're not Serena Williams good-looking.  You're all right.  You're not an athlete.  You're a decent-looking guy.  She fucks Brett Ratner.  But that's what I'm saying.  With a girl, she's a fucking athlete.  She could bang an NBA or anybody. 
[01:07:00]  You've got a certain personality thing.  No, no, I know what you're saying.  You think he's a good-looking guy.  You've got to be careful what you say these days.  That's all.  No, he knows what he said.  I just want to make sure I'm not kissing that King Cole over here.  I'm quite fine.  No, you could totally see how White Cole could fall for him.  And she's such a...  What?  She's such a dumb audience member.  She says, you know, the impersonations.  You would think he was the real person.  The real person.  Impersonations.  The best one-syllable maybe in cinema history.  What? 
[01:07:30]  Easy.  Easy.  Easy.  I'm easy.  I want to make sure I'm not kissing that King Cole.  I suck the cock.  All right, as we go to...  Jay Hattano.  You were stealing my act on 018 the other day.  We're taking a break.  Opie, let's take a break.  I want to get into that men's room.  Yeah, well...  I've got to take a dump, too.  Jay, we've got the greatest thing here.  You know, Howard signed with Sirius for like a half a billion dollars.  Him and Brewer?  But we got a commercial of him talking about XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:08:00]  Selling it like it's the greatest thing ever.  Yep.  And he will...  We've been playing this over and over again, and this fucking pussy...  He's not the old Howard.  He's just sitting there...  He's horrible.  He's sitting there just taking it.  He's the worst, but like Robin's become like the worst, worst ever.  He knows he can't fight this game, so he's just sitting there and taking it.  And you've got to think his new boss there, which is his old boss, Mel, is not very happy  that there's an XM Satellite Radio commercial out there. 
[01:08:30]  Mel going out to the Hamptons this weekend, Mel.  He had Doug Stanhope on last week.  Really?  I was like...  And Ant.  Ant was bad-mouthing me on Howard.  And I told him...  Somebody told me, I go, Ant was bad-mouthing you on Howard.  I go, you know what I take from that conversation?  Howard had on Ant.  Ant.  Like, that supersedes me being bad-mout.  Right.  Like, that was your guest, Doug Stanhope and Ant.  And chill out.  We're not setting the world on fire with our guests on this show.  Well, Stanhope...  You guys are like... 
[01:09:00]  We had Spalding on the other day.  I mean, that was our big guest last week.  That is a great guest.  Who?  I don't care.  We had Spalding from Caddyshack.  Spalding.  Nice.  Great.  That is great.  Who doesn't love Spalding?  But you guys are like Classic Carson.  You can have the Potato Chip Lady on.  It doesn't matter, you're so good at what you do.  Couple of fags, couple of beautiful ghosts.  Smoking grass.  Suck a cock.  Look at him like two fags.  Hey, take it easy.  Maybe?  Yeah.  All right.  Stanhope called me, actually. 
[01:09:30]  Because, you know, Yoshi's the fucking best networker ever.  He's trying to get him on the show.  So I haven't talked to Doug in a long time.  He called me today.  He's like, yeah, man.  I was...  You know, Yoshi wanted me to call me Opie Anthony.  He's like, do you think he's like with Howard?  Is there a problem with that?  Because he's L.A.  Who's Yoshi?  He's a comedian.  He's a good friend of mine.  You need to know Yoshi.  It was like a coke binge conversation just then.  Dude, he's a...  That's Yoshi.  He does all the DVDs for Evil Angel, so he gets porn.  Dude, we get a stack of porn like once every two weeks.  All right, so Yoshi and...  Yoshi was saying he got Doug to call, and I didn't talk to Doug in a long time. 
[01:10:00]  He's like, well, Howard have a problem with it.  Like, he doesn't...  He's like, yeah, because Stern's been pretty good to me.  I don't want to...  I'm like, dude, I don't know.  Opie Anthony...  Oh, Howard would certainly have a problem.  Of course he would.  We've never played that game.  Howard plays that game.  I said, I don't want to never tell an artist where to go.  You go wherever you want to go, man.  No one in this show gives a fuck, but over there, it might be a different story.  So, whatever.  That's that.  I just wanted to update everyone.  All right, well, with that...  All right, well, with that, here's Howard Stern talking about XM Satellite Radio.  This is...  I love this thing.  Cock.  I can't get enough of this thing.  If you're planning a road trip this week, and it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along 
[01:10:30]  for the ride, XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands.  You know what's great about this?  He is fuming, but the company, you know, Infinity Broadcast, and they're not going to stop us.  They hate him.  Because they hate him, too.  They hate him.  So, we have free reign here.  The only thing he could do is, like, you know, fight back, and he's just not going to do it.  Smoke some grass, suck a cock.  I'm going to laugh at that all day.  He smokes Kit Kat Club?  Is that what he said? 
[01:11:00]  What are you talking about, Kit Kat Club, smoke some grass?  I know what you did.  See, the old days, you know, we would do stuff like this.  Can't you just give us a warning?  Maybe.  And instead of fighting back, he'd go behind the scenes and make us shut up.  Right.  But now he's just got to take it.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for  the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family. 
[01:11:30]  Including the biggest games in news, sports, talk, and comedy.  All in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  No wonder.  XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  He sounds like such a fag.  This will be a free home kit, so you can connect XM to any home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM. 
[01:12:00]  Beyond FM.  It's XM Satellite Radio.  And that's like the most serious read I've ever heard him do.  Oh, he's working it.  Let me tell you about Snapple, Robin.  Snapple.  Woo-hoo.  Woo-hoo.  Woo-hoo.  He's working it.  He's selling it.  When I'm not drinking a Seabreeze out in Hampton, Robin, I drink Snapple.  Woo-hoo Snapple.  You know, you get a tail light out?  License and registration.  Can't...  It's our father's car. 
[01:12:30]  Huh?  It's our dad.  Yeah, can't you, like, just let us go with a warning?  Maybe.  What were you tonight?  Kit Kat clubs?  Smoked some grass?  Huh?  I know what you did.  Come beautiful girls.  How would your daddy feel if he knew you were out here driving his car?  How would you feel about that?  Look, you can't arrest us.  Oh, no?  How would your daddy feel if he had to come pick you up?  Come beautiful girls. 
[01:13:00]  Goddamn.  I can't tell I've got Colin Quinn.  They're very similar.  Come beautiful girls.  You ever suck a cock?  Don't talk back to me.  I'll take you in.  Women get raped every day.  Now because this one wears a penguin suit, they put up a big reward.  The church is a racket.  Are you a Catholic?  I'm a Catholic.  I'm blessed.  I've been dodging bullets since I was 15.  This guy will blow up your fucking house with your family in it. 
[01:13:30]  Good.  You'll be doing me a fucking favor.  Good eyes, Daniels.  Two and one to Cal Daniels.  Good eyes.  Good eyes, Daniels.  Good eyes.  Eyes, eyes, eyes.  Who's going to be okay?  I cross movies there.  You nigger guns on that!  Bah, bah, whip, whip, whip, whip.  Holy shit.  Who's going to...  Excuse me, are you a doctor? 
[01:14:00]  And you admit that your medical opinion means nothing.  Whose laugh is that?  Oh, Howard.  Howard.  Is that Robert's laugh?  Isolated?  Now we can do whatever the hell we want.  It's like a Wallace, sir.  Nobody does Keitel.  You know how happy that makes me?  That's awesome.  If we could just get in touch with Joe, Joe will make it right.  Look, you shot in the gut. 
[01:14:30]  It hurts bed.  But you don't die from your wounds.  It takes days.  You're going to wish you were dead.  I like in Last Temptation of Christ when he doesn't get rid of his accent.  Jesus, you asked me to betray you.  I did this for you, you motherfucker.  Honey, why does Judas have his cock up? 
[01:15:00]  I think Judas had a raw deal historically.  And Pilate also.  We'll talk about that when we come back.  Oh, I know all about Pilate.  Opie and Anthony on XM Radio.  We'll be back.  Rumor has it that Pontius Pilate's wife was a big disciple of Jesus and didn't want him killed.  That's just what I hear.  Pontius didn't want him killed.  Let's talk about it when we come back.  Okay, okay, no, no, no, I know, I know, I know.  Let's tease it, let's tease it, let's tease it.  Okay, well, no, Jimmy is taking us to commercial today.  Oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  All right, we're going to do this thing when we get back, but first we've got to... 
[01:15:30]  This channel is experiencing technical difficulties.  Please stand by.  We're working on the problem.  Technical difficulties.  Probably just faulty equipment.  Or Ben's hog hit the circuit breaker and tripped it.  Steve poured a martini in the mixing board.  Or Hulk's breath burnt through the transmission cord.  Sandy Kane blocked the sky with Twado.  Or Bob Kelly vomited all over the console.  Or Howard Stern bought XM for half a billion.  Or Pat from Unaki drove his van through the building.  What's the meaning?  The scene-free messages are repeating. 
[01:16:00]  The only way to fix it is a corporate meeting.  And Opie's not around, he's rollerblading in the park.  And Professor Anthony can't even get it to start.  It's taking forever.  I hope it don't last long.  They stalk her patty-crawling with a crusty mask on.  Or maybe Danny told Ricky to stop the show.  Or Opie threw a chocolate strawberry at ELO.  The Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Jay Moore in the studio.  That was really enjoyable, Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  We were sitting here listening to that.  Yeah, that was just the beginning, though.  There's a part two.  Part D.  Jay Moore, when Laszlo was in studio.  Right, Laszlo was in here.  Guys, I'm going to go get an English muffin, okay?  You're going to take off?  Yeah.  All right.  You're leaving?  I'm going to go.  I just got to get some jelly.  Will you be back for Jay Moore in studio part three?  You know what?  I heard the lines down there really long.  Okay.  BillBurr.com?  Yes.  I remember the days that you didn't think you were too important. 
[01:17:00]  Then you could sit in through these things.  I got something to do at 12 last Tuesday.  Oh, wow.  And I can't if I'm late for that.  Yeah, what did you have to do?  Because that was last Tuesday.  Oh, you know what I was trying to do?  I was trying to give this packet to this lady for this commission.  How'd it go?  I don't know, man.  It's weird.  It's like still up in the air right now.  Really?  Yeah, it's crazy.  I bet.  I'm just hoping it all turns out.  All right.  By noon on Tuesday.  Did you make it?  I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  It was weird.  It was like I was feeling like I was getting out of there.  But then people just started asking me these questions.  I didn't want to be rude, so I kept hanging around answering them.  So you weren't quite sure what time you would get out of there.  Yeah, but today's a great day.  Tuesday was a rough one.  That sounds it.  It's crazy.  All right.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll let you go.  Take off your headphones and walk out awkwardly.  Okay.  It's not like we'll be talking about you as soon as the door closes.  No, I appreciate it.  You might want to stay.  Is this what they call a paradox?  It is.  Yes.  It is exactly a paradox. 
[01:18:00]  All right.  If he doesn't leave, he will not have made it to talk about it today.  I'm going to accept it.  I worked with that girl the other day, by the way.  Star Jones?  No.  The other one.  The other one?  Vera?  Her.  On the left.  Joy?  Joy Behar?  Her head is as big as my head and my torso.  She's got a massive head.  I saw her at the Dennis Leary roast.  Yeah.  She's very dirty in person, too, I noticed.  Like physically?  It just says dirty words and stuff.  Oh, I thought you mentioned it.  I'm going to begin my awkward walkout.  All right.  There goes Bill Burr.  See you, Bill.  There goes Bill. 
[01:18:30]  All right, guys.  Good luck to you.  Thank you.  Bye, Angel.  All right.  There goes Bill Burr as we play Jay Moore in studio part two.  All right, Bill.  I don't know about you, but I'm dying to suck Bill's cock.  Anybody else?  Let's see that one coming.  All right.  Hit it.  Here's Jay Moore.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Stay fucking tuned.  Because I'll come and fucking kill your baby bed.  Who knows? 
[01:19:00]  It's Ozzy.  He can't understand a word he says.  Joe, go.  Yes.  Go.  Who is it?  Who do you think?  I don't know.  Joe from Cleveland.  You're on the air.  Hi, Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  Sometimes you just got to start over.  I was wondering, did you guys pick up Neil Cavuto by not showing up on his show?  Because every chance he gets, he's plugging Howard. 
[01:19:30]  Neil Cavuto has been trying to get us to do his show for, I don't even know, since we got fired, I guess.  Oh, really?  I did a show for the NFL alumni at the Super Bowl in Jacksonville.  Yeah.  And Kramer was there.  Really?  Which guy looks like Louis C.K.?  Ludlow or Kramer?  Who's Kramer?  On Fox.  I thought you meant Kramer from Seinfeld.  No, no, no.  Like Ludlow and Kramer.  You know those two guys?  Yeah.  One of the guys looks, like, alarmingly like Louis C.K.  You know what I'm talking about?  No.  Fuck.  I know Louis.  I actually do. 
[01:20:00]  You do what I'm talking about?  Yeah.  So I go to him.  I go, hey, nice to meet you.  I go, look, Ludlow's holding you back, man.  He goes, we were just talking about that.  No way.  I swear to God.  And then I just, once I was it, you know, I was like a fucking burrowing worm.  I was like, yeah, you know what?  All he says is exposition.  He never takes a stance.  You're always out there on the wire, and every time he talks to him, he just throws out some  exposition bullshit.  Yeah.  And he was standing next to Gene Hackman, and Gene Hackman's looking at me like, I know  exactly what you're doing.  Gene Hackman was cool, too.  Yeah, to meet Hackman.  Do you know how fucking great that is? 
[01:20:30]  Do you know how great meeting Hackman is?  I meet a great person every night, man.  I know.  Hey, we gotta get Laszlo in here.  He's falling asleep out there.  Yeah, get Laszlo in here.  Yeah, Laszlo, wake up.  For what?  Laszlo.  For what?  Laszlo is...  Do you eat those carrots?  Laszlo's joining the party.  I got no joy!  You called those carrots?  God, suck his cock, you fucking queer!  Do what you gotta do.  What are you, a cop?  I love that that whole fucking table overthrown argument starts with, 
[01:21:00]  Did you eat those carrots?  I got no joy!  And he's such a nudge, he's just pestering about overcooking the meat.  She's like, it's not ready yet.  He's like, I just told you don't overcook.  No, more, no, more, more, more, more, more!  You break anything in there, I'm gonna kill you!  Larry, who's an animal?  Your mother's an animal, you son of a bitch!  This guy just called me an animal. 
[01:21:30]  Stop the whole neighborhood, Gene.  What a great movie.  God damn.  Ah, suck his cock, you fucking queer!  Awful wife.  Cigarette butt.  Yeah, the best.  I love that moment when she goes,  Yeah, you suck this cock?  Your fucking brother's cock is bigger than yours!  And he goes,  You suck my brother's cock?  It's like a minute, like, that's like the pinnacle of acid.  Just,  You suck my brother's cock? 
[01:22:00]  Like, really?  Like that.  I love when he goes,  I love when he goes,  Just tell me.  Like, he's trying to get her to confess that she fucked people,  and he's like,  Just tell me.  Like, it'll be alright.  Is this an awful attempt at psychology?  I'm like, yeah, just tell me.  But she's gonna go on.  Alright, he'll accept it.  Where'd you go tonight?  Went to my sister's, saw a movie.  What'd you see?  Father bride.  Again?  She's stroking her hair, you know,  she's gonna fucking grab her by the head.  Is that your car?  Yeah.  I got that car.  For those of you that don't understand, 
[01:22:30]  Don't explain it.  No, you just rent it.  So they make it play along at home.  I love when she goes,  Fat pig, selfish fool.  What?  You fat pig.  Get your hands off me,  you fat pig.  She doesn't do any selfish fool.  Oh, yes, she does.  Really?  When he's slapping her,  she goes,  What do you care anyway?  You're just a fat pig, selfish fool.  Fat pig, selfish fool.  The guy don't even want to fuck me.  Shut up.  He definitely fucked her.  Who?  Pesci.  Pesci, yeah?  Think?  No.  I don't think, 
[01:23:00]  and I think he's irrational,  because Vicky really didn't do anything wrong,  and fucking,  he's going,  Look, what do you let her wreck your life for?  She's not doing anything.  This fucking maniac  is just beating the shit out of her.  Her little Polish body,  he's just pounding,  and she did nothing wrong with her.  I think he fucked her,  and here's why.  Why?  Here's a little symposium.  All right.  I always tell you the first time,  I'm your brother.  You ask me once,  that's all I always tell you the first time.  He never tells me.  He never answers the question.  What question?  Did you fuck my wife?  What question?  He was so disgusted by it.  That went over the line.  And how mad he got  when she was out with the guys 
[01:23:30]  was because she was cheating on him, too.  Disagree.  I disagree.  Even though it was based on his friend Pete,  not Pesci.  It was never his brother  that he had those problems with.  It was his friend Pete.  I love Mickey Eyes.  Hey, you made a lot of money off your brother.  Probably more than him.  He's a hell of a fighter.  The Moulin Yons,  they're all afraid to fight you.  He's got a head of rock.  What's a little of the fast answers, Joey?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, you know, he likes you.  You know, he talks to you.  I swear, Jesus Christ, come off the cross. 
[01:24:00]  He wouldn't give a fuck, you know?  He doesn't respect anyone.  And no grudges.  That's the important one.  You've never seen Raging Bull?  Lies, Lies?  No.  No, you've got to see that.  I'm seeing it right now.  It's okay with me.  It's okay with me.  It's okay with me, but it's okay with you.  You've never seen Hugs is Broken?  You've never seen Raging Bull?  No.  Oh, sorry.  You're trying to kill me.  This is good.  This is the live production we're putting on  of Raging Bull here in the studio.  All right, let's start from the top.  Ready?  In the ring is the thing.  That's it.  A horse, a horse.  My kingdom for a horse.  Haven't had a winner in two months.  Six months.  Six months? 
[01:24:30]  Mm-hmm.  You just said you didn't know it, you dizzy fuck.  No, I didn't know the opening line.  I know that, but I didn't know the opening line.  You dizzy fuck.  And Anthony in Goodfellas has two lines.  Both lines are off camera, and both times  Pesci almost kills him.  Really?  He goes, hey, Joey, you got it all wrong.  He's a big boy, Anthony.  Let him speak for himself.  And then when he shoots Spider in the foot,  he goes, he shot him in the foot.  What do you want?  I'm a good shot.  How could you miss from this distance?  You got a problem with it, didn't Anthony?  No.  Two lines in the whole movie off camera. 
[01:25:00]  Both times he almost gets fucking whacked.  Well, two niggas just on my truck.  I know the entire script from Empire Strikes Back.  Does that help?  Oh, you do?  Well, we used to, yeah,  trigonometry class or something.  That makes perfect sense.  Right.  That makes perfect sense for you.  You're going to fight over who's going to be Princess Leah.  Somebody explain Laszlo to me.  Wait, give us some...  Laszlo's our resident tech head.  Yeah, give us some dialogue from Empire Strikes Back, though, now.  Now I'm curious.  Oh, it's all gone now, dude.  Oh, okay.  The drugs have run out.  I know one.  I knew it in high school.  Come to the dark side. 
[01:25:30]  Now!  I won't!  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Dude, that movie is going to suck.  You think the last one here is going to suck?  Last two sucked.  Yeah, I know, but I think...  This looks a lot darker.  I hope, and I think he took enough criticism from the first two to make the third one.  He doesn't give a fuck about criticism.  No, he doesn't.  I know.  He'd shave his fucking beard if he had any self-respect.  I'm trying to think maybe he...  More Jar Jar Binks is what they need.  He figured it out a long time ago.  It ain't about the movie. 
[01:26:00]  It's about the action figures and those fucking Burger King meals and all that shit.  The preview looks good, though.  It looks darker.  Well, the preview looked good for episode one, too.  Yeah, that's a good point.  And then you got in the theater, and I was looking at my buddy like, why are we here?  I had to sit through fever pitch last night.  Jar Jar Binks.  Why?  That didn't look funny at all.  I went and saw a fever pitch.  They wanted me to audition to play his friend.  I'm like, you don't think I can act like I'm his friend?  Oh.  I'm going to come in with pages in my hand and go, what do you want to do?  I say we go see the socks. 
[01:26:30]  I don't know.  We don't have money.  We'll get money.  The weirdest part about that movie, it starts with Jimmy Fallon talking like he's from Boston  in a heavy, heavy Boston accent.  Within five minutes, he's like, ah, fuck it.  Yeah, fuck it.  And just talks like Jimmy Fallon.  You know who else blew an accent?  I hate when they blow an accent.  Michelle Pfeiffer in a dangerous whatever.  Leisa?  Yeah, whatever that.  You're right.  And Malkovich in fucking the Nottsfratu movie.  Fucking lost his German accent.  Oh, he did?  Spitting his mouth, yeah.  How about Rob Morrow in Quiz Show doing like the Boston accent in Baltimore, 
[01:27:00]  more than Florida?  That I don't remember.  I remember the film, but I remember that.  How about the, oh, I was going to fucking quote something that you quote all the time.  Whoa!  Laszlo, say something.  It's a good career move.  Go on radio and be quiet.  Laszlo does the show, dude.  All right, Laszlo.  Plug your show, man.  Oh, it's called The Technophile.  It's a daily technology update.  So I sort of travel around the world and...  And he was in Germany.  Figure out what's going on.  Yeah, dude, Germany was a trip, man. 
[01:27:30]  I went to this, like the biggest technology convention in the entire world.  Germany.  I don't get it.  We will make them lampshades.  It's really nuts.  What, are they making tanks and stuff over there?  Dude, what's the new machine over there?  How to get gold teeth out quicker?  Dude, they are really cranky about still having troops.  Shower time.  Really?  There are still a lot of British troops.  And, like, you throw a couple pints into the Germans and they're, like, upset.  You know, it's like the whole...  Get over it.  It's like...  I know.  It's that whole, like, we didn't have slaves kind of thing. 
[01:28:00]  You'd still have a wall down Main Street if it wasn't for the Allies.  That's like when South Africa got the World Cup, I think.  Yeah.  And they're all...  And they're on the short list, like, three countries.  And I'm like, you know what?  And they're like, look how far they've come as a country.  I go, yeah, but you know what?  A decade.  I need a little more time than that to get fucking slavery out of my mouth.  Like, yeah, nice job.  That was mighty whitey to put down the slave...  The anti...  They had, like, all their police stuff was just designed for breaking up groups of black people. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Just, like, giant tanks with hoses, like, sticking out.  Uh-huh.  It's like, wow, that was really nice of you guys to stop apartheid.  Let's reward them for not having slavery for ten years.  What a bunch of cocks.  Diplomatic immunity.  Yes!  Yes!  Has just been revoked.  Diplomatic immunity.  Has just been revoked.  I love that Danish one, though.  Oh, and I like to lick her face.  Her face?  Yeah, just right there, right where her cheekbones are. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, you're a weird guy.  I like to lick her ass.  I've got to get Laszlo up to speed here.  When Jay Moore's in, it's an ADD show.  Yeah, I'm with you, man.  Just pop it when you can.  How many kids with ADD does it take to change a light bulb?  You want to watch TV?  I read that in Maxim.  That's good.  Top 100 girls in the world.  Okay?  Yeah.  My girlfriend not in it in FHM.  That pissed you off.  But fucking Maggie Gyllenhaal is in it and Christina Aguilera.  Like, it's a bunch of skanks.  That's how you know you're doing well in life, by the way. 
[01:29:30]  That's how you know life is good.  When you're like, how the fuck is my girl not in the top 100?  Not in there.  She's been in the top 20.  I know that, but I mean, just to even have that thought.  I'm not going to take 15 and make a big thing out of it, you know?  And when you say read Maxim, you don't read Maxim.  It's like a PowerPoint show with, like, bullet points and boobies is basically what it is.  Yeah, you don't read articles.  There's no real articles on there.  You're right.  It's like pictures, a little comments on pictures.  It's just quick.  He's going out with Nicky Cox.  Excellent.  Just so you're up to speed here, there, Laszlo.  Laszlo did the Oreo.  I'll throw her under a bus for Serena Williams, though. 
[01:30:00]  Wow, really?  You really are into the Serena Williams business, aren't you?  Because I heard it last time.  You might fuck stripper pussy.  Pussy, actress pussy, model pussy, but raise your hand if you've ever fucked championship pussy.  The number one ranked vagina in the world that's in the fucking paper.  In the paper.  I've never fucked actress pussy.  I've never fucked actress pussy.  Where's she?  She's ever pussy for free.  Fuck this.  That's excellent.  Jesus, Jay.  Remind me of me.  Get on that microphone again.  Yeah, right?  Who's coming in next?  Who's using that mic?  I think Ben was using that.  Speaking of Howard, your studio is so much nicer than Howard's. 
[01:30:30]  Because I was at K-Rock, and I...  Are you name-dropping?  No.  I just want to tell you that I went in...  That is the...  Because you see it on TV, and it looks like the...  It looks fine.  Yeah.  I went in there, dumpiest studio I've ever seen.  Really?  And that weird, like, Negro fishbowl thing on the side.  It's just the weirdest...  Negro fishbowl thing.  It's just weird.  It's like a monkey dunk tank.  Oh, shit. 
[01:31:00]  And the separate water fountains they have over there.  Easy.  Oh, that is fucking funny.  Now, you're in Germany.  You're at this big tech show in Germany.  Right.  And you have the angry Germans.  Yes, and I actually hung out with the German military for a little bit.  You did?  Yes.  What's that like now?  How are they?  They're, you know, a little beat down.  Are they?  Do their uniforms look similar to the old World War II ones?  No, they've got the whole new...  Yeah, they've lost the whole Star Wars thing, you know?  That's a shame. 
[01:31:30]  What about the officers?  They still got snappy, like, those big, long leather coats and stuff?  Last year, when I was...  Well, best-dressed army ever.  World War II.  You know, well, they're trying to help us find Osama.  Are they?  Yes.  And they had...  Last year, they had these really cool remote-controlled gas-powered planes.  Yeah.  You know, that they were...  The drones or whatever.  That they're, you know, kind of flying.  I guess too many soldiers crashed them.  So now they've switched to electric models that are flown by a laptop.  Really?  All you do is put the wings on the side, hold it up in the air, launch it, and the laptop flies it. 
[01:32:00]  The laptop flies the thing.  What do you pre-program in where it's got to go?  Yep.  And it goes there, takes its pictures, its video, and then flies back and lands without anybody flying the thing.  Right.  And it won't do any kamikaze maneuvers, supposedly.  No?  No.  And one of the German...  Was this German soldiers?  Yep.  And one of them has to, like, program in and just lets it go.  Yes.  We program, it goes, and they circle.  You don't fart, Neely. 
[01:32:30]  What is he doing?  I saw Jay come behind me, and I get very nervous.  When people are...  It's like a monster rainbox of some sort.  It's an action figure.  Am I going to waste one nodding to the mic?  Dude, will you do me a favor and get Ben a PDA or something?  He calls me.  You guys were in Boston last week.  He calls it.  Dude, oh, man, it's crazy up here.  Boston's crazy.  Are you on the show next week?  I'm like, I don't know.  You're the producer.  Who called are you on the show?  That's a good way for Ben to do that, though.  You should call up, like, every celebrity. 
[01:33:00]  Call up like George Clooney.  George, are you on the show?  Maybe I am.  Maybe I didn't know him.  Ben rules with an iron flask.  And every time I talk to him, I'm like, do you have your calendar?  I don't have my calendar in front of me.  I'm like, that might be a helpful thing as a producer.  Get him a trio.  And it took him, like, three months to figure out how to turn the thing on.  I think he's finally using it.  I don't know.  Look, Ben, look, I'm having problems with the transportation.  The flight's like, hey, Mark Bruno.  Tom Brady.  Let me tell you. 
[01:33:30]  You'll figure it out.  The guy was funny as hell.  He could do anything.  Dude, while it was in jail.  Oh, we did an hour on that yesterday, Jay.  Yes.  What is it?  The midget story from yesterday, Jay.  See, he's looking at the headline in the book.  Best headline ever.  Is that one of the best headlines ever?  He's wearing blue slippers.  I know.  Wait, I didn't notice that.  That's the midget story.  Did you hear what this guy did?  That's a lady, by the way.  Did you hear what this guy did?  You said he.  Yeah, they're both chicks.  Oh, my God.  This guy painted a yellow line from their house into the street that went, what, five houses down? 
[01:34:00]  Five houses, and then started singing, uh, hi-ho, hi-ho.  Yeah, follow the yellow brick road.  Tell him to follow the yellow brick road, just yelling the little midgets.  But he didn't just paint it out their house to the street.  He painted it out their house to the street, and then five houses down.  He had to keep going.  Shaking that spray thing again.  You would have.  Yeah, I mean, that's motivation.  We all would have.  That's motivation.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:34:30]  All right, we've got to get Rich Voss back in the air here.  Rich?  Try and let's go.  Can you guys hang up on me or give me the silence?  Sweetie, first of all, you were talking about bombing in an airport, which was not very smart.  Oh, I was outside, though.  Oh, that makes a big difference.  All rules don't apply, though.  You're right.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, did your birth certificate come to your daughter?  She's delivering it now.  So you're trying to get on the 11 o'clock flight to Atlantis, right?  Yeah, why?  No, we're just getting an update, you idiot.  This is what we do on the show.  We start storylines, and we want to end them. 
[01:35:00]  Did he say Atlanta or Atlantis?  Uh, yeah.  I think you said the 11 o'clock flight to Atlantis.  Were you at the Atlantis you said on vacation?  Yeah.  Is it nice?  It's beautiful.  It's unbelievable, yeah.  Yeah?  You don't drink anymore.  You've got to find Ed the Coconut Man.  Why?  He makes him kill it.  Well, it doesn't matter to you, so forget it.  Well, if I did drink, do you think I would drink one of those little coconut drinks with  an umbrella in it?  If I drink, I drink shots.  I'm a man. 
[01:35:30]  I'll say.  But we're waiting.  She picked up the birth certificate in Plainfield.  I made a call.  What time is the ETA?  I made a call.  You like that?  I didn't think anybody would grab that.  What time is the arrival expecting?  Big words for you today.  The arrival's at 4 o'clock at the...  I want to take your hand and just start biting it.  Oh, Kelly's on the phone.  Ask her.  Ask her what she's at.  This guy is flying all day.  Kelly?  Hello?  All day.  Hello?  It's non-stop. 
[01:36:00]  Who's this?  Kelly?  Is she at the airport now?  I thought he was talking to us.  No, he's not.  I'm talking to you guys.  I'm having my kid talk to my ex-wife.  Well, where is she?  She's pulling into the airport.  You know the ex-wife did this to you on purpose.  You know that, right?  Everyone knows you need a birth certificate to leave the country.  What time is she...  Your ex-wife is still getting back at you.  What time is your show tonight?  Departing.  Departing.  She is the dumbest.  And then I told her...  She goes, well, I've got to go to Plainfield and get a birth certificate, right?  At 7.30.  I said, be there at 9 o'clock. 
[01:36:30]  The first one when they open the doors at City Hall, right?  Right, yeah.  9 o'clock.  She calls me, 9 o'clock, 20 minutes away from where...  Well, I had to drop my other son off at daycare.  Well, what's your priority?  To get your two daughters to Nassau on a free vacation?  Or get your little kid to the daycare?  You know what I mean?  What's more important, a vacation or school?  It's daycare.  It's not school.  Stupid.  Okay?  You ought to know you...  Well, whatever.  I think you're proving that school is more important. 
[01:37:00]  You certainly are.  It sounds to me like what's more important, my kids or yours?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, it's only here.  But, Rich, it didn't matter because you wouldn't have made that early flight anyway, so it didn't...  We would have made it if we would have had the birth certificate right from the beginning.  Oh, birth certificate.  Nah, she never would have gotten there by 9.  Save birth certificate again.  What's that?  What?  Save birth?  But anyhow, she's going to be...  Wait, wait.  Wait, Rich.  What?  What did you say? 
[01:37:30]  Huh?  What did she have to get from City Hall?  A birth certificate.  You idiot.  What are you even talking about?  Birth certificate.  Well, if she would have gotten it at 9, she still wouldn't have probably gotten there for a 10 o'clock flight to get you on...  No, no, but I don't want to miss the 11 o'clock flight and have to take the 1 o'clock flight.  Look, dude, you're preaching to the choir.  I'll suck your cock for an hour.  I'm saying she's probably on her way.  Did Jay Moore leave the studio?  He's right here.  Yeah, he left.  He left?  Yep.  Was she trashing me?  That's why you guys called?  Well, yeah.  Well, no, he did okay radio for us today. 
[01:38:00]  He's gone, and we figured, you know, we'd get back to you and smooth things over with you.  He can't really trash anybody.  What?  Why?  Because he's got too much dirt on him.  Like what?  What?  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  Here, talk to Ellen.  Yo, what up?  Hi, Ellen.  How are you?  Good, brother.  Which one of you girls didn't have your birth certificate?  What?  Who didn't have the birth certificate?  We lost it.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you annoyed at Dad? 
[01:38:30]  Uh, no.  How old is this girl?  Does your daddy smoke too much?  Yeah.  Yeah, huh?  Are you going to smoke?  You know he's using again, right?  What?  Does your dad ever, like, rub behind his ear and make you smell?  Ew, yes.  Or he tells me to pull his finger.  Is that what he calls it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does he tuck you in at night?  No.  Any inappropriate kisses?  Is he, uh... 
[01:39:00]  Here, here he is.  Yeah.  Hello?  How old is that girl?  Hi, sweetie.  Twelve.  Excellent.  Right on the cusp of experience.  Boy, they're great at that age, ain't they?  Hold it in.  Let's go over to the head of him.  So what happened?  Did your birth certificate come?  I told her to come to departing.  She drives downstairs to arriving.  Well, she's arriving at the airport.  That's true.  What an idiot.  No.  Departing is where you drop people off.  No, it's...  That's true.  Yeah, it is.  Okay, I'm sorry. 
[01:39:30]  That would have been really funny.  That was a joke.  I was with Anthony on that.  Well, what do you...  Damn it.  How...  How long were you guys married, Rich?  Well, I'm arriving.  Five years.  Five years of marriage to Voss.  How bright do you expect her to be?  Five years?  Yeah.  That's it?  Five years.  That's the most she could take.  She ain't coming from Menza.  Oh.  Is she here?  Well, listen.  Wait, hold on.  Where is she?  Do you see her?  Go get it, because I don't want to look at her.  Yeah.  No, my kids are mad, because I'm talking about their mom like that. 
[01:40:00]  Hey, dude, why can't...  Why can't Jay Moore trash anybody?  You...  Why?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How much dirt do you think they have on Jay Moore?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What dirt?  What dirt could we possibly have?  He's getting a divorce, and he's banging a really hot chick.  That's right.  How bad could it be?  How many...  Oh.  I don't want to talk about him.  The guy...  The guy did help me out, so...  I'm not going to talk bad about him.  Why?  You have bad things?  You have dirt on him?  Come with it. 
[01:40:30]  You should tell us, so when he's in next time, we can hit him with it.  Well, when I'm in studio next, I will.  But, Rich, I...  But, but...  I can't...  You know what?  I'm not going to trash...  You have nothing on him.  It's just...  It's not...  Yeah.  It's not...  What do you have on...  What do you have on him?  You've got nothing.  Come on, dude.  You know how this show works.  He had a lot to say about you.  What's that?  He had a lot to say about you.  Yep.  No, he didn't.  I swear, dude.  I just met the guy, and he started talking about you.  Well, what do you say?  That's Laszlo.  I don't need to get caught in the middle of this, dude.  I'm here to talk about technology.  That's Laszlo, by the way. 
[01:41:00]  Do you think...  Do you think, uh...  They really canceled the last episode because they wanted to play Father of the Pride?  Do you really think that's the reason?  What do you think the reason is?  I don't know.  I wasn't privy to the network discussion.  Yeah, you're a little more on the inside there, Rick.  Yeah, why did they cancel the last episode of Last Comic Standing 3?  I would go because they didn't like the host.  So they went to the last episode?  Are you insane?  Yeah, look, the cops are chasing our way.  Why didn't they like Jay? 
[01:41:30]  What am I coming into, dude?  I'll come in next week.  Dude, you can't just leave us hanging.  You're going away for a while, and you're a big star.  Who knows when you're going to be on the show again?  Why didn't they like Jay more?  Why didn't they like Jay more?  I don't know.  He might be sitting there right now, and you guys are setting me up.  That's why I can't take that chance.  Dude, he's gone.  Yeah, you're brilliant, Voss.  You idiot.  Why?  That's all been a clever ruse.  The first phone call this, it's all been a setup.  Of course.  First of all, when you want information, you don't call a person an idiot. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, look, I taught you about insider trading information and how to get it.  Voss, but you can't leave us hanging.  You know how this show works.  I know.  Why didn't they like Jay more as the host?  Well, a bunch of, there's a lot of reasons.  This is not the Veloci papers.  Can you just fucking give us the skinny?  Why?  Jesus Christ.  Don't run over the phone to talk like that.  It's better in person.  No, you teased it. 
[01:42:30]  Just give us something now.  Pretend it's just me and you laying on pillows just talking like we do.  Nose to nose, eyes kind of half shut.  Are you on a cell phone?  I don't know you.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  Come on, Voss.  What?  I can't talk about it.  Come on, Voss.  You could turn around your whole appearance.  I could turn around my whole appearance?  Yeah, people will forget that you bombed all morning and then they will talk about, oh my God, that little tidbit about Jay Moore.  People are used to me.  All right, let me call you right back.  We're going online to get our tickets. 
[01:43:00]  I'll call you right back.  Oh, come on.  I'm serious.  I gotta get my tickets.  I'll call you right back.  So what?  Talk right in front of the fucking bitch behind the counter.  No, no.  We gotta give him...  Tell her you're a big shot.  See, I'm on the air, bitch.  Now hurry up with that ticket.  All right, I'll call you right back.  I love you.  All right, he's blowing us off.  Of course he is.  He says...  I thought we had him.  Now I'm really curious.  Yeah, really?  Why'd you get fired?  I just started talking like him for no reason.  Now I'm really curious.  I don't think he has any dirt.  I'll call him back.  I think Vos just said that.  Like, yeah, there's some dirt on Jay.  What is it?  I think he's been listening to Ant. 
[01:43:30]  What did Ant say?  Why would he trash you?  You're the only one to give that hack a shot.  Cocksucker.  I don't know.  I don't mean to say that's a hack.  I mean, you know, just in case he's hosting something.  Yuck.  All right, Laszlo.  San Francisco.  Gonna put more fatties in a scale.  Oh, that was the best show ever.  I was watching that.  The silhouettes of them passing the medicine ball in the opening credits.  Celebrity of...  Fiz Marquis.  I love Fiz Marquis.  He loses a lot more weight.  Ralphie May in the pool was just the worst sight ever.  It looked like a lava lamp. 
[01:44:00]  And Ralphie's excuse for when they go,  okay, now you guys can pick anyone from your team to not be on the scale.  Like, gee, is it going to be the Snapple lady or the guy that weighs 490?  And Ralphie goes, uh, it'll be me.  I'm all swollen from traveling.  Swollen from traveling.  My ring don't even fit.  That's it.  Wow, where'd you fly in from, Neptune?  The best part of that show was Wendy Snapple going under hypnosis and saying she ate her  whole life because her parents decided to have another kid.  She was two years old.  So, what, did you go down to the corner for chicken parmesan? 
[01:44:30]  Right.  Where's my stroller?  I need a fucking pie.  What a fat.  What do you think she ate?  K-K-K-Club?  I think she ate the K-K-K-Club.  K-K-K-Club?  Come, beautiful girls.  Come, beautiful girls.  Someone listen to the replay and count how many subjects we covered today on this ADD show.  2,000.  All right.  Laszlo.  Well, Laszlo.  I don't know how to segue into anything after that.  I don't know.  What, are you talking about technology?  You don't segue into the show. 
[01:45:00]  You just go.  Laszlo.  Technology's got to go seven games.  What's that from?  The revenue money alone between Germany.  No, Lieutenant.  Dude, do you know who invented the MP3?  Oh, I do, actually.  Do you?  Yes.  Who?  Mark Perrano III.  Ah.  Mark Perrano.  It's a German.  A German guy invented the MP3.  I think there's another little motive for Laszlo today.  A lot of German speak.  Yeah.  What?  I know the Germans.  You know the Germans are great? 
[01:45:30]  Are you saying Hitler was good?  No.  No.  No.  Get him.  I've pothed you.  I've pothed you.  I've pothed you.  I know it fires at him.  I actually know the name of the guy.  Do you?  Yes.  Who is it?  Joe, who cares?  I got a technology question for you.  All right, go.  All right, guys.  I fucking bought an iPod.  This is why I hope fucking Steve Jobs fucking cracks his tooth on a urinal.  I hate Mac.  I fucking hate Mac.  What happened, Jimmy?  Did you get the faggy Bono iPod? 
[01:46:00]  No, I certainly didn't.  Ben's got it.  There's nothing faggy about Bono.  Of course he does.  Ben's got it.  Take it back.  Of course he does.  What happened to your iPod, Jimmy?  Well, I got a good 40 gig one for a lot of songs.  Uh-huh.  And I have Napster, so I fucking, I put all my stuff in iTunes, which blows.  It fucking blows.  Yeah.  And it won't take most of my WAV files because they're like Windows Media and they're protected,  so it won't convert them to put them on my iPod.  So how do I get the ones from Napster that are my fucking, I paid for on Napster.  How do I get them onto my faggot iPod?  Are they, you gotta buy them again? 
[01:46:30]  No.  I will not buy them.  No.  That's the deal.  Jesus.  I will not purchase them again.  You gotta buy them again?  You don't have to buy them.  They're WAV files?  They're Windows Media.  Whatever they are.  WMA.  Right.  As all the R's cry, poverty, you gotta buy them again.  No, you don't.  There's free things that you can download that'll convert it.  Don't tell them that.  But it won't convert them because they keep saying it's protected.  It won't convert a protected file.  Nah, listen.  There's enough hackers out there.  There's a lot of free software.  Steve's here to help you.  Steve doesn't know.  I already fucking asked him.  That program you sent me, Steve.  Thanks.  What program? 
[01:47:00]  I don't know.  Why don't you just have Steve do it?  Who's going to allow Steve to use their mic today, by the way?  Yeah, use this one.  Steve.  Dude, he's got...  No, I don't mean it because of that.  He's really sick.  Jake grabbed the mic back really fast.  Jake farted on that mic.  No, you don't want the megaphone used either.  Just yell from the background.  Just talk into a handheld.  Yeah, go ahead.  Stop leaning on me, patient zero.  I spent 20 minutes on the phone with Jimmy, telling him how to exactly do this. 
[01:47:30]  And I may actually have to come into Jimmy's house and do it for him.  How about I just bring my laptop to you?  I don't want you fucking sneaking around in my house in your underwear.  Your creepy bear body.  How did I get in my underwear?  I don't know.  I can just picture you in your underwear and a pair of slippers.  I'd be happy to do it for you.  Lounging over.  Asking me to rub vitamin E oil on his stomach stapling scar.  I'm trying to cut down the scarring for the beach.  Just rub a little bit of lotion on him.  Lame colored boxers.  Tea tree oil.  Creep.  Seriously, George Michael, why? 
[01:48:00]  George Michael?  It's a very popular beard now.  No, it is a popular beard.  Of course it's a popular beard.  Right, if you're giving a head in a bathroom in California.  Exactly.  Wow.  That beard looks perfect on the other end of a hole in between fucking toilet stalls.  Feels just like a pussy, doesn't it?  I've noticed over the years Steve looks more and more like Robert Kelly.  Yeah, I like that.  The chubby George Michael look.  Poor guy came in here to help with technology. 
[01:48:30]  We accused him of going to Glory Hole theme park.  Can you, after the show, maybe on the QT...  Hey, why is Ben arguing with someone on a cell phone in the background?  Who are you talking to?  No, it's boss.  He can't talk about any of that stuff he said.  All right.  Oh, we've got a non-canal heat plug.  You're not going to get sued?  What are they going to sue him for?  His fucking non-existent fingernails?  How big is the tumor behind his ear?  It is awful.  The smell that comes from that thing.  It really is brutal.  It is brutal.  We took turns in a parking lot one day.  Three out of. 
[01:49:00]  I swear to God, three out of five of us were dry heaving.  And two guys puked.  My belly button stinks a little bit today.  I've got to be honest.  I fucking marked one into it.  Stop it.  Between that and the smell coming...  Because Jay opened his skull bottle.  Like that little thing.  So that smell in my...  Ooh, lovely.  So is there something I could put on my computer which will convert them and put them in my fucking iPod?  Because I'm ready to throw a 40 gig iPod out the window.  Did you go to even Yahoo or Google and just put convert Windows files for iPod?  Just something like that. 
[01:49:30]  And then you'll get 20 things that come up where you click and download a small program and it converts your files.  But I want a free one and he gave me one.  They are free.  He gave me a link and the fucking thing so we can't do it, it's protected.  That fucking faggot program wouldn't have done in the balls just to override this protection thing.  I would love to be on the wall while he's online trying to figure out his computer.  You know, son of a bitch, back to porn in two seconds.  He just stands up and pisses on the keyboard.  Fuck you.  It annoys me.  Because I bought this iPod and I'm like, you know what?  I'm sick and tired of having a big laptop on the plane trying to listen to tunes. 
[01:50:00]  I figured the iPod would be fantastic and I just can't even make that work.  Half my songs are on it and half are languishing on my fucking computer and it's frustrating me.  Languishing.  Languishing.  Now, is it stolen music that you're talking to?  No!  No, I paid it all from last year.  He told us off air it's all stolen.  I wouldn't tell you it's stolen.  Believe me.  No, it's not.  You can convert Windows Media Files, even protected ones, to go on your iPhone.  Yes.  But how, man?  That's the fucking question.  Dude, I am happy to give you the program. 
[01:50:30]  Okay.  I have it.  People are like, why is everyone laughing?  Get his email address.  The reason is because Jim is sticking his really big gut out as he's trying to answer Anthony.  He put his hands on his hips Superman style and just stood there.  That's the regular guy look.  Yeah, the regular guy look.  How many times do I have to pay for this fucking song?  That's prodigious.  Are you a hands on hip at the urinal guy as you pee?  No.  You ever see those guys?  Absolutely not.  It's not even a hand down there or nothing? 
[01:51:00]  No.  I'm always amazed by the guys whose piss comes out like the moment they arrive.  Like the guy just shows up.  How did you make it, horse?  You know, you're at a concert, the guy just rolls up, zip-blah.  It takes me a while to get it all rocking together.  It's got to get that right.  It's got to work its way through.  But that's because I have a narrow urethra.  Bobby?  Some of these guys, they roll right up here.  They just drop it like it's hard.  They're the state ones that leave all that pubic hair all over the damn urinal. 
[01:51:30]  That drives me nuts.  This just in, no smoke.  Thank you.  No smoke?  Oh, we're getting no smoke now.  Yeah, CNN is just showing a picture of the chimney.  The chimney.  The CNN's the Vatican.  Well, when they vote and don't have a pope, you see the black smoke comes out.  Are we all supposed to stare away?  It's all the same shit, aren't we?  They need to hurry up and elect a pope so we can get around to going to Africa and telling  AIDS-ridden communities not to use condoms.  There you go.  They wouldn't anyway.  African men refuse to use condoms.  There's work to be done.  That's not about Catholicism. 
[01:52:00]  And they don't eat the coochies.  Fucking tribal idiots.  They catch things that make you shit out your own intestines.  They don't care.  They kiss the bodies.  They know they have the Ebola with fucking margis in it.  And they go, with the fucking bone through their nose.  They're awful.  They started AIDS on purpose.  Say the whole thing.  It's like when you go to Kennedy Airport.  Have you been to the International Arrivals area at Kennedy Airport?  No.  My health won't allow it.  All the Asians.  Jesus Christ.  All the Asians come off with those, like, gas masks. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, they're wearing, like, breathers.  It's weird.  It's like a hospital wing opened up or something.  Well, they know better.  Well, it's because they're piled on top of each other.  The SARS over there.  And the pope is conservative, granted.  But what do people expect?  He's the fucking pope.  He's not going to be liberal abroad.  Like, oh, yeah, go ahead.  Fuck your life partner in the ass.  No problem.  Why would he be liberal abroad?  Yeah, I don't know.  Didn't they just admit that the earth is round, like, 15, 20 years ago?  Yeah.  Well, there's some of those tribes still out there. 
[01:53:00]  You know, they don't know about anything.  They don't know about aircraft or iPods.  Nazis.  Savages.  Germans.  Germans.  Beautiful girls.  Beautiful girls.  Suck some cocks.  Smoke some grass.  That's not your money.  That's my money.  I'm a cop.  Leave it on the Mets.  Did I steer you wrong?  Good.  You owe me money.  Fuck it. 
[01:53:30]  I'm in.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm in.  I went to the stadium today, and I saw Darryl Strawberry.  And I looked him in his eyes.  And he fucking told me he's saving it up for the big one.  Gentlemen, it never could go any other way.  Leave it on the Mets.  Beautiful girls.  That's my out pitch. 
[01:54:00]  That's my change.  That's my change up.  Chris Penn, of course.  More tech talk.  Woo.  Yeah.  What else did you see in Germany?  Something cool.  Strip clubs.  Oh, German strip clubs.  Any curb jumping?  No.  Curb jumping.  I actually went to a strip club in Prague.  Prague.  I'm a beautiful girl.  Strip club in Prague is beautiful.  They've all got those, like, rusky accents.  The rusky accents.  Kikkat club.  Kikkat club.  What was the name of the strip club in Prague?  Oh, shit.  Gandolfini is choking up coffee.  You all right over there? 
[01:54:30]  No, she just cracked.  Jesus.  That's nice.  What was the name of the strip club?  I don't even remember.  I was too whacked on Absinthe.  You were drinking Absinthe?  Have you ever had that shit?  What the hell was I heard about?  Oh, it's fucking great, man.  Oh, dude, it is.  You know the Absinthe?  Oh, yeah, Jim drinks it all the time.  There's a reason that it took...  Well, maybe it was back in the day.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  Back in the older days.  Have you ever had it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.  This is the first time I ever had it.  Absolutely.  What is it? 
[01:55:00]  Is it illegal?  It's illegal in the United States.  Yeah, in the United States.  It's illegal.  It's got...  It's hard to get.  It's got Thulone.  It's got this, like, a hallucinogen in it.  And Van...  They say, like, Van Gogh drank so much of it,  maybe the reason he chopped his ear off.  Yeah.  Hemingway...  Voss should drink it.  Hemingway was whacked on it.  Chopped that disgusting smelling ear off his head.  I heard another Van Gogh wrote it,  and then he went over to sign something for a Muslim,  like, I'm glad you like my play.  Fucking savages.  Haven't you ever heard of fucking peaceful disagreement? 
[01:55:30]  Awful religion.  God almighty, what awful people.  Why Muslims?  No.  All right, we get it.  Now I know what he's talking about, finally.  That Van Gogh.  There's another Van Gogh.  Camel fuckers.  And don't get me wrong,  by camel fuckers, I mean Arabs.  Point, Jay.  Good point.  You guys say what you want.  Fucking Jay Moore tells me like it is.  That's why I love him.  You know, I think I'm going to join you up here.  Yeah, what's the deal with Jimmy likes to stand? 
[01:56:00]  I always have done that.  I mean, sometimes I sit, but I just feel more...  I guess because, you know...  I like the plie you got working next to your ball bag.  Jimmy's got his foot up on the console, like half a fag.  He's got his heel in his cock.  Yeah, so what?  What's wrong with that?  Were you rubbing that?  There used to be a girl in school.  Her name was Jolie, back in sixth grade.  Pretty girl?  No, she was like...  She was fat, and she was the one everyone just goofed on, mocked, and never left her alone  for a minute.  Jolie, huh?  Jolie.  And she would sit on her foot and rock back and forth during the class. 
[01:56:30]  Rub one out?  Yeah.  Beautiful girl, rub one out?  Only rubbing one out.  Make a pussy all wet?  All wet?  Get the pussy all wet?  Rub one out.  Dream about sucking a cock?  Point and laugh.  What are you doing, rub?  What grade is this?  It was sixth grade.  Sixth grade, little bush?  Get a little fucking bush.  Little nothing.  Little fat girl with your big bush?  Yeah.  Nice.  That's the problem with the obesity epidemic these days.  Who is you?  The teen girls.  Me?  The teen girls aren't as hot as they used to be, because they've got guts. 
[01:57:00]  Well, go to some of the other schools.  Yeah.  You know, walk around the schools around the time they're getting off in a French coat.  Who's by the schools slowly at night with your tinted windows?  Maybe you didn't see 25th Hour Rosario Dawson.  I'm not saying.  Oh, natural with that fucking Catholic school outfit.  Maybe you didn't see 25th Hour the Spike Lee joint.  Now I'm doing Colin by accident.  That was only Colin.  So then I'll just keep going.  Maybe you didn't see 25th Hour Rosario Dawson in that little Catholic school outfit.  But her name was Macherell.  It's unbelievable.  My God. 
[01:57:30]  I made a mess.  She's a beautiful girl.  Rosario Dawson.  Now she's on the cover of like every magazine.  Like, look at me.  I'm Puerto Rican.  I have a brown toe.  My toe is inauthentic.  Folks, don't look at this suit.  It's distracting.  Anyway, I should have worn my denim shirt.  Like some kind of, you know, reject from like Chess King up here.  No?  Nothing?  Nothing?  It doesn't matter.  Bombing horribly.  That's good.  That's nice.  Tough crowd. 
[01:58:00]  Let's take the chairs away.  It was a brilliant move by our producers.  Oh my God, right?  That was Colin's move.  What?  That was Colin's idea.  Why did Colin think?  He just wanted to try something different.  It didn't work.  Taking the chairs away.  He wanted to try something different.  And the producers would want to fight to put it back.  Colin was a direct producer.  I mean, he had the ultimate say, but they were going nuts.  I guess they had the last laugh.  They certainly did.  Why did they can't?  That show must have cost nothing to me.  This is with Doug Herzog.  Doug Herzog.  Now you set him off.  No, Doug's not bad for Comedy Central.  I hope he fucking falls on a flight of steps and his mouth just falls on a cock. 
[01:58:30]  You stink, Doug.  Yeah.  Don't buy my shows when you work at USA?  How do you not buy my show?  I go in there to pitch Doug a show, and he goes, well, no, we don't want to do that.  Well, what the fuck am I in here pitching you shows for, cock?  You brought me in here to pitch your shows.  It's fucking USA.  Buy something and stop showing me fucking reruns of a movie.  See, I don't fake it.  You caught me looking.  I'm looking outside corner.  You got me. 
[01:59:00]  I never took the bat off my shoulder.  I don't give a fuck.  Ricky can't hit that.  I'm like Ricky Henderson.  They took it off the air because fucking they didn't like the point of view we were coming from.  What, that blacks steal and don't tip?  And they're late.  Hey, anything that, you know how it is, man.  You fuck with the ideology of the left, and they're going to fucking yank you off the air, and that was what happened.  And it's like, I'm paranoid, but I got the notes.  Don't talk about race.  Don't talk about politics.  Why did I get the bell on blacks are late and don't tip?  Because it's kind of an all-encompassing stereotype.  Stereotypes are true.  Irish people drink. 
[01:59:30]  That's why me and Jimmy are sober.  Yes.  See?  All right.  Jews, well, I'm not that dumb.  Jews help people.  They help people.  Right.  They're making inroads into Hollywood.  They are.  They're doing it right for themselves.  Couple beautiful Jews.  I am essential to the war effort.  Couple beautiful Jews.  One-armed shoveling motherfucker.  Your boyfriend circumcised?  Couple beautiful girls?  Couple beautiful Jews.  I could give back the bell. 
[02:00:00]  The black club?  Ring the bell?  Black people don't tip.  When I was a waiter and a black couple would come in, we would fight over who would have  to take the black people.  Really?  Run you ragged.  Let me get a strawberry, virgin colada, lemon.  Lemon?  Bitch, I ain't through.  Lemon.  I need lemon.  Two lemon.  But the peel, not the whole lemon.  And ice.  A cup of ice.  Whoa, hey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  There's only four meatballs in the meatball soup.  Well, it's a cup.  God damn.  And then, like, at the end, it's like a $200 check and the guy hands you like a $5 bill  like, hey, man, that's for you. 
[02:00:30]  Thank you for everything.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  That's for you, Danny.  Thanks for the tip, Clyde.  The best is, like, on the fifth of the month when the welfare checks drop.  Oh, now that's a bell.  Now that's a bell.  That's a bell.  I'm serious.  You are live long.  What's up, man?  This is a whole white Nazi agenda.  You sound a little taller on the radio.  You're not a bad-looking man, Laszlo.  All I'm saying is I worked at a pizza place in the ghetto.  You're a handsome man, Laszlo.  I get out of here and I'm going to come see you guys and fun shit.  That's fascism, man. 
[02:01:00]  So the welfare checks drop.  When the eagle shits.  When the eagle shits.  Nice.  That's what they call it.  Right.  When the trickle down.  I worked at this pizza place called Godfather's Pizza in Oklahoma City.  And, dude, when that welfare check hit, we were ducking.  Because they would come in and we had a buffet.  And white and black.  And just ravage the place.  He has to say that.  Buggin' out ever complain that there was no black pictures on the wall?  You want Italians on the wall? 
[02:01:30]  Open your own pizzeria.  You could put your aunts, your father, you could put your fucking uncles.  But in Sal's, it's Italian-Americans only.  20 de-cell batteries.  Rarely do I see Italian motherfuckers eating this thing.  Are you starting trouble?  Are you a troublemaker?  I got your boycott right here.  Swinging.  Pop, pop, pop.  Are you a troublemaker?  What freedom?  There's no fucking free here.  I'm the boss.  That's freedom.  There's a pizza.  Make a fucking delivery.  That's free. 
[02:02:00]  You niggas are disturbing me!  When you come to Sal's, there's no music, no rap, no music, no music.  With Spike Lee in that, what was the name?  I can't remember his name.  Mookie.  Mookie with the boob and the ice cube or whatever.  I haven't seen that in years.  I just saw it.  It's one of the best comedies ever.  No, that's a great movie.  English.  Speak English.  Spike Lee was a funny dude.  It's bad enough you named him Hector.  Get a fucking life, Mookie. 
[02:02:30]  To the curb, Trump change bomb.  Sal, if you want me to go any faster, you got to just give me more time because you must  have a guilty conscience.  I love John Duterte.  My friends, they mock me.  They say, go, go, go serve pizza to the movies.  Do they put food on your table, Pino?  Do they put clothes on your back?  They're not your friends.  These kids grew up on my food.  I'm proud of them.  All right, four slices and I'm out of here.  God, how do you remember all that? 
[02:03:00]  No kidding.  It really is.  I don't know my mother's birthday and that's it.  Encyclopedia.  Jay, it's scary.  Let's do the right thing.  I understand that, bud.  You got to get a picture of these two.  They're both standing in the same uniform style.  Two men standing up.  I want to do the gut out guy like Jimmy.  A couple beautiful girls.  Right.  You can't.  You don't need to.  With their heel and their crotch.  With my gut and your talent.  So, Laszlo, what were you talking about?  What happened?  I fucking know.  What's the absence thing?  Laszlo, you're kind of dull.  Absent.  It's hard to get a word in edgewise when you're doing like Hollywood Remade over there. 
[02:03:30]  Chris Penn?  Would Chris Penn like him?  I don't even know who this fucking Laszlo guy is.  But all I know is we've been talking technology for the better part of a fucking hour.  Thank God Tom Sizemore's alive because then otherwise people would think I was the craziest  fucking Hollywood.  This guy fucking sat down and the first thing he said was fucking technology this, technology  that.  And I don't care how mad you are at me that's not half as mad as daddy's. 
[02:04:00]  I don't want to say all the same shit I said last time I was on.  It's still funny.  It's still good.  And we've got a whole new audience.  Jay, so you should.  Jim from Taxi.  What would he say?  You know.  You know.  You watch.  Oh, I love it.  I mean, you're talking about Bravo.  Columbo.  All his crimes are so high.  High end.  I'm in the middle of my symphony.  All the high end crimes.  Yeah.  Never just some drag off the street.  So he's the composer.  I'm scoring my film, Lieutenant.  I just can't figure out how the footprints got by the window outside your bedroom. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, I was gardening earlier in the day.  Well, it's quite simple, Lieutenant.  What happened here was...  And then they proceeded to hang themselves.  I was pruning my roses, and I must not have changed...  Oh, you know what?  You're right.  That's what it is.  That's all I want to do is tie up these little sets.  They're beautiful roses.  I used to do a bit, and I felt so hacky doing it, because it was a Columbo impression.  I'll say.  But it was like...  No, but it was sort of not hacky, because it was now. 
[02:05:00]  If it was 1989, it'd be like...  Everyone's doing them, yeah.  Him bringing in Al-Qaeda, like...  Box cutters.  You know, I got a box cutter at home, but I never thought about bringing it on an airplane.  Ain't that something?  That sucks.  It's not a bad bit.  I know, but you got to do Columbo.  Yeah.  And a lot of people are like, what's Columbo?  He's doing the impression.  I don't do Columbo.  I just do the people.  The criminals.  The criminals?  Yeah.  Like, remember that one episode where the guy was like, no, my wife just came into the 
[02:05:30]  garage and leaned over, and a blonde hair fell in the boat.  You know what?  That must be it.  Why would a man go fishing on Christmas Eve?  I can't figure it out.  So we took...  He crashed the plane into the building?  Really?  You know, I crashed my car just last week.  There have been times I wanted to push the missus out of a boat myself.  Mrs. Columbo can be quite fucking annoying.  So you think the bloated woman aborted the baby? 
[02:06:00]  What?  I was trying to...  I turned into fucking Otto all of a sudden.  Do you think stupid David Letterman stupid?  Who gives a shit?  Laszlo, what was the name of the strip club in Prague?  Dude, I don't tell you.  I was so full of abs that I don't even remember.  Did they suck your cock?  No, I nearly got thrown out, though.  For what?  Because Rocco Sofredi can fuck girls in the streets, and he can get thrown out of a strip club.  Were you behaving like a fat pig selfish fool?  I was behaving like a fat pig American. 
[02:06:30]  Where do you get the abs?  Know it all?  Dude, you can buy shots of it all over, Proud.  How many shots do you do before you're probably gone?  I did two.  And you're just gone.  And I was pretty blotto.  Well, I was also eating hash, but that's a...  Eating hash.  Might want to slow down a little bit.  Nice.  It's the reason I almost got thrown out of the strip club.  Because they've got all these, like, rusky accents, and they come over,  You want the privet to dance?  And I'm like, ah, moose and squirrel, and...  Oh, he's not making fun of him?  Yeah.  What is it with the Russian chicks now, or all dancers?  Russian chicks now, you can't go into a topless place without... 
[02:07:00]  Yes, you'll pay me the money, I will dance for you.  It's so ick.  Yeah, you have it.  It's the unsexiest accent ever.  I don't know.  They're all Russian broads.  I disagree.  I hate it.  Because their economy's kind of in the toilet, dude.  I like that.  It sounds like poverty.  I like that.  It sounds broke.  Yeah, but they don't got the...  They got the attitude, though.  Yeah, they got that attitude.  I'll tell you, attitude, somebody's got a real attitude, because suddenly I'm the only guy with my foot up on the console.  No, no, I still like this.  I feel like I want to lean forward a little bit.  Yeah, but, you know, if I'm going to copy you, we should have some sort of unity, like synchronize something. 
[02:07:30]  Well, I can't bend my legs like Mike Dino called it at Bantracite all over here.  I haven't seen Dino in a while.  How is he?  No one has.  Uh-oh.  What?  Oh!  Where's he been?  No, just literally.  Like, no...  I don't know.  I thought that was a jab at his career.  No, I like Dino.  He's a good guy.  I love Dino.  Is he still doing comedy?  I have no idea what's going on.  Hasn't contacted the show to get on either.  No, no, no.  Laszlo, strip club.  What the fuck is going on?  You tell a story like a guy that doesn't tell a story well. 
[02:08:00]  Russians.  You tell a story like you take it in the ass.  Why did he come to Cleveland for you to get beat by a million, Laszlo?  Why?  What?  What move is that from?  Yeah.  Who's got this stuffed teddy bear convention?  He's got you by the balls, Jake.  You gotta knock it out.  Don't tell the story anymore.  I just tried plowing through somebody talking.  Four pounds.  Keep working.  I tried plowing through it.  A little sliver.  Slow down.  No more.  It's like when you see that porn and they've got a teddy bear.  That just creeps me out when the chick's got the teddy bear in it.  Yeah, I agree.  And snakes and sand bother me, too. 
[02:08:30]  Sand?  Yeah, like when they fuck on the beach and they go to the sand all over them.  It's like, yeah, that's hot.  I gotta pick grains out of my mule and wonder if I have a disease and it's just sand.  Because sand's so clean these days.  At the Atlantis it is.  I gotta fly.  He walks the sand every morning.  He said he had a flight to the Atlantis.  To the Atlantis.  The Lost City.  That's what I was getting at.  I'm flying to the Lost City.  He's gonna meet Aquaman there.  Aquaman.  You know, he's not a bad guy.  Right. 
[02:09:00]  In the Ray tank.  This show is just a mess now.  Jay Moore was found guilty of rape on four counts.  That's why they canceled the show.  Alright, Laszlo.  Yes.  Didn't you hear Bonnie bombing on Jake on Howard?  Strip club.  They don't.  Absence.  You don't give the dollar bills to the chicks there.  No.  Nobody talks.  I'm telling you, it's fucking weird.  How do they get the money?  They come over after they're done dancing.  And they take you upstairs and bang you.  And have sex with them.  And you get thrown out of that? 
[02:09:30]  What do you have to do to get thrown out of that?  Don't get a fat ass out of the bathroom.  Why?  You met on my suit.  I'm sorry.  But a chick with a Russian accent who's wearing like a cowboy outfit with plastic guns.  I am cowboy.  I am cowboy.  I am cowboy.  I like that.  I am cowboy.  You get involved with sex?  Sex upstairs?  We'll make the fuck.  Right.  And you said no to sex upstairs?  Yeah.  I did.  Would you like to make the fuck berserker?  I did.  You married?  I said, yeah, because I'm married. 
[02:10:00]  What's wrong with you?  I know it's a different continent.  Yeah.  And a different legal system.  It's not cheating if there's money involved.  What a zilch.  Sorry.  I can't believe we're looking at a live shot of a smokestack.  I know.  Still no smoke.  I hope it comes out like red.  Some weird color and everyone scratches their head and all the...  Plonking heads are like, we haven't seen that color in over a hundred years.  So black means they haven't made a decision, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  There's a really...  No, no, white.  No, black came out yesterday.  Black means bad.  Yeah, white means they made a decision.  They fucked up the smoke yesterday. 
[02:10:30]  It started white and then it turned to black.  Everyone's like, yeah!  Oh.  Oh.  Just a bit outside.  It was like a long, long bubble.  What if they have like Vatican road flares or something that they light up?  That's what I don't know.  What are they putting in there to make...  Uh-oh, we got smoke.  Oh, oh, we got smoke.  It looks light.  It looks today.  The live feed's on the right.  Oh.  Oh.  See, look.  It's white.  We're watching reruns of a smoke stack.  It's white and everyone goes apeshit in the streets.  It's a little pink, actually.  Just the fact they have to have...  They're talking about how the smoke was pink yesterday. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  They have to have that fucking thing live.  And they've all got sparklers.  Can I try to jump in here for a second?  Come on, Opie.  Anyone else notice there's a...  Opie's talking!  Anyone else notice there's a crazy split screen here?  They've got Oklahoma City bombing on the left, and we're hoping for smoke on the right.  A smokestack on the right, and Oklahoma City bombing coverage on the left.  Do you ever notice you have...  Oh, okay, you don't.  Which...  I think it's both TVs on the same channel, and I was going to have fun with you.  I don't think today's the day that you should be hoping for smoke. 
[02:11:30]  Smoke's...  Oh, is that what you're getting at?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah.  They had enough smoke, and they already got the Oklahoma City thing on the left, and  then we're hoping for smoke on the right.  It's a little twisted.  What do you think they're all saying to each other right now?  I'll let you be Pope, if.  Right.  I want Mets tickets.  Yeah, they're making deals.  John Paul got to go to Shea.  Why can't I go to Shea?  Wheeling and dealing.  What the hell site are you on?  What are you looking at, Hawk? 
[02:12:00]  Erick's looking at...  The thing he was talking about.  Oh.  What was I talking about?  What?  QMOV.com?  One of the Germany clubs.  No, this wasn't in Germany.  You don't know what?  Fucking.  No, I did go to a goth club in Germany.  A goth club?  Yeah, dude.  Goth chicks are fucked up.  They're so weird.  What's this kid's name?  They're black lips.  They look dead.  All right.  Go to QMOV.com.  Piercings all over.  It'll be Jimmy and his favorite.  All I want is a nice, pure girl with a meat vagina that can just as easily fit onto a Brontosaurus.  And a credit card machine in her stomach. 
[02:12:30]  No, just a nice girl with just a meat box.  You like a meat box?  I really do.  I don't want her legs to be able to close all the way.  If she jumps down the steps, I want it to look like a bat's in front of her.  Let's take a break.  Like an Arby's brookie sandwich.  We have to regroup up.  This is a little nutty.  All right.  Why don't you go to commercial, Jimmy?  All right, guys.  You're here listening to the show today, and we have to go get my limo.  I've got my herni.  It's annoying.  That makes me sound like a really talented comic. 
[02:13:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Only creeps listen to this program.  That's right.  That's a bunch of lies.  Sit down and put on your laughing hat.  It's time for the Opie and Anthony show.  10202, the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to do Jay Moore all day?  We're going to do it all day?  Yeah, I guess we are.  What?  Part three?  Part three of Jay Moore in studio. 
[02:13:30]  The heretic.  Jay announces that he's done with stand-up.  Later, Frenchie calls and gets demolished by Jay and Company.  Ha, ha, ha.  Sounds like a little synopsis in a TV guide, doesn't it?  Jay and Company.  Well, let's see how it works out.  What do you say, Jim?  What do you say?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Here's some sexual reference.  Let ourselves go catch you by the end of the way.  No wonder blue light behind the shadow. 
[02:14:00]  That I'll just look at you by the end of the way.  No wonder blue light behind the shadow.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What a mess today, but having a lot of fun.  Our old pal Jay Moore in studio for the first time.  Hi, Bubby.  And, man, once again, just giving us great radio.  We call it ADD radio, but it's great radio.  And I don't know, the New York Post just sent us about 20 copies of the paper that you and I are featured in. 
[02:14:30]  As far as the big advertising they did, XM did on the back page, on the sports section.  We're like, I don't know, it's like an eighth of the back page is our characters saying, Opie and Anthony are back only on XM.  So they gave us like, I don't know, 20 copies of the paper.  And then there's an ad for Peter Jackson's new movie, King Kong, above the ad.  Wow, Jesus, dude.  Oh, no, it's, oh, sorry.  Sorry, I thought that was also an ad for a...  And, by the way, because Jay is too shy to mention this. 
[02:15:00]  August, I'm sorry, April 29th, 30th, I will be performing in Boston at Comedy Connection.  Oh.  Yes.  I retired from the club.  Did you really retire from any club performances?  Stand up.  What are you doing, theaters?  No.  What are you doing?  When I do theaters, nobody shows up.  What are you doing as far as your stand up?  Nothing.  Are you kidding?  Nope.  You sell out all clubs.  Yeah, but I can't do it anymore.  It's too much.  Why?  Have fun.  Because I don't love it anymore.  You don't?  And I always promised myself I wouldn't be one of those guys to stand up there and mail  it in, and now I never will. 
[02:15:30]  You're too busy with Nicky Cox.  That's the reason.  Now I'll do corporate shows and like a college here and there.  I can't do like fucking six shows a weekend, and I get anxiety, like almost like a panic.  And I'm medicated for panic.  It's all in my book, Gasping for Airtime, the LA Times bestseller, Two Years in the Treasures,  a Saturday Night Live.  But like I'll stand on stage and eight minutes in, I'm having a panic attack.  It's like, why don't you guys fucking talk?  I've been talking for 20 minutes.  I'm not even halfway done.  What exactly is it?  I get these weird things.  I'm not afraid of bombing.  I'm afraid I'm going to pass out.  I'm not going to be able to breathe.  I have these weird health fears.  Yeah.  That's how my fears trail. 
[02:16:00]  I want to be able to escape.  Yeah, I can't.  It's like keep the middle in the room in case I have to walk off.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I feel like someone's pushing on my throat.  I have to throw up.  I can't breathe.  It's like fucking you guys fucking talk.  I've been talking nonstop and I've heard this shit a billion times and I hate it.  I don't have any new shit.  They all hate.  Best commercial ever.  Caveman, Geico.  Oh, yeah.  That is not cool, man.  You know, you don't do it as simple.  Even a caveman could do it.  And the boom guy's a caveman.  He goes, that is not cool, man.  Not cool.  Walks off the set.  Come on, Jim, you fuck. 
[02:16:30]  And Jake doesn't watch television.  Jake, Jake, focus for a second.  I read your book and I really did like it a lot, but I was surprised you didn't talk  about the NyQuil thing.  I wasn't doing it then.  What do you mean?  I didn't do NyQuil until afterwards.  Yeah, but I thought you would add it in the books.  No?  Is it going to be like a part?  It was during the time when he was on SNL, right?  No.  Who's whispering?  No, I mean that one.  No one.  What's wrong?  I didn't do NyQuil until after.  Why do you think people are whispering on you?  That's weird.  I did NyQuil like four or five years ago when I was up in Calgary.  Was it only about the book? 
[02:17:00]  I haven't read it.  It's only about your time with SNL.  I'm trying all the SNL.  That's why I didn't have the...  I wasn't drinking beer then.  I was a full-on fucking drunk.  Real drinker.  I wasn't like, you know, sneaking in.  I didn't know there was a timeline with the book.  It starts getting Saturday Night Live.  No, I understand that.  And it ends not going back to Saturday Night Live.  So maybe the next book is NyQuil.  So you didn't read the book?  I swear to God I read the book.  Oh, I read your book.  I didn't realize it was a timeline.  I knew a lot about the SNL, but I'm thinking there was more stuff involved.  You're killing everyone around you, Leon. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  He says to me, read the book, you fat pig.  Wow, man.  All right.  Jesus, awful phone ring.  What the hell is that?  Oh, my God.  Well, that's...  You know, someone calling you when you're fucking being questioned by Alzar Cowley.  Hey, you guys, Frenchie's on the line.  Got to say hi to Frenchie.  Uh-oh.  You see the Hustler magazine, Jay?  I love it.  I want to see...  That's Pamela Law, by the way, that girl.  I think I want to see a picture of the girl that was cherry darts that was one of the...  That banged the intern and not Norton? 
[02:18:00]  Oh, God.  Don't get...  You know what?  You should have slapped her in her face and she would have went, sorry, Dad.  And after this, can you remind me just to trash Philly women?  Oh, really?  Again?  You are all a waste of time.  I agree.  You're calling cock teases.  The worst!  When you said that, I was in my car listening and I was very happy you said that.  The worst!  If you want to get some real head, you get your ass to Tampa.  They'll suck your dick.  They don't fuck around in Tampa.  I never had Tampa.  I had so many blowjobs in Tampa, I had to stand up during morning radio Friday from three blowjobs Thursday.  Just from fists pounding on my little ball bag. 
[02:18:30]  Well, I can only judge by O&A markets where good blowjobs are.  I don't know what head is like in Wisconsin.  But I can tell you one thing.  Fucking every girl in Boston fucks.  Boston rules.  Boston rules.  Cleveland is phenomenal.  Philadelphia, the amazing fans with the girls.  Every one of you is a time-wasting cock tease.  Fucking bitches.  Every one of you.  Do their accent when they're talking to you.  Hey, you know, I don't know.  I just wanted to come out and have some water. 
[02:19:00]  I mean, I didn't want to go home with you.  Yuck!  I didn't want to put that in my mouth.  Yuck!  It just has never worked out.  It fucking never works out.  All talk, no action.  Why did the Boston Herald send us like 20 copies of the paper?  What's in here that we're supposed to find?  Oh, right there, dude.  I've gone through it twice.  What the hell?  Why?  Oh, Jimmy, look at this.  Did a note come with this?  It said enjoy what?  Enjoy what?  Enjoy their paper. 
[02:19:30]  It's 20 copies.  Enjoy their publication.  Dude, it's 20 copies of an old paper, so I'm thinking there's something in here about us.  I can't find it.  Anyway, yeah, Hustler Magazine comes out, I think, next week.  We're in the July issue, 2005, of course.  I just had it.  Now I can't find it.  Now I'm stuck looking at naked girls.  It's awful.  Hustler was a great magazine to accidentally stumble upon when you were a kid, because  getting Playboy was cool, and Penthouse was better than Playboy, but getting your hands  on a Hustler back then, oh, man.  That was gold.  That was gold.  The holy grail. 
[02:20:00]  When you're walking through the woods, you kick over a pile of leaves, and just see that  colored print underneath, and go, what the?  Oh, someone's stash.  Just jacking like a monkey for hours on end.  What's in the hurl that we're supposed to find, Ben?  Best cartoon.  Huh?  Best cartoons, by the way.  Pick up Frenchies.  Hustler cartoons.  Playboy cartoons stink.  They try to be political.  Classy.  Oh, look, it's an elephant.  Ha-ha, Republicans.  You fucking stink.  But I'll tell you, Hustler cartoons are hilarious. 
[02:20:30]  Big throbbing cocks splitting girls in half.  I saw one funny one with Superman sitting there, and his dick is out, and there's a headless  chick kneeling, and there's a load dripping out of her mouth, and her head is blasted against  the fucking ceiling.  Oh, those cartoons always made me laugh.  Hey, Ben is telling us...  You're a head off.  Ben is telling us we really should go to Frenchie.  Oh, stop the presses.  Phone call.  It says that Jay is my bitch.  Frenchie.  Oh, this is going to be good.  Hello, guys.  What's up?  What's up? 
[02:21:00]  How you doing?  Good.  How you doing, Jay?  I'm sorry, what?  How many Frenchmen does it take to defend Paris?  20.  It's not known.  All right, here we go.  Let's get rolling.  I can...  I have my laughing hat on, ready to go.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, I'm ready, too.  For what?  For what?  Soap?  Yeah, if you're ass, you fuck.  Why is Jay your bitch? 
[02:21:30]  Because he's an ass, man.  He comes in here at my place, and then he trashes me.  Dude, it's not in your place.  You cook for this guy.  All right, now you got me.  Good, you got me.  You happy, you French faggot?  You fucking zero, you little tight, dude, you little tight bikini underwear, baby blue  underwear fag?  Dude, we've all been to Frenchie's place.  The food is excellent.  He's a waiter.  But the guy...  He's Eric Roberts.  The guy...  Wow.  We were slaves in there, Charlie.  What are you worried about your suit for, Frenchie? 
[02:22:00]  You ain't got no job to wear it to, man.  That's right, because you stole.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Start over.  Wait, wait, wait.  Frenchie, start over.  Start over.  Everyone was talking over.  Wait, what?  Frenchie, what?  Frenchie, listen.  Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Yes?  Start over.  Yeah, no one heard you.  Jesus.  Yeah, I heard.  Start over, Frenchie.  The one thing I want to say about Frenchie... 
[02:22:30]  You found my place, you fucking bitch.  That's what you do.  Dude, it's not your place.  You invite all of us to go to your restaurant, and then you might give us a free appetizer.  Yeah, you charge everyone.  No, no, no.  That's not an invite.  Joey Paisano invites us to his restaurant.  Everything's on that house.  That's right.  He poisons us for free.  Where's Joey?  You could bring ten of your friends down at Paisano's.  You're not paying a dime.  And you know what?  Because Joey knows the importance of repeat business.  You just got to grease everyone's palm when you go in there.  Frenchie invites us all down saying it's his restaurant. 
[02:23:00]  He barely is a cook, and then you get a bill.  He's not a cook.  He was walking around with a fucking pad and paper like a common bitch at Friday's.  Yeah, right.  Is he wearing flair?  And then your bill comes up.  He's wearing buttons.  Your bill comes, and the only reason you're going there is because you get the invite,  and it's like $250, $300 for a meal.  Luke, I give you a free dessert.  You're fucking lying.  I don't want a free dessert.  How about a free whole thing?  I had my book signing in Manhattan, and afterwards, you were all over me for like years. 
[02:23:30]  How many free shows of mine did you come to see?  So $300 in passive income.  I saw one of your show, man.  Only one of them.  Frenchie.  What are you talking about?  Frenchie.  Yeah?  Can I finish?  What?  Can I finish?  Let's say finish, Frenchie.  Can I finish?  Yeah, I finish.  You come to all my shows, and you say, come to my restaurant.  It's great.  I take care of you.  Da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  So then I go to your restaurant.  I bring everyone from Hyperion Publishing.  Like, oh, no, I know a guy. 
[02:24:00]  We'll go up.  It's on the arm.  Let me take you guys out.  Because when you're with the publishers, like, they're not going to let you pay.  You're like their new star because you just released a book.  So they're going to have to pay.  So it's like a 22-year-old girl that works for Hyperion in French.  You just, like, like a fucking brick, just, bow, $250 check.  Like the fucking stone tablet story of the bill he drops.  Like a fucking limb.  Like impending danger.  He's on my back.  And I go, what the fuck is this?  And he goes, please, could you keep your voices down? 
[02:24:30]  He told us to keep our voices down.  It's us and one other couple of French fucking faggot old people sitting around comparing stinks and uncircumcisions.  And then you drop the check and tell us to keep our voices down.  You make me look like a real jerk.  Put a check in front of me in front of my friends.  Oh, man.  He's going to grab him by his little tie and put a bottle over his head.  And then look at the other French waiter and go, what the fuck are you looking at?  All right, Frenchie, now it's your turn.  All right, go ahead, French.  Well, the fucking people that were there, those fucking people go there all the time, okay? 
[02:25:00]  So you can't just, like, come there and start cursing around in the restaurant.  Well, yeah, I can.  Do you understand?  He's a movie star.  He can do as he pleases you.  You want to be in page six?  That's what I do.  I show up and you get in page six.  Hey, we saw Jay Moore with Hyperion and Nicky Cox.  They were at Frenchie's fucking, the place that his uncle used to own that they still let him work because he stole.  Yeah, my ass.  Fuck.  So far, Jay is really your bitch.  Yeah, well, you can have a bitch anyway.  But first of all, you just don't do that no matter where you go. 
[02:25:30]  Good point, Mark.  Good point.  Shut up.  You made a good point that right is right and wrong is wrong.  How about another non-cliché?  Oh, please.  A nunnin?  No, I caught myself too.  You are dropping, faggot.  A nunnin.  Frenchie, what was the deal?  But all you ever say is, come to this restaurant.  It's my restaurant.  What's the name of it?  I don't know.  You can plug it.  No one's going to show up.  It doesn't matter.  They're going to come by and burn it down if I say the name. 
[02:26:00]  So there you go.  Anthony knows the name.  Why don't you ask him?  All right.  Because we're talking to you, you fucking zero.  Yeah.  I don't want to come in from my mouth, you fucko.  Did Anthony get a free meal?  Did he get a free meal there, Ant?  No.  I'm just, I'm being honest.  I'm being honest.  I gave you free bread.  I never, I never complained that I didn't get a free meal, but I never got a free meal.  Not only does he not give you anything for free, he's, he has you trying all sorts of 
[02:26:30]  stuff.  You're like, yeah, it's a nice place.  You know, and he's just adding up every little taste.  You were like, this is from the kitchen.  It's cock pate.  It's like shit you would never order ever, like liver, like fucking faux de gras, all  this shit.  I think French food stinks anyway.  No offense, man.  I might say your restaurant's not good, but I don't like French food.  Italian is the only one that I like.  Also, he's got three or four appetizers on the table.  You think, oh, he wants me to taste some stuff.  And it's all right on the bill.  Me and Anthony and Opie, we go down to Joey Paisano's. 
[02:27:00]  We sit down.  By the time our asses eat the seed, boom, fried ravioli on the table.  I'll never even ask for it.  What they do?  What they fucking do?  What about it?  I've taken, I went to dinner at Frenchy's there and took Big Kev and Stinky, Mary, a couple  other people were with us, too.  It was like a big party.  Jimmy Robinson.  Jimmy Robinson.  Helen came.  Helen.  And what happened?  And I got it.  Again, like you said, Jake.  What happened that night at the Colby? 
[02:27:30]  The big stone tablet check.  Why they got mad?  I smacked him around.  I knocked his food off the table.  The Ten Commandments check.  The Ten Commandments check.  Here it is.  Kabam!  Thou shalt pay for the appetizer.  Oh, the chef wanted me to tell you thank you, and the sherbet is on the house.  Thanks, chef.  That if you weren't here, you'd be in fucking France driving a cab, stinking people out.  No, I'd be working in a nice restaurant in France, not like you.  Then go!  Then fucking go there, you fucking cocksucker. 
[02:28:00]  I'm sick of that shit.  I'm going to move to Canada.  I don't like this war.  I'm going to get out of the country.  Fucking go!  All of you.  Everyone fucking get out, you fucking faggots.  Every motherfucker that says anything about leaving this country, do me a fucking favor.  Kill me!  Joey Salve me!  See, I did that for you, Jimmy.  I got it, too.  But if anyone's wondering why Jay no longer hosts fucking when Regis isn't available,  it's because I want Kelly Ripley to use my face as a wash rag. 
[02:28:30]  Frenchy, what else?  What else, Frenchy?  No, I like it here.  I love it to be in the United States, man.  It's a lot more to do.  All right, bye-bye, Frenchy.  Come on, there's ten seconds left.  We're going to waste it on this fucking French faggot.  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Because you're smart.  You're not dumb, like people think.  XM 202, the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning, it's Opie and Anthony, and of course, little Jimmy Norton.  Don't forget to pick up your latest Jim Norton CD at eatabullet.com.  Hey, hey.  The name of the CD is very, very hard to remember, so Jimmy, if you will. 
[02:29:00]  Trinkets I own, made from gorilla hands.  That's right.  A, ooh.  What, it's all right.  The only dumb question is the one not asked.  A plug out of nowhere is what I was going to say.  Very happy.  Just out of nowhere.  Boom, plug.  Wow.  Crazy.  Insane.  Where did that name come from for the CD?  It was a goof of things.  I had a list of lists.  Like, I made up a list of, like, list titles.  Of course, there was no list, but, like, one of the list titles was the 50 funniest moments 
[02:29:30]  in child pornography.  Important political functions I've spoiled by loudly defecating into my pants.  And one was trinkets I own, made from gorilla hands.  Right.  You know, because you always hear these horror stories about gorillas who were murdered in  the Congo so their hands can be used as ashtrays.  Table legs.  Yeah.  So it was just, to me, a very funny and silly name for a list of, like, I implied that I  had many trinkets made from the hands of these beautiful creatures.  And some fan, a guy named John Hawley, sent me this, like, watercolor drawing he did of 
[02:30:00]  me with trinkets I own made from gorilla hands with a little thing around my neck as a goof.  And I liked it.  I was honored.  So I hung it on my wall.  And when I decided to do this CD, I said, uh, Manny had died from the comedy cellar.  I said, I want that picture of me and Manny to be the only photo on the CD.  The rest is going to be all fan art, which I was inspired to.  Yeah.  By this drawing.  So fans submitted it.  And, uh, Fat Pigs Deserved to Cry was almost the title.  Yeah.  But I had a personal reason for not putting that. 
[02:30:30]  And also, I, uh, just felt that it wasn't something I created.  A personal reason?  I kind of felt it's stupid.  Like, Ozzy didn't want to put, Ozzy didn't want to put, uh, Speak of the Devil with Randy  Rhodes' name, and I kind of felt creepy putting something with, did it to Cry and then having  Manny on the back.  It just kind of, yeah.  Oh, I got you.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  Well, your comments on the, uh, artwork, on the fan art, it's very, very funny.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  It could be simple where you could just write something for it, but you really took a weird  twist with it, and it's very funny.  You talked about it like it was real art.  Yeah, you did.  You talked about it like it's real art, and it's hysterically funny. 
[02:31:00]  You can get a copy on eatabullet.com.  That became the cover, obviously.  Uh, bad guest day, Anthony.  Yes.  We love this bit.  We got to start doing more of these.  Mm-hmm.  Haven't done it in a while, but, uh, this was the time that the other Dr. Smith called  in.  Now, you might think, who's the other Dr. Smith?  We all know Dr. Smith from Lost in Space.  That pedophile that was along with the Jupiter II, uh, uh, molesting young William.  Well, who's this other Dr. Smith?  A gentleman named Dr. Smith calls in to plug his new sex pill, but it, but it's so dull and 
[02:31:30]  boring.  I remember this guy.  He was really dull and boring.  Yeah.  And then we started, uh, doing all sorts of Lost in Space references.  We're idiots.  And then we find out he's not even a doctor.  He just added that so it would sound good and sell pills.  This guy was just a disaster.  Bad guest.  I bet.  Textbook bad guest.  I bet a lot of money that this guy just gave up on his own life.  He just jumped out a window.  I guarantee it.  We, you know, maybe someone could do the research to see if this guy's still alive. 
[02:32:00]  Bad guest day with the other Dr. Smith.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you.  What, what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, Dr. Smith's on the line.  Dr. Smith?  Yes.  Oh, dear.  I love Jane Lost in Space.  Hello.  Yes.  Young boy.  Yes, William.  Hello, Dr. Smith.  Hello.  Hello.  How are you today?  Why don't you tell our listeners what you do? 
[02:32:30]  I'm an osteopathic physician.  I do natural wellness in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Yes, indeed you do.  You have a book out, do you?  No, not a book.  What do you have?  A product.  Woo!  A product?  Yes.  You're a doctor?  I sure am.  I am, too, Dr. Smith.  You're a doctor of what?  I never really knew.  What type of doctor was I?  Yes.  A pediatrician?  Yes. 
[02:33:00]  Gynecologist?  Oh, dear.  Spare me the poisonous bobs, Dr. Smith.  Dr. Smith, do you know who Dr. Smith is?  I certainly do.  Yes.  What's your product, sir?  It's a mood product.  It's called Golden Mood.  Golden Mood?  Yes.  You sure you're not a dentist?  Because this is going to be like pulling teeth.  No, it's called Golden Mood. 
[02:33:30]  It's for people who have the blues.  Are you taking his product?  Yes, I am.  Wow, geez.  There's an endorsement.  Give some to Major West.  He's such a prick to me.  That was what?  I didn't catch that.  It says here, doctor, that more people die from medical mistakes each year than from highway accidents.  Is that statistically true?  Yes, it is.  Who cares?  Well, I don't get it, though. 
[02:34:00]  Everything I've read about you, Dr. Smith, has to do with medical, like, mistakes and whatnot.  But then, the first thing you mention is this product.  Yes.  Is it an antidepressant?  Pardon me?  Is it an antidepressant?  Look at Rick.  Rick is now going, oh, no, I'm so dead.  Is Golden Mood an antidepressant? 
[02:34:30]  It's more of a mood support product.  You could say that it has herbals in it that work as an antidepressant.  Big Kev, do you have a guest for us?  The guy in the suit, maybe?  Maybe the guy in the Lost in Space suit?  I probably could call him.  Dr. Smith.  Was his name May?  Bob May.  Bob May.  It says, are meds killing your sex drive?  Does this help with that, Golden Mood?  Help with your sex drive?  Yes.  This guy killing our show.  Well, it won't kill your sex drive. 
[02:35:00]  No, no, I'm saying because I've noticed that my sex drive has been down, and I'm trying to get substitute teaching jobs to get it going again.  No, I don't think it'll help with your sex drive.  So what does it do?  It's a mood support product for people who have problems with depression-type problems.  Rather than going on strong antidepressants, they can go on something a little mellower, like the Golden Mood. 
[02:35:30]  How does it work?  Yeah, I know.  I wasn't paying attention that time.  Dr. Smith, you sound depressed.  You sound like a robot.  You're on this product, and it doesn't seem to be perking you up.  It doesn't perk me up?  No.  No, Dr. Smith.  What medication are you taking, Dr. Smith?  I don't take any medications.  Aren't you taking your Golden Mood product?  Yes, I am.  Warning, warning.  This product increases boredom on radio programs. 
[02:36:00]  Warning, warning.  You have the energy of a rock.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  You know, our Dr. Smith used to do things where we wanted to leave him on a planet.  Right now, I'm thinking I want you on another planet.  Please, Dr. Smith, do something exciting.  I think I feel like I'm on another planet.  Back to the Jupiter, too. 
[02:36:30]  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  You suck.  Thank you.  I mean, you're on a radio show.  It is a medium for speaking.  You drone on and on like a bledianchor from the planet Furiaton.  Warning, warning.  This is time.  We will never get back.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir. 
[02:37:00]  Have you ever been on the radio before?  Let's start there.  I sure have.  This is sort of a new experience.  Where's young William?  Have you slipped him a Mickey?  You have your own radio show.  I do.  Oh, even the robot's laughing.  Don't give anyone a radio show, huh?  Yeah, that's true.  If you pay some money, they'll give you one.  Ah, wobble doodle.  I understand.  Just like me, the grease man. 
[02:37:30]  Warning.  Doug from Springfield wants to know if he's on the Zoloft from keeping from boring us all.  Dr. Smith, do you realize you are not that exciting?  Absolutely.  I'm a pretty exciting guy.  I guess I'm slightly intimidated.  What do you do for excitement there, Doc?  What do I do?  Yeah.  Go to theater and go skiing and...  What kind of theater?  Go gambling.  We have some pretty nice theater stuff in Cincinnati. 
[02:38:00]  A lot of the Broadway stuff comes here.  We took a gamble on this booking and lost.  What was the last show you went to for fun?  Blast.  Did you have a blast at Blast?  It was great.  I loved it.  Wow.  What a rousing endorsement for Blast.  It's no stomp.  But it's better than the Blue Man Group.  And you ski?  A little bit.  Yeah, I have.  I haven't went... 
[02:38:30]  Obviously, I haven't went yet this year, but I think probably in the spring I'll go.  Yeah, obviously, because we know all about you.  Right.  Obviously.  You failed to mention that in the last ten times we talked on the phone at home.  Were you around when Larry Flint got shot in Cincinnati?  No, I wasn't here then.  He did get shot there, though, right?  I don't know if he got shot in Cincinnati.  I know he's got some hustler stores here.  Ah.  In the area.  Pornography.  So how could he die from your medication?  From my medication? 
[02:39:00]  Not your medication.  Oh, from medication.  Taking too many pills?  Wow.  You are really breaking some ground with that statement.  Too bad you couldn't talk to Marilyn Monroe.  You idiot.  We could have saved Janice and Jimmy.  Holy ass.  You could die if you take too many pills, kids.  Dr. Earl, is your product being sold successfully over the Internet, or can people get it in stores? 
[02:39:30]  It's sold over the phone.  Oh, yeah?  It's mail order.  And how would one go about getting your product?  There's an 800 number they can call.  Oh, what's the 800 number?  888.  888.  Wonderful.  Wait, wait, what?  Dr. Smith.  Yes.  Dr. Smith, we were losing your communication.  Yeah, what happened when he wanted you to give out that 1-800 number for your product? 
[02:40:00]  What was that number again?  888.  And this way you will get the product.  Dr. Smith, are you there, Dr. Smith?  Yes, I am.  Is there a problem with your phone?  You must be calling on a cell phone.  Yeah, that's it.  I'm on a cell phone.  Yeah, okay.  Do I detect sarcasm?  My sensors pick up sarcasm, Dr. Smith.  No, you wouldn't get any sarcasm from me. 
[02:40:30]  That sounds sarcastic.  Are you a married fellow?  No, sir.  More surprises.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dr. Smith, do you have a boyfriend?  No, I don't.  Girlfriend?  Not really.  Dating.  Dating what?  Girls.  Another robot?  Another robot?  Ha, ha, ha.  Do you slip her a Mickey?  Ha, ha.  Well, if that's what you call it.  Very energetic. 
[02:41:00]  Oh.  You're as exciting as bone cancer.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  How long has, uh, type of comment is that?  How long has, uh, golden, um, mood been, uh, on the market?  Probably about 30 days.  Who cares?  30 days?  Are you selling a lot?  I really haven't checked yet.  I've just started doing radio interviews. 
[02:41:30]  Because it says that you want to make, it's supposed to make people's mood better.  Is it a bottle with an old person falling down steps in it?  No, but that, that might work, I suppose.  It's for some people.  Oh, you ever see an old hip bone shatter?  Cheers you right up.  What type of doctor are you?  Family practice.  Do you get to see the young ones naked?  Not anymore.  Why?  Court order.  Since the court order.  Because of the court order.  I remember Dr. Smith used to like young William. 
[02:42:00]  Is that correct, Dr. Smith?  You liked young Will Robinson.  How did you find that out?  You are a kid toucher.  I saw the episodes, Dr. Smith.  Why would the Robinson family allow a pedophile to roam around foreign planets with Dr. Smith?  Hey, we got someone on the line that has tried the product.  What is it called again, Doc?  Golden Mood.  Golden Mood.  Golden Mood.  Warning.  And you're on it, and it peps you up, right? 
[02:42:30]  Absolutely.  There's a guy, his name's Dave.  He has tried your product.  Let's see what he thinks of the product.  Dave.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  I tried Dr. Smith's product, and it really, really pepped me up.  Last week, I went lawn bowling, and I find myself full of energy and pep, and I am able  to enjoy life a lot better now.  Well, that's a rousing endorsement for Dr. Smith's product.  I appreciate that. 
[02:43:00]  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  To a great degree.  I'm going to go throw myself off the Golden Gate Bridge now.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Well, Dave enjoys the product, Dr. Smith.  Well, I'm glad.  I'm glad it helped Dave out.  Do you have any celebrity endorsements besides Kurt Cobain?  No, I don't.  Can you imagine this guy off of the product?  Is it possible I could melt those pills down for a golden shower?  What were you like off the medication, Dr. Smith? 
[02:43:30]  I was boring.  God, you should be a Canadian.  That was funny.  All right.  Ah, wow.  All right.  Well, let me go to Alan here.  Alan.  Hello, Dr. Smith.  I have a serious question for you.  Yes.  If I use this product, Golden Mood, will it ease my bum hole after anal?  Well, a very serious question for you.  Will it ease your what hole? 
[02:44:00]  My bum hole.  You know, Dr. Smith, the balloon knot, the back door, the rear entry.  Um, probably, absolutely.  Absolutely it will help.  Wow.  Now I'm excited about this product, Dr. Smith.  Well, uh, Dr. Smith?  Yes.  So it'll ease the pain of the back door?  Absolutely.  Everything feels better.  Eli.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  How are you guys doing?  Oh, good.  We're talking to Dr. Smith. 
[02:44:30]  I have a problem, Dr. Smith.  Um, I get down a lot and depressed, and sometimes the only thing that cheers me up is, uh, whacking  my girlfriend a couple times.  If I take your product, uh, if I take your product, will it help me out?  It'll give you the stamina that you need.  Oh.  There you go.  No problem.  I, I, I, but, Doc, I think if you're beating up your, your wife, your girlfriend, you don't  want stamina, you idiot.  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  Oh, we have another call on the line? 
[02:45:00]  Hi, who's this?  Hi, this is Mike Tyson.  Hey, Mike.  Hi, Dr. Smith?  Yeah, Mike.  Dr. Smith.  S-M-I-F.  I could spell that one.  Dr. Smith, can I stop taking the Zoloft and go on this and still be in a mood where I  don't kill y'all.  Um, are you still on?  I would love to punch you in your face.  You still on your lithium, Mike?  I need the lithium and the Zoloft.  I would take, I would, I would lay down.  I would say, thank you, Dr. Smith. 
[02:45:30]  And I would take the, the golden mood, right?  I would swallow it.  I would wait till it takes effect.  And then I put my big foot up your ass.  That's what I would do.  I would kick you so hard in your ass that you would actually maybe even for a second get  a personality.  This is awful.  I don't know.  It's pretty funny.  What, uh, made you get into, uh, looking to pioneer a golden mood if I could?  What got me into natural wellness or? 
[02:46:00]  Natural wellness.  What is natural wellness?  I've never heard that term.  I just don't use medications in my practice anymore.  It's all holistic.  It's all holistic.  Holistic medication.  Spirit, mind, and body.  But is that good for like tumors and stuff?  Um, no, I mean, there, there's, there's a place for medications.  Medications are important and they work.  Just taking too many of them.  What would you, um, uh, give a tumor?  A tumor?  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Um, what kind of a tumor?  Uh, uh, a malignant tumor?  What kind of a malignant tumor?  You have the charisma of George Harrison today.  Sir, let's just say that my rods aren't what they used to be.  Your rods aren't what they used to be?  Yeah.  Can it help with the boners?  Why am I talking on this?  Can it help with the boners?  Can it help with the boners?  Probably Viagra. 
[02:47:00]  Was that another joke?  Yeah.  Can you give him a laugh?  Oh.  Doc, you're awful.  Wow.  You, I gotta tell you something.  What's happening?  You are absolutely the worst radio guest we've ever had on this show.  You are probably, and I'm not, I'm not even being wacky, probably the most boring guy we've  ever spoken to.  But you'll remember me.  I know.  Because I'm the worst.  I've never been the best at anything. 
[02:47:30]  True.  So I'll be the worst.  But Doc, if you're going to promote a product that's going to pep you up, shouldn't you go  on the radio really peppy?  Do some cocaine or smoke some crack before you do these radio interviews.  You have the energy of a sloth.  You working on anything else?  Holistic medicine.  Are you working on a personality?  Anything like that?  Yeah, I've got other products in the making.  I guess I'm going to have to do some therapy or something.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  So why don't you give out the phone number for...  The phone number is 888-255.  And we got operators standing by?  Absolutely.  Dr. Smith, I have to ask you something.  Sure.  You say you're a family practice?  Right.  Yet you don't prescribe any type of drugs?  Nope.  All right.  Can we play a game?  Absolutely.  What year was Dr. Smith's license taken away?  Can we play that? 
[02:48:30]  And why?  And why?  And why?  Can we play?  Yeah.  When did he get out of drug therapy himself?  Was that it?  Yeah, no.  You started dipping into the medicine cabinet yourself?  A little morphine.  Oh, need morphine.  I think there's a story with Dr. Smith.  There's some kind of story because there's no family practice.  This guy that doesn't prescribe the dope.  It was at the same time when I quit doing the pelvic exams on the women.  Oh, the pelvic exam.  The pelvic exam.  Was there some type of touching thing that happened?  It was the pedophile, the drug thing.  It was the whole thing. 
[02:49:00]  It was so stressful.  It just all came together.  Yeah.  Dr. Smith, I'm being serious here.  There has to be a story why you're not prescribing drugs to people.  Did you ever prescribe drugs to people?  Sure.  Yeah, I worked for 20 years.  20 years.  And then what happened?  Something happened.  Something happened.  What happened to change your outlook on medicine?  Well, I had to come up with one incident, I guess.  You know, you're probably right. 
[02:49:30]  I lived in Branson, Missouri.  Uh-huh.  And my mom died from overuse of medication.  Wrong kind.  Sorry to hear that, Dr. Smith.  Sorry.  I appreciate the symbolism.  Wow.  So it was over medication.  Jim is in a corner right now.  From over medication.  Right.  All right.  What was the drug of choice?  What was the drug of choice?  Of your...  Like what was the ailment and what was prescribed and how did it happen? 
[02:50:00]  Of your dear old mom.  It was just an anti-inflammatory.  You know, she just...  Her stomach, she bled to death.  Sorry.  No, that's...  That's depressing.  It wasn't you that prescribed it, though, right?  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  Just because that would have been even more tragic.  Why was she taking the drug?  It was because of some kind of...  Arthritis.  Arthritis, yeah.  Arthritis.  Right.  Is that arthritis of the stomach?  No, arthritis.  And then she took an anti-inflammatory, and I guess she was over-medicated, and it caused 
[02:50:30]  her stomach to bleed?  Mm-hmm.  Did it explode?  No, it wouldn't explode.  It would just kind of bleed open.  Yeah, it bleeds.  So did she get bloated and stuff?  No.  Why didn't anybody see this happening and maybe...  When it happens, it happens pretty quick.  Was it?  Yeah.  Well, what happens?  She just...  She bled, and they tried to take her stomach out, and she died on the operating table.  Wow. 
[02:51:00]  Huh.  Jeez.  So then you decided that medication was no good, right?  Huh?  Yeah.  That kind of...  Bad medication.  That kind of put you over the line?  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Here's one for the old-timers.  You mean me?  Wow.  So that...  Then you went into holistic medicine.  How old were you when your mom died, if I may ask? 
[02:51:30]  45, I'll say.  All right, Dr. Smith, thank you so much.  Okay, buddy.  You want to give out that phone number once again?  No.  Why wouldn't...  Hey, that's the best, funniest thing you've said.  Why wouldn't you want to give out the phone number?  I'm insulted.  No.  What's the matter, Dr. Smith?  You okay?  It's like Linus and the football or something, you know?  It's like I'm going to be kicking the football.  Nope, I'm not going to do it.  Dr. Smith. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, now you're going to make us feel bad.  No, no, no.  Give it out for the plug.  Give it out for the plug.  Give it out for the plug.  What's going on Wednesday over there with this wow thing?  Wow?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I don't know anything about wow.  Oh, come on, guys.  You're more depressing than old yeller.  I just talked to a friend of mine in New York, and he told me that on Wednesdays you guys  do a wow thing.  Really?  Yeah, whip them out Wednesday.  Girls like flash guys on the way home if they see wow in their car.  Yeah, like why couldn't you call me on Wednesday?  Maybe that would have put me in a better mood. 
[02:52:30]  You're in a bad mood?  Why?  I'm not in a bad mood.  Did we get off to a bad start?  No, no.  I just don't.  Why don't you free your mind here?  Why don't you tell us what you think of us?  You all right?  What do I think of you guys?  You all right?  You all right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're a lot of fun.  You sound a little...  It sounds like you're going to take a warm bath and slit your wrists after you hang up  the phone.  You have any friends, Dr. Smith?  Do I have any friends?  Yeah, you got any friends?  I think I got a couple.  That's good.  All right.  You get laid? 
[02:53:00]  You said he's dating, Hope.  It hasn't been real recent I haven't gotten laid, no.  You want us to get you laid?  Out in New York?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  You made up that over-medicating story, right?  She died from boredom of one of your visits.  I'm not even a doctor.  You're not?  You what?  I'm not even a doctor.  Then why are you Dr. Smith?  Well, I had to come up with something.  Hold the phone.  What?  You're doing...  You said that you practiced 20 years and you were an emergency room doctor. 
[02:53:30]  I know, but Dr. Smith couldn't take the call and he asked me to come in here and sit  and talk on the phone.  He said there were a couple of jerks from New York calling me and he wanted to...  He said he's trying to be whacking.  I think you're lying, Dr. Smith.  No, I'm not.  You're Dr. Smith.  No, no.  No, I'm not.  Dr. Smith would never have somebody else come on when he has something to talk about.  That's right.  No, he was busy and he just asked me to come on and sit here and...  I give you credit.  It's a good out.  I like it.  Okay.  I like it. 
[02:54:00]  I want people to think that you really are a bore because you want people to buy your product.  I understand all that.  That's okay.  And then...  Kirksville College.  And the mom's death thing, pretty sad.  That was sad.  Very sad.  I understand that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, thank you, Dr. Smith.  Okay, guys.  Good luck with the product.  You sure you don't want to give the number out again?  I really feel bad now.  And you know what?  Ant and I, we like to goof around, but when it's over and done with, we like to make good.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:54:30]  I'm serious.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dr. Smith, you were a good sport.  You took our abuse.  You took everything we threw at you.  You didn't hang up.  You hung in there.  You're a good guy.  So we got our fun out of you, and now we should make good.  Okay.  You ready?  The phone number.  888.  Right.  Go ahead.  I didn't do nothing yet.  248.  Right. 
[02:55:00]  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, Dr. Smith.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  There he is.  Our new pal, Dr. Smith.  Dr. Smith.  We better keep in touch with that guy.  I like him.  He's going to kill himself soon.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Party radio with Dr. Smith.  That was some of the most uncomfortable radio I've ever heard.  You actually left your seat and walked into the corner when Ovi played the canned laughter  over the mom's story.  That was probably the worst use of canned laughter I've ever, ever heard. 
[02:55:30]  Wait.  Russ wants to say something.  Russ, what's up?  Man, I know you go for the cringe radio thing, but with the mom on the operating table and  taking out the stomach, oh.  You're going to hell, guys.  You are all going straight to hell.  Norton, you rule.  Thanks, man.  Later.  Okay.  Goddamn.  Goddamn up-tempo number after mom dying. 
[02:56:00]  Hi.  Linus and the football.  Linus and the football.  Linus.  Very good analogy from the very boring Dr. Smith.  I'm not Dr. Smith.  Except it's Charlie Brown.  I know.  I know, but I didn't want to correct it.  It's so funny.  He's just like, I'm not Dr. Smith.  Then he's like, I'm not Dr. Smith.  That guy was...  What?  Great job.  Great booking.  Great booking.  Thank God we could go with just about anything with this radio program. 
[02:56:30]  Imagine a real radio show that had to have him on.  What would they do?  So tell us more about your practice.  It's a new structure thing.  Today is Autistic Tuesday.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Or to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the Truth Roll-Up Factory.  Making a Truth Roll-Up.  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that's so much better than your American... 
[02:57:00]  Because I, you know, what do you...  Let me just...  Well, you already know, but...  You don't want to work.  Work good for you.  Right.  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad, and it stunk so bad.  You fat American...  Right.  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should need to know.  Okay.  Back to work.  XM 202. 
[02:57:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Why don't you intro this next thing here?  Wheelchair Fred.  Dildo in ass.  This is our buddy up there in Boston.  Wheelchair Fred.  Confined to a wheelchair.  Well, he's got to pleasure himself, and he's chosen quite a unique way for a guy to pleasure himself.  A dildo.  And he uses it in the bathtub, and we totally get into it here.  Wheelchair Fred.  Dildo in ass.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm sure people might not want to go with what I'm about to say. 
[02:58:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  But I just got an idea.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  You can either go with it or turn the channel.  All right.  Now, Fred, you say you're real desperate, and life blows, and you can't get a woman out there,  and you don't want guys anymore.  Yeah.  I must be ugly.  And you're stuck with the dildo, right?  You got it. 
[02:58:30]  I really think you need to show people out there your plight and how desperate you really are,  and what you have to do to get satisfaction.  And I think that might help your life.  How would he do that?  But don't you know, there's more snow around here.  I haven't been out.  He hasn't been outside in a while because there's a lot of snow in the area.  For a month.  I'm thinking, you know, he might want to give us a little demonstration today. 
[02:59:00]  No!  Because I honestly don't think people understand how desperate Fred is.  Jim?  I do think that if you show that desperation a little bit, you'd be much more likely to  get some emails from some girls who are willing to strap one on and give it to you.  Yeah, because at this point, I think after the demonstration, I'm just thinking that people  are going to feel sorry for you, and there's going to be a few women out there that are going  to feel sorry for you.  And I think they're going to start emailing you. 
[02:59:30]  You think this is a surefire way for him to get girls?  Short thing.  You want girls, right, Fred?  You'll get pity.  What?  I'll get pity.  You'll get pity, but I think you'll get girls emailing you.  It's kind of like the girls that write prisoners and stuff.  They're out there, Fred, I'm telling you.  But I don't think they understand how sad and desperate you are, so I think a little demonstration  would really, really...  Fred, you want to get ready? 
[03:00:00]  Oh, what do you think, Fred?  I think I'm going to buy a hooker.  You think you'll go and buy a hooker?  No, you don't make much money, Fred.  You're not...  I think you're missing the point.  Yeah, I think Fred's missing the point here.  Fred, are you at your place right now?  Yeah.  You're at your place.  You have your...  I'm at home.  Ah, shut up.  You have your dildo with you?  Yeah, it's in the bathroom. 
[03:00:30]  It's in the bathroom, and you have...  And you have a...  What kind of lubrication do you use?  I have some strawberry flavored KY also.  Ah, strawberry flavored KY?  No, I got regular flavor.  Oh, you got regular KY.  Okay.  You don't need a flavor.  It's going to look like Rocky Road when it's done.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Rocky Road.  You don't want to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
[03:01:00]  Well, Fred, why don't you roll into the bathroom and get your dildo?  No, Fred.  I've got a little more class than that.  What?  I've got a little more class than that.  That's a little more class than that.  Freddie.  Fred.  A little more class than that.  He took one in the ass from a guy he met at the deli.  Fred.  Yeah.  We're not looking for...  We're not looking for...  What, guys?  It's tough for God's sake.  What'd you say? 
[03:01:30]  You have more class than that?  Yeah.  I've got more class than that.  As I turn off everyone's mics, we'll see about that.  All right.  As we continue.  Oh, Fred.  I'll put this way.  Okay, listen to this.  Fred, Fred.  Here's the deal.  Listen to this.  I don't even think I have a match.  Fred.  Fred, listen to me.  Stop a minute.  Listen to me.  We're not looking for an all-out sex act.  We're just looking for you to get your dildo from the bathroom, your KY jelly, and to just  place it where you like it to be placed. 
[03:02:00]  That's all I'm saying.  Just to show the people how desperate you are.  Live here on the radio, Fred.  Yeah, and then that's it.  Then it ends.  As soon as you say it's where it has to be, then that's it.  Then girls will know that you're for real.  And believe me, there's a couple of freaky chicks out there that would probably love to  help you.  No, Fred, you're too much of a pain in the ass.  Fred?  That's the goal, Fred.  Fred?  I made you difficult to do.  Fred, Fred, roll in and get your dildo. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  That's all we're asking.  Go get your dildo.  This will make great radio.  Does it vibrate?  Do you have any alcohol in there?  No, it's rubber.  Oh, it's rubber?  Okay, get your dildo.  We want to hear what the dildo sounds like when you smack it on your phone, so go get it.  Never mind, I don't want to do it.  I'll take a couple of them for the life.  I want to hear what the dildo sounds like.  What is he doing?  He's rolling around his place.  What the hell is he doing? 
[03:03:00]  Fred?  No, I don't hear you.  Fred, go get your dildo.  Get your dildo and knock it on the receiver of your phone so we can hear it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, go ahead.  Come on.  We're in the middle of a show here.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm on my way.  You're on your way?  Go get your dildo.  All right, he's on his way to the bathroom to get the dildo.  Okay.  I'm turning the mic off for a second here.  I'm just buggered. 
[03:03:30]  He's in the bathroom.  Oh, Jesus.  What a mess.  I've got my rubber magic tongue.  He's got his rubber magic tongue.  You've got your rubber magic tongue?  Where in the bathroom do you keep it?  In a toolbox by the tub.  In a toolbox by the tub.  In a toolbox by the tub.  In a toolbox by the tub.  That's great.  That's funny.  All right, Fred.  If I had a hammer, I'd cram it up my ass in the tub.  All right, Fred. 
[03:04:00]  Now, Fred, where do you usually do this?  In the bathtub, or where do you go?  Fred?  The magic glasses, for God's sake.  What?  Speak up, lad.  Speak up.  Speak up?  Oh, speak up.  Fred.  Fred.  Yeah.  Take it.  Let me hear what it sounds like.  Knock it on the mouthpiece of your phone.  That's the rubber magic tongue.  I think he hit himself. 
[03:04:30]  Hold on.  I think he hit himself in the head.  In the background, you heard.  Oh.  Like it bounced back and nailed him.  Ouch.  All right, Fred.  Now, when you make love to this thing, do you do it on your bed?  No.  Where do you do it?  In the bathtub.  In the bathtub, because why?  The KY makes a mess?  Yeah.  Good boy.  All right, Fred.  Well, jump in the bathtub. 
[03:05:00]  No.  Why?  Why, man?  Well, why?  Because it takes you long.  What are you doing all day?  We have a half hour left in the show.  This is called The Showstopper.  Fred, this is going to get you girls.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And this is also going to get you back being very famous on the Opian Anthony program.  Oh, really?  And we don't...  Yeah, we don't want the whole sex act.  We don't want the moaning. 
[03:05:30]  We just want to kind of show people, you know...  How desperate you are.  And that will make girls just come out and want to have sex with you.  And how sad your life is.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  All right.  Start taking your pants off.  Well, I'm sorry.  Fred.  Yes, you are.  Yeah.  Fred.  Can I tell you something, Fred?  Uh-oh.  The thread.  Are you pulling the thread out?  Are you there?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Fred, you sure you don't want to do this?  Maybe I'll call you seven times in the tub. 
[03:06:00]  Fred.  Fred.  If you want to be part of the Opian Anthony program.  I wish you got your life.  This is ridiculous.  Fred.  Fred.  What Opie's trying to say is, you know, you're pretty much in a position now where you have  to do this.  You want the fame, the notoriety.  You want us to hook you up with girls.  You're going to have to get in that tub and shove that dildo up your ass.  Oh, really? 
[03:06:30]  Really, Fred.  What the hell are you on my way?  Yeah, Fred, because if you don't do it, I hate it.  I've got no class.  I've got no class.  If you don't do it, you're off the show.  Yeah, if you don't do it, I hate to admit, but after nine years of having you on and off  our radio program, this would be your last appearance.  And no girls.  When was it?  Back in 85, right?  Yeah, that was nine years ago. 
[03:07:00]  It was 90, I think we met you around 96 there.  95, you're right.  Oh.  All right, what are you doing, Fred?  What are you doing, Fred?  Walk us through it, Fred.  Well, roll us through it.  I've got him in the tub now.  You're in the tub.  I'll go away for a few moments.  What?  He has to wait a few moments or we have to?  I've got to use both arms to pull myself up. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, he's got to use both arms to pull himself up.  Okay, do whatever you need to do.  I'm going to cry.  He'll be back.  All right, he's going to use both arms to pull himself up.  That was really sweet when Ope said, go ahead, take your pants down.  The guy's in a wheelchair for a motorcycle accident.  Take your pants down.  This is horrible.  It's nice.  Take your pants down.  Wow.  Jesus.  All right, we're waiting for Fred.  He said it would be a moment. 
[03:08:00]  It takes him a while.  Ben Bailey in studio, by the way.  How did he get back out of the tub with two arms with a K-Y all over, though?  Like, that would be all slippery to get out of the tub.  It's like a skating rink.  You rang.  You rang.  All right, very funny.  All right, so, Fred, what's going on?  I've got my dong and my hand and my butt exposed.  All right, you've got the dong and your hand and your butt exposed.  All right, you've got the K-Y, Fred. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  All right, lube that thing up.  What?  Lube it up, Fred.  Lube it on up there, Fred.  Spread it around.  Don't be shy.  Oh, man.  All right.  Let us know what you're doing, Fred.  I've got the lube to target. 
[03:09:00]  What?  Huh?  It's all lubed up.  It's all lubed up.  All right, Fred.  Well, you know what to do with it now, so go ahead.  Explain what you're doing, Fred.  I'll just take your ex-wife off after me.  What did he say?  I can't hear him.  I'll just take your ex-wife.  Oh, you're going to think of my ex-wife?  What a coincidence.  What a coincidence.  She stuck one up my ass, too, Fred, so... 
[03:09:30]  Oh, really?  Well, we got it up my butt now.  You got it up there, Fred?  Yeah.  How does that feel?  What's going on?  How?  It's just a thing ever been meant.  He has...  His voice changed.  His voice changed.  His voice changed.  Your voice got higher, Fred.  What happened?  I'm going to hide it now.  His voice got higher.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, Jesus.  This is horrible.  Fred, what's going on?  I'm working at...  How did we end up here?  I'm going to swim, guy.  Oh, my God. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Well, we made a deal with him.  Okay, ladies.  You hear how desperate he is.  Come on aboard.  Yeah.  This could be yours.  Fred, do you imagine anything while you're doing this?  I don't know her name.  Bob?  But I've seen some girls on the Internet that will do this for me.  Oh, you've seen...  Yes.  I wouldn't know how to use the Internet. 
[03:11:00]  He's seen girls on the Internet that will do this for him.  They're called trannies, Fred.  Yeah.  Well, very good.  There you go.  I have a bunch of sex for all.  So, what else is going on, Fred?  This is what Fred has to do to have sex, by the way.  Yeah, this is Fred's only pleasure in life.  Are you pumping it in and out, Fred, of your backside?  Yeah.  I've got my hands with my hands out.  Maybe this would be a good time for you to finish the news. 
[03:11:30]  No.  Yeah, this would be the time where you would do the lighter side of the news.  That wacky little story.  In breaking news, my phallus now has a kidney bean skin on it.  Fred might become part of the wacky news.  He can't get back down the tub, and they find him this way.  Yeah, Fred, how do you get out of the tub with the slippery KY on your hands?  What?  He's not even listening anymore. 
[03:12:00]  I know.  Do you just kind of float out on your tears?  No.  Shame-filled river?  No, I'm quite strong.  He's quite strong.  He does have that crazy strength in his upper body.  That's true.  I have amazing strength in your body.  Yeah.  Don't talk, Fred.  Just push it in and out.  Don't use it.  Fred, are you going to, you know, finish?  Are you whacking your bag, Fred?  Is this good for you? 
[03:12:30]  Fred?  I think it's a yes.  Fred?  I can hardly hear you.  I can't hear you.  Yeah.  Fred, do you, you know, are you going to, you know, finish or what?  Yeah.  Hey, Fred, is there any way to put the phone back there so we can hear it going in and out?  It's all right.  Why?  I'd like to hear that, Hope.  He can't hear us.  I think the ultimate in degradation would just be to hang up on him and leave him there in the top of the tub. 
[03:13:00]  No one is there and no one's to talk to.  We'll do the silent game to him.  Yeah, silent game.  All right.  So, Fred, how's it going in there?  How marvelous.  I'm picking up speed nice and fast.  Make it count.  Oh, mercy, the first good. 
[03:13:30]  I've got enough to lose.  I need a girl from a bitch for me.  Are you there?  Are you guys there?  For God's sake, say something. 
[03:14:00]  You got to learn how they work in the machine.  Oh, brother.  My God, you took it out.  It's all bullshit. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, shit, I say I'm for shit.  Here we go.  So, ladies, come on down and do me.  For God's sake, do me. 
[03:15:00]  Okay, I don't know what I'm going to do later.  I'm going to go now.  I'm going to go wash my ass.  So, I'm going to do the first thing.  Adios.  Bye-bye.  Oh, my God. 
[03:15:30]  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  Anybody else have a hard on?  Hi, this is Jamie Heineman.  And this is Adam Savage.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Endorsed by Mythbusters.  Hey, guys, hope you're enjoying the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Got a bit about Ricky.  We have lots of bits about Ricky, our intern.  At this point, I think we feel very, very sorry for the kid. 
[03:16:00]  Isn't his internship over?  Hopefully.  I like what this says.  Where's Ricky?  Two short segments trying to figure out where the hell Ricky is and why it's taking him so long to get food and coffee.  Like, this could be any day that Ricky's in.  It's just an ongoing thing with the kid.  It's just amazing.  It's amazing.  His stupidity just amazes all of us.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Does anybody know where the fuck Ricky is?  What happened?  Oh, my goodness.  What's wrong?  Oh, boy.  He sent...  I sent him for a coffee before the show started. 
[03:16:30]  It was before the show started.  Where the hell is he?  For a medium coffee with a little bit of milk.  Well, he's not buying it from those savages.  What?  He hasn't come back yet.  He hasn't come back?  I hope he's all right.  See, I'm thinking maybe he had a problem down in the streets of New York.  The tough streets.  I'm thinking that's the only acceptable answer.  Maybe he'd be better.  Because if I look outside and I see the cherries spinning on an ambulance and they're loading that little incompetent into the back.  Where's Ricky? 
[03:17:00]  He got lost.  No, he didn't.  What?  I'm not kidding.  We sent him to the new place for food and I don't think he found his way back.  Oh, I sent him for started around the corner.  I know.  He didn't know where he was going.  How do you get lost in Manhattan at this hour?  This is Ricky.  It's a grid.  Maybe he got in the middle of some intern wars.  Oh, really?  Maybe there's some pop-pop going on.  There's been some gunfire outside our studios like Hot 97?  Yes, Nathaniel.  Well, I just got Jim's delicious, hopefully, banana at the place Ricky's supposed to be at. 
[03:17:30]  No sign of him.  Oh, my God.  He's probably just wandering around Central Park trying to find his way back here.  He's a little slow.  Nate G is going to slink some land into him when he gets back here, I bet.  He's going to have some gunfire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, well.  Lost?  Does he have a cell phone or anything?  Of course not.  He doesn't know how to answer it.  He's a little slow.  A little slow.  Nice kid.  A little slow.  You know how the streets work in Manhattan?  They're numbered.  They go up and down. 
[03:18:00]  It's pretty easy.  If you're on 56th and you have to get to 57th, you pretty much know where you've got to go.  He's been gone a half hour and all he had to do was cross the street.  All I wanted was coffee.  This is why the rule is, no, he can't touch my food because this stuff happens all the time.  All I wanted was coffee.  All the time, Jimmy.  All the time with him.  How's your banana?  Is it too hard?  Well, Nathaniel got it.  No.  It's a perfect banana.  I haven't caught Nathaniel testing it before.  He was kind of slapping on his cheek and he said, that's the right consistency. 
[03:18:30]  He's a good boy.  That kid's a go-getter, I'll tell you.  He certainly is.  And Stan knows how to make another man happy and I like him.  Ricky.  Yes.  What's going on?  Nothing much.  I'm lost.  What do you mean you're lost?  Dude, I would have told me to make a left out the building and then make a left at the corner.  Yeah.  I'm going down two blocks and then the deli going two blocks down.  Right.  Did he happen to mention the Starbucks that you were supposed to go to for me at quarter to six? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  I was going to go to the Starbucks last just to keep your coffee fresh because I was going to go there first and then wait at the deli, you know?  So where are you now?  I'm still on six.  Forget the Starbucks.  I'm going to have somebody else go.  Now, wait.  Eric, is he near where he's got to be?  Ricky, you're on sixth and what?  And I was down on 58.  He's right there.  I was supposed to go north instead of south.  He told me he left.  Here's what you got to do. 
[03:19:30]  Walk into the middle of the street, face away from traffic and put your hands over your ears.  Wait, what?  Wait, he's right around the corner?  He's right around the corner.  And he's lost?  It's across the street from where he's standing.  And now, you haven't been to the deli yet?  No, I haven't seen the deli.  All right.  It's a blue awning, you said, right?  Yeah, it's right there.  Wait, you've been gone a half hour and you're only, like, right around the corner. 
[03:20:00]  Oh.  I don't see.  I see the Manhattan Ocean Club.  Manhattan Ocean Club, Eric?  I don't know where that is.  It's across from Jekyll and Hyde.  Jekyll and Hyde.  Go across the street and then up a little bit.  It's right there.  Have you seen Jekyll and Hyde's, the theme restaurant?  Yeah.  Are you in front of Jekyll and Hyde's?  No.  It's here from turning around.  Go back to Jekyll and Hyde's.  Sex Bagel's running out to find the intern and bring him back home. 
[03:20:30]  If you knew, if anyone that doesn't know Manhattan knew how close he was to us right now, he is right around a corner.  Yeah.  You're right around the corner from us.  It's been a half hour.  Longer.  What are you doing?  Just walking around aimlessly?  Yeah, basically.  I thought, I made the left down to the block and then I thought, okay, maybe I was supposed to leave at the right of the building.  It's the left of the building.  So then I went back up and I didn't see the deli down there anyway. 
[03:21:00]  The weird part is there's a deli on every corner.  Yeah, but I was told to go to a certain one.  All right.  Yes, Ben?  You hired this guy.  I know.  All right, Ricky.  We're coming to get you.  I have nothing to say.  Are you going to rescue him?  Yeah, we're going to rescue Ricky the intern.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's fucking stupid.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  XM 202, The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know, I was just thinking the other day, Anthony, that we haven't done a live broadcast in a while. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, good.  I think we're ready.  No, I think we're ready for another one.  I'm done with them.  You don't want to do any?  I shan't be doing any more live broadcasts.  Why?  You have a memory like an ant.  Oh, no.  What's wrong with doing live broadcasts in front of the fans?  I like being live in front of the fans.  Broadcasting, though, I've had it.  It's trying to do our job in the midst of animals.  Just animals.  Savages.  Remember how difficult it was to do a show? 
[03:22:00]  I love that, though.  Yeah.  Just trying to, you know, make it up on the fly.  And because of that, we get some good audio.  Yeah, I know that.  Remember the chick from Sexits?  Sexits?  What happened to them?  They were supposed to be a sponsor on our show.  They were supposed to be a sponsor, and then...  I remember what happened at the Hard Rock Cafe, and I thought they told us off mic that they  really enjoyed it.  They loved it.  They told me that that girl would give me head, but I had to get on a plane and go to  West Palm Beach.  Yeah? 
[03:22:30]  Really?  Yep.  Did you really want head from her?  More than I wanted to get on a plane and go on to West Palm Beach.  She had back tits and everything.  She was a disaster.  I have front tits.  We would have been perfect together.  We would have hugged and mushed each other.  Well, she got in front of our rowdy crowd and decided that she could control the crowd,  and it just got ugly.  Sometimes I really love our audiences.  Oh, yeah.  We just...  Because they're nice to us.  Yeah.  They're very loving with us, but boy, if you're a fucking middle-aged chick trying to tell  a story and control them, you are dead. 
[03:23:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, Kenny's trying to get our attention again.  Yeah, you have a new sponsor we've got to talk to.  Ooh.  We have a new sponsor?  Yeah, the sponsors are starting to come back on the show, Anthony.  What is it?  Where's your hot shirt?  All the way in the back.  If you wanted to call for us, she's all the way in the back there, fellas.  Opie, is it General Motors?  Is it Dell Computers?  Jeanette, please make your way over here, please.  Kenny, shut the fuck up! 
[03:23:30]  I think that they were going to park...  Hey, fellas, if you can, just let...  All right, wait, get up.  Get up over.  Now, see, now we're dealing with a bunch of alcoholics.  Now this is going to...  Of course we are.  This is where the show gets really interesting.  We knew that this was what it was going to be generating.  Where is this gal?  I never saw that coming.  I went to Patrick's Day?  No.  Yeah.  Drugs in a bar, doing a broadcast from a bar.  We're just trying to control the festivities.  Nice.  Oh, my God, here we go.  Wow.  Wow.  Good God.  What a lovely gal. 
[03:24:00]  Hi.  No, you can't.  You can't.  You can't get...  No, we don't care.  What is this for?  It's the talking to stupid...  I know.  I can think it's better things to do with it.  Wow.  Yeah.  There you go.  It looks like a big black one, doesn't it?  You want me to hold it?  I'll take care of it.  Okay.  Oh, she's lovely.  All right.  Well, this is going to be the part of the show that goes nowhere. 
[03:24:30]  Well, Opie, it's a new sponsor.  We love our sponsors, but was this the best opportunity to announce a new sponsor?  You hear these animals out there.  That's how drunk they are.  They can't even get show you're out.  They're just cutting to the shape.  That's right.  Tits.  Tits.  Tits.  All right, Kenny, what the hell's going on?  What's her name?  I don't know.  We're going to talk to these people about some kind of sex stuff. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  Opie, hi.  This is Don, and this is Jeanette, and we're here on behalf of Sexits.com.  Sexits.com.  Yes, sir.  Sexits.com.  And what is this about?  Sexits.com is an online personals website that provides its members with a discreet way  to hook up to hook up while traveling our nation's highways.  That sounded very off the cuff.  Okay.  Hello, New York.  I love you.  Happy St. Patrick's Day.  Wow.  I could get this out because no one could hear me. 
[03:25:30]  I would like to tell my story.  She looks like she's 28 from the back.  She looks like she's 52.  I would like to tell my story, please.  Oh, yeah.  I fell asleep in a tub in the shining.  I would like to tell.  Don't worry.  Hold on.  Don't worry.  They will let you talk.  Let me tell you something there, sweetie.  All right.  Try again.  You've got to plow through.  They'll let you talk.  Go ahead.  First of all, I would like to say to you. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, you've just got to plow through.  I am the Canal Street Madam, and I've got something to say.  She's a madam.  Wow, madam.  You're a madam?  I like that.  She's in control of her destiny.  Now, can I have your attention, please?  No.  Now that I've got your attention, my name is Jeanette Meyer.  Please let me talk.  This is very important. 
[03:26:30]  My name is Jeanette Meyer.  I've been on four.  All right.  You guys.  You guys.  All right.  Go ahead.  40 fucking times.  If you shut up, I will.  How about a little respect for the lady, everybody?  How about a little respect for the lady, everybody?  How about a little respect for the lady, everybody?  How about a fucking time, sweetheart? 
[03:27:00]  If everybody hushes and let me tell my story.  All right.  Guys, Jeanette really does want to show her tits.  Who's the radio guy?  God.  But we're not able to.  Hard Rock Cafe says no.  I'm sorry, guys, because of the liquor being sold.  They are so...  You know something?  You know something?  I don't think you understand our audience very well. 
[03:27:30]  I have a story to tell you.  You just have to plow through it.  Okay.  My name is Jeanette Meyer.  Just talking.  You don't have to.  I've been on 48 hours, part time.  I've had a movie.  I am the Canal Street Madam in New Orleans.  What was the movie?  I was involved with the National Circuit bussed by the FBI.  The Pussy Posse. 
[03:28:00]  Okay?  Hey, Jim.  Jim.  Wasn't she in Last House on the Left?  You just got to plow through it.  I knew I should have worn my nines outfit.  Great.  Okay.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  All right.  Please let me speak.  Please.  I have so much respect for New York and the people here.  All right.  Sexits.com.  What do you want to say, Jeanette?  You're right.  They're starting a challenge.  What are they fucking times, sweetheart? 
[03:28:30]  She's got a point she's trying to make there, people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was a part of the international sex circuit that was busted in 2008.  That's the one during 9-11.  Huh?  Wait a minute.  What?  What?  If you don't go down there and buy some pussy, then the terrorists win.  Do you all want to hear sex stories or not?  Do you all want to hear about politicians getting their dicks sucked? 
[03:29:00]  How do you lose with that?  Do you all want to know where your taxpayer money's going?  Do you guys want to see tits?  Show us the clam.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's hear it for our new sponsor.  Timmy, show your tits.  Sexits.com.  Sexits.  That's right.  And now, what will people get when they go to sexits.com? 
[03:29:30]  What are they going to, what do they expect?  Well, we're the highway.  I'm now the spokesperson for the sexits.com in which we connect people throughout the country.  You connect people.  Together.  So, you go to the website if you're looking for a chick.  Well, I went from madam to being a sex person because I need something to do with my mouth these days.  Oh.  Are you really on the site, though?  Are you one of the chicks they can meet on the site?  Huh? 
[03:30:00]  Are you really on the site?  No, people can hook up.  Do you have a term trick for old times?  Oh, yeah.  You can go to Google to find out the story about the FBI, how they use the taxpayers' money.  During 9-11, well.  You're losing them again.  You're losing them again.  Well, you know what, though?  Hold on.  I've got to explain what was going on.  She's bending over to talk to us.  Yeah.  And everyone just took turns with their digital cameras, getting a shot of her jumper.  Guys, the producer asked that we bring Jeanette off the stage.  What?  Oh, what happened?  Wait, what happened?  Ben Sparks asked that she... 
[03:30:30]  Why?  I thought she had like a...  Why is Ben Sparks telling...  Ben, Ben, we need advice.  Fuck Ben Sparks.  Fuck Ben Sparks.  Fuck Ben Sparks.  Fuck Ben Sparks.  Fuck Ben Sparks.  Come on, Elo, chime in.  Oh, yeah, she's trying to get her info out.  Yeah, I think she's got a real blazing story here.  Politicians actually use prostitutes.  I have no idea.  Yeah, you got a good politician story? 
[03:31:00]  You got a good politician story?  Give her the microphone.  Okay, I hope he can.  You got a good politician story?  Can you bend over more?  Yes, I do, actually.  They're trying to get shots of your...  I just want to tell you guys...  You got to plow through, sweetheart.  You just got to...  I am now the spokesperson for Texas.com.  Just see the end of the story and just start walking towards it.  Every sentence is another step.  I'm 46, baby, but I still got it. 
[03:31:30]  Anyway, we have a new internet called Texas.com.  I'm now the spokesperson for.  She keeps just saying once upon a time.  Yeah, once upon a time, right.  I'm wearing hands up for next time.  I have stories to tell you guys.  All right, why don't we give the...  Wait, why don't we give the microphone to the brains of the operation?  All right, sir.  Would you like to grab the microphone?  Well, keep spending your money.  Wait, I want to hear what Roseanne Barvois has to say.  Well, they wear Dom Perignon tied to them.  Yeah.  Very nice. 
[03:32:00]  All right, very nice.  I think you're lovely.  Kenny just assaulted her for the microphone.  It's sexits, S-E-X-I-T-S.com.  Go ahead.  Sir, maybe you could do a better job at telling people what's sexits.com.  Yeah, you guys...  Run around, tell them our new sponsor.  Yeah, listen to what this guy has to say, okay?  Yeah.  Get in the middle of the stage.  They'll listen to it, guys.  All right, guys.  All right, thank you.  I appreciate it.  You just got to plow through, sir.  As stated before, just want to see the end of the story.  Let me make it here.  Hold on, guys. 
[03:32:30]  This is how we treat our new sponsors.  You've got to love this.  Just don't hear that.  Just don't hear the fuck you.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  Oh, my...  Jesus.  Go.  All right, listen, listen, listen.  Just plow ahead.  And that will be available outside the building after the show.  How's that sound?  Would that work for you?  And she'll be happy to talk with you.  Don't ask questions, man.  Just tell them what sexits is all about.  All right, your sexits.com is an online personal website. 
[03:33:00]  Louder!  Sir, just plant your feet.  And plow a head.  Sir, you just have to go through it.  Let them know what they're going to get.  It provides its members with a discreet way to hook up while traveling our nation's highways.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  By being able to plot your recourse while driving the interstate.  Wait, I have a question.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Is sexits.com a porn site? 
[03:33:30]  Is it a porn site?  I love New York.  Is sexits.com a porn site?  No, but sexits.com is not a porn site.  In fact, it's an online personal's website.  Hey, what's the name of the website again?  Sexits.com.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  I haven't heard that.  But do they allow adult content?  No, but it does.  It allows adult content.  Users must be 18 years old until they're older.  All right.  Get them off the stage, Kenny.  Kenny, get them off the stage.  Kenny. 
[03:34:00]  Wrap it up.  Kenny.  Just put a button on the story.  Wrap it up.  Get them off the stage.  It's a personal introduction service is what it is.  Yes.  You want to hook up with a girl.  A girl wants to hook up with you.  Through sexits, you can then hook up with chicks.  And, you know, who knows what's going to happen once you meet them.  Things like that.  All kinds of stuff can happen.  Go to sexits yourself and check it out and see if it'll work for you. 
[03:34:30]  There you go.  Wow.  And can I say...  Our audience is brutal.  I was supposed to have some interaction with that lovely young lady, and you guys all  cock-blocked.  Thanks a lot.  And he means that.  Thank you.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Ricky's back in studio.  Why is he just standing here?  Because he got lost going to the microphone.  You all right, Rick?  No, I just once again screwed up.  Oh.  Feeling a little bad about yourself? 
[03:35:00]  You okay?  It's just...  I don't know.  Today I came in, you know, thinking I was going to get everything right.  I had everybody orders down and everything, and then...  Something just keeps happening, doesn't it?  You can't even look at us.  I know.  I'm just too ashamed to look at y'all right now.  Oh, he's too ashamed.  I'm ashamed.  It's not a sexual issue.  It's not like we walked in and caught you blowing Ben.  Again?  Yeah.  Exactly.  We understand you had to get the gig.  It's all forgotten.  Oh, my. 
[03:35:30]  You're not going to cry, are you?  You are really upset about this.  Looks like you might cry, Anthony.  It'll be all right.  Cry.  Cry.  Cry.  Cry.  You going to squirt?  You going to squirt?  Wow.  It's okay, I guess.  Yeah, it's all right.  I got my coffee finally.  Don't worry about it.  Why do you think it happened this time?  You see, instead of just being ashamed, you've got to assess the situation and kind of say,  why did this happen this time?  So you don't make that mistake again.  So assess the situation. 
[03:36:00]  What happened?  I thought the name of the deli was actually the Blue Awning.  The Blue Awning.  Yeah.  So when you saw a deli that had a Blue Awning, but a different name, that confused you.  Yeah.  No, I thought it, yeah.  Yeah.  Are you right now thinking, my God, was that a stupid thing to do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some people in the other room with their heads in their hands.  Poor Rick, I feel bad because a lot of times he's walking around, 
[03:36:30]  and he's probably like, I'm not going to call in.  I'm going to do it this time.  I'm going to find it.  I'm going to make it through.  Yeah.  Did you notice a lot of time was going by and you were probably thinking to yourself,  uh-oh.  Yeah.  They've got to be talking about where I am.  Yeah.  I'm like looking at it and I'm like, oh, crap.  Not bad.  Got a little shaken up inside, a little more nerves,  and kind of threw you for a loop a little more.  You're kind of stupid.  That's not true, Opie.  Jesus, Opie.  He's kind of stupid, though.  No, he isn't.  He is.  There are certain things that happen that put you in situations that perhaps, you know, 
[03:37:00]  it just didn't pick up on right away.  He's not good with directions.  Some people are not good with directions.  Some people aren't.  I mean, it was in the right direction.  It just didn't see the rest of it.  Dude, all he had to do was take one left and then another left.  Yeah.  Left, left.  Trying to stick up for you.  Left, left.  Knock down his argument.  Jesus.  Left, left, and then look for a blue awning.  That was all he had to do.  I would have to say you're a little slow.  Oof.  Jesus.  Just a little.  Let's say that.  It's not accurate.  He's a good guy.  All right, Ricky. 
[03:37:30]  Wow.  Okay.  We look forward to your next mess up, I guess.  Makes for good radio.  He shouldn't.  Well.  There he goes.  If I was somebody right now, I would open a place up called the Blue Awning.  That's right.  You know, so that way if anyone else gets confused, you get their overflow business.  I don't want to say I'm dejected.  Sorry.  Too late.  That is one upset individual.  He is really, really down on himself about that screw-up. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  Because we have such a group of go-getters that can just, like, they're Johnny on the spots.  You know?  You give them a little mission, they do it.  It's not a problem.  And he's had a couple of problems.  This isn't the first time this has happened.  This goes back to childhood and the times where, like, he would just be kind of sitting there  in the woods by himself, like, kind of like Henry Fonda in on Golden Pond, when he went  to pick strawberries or blueberries.  Looking at the loom.  I got lost. 
[03:38:30]  Poor old codger.  The dopey old man hat with his fishing hat.  He can't even get a rod to molest the blonde boy that's been spending the summer with him.  He takes him out on the old boat.  Oh, my goodness.  That's another one of those movies that just makes me laugh really hard when I see it.  When he starts looking around and he realizes he's lost.  Up at the trees, they're so tall and scary.  That's so confusing.  That must have been when it looked like blue awnings and buildings spinning around. 
[03:39:00]  I thought it was the blue awning.  I was lost.  Hi, Brian Kilmeade, sports guy, also co-host of Fox and Friends in the Morning on You Guest  at the Fox News Channel.
