<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony (with Rich Voss filling in for Jim Norton), jokingly billing themselves as "radio shock jocks" and immediately launching into explicit commentary on a Discovery HD segment featuring topless African women.  This transitioned into a discussion of *Dancing with the Stars*, specifically Helio Castroneves, and speculation about his marital status, followed by a brief, similarly explicit discussion of *Girls Next Door*.  Listener calls followed, including one unsuccessful attempt to wake a nude spouse with a loud horn, and a discussion of Marie Osmond's potentially scripted lines on *Dancing with the Stars*, prompting commentary on TMZ.

The show then shifted to LeBron James's Yankees hat at an Indians game, sparking a conversation about sports allegiances and personal beliefs, which segued into a discussion of Donny Osmond's abstinence and the hosts’ own religious (or non-religious) views. Opie declared himself a "religious free agent,"  using vulgar language while humorously discussing various religions, including anecdotes about his father’s tax evasion attempts by falsely claiming their family was a church.  More listener calls and banter about yarmulkes and religious ceremonies ensued, with several names added to their "weirdo list."

The next segment focused on childhood guilt instilled by parents using God as a threat, leading to humorous suggestions for alternative "Gods of your choice" within a 12-step program (He-Man, Captain Morgan).  Studio guest Sam joined the discussion, initially about commercialized yarmulkes, which quickly devolved into a racially charged exchange, with the hosts repeatedly joking about Sam being a "white black guy" and proposing photoshopping his picture.  This led to a discussion of Ric Flair's endorsement of Mike Huckabee, with satirical commentary on audio clips.  Further calls included Jessica discussing yarmulke designs, sparking a debate on which religious figures would "win" in a hypothetical fight, followed by Sarah detailing her experience with the Satanic Bible, leading to a discussion of their perception of Satanism. Additional calls covered sports team loyalties and a caller's girlfriend’s nude Wiccan-like commune.  Opie discussed his potential return to marijuana use, reminiscing about past drug use.  A "Presidential Hackery" segment mocked presidential actions, followed by a return to the "white black guy" joke about Sam. A caller's negative Gospel Brunch experience prompted Anthony to share unpleasant memories of attending such events with his ex-wife and mother-in-law, leading to a lengthy anecdote about his stressful former relationship and his ex-mother-in-law's driving.  The segment concluded with Opie recounting his father's extreme gun ownership and an incident where his father nearly shot him. A final caller, Annie, discussed her online dating experiences, including an encounter with a 70-year-old married man.

Another segment began with Annie, a caller detailing her AOL Instant Messenger investigation of a date who turned out to be active in gay chat rooms.  This was followed by more "Presidential Hackery," listener calls sharing embarrassing stories, and a lengthy discussion of the Coen Brothers' *Fargo*.  Rich Vos called in to promote his stand-up.

A subsequent segment featured a series of listener calls detailing embarrassing and disgusting personal anecdotes (accidental spitting, mistaken loogies, discovering one’s brother with one’s girlfriend, etc.).  A significant portion focused on the creation and debut of "AJ Poop" (AJ Poopy Shits), a new recurring character with an effeminate voice and an obsessive love for women's breasts. A pre-recorded promo and a live in-studio interview with the character followed, filled with sexually explicit details.  The hosts and other on-air personalities reacted with amusement and disgust.  Discussion also included a frustrating attempt to navigate a cheesy ballad playlist with an un-numbered song list and a news story about three men dressed as women attacking McDonald's employees.

The final segment opened with discussion of a host falling asleep during the show, referencing an earlier “tit thing.”  This was followed by discussion of AJ Poopy Shits,  the "line of the day" segment, and a contentious phone call with Eric Logan, a seemingly important figure connected to the show, resulting in insults and Logan hanging up before being called back multiple times.  A planned show merger was also mentioned. The show concluded with a bizarre, sexually suggestive prank call or staged interaction with someone impersonating AJ Poopy Shits before an abrupt ending with mentions of upcoming programming.  Throughout the broadcast, crude language and sexually explicit innuendo were pervasive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock 노ants, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony striking again.  I sat with some of the greatest dancers in the world.  John Gotti, and I went in there and said, John, you ever f*** with me again.  This is Opie. You hear her? Now sit on him.  Opie and Anthony.  I was amazed Guns N' Roses was starting to blow up  and you didn't have guitars to play 
[00:01:00]  because you were pointing them off to get some dope.  Yeah, I was a big fan of your age.  Big fan.  Opie and Anthony.  This country went off the cliff and it's just in free fall news.  It's just a sick, sick, it's disgusting my voice you hear.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I think they know that.  Do you say what's up, bitches? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  You're about to listen to a wicked cool radio show.  What do you do?  Wicked cool.  What do you do?  What do you do?  You just say, hey.  Hey.  Good morning.  That's what I say.  I like the good morning thing.  How about we start with?  Wake the F up.  Wake up.  That's a good one.  Oh, people's alarms just went on.  Ah.  Oh, African boobies.  This was a turn on.  Showing them.  This was a turn on when I was a kid for some reason. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  What news show is doing this story?  Oh, no.  It's Discovery HD.  Well, how did that end up on that?  Oh, my God.  God bless Discovery HD.  Screw the news this morning.  I want to see African boobies all morning.  They're just showing women making mud huts in Nambia.  Digging out like bugs with sticks.  With their boobies out.  With their topless. 
[00:03:00]  That was my thing when I was growing up.  I don't know why it was my thing.  I think because we got National Geographic at all.  Yeah, that was the biggie.  That has to be the reason.  So, it didn't matter that it was African saggy boobies.  No.  The fact that it was naked boobies.  It was just any boobies were really good.  You know what the best was, though?  And it was very rare, but you sometimes got it.  When they did things on Tahiti in National Geographic.  Why Tahiti?  Because Tahitian women had really nice breasts. 
[00:03:30]  And they were, you know, because they were perky.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, so they were more like the ones you wanted to see.  When they would go into like...  They looked like maracas.  Yeah.  When they would show the Bushmen of the Kalahari and show the women, it wasn't quite as good.  Well, look at the ones that are on TV now.  Oh, my dear Lord.  Look how tall he is.  Who gives a crap about the guy, Rich? 
[00:04:00]  We're talking about African boobies.  And you go, look how tall the guy is.  Rich Voss in for the vacationing Jim Norton.  Yeah, so...  Jimmy's busy.  Wow.  He'll be back tomorrow, I think.  We haven't heard from Jimmy.  Is he going to be back tomorrow?  Because now there's rumors about Jimmy.  Where's Jimmy?  Where has he been?  Oh, look at that.  Oh, no.  It looks like they have a dehydration problem in that country.  Yeah.  Wow.  What happens?  He's on Atkins. 
[00:04:30]  I don't care about the guy.  He's on Atkins.  That's funny.  That is pretty funny, though.  Oh, my God.  Look, wait.  That one girl has to be, like, 13.  And she's already starting to have gravity take its toll.  Why are they orange?  They paint themselves up.  Oh, do they?  Yeah.  And that's the mother?  Doesn't she play tennis?  No.  No.  No. 
[00:05:00]  They're trying to marry off.  We will give her family two sheep.  Two sheep.  And later, a cow.  For what?  What do they get?  For the bride.  For her?  Yeah.  Or for the cow will be payment for any children born to her.  They will be ours.  And then they take them.  Boy.  Hold out for two.  You know something?  Hey, that's a pretty good deal.  Look at her.  How about working on the wheel?  Look at her, though, man.  And what's up with the hair? 
[00:05:30]  I own that womb.  I said, if it's a girl, she's mine.  This is the mother talking.  Yeah.  We usually engage women at a very young age.  Wow.  So very good.  I'm amazed that you're able to read.  Pan that camera down.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that.  Dude, she's packing, though.  She's ample.  Let's just put it this way.  That gravity's a bitch, because you've got the mother and you've got the young daughter.  And the young daughter, you get to see everything. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  In the same shot, you don't get to see everything with the...  No, she was out of frame.  Right.  They went out of the bottom of the frame of the television.  God.  You've got to love Discovery HD.  Make sure this is on every morning.  It is a good one.  Well, as long as they're doing things on Africa.  Sure.  I can't tell if he's a Crip or a Blood.  He's in Nambia.  Yeah.  I don't think they have Bloods and Crips there.  Well, that's how we start the show.  Yeah.  Naked African boobies. 
[00:06:30]  Well, it is Whip-A-Mount Wednesday, so it's perfect.  Hey!  What a tie-in.  I don't need your white girl boobs.  I got African boobs on TV today.  Yeah.  Now I can't turn away.  I want to see her.  You pal-talk girls with your ugly...  Uggy.  Uggy.  Your ugly white boobs.  Uggy.  Keep them covered.  We have black African boobs on TV.  Actually...  Orange.  They are orange.  I don't know why. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at that guy's getting...  That little fella's getting a little beverage.  There's a little fella, a little baby, who's getting a little...  He's getting a little drink.  He's getting a little drink, yeah.  Oh, my God.  His head's on the ground to get a drink, too.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  This is just terrific.  There's just something going on.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  What's he doing with the youngster? 
[00:07:30]  What do you mean?  Is he painting her up?  Look, he's touching her.  Because he was, like, rubbing her belly or something and talking about how she can't  touch a brown cow.  Did she get hit by a softball during the softball game?  Her, uh...  Looks like she took one right in the mouth.  She's a little swollen.  Her lips are a little swollen.  I think.  God, this HD Discovery.  Yeah, that's some channel.  I think we do, like, live reads for Discovery.  Well, there you go.  Do we?  Oh, boy.  No good could come of this.  Are they going to hack this cow's head off? 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  Some kind of ceremony?  I don't know.  The best part is we live in the same world.  This isn't, like...  This is not another planet?  Wait a minute.  I thought this was another planet.  This isn't another planet.  This isn't footage from, like, 40, 50 years ago.  This was probably taped a month ago.  Do you know, uh, we went to the moon?  Yeah.  We went to the moon.  Do you think these people have any clue?  Uh-oh.  Oh, wow.  That can't be good.  They're cutting the cow.  What are they cutting?  What the hell did they just cut off the cow? 
[00:08:30]  They tackled a live cow, and then just, as it's alive, start cutting it up into a...  They just cut the leg off.  It was completely alive, and they just start hacking its legs off.  This isn't fun anymore.  What happened to the boobies?  Bring back the boobies.  There is a whole other world out there.  You think they got cell phones?  Uh, yeah.  You think they're rooting for the Pats to go undefeated this year? 
[00:09:00]  Of course.  Who isn't?  Look at that cow.  Man for a while just walked out of the cow.  Now they're into the intestinal bag.  They're poking...  Oh, that's got to smell great.  They just poked the intestinal sack.  Oh, my God.  That's the...  This is how they tell the weather.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's like...  Because they seem to be...  And tell that silly bastard to stand up straight.  Why is he all crouched over with a stick? 
[00:09:30]  He's hunched over.  He's hunched over pretty good.  I don't think they have a doctor he can go to for osteoporosis.  It looks like a Salvador Dali picture.  Someone who owns black oxen will die.  And he was able to tell this by reading the intestines of the one that they just killed.  Wow.  You must go to Pancot Palace.  That's who he looks like.  Oh, man.  Look at Huggy Bear's career.  All right.  Well, someone let us know when the boobies are back.  Yeah.  I don't... 
[00:10:00]  Oh, well, they're back.  Hello, boobies!  There's a woman carrying a bunch of stuff on her head.  And, wow.  You got to give him the good posture.  Down to her belt line.  Yeah, but the posture is terrific.  That actually helps gravity.  If you saw in that car, Angela Jolie just slept with her baby.  Angela Jolie.  Angela Jolie?  Oh, my God.  This woman's sitting and stirring something in a pot, and she better be careful lest her bosom end up in the pot.  What happens? 
[00:10:30]  And why so quickly?  Because they don't have the brassiere.  Yeah, but if that one girl was 13, had to be.  She was fine.  No, they were already starting to point toward the ground.  She had to be more than 13.  I don't think so.  Well, they don't have bras in that country.  Yeah, I know.  But by 13, if there's a girl that doesn't wear a bra in this country at 13, it's still going to be pretty, you know, perky.  First of all, wow. 
[00:11:00]  Look at this.  They just instantly.  Oh, wow.  There's a brigade of them.  Look at them.  Just wandering around topless.  You think it's a turn on for the men?  No, not at all.  Just because they're not.  They're just wide open.  Yeah, they don't care.  I don't think they care.  I don't think they care about bosoms.  Look at that one.  Oh, my God.  That looked like the nose cone of a rocket.  That looks like a Gemini capsule.  Now they're crawling around on all fours and leaving handprints and two ruts in the sand. 
[00:11:30]  What is...  And we live in the same world, right?  Apparently.  Now they're eating something that looks like duty.  Does this make...  Blow on it, but don't eat it.  They're telling the girl.  I think she's going to get married.  Oh, she's getting married?  Yeah, I think they're marrying her off to this dude.  This gangster-looking guy.  This guy?  No, no. 
[00:12:00]  The gangster-looking guy.  Oh, okay.  That's the old guy.  I think he's like a father.  Oh, now they're all clapping.  Wow, that one doesn't have...  Oh, my God.  The size variance between the two is pretty amazing.  Ridiculous.  As flat as papyrus.  Oh, keep panning down.  Pan down.  Oh, you pan that camera.  That camera's got to pan a lot lower.  Oh, you pan that camera down.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow, I saw two sets of things in that shot.  What's she doing?  Feet and boobs.  Oh, my God. 
[00:12:30]  That looks like...  Now they're doing some kind of booby dance.  Kind of wacky dance.  Let's call it the booby dance.  We might as well.  Oh, okay.  Well, back to the huts at night, but...  Wow.  Okay, that was fun.  That's a great way to start the Opie and Anthony show.  It certainly is.  You're crazy.  Look, there's nothing wrong with her.  Well, she doesn't seem happy, though.  No, she seems very sad.  She hasn't cracked a smile once. 
[00:13:00]  How happy would you be without electricity and running water?  She is miserable.  They don't know any better.  They don't know any better.  Hey, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  Our phone number is 877-212-O-N-A.  You got O-N-A-Radio.com with the show Rundowns.  You got the PowTalk cameras.  And we're feeding the Discovery HD channel right now for everybody.  Yeah.  Is that legal?  Ah, screw it.  Who knows?  And there you go.  That's how we begin the festivities today. 
[00:13:30]  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I know you want to swap things around, like, with days so that people don't get things figured out.  How about Jim Norton's out in LA interviewing with Adam Carolla or negotiating a new contract?  Really?  Yeah, that's actually what's happening.  So, you actually nailed it.  All right. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you, Brooklyn Ace.  Hey, Dance with the Stars.  Yeah.  It's over.  Care?  I don't know.  I guess it gets really big ratings for some reason.  Yeah.  I don't know who's watching a dancing show.  Who's watching that?  We just did right there.  Well, that's different times.  If they put that on, I would watch all the time.  Absolutely.  We're just a messed up society, though. 
[00:14:30]  Why is that, like, completely acceptable to show, like, African women completely naked?  Not completely, but topless.  Yeah.  Jumping around, cooking and stuff.  But if you show, like, you know, Playboy Playmates on the same channel, even.  Right.  That would be a problem.  That would be a problem.  That would be a big problem.  But for some reason, if it's far away and it doesn't seem like our planet, then you can show boobs.  If it looks like the topless women are on Mars, it's okay. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but when Playmates dance, it doesn't start to rain.  Yeah.  Speaking of Playboy Playmates, anybody watch Girl Next Door?  No, that's the one with Hugh Hefner, yeah.  And his girlfriends?  Mm-hmm.  They're getting away with murder.  What channel is that on?  E?  A and E?  Again, another one of those shows I couldn't even tell you.  They just, those girls now walk around completely naked and they pixelate in such a way that if you just squint slightly.  Just a little squint.  If you squint slightly, you see everything.  Like, you see exactly what's going on. 
[00:15:30]  We've learned about the squinting on the pixelation.  That's all it takes.  You squint, you see it better.  Take it from us.  Watch Girls Next Door and when they're pixelated and walking around nude, jumping in and out of hot tubs and pools and stuff, just squint ever so slightly.  You'll see everything.  Yeah.  Everything.  Like, it's not pixelated.  Anyway, for the people who care, here's the end of Dancing with the Stars.  After 10 weeks of competition, the winners and new champions of Dancing with the Stars are... 
[00:16:00]  The big delay.  Elio and...  Ho.  Uh.  Ho.  Um.  Ho.  Elio.  Elio.  Who's Elio?  Ho.  Uh, Than.  Elio.  Did somebody watch this show?  No, no, no.  I could care less.  Oh, my God, could I care less.  We pride ourselves in knowing a little bit about pop culture. 
[00:16:30]  Actually, a lot about pop culture.  I could...  Who the hell is...  The dancing show, you know something, American Idol, something, especially the first few seasons, you watch and go, wow, that's really something.  Okay, singing, whatever.  This dancing thing?  No.  No.  No.  I consider myself a guy.  Hey, I don't care about dancing.  I think that's it.  It is number one pretty much every week.  Why?  Who's watching it?  Women, I think, because the last four winners have all been men. 
[00:17:00]  I just read that this morning.  Oh, right.  And sports figures.  I heard that on wins this morning.  He's a race car driver.  Yes.  And he knows how to dance.  Yes, and his quote was, right after he won, he said, I hope Mel B can hook me up with Spice  Girl tickets.  That's what they win, their trip back to obscurity.  He's a race car driver, and he's looking for Spice Girl tickets?  Make your own joke.  Wait a minute, that doesn't... 
[00:17:30]  Make your own joke at home, people.  Is he...  Is he married?  Married man, are you?  Grady?  Just trying to figure this out.  Does he turn on the TV on Sundays to watch the big game?  Yeah.  What's he watching?  What does he watch on Sundays?  What does he watch on Sundays?  What does television watching habits?  We got a few questions for this guy.  What are the sponsors on his race car?  Right.  Like Tampax?  What kind of TV does the guy watch? 
[00:18:00]  We know what he listens to.  He likes Spice Girls.  Yeah.  He likes to dance.  He likes to dance.  All right.  Well, good for you.  Good for the show.  Blah, blah, blah.  Is it the Mastengel Chevy?  Is that what he's driving?  When they refuel it, do they just pick up a big douche and pour in the fuel?  Right as I was typing his name into Google, it's funny.  The first, you know how it suggests things?  Uh-huh.  The first two things that come up are wife and married. 
[00:18:30]  So I guess a lot of people are curious.  Oh, a lot of people are kind of curious.  Really?  Hey, is he married?  I think the Google trend today is going to have a question mark.  Yeah.  Helio, is he?  Or isn't he?  Or isn't he?  Google search time.  Wow, we can make that happen today.  Mm.  Yeah.  Just put in Helio, H-E-L-I-O.  Is he or isn't he?  In Google.  That's all we want from you guys today. 
[00:19:00]  Let's see if we can make that number one.  Hey, let's say hi to, no, we don't want that one.  We want this one.  Brian, North Carolina.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you were just talking about how the girls from next door are hot and they're almost  naked.  Yeah.  You got to see some of the way these girls on that Dancing with the Stars dress.  The girl that was with Helio?  Yep.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, but it's dancing.  They're in a dance studio and stuff.  It's dancing.  Dude, how long do you watch these unbelievable girls on Dancing with the Stars? 
[00:19:30]  How long do I watch them?  I mean, the entire time they're dancing.  I mean, it's almost like you're waiting for the thing to ride up and see their butt.  No.  See, you're trying to make it cooler than it is.  Dancing with the Stars, you take a quick peek.  Oh, wow.  That girl looks pretty cool.  She's in shape.  Her legs look unbelievable.  Yeah, the dress might fall off.  All right.  What else is on TV?  That's how long it should take.  Yeah.  Really?  That's how long it should take.  No, you're right.  You're right.  But then, I mean.  You waited for a whole dance number.  Well, yeah.  You can't defend that, Brian. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  You can't defend that.  Go to the internet.  Yeah, I know.  Just go to the internet and you don't have to look at dancing.  You can just look at nudity or whatever you want to look at.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  But I tell you what.  They are smoking hot, these girls.  All right.  You keep justifying it.  Smoking hot.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  All right, buddy.  Take care.  By the way, there's a little controversy as far as Marie Osmond goes in that dumb show.  They're starting to say that she might have scripted her fainting or the line she said 
[00:20:30]  after the fainting.  Really?  Yeah.  One of the greatest shows on TV right now is TMZ, trying to get the guy on our show.  But he says he's a huge fan of our show, but he's too busy right now.  He's trying to make time so he can call us and say hi.  But TMZ is just amazing.  It's a great show.  And they noticed something about Marie Osmond in Dancing with the Stars, that she has a writer  on set.  Because a lot of people are really into Marie Osmond and her cute little line she comes  up with every week.  She's like that cutesy thing, right? 
[00:21:00]  And now they're saying that all that is written for her on the spot.  Scripted.  Yeah, here's the story.  Marie Osmond's got a dirty little secret.  How did you know that?  And it's not that she can't dance.  TMZ spies on the set say Marie constantly keeps a writer just off camera to punch up  her witty and spontaneous sound bites.  No, you don't plan those things.  In fact, sources say that Marie's writer was right there during Marie's famous fainting  spell, feeding her lines, and the whole thing may have been staged. 
[00:21:30]  Of the samba.  We're floor two.  Is Marie...  I'm a little bit country.  ...and a little bit conniving?  Anipulating the hustrings of America to keep her in the competition?  They're really reaching.  I love them, though.  I love TMZ.  A little bit country and a little bit conniving.  I love them, though, because they just know who they are, man.  They just know who they are.  They're just tabloid trash, and they ride it all the way to the bank. 
[00:22:00]  All right, we're just getting started.  Rich Voss in for Jim Norton.  Our phone number, 877-212-ONA.  Lots of phone calls once again today from you guys.  Yes, give us a call.  We love your interaction.  It is Whip'em Out Wednesday.  It's also Morning Zoo Bit of the Day Wednesday.  It's Can't Say That Wednesday.  And it's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Oh!  If anybody wants to wake up a spouse or a roommate in some kind of obnoxious fashion, please.  Yeah, last week we didn't get any.  We didn't get any good ones. 
[00:22:30]  Was last week the train horn that didn't work too well?  That was two weeks ago, right?  That was two weeks ago, and last week we had, what, there was one where there was a lot  of cursing, so no one really heard it.  Whatever.  Whatever.  All right, we'll figure it out after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Like, you just stop and go, look.  Like idiots.  Right.  Like retards.  And they showed some kid drinking something out of some piece of a carved-out log.  I just wanted to yell, God milk?  Yeah, he had it all over his face. 
[00:23:00]  But it didn't look like it was a little...  I don't know.  Maybe it was like goat milk or something.  It was very thick.  And then they were pixelating out the private area of a young boy as some woman did something  down there.  Some type of...  I don't know what they're doing to the poor kid.  What are they doing to him now?  What the hell are they doing to him?  Probably something horrific.  Something horrible.  Some tradition.  And they had to pixelate out that.  Like, they show the boobs and everything, but they pixelate out his private area. 
[00:23:30]  And Than brought up a good point.  Who's the creep that has to do that?  Sit in the production room just pixelating out a young boy's stuff.  Young boy!  Oh, dear.  Yes, it needs a little more pixelation.  Woo!  Oh, dear.  Can I review that tape again?  Perhaps we can bring the pixelation a little further in.  Don't want to destroy the entire picture? 
[00:24:00]  Woo!  Somebody's knocking on the door.  Yeah.  You've been in there six hours.  This should have been a ten-minute job.  Yes, I'm running off copies.  Oh, dear.  Yes?  Dr. Smith, are you done?  Yes.  No, no, no.  I'll be in here quite some time.  I'm pixelating.  Woo!  Dear young boy.  Hey, Dr. Smith.  How long is this going to take?  Hours.  Maybe days.  Oh, dear.  We got to get this on the air, sir.  Shut up, you bubbling boobie. 
[00:24:30]  Unlock the door!  Unlock the door, Dr. Smith.  I'm pixelating young boys.  Oh, dear.  Perhaps this one doesn't need any pixelation at all.  I'll take it home with me.  Woo!  I love doing homework.  Give me young Nambian boys.  Yes.  Well, uh...  Oh, dear. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Jimmy's not here, so I've got to read this for Jimmy.  Bird in Philly writes,  That kid doesn't just like the milk.  He loves it!  Hey, let's say hi to Sean.  Sean, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Sean.  Come on.  Uh, TMZ reported, uh, Marie Osmond's dirty little secret was scripted lines.  Yep. 
[00:25:30]  Uh, did anybody remember the show from the 70s with her and her brother, Donnie?  I was 20 before I realized those two weren't married.  My God, they were sick.  Yeah, there was sort of this incestuous little undertone to that program.  I liked what it said on the, uh, the phone screen there.  He wanted to just say that Marie and Donnie Osmond are weirdos.  Yeah.  Let's start our weirdo list today.  I think the whole family, when you, uh, when you raise them from little kids like that to be in show biz. 
[00:26:00]  Sure.  Uh, that's all they know and all they want to do.  So if, if there's a, a fainting thing or, or, uh, you could hire a writer to punch up your lines for a dancing show, that's what they're going to do.  Cause that's all they know.  Let's start our weirdo.  Marie Osmond, Donnie Osmond, weirdos, weirdos.  You got one.  It's our weirdo list.  On the weirdo.  Anybody.  Yeah.  Anybody you see on TV.  Yeah.  Well, the entire Jackson five, right?  Yeah.  They're going back on tour. 
[00:26:30]  Supposedly next year.  Good luck to you.  Uh, Jim in Boston listening on BCN.  Jim, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, I want to wake up the spouse.  Ooh, you want to wake up your spouse.  What do you got?  Uh, a nice, loud handheld ear horn that I'm going to put right next to her ear.  And she sleeps in the nude.  So she'll jump off out of bed and run around the house naked.  Okay.  Well, Jim, here's the thing.  Don't put it right next to her ear.  No, I'll put it close to her.  No, no, not, not that close.  The trick is put the phone close, very close to her. 
[00:27:00]  It's got to be close to her, not you.  Get all the shades open.  The kids are getting ready to go to school.  So she's going to run around.  You live on the first floor.  Here I go.  I'm going from the back porch.  You ready?  All right.  We're ready, Jim.  All right.  Jim in Boston.  Get away.  Oh, shit.  Uh, yeah.  And scene.  And nothing. 
[00:27:30]  And that guy sucked.  I don't think he was waking up anybody.  That's all.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  No.  And then he panicked and cursed.  Yeah.  So they had to dump out.  Then he hangs up the phone before we got the reaction of his wife.  Because there was no wife, was there?  Of course there wasn't.  The young Nambian boy.  With a new horn.  Yeah.  Let's say, uh, good afternoon to Cleveland.  Kurt.  Hey, how you doing, man?  Uh, you're not making Boston happy today. 
[00:28:00]  King James beat the Celtics last night, huh?  38 points, was it?  LeBron James is an ass.  You don't like LeBron?  Why?  I thought everybody, I thought you had to like LeBron James if you lived in Cleveland.  Yeah.  Until you show up to an Indian playoff game with a Yankee hat on.  Oh, you guys haven't forgotten that one, huh?  I'm probably one of only, you know, 700,000 that feel that way, but oh well, screw them.  Yeah, I don't understand that.  Like, LeBron James said he's been a Yankee fan his entire life.  That's fine, whatever.  But to show up at an Indian's home game for the playoffs with a Yankee hat on, that is a little tough to handle, I think. 
[00:28:30]  Well, that's what happens when you give a boy millions of dollars instead of letting him go to college.  You don't learn how to be real and be a man.  At least when Tom Brady wore his Yankee hat down here in New York, it was, you know, it was off-season.  Yeah.  And he can do no wrong.  Sure.  You guys talking about weirdos and Murphy Osmond and all that stuff?  Right.  I can't remember exactly where I stopped, but I'm going to go try to look it up on YouTube today. 
[00:29:00]  A few years back, I saw an interview with Donny Osmond, and one of the things that he talked about, which I cannot understand,  is he said that never in his life has he given or received oral sex because it's just not something he believes in.  It's not part of his belief system?  Well, whether he believes in it or not, it's happening.  Yeah.  I don't believe in it.  Really?  It's going on. 
[00:29:30]  As far as religion goes, I've decided, last night I decided this, actually.  Oh, revelation.  You're a free agent as far as religion?  Yeah, I'm a free agent.  How do you do that?  Kind of like that whole sports thing we were talking about a few weeks ago, being a free agent.  Why do you have to follow your home team year after year after year when they're not dedicated to you, the fan?  They're always changing their team up every single year, so why can't you as a fan change up your favorite team?  True.  Well, what do they give you to lure you in as a free agent? 
[00:30:00]  Huh?  How does a religion, what are they going to give you to lure you in to become a free agent?  They've got to offer you something.  I was reading Sully's book last night, The Paths We Choose, I believe is the name.  Sully, of course, the lead singer of Godsmack, he sent some books down and autographed them and stuff, and it's a great read, by the way.  We really should get him on the show to talk about his book.  It's pretty amazing.  He had a real rough life, real rough life growing up in Lawrence, and where else was he? 
[00:30:30]  All over the place.  In what way?  And then he moved down to Fayetteville, just running with bad boys on the streets and getting into all sorts of fights.  A bad crowd.  Bad crowd, drugs, alcohol, you name it.  I bet he had that chip on his shoulder that guys of his stature have, probably.  Well, he's not the tallest guy.  Well, he knows how to fight, though.  Well, that's just it.  And a lot of fighting stories in this book.  Yeah.  And a lot of bad relationships, you know, going out with a stripper from one of those, I think it was the Golden Banana. 
[00:31:00]  Remember the Golden Banana?  Of course.  Who could forget?  But I can't put down Sully's book, and he's talking about the Wicca religion, you know, witchcraft.  Yeah.  Well, they don't want to be...  It's not working for him?  Yeah, it's working for him, and it's not as, you know, voodoo as people like to think it is.  No?  But it got me thinking that I want to be a free agent.  I want to start, like, studying a bunch of religions, and then I'm going to, like, I'm going to accept a new God into my life. 
[00:31:30]  You're going to play the field?  I'm going to play the field.  You're taking Catholicism and throwing it out the window?  Yeah.  I want a religion where if I do something wrong, it doesn't mean I'm burning in hell for the rest of eternity.  Yeah, but what if that's not the right religion?  I like to eat meat on Fridays.  Anyways, well, that's why I've got to study these religions.  You've got to find a good one that lets you do whatever you want to do.  Let's me do what I want.  With little consequence.  Yeah, much less consequence. 
[00:32:00]  Absolutely.  Okay.  Less guilt.  Looking for a religion with less guilt.  Mm-hmm.  Looking for a religion that accepts sex.  Okay.  So why don't you join a cult?  Yeah, that seems to be...  I don't think any really mainstream.  You might have to go off the beaten path on this one.  No, man.  Most religions are cults.  Who are you kidding?  Well, all of them are.  Who are you kidding?  But I think you're going to have to go off the beaten path of the mainstream religions  and find one of those wacky ones. 
[00:32:30]  I was brought up Catholic.  I believe in something.  I don't know what.  A deity?  You believe in a bigger power?  A larger power?  But I want to see what the Hindus are all about.  I want to look into this Wicca a little bit.  Yeah.  What other religion?  Well, Wicca seems like the type where they're just out in the woods kind of communing with  nature and then having sex and things like that.  But somebody's got to die. 
[00:33:00]  I think you've got to sacrifice people or something.  No, I don't think they have...  They don't have the devil in their religion.  No?  No.  But isn't it a whole thing like Mother Nature and...  Yeah, I like that.  And like the energy of the earth and...  I like that.  And the plants and everything.  Yeah.  I think the American Indians had it all figured out.  Yeah.  And they're doing very well.  And then we decided to wipe them all out for their buffalo and their parts.  Apparently, our God was a little stronger, wasn't it?  Wasn't our God a little more powerful? 
[00:33:30]  A little more mighty?  Maybe for the here and now.  Wow.  I can't wait to see Obi come in with those little Jew curls on the side of his head.  Do Wiccas have that?  Or when he goes Hasidic, you mean?  When he goes Hasidic.  No, he finally decides to go Hasidic.  I was thinking about that the other day.  Actually, I was at an Islander game and it would be tough for me to be Jewish.  Yeah.  Because of the roundy round thing.  You don't want to wear the...  I call it the roundy round.  The roundy round?  Cecil.  It would wreck...  I don't think...  The beanie?  Yeah, I don't think wearing that would compliment my charming cheekbones. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  You don't like the yarmulke?  So I need a religion where you don't have to grow crazy stuff or wear weird things.  I was living in Brooklyn for a while and a lot of Jewish people in Brooklyn.  And you see the young kids going to school and they're trying to be tough and wear kind  of hip-hop clothes, but they got to wear the yarmulke.  Right.  And it...  It's like Ubu on the side.  It takes...  It just takes away every bit of trying to be tough with whatever you're wearing. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  You could have guns hanging from you.  The second you put on the yarmulke, it just kind of takes away from any look you're going  for.  Yeah.  Because I sit behind some guys that wear the yarmulkes at the hockey game and I was  thinking, wow, could I possibly go through life having to wear that in public all the  time?  Yeah.  How about...  I guess that's a pretty vain thing to say, but I don't know.  It just... 
[00:35:00]  Well, it's...  Again, they're doing it for a...  I understand why.  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not mocking them.  Oh, no, I am.  I'm just putting myself in their shoes.  That must suck at times.  Yeah.  I've seen them blow off their head and it's in the middle of traffic and they got to get...  They're chasing it down the street like a hubcap.  And there's like a five...  I think there's like a five-second rule like there is with food.  You got to pick it up within five seconds or something horrific is going to happen to  you in the afterlife.  The wind catches it and it's just rolling down the street on its edge.  And you got five seconds to pick it up, I think. 
[00:35:30]  Five-second rule.  So I don't want to be a Jew.  I don't think I want to be Catholic anymore.  Or any of those offshoots of Catholicism.  Like Protestant.  Yeah, they got like those offshoots where they're like...  Lutheran.  We like the idea, but we don't like this, this, this.  We're going to take this out, this out, this out.  We'll call it something else.  Episcopalian.  Episcopalian.  Whatever that one is.  Baptist.  You want to be a Baptist?  Baptist is pretty cool.  Where you're just, hey, and you're in the church and you're clapping hands.  They know how to have fun. 
[00:36:00]  No, I like that.  Yeah.  Why couldn't we start our own religion?  Where like the Baptist thing, I've been to a few Baptist ceremonies and a service.  Have you?  Yeah, I have.  When?  Huh?  When the hell were you at a Baptist ceremony?  A few times, man.  I check, I check out stuff.  That must have just...  Dude, they're hollering and singing and woo!  Their hands are shaking in the air.  Yeah, this is it right here.  That must have looked like, here's Waldo.  Oh, yeah, I've been in a Baptist church.  Dude, you haven't lived until you've been in a Baptist church. 
[00:36:30]  This is not...  This is pretty much what happens every Sunday.  When did you go to a Baptist church and why?  I went to a Baptist church in Boston.  Oh, wait a minute.  I did.  Did you go to the Baptist breakfast at the...  Not the Hard Rock.  That's not church, that's brunch.  It was brunch.  That's at the House of Blues.  At the House of Blues.  Yeah.  That's as close as I've ever been to a Baptist breakfast.  I've been to a couple Baptist churches and they are singing and dancing. 
[00:37:00]  Did you go with Black Girl?  There's just positive energy.  F Black Girl.  Positive energy.  Hands in the air.  Just singing and dancing.  Playing with snakes.  Oh, yeah.  Snakes.  Oh, no, that was a whole other church.  That was when I was down south, like, just wandering the earth.  I forgot about that one.  I don't know.  I've never been to a Baptist.  There's some great churches out there to check out.  So I want a little Baptist because they know how to have fun on Sundays. 
[00:37:30]  Uh-huh.  They don't speak in monotone like the Catholic faith every Sunday.  Oh, Lord Jesus.  Yes.  I like when they go, forever and ever.  It's like, why do you got to sing?  It's all creepy.  Because they'll be talking.  They'll be like, and if we study the words of Jesus Christ, you will see that there is nothing but love in his word. 
[00:38:00]  It's like, what?  What is this, a musical number?  What are the jets going to come out and start snapping?  I know someone that's singing to you.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  I know some of the faithfuls out there, they joke and they have something called the Church of Opie, but maybe it's time.  Maybe it's time to do the Church of Opie.  You do a little, I want a little wicca in there.  Yeah.  I want a little Baptist in there.  A little Baptist so you can sing and dance. 
[00:38:30]  I enjoy some of the Asian culture, so maybe a little Buddhism.  Buddhism.  I think you'd be a good Mormon.  Mormon?  Yeah, they get to, look what they get to do.  Not anymore legally.  Mormon?  Well, I better not say what I was about to say, but they seem a bit...  Well, it's the Donnie and Marie thing.  They seem to be a bit weird, in my humble opinion.  It's kind of...  I'm not going for creepy, Rich.  I'm going for spirituality.  What does Buddhism have that you would like to embrace? 
[00:39:00]  I don't know.  I know nothing about Buddhism.  That's why I got to study this crap.  I don't know anything about it.  They seem like peace-loving people.  And I want to throw in a little reincarnation, too.  Just a little bit.  Oh, so you want a little...  A little taste of reincarnation, a little taste of the wicca, a little taste of the hands in the air, celebrating.  When I go to a church on Sunday, I want it to be all about singing and dancing, jumping up and down.  That isn't really being a free agent.  You want to start your own team.  Well, I'm not sure.  Maybe...  That's pretty much what you're doing.  Maybe one of these religions will satisfy all these needs. 
[00:39:30]  Hmm.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  That sounds like...  Yeah, cover yourself with a purple flag, chop off your unit, and wait for a spaceship behind a comet.  And put on your Nikes.  Put on your Nikes.  Brad in Atlanta.  What's up, Brad?  Hi, Opie.  I think you should pretty much incorporate a lot of elements of Buddhism in those new religion ears,  because you pretty much don't have to do anything except be as nice as you can.  I know your job doesn't permit that, so I'm sure that's fine, though.  Well, I know Wicked has a bit of karma. 
[00:40:00]  They talk about karma.  Yeah, Buddhism does, too, pretty much.  Oh, boy.  You're going to be reincarnated after you die, and depending on how cool you are is the level, whether you go up or down.  I've done a lot of horrific things in my radio career, but I've also made a lot of people happy.  So I'm thinking that karma might kind of bounce out in the end, I'm hoping.  Yeah.  I'm hoping.  You got a lot of penance to do if you want to...  I'm hoping.  How long has this wicker been around, the one you're talking about? 
[00:40:30]  About 20 years.  20 years?  It's like Scientology.  Yeah, you know.  It's kind of new.  Or, you know what, I want to start a religion based on the Harry Potter novels.  Why not?  Why is that crazy?  Because you can't do magic.  Huh?  Because you can't do magic.  You can't take a little wand and do things.  Yeah.  It doesn't really work.  And if someone is lingering longer, you mother effer, he doesn't have his name up there, but he writes, 
[00:41:00]  you're just looking for your dad's tax break.  Ooh.  Well, it's an old story, but back in the day, my dad became something.  Yeah.  That we, the Hughes's, were an official church.  No reason for the IRS to come after us.  This was official.  Yeah.  My dad was some kind of weird minister where we didn't have to pay taxes.  Well, religious organizations, non-profit organizations, they don't have to pay taxes. 
[00:41:30]  Wow.  This was way back in the 70s, man.  My dad found some kind of whacked out loophole, and it was completely legal at the time.  Yeah, a lot of people were doing that back then, becoming ministers, and then they'd incorporate, they'd make a church and not pay taxes.  And I had to, like, carry around a tax-exempt form to pay for my sneakers and stuff.  What?  Did he also plan corn in your yard?  He said that was a farm and you didn't have to pay property taxes?  Wait, you walked into stores and showed them a form where you didn't pay tax? 
[00:42:00]  Well, my dad would give us these forms, and whenever we purchased something, we were supposed to hand over the form to save on the taxes to show everyone, hey, we're a church and we don't pay taxes.  I was mortified because I'm like, I was a kid in high school with my friends, and I'm going to, like, show this as we're all buying sneakers at the mall or something?  F that.  But then when I came home, I told my dad, yeah, I handed in the form, and I saved $2.48. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, people are saying it sounds like welfare.  It does.  It sounds like you're on the free lunch program.  There's anything more embarrassing than the lunch line at school.  Oh, the free lunch?  Having his form.  People have no idea where I came from, man.  I do very well for myself now, but, man, it was.  I was on the free lunch program for a while, yeah, and it was very embarrassing, so I wouldn't do it. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  I wouldn't walk up.  I'd starve for the day or go out and get pizza.  You got those little tickets?  My mother made us get those.  Oh, they made it, like, really embarrassing where you had to, like, hold the whole lineup, and the woman at the cash register was like,  got another one.  Oh, thanks.  Yes, thanks.  It's embarrassing.  It's already embarrassing.  Thanks for making it even worse.  We're poor.  And thanks for reminding me that we did grow vegetables in the backyard.  Yeah.  A few bucks on groceries, Rich. 
[00:43:30]  Thank you.  Yep.  And that my brothers, my poor twin brothers, had to use their brand new bikes as plows.  Plows.  Yeah, they'd save on property tax because you say it's a farm.  Well, who knows?  Or whatever tax it is.  It sounds like they were one step away from Waco.  We had a...  Should have had the feds coming in and burn your house down.  We had a nice-sized backyard that was perfect for a wiffle ball and a pool that we never got.  That was the thing we talked about year after year after year. 
[00:44:00]  Ah, this year we'll get the pool.  We're going to get a nice big pool in the backyard, playing wiffle ball and chipping golf balls and playing football.  Perfect yard for five boys until we decided to turn it into a farm to save money on groceries.  And my little brother's got bicycles one year, and they even at this point, I think they were 10 and they knew something was up.  They were suspicious.  Why brand new bikes at 10 years old?  And sure enough, my dad showed how they could put a long board between the bikes and kind of ride together through the farm to flatten it out so we could plant some seed. 
[00:44:30]  That's great.  Did he get you yokes to put around your neck, too, and pull, like, farm machinery, little house on the prairie?  When you weren't churning butter, were you guys Amish?  What was...  My brother says that we didn't have bedrooms.  We had barracks.  I'd like to...  They were always putting us to work around the house. 
[00:45:00]  I'd like to add a name to the weirdo list for today.  The Hughes family.  Hey, we've got another...  We'll add this one to the list, too.  Chris, Cleveland, good afternoon.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Yeah, I got a weirdo for that list.  Yeah.  You know, that Tom Cruise guy's a weirdo.  Mr. Man.  Mr. Man.  Tom Cruise, it's a Tom Cruise.  It's a little Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise, it's a little Tom Cruise.  You've got to linger longer for that one. 
[00:45:30]  Very good, Chris.  Let me play this for you, too.  And punt.  Yeah, and punt on that.  Yeah.  Tom Cruise is on our weirdo list today.  One more before we take a break?  Sure.  Let's go to...  Dana Reeves Lung.  Is that a name?  I guess so.  From Wackbag.  What's up, sir?  Dana Reeves Lung.  How's it going, guys?  Good morning.  We'll just call you DRL.  What's up, DRL?  How about Marilyn Manson with his recent purchase of Chinese kid skeletons? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, Marilyn Manson in a little bit of a jam up.  He's being sued by band members saying that he squandered their money on purchases that  were a little odd.  Asian children's skeletons, he seems to be into.  And skin and stuff, too, right?  And skin, like things like, yeah, what, lampshades made out of skin?  Oh, no.  And he's into Nazi memorabilia.  Right.  Which, you know, doesn't make you a bad person as long as you're just into the era.  If you're into the era and collectibles like that and not embracing the ideology of the 
[00:46:30]  Nazis, I see no problem with that.  You would have got along great with my dad.  Oh, really?  Finding ways around things.  Well, no, I'm just saying.  Like, my uncle over Thanksgiving showed me a beautiful knife.  And it had, you know, a swastika and SS symbols emblazoned upon them.  And it was an actual knife that was given to Hitler youth back in the 30s.  And a very nice knife. 
[00:47:00]  I mean, if you look at it not as, oh, boy, I'm a Nazi.  This is great.  You look at it like, wow, this is a piece of history.  You know, good, bad, or different, whatever it is, it's just a piece of history.  Yes, you now have a clip of me saying I'm a Nazi.  There you go.  Hey, we've got to take a break.  We're running a little late here.  We've got a bunch of people who want to talk about religion.  We've got Max in Dallas.  My chick is Wiccan.  She allows other girls in bed.  Someone has suggested I try Satanism. 
[00:47:30]  Great.  Alan in Brooklyn, stay where you're at.  He wants me to be a Baptist.  Oh, don't be a Baptist.  He's going to tell me why.  But why?  They look like they're celebrating every Sunday.  All the time.  But I think during the rest of the time, it's very strict.  And do they do that House of Blues brunch still in Boston?  I'm sure they do.  A little food and a little God.  I got talked into going to that thing.  All right, we'll talk about that.  Oh, did that suck?  I was just talking about that recently, how much fun I had doing that. 
[00:48:00]  It sucked.  All right, we'll explain that.  I got dragged to it.  All right, we'll explain next.  And then Mike and Jersey Lutheran, because their weddings are really cool.  We'll find out why.  Yeah.  Lutheran weddings are cool as well.  I am a religious free agent.  Free agent.  That's right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Rich Voss in for Jim Norton today.  And Rich is going to be at Wisecrackers in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Friday and Saturday night. 
[00:48:30]  Right, Rich?  Yep.  866-424-2411 if you're in the area and you want to see Rich Voss.  And there's someone on the line.  I just want to acknowledge this, Rich.  Matt and Jersey, Voss killed Saturday.  Oh, nice, Matt.  Rich is great on a comedy stage.  Thank you.  Okay on the radio.  Great.  I'm just effing with you.  Isn't that the thing you were talking about?  Yeah, yeah.  You're right, because like my family, like we were like the black sheep. 
[00:49:00]  Nobody liked us.  But when we'd have like a Seder at my uncle's house, my brother and I would go there and  we wouldn't have yarmulkes.  We were just like trash.  Wow, you were the tough guys.  And so he had the yarmulkes for his family and they were all embroidered and beautiful  yarmulkes.  And then, you know, he had, just in case of emergency yarmulkes, he'd give us like two  little black pieces of linen or whatever just to put on our heads.  And it was like, we're sitting around with like just crap yarmulkes when all my cousins  have like the best looking yarmulkes.  Is that like a big thing?  Is that like a status symbol if you got a really good yarmulke or like the crappy like 
[00:49:30]  store-bought little yarmulke?  And what makes a best looking yarmulke?  Well, it's got nice embroidery.  You ever see the embroidered ones that have like little sayings on them?  Yeah.  You know, Hebrew writings, whatnot.  Yeah, those are the good ones.  We, you know.  Those are the good ones.  Are Jews supposed to keep like yarmulkes in the house just in case of emergency?  Well, you never know when a rabbi should drop in or something.  It's like the Dixie cup version of the yarmulke.  You just kind of pull it out of a dispenser and throw it at somebody and put that on. 
[00:50:00]  I have two in my drawer.  One, a nice satin one in my dresser drawer that I've never used, but I have them because,  you know, I don't know.  And even if you...  You never know when a Jew's going to drop by.  And where are you guys at with like corporate logos?  I should just start selling advertising space on those things.  I'm actually being serious.  Is that against the religion?  I'm not really up on...  Or no one's brave enough to give it a try?  Like, you know, I got a good idea. 
[00:50:30]  We want to start a youth movement.  Why don't we have corporate logos on the yarmulkes?  City bank.  Things like that.  You know, band logos, something.  I'm being serious.  Is that like frowned upon?  Is that like, what are you talking about stuff?  I don't know.  Bringing blatant commercialism into the religion like that would probably, yeah.  They'd probably frown upon that.  Hey, let's...  The elders.  Let's say hi to Alan in Brooklyn.  Alan, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Listen, I got to warn you.  Do not be a Baptist.  Anthony was totally right. 
[00:51:00]  Now, if you're a black Baptist, it's fine because you get to dance and do stuff.  But if you're a white conservative Baptist, you can't drink, you can't smoke, nothing.  I've been in therapy for 12 years because of that.  No, I want to be a black Baptist.  You can't.  How could you be a black Baptist?  I don't know.  I've been in a Baptist church.  Black people, like, hollering and dancing and their hands in the air like they just don't care.  Yeah?  Yeah, but then...  I want to be that type of Baptist.  You ever see the movies then?  And then they go home and they're very strict with their grandchildren. 
[00:51:30]  I've seen it.  And they dunk you in water.  They don't let them go out.  Are you getting your knowledge from movies?  From Boys in the Hood.  From Boys in the Hood.  All right.  And Menace to Society.  Or Little Rascals.  They dunk the kids.  Little Rascals.  Yeah, remember when he snuck, spanking them, we were camping and they walked onto the bathroom.  Oh, right, yeah.  Dunking them.  And they were very scared.  Scared.  All right.  Thank you, Alan.  That was my Opie walking.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, why are Lutheran weddings cool? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, there are a lot of amens and hallelujahs and talking about the meat you're going to  eat and stuff like that.  It doesn't sound very fun.  Yeah, you said Lutheran weddings are cool.  That's cool.  The ceremonies are short, too.  I mean, huge...  You can't wait to get to the drink.  Well, that's good.  There's nothing worse than a Catholic wedding ceremony.  Holy mother.  Half hour and it's done.  For hours, you're sitting there.  Drinking.  And you know what's good about Lutheran?  They're the only ones that had a cartoon.  They had that Davy and Goliath in the morning.  Oh, they did.  That was the Lutheran church.  Yeah, they had a cartoon. 
[00:52:30]  All right, look.  Any religion that believes in talking dogs, I'm out.  So, let's cross Lutheran off the list.  I can't be a Lutheran.  You didn't like that?  No.  Hey, wait.  Everything was about God, Davy.  No, that's...  Whatever problem it was, the father would always at the end go, God made that cotter pin  slip out of your go-kart wheel, Davy.  Oh, now I get it.  It's like just guilt the hell out of the kids.  Right.  With God.  That's what people do now.  They guilt you when you're young.  God will punish you.  Yeah.  And I just grow up with a fear of God. 
[00:53:00]  Well, that's who you're supposed to have.  That's why I'm a free agent.  Less guilt.  That's the number one thing I'm looking for.  Less guilt and less fear.  12-step program is what you need because it's a God of your choice.  That's what it is.  It's a God of your choice.  It's spiritual.  So, you could choose.  You could say, He-Man, Master of the Universe, is my God.  My Captain Morgan.  He could be your guy.  I don't think that works.  No, not Captain Morgan.  With the 12 steps.  Arr.  Captain Morgan. 
[00:53:30]  Arr.  I would write that down because it's a God of your choice.  I'm going to write that down.  Hey, we got Sam in studio.  He knows a little bit about the commercialization of yarmulkes.  What's up there, Sam?  Yeah, they're already doing that with yarmulkes.  When I was younger, I went to a bar mitzvah, and there were kids with, like, Batman yarmulkes on.  Batman yarmulkes?  He literally had the black and yellow Batman symbol on, like, a blue yarmulke.  That was a party, right?  I guess.  Do they have party?  So, you were wearing a party hat.  No, it's not my yarmulke hat.  No, it was a yarmulke party hat. 
[00:54:00]  I guess so.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Is he Jewish?  No.  No, no.  He's Baptist.  Yeah, he's so Baptist.  Look at him, Baptist.  Are you?  Of course you are.  Holy jeez, another hint comes out.  Of course you are.  You're Baptist?  Yeah, my...  So, do they sing in the church?  No, I'm not.  I never went to a church like that, but in the South, they do.  My grandfather was...  Your grandpappy?  Yeah, he was a Southern Baptist minister. 
[00:54:30]  Not in a singing church.  Really?  Yeah.  Can he make you take your bicycle and plow the backyard?  No.  You are so black.  When are you going to admit you're black?  Well, he was a white Southern Baptist minister.  Yeah, sure he was.  We want to call the Guinness Book of World Records.  We have found the whitest black guy.  Yeah.  He's right here every morning with us.  Everything about you is black, except for one thing.  You're not black.  Yeah.  But everything about you is.  And he's in the middle of Afro Wars.  The Afro's starting to grow out. 
[00:55:00]  The white man Afro.  Yeah.  There's not a hint of straight hair in there, man.  No.  That is really, like, kinky.  You got, like, very tight curls.  Yeah, that's, uh...  You are the whitest black guy to merge?  Yeah.  Right here.  Right in front of us.  This is amazing.  Baptist, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  And do you practice Baptist?  Not really.  Do you have parents?  Sam.  I don't know if this is insulting.  I'm going to say this right off the bat. 
[00:55:30]  Let me just say, it will be.  All right.  I will bet $1,000 that this will be.  I just got a suggestion, because, you know, we're all very curious about you.  Mm-hmm.  What if we took a picture of you, a nice photo of you right now, and then we allow the listeners  to maybe work with the shading?  With the shading, and...  So we could kind of make our own assessment.  That would be good, because it's very hard to, like, look at you, because you're so white  skinned. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  It's very hard to picture you with darker skin, so we can't get the full picture.  And I would do the same.  Like, take a picture of me, and you can mess with the shade, and you'll go, wow, obviously,  he's a white boy.  Yeah.  But if we shade you up a little, I'm thinking it's going to look a bit natural.  Yeah.  I'd say we could do that.  Like me.  Can we get a picture of...  Yeah, get just a face picture.  Of Sam.  Full frontal.  And then we'll shade it up a little bit, just to see.  Can we do that? 
[00:56:30]  All right.  And while we have Sam in here, you gave us this yesterday, the Ric Flair thing, and you've  been pushing for us to play this.  Why?  Well, just because I...  Because he's a wrestling dork.  Yeah, I know you like the wrestling thing.  I didn't mean dork.  No, I didn't mean dork.  Ric Flair is a legend in the wrestling field, obviously.  Yeah, but for some reason, the news, and now they've reported on it again today...  Oh, they did?  But yes, he's making a huge deal about the fact that he is getting behind Mike Huckabee  in the race for president. 
[00:57:00]  Ah.  Yeah, some weird celebrities, pseudo-celebrities, are starting to get behind candidates, and  the news is picking up on it.  Like, what's his name over there from the Bunny Ranch?  Oh, Dennis Hoff.  Yeah, Dennis Hoff backed a candidate, and that made news?  Like, who really cares if these guys back anybody?  They can't actually go, no, no, no, don't back me.  But Huckabee, he was excited about this?  Yeah, he was actually... 
[00:57:30]  Do we know anything about Huckabee?  No, I don't know a thing about him.  All right, good.  Do we want to know anything about Mike Huckabee?  I don't think so.  It's all about Ron Paul.  Ron Paul!  What?  But he, yeah, he was at a press conference wooing.  He was wooing?  Yeah, right behind us here for Mike Huckabee.  Of course.  Woo!  All right, why not just get Fez?  He can do it.  All right, here's Ric Flair endorsing Mike Huckabee.  And he has to tell everyone that he's sane and qualified to endorse a candidate? 
[00:58:00]  Oh.  No, I was making a point that...  Oh, you were editorializing.  What?  It was a sarcastic quip.  Oh, okay.  So, you know, basically you're saying we shouldn't take Ric Flair serious.  That would be one option.  Okay, here we go.  Here's Ric Flair.  Woo!  Woo!  That's weird for Mike Huckabee!  Nature boy Ric Flair showing his support for Republican candidate Mike Huckabee.  The two met up at the big in-state rivalry football game between University of South Carolina and Clemson. 
[00:58:30]  Flair says, quote, Huckabee is a quality person with a great vision.  Woo!  Unquote.  I'm excited.  Thank you for that.  Woo!  That was one of the news people?  Yeah, they're saying woo on the news.  That's wonderful.  Woo!  And then the next clip is Ric Flair in the ring?  Yeah, yeah.  On Monday night, he came out and made some ridiculous comments about never retiring until he was dead in the ring.  Oh, and that's why we shouldn't take him seriously. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  He did his endorsement, right?  Okay, I see where you're going.  But I know sooner or later, there'll be a time for me to retire.  But tonight, right here in Charlotte, North Carolina, and in front of the world, I have to announce to you that I will never retire!  I will only retire when I'm dead in this ring! 
[00:59:30]  Wow!  How great would that have been if he dropped dead right then and there?  Woo!  I'm still an H-boy!  The whole world is seeing this right now.  Yeah.  People in Bangladesh are screaming.  So there you go.  He's insane and he shouldn't be endorsing anybody.  That's what Sam's getting at.  And by the way, he's setting up a great wrestling angle right there.  That's what he's going to do.  He's going to end up dying in the ring.  Quote, dying in the ring.  Oh, oh, I gotcha. 
[01:00:00]  And that'll be it.  A little work.  Huh?  Yeah, there's a limo out back that'll explode with his little pant leg hanging out.  We go to Dubronx.  Jessica, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Thank you, Sam.  I just wanted to let you know about the yarmulkes.  Okay.  They only put the childish images on kids' yarmulkes.  They don't put any corporate logos or anything on there.  And the only images that they'll put on there are Superman or Batman, and they'll do that for kids. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, and that kind of probably gets the kids, like, psyched to wear them.  Well, I'm looking at yarmulkes that are in the shape of basketballs, you know,  with the lines and stuff, and baseballs, and tennis balls, and volleyballs.  How come Catholicism only has horrific memories for children that last a lifetime?  Catholicism sucks.  Oh.  Hey.  Don't you start ragging on my religion.  Okay, fine.  I'm sorry. 
[01:01:00]  Okay.  We can all get against the Muslims.  We're going to have to have a battle royale.  Yeah.  Get all the religions in one wrestling ring.  Who do you think would kick ass the most?  I'm sorry, Rich, but the Jewish people, not really known for their fighting prowess.  I'm just talking about a battle, no weapons.  Go to Israel and say that.  I'm saying.  Well, what are you saying?  First of all, I'm talking about here in America.  I'm not talking about Israelis.  I'm talking about American Jews.  Okay. 
[01:01:30]  We get a ring.  We get somebody from each religion to go in there and bare-fisted knuckle fighting.  Okay.  I think the Jew is out first.  Okay, yeah, but here's the thing.  The second person, when he gets knocked out or she gets knocked out, what doctor are they going to go see?  What lawyer is going to sue the person that hit him?  I say Buddha wins.  You think Buddha?  How are you going to move him around a ring?  I'm not talking about the religious icons.  I say you go icons.  No, because how is Jesus going to fight? 
[01:02:00]  No, the Muslims, the Farrakhan Muslims, not the other.  They're going to win because they're all karate experts.  Yeah, I think the Muslims probably got an edge.  Yeah.  Although, no, the Baptists, you could probably get a pretty good-sized Baptist in there.  Like, what's his name?  Coffee from Green Mile.  Oh, God.  No, I think you've got to go with the symbol, the icon himself.  You've got to get Jesus in there.  Buddha's too fat. 
[01:02:30]  Buddha, you're not going to be able to move around.  Buddha's not going to be able to move.  Well, but Buddha can go, you know, he's going to run out of strength and endurance.  But a few of the icons could, like, kind of team up and get Buddha, you know, over the top rope.  A little help.  Yeah.  Sure.  Oh, like a battle royal.  Well, you've got to get a couple of religions to work together to get Buddha out of the ring.  That's the only way, though.  Poor Jesus, though.  I don't know.  You get motivation.  Is this pre- or post-crucifixion? 
[01:03:00]  Pre-crucifixion Jesus?  Yeah.  Because post-crucifixion Jesus, you're kicking ass.  You got him angry.  You got some power.  You got some, you know.  You got him angry.  He's back, and he's...  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Let's...  Yeah, we're going to have to work that out.  Let's go to Sarah, Rhode Island.  What's up, Sarah?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right, so at the beginning of this topic, you had said that you wanted a religion where  you could pretty much do whatever you want.  Well, I've actually read the Satanic Bible.  I'm not a Satanist, just to clear that up right there. 
[01:03:30]  But just for an interesting read, I read the Satanic Bible, and pretty much what it says  is you can do whatever you want, you just got to realize that there are going to be consequences  with your actions.  Uh-huh.  And it's not as, like, preachy, hail Satan as everyone thinks.  Wait, wait, you're endorsing Satanism as something that isn't very, like, Satan-y?  Well, it's not really, like, what everyone thinks is.  It's not all about, like, let's cut ourselves and, like, do some sort of weird ritual. 
[01:04:00]  Well, what the hell is it?  You're praying to Satan.  Yeah, but they get to wear logos.  No, I don't pray.  Well, I mean you being the general you, if, you know, stick with me here.  It's pretty much just being for yourself and doing things for yourself, taking care of  yourself, because no one's going to take care of you.  Isn't that like an atheist?  Yeah, I suppose, yeah.  But where does Satan come in?  How does Satan help you?  Like, God, you supposedly, you know, you pray to him, and your prayers might get answered. 
[01:04:30]  But with Satan, do you pray to Satan if you're a Satanist?  I mean, I'm sure you could, but I think it's more you just do everything for yourself and  just do what you want.  Just realize that there are going to be consequences for your actions.  But that's just going through life.  That doesn't sound like Satan's helping you.  I want, if I'm going to pray to Satan, I want fire to be able to shoot out of my eyes,  and I want to be able to do like some evil magic.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:05:00]  I want this music to follow me everywhere.  And then, when it all ends and you die, of course, your soul is going to burn for eternity,  and you'll be in eternal hell, and it'll suck.  But during the time you're alive and praying to Satan, you should be able to just kick ass  with magic.  No more road rage for you, Ant.  Oh, hell no.  I wave my hand, the car flies off the road.  That's right.  Bursts into flames.  The whole family dies.  That's right.  And I drive on, knowing that I am cursed for all eternity when it ends. 
[01:05:30]  But in the meantime, you're having a blast.  You're praying to Satan.  You're just driving and walking all over New York City with this music following you?  Yeah.  Who's going to mess with you, man?  No one.  A long, black, flowing leather that moves in slow motion for some reason in the wind.  Yeah.  And you can just look at somebody, and they shrivel to the ground.  That's Satanism.  You never would have to wait on another line.  No.  No lines.  One wave of the hand, and everyone drops dead.  That's it.  And blows away into dust. 
[01:06:00]  That's if they don't move ahead of time.  They see you coming.  They're just letting you go right up to the register.  Pure evil.  I don't care.  Pure evil.  Pure evil.  Not, what are you talking about?  Well, you do things for yourself.  Right.  No.  I want pentagrams.  I want sacrifices.  I want evil.  Fire, lightning, brimstone.  All that fun stuff.  And lots of unprotected sex.  Unprotected sex.  With concubines. 
[01:06:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Bring on the concubines.  More concubines.  Just sex and evilness.  Oh.  Biting.  Sex on altars.  Blood.  Wow.  I'm kind of liking this.  This sounds cool.  I'm getting my info.  Damn.  I'm getting my info from The Devil's Advocate or whatever that movie was called.  Oh, I'll live out those dreams that I have when I realize I'm dreaming and I just ravage  anyone near me. 
[01:07:00]  Did he tell you about that one, Rich?  When I'm dreaming and I know I'm in a dream.  You ever have that happen?  Yeah.  The first thing I do is just grab girls and start ravaging them in my dream because I  know it's a dream and I'm not going to get in trouble.  That is what Satanism is about.  Really doing it.  And then if the cops come, you wave your hand and the police cars just explode and you'll  walk away in slow motion.  Yeah.  There you go.  Hey, we can't get to all these calls.  Christian and Jersey.  Her version of Satanism stunk. 
[01:07:30]  Yours is pretty.  What was that?  Yours mind kicks ass.  Yours is pretty cool.  You're having sex?  You're killing people?  Her version is what goes around comes around.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Satan was laughing at her.  I know.  Satan was just smiling when I was talking right there.  He's going, yeah, that's what it's about.  I like this kid.  Someone got my lesson.  And I say kid because Satan is like.  10,000 years old.  Someone was paying attention in school.  Yeah.  Christian from Jersey.  Muslims would win.  Suicide bombers.  Mm.  And then you got.  Can't bring that into the ring.  What do you think this is? 
[01:08:00]  Baptists would win because they're packing.  They're packing some heat.  But that Jesus thing, when he comes back, though, he'd be easy to poke in the eye.  You know, he goes to block and he's got.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, don't make fun of our guy, man.  Don't make fun of our Lord and Savior.  That's not funny now.  Now you guys, you went too far.  That's not funny.  Let's go to Steve in New York.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, bro?  Hey, man.  But I think that, honestly, you should be an atheist.  I mean, if you look at the Christian religion, check this out. 
[01:08:30]  Michelangelo painted the picture of Christ, right?  Yeah.  Michelangelo was a homo.  Who says Michelangelo was a homo?  I don't know.  As you put it, homo.  How do we know he was a homo?  It was bisexual.  It's a fact.  How do you know it's a fact?  I just love when people throw this out, like people that were alive hundreds of years ago,  and it's like, wait a minute. 
[01:09:00]  How do you know?  He certainly wasn't a practicing homo, because he spent, what, 10 years on his back.  Yeah.  At some point, you've got to roll over.  If he was a homo, he would have painted the floor.  Check this out.  Hey, don't mess up my dad.  That's the very rare laugh that I get on this show.  Get lost. 
[01:09:30]  You were used as a setup.  Go to work.  He went from homo to bisexual.  Wow.  Yeah, see, the guy backpedaled pretty quickly there.  Hanging up on a lot of people here, because we're trying to, like, get the...  All right, Max has been waiting, and we've got to take a break.  I know, Than.  Max, Dallas, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Jesus Christ, relax, Anstantine.  Anstantine.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bye.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Hey, what's up with your Cowboys? 
[01:10:00]  I don't want to go there, man.  They suck.  I hate them.  You don't like the Cowboys?  No.  You're in Dallas?  What is going on with our listeners today?  I talked to a dude from Cleveland.  He hates LeBron James.  Talking to Max in Dallas.  Doesn't like his 10-1 Cowboys.  Losing their loyalties.  What?  Losing their team loyalties.  Who do you like, Max?  Originally, I'm from Louisiana, and I'm a diehard Saints fan, even though they suck ass, so...  Are you a Pistol Pete fan?  Oh, the best.  Uh, not really. 
[01:10:30]  Nah.  LSU?  Nothing?  Oh, LSU, definitely.  Okay.  Definitely.  So, uh...  So, what football team do you follow?  The Tigers.  LSU Tigers.  Oh, so you don't even go NFL?  College.  Yeah, yeah.  I said I like the Saints.  Oh, the Saints.  They stink.  They stink.  How can you not like Pistol Pete?  He's the greatest white ball handler ever.  I don't know.  I just never...  Why do you have to say the greatest white ball handler?  Yeah, Rich. 
[01:11:00]  Because that's my religion.  You're scared to insult people?  It's your religion, white.  He's probably one of the greatest ball handlers of all time.  I have a Shorkie card.  Even the brothers admit that they got a lot of moves from NFL Pete.  Apparently, Michelangelo was.  He loved it.  I don't know.  Well, you got the Packers and Cowboys tomorrow night, both 10-1.  That's why I brought that up.  But, uh, whatever.  Max, what do you got?  Anyhow, uh, my girls are wicked.  And it's great, man, because if you want to get tattoos, you can get tattoos. 
[01:11:30]  She's brought other girls into the bed.  They do this deal where they, like, do this commune with nature.  And they go out in the backyard and they get nude, you know.  Sounds like one of those HBO things.  Yeah.  Oh, and we didn't talk about Towson Blues Baptist.  Ah, yeah.  What was it called?  The Bab.  Uh.  Yeah, the Baptist brunch.  Oh, what was it called?  The Bab, uh, uh, whatever.  Whatever.  So, that's why I should be, uh, Wiccan?  Well, Dad.  Sounds like the chicks are pretty wild. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, but I don't need the extra girls in bed.  It sounds like deadhead chicks.  I like deadhead chicks.  They're like deadhead chicks.  I used to love deadhead chicks.  And it's a religion.  So, if they're, you think they're Wiccan?  Yeah, I think, like, hairy armpits.  No.  Uh, hairy legs.  Um, I like deadhead chicks.  They weren't all freaking hairy armpits.  Uh, no, every single one of them.  No, no.  Yes, everyone.  I remember seeing it.  No.  Uh, everyone.  But I don't know if I could do the nude thing in the woods.  Nude in the woods?  I don't know if I could do that.  Not with any other guys. 
[01:12:30]  I'll tell you that much.  No.  But if they're just nude women and you're like, hey, hey, ladies.  You just stumble upon them.  Oh, I was just collecting wood.  Yeah.  Well.  Time to pray to our Lord.  Wink, wink.  Hold on a minute.  I'll be ready to pray to our Lord in a minute.  Yeah.  Let me just take my clothes off.  I'm ready to pray to our Lord.  The Wiccan Priestess.  Yes.  The best part, the best part about it, Hope, is that they're really laid back.  Out of every chick I've ever dated or been with in my life, they're the less, they 
[01:13:00]  they fix the less because they just kind of accept stuff and, you know, go on.  Of course they do.  How much pot does she smoke, dude?  Be honest.  Quite a bit.  Yeah.  See, that's the thing about the Wiccan religion, along with deadheads.  If you're smoking pot and a lot of it, you'll be mellow.  Yeah.  I'm getting closer to smoking pot.  You want to smoke pot again?  Yeah.  I've been talking about this for a while now, but I think I'm almost there.  I don't think I'm, I don't think I would.  What I'm going to do, though, I'm going to, I'm going to start slow. 
[01:13:30]  Like the next vacation, I'm going to, I'm going to find one of those, you know, one  of those guys walking the beaches.  Yeah.  Going to just take a little, get a little taste.  And then I'm going to, then I'm going to decide if I want to hit, if I bring it back to America  or not.  Yeah.  Just one hit.  Yeah.  I haven't smoked pot, uh, over 10 years.  Yeah.  Long time.  People think we're shock jocks.  We're drugging and boozing and all that, but well, no pot in over 10 years.  I'm not drugging.  No drugs in, in, in 10 years. 
[01:14:00]  No, probably longer actually for the, for the other stuff.  Oh, that, well, that's out of fashion.  That stuff went out in the eighties.  Believe me.  Alcohol is the oldest known drug to man.  Oh, of course it is.  Okay.  Give us your 12 step program.  That's easy.  He might be involved in it.  So calm down.  Yeah.  I want, I want 11 steps to lead right up to an open window.  That's what I want for you, Rich.  All right.  Thank you, Max.  All right, man.  Take it easy. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, our own butcher wants to donate his gas mask bong to me.  Nice.  Wow.  You can't start off smoking pot again after 10 years with a gas mask bong.  You got to like take one hit off a joint and put it out and sit there a little while and  absorb it in and figure how this is feeling.  Not, you don't go right to the gas mask bong.  Dude, I was, I, we got to take a break, but man, I was, I was really into this girl in college  and I used to get, uh, high with her and her friends and they did the gas mask, uh, bong 
[01:15:00]  and I never got anything, uh, accomplished.  How could you?  Out of our freaking minds.  Do you have that glass carburetor that went like four feet long and someone would hold  the end?  Oh yeah.  We, where it took two people to work the bong.  Oh yeah.  The carburetor, hold down the carburetor.  Okay.  Let it go.  You clear the tube and just be so high.  You couldn't even think I, we had the hardcore pot smokers in my fraternity where they named 
[01:15:30]  their bongs.  Yeah.  You're not a pothead until you've named your, and you got to give it a funny name.  Oh yeah.  A funny name.  What was the one?  Billy Bong Thornton.  Was that one?  I can't remember, man.  These guys all named their bongs and I can't remember the names for the life of me.  Maybe some figs are out there.  They can help me out on instant feedback or something.  You had the guy in the neighborhood that made them out of bamboo and so I would sell them  to everybody.  Oh, all that crap.  Yeah, Rich.  Like smoking out of carrots and apples. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  I, I, I never had a four foot bong because they weren't, uh, I couldn't have it in the  house and I wasn't going to carry it with me.  There was one guy in our fraternity, he had a bong where you had to like stand on the sofa  and then someone would have to be way down on the floor to help you out there.  And then two people, you're standing on ladders.  What the hell is that?  I'm trying to smoke pot here.  I want a hookah.  I did it on top of my chimney in the fireplace.  There you go.  They'd put a bale of a pot in there and you'd just stick your head in the chimney.  Yeah, you better start out with just puffing like one, one, one hit. 
[01:16:30]  I think I might just do a little taste next time I'm on one of those beach vacations.  Let it like, uh, maybe collect in your mouth and blow it out your nose and see if any blood  cells like pick it up that way.  Yeah.  I don't even think you should inhale at first.  Just let Rogan breathe on you.  That's true.  Yeah.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're real late.  I don't even know what the F we're doing today, but I know we're having fun.  I like yapping. 
[01:17:00]  Nothing in particular.  Yeah, we're yapping.  We got to talk about that brunch and why you hated it back in the day.  Yeah, well, I hated it because I was dragged to it by the ex and the mother-in-law, I believe.  I wasn't that happy either back in the day, but I enjoyed the, what was it called?  A bar tab was like $650.  Jesus.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  We'll continue.  Moving right along.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Kind of screwing around today. 
[01:17:30]  There's really not much to talk about as far as, uh, the world goes.  Yeah, who cares?  I mean, we all saw Bush trying to do like a Mideast peace thing.  This is the block.  That's kind of hack at this point.  It really is.  Presidential hackery.  That's hackery.  Yeah, we should talk about presidential hackery one day.  Hackery.  Like pardoning the turkey every year, especially while we're in the middle of a war.  The Easter egg hunt on the White House lawn.  That's presidential hackery. 
[01:18:00]  Hackery.  Trying to get like, uh, a Palestinian and, uh, and the other dude to shake hands.  That's hackery.  That's presidential hackery.  Inviting the, uh, winner of the World Series to the White House.  Presidential hackery.  Hackery.  Walking across the White House lawn with a little doggy.  Presidential hackery.  Hack.  Well, it's, okay, the, uh, the, uh, Sam Blackness picture is, it looks more orange.  It looks like one of those, uh, natives we were, we were watching on Discovery. 
[01:18:30]  Well, uh, we know that Sam is, uh, is a black man, but he's the whitest black man ever.  He's got white skin.  And he's just not willing to admit it to us.  Yeah.  We found out today he's a Baptist.  Yep.  Which just kind of moves the needle a little closer.  And, um, let's see, there he is.  He's got a big afro.  His nostrils are black, too.  If you look at his nostrils.  There are just certain features, but, but he's completely white.  He's, like, the lightest skinned black person ever. 
[01:19:00]  Well, uh, that would get me fired.  Uh, probably.  We'll just stop with he's God.  So this, um.  So this picture, he looks a little more orange.  Yeah.  Than, uh, black.  And his face is kind of in a shadow, so it's hard to tell.  Good, good first attempt, obviously.  But.  Well, basically, we're getting, uh, pictures of Sam.  We're gonna throw him up online.  Then we're gonna have people kind of, like, shade him in to make him look like a black guy  to see if he actually would look like a black guy. 
[01:19:30]  We need a face shot.  That's what we need.  Just a straight on face shot.  Right.  And then, uh, go to town.  And then we'll have some fun with that.  Let's say hi to Kelly in Boston listening on BCN.  Kelly, what's up?  Hey, it's the Gospel Brunch at the House of Blues.  Yeah, thanks.  Ah, the Gospel Brunch.  The Gospel Brunch at the House of Blues, uh, out there in Cambridge.  Uh, but that, that, uh, House of Blues closed down, right?  Yeah.  I guess we're getting way too local, but I used to love going to the Gospel Brunch on  Sundays, uh, uh, over there in Cambridge. 
[01:20:00]  Uh, just.  You couldn't even eat your brunch.  You had to stand up, sit down.  Exactly.  I would, all I wanted to do was eat.  You didn't.  And have a couple of cocktails.  You didn't enjoy singing along to, and when the saints, and when the saints.  I go marching in.  And there's people, like, walking around you.  Yeah.  Like, I'm just trying to eat some, some waffles.  And they had.  I'm having some waffles here.  And they had to jazz it up to make it their own.  You can't make, uh, when the saints come marching in your own song. 
[01:20:30]  No.  But they would try.  With some bozy, bozy bops and all sorts of stuff.  I just wanted to have a Bloody Mary and, uh, maybe some, uh, eggs.  Yeah.  A little sausage.  And, uh, that's it.  And grits.  And I got, yeah.  Yeah, and then they pulled out the grits.  I don't eat grits.  Well, it was Southern.  I don't eat grits.  The beauty was, it was Southern food, so you get a little taste of another culture, and  you get a little taste of another religion. 
[01:21:00]  The gospel brunch ruled.  Don't, uh, don't want it.  Didn't like it.  Took the, uh, because I got dragged there by the ex and, uh, the ex-mother-in-law.  Yeah.  And I think Ani Mag.  Where's the sign?  Ani Mag!  Oh, is she alive still?  No.  Oh.  No, long dead.  That's like going to a pancake breakfast or something.  Why would you go?  Because they wanted to go to the, I want to go to the gospel brunch at the House of Blues. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Let's go.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thanks, Kelly.  And, and, uh, they thought it was fantastic.  Yeah.  Because for 10 minutes in, anything would have seemed fantastic.  Uh, I was a fan myself, but.  I, I really wasn't, uh, into it.  I, I wanted to, I could have, I wanted to go to Denny's.  I didn't care.  I was hungry.  I wasn't hungry for some guy coming up and clapping in my face, telling me I got to stand  up and dance.  You know, they like the people to participate. 
[01:22:00]  And I'm just looking at my food going, it's getting cold.  I'm starving.  And there were flies on it.  Yeah.  There were flies on my waffles.  So I couldn't eat them.  So I wound up drinking a lot of Bloody Marys, not eating and driving home.  They had Bloody Marys.  Thank God I had prayed.  Yes, they did.  They had alcohol.  Oh, yeah.  Alcohol.  That's why I love this religion.  It's like a brunch thing.  So, you know, brunch is, is drinking.  Brunch, Bloody Marys, grits, and, uh, and when the saints come marching in. 
[01:22:30]  You dried out drunks miss out on so much.  We got, oh, they're shooting craps.  They really do.  I'm shooting craps in the back room.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, let's say hi to Matt in Virginia.  Uh, Matt.  Hey, is this, I mean, February is going to be Sam History Month, where he brings in his  family, uh, three.  We get the best suggestions from our listeners.  I'm telling you right now.  Yep.  And we have no problem, uh, allowing the listeners to help the radio show.  Uh, Matt, you just came up with it because a lot of people are going, let's have Sam, 
[01:23:00]  Sam, uh, December.  December.  No.  Sam History Month is perfect.  Sam History Month.  Someone has to remind us because we're a couple months out, but February will be Sam History  Month.  We want to know, uh, things Sam has done, accomplishments.  Yep.  Uh, Sam's history, family history, things like that.  It's Sam History Month.  And we'll even play the audio of Sam from his Nickelodeon days.  Of course.  All part of Sam History Month.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony. 
[01:23:30]  Sam was on Nickelodeon.  Yes, he was a little kid.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, all I can say is thank God we're almost through with Povember.  Well, that was a bust.  That was a bust.  Uh, all right.  Hey, I got to play this, uh, our own Butcher, uh, Butcher Ed Brock, right?  Yep.  Butcher Ed Brock came up with this, uh, some audio from the show and he decided to kind  of put it together.  All righty.  We should start a panty club.  I agree. 
[01:24:00]  A man's man panty club.  Who's with me?  Panty party!  Put it this way.  Tuesday is panty night.  I put them on one time in my life, uh, gross panties.  I've slipped them on before.  Or, let's say, uh, it's a drunken night, um, and you decide to put on your chick's  panties and prance around and, uh, uh, because it's funny.  That's kind of fun.  You put her panties on?  Well, the material is very nice.  Yeah.  You got to give it that.  You look good in them.  Did they fit?  My God.  It can't contain me. 
[01:24:30]  I'm such a man.  It can't contain me.  I'm bursting.  Did you put them on backwards or frontwards?  Yeah.  Okay.  I put the panties on and the bra.  And I marched around a house singing tra-la-la.  Make a promo.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  What happened now?  Make a promo.  And make a promo.  Yeah.  We'll be hearing that one.  And we are.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  I just have to say, why do I have to say that? 
[01:25:00]  Our panty party idea never took off.  I don't know why.  I don't know why that one.  Panty party!  I don't know why that one didn't take off.  I think I took a lot of heat that day.  Yeah.  And the fact that I wasn't really wearing panties to the extent that everybody was saying.  Ridiculous.  At the Sunday brunch, did a preacher go up or you just ate?  It wasn't like a sermon?  Yeah.  There was like a sermon thing going on and then a lot of singing and gospel singing.  It was mostly gospel music. 
[01:25:30]  Some nice coffee, some nice southern food, stand up, sit down, stand up, sit down, and some Bloody Marys.  Drinking.  Yeah.  Lawrence Fishburne walked in and got his payment.  It's amazing that you would even say yes to your mother-in-law and wife to do something like that.  To say, are you out of your mind?  Do you think I'm getting up Sunday morning and going to have a community breakfast? 
[01:26:00]  How could that possibly happen?  Do you think I could have said that?  Do you think I was in any position to say that?  Yeah.  Anthony was in hell.  God.  I couldn't say that.  That would have caused a problem that would have transcended going to the event.  See, that was the problem.  Anything.  Get the devil music.  Anthony's getting off.  Anything I do or did.  Anything.  If I didn't want to do it, the problem became larger than if I just did the thing in the 
[01:26:30]  first place.  So I was forced, compelled to go and do whatever I was told because not doing it made a larger  problem.  So you had two people coming at you.  You didn't have just your wife.  It was the one-two punch.  Wife-mother-in-law.  Wife-mother-in-law.  Wife-mother-in-law.  Wife-mother-in-law.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ow. 
[01:27:00]  Ow.  Oh.  Believe me.  And you just have to watch soap operas.  I had to watch soap operas.  After we were doing our, after we were done with our, our shock-chock radio show up there  in Boston, Ant had to pick up his wife at the time at his mother-in-law's house.  Oh.  But they weren't allowed to go home right away.  No.  They had to watch soap operas together.  Wife-mother-in-law.  Wife-mother-in-law.  Oh, wife-mother-in-law.  Wife-mother-in-law.  Oh. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  Oh.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  I, I got, uh, uh, back from, uh, from work.  And, um, I had to sit there and watch soap operas and friends in the mother-in-law's house.  You were an orphan.  It's a-  I was, no, I was, uh, uh, just a whipped, uh, uh, uh, uh, Mary who didn't stand up for  himself.  Days are over!  Over. 
[01:28:00]  Huh.  Because the hell that I would have to go through if I did not comply.  Compliance was mandatory.  Or else, you don't even know.  You don't want to go to brunch?  No, I'm-  But mother wants to go to brunch.  No, but-  All right.  I'll go to the goddamn brunch. 
[01:28:30]  So you're saying there's things that were even worse than that?  Yes, yes, yes.  Just anything, non-compliance, was worse than just doing it.  Just doing it would end.  See, the, the, the, uh, uh, uh, brunch?  At some point, the brunch ended.  And I got to leave.  If I didn't go, who knows how long that would last.  Weeks.  Just, it, I, I was not in a position where I, uh, could really make decisions. 
[01:29:00]  I need a harp.  Let's go back in time.  Oh.  To the gospel brunch at the House of Blues in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony's sitting there with his mother-in-law and his, uh, and his wife at the time.  Yeah.  Oh.  Right?  I want to go home. 
[01:29:30]  But you just got there.  We just got here.  Yes, but I want to go home.  I, okay, one more mimosa and then I'll go home.  Yeah, but I'm driving and we just got here and stuff.  Mom wants to go home.  Okay.  All right.  Let me finish up, uh, the Bloody Mary and we'll, no, I won't finish the Bloody Mary.  You're right.  You're right.  I will just leave.  We will just go home. 
[01:30:00]  We will drop off mother and then we'll come back.  Who cares?  It took us 40 minutes to get here and we've been sitting here for 15.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  He wants to go home.  Rich, you have no idea.  I live, I live alongside this man through this time.  When I flipped out, I was in the psych ward.  Dude, our favorite.  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Go ahead, go ahead, Rich.  No, I want to hear this.  Yours has got to be better.  No, no, not necessarily.  When I flipped out in the psych ward, I was like 21 and then, or 22, and then I came out 
[01:30:30]  and my friends go, he needs a trip to Florida.  So they drove, we drove all the way to Florida and I was on all kinds of like Thorazine and  Haldol and we get down there and I wake up, I go, I want to go home.  Oh, no.  Turn around, go back.  Yeah, I went through that a few times.  I got home.  I got home.  I went back and did the Thorazine stuff in the hospital.  All I do is do laps all day.  Oh, we're watching, we're watching Days of Our Lives. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, oh, ow, okay.  All right, I'll stay, I'll stay.  We're watching Days.  All right, Days of Our Lives is over.  Can we leave?  General Hospital, you taped it.  Oh, God.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, ow.  All right, all right, I'll stay for that.  I'll stay, I'll stay, I'll stay.  All right.  Wait.  Oh, go ahead, go ahead.  Friends?  Do you think when you're watching Friends, I could go, oh, no, okay, I'll go, ow, oh. 
[01:31:30]  But our house is a mile away.  Can't I just leave it?  No.  I'll stop it.  Okay, I'll stay, I'll stay.  And you got to add this to the equation, Aunt's wife at the time didn't drive, so Aunt had  no choice but to wait until she was ready.  So I had to wait with the car.  Until she was ready to go home from her mother-in-law's house, or her mother's.  I'd already done my stint over there at the radio station, and it wasn't like just doing 
[01:32:00]  the radio show and leaving.  We had hours of production afterwards that we used to have to do.  That's what you do, especially when you're first starting out like me.  You're a real go-getter, so I would do the production.  It would take me hours, but I enjoyed it.  Well, there was also the showering with the girls to make sure they were all clean after  they left the radio station.  Well, when girls have fudge all over them, and syrup, and baked beans, and creamed corn,  and there's a shower in the building, you do have to supervise the showers. 
[01:32:30]  Ow, oh, no.  No, I was doing production.  I found pictures of that, by the way.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was going through an old computer, and I found all the pictures of the bean parties.  Can you bring them in?  Yeah.  We were disgusting.  I'll put them on a disc.  We had hot girls come in, and we decided that...  We called it the Blue Tarp Cabaret. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, let's make it less hot by dumping beans all over their hotness.  We'd have them fight each other with food products.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  Take your clothes off and fight yourselves with food.  This is great.  Try this at home.  If you've got a really hot girlfriend, convince her to get naked in all her hotness, and then  pour as many beans as possible all over her body.  And watch how the hotness just kind of goes away.  The hotness leaves.  You've got to tell your audience not to cook the beans, because these guys will put on hot 
[01:33:30]  sweat.  Hot beans just throw it in their girl's face.  Hey, they told me to do this.  Dude, could you bring those pictures in?  That's great.  Yeah.  You've got to bring them in, and we'll throw them up on a website.  Matt on Long Island.  I've got hot beans.  Check this out.  Oh, wait a minute.  All right.  The hospital?  Hey, let's tell you how to Matt on Long Island.  Matt, what's up?  The power of life compels you.  The power of life compels you.  The power of life compels you.  Yeah.  When you got divorced, did she get involved, the mother-in-law? 
[01:34:00]  Like, was she...  No, no, not at all.  No, it was, you know, your basic things I can't talk about due to pending litigation.  I can tell you this much.  Anthony was cut out of the posters.  Yeah, yeah.  That was kind of funny.  We had our Demented World poster to go along with the CD, and it was framed and hung up  with pride in the mother-in-law's house.  She loved Opie.  Even though I broke all her stuff.  Broke all the stuff when you lived there for three years or whatever it was. 
[01:34:30]  Over a year, I think.  It was a while.  He lived with you, your wife?  No.  He lived with my mother-in-law.  Dude, we were shark jocks, and people had no idea.  I was living with Anne's mother-in-law.  I had my own room in her house upstairs because I was too lazy to find my own place.  I got out of there pronto.  My chick at the time decided she didn't want to move to Boston, so it took her forever  to get up there.  There was a point where it was me, the wife, the mother-in-law, and Opie living in a small  condo, and we would get calls every day. 
[01:35:00]  God, you guys are like, you're an amazing shark jock.  Oh, yeah.  Little did they know we were having dinner together at the ex-mother-in-law's house, drinking  a box of wine, kicking dogs under the table.  It's like Billy Idol living with you.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  It was, and then it got to a point where after a couple of weeks, like, I was like, okay,  we're leaving.  We're moving out.  So I moved to my wonderful apartment in Ashland, Mass., with the Brazilians and the chickens, 
[01:35:30]  which was fantastic.  And Opie stayed there.  Yeah.  He stayed at the mother-in-law's house.  It was my own place.  And you left debris at the house.  It was my own place, because she loved her box of wine to the point, by the time we got  home from our afternoon drive show, she was already in bed.  It was my, I had the run of the joint.  Well, no, she was downstairs watching soap operas.  Well, true.  And then she would go to bed when you would leave.  Was she married, the mother-in-law?  What?  Your wife's mother, was she married? 
[01:36:00]  No, she was divorced.  Divorced?  Yeah.  She was a nice lady.  I got no pride.  She really was.  I didn't have any problems with her.  She was a nice lady.  She was really nice.  I liked her.  It was cool.  Yeah.  She just had, you know, little quirks that everybody has.  And one of them was that she never made a left-hand turn in a car.  She made three rights.  No.  It's a famous life.  Three rights, make a left.  Dude.  We, ah.  We sat at Route 9 so many times.  We're so late.  Going like, I can't make a left-hand turn, because it's very dangerous. 
[01:36:30]  When we first moved up there, we had to fly out to LA, and we were living in Ashland.  And at Aunt's ex-mother-law's house, and she had to drive us to the airport, but she doesn't  take left-hand turns.  So it took us a couple hours to get to Logan.  She actually drove us to the bus.  Oh, we didn't even get to the...  Oh, it took us over an hour to...  Logan Express.  Okay.  All right.  I forgot.  Yeah.  It took us over an hour to go from...  This is very local, I understand.  Uh, to go from Ashland to Natick, Route 9, the bus stop there that takes... 
[01:37:00]  One town away.  ...to take you to Logan Airport.  It took us months later, when we started getting familiar with the area, we're like,  oh my god, Aunt, do you realize how close that bus is?  That's where we were?  That bus stop is?  It's a five-minute drive.  It's a five-minute drive.  It took over an hour, because she doesn't take lefts.  So we were in all these back country roads, because she had to make a huge right-hand circle.  All she had to do was take a left, go up a country road, I forgot all the roads right 
[01:37:30]  now, hit Route 9, take another right, but then you would have to take a left into the  parking lot of the bus area there.  That wasn't good either.  That was tricky.  So she made right-hand turns, so it was a massive, huge circle, until she figured out  that she could make a right right into the bus stop as well.  Oh, I see, because if you've got to go left, and you can only make rights, you basically  have to go around the world to get where you're going.  Yeah, it's pretty much it.  She went around the globe. 
[01:38:00]  Here's what I see.  You make the right, but like you said, if you make a big right circle-  That's what I'm saying.  That's what she would do.  This is not a joke.  Well, it's kind of funny, but it's not a joke.  Well, it's funny when you're in the car.  It's funny now.  Right, right.  If you guys are going to Wisecrackers in Scranton this weekend, you've got to make  a left turn.  Yeah, at some point, you'll have to make a left.  That's where you'll see Rich.  And run over Rich if you see him in the road.  We're babbling.  The phones are lit.  That's crazy.  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:30]  Some great phone calls.  All right, stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Anthony, Rich Voss.  Hi.  Rich will be at Wisecrackers in Scranton, Pennsylvania this weekend, Friday and Saturday.  I have a little postscript, a little P.S.  to a subject we were talking about yesterday.  You know, my home defense.  A lot of people were commenting on that, by the way.  I got a lot of kudos from a lot of police officers. 
[01:39:00]  That said, my idea of home defense and having guns in the house and an alarm system and a  game plan if something happens, like a home invasion, is a smart thing to do.  So you're not being a victim.  You're not going to end up a victim with a phone cord wrapped around your neck, watching  your family ravaged as you go, oh, I wish I would have had a gun or something.  And I was being called crazy. 
[01:39:30]  I might have said, I listened to the replay and I, you know, kind of taking myself out  of it and listening, I did sound a bit crazy.  I would call it kooky.  But no, no.  I understood everything I was saying.  I still agree with myself.  So, the thing is, my brother called me up and then reminded me of something that kind of  tells me where this came from.  Oh, no.  The old man.  Yeah, of course.  It comes from my father, who had guns everywhere, apparently. 
[01:40:00]  And my brother reminded me of one time where my brother went out to California.  That's where my father was living.  Drives up to my father's place and had to yell from behind a tree, not, Dad, it's me.  It's me.  Because my father was at the front door, like in his underwear, with a .357 Magnum, pointing  it.  Did he ever get mail? 
[01:40:30]  Because it was, you know, it was nighttime, I guess.  And he was ready to shoot my brother, who was behind a tree, taking cover, going, Dad,  Dad, it's Joe, your son.  Was he just coming home late?  No, Joe was dropping in.  But he didn't live there.  He lived in New York.  He was, like, coming up to visit.  And I guess it was a surprise visit.  And, you know, you get a gun pulled on you.  What are you going to do? 
[01:41:00]  But that isn't the only thing.  I also recall a story from the 80s at some point, and it was in the newspaper back then  in San Juan Capistrano.  That's where he lived.  Apparently, there was this crime spree going on, and he had guns everywhere, like in the  kitchen, in the bathroom.  So anywhere he was in his place, he was within arm's reach of a gun.  And one night, a gentleman was prowling about, and Dad went outside with his 357 and held 
[01:41:30]  the guy there on the ground until the police arrived.  And when my brother was telling me this story, I was like, I could just imagine the guy on  the ground thinking, what's worse?  Being here with this guy holding a gun to me or the police coming.  The guy was probably wanting the police to come so bad, because I know what my father 
[01:42:00]  was probably saying.  The gentleman was an African-American laying on the ground.  And knowing my pop over the years, I could just imagine the verbal torture this man endured  laying there as my father pointed a gun at him waiting for the police to show up.  Giving him choices.  Oh, my God.  Perhaps you can get up and try to run.  You know what?  He went on the ground and he had spray paint a target being put on his back. 
[01:42:30]  Exactly.  Like, you picked the wrong effing house.  A gun in every room?  Yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't it be a good security system?  You wouldn't need a gun in every room?  He's got all that.  The security system.  Well, me, I have, you know, I have a security system.  Ant's got it all.  My father didn't.  He didn't care.  He'd rather shoot somebody.  Okay, say they cross your moat.  Say they get over the moat.  Uh-huh.  Through the security system.  Over the bob wire.  Yeah, we talked about it yesterday.  I would just open fire.  Yeah, he's got many levels.  Let's say-  Someone comes in the house, they're getting shot. 
[01:43:00]  Speaking of things we did yesterday, Anthony, we got Annie back from Queens.  Ooh.  Annie's, what, 42, Annie?  I'm not going to tell you my age.  Oh, boy.  Didn't you tell us yesterday, or am I getting you mixed up with somebody else?  Well, I lied.  Sorry.  Yeah, you did sound a bit older than 40-something.  No, I'm in my 40s.  When you graduated high school.  Annie-  I'm in my mid-40s.  I like this Annie woman.  She's a dreamer.  She believes that she can find-  I'm not a dreamer.  She believes she can find somebody-  Oh, now- 
[01:43:30]  I change diapers every day, okay?  I'm not-  I remember what she does now.  She talks over everybody.  Yeah, she does talk over everybody.  You change diapers for a living?  Apparently, yeah.  It has become that.  See, we'd like to kind of let-  Oh, my God.  We'd like to let the listeners in on who you are, because it's kind of a new audience from yesterday,  so maybe Ope can kind of fill them in.  Okay, I'll do it.  I'll do it.  But you need to shut up while he does that.  Right.  She's a dreamer, Rich.  She wants to be married and in love and have a very healthy relationship.  She hasn't been able to find that, so she has never been married. 
[01:44:00]  But she's trying to find her man online, and she's had over 50 dates in the last year alone.  Yesterday, she told us that a 70-year-old married guy was hitting on her online at night, and now she's back today.  Right, Annie?  Right.  So what do we got?  Well, I wanted to get your opinion.  I spied on someone on the Internet, and I found out that he's gay and-  I'm not gay.  He's, well, apparently bisexual. 
[01:44:30]  I spied on him because he wanted to take me out, and he was, like, pressuring me for intimacy.  Excuse me.  And I was, I wanted to know who this guy was, you know?  And he, you know, in AOL, when you highlight someone's screen name, you see the chat room.  Oh, come on.  Stop with the music and the drum.  AOL, go ahead.  Something that most people haven't used in five years.  This is, like, freaking me out.  This music is freaking me out.  All right, go ahead, Annie.  Okay.  When you highlight someone's screen name, hello, ladies. 
[01:45:00]  You can listen to this and smile on these guys and see which chat room they're in, if they're gay or not.  Okay, when you highlight someone's screen name, you can see which chat room they're in.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  So, I accidentally one day, my cursor was on his screen name.  No, no, no.  Accidentally.  Let's be honest.  Oops.  It wasn't accidentally.  Of course you did.  Of course.  Who do you think you're talking to?  You're a snooper.  No, no, no. 
[01:45:30]  You're one of those snoopers.  No, let me explain.  But wait a second.  How can the music freak you out?  You went on 50 dates.  I didn't know.  So, initially, oh, come on.  Don't crack on me, okay?  I have my own show, too.  Oh, yeah?  And I was going to invite you on my show.  It's the Anthony Spano show.  And my name, Anthony, Annie is, I told you real quick, my name is Anthony.  Are you blonde?  Of course.  No.  Well, I used to be.  You need like a little crash course to pronounce my...  You know, today was the day I was thinking we were going to have one of those perfect radio  shows.  The perfect show.  We were almost there. 
[01:46:00]  And that's why we weren't going to talk about it.  No one was talking about the perfect show.  Right.  Yeah, so it's not to jinx it.  Now we have to acknowledge that...  Once again, we're going to fall short of the perfect radio show.  We missed the perfect radio show.  Everyone down the hall today, oh, my God, you guys sound great today.  There's a natural chemistry.  But no one was going to say that we were having a perfect show because you don't want to jinx it.  We were all feeling it, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, today's the day where we go, wow, not one bad break.  During commercial breaks, no one would talk to us.  We'd sit there, elbow in the ice. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  Just kind of sitting it out and waiting.  And then what happens?  We give up a bloop Annie.  Yeah, it wasn't even like in a home run or nothing.  No, no.  It was just a bloop Annie.  We could have easily fielded this ball, but right over the short's head.  We got lazy.  We got lazy.  We did.  I could have been involved in a perfect radio day.  Yes, you could have.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yep.  Yes, you could have.  My show is public access.  It's the Anthony Stano show. 
[01:47:00]  And all of Queens will see what you guys look like.  Yeah, everybody.  I think a lot of people know what we look like already because we've been on national TV, Annie.  Annie, are you a hottie?  Tell the truth.  Are you hot looking?  I used to be.  Actually, I used to be with a modeling agency in Greece.  I know.  You said that.  Annie, I think your time for the show is over.  It's an old model company.  Let me tell you about this guy.  All right.  So you snooped on the guy.  You snooped on the guy.  You saw him in a gay chat room.  That's a dumb joke.  How did you not quit?  No.  Excuse me. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  Wow.  We don't even have a one-hitter anymore.  We've got to just hang in there for a win.  We've got to hang in there for a W at this point.  Because even a one-hitter is pretty impressive.  Thanks for calling in, Bush.  At the end of your career, you could say, hey, I had three one-hitters.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Now we're in trouble of losing this game.  What happened?  Answer the question.  Was what I did wrong?  I don't think you should be snooping, but whatever. 
[01:48:00]  So, all right.  He was in a...  I found out that this guy's having unprotected sex with men.  Uh-huh.  He wants...  Apparently, I mean, he was trying to bed me.  And I find this out.  Was it wrong that I was...  You know, I spied.  Are you insane?  Of course it's not wrong.  You should just spy on him as much as you want if you're thinking of bedding him, as you say.  Bedding him.  And if he's having unprotected sex with men, perhaps you ought to really think about it.  Yeah.  I guess it's... 
[01:48:30]  That's what it is.  In the end, it's good that you found out.  Great.  Well, I agree.  Well, have a great day.  And maybe...  How about...  Annie.  How about you stop trying to find, like, your husband online?  Yeah.  And you're not even doing, like, the way most people are doing through, like, Match.com and all these dating sites.  You're going into the world of AOL to try to find your husband.  Craigslist.  I'd like to thank Craig.  I think he's great.  I love Craigslist.  It's wonderful.  Oh, Jesus.  All I know about Craigslist is what Jimmy used to get off of there. 
[01:49:00]  Craigslist sounds like a dangerous place, too, according to Jimmy.  No, actually...  How about you go to Match.com?  How about you go to a coffee?  How about you go to a coffee shop?  How about you join a bowling league?  You sound like a bowling league broad.  Join a bowling league.  Your 64th date cuts your tongue out.  How about that?  And those bowling shirts cover up a world of hurt.  It's perfect for you.  Perfect, I say.  How much do you get?  Do you make a lot of money with your internet radio show?  Or do you do it as a hobby?  No, no money.  All right, Annie. 
[01:49:30]  Well, all right.  So you're still on the hunt.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  On the hunt?  Yeah.  Yeah, we said hunt.  Rob, Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, earlier when you guys were talking about Anthony's fortress in the middle of Israel,  I heard boss say bobwire, and I just wanted to know what Bob's wire looks like.  Yeah.  What is a bobwire?  Bobwire.  Okay, so you know what?  Listen, here's the thing.  We were having a no-hitter, and when it fell apart, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry.  I was rattled.  Everyone got rattled and bobbled the ball, and we just... 
[01:50:00]  We stunk.  Oh, my God.  We just let her run in.  What is going on here?  Barbed wire, right?  Barbed?  Barbed.  Barbed wire, yes.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  Barbed wire.  Hey, we got this little story coming in today.  Hey, do we have any more presidential hackery today?  Let's see.  What's...  When the president jogs around the White House, that's presidential hackery.  Oh, the jog.  Well, any jog that he takes with the Secret Service is hackery.  When he drives through Dallas just to get his head blown off, it's hackery. 
[01:50:30]  That's such hack.  It's hack.  His wife is picking his brains off of the trunk.  No big deal.  We've seen it.  Presidential hackery signing a bill with 100 pens.  Yeah.  You see that?  Where the pens switch, the pens switch, the pens switch.  Having the meeting with that guy from another country where they just sit in those chairs  awkwardly far away from each other with a small little table in between them.  And just nod at each other because they don't speak each other's language.  Yeah, yeah.  Or standing next to the opposing party, like when Bush was with Gore, but pretending they 
[01:51:00]  like each other.  Yeah.  And they're completely hackery.  Yeah.  They're calling Annie the cooler.  Steve from Bayshore is calling Annie the cooler.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  They brought her in.  We were on a streak.  Annie's the cooler.  What happened?  Just to push her into the bathroom.  Yeah, you mush.  And finish.  She's a mush.  I know.  Had a big pile of chips.  I know.  She calls.  Gets done.  What happened?  Looks like she touches your arm when you're shooting craps.  Thank you.  Thank you for touching my arm.  Seven out. 
[01:51:30]  Let me tell you how bad Annie is.  The phones have gone dead.  We got here at what?  We came in studio around 550.  Every phone was lit and ready to go.  Ready to go.  They know they can participate.  Give and take.  Boom, boom, boom.  Right?  The phones have been lit the entire time until right now.  Until Annie.  Black Monday.  This is like they're jumping out of their windows now.  Thank you, Annie.  Black Friday.  Oh, Friday.  I said Monday.  I was four days early. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Another run was just lit in.  We're going to the ninth inning.  Let's hang in there.  Oh, no.  We just need three outs now.  It's going to be a hell of an upset.  No.  The no hitter is a distant memory at this point.  The one hitter is completely gone.  We don't even have a shutout at this point.  Let's go to the bullpen.  Now we're using up all our available pitchers just to try to get a win.  Oh, my God.  We're running out of pitchers.  The second baseman is going to come out of the dugout.  Attempt to pitch.  Great.  I love that old gag. 
[01:52:30]  I love that old gag.  Oh, yeah.  Can they do that?  Run out of pitchers, so like the second baseman.  Hey, pitched in college.  Right, right.  All of a sudden, he's hitting somebody in the stands.  Great.  Wonderful.  We got this.  It's quick.  I'm a blonde, and tonight there's a new report out about us fair-haired ladies.  And, no, it's not that we have more fun.  It's that we actually make men act dumb.  I read all about this, Martha.  Researchers found that if a man is shown an image of a blonde woman, scores on general knowledge test drop. 
[01:53:00]  They say blondes have the potential to make people act in a dumber way because those people mimic the unconscious stereotype of the dumb blonde.  Dumb blonde.  The dumb.  No, I think your attention gets drawn away from what you're trying to think about as you look at the blonde.  It's ridiculous because I could be dumb without a blonde in front of me.  It doesn't need a...  That's true.  Maybe that's the problem. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, he's looking at you the whole time.  He sees a blonde, and he's retarded on the show.  Thank God he didn't marry a blonde.  She was at one point.  Yeah.  Married.  How's that working out?  You don't like the marriage?  Oh, it's great.  No, yeah.  You just wear it.  Oh, boy.  Whoa.  You have no idea what you just did.  Oh, married.  Oh, married.  I was just talking about the whole marriage.  No, no, she's cool, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, things are great.  Oh, boy. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, boy.  Let's say hi to Paul in Jersey.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Because it's all about the kid and not you anymore.  Oh, boy.  Right?  Well, yeah, I guess so.  But you know that.  You were married before with kids.  So, you know, it turns into not about Bonnie and Rich.  It's about Bonnie and the baby.  And Rich is the guy that makes the money.  Yeah, but if the baby's the last time you use certain parts of your...  Well, whatever.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:54:30]  Oh.  Let's say hi to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Hey.  Hey.  I think that Annie chick is making me linger less.  Linger lesser.  Linger lesser.  I want to say hi to all my linger longerers out there today.  Let's go to Annie in Queens.  Annie.  What?  I'm back.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Could you not be back?  You said your phone lines were...  I wanted to help you.  You said your phone lines were not...  You're not...  Don't you understand what you did? 
[01:55:00]  No.  Well, I'd like to interview you on my show.  About...  You don't have a show.  About what?  I have a show.  I have a show on public access.  Public access?  Yes.  That's why I'm not making the money you're making.  No, we're not talking...  How much are you making?  Because I'd like to one day make some money.  It's not about what anyone is making.  It's about...  You're like...  You're doing what Sandy Cain does.  No, no.  I'm going to get advertisers.  You know?  Uh-huh.  People maybe Viagra.  No, I'll tell you exactly who I'm going to get. 
[01:55:30]  Copaxone.  Because I have multiple sclerosis and I inject myself...  Oh.  You got MS, then.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Wait a minute.  Annie, what?  Yes, it's true.  Wait, wait, wait.  What are you...  Hold on!  Hold on!  What is wrong with you?  Multiple sclerosis.  That's why you can't find a husband. 
[01:56:00]  Nobody wants to build a ramp.  I really...  Can you get around?  Of course.  Of course I get around.  No, no.  I mean, do you need assistance?  There's a show over there.  I get around.  Do you need assistance?  Crutches?  Wheelchair?  She doesn't.  Obviously, it didn't affect her mouth.  Yeah.  Can you think of one person I was playing that says, hey, let's get home so we can listen  to Annie on public access?  I couldn't even imagine what person would ever... 
[01:56:30]  My name is not Annie.  Whatever your name is.  Whatever it is.  I couldn't even...  That's not the alias.  Just nobody could possibly go, hey, you've got to hear her on public access.  Let's just spell out my name first.  A-N-T-H-I.  T like in Tom, H-I.  I'm C-Spanos.  Oh, Annie?  All right.  What are you talking about on your show?  I have to give you a lesson how to say my name.  That's why I say Annie.  What do you talk about on your show?  And please send us a copy.  Okay.  The first two shows were about drunk drivers, and I basically yell at them. 
[01:57:00]  I tell them that they're losers.  Why?  Why?  Please don't tell me you're a Jew.  You know, some people are pretty good at drunk driving.  There.  And D, whatever your name is.  That's good.  I'm C.  I'm C.  That's good.  People are going to listen to a radio show where they're lectured at.  Yeah, where they yelled at.  Where they're yelled at.  Nice.  Don't drive drunk.  For their foibles.  The word of the day is foibles.  Well, I did stand-up.  I mean, I did stand-up.  Did you?  How do you do stand-up?  That's funny, you know? 
[01:57:30]  How long did that clear last?  You do hunch over.  The next show is going to be a bad.  Hunch over comedy.  That's weird, because nowadays you do sit down.  Oh, stop.  That's so mean.  And the next...  We've got to take a break.  We're getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the opening at the end.  Did we have anything on the blonde thing?  That was just dumb, right?  Yeah.  One of the dumb news stories.  Yeah.  We're done with that one.  Hey, we're getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show? 
[01:58:00]  It's like college today.  Yeah.  Wasn't it?  Just an educational show.  Brendan in New York, he picked up on something Rich said before the break.  Yes, Brendan.  We're going to start with you.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Brendan.  Dude, I just want to say one thing.  I learned a lot, and I never, ever date someone with MS, because I can't even build a birdhouse.  How the hell am I supposed to build a ramp?  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, I walked out of the studio during the break, and Tim goes, you guys didn't acknowledge 
[01:58:30]  Richard's great line.  And what was the line about, nobody wants to build a ramp.  Yeah.  And then we went off during the break.  I'm like, you know, who wants a ramp outside their house?  It brings down the value of your home.  It's just that eyesore.  That ramp is an eyesore.  An eyesore.  That could take a castle and turn it into a trailer.  Most people can't, like, maintain a deck and make it look nice. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  You know, you've got to stain it all the time and make it look nice.  Those ramps just always look all rickety.  They're a bit of an eyesore.  An eyesore for the neighborhood.  They always painted gray.  How come they never painted them a cheerful...  Paint them festive.  Yeah.  I'm rolling my wheelchair up this festive ramp.  And then you go out and buy Christmas lights, and you've got to get extra lights because  of the ramp.  Decorate the ramp.  Decorate the ramp.  Decorate the ramp.  Like, you know, before Grandpa moved in, you're only spending, like, 50 on lights.  Now you've got to spend 52 because of Grandpa and his inconvenience. 
[01:59:30]  Thanks, Grandpa.  You're going to chip in for the lights this year.  The ramp.  The ramp.  I think we're blowing up in Carolina.  We get a lot of calls from Carolina every day.  Mark, what's up?  Welcome.  Oh, yes.  I just wanted to let you guys know what I learned today, that having Rich Voss by your side and  Annie with her 50 days and her multiple sclerosis that she's overcome.  Shut up.  I didn't get it.  Linger Linger. 
[02:00:00]  That's a Jimmy bit.  What part of Carolina are you guys in?  All of.  All of Carolina?  Yeah.  Yes.  Cool.  Both.  Love Carolina.  South and North.  Cool.  What about East and West Carolina?  Yeah, but East and West don't get the acknowledgement they deserve.  They really don't.  It's all about the North and the South.  You barely ever hear of East Carolina.  I want to know what West Carolina's all about.  I hear it's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was working in a club in Charlotte.  I worked there once and he won't be able to be back.  He said, well, he's too New York. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, really?  That means too Jew is what that really means.  Wasn't Seinfeld and Sopranos a little New York, the biggest shows on TV?  No.  Sopranos was Jersey.  You're comparing yourself to the Sopranos and Seinfeld.  No, I'm saying those.  Sopranos, Seinfeld, and Voss.  And Voss.  Thank God.  You know something?  That's wonderful.  Sometimes the obvious just goes right over my head.  Thank God you pointed that out.  He actually compared himself to Seinfeld and the Sopranos, two of the most popular TV shows 
[02:01:00]  in history.  And Jerry Seinfeld.  And Rich Voss.  Jerry Seinfeld is making movies.  You're at Wisecrackers.  That was a very good observation on your part, I'm thinking.  This is where you guys are.  Yeah.  Those shows were both tens on a one to ten scale, right?  Yeah.  As a stand-up, I know I'm a ten.  But did I ever tell you?  Seinfeld wasn't successful because it was a New York show.  Hi, Bonnie.  Let me buzz you up.  Right. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, here comes, it's Norton.  Yeah, it was.  Hello, Bob Kelly.  It took place in New York City, but it was successful because so many people from all  over the country could relate to the show and the things they were talking about.  I don't want to look like a pirate.  All I was trying to do was trash the club in Charlotte. 
[02:02:00]  I won't rehire me.  Thank you.  You have to have a reason not to rehire me because I'm delusional.  That's sign, boss.  Wow.  Oh, and now we've missed it.  Oh, well, whatever.  It's fine.  We had a good phone call.  All right.  Let's say hi to Charles in Jersey.  It happens.  Charles, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  I learned that when you have a horse like Danny, you should take her out back and shoot  her.  There you go.  Let's go to Al in Jersey.  Al.  Al.  Al.  What do you say, Al?  We missed Al. 
[02:02:30]  How's that Boomer show working out for you?  Al.  Al.  How's Boomer?  Tell Boomer we said hi, Al.  Did he punch you yet, Al?  Al.  All right, Al.  Hi.  I learned today that Anthony should be my own protection system in my house because he'll  just take down an army.  That's it.  There you go.  Shoot first.  All right.  Let's go to Carl in Westchester.  We don't know much about this Westchester area.  What's up, Carl?  Hey, guys.  I learned that one of the symptoms of MS is a snotty, congested, awful voice. 
[02:03:00]  That won't shut up, apparently.  There you go.  Let's go to Rich in Bohemia.  Rich.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Today I learned that a perfect game can be ruined by a bunt.  A bunt.  That's very good.  And a, as well.  Let's go to Josh in Minnesota.  Josh?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  You do any Fargo? 
[02:03:30]  What's that?  You do any Fargo?  No, I'm from southern Minnesota.  He's in Minnesota.  Minnesota.  I know, but it's close enough.  Yeah, it is.  You can hear a little Fargo in his voice.  You hear it, right, Al?  Oh, of course I do.  Down by the lake.  It's going crazy down by the lake.  So I figured I'd phone it in.  So I did.  End of story.  You don't do one Fargo line, Josh? 
[02:04:00]  No.  All right.  What do you got for the show?  I learned that...  Babe, the blue ox.  I love that line.  What about that creep that was trying to pick her up when she was pregnant, man?  Oh, you're such a nice lady.  Yeah.  Josh, go ahead.  Okay, I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.  Well, how do you know? 
[02:04:30]  Okay, Margie.  Okay.  Hey, hey, I'm cooperating here.  I'm cooperating here.  I love that.  You see William Mason.  Oh, William Mason.  He's like, yeah, and he's pained.  It's just, oh, oh, oh.  I'm cooperating here. 
[02:05:00]  Okay, okay, I'll count on myself.  And he's like, yeah, just a minute.  When the cocks are in, he's crawling out the window in his underwear.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, what the heck do you mean?  It's my deal, Wade.  Yeah, these are some sweet numbers.  Yeah, but it's my deal.  What kind of finder's fee you're looking for?  Finder's fee?  I love when he goes home. 
[02:05:30]  When he's downstairs and his kid is calling.  With the dead father-in-law's in his trunk outside.  Right.  And his kid goes, Dad, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I think I'll go to bed.  One of the greatest characters ever.  Ever.  That's classic.  He's just in a world of trouble.  And his kid is just yelling for him.  Hey, Dad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be right up.  It's so hard. 
[02:06:00]  Did you ever get him to murder someone?  You're going to call Dan Grossman?  No, I think I'm going to go to bed.  So you're married, old son of a Gunderson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where were we?  Yeah.  Oh, yes, Dan.  Dan wants in.  Just one little detail about the son is when he's all depressed on his bed.  Oh, yeah.  And his accordion is sitting next to him on the bed. 
[02:06:30]  He's got his accordion.  And then his hero, the accordion king, on the back of his door, the poster.  And with that, we lost our Minnesota caller.  Oh, damn.  Our Minnesota friend.  I'm sorry.  Hey, man.  I'm cooperating here.  Cooperating.  His face was so pained.  Oh, they got me.  What about Buscemi with the taking care of it here in Brainerd?  Yeah, we could take care of it right here in Brainerd. 
[02:07:00]  Right here in Brainerd.  I figured we'd take care of it right here in Brainerd.  I got shot in the face.  I'm taking the car.  One of my top ten right there, man.  I've told this a couple times in the last month or so, Rich, but I showed Lindsay that  movie for the first time.  She never saw Fargo.  And I said, oh, it's a comedy, man.  You're going to love this.  And halfway through, she goes, I thought you told me this was a comedy. 
[02:07:30]  And I wasn't going to back down.  I'm like, it is.  Do you understand why this is a comedy?  When Buscemi's with a hook or two, and she's just gone, oh, yeah.  What do you got for me?  What do you got?  With that awful Minnesota accent.  What do you got?  Oh, my God.  I think the part where she goes, I thought it was a comedy, when, like, is it Buscemi  walks around the side of the house, right?  And his friend there is like, put him in a wood.  No, no, it's Margie walks around. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, Margie, that's right.  You're right.  You're right.  And the leg is sticking out of the wood chipper, and he's just jamming it in, and there's  just blood mist all over the floor.  Wait a minute.  This is a comedy?  I'm like, yes.  It's hysterical.  Look, there's a little sock on the foot.  I could talk comedy.  She points to her badge on her hat.  Right.  There are movies I find hilarious that aren't supposed to be hilarious.  The other one is about Schmidt.  We talk about that one from time to time.  Oh, yeah.  That made me laugh so...  I got yelled at a movie theater and a ton of dirty looks, because I would go to the 
[02:08:30]  movies during the day with all the old Bettys and stuff, and I thought that movie was hilarious,  and I couldn't help it.  I had to openly laugh in a theater.  I rarely do that.  And people got so mad at me.  That same thing happened to me at Schindler's List when the kids were crawling out of the  toilets.  Right.  I just started cracking up.  That's hilarious.  The mistake...  The mistake they made...  I had a soda thrown at me watching Titanic.  I was laughing as the people hit the propeller.  The propeller.  That's E-Rock?  Yeah.  That's not nice. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, girl jumped up and threw her Sprite right at my chest.  Get out of here.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Well, it was about Schmidt.  I mean, it's just one horrific thing after another after another after.  Then he's on the road, and they set up the scene by saying that he stopped by his boyhood  home.  And I just started laughing, because I know that it can't be good.  And then when it turned out to be a tire store, and he's trying to figure out where  his bedroom was.  He's walking in the tire store like, yeah, I think this was my bedroom.  I think this is where...  And there's just radials on display. 
[02:09:30]  That's the point of the movie where I couldn't take it anymore.  I was openly laughing.  Like, this is hilarious how ridiculous this is.  We get it.  The guy is in a horrible spot in his life.  Rob Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, I learned that if Michelangelo was a homo, he would have spent 10 years on his  stomach.  Painting the floor.  That was great.  Tim wants to use that in our promo today.  That's a good one.  But that ain't happening. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, no.  That's too bad, because that was...  Yeah, that was a good one.  That was a good one.  Cooperating.  Cooperating here.  He's also great in The Cooler.  And Boogie Nights, he was great in that.  But you've seen The Cooler, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Because he plays kind of the same type of pathetic role, man.  Always.  Where he was just used by everybody in the movie.  Same with the movie where he played like a retarded guy.  He's going door to door. 
[02:10:30]  I don't remember that one.  Wait, wait, wait.  When Alec Baldwin punches the pregnant chick in The Cooler, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that is hilarious.  E-Rock is pointing out another hilarious scene.  Did you laugh at that one, too?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  The Cooler is such an underrated movie, man.  That movie was really good.  Alec Baldwin was amazing in it.  Yeah.  He was amazing in it.  William H. Macy, yeah.  William H. Macy was amazing in it.  And a lot of people, we do it every time. 
[02:11:00]  Fargo, Minnesota.  Oh, but just the pregnant.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what we just...  Yeah, okay.  I didn't hear it, but I read it.  Sorry, I listened to the replay.  Oh, no worries.  No worries.  People get confused.  Someone on Instagram feedback.  Fargo, Minnesota or North Dakota?  To us, it's close enough and gets us going with the Fargo crap.  It's just anyone with the accent.  Right.  Which is the, you know...  It's close enough to sound like you're in Fargo.  Yeah.  That's all we're getting at.  It's close enough to the Blue Ox.  I heard the Blue... 
[02:11:30]  Babe, the Blue Ox.  I heard the Blue Ox went down last week or something.  Really?  Like the thing broke or something.  Oh, no.  I have to fix that.  All right.  I guess we're out of here, huh?  Oh, Rich.  I'm sorry.  Get your plug in.  Weiss Crackers.  Weiss Crackers.  Friday, Saturday, Saturday.  And also, this Thursday at Mighty Joe Young's in Westchester, White Plains.  Mighty Joe Young's.  Where's that?  Thursday.  I think it's in Westchester somewhere.  Mighty Joe Young's.  And then Friday, Saturday, Scranton, PA.  Rich is hilarious. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  Make sure you check out Rich Voss if you haven't yet.  All right.  Cool.  All right, guys.  We're off to XM.  Have a great day.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  We're off to XM. 
[02:12:30]  We're off to XM.

[02:13:30]  We're off to XM. 
[02:14:00]  We're off to XM. 
[02:14:30]  We're off to XM. 
[02:15:00]  We're off to XM.  We're off to XM.  We're off to XM.  And here we are, XM Satellite Radio, ready to broadcast. 
[02:15:30]  Wow, that was, my headphones were up to 11.  Time to get dirty, dirty, dirty.  You dirty boys.  What were you guys talking about as I was walking in?  The guys had me laughing, Van and Travis.  Trading little stories about when you say the wrong thing on the phone. 
[02:16:00]  Like, this usually happens when you're younger, when you're in your early teens or maybe 12 or something like that.  And you're talking to, let's say you're talking to your father.  And you say, alright, baby.  Because you're just talking to your little girlfriend.  And you call her baby.  I was 26.  This was like a month ago.  I got out of here.  So you said, I love you, baby, to your dad. 
[02:16:30]  And then I quickly covered it up.  I was like, daddy, baby daddy.  Baby daddy-o.  And then I had fun with his friend.  Yeah, when I was like 12 or something, I was making plans with my buddy.  I was like, alright, so I'll see you tomorrow then.  And he's like, alright, cool, love you.  Did you call him out on it?  Yeah, I was like, you what?  Yeah, you what?  He's like, I thought you were my mom.  Which, I don't know what that says about me, but that is really bad, yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Such a commitment.  Embarrassing.  I remember as a kid, a couple times, in like the department store in Macy's, when you're  little and you're with your mommy, and you just, you think you're walking next to your  mom, and you reach up and hold her hand, and it's somebody else, and you just, I used  to freak out, and of course start crying like the big baby that I was.  But I grabbed like a stranger's hand, and a lot of times they'd be like, hey, what are  you doing?  And at other times they'd say, whoa, this is my lucky day. 
[02:17:30]  I got an 80 pounder.  We were in a Dunkin' Donuts, and a song came on, and Bonnie thought I was next to her, and  she leaned her head on some stranger's shoulder and started singing it, thinking it was me.  To some guy next to her, and she was so uncomfortable.  Well, that's embarrassing, and when you give the wave to someone, you think it's someone  you know, and it's not, and then you got to cover up by like scratching your head.  It's just so embarrassing, man.  Or somebody waves to somebody else, and you think it's you. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, you think it's you, and you wave back, and then the other person comes from behind  and he goes, hi, how you doing?  And then you got to walk past them like you were waving to somebody else behind them.  You thought you had a friend.  Yeah.  No, but I got you all beat.  The famous walking out of Shea Stadium holding Danny's hand.  Well, that was a...  Nothing beats that story.  That was a put up, a joke on you.  We're just talking about like circumstances that just happened, and you're embarrassed.  That one was bad.  Yeah.  But I mean... 
[02:18:30]  We had box seats for the Mets game, because I don't think Rich has heard this story.  And I went with Lindsey and Danny.  I had four tickets, and so I got, you know, we still have an extra one, whatever.  But Danny's a huge Mets fan, so we go.  Have a good time.  We want to beat the traffic out, whatever.  And I start walking all the way up to the exit, a long walk.  And I reach behind me, and I have eye contact, and I grab Lindsey's hand, feeling real good  about myself, my new chick.  I'm in love.  Here I am, walking out, getting recognized, waving.  Hey, hey. 
[02:19:00]  Somewhere along the way, they did the old switcheroo.  This is why I love my chick, by the way.  And she let go of my hand, and Danny grabbed onto my hand.  And then she backed way up.  So now it's like...  Well, it didn't look like it was.  It was.  I was walking out of Shea Stadium, waving and acknowledging fans as I'm holding Danny's  hand behind me.  And I'm playing it up, too.  As I'm holding his hand, I'm just kind of making that, you know, that face.  Looking all coy. 
[02:19:30]  You know, just like looking around at people, like, you know.  Oh, that's horrible.  A little girl in a relationship.  Well, Lindsey, to this day, goes, you didn't notice the calluses on his hands?  How do you not notice, like, Lindsey's hand as opposed to Danny's hand?  I guess you don't have...  I have nice hands.  I'm not saying you plow fields every day or anything, but, I mean, the difference between  Lindsey's hand and your hand has to be noticeable.  Very girlish.  And then we got to the exit.  You know, now you're out of the stadium, for the most part.  As far as people checking, you know, checking you out or whatever. 
[02:20:00]  And I turn around, and they're laughing hysterically.  I'm like, no.  How long?  How long was this like this?  And I'm like, and then it hit me.  I'm like, oh, my God.  I know it's different, I guess, than what you guys are talking about.  But they are bringing it up like crazy on the instant feedback there.  Yeah, I made it to the parking lot of our local grocery store as a four-year-old, thinking  I was with my mom.  And that was the longest 50 feet when I had to look back. 
[02:20:30]  It was like one of those old Hitchcock's like, ah, thanks.  Yeah, they do the pole.  Your mom's driving away laughing.  Probably.  Probably.  You don't know mother, do you?  No.  I freaked my mom out once because we went shopping, and I was really little.  This is like one of my first memories.  I think I was like five or something.  And she bought me one of those balsa wood little airplanes that you put together with  the rubber band.  And I wanted to play with it so bad that I took it out of the shopping cart and just 
[02:21:00]  walked out of the supermarket and started walking down the street where I thought was home with  no sense of direction or anything.  And then a cop pulled up and grabbed me, and there was my panicked mother running up to  the car.  Oh, okay.  Because I guess the cop was right outside.  She went, my son is missing, and he went and looked around and found me.  How far were you from home?  Like two houses down?  It was probably really close.  But to me, it was like, you know, it was a journey for a little kid, but I wanted to 
[02:21:30]  play with that plane.  And then you know what happened?  Because I ran away?  I didn't get the plane.  No?  No.  She took the plane away as punishment for running away.  And what did your dad say?  He shouldn't be playing with planes on you.  I don't know.  He's drinking something.  Right.  Cleaning his guns.  He should be banging.  Cleaning his guns.  He's seven years old, Ro.  He should be banging bras.  Banging bras and working.  When is he going to contribute to this household, Ro?  He's just a kid, Joey.  Kid, when I was a kid.  Don't give me that shit, Ro. 
[02:22:00]  Nah, shut up, you piece of shit.  I'm a piece of shit.  Go fuck yourself.  Wham!  Spaghetti against the wall.  Just stop arguing.  Stop fighting.  I got a stomachache.  Kid doesn't have a stomachache.  You turned him into a pussy, Ro.  You want to turn him into a faggot?  You want to turn him into a faggot, Ro?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, I just should have fucking sucked cock and showed both of them. 
[02:22:30]  Look what you did to me.  Like it was yesterday, he remembers this stuff.  Hey, we got a great one coming in.  Constant.  Let go and let God.  Shut up, 12-step asshole.  It's a feedback.  No name, unfortunately, but the guy writes,  I said I love you to a co-worker as if she were my wife.  Just had nightmares about a harassment lawsuit.  Yeah.  That could get you in deep trouble.  I know I've tripped up on the phone like that, 
[02:23:00]  but I can't really remember exactly the circumstance.  I think there was an I love you in there once,  and it was somebody really inappropriate.  You ever call the wrong person?  You're like, oh, fuck, I don't want to talk to this fucking person.  Then you make up some bizarre reason why you're calling them.  Gotta go.  Hey, are you going to be in New York this weekend?  New York.  I live in Dallas, whatever.  I don't know.  Just wondering.  I had a dream about you the other night.  You just try to work your way out of that mess? 
[02:23:30]  That's a good one.  Had a dream about you.  Right.  Really disgusting.  Someone's saying, by the way,  that spaghetti against the wall never gets old.  Yeah, it did get old.  Hitler Satan from Norway.  Hey, Debbie.  Hitler Satan.  Lindenhurst, what's up?  It's evil.  Debbie?  Hey, Debbie.  Hold on, I didn't do my thing.  From Lindenhurst.  Now we're ready.  Isn't this great?  Great iced tea.  Hey, Debbie.  Debbie?  Hey.  Hi.  Hi, Debbie.  How are you?  My mom wasn't as bad as Opie's, 
[02:24:00]  but when I was in a bar when I was younger with my husband,  that we were going out,  reached into some other guy's pocket.  Why?  What were you looking for besides the others?  I don't know.  What do you think I was looking for?  A little cack?  A little cack?  You want a little cack?  Where's your cack?  Show me your cock.  Where's your cock?  And Debbie,  make it seem like Lindenhurst is the place to be.  So what happened?  Anything good?  The guy just kind of like looked at me, 
[02:24:30]  and when he turned his face,  I was like,  oh my God,  and just,  you know,  what are those bolts?  What are you doing?  Yeah,  the touching thing is really strange.  Well,  he thought he was,  yeah.  You ever have somebody online,  like maybe you were online at the movie,  and this is really awkward,  and some kid,  I think we've talked about this,  swings his arm and hits your dick?  I come like a jackrabbit.  It's so embarrassing.  Or when one of your friends does that,  like you're standing on line, 
[02:25:00]  and they swing their arm and hit your dick?  Yeah,  like,  oh,  my buddy just touched my cock.  Why do people say they come like a jackrabbit?  I mean,  I don't know,  who has seen a jackrabbit,  rabbit?  Well,  you've got to assume by how fast they fuck,  they've got to really like come.  Yeah.  I'm not going to say I come like a gorilla.  Why don't you keep talking,  Mars?  No problem.  I didn't,  there's a lot of mics.  I thought I was hearing voices in my head,  and then I turned to my left and went,  oh,  okay,  it's Mars.  Let's go to Tom the Trucker.  Tom,  what's up?  Hey,  I had a comment about, 
[02:25:30]  it was kind of along the line,  of your whole thinking somebody's waving to you,  and they're really waving to somebody behind you.  I find myself in situations where I'm standing around a lot of other truckers,  waiting to check in at a receiver or something,  and somebody will be on a Bluetooth headset and talking,  and you don't realize that they're on a Bluetooth,  and they're just talking,  and they're looking at you,  and you start answering them,  and then you realize that they're not talking to you,  and that can be a lot of a thing.  Yeah,  that happens in cabs a lot.  You'll give the cab,  you'll say like,  yeah,  I would need to go to 45th and 3rd or something, 
[02:26:00]  and they go,  okay,  and start driving,  and then you hear them go,  like,  and you go,  excuse me,  excuse me,  and they don't acknowledge you or anything,  and then you realize,  oh,  they're just talking to some terrorist.  That becomes funny.  After you fall victim to it,  so then you can stand back,  and you can watch everybody else do it.  That becomes funny.  You know,  before the Bluetooth craze,  when they just started getting out there,  Yeah.  how many people thought they were looking at crazy people? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Now it's pretty much accepted.  If you see someone babbling,  you're like,  oh,  they gotta be on a Bluetooth.  Just walking down the street,  talking to themselves.  Yeah,  but at first,  it was the most bizarre thing,  like,  what is wrong with that fucking person?  And it's the animated people,  really,  too,  because there are certain people that can just walk and talk,  and then there's people that have to,  like,  make hand movements,  and emote with their body,  and that looks really odd.  Right,  right.  How come if you're in a restaurant,  and somebody,  or whatever,  it doesn't matter,  and somebody's talking on a cell phone,  you get mad because you're talking? 
[02:27:00]  But if they were just with somebody else,  and they were talking,  you wouldn't get mad.  Do you know?  No,  I understand what you're saying.  He's kind of making a point.  You know,  like,  why don't you shut up?  You're on the,  you know,  we're trying to eat,  or whatever.  But if he was with company,  and talking.  If he was with company,  you wouldn't say that.  I guess because they don't,  talk like this,  when someone's across from them at the table,  hey!  Yeah,  maybe they talk a little louder.  That's the reason.  Fuck low,  but you're right,  if somebody else was there,  and they were talking,  it would be two people talking.  Also,  too, 
[02:27:30]  when I'm in a restaurant,  and somebody blows their nose,  I get crazy.  Yes.  If they're an older white guy,  I'll yell at them.  If they're like a big black dude,  I won't,  but you don't know who you,  you know,  if I know I can beat them,  but why would people blow their nose,  as I'm eating my big meal?  Yeah.  Go in the bathroom.  Go to the bathroom.  It's the worst.  First of all,  I don't think you're capable of really blowing your nose,  to that extent,  and cleaning everything up,  and knowing everything is spotless. 
[02:28:00]  You know?  Yeah.  I usually,  if I'm blowing my nose,  I want to be in front of a mirror,  because I want to make sure there's nothing sticking out.  Yeah.  I don't want any rubber bands left.  Oh,  the other day,  the other day I was picking my nose a little,  and I didn't realize it,  and I went to take a pee,  and next thing I know,  I see this booger on my dick.  Oh,  God damn.  I didn't know,  I didn't get it on my finger.  Oh,  fuck,  Rich.  I thought I had like a wart on the head of my dick,  and it was a little boogie.  Oh,  that's disgusting.  That one.  Holy shit. 
[02:28:30]  That's a tough one to listen to.  No wonder Bonnie won't put that thing in her fucking mouth.  All right,  let's go to,  back to Max in Dallas.  I think Max just makes up shit at this point,  but what the hell?  Booger dick Voss.  Maxie,  what's up?  That was a good one,  Voss.  I was rolling.  Now,  I'm making this shit up.  Three weeks ago,  my chick got into a pickup that was like the identical color is mine,  and looked at the guy and said,  what the hell are you doing to my husband's pickup? 
[02:29:00]  And it was another dude's truck.  It was just,  it was a safe,  now I'm punching out.  He was spiraling in,  but he,  he punched out in time.  I think we've gotten to wrong cars before.  I think that could happen.  Let's go to Kentucky.  John,  what's up?  Kentucky.  Hey,  how's it going,  guys?  Hey,  buddy.  P&A with O&A Survivor,  long ago.  Great night,  man,  I can't even remember it.  All right.  Wait,  wait,  what?  I was at P&A with O&A Survivor out in Buffalo.  Oh,  fuck.  Yeah,  I don't remember nothing but parking the car. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah,  that's like being in the NOM.  There's a few people that realize and remember and.  P&A with O&A.  Band of brothers.  And,  Anthony,  Buffalo is still part of New York,  not Canada.  All right.  I love Buffalo.  I really do.  I lived up there.  Buffalo is South Canada.  Good fans and people up there.  Yeah,  that kind of blew over real quick when you had the New York problem.  So what do you got there,  Johnny?  Yeah,  I was having a little Christmas get together at my house and my wife was behind me. 
[02:30:00]  I reached back to grab her,  uh,  crotch and it turned out to be my father-in-law had slipped in between us.  So I grabbed a handful of his gambit.  Oh,  shit.  Watch out,  guys.  That's pretty good.  Uh,  okay,  let's get,  uh,  cigars and scotch.  Cigars?  I'm sorry.  Why are you laughing?  That was funny.  Yeah,  like grabbing your father-in-law's crotch.  Oh,  I know what I do.  It's a big,  a big handful of father-in-law balls right in your hand. 
[02:30:30]  Nice,  right?  Nice.  That's what he says.  That's what he says to you.  Nice,  right?  Nice.  Thank you,  son.  I knew it.  I saw it in your eyes.  I might've told you this.  Let's say we lose the dead weight and get this party started.  Get rid of that gal.  Cock block.  When I,  uh,  when I was getting married to my first wife,  Kelly,  uh,  they were having an engagement party.  The whole families,  everybody was in there sitting down.  My family,  her family.  I might've told you this. 
[02:31:00]  And her last name was Gilligan.  So they get,  we opened a presence.  We opened a presence and I went to say thank you.  And I go,  I want to thank Mr.  and Mrs.  Wadley,  my ex-girlfriend's last name.  I said it in front of everybody.  Ooh.  Yeah,  that's a slip.  Oh man.  I did that once with a girlfriend.  What?  You ever do that?  You call a girlfriend by your ex's name?  Yeah,  all the time.  At the beginning of the relationship,  you really gotta watch your ass. 
[02:31:30]  I did it one time,  one time only.  Really?  Yeah.  I think a lot of people have done that.  Yeah,  that's,  that's a bad one.  I think a lot of people have done that,  but they're not really willing to admit it or talk about it.  It's because it's such a traumatic experience.  It's really bad,  but that one's one that you just like,  oh,  you gotta just profusely apologize.  It's just,  oh my god,  I'm sorry.  Oh my god,  I'm so sorry.  What do you do first? 
[02:32:00]  Do you apologize or wipe her face off first?  Which one do you do first?  No.  Oh my god,  you say that during like,  sex?  No,  no,  not,  not during sex.  Not,  never,  I've never done that during sex where you say the wrong name.  Why,  have you done that?  No,  no,  no.  But like,  you just walk in,  you're hanging out,  and then you go,  oh,  and then you say a name,  and go,  oh fuck,  that's not who I'm with right now.  I did it one time during sex,  and she goes,  who's Frank?  Rich.  Yeah, 
[02:32:30]  I've mentally rehearsed my naughty talk,  because I was like,  because I was like,  all right,  you're probably going to say the right name,  but let's just go through it.  Yeah,  exactly.  One time in your head.  You do not want to slip up,  man.  Oh,  hey,  let's say hi to,  there's some great ones coming in,  this was just such a throwaway thing that happened as we were setting up here,  but the phones,  they got,  you guys got them ringing.  Cigars,  go ahead,  I'm sorry,  getting back to you here.  I was at my mother-in-law's house,  and I came up behind what I thought was my wife, 
[02:33:00]  started doing a two-handed shoulder rub,  got my mouth right next to her ear,  did a creepy little like,  turned around,  it was my sister-in-law,  like a kick in the chest.  I can't explain my way out of this,  they don't even have the same hair.  What are you doing?  Oh,  and I remember another one.  Okay.  Cigars.  I was in the,  I was in a movie theater.  My girlfriend couldn't make it to the movies,  so I went with my brother's girlfriend, 
[02:33:30]  and we were just sitting in the movies,  watching,  watching the movie,  and at one point,  just unconsciously,  I reached over,  and put my hand on her thigh,  and like,  just rubbed like,  one rub,  and then,  I looked over,  and she's looking at me like,  what the fuck,  she's got a,  what the fuck are you doing face on,  I was like,  holy shit,  I'm so sorry,  oh my god,  I didn't,  oh my,  I,  because I was gonna go with my girlfriend, 
[02:34:00]  Bob,  I felt like such an ass,  turning completely fucking red,  I think your brain just lets its guard down every once in a while,  yeah,  it was one of those natural moves,  like,  I'm watching the movie,  I,  I really just thought,  I was with a girl,  it was my girlfriend,  I,  you know,  I was supposed to be there with my girlfriend,  so,  I just kinda,  womp,  explain the cock and the popcorn then,  yeah,  that's just mandatory,  I do that,  no matter who I go to the movies with,  here mom,  have some popcorn,  I don't even have to go to the movies, 
[02:34:30]  I just carry popcorn with it,  let's do it at home,  doesn't matter,  children's hospital,  whatever,  let's go to,  do you have change,  and hey,  you want some popcorn,  popcorn here,  let's go to Newberg,  Newberg,  what's up Mark,  good morning guys,  what,  what do we know about Newberg,  hmm,  I don't know,  what is Newberg known for,  is Newberg trivia,  yeah,  used to be known for a lot of crime,  yeah,  the Nuremberg trials,  oh no,  not Nuremberg,  Newberg, 
[02:35:00]  like my hometown is Centerport,  not much to know,  uh,  maybe,  a fishing port,  a lot of clamors in Centerport,  what,  what,  what can you tell us about Newberg,  not a whole lot,  you had that bridge that leads to the prison,  that's correct,  oh,  look at this,  Rich Voss knows a little bit about Newberg,  what bridge,  and what prison,  uh,  Newberg Beacon Bridge,  Newberg Beacon Bridge,  and it goes right past two of the biggest,  on each side,  just like a prison on each side,  they're unbelievable,  you can pull over and just stare at them all night, 
[02:35:30]  that sounds like a hell of an evening,  how bad do you need cops,  these are remarkable prisons,  I mean,  they look like this,  big mental institution prisons,  aren't they big,  what,  what ones are they called,  I have no clue,  Mark doesn't want to talk about Newberg,  what do you got Mark,  no way,  it doesn't matter,  I just don't know a whole lot about the town,  I've lived in for four years,  anyway,  I got out of the hospital,  I had my hand in a cast,  because I had cut some tendons and ligaments, 
[02:36:00]  I had a prostate operation,  so I had a colostomy bag sticking out of my cock,  and,  unfortunately,  I had a,  my well pump had gone at my house,  and I called all over the place,  looking for someone to fix it,  and no one couldn't,  and I find a plumber,  and I said,  oh yeah,  no problem,  you sound like you're in a real tough bind,  well can I,  can I make the obvious joke,  your well and your pump also was on the fritz,  so I finally find a plumber that's willing to come up and do it,  and just, 
[02:36:30]  not thinking about it,  I said,  oh man,  I love you,  and there was silence on the phone,  and he's like,  excuse me,  I said,  oh no,  no,  I'm just really happy you can make it,  he goes,  yeah,  just give me a handshake,  that's all,  oh,  you intentionally said it though,  you're a plumber,  you're a plumber,  you're a plumber,  you're excited to see him,  yeah,  alright,  thanks sir,  let's go to Carl in Jersey,  Carl,  hey,  what's happening,  hey,  I was in the cafeteria lunchroom,  and I was sitting across from a friend of mine,  I know we're eating,  and I reached down,  I thought I dropped a piece of,  you know,  crumb on my shirt, 
[02:37:00]  I eat it,  and I think to myself,  I haven't been eating corn,  why does this taste like corn,  and he coughs,  and another piece hits me,  and I looked,  and he's eating corn,  and I guess that was,  oh,  shit,  oh,  you ate someone else's spit up,  wow,  just the fact that he was going to eat his own food off his, 
[02:37:30]  dude,  where's my weed,  Florida cops give out a number to reclaim 60 pounds of pot,  look at that picture on MSNBC,  to reclaim,  do we know a little more about that,  why would they,  that's silly,  dude,  where's my weed,  let's,  there's a couple more coming in,  Joe Curry had a real bad one too,  playing foot,  we were smoking pot,  and pretty stoned,  and someone hawked a loogie,  on a chain link fence,  and it stretched between two links, 
[02:38:00]  on the chain link fence,  and the guy that did it went,  oh,  man,  look at that loogie,  he goes,  look at that loogie,  or loogie,  whatever he said,  Joe Curry thought he said,  look at that dube,  thinking that there was a joint,  wedged in the fence,  so all we saw,  was him go,  was our friend go,  look at that loogie,  and,  plank foot walk up,  and grabbed it,  and pulled it toward him, 
[02:38:30]  thinking it was a joint,  he was that fucked up,  and we had no idea,  what his mindset was,  we were like,  why is he grabbing,  someone's fucking lung snot,  hanging from a fence,  yeah,  snot is a rough one,  Justin in Kansas,  Justin,  yo,  what's up dude,  hey man,  go back for holidays,  with my new chicken and everything,  and,  a bunch of us go out,  you know,  local bar there,  get all fucked up,  and,  go back home, 
[02:39:00]  well my brother's there too,  you know,  go home with the chick,  lay in bed,  she's like,  I gotta go pay,  she's all drunk,  comes back in,  I end up passing out,  wake up next morning,  she's laying in bed with my brother,  she,  she's in bed with your brother,  yeah,  well she got all fucked up,  got in her own bed,  and what not,  and I'm punching out,  one time,  intentional maybe,  one time I was at the gym, 
[02:39:30]  and I was bench pressing,  so I go to this guy,  can you spot me,  actually I went,  and a lunger flew out of my mouth,  and he was,  and landed on his pants,  and it's so embarrassing,  like when you're cleaning your lunger off,  it wasn't a big one,  it was just a little,  flying mucus,  that came out of my throat,  I'm grunting,  he returned the favor,  by teabag,  during the next set,  push the weights,  back on your neck,  and fuck your mouth,  let's go to John,  North Carolina, 
[02:40:00]  it wasn't at Attica,  speaking of Attica,  John's got something for you,  I think,  I can't believe you let this one go by,  Rich Voss,  with his hot prison stories,  now he's telling you,  where the hot prisons are,  yeah,  where you can stand at night,  and watch hot prisoners,  from the bridge,  he's got a nice view,  in the cell block C,  yeah,  what's that,  you're obsessed with prisons,  Rich,  let's go to Jeff in Texas,  Jeff, 
[02:40:30]  hey,  I had that similar mistake,  slipping up,  telling people things on the phone,  I would,  I left my ex-wife,  we had to make the whole,  kid exchange,  custody thing,  calling up to me,  arranged to make that change,  and I,  made that little slip up,  where,  when we were hanging up the phone,  I go,  I love you,  for a habit of being married,  for six years,  and that,  so you said,  love you to your ex-wife,  so you looked like a douche,  oh,  it was my choice to leave,  so here I am thinking,  oh great,  she's thinking,  I want to fix things now,  not you, 
[02:41:00]  yeah,  oops,  sorry,  anyways,  punch it out guys,  thanks,  thanks sir,  Chris in Carolina,  we get so many calls from Carolina,  it's time to acknowledge that,  Chris,  what do you got?  Well,  my brother and I had a boat,  and,  we could actually stay out on it,  for the weekend,  our wives would go out,  and,  we'd usually get pretty messy,  messed up,  play cards,  and the girls went to bed,  and so,  I was turning in,  and got in the, 
[02:41:30]  the bunk,  where I assumed my wife,  was going to be,  and kind of spooned up,  and I was like,  hey,  and my brother's wife,  was kind of like,  hey,  it was kind of an awkward moment,  where it was kind of like,  well,  you know,  do I go with this or not,  and I was like,  well,  no,  I better just get the fuck out of this bed,  and nothing happened after that?  Oh,  fuck no,  no,  Jesus Christ,  it was just like,  oh God,  oh God,  oh God,  you know,  because that was not a good one. 
[02:42:00]  That's,  that's a good one.  There you go,  getting in bed with the brother's wife.  Thank you,  sir.  I have another real quick one.  Oh,  yeah.  This time I was producing a radio show in Philadelphia,  and the talent of that show texted me,  calling me baby,  and that he was going back to his hotel room for a little nappy.  Yes,  thank you.  That is true.  I forgot about that.  Love and miss. 
[02:42:30]  You fucker.  Mike in Kentucky,  what's up?  Hey,  a year ago at Christmas,  I was at,  I was at my house,  doing a Christmas dinner thing.  I walked into the kitchen,  and saw what I thought was my wife,  getting something out of the oven,  walked up behind her,  and gave her a good goose,  and it was my mother-in-law.  Oh,  you goosed your mother-in-law?  Her ass looks like your,  your wife's ass.  Oh,  that's not very good.  There you go.  If you mistake your mother-in-law's ass for your wife's. 
[02:43:00]  All right.  We should take a break.  Sure.  We can continue with this,  no problem.  We got other things to do,  too.  Drag queen,  hit McDonald's manager with the,  with the tire iron.  That's a good story today.  AJ Poop,  a new character,  doing a wow promo.  AJ Poop.  Oh,  I got a good one.  It'll speak for itself,  I guess.  I'm sure it will.  Is it better?  Is it good?  We're being encouraged to try to bring,  uh,  some of our back office antics, 
[02:43:30]  to the,  on air,  and,  we'll see how it turns out.  So,  we're going to introduce everybody to AJ Poop,  next.  All right.  Oh,  boy.  All right.  Welcome.  Welcome,  AJ Poop,  to the family.  We meet AJ Poop,  next.  Stay tuned.  Every knee must bend,  every head must bow,  every tongue must confess,  thou art the greatest,  the greatest of all time.  Ella,  Ella,  A,  A.  Yeah, 
[02:44:00]  we suck.  Opian Anthony,  y'all.  It's the Opian Anthony show,  on XM Satellite Radio.  We have no bosses.  Hmm.  Henry Crinkley.  Henry.  From Hopper Street writes, 
[02:44:30]  I'm a cop.  You idiot.  I'm working with a guy I hardly know.  A chick is walking towards us smiling.  I say to him,  I wonder what this ugly cunt wants.  No.  He proceeds to tell me it's his girlfriend.  Ow.  Is that the one with all the shit in her face?  That's my wife.  Hey,  we gotta meet AJ Poop.  But we can't blow off Jeff in Middletown.  Jeff,  what's up?  Hey guys,  what's up?  Hey.  I was playing a volleyball game, 
[02:45:00]  and right before it started,  my hemorrhoid that I was,  that I had for a while,  had burst.  But I was prepared for this,  so I took some of those tux pads  and plugged it up there  to soak up all the dark blood.  And during the...  Are you guys still there?  Yeah,  I'm just fucking gagging.  Dark hemorrhoid blood  being sucked up in a tux pad.  Okay.  We're with you.  Thank God it's in between meals right now.  Oh, my nose. 
[02:45:30]  I dove for a ball in one play,  and I felt a little slippage,  and I knew that it fell out.  So I tried kicking it under the sand,  and I realized during the next play  that someone had stepped on it  and was investigating what it was.  So to make a long story short,  I know this stuff...  It's already a long story.  You can't say to me...  Shut up.  It's fucking not ready.  I don't care.  I love you, boss. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I love you.  So the next game,  I had shoved another pack  of tux up there,  and when I felt it getting  really soaked with blood,  I very awkwardly stuck my hand  down my pants to pull it out,  and then when no one was looking,  I tried to throw it out of bounds,  like over a fence,  and I guess the blood  didn't like weigh it down enough.  So it got stuck on this fence, 
[02:46:30]  and it spread out perfectly  like a bloody flower,  and then everyone was looking  at it afterwards like,  what the fuck is that?  Alright, that's pretty disgusting  and embarrassing.  Right on, Jeff.  I think we're going to take one more.  It's Neil in Houston.  Neil, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, boys?  What up?  Oh, dude, I can't even believe  I'm telling the story,  but about,  probably a couple years ago,  I was managing a restaurant,  and for some reason,  I guess I had the feeling  to just go jacked, 
[02:47:00]  and so when I finished,  I walked out my office door,  one of my servers asked me,  what was that?  With this horrified look on it,  because I looked down,  I had cum on my leg.  Oh, man.  I was mortified.  I just turned around,  and walked in and cleaned it off.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Thank God.  There you go.  On stage one time,  I was wearing white painter pants  when I first started comedy. 
[02:47:30]  I didn't have any underwear on,  and I took a piss in the bathroom,  I didn't realize,  but it left yellow,  bright yellow stains,  and I'm on stage,  and some girl in the audience goes,  look, he has piss stains,  and the whole audience  was pointing at me.  That's the horror.  I was only doing comedy  for like three or four years,  and I had to close the show,  and it was the beginning of my set,  so I'm up there the whole time,  and all I'm thinking about  is everybody's looking at these  bright yellow piss stains.  Everyone's just looking  at your piss stains.  Look, he's got piss stains. 
[02:48:00]  What a cunt.  Jesus, keep your mouth shut.  And then one time  in Fort Lauderdale,  right before I was ready  to go on,  I farted,  but a little shit came out,  and I had to run in the bathroom  and take my underwear off  and put it in the garbage  and go up on stage  with like shitty ass.  You know what I mean?  Like, you could just feel  the moisture.  Oh, who hasn't  this underwear?  Oh, God.  Damn.  Rich, you're disgusting.  You really are like an old man. 
[02:48:30]  He's shitting himself  he's pissing himself,  he's putting snot on his dick.  You do things  that like old men do.  Piss yourself and shit yourself.  Right.  And have snot on your dick.  Hey, let's,  oh, we're going over there?  All right.  Aw, yeah.  We get to meet AJ Poop.  Yeah, it's not even his full name.  What's his full name?  What's his full name?  It's AJ Poop.  AJ Jingleheimer Poop.  As we ask what is his name, 
[02:49:00]  his full name, whatever,  Sam walks in.  Why is he shaking his head, too?  Like, he's a little disgusted.  Are you AJ Poop?  Well, the, uh...  What's his full name, Sam?  His full name would be  would be AJ Poopy Shits.  AJ Poopy Shits.  Wow.  Yes.  All right.  Are you feeling all right?  Sell it, Sam.  Well, sell it.  Yeah.  Many months ago, 
[02:49:30]  this character was invented  when we were back in the office  after a show.  Why is Danny coming in?  Wait a minute.  Danny's coming in, Mata.  Danny was there when we invented it.  We were watching, uh...  I just wanted to reiterate that  this wasn't months.  Like, this was at least over a year ago  because we had...  Oh, okay.  We had a different executive producer  at the time.  Ah, okay, sure.  That was a while ago.  So we were watching, like, the news  and this guy came on reporting  and he sounded...  He had a lisp and everything.  He had the whole sort of  stereotypical gay thing going on. 
[02:50:00]  Ah.  But it wasn't a sexual thing.  It was the news.  So I started speaking  in that type of voice  but all I would talk about  was how much I liked women.  Right.  Which, to a room full of guys  who hadn't gotten a whole lot of sleep  and had just gotten off work  was hilarious.  Yeah.  Uh, Steve was one of those guys  and when Steve hears people laughing  he insists that this needs to get on the air  to which I said, 
[02:50:30]  no, Steve, it doesn't need to get on the air.  Um, however,  Steve, uh, uh, has decided  that from now on  anything that gets a laugh  must be submitted  to be put on the air.  Oh, that's a good idea, though.  Oh, my God.  That's a good idea.  That's kind of funny.  Yeah.  So...  Could work in many different ways.  None of them good.  No.  About time to learn that lesson.  You've been here over three years. 
[02:51:00]  So, because of that  I was, uh, forced,  I would say forced  into making, uh,  a promo as, uh,  A.J. Poopy Shits.  Okay.  Oh, that's the guy's name  with the effeminate voice?  Yeah, actually,  I said,  I thought of A.J.  and Steve  was able to help me out  by thinking of the  Poopy Shits part.  Ah, okay.  You could sell this character  to Loper and Schmitty,  you know that.  I'm...  Schmitty Balls  would love this one.  Schmitty Balls.  Formally known as  Wicker Face Pants, 
[02:51:30]  what?  Whisker Basket.  I have no idea.  Wicker...  Whisker Biscuit, I think.  Fucking biscuit.  Oh, whatever.  Wicker Basket  or Whisker Biscuit  or some shit.  Let's meet A.J. Poopy Shits.  Poopy Shits.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  Hi, I'm A.J. Poopy Shits.  I love chicks  and I love tits.  It's my favorite part of chicks.  That's why I love  the Opie and Anthony show  and their Wow Sticker promotion.  You just log on  to the website,  get yourself a sticker,  throw it on the back  of your hoopty,  and you get to see 
[02:52:00]  some great chicks  and their tits.  Who could ask for more?  It's certainly not me.  I'm all men  and if there's one thing  that men like,  it's chicks.  Sometimes at home,  I'll stand in front of the mirror  totally buck naked  and tuck my dick  in between my legs.  Pretend I'm a chick  with great tits.  Toodles.  All right.  It's the first observation  of many.  Yeah, yeah.  You do that way too good. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, I'll give you that.  Look, he's crying.  He's tearing up.  Just hearing your work  on the air like that  must be an emotional moment.  It's too country.  It's too country.  I don't like AJ poopy shit.  Neither do I.  I love him!  Whoa!  I love him!  Yeah, yeah.  The voice,  you do it very well.  It's so well  that it's disturbing.  Yeah.  It's kind of disturbing.  And then the imagery 
[02:53:00]  that came to mind  with the nudity  and the tucking  was, again,  very sexy.  I can't take full credit  for the writing,  but I will take partial credit.  Oh, okay.  I think we need more  AJ poopy shit's promos.  And the music  in the background  was very good.  You should do, like,  a chick report.  Oh, okay.  You're like the expert  chick guy.  Yeah.  All right.  That'd be good.  Something maybe like  you're on location  at spring break.  Well, just like maybe...  Aw, looking at the hot chicks. 
[02:53:30]  Maybe just talking about  like the hot chicks  in pop culture.  Just like you write up  a whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What chicks you find hot  and why.  Like a celebrity gossip.  Celebrities, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All the hot movie chicks  or TV  or something like that.  Well, that would just be  a joy to do.  Something bad.  Or F.  That's what it's lying in.  G-Baby  from OA Experience  writes,  that was hilariously bad.  Wayne Green  from Calgary 
[02:54:00]  writes,  Sam,  that was awful.  Boo.  Oh, boo.  And Gabe  from Staten Island  writes,  this is worse  than Spuds Buckley.  Linger Lager.  Oh, no.  That was hurtful, sir.  I also saw it.  I didn't see who it was.  AJ's shitty bit.  Hey.  You know.  I think it has potential.  Sometimes  it takes a while  for him to catch on.  And sometimes, 
[02:54:30]  you know,  they just fall on their ass.  But he's hitting on it.  He's definitely  hitting on something.  Like,  you do see  some of these guys  out there.  You're associated with them  and they're all about,  you know,  how they have to,  like,  just try to sell  that they really like chicks.  Don Wicklin?  Well,  I said some guys.  Someone who acts  very effeminate  and gay,  yet is constantly  pushing how manly  he is on people.  And to completely  try to throw us off  he got married, 
[02:55:00]  yes.  That would be him,  yes.  That still didn't fool me.  Not a bit.  Not a bit.  Not a bit.  Sam,  you're in trouble.  I just got an IM  from Steve.  AJ Poopy Shits  is a hit.  Hit.  Exclamation point.  It is.  It's kind of a hit.  It is, okay.  Because you barely  recognize it's you  and that's what's  so creepy about it.  The pilot has definitely  sold a few episodes.  He's just got  a couple episodes.  You got a few episodes 
[02:55:30]  out of it.  We look forward  to the next AJ Poopy Shits.  We could even put  that quote on the poster,  AJ Shitty Bit.  Could be right on her.  It could be.  Critics are saying  you can't rock that.  I am not doing my job.  Pat D from Matawan.  Yes.  Let's get Sam  a Lopweiser for that.  Oh, yeah.  Chop, chop.  Lopweiser.  No way that's ready.  For AJ Poopy.  Poor Iraq.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He has no idea. 
[02:56:00]  You know the part  of the show  where we try to keep  storylines going there,  Iraq?  This is one of them.  The Lopweiser thing  is still a hot thing.  Look at him.  Still nothing.  We got it?  I'm really thirsty.  Where is it?  He's parched.  I'd like to be congratulated.  How about you  put the sound  in my machine?  Do you understand  how quick  the Loper  and fucking shitty  get their Lopweisers open?  That's what  fucking makes radio.  All right.  We're still waiting,  Iraq. 
[02:56:30]  By tomorrow,  I want the Lopweiser  sound effect  in my machine, please.  I thought you just  wanted it played  on the radio show  by tomorrow.  That'd be novel.  He's got nothing.  You could have  gone downstairs,  bought a beer,  come up and open it  on the mic.  Wow.  And then Danny  would have drank it.  I'm thirsty.  I need something  to drink so bad.  And you earned it.  You earned that beer.  Yes, yes.  That Lopweiser.  Oh, here we go. 
[02:57:00]  Okay, here it is.  Hold on, hold on.  All right, yeah, go ahead.  Ah, there it is.  Thank you.  We had to do it live.  That's actually  used Foley,  old Foley sound.  Next, we're going to  make the sound  of a horse.  AJ Poop.  What?  I said AJ Poop.  Oh, you got the first one.  He didn't even write  the full name on this.  He just hands you a CD  that says AJ Poop on it.  Here's your AJ Poop.  Now get lost. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  All right, well,  we look forward to,  yeah, more of that.  Me too.  Hey, we got swarmy,  what, songs?  Or cheesy?  What are we talking about here?  Yeah, cheesy songs.  And remember that pot story  we just talked about  while we get this  out of the way too?  Some dude lost  like 60 pounds of pot.  Pot.  How's this machine  going to work there, Than?  It's loading,  and can I push from here?  Not yet.  You have to do that,  and then I can push from here?  Oh, poor Bill's got a shill  for that fucking,  ugh.  What?  I know.  Clinton.  I'm just watching Bill Clinton 
[02:58:00]  like, the guy was president.  Understandable.  You know,  he did get his dick sucked  in the Oval Office,  but he was the president,  and now he's just shilling  for his wife.  It's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing for a former president.  Of course it is.  The guy was the guy,  he had the job.  Do you think his wife  makes him go to a Baptist breakfast  on Sunday morning?  Probably,  the way he's doing it.  Do you,  don't you think  if you held a job,  and then your wife,  who you really don't like, 
[02:58:30]  is trying to get that job,  you would want to,  to like,  push her into that?  He's got that  to hold over her head forever.  You have these political aspirations there,  but I was fucking president.  I reached the pinnacle  of those aspirations.  You,  on the other hand,  you're in Congress,  whatever.  You don't want,  or Senate,  Senator Hillary Clinton,  yeah.  You don't want her  to get the gig 
[02:59:00]  that you had.  It's embarrassing a little bit.  It's a little weird,  I think.  It is weird,  and that he's just  this guy now  that's kind of smiling  and going,  well,  you got to vote for her.  He's the one.  He's got to vote for her.  Are you sure  he's endorsing her?  He hasn't officially come out.  Imagine he comes out  and goes,  well,  Obama.  Obama.  Obama.  And if you are waking up today  and realize that maybe  you misplaced something, 
[02:59:30]  how about  60 pounds of pot?  Give the Florida Highway Patrol  a call.  They're holding it for you.  And follow this advice.  You deserve what you get.  If you call them,  cops found two large garbage bags  stuffed with marijuana plants  on the side of Interstate 4  near Tampa.  It's worth over 50 grand,  so cops figure it's possible  someone might be stupid enough  to try and reclaim it.  So they put out a press release  with their phone number.  We'll call you  and let you know  if anyone actually called in to them. 
[03:00:00]  It's so worth it to call.  Oh, yeah.  That's the laziest force  on the planet.  Hey, listen,  we're not going to really go out  and look,  but if you...  If you come to us,  what's the phone number?  We'll arrest you.  Let's call.  What is the number?  Let's say it's ours.  Can we have some pot?  Do you have my pot?  Where's my pot?  I lost my pot  on the side of the road.  We should do it.  Tell me you lost 65 pounds.  What?  Say you lost 65 pounds.  Yeah.  Where's the other five pounds? 
[03:00:30]  Where is it?  Are you taking my pot?  We both know  that you took a little of that pot.  All right.  We got a cheesy ballad playlist.  Now, what is this?  The cheesiest songs...  The cheesiest songs of all time.  Of all time.  Now, by cheesy...  Now, I haven't looked at the list.  I don't want to ruin this for me.  I like guessing things.  By cheesy,  do we mean lovey-dovey cheesy?  Do we mean cheesy like 
[03:01:00]  Weird Al Yankovic cheesy?  What's the criteria for the cheese?  Well, this is cheesy ballad.  Cheesy ballads.  So, they're sappy, maybe?  Sappy, lovey-dovey.  Or contrived...  Okay.  I think I got it.  Shannon has drifted out to sea.  That type of song, right?  Who's Shannon?  Don't you remember her song?  She's drifted out to sea.  I don't think...  I don't think...  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-dang-dang...  50s songs are on there. 
[03:01:30]  No.  Shannon is gone, I heard.  She's drifted out to sea.  What song was that?  You better know.  I have no idea what Rich Voss is talking about.  We don't go back to the Tin Pan Alley.  No.  What's that?  Vaudeville?  No.  I can't believe I was able to work in the Tin Pan Alley.  Listen.  They take a music class in high school.  There's people out there that understand my hell.  I want to learn about music, and we had to learn about the Tin Pan Alley days.  Well, this is it.  Gave up on the Lopweiser, did you?  Wait. 
[03:02:00]  Wait, hold on.  Who sings this?  Is this the song I just sang?  I think so.  Henry Gross.  Wait, hold on.  Yeah.  This is pretty sappy, by the way.  Not really.  Oh.  I hardly know what...  What about Christmas Shoes?  Christmas Shoes, Roe.  Christmas Shoes, Roe.  It makes me cry every time.  Christmas Shoes.  We're getting close to playing Christmas Shoes.  Christmas Shoes.  We certainly are.  Hey, we'll play that tomorrow.  Christmas Shoes. 
[03:02:30]  Welcome to holiday season, and with a playing of Christmas Shoes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shannon is gone.  Oh.  All right.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Yuck.  No, Pendulum is not the cheesiest song of all time.  Ah, Pendulum.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's, uh, well, we can run through a couple of these.  Why don't you play the, uh, track number 19? 
[03:03:00]  This is, uh, 19 on the list of ultimate cheesy ballad songs.  Mm-hmm.  19.  This song.  Mine aren't numbered on this list.  They're all here.  I just don't have a number of them.  Shut the fuck up.  How about you get a list?  Mine aren't numbered on this list.  If you're going to be, oh, fuck it.  E-Rock.  Count from one down.  Right?  I love how everyone tries to blame each other. 
[03:03:30]  It's like, if you're going to be the guy that's going to go to the computer and play these  songs, wouldn't you be well prepared?  Make sure you have the list.  Right.  I have the list.  They're all ready to go.  I just don't have a number order on the list.  Shouldn't you have a number order?  Why don't you have the same list as me, Bill?  I hope he has a number order.  This is the one I was given.  Well, it doesn't matter.  You should have one with numbers on it.  I didn't know yours had numbers on it.  Otherwise, I would have asked.  Why would we want to give away the song ahead of time so you know which one to play?  People get sick of us tearing down radio walls. 
[03:04:00]  But seriously, how does that work?  Hey, guys.  Well, Starship, nothing going to stop us now.  That's your cue to play the 19th song there, E-Rock.  Now he's running in here.  God, I hope this is the day he comes after me.  You think he's going to come in swinging?  Oh, it's going to happen.  Why are you running away?  Not running away.  He didn't want to fight you.  Pussy.  Where were you going?  Trying to get a list with numbers on it.  But everyone's just standing there and smiling.  You don't need it anymore. 
[03:04:30]  Smiling.  Not smiling.  We're laughing at you.  And you don't need it anymore because I just gave the song away.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Don't you guys have a number guy here?  Travis is in there helping.  That's cute.  Is it playing?  I don't think so.  Ah, wow.  Here it is.  I just see his eyes peering over the top of the monitor and he's angry. 
[03:05:00]  There it is.  Number one.  And there goes the list.  Opie is in complete disgust.  There you go, Iraq.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  Throw your list away.  I don't feel like doing it now.  Clear the computer of the songs.  Don't stop believing it was number one.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, that was 20 minutes we wanted to do right there. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, boy.  Local resident in Philly writes, someone get E-Rock a dope wiser.  You got a dope wiser for yourself?  Oh, my God.  There it is.  There you go.  Drink that dope wiser.  It was a dope wiser.  You actually had to push the dope wiser sound effect.  E-Rock. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, E-Rock.  Are you sleeping?  I'm fine.  Oh.  Whoa.  That didn't sound fine.  What?  No, I'm fine.  Oh, I thought that was a recording.  Yeah, you thought it was like a sound drop or something?  Shut up for two minutes.  Wow.  Steve's angry, too.  Dogshit Sniffer writes, all E-Rock knows is that the number two is a Big Mac with fries.  That's a number one.  Ooh.  Snow that. 
[03:06:30]  Look at you showing some knowledge.  Poor E-Rock.  He's getting the brunt of things.  Let's say hi to Matt in Queensbury.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys, did you notice Voss' brilliant help in that countdown when E-Rock didn't have  a list?  Voss goes, you just count from one down.  One down.  One.  Yeah, if you look at the list and you take the top one and you put one next to it, you 
[03:07:00]  can get to 19.  That's counting up, though, where we come from.  What are you talking about?  One, two, oh, you're right.  Punch it out, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, but you're going down the page.  So Don't Stop Believing is the cheesiest ballad of all time?  Yeah.  That song rules.  I wouldn't have.  That song ruled way before the Sopranos used it, by the way.  Way before.  Here it is.  Cheese. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, John.  Why is this the cheesiest ballad of all time?  We could come up with better ones than this.  I know.  That's a good song.  It's a great song.  See, everyone can kind of, you know, chuckle at Journey these days, but they were gigantic  in the early 80s.  Just gigantic.  When the lights go down in the city.  It was considered mainstream rock. 
[03:08:00]  Not like schlock.  There's nothing wrong with Journey.  I can't sit here and, like, listen to people crashing Journey.  There's nothing wrong with the band to this day.  I mean, there are no Black Oak, Arkansas, but...  Hey.  Name one...  Too goof on Black Oak, Arkansas.  Name one embarrassing Journey song.  Um, okay.  Yeah.  Give me a Journey list.  I got that one.  There are a couple. 
[03:08:30]  Name one, though.  You gotta slow down a little bit, because I think there are a couple.  Name one, though.  It's a little challenge.  Let me think.  This isn't...  Lights is cool.  Any way you want is cool.  Especially because of the Caddyshack angle.  Yeah.  Uh...  Open arms?  Yeah, well, you know, for what it's worth.  Lie here beside me. 
[03:09:00]  Separate ways is a little, man.  Separate ways?  Yeah, this is pretty, um...  Is this like...  Was this a wedding song?  No, he was writing this about, uh...  John Kennedy's daughter.  All right, Vox.  I say, uh...  We're...  Game's still on.  Open arms?  Isn't that bad. 
[03:09:30]  What about that one where he's, uh...  Where they were on the tour bus in the video.  Where he was shaving.  His mustache off.  Was that Cherie?  When he went solo?  Uh, his solo stuff's pretty bad.  Oh, Cherie, or whatever it was.  Oh, Cherie.  Oh, oh.  Give me their list of songs there, Thanh.  Faithfully.  Yeah.  Faithfully is kinda...  Faithfully?  Yeah.  That was a bad one.  God damn it, she fine. 
[03:10:00]  Who's crying now?  I know, this, uh...  This Puerto Rican girl that, what, had pepper spray on her?  What the hell did she have on her?  Yeah, somebody tried to, uh, sabotage her winning the Miss, uh, Puerto Rico, uh...  She is so fuckin' hot.  It's unbelievable.  She's perfect.  They put pepper spray on her face and in her dress and...  Oh, they could put battery acid on her and I'd still eat her.  Ooh.  Oh, Cherie was not a Journey song.  Yeah.  That was a, uh...  It was a Steve Perry song.  Uh, Opie, Faithfully. 
[03:10:30]  A lot of people saying Faithfully.  Yeah, this is a little...  So silly.  And Russ from Alabama, I don't need a ruling, you ass.  All right.  All right, done.  This bit's done now, too.  Yeah.  Speed round.  Another bit done.  Yeah.  What's next?  Let's go.  Come on, we're on.  We're on a roll.  We're on a roll.  We're on a roll.  Wham, wham, over.  Over, Faithfully.  Horrible song.  The rest of Journey's still, for the most part, cool. 
[03:11:00]  There you go.  End of story.  End of discussion.  They had to put an album out.  They needed a couple more songs.  End of story.  Here we go.  This will kill a minute.  Curling iron, earrings, lipstick, makeup, usually items that women use to get their day started.  But according to police, three guys actually got all dolled up before committing some unladylike behavior at a Hickory Hill McDonald's.  These three guys are accused of dressing up like women and behaving badly.  Memphis police say they attacked three workers at this Mickey D's in the 3600 block of Mendenhall Sunday night. 
[03:11:30]  After placing an order at the drive-thru, police say the cross-dressers weren't loving the service, and that's when things got heated.  Workers told police, that's when the guys came inside the restaurant and started a fight.  Came in the restaurant.  They're accused of hitting the manager with the tire iron, and when he fought back, that's when they kicked off their stiletto boots and took off their hoop earrings and really let them have it.  Fucked him in the ass.  Left side of the head with a wet floor sign.  With a wet floor sign. 
[03:12:00]  Nice.  What I want to know is he fought back after he was hit with a tire iron.  When this fucking guy have a fucking helmet, after you get hit with a tire iron, you go to the hospital.  You don't fight back.  It's not a movie where you just keep going.  Yeah, tire iron is followed by fucking emergency rooms.  If somebody hit me with a tire, I'd quit.  Fuck the iron.  The iron.  You're just a rubber part.  A fucking tire iron.  How do you take a tire iron?  That's a tough guy.  Unless, you know, the cross-dressers really kind of didn't hit him hard with it, and it just poked him with it. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, you're bleeding.  You don't come back from a tire iron.  Fuck back.  When you hit somebody with a tire iron and they're still standing, that's when you just fucking turn around and run.  You don't take your earrings off.  Well, not these guys.  They took the earrings off and beat them up.  All right.  End of story.  What's next?  All right, well, let's...  Speed round.  Let's move into Morning Zoo Bit of the Day.  Love Morning Zoo Bit of the Day.  Yes. 
[03:13:00]  Richard from Alabama, no, you need a ruler shoved up your ass.  Thank you, sir.  Here's your Morning Zoo Bit of the Day.  This is a Campbell's Chunk Soup with Britney Spears bit.  This is heard on several morning shows, including the syndicated Dave and Jimmy show.  Dave and Jimmy?  I knew he's been gone for a few days.  Where the fuck?  Dave and Jimmy.  And the Do Dave show on KDWB in Minneapolis.  The what?  The Do Dave.  What about AJ Poopy Shits? 
[03:13:30]  Or whatever the fuck his name is.  I want Sam to do that live.  Wow, that could be rough.  Yeah.  Well, right now, you want to see if he...  Because I'm thinking he makes, like, facial expressions.  Yeah.  And maybe body movements.  Does he put his hands on his hips?  He is a little twink.  I think he's method.  I think he gets into the character.  Do you get into character?  Like Mr. Imus.  Yeah.  You've got to use characters.  All right. 
[03:14:00]  Don't look at him.  All right.  No one can.  Do you turn around and fix your hair?  No one can.  Yeah, it might look something like this.  Let's go to Cam 1.  Wait, we have a girl that ate 10 pounds of her own hair.  What?  Laura from St. Louis sent that in to us.  That's crazy.  We got that story?  I've got to hear about that one.  Okay.  Hold on a second.  AJ Poopy Shits is in the studio.  AJ Poopy Shits.  And you could...  I guess you could intro, like, Morning Zoo bit of the day. 
[03:14:30]  And talk about how hot Britney Spears is.  It's because you're all about the chicks with tits.  And that's your catchphrase, by the way.  Don't forget.  Chicks with tits?  Yeah.  You could have used that a little more in your promo.  I was feeling like you got a catchphrase now.  Mm-hmm.  That you like chicks and their tits.  Okay.  Was that the line?  I think so.  Yeah.  All right.  Stop talking like salmon.  And now let's say hi to AJ Poopy Shits.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  This is AJ Poopy Shits. 
[03:15:00]  I'm here on the One Show.  Just having a great...  Just having a great time with the guys.  We're here to talk about Britney Spears.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What do you mean you're having a great time with the guys?  That sounds a little weird.  AJ Poopy Shits.  No, just guys being guys.  Talking about chicks and their tits.  He does.  He does.  He does.  I knew he would look exactly like this when he did it.  I'm just watching him on the camera so I don't throw him off.  I don't want to throw you off.  I want this to work so I'm turned around and it's kind of looking through the pal talk camera. 
[03:15:30]  I just am here.  We want to talk about Britney Spears and her fabulous tits or guzungas and just how great  they've been looking lately.  And hopefully this morning's zoo bit of the day will be all about tits because that's all  I'm into.  You like the tits, right?  I friggin' love them.  But she's not really that hot, AJ Poopy Shits.  Back in the day she was.  Yeah, you seem not to really know who's hot.  Yeah, you don't understand when someone...  You can't just say Britney Spears is hot. 
[03:16:00]  You gotta understand that maybe her hot days are long gone.  Come on, dude.  Long gone.  Chicks are chicks and tits are tits.  I mean, get real.  He just loves tits.  Well, he's gotta keep the catchphrase.  But don't you think her tits are saggy by now, AJ Poopy Shits?  I guess they're a little saggy.  I mean, they could be better.  Yeah.  But they're certainly better than like something on a guy or something.  And you don't like guys, right?  Oh, no.  I mean, guys being guys and stuff is cool, but chicks is where it's at for me. 
[03:16:30]  Married man, Mr. Poopy Shits?  I'm a...  I'm playing the field right now, actually.  Oh, okay.  Playing the field.  Trying to get as many chicks as I can right now.  Yeah.  It's been going pretty well.  Yeah?  Great.  Why don't you tell us about the last time you had sex with a woman?  Oh, my God.  It was great.  It was this chick.  She was so hot.  She had like blonde hair and these great tits.  And I just got to play with them and maybe like tweak their nipples a little. 
[03:17:00]  And just do all these great things to her.  And she was so into me.  Sounding a little too much like Sam.  I'm not looking at you.  Well, AJ Poopy Shits, what's happening to you?  I don't know who Sam is.  This is AJ.  And, uh...  Wow, you really sold it that time.  I don't know who Sam is.  Do you like anal with these girls?  Oh, I'll do anything with the chick. 
[03:17:30]  The chick.  What's your favorite part of a chick?  Oh.  Oh, it's the tits.  Come on.  He's kind of dancing to the music a little bit.  All right, AJ Poopy Shits.  So, uh...  That's great.  Explain this bit.  The Morningsuit bit of the day with this hot Britney Spears.  Well, I guess this bit is about...  This is, uh...  Britney Spears.  That piece of ass that she is.  Doing a commercial for Campbell's Chunky Soup. 
[03:18:00]  Chunky Soup?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like a parody, but...  I don't know why we have to sit here and talk about Soup and Britney Spears.  Let's get to the tits.  All right, let's get to the tits.  You prick.  Mm-mm, good Campbell's possibilities.  Uh, hey y'all.  It's Britney Spears for Chunky Soup.  They say Chunky fills you up, right?  And that's good, because lately I've been filled up all wrong.  By that K-Fan f***ing son of a b***h, mother f***ing. 
[03:18:30]  I hate that bitch.  F*** him, he's such a f***ing piece of white trash.  She's got it together.  Knows how to do your right.  So, anyway, Chunky Soup has a couple vitamins and minerals.  I'm not even sure what they are, but...  But then again, so does this cigarette.  Something else that tastes like cigarettes.  My ex-husband K-Fan, that motherf***ing b***h.  What a f***ing lowlife.  Leaving his children for me to take care of. 
[03:19:00]  And I don't even know what I'm doing.  And I'm hooked out on drugs and drinking alcohol and walking with those shoes on.  Chunky Soup.  My kids love it when they're drinking.  What are they drinking?  Bourbon.  I told you nothing but Chris style.  My kids are better than that, you little suds of a b***h.  Chunky Soup.  Fills your dumpy, white trash ass upright.  So you can go and strut yourself out in public, y'all.  Oh, I don't have panties on.  Mm-mm.  Good Campbell possibilities. 
[03:19:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Does anybody remember Lassie?  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Goddamn rich cunt.  That's terrific. 
[03:20:00]  That's terrific.  Wow.  And that's being played on a lot of stations, huh?  Oh, sorry.  That's good, huh?  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  Yeah, I knew that you could.  AJ Poopy Shits, what did you think of that?  Well, I mean, it was not funny.  The song was all right.  They were playing in the background.  But just, I mean, my favorite part about that, the only really redeeming quality, is you get to picture Britney Spears. 
[03:20:30]  You know what I mean?  And what, like, what would you picture about Britney?  Oh, just everything, her curves, like, that comes right up to her tits.  I just love those.  Don't you guys?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, we love tits, but AJ Poopy Shits, you say that you love tits so much, it's a little suspicious.  Because if you, if a person didn't know much about women, they probably would go for the obvious, which would be that they love tits.  What else do you like on a woman, besides the tits? 
[03:21:00]  Well, I like a woman with, like, a nice ass, or something like that.  Good thighs, pretty hair.  Like, a nice mascara, or something like that, to bring out their features.  Mascara.  Do you like, do you like their shoes?  Oh, God, if a woman is wearing awful shoes, they just have no shot with AJ.  I will tell you that right now.  All right, AJ, let me, uh, let you in on something.  Yeah.  Uh, men. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  You know, men.  Like us.  Like most of us.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Ah, we don't look at the shoes.  Really?  Nope.  You guys are missing out on a lot.  I mean.  I, I think, uh, chicks with tits buy shoes to, to, to show off to other chicks.  Yeah.  Well, that's not what I think.  They're not doing it for the men.  Ah.  Because men in general do not look at the feet unless, unless you have, like, a foot fetish or something.  Well, yeah, that's what I have.  A foot fetish. 
[03:22:00]  For chicks.  Right.  That's why I'm looking at the shoes and stuff, because I have a foot fetish.  I love women's feet in a sexual, heterosexual way.  Sexual, heterosexual way.  Well.  I gotcha.  Now, uh, AJ Poopy Shits, you're, it seems like you've banged a lot of broads.  Oh, tons.  Where's the G spot?  Oh, it's right, like, right around the pussy.  Like, right.  It's right around the pussy. 
[03:22:30]  Right, like, under it.  Okay.  What do you mean under it?  It's like, it's really hard to describe.  And I think, like, a lot of chicks, if you've been with as many chicks as me, you know that  it might vary from chick to chick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's right around the pussy area.  Mm-hmm.  Right around.  I mean, dude, if you don't know where the G spot is.  Yeah.  Then maybe you haven't been with a lot of chicks.  Oh.  And that's, to me, that's suspicious.  But I asked you first. 
[03:23:00]  I know, but what I'm saying is it's suspicious that you don't know where it is.  I know where it is.  All right, then tell us.  I told you.  It's right around that area.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but where?  Like, right around where the pussy and the clit is.  Give some advice to the guys out there.  How do they find the G spot on a woman?  And how do they work that G spot?  AJ's having a little trouble with the G spot because Sam doesn't know where it is.  I don't know who Sam is. 
[03:23:30]  People are saying, including T. Plev from Staten Island, that poopy shits, you like very large clits.  That you like extremely large clits.  Oh, sure.  The bigger, the better.  There's just more to love that way on a chick.  What's the biggest clit you've been with?  Probably eight inches, I guess.  I mean, when you've been with as many chicks, I'm saying that they will vary in size, and  I know that that sounds uncommon or whatever, but they can get that big really easily, especially 
[03:24:00]  when they're turned on.  Yeah, well, people are also saying that you like chicks and their dicks.  Dude, that's crazy because chicks don't even have dicks.  That's guys you're thinking of, and I don't like guys in that way.  No.  Convince us you don't like guys.  How do I even need to convince you?  We're just guys, being guys and talking about chicks.  I mean, that's all the convincing you need.  I like tits on chicks.  What else would I even be talking about? 
[03:24:30]  That is so gay that you guys want to even talk about this.  Whoa, whoa.  Hey, throwing that gay word around.  Well, we're guys.  We can throw around words like gay and tits.  But they don't go along with each other.  No, not really.  Gay and tits.  I know.  They're total opposites.  One is definitely not even close to the other, and I like tits.  All right.  All right.  Enough about the tits.  He likes tits.  Do you like tits or do you love them?  I love them. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  What do you do with a tit?  Oh, I'll like kind of massage it and caress it first.  And then start to like kiss it and suckle on it.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And then that really is something that gets them so turned on.  Yeah.  And then I'll like show them my stuff, you know, and then put that near their tits.  And they eat that up, huh? 
[03:25:30]  Oh, they sure do.  I mean.  Hey, AJ Poopy Shit, so what's your favorite sexual position?  Well, definitely.  I mean, it's just a bunch of guys talking, you know, guy stuff here.  Yeah, we're just talking about chicks, having sex with chicks.  I like doggy style.  Oh, yeah?  I definitely, um, from behind.  Why would you like, um, it from behind in particular?  Because.  Nothing wrong with that.  No, because that way you could reach around and grab some tits while you're going for it.  That's what I really am into.  He sure likes those tits. 
[03:26:00]  He doesn't.  But it also, when you.  What guy who doesn't, right?  That's what I'm saying.  Except one of those guys.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  But when you're doing a doggy style, it's also a way to cover up a lot of things that  you might find icky.  Like what?  Like tits?  I love them.  Tits.  Pussy.  No.  I start.  I grab all that stuff when I'm doing a doggy style.  I just reach around and grab all that stuff.  You just grab all of it.  All of it.  All of what?  I just love it.  Yeah.  All the chick stuff. 
[03:26:30]  Just the chick stuff, right?  Your voice, I got to tell you, sounds a little effeminate.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Like it sounds like a feminine voice.  Like if you were a guy that was feminine, you would talk like that.  But dude, let me tell you this.  If you can trick a chick into thinking that you're sensitive or something like that, not  that I am, but if they think you are, they will so let you see their tits so much easier. 
[03:27:00]  Really?  That's all it takes, huh?  If you can trick a chick into thinking that you really like care or whatever, and she'll  think you're sensitive, she'll let you see her tits.  So you don't try to get into their pants.  You try to see their tits.  I'm saying the tits are the first thing.  Yeah.  And then you can get into their pants later, but definitely in the same night.  Yeah.  Same night.  That's what I do, because I'm a roller.  Do you ever reach into a girl's pants and say to yourself, wow, there's something missing 
[03:27:30]  here?  Like what?  Oh, I don't know.  You know.  I've never said that, unless they don't have underpants on or something.  You never reached around and went, whoa, something's missing here.  You know what I mean?  I don't think so.  Unless, if they're not wearing underpants, I'll say wear your underpants.  But other than that, totally not.  You're like, ew, icky.  It's smooth down here.  What do you mean?  Well, yeah, I guess I do like a little more hair there.  That's my personal preference.  You like the hair around the what? 
[03:28:00]  Around the labia.  And the pussy.  Oh, so you know those areas.  Yeah.  And you don't like hair around the asshole, right?  Oh, no way.  That is gross.  But why would a chick even grow hair there, is what I'm saying.  Oh, I don't know.  Why don't you tell me, AJ, poopy shits?  Well, I don't know what kind of chicks you've been with, but the chicks I've been with are  totally not in that league.  No.  No way.  And you like big tits?  Oh, I love, I especially like big tits, but like all tits, I really love. 
[03:28:30]  I mean, to me, tits are one of the most fabulous things on this earth.  Right.  And where do you go to pick up your broads?  Oh, I'll go to like the tavern or whatever.  The tavern?  Yeah, you know.  Tavern.  Like a sports bar?  Yeah, sports bar.  I'll go to ESPN Zone.  Yeah.  Because you like sports because you're a man's man, right?  Yeah.  Sports, beer, and tits.  Totally.  You are reading my mind.  Oh, boy, I'm with you, AJ.  I like a place that has like lots of different types of beer. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  And then lots of different TV screens with different sporting matches on every one.  And you like football, right?  I love football.  What do you like about football?  Oh, just the guys passing around the pigskin like a couple of men do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, just because they're just guys being guys.  And plus, you get to see all the chicks that are so into them, which is good.  Are you a fan of the wide receivers or the tight ends? 
[03:29:30]  I guess I prefer the tight ends.  As far as football players go.  That old gag.  That old gag, indeed.  What do you guys mean?  You don't know the first thing about football.  We've talked to someone that sort of sounds like you about football, and that person didn't know shit about it.  And if we're going to be guys just hanging around talking about football and tits, you should know a little more about football.  This is my first appearance on this show, and I know football, and I know tits.  All right.  How many yards does it take for a first down in football? 
[03:30:00]  Oh, I don't pay attention to all that mumbo-jumbo technical stuff.  Leave that for the bookworms.  You know what I mean?  Well, what do you like about football, then?  Just get to see.  Well, one thing that I like about football is the friggin' cheerleaders.  Yeah?  And they have short skirts on, and the only thing better than their pom-poms is their tits.  And sometimes, sometimes if I'm just hanging out with the guys, I'll say, check out the pom-poms on her, if you know what I mean.  And you mean, by pom-poms, of course, you don't.  I mean, I'm talking about tits. 
[03:30:30]  Right.  It's just like a jokey thing we do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some people are saying he's at his best.  He what?  Ah.  He what?  Rich.  What?  Saying Rich is at his best right now.  Oh, I know.  Oh.  Wow.  Which one is it?  What?  Shouldn't we be wrapping this up?  Damn. 
[03:31:00]  I mean, how long was he going to do that thing for?  The tit thing.  Wasn't that going for a while?  Oh, shit.  How asleep were you?  Oh, man.  I didn't sleep last night.  I can't even believe I held out this long.  I got to go to a big meeting from here.  I'm doomed.  What am I going to do?  I got a big meeting.  Oh, man.  I can't do this.  Oh, man.  Are you still asleep?  No.  Yeah.  You're just like Seinfeld.  I'm sure Seinfeld takes a nice little nap before his big meetings, too. 
[03:31:30]  Doing a little call back to a couple hours ago.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I'm good.  I just kind of dozed off for a second.  I was dreaming about Scranton this weekend.  Wisecrackers.  We were having a good interview with AJ Poopy Shits.  I don't know where he went.  Sam, where did AJ Poopy Shits go?  I don't know.  He had to take off.  He's at Sam on his way out.  There's a man sitting here.  Wow.  Now we got a real man in front of us.  Sam, what do you think of that AJ Poopy Shits guy? 
[03:32:00]  He seems kind of gay.  Doesn't he?  Yeah, he seems like he's covering up all that stuff.  Yeah, doesn't he?  Yeah.  That's what I was thinking.  Yeah.  I mean, I can't stand him.  Ron Paul.  What?  Who's Ron Paul?  Oh.  All right.  Picking up support, though.  I think Tuesday Wells is...  Ron Paul is the goof...  He's the goof...  The goof...  Goof candidate.  Hey, thank you, Sam.  Thank you, AJ Poopy Shits.  Thank you, Rich Voss.  Yes.  Thanks. 
[03:32:30]  We got to get into line of the day, huh?  Indeed.  Line of the day.  Brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  Free live scoring stats, bios, and news that will help you win big this season in fantasy  football.  Right?  AJ Poopy Shits?  You know it.  It's all at BodogFantasy.net.  We got a runner-up line of the day right here.  Let's go to Rich in Bohemia. 
[03:33:00]  Rich?  Hey, good night.  Hey.  Today I learned that a perfect game can be ruined by a bunt.  Very good.  Yeah.  Listener getting in there.  And he wrecked it, man.  We really were feeling good about the show today.  We definitely picked it back up, though.  Hell, fuck it.  Say that.  Fucking AJ Poopy Shits.  I like AJ Poopy Shits.  Please.  Scratch the surface.  Enough said.  You're going to come in with a...  Well, I mean, Sam, when you see AJ Poopy Shits...  Maybe you could tell him, wink, wink, nudge, nudge... 
[03:33:30]  I don't know what you're doing there.  ...that he could do a whole, like, you know, like a whole thing on hot chicks in pop culture.  All right.  Maybe his assignment is who he finds hot on TV and in pop culture.  I don't know why you guys give this guy so much air time.  All right.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  When the president jogs around the White House, that's presidential hack.  Oh, the jog.  Well, any jog that he takes with the Secret Service is hackery. 
[03:34:00]  When he drives through Dallas just to get his head blown off, it's hackery.  That's such hack.  That's a hack.  Very good.  Logan wants us to call him at his office.  What?  That was to communicate the king.  When?  And he wants us to wrap up.  Right now?  Which we are, anyway.  Bryce Dunnopony.  Board on Fantasy.net, here's another runner-up line of the day.  When the hell were you at a Baptist ceremony?  A few times, man.  I check out stuff. 
[03:34:30]  That must have just...  Dude, they're hollering and singing.  Woo!  Their hands are shaking in the air.  Yeah, this is it right here.  That must have looked like, here's Waldo.  Ah, look at that.  That's the runner-up.  Is that all the runner-ups?  Yes.  Gee, I wonder what line of the day is going to be.  I so win today.  I actually miss it.  I just heard everybody laughing.  It was a classic.  I'm very excited to hear it. 
[03:35:00]  Yes.  I get to hit another Dave Kingman home run today.  Not many, but when I hit them, they're breaking windows in the parking lot.  BodogFantasy.net, thank you.  So here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I just love when people throw this out, like people that were alive like hundreds of years ago, 
[03:35:30]  and it's like, wait a minute.  How do you know?  He certainly wasn't a practicing homo, because he spent, what, 10 years on his back.  Yeah.  You should have had.  At some point, you've got to roll over.  If he was a homo, he would have painted the floor.  And it ends with crotch shock.  All right. 
[03:36:00]  Nice.  Uh-oh.  What is that?  Is he calling right now?  What does he want?  What the hell?  What?  What?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I was just calling.  Check one, two.  What?  You really want me to read this?  Yeah, please.  Uh, LOL.  LOL.  I was just calling you.  No need for ant.  But tell Vos to go screw.  Oh.  He doesn't say that.  Oh, yeah, it does.  Fuck him. 
[03:36:30]  Hold the fucking phone.  All right.  Do I know him?  Mm-hmm.  He ain't going to give you a job.  That's all right.  He knows me.  That's good enough.  He barely knows you.  Oh, they know me.  I fucking do.  Please.  Actually, the part I left out, because I wanted to cause trouble, I was just calling you to  catch up.  What?  Are you calling him?  No shit.  All right.  I'm going to call him, too.  No, not at the same time.  Ring, goddammit. 
[03:37:00]  There it is.  I'm calling him, too.  Eric?  Hello?  Hello?  Hey.  How you doing, Eric Logan?  Why wouldn't you want to talk to me?  I do.  I was returning Opie's call.  You said no need for Anthony to call?  Just talking to you?  No, no, no.  You can always call.  I can.  No, no.  I was returning to his call.  I can call is different than no need for me to call. 
[03:37:30]  There's no need for you to stick around, because I know how you like to leave.  This is not, it's not mission critical.  There's no issues.  But if it's talking with Elo, I haven't spoken with you in a while.  I figured, you know, if you call up, perhaps, you know, you'd want to talk with me.  I would like, I was returning Opie's call from earlier this morning.  That's all.  Fuck you.  Hey, what happened?  I just hung up on him.  Oh.  That's all.  Tell him I'll be screwing myself up. 
[03:38:00]  I'm going to screw myself right now, Mr. Logan.  I'm going to call him back.  That's it.  You call.  We'll play bad cop, worse cop.  I like Eric Logan.  He knows that.  Why?  I can pick up.  Hello?  Why didn't, uh, why didn't you want to talk to Anthony? 
[03:38:30]  Well, there's a few things I need to address personally.  Shut up.  That's not true.  That's not true.  But the part about telling Vos to go screw, I mean, I meant that part.  Okay.  Yeah, Vos wasn't too good on the show today, huh?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  What's wrong with you?  Over.  Are you crazy for 10 minutes?  I, I, I, I take a little nap.  Shut up.  Is he telling me to shut up?  He's playing a sound machine?  Yeah.  Oh.  First of all, Vos, you fell asleep on the air. 
[03:39:00]  That's never good.  First of all, why does a Vos have a sound machine?  I know.  He's crazy.  It's in his office.  Yeah.  He holds meetings and hits the sound machine.  He's got one just like we got with all the sounds in it.  Hey, Elo.  Hey, buddy.  Do you like AJ Poopy shits?  Well, not our new character, but a new character of the show?  What was that?  What did he play?  Sound effects aren't playing.  He's like fucking Willy Wonka.  I think that's the car crash with the no pursuing it. 
[03:39:30]  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess he didn't like it.  You don't like AJ Poopy shits?  Yeah, it was okay.  The G-spot part was actually pretty helpful and informative to me, actually.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I see AJ kind of working his way toward the Fan and Sam show.  There's a great show on 202 that appears very infrequently.  On Saturday nights.  Yes.  He's got a lot of seven listeners.  We were going to move AJ Poopy as to. 
[03:40:00]  Elo?  What do you got on the merger?  He cleaned it up.  I got nothing.  Seriously?  I got nothing.  No.  Are we going to be part of that great programming that Gary Parsons was quoted as saying today?  Absolutely.  Oh.  Bank on it?  I would bank on it.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Now he's banking on it.  Are you going to be part of the new company?  No one said anything to me.  But they realize.  But they realize.  It's my goal to be here. 
[03:40:30]  But they realize how important you are to our success, right?  Yeah.  And to.  Now, listen.  You guys are important to your own success.  And to.  No, I think.  Oh, look at them separating.  What's that about?  Oh, boy.  What happened to us all sticking together?  That's not good.  I heard some separation in there.  Where the fuck are you going?  And can we go with you?  You may not want to be aligned to me, though.  What?  Well.  Where are we aligned?  No, no, no.  We're in this thing together.  Yeah.  We're.  I mean.  We're.  Come on.  We're in the trenches together here. 
[03:41:00]  Until if you get the boot.  Regardless of what Maneli says on this stupid radio board thing.  Well, let me tell you something about Eric Logan.  And I'll say it this way.  Mm-hmm.  One of the very, very few people that ever got us.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And I say it that way today because I don't feel like taking any phone calls this afternoon.  See?  I'm getting smarter, Anthony.  And that's why you need to continue with us.  You keep me sane, and you get the program. 
[03:41:30]  If Eric Logan keeps Opie sane.  Eric, you gotta do a better job.  Nah, I would have fucked this up a long time ago if it wasn't for Eric Logan.  That's true.  Really?  Yeah.  We've had so many people that just never got us.  But Eric Logan's one of those people that get us.  Okay.  So who do we need now?  Hey, I'm gonna get you a list of people. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  All right, Eric.  You continue the show.  We gotta pack up.  So the cell phone is on the mic.  He's just laying the cell phone on the microphone.  All these satellites and stuff, but all right.  It's just going through a cell phone on the mic.  Look, everyone say hi to the Eric.  Uh-oh.  Eric, you still there?  Ouch.  You still there?  Okay.  I'm propping my cell phone on the mic.  That represents you.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Eric Logan show.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right. 
[03:42:30]  I would like to, first of all, let all of our fans know that we've got some terrific programming over on this great new channel called XMX.  It's really cool.  Today, we've got Bob Dylan in the theme time radio hour where he talks.  And then on Channel 3, we translate what Bob Dylan says. 
[03:43:00]  All right.  This weekend, we've got some exciting college football with the Big 12 championship, the SEC, and another championship game.  We've got that.  Let's see.  We have that home plate thing happening with baseball where the Yankees are going to get Johan Santana.  We're following that trade information.  Christmas channels.  And don't ever forget that yesterday was the exciting premiere of the Commissioner Bettman show on home ice where it was fantastic. 
[03:43:30]  The first time ever a major league commissioner was, hello, major league commissioner went to the show, which was very exciting.  That's on home ice for those of you who are of the hockey kind.  That's 204.  It's a great new studio over there that we ought to stay in mind having the boys go over and do a show so long as Rich Voss doesn't show up.  And we also have some great country channels. 
[03:44:00]  And we have the ground operatives on last night.  It's fantastic.  I think that that's it.  Let's see.  What time is it?  It's 10.59.  So I've got another minute to kill.  Another 200 channels for that.  What else do we got?  I'm with Don Wickland, who's in my office right now.  He's actually massaging my feet, which feels quite good.  And...  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  Oh, how can we forget about the Christmas channels? 
[03:44:30]  Boring.  That's very exciting.  Boring.  We're doing it.  Radio Hanukkah is starting next week.  Okay, terrific.  Does anybody remember Lafkin?  I get nothing.  He's a fag.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah. 
[03:45:00]  Hello, exactly!  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  No, he didn't hang up. 
[03:45:30]  He's still there.  I hear him.  If you listen real closely, you can hear cock sucking going on us. 
[03:46:00]  Listen, you can hear it.  Right there.  Did he hear it?  Did he hear it?  I didn't hear that.  Ding dong!  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Anybody else in here?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  What's your name? 
[03:46:30]  Where are you from?  New York.  What are you into?  You know, just hanging out and talking.  Same here.  Um, where are you from?  Are you a big fella?  I've been told.  How big?  Big, big enough.  Yeah?  Hello?  I think I heard someone else pop in the room.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, guys. 
[03:47:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, oh.  Hello?  That's it.  Hello?  Hello?  Someone else is in the room.  It's my first time here.  Uh, what's, uh, what's your name?  My name is...  Slickard.  Uh, where are you from?  Yeah.  Hey, wait.  You hung?  Somebody else is in here.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Is that A.J. Poopy Shits?  A.J.  A.J. Poopy Shits? 
[03:47:30]  What's up, guys?  What are you doing in here?  Hello?  We heard you on the O.P. and Anthony show today.  You did a great job.  Thanks so much.  You did a great job faking it today.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Do you think they're onto me?  I like how you talked about tits.  Those disgusting things on women.  I know.  Those icky things called tits.  Ugh.  Yuck.  Who would like touching those?  Straight guys are so easy to fool, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  They're easy to turn out, too.  Hello?  Fucking rich. 
[03:48:00]  Fucking rich.  Douchebag.  That's just disturbing.  I can't...  You notice how no one can look...  Ow!  Oh, there goes the Elo phone.  You notice how no one can look at each other while we're doing that bit?  Like, my head's turned this way.  Opie's looking up at the lights.  That's horrible.  And for the people to go, that sounds a little too real.  Yes.  And I heard that on his fucking...  On the scanner once.  On the scanner once.  I was going through the scanner on the cell phones and mobile phones and whatnot, and 
[03:48:30]  we heard that as an actual room.  I got some food for your bitch head, bitch.  Why are you coming home?  Five in the morning.  Something's going on.  Can I smell your dick?  Blame it like a fool, cause that ain't who.  So what you need to do is let me smell your dick.  Why are you coming home?  Five in the morning.  Something's going on.  Can I smell your dick? 
[03:49:00]  Don't blame me like a fool, cause that ain't who.  So what you need to do is let me smell your dick.  It's four o'clock and I'm sleeping.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's how we end today, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks, Rich.  Wisecrackers and Scranton, PA, right?  Friday and Saturday?  And AJ Poopy Shits, we'll be hearing from you.  Yeah, of course.  Hopefully tomorrow.  Why wouldn't we?  Everybody out there, thank you.  Ranafez, noon to three. 
[03:49:30]  Yes.  For the illiterate and ignorant, this is dangerous propaganda.  For being happening. </pre>
