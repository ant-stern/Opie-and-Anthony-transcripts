<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a fiery discussion about the alleged assault of a white female co-worker, Camille Davis, by a Columbia University professor, Lionel McIntyre, during a debate on white privilege.  The hosts and callers expressed outrage at the NYPD's failure to charge McIntyre with a hate crime, contrasting this with the media's extensive coverage of similar incidents involving white perpetrators.  The conversation devolved into a highly offensive and racially charged debate about race relations, media bias, and the perceived hypocrisy of political correctness and white guilt. Callers, including a black man sharing his experiences with racial bias and a police officer offering a possible explanation for the lack of hate crime charges, contributed to the heated exchange.  A Columbia alumnus detailed experiences with institutional racism at the university. The discussion touched upon the legacy of slavery and its ongoing impact on race relations, often referencing previous controversial incidents, including those involving Don Imus. The segment frequently used highly offensive and racial slurs.

The show then transitioned to a graphic discussion of Oprah Winfrey's interview with a woman severely maimed by a chimpanzee attack.  The hosts and callers described the woman's injuries in explicit detail, focusing on her facial disfigurement and the loss of her hands and eyes,  interspersing their morbid fascination with dark humor and circus music.  They also debated the ethical implications of broadcasting such graphic details. A caller shared their experiences as a white teacher in a predominantly Black school, touching upon class divisions within the Black community and differing perceptions of racial slurs.  This was followed by a discussion about a 12-year-old girl who sneezes excessively (10,000-12,000 times a day), punctuated by audio clips of her sneezing and speculation about the cause, ranging from psychological issues to a traumatic event. The intern's performance in handling calls was criticized for its slowness and inefficiency.

Next, Mary Weiland, Scott Weiland's ex-wife, joined the show to promote her memoir, "Rock and Roll and Mental Illness" (alternatively mentioned as "Fault to Pieces").  The conversation covered her struggles with bipolar disorder and heroin addiction, her tumultuous relationship with Scott Weiland, including incidents of his heroin use and her manic episodes, and the challenges of raising children in such an environment.  She detailed her experiences with "speedballing" and a harrowing encounter with police while needing Gatorade. The interview included frank discussions of drug use, mental illness, her childhood, her life with Scott Weiland (including his time with Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver), and her post-addiction life and dating experiences.  The discussion was often interrupted by off-color jokes and humorous banter.

Following Weiland, adult film star Belladonna entered the studio. The conversation shifted to her career, drug use in the adult film industry, the changing industry landscape due to political correctness, and her upbringing as a Mormon.  A detailed and explicit discussion ensued about her first pornographic film, including her first experience with anal sex, interspersed with clips from her films.  A listener's brother-in-law's requests were relayed to Belladonna, leading to humorous interactions.  "Big A," a large fan, also participated in the conversation.  The discussion also included graphic descriptions of a double-hand fisting scene from one of Belladonna's films, exploring techniques, sensations, and reactions.  Big A, the intern, engaged in a role-playing exercise creating a pornographic script with Belladonna, leading to more explicit dialogue.  The segment also touched upon legal aspects of the pornography industry, particularly regarding the distribution of fisting content, and answered callers' questions ranging from advice on anal sex to personal anecdotes about Belladonna's career and life, including her pregnancy and experiences filming while pregnant.  The segment concluded with promotional information for Belladonna's appearances and website, and a mention that Colin Quinn and Patrice O'Neill would be guests the following day.  Throughout the entire segment with Belladonna, explicit language and sexually suggestive content were prevalent.

[00:00:00]  We'll be in Anthony, are no strangers to scandal.  We'll be in Anthony on Satellite Radio.  Host Anthony Camilla and Greg Colby.  Autovercial team.  Good comment.  Profanity.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony apologizing for yet another raunchy gag.  We'll be in Anthony's show.  We'll be in Anthony.  Who's this the last straw for the raunchy radio duo?  The raunchy radio duo?  Disturbed and deviant.  There's nothing I enjoy more than drunken teen girls.  The history of misogynistic behavior. 
[00:00:30]  The home of incest and anal sex.  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.  I am a fucking lunatic.  That's shocking.  I love it!  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show.  Best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day.  What are we going to do?  Best of our abilities or a good show?  This is what the show is.  It's silly.  It's stupid.  Whatever you want to call it, listen to it and like it or don't.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  All right, there's controversy.  What's going on in the studio this morning here with this, uh, is it a Columbia professor,  right?  It's a nut.  I mean, Jimmy is, uh, enraged.  It's just, it's insane.  It's fucking, it's...  I didn't read the story in the paper, so I have no idea what you're talking about.  No one did.  It's not in the paper.  No one did.  It's not there.  So, where did you hear about this?  The New York Post online.  There's a Columbia University professor, black professor, who was having a race relations  argument with a white woman. 
[00:01:30]  I think she works at the university.  A discussion at first.  So, an argument makes it sound like it was violent right from the get-go, or there was  some kind of thing.  They were having a race relations discussion at a bar, and, uh, yeah, things got a little  wily, I guess.  He, uh, he punched the woman in the face.  Yeah.  In the bar?  In the bar.  He punched her in the face.  Um, at least that's what it said online.  She'll be appearing on...  Allegedly, I should say.  Will she be appearing on Oprah?  Oh. 
[00:02:00]  Why?  Wow.  She could be.  Police busted, uh, Lionel McIntyre for assault after his bruised victim, Camille Davis, filed  charges.  Yeah.  Um, the professor, who's black, has been engaged in a fiery discussion about white privilege  with Davis, who is white, and another male guest, who is also white.  So, two white people were having a discussion with this black professor about white privilege.  And, um, he shoved Davis, who's the woman, and then, uh, when the other patron and a  bar employee tried to break up the shoving match, I guess, so the professor slugged her 
[00:02:30]  in the face.  And it said the punch was so loud, the kitchen workers in the back heard it over the noise.  The other patron involved in the dispute said McIntyre took a swing at him after he yelled,  you don't hit a woman.  Yeah.  Black professor punches a white lady in the fucking face, and the other guy yells, you don't  hit a woman, so he punches that guy in the face, or he swings at him.  He knocked the glasses right off my face, said the man.  And his shoes. 
[00:03:00]  And my shoes.  Who would only give his first name is Shannon.  Uh, the punch came out of nowhere.  Mac, who's the black professor, was talking to us about white privilege, and what was I  doing about it?  Apparently, I wasn't doing enough.  Yeah, it's Columbia University.  Jesus Christ.  And here's the problem.  Fuck would you send your kids there?  He was arrested, of course.  Mm.  Uh.  Outrage.  It's not in the New York Post.  Mm-hmm.  And it's not in the Daily News.  No. 
[00:03:30]  Fucking ponderous.  Why isn't that story in the two major papers in New York City?  I think it was a black Columbia professor when she found a noose in her office, which  is, you know, a symbol of black lynchings.  It was, I want to say front page news.  It was close.  It was.  It was right there.  Major news, big story, both New York papers.  And then we just read that the New York Police Department is not charging him with a hate 
[00:04:00]  crime.  Why would you?  Yeah, why?  They're arguing race, black professor punches a white co-worker in the face, and he will  not be charged with a hate crime.  Based on a racial discussion, he punches her in the face.  Yeah, why are they saying it's not a hate crime?  Because, uh.  They give a reason?  Because blacks, uh, do not get charged with hate crimes.  I understand that, but what do they say?  Do they give a reason?  I don't know if they've given a reason.  They're charging him with assault.  I guarantee what they're going to say is that it was alcohol-fueled and the subject matter  didn't marry.  They're going to give some bullshit. 
[00:04:30]  What the fuck is the NYPD doing?  If it was the other way around, and, uh, you know, they were having a discussion, the  same discussion, a white guy punched a black lady in the face, uh, he would so be charged.  Can you imagine a white professor punching a black female co-worker in the fucking face  in a bar?  Over a racial discussion, yeah.  Over a racial discussion?  Whoa!  It would be headline news.  Yes.  Front page, uh, for days on end, there'd be outrage, there'd be calls, calls for him to 
[00:05:00]  be fired, there'd be, where's the, where's the outrage for this guy?  I say this guy should be fired.  If he's, if he's, he's a violent man, he obviously showed violent tendencies, and should  not be a professor at a university.  Uh, that, that when, when you're, you're holding a discussion with somebody about something,  you don't resort to punching them in the face.  Is, is he going to be charged with anything?  Of assault.  Assault, please.  And I read some other fucking black scholar wrote an article, you know, one of these other  fucking, uh, uh, uh, apologists, and he, he wrote an article, he goes, well, you should 
[00:05:30]  never punch anyone, but, you know, and then the whole article became about, uh, white...  Ah, slab-a-bitch!  But then the whole article became about, uh, white privilege, and what it's like in academia  to deal with that.  Not, this guy punched this woman in the face.  It's, it's amazing how people apologize for and excuse, and if, by the way, it's the second  case of a racial incident involving, uh, a black professor at a major, uh, intellectual 
[00:06:00]  university, I mean, intellectual Ivy League, uh, school here, which is Harvard, which was  the, uh, the professor in Boston, and Columbia, two of the most prestigious schools in the  country, both guys, uh, uh, are arrested, one guy for throwing a punch at a woman and  one guy for overreacting with the police, and no one makes a connection.  Again, reverse it.  Two white professors, both having racial incidents, one with a black female police officer, and  one punching a black woman in the face, and all the papers will be talking about what's  going on in academia, where there's this, this outrage by white professors against black 
[00:06:30]  students, that's all you'd fucking hear about.  I can only imagine what kind of shit these universities are pumping out.  What kind of shit fucking Americans these universities are pumping out with the likes  of this cocksucker fucking, uh, uh, teaching them.  Does any, where's the women's groups?  Yeah, yeah, where, where's the national organization?  Well, this just happened, right?  But it happened like two days ago, I think.  Two days ago?  Yeah, or a day and a half ago, I think.  It just happened, a week from now, a month from now, you, the story's buried on the 
[00:07:00]  internet, it's not even in the papers, it's on, this won't, this won't get any attention.  It's not on, it's not on the fucking front, they're talking about Madoff's mansion, discounted,  it's not on any of the major, the networks, even Fox, and Drudge has it, but they don't  even address it.  What is this fucking terror?  What is this terror of calling a black intellectual a racist?  Yeah.  Or a guy who should be charged with a hate crime, because that's obviously what his motivation  was.  Exactly.  Where is that, where is it?  It's like people think we're like broken records, but it drives me nuts, because it's a, we 
[00:07:30]  are fired.  If in an argument.  Oh yeah, yeah.  You were to say something harsh, I mean on satellite it'd be a lot harder, but if you  were to argue and call a black guy a nigger in an argument and you meant it, it wasn't  being funny, it was being angry.  You're gone.  And he protested, the fucking company would fire you.  Right.  They would say that that's uncomfortable working, but whatever they would call it.  Yeah.  And the fucking media doesn't cover this.  But this guy who was employed at Columbia University punches a woman in the face and  he'll, he'll keep his job. 
[00:08:00]  He'll keep his job.  How, how does that not on the first, I can't understand, or there's other stuff on the  front page.  How is that not in the first three or four pages of the New York Post?  Or Fat Nick, that white guy in, uh, in whatever it was, the three black guys went to steal  the cars out of Howard Beach.  Right, right.  And the three white guys, they were all kind of thugs, they fought and, and, and they hit  the black guy with a bat who was going there to steal cars.  Yeah.  He literally, what was, how many of your days was he on the front page?  I mean, was it fucking 10 days in a row it was front page news?  Yeah, it was, it was on the front page for a while. 
[00:08:30]  The guys were admittedly there to steal cars in the neighborhood.  And, uh, Fat Nick and his buddies, uh, got baseball bats and racked their heads.  You know, crooks lose, uh, uh, fat guineas, uh, score them, uh, one point.  Yeah.  But, uh, it was considered a hate crime and he went to jail based on the hate crime more  than the assault itself.  And, uh, for that, I mean, you, you actually have a reason.  Hey, these guys are fucking in, in town, uh, robbing, uh, stealing cars.  The, just the insanity of the NYPD to whoever is running NY, the NYPD brass are a bunch 
[00:09:00]  of dummies.  It's probably not the, the, the foot, the foot patrol cops.  It's not them, no, no, no, no.  It's the, it's the higher ups.  But is there anybody that works at NYPD can explain why is this guy not being charged  with a fucking hate crime and going to jail for it?  Yeah.  Let's, uh, try to get some NYPD on the phone.  The, the, the fucking, uh, uh, attorney general has stated that there, you can't, you can't,  uh, be black and, and be charged with a hate crime. 
[00:09:30]  Let's say that power base in order to do it.  Really?  Is that what he really said?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that what Eric Holder said?  Yeah.  And that's dummy.  Yeah.  He's another fucking asshole.  That's the same guy, by the way, that said America is, this is where black intellectuals  and I would love somebody, a black intellectual to call up.  Not that I didn't enjoy our show, but he said that America is afraid to have honest racial  discussions.  I guess they were having one.  And look what happened.  Yeah.  You motherfucker.  You motherfucker, Americans are not afraid to have honest racial discussions.  White people don't have them. 
[00:10:00]  And this is, again, I blame white people for this.  Where are white people being angry?  Most of these reporters, the people who run the papers are not black.  They're not black people squashing this.  It's a bunch of fucking privileged, guilty white people.  Let's go to Bill in Arizona.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, yeah, there's a movie, Anthony.  It's perfect for you.  It's called Indoctrinate You.  So, story out of this particular movie, a kid at one of these Ivy League schools was passing  around a bunch of hate-filled slurs and stuff towards a particular individual. 
[00:10:30]  He got a slap on the wrist.  Now, you have another story where a guy invites a Republican speaker who happens to be black  to the school to do a, you know, something on his book.  The name of the book was Get Off the Plantation.  They tried to run this poor kid out of school, expelled him, everything else.  The liberal left is insane when it comes to these colleges. 
[00:11:00]  But, dude, it's really, it's like, I know I want to be wrong.  It's like, I don't want to say the same shit over and over again.  But it just keeps happening.  I can't understand it.  I feel like I'm screaming and no sound is coming out.  That people don't see, and I don't feel like white people are victims either.  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying whites are victims or, oh, we have a tough in this country.  I am talking about the fucking media who are the ones who are reported or the NYPD are  not charging this guy with a hate crime.  This perception of race and this phoniness. 
[00:11:30]  Politically correct people are not being politically correct because they're afraid of being misconstrued  as racist.  They're politically correct because they're afraid of being exposed as racist.  It's a way of building a wall around so you don't slip and say the wrong thing and you  don't say what's really on your mind.  Politically correct people are fucking, are really despicable.  People are saying that this.  Unfortunately, the indoctrination is, I mean, it's even starting with, I can see my 10-year-old  right now.  The indoctrination is already starting.  Of course it is.  And eventually what's going to end up happening is, when it comes to conservatism, it's going 
[00:12:00]  to disappear.  This is not even about conservatism.  Well, Matt, a few people are saying that this story was in the Post and the Times yesterday.  But where is it today?  I didn't see it.  I don't remember seeing it.  I'm just throwing that out there for the discussion.  That's all.  If it's in yesterday's Post, if we could have a copy of it, I would love to see where it  was.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We should have seen it on one of the, you know, front pages or one of the important  pages.  And where is it today?  How is it only in one day?  If this was a white guy, again, we would be having the fired, fired, so completely fired 
[00:12:30]  talk right now.  Of course.  But now I'm saying so completely not fired, this guy will be fine.  Let's go to Mike in Buffalo.  Mike.  Gentlemen, what's happening this morning?  Hi, Mike.  All right.  Listen, hey, Jimmy, by the way, man, you said nigger with absolute perfection.  I'm proud of you, man.  Thank you.  You said Anthony on that tip.  But I wasn't saying that, you know that.  Jimmy, I know that.  I love you, man.  You know, I'm sorry I missed you in Buffalo, too, by the way, man.  But anyway.  What happened?  You should have been there. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, I know.  I was getting high somewhere.  You know what I'm saying.  But yeah, like I said, man, I think the white guilt of the media and society as a whole  has made everyone go into this turtle shell, man, and it's pathetic.  You know what I mean?  And it's like the Dave Chappelle's kid he did about, like, the news really being reported  like it should be.  You know what I mean?  You guys ever seen that one?  No.  They were actually saying, like, you know, today's niggers are robbers.  I mean, it's just, you know, we need to get to that, basically, because people are so 
[00:13:30]  shell-shocked about saying something or stepping on somebody's toes.  And, you know, it's just pathetic now, man.  It really is.  Are you a black man?  No, I'm a brother, man, all day long.  I can't fan white people, but nevertheless.  I don't blame you.  They're enraging.  No, man.  But, I mean, it's like, that's just not how I was raised, man.  I mean, I was always taught to just speak the truth, regardless of what it is, man.  And, like I said, I'm not going to sound stereotypical.  I've got white friends, but I do.  You know, and we all come from the same, pretty much the same vibe, man. 
[00:14:00]  We understand.  It's such a chicken-shit society now, man.  Yeah.  That, you know, you can't say and do what you really feel because you belong for it.  Do you feel like, as a black guy, do you feel the guy, there was a call the other day  who said that you feel people trying to not antagonize you?  And as a black guy, do you reckon, I mean, I'm white, so I know the way white people think.  Do you recognize that as, like, because white people think they're being very slick when  they're very politically correct and they say the right thing and they're paternalistic. 
[00:14:30]  Do you at least recognize that as a guy who is really a racist and who really is talking  down, like, who is, I mean, is it that obvious to black people, too, as it is to me?  Well, you know, it's obvious to black people who know what to look for.  You know what I mean?  It's like anything else, man.  I mean, like I said, you can tell, you know, the old adage is not what you say, it's how  you say it.  You know what I mean?  If you're observant enough to sit there and go, oh, this white motherfucker's insulting  me.  You know what I mean?  You can pick up on that.  Oh, this black motherfucker's insulting me.  It is what it is.  But nevertheless, yeah, Jimmy, I do feel that. 
[00:15:00]  Like with Anthony, whenever he says something, he insults me.  But I know that's what he's going for.  You know what?  Yeah, I would rather, you know, this is something, I base things on, a lot of times on how I would  like to be treated.  I would so much rather be treated like have somebody come up to me and just say, hey,  I fucking don't like you than have somebody come up to me and go like, I don't like you  and I'm going to coddle you because you really can't take care of yourself and I'm here to 
[00:15:30]  help you.  I'd rather just have somebody go, go fuck yourself, you know?  And you try.  I mean, and that's the way it should be because you're talking about, I mean, regardless of  where black people come from, I respect the old black people, the old white people from  the South.  You know what I mean?  Because if you tell me you don't like niggas, I know I don't need to be around you.  You know what I mean?  It's true.  Makes sense.  You know what I mean?  Straight up.  You got people that, like you said, that'll slick you and think they're being PC, but the  whole time they're insulting you, man, if you have your brains and catching on with that. 
[00:16:00]  Looking down on you, yep.  Well, there are people who are afraid.  It's a really weird thing, like with the word African-American and black.  Like, white people very rarely know which one to use when, and I don't think black people  really care that much.  They just think it's kind of fun to watch us be uncomfortable.  We don't know exactly, but there's almost a weird white people that won't say black  or that struggle with it.  It's almost like they're afraid that when the word comes out, the way they feel about  that word is going to be revealed.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I dig what you're saying. 
[00:16:30]  Me, personally, I prefer black.  I mean, I'm really around the same age, me and you, and that's what I was raised up saying.  And African-American shit is crap.  Matter of fact, I got an African friend I went to college with, and that dude said  they hate the fact that we use African-Americans.  And they really don't even consider us, you know, African-Americans.  You can't even sound, you can't sound badass with African-Americans.  It's like, years ago, I'm a proud black man.  And it's like, that sounds like black, black power, motherfucker.  And plus, how turned on can I get telling my girlfriend to talk about sucking African-American 
[00:17:00]  dicks?  That's not sexy.  If I seen a porn that said, white dicks, African-American dicks, it wouldn't have the same oomph.  And Mike, where are we at with colored?  Where are we at with the word colored, by the way?  Oh yeah, I had a friend, this is a young dude, man.  He's in his maybe 30s that I work with.  He actually said that, man.  He goes, yeah, man, we went to the strip club back then, and my buddy was really digging 
[00:17:30]  the color girl.  I said, color girl?  What year is this?  Jesus.  What is this, 1952, motherfucker?  Well, that's like when we hear honky, we're like, oh my God.  What year are we in, man?  That wasn't even a good word when it was being used.  It was never that impressive, but still.  It was almost cute.  Like they were using it on the Jeffersons.  Crack is good.  I never understood the connection.  You know what I mean?  I can't remember.  I think it was Louis C.K. was on your show one time. 
[00:18:00]  This is the kind of brother I am.  I like funny shit across the board.  I don't care if it's about black people.  I don't care.  Louis C.K. said to Patrice, you know how they came up with the word nigger.  That is.  Black guy acting like what?  That was the funniest shit I ever heard.  Have we ever played that?  That was one of those.  I think that was one of those.  We played it a lot in the back office.  Why don't we play it?  I think that was one of the things that was kind of banned.  We got paranoid.  We got paranoid.  We got paranoid on the show.  Well, you know what it was, Mike?  The show got paranoid after Imus got dumped. 
[00:18:30]  We had, and then Hugh Pinero, one of us, fired for that Condi Rice thing.  We got a little bit paranoid.  We had no faith that the company would protect us.  And this is before the merger, even.  We just were afraid that anything racial.  Yeah, so we took out a few things that could be a problem.  I heard that.  I heard that one.  We actually protected ourselves for once.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, that's cool.  Like I said, man, I was...  Well, can we play it again now?  Mike, hold on, Mike.  This hasn't been played in a few... 
[00:19:00]  I was actually not hearing the...  I heard about the bit, and I've heard the bit.  This was January 2007.  Yeah, this hasn't been played in two years, easily.  Easily two years.  Is this where the nigger came from?  Originally?  There was some black guy being a nigger.  And so they called him a nigger.  Jesus.  He was being a real nigger, and somebody said, what a nigger.  And that's where it started.  It just was a...  Nigger was a feeling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just like, this...  Yeah, it wasn't some wordplay.  He was blurting out a sound, and it came out like that. 
[00:19:30]  Just the guy was being such a nigger.  That he fucking made someone say the word.  Fucking Louie, man.  And that was...  There you go, Mike.  Christ.  And Patrice is one of those guys that's like, he's impossible to offend.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's also brutal.  Like, Patrice is not the black guy that sits in the room and just enjoys the white folks.  Patrice loves making white people uncomfortable.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No doubt about it.  And I'm the same way, man.  But it's all done out of fun to me.  It's not malicious.  Right. 
[00:20:00]  It's nothing.  You know what I mean?  I constantly pick on white people in the break room to where I'm the only person in there.  So I think it's beautiful that I take all the white people away.  But, Mike, you said you do it in fun and it's not malicious.  That's exactly what Imus was doing.  It doesn't even matter.  It doesn't even matter.  You mean to be having a good time and you're not being malicious.  You still get knocked down.  The problem with Imus was, you know, it's such...  I mean, it's so much discrimination in this country.  It was an age discrimination against him.  It was just an old white dude thinking he was trying to be hip or some shit. 
[00:20:30]  And it fell on his face.  Well, people saw the cowboy hat, too.  They saw the cowboy hat and that represented something.  And they thought, like, oh, this guy's terrible.  People didn't even know it.  Well, he does look the part.  But the problem the media had was they never really expressed the fact that it was done on a comedy show and meant to entertain people.  You know, a lot of people thought he really was trying to be malicious and mean with that statement.  To tell you the truth, it was a lot of black girls that were trying to achieve something. 
[00:21:00]  And I think they looked at that as a very horrible thing.  If he would have said that about some fucking crackhead on the news, it would have gone unnoticed.  Right.  Nobody would have cared.  Right.  But since it was, you know, these girls on a basketball team trying to achieve something, trying to make something of themselves, they jumped on that shit.  And our problem is, again, it's just an unbalance and it's a phony unbalance and it's a phony unbalance or imbalance that would get Opie, Anthony, and myself fired if we said the wrong thing.  Right.  That's what drives you crazy.  Look, we're safe with the Sharon Osbourne thing, but the media does a horrible job with telling people that this type of thing was said on a comedy show. 
[00:21:30]  They don't at all.  They don't acknowledge that.  They just say, look at this video of these guys being mean about Susan Boyle or Don Imus being mean about the Rutgers basketball team.  Yeah.  And just not even acknowledging that it was done in, you know, an attempt at humor.  How is this not on every, simply because the guy's a professor at Columbia University.  He's not some bum. 
[00:22:00]  He's a professor at one of the most prestigious colleges in the country.  What happened?  What happened?  I missed that story.  I was just getting in the car.  Oh, we're talking about that.  That's what started.  That's what started this whole thing.  There was a black professor.  Yeah, I saw it on my screen.  Columbia professor pimp smacked the white bitch.  What happened?  Pimp smacked the white bitch.  They were having a discussion about white privilege.  And, you know, they were arguing.  And I guess, you know, she didn't believe.  I don't know what the context of the argument was.  But they were in a bar.  Black professor punches a white co-worker in the face, a white woman. 
[00:22:30]  And it's simply, A, the NYPD will not charge him with a hate crime, even though it was a racial discussion that caused him to punch her in the face.  Yeah, but that's bad, man.  Because, first of all, every brother knows you smack a white girl open hand.  You don't punch her.  No, not close hand, right.  I think that's what the NYPD said.  There was something about her keeping the scratch and not giving the money over.  So, apparently, she had been sucking dicks and not handing the amount of money over.  That was it.  No doubt about it.  So, every brother, regardless from the bum to the professor, got a little pimp on him.  I mean, it just happened the way it did.  But, listen, guys, every time I call, I will say this. 
[00:23:00]  I stay on the longest on any caller that you guys have on.  And I love you for that, man.  And, listen, you guys have a good one.  And I'll check the replay when I get out of work.  All right, Mike.  See you later.  Thanks.  Mike in Buffalo.  Work?  We just lost a Columbia student.  But we do have a cop on the line.  Mike in Jersey.  I'm a cop.  Hey, Mikey.  Hello, Mike.  Hey, I'm in Jersey and not in New York.  So, I'm assuming the law is the same.  But I think the reason why they're not charging them with a hate crime is because it was based on an argument.  The fight was based on an argument. 
[00:23:30]  I know it's fucking based on race.  But he didn't hit her because she was white is what they're going to say.  It was that they were having an argument.  And the argument led to him hitting her.  It had nothing to do with her being white.  It just had to do with her disagreeing with him.  You know what, though?  So quickly to assume that it isn't a hate crime.  Right.  Yet, if it was reversed in the same situation.  They're just arguing about race.  The guy, guaranteed, if it was a white guy hitting a black woman in the face over a race relations discussion, 
[00:24:00]  he would be, at least they would be investigating it for a hate crime.  They would be looking into it at the very least.  Yeah, you're probably right.  And, you know, a lot of times the prosecutor will determine that sometimes the cops are just charged with assault,  and then the prosecutor will determine that it was a race crime that they'll have those charged on later.  But I don't foresee that happening.  But I also heard that the whole fight wasn't even necessarily caused on the race argument.  It turns out she was wearing a hat indoors, and he was just trying to help her remove it.  But again, this is that fucking... 
[00:24:30]  I really don't blame black people for being disgusted with whites in general, because I'm with you.  Because this is that...  It's a fucking subtle arrogance of, well, when a black does something, it's just as basic as you think it is.  Like, if he robs, it's for this.  If he does this, it's for that.  It's when white people always have the other motive.  I'm telling you, that is an implied intelligence.  It's an implied ulterior motive. 
[00:25:00]  It's an implied subtlety.  Black people are never given the credit for having that type of a thought process by fucking whites.  It's a really...  You're by me?  It's such a fucking subtle form of being racist and elitist.  To not think that that was a racial incident.  To just think that white people don't want to acknowledge that black people, you know what, don't fucking like us sometimes.  Look, I acknowledge it, and I think a lot of other people do, but I see your argument, and I know it would be infuriating, 
[00:25:30]  but it does not fucking merit a punch in the fucking face.  No, no, no.  It merits further discussion.  Maybe some of these leaders that do nothing but incite racial hatred should step up and talk more openly about this situation.  But I'll tell you something.  I don't care how disgusted black people are with white people.  It doesn't merit the shootings, the rapes, the beatings, the fucking...  That, to white people, is infuriating. 
[00:26:00]  I might have made myself clear.  What I mean is like...  You didn't!  Black people who get annoyed at this, like, I'm sitting there watching the fucking sneaky white thinking,  and that's the type of shit, even though they don't get annoyed at this particular incident.  Mm-hmm.  It is that sneaky fucking...  And it's not even conscious.  People aren't doing it to be conscious.  It's like, how are they not aware?  Like, if a white guy does it, he's got ulterior motives.  Because white people are able to look at other white people and go,  well, I feel weird about blacks, he must too. 
[00:26:30]  But they don't want to realize and recognize that black people, you know what, have a lot of animosity towards white people.  But things are changing so quickly these days, especially with the election of Obama,  that there isn't as much of this white privilege anymore.  It seems like now is payback time.  Now it's fucking payback time, where white people are going to have to pay for shit that went down when most of them weren't alive. 
[00:27:00]  And I'm not even talking about slavery.  I'm talking about the blatant, hardcore racism that was going on back in the 50s, 60s.  It's payback time now, it seems.  Instead of just looking and going, wow, look at how far we've come with our race after so many years of just being downtrodden, put down in this country.  Instead of looking at it that way, it's looked at like, well, it's payback time, motherfucker.  I'm going to have a race argument and punch her in the face. 
[00:27:30]  I'm going to fucking take this white couple that's out on a date and cut the guy's penis off and stick in his mouth and rake the girl and cut her tits off.  I'm going to beat this young white boy that's been bullied in school over the head and stomp his head until he's dead in the street.  His mother has now left.  It was an only child.  He's dead.  It's astounding that it doesn't take place in the forum of discussion. 
[00:28:00]  It takes place in sheer and utter fucking savage violence.  I'll play devil's advocate.  If I was black or anything...  Oh, yeah.  White.  He punched my wig off in a bar.  Talking about white privilege.  We had it as the angels.  If I was black, I wouldn't want to hear that you guys are doing a better thing either.  I look at it like if it's this enraging just to see the phoniness of the way the media handles it and the phoniness of the way hate crimes are charged, to have it reversed and to have lived through 400 years of that shit must be fucking... 
[00:28:30]  I'm not...  No one lived through 400 fucking years of it.  You know what I'm talking about.  I know what you're talking about as a culture.  It's got to be enraging.  If it's this annoying just watching it not be reported properly, I'm not excusing the guy punched her in the face at all.  I'm only saying if I was black, I wouldn't want to hear that you guys are doing better.  That wouldn't be good enough.  I wouldn't want to fucking...  No, you know what it is? 
[00:29:00]  You don't have to hear it.  Look around.  I would be infuriated too if someone came up and patted you on the back and goes, look how better things are.  But apparently no one's fucking noticing it.  I think the black community ought to look around and see how much has changed over...  It's like if you start out your life, let's say, you know, the whole 400 years is the period of one person's life.  And they start out in this life and they're just...  Their life sucks a fucking ass.  It really does suck. 
[00:29:30]  And then later on in life, you start getting better and you get a better job and you're making a lot more money.  You're more comfortable.  Things are going better.  And all you do is sit there and say, well, I want the next level, motherfucker.  I'm not happy where I am.  Instead of looking back at where you were, looking where you are and going, wow, shit has changed.  We really have a good power base.  How am I arguing the other side?  All right, let's just say that instead of 400 years, let's make it realistic 40 years.  Let's just say 10 years for every 100.  Understood.  And let's just say that for the first 40 years, it's one way. 
[00:30:00]  And then when you turn 40, things get better and you're 43 now.  It isn't that much of a percentage.  I don't think it's 40 and then 40.  And the 400 years of oppression, I mean, come on.  Let's just, let's knock that shit off.  I'll fucking take the Jim Crow, all that blatant racism that went on post-Civil War, shit like that.  But I'm not going to eat the entire fucking slave trade of 400 years for the white man as we sit here in our fucking 40s. 
[00:30:30]  You know, I mean, it's time to look around at this country.  Look at this fucking, this freight train of diversity that is plowing over white society, by the way.  Some people say it's good.  Some people say it's bad.  I'm not even going to make that judgment.  I'm saying it's happening.  Whatever it is, good or bad or indifferent, it's happening.  A freight train of diversity is plowing over the culture that built America into what it is right now. 
[00:31:00]  And personally, I personally don't see it as a good thing.  Some people do.  But it's, you can't then look at the path and keep dredging that fucking shit up.  Enough.  I partially agree.  The thing I have a problem with is, or that I can understand from having talked to it, is like, it's not even, it's like, I don't think people consciously, I'm only looking at the way I get so irritated at watching this stuff. 
[00:31:30]  Like, how annoyed that makes me, I know in the other situation, I'd be, I'd be fucking uncontrollably, and the fact, if blacks are furious or, fine, I'm only saying that if you do snap and punch somebody in the face, you gotta take the fucking hit and be charged with a hate crime and go to jail and the media should cover it.  That's.  You're getting no argument from me on that.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, there's gotta be a balance in the way, it's almost like, there's no way to be extreme either way.  Like, people who would, like, the media blackout of it is sickening, and I can't, I can't look at it and go, ah, it's in the past, let it go. 
[00:32:00]  I can't look at that either, because I wouldn't be able to.  So there's gotta be a fucking balance, and nobody's balanced.  It's fucking, it's insanity.  Yeah, I agree, I agree with you on that one.  I got agreement today, ah.  The Columbia student called back.  Rob, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Rob.  I can't agree with you guys more.  This, uh, this whole situation just sickens me.  Like, the blatant paternalism of my alma mater, just, it just, it's insane.  It's insane. 
[00:32:30]  Um, you know, one thing real quick, when I was, uh, I actually graduated from Columbia University in 1997.  They had, uh, this, this, uh, demonstration to start a black studies program at Columbia University.  Now, the, the black students in the school literally shut down the school.  They, they took over Hamilton Hall.  They took over Low Library.  They took over Butler Library.  And all of the white administration did was shut the gates, not allow the press in, and just wait until the black students essentially calmed down. 
[00:33:00]  So, it, it, it kind of, it's an interesting sort of, sort of racism in that, you know, it's not blatant.  It's not like the racism of the 30s.  Right.  Where you literally, you know, winch somebody, beat somebody over the head.  But it's almost, to Jimmy's point, kind of an overreaction to that racism.  You know, we go so far the other way, where we can't even acknowledge that a black person has committed violence against a white person.  Again, I mean, I just wanted to call it somebody who has personal experience with Columbia University and, you know, experienced a lot of the good part of it.  But there is sort of an institutional brainwashing, if you will, to, you know, to kind of apologize for at the very best and to allow, you know, rampant, you know, horrendous behavior of, you know, minority people for the sake of the fact that they're, you know, quote, unquote, you know, less than us or less than human. 
[00:33:30]  Which I think is repulsive.  And, you know, kudos to your show for, you know, actually having an honest dialogue, an honest, non-racist dialogue that actually moves the conversation forward.  When schools like Columbia University, who are graduating the best and bright, Barack Obama, you know, graduates from Columbia University. 
[00:34:00]  And they and, you know, the administration won't acknowledge that there's reverse racism or, you know, blatant racism going on.  That's what drives you crazy.  It's like, again, it's that fear of exposure.  And that's why I was attacking white people, because the media is run by white people.  It's not run by black people.  It's a bunch of white people afraid of being exposed as who they are.  I'm not afraid of being exposed.  Like, I would love to have, whether it's a black intellectual, anybody in here to debate this point. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  And it's like, I don't think that they have no points to make.  But I'm not afraid of being exposed.  I'm not afraid I'm going to say something which is going to be an insight at all.  I have no fear that I'm going to say anything exposing.  So I'm honest.  And I'm not, I shouldn't be pat on the back.  It's just the way people should be.  Yeah.  But this fucking, this phony, lock myself in a padded room and just pretend it doesn't exist because I'm afraid I'm going to say something that exposes me as a racist.  This is the attitude these universities have and that the media in general has. 
[00:35:00]  And the people that go into the media, why?  Because they're fucking pumped out of these universities.  That's why I call it the, you know.  Thanks for the call, man.  The new Scarlet Letter.  Thanks, Lockett.  Take care.  It's the new Scarlet Letter.  R.  Racist.  If you've got that tag on you, you're done.  And that's got, it's just got to stop.  You have to be able to sit down like we are right here, have an open conversation about race and have, you know, when Patrice is in here and people say, oh, why does the conversation usually go to race?  Because Patrice is so good at discussing his side of it, honestly, not this bullshit side of it. 
[00:35:30]  And we discuss it honestly, not the white bullshit side of it.  And you really kind of can get a feel for that there is this, a lot of fucking common ground that is just mired in white guilt and blacks with this, and it's funny I say it and people beat on me all the time for saying this, entitlement. 
[00:36:00]  Because entitlement has been used as a word that only goes with white, white entitlement.  I'm talking about present day.  There is black entitlement going on right now that is transcending white entitlement based on two different things.  We have a history as white society of this entitlement based on a power base, based on the fact that we've been in charge for so long, things like that.  The black entitlement is based on nothing but fear of people being called a racist. 
[00:36:30]  And it's working.  It's working.  And me and Opie one time, this is, it's like, this is how, and remember when Geraldo was in, and how fucking crazy he was that I implied that Spanish people didn't learn English as fast as other groups did.  I said all I asked for is that people learn English and respect our kind of culture.  That was a rational thing.  Oh, and the knee jerk, and he wasn't expecting to get fucking shit back. 
[00:37:00]  And he's like, oh, that's not true, blah, blah, blah.  Me and Opie walking home that day, that fucking day, and we asked you a question.  Remember they were building something in your building?  We lived next door.  And I asked the guy, what are you guys building here?  Is this like a new, five Spanish guys?  Not one of them spoke English.  Not one word.  He was like, where the fuck is Geraldo?  You translate for me, Geraldo.  Literally, it was an hour after he had the argument.  He didn't even have to search it out.  Coop in Queens has something for you, Ant.  Coop, what's up?  Hey, yo, what's up?  Hey. 
[00:37:30]  Yo, Ant, you were saying that, for one, black people need to stop looking at their past.  First of all, you cannot stop looking at your past because you won't know where you're going.  And secondly, how could you say everything we've achieved, because everything blacks have quote-unquote achieved in this country,  whites have given it to us, because once blacks started screaming black, and I'm proud,  and we want this, we want that, the first thing whites did, instead of sitting down and talking about all that shit that led up to that moment,  y'all immediately legislated, white people need to like black people. 
[00:38:00]  White people must hire black people.  White people must allow them to do their schools, and this and that and a third.  So what are you saying?  We achieved this.  We achieved it because of the fear of this fucking country burning down.  Instead of being honest and talking, white people said,  Well, let's be real.  You're 10%.  We'd kick your ass.  Come on.  Come on.  Well, whatever the case may be, 10%, I'm not talking numbers here.  I'm talking basically what happened, and the fact of the matter is, 
[00:38:30]  we haven't got this because, we only got this because this is what you've given us.  All right, I'll agree with that.  You know something?  I will agree with that.  Did he say Jimmy was right?  I will, yes.  Yeah, he did.  I will agree with your point.  That's a good point.  I wasn't looking at it that way.  It has been legislated that you be given certain things over the past few years.  And about forgetting your past, if I said forget it, I didn't mean that.  I mean, let's not base your whole lifestyle on the fact that you were brought here, your ancestors, some of them were brought here as slaves. 
[00:39:00]  All right, so let me ask you this.  Okay.  We have some sense of what happened during slavery, everybody.  I'm going to tell you this, though.  Black people today are a product of what white people wanted us to be.  If you've seen Roots, you talk about Roots enough times, you will know that the moment Kunta Kinte became Toby, he became Toby.  That's what the white man wanted.  The white man don't want Kunta Kinte.  Well, okay, now let me, allow me to retort. 
[00:39:30]  Retort, brother, retort.  There, we, I guess America was faced with a huge problem after the Emancipation Proclamation because you can't have a culture that is so different.  But it's a culture that you created.  We were our own culture.  No, no, I mean your own culture.  Yeah, yeah.  We put ourselves in Africa, excuse me, prior to coming over here from Africa, we were our own culture. 
[00:40:00]  We were doing us.  We were doing our own thing.  When we got here, you destroyed families.  You took away cultural icons that we had, our drums, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And you said, your name is no longer Shaboom.  Yeah.  Your name is now Keith.  I understand.  I'm not saying that was right.  I'm not saying slavery was right.  What I'm saying is we couldn't then make the United States a Zulu in fucking Arizona.  It wasn't going to work.  So there had to be, there had to be an assimilation of black people to white society, which was, which was the, what that is is you wanting black people. 
[00:40:30]  Not wanting, and it was, it was the only, it was the only thing to do.  It's not what, what people wanted.  What were we then supposed to do?  Either send everybody back to Africa or have them assimilate to the country that was here, the United States, or make your own homeland in the United States where you could then live as tribes and perhaps engage in genocide and hacking people apart with machetes like they are in Africa. 
[00:41:00]  That's what, because that's what we were doing in Africa prior to the-  Well, that's what's going on in Africa now, so count your blessings.  You know what, but we're not talking about Africa.  We're talking about our own yard, which is the United States.  All right, then what should have been done post-slavery?  I want to tell you exactly, I don't, listen, first of all, after the so-called Emancipation Proclamation, there were many Africans who did go over to Africa.  And at the same time, the Africans who stayed here, there were many who stayed here who tried to create their own communities. 
[00:41:30]  They tried to do their own, educate themselves, but what happened?  You gave birth to people such as the Ku Klux Klan, who, instead of these black people, wanted to leave white people alone.  We were known as slaves, let's look at the fuck out of here, leave these crazy crackers alone, we're going to do us.  And what happened?  White men started attacking and burning and lynching and murdering these black men.  Yeah, that shit was-  And they're cashing them.  What the fuck are you cashing them for?  Let me understand that shit's-  You think I'm sitting here saying that shit's right? 
[00:42:00]  Okay, but why?  And you know what, let me tell you something.  I want to tell you how this whole thing, the whole white men, the idea of black men being subservient and obedient to white people is so ingrained in that, and to white men, it's so ingrained in your subconscious,  is that after the Emancipation Proclamation, and the country started moving towards west, what did y'all call yourselves?  You called yourselves cowboys.  And what is a cow? 
[00:42:30]  A cow's an effeminate, a female bovine, a term you used to use to feminize black males.  And the fact that you no longer had your fucking little black middle nigger slaves was that you called yourselves cowboys and you started killing buffalo and doing all this other bullshit.  You're getting a little deep there.  I think they were just cattle.  They were working cattle, so they were called cowboys.  Coop, your name is Coop, right?  Yeah, Coop.  Coop, and this discussion that Anthony is having with Coop, this is like when, you know, Eric Holder talks about honest racial discussions. 
[00:43:00]  This is an honest racial discussion.  Absolutely.  You're making your points, Ant's making his points.  You guys make...  I'm actually an aspiring comic as well.  Okay, definitely use this in your work, man.  Funny stuff.  The point I'm making is like, this is the discussion that fucking white liberals are afraid to have.  Afraid to have, absolutely.  It's almost like they're afraid of hearing, because there's a lot of anger coming from black people about it.  And look, I'm not saying I wouldn't be the same way in that situation.  But white people are afraid to have that discussion and be wrong on some points and be right on other points. 
[00:43:30]  It's like, that's, this is what an honest racial discussion sounds like.  It's not two guys that want to kill each other.  It's two guys arguing from their own yards and seeing things a certain way.  And this is what fucking white elitists avoid at all costs.  And that's why there's no charge of hate crimes.  This is why I'm such a fan of you guys' show.  Like, with everything I've said, I'll be honest with you, I think about racism a lot, because racism built this country.  I don't give a fuck what you might say. 
[00:44:00]  When George Washington and all these other motherfuckers we jerk off to every year was building this country that we are proud of,  they were standing on the backs of slaves.  When they were talking about, oh, let's, oh, the revolution, well, you're familiar with the works of Malcolm X, Jimmy.  I'm certain you, I'm certain you are.  I've heard you speak about Malcolm X.  But when you, when this country is fighting for its freedom from Britain, it was enslaving people.  And the fact that this isn't discussed is what drives me insane.  And the reason, and this is why this country is going to continue to go the way it's going to go. 
[00:44:30]  White people are going to look down at black people.  Black people are going to be frustrated with white people.  And they're going to keep doing the same thing.  And the only thing, somebody's going to keep, they're going to give you another Obama and say, no, it's changed.  But it hasn't changed because Obama is the president of the same racist system that George Washington and the rest of them created.  That's why this country is not going to change.  It's going to be the same shit.  We're going to be beefing.  You're going to, white people are going to be this.  White people are going to be that.  And it's going to be the same shit over and over and over.  You don't think the fact that, you don't think the fact that there is a black president is, is progress? 
[00:45:00]  Okay, I understand, quote, progress.  But the whole thing is, Obama is the president of a racist, is the president of a system that was built on racism.  You understand what I'm saying?  I don't necessarily agree with that because even though maybe the system was built that way.  This country was built around the supremacy of white men.  No, no, no, but what I'm saying is this.  Every society.  We were the one that built the fucking boats and came over.  Jesus Christ, dude.  If you go back, Cooper, if you go back over any country's history, you're going to find, hold on. 
[00:45:30]  Hold on, hold on, Cooper.  You're going to find reprehensible parts of every country's history.  To say that the country isn't different now than it was back then is not true.  And I don't think Obama's just a figurehead.  I don't think Condoleezza Rice or Colin Powell, people, you know, Secretary of State, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now the president.  I don't think that they're just figureheads.  I think that they're people that really deserve to be where they are.  I mean, some people don't like Obama.  They didn't like Bush.  But these are not people who are just thrown up there to appease blacks.  There are people in real positions of power and real positions of influence in the country. 
[00:46:00]  It's just, hold on, it's a slow process.  We as humans live, what, 80 years?  Because none of us are going to live from beginning to middle to end of the process.  So whatever part of the fucking process we're in, it's all we see.  But we're kind of in the middle of the process right now.  A hundred years from now, people will look back at this time and go, oh, okay.  Well, that's profound, Jimmy.  But, I mean, it's the way it is.  I'm not disagreeing with you, but we're not going to get there being dishonest and hiding everything from you.  Oh, I agree.  I agree.  But I don't think that we're being dishonest during this discussion at all.  No, not in this particular discussion, but in general, you say the media, because the media don't want to talk about race. 
[00:46:30]  You're right.  Because you talk about race, you've got to talk about everything that's come attached to racism.  The ugly face of racism.  Honestly, I honestly believe white people are scared to do that.  I agree.  I agree.  I agree with you.  Oh, fuck yeah, Coop, now we agree on something.  White people are scared shit of black people.  No, but they're just scared of hearing what he just said and that type of black anger because, again, the political correctness is a fear of exposure.  It's not a fucking politeness. 
[00:47:00]  It's not a genuine caring or respect phony.  It's a fear of all of a sudden you being opened up and being seen for what you are as a racist or as an elitist, and that's what they don't want.  All right.  Thank you, Coop.  Very good, my brother.  Thank you.  I want to go on to Ray in D.C.  Ray, what's up, buddy?  Oh, you doesn't have to call him Ray.  I absolutely enjoy your show, fellas.  But, you know, obviously you can tell that I'm a brother with my perfect diction and all that good stuff.  But, guys, here's the thing is that, you know, you talk about how race is, you know, the way that it's reported in the media with this particular incident. 
[00:47:30]  But let me give you another side of it, guys, because, you know, you look at when a black child is taken and raped in an urban community or you see, like, a Columbine or something like that.  Those things don't happen, you know, on the black side of the community.  So, guys, it happens on both sides.  I mean, the media, you know, you want to say that it's left, it's liberal, it's this, but it happens both ways, gentlemen.  And that's the reason why I can understand your frustration.  And I think it's good that you all are having these type of conversations where, hey, you know what, you want to be honest. 
[00:48:00]  I'd rather have a white dude come up to me and say, I hate you because you're black, rather than be a white dude that comes up to me and, as you said, coddles me.  And it's like, oh, well, you're well-spoken.  You're articulate.  Right.  That's insulting.  It does work the other way, though.  You never hear about a missing black child.  That's the truth.  You know what?  On TV, ever.  Or even, it's funny.  Or very rare.  Keith Robinson did a funny joke when during Desert Storm, or during this war, when the black female soldier, Shawna, whatever her name was, went missing or had some kind of a thing. 
[00:48:30]  And, boy, as soon as that white girl came up, and you're right, you really...  They found that white girl.  But the media doesn't report on missing black children the way they do.  They pretty much stopped the war to find her.  You don't see the same amount of reporting or concern for a missing little black girl.  And that's, again, but that's the subtle racism of the media, the subtle elitism.  That's who they are.  They don't, deep down, think she's as important as a missing white girl.  That's exactly right.  I mean, think about this. 
[00:49:00]  It's going to be what sells papers.  As unfortunate as this incident is, and as that chick got, you know, two-piece right in her face, it's not the thing that's going to sell the papers.  You know what I'm saying?  And that's what it comes down to, gentlemen.  And to be honest with you, I don't think that I would probably, if I had listened to them, her argument probably would have annoyed me more than his.  Because she probably would have denied.  I guarantee you she threw out...  Well, we didn't have...  I was not a slave.  I guarantee you she threw out that annoying argument.  Two Columbia assholes probably both deserve fists in their fucking faces, to tell you the truth. 
[00:49:30]  Christ.  You're exactly right.  And I mean, the thing about it is, like, you know, I can sit here and I can have discussions, you know, with my white friends and my black friends.  And, you know, the one thing that we have to do as black people is to sit there and say, look, guys, it's okay to talk the way that you want to do when I'm not here.  And, you know, if you can have those types of honest discussions and know that, yes, you know, I'm a big black man and I'm not going to beat your ass the second that you say something like that, then, you know, we get a chance to understand each other.  And that's when we get in that opportunity to be able to say, hey, you know what?  I understand where you're coming from.  Let me give you a different side. 
[00:50:00]  And then you kind of find the common ground.  But if you can't do that and if you can't get to that point to where you're having those honest discussions, it's the same thing as Anthony was talking about before.  We're going to be talking about 1960s.  We're going to be talking about, you know, the fire hoses coming out on people.  I don't want to talk about that shit anymore.  I want to talk about where we are from this point and how we move forward.  And the only way we're going to be able to do that is to be able to have those honest discussions and say, you know what?  I think that's full of shit.  Or, you know, I'm tired of being able to live this way.  And once you get to that point, it's better.  It comes out of white people being dishonest, but it also comes out of blacks, too, because when you look at Eric Holder and you look at the way he's handled race and stuff like that, 
[00:50:30]  when he says America needs to have an honest racial discussion, I agree with him 100%.  But his concept of a racial discussion is not honest.  It is simply a continuation of white people just listening and not being honest at all.  Beers with Obama.  That's their racial discussion on race problems.  Let's go out to the picnic table and have a couple of beers with Obama and not settle anything with a discussion. 
[00:51:00]  Can you imagine if two white intellectuals from Harvard and fucking Columbia, two of the most prestigious schools on the planet,  had had racial incidents involving blacks, say, six months apart, one as violent as this,  and another one as irrationally confrontational with, say, all black officers or whatever.  Thank God there was a black cop there.  That thing would have blown up a lot worse than it did.  People would be questioning the universities in this country. 
[00:51:30]  They would say, what is it with these universities where these white intellectuals are looking at African Americans?  But because it's the reverse, it's okay, it's tolerated, because white people have no expectations of black people.  It's that fucking, especially in the elitist, sickening world of Columbia and Harvard University.  And they will allow black speakers to come in, and, you know, Arab speakers, whatever,  come in and just spew racial hate speech, which I don't give a shit. 
[00:52:00]  I say, whatever the fuck you want to say, let the people decide.  A lot of times people wind up hanging themselves when they open their yaps, like I did yesterday.  But, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, real quick, keep on talking about, like, black leaders and everything,  and let me give you this little nugget to kind of suck away.  We hate it.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  I know, I know.  We hate it.  Believe me, I know.  I was going to say, though, that, but you won't get one of these universities saying, 
[00:52:30]  let us get the Grand Wizard of the Caribbean.  Never.  Okay, which is very extreme.  How about this?  We are inviting David Duke to our school to discuss separatism, race relations in America  based on his side of the conversation, which is no more radical than the speakers that they  have had that are of different ethnic backgrounds.  It's disturbing that it's so one-sided, and they're the little brainwash factories that 
[00:53:00]  they're pumping out these liberal fucking shitheads.  Shitheads, and I love the guy named, uh, Do you remember Khaled, uh, Khaled Muhammad?  Uh, not, not the, uh, 9-11 plotter, but, uh, he was Farrakhan, second in commanders, chief  lieutenant, whatever, and, uh, they eventually had a split because he said such anti-Semitic  things about, you know, trashing the Jews, irrationally so.  But I liked that guy a lot because he was on Donahue one time, and Donahue was such a  fucking paternalistic liberal.  Oh, yes.  And Khaled Muhammad sat there, and Donahue wanted to be a white man that was accepted 
[00:53:30]  by Khaled Muhammad.  He just wanted the nod.  Oh, did he?  Oh, yeah.  And this, Khaled Muhammad did not play games.  He fucking hated whitey.  Although, he lived in, he's so white, Donahue.  Oh, from fucking, his fucking, the hair on his toes is white.  And he was, he hated white people, except that he lived in Cliffside Park, I think in  a white building, that phony motherfucker.  Oh, shit.  But that guy came out and embarrassed me.  Yeah, give me my blind and give me my white women.  No, we got all that, man.  We're on the same page. 
[00:54:00]  But he just didn't, he would not ever, at least that I saw, give in or give that nod to  a white apologist.  It was like, he just refused.  He was a radical guy, and he refused to fall for that bullshit, that glossing over, that  shellacking, that a guy like Donahue wanted to give.  It was fucking great.  Watch YouTube, Khaled Muhammad.  It's K-H-A-L-I-D, Muhammad and Donahue.  It was from probably about 10 years ago.  All right, let's get a few more calls, and then we got to go to break.  Yeah, I got to tinkle. 
[00:54:30]  Brian in Baltimore, go ahead.  Speed round, though, Brian.  Let's go.  Baltimore.  All right, I'll make it quick.  I am a teacher in a 99% black school.  I am a white teacher.  I get to have discussions about race with parents.  I get to say things that white people don't get to see because the parents know me.  I have children in my classrooms who jump up and down in their seats going, whoop, whoop,  whoop, whoop, whoop, when they want to answer a question.  And I say, I don't call on monkeys. 
[00:55:00]  I'm not a racist.  That term is not seen as racist by any of my parents.  But if a white person came into my school and heard me say that, they would try to have  me fired because they themselves can't say something like that.  And a lot of the stuff that I talk with these parents about, the middle class black parents  that come to the school.  And by the way, most of them hate being called African-American because they're not.  They're black.  And when they come in and talk to me, they say things like, we don't like the low class 
[00:55:30]  people that come in here because they feel entitled and they want stuff for free.  But the middle class who work for what they have want to just work.  They want to just live.  They want to just move on.  And all this race crap is usually dredged up by the lower class, undereducated people  of their group.  What about, though, this is something like where African-American annoys me because a lot 
[00:56:00]  of times it doesn't apply.  It's a guy from France or England.  He's not African-American.  But what about the argument, this is where it gets sticky, where blacks say, like, all  we are is a color.  Like, white people, we know we're white, but Ope knows he's Irish, Ant knows he's Italian.  I know I'm Irish, Ant knows he's...  I'm a mutt.  But you can go back and go, yes, I'm English, Italian, a little Scottish.  Which, we kind of, we know that's what we are.  But when you say to blacks, what are you?  They're just like, black, and then what?  I guess it goes back to Africa.  So that was kind of where African-American, I think, started, or I forget what it was called  in the fucking... 
[00:56:30]  Again, if you want to be involved in some of these arguments, it'd be great.  Because once you get to know, once you are the minority, they will talk to you as if  you're part of their group.  Right.  It isn't just black.  You got high yellow.  You got to talk to some of them and find out what they mean when they talk about things  like this.  Because they make fun of people that are, quote-unquote, black, who aren't black.  Just like you guys make fun of Sam.  You got to make fun of people who are, you know, high yellow. 
[00:57:00]  They've got...  They're not black.  They've got...  They make fun of people who are darker than black.  Because black people don't want to date them.  They make fun of the black women who buy the hair to try to look white.  They make fun of everybody better than we ever could make fun of white people.  And it's great to hear and be a part of.  And the thing that I...  I love listening to your show, partially because I get to say some of the things you guys say  in these groups of black people. 
[00:57:30]  It'll probably bite you in the ass one day.  It'll probably bite you in the ass.  Because black people will realize that you're the white guy who's too comfortable.  And then you'll say something that really is fucking vitriolic.  We don't fucking have you drummed out.  We went a few years doing sex for Sam, too.  Yeah, you probably work in a very scary school district and no one else wants your job.  Yeah, exactly.  I avoided condoms for a long time.  And all of a sudden...  Guys, I've worked in a prison.  I've worked in a prison where it was mostly black kids.  I've worked in inner city schools, which were schools for kids who have almost all been kicked 
[00:58:00]  out of regular schools.  I've worked in mostly African-American and mostly lower class, not just African-American,  but mostly lower class individuals and the children of those people.  And I am comfortable.  And the black parents that I work with appreciate how comfortable I am.  Not once have any of the people ever accused me of being racist.  Of course, I'm never going to say to them, listen, nigga, do this.  I'm not going to speak to them that way. 
[00:58:30]  But I can speak to them intelligently about what's going on.  And I can hear an argument like you guys are having today.  And I can actually bring this up with a couple of the parents at the school and say,  what do you think about this Columbia professor?  And when they start talking about it, we can have an open dialogue about it.  I don't like open dialogues.  Yeah.  It's a good one size.  All right.  Well, thank you very much, boys.  And Chip Jefferson, I love your work.  Thank you very much.  Wow.  Hi-ya.  Every time I come into the fucking room, I'm trying to do a karate noise. 
[00:59:00]  Please do a hi-ya.  Hi-ya, guys.  All right.  There's a ton more calls, but I think we did it for now because we got a busy show today,  man.  We got Mary Weiland coming in.  She white?  She's white.  Oh, yeah.  Used to be married to Scott Weiland.  By the way, I just got to bring up, Danny popped up that Khalid Muhammad thing.  Yeah.  He is the shiniest man I've ever seen in my life.  He refused to let the fucking white devil put the makeup on his head.  And I love his shiny head.  It is amazingly shiny. 
[00:59:30]  Looks like he showered in Vaseline before his Phil Donahue appearance.  He was a shiny man.  That guy was fucking radical.  Yeah, and a great speaker.  He looks like a Hershey bar on a warm day.  It's just very, very shiny.  After the break, the chimp attack lady was on Oprah.  God damn.  And we got some of the audio of the appearance.  It's unbelievable.  Also, a 12-year-old girl that can't stop sneezing.  She sneezes what?  How many times?  I'm so sorry for this kid.  1,000 a day?  She is horrible.  10,000 to 12,000 times a day or something?  Yep.  You got it.  Is there a video of her just sneezing over and over again? 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  We got to check that out.  And Carrie, how do you say her name?  Prjean.  Prjean was on Larry King, and she got pissed off, and the audio is just amazing.  So we got a busy day.  Stay there.  Chip attack lady next.  Opie and Anthony.  It was classic.  All right.  Chip attack lady was on Oprah Winfrey yesterday.  And I got to tell you, I knew she was going to be on there, so I checked it out. 
[01:00:30]  As soon as Oprah Winfrey took the veil off her face and exposed this chimp attack lady's face,  I watched for maybe a minute and went, wow, I finally found my line.  I could not watch chimp attack lady on Oprah yesterday.  The face was oozing and pussy, and part of her leg is now this massive thing that is going  to be her nose eventually. 
[01:01:00]  I'm sure most of us have seen the pictures by now.  Seeing the pictures, I could still do that.  But to see the video and to see her talk, I actually had to turn the TV off.  And I surprised myself because I could watch some stuff.  The only thing I can't watch is beheadings.  That's always been my line.  I tried once, cannot do it, and now I realize I can't look at chimp attack lady's face.  She looks like grumpy.  She looks like one of the seven dwarves.  I think that's probably surgery swelling.  Of course. 
[01:01:30]  What a terrible fucking mess that poor lady was in.  I think it's going to get better as time goes by, but it's still just horrific.  She needs a complete face transplant to even maybe be presentable in public without frightening  the living fuck out of everybody.  She is so messed up.  There's nothing left.  There's nothing left except one useless eye socket with an eyelid.  But there's a whole...  I feel bad.  The worst problem is that they had to take her eyes because of infection.  I mean, that's the fucking most horrible point. 
[01:02:00]  Now, were the eyes damaged in the attack?  I'm sure they were.  They must have been.  You see her.  You've got to think they had to be.  But maybe they had some hope that she could see again.  And then the infection happened and they had to take her eyes.  But she has no mouth.  They had to, like, make a mouth for her.  My kid.  The nose.  She can't breathe out of it.  And it's a big mass from her leg.  Yeah, they took a bunch of skin from her leg and slapped it in the middle of her face.  Oprah does not have a heart.  Sure, she does.  Surrounded by fat. 
[01:02:30]  Did she stop eating already?  Jesus, this is Oprah 1991.  She has no emotion.  The more I watch Oprah, because I've been watching a little more lately, because she's been  having some interesting people on there, she doesn't have emotion, this Oprah.  She knows what's going to get the talk.  Look at her.  Look at what everyone is fucking talking about today.  This is it.  This is the number one story of the day.  Chimp attack ladies.  So, the boys got the audio, because I wanted to sit through this interview, but I couldn't  look at this woman. 
[01:03:00]  And then she has no hands on top of it.  Well, she has one thumb left, which Oprah grabbed to thank her for coming to the interview.  She shook her right thumb, because that's all she has left.  Her left hand is completely gone.  Her right hand has just a thumb.  And did you see pictures of this woman?  Not dead.  Before?  I mean, she's like 57, but younger pictures she was?  She was a woman, right?  Not more than average.  But I mean, like, she just looked normal and healthy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh... 
[01:03:30]  Maybe LeBron.  She's worse than transplant lady.  Oh, dude.  A transplant face lady.  She's worse.  Snap on nose guy.  Snap, yeah.  Way worse than that guy, and that was pretty horrific to watch.  And he had two guys after him.  Two chimps were happening.  Sure, sure, sure.  She should have been dead.  There's no fucking way this woman should have lived through that with that kind of damage.  Well, let's get into some of this audio, courtesy of the Oprah Winfrey show.  So, when you awakened in the hospital and they had to tell you what had happened to you, what did you think? 
[01:04:00]  I don't think I kept grasping what they were saying.  And once you realized, when you fully came to understand what had happened to you, because did they explain to you that you had been in this horrifying experience where Travis had tried to...  Oh, Travis.  ...certainly kill you, some people say, even tried to eat you. 
[01:04:30]  Were you able to comprehend that at all?  I don't really know when I understood all of that, because I don't ask a whole lot about all my injuries.  Mm-hmm.  But I just saw there along the line that they told me, you know, Travis had attacked me, and I could figure that out for myself, how deuter she was.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Did the doctors...  When did they tell you you look like a character from Fraggle Rock? 
[01:05:00]  Her eyes being gone is the worst, man.  It's like, even after a face transplant, she won't be able to fucking see.  Right.  We gotta figure the eyes out.  Can we get new eyes?  I know, that's a tough one.  Can we figure that out, please?  I have, like, hearing aids and shit like that, but, uh...  Right.  Boy, once those eyes are gone, you're fucked.  But I wanna know, I mean, the chimp obviously was gnawing at her eyes and stuff, but were they able to see still? 
[01:05:30]  They had to take them out for infection.  No, I understand that.  I guess they were at least still there, and then they get infected.  How much damage did the chimp do to the eyes initially?  I'm guessing the nails dug in them.  Because the point is, I mean, you would think, well, they're thinking, okay, at least she'll have her eyes so she can see.  Because I think that's one of the worst nightmares, losing your eyes over anything, right?  Shit!  I mean, it would suck to lose your hearing.  It would suck to lose your limbs.  I'd rather lose my legs than my arms. 
[01:06:00]  Sure, sure.  I'd rather lose my hearing than my eyes.  I'd rather lose...  So I'm wondering, did she at least was gonna be able to see eventually, and then this unfortunate infection, you know, took her eyes.  I don't know, man.  She's such a fucking mess.  It's like this...  Again, she should be dead.  Would you want to live?  Absolutely not.  Not...  I wouldn't want to live through an injury, but a horrific...  It's like everything that you could try to go, well, at least...  Well, at least...  At least.  Her fucking hands are gone. 
[01:06:30]  Yes, what do you do?  Her eyes are gone.  How do you, like, communicate...  You know what I mean?  How do you do anything without your hands and without your eyes?  There are people that say they'd rather be blind than deaf.  I don't know which I would choose, but there are a lot of people that say they'd rather be blind than deaf because they say without the hearing, you lose...  Oh, fucking no.  You can't communicate.  There's closed captions.  I mean, with captions.  I don't know.  How fucking no?  I'd probably choose deafness, too.  Hell, yeah.  And we need our ears for our livelihood.  God damn. 
[01:07:00]  That is so fucking heinous.  Let's continue.  So, Oprah asked Charlotte if she's aware of her injuries.  Like, that...  She has no hands and eyes and all that.  Are you aware of the extent of your injuries?  Not all the way.  Mm-hmm.  Because it's, like, less early to worry of doubt if I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  But you're aware, obviously, that you don't have the use of your hands.  So I understand when the paramedics arrived on the scene, your hands, they say, looked like they had been through a shredder, 
[01:07:30]  and they were able to reattach your thumb to your right hand.  Is it true that you just realized, first of all, you woke up and you weren't able to see?  That must have been horrifying for you.  Well, I do remember, I kept saying that, well, one of these days I'm going to see, and then the doctors say, no, you're never going to see again.  And I'm like, well, I don't know, they don't know what they're talking about. 
[01:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  But the eye doctor came in a couple weeks ago and said that it's a shame they had to remove my eyes, and that's when I really knew my eyes were not there.  And I said, no wonder why they said I'd never see, because you don't have eyes.  Ah, good one.  Yeah, good one, Oprah.  Nice to reiterate.  That's a very good one.  Because you don't have eyes.  Oh, look at her arm is just gone.  It's just unbelievable.  And why is Oprah interviewing her? 
[01:08:30]  Because it's Oprah.  It's a compelling, it's one we all want to see, but she took off the mask.  Is it much different than a sideshow, though?  Is it a little better because Oprah's asking serious questions?  It's different than a sideshow because Oprah is being compassionate, and it's not to mock the woman or to humiliate her.  It really is because it was a national story, and we want to see how she's doing.  But the fact is, there is a fucking morbid voyeurism. 
[01:09:00]  We don't need to see her.  I mean, I want to see her.  I'm not going to lie, but we don't need to see her.  Right.  It does society no good.  We're not going to learn anything from it.  Right.  A violent chimp attack is a very rare occasion.  We're not going to learn anything from it.  To show an aborted fetus or a guy who shoots himself, hey, that's different.  Right.  This, what are we going to learn from?  Right.  So it's pure voyeurism.  Yeah, let me say hi to Pete in Jersey.  Pete.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Pete.  Not to be mean or anything, but I looked at the first picture I Googled, and she looks 
[01:09:30]  like Alice the Goon from the Popeye commercial.  It's a huge note.  Oh, the Goon.  Yeah.  The Goon.  There are just like horrid cartoon characters, she looks like.  Wow.  Very good.  God, it's just awful.  That's very good.  Let's say hi.  I want to see photos, by the way, right after the attack.  I know they exist, they will never release them, but I would love to see photos right  after the attack, or a video after the attack.  That's going to be part of the extras.  On the DVD?  Yeah, yeah.  Ed in Boston.  Ed?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I was wondering if you saw the part of the clip where Oprah took a tissue and damped pus 
[01:10:00]  off her face.  Ed, I'm embarrassed to say that I actually turned the fucking channel.  And I was sitting there, like, ready to watch this, especially for the radio show, and I  love this type of stuff.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It was so horrific, I had to change the channel.  She dabbed her eye socket wound.  With a tissue?  Yeah, it was a tissue.  Yeah.  It was set up, though.  You could kind of tell Oprah really didn't want to do it, but they tried to humanize her,  I guess.  I don't know.  It runs because it drips and runs down her cheek into the hole that they made for her mouth. 
[01:10:30]  So she's like...  I think she had a little barbecue sauce on the side of her lip.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Let me see it.  You know that she walks around the hospital with the veil because she doesn't want to  horrify the rest of the people in the hospital.  Get a longer veil.  Ed, I didn't see that, man.  That's...  Check it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  She should just become a Muslim.  Where'd that get up?  All right.  Let's go to the next clip.  We got Oprah.  God, Oprah's fucking fat again. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, she's really big.  She is big.  Oh, I thought you were saying something.  No, she works here, but I'm going to comment on it.  Well, she knows she got fat.  They had to bring her up in the freight elevator when she was here.  She got fat.  Shock?  We'll just leave that one.  So why do you wear the veil?  What do you think, asshole?  So I don't scare people, and sometimes other people, like, insult me. 
[01:11:30]  Who insults this lady?  You're just covered up.  Obviously, but I mean...  Covered up.  Not to her wreck.  Would you mind lifting the veil?  Oh, my God.  We wouldn't insult her to her wreck.  We'll be back in a moment.  We'll be back, yeah.  All right.  Who the fuck is that sick that would insult her to her face?  We'll be back, and then they have this subtle little piano music, the Oprah piano music.  Are they going to play circus music?  They really should.  Oh, my God.  You think there'd be a problem with that if Oprah did that? 
[01:12:00]  You think the media would be all over that today?  Yes.  She's fantastic, and yes, so...  Okay, take a break, and we'll be right back.  Oh, shit.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to play that last clip using that music.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We might have something.  Why don't you start the music?  Same clip we just played.  It's a little different if you put circus music behind it. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, you want...  Well...  No, I want to...  Oh, the whole clip with the music.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  You know, you've got to pump up your interview sometimes.  So why do you wear the veil?  So I don't scare people, and sometimes other people might insult you.  So I figure maybe it's easier.  I just walk around and close it up.  I'll close it up.  Would you mind lifting the veil?  Oh, my God.  So we can see.  We'll be back. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's better.  Oh, my God.  Are you a little maggot?  You make me want to vomit.  No.  No.  So I just came back into the studio.  What did I miss?  Yes, exactly.  But I couldn't fucking watch it last...  Yesterday, whatever.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Calls a few times a week.  Morning.  What's up, JJ? 
[01:13:30]  Hey, uh...  For two things.  She sounds like she's got a cold and a face full of Novocaine.  Yeah.  Well...  And the second thing is I did get some happy news last night on the Internet that she had  recently been in touch with Ted Sheckler's Eye Replacement Emporium.  Ah, yeah.  Oh, really?  Well...  Is that breaking news?  Do they have an AP right next to that story?  Well, there's no EF.  That would bring up memories.  But you know what?  I don't think Oprah's making a mockery of her at all, but there is a voyeurism with it. 
[01:14:00]  I mean, it's like...  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like, why is she allowed...  Again, because the woman wanted to go on, but she's getting ratings from that.  She's getting huge coverage from it to just basically show the face...  The difference is...  Of an accident victim.  The difference is you just got to ask serious questions, and they still allow this in our  society on our TVs.  Right.  You know, Barnum and Bailey and all that with the sideshows.  And it's just, psst, come on in here and take a look at this.  Yeah, it was humiliating.  Well, the sideshow was basically our show.  Like, look at this sick fucking thing. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  But then you just ask serious questions, and then it goes into mainstream media.  It goes into, you're helping somehow.  That's the trick.  Yeah, that's the trick.  You're helping.  This teaches people to stay the fuck away from giant, monstrous chimpanzees.  No kidding.  Holy shit.  We had little Mikey in here, though, man.  It was so huge.  Little Mikey.  We were talking about little Mikey.  I'd have him back.  Hell fucking no.  He was so cute.  But Jimmy put it best.  He said, when you picked up like Mikey or held Mikey, he felt like a sack of cement. 
[01:15:00]  It was like his back was all bone with light skin around it.  It was like, it was literally...  And that's muscle.  It was solid bone and muscle.  At his age back then, he could have killed you maybe, but now, a couple years later,  that was 2007.  Now he could easily kill you.  Yeah.  Well, I think he could have done some damage back then.  Of course he could have.  How does he have such great muscle tone and he doesn't even go to the gym?  It's an odd thing.  They're always bouncing around and being happy and fun.  He was so cute.  He just loved me.  We've got to get him home.  And we all waste our time at the gym, and we can't get anywhere near the strength of this 
[01:15:30]  fucking Mikey character.  Watching Mikey drinking your water that day was so fucking funny.  And then he was giving it to me?  Yeah, and he was giving it to Jimmy.  And chimps don't share.  It was adorable.  Yeah.  But that fucking thing will rip your face off at the drop of a fucking hat.  Not my face.  Well, it would.  Let's go to Vinny in Staten Island.  Vinny!  Vinny.  What's up?  Hey.  If he was on, if she was on more, do you think he would bring the chimps house? 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  We said that kind of yesterday.  Yeah.  Of course.  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Pennsylvania.  Jeremy.  Yeah, I was thinking that she could probably go on tour with Gwar and not need a costume.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my.  I was wondering how long it would take Jimmy to put his dick in it.  All right.  Well, you think she'll get work in Hollywood, though?  That is worse than any Tom Savini makeup job I've ever seen. 
[01:16:30]  Ever, ever.  You got to say this, though.  Oh.  The lady is a mess, but it's like something like Oprah interviewing you.  At least it does.  She does come at it from a very compassionate angle.  It's like you don't feel like it's a mockery or.  But you want this humanizing.  Yeah, I mean, it does make you.  No.  It puts a face on it, quote, unquote, like.  Well.  It does make her a human being and not just a fucking morbid news story.  I kind of disagree, because the lady started the interview with the veil on.  Okay, so everybody wants to see this woman's veil. 
[01:17:00]  So Oprah does the big reveal.  The right thing would have been do the big reveal for a minute or two, maybe a minute,  and then put the fucking veil back on the lady's face for the rest of the interview.  Help us out a little.  Help us out.  So we can listen to what she has to say and not have to look.  But I think it was overdone.  A quick peek was plenty.  Plenty, trust me.  Like I said, I had to change the channel.  And then Oprah should have done the right thing and given her dignity back,  whatever she has of that, left and put the veil back on. 
[01:17:30]  She don't know what she looks like.  So it's just kind of like she probably, if she knew what she looked like,  I bet she would never let them take that fucking veil off.  She could conjure up the worst thing she's ever seen as far as facial deformities,  and it wouldn't be as bad as that.  Yeah, I mean, it's just so much swelling from the surgery is probably the main problem.  Of course.  It's still going to be looking good.  And she's going to have a face transplant.  They're going to, my nightmare is that she can't breathe because, you know,  the septum was probably fucked up. 
[01:18:00]  No, she's got to breathe.  She's got a hole in her throat.  I would want to die.  I really would want to die.  Yeah, that wouldn't be fun.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry!  Oh, Larry.  Ah, gentlemen, rape.  Did I do that right, Anthony?  Well, Larry King, sure.  I don't know what that means.  Never mind.  Excuse me.  When the monkey was attacking you, ripping your face off, ripping off your hands,  what did you do with the groceries?  The grocery line.  You should have just went with that right away.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  I would have killed.  Thank you, Larry.  Oprah, we got more music for the interview?  Maybe we should, you got another song we could play?  All right.  Benny Hill music's always fun.  Well, let's try Benny Hill music.  What?  No, Travis has something.  Oh, Benny Hill will be next?  Okay.  Okay.  Travis, hit the music and then the next clip from Oprah.  Well, I will tell you that it is pretty shocking when you take the veil off  and you see the devastation and destruction that has occurred to your face. 
[01:19:00]  It's really pretty shocking.  When other people see it, I'm not quite sure what their reactions are.  You're not sure what their reactions are?  Yeah.  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's the right.  Ah!  Oh!  That's better.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:19:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Well, the last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook.  Oh, God.  Now, Rodney.  Just some of the reactions from just Joe Citizen.  Yes.  Back to the music, Travis.  Ah!  Ah!  But does that bother you?  No, because people aren't going to say what they're going to say anyway.  I need to move forward and get better and stronger. 
[01:20:00]  Mm-hmm.  When you think about what you used to look like and what your life used to be like,  do you feel like the same person?  Yeah.  I feel like I still need.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I am officially ashamed of the show.  I am not.  Yes.  I never thought I had, like, a point where I would reach.  That is it.  Well, let's say hi to Sharon Osborne.  Uh, Sharon.  A pleasure. 
[01:20:30]  Good morning, boys.  Hello, Sharon.  Sharon.  Yes, this deer was blessed with the ability to breathe and beat with a monkey stick.  Monkey stick.  Well...  You better keep your...  Punching out.  You better keep your mouth shut.  Uh...  Let's say hi to Alan in North Carolina.  Alan.  Hey, boys.  Look out.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I heard after the show that she told Oprah that at least she didn't look as bad as  Susan Boyle.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:21:00]  Let's plug it out, boys.  A twofer.  Wow.  Uh...  People are confused.  I love you, but you've changed, you little, compassionate bitch.  I was the one that fucking encouraged the circus music.  I just couldn't watch it yesterday.  Oh.  Oh.  I had a tough time watching it.  Yeah, that is really hard.  Why is that not, you know, cool to admit?  Oh.  Uh, the next Oprah clip.  You got another, uh, song maybe, Travis?  All right, good.  Oh.  What does your face feel like?  Because you have this, um, this bulbous, uh, like I understand that that part of your 
[01:21:30]  leg was grafted to create a nose for yourself.  So does that feel like it's hard to breathe or?  I can't breathe through it like that.  Yeah, you can't breathe.  No.  No.  And they, as I understand it, were able to create a mouth.  Oh, yeah.  What do you now look forward to for your life?  As I understand it, from the clinic, I'm not a candidate for hands transplant because I 
[01:22:00]  have no eyesight, but I'm hoping somewhere along the line I'll be evaluated.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, maybe when I get a face transplant and hand transplant, we'll be doing it because  they have to be done at the same time for the same donor.  Wow.  I would just turn into chimp serial killer.  Oh, yeah.  I would just go around, I don't know.  But you can't see him anymore.  Yeah, that's true. 
[01:22:30]  How would you get to him?  I'd get, like, a partner.  A partner in crime?  Yeah, and then they would kill the chimps and I would, like, figure out how to hold  a knife with my feet and stab the chimp.  I would be so angry at chimps.  I need help finding something horrible.  Ugh.  We have another clip here.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we do.  Oh.  Oh.  There will be a time, hopefully, in the near future, where you'll be released from the 
[01:23:00]  hospital and you'll be able to move out into the world and live somewhat independently,  never alone, as you said.  And there will be people who will see you on the street or getting out of a car or in a  mall or wherever, and they won't know quite what to do or say or how to react.  What do you want to say to those people? 
[01:23:30]  Who?  I'm the same person I've always been.  I just looked at her, you know, and there's, you know, things that happen in life that,  you know, you can't change it.  You know, it's a tragedy.  Pretty much just saying shit happens.  Well, God bless you and happy birthday.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Happy birthday.  It was nice.  Thank you.  Nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It was nice. 
[01:24:00]  Thank you.  There's one thumb holding onto that one thumb.  That's great.  A little piece of it.  A little piece of you.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oh, no.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oprah doesn't know how to end the interview.  No.  Why would you wish her a happy birthday?  Happy birthday.  There will be no more happy birthdays for that one.  They're just birthdays now.  Yeah, yeah.  Never happy.  They're just fucking birthdays.  Not happy ones.  Wow.  So, what'd you get for your birthday? 
[01:24:30]  That's what I'm trying to think of, too.  Yeah, what do you get somebody that...  That has no face.  Okay.  Pause.  Well, let's say hi to Tony Danza.  It's a pleasure when Tony calls our show.  Tony.  Hey.  Oh, hey, Jimmy.  How you doing over there?  Hi, Tony.  Hey, Tony.  And I just, you know, thoughts and prayers to the monkey face lady.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  Let's go to Joe in Queens.  Joe.  Yeah, guys.  Come on.  Really be nice.  I mean, stop loving it in her face. 
[01:25:00]  Punching out.  See ya.  See ya.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, what are you gonna do?  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  We should send her to have an argument with a black Columbia professor.  Uh, people have, uh, gifts that they're suggesting are a ski mask, a Jason mask, a lot of chapstick.  A shotgun. 
[01:25:30]  How about a shotgun?  Is that on the list?  No, no.  Oh, yeah, no.  That's just there.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Good.  Yeah.  A lot of chapstick.  A lot of chapstick.  Seems to be coming in.  She can't breathe through her nose.  That's the fucking...  Ugh.  Can't see.  No hands.  When you have a cold, you can't breathe through your nose.  I don't think that's the toughest thing she's going through right now.  With her eyeballs popped out of her head.  And then what?  Oprah just grabbed onto her thumb at the end of the interview?  That's just horrible.  Horrible. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, she grabbed her thumb and, like, shook her thumb.  Shook her, shook her.  Shook her.  The lady had given that chimp fucking...  I think she said...  Now she's denying it, but I think they said there was Valium in the system or something.  It's like, you can't give a fucking...  That's what caused this poor animal to fucking react that way.  Valium?  Yes, it was a drug.  Whatever the drug was.  Geez, imagine if he wasn't on the Valium.  Valium, like, mellows you out.  No, but they said that that caused the reaction.  It can sometimes cause a weird reaction.  In chimps?  Yeah, and everything.  I never see that on the disclaimer on television.  It might cause chimps to eat women's faces. 
[01:26:30]  Check with your doctor.  Side effects include eating of women's face, hands, and feet.  Well, there you go.  That's the chimp lady.  Chimp attack lady.  It continues.  Yeah.  Let's see if one of these days she gets a face transplant.  Why are they giving her like...  Why are they cutting her up to make a nose and shit like that if eventually they might  just carve her face off and...  Well, I think...  Face off.  Yeah!  I think if you're in that situation, the one thing you really want is to breathe through  your nose. 
[01:27:00]  Who gives a shit if you got a fucking nice face if you can't see it yourself?  I know.  Who cares?  With a quarter inch drill bit.  Who cares?  And then just...  Right into your...  Yeah, why can't you...  Whatever your sinuses left and...  And start breathing.  Fresh air.  You're breathing.  I bet the husband, though, if they're having a face transplant, he'll probably go over  the ones that he wants and they're like, yes, no, no, yes.  I hope they give her like a...  I hope it's not like someone like Charlotte Ray who dies and that's the face she gets.  I hope it'll be some fucking model who just falls asleep and never wakes up. 
[01:27:30]  Svetlana Nakatola passed away.  She's a Russian model with a giant clit and wonderful hands.  I will take her.  She's gonna get some Breathe Right duct tape.  Jesus.  Yeah, well...  God.  The phone's lit, but I don't know what they want to talk about.  I'm sure.  Well, let's try Kevin in Connecticut.  Going cold here.  I don't even know what you got, Kevin. 
[01:28:00]  What do you got, Kevin?  I thought I heard Oprah say yesterday she was leaving.  Let's give her a hand.  Oh, did they say that?  Let's give her a hand before...  No, it was a private interview.  There was no audience.  I know what she's getting for her birthday, though.  What?  Tickets to see Jimmy Norton at the Comedy Connection in Chicopee, November 27th.  November 27th.  What a fine gift.  I'm sure she needs a few lofts.  Absolutely.  Send her out there and we'll give her a half price.  I won't cop her because ticket sales are slow in Chicopee.  But we will give her a half price.  We should have a...  I'll see you there. 
[01:28:30]  I'll see you there, Jimmy.  All right, buddy.  Thank you.  We should put out a press release that you're giving her two almost free tickets to one of  your shows in the very near future.  We're giving her two half price tickets and a free soda.  Why don't they just...  Why don't they just...  Here's what they could do.  They could just smack one of those plastic with the metal dust in it, smash that on her  face and then she could just draw the face.  Oh, my God.  Like that guy with the magnet.  Right, right, right.  Or just use like an Etch-a-Sketch. 
[01:29:00]  She could put an Etch-a-Sketch on her face and then just make a big square face.  I would just wear Halloween masks.  Yes.  All the time.  Halloween must be great for her.  Yeah, just...  She'd win...  She could clean up at parties all around.  Just schedule it where you could go to these parties with this costume.  One party after another.  And then they'd be like, oh, my God.  That's fantastic.  And she walks out with cash.  Gosh, what a living hell.  Wooly-willy.  She could get the wooly-willy thing and put it on her face and make expressions. 
[01:29:30]  And facial hair.  Jesus.  And whatnot.  Let's say hi to Bill in Alabama.  Damn it.  Oh, Bill.  Oh, boy.  Coffee.  I would like to step up as an O&A listener and donate my daughter's Mr. Potato Head doll  to this lady.  Oh, boy.  See, that's a little wrong.  You can't say that.  Thank you, Bill.  That's terrible.  We got another weird story.  We could, like, do a back-to-back, belly-to-belly here.  If you got anything else on the chimp attack lady, keep calling. 
[01:30:00]  The 12-year-old girl.  We got this video there, Danny?  This is a big story, too, but not as big as chimp attack lady today.  No.  Man, what the fuck is this?  This is like some kind of wacky medical phenomenon.  She sneezes.  Yeah, 12,000 times a day, and the doctors cannot figure it out, and they can't stop it.  What the fuck is that about?  That they can't figure it out?  They don't know.  They're not feeling any worse, and they're probably not really feeling any better.  Mm-hmm.  It almost sounds like it's part of the routine here. 
[01:30:30]  She sneezes roughly 12,000 times every day.  Right now, a follow-up on a unique story that has a lot of 10 On Your Side viewers stepping up to help.  We first introduced you to 12-year-old Lauren Johnson last night.  She's dehydrated.  She was perfectly healthy two weeks ago, but suddenly began sneezing, and now she just can't stop.  Funny Asides, Katie Collette has been working this story.  Katie, is there any idea yet what may be causing this?  Avita and Tom, Lauren's mother tells me there is one possibility. 
[01:31:00]  She's wearing a pepper hat.  Now that possibility is called an Irretractable Psychogenic Disorder.  It's caused by stress or your brain possibly misfiring signals.  The Johnson's concern?  It's so rare, there's no known cure.  Since we first introduced you to Lauren Johnson, her condition is the same.  She has sneezed 28,000 times.  It's not.  I feel like I'm feeling really, really sick.  It's just the sneezing. 
[01:31:30]  Mm-hmm.  This sixth grader can sneeze anywhere from eight to 16 times a minute.  A medical mystery to doctors and her family.  Wow.  Shit.  Oh, the mother.  Look at the mother.  Why so long in the face?  Sorry.  So visual and so cruel.  That's no way to make fun of Meredith Baxter-Bernie.  What could we do?  The young girl looks like a young Drew Barry.  She's very cute.  She's beautiful.  Yeah, yeah.  She's just getting snot on everything. 
[01:32:00]  Obviously.  No, she says it doesn't.  It's not like snotty or runny.  Something's got to be spraying out.  She just sneezes.  Maybe saliva out of her mouth.  It sounds wet, her sneeze.  Well, it's probably just out of her mouth.  You ever sneeze out of your mouth, Connie?  You go like that.  Yeah, and you get a little spittle going everywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  A little spittle.  Here's the second part of the story.  Our number one priority, obviously, is to find out why a perfectly normal, healthy  girl, mentally, physically, could be fine one minute and have chronic sneezing. 
[01:32:30]  Yes.  With allergies ruled out, Lynn Johnson says she and her daughter visit several doctors  a day, neurologists and ENTs, who eventually send them to psychotherapists.  But once they get there, they send us back to the medical practitioners because they say  Lauren's a well-rounded girl.  There's been no stressors in her life.  There's been nothing.  She's not an attention getter.  Yet, Lynn says a neurologist told the family this morning Lauren's condition could be Irretractable  Psychogenic Disorder.  What is that? 
[01:33:00]  Triggered by stress.  There's less than 40 cases, you know, ever documented, ever in the entire world.  Wow.  Even more concerning for the Johnsons, nobody really knows how to treat it, what's going  to work, and even in cases where it might have worked or turned the sneezing off for  a while, a lot of times it comes back again.  Lauren, aware of the challenge ahead.  She's trying to live the life of a normal 12-year-old.  Only right now.  She's ready.  Bye.  We're all going three or four doctors pointing today, but I'm never a kid to see it. 
[01:33:30]  We have to stop sneezing.  All right, look, man.  The news is no better than us because during that entire clip they made sure the girl was  close enough that they could get a bunch of sneezes on their newscast.  Why wouldn't they just interview the moms separately?  I know.  They want a lot of those sneezes.  They had her in the background.  We weren't playing a sound effect over the mother's interview.  Every time the mother talked, the little girl was sneezing. 
[01:34:00]  They didn't have to do that.  They could have easily avoided that.  Thank God kids aren't cruel at school.  I'm sure she doesn't take any flack for that.  Well, we got some people checking in on this one too.  John in Atlanta.  John.  Hey, you think she sucked at hide and seek?  All right.  All right.  That's why we have the funniest listeners on radio.  That should be acknowledged every fucking day.  Would you get it? 
[01:34:30]  Would you be annoyed by saying bless you just over and over?  Oh, bless you.  Bless you.  When did you just stop saying bless you?  That's the first time.  12,000 gesundheit.  Yeah.  Gesundheit.  How does she sleep?  God bless you.  How does she sleep?  All night long?  Oh, she talked about sleeping or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She has to just kind of sneeze her way to sleep.  And then once she sleeps, I don't think she sneezes.  Fucking Wilmington.  Wow.  Right.  She sounds like Hyman Roth.  Holy shit.  If my Barbie playhouse is on the table in the morning, I'll know we have a deal. 
[01:35:00]  Who's answering the phones today?  Why are they really slow?  They're really slow at getting people up here.  Who's that?  One of our interns.  Ugh.  See, it's so obvious.  Take the gummy bears, pass them around, let everybody have one.  Every phone is lit, and we got one guy that I know what he wants to say. 
[01:35:30]  Who's on the phones?  Who's on the phones?  Dude, come on.  We're switching it up right now.  We've got to switch it up.  Who was it in there?  Who was it?  It was our wonderful intern, Graham.  Graham.  Oh, Graham.  Who won't be doing the phones anymore.  What the fuck, Graham?  Graham.  Is Graham the creepy one with the fucking Roman hairdo?  Yes.  Roman hairdo.  Okay.  How hard is it?  We've got two great fucking stories.  Just answer the phone, ask them what they want, and write it down on the line here.  Is he just slow?  Yeah.  Is he slow typist? 
[01:36:00]  He sucks, right?  At this?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, he's not good.  Is Graham an idiot, or is he just a bad typist?  I think a little of both.  There you go.  There you go.  Graham, you stink.  Poor Graham.  All right, let's say hi to Travis in New Hampshire.  Travis.  I think you boys have found a new drinking game, everyone.  Grab your beer, and here we go.  I'll punch it out.  Oh, yeah.  I guess he was implying you drink every time she sneezes.  Well, let me take you inside the show.  That was the only one that was screened, so I had to go with this. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I knew it was going to be bad.  Graham has hit the emergency brake.  He pulled that fucking, that cord on the show that just hits the brakes.  See how it works.  We present, try to throw some funnies out there, and then we continue with the funnies from the listener.  Then you hit the callers.  It's all nice.  I think she'll grow out of it, I bet.  Just grow out of it?  Yeah, yeah.  I bet it's one of those phases like when kids have tics. 
[01:37:00]  Not like insect tics, you know, when they're like twitching and shit.  Yeah.  I had a very twitchy thing like Jimmy had.  I was very twitchy.  Were you a twitchy kid, Jimmy?  They fucking, I couldn't have twitched more if they threw me in a twitch machine and gave me twitch soda.  Yeah, I was kind of twitchy.  I was like blinky guy.  I would blink a lot.  Oh, sweetie.  I was blinky.  I was always very nervous and scared.  Really?  You blinked a lot?  You know those kids that just would blink. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  That was me.  I was a blinky guy.  But that was when I was a real like, you know, elementary school and stuff.  Then you grow out of it.  Uh, who's on the phones now?  Because now it's not much better.  I wouldn't even-  Now it's Butcher.  You know-  Come on, Butcher, let's go!  Let me tell you something.  This has to do with sort of what we were talking about earlier.  I would not give a flying fuck about Sneezy Girl if she wasn't so cute.  If she was a black girl?  Well, if I didn't think she was just a cute girl. 
[01:38:00]  All right, let's just go with ugly.  Okay, so-  No, I'm not saying that.  Yeah, if there was an ugly kid-  No, I'm just saying in general.  It's an ugly kid.  Who cares?  Does the news do a story on her?  But it's terrible.  She's adorable and she sneezes.  Yeah.  I feel bad for her.  It's awful.  Trucker, Doug, go ahead.  Good evening.  Hey, Doug, go ahead.  How great would it be if those were farts instead of sneezing?  Punching out.  What about if every time she sneezed, she farted? 
[01:38:30]  It's just a fucking mess.  Oh, Uncle Sully writes,  Oop, I called a few hours ago and Graham asked me how to spell Spitzer.  No, he didn't.  Oh.  No, he didn't.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  He's not that good.  Can we have Graham for one minute in here, please?  Oh, boy.  He left the room, so.  He's right there.  Come on, Graham.  Is it him?  Get in here, Graham.  Here comes Graham.  What happened, Graham?  What happened to you? 
[01:39:00]  What happened to you?  Hello, gentlemen.  I'm sorry.  I'm serious.  What happened?  What happened, Damien?  You felt the pressure in there?  Did you feel bad when your friend Mark collapsed in the snow?  Come with me, Mark.  All right.  All right.  Well, I was doing calls since this morning.  I think I was doing a good job for the first segment of the show.  You think?  And, you know, there was a lot of great chimp calls, chimp lady calls.  Yeah.  And then I just kind of got a slew of mediocre calls. 
[01:39:30]  I was trying to go through them, and I didn't want to...  You blew it!  I blew it.  I didn't want to put any of them up if I didn't think that they were winners.  No.  The problem I had was how slow you were answering the calls.  Yeah, yeah.  It was very slow.  If you've got ten phones ringing and only one...  Yeah.  We only know what one person wants to talk about.  That could be a problem.  We like to pick and choose.  I understand.  I was hanging up on a lot of people. 
[01:40:00]  Well, you were.  Yeah.  I didn't really see that either.  I was going through them as quickly as I could.  Maybe I'm not very good at it.  I apologize.  I don't think you're very good.  Let's get the word maybe out of there.  Yeah, I think.  Yeah, things like that.  I think, maybe.  I'm going to have Charlotte Nash typing in the information.  I consider myself...  Hold on.  Let's enjoy the laugh, Greg.  Jesus.  I'm sorry.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  I consider myself like the Rudy of the phones. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, really?  It's like, I've got a lot of heart.  And I try really hard.  And, you know, maybe...  Yeah, we know what.  Great.  We'll put you in for one call.  That could also make you the bill of the phones.  This show.  Andy Rooney.  This show hates the Rooney.  Andy Rooney.  You ever notice I'm retarded?  I run a coffee shop at a school.  You ever notice when you get lost and call for Sister Sarah?  She says, beat it.  Genetic malformity.  Says her name was Ida.  Could have sworn it was Sarah on Florida Street.  We hate the Rudy story on this show. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Not inspired.  It was a movie worthy.  Not inspired.  Not inspired.  Some jerk off who makes a tackle at age 58?  Fuck him.  Age 58.  Fuck him with a stick.  See, what happened was the chimp calls pretty much ran themselves.  Yeah.  Everyone can comment on the chimp thing.  Everyone was...  There were a lot of great callers.  The race call, when we had the race discussion, again, very easy.  It's very...  And then we switched it around.  Sneezy girl, kind of a little more difficult.  Just weed out the good from the bad. 
[01:41:30]  And you just...  No.  You weren't cutting it there.  I'm very sorry, guys.  You went to a level.  You should have stayed at a certain level and you were trying to level up.  Yeah.  It was very noticeable that you really just sucked at it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know what to say.  Extremely noticeable.  I will try harder.  So noticeable, I would just leave.  Yeah, I would just...  Just the building.  The building.  And not come back.  Yeah.  You should probably just go.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Can I have someone sign my internship form?  Sign your credits.  Internship form.  Sure, I'll be happy to sign that.  Here, hold on a second.  Okay.  Sneezy girl here.  A great time to have a fart.  You just got Jimmy's stamp of approval.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Just enjoy it.  Just do what I do.  Eat eggs every morning and you can't tell the difference.  True.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Nick in Alabama.  Nick.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Nicky.  How you doing, guys?  Good. 
[01:42:30]  I heard this girl's dream is to grow up and meet a little boy with Tourette's who keeps  saying, God bless you.  What a pair.  Very good.  God bless you.  Thank you.  God bless you.  Thank you.  Oh, she was on the Today Show also?  Oh, fuck.  Let's get more sneezing audio.  Wow.  Can you hit that?  I sure can.  Please.  Let's see.  Here we go.  Back that shit up.  If she doesn't sneeze.  She's a party favorite.  She's a party favorite.  She's a sleepover.  Oh, my God.  You don't seem to be in any kind of pain. 
[01:43:00]  Is any other part of your body hurt or is it just the sneezing?  No.  Just primarily the sneezing.  I'll get maybe a raw nose or a tissue, but that's mostly it.  Yes.  And this all started.  You had a head cold along with your sister.  Let me see if I've got this right.  You basically were sneezing then, but not so much.  She's a party favorite.  She went to a sleepover.  You felt better not to go to a sleepover.  And then when you came home, you came back sneezing.  What did you notice?  When did you yell at her?  Yes.  Just stop fucking sneezing. 
[01:43:30]  The interviewer would have to yell at her.  She was feeling better for a day.  The sneeze with the cold was a normal productive sneeze when she came back from having a sleepover.  It became a rhythmic, non-stop chronic sneeze.  That's when we first really became alarmed a few weeks ago.  So something like five sneezes a minute to maybe more than that, maybe even 10, 20 sometimes?  Yes.  And so the average is, you know, you have an average of that. 
[01:44:00]  But then that kind of accumulates something like 10,000, 12,000 sneezes a day.  Why is she on the news?  It's miserable.  That's the theme for today.  Why is she on the news?  Is this news?  It's because she's cute little girl.  You've not been able to go to school.  She's a cute kid.  She's ugly.  You would pay good money at the circus to watch this for five, ten minutes, wouldn't you?  And is there anything that causes you to sneeze more versus sneezing less?  No.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  It just depends on what's happening.  You can't control it.  I've got interviews really get us sneezing.  You're going to sleep.  Shit. 
[01:44:30]  Right already.  Right.  And what are the doctors telling you?  They say that they have a couple ideas maybe that it's an intractable psychogenic sneeze  that she can't control.  But they can't find any stressors or any trauma or anything recently in the life that  could cause that.  Well, Laura, let me ask you about that.  It sounds like there's some worry that maybe something might have happened to make you want  to sneeze.  Is there anything that you can think of?  Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  It's probably to. 
[01:45:00]  What did you do, Uncle Paul?  It's probably to keep the uncle away.  Yeah.  Um, I can't think of anything.  You can't think of anything.  Nancy, you know, you, you.  And she's the one of the worst sneezes ever.  I mean, maybe 40 cases, I understand.  Maybe.  Is there like hiccups, you think?  Known.  Yeah, probably.  Like a weird form of hiccups.  Well, I think we have to just sort of step back for a second.  Step back to get out of the way of the mist.  When a family's brave enough to come on national television and sort of go through this.  Brave enough.  If you peel back the layers of the onion. 
[01:45:30]  There's a sick motor.  And you watch, Laura, she's sneezing through her mouth.  Not a real, as you said, as Lynn said, not a real productive sort of nasal sneeze.  Which raises the question, and we talked off camera so this won't be a surprise between the two of us.  That perhaps this is more like a tick.  You have to think things like Tourette's syndrome.  Ah.  There's things like Munchausen syndrome.  What?  Where people sort of make things up as a secondary gain of tension.  Unusual for something like this.  Because Munchausen syndrome is usually belly pain, chest pain. 
[01:46:00]  And you want people to run tests on you.  But children who can't stop.  And it's not that she has chosen not to stop.  She can't.  It is now an involuntary tick.  Yeah.  That has taken over her life.  Your dad would have figured out how to stop her.  Right?  Hell yeah.  Knock it off.  Stop sneezing or I'll give you something to sneeze about.  Exactly.  What did that even mean?  To neurologists and ear, nose and throat doctors and not found anything up in the nose. 
[01:46:30]  You have to then take the next step and say okay.  What is there going on that has a psychological basis that you can get.  She looks very tuggy and nervy.  But you know it's also true that if there are only.  Yeah she's tugging on her sleeves.  She must go through a lot of sleep.  Oh my God.  Well Annie I just don't think this is a sneeze.  Doing our laundry.  So I think once you say.  And you don't think it's a classic sneeze.  Then you have to say what is it.  She's in the room.  Classic sneeze.  You sneeze.  Your eyes close.  And you know you have some spray out of your nose. 
[01:47:00]  This is more coming out of her mouth into her hand.  And it's involuntary.  Yeah.  You can tell there's a rhythmic aspect to it.  And that brings up the idea of a tick.  One of the reasons why you wanted to be on TV.  Is because you hope that somebody who's watching might be able to help you.  Jesus Christ.  And you want them to help you.  Because you want to.  I understand you're going to like school.  And you're going to miss your friends.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you have to say about it?  How annoying would it be to share an April with her?  What did you do?  What did you do?  What did you do? 
[01:47:30]  Here's another line.  Let me put a line out for you.  Teachers come out.  Your turn.  Oh, come on.  It's all over the fucking table.  You know the thing we should say?  Hold on.  The craziness of flu season.  All right.  Here's a nice big rail.  Come on.  There I go.  She can travel everywhere.  There it is.  That's yours.  This is not a, you know, sneezing on everyone.  Oh, look down the line.  Damn it.  This woman needs support.  And very important.  Very good point.  Well, Lauren, I think that's what you get to hear, Lynn, from somebody who's listening  and Dr. Nancy. 
[01:48:00]  Thank you.  You bet.  As always helping us.  And by the way, if you have a suggestion that could help Lauren from stop sleeping,  we want to hear from you to log on to her website, which is that...  Oh, they must have turned her mic off right when they went to her.  Yeah.  Because they don't want her to distract the plug for the website.  The website.  Yeah.  That's when they turn her mic off.  Fuck it.  www.surf.com.  What?  At least you know what you get when you listen to us.  This is fucking news.  It's a bunch of phonies.  Yeah.  Another sideshow to get the ratings up.  Yeah.  It absolutely is some kind of thing. 
[01:48:30]  This is like one in, I would guess, a million.  Oh, please.  No, I bet you there's less than 10 of these people in the whole country.  Perhaps!  They said the odd...  It's so rare that there have been 40 cases ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever diagnosed.  Since caveman?  Sounds like a nervous tick, though.  That's right.  That's like going so weird.  That's like going...  Like, because I have a nervous tick that I try not to do on the radio, and that's it.  What is it?  In my private life, I do it three to four times a minute. 
[01:49:00]  So...  Can't give this guy credit because he didn't write his name.  Sounds like walkie-talkie.  Talkie-talkie.  Oh.  Uh...  I think I have a cure.  Yeah?  Um, yeah.  Alright.  What are you...  There you go!  Sneeze over!  That's not a good cure.  Why?  Well, old school dads would do that.  There's somebody else with a tick.  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos! 
[01:49:30]  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Oos!  Wow, that's uh...  That's pretty good.  That's a fucked up story, dude.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so too.  Oos!  Oos!  When you just like...  Love to take a break and eat?  And take a leak?  Yeah, we can do that.  Some of us have gigantic cocks that need to be relieved.  We gotta squeeze the Larry King shit in.  I'm not going. 
[01:50:00]  Mary, uh...  Mary, uh...  I don't know.  Mary, uh...  Wyland is coming in in minutes.  Scott Wyland's ex-wife.  Does she sneeze?  Um...  She's got a story to tell.  Yeah.  Hopefully she'll open up today, because uh...  Some of the stuff from her book, just amazing.  Uh...  And Belladonna.  Yes.  Jimmy's personal friend.  Ah!  Yeah, her and her husband are very, uh...  Good friends of mine, but I host the porn awards they have me in their house, and they  treat me really well.  I'm not very familiar with uh...  With her works.  Um...  Is she still in the business, as they call the business?  She is.  I don't know if she's still doing all stuff or just girl-girl, but uh... 
[01:50:30]  Girl-girl, sometimes they just kind of semi-retire.  Yeah.  I'm in semi-retirement.  She's the biggest now, too, because Jenna kind of stepped down, so I think Bell's the  biggest one.  And she's fantastic.  I want to see her snitch.  I want to see her snitch.  There's enough photos of that on the net.  Oh, yeah?  It's not hard to find.  There might be one more good phone call.  Oh, yeah.  Dave in New Hampshire.  Dave.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Yeah?  You're on the air.  Go.  Yeah, I was just saying, how would you like to take the sneezing girl with you to a bunch 
[01:51:00]  of golf tournaments?  I'm a golf fan.  Just put her on the 18th green when Tiger Woods is putting for the championship.  You think he would get annoyed?  We got a text from Dr. Steve.  Yes.  Oh.  And it said...  It's a really weird text.  It's like, she's hot.  You got any pictures of her?  It's very inappropriate to Steve.  No, it says...  It's called machine gun sneezing.  They can tell if it's psychogenic by numbing her nose.  Which... 
[01:51:30]  Nah.  I'm machine gun sneezing, Steve.  Nah.  Nah.  Don't kill me.  Don't kill me.  Nah.  I don't want to get killed.  Oh, my God.  He's getting light-headed a little.  Fucking Dick Tracy criminal.  Ha-choo!  See?  Ha-choo!  Beat it, coppers.  You'll never find...  Ha-choo!  And me in here.  Ha-choo!  When my partner baby-faced cough.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah. 
[01:52:00]  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Now, uh...  Rob on Long Island.  Rob, you got more than Dr. Steve?  We'll go back to you in a sec.  No, that's all.  Okay.  Rob...  The Doony Egg boy with a sneezing girl.  Sneezing it all out.  Karen, what did you do?  That's all he had.  What did you do?  Ha-ha!  You sneezed it all away!  Hey, we're gonna...  Fine!  Fine!  Fine!  Henry! 
[01:52:30]  Look, it doesn't take an expert.  This is what happened.  Something traumatic happened to this girl.  Yeah.  I think they...  Someone said that, uh...  It started after a sleepover.  Something happened at the fucking sleepover.  Yeah?  And now she's using this as a defense mechanism.  So fucking find the creep that might have done something crazy to this girl.  Did they say that after a sleepover?  Get her...  Get this creep prosecuted, and guess what?  She'll stop sneezing immediately.  Pay me.  Thank you.  Dude, I didn't catch it.  They said after a sleepover?  I believe so, yes.  Oh, man.  Something traumatic happened to this little girl.  I see you've brought some NyQuil and condoms. 
[01:53:00]  Yes.  Why don't you sit down over here?  Hi.  Yeah.  What do you think?  It's not...  Sometimes it's obvious what it is.  Yeah, something happened.  Steve said if...  If she stops when the nose is numbed, it's physical.  Well, yeah.  Meaning if the nose is not picking up anything.  Oh, okay.  Right, right.  But she's sneezing kind of more through her mouth.  They had to have tried that.  Sonny Pirelli.  You know?  Yeah.  At least we know that sneezing girl won't be getting addicted to a cold fucking cane. 
[01:53:30]  I wish my ears were numbed.  We, uh...  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Mary Weiland is here.  Her book is called Rock and Roll and Mental Illness.  A memoir of drugs, rock and roll, and mental illness.  Bipolar, heroin, burning of Scott Weiland's clothes.  Uh-oh.  Heard that before.  All sorts of shit.  So hopefully she'll open up a little bit for us today.  I'm sure she will.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton, stay there.  I feel like it's karaoke night out there. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  On the basement.  It feels weird because I don't have a buzz on it.  Yeah, what the...  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and Mary Weiland entering the studio. 
[01:54:30]  Hi, Mary.  Hi.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Pretty good.  Hello.  You got a new book called A Memoir of Drugs, Rock and Roll, and Mental Illness.  That's right.  And, uh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  You're being very, uh, very open in this book, which is very refreshing.  Isn't that nice?  Talking about, uh, being bipolar.  Talking about heroin.  Talking about, uh, your ex, Scott.  Uh-huh. 
[01:55:00]  We're all big STP fans, by the way.  Yeah, everybody should be a big STP fan.  Yeah?  They're awesome.  They are awesome.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, there are a lot of stories about Scott.  Uh-huh.  You know, some, some true, some not, I guess.  Yeah, a lot not true, actually.  Yeah, I would gather, you know, a lot of people would wonder, though, you know, how far did  it go?  Because you'd always hear, like, every tour, oh my God, what is Scott doing?  He's screwing this up or that of it.  And, uh, obviously, you would know, so.  I would.  I would.  I'm the person to ask.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:55:30]  So you put it in, uh, in the book?  Yeah, a little bit.  I mean, you want to, I wanted to have some fun in there, too.  I don't want to put anybody into a coma.  Yeah.  Right.  You know, the, the most important part for me was getting across the addiction and the  bipolar and hopefully being able to help somebody, but I wanted to have fun, too.  Yeah.  How did you meet, uh, Scott?  I, I, I hear you were a model, right?  In L.A.?  And, and Scott Weiland was actually your driver?  Yeah.  When I was 16, I didn't have a license and you can't get around L.A. without, without a car.  And a friend of mine said, I know this guy, uh, he's in a band, he's looking for a day 
[01:56:00]  job.  Jesus.  So I paid him eight bucks an hour.  A lot of people think it was like, he was my chauffeur driving me in a limo, but it was  just this old beat up Chrysler that used to ruin all my shoes.  It was leaking all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you hired him for, uh, eight bucks an hour.  And I believe if I read this correctly, then, uh, the band got discovered a mere few weeks  after that, right?  And no more Scott Weiland.  A couple months.  Maybe three months and then he got a deal.  And he said, well, I can't drive you around anymore. 
[01:56:30]  I'm going to be a big rock star.  That's right.  I would have too.  Right.  How long after that?  Did you guys like realize that you wanted to date?  Two years.  How did you reconnect?  Well, you know what?  Two years.  She was 18.  I was emancipated.  So he, give the man some slack.  Oh no.  I'm just saying.  Believe me, you, you ain't catching any flack from me on that subject.  You only knew.  Yeah.  No, I knew I, the minute I was introduced to him, I said, I'm going to marry that man. 
[01:57:00]  Wow.  And how much longer before you started dating?  Um, well, we hooked up about a year later in London and always kept in touch.  And then he, uh, married his longtime girlfriend for a minute and then I could understand why  it was a minute for her.  Oh really?  That was a rough time for him.  Right.  And, uh, and we hooked up again.  We reconnected after that.  Now, were you doing heroin when you met Scott?  No.  Did he introduce you to the heroin? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, he did.  I mean, I was no angel.  Right.  Thank you.  Um.  Jimmy's a very sweet boy.  Isn't he sweet?  I just feel that a guest should have water in front of him.  Yes.  That's my, that's my motto.  I've been spending so much time talking about myself.  Not only am I over myself, but I need water.  That's what I provide.  I'm horrible in bed and I don't make a lot of money, but I'll give a beverage to any woman  who asks for it.  You're kind.  Yeah.  This, uh, this book is a great read, but, uh, so Scott introduced you to heroin.  Yeah.  Can you talk about that a little bit? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  Like I said, I was no angel.  I had already discovered Coke and, uh, Jack Daniels.  And.  Good combination.  They're good combination.  Wow.  For not remembering much.  They cancel each other out.  Yeah.  Takes the edge off.  Um, yeah.  I mean, I went to rehab once and then we, that's, then after that we reconnected.  He happened to be in the same rehab that I was going to.  And, uh, we spent some time together trying to both be sober and we relapsed. 
[01:58:30]  And not too long after that relapse, um, I tried heroin and honestly, the reason why  I tried it, I thought it was going to be a one time gig.  And I was so in love with him that, uh, I wanted to understand why he would turn his  life over to this and, you know, let it disturb his career and music that he loved and family.  And I didn't understand.  And I wanted to experience that so I could understand. 
[01:59:00]  Did you understand after taking heroin?  I didn't understand.  Okay, now I can see how people throw everything away.  I understood immediately.  It took about 15 seconds to understand.  Oh.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Now is it for me.  You're bipolar too, which is never a good combination with drinking and drugs.  What would-  It's not, it's not a good combination with food.  Right.  No good.  What would set you off, like what combination would set you off the worst?  I mean, obviously you weren't on anything for being bipolar at that time, right?  No.  I was on heroin for bipolar. 
[01:59:30]  That's good.  Yeah.  It really keeps you calm.  Oh my God.  Um, well, I guess what would set me off, uh, somebody drug hogging made me angry.  Well, that, yeah, that'll make you angry.  Yeah.  I was not happy about that.  Um, I guess it was for the most part when I wasn't using and it was just up and down moods.  A lot of people experience mania as the majority of what their bipolar is.  For me, it was a lot of depression.  I spent a lot of time in bed.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  I had a real hard, high thread count, but also I was not able to pull together.  Wow.  And then you'd have like manic moments where you would be like happy and up and just kind  of like for the party girl and then, uh, crash back down.  Yeah.  Two, the mania was, was two ways for me.  The first was I would get really productive and just get on a roll.  I'd say like, you know what?  I'm getting back to work.  I'm going to Paris and I arrive in Paris and spend a week working and doing really great 
[02:00:30]  and then crash and come home.  Wow.  And so it was that.  And then also I would get kind of jacked up and decide I wanted to use again.  Wow.  Because I wanted to calm myself down.  And getting back to it, when you met Scott, was he already on heroin?  No.  And so you saw him go from this guy where he had all the success and people loved him.  And then what?  He started just blowing everybody off his family and friends and obviously the bandmates 
[02:01:00]  after a while.  Yeah.  He would go into a whole nother dark place when you enter that world.  What made him, uh, get on board the old heroin?  You know what?  I think that he had the same intention that I did that I want to try it one time.  Hmm.  Apparently no one just tries heroin once.  No.  I haven't heard of one person saying they just did it that one time.  It's like, I'm just going to try sex once.  Yeah, right?  You can't remember that feeling and go like, ah, I'm not going to do that again. 
[02:01:30]  The cover of my book, that picture was taken on the day that Scott first took heroin.  Wow.  Or tried heroin.  Really?  I don't think he took it, but he tried it.  Really?  Okay.  He's got some nice gams on you.  Wow.  She's beautiful.  Holy shit.  Mary's beautiful.  Nice pins.  Nice everything.  Are you kidding?  And also, you tried suicide in high school.  How, how, like, you know, cause I had my episodes too, drinking drugs and all that stuff.  How, uh...  Yeah, did you ever go to rehab?  Cause we may have been together.  Yeah, but I'm much older than you, I think. 
[02:02:00]  I, uh, I mean, I looked...  I started early.  I went...  So did...  Jimmy stopped early.  I stopped when I was 18.  I went to rehab, um...  Yeah, look at her face.  What?  Because most of us...  Just getting started.  Figuring out, no one thinks they have a problem at 18.  They have a problem at 18.  In my world, no one thought they did.  Everyone has a problem at 18 if you're drinking.  I understand that.  But Jimmy knew that...  Yeah.  That's why I'm saying this.  He just knew...  I'm always jealous when I meet people that are like, I pulled it together at 14.  Right.  Jimmy just knew.  No, but it was obvious it had to happen.  But it was a phony suicide attempt.  It was the wrist slicing, but not really committed. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, it wasn't committed in high school.  Was it more the attention-seeking suicide attempt?  Actually, I can't remember if it was high school or...  No, it was junior high.  Um, I don't know about...  Well, it wasn't a real attempt.  It wasn't necessarily an attempt.  I didn't want to die.  I just wanted to sleep for a long time.  And I knew that that medication made you sleepy.  So I assumed that I could sleep for a long time.  Hmm.  Silly thought, but I was in junior high.  So I didn't have a lot of good thoughts.  How were you saved?  Um, I was in class and my science teacher knew something was wrong. 
[02:03:00]  She sent me to the nurse's office.  They figured out something was wrong with this girl and sent me to the hospital.  Wow.  That gives you some rep in school when they gotta drag you out of, uh, you know, the ambulance.  Yeah, actually I got my rep in school when police came and arrested me and took me to juvenile hall.  Nice!  Yeah.  What was that about?  That had something to do with your, um, mom, right?  Or your mom's boyfriend?  Yeah, my mom had started dating this guy that was, uh, he was a fucking jerk.  And, um...  Why was he a jerk? 
[02:03:30]  Was he abusive or was he just verbally abusive or physically?  Um, he came home one day and I can't remember what the circumstances were, but he picks me up, like, over his head, threw me to the floor.  And I, uh, went to the hospital.  I was, you know, I was fine, but I told my counselor at school they have to report it.  And, uh, police came, they talked to me, they went and talked to him.  Of course, he said that I was threatening him with a knife and, uh, chasing him and he was defending himself. 
[02:04:00]  And so I was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon.  Wow.  And your mom took, uh, the boyfriend's side, obviously.  Uh, you know what?  She wasn't there, so she didn't know what happened.  But, I mean, I mean...  But she didn't take the side.  She should listen to her daughter, no?  Well, here's the deal.  I was a...  I was a rotten teenager.  And, um...  So you could have actually done that, like...  No, I wouldn't have done that, but, um, she thought, like, they were gonna send me to juvenile hall, like, drive me by and freak me out. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  She didn't realize that I was gonna get an outfit and stay, you know?  Yeah.  So, um...  Must have looked fabulous on you.  Oh, it was gorgeous.  It was gorgeous.  It was gorgeous.  It was like a bra.  It felt like it was made out of styrofoam cups.  Right.  I love that.  It was a good look.  It was a really good look.  So you went to juvenile hall, and, uh...  Being bipolar, I don't think I am, I may be, I don't know.  Everybody is.  Yeah, it's possible.  I was about to say that.  I have a little of that in me.  Yeah, you're fucking quad-polar.  If possible. 
[02:05:00]  But, you and Scott, and Scott was also bipolar, and it's like, that's just, it's never a good combination.  That's a bad recipe, you think, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes it's a bad recipe.  Sometimes it's a good recipe.  Because if one's up and one's down, or one's up and the other one's fine, you can, you know, hold hands through it and get through it.  Right.  But if you're both bananas at the same time, not so good.  Well, he ended up burning his clothes and, well, a bunch of things happened, but I mean...  Yeah, clothes burner!  Mm-hmm. 
[02:05:30]  How many years were you married to Scott?  I know the time.  Nine.  You were married nine years.  Yeah, 18 years, and then nine years married.  Wait, 18 years?  Oh, we met.  Oh, okay.  18 years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  And you were married nine years, was it just...  And by the way, that's like 20 years in L.A. years.  Yeah, I'd imagine.  Nine years?  Yeah.  That's a long time in L.A. years.  Exactly.  When did it really start going bad, the marriage?  Well, we struggled a lot, and then had a lot of amazing runs.  But just kind of towards the end, we took two different paths, you know? 
[02:06:00]  You start out when you get married on the same road, and as you get older and have kids,  and you make different choices, and this time it was better for us to kind of go our own  way.  Have you stopped using?  Oh, yeah.  I haven't used drugs in, like, ten years.  I like to call it a decade, because that sounds good.  Yeah.  Sounds like a long time.  I only stopped drinking about two and a half years ago.  Okay, so you got sober two and a half years ago, for real. 
[02:06:30]  Okay, cool.  How about, do you know if he is, or you don't know?  I don't know if he's sober, but we spend a lot of time together, and he's always fine.  I don't know what he does in his off time.  I really doubt that he's using drugs.  I don't know if he's drinking, but...  You still spend a lot of time together, though?  Dude, we lunch.  Really?  We go on family vacations.  We hang out with the kids all the time.  How many kids did you guys have?  Two.  Two.  Two.  Do you think if it...  Well, it's hard to be hypothetical and stuff, but do you think if it wasn't for the kids  that you would still have some kind of a, you know, relationship, talking, like friendship 
[02:07:00]  thing going on?  Yeah.  Well, I think we would have needed time, and then probably reconnected.  And, I mean, we were friends for years prior to getting married, so...  Yeah, but sometimes marriage could sure fuck that up.  No, divorce fucks that up.  Yeah, that's true.  Okay.  Good point.  So, you go on family vacations and stuff.  Now, is he with somebody else?  Are you with somebody else?  And is that awkward for your new partners?  You know, well, we both date, and we will literally go to lunch and talk about dating. 
[02:07:30]  Like, oh, no, she's good for you.  You might want to reconsider.  That doesn't bother you?  It's like Jerry and Elaine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, we're not bruising to me.  That's not who we are.  Yeah, yeah.  We're all hanging out, happy family.  Sure.  But, you know, we both date and, you know, give each other our feedback on whether or  not we think we've got good choices going or just a dead end.  Yeah.  It was really weird at first.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  I bet.  I bet you had the clothes burning because Ann had an incident, too.  You know.  Oh, yeah?  Let me hear yours.  You know.  Fire.  It wasn't my clothes, though.  I didn't do my clothes, either.  I wouldn't touch my wardrobe.  No, no.  I didn't burn the clothes.  The girl burned.  Burned yours?  No.  Burned another girl's clothes.  See, there's a whole other person involved in that one.  Well, there was a little incident that might have happened.  See, she opened up a door, a closet door in my house, and there happened to be a girl  standing there. 
[02:08:30]  Not a good hiding spot and not under the bed.  You need to work out a new spot.  No.  Boy, it almost happened like it was the DEA busting into the house.  I really didn't have time to stash the goods anywhere.  No, you can't flush a girl.  No, no.  Karen, we needed that girl.  They were going to find her.  And then the original girlfriend comes back and grabbed that girl's clothes and threw 
[02:09:00]  it in the fire pit and a little lighter fluid and burnt it up as my police officer friend  apparently videotaped it.  Why he did that, I'm still trying to figure it out, but yeah.  Yeah, that was my clothes burning episode in my backyard.  There's still, I think, if you look close in the fire pit, you'll see some underwires.  Oh, nice.  Some bra underwires are still in there.  A little metal.  Certain things are hard to burn.  Shoes.  Zippers.  Take some time.  Yeah, you know that for a fact. 
[02:09:30]  What made you do it?  Like what happened that you said, I'm just burning all of this shit?  Well, that was the day that I had my big manic episode that I've never had one, you  know, as crazy as that.  And I really just couldn't control.  I had my thoughts of what to do.  And then I had like a, my true self going, yeah, not a good idea, but I couldn't stop  what the other part of me was suggesting.  Oh shit.  But what set you off?  Was it something he did?  Yeah.  I mean, I knew something was wrong with me and I was freaking out.  Something is wrong with me.  Please help me.  Please help me. 
[02:10:00]  Please help me.  And Scott just thought like, you know what?  You're a spaz.  You are a spaz.  You need to chill out.  And I tried to explain like, no, something is wrong with me.  And he was getting on a plane, going to Chicago, work on his solo album.  And I said, don't get on that plane.  I need you here.  And like I said, he just thought I was spazzing.  So he got on the plane and on his way to the airport, I said, if you get on that plane,  I'm going to take all your shit out of the closet and light it up.  And the minute his phone, the minute he didn't answer his phone anymore. 
[02:10:30]  And I knew his plane took off.  You know, I stick to my word.  Wow.  So you set his stuff on fire where in the yard?  In the driveway.  I didn't want to make a, I didn't want to light up the neighborhood.  I brought out a fire extinguisher.  I had a little bit of sanity.  You were safe about setting something.  That's right.  Smokey the bear hat.  What was the most valuable thing in that fire?  It was that he was a little disappointed because the media's like the TMZs and whatnot, 
[02:11:00]  that, you know, put out the exclusive report because they knew everything.  That it was $10,000 worth of clothes.  And he said, what is that?  Shirts?  Shirts?  That was $80,000.  It was YSL, Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior.  That guy knows how to dress.  And I, you know, I didn't mess around with his, with JC Penney's.  Yeah, yeah.  Went for the good stuff.  Went for the goods.  Did you burn anything irreplaceable, like things that were very personal to him? 
[02:11:30]  Or was there a part of you that knew, burn things that are financially valuable but  not anything that is going to really turn him on me?  I didn't pick like necessarily like that.  A Grammy or something?  Oh, I've thrown a Grammy out the window.  A Grammy's hit the street before.  Holy shit.  Fuck your Grammys.  I love, I love this girl, man.  Yeah.  You're all right.  So you, um.  Which can be repaired, by the way.  There's a place for Grammy repair.  A Grammy repair?  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  I'll never need one.  You and I both.  No pitch.  Now, what's up with Scott and the band?  Because you, you were close enough.  I, we saw, I saw an incident at Jones Beach.  What was that?  A little over a year ago.  It's very obvious they don't get along.  What?  A belt revolver or STP?  Oh, STP.  When they got back together.  Oh, they didn't get along.  Screaming man.  I mean, he's not.  Scott made everyone wait at PNC for, how long was it Danny?  Like an hour and a half.  Yeah.  Well, that's probably because I wasn't there.  Everybody loves it when I'm there because I'm like a drill sergeant. 
[02:12:30]  Go, go, go.  Run, run, run.  Move it, move it, move it.  Get on the stage and he'll be on time.  But it takes.  No, no.  This was so bad that when the Leo brothers, when Scott got off the bus.  We were backstage because we were like, you know, featuring the show, whatever.  And there was some yelling and screaming.  The word C was used about maybe a woman that possibly was on the bus with Scott.  It was a bad scene.  Yeah.  And then next thing you know, they walked on stage and performed like they're the best of  buds, but they were having a problem.  Yeah.  Well, he might have not been in top form that night. 
[02:13:00]  Mm hmm.  Um, well, there's that not, not being a hundred percent that will not get you onto the stage  on time.  And then sometimes he just runs on rock time, you know, it takes him, he's so into giving  a performance and you're going to get your money's worth that it takes him time to repair,  prepare, not repair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, probably both.  But yeah.  Yeah.  So he takes a little time sometimes, but I think he's worth the wait. 
[02:13:30]  Maybe not two hours, but why did the band go their separate ways at first before they  got back together recently?  They, you know what?  We, I think we both filed divorce at the same time.  Like I think I filed at that same time where he, everybody was just kind of done with  his shenanigans.  It was just getting so out of control.  They didn't want to work with them anymore.  You know what?  The older you get, the less you want to deal with somebody.  That's bullshit you want to take.  Yeah.  Yeah.  True.  Would you ever consider if you, cause you guys are still friends, you still go out.  Uh, would you see any future with both of you? 
[02:14:00]  If you both stay sober and, or if he's like, and I mean, but you know, sober for real  and you're both on, on, uh, stuff for being bipolar, do you see any possible future?  Bringing it on again?  Um, I don't know.  I'm, I would never say, but, um, I, you've always, we've spent so much time together that  it's kind of nice to experience life separate.  Um, but you know, I don't know.  I love him.  I will always love him.  He's my teenage sweetheart. 
[02:14:30]  Uh, that will never go away, but I don't know.  Huh?  Not right now though.  Never goes away.  That, that feeling, you know what I mean?  Well, think about your first, your first love.  Oh boy.  You know, you, you have a, no matter how, how it turned out.  That was always miserable.  That's true.  They still have a place in your heart, you know?  And, and that's who he is for me.  So do you see your first?  Uh oh.  Is that what you're hinting at?  Maybe?  No. 
[02:15:00]  No.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  No.  I came prepared.  I knew what I was doing.  She was a wild girl.  No.  I could count on my fingers.  Oh, okay.  How old were you?  So can I have a fucking calculator?  Not different girls.  An abacus?  Well, if you count free ones, I can count on one hand.  Some people don't count though.  How old were you when you lost your virginity?  My mother listens for crying out loud.  I don't want her to be frightened.  She listens to the Opie and Anthony show.  But I will tell you this.  I will tell you this.  I didn't kiss anybody until I was in high school. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, wow.  Okay, but how about other stuff?  Right.  That could be a fucking...  That is really interesting.  She's throwing us off the path.  It took me longer to go there.  Yeah.  To kiss than...  No, no, no.  Kiss was the first thing.  I gotta start somewhere.  I mean, I'm confused.  So you didn't do anything until high school?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That's normal stuff.  I'm getting the drift there.  No, I'm saying that it took me a while. 
[02:16:00]  And the first thing was a kiss and I didn't even kiss anybody until high school.  Okay.  I gotcha.  Any girls?  No, I have no interest.  I have all those parts.  What do I need to look at yours?  Because they're pretty good.  Yeah, they're pretty good to look at.  Girl parts rule.  But guy parts are a fucking good time.  Not to me.  Just, you know.  Well, that's how it feels about girls.  We're going to have to agree to disagree on that one.  You're not going to convince us of that one.  You were modeling at like 16 years.  You got emancipated and you were flying all over the world and modeling. 
[02:16:30]  What were you doing?  Runway?  Print?  I'm too short to do shows.  Really?  Yeah.  You walked in here.  You got pretty tall.  I didn't bring in enough back in the day.  Aw.  Yeah, not a problem because I have stage fright, so.  Oh, really?  Really bad.  And, uh.  You're anxious?  Do you have anxiety too along with like bipolar?  Uh, only if I'm on the radio.  Oh, nah.  You're doing good.  You're doing fine.  My doctor gave me performance and anxiety medication and I took it once because I wanted 
[02:17:00]  to try it before I came to New York to start all this up.  I thought maybe this will help me because I'm so nervous.  I was like, I'm sleepy.  It makes me really sleepy.  I was not anxious at all, but I needed a nap, so that didn't work out.  People were probably like, oh my gosh, she's on drugs again.  Oh, she's so on the drugs.  Do you take anything for being bipolar?  I sure do.  What do you take?  I take a handful in the morning and a handful at night.  Oh, it's a bunch of different, uh. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, it's a cocktail.  A mixture.  That's the only cocktail I get.  Is it stuff that kills?  I've talked to my therapist about, I won't take anything because I'm afraid of creativity  being fucked with.  Yeah, that's the problem.  That's the problem.  And sex drive.  Because there's ways that...  Sex drive, uh-uh.  Oh, so it's not one that targets that stuff.  No.  Okay, good.  No, no, no.  It's just a mood stabilizer.  It just kind of keeps you from going bananas or going down.  I've always been afraid of that.  Like, you just become...  Because I know a lot of guys that have taken it and all of a sudden they got white shit  in the corner of their mouths.  They're like, how are you?  You know?  And they just talk too long and you lose interest. 
[02:18:00]  They just stare straight ahead.  They'll stare right through you.  Those are the people that they do.  Those are the people that they do.  I think they're on something else.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe they're overdosing on it or something.  But you don't...  Do you still think the same way you're used to without the craziness?  Like, does it make you feeling less creative or...?  You know what?  I don't control my crazy.  Because I'm a crazy girl.  Yeah.  That's just going to be there.  Part of who you are, yeah.  That's just going to be there.  But when I get a crazy thought, now I know, like, yeah, not anyone.  No, you don't want to do that.  What's a crazy thought that would just hit you that you know is not rational? 
[02:18:30]  Like, I want to punch someone.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck, that's cool.  Every day.  I get that thought.  Every fucking moment I get that.  You walk out on the streets of New York and there's punchable people everywhere.  They're everywhere.  Yes.  I literally...  Sometimes I want to...  I'm in LA.  I'm driving.  I want to get out of my car when there's somebody slow in front of me.  Just run up alongside them and punch them in the throat.  And punch them.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, right?  Get out of the left lane!  But that's normal stuff.  That really is normal.  Yeah, but I would act out on that before.  Okay.  And I go... 
[02:19:00]  I kickbox.  So I'm going to hurt you.  Oh, damn.  Really?  Yeah.  So it's nice to...  Jimmy's a really good kickboxer.  You want to do a little thing with Jimmy right now?  Yes, spark.  Jimmy, why don't you show us your kickboxing?  Me neither.  And I brought the body of a mushy man.  Normally, I would have my washboard abs here, but...  He left them home today.  Yes, I brought the body of a fucking schlub.  Hey, you used to hang with Dave Navarro, too, right?  Yeah, I got a lot of good friends.  Dave's awesome.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  He comes across a little kooky.  He's really sweet.  There's a couple things in your book about Dave Navarro, though. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  He's got good stories.  We've talked to him many times over the years.  He's a great guy.  He's a really good guy.  But what's the story with the fire department?  He used to call the fire department on himself?  Well, he was bananas, too.  It's like the flu in LA.  And he's, yeah, he had his moment of not being in tip-top shape.  And I guess he would call the DWP and...  No, he wouldn't call the DWP.  What's DWP? 
[02:20:00]  They would come out, the Department of Water and Power.  They would come out and he'd see them and think they were like FBI or something  and pull a shotgun on them.  Or he would call the fire department on himself.  For what reason?  For what reason?  The fire department.  Well, I'm sure he thought there was an issue that needed to be sorted.  Maybe he saw me in the neighborhood.  I don't know.  Yeah, she's gonna burn something.  God, the listeners are falling in love with you.  And for someone that's nervous to be on the radio, you're killing.  Yeah, you don't sound nervous.  No, not at all. 
[02:20:30]  You're doing really, really well.  You guys are a good time.  What made you write a book, too?  All of a sudden, you go, all right, I want to just kind of open my life up  and just let people read all the good and the bad.  Was it an issue of needing money or was it an issue?  No, dude, I'm in the hole from this book.  Please buy it.  I'm so in the hole.  It's cost me so much money that it's depressing.  Is it self-published?  No, it's Harper's, but...  They didn't give you an advance?  They did, but then it got...  But it went to all the drugs you're still doing. 
[02:21:00]  All the people.  No, exactly.  Heroin is expensive.  No, it's, you know, you have agents and all these people and they take their chunk and  their chunk and then you're like, wow, I can buy shoes now.  What's left, yeah.  Did you write this with anybody?  It says with Larkin Warren.  Yeah, with Larkin Warren.  Yeah, because it was really important to me.  Well, actually, I'll go back to your first question and then get to Larkin.  It was really important, and I got the deal while Scott and I were still married.  There's a ton of...  I'm getting so much slack because people think I've written a tell-all, Scott bashing, hate 
[02:21:30]  him.  Now that we're getting a divorce, I'm going to say shit about him, which it's not even  close to that.  But I wanted...  The small penis Scott Wiley came into the room and just bashed him.  We have to fix that because that's so not true.  No, no one would believe it.  I can't have that on the radio.  He's got a piece, huh?  Yeah, I'm sure he does.  Skinny guy.  Fucking skinny guys are always the best.  Yeah.  But anyways, I wrote...  Don't isolate that. 
[02:22:00]  Really?  I didn't mean that.  But I wrote it because I, after I was diagnosed with bipolar, I started reading all these books  about other people and that they had bipolar and it was so much mania and they did all  they were fucking everybody and doing all kinds of crazy shit and I was thinking like,  yeah, that's not me.  I had so much depression.  So I wanted to write my experience because I imagine there's gotta be somebody else that  wasn't out on the street selling it and I thought maybe they could relate and also the 
[02:22:30]  addiction part and it's, it's awesome to know that you can recover from it and you can  be happy and, and lead an awesome life and you know, there's so much hopelessness.  Did you guys, did you guys ever joke about how everyone was getting his name wrong?  You mean Scott Wieland?  Yeah.  Wieland, Wyland, Wayland.  You know what my daughter said to me the other day?  Can we change our name?  Cause I'm sick of Wieland.  She's seven.  She's over it. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, I did.  I was talking to somebody yesterday about the book and they kept going, I've got Mary Wieland  here with us.  And I'm like, no, you don't.  No, no, you don't.  Is, uh, Scott happy that you wrote this book?  You know what?  I'm, I'm so happy cause it was so important to me that he was happy with it.  He was cool with it.  It's his story too, you know?  And, um, he didn't want to read the whole thing.  He's like, let me just read the important parts.  So he read everything.  That's me.  Yeah.  I read the important parts and after he, I didn't read it. 
[02:23:30]  He read it.  I didn't read it to him.  Um, he, uh, after he read it, he gave me a hug and a kiss and he said, you wrote a good  book.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  I was, you know, I was having a heart attack in the other room while he was reading it.  I could imagine.  Cause he, there was still time for him to, you know, for me to take something out if  he was unhappy with it.  Right.  Plus as an artist, let's be honest.  He's the guy's a very, very respected creator and artist and you're creating something and  you want it to be respected by an artist.  Do you respect as well as the ex?  Yeah.  I mean, he's the father of my children. 
[02:24:00]  I just say respect once more.  I always say it four to five times per sentence.  We know that it's a minimum.  Fucking love what he does.  Can you start spelling it too?  I have my aretha moments.  I'm not necessarily bipolar, but occasionally we all think we're ladies, don't we?  Uh, the other thing, I mean, we've almost covered everything, but I didn't know that,  uh, Scott's brother, Michael died.  Yeah.  Isn't that so sad?  That's really sad.  When did that happen?  He was on heroin too, Michael?  Uh, he dabbled in some different things. 
[02:24:30]  He died of an overdose, right?  Um, yeah.  I mean, technically I'll never get the diagnosis right.  I've written it in there, but, um, it was, he had a heart issue and because he used drugs,  the heart issue is what killed.  Yeah.  Right.  What killed him.  How long ago was that?  It was, uh, just before I lit everything up.  So that was a good year for Scott.  Wow.  Yeah.  And you say in the book, I believe he never really got over that.  I mean, that's a, that's a tough one to get over it.  He's not over it. 
[02:25:00]  I wouldn't, I don't know how I'd get over my brother.  Yeah.  Of course.  I have no clue how that would happen for me.  Right.  Is there anything you regret?  I mean, uh, we all look back and have moments and like, yeah, you don't regret life, you  know, don't regret the past or want to close the door on it.  But is there anything you look back on that you're like, like, I kind of wish that was  different?  Uh, yeah, there's a lot of stuff that, that I wish was different, but yet at the same time,  uh, it's all good right now.  So I don't know if my life would be awesome.  If, if it just started out, what is something that you would like to change? 
[02:25:30]  Um, well, I'm going to school right now to be a drug and alcohol certified drug and alcohol  counselor.  So I'd like to get through that and actually complete it.  Um, well, they, they have the best drugs.  Jesus.  Well, you know how to use them.  I'm actually going there to learn more.  Yeah.  What do you got in your pocket?  Oh, and you know, you asked me about Larkin and, um, it was really important for me to  have her for two reasons.  One, I've never written a book before and I needed some guidance. 
[02:26:00]  And the other thing is I wanted to make sure that, you know, what I wrote and I worked  with my doctors and a therapist that the information on bipolar and addiction was accurate.  Was accurate.  All right.  Yeah.  But you also got to pay somebody.  That's what I was saying.  Like you talk about the advance.  Like you got to pay 15% to a book agent.  You got to pay 10% or 15% to a manager or an agent.  And plus you got to pay somebody who's helping you.  Right.  So that's where the money goes.  Do you take responsibility?  So basically I'm on food stamps right now.  I need help.  Please.  Everyone's got to buy this book.  Please.  Do you take responsibility for your craziness?  Yes.  Cause I, I asked that cause well, I mean, I'm nice medical jargon. 
[02:26:30]  Well, whatever.  I mean, I, I got someone that's close to me in my life.  That is fucking bat crazy, but never took responsibility for any of it.  It was always when, Oh, it, whenever it got tough for a good show.  Oh, no shit.  It does.  So just let me.  It's a, it's a, it's a alarm.  Yeah.  It's my mother, uh, Mary, just so you know, sure.  It's my phone.  Is that your phone?  It might be Scott going.  Shut up.  Please shut it lady.  Wow.  What a pompous ringtone.  It's not a ringtone.  No, that's an alarm. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, is it?  That's an alarm I used to wake up every morning.  Why do you?  Yeah.  And I shut it off.  Oh boy.  Look at her.  It just means something.  Trust me.  No, that's kind of cool though.  Look, you get to see a leg.  Oh, all right.  Turn off your alarm.  I'm going to snooze.  No, I don't blame you.  No, because my mom, uh, pretty damn crazy, never took responsibility.  And when the going got tough, it was always like, what do you want from me?  I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm ill.  It's like, well, that's great.  But you know, it's affecting everyone around you. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  No, I'm definitely take responsibility for, um, for all my actions.  You know, I did it.  Nobody made me do it.  How do you explain it to your kids?  Um, they understand that mommy and daddy have something that sometimes, uh, they make  bad decisions because they have a hard time.  You know, when you're bipolar, you have a hard time making good decisions.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And sometimes mommy and daddy make bad decisions.  They don't know a lot because it's not age appropriate, but you know, my, my son actually 
[02:28:00]  saw Carrie Fisher's book recently and she's on the cover dressed as Princess Leia.  And he asked me what the book was about.  I said, Oh, is that a Star Wars book?  And I said, you know what?  Uh, wow.  Princess Leia is bipolar too.  And you could just see the kid lost like 20 pounds of like, Oh, okay.  That's good to hear.  Yeah.  Someone else.  Yes.  That, you know, it's just not my parents.  Are you scared they're going to be bipolar?  No, I'm thinking positive for them.  Good. 
[02:28:30]  And I always say two negatives got to equal a positive.  And, um, that works out math.  I'm hoping it works out childbirth, but at the same time, if God forbid they were ever  to go down the roads that Scott and I have, the difference between us and them would be  our parents didn't know anything.  They didn't know how to fix us.  We'll be able to recognize it and we'll be able to help right away.  Do you think it was all chemical imbalance with you or, or, uh, was it something in your 
[02:29:00]  upbringing or, um, I had a lot of chaos in my childhood, but I think I handled it pretty  well.  I honestly think you did.  And then like later on you realize, eh, this room was filled with people that had chaos  and had chaos in their upbringing.  We are, we are hard.  Filled.  Well, my parents.  Except for Jimmy, I think.  With no issues.  No issues whatsoever.  Which is an issue if you have no issues.  Yeah.  There's so much chaos in my family and, uh, so much in Anthony's and Jimmy has shared as 
[02:29:30]  well.  Yeah.  My parents are 18 and 19 when I was born.  Wow.  Not the strongest level of parenting skills, but they did a good job.  They did a pretty good job and you do better when you know better.  And I'm not, I'm not mad at anybody.  I love the opening a book too.  And just seeing what's the first thing you read.  Like sometimes it's just interesting to see where you wind up.  So I happen to open Mary's book and, uh, I think it's page 158. 
[02:30:00]  First thing I read.  And then there was a modeling trip where I got cripplingly drunk at an airport bar  in Atlanta and surfaced at a Coke party in New York city.  Cripplingly drunk.  That's like, that's how you know a book is going to be really interesting.  When the first fucking thing you read is a blackout that covers, I guess, at least a  plane trip.  I'm surprised that I remember that, uh, there was a layover, which I didn't used to do well  on layovers or late delayed flights because there's always a bar sitting next to your gates. 
[02:30:30]  I'm like, well, I'm going to waste some time.  And then they're like, it's another hour.  It's another hour.  I'm going to waste more time here at the bar.  And, uh, I made a lot of friends at the bar.  Did you ever miss a flight?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, I made a lot of friends and I was in coach and they were all in first class  and they traded their seats for the people that were around me and coach.  So we could keep it going.  They gave off their first class.  That's how you know a woman is fucking hot.  All right.  Yes.  That's, that's cause you're hot. 
[02:31:00]  That's, that's what none of us are getting that deal.  I've actually had the airline removed me from first class.  I have been removed from first class.  I have been removed from first class.  Because I was visually unpleasant.  Because there was a more attractive person and coach that they wanted to bring in.  Yeah.  They've actually given me the fucking two seats and coach for someone with a better jawline  than me in first.  Wow.  Yeah.  Scott and I have been removed from a plane before.  Oh really?  Yes.  For?  I didn't talk to the location.  For?  Yeah.  It's for what you would guess.  Um, was it, was it being visibly drunk or was it being disruptive?  Um, you know what? 
[02:31:30]  I don't even call it either of those.  I just like spilled champagne all over his pants.  And so he took off his pants cause he got to air them out.  And that's not a good look for first class.  Yeah.  I mean, he wore a blanket as a skirt, but still not a good look.  So it would look for him.  And we hadn't even, you know, they hadn't even closed the door yet.  And this is already.  Okay, get out.  We've had enough with you.  Once again, by the way.  Right.  Late plane.  Always the problem.  Admiral's Club.  Ah.  Yeah.  Admiral's Club.  What airline is that?  No, no. 
[02:32:00]  It's American.  American.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  United is the red carpet club.  Well, you made me just get continental.  So I go to the president's club.  Yes.  I love all these important names just to sit there and eat crackers.  Fucking make your shitty flight weight and flat diet coke.  It really is the truth.  President's club eats my ass.  President's club.  Oh, great.  And they got guards at the door.  Exactly.  Guards at the desk.  Guards at the stairway.  For what?  For what?  For Melba toast.  Yeah, exactly.  And a fucking bag of chips.  Well, free goodies.  An apple. 
[02:32:30]  A watered down fucking thimble full of Bloody Mary.  It just stinks.  Could you tell us one good heroin story?  Whether...  I'm sure I can.  How about one that just sticks out in your mind?  Whether it's just you with somebody else, you and Scott, I don't care.  Just one that really pops in your mind.  Oh, God.  Um...  There was one time when we were at home, and we spent a lot of time in our home, and Scott 
[02:33:00]  was drug hogging, and I got very upset about it, so we got into a huge fight, and the  neighbors called the police.  And the police...  We were leaving to go downtown to replace his drug hogging.  Oh, shit.  And the police showed up, helicopter, the whole thing, and they had us in handcuffs.  And I thought, fuck, man, I gotta talk my way out of this.  And I had the worst dry mouth ever.  Just...  And there was a Gatorade sitting, like, two feet away from me, and I'm like, can I please 
[02:33:30]  have a...  a sip of that Gatorade?  Like, I want it.  So I got to talk my way out of this, and I don't know how I did it, but I talked our  way out of it.  Um...  Did they give you the sip of Gatorade?  They didn't give it...  They're like, I'm sorry, ma'am.  What's wrong with them?  I'm sorry.  Give her the Gatorade.  They wanted to hear a talker cotton mouth.  They probably did.  Yeah, it's funny.  Yeah.  Dude, that was some crazy...  My lips were not wanting to...  I was like, hey, this is not...  It's not what it looks like.  You know?  Were you guys scared you were gonna OD? 
[02:34:00]  Where that doesn't really cross your mind when you're in that state?  No.  I wore a heart rate monitor all the time.  Holy shit.  What?  Really?  Because we would shoot speed balls, and it's coke and heroin together.  Jesus.  And I didn't want to kick it, so I wore a heart rate monitor, and every time I would shoot  up, I would watch my...  Watch the watch.  It's like a tack.  You didn't want it to go in the red.  You'd blow your engine.  Yeah.  Just watch it and be like, oh, I'm good.  And...  Wow.  That's fucked.  Yeah, and I always had... 
[02:34:30]  It's so fucked.  That is so fucked up.  I always thought I was very safe junkie, and so I would have 911 on speed dial, right  next to me, my heart rate monitor on.  Every day I would drink one Gatorade and have a power bar to keep my nutrients.  Mm-hmm.  Just want to keep it...  Always good when speed balling.  Yes.  Yes.  You don't want to get parched, number one.  Sure.  That's a good plug.  And you don't want to hear your stomach grow.  You're having a good time.  You know?  Damn, you were in it pretty good. 
[02:35:00]  What music would you guys listen to?  Funny is what always made us relapse was Appetite for Destruction.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  And then it was crack up that he would go and work with Velvet Revolver, but...  Shit, right?  I was like, oh, this is going to be...  Not good.  This might not turn out so well.  Yeah.  He surprised the band when he left Velvet Revolver, too, right?  Yeah.  He just made that announcement on stage.  Where was it?  In Europe somewhere.  Yeah, like Glasgow or something.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:35:30]  He said, I'm leaving the band, and the band's like, what?  He didn't tell us that.  Yeah, I think he said, yeah, everybody's witnessing the last show or the last tour  or whatever.  Is he a selfish guy?  Not with family.  No, no, but I mean, aside from family, like with attitudes and stuff with the band  or bandmates or other partners?  They'll say yes, for sure.  Mm-hmm.  I think he's...  I mean, he's a smart guy.  You know, he's running a business.  You know, he's creating and being a creative person and entertaining. 
[02:36:00]  But there's the other side of it where you're running a business.  And if you're the president...  I'm sure people think Donald Trump, I'm not saying they're the same, but I'm sure people  think Donald Trump is selfish, too.  He probably is.  Mm-hmm.  A little bit.  Well, we're fans of his work, man.  Trump or...  Nah.  Fuck Trump.  I mean, I'm saying...  We all ourselves...  STP.  I still love putting the STP arms on and some of the Velvet Revolver stuff.  The Velvet Revolver stuff.  Amazing.  You just love songs about me, I know it. 
[02:36:30]  Oh.  What songs are about you?  What songs I'm not?  Oh, shit.  No, I'm joking.  I'm joking.  Which ones are about you?  A lot of Shangri-la-di-da.  Uh-huh.  Um...  Let's see.  There's some Velvet Revolver songs.  This might be surprising, but Mary Mary.  Right.  He did a song...  Just a few.  Fall to Pieces.  Yeah, you're...  He did a song called, I think it was Atlanta.  Yeah.  Like Jim Morrison?  Yeah.  Holy shit, is that a good song.  Yeah, that was number four, I think.  Yeah, I believe so. 
[02:37:00]  But it didn't really get any airplay, but if you're an STP fan, you go, wow, this guy's  got the fuck...  They have a lot of songs that are just amazing vibe.  Right.  But they don't get there.  Are you Sour Girl?  I'm not Sour Girl.  I know.  I kind of wish I was a little bit...  I thought maybe you were Sour Girl.  Sour Girl.  No.  And it's because of the dry mouth.  It's not even a cool reason.  Exactly.  Inspired by her cotton mouth.  Right.  Is he going to help you promote the book at all?  I don't really want him to. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, you don't want him to.  It's her thing, right?  No.  Yeah, I don't want to ride on his name.  I mean, I already have his last name, you know?  Right, right, right.  So that should do it.  And I want to feel like I did something and I helped people and I played my part.  Ten years later, like a decade later of being cleaned, do you miss...  Do you ever get an urge and go like, oh, that was pretty good?  Not really, but I joke that once my daughter's in college, I'm done, I'm back on.  Oh, my God.  What? 
[02:38:00]  Don't joke.  Oh, no.  A little reservation.  Those are bad.  It's not going to happen, but every time they have a birthday, I'm like, getting closer.  One year closer.  I think I would start doing heroin at like 70.  Why not?  You know what?  For real.  Why not?  Probably feel better.  What else do you got to do?  Exactly.  I'm not even joking.  Why not?  Wait for your meals on wheels?  Why does it still be comfortable?  You can afford it and hang out.  Screw it.  Put on your heart monitor.  It gets up to like eight.  She put on a heart monitor.  That's the beauty of an addict. 
[02:38:30]  It's like, if you ate broccoli and it caused all these horrible effects, you'd go, you  know what?  No more broccoli.  But drugs, it's like, all right, I've got to have the heart monitor and 911.  Okay, now I can enjoy.  True.  Scott would just go with it.  He was just winging it.  I was like, we can't wing it.  We've got to put this show together.  Set up camp.  Right.  You probably saved his life with everything you were doing to set this whole thing up.  Who knows?  Hey, is the band healthy?  Yeah, they're good.  Because I think I read recently they're getting ready to maybe try to- 
[02:39:00]  They're touring right now.  And put out another record possibly.  Yeah, and I've heard a lot of it and I really like it.  Really?  It's good, yeah.  I think everybody's ready for some more SDP.  And you're dating?  Yeah, a little bit.  Is it good?  Oh, a little bit.  LA does not have the greatest selection, which is unfortunate.  Why?  Because they're just fucking-  Just douchebags everywhere.  I would assume, yeah, the selection's limited to a very niche.  It's like you're a celebrity or a douchebag or a celebrity douchebag. 
[02:39:30]  And these are not-  That's what our show is.  Yeah.  Douchebag.  Do you date regular guys, meaning people that aren't in the business?  Yeah.  I actually prefer to never go down this road again.  I mean, Scott was not a celebrity when I fell in love with him.  Right.  So that was never my intention, but-  Right.  Would you ever bring a guy you were dating to a show with him?  Would you guys ever be that comfortable where you'll see his girl and bring a guy you're dating?  Oh, that's the dream more thing, man.  No, but it's-  I don't know.  It's the Bruce and Demi thing.  Scott never wants to know much information.  Yeah, of course not. 
[02:40:00]  You know, he doesn't want to know a lot, so I'm-  We can talk openly, but he doesn't want to meet some guy.  Don't want to see a face.  You don't want to hear details.  Yeah, but you know what?  His ex-wife, she has gone to shows where she's brought her new husband and stuff.  That's weird.  You talk to her ever?  No, not since I was a kid.  Right.  Yeah.  You ever go on a date with a guy that goes, hey, why don't we go to a karaoke bar?  I sing pretty good.  Or does an SDP song embarrassingly bad? 
[02:40:30]  Sometimes people don't know.  I don't say anything.  I just show up.  I went on a blind date like a year and a half ago.  I'm like, hey.  And this guy wanted to talk about music and stuff.  He's like, yeah, I'm a big SDP fan.  Oh, shit.  I was like, really?  Me too.  Yeah.  I could tell you a thing or two.  I like the SDP.  No, I bet I'm a bigger fan than you are.  Do you ever fuck him?  A little off track, but there's two voices I love.  It's your ex-husband and Lane Staley. 
[02:41:00]  You ever meet Lane?  No, I saw Alice in Chains at a tiny club in Milan in the early 90s.  It was an amazing show, but I never met him.  I know Jerry Cantrell really well.  He's a really cool guy.  I like him a lot.  He comes around every once in a while.  Yeah, he's coming around a lot because he's cool.  I like him.  Right on.  I think we did it.  Is the book out now, Mary?  It's out now or is it coming out?  It's out now supposedly, although I have friends and family that are like, yeah, I went to  the store. 
[02:41:30]  It's not there.  There's no way to sell books.  They should be there.  Books should be in the bookstore.  I got to tell you, I read a lot of rock books and I went through this pretty heavily  and it's a great read.  It really is.  It really is.  It's refreshing because you're honest and very open in this book.  You're not really holding back much.  No.  You know what?  Some people live behind a smile and denial and I don't see the point really.  That's not how I grew up.  Right.  I grew up with a family that was like, whoa, this sucks.  Whoa, I made a mistake.  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  There are some wild moments in this book.  You're going to be like, your mouth's going to be open like, what the fuck?  The heart monitor.  I don't even know if I wrote about that.  I don't know.  I didn't see the pages I read, but you said it here today.  We got it.  I'm just looking at a picture of, I guess, yeah, you and your dad in 1978.  Do you like that?  Your dad looks like he has to get up and go to high school.  Yeah, he did, actually.  He did have to get up.  Now, you just said that your parents were very young when they had you, but there's 
[02:42:30]  like young and then there's mature young and this looks like he's holding a bottle  of beer.  Look at how young he looks.  Oh, my God.  That's a kid.  Check out our house, though.  Yeah.  Seriously, it looks like the set of Roseanne.  It's so messed up.  The paneling, the wood paneling.  Yeah.  Yeah, we lived in some interesting homes.  Amazing.  Really cool pictures, too.  I love a book with pictures.  I know.  Fucking 41 and I like looking at pictures.  You know what? 
[02:43:00]  I wish I'd just put out a coffee table book.  They don't sell well.  It's no problems.  They don't sell well.  Metallica, they don't sell well for some reason, so you're probably smarter to put-  Yeah, I have a picture in there that's the day after I first slept with Scott.  Oh.  Yeah.  Let me see if you're smiling.  I think it's this one.  No.  Oh, shit.  Isn't it my rubber dress?  That's it.  No, it was your-  What?  Which one?  You figured it out?  It's the one where they're both holding beers, but he has-  Okay.  He has a look on his face which says, I just fucked a really hot girl.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  He's holding the beer.  I'm like, hey, hey, hey, hey.  We really gotta get her out of here.  So thank you, Mary.  It's called Fault to Pieces.  It's in stores now.  I'm sure if you're just going to non-fiction, you'll find it.  It might be on the front tables.  Never be.  It's nice and honest.  A Memoir of Drugs, Rock and Roll, and Mental Illness.  And how do you pronounce the last name?  Come on.  Wieland.  Yeah, I say that now.  Yes.  I think I used to mess it up a bunch.  You say Wieland, yeah.  Everybody said Wieland.  Everybody says Wieland.  Wieland, too, sometimes.  Wieland.  But it's Wieland.  Mary Wieland.  What a pleasure, man.  I hope you come back and see us.  Thank you. 
[02:44:00]  I hope this book does well for you, because it really is good.  What's the name of the book again, Jimmy?  It's called Fault to Pieces.  Fault to Pieces?  Yes.  A Memoir of Drugs, Rock and Roll, and Mental Illness.  All right.  Let's take a break.  I'll get to the week.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Man, that was a lot of fun.  Yeah, she was great.  Yeah, she was really nervous to do our show, Mary Wieland, and they weren't sure they were  going to book her on our show.  See?  See, we can handle some guests the proper way. 
[02:44:30]  She did our first radio interview yesterday, apparently.  Wow-wee.  Belladonna's in studio.  Giving Jimmy a nice little greeting.  Wow-wee.  Are we happy?  Hey, really fast, before we get to Belladonna, I just want to tell everyone that Mary Wieland  gave us all chocolates.  Yes.  Yeah.  She is nuts.  I love her.  Which I am not going to eat.  No?  Why?  I don't know.  They're fucking...  Put them in our pockets with dope.  No, I just...  I'm trying not to eat chocolates.  Was there a little note that said,  Welcome to the world of heroin? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  They frighten me.  I ate one.  Are they good?  We'll see what happens.  Yeah, exactly.  If you make it out the front door, maybe I'll regret giving mine.  I should be peeking soon.  These are really good chocolates.  We just talked to Mary Wieland, you know, Scott Wieland's ex-wife from SDP.  I was listening.  Okay.  Did you hear the heart monitor part?  No.  That was a fucking reveal today.  They were speed...  Her and Scott would speedball, and she was afraid, like any good health-conscious speedballer  will do, that her heart was going to explode.  She'd put her heart monitor on, and then she would just watch her heart tick.  Oh, my God. 
[02:45:30]  And 911 on a speed dial.  Whoa.  And a Gatorade, and a power bar.  So she was set.  That's intense.  Yeah.  And that's coming from Bella Darling.  I know, right?  Well, you deal...  I mean, you deal with a lot of the same kind of people that she was dealing with.  I mean, you know, and people in porn are very much like the rock.  I mean, they kind of intermix.  I mean, that's every rock star's dream is to date somebody who's, you know, does adult films.  In the industry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The business, yeah.  How...  You know, I mean, obviously, in the business, it's kind of... 
[02:46:00]  Drugs are prevalent.  I mean, is it rampant?  Well, in my early career, yes.  Yeah.  I'm sure it is still.  I just don't see it.  Did you kind of cut that out, or did you slow it out?  I did cut it out, although I was dabbling in drugs before I got into the adult industry.  It's just, when I got into the adult industry, they were everywhere.  I bet.  What year was that?  Almost 2000.  2000.  2000.  Yeah.  What got you in?  Did you come?  Because some girls go to L.A. because they want to act, and they get sidetracked into porn.  And some girls go there because they see porn, and they go, that's what I want to do, and  I've got to go to L.A. to do it. 
[02:46:30]  Did you get in because you wanted to get into it?  I was...  I got into it.  I came to L.A. for it, but it was...  I was already nude dancing in Utah.  Oh, you weren't in Utah.  Great.  And a girlfriend called me one day from L.A. and said, do you want to come out and do this?  I said, sure.  So I was out the next day.  You'd never think that you...  Because Jenna is not really doing movies anymore, right?  Right.  You are the biggest name in the business.  You wouldn't think that that person would come from Utah.  Yeah.  Oh, why not?  Oh, Utah.  Yeah, okay.  You're right. 
[02:47:00]  You grew up around Mormons?  I was Mormon for 15 years.  Yeah.  Now it's just more men.  Exactly.  Much better.  We need a snare drum here.  That's beautiful.  All right.  So you're Mormon, which is, I guess, I don't know much about the Mormon religion, but I  know it's really...  It's not fun.  It's very strict, right?  Yes.  What's the biggest problem with the religion?  The rules.  I don't like rules.  I like to make my own.  How do they look at sex compared to Christianity or other...  It was basically just for creation of a child. 
[02:47:30]  That's what I think.  And masturbation was looked down upon.  Oh, yeah.  What are you supposed to do with all that poison?  You got to get rid of the poison, though.  What the fuck?  It doesn't make sense.  So you're raised in a religious household?  Very religious, yes.  Wow.  Okay.  Your dad does what?  My dad was a bishop three times.  Yes.  Damn.  Does he support what you do?  Oh, come on.  You know, he's the only one in my family that doesn't really want to talk about it.  Yeah.  Do you guys talk at all or no?  We do. 
[02:48:00]  And he, you know, there's been times where he's like, I've heard the girl said you were  on TV and you won some awards.  I'm real proud of you.  So that's as far as it goes.  And that took years.  So, yeah, I won an award for la, la, la, la, la.  I am not listening.  I am not listening.  It's pretty funny, though, because my family, both my mom and dad were not religious at all  growing up.  Two weeks into their marriage, missionaries came to their house and somehow convinced  them.  So they were wild.  Wow.  Yeah.  None of them were religious.  So your mom cool about it?  My mom has her issues with porn, but she's cool with me doing it. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  She, you know, she's like, I understand now, but she could care less for porn.  Right.  You, uh, cause it's such a weird, like you and she had the preacher's daughter, like,  oh, you know, cause they're the, they're the rebels.  Like what, is that what made you kind of go?  I want to do this.  How did you go from being the daughter of very, very religious people to rebelling kind  of this far?  I don't know if, I'm pretty sure it had something to do with the religion.  I just didn't understand why it was, why I had so many rules.  Hey, some girls smoke cigarettes to rebel, others. 
[02:49:00]  Well, I mean, I think if it wasn't porn, I would still be a very sexual person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I loved sexual attention.  So you move out to LA.  God damn to hear a girl say that.  I know.  A girl who means a thing.  It's really nice.  She ain't bullshit.  She's hot and she means it.  Fuck.  It's great.  You move out to LA and you do your first, uh, porn, right?  Right.  How much did you get for that?  I always love hearing that.  Actually, it's funny.  I got into porn and I was like, okay, I'm only going to do girls because I was nervous. 
[02:49:30]  I didn't know.  I had never seen a porn.  Right.  Here I am going to do porn and I'm like, okay, only girls at first.  And they're like, you have way too many tattoos.  You're never going to get work.  And so the first thing I did, it was a boy girl.  I don't know if I'm allowed to say.  Oh yeah.  Anything you want.  Anything you want.  That's how you started.  First thing ever.  I'd never even done anal sex in my entire life.  Jumping in the deep end of the pool.  Yes.  I think I got paid $1,600, which isn't much actually for the first time.  Let me tell you, you would never done anal before. 
[02:50:00]  Never.  Not even in your private life.  I tried once and it was like the tip and I was like, oh no.  No.  Holy shit.  Now, is this film available?  Yes.  I want to see this.  You can see how it was.  This should be the biggest selling porn of all time.  It's a virgin anal fucking movie.  Come on.  And it says it on the box cover.  Yeah.  But half that shit, you don't believe.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I know.  But this guy specifically, I mean, I went there.  It wasn't scheduled for boy girl anal.  The guy, the director was real good.  He was like, you know, do you want to have a glass of wine? 
[02:50:30]  I was like, sure.  I'm 18.  And he's like, so, are you sure you don't want to try the anal?  And I'm like, I don't want.  Have another glass of wine.  I'll give you an extra $300.  I'm like, my agent's not here.  I'm like, okay.  Who was the guy?  Who was the guy?  Thankfully, it was Chow Ming.  Yeah.  The actor.  Yeah.  Very little known.  Yeah.  Lexington Steele called out sick.  We had the agent fell out.  Yeah.  Officially, you still haven't done anal.  It wasn't. 
[02:51:00]  Like, luckily for me, it was like a really slow.  Oh.  They were very careful with me.  Really?  Yeah.  I think if I didn't have that, I probably would have never done it again.  Because you need to ease into that.  You need to ease into that.  Can you tell in the movie?  Like, do you make some expressions that are kind of like, oh.  You know what?  I don't.  I haven't seen it for a really long time.  So, I don't remember for sure.  Can we find that anywhere?  It's called Real Sex.  I know Danny's talking about real.  R-E-E-L or R-E-A-L?  R-E-A-L.  Real Sex.  Real Sex with Bill Whitrock.  And I think it's number 13. 
[02:51:30]  I could be wrong.  Bill Whitrock.  31.  There you go.  Oh, it's awful pictures.  Oh, my God.  Don't worry.  They're great pictures.  Look, you can see all the baby fat.  Oh, that's adorable.  Wow.  I was so excited that someone wanted to see me naked.  You have no idea.  Really?  Yes.  Are you kidding?  I did not grow up.  Like, I was never...  Like, I would always wish that guys would look at me and all that.  And no one ever did.  Well, huh.  Well, they don't get you.  That's your wish.  This is the most amazing thing, part of that story for me, is that you had never seen 
[02:52:00]  a porno when you actually...  Uh-uh.  So, what was the leap?  Like, you were dancing?  You said, I wanted to dance?  Yeah, I was nude dancing in Salt Lake.  What made you say, I want to go to adult films, when you hadn't watched them, or...?  Um...  I...  It wasn't like I was going after it.  It was the girl calling me saying, oh, I'm in L.A., I'm doing this myself.  Okay.  I knew her.  And, um, it just sounded exciting and new.  I want to go to L.A., ooh, what's this, and modeling fun, you know?  Like, I just didn't even think too much about it.  I just did it.  And you were 18 when you did your first...  Yes. 
[02:52:30]  And how old were you the first time you actually just hooked up with a guy?  14.  14?  Okay.  Yeah.  And I was promiscuous.  Yeah?  In the last four years.  Yeah.  I don't think it would be a big shock to those who knew me.  Hey, Bella Donna's cool.  Yeah, it's like, it's amazing to me.  I like this Bella Donna.  It's an amazing leap for me, from like a religious to being so comfortable doing that.  Why would that be a leap?  It is a very kind of like, oh, that story kind of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not surprised.  It's almost like you've heard that story before.  It's like, almost the reason why. 
[02:53:00]  I just hadn't heard it coming from such...  Like, because you know, Utah and Mormons, you know, it's like such a...  Right.  It's kind of a mystery to most of us.  You just hear about, oh, they're really strict out there, and I don't know much about  their religion.  It wouldn't surprise me if it's Christians.  There's some guy that's going to be next to God.  How's it going again?  How's it going again?  Well, they believe that, you know, you get your...  What's his name?  You know, I try not to listen too much.  I mean, literally, it's funny because when I did go to church, I would beg my girlfriends  that weren't in the church to come with me because it was so boring. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  And then rumors started that I was a lesbian.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And I'm like, well, I'm kind of bisexual.  You know what I hear?  The Amish give great blowjobs.  It's true.  I don't know.  It's a good guy that's now going to be next to God.  Right.  They get their own kingdom.  What the hell's his name?  Help me out.  Is it Joseph Smith?  No, I don't know.  Something Smith.  Something Smith, yeah.  Joseph Smith.  Joseph Smith, right.  Okay.  Oh, Joe Smith.  And you're dancing, like, a lot of Club Rouge, which is where? 
[02:54:00]  In Long Island.  It's Masspath, Long Island.  Masspath.  Do you guys know that place?  That's Queens.  No, Masspath is...  Oh, it's Queens?  Yeah, that's Queens.  Oh, what a...  I want to come down and see Bella Dada.  Yeah.  There's one other thing I want to ask you, political correctness.  This sounds crazy when you're talking about porn.  Okay.  But it's affecting everybody.  Like, the radio world, they're sick of us talking about.  But what has changed in the porn world with this whole political correctness thing?  Like, you said when you first started in porn, there was a lot of drugs. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  And the girls were on drugs.  It's obvious when you look at older porn tapes.  What other things have come to your business as far as political correctness things?  Oh.  I don't know.  Has it...  More testing...  Well, you know what?  I encourage that.  Well, yeah.  That's a smart thing.  Well, I'll tell you what.  When I first started doing porn, there was only testing for HIV, which was ridiculous.  Well, I mean, I'm happy about that one, but there's so much other stuff that goes around. 
[02:55:00]  Why not test for that, too?  Yeah, what about lonely old chlamydia?  Yeah.  No respect anymore.  I think I had that a couple of times and didn't know it.  You know, it's funny, because guys don't know it.  No.  Girls, no.  I was pissing, and it was really uncomfortable.  You want to talk about unpleasant.  What, were there a bunch of men around?  Yeah, and I couldn't get rid of the erection.  No, I was peeing, and I called Dr. Steve because I was in a relationship at the time,  and I had strayed, and it was burning, but there was no pus. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, I'm like, could that have been some idiot?  I don't know what it was.  I took some stuff, and it went away.  Hey!  You could all die for this.  Tee hee!  Oh, better now!  Tee hee!  You're taking some of his wine.  I'll cure anything.  Wow, you got some nice boobies.  Aw, thank you.  Yeah!  Very nice!  How'd you get that?  You're good.  He's the fucking best.  Oh, my God.  I'm so shy.  You know what's good?  You're natural there, right?  It's all natural.  No, yes, I'm still all natural.  Yeah, that is fantastic.  Well, good for you.  There's no need to fucking distort beautiful tits. 
[02:56:00]  I hate that.  That's one of my, for my production company when I direct, I only hire girls that are all  natural.  Yeah.  There's something like that.  Ka-chum, ka-chum, ka-chum, ka-chum.  We call it the ka-chum, ka-chum.  When the shirt comes off.  And it bounces.  And it gives that natural bounce.  Yeah.  Not just sticking out of fucking...  No, I agree.  ...cock-eyed fucking nipples.  Isn't that horrible?  No.  When you see girls.  Holy shit.  Now you're naked.  Oh, good God.  Wow.  Oh, I remember the day.  You have a nice shirt.  Look at how small my butthole was.  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  I always look at it and I'm like, oh.  It gets so big so fast.  It's so tight.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  It's so funny.  Is that your first one?  Really?  That was my first movie.  Sexy shit right there.  That was before the Invisalign, too.  That space between your teeth is ridiculously sexy.  You like it?  Yes.  It's a little bit smaller than it used to be.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  It's so cool. 
[02:57:00]  We're watching just a little blood job scene.  I got better.  That was pretty good, though.  You got better?  This was your first one on film right here?  That was my first one on film.  Yeah.  That's your first one on film.  Wow.  I'll see you.  Jesus Christ.  I think if you like to please, it shows.  Oh, my God.  This is the great part about that.  It looks like a real girl enjoying it.  It doesn't look like there's a rifle being held to someone's head.  That's fucking really sexy.  Or so is the rifle. 
[02:57:30]  I'm not saying that doesn't have a place.  I was making love to it.  Yeah, you really were.  Wow.  You are sucking that cob.  That is amazing.  That is a really good blow job.  Thank you.  It's nice to have a girl who doesn't mind her clips being up.  Oh, really?  Because we had a couple girls coming in.  Yeah.  They freak out about it.  I think that's what I was getting at with the political correctness.  Some of the girls that do come in here, they're taking themselves way too serious  now.  Way too serious, yeah.  It's like, come on, man. 
[02:58:00]  When you say porn star instead of adult film star, they get really mad.  They walk off our show.  Yeah.  But are they like contract girls?  I mean, because...  We've had the best of the best.  We call them fuddy-duddies.  Yeah.  Because I think a lot of girls like myself who do gonzo type porn, they don't care what  you're called.  Right.  You're just fun.  That's what you're doing.  That's right.  Fun girls.  That scene is fantastic.  I'm so glad.  God damn.  Although, I wasn't as shy in that one because there was just two guys there, but the more 
[02:58:30]  people were on set, I was a little bit more timid at first.  The more shy.  Yeah.  You're a...  Fuck, what was I going to say?  Technique?  No.  No, no, no.  Yeah, it really is applause worthy.  No, I had a question.  I forgot what it was.  I guess that tends to distract a person.  Yeah.  None of us have a fucking...  That's a really loving blowjob.  That's fucking...  You don't see that.  And that was the first one to ever be inspired like that.  Oh, no.  Now he's licking your pussy.  Here we go.  Uh-oh.  What's going to happen now?  You know what I hate is when I don't like the way guys in porn eat. 
[02:59:00]  Well, sometimes they just...  You know why it's all about visual things?  Yeah, I know.  Sometimes you just want to fucking cover your whole mouth over there like a plunger.  Yes, exactly.  Yes.  You can't cheat to like show the viewers.  Yeah, you can't show.  You just want to like suck on it.  Some of the shit that feels the best...  Yeah.  ...doesn't look the best in porn because, you know, it feels great shooting inside a girl.  Right.  And then, you know, you got to pull out and do the money shot.  Right.  And then eating bots like that, of course, you got to fucking get your whole face involved.  My fucking... 
[02:59:30]  My face looks like that woman that was attacked by the chimp after I fucking...  I swear to God.  Fucking my eyes are missing and I fucking don't have a nose like that.  Let me say hi to Dan in Ohio.  They're going nuts.  We got Belladonna in studio and she's...  Yeah, right on.  We love her.  Enter belladonna.com.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Is...  Donna?  Can you...  Can you hear it?  A little bit.  Yeah, he's talking to you.  Oh, hello?  Go ahead, Dan.  Yes, I have one hand on the wheel and I was just wondering if I could have you say, 
[03:00:00]  Dan, shove your fucking face in it.  Dan?  Now.  Shove your fucking face in it now.  Oh my God.  What?  Oh, shit.  He hit an abutment.  Wow.  I got...  I just got a request from my brother-in-law.  Oh.  Look at the requests are coming in.  Could you say...  For real.  His brother-in-law requested that you fuck Jim Norton.  Jim, you don't flirt with me too much.  I like when you flirt with me.  Oh.  Yeah, these two are friends.  We're friends. 
[03:00:30]  I feel like, you know, she's my friend.  I don't want to be a dick.  This is my wife's brother for real.  Okay.  You've got great friends.  I've got Joe Curry.  That's a stupid joke.  That's a stupid joke.  You're his favorite porn star.  Oh, that's nice.  And he just wrote, tell her I love her and I want her panties now.  Mmm.  Damn.  Can we get that done?  Do you want me to give you my panties?  Yeah.  Yes.  For real.  Sure.  I'll do that for you.  I'll make Kenny fucking FedEx the panties down to Philly in a second.  I will do that.  See Kenny off on the side of a road somewhere with panties on his face asleep.  Sorry, GH.  Make it to the state line. 
[03:01:00]  The state line.  I'm not even kidding.  I need your panties now.  I have ice cream cones on them.  Yeah?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, he'll love those.  He said that you guys have spent a lot of time together.  I hope so.  Yeah.  And we have Big A here too.  We do.  We have a guy.  He's a huge part of our show.  He's up.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Here it is everybody.  We'll get to the Big A in a second.  This is the Big A for the first time ever.  That is the anal scene.  And it's slow. 
[03:01:30]  The head is going in.  And this guy's doing it nicely.  He's not doing a piece of shit.  Luckily.  He's kind of pushing it in and pulling out like a real slow.  Not working it like an oil derrick, which would have probably hurt.  Because there are guys that try to hurt the girls.  Yeah, I was so nervous.  Wow.  Wow.  Did you, before you did this scene, did you kind of, did you enema or did you do preparation work?  This is the whole good thing I had a vibrator.  I don't remember that.  The good thing is that people kind of just handed me the box.  And I didn't really know what it was. 
[03:02:00]  Never heard of it before.  So I'm looking at the side of the box like, how am I going to do that?  I know a lot, a lot better now today.  A lot more now.  Because I don't know how, I mean I know many.  She drank it.  Some girls haven't done that.  Really?  Yes.  Is that ridiculous?  Like read the directions.  What a great date though.  Someone that drinks an enema.  Here you go.  That's actually not bad for my person.  Fantastic.  We want to see your face though.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Look at me.  I'm like, ugh.  Yeah, you're like, wow.  I mean, I definitely remember it being like.  It doesn't look like, it doesn't look like you're breathing a lot right now.  You're not breathing a lot.  I'm looking at her.  She's not as a real man.  You're not enjoying it that much.  I'm like, ugh.  No, I'll tell you what.  It took me about a year, a year and a half to really be able to like, get off.  Yeah.  I mean, it was, it's so tight for the first year and a half that, I mean, and I was going  from that to like, large.  It took me about a minute to get off if I could get this fucking video and all of it. 
[03:03:00]  I literally would have came as soon as her name showed up on the contract.  But this, this guy is a, I mean, it's a porn dick, but it's not like, it's not like.  It's not massive.  Right.  It's not like anything that would kill you.  And he's not going balls deep.  No, he was very generous.  What a gentleman.  To me, that's sexier than a lot of what is done in porn.  You like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, because it's real.  Did you take a Sharpie and draw a line on his penis and go, no further than this?  Yeah.  Because he has been very considerate.  It's like a chart where the kids draw over him.  I mean, he put like a marker.  Oh, Uncle Paul. 
[03:03:30]  Let's go to Brad in Cleveland.  He's got a very good observation.  Go ahead, Brad.  Hi, Brad.  So, you bastards, you know, I don't understand.  I'm used to hearing just Anthony going goo-goo for the girls, but now I got all three  listening goo-goo-ga-ga for both on us.  Yeah.  This is crazy.  That's amazing.  Yeah, everyone loves you.  Well, she's so hot and sexy, but it's like a real person because that's what she really  is.  It's not funny.  This is a real girl having fucking sex.  I kind of like her.  It's fantastic.  I like her smile.  I like the space between her teeth.  Aw. 
[03:04:00]  Thank you, guys.  I brought some gifts.  I brought some gifts.  And those fucking eyes don't hurt either.  No.  And you're what?  Enter Belladonna on Twitter.  Enter Belladonna.  Oh, yes.  Twitter.com slash Enter Belladonna.  I'm going to start following you.  Please do.  I'm following both of you now.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Can we get Big A in here and do something?  Yes.  We have a guy who just wants to meet me.  He's been here since 6 o'clock this morning.  He's on Twitter.  I think I saw his name.  Oh, did you really?  Big A614.  Well, yeah.  I didn't know he was coming in, though.  He's sweating bullets because he's, you know.  He sweats a lot.  He's kind of a large man. 
[03:04:30]  He's kind of a large man.  We should have Big A talk dirty to Belladonna.  It could be terrific.  We had Big A write something up.  Oh, you did?  You did.  That was Danny's brilliant statement.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Ladies and gentlemen, Big A.  Big A.  How you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  I saw you on Twitter.  You did?  Yeah.  What do you come from reffing a fucking football game?  This is very dressed up for Andrew.  It really is.  You dressed up for Belladonna?  Of course.  Aww. 
[03:05:00]  And she's your favorite?  Yeah.  She is.  That didn't seem too confident about that.  No, no, no.  He's already frightened.  Oh, no.  Vertical stripes.  No.  No, that's the way you're supposed to do it.  Horizontal's the bedroom.  No, no.  No stripes on him at all.  None.  Okay.  Because, you know, it kind of...  Like, you ever see those maps of what the universe looks like when there's a mass  in it that's invisible?  Oh, I see.  It's like a grid with...  Yeah.  He's a visual representation of mass. 
[03:05:30]  Yes, mass.  There's supposed to be straight lines, but they kind of push out at times.  What he's doing?  Hey, what is he doing to you?  That's not nice.  Hey.  Don't you choke her.  He has his hands around...  Well, I was doing that the first day.  God, Dan, that's your first day on the job.  Oh, God.  Bella's standing up, and she's got her hands on the bed, and the guy is standing up  behind her, but again, fucking her, but not brutal.  Totally slapping me.  And he has his hands around her neck.  Wow.  That was a little slap in the cheek.  I know.  And the breasts are jiggling.  I carry it.  That's so cool to watch.  The only natural tits move like that, by the way.  They're fantastic. 
[03:06:00]  Like I gotta tell any of you guys.  Yeah.  By the way, by the way, only natural tits move like that.  Thank you.  Make sure you get that true coat.  What an ass.  What's that guy doing nowadays?  Chris Cannon.  I don't know.  Is he still doing movies?  You know, he could be, but I haven't shot with him since then, I think.  Wow.  Are you doing...  Now, you're smart.  She's one of the really smart performers, because you have your own company, and you're  in charge of your own stuff, which is the way to do it.  Are you doing still all stuff, or are you only doing girl-girl stuff now? 
[03:06:30]  I do boy-girl and girl-girl.  I do one every other month.  Oh, okay.  And sometimes I do one with both.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Nice.  Andrew, what do you got?  Andrew.  Actually, well...  Oh, look at me.  Oh, he's so cute.  He brushed his hair and everything.  Look at you.  And don't ask for her panties.  They're mine.  You're mine.  Yes.  Okay.  I can have mine if you want.  I can't leave here without her panties.  I'll pass on that. 
[03:07:00]  I'll pass on that, Jimmy.  Okay, so what do you want to say the bell?  What are you doing?  First of all, tell her what you're doing.  Oh, um...  Should I ask questions first?  Holy shit, you wrote something down?  Can we see your handwriting?  Quickly turn it around.  It looks like something I saw in forensic files last night.  Holy shit!  That is the writing they find.  That's the next clue for where the next body will turn up.  Yes!  Yes!  Look at it!  Holy shit!  Oh, that's so sweet.  Okay, guys.  What did you want to ask Bella?  We told Andrew because... 
[03:07:30]  He's going to meet her.  He's going to be nervous.  So, like Danny said, why don't you write up a list of questions for Bella?  Yeah.  If you could ask her.  Um...  The first question is, do you rather direct or acting in movies or both?  Both.  Oh, one word answer.  Nice.  Well, he gave her kind of multiple choice.  Yeah, it was.  Kind of a multiple choice.  He didn't say follow up or show all work.  Good. 
[03:08:00]  Good question.  Okay, question number...  Two.  Right.  It's not like words.  She makes you know that she's beautiful.  She's beautiful.  There.  Um...  Why do you like doing black guys so much?  Why do I like doing black guys so much?  Black guys so much.  Um...  Because they're sexy.  Oh, boy.  Sorry, Ant.  You just lost Ant.  But Jimmy and I will continue to...  No, I'm watching this the first one.  You still got too much. 
[03:08:30]  You still got too much.  You still got too much.  Ant would turn into the cuckold, the fessing kid.  Ant would actually go, I can't believe I'm servicing a black ball.  Do you rather do girl girl scenes or avoid questions?  Both.  Okay, um...  How about...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  How about a follow up question?  That's what interviewers do.  So you got the initial question and then you do a little follow up on your own. 
[03:09:00]  Or read the next question.  Wow.  You have...  This is Bella Donna.  She's not just some...  She's the biggest.  She's the biggest in the business.  The biggest.  You have her ear.  You have her ear.  Her ear.  Oh, her ear.  Yes.  Sorry, Jim.  Yeah, I heard wrong.  Um...  Wait.  Do you know how to squirt? 
[03:09:30]  I do.  With the right tools.  Oh.  You did that for Big Danny once.  Big I like squirters.  Which is the right tool?  Well, it could be fingers.  It could be...  A dick.  Well, anything but your cock, Andrew.  Didn't we have someone spraying Andrew's face once?  Yes.  It was Flower Tucci, I believe.  Oh, I...  Yeah, she's sick.  Yeah.  She got on all fours and went off like a fire hose.  Yeah.  Like civil rights footage.  Yeah.  Kids run through her in Harlem in the fucking summer. 
[03:10:00]  So, yes, Bella has had a squirt with the right gentleman, Frank.  Okay.  Um...  Do you have trouble coming up with amazing things to do on screen that will amaze your fans?  I haven't had any problems so far, but that doesn't mean it will happen one day.  Oh.  What do you consider amazing, Andrew?  I'll help you.  Oh, that's fine.  Tell Bella what you've seen her do that you thought was amazing to amaze you as her fan.  Yeah, what did you see that was amazing amazing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just always trying, you know, to push the limit in. 
[03:10:30]  Um...  Uh, uh...  Something that was incredible with the time she got from doing this is a fart.  Yeah.  Yes.  Ah!  Fisting!  You like fisting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Ah, fisting.  Yeah.  You like fisting?  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Of course you do.  Now, did you see the clip between Jenna Hayes and myself?  No, I haven't.  Two fists.  I'm not having a chance.  Wait, two fists and who?  Two fists and me.  Wow.  Well, one in each.  What?  She has small, pretty hands.  I think I have some free clips for you guys.  I have a bunch of freebies for you.  What the hell?  You can watch that now.  Now we're tugging.  Now, who's in this scene?  There's Alexis Texans.  This is one of my favorite scenes, by the way.  You like it, yeah?  Oh, dude, discovering Alexis Texans. 
[03:11:30]  I know it's not one of your DVDs, but you're in this DVD.  No, it is my DVD.  Oh, your company's DVD.  Yeah, but it's all about her.  I love her to death.  Dude, she's incredible.  Her body's amazing.  Bella put this guy's cock down to her fucking belly button through her mouth.  You went balls deep on that guy.  Well, his wasn't very long, but yes.  Oh, sorry.  You're talking to a room full of guys that think his is long.  Yeah, thanks a lot, bro.  Oh, no.  Jesus Christ.  Well, you know, for camera, you know, for camera. 
[03:12:00]  Thanks a lot.  We're all getting along.  I would actually apologize for my dick as I was getting undressed.  I'd be like, look, you know, I'm going to call it in here.  I'm not a size queen off camera, but on camera, I definitely am.  Oh, shit.  Danny was just handed something.  What do we got, Danny?  These are...  I'm not quite sure.  They're my dog tags.  I give them away for free.  Really?  For my fans.  And then you go to the website?  You can go to this website and you get a free clip.  My brother-in-law's going to need one.  Yes, I have a handful of them here.  Holy shit. 
[03:12:30]  Your brother-in-law's a big fan?  Well, fuck Call of Duty tonight.  The biggest.  Jesus.  I really have to leave here with her panties.  That's why I keep saying it.  You can have them.  I'm not joking.  No, I know you're not.  I have to get them.  Wow.  So this is Jenna Hayes and myself.  That's been like three or four years ago.  And she's behind you and she's inserting...  Here's the first one.  Oh.  All right, so the first fist is about to go over.  Some girl play.  It's just two girls having fun.  Hey, Big A, why don't you tell the radio audience what's going on?  Yes, explain what's going on.  They can't see. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, they can't see.  Color commentary.  Color commentary by Big A.  Yeah, take the mic out of the stands.  I'm Big A.  You're panicking.  Go ahead.  You're panicking.  Now get over there and tell everybody.  Now give us a, you know, rundown.  Okay, um...  Actually...  Mike, close to your mouth.  Okay, actually...  Um...  That was...  Figuring me a asshole now.  And... 
[03:13:30]  Go ahead, please.  We're all jerking off, Andrea.  This is good.  Hurry up.  Well, right before this, I was telling her how to put her hand inside of me so that it  wouldn't hurt.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Because I prefer girls that don't have fake nails.  Sure.  Yeah, I would assume.  Um...  But she did have them, so...  So she had to be very careful.  You need to be very careful, yeah.  Go ahead, then you've got to make your hand like it's a shadow puppet.  Basically.  Quack, quack.  Big A, go ahead.  Bella Donna is slowly fighting Denae's hand into her asshole. 
[03:14:00]  That's so awesome.  And holding on to her hand.  Yeah.  And pushing her hand in.  Right.  Wow.  What the fuck?  She does have very small hands, by the way.  Does that do permanent damage?  No.  I mean, you have to prepare for these types of things.  Wow.  Come on.  Two hands?  Two hands.  Now the other one's going to wear it, Big A.  She does a little bit of this. 
[03:14:30]  Big A, what is she doing now?  What's going on?  Um...  Donna Hayes is preparing to...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Well, forget it.  It's done now.  Jesus Christ, they're on the bus going home.  Everyone came.  It's done.  So she's preparing to what?  Jenna Hayes just did what? 
[03:15:00]  Started with two hands into her asshole.  Wow.  No, she's got two hands into her asshole.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  One in each.  One in the other.  And she's kind of going, uh...  Yeah.  She's moving it.  That looks like she's knitting.  It does, actually.  Thanks.  No.  You know what's so great about Jenna Hayes is that she has such a filthy mouth, but she 
[03:15:30]  doesn't look like she would say the things that she says.  Really?  Oh.  I don't know why I don't have the audio up.  Stretching in your ass like that?  Yes.  Yeah, you fucking slut.  You like to have all your holes spelled, huh?  Do you know what a bitch that you are?  Yes.  Huh?  Oh, my God.  You don't even care what slut you are, huh?  You just fucking want it, huh?  I do.  You just want it counting in your fucking holes.  Yes.  Oh, God.  I know you want my leg up, but it's just the cum that's fucking hole. 
[03:16:00]  I think that's crazy.  Jesus.  I'm shocked.  That's astounding.  We're all speechless.  It's like a magic trick.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That was the first time I had ever done that.  I fucking hate to cum like this, Bella.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I want you to cum from both my fucking hands fucking me like this.  Does she pull out a rabbit at the end?  I love it.  Surprise.  I love it.  Ow.  Look at that.  Wow.  That was so unreal to look down and see.  That's pretty amazing.  I love it.  That's a long distance from that first dick.  I know, right?  I got comfortable. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  It's basically, if you see the way you can see the little bend in the hand, it's basically  just a little bit beyond the hand, which I'm sure there are dicks a lot larger than that.  Yes.  Very large.  Shut up.  Again, we sit here emasculating.  Again, not here in this room.  Not in this room, but...  In your fucking cunt.  In your ass.  A language.  Yeah.  I have to squeeze really tight when I cum, so that's why I'm like, my legs are that way.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Clinch your muscles.  Yes.  Yeah.  I love that.  Show me what the fuck is.  He's got it, and down he goes at the five-yard line. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, wow.  Two for three years.  Fuck.  Aw.  You fucking whore.  Take it.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Do you feel good?  Do you feel good?  Uh-huh.  I'm trying to D.P. with my fist.  Oh.  Just like a guy would.  And that really felt good.  Yes.  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  Oh, my baby. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's all about the way you do things, you know?  I feel your pussy clenching on my fucking hand.  Huh?  And she has a vibrator on her own clip.  Oh, you fucking whore?  And I had to use my own fingers.  Did you like her talking to you that way?  I do.  I love her dirty mouth.  Like, ugh.  I'll fill every one of them up.  She's so good at dirty talking.  Yeah, she's pretty good.  She keeps going.  Yeah.  A lot of times you peed her out and go, ah, I don't want to keep her peeing. 
[03:18:00]  There's nothing worse than when you're like, yeah, do you like this shit?  And they're like, yeah.  And you're like, happy to hear it.  Did I ask you if you like this shit?  How much on a scale from one to 50?  Kevin got confused.  He thought you said, while you were up there, can you tie my tubes for me?  No, Kevin, that's not what she said.  Yeah.  What, are you getting close?  Fucking sweat? 
[03:18:30]  You're going to cum all over that hand?  It'll take a while to cum.  Yeah, cum.  Yeah, but that's because it's real.  That's okay.  Are you too much?  We can wait.  Don't worry about it.  No rush.  What else are we going to do today?  It's okay.  I love you, Howard.  Come on, take it.  Do you like that, Big A?  Take it like the fucking slut that you are.  Mike, Mike, what, Big A?  How are you going to let this pretty girl make you fucking cum?  I like you very much.  Are you going to, well, do you have a heart on right now?  Oh, jeez.  There's no heart on?  Come for me. 
[03:19:00]  Come for me.  Oh, this might be it right here.  Oh, come for me.  Yes.  Oh, jeez.  Yes.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my God.  I love the way she uses it.  Wow.  Now, Andrew, is that a scene?  What would you do if you were watching this scene alone?  Does that feel good?  Oh, my God.  Which one should I take out?  Kill a hooker. 
[03:19:30]  Bite a small animal.  What would you do if you were watching this alone?  I guess what anybody else would do.  Jack Wolf, I guess.  Okay.  So you like the hands are clean.  Both hands clean.  Hand comes out clean.  That's really sexy.  Ta-da.  Both hands perfectly clean.  Oh, well, you got to clean them off.  I got to clean them off.  Of course you do.  That's the best part.  Wow.  So now, Andrew, you've seen the double fisting.  And did you have other questions you wanted to ask?  Yes. 
[03:20:00]  What's the name of that movie, by the way?  A lot of people want to know.  Oh, God.  That was fetish.  Oh, no.  That's not in my movie because, obviously, it's fisting, so I can't put that in my movie.  That's only on my website.  Wait.  You can't do fisting now?  You can, but it's been prosecuted in the past.  That's what I mean by the PC thing, by the way.  Right.  Yeah.  There's a lot of stuff that I'm told not to do to be safe.  But, like you can see, I can put it on my website.  So what's the rule?  Is if you do it in a DVD and mail it out, like, Max got in trouble that way, and I think  Staliano got it.  That it's considered, yeah, I guess, trafficking. 
[03:20:30]  Plus, state lines.  I'm just wondering, like, who picks it up and maybe a mom and whatever finds it in  her son's room and finds it obscene.  Hot.  But on your website, it's safe.  Right.  So far.  Okay.  Well, it should be.  Yeah.  I mean, I hope it stays that way.  Exactly.  Everyone having fun in this scene.  So it's enterbella.com.  Enterbella.com.  I'm sorry, enterbella.com.  They can see that scene there.  Right.  And it's under Fetish Fnatic, too.  So they go there.  Big A, what else you got?  Got his papers.  He just dropped his papers on the floor. 
[03:21:00]  I'm so glad you like that.  That makes me happy.  Good.  Alexa, sex is unreal.  Me and my chick.  Very big fan of yours.  Oh, good.  She's actually quite jealous that I'm here.  Why did you have her come?  Was she working?  Dude, you know what?  I didn't even tell her.  I forgot.  Go ahead, Big A.  Big A.  Another question.  Close.  Right on the mic.  Yeah, please.  We can barely hear you.  Actually, I don't have any more questions.  I have other things I was told to write.  Okay.  I was told to write. 
[03:21:30]  Very sexy intro.  By the neighbor's dog.  Way to tear down the wall there, Big A.  Wonderful David Berkowitz reference.  Jesus.  Now, what did we ask you to write?  What did you do, Rocky?  I should write.  I did porno with Belladonna.  If you did a porno with Belladonna.  Yes, I did it.  Oh.  Okay.  It's almost like Voss doing that acting.  With Chaz Palminteri.  Yes, with Chaz Palminteri. 
[03:22:00]  Wait, so what is this?  This is Big A doing porno with Belladonna?  Yes.  Okay.  So what's the name of the movie?  Actually, I didn't...  All right.  Bella's nightmare.  I'm kidding.  Okay.  All right.  This is if Big A was doing porno with Belladonna.  And get right on that mic.  Yeah, go ahead, Big A.  Got to get right up on it.  Okay.  Yeah.  So we can all hear. 
[03:22:30]  Um, I guess we'll begin to be meeting in a bar and begin talking and hitting it off and getting friendly.  What year do you meet in this bar, 1950?  And I'm an investigator, see?  She was a lovely dame. 
[03:23:00]  She had a gap in her teeth.  We hit it off.  Nice pair of stems.  We begin hitting it off.  Hitting it off.  I ask if they had pretzels.  They say no.  They only have nuts.  I know.  We meet in a bar.  But they only have the dinner menu.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Go ahead, Andrew.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Go ahead.  Andrew's trying to not be a piece of shit.  He's trying to write actual scenarios.  My fault.  Go ahead, buddy.  I apologize.  That was disrespectful.  Lucky God. 
[03:23:30]  Jesus.  Then we go to a local hotel.  Was that one right after we hit it off, right?  Yes.  Okay.  You forgot to mention you take the subway.  Do you use your Metro cars?  Jesus Christ.  What happens?  I asked the cabbie for a receipt.  He says the machine is broken.  I say I need it for tax reasons.  Fucking lunatic. 
[03:24:00]  Then what happened?  I'm sorry.  We're all getting the sexual tension here.  I'm just trying to relieve it.  Go ahead.  Okay.  That's what you're trying to do.  Get me.  Oh.  Smile.  I'll accept it.  Fair enough.  You earned it.  I'll give big A rules.  Okay.  We go to a local hotel.  And begin kissing. 
[03:24:30]  And do some foreplay.  What kind of foreplay, big A?  Actually, he tried that.  Licking and sucking my nipples.  My nipples?  Sorry.  Licking and sucking my nipples.  Oh, he is Jewish.  Oh, my God. 
[03:25:00]  Wow.  Go ahead, big A.  Go ahead.  Let's see.  Big A.  Nipples.  I know.  And then big A says, let me have a deal of little sandwich.  Have I put my stack of dimes in her?  All right.  Go ahead.  This is great ice tea.  Guys, so she's licking and sucking her nipples.  No, no, I'm licking and sucking her nipples.  Oh, her nipples.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Very good. 
[03:25:30]  Then slowly going down to her pussy and clit.  And clit.  Yes.  As opposed to the clitless pussy.  Yes.  Well, everyone knows that because she travels, she carries them separately.  That's just the way it works.  It's a whole new carry-on rule.  It's very normal.  It's safer that way.  It's like the president and vice president not being in the same place at the same time.  Apologize.  Yeah, sorry.  Keep going. 
[03:26:00]  Then I give her pussy a lot of attention.  What?  Playing Monopoly with it?  What are you doing?  What kind of attention?  Yeah, you need some attention.  Give a little detail.  Well, uh, uh, lick and suck a, a clit.  Vulva.  And, and, and, uh...  Penis.  You just fuck her pussy. 
[03:26:30]  Hmm.  Our anus.  Was that supposed to be sexy?  And, uh, then, uh, then she sucks my hard cock.  Oh.  Ooh.  Oh, wow.  Salty of you.  It's hard.  Um, I'm too salty.  No, no, no.  It's perfect.  Okay.  No, no. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, that's good.  Oh.  Horno script.  You're doing fine.  Yeah.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Oh, fuck.  And then I would, then I would bend her over and fuck her, fuck her, behind hard and fast. 
[03:27:30]  Well, you're, so you're bending her over, you're fucking her hard and fast.  No, it doesn't know what to say or do.  The film doesn't fly off that reel after that and go, you're not done.  Well, it's like a really old film.  As soon as he starts fucking around the ass, it just goes, the end.  All right.  All right, so what happens?  You're having, you're having sex?  He said, oh, yes.  I can smell your cunt.  Oh. 
[03:28:00]  Who are you?  What the fuck?  You're in the bathroom.  Sorry, Andrew, they're kind of giving you the business of your sound clip.  Yeah, a little bit.  Giving you a little teasing.  So now what happens?  You're fucking up from behind.  Then, uh, because the, uh, uh, a blow, a load of become on her face.  Of become her?  What?  I said, I said, blow a load of become in her face. 
[03:28:30]  But you, you, you, you're fucking up from behind.  So how does this happen?  Exactly.  Now run us through, because that's the money shot.  Right.  This is the big ending.  Right.  So you can't just gloss through it like you did the rest of it.  Yeah, unless you plan.  Give us some detail.  Here's how it goes.  You're fucking up from behind.  Where are your hands?  What are you doing?  How do you pull out and spin around and, and get it on her face?  Unless you're going to ricochet off the television.  I'm grabbing hold of my hips

[03:36:00]  sorry  no it is  it is  it's wide open  they're having a very rough anal scene  it did have an opera pose there  Joe in Jersey  we got Bella Donna in studio  who by the way  let me just plug  she's dancing  at Club Rouge  Rouge's Gentleman Club  it's in Queens  New York  Maspeth  or Maspeth  how you say it  Maspeth  Maspeth  it's Thursday  November 12th  which is tonight  at midnight  and then tomorrow  the 13th Friday  there's two appearances  11pm and 1am  it's obviously rare  that she's on this side  of the country  I'm just going to do real well  doing an appearance  at a club  are you actually dancing  I am dancing 
[03:36:30]  it's a wonderful show  you're getting the biggest  in the business  dancing at this club  just three quick appearances  tonight and tomorrow  very cool  let's say hi to Joe  Joe  hey guys  I had a quick question  my wife and I  I started getting her  into a couple fingers  up in her rear entry  I really don't know  how to get to  like the next level  because I just  you know  how do I work it up  so that she really  is enjoying  well first of all  does she want it  yeah she really  enjoys it 
[03:37:00]  I always tell girls  to get a set of  toys that go up  in different sizes  and to just let them  play with themselves  for a while  while they masturbate  and then when they're  comfortable with a  certain size  then have you do it  professional  professional advice  on putting a fist  up someone's ass  this should be  daytime TV  absolutely  sex advice  with Bill Adonis  I got advice  because my girlfriend  tried to put a strap  on my butt  that's awesome 
[03:37:30]  yeah I felt it was  but it was a really  small one  but I literally  stopped her  we didn't think  the same thing  there  we had a different  reaction  my friends weren't  quite as encouraging  but she got a little  bit in  and literally got  maybe an eighth  of an inch  and I'm like  I gotta shut  I gotta shut  I gotta shut  so we paused  and I actually had  to run into the  bathroom and sit  on the toilet  and fart  I was so fucking  humiliated  I turned the water  on full blast  and I was like  are you alright  in there  I'm like yes 
[03:38:00]  I'm just a  I was like  I felt like I  let the team down  I know I did  so I don't know  how anybody  male or female  I just couldn't  but it's this weird  instinct you're afraid  you're gonna shit  and then like  they say just get  past that  and you won't  well I think a lot  of it has to do  with being comfortable  that you are clean  so if you take  you know if you  prepare  and you know  that you're clean  I have a very  strict regimen  that I do  then you don't  think about it  so are you saying  I made a mistake 
[03:38:30]  did you clean yourself  well I drank milk  and ate a bowl of chili  20 minutes before  I'm like this is  what we need  make up your mind  Jim  am I gonna fuck  let's go to  Serge in Canada  Serge what do you  got for Bella Donna  morning  hello  hey buddy  I'm pretty sure  on Foundry Music  I could be wrong  there was a picture  that you were pregnant  yes  was it planned  or did it happen  on set  no it didn't 
[03:39:00]  happen on set  it was planned  and I'm married  the picture  of Bella Donna  pregnant  I think it's  myself  and her  and her husband  for real  yes  and she looks  adorable  pregnant  and Steve  was at the  AVN in  2000  I hosted in  fuck man  it might have been  2005 or something  like that  I think it was  2005  and you looked  really cute  thank you  pregnant  with a little hat  how old  how old's your kid  almost five  now  wow  does she ask  questions yet 
[03:39:30]  well yeah  where are you  going  what are you  doing  but you know  it's not gotten  to the detail yet  which I won't go  into detail  but I have a little  sister who was  five  not now  she's 11 now  but she used to  ask questions  and she said  what do you do  and I said  I make movies  that only adults  are allowed to watch  and she said  oh kind of like  what mom and dad  do in the bedroom  when they shut  the door  and I said  I don't know  what your mom and dad  do  but maybe  so I'm  you know  I'm not afraid  to be honest 
[03:40:00]  but I know  that I'm not  going to go  into detail  obviously  did you  film any  movies  while pregnant  I filmed  seven scenes  all with women  and that's all  I was comfortable  with for myself  but it was  such a sexual  time in my life  and I myself  am attracted  to pregnant women  really  yeah  and I did  actually have  two girls  in porn  come to me  during their  pregnancies  and wanted  to shoot  scenes with me  so I shot  with Brianna Love  who's a really  big name girl  and Bianca Pureheart  both of them  were in about 
[03:40:30]  six months pregnant  it was very sexy  holy shit  you know who I  always loved  we had her on the  show quite a while  ago  I only know  she's doing  movies  she gave  really wonderful  oral treats  you know  Inari Vox  I do  she's still  doing movies  I'm not  I don't think  so  and I never  got to work  with her  I've heard  amazing  yeah she was  lovely  and we got other  calls too I guess  creepy guys  are they  well let me see  oh this guy's  girlfriend's  asses  on your website  Q in Ohio  oh yes  hey what's going 
[03:41:00]  on  hi  yeah I  got to see  Belladonna  at Fort Wayne  about a month  ago  it was so  fucking awesome  I ended up  going to both  god damn  shows that night  oh really  I mean if you  guys get to  go down  meet Belladonna  fucking great  show  I actually saw  a gym like  three weeks  before that  so like  favorite porn  star  favorite  fucking comedian  I got to  go see you  for a month's  time  oh you saw  me three  three months  before Bella  yeah I'm

[03:42:00]  and really  shitty  and you know  some people  in the business  are very jaded  but you don't  seem jaded  at all by the  business  I you know  when people  come to meet  me I treat  everyone exactly  the same  because I feel  grateful to have  people who  want to watch  my movies  like I said  I wasn't the  hottest girl  in school  or I never  I never had  that type of  attention  so I really  really appreciate  it  how many dummies  from high school  right now  are just going  wide  well I'll tell  you what  I dropped  out at 14  so I didn't  go to high  school  but you know  middle school  yeah  but I'm happy 
[03:42:30]  that I'm where  I'm at today  and I don't  have a high  school education  the business  ruins a lot  of people  I mean  it's a very  harsh  unforgiving place  I mean  a lot of people  get turned out  and sent away  depressed and  miserable  and it's like  very few actually  make it to a  level where  you really  legitimately are  a famous person  legitimately making  a tremendous amount  you know what I mean  it's like stardom  there's very few  that actually make  it to that level  I have a great  support system  and someone who  loves what I do  I think that makes  a big difference  yeah  you know 
[03:43:00]  having a husband  who loves watching you  a lot of people  that love what you do  buying the movies  we should get her  out of here  we have to wrap up  wait I need the  panties  oh yes I have to  take them off  but I have to  take my boots  off first  can I film it  you can  we are watching  there's a deep  throating of a  double dong black  dildo that has to  be two feet long  at least  and you are  sharing it with a 
[03:43:30]  girl orally  and both of you  are shoving this  down your mouths  the whole length  it's fun  why am I amazed  that you can  deep throat  wow look at that  it took me about  a year and a half  to be able to  get the fuck out of  you that's impossible  there's some trickery  that looks like  a boa constriction  that's pretty amazing  I'd be very  you know  you wouldn't need  that much practice  I don't know  what were you going  to say about  sucking a cock  no no no  I think I could
