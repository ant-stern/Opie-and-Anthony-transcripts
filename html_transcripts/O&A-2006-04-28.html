<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton and Joe Rogan, engaging in their characteristically vulgar and self-deprecating introductions.  They discussed the logistical nightmare of simultaneously broadcasting on XM Satellite Radio and terrestrial radio stations across the US, highlighting the technical difficulties and the humorous daily ritual of their mic'd walk between studios, accompanied by a bagpipe band, during which Jim Norton infamously purchased a "rude gay magazine" and cut in line at Starbucks.  The hosts recounted their recent guest, Pat Cooper, a comedian who "lambasted everything and everybody," and discussed listener reactions to the show's format changes, including complaints about the transition to the new setup and an apology from a listener who'd followed Jim Norton into a bathroom with a camera. This led to extensive bathroom humor focusing on Jim Norton's public restroom antics. They detailed their "radio warfare" with rival hosts Preston and Steve, sending them flowers and receiving gifts from WYSP in return, with Jim Norton complaining about his T-shirt and Starbucks gift card amongst the gifts received, including a limited-edition Ozzy Osbourne lithograph.  The attempted Empire State Building jump by a man in a fat suit and parachute was discussed, along with a lengthy recounting of a physical altercation involving Joe Rogan's friend, Tate, and a large intoxicated man in a Vegas hotel.  The show also touched upon the possibility of destroying or selling Howard Stern's old studio furniture.

Joe Rogan recounted several physical altercations, including one with a contestant and their spouse from *The Amazing Race* that escalated from the spouse punching Johnny Fairplay, a confrontation involving Rogan's girlfriend and a noisy movie theater family, and a road-rage incident involving Rogan's passenger.  A phone call with Megan Slater from K-Rock in Pittsburgh highlighted the positive reception of the show's move to XM, contrasting with the less enthusiastic response in Dallas (specifically mentioning Russ Martin).  Significant airtime was dedicated to Big A and Twitchells, with Twitchell's Tourette's Syndrome being the subject of several on-air bets and discussions, including a challenge to remain silent.  Big A and Twitchells attempted a news segment, showcasing Twitchell's struggles with words starting with "st". Bill Burr was also mentioned as being present in the studio.

The show's return to CBS radio was discussed, featuring Joe Rogan and Bill Burr as in-studio guests. The "Twitchell's Big A News" segment involved Twitchell's involuntary jumping, prompting much comedic reaction. A prank call to Kmart requesting a "butt plug," enthusiastic listener calls celebrating the show's return, and a cancelled celebrity fight between Joe Rogan and Wesley Snipes were also covered. A "Yo Mama" segment, facilitated by Bill Burr, featured a freestyle insult battle between Big A and Twitchell. Technical difficulties during the transition between CBS and XM radio studios were highlighted, including a humorous interaction with a street person.  A customer service voicemail from an angry individual demanding their camera back was played, along with further discussion of technical issues and the move to the XM studio.  The broadcast included Twitchell's unusual compulsion to eat Almond Joys until vomiting, explained in part by a childhood trauma involving his mother withholding Halloween candy.  E-Rock counted the Almond Joys as Twitchell consumed a large quantity before vomiting multiple times, the visuals of which became a focal point of the show's commentary.  A caller, Pat, provided background information on Twitchels.  Plans to post photos and videos of the event online were made.

A substantial portion of the show delved into discussions about masturbation, featuring listener calls sharing humorous anecdotes about being caught. The vomiting incident involving Twitchell and the subsequent cleanup were described in graphic detail, with photos promised online.  Callers recounted their sexual preferences and experiences, including a woman receiving fan mail from prisoners masturbating to a picture of her, a truck driver masturbating while driving, and another detailing a pungent sexual encounter.  A significant segment focused on Big A's trip to Florida to meet a woman he'd met online, with speculation about his motivations and the nature of his relationship with the woman.

A segment featured a woman undergoing a live breast reduction surgery in the studio, discussed with graphic detail.  The conversation shifted to unpleasant female body odors. Twitchells appeared, showing the aftereffects of consuming large quantities of candy and energy drinks. The show concluded with the playing of "Gangsta Fag" and a story about a man solicited for sex.  The entire broadcast was characterized by highly informal and often vulgar exchanges between the hosts and callers.

[00:01:00]  OVNM Media, XM202. 
[00:01:30]  OVNM Media, XM202.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounce back very quickly. 
[00:02:00]  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do?  Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding clutches with people.  You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well.  I just wish you well.  Wish you well.  Wish you well.  Push the button!  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow. 
[00:02:30]  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We eat.  Dank.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:03:00]  You're like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Eric?  My claws are burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:03:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Liar whore!  Liar whore!  And you know it!  Shut your goddamn pie hole!  Friday!  Friday!  It's Friday!  Fancy talk!  Fancy talk for a whore!  Freaking idiot! 
[00:04:00]  Hello, exactly!  Hello, exactly!  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony program.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Thanks to the XM Nation.  And now thanks to CBS Radio.  CBS.  Being heard on some fine radio stations across America,  including 92.3 Free FM in New York City.  That's where we're broadcasting from.  Also, YSP in Philadelphia.  Live 105.3 in Dallas.  WBCN in Boston.  K-Rock in Cleveland. 
[00:04:30]  K-Rock in Pittsburgh.  And Florida's new rock alternative.  103.1 The Buzz in West Palm Beach.  Keep them coming.  Keep them coming.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning.  Good morning, Jim Norton.  Hi, fella.  And good morning, Joe Rogan.  Hey, Joe Rogan.  What's up?  One of our favorite guests.  Love having Joe in.  Love being in.  Yeah.  How you feeling, man?  Better.  Voice is still a little crackly. 
[00:05:00]  But I get over these things pretty quick.  It's not like the AIDS or anything.  Get over it.  Over-medicate myself.  And come in like a trooper.  And then go home and read some message board stuff  about how I suck.  Isn't it wonderful?  She'll love message boards.  I'm going to steer clear.  I'm taking the Kevin Smith route.  We talked to Kevin Smith.  And he says he doesn't read bad things on websites anymore. 
[00:05:30]  So I addressed the unofficial website,  Wack Bag, last night.  And I said, I will return in June.  I am not coming back to the board until June.  Until all this crap is flushed out.  Because we did two shows.  Two shows.  And I saw one post was dated from, like, yesterday.  Uh, before we even did the show. 
[00:06:00]  It was, like, early, early in the morning.  So the guy heard one show.  And it wasn't even like, I'm sick.  First show.  You suck.  This is ruining everything.  This isn't what I'm used to.  You just got to give it a little time.  That's all.  I say scram.  Who needs ya?  We did five hours and 40 minutes of radio yesterday.  And most of it was good radio.  Most of it.  Most of it.  I mean, we're still trying to get used to this studio.  It's kind of a warehouse.  They're still building it.  Here's the people that get mad. 
[00:06:30]  They go, you know, I was there from the beginning of XM.  I go, oh, from the beginning.  We were doing radio a little longer than 18 months, my friend.  I think we know what we're doing.  Try 10 years together.  I think we know what we're doing.  F-ing years to go.  Don't worry about it.  And there's something going on every day.  They're changing my microphone every day.  I hate this version of the microphone thing.  What?  What is it?  I don't know.  That's what's so frustrating.  We're trying to get used to our new surroundings. 
[00:07:00]  And look, I got to crank this all the way up.  It sounds, this sounds exactly like our first day anywhere.  Yeah, I understand that.  Like our first week anywhere.  Those are some technical glitches.  That's why it's going to get a lot better.  I mean, we're very comfortable at the XM studio.  We're not going to lie to the people that are listening to us on the commercial radio stations right now.  Eventually, and I think within a week or two, we'll be very comfortable here.  But we still got to work out all the bugs.  I don't have enough mic volume.  Look, I'm pinned.  You would think they would figure this out before we got on the air, but. 
[00:07:30]  Turn your headphones up and you'll hear it.  No one else will, but.  And then we left here yesterday with the bagpipes.  There's a whole thing that's going on.  We got to explain all this to Joe Rogan.  He's been flying.  We're doing some hack stuff.  What are you doing?  To be just really hack.  But we're admitting that it's hacky.  See, that's the key.  If you're going to do hacky stuff, you got to admit ahead of time it's really hacky.  You can't play it off like it's cool.  Since this is new, no one's doing this. 
[00:08:00]  No one's doing both regular terrestrial type radio and satellite.  So we do it from two different studios because management is petrified.  They want to keep us under a watchful eye here on the CBS stations.  And then XM wants us over there because, you know, we're their guys.  You know, we're like a bitch with two boyfriends.  We're just being ripped apart.  But we have to take the walk when we're done here over to XM. 
[00:08:30]  And we've decided to mic it and walk down the street.  Yesterday, people at XM might have heard Jimmy Norton buy a magazine at the magazine stand.  Buy a magazine called Honcho.  What was it called?  Honcho?  Honcho, yeah.  It had nothing to do with girls.  It was the rudest gay magazine ever, ever.  And he's asking the guy, you know, do you have any magazines, you know, men, men and men, anything uncut? 
[00:09:00]  Do you have any unclipped gentlemen, do you?  Just being, just horrifying people.  But that's what we do now.  We, we, we're on air, on mic as we walk over.  And we had the bagpipe band as well.  So we figure we'll do like hack stuff during that time.  And, uh, we, we had bagpipe guys following us yesterday.  Down the streets of Manhattan.  Which is the most annoying instrument in the world, by the way.  Yeah, everyone was fleeing out of our way.  Then Jimmy hits the newsstand.  He picks up his copy of Honcho as the band's waiting behind us. 
[00:09:30]  And then we went into Starbucks.  There's a line all the way out the door.  And we bring the band in there.  And then Jimmy cuts some lady on line.  She gets really pissed.  And all Jimmy had to do was open up his magazine.  He shows her the centerfold of Honcho Magazine.  And all of a sudden she had no problem that Jimmy cut her in line.  It really is like having a Starbucks gift card.  Advanced to front of line.  And then there's fans along the way.  And they're waiting for us at the other studio.  They're waiting for us downstairs. 
[00:10:00]  It's become a three-ring circus.  And dopey tourists are taking pictures and video like it's something.  Like it's a real parade or an event or something.  Now it's like something we do every day.  Yeah.  Really fast.  We've got to say hi to John in New York.  John, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How are you doing?  Real good.  Listen, I'll be real quick.  I want to thank you for doing something yesterday.  But I want to make a point to the XM people that have been complaining that everything is no good.  So I want to say it in such a way that I make my point. 
[00:10:30]  I want to thank you guys for having that guy on yesterday who said all those things.  Pat Cooper?  Okay.  You want to do it like that?  Okay.  Yeah, Pat Cooper.  I didn't want to give it away to the free people.  Because, you know, maybe some people should cough up and start subscribing to XM.  And then they'll be able to get that kind of premium comedy that they're not going to get on free FM.  Well, so you have to tease it a little better than that.  You can't just say the guy who said the thing.  No one's running out and buying satellite units.  That type of a plug.  Wow, that sounds good.  In deference to Pat Cooper.  I mean, that's the way Italians talk on the phone. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, after we left here yesterday, we went over and did the XM show.  And Pat Cooper was in.  He did an hour and ten minutes.  We just sat and watched a master of work.  He just lambasted everything.  Everybody.  Everybody.  And everything.  He was incredibly funny.  I mean, dude, you're sitting there watching him going, I am in the wrong business.  I'm a chimp.  He was just really funny.  If there's a way for you to put together a montage for free FM, that's great.  Otherwise, I mean, guys, you're going to have to subscribe in order to get that kind of stuff.  I don't know how he walks.  Never mind coming on regular radio.  I don't know how he walks the streets with that attitude. 
[00:11:30]  He's a miserable, miserable old man.  Yeah, like he's just punching people in the mouth as he walks down the street.  Yeah.  77 years old.  And he doesn't care.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care, you love.  Do you guys find yourself like getting to certain subjects and go, oh, let's save this.  Let's save this for when we get over there because we can really.  Yeah.  It's kind of like a balancing act.  Right?  It really is.  You know?  Yeah.  And because the lawyers around here are really paranoid.  Like, you can't do that wiffle ball bat thing anymore.  We're like, we know.  That's why we got the satellite show.  We'll do that over there.  No problem. 
[00:12:00]  We really, you know, we want to.  We're trying and we're thinking of things we can bring here.  You know?  It's kind of, there are certain things that you just cannot do here.  But we're working on it.  Don't worry about it.  Like today, we got Big A and Twitchells coming in to do the news.  Yeah.  We could do that over here.  And Yo Mama.  And it's going to be hilarious.  Yeah, they're going to do that Yo Mama thing too.  What's the Yo Mama thing?  That stupid MTV show.  Awful MTV show.  That the kids are enjoying.  I've never seen it.  Hosted by the guy from that 70s show. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  The Ricky Ricardo one.  Yeah.  The hell's his name?  Rolder Valderrama.  Thank you.  He just bought Chuck Norris' house.  I was so bummed out.  Did he buy Chuck?  I didn't know Chuck Norris' house was for sale.  I would have bought that in a heartbeat.  Are you kidding me, man?  I met Chuck Norris.  It was like one of the happiest moments of my life.  I was staring at his wig and giving him a big hug.  It was hilarious.  But you watch the last guys look at him like he's gone.  Oh, dude.  When Chuck Norris came up to me and gave me this big giant hug,  I was like, I was in the family.  I was in. 
[00:13:00]  Chuck Norris hugged me.  Chuck Norris.  He, for some reason, is really taking off these days.  Yeah.  It's the internet.  Yeah.  All those Chuck Norris stories.  There's a whole bunch of Chuck Norris jokes and stories.  Chuck Norris falls in the water.  He doesn't get wet.  The water gets Chuck Norris.  There's like a thousand of them.  There's a whole bunch of websites.  So he probably paid premium price just because Chuck Norris is so huge right now.  Yeah.  He doesn't even.  In the underground.  You know, he doesn't even.  I don't even think he really realizes it's a joke.  I think he thinks it's like everyone's being like really nice about how great he used to 
[00:13:30]  be as a fighter.  I don't think he quite understands what's going on.  Chuck Norris, no kid anymore.  How old is he?  He's in his 60s.  He's going to be in his 60s.  He's deep in his 60s.  Did you tell him how bad the hairpiece is?  I didn't say anything.  I didn't think you would say anything.  Or nice.  Is it really bad?  It's not so good.  He's a nice guy.  You know, whatever, man.  You want to take that route?  Go right ahead.  I like seeing him do a spinning back kick, but his hair stays exactly in one spot.  He just spins beneath it.  Oh, that's really good. 
[00:14:00]  So, Joe, how does it feel being here?  It's hilarious.  Joe walked in.  I started laughing as soon as I walked in.  I'm like, this is like banging a guy's ex-wife on the internet in front of her mother.  This is like you guys being in the studio.  It's like this has never happened before.  This is the worst nightmare ever because you're on both.  You're not only on regular radio.  You're on the XM.  You've got more people on the XM, and you're on here.  And the whole idea about having David Lee Roth in afterwards had to feel good because  it was like, all right, we'll have this guy in. 
[00:14:30]  He doesn't know what he's doing.  He's going to make me look like a king.  Clear the field.  Oh, it didn't really work.  Yeah, well, this was the deal all along.  So when Howard was talking about revolutionizing radio, Ant and I were sitting back going, just  wait till you hear what we do.  This is revolutionary, and we're doing it in your house.  It's so perfect because you're still doing the other show.  I mean, it's both.  Yeah.  It's perfect.  It's exactly like when Tony Montana had Frank killed and just moved into his house, took  his chick.  The pests must have run the business out of his house. 
[00:15:00]  The ONA pests.  Alvira's womb being barren.  Yeah, the ONA pests are very happy at what has occurred.  Nobody has fans like you guys do.  No, they're rabid.  I was in Denver.  I was recording a CD, and as soon as I got up on stage, someone yells out, ONA party  rock!  So I left it on the CD.  It was awesome.  Oh, did you really?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks, Joe.  Yeah.  Did you want to choke the bastard?  No, no, it was great.  They didn't heckle after that.  It was just a fun thing.  You know, it was just, it was all right. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, because some comics come on the show, and people like Brian, Brian Regan, who is  very funny, does a very clean act, but it's not really much, he doesn't work the crowd  or anything.  He's just a funny guy.  And he does his act, and some of our dopey fans will be, do the big yellow ones to Sun,  which is like a punchline to one of his jokes.  No, I can't do that.  No, I can't do the joke.  We have animal fans.  It's all annoying when to heckle, you know? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  While the sip of water is taking place, that's a good time.  I don't like the hecklers at all.  They annoy me.  It's all different kinds of hecklers.  They're attention whores.  Most of them, yes.  Most of them are useless.  And you didn't pay to come in and see them or hear them.  And God forbid they do get one funny good line off, then they think they own the place,  and they're obligated to do it ten more times.  I get a heckler's good, though.  This one guy heckled me, and I got him so good.  I just went, could you keep it down to a dull roar?  Oh, Jimmy. 
[00:16:30]  Easy.  Easy.  Must have set the joint on fire.  You guys were talking about Charlie Murphy, who's the only guy you've ever saw get bested  by a heckler?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't remember anymore.  I was in the audience, and some chick was just giving him the business.  And he couldn't take it.  I mean, it was cringeworthy.  Everyone started cringing, like, oh.  You know, he went after it first, and then by the end of it, he was destroyed.  Destroyed.  I think you left the stage early, as a matter of fact.  Ooh.  I got ruined by a heckler in a wild wood years ago. 
[00:17:00]  I was doing Club Casbah, and this guy turned out at the end, he was really funny, and he  was smashing me.  I'm on stage, and he's yelling, stand up.  I mean, the whole crowd is rolling.  Oh, God.  That is funny.  Oh, he smashed me.  And I talked to him after, and it turned out he was one of those guys.  He was a dunk clown guy.  He was one of those guys that just screams at people all day.  All day long.  He picks out people's faults and just harasses you.  A dunk clown?  Yeah.  What are the odds?  Dude, he was brutal.  How many professional dunk clowns are there?  A dunk clown.  You know, if you think of it, all the human beings in the country, 290 million people.  How many of them are dunk clowns? 
[00:17:30]  What are the odds of getting one of those in the front row?  A dunk clown.  And what an easy guy to goof on just for the occupation.  Yeah.  Like, shut up.  You're a dunk clown.  But then he could come back at you with 10 things.  But I didn't know that at the time.  No, of course, they wouldn't let on to the dunk clown thing right away.  You could hammer them.  We ran into one at OzFest.  Bill Burr did.  We have some audio.  All right.  Of the dunk clown comic or whatever.  Speaking of which, you know what we should do?  You know what the bid is?  Get a dunk tank comic in the dunk booth.  In Robin's old dunk tank? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  If there's anyone out there that wants to come in that does this as a profession down on one of the boardwalks in Jersey or whatever.  Just pop the mic up every so often and have them harass people?  Yeah, just have them harass people from the dunk booth over there where Robin used to do the news.  Honestly, that's all it is, is a dunk tank.  That's the dunk tank guy.  And those guys need security now.  Yeah.  People hate them.  People get so freaking pissed off.  You start wailing the balls at their face instead of the target trying to hit them. 
[00:18:30]  You guys know Otto and George, right?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  It's only a story once that Otto was on stage and someone came up and stabbed the dummy.  Yeah.  All he was on stage.  That's a true story?  He told this story.  He was actually in a park.  He was doing like a show in a park.  And he was bad-mouthing.  The puppet's ruthless.  Bad-mouthing some Puerto Rican guy.  And the guy pulled out a knife and stabbed the puppet.  And it hit Otto or George?  Whatever. 
[00:19:00]  Whatever.  George, I guess.  Hit George.  But it got Otto in his hand.  Stem right to his hand.  So we should do that, though.  Get a guy in the dunk booth.  Yeah.  Just have him abuse us all show.  To have Otto do it.  All show long.  Why not?  Well, it will be the first time anything negative came from that booth into this area.  That's for sure.  Otto and George, here's one of the funniest lines of all time about Oprah Winfrey.  He goes, I don't give a...  How much weight Oprah Winfrey loses?  She belongs on a syrup jar with a handkerchief around her head. 
[00:19:30]  I'm like, oh.  All right.  Looks like a wallet.  Yeah, let's go to Ian in Philly.  Ian, listening to us on WISP.  What's up, Ian?  All right.  Look at that.  I gave you a great intro and everything.  Ian.  Is it the phone thing again today?  The button thing.  Hello.  Press the thing.  Ian.  Am I here?  Yes, you're there.  You're on.  Greetings, brilliant broadcasters.  What's going on?  Fabulous hour and 10 minutes.  Possibly the best you've done since October 2004 yesterday with Pat Cooper. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, on the satellite show.  And for the satellite audience, we're going to replay some of that stuff in breaks.  Yeah.  Don't you worry.  So in case you missed it yesterday, you're going to hear it in just a few minutes, actually.  All right?  Fabulous.  Thank you, Ian.  Phenomenal.  Let's go to Will.  Will, what's going on, man?  Oh, hey.  What's up, guys?  So I just want to thank you guys for coming back to regular radio.  And also, real quick, Jim Norton, I went to see you over at the Comedy Cell a few weeks  ago.  I just want to apologize.  I followed you into the bathroom with my camera, and you kind of looked at me and said, 
[00:20:30]  oh, please, no, sir, not in here.  And I don't know if I embarrassed you, but I wanted to apologize.  No pictures in the bathroom, Jimmy?  Well, no, it was just that, like, he caught me peeking through the hole, and he was aiming  a camera at me.  He kind of looked at his unit and then looked at me and said, oh, please, sir, no, not in  here.  And I guess I kind of spooked him.  I didn't spook me, dude.  I think I had to go on.  If I have to go on, I can't take a photo in the men's room.  Usually, all you ever see of Jimmy in the men's room, if you're in the stall, through the  little crack in the door, you see his little lips going, psst, psst, buddy. 
[00:21:00]  Well, that was going to be a little help.  That was kind of like the whole joke.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  All right.  Hold on.  The lips is creepy.  Yeah.  Lips and lips.  See, that's what I added to it, was the lips.  That's the creepy part.  Although, if you've ever been in the bathroom, that gentleman got to share some time with  you in the bathroom.  The bathroom stalls.  Not here.  We have our own little bathroom in the studio, but over a satellite. 
[00:21:30]  By the way, I just crunched in there.  Did you crunch?  That's a no-crunching bathroom.  Did you really?  It's a no-crunching bathroom, because it's too close to the broadcasting facility.  But Jimmy will do horrid, horrid things.  Like, I'm a stall guy when I go into the bathroom.  I don't like standing at the urinal next to anybody else, because there's always gags  going on.  Funny, homoerotic gags going on.  Like, Jimmy will walk in, and like a three-year-old, just pull his pants completely down to his 
[00:22:00]  ankles and go like that.  And people walk behind the urinal of your cheeks.  And yes, people are like washing their hands, and in the mirror, you're just looking at a  grown man's ass.  It's horrible.  The best part, it's other people on the floor that have nothing to do with our show get  to see the same goodness.  Yeah.  Day in and day out.  But then, as you're trying to use the stall, Jimmy will go into the stall next to you and  start talking, which is, you know, fine.  I'm in a stall. 
[00:22:30]  There's a wall.  But there's a gap that's about a foot tall between the stalls.  And he will stop using the toilet.  And just all of a sudden, it's on my shoe.  It's on the floor.  The tide starts coming in.  I'm like, what?  Is the toilet overflowing?  No.  It's Jimmy just not aiming.  Just turn to the left and start talking.  Yeah.  The beauty is, like, talk for a second, and he'll talk normal.  And then all of a sudden, I know he's realizing what's going on, because I see the foot jerk  out of the way. 
[00:23:00]  Jimmy!  Nothing better.  It's great.  Let's say hi to Rob in Philly.  He's an awful man.  Hey, Rob.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I just come back to Philly.  I've been gone for a little while.  I turn the radio on.  And you guys.  I don't know who you guys are, but it's not pretty funny.  What happened with David Lee?  We've gone over that.  He's done.  And we're here.  And we're going to make the best of it and do some great radio for you.  He quit, dude.  It was a whole thing.  He was drugs in the studio.  He had to leave. 
[00:23:30]  Jesus.  Now, tell him the truth.  Van Halen is reuniting.  And, you know, he got a great offer to get back with the band.  And so we don't blame him.  Oh, that's cool.  Yep.  So Van Halen touring all this summer.  I can't believe you didn't hear the news.  With David Lee Roth?  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  I've been listening to Howard Stern a long time.  And I moved to Philly from upstate New York.  And I listened pretty much to YSP all day long.  And I'm glad you guys are here.  You guys sound like pretty interesting.  And I look forward to listening. 
[00:24:00]  We're only temporary, though, man.  Actually, Michael Anthony has taken over full time.  All right, Rob.  All right.  You guys take care.  Thank you.  Speaking of Philly, really fast the ratings came out.  Yeah.  And we sent flowers to Preston and Steve.  Uh-huh.  So I have a little mission for the O&A Pest today.  We want to know if Preston and Steve got our flowers yesterday.  We're obnoxious asses.  What was the note on the flowers?  Well, we haven't been in Philly in, what, four years on regular radio. 
[00:24:30]  And Preston and Steve seem to be doing very well since we left.  Oh, wow.  You look tired.  Thanks.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  You do look tired, though.  You don't tell a hot girl she looks tired the second she walks in.  It's like a polite way of saying you look like crap.  You don't look like crap.  There's a difference.  Doesn't she just look tired, Joe?  Help me out.  She looks wide awake to me.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Under the bus.  If somebody was weighing about their prize that they got from Philadelphia,  then I didn't have to get up at 3 o'clock in the morning again to bring you another prize. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, Jimmy was so cranky and whiny that he got a T-shirt.  Well, WYSP, of course, we were there a few years back before we got the boot,  and they adored us, Opie.  Adored us over there.  So coming back to YSP, they decided to bring us some gifts.  So we got, like, I got a bottle of vodka and a nice sweatshirt just in time for the hot summer weather,  but thank you.  I appreciate it.  It was the thought that counts. 
[00:25:30]  It's the thought that counts.  And unfortunately, with Jimmy's gifts, there were no thoughts.  Jimmy got a T-shirt.  And a Starbucks card.  And a Starbucks card.  And felt a little left out and neglected.  And a pen.  Don't forget the pen.  That was an afterthought.  You pulled it out of your pocket.  Take the pen.  Just hand it to you.  Like, here.  Take the pen.  The astronauts used it.  I, uh, yeah, I just, I didn't care.  The Starbucks card was very nice.  I'll get a lot of use of it.  Yeah.  But the free FM T-shirt.  Well, yesterday, I walked into the station, and I see Gil on his hands and knees in the  promotions office.  I was like, all right, I'll just come back later. 
[00:26:00]  Uh-oh.  And I look, I'm like, what is he doing?  Was he with anyone?  Yeah.  And he was.  Was he under Sabian's desk?  Do you want to see your gift?  It's not fair anymore.  So they had to drive from Philly this morning for this.  It's an autograph that, I think he called it a lithograph.  Wow.  Ozzie.  Wow.  Oh, Jimmy.  Are you done complaining?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ozzie Osbourne, Prince of Darkness, lithograph.  Look, Jimmy's very happy.  Thank you very much.  What is this on, Ben?  Limited edition.  It's a, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Limited edition.  There's only like a hundred of them or something like that.  Limited edition.  There's a number, actually, on the bottom. 
[00:26:30]  They didn't have to give me that.  Put it over there.  No, they did.  They did.  You're a whining, spoiled brat.  No, I didn't want a special gift.  Yes, you are.  Whining, spoiled brat.  That's not true.  I only wanted a sweatshirt.  A sweatshirt would have made me very happy.  I'm not coming back.  I am not coming back next week, so borrow Opie's sweatshirt or something.  Thank you very much.  I can't tell you how much I like that.  Ozzie Osbourne on the top, Prince of Darkness on the bottom.  Ozzie's in the middle going, what do you want from me?  What do you want from me?  Can I go back to bed now? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, she had a reference.  What time did you get up, Tanya?  3.45.  3.45, just to bring your gift.  And you're ruining my sex life.  It's like, I have to get up all the middle of the night.  I'm like, I can get up in like an hour.  How did that ride?  Your sex life.  Yeah.  The guy's black.  It's not like he has to work.  I'm going to get home.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  Inappropriate, Bill.  Because you have to wait until you get home.  That can't ruin it.  Bye.  You say she looks tired.  I think she has that look like that just woke up kind of, you know. 
[00:27:30]  That's all I'm saying.  No, no, when you roll over after a nice night of sex and you kind of roll over, she's got  that glowing look.  That's because I'm looking at you guys.  Yeah, I'm looking at her.  She's like, Jimmy, here's your gift.  I'm going.  Bedroom eyes.  Hey, one other thing, Tanya.  So they delivered the flowers to Preston and Steve yesterday?  Do you know anything about that one?  No.  All right.  We sent flowers to Preston and Steve.  Nice.  Roses, what'd you do?  You do something different?  It was an obnoxious arrangement, like a huge, obnoxious arrangement, congratulating them 
[00:28:00]  on the ratings down there in Philly.  These radio wars really blow.  What are the cards there?  Because I know Steve.  I've hung out with Steve, you know, and we actually had a lot of fun.  And now I have to.  It's like the Civil War.  All of a sudden, I'm wearing the blue.  He's wearing the gray.  It's like the mafia.  What happened?  Did you guys have a problem with them?  Well, no, we're just coming into town, and now we have to beat them.  And now we have to just take all their listeners. 
[00:28:30]  That's pretty much it.  We have to take your listeners.  There's some history there, because our old producer went down to produce for those guys,  and a lot of our stuff ended up on his show.  Yeah, I met him through Rick, through Rick Delgado.  And actually, a few people that now work for us know them personally, and they would tell  them, look, there's a lot of the stuff you're doing coming directly from their show.  I just want to warn you now.  So we sent a nice flower arrangement, and we're going to now take all their listeners,  and I just want the ONA pest to give them a call and see if they got our flowers. 
[00:29:00]  That's all.  Rick is like the radio's bumblebee.  He just goes from show to show, cross-pollinating with bits.  He's actually a male flight attendant carrier.  It doesn't affect him.  He just drops it off all over the backs of unsuspecting Europeans.  And it's funny.  I know Joe is doing, you're doing AC, what, tonight?  Yeah, the Borgata tonight.  Nice.  I'm doing the Borgata in a few weeks with Atal, and Preston and Steve were presenting it, 
[00:29:30]  because Dave, it was his show first, so that's kind of awkward, too.  Now, I'm going to that show.  Are you?  I would love you to come.  Have you ever been down there?  I heard it's badass.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, man, that place is great.  Borgata is the only place to go down there.  You know what?  Atlantic City is kind of turned into, yeah, the strip itself, like the boardwalk on the beach,  no one's really paying attention to it.  They're starting to kind of build away from it.  Even the marina, they're kind of, and the Borgata is just.  They have a huge construction project right on the beach now that's going to turn that whole area around. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, but what, the whole, like, boardwalk area?  No, but what is it called?  It's like a huge mall with unbelievable restaurants and clubs.  That actually shoots out into the ocean.  Good luck.  They're building a lot over by where the Borgata is, and that's the area that's, like, kind of away from the riffraff and, you know.  I've heard it's like Vegas.  Yeah.  Like a real nice hotel in Vegas.  It is fantastic.  Borgata?  Yeah.  Yeah, you think you're in Vegas.  Wow.  So we've really got to take a break.  We're real late.  Joe Rogan's sitting in with us today.  How many hours of radio are you going to do with us today? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, whatever you do, I do.  The whole thing, man.  Stick it out, bro.  Don't, yo.  When we get back, we'll talk about the big story here in New York.  Well, I'm sure the whole country knows, the guy that tried to jump off the Empire State Building.  Tanya, thanks for the Ozzy Osbourne lithograph.  My pleasure.  Thank you.  Autographed by Ozzy.  Are you happy?  Because the show's all about keeping Jim happy.  Isn't it?  You say that in sarcasm, but I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I feel like a total dick now.  Yeah.  You should.  You should.  You should.  Sorry.  Look, he got you that. 
[00:31:00]  That is nice.  And it's fine.  Is that probably one of, is that your best piece now of Ozzy memorabilia?  It's up there.  It's signed.  My best piece.  Oh, it isn't even the best.  It's up there.  Do you want YSP to work harder?  Yeah.  I don't have to bring Ozzy back next week.  Do you want Ozzy just to hang out in your house?  Hello, Joe.  It's great.  It's your home.  That's right.  I don't want an alarm clock.  I want him to teabag me at exactly 515.  No, what it is, is my best Ozzy memorabilia, Jim Florenton gave me.  It's a poster signed by Ozzy and Randy Rhoads. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Which is ungetable.  All right.  That's amazing.  You can't get the Randy Rhoads one.  Well, we've got to take a break, so let's thank Tanya.  Thank you, Tanya.  You look like, thanks, Justin.  You look like Don Jameson.  Thanks.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  We'll continue in just a bit.  It's like punch sound, woman scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:32:00]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Wow, I don't know what's going on there, man.  Problem?  That level's way low.  Bear with us.  We're trying to figure out all the bugs.  That's weird.  And thanks again to Gil and Karen at YSP for that.  That's fantastic that Ozzy thing you sent me.  All right.  Thank you.  It's very nice.  Ozzy.  But it's nice.  It had to be very beautiful thing they sent me. 
[00:32:30]  I liked when they were moving the couch to make room for the rest of our guests, and  they almost hit it and broke it.  That would have been really fun.  Now, that would have just been the ultimate in comedy.  It would have been cool to see whoever did it flying through that nice window.  I hate that couch, by the way.  Yeah.  I say we drag it out of here and throw it on the street.  It is a memory.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, one of these days, I think we have too much stuff to do today.  We're going to play Howard baseball.  We got a lot of his old stuff laying around the joint, and we're going to just start smashing it. 
[00:33:00]  One person stands at one end of the studio here with a baseball bat, and the other person  is the pitcher, and you just wham, smash.  Everybody puts goggles on.  Yeah.  If the rest of the shows will allow us, I want to take a chainsaw to that couch live on the  air.  On his couch?  Yeah.  It's one of the old couches.  You should put that right in your bedroom.  You should bang your girlfriend on that couch.  That's what I would do for sure.  I would get rid of my bed, and I would sleep on that. 
[00:33:30]  All right.  I would take all sorts.  I would start a website of different chicks I banged on that couch.  Oh, that would be kind of cool.  I would just start posting photos.  That's a damn good idea.  To put it up on a website.  Yeah.  Are you crazy?  I mean, that's a piece of his soul right there.  If you're Rogan and you're banging tens, it's a good idea.  If you're me and you're picking up fat chicks and paying for Asian massage girls who could  be chicks if you look close enough, not a good idea.  Not a good idea.  Well, I had something queued up, but Ben just walked off with it.  All right.  Ben. 
[00:34:00]  What was it?  A mirror?  I hope this is fun to the new listeners as we try to figure out this whole thing.  No, we got the audio of the dude from the Empire State Building.  I had it all ready to go, and Ben just took the CD and walked away.  I don't know why.  What does the guy want to do?  Jump off with a parachute?  Yeah, it's on the front page of all the papers.  He's never been caught before.  Ben, that CD?  What CD?  Red Sox, dude.  Patriot. 
[00:34:30]  Kurt Schelling.  Ben called me up yesterday to explain to me what happened with Pat Cooper on the air.  I understood five words out of the three-minute conversation.  That's all you get.  That's all you get.  I was like, Pat Cooper?  Hilarious.  Okay.  Pat Cooper was funny.  I'm like piecing it all together.  He tries to call from, like, Fenway during a game.  And he does here.  Ben, who is this?  Ben, Ben, Ben. 
[00:35:00]  I think you have to come back to a time.  I'm like, oh, sucks.  I'm like, Yankee suck.  Yankee.  It's impossible.  I can't understand a word he says on the phone.  But he doesn't care.  No, he doesn't care.  He just likes talking.  It doesn't matter if someone actually listens to him.  The whole time he was talking, I was like, man, I wish I could record this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like, you've got to play this on the air.  This is ridiculous.  It doesn't matter if it's five minutes later, the same phone call is coming so you can pick  up what you missed the 30th.  What I like about doing the show from the studio, Ben's now in studio again with us. 
[00:35:30]  He has the best laugh in radio.  Best laugh.  I'm here.  I'm getting emails.  That's why it's the best laugh.  Go ahead.  Here's one from Boston.  Guys, every time something funny happens, I'm hearing a weird, awkward, annoying cackle in the  background.  Who is that?  And please tell them to stop.  Seems Ben's cackle is back on the air.  Again, our walls are bare over here.  They're rebuilding.  So there's no real acoustics in here.  So the echo, yeah, from Ben's cackle. 
[00:36:00]  It's so strange being in this room.  Yeah.  It is still tripping me out.  Because I was in this room on Howard at least six or seven times.  Yeah.  You know, and to see you guys in here now, it is just hilarious.  After all the history with the two shows.  It's the worst possible show that could have taken this spot is us.  The worst possible scenario as well.  Because competing satellite radio shows and you're on the one with the most listeners because  you have a bigger base, the XM base.  By far.  Two to one.  And we've been telling him, you're trying to get the message out to him, that if he 
[00:36:30]  has anything that he wants to tell the 95% of listeners that didn't follow him over  there, we'd be happy to pass the message on.  And he loves spinning everything.  You can't spin this one.  No spin.  You can't spin this one.  I'm sorry, but you just can't.  You just got to go.  You're just going to have to take this one.  Hey, Chris in New Jersey, what's up?  Hey, good morning, you psychos.  Welcome back.  Oh, thanks, Chris.  Thanks, my friend.  This is so cool.  You know, I just pissed off my wife because I'm living in Jersey.  I just quit my job in the city and took a job in Stanford, Connecticut, just looking 
[00:37:00]  to listen to you wax for an hour and a half in the morning.  And?  Yes, by O&A.  But listen, if you guys really want to piss off Howard, what you should do is after you break  up all the stuff, put all the stuff on eBay, all the broken bits, and sell it off as Howard  memorabilia on the internet.  That's not a bad idea.  I'm bad.  Give it to a charity.  I'll make some money and get a mad.  You know, there's a lot of shows used in this studio, so we got to be fair.  You know, we're trying to get along with everybody.  Yeah.  But if they will allow us, we'll take that couch, we'll throw it on eBay, or we'll have 
[00:37:30]  a little garage sale right outside the building.  Well, that'd be good.  A little garage sale.  Actually, we should get rid of the couches and just have CBS Buy.  We should buy new couches.  They're awful.  It's a horrid...  They're absolutely awful.  Gaudy red couch.  We'll have a garage sale one day.  We'll invite everyone down to the sidewalk, and we'll give this crap away.  We'll make a few bucks, and we'll...  No, we're not going to give it to charity.  We'll get some beer or something.  Who wants to dump on one? 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Thanks for that.  Immediately, you go to Jim.  Who wants to dump on one?  I didn't think I'd get fired.  I'd scrap on one.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  But you can't.  They'd probably dump you for that.  Well, we'll find out.  How's that?  Why don't we play the audio from the Empire State Building jumper?  And on the way, more news with Big A and Twitchels.  They're getting ready in the green room.  And here's something that stopped traffic yesterday for a little bit.  If you looked up, a real wild scene happening high above the ground right outside the Empire State Building.  Police are stopping a very strange stunt seconds before it can be pulled off. 
[00:38:30]  Patrice O'Neill trying to climb it.  This one involves a man, a parachute, and a fat suit.  This really was an unbelievable stunt, but it's nothing to laugh about.  The would-be daredevil's actions not only risked his life, but the lives of the rescuers he taunted.  30-year-old J. Ray Corliss of California thought he was going to pull off what no one had ever done before, parachute off the 86th floor of the Empire State Building.  His scheme was elaborate and expensive, a fat suit costing thousands of dollars to conceal his parachute and a latex mask to look much older. 
[00:39:00]  But the landmark building's security and staff, like retired NYPD Lieutenant Arthur Felder, soon caught up to him.  He went into the bathrooms, from what we understand, took off the fat suit, had this stuff on, and when he came out of the door, there's a railing there.  He bounced onto the railing, and with the next step, he was trying to go over the top.  How great is that?  You know what alarms me? 
[00:39:30]  You've seen how bad fat suits are.  There have been professional makeup people that have done this whole fat suit thing where they send a reporter out to see how fat people are treated on the street,  and they're treated awfully, and people gawk at them, and not because they're fat, but because the makeup is so god-awful bad.  It's just a bad fat suit.  But what kind of fat suit do you think this guy was wearing?  Do you think the makeup was good?  And security, the guy got to the top.  He got over the railing.  He should have been stopped at the door, thinking maybe he had some kind of explosives on him or something. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, he was ready to go, and they grabbed him through the grate, or whatever you would call that,  and they just held him until the cops showed up.  But they had to hold him for a while.  He was on the other side.  Yeah, he was on the other side, on the ledge, ready to go.  Have you seen the pictures?  Yeah.  Didn't Tyra Banks wear a fat suit to a trip club or something?  Of course she did.  How was that?  She did that.  She was like the third or fourth incarnation of the fat suit news story.  The big mama's house?  Yeah.  Big mama's suit? 
[00:40:30]  We're obsessed with Tyra Banks and how ridiculous that TV show is, by the way.  She's so self-important.  But here's the picture.  Yeah, he's ready to go.  He's leaning all his weight, still trying to perform this stunt.  He's got a camera strapped to his head, and I guess he wanted to do it.  No one's ever done that before?  They've done it off the Trade Center.  They've done it off a lot of the CN Tower in Toronto, which is not off the Empire State Building.  He was there.  He should have freaked out and just started spazzing.  Yeah.  That's a tough jump, man.  You've got to get some distance away.  That thing gets a little wide toward the bottom. 
[00:41:00]  You've got to pop that chute.  You've got to make sure you really do.  Otherwise, yeah.  You've got to pop the chute immediately.  I was wondering, because I was in the park yesterday, and I saw all the helicopters.  I knew there was something huge going on.  Oh, yeah?  They were just hovering, checking it out, hoping, I guess, that he was going to, you know, jump  so they get the good footage for the news.  Another idiot screwing up traffic where people have to work.  Here's more audio.  Maybe not.  Here's something that stopped traffic yesterday for a little bit.  I knew the other track.  Clinging to the six-foot-high railing, he peeled off the latex mask. 
[00:41:30]  Bragging that he'd never been caught before, he started yelling at his rescuers, who now  included a cop on patrol, an armed security guard, and another staff member, also a retired  cop.  Is that really rescuers, if you're trying to jump with a parachute?  No.  They're rescuing you.  You're the interrupters.  You're the cops.  Basically, how are you rescuers?  No, you're the C-blocker.  You're not the red friend who wants to go home. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, we'd be rescuers if he didn't have a chute.  Yeah, this guy's got a parachute and a plan.  You know, he's not rescuing anything.  You're stopping the funds.  So true.  And another staff member, also a retired cop.  He was resisting.  He was trying to push off with his feet as we were holding him through the bars to hold  him on to the top of the bus.  He was fighting with us to get off.  He wanted to jump in the worst way.  The struggle to get him down continued until emergency service unit cops arrived and had 
[00:42:30]  to take away part of the railing.  He was screaming and fighting them the whole time, putting all their lives on the line.  There are a lot of pedestrians that are walking underneath, and if that parachute doesn't  open, the worst case scenario is he kills a couple of people that are walking by.  The would-be daredevil is under arrest.  He's behind bars facing a long laundry list of charges.  They should have let him jump.  We need some excitement in this city.  Who cares?  How cool would that footage be?  My friend Eddie used to bang his girlfriend.  Are you kidding? 
[00:43:00]  On the couch?  No.  There's a connection in the studio to the guy that tried to jump?  The guy that tried to jump is dating this girl.  She's really hot.  He calls her Holy F.  That's like his nickname for her because he couldn't believe that he was actually doing  it.  I was like, wow, how did I get this one?  And he wouldn't commit because my friend Eddie is a pig.  Shocker.  He wouldn't commit.  He's not willing to commit.  And so he lost her to this base jumper dude.  Really?  Yeah, very recent.  Right there.  Eddie Bravo.  Damn.  He's an unofficial scorekeeper for the Ultimate Fighting Championship. 
[00:43:30]  You could kick his ass.  Right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Clearly.  Yeah.  For sure.  He's the only American to ever tap out one of the Gracies.  Is that you?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  He's a world champion jiu-jitsu guy.  I mean, he looks like a stoner, and he is.  But Rogan hangs out with animals.  He just hangs out with professional killers.  Everyone he hangs out with is a problem.  The death squad.  Yeah.  My friends are Steve and his staple stomach and Ben.  You're getting no help in a fight. 
[00:44:00]  No, I'm not.  Yeah, we really need to start hanging out with the tougher guys.  The best story I could ever tell you about my friends, Tate.  Yeah.  This is the guy right there.  He's from on the new season of The Ultimate Fighter.  Yeah.  We were in Vegas, and there was this big douche.  This guy was, like, 6'6".  Big, typical, like, frat guy, like, drunken asshole.  Ooh.  Oh, yeah.  Whatever.  Let him fly.  We don't care.  Well, actually, in the context of calling somebody one, I think you're all right.  Who knows?  I'm not talking about the actual.  Right.  Don't worry about it down the hall.  Go.  Okay.  So, anyway, this guy, we were trying to get to the door, and this guy stops him from 
[00:44:30]  coming to his door and won't let him put the key in.  He goes, hey, man, that's my door.  And Tate's big.  I mean, Tate's, like, 230.  What are you, like, 24?  Yeah.  I mean, Tate's a big guy.  This is not a small guy.  But this guy's towering over Tate.  And he's, like, that's my room.  And he's, like, no, man, I think it's my room.  And he's, like, being real calm, shows him the key.  And he's, like, yeah, no, that's my room, dude.  He goes, look, I'm going to show you.  It works.  See?  And he opens the door, and he goes in.  Take it easy.  Bye-bye.  And he goes in and shuts the door.  Well, we're in the room next to him.  We go in the room next to him, and we hear the guy banging on the door. 
[00:45:00]  Come on out, you pussy.  Oh, no.  He's, like, what?  And we're, like, what is going on?  So I tell Eddie to get off the phone.  So it's me, Eddie, and Tate, and this giant drunk guy and his friend.  So we're standing out there in the hallway.  We're, like, what are we going to do here?  Like, what's going to happen here?  The guy's, like, you want some of this?  I'll wreck you.  Look at you.  You pussy.  You this.  You that.  He starts going off.  And Eddie goes, you're the one walking away, man.  You're the one walking.  And, like, now Tate's, like, okay, now I've got to do something.  Yeah.  In the lobby of the eighth floor of the Hard Rock, these guys get into a fight.  And Tate goes, why don't you come over here and swing at me? 
[00:45:30]  This guy has no idea.  I mean, he doesn't know how to fight at all.  He's about to fight a professional cage fighter.  Oh, my.  And he has no idea.  He has no idea.  And Tate is calculating the whole situation.  Tate's trying to figure out, how am I going to deal with this guy?  So what he decides to do is, because, you know, there's a giant window there.  They're on the eighth floor.  There's potted plants.  And there's a lot of stuff that could go wrong.  So he kicks a guy in the leg and pulls him on top of him.  He pulls guard.  That's what it is.  He's lying on his back with this guy in between his legs.  The guy has no idea what he's doing. 
[00:46:00]  He throws his leg over the guy's shoulder and puts his foot in his face.  It's a shoulder lock.  It's called an omoplata.  So this guy is face planted on the carpet.  The foot is in his face.  He's, like, slammed down the carpet.  And then the security arrives.  And the security's like, what are you doing?  Break it up.  Break it up.  I go, don't worry about it.  I go, he's going to be fine.  I go, he's just going to go to sleep.  I go, he's going to be fine.  I go, he deserves this.  And the guy goes, you're the guy from Fear Factor.  I go, yeah.  I go, yeah.  I go, don't worry about it.  Just let it happen.  So the guy goes, well, what are you doing here?  I go, I work for the UFC. 
[00:46:30]  He goes, oh, yeah?  So he's, like, all excited to see me.  Meanwhile, while this is happening, Tate has shoved his forearm underneath the guy's neck  and is putting him to sleep.  And I'm in a rear naked choke and squeezing his neck like a pit bull.  And the guy's unconscious.  In the lobby of the hotel room, Tate climbs off of him.  And he goes, Tate, let him go.  Because he wasn't sure if he was out because his eyes were still open.  His eyes were open, but he was completely unconscious.  So Tate climbs off of him.  The guy's completely out.  His friends are apologizing to us.  His friends shake our hand. 
[00:47:00]  The guy gets up.  He has no idea what happened.  Because when you get choked out, you don't remember it.  You're like, what happened?  What happened?  So the guy gets up.  They push him in an elevator, and he leaves our life forever.  That was it.  I mean, it had to be on videotape.  The Hard Rock has video cameras everywhere.  Someone's got a video of that.  Oh, I was probably watching that and laughing their ass as well.  It's hilarious.  But how great is it that you're being choked out, and security shows up and gets celebrity  photos.  Yeah.  Your face is in a rug.  Immediately, they were like, you're that guy from Fear Factor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't worry about it, man.  He's going to be fine.  We're not going to hurt him.  That's great.  That's got to be something, though, to just be able to, like you guys, walk around the city. 
[00:47:30]  But you're not punks, you know?  You're not looking for trouble.  But just to know, just to have that knowledge that if anything happens, it's taken care  of.  Well, of course it is.  Yeah, a gun always wins, you know, for the most part.  All of it wins.  Bats win.  But I mean, you get somebody giving you a little crap on the street.  You know you can take care of yourself.  I'm dead.  I'm just a dead person.  That's why you carry.  Girls would kill me. 
[00:48:00]  But that's why you need a little armor.  This guy was the perfect guy to do it to, though, because he was a big, giant guy who  you know had been doing this his whole life.  A bully.  Yeah, for sure.  And it gave him every chance.  Every chance.  To get out of it.  He was super nice to the guy.  Sorry, look, it works.  See?  It's my card.  Take it easy, man.  Even said goodbye to the guy.  Get in and shut the door.  The guy's banging on it.  He just took it for weakness.  Huge mistake.  It was hilarious.  It was perfect.  If I had that fighting skill, all I would do is walk up to people and go, sir, is this  your girlfriend?  And when he said yes, I'd rub my hog on her knuckles. 
[00:48:30]  Now what?  Now what, sir?  Hey, where's Steve, by the way?  He just handed me audio of you, Joe.  You fought one of the contestants on Fear Factor?  What's this about?  Well, not really a fight.  There was a guy who was on that show, The Amazing Race, and him and his wife were contestants  on the show, and they were screaming and yelling at each other.  The whole time they were on the show was disgusting.  Like, yelling at each other, swearing at each other, like hateful stuff.  And they're in the middle of doing this stunt, and this other guy, this guy Johnny Fairplay  from Survivor, who's on the show.  I hate that guy. 
[00:49:00]  Well, the kid was hilarious on the show because he was taunting them.  While they were doing that, he was yelling at the guy, she's dead weight.  You can do better.  You can do better.  You deserve better.  And he's constantly heckling.  I mean, screaming.  It's horrifying to listen to because he's saying, you know, just the most ruthless stuff, trying  to get them to angry at each other.  And it's working.  They're screaming and yelling.  So anyway, they get eliminated.  They come off from the stunt.  And the girl, the wife, walks right up to Johnny and punches him as hard as she can right in  the stomach.  And he falls over.  And I go, hey. 
[00:49:30]  He fell.  You know, like he really got hurt.  I go, what are you doing?  I go, you can't go around hitting people.  I go, just because you hit your husband doesn't mean you can hit other people.  And then he goes, hey, hey, hey.  And I go, hey, hey, what?  And he gets right in my face, like right here.  Hey, hey, hey.  And I push him.  And he goes, I dare you to touch me again.  I push him again.  And then I'm like, what?  What, bitch?  What?  Because I think now we're fighting.  Yeah.  You know, I'm like waiting for him to swing.  So I keep pushing him, waiting for him to swing.  And then I grab a hold of him.  And then everybody piles on.  So it was never really a fight.  Like I never really hit him. 
[00:50:00]  And he never really hit me.  But I was trying to get him to hit me.  Let's check out the audio.  Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  You can't assault people.  What are you doing?  Oh, he, well, you're.  Yeah, he is calling strategy.  He's yelling at you.  You can't run up to him and hit him.  In previous shows, I've upset a few people.  I've ruffled a few feathers, if you will.  Victoria might have been the most agitated I've ever made anyone.  I mean, she punched me as far as she could.  I mean, she held nothing back.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Look, if you and your husband hit each other, that's one thing. 
[00:50:30]  You don't run up and hit other contestants.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  No, hey, hey, hey.  That's the lamest page of insults ever.  No, hey, hey, hey.  He got too close to Joe.  Oh, my God.  And then all of a sudden, they start going at it.  And I was like, all right, I got to break this up.  This Joe's going to kill him.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  And we have to go still.  My partner's crying.  This is the greatest reality show ever.  I would have to say that Joe Rogan is about 100 times tougher than Jeff Gross. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  No, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Because I'm thinking this is all still going to get on television.  So I'm trying to keep calm.  Right.  And he's in my face.  I'm like, how am I going to keep from killing this girl?  Like, he's inches from my face screaming at me.  I'm like, oh.  Yeah, because you don't want lawsuits.  And he's got this just, oh, he's just disgusting.  He was doing the protect his broad thing.  Yeah, after he got done screaming at her. 
[00:51:30]  So, yeah, he's screaming at her.  She belts some guy.  And then you jump in and mouth off to her.  So the guy feels now he's got to step in.  They were just the most disgusting human beings I've ever been around ever.  Chicks look at guys in trouble like that, though.  Oh, yeah.  So many times.  Where all of a sudden you're faced with a position where now you're fighting.  I abandoned them.  I abandoned them.  I will abandon them like a bad baby.  Yeah.  Girl wants to get in a fight.  What do you think you do?  Mike Blaine for the what?  What?  Who?  Bang.  See ya.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Just walk away like I don't know you. 
[00:52:00]  I love when they reach over from the passenger seat and start beeping the horn.  That's some ass on the highway.  Oh, my God.  There were some bikers.  It was in Philly.  Oh, great.  Bikers.  It was in Philly on, I think it was South Street.  And I guess the bikers in front of us weren't going fast enough for her.  So she starts beeping the horn.  She reaches over and starts beeping.  Now these guys are looking at me.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  It wasn't me.  Now you've got to go.  It wasn't me.  And I'm in no position.  What am I going to do?  Yank her out of the car.  What am I going to do?  Pull over and yank her out of the car. 
[00:52:30]  That's just another human being.  At that point in time, that's a liability.  What am I going to do?  Yeah, I had my chick once in a movie theater.  We've told the story before, but I had a movie theater.  And there was a family of Puerto Ricans behind us.  And I mean the whole family from grandpa down all the thugs down to babies.  And it was Mission Impossible 2.  And they just would not shut up through the trailers and everything.  And I'm just thinking, all right, it's through the trailers.  Maybe they'll shut up during the movie, which I knew wasn't going to happen. 
[00:53:00]  And it starts and Tom Cruise is like hanging from the rock and everything.  And one of them goes, oh, that's Tom Cruise.  Oh, I would do to him.  Let me tell you something.  Just really loud.  And my girlfriend had had it by that point.  She turned around and looks and goes, would you just shut the F up?  And this woman, this Puerto Rican just went, you didn't.  Oh, you didn't.  And her boyfriend, the Puerto Rican boyfriend turned to me and went, oh, man, she just put 
[00:53:30]  her in battle mode.  And I'm like, he's seen it before.  He's got a name for it.  I sat there.  And like the biggest faggot, I'm like, up, out of the theater, manager.  I need to go to another theater that's showing this same movie.  I need to go to the white theater.  And let me tell you, he goes, there's a theater over here.  It's starting in five minutes.  I walked in there. 
[00:54:00]  It was full of just faggot white guys that apparently had the same issue.  Oh, that's hilarious.  They had a contingency plan.  It's funny that the guy looked at you, too, and said something.  It was like, you know, he's like trying to feel out what's going to happen with you.  Yeah.  Oh, she's in Batamo.  Like, at least, yeah, I guess so.  Yeah.  Like, you can look over.  Well, that's what I did.  We're not fighting, right?  Like, I just met her, dude.  You know what?  Isn't that great?  Hey, we've got to step aside and take a break.  When we get back in the green room, we've got Big A and Twitchells to do some more news for us. 
[00:54:30]  Bravo.  Eventually, we're going to have listeners come up and do the news for us from the dunk booth.  Yeah.  We'll show you that anyone could have done that.  Yeah, we're going to show that that's the easiest job in radio.  But when we get back, it's Big A and Twitchells.  Twitchells has Tourette's, and he's just a classic.  He's got Tourette's in, like, obsessive-compulsive, and he does things like, if you say jump too many times, he'll start jumping.  Yeah.  So he's really a freak.  He's one of our greatest finds because we're talking to our old audience for the first time in, like, four years, and they're asking about all the old characters. 
[00:55:00]  They're old hats.  Some of the old characters are still around, but we've got a whole crop of new ones that make the old ones look silly.  You know what Twitchells is?  Huh?  He's an ass.  He really is.  I love when they do the news, and they're going to do that next.  So you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program more in just a bit.  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony laboratory.  Oh, my God, baby. 
[00:55:30]  Hey, guys, anyone want a bagel?  No!  No!  Stop ruining the show, Eric.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Feel the love.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  Yeah!  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes. 
[00:56:00]  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Bend over, baby, bud.  Bend over, baby, bud.  Oh, baby.  Oh, baby.  Dirty little skank.  It's a freak show.  Dirty little spank.  Oh, yeah.  This cake is so good.  Come on down and I'll feed you something.  Give me a...  Oh, no.  Well, you're very naughty.  You guys suck. 
[00:56:30]  And so does your mom.  Well, you're very naughty.  You guys suck.  And so does your mom.  I'm quite the mother.  The mother shucker.  The mother shucker.  It's friggin' what?  Talk about things.  Talk about things.  Proof syndication.  Talk about things.  Remember to always drink your banana juice.  Back up. 
[00:57:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Joe Rogan's sitting in with us today.  He's going to do like four or five hours with us.  He's a true friend of the program.  And you're playing the Brigada.  Do we have to promote this or...  Uh, yeah.  Uh, yeah.  That's why I'm here, ass.  I wouldn't be here no matter what.  We know that.  I'm just...  Nothing to do.  I would be here.  Yeah, I'm at the Borgada tonight.  And the whole city.  And the whole death squad? 
[00:57:30]  I'm sorry.  The tickets are theborgada.com.  Because Ticketmaster, the Borgada's not working there anymore.  So theborgada.com.  All right.  And the death squad's going to be joining you down there in Atlantic City?  He'll be with us.  Be careful.  Don't heckle.  Don't...  Yes.  We're being heard on some fine radio stations across America.  And of course, we're being heard on the XM.  The XM Nation supporting our move.  And we appreciate that.  We've got to say hi to Pittsburgh.  We weren't on in Pittsburgh before we blew up our careers.  No, this is brand new to us.  And it should be a really, really good market for us. 
[00:58:00]  We'll have to wait and see.  But we've got Megan Slater from K-Rock in Pittsburgh on the line.  Megan, what's up?  Good morning, Opie, Anthony, Jimmy, Joe.  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing pretty good.  We're slowly but surely figuring this whole thing out.  Yeah.  You guys are sounding great.  Everyone's very, very excited on this end.  Everyone?  That's pretty energized.  Everyone?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Because sometimes people from stations say everyone's excited. 
[00:58:30]  And then in the back of their head, they go, that guy hates this idea.  Oh, no, no.  I mean, even the listeners.  You know, DLR was pretty much a debacle here.  So it's good to have a fresh air.  No, we're not a DLR.  He's DLR now.  They don't even say his name.  I know.  DLR like HIV.  Just Roth.  We really came in in a great position.  Yeah.  Once removed is the place to be.  Perfect.  We're not going to lie to anyone.  Once removed is what you want to do.  It's like you don't want to follow a guy killing on stage.  You want to follow the guy who eats it after him. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  There you go.  That's what we're doing.  There you go.  And when we talk about, you know, stations not that happy, let's be honest.  It's Dallas.  There's some people in Dallas that don't like our move.  I don't know about that.  You might be wrong because maybe they're happy to see that the station's going to be back.  You know what I mean?  In a professional way.  You let the professional in you overcome the personal.  I think the people that work behind the scenes in Dallas, very happy.  Yes.  And most of the shows that are on the same station as us in Dallas, very happy. 
[00:59:30]  Who's not happy?  Russ Martin.  Megan Slater, what's going on?  So the buzz is good in Pittsburgh?  Yeah, absolutely.  We'd like a list of the employees at your station and what they've done to demonstrate their excitement.  Because this is just a lot of ass-kissing.  We want to get right down to it.  Are you going to send gifts?  Are we going to send gifts?  Yeah.  Yeah, I would say so.  YSP has already sent a lot of great stuff, and they get a lot of mentions on this program 
[01:00:00]  because they know how to get to our hearts.  What YSP has sent is unfollowable.  There's no way to follow an Aussie lithograph with that sign by Aussie.  Don't try this psychology challenge, Jimmy.  Wait, no, you never know.  You never know.  They may have something that they want to get rid of.  Has anyone been to Pittsburgh in this room, Joe?  Pittsburgh?  Never.  Many times.  I've done it a few times, actually.  Yeah?  Yeah, I've done the improv.  I did the Funny Bones years ago, and I did the improv a couple times since. 
[01:00:30]  I can say I've never visited Pittsburgh.  Well, you've got to come down.  I'm going to have to go now.  Yeah, you're going to have to come and visit.  It's an awesome city.  I think you guys should do really well here.  What's like, what is there to do?  What's like the big thing to do?  Well, we're a huge football town.  You know, we have the city.  Well, everybody knows that, sure.  Pittsburgh's a lot.  I hate to say this because they're going to get mad at Pittsburgh, but it's a lot like  Buffalo.  It's all about football.  Yeah?  Yeah, I lived in Buffalo for three years.  That's all they cared about. 
[01:01:00]  Here's what Pittsburgh, here's what there is to do in Pittsburgh.  Watch the deer hunter and the accused.  Those are your options.  No, we're passionate about all of our sports, you know, Penguins and Pirates, and there's  a lot to do in the city.  We have the All-Star game coming in July.  You've got to love Crosby.  Yeah, Sidney Crosby.  He's a phenom.  He's unbelievable.  All right, Megan.  We're very excited to be on in Pittsburgh.  You guys got to get the WOW stickers going.  I think a city like Pittsburgh is going to love the whole WOW thing.  Absolutely. 
[01:01:30]  I believe that they're on order, so we should be getting them soon and spreading the virus.  Cool.  Tom Chisano just walked in with the brand new WOW stickers.  They're going to go to print, I think, next week.  Excellent.  WOW stands for Whip Them Out Wednesdays, and it also is just a great way to support the program  as well.  Excellent.  All right, Megan.  Thank you so much for calling.  You're welcome, man.  And we look forward to gifts from Pittsburgh by Monday.  Yes.  You got it.  FedEx them.  Or we stop talking about Pittsburgh.  All right, Megan. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Have a good one.  Cool.  That's Megan from K-Rock in Pittsburgh.  She sounds very, very, very cool.  Gene.  When, like, Pittsburgh makes a bet with another city, you know, those stupid sports bets,  what do they bet?  Like, does anyone know?  Because all I know is I-beams.  I think they're just thinking I-beams.  I think they just bet a fat chick.  That's Buffalo.  No, well, Buffalo has the wings.  That's the wings.  So it's wings versus fat chick.  I don't know. 
[01:02:30]  You know, let's at least give it a try, Opie.  Can we at least give it a whirl, take a whack at it?  Look at all the guys in Pittsburgh right now just nodding, going, you're right.  There's a lot of fat.  Yeah, but guys, not your chick.  That's right.  Your chick is really hot.  Your chick's hot.  Yeah.  Really hot.  It's that dish.  You're lucky you got her.  It's that one right there.  Look at her.  Yeah, look to your left.  See?  She's the fat one.  She's listening to that stupid morning zoo station, putting on her makeup, and she's  the fat one.  In her cubicle.  All right.  Jean, someone's screening. 
[01:03:00]  Travis is screening the calls from the dunk booth, and it says, a fan, I think she might  be retarded.  Jean.  Yo.  Hi, Jean.  Hi, Jean.  Hi, Jean.  Yo, Opie.  What about me?  When you used to be on the radio for WNW or something?  Yeah, WNW.  WNW.  Yeah.  What do you do to get thrown off there?  What?  What did you do to get thrown off that station? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, man.  I don't know.  I don't remember anymore.  It was a contest where you had, it was the most creative way to pick up a baby by the  soft spot without using your hand.  Jean.  Jean?  Jean.  Yeah?  Where are you from?  Basking Ridge.  Where?  Basking Ridge.  Basking Ridge.  Oh, Jersey.  Just say the state.  I don't know any places in Jersey. 
[01:04:00]  I try to steer clear of Jersey.  And what seems to be your problem, Jean?  What?  You seem a little slow.  So what is it?  I didn't say, and I have a problem.  No.  Is there something going on, whether maybe you're on medication or something?  No.  Missing a foot?  What is it?  There's obviously something wrong with you.  All of a sudden, you got a Dr. Drew on Loveline.  Yeah.  I know.  What?  I know.  We're trying to be all nice.  What happened?  Did you go all in on the chromosomes and lose? 
[01:04:30]  What'd you do?  I'm hearing something here.  Yeah.  You don't sound normal.  Right.  I don't know.  Did mother drink heavily?  Yeah.  Maybe fetal alcohol syndrome.  Yeah.  I'm sure she did.  Yeah.  All right.  We're done with Jean.  Yeah.  Now all of a sudden, it's not so fun.  No, it's even more fun, actually.  Now you're dealing with a real retard.  Like, oh.  Bummer.  This part of the show has to be much faster paced. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  So we don't have time for you, Jean.  Sorry, Jean.  Thanks for nothing.  We need quick retards.  I feel for.  And we got them.  Big A and Twitchels.  Let's get them in here.  Big A and Twitchels entering the studio for the first time.  It used to be so quick.  Now they got to come from down the hall.  Green rooms and stuff.  Here's Twitchels.  You've never met Twitchels, right, Joe?  No.  Oh, my God.  You're in for a treat.  I think we should start because we do this with all the people that have never met Twitchels.  We got to do a bet right off the bat. 
[01:05:30]  He's really shaken.  Is the death squad in for a bet?  Yeah.  A few bucks a man?  What's the bet?  We'll tell you in a second.  But first, I think I got their mics on.  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time on all the commercial radio stations, it's Big A and Twitchels.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, that's Twitchels.  That's Twitchels.  You must be really nervous today.  New surroundings and everything.  Just a little bit, yeah.  A lot.  Famous studio. 
[01:06:00]  You know.  This is great.  I mean, I walked in here.  It's just exhilarating.  Exhilarating.  It's great.  Many cities.  Look at him twitching.  Wow.  Joe, can you imagine if you were high right now?  I wish I was high right now.  That is rough.  Do you want a lollipop?  Sure.  It's from you.  Absolutely.  All right, dude.  All right, dude.  You've got to love his hat, too.  He's got his handicap hat on.  Isn't that great?  He's like a ringtone.  Well, he does ringtones.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, they're actually done now. 
[01:06:30]  They're out and they're on my site.  They're all done.  I'm really excited.  Can someone take my phone and get me the Twitchels ringtones immediately?  Well, if you go to laughterbyloo.com, they're right on the site now.  I'm not even kidding.  I want the bring as my ring.  Laughterbyloo is your site, right?  Laughterbyloo.com.  That's it.  We've got to get you a Twitchels name.  What are you doing with Laughterbyloo?  No one knows your name is Lou.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Lou.  What's your name?  Give me another reason for that.  All right. 
[01:07:00]  Also, have you ever met Big A, Joe?  You've never met Big A either?  No.  Oh, man.  Big A, say hi to Joe Rogan.  Hi, Joe.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up?  I'm doing well.  Thank you.  Big A is like an independent cab driver.  Yeah.  Not like the real New York City cab.  He's got like the independent kind of cab.  And guess where he's...  Are you still doing that, Big A?  Yes, I am. 
[01:07:30]  Okay.  And he works...  In the Bronx.  In the Bronx.  Wasn't there one year they killed like 46 cab drivers?  Oh, yeah.  What was the record?  One year it was insane.  It's big here.  Because I was living here.  Well, ask Big A.  He's the record holder.  Those...  Those...  Those...  The black town car.  The town cars.  A lot of those guys are found, you know, slumped over the wheel with a bullet in their head.  The cabs here in New York have bulletproof glass now between them.  So a lot of times it's hard to rob a cab.  But these independent guys are always getting whacked. 
[01:08:00]  And Big A is one.  Big A, how many have they killed this year?  I guess a few.  I haven't heard of too many this year.  You see how he has to count as he talks?  That's great.  His fingers are constantly tapping his belly and his leg as he talks because he can't get the words out.  He has to find a rhythm.  And wait till he gets to a word that starts with S-T. 
[01:08:30]  Like star, start, things like that.  It's really difficult.  Well, I think we should start with a bet.  How nervous are you today, Torchel?  Is there real nervous?  That's an understatement, Opie.  It really is.  All right.  Get your wallets out.  All right.  I'm in.  And what are we starting with?  Whatever.  Whatever.  Like five a man?  I got a loose five, so we'll go five.  I bet a buck.  All right.  Here's the bet.  And we like when people play long at home.  It's a great way to.  You're a mush.  Get in the bathroom.  If you're already at work. 
[01:09:00]  You're a mush.  I know it's kind of early.  Maybe you can bet with your coworkers.  Here's the bet.  Look at the death squad.  The death squad is loving Twitchels.  You guys should bring him to Atlantic City.  It is a chore.  Doesn't it look like work to have to just live?  Do they give you medication?  I'm not allowed to smoke weed before I come here.  Why?  What does that do for you?  It calms it down.  Don't give him any lollipops or nothing.  More things for medical marijuana.  Well, no weed for you, sir.  Joe, know what we do?  We make him drink coffee and Red Bull before he shows up. 
[01:09:30]  Aren't they supportive?  Aren't they so supportive?  So if you get high, does it completely calm down?  It actually really mellows it out about, I would say, about 90% to the point where it's gone.  Why wouldn't they legalize pot for this guy?  But you've got to understand, when I come in here, they talk about it so much, and it's embroidered in my mind.  I just, you know, it just drives me nuts.  But, you know, I've got to live with myself.  And you do stand-up, too?  Yeah, I do stand-up comedy, and I'm an actor as well.  I actually applied for Fear Factor a couple years ago.  So, what happened? 
[01:10:00]  Did they call you back?  Well, what happened was, you know, you've got to eat stuff on the show, and he couldn't get it in his mouth.  Here, here.  Here's my bet, and here's my $5.  What is the bet?  What do we have?  All right, here's the deal for the people that have never heard this before.  The faithful listeners are already betting.  Basically, he has a tough time keeping quiet, Joe.  It's almost impossible.  Okay.  So, he concentrated as hard as he can.  But I'm allowed to do facial tics.  Yeah, he's allowed to do facial tics and stuff. 
[01:10:30]  And we have to bet how long he stays silent before he has to make one of those noises.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Any noise.  But trust me, it's a great noise when it finally happens because he's really trying to hold it back.  You know, if you think about itching your face, Joe, for like 10 seconds, you know, eventually you have to feel the urge to do it.  It's almost like that, and it just builds up.  Like an itch.  He's got to scratch it, but he can't.  Wow.  And then, at one point, he just loses it.  And weed calms that down 90%, huh?  Well, I mean, 100%, but it starts 90%, and then eventually, it depends on how much I do. 
[01:11:00]  But I've got to be honest with you.  I don't promote it, but that's the one thing.  Because I used to be on.  You don't promote it?  No, the medicine I used to be on, real medicine, I used to be 300 pounds because it made me gain so much weight.  I peaked at 300 pounds.  So, I'd rather the weed than be fat.  Wow.  Wow.  You want a Red Bull?  Twitch.  Give him a Red Bull.  Yeah.  Give him a Red Bull.  We need to calm him down a little bit.  Do I have a choice?  No, you don't.  It's early.  You've got to wake up a little bit because we need you and Big A doing the news in a little 
[01:11:30]  while.  Red Bull, it gives you brains.  No, it's funny.  Big A's even betting on the Twitchels thing.  So, what are we going with times?  Do you want me to down it?  Yeah, all you have to do is hand Danny $5 and just write down how long you think he'll  stay silent before he has to scream and yell.  He's chugging a Red Bull.  I don't know how long he can.  I mean, this is going to be silly.  His head's going to spin off.  He's actually got a bit of discipline when it comes to these bets.  Yeah, but it's so much work for him.  It's really tough.  What do you do? 
[01:12:00]  Hey, I need that in my replay.  What just happened.  The burp and all that.  I need that.  Remember, Iraq, okay?  All right, so Twitchels is slamming a Red Bull.  All the bets are being written down.  Let's talk to Big A as the bets are coming in.  So, are you nervous today, Big A?  Yes.  I am very nervous and excited to be here on VFM the first time. 
[01:12:30]  So, I'm very nervous, yes.  Yeah, we've been nervous all week because we're trying to get used to our new surroundings.  Do you like the Free FM name?  Isn't that a little weird?  Isn't all FM free?  It's a little weird, to be honest with you.  Some of the stations were on aren't Free FM.  Yeah, they're like K-Rocks and stuff.  Other things, yeah.  It's a little weird.  But, well, Big A, you look great.  How's the girl situation? 
[01:13:00]  We know that last date you were on was with Stalker Patty.  That didn't go very well.  Any other prospects since then?  No, nothing really.  No?  We got to get you some roofies because that's the only way you're ever getting a girl.  Nothing?  No little, like, you pick up a girl in a cab, maybe start a conversation with her?  As long as she's not going to Staten Island? 
[01:13:30]  Nothing.  Nothing.  All right.  God, you are a mess.  And you guys are ready for the Yo Mama thing, right?  Of course, yeah.  Yeah, I heard about that.  What exactly are you going to have us do?  Well, have you watched the show on MTV?  It sucks.  Exactly.  I've got to be honest.  It's horrible.  Well, this is our version of it.  We're going to have you and Big A do the Yo Mama thing.  What is the show?  I've never heard of Yo Mama.  What is it?  You know the old Yo Mama jokes?  Oh, my goodness.  They have a lot of stuff wrapped around that.  What's that guy?  Wilmer from The 70s Show is the host or something? 
[01:14:00]  Joe Rogan is the only one that knows the name of that guy.  Wilder Valderrama.  I only know that because he bought Chuck Norris' house.  And that name really makes you sad.  It does, man.  And what they do is they have this bad set that looks like a back alley kind of thing.  And they have two guys representing their hoods.  And they come out and battle each other in Yo Mama jokes.  And no matter how bad or old or hack they are, their peeps go,  Oh, no, you didn't.  And they're all laughing like an old, you know. 
[01:14:30]  So it's a battle?  Yeah.  One of those drop-offs.  Your mama is so fat.  She was wearing an X jacket.  And they mistook her for a helicopter landing pad.  Like that old.  And they just start screaming.  And they're like, ah, falling down.  I love the set.  The set is great.  It's probably.  What was the comment about the set the other day?  It looks like the set from the Beat It.  Yeah, the whole Beat It video.  The Beat It video or something?  Is it that Bill Burr?  I don't remember now.  Oh, that's funny.  Bill Burr.  It's supposed to look badass, you know. 
[01:15:00]  Like inner city.  Here we go.  This is the beauty of being back on regular radio.  Mike, what's going on?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Good, Mike.  Thanks.  Hey, so pardon the way I talk so slow,  but I just find it a little highly insulting about making fun of stuff, you know.  I'm going to be medicated right now.  I have Tourette.  Yeah.  And I just think it's bullshit.  I think he's lying. 
[01:15:30]  That's terrific.  First of all, don't use foul language on the radio, my friend, my Tourette friend.  And I think you're lying.  Here we go.  Now he's listening to himself.  We don't have time for all that crap.  Remember this, Opie.  Yeah.  Remember this.  If you call the program, which, by the way, the number is 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  Don't listen to yourself on the radio.  We're on delay and stuff, and we don't have time to, you know,  talk you through all this crap.  Sit there and tell you to turn down your radio and not listen to yourself.  Right. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  Are we ready for the bet?  All right.  How much money is in the pot?  The bet, once again, if you want to play along at home with your friends.  How long will Tourette's – how long will Tourette's – how long will Big A –  geez.  How long?  He's got me going.  How long will Twitchell stay quiet?  And I'm the retired one.  Exactly.  How long will Twitchell stay quiet before he has to do one of his outbursts?  Okay.  Danny, how much money in the pot?  We have $70 in the pot.  Ooh.  Look at that.  Big money.  Big money.  Okay.  Very wide range of guesses as well. 
[01:16:30]  Okay.  Who's got the stopwatch for this?  What's the lowest number?  Lowest number for guessing is 25.  And what's the highest?  I have 24.  Highest – do you?  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  You're right.  You're right, sweetheart.  Danny.  And the highest is actually three minutes.  Wow.  That's got to be one of the guys from the death squad.  Yeah, that's got to be a new –  What?  That's you?  Is it really?  Oh, Joe.  Three minutes.  I think you can hang in there.  Oh, Joe.  You can do it, dude. 
[01:17:00]  Three minutes.  You know, just for the record, I like – as the guys know, ONA know, and Jimmy knows,  like when I act and do stand-up, it never bothers me because I'm so focused.  No one cares.  I can always control it.  So, well, I'm just saying that's the technique I do.  Does the audience get disappointed like they expect to see it?  No, not when I'm acting or doing comedy.  But the fact of the matter is they talk about it so much, it's like it brought it into my  mind.  So right now I've got to really – you know, it's harder for me to control it now.  Calm, peaceful water.  Exactly.  Jump.  Still water.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump. 
[01:17:30]  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  How great is that?  That's OCD.  He has to jump.  You say jump.  Yeah, when you say jump.  Yeah, try it.  It's great.  Jump.  It's an OCD thing.  God.  People are weird, man.  Yeah, God loves me.  All right.  Why don't we do this?  Are you ready, Twitchels?  Three minutes, bro.  I got 80 bucks on this.  Let's do it, baby.  All right.  So who's got the stopwatch?  Big A is saying no.  He's saying he can't do it. 
[01:18:00]  Big A, what do you think?  You can do it, man.  I don't think he can last three minutes.  No, he's not lasting three minutes.  You can do it, dude.  There's not even a chance, Joe.  I'll do a little side bet with you if you want.  You can do it, man.  All right, E-Rock.  I'm going to talk you out of it.  I'll try.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Hello.  Hi, sweetie.  I didn't even know.  Oh, there you are.  There you are.  Bill Burr has joined the mess that is the Opie and Anthony program today.  Hello, Bill.  I said the 58 people in studio.  I know.  This is a party. 
[01:18:30]  There's at least 20 or 30.  I've never been in a radio studio with this many people in.  It's crazy.  When we first started, there was like 100, so it's getting less and less every day.  Hopefully by next week, it'll just be the crew.  Yeah.  There's a lot of strange faces around here still.  I kind of like this on Fridays, though.  All right, Anthony.  Are we ready?  Yep.  All right.  So here's the bet.  It's Twitchell's.  We see how long he can stay quiet before he has to do one of his outbursts.  $70 in the pot.  Three, two, one, go. 
[01:19:00]  He's jumping.  He's jumping up and down.  He's going to train.  Oh.  Is that fair?  Is he allowed to taunt him like that?  Yeah, his face takes around.  Jimmy's taunting him.  Yeah.  He's jumping.  His face takes around.  Three minutes is very possible.  His face is going nuts.  I smell money.  I smell money.  I, I, yeah.  Oh, yeah, baby.  What if this cures him?  It's not.  No.  Something pops in the back of his head. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, all he needed was three minutes.  All right, wait.  He's struggling.  No, no.  He's fine.  He's fine.  He's not going to tap out.  Dude, in a few seconds, you're going to hear a sound that sounds like one of those German  chicken videos.  Two minutes.  How long?  Two minutes and 10 seconds, he's going to do it.  Here we go.  Here we go.  No, he's fine, man.  He's hanging in there.  I'm winning this.  No, he's getting close.  I smell it.  He's getting close.  I smell victory.  Oh, he's trying.  Calm down.  Oh, he needs focus.  Everybody calm down.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  His headphones just flew off his head. 
[01:20:00]  He's not.  This guy's an animal.  This guy's hanging in there.  He's a monster.  He's not in his head like Hulk Hogan.  That's right, baby.  You got it.  You can do this, man.  All of a sudden, I'm back on Fear Factor again.  Hang in there, dude.  Don't quit.  He's a Rogan's lines from Fear Factor.  It is.  He's like a bull rider.  Oh!  Time.  Oh, God.  The German chicken video.  He lasted, it looks like, a minute, 17 seconds.  Damn it! 
[01:20:30]  That's incredible.  Danny, who won the contest?  Well, I think that's a new record for Twitchels.  Yeah.  We're doing this closest to?  Yeah, closest to.  Even if it's over?  Yep.  Yeah, not Price is Right rules.  All right.  Closest to is going to be...  No.  It's going to be Ant with 52 seconds.  Nice.  All right.  Anthony won $70.  That rules.  Yes, Jimmy?  Okay, I thought you had something.  Why don't we take a break? 
[01:21:00]  We got Bill Burr in studio, Joe Rogan in studio.  Joe's playing the Bregada.  Tonight.  Tonight in Atlantic City, if you're in the area.  His stand-up is unbelievable.  I love Joe Rogan's stand-up.  And all right, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, Twitchels and Big A, they do the news for us.  Stay there.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar.  Right, Ramon?  The rich texture.  The full flavor.  So relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks. 
[01:21:30]  No ashtray.  Ramon, open your mouth.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  Presenting Opie and Anthony in-studio visitor guidelines.  Number 37.  Don't fuck the underage.  Drunk guest.  Oh, mister, you're so tall.  Shh.  Not on the air.  Stay tuned for more pearls of wisdom from your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:22:00]  That's one of the greatest songs of all time.  Yeah.  All right.  Opie with a nice big mouthful of food.  I'm chewing, chewing, chewing.  Apparently, you let a little out.  Now you're putting a little out.  No, no, no, no.  What happened was, you know, we tried to eat during the breaks, but Scott Herman's in the 
[01:22:30]  hall, so he's one of our old bosses.  Haven't seen him in four years, so, you know, catching up a little bit.  He was our first boss.  Yeah.  When we first came to New York?  Yeah, when CBS was Infinity Broadcasting.  It was our first boss here.  So, Tom Chiusano brought him down because he wanted to say hi to us, and it's like we're  trying to do a radio show, but then we're catching up out there.  And then in the studio, this studio is so big, and there's at least 20 to 25 people in here  today, and there's like five or six conversations going on.  There's a little conversation over there.  Twitchell's is having his own conversation with himself. 
[01:23:00]  Joe Rogan and the Death Squad are talking over there.  Yeah.  Our security guys are talking amongst themselves.  Bill Burr and Anthony are talking.  A little chat.  It's crazy today.  No one's talking to Big A?  Uh, no.  I talked to Big A.  Big A and I had a wonderful conversation.  I know he's dressed like Bill Nicholson.  I don't know if that...  Is that mic on?  Dammit.  That's a good line, too.  Hello.  You want to try it again? 
[01:23:30]  It's always funny the second time.  I know, exactly.  And, of course, Bill Burr, everyone.  All right, you want to do the news?  Because we're running out of time here.  Yeah.  This show is flying by today.  We have Twitchell's and Big A in studio, and we love when they do the news for us.  Nah.  And the beauty of this for the new listeners, we learned early on that Big A has a problem  with ST words.  When did you learn that, Big A?  Was it like in elementary school or something? 
[01:24:00]  Did you...  Speech therapist?  Yeah.  When did it start?  Yeah.  When did this...  Actually, I don't really know when it began.  No?  Yeah.  You don't know?  Like, was it before you can remember?  All through school, you had this?  The Red Bull's kicking in.  I know it's a visual.  Sorry.  Yeah, Twitchell's is going nuts over there. 
[01:24:30]  You're losing it today.  Yeah.  By the way, someone has a question for Twitchell's before the news.  It's Jamie in Dallas.  Hey, Jamie, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, I was calling to see, does your condition affect your sleeping?  And, I mean, does it cause you any sleep deprivation or...  Very good question.  That is a good question.  I never really knew.  So, actually, when I was younger, I actually...  My parents helped me set up a camera.  That sounds really bad.  In my room to take my sleeping patterns. 
[01:25:00]  And I don't twitch in my sleep, not to my knowledge.  But I did wake up when...  Actually, Big Kev can actually testify to this.  On the way from Boston, my agent Pat was driving Big Kev and me back to Jersey from Boston.  And I fell asleep in the car and I actually woke up and did an arm tick.  And I hit Pat while he was driving the car and Big A was there.  And I didn't realize...  Big A, Big Kev.  And I didn't realize I did.  So, if I do do it in my sleep, I don't realize I'm doing it. 
[01:25:30]  But very rarely.  Well, I'd like confirmation from Big Kev.  It wasn't an arm sweep.  He practically pushed a guy out of the car.  He almost killed us.  Why would you have him in the front seat?  Why would you ever be in the passenger seat?  Well, because...  I don't know.  I feel more comfortable in the front.  I don't drive.  No.  You might be more comfortable in the front, but no one else in the car is comfortable.  I offered him the front seat several times.  Have you ever driven? 
[01:26:00]  You know what?  This is funny.  I actually have my license, but it's still to DMV.  I never picked it up because in the state of New Jersey, there's no law that says people  with Tourette's syndrome can't have a license.  I passed my driver's test and written test, but I want to wait until I feel more...  Just drive when you're high.  Why don't you just get high and drive?  Yeah.  I've never tried that before.  It's the best.  I don't know.  Is it really?  Oh, for sure.  Yeah.  I have to give it a try.  You're so calm and cautious.  If it's Joe Rogan approved, then I'll have to try it.  Oh, for sure.  I'll give it my stamp.  But it's actually still at the DMV.  I never picked up my license, and I passed.  I never picked it up. 
[01:26:30]  The only way I'd let him drive in my car is like Billy Bats on his ride upstate.  What if it was the choice between him and an Asian woman?  All right, Jamie.  Thanks for listening in Dallas there.  Let's say hi to John at West Palm Beach.  John, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, hey.  First time listening to the show, and I just wanted to know, like, what's the deal with  you guys and Howard that you don't seem to like them very much, but it seems like you  guys do the same kind of show.  Yeah, it's exactly the same.  Well, sir.  Well, I'm not saying it's exactly the same. 
[01:27:00]  It's not exactly, but...  John, we don't have time for that question today.  Yeah, of course.  You guys suck.  Oh, now that you...  See how Opie got him to get right to the point.  Opie even got all the resources.  Opie, you got him to get right to the point.  How much does this piss you off that we're sitting in his seat broadcasting?  John.  Take that, fella.  They always assume you guys are going to hang up.  That's funny. 
[01:27:30]  They hang up.  No, they hang up.  We don't hang up.  See, the faithful listeners know that we talk about Howard.  We'll explain it all, but we got something...  That is happening in studio today.  That's much more important than talking about Howard.  So don't worry.  We'll tell all the stories.  Oh, these two.  All right.  So Big A and Twitch, they're going to do the news.  This is just horrific on so many levels.  Are you guys ready?  He just downed another Red Bull.  Yeah.  He's got two empty Red Bull cans right there.  That was my third.  That was my third.  Third.  Dude, he's a trooper. 
[01:28:00]  Three.  He's a trooper.  He knows he's not in here for his comedy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Opie, go to hell.  I'm going to take that.  I have Tourelle.  I don't take it laying down.  I don't take it laying down.  I like the sprinkler one.  The folks at home are really missing the visuals, though.  Yeah.  Well, we got the video.  We'll throw some video up on the website.  I guess we're not allowed to mention any of our websites when we're over here. 
[01:28:30]  No.  There's a whole thing going on.  Can you Google our names, at least?  Google our names.  You'll have fun.  All right.  I'm putting your videos up on my site.  All the videos, I'm putting them up on my site of you guys.  All right.  Let's get into the news with Big A and Twitchell.  All right.  It starts with Big A.  Come on, Big A.  By the way, this takes about an hour.  And there's only a page and a half of news stories.  Let's go, Big A.  Good morning, everyone. 
[01:29:00]  I'm Big A.  And I'm Louis Twitchell Santani.  I'm L. Tops.  I'm Tops.  I'm Tops.  For me. 
[01:29:30]  Consumers are stuck with deeply rising gas prices at the pump.  With no sign of...  With no sign of...  With no sign of...  Your head's going to explode. 
[01:30:00]  He's really nervous, man.  He's turning red.  He's going to die.  Table of...  Table of...  Cousation.  Wow.  Chief of...  You might want to do that word again.  I don't think that really came out right.  Here, start with Chief of State.  Yeah, we're talking about the gas prices.  Yeah, we have...  Chief of State, President Bush, has been stomping for his... 
[01:30:30]  Forced...  Death...  Plan...  Of...  Of...  Of...  To...  To...  To...  To...  To...  To...  To...  To...  To...  To...  efficiency  standards  and who  emulate U.S.  gas  support.

[01:33:30]  was nonetheless  determined  to make every  aspect of  jump  of his  movie  where the hell  am I at  now  was nonetheless  determined to make  every aspect of  his movie  as you are  there realistic  as possible  as he possibly  could  Greengrass  has been  involved  with  realistic  recreations  of political  violence  in Northern  Ireland  he directed  the acclaimed  Bloody Sunday  and wrote 
[01:34:00]  the made  for TV  movie  oh my  ama  o m a g h  and those  experiences  and those  experiences  certainly  informed his  approach to  united 93  that I feel  so wrong  he's red  look how red  he is  might as  well  big a

[01:55:30]  send the homeless  bowling  yeah that was  great  we haven't been  able to develop  that one yet  the other one  was  anytime I see  a New Jersey  transit bus  the only thing  I can think of  is the  Voya bus  well that was  another fun time  oh yeah  because I was  arrested in that  incident and I  never think of it  when I see a  New Jersey  transit bus  yeah  Jimmy did time  for this show  it took your  pinch like a  man  you didn't rat  there's nothing  like the first  time you get  wowed  yeah the wow  stickers are on

[01:56:30]  also in studio  helping us out  first time in  the new joint  what do you  think Bill  yeah it looks  like there was  a fire in  here  no kidding  there was  yeah  they insisted  that we started  broadcasting  from here  immediately  it didn't matter  to them that  it wasn't ready  for broadcast  but it's a little  echoey because  they don't have  any acoustic  stuff up  but that's coming  that's coming  this weekend  the other weekend  we're getting  the ceiling  and then the  walls will be  in at some  point next week  alright why don't  we bring Big A  and Twitchels  back in  for the Yo Mama 
[01:57:00]  finale  yeah  let's go over with  Bill Burr  you're playing  Philly in the  near future  a couple weeks  at least right  yeah Electric Factory  on the 19th of May  with Greg Giraldo  Greg Giraldo  that's right  Comedy Central  Live  and Mike  Barbiglia  so many comics  there's Big A  and Twitchels  again  really fast  Joe Rogan  what's going on  with the fight  with Wesley Snipes  he backed out  a lot of feedback  on that  I don't know  it was his idea  and then apparently 
[01:57:30]  somewhere along the line  he changed his mind  that got a lot of hype  yeah well it was exciting  I was looking forward to it  it was going crazy  you know  it wasn't my idea  it was his idea  he wanted to fight  Jean-Claude Van Damme  and do some sort of  a celebrity fight  and you know  do something to rejuvenate  his action career  and they said no  they said you're going  to have to fight  someone who's more  currently popular  would you be willing  to fight Joe Rogan  he said yes  and they called me  and I said alright  I'll do it  so I started training  immediately  like seriously  I was every day 
[01:58:00]  and then two months in  I was like what's going on  and then finally  he backed out of it  so I don't know  what was his excuse  did he give an excuse  no I never talked to him  never spoke to him  I have no problem  people are like  what's your problem  I don't have any problem  with him  I don't even know  just a professional thing  to me it looked like  it would be fun  looks like  I think  I think I could choke  and what do you think  you think it would have been  30 seconds  30 seconds  about 30  I got Wesley  I'm going to get a hold of him  he's like movie tough  but I don't know  I don't know about  I'll rape him  I'll rape him  I'll grab a hold of him 
[01:58:30]  like a little girl  and just hold him down  there's nothing he can do about it  have you guys run into each other  any sort of awards thing  and maybe stare at each other  in tuxedo  I'll find him in an award show  what award is Wesley Snipes  being nominated for  come on man  those blades  the best bitch slap  yeah  the third one  because they didn't give him  enough stuff  best abs in a B movie  I was a fan of that guy  I mean I still have him  I have no problem with him  it's not a  but it was just like  I was just  you know  I mean if it's like  you know  Hulk Hogan wanted to fight  I'd be like  oh no 
[01:59:00]  that guy's big  Wesley Snipes  I think I can get out of that  with very little damage  like yeah  there are people  that are tough in the movies  he's one of them  you know  especially if you brought  his sword  with him  for blade or something  the whole experience  of fighting  if you've never had  he's never had a fight before  if you've never actually  been in a row  there's no way  you can handle that pressure  the first time  yeah  there's no way  there's no way  he's gonna be  oh go ahead  and on top of that  he doesn't have  Joe coming at him  out of a corner  that would just be like  plus he has a lot to lose  because he's actually  done like those  action movies 
[01:59:30]  yeah where he beats up  50 guys  well it also  he doesn't know  how to fight on the ground  that's everything  if you don't know  how to fight on the ground  you're a dead man  I always heard that  about Wesley  he's not good on his back  I gotta break in  because we got 10 minutes  left in this part of the show  and then we move over  to our other studio  on XM Satellite Radio  we got Big A and Twitch  in the studio  and we're gonna do  the Yo Mama thing  yeah this is  Jesus Christ  you've seen the awfulness  of it on MTV  this show 
[02:00:00]  honestly sucks  it's horrible  our show  no no no no  your mama  wow  you're a part of it pal  maybe a little better  attitude would be  annoying  and you notice  they put it in like  the 1-2am time slot  it's a horrible show  your mama  Will Devaldorama  bought Chuck Norris'  house though  I don't think Twitchell's  is happy about that  or he's pleased as punch  alright how are we  gonna do this  just let them go at it  how do they do it  on the show  they're just kinda like 
[02:00:30]  there's like a referee guy  that's all I know  you're representing  where  Bill you want a referee  cause you got the wireless  just get over there  and I don't know  make it look good  Twitchell's is representing  what neighborhood  what hood  I'll say Philly  Philly  Philly  and Big A  you're representing  it's gotta be like  Illadelphia  yeah yeah  Illadelphia  is that Illadelphia  cause the Phillies  we got Big A over here  alright here's Bill  yeah yeah  where you holding it down  in the Bronx

[02:13:30]  Unless you're learning lies  Is anybody else's microphone operating?  No  Ops isn't  Ant isn't either  The Orpheum  May 12th  Me and Dave Attell  Go to Ticketmaster.com  If you happen to live in the Boston area  That's the Orpheum  May 12th  And we're preparing  To walk over to  The XM Studios  And Big Tez  Is carrying my  Aussie lithograph  And if he drops it  I'm going to set him on fire  I'm very worried 
[02:14:00]  That he's going to drop  My Aussie thing  And I'm really hoping  He doesn't  And we're talking  To a few  Miscreant  Creepy fans  Who are kind of lurking out  And Bill's trying to have  A man to man conversation  With the only guy  That pinned to Gracie  Not going well  Alright  Alright I guess  I'm the only one on  So I'm not too sure  What to say  I'm all alone  Orpheum  May 12th  If you happen to be in Boston  That really is all that matters  Or if you happen to live  Maybe down in Philadelphia  Or Jersey  You can go see Joe Rogan 
[02:14:30]  Tonight at the Borgata  Then again  Bill Burr will be appearing  Somewhere  At the Electric Factory  I don't know when  It's in May  With Greg Giroldo  Am I the only one talking?  No voltage is an XL channel  Which may include  Explicit language  Channel blocking  Is available by calling  1-800-XM-RADIO  Or XM-CANADA  At 877-438-9677  They just turned it off  Now it's on  This is going well  These walkovers  Are really going to be a hit  With the fucking listeners  You know what 
[02:15:00]  I'm impressed  That it was working  For two days  Of course it wouldn't work  On the third  No I wouldn't  Why would it work  Three days in a row  Bill do you  Is that not a classic  ONA fan  Yeah  Bill's pointing out  An ONA fan  Who's backing up  He's wearing awful  Knee length  Jeans shorts  From 1988  1988 fat girl shorts  With a pair of white socks  Awful black shoes  And a Batman  T-shirt  And his head  His fucking head and face  Belong on the  Hills have eyes  I have a feeling

[02:16:00]  How hard it is  Just to talk into a mic  While you're walking  And be interesting  Yeah I want to  Apologize for that  Yo mama idea  With Twitchell and Big A  We should have probably  Rehearsed it beforehand  I think what we needed  To do was actually  Write them some jokes  I drove up here  From Philly for that  Thinking it was  Going to be hilarious  Wasn't it your idea?  Oh yes I said  It was terrible  Bill Burr's idea everyone  I just apologized for it  But I want to make sure  Everyone knows  It was Bill Burr's idea  We should have rehearsed it  It wasn't a bad idea  In theory it was okay 
[02:16:30]  We didn't have an ONA  Rehearsal on Tuesday  And if that bit killed  You wouldn't have got the credit  We would have been like  Ah somebody came up  With this for us  What are we waiting  For a light or something?  I'm like fucking  Pablo Guzman now  Just holding this  While people with something  To say talk  John Montone  Okay  Alright time to cross the street  Big Kev has my Aussie picture  In front of him  And all I think  Is him tripping  And fucking skinning  His dumb knees  And falling face first  Out of my Aussie lithograph  Sir don't touch the Aussie picture  Alright careful curb  I got it

[02:18:30]  Ask this fine young lady  Where she's going with the suitcase  She's running away from us  Okay  That guy's leg was the physical version  Of the bit I just pitched  I don't think the bit was that bad actually Bill  To be honest with you  It was hard because the news was first  And then they just talked  You know what bit stinks  Is the walking from one studio  To the other bit  Because we only have one out of three mics 
[02:19:00]  Working today  Ah why bother checking on the mics  Before we do the walk over  That would be  That would be smart  Sorry you dropped something  Alright we're walking into the building  To continue  The show on XM  Satellite  Radio  We got Joe Rogan  He'll be in studio  In a couple seconds here  Also the Death Squad  Big A and Twitchels  We learned something about  Big  Actually Twitchels  He has a new thing  That we got to exploit  We'll get into that 
[02:19:30]  In a few minutes here  But the mic's crapping out  So we'll see you upstairs  In a second  This mic crapping out  Who the fuck am I  What the fuck is this shit  Disgusting  Sexual  Parents say it is not for kids  Pornography in the workplace  We played on TV screens  Drawings  They ran south  And took off with a family car  People making nasty comments  About women  Viruses  Spreading in our area  Find out where  Racial language  And racist attacks  Push the button 
[02:20:00]  I'm a black ninja  Fuck face  Alright we remember  Shut up  We smoke pot  With Snoop Doggy Dog  On a daily basis  You're talking out your ass  Just give me some action today  I'm gonna crap myself  Oh what a log  You're gonna have  Holy shit  Holy shit  Yahoo  The Obie and Anthony show  Holy shit  Yahoo  Envy  With Obie  I have psychosis  Anthony  I'm a xenophobic asshole

[02:21:00]  Let's get the show  On the road  I don't hear me  Oh there I am  Hi welcome  To the Obie and Anthony show 
[02:21:30]  Fuck yeah  That's what I did the other day  You just gotta get it out  Like twinches man  This is the real shit  Wow  I'll tell you one thing  If that walkover  Doesn't make the whole  CBS deal worth it  Nothing will  The laughs people have on that  It's so bizarre  You go from one studio  To another  Yeah  It's so strange  It's so unnecessary  But the walkover  Is a great  Why weren't the mics  Working today  I don't know  We gotta explain that  Homeless guy's leg  How come they make you guys 
[02:22:00]  Walk from one studio  To the other  What is this about  It's a  Yeah  It's about  My dick is bigger  Than your dick  Oh  Okay  The two companies  It's between the two companies  Because it's really  Really silly  In the end  And there isn't much trust  That we can be here  And not be dirty  Like they want  They want to make sure  They're there  And XM wants us here  Yeah  So we don't spend  All our time over there  We gotta go right to the bathroom  Because on the way over  Twitchell's 
[02:22:30]  Was trying to hold  The crap in  And we're making him  Jump on the elevator  He almost lost his bowels  On the walk over  Uh  Than  Yes  Than  Yes  Oh there you are  I'm sorry  Okay  Is Twitchell's in the bathroom  He's currently groaning  And I don't think  It's just his Tourette's  Make him jump  Just start yelling jump  While he's on the bull  Jump  Can I do shit please 
[02:23:00]  You know how many cops  Have probably kicked the door  In in public restrooms  Thinking he's blowing somebody  Come on  Come on  All right you six  And you know  Nine out of ten times  You can't even put him  In a lad bag  Because he jumps out of it  Jump  Jump  What's going on  Fan  He's just slamming  His feet down  He's just slamming  His feet down  While his butt  Is still on the bull  Yeah 
[02:23:30]  This is a quality  Radio program  We have a shitting man  With Tourette syndrome  Very clever  Must come out  Looking like arthritic fingers  All bent and gnarly logs  When the log is coming out  He keeps jumping  It's just like  Tea bagging into the water  He's letting it steep  If I timed this right  He could really hurt himself  While wiping  Jump  You gotta say jump  A lot of times  In a row there  Jump  Jump  Jump  Jump  Jump  Jump  Jump  Jump  Jump 
[02:24:00]  He may have hurt himself.  Don, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hello.  That's a great conversation.  All right.  What happened with the mics?  Oh, it's Don Wickland.  We don't know.  They weren't working.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, all this must be pre-tested before we...  Absolutely.  Who gave you the microphone?  Steve. 
[02:24:30]  Damn him.  All right.  Well, we'll have to test those out ahead of time for you.  Hey, wait a minute.  Where's Steve?  Yeah, where is that?  Steve.  Steve.  No, no, no, no, no.  Steve, because I think the finger of blame is now pointed squarely at Steve.  Don is blaming you.  You just got the blame.  Oh, shit.  Steve doesn't agree with that.  Hi, Don.  Don't get him angry.  Yeah, Don, we did exactly what we did yesterday, which was test them out here and then bring them over.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, Matthias.  And for some reason, they didn't work.  They didn't work?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Anthony's kicked in right as we got closer to the building, apparently, which I don't really understand.  How bad are they weren't plugged in?  What's that?  Really?  Batteries were no good.  Batteries were fine.  All right.  Oh, well, then.  Well, let's have Mars check them out.  He's checking them out right now.  And then we'll make it all good for Monday, then.  I apologize.  I'm not there to test out the mics for you ahead of time.  You turn it off and on?  Why did you have to go back to Washington on our big week?  Yeah.  All right.  Huh?  Lots of things to finish up here. 
[02:25:30]  Like?  Like?  What's the...  Like paperwork.  Concerning?  The show.  It's being very evasive.  I know.  What's one bit of paperwork that had to be done?  Opie's expense report from Boston from two weeks ago.  That's not important compared to what's going on up here this week.  Oh, everything was under control yesterday.  Everything was great yesterday.  How come they can't just give you a laptop and let you do it on the laptop? 
[02:26:00]  Why do they actually have to put you in a different state to do Opie's expense report?  Yeah.  Oh, I had other stuff to do as well.  Like?  Well, apparently we're going to bring more microphones for you now.  But if you were up here...  But I think if you were up here, I think we would have had a nice walkover between the two studios.  Yeah.  I apologize for coming home.  Awesome. 
[02:26:30]  Is Twitchell's done crapping?  Well, that was frustrating because, you know what?  People are really enjoying the walkover.  And we had a lot of people.  We had the Death Squad and Joe Rogan and Bill Burr.  We could have a lot of fun out there.  Yeah, we needed microphones.  Wish we had a camera for that guy's leg.  That guy's leg was heinous.  Did no one get a photo of that?  That was rotting meat.  Yeah.  He had some kind of gangrene thing going on.  But it smells when he peels it back.  Of course it does.  His leg is pretty much dead already.  Yeah.  That leg is dead on that guy's body.  He had a bandage wrapped around it that God knows when it was put on. 
[02:27:00]  You know, I'm sure he's not changing the dressing and cleaning the wound every day.  No.  I thought you just bugs in it.  Yeah, probably maggots.  Roach eggs.  Rolling around.  Roach eggs.  All right, let's say hi to Angela in New York.  Angela, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  Angela.  This morning, I was sitting on my computer, like every morning, and I listened to you guys.  And I got up, and I went to leave my house.  And I went to grab my, I have my MiFi, and I just bring my MiFi with me. 
[02:27:30]  And when I took my MiFi out of the chart, it was still on, and I realized I was listening  to Free FM, and I thought I was listening to XM.  Ah, see?  You guys are hysterical.  I have both.  I live in New York.  And you were just, you were as great as I usually hear you on XM as you were on Free FM.  Thank you, love.  It was great.  I was hysterical.  I was laughing.  I didn't even realize the difference.  Yeah, we're getting there.  It's getting more comfortable over there.  I think within a week or two, we'll be up to speed.  I was telling a lot of people, or trying to online, until I abandoned Wack Bag for a month 
[02:28:00]  or so, because I can't go to the website, because it's just too much.  And I told them, hey, hey, Missy, hey, Missy, hey, Missy, hey, Missy.  Anthony's talking.  I was speaking.  I was speaking.  Oh, I'm sorry.  My God.  Now, I don't care.  Now, you just ruined what the star of the show wants to say.  So, go ahead.  You talk.  Go ahead.  What were you going to say?  What?  No, because you guys have been so upset with your long-time listeners who didn't switch  over to XM. 
[02:28:30]  So, you're going back to Wack Bag anytime soon, or are you actually going to wait the entire  month?  I'm going to wait.  Cool.  Go ahead.  I pay for three.  I don't know.  I haven't been there in a long time.  I've checked out a few of them.  I'm not even going to bother trying to read.  So, what were you saying?  I'm sorry, Angela.  Go ahead.  Never mind.  Go ahead.  I just, I'm going to keep my hands.  Shut up, would you?  Descriptions.  No one cares.  I think you guys are great.  Do what you have to.  Thank you, Angela.  All right.  Thanks, Angela.  Hi, guys.  I hope you're listening on a MiFi as your car slams into a divider. 
[02:29:00]  I'm just really annoyed those mics didn't work.  It just, it just threw off our whole freaking rhythm.  All right.  We got a voicemail, though.  Some angry person from, what, an XM listener?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm sure there'll be a few.  Listen to this.  Richard is very fucking pissed.  You told me you'd mail it out as soon as you got the other one.  It is three fucking Saturdays.  This weekend will be three fucking Saturdays.  Get me my goddamn camera.  Do you understand me, motherfucker? 
[02:29:30]  I will drive down there and whoop your fucking ass.  See, I was assuming it was someone that was pissed off at what we did, but it's, no, it's  some guy that's, what's this, Steve?  Customer service.  Customer service call.  Oh.  Customer service call.  Customer service call that someone mailed in overnight.  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  I'm ready to hit somebody.  What's the matter, O?  And I got back up with Joe Rogan and the death squad.  Oh.  E-Rock.  Why?  Oh.  E-Rock, stop looking around.  E-Rock.  Oh, no.  How about this?  Oh, no.  Every time you hand some on a wireless mic, put your headphones on so you can see if 
[02:30:00]  it works or not.  Radio 101.  Well, I can't do it if they don't turn it on in there.  Ah, the room.  Oh, shit.  The room.  How do you have the room?  Hold on.  You can't blame the room.  If you had the headphones on, you would know right away that as Steve's talking, no one could  hear them.  I handed in the microphone.  I was waving for them to turn it on.  No one was looking.  So it's my name.  Oh, E-Rock.  Just keep your headphones on.  Steve?  Yeah?  Nothing?  Something?  You're on.  I can't hear you.  It's an angry customer service. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I...  What?  I love when he doesn't have headphones.  Yeah, he just talks through this.  He's talking as we're playing his stupid songs.  My stupid song.  I think it was some kind of electronics company.  Steve, am I not working?  Yes, it is.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  I didn't realize he had his headphones on.  I did.  I still love the awful joke.  Stupid I am. 
[02:31:00]  At least you didn't see him.  I looked right at him.  I turned around and laughed at Anthony, and I assumed that as I turned back that he still  had no headphones on, and that gag would work.  I turned back around.  I'm trying to bust on him, and he has his headphones on.  And so, Eric, you got yelled at for nothing.  Are you kidding?  Are you upset?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I know what Jimmy's getting at.  There was a little tension there.  Because Eric got like a little rope, but Eric's like, well, it would be if they would turn  it on, and I don't know if that was necessary.  That is correct, but he would also realize that the wireless wasn't working anymore if 
[02:31:30]  he had his headphones on.  I think, Iraq, I'm sorry.  Iraq is very sensitive, as we've seen in past shows.  Because I think he might have to go into his box of tender sentiments.  Jimmy, you want to explain this?  Because you, I think you wrote these up for him, right?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I, when I'm sad, I reach into my box of tender sentiments, because it.  Why don't you give us an example of one?  But I'm not sad.  I know you're not.  I know, but this will put you in an even better mood than you're in, if that's at all 
[02:32:00]  possible.  I'm sure the death squad's going to enjoy this.  He's taking it up.  I would like, as a matter of fact, the only fighter to ever pin a Gracie to pick out my  tender sentiment for me.  Well, you didn't pin him.  He tapped him.  He tapped him.  Whatever he did, he still won.  Would you pick this out for me and hand it to me?  Eddie Bravo to the mic.  How about you have him do it?  Maybe Eddie Bravo could read, this is a tender sentiment.  Yeah, this is a professional killer, basically. 
[02:32:30]  Let your heart guide you.  Let your heart guide you.  That is indeed a tender sentiment.  That's beautiful.  All right.  And Jimmy's got a whole box of those.  When he feels a little bad, he shakes them up, pulls one out, and all of a sudden he's  in a great mood.  It just picks you up.  Yeah.  And Iraq just had a little moment, I think, that might have been a little tense or something.  Iraq's got his own box.  Why don't you shake it up and pull one out and feel a little better about yourself?  It sounds like there's a tender sentiment in there. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, we've got to write some new ones.  Here he goes.  He's taking it out.  And Iraq, just like Jimmy's, listen.  What does it say?  My name is Eric, and I hate blacks and Jews.  Okay.  Well, whatever makes you feel better.  That's what picks you up out of your doldrums.  I got a new sound clip for my board. 
[02:33:30]  So this is an angry customer service call to, I guess, a camera store.  Richard is very fucking pissed.  You told me you'd mail it out as soon as you got the other one.  It is three fucking Saturdays.  This weekend will be three fucking Saturdays.  Get me my goddamn camera.  Do you understand me, motherfucker?  I will drive down there and whoop your fucking ass.  You have ripped me off.  You stole money from me.  I do not let people steal money from me, motherfucker. 
[02:34:00]  You get me my goddamn camera here, or I'm going to get you.  Well, I bet that worked well.  I bet they just went right to shipping and said,  Hey, get that fella's camera out.  This guy's a good customer.  He's a good customer.  Plus, the second you start cursing, then they can just hang up.  Sir, you can't use that language.  Yeah, then they're allowed to hang up.  All right, Bill Burns Studio.  James in Kentucky wants to comment about the Yo Mama bit at the end of the first half of the show.  James, what's up?  What's up, Opie? 
[02:34:30]  What's up, Anthony?  Sorry, a little nervous.  First time on O&A.  Had the X on for about four months.  So, anyway.  What inspired you to buy it, now that you're giving out information that nobody gives a shit about?  Yeah, I kind of figured that.  I was smoking pot and decided I needed a little bit more activities.  That's why.  What?  What?  Did I miss something?  Probably.  Anyway.  Hello? 
[02:35:00]  Yes, we're riveted.  Oh, my God.  Do the mics work today?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, yeah.  Unfortunately, the phone works.  Yeah, I kind of figured.  I'm counting the clicks as people are clicking off their units.  The screeching I'm hearing.  Well.  James.  Yes.  You're representing the state of Kentucky.  No, not actually.  I don't represent that state.  Do you realize the more you talk, as you speak, serious stock is going up?  That says a lot for Howard, huh? 
[02:35:30]  Anyway.  By the way, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  You stupid, ignorant, son of a bitch, dumb bastard.  Jesus Christ, I've met some dumb bastards in my time, but you outdo them all.  He belled.  He did.  He belled on his own.  He belled.  He was going to say that he liked the Yo Mama bit, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he liked it.  I was sitting there, like, cringing, like, at least his call's going to be worse than 
[02:36:00]  that bitch.  Let's go to South Carolina.  South Carolina, what's going on today?  Hey, sirs.  How y'all doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I just want to let you know I'm finally getting this whole move to free FM, because  I was pretty pissed when y'all first put out the comments y'all was going to go over  there.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, well, I mean, it makes sense.  You asked us a question.  I have, and then it ends up, it's a pretty good thing, you know?  At least I know now how good it is to have XM, you know, from how censored it is when 
[02:36:30]  y'all are on there for the first three hours of the morning.  All right, thank you.  That's a backhanded compliment.  Yeah, we're done with the phone calls.  We got Pat, Twitchell's agent, on the phone.  Can we get Twitchell's in here?  Where is he?  Still shitting?  No, he's over here.  We'll get back into a groove again in a second here.  Hi, Twitchell's.  How was the crap?  It was great, thanks.  The stomach just feels really queasy still. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Well, that Red Bull probably.  Four.  Four Red Bulls you're up to?  Well, it's what I'm done with.  Total four.  I think that's my record.  The first time I did it on here, I think I only did two, and that psyched me.  This is just, I feel really sick.  Feel sick, huh?  It came out like a SlimFast shake.  Hey, you know your agent Pat, right? 
[02:37:30]  Marketing agent, yeah, yeah.  Marketing agent.  Pat.  Yeah, he doesn't have solid logs, you're right.  There's no way you could have solid logs with all that moving around and jumping and stuff.  And the Red Bull.  And the Red Bull and all that.  I keep forgetting that, I can curse me.  You talking about my shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Moving around and jumping makes your shit loose?  You've got to think it's like breaking it up in there.  Breaking it up in there.  That's what I'm thinking.  I figured he's got an OBI's mic in front of him, so that means everything he says is  the truth.  He's an expert.  Oh, of course.  Are your logs soupy? 
[02:38:00]  Very soupy.  They're not really logs and they're soupy, right?  No.  It's just a nervous evacuation.  That's actually a good point.  All right, Twitchels.  Pat's on the line.  Pat.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Were you listening to Twitchels earlier?  Yeah, absolutely.  He did a fantastic job for us today.  He's amazing.  Yo, what's up, man?  Well, I figured I just wanted to give Lou a little present since the ride up from Boston  back and forth to your remote was like a death trap for me.  I figured I'd give you a little tidbit. 
[02:38:30]  I want to...  So whenever Louis has a bunch of Almond Joys in front of him, he has to eat every single  one of them until he pukes.  Are you kidding?  Nope.  This came from when he was a kid.  He broke into the closet, ate a bunch of them, got sick, and he's absolutely obsessed  with them.  Do you like Almond Joys?  You motherfucker.  Nice.  Are you kidding?  Is that true? 
[02:39:00]  You promised you wouldn't say anything.  Well, you also promised you wouldn't kill us from the ride home from Boston.  I didn't kill us, did I?  I didn't, did I?  Came pretty close.  Why would you have him in the passenger seat?  I really wanted to put him in the trunk, but he wasn't going for that.  Do you like an Almond Joys, Lou?  Yes, I like them.  Who doesn't like Almond Joys?  No one likes Almond.  No one's eaten one since 1978.  Those are good.  They're good, dude.  That's why they make mouths.  They're good, dude.  Bring in the bucket.  Oh, no. 
[02:39:30]  No one has eaten Almond Joys in 20 years.  Hey, who wants an Almond Joys?  Oh, look at the Almond Joys.  How many do you think it'll take to get them to throw up?  Well, we got...  There's bags of them.  We got two bags.  We got two bags and three bags.  Jimmy, I know you would enjoy a nice Almond Joys.  Bill, here you go.  Let me have two, Ope.  I enjoy it.  Anthony, I'll have one of those, Ope.  Joe.  Thank you.  Pass them out to the Death Squad.  There you go.  Almond Joys for the boys.  Almond Joys for everybody.  Almond Joys for the camera dude.  Delicious.  Twitch, would you like one? 
[02:40:00]  No, I don't want one.  They're quite good.  I haven't had Almond Joys in years.  Just have one.  Is he still on the line?  Delicious.  Coconut.  Pat is on the line.  As soon as he has one, it's all over.  Just have one.  I don't want one.  Two, three hundred without even blinking.  I don't want one.  You got one.  Just try one.  You want like 50 of them.  You gotta eat this, bro.  Oh my God.  I don't want one.  I don't want one.  Dude, it's good.  It's really good.  Dude.  Eat it.  Come on.  Twitch, eat it.  Eat it.  Coconut and nuts.  I trusted you. 
[02:40:30]  You fat fucking bastard.  Put it in his mouth.  Put it in his mouth.  Put it in his mouth.  Oh my God.  Come on, dude.  Eat it.  Open your mouth.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Open it now.  This is delicious.  Just shove it in there, dude.  It's on now.  How good is that, man?  It's on now.  Just grab that like a bird grabs a worm, man.  Come on, man.  That's like heroin, isn't it?  I'll do some more over here.  Come on over here, bro.  Look, he's getting the sweats.  Are you enjoying it?  How good does that taste?  How good does that taste?  It tastes really good. 
[02:41:00]  There's plenty.  Oh, wow.  Joe Rogan wants you to have one.  Hey, Joe, can I have another Almond Joy, please?  Sure.  They're delicious.  They are good, aren't they?  There you go.  You know what it is, Jim?  It's something about that coconut.  The coconut, the nuts.  Yeah, just don't want it.  Don't throw it out.  Dude, look at this.  This is delicious.  Oh my God, they're so good.  How many have one in the trash?  He's trying to fight it off.  He threw one in the trash.  Threw one away.  And then ate another one.  E-Rock, why don't you start counting how many of these little, little Almond Joys he eats?  You can have one more.  Jesus, Almond Joy. 
[02:41:30]  I got to tell you.  Yeah, just one more.  They're quite delicious.  Oh my God.  I mean, they got Joy right in the name of me.  Do you want to count?  Sure.  Danny's going to count.  How many are you up to there?  Three, four?  Broken into that closet when you were young, huh?  By the way, Pat's still on the line if you want to.  That really is an awful name, isn't it?  It would be a great bet to see how many Twitchels he can eat before he actually vomits.  What do you think?  How many do you think he can eat?  Almond happiness.  I think he can do at least...  You can't fit it on the rack.  That doesn't make sense.  200?  200?  No.  How many?  These are the bite-sized ones.  How many is he up to?  You can't eat 200 of anything. 
[02:42:00]  These are fun-sized.  He's not going to eat 200.  How many are you up to, Twitchels?  Exactly.  200 of M&Ms.  Four, five?  Damn it.  All right, let's get the money up.  How many are you up to?  I think he can eat 40.  40?  40.  That's nothing.  No way.  He's going to eat more than 40.  Danny, throw me another one of these delicious treats.  I don't think so.  What's better than an almond joy?  I don't think any.  I think, Mike.  Did he get the groove yet?  Did he start pounding them down?  No, he doesn't really care.  He'll eat a few and he'll be done.  It's very interesting.  He's like slowly, you know, getting up to speed, I guess. 
[02:42:30]  I'm trying to explain it.  All he's giving into is addiction.  Thank you, Phil.  That's exactly it.  I can't see any more than 15.  I've had four Red Bulls.  I've had a cup of coffee.  I've had a lot of water.  I just took a big shit.  I don't want any more.  I really...  All right.  I don't want any more.  Are you going to stop eating them then?  They're on the table.  They're there.  They're right there.  They're going to waste away if you want them.  That was delicious, man.  Oh, my God.  You should get to them before the bed.  He's just giving us a read.  And there's another.  He just pushed the mic. 
[02:43:00]  He quickly grabbed them.  Like a frantic...  It's like the way I feed my dog roast beef.  The way he snatches it out of my hand.  That's what it was like.  The hat is off, people.  The hat has come off.  Just have moderation.  Just say no to yourself.  You don't have to eat all those delicious Almond Joys.  Are you a fan of the Mounds?  Mmm, yummy.  I prefer the Almond Joys.  Mounds are okay, but...  Almond Joys, yeah.  That's delicious, Almond Joys.  That's like Milky Way.  Who the hell...  You know?  Twitchels, what do you think?  The Snickers.  You can control this, right?  Yep.  I think this is really embarrassing. 
[02:43:30]  Why?  Because this is like the one thing nobody knew, and now...  Dude, you just took a shit on the air.  You're embarrassed for eating candy.  What?  What?  So watch, you got a sweet tooth.  Just enjoy the Almond flavors.  What's embarrassing about this?  The coconut is delicious.  I used to be 300 pounds over here.  I told you this.  Oh, no.  This is an obsession.  Oh, no.  Was it because of Almond Joys that got you that big?  Just tell yourself no.  All right, yeah, just say no.  You've only eaten, what, six or seven?  Can I leave?  No.  Yeah, I'm right there.  You can leave if you can get past the death squad. 
[02:44:00]  Guys, he usually throws off after he eats them, so he's certainly not going to gain any weight.  Oh, he's still on the line?  Yeah, he's still here.  How many does he eat before he rouse?  Hey, Dan, how about tossing me one of those delicious Almond Joys?  He'll definitely do something bad.  Wait, Jimmy's eating more than...  These are very tasty.  They're very tasty.  I've had four myself.  Did you?  It's amazing.  What is it you like about the Almond Joys so much?  They just make me feel like everything's okay.  I don't know why, but I have to eat them all.  I can't leave any of these delicious treats. 
[02:44:30]  They're nice.  They're delicious.  I cannot leave them uneaten.  Yeah.  Two at a time.  Come on, Twitch.  You chew the coconut.  Danny, how many has he eaten?  Oh, he's licking it.  He's licking it.  He's trying not to eat it.  You lick it and smell it.  Gary Coleman.  How many has he eaten?  Go ahead.  He's had seven right there.  Seven.  But they're starting to...  He's starting to grab at them a little faster.  That's eight.  That's eight.  I just popped up.  Two at a time. 
[02:45:00]  Yum.  All right.  They're going to get weight from me.  He's thrown away.  Oh, yeah.  Feel it, man.  Feel it take you over.  Feel it take you over.  Bill's a hypnotist.  I think he can control this one.  You can control this one, right?  His eyes are rolling into the back of his head.  You can control this, right?  Heroin high.  Sugar rush.  I thought you liked me.  There's 20.  I thought you liked me.  We're giving you candy.  There's 20 unwrapped in front of him.  At least.  Yeah.  You do with people you like.  Holy shit.  Oh, he's got three at a time.  Oh.  Oh, he's gone now. 
[02:45:30]  He's gone.  He's gone now.  He's throwing three at his mouth at a time.  That's when you do that one.  He looks like a chipmunk.  Yeah.  This is nothing for Rogan, though.  He's seen people eat and puke.  I hope I don't have to see that anymore.  I hope that's just done.  Yeah, right?  Enough of the puke-ing.  The problem is I'll keep doing it.  If they keep offering me money, I'll show up.  Yeah.  I'll keep doing it.  Hey, what is the table?  What do you like for that show?  There's no table read.  There's no rehearsal whatsoever.  The table read is me and my trailer getting high as giraffe pussy. 
[02:46:00]  That's the table read.  And then they just bring in the helicopters and people, and you just stand out there.  Sometimes I'm so high that I don't even, like, I can't even read the script.  Like, they give me, like, a script of, like, what the stunt is.  And sometimes I'm so high I start tripping out on words.  Like, I just go, how weird is it we all agree these little symbols mean a certain thing?  I go, man, think about it, man.  Isn't, like, communication kind of like a form of telepathy?  And I'm making noises with my mouth, and you're reading my fucking mind. 
[02:46:30]  That's fucked up.  That's the kind of shit I start thinking.  And then, you know, sometimes I'm in the middle of this whole thing, and the helicopters are  flying overhead, and I'm looking at it, and I'm just like, I can't even fucking believe  this is a job.  This is so bizarre.  So much more fun when I'm high.  Oh, man.  Are you feeling the paper?  I wonder what kind of tree this was.  This used to be a fucking tree.  Who was the first guy that figured out how to make paper out of a fucking tree?  Who was the first guy to eat a lobster? 
[02:47:00]  I did the lobster thing once.  So that was food.  That was a brave soul.  Oh, man.  Twitchels, how many Almond Joys are you up to?  I don't fucking know.  They're good.  Well, Danny knows.  Danny?  They're really good.  He's chewing 12 right now.  Oh.  God, you freak me out with that whole symbols.  And telepathy through just making sounds.  It is.  It is.  Wow, if I was high, that would freak me out for hours. 
[02:47:30]  You're making little mouth noises.  You might as well just be going, I go, I go, I go, I go.  Yeah, you reach.  And that means something.  You reach into your culturally sanctioned dictionary, and you go, okay, I know what he's saying.  Okay, I know what he's thinking.  Let's go to Reno.  Never mind.  He's in Mississippi, actually.  What's up, Reno?  Hey, boys.  Just welcome back.  That's a good one.  I kind of dig the free FM thing.  And, yeah, I just wanted to say hi to Caddy Daddy and Joe and Bill.  Hey.  And I was actually going to give props to Joe.  And, I mean, this is not a shot by no means whatsoever. 
[02:48:00]  But news radio, still love it.  We're still running on syndication.  I wish I could find it somewhere.  Thanks, man.  It was a fun show to do.  You guys did a great job, and some great comics, man.  Yeah, you guys rock.  Thank you, man.  And I'm kissing a little last this morning.  Yes.  That's all right.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you.  Coachels, how are you doing over there?  I'm doing great. 
[02:48:30]  How do they taste?  They taste delicious.  Why are you compelled to just keep eating them?  He's fondling them.  I don't even want to get in a story now.  I'm really distraught.  Give up.  Why are you distraught?  When I was about ten, my mom bought a bunch of these around Halloween time.  And she wouldn't let me have any of them.  And I told her that all I wanted was a few.  And she fucking said no.  And I got mad.  So.  They have to eat all of them.  Show mother. 
[02:49:00]  Shame her.  Shame her?  You know, it's like, I'm sorry.  It's like, God fucked me with Tarassi.  Fucked me with OCD.  I'm not bitter.  Come on.  God fucked me.  I'm not bitter.  We need that on a t-shirt.  God fucked me.  But I'm not bitter.  I'm not bitter.  There's another thing that I have to throw my way.  God, we could sell a lot of those t-shirts.  How do you go into a store where those things are?  Because he hasn't had one when he's in the store.  Yeah.  Don't get me wrong.  I've had plenty before.  But I don't have a whole enforcement of them in front of me at each time. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, there's bags and bags.  You don't have to eat all of them.  Just leave some.  Leave some uneaten and untouched.  So it was the day before Halloween and I found out where she hid them.  And I got them out of the cabinet and I started eating them all.  Now it's like part of my OCD thing.  I try to avoid them, but they're just good.  And it's like...  Sometimes it calms me down.  My tits kind of slow down a little bit.  And it's like...  It's almost like a sick way of healing.  And...  Oh, my God. 
[02:50:00]  I sure...  You're making me one.  Wow.  You've got a whole handful now.  Just very...  It's bringing back memories, I guess.  Very the shame.  Bringing back memories how good it felt back then.  Opening that bag and finding it.  Opening that bag and going, oh, wow.  You'll show her.  Yep.  She can't hide it from you.  Not one.  I wanted just one.  That's all you wanted.  That's all I wanted.  She said no to me.  That fucking bitch.  No, I love my mom.  Fucking bitch.  I love my mom, but what a whore.  What a whore, dude.  Seriously.  Why wouldn't she let you have one?  It was Halloween time.  What'd she think was going to happen?  Yeah, she wanted to save them for the trick-or-treaters. 
[02:50:30]  Other people.  Like, she cared about them more than you?  Yeah, right.  She loved the trick-or-treaters a little more than you.  Exactly.  Hey, Joe, could I have one of...  They're delicious.  One of Mother's Hidden Treasures?  Have one of them.  Oh, my God.  They're delicious.  Oh, God.  I'm going to have one, too.  I'm a choice.  I don't even want any more, but I want more.  It's kind of nutritious, too.  I mean, he's got a nut, nuts are high in protein, coconut in there.  That's like a plant or something.  Oh, yeah, a little chocolate.  Just hold it to your nose and smell it.  As far as candy goes, it's probably the best for you. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Oh, the coconut?  Coconut.  You ever actually touch it to your nose?  You touch the skin like the nose and up and lips get it?  No.  Danny, how many has he eaten?  Sixteen.  And he's got seventeen.  Well, there's seventeen, and eighteen is actually in his hand as well.  God damn, he's a good...  Yeah, they're really good.  Jimmy, how many have you eaten?  Thirty-six.  Yeah, Jimmy's speaking right up with him.  Jimmy.  Jimmy's getting pulled right into this.  This isn't part of the Fat Smash diet, you know.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, when are you starting the Fat Smash diet? 
[02:51:30]  I started today.  This is like a little asterisk.  I had a few Almond Joys.  I looked at Rogan eating one.  I'm like, well, Joe's having one.  Like, you know, two men with the same workout regimen  are going to eat some Almond Joys.  Two men treating themselves  because they've been working out so hard.  Yeah, exactly.  Preparing for fights, you know.  You know, Joe and I just treat ourselves with some candy.  Just a little bit.  So, is your sponsor going to call?  Hmm?  Is your sponsor going to call?  You got like an AA?  I don't have a sponsor. 
[02:52:00]  Fuck him.  Whoa.  Hey, Pat.  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  We want to thank you for letting us know about this.  Oh, don't do that.  Oh, it's absolutely my pleasure.  Thanks, Pat.  Anything else you know about him, let us know on a future show.  Oh, yeah.  I'll be checking in with other little OCD tidbits on my man there.  Jim Warren, you got any references?  New Asians?  And if they're unwrapped, they'll probably eat more.  Why?  They're unwrapped.  Because they're right in front of him, and he knows they'll be wasted.  Oh, they're all unwrapped.  He can't stand to think of them wasted and thrown out and unloved and uneaten.  Exactly.  And I don't blame you.  He's an environmentalist. 
[02:52:30]  He's a Catholic.  Let's say hi to Eric in New Jersey.  You can't waste food.  That's for real.  You can't waste food.  Eric is so good.  Hey, Eric.  What's up?  Listen, I just wanted to ask Twitchels, what does his mother feel like when he's getting  all this abuse by you?  Does she want to just come over to the studio with a shotgun and shoot you guys?  My mother's very supportive.  I love her.  And she...  You called her a whore.  Supports what I do.  Oh.  You did call her a whore.  I was very disappointed.  Do you ever mush those almond joys when you smack them against your face?  I was just angry when I think about it. 
[02:53:00]  That's all I wanted was one.  It's just...  I dwell on it when I keep thinking about it.  Just one.  Just one.  That's all I wanted.  What about your father?  What does your father feel about this abuse?  My dad's a Vietnam vet.  He was sprayed with Agent Orange and Nam.  He's like fucking...  I'm trying to think of a comparison here.  He's like a Gomer Pyle mixed with Steve Urkel.  He's so nice, but he's kind of dull.  I love my dad.  I'm not making fun of him.  But if you met my family, I swear to God, you would understand a lot.  You just wanted one. 
[02:53:30]  This is becoming a real thing, man.  All right, Eric.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch him, Eric.  He just wants one.  Why are you touching him?  Why are you touching him?  Who do you think was more supportive, your dad or your mother?  They're both supportive.  I love my parents.  I really do.  I love my children.  But you ever have feelings like you don't love them?  No.  Never.  If your mom were to let you just have that one, though.  I mean, when I was a kid, I was angry.  You know, when they wouldn't let me have what I wanted.  Could have just had one.  And why are you splitting them in half now?  Why are you asking so many questions?  Oh, he gets a little attitude. 
[02:54:00]  He gets some sugar in.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, why are you?  No offense.  Leave him alone.  No offense.  Let him eat his Almond Joys.  He's kind of changed.  He is changing.  He's changing the sugar.  He is.  He's not twitching.  He's getting a glare.  A glare with a twitch.  I know.  Could you throw me one of those delicious treats?  They're very good.  Jimmy, enough.  We might as well just give him.  Twitchels is generous with his Almond Joys, though.  He's not selfish.  Thank you.  He shares.  We might as well know there's value of sharing.  He's got his dad's three-mile stare right now.  We might as well give Jimmy his own bag at this point. 
[02:54:30]  I just want Nathaniel once in a while.  Wasn't there a guy in San Francisco that killed somebody and blamed it on eating Twinkies?  Yeah.  Yeah, the Twinkie defense.  Did that fly?  I don't think so.  I feel like it did.  You know what's funny?  Initially, that makes sense.  You ever see a bag of Almond Joys come apart like that?  If I ate a whole box of those, I'd do something fucked up.  Hold on.  That spongy shit.  Just swallow salt.  That's got to be the worst thing for you ever.  Those things were never good, either.  No.  My buddy used to always buy them. 
[02:55:00]  My brother used to fight over them.  These things sucked.  Twinkies?  Danny, how many?  23.  That's not that many, though.  There's so many more to eat.  Look at his face.  23?  How many come in a bag?  Well, there's only about another 20 in front of him.  He's going to puke.  No, he's not.  For sure he's going to puke.  No, he won't puke.  He did when he was a little boy, I bet you.  Did you puke when you were a little boy?  When it happened, initially.  I bet you did.  I bet you did, buddy.  Did you puke into your mother's purse?  27.  Just to get her back?  Just wanted one.  Dude. 
[02:55:30]  27 come in a bag.  In one bag?  No, you almost ate a whole bag.  He only wanted one.  That's all he ate when he was a boy.  Just wanted one.  All mother had to do was give him one.  Is that really a harsh request?  Absolutely not.  I don't think it is.  Completely.  And I think you're justified to lash out at her right now.  Yeah.  I can't stress enough.  I love my parents.  But you know what?  If your kid wants a little piece of candy, and always ask him for one, then I think you  should oblige.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Especially when he does that.  Chris has a very good idea.  Chris in North Carolina.  Chris?  Hey, ONA, you guys are awesome. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, I want to see if little Twitchels would bob for Almond Joys on Jimmy Norton's crotch.  Oh.  That's a great idea.  Stupid.  He's already eating Almond Joys.  Why does my cock have to be involved?  I already have nothing in my mouth.  Yeah, give this bit somewhere to go.  We got to build it.  That was Twitchels' best line, and it just slipped right by her.  Yeah.  The mic wasn't on the mic.  What else is new?  Because Eric was fucking around.  Yeah, what was it?  He said, I already have nuts in my mouth. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, sugar.  Let's go to James in Florida.  James?  Hey, I got an idea, man.  Make Twitchels eat Almond Joys, then make him jump until he pukes.  Come on!  Bring Twitchels an abortion!  What?  Why, sir?  You're making that horrible.  That's the funny guy from the tire store.  Funniest guy at Sears.  He's not going to jump.  He's already jumped.  Now he's just eating.  He's not going to jump. 
[02:57:00]  He looks sick.  It has calmed down.  He's mellow.  Mellow him out.  He doesn't jump.  Uh-oh.  He's going to hurl.  That's gag one.  That's gag one.  He just eats.  He just had his first gag.  He looks like Fred Gwynn right now.  He's got a fucking chuck like a broken fire hydrant.  Chew slow.  Is that Fred Gwynn?  Yes, it is.  Chew slow.  He looks like a baseball player right now.  A lot of chew in his mouth.  A lot more to go.  Don't jump.  He's got his Game 7 face on.  No kidding.  Don't jump.  I'm back.  I'm predicting projectile vomit and I'm getting out of the fucking way. 
[02:57:30]  This is like that scene from that movie.  What was that Stephen King movie?  The pie eating contest.  What was that?  Dinner?  Was that what it was?  No.  Stand by me.  Yeah, it was Stand by me.  He's not twitching.  Oh my God.  How many are we up to?  Well, he's got to finish one more because that will be a full bag.  A full bag.  Just like when he was young.  You don't want to waste any of these.  See?  But I had a few so it's not technically a full bag.  Yeah.  You had a few out of my bag though.  Jump.  You don't want to jump.  Never jump while you're eating so many.  Oh wow.  Look at that.  Don't jump. 
[02:58:00]  Just don't even think about jumping.  He's not even jumping.  No, he won't jump.  He's not even talking anymore.  He's not twitching.  He's not twitching.  Twitch, you want to jump?  No, he doesn't want to jump.  He's just enjoying some mom and joys.  Hey, if I was you, maybe you'd feel better if you jump, you know?  Get back to like a normal schedule.  There you are.  Yum, yum, yum.  Yum.  That's it.  French kiss it.  There you go.  Yum.  Yum.  Oh wow, look at that.  It does mellow out his tics though.  I got to be honest.  I used to get really grossed out when people throw up and now it doesn't fade at all.  People throw up right in front of me.  It's just funny now.  Remember when you were in high school and the fat kid used to puke in the hallway and 
[02:58:30]  everybody would throw up?  Yeah.  Smell it.  You're like, not me.  Now you're so desensitized.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Vomit.  You ever watch those Brazilian films where they have fucking Roman showers?  Yeah.  What is that?  They vomit on each other.  What's up with the fart video?  The fart porn?  Have you seen that?  Yeah, they're not real, I don't think.  You don't think so?  No, they're awful.  It's pretty real to me.  Somebody wants to know how many calories he's eaten.  That's a very good question.  It's got to be 50 or 60.  His pancreas is sweating.  He's getting a murderous look on his face. 
[02:59:00]  All right, here we go.  Someone who's good at math here.  Amount per serving, 200 calories.  How many is serving?  Just one?  Serving size, three pieces.  Oh, that's not bad.  So how many have you done?  I can do this math.  About 30?  He's up to 30?  So 10 servings, let's say?  So he's got about 2,000 calories in him.  2,000 calories of almond joys?  That's all right.  I'm telling you, it's coming right across the car.  Not on the console.  Oh, my God.  I've been puked on twice in my life.  Hold on, Eric.  Eric, hold on. 
[02:59:30]  Everyone's by a check.  Once on by my brother and once on a public bus.  He looks...  He has that...  Bad things come in threes.  I'm getting the fuck out of the way.  No, he's okay.  He's just chewing slow.  He's getting a fucking hurl.  Hold on.  Eric has a good idea.  Slow, mellow.  Eric in San Diego.  What's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I was thinking he sounds a little distraught there.  Maybe you should read one of Erock's tender sentiments.  Sure.  No time for tender sentiments, sir.  We're businesses at hand.  Could Twitchell's read one of your tender sentiments?  He's feeling a little bad about himself right now. 
[03:00:00]  Okay.  You know what?  I'll give it to you because you've been putting your fingers in your mouth.  I'll let him read it, okay?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  I won't even look at it.  Dan, hand Lewis his tender sentiment.  No one will ever be quite like you.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  The world can...  And how about rewarding this good boy with an Almond Joy?  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Give this boy his just desserts.  I believe mom would have gave you an Almond Joy.  Mother would have given you at least one for that if she cared.  Yeah.  She really cared.  Saying no.  How do you not want an Almond Joy when you see a bag of them?  Why do they do that to kids?  Every little boy says there is an Almond Joy.  I think you should just try three or four at a time.  I don't think one at a time is getting in there.  Because the mouth is not full, you're saying, Joe.  Yeah.  I mean, you've got to really get the full taste of the experience.  What are we up to?  Yeah.  He's got 29 in his head.  He's got 29.  29?  It was 35 minutes ago. 
[03:01:00]  No, it was.  We were rounding it out for calories.  Oprah's rounding it out for calories.  Yeah, for calories.  So you're almost up to 2,000 calories.  Fill that mouth up with chocolate and just swallow, swallow.  Do you have a saliva buildup yet?  That buildup do you get when you're on a boat?  Yeah, what was that line from?  When you're on a boat.  Fill that mouth up with chocolate.  You're looking at the horizon, trying to concentrate.  I've used it before in some way or another.  You feel that weird, that queasiness washes over you.  Are you fighting it? 
[03:01:30]  Oh, it's going to happen.  Hey, Than, are there any uneaten Almond Joys?  I got five bucks to eat rock pukes first.  There's like a pile of this floating Almond Joy shit in a sea of Red Bull.  And it's just, it's sick, but I want more.  Go ahead.  It'll just melt out.  Your ass is going to be like a broken main pipe.  You have to do this.  If she were to let you have one, just pop it in your mouth.  You don't want it to melt in your hands.  It never would have happened.  Pop it in your mouth.  It's going to look like one of those exploding cigars. 
[03:02:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  He's.  Bang!  Oh, oh shit.  He's not even trying to be over that fucking barrel.  No, he's okay.  You're okay, Louis.  You're not going to puke.  Is that better?  Yeah, that's much better.  No, put it down.  You got to put it down because of the camera.  Put it down, put it down so we can get a good view of it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, a whole fistful.  A whole fistful.  Those are good, Louis.  That's delicious.  They're good, right?  That's wonderful.  Nothing better than an almond joy.  They are delicious.  It just slows your soul, doesn't it? 
[03:02:30]  Come on, Twitch.  Stick them all in there.  Stick them all in.  A mouthful.  Come on.  I double dare you.  A mouthful.  Jimmy, we'll let you lick the wrappers afterwards.  Oh, there you go.  Fill that mouth.  Oh, there it is.  Three to five.  Fill that emptiness.  That's right.  Fill that emptiness, kid.  The naughtiness of opening that bag when you weren't supposed to.  Yes, fill that emptiness.  You found it and you ate them all.  I feel the puke coming on.  I feel the hurl coming, people.  Just swallow a little at a time. 
[03:03:00]  I am an expert on people throwing up.  Fill that stomach with love.  That's right.  Fill that stomach with love.  Oh, God.  I am in a world of shit.  That's the look.  That's the look.  Hi, Joker.  Are we getting pictures of this?  Why aren't you stopping Private Piles Tasty Treats out?  This is my rifle.  This is my gun.  Don't let that go.  Eat it.  There you go.  It almost fell out of your mouth. 
[03:03:30]  Good boy.  Hold it in.  Danny, how many are we up to?  We're looking at 34.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  32 Almond Joy Full Metal Jackets.  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  Okay.  Twitchell's has eaten 38 Almond Joys.  Is Private Twitchell allowed to have Almond Joys in his footlocker?  Don't let it fall out of your mouth.  You've got to swallow it first.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:04:00]  Hurl!  Oh, that is disgusting.  Push it deep to the back of your throat.  Go ahead, Nate.  Twitchell's has to pay for it.  Oh, the glassy eyes.  You know what would keep that in?  A brand new Almond Joy.  I'm going to throw up.  No, a brand new Almond Joy.  Here it comes, baby.  Come on.  Private Twitchell, infantry.  You made it.  You're wasting precious Almond Joys that you would have really enjoyed when you were a  little kid and your mother wouldn't give them to him.  Then you're spitting them out.  He went back.  He spit it out into the trash can, reached into the trash can, filled with trash. 
[03:04:30]  Picked up the Almond Joy mound pile and shoved it right back in his mouth.  Yeah, that's gusted.  That can't stay in the garbage.  It can't.  It's wasted.  What are you going to do with that?  It's wasted.  It's wasted.  That goes against the whole OCD thing, I'm thinking.  Absolutely.  You're right.  I like the waste.  He doesn't like the waste.  He's a good boy.  He doesn't like the waste.  When he was little, he wanted every bit of that Almond Joy, and he got sick.  Mommy wouldn't let him.  Take another one.  And on the bright side of things, this has cured you of that whole jump thing.  Jump.  See?  Nothing.  You better not have any more Almond Joy. 
[03:05:00]  You've had enough.  No more.  He's not jumping.  You say jump, he just stands there.  No more Almond Joys for you.  No more.  You've had enough.  Twitchels, I think you should stop.  I don't think you should have any more Almond Joys.  I'm serious.  I think you should stop.  I'm serious.  I haven't said shit today.  He gets an attitude.  He does get an attitude with you.  Yeah, I mean, the sugar rush.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, something about 4,000 calories.  Yeah.  Gets you a little attitude.  No, man.  Just, uh... 
[03:05:30]  It's all right.  Just one more.  Just one more.  And stop.  Don't waste it.  You already chewed it.  You can't waste it.  If there's a God in heaven, he's going to fucking yak these up right now.  Get me a bucket.  I'm going to throw up.  A Woffer Thin Mint.  That look is pretty damn scary.  Yeah.  Let a boy enjoy his Almond Joys.  So is your mama.  Ooh.  We're going to have to get him on Tyra. 
[03:06:00]  Almond Joys got nuts, man.  Don't.  Tyra could cure this.  He's got one leg up now.  Yeah, he's enjoying these, man.  Get filled up with Almond Joy.  What is he up to, Danny?  Mm-hmm.  37.  37.  No way.  A lot of people would say that is...  Opie.  Enough.  Too much Almond Joy for one little boy, but I don't think it is.  It's just...  Slow.  Slow, Louis. 
[03:06:30]  Slow.  You're kidding, right?  This is going to be like therapy.  He's going to get over this.  Hit record?  Is there a Guinness Book of World Records on Almond Joys?  Did I do it again?  Yes, you did.  I'm the fucking worst.  What'd you say?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Okay.  Tell me later.  Slow, Louis.  Slow.  Oh, it's...  Oh, it's...  Oh, it's...  Don't pull it.  You're wasting it.  It's drooling.  You're wasting it.  Keep it in.  Good point.  Ew.  Wow.  He's scary.  Dude, look at that look. 
[03:07:00]  Why...  He knows.  He knows.  Hello.  He knows.  Private joker.  It's good.  Jimmy knows.  Fuck is good.  I know this.  So good.  I know.  I love it.  I know.  It's hard.  And you know what?  You deserve it, too.  You're weirding me out.  Wow.  I know it was one, man.  Just one.  It's fucking hard to ask.  Whoa.  No.  There you go.  There you go.  Now he's...  Yummy.  Now he's punching them on the table and...  Oh, boy.  I'm still eating them.  That must have...  I would have been so angry. 
[03:07:30]  Like when I was little, if I wanted Halloween candy and there was a whole bag of it, I would  have been so angry.  Curious.  Curious.  The anger I would have found at not being...  Curious.  It would have made me feel angry.  I mean, Twitchell, she loves every other kid in the neighborhood but you?  Right.  Exactly.  Meanwhile, he hasn't had any Tourette's since he's been...  I know.  No.  I think we've cured a lot.  We cured the jumping thing and we cured the whole Tourette's thing.  It's all just a little sugar.  Evidently, the cure to Tourette's is to eat a home and a fucking home and a joys. 
[03:08:00]  Don't touch him, Eric.  Let a boy enjoy his Almond Joy.  Oh, you're wasting it.  Don't waste it.  You're wasting it in the trash can, man.  Somebody.  Dude, those were really good Almond Joys.  And you know, you...  Some of the Almond Joys.  There's so many.  Pulling back into the trash.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, he's pushing them.  All right, this guy's so disgusting.  He's pushing them back into his mouth.  It's coming out of his mouth.  It looks like shit and then he pushes it back into his mouth.  Somebody doesn't want to waste it.  What's wrong with a boy who enjoys his treats without wasting them?  The anger I would have felt at not being able to have any candy. 
[03:08:30]  She was going to give candy to 30 other boys she didn't even know.  And girls.  And girls.  Exactly.  Dirty, filthy girls.  The little sluts.  Yeah.  She hates you.  And my Almond Joys.  Yeah.  And mine.  What do you want to do with them, huh?  With the girls or the Almond Joys?  With the girls.  Do you want to punish them?  He's getting another one.  I bet you wanted to eat all their Almond Joys, didn't you?  Send them home without them.  How come the jump thing isn't working on you now?  How come jump isn't working on you now? 
[03:09:00]  There's nothing that fills you like an Almond Joy.  There's nothing more important.  This is weird.  Stop.  His Tourette's has been cured.  You really are.  It's so bad, I think it's, you're doing a bit, but I know you're not now.  There's a million dumb things going on here.  So where did he eat these Almond Joys when he was a kid?  He locked himself somewhere.  In a closet?  Where'd you hide?  Where'd you hide?  Oh, he just sat down.  That's never good.  Put him in a cabinet.  And you found him, though, right?  You looked and you looked and you found him. 
[03:09:30]  And putting him in the cabinet with that door closed was like her love that was closed off from you.  You had best square your ass away and start shitting me, Tiffany Cuplix, or I will definitely fuck you up.  Is he feeling satisfied?  Not yet.  No, there's more.  He's getting there, though.  He feels better, but there's more.  Why, you little maggot!  You make me want to vomit!  There's more.  Isn't there, Twitchels?  There's always more, Lewis. 
[03:10:00]  Slow.  You want to promote your website?  AlmondJoy.com  Laughter by Lewis.  So much for having Hershey's as a sponsor.  LaughterbyLew.com  AlmondJoy.com  I wish we had that song, AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  Mouths don't.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  Mouths don't.  Wow, he's kind of twitching. 
[03:10:30]  The twitching's starting to come back a little, too.  No, that's all right.  Mouths don't.  Oh, my God.  Real milk chocolate.  Don't puke.  You're going to waste all of it, man.  You'll have to read it.  AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  Mouths don't.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  What's in there?  Heroin?  Nah, he knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He's satisfying an emptiness right now.  Of course he is.  All he wanted was one.  That's very reasonable.  Every boy wants one.  Uh-oh. 
[03:11:00]  Uh-oh.  No, he's reasonable more.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  Mouths don't.  That's all you get.  Why'd you stop it?  Why'd you stop it?  Yeah, why'd you stop it?  Let's start that again.  Do you have that again?  Let's have that again for a second.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  He's smiling.  Sometimes you don't.  AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  Mouths don't.  That's it?  That's all you give me?  Stop it. 
[03:11:30]  That's all you get?  Such a fun song.  AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  How hot is that Pamela Rogers chick?  That chick that fucked that little kid?  Oh, she's fantastic.  Fantastic.  So hot.  He was not slouch either.  You can't play me to one of them.  Uh-oh.  Twitchell started dry heaving toward Eric.  That's the thing about him.  There's a vengeance with his puking. 
[03:12:00]  Yep.  No, he's trying to hold it back.  And he pukes and he goes back in and grabs two more.  Have some more.  Replace it.  Replace it.  I taste the Red Bull.  He missed.  Talk to Bill.  It stinks.  He tastes the Red Bull.  Dude, it's puking.  I taste the Red Bull.  I taste the fucking Red Bull.  I taste the Red Bull.  Oh my God.  It's the almond joint.  It smells like puke and Red Bull at the same time.  Look at Rogan's just hanging out. 
[03:12:30]  Like, I've seen this shit with horse assholes.  This doesn't smell nearly as bad as horse assholes.  This is nothing to you, right?  Yeah, I've seen...  Now we need contestants to eat that and then we got a contest.  Roaches, animal cocks.  I've seen it all.  All that matters now, though, is just keep replacing the almond joint.  That's cool.  You threw up about six of them, so you got to have a couple more just to get back to where you were.  Danny, what's the number up to?  I know he's puked a little out.  Yeah, the count's kind of off.  I don't know.  But how many has he attempted to eat?  Five, seven, seven, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, thirty, twenty.  Forty-one. 
[03:13:00]  Forty-one.  Oh, no way.  Forty-one?  He's still chewing.  Oh.  That's, uh, let's see.  He's a good boy.  Thirty-four.  He's a good boy.  Ah, there's drool coming out of his mouth, his chocolate drool.  Thirty-four hundred calories, about.  He's a good boy and he deserves this little treat.  Oh, no, no, not thirty-four.  When's the last time he did this?  Probably a long time, right?  You treat yourself.  Watch it, watch it.  No, he's okay.  Just swallow it.  Twenty-seven hundred calories, about.  That thick, heavy swallow.  It's thick and it's heavy.  He's trying to fucking puke on people. 
[03:13:30]  No, he's not.  If you're going to puke, can you puke, uh, in front of the camera?  He's keeping it down.  He's not trying to puke.  He's trying to hold it in.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He doesn't want to waste it.  Oh, no.  You're all right, right, Twitchell?  Sure he is.  Here, listen to this.  This will suit.  Oh, no.  The garbage pail.  Get the garbage pail.  God damn it.  That's okay.  That's a lot of throw up over there.  That's okay.  Give him an almond joy already.  He doesn't feel good.  This is, uh, unsanitary work condition.  It certainly is. 
[03:14:00]  I don't think CBS radio would be going for this.  There you go.  No.  These motherfuckers over at X-Men just don't care about your health.  What?  Oh, God.  It does just reek.  It smells good like almond joy candy.  Please hit the garbage pail.  No, he's just enjoying it.  He, like, loses control and the garbage pail falls over.  No, he's trying to hold it in.  His body wretches.  He's trying to hold it in.  He doesn't want to waste it.  Oh.  It looks like a German shepherd had diarrhea over here.  You don't eat a whole bag of that yumminess and try to waste it. 
[03:14:30]  You want to eat and save all of it.  You got to see the logs.  What's the point?  Twitchell.  You got to see the logs on the floor.  Did you want to puke on your mother?  No, he wanted to eat it all up.  No.  Eat it all.  Why waste it on her?  How good were they when you were eating them when you were a kid?  They were delicious, right?  Naughty treat.  Right?  You get me?  Sneak a treat.  You get me?  You get me?  You fucking get me?  I get you, man.  I get you.  Please stop looking at me like that.  What's the sugar do to him?  He's already thrown up and yet he's eaten more. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Because there's many more to be eaten, Joe.  What is he going to do?  Waste them?  Leave them for other boys and girls?  They're his.  He's got to eat what's on the table in front of them.  I can't see him here with a rationalization.  What's the truth?  They're his.  They were bought for him.  There you go.  It's like every little boy's fantasy to have a whole bag of almond joys all for you.  Danny's covering up his nose and mouth with a shirt.  It's kind of good that I have a cold.  Get a picture of the floor. 
[03:15:30]  Give him a napkin, Kev.  Stop being so selfish.  Give the boy a napkin.  I'm sorry for my napkin.  That's okay.  You're just enjoying.  Got to give it up to Child Star.  He's right in there with that camera.  Child Star.  Yeah.  Oh, uh-oh.  Hey!  No.  That is petrifying.  I'm not looking at him.  I can't even look at him anymore.  Hey, somebody move Erock's box of tender segments.  I like Rogan.  He's just sitting there reading the paper like he's just a little breakfast nook. 
[03:16:00]  Rogan seems so much worse.  Waiting to have a saw-cooked egg.  Joe's like, ah.  That's the money shot right there, people.  That's it, buddy.  That was it.  That was it.  Full on.  That was it.  He just picked up an Almond Joy that was covered in puke, and he shoved it in his mouth.  That one made me try. 
[03:16:30]  There you go.  I am not invincible when it comes to throw it up.  And I just cut a ganger.  You can't break me.  He just broke me.  Danny's going to puke.  Oh, Danny should stop it.  I've got to admit, all I smell is Almond Joy.  Who needs Halloween?  Who needs Halloween?  He just broke me.  He just broke me.  No one needs it.  All right, listen.  Look at that Almond Joy on the console being wasted.  Dude, he threw up on one of those Almond Joys and then shoved it back in his mouth.  Who's camera is that?  Joe, look at this shot.  Oh, get it to Steve immediately. 
[03:17:00]  That's got to go on opanthony.com.  Show Rogan that shot.  It's perfect.  You've got to see the shot one of your boys got, man.  One of the death squad got the...  He's got a perfect picture.  No, no, no, look out, look out, look out.  It looks photoshopped.  It looks like there's a gopher jumping into his mouth.  It's great.  It looks like a fucking animal is running into his mouth. 
[03:17:30]  At light speed.  That's the greatest puke picture ever.  It's all over the studio.  All over the console.  Right where Hawk sits.  Hawk is not happy.  Oh, look at Eric.  He looks like a rape victim.  Grab those CDs.  He almost got me.  Do I have some more napkins?  How about some Almond Joys for this boy?  How about some puke-covered Almond Joys?  Oh, man.  There's a few of those over there that are still pukey.  That's all.  He doesn't...  No more.  Just throw them out. 
[03:18:00]  We're done.  Just get rid of those.  Fuck you.  Do I tell you when you're done?  Oh, get rid of us.  Shit.  That's right.  Lewis tells you.  Spider.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat.  Thanks a lot for this little tidbit, by the way.  Oh, my pleasure.  I've been on the line the whole time.  He's been enjoying it.  He's Pat.  I've got to thank you.  He's been on the line for 40 minutes.  Thank you, Pat.  I like these Almond Joys.  It took a while, but at least there was a big payoff.  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't going anywhere until the money shot came.  The gopher. 
[03:18:30]  Hey, can we get that picture up online, Steve?  Where's...  Can someone give that to Steve?  That picture has got to go online immediately.  It's actually...  Do you have a cable?  Yeah, he'll have a cable.  Oh, all right.  Can you stop fucking feeding him those things, man?  I'm getting sick.  Here, Danny.  Brian, get up.  That camera.  Hey, Jason in Virginia Beach.  What's up?  Hey, man.  That is the funniest damn bitch ever, man.  We're just sitting here smoking the fattest joint.  You're smoking a joint?  We're just smoking a joint.  You got KB?  Is it KB?  I'm a joint shit. 
[03:19:00]  Shut the fuck up and listen.  Is it KB?  What's that?  Is it KB?  Are you smoking KB?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  It's definitely time blood.  Joint or blunt?  Did you say blunt or joint?  It's a joint.  Oh, I get the blunt piece.  Yeah, I like blunts, but yeah.  Candy's like his nutty professor medicine.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, look out.  Watch out, Joe.  Joe.  Joe whips her out.  Yeah, we do that. 
[03:19:30]  That is so funny.  It's flying.  Oh, God, no.  That's just spit up, though.  That's not throw up.  Yeah, it's just a little bit.  That photo was throw up.  That was real.  All the liquid.  In case you don't think this is real, go to openanthony.com in a little while.  The picture is now up, by the way, on myspace.com slash Jim Norton.  No, it is not.  And myspace.com slash talking monkey.  Give me it.  Give me it.  Are you going to be at the Borgata?  No, Joseph is.  I'm at the Borgata tonight.  You're going to be at the Borgata. 
[03:20:00]  I'm doing an A tonight.  Tonight.  Joe's doing tonight.  You can have it, yeah.  And you know what?  That's like 40 miles east of the electric factory.  In Philadelphia?  Yeah, on May 19th.  You're going to be down there, right?  Bill Burr will be there.  Bill Burr will be there.  Greg Giraldo.  Who are you working with, Bill?  Greg Giraldo.  Very funny guy as well.  And a guy named Mike Verbeglia.  How's he?  Not so good, huh?  Good guy.  Oh, my God.  Eric in New York, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Listen, what would happen, would his OCD just kick in if you're just full of Almond Joy 
[03:20:30]  and just take it away from him before the big climax?  What would happen?  We got the big climax, but he refuses to stop eating.  Yeah, we think he had an Almond Joy.  Just take it away from him.  See if you'll find Joe Rogan.  He's so sick right now, he can't even stand up.  He's sitting down.  But he's still eating.  Hey, Opie, you want to do the math on how many calories he just puked up?  How many did he eat?  40-something?  Uh-oh.  I'd say close to 50.  Close to 50? 
[03:21:00]  His head's tilting back.  See, he throws up with his head back, so it fills up his mouth, and then it pours out  of his mouth.  He's trying not to throw up.  Yeah, it's really sick.  It smells like chocolate in here.  I love the smell of chocolate.  Bile.  Yeah.  Delicious.  No reason.  I know exactly what that smells like.  How odd.  Of course you're there.  I've seen people.  They serve it.  In a fair fact, their bile, actual animal bile.  Oh.  That's one of the ingredients that we've made people drink.  No, no.  Hit the pail. 
[03:21:30]  Get the pail.  Anywhere but the pail.  Fuck.  That's disrespectful.  That's disrespectful.  You're puking right on my feet.  He's got to be nuts that he's puking so close to the dead squad.  Insane.  I'm sorry, Joe.  Yeah, you know what that's like?  That's like suicide by cop.  Yeah.  Just puke on a couple of UFC guys.  I'm sorry.  You're nuts.  You didn't get me.  These guys will snap your neck.  Don't hurt me.  Yeah.  I don't think either one of them would grab him.  Look at how there's all that Red Bull in the puke. 
[03:22:00]  You can see it in the puke.  I can't see the Red Bull.  Hey, Kev.  Hey, Kev, give him a napkin.  Stop thinking about yourself.  Should we take a break?  I'm tapping.  Yeah, let's take a break.  I got to take a piss and get out of this fucking room.  Yeah, we're going to take a break and continue.  You can continue eating if you have to, Twitchels, but we have to.  I know.  I have that dry, pasty feeling in my mouth.  Like, want some mule juice?  Okay.  Meet you in the bathroom.  All right.  We're going to step aside for a little while. 
[03:22:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was.  She's a woman, you know what I mean.  You better listen out, listen to me.  She's going to set you free. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The ONA virus is alive and well.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, well.  I know.  I'm a little.  Yeah, there's other viruses that are alive and well.  I know.  I'm a little delirious.  Quick update.  Twichels is dead.  We forced him out of the studio because the cleaning crew had to come in.  There's puke all over the place.  We're getting video and pictures up on the website in the very near future. 
[03:23:30]  They're working on it right now.  OpieandAnthony.com.  Jimmy and I were discussing this outside the studio.  I'll be honest.  I go, Jimmy, you think some of that was acting?  You think some of that was faking?  Because the look he was given seemed a little calculated.  And you're convinced no way.  Absolutely not.  Because I'll tell you why.  What was happening is he was going, that's like a drug.  And what he was getting, that was behaving like somebody who's like, who's getting high  or who's drunk.  You don't, you wouldn't overeat and calculate behaving that way.  And even in the bathroom, he's like, they're not mad at me, are they? 
[03:24:00]  It was like a guy who's high.  He's all fucked up.  You understand?  That's not about it, please.  That's really good.  But on Brightside, he wouldn't jump when you said jump, and he wasn't doing the spastic  stuff.  Yeah, we found the cure to Tourette's.  That's it.  We found it.  Whole bag of Almond Joy miniature.  But will they give us recognition for that?  Nope.  No, they won't.  Rogan had line of the fucking day where that picture, wait until you see it online, it  looks like a gopher jumping into his mouth.  It really does.  Because it's all blurry.  It's blurry. 
[03:24:30]  It looks round and huge.  It looks fuzzy and blurry like it's motion blur.  And it looks like a solid.  It doesn't look like a liquid.  No.  That was the perfect shot of him vomiting chocolate of anybody.  I defy you to find a better chocolate vomit photo.  Brian Reichel, cameraman extraordinaire.  Unbelievable.  I remember the death squad.  That's going to be on one of those shit sites.  Of course.  Of course it is, yeah.  Somebody's going to whack off to that picture.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  And they get mad later.  It's only chocolate.  This fucking site is bogus. 
[03:25:00]  Fake.  Fake site.  I don't think there's one picture on the web that hasn't been jerked off to.  Like, it doesn't matter what it is.  A potted plant.  That's the rule.  Oh, motherfucker.  The other internet rule is if there's a photo of you on the internet somewhere, someone  has photoshopped a dick in your mouth.  For sure.  For sure.  Yeah.  For sure.  Yeah.  You're in denial.  Let's say hi to Chad in New York.  Chad.  What's going on, fellas?  What's up, Chad?  Hey, Chad.  Not much.  That's what I say.  Your show's fucking awesome, dude.  You guys are hilarious.  Twittles is a sick son of a bitch. 
[03:25:30]  You should have seen when he ate them when the puke was on him.  That almost made me throw up.  You know when you take, like, a tater tot and you get the last bit of ketchup?  That's what he was doing with the almond joys and the puke.  It was like scraping a tater tot in baked beans.  I think the people at Peter Paul ought to be informed that maybe that should be something  they should look into.  Yeah.  The vomit-covered almond joy. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, what did Bill say before that almost...  What?  Why'd they call you a bit wrecker?  I just...  He's ruined a few bits.  No, but what did you say today?  I didn't hear anything that would have...  I'm afraid it opened my mouth.  Does it matter now or no?  A lot of people were wondering where the fart noises are coming from.  For the past two days...  We didn't want to explain where the fart noises were coming from, but Bill Burr was so fascinated  with what I was doing, he had to ask on the air.  No, I thought, was that like some sort of Norton fucking sex toy? 
[03:26:30]  Was that supposed to feel like a vagina, like you stick your dick in the thing?  I didn't know what it was.  Bill, I don't use sex toys.  Actually, I'm very organic.  Yeah.  I rarely even use lube.  Eros.  You don't have a dry.  Yeah, I do too, but it desensitizes my dick.  Dry.  I dry skin.  Like a man.  Like John Wayne.  That's how John Wayne do.  You don't do the slide.  No, I do the grip.  If you don't have any lube, you don't do the slide.  Do the grip grip.  It's all about grip.  Three fingers, too.  Not even a full hand.  Three?  Three fingers.  It's abusive, too, when you jerk off like that.  You've got to use Eros.  There's a black bottle called Eros.  You know something? 
[03:27:00]  You could come a lot quicker with the grip than you can with the slide.  I don't know, man.  When I have the fucking grip, I'll jerk off soft.  My dick will be soft.  If I have the grip and lotion, I will blast.  I will blast.  You know what's funny?  You guys are really destroying the image that people have of people in the entertainment industry.  They get pussy all the time.  When I jerk off, my technique that I like to use.  I jerked off the other day.  When my girlfriend was lying in bed asleep, I jerked off right next to her. 
[03:27:30]  And I tried to do it really calm and quiet because I was afraid.  We were on vacation together and I was going to wake her up and fuck her.  But I was like, you know what?  What?  What's the point?  I'm like, I just want to think about another chick.  So I was just slowly trying to jerk off while she was lying in bed right next to me.  And then she came and I went to sleep.  I was worried at one point in time, her breathing changed a little bit.  I'm like, is she awake?  What did you do with it?  Did that add to the excitement? 
[03:28:00]  I have a rule.  I have a safe zone in my body for some reason where it's okay for my loads to land.  And that is between my solar plexus and my belly button from here to here.  For whatever reason, anywhere else, I don't give a fuck.  If I came in my face, I would not be able to go back to sleep.  But if I came right here, I'm like, yeah, fuck it.  That's a good place.  Wake up with potato flakes on you.  I don't care.  She wakes up.  She just covers up.  She's like, why are you reading Boy's Life?  I don't know.  I know these lads are so athletic.  Where's Honcho, by the way?  It's hysterical. 
[03:28:30]  Maybe threw it out.  I didn't want it.  Don't you?  I mean, don't you have a safe zone?  Dude.  Everybody has a safe zone where your loads land there.  You're like, ah, what the fuck?  It's no big deal.  No, I would always need like some kind of covering.  Really?  Yeah.  The sheets work.  Fuck it.  Or a towel that was going to go into laundry or something.  When I was a teenager, I discovered masturbation.  I don't know why I would do this.  But what I would do is I would come home from school.  I would jerk off.  Just let it pull in my belly button.  And I would like fall asleep. 
[03:29:00]  And then wake up.  Like I would wipe it off with the sheet.  I would wipe it off with the sheet.  And then just move the sheet over to the left.  So I had a whole piece of my sheet that was like all dried loads.  And my grandmother was helping me change at one time.  And she went, what happened?  And I'm like, I spilled Pepsi.  What the fuck is in your Pepsi?  I know.  Just spilled it out of your crack.  Hey, there's a couple of really good phone calls coming in here.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing, sweet tits?  Hey.  I have to comment on what I saw during the break on PalTalk. 
[03:29:30]  Look, you know, intern Bill is fearless.  Because you've got one guy cleaning up the puke with these latex gloves on.  And Bill is just like diving right in there like a team player.  Just cleaning it up with his hands.  You know, he really is like afraid of nothing.  Bill would be the perfect Marine if he wasn't a fidget.  PalTalk is fucking crazy.  Isn't it great?  There's some...  Yeah, the show just continues during the breaks.  They just keep watching during the break.  Bill's actually scrubbing the console of his beard.  He's an animal.  Bill, are you having a problem cleaning up the puke?  Nah, just it's in the carpet. 
[03:30:00]  And before it hardened, we could put a lot of resolve in it.  So I'm laying that sit.  Twitchels puked everywhere, man.  Yeah, it got everywhere.  It got everywhere.  It got on the computer keyboard.  We had to throw away, what, the pen holder?  Yeah, it got a cup.  It got a pen holder cup, and then it might have worked its way, which is going to be really bad.  It did.  Underneath the gap in the console.  That has to be flushed out or something.  I was able to go like this.  Where's the Purell?  He's got it right next to him.  Oh, yeah.  I was Purelling because I touched the doorknob, and I don't know what the hell is going on. 
[03:30:30]  You got to throw out that keyboard, man.  No, it's not.  Eric used it.  Eric's fine.  He got some on his hand.  Are the pictures up on opianthony.com yet?  They're coming.  The fear factor for me is just walking to my car after the show.  I'm just – I'm disgusted by everything.  You just have a problem with germs?  It's not germs.  People are – a misconception that I – it's disgusting things.  Oh, okay.  Like germs, I don't care.  It's not – I don't care about germs, but disgusting things. 
[03:31:00]  Like that's my fear factor.  It was so putrid to me, but I was compelled to watch.  Like when they're chowing down on those intestines and stuff, I can't see how they do it.  Mouth full of bugs transfer into someone else's mouth.  I lose it.  I just be like, I can't watch it.  You should have been there and smelled it.  The smell is the worst.  Really?  Oh, some of the things are so fucking bad.  What kind of bugs?  Do you do anything with roaches?  Yeah, I ate a roach once.  I ate a Madagascar hissing cockroach.  Oh, it was the size of a fucking cell phone.  Nasty.  They make noise.  The size of a cell phone. 
[03:31:30]  It was.  It was huge.  It was disgusting.  But they really don't taste that bad.  No.  It's kind of gross, but it's not that bad.  It's kind of slimy inside, though, right?  Yeah, but so is an almond joint.  What would it taste like?  You know?  Think about it.  You know, not that bad.  Yeah.  Like a gooey almond.  Let's go to Sherry before we lose her.  She's from Atlanta.  She's got an interesting jerk-off story.  Sherry, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  I just called to tell you that I got a DUI a couple years ago, and they were doing like  an expose in the news about this slack county that I got. 
[03:32:00]  You know, they weren't making us work that much, but I'm on the side of the road wearing  an orange vest.  It looks like crap, and I'm picking up garbage, and they put a picture of me in the paper where  I was like holding a bag of garbage.  It looked like crap, and I got a message from a letter from the prison saying, we loved your  picture in the newspaper, and we've been jerking off to you for weeks and passing your picture  around.  I was holding a bag of trash in front of a graveyard.  Are you hot?  Yeah, are you hot? 
[03:32:30]  She's prison hot.  I might say, but I was wearing a coat with a vest on top of it.  With a big orange vest.  Hey, can you send us a copy of the picture?  I'm sure you still have the article.  To prisoners, that's totally nude, by the way.  You were bending over?  I was actually holding the trash up in the air, looking at it like, ew.  Could you send it to us, please?  I don't know.  Absolutely, I will.  Thank you.  Yeah, you jerk off to anything if you're not.  Yeah, fuck it.  The warden apparently pretty much reamed this guy, because I called the prison, and I was  like, please get my freaking picture out of the jail. 
[03:33:00]  And they told me we took care of him.  So I don't know what they did to this guy, but I don't know.  Well, you can't be surprised they're jerking off to your picture if you look sloppy.  They resort to fucking each other.  Right.  That's true.  You're a supermodel to them.  That's true.  God, that made my day.  Anyway, take care, guys.  Yeah, anything was good material, especially back when you were a kid.  I mean, catalogs.  Sure.  Things, you know, no internet when I was growing up. 
[03:33:30]  So it was my mother's Cosmo.  My mother used to subscribe to Cosmo.  And there was a section, one page in the back every month, that was called Cosmo Tells  All.  And for some reason, they needed a nude picture of a girl on that thing.  So every month, I knew there was a new nudie.  What about the breast?  Just like a fucking monkey.  What about the breast cream ads?  I don't remember many of those in Cosmo.  I was in the back of some of those magazines.  The thing with me, though, was I really needed nudity.  I couldn't, like, bra and panty ads were okay. 
[03:34:00]  They'd work, but nudity to me, it was over, Johnny.  As a kid, you'd go through the woods sometimes and find someone's stash.  Like, you'd be walking through the woods on fall day and kick them high on the leaves.  And you'd see, like, the hardcore porn.  Or even that shit where, like, they were showing blowjobs and stuff.  Right, right.  Where the pages were thick.  Yeah.  You know, thick, glossy paper.  Yeah.  You'd find that.  And it was like, I'm going to be jerking off for years.  What are the odds?  Gold.  You're just walking through the woods.  That happens all the time.  People were always hiding them. 
[03:34:30]  Or you'd find another, like, another neighborhood's tree fort.  What the fuck was that?  And you'd crawl up into their tree fort and find a stash.  This is growing up on Long Island.  I like how I'm still over here like I'm going to get puked on.  Yeah.  Can you not move your chair into the black belt?  I didn't jerk off.  I didn't jerk off until I was 16 years old.  Wow, really?  That was the first time I ever jerked off.  I was getting laid before I was jerking off.  Really?  Yeah.  And I figured out while I was getting, I had this girlfriend and she moved from where  I was to like 90 minutes away when I was like 16, 16, almost 17. 
[03:35:00]  And, you know, I would only see her like every couple of weeks or something.  And I was going crazy.  And then I said, well, let me just try jerking off.  That was like the first time I ever jerked off.  Can you go whack at it?  And as soon as I jerked off, I was like, I don't even want to call her.  That chick is annoying.  She won't tell you.  You don't want to shut the fuck up.  That's great.  Tells me what kind of music to listen to.  You don't want to put up and all that shit.  Bitch.  Time to take a nap.  That was another thing.  It wasn't like back then.  It was, you know, you'd get a girlfriend or something and it would be like weeks or something 
[03:35:30]  in between.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it was like a special occasion.  You had a jack in between.  And then like things had, the fucking stars had a line properly.  My parents think I'm going here and this one thinks that.  And you'd set it all up so you could get like a half hour to fuck before a father comes  to pick her up at the movie theater.  On a pile of leaves in the middle of the woods.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It didn't matter.  And then you have to worry about getting her pregnant.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Every month you're worrying.  I used to be like the chemist of the school.  Like at John Glenn High School. 
[03:36:00]  My mother didn't give a shit what was going on.  You know?  She's trying to raise three kids.  She's working like 24 hours a day.  So I'm running a fucking pregnancy test lab in my house.  It was like the late 70s, early 80s and that EPT tests had just come out.  But it was really like you had to put it in a still place for eight hours straight and  a ring would form on the bottom if she was pregnant.  It wasn't just piss on a stick and instantly. 
[03:36:30]  And you couldn't move this fucking thing and it had to stay in the dark.  Like you couldn't leave it out.  So I would go to school and if anybody thought their girlfriend was pregnant, they'd pay  me and I would go out and buy this shit.  I'd get a cup full of the girl's urine and do the test and come back with the fucking  results.  That's hilarious.  That's how I made it.  Some people stole a pot.  Dude, I had to do about 20 a year.  How many?  How many were pregnant?  Yeah.  How many?  Not many.  Maybe one or two that I had. 
[03:37:00]  How long were you?  Did they flush the baby?  No, I had 100%.  They're going for a portion.  How?  What was the reaction?  It must have been.  To the pregnant ones?  Yeah.  It must have been true.  I never told the girls.  It was always the guy.  So they were like, you know, the guy had to go tell the girl.  I wouldn't fucking tell the girl.  Tripper.  Yeah.  Dude, that was my thing.  Dude, one little kick down the steps.  Social studies.  You got gym class with her?  Yeah.  Dodgeball right into her gut.  You throw a fucking baseball at her stomach? 
[03:37:30]  Fastball.  What's wrong with that?  Big A's reading?  What is he reading?  Fat smash diet.  I would not eat green eggs.  Oh, it's up.  It's up.  The picture is up on openathlete.com.  Openathlete.com and foundyourmusic.com.  Twitchell's puking.  That is one of the best puke pictures you'll ever see.  That looks like an octopus tentacle.  Yeah, it's like a monster.  That is some type of monster.  It's an alien face hugger.  I swear to you, it's not photoshopped. 
[03:38:00]  It looks so photoshopped.  Yeah, totally.  That is pure chocolate vomit.  Pure unadulterated chocolate.  It's a scene out of like an exorcist type movie.  Let's go to Texas.  Who is this?  It's Daniel.  Oh.  Hey.  I was hoping it was Danielle.  Oh.  Oh, Danielle.  I was hoping it was Danielle because of the story you're about to tell.  Go ahead.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a truck driver, man.  When I'm going down the road, I like to jerk off.  Oh, great. 
[03:38:30]  I like to jerk off when I drove limos.  Really?  Yep.  I used to jerk off in the front seat.  If I dropped somebody off and I had to drive home like an hour and a half, I'd jerk off  the past time.  Didn't you worry about getting into an accident?  No.  I'm driving by a truck.  I used to deliver newspapers, so I was very good at steering, the steering wheel with  my legs.  Yeah.  I would steer with my knee.  I would drink and drive all the time.  The way I would do it, I'd have a pile of papers next to me, and I would fold the papers, and  I had a bag hanging from the rearview mirror, and I'd stuff the paper in the bag and throw 
[03:39:00]  it out the window.  So it was almost all with my hands when I was steering with my knee.  So I could steer and beat off the chain.  I could even grab my balls with my left hand, do the steering wheel with my right hand,  I'd beat off the chain.  So how's that work for you?  It was good, man.  Yeah.  I just always worry, if I get into a wreck, one of these days, I'm going to be laying  there today with my pants down on my ankles.  Well, you're dead anyway.  That'd be pretty fucking interesting.  That story would have been much better if it was a girl.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  All right. 
[03:39:30]  Let's go to Doug Out Doug.  Doug.  What's up?  Hey, you guys ever actually wake up your girlfriend while jerking off next door?  Yes.  The fucking look on their faces.  It's awful, right?  Have you ever been caught?  You ever been caught beating off?  Yeah.  You lean forward, your head hits the mobile.  Clink, clink, clink.  It makes noise.  My girlfriend got pissed at me once.  Never been jerking off.  Really?  Caught me jerking off.  She walked into my office and I was beating up, back when I lived with her, walked into  my office and I was beating off in front of the computer and she got mad at me. 
[03:40:00]  Didn't anyone fucking knock?  I'm not enough for you.  I'm not enough for you.  Oh, boy.  Really?  Yeah.  I had a girl caught me.  She laughed and jumped on.  Well, that's fun.  That's a good girl.  That's a keeper.  Yeah.  Never got caught.  Oh, complete opposite of what happened to me.  I hadn't banged my ex-wife probably in about seven months.  Whoa.  And I was so used to jerking off next to it.  Well, that's why I cheated on her.  One of those many reasons.  So I was jerking off next to her one night.  And I digress.  All right.  I thought it would be a good idea to like kneel in her face and kind of wake her up while 
[03:40:30]  doing it.  And she rolled over, opened her eyes, looked at me and goes, that's not even attractive.  Oh, that's hilarious.  She rolled over and went back to sleep and I have never had the fucking balls to do that  again.  You should have shot right in her face right when she said that.  How perfect would that have been?  You could have done it and timed it.  I got a good girl right now, man, and I love watching her, you know, diddle herself and  stuff like that.  I can't even bring myself to joke off while she's doing that, like right in front of me.  Like I...  Wow.  You're still traumatized? 
[03:41:00]  You should...  You're still traumatized?  Yeah, definitely.  I wonder if that would work on a rapist.  Just comes at you.  You know what?  That's not even attractive.  Sorry.  He just loses his time.  It depends on how much resolve he has.  That different guy's different about to drive.  We could cure Tourette's and rape.  It's all in at the fucking show, man.  What are you doing, world?  That knife makes you look fat.  Hey, Nick in Jersey, what's up?  I don't know what they have to do with their jizz.  Nick.  No one on your phone.  No, I was right there.  Hello?  Nick.  Yeah. 
[03:41:30]  Hey, Nick.  You're on, man.  You were just talking about jizz.  Hey, I don't know when I was 13, I told my girlfriend how to get a blowjob, and she  didn't want to swallow it.  So we put it in t-shirts, and we shove it underneath the bed, and one day her mom comes  over and we're sitting on her bed watching TV, and she goes, I found these when I was  cleaning.  And I was like, it's orange juice.  Orange juice?  She's like, orange juice?  Orange juice doesn't stick.  Oh, man.  I was like, well, you know what it is. 
[03:42:00]  I know what it is.  And that was it.  And that was the end of that relationship.  You said that?  You know it is, and I know it is.  Yeah, let's just stop this.  Yeah, let's just stop this charade here.  Cut the shit, mom.  Yeah, try to cook dinner, please.  Tell your daughter to swallow and your laundry problem don't be so bad.  Hey, Big A, what were you reading?  We got a mic for him?  Can you come by next Friday, by the way?  That's a good one.  The news was a hit.  Yeah, if I can.  All right.  Actually, I was reading the Fat Smash Diet. 
[03:42:30]  Oh.  I couldn't really hear the show out there.  You should read the Head Smash Diet.  No?  I thought maybe, you know.  Let's just maybe look at his head.  I don't think that Big A needs to be poked fun at.  All right, Jimmy, you're right.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Finish up.  Thank you very much.  Fat dope, yeah.  Tim.  His fucking head's like an anvil.  You can take that? 
[03:43:00]  You really shouldn't take that from Bill Burr.  He's exercising his fingers, though.  You can take that from Bill Burr?  What did I say?  He heard you.  No reason to be abusive.  My head's like an anvil.  I heard you.  Oh.  I'm trying to pay attention.  He's got great hearing.  He's got good ears.  I'm trying to pay attention to Big A, but that picture of Christina Aguilera's ass right  next to him is, how great is her fucking ass?  This makes it very easy not to look at Big A.  Oh, look at that.  Joe's jerking off.  I'm ready.  He just decided.  If you can do radio eyes for 30 seconds, that's all I need. 
[03:43:30]  That's all you need.  Joe can do radio, cup his balls, and jerk off.  It doesn't matter.  Move the mic with his knee.  So, Big A, you want to lose some weight?  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I definitely have to lose weight.  You should start lifting.  You look like you can fucking put on some brawn.  That's probably a bad idea, though.  Yeah, you don't need him any stronger.  He has a little confidence.  We saw pictures of him.  Get over his S problem. 
[03:44:00]  From high school and stuff, and when he was a young man.  Quite strapping.  Oh, yeah?  Very athletic.  You played what?  Was that back when he was starring in Mel's Diner?  Oh, wow.  Mel's Diner?  Nothing.  Well, who's in Mel's Diner?  Nothing.  I don't get the car crash on that.  Who was in it?  Mel's Diner.  Who was the guy who played Mel?  Oh, you mean Alice.  It was called Alice.  Vic Tayback.  Oh, yeah.  You got the show right.  He does look like a young Vic Tayback.  I didn't...  I think it was a movie.  Vic Tayback.  Wow, you got to know the guy's name. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, who doesn't?  That's pretty good.  It's terrific.  All right, well, good luck with the Fat Smash Diet.  All right, you do any of that jacking?  Yeah, a guy's got to do what a guy's got to do, right?  What do you look at when you jerk off?  What do you think about or look at?  And do you move your fingers like that?  What do you look at?  Probably ogreish.com.  Pops up the latest Al Zarkawi beheading and fucking...  The Star Report.  What do you fantasize about? 
[03:45:00]  What's your cup of tea when you're jacking?  Black chicks?  Yeah, what's your poison?  Let's go.  What is it?  Come on.  What's your poison?  Everyone's got theirs.  What's the one site you go to?  Come on.  Mine's the kids.  What's yours?  What's yours?  Asians?  Stop being so shy.  Let's go.  Don't be shy.  Blowjohn pictures?  What is it?  Big A.

[03:45:30]  Who's your favorite porn star to jerk off to?  It's okay to say white.  That doesn't make me crazy if you say white.  What is it?  What do you jerk off to?  What do you like?  Don't.  Come on, man.  There's a lot of pressure.  No, it's not.  What are you jerking off to?  You jerk off.  Of course you do.  He just talked about jerking off delivering newspapers.  Everyone.  Yeah.  I never jerked off delivering newspapers.  I don't want to...  There's a lot of people out there that were my customers.  They feel real bad. 
[03:46:00]  No.  Never jerked off on your paper.  Oh, Greg, the Boston hurl.  Come on.  It's easy.  Just blurt it out.  Come on.  What do you jerk off to?  Let's go.  What's your fantasy?  Me, it's Asian girls giving head.  I don't know why.  Really?  All right.  That's good.  It's always been.  It's good.  Wow.  Not like Japanese.  I like Thai.  I like dirty jungle girls.  Girls that look like Vietnamese girls just came out of the bushes. 
[03:46:30]  That's what I like.  Is it like that or those chicks like on...  You ever see the movie Bounty?  Where the HMS Bounty goes to like one of those places and all the chicks are just topless  walking around and all the sailors are banging them.  I don't want natives.  I want like Big Kong.  Like VC bitch.  Yes.  Like the sniper girl in a...  Like the girls who steal money.  You know, they're coming up to me.  Come on.  I suck your dick.  Me so haunt me.  Yeah.  And then the guy comes up and grabs you when he runs off.  He likes war-torn pussy.  War-torn.  Thai pussy.

The killing field.  Yeah.  What is it?  Big A.  Who's your favorite?  Come on, Big A.  Give us something.  Puerto Rican?  What do you jerk off to?  Do you go old school?  Do you go like Ginger Lynn?  Do you go Tracy Lourdes?  Do you go new school?  Let's start with race.  Hustler Magazine, classic porn with black and white.  Joe's admitted he gets off the Paul Potts biography. 
[03:47:30]  What is it?  Actually, we have like all females.  All females?  No, but there's a niche.  Everyone's a cop-out.  Everyone's got a niche.  You don't jerk off to Oprah Winfrey, my friend.  Right.  Is it big boobies?  Is it black girls?  What is it?  I guess big breasts.  Big breasts.  Big breasts.  Okay.  Big breasted women?  Yes.  Yeah?  What are they?  Are they chubby or thin? 
[03:48:00]  A little chubby.  A little chubby.  Now, do you like just the pictures of women or do you like women sucking dick, taking in  the ass?  What are you like?  Doing stuff.  Holy shit.  A woman.  Big A.  If the FBI.  Do you like to give them blowjobs?  Yeah.  There you go.  If the FBI got hold of your hard drive.  How many years were you there?  What would they find?  How many years?  A lot of correspondence with Gary Glitter. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, so a little chubby, blonde, brunettes, redheads.  What?  Doesn't matter?  It doesn't matter.  Come on them all, right?  Yeah.  Of course.  What's your recurring fantasy?  I know you have one that when you have no porn, there's got to be one thing that you  scrap to more than once.  For a quick one.  Where you got, you just, you know this one works all the time.  Your go-to.  What's your go-to mental Rolodex jerk-off thing? 
[03:49:00]  Um, I guess it has to be the time I saw Flower Tucci in here.  Who?  Flower Tucci.  Flower Tucci?  Flower Tucci.  She's a big ass girl.  Oh, I don't know her.  Yeah.  Wait, who's Flower Tucci?  That wasn't one of those.  Sprayed in your face.  Nice choice.  We had her on the show?  In here?  The girl sprayed in his face?  Oh.  Oh, the girl that's sprayed in your face?  She's sprayed in your face?  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  They painted a bullseye on his face, and he was sitting there like the bulldog on a Mack truck. 
[03:49:30]  Just standing there, and she let loose, and it went all over his face.  Oh, whatever it is, it's delicious.  I love squirt.  Really?  More than I love breathing, I love squirt.  Wow.  It's some kind of female ejaculate, which probably consists of mucus.  Whatever.  No, no.  It's clear.  It's like water, dude.  It's fucking...  I have had girls dump a bunch...  What does it taste like?  It...  Yeah, really nothing.  Occasionally, you'll get like a little tinkle flavor mixed in, but it's not piss, believe me.  Tinkle flavor.  It's not piss.  It's amazing. 
[03:50:00]  I love a mouthful.  I'm squeezing a little lemon in your water.  You are so fucking sick.  No, dude, you've had it, right?  It's fucking...  That was really good.  What's better than that?  A little lemon.  I had it on.  What's better than that?  It's tremendous.  No steak?  There's a little...  It's like a little assault of it first, and then you get...  Oh, okay.  It's warm.  Yeah.  It's fucking hot, man.  Tate Fletcher from the Ultimate Fighter television show, season three.  TateFletcher.com.  Yep.  Very good.  Yeah.  That's true.  The Death Squad should get their plugs in today.  Hell yeah.  Twister.tv.  It's just a pleasure being here, watching you guys work, the vomit, the...  Oh, yes. 
[03:50:30]  Watching us.  Our craft.  Honestly, that's the best reality show on TV.  Tate was locked up in the house for six weeks.  He just got out.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was trapped.  Come see me in Atlantic City.  Yeah.  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  He was on the Ultimate Fighter.  He was on the show.  In the house.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You're sequestered for six weeks.  So you're not allowed to have cell phones, no newspapers, nothing.  Karen Philly, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just have to say, I think it's the hottest thing ever when my husband jerks it. 
[03:51:00]  Really?  Even to other girls?  Well, yeah, that's pretty hot, too, but I like it more when he jerks it for me.  Now, do you like that because you're a pervert, or are you lazy?  I think it's a little of both.  You're lazy?  A little bit.  Does he ever ask you to blow them, and you're like, oh, God.  Do I have to?  No, actually, no.  I'm usually ready.  You're usually ready?  I'm ready for that. 
[03:51:30]  Good for you.  Oh, you're a good egg.  That's the worst.  You have to get one of those girls who's like, I just have to be in the right mood.  Yeah.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Well, then you must not be in the mood for a ride home, either.  Yeah, because if my girlfriend ever says, will you lick my pussy?  Yeah.  I mean, there's never a time where you don't want to eat your girlfriend's pussy.  Fucking dude, I'll eat it with a log coming out of the other end.  Who cares?  Yeah, I don't mind period, either.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't like that.  No, I'm on my period.  Who gives a fuck?  It tastes like copper.  Who gives a shit?  Dude, periods are gross.  It's just blood. 
[03:52:00]  It's just no difference between blood and pussy juice.  It's all the same.  Just says the guy from Fear Factor, though.  So it's rare.  We should expect this.  Dude, you can bang a chick on her period?  Fuck, yeah.  I'll eat a chick's pussy when she's on her period.  I don't give a fuck.  If I got a hard-on, dude, I don't give a fuck.  I'll lick her ass right when she gets out of the gym.  Sweaty and dirty ass.  But for some reason, the blood thing freaks you out.  I like raw armpit.  I like raw armpit. 
[03:52:30]  I do.  As opposed to cooked, like I enjoyed last night.  Feet.  All that shit is fine with me.  Ass smell.  What's wrong?  Eddie Bravo has the best stinky pussy feet story ever.  Are you here?  Dude, tell the stinky pussy feet story.  Please.  It's the greatest story of all time.  Tell the whole strip club DJ thing.  Yeah, we have time.  I can't give a background.  All right, I DJed at a strip club for 10 years, and there was this one chick who I was making moves on for a while, but she had a boyfriend. 
[03:53:00]  She finally moved out of her boyfriend's house and moved into her best friend's house, which was like her best friend still lived with her mother.  So she was living with her best friend's family, and she needed a ride home after work, and this is like 2.30 in the morning.  She's been stripping for six hours, 27 lap dances.  You know, but this chick was super hot.  Her nickname was Hot X.  I mean, she was super, super hot.  So I drove her home the first night, and I couldn't go inside. 
[03:53:30]  She couldn't have me come inside.  She's staying at a friend's parents' house.  But she was loked, and we just parked in the driveway, and, you know, she just – at first, she would just suck my dick.  She didn't want to fuck, so she sucked my dick the first couple times I drove her home.  And it was cool, and I was like, eventually, I'm going to get this fucking pussy, right?  And I kind of noticed that her feet were kind of stinking.  Oh, no.  I kind of noticed that, but, you know, they're in, like, the tall-ass pumps, like, for six hours. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  Grinding cock, you know, working, sweating.  Sweating.  You know, that's not easy shit.  You know, they all got nice, developed quads and shit from pushing.  Well, anyways, she finally decided to give up the pussy.  We're in my truck, and we're in the driveway.  Like, right in the driveway, there's a light, but I had the windows tinted, so I'm like, let's do this shit.  I throw her in the back seat.  I start fucking her, and her pussy was so fucking rank.  It was disgusting. 
[03:54:30]  But I've dealt with stinky pussy before.  I've dealt with that.  And, you know, you kind of, like, hit them doggy, start to, like, turn away, you know, a little bit.  But this bitch's feet, the feet and the pussy, it was like – I call it a swirl of death.  It's like, you smell the feet, you smell the bad pussy, but you can't, like, distinguish – it's like a combination of –  It was so bad, I was fucking – I opened the goddamn window.  I'm like, it's getting foggy in here, you know, like it mattered, you know. 
[03:55:00]  We were driving.  And the crazy thing about her is that she didn't – she had a big smile, she was getting fucked, she couldn't smell anything.  Oh, my God.  And it's – I don't know, just the combination of the feet.  And I had to sit her down.  She was so hot.  I had to sit her down.  I brought out her nutrition book.  Wow.  I was like, under vaginosis or vaginitis, it said, you know, a possible cause for this is a lack of – or deficiency of the B vitamins.  So I'm like, listen, there's nothing wrong with you. 
[03:55:30]  Holy shit.  You just need to get some more vitamins.  And I told her and I explained to her because she was so hot.  How did she react to that?  She was so cool.  You know, we started going out.  We went out for like six months.  She would – she was a vitamin freak.  Good Lord.  How hot was she?  She would show up to my house.  She must have been.  Yeah, she was super hot.  Show the position with the feet up in the air like where the swirls.  Oh, when she was like this, man, when she was like this in the back seat, she had like her feet right here and like the pussy was right there.  And, I mean, I had a – there was some decisions going on.  It wasn't an easy decision. 
[03:56:00]  Like, should I stay?  Should I just keep fucking or should I stop?  Dude, what did she – what did she – what did she – what did she – oh, lick my pussy.  Oh, fuck.  It was death.  It was death.  Dude, did the vitamins help at all?  You know what?  I don't know if it was the vitamins or the fact that she just cleaned her pussy up or like douches it or something, but it never stunk after that.  And, you know, it went out for like six months.  Did you have milky white stuff on your hog?  Because sometimes if you pull it out and it looks like you have like a little Elmer's on it, that's fucking like a yeast infection.  Elmer's.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:56:30]  Plus, TV –  You know what?  I don't know.  Eight hours.  It was just death.  I'll tell you one thing.  Get pussy odor.  DPO.  That's funny.  You say that after that, it didn't stink.  She left a lasting impression, though, that first time.  Yeah, you know what?  You know?  That shit doesn't just go away out of your mind.  Well, she showed up to my house.  She's a vitamin freak.  She would show up to my house to hang out.  You know, she spent the night like quite often with a duffel bag with big fucking vitamins.  You know, big bottles of vitamins.  She was taking all that shit.  Wow, man.  That's a good story. 
[03:57:00]  It was pretty bad.  Right on.  No girl likes a stinky pussy.  That's a very good story.  What's worth it, a guy with a little dick or a girl with a stinky pussy?  Stinky pussy is not as bad because you can't fix a dick.  Yeah.  Have you ever had a lap dance with a girl that had a stinky pussy?  That's happened to me, too.  I've had lap dances from strippers that just stink.  Like, strippers fucking, they stink.  No, but a lot of them do that shit on purpose because it's a way to keep guys from really  like groping.  Not all guys.  What?  They stink on purpose?  They'll come in, yeah, they won't shower or something like that. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, really?  It's like they're playing in the NFL.  It's just the whole night.  Yeah, they're like B.O., yeah.  All night, they're dancing.  There's nothing they can do about it.  And they put on that perfume, but it cuts right through it.  You're like, oh, stop already.  All right, we should take a break.  We'll do one more break and get out of here for the week.  Joe Rogan.  Hey.  Borgata.  Borgata.  Borgata.  Borgata.  Tonight.  Tonight in Atlantic City, if you're in the area, his comedy is unbelievable.  Check out Joe, man.  At the Borgata.com.  I don't have a number.

[03:59:00]  Let's say hi to Shwuggy.  Shwuggy, what's going on today, man?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Here's a joke story.  It probably tops them off.  Get right back into it.  This is back in college, back in the mid-80s, before VCRs really took off.  By the way, can you tell we're making up for the fact that we have to be radio-friendly in the morning?  This has been the filthiest show we've ever done.  Good.  Yes, continue, Shwuggy.  Sorry.  So, anyway, I'm in one of the porno booths upstate at school. 
[03:59:30]  And I remember explicitly, it was a Ginger Lynn and Tracy Lord scene.  So I finish up and I open the door.  And who's just standing in the lobby?  Rich boss.  Five guys from my floor that I live on.  Oh.  So, very, very rough.  So they know you beat up?  Very, very rough.  Ah, it's a little bit different when you're 18, though.  That's not bad.  That's like hearing up in a buddy booth and you look over and it's your dad.  That's a great story.  Let's know.  All right, let's say hi to No Filter Paul. 
[04:00:00]  The window goes up.  Hey, buddy.  I just wanted to call Big A out.  He's such a total liar about who he jokes off to.  Oh, shit.  All he does is hit on my wife all the time.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Let's get a mic on.  Yep, forgot about that.  Big A is infatuated with No Filter Paul's wife.  Yep.  All the time.  Every time he's around.  Wait, hold on, Paul.  Paul, hold on.  He can't hear you.  Sorry.  Okay, now he's got his earphones on.  All right, yeah.  He's always trying to hold a hand every time he cross the street.  He's, oh, let me help you across the street.  Is that true? 
[04:00:30]  You guys really need to find a girl.  Now you're on CBS.  You should be able to find a girl.  You call her a lot?  Yeah.  You call her.  It doesn't.  Yeah.  He's got a bit better.  But you really need to find him a girl.  A girl?  A girl.  Hi, Davey Jones.  I'll ask him why he's drunk.  One of the Beatles.  Look what you've done to me.  Ask him what?  Ask him why he drove to Florida to try and get a girl from Peltoc.  Why?  What?  Did you drive to Florida?  You drove to Florida for a girl from Peltoc?  I was going to just... 
[04:01:00]  Hold on, Paul.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's a story here.  Go ahead, Big A.  Don't be shy.  What was that?  I had nothing to say about that.  Oh.  Nothing to say about that means it happened.  If you ask me, did I drive down to Florida to fuck a girl from Peltoc?  Are you pleading to say no?  Anthony?  He is...  He's not fessing up, but I think the Dade County Sheriff's Department probably wants to hear  something.  Right.  There's nothing wrong with a man trying to get laid.  Absolutely.  So you spent a day driving down to Florida. 
[04:01:30]  You found a girl on Peltoc.  Was she surprised when she found out that you weren't also eight?  You found a girl on Peltoc.  What happened?  No.  You did.  Paul?  Did you see her picture?  She was camming up?  Was she cammed up?  Paul?  Did she give you an address or did you just go, I'm going to just start at the top of  Florida and work my way down?  Tallahassee.  Hello, Paul.  We're back and forth. 
[04:02:00]  I'm looking for Stacy.  He scanned Florida.  Paul.  Welcome to the Keys.  This is my last hope.  Paul?  I'm telling you nothing?  No, tell us, Paul.  Maybe you're not telling the truth.  Maybe that's why I'm beginning to talk.  You know, I'm going to tear the third wall down here now.  The third wall.  The third wall.  Name is not going to get mentioned unless you guys figure it out.  Paid him to go get this girl because they both thought they had a shot.  Someone paid Andrew to drive down and pick a girl up. 
[04:02:30]  So it's a kidnapping is what you're talking about.  You're describing a kidnapping.  Someone paid.  No, he flew to Florida and he got in a car with someone who he drove back up to New York  to go to some patch with.  Uh-huh.  And then, right after, he drove all the way back down to Florida again.  To drop her off?  Yeah.  Did you get anything from her?  Yeah.  And flew back.  Not as far as I know.  No, I'm asking Andrew.  He steps on CDs.  Wait, he's lighting. 
[04:03:00]  I already know who he means.  Imagine if he turned around and all it said was...  Wait, when Andrew showed back up in New York, did he have muddy shoes with leaves in them?  What does the little sign say?  Somebody's name.  She was only 12?  Let me see the...  What's that to me?  Let me see the name.  Turn it around.  Let's see.  Why, Big A?  Don't be so shy.  Wow.  You didn't do anything wrong.  Are you still having relations with this girl, so you want to protect her identity?  No, he doesn't decapitate and tell.  Did you pet her hair in a barn because her husband, Curly, was giving you flack? 
[04:03:30]  Oops.  Wow.  They're so delicate.  Nothing, Big A?  Nothing.  Tell us a little.  We confess everything.  I confess to having my grandmother find my loads all over.  I've confessed to having trannies blow me, or ate tranny.  That wasn't a Freudian slip.  Fucking twichels ate and threw up.  I mean, we've all contributed a lot here.  Yeah.  Confessed to a capital murder charge.  What happened, man?  You don't have to tell the girl's name for privacy reasons. 
[04:04:00]  I mean, I'm just a friend of mine.  Okay.  So, that's all.  Did you bring her up because somebody else wanted to, like, meet her or hook up or something,  so you were just, like, a limo driver here?  Were you just, like, a cab driver?  Or did you think that you maybe had a shot?  Not at all.  Well, she didn't want to drive up alone. 
[04:04:30]  And I was just a body.  A body.  And now so is she.  Without a head.  Well, he's crossing state lines here, so it's already a felony.  Right.  Whatever he did.  So, wait a minute.  You went, you flew down.  Yes.  Whose car?  Her car?  Yes.  Okay, because she didn't want to come alone.  Right.  So, you flew down.  You drove up with her.  Yes.  She hung out in New York, and then she drove you back down because she didn't want to be  alone, and then you flew back from Florida? 
[04:05:00]  That's correct.  Okay.  So, you spent a lot of time in the car with her.  Yeah.  Yes.  Were you nervous?  Were you stroking her thigh?  Not at all.  Did you sleep on the way up?  Did you try anything?  Did you try any moves?  No, I didn't try anything.  No, how, did you continue the drive straight through, or did you stop at a hotel?  Yeah.  No hotel, it was. 
[04:05:30]  Straight.  Who bought your plane ticket?  Yeah, who paid?  Neo.  Oh.  Neo bought your plane ticket?  Neo's involved.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  I've heard almost everybody else knows about this, you know.  Well, it's harmless.  You flew to Florida.  You didn't do anything wrong.  It's not a big secret.  You flew to Florida.  Why would he buy your ticket, though?  Yeah, why would he in Arizona?  Jesus Christ, everyone on PalTalk knows, by the way.  I mean, it's all over the whole thing. 
[04:06:00]  There's a lot of questions coming in.  Nick in Chicago.  Nick in Chicago.  Big A.  Where's Natalie Holloway?  I flew to a horrible...  She didn't want to go to Carlos and Charlie's alone.  She said she could swim.  We went to the lighthouse.  So he flew you down to basically just be a friendly escort so she wouldn't have to drive  alone because he might have had a thing for her. 
[04:06:30]  Wow, you think Neo was hoping?  No, anything about that.  One extreme to the other.  You could pull your cock out in the car and say something like, suck or die.  Absolutely not, no.  Oh, absolutely, I thought he said it.  All right, hey, Dave in Tennessee has a question for Big A. Dave?  Hey, rather than waiting for him to stumble through this, we can catch this all on Dateline  next week.  Yeah.  Set your T-bos now.  You went to see her and a reporter came out and fucking... 
[04:07:00]  Why did I just steal the joke and reword it?  To pick somebody up.  And then I'll just do it.  Those losers.  The guy had a good line and I figured I'd reword it and you'd do the impression and we both...  And I'd jump on your coattails.  As I was dying, you figured you'd go down with the ship.  And one more for you, please.  That fucking pal talk is its own little environment.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's its own little civilization.  Yeah.  There's cliques.  There's, like, gangs.  It's people that know stuff, people that they don't want to know stuff. 
[04:07:30]  There's people with feet in their asses.  There's a lot of dudes beating off, too.  Yeah.  A lot of Arab guys.  Get one of those cams seem like a good idea until they actually...  They just...  Literally within two seconds of just going around there, we literally...  Is that an arm?  Yeah.  Oh, it's a leg.  There it is.  Look, you go adult.  Please don't.  I don't want to see that again.  Playground.  Don't be shy.  And then just go, ladies making men hard, pop up a couple of cameras, and before you 
[04:08:00]  know it...  Bang.  Look at Eddie Bravo.  Where are the...  Bill, look.  A lot of guys.  Not much jacking.  Ah.  There you go, Bill.  It took one, two, three, four, five.  It's no big deal.  I play porns.  I'm just talking about that.  Open the guy with the cowboy hat.  He's my favorite.  Six clicks before magic guy one is just jacking away.  It's disturbing when they're jacking off with a semi.  Look at that guy.  Look at the guy with the...  He's really horny.  Ew.  What a weird technique.  What an awful technique. 
[04:08:30]  He's just like massaging a jet.  He goes all the way down the balls and opens the hands.  Yeah, he's using a very unique technique.  It's almost like...  He looks like...  His hands are moving like Bela Lugosi.  It's like he's playing a guitar.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Disgust balls.  Paul, anything else before he lets you go?  Not already.  I just wanted to say, you know, I like Big A.  He's a good guy in person.  And a lot of these fucking bimbos on PowTalk, they just use him.  Oh.  No.  And it just sucks for the guy because, you know what? 
[04:09:00]  I don't know if he just didn't have much attention earlier.  What do you mean they use him, Paul?  Because of the show, you know?  They use him for a ride up and back to Florida?  Yeah.  What else?  I had a VIP pass to the Pats thing.  How else do they use him?  I mean, because you'd hate to think somebody's making a fool out of somebody,  especially after their stomach got stapled for a radio show.  Okay, good point, good point.  All right, so how else do they use Big A?  He's our friend.  No, they just use him.  They just hang around him because he's on the show. 
[04:09:30]  So what's wrong with that?  It's Big A's hanging out with some chicks.  Good for him.  Yeah, but you know what?  He doesn't get anything.  You know, we need to find him a nice girl.  He's a nice guy.  I like him.  I really do.  And I know him off the show, you know, and he's a different guy off the show.  We understand.  He's a saint.  So how are they using him?  They just, everything a girl normally wants, but then doesn't give anything back.  I don't know.  Ask Big A, for example.  I don't know.  Big A, for example.  Give him more personal life out.  Do you realize that Big A and Neo make Master Blaster from Thunderdome? 
[04:10:00]  Neo could just sit on your shoulders and you could rule the brain and the brawn.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Do something to him.  Have a good day.  That wasn't an expose.  That was nothing.  It was stupid.  Victoria Rocano is here on stage 27 with a story every woman should see.  That's right, Pat.  Star Jones Reynolds made headlines when she admitted to a breast lift. 
[04:10:30]  Now a housewife is in desperate need of a breast reduction.  I'm taking you inside the O.R. as the insider goes in depth.  I'm so uncomfortable in everything I wear.  I end up wearing shirts that are, like, tense.  I'm totally uncomfortable.  37-year-old Carrie is a victim of her enormous breasts.  I'm not comfortable with the way I look.  I'm not comfortable with the way I feel.  She hates her appearance.  Lives with excruciating pain.  And is desperate for change.  Actually, I have thought about suicide and I had an accidental... 
[04:11:00]  It really was accidental overdose.  She thought about suicide because her tits are too big?  Someone slap that bitch in the mouth and take her to Ethiopia.  Yeah, get her with her.  Fucking friends for a doctor.  Look at all the other people with real problems, you dumb cunt.  Big A is staring at me.  Your tits are too big?  Are you mad at me, Big A?  I don't want to comment on that at all.  Of course not, Jim.  Why would I ever be mad at you?  I don't know, are you? 
[04:11:30]  No, of course not.  No.  You can tell him.  No, I'm not.  He's not.  Why are you mad at me?  Jim, I'm not mad at you.  Big A, what happens when you get really mad?  Yeah, we don't want to know.  I don't think you ever want to know that.  What's the worst thing you ever did?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, what is the worst thing you've ever done to another human being?  I pet the rabbit.  Yeah, you got some UFC guys in here.  Pretty rabbit.  They would like to hear this.  I've seen it, man.  I've seen it.  You get it in your forehead and your eyebrow when people start talking about you. 
[04:12:00]  They brought you real close to snapping before.  Is there somebody walking around or maybe limping around hobbling or something that just  always remembers you every day of their life?  Does the neighbor's dog talk to you?  No.  What's the worst thing you ever did to somebody?  Fight?  Nothing really.  Yet?  That you're scared to talk about.  I'm not a fighter, you know.  I'm just big and tall, but I'm not a fighter.  But in your younger days, you looked like you could be a little bit of a bruiser. 
[04:12:30]  Not really.  All right.  What may be a violent fantasy?  You've been picked on enough to have anger.  One dude who just wouldn't leave you alone.  You're like, someday I'd just love to fucking...  To twist his head off.  To show his nipples.  He was much happier with the breast conversation.  All right.  Back to this.  A startling size 42 Double D coping with crippling back pain from her 20-pound breast... 
[04:13:00]  Deal with it!  ...forced her to take heavy medication, which prevents her from working.  I cannot teach if I'm on any narcotics for liability reasons.  So I have not been able to work.  This increase in your breast size has actually stopped you from moving forward with your life.  Yeah.  Go right past the scrub sink right here.  So can Carrie find relief?  How are you feeling?  A little nervous.  We're inside the OR as she undergoes a revolutionary breast reduction procedure.  And you fellas have safety glasses on. 
[04:13:30]  How about you, John?  Yes.  Safety goggles.  I'm creating a laser bra right now with the carbon dioxide laser.  Jimmy.  Jesus.  I had an ex-girlfriend of mine who had a tit reduction.  Yeah?  Reduction, yeah.  Yeah.  Before I met her, she had huge tits and she had them...  It was real weird because they cut the nipple off.  They cut the nipple off and they make a scar that goes straight down to the chest from the nipple.  Like a straight line down and then below it.  So it's like...  Wow.  Like they fillet you.  It's a lot of meat.  They scoop out the meat and then they tie it all back up together. 
[04:14:00]  Doesn't she lose all nerve feeling in her nipples?  One.  She had one nipple that was very sensitive.  It was normal.  And the other one was just useless.  It was gone.  Useless nipple.  The other one was like an elbow.  What?  First, Dr. Grant Stevens, who invented the laser bra technique, draws on Carrie's body to outline how the surgery will proceed.  Then, Carrie's put under anesthesia.  Okay, we're marking these nipples at 42 millimeters.  I was right there for the dramatic procedure. 
[04:14:30]  What we're doing now is creating the laser bra.  The laser's taking the outer skin or epidermis away and leaving the dermis.  Here's your insider info on the cutting-edge surgery.  It takes only two hours, can be done as an outpatient procedure, costs between $5,000 and $15,000, and actually preserves the nipple.  We laser around the nipple.  We keep the blood supply to the nipple intact, and we move the nipple up, attached to the breast at all times. 
[04:15:00]  The rest of the breast tissue comes around and lifts the nipple from underneath.  So if you want to breastfeed after a breast reduction, you could.  Oh, it's weird to look at.  It's Franken-titties.  It's in the circle, the line.  So she had this.  She had this line down here all the way from chest to chest, or from tit to tit, and then two lines down, and then big scars around the nipples.  It was very strange.  Wow.  And how long?  She had back pains.  She had huge tits at that point in time. 
[04:15:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, like Fs, you know?  So how long after she had it done did you see them?  Two years.  Two years, and they were still, like, prominent scars.  It was like, you know, they were bumpy.  And they were just titties that just completely didn't fit her body once they were, like...  Yeah, they were just enormous.  Can you imagine that?  The girl just, like, as she's going through puberty, like, okay, enough already.  Stop.  They just keep...  Yeah.  Yeah, it was bad.  And after you get the breast reduction, you can breastfeed.  That's great for a husband.  Your wife has big tits, and then she gets them shrunk and has a kid suck on them.  Why don't you just fucking push her under a lawnmower? 
[04:16:00]  She now has a C-cup, and we've reduced about 10 pounds of breast tissue.  So how does Carrie feel today?  I'm thrilled with the outcome.  The pain is almost completely gone.  Now, there are other stars who've admitted to a breast reduction, including Queen Latifah  and Punky Brewster's Soleil Moon Fry.  Yes, Punky Brewster got her titties...  Yeah, he got a little too big for her.  Billy, you wanted to tell a story after the break.  I forgot to...  Oh, we were on the stinky pussy subject.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[04:16:30]  I've been unbelievably lucky.  I've only had one really bad one.  I was in a movie theater.  I was watching some movie, and I started fingering this girl that I was with.  There was literally people in my row.  How old were you?  There was people in my row.  That's like how fucking nasty this girl was, so I shouldn't know.  How old were you?  I don't know.  There's something you're doing.  You're 29.  Yeah, you know, 18, 19.  Last week.  18, 19.  Oh, I'd still do it today.  If I could just do it, take your dick out, why not?  You were babysitting, it was Finding Nemo. 
[04:17:00]  Look, I wasn't into the movie.  I wasn't feeling the plot.  So I literally fingered the girl, and I did what you always do.  Then you got to kind of bring it up and smell.  And the funny thing was, it was right at the pivotal moment where you're going to figure  out who the murderer was or whatever.  What's the movie?  Do you know?  You're going a long way back.  I can't remember.  Selling.  Anyways, the bottom line is I fucking bring it up.  I bring it up.  And it was, I think about a foot from my face, and I was like, you've got to be fucking kidding. 
[04:17:30]  I literally just got, I just said, I have to go to the bathroom.  And I literally got up, and I just fucking, with that awful movie soap, I was gone for  like 10 minutes.  I think I came back, the fucking credits were rolling.  And I just made up an excuse.  I mean, you figure if you're fingering the girl in the movie theater, there's no way you're  not fucking, you know what I mean?  Right.  I was just, I just bailed.  I just bailed.  One of my first girlfriends from high school always had a stinky pussy. 
[04:18:00]  She just always had a stinky pussy.  And every time we would fuck, right afterwards, like the morning, I would go to take a leak,  and the smell would just rise up and waft.  Like I'd be peeing, just going, what the fuck is wrong with me?  It's hard to wash that shit off.  Yeah.  It's hard to wash that shit off.  Wow.  Oh yeah, I couldn't eat with this hand for like a day or so.  I just couldn't even bring it up.  There are certain smells that can just go away when you wash your hands once.  That's not one of them.  Barely.  One of them, yeah, is that.  The other one is if, God forbid, you don't have enough toilet paper or a little, it slips 
[04:18:30]  to the side for a minute and you hit, you know, ground zero.  You gotta go bleach at that point.  It doesn't matter how much.  You can scrub.  It's gone.  And then like five minutes later, you give another, it's back.  It just attaches itself.  It's got grappling hooks in your, yeah.  It grows.  Spores.  Stinky pussy has gotta be one of the worst.  It's nature set it up to let you know that you definitely shouldn't be doing anything  with that.  It's not breathing stock.  It's just a giant morning red flag. 
[04:19:00]  It's not good breathing stock.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  What purpose?  I mean, you can still get a girl pregnant while that, why would it smell so bad?  What is that?  It's nature trying to protect you.  Yeah.  Let's see how Twitchells is doing so we can get out of here.  Oh, wait.  We got the, I didn't know this.  Got the girl that Bill was at the movies with.  Yep.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  Bill.  That was rude.  Ladies and gentlemen, Twitchells.  Yeah, hi. 
[04:19:30]  Hey, Twitchells.  He's back.  He's probably crashing from the sugar rush.  5,000 calories of sugar.  Dude, he looks so normal.  He doesn't even look like he's got Tourette's anymore.  There's so many more Almond Joys to be eating.  I know.  He's got a Brad Pitt haircut.  Did you hear what he said?  Joe goes, it doesn't even look like he has Tourette's anymore.  And he goes, I wish.  Wishes don't come true.  Had a hell of a day, Twitchells.  Jump?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He is crashing.  This guy is so tired, man.  You know what? 
[04:20:00]  I get a lot of emails saying, why are they torture you?  And it's not torture.  I have so much fun.  I just, I don't know why I do it, but I feel good.  You went through the gauntlet today.  Whatever.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  Eat a poor almond joys got nuts.  Eat a poor mounds don't.  Eat cold.  Sometimes you feel like a nut. 
[04:20:30]  Sometimes you don't.  Oh, motherfucker.  Fuck.  Tom Sizemore.  Oh, I've heard about that tape.  That's Tom Sizemore.  That's great.  Coming.  All right, Twitchells.  So what do you got?  Anything?  You all right?  What do you mean?  Well, we want to know how you.  I puked a lot of it up.  I shat a lot of it.  Shat.  Shat.  Shat.  Do you feel queasy still?  A little bit.  They got it.  Ryan got me.  One of the guys, Ryan got me some Pepto.  Dwayne Reed and I co-did a little bit. 
[04:21:00]  There you go.  All right.  I feel a lot of calm.  I feel a lot of calm.  It's really cured the Tourette's though, it seems.  Well, like I said, I mean, the Tourette's come and go.  They act up sometimes and then they go away.  We did help it along with the four or five Red Bulls.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It was just four.  I just had four.  Just four.  Just four.  No, you know.  That's not too many.  40 candy bars.  Don't jump it up to a higher level.  Let's get out of here.  We're tired.  Big ain't up.  Oh, there's a guy on there that knows how to get rid of pussy smell.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[04:21:30]  Talk to him.  Talk to him.  It's called a fucking cinder block at a lake.  Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hello, guys.  What's going on?  What's up, Dave?  Yeah, I just got a tip for all the men out there.  If you get the stink finger or the stink dick, what you want to do is take your fingers,  soak it in acetone or nail polish remover.  It gets rid of the stink right away.  Soak your dick in that stuff?  Holy shit.  You're not going to shoot.  No, not nail polish.  It's a cotton ball.  Just shove your dick in nail polish remover.  Just fucking clean it off and get on with your day. 
[04:22:00]  It's pussy.  You know what happens if you got acetone down the tip?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Are you crazy?  You thought that aftershave on your balls hurt.  Oof.  All right, Dave.  That's how we end today.  Well, you know how you fucking get the stink off your dick?  And the next morning, you find another girl to suck it.  Gangsta fag.  We should play some gangsta fag before we get out of here.  Yeah.  All right.  Bill Burr 1st, May 19th, Electric Factory in Philly.  Yeah, Philadelphia.  Thanks for stopping by today, Billy.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  We're very tired.  We did about five and a half today. 
[04:22:30]  I have a plug.  Yes, Jimmy.  May 12th with Dave Attell, the Orpheum in Boston.  Okay.  Ticketmaster.  And I think Rogan's show tonight is sold out.  Seriously?  Oh.  The Borgata.com.  Try it for Joe at the music box.  Certain tickets were not available, so try it.  And see if you can get tickets to see him tonight.  All right.  Bravo.  Joe, thanks for coming by.  Thanks for having me.  This was a great time.  Always a pisser, man.  Always a great time.  I wish I lived in New York.  I know.  Really did.  I did it all the time, man. 
[04:23:00]  We'll start calling the show more.  Okay.  I got to get up.  We love when you call the show.  Get up at like four in the morning.  Yeah.  I usually do it when I stay up.  Like the other day, when I called in, I was playing video games all night.  All nighter.  Well, now we start at like three.  We need those times.  We're playing these days.  Quake 4 and Doom.  Doom 3.  I just got a new Alienware set up.  Just been playing.  Play Counter-Strike at all?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  A bunch of little fuckers just nailing your ass.  Yeah.  I used to be a Quake 3 junkie.  I used to have a real problem.  Yeah.  I'm on like eight hours a night.  I was Half-Life all the time. 
[04:23:30]  Yeah.  It's so addictive, man.  It's so fun.  I know.  All night long.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  All right, man.  We got some Gangsta Fag.  You want to set this up, Joe?  You turn this on for the Gangsta Fag.  All right.  This is a story with Gangsta Fag.  A buddy of mine was selling T-shirts, and this guy hit on them, and he gave him this CD.  He said, yeah, I'm a rapper.  He gave him this CD, and the CD was this shirtless, muscular guy, and it said Gangsta Fag.  He was like, what the fuck is this?  And this thing, this CD sat in my house for like two years before I ever listened to it.  And I listened to it when we were over my house, and we were doing photographs for Eddie's 
[04:24:00]  Jiu-Jitsu book.  So the first time we ever listened to this, we're half naked, with like fucking shorts  on, in my garage.  And the garage doors are open, and this guy's taking pictures, and we're going through wrestling  positions.  And my fucking pool guy shows up.  My pool guy shows up, and he's walking through my driveway, looking in the garage, listening  to Gangsta Fag rapping, while guys are wrestling in their underwear. 
[04:24:30]  He wants it.  It was one of the gayest things ever.  Run from the faggot.  Run from the faggot.  Guess you picked the wrong motherfucking fag to fuck with.  Sounds like you've listened to him more than once.  Dude, it's hilarious.  He's good.  That's the crazy thing about it.  He's actually a good rapper.  You know, the music's pretty good.  It actually sounds pretty good.  God damn, he's scary as hell.  He's huge.  And he really is that guy, right?  Your friend met him?  Supposedly.  No, I'm supposed to meet him.  But he's not avoiding me at all.  He's like, yeah, when do you want to set it up?  And so I'm supposed to, you know, supposed to meet this guy.  Show up in spandex. 
[04:25:00]  I want to, we're going to videotape me and him having ice cream together.  That'll be cute.  Ask him about prison rape and shit like that.  Oh, shit.  We had him on once.  He was pretty unruly.  Some asshole that was under my fake name.  They made a MySpace account with my name, and it's a fake one because I have mine.  You know, if you're anybody, people make fake ones.  I went to his and sent him a message that I was Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  I listened to the music, and I really like, you know, if you could rape me. 
[04:25:30]  If, like, out of nowhere, just, you know, I've always had this fantasy.  So, let me, you know, and he wrote back saying, you know, no, I don't do that, you know, I'm glad that you're into me and all.  But I, and I wrote him back like, you fucking fag nigger.  I don't want to.  Jesus.  Well, I had to be blunt.  Jesus Christ.  I had to let him know I didn't want any part of him.  Jesus.  That is the way to do it. 
[04:26:00]  Wow, Anthony, who said that.  Why not just, thanks, but no thanks.  The whole part of adding that in is the fact that I really, really had to be offensive to let him know I didn't want that, and I wasn't just calling to be.  I think you were actually kind of making him want to do it.  I think you, good point, Bill.  Good point.  You were taunting him.  I know if I was a gay black man.  You were saying, take the white ass, I double dare you.  That's basically what you said.  See, the more offensive it is, the more he knows, don't touch. 
[04:26:30]  I got things to back it up.  Rogan, his friends, please, help me.  They'd hold you down just for the story.  So he's banging him.  Rogan, give you one of the pot lollipops.  Yeah, suck on this.  You'll kill the pain.  Oh, I thought, you know, and Joe's just laughing at me.  You'd be like Twitchels gagging when we got black cock instead of chocolate.  Yeah, the video and pictures of that are online.  Let's get out of here.  Come on, man.  It's Gangsta Fag.  He wants it. 
[04:27:00]  He wants it.  He's still, that's another reason we got to get out of here.  He's scared.  He's farting like crazy.  It still smells like puke in here.  It smells like rotten eggs.  Joe Rogan, until next time, thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It's Gangsta Fag.  We're out.  See, I was getting high with my boys one day. 
[04:27:30]  Just kicking back, hanging out in L.A.  When this dude drove by in this really funky band.  I could tell right away this motherfucker had things.  Was a white dude, about 30-something.  Cept staring at me, yo, like he wanted something.  He called me over and he asked for directions.  I saw his dick was hard, so I peeped his car.  I said, you dying.  You know you ain't lost.  You want to suck my dick while I'm jacking you off.  And he said, oh no, there must be a mistake.  I got a wife and a kid, and I'm very, very straight.  So I said, take my number and my name.  You can call me up when you're sick of playing games. 
[04:28:00]  As I walked away, yo, I knew he would call.  Because if you see one fag, they can see them all.  He will say.  So what the fuck you think, he needs him.  So what the fuck you mean, he wants him.  Because if you see one fag, now you'll see them all.  He wants him.  So what the fuck you mean, he needs him.  So what the fuck you think, he wants him.  Because if you see one fag, then you'll see them all.  So I knew that he'd be climbing the wall.  One week later and he finally called.  He said his family's gone for a week or two.  And he was really bored and needed something to do. 
[04:28:30]  So I drove to his crib up in Beverly Hills.  A bald man's house worth a couple of meals.  He said he was a gay, he just wanted to chat.  And I had five or later, he massaged my back.  In his wife's room, he gave me some hair.  Went in the next room, fucked on his kid's bed.  Fucked and we fucked like bitches in here.  I came on his face and all over the sheets.  I knew that I was done when I started getting sore.  I grabbed the kid's toe and I wiped my dick off.  He's lying on the bed, still trying to recover.  I'm dressed and I'm out as my car.  So what the fuck you think? 
[04:29:00]  So what the fuck you need?  Cause if you see one thing, then you've seen them all.  So what the fuck you think?  So what the fuck you need?  Cause if you've seen one thing, then you've seen them all.  The thing was so good that he just could pass up.  So hold that week, yeah I'm tearing that ass up.  Cause he loves to ride him and he loves to suck him.  And after I was done, I let my homeboys fuck him.  Now his punk ass calls me every day.  I told him we were through, then he said he would pay.  So now twice a week, I'm getting paid to tap him.  He lates me with the cash and the V's of platinum. 
[04:29:30]  One month later and the cat's out the bag.  Cause this motherfucker started dressing in drag.  But I did my thing and I had my fun with him.  It was time to cut him off, because I'm done with him.  Crying like a bitch and he's starting to beg.  He's falling on the ground, holding on to my leg.  Screaming don't leave, please twist it G.  But this is what you get when you fuck with me.  So what the fuck you think?  So what the fuck you mean?  Cause if you see one bag, then you've seen them all.  So what the fuck you mean? 
[04:30:00]  So what the fuck you think?  Cause if you see one bag, then you've seen them all.  You know, I'm twisted.  This is Trump's life.  Trump is not gay, okay?  I want you to stay away from Trump.  He is not gay.  We have a family and a son.  And we have a life together.  You stay away from me, son of a bitch.  I just don't.  I hope you don't.  For the little storm, I'm calling.  I miss you.  I miss you.  Twister, please go. 
[04:30:30]  Please, I miss ya.  I miss you fucking talk.  I miss you fucking talk.  I'm so fucking mad.  I love me.  Twister, please.  Fucking call me.  Don't be good.  I see.  Please, please, I'm a little bit of a guy.  Please.  You're finished with the shit. 
[04:31:00]  All done.  All right. </pre>
