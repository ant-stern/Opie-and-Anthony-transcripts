<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the unexpected return of "Phone Call Thursday," much to the hosts' annoyance.  Callers recounted near-miss accidents involving bicycles and cars, ranging from humorous near-misses to a tragic story of a friend killed in a cycling accident.  This was followed by a discussion of a missing college student who was also an internet porn star, focusing on the discovery of blood at a suspect's motel.  Other news items covered included a local news anchor's questionable attire, Opie hitting a pedestrian, a listener's brake failure, and various other listener-submitted anecdotes.  Jimmy's return to the show was also noted, along with speculation about a former Howard Stern associate's absence from Casino Cinema and a news story about scattering ashes at Disney World. The hosts also planned their New Year's Eve show. The overall tone was irreverent and crude, filled with profanity and sexually explicit content.

The show continued with a message from Toucher and Rich, followed by a discussion of a Long Island man arrested for using his son's urine to pass a drug test.  This transitioned into a story about a doctor with a massive child pornography collection.  A chaotic call from Brita, characterized by profanity and erratic behavior, ensued.  This led to a discussion of "MySpace voodoo," focusing on the discrepancies between online and real-life appearances of women.  An eighth-grader, Andrew, called from a school bus, followed by Crash from the Toucher and Rich show, who recounted spreading his mother's ashes, half in the ocean and half at Disney World's "It's a Small World" ride.  More calls detailed experiences with deceptive MySpace photos, and a picture of Rich from Toucher and Rich holding a "Iron My Shirt, Bitch" sign was shown.  The segment concluded with further discussion of MySpace photos, the New Year's Eve show, and a brief appearance by Colin Quinn, who commented on sports and MySpace experiences.

The focus shifted to a detailed dissection of deceptive MySpace photos, with the hosts and callers describing techniques women used to appear thinner or more attractive online, using graphic descriptions and derogatory terms.  Callers Tara and Elena shared their experiences with deceptive profiles, with Elena recounting a bizarre story about her husband being jailed for a threatening message from a fake profile using his picture.  Jennifer expressed concern that her own MySpace page might be discussed.  Colin Quinn was a guest in the studio. The segment ended with discussions of a man planting a hidden camera in a bathroom and another man masturbating in stores and posting videos online, concluding with more banter between the hosts and Quinn, including promotion of his upcoming shows.

A lengthy and raucous discussion with Colin Quinn followed, attempting to delve into his emotional state, which included a period of depression after his divorce.  His “manifesto”—a large, disorganized body of writing—became a major topic, along with anecdotes like leaning precariously over a balcony.  The hosts frequently insulted each other and Quinn, interspersed with attempts at sincere conversation about his mental state and career frustrations.  A challenge to say something nice resulted in awkward compliments followed by a return to insults.  The conversation touched on his dissatisfaction with the entertainment industry, views on race in comedy, and a caller's complaint about a canceled Florida show.  Discussions of movies, including *Raging Bull*, and comparisons of cinematic preferences between racial groups were also included, ending with promotion of Quinn's Gotham Comedy Club appearance.

The final segment featured a contentious debate about Spike Lee's films, anecdotes about Patrice O'Neal, and a discussion of *Scarface*.  The hosts then showed a video of "Two Girls, One Cup," eliciting strong reactions, including vomiting from Quinn.  Reactions from others, including a grandmother, were discussed, along with other internet sensations like "Chocolate Rain."  Listener calls led to tangents and arguments. The concluding segment included reminiscing, arguments, final remarks, and a chaotic ending, mentioning Bob Kelly, Rich Vos, and Bill Burr, with continued promotion of Quinn’s Gotham Comedy Club appearance.

[00:02:00]  Ah, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I guess I can take my coat off, huh?  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Not that bad in here.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  A long sleeve, huh?  Hi, Jimmy. 
[00:02:30]  Jimmy's back.  Hi, boys.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  Tino's back.  Barney, Tino's back.  I was hoping we were going to get something fun on the HD this morning.  Oh, I know.  Yesterday was great.  Oh, you'd have loved it, Jimmy.  It was a little special on some African people.  And the ladies weren't wearing any tops.  Yeah.  But some of them, you know.  Oh, very, whoa. 
[00:03:00]  Very long.  Most of them.  Yeah.  The only one that wasn't was some girl they were trying to marry off to some guy.  And she had to be all of 13 or something.  And even she was showing signs of gravity.  I don't know.  There must be more gravity over in Africa.  They run braless everywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It must be what it is.  Thank God for the brazeer.  Well, today...  Ah, it's a car thing.  Oh, well.  Turn off the HD discovery.  We were excited. 
[00:03:30]  We thought we could check out another African boobie show.  Yeah.  African boobie show.  Let's go to Jared in Rochester.  We never say hi to Rochester for some reason.  What's up, Jared?  What's going on, guys?  How are you, bro?  Pretty good.  You know, I thought I'd just be the first caller.  Oh, no.  You know.  Oh, no.  No.  Are you...  No.  Oh, no.  What?  Well, something's going on here. 
[00:04:00]  I think they're revolting against us.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  They are revolting.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I called to tell you.  I miss Phone Call Thursday.  See.  Phone Call Thursday was the best.  No, it wasn't.  Sucked.  See, that's what Jared was getting at.  And you suck.  Let's say hi to Mark in Delaware.  Mark.  Yo, Oak.  Anthony.  Hey.  Good morning, Mr. Kumia.  A little Jimmy.  I just miss you to death.  Thank you, fella.  I just wanted to be on number three this morning. 
[00:04:30]  Happy Phone Call Thursday.  But I thought we tried to get rid of Phone Call Thursday.  Yeah, what happened?  As a joke, we said Thursday is now talk like Tim Thursday, but that never took off either.  I thought we were finally done with Phone Call Thursday.  No, it's a fan favorite forever.  Has to be.  No.  It doesn't.  What is this?  Oh, my God.  We got production and everything.  What's that?  Who saw this coming? 
[00:05:00]  Everybody.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Just waiting for something to queue up.  It's the return.  It's Phone Call Thursday.  Phone Call Thursday.  Phone Call Thursday.  Remove the receiver and listen for the dial tone.  It sounds like this.  It's Phone Call Thursday.  I hate Phone Call Thursday.  Phone Call Thursday.  Thursday.  Phone Call Thursday sucks.  See, this is what happened. 
[00:05:30]  We truly were trying to get rid of Phone Call Thursday.  Yeah.  Came up with talk like Tim Thursday.  That did not take off.  So the people, they're clamoring.  They're clamoring for something to do on Thursdays with this radio show, Ant.  And now look at the phones.  Look at the phones.  Why are they lit up?  Why are you people?  I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  Because Phone Call Thursday just returned, officially, to the Opie and Anthony show.  And it kind of sucks because I was ready to start a bid, and now we can't start the bid 
[00:06:00]  because now the phones are lit with people that wanted to say hi.  Oh, yes, we can.  Well, Chris in Middletown wants to say something that's very pertinent that we noticed.  Yes, Chris, we noticed exactly what you're going to say, but go ahead.  It was beautiful this morning watching that.  Jill gets up on TV, and it looks like it's a little cold in there this morning.  Yeah, Jill Nicolini on the Channel 11, the local news here that we watch, she looked a  little chilly, a little chilly this morning in the studio. 
[00:06:30]  You could see some things, especially during her first break.  And then I think they might have pulled the tape out.  They might have pulled some gaffers' tape out for the second break.  Oh, really?  It wasn't as noticeable?  It wasn't as noticeable.  Maybe they start their show in a cold studio like we do every morning.  Yeah, yeah.  See, I, too, look.  Oh, please don't bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl bl.  Ever again?  Your headlights.  But you also notice that Jill's a little cockeyed. 
[00:07:00]  Well, you know, sometimes you got to adjust things in the brassiere.  Sometimes girls got to adjust.  Or else they go all Marty Feldman on you.  Well, she was a bit cockeyed, but I'm thinking what's going on there.  There's so much stress inside that brassiere that it's just being pushed into other areas of the bra.  Other directions.  It's not able to just naturally sit there.  Yeah.  There's just too much stress. 
[00:07:30]  Too much beef.  Oh, wow.  Now we get to see naked pictures of her.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock, there it is.  I wonder if she wants people to forget that she did this back in the day.  No.  Why would she?  Well, when we talked to her, she was still proud that she posed for Playboy, right?  Why wouldn't she be proud?  Kill Nick Leaney, just throw that in the search.  You'll find it eventually, E-Rock, for the people out there that need to see it.  Yeah, that's her, all right.  All right.  Wow.  I have a taxi story, by the way, when we have a moment to do that. 
[00:08:00]  Oh.  Should we get the Harry Chapin music started?  Is it the show or an actual taxi story?  As I was leaving here last week on my way home.  What happened?  Did you get in a car accident?  Well, some kind of like an accident.  I wouldn't say yes.  We're driving, and I was talking to him and annoying him as to which way I want him to go,  and we were headed toward the horses on Central Park South, and we did hear a loud thud,  and I heard the cabbie go, ah!  And I saw a homeless guy fly over the hood of the cab and smash against the windshield. 
[00:08:30]  He had hit a homeless man.  Get out of here!  He hit a bum on a bike.  He hit a bum on a bike, and the guy looked like Grady from Sanford and Son, which is how  I knew he was homeless.  It was really disturbing, because it happened so fast.  I heard, like, ah!  And then you see the guy thud, bounce off the window, and I'm like, he just killed a guy.  You just saw him bounce off the window?  He bounced off the window, dude. 
[00:09:00]  He hit the, he thudded off the hood, the window, and then hit the ground.  And he just laid there.  I'm like, this guy's dead.  And five seconds later, he pops up, and a cop pulls up, who had been right by Columbus Circle.  And the homeless guy's like, I'm all right.  I'm all right.  And, uh...  Jesus Christ, another commercial?  What is that?  I don't know. 
[00:09:30]  You okay, sir?  Sir?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  He was, uh...  He was okay.  And the amazing thing was, the cabbie was such scum, because the guy...  It was the homeless guy's fault.  He came right out in the green and got hit.  But when the cop's like, uh, you want to do anything?  And the homeless guy's like, no, I'm all right.  And his bike had a huge dent in the wheel.  It was like a crescent moon, his bike wheel.  So, and he rode off on it?  No, he pushed it. 
[00:10:00]  He was pushing it.  It was like...  The wheel couldn't turn.  But the homeless guy goes to the cabbie.  He goes, uh, you want to give me $20?  And the cabbie should have thrown him $20.  Uh, and the cabbie's like, uh, no.  No, I don't.  So the homeless guy's like, all right.  Like, he just didn't know how to drive a hard bargain.  He was like, all right.  And he just walked away with his broken bike.  Could it have been like a scam he does?  No.  Because the bike was dented.  He really hit by the car.  But the cabbie wouldn't give him $20?  No.  And all the...  He's insane.  The homeless guy could have said, you know what?  Uh, the light was green for me. 
[00:10:30]  Absolutely.  And immediately he could have gone to the hospital.  And the cabbie's insurance, when you hit a person, your insurance goes up more than  $20 a year.  Yeah, I would think.  And that dummy didn't give him any money.  And he said what the homeless guy did is, as the car was about to hit him, he said the  homeless guy looked, and this is the genius move.  He took his legs, and he raised his legs real quick.  And so the bike is what got hit by the car.  The fender didn't hit his shin or his leg.  Oh, smart.  What a great move by a guy who doesn't understand that you shouldn't go to the bathroom in your 
[00:11:00]  pants.  That man doesn't understand that inside is better than outside.  And yet he knew the physics of lifting his legs just in time.  In a crisis.  So yeah, that was...  It was amazing.  You must have felt like they were filming a movie or something.  He was okay.  As you're watching, it's like, this has to be a movie.  Yeah.  Wow.  Does it look like it does in the movies?  Is it cool?  Does it come out of nowhere and just like surprise you?  It's so fast.  Because the cabbie's reaction, I heard, and he was veering towards the horses. 
[00:11:30]  I'm like, oh my God, he's going to hit a horse.  And then when I heard that, like, ah, and the thud, you just see a man bouncing off the  windshield.  Like, wow, that's cool.  We were moving too, man.  We were doing 20, 25 miles an hour.  Did he break the windshield?  No, he did not break the windshield.  It was more, I guess the impact is mostly on the hood.  It's probably all the padding of all the coats the homeless guys are wearing.  Yeah, true, true.  That'll save them.  It's like hitting a big cotton ball.  A dirty cotton ball.  A big, filthy, smelly cotton ball.  One that's used to, like, clean your shoes.  Oh, by the way, I was in a hotel, and I had suede shoes, and they do this thing where 
[00:12:00]  they'll brush up your shoes for you.  And I had something with my girlfriend.  We're going to go see her family.  And I'm like, all right, let's do it.  And they shined my suede shoes.  What?  I don't know.  They're foreign.  Aren't they ruined?  They're horrible.  She said they look like a homeless guy's shoes that, like, have been polished up.  They are terrible.  They ruined them.  They ruined my shoes.  They bought me new ones.  Why would you polish them?  I don't know.  My $90 rock porch, because I have bad feet.  My feet. 
[00:12:30]  It's hard for me to walk.  I have fat feet.  Oh, that's funny.  I need wides.  And tragic.  Yeah, like, eight and a half wides.  Yeah, let's say hi to Joe in Connecticut.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  I'm just calling to welcome Jimmy back.  Oh, she's trying to, um.  I think it's a guy that sounded like a girl.  Is it?  Because they're doing the talk like a him thing.  Girl?  Guy or girl?  I'm a guy.  I'm a man.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve, what's up?  By the way, I want to welcome Jimmy back. 
[00:13:00]  You should have given away the gender.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Good morning, Opie.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi.  That's it.  And the phone call, now watch this.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Let's say hi to Frank in Cincinnati.  Frank.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Frank.  Hey, how are you guys doing this morning?  Just checking in.  We want to welcome you to the radio program.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Oh, okay.  A question. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, okay.  Good.  On Casino Cinema.  You know, Howard's old lady used to run on that thing, right?  Is she not on that anymore?  Yeah.  Her and Steve Sharippa.  Yeah.  What's going on?  How come she's gone?  Did Howard not let her work here anymore?  What's up with that?  I really don't.  For the most part, I don't pay attention to Howard's life, so I really don't know.  Maybe she moved on.  Oh, I just.  I just see that one.  Go ahead, man.  Maybe she just moved on to the projects.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Maybe she moved on to another dude.  Maybe another guy or girl or something like that.  Who knows?  All right, sir. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you.  I did that show.  I just wanted to welcome you guys.  We'll see you.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Did you?  Yeah.  Hello, boys.  I love my book.  Very nice.  First of all, phone call Thursday.  I don't like it.  I love it.  Ron and Ferris, noon to three.  All right.  Very good.  We're trying to, like, open up the phones, though, because we've got some things to talk  about.  We used to do phone call Thursday because we were just killing time.  We were lazy.  There was a period there where we were a little lazy, and now we don't need phone call Thursday, 
[00:14:30]  anymore, because we've got actual things we want you guys talking.  So stop it.  The lazy period was from 2000 to mid-November 2007.  Tim, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I live in Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  I'm making a right off of a side street onto a main road.  Yeah.  And that's why they tell you to ride your bike with traffic.  Oh, well, yeah, with traffic.  You're right.  So, yeah, I'm looking out my driver's side window. 
[00:15:00]  I make the right-hand turn.  This guy comes off like the curb, kind of like in the air.  I had a little chev...  I took him out.  I took him out at his bike.  He went flying over, like, into the other lane.  As I swerved to miss him, I hit his wife.  Wow.  Did he kill her, or is she all right?  It was...  So, no, no, I didn't kill anyone, but he was all bloody and drunk.  They had two bottles of Budweiser on him.  And in the police report, it said two bottles of Budweiser were found at the scene. 
[00:15:30]  They were frothy and fresh.  Wow.  Yeah, it was pretty wild.  Wow.  All right, thank you, sir.  Well, good for you.  No, you don't.  No, Kathy, Virginia, what's up?  Happy phone call Thursday.  No.  Let's see.  No, I just wanted to call and tell Jimmy that I listen every morning.  I didn't realize how much I miss him.  When he's gone, it's terrible.  I really like him.  Oh, thank you, Kathy.  Thanks.  I like you.  Well, he's back, so... 
[00:16:00]  I'm glad you're back.  I missed you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Kathy.  Thank you.  Thanks.  We got lots of good things to talk about today on the show.  We got a missing girl that led a secret life as an internet porn star.  Yes, we were looking at some of her pictures.  We were perusing some of her pictures online.  How does this...  Huh?  Is it Tub Girl?  Tub Girl.  My favorite.  A naughty one.  How does this story go?  Girl is missing.  College student?  Oh, okay, yeah.  A missing Kansas college student believed to be the victim of foul play apparently led a 
[00:16:30]  double life as an internet porn star by the name of Zoe Zane.  Nude photos of 18-year-old Emily Sanders appeared on a Zoe Zane website before she vanished, and  investigators are looking into whether her modeling had anything to do with her disappearance  last Friday.  I would say yes.  Yeah, I think that would be an absolute yes, right?  Yeah.  She enjoyed it.  She's a young teenage girl.  She wanted to be in the movies and enjoyed movies.  She needed the extra money.  Nikki Watson, a close friend of Sanders, at Blah Blah College.  Nobody in El Dorado knew besides her close friends. 
[00:17:00]  Sanders' brother, Jacob, confirmed that the nude woman picture on the website is his sister.  Oof.  Sanders was last seen leaving...  The brother had to identify the pictures.  By a mole on the thigh.  Sanders was last seen leaving a bar in El Dorado about 30 miles from Wichita with a man identified  as Israel Morellis, 24.  Sanders and Morellis had met that night at the bar, according to Watson.  Oh, boy.  After Morellis did not show up Saturday at his job at an Italian restaurant, his employer 
[00:17:30]  went to the motel room where he was staying.  His motel room was found to appear in great disarray.  Great disarray.  Great disarray.  And a large quantity of blood was found in the room.  What the F did this guy do?  A large quantity of blood.  That's not good.  No.  Bed clothing was found...  It's not like, ooh, I was shaving.  Or, ooh, I was shaving and five gallons of blood ended up on the floor.  Probably raped her and killed her in a panic or a drug and then just beat it out of town. 
[00:18:00]  Well, and then it says bed clothing was found to be missing.  So now he has to pile up the bloody sheets and blankets.  Get rid of that evidence.  Believe the rest of...  He must have, like...  He must have tried.  Like, all right, maybe I could clean this motel room up and no one's going to notice.  And then halfway through, it went, oh, my God.  All right, let me just get rid of the body.  I got to get the F out of here.  Just the body and I'll leave the blood.  Sandra recently signed a contract for the pornographic work on the website and told her parents about  it on Thanksgiving. 
[00:18:30]  Watson said, oh, happy Thanksgiving.  Yeah, her boyfriend...  I'm a porn star.  Her boyfriend broke up with her because he did not approve.  Of course not.  So there you go.  She was living a double life.  Wow.  Was she having sex in the porn stuff or was it solo stuff?  Do we know?  I think it was pretty much...  All I saw was solo pictures.  Like webcam stuff, right?  Oh, that's pretty hot.  No, like hot pictures.  Really?  And he didn't like that?  No, I guess not.  I guess he was just banging guys.  That would probably disturb me.  That's all we saw, though.  Who knows what she was doing?  If she went to the bar and just picked some guy up and goes to a hotel room, maybe she 
[00:19:00]  was hooking or something.  Oh.  I'm just speculating.  Wow.  Yes.  That's hot.  Maybe that was going on.  But then again, why the blood?  I mean, who knows if any of the guys are crazy people?  He might be a crazy person.  Guy was probably one of those nuts.  Let's say hi to Eric in Jersey.  Eric?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Eric.  Okay.  So I was driving my car.  I got my car fixed.  I was driving home.  And I'm going, this kid, like, comes down in front of me, like an eight-year-old kid  on his bike.  I slam on my brakes, and I just, like, nudge him, but it was enough to knock him off his 
[00:19:30]  bike.  So I'm shaking.  I'm freaking out.  The mother comes running up to my window, and she's like, she's like, are you okay?  And I'm like, I'm like, yeah, is he okay?  She's like, ah, tell him not to ride my street at any hall of time.  Don't worry about him.  And I'm like, well, all right.  Let me go.  It was great.  Oh, so there you go.  You got out of that one, huh?  Yeah.  I thought I killed the kid, but she's like, oh, are you okay?  Don't worry about him.  Wow.  It was funny.  That's good, though.  What a little woman.  It was funny.  Trust me.  Trust me when I say it was funny.  I never hit anyone.  Knock on wood.  I've never had anyone roll off my windshield before. 
[00:20:00]  No, it's, when I was 15, my friends Chris and Jason were crossing Route 130 in New Jersey,  and Chris saw Jason get hit on bike.  He was killed.  He was, they were on their bicycle.  That was the first friend I had that was killed.  Happy little story.  Thanks.  Well, I'm just saying that, like, it really messed Chris up bad.  Yeah.  Like, he was literally right behind.  They were, like, you know, following your friend across the highway.  Yeah.  And he got clipped, or his friend was following him.  But he got a good clipping at 60.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's awful.  A little bike one flying. 
[00:20:30]  Let's go to Adam in Middletown.  Adam.  Shoes.  Did he come out of his shoes?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Yeah, where they just.  Everyone comes out of their shoes.  The shoes just sitting on the side of the highway?  Yeah.  Awful.  Adam, what's up?  Not much.  I had a kid on a bike one time.  It scared the shit out of me.  Oh, did it.  I just got my driver's license, and I was driving to get my parents some food for dinner.  And I pulled out from an intersection.  This little black kid on a bike just all of a sudden appeared over the hood of my car. 
[00:21:00]  I almost shit my pants.  Scary shit.  How about you try to keep it clean for the radio?  Does anyone understand?  I'm sorry, guys.  I'm listening on XM.  I forgot.  Yeah.  I'm actually watching as you're talking about this footage on Channel 7.  Of, like, safety testing.  They're showing a guy getting hit.  Yeah.  Like, it was like a dummy.  Like a dummy.  You know how they have those dummy simulations?  And the car.  I thought you meant like a retard.  Oh, no.  The car would have been dented.  He would still be standing there eating his, like, multicolored lollipop.  And the car would be dented around him. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  He'd hit a light pole.  Just big cartoon.  And he would just be jumping up and down in a circle with, like, the swirly multicolored  lollipop.  Right.  And a hat with a propeller on it.  All right.  Listen.  Stop with the phone call Thursday so we can get some real phone calls on the show today.  We've been doing real well with that.  877-212-ON-A.  Jimmy's back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Bad boy radio host.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:22:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Chris has reminded me that I did hit somebody.  I like what Jimmy saw the other day, though.  Chris, go ahead.  I know what you're going to say, but go ahead.  You say it.  A couple of weeks back, I remember we had a story about hearing a guy, and he just  hauled off and punched the mirror off.  Yeah, punched the side view mirror right off your car.  I'm noticing something about the phone calls. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know if it's this guy's call, but this is the second call in a row where the  quality has been kind of bad.  We'll have to take a close look at that.  Well, yeah, I tapped a guy when I was driving out of the city with Anthony one day back in  the day.  I tapped him, though.  I tapped.  Because the light was green, and the guy decided he was going to show me who's boss by just  strolling across the intersection.  That's what the pedestrians do.  If there's too much traffic for you to cross the intersection, even though you have a green 
[00:23:00]  light, you do the right thing and you stop, because you don't want to be in the middle  of the intersection when the light turns red.  But then when traffic clears up in front of you and you're able to go because the light's  still green, the pedestrians have been crossing in front of you.  And they should notice that you now have an opening.  The light is green for you and let you go.  I don't care if they're on the crosswalk.  They got that big red hand that says, don't walk.  And that's when I will just and go and get him out of the way. 
[00:23:30]  And this guy didn't want to move.  And so Ope kind of rolled up a little bit and gave him a little hip check with his vehicle.  And the guy didn't find it amusing, funny, or anything.  He walked up to my side where I was a passenger.  So I, as the tough guy I was, quickly slammed down the lock on the door.  And he punched the side view mirror right off the truck.  But it hung there from the cable that you used to adjust it.  Yeah, I tapped a monster, basically. 
[00:24:00]  This guy was a monster.  And, yeah, he, one swipe took out that side view mirror.  And then that thing hung with that wire or that thick wire.  Just scraping the paint off in a perfect circle.  For months it just turned into a, yeah, perfect circle on the side of my car.  And the car was nice at the time.  It just ruined my car because of my stupidity of tapping this guy on the intersection.  I was driving one time down Route 130 again because I grew up around there.  There's a lot of, oh, my God.  I was almost killed when I was still smoking pot.  Me and my friend Steve Jackalona. 
[00:24:30]  Steve was an animal.  He used to smoke cigarettes in his car and then just flick the ashes on the rug.  He was a savage.  We were both high out of our minds one time.  And we were crossing Route 1 on Route 130.  And we were crossing the light.  And we heard,  And a gas tanker had run the light.  Wow.  And you do see your life flash before your eyes.  I saw it.  It was in an instant.  I saw everything.  And Steve jammed on the brakes. 
[00:25:00]  And the rig had to be doing 70 miles an hour.  The back two wheels on the 18-wheeler yanked our bumper off.  Wow.  It was that close to being under the trail and being completely dead people.  An inferno.  It was.  The bumper got ripped off.  And the guy pulled over.  And then Steve actually stopped and pulled over and talked to the guy.  And they exchanged insurance.  And then we got in the car and drove across the highway.  And Steve pulled over and cried. 
[00:25:30]  It was just a delayed reaction that we almost got killed.  That was.  It starts sinking in.  It was like your body.  You go into shock.  It's almost like when a relative dies how you prepare for the funeral.  It's almost like you avoid the horribleness of it by doing things.  Yeah.  And that's what this was.  The insurance exchange was a thing.  It was a process.  And we crossed the highway and pulled over.  And he wept like, I don't know, like some grandmother.  To quote Brando in Apocalypse Now.  But I didn't think anything of it like he was faggy or anything. 
[00:26:00]  Because I was sitting there going like, you know, when you're high, nothing wrecks your  high like an 18-wheeler ripping your bumper off.  It's a high ruiner.  You got to allow him a good cry after that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  That's something you don't make fun of.  You're like, oh, you should be crying along with him if you had any emotions.  Anytime Jimmy tells a story like that, all I do is picture the animation in my head.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Because that is a perfect story to animate.  Well, because he uses real names, which makes him really funny for some reason.  And I'm just seeing them smoking pot, the little high cartoon characters, driving in 
[00:26:30]  the car, to track the trailer, going, nah.  I'll only use real names if it's not a slanderous story.  Of course.  I'm sure I wouldn't care.  I never cried he's going to sue you.  I did not cry.  I got a picture of me and Steve, because Steve looked like he was 40 back when he was  17.  He said he was like one of the, he had like Donnie Brosco glasses.  I wonder what ever happened to him.  He had these like, they were kind of always tinted.  And I got a picture of me and him together.  I just found when I was like 19 and in my like white homeboy phase, my hat tilted to 
[00:27:00]  the side.  It was just a couple of asses.  No, the real, you should have been hit by that tanker.  It was God driving.  Trying to save me from embarrassing myself.  You're not black.  Let's say hi to Dave in Illinois.  Dave, what's up?  Speaking of trucks, by the way, that's why we go to Dave.  Dave, go ahead.  Dave has a really good story, but I think we might have lost it.  Hey, Dave.  Ran over a guy with my semi once.  Oof. 
[00:27:30]  Is that guy still on the phone?  Maybe his name's not Dave.  I think he's gone.  All right.  You know what I hit one time driving, which is very upsetting?  I ran over a dead dog.  I was coming home one night.  I ran over a dead, it was like a dead German shepherd, but it was a loud thump.  A horrible thump.  And I pulled over, of course, and I saw there was a dead dog.  And I knew I didn't kill it, because as I drove up, I kind of saw something and hit it.  And it was laying in the road.  Yeah, Opie probably killed it.  It had a knife he's sticking out of his liver.  Easy, easy. 
[00:28:00]  Maybe he was just taking a nap and you didn't really kill him.  Maybe he was very tired.  He was made halfway across the highway.  He's like, ah, stretchy.  I hit a big, ugly possum once where, same thing, thud, thud over both wheels, where  the car kind of goes up in the air a little bit.  It's such a creepy feeling.  I pulled over and I saw what it was, and I did cry on the way home because I thought  it was like somebody's pet, and I felt so sad that I killed somebody's pet.  It was around a holiday.  I don't remember what it was, many, many years ago.  The dog is not coming home. 
[00:28:30]  Their parents will just say that the dog ran away.  Don't worry about it, Jimmy.  Were you done?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I had an old Mustang years ago, and the brakes were bad, so I went to get the brakes fixed.  And driving back from the place that fixed the brakes, I'm coming down a hill.  I step on the brakes.  Nothing.  Oops.  I mean, nothing.  They didn't tighten something.  And I'm going right into a main road, like a major road. 
[00:29:00]  There was nothing I could do.  I just shot across this road, and by the grace of God, nothing was coming through at that  second that I blasted through.  But a tractor trailer passed by right after that.  And I'm just thinking, two seconds.  Like if I just would have been driving a little slower.  And I did pull over and just started shaking like crazy. 
[00:29:30]  Like your body just, your mind transfers that to your body, and your body just loses control.  That's a nice shot of adrenaline, that hit.  Oh!  Your adrenaline being released.  I had to, at the end of the road, because the, the, the, I shot out of this road into  a main road, but it didn't go all the way across.  It was just a chain link fence and a sump on the other side.  So I also had to, like, wrench the wheel and turn so I wouldn't fly into the sump. 
[00:30:00]  It was like a movie scenario.  It was horrible.  Your sinuses clear.  You ever have your sinuses clear?  When something horrifying like that happens, it's always, like, I can breathe really well.  Yeah.  When my adrenaline rush is like that.  For a few seconds, yeah.  That's your body preparing for horrible things.  Yeah, your body.  Your body just sucks all the fluids back in.  Your body, like, that's why I want to punch myself in the face sometimes, because my nose  is stuffed.  I'm like, when I have an adrenaline rush, it clears, my head clears.  So it's like, your body can do it when it wants to.  Yeah, then why can't it just do it?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Do it.  Let's go to Al in New York. 
[00:30:30]  Al.  Listen on, listening on camera.  What's up, Al?  What do you say?  Ow.  Ow.  Who are these?  Hold on.  Who are these naked broads?  Zoe Zane.  Oh, that's the gone chick.  Which one is she?  Did you just say Zoe Zane S?  No, chick.  Oh, chick.  Okay.  She's the one on the right?  With the tin man from the Wizard of Oz hat.  Wait, she's dead now?  Well, there was a large quantity of blood found in her hotel room.  Get that off my screen.  Why?  I want to see more of her.  She's hot.  Nah, it's kind of hot. 
[00:31:00]  It's kind of hot knowing she's dead now?  I don't know if she's dead.  She's missing and there was a large quantity of blood.  They're saying that it's not looking good.  She could have killed the guy.  I can still scrap looking at Jane Mansfield's photos.  We all know where her head wound up.  And the old shoulder.  And a bowling bag.  It certainly did.  She was with a friend named Steve who didn't hit the brakes in time.  Oops.  And that little head came right off.  Oh, God.  They smashed that little man.  What a lovely head to lop off to.  What's up, Al?  I'm at home with you. 
[00:31:30]  And none of the guys she dated noticed for three weeks because her cans were so nice.  It's like, finally, she shut up.  That's right, folks.  I'm gone for a few days and I'm back with Jane Mansfield jokes.  You missed nothing.  Hey, Al.  What's up?  Hey.  All right.  I just got a story.  It's almost in the same area on Route 17, parallel.  I first did Daylight Savings, coming, going to work, come around a corner. 
[00:32:00]  I see a tractor trailer on the other side of the road.  And the next thing I know, the world just blacks out.  And the world, everything slows down.  And I'm like, why can't I see the sky?  And I can't figure it out.  And I can see the ground, but no sky.  I realize it's a tractor trailer.  Swing the car to the left for whatever reason, go halfway under the tractor trailer, and  the back wheel kicks me out.  Saves my life.  Wow.  Total cars completely crushed.  If I had a passenger, they'd be decapitated from the shoulders down. 
[00:32:30]  Hold on, sir.  Did you?  Let me discuss his remark about decapitated from the shoulders down.  That's a little.  That's kind of tough to pull off there, sir.  I went from, like, the stomach up.  I mean, it was that low.  All right, wait, but did your...  Stomach up.  Did your...  We all know.  Did your Honda pass under the tractor trailer?  Yeah.  It went...  Like, when I went to the left...  And it's a two-door Honda Civic.  So, when I swung the car to the left, I started to spin out. 
[00:33:00]  So, the entire pass from your side went under the tractor trailer.  That's why it was crushed so low.  Because your instinct is to turn away from it.  Yeah.  I was trying to...  I didn't know where I was going.  I just went to the left for whatever reason.  And then the back wheel of the tractor trailer kicked me out.  The front of my car knocked me out before I spun under, too.  So, another, say, half a second, and you would have been decapitated from the ankles up. 
[00:33:30]  This guy counts...  I had one toe left.  Yeah.  What a buffoon.  If his toe got cut off, he would have said I was decapitated from the middle toe up.  It's all decapitation.  He decapitates himself when he clips his toenails.  Let me tell you what's weird about it, though.  Everything goes in slow motion.  Yeah.  I'm actually looking at my legs and saying, wow, when are they going to be crushed?  I'm waiting for it.  I'm waiting for the...  It is amazing how quick your mind can process what's going on and make you think about things. 
[00:34:00]  You're like, oh, I'm in real deep trouble here.  I hope it ends quickly.  Or I hope, like, I spin out and end up okay.  But it's still going on, and we'll all have to just see how this ends.  All right, that tire's really big, and it's coming towards me.  Like, you might just kind of...  That's the conversation you have in your head, and in real time, that was like a quarter...  It's just like this.  Yeah.  That's it.  Woody... 
[00:34:30]  I never saw anything.  I never saw anything except the sunlight below.  It was the first day of the daylight savings time.  I know.  You said it.  We know that.  All right, Al.  The decapitation from the stomach up.  Woody Allen had a very funny bit years ago about getting ready to be hung, and he's like...  He goes, and my life flashed before my eyes, and I'm seeing myself as a kid at the general store  buying gingham for Emmy Lou.  And then I realized, it's not my life.  He's like, I'm about to die, and the wrong life is flashed before my eyes.  He's a smart guy.  He's amazing.  Roy, New York, what's up? 
[00:35:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah, I'll be right back.  Roy!  Yo!  Roy!  Let's go, let's go.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  You guys grew.  Listen, I used to do an auxiliary police, which is a volunteer police officer here in  New York City.  Yeah.  I was out of the corner doing patrol.  The funniest thing just happened.  This guy's on rollerblades going across the street.  The guy's making a left turn.  Boom!  Knocks him out.  Guy gets out the car, punches him in the mouth, gets back in the car, and drives off.  Wait, so the guy that hit the rollerblader jumps out of his car, and he's so pissed off 
[00:35:30]  he has to punch the rollerblader that he just hit in the face?  Right.  So the guy comes up, guys, can you help me?  He just punched me in my face, but it was too funny.  We couldn't see the plane or the model of the car because the guy just took off.  Did a hell of a job there, sir.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Dave and Philly.  That's what some people find funny.  Dave and Philly not listening on WISB.  How are you, Dave?  All right, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, I love you. 
[00:36:00]  I love the show.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, I got hit about 12, 13 on my brother's bike.  Carried the bike home, bent up in two pieces, basically.  And when I got there, he kicked the crap out of me for looking at his bike.  I had a broken arm from the accident.  Car hit me doing probably about 40.  I ended up in the hospital with broken teeth and a broken arm.  Broken teeth from my brother.  I'm nice, huh? 
[00:36:30]  Your brother punches you because you wrecked his bike?  That's understandable.  Yeah.  I guess when you're 12 or 13, it's understandable.  Yeah, you don't care.  As long as he's walking, you can punch him.  Yeah, you're like, ah, you seem okay.  You're fine.  Now I got to hit you from wrecking my bike.  Let's go to Danny, the trucker.  Almost done with this.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  I was in Philly.  I unloaded my first load, and then I was going across town to pick up another load.  Luckily, I was only doing about 30 mile an hour. 
[00:37:00]  Come across this, I think it was a bowling alley.  There was a bunch of kids out in front.  And there was a dump truck parked on the side of the street, and I had one guy walk right  out in front of me, and I swerved just in time to miss him with the cab of the truck,  but I think the nose of the trailer hit him.  I got the truck stopped just in time and looked in my mirror to see his head lunge forward  because it was the trailer tires that moved it.  You know, it just about ran over his head with the damn trailer tires. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, it could have made a mess.  Yeah, and then, you know, he was drunk off his butt, which is actually probably what saved  his life, and, you know, he's like, oh, I'm okay, I'm okay, and, you know, I'm sitting  there, what do I do, you know, and I figured there was enough people there, they called the  cops, and I got kind of pulled off the street a little bit, and sure enough, the cop  came and talked to the people out there, and I was waiting for him to come.  Then what happened? 
[00:38:00]  Jesus Christ, all right, you're going to run us through the story you told when you got  home that night?  And then my insurance rates went up a few months later.  Yeah, I got the bill, so I opened the envelope.  Right, right.  Right.  A lot of pedestrians in the city get hit by tractor trailers and buses because they stand  in the road waiting across the street, and the tractor trailers, you know, it's pretty  tight here in Manhattan, so they've got to cut the corners, and the people look and see  the front of the tractor trailer is way out in the intersection, not even close to them.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  But by the time the back end of it gets into the intersection, it's pretty much scraping  on the curb.  So they're standing there not looking, and the rear tires just run them over, and that's  it.  Bye-bye.  A lot of the bike dudes get hit.  Can we get a stat today, A-Rock?  How many pedestrians get killed in New York City by being run over?  Yeah, and I got-  Supposedly it's like well over like one a week.  One a week here in Manhattan.  And let me tell you something.  I don't know what the deal is, but when you're driving down in Chinatown- 
[00:39:00]  Why would you be driving down in Chinatown?  Well, there's people that live down there.  They've got to go see.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big piece of Manhattan.  You've got friends that live down there and stuff.  Sometimes you've got to go to Brooklyn.  It's the fastest way to cross over.  Yeah, you go to Brooklyn Bridge, one police plaza.  It's over there.  But you've got to drive through Chinatown.  And people will walk right out in front of your car.  And you're constantly reading about Asian women, older Asian women getting hit by cars. 
[00:39:30]  Constantly.  They just shuffle out in the middle of the street.  They do not look.  Maybe it's an insurance scam.  No, because they're usually dead.  Oh.  They just get, I mean, wailed.  Maybe they're really team players.  Yeah.  Well, take one for the family.  Could be.  Oh, wow.  This is a hell of a way to start a morning show, by the way, with these horrific stories.  But very interesting.  Let's go to Maine.  It's Andrew.  What's up, Andrew?  Hey, what's up, Owen? 
[00:40:00]  Hey.  Hey.  I pulled up the end of my boss's driveway one day and waiting for traffic to clear on  a major route.  And all of a sudden, screeching tires both ways.  I look and I see this tan thing flying through the air.  What I thought was a deer.  It was a guy wearing a Carhartt suit.  So it looked like a deer.  And of course, his boots.  He came right out of his freaking boots.  And so I called up 911 and said, oh, someone hit a deer. 
[00:40:30]  And then everyone gets out, starts looking.  And I go over and look.  It's a guy.  He jumped right out in front of a truck.  To kill himself?  Yeah, to kill himself.  Oh.  The poor driver of that truck, man, he was all messed up.  So what finally tipped you off that it wasn't a deer?  Was it the orange hat?  Or was it the note that he left behind?  No, I walked over.  I have Lyme disease.  I can't handle it.  Oh, by the way, you don't want to know what it's like to have your foot crushed.  I've lost my toes in an accident. 
[00:41:00]  That is a nice non-sequitur.  Were we taking toe-crushing stories that I didn't know?  You're right, sir.  He's like, you wouldn't want to know what it's like to have your toes crushed.  As if we challenged it to say it's fun.  No, I want to know.  How many did you lose?  Well, I lost all of my big one, half of my second one, and just the top of the third one.  What did you do?  I was wearing steel-toed boots, and I was on a job site.  Someone had disengaged the hydraulics and rigged it up.  So when I stepped out of the Bobcat, the hydraulics didn't disengage. 
[00:41:30]  So when I stepped back in, I got caught, hit a foot pedal, and it brought the bar down over my steel-toed boots.  Oh, oh, oh.  That has got to be painful.  Those nerve endings, man.  That's a nasty one.  At the end of your fingers and your toes.  You had two little loose toes in your shoes?  Just think of a tube of toothpaste.  That's what it did to my big toe.  I thought we didn't want to know. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Remember a little while ago you said you don't want to know?  Do you remember?  Do you remember?  You could have saved us that horrific visual.  Bob, Missouri, what's up?  We're taking a break, but what do you got?  Yeah, hey, man.  I used to drive a big truck on the road, and I had a guy jump off the overpass in front of his windshield and slid under the truck, and I ran over him.  He committed suicide in front of him, splattered him all over the highway.  They had shovels out there shoveling him up.  Man, look, man.  There's people listening to us right now. 
[00:42:30]  There are people listening right now that are going to kill themselves someday.  Yeah.  Leave us out of it.  Yeah, stop already.  Leave us out of it.  Yeah, he was nuts.  Seriously, I know you're nuts, but please leave us out of it.  We don't need that horrific visual in our heads for the rest of our lives.  Don't jump out a window.  Don't stand in front of a train.  Remember the time we were doing afternoons here in New York, and we got word that there was a guy splattered like pizza on the sidewalk?  Yeah, that was in front of the old Harley Davidson. 
[00:43:00]  And we got some pictures of it and everything, and we threw it up on a website back in the day, but it was a big story here.  The guy decides to kill himself, jumps out a window.  I forgot how high up, 15, let's say 15, somewhere between 15 and 20 stories.  Yeah, it was pretty high up.  And the guy, as he falls, is this woman just walking.  It's lunchtime, and the guy brushed.  Just barely brushed her.  Barely brushed her just before he hit the sidewalk, and that's what she has to remember for the rest of her life, how close she was to be killed by this ass. 
[00:43:30]  I love guys that jump naked so their body splats.  There are people that jump naked just so their body goes all over the place.  Sexy.  Yeah.  Just a big naked.  Because, you know, clothes will kind of hold it in a little.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  You're going all over the place.  A little redecorating in the plaza.  I was reading an article on, like, suicide or whatnot, and a lot of these big cities, you know, a lot of these landmarks, the workers at these landmarks have to be fully aware that people will travel to this particular landmark just to kill themselves. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, the most famous one is the Golden Gate Bridge out there in San Francisco.  Yeah, people love that.  People will travel from all over the world to kill themselves by jumping off that bridge.  But that's not the only big landmark or structure that people decide to kill themselves on, you know.  Yeah, people want this connection with things, I guess.  They do it with the bridges here in New York, the Empire State Building.  They attempt it every once in a while.  But for some reason, it's the thing to do, kill yourself at a famous site or landmark.  Did you hear a story about people dumping remains, like when they cremate somebody, in Disney? 
[00:44:30]  What?  Yeah, a woman was caught dumping remains of a loved one in Pirates of the Caribbean in the water.  And apparently, this has been going on for quite some time.  People want to be there?  Yeah, people have been dumping remains of loved ones in various attractions at Disney.  Because, you know, if people really like Disney, they want to kind of sprinkle their ashes there. 
[00:45:00]  What do you got, Sam?  Just being on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and getting a big face full of Uncle Ted.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, just kidding.  Now, hold on.  It's going to be the wildest ride this side of the Pecos.  And you might get ashes in your face.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No flash photography.  I just want to be dumped at Disney.  Little kids vomiting all the time on you.  It's awful.  We're going to stop this, but this guy ran over a hooker.  I mean, come on.  Sean, Jersey, what's up?  Is he playing GTA? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm a police officer, and I was on control on a police motorcycle when a hooker ran across  the highway, going to a truck stop, never even seen her, hit her, broke two femurs,  or hit her back.  I broke my left arm.  Is she okay?  I mean, she lived, finally?  Yeah, she ended up living, yes.  And I still have the rods in my arm.  I heard the hooker.  That's where she has them.  In her face.  Is it true she had to spend the next six months on her back? 
[00:46:00]  In a body cast.  Yeah.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  Jimmy, anything else happen to you on vacation?  Because that killed an hour.  Killed an hour.  Yes, when we get back, I did the Gene Simmons roast, which was much more fun than I thought  it would be.  And I booked New Year's Eve in Long Island, tickets on sale tomorrow at the North Shore  Theater.  New Year's Eve?  New Year's Eve in Long Island.  Is it the North Fork Theater? 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  Oh, you said North Shore.  Whatever.  I don't know.  The old Westbury.  Right.  The old Westbury Music Fair.  Why do they have to change the name and make it confusing for everybody?  I don't know what North Fork is.  Now you drive by the place, it looks like it's just like, it's a big bank.  Where's Westbury Music Fair?  Oh, it's a bank now.  I gotta see a show at a bank.  I just see a logo for a bank.  I'm confused.  Where did the venue go?  But you know what?  You eventually do stop saying that, because now, I used to call, I called Continental  Arena the Meadowlands for years, and now I'll go, yeah, they're over Continental.  It eventually did get to me.  Eventually.  You do start.  Catches on. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  You can't help yourself.  I'm not a fan of naming buildings after, you know, after corporate-like companies, because  it's just, it's just boring sounding.  Men.  It's just boring.  Like, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  They just got cool names for arenas and stuff, and now it's like, it's named after a bank  or something.  It's not the same thing.  But if I owned a place, I'd probably do it.  Well, the money they get for doing it, you know, how could they refuse?  But maybe they could, like, maybe they could take the corporate money and then still make 
[00:47:30]  a cool name somehow.  Yeah.  That's all I'm getting at.  What?  The IZOD Center.  What's that?  It's not Continental anymore.  It's IZOD?  They just changed it.  When did they change it?  Two weeks ago.  Are you kidding me?  This is New Jersey.  This is not the New Year's Eve show.  Why would anyone say I'm going to the IZOD Center?  Are you?  That's...  They lost a lot of their stuff to the new Prudential building that built in Newark, and Continental  just didn't want to do the upkeep anymore, so now it's the IZOD Center.  So now we won't be able to say Continental.  Everyone will still call it Continental. 
[00:48:00]  Let's see, Continental, boring.  Prudential Center, boring.  IZOD Center, boring.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  I'll tell you what is exciting.  North Fork Theater.  Right.  They say at Westbury, just so you kind of know where you are.  Yeah.  The North Fork Theater at Westbury, if it's a resort.  That's where Jimmy's going to be New Year's.  We've got to take a break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  What's up, bitches?  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, before the break, Anthony was saying that people dump their loved ones down there 
[00:48:30]  in Disney, right?  Yeah, in Disney, people have decided, you know, people that enjoy Disney and they pass on,  that they get cremated, and then people dump their ashes in various rides, you know, their  favorite ride.  Yeah.  We got a phone call about that.  It's Mike listening on BCN in Boston.  Mike, what's up, buddy?  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  Hey, listen.  Yeah, I was listening to BCN last week, and Crash from the Toucher and Rich show said that 
[00:49:00]  he dumped his mother on It's a Small World ride.  Really?  That's exactly what we were just talking about.  Yeah, that seems to be a popular ride for people to dump their loved ones in.  That's great.  Can we...  Yes, Mike, go.  Happy phone call Thursday, buddy.  Thanks, man.  Hey, can we get Crash from the Toucher and Rich show on the phone to talk about that?  It's a Small World.  It's a Small World.  It's not sure to be up at this hour.  I know.  What are you kidding? 
[00:49:30]  They're probably still out.  He's going to bed shortly.  I actually got an email from Toucher about his alcoholism.  It's a Small World.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye, Mommy.  Oh, that's a big mommy.  That's the whole urn.  That's a big mommy.  Bye, Mommy.  Wow.  Well, there it goes.  Bye, Mommy.  There you go. 
[00:50:00]  Wasn't there someone else with you on the ride?  No.  Hey, we got to communicate from Toucher and Rich.  They write, hey, guys, just want to thank you for all the plugs on your show over the  last few weeks.  Great stuff, brothers.  We had a great time hanging out with you guys at the Hard Rock on Halloween.  They remember?  I believe Toucher, Crash, and I may have had a few drinks that night, although admittedly  not even on the same planet as the amount we have had at station events in the past.  So they're openly admitting they were lightweights that night? 
[00:50:30]  That they were lightweights when we thought they were completely hammered.  And then they write, I know, Opie, you had said at the end of the night that if we ever  had any funny audio to send it your way, here's some dry audio of a hidden mic bit  I did a while back.  Here's the story in a nutshell, blah, blah, blah.  I'll forward this to Steve.  We'll see if it's something we want to play on our show.  But there you go.  Toucher and Rich thanking us for calling them alcoholics to an entire nation the last month  or so.  Bunch of interesting stories coming in today. 
[00:51:00]  The nine-year-old drug test, dude.  Yeah.  This is a great story, man.  Well, what else are kids for?  You know, they're your kids.  What else are they for?  To help out.  If you want to take a drug test and perhaps you can't stop smoking pot for a few days.  Jesus Christ.  What's wrong with this guy?  Anyway, that's what your kid is for.  Hey, to help you pass a drug test.  You know, it's not criminal.  It's not a criminal thing.  I mean, it's an ethical problem, I would think. 
[00:51:30]  But they arrested the guy on, like, child endangerment.  Wait till you hear the story.  All right, here it is.  Well, Long Island man is behind bars for pulling his son out of school to help him take a drug test.  Police say that they saw 36-year-old Brandon Constantino of Center Reach and his nine-year-old son acting weird in a deli parking lot yesterday.  Now, when they confronted the two, Constantino admitted he made his son urinate in a cup because he needed to pass a drug test for a new job. 
[00:52:00]  He's now facing a child endangerment and possession of marijuana charges.  You think this guy likes drugs, Jimmy?  I don't think he has an affection for drugs.  To make your kid urinate in a jar to protect you, you have to love drugs.  Of course.  That's great.  How is it a child endangerment, though?  Is a kid doing it in a tub with a toaster in his hand?  I know.  He's just filling up a cup.  And by the way, what a dumb father. 
[00:52:30]  How are you going to get away with that?  They're probably going to think, what do you eat, Twinkies and Flintstones chewables?  This is not your urine.  You're not doing drugs, but you have the chicken pox.  And why not go somewhere else to have the kid do this for you?  How about a bathroom?  Yes.  Yeah, he's out in the parking lot somewhere.  The cops probably thought they were onto something that was really bad.  This guy's got the kid on the hood of the car waving at passengers' miles.  Her father holds a little juice bar.  Juice bar.  Juice bar.  Juice bar.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo. 
[00:53:00]  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  This is not set up right today, by the way.  Uh-oh.  Someone's head.  The first time I thought it was me, but it's definitely not set up.  But anyway, I was thinking as I was listening to that story that we could get away with a  lot of crap if we didn't act weird.  Like having your nine-year-old son in a parking lot?  But the reason he got caught was because people saw that this guy was acting weird. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  If you could just stay cool in these situations and not act weird, you would get away with  a lot of stuff in this world.  But people panic and start acting weird, and that makes people call the authorities.  That's true.  I'll give you that one.  Well, just stop acting weird.  Probably no way to do it not weird, though.  Unless you just got to go to the bathroom and say, look, here's what you got to do.  Whatever.  Tell him, make up a reason why you need the kid to do it, and tell him to keep it under  his hat.  Or have him do it before he leaves the house in the morning.  How forgetful was it?  I think he was doing drugs.  He probably overslept.  That's true. 
[00:54:00]  I want it to be a responsible, smart guy, and he's trying to beat a urine test with  a nine-year-old.  This guy has no planning skills at all.  I got a pregnant woman to do it quickly.  What are you doing, stupid?  He's apparently a trucker, I think, and he's going for the test.  Okay.  Hey, the other thing.  It is Perv News Thursday.  There's a great story.  I think it's out of Westchester.  There's an old doctor that died.  Oh, yeah.  And I guess they were going through, like, a storage facility or something?  Yeah, it was a huge storage facility. 
[00:54:30]  All they showed was boxes.  Boxes.  Boxes and boxes.  Child porn.  50,000 35-millimeter slides.  Slides.  And more than 100 8-millimeter movie reels.  Reels.  That doesn't mean movies.  That means movie reels.  It was a hidden storage space.  I guess it was during a renovation project, and it was in his home.  And they set out to find more victims, because this is a guy who once faced child abuse allegations, 
[00:55:00]  and they called his collection staggeringly large.  Staggeringly.  And they said most of these things were made, kids were between 6 and 15 years old,  from the 1960s through the 80s.  Groovy.  So they fired this guy, and they took away his medical license in the 90s, and he died  mercifully.  He's dead.  But they want to find the kids and see if they could contact other people that have copies  of this stuff.  Kids.  That's what I'm saying.  They're in their 50s. 
[00:55:30]  Men and women.  If you're in the 60s making child porn movies, you're like, how old are you now?  You're like my age.  You're either over it and working, or you're screwed up.  You're 45.  I don't think there's any fixing that.  You've never recaptured your film glory.  You probably went on to a normal life after that.  You'd be a big star in the movies.  What a creep, though.  Just picture him in his house with that whoo, the slide projector going, with a beep that  tells you it's time to move on to the next creepy picture. 
[00:56:00]  What was the sound it used to make?  Those stupid slide projects.  Oh, the film strip.  Or the film strip.  There's a film strip.  Beep.  And then you'd have to advance the film strip.  Why didn't he get rid of this crap?  Because he probably didn't.  I don't know what he died of, but he might not have been thinking of it on his deathbed.  Or, you know, again, maybe he figured it out.  And maybe I'll pull through and want to watch these again.  People don't like getting rid of their stuff.  Whatever it is.  Do you need 50,000 35-millimeter slides?  Well, I mean, I'll say it.  Do you need over 100 movie reels? 
[00:56:30]  Maybe you get bored.  I mean, I'll say this.  I have 2,000 songs on my iPod, and I get bored.  Yeah.  You know, yeah.  So, I mean, I'll just say that and play devil's advocate.  2,000.  Maybe more.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  There you go.  I'm the iPod kid.  That's my nickname.  Oh.  Right.  Hey, we got Bretta.  She's a girl in Jersey.  Bretta, what's up?  It's Brita.  Brita.  It's Brita.  Who are you named after?  God damn it.  Brita, who are you named after? 
[00:57:00]  I'm named after St. Bridget of Ireland.  Okay.  All right.  What do you got, Brita?  Yeah, dude.  Dude, you rocked my morning because I couldn't fucking fall asleep because it was driving me  crazy.  Men is like, what?  You, you know, you dropped a bomb.  Yeah.  Starts with the letter F.  Don't get over it.  No, I mean, it starts with the letter F.  Yeah.  You get, what we're...  Oh, sorry, dude.  Sorry, dude.  Sorry, dude.  Wait.  You couldn't sleep last night?  You're a little buzzed.  And you're buzzed.  I drink some coffee.  I'm on a natural high. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  I pissed him a cop yesterday morning.  Excuse my language.  Well, there's two.  And then she goes, excuse my language.  We can't.  We can't.  We can't excuse.  We can't excuse your language.  Come on.  You're like LaMana at the table talking to Tommy.  And now she's just babbling.  Go ahead.  All right.  I didn't mean to try to converse with you.  Sorry.  I just think cut losses immediately.  Really?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Too many people talking.  I know that.  You're the one that's talking.  We were letting you talk.  We were letting you talk. 
[00:58:00]  And you cursed a couple times.  I know.  I have a mouth.  Oh, I hope.  I apologize.  I hope that the family says, I can't believe she went like Jane Mansfield.  I hope that happens.  You know what they do?  They throw me in the hospital because I have a mouth on me.  Oh, what?  So you've been in the hospital before?  Many times.  For what?  Mental problems?  Well, they keep telling me I'm bipolar.  Yeah.  Right.  I study at Montclair.  Yeah.  Listen, though.  I'm a psych major and I study at Montclair State. 
[00:58:30]  I have four classes left until I graduate.  Yeah.  And I ran away to Florida and they came back.  Why did you run away to Florida as an adult?  Who are you, Ratso Rizzo?  No, dude.  I was raised in Clifton.  I was born in Ireland.  I'm not American.  Do you have a MySpace?  Yeah, I do.  What is it?  What is it?  Let's see.  A beautiful Brita.  B-R-E or B-R-A?  B-R-E.  B-R-E-D-A.  All right. 
[00:59:00]  B-R-E-D-A.  Check it out.  E-Rock is pulling that up right now.  Wow, she's cute.  Are you kidding me?  That's me, like, blind.  That's me blind.  There's nothing cute about her.  Absolutely wrong.  Dude, she's a Lisa Loeb thing from this distance.  She's got a Lisa, yeah.  No, are you fat or skinny?  She's using MySpace like...  Fat and skinny had a race.  Hold on!  She's using MySpace voodoo, and I can't accept it.  Oh, the MySpace picture tricks?  This is MySpace voodoo.  Voodoo.  This is not a color photograph. 
[00:59:30]  It's like kind of a black and white photograph.  I think it's hiding up a world of hurts.  Brita, are you pretty?  Hold on.  What, are you a good looking girl?  I'm gorgeous.  But are you fat?  I'm fucking...  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I'm fat anymore.  I was fat because I had a fat...  Excuse me.  Yeah, you gotta watch that.  Are there any other...  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Are there any other pictures on there, Iraq?  No, it's...  Yeah, but you gotta add me.  I'm private.  All right, well, then...  You're private.  Friend requests me because I'm MySpace.com, Jim Norton, and then tomorrow we'll look at 
[01:00:00]  your pictures on the air.  But she looks like...  I can't tell if she's fat.  It's MySpace voodoo.  I'm telling you right now, man.  It is not my...  It is my...  And even the background shot, I shot in New Mexico because it's a lotus blossom.  No, there's something going on.  Nobody cares about...  I'm fucking crazy.  Your picture looks good.  The one picture we can see definitely looks good, but I think it's MySpace voodoo.  Rita!  The angle is such that it's too artsy.  It's an artsy type photo, and she keeps talking.  Will you shut up?  You have to have a give and take. 
[01:00:30]  You talk a little...  I know.  I know.  No, you don't know because you continue.  What...  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You're awful.  Good morning.  You're pretty cute, too.  She's not.  But you're awful.  No, she is.  She's a pretty face.  She's got...  I hate what's coming out of that hole in the front of her face, which is all that sound.  We all know about MySpace voodoo.  I'm saying there's a lot of MySpace voodoo happening.  Yeah, I do, too.  Why don't I just hang up on her?  I don't know.  That's my problem. 
[01:01:00]  I know.  That is my biggest problem.  It's cold.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Why would I just hang up on her?  Cut losses.  She's annoying all of us in the studio.  She's annoying our listeners, but for some reason, I can't hang up on her.  Please don't, because I'm blind right now, sitting in my car, because I'd rather not  be in my house.  She's like Citadel stock.  We should have dumped it a long time ago.  I love a Marine.  Help me find my Craig.  I...  Oh, she just...  Government won't let me touch him.  You are a little bipolar.  There's something wrong with you.  I'm not bipolar. 
[01:01:30]  No, I self-diagnosed myself, and I used to smoke a lot of marijuana, and I think it was  all self-medication, and it kept me sane.  And then after 19, when they started throwing me on pills, they're, like, prescribing me  crack, and that's not cool.  I think they prescribe crack.  I don't think so, but...  I can listen to you talking, and you're so...  Your inability to, like, shut up and listen and then talk is mind-blowing.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  All right. 
[01:02:00]  Well, let's take some bets.  I say...  I'm not going to argue with Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How close are you to 57th Street in Manhattan?  Yeah, I wouldn't think late.  I have to get my eyes dilated, because I'm so fucking blind.  Oh, my God.  We're going to run out of...  I'm sorry.  Please don't hang up on me.  Listen to me.  Yes.  I'm with Jimmy.  The picture looks good, but I'm very suspicious, and I'm going to call it MySpace Voodoo, and 
[01:02:30]  tomorrow we're going to see other pictures of her, and I want to bet somebody in the studio  that this thing is a mess.  She won't.  Go inside...  Shut up.  ...and approve all...  Hold on.  Shh.  She won't.  Go inside and approve all of your friends, because E-Rock had request...  A friend requested you.  You're out.  So just go approve your friends.  All right.  Definitely.  Okay.  Do you get nervous when there's dead air? 
[01:03:00]  Do you get nervous when there's silence or something?  I'm nervous.  I'm nervous.  Do I intimidate me?  Do you get nervous when there's silence?  No.  I like silence.  You don't like silence.  I think everybody would shut up.  I love silence.  You don't, because every time there's a moment of it, you fill it with your blather.  It doesn't even have to be silence.  Right.  Listen to me.  Can I comment?  Yes.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I got a problem.  I don't know why, but I cannot hang up on this chick, so someone get that F over here 
[01:03:30]  and hang up on her.  Desi knows me.  No, no, no.  Don't.  No, don't listen to them.  Take this, because I don't know what's wrong with me.  Just hang up on her.  Yeah, she's babbling.  Thank you.  Oh, thank God.  I don't know why, but for some reason.  What is it calling her back?  Huh?  What's it calling her back?  I heard it ringing.  Now go in there and approve.  Listen, she's probably still talking on the phone.  If you're listening right now, nut, go inside and approve your friend so we can look at you.  Yeah.  We want to see.  Right.  Friend requested you.  All right.  Let's go to Andrew in Jersey. 
[01:04:00]  Andrew.  Hey.  Hi.  What's up, Andrew?  I'm on my bus going to go to school.  Oh, you're going to...  You're on a bus?  You're on a bus going to school?  What grade are you in, son?  I'm in eighth.  Eighth grade?  Yeah.  I wish I was out listening to your radio station because that's all I ever do.  Your voice has that eighth grade sound to it.  That eighth grade coolness.  Yeah.  This kid's cool.  Are you a cool kid or are you a dork in school?  What?  Are you a cool kid or a dork? 
[01:04:30]  No, I'm not a dork.  Not a dork.  I love that all these kids have their own cell phones these days.  It's amazing.  All right.  You're on the bus, right, Andrew?  Yeah.  Any cute girls on the bus right now?  Not right now.  No?  Well, that's fine.  You know what used to happen to me on the bus?  What?  Nah, probably shouldn't say.  Hey, listen.  No, I used to, for some reason, and I don't know why, I would just get on the bus and  I'd get into a state that is normally reserved for encounters with women during some kind 
[01:05:00]  of sexual contact.  You'd throw up and cry?  Yeah.  Wow.  And for some reason, just being on the bus would do that.  And then I'd get off the bus at school, and I'd have to take my books and kind of hold  them in front of me for a little while, and then it would just go away.  But every time on the bus, the wheels on the bus go round and round.  Come on, everybody.  Hey, Andrew.  No?  What row were you in? 
[01:05:30]  Seventh.  Seventh row?  Yeah.  Well, you're in the seventh row on the bus?  Yeah.  Punch the bus driver in the side of the head, and then just turn the wheel into an abutment.  How many rows on the bus, though?  Is it one of those short ones?  About 11.  About 11.  All right.  So you're almost cool.  You're like more cool than nerdy.  You should be in the back seat.  Why aren't you in the back?  Reserved seats.  It's good.  Reserved seats in a bus? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  It's good.  What is that about?  Wait a minute.  What's going on?  When did they start that crap?  I know.  What?  Do they keep the troublemakers up front?  Uh, no, they usually push them towards the back.  Yeah?  Wait, who?  And they sit them next to like a dorky kid.  Wait, who gets the reserved seats, Andrew?  Uh, like the younger kids.  Like a first class?  No, like sixth graders, and they're like really annoying.  Ah, I hate sixth graders, don't you?  They're the worst.  Yeah, they're the sixth graders.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, Andrew, you want to go to an Islanders game?  Linger longer.  Opie will take you to an Islanders game if you wait ten years.  All right, Andrew, why are you calling, by the way?  Yeah, what do you need?  Uh, I don't know, because I'm bored.  I need someone talking.  That assigned seating isn't working out for you?  They didn't put anybody cool next to you?  This radio show does give that personal touch where you feel like, you know what?  I could call them, and they'll just kind of talk.  I need to talk to these guys about nothing.  All right, sir.  Andrew, good luck.  Do you want a song that I'll play for you later? 
[01:07:00]  Uh, sure.  Can you play it like right now by Korn?  There you go.  All right, Andrew.  See, he's cool.  Likes Korn.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Do well in your studies.  Next time you hear that song, it's for you.  Okay, Andrew?  That's how it works.  See?  We can take care of all requests.  Just request a song and how we do it.  Next time you hear that song, just remember it was for you.  By the way, there's a hater out there that hated the fact that I said MySpace voodoo.  Yeah.  Over and over again during that phone call.  Also, for the rest of the show, if you're calling the Opie and Anthony program, please say MySpace voodoo. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, Christ.  I'm a pony.  MySpace voodoo.  MySpace voodoo.  MySpace voodoo.  MySpace voodoo.  Over and over and over again.  Hey, we got Crash from Touchman Rich standing by.  Wow.  He's out dumping his ashes, his mom's ashes down there in Disney.  We'll talk to him next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How many did I take?  Three?  Are you taking drugs?  No.  What are you doing? 
[01:08:00]  I don't know.  I see you opening a bottle.  You're popping pills.  What are you taking?  Uppers, downers?  Benny's, Dexys, meth?  What is that?  B12 commercial.  Or like Adam 12 or something.  Or Dragnet.  Some crappy show.  I don't even list pills.  It's like an always an old show.  Uppers, downers?  What are you taking?  Black beauties?  Yellow jackets?  Reds?  Yellow jackets?  Old bad cop shows.  They list all the drugs.  What are you on?  Dope?  Taking marijuana?  Black beauties? 
[01:08:30]  Uppers, downers?  Lefts, rights?  He's taking the bennies.  Just a B12 pill there.  I don't do the pills.  B12?  You just did.  It's B12.  It's a vitamin.  You said, I just took a B12.  I don't do the pills.  It's a vitamin.  But it's a pill.  It's a vitamin.  There's pills and then there's vitamins.  There's nothing wrong with vitamins, but it's about vitamins.  Vitamins.  Chrisco from Grand Rapids.  He writes, hey, MySpace Voodoo.  Let's make it number one on Google Trends.  MySpace Voodoo. 
[01:09:00]  Everyone understands that.  Hold on.  Let's go to Chris and Monroe.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, man.  What's up?  MySpace Voodoo.  Yeah.  Horrible.  All right.  These girls, they're geniuses when it comes to photography, especially the ones that are  a little bit fat, but they kind of play it off like they're skinny.  Yeah.  I met up with this one girl, right?  Meet her off of MySpace.  I can't really tell what her body is.  Like, it looks all right, but it's not great.  Turns out she's like 170 pounds, dude, right? 
[01:09:30]  Absolutely disgusting.  So, anyway, long story short, we wind up, you know, whatever.  We're done.  So, she goes, hey, are you ever going to call me again?  And I just laughed and walked her to the door.  That's what you have to do.  What a nice, what a gentleman.  But you could cover up a world of hurt with your MySpace photos.  That's all we're getting at.  My favorite is just the eye pictures.  The eye picture?  Just the eye.  Yeah.  When there's a picture of them from eight miles away, like it was taken with the Hubble, 
[01:10:00]  or when there's a photo of them and one of their hot friends,  and you're looking at the two of them, and you're like,  well, I wouldn't be the fat one if I were you.  Hopefully, you're the hot one.  Yeah.  Like, you don't put a picture.  If you're a fatso, don't put a picture of you and your hot friend in the MySpace.  Yeah, because you're going to think, oh, is that the, oh, no.  Unless your name is MySpace.com slash disappoint,  because that's what you're doing to people who contact you.  Let's continue with this MySpace voodoo.  Other things that women do to make their pictures look good online. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, just the eyes.  They do the eye picture.  They do the picture from above.  They do a black and white photo.  Here's a great one.  They have pictures of when they are all tan and nice on vacation with their girlfriends.  Yeah.  Everyone looks way better when they go on vacation, right?  You look relaxed.  A couple of years ago, maybe, too.  You got a few drinks in you.  You're all tanned up.  You're wearing nicer clothes.  And all of a sudden, you throw that up there like that's how you live every day.  Yeah.  That's another little MySpace voodoo trick. 
[01:11:00]  Or they're standing there waving in front of a Rocky II movie poster.  It's not recent.  Mike in Rhode Island is going to add to this.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I just want to say fat chicks are masters at MySpace voodoo.  Like, they hide their chins and armpit cleavage and all that shit.  Why?  The cursing today.  Today is like, wow.  People are really just blowing it out.  Hey, if it...  You know what?  As soon as you curse, let me just explain something to the people out there.  Because I know the listeners want to be stars in their own right. 
[01:11:30]  As soon as you curse on this side of the radio show, your audience goes down by 50% easy, if not more.  Yeah.  So why wouldn't you want to, like, try to keep it clean so you get more people hearing what you're trying to say on a radio show?  Yeah.  Because the technology isn't there to just nip out the curse word.  We lose all of your funny line.  They lop.  When we hit the dump button, it's a lop.  Oh, they're hacking.  It's anywhere from four to eight seconds.  So you think one little curse, they could, like, just dissect that out.  No.  We're lopping heads off. 
[01:12:00]  Let's say it's like the Jane Mansfield thing.  Let's say Jane went in for a...  She said, take a little off the top.  And they're all right.  And they just swung mid-chest.  That's what the duck does.  I got to back up.  Crisco from Grand Rapids.  She's screaming at me.  She's a girl.  I don't know.  How am I supposed to know Crisco is a girl's name?  All right.  We lost it.  We have our friend...  Yeah, let's say hi to Crash from Toucher and Rich.  Yes.  Hey, Crash.  What's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  How are you, sir?  Can't complain. 
[01:12:30]  How are the guys?  Doing pretty good.  If I sound a little tired, I apologize.  Fred just dropped me off about a half hour ago.  We were out all night.  Of course you were.  Where were you?  No, I'm just kidding.  Actually, you know what?  In Fred's defense, and this is not just because I've known him for 10 years,  he's really not the station's biggest drunk.  Yeah, I'm hearing that you're kind of mad that we've decided to tell her when that,  you know, Toucher's a raging alcoholic when, in fact, you're the raging alcoholic.  Is that true? 
[01:13:00]  I'm kind of pissed because 20 years in radio in Atlanta, I built my entire career on being  fired four times, being the drunk, screwing all the women, and I come up here and I'm  like, okay, let's just carry it on, and I've lost my title.  They think you like, they look at you like the stable one, the goody two-shoes?  Yeah.  I wouldn't exactly go that far, but I promise you, Fred's just a natural-born prick.  You put a few drinks in him, and he gets that stare, he gets that dumb look, and he looks 
[01:13:30]  like he's really wasted.  When he's not, he's just ignoring him as far as he would.  Yeah, I'm glad you said it, because that's exactly what I was thinking when I saw that.  He was kind of staring off into space.  Is he the one that, which one, is he the one that wore the slippers the day I saw him?  He looked like, he looked like that old guy in Arthur, he looked like Liza Minnelli's  father, but skinnier.  That's really good.  That's who he looks like.  Just picture a skinny version of that guy, unshaven and a mess, doing a good radio show.  He grows a five o'clock shadow by the end of his shift up there in Boston. 
[01:14:00]  Well, I'll have you know, it's all because of what you guys said, that he is not only dressing  better now, he's now got a personal trainer, he's in the gym, you've completely screwed  the man, he's just, he's a totally different person now.  Right.  We might have helped him.  No, no, no, I seriously doubt that, but, you know, he's a, in fact, that's why we're  doing, we're doing a contest right now, we're doing a thing called the F and Champ.  It's a drinking game where we all were seated one through six, and we're going up against 
[01:14:30]  each other, so we'll find out who the champ is, although we do have a 350 pound Mexican  guy on our, on our show that can just, who's, who's the number one seed?  Uh, actually that was him, his name's Adolfo, and there's just absolutely no, well, the  kid's like 22 years old, he never drank before, and he's so uneducated that he drinks like  a fifth of Jack Daniels, he's like, oh wow, now what happens?  Wait.  It's too stupid to realize he's drunk?  Is he the guy that when I was in studio, he's all the way against the wall, kind of?  Like, he doesn't talk much? 
[01:15:00]  No, no, he doesn't say a word unless spoken to, and even then you have no idea what he's saying,  but the reason he was in a corner, because we make him go in a corner when he has flatulence.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah, he's a creep, I saw that guy.  Yeah, something tells me it probably would, would wreak the whole room out.  Hey Crash, what's the deal with you dumping the ashes of what, your mom?  Yeah, it was my mom, because we grew up in Miami, so, you know, it was always like grab  the kids and do a little trip to Disney World, so we spent just about two, three times a year  in Disney World, so, you know, it became a big family tradition for us, and then on a real 
[01:15:30]  happy note, after mom got her cancer, we took her there one last time, and she said, you  know, hey, this is where I want to be, but she also loved to fish, so we put half her  ashes in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida Keys, and the other half, we went back to  It's a Small World and dumped a can of the rest of her ashes off the side.  You know, that's, uh, that's, uh, too much responsibility.  What if we're supposed to have our ashes in one place when we die?  You know what? 
[01:16:00]  You might have messed up her whole, like, life in eternity.  Yeah.  She's not able to cross over, because she's half in the Atlantic, and the other half listening  to It's a Small World.  Right.  That's what I'm getting at.  And dude, how do you know what parts get dumped where?  Like, you may have in one place put, like, the ankle and the scalp, and in the Atlantic,  her nose and her ass floating right next to each other.  Right.  And there's been all these sightings that just hold, like, a cigarette.  Her arm just holds up, like, a caliber.  It comes out of It's a Small World. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, when my dad died, he wanted some of his stuff donated to science, and then, now  that it's been about three years, I'm like, man, did we do the right thing?  Was he supposed to be, like, whole?  Yeah, you don't know.  You don't know.  I mean, you know.  What if you're in the afterlife and going, oh, I knew I should have just.  You just left it all alone in one piece.  I'm in the afterlife getting no dates because my stupid family thought it was a good idea  to give a few parts to science.  Yeah.  How am I going to get dates with no eyes and no whatever? 
[01:17:00]  I would imagine that that was all over with once she was finished being cremated.  If there was any chance of her going to heaven as a whole, that was done after they cooked her.  Yeah.  Good point.  So it's a small world, huh?  Yeah.  Anthony was saying that people in America are getting so fat that they have to, what,  dig out the ride now?  They have to dig out the ride, yeah.  Apparently, there's a turn in there that is getting bogged down, and the boats are stopping,  and they actually had to build a platform for employees to come out and push the boat because 
[01:17:30]  people are getting so fat in this country.  I'm thinking it's because of people like Crash dumping the ashes of loved ones.  I think it's just dead people ashes that are...  It's like a mud pit.  It's like a sandbar.  Like a sandbar of dead relatives.  That's people running over the ass of my mom that's up there.  I love it.  Crash.  That's one of her arms reaching up saying, get that son of a bitch, get him out of the boat.  That's a novel idea.  I mean, I've heard about it, and apparently a lot of people do it. 
[01:18:00]  A woman got caught dumping a loved one into the Pirates of the Caribbean last week.  Yeah, I think the Haunted Mansion's like getting a lot of people doing that.  Yeah, yeah, the Haunted Mansion's another one.  But not any water in there, so that just kind of lays around.  Yeah, you wind up on the floor, and then Pedro comes in and sweeps you up.  Yeah, sweeps you up afterwards, throws you in the garbage pile.  Hey, I want to change subjects for a second, Crash.  I'm hearing that Rich from Touching Rich was one of the first internet celebrities.  Is that true?  The first internet for what? 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  Let me go to Pez in Atlanta.  Pez?  Yes?  You're on with Crash from Touching Rich.  Hey, Crash.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, yeah, Rich was one of the first internet pictures to be passed around.  Do you remember when he was protesting out in Augusta?  Oh, okay.  I didn't know that was big on the sports center and stuff,  but I didn't know that was one of the first things on the internet.  No, that was everywhere.  For you guys, for ONA, the picture is, there's a bunch of women at Augusta protesting, 
[01:19:00]  and he's the one in the background holding up a sign that says,  Iron My Shirt, Bitch.  All right.  All right, that's an old story when the women were trying to get into Augusta,  so they could play along with the men, right?  Yeah, he was a stunt boy, actually, in Atlanta.  They put him up to that. 
[01:19:30]  Spuds Buckley?  Hey, hey.  No?  Hey, hey, hey.  I thought his name might have been Spuds Buckley.  Hey, hey.  I wish I did something like that as Spuds Buckley.  That's great.  We've got to get the picture up on onaradio.com later today.  Very cool.  Yeah, it was all over again.  Iron My Shirt, Bitch.  All right, guys.  Pez, thanks.  And Atlanta Crash, thank you so much.  No problem, guys.  Oh, there it is.  Look, Iron My Shirt, Bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, there he is.  I recognize him.  That's funny.  Wait, is that really him?  Yes.  That picture?  Is that dumbbell?  Why, you've seen that picture? 
[01:20:00]  No, a hundred times I've seen this.  Fuck out.  Wow.  What was that?  That's Rich from Toucher and Rich.  That's Rich?  Yes.  Oh, that is.  I totally recognize him now.  Iron My Shirt, Bitch.  I've never seen this picture.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, the man's got a cast iron sack.  I mean, he was there screaming when Martha Burke was trying to talk and everything.  You could hear there's audio that goes with it and everything.  The cops are escorting him out and everything.  I mean, it's great.  Hey, that's a great bit right there.  Yeah, it was when the women were trying to play alongside the men at Augusta. 
[01:20:30]  Look at these women.  None of them even know how to play golf.  Iron My Shirt.  It says Iron My Shirt.  Right along.  Right along signs that say sexism is a handicap.  College, $80,000.  Dignity, respect.  $124,000.  Busting up the old boys club priceless.  Oh, boy.  And then a big Iron My Shirt, Bitch sign.  It's a big yellow sign.  And it couldn't be more obnoxious.  That sign is so great.  I thought it was fake for years. 
[01:21:00]  I'm like, that's not a real.  No one really did that.  Wow.  That is great.  And that's Rich from Touching Rich.  Bravo, man.  I was so against that whole thing, too, man.  Why do the women want to play alongside the guys?  Anything we enjoy, they have to ruin.  Go open your own club.  Exactly.  And call it Hens.  The Hens Golf Club.  And you can cluck at each other from hole to hole.  How about that?  The Hens playing golf.  And what you can do is instead of a golf cart, you can have a portable laundry line and then 
[01:21:30]  talk to each other over it.  Did you hear what he said?  You don't see guys trying to join women's clubs.  No, you don't want to.  That's why I'm so against this crap.  If you want to play golf, open up your own club.  Leave a little separation here and there.  You don't have the guys running to join women's clubs.  What they'll do is they'll join.  And if they join and just assimilate to the way it is, that's fine.  But then they'll start complaining that it's too sexist and the guys want strippers.  And it's like, you know what? 
[01:22:00]  You're not fun.  Hey, you got pictures of the girl now?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, hold on.  We're going to go back.  Let's say goodbye to Crash.  Take care, man.  Hey, Crash.  And one second.  I told you, by the way.  Crash.  Yeah, man.  Did Dave ever forgive us up there?  You know what?  To be honest with you, I haven't spoken to Dave since he effed up my Thanksgiving.  So I really wouldn't know.  Oh, you're mad?  Yeah.  What happened?  You weren't allowed to go home for Thanksgiving?  Yeah, my wife made the reservations and she had us leaving on Wednesday. 
[01:22:30]  And, you know, we're in the big ratings period.  So no one's allowed to take a day off.  So it kind of screwed things up.  She had to fly in Wednesday and I flew in Thursday.  When I fly in alone, I get drunk.  So I showed up in Atlanta with her family drunk on Thursday.  Yeah.  And stayed drunk all the way through Sunday.  So I blame him for putting the ball in motion.  There you go.  Yeah, our Tom Brady thing caused a bit of a stink up there.  We were just trying to have fun.  I'm all for the Pats going undefeated this season.  I'm not.  You don't want the Pats to go undefeated?  Why, Jimmy?  Oh, your Cowboys are 10-1. 
[01:23:00]  You got a big game tonight.  Yes.  Dallas against the Green Bay Packers.  Both 10-1.  Are they 10-1, the Packers?  Yes.  Farb stinks.  You know what?  And Farb is going to retire.  He's a queer.  Farb can die as far as I'm going to say.  They haven't won in Dallas since 1989.  What, the Packers?  The Packers?  The Green Bay Farb has not won in Dallas since 1989.  He can shut his face and put his stupid fingers up in the air.  Is that bastard really 10-1?  I haven't been following.  Isn't that amazing?  And he was going to retire.  I mean, the team was kind of like, kind of just there for a couple of years. 
[01:23:30]  And he decides, I'm not going to retire.  And now they're 10-1, having one of their best seasons in a long time.  Hey, Crash, say hi to Toucher.  Say hi to Rich.  You guys are, you know, the kings of afternoons up there.  Continued success for you guys.  Thanks, man.  We appreciate everything.  You guys take care.  All right.  For everybody in the Boston area, Touching Rich on BCN in the afternoons.  Hey, wait.  Before we say it, do we have this girl on the line now?  Yeah, let's get her on the line.  Because, I mean, the pictures are up.  Hey.  I can't really get a look from here.  I'll have to walk over there. 
[01:24:00]  Go to the second row, third picture in.  Proves my point.  That.  That.  I can't see from back here.  That is not a beauty.  I can't see, god damn it.  All right, listen.  Let's set this up.  So we got Bretta, Brita, Brita, whatever the hell her name is.  She called back and then she hung up because she has the worst attention span.  So I guess she had to go chain smoke again or something.  She's eating bugs in the corner like she's in Papillon.  Right.  And all the people that are on hold because they want to talk about MySpace voodoo, please  stay there.  Also, E-Rock found that website where they show what these girls do to make themselves 
[01:24:30]  look hot on MySpace.  There's a million great.  Website dedicated to that.  A million great examples.  Yeah.  And we'll do that next as well.  Okay?  And can I just say New Year's Eve tickets for Long Island, North Fork Theater go on sale  tomorrow morning, 9 a.m. at Ticketmaster.  I'm finally coming back to Long Island for a New Year's Eve show this year.  It's an 8 o'clock show so you can get completely loaded after it.  There you go.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show as Opie is sipping water and he's talking 
[01:25:00]  about alcohol.  Colin Quinn just walked in and I'm now leading the show and here it is.  We're back.  You're leaving the show.  Leading.  Like leading us back from break.  I know.  And it was pretty powerful the way I did that.  It really was.  And by the way, I was informed that while I didn't know Colin was here while I was  doing my brilliant sports analysis break about Green Bay in Dallas and apparently  Colin was in the dressing room not agreeing.  Well, it wasn't that I disagreed.  First of all, I grew up loving the Packers. 
[01:25:30]  You know, I was from New York.  But second of all, just the fact that it takes a real amateur to go to spout a fact like  Dallas, Green Bay hasn't beaten them since 1989.  It's not a fact that a real sports fan would even know.  And I'm not even a real sports fan.  I'm a half a fruit myself.  But I know phoniness when I hear it.  How would you know that unless somebody handed you a paper?  No one handed it.  Are you a big sports fan?  Do you watch football every Sunday?  I saw that.  I used to watch it.  And the Cowboys stink and so do the Packers.  And I'm a Packers fan.  They're both 10 and 1.  They're both 10 and 1.  They're both 10 and 1, Godwin.  Against garbage.  The Jets stink. 
[01:26:00]  I know the Jets stink.  You can pick a team that actually stinks.  I like Eli Manning and I'll tell you why.  Because when he throws eight interceptions or four touchdowns, he has the same attitude  after the game.  It's so true.  He's like, hey dude, you know, what are you going to do, right?  And the fans are like, who can you?  He's like, what are you going to do?  I'm Peyton's brother.  That's exactly it.  Now what?  Now what he got for me.  He's so right.  How about some emotion out there?  Even each play, he just stands there like, hey, what's up, man?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's so funny.  I hate Eli.  I hate the Giants.  Can't stand the Giants. 
[01:26:30]  Never liked the Giants.  You know, I always hated the Giants, but with Eli ever so much, they were always boring.  Even when they won the Super Bowl, they were so boring.  Phil Simms, he was just a...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They hit the sand.  When I was a kid, Joe Pasachek was the quarterback.  He was just showing a loser.  Pasachek.  Did they wear helmets back then?  It was just leather.  Yeah, leather helmets.  No face cards.  No face cards.  It was that Joe Pasachek.  Just to show a loser that whether it was in the magazines, they would have The Shy Man's  Guide to Picking Up Girls with Joe Pasachek.  He was the quarterback of the Giants.  I swear to God. 
[01:27:00]  That's like Norton's nonsense in Steppin' Out magazine.  Yeah.  You have your own column in Steppin' Out?  No, no, no.  It's like the Jackie the Joke Man joke.  They put your face in your name.  Oh, I did see that.  They pick an awful joke.  And they just, yeah, pick a joke.  You have nothing to do with it.  No, no.  He only picks you a joke and totally misquotes it.  Oh, yeah.  It screws us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, you check out MySpace broads there, Colin?  No.  No.  My MySpace is a national disgrace.  Is it really?  My brother's supposed to be running it.  Kids come up to me on the road.  Which would you MySpace? 
[01:27:30]  And he'd scream at me.  I have like less friends.  It's unbelievable.  Can we see?  You have like eight friends?  Yeah.  I have less friends than Keith Robinson.  That's not good.  Well, we got into this discussion that a lot of girls on MySpace, they look really hot.  Right.  And then you meet them.  We got a bunch of guys that have met some of these girls on MySpace, and they're just  awful.  They don't look anything like their pictures whatsoever.  So we're talking about like MySpace voodoo.  Some of the things like girls do to make themselves look hot.  And there's a whole website dedicated to girls that look hot on their MySpace pages. 
[01:28:00]  But then the reality is that they're just hiding up a world of hurt.  And they were able to do that, by the way.  They tricked a lot of people.  So they have their MySpace picture, and then they have a real picture of them just kind  of hanging out.  Right.  Literally hanging out all over the place.  Yeah.  A picture that they decide not to have on their MySpace page.  Yeah.  And it's quite different.  You want to like scroll down and show some of these to Carl in there?  Well, let me ask you something.  Not to immediately attack, but how is that any different than Robert Kelly Live?  MySpace. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, how Bob would...  In person, he's like, 480.  Is he using his old publicity shots?  When he had hair and abs?  He just called me from the airport.  Dude, I just got in a fight with a Hindu.  Some Indian guy behind him on the line at the airport is kicking him with his leg with  some bag, and Bob turned around and almost hit him.  He's got to stop playing that video game.  And the Hindu is probably worshipping him.  That's a cow joke, people.  Oh, that's very funny. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, let's go to Casey in Nevada.  Casey, let's get this going.  What do you got?  What's going on?  Hey, Casey.  I got a girlfriend.  She's not really a looker, but on one of her MySpace pictures, she's pretty cute.  She's not a looker.  What does she do to make herself look cute if she's not a looker in person?  Well, Casey, she's on a boat, and I took a picture of her.  She's on a boat.  She's on a boat.  Take a picture.  She's biting Robert Shaw in half. 
[01:29:30]  All right, well, your phone's crapping on.  Maybe you can call us back.  Let's go to Baltimore.  Let's drink to your girl.  Yeah.  What's up, bu-bu-bu-bu-boy?  Hey, Casey in Baltimore.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  I met a chick off MySpace.  Should I not give her name out?  Nah.  Nah, I'll give her name.  No name.  Never mind.  All right.  She was cute.  A little bit, not dumpy, but, you know, that sort of cute chubby.  Yeah.  Okay.  And she had stealth boobs, which, you know, if you have ever experienced this. 
[01:30:00]  No.  No.  It's where the bra makes the boob instead of the boob making the bra.  Wait, the bra makes the boob instead of the boob making the bra.  Gotcha.  Exactly.  So she's cute and everything, and we get a little amorous, and when she takes her clothes off,  I swear to God, she looked like Patty.  See?  Well, Patty's a mess.  Oh.  Yeah.  You got a little amorous?  Yeah, you can't talk that way on regular radio.  I know, sir.  That's a little, that might get dumped out of.  Yeah, that's a little crazy.  We don't want any FCC fines or anything. 
[01:30:30]  A little amorous.  All right.  Colin's MySpace page is a national disgrace.  Terrible.  It is horrible.  First, there's the picture of him and Jerry Seinfeld.  Where?  That is up here in the upper left-hand corner.  Oh, Barry.  Are you friends with Jerry?  That's like his picture.  I know you are.  And by the way, this is what, here's, this is MySpace comedy, Colin Quinn, and then it  says stand-up slash as seen on TV.  Yeah, what is this?  You're an awful product.  They're still on WPIX. 
[01:31:00]  You're a flow bee.  Oh, my God.  Colin was made by Ron Popeil.  And there's a picture of him and Jerry, which kind of annoys me because it's so much better  than my picture with Jerry, which is me on the steps and him standing above me at the  comedy cellar.  You know how I feel about all your celebrity pictures.  They're fantastic.  I'm praying a celebrity kills you.  Why?  Because I hate it.  Why?  I had fun.  I told you a long time ago.  We have a lot to discuss today about your attitude.  And I'm going to start as soon as I feel the time. 
[01:31:30]  By the way, and now with the rest, here's what Colin's page is.  It's a picture of Colin on stage.  His hair is kind of a mess.  He's like got his, it's a typical Colin Paul.  He's kind of standing there just with the mic in front of him and his hands in his pockets  kind of laid back.  But it's the same picture, one on top of the other.  It's a tightly tiled background, which means instead of just having you on stage at a joint  in Las Vegas, it's 800 pictures of him next to the same picture. 
[01:32:00]  It's tiled.  Yeah.  I don't think my brother put this up.  I don't know what this is.  I honestly.  This is your MySpace profile.  It is.  It's your MySpace.  I got to do something.  It is.  This isn't a fan site.  This was made by you or somebody very close to you.  And by the way, the way the dates are, there's no clips of Colin that I can see.  It's like you click on it, right?  I have no CDs.  I'm a wreck.  A bunch of dates.  It's the end.  Colin's at Gotham.  What are you?  At Gotham tonight through Sunday in New York? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  He's here in New York at Gotham Comedy Club.  Oh, he really is commanding the show.  He throws in the plugs organically as he crashes you.  Oh, Michael.  Organically as he crashes you.  He's a pro.  All right.  I mean, but it's just listed.  Hey, Jim, I'll say the joke that you thought was funny from 12 to 14 and so did I.  Hey, you're a real prophylactic.  Let's go to Arizona.  Matt, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Matt.  Yeah, I dated a girl.  She had those MySpace voodoo pictures. 
[01:33:00]  She was disgusting.  She looked like a little 12-year-old Mexican boy when I met her.  What was good about her picture then?  What's the downside?  Well, she had a cute face.  Exactly.  She had a little bit of hair on her chin, too, which was really good.  I once actually slept with a goatee years ago.  Well, what did she do?  Horrendous.  But the point is, what did she do on our MySpace picture that attracted you, and how did she hide all this crap? 
[01:33:30]  She had a vagina.  That's what attracted him.  All right.  Thanks.  Let's get a...  Yeah.  Let's get a pee in Jersey.  Fair enough.  I had a vagina.  Pete.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up?  Hey, let's do this one.  You go to meet the chick called MySpace, and she puts a picture of herself from, like, 10 years earlier.  Then you go to meet her at the bar, and she looks all of the 45 that she really is.  Yeah, they do that all the time.  It's an older...  Yeah, look at other stuff in the picture. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Like, if you're getting out of a car that was in Freebie and the Bean.  You should probably...  Freebie and the Bean.  Don't you joke like that.  We make that movie and ruin it, too.  I can just imagine.  Let's go to Mike in Pittsburgh.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Go to that website, Iraq.  What's up, Mike?  I've been burned a few times.  I checked out a few girls who look totally smoking hot, but their photos are cropped out.  Their faces are, like, locked out. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  There's, like, a mare shot, and then you go up, and you meet them, and their face is  just, like, divots.  That's disgusting.  Hey, is that a real picture on that website, Iraq?  That one, I'm not sure.  Oh, come on.  I think it is.  I'm starting to think it's a real picture.  Oh, it is a real picture.  That girl's gigantic.  She may have had...  There's a picture of a girl laying on an orange blanket, and she looks like she's probably  500 pounds, and she's propped up on her arm with her breasts kind of, like, at a sexy  little top, and, like, the middle of her looks good. 
[01:35:00]  Like, her face and her cleavage looks good.  The rest of her, she looks like just a sea animal.  So, yeah.  If you show just the face and the breasts, she looks like she could be a skinny girl.  I believe they would call that the MySpace iceberg.  Yes.  Yes.  That's, like, 90% of it you can't see, and it's the most dangerous part.  Yeah, it's cropped to the point where you see her cute face and her cleavage, and she  looks like an average, a regular-looking girl.  A human being.  Sure.  A human being.  And then you realize that what she's not showing is a really, really, really large body. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, she should have Carrie Fisher on a chain.  Right.  What are some of the other ones?  What is his website, by the way?  We'll link it up.  All right, we'll link it up.  I heard Chris Hansen is doing a Catch a Predator with those girls, where he brings them, and  he goes, what's wrong with you?  He goes, sit down.  What are you doing here?  Yeah.  I'll be right back.  Look at you, you fat pig.  And they don't even answer, they just go right for the cookies, they don't even use  their hands, they go their mouth in the bowl.  It's worth it when they try to run out and the cops throw them on the ground because they're  so fat it looks hilarious. 
[01:36:00]  All right, go to the other one.  So then they talk about the MySpace angle, where the girl figures out what angle makes  her look good, usually like a profile shot, and they're showing an example of this girl.  She looks really, really hot in her profile.  It's a side shot, she's looking to the left.  Yeah, and then there's another picture of her, which is more from her breasts up, and  you can tell that she's pretty large and should be playing for a football team.  She's an elephant.  Yeah.  And what they do is they use the hair to loop under and cover their neck.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, so you don't see the neck fat.  Right.  All right.  What's the next one?  That's a good move.  Here's something that happens on MySpace.  It's invented by Steve Miller.  Yeah.  This is the very large glasses to hide a fat face.  Yeah.  They're showing a picture of a girl.  She's got the very large kind of like Paris Hilton sunglasses on.  The old guy that just got cataract surgery glasses on.  But the stylish version.  Yeah.  She looks like she could be a cute blonde, right?  And then you take the glasses off, and it shows how fat her cheeks are. 
[01:37:00]  Mm-hmm.  And it's a much different looking girl.  They all wind up looking like field hockey players.  Yeah.  They really do.  The Asian one's not that bad.  But this girl, she sucks in her cheekbones.  Yep.  So she has really nice cheekbones.  The picture is kind of from above a little bit, and it's a side shot.  Hair is strategically placed.  Right.  And she's sucking in the cheekbones.  You see nothing but cheekbones.  This girl looks like Corny Wilson. 
[01:37:30]  Well, yes.  Was it Corny Wilson?  Yeah.  The fat one?  Yeah.  She actually looks like Corny Wilson when she's not sucking in the cheekbones.  The angle you're seeing is picture like she's a little bit below you, and you're to her  left.  So she's probably holding the camera with her left arm and taking the picture from above.  Of course she has no friends.  She shouldn't.  She shouldn't take herself.  And she has her right hand up like, stop.  Like she's holding her right hand up like she's doing some sassy pose.  Sassy. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  What's the next one?  What a manatee.  Oh, yeah.  This one is really classic.  This is a risky move.  Very talented, this girl.  She's wearing nothing, but it looks like a bra and panties.  Yeah, little boy shorts, right?  Little boy shorts and a bra.  Or a very short skirt.  It's hard to tell because that's how much she's messing with the angle.  This is also what I call the underwater shot because it looks like it's underwater.  The flash really lights up the face, but the body and stuff is left in this darkness. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  Like a great white coming at the cage.  It's like.  Oh, very good.  Because it's coming out of the murkiness at you.  She's leaning over now and hiding 90% of her body.  Because from the top angle, you can see the breasts in the outfit and the skirt.  And her face is right there in the picture.  And like Anne said, because she's leaning her face forward.  Her face is right in the picture.  The fatness is way behind her, so it looks thinner.  The other problem, the other thing she's doing to kind of trick you here is using that artsy like black and white. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, because she knows in color she looks awful.  And then the next picture is her during the day outside, color photo.  It looks like she's in front of the Alamo or something.  Sucker mom.  And she is.  She's dumpy.  She's nowhere close.  She's a dumpy girl.  She's nowhere close to that other picture with the short, short skirt.  You couldn't even.  If you put those pictures with like five other pictures, you would never, ever pick her as the same girl. 
[01:39:30]  Like I'd let her service me in the car and then I'd kick her out.  Like she's not atrocious, but she's a dumpy girl.  Dumpy.  If you were meeting the other picture, it's the same girl.  You would take her out to dinner and.  No, you wouldn't.  You'd have a service in the car and kick her out.  Absolutely.  Well, because he's not a real human being, but the average guy would take her to dinner.  If the girl on top showed up, I would at least talk to her before I took it out.  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  The girl on the bottom would literally walk in my door and as she was sitting on the sofa, she'd hear this.  Zip.  Wait, no, I thought that would be like buckle sound.  Now the buckle sound didn't really work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very well.  You need a Foley engineer.  You're a little rusty since you're enema on stage.  Closer days.  We're going to props.  Oh, you know when I would hold the fleet enema?  Yeah.  What's the next one here, Rob?  Prop back.  Did it ever occur to you guys that these pictures say more about us and what we're values are than the ladies? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, but we don't like thinking about that.  We feel better about ourselves by making other people feel bad, Colin.  Now, you know.  Oh, do I ever?  This next picture is a girl.  Same thing, kind of that artsy, not black and white, but one shade of color.  You can tell she's kind of a chubby girl, but she's way overexposed.  Her face looks smooth, like there's not a blemish on it, because like Ann said, it's overexposed. 
[01:41:00]  One shade.  That face isn't bad.  And then the bottom, Rocky Dennis.  Right.  She's got Rocky Dennis.  It says at the bottom, picture taken by local eerie fag hag.  Friend, high school friend and fag hag.  The other important thing to point out with the good picture of the two, she doesn't have her mouth open.  She's smiling and covering her teeth, and we find out why.  She has horrific teeth. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, there's a problem there.  She usually wears glasses and awful glasses, and she has all sorts of acne on her face.  It's like rosacea.  It's like Jim Garrison.  He goes, he's like Jim Garrison in the Kennedy Center.  Yes, Jim.  She doesn't open her mouth, and then in this picture, we find out why she's got awful teeth.  That's right.  This country was founded.  Remember, you're a dying orthodontist.  She has gigantic gums. 
[01:42:00]  If you look at her teeth and gums, there should always be more tooth, but it looks like a pink and white, even separation.  Her gums are the same size as her teeth.  There's way too much gums.  Let's say hi to Tara.  She's from New York.  Tara, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Your girls do this all the time.  I love you guys.  Yeah, cool.  Thanks, Tara.  I have friends that are addicted to MySpace and actually convinced me to get mine after years.  And this one girl that I know is a large girl. 
[01:42:30]  Is she a large person?  She's a great, big, fat person.  She's big through the hips.  Roomie.  Roomie.  Roomie.  Yeah.  We're all pretty big.  You know what?  I'm a big girl, and I'm proud of it, but I'm honest about it.  Listen to this show.  Well, I'm honest about it.  If you look at this page, you'll see all my pictures.  That's good.  All right, we get it.  You're honest about your kindness.  What are you trying to say about this subject?  If you look at hers, all her pictures are, like you said, the iceberg pictures, where 
[01:43:00]  it's just the face and the chest, and nothing from the boobs down.  Because she's shaped like a pear.  No, more like a pumpkin.  More like a pumpkin.  Just a big, round fatty.  It's like, you ever see Barton Fink when John Goodby goes, okay, I have a weight problem.  All right, Tara's now listening to herself.  Could you go back to that website?  Sure.  I don't know why you need to go.  Where are you going, Iraq?  Come on, man.  Finding something else.  Just pay attention. 
[01:43:30]  You can find something else.  By the way, there's another girl on there, and she's got the angle up, like where she's,  again, she's holding it, like.  Holding the camera above her head, looking straight up at it.  Yes.  Right?  Yeah, that, let me tell you what that does.  Thins the face out.  Her hair is placed by her cheekbones.  So that thins the face out.  She's got bangs that kind of go into her eyes, and the camera is on the ceiling.  Right.  It's like she's looking into a ceiling fan.  And that keeps the fatness far away from leaning into a ceiling fan. 
[01:44:00]  It also makes the eyes look very attractive, because you get a lot of the white of the  eyes underneath, and it makes our eyes look very big.  All right, Anthony, you're starting to sound like Project Runway.  I really am.  My hair was cut correctly.  Yes, of course.  She's gorgeous.  But then the reality is, what is that?  It's not the same person.  She's at some kind of street fair.  It's daylight.  She's with the crowd.  She's giving the peace sign.  She is the crowd.  Yeah, and she is. 
[01:44:30]  This can't be the same girl.  The other picture looks like a girl that would be easily 150 pounds heavier than the one we're  looking at.  And then you realize the ceiling fan she probably avoided, because it reminded her of when propellers  would hit her back while she was in the lake on the boat.  What a fat body.  And believe me, I've hooked up with girls like this, where you talk to them, and they say-  Oh, we believe you.  Believe me.  You might not believe this one.  Believe me, you.  She actually looks like a girl that I met up with before MySpace. 
[01:45:00]  Which picture?  The bottom one.  Oh, of course.  Please.  All right, let's go to Vinny in Jersey.  We got another example as we talk to Vinny.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right.  Yeah, so I met this girl at MySpace.  It was about last year, actually.  So she looked cute in the pictures.  You know, the lighting was all good.  She had this nice, fine blonde hair, pretty face.  So we agreed to meet, all right?  So I meet up with this girl.  She steps out of the car, and it's when I was in Mario World or something.  I swear to God, this girl's like Kirby. 
[01:45:30]  She was what?  She looked like Kirby from, you know, the Nintendo game.  Nice reference.  She's a fatty, huh?  Yeah, man.  Like the pictures look awesome.  She looked like Tyron from Resident Evil.  Yeah.  All right, very good.  Let's go to Princeton and say hi to Phil.  Phil, what's up?  Phil.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey.  You missed a real biggie here.  It's the women that go to the mall and get a glamour shot with a fuzzy filter on it. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, those glamour shots.  Yeah, fuzzy filters.  There's another show.  Wow.  A totally contrived pose, and it's like, ugh.  You know, 80s hairdo and an outfit from I don't know where.  80s hairdo, the big puffy hair.  We are jerks, though.  Colin is right.  These are girls who just want to have a few MySpace friends and finally understand what  it's like to kind of be cute and have guys flirt with you instead of avoiding you like  the disgusting animal that you are.  I understand, like, you know.  But they don't have to show up then, you know.  They can just keep it in front of the space.  I understand maybe putting on a little makeup, Jimmy, and maybe turn the lights down a little 
[01:46:30]  bit for your photo.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you explain the next one?  That is brutally deceiving.  That's trickery right there.  That girl should be arrested.  She should be arrested.  Where?  The next one is amazing.  Yeah.  Explain this one.  Well, basically what I said.  Over at that monitor, Colin.  Sorry.  Basically what I said, she turned down the lighting to make it nice and soft.  She definitely put a lot of eye makeup on around her eyes, you know, to make them all  dark around the edges there, right?  And turned down the lighting to make it soft.  A vampire would go, can we turn on some lights? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  And his pitchfake, excuse me.  Oh, you know what the problem was?  I forgot to set you up.  How dark is it?  People can be cruel.  Okay, I have a weight problem.  The bra couldn't be skimpier.  It was so skimpy.  The bra couldn't be skimpier, showing ample boobage.  Very nice breasts, right?  Yeah.  Very nice.  Nice black bra. 
[01:47:30]  Get to the sloss and cut off.  Get out of your car.  Cut off your sloss and get into your car.  Go to the I-5.  Marty's talking about Syracuse.  Sally Syracuse on there.  And once again, the photo's from above.  She's kind of looking up at the camera, and you see the nice face with the eyes well done.  Yeah.  And very nice boobage and a very, very skimpy bra.  That's all you see.  You don't see her waistline or nothing else.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  And then what would we get?  The next photo.  And that's after training camp for Nebraska.  The next photo is her still with kind of the same look on her face, but it's a front shot 
[01:48:00]  where there's a center across where her breasts would be because obviously she was topless.  Yeah.  But then it shows her below all the way down to the thighs, and it looks like a human head  has been placed on an elephant.  Yeah.  That's what it looks like.  Picture her.  Take a light bulb, turn it upside down, and put hair where the screw end is.  Wow.  That's what she looks like.  Yes.  Giant, big, fat person.  But not as useful as a light bulb.  She can't light a room. 
[01:48:30]  She darkens everywhere she goes by her blockage of the sun.  Picture shallow Hal with dark hair.  Yeah.  She's that big.  She is that big.  And that picture.  She's got the biggest panties I've ever seen in my life.  The top picture is stunning.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You'd want to meet the top picture, right?  Yeah.  Would it be one of those cases where the guy kills her, like when they find out it's  a transvestite, and then the guy kills her, you know?  Or let's do a movie like, yeah, like Boys Don't Cry about a fat, ugly girl.  Or when the guy kills her, or the guy continues to see her anyway, just pretends he doesn't 
[01:49:00]  know.  The guy.  You know.  You know.  The guy.  I have a friend.  And by the way, Bob Kelly's picture, if you listen to Bob Kelly's picture, is if you  look at Bob Kelly's picture, he's got like this sassy lip Percy thing, like he's blowing  a kiss.  And he looks like the professional.  Yeah.  He looks like the guy from the professional.  Dude.  Wow.  Those are old Bob Kelly pictures.  They're deceitful.  Like there's a picture of Bob with his little fingers up like, dude.  Like he's a real rebel.  Hey.  F you, dude.  My space rebel. 
[01:49:30]  F you.  He's trying too hard to be cute.  But it's because Bob used to be such a handsome stud, let's be honest.  Yes.  But now, you know, he doesn't realize.  Yeah.  All right.  It's horrendous.  Let's go to Kyle in Michigan.  Kyle.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  One thing these big fat messes do is they'll take pictures of themselves peeking from behind  a tree.  Linger longer.  Oh, wow.  All right.  That goes back.  I did work at a radio station and we all had to take publicity photos.  And there was a girl that had a real hot voice, but she wasn't much of a looker. 
[01:50:00]  So they decided to put like Tom Cruise sunglasses on her and have her have her peeking from behind  a tree.  Oh, what is to continue the clever ruse?  You saw none of that girl.  None of it.  Like it was a tree, the side of her hair and glasses.  I don't want to blow up her spot.  She's really nice.  But she had such a hot voice that the radio station understood a lot of guys were listening  to her at night because they're picturing a really hot girl because her voice was so 
[01:50:30]  hot.  But then, you know, this web thing became huge and everyone needed their pictures online  and like, ooh, what are we going to do?  So it was Tom Cruise glasses and a tree for her.  Is this another website?  Another one.  What's this one, Iraq?  What's that one?  This one's called The Truth About My Space.  It shows you all the different poses and techniques.  Is it the truthaboutmyspace.com?  Well, what is this one?  Drunkreport.com.  Better be.  And then you can find it at Slash My Space.  The Truth About My Space. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, the one we didn't talk about.  The blurry.  The blurry picture.  Go to that second one, Iraq.  Can we see the second one?  The Asian girl?  The Asian girl.  The self-portrait is used a lot.  Why would it be at The Truth About My Space?  Why would it be?  They're showing you tricks, but you can't see what the girls really look like, so these  might not be tricks.  Yeah, but they're talking about extreme angles, the up-close dark photo.  What else?  But they're not showing you the girls as they are.  Like, these could be the way they really look.  This could be an accurate representation of the girls.  The long hair.  First of all, Jim, you just saw it for one minute.  The guy worked a long time on it.  Why don't you give it a break? 
[01:51:30]  We're critiquing the guy's critique of My Space and let it slide.  No, I want more detail.  He's not giving us details.  Well, they're saying when you see the obvious photo of the goods, they call it, like, you  know, the girl down below, and she's not willing to show her face, that that's a problem, too.  No, she just knows what a man wants.  No one cares about her head.  She could have advertising taped to her face for all I care.  If I show up, she could have a pet coat sign on her face and nothing.  You just kept going.  I know I did, because I felt absolutely...  We didn't know where the pause was. 
[01:52:00]  I felt disinterest in silence.  Stop.  We needed a period there, so we know that the sentence was over.  Well, I figured I would use that to my...  I would say, I'll take the fact that everyone here sees me bombing, and I'll spin it into  a good one, and it's just a pet coat one.  Let's go to Jeff in New York.  Jeff says dating websites even worse.  Jeff.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, your shows have been on fire lately, for real.  I just want to let you know.  For real, yeah.  Thank you, sir.  You have no idea.  The photos on these websites are like glamour shots compared to what these boards look 
[01:52:30]  like in real life.  Yeah, that's where we're getting at for the last half hour.  Yeah, I can understand that on the dating site, though.  But again, wouldn't you be embarrassed to show up?  Like, I would rather show pictures of myself that are less attractive, so when I show up,  they're like, wow, you're a little cuter than I thought you'd be.  I think everyone tries to look good in a photo, but there's a point where you're just being  ridiculous with what you really are.  Like, if I want to meet a girl, I'll take a photo of myself.  I have a sweater, and I have, like, a collar around it in front of a fireplace.  That's a good look for you.  It really is.  A gentleman's photo.  Yeah.  Let's go back up to Boston. 
[01:53:00]  Listening on BCN, it's Charlie.  Charlie, what's up?  Charlie.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, what about a nice, accurate picture of a hot chick?  And then when you finally meet her, you see that the arm crutches that she wears were never  in any of the photos.  What, like the arm braces?  Did that happen to you?  Yeah.  So you met her, and she comes popping out of the car and then starts walking over with  her crutches?  Oh, she was already sitting down in a bar, dude.  Oh, wow. 
[01:53:30]  Very nice.  Let's go to Elena, I think, in Boston.  Elena.  Hi, how are you?  Hey, Elena.  I just want to say how horrible I think MySpace is.  My husband was put in jail over somebody copying his MySpace page, and no one did.  He did a thing about it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right.  Wait a minute.  This sounds interesting.  Yeah.  We're going to pick this story apart.  Hold on, Larry Craig family member.  A believable excuse.  What?  Yeah.  What are the details?  Details.  Oh, okay. 
[01:54:00]  Somebody copied his MySpace page, copied just his picture, made that fake page private,  and what they did was they sent his ex-girlfriend a threatening message.  No, because IP address would be revealed that it wasn't from him, and he would not have gone  to jail.  Oh, well, here's the best part.  The DA, the courts, no one ever did anything about that.  If they did their job right the first time, he never would have been taken to jail on  my birthday.  Well, hold on.  Who was his defense lawyer?  Was it Arthur Kirkland? 
[01:54:30]  She doesn't care that he went to jail.  She just cares that he went to jail on her birthday.  Anyone else pick up on that?  Yeah.  On my birthday.  It's my birthday.  She doesn't care that he went to jail.  Oh, you self-centered.  Why do you have to do it on my birthday?  What happened with the ex-girlfriend?  What happened?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  Honestly, no one knows where she is.  No one really gives a crap about where she is.  Oh.  But all I know is that she's living a good life right now because she doesn't have to  worry about what's going on.  She's in the clear way.  Breathing. 
[01:55:00]  So wait, miss.  You're saying that he went to jail for a threatening MySpace message?  That you're not telling us everything?  He didn't send, and then the girlfriend disappeared.  Oh, yeah.  They also found dead bodies in his backyard in shallow graves.  This is where she is, she said.  Yeah.  No, no.  This actually happened back in August.  No, they, like I said, if they did their job right the first time, he never would have  gone to jail.  Then the funny thing was, he was sitting at my work, at my old job, when the message 
[01:55:30]  was sent.  No computers.  I mean, it's the Angelos, for crying out loud.  So, miss.  No computers.  No nothing.  No internet.  Why was he doing it your job on your birthday?  Exactly.  No, no, no.  What do you do besides sound like Pacino's wife in Dog Day Afternoon?  He was at my computer on my birthday.  He said, send the MySpace message, you fat pig.  I said, is he going to kill me and throw my body in the river?  No, no, no.  The court date was on my birthday.  It was a month later, but the court date was on my birthday. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, get over it.  You'll have enough birthdays.  Exactly.  Hopefully, that'll be the last one.  Your stupid birthday.  Enough about your stupid birthday.  I was going to say, what happened?  You want a gift card?  We'll send it out.  What happened, though?  What happened, miss?  A threatening message.  What did it say?  If you don't let me see Riley, then I'll take care of you.  Our eyes will be on you.  Some bull crap like that.  He's quoting Tupac.  How long has he been in jail?  He was in jail for 23 days.  He's out now.  So for that message, he went to jail? 
[01:56:30]  Huh?  He went to jail for that message alone?  Yeah.  No.  I don't believe it.  One threatening message would not get you a month in jail?  No.  Oh, no.  Well, apparently someone did the same thing last year and put him on probation.  Was it on your birthday?  I heard her birthday.  Enough about your birthday.  I think this girl likes her birthday, huh, Jimmy?  She loves her birthday.  Perhaps more than that.  Perhaps more than that.  All right, Elena. 
[01:57:00]  We don't buy your story.  There's more to it that you're not willing to reveal.  My opinion is your husband's a creep.  Yeah.  You're being naive.  What?  Someone else?  Someone set up another threatening message that wasn't from him?  Yeah.  Stop it.  All right.  Let's be naive, Kate.  One more before the break.  It's K, by the way.  Not Kate.  K.  Jennifer in Rockland.  Jennifer?  Oh, Kate.  Hi, boys.  Hi.  I never did the MySpace page thing until recently.  And, of course, this weekend I happened to leave Jimmy a comment. 
[01:57:30]  Uh-oh.  And I'm freaking out thinking y'all talking about me.  No, I actually...  Well, let's see your picture.  We'll tell you what's going on.  Go to my page.  E-Rock's going to my page.  Did Jim respond to the comment?  No, Jim did not respond to the comment.  He's got thousands of people leaving comments.  He's got a comment.  Yeah.  Of course.  There's a million people.  Well, how...  When did you leave the comment?  I'm just thumbing through a few of these myself.  Trying to...  What?  People are giving me links to MySpace and...  Right, right.  He's in there.  Just horrific.  Jennifer, can we look at your MySpace picture? 
[01:58:00]  Why?  You do some of that MySpace voodoo?  No, I don't think...  By the way, we want everyone to throw MySpace voodoo in Google today.  MySpace voodoo.  Did you try to take...  Did you try to take a sexier picture than maybe you should have?  No, I did not try to take a picture.  I just took pictures that I had.  Oh.  It's a computer saddest.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're jammed up here.  Hold on the line, Jennifer.  We'll try to get back to you after the break. 
[01:58:30]  We got Colin Quinn in studio.  He's playing Gotham Comedy Club.  What?  Friday and Saturday, Sunday?  Yeah, it's Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  I was trying to show Colin how a real page was set up, by the way.  Not just the same photo 30 times with your dates in white, which are hard to read.  Have someone else to your page.  Yeah, I'm going to.  I mean, go down to the top.  Just real quick.  Just show them.  Go down to the top of the page.  Who does your page, Jimmy?  My agent.  And I answer the emails.  To top.  The very top.  First of all, nobody asks you part two of that.  You don't answer all your emails and lies.  I do.  Let me explain.  Shut up.  Let me explain why, Jimmy. 
[01:59:00]  Let me explain why Jimmy wanted us to go to the top of his MySpace page.  Because there's a huge banner that says, Jim Norton and Concert, New Year's Eve, North  York Theater, and Westbury.  He doesn't.  He's not trying to help you out.  I am trying to help you out.  That was a clever way for us to get his plug in.  His New Year's Eve show.  I'll be too cynical.  With tickets on sale this Friday at 9 a.m.  Click here to purchase tickets.  It's all right there.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  What does that have to do about a nice MySpace page?  Because you have to have links to your stuff.  You just have a bunch of white letters. 
[01:59:30]  No one can read your stuff.  But you're saying the Northport what?  New Year's Eve gig?  North Fork.  It's Westbury Music Fair.  New Year's Eve.  And tickets on sale tomorrow morning.  That's not about me.  It's about you.  You're in New York somewhere, too, this week.  Which is nice.  Colin, I know you're right there with me.  Give me a little fist touch there on that one.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll continue.  We'll continue.  We'll continue.  We'll continue.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Colin Quinn in studio playing Gotham Comedy Club here in New York City. 
[02:00:00]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  There you go.  There you go.  What are you talking about with this?  Wilford Brimley.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was just on MySpace.  MySpace.  YouTube.  And there are so many Wilford Brimley little goofs that people have put together.  About his diabetes commercial.  You ever see that one?  Where he talks about getting your diabetes supplies from Liberty. 
[02:00:30]  I get them delivered to my house.  I got diabetes.  And everyone I know.  And every time I see it, I go, why isn't he saying diabetes?  What is diabetes?  Oh, that's my catchphrase.  And then someone's like, I want to be the beatus man.  The beatus man.  Wilford Brimley, like, he was an actor in everything.  You know his face if you see it.  He's that big mustache guy.  The big white mustache.  He's been in so many movies. 
[02:01:00]  And now all you see him is talking about, I have diabetes.  And I get my supplies through Liberty.  If you got diabetes.  And you sit there and go, why is he saying it like that?  But why did this take off?  Because he's an ass.  Was it Family Guy or one of those?  Usually that's what happens.  I don't know.  Like Family Guy or South Park will make some obscure, like, you know, joke about, like, somebody from the past.  And next thing you know, it's a YouTube sensation. 
[02:01:30]  There's, like, remixes that people have done and parodies that they've done about him.  Oh, is that from Family Guy?  Why don't we get some of the Brimley stuff for tomorrow's radio show?  Get some Family Guy stuff.  Because now that I see you searched it on YouTube, there's hundreds of them.  Dude, it's just one of those things that you think you're the only one that's thinking it when you see it.  And then you realize, okay, everyone thinks this guy's an ass and is saying, why is he saying diabetes? 
[02:02:00]  We'll have a lot more tomorrow, but we got a little taste for you today.  Diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes.  Testing supplies.  Diabetes.  Come and rock me, diabetes.  Dude, do a song like that.  How do they not think you're going to get goofed on?  See, Jimmy.  I don't think you understand.  Diabetes.  Yeah, it's just one of those commercials that pop on and you're like, what is he doing? 
[02:02:30]  It's all over YouTube.  Big, fat Wilford Brimley.  He was scary in the firm.  God, could they have gotten a bad guy?  He was just a nerd.  The Quaker Oats guy chasing somebody with a gun.  It was idiotic.  That was pretty creepy.  They did a good parody on that one on Seinfeld, I guess, with the mail delivery one.  Where Kramer was protesting the post office and they pulled him in.  He's the postal inspector.  That was a very funny one.  Regardless if you know it or not in the room, I'm sure there are plenty of people listening 
[02:03:00]  going, I saw that and I found it very funny.  Hello, Newman.  Yeah, that's it.  Colin's with you.  Sure he is.  Oh, Colin's right there with you.  You know, you have a picture with Jerry on your MySpace page.  You should know every episode.  Yeah, you would think you would have seen the show.  I'm the opposite of those girls.  My MySpace page is so horrendous.  It drives people away.  It doesn't attract them.  I know, but you talk about my celebrity photos and you're a celebrity, although one of minor  stature.  You are a celebrity. 
[02:03:30]  I'm not minor stature.  I'm just descending rapidly.  No.  Is that it?  Don't patronize me.  He goes, no.  No.  First of all, if I am or not, your opinion is not going to matter either way.  Now, go on.  Well, I'm just saying this.  Shut up and continue.  I am.  Go on.  I can't shut up and continue.  Those things are antonyms.  It's better not end with Northport Theater or Northport Theater.  No, no, no.  That's New Year's.  Who cares about tomorrow morning tickets on sale?  It's irrelevant.  Yeah.  I'm talking about your picture with Seinfeld.  You're a famous guy. 
[02:04:00]  You have a picture with Seinfeld on your MySpace page.  It's a disgrace.  Yeah, it's true.  What's his picture on his MySpace?  It's probably not with you.  It probably is with me.  No, it's not.  Does he even have a MySpace, do you think?  I'm sure he does.  I bet he doesn't.  Hey, we got a great little news story.  It is Perv News Thursday.  We love to find these little pervy stories.  And this one's a classic today.  Check this out.  I know a Creek man accused of planting a hidden camera in his friend's bathroom  will spend the next year in prison.  Only on 12 News, Caroline Leiter's report sent an emotional morning in court 
[02:04:30]  for both families affected by his crime.  Sean Komorowski came to court asking the judge for probation, not prison.  If I could take the pain away, believe me, I would.  He admitted to the crime.  He bought this camera clock radio at a sharper image store and for more than a year collected  the video images it captured from his best friend's bathroom.  Oh, God.  Who is he watching?  His buddy or his buddy's kids?  We'll find out more, but... 
[02:05:00]  It doesn't matter.  The guy sounds like a poor slob.  Let him go.  Well, that's what I was getting at there, Colin.  He's a disabled man.  Yes, can't he have a little pleasure?  Disabled man plants Cameron Best Friend's bathroom.  Now, why the bathroom?  Because he likes that activity?  Or is that the only place his little crippled body can get it to?  Because when you're disabled, your whole life revolves around the bathroom,  so it's associated with a lot of things.  Oh, very good, Colin.  I'm telling.  That's true.  That's true.  This little twisted body in the bathroom.  Old target chest.  You know what I mean? 
[02:05:30]  Let's...  Let's...  It's kind of sad.  Do you think he should go to jail now?  Part of me feels a little bad for the guy.  Me too.  Really?  Disabled guy probably didn't get any action his entire life.  Just wants a little thrill.  Just wants a little peek.  Wanted to catch a predator that had this young guy,  and the guy goes,  you knew she was 13?  He goes, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's one of my fantasies.  Chris Hansen's like, what?  Yeah.  I don't know what this guy was...  Okay, you're free to go.  I want to make it perfectly clear.  I don't know what this guy was peeking at.  Yeah, what the hell's he looking at?  I'm hoping it's hot, you know, college co-eds, but... 
[02:06:00]  I thought it was his buddy.  His buddy's house.  I don't know what's going in his buddy's house there.  Maybe his buddy was a real swinger.  Yeah, maybe.  Had the buddy not known,  he goes, here, put this clock in your bathroom.  Could you turn it to the left a little?  Just so you can see it better.  It looks like that stupid clock in Scarface  where the 12 is missing.  A big black hole.  But just savvy drug dealers don't notice  there's no 12 on the clock.  And he wants you to put it on the tub ledge  so it's at the level of the guy's ass. 
[02:06:30]  How stupid are these people?  Could you put it on the ceiling  and aim it down to between your legs on the toilet?  Hang this clock in the ceiling.  Komarowski's parents begged the judge for leniency,  saying since childhood,  Sean's been teased and tormented  because of his physical disabilities.  His mom told the court  the same disabilities that made him a target in school  would make him a target in prison.  The world is a...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What's the disability that made him a target?  His ass starts at the back of his neck 
[02:07:00]  and it ends at his ankles.  He has a giant ass.  That would make him a target.  That kid's all ass.  And it's a birthmark  and it looks like a tattoo  and it says,  I dare you to,  right over the ass.  What's his disability?  The world is a cruel place.  I don't want to imagine  what it would be like for him  being behind prison walls.  But his victims said prison is where he belongs, 
[02:07:30]  that this camera violated their privacy  and took away any sense of security they had.  In the end,  Judge Joseph Donald agreed.  This court finds  that the probation recommendation  would unduly depreciate  the serious nature of this offense.  He sentenced Komorowski  to a year in prison.  His family, devastated,  saying he needs help.  His victims,  who didn't want to be on camera,  were relieved.  They don't want to explain 
[02:08:00]  who the victims were.  And what was his disability?  I don't know.  And show the video from the clock  that they don't want to show up.  They said his disability  is it was Komorowski's Polish.  He was sentenced to prison time  and that made me feel,  that's going to make me feel  a little bit safer.  Oh, she sounds hot.  Komorowski was the best man  in the victim's wedding  and had been friends with them  for more than a decade.  Even though he did plead guilty,  he never said why he committed the crime.  What do you think?  Why do you think?  Why he did?  He liked looking at toilet footage.  That's my educated guess. 
[02:08:30]  Idiot.  He's a bit of a voyeur.  Yes, Danny.  I just wanted to make it clear  that the victim was the friend's wife.  They do show her  in the video footage.  Was she hot?  All right.  That makes more sense.  She was a mess?  Yeah.  She should have been flattered.  Oh, she's probably taking  like tub footage  instead of shower footage.  Yeah, I'm assuming  that it was probably her  getting out of the shower.  How'd they catch him?  So what's the big deal?  That I don't know.  The guy was desperate, obviously.  Well, yeah.  And how would he sneak  into the bathroom  to unload tape? 
[02:09:00]  How'd that happen?  I don't know the specifics  of how that specific camera works.  Well, that's what Jim's  trying to get to.  Of course it is.  I mean, if he was best friends  with the guy,  I'm assuming that he had,  you know,  he had access to the guy's house  on a fairly regular basis.  Colin and I are good friends.  I've been in this bathroom  once in six years.  Yeah.  Which means I have  a lot of footage to collect.  If you remember  that clock I gave you.  All right.  We got one more quickie  before we get out of here.  Perf News continues  with this fine story.  He calls himself 
[02:09:30]  baseball player.  Some holiday shoppers, though,  are using a few different terms  to describe him  or at least his actions.  That's disgusting.  Disgusting.  That's disgusting.  Oh, there's your...  Oh, I love it.  The neighbors,  those who contribute  nothing to the story.  Yes.  What are they going to say?  That's fantastic.  What's he do, this guy?  We're going to find out,  but obviously  it's something horrific.  We're hearing the opinions  of neighbors  and other people  before we hear the crime.  Well, I think it's  opinions of shoppers 
[02:10:00]  from what I got  from the beginning  of that story.  Some holiday shoppers  feel is another word.  Oh, holiday shoppers.  People that are standing  on line for a wee or something.  He's getting, yeah,  he's getting in the way  of the commerce thing.  Can we start over again?  I'm sorry, my apologies.  Running out of show.  He calls himself  baseball player.  Some holiday shoppers, though,  are using a few  different terms  to describe him  or at least his actions.  That's disgusting.  Disgusting.  That's disgusting.  There's obviously  something wrong with him.  According to the website  consumerist.com, 
[02:10:30]  which is a consumerism blog,  this man is a, quote,  bad consumer.  Why?  Because the 21-year-old  college student  who likes baseball  and camping  also likes masturbating  in the Arrowhead  Town Center  in Glendale.  I'm going to give it a kiss.  I tell you.  Well, this guy goes  to these stores  and does his thing 
[02:11:00]  on camera.  On camera.  Where are the dressing rooms?  Oh.  Huh?  Just in the aisles.  Yeah, just in the aisles.  Yeah.  How fun would that be?  That's his gig, man.  Let's learn more.  The mop guy  must be busy in that place.  Of course, the website,  this man has posted  more than 30 videos  of himself masturbating  in many stores.  Stores like Dillard's,  Walmart,  and Barnes & Noble.  But so far,  neither police  nor Arrowhead Mall  has received  one complaint.  Now, though,  after 3TV contacted  them this morning, 
[02:11:30]  they've launched  an investigation.  We are aware  of the website  and we're working  closely with  Glendale Police Department  to check its validity.  But to date,  we have no reports  of this incident.  The guy rules.  This guy does rules.  Wow.  Someone told the news  about his videos online.  He's just finding  his internet angle.  His angle is to go.  That's it.  He wants to be  an internet star.  Doing his thing  in the aisles  of big-time stores.  Good for him.  What do you got, Dan?  Yeah, it's good for him 
[02:12:00]  until you bite into a Cinnabon  at the Starbucks  in the Barnes & Noble.  The skills from the news story  were just hysterical  because they had taken  obviously still frames  from his videos  that he made.  So it was just like  you'd see some old grandma  looking at a towel  or something in an aisle  and everything below the waist  has been blurred out.  I think I've actually  seen footage of this guy.  I saw something like that  where a guy brought  his own camera  obviously in a case  and he's in a library  and you could see  he's got sweatpants  and he's just pulling  his sweatpants down 
[02:12:30]  and he would do it  for a second  and there's a fat lady  in the back  perusing books.  It was just  antisocial behavior.  Yes, of course.  In my ideal world  a guy like him  good for him  would be killed.  Really?  Yes.  You don't like him?  Colin.  No, I don't.  Let's kill him.  By the way  the whole time  He's finding his niche  in showbiz.  Can I say one thing?  While we're doing this  we're talking about Star Real  the whole time  we're talking about this  in the background  I'm watching  Montel Williams  playing Guitar Hero 3.  Yeah, that was a little odd.  This world is finished.  This is the last 
[02:13:00]  of the story  because we've got to get out of here.  Police say since this morning  they believe the man  has pulled all 30  of his videos  off the internet.  Pulled the videos.  Right now they're trying  to identify him  and want to figure out  if there are any victims  of indecent exposure.  Meanwhile,  holiday shoppers  say if they should run  into the man  who calls himself  baseball player  they'll run faster  than a real baseball great  stealing home.  They always don't  rap on a little  way to wrap it up.  That's so funny. 
[02:13:30]  Why couldn't she have  said something funny  to the times of baseball?  They'll run faster  than Thurman Munson  from Flaming Wreckage.  You're going to  go with a baseball reference?  They'll run faster  than Billy Martin's forehead  from a windshield  in the snow.  Because it's California  and they're going to  do those references.  Oh, you're probably right.  Yeah, not Yankee references.  That was a non-story.  He was getting away  with this.  No one noticed.  So we're going to  continue on XM.  Are you coming over, Colin?  Oh, yeah.  Good boy.  There you go.  Colin's at the 
[02:14:00]  Gotham Comedy Club  here in New York  on 23rd Street  tonight through  Sunday night.  What?  Okay, 23rd Street  tonight through  Sunday night.  I guess, I don't know  what their website is  but Gotham Comedy Club  is pretty easy.  Oh, tomorrow  we got Jason Statham  and Guy Ritchie  are in studio  launching their new film  which I can't see  because the publishers  won't give three copies.  Thank you, stupid.  Shut up, you crummy idiot.  I want to see the movie.  You stink at the host.  Get off.  I'll be doing it.  I'm very good.  You're terrible.  Tomorrow morning  my New Year's Eve  tickets go on sale  for the whatever theater.  Get him off, he's crummy. 
[02:14:30]  I'm not crummy.  Watch your language.  Why don't we give  some love to Syracuse today.  Stay tuned for Alexis.  Scorch.  On 95X.  Scorch, the kingdom  of nakedness  is at another station.  I don't even know  where he works these days.  Who knows?  It's all about Alexis  on 95X next.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was watching  and just bent of a root.  All right.  We're out of here.  See you guys tomorrow.  I've got no place to go.  I'm so jealous. 
[02:15:00]  Opian Anthony.  Opian Anthony.  Opian Anthony.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  Opian Anthony. 
[02:15:30]  Opian Anthony. 
[02:16:00]  Opian Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Jimmy is chomping at the bit over there.  What do you got, Jimmy?  Well, me and Kyle are just insulting each other.  Oh, it's just, they're just very hurtful.  No, because Jimmy put up a great suggestion.  You guys have to have my manager, and he's got some wild tales from his trips.  And then I mentioned, yeah, let's put my accountant in, you jackass.  No, I see.  Shut your mouth.  That's where you're wrong, though, man.  I've heard these stories from Jonathan. 
[02:19:00]  The guy's fucking insane.  Yeah, he's got to be a fucking arms dealer.  It's not like he's going to Vegas or to Yosemite.  Yosemite, Jesus.  Yosemite.  Yosemite.  Yosemite.  Yosemite.  Yosemite.  This guy is like, he's got pictures of African kings going by with armed guards as he's on the side of the road for the parade.  He's like Jay Peterman from Seinfeld.  You know that show.  It's not exactly like him.  My mate, bring it up again.  Excuse me. 
[02:19:30]  He's a guy that, you know, sells 700 Sundays in Sierra Leone.  So I'm really not that blown away.  Sierra Leone.  Mr. Corleone.  Michael Corleone.  Michael Corleone.  Yeah, he just travels a lot.  So I just mentioned that.  And as we were talking, Colin just was saying, why don't you bring on your accountant?  And he was dismissing me by not looking at me with his fucking awful middle finger pointed at me.  Yeah.  Which I thought was definitely disrespectful.  Well, here's the thing about Jim.  As you guys know, I spoke to you guys briefly at the Pat Cooper roast and I said I'm really disgusted with Jim. 
[02:20:00]  And as you know, I'm only half joking when I say things like that.  Yeah.  And I mentioned that.  Here's what bothers me about Jim.  What?  Okay.  I've mentioned this to him before.  Okay.  We're in a car one day and I was probably seeing him.  He drives me up down this crummy car, non-celebrity car.  The fancy caddy.  What are you talking about?  It's a caddy that looks like he drove you up down.  Obviously, you haven't taken a ride with Jimmy in a while.  Camry caddy.  It's a Camry caddy.  It looks like a Camry.  It feels like a Camry and nobody knows it's a caddy unless you say it.  Caddy actually took the insignia off. 
[02:20:30]  So he really caught me, him and his girl.  And so maybe I was thinking I'm a little hard.  You forget sometimes because we're comedians and we bust balls.  But when you call Jimmy, I kept calling him an ugly creep and how he's worked out to look mediocre.  And I forget that even though we're comedians and we bust balls, probably his childhood had a lot of pain and horror, as he should have.  So as in suddenly, here we are, me being a snide kind of idiot, his girlfriend sitting there probably politely putting up with it.  And then Jim outburst goes, so what about you? 
[02:21:00]  You act like you were a 10 when you were younger.  You weren't that great looking.  Just with total anger, like holding in this nonsense.  And I was like, first of all, I never thought I was a 10.  I was a hard 7.  He goes, you were a fucking 6.  No.  You will not make a monologue out of this.  No.  He's lying.  He's lying.  He's lying.  Can I finish my statement?  No, because it's a 40-minute dissertation.  That's not true.  It's a falsehood.  You're spreading falsehoods.  I wasn't angry.  Here's what Colin does.  He was angry that person.  Believe me, I wasn't mad. 
[02:21:30]  Me and my girlfriend still laugh at that house.  She's like, what did Colin say he was that day?  I'm like, a hard 7.  But he acts like, Colin acts like he's fucking 10 pounds away from the glory days.  Like he was fucking.  Oh, no, I don't.  Well, all right, 140.  He acts like he was beautiful.  And he was not a bad looking guy.  That's all I said.  I never thought I was a great looking guy.  But you act like you were gorgeous.  But that's what I'm saying.  The fact that he thinks that.  But no, it's true.  First of all, even if it had been true, which I know how I really thought.  But even if I did think that, why wouldn't you let an old man have his own delusion?  Because you're not that much older than me. 
[02:22:00]  He screamed.  I didn't scream at you.  The amount of anger there.  And here's my other point, okay?  Here's my other point.  What other point?  You haven't made one to begin with.  All right, here's my first and only point.  And he is a lot older than you.  He's 10 years older than me.  I'm 48.  I'm 39.  You're nine years older than me.  But in entertainment years, Colin is a hell of a lot older than you.  Yeah.  But here's what bothers me.  The fact that he's angry about that.  No, it's true.  That was pretty funny, I thought.  Well, I don't think it was an insult, but apparently it was.  I don't like the fact that Jim, right after his last special, goes to the club every night 
[02:22:30]  because it's almost like, hey, man, I'm a gym rat.  I just work at stand-up.  You're a compulsive ass.  Oh.  Take a few weeks off.  Shut up and let me finish.  No.  Quit it.  I'll tell you why.  I'm not a gym rat.  You think to yourself, hey, I'm a guy that just, blue collar, I take my lunch pail into  the club every night with your fake humility, and I'm putting a stop to it today.  Why?  I don't want people.  Shut your face.  Hold on.  No, no, no.  Here's the thing.  You're compulsive.  Take a few weeks off and just breathe. 
[02:23:00]  I'm compulsive.  Have you ever seen yourself in front of a buffet?  Oh, that was hurtful.  Of course it was.  But the reason I do it is because.  I don't think a buffet would.  I know.  I couldn't think of a better way to say it.  It was good.  But the bottom line is, I don't want people coming out after seeing the HBO special and seeing  the same shit.  You're going to get pissed off.  It's selfish.  I want to make more money.  I think what Kyle's trying to say, though, you don't seem to enjoy all the success at  times.  I do enjoy the success.  I love doing stand-up.  Is that a chore?  I'm trying to stop any enjoyment of the success.  I don't want him to enjoy it.  If he has any chance of enjoying it, I'm putting a stop to it now. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, look.  Another chewed pen.  The fucking, I'm going to keep chewing the pens.  I don't know.  Whoever it is is going to get.  What are you doing?  He's putting it up his hands.  There you go.  Whoever chews pens, enjoy the chewed pen, fucking cunt.  I mean, chew on that, shit.  Ew.  Now, wait a minute.  Yes, that's shit, all right.  Jim, you have to be careful with that kind of behavior.  No, I don't like, I want to do new stuff, so I was done with the set in June, and I  started doing new stuff.  I don't want you to do the same material.  People come out and see me, they're fucking not going to see the same act. 
[02:24:00]  You know what?  He's a little, I'm picking up something here.  What?  I don't want to completely bash Jimmy.  Jump in, please.  I'm picking up something.  I think Jimmy is assuming that everyone has seen the HBO special.  Yeah, you're right.  So that he's got to get new material, because when they go out, everyone that's there has  seen his old material.  No one has seen it, but it's more than that.  Not everyone, no.  But I do think that a good amount of people will come who have seen it. 
[02:24:30]  Hold on.  We're trying to change this up here.  Can I address my friend?  I think there's truth in both.  No, I don't assume everyone has seen it.  Believe me, I would love to be able to just live off that for another year, but you can't.  That's not what I'm saying.  What?  What I'm saying is that you think, you fancy yourself a humble gym rat that goes down to  the club and just works it out.  And I want you to stop coming to the club, and if I see you there again, I'm going to  punch you in the snout.  Well, you're never there.  What are you talking about, you fucking lonely psychopath?  If I decide to go there.  You know, you're writing a manifesto like fucking Ted Kaczynski. 
[02:25:00]  You're never there.  He's just in front of his computer, railing about technology and Jews and fucking lesbians  that run show business.  What are you talking about?  How do you know where I am?  He's starting to leave the house again.  He's fucking...  That's right.  I'm here, aren't I?  You're an agoraphobic creep.  You had to, because Mazzilli threatened to fire you if you didn't fucking plug.  Probably had eight tickets sold.  He's like, go on the radio.  No one knows you're in our club.  Oh, shit.  But that's why he's here to plug.  It's fine.  The hurt that is going on over here.  There's no hurt at all.  That's where you have to go out and plug when you're doing a gig. 
[02:25:30]  Do you believe this idiot's trying to act like Mr. Pragmatic?  Shut your mouth right now.  But it's the truth.  It's reality.  I am a very pragmatic, which I think means realistic guy.  I'm not exactly sure what pragmatic means.  Colin, what's going on with you?  Hopefully it means fun and joyful.  What's going on with Colin?  Well, actually what Jimmy's saying is semi-correct in that I have been writing my manifestos.  Okay?  But they're not really against anything in particular.  It's just basically it's a compilation.  You know, I have like...  What happened was I got ahead of myself psychologically and wrote thousands and thousands of pages. 
[02:26:00]  So my apartment looks a little bit like Kaczynski is.  A height.  A little bit like Beautiful Mind.  Yeah.  Just notes stuck to the walls with strings connecting bits together.  Yeah.  And that's the problem.  So I've been trying to organize it, but it's very difficult.  I wish I had like a...  You know, I fantasized about having like a really efficient Asian like assistant.  You know.  Yes.  In stockings.  And of course, the other part of it.  Yes.  In mail.  You know.  But I'm just...  That's what I've been going on with me, you know. 
[02:26:30]  Why don't you get yourself a Trapper Keeper?  I used to use those to organize.  That was Trapper.  Or the five-section dump book.  But I got like so many.  You know what I mean?  I was like thousands.  It is like...  It's gone a little out of my control.  Yeah.  What is this thing going to be?  A book someday?  Well, it's like 10...  It's just so many things.  It's too many pages of things.  Wow.  Are you being serious for once?  Yes, yes.  Yes.  So weird.  You just sit there and you're typing away.  No, he doesn't like this.  I just go to OB.  OB was like, so you got all the stuff?  Like, yeah, you're really trying to...  Like, I was like, yeah, OB understands. 
[02:27:00]  Like, I got him.  And he goes, you being serious?  I go, yeah.  He goes, it was weird.  It's weird when you get serious, Colin.  Oh.  I thought you meant it was weird that I have all my thousands of pages.  You're very protective.  Yes, you are.  We only see one side of you.  The sarcastic side.  We don't get to see the real sweet Colin.  We don't get to see the sweet Colin.  You have a big fat shell around you.  Looks like...  I picture you crying alone in your apartment some nights.  No, I'm not really crying, you know.  There's a lot more anger than me.  Chewing the inside of his mouth like a coke addict. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  Yeah, there's a lot more, you know.  We're just trying to see other sides of you today.  I can't imagine myself...  Yeah.  This is kind of an intervention.  You didn't realize what you stepped into today.  Well, I'm just trying to say, like, I'm not really...  I don't see myself as hurting myself before really damaging a lot of people.  A lot of other people.  Sure.  My own analysis of it, you know.  Really, you don't like when I was in your 30th floor apartment and he steps over the rail  and he's kind of hanging on and letting go for a second.  Did you know?  Yes, he was.  That's cool.  Yes, he was.  36th floor.  And doing like the...  Yes. 
[02:28:00]  Where you let go, fall backwards, and then grab the rail?  All right, Colin, that's a problem.  No, I've always been like that.  That's a bit of a problem.  No, I used to do that until crowded.  Lean out the window and hang on.  From what?  The fucking...  On the set?  No, the office on the 17th floor.  Why would you do that?  Wait, wait, wait.  Could you slow down a minute?  Whose apartment was this?  His.  My apartment.  So you have an outdoor space?  He's a balcony.  Balcony?  And he was on the outside of the rail?  Yes, he stepped outside the railing and he's like letting go for it.  Not going back that far.  That's hilarious.  What were you hoping for?  A really good reaction from your friends?  You know what I was hoping for? 
[02:28:30]  Butterfingers.  He was hoping a straight pigeon would come by and jar me.  And snip at his eye.  You were hoping for an ounce of care from Jim Norton.  The last thing you see is a smiling Jim Norton looking over the railing.  That's how Colin gets love.  He can't just say, I need some love.  He has to hang on to a rail so we'll all go, no, don't.  Like he wants us to.  He wants the value of having everyone appreciate the fact that.  Okay, somehow he's turning my great beginning analysis.  What was your beginning analysis? 
[02:29:00]  About you.  Well, what's about you?  And suddenly it's turn around about me.  So what?  That's the way life is.  Turn about is fair play, I always say.  And why would you?  And you would hang out.  That's a tough talk.  You would hang out the window?  Yeah, but that's.  That was easy?  I don't remember that.  That's such a small part of the manifesto.  I can't even believe we're discussing it.  That's nothing to me.  But you could have, you do understand, you could have fallen to your death.  Yes, but anything can happen.  But that didn't bother you or?  How far did he lean back before he grabbed hold again?  Doesn't matter. 
[02:29:30]  Not far.  But that doesn't matter.  Just the act of doing it.  Dude, I would be freaked out stepping on the other side of the rail, holding on tight.  But some people are also very scared of heights.  Like Bobby Kelly's been over at my house a couple times and he goes on the balcony, dude,  don't push me, you know, and it's like, no, he's afraid the balcony is going to fucking  just crack under his weight, as he should be.  You better run back in a steamroller under your fucking balcony and let him bob step onto  it.  Yeah.  He's scared that he's going to go right through that railing with a slight push.  He's scared and the balcony is also scared.  They look at each other with a mutual understanding. 
[02:30:00]  Just look over me from inside.  I'll do what I can for you, kid.  But while I'm stepping on that balcony, it would be like an elephant stepping onto a piece  of tracing paper.  Sure.  Poor Bob.  Not here to defend himself.  Fuck poor Bob with a black cock right in his mouth.  That's what I say to Bob.  Fucking juicy lips.  Fucking grab his head and fuck his throat.  Now you got Colin laughing. 
[02:30:30]  Or is he crying?  Who knows?  Are you crying?  Laughing?  What do you got over there, Colin?  That was a good tracing paper.  Yeah.  Okay.  That was very good.  I don't think it'll hold.  Tracing paper.  So you're going to be at Gotham, Colin.  Yeah.  But what about the manifesto?  I need to organize your system.  What are you trying to do?  Yeah, what is it?  I don't know.  Is it like a huge book?  Is it a book about your life?  It's everything.  It's everything.  Then start writing a blog.  Are you a blogger?  No.  I blogged for a couple days.  It was boring. 
[02:31:00]  Well, then why don't you fucking stop being such an isolated homo and fucking get someone  to help you straighten it out and sell it.  Yeah.  Why the isolation?  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  We are getting serious, Colin.  Yeah.  We're breaking it down.  Colin's depressed, I think.  That's my theory.  My theory is.  He hasn't told me that, but I theorize he's a little depressed.  Sell some drugs.  What?  The Suffolk County Solution.  And that's all my friend.  I know, but where are you from?  Aren't you from Chicago?  I'm from Suffolk.  What are you from?  Aren't you from?  Huntington.  No, not Ron Concombeau. 
[02:31:30]  He's changing the subject to where you're from.  That's never good.  I'll go right back to it.  Go ahead.  Are you depressed?  Why are you depressed?  No, I'm actually coming out of depression, but I was depressed for a couple of years.  How are you?  You seem way better than the last time I saw you.  Thank you.  Exactly.  I'm dead serious.  I'm being serious now.  I'm agreeing with you.  Thank you.  You had a distant look in your eyes for a while there.  Yes.  I don't see that today.  Thousand yards there.  Absolutely.  I don't see that today.  Were you?  That's right.  Did you name your fucking computer Charlene? 
[02:32:00]  About anything.  Full metal jacket.  Anything in particular or just one of those chemical imbalance depressions?  No, I think I was just depressed in general.  A lot of stuff.  I don't know.  I don't think it was chemical.  You find yourself sleeping late?  No, no.  Not like that.  I always sleep late.  How did you get out of the depression?  Just kind of just facing it.  I've been going to therapy for many years anyway.  Working out and stuff?  No, obviously not.  How could you ask that?  Why don't you ask him if he's fucking painted his face black?  Jesus, Ope.  He's obviously not. 
[02:32:30]  No, no.  Just to say something else.  Jesus.  I'm going to say something else.  It looks like he did lose a few pounds.  That's why I asked that.  Thanks, Ope.  Did you?  What do you think of that?  I'm not going to badmouth the idiot?  I said just to do that, three years of working out and no definition whatsoever?  But I understand.  Shut up.  By the way, I said no definition.  I said a few.  I said a few.  Not a lot, by the way.  Yeah.  You want to feel the guns?  I can look right here and I'm telling you.  I agree, actually.  I have been kind of swinging in the wind there.  Fucking working out.  But I can't stop eating. 
[02:33:00]  It's your eating habits.  I know it is.  It's not the food.  No.  So what?  So what?  You just started living your life again?  No, I still haven't started living my life, but I've been depressed when I've just been  working on certain things.  But, you know, it's a lot of stuff, you know, I mean, I hate to even talk about it because  it really is about the manifesto.  I hate to say it, but it really is.  Yeah.  You know?  And so that's been a big part of it, you know?  Is the manifesto, is it your life?  Is it some fiction?  Is it like, what's in it? 
[02:33:30]  I don't know.  It's a bunch of different things, but it's just disorganized, you know?  Like you would just wake up in the middle of the night and go, hey, let me type away  here and some ideas would just spill out of you?  Yeah.  And also my divorce was a big thing, but I didn't realize it at the time.  I forced it to happen, but you know what I mean?  Do you back up your fucking stuff on computers, stupid, or no?  Oh, boy.  What's wrong with him?  I had this vision.  This guy's opening up here.  I'll tell you what.  I had this vision of him writing for years.  Yeah.  And he's such a... 
[02:34:00]  Losing it in one power surge.  So I'm like, yeah, do you back it up?  Of course.  Okay.  Don't say of course, like you're savvy.  So you never got over the divorce?  No, but I think that affected me greatly.  Oh, why?  I'm over it because it had to be.  Ugh.  Stupid wives.  Because Colin was in love.  Oh, was that it?  Sorry.  Yeah.  He wasn't in a miserable marriage.  I was in a short marriage.  Yeah.  He wasn't married for a long time.  It was a short one.  It was a short one.  Oh, man.  But I was living on it for a while.  Do you see, like, that... 
[02:34:30]  Was it your fault, do you think?  I don't think you could find anybody in the world that could say it was anything but my  fault.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That bad.  I literally left her no choice.  It's 100%.  No choice.  If there's 100% of anything in the world...  Do you want to share it, get it off your chest or no?  Wow.  I just literally left it, like, she had no choice but to leave.  Like, what type of things were you doing that a woman would not enjoy or want to be  around or...  Well, he is the ultimate thing.  What I really did in the long run to chase her away was cheated on her and then told her, 
[02:35:00]  I'm not saying I'm going to not cheat again.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  Who do you think you're like, Gene Simmons?  That's pretty much 100%.  You know, I was waiting for the explanation of 100%.  He just nailed it.  Yeah.  There's not a better definition of 100% than that right there.  You really are forcing a person to be pushing him right out of there.  Yeah, if you would have, like, begged and said, oh, I'm sorry, I absolutely wouldn't  do this again, then you could say, all right, at least get tried.  There might be a glimmer of hope.  But when you say, you might go to therapy and figure this out together, but when you 
[02:35:30]  say...  Or if it's, like, 1973, it's me and Kevin Kline in the ice storm, you know, standing there  in our jackets, honey, it's a swinging world.  But, yeah, I just left it a choice, you know?  Wow.  And that bothers you?  Well, it bothers me because, you know, yeah, it does bother me a little bit.  Then why'd you cheat?  Well, at the time, it didn't bother me.  Oh, okay.  And then you realize that you really blew it.  And this was it.  I have to say, my work, the things I've been working on are just... 
[02:36:00]  The fact that I've written certain amounts of shows and certain amounts of movies that  don't get done, that are really, like, what should be done, and I just feel like they end  up doing crummy versions of it eventually.  It really makes me so angry about show business.  I can't even, I can't even talk about, I can't jokingly talk about the level of fury that  I feel about it.  And I know that relative to a six-year-old, like, a Sudanese child, my problems mean nothing.  To me, they're actually more important.  That's what we differ. 
[02:36:30]  But compared to the people that I know do certain things or get certain success, it just, I  can't help it.  I know it's the cliche of bitterness, but I know that my work, it all should be done.  I prove it every time I do get some things, and I just want to burn down about eight networks  and kill about 5,000 people.  Dude, same crap happens to us in this radio business, man.  It's amazing how hard they make this.  How hard they make this. 
[02:37:00]  Opie, we have a show.  Yeah, Opie, see, the one difference is, you guys have a show.  See?  Well, without getting into detail, trust me, we can relate.  Let's put it that way.  And I think what Colin needs, my opinion of Colin, because Colin told me other management  problems he had, is I think you need a fucking good manager.  That's what I think, because this stuff is really fucking good.  Colin's very funny, very smart, clever guy.  And the idea that, yeah, for years, you're throwing your stuff out there, and these fucking pieces 
[02:37:30]  of shit get on TV, get TV shows, huge tours, whatever the fuck it is.  It's like, there's no justice in the business.  But it's not like there was supposed to be, though.  But I know examples of some great stuff, though.  Who's your caddy?  The caveman series is terrific.  But I don't think that Jim's answer is correct.  I'm not going to, my answer is not getting Commander McBrague with me.  No, I'll tell you why I said that. 
[02:38:00]  Shut up and let the laugh finish.  You're right.  That's a big laugh.  My goodness, what did you do, McBrague?  Well, I pulled out a toothpick.  You know, it was during the making of License to Win, so of course we shot in Mozambique,  as you know, because there's the finest hunting in the land.  One time, Colin, shut up and let it happen.  All right, I stopped.  One time, Colin, License to Win?  What are you, trying to defend your company? 
[02:38:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Let us laugh at the shit they put out.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  I swear to God, I don't know who Commander McBrague is.  I swear to God, I don't know.  Really?  I don't know, I believe.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  But obviously, me and Colin were talking one time, and he was talking about his manager  at the time being annoying, because he's like...  Oh, he's supposed to be the manager.  But, you know, yeah.  I asked him, he's got more sense.  Whoa.  You think if I don't get my script sold, I lose $15,000?  That's right.  Oh!  Oh!  So, I fucking call 30.  In a minute, bring me to coffee.  But he was complaining about his fucking manager, and he's going, trying to get his manager 
[02:39:00]  to push harder for his scripts, and you need somebody that fucking said, this is a great  script, and it's a fucking animal, and fucking makes the calls and pushes through.  Not somebody that's fucking wishy-washy with it.  To me, that's important.  Wishy-washy.  You don't want to wishy-washy.  Yeah, I mean, it's true.  You got a wishy-washy?  Yeah.  It's the truth.  I don't have any manager or any agent right now.  Well, exactly.  For two years.  That's silly.  No, it's not.  No, guys, let me tell you something.  Please.  I would write a, I would write, I would read a Colin Quinn book. 
[02:39:30]  So, you got to find your angle.  Well, I mean, but I, I don't know.  I don't know what to do.  Do you write about pop culture?  Do you write about your life?  Do you write about stand-up?  I write about everything.  Yeah, but you got to find, like, some kind of angle.  She talks about it.  Here's what Colin's book should be.  It should be you.  Here should be the photo.  It should be you, like, sitting in front of a computer with, like, a bunch of, like,  papers piled up, and your hands in the air, like, what the hell, folks?  And the book should be called Colin Quinn, and then it should be Colin after it, HodgePodge. 
[02:40:00]  I told you that he might see that.  Oh, is that awful?  What an awful picture you've just conjured up.  HodgePodge, and he's in front of a whole bunch of papers.  We don't know what it's about, ladies and gentlemen.  See, I'll tell you.  I would throw that on the floor and step on it.  Colin, your problem is you got friends like him.  You know that, right?  I don't help.  I'm very supportive.  They don't help.  I'm a big...  They don't help.  I'm very helpful.  That's not true.  No, you're not.  Your lips are awful.  You're not helping.  Fucking burn victim lips.  How's that going to help you, Colin? 
[02:40:30]  He knows it's not.  It's irrelevant.  Not only that, but...  You hang out with the wrong crowd.  I like the HodgePodge idea with me and the turtleneck, though.  I like that.  HodgePodge.  It's a green turtleneck, and you have a red sweater vest over it, and you release it around  Christmas.  And there's, like, this tinsel around you, too.  No, you don't release it around Christmas, and I'm still worried about it.  HodgePodge, and it's hands up in the air.  When Ford is by Garrison Keillor or somebody.  HodgePodge.  HodgePodge.  It's just a mishmatch of things.  Oh, never. 
[02:41:00]  Well, I'm putting on a CD, American Gangster.  I told you.  American Gangster.  American Gangster.  It takes my...  I superimposed my picture in Denzel's face when I post it.  No, you're right.  They don't help.  So you're leaving your house more.  Are you going on the road to do a little comedy?  No, I've been on the road this whole time.  I mean...  You canceled Florida.  What was that about?  When?  Well, then we got spies everywhere.  Jesus.  I didn't cancel Florida.  Let's go to Tim in Florida.  Tim?  Hey, Colin.  Yeah, you know, I was going to sit through awful Christian Finnegan and that Rosie O'Donnell 
[02:41:30]  replacement, Caroline Ray, to see you in Lakeland, and you canceled.  No, I didn't cancel.  They canceled that gig.  Oh, did they?  That's a joke.  Yeah, sorry, yeah.  Why?  That was like last week.  Yeah, you got to come back to Florida.  They didn't cancel because of the, I guess, lack of ticket sales or something.  Did you guys go on the radio and promote?  You got to get out there.  Shut your mouth, stupid.  There really is no support base with the people that you know and hang out with.  The comics are the worst. 
[02:42:00]  They are the worst.  No, we're not.  No, you're terrible.  And the truth is, I was always very, you know, too supportive of all of them.  You should move and change your name.  I'm done with that.  Move and change your name.  What?  You think so?  Yeah.  Get away from these guys.  Well, I actually have an idea for a name that's kind of hip.  Ken Fresno.  That's good.  What are you going to do?  Weather?  Pretty good.  I don't know if there's a good action here on that.  Ken Fresno.  Ken Fresno.  That is instantly a new name on the message board.  Ken Fresno.  And now with your five-day forecast, it's Ken Fresno. 
[02:42:30]  Well, he had names for me and Voss, too.  Yeah.  Like, what the names we should tour under.  And mine was Little Pete Ferguson.  This was Little Pete Ferguson.  And Voss was, is this the perfect name for Voss?  Ronnie Garcia.  But he has to go to the rat tail back.  He has to go to the rat tail back.  And I had names for Keith.  What the hell is Keith?  Well, yeah.  Stucks with an N.  It's one word.  You've got to leave this negativity behind.  Yeah, and what do you mean you've been too supportive of Voss? 
[02:43:00]  We're all supportive of you.  What are you talking about?  Shut up.  Every interview I do, I talk about you.  Shh.  No, I won't shush.  I'm going to finish my point.  That's what Voss says.  I support you on every radio.  Shut up.  What's Voss?  No one listens to Voss.  No one can understand him.  There's no...  I don't care that you say positive things.  You know what I mean when you're...  Positive things?  You fucking mumbling.  Fuckknuckle in, you know, Butte, Montana, doing your shitty gig.  Positive things?  Fucking...  This is...  This is not helping him, Jimmy.  Listen to the two of them. 
[02:43:30]  They're both...  This guy was hanging off a railing 36 stories up.  I know.  This is not helping.  Those fucking awful sea bass stomach fish hands.  By the way...  Oh, shit.  By the way...  You fucking little fishy sea bass belly hands make me sick.  They're just...  They're awful to each other.  Yeah.  That doesn't help that.  You two are horrible to each other.  And you know what Jerry Springer says every day?  Be nice to each other.  Yeah.  He really does.  That redeems the whole show as far as...  That's of course.  Be nice to each other.  Makes up for the fighting.  How about this?  How about...  This is going to be a challenge for both of you.  How about you say something nice about each other?  Who wants to start? 
[02:44:00]  We say plenty of nice things about each other.  We say lots of nice things.  We certainly do.  All right.  How about what?  Colin, why don't you start?  Something nice about Jimmy.  Sincere.  I thought that Jim's last HBO special was even funnier when he did the...  When he did it...  You know, the first HBO special was funny.  The second one he just did was even funnier when he did the same thing the second time.  No, that's not true. 
[02:44:30]  I didn't see...  I didn't see...  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  See, they can't do it.  No, that's not true.  They can't do it.  I want to say something nice to Colin.  All right.  One nice thing, Jimmy.  I saw your first HBO special and...  Oh, wait.  There was no second one.  All right.  I better move on.  See?  But I know he was trying to say something nice because halfway through he realized it.  He goes, oh, wait.  These guys are scared to show real feelings. 
[02:45:00]  That's not true.  We do all the time.  All right.  Then, Colin, back to you.  One nice thing about Jimmy.  We're going to get this done today.  Okay.  That Jimmy doesn't have AIDS after all the sexual encounters.  And I'll say this.  If Colin was killed in a fire, I would be bothered.  See?  I'll say this.  They hide behind their laughter.  These guys can't show a real...  If Jimmy is killed in an uprising during one of his management meetings... 
[02:45:30]  Okay?  In Paraguay.  Paraguay of all places.  The great white hunter with Buana.  His agent Buana.  Oh, you too.  That's not true.  I think that we say a lot of nice things.  I just think comics are really incapable of sharing sincere emotion with each other without  having to throw in a buzzword zinger.  You'd be surprised what Jimmy Tozoa is capable of emotion-wise. 
[02:46:00]  Jimmy Tozoa.  Equating him with some type of sperm.  I believe.  Yes, yes, yes.  I bet you this is like that.  Jim sleeps in a Petri dish.  I honestly think that these guys cannot do it.  That's not true.  Well, let's take away.  What have we told you and Anthony to do it?  Exactly.  I've said it all the time.  What do you say?  I love you, man.  Like a Budweiser commercial. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  It's got to be like the punch on the arm.  You can never just be sweet.  We've definitely said nice things about each other.  Yeah.  On the air.  You guys cannot do it on the air.  Sure we can.  Jimmy, Colin, back to you.  One nice thing about Jimmy.  And then we can go back to trashing each other.  Jimmy is a very, very smart, funny comic.  And really brought a new whole new refreshing, you know, mindset to comedy.  Oh, stop there. 
[02:47:00]  Stop there.  I know you're chomping.  I'm not chomping.  He's chomping.  And I will say something nice about Colin.  He is perceptive.  And he is good at speaking the truth about funny guys.  Come on.  How many good things?  I love Colin.  He's the funniest guy I know.  I fucking said that a million times.  Colin is playing along, Jimmy.  Come on.  This will help Colin Quinn.  He's in deep depression here.  But Colin knows that.  He's in deep depression.  There's not an interview I do, regardless of the size of the paper, where I don't say, 
[02:47:30]  when they say about comedy and stuff, I say Colin's the funniest guy in the business.  I always say that.  He's the guy that makes me laugh.  I've read that.  He makes me laugh harder than anybody else do in stand-up comedy.  I've never read that.  I've never read that all the time.  Now I've got to say this.  I hate you guys because you ruined our bit.  We could continue with this for another 10 minutes.  We wasted a lot of time on this.  It's going to be fucking vile again.  I mean, it's going to be a love fest.  I'm looking at his hands.  I want to fucking bite them.  What's wrong with my hands? 
[02:48:00]  They're fucking horrendous.  In the break, we said this because he was giving me the finger and that fucking liver  spotted foot he holds up out of his sleeve.  It looks like fucking olive loaf.  I want to put your fucking hand between two pieces of white bread and watch Fat Bob Kelly  eat it in a plastic baggie.  See, they had to go back into the safe zone.  Yeah.  I hope people are really listening to this.  How like it's so uncomfortable for them to say something nice that they have to get  right back into trash.  It was awkward and uncomfortable when they had to compliment each other. 
[02:48:30]  So they have to go right back.  And now it's all just going back to it.  It's all fun.  Maybe Jim was, but I was happy to just sit here and say my great guy.  I never left it.  It was only on pause while I said something nice.  All I do is hit play again.  Of course we're going to say awful things about each other.  But Colin, I don't think it was right that Bob Kelly got dragged into it about the pimento  loaf.  Neither did I.  I pulled my back out and I pulled that pig anywhere.  All right. 
[02:49:00]  That's just ignorant, but he's supposed to slice those things.  See, this is very healthy for Colin.  This is a very healthy hour for Colin.  I want to somehow see or read this manifesto.  I want to see it on TV or in the movies or whatever the hell you're going to do with it.  I think it's going to be like, you know, Colin, you can take a break from show business.  This is what you do.  You get a break.  What do you mean you can take a break from show business?  Oh, man. 
[02:49:30]  Sign your book deal.  Get a fucking book out there.  Promote the shit out of it.  But promote the shit out of it.  Do book signings.  It'll be a great experience for you.  Because I'm not like some of these guys that just, you know, you constantly see them pushing  their books and their dumb CDs and their specials, constantly doing every stupid thing.  They'll do a line in a shitty big action movie.  Just, you know, I'm not like that.  Absolutely not.  But you got to promote work.  They'll be in Spider-Man 5.  They don't give a damn.  I'm trying to do real work.  Well, we don't all have Crocodile Dundee 2 to fall back on. 
[02:50:00]  I'm saying that.  That's fucking like I had.  If he kills himself today, it's going to be on your head.  I'm going to hope you're right.  It's going to be on your head, Jimmy.  I didn't mean it.  No, that was messed up.  That was a Paul Hogan story.  You don't like self-promoting, do you?  Why?  No, that's not the point.  Would you have had that?  Why don't you like self-promoting, Kyle?  No, it's not a question of self-promoting.  But it's part of your thing.  Like, you got to tell people where you are.  No, I just can't organize.  No, I have no problem with that.  I look.  Stand-up-wise, I have no problem with self-promoting. 
[02:50:30]  I'm just saying right now, getting all my other stuff together is very, it's out of control.  I mean, I don't know what else to say.  It's all these papers and these fucking files.  You need organization somehow.  I need to so I can get it out.  Colin's too mean.  That's the problem.  It's in the computer and it's in everything.  It's hard, you know?  If someone tries to help Colin, he'll give you, hey, man, I know somebody who can help  you organize and back stuff up.  He'll go, shut your mouth.  That's not what it is.  Nobody ever, believe me, he's making it up now.  I've never said to me, hey, Kyle, I know something.  Well, I never knew it until now.  I didn't know you had a whole pile of papers, you fucking psycho. 
[02:51:00]  I didn't know you were sitting there like a fucking pack rat.  You got a very protective wall around you, Colin.  Exactly.  And it's made of blubber.  I remember one time trying to have a moment with him.  I'm like, you know, you haven't been on the show in a while.  Why don't you come in and, you know, do our show?  And he goes, shut up.  Like, all right.  Have a good day.  Hey, Colin, where have you been?  Shut your mouth.  Right.  In case I'm a blackout, I'm going to put a wick in you and light it. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, fuck.  What does that mean?  He's implying that like a whale, you would have some type of blubber that would be workable  in a lamp.  Like lamp oil.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  But no, I knew you wrote, but I didn't know you had a pile of papers that was disorganized.  You just said that.  I said you've been writing for two years.  Yeah.  I've been writing for a long time.  Wow.  Thanks.  But, you know, I'll do what I do.  I don't know. 
[02:52:00]  It's hard to get it organized.  That's all I know.  And then to get it out there somehow.  Yeah.  Somehow get it out there.  But it's mostly the organization.  You know, it's like.  Yeah.  Everything's like finished, but it's like first draft.  And I just, you know.  All right.  Let's go to Lonnie.  So why don't you have somebody.  Hold on.  Why don't you have somebody go through your computer?  Honestly.  Is it all on the computer?  Yeah.  But I'm telling you, it's thousands and thousands of pages of shit.  So have somebody.  Here's what you do.  You back it up onto a fucking.  Here's how simple this is.  You buy an external drive from Mac.  A Lacey drive.  I'll help you hook it up.  Bob Kelly would probably be more qualified to. 
[02:52:30]  Probably.  All right.  He would be.  You have somebody on a backup drive.  So you don't have to do it.  They don't have to be fucking with your computer.  Take everything and somehow organize it.  If it takes them a month, it takes them a month.  But have them do it the best they can.  And there are people who will be able to do it through word searches and stuff.  Fucking organize your stuff a lot faster than you can.  If you're going to use that kind of profanity, I don't want to be invited.  I don't mean to.  But that's good, though.  Right now, you're putting fucking sausages on a bagel.  With egg yolk.  Let's go to Ralph in North Carolina. 
[02:53:00]  It's Lonnie.  If you should see what he's eating right now, why don't you just fucking. . .  I had no reference.  All right.  So I bailed out.  Lonnie.  It was a heart attack reference.  And then I realized, why don't you just. . .  Good.  Hold on.  Stupid is eating a fucking open-faced bagel with eggs dripping in yolks and a fucking sausage.  And as he tipped it, the egg fell onto his hand.  And I couldn't be happier.  That was a safe.  What's up, Lonnie?  He's just filling up loneliness.  Jimmy.  Yes.  I can't take these two. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, do you and Colin live together?  Because you sound like an old married couple.  No, we don't.  Y'all guys should live together.  Y'all. . .  Well, this is how we interact.  This is why Colin's a piece of shit.  I'm talking to him.  I'm having a heartfelt talk to him.  Because I did the Gene Simmons roast.  And I never hired anybody to write for me before.  But I'm like, you know what?  There's a lot of comedians on the roast.  I wanted to get the perspective of a comic.  And fucking. . .  I'll pay him.  I don't know how much to pay.  My friend Kurt.  Stupid Kurt.  Gives me two pages.  Like one the day before and the one the day of. 
[02:54:00]  Fucking lazy Kurt.  So fucking. . . .  They were funny jokes, though.  So I get them.  And I'm like, Colin.  Like, I'm talking to him about it.  And on the elevator, he goes, you know, I don't want to humiliate you in front of everybody.  But I've never hired anybody to write for me.  Wow.  In front of the whole elevator.  I had to justify myself.  So I tried to have like a nice. . .  Ask a guy who's been around for years to fucking help me out with a piece of advice.  Get me out of here, Hendry.  Hendry.  I've been around for years on my own two feet.  Not Kurt's.  Hmm.  That's true.  Kurt's. 
[02:54:30]  My buddy. . . .  Kurt.  Kurt Metzger.  He's a funny writer.  Oh.  He's a funny comic.  All right.  Let's go to James in Jersey.  But as Carl says, he looks like a Bosnian war criminal.  That could be the best slam I've heard about a comic.  It's true.  He really is horrendous.  He fucking called him a Bosnian war criminal.  And he has a big head with short, awful black hair.  He's truly awful.  He sends shivers up people's spines when he goes on stage.  Look, they're working together now.  This is good.  This is good.  See?  Because they have a common enemy for a second or two.  Let's go to James in Jersey.  James.  Holy. . .  Where the fuck did Kenny get this omelet? 
[02:55:00]  He's right behind him.  Now Kenny gets dragged into the . . .  Did Heather Mills leave this on the kitchen floor?  Oh, fuck.  Do you want another one?  I'll go back.  It's okay.  Where's the ketchup?  Am I supposed to fucking do bleed onto it?  Where's the ketchup?  Kenny, you got my . . .  Hold on a second.  Jimmy really is like La Mata.  I'm not like La Mata because I want ketchup.  I'm like Lenny from Mice and Men.  I'm supposed to bleed onto it.  I want fucking ketchup.  Tell him about the message I gave you.  I text messaged you and Kenny after your special, stupid. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, so. . .  He said that the worst part of me shooting a special  is that me and Kenny were probably sitting there together  like having a serious moment.  Afterwards, they're just like . . .  Yeah.  Looking at each other.  Well, don't tell me to tell and then fucking jump in and interrupt me.  Why didn't you want to ruin it?  I'm not ruining it.  Fucking . . .  Just have the stroke while you're eating that.  You've never seen anybody have a worse fucking meal  than he is right now.  Just give me . . .  Fucking gulls are more polite than you are eating that.  Fucking . . .  You should be circling a garbage scout. 
[02:56:00]  Fucking cunt.  I almost had him on the same page yet.  I almost had him.  Colin, just give me . . .  Just leave me the password to your computer  so I can make you famous in your . . .  In your death.  Yeah, posthumously.  Yeah, posthumously.  Hey, James Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Colin.  I was wondering if you were really bitter or upset  when you got . . .  when you threw Weekend Update on Saturday Live 
[02:56:30]  and they replaced you.  I wonder if that really depressed you  or that really bothered you when that happened.  Well, yeah.  I mean, that bothered . . .  I just saw a picture card.  Yeah, that pissed me off, too.  Okay, no, I thought you were pretty good.  I mean, Norm Macdonald was great at it.  Yeah.  And I remember being really upset  when they fired him.  I thought that was total crap.  Yeah.  I like the way you said to Colin,  you were pretty good.  And I remember Norm Macdonald was great.  Yeah, yeah.  Why kick a guy while he's down?  Yeah, that's not going to help Colin today  by saying that, sir.  Oh, all right. 
[02:57:00]  Okay, thanks, guys.  So, Colin, hold on.  Colin, what he said to me in the message  was very funny.  He texted me.  He said the worst part is that me and Kenny  were probably sitting there after the thing.  And do you want to say what you did?  Because I probably, I will fucking butcher the quote,  but it was very funny.  Now he tells them to tell him.  Why did you wait for him to have a mouthful of food?  Well, no, because it made you really tough for him.  When I get to wake up at 3 in the morning  and he finally falls asleep.  I said they sat in the dressing room 
[02:57:30]  and we put glasses together and he goes,  hey, man, we did it.  Can you redo that as, what was his name?  Ken Fresno?  Ken Fresno.  Ken Fresno.  Ken Fresno.  Ken Fresno.  My other character in action movie is Rick Lucite.  Dude, do you know how you had,  if that is what I think it is,  I'm going to fucking,  I'm going to spit on you.  Oh, shit.  What?  Okay, let's not.  What, what? 
[02:58:00]  I thought, I saw something right on top of the microphone.  I said, if he got fucking ketchup on top of the microphone,  I'm going to fucking spit on him.  But he didn't.  Let's say hi to Keith and Louis.  Oh, thank God.  Louisville.  Kenny Fresno needs a catchphrase.  Yeah.  Kenny Fresno would have to say his name on stage.  Hey, Colin, I really love that show you had on Comedy Central  where you used to bring Bob Kelly and all of them on.  Whatever, how did that, why'd that end all of a sudden?  And I thought it'd be better if you guys got it on like HBO 
[02:58:30]  where you could, you know, get a little more raw language.  It would have been, but HBO didn't want to do it.  Oh.  They don't like, a lot of people don't like the agenda that we bring.  Well, the other thing was I couldn't figure out  why they couldn't afford to get you a chair.  You always were half cocked on that desk.  Like when you'd lean against the pool table or something.  So these idiots could slam my awful legs.  Yeah.  That was a crime that that show got canceled.  Yes, it was. 
[02:59:00]  It was disgusting.  Oh, my God.  That's me and Kyle.  That is the worst.  Just eating.  That was awful that that got taken off.  There's no, no reason for it.  No reason.  You know what's funny?  There was a political reason.  Well, also, we got some complaints because I think it's,  they were rerunning us the next day at seven.  And then the Daily Show, they were rerunning at seven thirty.  And I think in that, and again, the Daily Show was a bigger show. 
[02:59:30]  But our ratings were actually higher than the Daily Show in those reruns.  And again, I'm not saying the tough crowd was bigger than the Daily Show,  but it was fucking a very watched show.  Yeah, it was.  And they got some complaints about content, and they yanked it.  And me and Penn, we had that argument a few weeks ago.  Yeah.  Where he was talking about Bill Donnie and the Catholic League.  And he was going, the things they did to Matt and Trey, like in South Park.  But what that made me think of is,  Comedy Central proved that when you back a show,  like they've backed South Park, 
[03:00:00]  and you stand up against that bullshit,  the fuck, it's the biggest show they've ever had.  And they've gotten complaints,  they've gotten protests.  Threats of boycotts.  Yeah.  And it's the biggest show they ever had because the network stood behind it.  So that's, I guess, the point I'm making.  They didn't like the idea that you discussed race.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, Chappelle's show,  which was, you know,  they were ready to just back a fucking tanker full of money over to him.  Uh, that was nothing but racial humor. 
[03:00:30]  Well, I mean, that's the whole, everybody knows,  everybody in the country knows that white people are not supposed to discuss race  except from the point of apologizing.  Yeah.  Or else you're racist.  And everybody knows that's the way it is.  Yeah.  Or else you're racist.  That's just the way it is.  If you do anything but that, everybody has a heart attack.  You've got to apologize.  Especially all the white people.  Yeah.  And that's just the way it is.  But nobody will really admit it completely.  Or they'll go, well, it's too bad, it's payback.  You know, it's just a fact.  Payback.  Yeah.  Well, there's a little pushback happening with Imus getting back on radio. 
[03:01:00]  I don't know.  Some of those remarks he made were salty.  I heard one of those girls was scarred for life.  Yes.  And then I saw her iPod and I saw the playlist.  I noticed a couple of songs that might be a little saltier.  Yeah.  A little young cheesy number called Take My 12 Gauge and Tear.  You know.  I mean, it's so pathetic.  That even they have these girls being phony and going, I was scarred.  But, you know.  Dude, we've talked about the Imus situation, I mean, off and on for, what, the last six months? 
[03:01:30]  And I even went down the road with Jimmy.  I'm like, all right, let's try to see it the other way.  Let's just sit here and try to see it the fucking other way.  All right.  So he got in at 10 o'clock that day instead of 6.  No, it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't.  Great line.  Great line.  Stupid me still trying to make my point.  But it's very good, Colin.  A cup of tea with eight sugars later.  Right.  Bravo. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah, so go ahead.  I hope you enjoyed the bounce pass.  But this is interesting to see it the other way.  I'm not even kidding, but go ahead.  But, yeah, Jimmy and I, I think, we were in a cab on the way home.  Like, let's just try to see it the other way.  And it just still bothers me.  I can't see it their way whatsoever.  Could not wrap my head around it at all.  Like, even to play devil's advocate, I just could not.  To get kicked off a radio show for saying nappy-headed hoe, it just amazes me.  It amazes me.  But good thing is, though.  It doesn't amaze me.  Go ahead.  Good thing is he got rehired. 
[03:02:30]  And the bottom line, it's a great fucking thing that he got rehired.  Because people go, oh, so now we're going to have to deal with him on the other side.  It was a terrible move.  You know what he did in the end?  He helped the Rutgers women's basketball team program.  Because there was an article a couple weeks ago that recruiting has never been better for that school.  Because of what Imus said, he actually helped their program.  In the end, it was a massive positive thing for the school and every single person that was on that team,  including the coaches and the stupid mop lady.  And all the fucking floor after the game's over. 
[03:03:00]  And they got nice hats for all the girls so you can't see their hair.  I just can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  This is what's been happening now, you know?  This is the climate that's never discussed.  Did you see a few excerpts from the Pat Buchanan book about how the country is?  Come on, John.  This is ridiculous.  I'm not a joke around.  Oh, John.  This country is just pretty much done as one of the great empires of the earth that is pretty much on the downswing. 
[03:03:30]  Well, me and philosopher Nick DiPaolo were talking about this yesterday.  And what Nick DiPaolo actually said, which is true, is Pat Buchanan, one thing, whatever people think about him,  he has hit the mark.  And he's been the most predicted, the most things in the past 20 years that were kind of happened in the country.  He says, with the dollar at an all-time low, foreign countries looking to get off the whole dollar.  They're looking to pick up on the euro. 
[03:04:00]  China owning half of our country.  The housing market just in the shitter.  And then the invasion from Mexico that's happening.  But this sounds like one of those things where you're like this.  Ready?  Yeah.  I'd like to read something to you, Anthony.  Foreigners are invading our land.  The economy is at an all-time low.  There's crime everywhere.  That was written in 1840.  Oh, yes, yes.  And if you look, that was written by Abraham Lincoln. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  And we still went on to blah, blah, blah.  But, yeah, no, but I do think there's, well, I mean, I don't know what's going to happen with the actual country,  but it's like that, just the phoniness of what we're talking about, the lack of discussing anything,  the triple-double standards that go on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you know what?  It's not just white people anymore that are getting it, but black people don't get it from whites.  They get shit from other minority groups.  Like, the Asian groups, because there have been black DJs fired, like Donnell Rollins got fired for something he said. 
[03:05:00]  There's been other black guys that get a lot of shit, but they never get it from white people,  because white people still feel paternalistic.  They get it from fucking Asian groups who don't give a shit,  and they deal with racism from blacks in the neighborhoods,  having to fucking have them scream about more duck sauce than fucking the Korean delis.  They do.  They deal with racism from blacks all the time, so they've had it up to here.  They don't give a shit.  They don't feel any guilt.  I feel sorry for your mother.  Yo, Jet Li.  Oh, what'd you say?  Yo, Jet Li.  But the only people that don't call me.  Jet Li.  Where do you keep the cold beer, poppy? 
[03:05:30]  Yo, Jet Li.  I was at the Gene Simmons roast.  Carrot Top was one of the roasters,  and I think RZA from Wu-Tang was there.  This was backstage, and he was trying to talk to Carrot Top,  and he goes,  Yo, Carrot Head.  It really made me laugh.  Yo, Carrot Head.  Did Carrot Head use any of those muscles of his?  No, he was just...  To fight back?  Of course not.  He was fucking funny on the road,  so I'll tell you that one.  Yeah.  Carrot Top was...  Yeah, he was really funny.  Yeah, what am I saying?  He was really cool on our show.  Yeah.  He was funny and nice. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, he was great.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Colin Quinn in studio playing Gotham Comedy Club.  An amazing comic.  Yeah.  An amazing, depressed comic.  He's insightful.  That's the best comic to see by you.  I'll tell you one thing about Opie.  That son of a bitch has always come to see me.  And Anthony actually showed up once,  but he had to sit right behind my aunt, remember?  Yes.  Somebody badged Anthony,  because Opie always came,  and then Anthony's in right behind my cousin.  She's like,  Honey, isn't he the greatest?  She's grabbing him to the hotel.  That's cool.  I fucked her.  I'm teasing, of course. 
[03:06:30]  I remember back in the day  when we met you for the first time,  you were on the way to bet the horses,  and every time we saw it after that  was you betting horses.  OTB.  And he was worried about us giving the tip out  because he didn't want the odds going down that day.  Oh, remember?  Yeah.  You were like,  I got a great tip from my uncle or whatever it was.  My cousin Dillard.  Cousin.  And you were running to OTB.  It was such a great tip.  And you're like,  fuck,  I just told the biggest assholes in New York radio  this great tip.  And you were panicking that  we were going to go on the air that day.  The odds were going to drop your spot  and make it a three-to-one on your life. 
[03:07:00]  But actually,  they closed that OTB, too, you know.  Why?  Around the corner of your house?  Why?  Ninth Avenue is really booming, Jim.  I mean,  you should go out there and try to invest.  You're right there.  Bye.  Take a brief walk on a Sunday  after Lincoln Center,  you cock sucker.  And then you were trying to drag us  into that world with you.  Come on.  Come on.  You guys wanted to bet.  I love that.  Come on.  Let's go on.  Let's go on.  If these family bets,  the trotters,  they'd probably go to the dog track.  We did a gig at a dog track. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  We had protesters.  We had protesters outside.  We were just trying to make  an extra hundred bucks  because we were making no money in radio.  And on the weekend,  we're like,  could you guys do an appearance  at the dog track?  We're like, yeah, whatever.  How much?  It was like $100 to $200 each.  We're like, cool.  That's some nice drinking money, right?  We show up.  There's a massive protest going on  with our names on the side.  We're like, what the fuck?  Yeah, thanks.  What the fuck did we do?  Actually, Jim's working  a dogfight this weekend.  We just wanted to talk 
[03:08:00]  dogfighting association.  No, that's New Year's Eve.  It's an 8 o'clock show.  Oh, my God.  It's the old Westbury Music Fair.  If you want tickets,  you go to Ticketmaster  tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.  It goes on sale.  There you go.  See?  We just wanted to throw  t-shirts out,  you know,  collect a couple hundred bucks,  and we're dealing  with fucking protesters.  Protesters.  Like, throwing shit  at our cores and stuff.  You animal haters.  The dogs.  And they're showing, like,  they have signs with pictures  of greyhounds  with big open wounds on them.  Yeah, those aren't  the dog track dogs.  No, they're healthy. 
[03:08:30]  Is there any strategy  to when they can't run anymore?  I think you have to speak  to Cesar Millan.  How could there possibly  be strategy?  They all look the same  and they run the same.  By the way,  I saw the dog  Cesar Millan last night.  I watched an episode  of Denise Richards.  She looked pretty good.  Denise Richards is a psycho.  She didn't seem crazy  on that dog show.  She seemed very normal.  She is a psycho, man.  The shit I'm reading about her.  Why?  I'm going to piss.  Are you gossiping?  Why is she a psycho?  You're a little gossip.  I want to hear about this.  Well, we can after the break. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  Since Jim Rudeau  has interrupted us,  I'm going to piss.  He's going to piss, too.  That's why I'm going to break.  I'm holding my phone really up.  Charlie Sheen.  It's like having La Mata  in the studio.  I'm going to piss.  Well, I do.  And you're like having  La Mata in studio  by looking at you  at the end of it.  Hey, ladies and gentlemen.  You know, a joke certainly  needs to help  when you have to add  two endings to it  by looking at it.  I'll tell you this, mister.  The end of it.  All right.  Fair enough.  You forced me  to make a comeback, Colin.  Fuck you. 
[03:09:30]  And the horse  you rode in on.  We had you guys  in a good place.  And the whole cavalry  behind you.  I tried, Colin.  And they had her on tour  where they all hated her.  Emma, 48.  All that bullshit.  They all hated her.  That's her intro.  I think it was  Emma, 48.  After she was on a big tour  they all hated her.  Hey, I said,  where's the toilet?  He said, you're in it.  Let's go.  Funny guy.  That's why I'm here. 
[03:10:00]  That's his comeback.  Funny guy.  That's why I'm here.  He was horrible.  The greatest.  Know who said  he hasn't watched  Raging Bull ever?  I do kind of.  A friend of the show.  Real good friend of the show.  Who?  Let me think.  Patrice.  Patrice.  Oh, he's never seen it?  He'd like it.  Of course he wouldn't.  He calls it one of those  white guy movies  that he's never seen.  Exactly what it is.  He knows white guy culture, though.  He's pretty smart about that.  Wait, black guys 
[03:10:30]  wouldn't enjoy Raging Bull?  Why not?  Because they're hateful white people  who start to overshadow  all their normal behavior.  Just sheer hatred  for white people  overshadow any...  That's why Patrice  doesn't like Raging Bull.  Is there really movies  that black guys like  better than white guys?  Besides,  I don't know,  I was going to say  besides the author.  Of course.  Are you kidding me?  Jesus.  Like what, though?  Like, I guess what I'm trying  to say is Raging Bull  seems like it's such  a great movie  that white, black, blue  who gives a fuck  would like that movie.  How's that? 
[03:11:00]  They give a fuck.  And when I say they,  I mean black guys  who give a fuck.  Is there black movies  that are really good  that white guys  refuse to watch?  Yeah.  Like what?  That fucking Tyler Perry shit.  I don't know  one motherfucking white guy  that would go see that crap  and it's not grossing shit  every time.  But that wasn't up  for an Oscar.  Let's go down that.  Oscar.  Raging Bull won.  I mean, not Best Picture.  But that's what I'm saying.  It was up for a million awards.  I'm talking about a movie  that was so obviously good  by all the critics  and all that,  but blacks refuse  to see it for whatever reason. 
[03:11:30]  I wonder if there's  a black movie  that white guys  are like, fuck that.  What do you call this?  The Irv Gotti Show  on VH1.  Oh, it's thinking.  It's good at this shit.  I'm just trying to think  like you got something  like Training Day,  but that's not a black cast.  It's like Raging Bull  is a white.  Raging Bull's a white cast.  Yeah.  You're looking for a movie  that was like Oscar worthy  with a majority.  Malcolm X.  A lot of white people  probably saw it,  but a lot more  probably didn't see it  than saw it  considering the fact  it had Denzel Washington 
[03:12:00]  and it was as high profile  a film as it was.  Get on the bus.  How about Get on the Bus?  I ain't seeing  Get on the Bus.  Let's Get on the Bus.  That was Spike Lee's movie  about the Million Man March.  Okay.  That was Get on the Bus.  Shut up.  It was good.  I liked it.  Oh, sorry.  I thought I was calling  for a second.  Spike Lee is good.  Spike Lee is a fucking  great director, man.  Okay, now I will say it.  Yes, why?  Shut up.  No, he's a great director.  Shut up.  God, you're so stupid.  No, man.  He's a great director.  He stinks.  He's very good.  All he's got in his brain. 
[03:12:30]  No, he's made  two good movies  his whole life.  Which is what?  I love Get on the Bus,  by the way.  The one scene  where he goes,  they explain to Richard Bell  how the white people  in the civil rights movement  really were not legitimate  and it didn't matter.  No, no, I'm not talking about that.  I'm not talking about his point of view.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't remember.  Point of view is not part  of a great director?  What is he?  Great camera angles?  No.  You know nothing?  No.  Shut your mouth, Colin.  I like his directing.  I like his directing very much.  Point of view is not part  of a directing?  I thought it was  the most important part.  No, because his point of view  is shitty, that's fine.  Go piss.  No, he can have  a shitty point of view.  You have a shitty point of view. 
[03:13:00]  That's true, but...  That's not true.  He can have a shitty point of view.  It doesn't mean he's  film school fucking amateur  was how animated he is.  Why?  Because he takes the dolly  and pushes it on people's face?  No, I actually don't like that.  Go piss, you know nothing.  No, school days.  When they're walking  and they're floating  through the air,  I hate that.  Get him out of here,  fucking hell.  I like Spike.  I like him.  I've always liked him.  I've liked him fucking  since we played  Mars Blackman.  I like the fucking 
[03:13:30]  the first one he did  about Nola Darley.  What the fuck  was that movie called?  She's Gotta Have It.  That was a fucking  an inventive.  Please get him out.  No, he's wrong.  I'm not even gonna look at him.  And these guys  like each other, by the way.  I just want to remind  the listeners.  Honestly, I don't like  Jim right now.  I happen to like  Spike Lee's director  very much.  I don't like Jim right now.  I'm being very honest.  Believe it or not.  Because he doesn't like  that I like Spike Lee.  Are you up for a Spike Lee movie?  I've never been.  No.  I met him once  and he was kind of  douchey to me, actually.  I like Patrice O'Neal  because Patrice O'Neal  Spike Lee was like  saying, hey man, 
[03:14:00]  give me a call.  He's like, yeah man,  call my agent.  And he like totally  sabotaged himself  with Spike Lee.  And Spike called him personally  because Spike liked Patrice.  That's why I love  the guy over and over.  Yeah.  And Patrice is so stupid.  Spike is like trying to  He's not stupid.  He's great because  he's a sabotaging comedian.  He's like, fuck you.  Well, sabotaging, yes.  But Spike is like,  look, I really want you  to be on hold  for this movie.  And Patrice was like  trying to go out  for pilot season  and Spike just went,  all right then.  No.  Patrice wasn't trying  to go out for pilot season.  He wanted to be available,  I think.  Patrice just doesn't like 
[03:14:30]  people trying to get  cocky with him  and that's what's beautiful.  And help him.  Patrice doesn't like  help and niceness.  Well,  I've got a couple more  that are sitting  right in this room.  You don't like help  or niceness.  I like help.  I like help.  I hope he's going to  get my passport  and fix my manifesto.  I'm going to make you  famous after your death.  That's my new goal.  Colin's very famous.  He's just,  he is.  I'll have my name  on the book though.  That'd be cool.  Colin, you walk down  the streets of Manhattan  on a daily basis.  How many people 
[03:15:00]  come up to you?  It's got to be  a fuckload of people  come up to you  and say,  Colin,  what are you doing?  What's going on?  Yeah.  What happened to you?  Oh my God.  You are the freak.  What happened to you?  Yeah.  People go,  what are you up to,  man?  Why aren't you doing nothing?  I didn't mean that,  stupid.  I just meant  because you're fat.  I wasn't insulting  your work.  I was insulting  your physical presence.  Goddamn.  I fucking love  these guys.  I think I have  to give up.  I tried for you,  guys.  I tried today,  buddy. 
[03:15:30]  Let's say hi  to Tony in Pittsburgh.  Tony.  Malcolm X  was a very good movie.  What happened to the break?  You're like Malcolm X?  What happened to the piss?  I don't know.  What was the two good movies?  I'm going to say  do the right thing.  I'm not talking to him  again about the subject.  This is true.  I really might.  Hold on.  I want to move on.  This is true.  Tony in Pittsburgh.  Okay.  Look at that.  Teddy, maybe.  All right, whatever.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Whatever.  Hey, a fucking  white movie  that black people love,  Scarface.  Yep.  Yep.  They love it.  Scarface.  They really do. 
[03:16:00]  Great.  Scarface just  doesn't work anymore.  Yeah, it's got  the music  and the sound  is really bad.  How about the fucking montage?  Take it to the limit.  Take it to the limit.  Awful montage.  Yeah.  The music's awful.  The blood is awful.  All the special effects  are awful.  Yeah, the sound  of the gunfire  is horrid.  Is it bad?  Yeah, really bad.  It's really bad.  You've got to remix  that movie or something.  Now the leg, eh?  My fucking manager  knows that guy.  He's like a piano player.  Yes, he does.  He's like a piano player.  The guy who played Hector.  No, I don't know.  No, David.  The other one. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, sorry.  His name is Hector.  He's like a fucking  classical musician.  The guy who played  the fucking guy.  We will paint him  back in space, Tony.  The guy who fell  on his fucking,  his stupid,  his fell on his own  chainsaw,  that silly goose.  You call me a liar, Frank?  Oh, yeah.  Mel Bernstein.  Ah!  Yeah.  All right.  We can fix that.  Yeah.  Like, even after he's shot,  he's thinking,  all right.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Can't kill a cop.  When he fucking goes,  and we'd like to go to a,  maybe you could throw it  every month.  Yeah, yeah.  Every month.  And we'd like to go  take the little lady 
[03:17:00]  to England.  Two tickets,  first class.  Smile more, Tony.  Every day above ground  is a good one.  After Frank gets shot  and the cop's sitting there  just like,  hey, Tony,  you know how it is.  I told him.  Don't make no sense  killing you.  Oh, fuck.  Bucked up.  Yeah.  There you go.  Woo, here it is.  The montage.  Nice.  It's a montage.  Mantis.  Nice.  They're fucking dealing.  Money's being counted.  Take it to the limit.  Buying cars and tigers.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Great shit.  The world is yours.  Yes.  And he buys that fucking,  what was she,  Jewish?  The one who played  his Cuban sister?  Yeah.  With that fucking  poofy hairdo.  Fucking Sam Afro.  Isabella Rossellini.  No, it wasn't.  No, it's not.  No, Anna Maria Albregetti.  Oh, okay.  No, I don't mind that one.  Whatever.  Yeah, she was in  something else.  Wait, I like Michelle.  What was her name?  What was her name?  Well, hold on.  I'm going to confide.  Michelle Pfeiffer was never better.  She goes,  I don't know if there's a nanny,  I guess.  Who does this song, 
[03:18:00]  by the way?  That voice sounded really familiar  from every fucking movie  that was in the 80s.  It sounded like Survivor,  but it's not Survivor.  Who was it?  I'll forget it.  Yeah, Michelle Pfeiffer  was fucking great.  The Babylon Club  again, Frank.  What a cunt.  Fucking cunt.  She did nothing  but do coke  and sleep all day  and she was criticizing  where the guy  wanted to go have a burger.  Maybe the catcher  in your little league team  will literally kill me.  He hasn't gotten  a bass hit all year.  I should kill him. 
[03:18:30]  Fucking idiot.  Are we ready for leaks?  Oh, yes.  Piss time.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.  I am going to  machine gun  this entire  motherfucking building  before I blow it up.  Die!  You're dead.  Who's next?  Steve, probably.  He's dead.  Ooh, Danny.  Uh, E-Rod.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:19:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show  with Colin Quinn  who's going to be  at Gotham Comedy Club  starting tonight.  We're up to Thursday, right?  That's right, tonight.  Yeah.  Wow, where's the week going?  I thought it was like Tuesday or Wednesday.  Behind us. 
[03:19:30]  But it was Tuesday or Wednesday the other day.  It just was.  We were days ago.  At least I didn't fall asleep like some of your guests.  I heard Patrice and Vosn.  This week, now Jimmy was out for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  I was in La La Land.  Right, that's what they call it, the old left coast.  What, Louisiana?  Wow.  And then we had our stand-ins or sit-ins, whatever you want to call them.  Our hack-ins.  Fat Bob Kelly.  He took up a couple of seats. 
[03:20:00]  And then Patrice came in and fell asleep.  And then Rich came in yesterday and fell asleep.  I got to tell you, though, something.  You're trying to justify the fact that you fell asleep.  I fell asleep once.  I know what you're doing.  Right here in this chair.  I know what he's trying.  Here's what I did.  Here's what I did.  Let me show you my biggest mistake.  Okay.  I did this.  I put my feet up, put the mic here, and went like this, and I was fucking exhausted.  And then people are talking, the show's going on, and then I opened my eyes, everyone was 
[03:20:30]  gone, and this gentle music was playing.  This gentle, like, music box music.  They all left me, and all the listeners heard was, and the music.  Yeah, we are stuck out here.  I was fucking like, and then I woke up like, huh, what?  And I didn't know where I was.  And then when it hit me that I had fallen asleep during the show, was I just like, oh  my god, I fucking fell asleep during the show. 
[03:21:00]  That is a joke.  And we had him on Pal Talks, everybody on the internet.  Yeah, everyone on the internet got this thing.  It's been screen capped.  It's all over the pool.  That is the funniest shit ever.  It was horrific.  There is something about this studio, I will say.  The chairs, the blue lighting, the darkness.  That is really funny.  The chairs.  Lean back in that call.  You'll feel.  It's like, ah, right?  Oh, yeah.  You could go right out in that.  Oh, incredible.  There's the music.  Here it is.  Was it, this was the actual music that day? 
[03:21:30]  And here's what they heard.  Not a snore, but just a kind of heavy breathing.  That's so funny.  Yeah.  How long was he doing that?  Oh, Christ.  20 minutes?  It was over 20.  It was 20 fucking minutes.  He only admitted 20, but it was a bit longer than 20.  It was Jimmy.  Yeah.  Jimmy's about to go down.  Hey, really fast.  I got to get props to the past.  If you go to Google, MySpace Voodoo is the number one search right now. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  See the power of the radio show?  We made MySpace Voodoo the number one search on Google.  This show's got power.  It's volcanic.  The activity, they're calling it volcanic.  So there you go.  MySpace Voodoo.  That's crazy, huh?  So how many people go to that?  250.  Yeah, that's all it takes.  Google's not a big website yet, so.  Nah.  It's 250 clicks and it's number one, Colin.  I wish I could have taught us some idea like that. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, no.  I'm starting something else called Giggle.  It's like if you want to laugh on the net, you type in a concept and it finds funny things.  And you throw a joke in when he jokes at Manchester.  Good.  It'll go good with my American gangster.  Maury's got missing kids.  But they're not missing.  I told you, Maury.  He is not the father.  The mother told her how to get away from a kidnapper.  Oh, whatever.  Hey, we got another two girls, one cup reaction.  I don't know if this is good, but Danny's brought it in.  It's a grandma watching that horrific video.  She's the grandma that one of the girls eating. 
[03:23:00]  What?  Oh, shit.  You haven't seen two girls, one cup yet?  Oh, no.  Okay.  All right.  Roll them.  You won't even faze him.  Really?  It's like a faze.  Do you guys want to eat one cup of soda?  This is like an internet sensation.  It's a phenomenon in the non.  Stop fighting.  I only watch the saucy ones like, you know, that big in front of Britney stuff.  That's good.  All right.  Here you go.  Oh, is that funny?  And we like to tape it for the internet.  So this is...  I'm still trying to get Kim Kardashian, ladies and gentlemen.  This is two girls, one cup. 
[03:23:30]  That's the camera for Colin.  What is this nonsense?  Well, what do you see so far?  I see an Indian girl and a white girl, and they're pulling each other once, pulling  the top down.  That's it.  Exposing her boobs.  Just exposing the boobs.  There you go.  Nice, right, Colin?  Yeah.  Very nice, actually.  All right.  Hey, what?  Oh, God.  Why did it come out the texture?  Turn, turn.  Why?  Why does it come out the texture of ice cream, though?  That's the only amazing part.  See, that's why I think it's fake. 
[03:24:00]  Why aren't you watching?  Turn around.  Why don't you just fucking be a man?  Yeah, Colin, you got to hold it.  It's making me sad.  You got to hold it.  Colin.  Colin.  He's got to be sad.  Come on, you fucking fucking girls.  You made us pause the tape.  Now look at it.  Look at it.  He's got to be sad.  We're only halfway done.  Look at it.  I didn't think it would phase you.  Oh, Colin.  Look at that monitor so we can get your pretty face on camera.  Right there.  There's a pail just in case you get sick. 
[03:24:30]  Now, just watch the rest of it.  You have to watch.  You got past the worst part.  It should remind you of yourself in the business.  All right.  All right.  Roll him.  All right.  Oh, God.  Now watch it.  Colin, watch.  What are you doing?  What's going on?  Colin, stop looking away.  I'm going to throw up.  You're ruining our radio show.  We had to put pause again.  Colin.  Throw up.  Oh, it's great.  All right.  Here.  Let's bring it to throw up.  There you go.  Look, she's puking the shit up. 
[03:25:00]  Now watch.  This is.  Now she's puking shit into the other girl's mouth.  She's puking shit into the other girl's mouth.  Watch, watch.  Look at that one.  That was a gem.  She puked.  Oh, look.  They're so hungry.  The girls are so hungry, Carl.  Carl's got.  He can't get away from it.  The fucking.  The one girl ate the shit and then puked it into the girl's mouth.  Oh, that's a great reaction.  People have thrown up from watching this.  I thought you said he wasn't going to be funny.  Yeah, really, really puked. 
[03:25:30]  That was a disgusting pair.  Well, with that, we got a grandma that just watched.  Well, she watched the same video Colin just watched.  Here it is.  What the hell?  Get out of here, Jackie.  Where is it?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Grandma.  Oh.  Oh, no. 
[03:26:00]  No.  No, I can't.  Oh, she's thrown up.  Oh.  She's got up.  Jackie.  What's wrong with you?  Good grief.  You need to talk to someone.  Oh, that's a mess.  Oh, one sec. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, one sec.  What's the deal on that, Danny?  Well, the clip ends with her running into the bathroom gagging.  Check out the video.  It's actually up on collegehumor.com.  All right.  What is that video that we just saw?  Yeah, that's everywhere.  That's everywhere.  And then the reactions to it are getting put up all over everywhere, too.  I mean, I've heard there's a lot of those videos right now. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, is that right there?  But I can't watch it.  Let's see old granny.  No, with this one, it's...  I don't know.  This one is taking off.  I don't understand why some of this stuff takes off.  Reactions to this.  Robert Plant's watching the video.  Why am I bothering to write my manifesto and put it out when this is the kind of shit that  takes off?  Look how petrified her face is.  Holy shit, she can't figure it out.  Oh, wow.  She can't figure it out.  That's a great reaction.  Oh, my God.  Oh, she looks like Dr. Zayas.  Two girls, one cup.  She looks like Imus. 
[03:27:30]  She does.  Yeah, a little Imus in there.  This is what Imus has been up to.  It's a nappy-headed cup.  Wow.  Two girls, one cup.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got a jerk.  No, I can't.  I can't.  How could you keep watching?  I was going to...  Jonah!  Who showed their grandmother this?  Who doesn't?  Hey, let's go to O-Town.  Alex.  Here's what you get for giving me a nickel for fucking my birthday.  Watch this shit-eating video in Brazil. 
[03:28:00]  Fucking caustic old congee.  You've been wrecking our lives for years.  You're a burden.  Grab your chest and fall down the stairs already.  So I can fucking cash in on that stamp collection.  And fucking sell your Hummels.  So I can fucking sell those little fucking figurines.  Make a few dollars.  Buy myself a good tranny.  Alex?  Hey, what's up, O-N-A?  How you guys doing?  Alex!  You're going to be late for school, son.  Alex? 
[03:28:30]  You guys need to go to twogirlsonecup.com  and actually click on the one that says  worst reaction ever.  Dude, it's absolutely fucking hilarious.  You can hear the chick, like, just...  You can hear her heaving and shit in the background  and she actually throws up.  It's absolutely fucking hilarious, dude.  And it's just the chick watching it?  Yeah, she's watching it, but she sets up the camera  like the rest of the reaction videos, whatever.  But, dude, you can hear her heaving  and it's just so fucking funny, dude.  She puts her hand up in the middle of it  and you can tell it's real. 
[03:29:00]  You can tell it's very real.  It's fucking great, dude.  All right, cool.  What is that behind you?  What are they doing on this one?  This is twogirlsonefinger.  Put the fucking on all screens, all right,  before I smack you in the face.  Twogirlsonefinger?  All right, thanks, sir.  What is that, diarrhea?  No, it's puke.  They're just using...  It's called twogirlsonefinger.  Oh, that's disgusting.  What, um...  They're throwing up all over the place.  Oh, they're kind of throwing up on the camera lens?  You know what's that?  Oh, what's that?  Oh, what's that for you? 
[03:29:30]  Oh.  The one girl is shitting into the mouth of the other girl.  But that's at least a big, solid one.  But it's all broken together.  So what?
