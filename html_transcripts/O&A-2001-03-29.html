<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic mix of planned segments and spontaneous outbursts, characterized by pervasive profanity and sexually explicit humor. The show opened with discussions about the Gear Magazine "Best Ass Contest," offering a Las Vegas trip as a prize, and the reality show *Boot Camp*, featuring extended audio clips of drill instructors' abusive language. Opie's struggles with a Bosch wiper blade commercial, attempted in both English and butchered Spanish, provided a recurring comedic element.  Numerous listener calls followed, many detailing their experiences with military training or reacting to *Boot Camp*.  The in-studio crew included Rick and "Stinky."

The hosts then launched into a tirade about the cancellation of promised nude bartenders for their pre-vacation party, threatening a SoBe boycott and public shaming of the salesperson, Robert.  A call to Robert (or someone claiming to be him) resulted in a promise to rectify the situation.  This segued into a discussion about a new Pinnacle herbal product, “Monkeying Around,” prompting suggestive comments and mispronunciations.  Bob Guccione Jr. (Gear Magazine) then joined the show, engaging in a wide-ranging conversation touching on Gear Magazine's content, the "Best Ass Contest," P. Diddy's name change, Penthouse's simulated ejaculate recipe,  his views on HIV/AIDS, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and a past feud with Axl Rose.  Several guests were present in the studio including Pete Best (former Beatles drummer), two women described as "retarded Laverne and Shirley," and Kimmy (mistakenly identified as a *Survivor* contestant).  A caller, Patty, confronted Guccione Jr. about his HIV/AIDS comments. The nude bartenders, however, failed to materialize.

The broadcast continued with a Diamond Vision commercial, followed by banter about their vacation and a past Martin Luther King Day broadcast.  A lengthy interview with Pete Best ensued, punctuated by the hosts' crude interruptions and sexually suggestive remarks.  This was followed by a phone call with Andrew Dice Clay, and a discussion about the 1960s *Batman* TV show, focusing on Burt Ward (Robin), and degenerating into vulgar discussions about the actors' supposed sexual exploits.

Bert Ward himself then joined the show, discussing his approach to different age groups, his daughters, his experiences concealing the size of his genitals on the *Batman* set, and his friendships with Adam West and Bruce Lee.  A call from a fan, Marion, turned awkward due to her speech impediment, prompting insensitive comments from the hosts.  Kimmy from *Survivor* returned, engaging in a sexually suggestive exchange with the hosts and Dice Clay.  A call from Psycho Mark followed, featuring highly profane and rambling conversation with offensive language targeting female callers and hosts.  Madison, a stripper, made a partial on-air disrobing.  

The show then focused on a promotional read for Diamond Vision eye surgery and a raunchy game called "What's in My Pants," played with Kimmy and Lady Di (remotely).  The game involved graphic descriptions of pubic hair styles using crude language and animal comparisons.  Several other guests, including Madison (naked and serving beers), Jamaican Mike, and Psycho Mark, were present.  Announcements and plugs for various clubs (CPI, Blue, and Wall Street) and Kimmy’s appearances were interspersed.  The Best Ass Contest winner, Allison, was mentioned.  The show concluded with more raunchy commentary and sexual innuendo, including discussions about body weight and physical appearance.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently interrupted each other, engaging in lewd comments and sexually explicit discussions.

So if you want to vote really fast, go to WNAW.com or FoundryMusic.com. 
[00:04:00]  One of those lucky ladies will be going to Las Vegas, courtesy of Gear Magazine.  And thank you, Pinnacle Hornigotweed, for sponsoring another one of our fine contests.  Yeah.  And, of course, the one thing we've been waiting for, Sobe Nude Bartenders.  Yes.  Sobe Nude Bartenders.  Now, nude?  Nude.  Really nude?  That was the requirement.  Nude bartenders.  You're going to be completely nude.  They're girls.  Yes. 
[00:04:30]  And I'm just saying, I don't want to be tricked.  Hey, it's the nude bartenders.  Hey, look, it's guys.  We're real funny.  Get the F out.  And someone figured out whose brother I am.  And you know what?  I really don't want to.  Just trying to do my own thing, man.  What?  They finally figured it out.  I'm surprised they didn't come up with it over a year ago.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think that's his real name? 
[00:05:00]  John from West Islip.  You figured it out.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Anyway, 212-757-1027 is our phone number, Anthony.  Are you all right?  Yeah.  We're going on vacation.  As you know, today's our last day before vacation.  Just taking a quick week off.  Yeah.  A week plus a Friday.  So, you know, there's some live reads and stuff that we do during the show that we have  to pre-tape Opie.  Mm-hmm.  So when we run them, they sound like we're actually here.  It was my turn to be the A-hole. 
[00:05:30]  I said, I'm not doing them.  Yeah.  I picked up the ball.  I said, all right, look, I'll go in.  I'll blow them out.  And then he gives me, you know what I was just doing tags for?  Bosch Micro Edge Excel Wiper Blaze.  Uh-oh.  And you know how that rolls off my tongue.  They're back advertising with the show?  Yeah.  Well, the Strauss Discount Auto.  Do we have the bloopers?  Ah, there's a few of them.  We haven't played those in a long time.  Yeah.  And Steve says he's got another nine minutes of gold.  Really? 
[00:06:00]  And the Wiz ads that'll start running soon.  I was trying to get through those.  What is it called again, Anthony?  Oh, this is the Spanish one.  No, I want the one where he just curses like when he loses his ass.  What do you got, Steve?  Have you been keeping some of the stuff from...  Well, the past nine minutes I'm sure will be stellar, but, you know, something I can't  even bring those in maybe for another week or so.  He cursed so much.  I'm going to have to go through that so, so carefully to get out all of the Fs and the 
[00:06:30]  Ss.  Well, the Bosch people haven't been with us for a while now.  No.  It's been a really long time.  It's been about a year.  From the ONA archives, check this out.  This is actual audio.  All I had to do was a, what, a seven-second tag, Steve?  This goes back about a year ago.  Well, this last batch was about four, four ten-second tags, and then in addition to the  three sixty-second live reads he had to cut.  Oh, yeah.  This is classic, Anthony. 
[00:07:00]  I mean, this is what I found out.  All I had to do was a ten-second tag.  Listen to this.  You've got to be done super fast.  What do I got to say?  Which ones?  All of them?  This one, that one, that one, and that one.  Yeah.  Bosch Micro Edge Excel wiper blades.  Oh.  F***.  See your way clear.  See your way clear with Bosch.

The salespeople decided that we have such a huge Spanish-speaking audience  for our radio show  that we need to do that same commercial in Spanish.  This is no lie, people.  Yeah.  They thought it would be funny,  and I don't speak Spanish.  This is our crack sales team.

There you have it to start the show.  But we're here.  Last day before vacation, so, uh...  Yeah, we're gonna have fun today.  We're gonna have a lot of fun.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  You know, we gotta talk about boot camp.  That was fun watching that last night.  I'll tell ya.  We got some clips from boot camp.  It's our...  You know what?  I gotta say, it's my new favorite show.  Drill sergeants yelling at people's faces inches away.  Always funny.  I was laughing so hard last night.  Guy trying not to laugh.  We'll get into that discussion in a second.  But we should also talk about our lunch we had today with everybody.  We had a lot of fun.  Went over and, uh...  Got some Italian food.  Uh, at Routh's?  Yeah.  We haven't been to Routh's in a while. 
[00:14:30]  And, uh...  Yeah, you guys were, uh...  Bringing up yesterday's show.  And the end of yesterday's show.  Seems a lot of people enjoyed the little rant.  Yeah, let's get Rick and Stinky in here.  I'm gonna see how...  If they felt as uncomfortable as I did at lunch.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He started talking about his, uh...  Ex-money law again.  Well, Opie, you were the one that brought it up.  You know, I was fine leaving it buried, uh...  After yesterday's show.  I know we can't get into what you told us, which I had never heard.  You're a sick elf. 
[00:15:00]  I'll tell that story someday.  Don't worry about it.  All the stories come out on the air eventually.  Yesterday's show.  It's all about timing, Ben.  It's hilarious.  It sounded like an Irish family in Boston, you know.  Yesterday's show, talking a little bit about the, uh...  Ex-mother-in-law.  Judy!  And, uh, Opie brought something up that I had forgot.  Stinky.  I think I blocked things out.  Did you have a fun, uh, lunch there, Stinky?  Yeah, it was nice.  Thanks, guys.  Wasn't it kind of, uh, uncomfortable when Ann started, uh, talking again?  Well, it's like the new Ann. 
[00:15:30]  He's starting to...  Oh, yeah, the new Ann.  To blow off steam.  It's therapy.  It is therapy.  Well, I was fine with leaving it alone.  But you're doing, like, soliloquies.  I mean, when you get into this...  When he gets into this, though, it's like...  It's not a conversation.  You just sit back and listen until he's done.  Okay, here he goes again.  He's off and running.  But I had completely blocked out the, um...  The time we were flying from Boston to Los Angeles. 
[00:16:00]  Los Angeles, right.  At this time, um...  Uh, the, uh...  The significant others were still in New York.  We were living at my mother-in-law's house.  Correct.  And, uh, Opie has to remind me that...  For a ten-minute drive, we needed a lift to what is called the Logan Shuttle.  It's a bus.  We wanted a ride to Logan Airport, which was, uh, 45 minutes away.  I can't drive to Logan.  I don't like driving all the way to the airport.  Don't like it. 
[00:16:30]  I want to stay home.  Or begging, because we don't know the area yet.  Right.  We don't know nothing of the area.  So she says she'll drop us off at, uh, the Logan Shuttle.  The Logan Express is a bus.  It'll take you to the airport.  It's, uh...  It's a few minutes away.  So we all get in the car, and she drives, which later on, after we had lived there a while,  we realized where she was taking us was probably a ten-minute drive.  You get on a road, you get on another road, and you're there. 
[00:17:00]  It took us about 45 minutes to get to this place, because I forgot, I blocked this out.  Whenever the mother-in-law would take us anywhere.  I can't make left turns.  I can't make a left turn, but three rights makes a left.  And I always take the side streets.  I always take the back roads, because I don't like the highways.  It's highways, it's Route 9, if you're ever familiar with Boston.  It's not...  Well, it's like Jericho Turnpike on the island. 
[00:17:30]  It's not, I can't take lefts.  She's afraid.  I'm afraid to make left turn turns.  Afraid.  So we sat there on this Mr. Toad's wild ride through the backwoods of suburban Massachusetts,  when we realized later on, this is a ten-minute drive.  And she's driving us, you know, to the Logan Shuttle, because I can't drive to the airport.  But we almost missed our flight.  Remember that?  Mm-hmm.  Thank you for reminding me during lunch today. 
[00:18:00]  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  I can't, I choose not to make left turn turns.  But even better, remember when you had to go to Annie Mark's?  Annie Mark's.  That was the best story that you told at lunch today.  To this day, I couldn't tell you how to get there, because it was this maze thing.  She should drive for the mob when you're trying to take a prisoner to the camp.  You wouldn't even have to blindfold them.  I couldn't remember where we were.  We'd be driving down these back roads, and, you know, I'd be driving in my car. 
[00:18:30]  She's in the back seat, going, all right, make a left here.  Now turn, make a right.  I don't know how to make the left, so we're just going to take the way I take,  which is a bunch of right-handsons.  Make a right.  Make a right.  And I'm driving in circles during this way.  And later, after living there a while, I realized, again, had to be a five-minute drive.  Five-minute drive.  It took a half hour.  But the funny part about that story, she wasn't driving.  You were driving. 
[00:19:00]  She was giving directions with all right turns.  I don't even like being in the car during left-hand turns.  And she finally told you that the reason, yeah, she went that way,  was because she doesn't like left-hand turns.  And she didn't know how to get there.  Dude, she did not know how to get there, telling me how to get there by making left turns,  because she never had done it.  So I'm like, why are we making a right?  I know it's got to be this way, because the town that we were going to is that way.  Well, Anthony, because...  Make a right.  Okay, go up, make a right.  Now make this right. 
[00:19:30]  Three rights.  It's a left.  Three rights, make a left.  Three rights, make a left.  Where's my scotch?  Get the box of wine.  Unbelievable.  Thank you for refreshing my memory.  I'm sure you'll come up with a bunch more, Opie.  Opie remembers.  He takes pleasure in saying,  Dan, remember the time Judy did this?  I'm like, ah!  I blocked it off.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I got a guy that works with us that does not make left turns,  and he's a service tech. 
[00:20:00]  He drives all day long on the island,  and when he goes into Manhattan, he's a total nightmare.  He just keeps going right and right and right and right to get back.  So he doesn't make lefts either?  No, not at all.  He's, like, petrified of it.  It's crazy.  Huh.  And when anybody else drives with him,  it makes us nuts driving with him.  You'd have to be a goddamn lunatic to make a left on tune.  I stick to rights,  because then I only got to look one way.  It's a right tune.  Your brother wants in on this. 
[00:20:30]  Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Jack Cook.  And what about the time that we played up at,  I forget the name of the place.  Oh, God.  We were playing,  and you had to take the band that we moved the equipment in to take her home.  Dude, that was an I want to go home story.  Oh, get this.  Rotgut's playing.  We live down in New York.  We got a gig up in Boston.  Kind of exciting and fun for a band.  So Judy wants to go.  I want to go and see Rotgut. 
[00:21:00]  So, all right, we pile in.  She drives with one of her friends.  Not with us.  She gets there.  Her friend leaves her there.  Because Judy goes,  I want to stay and watch the band.  So the friend leaves.  End of the night comes.  We just get done with the set.  I want to hang out.  I want to go home.  Like, you want to hang with the band?  We're having a good time.  We're up in Boston.  This is kick-ass.  I want to go home.  I go to my brother, Joe.  I've got to take the band. 
[00:21:30]  The equipment's going to be loaded in shortly.  Just move the equipment off the stage.  And I will be right back.  I am just taking Judy home.  I know nothing of the area.  Judy's going to give me directions on how to get from Boston, the club,  to about 20 miles in the suburbs to her house.  I was lost.  So lost.  She's drunk off her ass on the front seat.  And I'm looking at my watch going, the band thinks I'm dead.  Because I've got to be dead.  Oh, yeah.  We definitely thought you got into some kind of horrible, disfiguring action. 
[00:22:00]  The equipment now is being either locked in the club for the night or moved out into the snow.  Where the band's got nowhere to load the equipment.  As I'm driving Judy around, now the truck's running out of gas.  Judy, where's the gas station?  I don't know.  I've got to go home.  I know where this one is.  I slung.  And she's flopping all over the seat.  Dude, I was getting so pissed.  I started jamming on the brakes just to watch her flop into the footwell.  And then, like, pull her back up on the seat. 
[00:22:30]  Do you have any idea where we are?  No, this doesn't look familiar.  Finally, finally, get her home.  I swear, I just about slowed the van down and pushed her out in front of the house.  Got back maybe two or two and a half hours after I left.  It was supposed to be maybe a 45 to 50 minute trip.  Like an hour tops round trip.  Two and a half hours later, I come back to a band that wanted to effing kill me. 
[00:23:00]  It was closer to three and a half hours.  Yeah.  They wanted to kill me.  I thought for sure you had an accident.  Yeah, and there's Judy, 90 pounds, soaking wet, flopping around the cab of this truck, hammered.  I don't know.  What road are we on?  Now, here's your mistake.  You made a left turn.  You made the mistake because you made a left turn.  Yeah, we moved the stuff out into the street that night. 
[00:23:30]  Anthony, what are we going to do about this?  Stay in the seat.  Where are we?  I have no clue where we are, Judy.  You have to look around.  Tell me which way to go.  We are on Route 9 somewhere in Natick.  Natick?  I know a great place for fried clams and steamers right up the road.  Judy, it's three in the morning.  Oh, I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Can we stop and get a box of wine? 
[00:24:00]  I swear to God.  So when I finally got back, yeah, the guys were fuming piss.  But that right there is an example of I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Thanks for the reminder, Joe.  All right, man.  I'll see you this weekend.  Take it easy.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Steve, what's going on?  It's N.E.W.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Opie, wasn't there a situation at the mother-in-law's house about a painting or a poster?  A painting or a poster?  Painting or a poster? 
[00:24:30]  I remember this.  Yeah, I thought you told a story about a year and a half ago.  Painting or a poster?  Yep.  Where she took my picture down because...  Yeah, that was it.  That was it.  Oh, that was the picture of the Demented World cover.  Right.  That's right.  That she had up on the wall.  And then when proudly displayed, the marriage went on the fritz.  She was like,  I just feel bad that I also have to get rid of Opie.  A picture of Opie.  Oh, they're together.  So, yeah, she felt kind of bad about that. 
[00:25:00]  Did she like Opie better than you?  Well, she probably does now.  I'll tell you that one.  She could have just cut you out of the Demented World picture and kept it hanging.  There you go.  Take care, guys.  All right, Steve.  I like a home.  Thanks for the memories.  Cool.  I like a home.  All right, why don't we take a break?  All right.  We want to talk about boot camp for just a little bit because this show was really cool last night.  Pretty cool.  I don't know how much it'll have as far as legs go.  You know what I mean?  How long it'll last before any novelty wears off.  Because how many times can you tune in and watch the guys yell?  It's still very fun to watch. 
[00:25:30]  But they're going to have to come up with some new stuff.  Yeah, if you saw the show, you know, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  And I also watched The Job with Dennis Leary and Adam Ferrara and Lenny Clark.  And that was hilarious last night, too.  Yes.  I'm so glad I have a VCR that works.  So, pull up a chair.  Get a box of wine and listen to Opie and Anthony.  I want to go.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  More to be wild. 
[00:26:00]  Boo-boo-boo.  More stupidity on the way.  Yeah.  Rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr.  1027.  WNEW.  Saturday night starting at 7.  WNEW gives you wheeze.  Hey, what's up, wheezer?  And cheese.  Cheese, my, terrible.  7 to 10 is Brother Wee, endorsed by Opie and Anthony.  At 10, Eddie Trump cranks out the best variety of metal.  Nice, that's right. 
[00:26:30]  And cheesy hair bands on Saturday night rocks.  It's Wheeze.  Nice.  And cheese.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony Planet Java.  Yes.  Finally, iced coffee just got cool.  We're drinking this stuff in the back office like crazy.  The packaging is cool.  It's everywhere that Coca-Cola products are sold, right?  Yes.  We're digging the three flavors.  Java Delic, a grown-up milkshake, the perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee. 
[00:27:00]  Also, Caramoca, it's chocolate caramel in a coffee.  And our favorite, Tremble.  Yeah.  And you'll be trembling.  Yeah, Tremble is the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  So students, truckers, and moms, this is a good thing to check out if you're looking for a little boost.  Imagine giving Muhammad Ali some Tremble.  Wow.  He'd shake himself through the earth.  I feel like a jackhammer.  They're going to have sampling trucks hitting the streets of Manhattan and all over, I guess, the tri-state area starting Monday, April 9th. 
[00:27:30]  So look out for the Planet Java trucks and give it a taste for yourself.  Yeah.  All right?  Be yourself with Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude and available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  Iced coffee just got cool and it's called Planet Java.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary.  And you know what?  You will never hear me on the Opie and Anthony show on 102.7 WNEW.  That's a guarantee.  If you hear somebody claiming to be me, it's probably Willem Dafoe.  Not me.  I wouldn't do the show.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:28:00]  Hmm.  Now look what we do.  Now look what we do here.  Let's talk about boot camp.  Ah, which is on the same time as the job.  I watched the job, but I taped the second half of boot camp.  What do I do?  I watched boot camp.  Ah, now you see, to get taped, the job.  To get the ratings.  So, the Nielsen's.  For people that have the Nielsen boxes, you've got to watch the job and tape boot camp.  All right, watch the job, tape boot camp. 
[00:28:30]  That way they get the, uh, pathetic.  Another mother-in-law story on the way, by the way.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I forgot about the party story.  That is a really good one.  Vinny, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right, Vinny.  Yeah, that, uh, boot camp show last night was good.  It was good, right?  Yeah, I liked that, uh, one drill sergeant that was screaming like a maniac.  There are two drill sergeants that are just awesome, and then the other two are like,  yeah, whatever.  Yeah, that, uh, there was like that black woman.  She's all right.  But, I mean, there's two guys that are just hilarious. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, and that, uh, the chick thing doesn't really watch.  I mean, it's not as, they just can't get the voice booming like the guys do.  And they're not as scary.  Yeah, you get some big drill instructor with the hat tipped down and poking your face and  two inches away yelling at you.  It's scary.  Guy has no neck.  You like the show, though?  Yeah, I like, the best part was, uh, when they get to the place and they dump out all  their luggage, and that one guy with the braces. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, that guy, he makes the freaking poodle.  I'm so embarrassed, because the guy's from Jersey.  It looks like he's a Yankees fan, because he had his Yankees hat on.  He's like 25, and he's got braces.  It's like, oh.  I know.  Thanks for representing.  Huh?  The guy just, like, grabs the balloon and just bites it.  Yeah, we'll explain the whole thing, but thanks, Vinny.  Okay, have a good vacation.  Oh, I appreciate that.  Thank you.  Do you want to explain Boot Camp really fast, Anthony?  Another Survivor-type show, obviously.  Guys and girls, um, how many total? 
[00:30:00]  Uh, I don't even know, like...  It's like five and five, something like that.  Uh, yeah, whatever.  I don't know.  A bunch.  I think there's about 12.  Guys and girls.  And, uh, they have to go through a Boot Camp-type training, and, um, they vote out one person.  One of their own.  Every week.  And the person that gets voted out...  Okay, go ahead, sir.  ...gets to take someone with them.  Right.  They turn around and say, oh, yeah?  Well, I'm taking Meyer with me or whatever. 
[00:30:30]  And they do this on Dismissal Hill.  Dismissal Hill.  Some choices to be made.  Some choices.  Some decisions to be made at Bonfire.  Now it's Dismissal Hill.  Dismissal Hill Bonfire.  I hope this isn't a disaster like Temptation Island.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, Fox, they, you know, they got us all interested in Temptation Island,  and the payoff wasn't that good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, uh, they didn't have, they, they voted one guy out last night, but he wasn't able  to take someone along with him, because they had already lost a recruit.  And that...  Very early. 
[00:31:00]  You know what?  I got in trouble last night.  Why?  What'd you do?  Because of that whole scene with the black girl?  Yeah.  Subconsciously, I guess, I...  They warm it up.  Subconsciously, I didn't even realize I said it.  Yeah.  I went, and I feel bad I said it, but I said it, so I might as well throw it out there.  What'd you say?  Uh, it was obvious that, uh, the black girl was leaving boot camp after about six hours.  Yeah.  In TV time, I think it was like the first 15 minutes, but I think it was about six hours.  She couldn't take it, and she wanted to go home. 
[00:31:30]  I want to go home.  So I went, I went under my breath, uh, figures.  Oh!  Figures?  Figures what?  It was a stupid comment, obviously.  Oh, my God.  But Earl has a theory on that.  Earl says that they purposely found a lazy black girl to make the black people  look bad.  Ah, another whitey conspiracy.  Thank you for exposing that, Earl.  Well, now, what is your theory?  There's this black girl last night, boot camp.  She, uh, through the first day, she's crying, and then, uh, decides this isn't for her. 
[00:32:00]  In all fairness, I mean, the first six to eight hours were pretty damn intense.  The drill instructor's screaming at everyone.  Next thing you know, it looks like the black, uh, girl can't, uh, can't hack.  Then why did she sign up?  That's what, well...  She took a place that someone else could have, uh, had.  Yeah, think about the poor son of a bitch that just missed.  Because they had all these people that made it, and somebody just missed.  And then they got to watch and go, oh, I could have been in.  But your theory is that, uh, Whitey puts black people in these positions, uh, and, and 
[00:32:30]  picks, uh, lazy people so that white people can watch and go, ah, figures.  That's what you said in the back office.  I agree with Earl.  They said they find the most trifling black person they can get their hands on.  You know what I'm talking about, Earl.  What you want on this boot camp?  Your, uh, did so.  Oh.  Tony Soprano.  Come on, now.  A moulinion.  No.  And a charcoal briquette.  And a temptation in Ireland, black couple, was, was the mess couple. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So you, you might have...  And a lady had a kid.  You might be on to something.  Yeah, a kid out of wedlock.  So you might be on to something, Earl.  Stand clear of the shrapnel from the busting apart stereotype.  First real world.  First real world.  What's he, uh, Kevin, I think the guy was?  Kevin.  Oh, my God.  That guy was a little...  Captain issues.  He was, uh, wound up pretty tightly.  Wasn't he gay and stuff?  No.  He was the guy that, uh, like, everything that happened in that house that he didn't like  was racially motivated.  Oh, okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Earl.  Well, great theory.  We'll look into it and see, uh, how it, uh, how it plays out.  Did you enjoy boot camp?  I saw it in bits and pieces.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  The drill instructors, I mean...  Are priceless.  The priceless is right.  They were just hilarious.  Mm-hmm.  We got some audio from the, uh, drill instructors.  So, I mean, these contestants, you gotta call them contestants, because they're not really  going through a real, real boot camp.  No.  Even though I think they're there for, like, 30 days or something.  Is it?  But, uh, they get off the bus. 
[00:34:00]  Drill sergeant's screaming and yelling, get off my bus!  And they're just going through their stuff and just, just making their lives a living  hell, screaming every, every three seconds.  The suitcase is being dumped over a grate, because, uh, one guy had a suitcase open, and  I guess the drill sergeant told him to, um, told him to take his stuff out.  So, so he starts picking things out one at a time, he's like, dump it, dump it, dump  it!  He dumps all his stuff out.  Right.  Really, like, nasty, just yelling, spitting on these people. 
[00:34:30]  And one guy, I mean, you gotta be pretty stupid, if you sign up for a show called Boot  Cam, I'm sure they told you that it's gonna be kind of, kind of intense.  Yeah.  Why in the hell would you bring a picture of you and your wife?  Well, you know, he maybe thought he'd be able to put it up on, uh, his, a night table,  much like, uh, the people do in Big Brother House.  Big Brother House, yeah, they have their loved ones' pictures, and, uh, knowing that the,  uh, well, drill instructor was gonna have a, yeah, the drill, the drill instructor got  a hold of the picture of, uh, the, the, the happy couple, and this is what happened last 
[00:35:00]  night on Boot Camp.  Hurry up, you know, stop it, stop it!  Say goodbye to these, as a matter of fact, kiss your wife right now, kiss her.  Bye, hon, bye, hi, I'm his new pal!  He's showing, he's looking at the picture of his wife, yelling at the picture of his  wife.  That guy's, that guy's the best drill sergeant.  Yeah.  Drill sergeant.  Wasn't he the one, uh, hanging out, out, outside the, uh, the, the Hummer? 
[00:35:30]  The Humvee.  The Humvee?  These, these bunch of sad sons of bitches are in the back of some truck, finally a minute  away from these D.I.s that are just screaming at him all the time.  Yo, your head's kinda messed up, what you did on the back over there?  Let me find out you were pimping that ass.  Yo, chill, I'm on the radio.  What was that, just, uh, old dirty?  Old dirty waiting to come on the show.  Uh, Doughboy.  What's going on, boys?  I hung up.  Yo, when that, uh, when that pig farmer chick, the 35-year-old, whatever the hell, when she  was doing those pull-ups, she had the biggest jugs with the hugest nipples poking out. 
[00:36:00]  That wasn't hot, man.  It wasn't hot, but it was funny as hell.  What about, I didn't expect to see that.  What about the run they had to do?  They had to do a, a three-quarter mile run out and then back, so it, it adds up to a mile  and a half.  Yeah, and she broke her poor hoof.  And she was, oh, you could have walked faster than what she was doing.  She was doing, like, 15-minute miles, dude.  Yeah.  I can't make it!  And the guy's just yelling at him.  And then they all started crying for her.  Yeah.  I know, I know.  I know, they're getting all emotional because she finished the mile and a half run. 
[00:36:30]  Please.  Played her tool.  She's going to be, uh, so gone it's not even funny.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, that's that pig hoar, man.  I couldn't stand her.  Let me tell you, I wanted to smack her right in the teeth.  What, the pig farmer?  Yeah, I couldn't.  Pig farmer.  Man, when she was running that mile, man, I laughed so hard, I stabbed the baby and burnt  my house down.  Right.  All right, thank you, Sean.  You got it.  We got more audio of the drill instructors.  So, uh, they're asking, uh, all the contestants, you know, what they do and stuff. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  And one lady, uh, she said she was a housewife.  Yeah, but she said she was an, uh, army or a, uh, military housewife.  She said, she said, yeah, I'm a military housewife.  So, I guess her husband is in the military and, uh, the drill sergeant, again, had some  problems with her answer.  There's a difference.  What is the difference between a military spouse and a regular spouse?  Tell me, recruit.  I love you.  I love you.  Shut your skull.  Tell me.  Tell me, recruit.  She starts telling her. 
[00:37:30]  Shut your skull.  See, but it's not as intimidating with the woman.  She's just yelling with that, that voice doesn't do it.  Like the booming voice of, uh, one of the drill instructors.  Yeah.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, I just want to tell you guys just how realistic that boot camp is to Marine Corps  boot camp.  From, from the minute those DIs get on the bus.  I went through Marine Corps boot camp in 1979 and it, it brought the hair up on my spine  last night from the minute they got on the bus.  Yeah.  It was 10 times worse than the real thing. 
[00:38:00]  I'd imagine.  But it's just, but imagine going over to hangover to Marine Corps boot camp.  Compound that and have some morons screaming in your face.  Get out on the yellow prints.  You know?  Yeah.  How realistic.  It was awesome.  Cool.  You like the show?  Good show.  So far, so good.  So far, so good is right.  I thought it was going to be pretty wimpy to regular boot camp, but I tell you, the reality  to actual Marine Corps boot camp, uh, in, in terms of how they treat the people is mild, 
[00:38:30]  but it brought the hair up on my spine because that's how you were treated, but, you know,  it's glorified a little bit for TV.  All right.  Right on, Tim.  Thank you.  All right.  Keep up the good work, guys.  All right.  We will.  Let's go to, uh, Tommy.  Tommy, you're next on NAW.  Hey.  Hey, Tommy.  What's up?  Nothing, man.  I just did a boot camp, uh, for police academy in New Jersey.  I did it down Seagert, which is one of the toughest training academies in the state.  And you know your opening scene where the bus is pulling up and the four drill instructors  are just standing there waiting? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, they did that for us.  And let me tell you, I left it loaded in my pants in my car pulling up because that there's  no feeling like that in the world seeing those guys waiting for you.  You just know it's over from that point on, yeah.  It's done.  They came up to the car.  They start yelling, get out of your car.  They were pulling all the garbage in my car out.  They're going through my car.  You feel, you're just, you feel like you're being belittled from the day you get there to  the day you leave.  And that's, it's pretty real.  That's, that's how they do it.  Hell, it's a lot of fun to watch from the comfort of my couch. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  I feel a lot better now at the comfort of my couch, too.  All right, Tommy.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, did you see the pussy that was crying about his wife after eight hours?  I thought it happened to the parts for one day.  What a pussy that guy was.  That was, that was the best.  They all got, what, 60 seconds to call home?  30 seconds to call home.  Yeah, I think it was 60 and they were yelling 30 seconds to go.  Yeah.  And they should have made that guy do pull-ups till his arms fell off. 
[00:40:00]  And all of a sudden, the drill instructor's right in his face because he's getting a little  teary-eyed.  You're getting emotional already, man.  Hey, that lady drill instructor looks like a 12-year-old bully in a Marine costume.  She doesn't pull it off.  You know what?  She would kick your ass, though.  I mean, she's not as intimidating as the guys, but she would give you a run for your money,  man.  All right, ladies, come back.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Hey, we got a couple more audio clips, Anthony. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Then there's this fat guy.  He's like 29 years old.  Yeah.  Was it the fat guy that had the stuffed animal, the M&M stuffed animal?  He had a, it was a stuffed lemon.  Was it a lemon or was it?  It was a lemon.  Oh, okay.  I don't know what the hell that thing was.  They were screaming so loud, I couldn't really hear.  What is this for?  Yeah, they're yelling, what is this for?  What's the answer to that?  He had it hidden in his sneakers.  They're going through his stuff and they pull it out.  Okay, whatever.  A lemon.  A lemon with arms and legs.  Arms and legs.  And what did he say it was for? 
[00:41:00]  It goes just as a memento or something.  Brighten up.  Oh, to brighten up.  Right.  Brighten up my surroundings or something?  Well, we got the clip.  Here it is.  How embarrassing, though.  They find this and they go after you.  Shoe.  Stuffed in his shoe.  He's trying to hide it.  What is this for, recruit?  Put them all over his head.  I don't think he can hear you.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get closer.  What is Mr. Lemon doing?  What did he do?  Mr. Lemon is a stuffed lemon.  Okay.  And what is the function?  We got the green.  So what is it? 
[00:41:30]  Mr. Lemon is just around to make it for a nice atmosphere.  For a nice atmosphere.  That's pretty good.  We have a couple more clips.  We got the balloon guy coming up here.  Jason, what's up?  Dude, the best part is when you see the freaking drill instructor just yelling at someone and  they go and they interview the drill instructor and he's just like, yeah, that guy's a hammerhead.  And then they go back to him again and he's like, stop it, stop it, hammerhead.  And then, you know, yeah, he's a nice guy, but he's stupid, whatever.  You know what I'm talking about, right? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, but you didn't pick up on the best thing about it.  When the drill instructor was yelling, one drill instructor, when he's yelling, he's so  effing intimidating.  But then when they were interviewing him, he had this horrible lisp.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was kind of like Cindy Brady.  Yeah, they're all racking.  He's like, yeah, you know.  You know what I like?  The one that's yelling at one guy in front of the barracks and he's got his one arm like  curled up and he's pointing to the ground.  You know what I mean?  He looks like he's having a convulsion, like he's about to have a heart attack.  Yeah, he kept pointing at the ground. 
[00:42:30]  He's like, yo, yo.  So I'm like, I'll bury you.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll bury you.  This is going to be in the sand.  Right on, Jim.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Joe One Lake from Jersey.  He says, Paris Island, 1979.  Drill instructor calls me into his house, office.  Makes me read from the drill instructor manual.  I read, the drill instructor may not use his hands to hit recruit.  The drill instructor may not use his hands to hit recruit.  The drill instructor may not use his hands to hit recruit.  Then he asks me if I understand the rule and hit me with the book. 
[00:43:00]  What a mind F that would be.  Yeah, okay, I understand.  Poof.  Hit you with the book.  Chris, what's going on?  Choke yourself.  What's up, Paul?  How you guys doing today?  Good.  All right, cool, man.  Listen, I went on the island.  Thank you, bro.  And you guys are wrong with the female drill instructors.  They are ten times worse.  All right.  Yeah.  Tell us.  Yeah, ten times worse, man.  I was in the shower one time, and there was a recruit looking at one of the female recruits.  And they dogged the crap out of him, man. 
[00:43:30]  They really tore him apart.  Yeah.  All right.  I know they're not a joke.  I just think the guys are more intense.  Yeah.  Yeah, they are.  That Sweeney guy is really good.  Sweeney is great.  Thanks, Chris.  Let's go to Dennis.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Let me tell you something.  That was more like boot camp light compared to the one I went through.  Really?  See, everyone says that.  Yeah.  But the funny thing is, they get away with so much more freedom.  Like a phone call to home. 
[00:44:00]  Do that in here.  The only way you communicated with home was via a letter.  The only thing they couldn't deny you was a head call, water, or your mail.  And God forbid you had a name, like a last name.  We had a guy named Massingale.  Oh, no.  Guess what he was called?  Douche.  Yeah.  Recruit douchebag.  And then we had a recruit douchebag.  Exactly.  We had another guy named Gump.  Yeah.  No lie.  And then make matters worse, he was transferred in from the Air Force. 
[00:44:30]  Oh.  So he was the go-get, the go-for-recruit.  And every time they had to get something or something had to be brought to the platoon,  they would say, hey, recruit Gump, go get it.  And the whole unit had to yell in unison, run, Forrest, run.  I mean, it was just, but this, watching this again was just, it was like, it makes you,  if you've been through it, the first time you go through it, you're like, oh, I can't  wait to get down here, can't wait to get out of here.  But after you've completed, it just makes you feel like, wow, you've really accomplished  something. 
[00:45:00]  Cool.  But you never want to do it again.  All right.  Thank you, Dennis.  Thanks, guys.  We got two more clips.  We got the best clip coming up.  I just want to get, who do I want to get in here?  Ah, yeah.  Okay.  Chris?  Yeah, what's wrong, guys?  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, myself, I was also, I just got out of the Marines.  My little story.  For me, I used to actually stare at the mirror, point to the mirror, saying, you're  crazy.  I point to myself, I'm not crazy.  I had to do that for an hour and a half straight.  The entire rest of the two was still in line on formation squad day. 
[00:45:30]  You had to point at yourself in the mirror and say, you're crazy?  Then I point to the mirror saying, you're crazy.  I look at myself saying, I'm always crazy.  Had to go back and forth about an hour and a half.  What's that, dice?  You think?  You're crazy.  Not saying.  I'm not crazy.  I'm not not.  You're crazy.  Yeah.  But also, as a gentleman said a few minutes ago, it's saying that female control instructors  were a lot worse than a male.  Yeah, I guess they have more to prove.  Doesn't sound as bad, though.  Oh, they're freaking horrible.  They're like, they got chest high.  They're literally jumping up your face, screaming.  One of the kids in my platoon actually got bit by one of them accidentally. 
[00:46:00]  Okay, terrific.  Thank you, Chris.  All right, guys, take it easy.  All right, we got the audio clip of the balloon dog.  All right.  This is the guy from Jersey with the braces and the Yankee hat.  Yeah, he just looks like the guy that you're just going to go, oh, boy, this ain't good.  And I guess for a living, he makes balloon animals.  Yeah.  And the drill instructor basically asked if he could make a balloon animal for him.  Oh, sad.  This was hilarious, though. 
[00:46:30]  Recruiting a balloon sculptor, sir.  A balloon sculptor?  Yes, sir.  You have any?  Yes, sir.  Get out!  What kind of friggin' dog are you making, Yankee?  A poodle, sir!  That's a poodle?  What happened to its friggin' tail?  You know what I think of this poodle, Yankee?  Get out of my face! 
[00:47:00]  I said it!  I said it!  I said it!  It is just so much fun to watch them just scream at these people.  And they're all confused.  And they start yelling.  The people get all jumpy and confused and run one way and then the other.  Stop it, man!  Ray, what's up?  Hey, Opie, how you doing?  How you doing, Ant?  Thank you.  Listen, good story on the mail from boot camp.  I went through in 83.  The worst thing in the world you could have did was get pictures sent to you. 
[00:47:30]  Because they'd hand out your mail and you'd have to stand there and open it.  He'd sell pictures in it.  And whatever your wife looked like, good, dogs, fat, ugly, naked, they went on the board.  You didn't get to keep them.  They hung them up on a bulletin board for everybody else to gawk at.  And guys used to get naked pictures.  It was the worst thing in the world.  Oh, whoa.  So everyone else would get a peek at your naked girlfriend.  Oh, yeah.  And God forbid if you had a fat, ugly wife. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  Because he abused you to hell.  Well, thank you, Ray.  Take care.  All right.  A couple more calls and we'll move on.  John, what's up?  John.  Hello?  Hey, John, let's go.  How's it going?  I was in the Marine Corps.  And when we were on the bus just getting off, it was all white guys on the bus.  And then a black DI comes on.  And you can just hear everybody thinking, like, oh, great, black guy.  But the only one who said it is the guy sitting next to me.  He goes, oh, great, a nigger.  From that point on, he was private cracker, like, the whole time he was there. 
[00:48:30]  Jeez, racism.  Rearing his ugly head in the military.  Oh, no, the guy was a retard.  I couldn't believe that until he said it out loud.  Everybody turned.  Nobody.  Everyone's too scared to even turn around and say, and I'm sitting next to him.  Oh, my God.  That is.  And I'll tell you one thing.  You've got to be insane.  When you get on the plane to go down there, you won't have anything with you.  It just pulls on your back.  So they let these guys pack stuff with you.  Whoops.  Can't say the S word.  Oh, my bad.  All right, John.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  This guy wants to tell us he's an ex-Marine what happened off camera. 
[00:49:00]  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, O&A?  Good.  Oh, listen, I went to the Marine Corps boot camp as well, and I just want to let you know  that at boot camp, it's a great show and all.  They don't show what goes on behind the cameras there.  They say how the drill instructor's not supposed to lay their hands on you or whatnot and everything  is supposed to be copacetic, but it's not all true.  They really tear into you, and they get physical, and there are no cameras on there. 
[00:49:30]  So these guys who are really into going on this show, they're not really going through  what we all actually did go through.  Well, that's obvious, but, I mean, they push it pretty good.  Oh, yeah, they're pushing it pretty good.  I enjoy the show.  I think it's really great.  You know, you don't want the pig former lady dropping dead of a heart attack.  No.  It would be kind of funny.  So they can't push her like she's an 18-year-old recruit.  No.  But they do get pretty heavy and physical on you in there.  Yeah, I imagine they do.  I just like to yell.  Thanks, Chris.  Thank you. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, one more clip of yelling about haircuts.  Are you yelling?  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  Oh, I have no idea what they say.  That guy was an inch away from that guy's ear.  Yeah.  When he's yelling at two guys who were just ganging up on this one guy.  Right.  And yelling an inch away from the guy's ear.  And then as we complete this segment, we have audio of one of the recruits after he was yelled at like all night long last night. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Let's go to that.  I think it's Meyer.  I think it's Meyer.  You're out.  Don't you do it.  Don't you.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nothing else. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, that rock.  All right.  We got to take a break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Bob Guccione Jr. calling in in a few minutes here.  From Gear Magazine, eh?  Yeah.

Aww.  What?  You know, who effed us on this one?  Uh, that would be a salesperson by the name of Robert. 
[00:53:30]  What happened?  We were supposed to have nude bartenders.  Yeah, he confirmed it all yesterday, and, uh...  Day before vacation, we were going to have nude bartenders.  That was part of the party.  It was like a little, uh, little party for us.  What happened to the nude bartenders?  They're going to a strip-off.  What?  Exactly.  No, no, no, no.  There's something behind this.  They never intended on, uh, coming here.  Get them on the phone.  Yeah.  I tried.  I already paid them and everything. 
[00:54:00]  We were promised nude bartenders for our, uh, last show before vacation.  Now what?  Just going to have to send an intern for our beers?  Now what?  This is what.  Please do not drink Sobey beverages.  Until we get nude bartenders.  Swear.  Pass on the Sobey beverages.  There you go.  You watch how fast Robert calls us back now.  Oh, you watch now.  Do not drink Sobey beverages.  Until we get our nude bartenders. 
[00:54:30]  We're boycotting Sobey.  Now here is something we don't want to boycott.  introducing the exciting new herbal discovery for women from the fine people at Pinnacle.  It's Pinnacle monkeying around.  Yeah, these are the same folks that brought you Pinnacle Horny Goatwee that, that works really, really well.  But they discovered it works, uh, well, uh, for men more than women. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  So they went back into their laboratory, Anthony.  The laboratory at Pinnacle.  And, uh, they discovered a new formula to help the women with their sex drive.  And it's called Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  An exciting, all-natural sexual enhancer designed specifically for women to spark and support healthier, more satisfying relationships.  You know what that means.  Get their F on.  It's a rich blend, uh, herbal blend.  Contains the amazing botanical Monkey Tee Kwan Yin. 
[00:55:30]  Opie.  Monkey Tee Kwan Yin.  Wasn't she a skater in the Olympics?  Yeah, she's going for the gold in the Winter Olympics.  Yes.  It's a rare plant grown exclusively in the high altitudes of, get this, the Foukin Province.  In China.  F-O-O-K-I-N.  The Foukin Province in China.  Yeah, you're pronouncing it right.  Foukin.  Foukin.  Province in China, originally. 
[00:56:00]  Who doesn't, who doesn't like the, the Foukin?  Oh, everyone.  In China, it's a very popular place.  The Foukin Province in China.  Originally, it can only be accessed and picked by specially trained monkeys.  Damn monkeys.  Wait a minute.  Come on.  Dude.  The Monkey Tee Kwan Yin.  You know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't believe it either, guys.  I know you're in your car going, what, but we met with the Pinnacle people, the fine folks  at Pinnacle, and they swear all this is true. 
[00:56:30]  This is true.  That there's a Foukin Province, and they got specially trained monkeys to go down into, into  the deep valleys.  And get the Monkey Tee Kwan Yin plant.  There's a deep valley in the Foukin Province.  In the Foukin Province of China.  And these specially trained monkeys, that's how the Monkeying Around name came about.  Natural ingredients of Monkeying Around also include Zalu root from the Middle East,  horny goat weed from Asia, and Maku pure from the Amazon rainforest. 
[00:57:00]  So these specially trained monkeys, they pull the roots right out of the ground in the  Foukin Province?  In the Foukin Province.  In China.  Opie.  Special monkey.  We have a special monkey.  Go down, pick a rare plant in the Foukin Province in China.  That's right.  All in a safe, preservative, and allergen-free capsule. 
[00:57:30]  So if you're stressed out under pressure, or just need to add some spice to your sex life,  go down to GNC and get some Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Or you can call 1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Get some today.  Anthony?  Yes.  Sobe beverages?  Mm-hmm.  Worse than ups.  Oh my God.  Worse than ups.  And you know what UPS is worse than.  Get us our nude bartenders. 
[00:58:00]  Phew.  Has Robert called you back about the nude bartenders?  No.  Get a list of all his clients.  All the porno shops.  Get a list of every single one of his clients.  We bash one every...  We've been looking forward to the nude bartenders all week, and he tells you...  What time did he tell us that we're not getting the nude bartenders?  I got it on a message before.  How long ago?  I got it about a half hour ago.  It leaves it on a message.  Give me a list of all his clients. 
[00:58:30]  And the thing is, I had other girls that they were going to bring over from Stuff Magazine,  had some strippers they wanted to send over.  I said, no.  Let me help out Robert, because he's, you know, he works here.  All right.  Get a list of the clients.  For every...  How long of an interval do you want?  Every 20 minutes.  Every 20 minutes that he does not get in touch with us, we trash another client.  We trash yet another one of his clients.  First one already dead, thrown out onto the tarmac.  Sobe beverage.  Dead.  We are radio-sponsored terrorists right now. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, we're getting the list?  I know he's out.  Oh, you want us to start trashing that one?  Oh, my God.  There's a biggie.  There's a biggie.  Okay.  You don't want us bashing that one.  Especially now.  What other ones?  I need corn.  Oh.  All right.  Okay.  That's his livelihood, that one.  Better call us.  Call us and explain why we're not getting nude bartenders today. 
[00:59:30]  I need to hear this answer.  This one, too?  Yeah.  Which one?  What is that?  Stop running...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Stop running commercials for that, that, that, and of course that.  Okay?  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York. 
[01:00:00]  Robert.  Rick.  Yeah.  What happened?  What do you mean?  Is this Rick?  Yeah.  I left you a message very early this morning.  How about...  You just got it...  I got a call from the client late last night that the strippers couldn't make it.  Well, the guy's really pissed off.  That's what I'm hearing from Sobe.  They just called me.  They're extremely pissed.  What can I do?  They need nude bartenders immediately. 
[01:00:30]  Who is this?  This Rick?  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  What?  All right.  All right.  Let me find some naked chicks here.  Robert, we're serious.  All right.  Let me make a couple of calls.  You know me.  They want to trash every one of your clients today.  Oh, please don't do that.  That's what they're saying.  Please don't do that.  You better turn on your radio. 
[01:01:00]  They're on to your second client already.  All right.  Please, give me a chance.  Don't hurt me.  Nude bartenders.  All right.  I'll be right back.  If I have to get down there and pour myself nude, I will.  They said they're going to start the trashing at 5 o'clock today.  All right.  Sobe's already a lost cause.  They really ripped into them bad.  All right.  All right.  Let me call you back.  Big-breasted strippers.  All right. 
[01:01:30]  I'll call you right back.  If you get the new bartenders, everything will be okay with Sobe.  You got until 5 o'clock.  All right.  What time is it now?  4.15.  Well, actually, I'm right aside a new topless place now.  Let me see what I can do.  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Yep.  Now, do people have to drink?  Were you doing a Rick impression, Opie?  Or was that just... 
[01:02:00]  I was just trying to, like, change my voice a little bit.  Sure.  The rules, because that would have been a pretty big drink.  No, I wasn't doing a Rick.  I was just muffling my voice, so he couldn't even tell.  I think I pulled it off fine.  I think you did a good job.  Bob Guccione, Jr. on the hotline.  Bob.  Hi.  Mr. Bob, how are you?  Good.  How are you guys doing?  Oh, are you ruining some poor guy's life?  Yeah, pretty much.  Is this thing?  Yeah.  He's zapping with us and screwing up the show.  We were promised nude bartenders today, because it's our last day before vacation, and we found 
[01:02:30]  out a little while ago that we're not going to get our nude bartenders, so we're a little  pissed off.  Oh, I don't blame you, then.  So now we're trashing that poor sales guy's clients on the air.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Hey, why don't you have the deep voice like your father?  Well, because I didn't smoke 100 cigarettes a day for 30 years.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was a big smoker.  He stopped one day cold turkey.  Really?  Yeah.  Because he's got that voice, you know.  It's a Darth Vader voice, you know. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  You can come to the dark side.  It's the Darth Vader of nude chicks.  You've got nude chicks on the brain, guys, I'm noticing.  Well, you know why?  Because it's the day before vacation, you know?  Yeah, and we wanted to kind of have a party.  We were going to have these nude bartender girls, and it just screwed everything up.  Yeah, this is bad.  Yeah.  This is bad.  Maybe you might have legal action here.  Instead, we've got to talk to you.  Yeah, that's very much a come down.  There's many levels down. 
[01:03:30]  You know, if I knew you had nude bartenders on tap, I'd have been angling for a studio appearance.  Yeah.  Well, we're loving Gear Magazine.  Oh, great, man.  Do you own it, or what's your deal with this?  I just borrow it.  You just borrow it.  The guy who runs it is the out for a...  No, it's mine.  I own it, yeah.  And you're editor-in-chief as well.  Yeah.  And you gave us the trip to Las Vegas for our Best Ass Contest.  Right.  We thought it was safest to send you far away.  Yeah, we want to thank you for that.  Yeah, who's winning the Best Ass, then?  We can't say, because the voting has two hours to go. 
[01:04:00]  Ah.  We don't want anybody to hop on the favor.  Polls are still open.  Is somebody, like, very far ahead?  Um, it's between two girls.  Yeah?  Is a certain Jennifer Lopez in the running?  Uh-huh.  We don't dig the Jennifer Lopez butt.  Me neither.  Nah.  Me neither.  It's big.  It's big, and it's attached to Jennifer Lopez.  And Puffy's been there.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought Puffy was just dogging that.  Yeah.  Another detriment. 
[01:04:30]  P. Diddy, as he's going to be called next week.  He's changing his name, you know.  P. Daddy?  P. Diddy.  P. Diddy.  He's changing his name, because Puffy is now associated with this violence and gun shooting and stuff.  So he's changing his name, this is real, to P. Diddy.  It sounds like he will now be associated with the Teletubbies.  I know.  The fifth Teletubbies.  The fifth Teletubbies, P. Diddy.  I mean, come on.  It doesn't sound very intimidating.  No, exactly, no.  P. Diddy's in the house.  I know.  Honest. 
[01:05:00]  Well, that didn't work for Prince.  Why would he try that?  He's trying to do something.  Prince said, tell him.  Yeah, but, you know, the name change thing never works.  I hear O.J. is trying to do the same thing.  I want to be O-A-O-O-O-K-O-J.  I'll change it to A-O-K-O-J.  Yeah, because the violence thing wasn't working for him either.  It's not working for me.  So when you think O-K, you think O-J.  Yeah, wonderful.  So why aren't you in the porn industry, Bob?  Yeah.  Well, because, you know, somebody had to go out and make a legit career, you know. 
[01:05:30]  Now, I mean, I didn't really want to do that kind of thing.  I respect totally what my father does.  I don't think it's porn, by the way.  I think it's, you know, no, it's a different kind of thing altogether.  But...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I enjoy Penthouse.  We love it.  And the latest issue, there is some fine porno shots in there.  Well, I've got to say, it has gone a little harder, much harder than it used to be.  Uh, Bob Guccione Jr., do you know what the recipe is for fake, photographed man splooge? 
[01:06:00]  No.  You don't know the recipe?  I don't think I want to.  We just figured it out the other day, or we were told by one of the Penthouse guys that set up the shoots.  It doesn't sound like the food network to me.  It's Cairo syrup, and powdered sugar, and a little water.  Really?  They splooge it on the girl's face, and it looks really authentic.  That's really disgusting. 
[01:06:30]  Let's be honest.  Anyway, I wanted to do a magazine that was kind of like a little more mainstream than that,  and had a sense of humor, and had some fun.  And, you know, we're doing a book that I think is cool.  You guys like it, and I'm very glad about it.  Yes, I do.  I'm enjoying the latest issue, matter of fact.  And then, you know, your mom must be proud, huh?  Yeah, she is, yeah.  My mom might be proud if I was arrested, you know what I mean?  You know, we might be like, sorry, my mom got arrested.  Oh, I'm so proud of you.  You'd have to be, like, really, like the swank territory to outdo your father, though.  Well, I think... 
[01:07:00]  So anything you do is pretty much, you know, that people can be proud of.  Well, thanks.  But you know what I mean?  My mother is proud of me, like your mother is proud of me.  Mothers are proud of me.  O.J.'s mother is proud of him, you know what I mean?  I mean, think about it.  I mean, that's the one thing you can count on in life.  Yeah.  Hopefully, you know.  Hey, Bob, could, you know, Gear Magazine maybe do an article on Opie and Anthony?  I think it's high time.  At least there's a public service as a warning.  Well, I'm going to be sweeping the nation very shortly.  Are you?  We've got to explain to you, we had a huge spread in your dad's magazine. 
[01:07:30]  Fantastic.  Oh.  And, you know, if Gear Magazine would...  Was that with or without fake splurge?  That was without...  Oh, come on.  Like you don't ordinarily.  Like you're not now.  See, I'm thinking, if you put us in Gear, that's a magazine we can bring home and it doesn't  have to be in a little paper bag and everyone in the family can enjoy the article.  Yeah, I had to take the penthouse for Thanksgiving over to my family's house to show them the article.  And, you know, there's the little cousins wanting to look through the magazine and they're seeing  oral sex and some urination, which is fine, you know. 
[01:08:00]  I don't care.  Yeah, it's a bit heavy.  For the little cousins, it's a bit heavy.  I grew up seeing that anyway.  Yeah, well, I think we should do an article on you.  You guys, I think, very much merit the warning to the public at large.  Ah, I like that.  You know what magazine sucks these days?  What's that?  Details.  Oh, it really does, isn't it?  Did you see that?  No, I shouldn't say it, but I kind of agree.  You know, there are some magazines, there are a lot of like... 
[01:08:30]  The state is afraid of having fun.  There are men's magazines that are out there now that are full of some fun stuff.  You can really flip through it and there's some interesting information that's kind of  fun.  And then details used to be kind of fun.  And then I couldn't find one article in it.  It is full of ads.  Well, one of our buddies was running the damn thing, Bob Golan, and then go...  Mark.  Mark.  Mark, when I say Bob, Mark Golan, and he got fired and the magazine went south.  Yeah, he's good.  I like Mark.  He's really good.  Why don't you hire him?  He didn't take himself too seriously. 
[01:09:00]  I wanted to.  I wanted to hire him as a writer.  You know, we already have editors that we, you know, are very happy with.  And then he took a big job somewhere, so, you know, that was the end of that.  But I admire him, respect him, and like him.  And you want to explain to your magazine for the newbies out there?  Yeah, it's essentially a pop culture magazine.  You know, we really cover music very extensively in movies.  And it's a magazine that features the most attractive women in pop culture at the time. 
[01:09:30]  It could be a model.  It could be an actress.  And we additionally have a lot of very, you know, serious investigative articles and interviews.  It just came from a lunch where former Commissioner Howard Safer spoke to a bunch of our clients  because I interviewed him in the March issue.  Quite a long piece.  And, you know, when I did that, some of the staff said,  why are we interviewing a 60-year-old Republican police commissioner?  And I said, because it's an adventure story.  And if you read the piece, it's, you know, cops and robbers and exciting and interesting 
[01:10:00]  and a fascinating look in the world.  And I think the important thing for us is we have confidence the reader can have some dimension.  He can look at a pre-go, and he can also want to read about the underworld.  All right.  And what about the fun stuff?  Oh, it's all fun stuff.  It's all fun stuff.  I like reading the music stuff.  Did you read the music issue with the, we did a piece on, is it possible to kill the Rolling Stones?  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  It was fun, wasn't it?  Is that the latest one with Shirley Manson on the cover?  Yeah, we did three covers.  Shirley Manson on one, and Vitamin C. 
[01:10:30]  There's two different Vitamin C covers.  Right.  Right on.  Hey, speaking of music, what's the deal with Axel in that Get In The Ring song?  Oh, man, I forgot about that.  I know that's going back, but that's definitely an interesting story.  That's 92.  Yeah, he challenged me to a fight, and I accepted, and then he backed down.  Right, Axel.  That's the whole of it, you know?  Yeah, Axel.  There's really no more to it than that, you know?  He wrote a whole song called Get In The Ring.  What was his beef with you at the time?  You know, he's just a guy whose ego is larger than him, which is, by the way, he's not very large.  And at the time when he challenged me to a fight, I said, really, you know, people who are not fully grown 
[01:11:00]  shouldn't challenge fully grown men to fight.  Right.  And he's about 5'1".  Oh, really?  And I'm glad that the fight never came off, because it's ridiculous.  He's too small and light.  Right.  But anyway, he's just egocentric, and if you write anything negative, and we spent at the time  when I was publishing Spin, we published a couple of pieces that kind of put him in a  less than fabulous light.  Well, refresh everyone's memory.  I don't remember what you guys said back then.  Well, what it was was he had a contract, Guns N' Roses, that you had to sign if you wanted 
[01:11:30]  to interview them.  And the contract said they had to approve everything in the interview and all the rest  of it.  So it's just crap.  So a bunch of magazines, of course, editorialized about this.  I said, no, let's not editorialize.  Let's publish the contract.  Right.  And on the cover, we said how to get an interview with Guns N' Roses.  And 10,000 people filled it out and sent it in.  So they got submerged by these requests for this stupid contract.  Because they all came from, like, individuals.  Yeah.  No credible news organization would do it. 
[01:12:00]  Anyway, they got ballistic and they wrote this whole song.  And I said, fine, great, okay.  All right.  So he challenged you, you accepted, and then he backed out.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it was, you know, thank God.  It would have been silly.  I mean, he's really, he's a talented musician who is just too, he's not that talented.  You know, for as full of himself as he is, he ain't that talented.  Yeah.  Are you into music yourself, Bob?  Oh, yeah.  Love it, yeah.  Of all the years of Spin, you know, that I've had to spin, I was, you know, exposed to every kind  of music.  What are you listening to these days? 
[01:12:30]  Mostly Britney Spears.  Sir?  Christine Aguero.  No, I'm teasing.  I had to hear you go.  We're watching her.  I think Britney's very cool, actually.  I think Britney's kind of cool.  Did you see that Pepsi commercial?  Amazing.  Nice.  Absolutely amazing.  She's got the charisma.  She reminds me of Madonna.  Right.  She has the same charisma.  And...  Madonna was never that hot.  Yeah.  I mean, Britney Spears...  And Madonna's a better looking woman.  Madonna's a beautiful woman.  And Britney...  Britney's hot, but not necessarily as good looking as Madonna. 
[01:13:00]  Like, years ago, when Madonna was doing the conversion thing and all that, and she would  dress up, never looked as hot as Britney looks, with the little shorts and the little belly  shirts and stuff, side of the boob shot on the new video.  Well, this is where I think, you know, we have the difference of opinion.  I think Madonna's very hot.  But then I'm older than you boys.  She's hot, but I mean...  Hey, I wasn't, you know, Britney kind of...  We'd all throw her one, but I think, you know, Britney is so much hotter.  Christina Aguilera signed with Coca-Cola, by the way. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, because Britney Spears has got the Pepsi, and now Christina Aguilera is doing the Coke  commercials.  Right.  She's got to outdo it now.  I swear they're going to...  We'll be doing the...  We can only hope for a real soda battle between the two girls, where they end up having to  just impale themselves on Coke and Pepsi cans.  It's got to get to that point.  Why don't we get those two in a ring?  What do you think, Bob?  Dare to dream. 
[01:14:00]  I think we can only but dare to dream, exactly.  Would that be the greatest pay-per-view ever, if it was Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera  mud wrestling in a ring?  Oh, yeah.  You know, that would certainly probably break all records.  Yeah.  I think you're onto something, guys.  Madonna.  You're wasted on the radio.  You're impisarius.  Yes, yes.  You're bigger than this.  Look at this West Coast Dave saying, Madonna circa 83, hotter than Britney.  No way.  No.  What's this?  A guy checking in on the instant.  A guy agreeing with you.  Yeah, that's good.  I don't get it.  There's your time. 
[01:14:30]  Vox Populi.  You know, the people have spoken.  Yeah.  All right, Bob.  That's my credibility gone, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now I just don't even want to talk to you.  I don't blame you.  I don't blame you.  I don't even want to talk to myself anymore.  Well, Bob, thank you so much for our prize.  You're very welcome.  For the best ask.  Wait, really fast.  Harry Sack from Hicksville writes, you guys have to ask Bob why he believes HIV doesn't cause AIDS.  Oh, well, it's a good question.  I'll give you a very quick answer. 
[01:15:00]  Rather than drag you for a long, long description.  First of all, I've never taken a position.  He's referring to the spin column on AIDS we ran for 10 years.  We never took the position that it absolutely doesn't.  We took the position that no one's proven it does.  And it's a big difference.  But it's an important distinction nonetheless.  No scientific paper anywhere in the world has ever declaratively said this is how HIV causes AIDS.  It's thought to cause AIDS. 
[01:15:30]  It's presumed to cause AIDS.  And it's treated as the cause of AIDS.  But the actual fact that most people, certainly most people listening to your show probably don't know, that it has never been proven.  And in all viral science, people almost never attempt to, you know, address a disease until they've proven the exact and absolute cause.  Oh, let's get to back to banging then.  Yeah.  Unprotected sex for everyone.  Well, if you think about it, and this is, again, incredibly politically incorrect thing to say, but there has been, and I believe there never will be, a heterosexual AIDS epidemic. 
[01:16:00]  And almost invariably, if not completely, heterosexual AIDS cases are another risk factor.  They are usually drug abusers or sometimes they're HIV positive people who go on AIDS medicine, and the medicine itself can diminish the immune system.  But you never, ever hear, and I challenge your listeners to provide evidence to you guys when I get off the air, but you never hear of a case where a guy who's not in any other risk factor has contracted AIDS. 
[01:16:30]  You do hear of them contracting HIV and not developing AIDS, and you hear of women contracting HIV heterosexually, but the majority of them, if they don't treat it, never go to AIDS.  If they treat it, they get sick.  So we don't know yet all of the things we need to know, and I've always resisted the absoluteness of the certainties that HIV does cause AIDS.  And, Bob, cigarettes has nothing to do with that cancer stuff, right? 
[01:17:00]  Cigarettes are good for you.  Yes.  I thought so.  No, I'm not a smoker.  I'm not a smoker.  But I tell you, I think we know more about cigarettes than we do about AIDS, and that's a fact that most people don't realize.  If people realize how little is known, how little is conclusively known, how much we're shooting in the dark, they'd be more worried.  So like cigarettes, just keep the things out of your mouth, and you'll be okay.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  So unprotected sex, good.  Cigarettes, very good.  Now, unprotected sex is a different thing. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, you know, there's an awful lot of other stuff out there.  Right.  They'd be more worried about, frankly.  I've got much more fear of, you know, other sexually transmitted diseases.  The herp.  I don't want that.  The herp?  You don't hear about the herp anymore.  And, guys, now, when you get those nude bartenders, you be careful, boys.  Oh, we will.  Some of those are not clean women.  Well, you just got to, you take some of the vodka they're serving, you dump it in their lap, and everything's cured.  That stuff kill anything.  Right?  I don't know which is going to hurt you, the vodka or them.  Jaeger vag shots. 
[01:18:00]  Everybody, line up.  Nice.  Well, Bob Guccione, Jr., thank you very much.  Oh, pleasure, guys.  Thank you for the trip, and thanks for spending some time with us.  Take care.  Have a good time.  All right, cool.  Cheers.  Thank you.  Cheers.  Hip, hip, cheerio.  Check out Gear Magazine, Anthony.  What a theory he's got there.  But, you know, you do rarely hear the AIDS being transmitted just completely heterosexually.  Hey, guys, the nude bartenders are here. 
[01:18:30]  What's this?  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Jesus H. Christ on a pony.  Oh, no, no.  You know, it's...  We're supposed to get new bartenders instead.  I'm staring at the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Tell them to just go home.  I thought they were supposed to come in tomorrow.  No, because some...  Oh, we did.  We...  Oh, damn it.  Like, someone told them that we were going on vacation Friday.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe we can...  We've been saying that all week.  Great.  Maybe we could give Lady Di a version of Scared Straight for her job. 
[01:19:00]  We'll have to tell her about the co-worker that got in touch with us and told us that she is in grave danger...  Do we still have that email?  ...of losing her job.  All right, we're going to find that email?  Yes.  We've got to talk to Ray just before we take a break here.  Ray, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, listen.  First one, for Bob, how about John Holmes?  Johnny the Wad Hump.  He's in porno, and he was doing drugs, intravenous drugs, and he was having gay sex. 
[01:19:30]  Dude.  That would do it.  Yeah, that might do it.  That covers all the bases.  And, oh, yeah, he was doing shots of AIDS blood.  That's pretty much the only other thing that he didn't do.  Listen, I love these guys you're going to vacation.  You know what happened last time?  The whole radio station got turned around.  Yeah, you know what?  A lot of people thought that was fake.  When all that went down, when we got back from vacation, it was as real as it gets.  Matter of fact, we all went to lunch today, and we promised each other that we wanted to 
[01:20:00]  F up just before vacation so we could enjoy ourselves for the next year.  I think you should get Gay Markle here for a couple days.  No, we're going to be very good boys today, because I want to leave with a clear head.  Good luck, guys, and have a good time.  All right.  Bye, Ray.  Bye.  Pete Best is here, and the retarded Laverne and Shirley, and no nude bartenders yet.  And we are getting epped on our last day before vacation.  God damn it.  And Kimmy from Survivor on the way.  Oh, God, no, you can't come in.  She's talking to me through the goddamn glass. 
[01:20:30]  Get me a gun.  Get me a gun.  I'll take anything, even a deuce-deuce.  Where's Puffy?  No, get the...  You know what?  And I will laugh my, you know what, off.  What?  If you chase the retarded Laverne and Shirley with a big, huge Gallagher hammer.  Go get the Gallagher hammer.  No, no, you know why?  Because I will hit one of them with it.  That's what I'll laugh at.  I'll hit one of them.  But you think I'm laughing because...  You might hit them?  No, I want to laugh because you're hitting them.  We're getting the hammer.  You think I like giving that one woman half of my money? 
[01:21:00]  That'd be great.  I'd hit her.  I'd have to give her money, too.  And I wouldn't F that with the other one's D.  Hey, you know what?  We've got to get this call in the air because I think Bob Guccioni Jr. pissed off a lot of people.  Patty, what's up?  You know, I'm really going nuts here.  Here I am.  What's up?  I got out of work.  I just got out of teaching a bunch of adolescents about HIV and AIDS.  And he gets on the radio and says that HIV has not been proven to lead to AIDS. 
[01:21:30]  It's not drugs or something.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with him?  He said it's never been proven to...  Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's not the cause of AIDS.  Wait, wait.  They just haven't officially proven it.  Okay, they haven't officially proven it.  So all this stuff that, you know, we read in not just articles, but in scientific journals  that say that HIV, the cause of AIDS, that's not, you know...  Well, he didn't say that isn't the case.  It couldn't, in fact, be the case that HIV does cause AIDS. 
[01:22:00]  But it just hasn't been scientifically proven.  But everyone knows it does.  He's just saying that there isn't a document proving it.  But you've got this guy saying also that, you know, heterosexual contact is not going  to, you know...  Very rarely does a heterosexual contact...  He said that it's almost impossible that there will be an epidemic of heterosexual AIDS.  So how do you explain the rising numbers in women?  I mean, where is that...  Well, you know why? 
[01:22:30]  Because there's AIDS out there.  We're all a bunch of drug addicts, right?  No, no, no.  You've got to stop having that butt sex.  And what's the rising...  What's the stats on the rising AIDS in women?  Oh, God.  You know, I wish that I had it on me right now.  I'm actually driving.  Yeah, you know what the problem is?  Statistics are very deceiving sometimes because I hear things like,  oh, there's a 100% increase in women's AIDS.  If four of them had it and four more got it, there's your 100%. 
[01:23:00]  But in reality, only eight of them have it.  Okay, well, let me ask you something.  Here's a statistic I know off the top of my head.  Oh, right.  And this is according to a White House report, okay?  Yes.  Between...  Under the age of 24, there are two people infected every single hour.  Are they all drug addicts?  Under 24 where?  In the United States.  Here in the United States.  Two people infected every single hour.  Well, stay away from the butt.  You've got to steer clear of that buttock region. 
[01:23:30]  That's what it is.  That's all it is.  Okay.  You do understand.  I'm teasing with you.  It's a sewer pump for diseases.  It's the old disease hole.  Oh, my God.  You guys always make me laugh.  I love your show.  And it's just that you really infuriated me.  I actually was having palpitations.  You've got to watch those palpitations.  They lead to AIDS.  You know, I don't think we were taking them that seriously about that. 
[01:24:00]  No, I know you guys weren't, but there are other people out there that might actually buy into his nonsense.  And I would really like to use another word.  Say it.  Don't say...  Did you say the bull S word?  I guess that's the word I would say.  You can't say that on the air.  I told her to say it.  All right, Patty.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Africa ravaged by AIDS.  Earl, what's going on in the motherland?  Hey, they can't hear us outside, right?  No.  All right.  Good.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Can I take a break?  Uh-huh. 
[01:24:30]  All right, Rick, shut the door.  They can't hear us?  There's no audio.  What are you doing?  Oh, you got it set up, Ronnie?  Uh-huh.  Oh, you put a mic outside?  Yeah.  The retard, Laverne and Shirley are horrifying.  Pete Best.  Are they drunk?  I didn't enter.  Got to get the mic closer.  Be subtle with it.  Don't let them onto the fence.  Oh, I was.  Okay.  Tell me you went through. 
[01:25:00]  Uh-oh.  I'm going to puke.  No, we're just setting up for when the bartenders get here.  Okay.  Ah, good one, Rick.  I thought it was, I thought it was, I thought it was Michael.  Are they on record now?  Hey, Rick, who won the backhand card?  Who won the backhand card?  Listen to this babble.  We know Patty wasn't the final one.  This babbling is.  I want that backhand.  I got to talk to my friend.  I got to talk to my friend. 
[01:25:30]  Cool.  Hi, how's it going?  What?  What?  What's up, Rick?  They teach your rules.  I bet you Pete called him.  Pete called him.  Not you.  Not you.  How would he, how would he call him?  Yeah, Pete Best called him.  Everybody gets it.  Oh, nice.  Who calls up, uh, and said that he was not with that definitely.  What's worse for Pete Best, Opie?  Not being in the Beatles by, uh, missing being in the Beatles, the most popular band ever on the face of the earth, or having to sit in a room with the retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[01:26:00]  I said, I said, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Worse than missing out on the Beatles portion.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Her job is not.  Rick.  Rick.  Rick, send him up.  Say, uh, Opie and Anthony want to know what you guys are going to be talking about today.  I think we'll be doing like a pre-interview or something.  I can't deal with this.  Lifting something too heavy.  What?  Lifting something too heavy.  Case of the beer.  Poor Pete Best.  Sort of.  Sort of in a hockey.  I have a mic holder.  Yeah.  Um, can you just hold this for a second? 
[01:26:30]  Sure.  Do you know, uh, what you girls are going to be talking about when you come in?  Uh, not really.  What do you want to talk about?  My birthday.  My birthday's coming up.  We just came by to visit them for our birthday.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know.  And that was the way he talked about my job.  Yeah, who calls up and sits and complaining that she may lose her job?  Who said that?  Oh, we got an email.  An email from who?  I don't know.  Jim.  From Jim? 
[01:27:00]  What did they do?  Oh, I thought you were talking to me.  Okay.  It was Jim.  I know what Jim works there, but I don't know.  Did you guys meet Pete Best yet?  Oh, yeah, we did.  I bet you take the one.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Matter of fact, I saw pictures of him a long, long time ago.  Dude, he looks like he doesn't know what the hell is going on.  He's just taking it all in.  Pete Best.  Yeah.  I've been a fan of the Beatles for many, many years.  That's what Pete wants to hear. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he wasn't in the...  He was in the Beatles for, like, a month before they...  How did I get the nice haircut last week?  Who gave it to me?  A place in Westfield.  It's nice.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Oh.  Can you meet Kimmy from Survivor?  The big Beatles show.  Oh, hi.  How are you doing?  Hi.  Nice meeting you.  Poor Kimmy.  She'll never survive this.  Call me, ladies and gentlemen.  I haven't followed the Survivor series.  Kimmy wants to be voted off the show right now.  Actually, one beer.  Because Monday's her birthday. 
[01:28:00]  So I took her out for her birthday.  Yeah, one beer.  We had one.  She'll be a place I don't know if we went.  A keg.  It's pretty good.  Very good.  Very good.  Very nice person.  Very nice place to eat.  Mm-hmm.  Small place, though.  Just really small.  It's very big.  It's intimate.  It's a fun family restaurant.  Shut up.  It's a really nice place.  Do I show the pictures of everybody over there?  They want to show me.  They're just retarded.  I don't think the P-Best is just out there.  He's just, like, mesmerized.  You can just see in his eyes.  P-Best is going to take a drumstick and shove it through his heart. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, he's laughing at him.  He's laughing at him?  You know, it's not Wednesday.  No, no.  Are you really Kimmy from Survivor?  Are you from the first Survivor or the Survivor now?  No, I'm from Survivor Australia, but I'm really not Kimmy.  Oh, you're a Swirlian outback.  Actually, I really seriously never followed the series.  I don't watch it.  You freaking retarded.  I don't watch it.  I don't follow it.  I didn't even follow the first one.  Follow what?  The Survivor Series. 
[01:29:00]  Why?  The Survivor Series.  It's WWF.  No, I don't have a brother.  No, I don't.  No, I don't have any brothers.  I have a brother.  She does.  His brother's name is Bobby.  Elder or younger?  He's younger than me.  Listen to this conversation.  Yeah, you could say that, I guess.  What does he look like?  He doesn't look like you, I hope. 
[01:29:30]  What do you mean, you hope?  He would look like a girl.  Okay.  That's right.  Oh, my face.  He's a very good, handsome man.  Very good-looking man.  Why?  I just wanted to know, because we couldn't make the last one.  Huh?  When's the next road show?  Yeah, when is the next road show?  We never heard anyone.  Road show.  Road what?  Road show.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who couldn't make the last one?  We couldn't make it, because we live in Jersey, so we couldn't get to Long Island. 
[01:30:00]  More provides for Jersey right there.  I don't think so.  They are also so stupid, because Richard has the microphone.  He's just, like, standing there like this.  Of course.  Have it somewhere around here, Manhattan.  You can have it in Staten Island.  We'll plan a road show around New York.  Public transportation, baby.  Yeah, well, we drive, but it's just that, you know, the weather and everything that day.  Can't get on the bus.  No dogs allowed.  Go ahead, Marion. 
[01:30:30]  What?  Tell us the reasons why we can't go.  We couldn't go to Long Island.  Often.  We don't know how to get there.  We don't know how to get there.  It's all right.  Right, right.  You know, it's a right and a right and a right.  Yeah, from where to where to where, though.  From New Jersey?  We live in Jersey.  Did you just set off the howl on and just suffocate them in there?  From where to where to where to where to where to where?  From what?  What?  From where to where to where?  Really?  You get on this way to Long Island Expressway.  I don't know nothing about Long Island Expressway.  You don't know nothing about nothing.  It's a winding road.  Oh, the holly.  I mean, did it have to get to the road show to Long Island Expressway or whatever? 
[01:31:00]  I don't know.  I thought something's on that direction.  I don't know where the band is going.  Yeah, we didn't know where it was.  That's why we didn't go.  That's why we didn't go.  We didn't know where to go.  We didn't know.  Which way were you going to go?  We weren't going to go anywhere because we didn't know where to go.  Can you guys invite us to the next one?  Yeah, we'll make the next one.  We don't know nothing about Long Island Expressway.  We don't know nothing about Long Island Expressway.  We'll take a break. 
[01:31:30]  Jesus.  The last time I was there was 1980 for the Nassau Coliseum to see Billy Joel.  That was the last time I was there.  The Piano Man?  Yes.  She's thinking.  1980.  I'm a big fan of years, too.  So if you had your next road show like in Manhattan, anywhere.  A road?  Show.  A road show.  You would have it somewhere in Manhattan. 
[01:32:00]  Well, even if you had it in Staten Island, Hoboken, you know, who knows?  Where should we have it?  We're Hawken.  Have it in Wehawken.  What's a Wehawken?  Have it in Hoboken.  Trash.  Do you hear her?  Have it in Staten Island.  It's a drunken ring card.  Or there's a city.  It's a city.  How was there?  About a week ago?  No, I don't remember.  I live a few blocks away from there.  Thank God.  We know that now.  No, I live over the Goffles Bridge.  I had something to do that.  Jump off the Goffles Bridge. 
[01:32:30]  Could you please?  I had something to do that Friday that you were there.  Ranger game.  This is their life.  Here it is.  On a plate for all of you to enjoy.  Goffles Bridge?  Because I think it was close to that, right?  Goffles, yeah.  Goffles?  What?  Goffles Bridge.  I take the Goffles Bridge.  And then I go to the Van of Zymo.  Oh, thank you.  I'm sure you know how to get to Staten Island.  The Lufraigna Bridge to the Goffles Bridge to the Outer Bridge to Bing Crosby. 
[01:33:00]  The Verrazano.  The Verrazano Bridge.  The Verrazano, the Vatican Bridge to the Goffles Bridge to the Outer Bing Crosby.  To the Jersey Pipe Cleaner.  And then we'd only be the Goffles Bridge.  The Goffles Bridge.  I know exactly where it was.  But if you're on Long Island, you'd take the Big Road Bridge.  The Lincoln Lock Tunnel.  I don't know anything about Long Island.  I'd take the Harlem Tunnel.  It was a Thursday night, and we had to go to work the next day.  When did you get to Long Island when you were taking the park ride?  I didn't even want to go. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  I'm Frank Coffrey.  I thought.  The Lufraig does all that.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Opie.  Now they're on to us, so I don't want to hear it.  Anthony, we've got to take a break.

One at a time.  Here comes the troll now. 
[01:36:30]  Look at her waddling her way into the studio like a penguin.  I got a soft compliment.  The penguin with a blonde wig.  I got a soft compliment.  The penguin.  The penguin with a blonde wig.  I don't look like a penguin.  Oh, penguin.  That's it.  That's it.  Okay.  Penguin with a blonde wig.  What's a penguin?  Shumley?  She's adorable. 
[01:37:00]  I was thinking more like the Danny DeVito penguin.  Oh, my God.  How you guys been?  Hey, Marion.  What do you know about Diamond Vision and Dr. Philafel?  Because you listen so closely to this radio show.  Actually, nothing.  Nothing?  You wear glasses.  Wouldn't you like to?  Let's see you without your glasses on.  Take the glasses off.  Wow.  Nice.  You can never wear too much blue eyeshadow.  Which one?  Very nice.  Nothing.  You can never wear too much, I always say.  Let me take a look at you.  Do you wear makeup? 
[01:37:30]  What?  No.  Let me take a look at you.  Do you wear makeup when you had the XFL tapings?  And I loved the blue eyeshadow.  I wore it all the time.  Hey, Marion.  Move over.  Move over.  I want to see that hot face of yours.  Take your glasses off.  Yeah.  Take those glasses off again.  Look at this.  It's a big difference.  Come here.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  I'm a little bit fat.  I want to ask you.  Straighten our teeth and you'll be a lesser.  What's a lesser man?  Go off the air for a minute.  No?  No, you're not off the air.  That's on air.  Boy, we can't trick you. 
[01:38:00]  No, you guys can't trick me.  You guys should know that when you gave me and Diane our own radio show in January.  You can't pull out an old woman.  We can never pull anything off on you.  No, you can't.  I've got to ask you guys a serious question.  Off air?  Yeah.  All right.  If you guys can.  Watch me turn off the mics.  Here we go.  Point, point, point, point.  I'll even take my headphones off.  Put the music on so the listeners get to listen.  I would like to have your headphones on.  Look, my headphones are off.  I'd like to go. 
[01:38:30]  We'll be right back.  A serious question.  Hurry.  The music's playing and the listeners get to listen.  No, Anthony, for real.  No, we're off.  Go ahead.  What?  Who emailed you guys and told you guys about Diane's job?  No, that's not on.  What?  Who emailed you guys and told you guys about Diane's job may be on the line?  Oh, her job being in Jeopardy.  Yeah.  Who told you?  We got an email from somebody that works with her.  What happened?  What did the email say?  They say that she's like...  She's like a nervous wreck, actually.  Yeah, well, supposedly she's so into Anthony that she, like, carries around a transistor 
[01:39:00]  radio with a nerve piece.  I don't know what happens at her job.  She's supposed to be working.  She's obsessed with this show, and what happens is she has the transistor radio.  She's shirking her responsibility.  See, I don't work with her, so I don't know what goes on.  That's what I've heard.  All I know is that she heard her back a few weeks ago, and I don't believe her that she  got hurt on her job.  That's the only thing I know.  I don't think it is.  I don't think it has to do with that.  I think it has to do with that.  No, she moved something that was a little too heavy, obviously, if you moved so heavy.  For herself? 
[01:39:30]  Wow, we're all there.  We're all there.  No, Anthony, no.  You?  She did.  No, she moved something.  She moved something that was a little too heavy for her.  Right.  Obviously, what I do for a living, I lift heavy stuff, too.  You do?  But I do.  But if something's too heavy for me, no, so what?  I lost five pounds in the last month.  Woo!  Oh, yeah?  So, I'm still losing.  Marion, the music's still playing.  Yeah, we've got to get back to the air.  Yeah, we've got to get back to the air.  Somebody...  Sometimes you lift something too heavy, and you damage yourself.  All right. 
[01:40:00]  Damage yourself.  What do you do?  All right.  Listen, we've got to get back to the air.  I don't think it's going to get any more damage than it already is.  I just wanted to ask you an email.  All right.  We're back on the air?  Take on...  Hey, Anthony, it's her birthday, too.  We're back on the air.  We're back on the air.  We're back on the air, Marion.  Can you please give her a hug?  Happy birthday.  We'll do that.  Thank you.  All right.  Like you said earlier, we can't trick you, obviously.  No.  You're on to us.  That's awful.  Anthony, Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  Yes, Opie.  You had this done.  And now, like a curse, you can see better right now. 
[01:40:30]  You can't tell anybody.  I want to put daggers in my eyes.  Repeat after me.  What?  Dr. Philotoff.  Dr. Philotoff.  Oh, not bad.  Hey, there you go.  Look at that.  She pronounced an A, finally.  Hey, expressway.  Uh, no, no.  Expressway, okay?  All right.  Wait outside in the green room.  All right.  I want to ask you guys, what are you doing in your next wheelchair?  I don't know.  We're going on vacation.  I know you guys are going.  What are you guys doing?  Are you going to be our naked bartenders today?  No, we ain't. 
[01:41:00]  I'm not going to be a naked bartender.  No?  I could be a bartender, but not naked bartender.  All right.  I will not trick you.  All right.  There she goes.  There ain't enough booze.  A blonde wig.  Ain't enough booze.  The penguin with a blonde wig.  You frigging killed me with that one.  Well, no.  All I pictured was the penguin with a blonde wig, and it was right there in front of me.  Anthony, what can we tell the people about Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff?  Well, if there's something out there that you do want to see, you'll be able to see it without glasses. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  I wanted to wear your old glasses so I couldn't see, but you smashed them after you had the procedure done.  Yeah.  Dr. Philotoff.  I hope he did all the research.  And this is the guy to go through 6,000 surgeries, Harvard and Yale trained.  You don't want to go to some fly-by-night operation that is doing these surgeries now, because a lot of them are.  Dr. Philotoff, an expert.  For residents of Long Island, New Jersey, and the five boroughs, the LASIK procedure, only $750 per eye.  Right now, if you live somewhere else, Diamond Vision still offers LASIK for only $12.50 per eye. 
[01:42:00]  But if you live in the area, you're getting a hell of a discount.  There are lower prices around, but this offer won't last forever.  So, oh, these are the lowest prices around.  What a dick.  This offer won't last forever.  So call 1-800-984-2020.  1-800-984-2020.  Take Opie's word for it.  God gave him two eyes, but there's only one choice to fix him.  Diamond Vision.  1-800-984-2020.  This segment of Opie and Anthony is brought to you by Toyota of Hackensack, 278 River Street, Hackensack, New Jersey. 
[01:42:30]  Sports in the morning.  The sports guys!  Lots more show to go, Anthony.  In just a few minutes, Pete Best.  Yeah.  Coming in to say hi.  He almost was in the Beatles.  I think Lady Di is speaking with Pete Best right now, and I think Rick went out.  That's how I told him.  I said, I lift heavy stuff, too, where I was.  But, you know.  They gave us a long radio show, as I was saying.  In January, we were up here. 
[01:43:00]  For Martin Luther King Day, a holiday that we were.  It was funny.  And people were calling in, asking us questions.  I'm the person.  That person will always tell you where to go.  I told all these callers that called me.  My ass.  My ass.  I told them.  I told them to go.  I am not the type of person.  And they try to play a trick on me in there, and I know their tricks.  I said, no, no.  You ain't gonna play a trick on me.  I said, because I know your tricks.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  I gave it back to them. 
[01:43:30]  They laugh at me.  They think we're cool.  They think we're cool?  I have to talk about my job.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  They think I'm cool.  When you think of Lady Di, how far down the list, and Marianne, how far down the list  before you get to the word cool?  Anthony, I think she's just below age, as far as the cool list goes.  Before cool, mucus membrane would pop up before cool.  She goes, I'm on to their tricks.  They were trying to play a trick on me in there, but I'm on. 
[01:44:00]  No.  I'm on to their tricks.  I don't know, but I'm going to take him.  They wanted to hope he could be nude boy tenders.  Hey, Rick, what happened to you?  Why did she not insulting me for?  You don't insult me.  You insult yourself.  Hey, Ben, what happened to your nude boy tenders?  Shh.  Ben will just say, shut up, you effing whore.  All right.  Anyway, Anthony.  Ah, can you tell it's the day before vacation for the O&A show?  Poor Pete Best, man.  There's a guy. 
[01:44:30]  Had to live his whole life thinking, I was in the Beatles right up until they hit, and  it's the Beatles.  Just tons of money for everybody.  Right.  And here it is, the year 2001, and he's sitting, listening to that babble.  Mwah.  Worse than Yocum.  By the way.  Worse than having to sit and listen to Yocum.  By the way, Kimmy's here from Survivor.  All I'm hearing now is how hot this chick Kimmy is.  I haven't seen her.  Everyone else is taking a look through the glass or something. 
[01:45:00]  CBS screwed this chick.  She is so hot in person.  It's not...  Stink?  You ever hear stink like this, Ann?  I know.  Everyone's like, oh my God, she is smoking.  She really is.  Nice and tall.  Tall and thin and...  Man.  Kelly, how hot is Kimmy?  Not as hot as Mario, I know.  Not as hot as Mario.  But she's hot, right?  Yeah, she's hot.  There you go.  Anthony, the WWF pay-per-view is coming Sunday. 
[01:45:30]  We're talking about WrestleMania.  WrestleMania 17, sponsored by Snickers.  They have over 65,000 WWF fans to witness WrestleMania live from Houston's Astrodome.  The Astrodome.  The World Wrestling Federation.  Yes, WrestleMania 17, sponsored by Snickers.  Over 65,000 fans will witness WrestleMania from Houston.  Face it turning red.  Face it turning red.  WWF champion The Rock faces Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF championship. 
[01:46:00]  In an epic battle between the two biggest WWF superstars of all time.  Oh, you say really good.  And his father and son family feud as WWF owner Vince McMahon and the new WCW owner Shane McMahon  meet in an emotional and intense street fight like you've never seen.  Rascally rabbit.  Rascally rabbit.  Last week, a sledgehammer to the skull by Triple H left 16 staples in The Undertaker's forehead.  Now The Undertaker is looking for revenge.  These two WWF superstars will take brutality to a whole new level. 
[01:46:30]  At WrestleMania.  And last year, at SummerSlam, the Dudley Boys, the Hardy Boys, the Edge, and Christian  shocked the world in the most electrifying tag team tables, ladders, and chairs match ever seen.  I don't want to go see WrestleMania.  This time, we guarantee the sequel to be better than the original.  I don't want to go see WWF.  I don't want to go see WWF.  I don't want to go see WWF.  With tables, ladders, and chairs, too.  That's good enough.  I'm a WCW fan.  I don't want to go see WWF.  What happened to the place the other night?  You should have known.  What happened? 
[01:47:00]  I missed it.  He took over to WCW.  That's a big man.  Shane McMahon came in.  Shane said that he took over to WCW.  No.  So where was it the other night?  It was on Monday night?  I'm going to hang myself.  Shane McMahon is going to go to WCW.  You said that in one year.  But he didn't go to WCW.  No.  He took it right there.  There's too much going on out there.  Lady Di goes,  So did you do any more?  Did you do any other music after the Beatles?  After the Beatles. 
[01:47:30]  Smoke.  Make sure there's no unlocked windows because he will jump.  I don't know.  You don't follow us on.  Besides WWF, you people don't follow us on.  He doesn't know.  Sticky, what's your real name?  What's your real name?  You've asked me this eight times.  It's great.  What's your name drunk all the time?  You've asked me this.  I'm not drunk.  I can smell it.  You smell what?  The alcohol.  We had beer.  We had beer.  Actually, let me tell you.  Monday is her birthday. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  We took a beer.  I took a beer to Joey Paisano's.  She had two beers at Joey Paisano's.  I never took a beer to Paisano's.  Joey Paisano's.  Okay.  But you know what?  They didn't give us their free glass of wine.  They did not give us their free glass of wine.  I'm cut off.  I'm too drunk.  Yeah, we wanted to.  You know what?  You're not going to believe it.  I'm naturally like this.  Joey Paisano's.  Joey Paisano's.  Joey Paisano's.  Joey Paisano's.  She can't even say Paisano's.  I don't drink Paisano's.  We want to say Paisano's.  It looks a nice Spandex pant jam.  How about my pants?  Try to try to marry it. 
[01:48:30]  I'm all friggin' stinking the gym.  Hey, you know when you lose weight, your pants get looser on you.  Yeah, well, give it a try then.  Sorry, dude.  You didn't say anything about my best.  She's laughing hysterically.  Any best?  I lost weight.  Pete Best probably thinks he's on a candid effing camera or something.  We put Pete Best, former drummer for the Beatles, in the waiting room of a radio station  with two babbling idiots.  Laugh along as he goes insane as Blaney, Die, and Marion act like two effing effing 
[01:49:00]  C-bitch, stupid-ass bitches.  Fanny Flag never makes an appearance.  I've been working out.  I've been working out.  Let the sweat out.  I've been working out.  I've been working.  Watch yourself.  I've been working and doing my Power Rider.  Working food out of your fridge into your mouth.  Ben, tell Stinky to your viewers on this.  It's too good.  That I have.  What kind of mic?  Anthony, what else about WrestleMania? 
[01:49:30]  Please don't miss the first ever gimmick battle royal featuring WWF legends, Sergeant  Slaughter, Brother Love, Iron Sheik, Hillbilly Jim, Nikolai Volkov, and many others in a contest  unlike any other in Federation history.  But I haven't had it for six, seven, no.  Eight years.  You can tell.  It keeps you on.  I've been using it.  No, you look pretty built and soft.  You're getting ready for the summer bikini.  No.  No?  No.  No bikini for me.  I'm going to Florida in September. 
[01:50:00]  You should wear a phone.  You have a nice hand.  You got the butt now.  You worked off to five pounds.  Yeah, I was.  I'm losing more.  You're such a big butt.  My God.  Yeah.  It was the winner.  I didn't know Patty entered.  Patty entered.  You got your glasses, right?  All right.  Anyway, Anthony.  WrestleMania is going to be great this Sunday on pay-per-view, right?  Yeah.  Pay-per-view this Sunday, 8 p.m.  Check your local, or call your local cable vision pay-per-view rep to order now.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  Well, what about brunettes? 
[01:50:30]  No, brunettes.  Yeah.  What?  You're brunettes.  You're brunettes.  You're brunettes.  You're brunettes.  You're brunettes.  You're brunettes, though.  It's like a Moe Howard type of thing.  Yeah, you are.  You're brunettes.  You got a Moe Howard haircut, he says.  All the time.  There you go.  There they say.  There you go.  It's a nice vest, too.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  This is like my natural color, anyway.  She doesn't like...  This is like my natural color.  They lost five pounds.  What are you doing?  The scale, then.  I'm not telling nobody how much I weigh. 
[01:51:00]  I'll tell you.  When I come back here in June, I'm going to tell you I'm going to be down 25 pounds between  now and June.  I'll probably be down a couple pounds, too.  Look, I'll be down a couple pounds, too.  Yeah, me, too, boss.  Me, too.  Because I will tell you.  Between now and June, I have lost 25 to 30 pounds.  Me, too.  Me, too, boss.  Because I lost 40 pounds two years ago.  Bah.  But then I gained it back, a little bit back.  A little bit?  I had surgery in December.  What are you now like? 
[01:51:30]  So when I had the surgery, I gained that.  Are you 115?  Somewhere around there.  No.  Oh, here we go.  All right, we've got to finish our break and get this whole mess into the studio.

Pete Best.  First of all, 
[01:53:00]  hey Pete, before you do anything,  please allow us to apologize.  You had to sit out there  with what we call the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh my God, you've got to be kidding.  Good company.  Thank you, too.  Please.  Oh my God.  All right, yeah, let Kimmy come in here.  Yeah, get Kimmy in here.  Kimmy, come here.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Kimmy, hey.  Kimmy!  What's up?  Look at this.  Oh my God, thank God.  Wow, you are so hot in person. 
[01:53:30]  What did that TV show do to you?  They didn't let me clean that.  They did you a grave injustice.  We can't even tell that you stink.  Well, I stunk on the show.  I was dirty.  Dirty, yes.  Dirty.  Filthy.  Dirty.  You had like dirty marks all over your body, though.  I know, because I was working hard.  Yeah.  I was making fire and boiling water.  I had to carry the jugs around here.  Right.  Yes, you did.  Yes, I did.  I cannot believe how hot you are.  Is that a bad thing?  It's a great thing. 
[01:54:00]  I mean, what do you think, Pete?  Stinky usually doesn't comment, but today he's been, Stinky's been running around going,  Dude, you got to see Kimmy.  She's so hot.  Right, Stinky?  Thanks, Stinky.  Everyone's freaking out.  Everyone's just like, Oh my God, Kimmy is smoking.  But then again, the retarded Laverne and Shirley are pretty hot in their own right.  I love God.  Please.  Can you believe them?  Because you know what?  Because I've heard them, but I've never seen them.  Yeah.  And they come in, and they're like, Oh, you're Kimmy.  Hi.  Like a little troll.  I know you.  She's like, Ladies, I went, It's a little troll. 
[01:54:30]  They're like little troll people.  By the way, Kimmy is up on the Stinky camp.  Sorry, Pete, but we want to show everybody Kimmy and not write yourself there.  This nomen's your interview, so you just do whatever you want.  Very nice.  So, Pete, did you have a nice conversation with the retarded Laverne and Shirley out there?  What are your images of those two?  Yes, just about that.  Yeah.  Retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  That about sums it up.  Yeah.  There's nothing else to say.  I apologize, because they're out there, and we had a mic on out there, so we were listening 
[01:55:00]  to the conversations, and just the retarded stuff you've got to listen to.  I'll take that to the first place.  I'll take it to the Godfall Bridge.  The Godfall Bridge.  The other being cross me.  And the Vamintana Bridge.  So, we're going to get Pete out of here in like a minute, so...  So, Pete, here he is.  Here's the guy who was the drummer for the Beatles right before the Beatles broke and came  to the U.S. and got huge. 
[01:55:30]  And I'm sure a lot of people have asked you over the years, how do you deal with that,  and how have you gotten through that?  Because you've got to think, there's Lotto right there.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  And, well, over the years, was there a point where you were really bitter, and then you  got over it?  How did you deal with that?  No, it's one of those things that happens in show business all the time, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Well, sure.  But it just happened to be my luck that it was the Beatles.  Yeah.  No, I mean, there's a lot of good things which come out of Liverpool.  They were one of them. 
[01:56:00]  And there's a lot of good people in Liverpool that stick by you.  Yeah.  I think it was through the family and all the rest of it.  You get over it.  But when you're totally like, you must have been pissed off for a while.  Like, God damn, it was my band.  Well, I was drunk, yeah.  Yeah, right?  He was drunk for about two decades.  Did you just like drink?  No, actually, it was three decades.  Three decades.  You sound like Lady Di.  She's working on her third decade, I think.  Does Paul sneak you a check every once in a while because he feels so bad about it? 
[01:56:30]  No.  I would.  With all the money he has?  The only check which Paul sneaks me has got crosses on it.  So there you go.  Now, you were with them for a while.  What years were that?  60, 62.  60 to 62.  Two years.  Three years.  And, you know, you're playing around in the clubs around Liverpool.  Yeah.  And carrying your own equipment probably, right, back then?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's true.  Can you imagine the Beatles carrying their own equipment?  Yeah.  Well, you know, a band.  Right.  So do you have any hand in penning any of the songs that were so popular? 
[01:57:00]  Not actually penning them, but arranging some of them, Look Me Do and Pierce, I Love You.  Really?  Yeah.  And you get squapped from that?  Yeah, but I made a few Bubba Fiantholes, didn't I?  Oh, you did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you finally got some money.  Keep that quiet, yeah, you know.  Yeah, well, how were you involved in the anthology?  I wasn't really.  They just basically phoned me up and sent around and said, you know, we want to use some of  your stuff on the anthology.  Oh, there you go.  Now you're able to say, all right, maybe that's Paul's guilt.  Here's some payday for me, at least. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, finally.  It was a long payday.  It was a long payday.  It was 30 years, you know.  Now, what was it like hanging out?  Now, it's the Beatles.  You guys are together.  You're the Beatles.  What was going on behind the scenes?  I'm hearing, it might have been a little drugs, some ladies, some taking liberties with  a few of the lady fans.  What was going on?  What was the vibe?  Lots of drugs, lots of ladies, lots of booze.  Yeah.  Cocktails.  Shake it all together.  Mix it up.  Whatever permutation comes out, you take it.  What were the tastes of the separate guys? 
[01:58:00]  Were any of them into the young chicks?  Some of them liked the tall girls, short, Lady Di and Marion.  What type of girls was...  They all looked like Kimmy.  Oh, please.  You guys would have never made it.  Girls like Kimmy back then.  No way.  It was all shapes and sizes.  All shapes and sizes.  So you get done with the gig.  So let's say you're playing.  What were one of the clubs back then?  The Cavern?  No, more of it happened in Hamburg.  Yeah, that was the play.  Oh, Chairman Girls.  Oh, the Chairman Prowler.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:58:30]  So you get done with the gig, and then what?  You'd be looking out at the crowd and say,  Yeah, I'll take that one.  I like that.  I like that.  It wasn't so much looking out.  It was the case that they picked you.  Oh, so they would come up and say,  Hey, they're going to be the Beatles.  Let me get a piece of this, actually.  Were you last in line for that, too?  Getting the broad?  Oh.  That's debatable.  I mean, okay.  That's debatable.  I'm sure he had his share.  Hey, a big fan of yours is on the line here.  Stalker Patty.  Hi, how are you?  Oh, my God. 
[01:59:00]  It's the trilogy of terror.  Oh, stop it.  We've got Lady Di Marion, and now this is Stalker Patty.  Oh, stop.  I'm nice.  Hi.  Hello.  Oh, I wanted to say hello to Pete Best.  I've been a Beatles fan since I was a small child.  Well, that's not going to make him happy.  Have you heard any of Pete's stuff?  Yeah, you have the original My Body by the Beatles with him in the backup band behind him.  They were a backup band for, like, Tony Sheridan, I think his name was. 
[01:59:30]  Look at this.  I have a...  I think...  I don't know.  I have the...  It's in storage.  It's called My Body.  Pete, she's calling from your house.  She's calling from the bedroom of your house.  Run.  Oh, no.  Oh, stop it.  No, I'm not that bad.  Don't listen to them, please.  Let's all do Pete a favor and call up and say how much you hate the Beatles.  No, that's not...  No, yeah, your whole life...  Well, you see where you are.  Yeah, it's almost my whole life.  No, no, I'm not talking to you.  Pete, Pete, your whole life you're hearing that. 
[02:00:00]  How do you feel about that when people say, hey, I'm a huge Beatles fan?  Do you just say, eh?  And, you know, maybe...  So am I.  So am I.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And maybe you feel different now.  What was it like back then when people would approach you and go, hey, you know, I'm a huge  Beatles fan?  And you go, just, oh, F-Wolf Wanker or something, you know?  In that British sound.  Uh, something like that, yes.  Yeah, F-Wolf Wanker?  Yeah, yeah, something like that.  Quite frankly, I'm surprised you didn't take your own life.  Well, you know something?  You know, F-Wolf Wanker and all the other bits and pieces, it goes that way, you know? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah?  I want to ask him a question.  Oh, thank you.  Kimmy from Survivor.  I want to know, like when John Lennon got shot, were you kind of like, ha-ha?  Whoa, Kimmy!  Oh, my God!  Kimmy, Kimmy, that's sick.  Kimmy comes out with the worst goddamn question ever.  Oh, come on!  Pete, once again, I want to apologize because we don't even know this girl, and she comes  out with some kind of a wacky, off-the-wall, let's think you can't even take it.  You know, we just found a brand new member of the show, though.  Didn't she get hotter asking that question? 
[02:01:00]  No boundaries with this chick.  None.  Oh, my God.  Pete, please, again, let me apologize for that question.  My God.  Now, Yoko would have been hit.  That would have been a treat.  Did you have any communication with the guys after you were 62?  Yeah, I saw them a couple of times.  Yeah?  And what was it like?  Not much said.  No?  What was the reason that was given to you that they said, Patty, we're letting you go? 
[02:01:30]  Oh, okay, I just called the same.  I love you.  All right.  Love, love.  What was the reason that was given?  I wasn't a good enough drum.  Not a good enough drum.  And then they got rain gone.  Well, you have to study baseball questions, isn't it?  Wow.  Because now...  But I never held up water, so then it leads to a whole lot of other things.  What was it?  Did you see anything coming?  Did you see...  No, no.  You didn't see this coming?  No, that was the funny thing.  After two years, known him for three, you didn't know anything which was going to happen. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah?  You came completely out of the blue.  You weren't an a-hole or anything, were you?  Because I know there's some band you get a member of, and you're like,  this guy's a jerk, but we've got to get rid of him.  No, no, no.  No?  So you were like, cool guy, having fun, got along with everybody,  and they just gave you the boot.  The big boot.  I know what that feels like.  Oh, another funny joke there?  No?  I know what it feels like to face every check.  You got a challenger exploding joke or something you're going to just throw in, Kimmy?  No, I'll just sit here. 
[02:02:30]  No, don't be quiet.  I'm waiting for your next question.  Take up another question for Pete.  Okay.  He's best staring her down now.  He is much cuter, though, than Ringo.  Oh, look at that.  Wow, look at that.  I definitely do give you that.  Yeah, look at that.  Hey, do you have any fist fights or anything with these guys?  I mean, nothing like that?  We have fist fights with other guys, but not with them.  Did you?  You guys are like, yeah, you see the old pictures.  You've got the leather jackets on your old tough guys.  We're from Liverpool.  Liverpool.  That was the working class, downtrodden, tough guy things. 
[02:03:00]  Any stories of any barroom brawls with John?  I'm sure Paul just ran away like a little faggot.  Mostly John and myself.  John.  Yeah, John looked like the bad, good, tough guy.  Paul runs away.  Don't hurt me face.  Don't hurt me face.  You know, Mr. Heartthrob guy had to run away.  And Ringo, you know, who really cares about Ringo.  Even the people didn't want to beat him up.  No one even wanted to beat him up.  Except he best. 
[02:03:30]  How did you know that?  That must have been awkward, though.  Did you bump into Ringo after you left the band or just the guy you were in?  I'd known him beforehand and same time we played with him.  You knew him beforehand?  Yeah.  Stabbed you in the back, did he?  Some people do, so.  That's what I'm picking up that, you know, drummer.  Yeah, sounds good.  I like the way you sounded the Beatles.  Yeah, but put it this way.  If you were offered the best job in town, what would you do?  I'd take it.  There you go, Wyatt. 
[02:04:00]  Yes.  So what are you doing now, Pete?  I rest my case.  What are you doing?  I've got my own band.  We just finished touring.  Right.  For a little while.  And we're over here for the Expo.  The Lander Expo International Collectibles,  which is taking place at the Meadowlands Expo Center.  Saturday and Sunday.  Saturday and Sunday.  You could meet Pete Bass, right?  Along with a lot of other people, yeah.  I guess Batman and Robin will be there, Anthony.  Hey, we were supposed to talk with, what's his name there?  Burt Ward.  Burt Ward.  Tracy Lords will be there.  David Carradine. 
[02:04:30]  And, of course, Pete Bass.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  And Soupy Sims.  Soupy Sims?  Wow.  Now I've got to go.  He's got to throw a pie in his face.  He loves that.  Kimmy, you didn't want to say something like,  I thought he was dead.  You got another question?  Come on.  Come on, Kimmy.  Hit us with another one.  I love this one.  Hit us with another one.  I can stare at you then.  Come on.  I know.  No one else could get away with that question.  Yeah.  Come on.  If we said that, Pete Bass would have walked out.  That is something that you automatically think of. 
[02:05:00]  I mean, come on now.  You're sitting there, and maybe you didn't want him to die,  but if he got shot in the arm or something, you know.  What if Ringo got shot in the arm?  He would have been very happy.  He'd have probably played better.  They would have been calling Pete out.  You said that.  Yes, I said that.  You said that.  Pete's forever the diplomat, aren't you?  No.  You know, when we were outside, he paid me to ask that question.  He did, did he?  He did.  I did.  Liar, liar. 
[02:05:30]  My nose is growing up.  Yes.  No one will ever beat that question on our show.  I know.  How do you beat that?  Don't deal.  Asking Pete that question.  Yeah.  So the Meadowlands, what is it, the Expo Center?  Expo Center, yes.  That they have.  Yes, Saturday and Sunday.  Pete Bass.  And you're going to be playing?  No.  No?  You're just going to be hanging?  Just hanging.  Yeah.  Not by my neck, but not yet anyway, you know.  Do you play out anymore?  You do live shows?  Sure, yeah.  I've got the band.  Yeah?  We just finished, actually, three weeks or so in the States. 
[02:06:00]  Do you do any Beatles covers?  Yes, we do.  You do?  Really?  Yes, we do.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you might as well.  Along with about a million other bands as well, yeah.  Yeah.  So you do, yeah.  Well, everyone's covered Beatles, don't you?  Why not you?  You were there with the original guy.  Yes, yeah.  That's it.  Yeah, we do our own stuff.  Yeah, do whatever it takes.  We've got a question for...  That makes money, though.  ...for people.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, Steve?  Hey.  I was wondering, you know, you've seen the movies, Noel, what, how Stu Sutcliffe died.  What really happened to him? 
[02:06:30]  Basically, what you saw in the movie, that he died of a brain hemorrhage, but it wasn't  to the fight that took place in Liverpool.  That was the way the movie portrayed it.  Uh-huh.  Stuart has been suffering from a lot of headaches, but we don't know where they actually came  from, but in June 61, he did die of a brain hemorrhage, very tragically.  Well, it wasn't because of a fight?  No, no.  I think the movies turned around, a lot of the media turned around and said that, but  it never, that fight never took place to the dimension that did.  There was a fight that John and myself got him out of, but he didn't take a bad beating 
[02:07:00]  like the film portrait.  You bruises.  We help friends.  Any Stu Sutcliffe hemorrhage comments, Kimmy?  Kimmy?  I'll pass.  Comment?  Can it pass an hour?  You know what?  To be quite honest, I have no idea who he is.  No disrespect.  Don't know who he is.  He was in the Beatles, too.  Don't know who he is.  A little before my time.  All right, Johnny, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey, Pete, I'm a big Everton fan.  Good.  How you doing?  You Liverpool or Everton? 
[02:07:30]  Everton, most probably, yeah.  All right, good as some part.  I wanted to ask two questions.  I love you.  Number one, did you ever kick Ringo's ass?  Before, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, you're dead.  You got a fight.  Wow.  Cool.  And the second one, when you go to the Meadowlands, is that Sullivan going to introduce you?  I don't think so.  Okay, terrific.  Good luck, man.  All right, Jim.  Bye.  Let's go to Finger Bang.  Finger Bang.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I heard a rumor that the reason Pete was kicked out of the band was that he was getting more women 
[02:08:00]  than John and Paul.  So they kicked him out and they got Ringo because Ringo's ugly.  Ah.  Were you a little too good looking for the Beatles?  Well, that's a theory.  Another theory.  You like that theory, right, Pete?  Yeah, that's a theory.  Pete likes to stick to.  I won't argue about that.  I can vouch.  She's a nice looking guy.  Keep going, Kimmy.  Keep going.  Hey, we can get Marion to give you a little something.  Oh, Jesus.  I like people.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good. 
[02:08:30]  You love it.  That's good.  You love it.  Stop for a fucking time.  All right.  Thank you, Finger Bang.  Take care, guys.  Have a good day.  What is this?  All right.  The Beatles featuring Tony Sharon.  Hamburg, 61.  Who's that?  Hey.  Hold on a sec.  Hold on.  Tony, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  If they kicked out Ringo, him, and got Ringo, how crappy a drummer is he? 
[02:09:00]  How crappy a drummer are you, Pete?  I'm a better crappy drummer.  I think a monkey could smack with his feet and play better than Ringo.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  We're not making Pete Best too happy right now.  Matt, you got a question for Pete?  Matt Devote?  I just wanted to back up what the guy said before.  That was the big rumor, Pete.  Pete, don't be too, you know, modest.  The guys were kind of jealous.  Rumor had it.  Pete was getting all the ladies in Hamburg. 
[02:09:30]  Ah.  And in Liverpool.  Well, yeah.  I mean, if that's the case, but it's not a reason for getting kicked out, though.  Back then, I guess, you know.  Everyone got the wrong chair.  Every 18-year-old guy went full.  Blitzkrieging your way through the German women.  Nice.  Nice.  What fun memories.  Kimmy, any final questions?  Final questions?  Um, no.  Did you hear Kimmy's question, Matt?  She's done that.  That's the million-dollar question.  You know, I just can't top it, though. 
[02:10:00]  Nice, Kimmy.  You know, I just leave now because I have nothing better to say.  And she's smiling and laughing as she says it, which was even better.  I want you to put down your writing to me.  She's made it down.  I'm not going to present that.  Yeah, we got a topless picture of Kimmy, Pete.  We'll, uh...  On that.  Write it on that.  Okay.  See it.  We'll print it out.  On the back of me.  On the back of me.  We'll show you that in a little bit.  Well, we were told to get you out of here at 5.30.  Is that true?  You're late.  Yeah.  Places to go.  All right, Pete.  Pete, thank you very much for coming in.  Thank you, guys.  Pleasure to meet you. 
[02:10:30]  And ask you a couple of those questions that have been plaguing us and Kimmy for quite some time now.  Pete Best.  All right, he's going to be at the Meadowlands Expo Center this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, 201-233-1000.  That's in Secaucus, New Jersey, okay?  Yeah.  Pete Best.  What kind of show is this?  It's like somebody pouring hot wax in your ears until your brain is completely numb.  The Alty and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. 
[02:11:00]  It is the O&A Show.  Kimmy from Survivor in the studio.  A Long Island girl who was a huge fan of our show before she went into the Outback, Anthony.  Yes.  We're going to talk to her in a little bit, but Dice wants to say hi.  What?  Dice.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Talking to you.  You got a chick there from Survivor?  Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Kimmy, how are you doing?  How are you doing?  She's smoking in person, Dice.  How was it doing that thing?  There's a little rush. 
[02:11:30]  It was a little rough.  A little rough.  But I like it rough like that, so it was okay.  You like it rough.  Good for you.  Good for you, then, right?  Good for you, Cinderella.  You know what I mean?  Ask it a question.  Oh, no.  All right.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Don't get stupid on me now.  Which way?  Medium rare.  Yeah, right.  Wow.  You are a fan of this show.  Yeah, man. 
[02:12:00]  I got another one for us.  No one.  No one gets the answer for this one.  Which way?  I don't know.  I'll ask you now.  Plastic or paper?  Oh, no.  Oh, this is so unfair.  Come on, Kimmy.  You're on Survivor.  Survive the question.  Or natural?  What?  Hey.  Which way?  Plastic or paper?  Stop!  What do you mean, stop?  Just answer.  It's easy. 
[02:12:30]  I use a canvas bag.  Oh, no.  Don't be stupid.  Come on.  You were in the woods for three months.  Which way?  Plastic or paper?  Paper or plastic what?  What do you mean, paper or plastic what?  Paper or plastic what?  I was over there.  No, that's not the question.  I asked the question.  I was over there.  No, I'm over here now.  I know you're over there now because I'm over here now.  No, you're over there because you're you.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  If I was me, which I am, because you're you and I'm not, because if I was, then everybody 
[02:13:00]  would be like, go ahead.  Nah, nah.  You know what I mean?  Of course.  All right.  What do you like better?  I love it, God.  A face full of pallet pasta or a face full of oysters?  All right.  Are you writing a book, Dice?  No.  I'm trying to help you guys out.  Remember we were going through the whole thing?  Oh, yeah.  Now, listen.  Dice, you got to hear what Kimmy did today, though.  All right.  What happened?  We had Pete Best in the studio.  You know who Pete Best is?  Yeah, that guy.  The guy that should have been the Beatles and wasn't, and then they picked Ringo over 
[02:13:30]  him and stuff, kicked him out of the bank.  How awful was that to go through your life going, I could have been.  Right.  I was the guy, but I had too bad of an attitude.  So we're doing the interview, right?  I can't believe you had him on.  Yeah, we're doing the interview, and you know, quite frankly, it was kind of whatever, an  average interview.  And out of nowhere, Kimmy asked Pete Best this.  Kimmy?  I asked him if he was kind of happy when John Lennon got shot.  Oh, that's nice.  That's nice, huh? 
[02:14:00]  How insane is that, Dice?  Well, that is crazy.  I mean, the guy had to get over it by now.  No, he's not.  He's not over it?  No, he's not over the fact that he got kicked out of the Beatles.  Did you do, like, drum lessons for $3 an hour?  For the scanner.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Could you imagine you could have become, like, you know, part of history, been in the greatest  rock group ever, and because you didn't know the answer to paper or plastic, you wind  up not in a band?  How does that happen? 
[02:14:30]  I don't know how it happens.  What did he say?  You're the ones that interviewed him.  I told him I'm surprised he's still alive.  I would have taken my own life by now.  Yeah, that's got to be heavy to handle.  It's got to be.  Yeah.  But what did he say?  I know what you're saying, but what did he say?  Nothing.  He was kind of shy and laid back.  Well, how do you be shy when you're on the radio?  All people know is what you're saying.  That's why Kimmy...  Like, if we all stop talking now, there is no radio.  That's why Kimmy came out with that question. 
[02:15:00]  And that's why that jerk-off didn't get in the group.  Right.  You know what I mean?  What, was he shy about hitting the drums?  I don't want to hit him too loud.  I'm a little shy in front of people.  Get out of here, jerk-off face.  Hey, Dice?  Yeah.  What do you think of Robin from the Batman and Robin show?  Remember the old TV show?  Yeah, but at least he got on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, I know how it goes.  That's what I say when I'm in bed with a chick.  What do you think of...  You know what I mean?  When I'm pugging on a book drapes a little.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:30]  What do you think of Robin?  What do you mean, what do I think of him?  I don't think of him unless I see him.  Was he good?  Was he good?  At what?  At the Batman and Robin thing.  The show.  Well, he was like the faggotito part of that group.  What do you mean?  The faggotito part.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Like Batman was all machoed out.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He had like the look.  He got the chicks.  You know, Robin was...  Are we talking about the show or the movies?  The TV show. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, the show.  He was like all fire faggotitoed out.  He never got the broads.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So he'd have his head up the penguin's ass half the time.  So you're saying he's probably a faggot.  I'm just saying that was like the part.  That he played on TV?  Yeah, I mean, look at the colors.  Batman was like in all like, you know, all of them like good colors.  Like black.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Heavy duty blues.  Right. 
[02:16:30]  And what was that?  They put Robin like in the pink with the yellow cape.  Fag!  Yeah, whatever they put him in.  So you didn't like the Robin, huh?  I didn't say I didn't like him.  I thought he was a nice guy.  What, you ever meet him?  No.  Would you want to meet him?  Not really.  Why not?  Because who even thinks about him?  The game is over.  There are a lot of fans.  He's probably like 83 years old by now, the real Robin.  I don't think he's that old.  Well, is he there? 
[02:17:00]  Don't play games with me.  No.  You got Robin in there with his head?  We got Kimmy here.  We don't have Robin.  I know you got Kimmy there.  Right.  Yeah, Kimmy's here.  But Kimmy's still trying to figure out pay for credit.  See, we were having a discussion about Batman and Robin.  We were curious of your thoughts.  That's all.  Yeah, everybody was checking in with how they felt about Batman and Robin.  I think Robin used to maybe, you know, play with the chubby Cyclops a little.  You think so?  Yeah.  I think Batman was sort of a turn-on, because why didn't this kid go get his own apartment? 
[02:17:30]  You know what I mean?  That makes sense.  So you know he's creeping around with Batman.  Oh, Batman, you're the best.  Oh, look at you now.  So you're thinking Robin wanted Batman.  I think he had a little thing for Batman.  You know what I mean?  He enjoyed that pole a little too much when they were going down.  Yeah.  A little chubby Cyclops work on the side.  Bat pole.  Bat pole.  All right.  Bert.  Why are you even talking about him?  I don't know.  He's there, isn't he?  Uh, Burt Ward.  Yes.  How you doing, Burt?  Remember Burt Ward? 
[02:18:00]  He was Robin in the old Batman TV series.  He's the best.  I mean, who's better than Robin?  You know, it always seemed like Batman was the guy that was solving the crime.  Right.  But Robin was the one with the brains.  Absolutely.  You know, Batman would fly off the handle all the time, you know, and try to put Robin,  like, in the back.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, you're nobody.  I'm everybody.  Yeah.  I'm the tough guy, and you're nobody.  Right.  But then Robin would always come in to save the day.  Like, when he put his hand in the sand and pulled Batman out of the quicksand that time. 
[02:18:30]  Remember that, Burt?  Of course.  Burt.  Yes.  You were always my favorite.  See, they're not fooling nobody.  I knew you were on the line.  Well, you did.  That's why you said all that really nice stuff for the last ten minutes.  That's why I was trying to egg you on to get you to say something.  You know what I mean?  Oh, I see.  Now, Burt.  If you were Batman, you would have all of a sudden, you would have went like, wait a minute  now.  I'm no faggot, D-O.  Now, now, Burt Ward, do you...  Speak up for yourself.  You can't be like this, you know, this other guy, the Beatle man. 
[02:19:00]  Pete Best.  Burt Ward, do you know Andrew Dice Clay?  Dice, shut up a minute.  Burt Ward, do you know Andrew Dice Clay?  No, I haven't met him.  But do you know who he is?  I know, of course I know who he is.  Oh, okay.  That's who you're speaking to.  That's who's on the phone.  Well, it's a pleasure.  Yeah.  So, let me ask you something.  When they did all the Batman movies, were you a little pissed off they didn't throw you  in there?  Well, you know, it's always disappointing when you work very hard to build a character 
[02:19:30]  and then they go a different direction.  But, you know, look, they're in it for the money, so, you know, it's a different kind  of thing.  They didn't want to have family entertainment.  They wanted, you know, more of a hard-edged show.  Right.  And we represented comedy and family entertainment, you know, and as a result, they didn't want  Adam or I.  You know what?  There were a bunch of humps, and you know it, and I know it.  Meanwhile, guys...  I'm going to put you in there.  Even when they made Shaft with, remade Shaft with, uh... 
[02:20:00]  Samuel Jackson.  Samuel.  Yeah, with Samuel Jackson.  They threw the other guy in there.  Yeah.  They threw the other guy in there.  It's wonderful to see him, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  See, that's what I love about black people.  They stick together.  They take care of their own.  But these humps in Hollywood, they remake Batman.  That could have been parts for you when, uh, the other Batman...  Dice.  What?  What would have, uh, Burt Ward played in, uh, the Batman movies?  Well, he could have played, like, uh, Robin's father or something. 
[02:20:30]  Robin's father?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, he could have been another generation.  Another generation.  Hey, Dice, these two, uh, uh, uh, Batman and Robin and Burt Ward...  And, uh...  Look at the movies, Batman.  They were banging...  Remember when you were fighting a shark?  Yeah.  When you were coming out of the helicopter?  Yeah, I remember that hanging from that ladder and using the, uh...  That was awesome.  I have watched that at least 1,500 times.  Dice, they were banging everything in Hollywood back then, these two. 
[02:21:00]  Were you really?  We, uh, we always treated our fans well.  They went to the conventions and stuff, and they'd make these appearances and bang everything.  You know what I mean?  Girls sliding down the bat poles left and right.  It was amazing.  That's right.  Hopping up and down on that, uh, uh, that Robin pipe.  That's right, Dice.  You know what I mean?  Hey, Bert, do you like Dice?  Uh, you sound like a really interesting guy, Dice.  No.  That means no, Dice.  Oh, excuse me. 
[02:21:30]  I didn't know you were a tough guy now.  Maybe I'd throw my cape on.  All of a sudden, I'm interesting.  I am not interesting.  I'm a moron.  He, he meant everything he said, Bert.  Yeah.  You know what I mean, Bert?  Yeah, I got the message.  I got no problem with you.  I'm not, you know, I'm not looking for a fight.  You said that.  I think Bert could kick your ass, Dice.  I think so.  You know what?  He knows all them tricks.  I used to see him fight.  Right.  Got a utility belt.  He's got the belt.  They got the words.  Every time they hit, it would say, like, pow. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  It would say, you know, hair pie.  It would say potato juice.  How do you compete with that, Dice?  You know, he hits the guy in the face, hair pie putty.  You know, it would say on the screen.  My buddy.  You know what I mean?  Absolutely.  He's got that.  Oh, I punched her right in the pink lettuce.  The pink lettuce.  But the truth, like, you know, you probably had a lot of girl fans back then.  Hey, Bert?  Yeah?  You never punched a girl in the pink lettuce, did you?  I don't mean punched her. 
[02:22:30]  You punch her with the meat rocket.  You know what I'm talking about.  You know what I mean?  You get on the...  Yeah, yeah.  Those are obstacles that are added after we do the fight scene.  Right.  The meat rocket.  The meat rocket.  Yeah, like, you'd meet, like, girls.  Like, you would probably go to signings and stuff.  Like, in the mall in Brooklyn or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  And, you know, you give, like, you meet, like, a hot little chick.  You give her a nice shellacking after.  Shellacking.  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.  I'm using radio stuff.  Yeah, I like that.  Well, you guys, Bert, you guys used to go to those conventions or whatever it is, the appearances that Batman... 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, I was on the road 25 years.  And what used to happen there?  Because I hear tell stories of sex going on with the fans while you guys were in costume.  Well, I have a book called Boy Wonder, My Life in Tights, which is detailed things rather specifically.  Yeah.  And it's certainly a book for adults.  It's certainly not for kids.  But we had a good time.  You've got to understand, it was a different period in our history.  It was the 60s and into the 70s and, you know, into the 80s. 
[02:23:30]  And it was a different world.  I mean, you don't have the same freedom today, you know, unless you take some serious chances.  Yeah.  You throw a bag on it and you give them a trash in the back of the car or something.  A trash, you know?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, well, we had a lot of fun and, you know, there was some mystique about superheroes and their costumes.  Girls love to wear our costumes.  Hey, Bert, what do you think of the ambiguously gay duo that SNL does? 
[02:24:00]  What do you mean?  You ever see that, the cartoon?  No.  No, I haven't seen that.  Because I think it might be based on you guys.  Loosely based on Batman and Robin.  I would have to see it.  Well, you know, when we did our series, everybody wanted to put their two cents in, okay?  So there were some religious organizations that thought that Batman and Robin represented the wish dream of two homosexuals.  But I'll tell you something.  The reality is Adam and I were like two hungry sharks in a world of unlimited halibut.  Ah. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, look at that.  And we were very busy with ladies and didn't have the slightest bit of interest in the same sex.  Hey, Bert, could you give us a Robin line so we could make sure it's you?  Wait a minute.  Holy ravioli!  Available at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Holy ravioli.  Did you ever, like, actually, you know, give any of these chicks a shellac and more your warty outfit?  Yeah.  Well, are you saying that we have a lot of fun? 
[02:25:00]  Even while we were wearing...  Yeah, of course we did.  No, I'm not talking like, you know, like when you get them up to the hotel room where nobody's looking.  I understand.  I'm talking like...  I understand you better than you think.  I know you do.  Oh, that sounds like fighting words.  But let's just say that we had a very wild time on Batman and, you know, it was a period in history where we took every opportunity and we had a lot offered.  Any specifics there?  I don't want to hear some dirt.  Yeah, like, you know, did you ever pull a train with any of these little bat pigs that were hanging around the trailer? 
[02:25:30]  Well, let me just say, if you read my book, your eyes will open up.  Don't worry.  What's the name of the book?  Boy Wonder, My Life and Type.  Truly a book you can judge by its cover.  It's not about me being at Westbury and you showing up in the outfit.  We do, like, a thing on stage together.  He's always offering someone to open up.  Hey, Bert, you have a question for Dice?  No, you don't think that would be a good idea, Dice?  What, all of a sudden?  I'm on stage at Westbury, right? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, here comes, like, oh, look at this.  It's the boy Wonder.  Look what happened.  And, like, you get to hear him, like, talk filthy for the first time.  I don't think I'd do that because we have too much respect for the characters.  I'm telling you, I've got a certain charisma about you.  No, you know, I've got to be honest with you.  In all the years of doing Batman and the subsequent appearances, never once, when we wore the costume,  did we ever break character in terms of people that we met at appearances.  You know, we never, like, took off our mask. 
[02:26:30]  We were always in character when we were in costume.  Right.  You could wear the costume, you know what I mean?  Yeah, what I did with the costume when I wasn't making a public appearance is something else,  but, you know, especially on Halloween.  But, you know, the rest of the time, when we're out in the public, we are very straight-laced.  Do you still have a costume?  Actually, yes.  You do?  Yes, I do.  See, what happened was the ones on our show were always being torn off from the fight scenes. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  But what I had is, because I also made personal appearances,  I had a couple of my own mates that I would use for close-ups in the show  and also as a personal appearance costume.  When was the last time you put on a Robin costume?  I think with my wife last week.  This is what I'm talking about.  Now you're talking my language.  You know what I mean?  You throw on the cape.  You've got to all lick it up.  You're married, right?  Happily, too.  Really?  Very happily.  You know, I'll tell you, after... 
[02:27:30]  You're talking by me now with a garbage bag.  You know, you have to go out and you have a wild time,  and then, you know, that's a certain period in your life,  and then you have other times when, you know,  you can be really happily married with the right person.  How long have you been married?  Ten and a half years.  But isn't that amazing what he's saying?  Guys, the guy's talking about there was a time in his life  where he was having a great time.  Yeah.  You know, shellacking all these chicks,  shooting oysters on their answers, you know what I mean?  Right.  And now he's happily married.  Yeah.  He's happily married. 
[02:28:00]  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  In fact, there was a quote from my book where we said...  It's a little on the risque side.  We said thousands of adoring fans were inseminated with bat sperm,  our ultimate autograph.  Whoa.  Nice.  I see none.  Oh, my God.  A face full of chili and send them on their way,  you know what I mean?  Yeah, thanks for meeting Bat Boy.  Hey, you filthy animal.  There's your autograph.  Well, you know, if we have any listeners left, 
[02:28:30]  I'm going to be making an appearance this weekend  over there in Meadowlands Expo Center.  Right.  Probably the one or two listeners left that are still fans after this interview  might want to come over and get autographed.  Hey, Bert.  Bert.  This is why the Batman movies got more vicious.  We live in a vicious time.  I agree with you.  No one is tuning off their radio, Bert.  Right.  Look at the movies that they do with Batman.  He's always trying one or two chicks in the movies now.  Right. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's a problem.  And then they market it for kids.  You know, I don't mind programming for adults.  That's great.  But don't market it for children because, you know,  kids shouldn't be exposed to that kind of stuff.  Oh.  I agree with you.  That first Batman where Danny DeVito played the...  The penguin.  Yeah.  That was the second Batman, and that one was really, really dark.  That's a Tim Burton direction.  That wasn't for kids.  And you know what?  I'm thinking of suing them for that.  Right, Dye.  It made me to the point that it did something to my mind, I think. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, Bert.  Did you find religion or something?  No.  It's not that it has anything to do with religion.  It's just, you know, when you're with a certain audience, so to speak,  you know, you play to that audience.  And when I'm with kids, I mean, like, I'm really good to kids.  I love kids.  You love kids?  And that doesn't mean that when I'm with adults, I can't have fun with adults.  Right.  Wait a minute.  Do you have kids?  Sure.  Right, too.  All right.  So you've got kids?  Yes.  All right.  You know, just when you say you love kids, look what we went through with Michael Jackson.  We don't want to go through that.  Yeah, well, not quite the same. 
[02:30:00]  Sorry.  I know.  Actually, I have a 10-year-old daughter from my current wife,  and then from the previous wife, I have a 35-year-old daughter.  Wow.  They're 25 years apart.  And you see, my theory of fatherhood is that every 25 years, I sire another child.  That's really horrible.  So you went through, like, a whole lineup of wives.  No, not a whole lineup, but a couple, you know.  And, I mean, you know, it's not easy to find the right situation.  Believe me, you know.  Hey, Bert, was your package too big for the costume? 
[02:30:30]  Frank wants to know in long time.  There did seem to be a big bond.  Well, it wasn't too big for the costume because the costume was expandable.  Were you guys packing?  It was certainly bothersome to the Catholic Legion of Decency.  He didn't like the way the boy Wonder bulged in his tights.  Right.  My opening act, Jim Norton is probably listening to this.  He always wanted to know what you and Batman were packing.  Yeah, did you stuff your package with something?  No, well, Adam used to tease me because of all the heat that I was getting  that I was stuffing my undershorts with Turkish towels. 
[02:31:00]  Ah.  But you weren't doing that, right?  Did he say, let me look in it?  No, on the contrary, it was got to be, I almost got fired off the series  because of that problem.  I mean, they had me wearing double dancer belts and, I mean, all this stuff,  penal restraints, testicle punchers.  But I'm telling you, the only thing that ever worked was this quack doctor  they found that gave me these pills.  Shrink you up for a couple hours.  Are you kidding?  You would shrink your package?  About 12.  And then I got thinking about it.  I said, you know something?  This could mess me up for life. 
[02:31:30]  I might never be able to have children.  So I stopped taking the pills and used my capes and covered.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I got to ask you, you were taking pills to shrink it?  Yeah.  They weren't going to let me go back on the air for the second and third season.  Yeah, what pill was that?  Yeah, what pill?  I don't know.  I believe me, but I got scared taking it and thinking,  hey, this may really mess me up for life.  Hey, Bert.  Yeah.  How big?  Yeah, what are you back?  Hey, listen, I'm not into that stuff.  I'm not into talking about that. 
[02:32:00]  Let me tell you something.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Yeah, Bert.  Usually the people that talk about it don't have it,  so I don't want to talk about it.  Well, that's nice.  Bert, if I had a...  For my opening act, you know Jim.  Yeah, Bert, if I had a 10 or 11 inch, I'd tell the whole world.  Yeah.  Well, you shouldn't be a...  You shouldn't be a...  You're welcome to do that,  but I take it in a more conservative approach.  Yeah.  I'm a married man now.  Hey, Bert, changing gears a little bit,  you know, what do you think of all these reality programs on TV these days?  I don't know.  I mean, for adults, I think it's okay,  but for kids, I mean, 
[02:32:30]  and how are you going to keep kids from seeing this stuff?  We got too many problems in our country.  We can't even build a prison fast enough,  and I really feel bad about that.  Kids don't grow up in a safe world anymore.  And it's like Survivor's fault?  You watch The Survivor?  No, because that's relatively new.  That's only, what, a year or two old.  Yeah.  Do you like The Survivor show?  I don't even watch it.  Why not?  I work too hard.  I do...  I'm very busy.  I still do acting.  I also do feature film animation,  you know, where I've got the whole studio,  and I shoot missiles and blow up buildings and create dinosaurs, 
[02:33:00]  and I don't really have a good time doing that.  It'll never give me a job.  You don't hang out at home, though,  after you're done,  kick your feet up and turn on the TV?  Oh, I work out of our home.  Well, then don't you turn on the TV ever?  Hardly ever.  Hardly ever.  Because, you know...  You live out in L.A., right?  Yeah.  Down in the L.A. area.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know where you are.  Sounds like a threat, doesn't it?  No, no.  I know where...  I wouldn't say, because I...  See, this is the thing.  When you live out in L.A.,  people always make sure,  when you look somewhere at homes or, 
[02:33:30]  you know, anything,  to tell you who lives there.  Right.  And, you know, I'm just like...  Well, they do that in Beverly Hills.  They have tours that go through,  and they'll drive by the various stars' homes  and, you know, that's where so-and-so lived  and that's where so-and-so lives now  and all that kind of stuff.  Hey, Dice, is Robin your neighbor?  No, but I know where he lives  because some real estate agent  was dumb enough to point it out one time.  Yeah.  You know, and this was before I even made it  in show business. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Well, I probably moved from there.  Right, okay.  You know, celebrities are entitled to their privacy.  Yeah.  Now, I'm a legend.  Right.  Yeah, that's a big difference.  Right.  That's right, Dice.  You're a legend.  In his own right, he's a legend.  I mean, he created something incredibly.  Of course, everybody knows.  How come they never got, like, Batman and Robin  together with the Green Hornet and Jacob?  Hey, we did.  We did.  We had the same executive producer  and that's how the Green Hornet show came on.  See, how do you know, Dice?  In fact, a piece of trivia for you. 
[02:34:30]  Bruce Lee's first filmed fight scene of his career.  First time ever filmed with Fighting Me.  Stop.  You know what?  That's why I remember it.  Did he kick his ass?  Well, Bruce and I were personal friends.  At the time I was shooting Batman,  we lived in the same condominium complex  and we used to spar three times a week.  We were personal friends.  He was incredible.  We'd go out together for dinner and stuff.  We were very good friends.  So the thing we did on Batman, though,  it was very staged  because both of us were supposedly good guys 
[02:35:00]  and he couldn't look like one of the good guys  was getting an upper hand of the other.  Right.  Yeah, I remember that  because I saw, like, a thing on that.  Yeah, a thing.  So were you appearing?  Were you going to do an appearance in New York?  Yeah, I'm actually over in New Jersey,  Secaucus at the Meadowlands Expo Center.  Adam West and myself, Batman and Robin  will be there Saturday and Sunday.  In costume, Bert, in costume?  No, we're going to probably have our costumes hanging up.  Hanging up now.  Because, you know, the problem is  when you wear costumes 
[02:35:30]  and somebody asks you a question  other than, you know,  Batman or Robin question,  we can't answer it very well.  How long are you going to be in New York for?  Two days.  Two days?  Yeah, coming under the cover of night  and fighting heinous villains  and returning to L.A.  Not until the 13th.  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.  Just...  No, Westbury's not until the 13th.  Right, but we're not going there.  We're going Saturday and Sunday.  I didn't know you had to come with you.  I could use the two of you guys.  Like, you like...  Like, we do, like, a fight thing.  Yeah.  Start the show.  Yeah.  And, you know, like, 
[02:36:00]  everybody starts laughing.  Right.  Yeah, that's a great idea.  You know what I mean?  I'm good like that.  I'll send you my stunt double.  Hey, hold on a second, Dyson.  I do my own stunts.  What do you mean, hold on?  No, we have this girl  that wants to ask Burt Ward a question.  Marion.  Okay.  Hold on.  Oh, Marion is a huge fan.  Huge fan of Robin.  Of Robin.  So I've got to keep quiet at this point.  She doesn't like you, Dyson.  What do you mean she don't like me?  She don't know me to like you.  She don't like you.  Marion, make it fast.  Hi, Burt.  How you doing?  Fine, thank you.  How you been? 
[02:36:30]  What have you been doing?  I've been great, thank you.  Really terrific.  I am a big fan of you.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Before...  Burt.  Okay.  Burt, just to give you a little background.  I talk too much.  She's just a little retarded.  So just hear with her.  Don't have something wrong with her.  I'm not listening to Opie.  I ain't retarded.  Brain damage.  Hey, even retarded people can ask questions.  I mean, everybody gets a chance.  I ain't retarded.  I make a bang also.  Remember that, Robin?  Hi, Andy.  How you doing?  Hey, what are you doing over there? 
[02:37:00]  How you been?  Andy.  No, I'm good.  I'm over here.  Go ahead.  Ask Robin the question.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Oh, no.  Do you still keep in touch with Adam West?  If what now?  Do you still keep in touch with Adam West?  Adam lives in Idaho, and I live in Southern California.  So although we occasionally see each other, in fact, actually, our Batman movie we did is  now being released on DVD.  And about two weeks ago, he and I went into 20th Century Fox and recorded some of that,  what they call bonus material with interviews. 
[02:37:30]  And we did a commentary all the way through the movie that, when the movie comes out on  DVD, if you want to listen to it, you can actually hear us commenting about what happened  with that scene and all this kind of crazy stuff.  Ah.  Okay.  We're good friends, and he'll be here this weekend, you know.  And he's a wild and crazy guy.  Dice, you'd like Adam.  I mean, you guys would be a good reason for him.  Uh, thank you, Mary.  Now, why don't we escort the retarded one out of the studio?  I'm not retarded, old man.  They're like the retarded Batman and Robin.  He's not retarded.  Is that the girl that Norton was, um... 
[02:38:00]  No.  No, that's just another retarded.  Oh, there's another one.  Yeah.  Um, Bert, we want to thank you, man.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah.  Uh, you guys...  Hey, Bert.  Yeah.  Bert, remember, the 13th and 14th, I'll throw you guys a few bucks.  We'll have a couple laughs.  I'll have some bat slobs in the bathroom.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  No, believe me, I fully understand you.  Yeah.  No, I mean, me and you will get together.  We'll have a couple laughs.  Okay.  All right, Bert Ward. 
[02:38:30]  Pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  Appearing with Adam West at the Meadowlands Expo Center in Secaucus, New Jersey, Saturday  and Sunday.  Batman and Robin together this weekend.  International Point of the Megashow.  To the Batmobile citizens.  I wish I was there to go to that thing.  To the Batmobile citizens.  Guys, we've got to take a break.  All right, so take a...  I'm going to go.  All right.  Okay.  April, we're going to hang out here and wait for you to take a break.  We've got to talk to Kimmy from Survivor.  No, I understand.  And we've got someone that wants to get naked for us. 
[02:39:00]  All right, that's always good.  All right.  Guys, April 13th and 14th, Westbury Music Fair, we're going.  All right, don't worry about it.  I'll be over there soon.  All right.  Medium or well done.  Medium or well done.  What?  Medium or well done.  No, I ask.  You ask what?  No, I ask.  What?  What happened?  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium.  Nah.  Yeah?  Medium or well done.  Medium rare.  You're not anything. 
[02:39:30]  Of course.  All right, I'll talk to you guys later, all right?  Dice.  What?  Where's your manners?  What do you mean?  You didn't say goodbye to Kimmy.  I thought you wanted to hang up.  You didn't say goodbye to Kimmy.  You didn't say goodbye to Kimmy, though.  What are you going to cause a problem?  She was a nice girl.  You caused a problem.  I didn't cause no problem.  I didn't say one off-court thing to her.  Thank you.  I said the thing about pork ribs.  Big deal.  She knows.  You know, she was on that island for months.  What do you think she was doing there?  You asked her a question.  Kimmy, the truth.  Behind the scenes. 
[02:40:00]  Yes.  You know, there's a lot of shellacking going on, right?  You know what?  There wasn't much shellacking going on.  There's a rumor in one of the drag magazines that they got a video of, I think, Colby and  Jerry going at it.  Yeah, you know what?  I want to see that, though, because...  No, that's nonsense.  That's the prep.  Honestly, you were so dirty out there.  No hygiene, no nothing.  You don't even want to.  Oh, the more it smells, the more I want in.  It's easy to find.  You go, now, that's the smell of them pink lettuce that I like. 
[02:40:30]  You know what I mean?  Of course, Dice.  Isn't that a nice name for it?  Remember you told me you needed more names?  Right.  Yeah.  Pink lettuce.  So I give you pink lettuce and you give me yam bag back.  No, we want yam bag and we're taking pink lettuce.  And, Dice, I'll have you know that when you guys were discussing smuggling plums, I knew  all about that when you were educating ONA on it.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, really?  That's about a month or two back.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind tickling your little Japanese snapping tail down there. 
[02:41:00]  Hey, there's a rumor that Kimmy has a hardwood floor, Dice.  What do you mean?  What does that mean?  Oh, her hairstyle down there.  It's time to talk.  Really?  Hardwood floor, or we call it also the JonBenet Ramsey.  I like that, the hardwood floor.  That's very funny.  Hey, are we playing that today?  It's better to show up than a hardwood floor.  Kimmy, would you play that today if we gave you your own phone somewhere else?  Oh, I don't know.  It'll be our first game of Celebrity What's in My Pins.  Oh, my God.  Imagine it.  The first one.  If it's the first one, I might just have to like... 
[02:41:30]  I swear.  So, Kimmy, you didn't bathe the lot there.  No, Dice, I didn't.  I was a dirty girl.  But I'm a dirty girl.  Yeah, I like them dirty.  Yeah, so...  Don't be dirty.  Hey, Dice, how do you take it?  What's that?  How do you take it?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Well, normally I start you on top, right?  Uh-huh.  Then I throw you on your back, and I give you an ounce of hair part, buddy.  Everybody goes home and win it with me.  I'd love to get on that island.  Nobody gets away from me.  Hey, you gave us a lot of good things to steal today. 
[02:42:00]  And you're not...  What are you talking about?  You can't steal it.  You're supposed to give me some back.  Nuh-uh.  Nuh-uh.  What do you mean, no?  Nuh-uh.  I was going to get a steal.  Nuh-uh-uh.  We gave you balloon nod.  That's yours.  Balloon nod?  What's balloon nod?  Nobody's going to laugh at balloon nod.  Balloon nod's good.  Everyone laughs at balloon nod.  Balloon nod's better than pink lettuce.  No, it's not.  Yes.  Eh, it's nice.  It's... no.  But I'm not taking it.  Pink lettuce is mine.  We'll give you the whale's eye.  I'll give you the chubby cyclops. 
[02:42:30]  Okay.  And the pink lettuce for the yam bag.  Nah, yam bag's too good.  Yeah.  But I recorded you a bag.  Everybody knows it's mine.  Nah, they think you stole it from us.  They know I didn't steal it from you.  You have to have a sick, demented mind to come up with yam bag.  And we're keeping...  And we know I have that.  We're keeping banana juice, too.  What do you mean banana juice is recorded?  You can't have that.  We got banana juice.  Can I have banana juice?  Oh.  We'll give you butt butter.  Banana juice?  I'll give you a face full of palate pasta. 
[02:43:00]  You're out of your mind.  Why?  Isn't that a good one?  No.  What do you mean, no?  A lot of people are pissed that you didn't let Kimmy talk.  What are you talking about?  She can say whatever she wants.  She's scared of you.  You're talking.  Why?  She's scared.  Kimmy, say something.  I'm frightened.  I'm frightened.  You're not frightened.  You were on that beach out there with these animals.  Yes, I was.  You know what I mean?  Grabbing you, tying you the trees.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  The natives got restless. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Did you drink a lot on the island?  A lot of water.  No, I mean like, you know, like at night?  No, we didn't have a little gin mill going on out there.  There was none of that.  We're going to steal shooting oysters on your ass.  Did you really eat like, you know, bugs and stuff?  I swallowed a worm.  Did you really?  Yes.  You swallowed a worm.  It was a black 14-inch worm.  Yeah.  And Dice?  It was really a 14-inch worm.  You little filthy animal.  I'd love to meet you.  Dice, you know.  Where do you live, Cinderella? 
[02:44:00]  Long Island.  Long Island.  Yes, we'll be at Westbury Music Fair.  Well, I'm coming out there.  You better be there.  April 13th and 14th.  Oh, well, have you built?  Yeah, she's built.  Really?  We got a picture of her topless on one of our websites.  She's not round-shouldered, is she?  What?  Round-shouldered.  Yeah, round-shouldered.  I don't like round-shouldered girls.  They have a weak bust line.  They're kind of round-shouldered.  They're kind of pointy.  You know when they like hunch?  Oh, the hunch over?  No.  No, she stands tall.  Round-shouldered girls go against me like rat poison.  Kimmy, how tall are you?  I'm just under 5'10".  Yeah, she's like 5'10 and really thin. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, she's got to be in good shape to be on that island.  We found out that she gained weight to do Survivor.  Yeah.  Like 8 to 10 pounds, right?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, what'd you get pregnant?  No, I was eating ice cream every day.  Oh, were you?  Yes, I did.  All of a sudden, they had ice cream on the island.  No, it's not.  All of a sudden, there was a consumer truck driving around for you.  Is that what you've been doing, Dice?  What?  Oh.  I've got to get in shape.  I'll tell you, I came out of the cage for a few weeks like an animal.  Are you getting ready for Survivor 3? 
[02:45:00]  That's why?  No, no, no, no.  I'm getting ready to survive you guys again.  Yeah, that's going to be fun.  All right, we'll let you go.  By the way, Kimmy's not a meat eater.  He's gone.  Did he hang up?  I hang up on you.  Did he hang up on you?  Yeah, I hang up on you.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll talk to Kimmy from Survivor.  And the moment you've been waiting for, Lady Di wants to hug Anthony.  No.  For her birthday.  In the words of...  And Madison from Privilege is here? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I think another girl also showed up.  It ain't gonna happen.  Our ass contest.  What?  Oh, the winner of the ass contest.  Oh, we've got to announce the winner of the best ass contest next as well.  A gigantic boombox is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG 7.  Anthony and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.

[02:47:00]  Who?  Last week, a sledgehammer to the skull by Triple H left 16 staples in the Undertaker's forehead.  You hit someone with a sledgehammer in the head, it's going to take more than 16 staples.  I believe it.  Can I hit Lady Di in the head with a sledgehammer and see if she only needs 16?  Oh, great.  What did they say?  Someone's saying the T-word.  We had to dump out.  Okay.  Of course, the Undertaker looking for revenge.  These two WWF superstars will take brutality to a whole new level at WrestleMania. 
[02:47:30]  And the Dudley Boys, Hardy Boys, Edge and Christian in tables, ladders and chairs, too.  Plus, they have this first-ever gimmick battle royal featuring legends.  Remember WWF legend Sergeant Slaughter, Brother Love, Iron Sheik, Hillbilly Jim, Nikolai Volkov,  and a bunch of the other guys that you remember from the past.  They'll be there.  So, a lot of surprises at WWF WrestleMania 17, live only on Cablevision Pay-Per-View. 
[02:48:00]  This Sunday, 8 p.m., call your local Cablevision Pay-Per-View rep to order now.  9-7-6-20-20.  The official lottery number.  Uh, Anthony, we had to break into commercials because, um, Psycho Mark is here.  Kimmy, that's the famous Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Kimmy loves Psycho.  Kimmy knows everything about our show.  I know.  Isn't it great?  Hey, uh, Mark.  Mark.  Mark is spanking his junk in front of the window and tonguing.  Mark, go horrify the retarded of her and Shirley, all right?  We got a mic out there that they don't know about.  All right, go.  They have no idea where they're on the air.

It doesn't matter how bad it gets.  She'll be like, so what do you do?  I like to pay for it.  She wants you to put five.  So fuck's five when I go and I'm going to pay for it.  Zip this.  Zip this, buddy. 
[02:56:30]  She's laughing at her.  Zip it.  Roll one.  Zip it.  Roll one.  Zip it.  Zip it.  That's a fly.  Zip it.  That's terrible.  But I'm sorry.  I'll come here.  The first.  All right.  We'll be back.  B. Anthony.  We hate each other.  Besides, he's certifiably insane.  Thank you, Adeline.  Shut up, you jackass.  O.B. and Anthony.  Two ignorant jackasses who someone was brain dead enough to give a radio show soon. 
[02:57:00]  1027 WNEW.  I think we're going late tonight.  Last day before vacation.  And we haven't even talked to Kimmy yet from Survivor.  I know.  She's been sitting here patiently.  Watching the shenanigans.  Limo Ann wants to say something.  Anthony, what up?  Ed.  Did he hang up?  He was waiting for a while. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Let's go to Rich.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I got...  One, I learned that the retarded ONA...  The retarded Laverne and Shirley are Martians.  Yeah.  And number two, I have to say it, God bless Psycho Mark.  I miss that crazy son of a bitch.  What an appearance today.  Amen.  Bravo.  He is insane.  All right, cool.  Let's go to Franklin.  Franklin.  Oh, man.  Guys, that was the funniest thing I ever heard.  I was just walking down Fifth Avenue and 14th Street laughing so hard. 
[02:58:00]  A cop pulled me, grabbed me from behind.  He thought I was drunk.  And I said, no, I'm not drunk.  I'm listening to ONA.  And he's like, oh, I understand.  That was the funniest thing I ever heard in my life.  Cool.  Now we're going to bring him in the...  By the way, guys.  In the studio, yeah.  By the way.  Oh, wait.  Oh, if you want to get on Anthony's bad side, do a nickname for him.  Chester.  Chester.  Chester.  All right.  I want to go home.  Oh, you didn't tell the...  Do you want to save it for after?  Save it.  No, you got a few more stories. 
[02:58:30]  That's plenty of...  Joe, what's up?  How are you doing?  All right.  Good.  I learned two things today.  The first thing I learned is that he wasn't well.  Yes.  The second thing I learned is that I wish that people didn't get bonus points for Sex for Sam.  Yeah.  That's really good.  Now, you know something, though, Joe?  He'd have been fired a week later for something else.  Something else.  It was just Psycho Mark's nature.  It was just a matter of time.  Oh, look.  Hi, guys.  What are you two doing?  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Hold on, you hobbits. 
[02:59:00]  This is my show.  Yeah, what happened to Kimmy's show?  Limo in.  Poor Kimmy.  Limo in.  I feel like I've been listening to the Pac-Adams class.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  I mean, ask Kimmy if she's going to be working at Wall Street soon.  Yes, I'll be at Wall Street.  When am I coming working at Wall Street?  Let me see.  Actually, next Wednesday, April 4th, is the grand opening of DV8 with DeAndre.  You can actually call Wall Street up, and you can be put on my guest list. 
[02:59:30]  Okay.  And then, let's see, I think on Friday the 30th, which is tomorrow, I'll be there, and  Rayna is going to be there live.  Cool.  Have a great vacation, guys.  Yeah, thanks.  Bye.  How do you guys go on any vacations?  Far, far away.  Psychophartist.  I'm not on vacation, man.  It's like I'm like deep-throating a beer bottle in front of the lady's office, Marion.  Oh.  Oh.  What?  Oh, my God.  Look who's here.  You definitely need help.  We will see you Saturday at the XFL game. 
[03:00:00]  See, my face.  I'll practice my Spanish.  Oh.  Bruce.  Mark.  Mark.  You definitely need help.  Oh.  Dr. Dr.  Dr.  Dr.  Madison.  Hello.  You definitely need help.  Look who's back.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Lady Di and Marion, take a look at what a woman's supposed to be.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah!  Yes.  That's Madison from Paris.  I looked like that when I was 20 years old.  Oh, did you really know why?  Yes, I did.  You were a lot taller.  You were a lot thinner. 
[03:00:30]  I heard you guys had a problem about me, naked bartenders.  Yeah.  I came in here to resolve that problem.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yes.  Bravo.  Marion, she's going to get naked right in front of you.  Madison is always the clincher.  If we never, if we don't get a naked girl in when we really need one, like the day before  a vacation, we can always depend on Madison.  Hey, how long are you guys going on vacation?  Will you shut up?  There's a girl ready to get naked.  We're here.  How long are you going to get naked?  Whoa!  Hey, now.  Yes. 
[03:01:00]  Everyone clapping away.  And the applause don't stop.  Wow.  They keep going.  Who wants a beer?  Who wants a beer?  Hand them out.  Just dole them out to anyone underage.  Just don't give it to the Penguin and the Hobbit.  Why not?  They've had quite enough.  Alcohol is wrong.  Right.  We don't.  We don't.  We don't.  Second Mark knows.  Step three.  Only at step three.  I don't.  Second Mark said you're a goddamn alcoholic.  You're an alcoholic. 
[03:01:30]  Now go have another freaking drink, you fucks.  Your ass is an alcoholic.  Oh, my ass is alcoholic.  I want to kiss my ass alcohol.  All right, listen.  Lady Di, nice haircut, by the way.  Thank you very much.  We're used for a bowl.  I know.  You beat me to it.  We're used for a bowl.  You're right.  You're right.  You're getting a hat up with a pair of shoes.  Lady Di, thank you.  What's going on?  Uh-oh.  Whoa. 
[03:02:00]  Do I have a microphone, Mark?  Look at that beer holder.  Look at Obie's.  It's a cozy.  It's a beer cozy.  Yeah, but it's too phallic, man.  It's too phallic?  It's too phallic.  I'm not going to...  That means it looks like a big sea coming out of you.  I'm not going to go down on the beer that looks like a sea.  Right.  Robin would.  It's a beer and it's a girl, so...  Do you suck your beer?  Suck my beer.  I had to yank it out there.  That's good. 
[03:02:30]  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Marion wants to do the same move.  Is that okay?  It said...  But she wants to use a keg.  And she wants to put the...  Yeah, keg.  I was going to say she wanted to put the bottle in sideways.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No.  She's got a keg in there.  All right, hold on.  Oh, I have.  Hold on.  This guy's got a question for Kimmy from Survivor.  Tom, what's up?  Tom?  Tom?  Hey.  You're finally on the radio.  What's up?  Hey, Kim.  I was just wondering if you were happy to see the other contestants fall into the fire. 
[03:03:00]  Do I keep that?  I'm happy to see gentlemen.  It's got the guy.  Oh, look at that.  Madison is now giving a beer to Kimmy.  Which one is this?  Okay.  Bud Light is okay because that's a sponsor.  Okay.  There's a beer between Kimmy's breast right now, and Madison took it out and drinks it.  Nice.  Very talented.  Nice.  Well, and it's...  And look at that.  She had the long neck in her mouth, and it's foamed over all over the...  Oh, that's a little...  A little premature there. 
[03:03:30]  No, I was not happy that Mike fell in the fire.  No.  Come on.  You don't wish that on anybody.  Oh, but you can wish somebody a shot.  Oh, come on.  He's been holding a 30-year grudge for crying out loud.  Lady Di.  Yes.  It's your birthday when?  Monday.  April 1st.  No, sorry.  Happy birthday.  No, fuck it.  The second one's got a beer bottle and it's flying himself.  Give me a full one.  Give me a full one. 
[03:04:00]  Hold on.  It's a family show.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  We all can't talk at the same time.  And, Marion, clean up your dirty mouth, will you?  I'm sorry.  Filthy mouth, Marion.  You're a filthy mouth.  Hey, he's not...  Marion.  Marion.  Marion, we're just telling you not to curse.  And you're cursing.  You're cursing.  You're cursing.  It's obvious.  Now, Psycho Man, she asked you not to call her a whore.  It's obvious she's not a whore, Anthony.  Who would pay for that?  I know. 
[03:04:30]  I'm acting.  I'm acting.  Psycho Man has the beer in his crotch.  He's humping the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  And now the beer is fizzing all over the place.  I will see you Saturday.  I'll be acting.  I guess Mark has nothing else to hump.  I mean, I guess he doesn't have a girlfriend somewhere.  Chunk in the crotch.  What?  I guess you don't have a girlfriend.  Where's your girlfriend?  Does he say it?  I wanted questions from you.  I asked you. 
[03:05:00]  He's humping on a beer bottle.  I guess he doesn't have a girlfriend.  Psycho Man.  You must go home every night.  No, no, because I wouldn't touch you with my thing.  I'd only touch you with a beer bottle.  I wouldn't want you to tell me what you're saying.  Psycho Man, they're not whores, so don't call them whores.  I want you.  Tell the animal whores.  I want you to tell me.  I want you to tell me.  I want you to tell me.  Okay.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Whore.  Whore.  Lady Di.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Lady Di, what would you like for your birthday? 
[03:05:30]  You're a whore master.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  When someone comes back with something like that.  Get out.  Excuse me.  No way.  Get out.  It's true.  Marion, you're cursing.  See, bouncer.  Why is he calling me a whore?  Yank her out.  Pull her out.  Get out of here.  You're a whore.  You know, Steve C. had to remove Marion from the studio.  Steve C. had to physically remove Marion from the studio. 
[03:06:00]  Now what am I going to do?  Go have your soul.  What do you want for your birthday, Lady Di?  Hug for men?  What I want is a beer and...  Hey, guys.  That's what I'm doing, man.  You can drink all the beer you want.  I don't hug anybody.  Not at all?  I hug my mommy, and I hug my girlfriend. 
[03:06:30]  That's the only hugs I ever give out.  Hugs are special to me.  What about a handshake?  What?  A handshake.  I don't want to give you a handshake either.  It's like it's your birthday.  When's your birthday?  April 1st.  All right.  Come in on your birthday, and I'll give you a handshake.  I can't come in on my birthday.  That's a Sunday.  Right.  Dude, there ain't enough beer.  Ever.  Oh, what's going on?  Yeah, but you're not supposed to curse.  And he's going to call me a whore master, so I'm calling him right back. 
[03:07:00]  Are you really mad?  I'm mad at him, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who farted?  Who farted?  You did.  That's your breath blowing back in your face.  No, that's you.  So, you're not going to call me a whore, so I curse my back at him.  Everyone's a whore right here.  You're a whore.  I know I'm a whore.  You're a whore master.  I love being a whore.  You're a whore master.  I'm a whore.  Oh, I'm a whore.  I'm a whore master.  He's a whore master?  Let me call Superman.  Who, who, who.  I'm okay.  Everyone just calm the F down.  I'm going to get him in front. 
[03:07:30]  I'm fine.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Believe me.  Not especially on the radio.  He don't call me a whore on the radio.  I'm sorry.  Not when I know people I know are listening.  I'm going to call him a whore.  I'm going to call him a whore.  No.  Shh, shh, shh.  I'll go.  No.  He's just joking.  I know, but he can't.  He's just joking.  If he could tell me he's joking, I could take it, but I'm joking with him.  But he ain't going to call me I'm a whore and I'm going to sit here and take it.  Who's the one who lives up?  There's a sign up there.  I live in Elizabeth.  Why?  That's the highest point. 
[03:08:00]  Just let them talk.  They need to talk.  They need to talk?  I'm fine.  Believe me.  You all right?  Oh, yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm ready to punch him in the head, but I'm fine.  I know.  I know I can't keep cursing.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Rick.  Okay.  Here goes Cycle Mark.  But he doesn't know where to call me.  I thought it'd be.  Don't curse me.  Don't hear about that.  It was fun.  Yeah, it was fun, right?  Oh, yeah.  It was real fun.  I'm coming a whore.  Look, look.  Don't start crying now.  Don't start crying about you, Ben. 
[03:08:30]  All right?  What's going on, you guys?  I'm not.  I can't take the hand away.  I can't take the hand away.  I don't care if you're going to call me something.  You can't take the hand away.  Don't call me a whore.  You can't.  No.  You can't.  Don't call me a whore.  What's wrong?  What?  What's that call?  Well, that's crazy.  I'm a troll.  Troll.  Troll.  Troll.  Martian.  Martian.  Martian.  That's fine.  I don't care.  But don't call me a whore, Mark.  I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore, no. 
[03:09:00]  Say it again.  I'm not a whore.  Say it.  Say it louder.  Don't call me a whore.  Don't call me a whore.  Get over here.  Say it.  Leave me a whore, okay?  All right.  Wow.  I don't like being called a whore.  Relax.  Don't call me a whore.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Simmer down.  Fool boy.  Simmer down.  Nicey nice, okay?  Everyone is nicey nice.  Right.  Now, you're a whore.  Yeah, well, so are you.  You're a whore.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Let's see.  He's having a good time.  All right, Ed. 
[03:09:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  The guy is too funny.  He has no, I mean, he's got no boundaries.  Kimmy, are you bored?  Oh, no.  You should be driving in the car listening, so at least I get to witness it firsthand.  Okay, good.  It's a freak show.  I swear to God.  What?  What happened?  Clown chest.  Stop that too.  No, no, no, no, no.  Listen.  Who stepped through that freaking door, it's fair game. 
[03:10:00]  What do you think?  We all come through here and we don't get abused?  I don't mind being abused.  Well, then what's wrong with me and Calvin?  I don't mind being told him.  Call me a Martian.  Call me not.  How about a Martian whore?  Well, he is my least.  I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.  You're a whore.  You're a whore.  You're a filthy, animal, disgusting whore.  Leave.  Leave.  Get out.  Now.  Jump off a building.  Go to yourself.  Throw yourself in a handshake.  I'll tell you what.  Go get a bolo. 
[03:10:30]  I don't want a bolo.  I'll tell you what, Mark.  You jump off the building first.  I'll follow you.  Who got it?  Let's go jump off the building right now.  I'll put a parachute on and then you can follow me down.  You got the answer for it.  I'll say whore.  Okay.  I'll follow you.  I snort.  All right.  Look.  What's going on?  Who's buying drinks after the show?  Who's blowing?  Wow.  Unbelievable. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  We should take a break here.  Madison from Privilege Gentleman's Club.  Thank you, Madison.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Everyone will go see you, right?  This weekend?  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Marion, what's wrong?  You guys working out out there?  I'm fine.  Yeah?  He's got me cracking up now.  Does he?  Oh, he does?  He's got me laughing.  I don't like being called a whore, and I got kind of offended when he called me a filthy  whore.  Are you a filthy animal whore, by the way? 
[03:11:30]  I don't care, but I got kind of offended when he called me a filthy whore.  Martian whore, a filthy animal, Martian whore.  But I'm fine.  I'm all right now.  You're a Martian!  Are you a fan of Kimmy's from Survivor?  Do you watch the Survivor?  I never followed the Survivor series.  That's what I was talking about.  Survivor series is WWF.  I never followed the Survivor program, I should say.  I never followed it.  A little too intelligent for you?  No, I never bothered.  Why?  I never wanted to.  Why?  I always watched something else on TV.  You watched the mustache channel? 
[03:12:00]  No, I never watched the mustache channel, but I mean, no, I watched the wrestling.  You watched the mustache channel?  I know I can groove my mustache.  I watched, I watched, you see a part to the left and to the right.  I watched the wrestling.  Okay, yeah, I watched WWF and WCW.  Yeah.  And I watched other programs.  I never got into Survivor.  All right.  And everything.  Well, you just hurt her feelings, yeah.  Well, I told her that, yeah.  I mean, I watched the last episode of Temptation Island. 
[03:12:30]  But she did read it up on my bio or something.  Did you?  What do you know about Kimmy?  I read that she was a bartender on Long Island.  I read it in the New York Post.  Hey, look at that.  New York Post.  Wow.  I read the papers.  I read.  Really?  Yeah, I do.  She wants a pushback channel.  Yeah, yeah, I do.  I see you all on a picture all the time.  Ah, there you go.  She always has a comeback for you, Ma.  I'm fighting back.  Thank you, Anthony.  And it's just as funny as what you're saying.  Can we bring Lady Di back because her birthday is in a couple days, and she's having a tough time.  What about Kimmy? 
[03:13:00]  Poor Kimmy, man.  She comes on finally.  You know, she's been a fan of the show.  She's on Survivor.  And we finally get her on, and she can't get her word in edgewise.  And I drove all the way from Long Island.  Which you don't know how to get her.  Oh, God.  What happened there?  I just artificially inseminated her.  He got hugged by a Martian.  She just hugged?  Did she just hug you, Psycho Martian?  It's all true.  He got hugged by a Martian.  Yeah, I'm sure that'll last for a while.  I'm back to my house and...  I'll say I'm sorry.  You're my junker, Hummer.  I'm going to take you back and just give you a good rogering as the English is saying. 
[03:13:30]  No, thank you.  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  Is Kimmy going to wow us?  It's not Wednesday.  Aw, see, you talked a good game on the phone. 
[03:14:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Hey.  When you guys, you guys actually talked to my brother, my brother said that there was quite  a possibility.  Mmhmm.  Mmhmm.  Mmhmm.  That uh, I would wow you.  But it's not Wednesday!  I know this could be whip them out whenever.  I know that.  Rick, she is to be booked for the Wednesday after vacation.  Medium.  She said she taught everyone in Australia how to wow.  Yes, I did.  That's good.  The aborigines.  Apples.  Wow.  What about what's in my pants from another studio? 
[03:14:30]  What I play?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll put you in your private studio.  No one watching.  Today or next time?  Oh, see what's in my pants?  No, I could do it today because I have a reason, but I can't tell you, obviously, that I would do it.  Oh, I got you.  She's got the old immunity idol down there, I think.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't.  No?  Okay.  But I can't.  Sorry.  I was making an assumption and made an ass out of myself. 
[03:15:00]  You make an ass out of mumption when you make an assumption.  What?  You have a reason why you don't want to do it?  Well, because I want to make sure you bring me back.  Oh, my God.  That's a no-brainer.  That's a great tease.  She's got to do it today.  And then you do the wow next time.  Oh.  You don't just want to double whammy in one night next time?  See, I think she's just teasing it.  I think so, too.  Well, I guess you're just going to have to bring me back.  Oh.  You are a Long Island girl. 
[03:15:30]  Look, I didn't even get dinner.  Come on.  Oh.  She's not even going to get dinner.  Oh, psycho, Mark.  Put your pants back on.  Put your pants back on.  Anthony, Diamond Vision.  Yes.  Opie, you had this done.  You are so happy with your eyesight.  Yes.  Did you talk to your daughter about Diamond Vision?  Yeah, Dr. Philotov performed over 6,000 surgeries, went to Harvard and Yale. 
[03:16:00]  What more can we tell you?  Opie, tell a little bit about your experience so I can just put this copy down.  I want her to do What's in My Pants.  She can take over and I can finish my pants.  You don't need your eyes for What's in My Pants.  I want to make sure my ears are okay.  But if the eye does.  Who wants Kimmy to play What's in My Pants?  Even Madison from Privileged Gentleman's Club is raising her hand.  All right. 
[03:16:30]  Now we're having fun.  Even Arnold won.  And she just said, all right.  Jamaican Mike is holding up two hands.  And what is that?  That's three things you got up over your head.  Where's Rick?  Why isn't Kimmy and others?  I'd like to volunteer my studio.  All right.  Follow us, Steve.  We swear nothing.  Yeah.  Well, make sure everyone's cold.  We swear.  Yeah.  There will be no hijinks.  Mark wants her to use his phone.  Yeah, use my phone.  Rick, get her set up as we get this Diamond Vision read out of the way. 
[03:17:00]  And that'll be the show set.  That's the clincher.  That'll be the grand finale.  Okay, then let me plug my places that I'm working.  Oh, my goodness.  Why?  You can plug now.  Okay.  And you can plug after.  Okay, really quick.  Oh, she brought a book.  Hang on.  I did not forget a whole book.  CPI is having a grand opening for the Hamptons.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  2001.  Shut up.  Don't ruin it.  I'll kill you.  Rick, you ass F.  Yeah.  So, CPI, it's the grand opening on April 4th and April 21st. 
[03:17:30]  That phone's going to be at the grand opening.  Okay, and it's hosted by Vic Latino.  So, you guys got to go there.  Yeah, yeah.  Blue and Garden City is having a big old party on Saturday night.  And you got to come to that.  And, you know, Budweiser and Bud Light might be giving me Yankee tickets if some more people go.  Oh, look at that.  So, you guys will be helping me out.  And, of course, there's my Wall Street, where I've been at for a couple of years now.  Right.  Wall Street.  You can just call up Wall Street and Hop Box at 979-1090. 
[03:18:00]  That's 631-Ari-Cote.  And tell them that you want to be on my guest list.  Okay.  And I'll let you guys get on.  And this is the promise I'll make.  When we get closer to some of those dates, you call the show.  We'll make sure we give it another push.  Yes.  Now, follow Rick.  Okay.  All right.  I'll shut up now.  No, you come back in when you're done.  Yeah.  By the way, it needs to be said that Kimmy is beautiful in person.  That show did not do her justice, right, Sigmar?  She's thin and tan and cleaned up. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, she was a mess on the island, quite frankly.  Right.  Okay.  Anthony Diamond Vision and Dr. Philtoff.  Yes.  Yes.  You're doing both parts.  I'm seeing 2015.  Opie Diamond Vision and Dr. Philtoff.  Yes.  Now, you go yes, yes.  Dr. Philtoff.  I did all the research for everyone, basically.  If you want to say something I say, some people say, Kimmy.  See, Kimmy's already on the line.  Now, what do we do?  You finish the read.  What read?  Oh. 
[03:19:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  You know what to do.  Get in the car.  You know what we have to do?  We have to do the comparison.  You've got to get...  You're going to kill me, but you've got to get Kimmy on one phone.  Hey, hey, I know what you're going to say, and just shut up right now.  The image is killing me.  And Lady Di on another phone.  Just to get the comparison.  Oh, my God.  Would you use your cell phone?  Oh, what?  I don't have a cell phone. 
[03:19:30]  Like, find velvet and then steal wool.  That's what I think the contrast would be.  Anthony, Diamond Vision, Dr. Philotoff.  If you're thinking about getting your eyes done so you can see really, really well, I'm seeing 2015, give them a call for a free consultation.  1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020, right?  Right.  You call them, they give you the free consultation, they'll put your mind at ease, because, quite frankly, it's scary when you think about it, but you'll go in, you'll get your consultation, and you'll realize that it is a piece of cake, okay? 
[03:20:00]  How long is this going to go on, Opie?  Take my word.  God gave us two eyes, but there's only one choice, Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  1-800-984-2020.  Anthony, we've got to play a couple commercials.  We're coming back with Kimmy from Survivor playing What's in My Pants.  We've got to crown the best-ass winner, and then we'll get the hell out of here, and we'll go on vacation for a little while.  You people never cease to amaze me.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, God's the gas!  This is a stupid radio show. 
[03:20:30]  Relax.  Wonderful.  And while we're at it, we can light up a tube and walk on.  Best quality radio.  Damn straight.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  It's D-O-N-A-Show.  We're going late tonight.  We're trying to get out of here.  We've got to start our vacation.  We will not be in tomorrow, but we've got lots to do still.  So we've got the naked Madison in the studio serving everyone beers from Privilege Gentleman's Club down there on the Lower East Side. 
[03:21:00]  And we have Lady Diana phone.  She wants to play What's in My Pants.  And we have Kimmy from Survivor on another phone that wants to play What's in My Pants.  And we also have to announce the winner of the Best Ass Contest.  We have a trip to Las Vegas that we have to give away today to the winner.  Thanks to Gear Magazine.  And thank you, Pinnacle Horny Goatweed, for sponsoring the Best Ass Contest.  I'm looking at the bank of phones here with everything written on it.  And I see Kimmy for What's in My Pants.  Yes. 
[03:21:30]  Very hot.  And then right above it, Lady Di for What's in My Pants.  The Contra, it's good and evil, yin-yang, positive-negative.  So obviously we have to go to, hmm.  Who should we go to first?  Gee, I wonder.  Hmm.  Shut up, Marion.  Shut up, whore!  Kimmy?  Yes?  Kimmy.  Yes?  How are you doing?  I'm good.  How are you?  You're all set up in there. 
[03:22:00]  Yes, I am.  You have, obviously, the phone.  I have the phone.  And you have your privacy.  Well, yeah.  What do you have?  As much privacy as I have in the Outback.  What do you mean?  Who's in there with you?  They're telling the votes for the butt contest.  Oh, the best-ass contest.  Oh, wait.  So someone has to be in there for it?  What?  So two guys have to be in there for that?  I think so, you know.  Wait, wait.  Just in case one of them passes out.  Let's guess.  You want to see the contrast? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Kimmy, somewhere in the building, lots of guys in the room with her.  Hold on a second.  Lady Di.  Yes, hi.  You ready to play What's in My Pants?  I sure am.  Where are you?  Where am I?  Yeah.  Um, where am I right now?  Yeah.  I'm downstairs.  Downstairs?  Yes.  And how many people are in the room with you?  How many people?  There's no one in the room with me right now.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Back to Kimmy from Survivor.  Okay. 
[03:23:00]  All right, Kimmy.  Yes.  Well, we've got to play the theme song for you.  Yes, you do.  You love the theme song.  I do.  All right.  Where's the theme song?  Stink.  Mark, what's wrong?  That is so friggin' funny.  What's wrong?  What's behind me?  There's a friggin' Martian standing here to give me a pack rub.  No, it's the penguin with a blonde wig.  I love the penguin.  Dude, how many beers would it take to sleep with her?  There ain't a brewery big enough to brew it.  You're talking...  Believe me.  You're talking H and X.  H and X. 
[03:23:30]  Ain't ever, ever, couldn't ever, ever happen.  Everyone shut the F up because Kimmy from Survivor is going to play the first ever celebrity  What's in My Pants.  I thought you were playing the theme.  All right, here it is.  You're talking about the theme.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  What's in my pants?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  And guess what's in my pants? 
[03:24:00]  Steve.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Anthony from the newbies?  Yeah.  You want to explain what's in my pants really fast?  Of course.  We have the lovely Kimmy from Survivor 2.  She is in one of the studios with a phone.  We will ask her to rub the phone on her most intimate of areas in various fashions,  up and down, side to side, circular motion, based on the sound only.  We will guess what hairstyle she's sporting in that area. 
[03:24:30]  Ah, the special Survivor 2 edition of What's in My Pants.  Nice.  All the way to the Australian foot.  That's good.  So the choices, of course, are the full triangle, which we will call the outback,  in a little commemoration of the Survivor 2, 
[03:25:00]  or the mohawk, which we will now call the aborigine.  Okay.  The Hitler mustache.  What can we call that?  The boomerang.  The boomerang.  Oh, my God.  You are a genius.  The boomerang.  Hey.  And, of course, well, the wood floor. 
[03:25:30]  Didgeridoo.  Didgeridoo would be the racing stripe.  Why is that?  Because it's just long and thin.  Didgeridoo.  All right.  Well, we're ready to play What's in My Pants with Kimmy out of Survivor,  the Australian outback.  Who will have a lot of plugs after she does this for us.  Yes.  And that's okay with us.  Kimmy, are you ready to play?  Yes, I'm ready to play.  But, well, it's been brought to my attention that we could possibly use for the long and thin racing stripe. 
[03:26:00]  We could call it the Mitchell.  Mitchell.  Mitchell.  The seven-foot white guy.  Right.  Of course.  All right.  Kimmy.  Yes.  That wasn't my idea.  I didn't think it was quite that funny.  Remember, no underwear in the way.  This has to be on.  I know.  You think I'm wearing panties?  No, I just wanted.  Oh.  No, I'm wearing tights.  I had tights on because I was going to come in a skirt earlier, but then I went out and it was cold.  Oh.  All right.  Who's in there with you?  I don't know.  I've got a couple guys in here. 
[03:26:30]  That would be Rick and Steve.  Rick and Steve.  That's pretty accurate.  That makes perfect sense.  All right.  We're ready.  Don't worry.  Rick's gay, so he won't care.  Yeah.  I'm in the corner anyway.  All right.  If you would take the phone now.  Yes.  Special Survivor 2 edition of What's in My Pants.  Let's hear it.  Let's come.  Survivor 2 edition.  Uh-huh.  Where do you want me to put you on?  I want to hear the sound again.  Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, there you go. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, he's just sitting there going, come on, rub it on there.  Well, yeah.  All right.  We're ready.  All right.  And rub it up and down.  Okay.  Up and down first.  Okay.  Hang on.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  All the guys are watching.  Up and down.  Hang on.  If they reen it.  Okay.  I already know, but I need to hear it.  Yeah.  I need to hear it.  I know.  Yeah.  That's very obvious.  Go ahead.  All right.  Side to side.  Okay.  Hang on. 
[03:27:30]  Okay.  And in the circular motion.  Hang on.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Boy, this is a difficult one.  I got a little confused there.  How about up and down one more time?  Up and down?  Yeah.  They're peaking.  Of course they are. 
[03:28:00]  All right.  Anthony, it's to you.  All right.  I got...  You know something?  I'm going to go against my better judgment.  Because I know what you want to say.  I know what I want to say.  I know I can be tricked today.  Oh, God.  This sucks.  No, no.  Thank you.  No, I'm going with my first instinct.  I am going to say... 
[03:28:30]  A koala bear.  No.  No, I am going to say...  A koala bear.  A koala bear.  A koala bear.  A koala bear.  All right.  Don't give your answer until everyone guesses.  I'm guessing wood floor.  Wood floor.  It's to Opie.  I don't even have to think.  What?  Wood floor.  All right.  Madison from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  What do you think?  Forest Hills.  Forest Hills.  What is that?  What do you think she's got?  The Mohawk.  The Mohawk.  The Mohawk?  I say the Mohawk.  Definitely.  The favorite of the stripper, the Mohawk.  I say the Mohawk.  All right.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Jean Benet. 
[03:29:00]  The Jean Benet.  The Jean Benet Ramsey.  And Gorilla Boy.  Gorilla Boy in the studio.  Boomerang.  Australian well-groomed boomerang.  Which we know is the Hitler mustache.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Anyone else?  Going to hazard to guess?  To make money.  To make money.  I'm going to say wood floor.  Wood floor.  Think of your best mind.  Best mind.  All right.  Kimmy, if you would please tell us what is in your pants. 
[03:29:30]  A freshly shaven wood floor.  I took extra plastic hair this morning.  You shaved that this morning?  Yes.  See, Opie, I was thinking the wood floor would have more of a stubble sound.  So I was thinking there was some soft hair padding down there.  But I went with my instinct and she didn't need just shaven this morning.  That was the smooth sound we were hearing of bare skin, no stubble on Kimmy, our first-ever celebrity. 
[03:30:00]  Guess what's in my pants.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Wonderful.  My God.  Go that way.  Hey, Kimmy, how did you keep that trimmed in the outback?  Oh, my God.  I did.  And I had to wax before I went.  And what it looked like when you got home.  What's your normal style if you're not allowed to touch it?  What does it grow into?  It doesn't grow. 
[03:30:30]  I shave just about every day.  I just keep it done.  Hands full of Jiffy Pops?  Nothing like that?  No, you know what?  I was only in the outback for 15 days since I had gotten waxed before that.  Let me tell you, it's so weird when you haven't had hair down there for years.  All of a sudden, like, it's growing in for a couple weeks.  It's like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tell us more.  Tell you more.  Like a porcupine.  You know what I'm telling you is that my whole family just stopped listening right now.  Maybe it changed in the past minute. 
[03:31:00]  You want to play again?  I could have grown in.  A baby porcupine.  You never know.  Kimmy, you want to plug something?  Gosh, you want me to keep plugging?  Insert joke here.  CPI, Blue, and Wall Street.  Just call those clubs and find out when Kimmy's going to be there from Survivor, right?  That's right.  All right.  Come back in the studio.  Thank you.  I miss you guys.  Yeah, come on back.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  She misses us.  Lady Di.  Yes, hi.  Your pants are down? 
[03:31:30]  My pants are down?  Yeah.  Yes, they are.  All right.  Okay.  We have to do it.  You know it.  God damn it.  Listen to the contrast.  All right, Lady Di, if you will.  Yes.  Rub the phone.  Okay.  Sideways or up and down?  Who cares?  Who cares?  Okay.  And throw it out afterwards.  Poor God damn phone.  That foot in the right.  Okay, you got that?  No.  Rub it again.  You want me to do it again?  All right.  Go up and down.  Push hard and just do it.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[03:32:00]  What are you using the end?  You listen in?  Did you get that?  Are you using the end you listen in?  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am.  Stupid, stupid, poor.  Hey, hey, hey, why don't you use, why don't you put the end of the phone you talk into?  Yes.  And use that end to rub on yourself.  Okay.  And then let me do it one more time.  With the cord.  Huh?  Do you want me to do it one more time?  Say, Mark said, choke yourself with the cord. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, you stupid.  Only if he goes first.  Lady Di, do you understand how this works?  Yes, I do.  You'll have to use the end of the phone that you speak into.  Yes, sir.  How are you doing it?  Now do that and rub up and down.  Okay, I will.  All right.  Oh, God.  Hello?  Oh, yeah, hello.  Yes.  Okay, now back and forth.  Back and forth.  Okay.  Did you get that? 
[03:33:00]  Damn swamp.  Watson, come quick.  I need you.  I'm going to smash my invention called the telephone.  Damn me for inventing the phone, Watson.  Damn me.  All right.  Oh, man.  Okay.  The circular motion.  The circular motion.  Hold on.  Yeah.  The most painful.  Oh, God.  What is it?  Sounds like a raccoon's in the garbage.  All right.  How is that? 
[03:33:30]  You don't want to know.  Raccoon in the garbage.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Oh, God.  All right.  Our choices in commemoration of Survivor 2.  Mangy Dingo.  Koala Roadkill.  You guys are so bad.  Go ahead.  Dust Bowl.  Okay.  And aborigine ass.  Don't forget Michael's hands after. 
[03:34:00]  Any other guesses?  Michael's hands.  Any other guesses?  Shut up.  She just writes one of the best lines.  That would be very funny.  Don't forget Michael's hands after he burned him in the fire.  The skin hanging all over the pool.  Alligator.  Crocodile Roadkill.  Go ahead.  All right.  I'm going to say silly putty on the barbershop floor.  No.  I'm going to say, I don't even know what to say.  What was that?  Castro and a leg lock. 
[03:34:30]  Jesus Christ.  A skimmer after a Wookie pool party.  Go ahead.  What are you sporting there?  You want to know what I'm sporting right now?  Not really, but.  You don't even care.  Are you done dancing?  Somebody sounded like, it sounded like an old realistic walkie-talkie being dragged  across the Rattles driveway.  Come on, Keith.  Hey, Kimmy, you got a guess? 
[03:35:00]  That thing has never been groomed.  Anything in its life.  It's never seen scissors, razors, teeth, and wax.  All right.  Kimmy, I mean, Lady Di.  Yes.  When was the last time you used that thing?  When was the last time I used what?  When was the last time that was used for the purpose it's supposed to be used for, except  for waste removal?  Oh, man.  Do I have to answer that?  Yeah.  Yes, you do.  It's been a while.  How long?  It's been a long time.  The cobwebs? 
[03:35:30]  The cobwebs.  The cobwebs.  I don't think so.  All right.  How long?  Give us years.  You want me to give you the years again?  Yeah.  Okay.  What smells worse?  Why are you sure tonight?  What smells worse?  Kimmy, after she was in the Outback for two weeks, or Lady Di, after she pulled her pants  down?  Lady Di.  That is not nice.  That is not nice.  Come on.  You're right.  That's not nice.  That is not nice.  We are both very clean people. 
[03:36:00]  Is it true that sprinklers just went off in the room you're in?  Uh, no.  All right.  What do you have?  Yeah.  All right.  Do you want to know what I have?  Yeah.  He's a little flocking homer.  Wait.  Yeah.  I hope he just hung up.  Oh, my God.  In other words, who really cares?  All right.  We'll wrap up the show next and tell you who won the best-ass contest, finally.  All right.  Naked girls. 
[03:36:30]  All right.  Naked girls.  All right.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  All right.  Or no.  Oh, porno.  Not good for you.  Not good for you.  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time?  A stupid program called the Opian Anthony Shelf.  1027-799.  All right.  We've got to wrap up this show, I guess.  Yes.  Vacation.  But we'll be back in, like, a week.  But God damn, did we have some fun today. 
[03:37:00]  I really want to thank Kimmy from Survivor for stopping by today, Anthony.  Yeah.  She hung in there.  What a sport.  Playing What's in My Pants through our guests.  Has Playboy approached you yet?  Come on.  No, they have not.  See, they always approach the wrong girl.  You would do it.  You would do it, right?  I don't know.  Oh.  No, honestly, I would much rather have a regular job.  Are you allergic to K-roll syrup and powdered sugar? 
[03:37:30]  You know, I don't know that yet.  Okay.  All right.  So we can find that out.  All right.  You'd rather have a regular job.  I'd rather have a, you know, like a legitimate job where I had, you know, money coming in every  year.  But if that didn't come out, if somebody had to get a lot of money, they'd be naked.  Why not?  You know why?  Because in a few years, you know, down the road, and many years in your case, thank you,  yes, you might look back and go, Jesus Christ, you know, I should have done this.  I know.  And then at that point, you won't be able to get into, like, swank or something. 
[03:38:00]  No, you're right.  You've got to get the legit max.  Now, we're looking at swank material right over here.  Yeah, man.  Marion, I would love to see you spread eagle and swank.  Marion could be in swank and biggums.  Yeah.  40 plus.  Oh, 40.  And 40 plus.  Right.  Yeah, 42.  40 plus.  Your ass is 40 plus.  And so bad.  Poor.  I'm telling you one thing.  I lost weight.  I lost a lot of weight.  You're over the breast kill swank, Bill?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Marion in barely legal.  Barely legal, yeah. 
[03:38:30]  In more ways than one.  Kill yourself now.  Barely intelligent.  You're on a set of full of gawk, gawk, gawk, bag and leave.  You did lose weight, by the way.  And you know what?  Where'd it go?  I guarantee you, Anthony.  I guarantee I can make a bet with anybody here within the next three months, I will be  down 35 pounds lighter than what I am now.  These are 24 pounds.  Marion, if you lost 10 pounds, I can tell you where to find it.  Your thighs.  I'm going to lose three a week.  What?  You can lose 100, you stankin' whore.  You're so quick.  I'm watching. 
[03:39:00]  I can walk around with antennas in my ear.  Oh, my.  I'm going to the Opie and Anthony store.  But you know what?  I will be.  Where's my uranium Q38 space modulator?  I will be 35 pounds lighter.  I need my modulator.  I will be 35 pounds lighter, because I want back on my diet.  All right, you'll be halfway there.  I am.  I want back on my diet.  Now you've made me very angry.  Very angry. 
[03:39:30]  I have my surgery in December.  I want back on my diet.  Who cares?  You've got to get her the helmet with the brush on the head.  I'm trying to get her out walking.  Can someone put that sigpick up on the message board?  What?  Marion with the brush helmet from the monsters.  I'm always going to be with my son lately, so.  I'm trying to get her out walking more, just like I am out walking.  I walk every day.  Walk and pull.  Can you do me a favor?  Hey, yes.  When I come back, can I not have this?  Yeah, none of these people will be here. 
[03:40:00]  We just had to test you, Kimmy, to see if you're a true fan of the show.  If the island was like this, if Australia was like this, she'd have voted herself off.  Thank you very much.  I've got to get out of here.  I'm voting for Kimmy.  Looking into the camera.  Write it down.  I'm voting for me because I can't ever take it.  I should be running.  But you know what?  It's not like being heavy.  It's how you can carry yourself.  Marion.  Marion.  I can carry myself pretty good.  How about for old time's sake, you guys?  You guys flash.  Because Kimmy did all the stuff today, you know?  Oh, my.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on. 
[03:40:30]  Come on.  Only if you talk to me a little bit.  You're talking to Marion a lot.  You talk to me a little bit.  Oh, that Christ almighty.  She's getting jealous, Opie.  I will do it.  You will.  Okay, I will.  Marion, will you flash too?  No.  You got those biggins.  No.  Hey, Anthony.  You got any of those goggles they used for the A-bomb experiment?  Now, fix your goggles and do not look at the blast.  Don't look directly at the blast.  You will see it and then feel the shockwave.  It's not your flash.  It comes toward you. 
[03:41:00]  Anthony, it's her birthday on Monday.  It's a happy birthday to her.  Lady, you can't.  She's telling me what to do.  I just told her to ask you.  You got to jump out.  I'm sorry.  I am flashing.  I don't want to flash.  Let me see.  So let her flash.  Watch this reaction.  Marion and Lady Di ready to flash.  It says the Enola Gay rolls down the tarmac.  Her deadly cargo in her belly.  And there's a...  Now to Japan to end the war.  There's a...  Oh, my God.  There's a lot in her belly. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Don't look directly at the blast.  Wesley!  That's like a monkey.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I'd rather have full-blown eggs than my balls cut off.  Jesus.  Ain't Christ. 
[03:42:00]  Lady Di.  Let me ask you something.  What is that?  You keep saying, like, you're in shape.  You're all funny.  I haven't been laid in six years or something.  I don't even know what it is.  But do you see?  Now, look.  All right.  Button your shirt.  There.  Now, leave that.  Open that up.  See where it's buttoned?  Just open it up.  What's not there?  Look at...  No, I've got to say, see your belly.  Do you see your belly?  It's a Greyhound bus tire.  Oh, be nice.  No, it's your belly. 
[03:42:30]  You've got to do something about that or you're not going to get laid.  You're right.  Absolutely.  So what are you waiting for?  That's it.  That's it.  I'm going out for walks.  I'm doing sitting.  You've got to do something.  The public goddamn service.  When I come back here, I will be 50 pounds lighter.  I guarantee you that.  50 pounds lighter?  That's it.  You're going to have to hacksaw off a leg.  That's right.  You've got to do something.  If I have to.  Let me tell you right now.  Yes, Marion.  Yes.  Yes, Marion.  You're annoying.  It's the first.  We'll be up here in a while.  We won't be up here until at least June or July.  Oh, no. 
[03:43:00]  Please come in sooner.  Please.  You know why?  Because there's certain circumstances she's got to work on.  I have to work on.  So I'd rather not say.  Yeah.  For me, I'm okay.  How about a flash then?  I'm not going to see you for a while.  I hope it's a suicide.  When I come up here in two more months, or three more months.  Let's get Marion to whip them out.  Marion, whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out. 
[03:43:30]  Whip them out.  Yeah, there they are.  Jimmy's a pun.  Holy Jesus.  Holy Jesus.  Holy Jesus.  Run the app away and die.  Die, die, die.  That could have fed the whole tribe.  Wow.  Nice flag later.  No, no.  That's something.  Dude, did we just see the International House of Pancakes?  For what?  My God.  Die, die, die.  It's like when he opens up the Ark of the Covenant.  Don't look at it. 
[03:44:00]  What?  See what you did?  Well, look at that.  But you know what?  I work out.  And you know what?  I'm there to work out.  What?  What?  A salami?  I have a...  You work out with a salami?  Jesus Christ.  What the hell do you work out?  I have a power rider.  An elephant.  A power rider?  I have a power rider.  I have a power rider.  I have a power rider.  What is a power rider?  What is a power rider?  It's a head trainer.  Cardio courses where you work out your muscles, your arms, your legs, your back, your butt, 
[03:44:30]  your back.  You work everything out.  Your colon.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  You might be sitting on the machine the wrong way.  Yeah.  Are you in the same room when you use it?  She's had it for six years.  I work out on the Zenith.  It's called a pile driver.  Well, talk it to the mic.  I lost 45 pounds in two years.  You sure you didn't lose two pounds in 45 years?  Jesus Christ.  I got sick and I gave some of it back, but now I'm doing pretty good. 
[03:45:00]  You got sick and you gave some of it back?  You sure did.  We're getting sick now.  You gave it back to us.  I can't believe I saw those hands.  Hey, Kimmy enjoyed it.  Kimmy, it was good, right?  I've lost five pounds in the last three weeks.  You know these guys were full?  The other ones were like, whoa.  Yeah.  I know.  What?  I've lost five pounds in the last three weeks.  I walk every day.  Those are like drapes.  They're not like drapes.  You could have one of those little turning rods on them to get them to a spread of pause.  Like deflated parachutes. 
[03:45:30]  We got a couple of streams coming down.  Show them open.  Show them right to the hills.  They're coming after.  Hit your last shoot.  Those two aren't working.  Holy effing Jesus jumping Jehoshaphat.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I'm definitely going to come back on Wednesday to show you guys.  See?  Kimmy is coming back on a Wednesday to whip them out.  That's the tease for the next visit from Kimmy.  What? 
[03:46:00]  What, Mary?  What?  It looks like you had two gyros on your chest.  And you guys talked to my husband a month ago.  Right.  And he likes to show you.  That poor husband of yours.  Yeah, well.  That poor son of a bitch, right?  Could you imagine her husband comes in and sees Kimmy?  Oh.  And maybe Kimmy wows him.  That would make his head explode.  Right to the gun store.  Get a 12-gauge.  Please.  I got a picture of my husband with me.  There's a three-day waiting period for weapons.  I can't wait.  Do you see who I'm married?  Oh, here.  Take the gun.  You don't believe I was married that day when I pulled you up. 
[03:46:30]  No, we believe you're married.  She doesn't wear a ring.  No, I am.  You don't wear a ring.  You know why I don't wear my ring anymore?  She's got a hole in it.  She's got a big necklace out of her big nameplate, but she doesn't wear a ring.  Why don't you wear the ring?  It doesn't fit on your fat sausage fingers anymore?  I don't know.  My fingers don't fit on my fat fingers.  Snossages.  You do have those Billy Barty hands, man.  I don't wear rings.  Snossages.  What the hell's going on there?  Snossages.  I don't wear rings.  You got that tattoo from Fantasy Island hands. 
[03:47:00]  It's like a muffin with a couple of cocktail frames on it.  She looks like tattoos.  But my nails are growing.  Is that it?  All right.  My nails are growing.  Oh.  I don't want to commentate.  I don't want to commentate.  That's the game.  She saves it once a month.  It looks like a vacant lot.  It's like hunting down the rain forest.  I'm waving the light flag in the studio. 
[03:47:30]  Earl's surrendering in the other studio.  He's had enough.  Dumb stupid whore.  How often do you share this message?  You stupid freaking whore.  Die, die, die.  You smell like hot garbage.  How often do you share this message?  Suck my heart.  It was hard.  It was hard.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Hey, Marion.  Justin wants to know if you walk to the fridge. 
[03:48:00]  That's a workout.  She's got a remote control fridge.  She comes to her.  I walked through the fridge.  What happened?  We're running out of dump.  We're running out of dump.  What are we doing?  Quiet.  Who's dumping?  What the hell?  What's the matter?  You didn't say anything.  What did we say?  Who's been saying something?  Nobody cursed.  You had the potty mouth.  Oh, my God.  You're allowed to say box on the radio. 
[03:48:30]  I hope you didn't tell about the box.  Box?  You could totally say box.  What about hot dogs?  Hairy box.  You could say hairy box.  Big, juicy, smelly box.  What about hot dogs?  You could say that.  You're kibase.  What?  Yeah, you're kibase.  How often do you share your kibase?  Oh, Marion, thank you for coming by.  Jesus, Marion.  That was the funniest part of the show.  I think they jumped out of the whole thing.  They jumped out of the whole thing?  We don't know.  Oh, all right. 
[03:49:00]  The genius is at work at NAW.  I thought you could say box on the radio.  You can.  Okay.  Marion, thank you.  I just wanted to know.  Now, go stick some dynamite in your box.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Happy birthday.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Rick is coming down the hall all bummed out.  All pissed.  What's the matter, Rick?  What happened?  They're saying when you can't say shave my box.  You can say it.  You can't shave my box.  What the heck?  Box is box. 
[03:49:30]  It means nothing.  It means nothing.  What about motion?  Motion.  Shave the motion.  That was the funniest part of the show.  We'll have to deal with that.  That's all right.  All right.  Lady Di, happy birthday.  Yes, Lady Di.  Thank you very much.  Very happy birthday to you.  Thank you very much.  To you.  Yes.  Hey, Anthony, can you go give her a hug?  Would you shut up?  Oh, my God.  My God, woman.  What?  My God, why?  No.  I'm not there.  I'm not there.  I'm not here.  It could be.  No, there's no hugging.  I don't hug.  I don't hug anyone that comes in. 
[03:50:00]  Give that hand shake.  Give that hand shake.  No, no.  Look, I don't hug.  How about a rubbing hug?  I will not touch anyone.  A rubbing hug.  Okay, help it.  Can you give that hand hug?  A massage with full release.  How about a runaway?  We don't hug.  We don't hug.  What is this hug?  What is this little house on the prairie?  All you think is used your butt is a missile rant.  This is Batman.  We don't hug.  There's no hugging. 
[03:50:30]  You can't give him a hug for her birthday.  Come on.  Why am I hugging?  There's no hugging in radio.  Right.  Thank you.  No hugging.  What about a handshake?  Happy birthday.  Watch what we do to Kimmy after you guys leave.  You can do hand gestures.  There's no hugging, but sure, the hands down the back of the pants.  No, no.  What are you talking about?  Because she's an alcoholic.  She's not allowed to have any more beer.  She's an alcoholic.  Craig's a fan.  All right, listen.  We've got to announce the winner of the Best Ass Contest.

Don't ever underestimate the psychology in my head.  Are you minifery?  No!  It's our show!  I'm a mad man!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a thought-raving mad person. 
[03:55:00]  No!  I'm getting hit!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the cycle factor in my head.  No!  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?  1-2-7-W-A-W. </pre>
