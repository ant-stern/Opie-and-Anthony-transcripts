<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in vulgar and sexually explicit jokes and banter.  A significant portion of the early show focused on a graphic discussion of a woman's "camel toe" in a lecture video, followed by similarly explicit commentary on a painting of Bea Arthur's breasts.  This was followed by a discussion of a Bill Burr tweet concerning a nude sculpture of children, sparking a debate about the art's appropriateness.  The discussion then turned to O.J. Simpson's armed robbery trial testimony, analyzing his demeanor and account of events, punctuated by further sexually suggestive and offensive remarks from the hosts.  No outside guests were present during this initial segment.  The O.J. Simpson testimony discussion continued into the next segment, focusing on his jovial demeanor and comments to those present during the incident, including the bartender and "towel boy." Legal aspects of the testimony, such as hearsay, were also discussed.

Penn Jillette then joined the show as an in-studio guest, promoting his sea salt chocolate ice cream flavor created for Celebrity Apprentice.  He detailed the creation process, including interactions with his teammates LaToya Jackson (who hadn't heard of Penn & Teller) and Dennis Rodman.  The hosts sampled the ice cream, with enthusiastic discussion of its flavor.  The conversation shifted to Penn & Teller's show *Bullshit*, covering challenges of getting guests, legal strategies to avoid libel,  and their focus on attacking ideas rather than individuals.  They discussed an episode on multi-level marketing and shared personal experiences with Amway and timeshares.  This segment also included a discussion of the upcoming Celebrity Apprentice episode featuring Penn Jillette against Trace Adkins in an ice cream sales challenge.  E-Rock and Sal were also present in the studio for this portion.  The hosts and guests enthusiastically sampled Penn's ice cream ("Swizzle," often mispronounced). They shared humorous anecdotes from past filming, including intentionally lingering on uncomfortable reactions for comedic effect. Penn briefly discussed his Celebrity Apprentice appearance and upcoming shows.  The conversation then veered towards 90s music, sparked by news of Puddle of Mud's singer's arrest.

A lengthy comparison between Penn Jillette and Trace Adkins followed, fueled by anecdotes about Adkins's near-fatal shooting by his ex-wife, house fires, various accidents (including a finger amputation and leg injuries), and his charitable work.  Listeners called in with additional details about both contestants, contributing to the ongoing comparison.  A recurring farting sound effect added to the comedic elements.  This segment continued into the next, focusing on creating humorous lists of positive and negative attributes for each contestant to predict their popularity with "Middle America."  Callers contributed to these lists, adding details like Jillette's atheism, a rumored sex dungeon (revealed by a caller recounting a television show walkthrough of Jillette's home), and nail polish wearing.  Trace Adkins's music, particularly "Arlington," was played frequently. A caller claimed Trace Adkins was the Navy SEAL who killed Bin Laden.  Opie shared a story about a lackluster encounter with Roger Daltrey.  The show then shifted to discussions of upcoming guests Colin Quinn and Guy Fieri, details about Quinn's apartment, Opie's comedy shows, and technical discussions about video editing software.  A recurring obscene, repetitive phrase from a caller was a recurring element, alongside discussions about the podcast's audience growth and the hosts' personal lives.

A subsequent segment featured Sam Roberts discussing his reactions to perceived Twitter attacks and his competitive feelings towards other SiriusXM hosts, including a comment from Jason Ellis. He admitted to jealousy towards other hosts' successes.  DJ Who Kid arrived in a Spock wig and Star Trek shirt due to a promotional bet, leading to a racially charged exchange with Sam, who repeatedly called him "nigger Spock."  The conversation touched on Who Kid's appearance in a pornographic film.  The discussion then returned to the Celebrity Apprentice finale between Penn Jillette and Trace Adkins, with Sam explaining why he thought Adkins would win, highlighting Adkins's near-death experiences and charitable work. Sam recounted receiving negative feedback for his humor about the situation. Multiple callers joined, with one calling Sam a "weasel" for starting online arguments.  The segment touched upon speculation of a fixed ice cream sales promotion in Celebrity Apprentice, and ended with promotion of the Opie and Anthony podcast and upcoming guests, including Guy Fieri and possibly Trace Adkins.  The show then transitioned to Ron and Fez.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6 a.m. and this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  Oh, God!  O.P. O.P. O.P. O.P. O.P. O.P. O.P.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flesh you went.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten egg from sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking tickets?  Wow!  With Opie, the Destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  Well, it doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Of course you did.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, my God. 
[00:02:00]  Of course you did.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Hi.  Look at that.  Yeah, Guyism has a video.  Woman gives lecture with the most obvious camel toe in history.  We were just discussing it before the show, and Jimmy goes,  I Facebook friend requested her.  Yeah, she's a nutritionist.  How do you, uh...  What, do you want to get some nutrition tips?  I do.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm eating pretty good.  Yeah.  Her camel toe is fantastic. 
[00:02:30]  It's so prominent.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  She's gotta be aware of it.  I don't know.  And why aren't people just pointing and laughing at it?  Oh, are you pointing the jack off to it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you doing there, Sam?  We should have this one.  You're just left in there taunting us.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my Lord.  Look at that.  It's too bad.  Oh, God.  It's too bad she's a three.  No, she's cute, man.  No, come on.  I'm telling you, I saw the photos of her. 
[00:03:00]  She's a great body.  She has a very nice body, but her face is rough.  I'm gonna squint us.  Boy, that.  That's a puffy pussy, but that's not...  It's a long pussy.  It could be a deceptive.  What do you mean?  How is it deceptive?  It's all right there.  A decepticon.  No, no, meaning it's not.  It's like I've seen...  That might not be the meaty ones that I love.  As much as that's a sexy look,  some pussies are just really fat but have tiny lips.  If that makes any sense,  they're just puff on the outside.  And those are not the ones I love. 
[00:03:30]  I love how you say it's a sexy look.  It's a look all the ladies are going for.  Oh, they should be.  This is such a rarity.  You want to find a boyfriend,  that's a great look.  She's married,  but you want to find a guy,  that's a great look.  But this is a rarity  to have it on display like that.  You can't even show me.  I can fill up looking at that.  Really?  Meredith should be slicing that open.  You're playing just a little of it.  It's a long nine-minute video.  It's not long enough.  It's fucking great.  I want the trilogy.  When she turns toward the camera.  It's so fucking...  It's right there. 
[00:04:00]  She literally looks...  She looks naked.  Yes, she does.  It looks like they spray-painted on  some fucking...  Fuck.  Whatever color that is.  Pants.  Yeah.  Doesn't that turn you on?  That drives me crazy.  Yeah, but it's also just hilarious.  She's totally shaved.  You can tell through her pants.  Yeah.  She's totally shaved.  Absolutely.  Yeah, that's plump lips.  Oh, my God.  She turns to the left, and then when she turns back to the right, it's on display for everybody. 
[00:04:30]  I'm filling up.  I can't even look at this.  Who isn't looking at that?  Who isn't sitting in that room and just staring at that?  Does the lady on the right know?  Because she's kind of smirking, right?  She is.  I'm going to show you a picture of what I looked like when I was 16.  In the picture at the left, I was 16 years old.  I was in high school.  I think she looks good now.  She's not a picture on the right.  She looks a little better in that picture. 
[00:05:00]  And not only did I look a lot different, I felt a lot different.  And I had a lot of conditions that I didn't exactly know where they were.  She looks better in that picture.  In the picture to the left here.  All right.  She's doing...  Yeah, she's a nutritionist, and she's just, like, juicing stuff.  Yeah, she's just doing...  Look at that guy.  What is he eating?  I had a perpetually bad health.  I didn't know...  And why isn't he staring at him?  Why isn't he just jerking off right in there in the front row?  That's all I'd be doing is...  I'd be out of my mind if I was wrong.  I have a fucking rod right now.  Let me interject.  Oh, it's a cold.  I can't look at that. 
[00:05:30]  At four years old, she couldn't manage to go trick-or-treating to get...  Oh, sit down and shut up.  You're lying, miss.  There's a giant vagina in front of you.  Yes, right.  Stop yapping.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, look at that.  Really terrible.  I felt depressed.  I felt hopeless.  I felt afraid.  I felt anxious.  So, I looked different, but I felt a lot more different than I looked.  My own brother, when he saw me, when I came back from California, I said, wow, what a pussy.  Right.  And I looked like that. 
[00:06:00]  The last time he saw me...  He's driving you nuts, Jimmy.  I got a fucking rod.  I cannot look at that.  Is that you?  I had stomach ulcers, candida, IBS, anxiety, attacks, depression, daily acid reflux.  She's a disaster.  Right.  What about fat pussy?  She has those things?  Yeah.  She had them.  She had.  You might want to get her book.  Whatever the fuck.  Whatever she's selling, I'll buy.  Oh, yeah.  When is she going to talk about the aside, Barry? 
[00:06:30]  Oh, look at that.  That's health benefits.  Holy shit.  All right, dude.  It's out of control.  Light purple.  Light color.  Black is not a good color.  Right.  You got to wear light purple.  Like, light colors.  I want to cup it.  Oh, so do I.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, just take your hand and just cup the whole thing.  Give it a little squeeze.  What's sexier than when a girl from the back bends forward and you can see, like, the puffy  lips from the back?  Oh, boy.  That's fucking makes me.  I saw that in the gym recently.  Yoga pants.  Forward-backwards thing. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my gosh.  It's all about the yoga pants.  Oh.  Yeah.  So, we got that on our Facebook page.  You girls in your vaginas.  There's a few things besides that.  Those are really mainly what my diet looked like.  She doesn't have any, like, inhibitory.  She's no clue.  Inhibitions.  She doesn't know that.  She's got to know that stuff.  She's got to know.  She addressed it.  You know how you look in pants.  She addressed it afterwards.  She was a little amazed.  She's like, I should re-edit the video so it's not.  I don't think she realized that that was.  No way.  She addressed it? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, on YouTube or something.  She's not.  She kind of joked about it.  Really?  Oh, let's find that video.  That'd be fun.  No, no.  It's written.  She wrote it.  Oh, okay.  She's talking about mold.  She can talk about whatever the fuck.  Unsexy shit as her vagina is on display.  IBS and mold, and yet I still have a full rod.  She's a good girl.  Roasted peanuts and sugar.  What is she talking about?  She just didn't.  She looked at this before it was posted and went, yeah, let it fly. 
[00:08:00]  That's good.  Oh, that's true.  I look great.  What?  Unless she didn't post it.  Yeah.  Unless this was done by, like, the people she was speaking for.  How does anybody post it and not notice?  Yeah, yeah.  That gift.  Yeah.  They should have pixelated it, and you'd be like, what the fuck are they pixelating?  Right.  Sam, do you like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, Sam, you like that.  It's fucking hot, right?  Who doesn't like it, but you also got to find the humor in the whole thing?  Even a little faggy boy like you?  Yeah.  You can appreciate that.  Why would you say that?  I don't know. 
[00:08:30]  It's mean.  It is.  It's rude.  It's just mean-spirited, man.  It's cool.  There's another hot thing happening today.  Oh, I'll button up.  Huh?  I'll button up.  He's just going to...  Ant came in here looking all sexy.  Yes.  The Bea Arthur painting.  Oh, God.  Driving men crazy all over the place.  I can't look at this.  You've got to turn this off.  I can't.  I can't.  I really can't.  What would happen?  I'm fucking flexing my rod right now.  I can't concentrate.  Holy fuck. 
[00:09:00]  He's flexing his rod.  Is it going...  Yeah.  But why are you flexing it?  You can kind of control that.  No, you can't.  It's just...  You just want to fucking...  So you're turgid right now.  Yeah, I'm going...  I'm about three quarters.  You're pretty turgid right now.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  She is lovely here.  There's a Bea Arthur painting.  And some idiot, I guess, is going to pay two million dollars for it. 
[00:09:30]  Two million.  Or already has.  They keep cutting off the big titties.  But it's in the paper today.  Yes, it is.  Is it Bea?  It looks like her.  It's supposed to be.  Well, she didn't pose for the picture.  No.  Well, it's in the New York Post.  They got the actual painting.  There it is.  Oh, you got it online, too.  And some dude...  It looks like the same artist that painted the fucking Dirk Diggler pictures in Boogie  Nights.  Yes.  It just is terrible.  It's not very... 
[00:10:00]  It doesn't have much depth to it.  It's not a good painting, really.  And it went for almost two million dollars.  Why?  I don't know.  I guess the artist is...  I didn't feel like reading the article.  I was just staring at Bea Arthur's fucking knockers.  Her hangers.  They are hangers.  She's got some hangers.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It shouldn't have went for two million unless she actually posed for this thing.  It's a terrible painting.  It really is awful.  It's not even done well. 
[00:10:30]  What's the story behind the two million dollar Bea Arthur painting?  Just because it's odd, I guess.  Odd painting fetches 1.9 million.  It's more the mod than the Golden Girls era of Bea Arthur.  People are asking.  An anonymous bidder over the phone.  The artist Curran, who lives in Brooklyn, is known for campy works depicting women in provocative positions.  What's his name? 
[00:11:00]  Curran, it looks like.  How's that spelled?  C-U-R-R-I-N.  All right.  Let's see what else he's got.  The bare-breasted 1991 piece for which the former Maud actress never actually sat was basically panned when it came out by critics.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Some writers even urged art lovers to boycott Curran's shows, but his work is now acclaimed and hangs in museums, including the Whitney.  He's got stuff in the Whitney. 
[00:11:30]  Why boycott his shows?  Nah, that's stupid.  What's wrong with people?  I know.  What's wrong with you that Bea Arthur's fucking tits are...  This is his, uh...  Some of his work?  Some of his work, huh?  If that's what he does and people like it, why would you not want people to go see him?  Is that Belmont Louise or something?  Possibly.  I don't know.  He's got some prego chicks that he's painted.  These look like he put a little more work into, um...  The actual making it look like people. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  Oh, look, pussy.  Let me see.  Well.  Well, what have you got here?  Jesus.  Yeah, the Bea Arthur one's very archaic.  Like, it really is a horrible job compared to other stuff he's done.  It looks stupid, but someone out there said it's a work of art and paid 1.9.  Amazing.  I don't get that art world at all.  Lost in it.  No.  Lost in it.  Some of that stuff just looks ridiculous and people just fucking love it. 
[00:12:30]  You ever have a painting?  I went to the MoMA once with a girl years ago.  The MoMA was...  That's all right.  I think that's where I went.  That's where I lived in Jersey still.  And once in a while you'd stop at a painting and there's something about a certain painting.  I can't even think of it where you just go like...  Like, it just makes the inside of your mouth feel different.  Really?  Or you tighten up your jaw.  Really?  Not bad.  That's interesting.  But it does something to you when you look at it.  And I don't know what makes a painting do that or what doesn't, but I don't get art either. 
[00:13:00]  I look at it and go, what the fuck is this shit?  Yeah, I'm with you.  But once they're like the Scream painting, you look at that and I could see why people  are attracted to that painting.  There's something weird about it.  But can you or is it that you've seen the painting so much that it just becomes famous?  You know what I mean?  No, it brings me into a weird place.  Like if you never saw that painting before and you were seeing it for the first time,  you would still have that same feeling?  Yes.  Like, what is this?  Because as soon as you see a famous painting, you're like, oh, wow.  Hey, there it is.  Oh, there.  Wow. 
[00:13:30]  That's the famous painting.  Wow.  I'm the closest person in the world to this right now.  Right now.  Yeah.  I wonder if I could take it off the wall and get out of here.  You know, when you see it, it doesn't do it.  Can you put the Scream for a second in the Scream painting?  Like, it does.  When you look at it, you wonder, where is this?  What's happening here?  It just does something where you want to kind of look at him.  He's like, ah.  There's something about the photo.  I don't know exactly what it is, but there's something about it that ropes me in. 
[00:14:00]  Well, there's something about it is you feel like anyone could have painted this.  No.  Why, though?  Explain.  Is it the hands on the face?  Yeah, it's distressing.  The way they're gently cupping the face.  It's a distressing painting.  It's a distressing painting, but that's not, I'm not breaking any new ground by saying  that.  No, but I mean, that's the great, I never heard that word for it.  Yeah.  It's the way his long hands are cupping the face perfectly, because the face is kind  of like a light bulb.  Right.  A person is troubled.  There's something about the way the hand is protecting the face or the scream. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know why it makes me go, fuck, that's great.  Yeah, that is a pretty good one.  I don't know why either.  And that's a dummy explanation of why they like that painting.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  All right, there's one that I get like really fucking into.  It's, um, there's this guy.  Something by Mapplethorpe?  Yeah.  He's, uh, he's sitting in a boat and there's a dog, right?  And one's looking one way.  And the other one's just looking the other way.  He seems to just be sitting there going, what do you want from me? 
[00:15:00]  It's, uh, fantastic.  It's terrific.  Yeah.  It's a terrific painting.  Yeah.  Um, did you see what Bill Burr tweeted last night?  Speaking of art.  Ooh, what?  He, he tweeted, uh, a picture of a sculpture and just basically said, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The FBI should really look into the guy who came up with this sculpture.  What sculpture is that?  It's two nude, uh, children. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Apparently boys.  Frolicking.  One is, uh, on his, uh, belly.  Belly.  On the ground.  With his, uh, knees bent.  So, you know, his feet are above his ass.  Right.  He's, uh, kind of there.  Another boy is kind of riding.  His ass.  Sitting on his ass.  Sitting on his ass.  Looking up at the sky and, uh, he's got one arm up.  And they're both nude.  They're nude.  There's a lot of water fountain-y things coming out of it.  And obviously this is in, in, in public somewhere.  I was going to say a public square or a park. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know for sure where it is.  For some reason, you know, children, nude fountains, uh, it seems like everything's A-OK  with that.  But yeah, how do you make that?  How do you go, I'm going to make a sculpture.  Right.  And then you make that and, like, your friends and family, like, wow, you really are a good  sculptor.  But, uh, why'd you do that?  Yeah.  Like, could you imagine, like, I'm a great sculptor and I make that, my brother comes  over and I'm like, Joe, look what I made.  Sure.  And he'd be like, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  What goes through your mind?  Yeah, why?  Because you could, you could have the same two boys having, I don't know, uh, they could  be fully clothed with baseball mitts on.  Right.  And you would still be sitting there going, wow, this guy really knows how to sculpture,  you know, humans.  It's amazing work.  Right.  But they're nude.  But you'd be like, uh.  And the one guy, the one kid sitting on the other naked kid.  It's like, imagine a bunch of people around, your friends, your family, strangers, and it's  under the cover and you're like, here's my new works. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  And you pull the sheet off and everybody's just kind of, oh, nude boys on top of each  other.  When did you get into nude boys?  But, well, let me tell you.  And then you have to try to explain it.  And you've got to try to explain why you decided to do that.  Don't you got to, you've got to think the artist is into some kind of pedophilia if he's,  this is what he's doing.  That isn't just a doodle.  That isn't someone doodling.  Right.  That took a long time and a lot of work to do. 
[00:17:30]  A lot of imagination.  A lot of research.  Yeah.  You have to know the, the young boy body of, like, the back of your hand.  What was Bill Burr's tweet on this one?  Sam?  The FBI might want to take a look at the hard drive of the person that made the statue.  Yes.  Of course.  Of course that should happen.  Jesus.  And why is it in public?  Well, those get a fucking, those get a pass.  I'm not, I'm not for censoring, you know, but it just seems a little strange that, you 
[00:18:00]  know, kid statues have been a staple for, for thousands of years.  Why though?  I don't know.  When did that come about?  When did that become acceptable?  Maybe the whole fucking innocence thing.  Maybe, you know, maybe it wasn't a pedophilia thing to begin with.  Right.  Maybe it isn't always.  Right.  You know, if somebody wants to portray this youthful, innocent thing, but, uh, yeah, now  people just look and go, oh, the old days though, they were always cherubs up on buildings 
[00:18:30]  and fountains and shit like that, but no one really thought much about it.  They had some kind of robe-y thing, I don't know.  Yeah.  These two are completely new.  I don't know.  What about the little kid pissing?  And the one guy has his arm up in the air, like, he's celebrating the fact that he's  mounting the other one.  Yeah.  Louis C.K. did a bit on that in his last special.  He sure did.  The pissing little boy statues.  Right.  Yeah, but that seemed to imply that all gay people were pedophiles.  Well, that's true.  Oh, that's right.  That's what that came from.  Oh, yeah.  That was a bad bit.  We don't like Louis for that.  That's right.  Boo, Louis.  Terrible.  That stupid broad. 
[00:19:00]  Now people on fucking Twitter, hey, Louis, yo, and hey, Louis, we're bashing you.  You know what?  But it's weird.  Like, you look at that.  It is a nice piece of work.  Like, whoever did that is good.  Very talented.  Yes, but every artist in the world or art fan would defend that, and the same people  that would defend that would fucking crucify Tosh for a rape joke.  Right.  Or a pedo joke.  A pedo joke, yeah.  Or any of that stuff.  Oh, I don't make fun of pedophilia.  But you could prominently display it if it's made in bronze. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, as long as you're using bronze.  Yeah, use bronze and everything's okay.  If that was done in butter, I wouldn't get the respect it deserves.  Deserves.  Are you still filling up, Jim?  No, you know what's funny?  My dick is back to snail on my balls sleeping.  My dick is back to snug as a bug in a rug.  Should we go back to the camel toe for you?  Oh, boy.  Jimmy, you would jerk off to that, huh?  I don't know.  Nah, dude.  You know why? 
[00:20:00]  I'll tell you why.  Because it puffs out into a V, like a big, fat V.  Right.  It's not...  It's not what you...  The type that I could jerk off to just camel toe-wise would be if she was sitting on the  floor with her knees raised, kind of like arms around the knees, and you could see it  between the legs, fat.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Or on her hands and knees, from the back, fat.  Oh, right.  But she's got a shitty body.  She's got a little...  There's no real shape to her body.  A little bulbous above the belly there. 
[00:20:30]  And then she's got like some almost...  It almost looks like a pants...  Like pantsuit.  Pants.  I think she has a...  Does that make sense?  Pants.  Pantsuit.  I've seen photos of her.  Oh, she has a great body.  She has a great body.  She does.  Yeah.  It certainly doesn't look like this picture.  And then she's got...  Some new pics of her.  Let's see.  Then she's got flat, awful, stalker patty-type hair.  Stalker...  Awful, stalker patty-type hair.  Hey, what are you talking about?  My hair's beautiful. 
[00:21:00]  Is that her right there on the...  Wow.  Yeah, that's her.  She's a great body.  Oh, man.  Well, why the fuck did she dress so shitty?  Well, maybe she's doing a...  Because she looks great in that picture.  Absolutely.  She's wearing a little...  Like a plaid Catholic school...  Yeah.  Right.  ...skirt.  And a very small top.  Yeah, like an athletic top.  And then she's got like fuzzy boots on.  That looks pretty good.  I gotta say.  Yeah, that absolutely looks pretty good.  I can't believe that's the same person.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Anything else?  The best camel toe picture ever is that girl petting the guy's snake with her legs open  in the skirt.  Do you ever see that one?  It's like a joke picture.  Like the guy doesn't know that this girl's pussy is exposed.  And I guess her boyfriend or friend took the picture.  Really?  Oh, let's find that.  Look, that's one of my favorite giant pictures ever.  Oh.  Look for that, Sam.  Camel toe snake skirt.  You can probably find...  Camel toe snake.  No, uh... 
[00:22:00]  Up the skirt shot girl touching the snake.  I've said...  People have sent it to me.  Jimmy rules.  No, that's wrong.  You...  No, uh...  Go up...  Let me see.  Camel toe up skirt.  Oh, camel toe up...  In park or something.  She's in a park.  Up skirt.  Park.  Yeah, she's...  Google image.  Oh, man.  Where is this gal?  I am seeing some other camel toe. 
[00:22:30]  No, but...  This isn't the worst search we've done.  Oh, you know what, Sam?  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  Not camel toe.  Bear pussy.  Upskirt park.  Yes.  Yeah.  Bear pussy.  Upskirt.  Yeah, snake.  There you go.  Up park or something.  Yeah.  There she goes.  Oh.  Let's see.  Wow.  Jesus.  Make it big.  Look at how fat that pussy is.  Bigger.  I know.  Bigger.  Now, there's three pictures of her, by the way.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Whoa.  I thought it was fake.  It's such a good vagina, I thought it was fake. 
[00:23:00]  But look at how thin her legs.  She's got juicy legs and a cute face.  She's fucking amazing.  Yeah, you'd like that.  Oh.  I'd fucking move her in my house.  Yeah.  But you look for...  There's a couple other ones that are like...  Oh.  Find this series.  So she didn't have any idea.  Come on.  No, no.  I think she did.  She's smiling up at the camera.  Oh, all right.  Like, because the people behind her don't know.  Oh, I see.  Okay, that's one of those.  Wait, is there another one there, Sam?  Yeah, there's another one where she's down there petting to the right.  She absolutely knows.  That's her and her boyfriend.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:23:30]  Damn.  I don't like the snake.  That creeps me out.  But that's a great vagina.  She's got a...  That's a big, fat one, Jimmy.  I'm out of my mind for that girl.  Giant.  Yeah, although the lips are so big and fat, but there's not enough substance to the rest  of it.  Like, I prefer, like, when the inside...  We didn't ask you.  I know, but I just felt like...  That is true.  I just felt like finishing up the lecture with a...  He gets so excited.  He really does.  Yeah, Jimmy.  I'm fucking...  That's okay.  I wish I had a picture of the kind that I love. 
[00:24:00]  Like, that's close.  But you need stuff coming out.  You need some shit falling out.  Yeah, although I could enjoy that.  But sometimes, like, a pussy like that will have giant lips and a tiny clit.  Like, I prefer them to have, like, a substantive clit and, like, a little bit coming out of  the lips.  Like, really nice.  You need, like, a lotto.  You need, like, a fucking...  It's like winning the lottery with you.  I should...  Every piece has to be perfect.  That Bianca Stone girl who I showed you, that girl has the...  Probably the best I've ever seen.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a big...  Even though she had a lot of hair on it, but that's a big... 
[00:24:30]  Well, she did, yes.  ...great vagina.  That I would probably marry.  I don't know.  Is that inappropriate to...  Just marry a girl based on nothing but her badge.  Yeah, it's really shallow.  Well, that's what guys do anyway.  Of course.  To tell you the truth.  Yeah.  All right.  In other news, I want to thank everyone who subscribed to our podcast.  We had a really good first day.  Thanks for the...  Thanks to the fans.  Oh, yeah.  Really good first day.  Indeed, he do.  And a lot of our friends tweeted the fact that we are now in the podcast world, and thank 
[00:25:00]  you to them as well.  I saw Jay Moores just tweeted a little bit.  Jay Moores.  A little bit ago.  Bill Burden and Amy Schumer.  All the big names.  Mark Maron.  In the podcasting world.  Colin Quinn.  Who else?  Kevin Smith.  Ah.  Now you guys got to go on that podcast tour and do all those podcasts.  Yeah, that would help.  A little podcast tour.  It's fun, man.  I mean, you did Rogan's.  I think that you guys should do them all.  Like, fucking go out there for a couple days and fucking do, like, Jay and Kevin and Joe. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  What is this caught on camera video that keeps showing over and over again?  Dumb broad.  Our stroller fucking rolled right onto...  What?  Was there a baby in it?  Yeah.  Right off the fucking platform onto the train tracks.  Where?  Philly.  Philly?  A lot of shit happens in Philly, huh?  Yeah.  She's like, my baby!  Oh, Lord!  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Oh, wow.  Sea lion stops after girl trips and falls. 
[00:26:00]  What?  There's a little sea lion in a tank.  Right.  Right.  Well, they're not showing the girl fall, are they?  What the fuck video is this?  It's stupid.  The sea lion's just...  Following her.  Oh, it's chasing her around.  I don't know.  Oh, they're trying to make a cute little story about it.  I don't know.  Oh, there's the kid falling off the platform.  Yeah, she had a stroller, and she turned her back, and the stroller slowly started rolling 
[00:26:30]  toward the platform.  Whoa.  And fell right off the edge onto the tracks.  You see the little kid just flop out right onto the train tracks.  Why are so many people having problems with train tracks lately?  Because they're stupid, and they don't understand.  It's a giant piece of machinery, and it's a fucking very electric, dangerous trench that  the train is in.  What?  And they stand...  You know, they don't pay attention to anything around it.  Right.  They stand right near the edge of it.  The people are dumb.  Yeah, I'm back to the wall every time.  Oh, yeah, me too, man. 
[00:27:00]  Back to the fucking wall.  I mean, you gotta understand, obviously, there's a fuckload of people taking the train every  day, and the instances of people getting hurt are very rare.  Of course.  People will play fucking Powerball for that, what is it up to, 600 million or some shit?  Right.  They'll play that, and the odds are a lot less, you know...  Better odds will be pushed onto the tracks, right?  So how about you fucking, you know, stay away from the platform?  Good old Center City, Philadelphia.  And if you've got a baby in a stroller down there, you should probably look at it all the 
[00:27:30]  time.  You should probably have your eye on your baby the whole time.  Yeah, that's just a dummy.  Yeah.  Strollers, they're always wanting to move.  They're on wheels.  Right, fuck.  What do you think?  It rolls.  Slight decline.  It's gonna start rolling, dummy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I got some funny texts yesterday.  Apparently, Melissa Stetton there got into a little altercation with Dane Cook.  Why?  At the Laugh Factory. 
[00:28:00]  Does he half own that place?  Dane?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I haven't talked to him in a year.  I think so.  It's very funny.  What do you mean?  I don't think he's got a piece of that place.  I know.  He may.  That's his club, though.  That's his hometown club.  Yeah, yeah.  L.A. guy.  That's what it is, though.  It's kind of like how Jimmy goes to the cellar every night.  Dane Cook goes to the Laugh Factory.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  On most nights working on his shit.  Yeah, because at some point he said, my club or something.  Oh, that's, yeah.  My club meaning, yeah, that's my joint where I go. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  I think.  My club to laugh, actually.  Yeah, that might have just been, like, my place.  Yeah, that's his hometown fucking comedy club.  Yeah.  Was she heckling him?  No, no.  It was because of a tweet.  She gets in trouble for her tweets.  He tweeted, all right, here's what she says.  Dane must have tweeted, girls suck at comedy.  And she retweeted him and said, guys named Dane suck at comedy. 
[00:29:00]  And then that was it.  And then our friend Chris invited her to the Laugh Factory.  I guess he was doing some sets or something.  So Dane shows up to do a set.  So she tweeted again.  She goes, I guess my punishment for making a Dane Cook joke is having to watch his stand-up.  So after the show, he comes up to me.  I'm reading her recitation here. 
[00:29:30]  Her bio blog.  And while I was talking to my friend Chris, held up his phone with the Twitter on it and said, is this you?  And she said, huh?  And then he said, because if this was you, I think you have some balls to come.  Why don't you have the balls to come up to me, to my face and say something mean like that to me in my own club?  So he walks away and I ignore him.  Then he walks back and he's even angrier.  And he's yelling, this is definitely you. 
[00:30:00]  What the fuck is your problem?  So she says, relax, it was a joke.  I'll delete it if you want.  He pulled the friend of his, Chris, to the side and yelled at him for bringing me to the show.  So then he walks back to her again, gets in her face and says, I'm going to ban you for life from this place for talking shit about me.  And I looked at him and laughed.  And he said to my friend Chris, kick this slut out, bros before hoes. 
[00:30:30]  And Chris said, sorry, dude, we'll leave.  So we left.  Did he really say bros before hoes?  I guess so.  Right there he lost me, but I'm so far on Dan's side completely.  Who's the girl?  What's her name?  But that is a good point.  Like, why would you?  I understand you don't want to play.  It's Melissa, Melissa Stenton.  Oh, is that her?  Yeah, that was her. 
[00:31:00]  Like, you don't just walk up and confront somebody for no reason.  Like, you know, I fucking mocked the who.  And when Dolce came in yesterday, I didn't go, hey, I've said all this stuff.  So I understand why you don't just walk up to someone like Dane and say something.  Yeah.  It was, I don't know, it was a tweet.  I guess he tweeted, chicks aren't funny.  Like, girls aren't funny.  She tweeted something back.  Retweeted and said, no, guys named Dane Cook aren't funny.  And then she found out she was going to the club and Dane Cook just happens to show up. 
[00:31:30]  And then she tweets again, like, oh, I guess my punishment for the Dane Cook tweet is having  to watch Dane Cook's set.  And that's it.  Then he came up to her.  He must have seen the tweet and realized this girl was in the club, looked at the picture  and just looked around the club for the girl, for her, found her, and just went up and got  in her face.  I don't know.  Look, I'm not here to defend Melissa Stetton's honor, that's for sure. 
[00:32:00]  But it does seem a little petty on Dane's part.  He's a comic.  I mean, you know, you're going to get shit like that.  It's just rare, I guess, that the person's actually there that's bashing you on Twitter  and you probably take out all the shit that he's gotten on Twitter on her, you know?  Well, I'm surprised why would he tweet that?  Like, again, if that's his opinion, that's fine.  I mean, I'm not saying he's wrong to say it.  But there are some, realistically, there's some funny chicks.  But if you're going to tweet chicks aren't funny and then a chick calls you out on it, 
[00:32:30]  you really have no right to go up to her, yell at her face, and kick her out of a comedy  club.  That seems a little petty.  If she was just there and out of nowhere said, oh, and started tweeting, I'm watching Dane  Cook.  He sucks.  You know, it's kind of a return volley.  And he got a little pissy about it, but, you know, I just found it very funny because  that's like the second or third instance that Twitter has gotten her in a jam up.  It's pretty goddamn funny. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, that makes sense.  I mean, if someone says to you, what do you think of women comics?  And you respond, I don't think they're funny.  That's totally different than just coming out and going, hey, I don't like.  Right, right.  Well, he should be able to say that without a problem.  What was his actual tweet?  Chicks aren't funny.  He just wrote that out of the blue?  I guess.  I don't know.  He might have deleted it.  And there was nothing behind it?  Maybe he deleted it.  I got, he says, women aren't good at vine.  Girls suck at vine, he wrote. 
[00:33:30]  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if that was the one, but I don't see women aren't funny.  Chicks aren't funny or something.  Most people suck at vine.  Yeah, some guys do.  Some of us are good at it.  Well, let me tell you, Chippa is made for vine.  Well, I can't disagree with you.  Six second laps.  The fucking one.  What's you?  Chipp is in the cab talking about the movie.  That one is great.  Can we play some?  A film in a movie?  That was a good question.  A movie?  What's in a movie? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, I hated age progressive time you said movie.  He's also trying to figure out why they chose the name vine.  That was clever.  I liked that one, too.  I went clever.  Oh, God.  The name of the movie?  Who's starring in this movie?  Hey, can I be in a movie?  Are you guys making a movie?  The name of the movie?  Who's starring in this movie?  Hey, can I be in a movie?  Are you guys making a movie? 
[00:34:30]  The name of the movie?  Who's starring in this movie?  Hey, can I be in a movie?  And the camera's all fucked up.  We gotta stare into your nostrils.  Oh, that is a great fucking vine.  I was cracking up at that one.  Does it hang from a tree?  Does Tarzan use it, or does it hang from a tree?  Why do they call it vine?  Does it hang from a tree?  Does Tarzan use it, or does it hang from a tree?  Why do they call it vine? 
[00:35:00]  Does it hang from a tree?  Does Tarzan use it, or does it hang from a tree?  Why do they call it vine?  Does it hang from a tree?  Does Tarzan use it, or does it hang from a tree?  Fucking clever, right?  He's very clever.  No question.  Did the cab driver, was he looking at you?  Probably probably recognize me.  Oh, he recognized you.  Hey, homeboys, take your guns and go like that with him,  and then take your phones and go like that so we can see everything better. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, homeboys, take your guns and go like that with him,  and then take your phones and go like that so we can see everything better.  Oh.  You know what's embarrassing is there's people who follow me on Twitter  who don't know the show.  Oh, no.  Like a couple of women I know.  And, uh...  What do you...  What is that?  Just, yeah, why do you talk like that?  Like, eh, it's a character.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  But they're disturbed by it?  No, they don't...  They just don't understand it.  I don't know why you're doing that. 
[00:36:00]  Because they know how I talk.  It's pretty easy to understand, don't you think?  But they don't understand, like, the bad joke behind it.  Like, we're all right.  Right.  They don't get it.  And they're not wrong.  Oh.  Great.  Now they keep showing that stroller on the tracks.  Yeah, that'll be the video of the day, right?  That's the big video of the day, yeah.  That's their big video.  What was their mom doing that she just left the stroller?  And then you see the other stroller rolling toward the tracks?  Fuck it.  They turn their backs on a stroller.  Then someone else is trying to help, and their stroller's starting to, you know, head toward the tracks. 
[00:36:30]  What's wrong with that platform, like, graded toward the tracks?  No kidding.  That doesn't seem like a good design.  No.  We got the O.J.  On the stand yesterday.  O.J. took the stand.  Got a little emotional, I hear.  Yeah, he didn't talk back in, what was it, 2008?  No, he didn't talk at his murder trial.  He didn't talk at his original armed robbery trial.  I think they got enough to give him another trial.  I'm starting to think. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  I know you strongly suggest that it's not going to happen, but...  Yeah.  Because now it's coming out, he was pretty fucked up that day, but that never came out in the original trial.  What?  That's an excuse?  If you get fucked up, you can...  Well, it wasn't brought up, though.  You know, it wasn't even brought up in the trial, is the point, I guess.  I don't want people to get a bad impression of me.  Showing that...  Like I drink.  Showing that his lawyer might not have been on top of the whole thing.  Ah, that's good. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Here's the O.J. talking yesterday on the stand.  How often did you see him in person during the time that you...  Yeah, they're talking about O.J.'s attorney, because it's all about O.J.'s attorney.  You know, O.J. doesn't feel like he was represented properly.  No.  ...working on the case anymore?  Not that often.  From time to time, things in the tabloids would come up.  And, uh, Yale had a relationship with people in the media, and he would go on various shows 
[00:38:00]  at times to, uh, uh, you know, refute, uh, many of the tabloid stories.  I'm in prison.  Okay.  Did you retain him for those purposes?  No.  All right.  Yale, Yale, uh, I guess he sort of liked doing it, and he told me he did.  Sometimes he was on shows I didn't even know he was on.  Uh, but as I said, he had, he had a good relationship with the media, and consequently, uh, I was 
[00:38:30]  in the media a lot, so they gave him balance.  They didn't even go on TV.  O.J. loves to laugh.  He's charming.  O.J. loves a good laugh.  Oh, you know, I was in the media.  Oh, yeah.  We all know.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  You know, from when I killed my wife.  Yeah, yeah, right.  If you remember, back in the 90s, I had murdered two people.  Brutally.  I was in the media a lot, as murderers tend to be.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. 
[00:39:00]  Just laughing his way through life.  Oh, yeah.  What a great way to go through life.  Just oblivious.  Yeah.  Everybody loves O.J.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Everyone.  So now the old lady in the airport yelled,  Go, O.J., go.  She loved me.  Everybody loved O.J.  O.J. talks about finding out about his stuff  and that it was in Vegas there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So tell me about what happened  with the changing of the plan 
[00:39:30]  or the evolving plan.  I was going to kill the other thing.  The other plan.  Oh, you almost got me, darling,  on that one.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  You almost tripped me up.  You quick.  You quick.  You quick.  You quick.  I believe it was the Saturday,  Friday or Saturday before I came to Vegas,  which was the following Wednesday, I think,  Tuesday or Wednesday.  I get a call from O.J.  I get a call from Riccio and he's in a panic. 
[00:40:00]  He's telling me, O.J., they're selling your stuff.  I mean, here's your mother's stuff, your baby's stuff.  This stuff, man, I can't believe you don't want this stuff.  They're selling it.  He was in New York, so I'm assuming they were selling it in New York.  I said, well, I got mad at him and said, man, I ain't coming to New York.  So, I mean, there's nothing I can do about it if they've done that.  I'm not getting on a plane coming to New York.  He said, well, man, I cannot believe that, you know.  I said, man, yes, I would love to have it. 
[00:40:30]  I said, look.  I would love to.  If whatever they have in Soho, you can get next week.  I got to go to Las Vegas for a wedding.  I'll fly to L.A. from Las Vegas.  So try to get whatever's left, you know, next week.  And he said, you coming to Vegas?  You going to Vegas?  And I said, yes.  He said, let me call you back.  They're in Vegas.  Shortly, he called me back and said, this stuff is in Vegas.  And he said, would you want to do it in Vegas? 
[00:41:00]  And I said, yeah.  Holy shit.  I'll say, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it's creepy how he just laughs through it.  I was chipping golf balls.  And then I cut myself on a broken ass tree.  OJ's luck.  Oh, you know, if it was in New York, this never would have happened.  I was going to Vegas for a wedding.  Man, if I didn't have good luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all.  Oh, man.  A wedding, armed robbery, whatever. 
[00:41:30]  Down for whatever.  That's why they call me the juice.  I'm the juice.  I go with the flow.  Okay.  And so with respect to the phone calls, what kind of advice was Mr. Glant for giving?  Well, the overall advice he gave me was, is you have a right to get your stuff.  He gave me an example that if you were walking down the street and you saw your laptop with 
[00:42:00]  your name on it, in a car, you can use a force to break the window of the car to get the laptop.  I noticed.  He told me on, uh, not only then, but even the night before.  I don't think that's true.  Wait, wait, wait.  His lawyer's basically saying you can do that to get your laptop back?  I don't think that's, uh...  And if somebody's with your wife, you can kill them.  You can...  My lawyer told me that if a Ron Goldman is with your wife, you can slit their throats over.  Uh, if you're driving a car with your name on the registration... 
[00:42:30]  That's your car.  It's your car.  You actually are obligated to murder the people.  No problem.  Uh, I don't think if you see a laptop, um, in a car with your name on it...  You're allowed to just forcibly...  You can just break the window and take it.  Break the window and grab your laptop back?  I don't think so.  I don't think certain things for property...  I know for, like, um, to protect life and limb...  Right.  You can, you know, do some things where normally it would be considered maybe breaking and entering or something. 
[00:43:00]  But, um, for property, I don't think you could do that.  You could call the police.  I think you, uh, just call the police.  Uh, yeah.  I think you're right.  Your Honor, how was I to know that the driver of the car was also named O.J.?  O.J., yeah.  He had my name on it.  My name.  Where's this lawyer?  This bumbling lawyer?  I don't know.  Is he gonna talk in this case?  Uh...  He's still alive, right?  He would, I guess he...  I'm sure they'll call him.  He would have to testify. 
[00:43:30]  Probably.  Yeah.  He told me on, uh, not only then, but even the night before, uh, that I couldn't go in a person's dwelling.  Because that would be trespassing.  Excuse me, Your Honor, at this juncture, Mr. Simpson is talking about a specific occasion, September 12th of 2013, which was, as Mr. Simpson would say, the night before.  I would request that they state when and where this discussion took place and who was present. 
[00:44:00]  That's just hearsay.  You keep your suggestions to yourself.  O.J.'s talking.  O.J.'s talking.  I'm just, okay, whatever.  All right.  You know, I know you objected.  They say sustained.  I understand.  I give you the date.  I give you the date.  All right.  Can I go home now?  Oh, wait.  I gotta go back to prison?  Yeah, he thinks it's his coming out party. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Would you mind real quick uncuffing my other hand?  Yes.  I have to hold the thing down when I sign it.  He's just waiting for the party to begin.  Yeah.  Any moment they're going to come in with balloons and...  Oh, life's a party, O.J.  The dream team will be back defending them.  When the marshal put him in the seat, he was kind of like laughing with him.  Like, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  He's going to wake up in bed and fucking it'll be black and white and Johnny Cochran will 
[00:45:00]  be next to him and the rest of the dream team.  And you were there.  And you.  And you.  Oh, I had a horrible dream.  See, I was running a football right to it.  Come on.  O.J. talks about celebrating and drinking before getting his stuff back.  He had a big day of partying before they committed the crime.  The Jews had to celebrate.  That's right.  The night of September 12th, during that dinner, were you drinking alcohol?  Yes.  And did you go out and stay out after that dinner? 
[00:45:30]  Well, yeah, I was out.  When I say out, I don't know if I left the hotel, but there are a number of clubs and bars  in the hotel.  Okay.  Did you become intoxicated at any point during that night?  I will have it.  Or the evening?  You know, it's, I wouldn't have gotten behind the wheel of a car.  Okay.  I'll rob a motherfucker.  I'm in Las Vegas.  I'm in Las Vegas with a lot of friends and I was meeting some relatives.  I called Al Cowlings to drive me. 
[00:46:00]  Al's a good driver.  He drove me once before.  What do you expect?  I'm in Las Vegas.  Of course I'm going to celebrate.  Plus, I got away with murder.  Yeah.  You think Ron Goldman is happy today?  Hearing about OJ and his celebrations in Vegas?  Fred Goldman?  I mean, Fred.  Oh, Ron Goldman.  Oh, man.  Oh, would you be great at that?  That'd be fun.  Fucking Sam on Radio Through History.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  Ah, the Lindbergh baby.  No, it's Charles Lindbergh. 
[00:46:30]  Charles.  It's called the Lindbergh baby.  Missing baby.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Vegas.  I mean, Las Vegas with a lot of friends and I was meeting some relatives of Tom's and,  yeah, we were in a very celebrative mood.  Celebrative.  Okay.  Did you stay out late or get to bed early or what'd you do?  We stayed out.  I guess it was late.  So, the next morning on the 13th, did you have any trouble getting up?  I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't get up to go. 
[00:47:00]  I had a golf game schedule.  Of course.  He loves golf.  Couldn't get up for us.  So, I want to talk to you about your activities on the 13th.  What did you do after you got up?  What time did you get up to your nose?  I, I think it was rather late and I didn't, I stayed in the room and, you know, just didn't  feel like getting up and I kind of waited around for a while.  Oh, okay.  And I think about midday or so I went down and had a late breakfast.  Did you have any alcohol with your breakfast? 
[00:47:30]  I think I had a Bloody Mary or two.  A Bloody Mary or two.  A Bloody Mary or two.  A Bloody Mary, Jesus.  He drank the night before.  He was too hungover to get up, right?  Yeah.  So, then he finally gets up around noon-ish or whatever and, and then has breakfast, but  he's got to suck down that Bloody Mary.  A Bloody Mary or two.  It is Vegas, though.  But see, the cluelessness of OJ, his favorite drink in the, a Bloody Mary?  I had a Bloody Nicole, I mean Mary.  I had a Bloody Mary, of course.  Yes.  Wouldn't you avoid the Bloody Mary if you got away with double homicide? 
[00:48:00]  Exactly.  I had a Bloody murder.  Oops, it's a Freudian slip.  Give me the mimosa instead.  Exactly.  Avoid bloody.  Yeah.  Avoid bloody.  At all costs.  Avoid everything.  You got away with double murder.  Oh, OJ.  Yeah, don't go to Vegas and stay up all night drinking and then drink all day.  Just stay home.  No, avoid Vegas, avoid ordering Bloody Mary's. 
[00:48:30]  Bloody Mary's, and then going out on an armed robbery ramp.  Romp.  Knowing what you got away with.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was drunk.  Is that ever a good excuse for a robbery?  Has that ever worked?  Like, in a fucking court of law that I was just a little too drunk to understand it was  wrong?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the point to try to make it was just never brought up originally, because it shows  his frame of mind.  I don't know if it's going to help him, but.  Yeah.  And he continued celebrating.  So, do you know what time you get to the pool?  About midday. 
[00:49:00]  I think 12 or 1, maybe.  Okay.  And at the pool, are you having any alcohol?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  And how much were you drinking, if you can remember?  Well, I, you know, I had a joke that my doctor says I should never have an empty glass, is  what I would tell the waitress.  That's a good one.  Kim and the doctor just joking around.  What'd the coroner tell you about the decapitated wife?  He's just the best.  I'm down by the pool. 
[00:49:30]  Well, I have a sex on the beach and a murder at my wife's house.  Yes, let me ask some of that.  Just kidding, just kidding.  Keep them coming, my doctor.  My doctor says.  Bloody Mary with some blonde hair mixing.  I'm just kidding.  I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a decapitated wife.  If you can look past the double murder, he's just the best.  Oh, he's charming.  He's hilarious.  He's just the greatest.  Imagine drinking poolside with the juice.  That would be fucking great.  Sure.  I had a joke.  Wait till you hear this one. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  My doctor.  You're going to love this one.  Never have an empty glass in front of you.  Never have an empty glass.  My doctor says I should never have an empty glass is what I would tell the waitress.  So we were celebrating.  It was all this celebrating.  Exactly.  Your wife's fucking head was cut off.  It's probably you.  By you.  Yeah.  Years and years later, I'm still celebrating that I didn't go to jail for murder.  Right.  I'd be celebrating like that too.  Think about it. 
[00:50:30]  That is true.  Every day you'd wake up.  Woohoo.  It's time to celebrate.  I have headphones on.  And I'd be like, what is Jim listening to?  That Kool and the Gang song again.  All he does.  And he was waiting for the laugh there.  He thought his joke was going to kill.  And then he goes, well, anyway.  Anyway.  Is that his lawyer?  Yeah.  It is.  Because she kind of laughed at it.  Yes.  It's his lawyer.  She kind of chuckled.  Oh, Jane.  We were celebrating.  It was, you know, we were all celebrating.  Okay. 
[00:51:00]  Do you recall a point in the poem's transcript where it says, I've had four already?  Yeah.  Did you think that was you that said that?  I know I had four.  Okay.  So, by the morning in the afternoon, you probably already had four?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  I'm counting the Bloody Marys at breakfast.  Yes.  Okay.  So, you're at the pool, and you're talking to people?  Yes.  Okay.  And are you telling everybody about the plan, as we heard yesterday? 
[00:51:30]  Well, I don't think I really started talking about that until Richie showed up.  Okay.  And once he showed up, everybody I introduced him to, I told them why he was there.  All right.  And that was not only family, wedding people.  It's like a bumbling crime comedy.  Strangers.  Starring the judge.  Virtually the waiter.  Virtually everybody, or the bartender, I should say.  Outside bartender.  Virtually everyone who was there. 
[00:52:00]  They all heard his plan?  Yes.  He was going around telling everyone.  Keep it on the QT.  Bartender, bartender.  Bartender, we're going to go rob these motherfuckers.  Remember how I got away with murder?  Waitress.  Towel boy.  The towel boy needs to know that I'm going to go in there armed and get my shit back.  Wait till you hear this one.  Yeah, yeah.  Come here.  Bring me another drink.  My glass is empty.  You know, did I tell you the one about my doctor?  Yeah, my wife's doctor told her to always keep her head on her shoulders, but she didn't 
[00:52:30]  listen.  We've got to get him out of prison.  The world needs O.J. Simpson.  Oh, yes.  Please.  We haven't heard him talk in years.  This is great.  Forget how funny he is.  We need him.  Barkeep, after all that murder bullshit, I'm about to go rob some people.  Rob people.  I'm improving.  Just amazing.  I could see in the bathroom.  There was a lot of stuff.  And then I could see the bed almost immediately.  And I turned to Cashmore in early and said, don't let anybody out of here. 
[00:53:00]  Oh.  And I walked in and I was kind of stunned because I was looking at stuff that I hadn't seen in,  you know, 10 years.  Your wife?  Yeah.  When you're saying that you've heard on the audio tape, you're saying repeatedly, don't  let anybody out of here.  Yes.  Why are you saying that?  Because these guys are in here with my stuff.  I don't want them to leave because if, you know, if they don't volunteer to me, I want  them to.  Huh?  Says O.J. Simpson cracking jokes during testimony. 
[00:53:30]  Squeezing out a few laughs is the headline.  I got a million of them.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to love this one.  My doctor.  By the way, is that really a defense, not knowing a gun?  The guy, what's his name?  The actor who's in jail because an undercover cop was murdered during that robbery.  Right.  He might not have known the other guy had a gun.  Too bad.  Right.  You're involved with a robbery and someone has a gun.  That's the price you pay.  Yeah.  I just think they give him a new trial.  I really don't.  I don't know.  You know, they got them for four years so far. 
[00:54:00]  Four or five years in the joint, right?  I don't want them to leave because, you know, if they don't volunteer to me, I want them arrested.  And, you know, when I say these guys, I wouldn't talk about those two guys.  I was a little concerned with, I didn't know Cashmore and I didn't really trust Walter.  Okay.  So, you're saying don't let anybody out here.  You're looking at your stuff.  Yeah, I'm looking and I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, it's, you know, I'm inhaling. 
[00:54:30]  You look at this stuff.  You know, some of this stuff I honestly didn't even know was gone.  I had forgotten about, you know.  So, you know, I.  Like what, for instance?  An All-American certificate.  And as far as I knew, it was, you know, I had it framed.  Bob Hope had given it to me, you know, for Kodak.  And I had presented one, as he said, to J. Edgar Hoover.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  I mean, these are things that, you know, if you live with them in your house on a wall, you forget them.  You don't see them.  It's wallpaper.  And these are things I hadn't seen in 10 years.  And I was a little emotional about it.  Okay.  Yeah, I mean.  I was emotional about that.  Yeah, but you do see someone with your shit.  Sure.  What the fuck, Jimmy?  You'd be out of your mind if you went somewhere and saw somebody had your shit.  I would be.  However, if instead of being there, I should be in jail for almost cutting my wife's head off, I'd probably handle it better. 
[00:55:30]  And he got emotional on the stand talking about his stuff.  Right.  We never saw him get emotional in his murder trial about his dead, fucking, almost decapitated wife.  Right.  But I get a little choked up about this.  My certificate.  Hey, Juice, here's my certificate I got you, you murderer.  I got to tell you.  Bob Hope gave me that.  Poor OJ.  Does he talk more today? 
[00:56:00]  Or is this it?  No, I think he does because he hasn't been cross-examined.  Oh, nice.  Oh, boy.  That should be good.  Yeah.  Conflict.  That should be fun.  Yeah, the other lawyer was piping up the whole time he was talking, you know, like he was in that one clip.  Yeah, yeah.  He was doing it the whole time.  Well, aren't conversations that aren't recorded all hearsay?  Like, if I say that, you know, you and I had a talk, it's all hearsay.  You can't prove that.  Right.  I mean, I think first person, they take that a little more to heart than when you're, and if you can get a corroboration witness.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  All right, we should break because we got Penn Jillette on his way up.  Oh.  I got a good joke, though.  He should have said something like, hey, what do you want me to do?  Like, go score a bunch of touchdowns or something?  I'm having a...  The OPN Anthony Show.  Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, serious XM.  The OPN Anthony Channel.  What's that?  On Sirius XM.  The Pepe Sinclair News Company presents Personal Hygiene and You, A Beginner's Guide. 
[00:57:00]  You know, as we move into the future, personal hygiene is becoming more and more important to our daily lives.  Why, look, there is Hollywood celebrity Jim Norton.  Mr. Norton, what is the most important part of your daily hygiene regimen?  I like my own asshole to sparkle.  And sparkle it does.  How do you achieve such a sparkle, Mr. Norton?  This is how I wipe my ass.  Here's the toilet.  I put one foot up and I go like this and I march my asshole out.  And I fucking open the cheeks and I make sure that I get in there.  I put a finger all the way up in until it's fucking completely clean.  Even on those extra messy days? 
[00:57:30]  If it looks like there's still more work to be done, then I'll take a wet wipe or whatever.  And I'll wrap it around my finger and push it almost up.  You never know when a massage therapist might have to get in there, you know?  Why, here comes Teddy, the neighborhood scamp.  Hi, Teddy.  Do you clean your rectum?  Every day.  Why don't you show Jim how you do it?  Wait, you just, you just, you don't go in?  No, Mr. Norton.  I just wipe it like I thought I was supposed to.  Oh, no.  I gotta get in there because I like my asshole to feel clean. 
[00:58:00]  When I was a kid, I didn't wipe good enough.  My asshole would get raw.  So I've learned.  Oh, I get it.  Thanks, Mr. Norton.  Ha ha.  You're welcome, Teddy.  We've all learned a little something today.  I like a nice, clean ass.  Makes me feel like a better person.  We couldn't agree more.  Tune in to our next personal hygiene lesson when we'll go over the schmegma removal process.  And remember, clean assholes for a better tomorrow.  You guys are back from the toilet. 
[00:58:30]  Now, back to our show.  Beach Boys released Pet Sounds 47 years ago today. 
[00:59:00]  That's not very important right now because we've got Penn Jillette outside the studio.  And Roland just handed us ice cream.  Yeah.  I normally wouldn't eat ice cream this early in the morning, but I'm going to have a couple of bites.  Hi, Penn.  How you doing, my friend?  Good to see some friendly things.  Absolutely.  What's up, Penn?  I'm going to try out some of this ice cream here.  You better.  The ice cream looks all right, brother.  It's really good.  It's really good.  Look at the packaging.  My God. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Will this actually be in stores?  What do you mean, will it be?  It's in stores now.  Oh, sorry.  Penn, you know, we've already bought several cartons.  That's what we're supposed to say.  This is so creamy and delicious.  It's creamy and good, and it's mine.  Oh, look at the chocolate in here.  Oh, my God.  I'll have a couple of bites.  I've been on a good diet, but I have to try it.  It would be in polite.  Oh, my God.  Ice cream is so good.  I'm going to have such gassers on the plane today, too, because lactose does that to me. 
[01:00:00]  That's my main motivation of trying some ice cream.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy goes, yeah.  What's the story behind the ice cream there?  Well, you know, I'm on this television program called Celebrity Apprentice.  Yes, we do know that.  And the final task.  I'm a finalist.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  And last time I was here, I was already a finalist, but I kept it from you.  I know you did.  I did.  I kept it from you.  We tried to get it out of you, too.  I know.  I know.  But you knew in your heart.  Yeah, we did.  You're like Nixon.  You know in your heart he's right. 
[01:00:30]  How good is the ice cream?  Oh, my God.  So we had a design for Walgreens, or as it is in New York, Duane Reade.  We had a design in ice cream.  And Trace went with Carpet Fibers and Shit as his flavor.  And I went with this rich vanilla ice cream with sea salt chocolate and fudge caramel candy pieces.  It's all about the sea salt, sir.  This is amazing.  Yes, it is.  And that's my idea.  Sea salt has taken over the world.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  You just won. 
[01:01:00]  I just nailed it.  I think I did, yeah.  Right when you said that, I got a taste of the chocolate with the sea salt.  Who would think that would be good with ice cream?  It is.  Penn Jillette.  Exactly.  Celebrity apprentice.  That's the answer.  You're also a magician with ice cream, my friend.  And it's $100,000 to whoever sells the most ice cream to our charities.  I thought per carton.  Yeah.  And it would be a bargain at that, wouldn't it?  Wait, I got to ask one question before I endorse your ice cream.  Does the other guy have peanut butter in his ice cream?  No.  Oh, I hate peanut butter. 
[01:01:30]  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  He has macadamia maple.  Ew.  No, that's terrible.  That's a good reaction.  That is it.  That is it.  This is all American.  See, when I said Carpet Fibers and Shit, you went, yeah.  When I say macadamia maple, my charity is a charity, Opportunity Village in Vegas.  It's kind of a David and Goliath thing, because he's got, I was hoping he would go for American  Nazi Party.  Right.  But instead, he went for Red Cross.  Oh, okay.  Which is a fine charity.  But, you know, $100,000 to a local charity in Vegas that helps people with intellectual 
[01:02:00]  disabilities get jobs is huge.  You know, $100,000 for the Red Cross.  It's like, ah, fuck you.  $100,000.  Yeah, yeah.  We got that up our ass.  So, you know, I'm hoping.  And I've been eating this ice cream, you know, because I go on shows.  Yeah.  You know, and I eat the ice cream for show, but I still end up eating it.  I love it.  It's so good.  And I mean this very sincerely.  That might be the best ice cream I've ever eaten.  I'm not being polite, because you're here.  Well, thank you.  That is fucking amazing. 
[01:02:30]  Did you actually come up with this?  Yes.  You're a winner.  That's the nutty thing about Celebrity Apprentice.  Because I don't know what's real with that shit.  Well, no.  Most of Celebrity Apprentice is just real.  They don't read stuff behind the camera.  They don't do retakes.  All that stuff I've done on every other show, they don't do.  Is there a way I could bet on the winner?  Because you got this.  Okay, well, good.  You know, I hope so.  I hope so.  Hold on.  I had a second question.  So you came up with this, right?  Yeah.  It's an amazing flavor.  Jimmy's saying it's the best ice cream I've ever eaten.  I mean it.  I can't stop.  Does freaking Donald Trump own this ice cream now, or do you got a piece of the action? 
[01:03:00]  I have a piece of the action after a year.  Oh!  No one's going to care in a year.  Wait, don't say that.  Please, don't say that.  There's going to be another ice cream in a year.  You just throw me away.  Discard me like you're cum-filled socks in the bottom of the bed, don't you?  I'm looking out for you.  Oh, that Donald Trump is tough, is what I'm getting at.  You come up with this amazing flavor, and you don't get the action until a year from  now.  This has longevity. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, people will come back to this.  You think it has longevity.  Plus, Penn's famous enough to go out and promote it yourself after.  It's like...  You are famous, Penn.  Well, thank you.  You're very famous.  You look thinner, too.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinner and famous.  They go together.  Look at Angelina Jolie.  And, yeah, so I'm a finalist.  I'm a finalist on the show.  Congrats.  You got this.  It's me and Trace.  We don't know.  I think it should be very, very close.  But the funny thing is, every other year, most of the years, they've had real animosity 
[01:04:00]  with the two finalists.  Right.  And Trace and I get along great.  You get along, yeah.  Yeah.  Get along wonderfully.  Because, you know, why would there be animosity on a television show?  But there sometimes is.  Yeah, well, people get very competitive.  Sometimes they make drama.  We're doing the best we can.  I think sometimes they make drama, you know?  You guys get along, though?  Mm-hmm.  Very well.  You performers.  Yeah.  This ice cream is ridiculous.  Fucking...  I gave mine to Sam.  I ate, like, fucking five bites and...  It's crazy.  You're not going to get mad if I throw this away, because I can't eat this whole fucking 
[01:04:30]  thing.  Give it to, like, Roland.  It's too good.  Give it Roland a little bit.  It's so goddamn good.  Look at this.  Wow.  And it's only until Saturday that it counts.  I've gotten to the soul part.  You know, there's a bunch of...  Every Walgreens, every Duane Reade has it.  I suggest very strongly you not even try his flavor.  Yeah.  And if you try his flavor, it doesn't help me at all.  Let me tell you something.  Don't try his flavor, because the guy hasn't come on our show.  He doesn't come on your show?  No.  It's all about Penn Jillette.  Good.  Don't even try the other flavor.  Just buy Penn's ice cream. 
[01:05:00]  That's like a macadamia maple.  You like it?  Maple.  It sounds terrible.  Yeah, well, I don't care for it, but some people do.  Maple's only good on pancakes.  That's a niche.  That's it.  That's a niche flavor.  This is a flavor for the people.  This is universal.  This is the people's flavor.  You got your vanilla and your chocolate right in there.  It's all American.  You are...  Dude, that's so goddamn good.  I'm tempted to just keep eating this.  I never really eat ice cream.  I'm sea-salting my ass off right now.  Look at that shit.  All right.  One more big fucking spoonful. 
[01:05:30]  How does he compete?  That other one sounds awful.  Yeah, well, you know, it would be nice to win.  If I do not win, if I do not bring home the bacon for O&A, will you still love me?  Yes.  I'll like you more if you lose, because I'll relate to you.  Oh, by the way, on Penn Sunday School, for those who listen, this Sunday is Jim's show.  Oh, good, good, good, man.  Because I'll be here doing Celebrity Apprentice.  We're rolling that in now.  So you'll be on.  That was a really good show. 
[01:06:00]  I understand why you have him on here.  Yes.  He's good all the time.  Thank you.  You finally have an understanding why we have this guy on here.  Sam, you're enjoying your ice cream?  It's delicious.  When is the finale for Celebrity Apprentice?  This weekend?  Sunday, yeah.  Okay, so we're right there now.  And that's live?  Yeah.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  Well, they do a two-hour show.  They roll in about an hour.  And then we come out, and they try to get us to, I guess, arm wrestlers.  How hard is it not to tell people you're a finalist? 
[01:06:30]  You know, um...  You had to keep that quiet for how long now?  Four or five months?  What if my skill set of keeping secrets is there?  What if my skill set of keeping secrets is there?  That is true.  Oh, fuck me, man.  You know, I could also, I could deliberately mislead you if I want.  I didn't even have to do that.  Which is like, you know...  Which you did.  And the NBC says to me, you know, this is very important that you keep...  I go, yeah, we catch bullets in our teeth.  I can...  I think I can handle this.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  I talk an awful lot, but you'd be surprised at how much I'm shutting up.  I don't give you the hints when I'm not supposed to.  You know, I thought of you.  I did a show on TV.  I was doing Red Eye, and we were joking about Sylvia Brown and how she was wrong.  And the word fraud came up, and I said, no, no, no.  I said, I'm not saying she's a fraud.  Oh, that's right.  I'm just saying it.  I refuse to...  We learned that from Penn last time.  No reason to go down to Chinatown for that.  No.  That is not a hill that Jim Norton needs to die on.  Absolutely not. 
[01:07:30]  I'll bash her.  I'll make fun of her.  But there's a big difference between...  Don't call her a fraud, though.  You can't call any of them a fraudulent.  What's your thoughts on Sylvia Brown?  I mean, it's just...  When you think about the sadness, you know, this is the answer to what harm does it do.  Well, there's a lot of harm.  Right, right.  A woman died not knowing, you know...  That her daughter was still alive, right?  And for the people that don't know, sorry, Sylvia Brown went on, Montel Williams, was it?  And told the mom that the daughter was dead.  I don't know what show is on yet.  Yeah.  And it's just heartbreaking. 
[01:08:00]  You know, and that's just...  That's not the people who, you know, lose money and all of that.  But I always say that that pain is nothing compared to, you know, my mom and dad are both dead.  And my sister.  And all I have...  And one of my most precious possessions is my memory of my mom.  And I have what she said in my head.  And I have the conversations that we had.  And people who are grief-stricken, as, you know, as I certainly was when my parents died. 
[01:08:30]  If I had gone to a psychic and that dipshit had said, we're getting these words from beyond,  they would be throwing out the real memories that I have and giving me memories of fucking Sylvia Brown doing bad improv.  Some of their shit, right.  Yeah.  You know, right.  Give me a place a person could be, okay, dead.  Yeah, yeah.  And who that person could be, okay, your mother.  Right, right.  Okay, here's what she's thinking.  Can I give you my sister's phone number? 
[01:09:00]  And could you call her and talk to her for five minutes?  She believes in that Long Island medium lady.  That's really so sad.  I'm like, hi.  Yeah, that woman is all over.  Speaking of what, your sister.  Your sister came to our show.  Yes, she loves you.  Oh, in Vegas?  Yeah, Dawn came.  And, oh, she loved the show.  She just fucking can't say enough about it.  You know, really, really not hard to believe she's your sister.  Why, do they have to carry her out drunk?  I didn't have to ask for any ID whatsoever. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She said it.  It just, you know, there's a family resemblance.  Yeah.  There's a style.  Dawn rules.  She was great.  She had such a great time.  She was thrilled to death to meet you.  It was great.  And people were thrilled she was in the audience.  Because she came up, you know, after the show, and announced pretty clearly who she was.  She's hilarious.  And people around were like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  What a yap on her.  That's great, you know.  She was posing for pictures of us together. 
[01:10:00]  But then also for other people.  Oh, that's hilarious.  She's a person.  She had such a great time, though.  Yes.  She loves your show.  Yeah.  We had a wonderful time.  We didn't know she was there.  You should have let us know.  We would have set you up and stuff.  And she just came like a regular punter.  Yeah.  Like a regular person.  Yeah.  We didn't give her fancy, fancy O&A nepotism seats.  We have the O&A nepotism section.  But that was empty that night.  And there she was. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  It's a great show, man.  It's just, what a blast.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  It's great.  You know, we're doing, I've got to tell you, Celebrity Apprentice sure moves tickets.  I mean, we're filled up all the time now.  It opens you up to people that probably normally wouldn't do it.  It's amazing, you know, and forgive me if this sounds unpleasant, but I thought that there  were a lot of people who didn't like Penn & Teller, but I didn't know there were that  many people who had never heard of Penn & Teller. 
[01:11:00]  No idea.  People that come to the show and go, I never heard of you guys until Celebrity Apprentice.  I've been around for how long?  That's unbelievable.  And you just, you know, and I say, well, yeah, and they love the show.  And now they're new fans, and now I say, well, in terms of economics, the people you  want coming to your show are people that have never heard of you before, because then  you're starting a whole new market.  But I just go, man, I thought you all made your decision on us about 93.  Right, right.  About 93 you decided, they suck, or I like them, the battle lines were drawn, and you 
[01:11:30]  moved on through your life, you know?  Yeah, who are these, I don't even know who they are, Penn & Teller, right?  No clue, no clue.  And really, they would come, and after the show, they'd go, I didn't know you did a  magic show.  Oh, my God.  I saw you at Celebrity Apprentice, and we just did one of the Indian casinos somewhere,  you know, Biloxi or something, you know?  Yeah.  And this guy comes up to me, I'm on my way to the steakhouse before the show, and he  says to me, watch you at Celebrity Apprentice, no idea what you do, but I'm coming to see 
[01:12:00]  you tonight.  Wow.  Wow.  I mean, now that's a great deal of support.  Yeah.  That's really great.  And I just kind of go, wow, no idea what I do.  Boy, that's kind of a kick in the ass.  Kind of like, shit.  Saturday Night Live, Letterman, you know, bullshit, all those things just blew right by.  There's a certain segment of the population that doesn't know, you know?  And I was talking to Bob Dylan's manager, who said, you think you're surprised. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, wow.  No.  All right.  No fucking way.  And I said, no fucking way.  No fucking way.  Occasionally I'm on the phone, and I'll say I work with Bob Dylan, and they'll go, who?  No.  Come on.  And I went, okay, I'm fine with this then.  Now you're fine.  Wow.  And then he started listing things.  He said, Fargo.  Everybody you know saw Fargo, right?  Yeah.  I go, yeah.  He goes, not a very successful movie.  Goodfellas.  Everybody you know saw Goodfellas, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people haven't heard of it. 
[01:13:00]  He said, just, you know, Elvis used to go crazy.  Who?  That there were aboriginal people in New Guinea that had not heard of him, you know?  And I get over that long ago.  I realized that out of the 7 billion people on the planet, 7 billion haven't heard of Ben  Eddler.  You know, if you round it off, 7 billion.  I kind of thought this small little chunk of the world, this, you know, 350 to 400 million, 
[01:13:30]  this tiny little drop of humanity, who uses the most resources, tiny little drop of humanity  had kind of, and I'm not saying beloved, and I'm not saying no well.  I'm just saying, oh, Penn and Teller, nah.  You know, that's all I'm requiring out of you.  Penn and Teller, nah.  You know, that's just, yeah.  I know that I exist.  But just those two words, together with an ampersand between them, mean nothing. 
[01:14:00]  Nothing.  You know, hegemony.  It's the same exact thing.  I don't know what that word means.  Don't know what Penn and Teller means.  Boom.  No idea.  And I do want to say, because this is something I, is that my charity, Opportunity Village,  which is what you'll be buying the ice cream for at Walgreens, Dwayne Reed, it was Elvis'  favorite charity.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know the scarves that Elvis used to take off his neck and wipe his ground and kiss  and throw it on?  Every single one of those was made at Opportunity Village. 
[01:14:30]  Opportunity Village, you know, people with intellectual disabilities, gives them jobs, helps them get  jobs in the community.  But they also had a workshop that just made Elvis' scarves.  Jeez.  So, as I said to Mr. Trump, and I will say again on the finale, I said, you know, if you're  not for me, you're against my charity.  And if you're against my charity, you're against Elvis.  And if you're against Elvis, sir, fuck you.  I mean, what else could he say?  Yeah, he used to, every one of the scarves that he would take.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:15:00]  And I have one of the scarves.  One of the real Elvis ones.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  The guy would put, who is that, would put it on his back?  Elvis would throw one out, and then someone would drape one on his back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Put a new one on.  I forget the guy's name.  The women would go wild.  With the Beatles, you know everybody in the band, George Martin, everything.  With Elvis, there's just Elvis.  Just Elvis.  Maybe Scotty Moore.  Maybe you know the guitar player.  But if you say to somebody, you know, who's Elvis' favorite drummer?  No idea.  So the guy that put the scarves on, not a chance.  Yeah, he's way out of the mix.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  I met his best friend at Dyson's wedding, Jerry.  Okay, I'm getting close to you there.  Yeah, Jerry.  Because you've got that Elvis connection.  A little bit.  The brother of the guy who put the scarves on Elvis.  I don't know what he did.  Jerry something.  I don't know what it is.  But he's saying he was best friends with Elvis.  No, he's doing all the same thing if he was alive.  Yeah, he's in all the fucking Elvis videos.  I know.  I keep dipping into the damn ice cream.  I'm actually staring at Penn's ice cream like it's tits.  Because I don't want to throw it away in front of him.  That's not the reason.  You're actually enjoying it, aren't you?  I already said I'm enjoying it, but I'm enjoying it so much I don't want to eat the whole damn thing. 
[01:16:00]  I just gave mine to fucking Sam.  I'd save it for later, but it's going to melt all over the place.  I would never have thought that's sea salt.  You taste it in the chocolate.  Sea salt.  Oh, there's a little salt in there.  It's good ice cream.  We get the dark chocolate with sea salt at home.  We got to go into a lab.  It was like a food lab.  And I'm thinking, they're putting us in the coats and shit.  I'm thinking, yeah, this is wanky. 
[01:16:30]  This is just your fucking TV.  And then you go in there, and there's actually a person whose life is making ice cream.  And they get all this stuff, and she goes, well, what do you like?  And I started telling her, you know, I was doing like a turtle-type thing, some sea salt,  some chocolate.  And she said, can't use the word turtle.  It's trademark.  Because I thought I would have turtle ice cream.  It's called Swirtle.  I would get turtle ice cream, and then I would get Howard Kalin and Mark Vollman, who are friends  of mine, the turtles, to play at the final party.  Oh, wow.  Turtle ice cream. 
[01:17:00]  They said, oh, no, no.  Turtles with ice cream.  Other people own that.  That's copyright problems.  They do, huh?  So we went with Swirtle.  I like Swirtle.  It's kind of catchy.  It's very catchy.  It's got the swirl of chocolate in there.  Hey, did you ever think you would see someone you knew on the carton of a dairy product gym  that wasn't locked in your closet?  No, not at all.  Exactly.  I've got quite a few of the milk cartons autographed.  Magic Swirtle.  There it is. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And a picture of me.  Yes.  You know?  A picture of me on an ice cream.  You can stare at that while you spoon out the ice cream.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a treat for the talent in the eyes.  Let your mind go wild as you eat the ice cream.  So what happens?  You go through the process of trying it, and you take a bite, and then they call you back  in an hour, and they go, all right, we've done this.  No, no.  They have this monster instant freeze machine.  Wow.  And you kind of go, the vanilla's a little cloying.  And they go, okay, let's pull it back a little bit. 
[01:18:00]  And they go, and you go, and Dennis Rodman has this incredibly sophisticated ice cream  palate.  So Dennis Rodman's sitting there going, a little bit more salt.  Really?  And she goes, okay.  And you go, wow.  Because I was satisfied with the ice cream, like three steps before Dennis was.  Right, right.  You know?  And so Dennis is just tasting, tasting, tasting, and then Dennis goes, it's perfect. 
[01:18:30]  Like, okay, Dennis, go get dressed for the party.  You just brought him along, or he was on your team?  He was on my team.  So we had, I had Dennis, LaToya, and Lisa Rinna were my team.  And we put it together.  How's LaToya?  Is she nuts?  You know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,  I know, that's why I'm asking you.  It's surprising.  Because we all think, people that have met her say that she's not nuts, but she certainly  portrays that she's nuts.  Because we, I didn't get to work with Dennis or with LaToya for the whole season. 
[01:19:00]  And then they threw them on my team at the end as kind of a change-up, you know, to  see how we do.  And LaToya, I was kind of hesitant because I had never worked with her.  So I thought that she was nuts.  And I thought she was really straightforward and kind of smart.  I don't mean, you know, smart like Richard Feynman's smart.  Like, I don't think, I don't think Stockholm is on the phone going, which Nobel do we give  her?  It's kind of tough.  It's either chemistry or medicine. 
[01:19:30]  She's got both in the bag.  We can't give her both.  Which do we do?  I don't think Stockholm's having any trouble with that.  Not that, no.  No.  But for show business, which, you know, is a whole, that's the special Olympics of intellect.  Who's she above in smarts?  Well, well, you know.  Who's just below her in smarts?  Just below her in smarts?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Probably Stephen Baldwin.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Very good answer, yeah.  That is a very good answer.  And, you know, I like them both.  And LaToya's great.  And then LaToya, you know, Teller comes in for the final task, and the cameras are all 
[01:20:00]  rolling, and LaToya's having this conversation with Teller, and Teller's looking at her and  smiling, and she takes about five minutes to realize that Teller doesn't talk.  And then we realize that LaToya Jackson has never heard of Ben and Teller.  Oh, no.  She is one of them.  That sucks.  Oh, man.  And so she learns that Teller doesn't talk, unlike Leon Russell.  You know, I was on Fallon with Leon Russell, who's a big hero of mine, you know, played with 
[01:20:30]  a wrecking crew on every single from like 61 to 64, the piano was Leon Russell.  Every single that comes out, you know, from Gary Lewis, you know, and the Playboys to  all that stuff is all Leon Russell.  And, of course, then the Joe Cocker, and then the stuff on his own.  And he's there in a wheelchair with a long beard and a long hair, and I walk up and I  go, Mr. Russell, so nice to meet you.  He goes, I don't suppose your partner's going to talk to me.  Oh, there you go. 
[01:21:00]  Wow.  Leon Russell knows.  Because I'm okay with that.  With people that, like, Leon Russell should never have heard of Penn and Teller.  He's got better things to do.  But Latoya Jackson, she's got five minutes.  Find out who better tell her.  But I had them on my team, and it was, you know, the surprising thing about Celebrity  Apprentice is, first of all, everybody else bitches about the hours, because you work from  like 5 a.m. to 10 p.m.  And that's like my usual work day, so I'm okay.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  But everybody else is like, whoa, that's long and tedious.  And it's also pretty fun, because you get to go into a lab and see how they make ice  cream, which I didn't know.  I know.  Like a lab, you just think, oh, you know, they bring in some milk and freeze it.  I think there's like a lab coat and people in a sterile environment doing testing.  And also, as you said, you think you leave for like two hours and come back.  You don't think they got magic cold machine to like a James Bond villain. 
[01:22:00]  You know, Batman, Mr. Freeze.  Oh, you want ice cream instantly?  Bang!  You would think the quality wouldn't be as good out of that instant, freeze-y thing.  Well, have you ever had liquid nitrogen ice cream?  No.  Oh, then you have not lived, sir.  Really?  Find yourself a supplier, because it's illegal.  Because, you know, when I do, a lot of people do illegal stuff, it's like drugs and hoops.  When I do illegal stuff, it involves sub-zero gases.  Right.  But you can get yourself, through a welding company and a little bribe on the side, you 
[01:22:30]  can get yourself a container of liquid nitrogen.  You know, they used to do it in the school shows.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They'd freeze a banana and smash it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then you just take a metal mixing bowl and you put in some cream, some sugar, you know,  some swirdle, put that into a bowl, just as soup, and then you take a doer, as it's  called in the chemistry biz.  See, Stockholm's got me on speed call.  And you pour it into there while you mix it.  Now, of course, if you spill too much on, you get frostbite and you, you know, die. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, true.  But, you know, that's why they try to keep it illegal.  Fucking pigs.  Just because it can really fuck you up making ice cream.  And then you stir it in, and really in, like, six seconds, it makes a whole batch of ice  cream.  And, of course, it's liquid nitrogen.  It goes right into the air.  It's gone.  There are no bubbles in it, no, nothing.  It's just this really smooth, beautiful ice cream made really, really wicked fast. 
[01:23:30]  Why isn't that supplied to the people, like, in stores?  Well, because, because making it with liquid nitrogen is really dangerous.  See, I'm suggesting when you do stuff that's dangerous, it's like heroin, which there's  a really strong upside to.  Right.  You know.  That is true.  The upside, the downside is you lose your hand.  The upside is the ice cream is terrific.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And risk-reward, it's not up there with heroin.  It's just not in the safe. 
[01:24:00]  The risk-reward with heroin is you've got some sores all over your body, and you feel  like you're coming 24 hours a day.  That's a good risk-reward, right?  A few sores on your body, I feel great.  But lose a hand, have a good thing of ice cream, you've got to be in that special pendulant  category.  This is pretty good, though.  I know.  This is really, really good.  No nitrogen used, but pretty goddamn good.  It's ridiculously good.  Yeah.  I know.  I keep digging in.  And you guys will be, I'm sure your listeners will run out and buy it.  And buy cases. 
[01:24:30]  And also, you know, hide traces, you know, over behind the rocky road or something.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't need that.  You don't need that at all.  Terrible flavor.  And then there's this wonderful chocolatey vanilla goodness.  Where do they go again?  Walgreens?  Well, Walgreens, which is Dwayne Reed.  Okay.  It's the whole thing.  But you're national.  You're bad.  You're nationwide.  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  It's Walgreens most of the place.  I love that song.  But I'm not even kidding.  People are asking me on Paltok here, they're like, is it really good, Anthony?  Or are you just saying?  I'm like, no, this is fucking great.  Because you would lie on the air, but not on Paltok. 
[01:25:00]  Not on Paltok.  Exactly.  Right?  You're right.  You're going to type, yeah, I'm saying it's good, but boy, it really sucks.  That must be a new...  We sure pulled it over on all those people.  That's got to be a new listener, because they all know we'll tell if it's good or not  after he leaves.  Exactly.  Shit.  I wanted to ask you something about bullshit, because I was watching it recently.  I fucking love the show.  Was it harder as time went on to get people that weren't on to the fact that you might 
[01:25:30]  fucking say some nasty shit about them?  Well, let me tell you, you know, I have a real problem with Michael Moore and even with Borat.  You know, I have a little problem with misrepresenting.  Right.  We would go to the people and say, we do a show called Bullshit.  Here is a DVD.  Penn and Teller disagree with you.  Do you want to go on the show? 
[01:26:00]  You know, that's what we would say.  The next thing you say, I'm Dr. Maury Smith, and I think...  And we had all sorts of video of people, like, picking their nose and all this stuff.  We would never use it.  We tried to attack ideas.  As a matter of fact, as the years went on, I kept saying, well, you know, we can be mean.  To the guys on our side.  Yeah.  So we actually would have more trouble getting people to agree with us, because they'd go,  I've been noticing this show.  Yeah, you see a trend.  You just, you attack our ties and how we look and our hair. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Like, well, that's because we agree with you.  We don't want to make it too easy for you.  You know, so like the guys from Reason Magazine, like Nick Gillespie, like the Libertarian guys.  Right.  We would call up, like, every three shows and have the same people on, people from the Cato Institute and stuff.  We'd have them on.  They'd go, well, last time you had me on.  And you're like, really?  Fuck with me.  We go, yeah, we agree with everything you said.  They said, yeah, but what's wrong with my suit jacket?  Or hair or something.  Constantly bad.  But, you know, we would have, and there's a sad side of this, too, which is that everybody that we would have on and bash and tear to pieces, rip a new asshole, they would do better after they were on the show. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, man.  Of course.  Of course.  Well.  So they all knew that, you know, and they all knew they would go through that.  And they also knew that we would attack their ideas, but not there.  You know, we did one thing on this show, which I thought was really funny.  I did this thing where I said, you know, people think we take people out of context.  They think that we pull out the stupidest thing they say.  We would like to show you a minute and a half of what we get as raw material, not context. 
[01:27:30]  And we had one of the, I think it was on the Bible show, the creationism show.  We had a guy do his full hunk without editing.  And it was really funny.  Because we would do our editing to make them look better.  Because, you know, if you're doing drama, your hero is only as strong as your villain.  Right.  Right.  So if you have people that are too, you know, James Bond wants to have a really, really good villain. 
[01:28:00]  You don't want James Bond going up against a 16-year-old shoplifter.  You know?  Boom, ba-dum, boom, boom, boom.  It's easy to discredit somebody if their argument sucks or they're stupid or they come off looking ridiculous.  We would spend all this time making the enemies look really, really good and concise so that I could come in and go,  man, Ben just took that fucker apart.  Whereas in reality, if you saw the full hour and a half, you know, a six-year-old could have taken them apart. 
[01:28:30]  So we'd be buoying, buoying people up.  Yeah.  But they always knew.  And the amazing thing I'll tell you, we did, you know, eight years of bullshit.  Eight years, like something like almost 90 shows, I think.  And not one lawsuit that stuck at all.  I mean, one person threatened.  Two people threatened but never took legal action.  That's as close as they came.  So we were really careful.  And you would love, and I told you this last time, but it's worth repeating.  You know, the lawyers, we worked with the same lawyers for eight years. 
[01:29:00]  And they would get really good at giving notes.  The notes of the script.  We really should have these up on the web or something.  Because in this very, very legal hand of a $600-an-hour lawyer, they would say,  not sure about this wording.  Could you call him cocksucker instead?  Not sure if this is actionable.  Maybe pull out cunt pickle.  You know?  Pull out that.  Would that be better? 
[01:29:30]  And then circled.  And then you also see stuff you never thought you'd see.  You never saw in your high school paper.  Which is cunt pickle, circled, next to it, good.  We're really safe.  Because, you know, after eight years, you really run out of obscenity.  Oh, true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you really, you say.  It's the same old thing over and over.  We've used motherfucker eight times in this show.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, we need, we need something else.  And when they told us, I was really proud of this. 
[01:30:00]  They told us for the chiropractor show that absolutely nowhere in the show, any place,  could I even hint at the word quack.  Quack.  They said, you say the word quack, I'm telling you, you'll lose your house.  It's that simple.  They're all listening.  Their lawyers are all on.  Keep that away.  And, by the way, for those listening now, I'm not saying chiropractors are quacks.  I'm just saying we couldn't say those two things.  So, I'm going, you know, I just feel like such a pussy not being able to use the word 
[01:30:30]  the whole show.  So, I said, for the shoot, I wrote in the script, you know, for the call sheet, I wrote,  we want 100 ducks.  Yes.  100 ducks.  And we just dumped ducks all over the set.  And I was just going, sue them.  Just sue them all you want.  So, I'd be going, you know, we're talking about chiropractor.  Yeah, that was brilliant. 
[01:31:00]  And I never said it.  And the ducks are all over it.  We never even explained.  We never said, like, they're speaking for us.  Oh, you didn't have to.  Never underlined it.  And we did the multi-level marketing.  I love that one.  The word you can't use is pyramid.  So, we had a, you know, a blue screen of Gaza behind us with the pyramids.  And we were in Egyptian outfits.  And no mention of pyramid schemes.  You couldn't say that word?  No.  Oh, no. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Wait, are you worried, too, when you say, like, they're all watching, like, if you say  so-and-so's a quack or this profession's a quack, that people watching in that profession  can sue because you're hurting them?  Or just people you're...  It's very, very difficult if we say chiropractic in general.  Da-da-da-da-da.  But our problem was we had a particular person on screen.  Right, right.  Okay.  And then, if the show included that, that could be stopping them from making a living.  Right.  Defamation of character.  There's all sorts of things that are there.  And also all sorts of things that I hate it when this is true. 
[01:32:00]  But a lot of times the law is correct, you know, and you shouldn't be able to rip an individual  apart without me doing due diligence.  And what exactly would be due diligence for me to call someone a quack?  I mean, how much research do I have to do before, in good conscience, I'm not even talking  legally, but morally, how much do you have to know before you discredit someone's entire  medical practice?  Now, in general, it's really easy to do.  And in theory, it's really easy to do. 
[01:32:30]  But an individual, you want to be very, very careful.  And they could easily call people that would say, this person helped me and changed my  life.  Sure, sure.  So that there goes your argument right there.  That poor bastard that was selling the drinks on that multi-level...  Oh, that was heartbreaking.  Oh, I felt so bad for that.  I mean, that was one of the shows where we didn't really have villains.  No, no.  We were so much on their side.  It was just a fucking cast of victims, that show.  Can you explain?  I didn't see that one.  Well, multi-level marketing are like when they have a product that you sell to your  friends. 
[01:33:00]  Right, right.  Of course.  And there's always X amount of money to get in.  So you pay $5,000 and you get a case of this stuff that you're going to sell to your friends.  And it's never about selling the stuff.  It's about selling the business to another person.  Of course.  So the stuff, you can't possibly make money on the stuff.  You sell the whole business.  Yeah, I want to know about the guy that you felt sorry for.  So, you know, we did this when there was a real downturn in the economy.  And a lot of people who'd lost their jobs were investing $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 of their 
[01:33:30]  savings to get into this business and then trying to get their other friends into it.  And then finding out that they didn't want to rip off their friends and had a cellar full  of shit they couldn't sell and had also taken, I mean, if you lose your job, even if you  don't lose your job, $5,000 is a serious chunk of change.  You know, it's not like, we're not looking at people losing like $100, you know, which  still is a serious amount of change.  That's a lot of groceries.  I don't mean to dismiss that.  But I'm talking about $5,000 changes what you do for the next two months. 
[01:34:00]  It really does change what you do.  No matter who you are, that changes it.  And we were getting people to put this money in, and these were people who had been ripped  off and sucked in and, you know, were on camera going, you know, I'm not going to sell this  business to my friends because I would just be ripping off my friends.  Yeah, because they realized, like, it just doesn't...  So I guess I'm just kind of eating this.  When he went to...  How bad was the product, though?  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, it's a widget. 
[01:34:30]  It doesn't matter at that point.  The products are all okay.  Just okay, though.  But, I mean, it doesn't matter how good they are.  The fact is, you can't make money unless you sell the whole business.  And it's simple.  It's one of those simple things you see.  It's shaped like a triangle.  Yeah, exactly.  Like a three-dimensional triangle.  Legally, why wouldn't somebody classify it as pyramid?  Is the pyramid thing kind of like a...  Is that a copywritten thing?  No, pyramid is a legal term. 
[01:35:00]  A Ponzi scheme or pyramid.  Like a Ponzi scheme would be, let's say, Social Security.  There you go.  Which is, if you get it early, you make a lot of money.  I'm just telling you right now, if you're under 25, Social Security, you're getting fucked.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just in case no one else has told you that, at least you can hear it on O&A.  All the money you put into Social Security, you are not getting it back.  Look at classic pyramid schemes.  The base can never support what's on top of it.  The big trick of a pyramid scheme is be the first guy. 
[01:35:30]  Be that fucking pointy stone.  If you haven't thought of the pyramid scheme yourself, you don't want to be involved in it.  Exactly.  If you've thought of it yourself, you've got a good chance of getting your money back.  I went to one of those.  I remember the company name and everything.  When I was newly sober, a guy in the program took me, and I was probably like 1988 or something  like that, and he took me to one of these companies, and I was like, oh God, there's  something good.  And then something inside me went, eh, shit.  Well, I got taken to an Amway. 
[01:36:00]  It was Amway meeting.  Yeah.  And no one, it's very, it's very vague.  No one wants to tell you what it is.  It's like, just come.  It's a great opportunity.  And you're like, what?  What is it?  No, it's got to be presented.  The whole thing's got to be presented.  They never tell you first.  You can't tell, so I sit there, and there's a woman, and she's got a chalkboard, and she's  writing, and she's making a big triangle.  And she's going and going and going, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm sitting there going like, what the fuck is this?  And she goes, well, this was known as, and she writes, on the blackboard, she's like, 
[01:36:30]  the American way.  It's like, this is the American way, selling things.  She goes, we shortened it to Amway.  And I'm like, fuck, they got me.  Fuck.  That's brilliant.  God damn it.  And I'm sitting there like, oh, gosh.  See, I'm thinking the big mistake is getting people who are newly sober.  Don't you want people shit-faced drunk?  What a great idea.  I'm thinking when you're new, you're eager to change your life and do something.  Yeah, I'll just sell this stuff. 
[01:37:00]  It'll be great.  Were you actually selling this stuff, Am, for a while?  No, no.  I was fucking, like, pissed that I had to stay the rest of the meeting.  Yeah, you realized.  The second she's at Amway, because I'd heard about Amway.  I never knew how it was presented.  If I did, I would have known this was playing Amway.  So when they got me, and I'm like, what is she getting at?  Fucking get to the point.  Oh, fuck, it's Amway.  How long was it?  How long was the meeting?  It seemed like it's still going on.  It's like the timeshare thing, where they say, free this and free that, you just got 
[01:37:30]  to go to the timeshare.  Get a free hibachi to sit through the whole thing.  Meanwhile, why don't you calculate what your time as a human is worth per hour, and how  much that hibachi ends up costing you in your time, right?  The hibachi is also, because I went, because I wanted to learn about it.  So I went to the full timeshare.  In Vegas, you know, timeshare capital.  And they pulled people off the strip, you know, to get a hibachi.  And it was, I think, four and a half hours to get a hibachi that I thought was probably  worth about $3.  Right.  How does it work, the timeshare? 
[01:38:00]  The timeshare is you buy a property that you can use two weeks a year.  Oh, two weeks.  Okay.  So, you know, or three weeks, whatever you buy.  We had one in our family.  Yeah.  You chip in with a bunch of people, and they get a bunch of your family.  Well, there's a company that sells them, and they break them up.  Basically, you've got to go on vacation to the same shitty fucking condo every year.  That's what it comes down to.  And you have to, how far in advance do you work out what weeks are yours?  You know, all that depends.  It looks great at first, but then year after year, you're going back to the same place. 
[01:38:30]  And then they'll also tell you that you can trade that for another place.  You know, you buy your timeshare in Terre Haute, and you can get the one in, you know, Aspen.  Yeah, sure.  Sure you can.  It turns out that deal's a little hard to make.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, because why would the Aspen guy go to your shitty place?  Yeah.  You're right.  But they do them everywhere.  And every family, you know, every family has somebody in them that did that.  And all you've got to do is you've got to do the arithmetic, but you've got to do it on your own. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  You can't do the arithmetic with the guy they're helping you.  No.  Which is always good advice on any business deal.  Do your arithmetic in private.  Don't have the guy who's making the deal with you go, yeah, don't get, you don't have to carry the three.  Oh, I guess I don't have to carry the three.  Right.  All right.  Just add it right down.  Whatever you say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, getting fucked.  You're going to let Penn go.  He's got a busy day.  He's a very busy man.  They're telling us, by the way.  Amazing.  For real.  Amazing ice cream.  I really, I love this stuff. 
[01:39:30]  I'm going out and buying some.  Good.  And bringing it home.  Please.  Cases.  And it only counts until Saturday.  Oh, fucking cases.  There will still be ice cream after that, but I don't give a fuck about it after that.  I walk for my charity, buy it right now, get the ice cream, and it's wicked good.  It is great.  So it's one of the few times you can actually eat ice cream and be helping a charity.  This money does not go to a certain P. Gillette.  This money, I mean, for all you want to be cynical about Celebrity Apprentice, I am looking, 
[01:40:00]  if I do it right this Sunday, $350,000 for a charity that really does great work.  That's huge.  Of course, if I lose, it's $350,000 for a charity that also does great work.  But anyway.  But you want to be the guy.  I would like to be the guy.  So we're not even going to mention the other guy.  I think you're in.  But you're selling ice cream with the other guy today at $2.30 at Union Square right here  in New York City.  I want to bring up one more thing about bullshit that I just remembered also.  You say, you know, the people that you didn't agree with, you wouldn't lay into them or bash 
[01:40:30]  them.  But man, would you do a great job of keeping the camera on them just a little too long.  That is when they would talk and they're done talking.  They'd look at the camera and do that uncomfortable look to the side thing.  Oh, fucking hilarious.  We would do that every time.  And by the end, they were going, you're going to do that, I say my name in the camera, and  then I'd stand there a little too long.  Looking a little too long.  Yeah, we are. 
[01:41:00]  That's brilliant.  And it was just great because that was shot, you know, by local crews.  We didn't have the money to send crews out.  So we'd just be calling people going, and make sure you leave the camera on them.  Just too long.  A couple extra seconds.  Okay, thank you.  Always a pleasure.  Oh, Penn, you're one of our faves.  You know that.  Well, I should say fave rants.  I don't want to say fave rants.  You'll be on my show.  Oh, yeah.  I'm on Sunday night.  Well, I'm on Celebrity and Bread.  And do we need to promote the Penn and Teller dates, or are you good there?  No, I think we're sold out.  Yeah, all right.  So fuck it.  Yeah, right?  Go get the ice cream. 
[01:41:30]  Go get the ice cream.  Penn Jillette's Swizzle, right?  Swirtle.  Swirtle.  Swirtle.  Swizzle.  Swizzle.  Jesus.  Swirtle.  Swirtle.  Swirtle.  But the problem is, Swirtle's really small on the packaging.  All right.  There he goes.  Go buy Penn's ice cream.  Look, he's not in the room.  It's so fucking good.  Yeah, of course.  I can't stop eating this shit.  That fucking ice cream, it was like a fucking little tin of that girl's camel top.  It was really delicious.  His more, his Penn left his here, too. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, it's so good.  And whoever wants it, I don't like throwing it out, because it's fucking good food.  It's getting mushy now.  Yeah.  Which is also good.  Got him.  It's in that fucking, oh, it's mushy.  Hold on.  Does Troy want some?  I gave the rest of mine to E-Rock.  He's a great guest.  He's phenomenal.  He's a really smart guy.  He is an amazing guest.  Eric, what do you think?  It's so fucking good.  I'm not a fan of chocolate or ice cream, really, but that is delicious.  How about Sal?  The salt is amazing.  Yeah, the salt's great.  Did Sal try it?  Sal, did you try it?  No, he didn't try it. 
[01:42:30]  Sal, Sal, come in and get you a new spoon.  Go in and get some.  And try some fucking celebrity ice cream.  If I knew there was, like, sea salt in the chocolate, I'd have been like, what?  No, no, no.  Yeah, I see salt.  Sea salt rules.  Sea salt's the best.  I see Paris.  I see France.  I see no fucking underwear right there.  Hey, Rock, you get the sea salt thing, right?  I use it for steaks.  Potato chips are great.  That big potato.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[01:43:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  It's all over your shirt, Sal.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Sal.  He's used to that.  Yeah, exactly.  On his back, though.  On the back of the head.  Same color, right, Sal?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's like fucking sperm on your shirt.  No, wait, no.  It's like fucking cum.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Continues in moments.  Continues in moments.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:30]  I don't eat anything in here, and I'm eating this like a maniac.  I got a read to do, and you know what I'm doing?  I'm shoving another fucking spoon in my mouth.  Oh, oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that is great.  I would go out and try it.  I'm not even, I'm not even fronting.  Yo.  The OPN Anthony Channel.  Who taught you how to do this stuff? 
[01:44:00]  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  On SiriusXM.  What we have here is the best of both worlds.  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer,  onboard memory, and 30 years of human experience and interaction.  BoboCop, what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust, protect the innocent,  uphold the law, and to jerk off in a toilet, all right?  Part man, part robot.  Complete imbecile. 
[01:44:30]  Alive or dead?  Dead or alive?  You're...  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid.  Eat a bowl of dick.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  Can I do this?  Please respond.  We have a 63 in progress. 
[01:45:00]  All right, let's go, Mr. Maloon again.  BoboCop.  Who is he?  What is he?  I suck.  The dumbest, most annoying person on the planet is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  BoboCop, BoboCop.  Any special message for the kids at home?  Believe me, you're right.  You gotta wear a condom when you go to sleep,  because you don't want to jizz in your pants when you're...  BoboCop?  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, stay out of trouble.  BoboCop. 
[01:45:30]  SiriusXM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  She fuckin' hates me.  Trust, she fuckin' hates me.  La, la, la, la.  I tried too hard, and she told my feelings like I had none.  And ripped them away.  I used to like Puddle of Mud. 
[01:46:00]  I'm getting some shit for it in the studio right now from Travis.  Was this 90s?  She's never into them.  What year was this?  It was 90s.  Sound a little bit like Kurt Cobain, you know.  Well, it was exactly Kurt Cobain.  I know, but they had a couple catchy songs. 
[01:46:30]  Are these the Let the Body Hit the Floor, people?  No, that was Puddle of Mud.  Drowning the Kid.  Trust, she fuckin' hates me.  Thanks.  This does sound like Nirvana, though.  Sam's on your side, though.  Sam, you liked Puddle of Mud?  Yeah.  It was one of those things where you definitely, like, when you first heard them, you're like,  okay, this is a band that sucks.  Right.  But I like this band.  It was just, I don't know, there was a few songs that were catchy.  In retrospect, I think they were the Nickelback of their time.  Oh.  Oh, shit. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  I don't come back from that.  I know every word.  I can't argue that one.  You know why Eric's playing this?  Why?  Of course I know why you're playing this.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's a news item.  Yes.  No, it's because of what he likes to root around in.  Oh, boy.  I didn't mean that.  This is the one I really like.  But he played the other one because it goes with the story that's out today.  Yes.  We all know the songs, though.  They were big.  Puddle of Mud, lead singer arrested for domestic abuse.  Oh, what did he do? 
[01:47:30]  Did he smack a bitch?  Yeah.  Didn't Fred Durst discover Puddle of Mud?  Wow.  That would make a lot of sense.  Yeah, it would.  Genius.  That is Fred Durst.  Hey.  A couple of nerds to like Puddle of Mud.  You like this or not, Ed?  It's so generic.  But you're a 90s guy.  Yeah, but they got to the point in the 90s where everything became this generic 90s sound.  Right.  And this was like 99.  Yeah, yeah.  This was barely 90s.  Are we going to do our bi-monthly 90s rock bill?  I know, right?  I'm thinking.  All right.  Let's do it. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  You know, Iraq, have we ever discussed 90s music?  I have Eve 6 and Everclear loaded, too.  Jesus.  Let's get to the...  15 years ago, the Seinfeld finale aired.  How about that?  And there's still...  Fucking forever ago.  There are still Subway ads promoting the replays of that.  15 years later.  Wow.  What?  There's Subway ads in my Subway station.  Like they've been there for 15 years?  No, I'm saying that you don't see a show...  I'm going to clean up, right?  Shut up.  All right.  You don't see a show 15 years after it ended. 
[01:48:30]  They're still being promoted.  Well, yeah.  That's pretty...  Eric doesn't know when to turn it.  Make it louder.  This is terrible.  I tried to.  Like these songs came out 2001.  Like this is after.  Yes.  This is after rock rap.  This actually made people forget how bad 9-11 was.  Oops.  You like this?  Nah.  It's kind of dope, though.  They really fell off fast.  God. 
[01:49:00]  How do you come back from dragging your wife by her arm and shirt?  Oh.  That depends on where you were going.  Oh, my God.  Police were called to a business in West Hollywood on Monday afternoon, according to TMZ, after  Scantlin, who's the lead singer of Puddle of Mud, apparently dragged his ex-wife and  then pulled her by the arm or the shirt.  Oh, that's not being dragged.  He probably just grabbed her.  Like, come on.  A couple of pounds of pressure per second, per second.  I never touched one hair on her goddamn pussy.  Eh, trouble with the old sperm bank. 
[01:49:30]  I did that with the wife once when I was taking her out of that bar on an island because she  was upset that I brought my girlfriend to a gig when, you know, I was married.  The nerve of her to be upset by that.  Yes.  She was all drunk.  My God.  And I tried to guide her out of the bar because she was, like, going crazy.  So I grabbed her, like, by the shoulders and I'm guiding her out of the bar and she tripped  and her head went right into the front of the jukebox.  Did it start up a good song?  That would have been funny as fuck. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Would that have been fuck.  If the bitch's back came on.  Wes Scantlin had problems last June as well.  Cocaine possession.  Oh.  Whatever happened to Puddle of Mutt, are they still doing it?  They're trying to, but everybody thinks they're a shitty band.  I think they put out, like, one of those greatest hits plus a new song album last year or something.  You can't do that.  And, like, Limp Bizkit is still putting out new music, but everybody knows they're a shitty  band.  Their latest one was really good. 
[01:50:30]  What's it called?  No, it's not.  The one with, uh, who was it?  Lil Wayne?  Yeah.  It was good.  You don't like it?  Yeah, I might like it.  In case you didn't know this, this is another song.  This one wasn't too bad.  Yeah, turn this up a little bit.  I like this one.  I mean, it's generic, but.  Ah!  You don't like this at all, right, Jimmy?  This is like every arena before a concert song as people are walking in.  No, I don't like it. 
[01:51:00]  No?  No, I don't.  I kind of like it.  What if Ozzy liked it?  If Ozzy liked it, I would respect Ozzy's opinion, and I would keep my opinion to myself.  He won an Emmy for his performance last night on fucking CSI.  He's amazing.  Amazing.  How's the new song?  Oh, fuck.  I'm out of my mind for it.  You know, remember that Daniel Pearl guy?  You're beheaded and fucking, uh, by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  He found his remains 11 years ago.  That's 11 years already?  Wow.  Hanging from a bridge.  Holy fuck. 
[01:51:30]  Damn.  Yeah, hanging from a bridge, you're right.  What fucking pricks?  Pakistan.  Kachi.  Fucking pricks.  Yeah, I can't believe that was 11 years ago.  Anyone pay for that with a cruise missile?  Oh, yeah.  Well, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is fucking, uh...  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, 47 years ago, uh, Pendulet was talking about Bob Dylan.  Yeah.  Pendulet's a huge Bob Dylan fan.  Yeah.  I read his book.  I read Pendulet.  I read your book, you magnificent bastard.  And I like this book a lot.  Uh, Blonde on Blonde, 47 years ago. 
[01:52:00]  Featuring this song, of course.  Yeah, too.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You like this?  No.  Not a big Bob Dylan fan.  But why?  But are you a mixed 98.5 fan?  Linger.  Maybe that could be one of those nuggets.  A nugget.  On the podcast.  That should be a nugget.  Do we have next week's nugget picked out yet, Sam Roberts?  No, we do not.  And should we put Pendulet on the podcast?  I think so.  That's a strong segment.  Pendulet's always strong.  Edit that shit down and put that up there. 
[01:52:30]  I don't know if we need to edit it.  It's a podcast.  Yeah, it's true.  Don't edit it.  We can go long if we need to.  Let it go long form.  No, I don't like podcasts.  Be a long form.  These are bits, though.  It's different.  When you have control to kind of clean it up nice.  It's for the people.  Are you ready to blow, blow, blow, blow, blow?  Yeah, I will not be so all alone.  This isn't singing.  Yeah, everybody must get stoned.  Ugh.  Sorry.  You're on. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, it's terrible.  I respect you don't like Dylan, but I don't respect the fact that you get so annoyed by him.  I get angry at everything.  Why, though?  I don't know.  You don't like his voice?  Yeah, his voice annoys me to the point of anger.  He just bothers you, huh?  He's the slow car in the left lane.  Oh, man.  You ever listen to his radio show?  No.  That's pretty good shit.  Yeah? 
[01:53:30]  I do like Bob Dylan.  I don't love him.  I like him.  No.  There's nothing.  What else was on this album?  I really don't know.  What's this one?  Lay, lay, lay.  Yeah.  No.  It's like every song is, hey, bye, bye, bye, bye.  Lay, lay, lay, lay, lay across my big brass beard.  Same guy.  Stay, lay, lay, stay.  Well, I would die, I feel so old.  Lay, lay, lay, lay.  Stone.  I agree with you.  I'm out of the dumb. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, with that dumb harmonica.  Oh, just like a woman's on this.  Just like a woman.  She's a cunt, just like a woman.  Oh, Stuck Inside a Mobile with the Memphis Blues again.  Can we play that one?  This was a huge album.  I know.  He's a songwriter.  He's not a fucking singer.  Give me Stuck Inside a Mobile with the Memphis Blues again. 
[01:54:30]  Just give other people his music.  It takes forever for him to get to the hook.  That's why I love it.  Should we just go to break again?  Start over?  Oh, E-Rock.  Should we do a reset?  You don't like Dylan either, huh?  You rock.  I can take it a little bit.  I can like it, though.  It's fucking enjoyable. 
[01:55:00]  No, it's really not.  How do you like this?  I like one song by him.  A song.  Don't think twice.  I don't know that one.  How do you sing like that?  It's stupid.  It's terrible. 
[01:55:30]  It's just not done.  I don't like it.  You really don't like him.  Yeah, tell us how you really feel.  Oh, shit, you fucking cock.  Well, we got a guy farting.  I guess we could play this instead.  Oh.  Instead of enjoying some Dylan.  You still have six minutes.  Same thing.  I'll play it out.  I'll give a fuck.  Fuck that.  Me. 
[01:56:00]  You still have a movie with a Memphis music game.  What year is this song?  47 years.  47 years.  Oh, my God.  That's 66, I guess.  1966.  66.  W.  Can we get into Ryan Lockie a little bit today, Sam Roberts?  I hope so.  I know you secretly control the radio show.  Oh, man.  Are we allowed to do that today?  Because I was reading an article on him today.  They're saying he's so dumb that it works. 
[01:56:30]  He's so dumb.  They're saying he's as dumb as like Jessica Simpson was.  Really?  But it's working on this stupid reality show of his, supposedly.  People love a himbo.  Never cared for Johnny Carson.  We got the fart first.  The Migs and Ryan Lockie.  Coming up next, more money, more problems.  A real issue for draft picks who become instant NFL millionaires.  When we come back, former NFL player King Johnson joins the desk 
[01:57:00]  to talk about all the things.  Did she fart?  I don't know who did.  I don't think it was her.  There was another guy in the studio.  That was a good one.  And then they edited it out of the next.  Oh, they did?  What?  Did you hear that again?  They had to edit a fart out of a program.  Why wouldn't you leave that?  You just leave it.  Coming up next, more money, more problems.  A real issue for draft picks who become instant NFL millionaires. 
[01:57:30]  When we come back, former NFL player King Johnson joins the rest.  King Johnson joins the desk to talk about off-the-field issues.  Who cut the gasser?  Yeah, do we know who cut the gasser?  Which one of those people cut the cheese?  Cut the cheese.  Remember cut the cheese?  Fucking hilarious.  Cut the cheese.  Someone cut the fucking cheese.  And then this is, they're meditating it out.  Coming up next, more money, more problems.  A real issue for draft picks who become instant NFL millionaires. 
[01:58:00]  When we come back, former NFL player Tank Johnson joins the desk.  See, they started the music a little earlier.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Most people think it was Skip Bayless.  Was that a replay or was that her just saying the same thing again?  Yeah, they replayed the same show.  Oh.  Except without the farts.  The fart list, yes.  Minus farts.  Someone cut the cheese.  Someone cut the cheese.  Cut the cheese.  I used to say that when I was a kid.  Cut the cheese.  Who cut the cheese?  Yeah.  The one who smelt it, dealt it.  The one who denied it, supplied it.  Cracked a rat was another one.  Right, denied it, supplied it. 
[01:58:30]  Cracked a rat?  Someone who cracked a rat.  Never, I haven't heard that one.  Cracked a rat was one.  I remember that.  The 30s?  Yeah, the 30s.  Someone shot an Indian.  What?  Wow.  My grandmother would say,  Oh, someone shot an Indian.  Oh.  Unless you'd hear you fart.  Some guy farted in front of me  and my brother at the mall one day  and he looked at us  and he said that we stepped on a frog.  Oh.  And he ran away.  What if someone stepped on a duck?  Yeah.  Well, that's crazy.  Is that before or after  he pinned you against the wall  and treated your mouth 
[01:59:00]  like a pocket pussy?  Oh.  The sound came out of your ass  during withdrawal.  A little queefing Travis.  We've got to help out Penn Jillette  because I'm learning the country guy.  You know,  is the favorite here, right?  Country artists have the whole country.  I forgot about that.  Trace Atkins is a formidable opponent  because, number one,  But he has a shitty ice cream.  No one likes maple in their ice cream.  Ha.  Here's the bro.  Hi, this is Trace Atkins. 
[01:59:30]  He's got a great voice, man.  Doesn't he do?  That guy's fucking voice is so deep  and his talking voice,  he does like a PSA or commercial  or some shit  and he's just,  Ha, this is Trace.  You can't even imitate it.  It's like all bottom end.  Do we know any of his songs?  Yeah.  He's big in country.  I'm Trace Atkins.  You know a Trace Atkins song?  For real?  Yeah.  I don't think I do.  Dancing by the Meadow.  No, it isn't.  Aw, yeah.  This is new country, bitches. 
[02:00:00]  Ladies love country, boys.  This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there.  Yee-hoo!  Do women want to fuck up?  Oh, what was that?  Jimmy!  I'm sorry, ice cream.  Oh, my God!  Ice cream, you scream.  Ice cream, you scream.  It's in the studio.  Listen up deep, brother.  Daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken.  Ballet, straight A's most likely to.  Where is that, Atlanta?  Oh, Pendulet's fucked.  Yeah.  4.5 million hits on this. 
[02:00:30]  I love this Trace Atkins guy.  4.5 million hits on that fucking video.  He gets pussy if he wants to?  He's done.  Yeah.  Poor Pend.  Plus, the country guys get money.  I don't know how they do it.  What do you mean?  But on the show, they do fundraising things.  Yeah.  And you just call your rich...  The celebrities call whatever rich celebrities they know to bring money.  Yeah.  And the country guys, especially like Trace, they get six figures from people.  Wow.  Pendulet's so fucked.  Could you find a Trace Atkins PSA?  His ice cream's way better, too.  I think Trace Atkins PSA.  See if you can find... 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Play one of these.  Listen to his speaking voice.  It's insane.  Food allergies result in more than 300,000 ambulatory care visits each year among children.  Hi, I'm Trace Atkins and my daughter, Brianna, is one of the three million children in the  U.S. living with potentially life-threatening food allergies.  To learn more about food allergies, please speak with your doctor or visit foodallergy.org.  More than 12...  Oh, or...  He could have a broadcasting career if he didn't have a...  It's a semi-successful country career. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, that's right.  A public service from Pham.  The food allergy and anaphylaxis...  The Pham!  Public service from the Pham!  Plus, he's playing for the American Red Crow.  Of course.  Oh, Pham's so fucked.  And his ice cream is...  I forgot the middle America country...  Like, country is the number one music, and...  It's not a vote.  No?  What?  It's not a vote.  People can't...  Donald Trump picks.  They gotta get out and buy it.  Right.  But if they sell a lot of fucking ice cream...  Right.  I'm gonna buy Trace Atkins ice cream. 
[02:02:00]  I don't even know who that Jew is, that Pan...  Yeah.  It's not a Jew.  Why?  He's a big Jew who don't like God.  I like Trace, and I like God.  I like an artist that loves the Lord, not the tribe that done killed him.  Yeah.  What?  He makes a lot of things disappear.  I don't trust him.  That Panjulet.  Julet.  Isn't that Panjulet?  He looks like a Jew.  I just assumed.  They both got ponytails.  You might as well go with Trace.  I'm just glad I ain't got a pick-a-nigger. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, my God.  What?  Wow.  Well, that's how they talk.  I mean, and Lil Jon was in the Final Four, so...  He was?  Yeah.  Thank God they got him out there.  You got some trickery.  You wanted to say that word today, and you figured out how to say it.  Please, it was the 20th time I'd said it already.  This hour.  You're 21, right, Ant?  20th.  Oh, shit.  Fuck yeah, the cops!  Chip and the cat. 
[02:03:00]  I fucking had a fight with the cops.  Fuck yeah, I threw all their guns away.  I'm like, go pick them up, flat foot.  Flat foot.  What's Trace's ice cream?  Maple and what else?  Macadamia.  Macadamia and maple.  Oh, my God, who wants that shit?  You don't want macadamia and maple.  What's the basic flavor?  Like, in Penn's Lead.  Oh, so they're...  All right.  Yeah.  So vanilla's the base, and then it's maple and...  Macadamia.  Maple and macadamia.  But it's got his picture on it?  What does his ice cream carton look like? 
[02:03:30]  Let's see Trace's picture.  Because Trace is one of those country guys.  It looks like a real man and everything.  I bet it's the same as Penn's.  Or nobody did the design.  Do you think?  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Look, with the cowboy hat, though.  He's like, hi, I'm Trace Egg.  Exactly.  And who's a little more sexy?  Let's be honest.  Trace has his shirt unbuttoned a little bit up top.  Penn looks like a fucking...  Penn looks like someone that worked on the fucking Manhattan Project.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, our pal's fucked.  Penn Jillette looks like he could be Jewish. 
[02:04:00]  He does.  And Trace looks like a good-time party fucking country boy.  Why didn't Penn Jew it down a little bit?  I know.  Fuck.  They actually have him standing in front of a bank with his fist raised.  Oh, my God.  You had to go less Jew-y.  I know.  For middle America.  Look, they actually made the lid of the ice cream a yarmulke.  Yeah.  Pull it off.  This pay is coming down the side.  You're not supposed to write, buy this and God dies a slow death.  That's not going to sell.  There's a dude with a goatee and a cowboy hat and the American Red Cross logo next to him. 
[02:04:30]  It couldn't be more American.  Why not support the troops?  Right.  I know.  Penn's got a yarmulke with an al-Qaeda thing on the trip.  Right.  Support Penn's ice cream.  That's the point we're making.  You just see American flag when you look at Trace's ice cream.  That's it.  God.  I don't care what flavor.  I thought Penn had this.  I thought Penn had it in the bag, too.  And then I realized, ah, you know.  You know what the best part about Celebrity Apprentice this whole season was?  Huh?  Watching everybody go into the boardroom. 
[02:05:00]  And Donald Trump loves Gary Busey.  Yeah.  So he would never fire him.  And he would always say, who's the weakest player on the team?  Oh, no.  And the people would always be like, well.  Gary.  It was Gary.  But they knew every time.  Donald would be like, yeah, but Gary's kind of a genius.  So let's go beyond that.  Kind of a genius.  They would let him skate.  He would let him skate every time.  He likes Gary.  He loves Gary.  Gary made it to, like, the top five.  I didn't watch this season.  It sounds like the welfare system.  Fuck.  How is that?  You know, people that you know aren't that good and doing things. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  And then they just keep getting supported and pushed along.  He's saying Donald Trump supports welfare?  They're not contributing.  Hey, why don't we get Trump on?  Gary Busey is a burden to that show.  And he should be removed and sent back to where he came from.  No, because it's all ratings and he's good for the ratings.  Can we get Donald Trump on the phone?  Busey, right?  Oh, yeah.  Can we get Donald Trump on the phone?  We can work on that, I think.  We've got to help our pal out, Penn Jillette.  How are we going to do that, though?  We'll talk to Donald himself.  We're going to make sure we understand that, you know, Trace is an all-American guy, but 
[02:06:00]  Penn deserves this.  One for the Jews.  Now, what happens?  What happens?  Let's say Trace sells more ice cream.  He's going to.  But, okay.  Does now instantly that Donald Trump is going to pick him?  There are multiple tasks to this task.  So you have to sell the most ice cream, but you also have to make the most money.  So if Trace Adkin goes, hey, Garth Brooks, will you buy this one thing of ice cream for  $2 million? 
[02:06:30]  No way!  They can do that?  A hundred percent.  A hundred percent.  That sounds cheating.  A hundred percent they can do it.  But that sounds like cheating.  They do it every season.  It's all for charity, so they don't care.  And they go, hey, I'm the...  Like, there are people on the show that are saying, you can't fire me.  I'm the biggest fundraiser.  And so, like, if you have famous friends...  So then Penn can make his money disappear.  Trace's money disappear.  Like, he's a magician.  Who's that?  I got more info on Trace Adkins.  This guy does not lose.  What?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  I got to take this phone call.  I did not know. 
[02:07:00]  We got to look this up.  Make sure it's true.  But Clint in Alabama.  Clint.  Hey, guys.  I don't know if he got caught cheating on her or she was just crazy, but in 1994, his  ex-wife shot him through the heart and the lungs, and he lived.  They don't lose.  Trace's...  Oh, yes.  How is he going to lose?  In 1994, his second wife shot him during an argument.  He never pressed charges because he believed that she never meant to pull the trigger.  He's just a nice guy. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Atkins stated that their divorce was closure enough for him.  And the bullet went through his heart and his lungs?  How does that happen?  He said the only reason he lived through the incident was because he lived so close to  a hospital.  Oh, my God.  He's just a nice guy.  Yeah.  This is not good.  My interaction with him was very positive.  Oh, God.  You met Trace Adkins.  I walked by a window, and he, like, waved.  Because he, I guess, had seen my act.  And we took a picture together, and he was very nice. 
[02:08:00]  Where's the picture?  I have it.  I got it signed.  I don't believe you.  I don't play games.  I don't believe you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  E-Rock's saying we've got to read Blue Heeler's tweet.  I don't know where Blue Heeler's tweet is right now.  What does it say?  Why don't you just say it?  Who's Heeler?  Okay.  It says Trace Adkins has a PSA on food allergies, yet he's promoting a product with dairy and  tree nuts in it.  Yeah, but he can't do no wrong.  That's our point.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  That's our point.  He can't do no wrong.  Poor Penn.  The irony is so thick, you can cut it with a knife.  Plus, Trace was in Lincoln as Lincoln's lawyer.  He also has a character on King of the Hill.  Was he in Lincoln?  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  And then we learn a lot of people don't even know who Penn and Teller are after all  these years.  Yeah, yeah.  The thing he was talking about with Latoya was so funny.  It was on the episode.  Oh, yeah.  She was like a little put off that Teller wouldn't talk to her.  And then Mary Lou Henner or somebody had to be like, no, he doesn't talk. 
[02:09:00]  He's been doing this for 30 years.  Yeah, that's like his gimmick, you dummy.  How does she not know who Penn and Teller is?  She's in the entertainment business.  That Jackson family is...  They're insulated, man.  I understand regular fucking, you know, Joes.  Yeah.  Why not know who Penn and Teller are?  But if you're in the business, how do you not know?  That fucking Paris Jackson's looking very cute.  I gotta fucking say it.  She looks like she could have been Michael's biological kid. 
[02:09:30]  No, she doesn't.  Biological kid.  Not at all.  You'd better shine a blanket.  I know, right?  She looks really cute, though.  How old is she?  Well, I'm just saying she looks cute.  She, you know, she's got a few more...  Should we put her on the clock?  A few more minutes in the oven, but...  Should we put her on the clock?  Definitely put her on the clock.  Countdown clock?  Although I think I blew it yesterday with my tweet.  You tweeted her?  Well, I replied to one of her tweets.  What did you say?  Well...  Why did you reply to one of Paris Jackson's tweets?  Well, look.  Look for it. 
[02:10:00]  Do you follow her?  One of my...  Yes, I follow Paris Jackson.  Why?  Because she tweets a lot of pictures, and she's cute.  Did you find...  How many followers?  It's like a long tweet of hers with a picture in it and everything, and I come up on the picture.  Okay.  And she's got a picture, and I put,  Father-daughter pics are so sweet,  because she tweeted that...  Oh, my God.  Why would you...  She's holding a skeleton. 
[02:10:30]  She's with one of those medical skeletons,  and she's kind of holding it.  It's like Michael Jackson.  Yes, Chip.  That's what I meant.  I don't like her hair.  She looks terrible.  No, the hair doesn't look good there.  She looks a lot older there.  She looks better with...  Yeah, she does.  I think she's 30.  She's very pretty.  Right.  She's a pretty girl.  Father-daughter pics.  Father-daughter pics are so sweet.  Yeah, it's probably enough to blow it.  Yeah, I think so.  She was complaining yesterday that there was an imposter, Paris Jackson, 
[02:11:00]  that was stalking her and had a bunch of ridiculous tweets about Michael Jackson and stuff,  and it's not her.  She was asking for people to report that person.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Luke in Austin, Texas.  Luke.  Gentlemen, how are y'all doing this morning?  Oh, we're doing all right, Luke.  Right on.  If you want to hear Trace Adkins' deep, deep voice in a commercial, pull up a commercial  called ASCO, A-S-C-O. 
[02:11:30]  It's not funny.  Dude's voice on this commercial is...  Wait, what's it called?  ASCO.  ASCO.  Why do people do that?  ASCO, huh?  SHIP loves it.  Is it an ass company that they sell like assholes and stuff?  I don't know why they do that.  Oh, God.  All right, let's listen to this. 
[02:12:00]  This might be the voice you were talking about.  All right, maybe they appreciate things like honesty, hard work, doing the job right.  That's what keeps everything going.  Kind of like the folks at ASCO.  Hard-working people, hard-working case equipment, good honest baggage.  By giving you rent to own, lease, and even return options on rugged case equipment.  He's selling fucking bulldozers.  He seems so American.  Exactly.  Go buy yourself a goddamn bulldozer.  I'm Trace Adkins for fucking heavy machinery. 
[02:12:30]  Where is that commercial shown?  I don't know what that says.  It's got to be the Midwest.  Oh, yeah.  Texas.  Texas, yeah.  Is he popular there?  You need a good fucking backhoe in Texas.  Put it this way.  Most of the country sees that commercial.  Yeah.  We're just isolated here on the Northeast.  We don't think about that.  We think, you know, the city, the Northeast, it's everything.  No.  We're the fucking minority in how this country thinks it works.  Big fucking time.  Yeah.  Well, congratulations to Trace Adkins for winning the Northeast.  Trace Adkins. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, and then another part of the task is, like, they have to make a video, like, a commercial  advertising the ice cream.  Right.  And, of course, Trace's is going to be all, like, families and stuff.  I'm Trace Adkins.  If you love America, you love maple.  You love maple.  Ah, fucking.  They were showing Penn editing his commercial.  Yeah.  And they came across, they didn't know what to do, because they only had one close-up  of the ice cream.  And right behind it, you could see two showgirls' bedazzled crotches.  Oh, no. 
[02:13:30]  Next to the ice cream.  Oh, Donald Trump's going to kill for that.  Oh, and he's going to be like, hi, I'm Trace Adkins.  Right.  I don't have any vaginas in my commercial.  No.  This is about the Red Cross helping Americans.  Show a small boy that survived a fire.  Yes.  Being soothed with ice cream, Sav.  And then there's Penn.  If you like the vagina, you'll like my ice cream.  Oh, God, Penn.  Yeah.  No bullshit.  Yeah.  It's over.  Yeah.  Maybe we can get Donald Trump, though. 
[02:14:00]  On the show.  Convince him.  Yeah, maybe we can swear.  McDonald.  Maybe I'll make a hair joke.  Yeah.  That was a great joke.  What about the birthers?  Trace is the underdog.  Because last time he was on Celebrity Apprentice, he made it to the finals.  Uh-huh.  Piers Morgan beat him.  Then again, fucking Penn Jillette is very light, and he has well over a million on Twitter.  Trace Adkins only has 208,000.  Now, I'm not saying Twitter's everything, but he can reach a lot of people.  Wait, Trace Adkins only has a couple hundred thousand on Twitter? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I have more than that.  Oh, really?  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  I did not know that.  Okay, that's a good sign right there.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  Oh, look at these two.  Come on.  Who are you going to vote for?  I go with Penn Jillette.  I go with the more normal, relatable guy.  Yeah.  Well, the thing is, Trace is not more relatable to more of the country.  Oh, maybe he is.  It's crazy.  To me, he's not, but...  I don't even know what the hell he is.  I think he's a Jew. 
[02:15:00]  Some kind of Jewish.  Probably some kind of Jew, but maybe...  He looks a little Greek.  Not like American, like Trace.  Trace is obviously American.  Trace looks American.  Penn's like a Greek Jew.  He looks like a Greek Spanish Jew.  His ice cream is made out of pennies and weather control.  Going back to that commercial, it is being shown all over America, and he has cardboard  cutouts in the stores.  Uh-huh.  Oh. 
[02:15:30]  So, as you're buying your bulldozer, there's a cardboard cutout of Trace Adkins.  Trace Adkins.  Can you take a picture with him?  Yes.  Then again, everybody goes to Vegas, and you can't go to Vegas without seeing Penn on the  side of a building.  That's true.  You know, look, I'm pulling for Penn.  Oh, God.  More info on Trace Adkins.  Oh, no.  He's a man's man.  Yes.  He saved fucking ten children from a burning house.  Go ahead, Pete in Tennessee.  Pete.  Pete.  Hey.  Yeah, last year, his house burned to the ground.  Oh.  So, now he's got the sympathy of that.  What happened? 
[02:16:00]  I don't know.  He was away doing a concert, I think, in Vegas, and went home, house burned to the ground.  You know, at least we survived.  Everyone's all right.  No one got hurt.  I want to thank the firemen, the brave firemen that came to put the fire out.  But look, he had a safety plan in place that saved his kids.  His kids and wife.  Trace Adkins loses his house to fire, but safety plan saves kids.  He's just fine.  Oh, this guy's a miracle.  He's very thoughtful.  So, all he's got to do when he's up there, if he sees Donald going, like, well, Penn, 
[02:16:30]  you did raise the most money.  I was shot by my wife.  I'll go, you know, I know when I was shot.  When I was shot.  I know when my house burned down.  I'm going to choose who wins this year.  Oh, well, did I tell you my house burnt down?  Ouch.  It was a big fire.  My bullet wound is hurting me.  Yeah, oh, thank God I put a safety plan in place for my children and my wife.  Can we push play on that?  It's a video.  Yeah, let's see what the video is here.  Trace in his house. 
[02:17:00]  We were just hanging out.  The girls were watching TV.  I was in the office messing around on the computer.  And we heard this incredibly loud, like, bang explosion.  It sounded, like, glass breaking and stuff.  I mean, it was just crazy noise.  Flames flickered through a dark cloud.  Smoke nearly swallowing up firefighters.  Good.  Good writing.  Neighbors peeking through the trees to see the blaze.  The home of country music superstar, Trace Adkins, on fire.  And I ran from the office across the house to the garage. 
[02:17:30]  The nanny?  And the garage door, there's, like, a big window.  She's fuckable.  You can see the end of the garage.  And all I could see were just flames and smoke.  Nanny Lindsay Weaver runs with the girls, including two of Adkins' daughters, outside to a meeting place.  Before calling Adkins' wife, Rhonda.  And we were just three minutes from here.  We looked up in the sky.  We saw the black smoke.  I started driving here as fast as I could.  I put on the flashers and I just started passing people, going as fast as I could.  I even passed a cop.  He was, like, following me.  I'm, like, what are you doing? 
[02:18:00]  I'm, like, my house is on fire.  Inside the house, now a total loss are show clothes, Civil War weapons, awards, and most important to Rhonda Adkins, family pictures.  That's what I've lost.  I didn't back up all that stuff.  I backed up a lot of it, but not all of it.  And you hear people say this all the time.  Take the time and copy your photos.  But in the midst of neighbors and friends looking down the street at a home submerged in smoke,  the Adkins family says they're amazed. 
[02:18:30]  Everyone's okay.  Everybody got out.  No one's hurt.  My house is completely gone.  But at the end of the day, it's okay.  Yeah.  Oh, brother.  If you have kids, I guess, like, when you realize your kids are alive, what else, you know?  Can I, can I, we have more info on Trace Adkins.  Oh, okay.  Unless he started that fire, Penn's in trouble.  And I want Sam to back all this shit up.  I don't want any of these fuckers sneaking one past us today, Sam.  Okay. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  But Greg in Jersey has another fact about Trace Adkins.  Yes.  Greg.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Greg-y.  Hey, what's up?  A couple years ago, Trace has a funky finger because he had his finger amputated in an accident  and he had it reattached in a position so he could play his guitar.  Wait.  What's with this guy?  He has a finger?  But they didn't put it back normally because that would fuck up his guitar playing,  so they put it back in a weird way so he could play guitar? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, God.  All right.  What was the accident?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I just found another fact while I was looking for the finger thing.  All right.  But can we do the finger thing first or no?  I'm going to confirm the finger thing.  Okay.  But you want to add the other facts?  Let me add a little known fact about singer Trace Adkins.  Yes.  Is that his debut album, Dreamin' Out Loud, was dedicated to his brother, Scott.  Scott was 21 years old when he was killed in a truck accident.  Oh, Jesus! 
[02:20:00]  His brother was killed in a truck accident?  This is just an all-American way to die.  Now, what about his finger?  Yeah, a little known fact.  Oh, my God.  About country singer Trace Adkins is that his left little finger was cut off in a work  accident.  Just a workin' Joe.  Doctors reattached it, but his finger is permanently bent at an angle.  Because of this, Trace can't play many chords on a guitar anymore.  Oh, can't.  When he does play, he does the best that he can. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, my God.  He's just doing the best he can with a missing finger and shot through the heart.  Jesus.  He says he would love to learn the piano, but he realizes his deformed finger makes that  an impossibility.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh.  There you go, guys.  I gotta go.  Thank you.  Who has Penn's number?  Penn.  I don't think he realizes.  Penn is sunk.  He's in a lot of trouble.  He should just skate today.  He shouldn't try at all.  No.  Forget the ice cream.  It's not worth it.  Fuck that he has the greatest ice cream. 
[02:21:00]  Doesn't matter.  So, you gotta go out and buy a pan of ice cream.  Wait, can you make a...  You know, we're all about having a nice list on this show, Sam.  Yeah.  I'm losing track.  Yeah, what's the fuck?  I'm losing track of how great this guy is.  About fucking...  Do you think we like lists on this show?  Yes, I love them.  We love a good list.  Maybe we...  Can we do a side-by-side list?  What do we know about Penn Jillette?  We can figure this out.  Penn has had some tragedy, though.  The mother, father, and sister have died.  His mom made it to 95, I think.  Yeah, I know, but it's never easy.  Oh, let's make the list. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, man.  Okay, I'm making the track.  Trace Atkins is...  You start with Trace Atkins, has deformed finger.  Penn Jillette has masterful use of his hands.  I got another Trace Atkins fact coming in.  Oh, what do you got?  It just doesn't end.  Chris in Colorado.  Chris.  Hey, Trace is also a spokesman for the Wounded Warrior Project.  Yes, I've heard those...  One of the top charities in America. 
[02:22:00]  And Penn wants to sue the army every time an IED is destroyed.  Oh, shit.  That's not looking good for Penn.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Trace brought up a soldier in a wheelchair at the Academy of Country Music Award.  What?  A soldier in a wheelchair.  When it was supposed to be about him that night, he decided...  He's got no legs.  ...called the Wounded Warrior Project.  Tonight, the Academy of Country Music's charity, Lifting Lives, Trace Atkins, and the West Point Glee Club are helping people like me through the performance you're about to see. 
[02:22:30]  As you listen to this song, please consider that it's not about the war.  It's about the warrior.  Oh.  And now Trace gets out and...  It's a great charity.  Yeah.  Oh, it's been fucked.  Now he's going to sing something real nice.  I was there in the winter of 64... 
[02:23:00]  Oh, Vietnam.  What?  ...when we camped in the ice at Nashville's door.  Nashville.  300 miles our trail had led.  We barely had time to bury our dead.  Oh.  This fucker really has a good voice.  Jesus.  ...when the ants are charged and the colors flare.  Oh, 1864. 
[02:23:30]  Overton Hill was a living there.  Before that, Budinsky.  When we called a tree, it was almost dark.  I died with a grape shot in my heart.  Oh, almost dead when his wife shot him.  Say a prayer for peace.  Oh, it's a Say a Prayer for Peace commercial.  What a good song.  By the way, he was an oil rig worker before he was a country singer.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  Of course he was.  Doing man's work.  A wildcat?  What do they call him?  And we have more facts coming in.  A roughneck?  Brian in Pittsburgh.  Brian.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I was a couple years ago down in Nashville at the Country Music Fest, and he was performing  along with a lot of other people, and this was right after his house had burned down.  Apparently there were a lot of charities that popped up online, people putting together,  donating money to him and his family to help rebuild and all that stuff.  He announced at that concert that, A, he was taking all that money and donating it because 
[02:24:30]  he flat out said, hey, guys, I don't need it.  Help out people that need the help, and ask anybody that donated money at that concert  to give it to the homeless and stuff like that.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  I love Penn, but he's kind of fucked.  He's kind of fucked on this one.  That's why Penn was focusing on his ice cream.  Is there any scandal in Trace's life?  That song was great, wasn't it?  Oh, see.  Is that his song?  Prayer for Pete.  It is one of his, like, hits. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, he wrote that.  We'll play it into break today.  This list is not, this side-by-side is not looking good.  I know.  No.  Hold on.  One more fact.  Phil.  Phil.  Phil.  Hey, guys.  One of Trace's good friends was T. Boone Pickens.  Oh, yeah, the oil guy.  Yeah, so he always called.  He called him on one task, and he gave him a bunch of money for charity for him, too.  Yeah, that guy's worth about a bill, right?  A billion?  Billionaire?  Yeah, just a little bit.  Fuck.  He's got billionaire friends, too. 
[02:25:30]  Did he add that to the list?  He's got billionaire friends.  Yeah.  I don't have any, uh...  Someone's saying he has a phobia, but I don't know.  Now I think we're getting the people goofing.  Let me see what Greg says.  Greg in DC.  Greg?  Yeah, um, he's unable to actually hold his wife and kiss her on the mouth.  He's unable to trunk kiss.  That wasn't funny.  I don't even know what he said.  Like, what?  What do you mean he wasn't able to hit her in the mouth? 
[02:26:00]  Kiss her.  Yeah.  Who's kissing...  Front kiss.  Front kiss.  Dude, you...  I know, hey.  It sounded funnier in my head.  So in a bullet.  I got bad news.  All right, Greg, thank you.  No, you re-upped?  Oh, come on.  I don't have a contract.  This is the guy who created the song. 
[02:26:30]  Honky Tonk, Badonkadonk.  That's Trace Adkins.  Yeah, what song is that?  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  Remember that?  Honky Tonk.  Honky Tonk, Badonk, Badonk, Badonk, Badonk.  Keepin' perfect real.  Big song.  Make you roam and swang along.  Got it going on.  He knows to have fun.  We went over this song with Patrice, didn't we?  Yes, we did.  Yes.  Get the sheriff on the phone.  Lord have mercy.  How she even gets them wrenches on. 
[02:27:00]  That honky tonk.  Man, that's a terrible song.  Oh, it's awesome.  Huge hit.  Wow.  All right, are we done with the list?  Do you want me to go?  I have a list for Penn and a list for Trace.  I want to read the Trace list first.  All right.  All right, that's fair enough.  Okay.  And you tell me who you think is going to win.  Supposedly he's like the underdog.  Tell me who you think is going to win Celebrity Oppressions.  Sure.  This is Trace Adkins.  Okay.  He was shot in the heart but didn't press charges against his ex-wife for doing it. 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  His house burned down but his kids survived because they had a fire plan.  He helps the Wounded Warriors Project.  He sells bulldozers.  His finger's been amputated but he keeps trying.  He has a wonderful voice.  He's selling ice cream for the Red Cross.  He used to be an oil rig worker.  He gave money given to him for a new house to charity.  He has billionaire friends and he's not afraid to have a little fun. 
[02:28:00]  Did he get his dead brother?  Yeah, what about the dead brother?  Oh, fuck.  How did I forget?  Sam, how did you forget that one?  I'm also hearing about a car accident.  I found a site here that talks about country music and it just lists a couple of Trace's injuries.  Yeah.  This one says here,  In 1982, a bulldozer accident resulted in deep cuts to Trace's hindquarters.  He thought he was fixin' to lose both his legs.  Fixin'.  It has a quote to say from him.  Wow.  Lose his legs, yeah.  Yes.  And then he was in an oil tank explosion in 1983. 
[02:28:30]  Guys, while he was trying to repair a leak, crushing his left leg.  Damn.  What was Penn thinking?  This guy's like the Terminator.  Oh, no.  On Twitter it's comin' in.  Yeah.  Little known fact, Trace Adkins donated both kidneys to a kitten with leukemia.  What a guy.  I added, his brother died when he was 21, so Trace dedicated his first album to him.  Yeah.  What was that song you were singing that I really liked? 
[02:29:00]  Honky Tonk, Badonkadonk?  No!  Say a Prayer for Peace.  I can't find that on iTunes.  Two people were killed in a collision with his tour bus.  Oh, my God.  And then he was in an accident as a teenager.  Why?  Come on!  This guy's just all tragedy.  Let's say hi to Jason in Detroit.  Are you just fuckin' with us?  No, I actually looked it up on Wikipedia, so I do want to take that as a source.  Okay.  He was driving his 1955 pickup truck as a teenager, and he hit a bus head-on, broke both his legs 
[02:29:30]  and his arm.  He survives a head-on collision with a bus?  They really, God wants those legs of his, but he ain't giving them up that easy.  No, he's not.  Should we go to Wikipedia before we finalize the list?  Yes, you're right.  When you were talking about his finger being cut, I'm trying to remember, did you explain  what he was doing and how he did it?  No, I don't think so.  All right.  This says, in 1989, he nearly cut off his finger trying to open a can of pipe dope with  a six-inch buck knife.  Oh, ow! 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, that'll hurt.  Is that what somebody says when they want you to hand them a pipe?  Pipe?  Oh, my God.  Oh, do you have the Pendulet list all set?  Just trying to help.  Yeah, I have the Pendulet list.  All right, you guys ready for the Pendulet list? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Enough about Trace Adkins.  All right, the Pendulet list.  Here's the Pendulet list.  Okay.  His parents are dead.  He might be a Jew.  Ah.  That's all we know.  That's all we really know about why he would, you know, get votes.  Of course he would put sea salt in his ice cream.  He better put sea salt.  He was real desperate.  And Trace knew, Trace knows he has this, so he's, like, throwing a bone to maple.  Yeah.  He's like, there's not enough macadamia nut awareness.  He knows people don't fucking give a shit about maple. 
[02:31:00]  He's trying to help out the maple people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm helping the maple industry.  Right.  Because I already know I got this in the bag.  Hi, I'm Trace Adkins for the American Maple Association.  Yeah.  Let's play some Trace Adkins in the break.  You want to play the one we started?  Someone was saying we should play Arlington?  We'll do Honky Tonk, but Donka Donk.  Arlington.  Oh, boy.  Honky Tonk, but Donka Donk.  I don't know what that means.  It's a Honky Tonk, but Donka Donk. 
[02:31:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  You like that?  No.  It's terrible.  Bruce has something on Pendulet.  Hi, Bruce.  I appreciate it.  We've got to be fair.  We're trying to build the Pendulet list.  Yes, Bruce.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Calling from the highway in Maryland.  Good for you.  And I've got something on Pendulet's side of the list.  Yeah.  Well, a few years ago on a television show, they did a walkthrough of Pendulet's home,  and he's got his own personal sex dungeon. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, God.  You know what?  Add it to the list, Sam.  You never know what America's into.  Traces a house burned down.  That's not good.  And Penn has a sex dungeon.  Middle America will not appreciate.  He plays in a jazz trio.  Oh, jazz.  Oh, God.  I know.  That's right.  He does.  Before he shows.  He plays the stand-up bass, right?  He warms up his own fucking show with a three-piece.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Ron in Wisconsin.  Ron.  Yeah, you need to listen to the song Arlington.  It's a real support for the troops and the tearjerker. 
[02:32:30]  Check that out.  Like a good dickjerker.  Do you know what Arlington or the one we were playing?  Let's try Arlington.  No, not that one, Sam.  Let's try Arlington going into break.  Fuck it.  You got that.  He rocks.  Yeah, I have that one.  Do you want me to give you the updated Pendulet list?  Yes, please, Sam.  He might be a Jew.  His parents are dead.  He has a sex dungeon.  Yes.  He's sunk.  He is so sunk.  Where can we bet on this?  This is an easy win.  Yeah.  He might be a Jew. 
[02:33:00]  He might be a Jew.  And I believe we're friends with Pendulet, officially.  Oh, yeah.  But we have to bet against him.  He was very nice to my sister, Dawny.  And he remembered.  We want Pendulet to win.  We do.  We're just looking at the facts.  You know, the one thing we got to add to the Pendulet list, that certainly is not going  to help him.  He's an outspoken atheist.  He thinks God's a clear.  He's so done.  Trace Atkins is all about, you know, God and country. 
[02:33:30]  God and country.  And here's an atheist with a sex dungeon.  Oh, God damn it.  I don't think nail polish, whatever the reason may be, is going to help him.  He wears nail polish on his pinky.  That's not going to help him.  Let's add that to the worst.  Ring finger.  Which finger is it?  Ring finger.  Ring finger.  That's for his mom, though.  That's a cool thing.  But people don't know that.  People don't know it.  They just see some fruity Jew with a fucking...  Yeah, sex dungeon.  Dressing up like a girl. 
[02:34:00]  A six-foot-eight Jew with a nail polish on one finger.  I don't even know what Penn is.  I assume...  He's a Jew, obviously.  I don't know if he's Jewish.  No, he's atheist.  He couldn't be Jewish.  Yeah, I don't know what he was born.  I forgot.  I'm quite sure he was not born Jewish.  Might be a Jew.  Should we change it to might be a Jew, just to be fair?  No, that's what the list is.  He might be a Jew.  Might be.  This is what the American public sees.  Yes, yes.  And the American public is thinking that he's probably a Jew. 
[02:34:30]  Probably.  All right, let's do the final list.  Okay.  Go with Trace Adkins first.  Trace Adkins.  Uh-huh.  He was shot in the heart, but he didn't press charges against his ex-wife who shot him.  Does anyone else understand how fucking cool that is?  That's crazy.  His house burned down.  Right.  But his kids survived because they had a fire plan.  Yeah.  He helps the Wounded Warrior Project.  Mm-hmm.  He sells bulldozers.  Yeah, that's American.  His finger's been amputated, but he keeps trying. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  He has a wonderful voice.  He does.  He's selling ice cream for the American Red Cross.  That's nice.  He used to be an oil rig worker.  Mm-hmm.  Don't forget about the explosion.  He gave...  Oh, what was...  Survived an...  In 1983.  Yeah.  He survived an oil tank explosion while trying to repair a leak.  Don't forget to put that in.  Yeah.  Who survives an oil tank...  And how did he hurt his finger, Yorok? 
[02:35:30]  I don't know.  We'll have to listen later.  Okay.  I have something for Penn's list, too.  You have something for Penn's list?  Penn doesn't drink.  He's not a beer drinker.  That's not good.  America respects that, right?  Love a good drinker.  Holy fuck.  Okay.  He used to be an oil rig worker.  He survived an oil rig explosion in 1983.  He gave money given to him for a new house to charity.  Right.  He has billionaire friends. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  He's not afraid to have a little fun.  Right.  And his brother died when his brother was 21.  And so Trace dedicated his first album to him.  You forgot about the head-on collision with a bus.  Head-on collision.  As a teenager.  With a bus.  As a teen.  Teen.  Teen.  And what about the thing with his legs?  I thought some of that stuff started to get undocumented.  The bulldozer almost taking his ass cheeks off?  Right.  Oh, right.  Yeah, it was his ass cheeks, officially, right?  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Unofficially, because I don't think we have a...  All right.  Any proof of that?  But I will add that.  When he was a teen, he was in a head-on collision with a bus.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Right here.  Fact coming in.  Yeah.  Trace Adkins is actually the Navy SEAL who killed Bin Laden.  Oh, man.  Who knew that?  All right.  And then do you want to hear the Penn final list?  Yes, please.  Okay.  The final list for Penn.  He might be a Jew.  His parents are dead.  He has a sex dungeon.  And he's an outspoken atheist who wears nail polish. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, God.  The country is not going to take it.  No.  Middle America does not fucking relate to this.  No.  Hold on.  I am trying to move on here, but there's an actual website.  Oh.  Just...  Yeah.  It's real.  Okay.  13 country artists with bad luck.  And one of them is Trace Adkins.  It's one through nine.  It's on a website called tasteofcountry.com.  And then you'll get to the Trace Adkins, I guess. 
[02:37:30]  I want to thank QuickRNU on Twitter for sending us this.  There it is.  What does it say?  All right.  Do we have all...  There might be some more nuggets in here.  There actually are a couple more nuggets.  Okay.  Trace Adkins has been shot by his wife.  Okay.  He had his pinky finger cut off.  Had his nose ripped off in a car accident.  It was sewn back on.  We didn't hear about that.  Had his house burned down.  His nose was ripped off?  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  And been involved...  So was mine by Pinocchio, Robin. 
[02:38:00]  Get it?  I have a big nose.  Yeah.  And been involved in multiple tractor accidents.  Multiple?  Who gets in one tractor accident?  Who gets back in a tractor after being in a tractor accident?  Multiple.  Okay.  I got to add the nose thing.  Yeah.  His nose was ripped off.  You don't leave out having your nose ripped off.  How do you keep a fish from smelling?  How?  Cough his nose.  It's not funny, Chip.  It's a terrible old joke that children tell. 
[02:38:30]  Let's play Arlington and it's a break.  It's about the Arlington Cemetery by Trace Adkins.  Is that a good joke?  No.  I think we made our point here today.  Trace Adkins sings songs about the Arlington Cemetery.  Right.  And Penn Jillette does the bullet trick.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the bullet trick is very impressive.  It's impressive.  It is impressive.  It's not exactly a tearjerker. 
[02:39:00]  Trace Adkins never fucking took a picture of my sister.  He had his nose ripped off.  True.  Is it true?  Penn was in a Run DMC video?  That's not bad.  Yeah.  The middle of the market was like that.  The interaction with the blacks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What a downer Chip is.  Oh, my God. 
[02:39:30]  Penn's creepy.  I didn't know this about Penn.  Rick in El Paso.  Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Penn actually owns a piece of flesh with a tattoo on it that was taken from the stabber  of a murderer after his execution.  What?  Jesus.  What?  He's got a piece of flesh that has a tattoo on it from a murderer after his execution.  It was basically filleted off him and put in a frame.  Why did he want that? 
[02:40:00]  Well, it's fucking Penn Jillette.  Come on.  But was it a famous murderer?  I'm not sure.  During the interview, he wasn't even sure he was supposed to have it.  But he said, look, look what I got.  Yeah, it doesn't sound like something you should be allowed to have.  Right, right.  All right.  We could add it to the list, though.  That's for sure.  Wow.  That's not good for him.  Yes.  I even know the case of the killer, actually.  It was a murderer.  Too far over here.  No.  But it was a very famous serial killer. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Who was it?  His name was the Jocularity Killer.  He would laugh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  O.J.  Killed his victims.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jerry.  All right.  We're done.  Trace Adkins.  Not done with the show.  Done with this, I guess.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  I hope people vote for Penn Jillite, but...  There's no voting.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  Just buy his fucking ice cream.  He needs all the help he can get.  He's got a sex dungeon.  True.  Yeah, me too.  Let's play Arlington.  People are saying we should play Arlington by Trace Adkins. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  We'll go to break with this.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I never thought that this is where I'd settle down.  I thought I'd die an old man back in my hometown.  They gave me this plot of land. 
[02:41:30]  Me and some other men for a job well done.  There's a big white house.  It's on a hill just up the road.  The man inside.  He cried, he cried, he cried the day they brought me home.  They folded up a flag and told my mom and dad, we're proud of your son.  And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property. 
[02:42:00]  I'm on sacred ground.  I'm on sacred ground.  I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done.  I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done.  I can rest in peace.  I'm one of the chosen ones.  I made it to Arlington.  I made it to Arlington.  I made it to Arlington.  I remember daddy brought me here when I was eight. 
[02:42:30]  I made it to Arlington.  I made it to Arlington.  I made it to Arlington.  All day to find out where my granddad lay.  And when we finally found that cross, he said, son, this is what it costs to keep us free.  Now here I am a thousand stones away from him. 
[02:43:00]  He recognized me on the first day I came in.  And it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels and saluted me.  I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property.  I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of companies.  And I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done. 
[02:43:30]  I can rest in peace.  I'm one of the chosen ones.  I made it to Arlington.  And every time I hear 21 guns, I know they've brought another hero home to us. 
[02:44:00]  We're thankful for those thankful for the things we've done.  We can rest in peace.  We are the chosen ones.  We made it to Arlington. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, dust to dust.  Don't cry for us.  We made it to Arlington.  Arlington.  After these messages, We'll be right back.

[02:55:00]  daltrey yeah i had no clue that he was in the studio yesterday i forgot to tell you guys what  i was uh walking across central park to go get a haircut and i actually ran into roger daltrey i  forgot to tell you central park uh actually before central park like central park west area all right  and i i once again put myself out there i was excited i'm like holy fuck that's roger daltrey 
[02:55:30]  had a hat and sunglasses on was walking with a gentleman he's even shorter when he's out in  public by the way yeah yeah and i made the mistake of saying hey it's opie from opie and anthony  you were on our show this morning there was no recognition in his face what did he say just  talked to him a mere three hours earlier that's why i always get the picture it was more of a just  yeah yeah you know one of those oh yeah okay and then kept walking oh like he didn't even hear  what i was saying in that split second did you have a cut fantasy where you're like go from that 
[02:56:00]  moment to you and him are in your apartment so and then look and then so when we left woodstock  we're flying back to london and you're just like can i get you another you know whatever but it's  amazing you guys think at 20 hours a week for us to write a song it takes a long time stop looking at  me little hands but what happens to these people i can't play i can't sing for the who this weekend  it's impossible it's impossible but what happens to these people after they leave here amnesia 
[02:56:30]  they i don't know i i get it i'm not expecting whoa did he stop and shake your hand did this like  like just oh hello yes yes thank you for something in his eyes like oh that's right yeah i was on your  show this morning that's all i'm not expecting anything he was yeah yeah pretty much he slowed down  slightly and i was just and and then i stopped talking and i just like oh and now i started you 
[02:57:00]  feel right when you walked away heating up heating up why do i do this we all do it but we were on the  same sidewalk i had to say something i was walking right into him yeah president obama was with him  he was leaving too but what happens to these guys i don't know dude i'm not expecting the big invite  if the who get together again and perform i just wanted a little acknowledgement you were just on  our show so fucking weird go into the studio you can tell us if we're doing good right oh okay roger 
[02:57:30]  but i made it easy too i didn't like expect him to recognize me because he was on our show i said hi  opi opi anthony you're on our show this morning that was fun i mean there was nothing really audible  that i could even say it was just a kind of a nod like oh yeah and then just kept walking by me  it just that sounds exactly like hi it's anthony opi and anthony show i'm good friends with adam  ferrara right you know on your show with you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know what 
[02:58:00]  happens it's so embarrassing but i've also been on the other side where someone tries to tell you  that they know yeah i was with so-and-so last night and it's a person i know and i just don't give a  but you don't acknowledge them no i'll acknowledge them but i just don't care i'll be like i i've  figured out because i used to try to just fake it and be like no yeah yeah yeah right i go like  i'm sorry i go i meet so many people i see so many fucking people well i'm so famous i don't even  know what i you know i'm at i don't know what to expect what were you expecting just anything a 
[02:58:30]  twinkle of acknowledgement yeah that's it seriously that's it just just a slight like oh yeah that you  know oh yeah that was fun even if you know it wasn't any other annoying guy that recognized them  walking down the street oh yeah yeah no i was i was just oh i blend in with everybody else that was  just trying to get his attention as he's walking time can you hear me so fucking weird  does he sing that yeah oh god yeah oh tommy i think he meant uh major tom me 
[02:59:00]  yeah roger daltrey that's why there's never a bond with these people it's it's it's bullshit sign  this let's take a picture thanks because the bond is non-existent how do people become friends  with celebrities in the celebrity world you have to talk to them a few times probably who knows  you talk to them for a while i think even those guys that like uh you know get further than we do  it's all fake yeah i don't i mean like real i don't think they have real meaningful how do you 
[02:59:30]  get real friends in general i wouldn't know with celebrities i mean oh fuck yeah pen pen's a guy i  told you what me and my ex went to see they're like oh yeah pen would like to take you to dinner  and we actually had dinner with him before the show like he was legitimately exactly the way he said  he was if you invested more time in that you'd probably be friends with him well i am friendly  with pen we texted me no you're on your way though is what i'm saying pen which is rare like i said  there's only been a couple occasions for i can see the kind of friend i just don't see him because 
[03:00:00]  of where he lives but he's a guy a friend to somebody you can fucking like shut up you fucking  asshole right that's your friend you can't really i'd feel uncomfortable saying that to like anybody  stop being a faggot yeah hey pen don't be a faggot right that's a thing saggot's a friend bob saggot's  a friend i don't see him i said that yesterday he absolutely is yeah but it's very rare  but even in frame we were just talking about this and it happened yesterday yes see we were  just talking i wasn't assuming anything i gave him all the info it's everything he needed to know 
[03:00:30]  it's just humiliating hi uh you should have shown him you showed you should have showed him the  picture of you two on your phone hey look well this just happened i fucking hate my picture with  roger daltry so yeah uh you're not too far off i was hoping like maybe if there was any of it  then i go hey man can we get a you know quick pic out there on the street would have been bad though  no one was around it was a side street i mean there was no one around i wasn't blowing up his  spot at all no do you think people recognize him every day though when he walks around i was thinking 
[03:01:00]  about that because when he was walking toward me like man i don't know if i would recognize that  was roger daltry unless he was on our show today yeah he just goes around spinning a microphone  all right walking through yeah like he's on stage at something chip because i never expected him to  be so short that's why i don't think i would have recognized him he is short he's very short i can  start smacking chip on the back of the hand do you think chip just takes thunder oh chip knows how to 
[03:01:30]  take thunder and turn it into a a fart anyway that was my dumb little story from yesterday  believe me i've been on there right oh my god oh yeah i usually remember i usually avoid it though  i told you kevin bacon saw me at the improv perform and shook my hand on the way i headlined  yeah and uh then i saw him here and said hello took a picture together  no recognition whatsoever it's like you watched me for 40 minutes  oh my god yeah you made him react he went home thinking of you and some of the stuff you said 
[03:02:00]  but he didn't didn't even acknowledge him like that oh god why the sharp the sharp drop off  in the podcast graph well you have to understand i mean the moment that it comes out will be the  peak moment okay because everybody you know people who subscribe and then okay that's all  that is i mean that's still a nice uh still a nice number even at the low point on the graph 
[03:02:30]  yeah yeah i'll see about that where's the total number it is for the episode it's this one  really two billion three million pretty good is that good i think so does it grow from there then too  yeah it's a lot better than mine oh well you're you know you true that yeah no that's a that's a  very uh it's a very nice number i think what do you guys want to do i think it will grow from that

[03:07:00]  how about we play the ryan lochte clips to entertain the audience oh i mean to entertain  uh the audience that's it sam roberts uh where is that taken why is your name up on the little  bulletin board thing that's a little photoshop magic  clever boy it doesn't look very good you should use some drop shadow on there to make it look like  yeah i don't know how to do photoshop actual uh sign yeah i don't know how to do that stuff i'm the  master of photoshop and after effects i just saw there was a piece of cardboard there so i colored 
[03:07:30]  it in brown and then added text over it by the way you know what they're doing at adobe software  there's fucking uh i got the newest version six of after effects last night you don't shut up  you used to buy the fucking software and then you install it and there you have it right uh i guess  with the advent of thievery that's going on because now no one was buying photoshop anymore no one's  buying after effects right all of adobe software was up on torrent sites to be downloaded by whoever 
[03:08:00]  the fuck so they got a brand new fucking feature oh you you buy the software for a monthly fee that  you continue to pay as long as you fucking use it so for 29 bucks a month you have after effects uh  six a month a month how much is it to own it outright it's like what could be upwards of thousand  something dollars wow yeah yeah yeah it's very very expensive software so you you do this and 
[03:08:30]  then they charge you a monthly fee uh and you download it from their site and then i guess if  you cancel or don't pay for it they fucking discontinue your ability to use it anymore so  they kind of figured out how you can't just steal the software good for them fucking uh pretty amazing  they gotta get paid a little 1800 bucks for the full suite which is software it's it's photoshop for  video it's it's an amazing but wouldn't one guy take the 1800 uh buy the whole thing for 1800 and 
[03:09:00]  then put it up on a torrent site uh you can't you can't but if you buy it outright how are they  protecting against that you don't buy it outright anymore that's just it but someone said 1800 bucks  i guess that's what it went for i can't buy i would i was looking to buy it out so officially you  cannot buy it out yeah i was looking to buy an upgrade last night from my 5.5 to 6.0 but uh i  couldn't find it so i had to do this fucking what's it called it uh after effects and that's  good for mac video uh yeah mac it works uh it works great on my mac i i and and it works great with um 
[03:09:30]  with uh uh fucking photoshop is it better than i movie you could do it's a totally different animal  for i movie you could take fucking work parts from photoshop import it right into after effects  and then manipulate them in 3d space so you could have like a photoshop logo and have that logo  spin in 3d space and and kind of move you could have it in various layers where you ever see uh they  kind of do it nowadays where they do a documentary with still footage and the the people are moving 
[03:10:00]  in front of a slightly right field of uh depth of field blurry background you could do that with  the level layers in after effects and you can cut video too yeah it's not made for mostly for video  editing that's more final cut pro it's to incorporate so you use it alongside final cut  yeah yeah once you get all your work parts that you've made in after effects you import them into  final cut pro and and put them all together but it's more like photoshop for video you you can it 
[03:10:30]  incorporates into photoshop too amazingly c6 yes the best i take i take shit from photoshop with an alpha  channel you just pull it right over to after effects incorporate it like a logo into video and it's  just right the fuck there no you know this file doesn't match you got and then yeah yeah it's  it fucking works great though if you want if you want an upgrade for my movie you need to get final  cut okay just or if you just want to cut video and stuff yeah if i want to make edit videos i'm 
[03:11:00]  finally going to final cut you have to pop-locking final cut is i do like i movie though it's very  easy yeah it's easy but final cut pro i didn't know how to make it i would drop a movie in there  and be like new project work on new project i'm like what am i doing all right maybe we can't figure  out i movie we don't want to jump to final cut pro is a long arduous learning curve what am i doing  what am i doing new file new file i didn't know how to do it i kept going the wrong one oh jimmy i was  fucking maybe we'll spend some time mastering i movie and then you go out of final cut pro into 
[03:11:30]  compressor and they give you a bunch of different options of what format you want your video in  you could cut down the size of a file and make it look great still i was always like ah this file's  giant but i put it in a compression and it fucking sucks with compressor holy fuck they got such adobe's  fucking got great software and fucking uh apple's got great software fucking great great great yeah  great great great that's all i use the guy on line three i forgot about that too adobe has cloud 
[03:12:00]  service now yes the cloud i signed up for that last night well it's the puffy things that uh look so  pretty in the sky yeah you work up in the clouds i gotta work on the job site it's like anything else  oh boy it's like anything else these days and and all these cloud things are pretty funny it's so  funny uh people when it's called cloud they have no problem putting all their shit on it but when it  was just called a company's server yeah you were like ah i don't like that well i don't want my 
[03:12:30]  pictures there and i don't want my fucking this there and that but it's on a cloud oh it's a cloud  oh i'll put all my fucking shit up on a cloud who doesn't want to hang out on a cloud sounds great  there's tax services that have cloud features now it's like hey put your forms right up here  i'm not putting it on a server right it's a cloud right oh okay it's a cloud nobody's actually  gonna save the dead it'll just be in the cloud it's in a cloud somewhere nobody's gonna get to 
[03:13:00]  it all your personal pictures i don't want them i don't know if people can take it off of that they  can't take it off a cloud unless you're in a plane right oh yeah cloud all right let's get jimmy out  here yeah jimmy's got a flight to jacksonville i'm going to jackson don't lay your money down  i'm going to jackson i'm gonna download some trace atkins today i think why would you say it  at least wait till monday all right man because we're trying to promote pen jillette he turned me 
[03:13:30]  around fuck trace atkins well at least go to youtube and i'll listen to a couple songs and then i'll  forget about it by tomorrow that's the way to do it spotify or something yeah little spotify  or you could just turn on whatever country music channel on sirius xm and listen to trace atkins oh  look at that now you're doing a denny thing cross-promoting other platforms here on sirius  xm satellite radio that means having control of my xm unit in my house you do not have that control 
[03:14:00]  no my my son figured out how to fucking turn it on until your son wow so now his new thing is he  goes daddy you like this channel i go yeah i do and then he gets off he gets he stops what he's  doing and goes to the fucking thing and then changes the channel then he goes daddy do you like  this channel and i go yeah i do because they're all he's in the rock genre uh-huh but he will not  keep it on one what happens if you say no i don't it doesn't matter he just changes it again and then 
[03:14:30]  it eventually gets those stupid fucking traffic channels i just want him to stop playing with the  fucking thing oh so kids get it they fucking are annoying as hell  they get something in their head and they will not stop repetition so i can't long story short i  can't keep my xm on one channel for more than probably 30 seconds you gotta yell i know i know  more about the service now because hit them and make them cry that worked for me i know more about 
[03:15:00]  the service because of my son now yeah because we went through and one day it had to be 50 channels  i'm like oh wow they got a lot of a variety on this thing they got everything you like this channel  that's just that yeah click but we go through it yes i do but i guess that's not a good enough  answer now is it uh do you like that yes i do just oh my god jimmy have fun in jacksonville oh yes go

[03:19:00]  all right after opian anthony live is the name of the show that's the name of the show  my name is sam roberts i don't know your name but i do know that you can call 866 wow one wow  at any point and tell me what you're thinking tell me what you learned today on the opian anthony 
[03:19:30]  show uh podcast is doing it was very cool to have uh pendulet in studio pendulet's one of those  there's a handful of guys that i will always be excited about having in studio no matter how many  times they're in it's never not good news when you wake up in the morning and okay this is going  to be good pendulet's coming in he's one of the guys he's never had a bad appearance on  the show he's just always interesting and i was talking to travis about it in the office he's one 
[03:20:00]  of the few people that not only is he always interesting but he can come on and not just  talk about what he's talking about he can talk about whatever is going on and be interesting  you know i mean like a lot of people can talk and they have sort of specialties where they can go  and if you're going in that direction there's only one guy to talk to but pendulet's one of the few  people that you know if atheism never comes up then it never comes up he still has things that 
[03:20:30]  he can talk about that he's passionate about and he can hang with any conversation it's quite amazing  303 you're on after opian anthony live i'd like to play a little what did i learn today sam all right  what i learned was you can't make a list for shit why is that because they had to keep going over  the the points on the list half a dozen different times before you actually well trace atkins had a  lot of fucking shit happen to him and i was working on the list at the same time as facts were rolling  in plus plus i had to fact check all the people that were calling up because believe it or not 
[03:21:00]  sometimes you guys call the show with erroneous information sometimes always call with erroneous  information for instance this call was erroneous because your point is incorrect  he got served just now didn't he eroc he did thanks 734 you're on after opian anthony live  sam i am roberts how you doing today sir i'm great how are you it's snowy um snowy 
[03:21:30]  i found out something today about trace atkins that that list you made could be an old country  music song that guy's whole life you know this old song my wife left me i mean i i figured i cut  off my nose it up my wife you know shot me my house burned down yeah i don't know what he's doing  he doesn't need to make songs about anyone else other than him i know man i'm not a big country  music fan that's like the old joke about country music song how my wife left me 
[03:22:00]  yeah i mean he he maybe i i don't know maybe he walks into tragedy on purpose so it gives him some  more material i don't know for sure you know another thing you could have added i i thought  about calling in adding something for uh pendulet's list but you mentioned atheists because that one  book god no i mean it kind of goes along with the atheist thing but uh yeah that's something that's  kind of a strike against somebody read that he wrote a book called god no plus there's a lot of people  there's a lot of people in the country that when they find out that pendulet had a book denouncing 
[03:22:30]  god they will still assume he's jewish so he must be jewish i'll talk to you later snowy  take care of the fam 631 you're on after open anthony live hi sam what's up buddy i want to play what  did you learn what did you learn i learned that you think it's hilarious when a marine has his legs  blown off introducing a trace atkinson did you tweet me yes i did okay this i'm glad you called in  because that was i wanted to even address that because that tweet it made no sense i don't 
[03:23:00]  understand when people tweet what on earth you're listening to did you hear the the the the piece  of show today when what we were talking about yes and i heard you so oh look there's a soldier with  no leg right you heard that the whole premise of what we were talking about was oh my god the deck  is stacked against pendulet you heard that right right so do you think that maybe what was being  laughed at there was the fact that trace atkins keeps being a better person a couple other people 
[03:23:30]  that agreed with me as well and said wow he really did just laugh at a guy with his legs blown off you  think that what i was laughing at was i thought it was funny that what's funny about that what's funny  about it you tell me you're the one that chuckled at it the the funny part was this pendulet has the  odds stacked against him because trace atkins is a wonderful man and he keeps doing better things  like oh just when you thought trace atkins couldn't do more for humanity he's done this 
[03:24:00]  he keeps going above and beyond he keeps proving himself to be a better person that's hilarious  right that's is that just an okay or is that an apology not apology you think maybe you were  incorrect no that maybe there's a thing where for some reason you guys are on twitter and and there's  a a group of you that just feels like we have to have a problem with something no because you know  what i've never had a problem with anything you've ever done before now then why would you think that 
[03:24:30]  i'm the type of person that would laugh at a soldier who lost his legs because you did it today on the  show do you think that maybe you were incorrect about what i was laughing at do you think that  what i just think you don't think my explanation makes sense i yeah okay you have an explanation  that's fine and well but you know what the fact is you still said look oh there's a soldier with  his legs blown off first of all it was a marine get it right but now do you when we when we were  laughing that trace atkins family survived a house being on fire were we laughing at the fire 
[03:25:00]  oh jesus when i laughed at trace atkins got shot by his wife am i laughing because haha look how funny  that is somebody was shot all right you think that maybe i was laughing at something else  if you were you were okay but it came off as a little uh a little pompous it didn't come off as  pompous because you're obviously obviously i've explained to you the context of what the chuckle came 
[03:25:30]  from i'm not gonna laugh i have friends that are in the military i'm not gonna laugh at a marine  who lost his legs i don't even understand how somebody could even if somebody was just  a little shit i don't understand how there could be humor found in that uh well i don't know it came  off that way that's my observation i want you to know you were wrong all right whatever goodbye  it's just weirdness everybody's got to have a problem on twitter there's this new thing too  on twitter where where people they love starting fights and like there's i don't know if it's 
[03:26:00]  because they have like little there are little clicks that hang out on twitter for the most part  i love twitter because people generally say great things and they're like oh i like to hear uh  that you said this i like the i downloaded your podcast i went to your website i saw your video this  is awesome this is great but then there's there's this whole thing that's happening where some people  feel like they need to start a fight over nothing like that guy just now if you had actually thought 
[03:26:30]  about it yeah i don't know if for some reason you feel like you need to be mad about something  and that makes you feel like you have a cause like oh i found something to be mad about this will  legitimize you know what i'm feeling i can be outraged about something when there was nothing to  be outraged about like for instance i go on uh uh uh covino and richie's show a couple weeks ago  when ona were talking about them and i say they somebody asked me about pete dominic and they said 
[03:27:00]  yeah when a caller was calling up to ona and complimenting you guys covino and rich go is that  right and i go yeah somebody called up and said uh covino and rich are the only thing funny on the  channel and the caller said that uh pete dominic doesn't know how to be funny and that's what it  was and then you got this one little rat who's on twitter who's just trying to start a conflict  just because i don't know why who starts at mentioning pete dominic who does the morning show 
[03:27:30]  on indie who i wasn't i don't have anything against pete dominic but he asked but but what do you  mean he asked what did sam say he goes what the fuck is somebody's talking shit about me right and  i understand that because he should because if you think somebody's talking shit let's get to the  bottom of it so now this guy who wasn't listening to the segment just like the guy who thinks i'm  laughing at military people who are injured which is preposterous now you missed it roland before you 
[03:28:00]  walked in some guy called in and thought when i was laughing because trace atkins keeps doing good  things and that it makes pendulet's life more difficult to win this competition he thought i  was laughing because there was a uh but they forget though why you have your headphones on looking for  another clip you're laughing at the clip but you're not hearing what the guys are saying i i i i don't  know what he thought he heard but it's the same thing now i got some little douchebag who's tweeting  at pete dominic hey at pete dominic at not sam is talking shit about you on covino and rich's show 
[03:28:30]  i'm going where does that even come from it's one thing i don't have a problem if i go on the air  and i talk for instance when i was talking shit about guy fieri you converted him right but i don't  care if people are tweeting guy fieri and saying hey sam's talking shit about you when the scorch  stuff comes up and people are tweeting scorch and saying sam betrayed you i hate it when it happens  because i'm like i feel bad but i'm not mad at the people doing it on twitter because it's like okay  i did kind of go on the air and do this but when it's not happening when you're just starting 
[03:29:00]  trouble for the sake of causing trouble it perplexes me so now and now there's this whole  back and forth thing and pete dominic tweets is that true sam and i'm tweeting to pete dominic no dude i  just said what a caller said i was conveying like he's lying right and nobody knows to the point where  like it takes an hour finally pete dominic i guess he heard a clip of the show and he goes okay  sorry i made such a big deal about this and i'm like no problem because then on friday 
[03:29:30]  the same thing happens again i'm just sitting there i'm driving home i get home scroll through  my twitter hey sam jason ellis is talking shit about you i go huh jay why would jason ellis be  talking shit about me we haven't had any interaction in so long and i go i tweeted to that guy and to  jason ellis well what did he say is that true and the guy was like yeah he said you were like a radio  nerd and i was like well if that's all jason ellis said i don't need a tattletale coming to me 
[03:30:00]  and letting me know what somebody said and to me with my perbiglia i was walking in the village  and i ran into me hey can i talk to you for a minute hey how what's up he goes uh someone told  me uh you were talking shit and say i was a fucking asshole like whoa i go i never because i got drunk  and i mentioned your name because oh yeah because you always get drunk i'm like yeah right and that's  it and i told him i go whoever said it i go i loved your movie and i see you do stand-up all the  time he goes yeah i was wondering why i was like i didn't say anything because i don't believe it 
[03:30:30]  bothered him a lot of course it bothered and the same way if somebody tweeted you and said hey roland  sam's talking shit about you you'd be like why the fuck is sam talking yeah you'd be like he usually  does it to my face and someone goes yeah you suck at vine i'm like and i tweet i tweet back i know  but so i'm sitting there going like i'm tweeting like what's the deal and some guys tweet and then  another ellis fan goes no he didn't talk shit and everybody's arguing i'm like why what's the  problem here what started this ellis tweets me and goes dude it's all good i was just i talked about 
[03:31:00]  you but it was all respect i got the clip this is what we had to stop the presses for and alert me  of this is jason ellis from his show they have this other dude i don't think he likes me i don't really  like him either actually i guess i should get over that that one sam dude he's just like it sounds  annoying to me or something but i don't mind anything that's been said so far but don't pretend  you don't know my name this one like uh sam dude i think his name i think his name is sam like yeah 
[03:31:30]  you know what my name is he fucking tries he's one of those people again that whether you whether  he's your style or not he fucking gives a shit about radio so i'm it's always a weird thing for me to  like people that are similar to me at my at my game so like you know how jake ellenberger says he  doesn't like people in his weight class yes it's kind of like that like i don't if you have too much  in common with me on the radio and you want to excel in the in the in the business well then i find  it very difficult to like you because that means you're trying to come at me right right and i and 
[03:32:00]  i don't and you're not you're not coming at me i'm gonna beat you every time i'm gonna beat you  so i heard the clip and somebody is tweeting me saying oh people are talking shit about you you  gotta hear this clip and i listen to that and it's complimentary in his way at the end of the day  like what what ellis just said there was i'm annoyed by sam but the truth of the matter is sam busts his 
[03:32:30]  ass he tries and i get mad when people also try at radio he said just there that i i whether you  like me or not i work hard at this and that he doesn't like it when other people are trying to  work as hard as he is doing what he does because you know then it like gets competitive and i understand  that he calls you up here right like they were exactly i listen to that i'm like okay that's his  way of being like yo we're cool but i still feel competitive which i understand because i get 
[03:33:00]  competitive too i mean you know i'm friends with most of the people who do shows here but in my soul  of souls i hate most of the people who do shows here not like opie and anthony or howard stern or my  buddy who's walking in dj who kid because opie and anthony and stern are established for something else and  who kid and me are probably on different career paths but that said like don't start twitter beef 
[03:33:30]  over this nonsense you know what i mean because he's saying that we're i i feel the same way as  ellis does about that that you know when when you want something you get competitive about it  like i look around at the people who do shows on sirius xm and think you know why the fuck would  anybody let that person on the air aside from howard stern aside from opie and anthony aside  from who kid aside from ron and fez the people who were kind of born and raised on sirius xm  all of them every show why the fuck would anybody put those guys on the air why am i not where they 
[03:34:00]  you know why am i not where they are or why is anybody paying attention to them at all even if i get  more attention paid to me than they get attention paid to them i'm still sitting there going why aren't  i the one getting that attention it's i'll get into what roland's laughing at in a moment who kid's  getting costumes for his appearance but you know you go even if and it's an unhealthy thing because  it's jealousy but even if you're doing better than somebody you still look at them like oh 
[03:34:30]  they have something i feel like if they have something i don't have something it's not true  and it's not a healthy way to be but it doesn't mean that i need little rats on twitter you know so  somebody's talking shit about you oh you were just talking shit about somebody else when none of it's  true you just want a little you want a little attention you want to start a fight tell them why  you're mad god damn it tell them why you're mad you wonder why i'm mad because who kid you know i'm 
[03:35:00]  the nigger spock today what who could i'm gonna i don't know if i can even describe what's going on  here dj who could just walked in i'm the nigger spock i'm gonna take a photo of you okay throw up  the the little vulcan thing can you do that you can throw up you can throw up gang signs but you can't  do a vulcan thing do your best move that footlocker bag out of the way none of that cross-promotion  bullshit this is the west side and uh all right i'm putting this up on instagram right now not sam

[03:38:30]  the twitter page right now to look at what what your kid looks like right now it's the most insane  thing i've ever seen i don't know he's got the little star trek pin on and everything you could  be the space hippie why i'm be the space hippie i'm not doing your little star trek sexual role  playing game star trek you look like a space hippie let me go to rob in indianapolis what's up rob  what no that's how's it going it's good it's going what's up i was uh really just kind of  calling about that guy that was uh got some uh sand is a vagina about you left when he thought it 
[03:39:00]  was about the the uh the soldier but then also just listen to you further kind of laughing about  how some of that stuff on twitter is just kind of like the the stuff in high school when you know  like you want to get two guys in a fight and you just keep saying you know yeah did you hear that  you gotta put up with that right it's just a weasel thing to do and there's a very  different way of my weasel dumb because people will probably say sam you're the biggest weasel  there is you've started more fights than anybody but the difference is when i start shit it's based 
[03:39:30]  on something that's actually happened what you called you pussy or something no nobody called me  pussy nobody would have the nerve i'm about to say but when i start shit it's like when i say oh he  said this it actually happened like i'm never going to be like oh somebody's talking shit about you  and they're not talking shit okay because that's some pussy shit that's some rat  it's easy it's easy to talk shit too when you're not in front of someone so it's kind of the same  thing because you're not you know even in high school you weren't the one getting in a fight  but you could watch a fight so i could watch a fight thanks rob oh shit oh my god uh let's go to 
[03:40:00]  512 512 you're on the after show hey sammy i can't believe that fucking moron who called in and  who tweeted you why do these people listen i don't know you know why they listen because they love  to start conflicts there's something there's some there's some people they call and they tweet and  they they interact with the radio show because they like the radio show they like the people that are 
[03:40:30]  involved they want to support it they want to be a part of it they want to call in and but then  there's a whole other group point of the bit right you realize he listened to that whole bit and missed  the entire point by the way it was a brilliant fucking bit because the the country is divided  between these fucking uh you know corn-fed idiots and these like kind of like city people that know  what's up you know the whole thing who kid wasn't go like yeah the rubes are gonna love this  stupid trace atkins that was the whole thing that's the whole thing the whole what we were 
[03:41:00]  doing was we're talking about pendula thank you buddy we're talking about pendula and trace atkins  being in the finale of celebrity apprentice on the show today on a pen should win right and we while  we were talking about that because pen was in here and he's he's awesome on the show but we were  talking about the fact that pen has no chance because number one a lot of the country's probably  gonna assume he's jewish and number two trace atkins is like you know a country boy and we  went through this whole list he's spiritual too because you know pen is an atheist yeah but yeah 
[03:41:30]  trace atkins believes in another trace atkins believes in god in his country and we were going  through this whole list of every reason that people in the midwest and the large portions of the  country are going to love trace atkins and we're going through and we see like farmers his wife trace  atkins's wife shot him in the heart he survived and then he didn't press charges against his wife  he's pussy he was like okay you know we're divorcing you would shoot her i'll shoot the fuck out of her  you wouldn't press charges but you would shoot her okay you'd shoot your wife though i'll fuck her 
[03:42:00]  then put it in shooter okay then his family survives a house fire his house burns down his family survives  he gets money for a new house he donates that money to charity it's amazing the things he does  why don't you just buy a car like a nigga so then we're going over all this stuff and we're laughing  i don't know if that's get a mayback culturally relevant we're laughing because pendulet has no  chance people are calling up and being like you know pendulet has a sexual dungeon in his house 
[03:42:30]  and we're going how's he going to compete with trace atkins you know what i mean and so we're laughing  at how hopeless pendulet is at this thing then we find out that trace atkins has been one of the  most outspoken guy for the troops and the people are coming back and he comes on the cma awards the  country music association awards shit and to introduce him a marine who had his legs blown off  damn that's fucked up comes out to introduce trace atkins so i'm laughing because i'm like ha ha ha 
[03:43:00]  holy shit pendulet doesn't have a chance and then i got one asshole who's got to tweet me and then  call the show and be like yeah you really think it's funny laughing at marines who lost their legs  yeah that's fucked up and i'm going why i wasn't laughing at that that's not what i was laughing at  that's what got me into the whole thing about uh tell them why you're mad about people starting  shit on twitter for people who aren't talking shit funny thing to talk about you know you know in our 
[03:43:30]  world hip-hop world in our world we call that internet thugs internet thugs internet thugs all  need hugs right they need something because they're all on my case i need to get them out of my life  you know it was a misunderstanding and then he's just on your nutsack he's not and yeah and then i  got people saying oh sam's talking shit about this guy oh jason ellis is talking shit about sam  none of it's true none of it's true jason ellis i played the clip he had respect for me in that clip 
[03:44:00]  i appreciate that clip i listened to that clip i was like i wish more people talked to me in that  light people don't have to like me but that's a guy who respects what i do why don't we just  disappear and be my hand and go somewhere private because that's some weird sexual space shit that  you're on right now i think i think the wig and the shirt that you're wearing compressing your brain  the moisture enterprise oh no scotty's gonna be i don't want any part of that 409 you're on after  opening anthony live faggot i don't want any part of this go ahead 409 hey did y'all talk about uh 
[03:44:30]  trace atkins uh bulldozer tractor accident holy shit that's it we talked about all of it i mean he's  been through accidents he's been through everything everything so he's god's homeboy he's like god's  friend he's god's homeboy he goes to strip club with god and jesus jesus christ that's exactly what  i was talking about jesus 516 he had to get it in he had to get it in every time he was waiting on 
[03:45:00]  home for 20 minutes 864 that was hey this is mark in south carolina how are you sir what's up buddy  hey listen uh a little spoiler alert i work for walgreens and had an incident happen this morning  uh we were getting restocked uh for the freezer section and the ice creams and i saw cases in  cases of ice cream that said congratulations trace atkins on winning oh that's fucked up

[03:46:00]  he doesn't uh have the appeal that ken gillette does even though ken gillette is more honest and  forthcoming that's not cool thanks buddy i hope that all right buddy i hope that's not true why  would they promote that on ice cream though well the the whole deal with uh celebrity apprentice this  season is the end of it pendulette and trace atkins they each have an ice cream flavor  oh and one they have to one has to sell more ice cream than the other so pendulette was in here  today what flavor is it with some delicious ice cream it was lemony no it was no lemony that's 
[03:46:30]  some of that piss it was like r kelly surprise yipes no it was not piss flavored it was uh caramel and  chocolate and sea salt get the delicious no it's delicious reef you gotta give it a try you mix  chocolate with sea salt you'd be amazed i'm the one with the fucking star trek outfit you're eating  some space shit right now that's some shit from space yeah but your star trek thing is not so much  a space thing as it is a gay thing i think they said pen and trace are gonna be at the union square 
[03:47:00]  duane reed if you want to meet them okay so union square today duane reed 230 they'll both have their  ice cream they're gonna try to sway votes and trace's ice cream is uh macadamia nut no way maple  macadamia nut that could be good though because you have coconut and the sweetness and i don't know  could be good you you want to give it a try i think so all right you could taste the same you  should go crash the party and be like yo everybody just because pendulette has a sex dungeon doesn't 
[03:47:30]  mean he shouldn't be the apprentice no just be like the fight is fixed yeah yeah some guy called my radio  show and said the fight is fixed he didn't have any photos but i believe him you don't want to make  pen happy if you were like a fuck god t-shirt i don't know i don't know if that would do anything  to help his cause right now i don't know if he wants people showing up with shirts that say fuck  god that's gonna get people upset again who can then you get people calling in and saying sam doesn't  support the troops or god the troops i'll leave it alone but god you know you can wear a t-shirt like

[03:50:00]  because he doesn't believe in the devil oh yeah a lot i think the devil is wearing a star trek outfit  i think you might be satan right now to tell you the truth maybe he's a omnipotent or something  omnipotent that's a big word for you or omnipotent no omnipotent was the right way to pronounce  lonnie in north carolina that's the shit i was smoking hey sam i really think that uh pendulet and the  boys are really good friends you want to know why yeah i do well during the show pendulet is supposed

[03:56:00]  opie anthony podcast is just exploding across the internet right now uh lots of great tweets from  people coming in uh yesterday and overnight you had all the heavy hitters of podcast talking about  their friends opie and anthony because let's be honest a lot of the people who are podcasting  got a lot from opie anthony all the comedians that are podcasting you know they kind of learned  this whole style from opie and anthony you had uh bill burr sending in tweet and by the way they all 
[03:56:30]  do great podcasts now don't get me wrong but you had bill burr tweeting about this carolings  uh caroline's comedy club yeah i have no idea how you pull that one off rolling caroline's comedy  club uh christy stefano christy stefano my buddy from after opie anthony live burr kreischer  mark maron uh amy schumer jay moore uh tons of people eliza schlesinger well i don't even  she's been on the show once eliza schlesinger it's a sean f edmondo 2700 sean f is the one 
[03:57:00]  who's been doing this now uh troy you were tasked with putting together a commercial for the opie  anthony podcast correct yeah were you given kind of creative license on this thing yeah i mean basically  it was just kind of like you know hey we need to do this the guys want it just do what you got to do  you know so uh so that's what i did they said we need to get we need you to give us something that  will get the listeners ear yes that will get listeners to say whoa because a lot of promos 
[03:57:30]  when they run on on radio stations people don't don't even hear them they don't even  they're they don't even hit the ear pay no mind right because they're on the pay no mind list people  don't even realize what they're being advertised you need to make something that sets yourself apart  right and this is one of my favorite promos that that i've done in a while this is one of your  you do all the promos yeah from this for the channel at least that's what i meant yeah and  this is one of your favorites yeah in recent history i mean i like some of the dr steve ones 
[03:58:00]  where where i have uh people singing and stuff like that but uh this one was definitely uh and you  remember when i put it together yesterday i had you come back to the studio and we give it we just  kind of soaked in it for a little while because i really didn't know what clip to actually use  you know there was there were so many good uh gems all right i'm gonna see if i can figure out  what you're talking about eric do you have that promo  the opian anthony podcast is here we've wanted to do it for so long finally get the opportunity 
[03:58:30]  subscribe today the podcast will be available so every wednesday original bits from the show  that was the greatest thing ever classic material wait what's this and whatever else we feel like  find the opian anthony podcast on itunes and at facebook.com slash opian anthony there's so much  of that song in that promo yeah and no material of ona other than random sound drops there isn't there's 
[03:59:00]  no actual ona material in it well i kind of figure people sort of know what ona sound like at this  point you're saying ona people know what they do yeah if you're saying classic ona bids the whole  podcast right promote to people who don't have the subscription or don't know the show so you're  just going to assume oh they'll figure it out well i mean if they're listening to the show now  it's like they know it yeah they know what's up in the the promo is not running anywhere else it's 
[03:59:30]  running only on the channel so they're listening to the channel obviously so they know what opian anthony  sound like i'm amazed you got a promo approved without a clip in a setup in it yeah well i mean  hey rob there was no revisions on this one rob can i tell you something huh rob cross who's the  boss of the channel and he's a ball buster when it comes to production yeah and he makes troy go back  and redo shit and he fine tunes and he's every detail i mean rob has a good ear too so he's he's 
[04:00:00]  somebody's uh creative input that i definitely better eric when you're doing worst of the week  countdown he is on your nuts because he's dickish with it yes you find him to be dickish with this  promo i do yes now i'm asking you do you think rob produces uh okay's content easier if there's  eric bashing in it yeah this totally goes against anything that he's ever yelled at any of us for  putting the production you're saying that that if it were any clip besides an e-rock song parody  our boss would have said no this promo does not work that is correct but since it was an e-rock 
[04:00:30]  song parody by the great sean f our boss said a okay troy let's run with it he listened to it once  through he never does that yeah and he just goes i push it through it's fine it's great wow what do  you think of that eric it's a dickish move it is right yes he's taking the do you think troy that  this is a direct shot from rob and eric it is you find it to be it has to be because he can't he 
[04:01:00]  doesn't like any promos or production that he didn't have a say on or had some kind of alteration  to it and for him to go one and done with this obviously he generally does like to stick his  finger in the pie before anybody gets a slice on friday though eric is sassy with him on friday  i think you'll add it rob doesn't like taking rob's shit rob does have a good ear so when he  hears something that sounds good he says go with it you know what i mean like and if he hears  something's how often do you pass a promo through have it listened to by rob cross one time and then 
[04:01:30]  have it hit the air it happens occasionally how occasionally it doesn't are you talking the way  christmas happens occasionally once a year no i'd probably say like every every like how many promos go  through every every three promos does does that happen i'd say like uh i'd say like six to eight  every six to eight promos you'll be like that's good that's fine every six to eight and would you  say how often would you say do you do uh eric bashing promos once every i don't know when was 
[04:02:00]  i don't think i've done anything like that it's not every six to eight promos no all right you you  swear yeah all right i'll take your word for it then let me go to uh two six nine we'll go  straight to you on after hoping anthony live okay thank you i just got one for uh we rock there  i can't come to work today there's a twig in my driveway okay i don't even know what that means i  don't even know what that means i sure i i made the mistake of going to the phones and i'll take  the heat on that one eric uh you really don't can't appreciate the songs as just being funny still 
[04:02:30]  i understand what they're for but the guy's obsession is the problem  yeah i mean ona are i've really grown fond of these songs now uh instead of doing anything  else yes let's just go with eric songs you feel like maybe instead of trying to figure out some  content they're just like oh we could play some eric songs again well how many times does oh force  that into conversation i mean in you know in everybody's defense they are good songs and  tomorrow's a friday show and you know what that means yeah i mean you talk about pushing uh e-rock songs 
[04:03:00]  in instead of content you worried about tomorrow eric we have a lot of guests though who's a guest  tomorrow colin quinn whoa guy fieri and we may have a third possible i believe it is fieri but who is  the name right you said fieri who is no t in it fieri there's no d in it who is the mystery guest  i can't say but it looks like he may come in uh actor movie musician is it blake shelton 
[04:03:30]  his his other friend blake shelton's other is it trace atkins we may have trace atkins tomorrow  yeah if this happens there will be an angelic glow throughout this studio  just don't let him know i was making fun of the military and maybe i wasn't you fucking idiots  did you hear that guy yeah he pissed me off that's because you're making fun of jason ellis  who was making fun of jason you were i wasn't making fun of jason ellis  you goddamn idiot now people are going to be tweeting about this i said i played the jason 
[04:04:00]  ellis clip and i said you were shitting on jason ellis no i wasn't shitting on anyone  i said that i enjoyed the jason ellis clip because he showed respect for me he said he doesn't like  me but i think the reason he doesn't like me is because he respects the hustle and he probably  doesn't like you because you call yourself the future of radio i am the future of radio and i've  never called myself the future of radio until i gets back to him i've never called i'm not  afraid if that gets back to him you said he was a better uh you're a better skateboarder than he is 
[04:04:30]  i am a better skateboard i'm not a better i don't skateboard okay i do radio ah this is gonna start a  war you think so oh it's you're a real son of a bitch troy well i mean don't talk shit on ellis  i'm not talking shit on ellis no no not now you were when like before before that non-specific  can you get me the clip i can't find the clip but i'll tell you what he said the dilette machine's  down dilette machine's down right now you asshole look i think i feel the same way about jason ellis  that he feels about me and the military at the end of the day we have a weird dislike for each other 
[04:05:00]  but i think it's because we're both competitive people and both of us know that we're better  than most other people at sirius xm now we could argue all day over whether jason ellis or me is  better i think we would have differing opinions on that are you a fan of jason ellis's show  i don't listen you know what show i listen to me on fucking repeat i listen to after ona live  then i listen to the sam roberts show online podcast then i listen to my show on sunday but  you've heard his show ron and fez are coming up next right you could try to start as much shit as 
[04:05:30]  you want to but you go hang out with those assholes talking shit about ellis i wasn't talking shit about  anyone he said he wasn't good i said you weren't good and you're not good either troy neither you two  are good why don't you go off and be not good together like a couple of you can have a call  the guys who called him i'm not taking any calls i'm letting ron and fez it's gonna get ugly when  fans start tweeting but you you you and your ideas i'm letting ron and fez take the airwaves  why don't you give us a red dragons take us out ron and fez are coming up next goodbye everybody  opie anthony show is now over for real this time check out the ona show on facebook at facebook.com
