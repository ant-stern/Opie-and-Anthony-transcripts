<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Greg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and setting the tone with their characteristically unrestrained style.  The conversation quickly veered to Norton's experiences learning languages, specifically a memorable French teacher, followed by a rant about bad drivers, targeting a particular ethnicity without explicitly naming the group.  The main topic then shifted to a scathing review of "The Hangover Part II," with Norton highlighting plot holes and questionable character choices in the Thailand setting.  A brief sponsor segment for Wood Floor interrupted, mentioning a lawsuit against Warner Brothers concerning Mike Tyson's face tattoo in the film.  The movie review continued, focusing on the use of exotic locations to mask weak plots.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to Norton's preparation for meeting Malcolm McDowell and Brian Johnson, showcasing his expensive purchases of *A Clockwork Orange* memorabilia (a Japanese poster, a thin British poster, and a program, totaling $1100) for autographs.  This segment included graphic descriptions of Norton's recent masturbation experience and its impact on his sleep.  The hosts then engaged in a debate about politically correct PSAs, specifically one against using the "R-word," leading to a discussion on double standards regarding offensive language, including examples of acceptable usage in certain contexts.  A commercial for a hotel showing people standing on luggage was mentioned, along with the ongoing debate on the use of "gay" as a synonym for stupid.  A video splicing together Michael Richards's racial rant and a naked man on the subway was also discussed.  E-Rock's reluctance to participate in a Pocono Raceway fitness challenge was addressed, leading to a discussion of his past stunts, including the near-fatal cinnamon and mayonnaise challenge, armpit waxing, and various ridiculous costumes.  Audio clips of these past events, featuring E-Rock's pained reactions, were played.  The segment also touched on the high mortality rate among wrestlers from WrestleMania VII.  A listener from England called in, followed by a discussion of President Obama's visit with the Queen of England, including a video clip of a band playing over Obama's toast.  This segment ended with the arrival of Brian Johnson as a guest.

The interview with Brian Johnson covered AC/DC's enduring popularity, the challenges of fame, and the band's continued success in attracting younger fans through new albums.  Johnson discussed his new book, detailing humorous anecdotes from his life and passion for cars, including his early car repair experiences, a humorous account of his first masturbation experience, and Phil Rudd's aggressive driving. He also discussed his passion for vintage car racing, specific cars he owned (including a Shelby GT500 Super Snake and a Lola T-70 Mark I), and a car accident he was involved in. The hosts jokingly asked about the best car he’d received oral sex in.  He discussed his vocal techniques and his dynamic with other band members.  Malcolm McDowell unexpectedly arrived, leading to a surprised and enthusiastic exchange between the two, revealing a pre-existing friendship and reminscing about previous collaborations, McDowell’s upcoming *Clockwork Orange* anniversary events, and future musical projects. Numerous photos were taken.

The interview with Malcolm McDowell focused on his experiences filming *A Clockwork Orange*, including anecdotes about Patrick McGee’s complaints, his consumption of Guinness, his relationship with Stanley Kubrick, improvised scenes (like the "Singing in the Rain" scene), Kubrick's reaction to unscripted additions, a negative encounter with Gene Kelly, the film's critical reception, his relationship with Lindsay Anderson, and the influence of *If*.  He also mentioned physical injuries sustained during filming. Brian Johnson’s unexpected arrival and impromptu reunion with McDowell dominated the latter half, leading to a flurry of activity from the staff to capture the moment.

The after-show segment highlighted Norton's frantic attempts to get autographs from McDowell and Johnson, including concerns about damaging the posters.  Eric's placement of personal items on the autograph table was a point of contention.  Norton's tendency to panic and involve others in his anxieties was discussed, including anecdotes about Steve Leeds's pursuit of Jennifer Lopez for a picture for Norton.  The discussion also included Troy Kwan's upcoming DJ appearance, Opie's perceived guilt over a previous incident involving a hockey poster, promotion of the Joe Rogan Experience, misunderstandings about commercial breaks, and a scheduling conflict regarding "Special Delivery."  Norton apologized for his behavior, ending with anticipation for the results of his autograph quest the next day.  The presence of Eric, Troy, and possibly others in the studio was implied.  Roland (a publicist) was also mentioned as being present during the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m., an out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just, like, hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning. Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hola.  To our Spanish friends.  Yes.  Really?  Say that.  Hola.  Como esta?  Hi, everybody.  I got one of those, uh, cleaning ladies.  Yeah.  I think she's teaching my kids some Spanish.  Uh-oh.  What the hell is that about? 
[00:01:30]  Is that good or bad?  Uh...  I think they're in cahoots, uh, together there.  It's good, though.  My one-year-old and my freaking cleaning lady.  It's good if, uh, he just casually learns it.  It's bad if he ever really needs it.  Yeah.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do we need two languages?  Uh, no.  I took three languages, and I...  English.  I barely do English well.  English.  Spanish, I took six years.  I can't fucking speak a lick of it.  Ooh.  And I did two years of French, because the French teacher was really hot and smelled nice. 
[00:02:00]  How'd that work out?  You know any French?  And then I did a couple weeks of German, and the teacher was so horrendously ugly, I  just dropped that class.  You speak Greek?  Yeah.  Who's the French teacher?  Did you ever see him again?  Fucking asshole.  How can you not when your French is a teacher's hot guy?  Who is he?  That's a man, yes.  She was the stereotypical French teacher, though.  We've talked about this.  Uh-huh.  Uh, bleached blonde hair.  Mm.  Some kind of French perfume.  Perfume-y.  And she had big bosoms, and she wore, like, shirts where maybe she'd have buttoned one more 
[00:02:30]  button, but chose not to.  Oh.  It was stereotypical.  Uh-huh.  So I was getting, like, Ds, D-pluses, maybe.  I was barely passing.  Just gazing into her cleavage.  It was just, and I was young with those fucking boners that come out of nowhere.  The young.  It was perfect.  The young, spontaneous boner.  And it was in the middle of the school day, so it broke up the day.  Yeah.  It was just a perfect scenario.  That sounds nice.  It was really nice. 
[00:03:00]  Uh, just, I want to say, um, uh, again, I have to reiterate.  Yes.  Uh, there is a certain, um, race of people that, uh, cannot drive.  Um.  Asians.  It's, no, no, I'm not, I'm not saying anything.  I'm not, I'm not saying what it is.  Everyone knows.  Well, that's why I said mine.  Really?  Because when you say that, everyone has what they think it is in their heads.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was that right?  Uh, I'm not saying anything.  All I'm saying is, I've, I've noticed in my driving. 
[00:03:30]  Give me a wink.  Was that right?  That, uh, that there is a certain race of people that really, you might, if you, if you  are stereotypically known to be somebody who really can't drive, just look right now.  Look in your mirror.  See all those cars?  Do you see them all?  They want to get past you.  Get out of the way.  Move!  It's astounding every day, especially driving through Queens, uh, which, uh, is known to 
[00:04:00]  have a certain, uh, uh, a very big population of people that are commonly known to not know  how to drive.  Why won't you say who it is?  I'm confused.  Um, because some people get upset if you mention a, a stereotype of certain people.  So I just say it knowing that people will know what stereotype it is and who it is, but  I'd never say it.  So no one could ever say anything about what I'm saying because, uh, uh, I'm not, I never  actually say it.  Did this happen in the city? 
[00:04:30]  Outside of MSG?  It, no.  Okay.  Oh my god.  Wow.  So maybe it happened on 7th day.  No, no, it wasn't.  Outside of MSG or the garden there.  No, no.  Um, it was on the, uh, on the parkway.  And, uh, three cars today.  Three cars in the left lane.  No one in front of them.  A fucking parade behind them. 
[00:05:00]  And as I go past in the middle lane, because there's no way they're ever moving over, I  give a look.  And not just me.  I know I drive, you know, a little maniacal sometimes.  But not just me.  Everybody.  It was a parade of people sweeping around this vehicle.  And it happened with three different vehicles today.  I looked over and there was that dumb fuck face.  That dumb fucking face.  Just looking straight ahead.  No clue.  No peripheral.  That you are fucking up.  No peripheral vision. 
[00:05:30]  That you are fucking up everyone's commute.  There ought to be a test just for certain people to make sure they really know what  they're doing.  Because they just don't seem to know what the fuck they're doing out there on the road.  That's, uh, that's all I have to, um, say.  How slow were they going?  Fucking, like, anywhere between 45 and 50 miles an hour in the left fuck lane.  And it's the parkway?  It's the parkway.  For the people out there, the parkway's a nightmare. 
[00:06:00]  It's only two lanes.  Yeah.  And very curvy, too.  Lots of curves.  So you can't make a lot of moves.  No, no.  You've got to stay in your lane for the most part.  You're pretty restricted as to what you do.  And then the cars come in out of nowhere.  The parkway was made, I think, when we had horse and buggies.  Yeah.  Because there's no room for cars to get on.  Well, the on-ramps are very short.  So that's another thing.  You've got to goose it.  The second you get on the, not even the ramp, the on-ramp, the acceleration lane, when you  get on the curvy part that leads up to that, you've got to goose the fucking vehicle. 
[00:06:30]  So by the time you hit the on-ramp, you're already doing at least 45.  Which is not easy to do.  And then you can punch it, look over, merge in.  Right.  Which isn't easy to do if you're a good driver, an experienced driver.  There's just really not enough room to get up to speed in general.  So then if you've got somebody going slow in one of the lanes, it's a nightmare for  everybody.  They sit, some people sit at the end of the on-ramp with their dumb fucking head turned  over their shoulder.  Right.  Now they have to go from zero to fucking 60. 
[00:07:00]  In a hundred feet.  In a hundred feet in between cars that are fucking wailing past them.  It's astounding.  The stupidity, inexperience, inconsideration, and just general not wanting to fucking get  anywhere that people go through on the roads every day.  And that road, that road, much scarier than Pocono Raceway.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You would rather drive around Pocono Raceway at 130 miles an hour than drive on the parkway. 
[00:07:30]  I'd much rather do that.  I avoid the parkway now because people aren't experienced enough to handle that road with  the speeds of what the cars are doing these days.  But the only reason I take the parkway is because the expressway is a sandblasting mess  of your vehicle because every tractor trailer that's hauling their dirt, these motherfucking  cunts that are out there with their trucks, hey, you know who you are.  They don't brush off their trucks.  There's giant rocks falling out of it and bouncing on the road and smashing into your windshield. 
[00:08:00]  And then, because there's no trucks allowed on the parkway, so that's why I take the parkway.  And then you'll get the idiots that are being plastered with this shit that won't pass the  truck.  So now you're sitting behind an idiot that won't pass the truck and the truck just getting  fucking sandblasted.  Right.  Move!  Those guys are working Joes.  Yeah, well, fuck them.  They're working Joes.  Because there's shit bouncing off the back.  You ever see a nice fucking little golf ball sized rock come off of that at 60 bouncing 
[00:08:30]  and it's coming toward your windshield?  It's just bouncing willy-nilly.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't know where it's going to hang.  Yeah, it's taking a bad hop every time it fucking bounces.  Just a horrible hop right into your windshield.  Great.  Even a little fucking little fleck hits your windshield and it cracks it.  So I take the parkway.  There's less construction on it.  Parkway just really is a scary road.  It's scary.  Very windy.  Especially when, you know, there's volume.  And then there's the people in the middle lane, in the median, there's a gas station 
[00:09:00]  in the median.  Yep.  And they have to do a left lane enter on a short on-ramp.  Yep.  And they, too, they get on this thing thinking, at the last minute, I think they think, oh,  it's a highway.  Yep.  And then they try to merge in at 30 miles an hour at the end of the on-ramp.  Meanwhile, again, I take off from the pumps like a top-fueled dragster.  You have to.  Seeing the fucking green light.  You have to.  You gotta take off right from the pump. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, that's the pitch.  And then you hit the fucking ramp.  You're already doing 60 by the time you merge in.  I'm amazed they still have that gas station.  It's amazing.  I really am.  I'm amazed someone hasn't done the left exit and just smashed into the gas pump.  Just wiped everyone out.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you really have no room.  You're going 65.  You realize, I need gas.  You take the left turn into the gas station.  You don't realize how fast you're coming up to the gas pump.  You've got to slow the fuck down immediately.  Yeah, someone's going to just wipe those out.  I'm amazed it hasn't happened.  Giant fucking mushroom cloud in the middle of the parkway. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, we don't even really need a gas station there.  I guess it's kind of convenient, but I don't know.  It's really not needed.  Yeah, yeah.  I've used it a couple of times.  There's been like, uh-oh.  I think I'm a little low.  It is convenient, but it's not really necessary.  I just wanted to say, you dumb fucks that you know who you are that can't drive.  Just look in your mirror.  Go ahead if you can.  If you can, look in your mirror.  Uh-oh. 
[00:10:30]  What does that mean?  They can't look properly.  What does that mean?  What is going on there?  I'm just saying.  Hey, I saw Hangover 2 last night.  How was that?  With a bunch of us.  A bunch?  How many in a bunch?  Well, first of all, I got to take my wife.  It was the first movie we've seen in a year.  No, I've seen movies.  Actually, I've seen movies and she's seen movies, but us going together is the first time in a year.  Did you feel safe?  Was it boisterous?  What do you mean?  Was the crowd boisterous? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, they were really excited.  Were they unruly youths?  Oh, no, no, no, no, not at all.  No, a lot of people, you know, very focused because they're writing their reviews.  Oh, it was one of the screenings.  Oh, yeah, that's what it was.  Nothing special, really.  We just get to see it before, you know, it opens.  And it was me, my wife, Roland was there, Greg Charles with somebody else from Caroline's.  Then to my left was Young Sam made it, and then the whole morning mashup.  Wow.  Good question coming in.  Did you cut a hole in the bottom of your popcorn for, you know, whoever? 
[00:11:30]  Young Sam.  For Young Sam?  The morning mashup.  Very good question.  Have mashed potatoes.  Oh, not them.  I try to avoid all the treats.  The treats?  I try to avoid the treats at movie theaters, man.  There's just bad things at the movie theater to eat.  That popcorn with the fucking drizzled with 30-weight motor oil.  Drizzled with asbestos.  It's just horrid.  Might as well be.  How about the nachos with that heated up cheese product? 
[00:12:00]  Is it really cheese?  No.  Not a fucking...  That was manufactured somewhere.  Yeah, horrid.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's not cheese.  You have to bring your own snacks, Gregory.  I always do.  You do too.  Yes, I have Swedish meatballs in each pocket.  I dole them out to children.  It doesn't sound convenient.  It's delicious.  It sounds very messy.  I will, in the middle of the film, reach back and fish out a fingernail fall out of my back  pocket and savor it.  That's the worst movie treat ever. 
[00:12:30]  Savor it.  You can't bring Swedish meatballs.  You certainly can.  I have lima beans in my upper pocket.  Lima beans.  They're delicious.  Those must not be the favorites.  No?  Lima beans.  They're horrible.  Yes, they are.  Lima beans.  Worst vegetable ever.  Lima beans.  Ugh.  And fucking Swedish meatballs in your pockets.  Yeah.  Isn't there a link on the Swedish meatballs?  I don't even know.  I'm too busy just scraping my fingernail out of there and savoring the deliciousness.  It's a C for a reason.  Sounds great. 
[00:13:00]  I put a yam in my pocket.  A yam?  Yes.  I should have put it in the front, Gregory.  Pump it up a little bit.  Yes.  They thought I had shitted all over myself.  Excuse me, French.  One of the gentlemen of color goes, that motherfucker shit all over himself.  I was like, I most certainly did not, sir.  A big load of yam in your back pocket. 
[00:13:30]  Yes, I could look a little.  Disgusting.  I have spandex working out pants.  With a squished yam in the back pocket.  Yes, I do in the back.  And Swedish meatballs.  A drippy mess leaving that theater.  How was the movie?  I want a review.  Did you see Hangover?  Yes, I did.  Did you like Hangover?  Meh.  Meh.  You don't like it like everybody else did?  Well, it was...  What didn't you like about it? 
[00:14:00]  I just...  You didn't want to buy in?  The Danny School of Thought on this.  They're just, oh, they're wild and out of control.  Look out.  Look out.  It's a great movie if you're like 18 and you want to go with your friends and stuff.  Oh, look at the wackiness.  This is crazy.  These guys are crazy.  Well...  I don't know.  It's just...  Whatever you thought of Hangover, divide that in half.  Uh-oh.  Half is crazy.  I would give it...  Half is crazy. 
[00:14:30]  I would give it...  If I was a traditional movie critic, two out of five.  Out of five.  Maybe...  Oh, is it four?  I don't know.  Some people use the four star...  Some people use the five star.  I think you should go with the five star.  It gives you a little more detail.  All right.  Two to two and a half if it's a five star.  Two and a half.  So you're thinking...  Let's go right in the middle there.  A little below average.  Yeah, it's good.  Average.  It's going to do well.  Uh...  Rotten Raiders?  I don't think this monitor is on. 
[00:15:00]  It almost...  Something.  The movie almost seems like a parody of itself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Like they really went, okay, we're supposed to be, like you guys just said, wild and crazy,  so we're going to be really wild and crazy.  Yeah.  You know how some people say it's a blank on crack?  This is Hangover 1 on crack.  On crack.  How do they explain?  Now, I understand the guys, the initial guys that are like Hangover 1.  Hanging out are in Thailand, right?  Yeah.  How do they explain everyone else, the peripheral players that kind of got a little, you know, 
[00:15:30]  peace in one, how do they explain them being in Thailand?  There was another wedding.  Yeah.  No, I understand the main players, but aren't some of those peripheral characters that they  encountered...  Like who?  ...somewhere else?  Like, um...  They didn't bring anyone back.  Like Mike Tyson, right?  Mike Tyson does a cameo.  Yeah.  Why is he in Thailand?  And everyone knows that Mike Tyson does a cameo on Hangover 2.  I'm not giving anything away, but I will... 
[00:16:00]  I have to say this today, and I'm giving you enough time to get to your radio.  I have to say this much about his cameo.  It got a zero.  Really?  And I felt...  You know me.  I don't get uncomfortable often.  I was uncomfortable when Tyson's cameo came on screen.  I was uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Because I think the producers and everyone behind Hangover 2 was like, oh, this is the  moment Tyson finally makes an appearance, and the theater is going to go nuts.  There was...  You could almost hear crickets. 
[00:16:30]  And then it was just really uncomfortable.  And that's all I'll say for now.  Even though the fucking paper...  Don't even pick up the New York Post today and read their review.  They give away everything.  They give away every little detail and surprise.  Little nuance.  Because I guess the movie reviewer is very lazy and doesn't have writing skills, so he  decided just to give you a scene-by-scene breakdown of the movie.  That's just bad writing when they do that.  Oh, now what I meant was, like, the Asian guy, right?  Ken Jeong, who's a very funny guy. 
[00:17:00]  We've had him on the show.  Is he in it?  Yes.  Okay, now here's my point.  You got your initial friends that go to this wedding in Thailand or whatever.  the fuck they're doing.  Now, the Asian guy wasn't with them in the first movie.  He wasn't part of their group.  Correct.  So why the fuck is he now, coincidentally, in Thailand while the other guys are?  Well, they explain that.  How?  After the first movie, he becomes friends with Zach, somehow.  Oh, come on.  Zach's character.  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  I can't believe it. 
[00:17:30]  I can't buy into that.  Anthony's right.  The storyline of Hangover 2.  Yes.  I'm not buying that.  Yeah.  How would they become friends?  They become friends.  And Ed Helms, the dentist, he falls in love with a Taiwanese.  Oh, okay.  Who's beautiful in the movie, by the way.  Yeah.  Really, really beautiful.  So I guess they're going to get married in Thailand.  Uh-huh.  See, are there any other characters from the first movie that end up there like the Asian 
[00:18:00]  guy?  Who else?  I'm trying to think.  I haven't seen it in a while.  But like the Asian guy, you're like, all right, why is he there?  Right.  Is there anyone else from the first movie that had like a part, wasn't part of the group,  but ends up somehow being in Thailand?  No, I think that's it.  That's it?  Yeah.  Mike Tyson and the Asian guy.  Mike Tyson, who is completely separated from the movie and has a cameo.  And there's no reason why he's in Thailand.  They sort of explain that.  Is he a friend?  You want me to give it? 
[00:18:30]  I'm being careful here.  I don't care.  I don't care.  We used to be asshole movie guys, and we're trying to be a little better, because this  is going to be a big movie.  Well, he should have a cameo, because Mel Gibson wasn't allowed to do it, so you might  as well get the guy who went to jail for rape.  Get the rapist.  Oh, I don't think he did it.  Mel Gibson's role in this movie was supposed to be a tattoo artist, because we've all seen  the trailer, so I'm not giving this away.  Ed Helms, his character, has the Mike Tyson tattoo, the exact Mike Tyson tattoo, because  he woke up from a crazy night, and also he wakes up with this ridiculous tattoo. 
[00:19:00]  He's a dentist in L.A.  And what's he going to do now?  And they were shocked about this tattoo for maybe 30 seconds in the movie, and then they  just went about their other shenanigans.  Like, okay, we acknowledge that this guy had his face tattooed.  There's more craziness to acknowledge in the movie, I guess.  I'll tell you this much.  When they finally get back to the resort, not much is made of the face tattoo this guy  has.  That looks just like Mike Tyson. 
[00:19:30]  And that will ruin his business.  Like, who's going to the dentist that has a tattoo like that?  Look, I understand it's a dumb movie, but some of this stuff, it's so ridiculous.  Like, his wife-to-be doesn't even acknowledge that his face is now tattooed after this crazy  night of shenanigans.  No.  He says something like, oh, I'll just get it lasered off when I get to L.A.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  Then problem solved.  Let's move on to another wacky thing that's going on.  Zach is a funny fucking guy.  Yeah, he's a weirdo, but he's funny, man. 
[00:20:00]  Yes.  And he's funny in this movie.  Ken Jeong is funny in this movie.  They gave him a big part.  And if it wasn't for those two, this would be a fucking stinker.  It really would.  Of course, he did well in the first one.  So they pile on some more for him.  Paul Giamatti's in it.  And I actually said, and I got kind of an elbow.  My wife appreciates my fucking, when I'm a dick.  She doesn't mind that at all, but she minds it when I'm really loud about it. 
[00:20:30]  Oh.  And I didn't realize how loud I was being.  And Paul Giamatti shows up, and I actually, I couldn't help myself.  I said, here's Paul Giamatti to save the movie.  Ooh.  And then he's not even used a lot.  No.  You got Paul Giamatti in Hangover, too, paying whatever the fuck he wants.  Reviews here.  Yeah.  A film that seems to have been written mainly with the find and replace function on Microsoft  Word. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, shit.  Okay.  A soulless and badly unfunny retread of everything that worked the first time.  Yes.  I hate when fucking movies do that.  Yes.  Uh, can't justify essentially reenacting, beat for beat, the plot of its predecessor.  Yes.  All that.  All that and more.  Those are the, like, the rotten reviews.  The fresh reviews.  Yeah.  Aren't that much better.  Really?  Let me see a fresh review.  I hate that about Rotten Tomatoes, because it'll be a bad review, but it'll still be a fresh  review.  It's, uh, you know, the movie opens Friday, I guess, so we'll give it a week or two, and 
[00:21:30]  then we'll really discuss this.  Yes, because I have major fucking problems with this movie.  I bet financially it does well.  It's going to do very well.  Mark my words, it's going to do very well.  People are going to march to the theater, and there's enough laughs in there to keep you  going, but I don't know, if you're a fan of Hangover, I think it's a big drop off.  I really do.  Hey, listen to these good, these are, quote, good reviews.  Yeah, I got it.  What happens in Bangkok isn't as much fun as when it happened in Vegas, but it's still 
[00:22:00]  worth the trip.  How is that a good review?  That's positive.  Here's another one.  So closely mirrors its blockbuster predecessor in every vital aspect that it can scarcely  claim to call itself a sequel.  That is a good review.  That shouldn't be a good review.  Can I tell you something?  You know how, God, I want to, you know how they said scene by scene, you know?  Yeah.  You know how the first movie ends where he was the whole time?  Yeah.  I know that. 
[00:22:30]  It's going to be the same exact fucking thing.  Oh, crap.  But they have to go on this adventure to figure out that, you know, he was always...  Wow, that's like the same movie.  It's exact.  That's why I have to say that.  And that's it.  Right.  Whew.  Fuck that.  And I told Ant before the show, I think when a movie franchise or a movie in general  knows they're going to be in trouble with a certain project, they find it.  They film it in an exotic location.  I finally figured this out.  Because in this movie, it's Thailand, it's the beaches of Thailand, and the beautiful 
[00:23:00]  resorts, and the water, and all that.  And then you got Bangkok, which is just crazy.  And they actually go into some of these places where you get prostitutes and stuff.  So you got, you know, they're actually filming with locals, with these women.  Yeah.  That you know are actual prostitutes.  There's no way they brought extras in for that.  Because you can tell by their dead eyes as they're filming that they're not actresses  and extras.  And I think movies will film in exotic locations.  So when the action gets a little slower, you get some really cool shit to look at that 
[00:23:30]  kind of distracts you.  And I think that's a trick that Hollywood does.  That's a trick.  That it finally figured out.  Yeah, they did that with Sex and the City.  Right.  Because they threw them in the Middle East.  Right.  Because they knew the movie would suck if they were just in New York again.  But all of a sudden you see, like, camels and a really nice desert.  You forget that the movie sucks.  Okay, I get it.  You see the pyramids in the background.  And you're like, oh, wow, the pyramids.  And you forget that, you know.  Yeah, it's the same fucking hags trying to get fucked.  It's also, though, how the actors and the director can go to a cool place. 
[00:24:00]  Like, they'll say, like, we're going to do it in Thailand.  It also gets the actors to sign on for the sequel.  Like, oh, okay.  And the director.  And they're like, let's do it in Thailand.  Because they all want to go to Thailand.  The biggest laugh was showing the pictures at the end.  Because it's just like the first movie.  All of a sudden they find a camera.  Actually, this time it's a camera phone.  And they explain, like, hey, where have you been for two days?  You know, we tried calling.  Well, my phone was dead.  But I finally recharged it.  And guess what I found?  Oh, God.  The same movie. 
[00:24:30]  So then they sat around like, okay, we're only going to look at the pictures once.  And then we're going to agree.  We're going to delete all the pictures.  And then it was the montage of the pictures like the first movie.  And, yeah, the biggest laughs of the movie were, you know, as the credits were rolling.  And there were some pretty funny fucking pictures in there.  I've got to be honest with you.  But, I mean, come on.  Same movie.  I want to say more.  But I don't want to spoil it for the people that, you know, want to go and see it.  It's really disappointing, really.  Because, like, can you imagine if they did, like, Superbad 2?  Where they do all the same things.  Like, how cringy would you be watching them? 
[00:25:00]  Hey, let's go to the liquor store.  We've got to get some booze.  And now we're running around.  It was almost like.  McLovin.  Hey.  You're like, what?  It was almost like they wanted, but they couldn't commit, that they were almost making fun of themselves  in the first movie with this movie.  Which probably would have been better.  Right.  That would have been a nice little take on this.  You know?  Yeah.  Like, really throw it off.  But they couldn't commit.  But it was, it was like Hangover on crack.  Oof. 
[00:25:30]  And you know the, um, actually I'm going to put Wood Floor liquor on for this one because  I just read this in the paper as well.  Go ahead, Wood Floor.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  How's it going to be, Mr. Hughes?  Did you, thank you.  Did you see Hangover 2?  No, I didn't go see it yet.  But I saw this in the news as well.  Apparently the guy that gave Mike Tyson his tattoo claims that the artwork on his face  is original artwork and that he owns the copyright to it.  So he's trying to file an injunction to stop the release of the movie.  And he's also looking for $30 million. 
[00:26:00]  Just fucking screwbags.  The artist that did the tattoo, the famous Tyson tattoo, is looking for $30 million.  Everything's a money grab in this country.  $30 million.  By the way, because it's the exact, Ed Helms has the exact fucking tattoo.  But it's a very famous kind of, it's almost an iconic tattoo now, Tyson's tattoo.  It's like if you copied the Mona Lisa as a goof.  But this is why, like, we always talk about how politicians and the government and the banks  and the rights scumbag, this is the public.  That's why fucking lawyers are the way they are. 
[00:26:30]  That's why fucking insurance companies are the way they are.  Because some scumbag wants a $30 million payout because they goofed on the tattoo.  Right.  Do you feel like people do it, though, just because they see everyone else doing it  and then they feel like, hey, if I don't do it, I'm a fucking sucker.  Sure, part of it, absolutely.  But there's that, which means they have no integrity.  It's like watching a gang rape and going, well, fuck it, everybody else took their dick  in their mind as well.  Gang.  Well, the guy's taking his artwork.  $30 million, that guy works.  His artwork, seriously, yeah.  But that's just, that's a money grab.  $30 fucking million.  What a jerk off. 
[00:27:00]  It's nothing.  He's saying it's an original tattoo.  Yeah, fuck him.  So.  Jimmy, think about how many times you've actually seen the Mona Lisa in different movies,  though.  I mean, imagine how much royalty money they'd actually have to pay out for that.  But why would you have to pay royalty money for using an image in a joke form?  It's a goof.  Let me read this so we got all our facts.  Oh, you had the story?  A federal judge has found a temporary cure for The Hangover Part 2, the sequel to the  two times I'm open this weekend, blah, blah, blah, may have to cough up $30 million for  copyright infringement after recreating Mike Tyson's Mayori, is that how you say that? 
[00:27:30]  Mayori Warrior face tattoo on actor Ed Helms in the film.  S. Victor Whitmill, creator of the original tattoo for Tyson, who appears in both Hangover  films, sued Warner Brothers.  A St. Louis judge denied his bid to stop the film's release, but she also said the case will  proceed and she will consider Whitmill's request for a later injunction, which would stop the  film's distribution.  Wait, he's in the movie?  Uh, Tyson.  Oh.  I know that red weird, but it's Tyson who appeared in both movies.  What a fucking...  With the tattoo. 
[00:28:00]  Money grab.  And Ed Helms, his whole role in this movie is to make really over-the-top crazy, wacky  faces.  Oh, really?  Is that what he's doing?  Which got uncomfortable after a while, too.  Right.  Over-the-top, reacting really crazy, because he's in some crazy situations.  I absolutely won't see this until fucking months from now.  Way down the road?  And so Keith puts it on and tells you how awesome it is, and you gotta watch it?  Dude, you gotta put it on, and then he'll put it on a fucking casino hotel room. 
[00:28:30]  There's a scene that Jimmy's gonna love.  Span is on a computer monitor somewhere.  By the way, you know...  You're gonna love one of the scenes, Jimmy.  Really?  Yeah, it's...  It's a ladyboy, it must be.  It's Thailand.  Oh, ladyboy.  That's what they call him, yeah.  I'm not a big ladyboy fan, but...  Ladyboy.  That's what they call trainers in Thailand.  There might be a ladyboy scene that you might absolutely enjoy.  By the way, I think legally, once that art went on Tyson's face for real, I think that  guy ceased to have the ability to say...  Is that a ladyboy? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's a big clit.  Beef jerky dick.  Fucking, uh...  I'm gonna bet that once it becomes a part of Tyson's face, that guy loses the ability  to say, hey, that's my art, you can't copy it.  Because that's like saying, now, what if a guy plays Tyson in a movie?  Is the makeup artist who does Tyson's makeup in the movie using copyright infringement if  this guy does?  Get the fuck out of here.  Do they have to put a different tattoo that's similar but not exactly the same on his face?  Yeah, this tattoo's exact. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Isn't it great?  Don't you think it would be good for his business that this tattoo's in two massively successful  films?  I bet he wanted to put it on and wouldn't let him.  I bet you he wanted to be the one who did the makeup on it or something and didn't get  the gig.  He's probably some shit like that.  Oh, really?  I'm guessing.  Woodflore, anything else?  You would think that if anybody could lay claim to it, it would be Tyson because it's  become so iconic and related to Tyson.  Well, it's his face.  It's also, it's on his body.  So any type of an impression of Tyson, you want to do that as visual would require that. 
[00:30:00]  I mean, yeah.  Tyson's cameo.  Oh, boy.  God, I wanted to say it.  Oh, boy.  All right, boys.  Have a good day.  Good night.  It got nothing.  And usually when you go to one of these preview screenings, people are really overexcited because  you're being one of the first people to see the movie.  So you almost have that energy like everything is good around you.  Yeah.  And it got nothing, man.  I mean, nothing.  It's embarrassing.  Ken Jeong's dick got a lot, though.  Oh, God, again? 
[00:30:30]  I tweeted yesterday, his penis looks like a gorilla's nipple.  It looks like a gorilla's nipple.  How could you possibly have nothing going on?  A little mushroom in the middle of a giant pubic mound?  I can't believe how fucking tiny this thing is.  That's crazy.  He's the man for fucking having no shame.  Just completely nude in one scene with frontal nudity. 
[00:31:00]  And having nothing like that.  That's pretty embarrassing.  Having nothing and having the balls to be like, fuck, I don't give a fuck.  This is funny and I'm going with it.  But they did it already.  I know.  Where's the shock?  Sam and Roland were there and I got a little audio.  We did a little, I don't want to call it a bit, but it's sort of a bit.  Before the movie started, we're all hanging out and Roland is pitching guests for this show.  That's all he does.  That's all he does.  Anytime we see him on the air. 
[00:31:30]  There have been times we've been talking on the air.  He's nudged up to me and shown me a piece of paper and pointed at a name.  It's like, I'm kind of busy here right now.  Do they pay Roland to buy the guest?  I know, right?  He really is pushy.  He would say, yeah, he gets a lot of pressure.  And I told Roland, you should give the list of people that we said no to that would have definitely been booked on the show.  Because that would be good enough.  I mean, everyone that listens to this show on a regular basis knows that the guest bookings have gone through the roof. 
[00:32:00]  Through the roof.  So that's all that should matter to the boys way down the hall.  But for some reason, it's got to be actual numbers they care about.  So that puts pressure on us to maybe say yes to people we don't want to say yes to.  Yeah.  To take care of our pal Roland, who's doing a great job for us.  Big ones today.  Yeah, Malcolm McDowell and Brian Johnson of ACDC.  So, before the movie started, Roland is pitching Tom Papa. 
[00:32:30]  And of course we would take Tom Papa.  We've taken him many times.  Of course we would.  But he's obsessing and just kept going at it with me.  Like, Tom Papa, Tom Papa, Tom.  And I'm like, I'm ready to watch Hangover 2.  Tom Papa.  So finally, we're sitting there.  And what's important to this audio clip, there was a very bald gentleman in the front row.  Gentleman.  Extremely bald.  One of the worst balding spots I've ever seen in my life.  Follicles.  It almost looked like a cotton candy machine. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, no.  Because he had long hair that was just whispering all around the fucking place.  Oh, boy.  Like tornado hair almost.  It was horrible.  And he's reading a newspaper in the front row waiting for the movie to start.  He picked the front row, by the way.  There were plenty of seats still available.  I don't know why you would sit in that front row seat.  Roland, what did you think of Hangover 2?  He just walked in.  I enjoyed it.  It was a fun summer movie.  Fun summer movie. 
[00:33:30]  You know you were sleeping through part of the movie.  And once again, I was too scared to pull out a fucking video camera.  Because those green dots were all over the place.  I had no worries.  Because there's three guys next to me that had those little infrareds.  They would kick you right out.  Dude, there were infrareds everywhere.  They're green dots.  They appear on the screen.  I told you the last movie.  They wait for a nice bright scene on the movie screens.  And then they could use those fucking things.  But as soon as it goes dark, you see all the green dots.  They are looking for you, man.  So I'm like, I can't fucking pull out my camera. 
[00:34:00]  And you were snoring.  Pissing off people around you.  You were just like four seats away from me.  I was closing my eyes, resting a little bit.  Why did you like Hangover 2?  It's funny.  What did you get into?  What?  It was funny.  They're adventures.  Funny.  They're adventures.  Name one adventure.  Yeah, what kind of adventure?  Please.  Well, I got lost a little bit because my eyes closed.  And I was trying to figure out what happened. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, you got a little sleepy-eyed?  And then you wake up.  It's like a time machine to you.  Like, what the fuck?  I remember that scene.  And I went, oh, my eyes closed.  Oh, all right.  Well, you know the movie was just okay, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I know you're in that publicist world, and you've got to play it differently, but that  movie wasn't as good as the first one.  You've got to kiss ass.  But it will do well.  Yeah.  All right.  So he's pushing Tom Papa.  Tom Papa.  You've got the bald guy in the front row.  So I said, Sam, just turn on your iPhone.  We've got to do something here. 
[00:35:00]  What's wrong about you?  What were you saying from across the thing?  Tom Papa for this week.  You're pitching a guest as we sit here waiting for Hangover 2 to start?  We have time, so yes.  Well, let's have a little fun with this.  Fun?  Yeah.  I don't like fun.  Why don't you address the movie theater right now and ask the people what they think of  Tom Papa as we wait for Hangover 2 to start?  And if I hear a relatively positive response, we'll take them.  It is a great way to get the public perception.  It is. 
[00:35:30]  I do agree, but there's a lot of publicists I know here.  See, this is the real Roland, by the way.  You start, you know, fucking around with his livelihood and publicists around.  You hear the real Roland coming out.  In case you're wondering who the real Roland is.  He's not as brave now.  I'm wondering what he is.  I know here.  So you're saying it would destroy your professional credibility?  No, it's just like they go, I told you he was an ass.  It's just like solidifies.  But Roland, you are an ass. 
[00:36:00]  I know, but not in public.  Wow, he's really nervous.  What?  You're really nervous.  Because I know these people.  It's not like we're like in 34th Street, like saying, what's up?  I will do something else.  I know this is a visual, but I tweeted this picture.  There's a guy about three or four rows in front of us that's really bald.  And he's reading a newspaper right now.  If you yell out, hey, Baldy, what are you reading?  I'll take Tom Papa on our radio show.  Hey, Baldy, what are you reading up there?  Thanks, pal.  There you go. 
[00:36:30]  Tom Papa.  Oh, my God.  Did he turn around?  Yeah, he turned around.  I'm all the way in my seat.  I've ducked way the hell down.  So, Opie, your wife is in the fetal position.  She's mortified.  He looks upset, the man.  So, is Tom okay for Thursday or Friday?  I think I just lost a bet.  My back hurts because I don't want to sit back up.  Is he looking still?  Bald.  No, all right.  You proved your point, you sick fuck.  And then he knows we're all uncomfortable, so he does it again. 
[00:37:00]  He did it.  Did the guy turn around?  Oh, yeah, he did.  Yeah, was he mad?  I didn't see because I fucking scrunched all the way the fuck down.  Right before the movie started, I yelled, Baldi!  He was one of those movie reviewers.  He's always around.  Oh, you know who he is?  Oh, he's always there.  Yeah, he's one of those.  Is that why he had to fucking read a newspaper?  Yeah, because he always writes reviews.  Every time you go to screenings, he's always there.  He's always there?  Yeah.  So, why would you fuck with him?  I don't give a shit about him.  He's not...  He's not...  Very uncomfortable.  He's just a reviewer.  I was very uncomfortable.  I don't know if the clip completely does it justice, but I was very uncomfortable. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  We would have taken Tom Popper.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  I saw Tom last night.  Of course we would.  He told me, he's like, I think I'm trying to come in this week.  I'm like, what day?  Thursday or Friday?  Yeah.  So, I kind of yesed him in his face anyway.  Yeah.  I gave him an okay in person.  That would have been awful if that didn't work.  Then I would have to backtrack.  Tommy mistake.  All right, Roland.  Two stars.  Two to two and a half stars out of five for Hangover 2 there, Roland. 
[00:38:00]  Can we please have a better headphones?  So, Malcolm McDowell's got a broken headphone on his head.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Why?  All the time.  The guests come in and it's like, oh, God.  We need a better headphone right there for today.  You know, Mars will come in like this.  Yeah.  Mars will shake it and step on it.  Oh, really?  Is that what he does?  We need a better one.  I see.  Speaking of Malcolm McDowell and Brian Johnson.  By the way, we just got the book in front of us.  You've had it for a few days, right?  I'm 140 pages in.  The fucking...  It's great.  The pictures of the cars he owns.  Holy shit, man.  You see this shit?  Wow.  Nice.  It's a really good book. 
[00:38:30]  It's fucking hilarious.  And me and Ant noticed that you brought in a lot of stuff today.  Yes, you really did.  And of course, you know, the regulars to this radio show know that you really like collecting  autographs and pictures and having them sign all sorts of stuff.  And as much as I make fun of you, then you tell me that you got Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to  sign a basketball and I want to cry.  So, I'm not that much better.  Huh?  He signed it to me.  Yeah, but that's what I would want it to me.  This poster, I wouldn't get.  I don't even know if I'm going to get these things signed. 
[00:39:00]  But you brought in a lot of stuff to get signed.  A couple.  Not too many.  A couple.  There's one or two things I'm not going to get signed, I think.  Because I bought one item yesterday that I just have never seen before and I'm not  going to get it signed.  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  It's just kind of a rare item, I think.  And I don't want to...  Wouldn't it be good, though, to have it signed?  No, I'll get...  Can you show us what you brought in?  It's like show and tell, Todd.  There is a giant case there.  That looks like an artist's portfolio.  That's what I got... 
[00:39:30]  I'll tell you...  Is that like for artists?  Yeah.  Art students?  I made the mistake...  It has that...  What is...  How do you explain it?  It's for like an architect or something like that.  It's giant.  It's one of those giant flat...  A giant flat briefcase.  Briefcase.  Briefcase.  What's that?  That's a guy to age all.  Yes.  And fur from the fur house he made her.  I went to three different places.  I made the mistake of Twittering yesterday.  I said, where's a place to buy Moomy memorabilia?  Aside from Ted's memorabilia place.  Yes, of course.  Because I really have made my own fucking hell.  Ted's memorabilia emporium. 
[00:40:00]  And they're like, you know, the clockwork orange.  I don't need any type of clock.  I don't want time to eat oranges.  All right.  I read one in the cab that made me laugh out loud for about 40 blocks.  You LOL'd?  I laughed out loud.  It was so stupid.  But a couple of things here.  I obviously have the Blu-ray here, but I don't know.  You're panicking.  I am.  Why are you panicking?  So I'll tell you the things I bought.  Why do you panic?  Because Malcolm's a fucking...  He's a biggie. 
[00:40:30]  He's in the top five biggest ever for me.  Wow.  I've met him before and I already have a photo with him.  But to get him to sign something, he's one of the top five biggest ever.  Very good.  Okay.  So you got the Blu-ray.  The things I didn't bring with me, I have photos of, is I got...  Because I'm not going to get it signed.  You got like four things in that bag alone.  And then you got the briefcase thing over there.  I bought...  And then you got that other thing.  I bought a patch.  Yeah.  A really cool patch.  For your eye?  No, I start smoking again.  It's a clockwork orange patch.  It helps you stop.  I'll show you a photo of it. 
[00:41:00]  But I've never seen it before.  But he can't sign it.  There's no way for him to sign it.  Oh.  Where is it?  Have him do some type of sewing on it.  Maybe he can sew his name onto it.  How's that fucking...  That's cool, right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Clockwork orange type of patch.  Yeah, only $95.  All right.  Wow.  Where's that patch?  It's home.  I didn't bring that in.  Oh, you decided not to bring it?  Yeah, because I'm not going to get him to sign it.  Or the fucking...  None of us are going to be able to get anything else signed?  Because you got 10 things?  No, no, no.  I'm not going to get 10.  No, I'm not.  And also this thing that this piece of a press kit I bought, which just kind of has like 
[00:41:30]  a list of the cast in it and stuff, but they would hand it to the press at the movie.  Sure.  But I'm not bringing that in.  Here we go.  It's not much.  But this item I've never seen before.  This is an actual fucking booklet that they would hand out in the theater for fucking...  That looks very nice.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not going to get this signed, though.  You're not going to get that signed.  I don't know.  There's something so cool about it as is.  You're like a crazy person.  Wait, you don't want Malcolm McDowell to sign that? 
[00:42:00]  Why not?  You should have Malcolm McDowell sign that.  Oh, maybe I will.  I can't open it.  Wait, why wouldn't you want that signed?  Did they seal this?  Yeah, I think it's sealed.  Oh, really?  You're losing your mind.  Oh, there it is.  There we go.  Jimmy, why wouldn't you want that signed?  Because I think...  He was in the movie.  I know, but there's something so cool about it being...  That's the guy.  But that's the guy.  Maybe I'll give him a sign.  I'll never...  At the very least, have him sign the back or something.  The back is cool, right?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's panicking.  This has fucking all kinds of cool...  People are calling you nervous, fancy Jimmy. 
[00:42:30]  They love you.  Jay and Huntington loves nervous, fancy Jimmy.  I'm not going to open it.  I don't want to break it.  Fucking...  Oh, my God.  He's crazy.  I love this.  This is his crazy.  This is Malcolm.  We all have our craziness.  You're seeing Jimmy's now.  Malcolm is one of the fucking...  He's the fucking...  One of the fucking godfathers.  What?  You want to sign true for a person?  That's fine.  That's all I need.  No, he's not.  I know everybody else wants to get stuff signed, too.  I'm not going to be...  Rome was just fucking with you.  Okay.  I got some...  Oh, what do I have in here?  Oh, I bought these. 
[00:43:00]  These are all original movie cards.  Oh, wow.  That's very cool.  These are the first items I brought.  They have the X rating on the bottom.  Yes.  We had an X.  What are those called?  Movie cards?  These are lobby cards.  Lobby cards.  Okay.  And this one here where he's going for the tits I've never seen before.  The other ones are harder, but I got that one.  Are those originals?  Yes.  They're like 85 bucks a piece.  Damn.  I spent a lot of money yesterday.  I went nuts.  Ask him if he remembers doing that.  Oh, he will.  Do you remember this? 
[00:43:30]  How much did you spend yesterday?  $1,100.  $1,100 of Clockwork Orange memorabilia.  Jimmy is a hoarder.  I really am to a certain point.  It's hilarious.  Why don't you just get one thing and go, wow, this would be cool.  Performers signed $1,100.  I'll tell you why, because I'm not going to get all this stuff signed.  I'm really not.  I'm not going to be an asshole about it.  There might be three items I want. 
[00:44:00]  Jimmy, I don't care if you lay it out from here to all the way down the hall.  Nah, I don't want to annoy Malcolm.  I don't want to annoy Malcolm.  You know, he's fucking a guest.  He's fucking a guest.  Yeah, he's fucking a guest.  All right, so that's...  Wait, he's got to put it all back in his special cardboard.  That's to go back.  His special cardboard envelope.  Exactly the way it's supposed to.  Everything mocked?  Everything membed?  He's got to make sure it's back in his plastic bag.  Now, I was debating not getting these posters signed, because I never saw them before.  And there's something cool about it. 
[00:44:30]  I might do a guy that was in the movie.  Get a cool marker.  And if it was a movie where it wasn't so iconic, and he wasn't such a huge part of it,  I wouldn't get Dim to sign it.  If we had Dim in, and that was it.  If I had Malcolm, I'd get fucking Warren Clark, too.  I'd fucking absolutely...  You got the main guy, so he should sign all of that stuff.  Are you kidding?  I'm not going to get lost.  I'm going to get...  What's the rest of the stuff?  You don't want to show us?  No, I'm going to open it now, but I have to be really careful with it, because it was  really hard to fucking pack.  Oh.  One of them was really...  It's really like... 
[00:45:00]  I don't want it to bend.  You might as well just fix that there.  Excuse me, Warren.  Thanks.  This is Jimmy's thing, man.  That thing is...  It's a giant flat suitcase.  Dossier.  Yeah, right.  That he's got...  It is the size...  It's the size of a fucking piece of luggage that you would have to check on a plane.  It's an art portfolio.  Yeah.  There you go.  Except it's very thin.  But it is giant.  Now, I have to figure out how to do this one.  Did you buy the art portfolio thing?  No, I did that to get my Sabbath photo signed in L.A.  That's how I transported it across country. 
[00:45:30]  Okay.  All right.  He's careful.  I even wrote fucking up on it.  Yes.  Hold on.  Hold on.  So when Jonathan had it...  I have my flip cam today, too.  I'm not relying on any shoddy camera work.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Fucking Malcolm McDowell.  Hold on.  I don't know.  These are not big deals.  I know, but this is so weird.  I'm going to film it and see if we got something.  Watch the coffee.  Hold on.  Don't spill that.  Hold on a minute.  I have my questions already.  Do you like acting?  Look at this thing, though. 
[00:46:00]  How do I move these eggs?  His fucking eggs are in the way.  How do I move these eggs?  We're in the middle of Jimmy panicking.  Jimmy is in complete panic mode.  Malcolm McDowell is coming in from Blackboard Orange.  Because we got Brian Johnson first, we have such a tight fit with these guys.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  We have to get the TVs off and fucking Brian Johnson.  Everybody can't.  We have to do Brian Johnson pictures or something a certain way because we can't have fucking  Malcolm walking in like Brock Lesnar did.  It's Malcolm McDowell.  Oh, it's crazy.  The fucking guy was like knighted.  You can't do that shit. 
[00:46:30]  It'll work out.  So now.  Is he a sir?  Is he a sir?  I don't know.  Don't say that because if he's not, you'll feel like an asshole.  Yes.  That's true.  Jimmy is now carefully opening up the.  Opening that.  Do you have a few things in there?  Two.  Two things.  And this is stuff you want Malcolm McDowell to sign?  I would hope that he would.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think which one I want to open a certain way.  I told you to leave that alone.  It's a very important work of art.  All right.  Can someone just hold this like really flat?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Assist Jimmy.  But don't fuck this up.  He's carefully opening it. 
[00:47:00]  Do not fuck this up.  Mars, you punch it.  I'll give you $1,000.  Oh, God.  This right here.  Imagine just slamming your fist into that thing.  He'd lose his mind.  I'm not going to take it out, though.  Look, he doesn't want to take it out.  Why?  Because it was so hard to get in.  Like without being...  It's a fucking...  Bring the camera over here.  I'll show it to you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I got to get off.  What is it?  It's the original movie poster, but it's the Japanese version.  Oh.  Let me see.  Because you can see how fucking delicate it is.  It's the Japanese version of the poster. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, my God.  I got to sneeze.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, nice, dude.  So I got that to be signed.  That was a Lulu.  All right.  And what's the other side?  Oh, let's turn it with this.  The other side.  It's got...  Oh, boy.  Is he feeling very...  This one has a little thin British poster that I've never seen before.  Oh, look at that.  Yes.  I don't know what this is.  You bought it.  What do you mean you don't know what it is?  Well, it says Malcolm McDowell.  It's a movie poster without the guys on it.  It's got different guys on it. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, who is that?  I don't know who they are.  They're different people.  For a fucking Broadway production?  Yeah.  I have no idea what that is.  So I'm going to have him just sign it right there.  But I want these two things signed and maybe one...  Maybe the program.  That's it.  I'm not going to go crazy.  No?  You're not going crazy spending $1,100.  $1,100?  That wasn't very good.  But I had to do it, dude.  The Japanese fucking poster is beautiful.  It's in perfect condition.  I've never seen...  And it's an original.  I had to get it.  The only thing odd...  And you can tell it's Japanese because it says a crockwork horn. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, what a hacky Japanese-y joke.  Yeah, yeah.  I went a little nuts, yes.  I look inside Jimmy's obsession.  This is his thing, man.  But this is a guy I really love and a fucking movie I love.  Sure.  So I don't feel bad.  No.  It'll go in a place of honor in my home.  Yeah.  Where I can see it, right?  There's a place in my apartment you can see from my bedroom and my bathroom.  So when I'm cumming or shitting, which are the two greatest things, I'll be able to  look at this poster.  I'm hoping to get on camera him saying no to signing anything. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, God.  And then the look of disappointment on little Jimmy's face.  Oh, with that big fucking track.  I already got a photo with him that's signed.  Like, I would be hurt.  Like, ah, whatever.  But I mean, you know, whatever.  He's still...  Again, if he fucking spit on me, he's Malcolm McDowell, you can't fucking...  All right, we'll see what happens.  I don't see why he would say no.  But I'm worried about this fucking Brian Johnson crossover thing.  And I'm looking forward to talking to Brian Johnson, too.  But I'm worried about this fucking crossover.  Oh, yes.  Yes, we're going to have to take our pictures outside. 
[00:49:30]  Well, Jimmy's got it all figured out.  Jimmy, where do you want us to get our Brian Johnson pictures?  Fucking got my fork.  And what if Malcolm McDowell shows up in the middle of the Brian Johnson interview because  Brian Johnson's late?  They can talk about English things.  I'm sure they're aware of each other.  Brian Johnson will definitely know who Malcolm is.  Are we allowed to have them both in at the same time?  Oh, yeah, that'd be great.  I don't know if they would want to.  But with...  Oh, I have a knife. 
[00:50:00]  I want to get...  Ah, he does.  I have a knife.  That's kind of like a threat.  I went to take a fork out.  I took a knife out.  Jimmy's losing his mind here.  I love this.  I knew this.  I'm very tired.  Should we just do a best of bit until Malcolm comes?  Because Jimmy's so distracted.  I love it.  I haven't slept in like two days.  Because the other night, two nights ago, I got maybe two hours.  And then last night, I was so fucking tired.  I was out for hours shopping for this stuff. 
[00:50:30]  And I didn't know what to get.  The first place I went had like the movie cards and that stuff.  So I'm like, I got to get them.  But then I went to the next place that had that like weird thin British poster.  I'm like, I fucking got to get that.  And then I went to the place in Soho that had the Japanese one, which was beautiful.  And then they had the fucking patch.  And then they had that fucking...  I'm tired, dude.  And then they had the fucking movie program.  The movie poker?  The movie program.  And that was a surprise.  I didn't know that was being sold.  So I think I took like 40 minutes to find that. 
[00:51:00]  $1,100 just to...  I find absolutely nothing wrong with that, by the way.  If you love a movie like that as much as you love it...  No, there's everything wrong with this.  Look at Jimmy.  He's losing his fucking mind.  I'm losing my mind because I'm so tired, dude.  I went to bed last night.  I feel like at 12, 12, 30, I get five hours.  And I jerked off.  And fucking, dude, it doesn't knock me out anymore.  It makes me more awake.  That used to be a great sleeping pill.  Remember that?  Dude, I'm not jerking off.  I sleep better.  I really do.  Nah, it's a great sleeping pill.  But not anymore.  I'm wide awake after I fucking blow a load.  What's up with that?  I don't know. 
[00:51:30]  It's fucking horrible.  I want to go out and fucking run a few miles after I fucking arc one.  I shot a good one, too.  I was so fucking...  Dude, I was fucking...  Are you hearing what I'm hearing?  This is fantastic.  I had a single fucking towel.  Like a little paper towel.  Yeah.  Fucking on my chest.  Like a...  As I was about to blow a load, I was like to fuck a brawny towel strip.  You look like a slice of American cheese when you're talking about me.  It's like you...  When you get all dressed up for a wedding, but you still got to brush your teeth. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  And you have your tie on, so you put something down for the dribbles.  That is exactly what it was like.  The dribbles were coming from the other direction.  Yeah.  And I fucking...  I'm re-editing the burrito video that we made to make it just one big jerk-off fucking video.  I can't wait to fucking upload that.  I'm almost done.  Dude, it was like...  I didn't even come.  It was like my dick just threw up on me.  Oh, no.  It was like one of those where it doesn't even go far. 
[00:52:30]  It's just like...  It was a blurker blurker.  It was a wonderful one.  You brought to the show.  By the way, I just watched some tornado footage.  Sure.  That they showed.  They showed a tornado on the ground.  A tractor trailer on the road.  And I guess what happened is the tornado hit the tractor trailer because the fucking graphic  on the bottom of their cock screen from the news was up there taking up the entire  part of the action at the bottom of the screen where the tractor trailer got friggin' ripped 
[00:53:00]  apart.  These channels are pretty fucking big.  Why can't they have one guy on the button that goes, all right, just get rid of everything  for these five seconds.  You know what is about to happen.  All right, now put all the graphics back up.  They're so lazy, dude.  It's so important now to show video of these events.  Everybody has video now.  And what they do is leave that fucking graphic up.  Right.  Have one guy, an intern, that'll sit there and has a headphone and he goes, all right, 
[00:53:30]  we're going to this.  Get rid of the graphic for five seconds.  Get rid of the graphic.  Right.  And then you go, okay, graphic up.  And then the graphics back up.  Why the fuck are these idiots doing this?  Even go with an alternative graphic if you don't want to lose, you know, your logo.  Yeah, pop it in the corner somewhere or whatever.  Go with a tiny logo and get rid of everything else so you can see the actual video.  I missed the entire point of their video because they're dumb fucking shit at the bottom  of the screen.  I'm a big golf fan.  I like watching golf.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Golf highlights are the worst because it's always down at the bottom of the screen where  the cup is and you never see any of the fucking putts go in when they're doing highlights.  It's un-fucking-believable how dumb these idiots are.  Before we move on from Jimmy, I meant to bring this up yesterday, so I leave my building with  my kid the other day.  Yes.  And I run into Jimmy.  Did you have headphones on?  Because it's important.  I have my little headphones.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Because I had to say Jimmy about seven times before I got his attention.  Mike bit deef.  Yeah, I had my eye on.  Then I crossed the street and he goes, hey, man, I was just thinking about you. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  And I'm like, oh, that's nice.  Jimmy's thinking about me outside the show.  It's a nice thing to think about, right?  And I go, yeah, about what?  He goes, well, I was obsessing if I should be calling you Gregory as Ted.  No.  And then there's a second part of it.  And then he goes, I'm not really sure what I should be calling Anthony as Ted.  Should it be Anthony?  But I don't think Ted would do that, blah, blah, blah.  And I go, well, it's obviously Tony.  Ted would call Anthony Tony.  Oh, that would be good. 
[00:55:00]  Yes, yes.  He goes, ah, you're right.  No one calls me Tony.  He goes, I've been thinking about this, I don't want to exaggerate, for, what, an hour  or something straight?  Probably.  Because I have my headphones in.  And I was literally thinking of you as you called me.  Because I was thinking, I like calling you Gregory, because Ted uses proper names.  That's what he does.  You're Daniel.  Of course he does.  You're Gregory.  Yes, Eric's your proper name.  But because Anthony's proper name is Anthony, I already uses that.  Then you'd have to go the other way.  Yeah, but he just does that.  But I was thinking, Ant.  But he was bothered that Anthony didn't work. 
[00:55:30]  Tony didn't occur to me.  I just kept thinking, Ant.  You know, hello, Ant.  But it just sounds too, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good point, Gregory.  Tony, your hat is spectacular.  That just feels right.  Don't you care to fish your finger to the back of my pocket and have some Swedish meatball  in it?  Scrape a little off.  But that's...  But I gave you Tony.  You did.  And it made sense.  Because I'm like, it's obviously Tony.  Tony.  But he goes, I was obsessing about this.  I'm so glad I saw you.  I was listening as you...  All I've listened to in probably the last four days is there's a Motorhead song called 
[00:56:00]  Bomber, where they go, it's a bomber.  It's a bomber.  And it sounds like he's saying, it's Obama.  It's Obama.  It's Obama.  Oh.  And I fucking, even knowing the lyrics, I cannot stop fucking...  Really?  It sounds like...  It's Obama.  It's Obama.  It sounds like he's saying, it's...  Is this the song?  No, it's the live version.  Oh.  Not the one we watched.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, is that the only version in there, Iraq?  That's the only one in there. 
[00:56:30]  They don't have fucking the album Bomber in this shitty system?  I'm looking.  Hang on.  Oh, no.  Speaking of Obama, we'll do the Obama thing next.  Yes, yes.  We gotta take a break, but...  Obama's whirlwind tour.  An awkward moment for Obama, huh?  Yeah.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  We're trying to find this song real fast.  Yeah.  You two coming back, it takes a few seconds to get to.  All right, we can do that.  Yeah.  So, we got a busy day, obviously.  Malcolm McDowell will be in studio 930. 
[00:57:00]  Yes, and Brian Johnson, 9 o'clock.  And Brian Johnson, who has a great book out.  I love the book.  It's hilarious.  It looks like an easy read.  I had no interest in it at first because it's called Rockers and Rollers, a Full Throttle Memoir.  And it's all car pictures.  I have eggs in my mouth.  I apologize.  Why does it have all car pictures?  I'm a little confused.  He's a car.  You think Anthony's car obsessed?  But is it about his life?  That's where it gets confusing.  All right.  Sorry, I was chewing on that.  Does he use the cars to try to explain shit in his life? 
[00:57:30]  Every car picture has a story around it because he's been car obsessed his whole life.  So, there's actually a really cool story.  A lot of these he doesn't own.  They're just photos of the cars, I think.  And he has a story about everyone.  And he's a fucking hilarious writer.  And the stories are funny and interesting.  There's shit about the other band members.  It's like a biography that isn't boring.  Everyone ties into it.  But it's not fucking at all boring.  I mean, it's a very fucking big surprise how much I'm liking this book. 
[00:58:00]  I fucking went through 100 pages the first day.  I would love to know, and I don't even know if we asked this or he would answer the question,  what his cut is in ACDC.  I've heard rumors that he gets way less than the other guys.  Does he really?  But he's the reason why the band was able to continue at the level they're performing at.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But I've heard rumors that his cut is a lot less.  Because he's not an original, you know?  He's serious about his automobiles.  He really is. 
[00:58:30]  His automobiles.  But it's like, even, I don't like cars.  I don't care about them enough to read about them.  But this, it's fucking great.  I cannot stop reading this book.  You like the cars?  But I don't, oh, oh.  I don't, though.  I was listening to some of the tracks of the new album.  It sounds like something that they did 20 years ago.  Really?  It's not bad.  I'm confused by that.  I don't know who the audience is going to be for that. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Because the people that liked the cars back in the day,  I don't think their minds are open enough to enjoy new music.  Yeah.  I guess they were on Jimmy Fallon.  Yeah.  And Jimmy Fallon tweeted that they sounded great in rehearsal.  Yeah.  So then I felt guilty because we beat the shit out of them.  Well, we certainly did.  It just seems weird to put out a new album as the cars in 2011.  And have it sound exactly like the 80s version of the cars.  But whatever.  I was thinking greatest hits with two new songs.  That old gag.  But they decided brand new album from beginning to end. 
[00:59:30]  Good for them.  We'll have to pay attention to see if that works for them.  Who are we to say?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Want to eat?  I certainly do.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  CM Hutch on Twitter just tweeted this.  Please tell me you saw the commercial speaking out against the R word last night. 
[01:00:00]  Where was that?  I know they're trying to take away a lot of words.  I know on Dancing with the Stars, it was on.  And I'm being honest.  I don't watch the show.  But it was on in my house.  Okay?  I swear to you.  Mysteriously, so many things just happen to be on.  I admitted yesterday.  Does Lil Hudson get to the remote?  Is that what it is?  I admitted yesterday I watched Jerseylicious.  Yeah.  All right.  So I have no problem admitting some weird shit. 
[01:00:30]  But I really don't watch Dancing with the Stars.  I really don't.  But it was on as I was crashing.  And they were showing some clips.  And one of the dancers, I think.  Because I don't know who's.  I don't know if he was a dancer or a celebrity.  Because the celebrities are barely celebrities.  And the dancers, you don't know because you're not in the dance world.  So I don't know.  Well, somebody used the word, well, that's retarded.  Oh, shit.  And I said to my wife, I'm like, oh, that's going to be a problem tomorrow.  But I haven't seen it in the paper where anyone was talking about it.  Because you just can't say retarded in the mainstream media. 
[01:01:00]  Who said that on Dancing with the Stars?  Somebody.  I don't know who it was.  Because I really don't watch the show.  Can't say retarded.  I guess they were like practicing some kind of dance thing.  And someone suggested something.  This is how much attention I was.  But I did hear the word.  It made me pop up.  Like, what the fuck?  And, yeah, she said, that's retarded.  Oh, someone probably said, go stick your tongue in that outlet.  How are some of these paint chips?  What's that?  But where was the R word commercial?  Because now I want to hear it. 
[01:01:30]  The R word.  I don't know.  I think I've seen a couple of these.  They're like the same type of bullying ones.  And bullies politically correct fucking PSAs.  The one I did see.  Fruits.  Because I'm watching the NBA playoffs.  And, fuck, I was telling Ant before the show, he doesn't care about basketball.  But the Miami Heat put that super team together.  Yeah.  And they're one game away from playing in the finals.  And everybody.  Everybody.  Except if you're in Miami, wants LeBron James to lose. 
[01:02:00]  I was pissed off at this because they put the team together.  So now we've got to hope that Dallas is ready to finally win a championship.  Because it looks like it's going to be Dallas and Miami.  But the NBA has a bunch of stars saying that's gay is not good.  Athletes.  And when I was growing up, the athletes, that's what we said.  The ones that use it the most.  And we didn't know what the gay world was about.  You just said it.  Like, we've said a million times in this show.  Oh, that's gay.  Or stop being a faggot, even though we didn't even know what that meant. 
[01:02:30]  It didn't mean homosexuality.  It just meant, you know.  But now the NBA has a campaign, if you can find that one, where a whole bunch of really  fucking big NBA stars are saying, you know, that's not cool to say something's gay.  That's not cool to say something's gay.  That's fine.  Something's gay.  It's gay.  And then you see gay guys, and they'll go, oh, that's gay.  And they're not even talking about butt sex.  And then they'll say, stop being a faggot.  And they're not talking about butt sex.  No, call each other girls.  The one time they're not.  Queers.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  But it's one of those.  They use the word queer all the time.  Jimmy has the best rap on this.  I mean, it's just dumb when we're not allowed to say the N-word, but black people are.  It's so stupid.  And Jimmy's whole take on it, you should be allowed to say all this, because there are  consequences.  If you say the N-word to the wrong person, you could fucking lose your teeth.  But to actually tell people they're not allowed to use a word is so ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Everything has its time, place, and context.  Right.  That's what I say.  Right. 
[01:03:30]  Did I...  I said that correctly, right, Jimmy?  Because I love your take on that.  Absolutely.  I think there's social consequences.  There's social consequences.  Michael Richards probably should have gotten punched for what he did, because he just called  people niggers angrily.  He wasn't trying to be funny.  He was angry.  And if you do that angrily, you know, you've got to take a hit for that, because that's  a fucking...  Is this it?  That's a rough one.  Wow.  Look at all the dislikes.  That's because people, like, stop fucking with language.  Yeah.  I like seeing that on YouTube.  Yep. 
[01:04:00]  This video, because we're about to show the Think Before You Speak PSA, 403 likes, 508  dislikes.  By the way, think before you speak is the exact wrong message with retarded.  They don't think before they do anything.  Think before you make a lot of noise.  Think before you shit your pants.  Think before you throw rocks through the window.  Think before you eat the cat food.  Leave it for the cat food.  Think before you jump up and down and go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  People are watching television. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, the R Word commercial was on the NBA playoffs.  I didn't watch it last night.  I was too busy watching Dance with the Stars.  Think before you hold that baby under the fucking bathtub water.  Oh, shit.  Think before you put your full weight on the infant.  Is that the PSA?  Yeah, here it is.  This is the one I'm talking about, which I was so disappointed to see this.  It's just ridiculous.  Well, it's my block party.  Glad you can make it.  The only triple doubles you get come with fries.  Last time you blocked someone, you were online. 
[01:05:00]  I can do this all day.  Your moves are just gay.  Using gay to mean dumb or stupid, not cool.  Not cool.  Not in my house.  Not anywhere.  It's not creative.  It's offensive to gay people.  And you're better than that.  No, I'm not.  It's disgusting.  I'm better than that.  Well, people should...  It's fucking disgusting.  And I think the gay community doesn't need...  They don't need their fucking help. 
[01:05:30]  I would imagine it would be embarrassing to them that this is out there.  Don't say that.  If it's something stupid, that's gay.  Your moves are gay.  Well, words could have two different meanings.  I think so.  Of course they can.  Of course they can.  Queer eye for the straight guy.  Yep.  Why is it okay for the group in question to embrace stereotypes and utilize them when they  see fit, but not cool for other people?  It's this fucking entitled self-obsession that people have with wanting to control what other 
[01:06:00]  people say and think about them.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, there's a show called Queer Eye...  For the straight guy.  For the straight guy.  It was about...  Well, how come they didn't mind...  Because gay people are more fashionable than straight people, I guess.  How come they didn't mind that stereotype?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Why was that embraced?  You gotta drag a bunch of gay guys in there to gussy you up.  Why was that embraced?  Why would they say that we're no more fashion-oriented than anybody else?  I was embarrassed to see them go, not cool.  Not cool. 
[01:06:30]  Was that a player or just fucking...  Oh, yeah.  Who was it?  Who was it?  Who was it?  Yo.  Who was that?  Was that Grant Hill?  Yeah, that was Grant Hill.  Yeah, because I'm sure he never says faggot.  There's a few others in there, too.  But yeah, Grant Hill goes, not cool.  I'll believe the NBA's sincerity when a couple of players come out, or baseball and a couple  of players come out of the club.  Then I'll believe the sincerity of that sport.  But if you tell me that not one gay player in the NBA...  Yeah.  And they probably don't feel comfortable coming out because they'd get fucking ridiculed.  Right.  Yeah, it's gay.  You know, in hockey, that's my sport these days. 
[01:07:00]  What's your Montreal Canadian guy?  He used to be on the Islanders.  Wisniewski?  Yeah.  Remember we talked about how he gave the blowjob fucking thing?  Yeah.  And he got...  I think he got a few game suspension, right?  And he got a fine for doing the blow...  We bought the blowjob fucking...  The universal blowjob with your hand signal.  Yeah.  And then Chara almost takes someone's head off.  Yeah.  And a lot of people think it was a really vicious, intentional hit.  He got nothing.  He got nothing for that.  That's what they think about in the sports world. 
[01:07:30]  Doing the universal sign for blowjob to another fucking man really bad for the kids.  It's worse.  But watching a hockey player almost behead somebody in a game on purpose, some people  say, by the way, because they do argue this point, the guy got...  Chara got nothing, right?  He didn't get suspended or nothing for that hit.  I didn't know Chara behaved that way.  She was always so nice.  Chara.  The coochie, coochie girl.  The coochie, coochie girl.  That's just ridiculous.  I think there's like a...  They're pumping pollen through the air conditioning system. 
[01:08:00]  I swear.  Look at you.  I'm like, my eyes all of a sudden started running and my nose...  He's about to go catch him.  Oh, Chip.  Yeah, you look like you're dripping.  And my nose is like stuffed up.  It's amazing.  And I'm fine, finally.  It really is crazy.  My allergies, finally, after three fucking weeks of sneezing.  Nothing better than hopping in your car, looking at the hood, and just seeing...  Green.  Like you're driving the Green Lantern car.  Fucking just green powder everywhere.  Do you know that comedian that's always got allergies? 
[01:08:30]  Who?  What's his name?  Pollen Quinn.  Pollen Quinn has been on fire on Twitter.  Oh, his tweets are hysterical.  Did you read his tweets from Cannes?  From Cannes Film Festival?  The Cannes Film Festival?  Yeah, I was reading those.  Where he was rubbing elbows with the A-listers?  Yeah.  I guess last night he was having a fucking Scorsese film festival at his house or something? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because he was commenting on Raging Bull and then Casino and shit.  And he's just like...  I like the moment where he brings up the Jew motherfucker.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I can't read it verbatim or remember it verbatim.  The big comeback was...  He was saying the casino would have been better if...  Yeah.  If when Pesci said, you Jew motherfucker, De Niro said, hey, look who's talking for all  we know.  You could be one.  Yeah.  And then walks away.  That would be the big line.  Didn't he say he likes watching the movies on commercial TV? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's not his blue or whatever.  He likes it that way?  Yeah.  Fucking Colin.  I mean, Twitter was made for someone like Colin and Norm Macdonald, those fucking guys.  Some were nooses and fucking rafters.  You know, Colin...  Colin's gay.  Yeah, he is.  In the literal sense.  He adores cock.  In the Latin sense.  The way one adores the sun.  Yeah.  From X.  Colin is the new expression that's fucking horrendous. 
[01:10:00]  He says, who gives a care?  No.  Who gives a care?  Yeah.  Oh, who gives a care?  It's fucking terrible.  Oh, God.  Oh, Glee had the R word commercial.  Glee?  Because everything on that show is gay.  Oh, God.  Yes.  Fuck.  You look at that show and...  Have you seen Glee?  I swear to God, I haven't even watched it to see what all the...  The ads for it.  I can't sit through.  Yeah.  It's just infuriating.  Ugh. 
[01:10:30]  Glee.  I gotta hear the R word commercial now.  Yeah.  I definitely wanna hear that.  I don't know.  The R word.  Travis got it.  This is the R word.  Was this on Glee last night?  Is this the one?  It looks very similar to the G word campaign.  The G word.  I got it.  What, what, what?  Colin's talking about what would make movies better.  Yeah.  And I guess he's on The Godfather.  He goes, then they could make fun of Tom Hagen with some bald jokes.  They could say, you're not a wartime consul, Yari Curly. 
[01:11:00]  Fucking Colin.  What is it?  I am Colin?  I am Colin Quinn.  Quinn on Twitter if you wanna follow him.  He's a hoot.  Before, and I gave Justin Stengel from Letterman, head writer of Letterman.  Yeah.  He's got, uh, he's got Twitter bit of the day, my friend.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, cause he's, there's a hashtag that's, uh, that, that it says just, uh, uh, oh, fuck. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, Justin.  Thank you, Travis.  Oh, yeah.  And he's making believe to the Justin Bieber fans that, that they're all praising him.  That it's him, right.  A middle-aged fucking head writer for David Letterman.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's just, will not acknowledge that it's not about him.  Did he get annoyed?  It's Justin Bieber.  It's hilarious.  And then the fucking Bieber fans are getting fucking pissed off cause they're trying to tell him,  we're not talking about you, we're talking about Justin Bieber.  I noticed the Biebs, I noticed the Biebs on, uh, the Billboard, uh, Music Awards there  the other day.  Yeah.  Uh, he comes out and, uh, he's, he's still, uh, a kid. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  But he's, his, his facial features are getting a little more chiseled and manly.  A little more defined.  I think he's gonna start rapidly losing that, uh, audience.  Oh, yeah.  That really, uh, clings to him.  See, that's the boyish Bieber face there.  But then, uh, I don't know, he, he's kind of looking a little more manly.  My prediction, he's got one more year.  That's it.  One more year?  We'll see how he makes the transition. 
[01:12:30]  Once he starts getting whiskers.  And he walks away with a shitload of money and hopefully he, uh, you know, he fucking  invested wisely because I, I, I don't see a long-term career for him whatsoever.  That fucking, uh, that babe.  Selena Gomez.  Selena Gomez.  I've been team Selena Gomez for years.  She looks.  You're finally getting it.  Oh, I'm finally on board with her.  Good.  She, uh, yeah, she looks great.  Maybe that's what it is.  Maybe it's that Selena Gomez vag juice on his, uh, face.  Yeah, but.  That's manly-ing him up a bit.  What I pointed out to you, and I, I will tweet this picture. 
[01:13:00]  Uh, you got Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber.  I guess they're going out, but obviously it's a fake relationship, but no one wants to talk  about it.  Yeah.  Because it, it's very good for both of their careers.  Of course.  And the people behind them that make money off these two, to have these two as a couple.  People, I, I, I would bet a lot of money this is not a real fucking couple, but they're  on vacation, uh, together in Hawaii.  In Hawaii.  And you just look at this picture that's in the paper today.  She's ridiculous how hot she is.  Yeah.  And, uh, and Bieber looks like a little boy.  Yeah.  Like, what is he doing with that? 
[01:13:30]  Meaning, he can't, he can't.  He's bigger than she is, though.  He can't handle that.  She probably likes the fact that he's bigger than she is.  He's more popular.  He's a boy.  This fucking broad wants, wants an animal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She needs a sound fucking.  You think he knows what to do with that?  No.  That's my point.  I bet he just jizzes like the second he, she pulls her pants down and he goes, oh.  But that's in the imaginary world.  Cause I don't think, I don't think any of that's going on. 
[01:14:00]  No.  But if it was, you're, you're right.  That's what would happen.  Yeah.  And she's just there.  Oh, it's, it's okay.  Mm-hmm.  And she needs a big fucking, fucking cock.  Would ya?  Pussy.  Would ya?  Yeah.  What you gotta do is you kiss her stomach, you get all the way down, and then you kiss  the legs.  And then you kiss the front of the panties and you work your way into that pussy.  Yeah.  The fucking, this is annoying me.  They're holding hands. 
[01:14:30]  This fucking, the way this shitty band started playing when Obama was toasting.  Oh, no, no, no, wait.  We were going to talk about that.  You're a sucker.  We'll, we'll talk about that in a second, but, uh, Travis has got the R word thing.  Oh, the R word.  Yeah, he's a fucking royal jacket.  He had to put his drink down.  Oh, he looks.  Oh, you want to do it now?  It's fine.  It's so awkward.  No, I want to hear the retard thing.  Okay.  And then we'll talk about that.  Here's the retard thing that I guess was on Glee last night.  From one retard to another.  So we lost the N word.  It's not acceptable to call me a nigger.  Oh.  It's not acceptable to call me a snake.  Oh, is that for a second?  Hold on.  It all depends on what you're doing, sir. 
[01:15:00]  Hold on.  That is, that is true.  It's unacceptable.  Why would the guy set himself up like that?  No, but by the way.  And look, they, they, they found the perfect black guy to say that.  Yes.  But look at how phony it is.  Why is he not saying N word?  Why is, why is he allowed to say that?  Allowed to say nigger.  Why is the impact of that word allowed to be used to, to forward a message that somebody  else considers appropriate, but you can't use that to forward a joke or to forward, it's  so fucking fraudulent. 
[01:15:30]  It is.  Drives me nuts.  Anything can be used in the right context.  Exactly.  And that is actually a good context to use it in.  Why not have a white guy though, sitting there going, it's inappropriate for me to call  him a nigger.  Right.  Or to think of it while he's talking.  Yeah.  Something.  Even though he's my boss, to just think that the whole time he's talking, you think nigger,  nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger.  Oh, well, you can't say nigger unless you're using a positive PSA, right?  It's a positive PSA.  That's what the rules are.  So the N word was not banned.  Nigger wasn't banned.  It is allowed.  Is that television?  Or is it YouTube?  It's not on TV though. 
[01:16:00]  I think if we found it, this aired during Glee yesterday.  Or maybe a different version of this.  Because yeah, I'm pretty surprised that this would actually air on regular TV.  I don't know.  If someone knows the answer to that, please let us know.  I guess he's never driven in front of me.  It's not acceptable to call me a nigger.  It's not acceptable to call me a spick.  To call me a chink.  To call me a fag.  It's not acceptable to call me a kink. 
[01:16:30]  And it's not acceptable to call me a retard or call yourself or your friends retarded.  The R word is the same as every minority slur.  Print it that way and don't use it.  Spread the word to end the word.  I love their catchy little things.  Spread the word to end the word.  See, here's the thing.  I use, by the way, every one of those words on an hourly basis.  I'm the same person.  Yes.  Fucking retarded nigga chink. 
[01:17:00]  You're driving like a kike.  What are you doing, you fucking broad cunt mick?  God damn you, Guinea.  You know what?  I'll tell you what happened is the retarded girl, they probably didn't want to do that PSA.  Yeah.  But they kept probably telling her to say, you can't make fun of the fact that I'm mentally challenged.  All right.  Action.  Don't call me a retard.  We have to build something around this.  Stop with the fucking mind policing PSAs.  God, are they irritating.  It really is like, stop giving these words so much power. 
[01:17:30]  It's like, believe me, I'd be the last one to go out and punch a retarded guy in the face  or a gay gentleman, a gay bashing.  I would never do that.  Absolutely.  But to use the word, that's fine.  Just stop it already.  People just can't.  But here's the problem, though.  And this is why it happens.  When somebody gets in trouble for it, nobody sticks up for them. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  If people, like everyone's so disgusted that has 500 and something dislikes, if there was  backlash for somebody using gay out of those 900 people, 400 would complain, five of the  dislikes would stick up for the guy who said gay.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  People who target you, nobody fucking sticks up for you.  Right.  You've got to believe a lot of those dislikes are people that don't like people fucking  with their language in general.  They don't have a problem with retarded people or gay people or any of that shit.  No. 
[01:18:30]  They have a problem with, you know, people fucking with the language.  Because where does it end?  I don't know if I've ever called a gay guy a faggot angrily.  I mean, I really don't know if I've ever said that or to a black guy.  I don't know if I've ever, even if you don't get beat up to a black woman, I don't know  if I've ever said that in anger to a black person.  I don't need to be told that.  No, no.  None of us need to be told that.  But don't fucking crucify me if I use it in humor and that guy uses it in a PSA and  that's acceptable.  That's what drives you crazy.  And what's her name there?  She's an old school comic. 
[01:19:00]  She probably used it.  Who is she?  She was in 40-year-old.  What's her name?  She just blew up out of nowhere, man.  But she's an old school fucking comic.  I didn't know she was a comedian.  I'm sure she used all those words in her act over the years.  But why is a comedian?  Is that her daughter?  No, no.  Why is a comedian fucking talking?  Well, she's one of the stars of Glee.  I know that much.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Let me hear the girl again.  Let me hear the girl talking.  She seems very sincere.  Be a retard or call yourself or your friends retarded when they do something foolish. 
[01:19:30]  The R word is the same as every minority slur.  Treat it that way and don't use it.  Spread the word to end the word.  But like, isn't that...  You can't spread the word to end the word.  Why is it not okay to say that?  Like, she's mentally retarded.  Like, why is that such a bad, terrible thing to say?  Mentally retarded.  That's what the word is.  Yeah.  It's retarded.  Like, it's not a bad thing.  Like, that's just what you are.  We've got to just make believe we're all exactly the same.  Their argument would be the negative connotation... 
[01:20:00]  Not my problem.  No, no, I agree.  But I mean, that's what they're...  If you said that to one of them, it would go,  Well, retard has just become this thing to mean negativity and stupidity  and the dignity of mentally retarded, which is the honest...  That's the fucking angle that throws me.  Yeah, but he used the word retarded is so gay.  To me, this PSA is like incredibly offensive  because basically they're kind of justifying...  They're saying, hey, I'm a nigger or I'm...  You know what I'm saying?  Like, that's...  Yeah, yeah.  So, to me, I look at that and I go, holy Jesus.  Like, retarded is so not to that extent that the anger is not. 
[01:20:30]  And another woman calling herself a spick and things like that.  It's like, retarded is...  Really?  Retarded?  It's nothing.  Good old Andy Levy, I guess, on Red Eye made a fantastic point according to Take the Wig.  Last week, he said that policing slurs and racist language is really policing thought  and you can't break into that world of policing thought.  It's dangerous.  That's brilliant.  I'll ask him about that quote tonight when I am on Red Eye. 
[01:21:00]  You're on Red Eye tonight?  Oh.  This evening.  Yes.  Yes.  I have no idea.  You guys see this commercial yet?  I don't remember that.  That looks familiar.  What happened?  What did I miss?  Just a bunch of people standing on luggage.  Standing on luggage.  Hotel commercial.  It's for a hotel and a couple of people standing on luggage.  That's all.  I just think it's clever.  That commercial aired with the N-word.  Yeah, they said it last night.  See, the selective, the fucking, if you go, if what, and again, I apologize for babbling 
[01:21:30]  about the same thing, but if what you're saying goes fucking hand in hand of the popular  ideology of the moment, you can say it.  If it doesn't, you can't.  That's why this offensive language is so fucking phony.  Yeah.  It's phony.  If you try to do a joke with the word nigger or spick, the network would crucify you.  But you can say it if it's in a good PSA.  Sure, because it's a message that they deem appropriate.  Yeah.  Like, if you were trying to say something for gay marriage, like, let's say you were saying 
[01:22:00]  the message wasn't as positive in the mind of the network as the retard message, then  they would not let you do it.  They wouldn't let you use it.  If it was a message they deemed inappropriate or not as important.  Which, by the way, they're policing for context, then.  And then who's to say their idea of the context is the right one and a comics is wrong?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  It's transient.  It changes, and that's why you can't ever fucking respect it.  And they decide which words are bad.  They left out, like, uh, uh... 
[01:22:30]  Mick, Guinea, Dago, the Muslims.  Those are acceptable.  Are there any sand...  Oh, Sandega, they didn't say right.  They didn't go with dot heads, none of that stuff, so...  They didn't even touch on those.  You can't fit them all in.  Would have been fun.  Nice fucking hour-long PSA.  That was Jane Lynch.  Of course, I was Jane Lynch.  I just couldn't think of her name.  Jane Lynch is a very funny broad, and I'm sure she's used a lot of those words to get  where she is today.  Where's the white guy going, don't call me Cracker?  I don't like being called a Cracker.  A honky. 
[01:23:00]  I don't mind that commercial.  It doesn't bother me.  It's only, if there wasn't penalties the other way, I would think that's a good commercial.  Yeah.  Like, all right, retarded people don't want to be shit on, but the fact that there's so  harsh penalties, and those words are so frowned on, it's like, how dare you fucking selectively  use spick and kike and nigger and chink to get you...  Where's the Asian groups?  Where are the fucking Asian groups...  Where are they protesting, because the word chink has been used, hijacked, to fucking  promote another cause? 
[01:23:30]  Right.  How fucking dare the network make that decision, that those words are acceptable because this  message is okay?  It was used for shock value, too.  Of course it was.  They wanted to get your attention before they got to the retarded girl.  All you fucking phonies out there that think that attacking the Catholic Church is really  speaking truth to power, stop it.  Please.  This is so irritating.  Yeah.  Sorry I'm being preachy.  I'm just tired.  No, it's fine.  The...  No, it's good stuff. 
[01:24:00]  You were talking about Michael Richards.  Did you see...  Did you happen to see the Michael Richards crazy naked subway guy video?  I heard about that.  No, I didn't see it.  What?  There's a Michael Richards crazy naked subway guy video where they're just going back  and forth with each other.  Oh, that's great.  The famous subway video where the guy got naked?  I think it's Kramer vs. Crazy or something.  Right?  Kramer vs. Crazy. 
[01:24:30]  It's like Kramer vs. Kramer.  Oh, there.  That's probably right.  Is that it?  Niggas!  The nigger!  Niggas!  He's a nigger!  Niggas!  He's a nigger!  Niggas!  The nigger is over to the nigger!  There's a splicing between the subway guy and Michael Richards.  Niggas!  The nigger!  Niggas!  He's a nigger!  Niggas!  He's a nigger!  Niggas! 
[01:25:00]  But you know what?  Were black people attacking that guy or did they realize he's just jaded?  No, they were just laughing.  They know he was crazy.  They were laughing at him because he's crazy.  They were laughing.  They were laughing at Kramer.  No, no, no.  They were not laughing at Kramer.  I don't think his career should be ruined for that.  Like, whatever career he had.  But, you know, it's like when you yell at a fucking table of black people because you  can't handle being heckled.  It's like, that's the atomic bomb, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've been heckled by black people and you want to believe me.  You want to be hurtful.  But it's never been tempting to even say that. 
[01:25:30]  No, no.  That is like, it's over the top.  Because honestly, you can't look at that word and think that it is the same as cunt or  asshole.  Like, it does have a connotation and a historical meaning that's fucking different.  But it doesn't mean that you should be penalized and fired.  And it doesn't mean you can't use it under any circumstance whatsoever.  That's the thing that doesn't make any sense.  I agree.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to talk about Obama and his trip over there to England.  Obama. 
[01:26:00]  I didn't know he was Irish.  I'm confused by that.  Yes.  Very Irish.  I mean, held up that pint.  Very confused by that.  Yes.  Very Irish.  They were putting Obama and then they were putting the little comma thing there.  The apostrophe.  Excuse me.  Apostrophe.  Oh, Obama.  They're pretty witty, huh?  Oh, very.  The virus.  Virus.  Call the Opie and Anthony show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[01:26:30]  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Calling this campaign, trying to crack down on anti-gay bullying.  All right.  A judge giving one.  Yep.  Yeah, we just missed it.  CNN.  A Chicago Bulls player was fined for using the word faggot.  Yeah.  In the heat of battle.  Oh, my God.  In the heat of battle.  I don't know the player's name.  I'm sorry. 
[01:27:00]  Anyway, but they showed it.  Yeah.  He went back to the bench and yelled, faggot.  And they pixelated his mouth as he was saying it.  Yeah, yeah.  You can still see that that's the word he said.  In the heat of battle, they're now fining these guys.  You're supposed to really try to think about what you're about to say when you're mad.  Yeah, you're mad.  You're being competitive.  Everyone knows when you're mad, you say some awful shit.  You almost can't help it, right?  Yeah.  But now a player could be fined for saying something in the heat of battle. 
[01:27:30]  That's crazy.  It's just really weird out there.  Yeah.  What's going on with Malcolm McDowell?  This has become a big thing here.  They're setting up tables, and Roland got involved.  The table's got to be moved because publicists got to sit there for the Malcolm McDowell interview.  Now the table's moved somewhere else.  The table, just have the table.  What's going on with the table, Iraq?  I agree that we should not have it with merchandise on it when they walk up.  I don't want that at all.  No.  It's tacky.  It really is.  I see you set up a nice table for Jim Norton's merchandise to be signed. 
[01:28:00]  But honestly, I don't need that.  I can do it right here.  Yeah.  And now I see the table has been moved.  You were doing the right thing, I guess.  Well, I had it set up over here, but with publicists and everybody else who's coming in,  we didn't have anywhere else to put them in the hallway,  so we moved the table over to the right side over there  so that his handlers and everyone else can sit over there while we're doing the interview.  Handlers.  But now we're not laying anything out until after the interview?  No.  Because we don't want it to look like a sign. 
[01:28:30]  You can't look like an autographed sign.  I don't want to sound like the guy who does something.  Believe me, I think you do what you want.  It's just tacky if there's 30 things to be signed.  We can't do that.  I was just going to put it right here in the corner and take this furniture out so Jim can lay out his...  No, I don't mind.  There should be no display of stuff ever when a guest comes in.  No, no.  Like, I can get mine done right here.  Believe me, I'll get my stuff.  I'm not worried about that.  I know how to ask him.  I'll just, hey, could you...  But when they've got to do 30 things, it's like fucking...  If each guy's holding something, hey, could you sign that?  It's a personal thing. 
[01:29:00]  It's different.  It becomes a signing.  I understand.  This was just to set the table up, not put everything else on it for when he's here.  This was just, you know, the table's ready.  We don't have much time.  Just miscommunication there because Roland was like adamant that Jim could throw his shit on this place.  Yeah, I know.  I was talking with Roland.  Is that what?  He was pretty adamant.  He felt that you wanted all your stuff out and ready to go.  No, not at all.  The table was just supposed to be set up so that when this was done, if we don't have much time,  Jim could throw his stuff out and be ready to go.  I will get my stuff.  I'm not worried about it.  I'll ask him.  I'll be sitting right next to him. 
[01:29:30]  I'll be like, would you mind?  And he'll sign it.  It will be fun.  I mean, even I'm not panicked about that, but I don't want to leave stuff out.  When we had the old studio, when we had the old XM studio, there's a place like we had  Heaven and Hell was in with Dio and Naomi and those guys.  We had a giant fucking facility.  A giant table.  So you can put a table to the side.  You don't even notice it's there.  No one even noticed it, but I just don't want him seeing 40.  Now you put a table out and people can't get by in the hallway.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Yeah, it's just.  Thank you, Sirius.  Thank you for allowing me to work here.  Thank you. 
[01:30:00]  It just becomes fucking unprofessional looking.  And there's a way to get stuff signed where everybody feels taken care of where it's  not.  And Roland got annoyed at me because I wanted the curtains closed.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like he's like, he's like, you're just being obsessive.  I'm like, I'm not being obsessive.  It's just like you're doing an interview half the time.  And I see you.  You're trying to talk to the person.  And if Roland pokes his head in, that's one thing.  He's got to go.  But you have these publicists just stand there fucking glaring at you through the glint.  It's annoying.  So your back is to the windows.  That's what I'm saying.  But I know.  You're lucky.  Because there are times me and Ann are like talking to these guys and all of a sudden 
[01:30:30]  you see hand signals like they're trying to wave the runner in.  I'm like, what's going on?  We're trying to fucking do our show.  I know.  But he tells me I'm being obsessive.  It's like, I don't give a fuck about the publicist.  If they can talk to Roland, then he can come in and tell us, look, he's got two minutes.  He's got to go.  So.  Where to go up on the computer?  So Roland needs the curtains open?  No.  Nobody needs it.  Whatever we want is what happens.  Yes, exactly.  So are the curtains going to be open or closed?  They're going to be closed.  And the table's going to be over there now?  And where's the merchandise?  We're not even going to use the table.  This is becoming a whole thing.  But it's not. 
[01:31:00]  But it's not.  I've got to be on my best behavior, too, I realize.  Yeah.  Can't mess up the big Malcolm.  The table was just there for Jimmy's convenience.  But I don't need it.  I love Iraq, although I don't 100% believe that.  I think he wanted to set his own stuff up there.  You've got stuff to sign, too?  I have one DVD.  But I mean, like, this stuff.  I know Iraq.  He's like me.  I can't shit on him.  He's got shit, too?  Of course he does.  He wants to set up all the stuff.  Is he a mini Jim Norton?  Do you really think that he wants to set up?  Do you think, I'm not going to get my stuff?  I'll fucking make him do it on the floor. 
[01:31:30]  Iraq's just more comfortable in front of a table.  But it's like a comfort zone.  I don't mind.  I'll ask right here at the table.  They're always cool after you talk to them.  You never want to ask before.  Not before.  It's very tacky.  Okay.  Hey, I have Cuth, believe it or not.  Who's turning this channel off today?  You've got to see how this all works out.  Hopefully not Brian Johnson and Malcolm McDowell.  Jimmy, very nervous.  Brought in a lot of stuff to be signed.  Yeah.  Spent $1,100 on Clockwork Orange things to be signed yesterday. 
[01:32:00]  I'm only getting two posters and one.  Maybe I'll get that program signed because he is in the movie.  But I really debated that.  You're debating what to be signed.  Maybe nothing.  I debated not getting that program signed.  But Ant was so adamant like he's in the movie.  He's the star of the movie.  But there's something beautiful about it.  You'll sign it or whatever.  But there's something beautiful about it like unsigned.  So buy another one unsigned.  You can't.  That's very hard to find.  A Malcolm autograph on something is not as rare to me as just that thing untouched. 
[01:32:30]  How bad do you want him to walk in with a cast on his right arm?  Oh God.  Oh my God.  That is funny.  But I almost didn't get this thing signed.  Sometimes things are...  You don't have anything signed.  I have stuff already in my apartment.  I've had him sign a photo of Caligula of himself.  He's already signed a DVD for me.  Oh, he's already signed stuff?  I met him at his signing.  I paid for it.  Oh, so this is easy today.  That's what I'm saying.  No pressure.  That's why I'm not freaked out.  This is just extra stuff to be signed.  Do you remember me? 
[01:33:00]  I was at a signing.  No.  I was online.  Malcolm.  And then I walked up.  This is where Big Kev...  He got me up to the front of the line and I got a photo with Malcolm.  And then the next time someone got it signed for me.  So I'm fine.  All right.  I'm all Malcolm down.  This is easy.  You're good then.  Yeah.  This is going to be easy today.  In other news, I hear E-Rock doesn't want to do the physical fitness challenge that's happening  Friday.  What is this?  On again, off again thing?  What the fuck?  What's going on, E-Rock?  An update on this.  Yeah.  Sam says a lot of shit.  Oh, shit.  Physical fitness challenge this Friday. 
[01:33:30]  Eric versus Sam versus Bobo.  Yeah.  Yesterday, Eric claimed he was not participating and would call out sick on Friday.  Yeah.  I said that.  What?  Sponsored by Pocono Raceway.  Three NASCAR fans will be attached to the contestants.  Fan attached to the winner will win two Skybox tickets to Pocono 500 race on weekend of June  10th and they'll get $1,000.  But Sam is telling me that E-Rock will call out sick on Friday and not participate in  the physical fitness challenge.  What?  Why is this? 
[01:34:00]  I thought you were in.  He threatened to do that yesterday.  Why?  He's afraid.  Who cares?  In for a penny, in for 400 pounds.  That's what I say.  You gotta be in.  Yeah.  We got one of the events is to have E-Rock run around the block with Sam.  Behind Sam.  Behind Sam. 
[01:34:30]  E-Rock.  I'm letting them get there laughing.  Let's go on for 10 minutes.  Oh, shit.  That was a home run.  It's just an old saying.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Anyway, so, it didn't want to, was told I was supposed to do this, didn't want to do  this.  Then, Roland agreed to participate. 
[01:35:00]  So, I said, okay, if he's doing it, I'll do it.  You did not.  You agreed to participate because I was doing it, not because Roland was doing it.  No, we agreed to do it before when the conditions were met about the other ship.  No, no, no, no, no.  Play back the tape.  You said, they said, will you go against Sam?  Yes.  And you said, yes, I will take Sam on.  Not, yes, I will do it if Roland is in it.  That's true.  You did not say anything about Roland.  There's money on the line here.  Yeah, and then it comes up to that, where it's like, all right, now we're going to bet  that E-Rock's going to win. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  I didn't want to do this to begin with.  Still on the 400 pound one?  Of course he is.  We lost Jimmy.  That made me laugh.  See, there's 200 bucks on the line.  Yeah.  Obi bet $200 that you would win.  I bet 50.  You bet 50 on E-Rock.  Poor, really dumb bet.  I have 200 bucks on Sam, and I actually, a little incentive for Sam, if he wins, I'll  take 150 of that and give Sam 50 bucks. 
[01:36:00]  And I made it clear that, I mean, 50 bucks to me, again, I'm not paid well.  That's huge.  Yeah, that's huge.  Who am I betting against?  Troy.  You're betting Troy.  Troy, yeah.  That's right.  Troy Kwan.  Yeah.  Fucking checkered sneakers.  Kwan Spears.  Where's the Troy Kwan production piece?  We've got to play that.  That's way too good.  So you're out, E-Rock?  You're going to call on sick Friday?  He's not out.  First of all, he committed to doing it, and not only is this something that you've betted  on, but this is like a sales promoted event for the show. 
[01:36:30]  It's an event.  It's got to be done.  I think E-Rock should at least be suspended if not fired from the company.  Wow.  Holy shit.  You're calling for a suspension?  Or firing.  Or firing.  And it's not like he hasn't done anything in the past.  Termination.  Wow.  You know what?  This brings up a bigger issue.  Why doesn't E-Rock like doing things for this radio show?  That's true.  Oh, E-Rock?  Comment?  E-Rock comment?  Great call.  E-Rock likes doing things for the show.  E-Rock's done a lot of things for the show.  Yeah, like what?  Yes.  Exactly.  I've almost died on cinnamon. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, that was a good one.  I almost died on mayonnaise.  I've eaten head cheese.  He's had his armpit hair ripped out.  I've had hot candle wax shots thrown at my skin.  That was a good one.  He had that, what was that hat made of?  Fluff?  Oh, there's the peanut butter hat, and then there's the fluff hat.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, so you've done a couple things.  And then I had to walk around the streets with the marshmallow hat in the Wonder Woman  outfit and a Snuggie.  All right, so you might have done a few things for the show.  Years ago, what have you done for me lately? 
[01:37:30]  What have you done for me lately?  You ruined a pair of pants with all that money in your pocket after winning the lottery  from the other guys.  Stealing lottery money from the rest of the staff.  Because the newspaper was for the show.  Right, it was a show newspaper.  Remember how red the whites of his eyes were after the mayo challenge?  I thought he was going to die.  That was worse than the cinnamon one.  There were two times I thought he was going to die.  The mayo and the cinnamon.  Oh, the cinnamon one, I thought we lost him.  I thought we lost him.  There should never be a point where we have to say there are two times I thought my producer 
[01:38:00]  was going to die.  Shut up, ball kicker.  Oh, shit.  That is true.  Oh, we're not supposed to bring that up.  That is true.  I know, that's what I heard.  Don't have a meeting now.  Gives a shit.  Oh, man.  Language.  Sorry, Travis.  Language.  Sorry, Travis.  Exactly.  I feel like I can make your fine point without fucking turning it on you.  Yes, Z-Rock.  I've taken grapefruit juice to the eyes.  Oh, grapefruit juice.  I don't remember that one.  Yeah, you got a video up.  Fresh squeeze.  I did?  Yeah.  I was just leaning back in the chair and you just squeezed grapefruit right into my eyes. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Could we redo that?  That sounds fucking cool.  Yeah, but with cum?  I really did like the yell he did when we ripped his armpit hair up.  When that woman that came in to do waxing actually waxed his armpit and then ripped the armpit hairs out all at once.  When I fell off the toilet and hit my head on the toilet paper roll.  He fell off the toilet because he was sitting on the toilet.  That's when our bathroom was like in the studio and we had the door open and he fell off the toilet and smacked his head against the holder for the toilet paper. 
[01:39:00]  And his scream is fantastic.  You did get your revenge on, what's her name though, when you spanked her really hard.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think she called you a motherfucker.  Pretty much hauled off and clocked some fucking chick, yeah.  What was her name again?  Justin Jolie.  Justin Jolie.  Justin Jolie, right.  All right, I guess we've done a few things.  I've done physical challenges in the past and we've all known that I'm not good at those.  Lost. 
[01:39:30]  He lost the push-up contest.  He was asked to lose weight by a doctor for his own health.  He actually put money on it and he lost that too.  Dr. Ian Smith, I remember that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He loses constantly when it comes to these challenges and that's why he's looking for a way out because he's going to lose again.  You're going to call out sick?  I thought about it.  He's not going to.  I lost my $200.  It's like driving toward a tornado.  I lost my $50.  Is this the truck driver?  No, this is...  I don't know.  I haven't seen that. 
[01:40:00]  Wow, that's crazy.  At least he's not driving toward a Tor Johnson.  Oh, Travis found E-Rock getting waxed when he hits his head.  Oh, okay.  It's a compilation of the entire thing.  It's 50 seconds.  Oh, great, great.  I love this.  That's fine.  Hit it.  Ah!  Fuck!  Ah!  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Whoa!  Regular radio.  Regular radio.  Right in it.  Oh, he had a curse.  Ah!  Ah!  Did I hear a curse?  Ah!  He cursed again!  Again! 
[01:40:30]  Ah!  Did he think something inappropriate?  Wait, what?  Ah!  Oh, God.  Ah!  E-Rock, you cursed.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:41:00]  He fell off the toilet.  He's crumpled.  That is fantastic, man.  I forgot how great that is.  I haven't heard that in years.  Oh, Cinnamon Challenge is brutal.  This is audio of someone almost dying on our show.  Yeah, yeah.  We all went into panic mode.  I have a one-minute clip from Cinnamon Challenge.  You want to hear that?  Yeah.  Ready?  One, two, three, go.  Hold on, hold on.  It needs to set up, I guess.  E-Rock.  We learned that... 
[01:41:30]  Honestly, for the first time, we rarely do this.  Please do not do this.  Yeah, don't do this.  Do not do this one.  Very dangerous.  We're telling you ahead of time, do not do this.  But we learned that it's really hard to just swallow a whole tablespoon of cinnamon.  Of cinnamon, yeah.  And we're like, that's stupid.  Of course you can do that.  No, your throat just decides it's not going down.  It's not going down, and then somehow it gets in your lungs.  How did it get in your lungs again?  One, it was piled a little too high, and then Bob Kelly just shoved it to the back of my throat.  Instead of me tasting it off the spoon, it just went right in there, and it went up my nose, into my eyes. 
[01:42:00]  Into your lungs.  My lungs.  That's what you're about to hear here, which is so creepy.  Honestly, do not try this one.  Never.  You're not fucking around.  This was a scary day.  We're what you call professionals.  Well, of course we're not.  Bob, whenever you see it, Bob sees a spoon goes towards the mouth that just has to be shoved in as hard as humanly possible.  To cover up for something that happened.  All right, let's hit this there, Travis.  Ready?  One, two, three, go. 
[01:42:30]  Okay.  Buck it up.  Iraq is attempting...  You all right, Iraq?  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking.  What is it?  You all right, Iraq?  How is it?  He's like that old wrestler.  Water, you asshole.  Holy shit, a whole cloud came out.  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water, water, water, water.  Breathe slow. 
[01:43:00]  Through your nose, fuckface.  You all right?  He's too loud.  Jesus.  Breathe water.  Drink water.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  He's going to drink water.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Something just came out of his forehead.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead.  Iraq.  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It does.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  There's a cloud of cinnamon that went across the road. 
[01:43:30]  Iraq.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up.  Holy shit.  I forgot.  He said shut up to you.  I shut up, man.  Holy shit.  What was the biggest problem there?  You couldn't catch your breath, right?  Yeah, I couldn't breathe, but then also we found out you can't drink water because it  turns it into almost like cement.  A paste.  So it solidifies.  As soon as the water touches the cinnamon, it clumps up, and now it's not moving anywhere. 
[01:44:00]  So I started spitting out chunks.  He really sounded like he was dying there.  He was like, ugh.  Man.  I did that, too.  He ate the liquid ass.  Yeah, he tasted the liquid ass.  Well, we hope that you do the physical challenge on Friday.  Exactly.  Oh, you got that one, too?  It's a minute, I mean.  You know what?  I kind of like this fucking Iraq getting completely abused segment.  This is him tasting liquid ass. 
[01:44:30]  This shit is horrendous.  Smells terrible.  Like genuine farts.  Yeah.  Like liquidy, horrible diarrhea farts.  Like funk ass, like sweaty ass.  Oh, it's disgusting.  Ass.  Ugh.  All right.  One lousy drop to the Tonghi rock.  It has entered.  That's his face. 
[01:45:00]  He's not happy.  He's not happy.  There we go.  His face is beet red.  Holy shit.  He didn't swallow it, did he?  He just puked all over the place.  Oh, I hate this.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  He's redder.  He's redder than the cinnamon challenge. 
[01:45:30]  People that linger longer with him.  That was one drop.  He's puking all over.  Oh, my God.  Damn, Iraq.  Holy shit.  You all right?  Yeah.  He boofed so bad. 
[01:46:00]  Okay, look.  You think I'd be sinner?  Perhaps Iraq has done a few things for the program.  Now that we think about it.  I should have kept that poster, I'm thinking.  Fuck.  Yeah?  Yeah.  At least I could have done was keep his poster that got me.  His poster?  Poor Portly kid.  He's done so much.  Wow.  What if I just covered the existing bets?  Let's get out of here.  Come on, Iraq.  Are you that afraid of losing?  Are you that afraid of losing?  This is an easy thing to do.  No, I just don't want to do it.  Yeah, this doesn't involve, you know, yacking. 
[01:46:30]  This is easy shit.  Eating anything terrible.  You don't even put condiments on your head.  No.  It's just physical fitness.  I think he's getting flagged at home.  I'm not blaming her.  Oh, shit.  She's her husband.  She's like, what the fuck am I living with?  A stunt boy from Z100?  She wants to build a life.  Yeah, but are you like, is it, does it prove that you're a man that you have to pay your  bosses $250 to leave you alone?  Well, that really, yeah, that doesn't work out very well.  Do we have any more clips in there?  Fuck the physical challenge. 
[01:47:00]  There's plenty of clips.  What do you want?  You got the mayo?  Well, that's a long one.  The end of the mayo would be great if we got it.  We've been really good in the years of editing these down so that we can play them whenever.  Yeah.  I have Eric Dog Shock Collar?  That's 46 seconds.  We forgot about that.  All right, let's do this one.  All right.  What the hell?  The Michael Jackson movie.  You got 30 seconds to come up with any type of punchline about Michael Jackson.  If you don't do it in 30 seconds, you get shocked with an 8 out of 10 on the Dog Shock  Collar and go! 
[01:47:30]  Oh, him doing the virus.  Yeah.  Time's a ticking.  Michael Jackson's movie.  One punchline about Michael Jackson or Michael Jackson's movie.  Come on.  Don't dare yell out some hack Michael Jackson.  Come on.  15 seconds to go for one punchline from the virus.  Come on, virus.  You think you got one, virus?  Here he goes.  Got one punchline about Michael Jackson or Michael Jackson's movie.  Oh, no.  Four, three, two, one. 
[01:48:00]  We're back alive.  He fell down.  I remember that.  He just drops.  He fucking drops.  You can't even scream with that.  No.  All your muscles tense up and you just panic.  That was hilarious.  You just panic.  He went right down.  Wow.  Fuck, I'm sorry I didn't keep your poster.  I feel guilty of everything you've done for this show.  Anything else, Travis?  I have something called E-Rock Pukes Tippi Tom. 
[01:48:30]  I assume something happened with Tippi Tom.  I might have had to smell his ass or something.  Oh, shit.  Hopefully it's...  Oh, you remember E-Rock had to smell his leg.  Is that what it is?  Is that what it was?  Might have been.  Let's see.  All right, let's go.  E-Rock, take a look.  Turn around.  No, no, no.  Turn around.  E-Rock, come on.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Tell us what that is.  This is his foot.  Well, tell us what it is.  No ass.  No ass.  No ass. 
[01:49:00]  That's all the ass you do right now.  Remember that ass for a while.  Ow.  E-Rock, you all right?  Oh, I think I puked in my eyes.  He did.  He thinks he puked in his eyes.  Oh, God.  I miss Tippi Tom.  Oh, Tippi Tom.  Two years already.  Right around this time, I think. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  I think it was right around now.  Two years.  Lost him.  I bet he still smells.  Okay.  Probably smells better at this point.  Poor Tippi.  Is that it, Travis?  I have E-Rock Spanx, Justine Jolie.  Oh, yeah.  I wonder.  Yeah.  That would be a good one.  Because she was pretty cocky that day, saying, look, I like a little of this S&M shit.  She didn't expect to be assaulted.  She wanted a little sexy spank.  You know all those clips she just heard?  It all came out.  Yeah, it all came out. 
[01:50:00]  Exactly.  In this clip, it all came out, finally.  Go ahead.  Oh, ow.  Oh, mother fucker.  Mother fuck you.  E-Rock.  You cock sucker.  Are you shitting me?  She's fair skin, too.  You don't.  Oh, my God.  You're a son of a bitch.  Do you know how to fucking spank a girl, you douchebag?  Dude, you're supposed to tap.  This is the first time I've done it.  It's not like you're beating women up.  Fuck not. 
[01:50:30]  Ooh.  And see, here I was all thinking, and he got crack, too.  You should say no to crack, man.  Holy shit.  Didn't even get the whole ass cheek.  Went for the fucking crotch, too.  Son of a bitch.  There you learn.  Wow.  She was not happy.  You know what I heard in that clip I never heard before?  You go, and she's a fair skin girl, too.  Yes.  Like, it would be okay if she was a talker.  Exactly.  Fucking sick fuck.  It's just because instantly, the welt in the shape of a hand came up. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  It was fantastic.  Believe me, I was just trying to play, you know, the part there.  I loved that you should have clucked her in the face.  We might have to do an E-Rock special on the channel.  Oh, it's great.  I'll give you a choice if you want one more.  I have two different clips.  Okay.  I might do both at this point.  Well, you might as well.  This is doing, this is going well.  All right.  I'd love this.  E-Rock slaps fatty, or E-Rock gags on cock? 
[01:51:30]  What slaps fatty?  I guess we got to do that one first.  We got to play them both.  That was over at K-Rock.  I don't remember that one.  I think she wanted to be in the Fatty Pig Fatty contest.  Right.  Okay.  She came in, and I think we had her bend over the couch, and I had to wind up and just  spank her ass.  Okay.  Can we do Fatty Pig Fatty again?  I really want to bring that back.  A dollar.  What was it?  A dollar a pound?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But we could maybe do $10 a pound.  You just cupped a fart and... 
[01:52:00]  You all right?  We're in T-Rock's face.  Can we do Fatty Pig Fatty?  What's wrong with you?  Do we have to bring that to the salespeople?  I like that.  Yeah, you can't get money.  We can bring it up.  Maybe with Summer right around the corner, we have a scale, and we do it in Times Square  or something.  Ah.  Just bring the scale down so these monsters don't have to come up here.  And the one that weighs the most wins fucking whatever dollar amount per pound.  How about we pour oil on them and whip their fat bodies in front of everybody?  Tarn feather them.  The F-1.  Yes.  All right.  This is E-Rock slapping a fat chick, I guess. 
[01:52:30]  Pull the shirt up a little so more of the butt is exposed.  Just the underwear.  Yeah.  E-Rock's pulling up the big panties to get some...  There you go.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh!  Are you...  What is wrong with you?  Holy Jesus Christ.  What is wrong with you?  Oh my God.  You just assaulted her.  E-Rock.  What the F is...  I underestimated E-Rock. 
[01:53:00]  No, wait a minute.  You don't know how to spank a girl.  You don't spank a girl like that.  I completely underestimated him.  I have completely turned.  I'm on your side now, Brent.  Wow.  Did he whap her?  Was that after or before Justine Jolie?  I think that was before.  It was after.  It was before?  Before?  After.  Oh.  Oh!  She was in pain.  We got to find another girl that E-Rock could...  Yeah, could beat up.  Beat up.  Yeah, because we haven't had enough close calls with physical encounters.  We might as well have him fucking assault the chick. 
[01:53:30]  Maybe you can punch her in the cunt with brass knuckles on.  How about we don't do that?  My handprint raised off her ass.  I love Jimmy, the voice of reason.  Oh yeah, we forget.  The brass knuckles.  Yeah.  Me and I just forget.  I know.  Over and over again.  It just sounds so good.  Don't you remember waking up on a Tuesday at nine and going,  Oh yeah, I'm not late for anything?  And I'm not going to be for quite a while.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  We kind of forget from time to time, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I never forget that.  That's really funny.  Oh damn, she fucking howled. 
[01:54:00]  Should we do the final one?  E-Rock gags on cock.  I found two more aside from that.  Oh, two more.  Yeah, so yeah, what do you guys want?  What do you got?  Well, we got E-Rock gags on cock.  Yeah.  E-Rock smells Jim's belly button.  And E-Rock...  Uh-oh.  E-Rock sniffs Bobo's cock.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's the day you made Bobo cum.  You know, he really has done a lot.  You always got to end with the, you know, with Stairway to Heaven. 
[01:54:30]  So you got to go belly button, then the generic cock, and then the Bobo cock.  Bobo cock.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one.  All right, let's do belly button.  E-Rock, do you want a little belly button juice to fucking chipper you up?  You got some, Jimmy?  I don't know.  That'll straighten everybody out.  That will bring this all around.  Did you get a load in your gut last night?  Not that bad.  I'm so happy.  No, it smells more like shit. 
[01:55:00]  Your belly button smells like your hands holding.  I didn't say it wasn't a great night.  That was good.  Yeah, it was funny.  It wasn't that tragic, though.  No, we're all bummed that he wasn't chipper.  Yeah, I appreciate you poking fun at my body.  All right, go with the cock one.  It's just a mere centimeter away from his mouth.  Come on, you can do it.  He's holding the base of the shaft.  Feel the hair on that man's legs.  Smell it.  It was nice being engaged.  Head of the dick is very close to his mouth at this point. 
[01:55:30]  Smell the muscular man.  He's got his nose on it.  He's going down.  He gagged.  He gagged on the cock.  I forgot how gay we used to be.  Oh, very gay.  Not as gay anymore.  No, what happened?  And then finally, Bobo's cock. 
[01:56:00]  Is this the last one?  This is the last one.  All right, finally.  Okay, a little montage of what E-Roc has done for the show.  Go ahead.  Now, E-Roc, give a good sniff.  Get a good sniff.  We want you really close.  He's not going to push your face in.  You've got to get on your knees.  Point it at me.  All right.  Point it at me.  You're going on the side.  Give a good sniff.  Stay there.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Oh, God damn it.  Get close.  Real close.  And you've got to get right by the hair.  Get in there.  Right by the hair.  There we go. 
[01:56:30]  And give his eyes back off.  Can I pull my pants off, please?  I think E-Roc is going to puke.  Can I pull my pants off, please?  Can I pull my pants off, please?  Like a cartoon character.  Physical challenge Friday, huh?  Yeah.  We'll see if E-Roc's going to do it.  What do you mean we'll see?  He's committed to doing it. 
[01:57:00]  He said he would.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Did he like Hangover?  Maybe.  Yeah.  I liked it more than you did.  You did?  Yeah.  It wasn't, you know, epic by any stretch.  But, you know.  Compared to the first movie?  I mean, it wasn't as good as the first movie.  But if you liked the first movie, you'll like this one.  Sounds like it was the same thing.  Well, it's the Hangover.  I mean, what are they going to...  It's not new ground to tread.  Good point.  Good point.  Do you agree Tyson's cameo was a complete bust?  It was predictable.  But it didn't really go over. 
[01:57:30]  I like what he was doing to drum things.  That was fantastic compared to what happens here.  I like that.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  I read an article that 25% of the participants...  Oh, E-Roc could be in on this, too.  Of WrestleMania 7.  Remember WrestleMania 7?  Yeah, I heard that.  How many years ago was WrestleMania 7?  It would have been 91.  That's not 91 years ago.  No, no.  1991. 
[01:58:00]  20 years ago.  20 years ago.  That's not that long ago.  25% of the participants in WrestleMania 7, dead.  Wow.  A quarter of...  Dead.  Yeah.  Only 20 years ago.  And, you know, you're talking about a physical event, so obviously these guys are younger  and are supposed to be in shape, and 25% of them are now dead.  If you look at any other, well, I guess you can't really call it a sport, but any other  athletic activity and you go back 20 years, you're not going to find as many dead people.  I was going through the list, and I forgot that we had lost the big boss man. 
[01:58:30]  That was a tough one.  Because I used to like the boss man.  I mean, he's no, you know, macho man Randy Savage.  Well, no, but he had some heat for a while, the boss man.  Yeah, and he had a long career.  So run down this list real fast.  Well, there's the Texas Tornado, Kerry Von Erich.  He made it to 33, but then...  Nice.  And then he killed himself.  Oh, well...  I believe he was on his dad's ranch, and he went out in a sleeping bag on the ranch. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah?  And just offed himself.  How?  With a shotgun.  Wow.  Shotgun in a sleeping bag.  I think so.  At least he's thinking.  He keeps clean up nice.  Yeah.  Canada's strongest man, Dino Bravo.  I remember Dino Bravo.  Dino Bravo, yeah, yeah.  He was shot gangland style at the age of 44.  Now, how did that happen?  He seemed to have, you know, made some friends that he shouldn't have.  Ah, okay.  Keep your friends close. 
[01:59:30]  44 in a hotel room.  But other friends close, too.  Something.  What?  Andre the Giant, of course.  He made it to 46, but he was a large man.  Yes, he would have had problems.  Just a heart failure.  Yeah, I mean...  At 46.  Well, he was a massive guy.  His heart actually said, fuck this shit.  Yeah, exactly.  Joey Morella was a referee.  Gorilla Monsoon's son, as a matter of fact.  Really?  Yes.  Gorilla Monsoon's son? 
[02:00:00]  Gorilla had to bury his son.  Oh, that's a shame.  Who died at 31 in a car accident.  Wow.  Jesus.  The British Bulldog, of course.  Oh, right.  Davey Boy Smith.  Sure.  Davey Boy Smith, the British Bulldog.  What happened to him?  He had a heart problem.  He made it to 39, though, so that's fairly common.  39?  I don't believe it.  Were there any allegations of steroid use in the Bulldog?  From time to time, that came up here and there.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Mr. Perfect, of course.  Mr. Perfect?  Mr. Perfect is dead?  Yeah.  That one I don't...  Mr. Perfect was great.  He'd come out and talk about how perfect he was.  Yeah, he left a perfect-looking corpse, too.  Oh, did he?  He did not age much.  How old was he?  He was 44.  Ah.  Cocaine, painkillers, and steroids.  Well, again, all three of those things, bad for the heart.  Probably, yeah.  Yeah.  The heart tends to give out.  Miss Elizabeth.  Miss Elizabeth.  Of course.  That was Randy Savage's brud.  Yes. 
[02:01:00]  She was in heaven before Randy got there, several years before him.  She did the old Heath Ledger cocktail of pills and alcohol and combinations that don't  work.  42.  So, Jesus.  Hawk of the Legion of Doom.  What a rush.  The Legion of Doom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a rush to die.  Yeah.  Apparently.  46, heart attack.  Wow.  Heart attack.  Again, was he kind of bulked up like he might have been doing?  He was always very large. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he, towards the end of his WWE run, was doing a gimmick where he had severe drug and  alcohol related problems, which many felt was in bad taste because it related too much  to what he was going through in real life.  Yeah.  They would make him come to the ring.  Did the man make money off his problems?  He did make money.  He would come to the ring acting drunk and staggering.  I do kind of remember that.  At one point in the middle of the match, he was on top of the big screen threatening  to jump because he was intoxicated. 
[02:02:00]  I remember that one.  In the storyline.  Wow.  Yes.  Wow.  These are all big names, by the way.  Yeah.  I didn't even know a lot of these guys.  Hercules.  Hercules.  He was another big, strong man.  Yeah.  A lot of muscles.  Mm-hmm.  But I guess he had heart disease.  Oh.  So they say.  At 47.  47.  Okay.  47.  Of course, the big boss man.  Yes.  The big boss man.  Wow.  That's crazy.  He had a heart attack.  At 41.  At 41.  41. 
[02:02:30]  41.  Again, you think the boss man was doing any steroids or anything?  I don't know if he was doing steroids because he was never like a super muscular guy.  No, no.  He was a big guy.  I'm sure that he indulged in other things.  Yeah.  Some type of drug related problem.  The earthquake.  Yeah.  He died at 42, but that was cancer.  Oh.  So.  Wow.  That was cancer.  Now that might have come about because of steroid use.  I don't know that.  I'm not a doctor. 
[02:03:00]  Bladder cancer.  Bladder cancer.  That's what we have here.  We'll just walk down the hall.  You'll see it.  Eating away at anything good.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Looking not unlike Jughead.  Jughead.  Wow.  The list goes on.  Yeah.  Sensational Sherry, who was also the Macho King's manager.  Who is that bitch?  The Macho King.  Yeah.  When he was a bad guy, he had... 
[02:03:30]  She's already dead, too.  Right.  Yeah, of course.  He is.  That was 49.  Wow.  Dry amounts of...  Still going?  Yeah.  All right.  Because Crush.  Crush.  At the time, he was Demolition Crush.  He would later go on to be a single superstar.  I remember, yeah, Demolition.  Wow.  Unconfirmed, 44.  Uh-huh.  What does Unconfirmed mean?  He probably had some heart problems.  Oh, they just don't know what got him?  Well, drugs are believed to have played a part, I'm reading.  Could have been.  Okay. 
[02:04:00]  Could have been.  And, of course, the Macho Man Randy Savage.  Macho Man Randy Savage.  But, I mean, you could add Gorilla Monsoon to this list, because he was doing play-by-play.  He was doing the, yeah.  So, 25% of the guys that performed for WrestleMania 7 are dead.  At WrestleMania 7, yeah.  Guys and gals.  If you watch WrestleMania 7, odds are there'll be a dead guy in one of the matches.  And 95% of the careers are completely dead.  Yep.  I mean, The Undertaker is still kicking.  That's about it.  Beyond that. 
[02:04:30]  Hogan is in TNA.  How many days did we go without a wrestler dying?  Did you guys talk about this?  Yeah, it was 38.  Yeah.  38 would make it take this time.  Sweet and sour Larry Sweeney was 38 days before the Macho Man.  Sweet and sour.  We haven't gone 100 days.  How long have we been doing this bit?  It's probably two years.  We're up to about two years where we're keeping track.  Every time a wrestler dies and we just want to go 100 days and we haven't done it in two years.  Correct.  What's the longest?  I think we made it around 80.  Oh, okay. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  We made it close, but never to 100.  We're going to make it this time around, I think.  You think the Macho Man is going to sober everybody up and kind of...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, take care of yourself.  Opening scene of Hangover 2.  They're in Zach's bedroom because they have to get him for the big trip to go to Thailand.  Yeah.  And there's a shitload of wrestling figures.  What are they called?  Toys.  Action figures.  Action figures.  Wrestling toys.  Dolls.  Dolls.  You can call them figures.  Wrestling dolls.  You can call them wrestling figures.  That's what I call them.  He's a fan of the wrestling, right? 
[02:05:30]  And then in his room there's a big picture of Randy Savage.  Randy Savage.  I thought that was a little strange.  Classic Macho Man Randy Savage poster.  Right in the middle of the opening scene.  It was an emotional scene for some of us in the theater.  Yeah, bittersweet right there.  Yeah.  Well, actually, no sweet.  It's just bitter.  Who was the oldest on that list?  Macho Man, 58.  58.  And then behind that was Hercules at 40.  Oh, no.  Sensational Sherry at 49.  Okay.  Everybody under 50 except for Macho Man.  Wow.  That's unbelievable.  British Bulldog was 39. 
[02:06:00]  He almost made it to 40.  I told you guys, that 40 to 50 range is not a good time to be a wrestler.  That's a rough time for wrestlers, man.  Wow.  All right.  Yikesy.  Just through the laws of averages.  We're going to break.  And coming up, Brian Johnson of ACDC.  Yeah, we should have a good break in case they back-to-back real quick.  We'll figure it out.  We might not have time to break in between them.  I could give a shit.  I'm a bit panicky.  Just put the fucking commercials in this shit hour. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  That is true.  I mean, we call it after.  Load them into the shit hour.  What is it called?  After Open Anthem.  That's not what it's called.  Oh, oh.  I thought it actually, they changed it to the shit hour now.  It wasn't changed.  Like legitimately.  No.  I went through management and they said go with it.  I mean, it's still on the website.  Now we know you're lying.  The shit hour.  And you really like Tang Over 2 more than me, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  More than, yeah.  And then the guy sitting next to you, Stanley T, from the morning mashup, was laughing like a  loan attack.  For the record, I was Stanley T's date.  I was there with Stan.  Nice.  Oh.  Good for you.  I want that to be clear. 
[02:07:00]  I didn't like it that much.  No?  I know, because you were making comments throughout the entire movie.  Did I not say, uh, Paul Giamatti, when they, Paul Giamatti appeared, I go, he's going  to save the movie?  Yeah.  I mean, I can understand.  Paul Giamatti to save the movie?  I can understand why your wife would elbow you.  It was like, it was pretty loud.  Somebody who didn't know you would consider that to be obnoxious behavior.  Sorry, I was just looking at Elvis Costello on TV.  Oh, Rachel Maddow.  I'm sorry.  Maddow.  Yeesh.  Yeesh.  I know.  That is gruesome.  And that's her dollied up to look like a female. 
[02:07:30]  Gosh, she's so horrendous.  If you see the pictures of her before she joined MSNBC, you would think it's a boy.  Yeah.  But they said, we can't have a boy doing, you know, this show, so we've got to make  you look like a female.  Please.  Obama's in England?  Is he?  Yeah, we'll talk about it.  London.  Can we finally talk about Obama?  Yes.  Before Brian Johnson gets here?  And the royalty.  Yes.  I want to say hello to all my intelligent radio station fans, Opie and Anthony.  And I want to say thanks to the Jesus or Muhammad or Allah to have come to the most famous city 
[02:08:00]  in the world.  Like Fred Sinatra said, the city never sleeps.  The city is up all the time.  Manhattan, Madison Square Garden, New York, and especially Opie and Anthony, radio station.  I love all my wrestling fans, and I love all radio station people wrestling, Anthony and 
[02:08:30]  Opie, Opie in show.  Number one in the world, from A to the C. If you cannot make it New York, you don't  make it nowhere.  Like Fred Sinatra said, the city never sleeps.  You cannot make it New York, you don't make it nowhere.  God bless Fred Sinatra, my Italian fazan.  He used to come watch my match in the garden, and he was the real, real singer and hot class  and part mafia. 
[02:09:00]  God bless you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  I like that Titty Mountain Highway thing that Robert Kelly did.  Yeah.  It's fucking catchy as all hell, isn't it?  I really thought that was an ACDC song.  Oh, really?  I was kind of half listening, yeah.  I don't know what it means.  Titty Mountain Highway!  Where's the Titty Mountain Highway?  Who cares, man?  I don't know where the Titty Mountain Highway is.  I punched it into my nav, and it didn't send me there.  Ryan's not here yet.  No, he's not. 
[02:09:30]  But he's early.  You're panicking.  He'll be here.  I'm actually not.  I'm just setting his mic up in case he comes.  You're panicking.  He wants to talk.  Your camera's set up nice on CDs.  I'm ready to go.  You got to do a test shot during the commercial break.  This is all-encompassing today.  What is Brian Johnson going to sign for you?  All I have, I want to take a photo with him, and I have one copy of his book, which I had  an advanced copy.  It's an uncorrected proof, which I'll get, because it's a little different, and then  just one ACDC CD if he'll sign it. 
[02:10:00]  Are you ever done with a celebrity?  Let me explain.  When this first started, this obsession of yours, we all remember you had celebrities  sign index cards.  Did I?  No.  No way.  Really?  My business cards.  Business cards.  Sorry.  Yeah, I got Richard Pryor on my business card.  Which is great.  I got a bunch of, yeah, I got all of Metallica on my business card separately.  So if Richard Pryor was alive, you go, business card signed, picture taken, then the picture,  no, I'm just saying if he was alive.  I'm trying to play this out with a celebrity. 
[02:10:30]  Are you ever done with a celebrity?  Oh, yeah.  Once I get a picture signed with me and them, I mean, a picture is great.  I mean, a picture signed is even better, and it's like, I wouldn't ask Kareem to sign  anything else.  I got them to sign a ball.  I wouldn't ask Liddell to sign anything else.  Yeah.  If I get them to sign something and they're cool with it, I'd just like to have it, because  that's something you'll have, like a stupid glove I got with, like, a second Bernard Hopkins  signed a glove.  I'm 42.  Like, if I'm 65, I'll still have that displayed in my house long after radio.  I'll have that my whole life. 
[02:11:00]  And it's a cool, I like that shit in people's houses, like their history.  Like, oh, you met someone, I love, like, when older performers have that stuff.  And now it doesn't matter, but when people die and I look out, like, I'm so glad I got  that fucking phone.  Yeah.  Like, I'm so glad I got Sam Kinison to sign a napkin.  Like, you got a photo with him.  I didn't do photos back then.  Yeah, but I was wearing shitty jeans.  I wouldn't care if I was wearing a fucking...  Acid washed jeans.  A dress and blackface.  If I had a fucking picture with Kinison, I'd be happy.  With the Bill Cosby sweater, because it was happening at the time.  It's...  Oh, wow. 
[02:11:30]  It doesn't matter.  It's a picture.  Yeah, yeah.  It's horrible.  It's a picture with Kinison, man.  I guess.  But you see that, you're like, god damn, that's a cool moment to have captured.  My picture, though, is Clinton.  And I had my arm around him.  That is a great shot.  Who gets to put their arm around a president?  Absolutely.  Beat that, motherfucker.  That is a good one.  Beat that.  It's a great picture.  I will eventually beat it.  I don't know how.  No, you won't.  I'll either get two living presidents together, or I'll get...  See, you have to get Obama, but you have to have your arm around Obama just to equal  my picture. 
[02:12:00]  Or I'll get Pacino and De Niro together.  To me, it would be as good as that.  Would beat Mike Clinton?  A lot of people would say no, but to me it would, because that, to me, would be two  guys I love together.  You got a picture with Muhammad Ali?  I do not.  That would be a close one.  That's the one that I'm actually wanting to use my...  Because I think my manager's got some connection.  I know David knows him.  And I really want to get a picture with Ali.  He's the one boxer I really don't have that I want.  That I really... 
[02:12:30]  Because Foreman we got, Frazier.  We got a lot of them.  I was watching fucking old boxing clips.  I was watching Foreman and Frazier fight, and I'm like, wow, we got fucking photos of  those guys.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah, yeah.  We were watching Joe get beat up by George Foreman.  Yeah, he took a thrashing.  Dude, six times he got knocked down.  He got beaten up.  Yeah.  It was an ass handed to him.  We got Hopkins coming in?  Bernard, yeah, I hope so.  He just won again.  I think he's coming in this week. 
[02:13:00]  We got Flavor Flav Friday.  Friday, but when is Hopkins in?  What day?  Roland didn't tell me.  I think he might be this week.  We're going to have Brian Johnson very, very soon.  Obama, Ant.  He's over there in England.  Yes.  Doing that crap.  Doing that bullshit.  What does it mean in the end?  I don't know.  It's like, they got to be like, we're allies.  We rule together and shit like that.  And they say things and the press covers it.  But he was in Ireland.  And then he went to England there and London. 
[02:13:30]  And then he hung out with the royal family, I guess.  The queen.  And...  Pippa?  I don't know.  Was Pippa there?  Was Pippa there?  No.  No Pippa.  No, Pippa was actually getting...  She goes for cum injections.  She gets them in her tuchus.  In her hiney.  That Pippa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although the Kate Middleton picture on the paper today, she's fucking really hot. 
[02:14:00]  Making Michelle Obama look silly.  Well, Michelle Obama is not attractive.  No, she's an older woman.  She's in her fucking like almost 50.  According to the paper...  What's what I'm saying?  According to the paper, guys, it says Battle Royal.  As striking as First Lady Michelle Obama appears at Buckingham Palace yesterday, it was Kate Middleton who got the lion's share of media attention.  Yeah, she's younger and a lot hotter.  Michelle Obama's not hot.  No.  For a First Lady, because a lot of them are so old.  Well, just because you're young doesn't mean you're hot and attractive. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  She's just all right.  But like Barbara Bush was...  She's a giant.  She's so much bigger than Obama.  Look at her.  Yeah.  You take the heels away and they're about the same height.  Yeah.  But she probably weighs more than her husband.  Kate Middleton's an attractive girl.  Yes, she is.  A boring-ass prince.  Oh, is he not giving her a good fuck?  No.  A sound thrashing.  He's not.  There was quite the faux pas on, I guess, the president's part. 
[02:15:00]  No, on the band's part.  On the band?  Yes!  They probably started playing exactly when they were supposed to.  No, they weren't.  He paused while he was talking and they started playing.  And they played right over him.  I haven't seen this yet.  It's so embarrassing.  Do you have the video clip there?  Yeah, it's so embarrassing.  Apparently Obama is doing a toast.  He's doing a toast.  Just put Obama, I think Obama, um, uh, Queen Toast. 
[02:15:30]  And that'll, that should come through.  Yeah.  It's, uh, oof.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah, he's, uh, he's, he's doing a toast, apparently, and the band starts up.  And, uh, no, that ain't it.  They mistook his pause as the end.  As the end.  Because they're dummies.  And instead of stopping, they fucking play right through.  And he says, like, to the, to the queen.  And, and, and the queen just kind of looks at him like, stop talking, black man.  And, and then turns her head away and listens to the dan, da, da, da, da, music. 
[02:16:00]  Can I, can I say something?  The queen should be the definition of cunt.  Think about it.  Yeah, yeah.  She is.  She is so cunty.  Yeah.  She's just a cold as ice, stiff woman.  Because we saw the royal wedding, and, and, in the end, it's her grandson getting married.  Yeah.  And she gave him nothing.  She's still.  Because she's supposed to be the big, you know, the big one that everyone's supposed to  The head muckety muck.  Pay attention to, even if your grandson's being married.  She's awful.  She didn't show one bit of personality through that entire thing. 
[02:16:30]  She stinks.  You don't touch the monarch.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shake hands, bitch.  Yeah, you don't touch her.  You don't, like, he looked like a douche.  And, look, I don't even, I sure don't, I'm no fan of.  She's not even looking at Obama.  She doesn't have to look at him.  I understand what she's, I guess.  That's ridiculous.  Fuck her.  And I don't like Obama.  Yeah, I know that, but he's your president, and that's fucking annoying.  And this is like a slap in the face of our country.  She's looking straight ahead.  Right.  As Obama's to her right, you know, trying to do something nice here, and she doesn't even 
[02:17:00]  want to look at him.  Look how awkward this is.  She's, well, not at home, but Jimmy hasn't seen this.  Let her rip.  Gentlemen, please stand with me and raise your glasses as I propose a toast.  She stands right.  To her majesty, the queen.  To the vitality of the special relationship between our peoples and, in the words of Shakespeare,  She looks alike. 
[02:17:30]  To this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this thing.  You don't talk over their national anthem.  And the queen just looks at him, and looks away, and now he puts his glass down, and now  he's just got to stand there.  He actually has to act like he meant to do that.  He was talking over their national anthem.  Too bad.  They should have started playing it.  Of course not.  And they're all just, look at them, they're all stuffed shirts.  Just down there.  Oh, they suck.  What's that? 
[02:18:00]  And now, and now they pick up their glasses.  To the queen.  Ugh.  To the queen.  Fuck that bitch.  How embarrassing.  That's actually not her fault, but the band should have just stopped.  Yeah, but do you see how she, like, she looked at him like, why are you still talking?  She could have stopped the band.  She could have put up her hand or something.  Why are you still talking?  Oh, you know what it is?  Maybe because when you say queen, they start playing.  Maybe they were told, when he says the word queen, start playing.  Oof.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know, but that was just, the band messed up, not Obama. 
[02:18:30]  Was he supposed to give a one-word toast?  So, to the queen.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  The fucking president of our country is talking, you faggots.  Why are they playing Joy to them?  Exactly, they're playing, for she's a jolly good fellow.  It worked, though, man.  For she's a jolly good cadaver.  For she's a jolly good cadaver.  And why can't you handle that with humor?  Why couldn't Obama, Obama felt like you couldn't do nothing, right?  No.  Why can't Obama go, you know, do something?  Cut the music. 
[02:19:00]  Something.  I would love him to say that.  Could you guys put a big pause on that?  He was talking over the Nestle anthem.  Oh, that's really uncomfortable.  If you can only imagine that happening here.  Like, the National Anthem starts playing, and everybody's like, all solemn, hands on heart,  and hats off, and everything.  And somebody just starts going, keep, you know, to continue talking.  And be like, well, what is this person doing?  Who's in the wrong there?  The band.  Absolutely.  The band was in the wrong, but Obama could have stopped talking instantly when the band  started out.  That would have looked even more awkward.  That looks worse, though, because he's literally got one line out. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  He didn't know.  No one told him the band's going to start playing.  He should stop at mid-sentence.  He should have thrown his drink in the Queen's face, and then smacked her.  Wouldn't you love him if he threw a drink in her face?  Oh, my God.  It would be great.  It would be international.  What would happen?  Let me talk to the real person in charge of this country.  What would happen?  I don't know, dude.  They would arrest him.  Oh, my God.  That would be great.  A big scuffle.  Obama would go, get your fucking hands off me, motherfucker.  Get your fucking hands off me. 
[02:20:00]  I hear most of the people over there really aren't into the Queen thing.  No.  And I hear that the royal family and him actually have a really good relationship, but they  like the Obamas.  For what reason?  What does she do?  Well, I mean, just the rest of them, too.  Prince Charles and...  That's funny.  He should have removed her hat.  Removed her crown.  Yes.  Wham-o.  Removed her tiara.  Kaplah.  Kaplah.  Jimmy's turning the TVs off.  No, no.  I'd love to have to be a dick.  No, no.  I know.  I know.  You're setting up for the big event.  I know.  But Jimmy's like...  Two big interviews today. 
[02:20:30]  Jimmy knows what's going on.  Yeah, look at that.  I'm looking at Kate Middleton.  Oh.  And that fucking Mrs. Obama.  Oof.  We got a guy in England.  Difference, that is.  We're going all the way to Manchester to talk to Andy.  Andy, what's up?  Across the Atlantic Sea.  Hey, how you doing?  Me allow.  What's up, Andy?  Yeah, not bad, not bad.  Just want to just sort of say it's pretty good having a bomb right over here.  Um, better than the last president.  Maybe he's more coherent. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Um, and, oh.  You know the miracle of technology that's making this phone call go through?  You're panicking, sir?  I'm sorry?  Are you panicking?  Uh, I am a bit, actually, yeah.  A little panicky, uh.  I was listening to Yanni's, uh, Yeastream feed a few weeks back.  Yeastream.  And that was pretty cool.  But, uh, I'll say, uh, I got a despicable CD.  That was cool as hell.  Thank you.  Um, really, really, really funny. 
[02:21:30]  Thank you, buddy.  Um, and yes, I am panicking.  Are you, are you from, uh, are you from the States originally, or?  Uh, no.  I'm originally from London.  Moved up to Manchester.  Wow, fuck.  That's so cool.  Oh.  Usually the people that listen to us in other countries are from here originally.  Yeah.  What did you think of Obama's, uh, that whole thing with the toast and the queen?  Was it, uh, whose fault was that?  I mean, they made a faux pas last time where, um, I think Obama's wife put his arm, her arm around. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, she did.  She fucking gave her a hug.  Good.  Just touch the bitch.  That, that kind of shows.  Just touch the bitch.  Humanity.  It's like, it's, there's too many people.  There's too many rules and restrictions, and it's, it's kind of cool to see that.  No, I agree.  Thanks for the call.  All right.  Take care.  Thanks for the call.  Uh, I think we're setting up.  Icon walking in.  Thanks for the call.  Is he coming down the hall?  Jim.  Hey.  All right.  Thank you, Andy.  I appreciate it.  We got Brian Johnson from ACDC coming in.  Uh, Sam?  He's on his way. 
[02:22:30]  He's done on the other show.  So.  Howie.  Yeah.  Howard Stern.  What are you doing?  Uh, I assume.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You said Stern.  I wouldn't have known.  Yeah.  We thought David Stern had a fucking basketball show here.  So do you have a, uh, is your camera charged and stuff?  Oh yeah.  And look at this.  Extra tape.  Tape.  Uh, really fast.  Where are you at with Obama being over there with the, the tornadoes?  Is he supposed to run home?  Oh, he said he was going to visit, you know, when he gets back or something.  Is that okay though or no?  Nah.  He, should he be over here? 
[02:23:00]  It's pretty huge, but I don't know what the president could do.  You know, I could, what the hell is that?  I could bash him and shit, but, you know.  Keep the door open.  Yeah, yeah.  Where's, where's Brian Johnson?  He's coming right now.  This way?  I'm laughing.  Okay, I don't want to fuck with that.  Here comes, I see Roland.  All right, here's Brian Johnson.  I was going to do something else.  I see Roland.  He's right here.  I see a girl.  Oh.  I see.  Yeah.  Thanks.  There's a girl.  You have to hit record, too.  Oh, Jimmy's camera is being turned on.  Look at that. 
[02:23:30]  That's him right there.  That's the guy.  Bring him right in.  Make sure he doesn't move too far to the right or you're going to lose your, he's fine.  And you move, move over.  No, just wait a little.  Okay, that's good.  Here we go.  All right.  Now, come right in.  We don't care about noise.  Oh, Brian Johnson live in studio.  What's up, Brian?  Hello, sir.  And you're all right.  Oh, great.  Much better now.  I don't talk in this accent normally.  No.  I talk like this regularly.  Of course you do.  How are you doing?  Sit down, buddy.  Hey, what's up, Brian Opie? 
[02:24:00]  Nice to meet you finally.  Man.  A fucking rock legend right here.  No.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  No, no matter what you say, you are, sir.  Oh, well, thank you very much.  Absolutely.  Yeah, amazing.  You're doing one this morning.  No?  Well, I met a couple of the old boys last night.  Oh, yeah.  Tip a few back, did you?  We did.  We knocked a few sherbets back in.  It was just lots of fun.  Yeah, we're just telling lies and, you know, stuff that guys do.  Yeah.  Do you ever get sick of the rock star life?  Do you ever get, like, bored with it? 
[02:24:30]  Well, not really because I don't do it, you know.  I just, I usually, you know, at home, I, you know, I go racing, you know, with a team  and you're just one of the guys when you go racing, you know, and I just enjoy the, you  know, being, you know, the excitement of the racing and all that and then every now  and again I've got to come out and do stuff like this and it just takes us all by surprise.  Yeah.  You know, and when people are going, hey, man, sign this, man, hey, man, you 
[02:25:00]  you, you, and I'm sitting, I'm going, yeah, that's, I get quite embarrassed by the whole  thing.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just, because I'm just.  You're just a regular guy, right?  You forget you're the lead singer of ACDC.  No, it's not, it's just, all the boys are the same in this band.  Yeah.  It's, it's the celebrity we kind of stand.  You know, you know, it's lovely for people to enjoy your music and think that you're,  you're the best at what you do.  Sure.  That's fantastic.  That's what you aim for in life.  But what you're never prepared for is the, the kids outside the hotel and you're going, 
[02:25:30]  oh, shit, I can't, I can't go out for a burger.  But you know, we're getting followed by, I mean, and it's all great, but it, it, it  becomes, you know, it becomes, well, at my age, I just don't, you know.  But we were watching, we were watching some clips from, uh, live from a river plate.  And when you look at the crowd, it is astounding.  Yes.  Uh, the amount of people and it looks like liquid.  They are just, uh, undulating.  I was seasick.  Yeah, right? 
[02:26:00]  I don't doubt it.  But when you, when you see that from the stage, you have to know like, holy shit, I guess we're,  you know, we're pretty damn popular.  So you're going to be signing some shit when you go out.  Yeah, I tell you that was, uh, you know, the audiences around the world for us have  been just totally spectacular.  And, you know, and I know every act turns on and says, yeah, I want to thank my fans  are the best in the world.  Well, that's a generic answer.  These guys, our, the ACDC fans, the things that do to get there, if you look at the outtakes, 
[02:26:30]  some of these 1200 kilometers with his son hitching and when that's not just with  them, they really are the most fascinating fans in the world.  The, the, the, the, I, I kind of believe them.  You'll see them, the same guys in Japan and you go, what the hell are you doing here?  I took two weeks off from work and my grandmother lent us the money.  You know, it's, you know, what's unique about it?  If you look at a lot of bands that have been around, uh, as long as you guys have been around,  uh, you'll notice their audience has gotten older, less energetic. 
[02:27:00]  Sometimes you go to a show and see a band that's been around for a while and it's like,  oh, great.  You know, fucking grandma's out in the audience.  Your audience is moshing.  They're fucking going insane.  No, I got to jump in with that thought because they're making new fans.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  A lot of bands, their fan base stops.  Yep.  And the crowd gets old with the band.  But something with ACDC, there's still very young fans.  We are fascinated looking at the audience.  We see three generations. 
[02:27:30]  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think one of the things is because we'll keep bringing out new albums.  A lot of these older bands don't.  Yep.  Don't bring out any more new albums, you know, and they're not great bands.  But I think if you bring out fresh material all the time, it gives them something to say,  well, I bought this, you know, I got this.  I didn't get it off me dad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This isn't me dad's music.  This is my music.  And it's a fascinating thing.  And boy, oh boy, we appreciate it because we have so much fun, you know,  seeing these little five-year-olds.  We're, you know, jumping off and down. 
[02:28:00]  And checking out the titties next door on that band.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, only five kids.  Leave it.  It's too expensive.  Giving you a very lucrative good life too, which is nice, right?  Yeah.  You can kind of do what you want to do in life and never have to worry again.  Well, we can it.  And it's, you know, it's, well, that's the very lucky bit.  You know, you can do what you want.  And my indulgence is just motor cars.  Yeah, you love the cars, man.  You are a car guy.  I just, just since I was a kid, though, you know. 
[02:28:30]  But now I'm lucky enough to get a chance to race cars, which is, it's an expensive hobby.  I realize that.  And, but that's all I do.  I mean, you can never see me on the edge of, on the end of a fishing pole.  Yeah.  I don't have a boat.  I don't play golf.  Well, not really.  Do the other guys in the band, like, go like, hey, motherfucker, get out of these fucking race cars.  Yeah.  You know, get a little nervous.  There was a little worry, but they know that I'm, I'm competent, you know. 
[02:29:00]  I'm not going to, I'm not going to be, have a couple of little scrapes now and again.  Well, Jimmy gets mad at me, because I, I like cars, love them.  Yeah.  I like driving fast.  Yeah.  Hold on, let me see, are you also an alcoholic?  Because we have to tie in all the fucking facts.  I don't drive drunk.  As a matter of fact, please, please, come on now.  Oh, boy.  Show my, Anthony has a suit of Saturn.  Oh, this is my, I got a GT500, a Super Snake, Shelby. 
[02:29:30]  Uh, and this was at, uh, Pocono Raceway, uh, the other, the other day.  This was just, this past weekend.  I come her off turn three, down the stretch, you could hear the supercharger kicking in.  And, uh, this, this is a lot of fun, man.  Yeah.  But Jimmy doesn't like when I do this.  That's fun.  Right?  That's another car starting up.  Uh, but that's a lot of fun, right? 
[02:30:00]  I've never, I've never been to Pocono.  Pocono's great.  It's a long straightaway.  Yeah.  Watkins Glen.  Kind of a tri-oval.  I've done Watkins Glen up in New York, and that's one of my favorites.  Yeah, yeah.  What a supercharger.  So you're a, you like, uh, road courses, right?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  He wasn't impressed by the video.  Oh, that's okay.  Well, he probably wasn't impressed.  He couldn't hear anything.  He couldn't hear it.  He didn't have his headphones on.  Okay.  He didn't have the headphones on.  And a car, and a car was going in a straight lane, you see.  Yeah, see?  You like to turn.  He likes.  He likes to turn.  He likes a man's race. 
[02:30:30]  That was pussy racing.  Go ahead, Sam.  It's okay.  It was pussy racing.  You're probably being polite there.  Well, your granny can drive in a straight lane.  I'm sure you're not.  See, that's why I had to stop this.  Of course you can.  Your granny can drive in a straight line.  Exactly.  Because you were hoping for a big reaction, and you didn't really get much there.  No, no.  I came out of turn three, though.  I was making turns.  Yeah.  I turned one, turned two, turned three.  That was a straight one.  That was straight.  That was cute, though, right?  He went by and vroom.  Vroom, vroom.  See, Brian likes turning.  Yeah, you've got to see them in the corners and all that. 
[02:31:00]  That's a 500 GT, you said?  Yeah, yeah, GT 500.  It's been super snake and worked.  I had a kid put into it.  So it's about 800 horsepower.  Yeah, it's got a lot of torques in that car, and you've really got to treat them gently.  I just got a Lola T-70 Mark I, which is a 1965 Can-Am car.  And that's like, you know, when you drive that, it's like fucking an alligator with a headache.  That can come out from under you real easy.  That really can, man.  I don't get enough. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, can I say something about this book?  I have no interest in cars.  So when I first saw this book, I drive them.  You're a fruit.  No, but I don't care about cars.  It's going to turn into a compliment.  No, no, it's not a bad thing.  It's like I looked at it, I'm like, ah, it's a book about cars, all right.  Jimmy's a poof-ter.  I started, I opened the book, and the fucking first thing is about when he's a kid, and  you talk about how the first time you jerked off was like in an army truck, and I was fucking  hooked.  This book is fucking hilarious.  This book is fucking, it's so good, man.  I blew through 100 pages the first day. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, thanks.  Well, it wasn't supposed to be anything else, but just a bit of fun.  But it's not just about cars, though.  It's about your life with cars.  Oh, absolutely.  It's really great, man.  But it's just, you know, we're doing a Black Ace album, there was nothing to do the first  few years for the singer, because the musicians are in, getting the sound, with the producer,  you know, they're getting cool, and so one of my friends said, you know, Brian, you tell  grit after dinner stories, why don't you write them down, and I said, well, I can't remember  anything of my memories, except when I think of cars. 
[02:32:30]  You know, like, I think of a car, when I had the Hillman Hunter, oh, jeez, and I could  remember going out in it, going and seeing the lads, which pub it was, and it was the  strangest feeling.  Holy shit.  So I just thought writing about cars, which brought the memories back to us, and with other  boys in the band, and, you know, different things, it's like, you know, Phil, when he's  a car fanatic, and when he had his first Ferrari, and, you know, he's as mad as a March  hair, Phil, when he's driving, as I say in the book, when he's driving, he treats the 
[02:33:00]  other road users as his entertainment.  Wait, is he the one that nobody wants to drive with?  Absolutely.  The fucking...  He's terrifying.  The lines...  He's terrifying.  I wrote the line down.  It was fucking made me so happy.  He said, people avoid...  Make excuses to avoid getting in the car.  Like, yours was, sorry, I gotta stay home and rearrange my fridge magnets.  And fucking...  And Angus's was that he'd forgotten the rift to Highway to Heaven and had to practice  it.  This fucking book is really funny, man. 
[02:33:30]  Dags, man.  That's nice of it.  That's really good, man.  See, it's true, though.  You do remember things based on, like, the cars that you've had in your life.  Sure, I do.  So, it's a great way to put down, like, your memories of your past and growing up and  everything.  Well, you remember how much money you had, even.  Yeah.  You're sitting there going, oh, I remember, I was really broke.  Yeah, I couldn't put gas in the thing.  Yeah, I couldn't put gas in it, and, you know, and I was next door neighbor's car with a tube  because I didn't like them. 
[02:34:00]  Siphoning.  You know, enough to get us to work the next day.  Yeah.  But it was like that.  You know, times, how many guys have gone into gas stations and said, half a gallon, please.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what we had to do.  Half a gallon, please.  Yeah, give me a dollar's worth or something.  There's a funny part where you're crawling underneath the car with a hammer because your  starter motor's stuck.  You have to bang on the starter motor.  You had to do that.  You just broke.  You couldn't get a new starter.  You couldn't afford that.  Exhaust pipes, you know, with old cans and some wire.  Wire hanger. 
[02:34:30]  Just anything.  Just anything to keep that bugger on the road.  Just keep it running.  But it's, everybody had to do it.  We weren't all born with a silver spoon in my mouth.  Yeah.  We didn't, you know, in America, I find it quite amazing when I see a 16-year-old girl  in a 500 bus Mustang with her iPhone things in.  And she's texting.  And you're going, geez, do you know what's under the hood of that motor car? 
[02:35:00]  And she's probably texting him, ironically enough.  And then you see them, you know, obituaries.  Carly Thompson, who was the bright light of such and such school, had an accident the  other day.  What happened?  Well, she, once again, with American cars, she tried to turn a corner.  Yeah.  Well, no, American cars aren't good at that.  You know, especially these big powered ones.  Unless you get a, you got a watch.  Unless you get it roused up.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you got an aftermarket. 
[02:35:30]  But yeah, you got to, you know.  You know, vipers, vipers wouldn't, you know, just, you had to be really careful in those  things.  I mean, I drove one at mid-Ohio, the racetrack, just to test it.  That thing just snapped out every which way.  The SN will come right out on you.  It was the worst.  And forget it.  But it looked fabulous.  I mean, it just looks great.  It looked like it was going fast.  On a humid day, there's too much moisture on the road.  You just slide out.  God forbid it starts raining when you're driving one of those things.  You got to just, yeah.  Oh, a great chapter, too, is when you start attacking people who pimp their cars. 
[02:36:00]  I fucking love that you take those stupid rappers and their dumb gold teeth.  Oh, he gave a fucking beating.  It was great.  It was nice to read.  Well, thank you very much.  And I stand by that.  Yeah.  Like they're going to outthink the people at Mercedes or some other car.  Yeah, I mean, it's just mindless.  Do you need TVs?  Mindless violence is what it is.  Do you need TVs in the doors?  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  You know, what, four feet?  You have a four-foot base?  Yeah.  Speaker? 
[02:36:30]  I said, da.  Yeah, just, nothing's more annoying than that.  Basically, all it is is, look at me, look at me.  Yeah.  Hey, everybody, look at me.  Yeah.  Come on.  I mean, you in a corner.  Look at me.  And I just, the coolest dude, and now you're a nut.  How often do you race a year?  Usually about, I try to get to about 10 race meets a year, you know, from the west coast  to here to Silverstone and London and Donington, Monte Carlo. 
[02:37:00]  And what kind of racing do you do?  What do you do?  Well, this is called vintage racing, which really isn't vintage, but it's, you know, anything  over five years old now is vintage because you can't race it professionally anymore because  it's just not quick enough.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, you do drive some very fast cars out there and very modern and I just love it.  It's competitive.  It keeps your edge.  You know, you have to keep fit to do it because of the G-forces pulling your left and right 
[02:37:30]  and, um, and, uh, it's, it's just a competition, you know, that, that I like and I like to  win as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how it was good.  How often, how, yeah.  How often do you win?  Uh, I've, uh, last year, well, I was just, after I finished there, I had about, uh, three  wins last year.  Nice.  I think two seconds.  What was it?  Two wins and three seconds.  But anyway, it was, uh, it was good.  I like to win and I like to come in the top 10 if I don't win and I've had a good race.  Makes no difference to me as long as I've had a good race. 
[02:38:00]  How about the other drivers?  Are they, uh, like, Hey, uh, I love, love the band.  Uh, yeah.  Could you sign this?  Yeah.  As I say, I started, I didn't want to come floating in there with the big rig and the  big car.  Right.  Right.  Big team.  I wanted to earn the respect of the other guys by starting with a small car and, you  know, learning me tread and getting up on through the, uh, different classes until I  reached the, the top one.  Yeah.  That's a good way to do it.  If you came in looking all like a pro, uh, you know, that's not a cool way to do it. 
[02:38:30]  So that's what we're doing.  And, uh, and now they're just great friends and, uh, and I love to be the track with these  guys.  It's, uh, it's, it's the camaraderie's great.  It's not like professional racing where everybody's sniping and fighting.  You know, people loan people parts, you know, they're going to shit me.  Wow.  They'd never do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My suspension arm's gone.  Yeah.  I've got one.  Do you want to borrow it?  Well, that's cool.  Back at the end of the race.  Right.  Right.  Fantastic.  It's called HSR.  The, the, the, the racing, it's historic and historic sports car racing.  And it's, uh, it's entertaining. 
[02:39:00]  We get the crowds in to see it because you see things like 66 vets, about 10 of them  coming around the corner and listening to that noise because now race cars don't have  any noise.  It's like, hmm.  Yeah.  Like that fucking car.  Like his fucking girly machine that he fucking, yes.  Yeah.  Well, he had a, he had a big wreck with this car too.  That was a big wreck.  Let's tell Brian about your big wreck.  That is true.  Talk about taking corners.  Yeah.  He took a corner, Brian. 
[02:39:30]  Shut up.  Why don't you share with Brian Johnson your experience?  Two racers.  The tires were a little cold.  It was very cold out.  The road had sand on it because they had sanded because it was snowing.  Sure.  And the SN came out a little bit and I might've kissed the guardrail.  You didn't listen to your crew, did you?  You got to listen to the crew and again, Brian, I was on my way to the bank.  He was going to the bank in his Long Island.  Ask him how fast he was going, Brian Johnson.  I wasn't going fast.  I was just, I was just, I was just shifting.  Come on.  I was probably doing like 25 miles an hour. 
[02:40:00]  25?  Nothing.  I was on the service road or the expressway.  You won't get hurt if you run that fast into something.  I know.  That's why they're making it sound like it.  I blew a sneak out once running at 25 miles an hour.  Jesus Christ.  That's not quick.  You guys are making me out to be asshole.  You're relating a little too much with Brian Johnson.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm just trying it a little bit.  Next time we're up at Watkins Glen, me son, I'm going to get in touch with you and you've  got to come up and see and we'll try to get you in one of the team cars.  Oh, that would be nice. 
[02:40:30]  And we've got a couple of two-seaters there and I'll take you around first of all.  We'll take you in, show you the lane and then get in with you and we'll let you try  a couple of laps with Watkins Glen.  Take a couple of laps?  I would love that.  Watkins Glen, man.  Yeah, it's a scary one.  Yeah.  But it's fun.  Sounds it.  Man, you really, I didn't know you were this much into racing.  Oh, yes.  Do you own these cars?  Do you own a lot of, there's photos in the middle of the book of a bunch of beautiful  cars.  You own all of them?  No, I don't know all of them.  That's just car pornography to me. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's just car pornography.  I love it.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  I certainly do.  Have you had to do anything over the years for your voice?  Because obviously ACDC is known, you know, you are known for having that voice and it  seems like a very tough voice to maintain.  No, I don't do a bloody thing.  That's great.  I know that, you know, I've been to see other bands backstage and I'll hear the singer and 
[02:41:30]  he'll be up in some room going, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Now listen, what the fuck?  What's he doing?  You can curse.  You got a flu?  You can curse.  You got a flu or something?  He's like, no, no, that's John warming up, you know.  Playing from special speech therapist, you know.  That was different.  And then, and I got in and then, and before we go on, I remember.  I still do it and the guys will be getting ready and I, and I just walk into the shower  and go, eee, right, I'm ready. 
[02:42:00]  That's it.  That's all you do.  That's all I do is if I can hit that note or that clarity.  You're right.  That's, me voice is good.  Ah, jeez, I hope I didn't definitely, but.  No, that's great.  We want you to do more of that.  Basically, that's all you do and that's all I need to do because then I know it's there.  And, uh, and on we go, you know, it just balls out.  And then you have a little crackling, you know, like, uh, it might be a tough night. 
[02:42:30]  Uh-uh.  Have you had those nights where it's like, oh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.  Well, you know, if you've done a lot of gigs in a row and, you know, it's, and you're tired,  you know, you, you, you, you just got to pull out that extra 10%.  Right, right.  You've just got to get over it and, uh, get it on.  But, but you do it.  Hmm.  You know, you do it because it's ACDC and ACDC go 100%, if not more.  And if you don't do it, you just look like a wimp.  Yeah.  You know, you're left behind.  You know, it's like, uh, in the snow, you know, you, so you, you, you just go with the 
[02:43:00]  boys and it's, and it's easier, really, you know, that you, they just pull you along  with them.  It's just got this energy on stage that I can't ever describe what it is, but it's  like, uh, I said the other day to somebody, he said, we talked about the voice and, uh,  just said, well, even when, when I'm not with ACDC and I've done a couple of charity gigs  with other, you know, great musicians, my voice never sounds the same.  I mean, it's all right.  And it's up there.  But once I get together with the boys again, something in our sale, rehearsing for an album 
[02:43:30]  or something, and they start playing, this, this thing comes out that didn't belong to  me, but I'll use it while it's there.  You know what I mean?  Wow.  That's something.  Yeah, it is.  It's just a strange thing.  The, the, the, the, the, the way these guys play and the energy that even when they're  just sitting down and rehearsing, it's quite, quite phenomenal.  So it's, that's right in your comfort zone.  Yeah, it is.  I love it.  Yeah.  You feel comfortable.  When you, when, uh, when, after Bond, Bond died, um, and you, you replace a guy who's, you  know, pretty legendary and love singer. 
[02:44:00]  Is there a feeling when you go into a band, like, I'm not going to be able to live up  to this or, or the, the fans are never going to, like, when did you realize the fans were  going to accept you as the lead singer?  Yeah.  Well, you know, obviously the, the first time I went out, uh, you know, I was obviously  worried because he was a very loved man and he, and quite rightly so, he was a genius,  the kid.  And, uh, it was the boys that were, uh, great.  They'd just come up and just said, now listen, John, that's my first gig.  We're playing in Belgium.  And he says, well, first gig, we're just going to do a, it's a small one. 
[02:44:30]  There's only 2,000 kids here.  So we'll let you get bedded in, you know, and I was going, okay, then, uh, and then  I came back and I said, by the way, there's an extra 2,000 kids here.  We're going to, it was one of them exposition centers.  And I just moved the walls and it was fun.  In the end, it was 10,000.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  And I was sitting there and of course there was delays and I'm going, and I, and I, and  I was getting a bit nervous and on we went and I went out and of course it was the first  time the boys were placing Bon's death and the placards for Bon. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, wow.  Just everywhere.  But right in the middle, uh, there was one big one from the fan club.  Just said, good luck, Brian.  Oh, wow.  It was all it took.  Wow.  So.  Was Back in Black out at this point or is it before you have?  It had just come out.  And so when we sang Back in Black, the first reaction to it was like.  I didn't know what it was.  Just very polite.  The first two songs we did, I'll never forget as long as I live, we did, uh, we did Bad 
[02:45:30]  Boy Boogie and Hell in a Bad Place to Be, one after the other, and I sang the words to  Bad Boy Boogie in both songs.  I was so nervous.  Oh, shit.  That's a whole start.  I was like, this is not right, this is not right, but your brain was full.  I was going, this is, because we didn't have machines then, but the words, it was just,  I just, pan, this all, I'd learned all these words.  And, and, and, and, and, and just, the, the, the, the occasion was just so big, you know. 
[02:46:00]  What, what did the guys do?  They just laughed.  And they just kept, they just played on.  But what did they, they, they, yeah, I know they're that type of band, but what did they  say to you afterwards?  Did they just bust your balls?  They didn't bust your balls?  No, they didn't bust me balls at all.  They just said, nice one, Jonah.  Because they knew what I was going through.  Yeah, I bet, yeah.  But it was, uh, they call you John, it's, it's J-O-N-N-A, because that's in the book  a lot.  Is that in, is that a, for, for Johnson?  For Johnson, that's it.  I just figured out, as I was asking him why they call him that, and then I realized  what an asshole question that was. 
[02:46:30]  Jonah, for Johnson, I, it's, uh, everybody gets called.  If you're called Gary, you're called Gaza.  You know, that's just what, just what they do in England, you know, that's, that's it.  So, uh, let me, this is a kind of an off-the-subject question.  But it's the second question, I, a third, a fourth question I wrote.  What, what is the best car you've gotten a blowjob in?  He writes it down.  I did write that down.  Like that, yes.  Because he taught, Brian, he's open, he talked about, like, fucking banging chicks and their  feet hanging out of the fucking, it's really, this is. 
[02:47:00]  Um, oh, jeez, I can't remember, I know, and I've just told you that when it's mentioned  cars, I remember everything.  And, um, all right, just say Saturn.  Anything come to mind if we say Saturn?  There had to be a Jag.  Hmm.  I thought it'd be a Jaguar.  Well, I was driving.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  In front.  Those are, uh.  Really?  It's coming to them.  That's dangerous.  Yeah, no.  Yeah.  No.  But your legs get twitching sometimes.  He's gotten, these ones, he's been blown in so many great cars. 
[02:47:30]  That's the beauty of, of being a rock star.  It's like, well, how many great cars have I been blown in?  Like, for me, the list is very short.  Fucking, a Saturn and my BMW truck.  And that's about it.  I saw McCartney.  A Saturn.  Uh, I drove a Saturn for a long time.  The Nortons are Saturn people.  We, uh, we had Saturns.  And that we were just, you know, very, uh.  Thank God, they're extinct now, aren't they?  Are they?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I got a lot of fucking hookers in that car.  Jimmy got a lot of hookers in the Saturn.  A lot of prostitutes in the Saturn.  Did he?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, it's really, you'd be surprised because it's not a great car, so you don't care.  Well, it's nice to know you're shared in your wealth.  Yeah.  A few, a few daddies, too, Brian.  No, no, no, no.  A few daddies.  No, no, no.  I don't know.  I'm trying to tell Brian about trannies.  Come on.  He doesn't want to hear about that, do you?  No.  No, me neither.  No.  Stop.  No.  Yeah.  We all make mistakes.  You know how it is?  Curtains.  Screens, nose, quickly.  Hey, uh, where's the band at these days?  What, uh, what's the schedule?  We met up a couple of weeks ago in London and, uh, you know, for the premiere of the, uh, 
[02:48:30]  the River Plate thing, we had a big premiere.  That was lots of fun.  And, uh, we've just sat and we're having a talk about what, what we're going to do and  all of this.  And, uh, and it was, it was fun to be with the lads again, you know, after a few months  and, uh, you know, and we decided on absolutely nothing.  Like, we usually, we just sit there and have a good talk, but never decide on anything.  Do you guys get it?  But knowing that, that, that talk is the step. 
[02:49:00]  Right.  Do you get itching to get back out there?  Yeah.  Do you start getting the itch?  Sometimes, um, the only thing you, you, you don't want to do is, oh, that traveling again.  Take that, the bit on the stage, that's a doddle, that's brilliant, that's two hours of hard  work, but fantastic reward, you know.  And then the other 22 hours is just a pain in the ass.  You know, um, it's just, you, you, every day, you know, of the gig, you know, rice and  chicken at two o'clock to get us through till nine o'clock. 
[02:49:30]  Water all day long, bottles and bottles of water.  And, um, and then, uh, and then on the stage.  And that's great.  And then the next day, exactly the same.  I mean, I get on a plane, fly somewhere, get there, and it just goes there.  And that's the thing that kills you is the travel.  So, and that sounds glamorous to some people.  But it's, it's just a grind, huh?  Oh, it is just a grind.  But thankfully, it's the, it's the bit on the stage that makes it all worthwhile, you  know.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the fun bit.  Yeah, why would you go through all the other crap if it wasn't so much fun, right? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Do you have any, uh, there's a line in the book too where you say, it's, it's almost as  something as, like, Gene Simmons' next career move.  Do you and Gene not get along or do you like him or do you kind of, are you not too crazy  for him?  Uh, I don't, I don't, uh, I don't know the lad.  I don't know the boy.  Me do.  He seems a bit of a jackass.  Well, two out of three of us think.  I just read the line in the book, so I was wondering if you guys ever had any or if you  just think he's...  Well, no, it's just the lad does a lot of different things.  Oh, okay. 
[02:50:30]  And, uh, that's why I said it's, uh...  Not fond of all of them, though.  Uh, yeah, well, that's the way I said what I said.  It's funny.  It's funny.  Because it's funny, damn it.  Oh, by the way, I learned that, uh, Chuck Berry was a cunt.  I never knew that.  That was the most important lesson I learned in the book.  You did, these guys, what, you guys opened for him or something?  Or you did a gig with him?  Yeah, I was in a band called Geordie and, uh, Chuck Berry's my hero.  You know, he was just greatest, one of the greatest rock and roll writers and singers  in the world. 
[02:51:00]  And, uh, he, uh, he, we went in Germany on a tour with my little band Geordie and he used  all our equipment for a week.  Like, free, we'll let him have it, because we were such awe, you know, and, uh, and at  the end of the week, he was sitting in his car, and I said, uh, could I have an autograph,  mister?  Oh, really?  Yeah, and he went, I don't want an autograph a day, and I've already signed it.  I went, well, it's made by, I was singing in the other band, he'd been using our equipment,  and he went, I don't care. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, man, what a prick.  I'm a mean twat.  And, uh, so it was, uh, it was just one of them things.  You know, it's like the old saying, never meet your heroes.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll always be disappointed.  But he was, he wasn't, he wasn't a nice, he wasn't the nicest man, I think.  A little bitter.  Yeah.  A little bitter.  I think he, I think he hated everybody.  Yeah, that seems to be what it is.  I didn't take it personal.  We, uh, we actually have to wrap up.  You've got to go to, uh, I guess, uh, Brewer, right?  Yeah, you know Brewer real well over there, too. 
[02:52:00]  Ah, there you go, Jimmy.  And then you got me again on the Boneyard.  I'm doing you again.  On the Boneyard?  Hoo-ah!  By the way, the book is called, I'm being very honest when I tell you, the book is hilarious.  And I said I have no interest in cars, because you don't have to have an interest in cars to like this.  It's like, the way, the way you tie it in is fucking, it's a truly funny book.  And it's interesting.  I'm pleased you like it.  I loved it.  I blew, I say this, I'm on page right now, not that you give a shit, I'm on page 122.  I fucking blew through a hundred pages.  Wow, you have to do it, too.  Yeah, so.  Reader.  Yeah, yeah, good, lads. 
[02:52:30]  Book signings, Jimmy.  Oh, where are the book signings?  Brian Johnson's going to be at the book review in Huntington tonight at 7pm, and then bookends  in Ridgewood, New Jersey tomorrow at 7pm.  I don't think we have to promote that.  Very cool, Brian Johnson.  Thank you, Brian.  Thanks so much, man.  Hey, lads, thank you very much.  It was a blast.  Can't wait to have you back, Brian.  This was great.  You can swear so professionally.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  I want to get a picture with Brian.  How are we going to do this with Malcolm McDowell coming in?  I'll take Malcolm for a second.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Brian's leaving, and Malcolm McDowell is entering the studio. 
[02:53:00]  Working his way in.  Yeah.  You want to say hi?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's right there.  Come on in.  Yeah, I'm coming in.  I can take a photo with you before you.  Malcolm!  My God, man!  Fucking hell!  My God, man, fucking hell!  I thought they, all right, they actually do know each other.  This is hilarious.  Come in.  That's hilarious.  This is the funniest man.  The funniest man in rock and roll. 
[02:53:30]  Do you tell him the Bible rules?  Wait, wait.  Do you tell him the Bible rules?  Do you want to grab him?  He is hilarious.  Wait, what do you want to?  I'm glad to see you, man.  He said, Malcolm McDowell, I said, get the fuck out of here.  Hey, man!  Malcolm McDowell, he did one of the songs that we're going to do for this musical,  which unfortunately never got finished.  We'll do it.  But you've got to hear this song that he wrote.  It's called, It's Good to Be Good.  No, you wrote it.  Yeah, I wrote it.  He said it.  Make yourself coffee, man.  It's still fantastic, that song.  So how have you been doing here? 
[02:54:00]  Have they been treating you well?  They've been treating us well.  Because you're royalty, man.  You know that.  You're royalty.  No, rah!  He's trying to come off as a humble guy.  Oh, bollocks.  Tell him about the vinyl roofs, man.  Tell him about that.  He said, this man is the funniest man I've ever met.  No, it's the vinyl roofs thing.  That's what I did, you see.  Oh, you put on vinyl roofs?  Yeah, refurbishing cars.  I used to refurbish cars because I didn't have any money after the first band.  So I had to go out and put windshields in. 
[02:54:30]  It was my own little company.  Oh, shit.  And, of course, I was making a can of your living.  Yeah.  And when ACDC came along and said, do you want to come for an audition?  And I said, nah, I've been bitten by the bug once.  I was in a band in Jordan.  No, but they said.  They wouldn't tell him who the band was.  Oh.  And he goes, well, I'm not coming down to London if I don't know who it is for.  Who am I supposed to be auditioning for?  And they went, we can't tell you.  And he goes, hey, you've got to tell me something.  And they went, well, we can give you the initials.  The initials. 
[02:55:00]  That's good.  The initials.  So a woman, she was called Olga from the vault.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she said, I cannot tell you this, but I can tell you the initials.  I said, well, what are they?  And she went, it's the AC on CDC.  And I said, you mean AC DC?  She went, I have said too much.  But he goes down there.  He goes down there for the audition.  I had to borrow somebody.  He goes, I've got eight fucking vinyl roofs tomorrow. 
[02:55:30]  Who gives a shit, right?  Yeah.  I'd give up the vinyl roof business.  So you guys obviously go way back.  He goes down there and starts playing snooker.  Because the guys are playing snooker and they've been waiting for him for hours.  And he's playing snooker with the lads.  With a crew guy.  And the guy goes, aren't you Brian Johnson?  And he goes, yeah, what?  He goes, they're waiting for you upstairs.  I was a bit poor with the boys.  Instead of auditioning for AC DC? 
[02:56:00]  Yes, sir.  Boy, they are.  You're really lucky to get this one.  You really shouldn't have gotten that gig?  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  It was fun.  It was fun, though.  It was a lot of fun.  What are you doing here?  I mean, son of you.  Promoting?  Yeah, promoting.  I'm just promoting.  Oh, come on.  Do a tell.  It's the 40th anniversary of Clockwork.  There's a big screening tonight at MoMA.  Is there?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Finally, we're getting treated with respect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be in Willow, Willow, fuck.  Oh, it was me.  You know what I mean? 
[02:56:30]  I'm going to be in Long Island.  Long Island.  Long Island.  Long Island, I'm sorry.  Are you, what are you doing?  Working or what?  Just signing the books and stuff.  Oh, you've got a book out, guys.  It's a funny book.  You're just reeking everything you can out of this.  He's hysterical, man.  Just murder calls.  Oh.  Oh, you cars.  Oh, man.  Oh, you cars.  Oh, by the way.  You can have my copy, Malcolm.  By the way, let me just tell you that when we arrived to do this recording, you know, to put  down this thing, which I had never done, really.  Yeah.  So, and he came, and he's being, they were doing a documentary about it, and he arrived  on his motorbike into this parking lot of this little studio in the valley, and he immediately 
[02:57:00]  falls off the damn thing.  Great.  Speed bump.  Didn't you?  I fell off.  It's all on film.  Oh, shit.  I fell off and I did a somersault and went, ta-da.  Yeah.  Nice entrance.  It's a good entrance.  It's a tall man.  It's all memorable.  Oh, look at that.  You're down.  Great.  But, I have a read of it.  The longest chapter, I think it's three and a half pages, that was a biggie. 
[02:57:30]  Look at you.  What's that?  That's me Royale RP4.  Is that Lola?  No, that's a Royale RP4.  Oh, really?  The Lola's not in there, because I hadn't bought it in this.  Ah, man.  Yeah, quite the car enthusiast.  How many years do you guys go back?  Well, no, we met at the British Grand Prix.  Yeah, at Silverstone.  Yeah.  And, I don't know, it's a few years now, isn't it?  I mean, 19...  Whatever.  Just a fan, Malcolm, or do you race?  I'm a fan of it.  Yeah.  Do you race at all?  Yeah?  No, he races.  Yeah.  I don't race. 
[02:58:00]  I don't race.  I just have a few nice classic cars.  I love surprises.  That was a hell of a surprise for everybody.  Hey, man.  I said that they're probably going to know each other.  I did say that.  I've got three boys now.  It is a small island.  Two, four, and seven.  Oh, shuddy.  Two, four, and seven, and they're amazing.  They're just absolutely wonderful.  Well, I've got a grandson now, me son.  Oh, Jesus.  Edwin.  Congratulations.  Edwin of Northumbria.  It is hard to see ACDC.  There's a grandfather up there.  I'm going off to see him on Monday.  I fly to London, and I'll go up to see him, and then I'm off to Italy. 
[02:58:30]  Are you touring again, or what?  No, not just yet.  We're just sort of talking, and humping, and scratching my testicles.  You know, oh, great, man.  That's great.  It is amazing.  I didn't know you were a grandfather.  He's got one of great voices, isn't he?  Oh, please, right?  He does a lot of...  And my wife goes up to him naively and says,  Oh, Brian, I just love, you know, All Night Long.  It's such a passionate song.  He goes,  What? 
[02:59:00]  No.  I have diarrhea down there.  That's why I'm up all night long.  She goes,  What?  That was the inspiration.  I had the worst diarrhea.  Because the first bit was about a car, you know?  Yeah.  Sorry.  I feel like a TV hood.  As we walk around here. 
[02:59:30]  Somehow it's odd having to show Brian Johnson mic technique.  It is funny.  I'm showing Brian the microphone.  It goes out by your mouth.  I usually put my mic down because I usually say something incriminating.  Before I...  Was that song really about you shitting?  Yeah.  No, not all of it.  I mean, at first.  All night long.  She was a fast machine.  She kept them automatically nuts.  But cars again.  Sure.  Yeah, of course.  The chorus came later.  About 11 o'clock.  When I...  When I got caught short. 
[03:00:00]  Isn't that amazing?  That is.  He told her I would just rode with laughter.  Because that's typical Brian.  Yeah.  Typical.  Which is great.  Absolutely.  You've got to write what you feel.  Yeah, wherever you're feeling it.  But anyway, listen.  I'm not going to stop you getting interviewed.  No, it's fine.  This is way better than anything.  Yeah, believe me.  Are you kidding me?  You're doing a better job than we're going to do anyway.  So you might as well stay.  Thank you very much.  You're looking great.  You're not some of the way.  Who?  What?  How do you ever shut him up?  Who are? 
[03:00:30]  I stung like bull in fear, no man.  But now that's great.  How about that I got to Jimmy?  Oh, you've got to go to see...  Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer, yeah.  Don't piss off before...  Yeah, piss off.  You can talk.  No, I'll see you before you go.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wait.  So you're in Long Island?  You're going to Long Island?  Yeah.  Okay.  I've got to go to this place.  It's miles away, isn't it?  All right.  Yeah, it's not that bad.  Depends on what time you leave.  Just a book signing.  Hey, Malcolm.  You're so rich, man.  It's so beautiful.  What are you going to buy?  A little Ferrari or something?  I'm picking up when I get to London. 
[03:01:00]  A Ferrari 458 Italia.  What year?  New one?  New one.  Oh, man.  It'll be outside the house, the house in Chelsea.  Wow, but it's Chelsea.  You know, it'll probably have no tyres on it by the time you get it.  No, no, one's got an underground garage.  Oh, good.  One's got a garage under the floor.  Good, good, man.  Good, good.  A garage under it.  In the bluest mountains of Virginia.  Well, what about it's good to be God? 
[03:01:30]  It's good to be God.  It's good to be almighty.  Oh, fuck.  You wrote the fucking book.  I can't remember it.  It was a way of a good.  It's good.  It's good.  It's alarmingly good.  Oh, how it's good to be God.  It's good to determine destinies of a dynasty or a nation.  Oh, mortal should they try to get ideas above this nation.  What of an overwhelming feeling knowing everything is mine.  To be potent's very pleasing.  But omnipotence is mine. 
[03:02:00]  It's good to be me.  God.  And I'm casting it out.  Oh, fuck.  No, that was brilliant.  Did he?  Isn't that?  And he wrote that.  It's a brilliant musical.  Holy shit.  We only need, how much do we need?  Eight million?  That's it?  Absolutely.  We'll get it on.  You'd have to sign a few more books.  Well, yeah, it's, uh, but we'll get it on.  I mean, we just had to stop because of this stuff.  He goes, I've got a great part for you, man.  I went, yeah?  He went, yeah, fucking Zeus, man.  You're fucking Zeus.  And this is your, you're coming in.  You're flying over the fucking audience, man. 
[03:02:30]  On a fucking wire.  And there's, there's, there's, there's fire coming out your ass.  I went, are you serious?  He's fucking right.  I'm serious, man.  And then you land on the stage, and you go, it's good to be God.  It's good to be a man.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Six teams are made of this, I'm telling you.  But you know, great.  Just perfect.  Holy shit, that's hysterical, man.  But we'll do it.  But even if we'll have to do it as a cameo in a big charity, doing them. 
[03:03:00]  We'll do it.  Okay, you know what?  I'll work on it.  Oh, yeah.  I see it.  I saw him as God, but, but, you know, with a top hat on, you know?  Right, right.  Yeah, you know, that's perfect.  David Niven type of thing.  That's hilarious, man.  Oh, shit.  That's fantastic.  Okay, then, gentlemen.  Yes.  I normally wouldn't do this, but I want to get a photo with you, too, and that normally  I would never do something.  Normally, he would never do that.  Can I jump, can I jump in there?  But luckily, we're, we're able to just abandon the radio show and take pictures. 
[03:03:30]  You don't think I'm going to get this fucking picture, too?  You're out of your fucking mind.  Fuck Jim Brewer.  Fuck Jim Brewer.  Now, we're going to interview Malcolm in just a second, but we're doing a picture with him.  Screw the show.  This is Jim Brewer.  You don't get to.  I couldn't.  As soon as I heard the name of him, what the fuck?  And listen, dude, please don't let me just check out all the stories.  I don't want to.  I don't want to just abandon the show.  Malcolm's manager wants one. 
[03:04:00]  Hop in there.  Everyone's hopping in.  It's such a unique, it's such a unique picture.  Yeah, who else is going there?  Danny.  Oh, Danny boy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Danny boy.  This is the movie.  But this is.  This is.  This is.  All right.  They're chit-chatting about the Clockwork Orange.  The 40th.  40th anniversary, right?  They're just yapping.  40th anniversary.  Stanley Kubrick.  It's Clockwork Orange. 
[03:04:30]  We're getting back to the show.  We've lost control.  No, it's fine.  They're chit-chatting.  Malcolm McDowell is in.  Who knew that we're taking photos?  It's fucking.  It's fantastic.  What a great show.  Who knew there were such people?  All right.  Take another one.  He's the producer.  He's not famous.  He's getting Travis's picture.  Now just get the two of them.  Who's running this show?  Yeah, right?  Nobody.  You guys.  Are we done?  No, we have to do the interview.  I thought we did it.  You did it.  You're kidding me. 
[03:05:00]  You took a six.  Take a seat for a little while.  Thank you for coming.  That's it.  Brian, thank you.  Malcolm.  Have you given me the book?  Wow.  I think, yeah.  I'm taking it.  Take the book.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Don't be shy.  Your mother wasn't.  I didn't know you guys were.  We're such pals.  It was amazing.  We're real mates.  Because it's like right when the door opened, you went, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Like, oh, okay.  They do know each other.  We just, yeah. 
[03:05:30]  Man, that is, uh, that's hilarious.  I mean, you always, you always.  I sang one of his songs, you know, and he came down to help me out because I went, I've  never done this kind of thing.  He goes, ah, you just say it like you're just on the phone.  You know, it's, uh, what's odd is you always think, all right, well, England is a pretty  small island.  Everyone's got to know each other.  And then you guys know each other.  Well, there's only 60 million, you know, so, uh, the likelihood is I'll bump into him  somewhere.  Well, two guys of your status, too.  It's like you're, you're going to be aware of each other. 
[03:06:00]  Nobody doesn't know who you are or doesn't know who he is.  Right.  So it's not surprising.  Well, it was just weird because, you know, we went, we were invited, you know, as guests  to go in a helicopter to the British Grand Prix.  Oh, man.  He was, uh, our traveling, you know, uh, partner.  So that was fabulous.  And you realize how quickly, uh, you, you realize how funny he is, man.  Yeah.  He's hilarious.  One of the funniest raconteurs I've ever heard.  And especially with the Geordie accent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So brilliant.  It goes well together.  I love the fact he's still got it. 
[03:06:30]  You know, and he, but when he, the vinyl roofs, that's one of the great stories.  Vinyl roofs.  Man, I've got, I'm doing vinyl roofs tomorrow.  I can't, I can't do the audition, man.  What were you, what were you doing, uh, before you got into acting?  Selling coffee.  No, really?  Yeah, in Yorkshire, where they only drink tea.  That's a lousy job, man.  Really?  You can see I spent most of my time at the cinema.  Oh, did you?  Mm-hmm.  And that, I got, I obviously, uh, got you into wanting to act.  How'd you get into it, uh? 
[03:07:00]  Well, I had a girlfriend who went to, uh, an elocution teacher in Liverpool, which is  where I'm from.  And she went to this lady, Mrs. Harold Ackley, who was an 80-year-old silent movie star.  So I went to see her, and she went, you've got a lovely voice, I think you could do it.  So, uh, you know, I, that's how I kind of got involved, and then I was offered a job  just by chance, and took it in the theater, and that was the end of my coffee.  That was, no more coffee, no more vinyl moves for him, and... 
[03:07:30]  No, no.  Clockwork was the second movie, right?  It was after, uh, If.  No, Clockwork was my fourth movie.  It was fourth movie.  I did, uh, Figures in the Landscape was the second movie I did.  Joe Losey directed it, with Robert Shaw.  And then I did a little English movie called, um, The Raging Moon, which was called Long  Ago Tomorrow here.  It's about a paraplegic, and it's a very nice movie.  And then Clockwork.  Yeah.  With Stanry, and then I went on to do Oh, Lucky Man, which is another great film, and,  um, you know, Lindsay Anderson, again, who was my, if you like, mentor, or whatever. 
[03:08:00]  Certainly a great teacher, and a great man, a brilliant director, and one of the nicest  people ever.  Did you feel that, you said that, I think in, uh, I watched the, the DVD and all the  stuff for the 40th anniversary.  Oh, yeah, it was great.  The, uh, the commentary was amazing.  I never watched commentary.  No.  But it was, uh, didn't you say that, uh, you kind of felt that, uh, Oh, Lucky Man got  overshadowed a bit by Clockwork, and that kind of annoyed you a little bit.  Well, yes, because, you know, that was, I wrote the initial, um, treatment for Oh, 
[03:08:30]  Lucky Man, which starts off about being about a, a guy who was a coffee salesman.  Surprise, surprise.  And who goes on a journey, a rather naive journey through life, um, looking for success.  Uh, which is basically what we all do, isn't it?  Sure.  Yeah.  And we all want to be successful, but at what price?  And, and, uh, the film is a parable, and it's a beautiful film.  Uh, it's still very relevant.  I love the film.  I showed it to some Italian journalists, or about a year ago, with, uh, we've got a big 
[03:09:00]  screen, um, you know, 35 millimeter print, and they came out of this thing, they went,  it's so subversive.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Subversive.  In a way, it's very subversive, because it shows every establishment figure to be corrupt  and basically evil.  So it's pretty accurate.  Well, here we go, you know.  I mean, you said it, not me.  Yeah.  I have a clockwork question that we debated at one point, and I firmly believe this, and 
[03:09:30]  everybody told me I was wrong.  So, when you go back to the writer's house, and, um, when does he, I think he recognizes  you the minute you come in, because he knows you from the newspapers, he knows the guy in  the papers, the one who killed, and they said, no, no, no, he doesn't recognize Alex until  he's singing in the bathtub.  I think he recognized you as soon as you came in.  What is the proper answer for that?  Um, you are wrong.  I am wrong?  Sorry to say.  And I can't argue, because it's him.  The thing is, you are wrong and you are right, because you, because it's really up to every 
[03:10:00]  individual member of the audience to, I mean, it doesn't really matter when he, I mean, if  he does recognize him when I walk in, then why does he wait so long?  So it doesn't really make any sense, but you know, as soon as he recognizes him, because  he has a reaction to it, and then he comes down when I'm eating and goes, food!  All right!  What is it?  We have that.  Try the wine!  Oh, very nice, sir, yes. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, lovely.  Oh, what's that?  Oh, sent his stuff.  Oh, step.  Yeah, lovely.  19, oh, 67.  Lovely.  And you said, he said it felt like he was taking a dump.  Patrick McGee, right, is his name?  Oh, he came to me and he went, what is Malcolm Zyrish, you know, what is with this Kubrick?  He goes, Jesus, I mean, he's making me go so over the top, I feel like I'm chewing the scenery.  I mean, it's the last shot.  I feel like I'm taking a dump.  I'm saying more, more.  I mean, and there's no fucking Guinness on the set. 
[03:11:00]  He said, do you think you could do something about that?  I said, I'll try.  So I went to Stanley.  I went, you know, Stanley, why don't you get the props to just get a couple of Guinnesses for Pat?  So he goes, I don't want drinking on.  I said, no, no, no.  He's Irish.  That's not drinking.  That just lubricates.  You know, it's really just to get him up for the, he goes, so they bought a case which was like 24 small bottles.  And Stanley, three days later, he calls me over and he goes, you know, Malcolm, that wasn't a very good suggestion. 
[03:11:30]  He goes, I went to check on the prop truck how many bottles are left.  He goes, there isn't one.  So he's drunk 24 bottles in three days.  I went, and have you seen how great he's been?  Perfect.  Yeah, exactly.  Scenes are fun.  Did you notice while you were filming it, were you feeling the same thing?  Like some scenes were maybe over the top or a little odd or something.  And then seeing the final version, were you happy with what came out? 
[03:12:00]  I never thought it was odd.  No, because, you know, it is a stylized film.  It's a stylized, you know, it's bigger than life and out there.  And, you know, it's a sort of, you know, I mean, everybody freaks about the violence and stuff.  Well, they did 40 years ago.  Oh, yeah.  Now, it's a comedy.  I mean, I made a black comedy.  You know, that's what I made.  And when it came out, of course, everybody was so stunned with the look and everything else. 
[03:12:30]  Because, you know, it's the first time anyone had seen this look and the bowlers and the cod pieces and the whites and the eyelash and all that kind of stuff.  It was sort of then.  It was absolutely like it was from the moon or something.  And then, you know, the Korova milk bar.  The way it starts off, the first 20 minutes are amazing because it gives you no time to breathe.  It just wham, wham, wham and finishes with singing in the rain. 
[03:13:00]  And, you know, completely ruined that song for people.  No, it didn't.  It made it good.  That song sucked until you grabbed it.  Well, the truth is, you know, we didn't know what to do.  Because in the so-called script, which was just a real skeleton to work from, you know, the boys come in, menace the guy, kick him down the stairs, and then throw bottles of booze through the windows.  And he had all these, you know, sugar glass windows made.  And I'm like, Stanley, that's sort of pathetic. 
[03:13:30]  Who cares?  So, you know, we sat around for five days and didn't turn the camera in.  And I'd come to work, and I'd see Harrod Truck there, you know, from Harrod's, changing the furniture, the look.  And he thought it was there somewhere.  And in the end, he just walked past me, and he goes, can you dance?  And I just, by this time, I kind of got my energy back, and I was getting bored.  So I went, can I dance?  And I went straight into singing.  I just improvised the whole thing of slapping her, whacking, boom, bouncing the ball. 
[03:14:00]  And he was like, get in the car, drove back to his house, and he bought the rights to Singing in the Rain for 10 grand.  Wow.  So cut, a year later.  Then we had to go back, of course, and shoot the thing.  And I'm going, what did I do there?  Anybody write that down?  No, no, no, I had to do it all again.  Anyway, a year later, I came out to Hollywood to meet people at the studio and all the rest of it.  And so this minder said to me, you know, there's this big party in Beverly Hills. 
[03:14:30]  Would you want to come along?  I think there's going to be a few movie stars there.  And I went, yeah, my God, yeah, I'm from Liverpool.  Of course I want to meet these movie stars, you know.  And we go in there, and he goes, you won't believe it, Gene Kelly's here.  I went, oh, my God, how great.  And he had his back to me, and the minder guy just tapped him on the shoulder.  He goes, Gene, I'd like you to meet Malcolm McDowell.  He looked at me like I'd crawled out from a rock, and he just turned and walked away. 
[03:15:00]  Holy shit.  And the guy goes, I do apologize.  I said, don't apologize.  I mean, of course he's upset.  You know, I took his moment, not consciously, but there it was.  You know, Hollywood gave us that as a moment of sheer joy and beauty.  And, you know, to see him slapping the thing and singing in the rain, it's euphoria, isn't it?  And that's how Alex felt when he was raping and beating.  Right, yeah. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, I thought you definitely did a better job with this song.  The choreography in it, the brilliant, the slap, because you wrap tape around her head.  You bite the tape.  It's all timed so beautifully, and Dim trying to sing along, and he just can't do it.  That's the...  Doobie-doo.  Ready for love.  Ready for love.  He just keeps saying that.  Yeah, that's right.  Ready for love.  Very well, little brother. 
[03:16:00]  Very well.  Yeah, and the gene...  Kubrick, you had a great relationship with him, and I was interested in the commentary  when you said that you really never saw him again after the movie.  Did he sever the relationship, or what happened at the end of the movie?  You know, I was a little naive, thinking that, you know, that it would be the same sort of  relationship and friendship that I had with Lindsay Anderson, who directed If, and Who,  Lucky Man?  So, you know, and I was a young actor, and I figured...  I felt like I'd given him everything I had, you know, in the part, and that we worked together for a year, and then suddenly silence. 
[03:16:30]  It was sort of weird.  I couldn't really handle that.  I just thought...  I felt so used, I think, and I felt really angry and upset.  And so, and then, you know, then he kind of had me sign a waiver of forgetting the billing,  saying everybody's name was going to be at the back end of the movie, which was fine with me,  and then I see the movie, and there's Kubrick this, Kubrick that, and Kubrick the other five times. 
[03:17:00]  It's like, you know, we don't count as actors, and, you know, he's not the kind of director that has really any idea about the performance, you know.  You ask any actor that's worked with him, he just goes, show me.  Which is why I love working with him, because it meant that you could literally come with anything.  And I used to joke with him, saying, no wonder you love Peter Sellers.  He could give you 40 different voices and characters, and you'd go with it, you know.  So he was more about the look than he was the performance of the actors, leaving them to... 
[03:17:30]  And he wouldn't turn the camera unless there was magic there.  And he'd wait, he'd wait.  But, you know, I never got the 100 takes and all that stuff.  I mean, that was down the line.  I don't know why he suddenly went into...  He started doing that.  He thought that, you know, if he could, you know, bore them to death and...  With me, I mean, seriously, if we did 10 takes, it was unusual.  And you said you seem to be on the creative process a lot, too. 
[03:18:00]  Like, you said you would watch the dailies, you would talk over what you were going to do,  as opposed to him just going, do this.  Because didn't you...  You guys kind of did the movie from the book, didn't you?  Basically, I had the book with me all the time.  He didn't.  But I'd go, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?  Well, that's not what it...  He goes, oh, what does it say?  And I'd read it out, and he'd go, oh, that's...  I like that.  I like that.  Okay, so, you know, and sometimes he was right.  Sometimes it wasn't in the book.  The book really doesn't give you any hints as to really who this character of Alex is. 
[03:18:30]  It's a sort of veneer, and the book is brilliant.  You know, it's Burgess's masterpiece, but it's, you know, this great political sort of statement  about the freedom of man to choose, you know, whether you want to be immoral or moral.  I mean, that's basically what the film's about, you know, at the end of the day.  And I think why it's lasted so well is that this political element is just as relevant today as it was then. 
[03:19:00]  You know, everything else we've caught up, you know.  But don't forget, when it first came out, I mean, literally, I went to Third Avenue to Cinema One,  and it was jammed.  There were lines, and the whole deal, and people were so excited, the new Kubrick movie,  and they just sat there in stone silence.  And I'm like, what's the matter with these Americans?  Wow.  Haven't they got a sense of humor?  Don't they get it?  Don't they get this?  Jeez, I'm like, oh, they hate it. 
[03:19:30]  They really hate this movie.  Oh, my God, they hate it.  Then one woman in the middle of it runs out into the lobby and throws up.  Wow.  I'm like, oh, my God, I'm really making people so happy.  But the truth was, you know, I hadn't really seen it in England, and it was the same thing.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  It was the same thing.  I mean, they laughed maybe a little more because they got the English humor a bit.  Right, yeah.  But it was, and I understand now, overwhelming in just...  How was it taken by the critics? 
[03:20:00]  They didn't like it.  Like, four nominations, right?  Four Oscar nominations, but didn't win?  Ebert didn't like it, I remember.  Huh?  Roger Ebert gave it two out of four.  Yeah.  What does he know?  Dope.  What an idiot.  But were they...  Sorry to say, but, you know, listen, you can all...  Unfortunately, the critics can always be found out years later.  That is true.  Good point.  And what film are we watching now?  And what was the one that you said was so great?  Yeah.  And what was the Academy Award winners, by the way, that, of course, have never seen the light of day?  Mm-hmm.  Because this film, and not because of any brilliance on the part of Warner Brothers, 
[03:20:30]  although, you know, they have a great department for doing that,  but you can't force a movie 40 years on on the public.  It just ain't gonna wash.  Yeah.  And either they love it or they don't.  Mm-hmm.  And the fact is that this movie has stood the test of time, and it's just amazing.  How many more versions can they bring out, you know?  Yeah.  But they've got this 40th edition Blu-ray, which is actually even better than it was when it first came out. 
[03:21:00]  I was amazed when I saw it.  And it has, just so you know what it has on it, because I've watched almost everything on it.  It's got, of course, the film.  It's got Malcolm's commentary.  And it also has an additional disc, which is about Kubrick as a director.  And it's amazing who you guys got for that, because Malcolm talks in it, obviously.  Cruise narrates it.  He's in it.  Nicholson.  Nicholson never does interviews.  Right.  All these guys talking about Kubrick, Nicole Kidman.  And it's got, on the DVD, it's got this thing about clockwork 40 years later, the making of clockwork. 
[03:21:30]  Fuck it.  If you're a clockwork fanatic like I am, it's amazing what's on this.  Did you see Never Apologize?  Did they send you that, too?  No.  Actually, I was just handed this.  That's great.  I'm very proud of that, because that, you know, it came up because people didn't know who Lindsay Anderson was.  And it really upset me, because he was a genius.  This man was, I mean, just so incredible.  As brilliant as Kubrick was in a completely different way. 
[03:22:00]  Kubrick was a great satirist.  But Anderson was a great humanist, and he loved the human condition and found it, of course, the foibles in it, but, and pointed them out.  But his movies are extraordinary.  And I was asked to go and introduce, they had some kind of retrospective at the Edinburgh Festival.  And I sort of, I was playing golf, actually.  I said, well, I'll do better than that. 
[03:22:30]  I'll come and do a show about him, you know, thinking, oh, it's a year.  I've got a year, but let's think about that.  And I would never get there.  And, of course, six weeks before that, I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm calling up everybody in England, having them send over, you know, diaries and the letters.  And thank God there's a great archive of his stuff at Sterling University, and I was able to get it.  And this is about my relationship with him that led to Stanley Kubrick.  And, um... 
[03:23:00]  Because he gave you clockwork without an audition, right?  Wasn't it from If, I think?  He loved you at If and gave you an audition from that.  Yes, yes, he did.  And, um...  But it was Lindsay Anderson who told me how to play the part in clockwork.  Because I asked Stanley, he goes, hey, Malcolm, that's why I hired you.  I'm not Radha.  And I was like, ooh, okay.  I went, has anybody got a call sheet?  I went, look at this, Stan.  Director S. Kubrick.  How about some direction?  And he just laughed, you know. 
[03:23:30]  But that was the way.  That was a great gift, actually.  But I asked Lindsay if he'd read the script and if he had any notes for me.  And this was before I started shooting.  So he said, he read it, and he called me around to his flat in London.  And, um, you know, as soon as I arrived, he goes, well, thank God I don't have to direct this.  And I was like, look, Lindsay, I know it's not your kind of material.  He said, all right, this is how you play it. 
[03:24:00]  He goes, there's a shot in If when you open the gymnasium doors to be beaten by the prefects.  And you look at them, and you smile.  He goes, that's how you play it.  And I went, oh, my God, he is so right.  And what a brilliant piece of direction.  And that's how I played it.  It was almost scarier that way because you realize here's this smiling, charismatic, very aware guy who's a sociopath.  It was like, yeah, he knows what he's doing, and you still can't connect or get mercy from him. 
[03:24:30]  I thought that made it a much more scary character.  It did.  And, you know, you're right.  And I think, well, as the French critics pointed this out to me, I had not really thought about it, but I think it was the first time in cinema history that, you know, the portrayal of a psychopath who gets the sympathy of the audience without milking it, because, just because of who he is, and that he loves life and Beethoven.  I think one of my favorite lines. 
[03:25:00]  Ludwig van.  Lovely, lovely Ludwig van.  Watching you get more obnoxious as the Ludovico treatment wears off.  Yeah.  Was fucking great.  And I didn't know that it was, you start to notice when they start showing him fun little slides.  And just, you know, I did, which you improv that scene, which was fucking hilarious.  I did, because, you know, we'd done too many takes.  And I said, Stanley, you know, can I just say what the first thing that, he goes, try it.  And so that's what he's chosen. 
[03:25:30]  And it is hilarious because it's so real.  And the energy suddenly picks the film up and just takes you through to the end.  And, you know, I improv'd all the eating, you know, with the minister.  And it's because, you know, that I was bored listening to it.  Stanley was bored.  And he didn't know how to wrap the film up.  But, you know, the poor guy had the whole political speech that he had to.  And so, just out of boredom, I was, and Stanley, like, stuck his handkerchief in his mouth and tears were rolling down his cheeks. 
[03:26:00]  He was laughing so hard.  Oh, that's awesome.  It's such a memorable part of that movie.  I know, I know.  It's hysterical.  But the actor was so pissed.  Oh, really?  Oh.  The idiot that handed Kubrick the script back at the end?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking.  He went, Stanley comes up to me and he goes, you will never believe what just happened.  I went, what?  What is it?  He goes, no, Anthony Sharp, he just gave me the script back.  And I went, yeah? 
[03:26:30]  Well, he probably thinks somebody else wants.  He goes, I've never had an actor give me a script.  I said, well, why not?  He goes, well, they want them for Sylvaniers.  I went, well, here.  Here's mine.  That was, when you were impromptu, the questions she was asking you, that woman, they were so ripe to be fucking had mean shit said to.  There's a guy coming through the window, right?  And the naked woman in bed, he goes, no time for the old in-out, love.  I've just come to read the meter. 
[03:27:00]  You showed me a crummy watch and I'd like my money back.  I'd like to take that watch and stick it up your arse.  Yeah, you laughing with the next break.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Happy laugh.  Very happy at that point, yeah.  Isn't it brilliant, though?  It's a brilliant way of showing that he's back to normal.  Slowly, slowly coming back.  Which is odd, because as the audience, you're like, oh, good, he's back. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  You're like, wait a minute.  He's a serial killer.  He's a psychopath.  Yeah, a psychopath.  And we're all happy about it.  Yeah.  But that's the brilliance of the audience, really.  That's the brilliance of it.  That the hero of the piece is this immoral guy.  Yeah, who you felt bad for when he was being broken like that.  It is really amazing.  But the thing was to make him brutal at the beginning.  So, you know, he's brutal.  And when he's, you know, beating that tramp and, you know,  and he's the big fight with Billy Boy and in the cap, 
[03:28:00]  people hitting him with the dildo.  I mean, that's a brilliant, that's pure Kubrick, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I mean, I went, you've got to be kidding.  This is what I'm going to kill her with?  By the way, Billy Boy and the guy's about to rape that girl.  She probably had the greatest set of tits I've ever seen in a film.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It was that girl that Billy Boy and them were dragging through was fantastic.  I make absolutely no comment on that.  Oh, they were right.  But you're right.  Oh, but the girl that comes out where, you know, when I'm to keep... 
[03:28:30]  Yes, yes.  And she's in the spotlight and she comes out and I go up to touch the old titties and go...  Yeah.  You know, she was a very beautiful girl.  So I heard that she had an antique shop in London and I went into the antique shop and it was like,  it was so weird because, you know, of course, we've all aged somewhat and I'm thinking,  oh, my God.  You know, this is a little middle-aged lady with a little handbag, you know, and I'm going, 
[03:29:00]  you were the tits, right?  Malcolm, that's right.  Because I taught her how to do the bow at the end.  I'm like, no, no, you've got to really relish it, you know, and that was great.  And the guy really hurt you when he stepped on your...  You see that shoe?  The guy who made you lick his shoe, he actually hurt your lung when he fucking jabbed his heel  into your chest.  It went through my ribs.  I was stupid.  I should have put a pad.  Wow.  Yeah, and it went through my ribs and Stanley was like, well, you can't be that sick. 
[03:29:30]  I went, I don't know, Stanley, I can barely breathe.  Holy shit.  And so I went and had an x-ray.  It didn't show up, but there was a blood clot under my rib.  Wow.  I know.  I was very lucky that they caught it and they stuck a big needle between my ribs and dispersed  it.  Yeah.  The clockwork.  The guys working on the electricians, we'd say, you know, Mal, he's trying to kill you.  Are they telling us we have to wrap? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Juan is panicking at the door.  What?  Okay.  We have to wrap with the great Malcolm McDowell.  Oh, man.  I have something I'm going to ask Malcolm to sign.  Normally, I would never.  You've got it.  You've got it.  I'm so happy you're here.  Please say no.  40th anniversary of Clockwork Orange.  It honestly is amazing, the Blu-ray.  It's all this great stuff on it.  Malcolm's commentary is amazing.  This Kubrick Essential Collection is out and something I really want to see is Never Apologize  and it's Malcolm McDowell kind of, you're doing a one-man. 
[03:30:30]  Reminiscing.  Reminiscing.  And reading some of his diaries and letters, which are amazing.  I mean, Anderson is a major, major director, especially in Britain, where he was one of  the great theater directors and, of course, did If, Oh, Lucky Man and Britannia Hospital.  Well, thank you.  We love you.  We love you.  We love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you so much.  And thanks, because I got to see my old mate, Brian.  Yes.  I had a feeling you guys knew each other.  I just want credit for having said that before. 
[03:31:00]  Nobody gives a shit.  I said it.  So I'm right.  I took a guess and I was right.  Who cares?  It was so cool to just see two icons as just pals bullshit like that.  Yes.  Very cool.  I love that guy.  He's a really fabulous guy.  Apparently so.  Yeah.  That's very cool.  Let's get him out of here.  And he got to sing It's Good to Be Gone.  Yeah, he did.  No.  And we got to listen.  Yeah.  It was fabulous.  This was a thrill for us, Malcolm.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  Thanks so much.  Hey, a great pleasure.  Thanks, guys.  I think we're done for the day, too.  Yes.  All right.  We're getting out of here.  Thanks, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:31:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on The Virus.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, The Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  What a last hour.  Good Lord.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And if you haven't been listening, I mean, you should be listening to the whole show anyway, 
[03:32:00]  but if you didn't hear that last hour of radio, I don't know where you were.  It was Brian Young.  Brian Johnson from ACDC was in here.  He did a great interview.  He was awesome to hang out with.  All of a sudden, Malcolm McDowell, who we have booked right after Brian Johnson,  they turned out to be best friends.  Because Roland...  What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up?  ...is having a good day because all day...  Oh, I was getting shit on. 
[03:32:30]  You were getting shit on.  And this was going on during commercial breaks, right?  Yeah.  Because Jim mentioned a little on the air that he was getting to the point where you guys  were arguing about whether or not the curtains were going to be shut.  But Jim, I mean...  Too close.  Too close for...  I just want to say pure genius.  Thank you.  Hello.  Thank you.  Who is the genius?  I just say, let people do their jobs and then things work out.  So you...  I mean, because people on feedback are chiming in, instant classic.  What happened was Brian Johnson from ACDC is just wrapping up and we say, 
[03:33:00]  oh, we have to get to Malcolm McDowell next.  And he goes, Malcolm McDowell's here?  Malcolm?  And he was right outside the door at the time.  They come in.  They meet each other here in the studio.  And I'm, you know, like they...  Fuck off!  Yeah!  And they were best friends.  Who would have thought that they were friends that hadn't seen each other in a while?  They embrace.  They're bullshitting.  We as, like, everybody on staff, there's like four of us just running with mics,  trying to get them in various positions because Malcolm and Brian completely forgot 
[03:33:30]  that they were on the air.  So it was like, I'm sitting there trying to get an angle with the video camera.  You had Travis and Danny and Nagelmeister was trying to get photos for whatever reason.  Oh, for the PR department requesting the photos.  That's crazy!  Yeah, because then all of a sudden, you know, Danny and Travis, everybody's trying to throw  mics in their faces because we're trying to get some of this on the air.  Like you said, the PR department gets wind of this, so mystery people start coming in 
[03:34:00]  and just start taking pictures because they're hugging each other.  They were singing together.  At one point, Brian Johnson from ACDC and Malcolm McDowell are singing together.  I mean, Malcolm McDowell doesn't know what's going on because he can't believe this is a radio show.  I mean, everything's mic'd.  It's all working.  It's all sounding good.  Jim asks for a picture with the two of them, which, because, I mean, who could pass up that  photo op?  And then...  Malcolm McDowell says, who else wants one?  Yeah.  Malcolm McDowell, Anthony comes in for one. 
[03:34:30]  Obi comes in for one.  Everybody.  And Malcolm McDowell sealed his own fate when he said, who else wants one?  You see Malcolm McDowell's manager running in, Danny running in, E-Rock running in, Derek  tried to run in.  Derek missed out.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Eric didn't get one.  E-Rock did not get one.  He was taking pictures.  Oh, he was taking...  Did you get one?  I never get nothing.  Why would I?  You're the booker.  Yeah, why would I do it?  You get any more of those Clockwork Orange Blu-rays?  I didn't get one.  Look, you fucked me out of a Jesse James book.  Don't fuck me out of this one. 
[03:35:00]  I didn't get one.  I never got one.  Don't dick me in the ass.  You know about the dick in the ass.  You know how it feels.  Don't make me feel that.  I never got a Clockwork Orange Blu-ray.  The one I got, the box set, Jamie took from me.  He stole it.  He took it from me.  So what was it like before this magic...  And I mean, I'm telling you guys.  If you didn't hear the whole last hour of the show,  the Brian Johnson and Malcolm McDowell,  it was all one segment pretty much,  the way it melded over.  The show would have gone on.  You wouldn't have had to sit through my nasally voice 
[03:35:30]  if Malcolm McDowell hadn't had someplace to go.  And Jim, as we speak, is interviewing Brian Johnson, correct?  Yep.  For his Boneyard show.  Brian Johnson's sitting there waiting for Jim  because Jim is still interviewing Malcolm.  So what was it like?  I mean, the whole thing ended up great.  The replay starts at 3 in the East,  but you know that by now.  Roland, what was it like dealing with Norton today? 
[03:36:00]  First of all, he's always particular about guests.  He said we should just spread out the time not so close together.  And I said, don't fucking worry.  I got this.  I don't fucking do it.  He's always particular about guests.  Yes.  But Travis and I were talking earlier  that neither one of us,  and I don't know if you,  had any idea,  because this was like Aussie-level obsession.  Like on Aussie days,  everybody here knows, you know...  I think it's almost worse than Aussie days  because Aussie days were all prepped and prepared. 
[03:36:30]  This was a sideswipe.  Like, yeah.  Who knew that he would get this obsessive...  I mean, Brian Johnson was like, cool,  but Malcolm McDowell he went nuts for.  Not to say he shouldn't, but who knew?  He loves him.  Was it a surprise to you,  or did you see this coming?  Because, like, you're the talent booker,  so wrangling guests is pretty much your job.  Some days, you get the easiest job in the world.  Other days, you have the absolute most difficult job in the world. 
[03:37:00]  Did you realize that Norton was going to be  at this level of obsessive Norton today?  When I woke up and heard the birds in the shower,  I go, this is going to be a good day.  You didn't know.  You had no idea.  You went last night,  saw the Hangover 2 with your friends.  Everybody left.  Me and you were texting each other,  figuring out who's in the wolf pack.  By the way, I was thinking about that.  You are Galifianakis.  So, who's Eric?  Eric would have to be...  Kim Jong. 
[03:37:30]  Why? Because of the little...  I fell asleep during that scene, so I don't know.  Oh, yeah, very small penis.  No, I would think that Eric would be Ed Helms.  I can see that.  Which would leave me as...  Bradley Cooper.  I would see that.  Hey, you blessed me, I can see that.  And so good-looking.  Yeah, there you go.  You are the ladies' man.  Now, Roland, tell me,  at what point this morning...  What time did you get here this morning?  Probably 6.30.  Because, yeah, you're not supposed to get here until 8,  but you're always here before 7. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, because of the...  He's going to play a clip or the bet for Tom Papa.  Right.  He's coming tomorrow.  Right, which I'll play that in a second.  I'll play the clip that we recorded at the movie theater.  But, um, at what point, after you got here at 6.30,  at what point this morning did you realize  today was not the day that the birds were going to be singing for you?  Well, I got tagged at 6.31.  Did you?  What did it say?  Is everything...  What show before or after Malcolm?  What's this?  What's that?  I'm like, oh, sweet Jesus. 
[03:38:30]  And then you realize you heard Norton on the air  talking about all the things that he had purchased.  Tables.  Everything has to get signed.  Yeah, well...  Like a lock of hair or whatever.  The table was Nagel's idea.  But the thing is,  where do I put this?  Where do I put this?  Oh, I got you.  And so he's going...  Eric came up with a solution,  said, why don't we just get a table?  He goes, I'm fine with that.  And then...  And then all of a sudden,  he wasn't fine anymore.  Fine with it, yeah.  Well, I mean...  He was excited.  You know, he gets a little antsy at times. 
[03:39:00]  Eric, what was the deal with the table?  Because it became an issue.  What's on?  Is this on?  Yeah, they're all on.  Eric's just trying to save...  Yeah, so Norton said,  I need a place to put it.  And you were like,  here's a table.  And then he goes,  what are you bringing a table in here for?  No, what happened was,  Norton, when he first showed us  the big art portfolio  with these two pristine posters...  Which, to give an update,  both got signed.  Yes.  And photo documented  per Jim's request.  Just like you with your wrestling chair?  Yeah, had to do that.  Why are you making a fist 
[03:39:30]  with Brian Johnson?  Because I didn't know  what he was doing.  He's a boxer.  Well, Eric doesn't know  who Brian Johnson is.  He just took the photo.  Go ahead.  Anyway, so Jim was moving  all this stuff that we have,  like papers, prep sheets,  water, coffee,  to try to fit this huge thing  on the console here.  But you can see  where the mics are.  There wasn't enough room.  It's literally,  it's an art portfolio.  It was probably  three feet across  by maybe two feet tall.  You think he went to FIT?  Yes.  Yeah, so,  my solution was,  remember how,  like at XM, 
[03:40:00]  like at the K-Rock studio,  we had a big table  where, when we were done,  we'd put everything  on the table  so that the guests  would be in studio,  could sign everything  and then leave.  So I'm like,  I'll go and I'll find a table.  I asked Jim,  should I get a table  that will help you out?  He thought it was a good idea.  He did?  Yeah.  Okay, because that wasn't  what we heard on the air.  No, because here's what,  I'll tell you why  he did what he did.  So I got the table,  I explained to him  what I was going to do,  I set up the table,  you know,  and then we had to figure out  where out here  the table was going to go  so the publicist could stand  and what have you. 
[03:40:30]  Jim fought,  because we don't have  the space here,  we used to bring a table  out at 57th Street  and at K-Rock  because we had  these massive studios  and basically an entire floor  to ourselves.  There was always like a corner  or someplace where we could  put the table,  it was out of notice,  it wasn't here,  we have a small studio  and I mean a hallway  that's shared,  we can't put the table  in the hallway  because it's blocking  people walking.  As I was trying to explain  to Jim earlier,  but you know,  he was tunnel vision on this.  I could either put the table, 
[03:41:00]  I'll move this furniture  out over here behind me  and put the table there  or I could put it  right outside  and it was just going  to be the table.  Jim thought we were  going to decorate it  with merchandise  that everybody was going  to get a million things signed.  That wasn't the case.  It was supposed to be  the tables here  so that when he's done  and we have a tendency  to run late with guests,  he could throw his portfolio  on the table  and it's set there right away  and he could have  everything signed for him.  That's what it was for.  Jim asserted.  He said he loves you. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  He's not trying  to take shots at you.  Yeah.  But he said,  we all know  that E-Rock did not  set that table up  just for me.  That is total bullshit.  He, he, he, he...  I talked to everybody here  about facilities  about getting a table  was to prevent  a meltdown  that he couldn't get  his posters on the console.  All Eric wanted to sign  was at ACDC for his wife.  That, that was it.  Yeah.  You didn't have  clockwork stuff?  No.  I did, but I didn't  want to push it.  What about the Star Trek DVD?  I know you were very excited  about Star Trek.  Yeah, but I didn't want  to push that either. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, but you said...  I had it, I just,  I knew what the situation was  so I was not going to push it.  Because you're the  autograph king around here.  You won't deny that.  No, I'm not.  What?  I'm the prince.  Well, I mean,  aside from, from the host,  you know, Jim is obviously  the autograph king.  Yes.  But host aside,  you are the autograph king.  It depends.  That the king is a whore.  I can't be good.  Ow!  The autograph whore.  You do get a lot of signature.  You get more autographs  than anybody else.  Well, it depends.  But what you say...  Some stuff hangs up  in the office. 
[03:42:30]  Like with the wrestlers, yes,  because a lot of that  goes to my nephew.  Okay.  I get one for me  and the rest of it  goes to my nephew.  You, your nephews have...  Shut up.  ...better autograph collections  than most sports memorabilia  collectors at this point.  That's what you should do  with this position.  You know, if you can't  spoil your nieces and nephews,  why not?  I guess so.  I'd never do  with my nieces and nephews.  You don't?  I don't have any.  Are you going to get  the thing signed  for our friend  up in Connecticut?  I got that signed.  Yeah, that's already done.  So, yeah.  So, Joe's...  Don't...  Yeah, Joe in Connecticut.  Don't worry 
[03:43:00]  about what he does  in Connecticut.  And guess what?  WWE?  I don't know.  So, if that's...  Don't, don't.  It went unsaid.  People know  what's in Connecticut.  Why?  And it's associated  with me and E-Rock.  And Randy and  Munchman Savage.  But let's just say...  A poll?  Are you putting, like...  When you package  the DVD that you're  sending in Connecticut,  Yes.  Will there be room  for, like, a resume  or something?  Well, one, it's a Blu-ray.  And two, no,  because they think  you're a bully.  Don't tell them.  Why do they think  I'm a bully? 
[03:43:30]  They told me that.  Well, I don't know.  And they're part  of that organization  that prevents, you know,  bullies.  Enjoy the Blu-ray, Joe.  So, you didn't get  anything for yourself?  From Malcolm?  No.  Because I...  I got one for my brother.  That was it.  And you barely  ever get anything.  Plus,  Roland,  you booked him.  Yeah.  So, you know,  because I was sitting  here this morning  when I got here.  I was like,  ah,  because I got a picture  with Malcolm McDowell  at a comic convention  or a horror convention.  It was a chiller theater, 
[03:44:00]  wasn't it?  No, it was...  I don't know,  who cares?  Monster Mania, maybe.  It was one of the ones,  but I got...  It's a great picture.  And I had it printed  like last week  to make sure I had it,  you know?  And I got here  and I realized  I'd forgotten it at home.  And I was like,  oh, I can't believe  I forgot it.  Once the show started  and Jim started talking  about what he was doing  and the vibe started  getting made clear  around here,  I was like,  thank God  I don't have that picture.  Which led to Jim  thinking that the table  was for all of us 
[03:44:30]  to put a million things out  for Malcolm to sign  when it was to try  to prevent a meltdown.  What are we waiting for?  I'm waiting on Jim.  Okay,  because I just saw  Jim Brewer out there.  Are you supposed  to take a picture  or something?  Well,  that and a few other things.  He still has more stuff  for Malcolm to sign.  What?  So I have to handle that.  No,  you should bring him  in here to sign it.  But they'll hit you liners though.  Yeah,  I'll see what I can do.  Unless you want to do  like Ron and Fez does  two hours of liners.  So anyway,  in short,  the table was to help Jim out.  I'm sorry. 
[03:45:00]  That's all it was.  And then Jim turned it  into even worse  than what the original intention  was supposed to be.  Yeah,  because Jim definitely said  that that table was,  you would have put  his stuff on there,  but you would like  to put a little something  for the Nagel Man on there.  A little treat for yourself.  That's what Jim said.  Jim had like nine things.  Well,  that table would have  taken care of all of that.  You're saying the table  wouldn't have been able  to withstand the weight  of more things.  No,  no,  no,  I'm not saying that at all.  that one thing  that Jim wanted to sign  that he signed,  he went,  please. 
[03:45:30]  And Michael goes,  I'll sign that later.  He goes,  okay.  Yeah,  Jim got a little,  he was a little hurt,  but he did a,  I don't know if it was  his little fuck like that.  Tell me.  He did.  Because he didn't get  some of the other things signed yet.  This brings up a good thing.  You,  are you guys,  you guys got to go?  I don't know.  Oh yeah,  he's wrapping up.  What's going on?  He's wrapping up right now,  Jim.  Yeah,  no,  all right,  you can go take care of that.  Is he taking care of?  I got another minute.  Is he taking care of Brian Johnson?  Yeah.  Oh,  okay.  Jim should come back in here 
[03:46:00]  if he's walking by.  when you have to deal,  how would you say Norton is,  like,  because he is still,  he still had to interview  Brian Johnson after today's show,  but the big thing  that he was nervous about  was how Brian Johnson  and Malcolm McDowell  were going to do on O&A  with him here and everything.  Yeah.  What's his vibe like?  immediately after  it happens.  After both guests?  Like,  because of all this hype  and he's been nervous  and everything,  once it's over 
[03:46:30]  and it was successful,  what's his vibe like?  What's Jim Brewer doing out there?  He's dancing crazy.  He's rocking out.  Jim Brewer's playing air guitar  outside the studio.  The vibe was,  it went well.  Here it is.  Jim was like,  this was amazing.  Brian Johnson was great.  Brian and Malcolm together  was amazing.  Malcolm was great.  Got some of his stuff signed,  annoyed that the rest of it  wasn't signed.  He still has that.  Because he had to go  interview Brian Johnson again,  which was fine. 
[03:47:00]  He wants to do that for,  it's his Boneyard show, right?  Yeah.  But,  now we're trying to coordinate  so when Norton is done,  and there goes Brian Johnson,  so I gotta go find Norton.  When Norton's done with that.  What's Travis going with them for?  To coordinate  when Malcolm's done  doing this other interview.  And then he has one more interview  right next door.  With who?  I'm guessing Al Q.  Oh, Malcolm.  Malcolm.  So I gotta have all this stuff ready  so Jim can coordinate the time  to get Malcolm out of  the second interview 
[03:47:30]  after we've been done.  Do you think?  I can't even explain this right.  It's hurting my head.  Roland's explaining  all of this to Jim right now.  What's up, D-boy?  Oh, fuck.  That's not like shit.  What does?  Mic technique.  Mic technique?  He didn't like the other mic  on right next to me.  Oh, oh.  Okay.  He's a maniac.  Pop out so when he comes  out of the bathroom  I get a picture with him.  Okay, who?  Alright.  Malcolm?  Yeah.  And Travis? 
[03:48:00]  I already have a picture.  I'm asking for the audience  not for me, Roland.  I have no idea.  Do you think the whole time  Jim was interviewing  Brian Johnson  he was sitting there  thinking about  getting stuff signed?  At the very beginning, yes.  Then when it started  getting deep into the conversation  when they're talking  about the race cars  and Jim's talking about  the book getting blown  and different cars  up until about  five minutes before.  Oh, how did, how did  what?  Stretch.  Stretch.  Stretch what? 
[03:48:30]  Everybody's in here.  I don't have to stretch anything.  He's looking for his stuff.  Yeah, you grab that one  and then leave that on that.  You gave it to Roland?  So one of you guys  brought it to me?  You didn't give that to me.  Hang on.  Roland had to have taken him.  Nobody would have taken  anything off that chair.  Oh boy.  Eric's running.  Did you lose some of your stuff?  What?  Did you lose some of your stuff?  No, I just want to get  I didn't take a picture  with Malcolm  but I knew we'd have time after.  Yeah, I think he's doing 
[03:49:00]  out cue they said right now.  Is that what he's doing right now?  I believe he is.  He's doing the liners  as I left it there  so we can sign out the liners.  Oh, in Derek's studio.  Oh, okay.  I just want to sign one to Otto  because I promise  Malcolm's done.  Yeah, I'll find out.  It's still stressful in here, Troy.  It's been absolute insanity.  You were with Jim  when he was recording  Brian Johnson?  Brian Johnson over  in the other studio.  For the Boneyard show.  Yeah, Brian Johnson  was waiting for him  to come out of the studio  and now Brewers is going in.  It's just been...  How is the Brian Johnson interview? 
[03:49:30]  Oh, it's great.  It's going to air on...  Travis, what in God's name  is going on in the hallways?  I see you running around  in the hallways.  What is happening?  Well, Roland, you know,  I want a picture of Brian Johnson.  He's a legend.  Gotcha.  So Roland's like,  yeah, he's going to go  to the bathroom  and then Brewer's  going to interview him  but you should get a picture  right before Brewer interviews.  I'm like, you know,  I trust Roland.  Roland always gets it done.  He delivers.  So I'm just going with the flow.  And Eric,  what are you doing  running around?  I'll tell you in a minute.  Oh God, he's exhausted. 
[03:50:00]  I bet it has something  to do with an autograph.  I can't believe...  I thought that the vibe  would be calm now  and everybody would be cool  because the segment went well.  Yeah.  It's chaos still.  And it's chaos  even after it's been assured to us  that Malcolm has plenty of time afterwards  to take care of anything Jim needs.  He will.  Did we find it?  What's Brian doing right now?  I think Brian is doing Jim Brewer.  What's Malcolm doing?  Malcolm is... 
[03:50:30]  He's doing Al-Q, right?  Yeah, Malcolm's doing Al-Q.  Did I get a sign or no?  What is it?  No, it's been driving you nuts.  Don't get a sign.  I don't know if I should get...  Yeah, I'll get the program sign.  You know what's the weird thing?  You can always get a new one.  No, you can't.  That's the thing.  There are certain things  that are more valuable not signed.  I don't care about the value.  Like monetary value.  It's not a money thing.  I'm never selling to this shit.  Well, as many Malcolm McDonald's  signatures as you have, 
[03:51:00]  would it mean more to just have that?  Do you need the signature on it?  Will it add anything to it?  Right, probably not.  Because you have him...  Like, the cool thing that you got  when he signed that poster,  the skinny one that you were talking about,  he said he had never even seen it.  He'd never seen it before.  Like, that's cool to get signed.  Yeah.  And you got him to sign that  and the Japanese poster.  You might leave that unsigned  just to have it.  Yeah, I do kind of like this like this.  It's so cool, man.  What is it?  Is it a movie program? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, they used to hand these out  in the theater.  Um, I've never seen it.  Oh, it's too hard to get out.  Yeah, you don't want to damage it.  What's he doing?  You're going to bring both guys by  to that table  so you get your stuff signed.  I don't need Brian to come by.  I feel bad.  I don't want to be...  We got kind of rushed.  I'm obsessed today.  I know.  We were talking.  That's all we've been talking about.  How you...  You...  But the interviews weren't good, right?  The segments were incredible.  Like, the whole segment  and the crossover was amazing  when they knew each other.  They're both too famous 
[03:52:00]  not to have known each other  or at least be aware of each other.  Yeah.  And Brian for the Boneyard show  is going to be great.  It's going to air this Friday.  Oh, yeah.  He was good, right?  He was awesome.  He was great.  Jim, we were all talking about  that like when it's an Aussie day,  there's Brewer and Brian Johnson right now.  No, no, no.  Let them go.  They're going to do an interview.  No, no, no.  Jim, Eric.  Eric.  No.  He's letting him go.  Yeah, no.  Don't interrupt him.  We were all saying that  when it's an Aussie day here,  we know.  Like, if there's an Osborne coming in,  we know, okay, you know,  this is an obsessive day for Jim. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Obviously, you know,  and as it should be.  None of us had any idea  that like you were going to react  to Malcolm McDowell this much.  Like, we didn't know you were this obsessed  with Clockwork and Malcolm.  Well, it's like Clockwork is one of my favorite movies  of all time, if not my favorite.  I've said that for so many years.  Yeah.  And Malcolm's character is, you know,  come on, he's Alexander DeLarge.  Which, I'll probably never have the chance again.  It's like, when do you have the chance 
[03:53:00]  to hang out with a guy  or talk to a guy that you love so much?  You just don't.  I was thinking that while you were talking to him  because you did a lot of the interview  and you did a great job, but I mean...  I didn't mean to hog the mic to Opie.  No, you weren't.  Okay, I didn't mean to do that.  It was not intentional.  I think Opie and Anthony realized that,  you know, you being like,  everybody's a fan of that movie,  but you in the room were the super fan.  Plus, you were the one  who would watch the DVD and everything.  Yeah.  Was it...  Do you like...  Because you say when you get pictures  that you don't like to stop and talk to them.  Like, you like to take the picture and go.  Do you like doing interviews like that, though? 
[03:53:30]  Love it.  Yeah, when I'm talking to somebody,  I'm very comfortable.  Like, I just did Brian Johnson  on The Boneyard for Friday  and I was very comfortable talking to him one-on-one.  I'm almost more comfortable in a room alone with him  because I have to listen.  Yeah.  I don't know why I'm answering it.  Like, you just said,  Jim, explain your amazing interview techniques.  I'm just a fucking faggot fanboy.  Hey, thank you for singing.  I'm acting like I'm way more than I am,  but it's fucking Malcolm McDowell, dude.  And he was a nice guy.  And, you know, look,  he got to hang out with Brian Johnson  by coming on the show. 
[03:54:00]  And I know I'm going to plug the DVDs properly.  Like, I'm going to do them justice  and plug what he likes  and happily plug it.  So I feel like we give something, too.  It was pretty funny when after Brian Johnson left,  he goes,  Okay, so am I done?  Is that the interview?  Can I go?  Who, Brian?  No, Malcolm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He thought he was finished.  No, you haven't even started.  He smelled really good, too.  Malcolm did?  Yeah, he smelled like really rich English.  British guys always smell good.  Lemmy always smell...  Oh, not only.  Fucking Halford smelled great.  Didn't smell bad?  Lemmy didn't smell bad,  but he smelled like fucking booze. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, Roland.  Roland's the one person  that gets Jim every time  because he's so nervous  about the celebrities  that Roland just takes advantage.  Do I want to get this signed or no?  Yes.  No, I don't...  Because if you don't get it signed,  then you go,  Why did I get it signed?  Will you do that?  Yeah.  Yeah, I will.  I will.  You will?  Okay, well then Roland's right.  Have you met him  outside of conventions before?  No, I only met Malcolm once  thanks to Big Kev.  Yeah.  I got a picture with him.  And again,  Oh, fuck!  I forgot to ask him about Caligula.  Fuck!  Let's get him back in here.  I don't think he'll do  the after shit show. 
[03:55:00]  I don't know why would...  Because he's got five minutes.  Do I want to take a picture  or have him do this fucking  no-listener show?  There's listeners.  It was fucking great,  him and Brian Johnson being in here.  And you got most of that on tape.  Where's my fucking little video camera?  I wrapped it in my head.  Oh, thank you, Irock.  I fucking...  I'm really out of sorts today  because I knew this would be a big day.  Were you worried that Malcolm  would be like not cool?  No, I knew he'd be cool.  You knew he would.  No, I knew he'd be cool,  but I hope the signature...  I have fucking cardboard under it  and I hope the signature's not like crooked.  It's okay, I think.  There's a cardboard in there.  Oh, fuck, dude.  I hope not. 
[03:55:30]  Smear.  Cocksucker.  I was watching old interviews with him.  Because Malcolm didn't want...  Sorry to interrupt you.  No, you go ahead.  He didn't want me to fucking smear it either.  He's like, make sure it's not smeared.  And you go, no, no, no,  the cardboard's fine.  I hope it did get smeared.  Remember, our second day  is going to be June 7th.  What do you mean?  Bernard Hopkins and Ture Ray.  No, no, no.  June 7th is fucking Brock.  Oh, Brock.  And Sugar Ray Leonard.  Wow.  Well, at least you've already...  And then fucking Vincent D'Onofria.  Yeah, he may be the next day  to spread it out.  At least you've already met Brock, though,  so you won't be so... 
[03:56:00]  Are they smeared?  No, wait.  He's checking his art portfolio now.  Sucker, can someone help me?  He does look like he goes to Tish at NYU.  What did you say, Eric?  No, it's FIT final.  Yeah.  I said, this is why he needed the table.  Yeah.  What do you want us to say?  You were right about the table?  Yes.  Eric took umbrage, by the way,  that you thought that he was getting the table  not just for your stuff,  but for his stuff, too.  Looks a bit smeared from this side.  No, it doesn't.  I can't see it.  That looks good, right?  Does that look like it's signed poorly? 
[03:56:30]  It looks pretty good,  and he wrote video well on it.  Yeah.  You gotta like that.  The only thing is,  it's right by the end of the fucking thing.  That's what he says in Clockwork.  The frame's gonna cut it off.  A little bit, yeah.  Fuck.  Or if he gets...  I haven't re-signed it over there.  Yeah, I got this Clockwork Orange poster,  super rare,  and signed by Malcolm McDowell twice.  No, but it's right by the end,  so actually,  the, uh...  It's shit.  The piece is gonna go over it by, like...  But if you get the extended...  Yeah, you get it mounted,  so it's in the center,  and then you have a...  No, you don't mount it.  I'll never mount it. 
[03:57:00]  You know, it's great, though,  because there's two L's in his name,  so at least the first L will be there,  so you'll see who it is.  No, no, no, no.  Just the second L will get cut off.  Uh, it's...  You're gonna miss that much.  That's it.  Get it matted.  You don't...  Eric!  Hey!  Get it matted.  Cut off the signature.  We're just trying to help you, Jim.  Trying to help you with the...  I know, he's signed right by the end  on both of these.  Just get it matted.  Just cut it with...  You have a small mat.  Cut it with the scissors.  You know?  They can matt it,  and then that way  there's a little bit of a border,  and then the frame will...  This is great.  Or get some nail polish.  Get some nail polish. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, he's signed too close to the edge,  but I can't pitch.  Well, because you didn't pull the posters  out all the way  because you were in a rush.  Yeah, but I also didn't want  to damage the posters  because if I pulled them out  all the way  and they got fucked up,  I would have all...  How great would that have been  if Opie and me  were both filming you  and you pull out your poster  and it tears?  You just hear a...  Would you have been upset?  Yeah.  I don't think that would have been  great at all, actually.  No?  No.  Do you want the truth?  I'll figure out a way.  All right.  We're good. 
[03:58:00]  So you're going to get  Otto's thing signed  and you are going to get  the program signed?  Yes.  Okay.  I might as well.  I was saying before  when you were opening...  Eric took umbrage  that you thought  that he was putting  the table out  not just for you  but also so he could put  his little treats on there too.  You know, I love Iraq, but...  Let's be honest.  What was he doing that for?  Who did I learn it from, I guess?  Exactly.  Who, Jim?  Yeah.  Oh.  But now that Jim's in here  you're not saying that  Jim was wrong.  I said it to him already.  The table was just there for him.  I don't believe that either. 
[03:58:30]  Troy, do you believe it?  No comment.  No, for a second.  I got to piss.  I'll be right back.  Okay.  Troy, when Jim was doing his...  There should be no beverages  on that table.  That was brewers.  Well, somebody...  Why isn't anybody  watching the table?  I know.  Eric...  Yeah, it's his idea.  Go watch the table, Eric.  All of a sudden,  it's a garbage heap.  Yeah.  When Jim was doing  the interview with  Brian Johnson,  did it seem like  when am I going to get  signed by Malcolm 
[03:59:00]  and Dow was on his mind?  No, Jim's amazing like that.  He can pull it together  so quick and get in the zone  and handle his shit.  He was together?  Yeah.  Wow.  Did he pass gas, Eric?  Oh, yeah.  Is that what you're smelling?  It's very sour  coming from the hallway  into the studio.  Guming from the hallway?  Sorry, I was drinking.  Coming from the hallway  into the studio.  Everybody's...  He's nervous.  ...freaked out.  Roland's running  all over the place.  Spencer and Laura  have been pacing  back and forth.  Who knew?  Well, Jim can send 
[03:59:30]  everybody into a tizzy.  That's what it is  because he gets  everybody involved.  He panics.  He panics  and then everybody else panics.  He just starts sending  emails to everybody.  Like, if he just stayed calm,  everything would be calm  and full and smooth.  But if he stayed calm,  what if it didn't get done?  Well, I guess he just has  to put the fear  into everybody  to make sure this happens.  I'll tell you this much.  When Jim wants  to get something done,  it tends to get completed,  does it not?  It does.  I mean, no matter what office...  And if it's not getting  completed around here,  he will walk down  that hallway  and keep going. 
[04:00:00]  All right, I'll go above you.  I'll go above you  until he's upstairs.  He's not afraid  to go into every single office  until whatever he needs done  gets done.  I mean, even Steve Leeds  was running around here.  What's Steve Leeds doing?  Steve Leeds was checking  on Brian Johnson.  My God.  Remember poor Steve Leeds  with the J-Lo picture  for Jim?  Oh, God.  How could I forget?  That's when we got a replay  when Steve Leeds  was going...  Chasing her around.  Chasing J-Lo around  and Jim couldn't  focus on the show  because he kept 
[04:00:30]  paying attention  to what Steve Leeds  was doing?  Patrice kept telling him  that, oh, you're missing her,  you're missing her  and he kept turning around.  Oh, my God.  So is the autograph table  out there intact?  Yes, it's all intact.  It's ready.  Jim's reorganizing it  from how it was organized.  So are you trying  to get your Star Trek sign?  Now I will.  Oh, look at Eric  who puts his stuff  down on the gym table.  Well, now that he's  coming back,  I wasn't before.  I was thinking  when you were on the air today  and they were playing  Best of E-Rock clips.  Yeah, that was awesome.  And you kind of went in there 
[04:01:00]  and you said,  yeah, I might not do  this physical fitness thing.  Yeah.  Normally,  like three weeks ago,  they would have said,  fuck you, fatty,  you're doing it.  Today,  Opie's going,  well, I hope Eric does it.  Like an aunt's like,  come on,  will you please?  Like it seems like  you kind of put  the fear of God  in him last week.  I mean, am I wrong?  No, absolutely.  Didn't it like,  that segment,  like I'm sitting there  trying to hype it up,  but Opie and Anthony  are going, 
[04:01:30]  oh, I hope Eric does it.  It's up to him, I guess.  And I go, what?  When did this happen?  Well, I can't speak for Opie,  but just from what  he was saying today  about the hockey poster,  he's,  I think there's some guilt  there that he did  what he did with it.  And again,  I can't speak for him,  but just kind of  what he said  on the air today.  By the way,  in terms of the  Hangover 2 movie, Eric,  I didn't go with Opie.  Stanley T invited me  to go with the mashups  and then Opie,  so don't get jealous.  Stanley T told me yesterday.  Don't get jealous  that me and Opie  were hanging out again.  I'm not.  What are you writing down? 
[04:02:00]  Something to Travis.  Just tell me.  I'm just going to tell him  to blow out the promos.  Just blow out the promos.  We have all the breaks left,  so.  The promos in profit?  That's the beauty of that.  Oh, why would he be  wearing headphones?  He wants to know,  you're talking about  the promos in profit?  No, the channel promos  in profit.  Yeah, you can blow those out.  We just got to do  the commercials.  Just kill all the commercials.  No, don't kill the commercials.  Just delete commercials.  No, that causes  a huge ordeal.  Why?  Because they're paid for.  Yeah, but who cares?  You can't just say,  hey, we're not going  to play these.  Yeah, we can.  I mean, we can. 
[04:02:30]  So get rid of the  Joe Rogan experience promo?  You don't want to  plug that, Eric?  We played it once already  during the show.  Eric Nagel doesn't want  to plug the Joe Rogan.  No, that's not true.  Not with you, Eric.  Let's not plug that.  We're out of time.  Bullshit.  We have three breaks left.  Three?  Yeah.  No, we don't.  We have two.  Wait, why would we have two?  52 is our out.  Oh, you were going like this.  I thought you meant  He's saying three minutes.  Even I picked up on that  and I didn't even see  the exchange.  I thought he was doing  that meaning three breaks.  It was 49 and he put up  three fingers.  52.  Yeah.  And I was mouthing 
[04:03:00]  how many breaks  and he went like that.  And then I said  that I did two  and then the break sign.  Travis, I would like to think  that if we had three breaks  you would have told me  before now.  Absolutely.  Three breaks is an oddity.  See, Travis handles  his shit in there.  As opposed to what?  Travis handles his shit in there.  Wow.  Let's see you do it.  Hey.  Roland?  Go ahead.  Roland, update?  Troy Kwan's going to be  DJing in Philadelphia.  Check that out.  No.  No?  Bethlehem this Friday  at the Tally Hill.  Thank you, Roland.  Who goes to Bethlehem  to party? 
[04:03:30]  Nobody.  It's great.  Great spot.  Yeah, the Amish.  That's a cool spot.  It's by Lehigh University?  Yes, it is.  How do you know?  You've never been there.  I've been to Lehigh.  I toured Lehigh.  All the puppies in the house  go woo woo.  And I decided not to go  to college there.  Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  Tally Hill this Friday.  It's whack as shit.  Yeah.  Troy's going to bring  the flavor though.  I'm going to be there.  You are?  Yes.  On Saturday.  Friday night.  Friday night.  I'm going to be there.  By the way, special delivery  is changing its time  on Saturday.  8 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Eastern.  I just heard you just 
[04:04:00]  called special delivery  with Sam and the other  guy's gone.  I don't know if that's  the case.  I think Dave will probably  be here with me.  You did lose an hour though.  I did.  So you didn't tell Dave  about the meeting  about accident?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Again, I don't quite know  what you're talking about  but who's at the door?  Norton.  Oh.  Norton, we're wrapping up.  Is there anything  you want to say?  About what?  I mean...  It's the end of the show.  Cool.  Does it look like  the Malcolm McDowell thing  is going to happen? 
[04:04:30]  Where is he?  Did he leave him?  He's in the Al-Q studio.  What's he still doing  in Al-Q?  He's there until 11.  11?  He's in the Al-Q.  And then...  So yeah, I want to get  something signed for Otto  because I told him I would.  Yeah.  I want to get a...  I didn't take a picture  with him.  This is a cool video.  You had the photos  of me and Brian  and...  That was cool, right?  Yeah, it was really cool.  I had to do that.  By the way,  Piggy did put his DVDs  on your table out there.  Not earlier.  Jim predicted it.  It came true.  Look, we got to go.  Ron and Fez are coming.  Didn't Ron also 
[04:05:00]  just tape an interview  with Malcolm McDowell?  Did he?  Yes, he did.  He went to after us.  That's awesome.  Oh, Ronnie.  That should be good.  Not as good as us  because we had...  What's his name from ACDC?  But...  Brian Johnson.  Well, I got a million things  going on in my head right now.  I'm trying to steer  this sinking ship.  I didn't mean to make it  all about me today.  I apologize.  No.  But I mean,  it wasn't intentional.  I just...  I'm a fucking lunatic  with this stuff.  Opie and Anthony  didn't even watch the Blu-ray.  But I mean,  like with the pictures and stuff,  it's not that I think  I'm more important  than anybody else. 
[04:05:30]  I really don't.  I just freak out.  The pictures thing  turned into like a funny thing.  I just freak out, man.  And it's fun for us  to comment on.  We did the whole hour  of this after show  talking about you  being obsessive  and freaking out.  He's just the boy.  Don't listen to the replay.  I don't want you  to get offended.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Opie and Anthony  and after Opie and Anthony Live  continue tomorrow.  Wow.  And that's when we'll find out  if Jim was successful  getting the rest  of his stuff signed.  I only have...  I only want one more thing.  I'm not going to get 
[04:06:00]  a whole bunch of stuff.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Ron and Fez are next.  The Opie and Anthony show  is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
