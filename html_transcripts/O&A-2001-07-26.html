<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast opened with a humorous exchange about a listener's first sexual experience, followed by promotion of O2Go oxygenated water.  A significant portion of the show focused on a "Man Boob" contest, sponsored by GoldenPalace.com and a doctor offering free corrective surgery.  Photos of contestants, described as ranging from "scary" to "disturbing," were shown on the opiandanthony.com website and discussed with graphic, sexually suggestive language.  Listeners called in to discuss their entries, and one caller, "Little Stevie,"  became a focal point due to his significant gynecomastia, prompting discussions about fundraising for corrective surgery and the cost thereof.  A caller who had undergone a similar procedure also shared their experience.  The show even displayed a framed photo of another caller's brain tumor in relation to his gynecomastia.  A caller recounted discovering his missing SUV at a dealership months after leaving it there.  

The show featured extensive in-studio musical guests: Richard Cheese performed several parody songs, including a version of "Stairway to Heaven," alongside Lounge Against the Machine, who played cover songs with altered lyrics, including a provocative rendition of Nirvana's "Rape Me" and covers of Weezer's "Hash Pipe" and Nine Inch Nails' "Closer."  Frank Caliendo, also a frequent guest, performed comedic bits including a Seinfeld parody where he killed off Newman and other impressions.  His recent signing with *Mad TV* was also discussed.  The Naked Cowboy, a Times Square street performer, also made a significant appearance, with discussions focusing on his attire, earnings, and interactions with the public, including humorous ratings of his attractiveness. A brief interaction with a Ted Knight character impression also occurred.   

A substantial portion of the broadcast involved a heated debate about Opie and Anthonyâ€™s perceived rivalry with Howard Stern, centered on accusations of Stern appropriating their catchphrases ("balloon knot," "rusty trombones," "Cleveland steamers").  Callers overwhelmingly supported Opie and Anthony's claims of originality.  The hosts also defended their use of internet video clips and their radio style against accusations of unoriginality.  

The show also included a lengthy discussion of Miss Cleo and her fraudulent psychic services, featuring calls from former employees detailing the scam.  Garrett Morris's rambling and often nonsensical previous interview was played, highlighting his unpredictable behavior and featuring inappropriate and offensive jokes.  A recurring bit featured "Ass Man," a significantly overweight contestant who, prompted by the hosts, exposed his genitals on air, resulting in a horrified reaction from the intern, Rachel.  The entire broadcast was peppered with crude humor, offensive language, and sponsor reads, including for Lifestyles condoms and Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  Anthony mentioned his upcoming attendance at a Madonna concert.  The "F.U." segment concluded the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by O.P. and Anthony, all owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  Our listeners are so quick and with it.  Steven.  Or whoever your name is.  All right.  Steve?  Yeah, well, yes, you.  You just spoke.  Go ahead, talk.  You.  Yeah, me.  Yeah, what's your name?  Steven.  Well, what?  You f***ing asshole. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Son of a bitch.  O.P. is very upset.  All I want to do is just a bitch.  How stupid do you have to be to be on the phone and someone calls your name and you don't answer?  All I want to do is just a bitch.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You f***ing asshole.  Shut up.  Shut up.  No. 
[00:01:00]  You f***ing asshole.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Ah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Did he just lose his effing mind?  No.  O.P. and Anthony.  I hate people that don't get it.  God damn does that piss me off.  I'm a freaking lunatic.  You are.  Yeah.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  What's up, Anthony?  What's slamming him? 
[00:01:30]  Phone numbers if you're in New York, 877-692-1027.  The national number, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Let's go right to the phones and talk to Ralph.  Ralph, what's up?  How you doing, O.N.  All right, man.  Yo, come on, guys.  Start with playing up on their morning.  What?  Stern was playing that Monday morning.  Stern was playing that song Monday morning.  Yeah.  And why does that matter?  I mean, you know, you guys can try to be a little more original. 
[00:02:00]  Hey, did he write that?  Hey, Ralph, douchebag.  Every freaking radio station in the market playing that song, you idiot.  Everyone's playing it.  Why?  Did he write it?  Did he perform it?  Dude.  That song is being played on about five radio stations in New York alone, you douchebag.  What's wrong with you, man?  Yeah, hang up.  Ugh.  You want to talk about something Howard's doing?  He's using all our phrases on his stupid show and embarrassing himself. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Don't get me started.  Where are the calls for balloon knot?  Another terminology we've been using on this show.  Rich, what's going on?  What's going on, ONA?  Hey, man.  This morning, I don't care, I don't know if you guys didn't care or not, but I heard balloon knots, rusty trombones, Cleveland steamers.  Yeah.  He's using them all this morning.  Of course.  Of course.  That's what he does.  And then he says everyone is ripping them off.  If he finds the best stuff other jocks are doing, he uses them, and then he yells and screams that everyone rips him off. 
[00:03:00]  Let me tell you something.  Balloon knot, we've been using that stupid term on this show for, I don't know, well over three years.  Hell yeah.  My brother came up with the term years ago.  Funny line.  No, it's so funny that Howard's using it.  Great.  But don't go yelling and screaming that everyone's ripping you off.  You look kind of stupid today.  If our listeners are tuning in your show and you're making believe that you're coming up with all these terms, you'd be a hypocrite. 
[00:03:30]  And the brainwashed listeners, just please.  Because you play a song that wasn't written or performed by him, and he's played it on the show along with many other radio shows in New York.  It's a fun song.  It's a pretty cool tune, right?  Yeah, I love it.  Yeah.  It's a feel-good song.  A good way to start the show today.  And you're so brainwashed that that is ripping him off?  How the hell do you get to that point in your life where you call us up, hey, do something original? 
[00:04:00]  Does that mean anybody that plays, you know, you play a Limp Bizkit tune, you're ripping off another station that played it?  He didn't write that.  I wonder if he's getting any calls from people saying, oh, now something happens live on your show and you find a website and put live video on it.  Something we've been doing for six years.  Oh, it would be bad.  But, you know, we don't jump on it and go, hoo-hoo, they're ripping us off.  But guaranteed, if he had spent the past six years putting video clips on a website and something happened in here and we had never done it before and something happened in here and we said, hey, go to a website. 
[00:04:30]  You know how many brainwashed moronic tools are called going, oh, now you're putting stuff on a website?  Be original.  We haven't.  Give it up.  But get your own life.  We're pretty much the first radio show in America that took advantage of the Internet in a big, bad way well over six years ago.  Don't, you know, get a life.  My God.  But go on the radio and make believe, you know, you came up with the term balloon on and all those other terms that have been floating around the Internet for probably ten years. 
[00:05:00]  We have a whole glossary of, you know, terms for body parts on one of our websites, foundrymusic.com.  It's been up there for years.  It's been passed around from office to office for many, many years.  And now he's going to make believe that, you know, this is a cool thing to do and he's going to come up with all his terms.  Yeah.  Let's be real here.  Donkey punch and all that crap.  That's that crap's been said for many years. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  So shut up, douchebag.  There you go.  Hey, welcome.  We're ripping someone off because we're playing a song that, oh, my God, maybe 100 to 200 stations across America are playing right now.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Get your own brain, for God's sake.  Anyway, Anthony, here we are.  Yeah.  For another fine radio program.  Nice. 
[00:06:00]  What, Ben?  That's right, Opie.  Tommy, what's going on?  You guys better stop biting off stern, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, okay.  No, Opie, you just coughed.  He coughed last Thursday.  I love you bastards.  All right.  Thanks, Tommy.  You know, we try not to play that game, but you guys force us from time to time.  Yeah.  You know, Howie knows where Balloon Knot came from and most of those terms he's been using on his show lately. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  So, please.  It had nothing to do with it.  So don't start, you know, calling other radio guys, including us, and saying that we're ripping him off.  Right.  Because we use the term Balloon Knot, something we've used for many years.  Yeah.  And Donkey Punch and all that crap.  You know, somebody actually wrote an email the other day and said that he was crediting celebrity golf tournaments. 
[00:07:00]  You know, where they take the cameras out, go to a golf course where celebrities are playing golf.  saying that he started that whole thing with the tennis match that he played with Gary many years ago.  And I'm reading it going, now, if that was said, that had to be a joke.  No one in their right mind could claim that they came up with the celebrity golf.  The celebrity idea.  The celebrity sports tournament concept. 
[00:07:30]  You know, be real.  Maybe he's God.  Maybe he invented everything.  Maybe.  Maybe he's going to show his true identity.  That's right.  Ooh.  Gets ridiculous after a while.  Tony, what's going on?  It was Howard and Eve.  Dude, I'll make this short and sweet.  Yeah, Tony.  All right.  The difference between you guys and Hook No Schmuck Boy over there is at least you guys have the balls to put even his stupid ass listeners on the air and let them say their piece.  We call there to call them out.  You know, it sounds like we have no life. 
[00:08:00]  Why would we do that?  But don't claim something for your own and then try to rag on us.  At least all my point is is you guys have the balls to put anybody on the air and let them say their piece.  Hey, we got to defend ourselves because, you know, when we come to work and we get hundreds and I mean hundreds of email from you guys saying, oh, my God, he's starting to use balloon on all the stuff, you know, we've been using on the show for three years.  Even longer, some of these terms, you know, we feel like we have to, you know, say something about it.  Right.  You know, you guys have talent, you're original and that's him. 
[00:08:30]  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Joe, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Just want to say, man, long time, die hard Stern fan.  But, you know, what's right is right, man.  You guys are right.  I mean, the guy, it convinced me the other day when I called up to ask him about this very stuff you're talking about, you know, because even though you guys do the same format, you guys have come up with a lot of good stuff, a lot of good, your own original stuff, which really no other DJs like Man Queer or any of those lame-os could ever do. 
[00:09:00]  Without a doubt.  And that's why we get really pissed off because we know we're original.  We know we do our own thing.  The one thing we've told just about everyone that has interviewed us lately is that, yeah, we're in the same genre as Howard, but we have done a lot of brand new things with our show.  I think the thing that it is about you guys is, number one, you're right there.  Number two, you're infinity and he just, you know, for building that company.  Yeah, he did build it, but it's like saying, like, nobody should have wrote rock and roll after Elvis did. 
[00:09:30]  He did create it.  He did take it a lot further, you know, than most people were doing, whether he just got it more famous at the time or what.  He had great entertaining radio over the years, but, you know, a lot of people are doing it now.  You know, fine, you created it, but he's lost it, man.  I mean, his energy is completely out the door.  You guys are doing stuff back from the early 90s when you had Billy West and he was great.  And that's the energy you've got now and he's lost it and can't find it again.  Joe, you're killing me because you didn't create it.  Well, I mean, no, not create the format. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, take it to where it is now, like what all the shows are doing.  He made it better, but he didn't create it.  No, not, okay.  We have a tape of, and we can pull it out today if you really need to hear this.  We have a tape of Scott Muni.  He worked at WNAW for literally 40 years.  I don't even know when he started.  We have a tape from like early 1970s of him having a stripper in the studio.  Taking her clothes off.  Yeah, but, you know, the stripper thing.  I'm just talking about, you know, the stream of consciousness type of show that a lot of people are doing. 
[00:10:30]  I'm not saying that they shouldn't be doing it.  And I'm not saying, you know, he invented it all, but, you know, he opened the doors for a lot of people.  You guys have said that, but he's too carried away with himself.  You know what I told Rolling Stone when they interviewed us?  It's coming out in a few weeks.  Yeah.  And I hope they print this because they asked us about the whole Howard thing and the imitators and all that crap.  I go, could you imagine if John Lennon was alive today and him walking around just telling all the bands that are out today that they're all ripping him off?  He would look like quite an idiot. 
[00:11:00]  How ridiculous John Lennon would look?  Yeah, that gets old after.  I mean, you know, maybe, you know, I mean, it's just he's the only thing he's ever clutched to, and it's always seemed to work,  but you guys are just as truthful as he used to be, and now he's threatened, you know?  Well, hundreds and hundreds of e-mail today about, you know, how we're doing this glossary of terms thing.  Yeah.  Something we've been doing forever.  Yeah, I know.  I think he's just poking back at you guys like in a roundabout kind of way, trying to piss you off.  Could be.  Whatever.  You know. 
[00:11:30]  We're here, and we're not going anywhere.  I know.  Hey, hats off to you guys.  You don't back down on an inch.  That's why I respect you.  I think you're doing a good job.  Joe, I say it all the time.  We always win in the end.  All right, man.  Another example of that, we got opiananthony.com back.  Yep.  That's it.  Remember the douchebag that stole opiananthony.com, our website?  Yeah, try to put some stuff on there.  He made it into an anti-Opiananthony site.  How are this?  How are that?  Douchebag was like, you know, trying to hold us hostage. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Wanted thousands and thousands of dollars.  Well, there's another person that lost, and we win in the end.  We got opiananthony.com back.  It was a pain in the ass, but we did it.  Douche.  Count how many times I say douchebag today.  Nick.  Yo.  What's up?  How you doing?  All right.  No, this whole Stern thing, I got to put the comment in.  First off, Stern's a has-been, and he knows it.  Just the other day, he proved that when he had his little incident on his show, and he's 
[00:12:30]  talking about his website, and he didn't even know he had a website.  You know?  And he's going to sit there, you know, and everyone's going to say, oh, Stern this, Stern that.  You know?  F. Stern, you guys are fresh.  You're new.  You're funny as well.  Just wait for this one to come out, how, you know, now every DJ has a website because  of me.  Oh, yeah.  Every DJ is now putting video clips on the website because of me.  Right.  Exactly.  And you know you're going to hear that.  It's bull because he knows him right well. 
[00:13:00]  I mean, you guys pull one hell of a base.  I'm down here in South Jersey.  You've got one hell of a base building.  I just want you to know, man, if anything, he's biting off of you.  So keep plugging, man.  All right.  We've been putting stuff on our website from our show for, like Anne said, six or seven  years now.  So whatever you want to do, that's fine.  Like now, if you want us to put stuff on the website, you know, that's great.  Fine.  But then to turn around and start saying, you know, I started this.  Because then you get the few real mutants that actually believe that crap. 
[00:13:30]  You know, they actually buy it.  Oh.  All right, Nick.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  That's funny.  Okay.  Terrific.  Look at that.  Look how.  All right.  I'll put a couple of idiots through because we're not.  We're not afraid like other shows.  Yes, Rich.  Go ahead.  Say your stupid comment.  No, no.  Why?  See?  Why are you jumping down my throat already? 
[00:14:00]  Go ahead.  Because it's stupid.  No, no.  It's not stupid.  I'm just saying.  Go ahead.  All these guys that call up right now and say, F Howard, F this, that.  I mean, come on.  That's not what we're trying to do here.  We are trying to protect our show and what we do.  You guys are great.  You guys are original.  What we do every afternoon from three to seven.  Right.  You guys are original.  I like you guys.  Listen to Howard.  Listen to you guys.  I mean, Howard doesn't talk about you guys.  You guys shouldn't waste your time talking about him.  No, because he's the bigger fish. 
[00:14:30]  And, you know, this is.  He is a bigger fish.  Let me tell you why we bring him up from time to time.  I'll tell you.  Because there's been a bunch of guys in Ant and I's position where Howard crushed because  they didn't freaking fight.  And he does talk about us in terms of saying things like my clones, my copycats.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  Yeah.  So, you know something?  The fact that he doesn't mention our names just shows you who is a pussy.  You guys are.  Come on.  Rich, I'll tell you this.  There's been a bunch of pussies that came before us that laid down and died. 
[00:15:00]  And you know what?  We're not going to do it.  I agree.  You think the company's really happy right now because we're doing this?  No.  But we know it has to be done to, you know, protect our show and what we do.  So, F for everybody.  All right.  Behind all the media and everything, how do you guys really feel about Howard?  I mean, his show.  I don't really give a flying F about him.  If it wasn't for him, you guys wouldn't have your show.  That's not true.  It is true.  He does his thing and we do our thing.  I know.  But if it wasn't for him, it's the door. 
[00:15:30]  It's the media and it's the listeners that are trying to stir up a battle.  We don't care.  We just don't want to be called imitators and all that crap.  So, we defend ourselves.  You guys are original.  But, I mean, Howard's got a good show.  You guys got a good show.  I love to see you guys go in the mornings and compete.  And then all you guys are recording and say, Howard sucks.  Who's the real fans?  Howard?  And the funny thing is, you know, these idiots, you know, that want to jump down our throat,  they don't remember the good things we have said in the last three years. 
[00:16:00]  That's right.  One of them being that, you know, the company's completely insane for not having Howard on  every freaking, you know, talk station that we're on.  Yes.  It started in New York.  The New York station, you know, our morning show, they're trying real hard, but they're  still not doing much of anything.  And I said it a real long time ago, that if you're trying to do an extreme talk radio  station, it's stupid not to have Howard in the morning, and then you build from there.  There you go.  But, you know, people don't remember all that stuff. 
[00:16:30]  And we don't spend that much time on it.  Because now we're going to move on with our show.  Who, who, who?  See, there's a million people.  And you know what?  We said what we had to say, and we'll, we'll, there you go.  Because whenever it pops up, it has to be, um, uh, we have to comment on it.  There you go.  If it gets a little out of hand, we got to keep people in check.  Give them a reality check.  That's all.  Hey, Fred, you're next on, uh, Opie and Anthony.  You know, I've listened to Howard, too.  You guys are just so real, and he's so scripted. 
[00:17:00]  I don't even know how he can, I mean, is everybody a copy of Adam and Eve?  I mean, well, what the hell's going on with this guy?  He lost his identity completely with the divorce.  And I think that's what's troubling him the most.  He's searching for a new identity.  He sees what's happening.  And, uh, he's not stupid.  He sees.  There you go.  You guys are the kickers.  There you go.  So he'll bite off us a little bit, and then, uh, you know, yell how everyone's ripped  him off.  It's so obvious.  And he's just so bland now.  It's not the same as it was.  All right, Fred, thank you. 
[00:17:30]  We could do this forever.  So let's move on, Anthony, okay?  Yeah.  We have a good show today.  Man, we've had some bang-up, uh, programs this week.  The party atmosphere.  It's weird.  It's almost lonely in here today.  No, we got a lot of people coming in.  Yeah, I know.  Uh, we got Lounge Against the Machine in studio today.  Uh, we have, uh, Frank Caliendo in studio today.  The guy that does the great John Madden and many other people.  Yes.  And, uh, much, much more.  We got, uh, two days left to qualify for our Man Boob contest, Anthony. 
[00:18:00]  Anthony had some, uh, some good contestants in yesterday.  It was the guy with the Asian woman breasts.  Did you see that on the website?  Yeah.  It's pretty scary.  Yeah, it looks like a chick.  So, guys, if you think you can beat what's up on the website, you got, uh, you know, today  or tomorrow during the show to come down and show us what you got, okay?  Right.  We're going to expand these, uh, contests to all the other cities very, very soon.  But, yeah, we have to work, we have to work out the details.  So, unfortunately, you know, to qualify, you got to come down to our studio in New York, 
[00:18:30]  all right?  Yes.  And for fuller hair, a thinner body, and a fresher look, see Dr. Gregory Pistone.  He's helping us out with this contest because he's going to fix, uh, one of these guys,  uh, man boobs and make it look, uh, look at, make it look good and natural, okay?  He's got a website.  The guy's out of Philadelphia, www.drpistone.com.  That's P-I-S-T-O-N-E.  Also sponsoring this is goldenpalace.com.  When you vote on the man boobs, you'll have a chance to enter for a trip to Hedonism 3.

The top shot of, uh, contestant six, Brian, the above shot is just, he's got the pointy,  big boobs.  But they all have really bad breasts.  The guy with the Asian boobs, though, that's really disturbing, man.  Yeah, because he's not a fat guy.  No, and he's got just little banana boobs. 
[00:19:30]  It's just...  All right, so come down for that.  And, and more.  I wanted to play the Garrett Moore's clip.  Ben, can we find that real fast?  Well, we might not even have time because we wasted, wasted showtime on crap.  Crap!  Want to play the Garrett Moore's from the other day?  Is it him singing?  Yeah, it's, uh, we had Garrett Moore's from SNL in.  Oh, that's the long version.  He was out of his mind.  The Garrett Moore's?  Garrett Moore's?  Yeah.  Um.  Oh.

Hey, you can bring that.  Did she call you out?  Yeah, but I never called her back.  What did she say?  I never called her back.  You can't find it.  All right, we'll just take a break.  We'll figure it out.  Stay there.  What country are you from?  Uh, what?  What ain't no country I haven't heard of.  They speak English and what?  Uh, what?

Yeah, otherwise you could just measure him and see who has the biggest boobs.  Yeah, no.  No.  Well, the winner's going to get a free procedure from Dr. Gregory Pistone.  I guess he does wonders.  Yeah.  Which guy could benefit the most?  All right, guys.  And in my opinion, it's not necessarily the fat guys. 
[00:23:00]  Sometimes I think the fat guys are some of the worst.  I got to go.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Jay.  They're just going to get rid of their man-boobs, and you're not even going to notice because  they're going to have the big gut and the rest of the fat around them.  But if, like, the one guy with the little Asian boobs.  I mean, hello.  Who saw that coming when he took his shirt off?  You know what I'm saying?  All of a sudden, he had very little breasts.  I think it's very important to vote for the guy that you would think would benefit the 
[00:23:30]  most from having this procedure done.  Yeah.  If you think it's the fat guys, then go for it.  There's no problem.  I would ask my page.  All right, call him up and we'll talk to the guy and smooth things over.  I'll smooth it over.  Watch me in action.  I am the diplomat.  You could, you know, ask how she's feeling and stuff today.  Yeah.  And how it went.  I'll be nice.  Try to get him on the air.  If not, we'll just do the one-sided conversation thing, okay?  Guaranteed, we'll get her to call back and do the same goddamn thing.  No, here, Ant.  Just give it right to Anthony. 
[00:24:00]  Ah, that's a recording.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, well.  Maybe later.  Well, Rick, leave the message and say you're returning the call.  See, now you can be brave because you know it's an answer machine.  Give them the hotline number.  Leave the hotline number.  Hey, are these guys ready outside?  Um, not yet.  Not yet?  Okay.  Not yet.  You hear that? 
[00:24:30]  All right.  We got like a, you know, a band today.  Yeah.  Got a band on the show.  Uh, Lounge Against the Machine.  They're going to hang out and like, you know, play some stuff as we go in and out of breaks  and stuff.  Uh, we've played a lot of their tracks on the show already.  They do, um, very different versions of, uh, a lot of popular songs.  Mm-hmm.  Like Nine Inch Nails, Closer, uh, Bullet to Blue Sky from U2, Creep from Radiohead, Rape  Me from Nirvana.  It's really, really funny.  Haunting.  Smack My Bitch Up, uh, they do some Rage Against the Machine, Suck My Kiss. 
[00:25:00]  Looking forward to hearing it.  Matter of fact, here, I'll just give you a taste because these guys are, um, getting  set to play today.  Whistling  Then we got to talk about the Call Me Now lady.  Yeah.  Miss Cleo.  Lounge Against the Machine.  Yeah.  A little taste.  Here's one for the ladies.  Rape me. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Rape me, my friend.  Come on, rape me.  Rape me again.  I'm not the only one.  No, uh, uh, uh, I'm not the only one.  Hate me.  Do it and do it again.  Waste me. 
[00:26:00]  Got a big stand-up bass out there and everything.  Yeah.  Hate me, my friend.  I'm not the only one.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  But I'm not the only one.  My favorite inside stores.  I'll kick your open doors.  Thank you.  Appreciate your concern.  You always stick and burn. 
[00:26:30]  Rape me.  Yeah.  Rape me, my friend.  Ow.  Rape me.  Rape me again.  Everybody!  Rape me!  Put your hands together!  Rape me again!  R-A-P-E! 
[00:27:00]  Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, me!  Rock!  There you go.  Lounge Against the Machine.  Rape me.  Where do these guys play?  Uh, we'll ask them.  You want to talk to the lead singer?  Get the lead singer in here, Stink.  What do they do?  Where is he?  Hey!  Hey, what's up, man?  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  You're the lead singer?  Nice voice there.  Yeah, Richard Cheese. 
[00:27:30]  Thank you so much for having me in.  Richard Cheese.  Can I just say I love you guys?  Yes, Richard Cheese.  Very funny.  He looks like Kevin Meaney a little bit.  Yes, I feel like Kevin Meaney.  Yeah, anyone tell you that before?  No.  No?  No.  Kevin Meaney's wife.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  Seriously, we just got here and we were listening to the show.  What is it, the balloon knot?  Hey.  Hey, you like that?  Seriously, you guys made that up.  I've known that for you.  That's where I stole it from.  That old gag.  There you have it.  So what's up, Richard Cheese?  We are in town for a big show Friday night at the Mercury Lounge and we are honored to 
[00:28:00]  be here.  Seriously.  Cool.  We're big shots being on the opening of the day show.  Where do you guys play?  We're playing, we play at the House of Blues in Los Angeles.  We're on tour right now.  We just played a big festival show in Philadelphia.  We're playing in Baltimore this Sunday and Vegas in August.  Vegas.  Now that's got to be a thrill, right?  We've got to get these guys to one of our road shows.  We would love it.  We do some crazy things at our road shows, man.  What do you wear out there in Vegas?  Tuxedo.  You're going to have the whole thing.  Yeah, we've got the whole band.  We all wear ties.  Tuxes. 
[00:28:30]  I wear a tux for the opening part of the show and then I put on the big tiger skin number  at the end.  It's pretty slick.  Oh, sort of a, what is that, Siegfried and Roy look?  Yeah, without the gay part.  Without the gay part.  Yeah.  Just like Siegfried and Roy.  Hard to do.  Hard to do with the Siegfried and Roy thing.  So what songs do you guys want to do today?  Well, we are ready to play almost anything.  We played probably half the album on the show, right?  That's very kind.  We have a bunch of new stuff, too.  I want to hear something newer.  Maybe Hashpipe?  You do Hashpipe?  Hashpipe's one of our numbers.  That'd be good.  One of your numbers?  Yeah.  One of the numbers that we pull.  That's good. 
[00:29:00]  You know, it's all about the great songs that the kids are listening to today.  These are timeless classics.  Right.  You know, some of the best songs are being written right now and we're very lucky.  What are some of the newer ones that we haven't heard about?  Well, we do Slim Shady by the Eminem.  He's good.  And we've got, let's see here.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, the Thong song?  Sorry to interrupt you.  The naked cowboy.  Why is the naked cowboy here?  What is he doing here?  He's not naked, is he?  Well, he's probably in his underwear.  Why is he here? 
[00:29:30]  He was upstairs.  Oh, we were talking about this guy yesterday.  Richard Cheese.  What?  I think you're talking about him yesterday.  That's probably why he's here.  This is a guy, Richard Cheese, in Times Square, here in the heart of New York City.  He goes around with a cowboy hat and tighty-whities and boots and plays his guitar.  And I guess people throw money at him.  Wow.  Yeah.  Can we get him for an opener?  You know, you might want to talk with him.  Wow.  I don't think his music's that good. 
[00:30:00]  That's why he has to do this.  And he sells all kinds of merchandise on his website.  You want to bring him in?  You could, uh...  You want to humor us, Richard, and...  Yeah, anytime, baby.  Just go with this?  All right.  I have all day.  Bring in the naked cowboy, because he's not going to be here too long.  Well, I'm the naked cowboy coming to a town near you.  Well, I'm the naked cowboy coming to a town near you.  Yes, he's in his tighty-whities.  What's up, guys?  In his cowboy hat. 
[00:30:30]  And you're...  We were talking about you yesterday, and now you're here today.  Yeah, I have a huge email list of people who have emailed me at nakedcowboy.com.  And, of course, when I'm on any radio, TV ad, whether it be in the United States or abroad...  Yeah, right.  ...and I get tipped off, and then I follow up.  What happened?  But where did you get to the point where you had to put on your underwear and your cowboy hat and boots and go out into Times Square?  Well, actually, I've been arrested 43 times in 42 states outside of New York City, so I go everywhere. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah?  Times Square is just where I've been settling on, because I've been doing, literally...  I mean, I did a Japanese film documentary just the other day on the world's most amazing people that will air on global Japan.  I've done that for South Korea, Germany.  I mean, I'm on TV and radio every day in the world right here.  Eight hours a day.  Rick, why don't you take pictures of the naked cowboy?  If you really want to live and feel the way I feel...  All right.  You've got to whip out your balls of steel. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  See, they all must have that naked theme running through them, I guess.  I've got a whole big group of love songs.  Now, how long have you been trying to make it in the music business?  I'm not going to be a musician.  I am going to be the most celebrated entertainer of all time doing major, for the most part, TV.  Oh, really?  Making brief appearances.  Yes, I am.  You're wearing briefs right now.  We'll celebrate entertainer of all time.  Yeah, he's got his briefs on.  Two pairs of all time.  I'm wearing twice as much as a big-time wrestler.  I think you should have maybe, you know, stuffed him a little bit there.  No, no. 
[00:32:00]  What?  What?  With two socks?  The homophobes say I'm a queer, but I like chicks and beer.  Everywhere I swing my ass in my cowboy gear.  The homophobes say I'm a queer, but I like chicks and beer.  I like chicks and beer.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  There's the naked cowboy.  How many times a day does someone try to punch you when you're hanging out in Times Square? 
[00:32:30]  I have maybe one person out of a whole day that will even say something like...  I'm not even going to lie to you.  We all walked by yesterday, and the girls were just losing their ass,  and the boyfriends were all getting pissed off and stuff because they were getting pictures with you.  I guess the girls like you.  They hate you when you're beautiful.  Oh, that must be it, right?  I don't think.  Sure, sure.  It just kind of looks ridiculous, right, Frank Caliendo?  Times Square is where people come to see this strung out, total idiot who's still trying... 
[00:33:00]  And this is the epitome of all of it.  I got the...  You're pretty much all that's left, though.  ...thetic image.  You're all that's left in Times Square, to tell you the truth.  We were talking about that yesterday, too.  They all left when they saw me.  You'd turn down a street corner, you'd see oral favors being given out by a dumpster years ago,  and Giuliani cleaned the whole thing up,  but now you're pretty much the only naked thing in Times Square.  Well, again, it's the Reds' trademark.  It's beautiful.  No one can top it.  It's just...  Do you play anywhere besides Times Square?  Do you get to... 
[00:33:30]  I've been leading all the nation's national parades.  I'm now the Cincinnati Reds' mascot by simply running out in the field with a ball glove.  I'm getting arrested there, and I've gotten arrested in five other ball fields,  Comiskey, Wrigley, and now I get arrested just for being there.  I just go in...  Oh, really?  I just switch real quick, and they'll show me on ESPN.  I mean, like, I have a commercial for ESPN that I'm not...  You know, I had nothing to do with it.  Naked Cowboy, Richard T. is here asking you a question.  Have you ever gotten paid for anything ever?  That's the whole... 
[00:34:00]  That's where you need to turn the corner.  You know what I'm saying?  For two and a half years, I've been paying.  I've worked as a waiter at TGI Fridays to do all the birthdays.  So you have a job job.  Yeah, I was doing that.  Two and a half...  Well, about 27 days.  I got a book I'm writing.  TGI Fridays.  Of course.  You can read the book already at NakedCowboy.com.  Again, that's another book, The Legend of the Naked Cowboy.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, but...  Naked Cowboy, you have very pretty eyes.  Thank you very much.  About 21 days ago, someone tried to give me a $5 bill on Times Square, which I never take  money.  Oh, you don't take money? 
[00:34:30]  Well, they always...  How do you make your money, then?  Well, listen, I was paying for this stuff myself.  That's my point.  Somebody tried to give me a $5, and I was like, all right, I took the $5.  And then I went ahead and took the $1.  I had like $48.  The next day, I wrote tips on the side of my boots, as you see.  And now, I'm making like $600 to $800 in an eight-hour shift every day.  Where do you keep the money?  And I'm getting on TV.  No one can tell.  Obviously, not in the front of his boots.  I put them all on my boots.  You make $600 a day.  I made $800 on Saturday last week.  The week before.  $800. 
[00:35:00]  In one day.  And every single dollar represents...  Well, there's nine that stiffed me out of that.  And every single one that's there is...  You know, they're taking home a picture of me with a big smile on the face.  Well, there you go.  You know, again, my website on my guitar.  And that's something, you know, people can take home to Oklahoma with them when they...  To Spain, to Europe, wherever.  Wherever, right.  This show has changed, hasn't it, Frank Caliando?  The first time I was in here, there was an ass contest.  Yeah.  There were boob things. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  And now, there's a naked cowboy next to me.  Yeah.  Well, we knew you were coming in, so we got a naked man.  Does John Mann have a comment about the naked cowboy?  I always put him on the spot.  Hey, that's an interesting setup there.  You got a cowboy here, and he's got his briefs on, and Frank said he had pretty eyes.  I'm referring to him as if I'm not even Frank, so people won't know who I am.  He's got a naked cowboy hat, and there's a picture of Jesus on his arm. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And a picture of the devil.  Hey, this guy's got both sides.  It's like the cartoon there.  You got Jesus on one arm and the devil on the other.  And I'm right in the middle.  And you're right in the middle.  He's trying to figure it all out.  Oh, wow.  I get it.  Now I know why the girls take the pictures with him.  Why?  Listen to him.  I'm like, I'm right in the middle.  I know.  He's trying to figure it all out.  If you're help, darling, I think we'll be able to.  He's doing the Lord's work in the devil's city. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  Hey, Gay Marco.  Hey, I'm here.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, Gay Marco?  This guy sounds like he's a hottie.  What brand of underwear does he wear?  I'm now accepting corporate sponsors, and I am looking for an underwear sponsor.  But you're not plugging what you're wearing now.  I wear my own brand, and I made it myself that I paint.  You can buy them online.  They're called skid marks.  Ew.  You're selling your underwear.  I sell underwear, yes.  Naked Cowboy, same thing, at the website.  Of course.  Of course.  Skid marks, boots, hats, underwear, there's six CDs for the songs you can download for  free. 
[00:37:00]  His underwear looks like a shoeshine rack.  Great.  I need to learn how to merchandise through this guy.  See?  This is good.  Well, I am the world's best.  Marco.  Yes?  What are you wearing?  He wants to know.  The trademark actually consists of two pairs of underwear.  Boots and hat.  Marco.  It gets more ridiculous by now.  Have you seen this picture up on the website?  No, I have to go check it out.  I can't wait to go home.  Oh, my God.  This guy's going to release batch after batch.  Is he cute? 
[00:37:30]  What would you rate him as?  We're not rating a man for a gay guy.  Oh, come on, Anthony.  What would you say?  I'm missing a homo by proxy.  I have no problem with it.  Eight.  Frank Caliando gives him an eight and a half.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't have Madonna.  Rick's wife's saying ten.  Oh, my God.  Rick's wife.  Let's get a couple of girls' point of view here.  Naked Cowboy.  Ladies, how would you rate the Naked Cowboy?  Definitely a ten.  Definitely a ten?  Thank you very much. 
[00:38:00]  What about you?  What do you think?  Yeah, he's hot.  What would you rate him?  One to ten?  Ten.  You give him a ten.  Is he packing anything?  Looks like it, yeah.  He's got some going on.  I'm wearing two pairs of briefs, ladies.  Hey, Superman didn't have, like, this huge ball.  I mean, you keep that down.  It's not a parley act.  It's a family act.  You see the two girls smile.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Perfect.  Oh, oh, oh.  Why are you wearing two?  Oh.  To make it more family friendly.  I was arrested in Indianapolis.  They said if they could see the imprint of your genitalia. 
[00:38:30]  Of course, I cover myself with a guitar, so that wasn't really the issue.  But just to make it more, you know, I mean, I'm not trying to show anything like that.  But you could see me in Playgirl May of 98.  Oh.  May 98.  Playgirl.  Well, go pick that one up, Marco.  Back when I did that cheap work and I was selling out.  Rick's wife's a little smitten right now.  There's still a place to go.  Why don't you give him a big hug, Linda, and then tell him that cowboy thing's really  working for me.  What a great call back from yesterday's show. 
[00:39:00]  Naked Cowboy, could you hug Linda, please?  Yes, come over here, please.  Take the guitar off, so.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Look at that.  She's going to need a shower now.  You speak Spanish?  Un poquito.  Okay, Marco.  Yeah?  You want to come down and get hugged by the Naked Cowboy?  I would love to.  Where is he performing at?  I'm going to go check him out.  Times Square.  Do you like the gay guys checking you out, Naked Cowboy?  It doesn't matter to me one way or the other.  That's who it is.  I know.  I know that Rick's wife has excellent taste. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Yes, Frank?  Ricky Martin.  That's who he looks like with long hair.  Really?  Ricky Martin's not nearly as good looking as me.  Please.  That's who he looks like to me.  I'm sorry.  The Naked Cowboy.  He's very full of himself.  What's the matter, Ben?  I'm not living on a dry chicken breast and mixed vegetables for nothing.  In fact, this is one of the guys we both yesterday said, what a tool this guy is.  You man, Stinky.  As we walk by.  There he goes, Ben.  Thanks for your honesty, guys.  That's what I'm shooting for, man.  Well, it's not like we're going to look at you and go, ugh.  Wow.  Yum.  The Naked Cowboy. 
[00:40:00]  How's that for a topper?  Oh.  Oh.  Tulsa Nelson Riley loves the Naked Cowboy.  Oh.  How's that for a topper?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You guys are actually funny.  I do radio stations every day.  Oh.  You're like, nobody's even funny.  You guys are funny.  Really?  Well, we like to.  I feel like I have to stop.  All right.  Don't.  Nah.  We just have a lot of fun in here.  Sure.  Don't suck up to us.  Oh, boy.  Is that beer you're all drinking?  Hey, what did the email say that you read today?  Today?  Yeah.  We trashed you yesterday.  Oh, no, no.  Everybody was real positive. 
[00:40:30]  No way.  We're our listeners positive.  They got a hold of the Naked Cowboy.  Well, I mean, how many people would say if a million people went home and looked at  your website, how many would email you?  Maybe.  Right.  Out of a million, I bet it would be something like ten.  All right.  Give us a little more music here.  Yo soy rancaro desnudo viendo si no da se que de usted.  Yo soy rancaro desnudo viendo si no da se que de usted.  I do all my songs in Spanish as well.  Well, you're multicultural there, because it is New York City, so.  Well, tell me why you're standing there looking at me. 
[00:41:00]  Why suck in one language?  Like you've never seen a man half naked strumming wild and free.  Well, if you don't stop looking at me, I'm going to bend your ass over my knee.  Uh-oh.  You're going to bitch, scream, holler, and swear as you get your ass kicked by a man  in his underwear.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to be kicking some ass, huh?  This is my intimidation. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, that one scared me.  Ooh, I'm pretty frightened right about now.  Uh-oh.  Sandy.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  I was hoping that the Naked Cowboy would still be there for a while.  Oh, Sandy, are you planning on coming down?  I'm around the corner.  Naked Cowboy, would you like to do my girlfriend?  Oh, Jesus.  We'll keep him here for you, Sandy.  I don't have enough information to wish to base a fact.  I'm clean.  She's hot.  Wow.  Yeah, I'll let you bang my girlfriend.  What the hell?  Yeah, you'll let the Naked Cowboy...  Where are you? 
[00:42:00]  You get a lot of action out there on the street?  I've had one girlfriend for the last six years who's been away for now like 30 days,  so we're not saying...  30 days?  Is that a jail stint?  Pardon?  Is that from a jail stint?  30 days?  Usually when you have to say 30, 90, 60 days...  We went to a party.  She was going as a Naked Cowgirl.  You can see her on the site as well.  I had her in her underwear and starting to do this with me.  Well, now the website's going to get found.  Yeah?  So you've got the Naked Cowgirl on your website?  I do have her on there, but she exists as a separate entity, which I can't speak about. 
[00:42:30]  Uh-oh.  Who knew there's probably some big corporate problems or something?  Hey, when she tried to get NakedCowgirl.com, it was already taken.  So somebody, you know, some people read it.  Somebody saw it coming.  Anything with naked and girl is taken.  You could put naked leprosy girl and it's taken and it's a porn site.  All right?  Anything with naked girl, taken.  Heather, what's going on?  I think that Naked Cowboy is a 10, definitely.  Oh, why?  You went to his website? 
[00:43:00]  Yes.  You checked him out?  He has beautiful hair, too.  Very nice.  Suave.  All right.  A little more music there, Naked Cowboy.  Go ahead.  Give us a second.  Yeah, what the hell?  Man, you got me on that slump.  Baby, I'm crazy about the things you do.  And I can't imagine any life without you. 
[00:43:30]  Baby, I'm crazy about the things you do.  And I can't imagine any life without you.  Hey, Naked Cowboy.  There he is.  The naked cowgirl.  He speaks from the heart.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucks ass.  All right.  Where's the Naked Cowgirl picture, though?  It should be in the gallery. 
[00:44:00]  Photo gallery.  All right.  I just don't want to click on the Naked Cowboy picture gallery if I'm not going to get the  Naked Cowgirl.  You know what I mean?  I thought he browsed it twice.  You know what I mean?  That's a mister.  Let's hit.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, Naked Cowboy rules.  He's cracking me up here.  You like the Naked Cowboy?  Yeah.  He should go on tour with those other guys.  Which other guys?  The Lounge Against the Machine guys?  Yeah, Lounge Against the Machine.  They should tour together.  That'd be great.  Yeah, I think the Naked Cowboy might be a little too big for us.  We can't have that kind of stadium tour at this point. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  There you go.  Absolutely.  Naked Cowboy, do girls just grab at your junk in the middle of Times Square and stuff?  No, no, no.  Haven't had anyone goose you or something as they're walking back?  100% respect.  Really?  Any parents horrified that they have to bring their small children past you or anything?  Again, look through that gallery.  I mean, I take pictures with kids all day long.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Yeah.  All day, all night, and private.  And I have a kid's underwear line called Switcheroos. 
[00:45:00]  Switcheroos.  Uh-oh.  From going into the stadiums and switching into them.  Okay, terrific.  Switcheroos.  For the kids.  For the kids.  Get them started.  Underroads is a huge market.  It goes from there to your little, you know, figure.  Guys, girls, switcheroos.  What?  I don't care.  What I don't get is you have the head.  You have the hat and the underwear.  Shouldn't you be like the semi-naked cowboy?  Right.  Naked is just a metaphor for how to do it.  Hey, look, look.  Oh, is that it?  This is naked for me, man.  Am I breaking it down too much? 
[00:45:30]  Let's relax over there.  Seminakedcowboy.com was taken.  That's why you wanted to make this.  Yeah, it's okay that naked cowboy's still wearing some clothes.  Okay?  In order for the trade.  If you want the real naked cowboy, we can set up another room for you, my friend.  I might be up for that.  Joey, what's up?  Joey!  Hello.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Hey.  Now he's got to listen to himself.  What a soul. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  We got to the part where he said you guys suck and we're like, yeah.  All right.  We should take a break.  Half of the naked cowgirl is up now.  It's scrolling very slowly.  I think your website's being slammed.  And she looks very attractive.  All right.  She's in her little red, white, and blue little bikini top.  Richard Cheese?  Yes, sir.  Very hard to say.  What do you think?  She looks okay.  I can only see her from the neck up.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to say.  I need to see the rest.  Nice guns.  We'll get the rest, yeah.  All right.  Well, we got the naked cowboy in the studio. 
[00:46:30]  Frank Caliendo.  Are you plugging something?  Yeah.  Where are you going to be?  No, it's cool.  Naked cowboy.  He's going to be.  Hey.  I Ted Knighted it.  Naked cowboy.  Oh, no.  Spalding.  I want you with a golf course in five minutes.  Chop, chop.  Come on.  Come on in.  We got to go back and forth.  Did you hear the one about the colored boy?  No.  Go ahead.  No, I heard that one. 
[00:47:00]  That's a hoot.  Wait a second.  You be Ted Knight.  Wait.  Wait.  I almost said the wrong word.  You screw.  I screwed up.  Who screwed up?  I did.  Okay.  Huh?  You be Ted Baxter.  I'll be the guy from Too Close for Comfort.  Easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat.  But the man that's worthwhile is the man that could smile when his shorts are too tight  in the seat.  Okay.  Okay, Pookie, Chris, and the boat.  Wait a second.  I think Monroe wants to see the cowboy. 
[00:47:30]  Monroe.  Naked cowboy.  Here.  Now.  Lou.  Lou.  Lou.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  Thanks, Mary.  Lou.  I do an impression of Captain Steubing.  Oh, yeah?  Nice.  We're doing 70s TV show.  This is big.  You ready?  Are you ready?  This is Richard Cheese.  Go ahead.  Go for it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nice.  I'm no Frank, but I'm getting there.  That was awesome, man. 
[00:48:00]  Thank you.  Well, that works.  All right.  And the naked cowboy.  So, you guys got a good actor.  Oh, we just hang on.  It's pretty cool.  So, naked cowboy there.  You never do any gay things there, huh?  No, sir.  You never do any gay stuff.  Norm MacDonald in the studio.  Yeah, I got it.  Hey, the naked cowboy's got his package about a foot away from me there.  That makes me think it's pretty close to gay, you know?  Hey, you ever had Times Square?  You ever get one of those crack whores over there?  They're pretty funny, you know? 
[00:48:30]  Let's go back to me.  Crack whore.  That's funny.  Go to break, would you?  All right.  Where are you playing, though, Frank?  Rascals.  Rascals.  Okay.  Ocean on tomorrow and West Orange on Saturday.  Okay, good.  And, of course, we got Richard Cheese and the gang from Lounge Against the Machine.  We're going to hear some of his stuff as well.  And you can see the naked cowboy out there in Times Square or go to nakedcowboy.com.  There you go.  Thank you very much, guys.  No problem.  Yeah, this is Slash from Slash the Snake Pit, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony, and 
[00:49:00]  that's your problem.  One-oh-two-two-seven-seven.  The WNEW is the sports guys at 5 a.m., the radio chick at 9, Ron and Fez at noon, Opie and  Anthony at 3, Ron and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special, Ron and Fez.  It's Fez's first time.  So, Fez, how was your first time doing it?  It was great, Ron.  I was sweating, nervous, and my heart was pounding, but I loved it.  Good for you.  How long did it last?  Like a lot of guys, their first time, only a couple minutes, but it was worth it.  I never knew it could be this good. 
[00:49:30]  I've never seen anybody this excited about reading.  Hey, I just followed the sentences.  The book did most of the work.  All on the next Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3, 1027.  WNEW.  Anthony, O2Go.  I'm drinking the O2Go today.  It's the distilled water thing, right?  Yes, it's distilled and oxygenated.  Most distilled water tastes like crap.  Simple as that.  The O2Go, it tastes like regular water.  See, we talked to the guy.  He said, distilled water, very good for you, but tastes like crap. 
[00:50:00]  So they oxygenated it, and it's got eight times the oxygen of normal water.  Oxygen, very good for human beings, I hear.  I hear it's almost vital.  Yeah.  You can't get away from the O2.  You've got to love O2, the oxygen.  We call it O2.  We're buddy with oxygen.  And it does a bunch of things.  It'll help increase your stamina, your stammer.  It'll help keep you focused.  Did you ever do that where you start saying the wrong word the wrong way? 
[00:50:30]  You start saying the wrong word, O2, O-T, O-T, O-T.  Then you just make a joke about it.  O2Go, it's oxygenated water.  Check it out.  Get it.  It beats the rest of the water out there.  O2Go.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York. 
[00:51:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stained doing Fade.  Love the new CD from Stained.  Rob from Philly has something about the band.  Rob, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  It's a show Tuesday in Philly for the Electric Factory.  Guitar and the bass player had wow stickers on their instruments.  They had wow stickers on their instruments?  Yep, the red fender that Mike plays in the band blatantly right on their black sticker with 
[00:51:30]  the yellow laddering on it.  I don't know if it was yours or why it's P's.  That is really, really cool.  There you go.  Yeah.  You can clearly see the stickers and the girls around them.  Right.  Considering it's like five or six broads at Aaron Lewis.  I mean...  Yes.  Well, I hear Whippin' Mouth Wednesday is starting to happen in Philly.  I have.  I've gotten full Whippin' Mouth Wednesdays already.  It's been sweet.  Yeah, give it a few more weeks and it'll really start kicking in, all right?  Yep.  I would love to get Stained on this damn radio show.  Oh, that would be cool. 
[00:52:00]  We opened up for him.  Oh, the...  We did.  Did he really?  Yeah, we opened up for Stained at a show in Indianapolis.  The guy's bald.  Yes, he is.  Who knew?  I don't know if he's bald, though.  I think he's just keeping it short.  I don't know, no, I think he's seriously...  Shaving it, keeping it tight?  Chemo.  Chemo.  I don't know if I should believe the guy.  Probably not.  I've already had a drink, so don't listen to anything else.  All right, that's Richard Cheese from Lounge Against the Machine.  They're going to be our house band today, Anthony.  I feel like we're Conan or something. 
[00:52:30]  Letterman, we got a band now.  And Frank Caliendo in here as well.  Dan from Hoboken checking in saying,  I just made reservations for Frank at Rascals in Ocean Township,  and he better be funny.  Brian Regan funny, not Jeff Norris funny.  Now Dan from Hoboken getting on the Jeff Norris bashing.  Nice.  Tom, what's going on?  Yeah, did you guys say something about Richard Cheese was going to do a Weezer cover?  Yeah, baby.  We're going to do a hash pipe.  Nice.  You want us to do it now?  Nice.  Sounds good.  They're ready to go. 
[00:53:00]  We can do it right this second for you, Tom.  Opie, Anthony?  Yeah.  With your permission, I'll be right back.  All right, cool.  He's going to run.  He's going to run and do it right now for you, Tom.  Nice.  I'll put you on hold so you can hear it live instead of through the delay, okay?  All right.  I can't hear Opie and Anthony, so I'm just going to start singing this song by Weezer.  I can't help my feelings.  I go out of my mind. 
[00:53:30]  These players come to get me because they like my behind.  I can't love my business when I can't get a trick.  Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids.  Whoa.  Come on and kick me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said, wow.  Come on and kick me.  Whoa, whoa.  You've got your problems.  I've got my problems. 
[00:54:00]  I've got my ass wide.  I've got my dick cheese.  I've got my hash pie.  One, two, three, four.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine. 
[00:54:30]  Weezer.  Hash pipe.  Thank you very much.  They didn't dump out Adichie's?  Nice.  Oh, how about that?  Thanks for throwing us a bone today, Craig.  Appreciate it.  It's like they're dumping out everything we do.  Ew.  It's horrid.  We have a dump guy that drives us nuts.  I'm sure we drive him nuts as well.  Mm-hmm.  The other day, he dumped out when a guy said that somebody had blasted a fart.  Oh, God.  Did he dump out of that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What was his explanation? 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  You're getting a little touchy on that button.  Yes, they are.  We're working on that, though.  And Frank Caliendo in studio.  He's playing The Stress Factory tomorrow.  No, no, no.  Rascals.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Oh, see what you said?  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  What the hell is he thinking?  I've lost my microphone.  Take a look.  It looks like I'm Amish.  If you can see a visual, this would be a lot better.  Nobody can see because they're not in the studio with O&A, huh?  Where's the cheese guy?  Oh, my God. 
[00:55:30]  Frank Caliendo at Rascals, Anthony.  Yeah.  Rascals.  I'm sorry.  See what happens when Norton plugs that a million times and it was embedded in your head?  I know.  You get confused after that.  Right.  We've got to congratulate Frank Caliendo.  Oh, yeah.  Look at this.  He signed with Mad TV.  Mad TV.  Hey, you are watching Mad TV.  I don't know what to say.  The funny show that's on on Saturday.  Hey, Mad TV, that could be two more letters, three more letters if you counted right.  And that would be Mad and all right. 
[00:56:00]  Even I get sick of Mad and sometimes it's like, hey, time to go home.  Did they sign you just for your Mad and because you do a lot of great voice?  No.  You know, actually, we tried to get a deal together a few years ago before I started doing  Tripe.  Remember that great WB show?  Right, right, right.  Um, it was on for, you know, a week.  It's all right, though.  But, um, but yeah, so, but it all came together that, uh, I'm real happy with it.  It's probably going to make you up like Mad and do the whole thing and the eyebrows, everything.  Yeah.  Get the real good looking deal going. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what that means.  Nice.  Well, let's see, you know, they got a budget on there.  Hey, hey, get a, maybe I could get a guitar and a hat and some boots to say tips on them.  And then, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh.  Hey, it's a turkey leg coming out of my mouth there.  Football.  You can be the Naked John Madden.  Hey, that's usually you got one there, I got two there.  If you figure out what I'm talking about, it's something like cheese. 
[00:57:00]  That would be an interesting thing, the Naked John Madden, yes.  A little too interesting.  Maybe Mad TV might run with that.  Pitch that idea.  We got an idea for you.  It's Madden, and he's naked.  Anything else?  No.  No, no, no.  That's hilarious, dude.  Let's do it.  You know you're going to have to sit there now, because it's brand new.  You're the new guy.  You'll be on there.  They'll pitch you an idea, and you'll be too scared to go, nah, I don't think so.  So you'll be sitting there naked as Madden if they want it. 
[00:57:30]  If they want it, you'll do it.  You'll jump.  I'd love to be a Naked Madden.  Oh, my God.  I'm really happy for you, because the first time you came in, I told Anthony, I go, SNL  or Mad TV would be crazy not to just, you know, get the job.  See, SNL is like the epitome of, like, sketch shows, but it's so crazy, and you don't, nobody's  ever happy there.  Well, there's a bunch of a-holes that work there.  We're really good friends with Jim Brewer, so we've heard all the stories.  Oh, Brewer.  Brewer, when I worked with Brewer, he's like, do you do a Farley? 
[00:58:00]  And he's like, just, yeah.  He just do a little Brewer.  Hey, you do a Farley?  What's that laughing at?  He's like, you want to go ride in my Razor scooter?  He's like, you should be on Saturday Night Live, because he doesn't pronounce all the  words.  You should be on Saturday Night Live.  No, you should.  You should.  You should be on Saturday Night Live.  Like, I don't, I don't, I don't know if I want to do that.  Did you like his?  I don't want to say his name.  But he had a great time there on SNL. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, it was a lot of fun going in the, um, the little meetings that they, uh, gave.  Let's pitch something.  No one's going to like it, okay?  That's Lorne Michaels.  No, no, it's not.  I don't know where you're saying this stuff.  I don't know who that was.  That was Dr. Eagle.  Anthony is, Opie, I'm sorry.  You said the wrong place.  I'll call you the wrong person, man.  Hey, what's going on?  Just as a crack whore, it's all better, okay?  I want to, I'm going to try to, I'm going to put him on the spot right now.  Uh, Madonna's in town, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Playing, uh, a bunch of sold-out shows at the Garden.  And, uh, and in the post today, or is it the Daily News?  They have a picture of Jerry Seinfeld and his wife.  Post.  Um, after the Madonna show.  I guess Jerry was at the show.  Yeah, what's Jerry doing?  His arms are up in the air.  I'm pretending about a roller coaster.  There he is.  Oh, yeah, we're going up.  Oh, we're going up.  There's a little train, things going up the hill.  We're going, oh, we're going down.  That's what he looks like.  He's holding his arms up in the air like he's on a roller coaster.  I mean, what's the deal with me? 
[00:59:30]  I thought I wanted, I mean, it looks like I'm starting the wave.  Yeah.  That's after the show.  He was just saying hi to all the fans and stuff.  So he puts his arms up in the air and they take a picture and say, this is the most ridiculous  picture we've got of Jerry.  Let's put this in the paper.  And you know they do that.  Let's print this one.  Yeah, they probably had a bunch of very normal pictures of him.  The problem is he's standing on my back.  I carried that guy on my back for a bunch of years.  I can't believe he did that terrible joke.  I don't remember seeing Kramer there at the Madonna show.  Because I was on the ground the entire time. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, you are under Jerry.  Having some fun, you know what I mean?  Yeah!  When you can't think of a joke to say, that's what you do.  You scream, because if you run out of things to say, there's a scream or a fall down, and  that is hilarious.  We can't all be good with the words.  Oh, I'm your lucky star, Jerry.  Let's go!  Yeah!  Wait a second.  You know my lucky star?  Oh, I'll be your lucky star.  You guys are going to let me run with this until it's into the ground, aren't you? 
[01:00:30]  No, I just want to know if Newman was at the damn show last night.  Just like the material girl.  What's up with this, naked cowboy?  You're wearing the cone bra, man.  What's up with that?  Pointy as nice.  Why wasn't Newman in Jurassic Park 3?  He was killed.  Because he was dead.  He was killed in the first one.  Haven't you guys ever listened to the end of my bit?  What? 
[01:01:00]  He was the guy that ruined Jurassic Park.  They wouldn't invite him back.  That's true.  That was so stupid of me.  I thought I killed him in my own bit.  Here's a guy who doesn't know his own bit.  I thought I killed Newman off in my bit, but I don't.  I forgot the big spitting thing got him, right?  The little spitting dinosaur got him?  Who am I?  What do I know?  Do we have that time, Phil, Bill?  We haven't played that while.  We'll play it as we go to break.  All right.  And, of course, more from Lounge Against the Machine.  Oh, you want to do another one?  I'll run out there.  Hold on.  I've got to plug the CD.  Thank goodness I don't have to play in a band because I could not run back and forth out 
[01:01:30]  of the studio.  Well, it keeps me trim.  Hey, how weird is it that you're playing to a wall?  We actually have a huge audience out there.  There's like six or seven.  People are starting to come around now?  Yeah, there's a bunch of people out there.  Because when we do have bands on the show, it's always weird because we set them up in such  a way that the lead singer is just staring at a wall.  Actually, I'm facing the opposite direction because I cannot turn my back on my band for  one minute.  See, you're smart.  Look at that.  Yeah, they'll rob me blind.  It's called Lounge Against the Machine.  We love these guys.  We've been playing their music off and off for the last month or so.  And they're playing the Mercury Lounge? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, tomorrow night.  And we're also going to be on the Fox News channel tomorrow morning.  Oh.  We're going to be at five in the damn morning.  Wow, look at you.  So we're very excited about that.  But we're apparently not playing.  We're just going to be in the background going like this.  Hi, Katie.  I don't think she's on that show.  No, not on Fox.  How about some Nine Inch Nails for the kids?  Sure.  Oh, that's good.  All right, I'll be right back.  Just make it radio-friendly, you know.  Oh.  All right.  Closer, baby.  One, two, three.  Closer.  One, two, three, four. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, you.  I said, you let me violate you.  You let me desecrate you.  You let me penetrate you.  You let me complicate you.  I said, help me.  I broke apart my inside.  Help me.  I've got no soul to sell. 
[01:03:00]  Help me.  The only thing that works for me.  Help me get away from myself.  I want to do you like an animal.  I want to feel you from the inside.  I want to do you with an animal.  You get me closer to God.  God. 
[01:03:30]  Thank you.  Yeah.  Richard Cheese, they lounge against the machine.  They can't hear us, but they're doing a great job.  Oh, I can hear you, baby.  Hey, they're our band today, Anthony.  How cool is that, huh?  Thank you, guys.  Thank you very much.  All right, we've got to take a break.  And now I've got to play Frank Caliendo's bit to see if he did indeed kill off Newman at the end of his bit.  Let's check that.  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  Let's check that out.  Yeah, that'll be fun.  All right.  Frank Caliendo's hanging with us today, and he's playing rassels.  I'll enjoy that.  My idiocy.  All right, here it is.  Just put it up on a pedestal.  Knock him down.  We'll be back. 
[01:04:00]  I did like a whole cast of Seinfeld in like an anti-drug episode.  If they never did stuff like that, that would have been funnier.  Like, tonight on a very special Seinfeld, Jerry's been doing drugs.  Why do my fingers look like little people?  Who are these people?  What are they doing?  They're talking to each other.  They're talking about me.  What are they saying?  George, help me, George.  I have no idea, Jerry.  No idea.  Somebody help me.  Hey, Jerry, you look like you've been seeing little people on your fingers.  All this comedy, all these years, we thought you're making this stuff up.  Well, I guess you just let the cat... 
[01:04:30]  Right out of the bag.  You can't tell.  Oh, I can tell.  It's written all over your face.  I wrote it on my face.  Well, maybe that was the little people on your fingers.  Who could have done this to me?  Newman.  Hello, Jerry.  Hello, Newman.  I think we've also said of Jerry Garcia at Brankful Denkham, a bit of stabs.  You haven't seen them.  Have you seen them?  I licked them.  Now I'm seeing little people on my fingers.  You ruined my life.  You ruined everybody's life.  In fact, you're the guy who dropped that thing and ruined Jurassic Park.  And you guys got it. 
[01:05:00]  The first radio station ever to get my bit.  Of course you got it, man.  That's great.  That was Newman.  Bravo, man.  Newman screwed the whole damn thing up.  Jerry, I'm back again.  Driving that Jeep in the mud.  Yeah.  There's nothing better than a good Newman.  I love it.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between a curious demusement and outright horror. 
[01:05:30]  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Truly tasteless and not funny.  Ah, Bud Light.  Bud Light.  You want a light beer.  You want Bud Light.  Let me tell you about that.  I love Bud Light because it tastes like Bud.  That's all I got to need to know.  That's all I need to know.  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  Summer's here. 
[01:06:00]  It's very hot.  You going to the beach?  You going to the ball game?  Bud Light.  The perfect companion for your outing.  Oh, great.  Look.  I, right now, I'm going to drink an ice cold Bud Light.  Listen.  Listen.  Ugh.  Bud Light.  Oh, my God.  Bud Light.  When you...  Shut up.  Yes.  Bud Light.  We love it.  We drink it here all the time.  Let me take another sip of my ice cold Bud Light. 
[01:06:30]  Wait a minute.  Oh.  You know, nothing tastes like a Bud Light.  That's right, Eric.  Except a Bud.  You guys want some Bud Light music?  It's a Bud Light.  All right.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony.  Saturdays, 11 to 3.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Frank Caliendo in the studio playing Rascals in New...  Well, it's New Jersey, officially. 
[01:07:00]  Tomorrow and Saturday.  Well, I say in New York because, you know, we broadcast from New York, but it's actually...  All right.  Whatever.  And Richard Cheese is in here with Lounge Against the Machine.  They're playing the Mercury Lounge tomorrow night.  And we have a treat for you guys.  Is it the naked cowboy?  No, we can only wish.  You had that treat.  Damn.  We gave you that one already.  That was a freebie.  We have guys with man boobs coming in in a little while.  Oh, I saw one of those guys. 
[01:07:30]  It's the man boob contest, yeah.  George.  Well, we're looking for guys that have problems with their man boobs and want to get rid of them.  We have a doctor that'll do this.  And the guys, you don't want to go to the beach.  If you've got the man boobs.  Or if you're an overweight guy, it doesn't really matter.  Because they expect it.  Hitting homes.  But they're...  But if you're like a skinny guy and you have the man boobs, that's a problem.  You've got to get that taken care of.  Yeah, we had a guy come in here yesterday. 
[01:08:00]  He has Asian boobs.  I'll pop it right up on the website.  Asian boobs.  They look like Asian girl boobs.  And you know you've seen them.  You have the internet.  Stop it.  The rest of them is normal.  You haven't seen the puke videos with the little Asian girls vomiting on each other?  Oh, yeah.  Just look like I'm the only one.  Yeah.  Sure.  See, look at this guy.  Check out this guy.  Now, that guy's got a problem, right?  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Call a doctor.  See?  He's got little Asian woman breasts right there on his man body.  That is 100% wrong.  Yeah.  So we can take care of that if it turns out he wins.  Can I see that guy's picture again?  I can't get enough of this guy.  Oh, Lord.  See, you've got the side view where they look like little banana boobs.  Banana boobs.  Oh.  He's got the...  Can't we just give that guy the free procedure? 
[01:09:00]  I know.  And say the contest is over.  Can't we do a couple push-ups or something?  Those aren't like...  No, because...  You can tell those aren't really the type that go away with push-ups.  Yeah.  Then they'll just look like that chick on the back of the bike during bike week flashing  with those flapjack things.  You know?  Yeah.  That's why they call them man boobs.  They're guys out of shape or whatever, but their breast area looks like...  It's proportional to your gut.  Yeah.  Like what a guy should look like.  But that is like a...  It's got a cup feature.  Yeah.  That is a cup. 
[01:09:30]  And then there's this guy.  Right.  When you can cradle, it's not good.  Look at this guy.  He's actually doing a little thing where he tries to make some more cleavage for himself.  Trying to pad the vote.  That guy, not too bad.  There are some really bad ones, though.  Look at this guy.  Look at him.  Oh!  Hey, hey!  The top view is great.  And the side view.  Wait, turn that around.  Is that the guy that...  His chest looks like a big W?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  He's got the pointy...  Pointy.  Pointy man boobs.  A 12-year-old girl. 
[01:10:00]  There's a couple inverted mountains there.  Yeah.  I think we have a contest after all, because I forgot how bad that guy was.  See, but that guy's fat.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not boobs.  It's like a fat guy.  I don't want the people to be confused.  You've got to vote for the guy that will benefit the most from the procedure.  Just because, you know, you're fat doesn't mean, like, the procedure's going to help you.  This guy's the guy you always see at, like, the amusement parks with his shirt off for some bizarre reason.  Or anywhere in Wisconsin.  Yeah, this guy's got him, too. 
[01:10:30]  Look at the side shot there.  Got a little cup going there.  Got a little A cup.  That's not as bad as the Asian boob guy.  No, the Asian boob guy.  And then Ass Man, who is just a big mess.  510 pounds.  Doctors.  No, there's a crack.  Yeah, the show is, uh...  His other cleavage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't really like your website.  It doesn't have anything I'm looking for on the internet.  Well, I agree with you.  We have all the things on there.  All right.  I'll have to find other places.  We had a hot-ass contest.  Oh, that's good.  That might have been my favorite thing ever. 
[01:11:00]  And those guys looked great.  No, I got it.  That might have not been my favorite thing ever.  And then we had a best boobie contest.  Oh, that's good.  How come I didn't get on that day?  Coming soon, uh...  Yeah.  I'm in a room with the man boobs and there's the naked cowboy.  Right.  Uh, look who else you missed.  Oh, well...  Oh, hey.  Gloria Ann.  Gloria Ann walking around Manhattan with nothing but a little bit of whipped cream on her, um...  Yeah, all on the website.  Nice.  See, now this is better, right? 
[01:11:30]  The website's a little better now.  Yeah, I like that.  Now you're liking our website.  Now I'm like, better.  Wait, go back.  Yeah, you insulted Anthony and he had to prove you wrong.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, wait.  Hey, there's like six million photos on that.  Oh, there's a bunch.  Yeah, that's cool.  All right, we're going to put a link to your site at our site.  All right.  You can see all this if you go to opieandanthony.com.  We finally got that website back.  Really?  Yeah.  We couldn't be happier, yeah.  Some tool was, uh, you know, holding us hostage.  Some guy had it that's just like, I hate you guys, but I got your domain name. 
[01:12:00]  Deke.  And we're going to make you pay.  We didn't have to pay anything.  Yeah, I had, uh, when I got richardcheese.com, I couldn't get, I couldn't get dickcheese.com.  You couldn't?  No, because that's a porn site.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Who knew?  Someone took your name and made it a porn site?  I think so.  Richard?  Richard?  Richard?  Yeah, I know.  There are certain keywords that you know you will never, ever get a domain name.  Right.  Anything nude, naked.  Uh, the name dick, for some reason, very popular on websites. 
[01:12:30]  So you'll, you'll never see that one.  Um, snatch, very hard to get, too.  Difficult.  And what if you're a pickpocket or a thief?  And you want snatch.com?  Snatch.com is a little instructional website.  You're, you're screwed.  Because you know you're not going to see, uh, techniques on pickpockets.  No.  That was the most innocent sounding.  Well, I was sincere when I saw that.  It was very funny.  That was the same Tony you used yesterday with, uh, Cindy Williams.  Oh, dear, sweet Lord.  What?  So this, this isn't something you're, you're enjoying, Cindy?  What?  Can I ask you a question? 
[01:13:00]  I heard a little bit of Garrett Morris.  Oh.  Garrett Morris has lost his mind.  Why does he, why does he feel it was, did he feel it was necessary to refer to ladies  and gentlemen all the time?  Like, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to tell you something.  Ladies and gentlemen.  He never, like, like, the people who listen to the radio are going, oh, who is he talking  to?  Ladies and gentlemen, of course I'm talking to you right now.  That's true.  He would address everybody.  Ladies and gentlemen, if I may, comma, and then add the rest of the sentence.  It was very respectful. 
[01:13:30]  Well, we have a little bit of Garrett Morris' appearance.  Would you like to hear it?  Oh, I'd love to.  All right.  He was in here for, like, 30 or 40 minutes, and he just babbled.  Ladies and gentlemen, there's some boobs in front of me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And this was just, uh, this is like a quick three or four minutes, so let's check it out.  Garrett Morris from the other day, from SNL fame.  Painful.  Well, Garrett Morris is, uh, hugging Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  And Jim said.  Aw, me.  I'll wait till the music stops. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, I'll wait till the music stops.  But now they've been found.  And they were lost.  But now they're at sea.  No, no.  Thank you, Lord.  Play a song like Decaptown Lady. 
[01:14:30]  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.  What the hell was that?  I think Chico Square took one too many balls to the head.  I'm a Miss Plebeian, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm a Miss Plebeian, you know.  I pay you boys to build a railroad.  I'm a Miss Philistines.  I'm a Miss Philistines.  I'm a Miss Philistines.  I'm a Miss Philistines, ladies and gentlemen.  But I want you to know.  The Camptown Lady.  That I have not sinned.  No.  I have not sinned.  Tell her, brother.  Okay?  I came here in good faith. 
[01:15:00]  Lord have mercy.  Garrett, I got to ask you something.  And my good name has been drilled through the mud.  I'm sorry, Jim Norton.  You know?  And you have brought my name through the mud.  Hey, if we can't have dice on the show, what the hell?  Garrett Morris will do.  Andrew Dice Clay?  Yes.  Oh, that's my mantra.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Hey, how you doing?  Go ahead, man.  Hey, how you doing?  Talk, bro.  Talk, bro.  Hey, this is the man's show.  How come I get banned from this show?  This is the man's show.  This is the man's show.  Go talk, bro.  Talk, bro. 
[01:15:30]  How come I get banned from Saturday Night Live?  Just because I don't like you.  I don't like you.  I don't like you.  I don't know.  I've been banned my damn self, so what the s*** about you, man?  You ever seen me on the last 20 years or so?  Hey, Garrett, what is that like when you get shot?  That's got to hurt, right?  In other words, nothing is sick.  No, no.  I got to know.  I don't.  I got to know.  Don't ask that question, Mr. Morris.  Don't ask it.  What happened in that situation? 
[01:16:00]  Because you heard about it, but I never heard any details afterwards.  Well, well, that, that, know why you never heard the details?  Why?  Because I don't want to tell you the details.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Good.  All right.  You don't ever want to tell me the details.  Well, you know what I mean?  I have spinal cord injury, bro.  You did?  The thing went through my spine.  I'm supposed to be a quadriplegic.  And you're walking.  Now, watch it.  Now, laugh.  I ain't laughing.  Yeah, you are.  Yeah, you are.  Why would I laugh?  Yeah, you're laughing.  Yeah, you're laughing.  Why would I laugh at something like that?  You want to laugh.  Why would I laugh at something like that? 
[01:16:30]  Because you're a student of sick comedy, and you guys laugh at anything.  And there's nothing else sacred.  That's right.  Yeah.  You guys don't.  Hey, there you go.  You guys don't hold anything, Zigaret.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch.  I'll say Jesus Christ.  See, I think we got off on the bad on a wrong question.  Mother.  Mother.  Mother.  Mother.  Mother.  What's the name of the lady who just died?  Mother Teresa.  Mother Teresa.  Yeah.  Yeah, she just died.  He laughed.  He laughed.  He laughed.  He laughed.  That was funny. 
[01:17:00]  Jim Laird.  The guy's got no conscience.  Martha Washington.  What?  You're a legend in the comedy bit.  No, I'm...  No, you are.  No, no, no, no.  And you were injured, so he wanted to ask it.  No.  You're setting me up for nothing.  Okay?  I'm the least one in this line.  Okay?  I ain't no legend in my own mind.  I ain't nothing but just a common-art American black boy trying to make a living in this man's  world.  You know what I mean?  Garrett, seriously.  And y'all just picking on black people.  That's all you do.  No, Garrett. 
[01:17:30]  It's so easy.  I don't think it's bad if they're s***, you know what I mean?  Oh, yeah, man.  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  Let's all sing one of the songs I think can bring everyone together that Garrett made famous  back on SNL.  I'm going to get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see.  I'm going to get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see.  I see women in this thing.  I see women.  That one rules. 
[01:18:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know I love white people, okay?  They're all right with me.  Of course.  Okay?  What do I do all right with me?  I did happen to write that song.  That's true.  It's a legendary bit.  But I have nothing against white people, particularly white ladies.  Please don't get turned off by the song.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Hey, Garrett, we're going to say thank you.  The great Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris.  The great Garrett Morris. 
[01:18:30]  Garrett Morris.  There he goes.  Garrett Morris.  Feel the love.  Feel the love.  Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris, everyone.  Keep clapping until he leaves.  Garrett Morris.  Thank you.  Jackpot opening Friday with the great Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris, everyone.  Keep clapping until he leaves.  Garrett Morris, everybody.  We love Garrett Morris. 
[01:19:00]  There he goes.  Jay Moore getting some love from Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris.  Oh, my gosh.  Okay.  All right.  The great Garrett Morris.  Maybe the gunfire sound effects weren't really appropriate.  He was out of his freaking mind the other day.  I don't know what he was trying to do.  But you're right.  Everything was, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen.  He sounded like he actually started crying.  Was he kind of crying?  Pseudo-guy?  I think he was in character. 
[01:19:30]  Gotcha.  The whole time as a nut.  As a lunatic.  Yeah, we think.  Hey, where did Richard Cheese go?  Maybe outside?  Yeah, I want to talk to him in the studio.  Because he says he knows some Britney Spears.  Yeah, we're going to play some Britney Spears.  Oh, nice.  Well, we have Marv Albert here.  And he was going to say something about Britney Spears, I believe.  I would love to hear some Britney Spears.  One of the finest young ladies in the history of pop music.  A lady who would make me literally blow my top. 
[01:20:00]  Don't dump that out.  Please.  Marv, you're not going to bite her back, are you?  Not right away, but after a few short seconds, I might Garrett Morris or whatever that might be.  Just dropping a name to see if I can get an effect.  We're going to do a little Britney Spears for you.  She drives you crazy.  You drive me crazy.  I just can't sleep.  Loving you, I'm in too deep. 
[01:20:30]  Crazy, and it feels all right.  Loving you keeps me up all night.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  This is a wonderful Britney Spears.  A little taste of Britney Spears.  A little taste exactly.  Thank you. 
[01:21:00]  We're going to be doing that.  We're going to be doing that number tomorrow at the Mercury Lounge.  And if someone wants to buy our CD, Lounge Against the Machine, you can pick it up at our website,  richardcheese.com, or any record store where they sell music.  Thank you.  Very good.  Very good.  Thank you.  And thank you.  No, no, really.  Thank you.  And did I thank you?  Yes, you did.  Good.  Thank you, too.  All right.  Thank you.  I like these guys.  Are the man-boob guys ready to come in?  Did you take their pictures?  Not yet.  Not yet?  They're not ready yet?  Not yet.  Oh, they're not ready, or you haven't taken the pictures?  They're just finishing up the paperwork.  Oh.  Yeah.  Those pesky disclaimers. 
[01:21:30]  They're not allowed on the show anymore without paperwork.  Without paperwork.  The pesky disclaimer forms that people have to fill out.  Yes.  Getting ready to see some man-boobs.  One of the finest accomplishments in my life.  Actually, no, they are ready.  They are?  All right.  The paperwork's all been filled out.  Rick Delgado changing his mind.  Right.  Explaining to the rest of the Opie and Anthony cast of today, which is nowhere near the 30  people in the studio that were here while Garrett Morris was here. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Well, if Al Pacino wants to comment on some of the man-boobs, I know he's around here somewhere.  I got no problem.  I met Georgie Hafferack over here just a couple minutes ago.  Nice guy.  I got no problem.  Wow.  We got quite a few guys in here.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Who's who?  I guess you got to stand up to the mic and show us what you got.  That's Frank Caliendo.  And what's your name?  I'm Lorden.  And you got the man-boobs happening?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, well, okay. 
[01:22:30]  Well, okay.  Yeah.  Here they go.  Well.  Well, um, I don't know.  Wait till you see some of the other stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I assure you we're women from the waist up?  Huh?  We're women from the waist up.  You think so?  Waist up chicks.  I don't know.  I don't think you're really sporting that big a man-boobs there.  I think you just want to come down and hang.  That's just fine.  Well, that's fine.  No, I thought it was an invitation for fat guys to come down to the station.  It's not necessarily fat guys.  I got to explain.  Did you see the guy with the Asian boobs? 
[01:23:00]  I thought that was me.  He could have been more than, what, 150, 160 pounds?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  You could fit inside this guy.  No, because I was here yesterday.  You were here yesterday as well?  Okay.  All right.  Who else have we got?  I got to say, you're, you know, you got little A's.  There's nothing.  What's your name, bro?  Christopher.  Hey, Christopher.  How are you?  All right.  All right.  Let's see what you got.  I can't believe I had to say this.  Yeah.  See, that's what you're looking at.  Look, look, bro.  That's what we're looking for.  That's what we're looking for.  Look at that.  Those are meaty.  That's a good B cup. 
[01:23:30]  That's a, that's a, wow.  That's a B cup.  This was so much more fun when it was the ass contest.  Yeah.  Well, Frank, you got to get used to this.  All right.  I'm okay.  You got to be a part of the O&A family.  You got to take the good with the bad.  You take the good, you take the bad.  You never know what you're going to get when you listen to the show or come by.  It's like going into battle with your friends.  You don't know if it's going to be a day where you're just hanging out, smoking, smoking some weed and eating some sea rations under the sun.  Or you're just going to be in battle and one of your buddies might end up dead.  Or you're just taking a look at a guy's chest.  Right.  Right.  Some days, you know, you get to see the old neighbor, you know, bending over to pull out the weeds. 
[01:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  You don't want to see that.  Some 50-year-old taint.  Right.  Adam Carolla of analogies we are not today.  Right.  Sometimes you're bending over to see a guy down the street who's got a pair of legs.  And that's what I mean by an analogy.  I had a second hand to that, though.  The other side of the house, you got the teenage girl.  Wow.  But she's, you know, and how do we get there?  What's the address? 
[01:24:30]  What's the address of the house?  We fixed it, too.  Nice fix.  I tried.  And how's the weather?  Right.  Can we see?  Actually, she's at school and the whole thing sucked.  Okay.  What do we got here, man?  They call me Little Stevie.  Little Stevie.  And look, you're a big guy.  I love that gag.  How long have they been calling you Little Stevie?  It's wacky.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Okay.  He's got D's.  We got a winner.  He's got D's.  We got a freaking winner.  Now, you're a big guy, but you also have... 
[01:25:00]  Stop moving them.  Huge.  Just move them.  Those are really big.  Man.  Yeah.  Are you proud of those things?  What?  Actually, no.  No.  Do your friends feel them up and stuff?  You let your friends...  The ones with broken hands, yeah, they tried.  You know what?  They tried.  I would bet a lot of money if you blindfolded a guy and had him, you know, touch those.  Really?  He would have no clue that it was on a guy.  Why don't you have him come in for a blind Dave's lap dance, and we'll dangle him in front  of him, and he could grab a handful.  Little Stevie, could you show Al Pacino, once again, your man boobs? 
[01:25:30]  Take it all off.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy S.  That's a pair of nips tonight.  That's...  Those are like...  You know what that looks like?  Lady Di.  One of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely does.  Looks just like her from the neck down.  Well, you're going to be in the running.  That's very obvious.  Yeah.  You think?  Bravo.  Yeah.  Bravo.  Hey, get it? 
[01:26:00]  Bravo.  We'll just let that lay there.  Bravo.  Yeah, look.  Okay, here's a picture of Lady Di, right?  Doesn't that look like him?  Yeah, very much.  Absolutely.  Who else we got?  You really know the boobs.  Oh, yeah.  What's your name, man?  Walter.  Hey, Walter.  Let's see what you got.  Follow that, Walter.  Let's see.  Oh, man.  Wait a minute.  Walter.  You're really not...  You're not sporting anything.  A few...  You just want to hang out, right?  You want to just hang out.  Yeah.  Look at this.  Honesty makes things okay. 
[01:26:30]  You love the honest.  A few push-ups and you would be just fine, man.  Who else we got?  How you doing, George?  Hey, George.  All right.  Well, unfortunately, I just have one.  See, like, this one.  Look at this one.  Wow, what happened there, man?  This is that.  You look like Betty Ford.  Oh, my goodness.  I've tried.  Like, I've lost weight.  I've tried to get rid of it.  It just...  Wait a minute.  That is one boom.  Just one.  Yeah, the other one's fine.  This one, but...  Wait a minute.  But this one.  Hold.  Turn sideways.  What the F is going on there?  Yeah.  Pull up your pants, first of all. 
[01:27:00]  That looks like, um...  You have an A cup on your left side.  That's what we got.  And it jiggles like a real boob.  Yeah.  I would...  That's nothing.  Dude, do you spank it with your right hand and just feel yourself up at the left?  Why not?  You got, like, an extra boob there.  He's half a chick.  It just started happening when I was, like, 16 years old.  And there's nothing wrong?  It just started growing on one side and not the other?  No, yeah.  That is so weird. 
[01:27:30]  I noticed it, like I said, when I was 16.  Just this one...  It's like Teen Wolf.  He's got...  Yeah, it just happened.  He's got a boob there.  We set that up, by the way, on the outside earlier.  I tried to set it up.  I was like...  You know, I'm a big fan of the show, man.  And it's expensive to get this procedure done.  It's like...  It's like...  It's like...  It's like $2,500 to get it done.  For one or both?  Because you only need one, right?  You might get half price.  Can I get one?  You know, like, if we pick a winner, can we get, like, just one done?  Wow.  I can't...  What do you do at the beach and stuff? 
[01:28:00]  Buy two, get one free.  Here's what I do.  If I walk around, I go like this.  You've got the old towel around.  Oh, right.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it sucks.  The right one is completely normal that you'd see on a guy.  And the left one...  Left one is a...  It's a breast.  It looks like a 14-year-old girl's boob.  Yeah, pretty much.  No, that's more 13.  Yeah.  That was a very wrong...  That's where I put it.  You like that analogy?  What happens when you're a little easier?  You're with girls, and you've got to take the shirt off.  You break the news to them? 
[01:28:30]  It's so embarrassing, because girls notice it.  Because, you know, when you're, like, snung with a girl, like, they pet around, and they're  like, wait a minute.  They're like, they...  Wow.  They're like, wait a minute, and they...  Something's up, you know?  And then you just grab both of theirs.  I usually try to, like, turn over or something like that.  But, like, they know...  Do you sometimes go, look, I'm going to take my shirt off.  I got a little something to tell you.  You ever tried to break it to them beforehand?  I did, and some girls get really bugged out about it.  That's why it's, like, it's not...  She grabs it, and you go, you effing dyke.  You should just...  You should just... 
[01:29:00]  I'm not doing this for the intent.  I'm doing it.  I'm trying to get...  I really would love to get this procedure.  You know what?  You don't need your face in the pictures.  You know?  Yeah.  I mean...  And I'm a big fan.  Because I...  I don't...  I wouldn't want my face.  I really don't want my face.  No, you don't have to.  That's the option if you come down here.  You know, he's a...  I think he's a favorite in this.  I think he's going to be a favorite, because he is a guy that can really...  Here's a guy.  Hey!  Hey!  Wait a minute, Anthony!  Hey, if I was going to see on the left side, he's a girl.  On the right side, he's a guy, and if you put it all together, and you turn yourself 
[01:29:30]  around, that's what it's all about.  Thank you, John.  Matt.  It's like, I mean, I don't have a problem getting girls.  It's just that once your shirt comes off...  Yeah, now there's a problem.  You know, what's that?  What's going on there?  You know, for a goof, though, you should grow your hair really long on the left side.  Makeup on half.  Any other things on one side of the body that the other that isn't normal?  Everything else is normal, yeah.  Yeah, I got on, like, a left testicle that's bigger than the right.  Right, nothing like that.  That is so freaking weird.  Talk about bad luck.  That's going to make the voting very interesting. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Is he only going to have to get hot to vote?  I'd really appreciate all the listeners if he could just, you know...  Yeah, but look at little Stevie over there.  He's sporting some serious Ds.  Skinny guys, though, you know?  Well, that's what we're going to leave.  See, I lost weight, and it still stayed, you know?  We're going to leave that up to the listeners.  He was 400 pounds upstairs.  He lost weight on the way down just for this.  Except in that.  Hey, Richard Cheese, did you see that?  No, I didn't see it.  All right, Richard.  Unfortunately, I have to ask.  Look at this.  Let me just give you the headlines, because, I mean, everyone's pretty good.  But first of all, you've got to see Little Stevie.  Little Stevie, show Richard Cheese what you're sporting there. 
[01:30:30]  Which one?  Little?  He's not exactly little.  Oh, I did see those.  I saw those when I walked out.  No, did you see him without the shirt on?  Yeah, I did.  That's why I left the room.  Did you see this guy with the one?  No, let me see the one.  He's got the one.  Look at this.  Yeah, that side is the weirdest thing.  Isn't that something?  Yeah, he is a...  Yeah, he...  That's like a chick's boob.  Have you tried working out and stuff?  Yeah.  Nothing happens, right?  I curl, and it just doesn't...  It won't...  It doesn't work.  Does the left side of you want to go on a date?  You want to hang out?  It's a pretty good girl boob. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, it's like a very small waif-like...  What, maybe 13, 14, would you say?  I put it at 13, exactly, yeah.  She didn't even wear a t-shirt at work.  Like, I was at work the other night, and my manager's like, she's like, you have a breast.  Oh, gee, thanks for telling me like I didn't notice, you twat.  So now I've got to wear, like, dark shirts or, like, you know, like, you know, layer down this way so that, you know...  Right.  How about a holster?  Maybe a security job, you know?  Put the gun up there and then...  Shoulder holster. 
[01:31:30]  You don't have any problem.  No one can see it behind the gun.  And if they see it, you shoot them.  If they say anything.  You know what, just, can I interrupt real quick?  Every time I usually talk on stage, I have a piano playing with me.  So can we bring out my piano guy?  Because I normally get piano...  Yeah, there you go.  Bobby, thank you.  Okay, good.  And can I have this with John Madden all the time, too?  Yeah.  We'll do it for John and me only.  All right, good.  Thank you.  I just want to know what Adam Sandler thinks of this one boomed guy here.  I think that it needs an operation.  A definite, uh, take a little needle and pop it.  Because that one is, he's not going to be okay. 
[01:32:00]  He's not at it.  And on one side, the man has a man.  On the other side, the first part of a woman.  And we want to make it all man.  Can you help the man?  Let the man be.  Make the man a man.  Yeah, something.  I was waiting for that.  I didn't know what was happening, but apparently Opie did.  Yes. 
[01:32:30]  Very good.  And who else do we got?  Alfred.  Hey, Alfred, what's going on?  You think you could beat any of these guys we've just seen?  Maybe him.  Maybe him.  He points to the guy that had nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, let's see what you got, man.  You know, that might have been good on day one.  You know, but now we're getting some real contenders here.  But you never know.  It's not up to us.  It's not up to us.  It'll be up to the listeners, so.  All right, guys, once you get your pictures taken, I mean, you can hang and stuff.  You know, grab a Bud Light or a Sam Adams. 
[01:33:00]  But keep your shirts on from here on.  Please.  Please, yes.  Wow, that is something.  I mean, these guys, half of them is a guy and half of them is a girl.  I mean, I remember when I was alive, first of all, that men were men and women were women.  Isn't that an Archie Bunker thing?  Guys were goyles and men were men.  Right.  Frank Caliendo played Rascals this weekend.  And, God, there's so much going on here.  Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine, they're playing the Mercury Lounge tomorrow night. 
[01:33:30]  That's right, tomorrow night, and we're going to be in Baltimore at the Fletcher's,  if anyone's going to be driving to Baltimore this weekend.  We'll be at Fletcher's in Baltimore, and then we're playing Vegas in August.  He's playing the Archie Bunker.  That's right, he's best.  Bobby Ricotta on piano is out there.  Bobby Ricotta.  Bobby Ricotta and the Cheese here.  Who are the other guys?  The drummer is Buddy Gouda, and my bass player is Gordon Brie, and it's an honor.  Marv Albert is chiming in again.  These guys all have names of cheese.  Yeah, I just got it myself. 
[01:34:00]  Wondering.  Where did you go to find all these men's names?  That is the craziest thing.  You can go on the yellow pages under musicians, then it's a subparagraph with dairy product name,  and then you just go down the list.  Looks like the cheeses.  That's right.  Fabulous.  Do you want to play us out of this break here?  I would love to.  Boys, what do you say we do?  Why don't you pick a song for us, Opie?  How about some Beastie Boys?  Beastie Boys.  Excellent.  Did he just say, why don't you pick a song for us?  How about some Beastie Boys?  It's all about manipulating the audience. 
[01:34:30]  I don't take requests.  Are you kidding?  I'll be right back.  Beastie Boys usually rock.  Sure, sure.  A four, and a three, and a two, and a one.  Kick it.  Kick it.  Kick it.  Kick it.  Kick it.  Kick it.  Kick it.  Kick it.  You wake up late for school, man.  You don't want to go.  You ask your mom please, but she still says no. 
[01:35:00]  Man, living in this house, it's such a drag.  Your mom tossed out your best porno man.  Busted.  You have to fight for that right to part.  Thank you.

[01:37:30]  Wow.  How do you lose an SUV?  What do you mean?  How do you lose one?  I just found out I turned in my Mercury Mountaineer back in the beginning of June at Bay Ridge Lincoln Mercury.  I get a collection thing coming to my house saying they can't find the truck and it was never turned in.  I turned in early June.  Now I'm like, as far as like creditors go, I've been driving around in it. 
[01:38:00]  What?  They lost my truck!  Thank you.  Bay Ridge Lincoln Mercury.  When you dropped it off, didn't you say, here's my truck?  Yeah, and I picked up a new one.  You say, can I get a receipt?  I should have.  I should have done something.  Can I get a receipt next time?  Oh, no.  So now it seems it's missing.  Maybe you just dropped it off to a homie or something.  Maybe.  It was the guy on the corner that was like, can I have that truck?  I was like, wait a minute. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, okay.  You work here, right?  Oh, yeah, I work here.  Okay, well, do you need me to sign anything?  No.  No, no.  Just give me the keys.  All right.  Or somebody built a big fake car lot.  Just the front, which, of course, if you ask Rick, who used to work at Universal Studios,  that's called a facade, which means false front.  Can I come inside and sign some papers?  No, you can't come inside.  Don't even come inside.  We'd prefer you don't.  Can I check one of the other cars?  No.  No, they're... 
[01:39:00]  No, no, no.  Not right now.  I thought when I was driving away, I saw a big gust of wind, and the whole front of the  store just fell down.  I thought I saw that, but I said no.  And then Tumbleweed came across.  Couldn't have happened.  They better straighten it out.  Well, yeah.  Denise, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  Good.  We're having a little party today.  Good, good.  But you're killing me.  Why?  The first time, you know, you have all these hot chicks with D-cups, whatever, on the show.  I can deal with that, being a small-breasted woman.  Now, you've got men with much bigger boobs than they have. 
[01:39:30]  It's really...  It's hurting my feelings.  D-cups.  We have a man, little Stevie.  He's got solid D-cups.  Yeah.  Solid.  I'm like an A-minus.  You're killing me.  Oh, an A-minus?  Yeah.  But are they the perky ones or the little flapjacks?  Oh, no.  They're cute and perky.  They always say they're cute.  No, they are.  No, I like all sizes.  Yeah, but...  I've learned to love all sizes.  You've got to hook a come-along onto each nip to TF her. 
[01:40:00]  It's not even possible.  I've tried.  The guy has to be huge.  Hey, Denise, I'd rather see your boobs than all these guy boobs that we have around here  today.  Wow, you're really going out on a limb there, Opie.  You're a rebel.  Just trying to make it feel good.  Dan, if I just left the city, I would have stopped by.  Come on by.  Speaking of which, we need a really hot girl to stop by today, because this show is way  too gay.  Yeah, you know something?  I agree.  It started with the naked cowboy, and it never got any better from there.  It degenerated.  Now, we've got one guy hanging in the studio. 
[01:40:30]  He's got one freaking boob on him.  It's a gross thing we have to a girl.  Some guy is saying you should just pop an implant in the other side and go with it.  Just go with it.  Just go with it.  How do you look at makeup?  Take the mic.  No, it wouldn't work.  Believe me, I've tried working out so much.  That's not working out, though.  You can tell it's something else.  Did you go to a doctor or anything?  Yeah, it's called...  Actually, the medical term is called gynoclycemia.  Gynoclycemia.  Yeah, that sounds hot.  And they said, like, one out of three guys got it. 
[01:41:00]  You don't get it, but...  One out of three?  That's what the guys told me.  That's not...  Those are some weird...  One out of three.  Let's see.  We've got how many guys in here right now?  Yeah, it doesn't make sense, but...  Somewhere in the room with, like, 40 guys in it with one boob.  Yeah.  Normally, like, chubby or obese men get it, but apparently...  He's really bummed about it.  I can tell.  Yeah, me too.  You can tell.  You're my last...  I mean, how tall are you?  I'm 6'1".  6'1".  You're only, what, 175, 180?  170.  Okay. 
[01:41:30]  And it's completely normal on the right side, and he's got almost a B boob on the left side.  Yeah.  There's an extra sadness to judge.  That's a real...  It's a real boob.  And you have no other fat on your body.  When you flip it around, it jiggles like a real woman's breast.  It's like a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  A boob.  I mean, the names I used to get, like, people used to call me, like, Phantom Nipple, Bubble  Boob.  Um...  Bubble Boob.  I was telling...  Betty Ford.  Kids are so cruel.  So I'd be half a wreck.  Some of my friends would, like, ask if, like, my friend got to... 
[01:42:00]  You know, if a girlfriend got to second base with me and stuff like that.  Yeah.  That's bad.  Yeah.  It's been torching.  It's like...  You know, I guess it's acceptable if you're, like, if you're fat, but, like...  When you're, like, skinny, did you gain some weight?  You put on about 40, 50 pounds.  That's what I did.  I have half a boob.  But how do you tell the calories to move to the right side of your chest?  You know what?  It just...  I don't know how that happened.  When you were heavier, was the other side, like, comparable?  This one just...  Like I said, it just started growing, like, right up to, like, 15, 16 years old. 
[01:42:30]  Just, like...  And, like, I was so embarrassed, I was afraid to tell anyone about that.  A time of your life where it really doesn't matter.  Yeah, exactly.  If you're in, sir, any self-esteem or things like that.  You're mid-teens.  It sucks.  Because you can't, like, you can't go to, like, you can't go to, like, a boardwalk  or, like, a pool and just take your shirt off without people.  People notice it.  Like, you know...  You felt jammed, didn't you?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like...  Shirts and skins.  Oh, no.  50-50 shot.  What's it going to be?  Oh, I'm skins again.  Yeah, well, I'll just take the F.  Thank you.  Just take the F.  I'll be outside smoking pot. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  With my shirt on.  Right.  It shouldn't help that I worked at a day camp, too, you know?  Like, where I was outside all day long.  Here's a guy that had the same thing as you.  Rob?  Yo, O&A, what's up?  What's up?  Yeah, I had it...  I got the operation done about a month ago.  And it happens to one out of four guys.  Where you get one boob?  Yeah, it's called a gyno...  Gynocomastia.  Gynocomastia, yeah.  That's what doctors are telling you to make you feel better.  One of the four men against this. 
[01:43:30]  Everyone's got it.  I had it.  My 300 doctor friends.  99% of those guys live on a small island off of Fiji.  Africa, yeah.  Fiji, Africa.  Fiji, Africa.  Did you have it on one boob, or did you have it on both?  Yeah, only on one side.  Really?  And I went to the doctor.  Insurance covered it.  Got it paid for.  How does it look like the other side, or is it like...  Right now, my chest is perfectly even.  I got no problem.  You want that.  You are so jealous right now. 
[01:44:00]  No, I can't.  You say, look, you know what?  I don't know how this contest is going to pan out, but keep close.  Make sure you get your number to Rick.  We've got to have a telethon or something, man.  I can't let this guy go home with one boob today.  I was there when he was passing CDs out.  When you guys...  Remember you unloading all the CDs here?  I was outside.  Maybe Dr. Pistone might be able to throw them out.  Please.  Since it's only half the job.  If I had the money, I would have done it years ago.  Really?  This is what we'll do.  It'll be a little humiliating, but in the end, you'll have a normal chest. 
[01:44:30]  That's fine.  We'll have you out on the corner, and you'll show everyone the one boob, and we'll have  like a pathetic sign.  Please help me, and then they'll donate.  A fundraiser.  We will get the money in one day.  It's five grand.  Five grand?  But he only needs one done, though.  Yeah, that's how much it costs.  For one?  Five grand.  It'd be cheaper to just get the other one put in.  Is this Dr. Good?  I mean...  Yeah, his name's Dr. Pistone.  He's out of Philadelphia.  He does this all the time.  No, he's really good, actually.  Dr. Gregory Pistone, P-I-S-T-O-N-E. 
[01:45:00]  His website's drpistone.com.  Also sponsoring this contest is goldenpalace.com.  Yeah.  Chance to win a trip to Hedonism 3 if you go to their website.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to go to Hedonism, take your shirt off, get some girls without  worrying about a boob?  I'm going to Europe in three weeks.  I'm going on a cruise.  How am I going to, like...  Yeah.  Believe me, I tried working out so much.  Like, what am I...  You know, stay on the starboard side of the boat.  You're not going to get rid of it no matter what you do. 
[01:45:30]  It has to be done surgically.  Yeah.  You beat me to it.  Oh.  Wait, is that yours?  That's all right.  At least over in Europe, your armpit will look like a chick's too, so that's good.  Hey, I got to go, boy.  All right.  Maybe you can make believe your left arm's broken and the sling will just kind of...  Oh.  ...have everything, you know?  Good camouflage.  A sling.  Sucks, man.  I'm going to be, like, all over the place and I can't even take my shirt off, you know?  We can't let him leave this place with one freaking chick for fortune.  Hook you up.  I'm not doing this to be, like... 
[01:46:00]  I mean, I'm big fans of the show, but I'm not doing this for attention.  It's just, like you said...  No, we can tell.  You're desperate here.  He really is desperate.  Is his pictures up yet?  I don't know.  I wanted to say, I am doing this for attention.  Yes, Frank Caliendo, rascals.  Well, I think you're the type of guy this contest really is all about.  It's, you know...  Hey, Tiny over there.  You know, you got some really major league yabos there.  That's a little Stevie with the Ds, yeah.  But, you know, you're a big guy also. 
[01:46:30]  Well, hey, I could do the sympathy thing, too, you know?  Oh, you can.  These things, I got fat because I had a brain tumor.  Is that what did it?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I got to tell you something.  Wait, the brain tumor gave you boobs?  Absolutely.  Let me explain.  During commercials, Ant, he's got...  There it is.  You should explain.  There it is.  I was going to try to...  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What is it?  That's one of the four greatest things on Earth.  He just framed...  He has a framed picture of his brain tumor that he wants to show off.  That is a nice frame, too. 
[01:47:00]  Look at that.  Yeah, it's silver.  It is.  That's great.  You should make copies of those and slip them into all the frames at the department stores.  Like, pop all the pictures of those good-looking families out and just pop your brain tumor  in every single frame.  Yeah.  That's actual size, too.  Is it?  That's the actual size of your brain tumor?  That was it, right?  That was a big tumor.  Now, where was that?  Like, straight in the middle.  Right in the middle of your head?  Yep.  Right in the middle of your head, front, back.  Where was it?  They went up through my nose to get it, so it was... 
[01:47:30]  Was it one of those pituitary ones?  Absolutely.  I just saw special on that on Discovery the other day.  I do watch Discovery in between downloading porno.  Yeah.  But I do occasionally get...  I saw that the other day, and they go through the nose and pull out the tumor.  And it also has something to do with giantism, making you a giant or something.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Did it squirt out any of those things that made you big?  Like your hands and...  No.  You're a big guy.  But it went to your boobs.  It went to your boobs, right?  One of the woos in right here. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, you got a bunt.  That's called a bunt.  Is it a bunt if it's on a guy?  Well, on a woman, it's a bunt because it's not quite belly, and it's not quite the other thing.  Right.  So it's called a bunt.  I guess you'd have a bach.  A bach.  Why not?  Call it a bach.  Hey, let's pass the picture on.  Here.  Here's little Stevie's tumor pictures.  Framed for your pleasure.  Hey, that's a nice tumor.  Can we put your tumor up on our website?  Can you autograph that first?  Sign it.  That is a great tumor. 
[01:48:30]  To O.P. Anthony with love.  Let's see what voice comes out of Frank Caliendo when he sees this picture.  There you go.  Frank, that's...  The doctor actually asked me if I was lactating.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Did it make him hot, or was it a professional question?  The only thing I could say to him was, excuse me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This kind of thing, man.  That's what it does to you.  Is there anything you could take?  Any hormonal treatment to get rid of your boobs?  Uh, no.  They are there now.  The only way to get rid of him is to have him surgically removed. 
[01:49:00]  That's why.  Oh, wow.  Brain tumor guy or a guy that's going to Europe and has one boob.  Let's not forget about the Asian guy.  He's not Asian, but he has the Asian lady boobs.  Yeah, but I don't think he's got a good sob story.  Hey, Rick, are these pictures going to be up soon so people can play along at home?  Yeah, real quick.  Scott's working on it right now.  All right.  Wow.  Proving that big breasts go hand-in-hand with brain dysfunctions, even in guys. 
[01:49:30]  You learn something new on the Open Rampers show.  Shandon.  Yeah, I heard that guy talking about how he had a job at a daycare center.  Oh, day camp.  Day camp.  Oh, day camp.  Kind of ruins your joke now.  Kind of ruins your joke now, doesn't it?  Yeah, it's bad.  That's sex.  Say what he say.  Especially since the doctor was asking him if he was lactating.  I was going to ask him if he was breastfeeding the kitties.  You're missing everything.  Got the wrong guy, works at the wrong place.  Here's a guy who should have listened to In Order. 
[01:50:00]  That's right.  Hey, this guy says he had the surgery done and insurance paid for half.  You got some insurance there?  I don't have medical insurance right now.  Oh, man.  You're working at the day camp.  No, right now I'm trying to get my teacher certification at Montclair State University.  The kids won't make much fun of a teacher with one boob, right?  I wonder if we can do Feels for Meals with this guy.  Feels to have it reduced.  Oh, man.  One of the greatest radio promotions that'll never be done, unfortunately. 
[01:50:30]  I couldn't believe you guys were talking about it.  I was like, oh, my God, and that's why I called up.  That's me.  Too bad Rachel isn't here today.  She could have given it a feel and said if it feels like a woman.  Have girls told you it feels like a real woman's boob?  Well, girls just get bugged out about it.  They don't like it.  They know I'm embarrassed about it, so they kind of don't talk about it.  But you know they're laughing so hard right now.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at C, the self-esteem problem. 
[01:51:00]  What if you're with a girl whose boobs are smaller?  Does that mean that?  That's sad.  I was telling them before, like, I went out with a girl.  She had, like, an A.  She was, I went out and said, like, A minus.  I went out with her.  But she had a nice body, like a stripper's body and everything.  But, yeah, my boob is bigger than hers.  You know, our listeners.  I told them, like, I'll give you mine, you know.  Yeah, well, if only you could do that.  I got to tell you guys one thing.  Our listeners listen a little more closely than we do.  Mitch picked up on something here.  Mitch.  Yeah.  Go ahead. 
[01:51:30]  I got a small issue with this guy.  All right.  Why are you going on a European cruise if you can't afford this surgery?  Oh, hey, man.  Where the hell were we?  Bing, bing, bing.  Where the hell were we?  Where's my barrel?  There it is.  Where were we thinking?  Hey, dude, how are you going on a cruise?  I'll explain.  All right.  He's going to have a good answer for this one.  That's fine.  My parents are from Greece.  So we're going to Greece.  It's my mom's 50th birthday present.  And they're paying, you know, I don't have the money.  I asked my parents if I could have this done.  But my mom's one of those, like, European, off-the-boat Greek mothers. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  Who, like, thinks, you know, her son's perfect no matter what.  You don't need that.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, I mean, I understand.  I know where he's coming from.  But, like, it's my mom's 50th thing.  Like, we're going to visit family there.  So, like, it's...  Oh, man.  That's the deal with that.  I've asked my parents, believe me, if I could get this done.  You know, I would have done this earlier.  Why would I wait until I'm 23 to get this done?  You know, I would have done it when I was 16, 17, 18 years old.  Man, I thought I had a good one.  You did.  You did, because I'm still thinking, you know, hey, Mom.  Mom.  Come on. 
[01:52:30]  I know.  Believe me, I would take the breast reduction over a cruise in a second.  I'd take the breast reduction over seeing my mom any day.  Say what?  I'll give you two grand if I can go on the cruise with your parents.  Go ahead.  All right.  There you go.  Look, you made out.  Party in Greece.  Is your mom hot?  Jeez.  You sell the cruise, send someone in lieu of you to stand in for your mom's 50th.  You don't, I don't even care.  I don't want to go.  I honestly wouldn't go.  If I could trade it up, hands down, I would take the surgery in a second. 
[01:53:00]  Well, we have your mother on line two.  Let's see what she has to say about that.  Do you want us to talk to your mom about this?  You wouldn't want to talk to her.  If she knew I was here, she'd flip out.  Oh, really?  She would flip out.  She doesn't listen?  But, hey, I'm over 18, so I can do whatever I want.  That's right.  Yeah.  And you've got to make that a priority in your life, getting rid of that.  It is.  Now, you know, I want to get it done now because.  You know what's going to happen?  Because you'll get older, you'll stay there, you'll get older and older, 
[01:53:30]  and then after a point, guys just say, you know something, screw it.  I don't even care anymore.  And you'll be around with a bit.  And believe me, just like a girl, they probably will sag.  Well, I just met this girl now, and I like her a lot,  but, like, I can't take my shirt off in front of her.  And I sat over at her house, and she was, like, kind of, like,  I can plan to take my shirt off.  Does she know you had the one boob, or have you been hiding it well?  I've been hiding it, but I don't know.  I think she's picking up on it a little bit.  Let's call her.  She's in Baltimore right now.  I don't care.  Maybe she can come see me at Fletcher's on Sunday night. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, Fletcher's in Baltimore.  Thank you very much.  Lounge against the machine.  I just had to slip a plug in.  It's been 20 minutes.  I found a guy who can plug himself better than Frank Caliendo.  Thank you.  You want us to call the girl?  We'll break it to her, nice.  Come on.  You got to tell her eventually.  Why not in front of everyone?  It'll break the ice.  We'll make it fun.  She's on vacation right now.  She's down at Ocean City Mall.  Does she have a cell phone?  You can get a hold of her, man.  I have her home line, but she's not home.  You'll get brownie points as far as us raising money for you. 
[01:54:30]  I can give you numbers to other girls that have gone out with me and see what they say.  Oh, yeah?  I mean, I don't know.  See what they're honest.  I mean, I'm trying to help you out.  See what their honest opinion of it was.  See what they said.  I know you can get a hold of your current girl.  She's got to know, man.  I've only went to like three weeks, and she's so hot.  She looks like Mandy Moore.  She's hot, this girl.  I don't want to ruin it.  I can give you the girl I went out with.  I can give you the girl I went out with in 1980.  What anxiety this guy must go through with a hot girl and just, like, it's always on 
[01:55:00]  his mind.  Oh, no, she's going to find out about the boob.  Oh, my God.  All right, I'm going over to pick her up, but, oh, my God, she's going to be tonight.  She's going to find out about the boob.  Oh, my God.  Just like constant anxiety about this.  Why do you wear a vest every time you pick me up?  Just wrap yourself up in a bandage.  I'm an investigator.  I was shot yesterday.  You know, just come up with macho stories while you need to be bandaged up.  I'm trying to see.  We want to talk to the current one, I think. 
[01:55:30]  Does it pop out when you get cold a little?  More sensitive than the other one?  Well, it actually is very, it kind of gets tender, like if you see.  Once a month?  You know, we've all heard that one.  Don't touch.  They're hurt.  I thought someone gave you.  It's tender.  When I first started, I thought someone just gave me a really bad purple nurple when I was a little kid, and that's what caused it.  I didn't know.  I thought it was like, let's call that guy who did that show.  Exactly.  Yeah, purple nurple guy.  All right, we have to take a break. 
[01:56:00]  We do have Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine in the studio.  They're playing the Mercury Lounge tomorrow night.  What?  Little Stevie?  You all right?  He dropped his frame.  Oh, you dropped your tumor?  Can we get that scanned and put up on the website?  All right, we're going to get the tumor on the website.  Hey, let's play Discovery Channel for them out there.  I think you'll like this one.  Oh.  You and me, baby, we ain't nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel. 
[01:56:30]  I saw a special about the pituitary gland on that Discovery.  Discovery Channel.  Thank you.  Very nice.  Now let's turn on the PA system and start the fun.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Afternoon radio, this is it.  You can't go anywhere else.  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth, you're leaving. 
[01:57:00]  Where are you going?  Opie and Anthony.  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, don't it?  Ah, Anthony, Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  Just looking at little Stevie's scrapbook.  Yeah.  Sam Adams.  I'm scared.  I love it.  Look what I'm drinking right now.  That would be Sam Adams.  Ice cold Sam Adams.  Ah, yes.  We love it.  Drink it all the time here at the show.  They've sent us 15 cases.  Yeah.  Which we put in our fridge and we love it after the show. 
[01:57:30]  We go and have an ice cold Sam Adams.  So if you're out having a great time, be in the Flatiron District or in Midtown Manhattan,  always make Sam Adams a part of your fun.  What is that supposed to mean?  I guess they're localizing it.  That's great.  So if you're watching The Naked Cowboy in Times Square, Sam Adams, they won all kinds of awards for their beer.  And Jim Cook, he's a master brewer.

Richard Cheese from Lounge Against the Machine playing the Mercury Lounge tomorrow night.  That's right. 
[01:58:30]  This is a great song.  This is Guns and Roses, isn't it?  Yeah, Paradise.  You know, we do a better version of that.  Bobby, can you hear me out there?  Swing it for me.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I said, take me down to that paradise city where the grass is green and those girls are  pretty.  Oh, won't you please take me home?  Take me home.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, take that guy home. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Wow.  That's the kind of top-notch musical entertainment we'll be seeing at the Mercury Lounge tomorrow night.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  Nice.  Thank you.  Hey, we got to talk about the Call Me Now lady.  Call me now.  Miss Cleo's in a little trouble there.  Miss Cleo.  Remember when those commercials first started running?  I want you to all remember what I said here on this radio show.  And I wasn't going out on a limb with this one either.  That's a bunch of crap, all that psychic stuff. 
[01:59:30]  Who are these people calling?  Pretty good.  No, please.  The master's over here and I'm trying to hack a Jerry Seinfeld impression.  What's the deal with that?  But, yeah, people call and it seems that their commercials said the first three minutes free.  Remember that?  So call me now for your free reading.  And people would call up and apparently they would leave you on hold for quite a while while  they found the psychic. 
[02:00:00]  And it was never Cleo.  Find the psychic.  Find the psychic.  We don't know where she is.  They knew Radio K.  Find the psychic.  So they'd put you on hold.  And then when they get you back on the line, they would say, Cleo's not here.  So you'd talk to some schlep that's in a cubicle somewhere that they dragged off the street.  And then they would get all your personal information.  Say, okay, I need your birthday.  I need this.  I need that.  Meanwhile, ching, ching.  There go the three minutes.  Gone.  Then they put you on hold again.  So people are being billed. 
[02:00:30]  They never get to use their free three minutes.  Right.  And I don't know what they could tell you in three minutes.  And they never get Miss Cleo.  No, you never get Miss Cleo.  Because they did a thing.  It's like a warehouse filled with Miss Cleo lookalikes.  Yeah.  I saw that on the Discovery Channel.  You and me.  Sorry.  Did that one.  It was right after the Brain Tumor Show.  The Discovery Channel, one of the most informative channels in the history of television.  Absolutely right.  Yes.  Thank you, Harv.  So the Attorney General here, Jay Nixon, this guy, said that they were ripping off people 
[02:01:00]  for millions of dollars.  So all of a sudden their commercials disappeared.  And now Miss Cleo is somewhere in the Caribbean.  Call me now.  Call Miss Cleo for your free reading.  Hi, Miss Cleo.  Yes.  Hi, Jay Nixon, Attorney General.  Okay, Jay, wait.  Let me lay my cards out and I'll give you your reading. 
[02:01:30]  No, Miss Cleo, I'm not calling about that.  Don't be telling Miss Cleo what you're calling about.  I'm the psychic.  Let me lay the cards out.  You say you're Attorney General.  Yeah, Miss Cleo, I'm the Attorney General.  Okay.  I see in your future you're going to make a big bust.  Yeah, Miss Cleo, that's why I'm calling.  Don't tell me nothing.  I'm a psychic.  I can tell you.  I see somebody be bilking lots of people out of their money. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, you are sharp, Miss Cleo.  Absolutely.  Why?  Me, Jay Nixon, Attorney General, I'm calling you.  Now, there's a problem with your relationship.  No, Miss Cleo, that's fine.  There's a problem with them, you.  I'm looking in my cards here.  Uh-oh, wait, Miss Cleo not here.  Hold on.  Please wait.  We'll get another psychic.  I have a plane to catch.  She's out of there.  At times she became Andrew Dice Cleo.  Andrew Dice Cleo. 
[02:02:30]  Miss Cleo, let me lay my cards out.  I see banana juice in your future, you effing hoo-er.  Oh!  Call me now, you dumbass.  Unless you're one of those disgusting midgets.  Now I'll do 20 minutes on midgets.  Oh!  Miss Cleo, why are the sirens outside me house? 
[02:03:00]  Tell me, what does she want to do?  Look for a lady with a really fake Jamaican accent, dressed like Aunt Jemima.  Be right outside.  Call me now.  Yes, I guess anybody who is calling that, wipe your drool off your mouth and you might have a lawsuit.  Sue me now.  Sue me now.  Yeah, call me.  I need bail.  Improper billing practices. 
[02:03:30]  Improper billing practices.  Yeah, well, I guess it would be because she billed some people who are dead.  Yeah.  Did you read that too?  Yeah.  They were billing phones of people that were dead.  They were dead.  Like to try to, I guess, get money from their estate.  I see in your future you have no future.  You're dead.  I see your flesh rotting off your body.  I got billed 12 times.  You're a good lord.  I was billed too.  It wasn't fair. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, I got billed four times.  I loved it.  Speaking of getting billed.  I don't have a predicate to that, sir.  A predicate.  Call me now if you're dead.  Yeah.  So we won't be seeing her anymore.  I enjoyed those late nights.  I liked the Miss Cleo.  She was all right.  She was just a figurehead.  I was like an hour last night or two nights ago.  Miss Cleo?  Two nights ago.  Wow, because I haven't seen her in a while on the commercials.  Her infomercial's still playing, though. 
[02:04:30]  She's now Kevin Trudeau.  Is that who she is now?  The memory guy.  Oh, thanks.  Everybody got silent.  I was like, I suck.  He's the memory guy.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, Joe.  I hate to interrupt the phone, but I believe Miss Cleo invented to call me now.  Anyway, I was wondering if my girlfriend's cheating on me.  You're wondering that what?  If my girlfriend's cheating on me.  Okay, hold on.  We're not done with your free read in three minutes yet.  So please hold three minutes. 
[02:05:00]  Music, please.  Music hold.  Yeah, anytime somebody would call on the commercials, this is something I like, too.  They'd be like, hi, Cleo.  I'm in a relationship, and I want to know, is my boyfriend cheating on me?  Ah, he is cheating on your girl.  But let me tell you, you've been seeing a man yourself.  Yeah, I have.  See, you'll be calling on your boyfriend.  You should be calling on yourself.  Call me now for a free read.  And she's like, wow, Miss Cleo.  The most badly scripted phone calls. 
[02:05:30]  Miss Cleo, I was wondering what kind of donut I could get.  She's looking at a bunch of different kinds of donuts.  There's so many donuts.  You got any ideas, Miss Cleo?  In case you do, just tell me.  You've been giving the donut lady a hard time, haven't you?  Well, I do the sound effect when I come in the door.  Cling, cling.  Oh, that was the one I saw.  The one when she was on the fake radio show.  Yeah, oh, the fake radio show is one of the staples of the bad infomercials now. 
[02:06:00]  They just throw a mic in front of her and go, let me tell you how you can make yourself a fortune in a week.  And then they have some real estate thing.  And I'm watching this going, you know, who the hell is going to listen to this show?  I don't even think they're really on the radio when they're doing that.  Frank, comment.  Thank you very much.  Hey, Matt, what's up?  I'm Seymour.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is this O&A?  Yes, it is.  Oh, good.  Yo, I used to work for Miss Cleo.  You were one of the psychics. 
[02:06:30]  I was one of the psychics.  I was hired by some fat ladies who worked for Miss Cleo.  I basically got paid, like, eight bucks off the books to come sit in there and listen to, like, people's files and stuff like that.  Eight bucks per call?  Well, this is the thing.  Like, the whole scam is to keep them on the phone for as long as possible, you know?  Yeah, that's pretty obvious.  Sure.  So they come up, you know, they call up and, like, they start talking to you.  They'll be like, is Miss Cleo there?  And you got to be like, I was always like, nah, she's not here.  You know, like, you can talk to me.  Some people say that.  I saw the show.  Some people say that, oh, she's doing another reading. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, you do something like that.  It'd be like two o'clock in the morning.  Do you really think you're getting in touch with Miss Cleo?  I could really use some sleep.  I'm here all the time.  Yeah, she's not there.  Yeah, I know.  So, like, you know, you just keep them on the phone.  And, like, there's a whole script.  They'll start telling you about the palms and stuff like that.  All right, here we go.  I just called you up.  You're the psychic.  I go, hi, I'm here for my psychic reading.  All right.  What seems to be, like, on your mind today?  I want to know about relationships.  No, this is exactly how it goes. 
[02:07:30]  No, this is exactly how it goes.  It's really bad.  But you don't even throw in the Jamaican accent?  No, man.  I just smoke a big fat joint.  Go up there.  That's what I would do.  So, all right, I want to know about relationships.  Relationships?  All right.  I just laid out the card for you.  And I see a tree of hearts here or something like that.  I forgot what they exactly are.  A tree of hearts or something like that.  Hey, look, I got blackjack.  Yeah.  Phase two to one.  Double down.  You want to double down on your down? 
[02:08:00]  Double down.  I got the card of cups here and the, oh, the death card.  Yeah, basically.  And then you just be like, so, like, I see there's a problem in, like, your relationship going on right now.  And anybody who has a stable relationship would not be calling a stupid psychic.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I do have a problem.  You're right.  Yeah, basically, like, all they do is, like, they talk you through it.  And it's, like, the longer you keep them on the phone, like, you know what I mean?  Like, the more money you make.  Because it's just, like, you know, like, it's, like, lonely people calling up in the middle of the night.  You know, they want to hear somebody talk to them and stuff like that. 
[02:08:30]  You become, like, a psychologist.  Like, am I going to find a true love?  Matt, tell me now.  Of course you will.  Oh, was it always positive?  Of course you will.  Well, it depends.  It depends on my mood.  Sometimes I'd be, like, real evil and stuff like that.  Oh, you'd be pissed off and you'd get up there and just go, you're going to die and a fire and crash.  Oh, man.  I just found my side gig.  Yeah, I hope you can do that, man.  You go in there, like, tell, like, girls her husband are cheating on them and stuff like that.  You can make a mess with people's, like, relationships because they believe it. 
[02:09:00]  And then you can pick up the broad.  Yeah.  To say that he's cheating on you or something.  Yeah, you can make stuff up.  You can just go off.  But I'm telling you, man, that whole thing, it was just, like, ridiculous.  And you worked for the Ms. Cleo one.  Yeah, totally.  See, who were the rooves calling that number?  It was.  That's all it was.  In the middle of the night, I used to work, like, late shift, like, for maybe, like, 11 o'clock to about, like, 2.30, 3 o'clock.  And people would just call up with just, like, you know, crying and stuff like that.  Talking about, like, their diseases and stuff like that. 
[02:09:30]  Is someone going to die?  Wow, what if a brain tumor guy called up?  Oh, a brain tumor guy would be, like, dead if I was in the right room.  Hey, Jay's in.  Jay, you work with...  Matt!  Jay.  Yeah.  Can you hear Matt?  Nah.  I hear Jay.  Matt, what's up, man?  You can work with Jay.  Yo, Jay!  Matt, it's Jay.  Matt, Jay, Matt!  What's up?  Yeah, you can work with him.  Jay!  Yo!  You know what I ruled? 
[02:10:00]  You want to smoke some more weed?  Jay!  Hey, Jay!  What's up?  You worked at the...  Hold on, hold on.  Jay, you've got to watch that F word.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  But you worked, and you were a psychic, too.  Yeah, I just feel like...  I see love in your future.  You're going to have good times in the future.  You're going to get some money coming to you.  It's going to be great.  Business opportunities.  It was ridiculous.  How did you get the job?  Like, what...  Did they ask any qualifications?  No, we had a studio, and it was, like, a couple doors down, and we just walked over,  and she's like, you guys want to be psychics? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, this big fat lady was like...  The big fat lady asked us, do you want to be a psychic?  She was the real thing, and we were like, all right, let's go.  What was the training they gave you?  And then she just kicked out of town, and she left without paying people.  What was the training they gave you to read the cards?  To give you, like, a...  We never even had cards.  You didn't have the cards?  We had a script.  No.  I thought maybe they'd have the cards and just go, all right, here's the cups of...  A card of cups and the...  Yeah, there's a script to keep going, and, like, the script was, like, perfectly timed out  to keep them on the phone for an hour. 
[02:11:00]  That was ridiculous.  And then, like, after, like...  She was hiring just a bunch of stoners.  I didn't mean, hey, dude!  You want to be a psychic?  Yo, another funny thing...  Another funny thing was, dude...  What the hell?  Why?  Like, after, like, a couple minutes, a beep would happen, and they'd be like, what's  that beep?  And that was the beep when, like, the free time was up, and we'd be like, oh, that's  nothing.  Don't worry about that.  Don't mind the beep.  Don't worry about that, man.  We would take breaks and just drink 40s.  It didn't matter.  Drink 40s and smoke pot. 
[02:11:30]  Help people with their future.  We still, like, mold people's lives.  I'd be like, I see...  I think your husband's cheating on you, so you should go to the Caribbean and meet, like,  a new love.  I'd be like, you're right!  You guys rock.  Wow.  Stone guys, reading your future.  Call me now.  Go, man.  You can't write a bit better than...  Yeah, yeah.  You have fun.  Fuck's fun.  All right, Jay, Matt.  All right, man.  See you later, guys.  Thanks, guys.  There they go.  We eat every day.  Yes.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Travis, what's going on?  Yo, O&A.  Hey.  I hear Don West is replacing Chloe on the old... 
[02:12:00]  Cleo, no.  Miss Cleo.  Limited edition.  I got your future.  I got your future.  It's in the cards.  Let me open up the cards here.  I got a Ken Griffey Jr. rookie card.  I don't know about you, but I know it's in my future.  I'm going to sell this thing.  I'm going to sell it.  Give it three minutes on the clock.  Three free minutes on the clock.  And call me now.  Call me now.  Because look at this. 
[02:12:30]  I'm going to give you a box set.  You start your own card store.  Start your own store with the collection we got coming up now.  Look at this.  A McGuire rookie card.  You can't beat it.  Call me now, folks.  I'll predict your future.  You're going to spend a lot of money on worthless sports memorabilia, if you call me.  You ever see that lunatic?  At night?  Late night?  He's great.  It's more fun watching you, my friend. 
[02:13:00]  It's in the cards.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, O'Neill.  What's up?  What's up?  We're having fun, man.  Yeah, me and my friend's up at school.  We went to go prank Miss Cleo.  We got one of her henchmen.  Prank Miss Cleo.  She's getting paid for your prank.  She's got to figure it out.  You can't prank her.  No, yeah, but I got one of her henchmen.  And so he started to ask me questions.  They asked me where I'm from.  I told him I was from Jersey City.  So for ten minutes, he's telling me about how he was in Jersey City the night before they bombed the World Trade Center bombing. 
[02:13:30]  And I'm like, dude, I don't care.  I just want to talk to Miss Cleo.  And he just kept going on and on about how he's like, that was pretty scary.  Here's a guy who doesn't know he was getting the tricks.  Yeah.  Yeah, then I got a bill for $25.  Good trick.  You got her.  Yeah, I know.  Mike, why don't you prank the 1-900 numbers or something?  Why Miss Cleo?  Because she's the biggest tool on TV.  I always hear her all the time.  I just wanted to yell at her.  All the stoners checking out the Miss Cleo commercials late at night.  Wow.  Just laughing. 
[02:14:00]  I could do that.  Yeah, you could.  Watch me mess with her mind for the next hour.  It gets the phone bill.  I'm so much more intelligent than her.  Right.  Dude, we screwed her for an hour.  She is such a dick.  I guess we have to take a break.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Here, are the man boob pictures up today?  Scott's got a few of them up right now.  A few?  Do we got the one boob guy yet?  Yeah, he was the first one.  Go to opiandanthony.com.

Richard Cheese has setups like you for me, Ope.  I know.  I know.  What do you do?  How about a little U2?  Is it getting better? 
[02:15:30]  Or do you feel the same?  Will it make it easier?  If you got someone to blame, cause it's one boob on that guy.  One boob, not my guy.  One.  But it's not the same as the other one with what's-his-name, yeah.

If you see a guy with wow written on the back of their car, that means...  We've actually seen a few of them.  Cool.  There you go.  They're in Cleveland.  The wow stickers are hidden in Cleveland.  If you're feeling it, show your boobs, all right?  All right.  The guys will be cool to you back.  All right.  I promise.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Pat checking in saying he loved the new Lou Reed song.  Jamie.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, Jamie.  You've got to help this guy out. 
[02:21:00]  What, the one-boom guy?  You've got to help him out.  I had the surgery done.  You've got to help him out.  Oh, wait.  The pictures have finally made it up, right?  They're on already.  Oh, that's right.  We did talk about that.  Yeah, they're on.  Now there's so much going on.  I forgot.  No offense to the other guys, but this guy needs it.  Yeah, the one-boom.  I mean, you look at him and stuff.  You'll help his future so much.  It's going to be up to you guys.  I mean, I feel bad for the Asian, the guy with the Asian lady boob.  Well, there's some guys that the boob job, if they win and go and get it done and don't 
[02:21:30]  have the boob, it's not going to help them at all.  You could tell.  They're just maybe real big fat guys and the boob thing isn't going to help them at all.  But that's somebody that if he has that one boob removed, I think it'll help out his life.  Definitely.  I went through this when I was in like eighth grade.  I was going to all eighth grade summer parties and I was the only moron with a shirt on.  Yeah.  You've got to help this guy.  It's going to be up to you guys.  You're going to vote eventually.  I'll vote a thousand times for him.  All right, Jamie.  All right.  Tomorrow's the last day to qualify for the man-boob contest because we can't take any more of this. 
[02:22:00]  There's something important about symmetry, though, isn't there?  Yeah.  You've got one.  It's almost like easier if there's two.  You've got the belly.  The one, though.  It's like just the one nice, supple, whatever.  Frank, wake up.  Hey.  Come back to reality.  Richard Cheese is here.  Thank you very much.  He's going to do a song for us in a little bit.  There's another guy that came and he wants in on the contest, though. 
[02:22:30]  Hmm.  What does he look like?  Oh, I saw this guy.  Maybe he's got the other boob.  You go to opieandanthony.com to see all the contestants for the man-boob contest.  There we go.  One of the NSYNC guys.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing, man?  Pretty good.  Hey, you look like you should be an NSYNC or something.  Oh, no.  Not the NSYNC.  You know how you 12-year-old to 16-year-old girls tell me that?  Really?  I'm right out of NSYNC.  Hey, look what you do.  You've got Britney Spears boobs.  That's a nice little combination you've got.  Of course, in the pop-land.  So, uh, take your shirt off. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, God.  Take your shirt off.  Just so sweet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More like Christina Aguilera boobs.  The hair helps a little bit.  Yeah.  You know, that kind of takes away from the womanly.  Thing that was happening with the other guy that didn't have any hair.  Those are pretty bad, too, Anthony.  Those are pretty bad.  But he's got two.  Yeah.  That's true.  Side view.  Yeah, turn it sideways.  Oh, my God.  You've got, like, crack whore boobs.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Crack whore.  Complete with the hair.  When did you have the baby?  Crack whore?  Crack whore.  When did you have the baby?  About a week ago, maybe.  More in it.  Man.  So, when did those perk up?  Seventh grade.  Seventh grade.  Yeah.  I don't mean to stare at your breasts.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  It's seventh grade.  This is freaking bizarre.  And how much did you weigh at the time?  Were you, like, fat or anything?  Probably about the same build I am now.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you got boobs.  Yep.  Nothing I could do.  See, this is another guy that would really benefit from the surgery. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  You know, because you're not a huge fat guy, right?  Because you can go back to being an in-sync.  Yeah.  No strings attached.  All right.  Put your shirt on.  I know you're embarrassed.  What is that?  My God.  What's the No Strings Attached?  That was their album.  That was their last album.  Oh, you know that, Faggy?  I know a lot about him.  I was wishing I actually knew what his name was, the guy he looks like.  Oh, sure.  But you didn't memorize it off the poster in your room?  I guess that's it. 
[02:24:30]  Guilty as charged.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Now, that's the running gag around here.  If anyone knows anything about in-sync or one of the other boy bands.  Here you want it.  Is that the set?  Yes, it is.  It's the back street boy.  Frank, here's the in-sync CD.  And I look like the rest of them.  That would be...  Wow, I don't know.  The second one on the line.  No, who we know is Gay Marco.  Oh, the second one?  Why, you get that a lot? 
[02:25:00]  I'm looking at the guy here.  He looks like the second one on the album.  It's the second guy.  Do they have their names inside?  Yeah.  You know who that is.  Who is it?  Oh, it's Lance.  How do you know, Ben?  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah, blah, blah, blah, whatever he had said to me.  Whatever he said to me goes to you, dude.  No matter necessary.  Yeah, I think you could be a favorite in the contest.  I think you'll get some votes.  Your pictures have been taken? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, they'll be up on the website.  Did Rick make you do the shot where you lean against the wall and look over your shoulder?  No.  I didn't get that lucky.  Good, man.  I didn't have to do the cup shot, though.  Oh, really?  I didn't have to cup it up and like...  He made you cup it up?  What is he doing?  There's supposed to be clinical front side shots from Rick.  Rick is the weirdest human.  He really is.  He had one guy pushing him with like his biceps, like pushing them together.  Yeah, I did that, too.  He was like pushing them.  What is he?  He's doing the two where he makes one big one? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like pushes them in the middle.  I saw him walking through the hallway with some clothespins.  We've got a lot of funny people here today.  Kurt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to know what Newman from Seinfeld thinks about the man boobs since, you know,  he is in the studio today.  And, yeah, he has some man boobs, right?  Newman always sporting the man boobs.  Hmm.  Newman's got nothing.  Oh, is that a cue, guys?  Thank you.  Maybe I'm too gay. 
[02:26:30]  Maybe I'm not right for the show anymore, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, no.  He's pulling a Cindy Williams on us.  I'm kidding.  It's like, cover your ass quickly, Frank.  Sea rat race.  What was the question?  I forgot.  Is he in that?  Newman, he wanted you to comment about this guy's man boobs.  That's all.  Supple, wonderful, squeezable, like sharp.  Newman. 
[02:27:00]  What's the deal with Newman?  He's going gay on us.  I'll show you gay, Jay.  He knows all the in-sick guys.  Vicki, what's going on?  Dude, I want to be on the air.  You're on the air, but you got to turn on your radio.  We got a lot of stone people listening.  Is that better?  Dude.  No, usually we like it off.  Oh, man.  Yeah, because it echoes.  Now I hear Frank in the background doing his Newman. 
[02:27:30]  Is that better?  Because it echoes.  Yeah.  What do you got, Vicki?  Dude.  Contestant number nine is hot.  You have to totally give him, you have to give him that procedure.  Which one's number nine?  Roll for something.  Wait, go to the...  You mean the guy with the one boob?  Brain tumor?  Oh, Jesus.  Which one's number nine?  I hate when girls call on him, like, he's so hot.  No, but he's so cute, dude.  Oh, Rolf?  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  I got a feeling that they...  Oh, Rolf is the guy with the Asian lady boob.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel bad for him.  Let's get to the female point of view here.  It's going to be very different.  It really is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because men and women are different.  Well, no, I like women, too.  Vicki.  You think, oh, man.  Yeah.  Now, you think this guy's hot, right?  Yeah.  Now, you go back to his place, and you're getting ready to do a deed, and he takes his  shirt off.  What are you thinking when you see the Asian lady boobs? 
[02:28:30]  Okay, it's so not cool.  But, I mean, I...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Yeah, you can't say the T word for boobies.  No.  Okay, can I say boobs?  So you like boobs, too?  Yeah, boobs are nice.  Wait, hold on.  Go back to that last shot.  Hey, Rick, you're out of your mind.  Look, that's the shot.  Who is that?  Little Stevie?  He made Little Stevie with the huge D man boobs?  Yeah.  Hold one up and cup it.  Look at that.  Rick, why are you doing that?  Just to show how big it is.  You know what?  I'm on Rick's side today, because... 
[02:29:00]  Come on, that's funny stuff.  That's a pretty funny stuff.  He's holding it up like, wow, those are huge.  Want some?  Yeah, I want some.  Like in those magazines, like the real bad ones, the swanks and the whatnot, where the  chick is holding it up, and he's got that look on her face like, yeah, get some.  They're holding it up, and it's like mercury.  Trying to hold mercury in your hand.  Right, he's trying to keep it all dripping off the sides. 
[02:29:30]  Well, Vicki, we'll see what happens in the contest, all right?  All right, dude, you guys rock.  Right on, sister.  All right.  Yeah, another one of these.  Smoke weed every day.  Lots of that today.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Yeah.  Marijuana is the bomb.  You like those, right?  We have a couple.  But he contradicts himself, because he says it's the bomb.  Marijuana is the bomb.  And then he says this. 
[02:30:00]  Marijuana is a narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good, and does everybody a lot of harm.  Joe Friday's full of contradiction.  Let's check in with Sacramento today.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys doing, man?  I just want to let you guys know, I think you're the most hilarious couple of guys on the radio.  Oh, great.  We really needed something like you guys out here in Sacramento.  Thanks.  It takes a couple more than a couple of guys, though.  We got a whole crew, but thank you.  Yeah, I got to run, but you guys keep up the good work, and I'm spreading the word, man.  You guys are spreading like a virus out here. 
[02:30:30]  That's right.  You know, we're in a lot of cities, but our favorite radio station as far as call letters go, the one in Sacramento.  Yeah, it's Holy Smokes, it's 93 Rock.  No, it's K-X-O-A.  K-X-R-Q, there we go.  X-O-A.  We like the O-A part, K-X-O-A.  X-O-A.  They did say that you've got to stress the X.  I love it, love all the stuff you guys do.  Thanks, Mark.  Oh, man, it was hilarious yesterday.  Jay Moore sounded like he was going to wet his pants.  Yeah.  That's a fine line.  Hey, what do you think of Richard Cheese? 
[02:31:00]  Okay, thank you.  Richard Cheese.  Oh, yeah, they better have got that down the hall.  Thank you, Mark.  I want T-shirts from that station, because it's cool.  Because it has the O-A thing.  K-X-O-A.  K-X-Stream O-A.  That's right.  Richard, you want to do another one?  I would love to, with your permission.  We'd like to do a classic number.  Well, I want to give the plug.  RichardCheese.com.  A lot of people asking where they could get the CD lounge against the machine.  Yeah, you can buy it in record stores, anywhere music is sold, anywhere in the United States.  Or go to the website, RichardCheese.com. 
[02:31:30]  That's www.me.com.  And the CD's on sale.  And we're also going to be selling it at the show tomorrow night at the Mercury Lounge in New York City.  We're going to be in Baltimore and D.C., that area, on Sunday night at Fletcher's.  And we'll be staying at the Marriott in Fells Point.  Cha-ching!  I just got a free room.  Thank you.  I'm heading out to sing with the band.  Okay.  I think they're going to do Stairway to Heaven.  Oh, really?  This is supposedly pretty good.  Let's take it out.  Yeah.  Can you hear me, baby? 
[02:32:00]  Yes.  This is a classic number.  It's about a woman who's trying to purchase something to get from down here and up there.  You know what, Bobby?  What do you say we swing it today?  Yeah!  There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.  When she gets there, she knows those stores may be closed. 
[02:32:30]  With one word, she can get what she came for.  Ooh, scooby-dooby-doo-doo-doo.  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  When she gets there, she knows those stores may be closed.  But she can get what she came for.  The tree, the brook, the songbird singing.  All of it's all time it's given.  Oh, it makes me wonder.  I said, oh, and hey, it makes me wonder. 
[02:33:00]  But he coulda on the drums.  If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now.  It's just a sprinkling for the May Queen.  Hey, there are two paths you can't go by, but in the long run,  There's still time to change that road you're on.  Bobby, we're gonna change that road for us.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  And as we wind on down that road,  Our shadows are taller than those soul schools. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, there's that chick that we all know.  She's shining white light and wants to show.  And if you listen very hard,  The tune will come to you at last  And if all her work will go on  Won't you be a rock and learn how to roll  Won't you roll  And she's buying a stairway! 
[02:34:30]  To heaven.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, lounge against the machine.  Very nice, Richard.  Thank you very much.  Very nice.  Thanks, Opie.  Thanks, Anthony.  Thank you all. 
[02:35:00]  No, thank you.  Thank you.  No, thank you.  No, really.  What did I say about thanking you?  Thank you.  That's enough of that crap.  Okay.  Thank you, Marv.  All right, Stevie.  Yes.  What's up?  You said you need to know about NSYNC.  What do you need to know?  Let me think.  Everything.  Like what?  I don't think there's anything I need to know about NSYNC.  Yeah.  Stevie, what are you, an NSYNC fan?  Yes.  How old the guy are you? 
[02:35:30]  A girl.  Oh.  You sounded like a young boy.  Oh, dear.  I love young boys, William.  Wow!  Hey, once again, this show going awry.  Yes.  Oh, I thought you were a boy.  Yes, I know.  A lot of people do.  What, are you smoking the cigarettes there, Stevie?  No.  You got that voice that is going to be hot in like a week.  No, in a few years.  So did you pick up the new NSYNC album there, Stevie? 
[02:36:00]  Not yet.  No?  Why not?  Because I haven't gotten a chance to.  Oh.  Can you imagine being NSYNC?  This is what they have to deal with every day.  Yeah.  You know they want to get laid like any other guy.  It's like, oh, yeah, we're going to go out and get some chicks.  Oh, there's one on the phone right now.  Hold on.  Let me talk to her.  Hey, Stevie, how are you doing?  I'm fine.  Oh, Jesus.  No, that's it.  Great, great.  Great. 
[02:36:30]  No wonder one of the Backstreet Boys is in rehab.  Imagine that.  Yeah.  You can't take it anymore.  You've got to drink and take some dope in order to deal with that whole thing.  I've got a bunch of chicks and they dig me and they're 13 years old.  Right.  And she called me a recess.  Right.  All right, Stevie.  Opie.  What?  Get hot.  13.  Yeah.  Opie now knows NSYNC's hell.  What are you doing?  Opie, work it, man.  Work your pin pan.  Well, do you at least look 16?  You like ice cream? 
[02:37:00]  Thank you, Stevie.  Offer her some candy.  What are you, crazy?  That's funny, right?  All right, good.  Ass man.  Wow.  Ass man.  How you doing, guys?  What's up?  I'm kind of jealous now.  My pictures didn't come out all right.  I want to retake my pictures.  God, you even sound fat.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Come on, guys.  Give me a break.  Resonating in his gullet.  You can hear the fat in it.  Yeah.  You're 510 pounds, ass man.  Yes, I am.  Ass man can't stay down with three barrels in him. 
[02:37:30]  Not with three.  I'm not going to allow you to cut this ass man on the tail to let the little duck get  into bed.  Sorry.  You know, that would have worked...  What on earth is that?  That would have worked real well if you put down the sub before you tried that.  Yeah, the words were trying to squeeze it away around a chicken leg.  What's going on with the ass man?  Ass man weighs 510 pounds.  That's a lot of ass.  And ass man showed our intern, the lovely Rachel, his junk. 
[02:38:00]  The other things.  Actually pulled down his pants to reveal his junk.  What she saw horrified her.  Horrified her.  She stepped back, screamed, and then described what she saw.  It was one big mass of stuff.  It's like the yam bag.  Get this.  Just the yam bag.  You know when you take a water balloon and there's too much water in it and you hold  it by the knot, but wrinkled like an elephant skin. 
[02:38:30]  Right, right, right.  And in like somewhere between where it's attached and the end of it was like an opening.  Keep painting this picture.  Where the actual unit is.  But it wasn't poking out.  It wasn't poking out.  It was so embedded in the fat.  Like a frightened turtle.  Right.  Exactly.  Like a frightened turtle.  You want to hear the reaction?  We got the audio.  Do we?  When the ass man pulled down his pants for baby rah-rah.  I think this picks up right where he starts. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  Baby Ray-ray.  Baby Ray-ray.  I say rah-rah.  You say ray-ray.  Let's call the whole thing off.  Say it's Richard.  Richard.  Richard.  Let's go.  We understand that it's not worked up.  Kind of shy.  That's right.  Just let her rip.  Let her rip.  There you go.  I won't tell anybody.  Let her rip.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Guys, I must warn you again. 
[02:39:30]  You might not want to go into this area.  Not well.  I gave you this warning before.  Rachel will let us know.  After those armpits, I think I can handle anything.  Right.  Rachel will let us know.  And Rook will be sitting right next to me, watching with me.  No, I'm not.  Absolutely.  All right, Rachel.  Lift up that mic so we get your nice reaction live on the air.  Ass man.  Are you ready?  This is for Kathy.  Who's still on the line.  She's interested in maybe dating you.  She's still on the line?  Yeah.  510 pounds.  She hasn't given up yet.  Come on, Ass man. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Oh.  Do we really have to go down this road?  Please, guys.  I'm asking you.  I don't want to go down this road.  Come on.  Drop your hands.  There's no cameras.  I swear.  We wouldn't do that here.  Just go.  No cameras.  Get out of here, Rich.  All right.  I will look away.  I will avert my eyes.  You have to watch with me, Rick.  You have to watch with me, Rick.  Rick, you haven't watched with me, Rick.  Rick, you haven't watched with me.  The band is utterly disgusted.  And Rachel, you've got a very beautiful girl now wanting to see your junk, and you're 
[02:40:30]  beating around the bush.  I'm doing it for Kathy, man.  I'm doing it for Kathy, man.  I'm doing it for Kathy.  That's right.  You're helping out.  Come on, Kathy.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm tired of the women.  Here is...  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  No, you've got to, like, move away.  Move away.  Let her see.  Her stomach just fell.  Don't do it.  Don't do it all shy-like.  Just show her.  Whatever you've got to do.  Do it.  One, two, three.  Just let her see.  Give a quick three count.  We will give you another plug for your website. 
[02:41:00]  How's that?  Just quickly.  All right.  Here we go.  The pants are down.  Now I just got to put the shirt on.  Now let her...  Make sure she sees everything.  Lift the belly.  Lift the belly.  Lift the belly.  Lift the belly.  Lift the belly.  Here we go.  I don't see anything right now.  I still don't see anything right now.  He lifted the belly and you didn't see anything?  Nothing.  I didn't see anything.  He lifted the belly three feet up in the air.  Come on.  Come on.  What's the matter, Ass-Man?  What happened there?  Come on.  One more time.  It's tucked down somewhere. 
[02:41:30]  All right, Rachel, get on the floor.  You need a better angle.  Yeah, get down.  Yeah, Rachel, get down on the floor.  No, but see, the thing is, is that the elastic is holding it down.  Oh, you aren't showing.  You're going to...  Ass-Man, you've got to go the distance here.  Come on, Ass-Man.  You want to be on our show.  It'll be over in a second.  You want to be on our show.  This is it.  I know.  All right, get on the floor.  Rachel, get on the floor.  I am on the floor.  Get on your knees, Rachel.  Rachel, on her knees, right in front of Ass-Man.  Pull those way down.  Pull that up now.  Let her see.  Oh, God. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at her face.  What, Ben?  I designed it.  Rachel.  Oh, my God.  Rachel.  I'm confused.  Rachel, now, if we are all blind men, you have to now do your best to paint a picture.  What did you just say?  Honestly, the first thing that came to my mind was, I thought it was, like, that's not...  What did you say?  Well, it just looked like flaps of skin. 
[02:42:30]  I mean, I could probably draw for you.  It looked kind of like a...  Okay, draw it.  I mean, no offense, but it kind of reminded me of, like, women's junk.  Oh, no!  Oh, women's junk.  That was her reaction.  It looks like women's junk.  There's so much stuff there that it just folded everything else in, and he's left with, um...  Ass-Man?  With, uh, women's parts.  Ass-Man?  Yep.  There you go.  You're humiliated again.  You're not getting your pictures redone.  Okay, no problem.  All right. 
[02:43:00]  Let's go ahead.  Bye.  There he goes, Ass-Man.  There he goes to find an oven big enough to stick his fat head in.  To, uh, kill himself after that humiliation.  We're gonna finish, uh, the show next as we go to break here.  It's more Lounge Against the Machine.  It's a little number by a band called Blink 182.  I took her out.  It was a Friday night.  I walk alone to get the feeling right.  We started making out, and she took off my pants. 
[02:43:30]  That's when I turned on the TV.  And that's about the times you're away from me.  Nobody likes it when you're 23.  And I'm still more amused by a prank.  Don't call.  What the heck is my friend said I should act my age.  What's my age again?  What's my age again?  Cha-cha-cha.  Thank you.  You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now.

Sometimes it takes time.  Also, Frank Caliendo, thank you.  It's always a pleasure. 
[02:46:00]  Thank you guys for having me.  I think he's going to come back tomorrow for a little while, Anthony.  Nice.  He's going to be playing Rascals Friday and Saturday.  Nice.  Nice.  Did Al Pacino have fun today?  I had a lot of fun.  Let me tell you something, son.  I sat here for a little while.  The men came in and they had boobs.  I was going to say the T-word, but you can't say it.  Let me explain something to you.  When I'm looking at a boob on a man, I start to think to myself, I like women.  Yeah.  But this man looks good, especially if he's shaved. 
[02:46:30]  Does that make sense?  Yeah, it does make sense.  Because some of them had the hairy man boobs.  Hairy man boobs.  Your mind's looking at this crap trying to figure it all out, you know?  Do you find the hairless man boobs more attractive than the hairy ones?  Here's a question you can't win answering.  And I will never answer that.  But I think you understand what I'm saying.  When a guy comes in here with D-boobs and they're hairy on top of it, it's just hello.  I like to call it the woolly mammoth. 
[02:47:00]  A couple of them.  They travel in herds.  Donna has a good instant feedback here.  Let me see.  Donna from Jersey.  Hey, guys, if you ask me, Rick is enjoying this man boob contest too much.  He's posing them the same way he poses the hot chicks that come on your show.  Yeah.  He's making the guys hold their breasts up in the air and stuff.  It's hot.  Puffing them.  Rick, comment.  Is there musical man boob chairs coming up?  It's hot, man.  It's hot.  It's hot.  Hakuta Matata.  Means no worries.  Rick's here with his camera. 
[02:47:30]  To make up for today's show, we are going to need a daisy chain of lesbian girls on the floor for four straight hours tomorrow just munching.  Well, unfortunately, we've got more guys coming down with their man boob.  But if there's some hot ladies who want to come down and, you know, join the party, we'd love to have them.  Even the scales a little bit.  Comparisons.  Man to male to female.  Oh, that's good.  Okay, we need a girl with every bra size.  A matching boob from one girl to one guy. 
[02:48:00]  Right.  We need a, we need a, and then they need a touch.  What?  Yeah, we need a girl with every cup size down here just to compare.  Just one girl with every cup size.  That's the amazing part.  That's the weird thing.  Believe it or not.  Thatch.  Yo, what's up?  I just want to say that I learned today that when it comes to man boob, Hopi says, let's see what you got.  I know.  Well, someone can say it.  Hopi, people say it.  Thank you.  Let's see what you got.  Someone had to say it. 
[02:48:30]  Give me what you got.  Real quick, Dale learned today on the show that on women, it's a bunch, but on men, it's a bach.  Brilliant.  Yes.  And Ray learned, today learned that Ant can tell the difference between a 13 and 14 year old boob.  But not whether they're a boy or a girl on the phone.  That's for sure.  I sure dropped that ball.  Rem, what's going on?  What's up?  I learned Joe Friday is full of contradictions today.  And that stoners can tell the future.  Yeah, they sure can. 
[02:49:00]  What's up, buddy?  Yeah.  Apollo dog.  Apollo dog.  All right.  So I'm thinking Richard Cheese is going to play us out here, huh?  Yeah, I would love to.  You know, I'm very, very grateful to have this opportunity.  You know what?  Can I have my piano guy playing while I'm talking?  Yeah.  Oh, it's so much better that way.  Thank you.  Can I get a cocktail?  Thank you.  Frank Alano at Rascals this weekend.  That's right.  I'll be going to see Frank at the Rascals show and then going right over to the Mercury Lounge to see my show.  And I'll be splitting into two and doing my show and going to see Richard Cheese's show. 
[02:49:30]  Thank you.  I love that support.  No, you're going to send Al Pacino to the Mercury Lounge.  I will be there.  And I can't wait to see you play those songs.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Lounge Against the Machine tomorrow night at the Mercury Lounge.  That's right.  We're going to be playing a big show.  And we don't just play the little snippets that you hear on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's just for radio.  You know, the broadcast.  We kind of shorten them up.  We play full-length versions of these crazy songs.  We take the hits that the kids listen to and we swankify them.  And that's what it's all about.  One guy thought you only had one song over 15 seconds long. 
[02:50:00]  No, we have a whole album.  The CD's got all the songs.  It's over 30 minutes of entertainment on that CD.  And that's a value at 15 bucks.  All right.  Good luck with that.  But thank you so much for having me on.  And we'd like to wrap it up with a very special love song.  This is by a band named Prodigy.  Bobby, go ahead and hit it in there, would you?  I love this song.  You can hear it on our Lounge Against the Machine CD at richarcheese.com.  Change my pitch up. 
[02:50:30]  Smack my bitch up.  I said, change my pitch up.  Smack my bitch up.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Change my bitch up.  Change my pitch up.  Smack my bitch up.  Ouch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  I love you, Opie.  I love you, Anthony.  You're the other way around.  Thank you.  Frank, thank you.  Thanks to the boobs.  Thanks to the men.  Thank you to all.  And thank you.  Good night.  God bless.  Tip your DJs.  And that's all we have today.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, okay?  Right.  Thank you.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, Opie.  We're on.  Yes.  Where's Opie?  Why go to Las Vegas when GoldenPalace.com can bring Vegas to you, Opie?

See, I'm getting smart now.  Yeah.  Because it's too late to abuse me.  Yeah.  I got to go see Madonna today. 
[02:53:00]  You're going to the Madonna show, aren't you?  Madonna ticket.  I'll have a review tomorrow.  Madonna.  You know, you're going to wear a boy toy shirt.  You see that in the favorite?  Oh, my God.  I'm not going to lie.  You know, material girls think you go, material girl.  I'm not going to lie.  It's easy to, you know, act like a tough guy.  I think, you know, it's going to be worth checking out.  I'm not completely excited, but I'll go with it, you know.  I was in the elevator today coming to work, and there was a guy in the elevator with me 
[02:53:30]  talking about how he's going to the Madonna show as well.  Yeah.  Talking to, like, his fellow employee.  You were on the elevator too, right, Ben?  Yeah.  The steam that was escaping from this guy.  Oh, really?  And I'm like, oh, am I in for it tonight, man.  It's going to be such a great time.  I have such good seats.  I saw her on the Blonde Ambition tour.  Yeah.  There are only two types of guys that are going to Madonna.  It's the guys that are taking their girls.  Help me out.  Thank you.  And flaming homosexuals, pretty much. 
[02:54:00]  Which, hey, you know, if you're into that, hey, more power to you.  Look at the phones explode.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I hope he's not answering.  I'm not answering.  I have to go.  Can't abuse me now.  You know what the first thing tomorrow is going to be?  You're going to pop down a phone line.  Someone's going to go, faggot.  Host the Madonna show, faggot.  Well, give us a full review tomorrow.  I think our listeners have short-term memories, and they will not even remember that I said this  at 6.55 today, Anthony.  Sure.  We do have four pairs of tickets, though, to see Collective Soul at the Trade Winds in Seabright, 
[02:54:30]  New Jersey.  Tomorrow night, tickets are available through Ticketmaster, or if you give us a call right now,  we will give you some Collective Soul tickets, okay?  Very good.  Thanks, guys.  We appreciate it. </pre>
