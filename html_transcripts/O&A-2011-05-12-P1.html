<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of *The Wire*, reminiscing about past studio visits from cast members, followed by a review of the magic documentary "Make Believe," featuring Lance Burton and several teenage magician contestants, one of whom might be a future guest.  This transitioned into a lengthy segment showcasing videos from Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino's father, filled with highly critical and often profane commentary about his son's behavior, sexual exploits, and alleged unethical actions.  The father also criticized other *Jersey Shore* cast members, notably Ronnie. A brief, unclear phone call with someone claiming to be The Situation's father further fueled the discussion.  The hosts then shifted to a discussion of the aggressive panhandling tactics of costumed characters, particularly Elmos, in Times Square, playing audio and video clips depicting their extortion attempts, verbal abuse, and even physical altercations with tourists. The hosts speculated on the organized nature of this activity and commented extensively on the condition and smell of the costumes.

Next, the show moved to a discussion of YouTuber Jenna Marbles, showcasing clips of her videos and debating her comedic merit.  Jimmy Norton, in particular, expressed a less favorable opinion, referencing her attractiveness as a potential influencing factor. A caller claimed to have attended college with Jenna Marbles, offering some background information.  The hosts attempted unsuccessfully to contact her, sparking a heated debate about whether her humor would be perceived differently if she were less attractive.  This discussion included comparisons to other female comedians like Sarah Silverman and Lisa Lampanelli.  Comedian Jim Jeffries joined the show as a guest during this segment, discussing his recent hair transplant, travels (including a lion encounter in South Africa), his podcast, and negative experiences with guests, including a porn star.

The show then took a meandering turn, discussing a man's surprise at fatherhood, transitioning into a conversation about interracial relationships and their differing perceptions across racial lines. This included references to a rapper uninvited from the White House and an article about a Black woman's discomfort with interracial couples.  The discussion delved into racial slurs, their varying offensiveness across cultures, and mentioned terms like "pakky," "nigger," and "colored." The conversation touched upon Princess Diana's death and the controversy surrounding unreleased footage.  Lance Burton and the teen magicians from "Make Believe" were in-studio guests during this segment, performing magic tricks.  The segment concluded with a brief discussion of "Hangover Part II."

Finally, the show featured an interview with Justin Bartha promoting *The Hangover Part II*, which quickly deviated into a discussion of Mel Gibson's absence from the film, Bartha's experiences in Thailand, including explicit details about visiting sex venues and engaging with prostitutes, and the portrayal of Bangkok in movies.  The conversation also covered Zach Galifianakis's early career, Bartha's role in *Gigli*, the challenges of acting, and anecdotes about actors like Marlon Brando, Richard Dreyfuss, and Mike Tyson.  The hosts and Bartha engaged in numerous offensive jokes throughout the interview,  including comments about child sexual abuse,  and discussed American and Australian accents and cultures. The show concluded with announcements of upcoming segments and guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Not really. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning. Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody.  We'll spin it, but not really.  Not really.  It's always nice when you come into our cave  and you guys were talking about The Wire.  Yeah.  And it's one of my favorite guys in the entire series.  Literally has three lines.  And it's, if anyone hasn't heard, turn off three, two, one.  Oh my God, it's been years now, right?  But it's season five at this point. 
[00:02:00]  When she's, Method Man gets killed.  Right.  And the fucking Slim Charles shoots him in the head and that old, what the fuck did you do  do that for?  That was for Prop Joe.  Sentimental motherfucker.  This sentimental motherfucker just cost us money.  You guys, like, fucking four feet tall?  Yeah.  Oh, I want to hang out with that dude.  I did not see that one coming.  No, no.  That was a, we had had so many people from The Wire on.  That we ruined it for you, right?  It wasn't ruinative for me in that, like, there's so many characters in it, and I'm terrible 
[00:02:30]  with really remembering that much detail that I really didn't know a lot of what happened.  Some of the characters, like Snoop, I knew what was going on with that.  Omar, I knew what was going on with that.  But, like, a lot of the other shit was a complete surprise to me and stuff like that.  And, yeah, Method Man getting it.  I was just like, I went, holy shit. 
[00:03:00]  That was, and the ending of, not even, like, storyline ending, but just the fact that it  all comes back around and, you know.  Younger versions.  Younger versions of all the same motherfuckers.  It is what it is.  Yeah, yeah.  Really, really cool.  It's not going to really change.  All the shit on both sides, you know, with the police department politically, the newspaper,  the fucking streets, amazing show.  Finally finished it up last night.  And now I understand, like, when you guys are saying, how did this not win awards? 
[00:03:30]  How did it not get the recognition?  When that started, was it 2002?  I don't know.  I think so.  I think that series started.  That's about right.  And The Sopranos was still on.  Oh, yeah.  I think that did it a lot of fucking damage because it was just everybody was so tied up  in The Sopranos at that time, getting a new series that you're going to pay attention  to every week.  And we really didn't have the ability in 2002, when you think about it, to just do the marathon, 
[00:04:00]  grab all the shows, and they were playing them on demand.  You had to wait for the next fucking week to watch this, and then a year for the new  series.  It was hard enough watching The Sopranos like that.  Never mind, oh, I'm going to do this to myself again with another show?  So, you know, now I think a lot of people now are getting into it because these guys  are out there doing new shows.  And finding a new audience.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Never had a big audience.  Shit.  You found it. 
[00:04:30]  You found it five years later.  Five years later.  After we talked to every single cast member.  Dude, I look at pictures now, and I'm like, I can't believe I took a picture with that  guy.  You have pictures with fucking Omar.  Yep.  Marlo is here.  Marlo.  Fucking Chris Partlow.  Bunk.  Bunk.  Bunk.  Bob's fucking...  Snoop.  All the motherfuckers.  And I'm looking through my photos just going, holy shit, that's the coolest thing.  And at the time...  You had no clue.  It was just another person in the studio.  Nice.  Yeah, very cool, though. 
[00:05:00]  Obviously, if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.  What show are you going to start watching next?  That's just it.  It wrecks everything.  It's like, when you see a series like that, it ruins everything, because you can't really  get into another series and think like, oh, that's good.  Fuck, that's great.  Just saw a picture with Dan and Omar.  Damn it, I was out that day.  Well, the video is hysterical.  I was fucking mad.  You know, when Omar fucking goes up to Jimmy, he's like, that's you?  Oh, motherfucker, and just grabs Jimmy, gives him a big hug.  One of my favorite moments in show business, if I'm in it. 
[00:05:30]  How about in your life?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  That's a good one, man.  One of my favorite moments.  He was so good in that.  Just fucking like the antithesis of Marlo, you know, who was just a hardened fucking didn't  give a shit about anything.  And then you got Omar, who, he really did give a shit, you know?  He had like that emotional side, but he was ruthless as a motherfucker.  But to the people that really kind of, you know, deserved it and shit.  So that was like the, and then you're expecting the big, the big fucking confrontation. 
[00:06:00]  And, oh, that ain't how it happens, motherfucker.  That's not how it happens on the streets sometimes.  No, that was great.  And Kennard is, to me, Kennard was a scary guy.  That little kid was.  God, that little, he was hysterically funny to watch.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  Those kids are terrifying because they have no consequences of life in prison.  Or they just, they'll just kill you.  And the kid, he was the scariest one for me.  Yeah, yeah.  Kennard, to me, was the one you would least likely be able to talk your way out of shit with. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  A child.  Little fucker.  And you also learn that Snoop was never acting.  Right.  No, I know.  That's fucked up.  Because she, she left that series and just went back into getting into trouble.  Getting into trouble.  You need subtitles with that bitch.  Holy shit.  There's some stuff that she was saying.  I'm like, what the fuck?  She was in here, man.  I know.  I wasn't here that day.  I remember that.  Scary individual.  And again, I'm like, who the fuck is this?  Now it's like, holy shit.  That Snoop.  Motherfucker.  Well, very good.  The Wire is done.  Very cool.  It's done. 
[00:07:00]  While you were watching that, I was watching Make Believe last night.  Thanks to Roland.  Yeah.  This thing will find its audience.  Yeah.  I'll say that much.  Was it a show about management supporting the show?  Yeah.  Wow.  They don't really support this thing.  Was it about E-Rock not eating?  I was thinking about that the other day.  The show has moved up another notch and no recognition whatsoever down the hall.  Just knocking back shows left and right.  Ah, what are you going to do?  We haven't even seen the guy in months, which is good, actually. 
[00:07:30]  It doesn't matter to me.  The further he's away from me, the better off I am.  I was listening to that replay coming in this morning with Jimmy just going, he's got ice  cream ball.  It was on this morning.  And I normally just listen to the news on the way in.  Yeah.  But I had to get through that segment.  The Bulls?  It was hysterically funny just bashing E-Rock.  Well, I had to deal with that last night.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck did we do that for?  I'm like, call Jimmy.  Call Ann.  Why do you have to always fucking call me with this shit? 
[00:08:00]  What did he want?  Well, he started calling and for the first time in probably ever, I was actually scared  of E-Rock.  I'm not even going to lie.  I'll tell him to his face, too.  So he was calling and I'm like, I don't want to deal with this.  So I would just like answer, hang up.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  So I did that a couple of times and then he texts me.  All he writes is, really?  And then finally we talked and I diffused the whole thing.  I'm like, look, before you say anything, it turns out that that was one of the funniest 
[00:08:30]  things we've done in months.  Yeah, relax.  In months.  So just relax.  It wasn't like we harassed you the entire time you were down there.  You know, that was his honeymoon, technically.  Oh, is that what the deal is?  Oh, was it?  So we were fucking with him on his honeymoon.  He took like a, you know, a delayed honeymoon or whatever.  Right.  Oh, boy.  I feel better about it now.  And then he wanted to bitch and complain the whole time.  I'm like, and when Jimmy was doing the Jamaican character and then with the whale noises, it  was just a bully. 
[00:09:00]  And he couldn't say anything.  Yeah.  Because then he's like, oh, right.  And then Sam said that by the end of the night, he's tweeting references to the bit.  Oh, he was.  So he went from telling everyone to go fuck themselves.  He told a lot of people around here to go fuck themselves to tweeting about it.  Right.  By the end of the night.  So.  Was he a little upset at first?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Like I said, for the first time, I was scared to actually talk to him.  That sentimental motherfucker cost us jokes.  Just the pattern for today. 
[00:09:30]  He goes, did you give away my location?  I go, no, no.  I didn't.  I just said I didn't.  I didn't.  He goes, because they've gotten a lot of phone calls.  You know, people are trying to harass us.  I'm like, man, I don't have to tell you.  I guess we made it pretty obvious, you know, where you're at.  So.  They can't get to them, though.  And then I popped in this make-believe because we got the make-believers coming in today.  Now, what is this all about? 
[00:10:00]  Well, I'm kind of mad at Roland because he pushed this one forward.  Slammed it down our throats.  And look, yesterday he pushed Paul Bettany on us.  It was great.  And he was great.  He was.  So what do I know?  Yeah.  But he goes, look, this documentary make-believe.  It's Lance Burton and a bunch of team magicians.  The best team magicians in the world.  They all get together in Vegas and they kind of document this thing and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  And I'm like, all right, yeah, we'll have Lance Burton in. 
[00:10:30]  He's like the top dog.  I think Penn I talked to said that he was the best one or one of the best ones.  Yeah, he was one of the first magicians to get one of those ridiculous contracts in Vegas.  Lance Burton is in this film.  I swear to you, if it's three minutes, I'll be surprised.  Are you shitting me?  And that's how Roland sold this fucking thing to us.  That it's a documentary, it's not just a documentary.  Yeah, a Lance Burton documentary, basically.  He's in this for three minutes.  He gives an award away to the best team magician.  That's about it. 
[00:11:00]  Jimmy saw it, too, right?  Yeah, it was interesting.  There were parts that I really liked.  I'm not going to say who won this, but it's about a magic competition that these teenagers...  You don't realize there's teenagers right now that are obsessed with magic to the point they want to be the best in the world.  I had no idea.  Some of them are fucking good at it, too.  Are they all geeky?  No, there's one really hot chick.  She's like 17.  She's ridiculously hot.  Yeah, and...  Oh, you'd love her, yeah. 
[00:11:30]  And I think she's coming in today.  What?  This chick is hot.  Oh, no.  She's here.  The Japanese guy is coming in.  Oh, wow, that guy was very good.  He's short round.  That's amazing.  Magic Bill.  Magic Bill.  Hello, Magic Bill!  The guy with the CDs.  Oh, no, Bill Koch.  Yeah.  Oh, that guy was great.  They got the real guy.  Did you notice his father was a dick?  God, I want to tell this Bill kid that his father's a dick.  They have a...  His father's a harder man.  He's one of these military dads. 
[00:12:00]  Really?  Nothing's good enough for his son.  You know, and his three-year-old son at the time upstaged him as he's being a conductor  at this big fucking town thing, I guess.  Yeah.  And the little three-year-old, like, gets up on a table, and they have it on film, and  he's conducting.  So the crowd's laughing, like, wow, this kid's stealing the show.  But the problem is, it's his father that he's stealing the show from, and the father  can't let the fucking thing go.  Oh, shit.  He goes, that's okay, but make sure it never happens again, he tells his wife. 
[00:12:30]  We're an asshole.  The kid's three.  And that just sets the pace for this kid's life, you know?  What a douche.  Yeah, who else did you like in it?  The Africans from Cape Town?  I liked all the teenagers, because it's...  Look, everyone likes magic.  I enjoy magic.  It was fun watching people who were good at it.  But the problem is, we do a radio show.  Yes.  So magic on the radio, we usually say no to. 
[00:13:00]  Yep.  So that's the first, like, strike.  And then the second strike is, Roland goes, it's Lance Burton.  You've got to have Lance Burton on.  I'm like, okay.  But he's not in the film.  Well, he's still Lance Burton.  He's still an interesting dude.  But he's not in this film.  The girl, the ones I wanted to talk to, if I had to talk to anyone with a girl.  Right.  Chris, their name is?  Find a picture.  Kristen Stewart.  Kristen Stewart.  Find a picture.  And that guy, Bill.  The Japanese guy, or the Asian guy, was really good, but I don't know how good his English  was.  So how's he going to do today?  But he was a very fucking... 
[00:13:30]  We'll have these guys do magic tricks for Jimmy.  I want to see magic.  So that's a little later today.  Magic.  And then I like when he...  The thing didn't suck, by the way.  It wasn't a bad documentary.  I'm just trying to figure out how we make it work.  He tried to get us with a hypnotist last week, too.  Right.  I was like...  No.  I fucking was like, no.  No.  And I put it in parentheses.  I said, me, as a chicken, no to fucking hypnotists on the radio. 
[00:14:00]  I have hated that since I heard a hypnotist on the radio.  Well, we did a few of those over the years.  I know.  And I've always hated it.  Oh, my God.  Is that her?  Yeah.  She's...  All right.  Punch.  Oh, my God.  No.  No.  No, no, no.  And now she's...  Really?  She's in college.  Holy shit.  Yeah, she's in college.  Oh, no.  I think she goes to UCLA.  All right.  I'm going to be a bumbling, babbling mess.  And she seems to have some issues, so...  Really?  And there's one...  It's perfect for you. 
[00:14:30]  What I like about her is...  Good.  There's one moment they show...  Yeah.  Of just...  I'm not going to say when it was or whatever, but there was a fuck-up that happened where they  show somebody fucking up doing a magic...  I've never seen a magic trick fucked up before.  I do magic eggs!  Yeah, but she had a major fuck-up at one point, and it was like, oh, God, I guess that does  happen.  Oops.  Fuck.  An oops.  I screamed.  Yeah, but it was an easy move that she fucked up.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  And these kids, the one thing you learn is they practice all day long. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  They know their shit, so they never fuck up when it's something easy.  Hours.  Hours.  All she had to do was get the balls and a hat.  Hey, huh?  Is that what they call it these days, the kids?  But they say it's the easiest thing to do in the...  The booyah.  Booyah.  Booyah.  Booyah.  Easiest thing to do, and she fucked it up, and one fell on the floor.  Oh, boy.  You guys see the card tricks they do, though. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah?  Jimmy, how do they do the...  They make the cards appear, and then they throw them down, and then they lift their hand  back up, and another set of cards are in their hands?  That's fucked up.  It's got something to do with them being able to flip behind their hand.  They hold the cards behind their hand somehow.  It's magic.  I understand that, but they do it like four or five times.  It's like, how the fuck do you learn how to do that?  They said what this, the Asian guy, whose name I don't remember, Ikiro or something.  Just think sushi.  What he was doing, yeah, sushi.  What he was doing was technically so hard, the audience doesn't even know how hard what 
[00:16:00]  he's doing is.  Hiroki Hara.  Hiroki Hara with these four-fingered...  He was doing something with both hands, with fanning out cards with four fingers and making  them appear and disappear.  Technically, the audience doesn't even know how fucking difficult that is.  They say it's extremely difficult, that most magicians don't even really deal with that  crap.  And he pulled it off perfectly, so...  What's she doing there?  Her ring thing.  She likes the rings.  Oh, she's doing the rings?  That's an old gag.  It is.  She loves the rings. 
[00:16:30]  That's like in the prestige.  They have the rings.  Ah.  That's her thing.  Clank, clank.  All right, you want to see something?  A bullet catch.  A bullet catch.  Let's see the bullet catch.  Someone could put a button or a penny in it.  My fucking movie's great.  The prestige.  Uh, so Lance Burton will be here with the teen magicians.  You can catch him at the Pantages across the street.  The movie's called Make-Believe.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  It's done by the, uh, the same guy who did King of Kong, too. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, that was a good movie.  It sure was.  I like that one.  Hey, um, you want to fool around with the situation's dad here?  He's got...  You bet I do.  You couldn't have said that better.  What's the scoop?  He's dishy.  He's trashing, uh, the sitch.  What the fuck did he do that for?  I don't do that all day.  Well, maybe he remembers the sitch being a younger kid in better times.  The sentimental motherfucker made fun of his almost gay son. 
[00:17:30]  With his glasses.  Oh, he was fucking disgusting.  Short little old motherfucker.  He was so mad.  Just squatted the 900.  Oh, come on.  And they were kind of coming up with the money and all standing there like, oh, this is  good.  This is great.  Bam.  Now we out all that money, motherfucker.  And she gave a great speech.  There is no fucking...  Oh, it was great.  There is no, uh, nostalgia to this shit.  It's just, he was just saying...  Today, there ain't no more of this.  There ain't no more of that.  It's that.  And it was like, wow, he's taking the lead. 
[00:18:00]  He's going to be the guy that, like, kind of keeps these guys in check.  Boom!  I'd love to fucking...  I got to rule.  What the fuck did you do?  Oh, he was so tiny.  Belt-high man.  Unhappy with the murder.  How fantastic.  What did the sitch, uh, what did the sitch's dad do?  Well...  Why is he mad?  Well, I guess, uh, I guess Mikey there is, you know, not with the family these days.  No, I am.  And the father's saying, look, I helped this kid through a lot of shit. 
[00:18:30]  And he even gave him a job after the first season of Jersey Shore, because those kids  weren't making much money, you know?  No.  Uh, and I guess he's a diabetic, he's in between jobs, and his medical insurance is running  out, so he has to sitch for a little help, because the sitch is worth a few bucks right  now.  Well, how much is a little help?  I don't...  Well, he wants him to pay for his, uh, medical insurance.  Well, and how motherfucking, you know, you know what, how close are they, or are they?  He says they were close.  They were close, that, you know, the sitch had some issues, and he's, was always bailing 
[00:19:00]  them out, and helping them out here and there, and now he needs a little help, and the situation  is turning his back on his father and his family.  Because sometimes these dads are fucking assholes.  Well...  Well, like Lindsay Lohan's dad, you know?  Well, the dad has proven he's an asshole, and that, and this is probably why the situation  has nothing to do with him.  Ah, okay.  Because he doesn't get his medical insurance paid by the situation, now he makes these  videos, right away.  Oh, okay.  And now it's saying on TMZ that he wants his own reality show, so it seems like the father's  a fucking dick.  What a dick.  A dick. 
[00:19:30]  I know people say this about our show and stuff, but could this possibly be a work for  a sequel, kind of a spin-off thing?  Oh, um...  Hmm.  Yeah, I guess you can't believe everything, right?  Yeah, but people say that about this show, when things are real.  Hey, is that, was that...  Was that a bit?  St. Pat's firing a bit that lasted for two years?  Yeah, a bit.  Yeah, that's what we want to do.  So why don't we play some of the highlights from these videos?  Well, let's play some highlights.  That the father put out there. 
[00:20:00]  The sitch's dad explains who he is and what the purpose of these videos are.  What a fuck.  Just imagine someone in your own family doing this.  What the fuck?  There's enough assholes out there that want to knock you down and be an asshole to you.  But when it comes from your own family, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Imagine your dad making videos, Jimmy.  I can't comprehend it.  There's another story we're going to do today about a parent-child relationship and show,  but I just, I don't get these fucking parents, man.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  I hate them.  I think they get some jealousy.  I think so.  They get some jealousy and they want that fame as well.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, you're not, instead of just being proud for your kid, you're like, fuck  that.  I want a little of that.  And then there's some gives me that.  They want some money or whatever the fuck they want.  They want to get out of it.  Yeah.  These videos are great though.  Because then he goes after all the fucking cast members.  Oh, he does.  This guy's just a piece of work.  How you doing?  My name's Frank Sorrentino.  How's that?  I was born in Staten Island, New York.  Oh, God. 
[00:21:00]  At an early age, I got married.  I had three kids.  Like the music.  Life started early for me at 19.  Didn't have no childhood.  And as a young child, I had a bad childhood.  I solved problems the way we learned how to solve problems.  I solved problems with my hands and with my friends.  And that's who we are.  I had three kids.  Yeah.  I'm going to tell you a few stories.  One of my boys is Michael Sorrentino, also known as The Situation. 
[00:21:30]  He created more situations for me in my life than the name he gave himself.  He put me in more confrontations than any boy I ever had.  I'm all for family.  I'm all for this.  Bullshit.  You're all for yourself.  And if that's the way it is, that's fine.  I'll be on fucking.  Don't be going fucking telling nobody, oh, I do this, I do that.  You're full of shit.  I'm telling you you're full of shit.  I know you.  I stood up for you. 
[00:22:00]  I put my fucking balls on the line for you a hundred fucking times.  A hundred fucking times when you couldn't.  I asked you one fucking favor and you'd tell me to go fucking be like a regular fucking Joe Blow and go on welfare.  Now, my friend, I don't do that.  I love my son, Mike, but you know what, Mike, when you get to the top and you forget where you come from, somebody should remind you. 
[00:22:30]  I just want to remind you.  That's it.  I love my son, Mike.  He broke my heart.  And that's what this is all about.  Oof.  So sit back.  I'm going to tell you about the situation.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  What a fucking asshole.  A scumbag.  That's real.  That's not a fucking one.  Yeah, I think that's real.  Absolutely.  You can tell it's a real asshole.  What a dick.  Yeah, what a scumbag.  Ugh.  Even if the kid is a dick, there's still no reason to go on and just get attention for yourself. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  Why don't you try to work out your problems, right?  Let me tell you something also.  As an Italian watching that is like a black guy watching like,  Lordy, Lord, where bees do watermelon and fried chicken?  Lordy, Lord, lemme gives you some soft shoe and tap dance.  That is like, ugh.  But that doesn't bother you?  No, it doesn't bother me, but it's so over-the-top guinea, like fucking dumb guinea motherfucker. 
[00:23:30]  He's real guinea, though.  That's how that comes across.  Yeah, yeah, but it's not like, that's not, you know, that comes across like, ugh.  You just look at it as an Italian and go like, ugh.  But he's barely playing it to the cameras.  But that's him.  Yeah, that's him, mostly.  Yeah.  Maybe he's pumping it up slightly.  I was born Stan Eileen.  What?  I put my balls, my fucking balls on the line for you more times, you little motherfucker. 
[00:24:00]  Well, he tells the story of the sitch getting a blowjob at work.  This is just...  What the fuck?  Following year, I had to get Mike another job because he needed a summer job.  So this time, I put him with my friend who owned a big construction company.  Again, all he had to do was show up to Queens every day, and he would have no problem.  But Mike was working in, you know, heavy working out at that time. 
[00:24:30]  He was far...  He was gigantic, far from what he looks like today.  And he used to love to pose, flex, show his stomach, his ab muscles.  And so, I mean, he's a young guy.  He's working up there with some 30s and 40-year-old women.  He caught the attention of one of them.  And instead, you know, of working and maybe working out, doing something with her outside the office,  she decides that she wants to suck his dick. 
[00:25:00]  And basically, she gives him a blowjob in the office.  And why is that a problem?  All this guy's doing is making me like the situation more and hate him.  What's the problem with that?  Wow, that's really throwing some dirt around.  What's the problem?  Oh, no, he got blown once.  This guy's just mad.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've heard him all over the world.  She gets caught.  Michael claims sexual harassment.  Can you imagine this? 
[00:25:30]  This fucking guy, I get him a job with my friend.  He claims sexual harassment.  What happens is, the woman gets fired,  and Michael wants to pursue a suit of sexual harassment against the woman.  My friend gave me the job to give to him, because my friend was close to me.  This clown wants to go and claim sexual harassment, because some 40-year-old broad sucked his dick.  Again, they got rid of him, caused a problem between me and my friend, or as I would say, instead of a problem, 
[00:26:00]  caused a situation again, and put me in a situation with my friend.  And therefore, he got paid for the rest of the summer, but they told him they didn't want him in the building.  And that was that.  And now she's got a son in prison, and a grandmother in the funeral home.  This guy is just too much.  Just because he didn't get his medical insurance paid.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  So he's going to fucking just turn and rat.  Obviously, these two have had problems forever.  Hey, if that's the biggest problem you could come up with,  that you're describing like your kid getting a blowjob,  and at least it was a woman.  If he was like, and then my friend who gave him the job is sucking his dick.  No, how he fucked that story up, though, the sexual harassment thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's embarrassing for any guy.  Yeah.  No guys fucking sue for sexual harassment ever.  So that makes the situation look like a little worm. 
[00:27:00]  Well, who saw that coming?  Papa Stitch, Papa Stitch, I guess, talks about a sex tape the Stitch made.  Oh.  The sex tape was a big, big problem for me.  A real big problem for me.  Mikey went out with a young girl, very, very attractive, really nice girl.  We all liked her a lot.  Jealous.  But, you know, I guess her and Mike decided to make a tape together. 
[00:27:30]  And when they made that tape together, they had it, and it was great.  But when Mike broke up with her, she wanted it back.  And Mike didn't want to return it.  And they used to watch the tape all the time with his friends in the basement.  They would laugh and, ah, look at this, I'm banging her hair, look at this, look at that.  But, what?  Hey, I'm banging her hair, look at this, look at that.  I got a raise, I'm sucking her fucking tits.  Look at this shit.  Ah, Mingi. 
[00:28:00]  Mingi, look at this shit.  I'm going to look, she's coming like a fucking cannoli.  You know, I wonder if this guy wanted to bang that 40-year-old.  I wonder if this guy, he's just jealous.  He sounds a little jealous.  There's nothing more pathetic than a jealous parent.  Nothing more fucking pathetic.  Look at that, but what happened is that girl got married.  And, ah, when she got married, she married into a family, ah, who I know.  And, ah, their father found out about the tape. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, jeez.  And he wanted it back.  And that caused Mike a big, big problem because he didn't give the tape back.  Good.  And, ah, when it caused Mike a problem, it started to cause me a problem.  Hey, if your daughter's a fucking whore.  Because the people who wanted it back were now looking to do physical harm to Mike.  And I wasn't about to let that happen.  So, once again, Michael put me in a situation to where I had to bail him out. 
[00:29:00]  You know what?  A, you're a father helping his son.  Big fucking deal.  That's what you should do.  That's your job.  And B, all you have to do is make a copy of the tape.  How stupid is the situation?  Yeah.  Make a copy and hand it back.  You go, here you go, sorry.  Yeah, don't watch it.  I would love to hear his side of this, but he's not going to talk about this shit.  Minky.  Why would you want to keep the tape that badly?  So we could get in the basement with his friends and go, look at me fucking, ah, I'm sucking,  fucking, she's sucking my cock. 
[00:29:30]  Look at this.  Look at that.  Look at this.  Look at that over here.  Especially with the father coming at you like that.  Yeah.  You give the tape back at that point, though.  Yeah.  But this is just the one.  This is one side.  One side.  He explains the problem with the sex tape led to.  I was all for Michael giving it back.  I mean, the girl, you know, but again, he was being an asshole.  He didn't give it back and it embarrassed people.  So they upped the stakes. 
[00:30:00]  At one time, they tried to run them over.  Any stakes?  They tried to run them over with an ice truck.  What year is this?  Of course.  What year is this?  It was an ice truck.  The horse was pulling the ice.  What fucking year is this?  Who has an ice truck?  What's an ice truck in this day and age?  It's the turn of the century.  The fuck is that?  The situation has turn of the century problems.  Thank God the milkman saw it.  Right.  And put the kibosh on the whole thing.  Don Bazzini wanted the tape back. 
[00:30:30]  They shot the situation on the causeway.  He's dead.  Can we get this asshole on the show?  Looks like he would do some radio.  This guy wants some attention.  We'll give him some attention.  I bet you we could.  Yeah, let's try to get him on the fucking phone today.  Oh, Jesus.  An ice truck.  They tried to run him over with an ice truck.  I lit up the radiator with my tummy gun.  He embarrassed me.  I had all these girls.  We were going to play cards on the table, on the house. 
[00:31:00]  And he said that he was tired and get rid of the girls.  I even went ba-da-ba-da-da-da-da-da and danced into the room.  This guy sucks.  An ice truck.  Fucking.  Oh, fuck.  I've never seen an ice truck in movies.  I've seen him.  And I followed him along the roof during the San Gennaro Fest.  Yes.  That's where I got rid of the gun.  We got a theory on the sex tape.  Chris in the Poconos from that heart-shaped tub.  What's up, Chris?  Yeah, they probably didn't want to give the girl the sex tape because she was just going 
[00:31:30]  to give it to TMZ, make a couple bucks.  Yeah, that's why I would love to hear the situation's take on this whole thing.  But then you make a deal like, okay, we're all getting together and watch.  We're going to destroy the fucking tape together.  If he was paranoid about that.  But is that after he got famous that they wanted that tape?  I'm assuming that's before.  Oh, it might be.  Right.  I think that's before, bro.  Yeah, but before shit, you know.  Like he wasn't famous then when they wanted the tape.  Like he wasn't famous.  The girl got married, so the father wanted the tape.  Yeah.  But people would still want to see that after he got famous. 
[00:32:00]  But she wouldn't know.  She had no clue that he.  But maybe he was getting famous as all this shit was going down.  I don't know.  It sounds like the way this father's talking about it.  I don't know.  That this goes way back.  But it sounds like this is like old stuff.  Right.  This is pre-famous situation.  All right.  Let's get back into the ice truck.  When they tried that, he called me up on the phone.  I was with his mom in the car one day.  We were going somewhere, and the call came to his mother.  Murray Hill 5-6503.  He called his mother. 
[00:32:30]  What happened?  She handed me the phone.  And at that particular time, I made a call to some people who I knew, and I told him that  if this continued to happen, that I was going to solve the problem myself, and I was going  to exact out whatever revenge I had to do if my boy was harmed.  This guy sounds like lead.  What do you think?  Low-level mafia guy here? 
[00:33:00]  No, this sounds like a wannabe.  This sounds like a wannabe mafia guy.  He's hinting, though.  Like, he's trying to be a tough guy.  How many mafia guys you hear actually go on fucking TMZ?  None.  And tell personal family business with their son.  They would never do that.  And he was having sex.  With that girl during the wedding.  Against Tom Hagen.  Knocked him in the door.  He embarrassed me.  I saw Tom turn around and smile. 
[00:33:30]  He made the smirky smile and came down the stairs.  I knew he was fucking that fat brought against the door.  He couldn't sing.  I slapped him in the face.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I don't think he's...  He might know some people, but I've never heard a mob guy.  For real?  Do this type of shit.  Right.  Thank goodness for both sides that it didn't happen. 
[00:34:00]  We had a meeting.  We handed over the tape.  The guy was happy.  I told him there'd be no more attempts to do any harm to Mike.  Because then it would be a problem with me.  Oh, the godfather speech.  And if he wanted a problem with me, it was okay.  I really didn't care one way or the other.  Yes, you did.  If he should be struck by lightning.  And we gave the tape back.  And basically, the problem went away.  Why didn't they just make copies?  Oh, he's trying to sound like the fucking... 
[00:34:30]  Like a mob guy.  You didn't solve a union issue.  Yeah.  Your kid fucked some chick on a tape and handed it over.  We had a meeting.  And the cops showed up.  We had to jump out the windows and run.  Oh, god.  Stop it.  All he's doing is making the situation look cooler.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He got blown and he fucked the chick on tape.  Oh, that terrible guy.  Yeah, this is horrible stuff.  Showed it to his friends.  Some crazy dirt. 
[00:35:00]  I guess the sitch was in a car accident.  And that was a problem for the father as well.  Why?  Did he threaten the...  Did he punch the tires off the sitch's body?  And I hit the car.  The car wanted problems with me.  I knocked the car into grill.  It was a minor accident.  No one was injured.  The car in the compound.  That's all blown.  It's blown up.  It burnt out.  And Tom Hagen goes...  Minor accident.  No one was injured.  One day Mike was driving to school. 
[00:35:30]  I think he was about 16 now.  16, 17.  And he started experimenting with some controlled substances that created a lot of smoke.  So the car was filled with smoke.  And as he's driving on Tennant Road, as he tells me, he didn't see what he ran over.  How could you?  He's fucking high as a kite.  The car's filled with smoke.  He didn't see nothing.  The music's loud.  And as he tells it on MTV, he made it sound like, oh, the car just stopped. 
[00:36:00]  No.  Mike ran over a sewer grate that ripped out the whole undercarriage of the car.  Oh, Mingy.  Ripped the whole undercarriage out of the car.  And the car came to a stop.  He said he didn't know why.  Well, there was parts behind him from before he made the turn to where he stopped.  But you see, he couldn't stay there because the car was full of smoke.  Still.  He didn't want to get caught.  So what does he do?  Runs into the woods.  And guess who he calls?  Me.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  I get there.  Now, I was a person of suspect at that particular time in another state.  So I really didn't need any more aggravation.  Oh, my God.  I was a person of suspect, not a person of interest.  I was a person of suspect in another state for another thing.  That's a man act.  He knocked a mailbox over.  One time, the situation was driving through people's backyards, knocking down mailboxes. 
[00:37:00]  Got a girl on a tape in the car.  That's a man act.  Probably had a speeding ticket in Pennsylvania.  Yeah, it was nothing.  Another state.  Relax, Papa Sitch.  Really?  You're wanted?  Papa Sitch.  A wanted man in another state?  At one time, he was drying his sunglasses with the tissue paper, and the woman had to come out and go,  Yoo-hoo!  And tell him that he was dragging the toilet paper.  He actually said, nice ass.  We had to sit down and apologize for him saying nice ass. 
[00:37:30]  This guy's hideous.  Have a meeting.  So I really didn't need any more aggravation, nor any more confrontation with the police.  But I came down there anyway for Mike.  Told him I was driving the car.  Car's full of smoke.  Still, roll the windows down.  He asks me if I smoke.  I say no.  He asks me where Mike is, because they knew I had a son.  I said there was nowhere to be found.  I said I was driving the car.  I said if there's a problem, you can deal with me on it. 
[00:38:00]  They knew I wasn't the driver.  Mikey was hiding in the woods.  Again, they had nothing on me.  They were forced to let me go.  What?  We told the car away.  What?  Wait, wait, wait.  First of all, had the cops know that he had a son?  And the car, like no one's in the car.  The old man's the only one that shows up.  What the fuck?  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Not at all.  This guy's a lion sack of shit. 
[00:38:30]  I think he's folding under questioning.  It really cemented myself to do this after.  Cement, another stereotype you're best.  Michael's agent.  Oh.  Mike sent.  Mike?  My agent an email telling him about libel and this and that.  And we're going to do this and we're going to do that.  Mingy.  Guy in the middle going, what do you want from me? 
[00:39:00]  All I could say is, listen, Mike.  You got a fucking problem.  You want to fucking say something.  You could call me up and you could tell me.  You don't have to run around a fucking bush, hide behind a fucking wall, email me like some fucking telephone tough guy.  You got something to say, fucking say it.  Or else, shut the fuck up.  Okay?  Sounds loving.  And we'll go from there.  Because the last time I saw you in June, you wanted to suck my dick. 
[00:39:30]  Okay?  What?  So, don't come off like some type of tough guy, Mike.  Because in the world I come from, if you want to dance with somebody, you make sure you know who you're going to ask to dance.  If you want to dance with me, Mike, you should be ready to get out there and go for it.  That's it, my friend.  Wow.  He's just telling his son, I'll beat you up.  This guy is fucking awful.  If you want to dance with somebody, you better know how to dance.  How embarrassing.  The dance.  God, I like the situation all of a sudden. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  He's doing a dance.  One time, he was standing there learning how to make sauce when he should have been conducting business.  Put in your sausage, your meat. 
[00:40:30]  He told the girl he loved her.  He couldn't wait to see her.  Hey, you want to know how to dance?  Oh, this guy is such a wannabe fucking guinea mobster.  You want to...  Stop it.  You want a bonus clip?  Oh, of course I do.  There's another clip I need.  I don't have in front of me.  He goes after Dina, the new cast member, and Snooki.  And Snooki, yeah.  He has some great shit to say about those two.  If we can find that clip, it would be wonderful.  But we have a bonus clip here. 
[00:41:00]  The Sitges' dad talks about Ronnie from the Jersey Shore.  Oh.  Ronnie.  Fucking crybaby.  How do you get on TV and cry like a fucking bitch over a girl?  You're crying on fucking television?  You want everybody to know that you're a fucking fag?  That you want everybody to know, oh, I'm fucking savvy, I'm savvy.  Get the fuck out of here.  Be a fucking man.  She wants to go, let her fucking go.  Get somebody else.  Don't cry like a fucking fag. 
[00:41:30]  You know what the sitch must have heard growing up?  Oh, yeah.  Everything I heard growing up.  Oh, yeah.  All the big words.  This guy's trying so hard to fucking shoehorn himself in.  Yeah.  To be famous.  Tough guy, father.  Hey, you think the sitch is something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You look out for me.  Does anybody respect this guy?  It's horrendous.  No.  It all makes sense now.  It all makes sense now. 
[00:42:00]  I think the sitch isn't allowed to be who he really wants to be because he grew up with  this guy.  I think the sitch is very confused.  One time, the situation wanted to go out shopping with me and the rest of the family.  Yeah.  He brought what he called a puppet.  Yeah.  He brought what he called a puppet, but it was not a puppet.  It was a doll.  And I said, what are you?  What's the matter with you?  What are you, a fag with your doll?  And his mother opens her fucking mouth and goes, it's a puppet. 
[00:42:30]  And then the spaghetti, fucking, I threw it against the wall and the kid starts fucking  crying like some kind of fucking faggot.  Oh, brother.  Hopefully, Sam's getting the Snooki clip.  Yeah.  He calls her a pig.  Let me tell you about the time his good friend wanted to suck his fucking cock in a tree house. 
[00:43:00]  Huh?  His half a fag is up in a fucking tree house and it's not a fag it wants to suck his fucking  dick.  I say, no way.  The sitch.  The sitch's dad makes my dad look like Ward Cleaver.  He's got to deal with that shit.  Oh, of course he's not going to pay him for fucking medical treatment.  He wants his taste.  Yeah.  This guy wants his taste.  That's all it is.  Allow us to wet our beaks. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  He just wants a taste of that sitch money.  You carry your 40-year-old women in your pocket like so many nickels and dimes.  He's probably jealous because he probably told the situation, look, I wouldn't mind being  part of the Jersey Shore.  You know, bring me in for a little something.  Nah, well, you know, I'm not really in charge of that.  He probably has to kind of blow him off a little bit.  That's all I did for you.  I talk to MTV.  They're thinking about it, but, you know, I don't know.  We'll have to see and see what happens.  Yeah.  And then the father finally had it. 
[00:44:00]  He wants his taste.  He wants his taste of the money and the taste of the fame.  What an asshole.  This is probably a speeding ticket.  I was suspect.  Another state suspect.  For what?  Person of...  You're laying everything out on the fucking line.  Not just taken.  That could be the worst, worst listener call ever.  I didn't hear a word he said.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Hey.  He's gone on his own.  You've got to learn how to do radio if you're going to do radio. 
[00:44:30]  Hey.  That's what he did.  Yeah.  Sorry.  We've got the real father on the phone.  Oh.  It's his father.  You've got to set the situation straight here, fellas.  You see, I was the brains behind the show, The Jersey Shore.  You see, I used to yell at the kid.  I said, you're smoking weed all day.  You're hanging out at the beach with the friends.  What do you think?  You're going to have the cameras come follow you around or something?  You're going to have a show?  Next thing I know, he's got a show. 
[00:45:00]  They owe me everything.  She was giving him a B.J.  She was supposed to be doing his homework.  Wait.  Is this the father of Chip?  Yeah.  No, no.  This is the situation.  Are you sure?  Because now I'm starting to think that maybe the father of Chip has problems with Chip.  And Chipster's fame.  The Chip-tuation.  The Chip-tuation.  Yeah.  The father was calling him up.  Because one time he was doing construction and he built something.  It was toppled over and stuff. 
[00:45:30]  You know, something like that.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you don't talk to your son anymore?  No.  His mother's a saint on earth.  But no, I don't talk to him no more because I asked him if he could help me because my felt  hat needed to be fixed.  I couldn't.  I couldn't.  I said it felt bad.  It felt bad.  It felt bad. 
[00:46:00]  It felt like that.  I can't hear nothing.  Am I still on?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, you are.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  My phone's broken.  I think that went good, though.  I think that went good, though.  Okay.  That's good enough for me.  I'm the best.  Okay.  Every Wednesday night.  Then I have small mountain cat.  The mountain cat.  That I terrorize people.  You terrorize people with a mountain cat.  Okay. 
[00:46:30]  Well, I don't know if you.  You better not bring the mountain cat in for the first time.  Okay.  Okay.  Come by quarter to nine.  Sign up and see how you do.  Okay.  And then maybe just for extra bonus, I choked some of you faculty staff.  Yeah.  You choked the staff.  Yeah.  Okay.  Whatever.  Okay.  Then I come out with whip.  Yeah.  You come out with the whip.  Okay.  We'll stop by.  We'll see how the act goes.  Okay, my friend.  Thank you, my friend. 
[00:47:00]  The O.B.  and Anthony Show.  The O.B.  and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  For the virus.  Sirius XM.  You guys want a bonus clip from the situation's dad?  More bonus clips.  More bonus clips.  From this guy.  Well, because he goes after the...  This fucking guy.  Yeah.  He goes after the other cast members of Jersey Shore.  What's the Batman story, by the way?  I didn't get to read it.  Wow.  Batman got the shit beat out of him or something?  Oh, in Hollywood?  Yeah.  What happened? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  It's one of those, you know, Hollywood Boulevard fucking Batman guys.  Oh, he's not one of these real superheroes?  Take pictures.  No, he's not real.  No, because there's a whole culture of guys that are starting to feel like...  There were two stories.  One was like a kind of a fat Batman guy.  Right.  And then the other one was this guy that's on video.  And some guy just comes up and beats the piss out of him.  Body slams him on the sidewalk and starts punching his face.  It's pretty embarrassing for Batman.  Yeah, he's got no bats or something. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, he's got bats in his belfry.  That's stupid.  Was it on Hollywood Boulevard?  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  Oh, so it's just one of those characters.  One of those dumb characters that are out there.  That's starting to happen with Times Square.  In their stinky suits.  Oh, when I see the fucking Elmo thing, I want to kick him.  I want to kick that fucking dumb, stinky, stained Elmo.  And dumb tourists.  Oh, look, let's get a picture.  If you knew what was in those suits, people, if you knew what the fuck was in those suits, 
[00:48:30]  one of the Elmos was a major problem.  Yeah.  And then the paper did a whole story when it came back on the street because he had to  go away for a while.  Oh, did he?  Because he's like shaking down tourists.  Like, if you go up to a certain Elmo, because I noticed there's a bunch of them.  Yeah.  And I think that's part of the scam now, which is the evil one.  And if you go up to Elmo and go, oh, okay, you know, and take the picture without giving  up a little kish.  Elmo gets all mad.  Oh, yeah, he does.  He's gotten in some faces. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Why aren't you paying me, you cocksucking fucking dick?  No, it's more like, hey, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Oh, take a picture with Elmo.  Take a picture with Elmo.  Where's my money?  Hey, look, motherfucker.  Right.  Where's my money, bitch?  You don't want to get beat up by Elmo in front of your family.  You want your kid back, don't you, motherfucker?  No, don't fuck with Elmo in Times Square if it's the same guy.  Yeah.  They really don't want him around, but they don't know how to get rid of him yet.  How about you fucking... 
[00:49:30]  Immigration.  Immigration.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  These...  And I saw a Mickey Mouse out there, and I'm just thinking, I don't think that's sanctioned  by Disney.  Nope.  It looked like it was all dirty.  Like, all those things are just dirty.  Looks like they were standing too close to the curb by a puddle when a bus came by.  Every one of those suits.  Some exhaust.  Matted.  They got exhaust all over their suits.  Yeah.  I saw four Elmos on the same corner, just hanging out.  I've seen Elmo fight.  Just hanging out. 
[00:50:00]  I've seen four homos in the same office back here.  Meaning you guys.  Of course.  I think the fact that there's more than one Elmo, it's a little gang activity.  Is there a gang now?  The Elmos?  Yeah.  And I think...  They all wear their backpacks.  They're not even trying.  No, they don't even try.  No, they don't even hide their backpacks for the day.  No, they have Christmas stockings as what they ask for money.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're just out there like beggars.  I've seen Elmo, Cookie Monster, Mickey and Minnie, Buzz Lightyear. 
[00:50:30]  And they're all just fake enough that Disney probably couldn't do anything.  Like the eyes are a little too big on Mickey Mouse.  Yeah.  My ex wanted a picture with the Elmo.  We took one.  Did you?  Did you pay?  I don't remember.  I would have though.  I would have, you know.  Oh, I can't see.  Can you find that if it's still on the internet?  It's the new scam.  There are so many scams going on in Times Square.  And we've talked about that CD one.  When I see a Rube from fucking like the South walking around with a rap DVD or CD in his hand 
[00:51:00]  that he had to pay some fucking crook for.  The cops knocked that shit down though.  Because that situation...  I see it all the time.  Not as much.  Man, I see him.  I see him every day.  Dude, I see him all the time.  There you go.  Elmo terrorizes Times Square once again.  See, so this guy came back.  And they're not happy about this.  But the problem is there's more than one.  So you don't know which one is the asshole.  Evil Elmo.  Right.  Returned to his post in Times Square demanding payment for the photos and generally disturbing 
[00:51:30]  all who grace his path.  But according to Elmo himself, he's just trying to, what, earn an honest wage.  Earn an honest wage.  He told the Daily News.  I'm not being rude.  Taking an Elmo picture without paying is rude.  Hug tourists.  Then why are you fucking dealing with the tourists?  But what they do is they say, oh, you want to take a picture? 
[00:52:00]  Then you take the picture.  And then they demand the money.  See, they demand payment after everything.  Of course.  That's the way it works.  It's more like extortion because it's even more than that.  Because they'll just be standing around.  But then the minute they see a family with some kids, then they get all wavy and they try  to get the kids' attention.  Because then the kid goes nuts.  They want the picture.  And then the extortion comes in.  Well, if you want the picture, your kid's going to scream and cry unless you give me  five dollars.  Right.  And that's basically what it is.  And they don't do anything but stand there until they see a mark.  And then they start going into their dumb act.  Passers-by who attempted to take a photograph with Elmo were usually met with angry shouts 
[00:52:30]  of five dollars, five dollars, no five dollars, no picture of Elmo.  And the few times the character attempted to knock cameras out of people's hands.  Oh, wow.  A tourist said, I'm just disgusted.  This thing is, I don't mind giving a dollar.  Oh, the thing is, I don't mind giving a dollar, but that funny red thing was too aggressive.  Oh, sorry.  It's very far away.  It's like a reading test doing this. 
[00:53:00]  I think it swore at me.  I wasn't going to let my daughter anywhere near that.  Oh, I also think it kind of smelled.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's happened to society?  Now Elmo is trying to shake down kids for a dollar.  Only in New York.  I think that, I think Sam with a video camera or somebody, whoever wants to do it, could  perhaps try to get pictures with Elmo and see what happens. 
[00:53:30]  That would be a good one.  We've kind of tried, but the problem is, like I said earlier, there's more than one of these  guys now.  So you don't know which one is the asshole.  Find the real guy.  Find out.  Yeah.  Wire him up with a wireless.  For some reason there's a bunch of them.  There's two I've seen just on the corner over here.  Yeah.  I've seen a red Elmo, a blue Elmo.  I don't think it's Cookie Monster.  It's a blue Elmo.  Yes.  Uh, and a Mickey Mouse and a Minnie Mouse.  He needed the money.  I've seen, I've seen more than one red Elmo at the same time.  I'm telling you that I think this is some kind of, this is kind of really gang scam thing. 
[00:54:00]  I'm telling you there's something going on with the Elmo's.  You gotta look into it.  I saw one guy take his picture.  It was fucking awkward because he didn't want to, the guy didn't want to pay.  Yeah.  And he fucking, he's like walks away and Elmo's like, what the fuck did you do that for?  If you're saying, this fucking puppet costs us money.  If you're talking that, wait, there's red and blue Elmo's?  Yeah.  So in essence, you're talking, there's blood and crip Elmo's.  That's what I'm getting at.  Walking around the street.  Without saying it. 
[00:54:30]  Yes.  The red Elmo's and the blue Elmo's.  Oh my God.  You see this in Times Square.  Yeah.  Look at that.  I'm telling you there's something going on.  Yeah.  Cause that's not Cookie Monster.  There you go.  There's a picture of a blue Elmo and a red Elmo.  You figure it out.  The feet, the bottom of the feet.  Look how dirty they are.  Oh God.  They're disgusting.  Sounds like garbage juice.  What do you think?  They fucking take that beggar money and, and dry clean those things every day?  Hell no.  Please.  They reek.  Elmo dumps.  They stink.  Farts.  You know, I'd love to fucking pull one of those heads off and just see what's under there. 
[00:55:00]  It wouldn't be attractive.  No.  Or a surprise.  I'm guaranteed.  You're like, I think they're like, uh, I want to say Mexican or Spanish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's one with his head off.  Of course, a cop's got him and gets the car.  That's, that's wonderful.  That's what you're dealing with.  What is that?  When you go to Times Square.  There you go.  With your family.  That's Elmo.  That's the one shaking down people.  Why does a thin layer of furry fabric let you, let your child near this thing when, 
[00:55:30]  if that costume was off, you wouldn't fucking, you'd grab your kid and cross the street.  And cross the street.  And cross the fucking street.  They're criminals.  I don't know, Uncle Paul.  Sometimes a costume helps.  Does a costume help you?  You've got to make sure the front's really thin.  You use like a thin spandex material.  And then do you, where do you hold the child in front of you?  Sure you do, for the picture.  Like a, like a front pack.  Hey, take the picture.  Free of charge. 
[00:56:00]  People saying Grover's the blue Elmo.  Grover?  So we got that wrong.  Is that a Grover?  All right.  I don't know.  What the fuck do we know, man?  You know the Cookie Monster song?  It's not Grover.  It's not Grover?  No, we all know Grover has a big nose.  Oh, right.  Are you saying he's a, uh...  Oh, that's a blue Elmo.  Get the fucking Elmo.  Get the fucking Elmo.  Get the fucking Elmo out of here.  It's a blue Elmo that they're trying to pass off as a Cookie Monster.  We just zoomed in on the picture.  That's a blue Elmo.  Maybe it is Cookie Monster.  I don't fucking know.  Cookie Monster has googly eyes.  Googly eyes, and they're not on top of his head like that, I don't think. 
[00:56:30]  It's a criminal in a shitty outfit.  Who cares what it is?  It really is.  It's not either one of those guys.  It's just a furry, smelly outfit.  Ugh.  Can you find more Elmo clips?  I hate outfits.  Where he's getting arrested?  See, Cookie Monster...  Nah.  It might be.  It might be Cookie Monster.  Cookie Monster has eyebrows, and that fucking thing doesn't have eyebrows.  And Cookie Monster's got a neck like Godzilla.  That's Cookie Monster.  Yeah, it might be.  Maybe it's just a shitty fucking version of Cookie Monster.  It would be a completely shitty version.  All right.  It's ghetto fucking Cookie Monster. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  And Elmo...  Yeah, you know what?  I think it's ghetto Cookie Monster.  It's just a ghetto version.  Elmo's got a big nose, too, that isn't on the costume, is it?  Of course.  No, Elmo...  Actually, you know what?  Elmo has the nose.  Look, and Cookie Monster doesn't.  So that's what's leading me to believe that this is Cookie Monster.  That's Cookie Monster.  But look at that.  Elmo has a nose.  Oh, Elmo does have a nose.  I can't see it.  All right.  So it is Cookie Monster, but it's a shitty fucking version.  That's a shitty-ass Cookie Monster.  An A.D. Cookie Monster.  How's that...  A.D. Monster.  How's that costume shop... 
[00:57:30]  Costume.  ...in business if they're making shitty Cookie Monster outfits?  And you know what?  But the great thing that the fucking questionable mayor did when he shut down the street there  and made a pedestrian walkway thing is just open it up to these shills and fucking carniacs  and bullshit.  Because everyone walks.  Because they can just stand around now.  There's more video.  That is hysterical.  More video of Elmo getting arrested.  Is there sound on this one? 
[00:58:00]  I told you.  I feel so bad for Elmo.  He's getting a ticket.  Stupid Taurus.  He deserves to be hit over the head.  Elmo's going to jail.  Ah, there's cops like shaking down Elmo.  Because Elmo's an asshole.  Oh.  Elmo looks like Chris Rock from the side.  He's getting a ticket.  Bye, Elmo.  I'm sorry.  Oh, you might as cunt.  Yeah, fuck you, man. 
[00:58:30]  White motherfuckers.  Elmo.  Oh, stop it.  Elmo getting arrested.  That's great.  Ah, yeah.  You were saying something.  Ah, whatever.  I don't know.  All right, so we got the sitch's dad with a couple more bonus clips.  He's going after the situation.  And then he goes after everybody on Jersey Shore.  Dina, new cast member you probably didn't watch this year.  No.  She's just like a drunken fucking pig they brought on. 
[00:59:00]  Really?  Yeah.  And this is what the situation dad has to say about her.  All right.  Dina, first class Italian pig.  Any girl who shows their book yak the first time they're on fucking television is a pig.  She whipped up her skirt, showed my son her book yak.  I mean, are you fucking kidding me or what?  Book yak.  And I got to tell you, if you take a look at those girls on that show, I mean, who's attractive?  I mean, Sammy's a pretty girl.  And J-Wow, obviously her figure speaks for herself. 
[00:59:30]  But the other two, they're like trolls.  They live under the bridge.  The both of them.  The both of them.  Her book yak.  This guy's horrible.  What is that?  Italian.  I have that with some gabagool, some book yak.  Oh, my mother.  The way she used to make a book yak.  A book yak.  It would smell.  The entire house would smell like clams.  A book yak.  It was mussels, clams, and then some abakala.  My father would put on an oven mitt and slap my mother's book yak back and forth until it 
[01:00:00]  made the big, big, big, big, big noise.  Buk yak.  Stupid.  I never heard that before.  No, I've never heard that.  Buk yak.  Buk yak.  Stop it.  Is that a real word, you think?  I guess.  For the poohawk?  I'm sure it is.  It has to be.  Snooki.  This is what he has to say about Snooki.  The final clip, finally, from the situation's dead.  Snooki, for God's sake.  My God.  I got to tell you, if I was that girl's father, I'd run for cover. 
[01:00:30]  Run for cover.  Run for cover.  I read an article in a paper about her that Rutgers University gave her, like, $34,000  to talk.  If I was a woman, a young woman, I would want my tuition back.  Because possibly what could she tell anybody other than how much dick she sucks or that  she named Vinny's cock.  She gave it a name.  Oh.  Or what else could she do?  Act intoxicated?  Four foot eleven piece of shit roaming about.  That's what she is. 
[01:01:00]  Aw.  First of all, they're not even all Italian.  Okay?  The girl, Snooki, portrays herself as Italian.  She says her name is Nicole Polizzi.  But she was born in Chile.  So it's like, basically, you're a German shepherd living with a bunch of beagles, and you say,  I'm a beagle.  You're not.  You're a German shepherd.  She's Spanish.  So that's what she is.  She's Chilean.  She was adopted by Italian people.  Okay?  Give some fuck.  And they're probably fucking crawling under the rug the way she acts. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  I got to be honest with you.  If that was my daughter, there'd be a severe fucking problem.  Oh, God.  She might never talk to me again, but I don't give a fuck.  I'm not going to have you running around, pulling up your fucking dress, showing everybody  you pick up, wanting to blow guys into bed constantly.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Now we know why the situation doesn't deal with his father.  What an uninteresting man.  He's uninteresting.  He's a horribly boring man.  How are you saying that much and losing me? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, he's trying to get something going.  It's just not happening.  He's trying to be interesting.  Trying a little too hard, you think?  Yeah.  Hey, the guy that tells it all, he's jealous.  Sorry that nobody wants to pay 34 Gs to hear you talk, pal.  Sorry.  That's the way it works out.  Yeah, if they want to pay it, fuck it.  Too bad.  It's the way it is.  Dane Cook does arenas and I don't.  You know what?  That's the way it is.  That's not Dane's fault.  You know what I mean?  You got to shut your fucking mouth.  Yeah.  Hey, they gave it 34 grand.  And in that moment lies everything he's doing right now. 
[01:02:30]  He's fucking jealous.  How pathetic.  A jealous parent.  Jealous of your own kid.  Oh, how fucking embarrassing.  That's just creepy.  That's right.  The situation probably gets more to speak than you get in a year, sir.  Sorry.  Oh, yeah.  It is what it is.  What can I tell you?  Deal with it.  Fuck, that annoys me.  Hey, the dough showed a book yak.  A book yak.  Meanwhile, he's not working. 
[01:03:00]  Is he between jobs?  He can't afford health insurance?  Who the fuck are you to criticize how anybody else makes money?  At least she's making money.  At least she's getting money to talk.  And he talks a good game like he knows people.  Yeah, yeah.  So why can't he get one of those fake jobs like he was hinting at that his son got?  A fake job where all he had to do was show up.  Yeah.  He knows people.  He just doesn't fucking mention them.  Then get one of those people to give you a fake job so he gets your fucking health insurance.  Yeah.  Sorry nobody wants to blow you on the construction site.  Sorry.  Because you're hinting that you're one of those type of guys. 
[01:03:30]  I would love to talk to him.  Are we getting closer to getting his number, Danny?  We tried a few things, right?  We tried a bunch of different numbers, but nothing was yielding results that we were looking for.  You didn't get any book yak?  Hey, book yak!  We'll try.  We'll keep trying.  Book yak!  Danny had a bunch of videos of Velmo getting arrested and harassing people.  Oh, yeah.  There's a lot of those.  The audio isn't good enough to play, but Elmo's been a problem in Times Square for a while. 
[01:04:00]  Elmo's an absolute problem.  And I think that's why he's up by us now, because all those videos were more in the heart of Times Square.  So I think that's why now we see the Elmo and the Cookie Monster on the outskirts.  They're pushing them to the outskirts.  The outskirts of Times Square is still a little shady, man.  Yeah.  It gets a bit shady.  I'm just looking at this.  What happened?  See, last night when I wasn't watching The Wire, I was looking at...  There's this chick on YouTube. 
[01:04:30]  Her name is Jenna Marbles.  You ever see her?  Hot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Goofy.  Like, there's something about her, because she makes these videos.  Do you like hot and goofy?  I like hot and goofy.  You do like hot and goofy.  I like Goofy Girls.  She's pretty fucking hot and goofy.  Right.  But she makes these videos every week, and I've been watching them.  What kind of videos?  Just goofy videos.  She does one where she... 
[01:05:00]  But she's really, like, sexy looking.  Like, look at this picture here.  That's her.  It's Nicki Minaj.  Oh, well, she's doing it.  You know, I think I'm a difficult person to date, because there's so many of me.  Because there's plain Nicki Minaj.  That is a good one, though.  And then there's...  Huh?  That isn't a good one.  No.  There's one, like, how to trick people into thinking you're attractive.  Oh, that's her?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You're seeing that one, right?  Yeah, because that's, like, her most popular one.  She has a lot of views. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  But she's goofy, and she's got a really dirty mouth.  Talks about, you know, her pussy and sucking dick.  Oh, I know this one.  And welcome.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the one that made her famous.  Yeah.  17 million views, just about.  Yeah.  If you're born really ugly like me, have no fear.  There's steps you can take to be good-looking, kind of.  I've already taken some steps before we even start.  But she's hot as fuck.  But you can tell she's...  Look at this picture of her.  And I sand my skin because if I didn't, I would look like an album. 
[01:06:00]  But you can tell she's good-looking.  Oh, I know.  She made herself ugly, and then goes back to being really good-looking.  Anyway, you can ruin all of your ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And when it washes off, you can look like you have a bit of life.  If you're blind as a fucking bath, like me, make sure you get contact lenses.  Glasses are for douchebags.  I also have a retainer.  Now that you've got all that down, it's time to start getting ready.  Step one, take a shower, because you're probably dirty.  Hold on.  Probably took a while, because you're one ugly mother. 
[01:06:30]  Now it's time to do your makeup.  But literally, take a bunch of makeup on your face and you don't.  Now it's time to do your eye makeup.  I like to use colors like black, because it says, I'm a whore.  The goal is to make yourself look nothing like yourself.  Perfect.  If you're thinking about going with a more natural look, let's be serious.  You're way too ugly to pull that off.  Now it's time to put on some fake whore lashes and draw on some cartoon eyebrows.  Super duper.  Don't forget your hoochie lipstick.  I like this one, because it makes me look like a streetwalker. 
[01:07:00]  Now it's time to abuse your hair.  That was not good for it.  Now remember, since you were born public, you're probably pretty weird.  That means, God forbid you ever go in public, you're probably going to embarrass yourself.  Don't do any of this.  And she does like, that's her goofy.  Especially not this.  And only a little bit of this. 
[01:07:30]  That's legs.  Yeah.  Next step is, go out and get yourself a job that's super degraded.  I picked dancing in my underwear.  Before I go to work, I like to pump myself up by crying over my master's degree.  There's one where she's in a bikini, because she couldn't go to Cancun.  So, uh, she, she got a bunch of bikinis anyway, so she just wears them around her house, and  her dog is like licking her ass.  She's laying there in a bikini, little bikini bottom, and the dog, her, one of her two dogs 
[01:08:00]  is licking her ass, and she's going, stop licking my ass.  It's fucking great.  She's, uh, yeah, she's pretty hot.  Yeah, I've heard of her, actually.  I don't think I would enjoy her videos, though.  What?  I don't know if I would enjoy them.  Well, she's goofy.  I don't enjoy, like, I'm not looking at them going like, oh.  You didn't like that, Jimmy?  Oh, that's good.  Wait, Jimmy didn't like that.  No, I understand why I entered.  Oh, yeah, I like goofy.  And she's fucking, you know.  What, what problem did you have, Jimmy?  She's hot. 
[01:08:30]  Um, just.  Don't like her?  No, I don't hate her.  Yeah.  But she's just.  Well, you know what, Jimmy?  You only saw one.  You want to see another one?  You want to see another one?  Maybe, maybe we could turn you?  If, if I have a choice, I'm going to throw a giant null out there, but.  If the boys want to see it, I'll sit through it.  See the bikini one you'd like.  I don't know where that one is.  Uh, some Cancun thing.  You didn't think she was funny, did you?  Like, didn't go to Cancun.  Was she trying too hard?  No, no, no, no.  I, I.  It got 17 million views, man. 
[01:09:00]  It's, it's sort of the Rodney King beating.  That wouldn't, you know.  Although that is funny.  Yeah.  Um.  It's just not my style.  I don't like that.  Yeah, they're, they're like, there's only like three that I really think are kind of funny.  Wait, no, no, it's trying to downplay you.  No, no, no.  You were all in 10 minutes ago.  No, I said, because she's.  No, no, no, you, you're acting like she's Cal Burnett in 1970.  And now it's also like, well, actually, I just like her couple.  I wouldn't come all over Cal Burnett's face in 1970.  This chick, wow.  Well, should I, should I just.  You're backing down a little bit, Eric.  No, no.  A little bit.  I'm being honest, because, because even the first one, the, the Nicki Minaj one, I'm like, 
[01:09:30]  that ain't even a good one.  Like, right off the bat, I said it wasn't a good one.  How many of these videos did you check out yesterday?  Probably seven.  Ten.  Probably ten of them.  You guys want to watch magic?  I mean, we have magicians coming as topical.  Magic's kind of funny.  I thought that was.  Okay, sure.  You thought magic was funny?  I trust Anthony's judgment.  She does things on her face.  Magic.  It's very hot.  I can do it. 
[01:10:00]  I don't use a wand.  Because I only do tricks with my mind.  Meet my assistant.  Dog assistant.  All real magicians have dog assistants.  Watch me do magic.  Maybe I'm just captivated by her, um.  You just think she's stunning good looks.  She's kind of cute, I mean.  Fucking magic.  I can do levitation.  And she's not afraid.  Just kidding, I can't.  I can disappear. 
[01:10:30]  I'm back.  I can read your mind.  Boobies.  All right, I call bullshit.  If this was a fat pig, you wouldn't give a fuck about this.  You're right.  That's true.  No, no, you are absolutely right.  That's no fucking surprise.  I would hate her.  I do explosions.  You just think she's hot.  Yeah.  This is fun.  I like cats on fire.  But it's all about the hotness.  You're useless.  The thing is, she's hot.  And she's being goofy. 
[01:11:00]  Do you mind?  I'm trying to enjoy Richard Pryor filmed live in concert.  Jimmy?  No, I didn't like that one.  I made a mistake.  It was a...  Look at her.  She's hot.  We went to...  We got a guy on the phone that went to college with Jenna Marbles.  Oh, yeah?  Want to get to know her?  Is it her father?  Hey, she's showing a book.  Rob, what do you got, buddy?  Yeah, I went to school in Boston right there.  She was absolutely disgusting, I want to say, five years ago. 
[01:11:30]  She was on the softball team.  She had cornrows all four years of high school.  Or college, rather.  Well, she figured it out, I guess.  Yeah, all I want to do is slide my cock into her right now, to be honest with you.  She's okay looking.  She's cute.  But, I mean, she's kind of goofy.  I can see her being like...  She's an amusing girl.  She's not, like, awful.  No, no, but...  If I was a teenage girl, I would love her.  Like, if I was, like, 21 or 19, and I was a teenage chick, I'd probably think she was  the bee's knees, but...  Oh, I'd probably have the mind of a teenage girl. 
[01:12:00]  You do.  Oh, boy.  Anthony's not only going through, like, a midlife crisis.  He's going through a gender midlife...  Gender?  No, I...  See, because I would love to, you know, have sex with her.  Sure, I understand that.  There's nothing like that.  Here's a very sad phone call.  John in New York.  John.  Worst radio ever.  Oh.  Well, thank God.  You can say that any day.  Well, thank God.  John can fucking, you know, make it better for us.  Hey, Ed. 
[01:12:30]  How many times have you yelled at people for putting on a visual on the radio?  Never.  Because we do it all the time.  We're a very visual radio show.  Why?  You don't have...  Look, look.  Hey, hey, hey.  Fuckwad.  You don't have a computer?  You can't listen to what I was saying and then punch it up yourself?  Because everyone has a computer or a phone where you can punch it up instantly and know  exactly what the fuck we're talking about?  Do you?  Drive to work.  Drive it all while you...  Oh, you never...  You never picked up your phone and punched the name into fucking Google images while you're 
[01:13:00]  fucking driving?  Crash!  Crash!  Burst into flames, you cocksucker!  Fuck you!  All right, I'm punching out.  All right.  There goes John.  Get a pole.  Or a Jew.  Or a Greek.  Care.  Oh, he banged our heads, Bobby.  I know, he did.  Kyle in Boston.  Everyone's saying she went to school in Boston.  Kyle, what do you got, buddy?  She did.  And I think this guy might be a fan as well. 
[01:13:30]  She's from Rochester originally.  Rochester.  I got the background on it.  Hey, Ann, have you ever checked out the one where she shows you, or shows chicks how  to make their tits look bigger?  No, I haven't seen that one.  Well, let's go check that one out.  I got to see that one, I guess.  Jimmy, you ready to check this one out?  Yeah.  Well, they're kind of hard to find.  She's got a few videos there.  All right, we'll find it.  Oh, see, Cancun.  No, find that one right there.  Oh, boy.  You didn't just do this.  No, no, I did.  You could have backed out. 
[01:14:00]  Most of you who follow my blog, www.sulala.com, or my Facebook.  Go forward until she's in a bikini.  I don't give a shit about this.  Yeah.  And I'm going to my video.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, look.  Yeah, she's fucking hot.  She's got a great body.  Yes, of course.  Look at that, right?  She's dancing around.  Look at that.  She's a great ass.  Great ass.  What a dumper. 
[01:14:30]  What kind of pussy bulge?  I don't know.  I can't see her pussy bulge from here.  This is a terrible video.  She's playing awful music, and she's dancing around in a bikini.  Sorry it's visual, but you can find it yourself.  I don't really go swimming. 
[01:15:00]  She has nice tits, too.  She doesn't have a nice...  I see she's definitely attractive.  She has an amazing body.  She has a great fucking body.  Yes.  Yes.  But there's a lot of...  You can see a lot of that on the net.  Oh, I know, but there's something, you know, a little more unique.  It's not just her standing there showing off her fucking goods.  I got bad news for you, though.  Yeah?  She has cornrows in college.  She was taking a lot of black hair.  No!  She went to college in Boston.  She was taking a lot of black hair.  No, no, no.  You understand, some brother fucked the white out of her hairdo. 
[01:15:30]  No!  Yes, he did.  Some guy, some...  There was a fucking, a veiny black dick that changed her fucking hair.  No, don't say that.  She had cornrows because she probably went through that phase where she was kind of like...  No, she was going to, like, the Caribbean and stuff.  Exactly.  Yeah, the Caribbean.  No, but not like that.  I want you to change your hair, girl.  No.  And he sunk his dick into her slowly.  He got half in, then he talked to her.  No, there wasn't. 
[01:16:00]  I swear.  He let her body adjust to it.  The girth of it.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  I guarantee you, his fucking, his cock was like these fucking headphones.  In color and width.  No!  Let's get her on the show.  Yeah, call her up.  Yeah, we can call her up.  I want to see if she's ever taken the black...  She should be pretty easy to get a hold of.  Ever taken the black cock.  Yeah.  She has.  She's got 91,000 Facebook friends.  Holy shit.  It's crazy.  She's very popular.  She's a real sensation.  She's popular because she's hot. 
[01:16:30]  I was saying because she...  Of course!  Do you think I have any delusions?  Like when Danny said, if this was a big fat pig, you wouldn't even give her a second glance.  Yes!  It's basically, who's that fat pig from that singing show?  Eric.  Eric.  The singing show?  I don't...  No, I don't know.  The voice?  Who's that fucking...  What's singing?  That English broad.  That was a dog.  Oh, Suzanne.  Yeah.  Ah, Boyle.  This is like reverse Susan Boyle syndrome.  It's like, no one could believe that she had a voice because she was a fat pig. 
[01:17:00]  And this one, it's just like, oh, she's...  Look at the hot girl.  She's funny.  Right.  But if she wasn't hot, she wouldn't be funny.  If she looked like Susan Boyle, you'd be looking at it with the butthead face on.  What the fuck is this?  That's the whole thing.  What the fuck is this?  Because even not hysterically funny...  You're giving her too much because she's hot.  Yeah.  But that's just it.  Because she's hot...  Because you like the goofy part, too.  She shouldn't be like that.  But you like the goofy part a little bit.  Until Jimmy says something and then you back down a little bit.  No, I said the person I didn't like.  No, I wasn't backing down.  You went from being a huge fan of her YouTube channel to, ah, there's like three videos. 
[01:17:30]  No, no, you've got to spell it out for the listeners.  Why are you yelling?  Because they'll listen.  Why are you yelling?  You're panicking.  Because you're talking and I've got to talk over you.  No, you're panicking.  No, look.  Look, look.  Listen, listen.  Calm, Anthony.  Listen.  Calm, Anthony.  Explain.  I have to say this because the listeners will look at every video and think Anthony doesn't know  what funny is because these aren't funny.  And I had to say, no, they're not all funny.  Believe me.  I know.  I've turned a lot of them off. 
[01:18:00]  Even though she looks good in the videos.  You admitted that you saw ten videos, right, sir?  Yeah, I watched ten videos.  And you liked three.  I liked three out of the ten.  That's not a good percentage.  Why?  To like somebody.  And nobody looks...  That means you only like 30% of her videos.  But that means that she's batting 300.  Yeah.  But I wasn't saying...  And Anthony really liked five.  But he knew he couldn't say that.  He had to say three.  No, no, no.  I really didn't.  He loved three.  He liked two.  No, no.  He loved three.  If you had said to Anthony, vote on each one, a couple of them he would have went, that's 
[01:18:30]  good.  But three he would have went, that's fucking great!  Look how funny and goofy and hot she is.  I can't believe I'm taking shit for pointing out a hot girl on the internet that I thought  was hot and...  No, the only reason you're...  Had some entertainment value.  The only reason you're taking shit is because you backed the fuck down.  You should stay strong and say, man, you love this girl.  No, I didn't.  For her goofiness, her funniness, and her hotness.  I didn't back down.  I said, yeah, she's hot and goofy. 
[01:19:00]  What video did you like that you thought Jimmy was going to like and it just didn't work out  for you?  Um, you watched ten of her videos?  Yeah.  What the fuck did you do that?  He set you up, you idiot.  What the fuck did you do that for?  He set you up.  Even the big one that got 17 million views, which I thought was definitely clever.  I could see why he hated it.  I didn't hate it.  I could see why people would enjoy it.  I'll be honest.  I didn't mind the makeup one.  I like the things to do when she's not cleaning her room.  If Anthony hadn't talked her up like she was fucking Sarah Silverman, I probably would 
[01:19:30]  have enjoyed it more.  Wait, Sarah Silverman wouldn't be funny if she was a fat fucking pig either.  Oh, shit.  No, here's why she would, because she's mean.  Sarah's mean.  She does fucking mean jokes.  I think she would be because her humor is very fucking mean and racial.  I would have to agree with Jimmy.  I think, yeah, I think she...  Sarah's mean enough.  The hotness confuses everyone.  But you honestly think...  She's definitely funny.  Aside from Roseanne, do you think any fat bitch comic being mean is entertaining?  I look and want to say, ew, you're a fucking pig. 
[01:20:00]  Don't be mean.  You're a slob.  Lisa Lampanelli?  What?  Lisa's funny.  Lisa Lampanelli.  She's funny and mean.  You kind of just described Lisa Lampanelli.  She's funny and mean.  But you don't like mean?  No, no, I like mean.  But it's just because a chick is fat.  It's only if she can pull it off.  What is happening to Anthony today?  You just described Lisa Lampanelli.  She's like, oh, Lisa Lampanelli?  You go, no.  No, let's see the one he likes.  He might be right.  No, it's things to do.  So if someone is really ugly like... 
[01:20:30]  Instead of playing in your room.  Wait, so if someone's really ugly like Lisa Lampanelli.  Right.  But she's beating the shit out of everybody.  But that's an anomaly.  That's an anomaly.  Like this.  Oh, fuck.  This to me is an anomaly.  That's a great game to play when you pass go with the car.  No, it's not.  It's a monopoly, Chip.  An anomaly.  This is another video you like.  Let's see this one.  Of a legendary bloodline.  Things to do instead of cleaning your room.  Okay, cool.  Okay, so for anyone that's never been to my house before...  She's so funny.  Shut up, Danny.  Like a hot mess. 
[01:21:00]  And I'm also like the best procrastinator of all time.  Right now, I think I have maybe like the dirtiest room on planet Earth.  Like, it's just full of crap.  It shows the crap on my room.  And I really don't feel like cleaning it.  I don't.  I don't feel like cleaning it.  I don't feel like doing my laundry.  I don't feel like doing any of that.  So here's a list of things that I would rather do than clean my room.  She's wearing a dog on her head.  Double lions. 
[01:21:30]  Beer smoothie.  Banana face.  She put a banana on her face.  Popcorn hands.  She's got popcorn in her hand.  Peanut butter face.  Peanut butter and jelly face.  Peanut butter and jelly toilet paper hat face.  She rubbed peanut butter all over her face.  Chili face.  She put chili on her.  How about she rubs peanut butter on her pussy and the dog licks it off?  That would be funny.  Well, now that I would enjoy, too.  You got funny goggles on, man.  You know what?  It's 2 o'clock in the morning. 
[01:22:00]  You got funny goggles, dude.  All the chicks have left and she's telling jokes and you have funny goggles on.  And then the stupid funny goggles.  No.  You got tricked.  You got tricked into the fact that she's really hot.  But you don't find it at the least bit entertaining that she's doing goofy things  that she'd rather do than clean a room.  And most of it entails rubbing foodstuffs on her face.  You know what I want to see on her face?  Come.  Mine and a bunch of other people.  Well, yes, but when that's not happening. 
[01:22:30]  Dude, if a fat chick was doing that shit, you would say it's the worst video you've ever seen.  That's why funny goggles.  But I know that.  But you know what?  Ant likes goofy.  But it's not.  Wait a minute.  He doesn't talk about it often, but he likes goofy.  You guys don't understand.  You're bringing up that if a fat girl did this, it wouldn't be funny.  But that's the thing.  The girl that looks like that is not supposed to do anything funny.  Hey, I looked out for her.  She was rubbing green beans on her face.  I got her out of the problem.  I say, you know something. 
[01:23:00]  You got to clean your face.  Oh, my good God.  What part did you like banana face?  I like banana face.  She was funny.  This is a part of Anthony that he doesn't talk about often.  It's edited.  He likes goofy.  And the way it's edited very quickly.  She does it.  It's put together well.  I like her videos.  And Jenna Marbles sitting in a tree.  Shut up, Jimmy.  That's what that is.  We got to get her on the phone now.  Someone knows her out there.  She's got to call this fucking show.  We have a little bit more, Danny.  There's only a minute left in the show.  Little punch. 
[01:23:30]  Bake a Kermit.  She's putting the dog in the oven.  Bake a Marbles.  That's another one.  Make baby food.  Eat chocolate.  She's eating.  Smoke chocolate.  Throw up from smoking chocolate.  Cry about your life.  Peanut butter dog face.  Dog's looking at her face.  Snort chocolate.  Throw up from snorting chocolate.  Turtle backpack.  Turtle spin.  Cry about your life until you throw up.  Hold on.  There's more. 
[01:24:00]  That's good.  This is one of the funny ones.  Please be quiet.  We're enjoying this.  It was a productive day.  If you guys like this video, make sure to subscribe to my channel.  Subscribe to her channel.  You didn't like peanut butter face?  Peanut butter dog face?  Chili face?  Banana face?  No.  I prefer black face.  Fucking minstrel show would entertain me more than this.  Exactly.  She should put an M80 in her cut and sing Minnie the Moocher. 
[01:24:30]  That I would enjoy.  You're done.  We make new videos every Wednesday.  We're learning that Anthony likes Goofy, so we got Mike on Long Island.  Mike?  Anthony.  Mikey.  Dude, did you think Bubba was this funny in Forrest Gump and he was just listing all  the different kinds of shrimp you could make?  No.  No.  How do you find a peanut butter face, candy face, shit face, banana face? 
[01:25:00]  This is not funny, dude.  Well, banana face was kind of funny.  Yeah, because she had the banana.  You couldn't see.  She looked up and there was like a banana peel on her face.  Whoa, what's going to happen next?  Exactly.  I wish she had fucking car bumper face.  Fucking suicide bomber face.  God, you're lame.  He's not lame.  You know, he's just showing a little side of his personality.  You try to bring something to the program.  I was just like stumbled upon this and watched some videos and thought they were entertaining 
[01:25:30]  for a girl that is attractive.  It's very hard to look at that and see them as being funny in any way, shape or form.  You could punch up any video and see a girl taking loads of cum on the face, fucking,  socking, standing there naked, doing anything.  But, you know, and then she's doing something like this.  It's something a little different.  There's a reason you can find a lot of those and only one of this.  Because those are entertaining.  Nobody wants to see a banana on a girl's face. 
[01:26:00]  But that has a cock in it.  But that has crazy fucking hits.  He likes Goofy.  He does.  I know.  But it's just got...  What was another one you like?  What was another one you like?  What?  What was another one you like?  Let me think.  What was another one I like?  Another one you thought was funny.  All right.  Let me think.  I'm trying to think.  I like that.  And the boys are working hard to get Jenna Marbles on the phone.  I'm trying to...  Hold on.  We're trying.  I'm trying to think of the...  I can't...  You know what?  Really?  Were those the three?  None other ones are really standing out.  I didn't watch them all either. 
[01:26:30]  So there might be some that I had missed.  That might have been funny, but...  Yeah.  You know.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do, man?  We like what we like.  Yeah.  Jimmy didn't like the first one.  The first one, I didn't mind.  I...  I remember when...  I...  I...  I...  I love you just yelling.  It's like you're falling apart.  But it's because, you know, I'm trying to get my point across. 
[01:27:00]  And it doesn't seem like it's ever getting across.  Just seeing a picture of...  People just keep crucifying her.  Seeing a picture of her, that's your type.  No doubt in my mind.  Well, but...  But...  See...  If she was fat, I wouldn't even fucking watch that.  Yeah, I know.  So there's got to be the attractive angle first.  Yeah, we know.  Nobody's going to explain.  I like what you like.  It's just...  Okay.  Ah, ha, ha, Jimmy. 
[01:27:30]  Shut up.  I've seen some internet shit that you thought was good.  I agree.  There's a lot of internet stuff.  I like the quality of this.  It gives my voice.  I put my Starbucks lid over my phone.  Right?  You didn't get it?  Mike.  Both of you.  What?  You.  You like what you like?  Danny with his Lisa Loeb fucking chicks.  Enough of you.  She's hot.  You like what you like?  Enough of you.  We're not saying that...  I don't say she's funny.  Exactly.  Yeah, I never said, hey, put on this fucking tranny.  There's knock-knock jokes until his dick falls out. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, we all have weird fucking tastes.  We get it.  But we kind of try to not talk about it.  It's fun, everybody.  I don't know.  We should take a break because we got the very funny Jim Jeffries outside the studio.  Yes.  Very funny and attractive.  We thought we had her, huh?  We're going to get her.  We'll get her.  We're going to get Jenna Marber on the show.  She's probably just out or sleeping.  She likes the attention.  She'll fucking do our show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You'll get to talk to your sweetheart there.  It's not my sweetheart. 
[01:28:30]  I'm just saying I thought she was attractive in her videos and I found them funny.  Fucking Jimmy Fallon had Keith Richards on it?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, fucking Lauren knows those guys.  Damn it.  Man.  You would think he was a bum.  A bum.  If you saw that guy walking around the streets and you didn't know it was Keith Richards,  you would think that guy's homeless.  He looks like a great interviewer, too.  Oh, yeah.  His book is fucking amazing.  Hey, what does your girl think of Marbles?  What does she think of the Jenna Marbles?  Let me see.  She goes, she's not funny. 
[01:29:00]  And I said, I think she is.  And she wrote, ugh.  Your chick is right on the line.  And then she goes, you think she's hot.  Yeah, well, that's obvious.  And that's a given.  And then that's when the messages stopped.  Why?  Do you think that you don't think you talk to her like you're talking to us?  Like you think you talk to her like, hi.  Hi.  I like when Ant talks like sweetly to a girl.  Hi. 
[01:29:30]  I'm Tony.  Shut up.  I like baloney.  I like when teenage boy Ant comes out.  I'm being tortured here.  We got to get a montage of those.  Yeah.  I was just trying to be, yeah.  We were working on it, weren't we?  Hi.  Hi.  Trying to bring a little something from my personal life, from my viewing last night.  You know, we talked about The Wire.  I watched that.  We talked about this.  And all of a sudden, I'm an asshole.  Everyone forgot about E-Rock because of this hour. 
[01:30:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Now everybody's telling Melissa to put a banana peel on her face.  I don't know.  We got to have hot girls just putting banana peels on their faces now.  That's the new bit.  Come on in and do that for it.  Can we take a break for Jim Jeffries?  Yes, of course we can.  Oh, you scared me.  I thought we might have had Jenna Marbles.  The big get.  The big get.  Get out of here.  And Lance Burton will be in here. 
[01:30:30]  Great musician.  Hello.  Magician.  What is it called?  Make-believe?  Nah, we'll figure it out.  Stay there.  Follow the Opie and Anthony show on Twitter.  Twitter.com slash Opie Radio.  Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And Louis Jimmy Norton.  Twitter.com slash Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  Look who's in studio.  Our old pal Jim Jeffries.  Hello.  Jim was telling me that it's been eight months. 
[01:31:00]  I can't believe that.  I don't know.  It might have been slightly less, but it feels like a long time.  It seems like you were here just, I don't know, maybe a couple months ago.  I like how when you saw me, you said with a full head of hair.  With a full head of hair?  It's growing in.  The papilla is really kicking in.  It's growing.  It's growing.  Something's going on up here.  There's no product in this either.  This is just a natural lock.  That is.  Like, I would say locks, just a lock.  Just one in the front.  Good job.  How's your surgery?  It was good.  It worked.  It took.  It took?  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  He's got a full head of hair.  Yeah.  Cover with a hat every day, so I could, you know.  It looks natural to us.  I don't know what the fuck.  It actually worked.  It was amazing.  He got a good one.  We would love to beat him up, trust me.  But it looks good.  It was amazing.  I'm still thinking of getting one, just in case.  Or I'm thinking of growing a preemptive comb over.  It's starting now.  So you have it, so people are used to it.  But yeah, people know that you're doing it.  Where have you been?  Are you traveling the world still?  I just did some gigs in South Africa. 
[01:32:00]  That was pretty awesome.  Cape Town.  Cape Town, Johannesburg.  And the thing is, South Africa is one of those countries, if they just tell them that you're  a celebrity, they'll believe you.  You know what I mean?  So I go over to this animal park, and they're just like, do you want to get in with the lions?  And I'm like, sure.  And the safety just involved a woman with a hat hitting it on the nose, going, get off  him.  And then it's like biting your leg, going, oh, the lion is playful today.  Oh, really?  I've seen videos where that goes horribly wrong. 
[01:32:30]  Siegfried and Roy were playing one day.  Yeah, yeah, just playing.  For years, they were playing with the lions, no problem.  We said this, though.  You get out of this country, you get to do some shit.  You get to do some really cool stuff.  Did you get to feed the lions with, like, little pigs or goats or whatever?  Well, to tell the truth, they only really handled the baby lions, but there was a tiger there  which is an indigenous to it, and the tiger, much more fun than lions.  Yeah.  Lions aren't as sociable as a tiger.  Yeah, we had baby tigers up in our studio one day, and it was hysterical. 
[01:33:00]  Nine years ago.  Yeah, that was a while ago.  Wow.  They were, you know, kind of bigger than a cat.  Yeah, they're a tiger.  And they were rough.  Like, you want to play with them?  And then you realize, you know, this thing's drawing blood.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, with every little swipe it takes.  And they've got those retarded paws.  Like, the paws come fully grown, and the rest of the body's, like, small.  Yeah, yeah.  And their claws are just still, like, razor sharp, and they whack you with it, and you're bleeding. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, yeah, they use your face like a ball.  Yeah.  But I did that, and I've, you know, apart from that, I've just been dicking around the U.S. as always.  Yeah.  You know.  Your podcast, where can people get your podcast?  Oh, the podcast, just type my name into iTunes.  It's me and Eddie Ifton.  It's called Talk Shit, and it's doing okay.  Yeah, people are loving it.  It just started off as, we were doing one in the living room.  We had a guy that was sleeping on the couch at the time, who was never intended to be on the show, 
[01:34:00]  and he's become, like, the focal point, just a mildly retarded bloke that we know.  So, you got me two Red Bulls, Roland.  Oh, Roland.  Oh, Roland, yeah.  And matches with my cigarettes.  You got cigarettes and Red Bull, and obviously you're not drinking still.  I'm still not drinking.  I've slipped up six or seven times in the last sort of eight months.  Yeah.  But for the most part, I'm quite proud of myself.  But it's fucking, I miss drinking.  Yeah.  I like it.  It's fun.  It is fun.  But, you know, I can't handle the hangovers anymore. 
[01:34:30]  But my liver's fine.  I'm not shitting blood anymore.  And I had the...  Anymore.  Oh, that's what he said last time.  I know.  He was forced to stop drinking.  Someone says, I'm not shitting blood anymore.  Yeah.  That's bad.  That goes to the W column.  When I first told the doctor, I actually said to him, I'm shitting blood.  And he went, that's not good.  And I'm like, yeah, that's what I thought.  That's fine.  I saw that as a red flag straight away.  But now he's saying the liver's all right? 
[01:35:00]  The liver's fine, yeah.  Allegedly.  You know, just keep on drinking.  The liver will come back for you.  Yeah, it's a vitamin.  I just kept on drinking water, and it was all right.  Flushed it out.  Flushed it out.  It is odd.  It's a regular side.  You'd think a big one would be able to handle more pressure.  But, you know, the enlarged liver is the weaker of the two.  It is odd when you stop drinking for a little while, and you're just drinking water, and  you realize, wow, I kind of feel good in the morning. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, that's interesting.  Were your hangovers awful?  My hangovers are worse now, if I do it.  It became like, for the longest time, for maybe five years, that was what morning felt  like.  And I didn't even see it as a hangover.  I just go, oh, you feel shit when you wake up.  That's morning.  That's morning feeling.  At night, you feel sleepy and belligerent.  In the morning, you just feel like a bag of shit.  And now it turns out that, you know, it's only a little bit like that. 
[01:36:00]  Are you a puke man?  No, I've never been a vomitor, no.  Wow.  No, no, I always never vomited.  Puke can help you out, as far as that goes.  Look, sorry, but I'm a blackout guy.  Oh, really?  I would black out not knowing I'm done.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Which is funny, because when they do the mammy thing and they call it blackface, or something  like that, in the rest of the world, they call that blacking up.  Oh, yeah, right.  And so I used to do a joke that'd go, oh, I used to black out and not know what I've  done.  And I'd go, still better than blacking up and not knowing what you've done.  And I used to do it in gigs over here, and everyone used to stare at me. 
[01:36:30]  What does that mean?  I'd be singing mammy, trying to explain the joke.  Now, blacking up, they wouldn't know what that meant.  That's a better term.  What a black face.  What type of term is that?  I get, like, these retroactive hangovers, where I could be okay, like, until three in  the afternoon, after drinking, like, that previous night.  Right.  And then three in the afternoon, I start puking.  Yeah.  And the head hurts, and full-blown hangovers. 
[01:37:00]  What the fuck happened?  I do get the bile, where you're wandering around the street, and you're just coughing up,  like, there's water dribbling.  Like, some, you've been deep-throated in prison.  You know what I mean?  It's just coming over your chin.  I used to get that one.  I used to, the weird thing is, I never, if I took coke, I'd never get a hangover.  Really?  But, the depression the next day.  Oh, too much.  Like, I'd hate myself because I didn't have a hangover.  You deserve to get one.  You're a horrible person.  You did coke. 
[01:37:30]  Now, the, well, that's good for you, waking up and feeling good.  I was saying to Anthony when I came in, because I'm getting my, I'm going for my green card,  so I've never taken coke.  Of course not.  And I, um, I, I had an AIDS test, right?  And I think, after all the toilet seats, I've sniffed drugs off.  I've got to have something, right?  And I come back all clean, and it's weird when you act surprised when you give the test.  Like, the lady's like, what, you didn't think you would?  And you're, like, sweating, like, oh, that's fantastic.  Are you really? 
[01:38:00]  Like, now, how accurate are these tests?  You start questioning the test.  I'm starting to believe you can't get AIDS.  Because I've put, I've put a lot of effort.  I've put a lot of effort into getting that disease.  You know, if I can, having sex with a stripper in Kansas and a toilet with it.  You know, like, something's got to happen.  Listen to Jim Jeffery's kids.  You can't really get the AIDS.  You can't get AIDS.  I think I might be immune to it.  But I've got a certificate, and I live with another comedian who's never had an AIDS test,  Eddie, if so, so what I do is I've convinced him that he has AIDS, and I've hung my AIDS 
[01:38:30]  notice on the bathroom door so that he wakes up to it every day.  He's got to look at the fact that you absolutely don't have it.  He works out for, like, three hours a day, but I've convinced him that he's getting thin  for other reasons.  What a dick.  Yeah, and he's a weird guy.  Oh, he's a neurotic bloke.  Neurotic guy.  He does work out a lot, right?  Oh, yeah, hours a day.  We're looking at your talking shit page, right?  Yeah.  You make a few, uh... 
[01:39:00]  You're making a little...  It's starting to come in.  It's starting to come in.  They say some little scratches.  They say some scratches.  We're starting to pay more attention to this shit.  Yeah, it's this podcast thing.  Yeah, there's something going on.  Yeah.  There's something going on.  That's good.  It's fun to do, too, isn't it?  Well, yeah.  No, you don't mind.  We had our, like, first porn star in, like, yesterday to record it, and she was just a cunt.  And she didn't want to talk about porn.  Ah, I love when that happens.  You know what I mean?  Fuckers.  We've had them come in here, and you're like, what do you want to talk about then? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, they've changed.  What the fuck do you want to talk about?  It's kind of sad.  Yeah, and it's sort of like...  And she goes, so you kept on asking questions.  And eventually, it always ends with the same question.  How did you get into porn?  Yeah.  And she was like, really?  You're going to ask that cliche question?  And so I said, well, what did you do before you were porn star?  And she said, a stripper.  I said, what did you do before you were a stripper?  And she goes, I was a waitress.  I said, how did you get into waitressing?  And then she, like, got pissed off, right?  Because I took the piss out of her or something.  And I thought, fuck you. 
[01:40:00]  I'd rather have a funny, fat chick in the room.  Yeah.  We've made them cry.  Not even on purpose.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They've just cried.  They just break down now on our show.  It is great when you think of the fact, though, that there's three guys just pounding them  about their porn career.  Oh, yeah, yeah, but don't be rude.  Have you been rude to the porn star?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you've upset her.  Yeah.  Have I upset her?  Really?  Really?  She made the decision to fucking take that first big, black cock in her asshole.  That's right.  It's a good decision. 
[01:40:30]  For those of us that enjoy cuckolding.  That's one of my new things, watching porn.  I don't know what it is.  Having guys film their wives being banged by black guys.  I don't know when that came into the world.  When the fuck was it?  I've never even been married.  And all of a sudden, I'm like, all right, I'm on this boat now.  This is me.  How did I get here?  Yeah, how did that start?  I don't know, but it's like a big thing.  It's a boat.  I want to get married just so I can get a black guy to fuck my wife now.  What? 
[01:41:00]  It's enjoyable about watching that.  I can't.  I don't care.  That to me is.  Granted, it's no peanut butter or banana on the face, but it is.  I don't know.  It's the humiliation angle of it, the taboo of it, right?  It's ever since I found out I couldn't get AIDS.  I'm trying to find a way to get AIDS.  To get AIDS.  Oh, okay.  Well, at least, you know, you're working at it.  Well, this is the thing.  This girl says she came from an agency that doesn't employ black guys.  Is that like a porn agency where it's just like, oh, it is white?  Yes. 
[01:41:30]  Really?  Utopia films.  You're still able to go home to your family films.  Dad will be only a little bit disappointed films.  I don't know if Dad cares at that point.  He's like, are you going to be taking white cum?  I hope.  Well, believe me, I think Dad would care.  There is a few porn stars that will only do that because, what's her name, Taylor Reign  or something?  She will only take the white cock.  White cock.  Because Dad said no.  You know what?  There's no problem with that. 
[01:42:00]  Why can't a girl say that?  I read an article yesterday with this controversy going on at the White House with this rapper.  Yeah.  Common.  Yo, it's Common.  And he said some bad shit about a trooper that was killed years ago and named his daughter  after the woman that killed the state trooper.  She's living now free or as free as he can in Cuba.  But, yeah, she's living down there.  She can't be extradited.  And I was getting into that yesterday and thinking, you know, and I completely just lost 
[01:42:30]  my train of thought as to why I wanted to bring that up.  Was the girl, did the girl really shoot the trooper or does he feel she's specially accused?  No, no, no.  She shot and killed the trooper.  Right.  And then she escaped six.  Right.  She escaped six years after they convicted her and went to Cuba.  Is that her name?  What the fuck's her name?  No, no, no.  It's some fucking really African name or some shit.  Well, yeah, that was it.  But the black-white thing, there was another article under that that some other people 
[01:43:00]  that were invited to the White House, this one black woman, was just going off about  how she does not like seeing interracial couples.  She does not like seeing her proud, strong black brothers with these white women.  It upsets her in a way that she and then she went on to explain how it's not racist for  her to feel that way.  It's something to do with a pride and it's this wince of pain that she gets that...  Wince of pain that she gets. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What about the watching?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But she's explaining it in this way that, you know, don't explain away your racism, fuck.  Don't explain it away.  You're a racist.  You don't like seeing your black brothers, especially the successful ones, because she  was saying this guy was a sports star and everything and he's with this white woman and  she gets all, like, pissed off about it.  You're being a fucking racist.  It's just like if I say I don't like seeing a white chick with a black guy, same fucking  thing but i get fucking crucified and called a racist for it and she gets this article in jet 
[01:44:00]  magazine uh with this whole explanation fuck you it's because it's like the fact that that guy i  don't care if that guy's invited to the white house but they wouldn't invite him the other  way around i would absolutely i'm just happy that guy called the white house because yeah well  because if it was the bush administration and they invited a musician that was or poet that  something and he was doing something on gay uh not liking gay marriage or uh interracial things  or something there would be such a fucking fuss about getting him get the fuck out he's not getting 
[01:44:30]  to the white house he's not doing that and uh they pull him but this was kind of this well okay we just  i'll tell you something i bet she backs out sorry to interrupt you oh they did believe me oh maybe  not the interracial i bet she uninvites the rapper she did oh he's been uninvited he's been uninvited  oh yeah yeah yeah a little too much could he read the invite yeah how about why how about she  stands by what she did how about she goes no i like this guy or whatever how about you if you're  going to invite somebody invite them and fucking yeah i got a lot of friends who are assholes who 
[01:45:00]  i'm still friends with who just do cocky things every now and then they uh it's it's like police week  too where you're supposed to you know look back at uh uh fallen officers and and this seemed to be a  slap in the face to the troopers and bedtime uh yeah yeah general and the guy um  you know he did say some nasty shit about the fucking trooper's dead left the family and  everything and he's going to fucking glorify it in some way shape or form and name his daughter  after this piece of shit fucking down in cuba go fuck yourself i was watching oprah the other day 
[01:45:30]  this is on the black white thing as well where you're going opposite racism or whatever there was  they were going on and on about how a lot of black women in america uh bleach their skin and even  bleach their children's skin oh sorry because they don't want to be like really dark dark they  don't want being like coffee dark they don't want to be dark dark and everyone was just outraged and  i stand up for black people's right to do that i think do it was the same as a white chick 
[01:46:00]  fucking fake tanning everyone wants this middle ground color yeah like my whole life people have  ripped into me for being pale like it's a disease or something everyone it turns out the whole world  wants to be slightly arabesque without the beard that's right that's true that is a great observation  why is it bad if a black person tries to lighten themselves up when white people are trying to  tanning beds every time there's no problem that's looked at something where you know you're trying to 
[01:46:30]  deny your race with the white people it's just like hey you look a little better with the tan  i want to look like i've been on holiday yeah yeah and with black people it's you're trying to  deny your race what does that bleach do to you health-wise you think when you're bleaching your  skin like that i don't know well health-wise oh he's getting a job healthy i think it is he was  there he was there did he perform common made it oh he did go yeah i guess well yeah there goes a few  more points on fucking obama's popularity but he's at an all-time high i saw that in the little 
[01:47:00]  thing for 60 percent all-time high yeah but he barely shoot in bin laden's face you'll be popular  for a week it shows how racist the country is he didn't go up that much after getting osama racist  it's fucking his policies suck a dick bin laden's also not the story he was five years ago like when  when when reagan brought the fucking wall down quote unquote it wasn't the story it would have been 10  years ago a big fucking story but it's also when you saw where he was living and like the environment 
[01:47:30]  he was in when he's sitting in front of his little i know it looks sad and you're there going it took  you that fucking long yeah to find that guy i could have found him on google maps if i just yeah you  know he's in a two up two down they go well they broke down the defenses really the guy with a gun  with a duct tape like laser pointer on top of it and you just broke in oh shit just shot his 18 year old  wife in the knee but i can shot his face in so it looked like fucking kim kardashian's kind of she  overgrew the thing pakistan saying they had nothing to do with it still pakistan all right 
[01:48:00]  no that's how you say they're pakistan pakistan that's how far she they're full of shit we didn't know he was  there for five years but we still got to give him three billion dollars and then the chinese want pieces  of that fucking stealth helicopter why can't we just go in and go look pakistan we give you three  billion fucking dollars a year give us our helicopter parts back you fucks we're dumb  we're dumb yeah we are dumb we should have fucking you know we should have done to tell them tell them 
[01:48:30]  look uh get away from the helicopter parts because we're coming to get it we're finishing it off  we're gonna bomb the shit out of that complex and blast every little helicopter part uh to kingdom  come that's right get the fuck out of there there's just gonna be a pile of little inoculated  helicopter parts helicopter parts yeah we should go back and pick up that shit yeah why not  yeah it's our shit technically litter and tell them they're bad at cricket as well  yeah they suck yeah you suck pakistan that's your only sport you dumb fuck so this is the thing with 
[01:49:00]  the the um uh in britain the most derogatory term that they've got is is pakky pakky yeah right  but in australia pakky's just short for pakistani like in the same way if you called me an aussie or  you were young right right but when i moved to england no one told me this no one told you that's  derogatory i was rocking around using the word pakky for about a year before i became uncomfortable  you're lucky to be alive oh you're the pakky bloke in the shop buddy ripped me off 
[01:49:30]  everyone just thought i was a racist which i was but i i normally i normally hide it better  who said george bush said it president bush said pakky yeah he didn't know either and he and he used  it and there was a fucking uproar because it is like saying nig is it yeah well the thing is they  use the word pakky and they cover like indian people and yeah you know it's it's very widespread but  in in australia they have like billboards when pakistan's playing um australia in the cricket 
[01:50:00]  we'll have billboards around the city that go the pakkies are coming right this is like oh get  excited australia the pakkies are going to be here in summer so australians don't give a fuck  because somebody else's racist words so stupid like you know what i mean like i think nigger is  universal like if you said that everybody knows that's a fucking racist awful word but but pakky  does not mean anything south africa call people colored knock yourself out really oh that's the 
[01:50:30]  term the black people like you have a black person can't you go oh the colored filler over there and  they're talking about a mixed race person right okay and and you feel like you're correcting black  people like you can't say that it's a really i don't know if anyone's told you but you can't call  people colored but then if you go into uh like new england and and stuff they call uh like convenience  store as a packie or a liquor store yeah i gotta go to the packie oh it's at a package store yeah 
[01:51:00]  yeah so it's like go to the packie that would be funny that i'd be able to go yeah i gotta go to  the nigger and go pick up some bread you know it's like it's it's a derogatory term but it comes  off as silly we're out of milk would you swing by the kike and grab something  god damn it go by the hook nose i need gum that is the derogatory term for a corner store in  in britain is the packie shop a packie shop right shop would be and that's derogatory that's rent  run by i guess uh but britain's all fucked up they call um that pakistanis and indian people that's 
[01:51:30]  what they call asians and they don't really have a term for asians they just call them all chinese  or something it's just chinese when you're over there the english don't give a shit does everyone  know what the english call and even a doctor will call will say this to you this is so commonplace  they'll just say it on tv what do you reckon the little hole at the end of your penis is called  in england um i think i actually know the term japs i 
[01:52:00]  japs i oh shit wow i got a bit of infection in the end of my japs i and as many as you can check  that out and they and like at first you go really what is this we're gonna use this and you're on  board within hours  even the doctor would use it like let me take a look at your japs ian  wow that's like i get you know what i guess people aren't as sensitive  nah ready to jump the gun and go freak out 
[01:52:30]  don't fuck the wedding up don't you don't have bad protocol  oh what's up with that royal wedding man you got any thoughts on that dumb thing  thing is i i do a column in a magazine over there sleep i i sort of i sort of no i sort  i sort of follow i sort of follow occasionally what's going on right yeah and all they really  give a fuck about is pippa pippa yes she's pretty fucking hot she's all right but like there was a  big debate over where she would whether she was wearing underwear in that dress yeah and whether 
[01:53:00]  whether that should be in westminster abbey an underwearless woman walking around showing her arms  that was the big thing her arms were slightly showing oh here is this the queen killed diana  let's put things in context right showing her fucking arms and i like how fucking uh i'm confused  by the people that say that they killed diana because it was a car crash so how no there's  there's a conspiracy no what's the conspiracy around that time she was causing a lot of trouble 
[01:53:30]  to the royal family i get it but in the end it was a horrific car accident in the tunnel so  get me to that point somebody no one saw the accident there's a lot of theories and  steer them into that column in the middle of the tunnel like that yeah whatever it took  yeah there's no guarantee she's gonna die doing that i know that's why i'm confused  fuck her up enough but they're they're gonna show the death uh video finally oh there's video of uh  uh princess diane dying that they've never shown and there's a documentary coming out oh yeah this

[01:54:30]  death so sacred like even though she was very loved but like why shouldn't the photo of her  the thing is there's a lot of stuff about that woman that they you know okay dodie al-fayed who  she was with yeah was a known coke taker like not just a little bit of coke but was a coke fiend for  like 20 years and like everyone knew at his house was a little mountain of it so you know allegedly  yeah you know oh no no it's a documentary you know like the only thing that that kind of did right  he was he actually won an oscar he was um the producer on chariots of fire oh really just 
[01:55:00]  invested in him because producers don't do anything they're just people who just dump money  and yeah they want their opinions heard yeah but uh his his father muhammad al-fayed actually owns  the football club that i go for fulham and was good friends with michael jackson so now fucking my  football club in the premier league has a fucking statue of michael jackson just like you know  whenever they make a statue of michael jackson there's always that what face do we use yeah  like like are we going to use the the before he touched kids the after is there going to be is 
[01:55:30]  there going to be a kid on the end of his fist in the statue what nose do you put on the day exactly  yeah though the wide young nose i reckon you have them like lego where you can just pop it off and  pop it like mr potato head yeah mrs potato pop in the old nose the new falling off nose you know i  can't watch any australian talk anymore because of you you brought up that you hate last time you

[01:59:30]  string it popped out and i guess it's supposed to slowly uncoil as he's pulling it out right so  you don't see the car but it just popped out and he flung it like a whip and went  i think he was like ta-da i am the great danton  he did a he did a hack he did a hack trick in front of us he had a fucking string obviously in  his lower eyelid no he didn't it looked like it was so bad he swallowed it it magically went to

[02:04:00]  vegas and compete are you good at close-up magic um my my uh my main focus has always been stage  magic but i love close-up magic um and perform a little bit but but uh mainly as a stage performer  for the last 30 years i i i wish i was good at magic  i i think we all wish we could imagine i tried it a bit when i was a kid but i got shaky hands 
[02:04:30]  yeah you can't have shaky hands that slide a hand thing is just impossible you can't like  hey michael j fox isn't like it's the queen of hearts  you always look like you're holding something when you're trying to  not look like you're holding something it's uh that's why it's such a talent to watch somebody  that's really good at it because uh you realize it's not easy to do it takes a lot it takes a lot  of uh dedication and practice uh to be really good at sleight of hand and you need like a personality 
[02:05:00]  you need to be able to exactly misdirect people with what you're you're talking facial expressions  they'll move your eyes something you can't just stand there go don't look at this hand  unless that's the misdirection that's that's that's the trick to magic is you you you spend a  thousand or ten thousand hours practicing something and then you want you don't want  people to know you're doing it yeah you have to forget about it and then can't awkwardly throw  stuff away from one of your hands on the floor in the middle of a magic trick and isn't it a  tempting thing to to tell people how you did something when they're so amazed at it i mean i think 
[02:05:30]  it's tempting to the person to ask how did you do that uh for the magician to be like you know i did  that you you you know it's not because most people in their imagination they're thinking of  something much more wonderful than what it actually is it always turns out to be something  really stupid and real easy and if you show that to people they'll look at you and go no no no that's  not that that would never fool anybody yeah yeah then you're looking for it there must be some level  of joy in uh the fact that i i got away with that you know what i mean like they didn't see 
[02:06:00]  that's that's part of the skill is actually actually fooling the other person right right yeah yeah it's  kind of like being a criminal yeah look every time i get off stage after doing stand-up first  thing that goes to my head got away with that yeah we do that with this radio show get the chicken run  right if they only knew had they just been robbed i've told those jokes a thousand times  we should talk to the kids a little how many hours a day how many hours a day do you to get i know i  they showed your routine i think uh andrew is your name andrew i'm sorry derek derek and what was it 
[02:06:30]  like uh five hours a day that you practice yeah five hours a day for seven days a week  oh it's like you ever not want to do magic um really early in the morning really early in the  morning there's there's days where it's like no no magic today and then i'm like the other days i'm  like magic all day but the nice thing is that you definitely you know at this stage in our career we  have complete creative control in in most arenas so we're able to kind of vary things and work on 
[02:07:00]  different routines different days so that things stay fresh what were you doing uh like before  the the movie obviously they're being born like no no  this is kind of a big step up for i would think being so young and at the beginning of your careers  this is kind of a big step up where were you coming from before this well for me i mean i was  part of the magic castle junior program and i'd been so i've been performing at the magic castle okay 
[02:07:30]  um and having you know a lot of private gigs in in los angeles and um you know around around the  country um working at or performing at world magic seminar with a teen competition and uh other  competitions around really see i was let me let me let me let me read this um there uh is my  girlfriend checking in she goes a guy named david minkin yeah uh did a magic trick that ended in him  giving me his phone number what a creep 
[02:08:00]  so uh who's that who's that guy  this is two days in a row i know you asked the girl you didn't even ask the boy so who's that guy  trying to slip you the phone number with a little magic trick or something  david's got a really great act he um he performs at the castle apparently he does  he's got a nice show in malibu too that's where i grew up yeah how old is david i i think i think 
[02:08:30]  he's in his later 20s is he handsome oh he's lighted 20s is he handsome he's young he's handsome  let me ask that question is he dreamy  but no he's a handsome guy how come she told you that uh well she always tells me crap like that  is that recent i didn't know you had a girlfriend when did this happen i was uh about a year ago it  started up i guess yeah but see he's doing the trick backwards yeah see he didn't think this  through the trick should be you have the girl write her phone number down and in the course of 
[02:09:00]  the trick here write your phone number here and tear the card up and burn it and then i'll read your  mind and now you have her number the trick i always do is i always write my phone number down then i have  sex with him and in the morning the phone number's gone  i i'm not i retired in september yeah wow um i didn't know that that's that's that's how i'm be able 
[02:09:30]  that's why i'm here in new york you don't need the money that's for sure you've got some big  contracts out there uh i i've uh been professional magician uh 30 years 15 000 shows you look good  for good 15 000 shows 15 000 shows and i retired in september why did you retire you just finally  had i've just he did 15 000 shows i mean but if it's your love like why would you retire from that 
[02:10:00]  was it the grind of it i love i love performing magic i love doing it but you know i was just  like i've got other things i want to do now like what um well this this i'm happy to be here to help  promote make-believe it's a wonder it's a wonderful film we forgot about that already  um crazy and you know there's more to life than just uh you know going every day to the theater  and doing a show are you friends with copperfield yeah i know i know i know david copperfield um  not real well he didn't ask you that i've known me me and jeffries both saw copperfield in vegas 
[02:10:30]  it sucked balls we hated it yeah it was terrible oh look at those guys are losing it on the couch  you guys like copperfield we kind of things uh we kind of think he got lazy me and jeff i saw him  when i was a kid and i was very impressed because it was the whole big arena type thing and his tv  stuff was amazing the tv stuff but this this show that they have i think it's the mirage  mgm mgm yeah shocking i haven't seen it in years i remember seeing it when i was younger and liking it 
[02:11:00]  but he did a lot for magic you remember when he used to get his hands and go like that and there'd be  smoke and he did the big i'm magical thing he literally finished some of these things by going  but you know what he has he has every right to do whatever he has every right to do anything  anything he wants i mean he has done so much for our art that you know if he wants to know that but  then let's say that's trash copperfield is like one of us listening to someone trash kenison 
[02:11:30]  yeah yeah saying saying george carlin got lazy  what do you mean he's carlin no he's smart he's not a bridge burner  i'm looking forward to a career in this thing you don't burn that bridge  the difference car if you do burn that bridge it'll come right back  the difference carlin didn't get lazy at the end of his career he was he was uh great right to the end  but i just yeah i was only yeah i was disappointed by copperfield lance that's all we're getting i just  don't get why if he's got an island and five rape victims why why why you would keep doing it why 
[02:12:00]  wouldn't you settle down all right all right in the legend island well he married claudia shipper  right yeah no he used to just date her that was never married to him yeah they just dated  i saw pen and teller i like them a lot i like i like pen and teller so damn awesome show they had  a very original uh lance knows those guys i think very well i know pen i think you spoke very highly  of you i think you're the best guy in the show a lot he he loves coming in here yeah pen and teller 
[02:12:30]  good guys i've i've been friends with them for 30 years wow you know still retired lance is still  the best in las vegas wow you really are you're not only not burning bridges you're building them  as we speak you're being a suck up when i was just  okay come on has a future in politics he does have a good career yeah these guys are all real good and  and uh wow in the movie they their tricks are amazing and and you know amazing it's it's it's a  really uh when you go in to see the film you think you're going to see one one type of film 
[02:13:00]  but at the end you realize you saw a completely other type of film there's a lot of magic in the  film and they and it is a competition film but it really has um this film really has a heart i think  because it's it's you you you see these young people going from adolescence and stepping into  adulthood you know you see part of that process during the film um it's got a lot of angles oh yeah  it does a lot of emotion because you know it's not easy a lot of pain do you have any other like 
[02:13:30]  aspirations as far as what you want to do a lot of pain want to be a couple of these guys and i  fuck it i was trying to talk but i'm sorry well jeffrey's popped in because i said a lot of pain  yeah but i'm not going to give it away it's like you've never seen schindler's list  it's not quite that painful just about every guy and and and girl on that couch is crying in this  film because it's you know it's a lot of work and a lot of emotion going on trying to  you know get the act just right well the stakes are high because i think we we care so much 
[02:14:00]  it means a lot to us and we've been working really hard and and we still are right and that's what  you want to do like as careers all of you you don't have any other thing in mind like i definitely  want to finish school i want to finish what type of uh classes what do you what do you want to  right now i'm in a in a class it's called the ethics of deception which has been really  fascinating from a magic standpoint and um talking i mean she's kind of exempted magic as as being  entertainment um but it's really that's harsh no no no from ethically you know condemning it or 
[02:14:30]  whatever um but it's really fascinating to to kind of you know grapple with and worry about the ideas  of you know what makes a lie a lie and what's deception and truthful assertions and it's really  fascinating is it judgments on deception or is it just basically pointing it out because i i taught a  class um a similar class um a similar class i just lied oh no that's a straight apply totally  different someone better study harder it's a different scene so no we are um definitely 
[02:15:00]  analyzing the issue and you know when is it when if it's okay to lie when is it okay to lie  if you're deceiving when is it okay well it's philosophy i'm sorry i'm sorry does it tie in with  philosophy at all yeah well i mean ethical theory is part of it as a guy that is the worst course you  want a girl wow yeah major might might make me seem a bit intimidating potentially but yeah oh  philosophy major believe me she'd know that neither one of us were in our 20s but she would point it out 
[02:15:30]  you're lying no i'm not i'm just gray hair look older for god's sakes can we please get back to the  dick jokes oh my god man i thought there was kids in the room so we weren't allowed to do them  anymore anyone prepared to do magic for us i am i got magic yeah we all got it i'm very i'm very  excited we would love to see some right now damn yeah jim said something jim said something before 
[02:16:00]  which is like it was funny but it was true it's like when you just suspend disbelief and it's like  i'm a kid like just i don't want to know how to do it i don't want to know i don't want to know  one one other question before these guys maybe do a few tricks uh the japanese fellow there  i forgot your name i'm sorry i'm sorry okay how did you just look at a piece of paper how did  he get discovered and how did the two kids from cape town get discovered i understand you know these  other guys are you know because you lived in the middle of nowhere in japan and all of a sudden 
[02:16:30]  you got discovered for this film uh i'm living in the in the mountain of the japan  right but i have a facebook  he was in the middle of nowhere he was in the middle of nowhere i'm like how the hell did  did you know he get on everyone's radar that he's a great young magician  i guess you're right yeah  i wasn't thinking that even the mountain people have facebook  anything more with that or it was just facebook  you know um the the the kids the kids that come to the convention every year uh we have maybe i 
[02:17:00]  think this last year we had like 60 kids at the at the the the the teen events and in the contest  so they they literally come from all over the world we it started 20 years ago which is kids  from america but now we have kids south africa and asia and europe and south america because of the  facebook what an idiot i am is it considered hacky or or trite for magician at the end to say 
[02:17:30]  tada because that's what everybody thinks nobody says that dude a lot of people it depends on the  context but where did that come from sarcastically i would guess you can do it oh yeah if you do it  ironically yeah but obviously there was a famous magician that did just that somebody some  yeah that was their finishing move who said abracadabra or was that that was no that was how they  opened the door the 40 thieves forget about me what do you know i was open sesame oh okay who's  abracadabra then someone knows the tada story it's a great song well i know like when you're young 
[02:18:00]  all the kids all the parents like oh it's so cute do you say tada at the end of your tricks  and then i know it's terrible and then you're like we were totally taught tada and then you're  like in your teenage years and you're like performing magic and all your kids all your  friends are like oh that's cool and you go tada and they go lame you gotta get a better finishing  word yeah you're not supposed to say it you're supposed to you're supposed to think it and you're  you're supposed to like your body's supposed to like symbolize this is what tada looks like 
[02:18:30]  but you're just supposed to just do it and then your mind go you know you should say something  horrible like at the end murder well so much to do a trick yes for jim jeffries and i i didn't  like this they love he's at first 16 year old now if i need both hands how can you put my stand  right there march magically grow a third yeah if you don't all right i need a cell phone um all right

[02:20:00]  the balloon to get it out of the uh here hold that no the other one and he's taking the balloon off  that's awesome that is amazing that was really pretty cool  right now my question is is that because i don't know anything about magic is that your original  trick or is that a trick that a few people are the great janton 
[02:20:30]  now that trick um is been released into the magic community and then kind of i take what i buy from  the magic community and i take it and make it my own right it uses a bloody double  i can't get the prestige out of my head today  what a dude great movie i love the prestige i watched it about 10 goddamn times it's fantastic  edward norton no that was the other one that came out at the same time which one's wrong with 
[02:21:00]  hugh jackman that's the prestige that's the prestige yes ah that was great that was amazing would you  let's see another i want more chicks i want more chicks he was holding the phone in the left hand  he pushed the balloon down on top of it and then the balloon went inside the well the cell phone  was inside the balloon in the balloon yeah i don't know amazing i don't either and it was right in  front of your face with no yeah handkerchief cover now my phone's not fucking working  hi guys hi hi i'm bill and i have my name is bill cook and i'm in the wrong meeting one two three 
[02:21:30]  four dollars the great thing about being a magician guys is you make four dollars yeah this is this is  per table tips uh the great thing about being a magician is taking something as little as four  dollars and do something absolutely amazing with it like uh changing them into four hundreds i mean  that's that's just that's right right in front of our face that's is that that's that's i'm gonna 
[02:22:00]  have to bring this to the bank and i will let you know where the where the fuck are the ones man  that's the thing that's the thing i can't get like a true child of wonder you know i had a kid say  that to me yesterday you know i mean that's that's new york where the fuck are the ones man i can't keep  them this way because they're made by me and not the government and they get right so i have to change  him back watch that's when they change right back to one two one two one two one two one two one 
[02:22:30]  you're fucking great man wow there are guys from other studios watching hi guys that's very cool  that's a fucking god damn fantastic amazing that's like this radio show we took five million  listeners and turned them into 200 when you're old enough to go to a bar that is going to be the  coolest trick when you're just dude i'm 22 he's 22 he's 22 so just when you're at a bar act like 
[02:23:00]  you're going to give the chick a hundred and then just go boom one no the first time i did the trick  i did dollars to 20s and i went to walgreens and i didn't have it was like a 15 bill i was i was  buying decks of cards because that's where we buy our decks of cards and uh i get to the counter  and i'm like i don't have any i can do the card or i can do the dollars and 20s trick so this nice  you know asian lady behind the counter i turn the dollars in the hundred and she goes  into the rack of cigarettes they all fall off the wall that's great in a strip club 
[02:23:30]  she refused to take the money she's like you get crank hard it's like a wizard it is weird  watching people react to magic though because some people react with this horror like like they back  away they almost fall over themselves like he just did yes exactly which screams the craziness i i had  a friend of mine that did some a similar trick to that many years ago they called the police on 
[02:24:00]  it he was at he was at a bar a restaurant or something he did he did some trick where he  pretended like he was printing money oh and to pay for his food the waitress went picked up the phone  called the police they came to the restaurant to interview the guy like the secret service or  it's a trick you dummy i gotta tell i gotta tell bill i've seen that trick many times by veterans  yeah i've never seen it like that before that is amazing thank you it's like that is amazing because  how he slaps it and they turn it to hundreds because i've seen it where they twist it and you 
[02:24:30]  kind of almost figure out what they're doing but you just slapped it in a turn look at every one  i know it's magic are they from around the who are they this is that's our next guest this is like a  magic fish tank if we had one ounce of courage we would go out there and shut the curtain and  their dumb faces that's the dude from hangover yeah i know i know i know i know i know he wants to  perform can we get one more trick yeah i think hiroki and kristen both wonders yeah i want to see  both of them both should be able to do it yes absolutely i don't even want to be on the show i just 
[02:25:00]  want to look at tricks now rocky hi i'm loki please call me hero okay hero yes oh he's looking at  jimmy is this your bunny he pulled a bunny out of my ear out of your rear two bunnies ripped it in  half wait whoa wait a minute could you open your hands yeah i got a bunny in my hand i bet her name

[02:26:00]  yeah my catchphrase is gonna be idiot  well you know seinfeld used to make a joke like that he said he never liked magicians because we all  we all had this era of you know hi look here's a coin it's gone you're a schmuck yeah  you know it's back you're an idiot it makes you feel dumb we kind of we work to not make you feel  that way well it doesn't work because we feel really stupid yeah we try not to really dumb  you're pushing up here with this room we felt really dumb before you got here uh the lovely 
[02:26:30]  kristin yes yeah this is something kind of new i've been messing around with this is um i brought my  carry-on with me and this is something my mother's been reading it's los angeles magazine i know  obviously you don't have that here but i figure it's kind of important because it tells us where  all of our parents are going so that we don't go there oh geez you know open it up it's really  just los angeles you are they've been los angeles oh hey yeah but open up to any page i don't want  to see where you're going this is something new oh uh the lights are kind of weird would you wrap 
[02:27:00]  the front around the back though oh no i see your page okay i'll start again okay just wrap the front  around the back because i don't want to see does anyone know what that means just flip it here yeah  oh that way that way that way yeah oh my goodness okay um oh are you toward the back there i am okay  um i need you to focus is there like an image on that page or something there are um a lot of people  i think um is this oh this is we mentioned los angeles but i don't think that's where people are in 
[02:27:30]  this picture there's no okay there's but oh i don't know if this is just the way your mind is working  or is there a really hot chick sitting there is there a lot of leg on that page there is okay yeah  that's okay it's not just you um i'm pretty sure though again keep focusing so we see there's some 
[02:28:00]  some guys definitely trying to get on on this this chick sitting on a couch isn't she yeah and this  is an ad this is an i think if you read the the top in the in the white print that's an advertisement  sure it is yes and that's for that's for las vegas it's taught what's talking about um it's actually  what is not an ad for different places where you can go in las vegas correct um like an ad is to  where you can find out more information about different places sure so i think that's the  random page that you just took wow and there's a doodle of a penis in the corner no no but probably 
[02:28:30]  with their advertising you know like alcohol ads now you see why i retired because i do not want to  compete with these guys for the next 30 years yeah they were really impressive lance she'd be so hard to  lie to in a relationship i would hate to date her ethics of lying class this kind of stuff you know  it helps a lot in life lying class and magic hey no wow i didn't mean to imply that she'd be happy to 
[02:29:00]  date me let me correct that before the twitter lets me know that was that's obviously is that a memory  trick is it or would you know i mean i have an obsessive personality but um yeah yeah sure you know  over analytical but that'd be a little a little intense do you date other magicians um i haven't how many of these  lads have asked you out be honest no these are derek's like my brother what's wrong with you guys  he doesn't want it to be that poor guy oh my god yeah there's never been a hotter magician  looking for getting on the ground level let me tell you something about derek yeah since since here 
[02:29:30]  since this film came out and started airing like on on showtime and now it's going into the theaters  uh derek and and derek has grown like like two feet in the last six months  uh derek went to the prom this year  a really cute girl i've seen pictures yeah just had it work out you know stud  it was good good it was good for as long as i've known kristen though i've always had a girlfriend 
[02:30:00]  but um i'm recently single i would so i would kill that guy yeah yeah so there's a connection here you  too could uh you know but i have some magic relationship doesn't work she's like ah they're  like brothers but they really are like family i've grown up with all these kids i mean i've been  doing magic since i was 12 and a half and all the all the junior which is you know considering how  short period of time i've been alive it's a long time as a comedian our community i think jim will 
[02:30:30]  agree with is can at times be now i completely disagree oh man mostly on the way up it's  bitchier on the way up then when you sort of establish it becomes a bit calmer but it's very  competitive and is the is the is the magic community of young people is it like that guy's  shit that guy does hacky no i mean we we love each other until we get backstage of the competition  no but even then it's not like i'm gonna be no no it's it's it's more or less um you know hey 
[02:31:00]  you're doing that oh great oh boy so it is there's a healthy sense of competition but again i feel  like we're just one big dysfunctional family totally from all over the place yeah all right well i like  the movie a lot and uh yeah make believe it was very impressive tricks yeah the tricks right right in  front of our faces too i know that's like that that the point blank magic is amazing man that's  amazing that really does get you all right lance burson where can you get the movie where can you  see it's amazing it opens up friday at cinema village in new york city okay um last night we had a

[02:38:30]  show  all right that was pretty cool man yeah make believe is the movie once again  hey let's say hi to justin bartha from the hangover part two in theaters friday may 26th  what's up justin hey buddy hey hey nice to meet you you don't even have to promote this  we're hanging out this movie doesn't need promotion sir we're on the air by the way we 
[02:39:00]  always do this no one ever realizes i'm quite excited by this filming of course i love the  first one i can't wait to see this but why he doesn't have to promote it it's going to do with  big numbers to come and hang out with you guys yes yeah of course it's an excuse you know what i  like about the new hangover film from what i can gather from talking to people they've put all the  other the the cast from the original film in it and just moved them to thailand so like brian  callen who played like the guy who ran the church in the first one he was in my house going oh no i 
[02:39:30]  just i'll run a strip club now with a few different characters with a big mustache on him yeah how  much did i make the first one made i haven't seen it everyone says it's hilarious and really funny and  it made like 400 million dollars 467 half a billion for a comedy worldwide yeah and it was relatively  these days especially cheap to make uh yeah originally so yeah yeah that's the biggest comedy of all time  financially yeah i thought it's all right was biggest already and r-rated is uh and that's 
[02:40:00]  you know a lot of people love r-rated comedies but they get so scared of uh chasing away uh some of the  audience yeah so you always cut out some of the harder shit and make it a pg thing uh i love r-rated  comedies and they're making kind of a comeback where you know you're seeing some of the nudity some of the  cursing it uh-huh it's a a lot more fun to watch i don't go for that i got something you can bring  the family as something you can bring the family to i'm like something involves an rv and kids being 
[02:40:30]  really upset about the trip only harry chapin is driving the rv something something where the dad  ends up on the roof comedy star yes and he's also killed on the lie driving so it's always good  jesus yeah this really a good r-rated fucking ballsy comedy is nice man this one the second  one is eve is really dirty actually really yeah first i mean the first one it i mean uh you haven't  seen it but it has a reputation of being a bit dirty but actually is a is kind of sweet and it's 
[02:41:00]  like a detective story but this one is very down and dirty oh yeah what happened with mel gibson this  we hear all these things he was supposed to be in and he wasn't and like what exactly happened with  his supposed cameo it was you know what it was just uh he just it just didn't work out like any  movie the people get cast and replaced and seeing schedules and this and that didn't work out it was  just uh i think it was overplayed in the press a bit i mean liam neeson replaced him and now liam 
[02:41:30]  neeson's not even i i i heard and i know because you you probably don't want to say this but i heard from  a very reliable source if that was the case i'd never get a movie now hang on i've never been in  a movie anyway but uh i heard that zach and bradley uh both didn't want to be on no that's not true at  all but they were cool with being on the first film with a rapist well that's it struck me as odd  about brikel so it wasn't that it really wasn't no i mean i i think it was just uh a lot the biggest 
[02:42:00]  thing i think is that there was so much uh press surrounding his life at that point and there  might have been a small concern that it might have overshadowed in some sense when we have to come and  do these shows even though we aren't talking about it anyway overshadowed the actual promotion for the  movie anyway so whilst in thailand did you bang a hooker i did it while i was out there i don't have  aids don't you and he doesn't have aids i don't know i don't have aids so i can say it i kept that 
[02:42:30]  secret for like six years and now that i don't know thailand yeah did you bring her with you when  i don't i don't have aids so huh i don't have aids so it doesn't matter now i do you get like a real  adult hooker i hope not like you know one of the fucking ones thailand yeah was it a 12 year old  it was a proper girl i was out there doing gigs you know was that the first time you've had sex  with a hooker that day that morning oh jesus oh okay so that uh that's uh i bet you was a high 
[02:43:00]  up producer you know i mean there's probably somebody some someone was someone behind the  scenes no it's just a normal girl man yeah i think we're talking about two separate things  wait a minute i'm not sure i sense a three's company episode  what it was in thailand though like you had to go to thailand yeah we all went to thailand i mean  a lot of the movie was shot in los angeles and then the whole uh we moved everyone to uh bangkok 
[02:43:30]  and then uh crabby beach is brody in that one brody's the best he's great a lot i a lot of  people have an impression of thailand looking a lot like this set for like full metal jacket and stuff  like that but i i know i just recently saw some video of there and it was it's kind of a nice big  city and everything and bangkok yeah uh it's a big city nice i don't know really the word to describe  it but it has some really it's an interesting it's packed and uh crazy very crowded yeah food's 
[02:44:00]  amazing it's cheap as shit man for like a dollar you'll get like the best street food in my opinion  and oh yeah and and that hooker and i i hear that high and a hooker oh that really shows whether you  know they take the straw they put it in and blow the straw the dart out of their vagina that's that's  light for for what that's really like what did you do you partake in any of those uh did i shoot uh  ping pong balls out of my vagina not shooting out of your vagina per se yes uh uh we did see some 
[02:44:30]  shows we saw some of the local culture yeah saw some shows what was the best show you saw marie  different they're different you gotta tell us you gotta tell us about one of the balloon off  his head it's amazing to watch you gotta tell us one show you saw sir uh well i saw the usual uh you  know um uh ping pong ping pong ball launch and then there were some other things that i saw that i  actually have blocked out of my memory that i can't even mention on on this show when i first went to 
[02:45:00]  thailand i got i got sex showed out like you know i got to the stage where i went enough you're like  you're not i just want to go to a regular bar where i can drink with regular and this this guy takes me  into a bar and i'm like this is nice i like this this is normal there isn't sex everywhere and then  he points up and it's a glass ceiling and it's just women with numbers written on their ass sitting  sitting on the sitting on the glass so you can shop for them like a lobster 
[02:45:30]  wow true true i got caught lying in one of those clubs it was fucking embarrassing  i told somebody something and then we're talking and i just slept i was like johnny ola took me here  johnny ola that's a good 1974 yeah great nice current reference i i would just pick lottery numbers  thank you ladies you know how bad you've already won yeah true you know how dirty a 
[02:46:00]  pussy is after not only has it been fucking a lot of people but it's been sitting on glass  you know dirty that glasses you know they don't wash it horrible yeah that's a job for window  that's that's the dirtiest thing  some guy pays  some sicko pays to lick that clean  some sicko yeah yeah really are we looking at that sicko what else did you do the glass looks  like your fucking windshield after a camel spits on it in jungle habitat  i think we're promoting this movie perfectly yeah hangover did you ever fear uh fear for your 
[02:46:30]  life or safety when you were there because that does seem like kind of one of those places  it's pretty safe is it yeah yeah and thailand in general by the way it's not just uh you know  camel spit it's a beautiful place i mean i'm not promoting time but it is beautiful like the  northern thailand chiang mai i mean there's amazing places in that how long were you there  uh a couple months and they and i was and then the other guys were there for even longer 
[02:47:00]  wow damn it's cool to be in a fucking big movie or if i get malaria or something uh no but i'd be  worried about that to worry about it but yeah water you get a bottled water worried about water  yeah yeah you gotta drink bottled water sure yeah and i have a huge stomach so you know everything  it's very difficult everything bothers me yeah everything bothers anything with any spice to it  yeah exactly touchy i would go there yeah i i don't know i'm i'm so xenophobic it's a weird 
[02:47:30]  fucking they have a they have a king they have a king and everyone in thailand  fucking loves him really everywhere yeah every if you could have the shittiest shanty  fucking hut and you'll have this ornate picture of the king well if you could go down and just pick  a girl from glass ceiling most countries i mean no no but like yeah no but i mean in england and stuff  then but you gotta i was on a boat and i made some joke about the king and the kind of almost kicked  me off this fucking boat like like don't you joke about the king and i was like really apologetic 
[02:48:00]  like sorry just get me back to shore i've never uh never been to anywhere like that he's a faggy  looking guy as well now now he is but on the boat he wasn't on the fucking on the boat he was all  like hey i didn't mean that don't disrespect they wanted to kick you off the boat for that kind of  strange so um who else is in this besides by the way this is how i knew the hangover was a massive 
[02:48:30]  movie because ozzy when he opens his shows does a very funny montage where he green screens himself  like into all the biggest movies of the year and it's always very amusing and that was one of the  ones really i was so annoyed because fuck i was zach is on the fucking screen with fucking ozzy  i was so jealous you knew zach before hangover right i've known zach for fucking before all his  fame i i we did it i forgot he was in a show called apartment 2f on mtv which i did stand up on 
[02:49:00]  and the sclar brothers it was their show and me and florentine did it that's fucking 94 95 maybe  oh jesus back in the beginning i just cursed to spice up a boring story that just proves that  whole thing that people always say like someone like zach galifianakis they act like he just  came out of nowhere like two years ago yeah and the cunt's been doing tv since 94. he's been around  for years no one really utilized him right i mean i you know yeah i was a fan of him since then too  but no one you know he was just put in uh shitty kind of uh things he was a weird guy he always had 
[02:49:30]  like an alternative act like he was always definitely different a different comic he was never like  everybody else i remember him standing in new york and he's like a little small guy with blonde  hair i think and then he just lost his fucking mind yeah what's some of your earlier works uh  some of my earlier yeah yeah that maybe you weren't um you know looking back it's like oh boy that was a  that was a ladder rung up or a due to pay well i mean uh well the first movie i ever did uh was a 
[02:50:00]  movie called geely so that oh yeah you can't go you can't go uh wow that's the jenna lord pay  yeah ben affleck vehicle  ran into an abutment that was the abutment yeah that was how how does that feel though because  that was getting trashed before it even came out uh  uh feels great to still be talking about it he wants us to move on i'm sorry i know he's doing 
[02:50:30]  the hangover too and you're like so geely who is the production manager we just got to beat  everyone down that comes in here so what you're in your words three months what was that like  the biggest movie of all time let's talk about his biggest failure of all time but the thing i'm just  trying to get the mindset when you when before the movie even comes out it's being trashed it has to be a  morale downer for the entire cast yes yes i will answer that yes well i mean yeah i mean no one 
[02:51:00]  sets out to make a bad movie do you try to put that that strong face on there with the rest of the  guys like hey it's all right once this opens what do you all just know like i was like was depressed  in my little apartment but sure you did some interviews about the film where you said it was  excellent with stuff like lied uh no i mean well it's it's uh i don't i don't know i mean you don't  say it's excellent you say you know i i actually don't think it's the worst movie of all time but 
[02:51:30]  yeah but uh you work hard you work hard you do you know just like your show you work for years on  something and right now you're promoting geely 2 which is uh coming out in boogaloo you can always tell  when an actor hates the movie they're in though when they're like uh so is it any good look  i had a mortgage when they always go to this sentence it was just great working with this  director well such a fun crew everybody was so nice service was fantastic good weather we should 
[02:52:00]  explain it justin justin the only time we get eight listers on this show is when the movie needs  help yeah obviously not right obviously not in this case but the the tide is changing but over  the years we had will willem defoe like holy shit willem defoe's doing our show right and the movie  turned out to be the biggest piece of shit ever yeah platoon right that stupid movie garbage  guy richie richard dreyfuss dreyfuss on like fucking dreyfuss finally doing our show but it was because 
[02:52:30]  it was poseidon and he was weird to the movie need to help dreyfuss in the room these days yeah  yeah yeah you can get him as a voice over for your life i remember he's changed since the graduate i  remember he was one line one line wasn't always this confident jim used to have problems you know what  are those oh yeah yeah you're right though dreyfuss was weird that day he's weird guy when did dreyfuss come  in here for the poseidon adventure the remake yeah that's it exactly yeah and you knew he was his heart 
[02:53:00]  wasn't in it someone forced him to do a little press for this damn thing yeah i thought there's  some you know i mean he did like this off off broadway show a couple of years ago where he  couldn't i feel like a bad way i suppose he couldn't remember the lines and like they turned it into a  reading instead of wow yeah yeah well what are you going to do at the end when brando they reckon like  on the island of dr monroe brando just monroe dr monroe dr marvin monroe the guy from dr marvin 
[02:53:30]  monroe the guy from dr marvin monroe starring jim j bullock but he couldn't remember the lines so  he used to put like cue cards on the other everyone's foreheads wow everyone thought it was great  acting and he was like going and then and then he ate the cue card i love that about brando that he  he just had such and he hated rod steiger and fucking he the night and he i'd love the fact 
[02:54:00]  that he was such a pompous fuck but he was so good you everybody hated him but he was  fucking he's just simply the greatest why did he use the jim norton of the acting he really was yes  the fucking uh the i can't even think of a funny comparison between me and brando except for the  end maybe when he tried to break into his refrigerator and get ice cream that's how  by the way his kids liked him he's wonderful at least he knew what to do with his hands when he 
[02:54:30]  was acting he sure did he fucking he choked that bitch and fucking streak on him desire  why did he hate steiger so much he just thought he thought he stunk he thought his acting was  fucking like math he hated those guys him and sinatra couldn't get along either there's a big thing  because sinatra used to do everything in like one take and brando used to take like 20 times they  got perfect yeah and sinatra used to call him mumbles hey he'll come back when mumbles is done  but in the bogarts i heard he because brando and those guys apparently had no respect for guys like 
[02:55:00]  bogart they thought they were old school and terrible and fucking one level you know in a way they were  they were right comparatively it was before the technique kind of came out yeah the technique how many  how many are you are you uh one take uh done ed wood kind of a one taken done that i wish do you  do you rehearse a lot because i hear a lot of like great actors i don't want to hear a lot because i  think because what is it clint eastwood says you rehearse your mistakes too much if you oh i found the  same ever oh go ahead jim go ahead jim no no no i thought i thought he was asking 
[02:55:30]  it depends on the thing the project to project did it come naturally like like  or did you really have to yeah yeah because i i mean uh not really no i mean i did like the  the whole school thing for all the years yeah yeah do you know it's hard to do when you act on the  midwest so i didn't like grow up in the thing i didn't really know what it all was in what we call  the business yes i yeah i didn't know anyone in the business business he looks really hard to do i  saw chris rocks play i thought he was really good i mean yeah motherfucker the hat yeah really 
[02:56:00]  fucking good bobby cannaval is great oh phenomenal dude and you couldn't see that chris like really  did belong on that stage which was nice because you know comics have such a bad reputation um the  only time i saw any anything with chris that looked uncomfortable and i i was looking for it was when  bobby cannavali was doing a monologue at chris and chris had to stand there and and and listen i could  see and it was such a nobody noticed it but i know that the most uncomfortable thing for me is to stand  with nowhere nothing to lean on or hide behind and have to listen to a guy talk it looked like he was 
[02:56:30]  standing like posed but yeah but it was such a minor thing like that's like the heart  that's a hard thing i think that's the hardest bit in acting because what are you going to do just  stand there because you practice your lines but you never practice when you're not doing just  juggle the comics just start juggling yeah or something or or overly gesticulate like oh  what's wrong with that i always find i always find like a scratch on my body like yeah that's a 
[02:57:00]  nervous thing oh you gotta scratch i don't know why in the middle of the fucking yeah what are you  doing natural yeah i'll be scratching everyone's sketches yeah everybody is scurvy in this i scratch in  general life because i i guess you don't realize like it's very hard to mimic what you do in real  life during a real life situation and bring that to acting because it seems like it would be easy  right it's like okay i've stood and listened to somebody talk why can't i do it and just like i'm 
[02:57:30]  doing it why can't i be a hooker right now as in thailand you can we'll get that young magician back for  you yeah i'm joking i'm joking but when you listen you don't move nobody moves when they're listening  you just kind of listen and it's talking about the big blood it's instincts it's instinct to  fucking nod and not die in the scene sometimes you listen quietly sometimes you like lean your hand or  you're you're looking or you might even just look away for a second look back you do but if you're 
[02:58:00]  acting it would be like mr fabasham but like because you're overthinking it because all of a sudden you're  overthinking it you're not just being that yeah yeah well i've been doing auditions at the moment  and who's sending out um i've been i've been doing all right but as soon as i can do the american accent  but as soon as i do it with the american accent i can do the accent fine but my acting goes out the  fucking window and all of a sudden i'm just hey my name's bob how you're going you know it's just 
[02:58:30]  fucking yeah wank if i can't speak in my own accent i'm yeah is that is how it is but how many roles  i've got nothing i auditioned i auditioned for the original hangover in that for ed helms role you  were too big a drunk  they thought this guy's playing drunk really good they don't want a drunk they want something that can  act that was a very organic american accent i'm surprised you didn't have part of the wire  god it's interest elba i always like because because i always i always look at like like when 
[02:59:00]  hugh laurie's on house and for me that sounds like a terrible american accent but everyone goes  because it's always like you don't have a problem there sir you have a you know what i mean like i  can always see it's like a british guy just over enunciating everything that he says oh yeah he's  a comedian very i didn't okay i hate him a little less i hate that show he spies it he uh you ever see  um blackadder blackhead or no okay blackhead is like a classic um rowan atkinson okay and he was  he was in that for years and he's also in a hugh and um uh laurie and fry with stephen fry i don't 
[02:59:30]  know if you know stephen i hate the way all these fucking pussies that like entertainment weekly think  he's amazing like he's this quirky character fucking assholes fucking lips with a cane i guess  that whole show goes like this it goes uh i have a problem with me we think it's that no  it's not we've figured out what it is that's the end every episode yes roll crap yes we figured it 
[03:00:00]  out thank god house felch that cadaver he saves everybody jesus you do uh any tv uh i have yeah  i have done a couple tv things you like it as as much as movies or uh yeah i like it moves faster but  tv's tough and that there's there's like a lot of cooks in the kitchen like there's like a studio  a network a director a producer everyone like thinks and it's all like everyone just wants to  make money which i understand but they're like if the show gets picked up then we're going to be 
[03:00:30]  millionaires so they just water it down and water it down for the most part the good shows that you  see it's usually because there's one guy that's brilliant that's running the show that people are  afraid of and then they just let him do what they want to do it's like it's like wiki jervais got away  with that didn't he because he was just they just gave him the money and he just yeah i wrote  i wrote a sitcom for comedy central it went through nine hands right but that was each time some can't  put a note into it right yeah make them a little bit more like everyone had to justify their 
[03:01:00]  job if you were just the person who passed it on i think it comes to a point though where you need to  be in the right place at the right time and have to be severely underestimated yeah in how people are  going to react to it uh that happened with even like seinfeld i mean you know that was a show  they're like okay do what you want and then uh like ricky gervais with the office on the office  like yeah do what you said it's one camera it's one room we're using one room and they were even  after whatever three years the office they were like this is going to fail i did a show when the 
[03:01:30]  office was like uh was uh like in the second year you mean the american version and yeah the american  version the british version they were uh for mbc and mbc was like oh we can't make your show single  camera single camera shows don't work we're going to cancel the office and this was like the year  before it took off and they're like it's a brilliant show what are you talking about dummies you know  and louis ck's show too that's like uh that's a show that i think they just let him do yeah yeah you  know we got some time a little bit of money here let's put louis in a corner louis in my opinion louis 
[03:02:00]  just so talented that eventually someone had to just go like just let him do what he wants  what he wants i love watching louis credits like i get a chill down my spine when i see louis ck walking  around with the pizza going written directed edited it's just like you got in a room and said you're all  idiots i'm a genius just trust me i'm gonna do this all by myself that's why justin's definition is  amazing because you're naming all the guys that had complete control yeah yeah as soon as you 
[03:02:30]  those are the the success you said louis ck seinfeld larry david ricky gervais they all no one  was telling you got too many comedians i mean even like you know red guys so obviously right you  know they still don't learn but obviously yeah that thank you no never you think they would learn with  all these examples of guys doing it correctly people want to keep their job i mean you under you  have to understand from their perspective people want to keep their job believe me we know we we look  down this hallway you get same thing justifying their writers who are just failed comedians these guys  who are just because you know they're not gigging so i can sit there and write all day and and like 
[03:03:00]  your agency gets you and goes oh here this guy's going to write with you and you're sitting in a  room with this bloke going you're a idiot what's worse than somebody what there's nothing there's no  greater sin than bad writing somebody who i hate collaborating with people i hate it because  so do we  no no no no i mean if we want to get into this now  if they have an innocent comment and real shit comes out like well you know whatever
