<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts detailing their struggles with their new, technologically advanced studio.  They recounted difficulties with building security, malfunctioning computers and TVs, and confusing clocks displaying multiple time zones. Opie complained about a terrible omelet resembling vomit, while Anthony described his early morning commute through a seedy part of New York City, recounting witnessing public sex acts and various unsavory characters.  Jim Norton joined in, sharing his own experiences with a prostitute and his exhaustion from a late-night comedy gig followed by the radio show, impacting his performance on "Tough Crowd."  The conversation also touched upon Paris Hilton's pornography film and a racial slur she allegedly used, Opie’s cold (potentially contracted from poker chips at Mohegan Sun), and the effects of high fevers on the testicles ("fever junk").  Throughout this segment, recurring technical difficulties with phones and sound effects were noted, along with the hosts' prediction of an upcoming fight between colleagues Ben and Steve.  They lamented their lack of sponsors and joked about potential product endorsements. Club Soda Kenny called in, offering constipation advice for Opie and promoting his shows.  Norton revealed he still lacked an XM radio, despite attempts to get one for free, and shared a story about a woman with breast cancer.  The hosts also discussed a Daily News review commenting on their relatively tame language on their first day back, and the broadcast ended with a musical tribute from Club Soda Kenny and plans for a "What's in My Pants" segment.


The following segment included discussions of a new Whipple bat, the Olsen twins' changing appearances, past conflicts with Howard Stern and Infinity Broadcasting (including potential financial penalties for mentioning Stern), a picture of Howard Stern's daughter, Billy Joel's wedding, and the "Sex for Sam" contest.  Anthony callously expressed hope that onlookers of the Mount St. Helens eruption would be harmed.  The show's location in Washington D.C.'s "Chocolate City" was also discussed.  Blind Dave, a frequent caller, was a studio guest and shared stories about his blindness, his girlfriend (which spurred numerous offensive jokes), installing his XM radio, and a past blind boxing incident with Opie.  The hosts played "Guess What's in My Pants" with a female caller, Katie, involving sexually suggestive descriptions and sounds.  The show also included criticism of their agent, Bob Eatman, who disliked a character named Frenchie and disapproved of the show’s language; a discussion about an expensive lobster dinner with Eatman; calls from Rich Vos complaining about a prior appearance; sexually suggestive sweeper announcements; further discussion of hurricanes, child pornography arrests, Gary Glitter, Tiger Woods’ fiancée, and various other offensive comments.


The next segment heavily featured the Michael Jackson child molestation allegations, satirizing the Jackson family's defense and comparing them to the Brady Bunch.  Listener calls criticized the show's "gay promos," and recurring technical audio issues plagued the segment.  Another "Guess What's in My Pants" segment with a female caller from Michigan involved sexually suggestive descriptions and image exchange.  The hosts discussed their move to XM, past news broadcast stunts, political opinions (particularly the upcoming presidential election), and a caller’s story about a friend coming out as gay.  The segment concluded with more technical difficulties, banter between the hosts, a call from a Republican listener, and interaction with Frenchie.


The following excerpt started with a euphemistic reference to an erection, transitioning into a news report about cell phones replacing credit cards.  More audio level issues were addressed, particularly a low-volume female caller who was apparently rubbing a phone on her body.  A call with Andrew Gore, a collector of sideshow and serial killer memorabilia, detailed his graphic collection, including fetal remains and items related to Ted Bundy and Charles Manson.  Opie received a call about a "pickled punk" (preserved fetus) and discussed its return. The hosts examined a wiffle ball bat used in past on-air contests, and discussed online poker,  Grand Theft Auto 5, and a caller who claimed successful casino winnings, which contrasted with the hosts’ skepticism.  Another caller asked about "pickled punks," leading to an explanation.  The show discussed a past Laverne and Shirley segment and potential plagiarism, Scott Muni’s funeral, and the presence of Lady Di and Marion.  Black Earl, a former colleague, called in but the call suffered from technical issues and ended abruptly after a humorous anecdote.  The show briefly discussed Bethany Hamilton.  The "What Did We Learn?" segment featured listener feedback and closing remarks, touching on historical empires, the US, and online television previews, ending with a reference to a past incident involving a church.


The final segment opened with the hosts discussing their low-budget production values in contrast to their XM radio advertisement.  The bulk of the segment comprised listener calls recounting what they learned that day, frequently using vulgar and offensive language.  This included descriptions of “teen man boobs,” “teen bleeding,” and crude genitalia comparisons.  Listeners also commented on Jim Norton's alleged poor poker playing and use of winnings, Bob Kelly's behavior, and other crude jokes.  Norton made dismissive remarks about an Albany show.  The hosts discussed the upcoming "Whip Them Out Wednesday" segment and its lack of promotion.  The segment concluded with conversation about a mysterious staff member, Bruce, and a rambling, sexually suggestive conversation from Jim Norton about his childhood and masturbation, ending with repeated mentions of New York City and an XM Satellite Radio advertisement.

[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  That sounds better, right?  Better in my ears.  Hi!  Day two of the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:07:30]  Want to say hi to everyone that turned on their radios yesterday.  Yes.  That's the cool thing about XM Satellite Radio.  Every single day, our audience grows bit by bit.  It's more listeners, more listeners, more friends by six minutes.  And, oh, it's going to take even more rocket science.  A slow build, a slow climb. 
[00:08:00]  You know, just getting used to this facility is a bit much, I must say.  I must say because...  You know what?  We've got to start.  I know where you're going to go.  We've got to start by just trying to get in the building.  Oh, that's a good one.  That's a toughie.  We thought we had it hard at the last building we were at with Whitey.  Remember that security guard, Whitey?  The guy with the white hair who wouldn't let us up.  Saw us walking through there for three years straight and wouldn't let us up into the studio. 
[00:08:30]  Would you let us up anywhere?  No.  Okay.  But we've got this security guard downstairs that just will not let anyone in.  I don't know what he is.  Yeah, I knocked on the door or I rang the bell.  You have to ring the bell.  The big dopey brass bell on the outside of the building.  And then he comes up and I show him my XM radio ID, Opie.  And he goes, no, you need a building ID.  He calls someone and walks away.  He just walks away.  And he walks away.  The funny thing is he's sleeping somewhere because it takes him 20 minutes just to answer the door. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, you've got to ring the bell for a long time.  And meanwhile, you know, we want to get up here.  Maybe, ha ha, prepare.  Oh, stop.  Prepare for an Opie and Anthony show?  Are you nuts?  Don't be silly.  So Anthony and I got up here.  It took a while.  Yeah.  And then we came into this space age studio.  And we're just sitting here like two monkeys.  Yeah.  We don't know how to turn anything on.  We couldn't turn anything on.  I consider myself pretty savvy when it comes to electronics, Opie, and computer equipment and whatnot. 
[00:09:30]  But if you can't get past things like the passwords, like all the computers were locked out, it said.  No, you're locked out.  All right, I'll try a password that, you know, I know works on other things.  Nope, still locked out.  Couldn't look at anything.  Couldn't pull up a website.  Nothing.  All the latest equipment we have.  Couldn't use it.  And then we couldn't turn on the TVs because then we're like, well, we could show prep by watching a little local news.  Sure, see what's going on in the world, maybe. 
[00:10:00]  I have no idea how these TVs work.  No, couldn't work that either.  Couldn't even turn it.  Well, we turned them on, but there was nothing on it.  So then I'm like, all right, well, what time is it?  There's a clock above Jim Norton's head.  It's set for, I don't know, Berlin time or something.  Someone, we had like Berlin and Baghdad time.  How about the time that's going on here, where we are?  Can I ask why there's an arrow?  There's a piece of paper on one clock with time and an arrow pointing towards the clock. 
[00:10:30]  What else would that be?  Because that's the real time.  Well, what's the other one?  I don't know.  Look at it.  Can't you just block it with something?  Just in case you're looking at that for the time.  Oh, wait, follow the arrow?  Oh, time.  The thing with the hands moving.  Now you know to follow the arrow and look at that clock.  So, you know, it's day two as we try to figure out this place.  At least we don't have TV cameras in here today.  Yeah, I'm glad there are less people in here today because yesterday was a bit much.  For our first show, you know, the excitement level was up. 
[00:11:00]  We wanted to put on a good show for our first show.  We understand it's the first day we're back in two years and stuff.  So, you know, there's a few things to overcome.  One of them shouldn't have been having to do a show with a camera crew.  Inches from our face.  Inches from our face.  I'm already distracted.  I'm sorry.  Ben, Jimmy's all mad at me.  I get Jimmy's breakfast and it didn't come out so good.  I asked for an omelet, an egg white omelet, and it looks like somebody dropped little 
[00:11:30]  Connor Peterson into my stupid little breakfast thing.  Look at this watery disaster.  There's no fork.  What is that?  You know, I saw that exact thing on the sidewalk.  One of the homeless guys puked that up.  I think someone just took a spatula and scooped it up for you.  You know, you could say, oh, it looks like vomit as a joke or something, but that honestly  does look like a styrofoam container full of vomit.  Well, can we have a fork with it at least so I can eat it? 
[00:12:00]  What is this?  And no ketchups?  No.  I mean, I don't need a lot, but how about a fork?  You want some condiments, too.  It's so condiments would be nice.  You need some condiments.  And I also have the same problem with Liza Minnelli's father from Arthur at the door  today.  That sleeping drunkard.  It's like a spit in his face.  And building IDs because of the anal retentability, you can only get between 2 and 2.30 today  and Thursday.  They expect you to go home and come back at 2 o'clock.  Not happening.  I plan on being asleep by 2 o'clock.  We're all on edge as we try to readjust to this morning radio. 
[00:12:30]  One thing, I read a lot of the reviews of the radio show and stuff, and the one thing  people hate already is Ben laughing in the background at everything.  Ben cackling, cackling Ben.  Well, if you shut off this mic once in a while, it wouldn't be a problem.  I don't know how to.  Are you kidding me?  Look at this board.  We don't know anything yet.  No, it's still getting used to this.  We probably should have done a couple practice shows.  You know, that might have been a good idea if they had a little lead time, Opie, on building  our studio. 
[00:13:00]  But they didn't know we were going to broadcast from here until four months ago.  Right.  So, you know, it really wasn't enough lead time to build the studio.  They knew in June, pretty much, that we were going to be broadcasting from this facility.  And they started work on it when?  Wednesday.  Really?  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Perhaps we could have gotten in here a little sooner.  I understand Frank's Place was broadcasting out of here. 
[00:13:30]  Perhaps they couldn't interrupt the energy level that was going on in the studio during  Frank's Place.  All the dames that were coming and going.  The broads, baby.  We had broads and dames in here.  How can we do work with nice tender pins walking back and forth?  Baby.  Yeah, so maybe that was the reason the studio wasn't worked on.  So we decided to just throw ourselves out there and go, well, we'll make do with what  we got so far.  Sure.  People are pissed off that we only had one sound effect yesterday. 
[00:14:00]  Got a few more today.  We do have a few more.  I wouldn't worry about it.  All right.  Also, Ben saw, what, people effing on the way in today?  Yeah, it was 4 o'clock in the morning, you know.  I live downtown, so it's not a big surprise yet.  Walked by a steamy SUV with 50-cent plane, a guy banging a chick in the back seat.  Yeah, you live in like a pretty partying part of Manhattan.  Yeah, I lived downtown.  Yeah, and then the crackhead in the diner picking up his hot chocolate, which he tried 
[00:14:30]  to run out on, two bucks.  It's great.  I love coming to work at this time.  New York City is a very strange place that early in the morning.  It's when we come in, because I think I come in now at about midnight.  I don't even know what time it is.  It's much too early to even come in and prepare for the show.  And, you know, during the day, Manhattan is pinnacle of the free world.  But at that hour, it is the sleaziest place.  There's people that might as well be dead laying on the sidewalk. 
[00:15:00]  There are homeless guys just laying down.  They find a subway great and go to sleep.  People screwing in their vehicles after a night of partying.  Crackheads in the deli.  You go in and try to get a bottle of water or something like that.  You're in fear for your life.  You know, there's a guy in there.  Give me a hot chocolate with some whipped cream.  No more whipped cream.  What's the matter with you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  And then he grabs it and, what, he tried bolting out on it, Ben? 
[00:15:30]  The guy's bolting out on, what, a $1.50 cup of hot chocolate.  It gets even better because he kept looking at himself in the mirror.  And the poor guy behind the deli.  Yeah, because he thought it was someone else all paranoid on crack.  That guy look like me.  And he's like, put some more whipped cream.  Put some more whipped cream.  And he takes the whipped cream and starts pouring in his mouth.  I was like, oh.  Oh, that's good.  That's classic.  That's wonderful.  And then you've got the puke cleanup crew.  You notice that on the sidewalk?  Oh, with the hoses and the bleach.  All the restaurant guys just hosing down the front of their establishments.  Yeah, anyone with a business in New York has to go out at that hour 
[00:16:00]  and hose down the night's horror show that has been just upchucked all over the sidewalk.  And the garbage that's put out from the restaurants and the rats that are eating it.  So everything smells like either bleach or vomit or a little bit of both.  And that's what you get.  That's now our eye-opener in the morning.  Mmm, mmm.  Used to be coming in, you know, it was afternoon, so you'd get hot chicks in their smart business suits going to work. 
[00:16:30]  Hot chicks shopping.  You know, maybe the businessmen going to that business lunch.  But now, I mean, we're looking, I'm going to be manic-depressed after doing this for a week,  just looking at the horrors of our society walking the streets of New York City and laying in their own vomit and feces.  I absolutely love it.  This is all ride-around time for me.  I'm always up at this hour.  You are, yeah, because you're a comic. 
[00:17:00]  So you're doing your gigs, and then after you're done, you find yourself a hooker.  I'm always riding around, just pinching the shaft, looking for somebody.  Believe me.  You know how many hours I've spent riding around at this time?  Where are the hookers?  You know something?  I might sound naive, but I'm usually not up at that hour.  I don't even know where hookers are in New York City.  Usually in the 40s you can get them, but they're in cars, so you have to kind of be aware of that.  Hookers in cars.  No, that's the new thing.  For years they've been doing that.  Yeah, really.  It's genius, actually, because it's harder for the cops to get them if they're riding around.  In my neighborhood, they put their business cards on all the cars. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, I didn't have a business card.  Oh, they put business cards.  You're looking for a date, you call, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, like Vegas.  And when you go to Vegas, they hand you these little business cards.  Really?  But it's on your windshield, and you call the number, and I guess what?  They drive up, and you do your action in the limo or something.  I can honestly say I've never paid for sex in my life.  I swear.  I never have.  Anytime you have to hear a woman talk after it, you've paid for sex.  Very good.  Awesome, man.  I don't know.  I'm so paranoid, too, you know? 
[00:18:00]  I don't know how you do it.  Like, I would be scared of getting busted.  I watch too many episodes of Cops.  I love the show.  And when they, you know, the guy is coming into the hotel room, and the cops are waiting  in the bathroom to come running out and throw him against the wall and make fun of him,  it's frightening.  Because he goes into the hotel room.  I never do that.  I either go on Craigslist, and I have them come to me, or I pick them.  I never go into a hotel room like that.  No?  No, rookie mistake.  Really?  For a bust.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  In the car?  You get in there, and where do you go? 
[00:18:30]  Where do you park?  You will find a night dark.  Oh, you take them back to your place?  When I can.  I live right there, so I'll just go, hey, it's a little bit safer to go to my place.  No, I'd be afraid that, you know, her pimps were going to come back and just roll  my apartment.  Now I have a doorman building.  I mean, it's a little bit harder to get up, and there's nothing to my, what are you going  to take in my apartment?  My signed Sabbath picture?  Your duvet?  Exactly, yeah.  Which has candle wax, which looks like other stuff all over it.  Awful.  Does the doorman know what you're up to?  Yeah, you know, his name is Teddy, and he's like a little Asian guy. 
[00:19:00]  Look at Jim.  What does the doorman think?  He's picking up chicks every night?  Oh, Jim.  Yeah, he's a little creepy weirdo.  He must have some line.  Yeah, how much?  Yeah, I bring a lot of them over, and, you know, the guys kind of know that I always  have massage girls and stuff coming over.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a filth bag.  You really are.  Dirty little boy.  God, I'd be so paranoid, though.  Can we talk about that as I hold this up?  The fact that there was a prostitute that lived down in the same hall as me?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  She lived like five doors down in my building, and, yeah, she would come over. 
[00:19:30]  That's handy.  Oh, it was fantastic.  It really was.  And she would just come over for $150, you know, full service.  It was everything.  $150.  Yeah, she wanted $400.  This is how I caught her, because I kind of suspected, because she was really hot, and  she was talking to me, and I'm like, she's got to be a prostitute.  So she gives me her number, and I Google it, and I see her under an escort head.  Oh, look how smart you are.  Yeah.  And I call her, and I'm like, so, how you doing?  And she's like, all right, baby, it's $400 for the hour.  It's $200 if you want just head, blah, blah, blah, whatever she said. 
[00:20:00]  And I'm like, oh, this is Jim from down the hall.  And she goes, oh, looks like I'm busted.  You know, silly goose.  She gave you a discount, though?  I live in the same hallway discount.  Oh, dude, it was great.  She'd come over drunk $150 for everything.  Probably the end of the night, she could just, you know, it's either, well, I'll go to bed  and not make any money, or I could get $150 from Jimmy.  I'd rather not look at it like end of the night, although you're probably right.  But I was wondering, when I put it in, like, white stuff would come out of the corner 
[00:20:30]  of her mouth.  It was awful.  Oh, that's horrible.  It was like a tube of toothpaste when you're rolling.  Yeah, you're right, though.  God, I never thought of it that way, but thanks for bringing that home.  Yeah, you're the last one of the night.  I should have worn a bag.  Hindsight is 20-20, folks.  Live and learn.  So is your T-cell count, 20.  Oh, that's classic.  Oh, I forgot about that.  She left.  She actually left the building.  She still calls me.  She still calls me, but I won't see her anymore, because I think it's, I know I feel it's stupid, 
[00:21:00]  but she drinks so much, and it's like, eh, I feel bad contributing.  You don't like them being that drunk?  No, I feel, I know she's a mess, and when I know somebody's a mess, I can't contribute  to their downfall like that.  Like, I like to have the illusion that they're putting themselves through school at age 40.  Yeah, you're doing them a service.  Yeah, I'll help you out with your books.  Whatever gets you through it, Jimmy.  Yeah, it's fucking.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  So you were pretty tired on Tough Crowd last night, huh?  Oh, what an ass I was.  Oh, my God.  I caught the tail end of Tough Crowd, because it was my, um, the third time I woke up during 
[00:21:30]  the night.  I'd like to say something to my friends and family and whatnot.  Could you not call me ever anymore?  Especially during the time we're trying to get acclimated to this, uh, this sleep schedule,  which is ridiculous.  I've never, ever held these hours in my life.  And, uh, I get home after almost falling asleep on the way home.  And I'm not kidding.  I wasn't like, oh, I was so tired.  I almost fell asleep.  Literally.  I was really having a problem staying awake for the drive, uh, home. 
[00:22:00]  10.30 in the morning.  10.30 in the morning, and I'm falling asleep as my, you know, 18-ton vehicle is just barreling  down the Long Island Expressway.  You know, there's my, uh, navigation system talking to me.  Make a left at this exit.  Huh?  What?  What did she say?  And I have no idea.  I'm waiting.  She was keeping me awake.  That probably saved her life.  Yeah.  Wake up, idiot.  You're falling asleep.  And I was.  I was falling asleep. 
[00:22:30]  Finally get home and just crap right out.  And there's my phone ringing.  Hey, good show, man.  No, thank you.  Could you not ever call me again?  Had to turn the phone off.  Missed a couple of messages from Opie.  Yep.  And, uh, don't call.  Very, very hard time I'm having getting, uh, accustomed to this schedule.  But you saw Jim on, uh, Tough Crowd?  Yeah, so I woke up.  My third time up was, like, around midnight.  I just about caught the end of Tough Crowd.  And you were just a babbling idiot. 
[00:23:00]  I thought you were Colin for a second, the way you were a stuttering, mumbling buffoon.  Oh, boy, was that dummy happy.  I tripped on, like, two good ones, and I mean, really fell on my dumb face.  I heard at the end of the show now, Colin does his little, uh, little talking.  Press conference.  At the end of his press conference, right, at the end of the show.  And, uh, they were just ragging on you, and how you were mumbling and stuttering through  your jokes, and you screwed it up, and he just took such pleasure in ripping you apart.  He was, and he even told the audience, like, while we were on a break how happy he was,  and I had to get up now at, like, five o'clock in the morning, and I was just tripping. 
[00:23:30]  And he, there was one joke, it was about the Hiltons, like, because, you know, Paris Hiltons,  uh, is doing another porn video.  So we were talking about one of the topics we talked about was her new porn that's coming  out with two guys.  And the joke was supposed to be...  Two guys.  Yeah, which should be okay.  All right, we're gonna have to...  On the rotisserie?  We're gonna have to talk about this.  I don't know, to be honest with you, I haven't seen it yet, um, but I imagine, I mean, unless  it's...  I love a porno with a chick on the rotisserie, man.  It really is just completely humiliating.  Right on the spit.  Yeah.  Right on the spit like a suckling pig.  Don't you love it?  Here's a little special barbecue sauce, honey. 
[00:24:00]  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ouch!  Ooh!  Ouch!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Very hot.  Paris Hilton?  Yeah.  Oh, without a doubt, yeah.  Because some guys think she's too skinny.  No, she's great.  Yeah.  She's fantastic.  Too skinny.  Yeah, that is pretty good.  And she's doing another porno.  That's exactly what she should be doing.  That's exactly what she has to contribute.  What can I do?  Lay on your back.  Relax.  There you go.  Open those.  Good girl.  And she also said the N-word.  Did she really?  Yeah, that's the big story in the paper today. 
[00:24:30]  Nicole?  Is it?  Paris.  No, I mean, what was the N-word that she said?  I was making a little Nicole Richie joke.  Maybe it's all that cold medication got you down.  You see this mess over here?  I faked it pretty good yesterday, but I'm done today.  Yeah.  I hope he's got a Dwayne Reed in front of him.  Oh, it's revolting.  Halls, a little yogurt, some chloroceptic.  What is that?  Dayquil?  I got Dayquil.  Lip balm.  Lip balm because you get dehydrated from freaking sneezing so much.  A lot of liquid in your snot. 
[00:25:00]  I got the Visine for the red eyes.  I got the Tylenol for the freaking fever.  I got the Dayquil that I was on all day yesterday.  I got the, yeah, the halls for the throat, the chloroceptic.  You were the one who gave me this crap.  The chloroceptic?  I was saying don't do the chloroceptic because it gives you, like, trench mouth.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  But it helps to tickle in the back of the throat.  Ah.  And then another roll of toilet paper, which will be gone by 10 o'clock this morning.  All you're missing from that little collection is tampons and AZT. 
[00:25:30]  I know.  It's so pathetic.  It really is nauseating.  I really can't defend that at all.  This is one of the worst colds going around because I had it last week.  When we were doing the promotional tour, Anthony was sick.  And I was thinking to myself, oh, God, if he's sick.  Because Anthony never gets sick.  It's coming my way.  I know it.  And sure enough, you know, the worst timing ever.  We start the third stage of the Opie and Anthony show, and I am so out of it.  It's not even funny.  Ill-fated.  I know where I caught it from, too. 
[00:26:00]  At Mohegan Sun handling those disgusting chips from those old people there.  Oh.  Those disgusting old sniffling.  Ugh.  And they're holding the chips.  And, of course, it's going from one person to another, you know.  One person loses 20 bucks.  You won 20 bucks?  The dealer doesn't put it back in their stack.  They give you the old, snotty chips from the person next to you, and then you got them  in front of you.  I never thought of that.  It's disgusting. 
[00:26:30]  It's not going to stop me from gambling.  No.  It's wonderful.  Never, ever.  But I'm sure that's where I got it.  And I had a fever about a week ago.  I had a fever that, and I never get fevers, man.  And I wound up getting fever junk.  You know what fever junk is?  Yes, I do.  It's when your body is hot.  I had a fever.  It was over 101.  It isn't that bad, but it's a fever.  Your body tries to regulate the temperature.  And if you know anything about the reproductive system, your testicles hang out of your body 
[00:27:00]  because the temperature has to be less than body temperature to make your sperm cells.  Is that why they hang outside?  Yes.  I didn't realize.  I thought that was just to humiliate a girl when you put them on her nose.  All right, so you learn something every day.  My apologies.  I believe they have to be somewhere around 96 degrees to produce sperm cells.  I've had the fever junk for the last two days.  So when you have a fever, your sack is so low, man. 
[00:27:30]  They're like click clacks.  It's like you take two click clacks.  Remember that old kid's toy?  The click clacks.  Now take it and get a fruit roll-up.  Put it in the microwave for three minutes.  Now stick the click clacks in the fruit roll-up and hang it between your legs.  That's pretty much what my sack was like.  Sticking to my thigh.  And then your junk itself, you know, your schlong kind of hangs down too.  It looks very impressive when you go into the bathroom and look in the full-length mirror. 
[00:28:00]  You're like, wow, you got porn star junk.  But it gets annoying when you roll over in bed and your sack is touching your ass.  How did that happen?  It's fever junk.  It's all hot and bothered and trying to get away from your body.  Eventually we're going to have to do what we learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  Fever junk.  Fever junk.  Hefty stuff's still not set up.  We don't know how to print out feedback yet.  We got an FU line that still doesn't work. 
[00:28:30]  So it's a work in progress.  It's a work in progress.  Like we said, they didn't have enough time, four months, to get our studio in order.  And Ben and Steve are going to probably brawl by Friday, I think.  Oh, these two?  Yeah.  That's a match made in heaven, man.  Steve could kick my ass.  I'm not even going to, you know, try and fight him.  Did you even have to say that?  Yeah.  It's like, hey, by the way, guys, Steve could kick my ass in case you didn't know.  I don't know if Steve has a listening problem or is he just deaf. 
[00:29:00]  No, I am partially deaf.  So that's definitely.  I don't like that Steve could just talk from another room.  Martini Steve.  See, we have another sound clip today.  Nice.  I love it.  It's a great addition to the show, the Martini Steve music.  We're coming back.  See?  That's wonderful.  Thank you so much.  No problem, Steve.  Steve's dressed very appropriately for work today. 
[00:29:30]  Tattoos and a.  Who the fuck am I trying to impress?  Wait, we can't hear you.  Yes.  Your audio is low, sweetie.  Is it really?  Yeah, I'll say.  It's real low.  Really?  Yeah.  That's odd.  How's that?  Oh, there we go.  Take those thick Lebanese fingers and turn the.  So, Ben, how is Steve supposed to dress?  Oh, I don't know.  Ben, who am I trying to impress at 6 o'clock in the goddamn morning?  Ben looks a little nice.  He's got his shirt, his collared button-down shirt on. 
[00:30:00]  It's orange.  Yeah.  So?  And you have the cut-off sleeve skull and crossbones.  I'll just tell you a little story.  The other day, me, Oak, and Steve went to lunch after we were here during the day,  and we went to a restaurant over here in Midtown, and they did not want to seat Steve.  They were mortified.  They tried to put us in a corner, and Steve was wearing that exact same shirt, and his  sleep's cut off.  At a nice restaurant, right?  Exactly.  So I put a jacket on.  Whatever.  It was fine.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:30:30]  What?  Yeah, these two are going to kill each other.  Oh, yeah.  And it won't be long.  I like Ben.  It's just, you know, he's such an instigator sometimes.  He knows he's doing it, too.  He is an expert in prodding and poking.  He figures out what your buttons are, and then he just goes right for them, and he just doesn't  stop until he gets blasted.  You know what Club Soda Kenny said?  What?  Club Soda Kenny loves pulling gags on people all the time, on Perfect Strangers.  You know, he'll be, excuse me, you dropped something, and then the person looks around  like they dropped something, or just go, miss, and then not look at the person. 
[00:31:00]  The person thinks you were calling them.  Those fun little gags.  He can't do it in front of Ben.  He said to me, he goes, I can't do it.  I said, why?  Because Ben will go right up to the person's face, point at them, and start laughing hysterically  at the person.  You're going to get killed someday.  Kenny's too funny, though.  We were in Boston on Newberry Street, and the Yankees were in town, and he's screaming,  look, it's the fucking New York Yankees!  Out in the middle of the street, people were just mortified.  That was one of the funny ones. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, they love him in Boston.  All right, I'd like to go to the phones, but that's today's problem, yeah.  The phones?  Yeah, I can't click on phone calls.  Are you on the proper screen?  Oh.  No?  Uh-oh.  At least you can't throw this one through the wall.  It's just a monitor.  I know.  All right, we'll have to work on that problem.  Why don't we take our first break?  Do we have any sponsors yet?  I don't know.  Day two, no sponsors?  Steve, no sponsors yet?  Do you know what a party it's going to be when we get our first sponsor? 
[00:32:00]  Do you understand the attention we are going to give the first sponsor?  Can they even grasp how we are going to sell their product, whatever it is?  I thought that guy wanted to sponsor the rape brick yesterday.  What about Schwanz cream?  Stuff that makes your junk grow without a fever.  Ooh.  You know?  Where did they go?  Where's the false pills that grow hair on your head?  Or something.  Where's the stuff that makes your man goo taste like fruit flavors? 
[00:32:30]  Where are all those fun products?  Just think.  If the first sponsor on this show will get such attention.  A lot of attention.  Stuff will be flying off the shelves.  If it's even sold in stores.  Usually it's over the internet, isn't it?  Usually it's illegal stuff.  It's illegal.  Available from Canada.  There was a time that I had pointed out to the WNAW staff that we had advertisements for an escort service.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  They had no idea. 
[00:33:00]  Didn't they pull that after like one day?  Yeah.  After we told them.  Hookers.  We were advertising for hookers on our show.  Only the best for the Opie and Anthony show.  Only the best.  Remind me to tell you the story of when I was in Dallas and I got in trouble with one of the Pugs and Kelly whorehouse sponsors.  Oh, they sponsored a whorehouse?  Well, whorehouse is one of our advertisements, yeah.  Ran ads.  I don't know why I said remind me to tell you instead of just telling you like it's a big teaser.  Don't get out of the car, folks.  What a fucking dullard.  Forget it.  Just move on.  I'm sorry.  Yes, you are. 
[00:33:30]  A little radio tease.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break here.  I don't know what they play during the commercials.  Yeah.  Well, it's not commercials.  I think they just play comedians and stuff.  Hang in there, folks.  On the way, Club Soda Kenny's checking in.  Also, I think we got the wiffle ball bat today.  Oh, if we could get a girl to, well, if we could get a girl.  It would be nice just to stop right there.  It would be nice just to get a girl in the studio.  To break in the new studio.  That would be very, very nice.  Yeah.  One girl showed up with the inappropriate bells yesterday, but she was too scared to 
[00:34:00]  come in here.  I didn't even see her.  No, she was too scared.  I know.  I saw her.  Where are the bells?  I need at least one.  Oh, there's one.  Okay.  All right.  So we got that.  Also, Anthony, we're going to bring one of our bits back today.  Which one, Opie?  That was taken away from us.  It was taken away before we even got fired.  Yeah.  I remember this well before we got fired.  We were having such a good time with it.  And, of course, we were having much too much fun.  Our listeners were enjoying it much too much, so management had to take it away. 
[00:34:30]  Of course.  And that is What's in My Pants.  I love What's in My Pants.  Looking for the ladies to call to play What's in My Pants this morning.  Okay?  And when we come back, our first review of our new radio show.  Yes.  In the newspaper today, in the Daily News.  In the Daily News, David Hinkley wrote about the opiate Anthony return.  XM rated is the headline.  Oh, ho, ho.  Kind of like X with an M.  So we'll get into that next.  Ow!  Shut your mouth! 
[00:35:00]  I said shut your fucking mouth!  I masturbated so hard, I almost broke my vagina.  The opiate Anthony show.  Here's another bunch of genetic defectives who've been turned loose on answering machines.  These guys who cannot resist the urge to put music on their outgoing messages.  You know, some guy spends eight dollars at Radio Shack and suddenly he's a fucking record producer. 
[00:35:30]  And because he's busy in the basement jacking off his dog, I, I have to listen to substandard music.  And it's always rotten music, you know?  It's either new age, that pointless, meandering zombie noise played by pseudo-spiritual lunatics  who think wind chimes are a musical instrument.  Or else it's soft rock, soft rock, that lame-ass, weak, non-threatening, suburban white boy junk  played by bands like Men Without Testicles. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, and folks, on these answering machines, do me a favor, would you please?  When you record your outgoing message, don't bother telling me you can't come to the phone.  I understand that.  Apparently that's why we have these machines.  And don't tell me to leave my name and number.  Somehow, I figured that out.  And if you work in an office, never mind that stuff, I'm away from my desk.  If you had to take a shit, say so. 
[00:36:30]  Just say, hi, this is Mary Louise.  I had the Mexican jalapeno bean chili dip.  And I washed it down with a gallon of gin.  I'll be in and out all day.  There are some more people who ought to be strapped into chairs and beaten with hammers.  People who wear visors. 
[00:37:00]  Let me ask you something.  What the fuck is the point in wearing half a hat?  Either get a hat or don't.  No one's interested in the top of your head.  Go back to the store and tell them to give you the rest of the hat.  They cheated you.  Better still, get yourself one of them little Jewish hats and sew it to your visor.  Then you got yourself a full-fledged fucking hat, my friend. 
[00:37:30]  Here are some more musical vermin whose mothers we wish had had medical plans that included abortion.  These singers.  These singers who think they're so special, they only need one name.  Bono, Sting, Jewel, Tiffany, Prince.  What a crock of shit.  Get a fucking last name, would you please?  I got a nice two-word name for you.  Pretentious Cocksucker. 
[00:38:00]  How do you like that?  Bono, Sting.  It's not bad enough the music sucks, but with no last name you can't find out where they live to throw a fucking bomb through their window.  It's frustrating.  Here are some more people who deserve an inoperable tumor at the base of their spines.  These guys who fly around the world in a fucking balloon.  What is this, 1850? 
[00:38:30]  Get a fucking airline ticket, will you please?  When are the media going to realize no one's interested in some rich trouser stain who's so bored he's got to fly around the balloon all day?  I hope the next guy gets hit by lightning, which flies around in a little fart circle.  And lands in a sewage treatment pond. 
[00:39:00]  And sinks with the rest of the turds.  Mr. Lighter Than Air.  Mr. Lighter Than Air. 
[00:39:30]  All right, I got to choke down a banana and one quarter of an onion bagel.  I kind of miss those 20-minute commercial breaks.  Where we could...  That you get on regular radio.  Drink two full beers and play a game of foosball.  Yeah, you could go in the back office and F a whore.  And then come back and continue with the show.  Now it's like, I just need to dump. 
[00:40:00]  I want to dump.  I need to dump.  I hope he was filling us in on his dump schedule earlier and said that you hadn't in how long?  I'm up to two and a half days.  Really?  I think it gets toxic.  Third day.  Wow.  That's packing.  You know what?  That's going to leave a dent coming out.  I don't care.  I just need to blow it out.  It's going to hurt.  It's going to be dark, like really dark, like you're filled with blood, sick log.  So if I run out of the studio, I'm going to have to, you know, just because I have to 
[00:40:30]  take care of this.  Really?  Why don't you just find a Sinatra album to take a shit on?  I hear that guy's really happy with our presence.  The Sinatra guy apparently hates our guts.  How do you know that?  I don't know.  The word around town is he's not too happy with us.  Word around town.  Word on the street.  Yeah.  Oh, everyone's been just so nice here so far.  I haven't experienced it.  I'm just speculating.  I hear he doesn't like us.  Let's give it time.  All right.  I think we got the instant feedback working, Ant.  Yeah.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station says, Ant never paid for sex. 
[00:41:00]  What about the $15 million you paid to that fat F. Dominic Barbara for the three-way?  Ow.  Fast Freddy.  Ow.  And Phil from New Orleans saying, New York City at 4 a.m.  Sounds like watching Disney workers after a ride disaster.  Just hose it off and start again.  Nice.  All right.  Let's say hi to Club Soda Kenny.  I think we got the phones working.  Kenny.  Good morning, sunshine.  Hi, Kenny.  How are you, sir? 
[00:41:30]  How's everybody doing there?  We're doing okay, Kenny.  Very good.  Let me tell you, it's so exciting that you guys are back.  Well, thank you, Kenny.  We're very excited to be back.  And I don't want to get off the topic, but just a word of advice for Opie.  If you're a little constipated, you've got to stick a finger in there and loosen things up.  Oh, jeez.  He's right, actually.  No.  What do we have, an intern?  Have him do it.  Yeah, you loosen things up a little bit. 
[00:42:00]  Get things going.  Thanks, Kenny, for that.  But listen.  Over-the-counter stuff.  You need some Metamucil.  I just need to go, man.  Cute little Anthony.  Thank you.  Kenny, when are you coming in?  I don't know.  I'm talking to you now on the phone.  I know, but I like to see you when I'm talking to you.  Well, what are you doing Friday night?  Albany, the Palace Theater.  Funny you should ask, Ken.  Oh, wow.  That really has to stop.  Plug whore.  Kenny asked me.  I answered. 
[00:42:30]  I'm friends.  The plug whore.  Well, Kenny, what do you got today?  Well, I just wanted to welcome you guys back.  And, you know, you can't even buy a radio in the store because you guys, all the radios  have sold out.  Yeah, we got to say hi to everyone that got their XM satellite radios turned on yesterday.  Every day, our audience builds slowly but surely.  We have to say hi every day to people?  Yeah, because they're that it.  Why not?  They're here in the first show.  Yeah, but you got to get those Delphi people to make some more radios.  Yeah.  They obviously move slow in that country. 
[00:43:00]  What country is that?  What country do they make them in?  Delphi.  Delphi's a country?  Well, isn't it?  They make the radios.  They're those people.  What is it, Delphi?  Is that a satellite radio?  I wouldn't know.  Oh, I've heard of them.  Oh, why wouldn't you know, Jimmy?  Who knows?  Because apparently, you know, UPS must have lost that package again.  I had to go down to Bob Kelly's apartment, who's becoming like a girlfriend, and I ate  and listened to the show yesterday, while Bob sat there shirtless, looking like Dr. Evil,  that shaved, awful, bald head of his. 
[00:43:30]  That creepy oddball.  Jimmy doesn't have a radio yet.  I don't have one.  What's the problem?  I wouldn't know.  They took my address.  They're like, what's your address?  I gave it to them.  Figured my XM would be waiting for me as soon as I got home.  No XM.  You know what happened to me?  What happened?  I have a boombox unit with the little Delphi.  The Delphi, right.  And I got it home.  I've had it for a while.  I activated it.  Activated the channel 202 for $1.99 a month extra. 
[00:44:00]  First month free.  But, you know something?  Because I am an employee, I got it for free.  I got it for free.  And I was feeling pretty good about that.  You know, they treat their employees nice.  I got it for free.  Opie, right before showtime yesterday, my girlfriend goes to turn the radio on.  And I have nothing.  It's as if I was never subscribed to it or anything.  And went through this whole long thing of getting it turned on for the past week.  Just trying to get it for free. 
[00:44:30]  You know what I finally did?  Went out.  Bought another boombox.  Bought a unit.  Got on the phone.  Didn't say who I was.  Signed up with a credit card.  Now it works just fine.  Perfect.  And I'm paying for it.  I have to pay to listen to the show.  Jimmy.  That's what XM does.  You're going to have to just bite the bullet and buy your own stuff.  I had to do the same thing.  Right.  You had to buy one too?  Yeah, I tried to work it out and it didn't work out the way I want it to work out. 
[00:45:00]  Now that shows me something.  XM, very smart.  Yeah.  Very smart about the money coming into the company.  They don't want to give away anything for free.  They're like, all right, these narcissistic jizz bags definitely want to listen to themselves.  So just hold out a little while.  Hey, did you guys talk about all those appearances you had?  Those appearances were off the hook, yo.  Yeah, we had fun.  They were terrific.  I told Norton this story, but I didn't get a chance to tell you about the chick I picked up in Long Island the other night. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, right, right, right.  Yes.  You picked up a chick?  Yeah, it's a cute story.  You're really going to love it.  Okay.  She was a little older than me.  She was about 50 years old.  So we go back to her place.  It's not a chick anymore.  I start fooling around with her and we're like making out.  And she told me she had like a fetish about her breasts or something.  And she wanted me to like play around with her breasts.  So I'm like making out with her and I started to like suck on her stupid tits and fluid is coming out.  And I'm like, I don't know. 
[00:46:00]  And she's a little old to have like no breasts.  Is she lactating?  So I'm like making out with her and she wants me to like play around with her tits.  So I'm sucking on her stupid tits and like fluid is coming out.  And I'm thinking to myself, she's got to be too old to have like milk in her tits.  So I finally, I couldn't take it anymore.  So I asked her, I go, you know, aren't you too old to have like milk coming out of your breast?  And she goes, yeah, but I'm not too old to have breast cancer.  Oh, my. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That made me happy.  My first apology.  I'm sorry to anybody who had to hear that.  I was sorry, too.  That is not right.  Thank you, Kenny.  I couldn't help it.  Do you have anything else today?  Did you have a poem or something you wanted to do?  Well, I got a musical tribute to welcome you back, but that's like the grand finale. 
[00:47:00]  I'm building up to it.  Oh, no, I think it's time for the grand finale.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think I think it is.  No, one more thing.  I got to just discuss with you.  Yeah.  On Norton's blog spot.  Did you know he paid me a big compliment?  Did I?  What did I say?  You wanted to rate my face in Boston.  Oh, did I say that?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  No, I really, that's special.  You don't say that to too many people.  No, it was something about, yeah, Ken's mustache and, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, like he went to that strip club and it didn't work out because there was like the  two-foot rule.  Oh, wow, yeah.  So he was thinking of raping my face, but, you know, you didn't knock on my door.  Yeah, we went to a strip club that has a two-foot rule.  You can't, you know, Boston is just screwy.  There's some real screwy things going on, and I guess it's all in Massachusetts.  They make up these ridiculous laws.  You could go to a strip club.  You could drink in the strip club.  You could see completely nude girls as you drink in the strip club. 
[00:48:00]  Sounds pretty good.  There's a two-foot rule that is strictly enforced.  You cannot get within two feet of the girls.  What is that going to do?  Like, how did they make that law up?  You want to sit there.  If you want to get a lap dance, you want the girl to be on your lap.  You want her to be, you know, moving and grooving in your lap, kind of brushing against your  junk with her thigh and ass and stuff.  But there's a two-foot rule.  It wastes.  I was watching people get lap dances going. 
[00:48:30]  That is a complete waste of time.  It's not even a lap dance.  It's more of a vicinity dance.  You just kind of sit there.  That would have been funny if I said vicinity and that rotten stroke voice.  But they needed a two-foot rule because that's the size of Norton's mule.  My mule is thick.  Nice.  I mean, it's not quite Anthony's fever junk, which is hanging in smells of onions.  But, you know, even if your junk is huge, it could only get within two feet.  I don't like any lap dance where I have to get up to punch her in the face if it's not good. 
[00:49:00]  That's a little rule.  Violence against woman humor right away.  Awful.  All right, Kenny, the grand finale.  Okay, you ready?  I don't know.  I guess.  Welcome back.  Your dreams were your ticket out.  Welcome back to the same old place that you laughed about.  Well, your names have all changed since you hung around.  But those dreams have remained and they've turned around. 
[00:49:30]  Who'd have thought they'd lead you?  Who'd have thought they'd lead you?  Right here where they need you?  Right here where they need you?  Right here where they need you?  Well, they tease you all off because you got them on the spot.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  I'm going back.  I'm a police officer.  Nice. 
[00:50:00]  Or, you know, we could do Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  club soda kenny everyone thank you uh phil from boston went to best buy last night to get another  xm home kit and they were completely sold out of the 40 roadies and home kits now after yesterday's  horrendous show i know it can't be because of you guys welcome back ah thank you all right  still no girls calling anthony we want to do what's in uh oh right guess what's in my pants

[00:52:30]  it if radio never changed he's an old school stuff he's pretty uh pretty old so he kind of likes the  older stuff you know where they just play the same music over and over again and you know talk about  the music yeah those were the golden years of radio he likes writing you know around labor day  who's doing the firecracker 500 or something like that that's like his cup of tea yeah uh we're not  his cup of tea but with that said he uh he didn't blast us too bad in this hmm the headline is opian  anthony return xm rated naughty boys opian anthony resurfaced naughty are we naughty you are fresh as paint 
[00:53:00]  that word annoys me hold on a minute it's chip a girl's name ah look at the commercial on tv for the  station we used to work at oh they have a hundred thousand dollars to give away and ru paul oh  speaking of what's in my pants ru paul the new morning host over there i played that game with  a few ru paul esks young ladies they only lost millions upon millions of dollars after they 
[00:53:30]  canceled our radio show over there because they had because they had such a better idea with yes with  this blink crap dude it was so intriguing they painted everything pink you just had to know what  it was about we got to explain this to the rest of the country we get canceled we were kicking ass  here in new york and many other cities they get rid of us and they come up with this concept called  blink 1027 or something like that had a pink logo and it's supposed to be uh a channel dedicated to  women i guess dedicated to women the logo looked like a tampon box no joke i'm i'm being serious it 
[00:54:00]  looked like a tampon box it said blink on it and then they did like entertainment features and gossip  features but yeah when they were gossiping they weren't really gossiping because because it all  had to be nice nice and pc and it was like a cross between lifetime and the e channel that's pretty  much what they were going it was a complete disaster and john sykes continues to work for the company  yeah that was his brilliant idea the view after he decided to not stick up for us and then go into 
[00:54:30]  his office like a little coward yeah that have the lawyers fire us over the phone yeah that's what  you want from your executive a guy that that uh runs away when the going gets tough but they lost  millions and millions of dollars on that disaster ouch anyway uh chip chip what's up not much man what's  going on oh see he wants to play what's in my pants we really need a girl to call need a girl  to uh break in our our old feature that's going to be new again what's in my pants uh 866 wow one wow 
[00:55:00]  all right so david hinkley in the daily news opian anthony return xm rated naughty boys opian anthony  resurfaced yesterday this time in the no rules world of satellite radio no rule and they likely  and they likely astonished some critics by not immediately turning the airwaves blue  anthony and i you and i were under control yesterday for the debut of this new show we  didn't really curse everyone else completely out of control ben let the f word fly a million times 
[00:55:30]  and pretty quickly frenchy let the c word fly a million times yesterday i know i wanted uh the  fcc to step in and regulate frenchy yesterday that's how bad it was and the caller is completely  out of control yesterday mother effer you f and c i don't think we've had a one caller that hasn't  cursed yet oh they're so excited about cursing they just i i know kenny didn't curse did he  yes what did he say current tits is that but that's you can say that on comedy central that's  not that bad considering the freedom just to say tits that's not bad you can't say tits on uh 
[00:56:00]  comedy central radio quite frankly giving up on any kind of regulation oh no they haven't them and fx  try writing an act four for tough crowd and get it through without standards trapping on it oh  really rough yeah because they were playing like chris rock on unedited and and south park i mean  they use the c word on south park in society you can only uh you can only curse if you're a cartoon  i mean that's is that the rule well as an official ruling as a country yeah we're a dumb country 
[00:56:30]  yeah if you're a cartoon you can get away with murder you know it's not a real person  the cartoon draws itself all right so uh we astonished some critics by not immediately turning  the airwaves blue yesterday yeah today but the hot talk host tell us how old he is right there  oh working blue hell is it the 30s but the hot talk host off the air since they were kicked to the  curb by any w in august 2002 for saying that two of their listeners were having sex in the same  past cathedral were not reluctant to flex the freedom they now have on xm satellite radio four 
[00:57:00]  letter uh uh curses some of these words are tough to say what it called uh float freely and  recorded bits and calls from listeners who far more than the host seemed to love hearing dirty  words there you go the listeners they love the dirty words the show started with a rapid fire  recorded uh uh recitation of george carlin's famous seven words you can't say on the radio  opie greg hughes and anthony cumia said several times the show doesn't yet have its full rhythm that's 
[00:57:30]  that's the truth we're still working out the kinks here but it still had the familiar loose feeling  their young guy audiences love loose they talked a lot about sex with anthony expressing hope they  could get a new wiffle bat to insert somewhere dark and deep into their guests that was such a  popular feature on our program the wiffle ball bat challenge please and keep the cop has brought the  old bat oh nice yeah when we uh were giving everything away from the studio the last time 
[00:58:00]  that was uh something that i grabbed and i knew it would be a returning feature because it was such a  big hit with the listeners we couldn't just give this away to uh some random i like how keith had  faith that the program would be back and he took it and and held on to the wiffle ball bat until we  did return i won't lie i did put it on ebay but it got up to about 175 bucks that's it yeah i put a  high reserve on it i just wanted to see what the uh actual what value of it would be right it's sort  of like you were assessing its value right right there's a lot of stupid stuff on ebay with our names 
[00:58:30]  attached to ridiculous things they're selling the xm satellite radio keychains that we were giving  out at the oh and those ridiculous cheesy cheap bottle openers those were terrific yeah they were  getting to about 12 15 bucks i saw on ebay i was upset i didn't grab a handful wow up there look at  that now is there moss growing off this bat uh i do i have the uh the original bat now i have a new  one for the new program all right very good all right we'll have to uh bring that into the studio  in a few minutes the original should be hung in here by the way yeah i'm a firm believer it should 
[00:59:00]  be hung in here to make every other host look at it i think this is our studio though i don't think  anyone else broadcasts from here really hang in someone else's studio then and make them leave it  there we really got to get stuff up on the walls yeah that reflects our personalities and  olsen twins sexual problems olsen twins no you know something i used to i i used to have the  olsen twins remember in our office i had the poster hanging up when they were all hot before they 
[00:59:30]  turned 18 and something went horribly wrong and they look like little hobbits now they look awful  now what happened the one look kind of look good all skinny but now she's all plumping up again  lindsey lohan yeah she's my new favorite all right so david hinkley writes they talked a lot  about sex with anthony expressing hope they could get a new whipple bat to insert somewhere dark and deep  into their guests they blasted howard stern as a whining hypocrite they said wnew's parent infinity 
[01:00:00]  once asked them to sign a contract that fined them a hundred thousand dollars each for mentioning  any other infinity personality including stern payable to me robin imagine we had to write a check  to him whining hypocrite and if i'm not mistaken yeah wasn't that supposed to be for like the rest of  our lives at one point yeah like we could be in an old age home blasted howard or the company and a  lawyer could just happen to be there and tell us that we owe him a hundred thousand yeah pretty much 
[01:00:30]  i was gonna buy my little rascal with that money they also assessed the physical assets of stern's  daughter yes we did that it says uh i i haven't seen a picture of his daughter you haven't no she's got a  big set of uh cans on her i saw a picture like there's one picture of them hanging out both of  his daughters hanging out at him uh with him at a bar or something that's been making the rounds on the  internet and uh they're a little chunky but the one has just got this great set of uh cans on her 
[01:01:00]  you could just picture flopping it out and going to town between them  he didn't bring them to the billy joel uh uh while i'm at the billy joel wedding perhaps a  black guy's doing my daughter robin yeah did you see that in the news  used to be great news howard news used to be fun and like great and you'd be like wow that was kind  of cool and stuff but these days it's like billy joel 55 married a kate lee 23 nice nice one billy you 
[01:01:30]  gotta like that you gotta give that to billy joel i'm sure it's because of his personality  yeah yeah two years and his looks maybe i think so and his driving skills maybe she enjoys driving  into houses well uh they got married at his center island long island estate after dedicating try a  little tenderness to his bride the piano man launched into a dozen motown classics backed up by 
[01:02:00]  young rascal felix cavallieri getting down now getting down were does that mean dancing to this  they were getting down they were boogieing in the night away was uh alexa his daughter christy  brinkley his ex-wife yeah he still hangs out his ex that's the weirdest thing man i could not imagine  that one uh howard and uh beth ostroski paul riser don henley jimmy webb phil ramone and andy lack 
[01:02:30]  all getting down at the uh wedding at the um center island long island estate wedding of billy joel  uh give me a break what happened to the old days i'm staying in my basement going through pornography  now it's out to the center island for billy joel's wedding 
[01:03:00]  yeah everyone's regular man with his model chick what the hell went on there  god but uh apparently he left his daughter's home  no it's not a male model stop it  all right more of this review from david hinkley in the daily news uh they reiterated that the  sex for sam contest that got them booted from wnaw wasn't nearly the outrage it was portrayed to be 
[01:03:30]  then anthony joked that on satellite they might expand the idea maybe into the muslim world we could  do sex for allah anthony said no i didn't i only have like three lines on this radio show one of  them is that we want to do a new contest called sex for allah they always get our our quotes wrong  in these articles uh talking about the mount st helen story see we did some local news uh local  local we did some news yesterday right people were bitching they didn't even talk about anything  happening in the news yesterday it's topical yeah it was very topical talking about um the mount 
[01:04:00]  st helen story anthony suggested that with all due respect it it would be justice if some of the  volcano uh rubberneckers got covered with hot molten lava did i say with all due respect i don't think  i don't think my quote was with all due respect i think i said i hope they get covered in lava  i don't think any due respect was there yeah i think you're some awful like extra from the sopranos  you know all due respect all due respect godfather i hope they get covered in lava this i cannot do 
[01:04:30]  my daughter those two men i want them covered in lava this i cannot do oh you should see the  volcano i built for you no i do hope that happens though because uh well these stupid idiots they 
[01:05:00]  rebuilt all their houses and stuff around the mountain yeah and they want to hang out they  wasn't going to erupt again they want to hang out and uh and look at it explode with their video  cameras and whatnot and uh i i hope it does and i hope we get some great video footage of them getting  covered in lava running and screaming away on fire looking like that little vietnamese girl  running down the street after the napalm maybe an ass quite that nice  oh they're they're stupid john kerry posters being knocked down with hot lava over them 
[01:05:30]  yeah blaming this on some environmental problem that factories are causing yeah or deforestation of  course and just watch a bunch of tree huggers get covered over with molten lava they were trying to  protest and hope the lava would stop and go around damn republican lava  all right and david hickley finishes up by saying launching what will doubtless be a string of  of complaints about their employer opie noted xm's main facility in washington dc is in a rough section 
[01:06:00]  he called chocolate city i'm a little offended by that myself well the xm satellite uh nerve center  we call it is yeah in the middle of the ghetto down there in dc yeah a little rough neighborhood huge uh  uh fences around the joint yeah it's pretty much like a compound yeah it's a little safety zone  armed security guards i think the dea's uh building a new building like blocks away from  they are like right across the street the xm satellite facility yeah subscriber response to opie and anthony  has been very very positive says xm spokesman chance patterson their channel costs a dollar 99 a month

[01:27:00]  so i guess about six years right but he he's never been able to hear the show because we were  never syndicated to la but with this xm satellite thing he can now hear us in la which isn't a  good thing i don't think he wants to represent us anymore he had no idea what we did i don't  think he really didn't he knew we were successful and doing great with men 18 and 49 but he never  really heard the show no clue what our show was he read the the magazine articles and the newspaper  articles and and this and that and when he came to new york to take us out for one of those boring 
[01:27:30]  meals he would maybe hear a break or two before he left his hotel yeah um but now he gets to hear  it every day and he's really excited listens right in the office listens on the way to work  excited to critique us is that what he's excited about he kind of liked the yesterday's show  kind of he said kind of i kind of liked it why do you say boring meals by the way  huh why do you say boring oh we talked about this yesterday i was just curious i don't know why  you'd say that bob bob is not a conversationalist at dinner no he sits there 
[01:28:00]  with his he's a negotiating machine that's what he's great at yeah he sits there with his brother  and we kind of just chit chat looking at the the clock anthony we gotta tell the lobster story oh when  i ordered a 200 and how much did it cost uh i forgot now it was like 250 lobster yeah i think it was  closer to 300 300 actually yeah it was we're at one of these 300 bucks fancy restaurants around here i  don't know on 56 or something and uh and we were really pissed at our agent because you know we 
[01:28:30]  were sitting out of radio for two years so we had to blame someone we're like bob get us out of this  stupid contract but uh to this day i'm convinced he didn't work as hard as he probably should have  because if we got out of the contract he gets out of his 10 percent yeah 10 from anthony and 10 for me  that's a lot of money to just give up because we want our creative freedom back right so he's not  going to be running to the to the phones and doing the right thing for us as far as our creativity 
[01:29:00]  goes would have cut uh his share of the money out and we're saying the whole time look you know there's  the clear channel and uh everybody pretty much wanted us at the time we'll make up most of the money bob  just get us out of this stupid deal and then it got to the point we talked about it yesterday where  infinity finally said no tough tough ass tough uh you're gonna just sit home and collect our money  and not work so uh so bob would come into the city i don't know every three or four months to  take us out to dinner and we would talk about nothing because nothing was new yeah nothing 
[01:29:30]  was going on we'd be counting down on to the end of our contracts it was like 480 days then he would  come back it was like 370 days it's like we're sitting there bob are you doing anything we're getting  older people are forgetting about us there's got to be something we could do out there oh i'm working on  it so we go to this restaurant and i could tell anthony was just not in a good mood now usually  it's me that uh is pretty pissy but anthony was like he's gonna show bob i i'm convinced you did 
[01:30:00]  on purpose they basically were ordering and uh anthony's like i want the i want the lobster the half  pound no the pound lobster i guess they're like we're out of the pound lobster but we still have the  five pound five pound in manhattan at like 40 something dollars a pound yeah so bob uh so anthony  goes i'll have the five pound lobster the look on bob's face oh i know he was horrified this is a guy  you know he he's pretty thrifty let's just say pretty thrifty he gets receipts for like a 35 cent toll 
[01:30:30]  that's it i drove around in uh california with him that is the truth like a 75 cent toll he gets  the receipt he's one of those guys receipts for everything gets pissed at it now because we don't  we don't mail him enough receipts don't mail him enough receipts so it's like no i'll have a five  pound lobster and the look on his face oh the bill was ridiculous it did cost about 300 bucks 
[01:31:00]  yeah i took it like all of it in a doggy bag and then i think right when i said take it easy i threw it  in one of the roadside garbages yeah yeah we were not happy but anyway so bob oh yeah i was getting  somewhere so he says yeah the show was uh pretty good or whatever uh but he he didn't like one part  of the show yesterday what part he hates frenchie who was that frenchie character he doesn't like  frenchie and he's like i think you guys need to get rid of frenchie wow like bob i'm not listening to 
[01:31:30]  you critique our radio show pick and choose what should be on the show i think we would have been pretty  successful with our radio show to this point except for a stupid little thing we did with st  pat's maybe you should have suggested that we don't do that bob but uh he doesn't like frenchie  wow well nobody likes frenchie really he didn't really like the fact that frenchie was using the  c word on the show well i don't think anybody here was really happy with that one i enjoyed it  i gotta be honest you like the frenchie yeah i actually do like french he's funny i like the fact 
[01:32:00]  that he used the c word it made me happy it's always appropriate i did think he was funny but  bob was very very concerned got me laughing bob was concerned the show was heading in a uh a direction  that he he felt very uncomfortable about and i'm saying bob but you've never heard the radio show on a  regular basis so i don't think he should listen no i don't like the fact that he could listen yeah not  at all can we have his um subscription canceled yeah i think we could do that we could do that  yeah frenchie is getting an ego is he getting an ego now yeah he called me he's like how great was 
[01:32:30]  i on the air you know by the way he's one of them that called me yesterday after the show one that  woke me up i'm trying to sleep and get accustomed to this ridiculous morning radio schedule and he was  one of the phone calls wanted to know how he did once he wants input on his appearances yeah try  pulling boss out of a manic depression last night i was just tired oh boss is the worst boss was  awful we all get those phone calls after boss is on uh the opian anthony show he always calls because 
[01:33:00]  he gets so depressed that his appearance wasn't that good he called he woke up and went into a  bathroom how is he supposed to be funny or good yeah he was awful yesterday he really was and we  really needed him yesterday yeah he was our big guest yesterday first show he was our star guest  guest the opian anthony show featuring rich boss right but he always calls up so so how did i do  how was i how was i get like but i was conquered and then he has a million excuses 
[01:33:30]  bonnie was sleeping i didn't want to wake her up i could even be tired with that spray of saliva  hitting his face all the time it's like someone throwing water at him  dude we shared a room in south beach and we played the dorale during the the hiatus play the  dorale spalding you're playing golf with rich boss today okay bosses boss snores and then stops 
[01:34:00]  snoring like you think he just died sleep he's the worst it is the scariest freaking thing to hear  rich rich did you hear the one about the colored boy but all of a sudden he starts choking in his  sleep yeah that's it right there oh i already you awful joe all right let's get something a little  more interesting on the show here i think katie's still on yeah i hope so hey katie hi all right  hi this worked nice katie's calling from valley street yep home of jim brewer yeah oh i was actually 
[01:34:30]  you know the story he tells where um the mall got evacuated because he called in a he said there was  a bomb threat or something yeah yeah i was in the mall that day i was like nine years old oh really  evacuated yeah that's that's one of brewer's classic stories he was working at sears and he called in a  bomb threat so he could uh have the day off or something like that right on all right so uh you  want to play guess what's in my pants yes i do can you describe yourself a little bit to our audience 
[01:35:00]  okay only if it's good and if it isn't um lie oh no i'm really hot oh how old are you 22 i was  hoping for my teen but all right 22 will do sorry um um about five five have long dark hair blue eyes  uh about 115 pounds wait i gotta get my scale out oh get the the graph are you going to the graph or 
[01:35:30]  the pie chart i know she's well within range very nice go ahead  hello i think she was done describing her oh that was it i don't know what do you want to know what  are your measurements if i could ask not to be tasteless but just to give people a visual picture  of what you might look like yeah because it's radio and we got to paint the picture paint a picture  that's what you learn in broadcasting school you got to paint the picture for the listener  um my bra size is 34 c i don't know the rest of the measurements so i never measured you a hippie  girl are you you have big hips or nice small ones no she's uh pretty small it looks like yeah yeah 
[01:36:00]  definitely i think she uh said she was hot and i think she's hot all right at this point we would  play the guess what's in my pants theme music oh the theme music but uh infinity broadcasting owns the  rights to that song no way hell yeah anything we did at infinity what if we re-record it uh we could  probably do the song itself yes record it so we got to come up with all our theme music again  yeah another thing to do as this uh show slowly grows over the next few weeks but just picture 
[01:36:30]  the song in your head it's time to play it's time to play it's time to play hey guess what's in my pants  right we need the theme song do do do do do do do all right katie you know how to play guess what's  in my pants yes all right uh we haven't played in so long i forgot the choices oh my goodness what  are the choices let me write them down it's there there's the there was the the wood floor earth  mama muff seven start from start from the top which is the 70s earth mama muff all right 70s earth mama

[01:37:30]  in the show sure the other thing bob said is i really like the fact that you and anthony are not  cursing on xm satellite radio you know that was ridiculous he goes i think it's just too easy to  just go on there and curse and and if you did do that i don't think we'd be able to syndicate you  back to regular radio it comes back to the money he could make if we're syndicated back to commercial  radio so he's like yeah i think you guys should continue not cursing on xm satellite radio very 
[01:38:00]  good thank you bob all right so there's the 70s earth mama muff yeah she will rub the phone on her  area down there right and uh but we can we can attempt to guess what type of hairstyle she has  just by the sound it makes just by the sound that type of sound right i'm so out of practice  on this but i'm very excited to uh give it another whirl 70s earth mama muff that's uh that's at the

[01:47:00]  house of blues what a disgrace that place is the house of blues they ought to call it the house of  lame white motherfuckers inauthentic low frequency single-digit lame white motherfuckers especially  these male movie stars who think they're blues artists you ever see these guys don't you just  want to puke in your soup with one of these fat balding overweight overage out of shape middle-aged 
[01:47:30]  male movie stars with sunglasses jumps on stage and starts blowing into a harmonica it's a  fucking sacrilege in the first place white people got no business playing the blues ever at all under  any circumstances ever ever ever what the fuck do white people have to be blue about banana republic ran out  of khakis 
[01:48:00]  the espresso machine is jammed hootie and the blowfish are breaking up  shit white people ought to understand their job is to give people the blues not to get them  and certainly not to sing or play them tell you a little secret about the blues it's not enough to  know which notes to play you got to know why they need to be played and another thing i don't think  white people should be trying to dance like blacks stop that stick to your faggoty polkas and waltzes 
[01:48:30]  and that repulsive country line dancing shit that you do and be yourself be proud be white be lame and get  the fuck off the dance floor now i thank you where the surfers go next is spamslicer.com presents megabyte minute

[01:51:00]  fuckhole you piece of  we really we really have to work on the levels man i know that just blew out my eardrums 
[01:51:30]  yeah here's what happens uh i need i need to control the levels in here i've just decided  because it's it's it's all over the ball field i'm gonna go deaf before the end of the week  here's what happens now begin with we our levels when we're talking throughout the break uh everything's  fine perfect when we go to uh our commercial break without commercials in it i have to rip these  headphones off so fast or else like a thousand decibels goes right into my brain this is the 
[01:52:00]  stupidest radio show i'm telling you any other radio show in in this high profile position they  would have taken a week to make sure everything was set and ready to go us i know we just go ah  we'll figure it out as we go here nah but i'm gonna go deaf i know steve what's going on in there  i think what's going on is you've got your headphones jacked all the way up because the  martini steve martini steve from the other room looking like he's landing planes i really don't 
[01:52:30]  like this setup uh all right fine steve's are in the booth time to do the news uh no what i was  going to say is it's happening to anthony too yeah but you've got his volume in uh you you're controlling  his volume as well what my why are we controlling each other's volume that's the way it's set up i  guess but the levels don't look bad here the levels really don't look that bad here so you're telling  me you're going deaf they look okay here so i gotta like immediately yank it down you know i think he  would be a better worker if he was drinking tumblers of martini for about 10 minutes yeah i think he would 
[01:53:00]  be a lot more focused then you hit that well what if i drinking curve is so short-lived like really  you could do things so much better after you're drinking a couple of drinks you know it used to  happen i used to be on a dart league and if you drank a little you'd you'd shoot darts great for  about a 10 minute window and then you keep drinking and everything falls apart and that's  how i believe steve is very good for 10 minutes and then he'd be like go after some yeah that's about 
[01:53:30]  it i really don't have much of a capacity there's really that's a kind of a awkward tightrope with  the booze i not anymore i got the capacity for it lasts about five minutes and then i'm enraged  yeah you just get all pissed off what's what's the size of your stomach these days um about a  couple ping pong balls jesus yeah you got the staple job so what do you do have dinner and then for  dessert have maybe a velement no there's no velement i can't i can't each year is this i can't eat  sugar all right steve come on the studio because i heard something else as we went to break okay the

[02:21:30]  opi anthony dance party weekend  wait wait wait  The Opie and Anthony virus is spreading across America. 
[02:22:00]  Tell your friends about Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  That would be a big help, considering at this point we're talking to an audience  the size of a college radio station.  That'll grow.  I'm adjusting my headphones again.  Me too.  They'll figure all that out.  All of a sudden the volume is up full.  Another nugget popped out. 
[02:22:30]  Did it?  When does this start becoming toxic?  Three days?  You're fine.  I'd like to know, when do we not have to wait for Opie to come out of the bathroom  so we can go in because there's only one key for 40 people up there?  I can't get my building ID because they want you to do it on Tuesdays and Thursdays  between 2 and 2.30 only!  It's the only time you can get your ID!  A scumbag building people.  It's kind of fun to try to figure all this crap out.  Yes, Ed?  Hello, there we go.  What happened?  Now my headphones are up full blast and I can barely hear me. 
[02:23:00]  Steve.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened.  It has nothing to do with me.  I'm not doing that.  What is Mike Piazza face in there doing?  It's up full blast, but I can't have it up full blast because it's going to kick in  and my head's going to explode.  Opie's board is running your levels right now.  Can you...  What am I...  Should you turn me up a little?  Oh, move that one right there.  No, no, no.  Ben, can you hear?  What?  That's not doing anything to mine.  All right, see?  Mine's fine.  Steve, you're such an idiot.  No, I'm not.  He doesn't control his volume.  No, I think of the volume volume. 
[02:23:30]  No, no, no, no.  No, that doesn't do it either.  All I've got is the one overall signal that you're sending to me, and then that's it.  Yeah, but you're supposed to make his headphones a little bit lower.  I don't have any control over sending his headphones.  I'll just say something.  Something changed from before we went to break to now.  This is not what I'm used to.  Something changed in between that time.  I didn't touch anything.  Because now I can't...  This thing...  I can't leave it up full blast.  I can't control your headphones.  That's not...  He's got it. 
[02:24:00]  He's got your mic volume.  I don't think he's got any volume meters in there, so he can't tell how loud everything is.  I don't like Steve behind the big board.  Oh, my God.  I think he went over to Shelly's during the break.  All right.  A little martini, Steve?  Hey, Rich, what's going on?  Nothing much, man.  I just want to make a comment on your gay promos.  Yeah.  I live down here in the Bible Belt in North Carolina, and that shit is funny.  It's refreshing.  He finds it funny.  Yeah, man.  It's hilarious.  I don't know what people are complaining about.  That shit is just funny. 
[02:24:30]  Steve, quick on the button.  This time around, we're going to have to wait four minutes for some music.  What do you do down there?  I work for Tentco Aviation.  Work on airplanes.  You do, do you?  I'm never flying again.  Wonderful.  You live out in the sticks?  No, actually, I don't.  Greensboro, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I know exactly where that is on a map. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  Well, thank you.  And he likes the gay promos, Opie.  Are you into the, are you into the gay?  No, no, man.  It's just funny, man.  I like bashing them on the head with a big wrench I used to fix the airplanes with.  We got a few of them out there that might enjoy that, though.  I hear you.  We need the Norm MacDonald gay bit.  Yeah.  See, that's another thing we got to find on the old show.  You find that, Steve, I'll be amazed. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, here comes Eric, sex bagel, who I think is still working for the show.  I haven't seen him all day.  Little blonde lad.  Where is he?  He's answered four phone calls, and he sits next to Steve.  That's his job so far.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  He's a right-hand man.  Y'all keep up the good work now.  You here?  All right.  Sitting at the right hand of Steve.  Yes.  Blonde Eric.  You want to call up this girl from Michigan for the second version of Guess What's in My Pan?  I would love to play that again.  Yeah.  All right.  Also, I want to thank the guy. 
[02:26:00]  Maybe he'll call the show.  He was on Fox & Friends yesterday morning when we debuted this mess that we call the Opie & Anthony  Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Right.  And he was yelling and screaming in the background holding up the signs and stuff, so it has begun.  Yes.  Yes, the invasion on the media.  The guerrilla campaign.  We love it.  People that get in front of live shots on the news or through the window of a lot of the  a lot of the news shows now, especially the morning ones, they have that fun little window 
[02:26:30]  out into the public and people wave and go, hi, hold up, happy birthday, Mary.  You know, things like that.  And we love when people just abuse that whole thing and put our names up there.  It got so out of control back in the day that all the news crews had their reporters up on  the news vans.  Yeah, they knew what we were doing and put them all over.  So they were doing their live shots on top of the vans because they didn't know when  the next Gumby was going to run out with the sign.  Or the guy in the guerrilla suit that ran out. 
[02:27:00]  That was during the nuclear plant leakage story.  Yeah, there was a nuclear plant leak and the news guy is trying to do a serious report on  the danger.  And some guy with an Opie & Anthony sign dressed in a complete guerrilla suit starts jumping  up and down behind him.  It's hysterical.  You sure he was in a guerrilla suit and wasn't a golfer?  We all got the golfer thing already.  Just ask it.  I want to make sure.  Yeah.  Well, we had two famous ones.  We had the girl that was topless on the Today Show.  Yeah.  That'll never happen again because now when you see those live shots outside the Today 
[02:27:30]  Show studios.  Not quite live.  That's all, yeah.  It's on a delay because of us.  And then...  We reamed it.  And then the one that was a story that was pretty embarrassing to my mom was when we  got the C-word on TV.  Oh, that was a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was some fun reading at the Hughes household.  The C-word.  It was on page three of the post.  What?  My headphones just got louder out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere. 
[02:28:00]  They just out of nowhere.  I didn't see anyone touching anything.  And they're back to where they were before the break.  My hands weren't anywhere near the board.  No, I saw you fiddling with that thing.  That was my volume in the studio.  What were you fiddling with?  I was touching my volume in the studio so I could hear you louder, but that was it.  I didn't touch anything.  Maybe yours didn't answer the same volume.  It might be the ghost of Scott Muti.  Oh, it could be.  Affecting us here in New York.  Oh, my God.  Mine just got louder, too.  What are you doing in there?  I'm not touching a damn thing.  Now it's too low.  Mine is low, too, by the way.  What are you doing?  Dude, I'm going to go up. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, could you keep those filthy Lebanese dick beaters off the volume?  Could you?  And that is now way too loud.  And that's really loud.  Oh, my God.  They're going to have to totally revamp everything.  Look, I could solve the problem.  Just give me a master volume switch right here.  I agree.  I could take care of all of that.  Maybe they could get Eric Estrada in here and he could fix it.  Eric Estrada.  That fantastic smile that guy has, whoever he is. 
[02:29:00]  Anyway, so we got the C word on.  Yeah, a sign with the C word being held up.  That was a biggie.  We thought we were going to get the boot from that one, too.  So whoever started it on Fox and Friends yesterday morning, thank you.  It has begun.  It has begun.  I think the video will be up on foundyourmusic.com or opianthony.com later on today when Steve updates his website.  Hey, Dylan, what's up?  Hey, who am I talking to right here?  O&A.  Hey, man, listen.  Hey, Jay.  I'll tell you what's up, man. 
[02:29:30]  I saw you guys' article on USA Today.  Dylan!  Yeah.  And I thought, for radio personalities, you guys are pretty hot.  I thought, well, I'm going to go ahead and give them a try and listen to them.  So I've been listening to you off and on in the last couple days.  And I need to know, with all this gay talk and shit like that, are you guys, like, for us?  Are you against us?  Do you want us listening?  Do you want us thinking about you?  We love the homosexuals.  We love the gay.  Hey, whatever it takes to get listeners.  You know, it's not my cup of tea, but, you know, if you want to do it, hey, I'm not going 
[02:30:00]  to stop you.  Hey, man, you know what they say the difference between a gay guy and a straight guy is?  A six-pack of beer?  Yeah, something like that.  That's it, buddy.  Nobody might drink.  I've drank plenty of six-packs in my day, and it hasn't ended with a dick chaser.  So I don't know how true that rumor is, my friend.  I even had the story of the treehouse. 
[02:30:30]  And I was drinking beer that evening.  Man, live in my circuit, man.  Sometimes it doesn't even take a six-pack.  I had a best friend that turned gay right in the middle of me being a friend with him  over the years, because we were kids, you know?  We were pretty young when we first met each other.  And then, I guess, going through puberty and whatnot, he took a little different direction  than me.  Is this the Tree Fort story?  Tree Fort with Richard.  The Richard Tree Fort story.  It was out in California. 
[02:31:00]  And, you know, he'd been my friend.  We used to go fishing together.  We'd get our little fishing poles and our bicycles and drive down to, or ride down to  Dana Point in California and go fishing.  Sure.  Just two boys, just two young boys going fishing.  And then we'd go horseback riding, because we all had horses and whatnot.  And we'd build tree forts.  Just things boys do at that age.  The tender ages of, like, you know, 12, 13, 14. 
[02:31:30]  And then, like, 15.  Or 14 into 15 happens.  And he took a little different direction, Opie.  And I found this out.  I found this out one night when we decided we were going to camp out at the treehouse at  the ranch where we kept our horses.  We were going to camp out, me and Richard.  Oh, God.  So we get up in the treehouse.  And, as usual, we're just hanging out, you know, talking about things. 
[02:32:00]  And I drift off to sleep.  Actually, I'm trying to go to sleep.  Richard, I guess, is ready to go to sleep.  And I think everyone's ready to go to sleep.  Oh, no.  The night's just beginning for him, though.  Right.  Okay.  Because he leans over.  He leans over and whispers,  Can I suck your car?  Can I give you a blow show? 
[02:32:30]  I've never heard the story told this way before.  And I'm like.  Are you asleep?  Oh, I'll suck your car. 
[02:33:00]  Right out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere.  We went from fishing and hanging out and just like two boys to all of a sudden him wanting  to give me the oral favors.  It's kind of like fishing.  You wanted to put your trouser worm in his mouth.  Hook him.  Yeah.  So, I understand, you know, that whole thing. 
[02:33:30]  That guy's talking about the gay thing.  It's not my cup of tea, though.  Hey, Dylan, you're in Tennessee?  Yeah.  You find a lot of action in Tennessee being gay?  Well, there's a lot of action everywhere being gay.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  So, that's right now I'm in Tennessee.  I'm just traveling through.  But I'm wondering if your buddy Richard there would come up with a different ending to that  story.  Oh, what?  That I yanked it out and he sucked it?  You never know, man.  You just don't turn gay, you know? 
[02:34:00]  What, you're saying I turned my friend gay?  Well, I don't think you lay in there next to him and turn him gay.  I think it's always that obvious, right?  No, he was pretty gay, believe me.  But he was finally...  In hindsight.  He was finally letting Anthony know that he was gay.  That's the point of the story.  Yeah, but, you know, the street community, you just don't go down to Dana Point and just  go fishing, buddy.  I know that area quite well.  No, you go to Laguna Beach and go fishing if you're gay.  Wait, how would you know?  Because that's where all the gay guys were. 
[02:34:30]  Maybe Anthony was sick and that fever junk was bulging through his young pants.  Oh, yeah.  All right, thank you, Dylan.  Thanks for listening.  Guys, take care.  All right, cool.  Music stops the second the phone hangs up.  Good timing, Steve.  Thanks.  All right, we got Jen on hold.  Hmm?  We got to catch up with our comedy breaks.  What?  Frenchie wants to say something really fast.  Oh, Frenchie.  Bob's not going to like this. 
[02:35:00]  Potty mouth Frenchie.  I don't know.  Bob's against it.  Our agent doesn't like Frenchie.  How are you?  Frenchie, our agent really didn't like your appearance on our program yesterday.  You were the only thing he did not like about the show yesterday.  Okay, well, he can go F himself.  I don't care.  Anyway, Billy Mac is the one who called me like, what, not even 20 minutes ago.  He said, hey, Frenchie, this guy, the agent from Opio Anthony, he said he was bashing  you on the radio.  He said, okay, why don't we go out there and get him?  I said, hey, why not? 
[02:35:30]  No problem.  As long as I have him next to me, there's no problem.  So we're going to go and take care of that.  I have a question.  Who's Billy Mac?  Billy Mac?  He's going to be...  Billy Mac.  How do you spell Billy?  Yeah.  Yeah, Billy.  You remember Billy?  Thanks for all that UN support.  Yeah.  That went well.  Yeah, like I can do something about it, huh?  I'm talking about your people as a whole.  Oh, well, what do you want to do?  There's nothing to do with those guys.  Hey, Frenchie, what's wrong today?  I just woke up, man.  Oh, yeah.  I keep forgetting we're doing morning radio. 
[02:36:00]  After a while, you feel like you're still in afternoon.  Yeah.  Doing the afternoon show.  Just woke up.  He's got to surrender.  Yeah.  Maybe take a little nap.  Cook some French bread and then surrender some more.  Is it hard sleeping when your white pillowcases are all on sticks?  No, you have it not.  What do you think?  You son of a bitch.  You son of a bitch.  All right.  Cook some strudel for some Nazis.  Keep them nice and strong. 
[02:36:30]  Go ask yourself.  And I'm sorry I was actually curting a little too much yesterday.  Yeah, you were saying the C word a lot yesterday.  Yeah.  That's like the atom bomb to the chicks out there.  That's what they deserve.  So, what do you want to do?  All right.  Frenchie, you have nothing today.  Thank you.  Yeah, well, I'm tired.  I just got up.  All right.  Well, could you give it a few minutes before?  What's that?  Suck it and die.  It doesn't even...  It's got no anger behind it.  It's a mellow Frenchie. 
[02:37:00]  You're too mellow.  You just woke up.  You've got to give it some time.  Yeah, well, I'll just take a cup of coffee, and after that, I'll be fine.  Absolutely.  Maybe allow another European to walk into your home and just take it over.  Over my dead body, you fuckhead.  Yeah, apparently not.  All right, Frenchie, this could be the end of your character.  Oh, I don't think so.  I have to.  You were really strong yesterday.  Don't get him sad.  I don't want to see him crying like that poor French guy as they were goose-stepping down  the major highways. 
[02:37:30]  Would you be a little more awake, maybe, if you were riding a bike with a little boy  on the back and a giant piece of French bread hanging off?  Hanging out of the basket wearing a beret.  Isn't that cute?  Isn't it?  What's that?  Isn't that cute?  With that stupid little mustache that they all have.  Yes, exactly.  All right.  Don't you like that, you moron?  Go give some chocolate to the Nazis.  There he goes, Frenchie.  Let's make sure Jen's going to hold on.  Jen? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah?  Calling from Michigan.  You going to play Guess What's in My Pants?  I guess I am.  All right.  We're going to do that next if Steve is paying attention.  Steve.  I need to hit buttons here.  Yeah, you really do.  I think it was a mistake not having the full board right in front of you.  It's got to be for Opie.  You're the boss.  You're the guy.  It's got to be you.  They're going to get angry because I think we suggested to them, Opie, that you get the  half board.  Well, I thought the guy that would be in the booth over there would be awake.  Sorry.  Somebody was actually tapping me on the shoulder trying to tell me how to fix this volume issue. 
[02:38:30]  That's all.  Oh, is that it?  All right.  All right.  Don't play the martini music.  But I thought that there was no way to fix this from out there.  I don't know.  I'm still not convinced there is.  Sounds like a lot of lies coming from that little booth.  I know.  That little liar booth.  That's right.  Liar, liar.  Alcoholic beverage on fire.  Guess what's in my pants with Jen from Michigan next.  Next.  Next.  Staring at my shoes. 
[02:39:00]  Trying to think of something.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  Placement agency.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, I need a job, I guess.  Great.  What field?  Accounting?  Clerical data processing?  I don't know.  Maybe something in the glamour industry.  The glamour industry?  Yeah, you know, glamour.  Like looking really, really movie star hot.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:39:30]  But what area of the glamour industry?  Oh, no.  I don't really want a job in industry.  Okay, wait.  Let's start over.  Did you graduate?  There's a school for glamour?  Oh, hold on.  I'm going to connect you to our glamour specialist.  Oh, great.  Okay.  High school dropouts earn an average of 42% less than graduates.  Hello?  Glamour department?  Some earn even less.

Come on.  Really?  What's it doing here?  I don't know.  Maybe somebody's pregnant.  Sometimes a pregnancy can surprise you.  So the March of Dimes recommends you take a multivitamin with folic acid every day as part of a healthy diet.

[02:41:00]  March of Dimes.  Saving babies together.  Parents, did you know that you can help keep your kids in school simply by encouraging them?  It's easy.  Listen.  Honey, I read your English paper.  It was great.  Wow.  Thanks, Dad.  If that's not enough to motivate you, think about this.  High school dropouts earn 42% less than graduates.  Someone will have to make up that difference, and chances are that will be you.  That means paying 42% of their rent. 
[02:41:30]  Or I could just live with you.  42% of their groceries.  Ooh, more candy.  42% of their trips to the dentist.  No, no, my candy.  And 42% of the therapy sessions where they will discuss you.  It's all my dad's fault.  Of course, you could save all that money by calling 877-4-A-KID and learning how you can encourage your kids to stay in school.  That's 877-F-O-R-A-K-I-D.  Who knows?

[02:43:30]  As tight as Courtney loves twat.  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're trying to figure out the volumes on everything.  It's driving the listeners crazy as well.  People are going crazy.  Guys, your sound levels are screwed.  Whenever O&A are talking, I have to jack up my XM radio  because I can barely hear them.  When you play the bit or go to a commercial, the sound's normal. 
[02:44:00]  All other times, you can't even be heard.  Great.  Getting a bunch of those.  Can't hear.  Too loud.  All right, well, hopefully we'll be able to hear this.  It's Jen from Michigan.  Hey, Jen.  Hey.  Are you a fan of the show, or did you just get turned on to this mess, or what?  I actually just heard about you guys.  Really?  I used to live back in New York, yeah.  And what, they said you got to check us out? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  He was listening to his CDs, and he was listening to an old show,  and I was like, who's this?  And he was like, oh, it's O&A's, and you got to check them out.  Yeah, our stuff is being traded all over the world at this point.  Yeah, he got it over the internet, I believe.  There's a great website, oavirus.com, that has a lot of our stuff.  Yeah, that was exactly the one.  Oh, very cool.  So you want to play Guess What's in My Pants?  Yeah.  Yeah, we brought this bit back today.  Slowly but surely, we're going to bring back all our bits.  That's what's exciting about the satellite radio. 
[02:45:00]  And this is how the show's going to spread.  It's like a virus, and it spreads from one person to the other.  Okay.  Do you know how to play Guess What's in My Pants?  No, I don't.  Still don't have the theme music that kind of explains it,  and it's a fun little ditty that gets everyone excited for the bit.  Eventually, we'll have that, too.  If she doesn't know how to play, what are the odds she's not going to do it, Opie?  You'd be surprised.  Oh, okay.  All right, what do you look like?  Pleasantly surprised.  Um, I'm 5'6", really cute. 
[02:45:30]  Uh-oh.  Red hair.  Uh-oh.  Red.  Well, they say really cute.  There's always something going on.  What's the problem?  Big hips.  What's the problem?  Little belly.  How much do you weigh?  No, I weigh like 150.  Oh, okay.  That's nice.  Very nice.  Nice figure.  Nice boobies.  I haven't got pictures.  No boobies.  That's the downfall.  You got pictures?  Yeah.  On a website?  Yeah, actually.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, maybe we should take a look, take her off the air for a second to get the website 
[02:46:00]  so we can take a look without our listeners pounding it.  All right, hold on, Jen.  Is this a website that's all about you?  It's like a Yahoo group page, more so.  Okay, all right, hold on a second, and then someone get that website.  Oh, my God, we just hung up on her.  Oh, my God, you're kidding.  I knew that was going to happen, and you know something?  I was going to say, make sure we don't hang up on her.  Oh, my God, that was my fault.  Call her back.  Let's just get her back on the phone. 
[02:46:30]  Shouldn't be a problem.  That was my fault.  I hope not.  It happens.  John, what's going on?  We'll get back to, what was her name again?  Jen.  Jen, thank you.  Michigan.  Yeah.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  You guys running some tight show over there?  It's absolutely awful.  I need more buttons in front of me.  Yeah, this is bad for me to come in on this segment.  And, listen, I'm a Republican, and I heard you guys on Hannity.  It was a big time listening when you guys were on N.E.W.  And, Anthony, I wanted to know, what do you think about Mr. 
[02:47:00]  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo over at K-Rock and been talking out against the president four hours a day,  every single day?  It's his prerogative, whatever.  I'm not a big, you know something, my philosophies lean a little more Republican and a little  more right than they do left or liberal, that's for sure.  But I'm no big fan of George Bush, that's for sure.  You're going to vote for him, right?  I'm still, you know something? 
[02:47:30]  Come on, we need a counter-offensive against that guy.  No counter-offensive.  Believe me, Bush is going to win the election.  But let's not be silly here.  Yeah.  If Kerry had anything going for him, I might consider it.  You know, it was one of those things where I'm so sick of Bush and his religion and his  bullshit, that, you know, I was looking for anything, any other option.  And then the Democrats put this Kerry idiot in there, and it pretty much, you know, if 
[02:48:00]  they could have gotten one guy that could have had something, something that you look  at and go, wow, that guy kind of believes in this, or he's passionate about that, or  the other, nothing.  You would have voted for Howard Dean?  Well, I don't know.  I didn't know enough about him.  You know, you don't really learn about these guys until you're a couple of months away  from the actual election.  So, you know, but...  I mean, I was hoping you guys would get a Bush for Bush thing going or something.  No. 
[02:48:30]  I'm no fan of his.  He's, you know, the guy, if he would fess up more to his mistakes or whatever, the guy's,  he's full of crap.  He doesn't know how to fess up to his errors and mistakes.  He passes the buck too much.  So screw it.  Do I like his tax cuts and stuff like that?  Sure.  Do I like the idea that the money goes to defending the country instead of the welfare programs  that the liberals and Democrats go to?  Yeah, I like that too.  I don't like when money goes to programs, social programs. 
[02:49:00]  Ugh.  So that kind of stuff I like Bush for.  But he's an idiot, and he's a liar, and he doesn't know how to fess up to his own mistakes.  Yeah, that's great.  As long as you vote for him, that's the important thing.  Well, I didn't say I was going to.  I would love you to.  I mean, all my friends are cops, firemen, construction workers, you know, middle class  guys, and, you know, they're getting brainwashed by that guy over there.  Believe me, no one's getting brainwashed by Kerry or the Democrats either. 
[02:49:30]  The far right and the far left are both equal idiots, and they're the ones trying to do the  brainwashing, and it ain't working.  You've got to make up your own mind.  All right, listen, I want to bore your audience to death.  Yeah, really.  Too late.  Too late.  Too late.  All right, thanks, John.  All right.  That was called filler.  We got Jen back.  It's our political break.  Jen calling from Michigan.  Sorry about that, Jen.  That's okay.  Did we get the website out of it?  Oh, no, we didn't get that.  No, we got to get the website from her.  Holy ass, dude.  She was on hold for two minutes. 
[02:50:00]  She could have got the website address.  No, no.  Eric just clarified that she doesn't have a website.  I was getting pictures.  Oh, you're just going to mail the pictures?  Yep, I'm sending the pictures.  Oh, she's sending them now?  To yellowtreats at AOL.com?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm just checking.  All right, Jen.  Well, we'll explain.  Guess what's in my pants as you email some pictures over to us, okay?  Yes.  Basically, are you in your little room?  Yeah.  How old are you?  How old am I?  I just turned 20.  Almost a teen.  First teen.  Just missed the first teen on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:50:30]  Almost teen.  When did you turn 20?  August 2nd.  Okay.  Wow, that is close.  Everything Opie better with the word teen in front of it.  Try it at home.  Anything even as simple as a blender.  Blender is just a blender, but teen blender all of a sudden sounds hot.  What about puke?  Teen puke.  Teen puke isn't as bad as regular puke, is it?  Nope.  Smells like Kool-Aid.  Mmm.  Nice. 
[02:51:00]  Smells like hubba-bubba-bubblegum.  Aw, Jen.  Yes.  You live with mom and dad?  Baby shampoo and cotton candy.  What?  I live on my own.  You live on your own, okay.  All right, you don't know how to play.  Basically, you got to get naked for this.  Oh, okay.  So, what are you wearing?  Pictures are sent.  The pictures are sent.  We don't even know where she sent them.  Wearing a pair of jeans.  Okay.  Black thong underwear. 
[02:51:30]  All right, you're going to have to lose that.  Do they stick out the top of your jeans?  No.  When you bend over?  What?  It's always a good look.  When girls sit down on chairs or something, and you see the thong come up out of the back  of the jeans.  Nice.  All right, take the jeans off and the black thong.  Okay.  All right, and what we're going to ask you to do is rub your phone down there.  Okay.  Right in your lap.  Right on your hair.  Okay.  And we're going to guess what kind of hairstyle you have. 
[02:52:00]  Don't reveal what type of hairstyle you have under any circumstances, okay?  All right.  All right.  Are you naked?  Yes, I'm.  Lower half, yes.  Okay, good.  Ugh.  Okay, ready?  What did you do, Opie?  All right.  Hold on.  I got to clean up.  What are you doing?  I don't know, man.  He's making a mess in front of him.  All right.  Cleaning up with tissues.  Well, I was going to explain to the people at home, you know, they can play along.  They get to guess as well.  And the guesses are the 70s Earth Mama Muff, better known as the pool rack with Afro hair. 
[02:52:30]  Uh-huh.  Also, the landing strip, Anthony.  That was called a mohawk, I was informed.  Oh, that's right.  Remember, we called it the mohawk.  That is where a girl shaves the sides of her natural triangle into a mohawk.  It's a strip.  Okay, so the mohawk.  And then the Hitler mustache, which is a modified mohawk.  It's the same as the mohawk, only you're cutting the hair downward from the belly button down toward the hot spot. 
[02:53:00]  I see.  And then the final choice would be the wood floor.  The wood floor, which is clean shaven like JonBenet Ramsey.  All right, we're ready to play Guess What's in My Pants?  Or Guess What's in Jen's Pants?  All right, Jen, if you will, up and down with the phone.  Okay.  Very interesting. 
[02:53:30]  Very interesting.  You get that, Anthony?  Telling, yes.  Okay, now we need you to do it side to side.  Side to side?  Okay.  Again?  Again?  Mm-hmm.  Interesting.  Very interesting.  Yes.  We're going to do the circular motion, too?  Mm-hmm.  All right, the circular motion.  Okay. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  All right.  Okay, I'm looking at a picture.  You're looking at a picture of me?  Yes, I am.  When is my internet connection going to be hooked up?  Wow-wee.  Yeah.  Very nice.  You're very attractive, Jen.  Is that the black thong you're wearing in the picture?  Uh, similar.  Ooh.  Very nice.  All right, do you need to hear any of the rubbing again? 
[02:54:30]  You were distracted.  I just need a side to side.  The side to side?  Yeah.  All right, let's do the side to side again, Jen.  Okay.  Got it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was very telling.  Anybody want to ask a question to help you along?  Are you single?  Yes.  Ooh.  And you want to ask a question?  Um, hmm.  Uh, oh, oh, you're single, but when was the last time you had sex with somebody? 
[02:55:00]  A week ago.  A week ago.  Okay.  That's kind of telling.  What's your favorite band?  Uh...  Hey, they just gave me a picture of your hiney.  Can I see it?  Very nice.  Look at that.  What's your favorite band?  Name.  Nine Inch Nails.  Wow.  Nine Inch Nails.  That's telling as well, yes.  You have a nice hiney, by the way.  Thanks.  Now, uh, people want to play, uh, they want to guest with us here, but I don't know how  to do that yet.  How do we conference two people?  Wow-wee.  Yeah, we got the pictures that are, are, are being printed out, and, uh, they're running 
[02:55:30]  them into the studio right now.  Very nice.  Yeah, you got small boobs, but that's fine.  That's okay.  Yep.  What a body.  I got clear stuff coming out.  All right.  Are we ready to play, uh, Guess What's in Jen's Pants?  That's not her, is it?  Wait, you do webcam stuff?  Yeah.  Wow-wee.  These pictures are even hotter.  Can we put this up on our website?  Huh?  Can we put this up on our website?  Yeah, sure. 
[02:56:00]  Which one is she?  Here, look at this.  Which one is she?  I don't think she's in any of these.  Hmm.  She does do webcam stuff.  Do you have sex on the webcam?  Yep.  You do?  Yep.  With who?  Um, with a few other girls.  Other girls that are in that picture.  In the...  Oh, girl-on-girl action?  Uh, no.  I actually don't do any girl-on-girl.  But you have guys come in there and have sex with you, and, uh, it's on the webcam?  Norton, stop grabbing your ass. 
[02:56:30]  I can't help it.  That's hot.  She's a dirty girl.  You're wrecking it, though, man.  No one wants to see you grabbing your mule.  I'm not.  In the old studio, the counter was high, so we didn't know what you were doing.  I like this.  It's perfect height to rubbing against the counter.  How old were you when your father left your mother?  Fifteen.  How old?  I'd say fifteen.  Fifteen?  No, younger.  Twelve.  Definitely younger.  I'd say eight.  Maybe. 
[02:57:00]  It's so obvious what she's got.  But why don't we do the circular motion one more time?  All right.  Go ahead, Jed.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  I know it.  I'm saying, um, my guess.  Now, don't reveal it until we've all guessed, and we ask you for, uh, the answer, okay?  Okay.  I'm saying, slip and slide, definitely wood floor.  Jean Benet, clean as a whistle.  I disagree.  I'm saying wood floor as well.  I say mohawk.  All right.  Jimmy says mohawk.  I'm on board with wood floor. 
[02:57:30]  Wood floor.  Don't you have to work?  I have to go back to the dig.  Aren't there some bodies being dug up in your area?  Don't you have to go shovel in a field somewhere?  There are a bunch of FBI agents on some tractors.  Get one crackhead says a bunch of bodies buried, and they start digging up the whole, uh, side  of Brooklyn.  Are they going to find bodies today?  Uh, that's, uh, that's what they say they're going to find.  I have no idea.  Nice.  Take pictures.  25 years old bodies.  But let's get back to the 20-year-old body. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, oh, nice.  And that's happening in Jersey?  No, no, it's in Brooklyn.  Oh, Brooklyn.  Okay.  All right.  So, uh, what'd you say, Keith?  I'm on board with the wood floor.  A lot of wood floors.  What'd you say, Jim?  I said mohawk.  Kev?  I'm going with Jimmy on the mohawk.  All right.  We got two mohawks and three wood floors.  Jen?  Jen?  What's in your pants?  Jen?  It's mohawk.  It's a mohawk.  How'd you know, Jim?  I could tell because of the inconsistency when she went left to right, there was a slight 
[02:58:30]  break in the sound.  It was like, sound, different sound, sound.  I didn't hear that.  Yeah, that's why you guys can say what you want about me pushing my big, delicious member  against things, but I listened.  She certainly did listen.  Very nice, Jen.  Wow.  Well, we're going to put your pictures up on our website, okay?  All right.  Hey, how can we see you on a webcam?  How can we see you on a webcam?  My screen name, Dirty Alyssa.  Dirty Alyssa?  Uh-huh.  Oh, I like that.  Stop.  Jim, Jesus. 
[02:59:00]  Look at her high-level.  How nice is that?  I bet you should drop a log the size of Howie Long's forearm right out of that thing.  All right, Jen.  Thank you so much.  No problem.  All right.  We can hang up on everyone else because I didn't know how to conference anyone to guess.  Oh, she was sexy, man.  That was good.  She was dirty.  Oh, dirty girl.  Real dirty girl.  A little mohawk.  Yeah.  Turn the cameras on.  All right, Keith.  We're going to get the wiffle ball bat.  I want to see what that thing looks like.  Oh, yeah.  And we'll do that next here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:59:30]  Wonder how long it would take to get a taker for that, Opie.  Those are usually reserved for girls that come down here live and have participated in some  type of pornographic movie.  We haven't had a live girl yet.  No.  Plenty of guys stopping by to say hi to the old boys.  Great.  Remember the one that stuck the asparagus?  Madison.  Madison.  Remember her?  The stripper.  Madison.  Madison.  Boy, you never see strippers named Madison, do you?  No, it's rare.  I saw one named Tiffany and one named Amber, but those were also anomalies.  Yeah.  You never see that. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, she took asparagus and put it in her back door.  It was great.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That was a funny one, yeah.  Yeah, but that was easy.  It's still funny, though.  It is funny.  There's absolutely no reason to do that.  Yeah, just take this, whore.  All right, take it out.  All right, let's do what we have to do.  Dumpster diving for ham scraps, you six-piece chicken McNobody.  I need an open letter to O.B. and Anthony.  Anthony, if your penis wasn't so small, I'd let you shove it in between my big teeth.  It's a freak show. 
[03:00:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You know, honey, I knew it was hot and sunny before I even got out of bed today.  Ask me why.  Say it.  Say why.  Repeat after me.  Why?  Because my balls were hanging low.  Let's say that real tight.  We're talking rainstorm.  Half-masked, cloudy, with a chance of showers.  That's right, honey.  The penis sinks for itself.  It's got its own brain.  Why do you think the head's bigger than the rest? 
[03:01:00]  I can prove it's got a mind of its own.  You ever get up in the morning and he's already awake?  He's dressed.  He's ready to go, right?  He's in the kitchen making fucking flapjacks.  You're in bed going, come on, Joey.  Five more minutes.  And your penis is going, take me shopping.  I need a new hat.  But you remember when they first came out with the hard-on, huh?  Third, fourth grade, you're leaning over like the hunchback of Notre Dame. 
[03:01:30]  Teacher calls you up to the board and you're like, I don't think so, honey.  You're the teacher, you figure it out, all right?  I got some kind of ligament over here.  I don't know what's going on.  This thing is like alien.  It's drilling into the desk next to me.  Call a cop.  Maybe he'll throw a donut around.  But you grow up, you learn to accept the hard-on to deal with it.  Accept the pee hard-on, you know?  That's God's joke.  You get up, you're late for work, you got to take a squirt and Joey's admiring the chandelier. 
[03:02:00]  You got to stand there like a moron and talk him down.  Come on, Joey, I dig you.  We'll dot I's and cross T's later.  Work with me.  Yeah, the morning hard-on.  I'll put that up against that Ginsu knife any day.  It'll slice, it'll dice, it'll pump your car up if you got a flat tire.  See what I'm saying, Cal? 
[03:02:30]  Ugh.  Heather.  Your wireless phone could soon double as a credit card.  I'm Kevin Eby with Chip Talk.  Since a fair number of people already take their cell phones with them everywhere,  several companies are working on technology to allow those mobile phones to replace their credit and debit cards.  It's called near-field communication technology,  and it's in use to a limited extent in Japan and Korea.  People there can load special cell phones with cash, a lot like a prepaid debit card.  They can then wave their phones in front of vending machines to pay for their purchases. 
[03:03:00]  Sony, Philips, and Samsung say you don't really need to be all that worried about security.  You would be able to set up your phone with a personal identification number,  and you would not be able to make any purchases without entering that number correctly.  And they say it is safer than credit cards.  When you dine in a restaurant, for example,  the server goes off with your credit card and could easily make a copy.  With this technology, you would just wave your phone at a portable reader.  There are no numbers to copy.  You can read more about it through a link at chiptalk.com.  I'm Kevin Eby. 
[03:03:30]  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  In the group.  Opie and Anthony.  Do some push-ups, fatty.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Soar.  Are you breathing?  Soar.  Are you breathing?  Now, now, where you gone? 
[03:04:00]  When you're alive, when you're listening to me.  I'm gonna talk about the biggies.  Now, someone is gonna die.  When you're listening to me.  The living night.  The living night.  Say.  Wake up.  When you're alive.  When you're listening to me.  I'm gonna talk about the biggies.  Now, someone is gonna die.  When you're listening to me.  The living night.  The living night.  Say.  Are you breathing?  Soar.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A lot of people bitching, Opie.  About what?  They couldn't hear the girl, the levels. 
[03:04:30]  Are you serious?  Yeah.  The sound goes up and down.  Oh.  We got some bugs to figure out here.  No one heard the girl rubbing the phone?  Barely make out what the girl's saying.  Seriously?  You should be grateful for that anytime you can to see on a woman.  Just thank God.  God forbid this was taken care of before you hit the air.  Hey, Ralph, what's up?  Hey, are y'all taking guesses on what kind of area she's got down there? 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  We did that already.  Oh, man.  I got hung up on before.  I tried.  What were you going to guess, Ralph?  I was going to say shaved myself.  Now, were you able to hear her rubbing?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we got to, like, this has to be taken care of before tomorrow's show.  I know it, man.  It's bad.  It really does.  Anyhow, about five years ago, I had a friend in Florida that had me looking at your guys'  website. 
[03:05:30]  I never heard you before up until yesterday.  Okay.  I was wondering who was going to be the first guy to come to XM.  Somebody had to come sooner or later.  Well, we really didn't have a choice.  Somebody would have officially came.  We like being here, but, yeah, right on.  That's good.  Well, we're going to spread the virus across the country now, the ONA virus.  That's right.  You're going to have a lot of listeners now, though.  Thanks, Ralph.  If you keep Frenchy off the phone, you might do okay.  Yeah, he didn't have a good appearance today.  He had nothing.  That didn't look very good. 
[03:06:00]  He stunk.  Thanks, Ralph.  Hey, guys.  Thanks.  Bye.  Our buddy, Andrew Gore, is on the phone.  Oh, from satansideshow.com.  Andrew.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Long time no talk.  Yeah.  How y'all been?  Hi, Andrew.  Pretty good.  You've got to explain to people who you are, because there's a lot of new listeners out  there.  I'm kind of an underground schlock artist and collector of freak, sideshow, serial killer  memorabilia, and big fan of the show. 
[03:06:30]  Yes.  And explain some of the stuff you have in that apartment of yours that we checked out that  day.  Some of the highlights.  I have everything from full-term, human, Siamese twin baby boys.  With the diapers on and the fish tank.  With the diapers on and a 20-gallon fish tank of formaldehyde.  That is the creepiest thing I've ever seen in my life, by the way.  Where do you get something like that?  Where did you acquire that?  It all came out of an old carnival collection. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, these jars and the chains around the jars, because they used to steal these things?  Yeah.  They're so old.  Yeah, I mean, they're antique.  They're pretty much antique jars and stuff.  How did the little babies die, or you don't know the twins?  I have no idea.  Okay.  The consumption.  They got the consumption.  This is very rare stuff these days, because they don't show this stuff during Sideshows  anymore.  No.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, all the Sideshows now are just mostly working acts, you know, fire eaters and sore  swallowers and stuff.  Boring crap. 
[03:07:30]  That puts the nail in his nose.  Yeah, but I want to see the real stuff.  Yeah, the freak show stuff.  Yeah, I mean, I want to see the human torso and the half boys.  So what else do you have in that apartment?  Um, the serial killer stuff.  I've got a ton of that stuff.  I've got the drainage grate where Abigail Folger got killed by the Manson family up at the  Sharon Tate house.  And I have pictures of the crime team photo.  So, uh, the, the shroud or the, the telly cloth cover, they cover Ted Bundy with when he was 
[03:08:00]  electrocuted.  Wow.  Woo.  With, uh, with pictures.  And I got that from the funeral home that had the contract with the prison.  You got the whole thing or just a piece of that?  I got, I got the whole guy, the whole thing.  Very cool.  Ugh.  What else?  Creepy.  I know you have, like, hair and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I have Charles Manson's hair.  I have, uh, uh, a few skeletons, human skeletons.  And you got a couple serial killer pen pals, right? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, I would think.  The one guy in Europe, I think?  Yeah, Nico Klaus.  What's Nico's problem?  The vampire of, uh, of Paris.  Yeah, what's his problem?  His problem was, uh...  He would suck it.  Yeah, exactly.  He would just, uh, drink blood for nourishment.  He worked, I think he worked at, like, a blood bank or a hospital or something, and he would  steal the blood.  Clever.  And then actually drink it.  Hey, you ever talk to, uh, my personal favorite is Edmund Kemper.  You ever talk to Edmund? 
[03:09:00]  Never.  You know who he is, right?  Yeah, I never have.  What did he do?  He was the, I believe, the California co-ed killer.  He's about 6'6", 350 pounds.  He's a monstrosity.  And, uh, you know, he did a little strangling and raping, I think.  I mean, you know, he ran in the mill, but he turned himself in.  What a guy.  He's a good boy.  Very bright.  Yeah, I've been really getting into, um, uh, I like Ramirez a lot.  He had bad teeth.  Me and him were pen pals for a while.  Yeah, what does he tell you from, from the joint?  I mean, for being the devil and all, he's a nice guy. 
[03:09:30]  Um, he just, you know, pretty much, he was really into horror movies, and, uh, I was making  all this, uh, uh, uh, yeah, merchandise and stuff with his image on it, and prison got  all bent out of shape about it.  Who's buying merchandise with his image on it?  Yes, I was doing the, uh, you know, Richard Morris doll.  Do you actually buy this?  Now, we have a, uh, a problem, I guess.  Opie, Opie more than I, has a problem that, uh, that you might be able to take care of.  Sure. 
[03:10:00]  Well, on the old show, I, I bragged how I was a huge fan of the pickled punk.  Yes.  And you finally gave me one as a, uh, birthday gift.  Mm-hmm.  I really want to return it to you.  Oh, okay.  I, I think it has brought me bad luck.  That, this is what I've been hearing.  And it's, uh, it's, it's, uh, hidden in my closet.  And I need to get rid of this thing.  The O and A, B.  Now, he, how do I dispose of this pickled punk?  Opie believes, though, that to get rid of the bad luck, that if he returns it to you, 
[03:10:30]  it might get rid of the bad luck.  Using the Mr. Hanalei Tiki from the Brady Bunch, uh, theory,  where you have to bring it back to the cave where, uh, it originated.  Well, I will gladly accept it back.  And, uh, it'll just, it'll be good.  Well, how do I get it to you?  I can't FedEx it to you.  Nah, nah, I'll come pick it up.  But you don't like leaving your apartment.  Yeah, but I, well, a lot of changes are going on with me these days.  I'm moving out of, moving out of where I live now. 
[03:11:00]  How do you, how are you going to move all that stuff?  Oh, my God.  I, I, I, I just got to get out of this city.  All right, where are you going to move to?  Uh, I'm looking, uh, some, looking to get, like, a warehouse in, uh, Pennsylvania somewhere.  What's the hardest part to move?  The, uh, the, the coffin full of dirt that you're going to sleep in?  Yeah, probably.  Or all the body parts.  Well, the next time you're up here in New York, I got to hand this back to you.  Yeah, I'll be up, uh, in New York, uh, probably this weekend. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, really?  You're doing a show?  Well, as well as all the weird serial killer and freak show stuff, I also have a huge collection  of, uh, of music and punk rock memorabilia.  Right.  You got some Ramones stuff, I think, if I remember correctly.  Yeah, Johnny just died, and, uh, they're just, uh, they're having a benefit concert for,  uh, prostate cancer in the city.  I think it's on Friday.  Do you have his prostate?  Nah.  Figured he might. 
[03:12:00]  And, uh, I gave him, uh, a bunch of my Ramones collection to put on display.  What a guy.  All right.  Any Sabbath or Ozzy stuff?  No, nothing, huh?  All right, well, uh, come by Friday, and I'll, I'll, I'll do the handoff, all right?  Okay, um, yeah, if I can't make it up there for some reason, I'll, I'll get in touch.  Can I leave it on the stoop?  Yeah.  We should just leave it on the sidewalk.  Nah.  But you know what?  That'll be a, a huge story in New York. 
[03:12:30]  Someone will take it, and your bad luck won't go away, because it won't be returned.  So, uh, how was it, how was it bringing you bad luck, just?  Uh, not ready to get into it.  I got you, sir.  A lot of crazy stuff has happened.  Yeah.  I will gladly take it back, and, uh, it'll be a good story.  All right.  I'll frame a whole show around it.  All right.  Thank you, Andrew.  All right, thanks.  Nice talking to you guys.  Welcome back.  I appreciate that.  Okay.  All right.  Keith the cop?  No?  Uh, yeah, real quick.  I just wanted to check with you.  Uh, is there a way to get in touch with you? 
[03:13:00]  Because when we take down the Norton apartment, I'm looking to sell maybe some prostitutes or  something to you.  Maybe I can get a couple bucks.  Severed bosoms.  Hey, where's the wiffle ball, Matt?  Uh, yes, Ben?  Can I just add something about Jim's apartment?  I recently went to Jim's apartment, and how funny it is that you have pictures of yourself  with celebrities all the way into the bedroom, and it's like he's got them at different eye  levels.  I can tell, like, he's got them with him with Kiss.  He can explain this, though.  The more famous the person, the closer you have to get to his bedroom.  Well, it's also, I have a lot of good ones up there, and I didn't know what to do in that 
[03:13:30]  little wall.  Bored a little bookcase and some candles on the floor, but I decided to put some celebrity  pictures up.  He's quite the decorator for being the mess that he is.  Yeah.  I'm not bad, and now one main reason, to be very honest with you, this is going to sound  very shallow, but I'm a nobody who poses for pictures with somebody, so when a girl  comes over, you know, you don't have to say, look, I'm a nobody, and I annoyed them.  Right.  She just sees the picture, and she's much more likely to come into your room and be willing  to take some seeds in the face. 
[03:14:00]  You think that builds you up a little?  Yeah, I know it builds me up.  I've actually had hookers stop and look at it, and I know they're not going to rip me off  and play games.  They think I have money, and they're going to be a regular with me.  I'm telling you, it helps.  I was actually shocked at how nice Jim's apartment was.  It's clean, nice, nice view.  Little Asian people clean it.  Oh, wow.  There it is.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  The famous wiffle ball bat.  There it is.  When we left WNAW, that was a yellow wiffle ball bat.  I see that it has a tint of green on it now. 
[03:14:30]  Look, compare it to the brand new wiffle ball bat.  There's a definite color change.  It's in a glass case.  This is the famous wiffle ball bat from many wiffle ball bat challenges.  Look at all the lines on the thing.  Yeah, the marks are still on it.  Why are you putting it on the gloves?  I believe he's taking it out.  You're going to handle the bat?  He's going to take it out of its cage.  I did bring the proper protective gloves.  You know, Andrew Gore would love this bat.  He would make a whole display around it.  Now, there are marks on it, depending on how deep it went inside the girls that were using it 
[03:15:00]  and involved in the contest.  And I remember a couple of girls actually did backdoor with it.  Yeah.  With the hitting end, too.  Yeah, with the hitting end, which is the fat end.  Look at that line.  Look at where this one is.  And it's marked A.  Wow.  As in A's.  And they were screaming.  Remember when Stinky went to administer it to one of the girls?  And she was like, ow! 
[03:15:30]  And he's turning it.  He was turning the bat, trying to get it to go deeper.  What a trooper.  So what are we going to do with the old bat?  You've got to display it in here somewhere.  Everyone has to look at that.  All right.  Put it up on the window, one of the window things.  I agree.  Maybe up above Steve?  Yeah, it could go there.  Yeah, let's put it over there.  That is true.  So when he comes in, maybe when a guy comes in and he's spinning shooby-dooby-doo,  he has to look up at that and fight the urge to vomit. 
[03:16:00]  Well, the wiffle ball bat is in the house.  Oh, that's great.  I think it's going to take a while to get a girl to break the ice.  I would hold it.  What's the problem?  You'd hold it with your mouth, you disgusting mess.  Oh, he's...  Oh, tears.  Jimmy's kissing the fat end that was used.  That's right.  That just skeed me out.  I can't wait until we pull it out.  It's got corn on it.  John, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Hey, buddy.  Listen, before you guys give that back, you've got the pickled punk.  I think you guys should do... 
[03:16:30]  You should take it out of the jar and, like, you know, throw it at some hot chips.  No way.  It would probably fall apart.  Yeah, I'm not touching that thing.  Yeah, a little arm would fall off and then on the console and fuck the volume up even more.  You guys aren't curious on, like, what it smells like or anything?  No.  No, not at all.  I have no curiosity about that stuff.  I just want it gone.  It probably smells like formaldehyde.  You know, it doesn't have any odor to it, I guess.  It's just a medical smell.  Well, it's deeply disturbing.  Artie from Yonkers wants to know, are you guys going to talk about GTA 4 before GTA 5 comes out? 
[03:17:00]  Did you see the trailer for the new Grand Theft Auto game?  Thugs.  It's like a Compton-based, L.A.-based game.  It's unbelievable.  It's L.A., Vegas, and San Francisco, right?  Yeah, West Coast.  West Coast, basically.  West Coast.  I wish we could say what we want to say about that game.  It's supposed to be more violent than any of the other ones.  We've talked to people involved in the game, and they're saying they're going to try to pull this from the shelves instantly. 
[03:17:30]  Instantly, yeah.  I love those games, though.  They've got the drive-by shootings and all sorts of stuff happening in that game.  Multiple players.  I start doing the missions, and then after about five, six missions, I'm done.  And then I'm just going around beating people over the head.  No, it's all about the motorcycle jumps.  Yeah.  Yep.  Well, I like the cars, too, taking the cars over the jumps.  And I try to get as much money as I can by running people over and then taking their money.  That's fun. 
[03:18:00]  But I like the single shot.  There's a little bit of skill.  Single shot weapon, you know, like a pistol or something.  Direct hits to the head, so the head pops off and the blood comes out of the neck.  You can't beat that in a game.  Love the head shot.  That comes out October 26th, I think.  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  Later this month.  I've been waiting for good games to come out, and in the meantime, I've gotten tied up in this goddamn online poker.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  You're not gaming as much these days.  I can't get off the poker. 
[03:18:30]  I'm kind of, you know, addicted to it.  Traitor.  I play that online.  No, because it's real money.  You play for real money.  How do you know you're not being ripped off like a slot machine?  That's what I am getting ripped off.  It's not like anybody.  I figured out, because as I'm playing, I'm going, how do they rip you off?  Because I got my little account, and it's got money in it, and I play my poker, and if I win, more money goes into this little account and whatnot.  But then I'm like, I understand how they, you never take money out.  You don't go, oh, I won.  Hey, can you now send me a check for this money? 
[03:19:00]  You just keep playing, and you will keep playing until you lose your money.  So it's not like you're winning anything.  I'm saying you're playing against a computer poker.  You're not playing like...  No, you're playing against other people.  But the computer is still distributing that.  Right.  So how do you know they're real people and not a couple of computer-generated people that is actually the company?  I have no idea.  They're ripping you off.  That's what I would do.  I have no idea.  I assume they're regular people.  They chat back.  Are you up or down?  Oh, okay.  At this point.  Down.  Down now. 
[03:19:30]  Way down?  Not way down.  About, I guess, 150.  Smarter to play online poker or the stock market?  Online poker now, I would think.  Yeah, I'm down about 150.  I was up to...  I took my 50 bucks when I first did it, and I brought it up to almost 500.  Playing, you know, the Texas Hold'em.  And then, again, you don't call up and say, hi, I'd like my money now.  You don't.  Can you?  I guess you could.  I don't know if they'd give it to you.  I don't think anyone's ever done that, because then you would stop playing. 
[03:20:00]  You don't stop playing.  You keep playing.  I don't know.  I play one or two hands, and I'm done.  Really?  I love to go sit down.  Oh, you don't have an addictive personality.  Oh, dude, I'm a psychopath.  I know you are.  I just like to hurt the other gamblers by getting up and leaving.  And leaving.  Hey, did you give me a chance to...  Nope.  I'm not.  Yeah, you've got to give them a chance to get their money back.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  That's the thing that Martini said in Cuckoo's Nest.  How are we going to get our money back?  You're not.  Mr. McMurphy has been running a small gambling casino in the tub room. 
[03:20:30]  Well, these things have taken off because of the TV shows now.  Every other channel now has the poker on it.  The Texas Hold'em.  Yeah, Texas Hold'em poker.  And now everybody runs to the websites and thinks they're going to be, you know, the next big poker player.  And it doesn't work that way.  I've seen people lose a lot of money in those rooms.  You get online and you see people start out with like a few hundred bucks, 500 bucks.  In 15 minutes, they have nothing left.  They're off the table.  It's got to be a huge scam. 
[03:21:00]  You think it is?  We've got to get to the...  You're on to something.  But he didn't know.  No, I assumed.  I'm not sitting there like I didn't know.  I assume that I'm being ripped off in some way, shape, or form.  But I kind of enjoy sitting down there, you know, playing some poker.  I mean, when you play with real cards, right?  A guy deals your cards.  It's a guy dealing your cards.  Whenever you play...  I play in Vegas, too, on the machines poker.  Yeah.  It's a computer generating the cards.  Yeah.  So the computer's not just doing it randomly.  They're deciding when you win.  Well, that's different.  That video poker's different. 
[03:21:30]  This is supposed to be a random dealing of a deck of cards.  I don't believe that.  That's being dealt out to all the different players on the board.  Oh, we had a guy that plays the online poker.  I want to see what he thought about that, but...  I love the online...  Is Steve drunk?  He's drunk.  You're drunk, Steve.  He's playing Kenny Rogers.  And it's too low, so no one can really enjoy it.  That was right on time.  This is wacky.  I need all my buttons.  You are going to... 
[03:22:00]  You tried to get out of it, Opie.  I need all my buttons back.  You tried your best.  You said, I don't want to be...  Now he's making decisions.  Yeah.  He needed Kenny Rogers in the middle of that break.  Right.  Right.  No, it's going to have to go back to Opie controlling everything.  You said you didn't want to control anything, but he really needs to.  That's my problem.  I understand.  Now you understand why you have to.  You're the guy.  You're the guy who's very good at it.  Hey, Chris.  What's going on?  Hey.  You play the online poker?  Yeah, I play online poker, all kinds of different online casinos. 
[03:22:30]  And you actually do get paid.  Last year, I took about $10,000 off an online casino.  This year, I've probably done about $5,000.  Wow.  What do you do?  Play?  You make some money and then withdraw it and keep playing?  Yeah, you withdraw.  You know, they've got all these different sites that you can use to pay for your online  gaming.  And then sometimes they'll withdraw.  Oh, I know how to put money in.  Oh, yeah.  I just don't know how to get money out.  Sure, but you're addicted.  You know, you win a couple hundred dollars, you withdraw it, and then two days later, 
[03:23:00]  you're putting more money back on there.  So, you know, you're playing just as much as you're winning.  I just don't take the money out.  I just keep playing with it.  Oh, sure.  You know.  When you win like $5,000, you think you're something, you know.  $5,000?  What rooms are you going in?  What limits do you play?  I play all kinds of different things.  Anything from blackjack, poker, you know.  Oh, he's playing blackjack online, too.  Blackjack isn't worth playing online because.  Basically, blackjack's a pretty boring game.  I like playing blackjack in the casino because you're in the casino and it's kind of fun. 
[03:23:30]  But it's pretty much a boring game.  Poker's kind of fun and, you know, there's things you can do with it.  It's not just like you're.  Right, because poker, you know, you've got all the different types of poker you can play.  It's not all the same.  And you could play with it.  It's not like you're at the mercy of the cards you get, you know.  You could bluff and stuff with blackjack.  You're just at the mercy of those crappy cards.  Yeah, but they've got you.  You know, when you get hooked by winning a couple hundred bucks or a little bit better,  you know, they've got you right there.  So they know they're going to give you, you know, you're going to get your money back to  them.  Somebody writing me on immediate feedback, Opie. 
[03:24:00]  Immediate feedback.  Saying that he's a heavy party poker player online.  And there was an article on MSNBC about how computer programs have infiltrated Internet  games.  So, yeah, I'm sure it could be getting ripped off.  But I'm just kind of paying to play the game, you know.  I know.  You know what?  It's actually illegal for us to be playing it here.  But the government pretty much hasn't said anything about it, you know.  Yeah, you're not supposed to be doing it online.  Are you saying they turn a blind eye to it? 
[03:24:30]  Perish the thought they'd not get their tax dollars.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay, let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  I was just curious.  What the fuck is a pickled punk?  Oh, good question.  Wow.  He doesn't know what a pickled punk is.  I guess we didn't really explain it.  It's pretty much a fetus in a jar.  A fetus in a jar?  Yeah, it's a fetus that's been in formaldehyde.  In the old days, that's where all the abortions went.  Into jars, and then they went to the sideshows. 
[03:25:00]  Don't you remember?  You ever see The Godfather when Sterling Hayden says,  I frisked a thousand pickled punks?  Yeah, yeah.  I never even knew what the hell it was, though.  All right, there you go.  Now you know.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot.  A new segment on the O&A show.  Now you know.  Tom from Niagara Falls.  What's up, Tom?  Morning.  Hey.  Morning.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Hey, guys, listen.  You know, I made some tapes of the old show,  and I listened to them while you were gone.  And there was this one episode from a couple years ago 
[03:25:30]  where Laverne and Shirley were doing the VMA Awards.  Oh, we love that one.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  And they're talking to some rappers,  and they're telling them about how they're the yin-yang party,  or the yin-yang twins.  And now here it is, two, three years later,  the rappers stole their yin-yang rap.  You're right.  Little John.  You mean Little John, right?  Right.  Tom, you just killed the segment.  They called themselves the V-yang twins, right?  You're right.  Good call.  I think you did have a point. 
[03:26:00]  Sorry about that.  All right.  Thank you.  Is it true that Lady Di and Marion went to Scott Muni's funeral  after they left here?  Yes.  Scott's a legendary New York disc jockey, Scott Muni.  He died last week, something like that.  Yeah.  We loved that guy.  He was great to us.  And they had his funeral yesterday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And Lady Di and Marion left here and went to his funeral.  To pay their respects?  Like they knew the guy in any way, shape, or form. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  They got in and they, poor Earl, I mean, you know, say what you want about Earl,  but Earl was pretty close to Scott, so Earl was, you know, going through a tough day yesterday.  They followed Earl.  They used to drive him to the stove.  Yeah.  You know, they followed Earl, and they, come on, Earl, how you doing, Earl?  How you doing?  Oh, so sorry, you know, driving Earl months.  How do you get, do you mean, did Lady Di and Marion get to sit next to McCartney and that?  I don't know.  They were in the church with all the celebrities that went to go see Scott, so, and they got  in, and they're hanging out like they're celebrities at Scott's funeral. 
[03:27:00]  Whoever it was probably figured they were just too awful to not be celebrities.  These, like, these two are too awful to be real people.  This has to be a feeling.  I'll pay my respects.  I'll pay my respects.  Oh, Bob liked the retarded Laverne Shirley yesterday, though.  Oh.  He thought that was a really good segment on the radio show.  Then we should never have them on the show.  Our agent now critiquing our radio program.  Putting his little ideas. 
[03:27:30]  His little ideas on the show.  Like the retarded Laverne Shirley hated Frenchie.  He's my agent, too, now.  I know.  That's right.  So, between all of us, he pretty much figures he has a 30% say on the show.  Pretty much.  Is that what he's doing now?  Not really, because that would imply that your 220 and my 10 were somehow equal.  And financially, I don't think it works out that way.  But Bob, also known as Melatonin, has been doing a good job for all of us.  Hey, Josh.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Welcome back.  Calling from Miami.  What's going on? 
[03:28:00]  Not much.  Just calling about the party poker.  Yeah.  And save your money.  I can't tell you how many times I've been on with a four of a kind, four tens, four jacks.  A person always has one better.  I don't know.  I've won some pretty good hands.  I've won with the one better, but it never happened to me.  So, the one better, you think, may be a computer thing generated by somebody who works for the company?  Yeah, without a doubt.  They're suckering in a couple of people because I think they get paid on the losses, a percentage of the losses per hand.  Yeah, because I couldn't figure out how they make their money. 
[03:28:30]  If everybody sitting at the table is a real person subscribed somewhere and they all have their own money,  all you're doing is pretty much trade money back and forth with different people.  So, how does the company itself, the website, get its money?  Is there a sign-up fee?  No, I don't think it was.  But I think every time that you lose, I believe they get a percentage of that loss.  A very, very small percentage, but...  Where does the money come from?  The money comes from you, from your loss. 
[03:29:00]  But my bet, if I lost $20 in a bet, a percentage is supposed to go to the website,  but that $20 is going to somebody that just won the $20.  But that person that just won might have just won $19.99.  Now, I'm not 100% sure on that, but I'm most positive that's what it was.  Not how it worked on the one I was playing on.  No, you're obviously playing against a computer game.  Believe me, I won some pretty good hands and, you know, won the money and everything.  I won two, but I've lost more so than not by two people, you know, me and another guy  going in and battling each other.  I have four 10s, he has four queens. 
[03:29:30]  It happens.  So, are you saying that you think there's a bit of chicanery going on?  Chicanery?  Are you being hoodwinked?  I know what you're saying.  You don't think the whole thing's on the up and up.  You know what?  I haven't played in about a year because of that, so maybe it's getting better.  I think you're just a sore loser.  Nah, I think it's a scam.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  Sounds to me sort of like you might want to use your head for something other than a  hat rack.  Yeah, I definitely think it's a scam and just want to say welcome back, guys.  It's about time. 
[03:30:00]  And you can curse now.  You're stopping yourselves every time.  Eh, don't worry about it.  We only want to use the curse when it's appropriate.  Right.  That's true.  But, you know, you keep saying instead of shit, go for it.  You'll feel better about yourself.  Occasionally, yeah.  Okay, thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, making his first appearance on the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite  Radio.  It's Black Earl.  Oh.  Earl.  Hello, guys.  It's Earl.  What's up, Earl? 
[03:30:30]  Oh, man.  Are you allowed to be on our radio show?  You still work for, what is it called now, Mix?  Yes, I still work for Mix.  Welcome back, guys.  Thank you, Earl.  It's been too long.  I hear he works for them in a limited capacity, though, not in the way he worked for them  when we were there.  Right?  How many hours do you work there a day?  What, 10?  I don't know.  But you're there.  10 a day?  No, 10 a week, but he's still there 40 to 50 hours a week.  Oh, okay.  Right, Earl?  I don't know.  Guys, you literally just woke me up. 
[03:31:00]  You go into work even though you don't have to go to work, right?  Oh, I don't know.  It just, I don't know.  I'm not even thinking straight at this point.  I'm sorry, guys.  You're a lonely man, Earl.  Earl, did you get any summer shoes yet?  You want to watch this?  Watch this.  Ben, go ahead.  All right, Ben.  Ben wants to do this.  I don't want to do it.  You do it, Ope.  Well, Ben and I went to a beach house over the summer and we, he hung up. 
[03:31:30]  Did he hang up?  Earl.  Uh-oh.  Earl.  Oh, no.  Look, he's angry.  It took him not even a minute to get angry enough to hang up on it.  Why did he hang up the phone?  Oh, he doesn't like, he doesn't like the story.  He doesn't like the summer beach story that Ben and I have on him.  He just showed up at a beach house with black socks and black dress shoes to go on a boat.  Yeah, we went out on a boat.  He didn't bring a bathing suit.  And he didn't have a bathing suit, so he had black, like, khaki pants on and a black, 
[03:32:00]  that's why we call him Black Earl.  Right, he always wears black.  Why did he want to go, did he want to dress comfortably on the boat?  Because he thought that he was going to be forced into the bottom of it?  Well, you know, it's like, you say beach, you say beach house, he would think he would bring a bathing suit.  And then he got mad because I didn't have a black bathing suit for him to wear.  So he's like, you don't have a black one?  I'm like, sorry, Earl, I didn't think about you.  So we're tooling around there in Massachusetts on Ben's boat,  and Earl's on the boat with his dress shoes and his black socks, 
[03:32:30]  and he's getting mad at us because we're making fun of him.  Of course you are.  Black dress shoes?  Oh, he looked ridiculous.  On a boat?  And even better yet, as soon as we got out in the ocean, I turned around and looked it up,  we went flying about 40 miles an hour right at a lobster boat's wake,  and all you hear is, Ben, Ben, Ben!  Was he leaving scuff marks on the boat?  Well, he brought a bag for his shoes.  Oh, because I was going to say, you're supposed to have...  Scuff marks is nothing compared to the boat slamming into a pole because... 
[03:33:00]  Oh, this is one of the funniest things.  Because Earl didn't know how to push off.  Now, they were telling Earl to push off because they're going between two, I guess, stanchions.  But, yeah, we're going under a bridge and they're pretty close together.  It's a tight squeeze.  Tight squeeze.  What you want to do is get a couple of guys up on each side of the boat by the front,  and when you're going through, if you get a little closer,  you're going to knock one of the stanchions, push off, right?  So they tell Earl to push off because the boat's heading toward one of these stanchions.  Earl grabs the edge of the boat while he's in and starts pulling. 
[03:33:30]  Pulling, trying to pull the boat away from the...  Imagine, if you will, standing in the boat, grabbing the edge of the boat and pulling on it  and thinking it's going to move the boat.  That's like the cartoons where you put the sail on your back and go...  And think it's going to move you forward.  It's cartoon logic.  Cartoon physics.  He was using cartoon logic.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  He had no clue that that wouldn't pull the boat over. 
[03:34:00]  So he doesn't want anything to do with us, I guess.  Why would he be mad at that story?  That's not a bad story.  Oh, he gets...  Well, that's Steve.  Steve asked him about it a couple days later.  Yeah, that wasn't fun.  Earl likes to...  Earl didn't want to be reminded of it, so Ben told me about it.  I brought it up very casually, and Earl flew off the handle in classic Earl fashion,  throwing things around the room.  He is so angry.  He is constantly angry.  We didn't even get to ask him about Scottsdale's funeral.  I know, and that's why we want him on the show.  I wanted to know...  Call him back. 
[03:34:30]  Tell him we'll be nice to him.  Oh, he's calling my cell phone.  Hang on there.  I kind of wanted to know.  All right, hold on.  Hey, Earl.  Earl, call the...  We'll call you on the other line, Earl.  Wait, ask him what the problem was.  What's the problem, Earl?  Oh, he got cut off.  Yeah.  You didn't get cut off.  He always says that when he hangs up.  When he hangs up, he always goes, oh, no, I was cut off.  I was cut off.  Who's this?  Who's this?  Hello?  Earl.  No, that's not Earl.  All right, he's calling back.  Someone on delay.  Yeah, remember, turn down your...  But, you know, what else was funny is Oak and I got about a mile offshore, and we just cut 
[03:35:00]  the engine and just both jumped off the boat.  Earl's like, what am I supposed to do?  I don't know how to swim.  And the boat's just, you know, just going along.  Really busting apart those stereotypes, not knowing how to swim.  Even better, Oak ordered oysters at lunch in fabulous Scituate Harbor there in Massachusetts,  and Earl was afraid of the oysters.  He's never seen seafood before.  What?  Yeah.  He was like, what the hell are those things?  What kind of a homoerotic time did you and Oak have together, going on the boat and ordering 
[03:35:30]  seafood in Massachusetts?  Did you take a little flight to the Cape, you fucking Marys?  What, to P-Town?  We picked up Parenteau.  Earl, what happened to your phone?  I have no idea.  Did you hang up on us?  Be honest.  No, I just, you woke me up.  I'm just sitting here.  All right, well, we just told the beach story that gets you all pissed off for some reason.  I don't know why.  All right, there's no reason to really get pissed off.  I had no idea we were going to spend the day on a boat. 
[03:36:00]  Earl, Earl, Earl, it's Steve.  You remember when I brought that up at N.E.W. and you freaked out?  You started screaming.  You were yelling at me.  You were yelling at Fabby.  Remember?  Can Earl hear you?  Earl?  Earl?  No, I didn't hear a thing.  Oh, God.  Ah!  We really got to figure out all these buttons.  We got to figure it out.  Steve was talking to you, Earl.  All right, forget it.  How was the funeral yesterday?  It was, as far as funerals go, it was very nice, except for when the funeral actually ended. 
[03:36:30]  And who was there?  What kind of celebrities?  Honestly, I mean, I just saw a lot of old friends, but there were two people I really did not want to see.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley?  Oh, yeah.  Were they causing a scene?  Not causing a scene.  It was just like, you know, you're leaving.  It's this highly emotional moment, and you're trying to catch up with people you haven't seen in years.  And just trailing me like, you know, like bad tissue papers. 
[03:37:00]  These two mutants.  Earl, I got to bring up an observation.  I think Ed's going to be with me on this one.  You sound extra black in the morning.  Does it take a while to get your white voice going?  No, I mean, I woke up.  I know.  You sound a little more.  You sound extra black in the morning.  Extra black.  You know, what?  That's one of the funny things.  Anyone else?  Do you notice that, Ed?  It might be because he's not hanging around with us anymore.  You know?  I think what Ope is saying is basically that when you wake up, there's a shiftless sound. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, my God.  That's what Ope is saying.  I'm not saying that.  I think it's horrible.  That is horrible.  Hey, Earl, we're trying to get you a job at XM Satellite Radio.  Well, that would be nice, guys.  What would you like to do here?  The public file?  I have no.  It doesn't have to be done?  You know, the studio needs decorations.  Maybe you can hang some pictures for us.  Do you have experience at that, Earl?  You guys are just extra awful now that you're on XM, aren't you? 
[03:38:00]  Extra awful.  That's what the X is for.  That's right.  All right.  Let's say goodbye to the golfer.  How's the Black Rock Coalition coming along?  It's going great.  We actually have a show tomorrow night.  You do?  Yeah.  At Joe's Pub here in New York City.  Oh.  Meet Earl.  All right, Earl.  You just brought the show to a screeching halt.  We thought you had a little more for us today, but...  I'm sorry, guys.  You literally just woke me up.  I mean, I've just had the... 
[03:38:30]  God forbid you get up before 930.  You know, I just had the longest week of my life, and I'm just trying to, like, start over.  All right.  Hang in there, Earl.  We'll talk to you soon, okay?  All right, guys.  Welcome to XM.  Thank you.  Thank you, Earl.  All right.  She's cute.  The girl on TV right now, Kev just pointed out, is that little...  Ugh!  That stump is really awful.  Bethany Hamilton.  Oh, the surfer that got her arm bitten off by a shark.  I don't mind that, because that's one less you have to hold down.  But my question is, do you have to wear a tank top with that awful... 
[03:39:00]  Wow.  It looks like a giant thumb on her shoulder.  That really is bad.  Horrendous.  I like her brace face, though.  Yeah, I like braces.  I like them.  But I don't like that one arm.  I don't like her confidence with one arm.  Like, I've got one arm, and I'll be proud of it.  It's awful.  Cover it.  Yeah, she's wearing the tank top.  She's already surfing again, too.  Yeah.  And winning competitions.  Get out.  Yep.  She's winning.  I swear to God.  One arm.  I understand her and McCartney's wife were...  What?  I don't know.  I didn't have a funny thought to follow it up.  I thought that the two amputees put together would be humorous enough, but I was dreadfully wrong. 
[03:39:30]  All right.  With that, we have to...  I don't know why we have to take breaks if we don't have any sponsors.  I don't really get that.  To get used to it, it's a timing thing, I think, that the company wants.  Oh, really?  I have no idea.  I just wanted to add something.  All right.  We got this feedback thing.  You can get to it through opiananthony.com, and I think we're ready to play What Did We  Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  Oh, it was an educational show today.  So we'll read some of those next.  Dude.  Six monkeys and a turd-throwing party.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:40:00]  Because we used to have empires.  Oh, yeah, we used to.  Everyone had an empire.  France and Spain and Britain and Turkey.  The Ottoman Empire, full of furniture for some reason.  And the Austro-Hungarian Empire, famous for fuck all.  All they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard.  And the German Empire, very Prussian, very organized, always building an empire.  Build an empire, build an empire, and fight, and fight, build an empire. 
[03:40:30]  And then they'd celebrate with the World War, and then lose the whole fucking empire by the  end of the world.  Then the 30s, Hitler, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, Second World War, Russian Front, not  a good idea.  Hitler never played Risk when he was a kid.  Because we know it was impossible to hold on to that Asia, Eastern Europe area, wasn't  it?  You know.  In Risk.  You know, seven extra men.  We've all played it. 
[03:41:00]  Seven extra men at the beginning of every go for that Asia bit, but you could never hold  it, could you?  Azerbaijan would fuck off somewhere, and then fucking Siberia.  Come on, Ukraine.  Hang on there.  Fuck it.  Australasia.  That was the smart move, wasn't it?  The purples.  Get everyone on Papua New Guinea, and just filled up forces saying, fuck off to everyone.  You'd never attack anyone.  You'd just get bigger and bigger and bigger.  Yes.  And I think America, because you're the new Roman Empire.  You know that?  Yeah.  You're the new, there's no other big, you know, country. 
[03:41:30]  You're the Roman Empire now.  There's no one else going, really.  China's there, big and large, but kind of, and kind of, they're just trying to do a bit  of housekeeping at the moment.  And so you've got vomitariums and orgies to look forward to.  I think you've already covered orgies, but vomitariums is the future.  Maybe that's in the bulimic area.  I don't know.  But, um, because I get the impression that America, after the Second World War, would  really like to have built up an empire, but, you know, everyone else in the world would 
[03:42:00]  go, well, you can't now.  We've just given that up, you know.  Television networks are going online.  I'm Kevin Eby with Chip Talk.  It's the start of the fall television season, and the networks are rolling out a number  of new shows.  But some of those shows aren't so new.  At least if you have a high-speed internet connection.  This season, the Warner Brothers television network began testing some of its new shows  on the internet, previewing them online as much as a month before they first showed up  on the primetime lineup.  The idea of previews is not new.  TV networks and movie studios often invite select audiences to rented theaters to watch 
[03:42:30]  shows before they're generally available.  It gives them some early feedback and helps generate publicity.  But people are busy, and it's hard to round up a huge group, especially for lesser-known  shows.  The WB figured a good portion of its target audience, younger viewers, are online and  have high-speed connections and would be willing to download some preview shows.  In fact, it says a good number of people checked out the previews.  I won't say how many, though.  Watch the whole show.  I'm Kevin Eby. 
[03:43:00]  Spirit is invisible.  It is soundless.  Liquid metal can make you deaf, and your ears might bleed.  It is without texture, without taste, without smell.  It is dimensionless, spaceless, and timeless.  Channel 42!  Ow, my throat hurts.  Liquid metal.  One of 100 channels on XM Satellite Radio. 
[03:43:30]  XM 46.  Moments after the Jimi Hendrix experience reduced the stage to ashes at the Monterey Pop Festival  in 1967, it was clear Jimi's incendiary guitar playing had finally converted the American audience  to his electric vision.  Jimi first took up the guitar in his early teens, religiously jamming to blues heroes Muddy Waters  and Robert Johnson.  The Jimi Hendrix experience.  Top tracks at XM 46. 
[03:44:00]  All was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Uh, complete whores.  Bopey and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Desecration against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Bopey's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex.  Bopey and Anthony!  Bopey and Anthony! 
[03:44:30]  Bopey and Anthony!  Bopey and Anthony!  Bopey and Anthony!  Uh-oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing, and then when they go too far, they  suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Bopey and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh my God, is this a bad one? 
[03:45:00]  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Bopey and Anthony, we're back now at the new climate of the radio.  Ho, ho, Bopey.  Shut up! 
[03:45:30]  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony are so beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  Opie and Anthony.  We stink.  It's just about time to play What Do We Learned on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  I learned to have another day in bed.  Oh, really?  Still sickly?  Not as bad as yesterday.  You told me it would be a three-day thing, right?  Yeah, you get it really bad.  One day, it's really, really bad.  This is the worst cold I've ever had in my life.  Yeah, awful.  Just not like a faucet.  Norton, you learn anything today?  No, but if you'd like me to come over maybe later, rub something on your back.  A little Vicks.  Vicks Vapo rub on his chest.  On your hairless blonde chest. 
[03:46:30]  Little pink nipples.  Hey, Larry from New Orleans.  What's up?  Yo, I learned that Anthony hates Bush.  Very good.  I think he just dislikes it.  He has a strong word when it comes to Bush.  I hate Bush.  Oh, you did it?  No, I didn't really say that.  I don't think he hates Bush.  No, I'm just, I think Bush is a liar.  Speaking of New Orleans, we've got to find Tom. 
[03:47:00]  We have to find Tom, see if he's still alive.  Our old pal from our old radio show.  Yeah, he got cans.  Doesn't Tom share an office with Guy Bannister?  They let you drink right here in the airport.  He got, after our whole thing, he would prank call me going,  take your order, please.  You know, like joking around with me.  And then, like two weeks after we got canceled,  he got fired from his second radio job down there.  You know, we're going to have to talk about New Orleans maybe tomorrow.  That whole story is just legendary with Tom that ran the station. 
[03:47:30]  When we went down there to do Mardi Gras.  We broadcast live from Mardi Gras and just were drunk.  We almost got kicked out of Mardi Gras because the girl was giving the BJ live on the show.  Yeah.  No one gets kicked out of Mardi Gras.  We just about did.  Inflicting wounds on people with those god-awful beads.  Yep.  Hey, Mike from Staten Island, what did you learn?  What's up, guys?  Welcome back.  Opie, sorry about your loss, man.  Oh, thanks, bro.  I learned, for some reason, colored people are now called golfers. 
[03:48:00]  Colored?  What decade are we living in?  I'll see you guys later.  You guys still talk.  Colored?  All right.  Someone figured that out.  Henchman from Brooklyn.  I learned that there are still some things ONA can't talk about, like video games.  Well, when it comes to Grand Theft Auto, the new game, we got some things we do want to say.  Some things going on.  Well, we kind of signed some things.  Yeah.  That's all we're trying to say, if you think about it, really.  It has nothing to do with, you know, FCC or anything like that.  Don't worry about it.  We'll spill the beans when the game comes out. 
[03:48:30]  Harry from Long Island, I learned today that black girl's phone service deteriorates with how angry he gets.  Very true.  I don't know what happened, guys.  He hung up on us.  John from Maryland, what's up?  Hey, I learned today that I really missed cigarettes, coffee, and ONA.  Cigarettes, coffee.  Why are the cigarettes and the coffee?  You gave that up?  Pretty much.  But nothing beats listening to you guys with cigarettes and coffee unless it's beer and Jack Daniels. 
[03:49:00]  All right.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  See, Eric, if you write what they learned on the screen, then I could do some editing.  And I could pick the better ones.  And then we look like radio superstars.  Geniuses.  We look like radio superstars at our old job because we had it all figured out.  It was so all figured out.  All the tricks of the trade.  We had that bad equipment working.  Remember that?  Larry from Jersey, I learned that Anthony doesn't think he ever paid for sex but had an expensive three-way. 
[03:49:30]  Sam Smith from Jersey, I learned today, though impressive, Jim's mule doesn't measure up to Ant's fever junk.  Fever junk, yeah.  Ah, Philly checking in.  Right on.  Johnny, today I learned that your show is still hard effing here.  Paul from North Carolina, I learned on the road to rebuilding the show, today was one more gooder.  One more gooder.  It wasn't bad.  We added what's in my pants today.  It was nice.  Tomorrow we're going to try to find some stoners that are smoking their pot nice and early for stoner spelling me. 
[03:50:00]  I like touching on familiar ground.  But if you're smoking the pot really early in the morning, you think they could afford the XM satellite radio?  Something to think about for tomorrow.  Hmm.  Hmm.  You could just say it.  Big Kev has one.  I learned that the C in Steve C is for combative.  Yes, we did learn that.  Andy from Vermont, what's up, buddy?  Hey, how you doing, Opie?  He's all mad back there now.  Why?  He needs a martini. 
[03:50:30]  He's just about ready for his first martini of the day.  Of course, Steve.  What's up, Andy?  What I learned today was not only do Opie and Anthony have the broadcast audience of a college radio station,  but the production value of one, too.  And the equipment.  This is state-of-the-art equipment.  Some day we're going to figure this out.  You can throw in the advertisers, too.  How'd you guys land that XM radio ad?  Pretty good.  Is that all they got when we go to break?  That's right.  Advertisements for something that people already have.  We're sponsored by XM. 
[03:51:00]  Nice.  All right.  Thanks, Andy.  Thank you.  Okay.  Eric from Jersey.  I learned today that you can put the word teen in front of anything to make it sound better.  You got another example of that, Anthony?  Of what?  The whole teen concept, how it makes things sound better?  Or teen, the word teen, put it in front of anything, and it sounds better.  Although somebody put man boobs on immediate feedback, and teen man boobs, I think you might have found one that doesn't quite work. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  But it does sound better than regular man boobs.  At least that they're teen.  I will say anything's an improvement over man boobs.  Teen, at least you know they're smooth.  True.  Yes.  All right.  So it still works.  Jason from New Hampshire, what did you learn on the show today?  The callers have learned it's okay to say, fuck the fucking fuckers.  The callers love the F word.  They love it more than we do so far.  It's Cram from Yonkers.  I learned today that why French... 
[03:52:00]  Oh, I learned why Frenchie's pillowcases are not on his bed, French faggot.  And Peter from Brooklyn, I learned the invisible man hung up on Earl's phone.  Have a couple of examples here, Opie, from immediate feedback.  Jesus.  Slumber party.  Teen slumber party.  Now stop it.  That's great.  And bleeding.  Teen bleeding.  And then teen bleeding.  Somehow it's just better.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Brian.  What's up, Brian?  Brian. 
[03:52:30]  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Isn't it Brian?  No, not quite.  All right.  What's up, Brian?  I learned that I got to get my ass up earlier in the morning.  Why?  Because I just can't seem to catch a show.  No, we do the replay all day long.  Yeah, that's true.  But...  By the time midnight rolls around, you're so sick of this show.  That's what I learned.  So what do you think the Twins are going to do tonight there, Brian?  Um, I don't know.  I don't want sports.  Oh, all right.  Okay.  Loser. 
[03:53:00]  Not you, the Twins.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you, dude.  Not you, too.  Uh, Cage from Long Island.  I learned today Anthony can't turn anything on.  I learned the studio needs some posters.  I learned Bob hates Frenchie.  I learned Norton's breakfast looked like puke, and he's a master decorator.  Is this Bob Kelly?  The Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  Oh, is that Bobby from, uh...  Is he listening every day?  He should just call the show.  Yeah, he also commented on your poker.  Said you're terrible to play poker with. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, I did play with that dumb Bob, and he had...  Well, this is what he wrote about you.  I just...  Fucking nervous, thin-lipped idiot.  He should just call the show with this instead of writing it on the feedback.  Bob doesn't, you know, he's just like, all right, I'll call.  Bob Kelly writes,  Jim Norton is the fucking worst person to play poker with.  He wins one big hand five minutes in the game  and cashes out all his chips,  runs upstairs to use your money to pay a hooker to drop logs on his chest.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, robertkellylive.com. 
[03:54:00]  That's Bob.  Self-plugging jackass.  That is him.  And STD from Long Island writes,  I learned that Michael Jackson is smart.  The young boys are extra hairless with cancer.  Excellent.  Are we about done with this thing?  We have a few more minutes yet.  I'd hate to cheat people out of a few minutes of the show.  Here it goes.  Go ahead, Jim.  I don't have anything to say at all.  Yeah, you do.  Don't you have something to say about Albany?  Who cares about Albany?  Dude, I'm about being with you.  That stupid Palace Theater gig in Albany on Friday means nothing to me.  Do I care if you can go to Ticketmaster and get tickets? 
[03:54:30]  Big deal.  Me, Bobby Slate, and Jim Florentine.  Who gives a shit?  Rich Voss, you stay home in Albany on Friday.  Forget the Palace Theater.  AJ from DC, he learned that O&A are brought to you by George Carlin.  A lot of George Carlin bits today.  Yeah.  I'm sure they'll fix that in the replay.  It'll be all dice bits or something.  I think they change them or something.  They do change them right in between the replays.  Yeah, someone told me.  Yeah, so when we comment on them, when we come back, we sound like idiots.  Yeah.  Which we do anyway.  Cringe box from the Empire State Building. 
[03:55:00]  I learned that streaming the show to hillbillies can have unpredictable results on the phones.  Phil from Philly, I finally learned why my sack looks like two hard-boiled eggs in a wet sock when I'm sick.  Hey, that's good, bro.  And Tom from Paramus, I learned today not to go fishing with your friend and then go to his house for a sleepover,  no matter how straight you think he might be.  There you go.  All right.  I think we're done.  So tomorrow on the show, oh, whip them out Wednesday. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, our first Wednesday back.  You know, we've got to start the whole whip them out Wednesday phenomenon from scratch again.  All over again.  Because we don't have the wow stickers.  They promised me wow stickers, I don't know, a month ago.  Yeah.  There was supposed to be something right on the XM Radio website where you just leave your address and they would send out the wow stickers.  I don't think that's set up yet, is it?  No?  No.  All right, so we're going to have to have people make their homemade signs, I guess.  And if you don't know what whip them out Wednesday is all about, you'll have to tune in the show tomorrow, right?  Yep.  Okay. 
[03:56:00]  Jersey Ollie writes, I learned amputees and tank tops are easier to hold down.  Doughboy from New Brunswick, I learned that Opie's first dump in two and a half days was only a nugget.  I've popped two nuggets so far today.  Bill from Northern VA, I learned that black girl is blacker in the mornings.  And what else are we doing?  We're going to try the stoner spelling bee?  Yeah, I think our top priority, though, is getting these sound things right.  We've got to get our sound levels right.  Well, they're going to work on it.  Look at all these guys around here.  One guy's climbing up to the ceiling.  Yeah, they're ready to run in here. 
[03:56:30]  What does the Gary Shanley-looking guy do who kind of runs the whole place in a blue shirt?  What does that psychopath do?  We're going to do the IDs at 1030, and he smiles at me, and I walk away.  He's an uncomfortable, weird guy.  Who is he?  That's Bruce.  He's going to kick your ass, bro.  Bruce has been very nice.  He's a very nice guy, but I don't know who he is.  He's frightening.  I want to make it clear that I haven't made fun of anyone that works here yet.  Neither have I.  I just want to know who he was.  You made fun of everybody.  You made fun of the Frank's Place guy.  That guy's terrific.  None against him.  You made fun of Bruce. 
[03:57:00]  I like Bruce.  I just didn't know who he was or what he did.  I just know that he...  I made fun of the building guy.  All right.  Steve is saying we've got to get the hell out of here, so...  He was just pointing up.  Like he knows.  I thought he was ordering a drink.  He put one finger up.  I thought he was saying bartender.  That's what the C stands for.  Or could I please have another?  We'll see you tomorrow at 6.  Or if you missed this mess and you're just tuning in, stick around.  We're going to replay the show now.  Sure.  All right.  Do it.  Opie and Anthony.  I saw them in the hall once.  They looked like they had salt packages. 
[03:57:30]  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love New York City.  Oh, yeah.  New York City.  I love New York City.  Oh, yeah.  New York City.  New York City. 
[03:58:00]  Next week.  Amen. 
[03:58:30]  Amen. 
[03:59:00]  And it was a real legitimate wet dream.  No masturbating.  I didn't even know what masturbating was yet.  And I was like 12 years old.  And my mom used to make my bed and do my laundry.  And I remember I was getting ready for school.  And she calls me into the room and goes,  Robert, is there something you need to tell me today?  Yeah, don't sit over there.  Because that's still a little damp to the touch. 
[03:59:30]  And my mother goes, you know what happened?  You had a nocturnally mission.  A what?  A nocturnally mission, you know.  And I said, no.  What are you, with the space program?  I'll tell you the first time I heard about masturbating.  It was from my friend Alan.  I was 13 years old.  I was at this kid's house.  And out of nowhere, he admits to me that he jacks off in his socks. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Look, girls are going, eh.  And the guys are like, yeah.  Sorry, girls.  We can't fuck a carrot.  He says he fucks his socks. 
[04:00:30]  And I'm thinking, I'm very open-minded.  I really am.  But, you know, how do you get in the mood to fuck your sock?  I mean, what are you on?  The bus on the way home from school going, hey, wait until I get you in bed later.  You're going to get it good, you Argyle, you.  Take it down to the heel, you sweat sock.  And you don't know me, but, you know, I'm very particular when it comes to sex, and I ain't 
[04:01:00]  fucking a sock I just took off my foot.  So that means I've got to go to the dresser to pick out a clean sock to fuck.  Forget it.  It's just too complicated.  Because you don't know me.  I'll be standing there going, hmm, do I want to fuck something dressy or something casual?  And, you know, do I got to wear a tie if I'm fucking the dress sock or? 
[04:01:30]  And then after you're done, you've got to throw the sock in the dirty clothes.  And, you know, and that's when it dawned on me, you know, when I was 13, that the washer  and dryer never eats your socks.  I got a friend that said, oh, God, you know, it's the dryer.  It must be eating my socks.  He's like, no, you only fucked one sock.  That's why there's only one sock in the dryer.  It's...  The other sock is in the dresser waiting to get fucked.
