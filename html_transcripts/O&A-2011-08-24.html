<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the recent East Coast earthquake.  The hosts recounted their experiences, with humorous anecdotes including one host initially dismissing the earthquake as his girlfriend's fabrication, and another feeling the subtle tremors in a soundproof booth only to discover the magnitude of the event outside.  Numerous crude jokes, including those referencing the earthquake, Casey Anthony, and Chris Benoit, were interspersed throughout.  The conversation shifted to the hosts' action figure collections, specifically one host's extensive wrestling figure collection that suffered minor damage.  This led to a lengthy discussion about collecting habits, the value of wrestling memorabilia, and online collecting communities.  A caller then phoned in, obsessed with wrestling memorabilia, relating anecdotes such as receiving a CM Punk whiskey-stained cowboy hat from JBL.  The caller's conversation also touched upon Mick Foley's upcoming stand-up performance and darkly comedic speculation about an encounter with him.  News reports and commentary from Dr. Michio Kaku regarding the earthquake were played, and the hosts jokingly mocked his apparent nervousness about earthquakes.  A significant portion of the show was then dedicated to a guest, Aaron Sheik, who launched into a profanity-laced rant against his father, boss, and Nashville County voters. This included repeated use of "fuck you" directed at various individuals and groups.  The show returned to the caller, detailing a humorous and concerning incident where he guided his girlfriend, via phone, through handling a shotgun after she reported hearing the doorbell. The discussion then briefly turned to the caller's IRS audit stemming from a fraudulently cashed lottery ticket and their strong, offensive opinions about Ron Paul, liberals, and conservative Christians.

The next segment featured Bill Burr as a guest.  The conversation focused on frustrations with large corporations, particularly banks and airlines, with the hosts and Burr sharing anecdotes about battling corporations over billing errors and other issues, utilizing highly offensive language throughout. A lengthy discussion and viewing of a YouTube video showing a seemingly exploitative children's game show with inappropriate behavior from the host followed.  The conversation also included discussions about hunting wild boars and the evolution of air travel and flight attendants.

Mick Foley then joined the show.  The conversation started with a recap of a previous show where Ginger Lynn had an orgasm on Foley's knee, leading to a discussion about Foley's subsequent anti-bullying campaign appearance on OutQ Radio. The hosts and Foley joked about the knee incident, with Foley portraying himself as saving Ginger Lynn from their inappropriate suggestions.  The conversation then covered Foley's wrestling career, including stories about Superfly Jimmy Snuka and his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker.  They discussed Foley's *Celebrity Wife Swap* experience, his stand-up comedy career, his experiences with Judah Friedlander, and the challenges of transitioning from wrestling to stand-up, including anecdotes about bombing on stage and performing at a benefit show.  The segment included numerous off-color jokes about masturbation, suicide bombings, and Foley's past sexual experiences, along with discussions about flying and encounters with fellow passengers and flight attendants. Foley discussed his frugal nature and his children's reactions to it and promised to bring a special wrestling memorabilia item for Sam on a future appearance.  He also promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.

In a later segment with Mick Foley, the conversation began with a discussion of his recent Carnegie Hall performance and his upcoming trip to Bangor, Maine and St. John, New Brunswick.  Foley detailed his preparation for an appearance at the Gathering of the Juggalos, including purchasing a rain slicker and a milk-filled water cannon. The conversation included discussion of other performers' experiences at the Gathering, including Charlie Sheen, and the challenges of performing at events with potentially hostile audiences, including the “Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.”  Anthony’s girlfriend’s possession of a loaded shotgun because of a perceived threat, Foley's charity auction where fans could bid to have him visit their home, his work with TNA wrestling and his future plans were also discussed. The segment concluded with listener calls and a humorous bit involving Foley and Ginger Lynn attempting a "knee orgasm" challenge.

[00:04:30]  warning warning warning warning warning 
[00:05:00]  Warning! Warning! Earthquake! Warning! Attention! Warning!  Earthquake! Warning! Warning! Warning!  Earthquake! Warning! Attention! Warning!  It may destroy blocks of ass!  It may destroy telephone poles! 
[00:05:30]  Attention!  Major earthquake!  Major earthquake! Warning!  He didn't have the state, but...  Boy, that tard knew what he was talking about!  Ah, good morning, everybody!  Good morning!  Earthquake! Warning!  Good...  Right.  Yeah, that's probably gonna be in my head now for a little while.  I know, that one will stick there. 
[00:06:00]  Ugh, like his tongue against a fucking cold pole on a winter day.  Or an electrical socket that's not being blocked properly.  Or any...  Paint chips.  That's that.  Ah, yeah.  Earthquake, I guess.  Was that the big story?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy, you can't get anybody that won't talk about that fucking thing.  I, uh...  I would love to be able to add my two cents in about the, uh, little shake... 
[00:06:30]  The shaking, shaky-wakey we got yesterday.  But I was sleeping.  I was asleep on the couch.  And felt nothing.  I called my chick a liar.  Because she was, uh, she was out back by the, uh, by the pool.  It was a wonderful day here in, uh, the New York area yesterday.  And, uh, she was back by the pool.  And she came in, she goes, what, did you feel that?  What's going on?  And I'm like, well, I was asleep, you know. 
[00:07:00]  And, uh, she goes, everything was shaking.  The, the...  She goes, all the tiki torches started, like, shaking back and forth in the yard.  And she goes, look, the chandelier's shaking.  So I look, and I was like, get out of here.  You pushed that.  I'm, I'm quite the skeptic.  Jesus.  I thought she was pulling a gag on me.  Her and the whole neighborhood got together?  Yes.  For moving your house?  Just for me.  Uh, yeah.  So I, uh, I, I didn't believe it at first.  But then I looked at the chandelier, the one that she couldn't reach. 
[00:07:30]  And that was shaking back and forth, too.  So, um, and I was like, oh, okay.  So I guess we had some kind of an earthquake.  Uh, and I gotta, I gotta refute something here.  That, um, uh, Ron Bennington said, uh, all reports that minutes after the earthquake happened,  I went out and shot all my neighbors.  Completely false.  Ron Bennington got on the show right after the, uh, the little shake and, uh, was reporting 
[00:08:00]  that I had already shot all of my neighbors.  False.  Didn't happen.  But you gotta love Bennington.  That's hilarious.  Panicking.  It's the end of the world.  I'm just shooting people.  But, uh, no, that didn't happen.  It didn't happen.  But like I said, I didn't feel anything.  I didn't either.  Iraq loved talking about how he felt, uh, in the, in the building here.  Described it as the building, uh, moving like it does in a high wind, only up and down  instead of side to side. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, you can feel it in here.  Yeah.  Iraq felt that.  Yes.  Iraq.  How about a comment on the earthquake?  Yes.  Iraq.  Did you enjoy the multitude of Iraq related earthquake jokes?  Of course.  Iraq fell.  Iraq took a step.  Iraq rolled out of bed.  Iraq's jump roping.  Iraq's doing jumping jacks.  Iraq did a sit up.  No, it just kept going and going.  I don't believe the sit up.  Yeah.  Who know him by that? 
[00:09:00]  Or jumping jacks.  Clumsily fell while grabbing cupcakes.  Yeah, there is a, but they just wouldn't stop though.  And, uh, it was, they were, they did get annoying.  Well, we did what, you know, whatever you're supposed to do on an earthquake.  Roland and I went down and got food and got some food, an earthquake food break.  What'd you get?  Um, we went down, there was a creeps truck right up front.  So we went out there and, uh, should have got into it because you're creeps.  The, uh, cause you're creeps. 
[00:09:30]  I guess this was based in Virginia, old Virginia.  And, uh, DC got pretty shaken up for the East coast.  You know, how long did it last?  How long did it last?  I think about 12 seconds.  Oh, wow.  I thought it was like two seconds, three seconds.  They said about 12 seconds.  And, uh, we were, I'm looking at a video here, raw video of the White House, uh, shaken by the earthquake.  And there's the guys on the roof, the, the, the post 9-11, holy shit.  We never had people on the roof guys and realized, wow, we better get up there with some stinger missiles. 
[00:10:00]  Uh, they started walking around, I guess, wondering what the hell was going on.  People in the capital and, uh, Pentagon and stuff freaking out.  Cause they, I guess they thought there was some kind of, uh, an attack again.  People in the Pentagon saying it felt like, like it did on 9-11.  They felt kind of an impact and a shaky thing.  There's the capital camera.  You see the camera shaking, but.  Yeah.  I don't see the building shaking.  I see the camera shaking.  Well, you, you definitely wouldn't be able to see the building shaking from that distance. 
[00:10:30]  If you saw the building shaking from about a quarter, half a mile away, that would be a hell of an earthquake.  You'd see that thing come down like, like motherfucking Independence Day, bitch.  Uh, some damage though, in, uh, in, in our capital.  I guess there is some damage to the church.  Uh, that big, uh, fucking touristy attraction church they got down there.  And, um, and, uh, the Washington Monument.  Oh.  Big needly thing.  They said some problem.  I don't know what it was, but, uh, some problem there. 
[00:11:00]  Looking at footage now of, uh, just a parking lot with one car is crushed.  What do you think a big, a girder fell on it or something?  Yeah, like a steel girder and some cinder blocks and rubble.  I would just call that all rubble.  Yeah.  That's a, that's a car is fucked.  Yeah.  That thing is fucked.  That guy's going to have problems with insurance.  I think.  Earthquake.  Why you?  No way.  Are they covered for earthquake?  You think, or no?  I would think so.  Right.  Natural disaster.  Maybe. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, people.  Wow.  What a big thing to talk about though.  Uh, Twitter.  Woof.  You gotta love the Twitter when you get a non event like that.  It's all right.  It was a five, nine magnitude, uh, earthquake, uh, East coast rarely happens.  I hear it's felt for quite a distance further than on the West coast earthquakes, because  our, our, um, sub structures and rocks are very densely packed together. 
[00:12:00]  Not like the West coast where they're all just willy nilly plates sitting around.  Um, I think the, the only, the only funny ish thing I read was a line that said, uh, on  Twitter and it said, uh, it lined, it lies on, uh, uh, Washington is on a fault line.  Bush's fault, which is kind of cute because you know, they blame everything on Bush.  But other than that, it was the same jokes, Iraq jokes or, or fat people joke. 
[00:12:30]  How many times did you see the lawn chair picture?  Yeah.  The lawn chair picture, which is funny.  The first time I saw it, gotta admit.  Yeah.  Hundredth time.  Hundredth time.  I just, cause then it would just be my name and a link.  And I just stopped clicking links without any explanation.  It was, uh, you see that one, the plastic outdoor backyard table for chairs and one chair  is just tipped over backwards.  And then there was things like, Oh, the humanity and we will rebuild like that.  That's the picture of the damage, the stark damage from the earthquake. 
[00:13:00]  It's one plastic outdoor chair tipped on its back.  That's funny though.  We'll rebuild.  It was hilarious the first time, but then people just, you know how they are people on  Twitter.  Oh, the humanity.  Never forget.  And at the date, it's just a plastic chair tipped over.  Uh, yeah.  Any, anyone have any, uh, thrilling earthquake stories?  I, um, I don't know.  It's got a, there's a big superimposed picture of an eagle with an American flag sort of see-through 
[00:13:30]  so you could see the table and one chair.  8-23-2011.  Never forget.  There's some funny people.  It is.  See, that's gotta put a little work into it.  That's pretty goddamn funny.  Is that an actual photo from someone's yard?  Yeah, I'm thinking they just did it to make a joke.  The first guy just did that and posted it and then other people kind of ran with the  balls.  Uh, pretty good though.  I was up here. 
[00:14:00]  Uh, Sam, please, uh, extol upon us your horrific earthquake story.  It was.  I'll never forget.  Casey Anthony's on TV.  Oh.  Oh my god.  Big titted fucking baby killing monster.  She has a big forehead though.  I don't care.  Me neither.  Ugh.  Yeah.  No, never.  Uh, I was in, uh, one of the booths recording.  Yes.  So you're in a booth.  Right, it's soundproof.  Now that's claustrophobic as it is.  Yeah.  So this must have really gotten you.  It was.  I looked up at one point. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  I was looking at my notebook and then I looked up at the computer monitor.  Uh huh.  And it seemed like the picture on the monitor was bouncing up and down a little bit.  Whoa.  And I figure, oh, maybe I'm dizzy or there's something wrong with this monitor.  How great is that you thought you were having a fucking stroke?  Yeah.  Brain tumor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then it, then it stopped shaking.  So I said, oh, I'll just continue.  And I was in there for another 10 minutes.  Yeah.  And, uh, the monitor was fine after that.  And then I came out of the soundproof booth and everybody was panicking. 
[00:15:00]  And the radios around here were all blasting the news feed.  The news.  And they're talking about the Pentagon being evacuated.  And I was like, what did I miss?  What happened?  They're like, there was an earthquake.  And I said, no, I was in there.  There was no earthquake.  The monitor showed.  And then I realized.  Is that the monitor showed?  Wow.  And then I got home.  Yeah.  And I looked at my shelf.  Uh huh.  And two of my action figures.  Yes.  Yes.  Were face down.  Face down.  Where they were standing the morning that I had left.  Which, by the way, you did take a picture of and post. 
[00:15:30]  Uh, and people, uh, the sympathy you got for that.  Just amazing.  Well, it really does show you that there is a touching side to the fans of this show.  And that when there is a tragedy.  People pull together.  Yeah, they do pull together.  There is a two of your action figures.  Could you please tell us who those action figures are?  Well, that's Ted DiBiase Jr. and Christian on the ground after the damage that was left on my shelf.  I mean, thank God Yoshi Tatsu is still standing there in the green. 
[00:16:00]  Where do you have those set up like that?  They're in my apartment.  But where in your apartment is that awful shelf?  In the living room.  You fucking chick allows that?  It's the wrestling shelf.  Little toys.  There's a picture of me and Triple H on top and my championship belt on the bottom.  Thank God nothing happened to those.  Sam, will you rebuild?  I don't know if I'm going to be able to.  Yeah.  I may start some kind of PayPal account.  Yeah, yeah.  That I could help. 
[00:16:30]  But I will try to rebuild.  I was also...  There's the courage to be able to rebuild knowing that the threat of an earthquake is  there and perhaps more action figures will fall over in the future.  Exactly.  Uh, that's, you know, that's ballsy move.  Although a couple people on Twitter accused Seamus, who's standing there with the lead pipe,  of knocking the other two out while it was gone.  Well, no one was there to see it.  The ref had his back turned, so you don't know it could have been Seamus with the pipe.  You are a fucking baby.  Really?  It's just... 
[00:17:00]  That's an awful shelf.  That's terrible.  I'd rather have a shelf of spam.  I'd rather have a shelf of shit.  Just lumps of shit up there.  We're losing sight of the real damage and story behind this picture.  That's true.  Is that we were all affected by the East Coast earthquake yesterday.  Ah.  I'm trying to think, as you're talking about your tale, I'm thinking, how could I structure  a story around that for a film?  Yeah.  That's an amazing story.  I mean, it's no Crepes story, but it is, you know, we all were affected differently.  Travis, are you okay?  Yeah, I was in the subway. 
[00:17:30]  Travis.  I had no idea what happened.  Wow, that's like an action movie.  Yeah, exactly.  If you were in the subway.  You came out and everything was different.  It's a different world.  Damn.  It's a post...  Earthquake world when you come out.  I came out from underground and I usually sleep on the subway.  Yeah.  So I wake up and I...  Sure, why should it be any different than here?  Yeah.  I check my Twitter feed and it's just, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake.  And then my chick texts me and she's like, yeah, there was an earthquake. 
[00:18:00]  Oh.  And I guess it was a little worse where we are because we live...  Of course it was because it's worse where everyone is.  It's always worse where you are.  Where you are.  Yeah, yeah.  Where you personally are.  We live out on Rockaway, which is like a four block peninsula.  And it rocks away.  Like Rockaway would probably...  You alright?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just had an earthquake pour out of my mouth.  Nothing's bomb.  I had a pencil insula once.  So, um... 
[00:18:30]  You're in Rockaway, right?  Well, I wasn't.  My wife was.  Oh, right, right.  Your wife was, yeah.  But it was bad enough that...  Or it was long enough that she had time to figure out what was going on and wake up our  daughter and stand in like the middle...  No, she did not stand in a doorway or a...  From what I get, it was like a minute over there.  What?  As opposed to like 15 seconds over here.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe it's different where it's a peninsula and you're like...  We're like right on the water.  No, you guys are right on the water.  Was there fear of tsunami?  Now you, being on the water, there's a fear there, right? 
[00:19:00]  Not from me, but I may have read on Facebook some other people that live in the area were  fearing aftershocks and tsunamis.  Really?  More retarded people that live in the area.  Well, that's what this film that we're working on is going to be all about the different  experiences.  I feel like, for me, it's sort of the rebuilding process.  For Travis, it's the action-adventure sort of thing.  Yeah.  Eric and Roland, the harrowing tale of having to get down to the bottom floor of the building  for crepes. 
[00:19:30]  Of course.  Hopefully the crepes in the truck hadn't spilled on the floor.  Exactly.  Making their trip.  Exactly.  Null and Voight, right.  And my fiance was at work, so thank God she didn't have to see the damage firsthand.  I was able to brace her before she came in the door.  Yeah, because that's something that stays with you.  Yeah.  You know, you can't unsee two action figures.  I'll bet you she knocked them over before she went to work and there happened to be an  earthquake.  She just looked at that dumb display and went, ugh.  I'll bet you every morning before she goes, she fucking flicks one with her finger. 
[00:20:00]  Fucking asshole.  Or she just kicks the side of the shelf.  Yeah.  I bet you there's been plenty of times where all of them were knocked over and she's like,  ugh, I just don't want to hear his mouth.  Without the coincidence of the earthquake, you didn't even give it a second thought,  just set him back up, going like, hmm, eh, must have been something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Loose articulation in the ankles.  Yeah.  It's just, you are so immature.  It's adorable.  Wow.  Where's Mick Foley?  That's the SmackDown shelf, so Mick Foley's not going to. 
[00:20:30]  How many shelves do you have?  Wait, wait, wait, what?  You have them segregated?  Obviously.  Obviously.  And there were people who noticed, you see Cody Rhodes there wearing the championship belt.  I don't know who that is.  I'm saying, now you do.  Fuck that.  Looks like some guy named Dom.  But he is the current champion, so people on Twitter noticed that I changed the belt.  Oh, you changed the belt?  As the titles change in life.  Who's the champion?  Wow.  That would let us know that that is an accurate time-wise picture. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I couldn't have predicted that.  So you don't put The Rock in there.  Is The Rock in there?  The Rock's a shelf below on the Legends shelf.  Yeah.  How many shelves do you have?  Yeah.  It's a tall bookshelf, so there's like five shelves on the shelf.  Mm-hmm.  And you have wrestling figures and everything.  How do they get?  They get dusty, right?  Dusty Rhodes.  Dusty Rhodes is there, yes.  Where's that?  Under the fucking questionable preference shelf? 
[00:21:30]  I mean, yeah, they get dusty.  If it gets bad, I'll use one of the whatever Swiffer things.  What?  What are you, the help?  Get a fucking little air thing and blow the air thing down there.  Do you know the air thing that you clean your computer dust with?  Yeah.  Your computer keyboard.  Those you should use.  I find Swiffer does a better job.  How does he work with a Swiffer?  You know, you just use the cloth.  What are you...  A duster.  Oh, fucking...  A cloth on the fucking thing.  They probably all fall over.  Then you gotta pick them up, each one individually. 
[00:22:00]  Well, the air thing...  To have weakly articulated ankles.  Exactly.  The air thing would probably knock some of them over.  Oh, would you love my glass display that I have in my apartment?  I have a glass display thing, which I was just...  It shouldn't.  I spent way too much money on years ago.  Oh, he would love that, right?  Put them all in there.  Yeah, it's fucking perfect for what you have.  I know.  I've seen it.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  But then the earthquake probably would've, like, shaken that, and they all would've fallen  over.  And then it would've had to go into the glass shelves.  Oh, the disaster.  That would've been...  Wow. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, my God.  Don't even speak of it.  Wow.  Does she like the shelves?  She doesn't mind...  Oh.  She'd probably rather put anything there.  Just books about clitoral circumcision.  Anything more enjoyable to look at than these figures.  Well, she prefers that there's one shelving unit as opposed to figures everywhere.  Just...  Would you put them everywhere if you could?  I already do, like, extend it out.  Like, Akeem the African Dream and Macho Man Randy Savage stand next to the television.  Why?  Why?  Because I like them.  And they stand next to the TV. 
[00:23:00]  And you could see them while you're watching television.  Yeah.  You could glance over and be like, those are my favorites.  I like those guys.  Right now, maybe they'll change positions.  Oh, holy shit.  Are these all the same size?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're all to scale.  It's all the same figure, right?  I mean, the same series.  No, no, no.  Yeah, it's the same series.  It's all Mattel.  Well, how tall is each one?  Yeah, that would be stupid, Jimmy, to have different ones.  I don't mix.  I remember years ago, I used to collect dolls like this.  Dolls?  Well, we got dolls.  We'll go action figures.  No, no, no.  Action, not doing anything.  And we'll go dolls.  Lack of action. 
[00:23:30]  Exactly.  They fall down when fucking...  There's a little shake.  They're atrophied figures.  That's all they do.  But I had, like, the Thing and the Fantastic Four, and this is in the 70s.  But then they made bigger Hulk dolls, and I hated the bigger ones because it didn't match.  Of course.  It doesn't make any sense anymore.  I mean, the Big Show, of course, is going to be about a seven-inch figure, but your average  figure would be about six inches.  Are they a scale to each other?  Yes.  Like, is the Big Show bigger than the rest of these action figures?  Oh, yeah.  They're to scale.  Oh, well, that's interesting.  Mattel does a great job. 
[00:24:00]  That's interesting, because then they can't just mold all the body parts for one thing and  then just pop different heads on them.  Right.  I mean, they do share some of the...  Shut up.  I don't care.  Okay.  I like the arms on this one are exactly the same as the arms on that one.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Yeah, they do share.  Who's the guy in the red shorts over there?  Uh, that's Tyson Kidd.  I don't know who any of these guys are.  I know.  Where's fucking Ivan Putzky?  They don't have an Ivan Putzky.  Yet.  I mean, maybe he'll come out...  Why not in the Legends?  Why not George Animal Steel into Legends?  I have a George Animal Steel. 
[00:24:30]  He's a shelf below.  Why wouldn't you?  Who else is there?  There's four or five shelves worth.  I've never wanted to knock shelves over containing anything as badly.  You should clean the dust off of them with a shotgun.  Yeah.  There were a few...  Fun thing to do.  How do I repair this?  Uh, there were some that said with a blow torch.  There were some that said with a shotgun.  Though they weren't being helpful, but for the majority of people were sensitive.  Um, I don't think kids would buy an Ivan Putzky figure.  You're probably right.  But it's not all about the money, is it?  When you're making real legends, you gotta make real legends. 
[00:25:00]  It's true.  There is some integrity to the line.  Right.  And kids don't buy this either.  It's fucking adults.  That's right.  E-Rock, would you own any of these?  Would he?  Would he?  I own a couple.  Would he?  Not to the scale that Sam does though.  You don't own nearly as many?  No.  Nowhere near.  Does E-Rock know a lot about wrestling?  I mean, he knows...  Like, he's a wrestling fan, yes.  But I mean...  I'm not as in-depth or intense as Sam is.  I think Sam's a little OCD.  I think Sam's a little OCD.  And I get it.  I'm the same with other stuff. 
[00:25:30]  But I think Sam's a bit OCD with this collection.  Well, there was one...  Like, when I got...  I used to, when I was a kid, buy every single figure.  Like, repaints every single one.  Okay.  At some point when I got older, and it's still difficult to this day, had to say one of  each guy that is made.  So I don't need to get every Undertaker.  I have an Undertaker.  So was it like Toy Story 3?  I didn't see Toy Story 3.  You gave your little dolls away?  No, no.  I didn't give them away.  What'd you do?  They're in my parents' house. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, they're literally closets and closets and closets full.  I'm talking about closets.  Sometimes something like this you could probably make some kind of...  I don't know who would give a fuck.  But it'd be a cool display if you could set it up.  But then again, there's probably people that have more stuff than you, right?  Like, dolls and stuff?  I mean, action figures, dolls, a whole bunch of stuff.  But...  Yeah, there has to be people who have larger collections than me.  But I have a fairly extensive wrestling...  But you still...  And you buy, like, all the dolls.  Like, you buy...  Like, these people are...  They're...  Well, I buy current action figures, yeah.  They're nobodies. 
[00:26:30]  They're going to...  Well, no.  Yoshi Tatsu.  Maybe Sheamus is a main event guy.  Oh, there are any other...  I know, but this kid...  This kid guy?  Like, you don't need that doll.  Look at the action figure positioning.  You see how he's towards the back of the shelf?  Yeah.  The main event guys are gonna be at the front.  Are there any dolls you don't have that you want to buy?  Well, there's...  Dolls.  Doll.  Doll.  What?  That you don't have?  Yet.  I mean, and they keep making them.  What's the next doll purchase you'll make?  Well, I am looking for a Bam Bam Bigelow action figure from the Legends line. 
[00:27:00]  Bam Bam Bigelow.  Yeah.  How much do these dolls run?  The action figures...  The current ones are like $12, $13, $14.  That's not bad.  Alright.  And the Legends are a little more expensive.  You're talking $17, $18.  Do you...  Now, let me...  This would actually be a cool...  As much as I want to smash Sam, I do get this.  I get it.  I completely get it.  That would be cool if you had a...  In a garbage can?  How great would they be with fucking just garbage juice and pigeon shit? 
[00:27:30]  I'd be pissed.  Scraped out macaroni that you didn't eat, just laying on their faces.  Fucking meatloaf.  Come on, Jess.  Man up already.  Get rid of this shit.  I'd be super pissed.  But if you had a basement, like a house with a basement...  Yeah.  And you could get like a wall display where they were along the wall in kind of a glass  display case.  That's right.  I've always wanted to do that because I have all the collections from when I was younger.  We all have our dreams.  Yeah.  That's not my dream.  It's just something... 
[00:28:00]  Would you like to buy some of the repaints?  Yeah.  I mean, if I had the money, I would buy more.  What is...  Why don't you just not buy these dolls and then just buy the ones that you really want?  The action figures that I buy are the ones that have the priority, of course.  What is...  Maybe we can go on eBay or something.  I'm curious as to what is the...  Like, I don't remember where those dolls that I had when I was a kid are, but I still  love them.  I remember the packaging they came in, those little Marvel Comics ones.  Yeah.  If you're kind of OCD, it's like...  Yeah.  You know, you have to have them all.  Yeah.  What is the fucking get for a wrestling doll? 
[00:28:30]  All right.  Well, I just eBayed wrestling doll.  Well, you're not going to get...  Try action figures.  Action figures, the better result finder.  Oh.  There you go.  Hulk Hogan talking wrestling doll.  I have that.  Of course.  I don't think it talks anymore, but I have it.  Go to her price.  Thank God.  I wish the real Hulk was like that.  Yeah.  It doesn't talk anymore.  The Hulkster and Heaven doll.  It's a little box with a fucking tear on it.  A little fucking dopey kid.  Yeah.  There's just one empty seat with a W, because it's Wembley.  Wembley.  In Wembley. 
[00:29:00]  374 wrestling figure collection with free bonuses.  $1,300.  That's a starting bid.  That's a starting bid.  Nobody's bid on it, though.  Wow.  Is that the most expensive one?  No, there's a single...  Oh, wow.  That's a whole Hasbro collection.  I have...  I think I have every single one.  I have a lot of those.  Oh, boy.  Are they hard to get?  Some of them are.  Some of them not.  Those are probably harder when they're in the box.  But at least you take them out of the box.  Yeah.  You're not just collecting them to sell.  I got bad, though, when I was like 13 or 14.  For about a year, I bought two of every single figure that came out. 
[00:29:30]  One in the...  Yeah.  Two in the box.  Two in the box.  I have, like, boxes at home of...  That's why you don't eat certain foods, and that's why you have a sickness from being  overly mothers.  I'm surprised that's the only box you don't get into, or do get into.  Shit.  Is this worth $1,500?  I mean, I don't have any of the Rockin' Wrestling series.  Would you want them?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I don't have them.  I mean, Rockin' Wrestling is like the cartoon.  Wow.  And so they look more cartoony.  I don't have any of the Rockin' Wrestling series. 
[00:30:00]  The box in the box is in perfect condition.  What is...  I think with Star Wars ones, too...  Oh, yeah.  I think with the original Star Wars, which we all had, the...  What were the sand ones?  I believe it.  Sand people.  Yeah, I think that was the sand people.  The little guy is the fucking...  The hardest one to get in the box.  Oh, the Jawas?  The Jawas.  The Jawas, they call it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The ones that were...  With the hoods?  Yeah, it's one of them in the box. 
[00:30:30]  Are you...  I saw a Star Wars poster.  I forget how much an original art poster for thousands of fucking dollars.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  For like...  There you go.  One sold for $910.  $910?  That's loose, though.  I thought they were even more than that.  That's loose.  In the box there.  $750.  Oh.  But they're graded, too, so like...  Yes.  Like everything's...  Jammin' tan!  They do that for everything now.  Are these the small...  Oh, yeah, 1978.  Um, unpunch.  What's that mean?  There's probably not a hole punch, I'm assuming.  Oh, okay.  We're selling faggy wrestling dolls. 
[00:31:00]  We're not.  Faggy wrestling dolls for any faggot that wants one.  What's ironic is that is what Don West is selling now.  Is he doing that now?  Yes.  I don't buy the TNA figure.  Look at this doll.  Let's open it up.  Check it out.  It's another unknown wrestler.  Another has-been.  Is that what he's doing?  Is that what he's doing?  He's not in those words, but...  Well...  Yeah, he is selling TNA action figures.  Like, and selling them like that. 
[00:31:30]  Who are some of the people in TNA?  Well, Mick Foley was.  He's gone now.  Ah.  Hulk Hogan has TNA figure.  Oh, well.  Jeff Hardy's there.  Why don't you get these?  The Hardy boys.  Kurt Angle, Rob Van Damme.  The TNA guys?  That's...  You gotta cut the line someplace.  Now it's...  And that's where you drew the line in the sand?  There was a time when I would have gotten the TNA guys because I needed every wrestling  figure, but I don't get anything from TNA.  I should buy them because I would like to buy them just to break them in front of Sam.  Oh, yeah.  Upset me. 
[00:32:00]  Why would you just give them to me?  I don't know.  Big Boss Man comes with an exploding heart.  Oh, jeez.  His heart explodes!  Quite the action figure, though, depending on how fair you like y'are.  They could have a whole line of exploding heart dolls.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  I did just get the British Bulldog.  The British Bulldog!  His heart explodes, too!  Be dialing, people! 
[00:32:30]  Be dialing!  911 for the action figure!  I had to get two more by the end of the month.  Comes with a flatline EKG!  I had to buy two more from Toys R Us by the end of the month because they're doing a deal  where if you buy four and you send the UPCs in, you get a free Vince McMahon.  Oh, wow.  Mattel has not made a Vince McMahon, and so far I've bought six, so I need two more so I 
[00:33:00]  can get two and leave one, of course, package.  Oh, you still do that?  Well, just for the special ones.  It's not going to be worth anything.  I like the special ones.  I would like to have one in the box.  What piece of wrestling paraphernalia would you like to have that you've seen?  Because your chair is pretty cool.  That's signed by all those people.  Right.  I would like...  I don't have anything, I don't think.  Ring-used wrestling gear.  Like tights, boots.  Oh, okay.  Of course.  Things like that.  That's what I would really like to have.  Those are hard to get.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Get the Macho Man and a Bronco!  Macho Man and a Bronco whiskey bottle included in this one, people!  Trees sold separately?  Trees sold separately!  Trees sold separately!  But we're going to throw it in if you buy it on FlexPay!  I have that old Vince McMahon.  That's sold for $125.  Oh, I don't have it packaged.  That's the old LJN Vince McMahon.  Maniacal Chris Benoit!  Maniacal Chris Benoit!  Maniacal Chris Benoit! 
[00:34:00]  And his dead family!  And his dead family!  And his dead...  Buy it now, people!  This isn't going to last just like his family!  Three-pack?  It's a three-pack!  Still in the box!  The wooden ones that they were buried in!  Bedailing the SWAT team!  It's horrible!  Terrible!  Say something like that!  She's trying to talk about the damage from the earthquake! 
[00:34:30]  I didn't think we were going to get into Chris Benoit's family!  Well, you know, it's tragedy!  Tragedy!  We're doing a tragedy break!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I would need, though, I mean, a giant...  If I actually wanted to display everything I have, including the figures,  I mean, I'd need a humongous basement!  Why would you put them in the basement?  Prominently displayed!  That's a cool place to put them!  Prominently displayed!  There will one day be a Sam Roberts house with a Sam Roberts man cave,  and by man cave, I mean a room where I put... 
[00:35:00]  Your asshole!  No!  No!  I would love that if somebody broke into your house with a gun,  and, like, in Livy and the marathon man,  you could only keep the action figures that you could swallow  or shove in your asshole!  And then he could keep the whole collection!  Exactly!  Jess would also start to ask for some of her stuff!  Like, I don't know there's so much room in there!  Can you bring my shoes?  Get the Pat Patterson and the ring boy doll! 
[00:35:30]  With working genitalia!  Articulated genitalia!  And look, his hand fits right on the ass and locks in!  Locks in!  Locks into his ass!  Pat Patterson!  Pat Patterson!  Pat Patterson!  Pat Patterson!  With Articulated Penis!  It should become a rank!  What?  I would buy some of those if they were advertised like that! 
[00:36:00]  Poor taste wrestling action figures!  Yes!  Yes!  That's great!  Now, Jess cannot like this!  As a beautiful young woman, she likes...  She seems to like the better things in life!  Yes, she does, but what I...  She doesn't mind it!  Like, she likes that I have passions!  Yeah!  And I also try to point out action figures of things that she likes!  Yeah!  For instance, she always liked Twilight Zone growing up! 
[00:36:30]  Uh-huh!  So I go, oh, look how cool this action figure is!  And she'll feign interest, but, you know...  It's not her thing!  She doesn't care about it!  I wish...  I envy people who don't like that stuff!  Like, I love it!  As much as I...  I get it!  I wish I didn't get it!  I wish I was like, you're cunt!  Yeah!  Just things!  Yeah!  All the time, I wish I could just clear everything out of the apartment and just get rid of everything  I own!  But there's no way I can get rid of this stuff!  Do you know how many people have seen my stuff and just go, oh, it's like a museum  in here!  Yeah! 
[00:37:00]  I frame everything and it has to be...  It takes the fun out of life!  Like, I obsess over nothing!  It's stupid!  But once it's all up there, it's nice to have, right?  Yeah, I guess so!  Because I got into that movie poster thing!  Now I'm like, fully, fully...  But you have a finished basement with a movie theater in it!  And maybe six or seven posters!  Tastefully done!  Ange picked out...  Of course I fucking saw the frames that Ange picked out!  Oh, that's so nice!  And now I wanna burn my own apartment to the ground!  I gotta go buy frames!  The museum!  The museum glass!  No glare or anything!  I go with that stuff, of course!  Fantastic! 
[00:37:30]  You've gotta...  Yeah, the frames are beautiful that she picked out for him!  What are we on?  Amali!  If posters were like what I was into, the wall would be covered in frames and posters!  Like, you wouldn't see a wall!  Oh!  It would just be posters!  And that's not tastefully done!  I always liked that as a kid with my kiss stuff, and I was always jealous of my friend  James, because his mother let him put on the ceiling in his room, so his ceiling and walls  were covered, but my parents would never let me touch the ceiling!  Like, once in a while I'd start doing the ceiling, just until they told me to take shit  down!  I'm obviously jealous when I see people with better, with wrestling collections that have 
[00:38:00]  stuff that I don't have!  Like, who's won or what have you seen that's one that you really liked that you didn't  know?  Well, this is a good one!  You're not gonna believe the deal we got!  It's the masturbating cuckold Hulk Hogan with his wife with double penetration action!  DP action!  Masturbating cuckold Hulk Hogan action figure doll!  Is there a Brutus the Barber Beefcake Hulk Hogan 2 pack?  Brutus the Barber Beefcake Hulk Hogan double dog dildo pack! 
[00:38:30]  Let's pull the dildo out and look!  I'm gonna open this package up!  Think of the fun!  It's just stuff that's in better condition than I have it, because my stuff is old from  when I was a kid, and so some of it is played with, because I played with stuff when I was  old, and they have the old stuff.  So the paint where the ass cheeks are is all worn off?  Those aren't the moves I did. 
[00:39:00]  Oh!  Speed dialing!  Speed dialing!  They got the, uh, Sergeant Slaughtered Speed Dialing, because he slaughtered everybody!  What?  Uh...  Yeah, that's, uh, oh, wow, that would be a good one!  Be dialing now for the Owen Hart action figure!  Owen Hart action figure!  Owen Hart action figure!  Owen Hart action figure!  Owen Hart action figure!  With, uh, it includes gravity! 
[00:39:30]  With splatting action figure!  With splatting action figure!  Gravity included!  With prolapsing asshole from hitting the canvas!  It's the Iron Sheik Water Pistol!  It's the Iron Sheik Water Pistol!  Iron Sheik Water Pistol!  Pisses right through his penis!  It's amazing!  Be dialing, people!  Be man! 
[00:40:00]  Pisses through his penis!  Because he pisses himself, get it?  Oh, God, that's, uh...  That's fucking hilarious, man!  That's wonderful!  Jesus is funny!  I'm glad most of your action figures, uh, figures, uh, pulled through!  Yes, I mean...  Pulled through from the big earthquake!  Where have you seen better collections?  Online!  I go to wrestling figure message boards and look at their pictures!  There's wrestling figure message boards?  Yes, absolutely!  Why would you go there?  Where they all come from asshole.com? 
[00:40:30]  There's so many smut sites, why go anywhere else?  Exactly!  God!  There's a big wrestling action figure message board that I'm on all the time.  I don't post.  Do they know you on there?  Oh, no.  Is it wfigs.proboard?  That's it.  Yep.  It's kind of like the one you go to, Ant.  No, it's a little different.  Where should I go?  If you scroll down, wrestling figure talk, Mattel.  Okay.  That's where I hang out.  Nine viewing.  This should be called, like, Figumania.  This is pretty cool.  You think so? 
[00:41:00]  See, like, that's a great topic.  Will we see a Kevin Nash anytime soon?  I don't know.  I can't think...  I can't think of a link I would click on in fucking...  Less want to click on than that.  Right.  Fucked baby photos I would click on before that.  Click...  I would bookmark them if you need the address.  This site fucking stinks.  This site fucking stinks.  Well, see, they post pictures of stuff that's coming out. 
[00:41:30]  That's where all the news breaks.  Then people post pictures of their collections.  People...  Why don't you show your shit collection?  I'm not gonna...  Why not?  Your fucking awful wooden shelf collection that you built.  Nothing wrong with my...  Stinks.  I didn't build the shelf.  Collection's fucking horrendous.  Does your mother have a message board for Sam collectibles that nobody's on to her?  I have his hair.  I have his teeth.  Taking pictures of my Boy Scout uniform.  Yeah.  Click on WrestleMania 27 figs right there. 
[00:42:00]  How long ago was it 27?  That was last year.  Oh, big deal.  It's new.  No, I just wanted to see if there were any pictures up.  That was just for my own.  Now, what's a collection?  You've seen one on here that you were jealous of?  Yeah, I can't...  I don't remember a username, but if you just scroll around on that board, uh, you'll  find people just post pictures of their collections, and sometimes they're really good.  Sometimes they're horrible, and I, you know...  Like, we've been looking at, yes.  No.  My collection is not horrible, and that was just a small segment of it.  That was just to display the earthquake damage to my collection. 
[00:42:30]  Heartbroken Jerry the King Lawler!  With genuine crying action!  What a pussy!  And his chick that fucks everybody!  Now it's just getting personal!  This guy has a lot of CM Punk action figures.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  See, I'm a little jealous of that, because when the last company was making figures, I  had a CM Punk collection as well, and I didn't maintain it into the Mattel line. 
[00:43:00]  CM Punk?  I just bought one of...  The fuck is it CM Punk?  CM Punk!  I've never seen anything more bowlable into it.  Would you love to take a nice 16 pounder and just roll it right into it?  Holy shit!  I would love to.  After hours were spent setting it up properly.  CM Punk is one of my favorites.  I don't know what CM Punk is.  He's a wrestler.  He's a big time wrestler.  There he is.  That's him.  He looks fruity in the eyes.  He's not fruity.  He's very...  He's very good at what he does.  He looks like an MMA fighter, actually, with his tattoos. 
[00:43:30]  He's very good at what he does, and he's bringing something cool back to wrestling.  Check out the Jim Ross doll we have!  Pull the string!  It talks as its mouth droops from the Bell's Palsy!  It's one of the only Bell's Palsy action figures ever made, people!  Be dirty!  Be dirty!  Bell's Palsy rules!  Hey, numb face! 
[00:44:00]  Be dirty!  Special drooling action!  Oh, you're funny, dude.  I love that shit, dude.  I love that shit, dude.  Oh, there's one I'm excited about.  Macho King MOC pic.  Oh, you're funny.  Right there.  That's...  Oh, good God.  This is the one I'm looking forward to a lot.  Ah, the Macho King Randy Savage.  Ah, Macho King. 
[00:44:30]  That's him with the crown.  I saw it at Comic-Con displayed, so...  Wow.  Let's see...  I want to see old action figures.  Show me a really old one.  Snap into an oak tree!  If you just Google image Hasbro or LJN WWF, you'll find it.  Ugh, this...  Every time we click back on that fucking awful shelf collection, it's just...  I hate it!  Just standing there on that fucking homemade woodshop shelf.  That's humiliating for them.  What are those figures?  They look a little caricature-ish.  Those are the Hasbros.  Those are from when, like, Travis and me were growing up. 
[00:45:00]  Just after the LJN.  Jake the Snake Roberts.  I see that.  Jake the Snake Roberts.  A little trivia for you, Anthony.  Yes, yes, please.  Jake Roberts was my first wrestling action figure.  Wow!  That's right.  Are these worth money?  Uh...  Some of them are.  Of course they're not.  They're shit.  Andre the Giant is worth money.  I would say the Big Boss Man ones, uh...  Well, the Big Boss Man's in a box.  But, uh...  That's not the floating heart.  Now, are the dead ones more valuable than the living wrestlers?  Not always.  No. 
[00:45:30]  No?  No.  It has more to do with the figure than the wrestler.  Now, what is the...  Let me ask you.  What is the most valuable wrestling figure?  Like, with comic books, people could say, well, it's Action Comics number one, or it's  with baseball cards, it's the Honus Wagner.  What is the fucking Honus Wagner of this?  Uh...  I don't know if there is one per se, but like, in this line, the Andre is pretty rare.  In the box, it's probably like...  You could probably get one for like $90.  That's it?!  Yeah, it's not...  I mean...  What?  It came out in like, 1989, so it's not like it's that old. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, the thing about these figures is that there's so many of them.  Right, and they're mass-produced.  Yeah, in the box, they're probably worth a little more, but like, everybody had these.  Yeah.  Okay, so what is one that wasn't mass-produced?  Like a fucking old Dusty Road or a magazine or something?  What's an old wrestling thing that's really worth money?  Well, I mean, it would probably be like ring-used gear goes for a lot of money.  Is there anybody on the phone that knows any of this?  Ring-used gear.  Ring-used gear.  Oh, I know, of course.  But is there anybody who actually is a collector that knows?  I don't know.  Jim's saying you don't know anything about wrestling.  Let's get somebody on the phone. 
[00:46:30]  I know lots about wrestling.  You do, but you don't know anything about the action figure value.  You're just pointing at your heroes and going, yay.  Fucking such.  Well, they're not like...  There is no super, like, $1,000 action figure.  You're saying there's no one that you're looking for.  Right, and the Star Wars one is that little guy.  I don't know why I'm interested in this.  Like, there's not a huge...  Because collectibles are cool.  Yeah, they are.  They all collect things.  But they're not...  It's funny, like, since...  Maybe 89 or it started.  But baseball cards from before then, before people knew.  But then after that, everybody knew to save them.  Everyone knew to save them.  They pumped out a fuckload under different names. 
[00:47:00]  And they would make them, like, $400 of meat.  Like, these shitty Don Russ fucking cards or all these...  It's like, nobody...  What are you doing?  Those are the ones, Don West was really hawking a lot of those, man.  Yeah, Don Russ.  Yeah, he'd sell, like, a box of the fucking things.  A million cards!  I'm looking at their value list now.  For a while.  Oh, yeah.  Baseball cards took a...  They took a major dive.  Big shit.  Baseball cards from, like, the 80s.  Like, Frank Thomas.  Or the 90s.  All the ones that were, like, expensive for a little while.  Yeah.  Once it started being, you know, like, yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Like, tops, uh, special, you know, edition.  Tops this.  Don Russ upper deck.  Once there was, like, you know, 20 different cards...  Flooded the market.  Yeah.  Stuff from the 80s and before is still worth money.  In the 70s, yeah.  Even though you said I'm before and I had to end the 70s.  Yeah, because that would be before.  We got it.  A blue blazer figure came out right after Owen Hart died.  Like, it was already in the shipping process, so they couldn't stop it from coming out.  And when that figure came out, it was worth hundreds of dollars.  Is it still out? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, but now it's not, it's not worth close to what it was worth.  Just like the Joker figure from The Dark Knight when, right after Heath Ledger died.  Right.  They pulled that figure.  Right.  They pulled it?  Yeah.  Is it back out now?  I don't think so.  It did.  Yeah, it came back out.  I found one and now it's not worth much.  Jesse the body Ventura doll.  With dandelion-like hair.  You blow it, it just falls out.  It's amazing.  Good fun, people, for the kids.  Dandelion.  Dandelion hair. 
[00:48:30]  Just give it a little puff and watch it fall out of his head.  Riff raff hairdo, as per Jim Norton.  If I sold everything, I could get a lot of money for it.  But that's because I have a lot of stuff.  Yeah, that includes your chick in your apartment.  Then you could get a lot of money.  If I sold my whole collection.  I've been watching this show about collectors now.  You know, it's like the hoarder-collector thing.  And a lot of these collectors are like organized hoarders.  And I saw the one with the woman with the shoes. 
[00:49:00]  I saw two, yes!  Okay.  Here's the deal.  This woman has fucking umpteen thousands of shoes.  What shows us?  I'll try and find it.  It's a...  TLC...  Collect...  Something with collectors.  It's on TLC.  Collect...  Colle...  Colle...  Colle...  What the fuck is it called?  Someone will get it up here.  Within seconds.  Ah, they're proud. 
[00:49:30]  There's also a kid collecting vacuum cleaners.  Yeah, the kid that collected vacuums was just a weirdo.  The woman was the best, though, with the shoes.  The little...  It was all...  It was miniature shoes, though.  She had miniature shoes, and then full-size ones.  And anything that was shaped like a shoe, this fucking dumb bitch would buy.  Well, she...  Collection obsession.  I do get hoarding for that reason.  Like, but there is a fine line between collecting and hoarding.  They're absolutely...  Yes.  And the collection obsession one, she had these shoes, and then she had an appraiser come  in because she wanted to have the collection appraised so she could get a bank loan for 
[00:50:00]  like three-quarters of a million dollars to open up a shoe store kind of a thing.  I think...  For her collection.  I think she wanted a $700,000 loan.  $700,000?  Oh, did I say three-quarters of a million dollars?  I meant...  I'm stupid.  Gee.  I thought you said one for it.  No, that's an excellent distinction to make.  Go ahead.  How much was it, Sam?  A million minus $250?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:50:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:51:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  a boo  a boo  and she  the guy was like yeah if that was a real Tiffany  it would be worth you know $250,000  he goes this probably about $30  or something  did she know it was a fake  she started getting real mad though 
[00:51:30]  like I don't like this guy low balling my stuff  and she wouldn't take his final  assessment  she wouldn't even hear it  he said well what you paid for it  is different than what it's worth  because you paid such and such an amount  but it's worth about  maybe $5,000  and she was all pissed off  she just thought  her collection was worth a lot  to her it's worth it 
[00:52:00]  it's her everyday life  it's her whole life  dumb fuck shoes  and so it's very important to her  and she sees it as very expensive  but then you get a guy in there  that does this for a living  it's just another collection  so his is going to be more accurate  he's not attached to it emotionally  so that was that  and this dumb fucking bitch  with these crazy dolls  do you know I've seen stuff  it's funny  like I've looked at stuff  that I have  like I have a lot of UFC signed stuff  like I have a couple of books 
[00:52:30]  signed by like  like so many of the guys  fucking Hoist Gracie  and a whole shitload I got  on these Dana White mag  and I see how much  these autographs go for  I'm like fuck  these are worth money  it's nothing that occurred to me  to sell them though  I have no desire to sell that shit  you didn't get them to sell  you got them  because you like this shit  but it's like sometimes  you have stuff that's worth more  but it's emotionally  I can't let that stuff go  I love that stuff  yeah  but I have everything  from the time I was  I've never thrown out  anything wrestling related  so I have all the old t-shirts  all the old paraphernalia  that they sold  and that's the stuff  that actually goes for money 
[00:53:00]  because you can't get it  it's not mass produced anymore  right  rock t-shirts  it's funny  old rock t-shirts  are worth  I almost bought one  when I did the Aussie tribute  a couple years ago  I wanted to wear like an old  but I just  I'm too fucking fat  for the mediums  what happened to people  were people in 1990  or 1980  1970  all 108 pound twinks  how do these shirts  are all so small  the old rock shirts  but they're all fucking expensive man  they used to shrink  like fucking crazy  especially the  the early 80s ones  even the late 70s 
[00:53:30]  if you went to a concert  and bought a shirt  one washing  it would be a midriff top  that you couldn't even put your head  through the fucking head hole anymore  and then they were made of material  that was  I think it was like  five thread count  it was like  you're wearing mesh  but I was looking recently  on my  when I moved out of my parents house  finally  and this is going back  fucking you know  13 years  I was 30  but I got all my shit out of there  I had all these rock  I probably had 50 rock shirts  I'm looking at them like  why did you throw them out  but I'm like  what I wear them again 
[00:54:00]  yeah  I'm not gonna wear them  and you wouldn't want to sell them  I know  I just  I literally  the way I want to collect stuff  I act  like I have an 8 story house  I want displays  but nobody would give a shit  like my dream  is to own a place  where it's like  I just walk around  and go  huh  and nobody fucking cares  but me  it's stupid  baseball cards  people care about  stuff like that  but nobody gives a fuck  about the stuff I like  where you're wrestling  I'm not shit 
[00:54:30]  and it is in the presentation  most people don't give a fuck  dude  you're right  most people don't  your posters are really nice  but if you had 300 of them  nobody would care  you have fucking 10  and that's the beauty of it  it's just kind of there  for the room  not only do they not care  they think it's lame  like  this is stupid  why would you have  all this stuff  well if you have  a few good things  that you wanted to display  and then you know  just store the rest  right  that's fine  yeah  a few good things  what is your  you don't have a holy grail  for wrestling stuff  that you want  I would keep asking 
[00:55:00]  the same question  it's just the ring use stuff  like I would  ring used  yeah like tights  like macho man boots  like yellow  with the stars on it  something like that  Hulk's wife's condoms  used condoms  tied up  and shoved in  E-Rog's pants  why don't we ask  Vince or somebody  from wrestling  or Mick Foley  why don't you get  some from Mick Foley  that's one of my  favorite things  that I have  is one time  when JBL was in here  he brought in  a cowboy hat  that he had worn  on Raw  for me  and he gave it to me 
[00:55:30]  and he signed it  and there was a stain  on the inside  from when CM Punk  had thrown whiskey  at him  on TV  holy shit  and so that was  like amazing to me  now you own that  yeah  but Mick's not gonna  give you anything  because he's selling  all of his stuff  right  he started  he sold it  all for charity  like he put a ton  of his  Mick Foley foundation  that chiseler  he put a ton  of his ring used  stuff on eBay  but like  I want it badly  he had his boots  with leopard print  and there were still 
[00:56:00]  thumbtacks in the bottom  from one of his matches  with Ric Flair  and I wanted it  but they went for like  $3,000 or more  which I think  they should have gone  for more  but  you do  I couldn't afford  $3,000 for a pair  of Mick Foley boots  Mick's a weird guy  because I'm fascinated  with him  because he's a really  good dude  and he is  he's just a complete  penny pincher  but he's also  generous with his time  for charity  like he really does  give away  he's not a dick  I'm fascinated  with that guy  he's just such a  wacko in every way  he's a good egg 
[00:56:30]  he's a great guy  but he does get  stranger every time  we talk  dude he's out of  his  he's coming in later  tonight actually  he's performing  at the Brokerage  in Long Island  at 8 o'clock  brokeragecomedy.com  he's still in stand up  I would love to see  Mick Foley perform stand up  last time he came in here  he said he was  as WWE champion  he slept on some  fans couch  and it was just like  what?  yeah  like I would like to know  how close I was  to having Mick Foley  sleep over my house  because if I knew  that was a possibility  yeah you probably  could have done that  I would do that today 
[00:57:00]  how creepy  Mick opens his eyes  you're just staring at him  from like 3 inches away  taking photos  with the flash off  no you open your eyes  and Mick is down  at the foot of your bed  smelling your feet  and jerking off  oh shit  you'd enjoy that  I'd be alright  it's like yeah  why not  sure go ahead  Mick  finish yourself off  you know what  before an earthquake  happens or something  oh see  now it's possible  it is  come on now  let's eat

[01:02:30]  action figure  whatever  but there is a  couple of audio  things I wanted  to play  or I didn't  want to play  I got them  Sam brought them  in  brought them to  my attention  what are they  well one  is CBS news story  on the earthquake  people describe  the devastation  reporters like  to play  like play on words  I guess  is what they're doing  the reporters  I've noticed  there was a lot  of  I think even 
[01:03:00]  the news knew  they couldn't  really jump  on this one  and try to  panic everybody  but they did it  anyway  in a more subtle  roundabout way  this reporter  tried to  and I think  this is from  yesterday  I think today  everybody kind of  really realizes  that nothing  happened  but they were  still trying to  like get the  panic from  everybody  yeah and we  have a clip  of Dr.  Michio Kaku  talking about  the whole thing  it could happen  who are you  I've never met 
[01:03:30]  Jim Norton  I live  he's very  petrified  he's fucking  so skittish  thanks for  coming in  ten minutes  at a high  don't hit me  here  my hair  I'll run  frightened  don't hit me  strings  alright  what  so CBS  news story  on the earthquake  shaken  not stirred 
[01:04:00]  a dancing  chandelier  first in  Williamstown  South Jersey  and a lighter  one here  inside a  25th floor  Manhattan  apartment  on Central  Park West  Errol Rappaport  rolling on  his cell phone  I didn't know  what it was  because I  figured in  New York  City we  never have  earthquakes  my right  elbow was  leaning against  something  and there  was a  vibration  and the  vibration  kept getting  bigger  Mayor Bloomberg  felt it  I was like  I'm getting  out of here  I'm not  staying  I'm not  taking any  chances  yeah  fucking  Bloomberg  I was leaning  on a pile  of money  fucking  creep  get out of 
[01:04:30]  here  I'm not  staying  I'm not  taking any  chances  in Bed-Stuy  this woman  so frightened  she spent  the afternoon  outside  and at a  coffee shop  in Dyker Heights  exactly  it's more  dangerous  being outside  in Bed-Stuy  shop in Dyker Heights  they say the  pots are swayed  like this  a little bit  yeah  we're not used  to that sort  of thing  around here  where were you  when the  earthquake struck  this guy  getting a haircut  or a quake cut  outside we felt  what  what is that 
[01:05:00]  even mean  when Michael J. Fox  cuts your hair  quake  air cut  or a quake cut  outside we felt  the ground  shocking left  and right  and I thought  it was dizzy  but everyone  felt it  but two native  Californians  just couldn't agree  earthquake or not  oh yeah  I've lived  through three of them  so I know  I didn't know  what it was  I was sitting  in my car  in the driveway  and the car  went  what is that  and then it was over 
[01:05:30]  and here live  at the crossroads  of the world  only an earthquake  could stop traffic  and freeze tourists  in their tracks  thankfully  it only lasted  15 seconds  only an earthquake  could stop traffic  in Manhattan  for 15 seconds  no everything can  yes  only an earthquake  could probably  free it up a little bit  yeah  yeah  only fucking  only a pedestrian  standing in the middle  of the crosswalk  can stop traffic  morons  yeah that guy  and what did  quake cut  quake cut 
[01:06:00]  uh  like a quake cut  for the show  that was a chip joke  more like a quake cut  yes quake cut  that was pretty good though  cause I was saying  like what's everybody doing  shaking rattling  and rolling  or something  rattling  rattling  and now I guess  Dr. Michi Kaku  a regular on this program  who has no idea  who we are  who any of us are  and is petrified  of anybody  I've seen him  400 times  in my neighborhood  and every time 
[01:06:30]  I see him  hello Dr. Kaku  oh hi  oh hi  oh hi  oh  I love  the scared  Michi Kaku  it's fucking  enraging  you'd think  at one point  he would be like  ah  um  even if he goes  uh  yes  from the show  he remembers  what pi squared is  he remembers  all numbers  ah if you take x  and make it 400 times  he knows all that  hi  ah I've never seen you  Eric remembers 
[01:07:00]  pi round  oh  oh  poor fat kid  by the way  I still want to take  the staff to lunch  I'm sorry I keep saying  that and I haven't done it  oh  that'll cost you  I'm not paying for it  I'm just going to  shepherd them  Dr. Michi Kaku  on the earthquake  now let me ask you  about what I know  our viewers on the west coast  are probably thinking  because they go through  a lot of quakes  some of them bigger than this  are they right to say 
[01:07:30]  hey guys  this is  this is not so big  there's a difference  between west coast  and east coast earthquakes  the west coast  is very fragmented  look at this  the fault lines  are like this  so when an earthquake  fall moves or shifts  the energy is localized  therefore the damage  is concentrated  so one shifts  but not everything  that's right  the energy is localized  you were saying  on the east coast  right  we have the north  american plate  and so it rocks  as one  Iraq eats off of  all the way to Canada 
[01:08:00]  for it  he's shaking his head  for Iraq  I know it's every single line  the north american plate  the north american plate  just never ends  I'm sorry Eric  it just  and I'm sorry  but I'll do it again  in a second  of course you will  and I'll always go  come on  and I'll laugh  every time  of course  oh look at the fat kid  yeah  we kind of missed  the end of that  because of  Iraq getting in the way 
[01:08:30]  with his joke  and so energy  is scattered  all the way to Canada  for example  and you know  well I was going to say  you were telling me  earlier that it's a  wake up call  for the east coast  that we are not immune  that's right  we have to prepare  our building codes  for the once  in the century earthquake  we are not prepared  at all  our buildings  don't sway  like those  in California  and our building  has sway  our buildings  would collapse  if we had a major  earthquake in Manhattan  and realize that  Indian Point  can only withstand  a 6.0 earthquake 
[01:09:00]  and that's a nuclear  power plant  north of New York City  a sit really  can only survive  a 6  and it was a 5.9  or a 5.8  we were like  .1 away from  nuclear meltdown  disaster  wading through  nuke stuff  if it's the epicenter  the epicenter  wow  so he's saying  we're not really  prepared  with building codes  so what are we  supposed to do  like rip down  every fucking  brick building  in New York City 
[01:09:30]  take the whole  Manhattan skyline  flatten that out  and start fresh  with you know  all these  earthquake proof  buildings like  they had to put  in LA and San Francisco  what time did it  happen  that was about  2 o'clock  in the afternoon  2 a.m.  I did hear  something  I did hear  something  I had an  earthquake  at 2 a.m.  I was drunk  and I fell  down the stairs  I thought there  was somebody  in my apartment  I honestly  did at one  point  I heard  something  it was right  around that  time I thought 
[01:10:00]  somebody was  in my apartment  so I actually  walked out of  my bedroom  and looked  around  and I thought  that must  be from  upstairs  and what  would you  have done  nothing  gotten shot  yeah I would  have reacted  the way  cuckoo does  to me  in a restaurant  he turns  Indian  he's very  scared  that's why  his hair  is white  he probably  was brown  one day  and then  saw me  in the  neighborhood  and went  white  he just  got petrified  he was a  great radio  guest on  Art Bell  I don't know  what ever  happened to  Art Bell  remember him  Art Bell 
[01:10:30]  was  coast to  coast  the shadow  people  weird conspiracy  shit and UFOs  all of it  but he was  good  Derek still  listens to  Art Bell  Derek loves  Art Bell  I do too  I don't think  Art Bell's on  the air anymore  I think it's  George Norrie  I think he is  because Derek's  mentioned that he  falls asleep  listening to  Art Bell  so he's either  listening to  old tapes  or he's still  on somewhere  Art Bell I used  to ride around  listening to  when we were  kicked off the  air  I could listen 
[01:11:00]  to him or  Joe Benigno  on sports  that wouldn't  depress me  because I  could listen  to shows  like this  yeah because  it was nothing  like we would  do  right  but Art Bell  is fucking  sometimes you'd  have guests  that were just  awful  he's retired  what  thank you  is that turkey  chili  at this hour  it's crazy  no I'll have  some later  though Kenny  thank you  thank you though  later  yeah so yeah I  guess that's it  with our earthquake  eclipse is that 
[01:11:30]  all we got I  saw some some  video at some  of the places it  got shaken pretty  good I guess in  Virginia the  epicenter they  had some shit  falling off shelves  at a grocery  store but you  know what it is  it's like when we  make fun of those  states that where  it never snows and  then they get like a  dusting of snow and  it completely shuts  down the city and  we sit there and  go oh really  really so it's the  same thing people in  LA look at us and  people in San  Francisco look at us 
[01:12:00]  and go how could  they put that penis  in a vagina  it's terrible  see San Francisco  because they're gay  oh  it's cute  that was  you thought I was  gonna go one way  I went whoosh  no I knew you'd go  that way  of course you did  yeah I wonder what  the most valuable  thing broken was  somebody right now  who something has  broken yesterday  that is irreplaceable  and they're miserable  about it  very valuable  I would love to  know  making fun saying  nothing happened  fucking I lost  my  yeah it could just 
[01:12:30]  be something  sentimental I would  love to know what  somebody has lost  that they really are  gonna fucking miss  probably nothing  nothing  I'm just trying to  make a bed out of  nothing  it was just  it was  it was a  it was an  interesting little  event but not  nothing that  you  it was a  who gives a  shit  go like  yeah  like I said  I slept through it  I think a real  earthquake I probably  would have woken up  I hate the way  Obama runs up and  down the steps  the way he does  his little jog run  up and down the  steps  oh his jog  and I 
[01:13:00]  I hate  because he was  watching him  doing some  campaigning  on the TV  on the TV  and the way he  just rolls his  shirt sleeves up  when he leaves  his little tour bus  or the  when he walks out  into the crowd  it's like look  he's working  yeah  he's in front  of a bunch  of pallets  talking to  people  working  Joe's  and he's  got to roll  up his  shirt sleeves  like I'm  ready to  do some  work here  I'm the  common man  no you're  not  I do think 
[01:13:30]  he's a nice  man though  I really do  no I think  he's mean  nah  I really  think  it's hard  to really  dislike  even though  I don't  agree with  him  it's hard  to dislike  anybody  like him  or Carter  who really  do like  poor people  I think  Carter  really did  like the  idea of  helping the  poor  out of  out of  just his  principles  I think  Obama likes  the idea  of helping  the poor  out of  getting his  job back  again  and it  looks good  on his 
[01:14:00]  legacy  but I don't  think he  really enjoys  it  I don't think  that's one of  his passions  like Jimmy  Carter  is swinging  a fucking  hammer  with Habitat  for Humanity  after he  was president  he told the  secret service  to go fuck  themselves  I don't need  any secret  service  Nixon did  the same  thing  paid for  his own  security  but Jimmy  Carter  has security  he does  not walk  around without  any secret  service  he has  to  he told  him no  maybe he  pays for  somebody 
[01:14:30]  he might  pay for  his own  private  security  but it's  not  secret  service  because I'll  tell you  why  they fucking  hate him  Muslims  hate him  because he  fucking  took care  of the  Shah Moran  yeah  maybe they  like him  more now  because he  was anti-Israel  but  he's such  a non-issue  now  god  Muslims  hold a  fucking  grudge  don't they  there's  fucking  five or  six  ex-presidents  they're all  important  guys  yeah  yeah  yeah  symbolically  pretty  important  Gaddafi  wow  did you  see them  partying  at his  compound  man 
[01:15:00]  like it's  1999  or something  right guys  just like  that ship  it was  I guess  he took  off  right  he ran  and everybody  just jumped  in there  there was  one guy  wearing one  of his  hats  like his  gold  fucking  turban  he had  holding a  gold chain  like they  just looted  his house  and were  wearing like  his  Gaddafi  shit  and jumping  around in  the street  like woo  look at us  somewhere he's 
[01:15:30]  watching it on  tv like  what the fuck  just like I was  just there  and now they're  just ranting  with all my  shit  leave my  shit alone  then knocking  his wrestling  figures down  on the shelves  yeah that'd be  like them  going playing  with all my  wrestling  you don't play  with them  you just play  them  imagine watching tv  and seeing people  just wreck your  shit like that  I'd be so pissed  yeah  I bet you used to  play with them  though  I'd make them  go like  you know the noises  you make with dolls  when they're like  you know like  you probably make  them jump off  the top rope  that's what I would  do with my  G.I. Joe dolls  yeah fucking get 
[01:16:00]  that Charlie  get that get  the gook  that's what I  would be like  when I was  growing up  because that was  the war that  was going on  sure  you know  yes Korea  so I had  my G.I. Joe's  and uh  you know  I had to play  with him  and make like  he was in war  because it's  G.I. Joe  what's he gonna  do  peacetime  G.I. Joe  organized and  obsessive with my  wrestling figure  federation  I had record  books  I wrote down 
[01:16:30]  I'll see  that's crazy  what  yeah  what  that's great  when I was a  kid I did  the same thing  I have notebooks  somewhere  because I  wouldn't have  thrown them  out  I had a little  gold dust  notebook  oh that's  crazy  yeah and I  had like  listings of  who was  fighting tonight  and who was  when  I guess you  didn't see  computers coming  where you could  just google that  shit  yeah  you have  fucking  worthless  hours  no no no  my wrestling  figures  matches  the matches  that I would  put on  between the  figures  ew  what a dick 
[01:17:00]  not even real  I did the same  thing  you're a dick  too  what does that  mean he's not  a dick  like if Hulk Hogan  was wrestling the  ultimate warrior  I'd write that  match down  and who won  but you made them  win  so you could have  written the whole  thing in advance  yeah  like real wrestling  you knew  yes  you knew  that is lame  I would write out  cards  I had my own  pay-per-view names  yeah exactly  me too  and I would have  to do  I'd have to do  four raws  before I did  another pay-per-view  because that would  I wouldn't have to  wait literally a  month  but four raws 
[01:17:30]  would represent  four weeks  of television  so then I  could do  another pay-per-view  why didn't you  just have  Wrestlemania  every day  because I was  booking a show  I was booking  a federation  I was wanting  to put on a  product that  people would  enjoy seeing  you should have  shot yourself  on tape  then  imaginations  better than  kids these days  not better than  kids these days  they're all on  computers  well like a  retard  you went  ding ding ding  with a fucking  wrestling doll  kids these days  blow you away  no 
[01:18:00]  kids these days  are smarter  shows I was  putting on  I had the  12 inch  G.I. Joe  I never considered  the small  G.I. Joe  with the fuzzy  hair  yeah the fuzzy  hair  the lifelike  hair  you had hair  like that  fuzzy in the  beard  you were  G.I. Mo  that's great  but see that  was cool  because you  were you  know we're  fighting  I wish  Gaddafi had  had an  action figure  collection 
[01:18:30]  and just  got humiliated  for being  childlike  like you  yeah but I'm  not like a  world leader  no I'm not  even a show  leader  exactly  well I  read the  after show  yeah  it's kind  of a show  it's true  I had a  little drama  this morning  on the way  in too  I get  a text  from my  girl  and she  goes  hey  someone's  ringing  the doorbell  someone's  ringing the  doorbell  at the  house  when  right after 
[01:19:00]  I left  when you  were driving  in  you got  yes  then I  get the  text  so now  I'm like  oh shit  what the fuck  you know  what's going  on here  yeah  so I  go okay  make sure  the alarm  is set  so she  set the  alarm  I go okay  now go  go to the  go to the  closet  oh good  she puts  the code  in  like now  grab  the 12  gauge  and she's  like  which one 
[01:19:30]  is that  oh I was  about to ask  if she knows  how to shoot  I know  now I'm  like oh  boy  so I'm  trying to  drive  as I'm  texting  and then I  realized I  better just  I better  just call  so I  called  and I'm  talking her  through  I go okay  you got the  shotgun  now rack it  what do you  mean  all the  talking  I do  all the  you never  taken her  down to the  range or  anything  yes I  have  and she  doesn't  remember  she's afraid  to shoot  the gun 
[01:20:00]  it's loud  she would  never be able  to shoot  an intruder  I don't  think so  not with a  giant shotgun  crazy  but I'm  trying to  tell her  I go  you know  I don't  think there's  any rounds  in there  so I go  I go  open  and look  in the  breach  what okay  it's the  hole in the  side of the  gun  when you  pull the  so now  I'm gonna  have to  I'm really  gonna have  to show  her the  deal  here  there's  no way  an accident  can happen  this is  being handled  so well  as you're  on the  fucking  LIE  doing 80  on an 
[01:20:30]  iPhone  I'm trying  to talk  her through  loading a  shotgun  just hear a  blast  oh no  I said  whatever  I'm telling  you  whatever  you do  do not  touch the  trigger  just do  what I'm  telling you  go open  the breach  put a  shell in  and then  she's like  well what if  there's more  than two  one P  person  I go  okay  look  now  I go  turn the  gun over  I know  I know  put the  powder in  now tamp  it down  now take  some  wadding  so I'm 
[01:21:00]  trying to  tell her  how to  slide the  rounds  because you  can slide  about eight  rounds in  to the  bottom of  the gun  why did I  think only two  shotgun shells  when an eight  can go in  two is like a  double barrel  where you crack  barrel it goes  like that  and then you put  two in the  barrel in the  chamber and then  you click it  back that's two  shots  this is a pump  shotgun where you  just go  and it's got  an eight shot  magazine 
[01:21:30]  that's cool  that you can  just slide  eight rounds  in  so I go  okay  turn the  gun over  now slide  around in  and she goes  okay  it's not  really gone  I go  she goes  the brass  end goes  forward  oh no  like no  no  and I'm  realizing  I really  had to  it never  would have  fired  but I'm  like now  you gotta  get it  out of  there  because  now you  can't  get any  rounds  in there  so she  goes  okay  I got  it out  it's like  a Remington 
[01:22:00]  870  and by the  way  if there  was an  intruder  it would  have been  finished  already  that's why  I was  trying to  get this  as quickly  as possible  I wasn't  like wait  till I get  to work  where I  could call  you  so I'm  doing it  as you're  talking to  your black  voice  go no  no  no  you're  doing  it  wrong  and then  he actually  helps her  pick it  up like  this  and so  so  yeah  she finally  loaded those  in  I go  okay  now  rack it  back  but don't  push it  don't push  the slide  forward  so she  goes  I hear  it  goes back  I go  okay  now look 
[01:22:30]  in the  breach  that's the  hole on  the right  side of  the gun  that is  now exposed  from pulling  the slide  back  and do you  see a  shotgun shell  in position  to go  in to  the chamber  now  she goes  well I  see one  in there  I'm like  ah  good  okay  now  just  push the  thing  forward  now  I go  okay  you're all  set  she's now  standing in  your house  with a loaded  shotgun  yes  I go  I go  now  I go  just put 
[01:23:00]  it down  I go  make sure  it's pointing  in a safe  direction  not at you  I go  don't  yeah  I go  don't  point it  near yourself  your feet  anything  put it  in a safe  place  so she  put it  down  next to  the bed  I go  any problems  you know  you hear  anything  I go  just point  it at  the door  and just  you know  wait  make sure  that you  identify  your target  get ready  for the  shit  to go  down  call  the police  first  don't shoot  anything  how much  does a shotgun  weigh like that shotgun  that one's not heavy 
[01:23:30]  it's really light  it's like a Remington  870  it's pretty  it's pretty light  and how much pressure  does the trigger need  it doesn't take much  the slide is easy  it's a very easy  gun for a girl  like an automatic  pistol  little more difficult  for a girl  to pull the slide back  but  no  it's fine  she knows exactly  what to do  it's down there  she knows the safety  of it  and she knows  a lot of the other guns  like she could have  had the  AR-15  loaded 
[01:24:00]  and ready to go  but  you know  I figured a shotgun  would be better  I never really  showed her the shotgun  why'd you take her  to the range  did you try to shoot  I did  oh you did  but she gets very  she doesn't like  the loud noise  even with the ear  things on  and the kick  she can't shoot it  at a target  a piece of paper  with you know  ear protectors  and goggles on  and everything  well if you're being  ready to be  intruded upon  yeah then  then you know  you kind of  you gotta  you gotta get  your courage up  yeah 
[01:24:30]  for that moment  but I was  all I'm thinking  is like  oh boy  so then when I got in  I had to pull up  all my cameras  and rewind  some of my security  cameras to look  watch  I watched me leave  and then I watched  until her first text  came in  and there was  nobody there  nothing happened  maybe it was an earthquake  the doorbell rang  but sometimes  that happens  when the phone  gets called  basically you're living  with a crazy person  who now has a loaded gun  waiting for you  to come home  that's good 
[01:25:00]  she's delusional now  we'll have a gun battle  in the house  no she  she absolutely knows  not to just  pull the trigger  from a noise  you'll come in  hand on your pistol  just ready  watch it  high noon  there she goes  don't shoot the maids  they're supposed  to be coming in soon  she's gonna be  shooting at you  from the balcony  as you walk into your house  yeah  like Scarface  it's me  yeah  she goes  no I know  that's why  having you show me  how to load it  so I can shoot you  exactly  you suck 
[01:25:30]  that would be  a great story  I don't want you  to get shot  but if you had to  how awful would that be  it'd be the way  I'd walk her  through the whole thing  and she blasts me  it would beat the closet story  it really would  yes  oh would that be horrible  no that's  everything's fine  and there aren't  any intruders  my neighborhood  is very safe  so who was calling  at that hour  sometimes  when my home phone  which is now  hooked up to the  fax machine  because who uses 
[01:26:00]  their hard line anymore  you know  really  do you use a fax though  do you ever use a fax  yeah  sometimes I have to fax things  to Bob Eatman  or the accountant  I hate faxes  they never work  really  never  I can never get a fax to work  really  wrong line  oh it's a fucking nightmare  in my house  it's easy  you just put the number in  and it goes  it goes baby  yeah I  because now I have to fax  I need ink actually 
[01:26:30]  for my fax  and printer  because I have to print out  some more tax things  because apparently  again  I thought you were going to say  the IRS is now looking at me  again  you had to print out instructions  on how to load a shotgun  on how to load a shotgun  I probably should do that  and just nail those to the wall  but again  yeah the IRS has decided  to take a look  I think my  my diatribes  on various media  have gotten the attention  of somebody  in the Internal Revenue Service  where they are now  taking peaks 
[01:27:00]  at every single year  of my tax returns  but let them  you pay  yeah they do  I think they found something though  that I erroneously  left off of a tax return  nothing big  but it was like  a couple of stocks  things like that  you didn't sell them right  or you did  no I did  but the great thing  about the Internal Revenue Service  is if you have  unreported  stock  trade  that you did  let's say I sold  let's say I bought 
[01:27:30]  Widgets  Incorporated  for  one dollar a share  right  and I sold it  for 50 cents a share  to get out  because it was going down  I have  made 50 cents  on one piece of paper  but I'm actually  losing 50 cents  they don't look at  what you bought it for  because you didn't  give them that information  so all they will  bill you on  is saying  you made 50 cents 
[01:28:00]  a share on this stock  pay us  so it's your responsibility  to let them know  to let them know  what my buying price was  to show them  that no indeed  I had lost 50 cents  well how do they see  the selling price  but not the buying price  exactly  they see what they  want to fucking see  oh okay  yeah  and the reason they  know it is because  they get a form from  E-Trade  saying that  he made this trade  but for some reason  they only see  how much I got  when I sold the stock  not what it cost me 
[01:28:30]  so now I gotta send  can't they cross reference  oh they can  anything they can do  where you won't  owe them money  they will not do  that's their fucking game  you know  with computers  I had a thing  where I was paying  off my mortgage  I've been obsessed  for five years  with dumping  everything I made  into principal  so I paid it off  and still didn't get  anything for three months  and I go to the bank  and I'm like  no no you still owe  a thousand dollars  I'm like no  I don't owe a thousand dollars  so I went in 
[01:29:00]  went through the whole  process again  it wasn't the guys  in the bank  it was the people  on the phone  and they had applied  my last payment  incorrectly  and put it into escrow  so they said  I still owed money  but it was like  how with computers  do you not know  A who was fucking  around in my account  how do you know  which agent did this  and I had the bank  manager there  as my witness  I said how do you  not cross reference  on a fucking computer  I don't understand  how with computers  if you overpay me  say I go to get  five hundred dollars  out of the bank  and they pay me 
[01:29:30]  ten thousand  they know  oh they find  that shit out  but how come  you can't cross  reference  the money I paid  you  and then just  check why  it didn't go  why is that  a nightmare  situation to do  I have no idea  but it's exactly  what they do  they always do it  where they can't  cross reference  to take care of  what you should  have taken care of  but man  if you fuck them  for a dollar  they know it  they find that out  really quick  I have another  problem with  the IRS  in the same  vein as this 
[01:30:00]  because it was  attached to the  same stock thing  you're claiming  Goebbels as a  dependent  it was  Philadelphia  Lottery  Commission  and  I never  claimed  that I had  won  two thousand  five hundred  dollars on a  scratch off  ticket  in Philly  but  I didn't  what had  happened is  some  fucking  savage  cocksucker  had used 
[01:30:30]  my name  had some  type of  identification  and another  savage  asshole  fucking  took  the  goddamn  ID  the fake  ID  and the  lottery  ticket  and cashed  it  with my  name  didn't have  my social  security  number  or anything  didn't have  that  which you're  supposed to  give them  when you do  that  so all they  had was my  name  and  there I am  now stuck  for the tax  burden of  this  no 
[01:31:00]  but now  I don't  even know  how to  go about  letting the  IRS  because I'm  sure they'll  be so  understanding  and just  believe me  to say  it wasn't  me  someone did  this  there is a  police report  but now I  have to  fucking go  through all  this shit  to get this  information  send it to  the IRS  and and  you know  have them  believe  that this  was uh  somebody ripping  off my  identification  to to  cash this  fucking  ticket  I wound up 
[01:31:30]  seeing some  of the  surveillance  video  from the  store  where they  cashed  the ticket  oh yeah  yeah  I got  some  friends  how long  ago  did this  happen  uh  this has  to be  now  2009  and they  still have  surveillance  footage  yeah I  well I saw  it at the  time  oh okay  at the time  because they  were trying  to see like  do you even  know who  this guy  is  or anything  I'm like  I don't  hang around  with those  people  I have no  idea who  the fuck  that is  but here  he comes  strutting  in the  fucking  store  right there  he looks  around  buys a  couple  little 
[01:32:00]  and the  fucking  idiot  savage  behind  the  counter  gives  him  fucking  $2,500  with my  name  and ID  that's weird  because in  New York  you can't  cash in  more than  like five  or six  hundred  dollars  in a  store  you've  got to  well here's  the worst  part  I'm waiting  for the  other shoe  to drop  as they  say  because  he won  $5,000  he had  two  fucking  $2,500  winning  tickets  god only  knows  he probably  stole  them  somehow  I don't  know how  it works  but uh  he cashed 
[01:32:30]  both of  them one  on one  day  and the  one  on the  next  day  both  using  my  name  so now  I'm sure  that one  will turn  up somewhere  now  how could  he use  your ID  if fucking  the picture  did he look  like you  no he was  a black  guy  he was a  fucking  black  guy  a crook  a criminal  but how  would he  use your  ID  with your  face  he probably  had a  name  but then  had his  picture put  on there  but only  the name  he's using  yeah  it was the  name  and my  address  oh  okay  yeah  I don't 
[01:33:00]  identity theft  that's  fucking  scary  I'm  signed  up  with  a couple  of  identity  theft  services  do they  help  and every  month  you get  an email  that says  everything's  cool  don't worry  about it  everything's  fine  and then  occasionally  you'll be  like we've  noticed some  activity on  this credit  card or that  one  you're like  oh okay  no that's  fine  I want  that I  want to  find out  well I  got that  after this  episode  happened  but the  guy didn't  use it as  anything else  never had my  social security  number  did have my  name and  address 
[01:33:30]  then put  his own  picture on  there I  gather  and I  was just  fucking  livid  like you  fucking  typical  Philly  fucking  animal  you  douchebag  fucking  cunt  and seeing  him on  camera just  doing that  just pissed  me off  but then I  thought it  was like  all right  well whatever  it's done  and over  with  and then  yesterday  I opened  up that  envelope  from the  IRS  and there  it is  $2,500  that I  got to  explain  because some  fucking  animal  is 
[01:34:00]  it's  pulling  bullshit  shenanigans  using my  fucking  name  Pennsylvania  lottery  retailers  can pay  prizes  up to  and including  $2,500  I would bet  you those  scratch off  tickets weren't  even real  they were fake  or stolen  two $2,500  tickets  the maximum  that you can  just cash  into the store  inside job  the fucking  other  his other  fucking  savage  friend  behind the  counter  go fuck  yourself  god damn  please  you know  my  address 
[01:34:30]  come  over  fuck  break  into a  house  like a  man  you  fucking  pussy  cashing  lottery  tickets  with my  fucking  ID  your  little  name  and  address  was  on it  too  yeah  yeah  yeah  you know  where I  live  you fucking  you know  what I'll  call you  on my  drive  home  oh boy  when that  happened  and I saw  that tape  holy  Jesus  Palomino  that word  a record  use  past  1865  you look  a little  tall  on video  oh 
[01:35:00]  was I  fucking  mad  it's  violating  it feels  violating  and to  watch it  on video  it's like  the guy  just  and this  dummy  behind the  counter  just  paying  out  $2,500  and now  I'm liable  for taxes  on it  and I  gotta prove  now  that I  didn't win  that fucking  thing  give me  a break  how do you  prove it  yeah  I gotta  now  but now  I gotta  deal with  the police  report  I don't  want to  deal with  the fucking  thing  and I  gotta  get all  this shit  together  and send 
[01:35:30]  it off  to some  examiner  at the  IRS  so he  can look  at it  and say  well  we need  this now  and that  leave me  the fuck  alone  I give  you enough  that's why  I hate  this tax  shit  boy the fact  they're coming  after you  for a little  bit on  $2,500  in Philly  yeah  yeah  $2,500  for a lottery  ticket in  Philly  blow me  oh god  all I can  hope is  that the guy  that cashed  it  was lying  on a street  somewhere with  a bullet wound  to his neck  bleeding out 
[01:36:00]  slowly  watching his  dumb fucking  useless life  flash before  his dumb  fucking useless  eyes  maybe he was  trying to buy  things for his  family  oh please  right  what crack  and some malt  liquor  you fucking  get a job  you thieving  cunt  oh was  I  I'm so  it brought  it all back  yesterday  it brought  it all back  when I opened  up that envelope  and saw  the $2,500  for this shit  it was settled  how much  is the taxes  on it  just pay it  yeah that's 
[01:36:30]  like you know  considered  fucking gambling  winning so it's  taxed at a higher  rate and it's  you know I'm not  going to fucking  pay some  fucking animals  taxes  do they give  you a tax  break on your  losses  gambling losses  you can  you can  put a certain  percentage of  your losses  against your  winnings  let's just say  you go right  and you gamble  and you win  a hundred grand  you pay tax  on that  yeah  let's say you 
[01:37:00]  just go one  time and you  gamble and you  lose a hundred  grand is it all  a write off  no  so why is  everything you  win a write  off and  everything you  lose not  exactly  I mean  yeah  taxable  you can use  some of your  losses against  your winnings  if you're in  the plus  you have no  winnings  then you're  just fucked  then you just  lost money  but why will  they allow  you  yeah  yeah  isn't that  amazing  how do they  fucking do  that  you can't  use your  losings as  a write off  but yeah  but you can  but they gotta  take a piece 
[01:37:30]  of the winning  like you can  they just  they just  win  there's no  gamble for  them  whatsoever  you lose  they win  you win  they win  it's just  it's  and who  who voted  for that  who said  this is  what we  want  as a  people  that you  represent  you go  to  washington  and tell  them  we want  our losses  to not  be reimbursed  or be able  to be  written off  but our  winnings 
[01:38:00]  we want  you to  tax it  hey  is ron paul  any good  eh  he's a little  wacky  i find  most ron paul  supporters  are a little  nuts  but i hear  a lot  about him  and i  kind of  want to  i'm starting  to think  a lot  of people  like him  he's like  a mind  your own  business  guy  he doesn't  like to  get involved  with world  affairs  doesn't like  the big  government  he's a little  wacky  but is he  is he smart  i mean  is he  i just  can't get  past the  wackiness  what's wacky  about him  he almost  reminds me 
[01:38:30]  of like  who was that  nut that was  running  a few years  back  yeah  but even  he was a  smart guy  he just  fell apart  yeah  yeah  let me see  you know  libertarian  kind of a  thing going  on there  yeah  what's he  he's a  libertarian  and did he  do well  in the  vote  last time  he's got  a name  he's got  supporters  but i  don't think  he'd have  a chance  in hell  of actually  winning  i don't know  i've been  hearing his  name a lot  man  i get a  lot of  tweets  about him  and a  lot of  rogan  loves him  so i  guess i  just read  some of  rogan's 
[01:39:00]  tweets  or whatever  yeah  revolution  revolution  oh  revolution  has love  in it  backwards  never realized  that  love revolution  it's a stretch  jeopardy  that is a  stretch  yeah it  also has  ton in it  he loves  revolution  yes  i'd be  interested to  know more  about him  i should  probably do  some more  ron paul  research  yeah  well  perry looks  like he's 
[01:39:30]  he's  he could  be a  front runner  and i  guess they  were thinking  about having  julianni be  his running  mate but  julianni's  got so  he's got a  lot of  baggage  he's got a  lot of  fucking  i want to  like like  i fucking  the republicans  with that  religious shit  with that  religious right  get the  fuck i'm  sick of it  that's where  they lose me  every time  mind your  business  it is  infuriating  leave gays  alone  stop with  the fucking  the obsession  with god  and family  go fuck  yourself

[01:47:00]  hackers hackers are like  10 years in the future  on those guys what are  you doing stuff they  can get it that's why i  don't mind banking  online because they get  through bank security  like if they want it  they're gonna get it  it's like they can get  through the fucking bank  of america or chase  they can get through  short i mean yeah it's  like any other and they  will be oh yeah  insurance that's a great  thing you don't like  the fdic it is until it  isn't it is until it  isn't that's how that's  how that shit works  what do you i have  hurricane insurance  yeah listen too many  people in your  neighborhood got their  houses knocked down go 
[01:47:30]  fuck yourself  bill's sleeping on a  mattress full of cash  but i paid the premium  go fuck yourself there  drowny  it's what we call an act  of god that we don't  cover sorry but i was  paying the uh premiums  all of it said  all of it said  thank you for that  thank you for being a  customer a loyal  customer for this many  years hey you got  frequent flyer miles you  got till tuesday to use  them yeah but i but  those were mine  go fuck yourself  that's the biggest scam 
[01:48:00]  ever with the airlines  all of it yeah  nothing is insured you  just hope it is they  just tell you  dude the two biggest  banks in every fuck i  mean two biggest  buildings in every  fucking city is going  to be a bank in an  insurance company they  don't get that way by  giving you any fucking  money it's the dumbest  shit we all work our  asses off and at the  end of the week you  you you're picturing  you're giving it to a  bank you're giving it  to other people they're  criminals they're fucking  counterfeiters they  fucking screwed up the 
[01:48:30]  entire economy and they  gave them the houses  back to do it all over  again it's hilarious and  you you you give them  your money yeah it's  like that that guy who  fucked you over yeah who  just fucked you over okay  and you're trying to you  clear everything up and  then next week would you  give him your driver's  license no yes well  that's basically as far  as my little intelligence  on this as far as i can  tell the same guy's got  the houses right back  again now you guys  better not do that again  it really it really but 
[01:49:00]  there's no recourse for  the for the for the  people anymore but you  can get to it if you  argue right you can nah  you can get what you  want when i went into  the bank and i always  tell them before you came  in about a problem i had  when i closed out my  mortgage and they  applied the wrong payment  wrong and i knew i  wasn't going to give  them another thousand  dollars and the  fucking one of the  thousand dollars out of  it and uh because you're  running off the plantation  but i fucking i went in and  i sat there with the  fucking bank manager and we  got the people on the phone  and uh made them do the  research and if you if you  are willing to sit there and  fucking go back and forth  with them they'll usually 
[01:49:30]  because as much as they  don't care about you or  your fucking money like  government contractors they  also don't have enough  invested to fuck you because  the guy you're talking to is  not the one making the  profit so how long how long  did you have to sit there  and beg them not to steal  from you i was i want to  hear this feel-good story  how how many people did you  have to talk to before they  didn't try to i didn't  beg you upside down i'm not  giving you shit i'm talking  about how you paid off the  fucking mortgage yes  upstanding citizen right here  goddamn american flag flying 
[01:50:00]  right behind him yeah right  and then you still have to go  in there and beg them not to  steal another thousand  but it wasn't i tell you  what it was it was absolute  incompetence because i had the  bank manager on my side like  this was done online like i  mean online on the uh on the  phone has the incompetence  ever worked in your favor that's  what i want to know do they  ever just talking about that  fuck up and give you a brand  we were talking about that and  how they catch it happens they  always catch that one yeah and  they'll be on it going letting  you know what date the time of  day you came in and they handed 
[01:50:30]  you too much money they were  taking an extra 50 bucks out of  my account my account for for  fucking years it's something  when i moved to la i had this  account i just left a little  bit of money and something so  like an asshole i wasn't paying  attention but then i finally  caught him and they've been  doing it for like a year and a  half and then when i caught him  they go yeah we're sorry sir  our records only go back three  months oh really it's like  really you're you're holding on  to millions and millions of  dollars here and you can't  three months of records you  can't tell me what happened in  march yeah so then i had to go 
[01:51:00]  through all that bullshit all  that bullshit all that bullshit  and they try to wear you down  to where you just say fuck it  but you will get what you want  and i tell you the fucking bank  manager he was actually the  location guy was great because  he knew i was right he goes he  talked to them and they did the  fucking thing she told me what  they had done they had applied it  to escrow i probably would have  wound up getting it back anyway  because they refund your escrow but  it was just the idea that they  couldn't just immediately cross  cross-reference on the computer  and see what happened it's like you  fucking lying motherfuckers  because again we if you give me  too much money you immediately  know where that money went  day they'll know oh we gave that 
[01:51:30]  guy too much money let's check on  the computer yeah get down here  by 11 before we charge you with  the crime yeah yeah  at&t was charging me when i went  to montreal last year they were  charging me because i got my  inter the package international  thing so you don't get raped on  the fucking thing and i remember  taking it off for a year because  again like you i wasn't paying  attention they were charging me so  they just refunded me over a  thousand fucking dollars with  excited i want interest too i want  all the the taxes i paid wow i  think i said the taxes on the  the taxes i paid on that money 
[01:52:00]  everything back and they gave it  back to me um over a thousand  dollars if you're adamant enough  with them um and you know what  you're talking about they will  almost always if you're right give  you back if i can keep my if i can  keep myself calm i just use the  magic word unacceptable the dude  that's unacceptable yes unacceptable  unacceptable and you can't lose  your mind you can't curse no what  they do is i i think that they're  trying to make you mad so you curse  and then they go uh sir yeah we  can't i can't listen to that  language and they hang i shan't 
[01:52:30]  yeah yeah unacceptable back to  start i fucking use i use that in  the bank i was on a speaker phone  with the bank manager and i said  that's absolutely unacceptable i said  unacceptable about 30 times exactly  the word i use you know absolutely  completely unacceptable you know  they have the geek squad for  computers they should have like like  the geeks look squad for something  like that uh to complain and be able  to keep your cool and just be a  bunch of old people from the  greatest generation that's  absolutely ridiculous and they just  fight for you and they just  fight for you yeah yeah they're like 
[01:53:00]  your proxy they just get on the phone  never  oh good night well you have a lot of  moxie don't you  my hands hurt  just finally i just get her out of  here  give him 10 percent i uh i just i  don't like going through the  bullshit you have to go through it  like like bill said you know  so they don't hang you upside down  and shake you down you it's your  burden of proof now you got to go 
[01:53:30]  up there they're the ones with all  the information you fuck up if you  if they fucked up and gave you extra  money that shit if you didn't spend  the money would be out of your  account immediately yeah if there's a  fuck up on their end i mean it's  gonna be that's gonna be foreign  business days yeah and we have to do  you have the form or the any record  of the i'm sorry sir this has to be  processed in saskatchewan  you're the bank you're the one with  all the paperwork and everything like  that why do i have to come up with 
[01:54:00]  shit and bring it to you it's in your  building somewhere or i understand i  understand that you're upset but this  is this is just you click  and you know what helps do in those  situations where i'm furious and i'll  say to the person look i know this i'm  not saying i know this is not your  fault this is not your doing a lot of  times that because they're a person  just being yelled at and they go no no  it is but i was the one personally  actually stealing from you yes you  caught me but i know that actually 
[01:54:30]  helps a lot because that makes the  person want to help you a little bit  more yeah because then they know  that it's being screamed at by some  maniac you're like they're like i  understand your frustration because  most of the people you're talking to  you're not talking to the head of the  bank that got the million dollar  bailout most people you talk to are  consumers like you are just working  and they do as much as they don't  want to help you they do understand  they've been in your shoes with  another company before yeah so if you  handle them right a lot of times  you'll get what you want without as  much hassle as you think my thing is is  if i know i'm already fucked then i  can give myself a halftime speech or 
[01:55:00]  pregame speech before i get in there  not to lose my ship i am so bad in the  moment i immediately go oh sir you  don't have the phone what the fuck  like i immediately and then by the  time by the time i calm down and then  try to go to root jim saying i'm just  like that so everybody already hates me  yeah yeah but there's a fear with it  though there's a fear and an  overwhelming feeling in something like  a bank it's like when you go to the  bank of america or chase it's like  this overwhelming i can't comprehend  how it works it's too big for me and it 
[01:55:30]  feels scary so i'm going in with a  weird i can't beat this it's like  fighting city hall yeah and i think  that somehow they're right deep down  i'm fucked up and it's beyond  control and i can never fix it i can  never get it back yeah and it's like  a lot of times you can it's not as  hard as you think because you're  dealing with just average fucking  dumb motherfuckers i was having a hard  time fucking like sleeping last night  because i kept popping in my head this  this fucking issue that i got to deal  with it becomes overwhelming but it's  not i'm like fuck man like but but it  is and and you know it could have been 
[01:56:00]  way worse oh oh i know it'd been way  i know but the thing is like i i i  know me and you go go back and forth  a lot but there's so many things i  really agree with you yes we realize  we're agreeing we've reached a point  where the people are aren't big enough  to do anything anymore about like it  used to be the old days the townsfolk  in fucking sleepy eye uh there were a  little house on the prairie people would  go to the bank they'd all get together 
[01:56:30]  and go hey is the bank uh treating you  like yeah yeah me too they're fucking  and they'd all march to the bank and  go hey asshole uh you're you're doing  this to all our people and they'd be  like all right now townsfolk settle down  we'll take care of the problem now we've  let it get to the point where you there's  no one no direct person of accountability  there's a board and there's not another  shareholders there's always this thing  this entity that has to be dealt with it's  like well we only answer to our 
[01:57:00]  shareholders well the board had to  discuss this and that and then be like  who's the what who's the guy and then  you realize there's not a guy it's a  thing yeah and and a person can't fight a  thing you just have to kind of go along  and then it become it became too big and  monolithic so so now you're just at its  mercy do you send emails if you go to a  corporation like that like any of them no  no that i i had one recently the  continental and i found out the emails  of the corporate officers and the 
[01:57:30]  president and you cc everybody and you  let them all see that you've cc'd the  other officers yeah and then they know  that everybody has read this and you  would be fucking surprised they always  get back to you they'll get back to you  but always the amount of shit that you  have to go through just for just yeah to  be treated like a human being that's the  thing i get indignant like i shouldn't  have to go through this and yes i i don't  know i i had one one time when they  charged me like like thirty dollars to  check a bag and then they end up i stood 
[01:58:00]  downstairs for like i don't know for like  an hour and a half before the thing  finally came out because they run a  skeleton crew on sundays or some shit so  there's like four guys unloading like  twenty planes so i walked in i said i  wanted a refund of course they couldn't  do it there i had to go through the  whole thing on the website and just for  some reason that day i was just determined  i was just like i'm not gonna stop i'm  following through i just felt like they  were in the ceiling watching me go  jesus christ this son of a bitch won't  quit he's not stopping let's give him  another hundred yards of shit let's see 
[01:58:30]  if he'll crawl through it he's still  crawling yeah why why would it cost you  the same amount of money for the shitty  service which by the way the thirty  dollars a bag thing is ridiculous  disgusting it's like what but but  shouldn't that service shouldn't that  price be based on the service now they  gotta come up they can't just be like  hey by the way we're just taking 30  bucks from you we're shaking you down  it doesn't matter if your bag comes out  within five minutes or or two hours it  doesn't come out at all yeah that's  what well that's why i try to go to  small businesses as much as you can 
[01:59:00]  because they're still gonna have that  the customer is always right yeah kind  of thing you find that when you when  you you got to go to somebody who  individually owns a business and what i  like about individually owned  businesses is there's a justice because  i'm not saying all individually owned  businesses are are great yeah but if  you walk in and they suck you're like  well fuck you i'm not coming back and  they go out of business but they can't  you know you can affect them you can't  say well go fuck yourself american  airlines they'll be like hey you know  whatever yeah whatever well we got 90  guys on standby yeah ah fuck bill burson 
[01:59:30]  all right that's mothball the planes  mothball the fleet we can't go on by  quitting the nfl i don't like my car i'm  going all right we got nine million  people take your spot if you have an  amex make sure you fucking change your  miles over too because a lot of times  with continental and they're not as  good with american airlines anymore  so i had a lot of miles that kenny told  me i had to do by september so check  your fucking credit cards you're going  to lose your miles really have amex  yeah make sure you put them in an  airline but it's a contract i guess 
[02:00:00]  that's running out i did i did that  with united united i'm not flying them  for years they called me up out of  nowhere i said i had like a certain  amount of days to use my miles oh  yeah united states for that right yes  so i called them up and i told them i  go i don't i don't like being  threatened that's what i said they  said what we're not threatening you  yes you are you're telling me that if  i don't use these miles by such and  such date i'm gonna lose them that's  i don't like being threatened i said  you know what take them take them now  i don't i don't you know just don't 
[02:00:30]  call me up and fucking send me a  letter threatening me yeah forcing me  to go to orlando or some shit that i  don't want to do does united miles  run out i think they do and now  continental is probably gonna have the  same thing i think united sucks i'm  sure any any way they could fuck you  over they all suck but they you can  never get the upgrades they just they  really are terrible at the miles it's  like they don't have those programs  if you're not going to honor them  when you think back in the the day of  the the pillow and the blanket they'd  bring you and it like flying was an  event it was like oh and and people 
[02:01:00]  dressed up the stewardesses stewardess  stewardess yeah yeah you could call  them stewardesses they were all girls  it wasn't some gay guy at the front of  the plane uh and and they were they  had little skirts on and they were there  at your beck and call with a smile and  shit and and now it's just they're  belligerent they don't want to fucking  be there and deal with it they're all  old bags because they couldn't fire  them because they got old listen to  this my my girl's mom used to used to  fly for uh pan am jesus pan america and 
[02:01:30]  she told the clip out of japan told me  in the 70s she was just telling these  like this stuff that you could like  people getting drunk and all this type  all these crazy stories and then she  said yeah like the mid 70s like and  she was she was probably like 25 prime  of her life they had hot pants with  basically you know the the hooker boots  on and she goes oh she goes we were  killing them when we were walking  through the airport i was just like  what when what happened in those days  just a fucking gaggle of sexy stews  walking through the airport what when 
[02:02:00]  when was stewardess when did that become  a like a like almost like a racial slur  yeah you're calling her cunt you might  as well just be calling her cunt what  what is wrong with the word stewardess  know where flight attendants because  stewardess became synonymous with the  short skirt the boots the fucking big  tits young girl that's just bending  over her ass is in the other guy's face  like next you'd go to the guy next to  you go could you order something so i  could see the girls i'll pay for it you 
[02:02:30]  know what's funny about that is they  just kept the stewardess is the same  way the price is right kept those three  girls yeah and so they became like 60  they just have the same stewardesses from  the 70s yeah but steward is not a taboo  word it is weird why that anything with  gender involvement it's gender involvement  waitress became they do it in comedy  clubs too uh your waitstaff server i'll be  your server nothing with gender you're a  waitress shut up unless it's a phony  empowerment yeah then they want to use 
[02:03:00]  gender it's the same way people use race  and religion when it's a phony empowerment  they're comfortable using it when it's  when it's anything that identifies their  job they think it's negative yeah that  had used to have men or man at the end  and and you'd have to put woman at the  end then then they i think i think i think  server is more condescending that's  somewhere between waitress and slave slave  yeah it's like a woman's i guarantee  somebody who goes to a columbia woman's  class woman empowerment would be  offended by the word stewardess yeah  meanwhile it's fine for you to be in a  fucking a gender obsessed yeah horse oh 
[02:03:30]  is this the one maggie yeah this this is  great turn the volume up on this uh go  go back to the beginning this is national  airlines one of their commercials from  the 70s  ultra swag oh i wish i'd lived back then  you did i'm maggie fly me to new york  you'll love my two 747s to kennedy fly me  you'll love my two 747s fly maggie and  maggie's like she did that sexy thing with  her head at the end it was all but like 
[02:04:00]  that was part of the fucking experience  how great would it be if the camera  pulled back and she was truncated she  had no arms or legs in a wheelchair  wouldn't that be the greatest commercial  of all time and you realize her body  was shaped like a plane  did you hear that right before you play  that guy i wish i lived back then and  norton goes you did  old enough to be able to do something  about that yeah i remember being a kid  like flying to california to see my dad  and shit like that and that's when i saw 
[02:04:30]  that kind of shit but uh it was something  to inspire to those people in first  class they were there was a party up  there it was a fucking and it was known  as a party now it's like that's why  first class became this thing that was  like whoa first class that's cool now  it's just all right i get a bigger seat  but i'm still dealing with fucking  assholes and and flight i was on there  one time and they do you know that shit  when you're you're in back with all the  animals and they uh they go we have a  limited amount of breakfasts we are  your choices today are an egg omelet or 
[02:05:00]  a handful of bran and you're like in  row 36 and everybody's like i'll have  the omelet i'll have the omelet i'll  have the omelet you're like you  motherfuckers and then somebody right  as it gets to your row they give out  the last fucking omelet they go all we  have left is a handful of bran right  you're like and you live it so i'm in  first class and they did that they did  it in first class first they didn't  have it so they ran out of eggs so i  go i don't want anything and then  five minutes later stewardess comes  back with magically has eggs and i and  she goes yeah the pilot said you could 
[02:05:30]  have his eggs and i was like i don't  want his eggs pilot's fucking eggs yeah  i don't want i want my eggs let him  eat and by the by the way she's dizzy  up there she's probably lying by the  way she's there are probably eggs that  she wanted to eat and she fucking just  had to say the pilot gave him up  fucking this is you want to see about  how bad continental has gotten i was in  first and the same thing happened  they ran out of the meal i wanted and  now they sell food on the plane which i  kind of like because they have like  these really great snack packs for  like seven or eight bucks but it's  fucking good shit so you have a bunch 
[02:06:00]  of choices so i fucking said i don't  want anything let me have the snack pack  they fucking swipe my credit card for  eleven dollars you're in first class  they ran out of shit and then charged  you i said you ran out i'm like you  should be embarrassed i was so  aggravated she goes yeah i know and  then she had a male flight attendant  come with her to swipe the credit card  because i guess i was considered a  problem yeah exactly boy see and and  you know what they have complete  power over anybody that's even mad at  something like that because then it's  like well ladies and gentlemen we got to 
[02:06:30]  make an emergency or landing 9-11 9-11  because uh the guy's mad that he didn't  get his food he's he's out of control but  i fucking i fucking wrote my my email to  the head of fucking united for something  else that happened just sitting there in  between jerking off at his computer  waiting for his dick to get hard again  and he's like dear continental that made  my dick hard dear mr smizik whoa i  fucking me and kenny had used miles to  fly first we used like a hundred thousand  miles or whatever but it was a brand new 
[02:07:00]  plane and they hadn't installed the real  first class seats oh they were like  they were shitty and i didn't want to  pay full mileage for that i wanted some  miles back so i we went to this fucking  old twat in newark airport and she just  was not helpful at all and that's what  like bill said i was like i'm fucking  gonna crawl through this shit because i  could not stand that cunt's attitude  yeah and i got back miles and an  apology and then the next time it  happened with the fucking meal i was  given a two for free policy what i'm  learning listening to jim is you just  have to be that guy who's not going 
[02:07:30]  away just never not gonna curse not  gonna lose his temper but he will not i  am not going away you have to be  adamant like but without screaming and  human intuition they a lot of times  know you're right and when i had that  at&t thing i said to her the woman on  the phone who was nice i said i didn't  realize i had to check and make sure  that the phone company wasn't stealing  from me yeah i feel like i've been  stolen from when you start saying that  to them without cursing it gets a  reaction yeah he's good man he's got 
[02:08:00]  that is good what kind of way is that  to run a company i feel like i'm  unacceptable i'm being stolen from  but they're not yeah the more you deal  what kind of shenanigans is this sorry  there's no no they're so used to being  yelled at and screamed at and people  go what the fuck and people not being  prepared but if you're prepared and you  speak to them that way it doesn't always  work but it absolutely helps it a lot of  times they want to help you it annoys me  it annoys me to do that i don't want to 
[02:08:30]  have to do that technically i mean you  need to have credit but technically you  can keep all your money in a safe if  you want to you can do that i mean i  don't want to know i don't want to it  when something fucks up i don't want to  have to be on the phone first pushing a  thousand buttons useless fucking menus do  you do this operator please yes operator  please i'm sorry we did not understand  that and it's like that is you hit zero  that's not an option yet you know you 
[02:09:00]  know yet it should be in there because  they don't give you that operator one  until you run through all their other  shit while you wait let us tell you  about it's like really first of all you  could put me right through it's not  while i fucking wait you're you're  making me listen to a commercial now or  they do the thing like yeah you're  going to be your your phone call will  be answered in the order that it  appeared yeah your wait time in or you  can go right to online and have a deal  dealt with right now your wait time is  43 minutes yeah while you wait let us 
[02:09:30]  talk about some other shit you use the  fucking take the uh take the uh the  option for the survey too i find that  that i don't know if they know you do  it maybe i'm just convincing myself it's  gotten me better service but a lot of  times they'll say beforehand if you'd  like to take a survey after i would  always go no no but then all of a sudden  i'm realizing i don't know if the agent  knows that or not but if they do know  it they automatically know that you're  taking a survey about their service and  the companies do look at that shit just 
[02:10:00]  the way this fucking company  investigates every complaint that all  those companies do too i tell them  like uh by the way what's the uh what's  the menu prompt for uh the uh survey  because i would like to take one after  this uh is done i want to start  recording the phone calls too yeah and  tell us this is being recorded for  quality assurance i'm also recording  this phone call for quality assurance yeah  i'm having a backup i bluffed that bill  it didn't help i have bluffed that  though i'm recording as well they don't  give a fuck because they know they're  being taped i'll have your union card 
[02:10:30]  crammed in  oh it's infuriating you hear so many  stories about it and it really i think  part of it is my own fear of being  over this does not preclude uh wipe out  whatever the word their incompetence  their fucking thievery them being uh  despicable but a part of it got all the  words he does he's good man no no but  i mean i'm not disagreeing with bill  because they are disgusting and when  you see these i these fucking bank  heads are the most hateable people  but you just you just gave them three 
[02:11:00]  criticisms without dropping the f-bomb  like that's amazing that's like the  triple lindy for me yeah like they're  incompetent they're they're cunts like  i can't even get beyond one get one and  then just throw the fucking adam bomb  at them all right tag it with the f-word  this is fucking ridiculous i think i get so  condescending toward them too like they'll  they'll tell me something i don't want  to hear and i just start going oh  really really so that's what you're  going with here right really i get i go 
[02:11:30]  i go totally conspiracy theory i'm just  like you know why are you part of the  problem i'll do that yeah this is what  you dreamed about when you were a kid  this is what you wanted to do just steal  from people like this and then jimmy  looks like they have any sort of  decision making well that's what it is  jimmy looks at it like they're they're  not the people they're just the  working guys behind the scenes you  know doing that they're not the  scum ass but i look at it like you  know that scene in clerks when they're  talking about the death star and and  the workers that had to fix it and they  got blown up it's like well you know 
[02:12:00]  they chose to work for that company  they have to take the consequences of  me calling them fucking asshole  shithead fuck you right but the way  jimmy is looking at it with that you  have to have empathy for the guy and  you know what's the sad thing is is i  totally realize that and i still in i  am so bad and i go from if if i'm on  the phone and i discover that i'm being  fucked with there's no way i'll be able  to keep my cool if i discover i'm being  fucked with and i'm off the phone and 
[02:12:30]  i'll act like a fucking cage lion for  like 20 minutes in my living room  my dog's over in the corner shaking  like is it me is he mad at me what is  going on and then i calm down then i get  on the phone and and i and i have  patients like i don't know maybe for  for seven minutes speaker you i do put  on speakerphone it helps a little bit  like i have i have my fucking landline  it's holding the phone in your ear when  it starts to get hot and you want to  bite your fingers off it's sweating  your battery powers down to nothing  taking out or your call gets dropped 
[02:13:00]  put on a fucking landline and put on  the speakerphone i'm on my computer and  you can barely hear their shit music  when they come back pick it's almost  like i'm just doing my day while it  happens and believe me i fucking hate  them and i don't have as much empathy  as it is i know that they're my only  link like right now i can't get the  fucking the the director of the board  on the phone he's not coming to the  phone so this is who i have this is my  way in they can get me to a supervisor  they can eventually help me uh and back  to that fucking bank of america i had 
[02:13:30]  the bank president in there with me  trying to help me and he was genuine  and sincere probably the janitor  they're like dude you got to play the  president again yeah get out there we  got some fucking guy i even said that  to him i'm like i can't believe that  you were the bank president and you  mop and do the windows he's like yeah  i'm president but uh just him talking  to them on the phone too and he was  getting nowhere but when you start  saying stuff like that like uh that's  unacceptable and you just start being  adamant and i even said to them i'm not  paying a thousand dollars you're gonna 
[02:14:00]  pay you're eating this i'm not paying  for your incompetence yeah it's not  happening uh when you say that's good  right when you say it's not happening  paying for your incompetence and i did  say that steal that absolutely who  thinks like that who can say that  without dropping an f-bomb no because  i'm not fucking paying for your  goddamn fucking incompetence you cunts  i said what he said i did it was just  on steroids he's getting the money you're  getting a click but i knew i was right  i knew i was right and because they  said this was enraging this is why i was 
[02:14:30]  grateful the bank manager was cool  because i had gone in and there was a  bank employee that sat there with me  they call on the speakerphone and i got  my final mortgage payment and i paid  it three months later so i go back in  and the woman on the phone tells me and  the bank manager who i'm in with says  well there's no record of your mortgage  being closed out and then i started to  go into well uh thank god the employee  walked in and recognized me he goes oh  yeah i helped you last time i'm like  would you like me to bring the guy in  and he can tell you on speakerphone  don't expect me because your records are  not kept properly and you have to tell 
[02:15:00]  them you missed a mortgage payment oh  my second you missed it oh that would  be through all the system your credit  would be fucked and all that type of  thing fucking there a hundred percent  but you just have to be adamant and  again don't curse even though i want to  how about how about something going on  for years when uh and i've told this  story before but uh quickly i'll tell  it again thank you time sweetie i turned  in my vehicle after a three-year lease  uh payments made every month  automatically on time to send them a  little right up to the pillow whatever 
[02:15:30]  right up to the end of my lease i go to  a dealership i turn in my old vehicle i  lease a new vehicle there we go done ski  uh i get a notice like three months  later that my uh loan is in default um  they're repossessing uh my vehicle but it  was the vehicle i turned in i'm like what  the fuck so now i'm trying to just  kind of get on your silk pajamas  reading that you gotta be  my word you gotta be shitting me 
[02:16:00]  stocking cap you mother fucker yeah  it turns out the the dealership i i gave  my old vehicle to and got the new  vehicle from parked it in their storage  lot and never got it back to the  manufacturer or the deal wherever the  fuck they send your your done lease  right so i i call up and they were  like well we don't have any record of i go  do you honestly i go i go honestly do  you think i paid my lease off every 
[02:16:30]  month on time even the last payment paid  off the last payment and then decided to  just keep the vehicle and then you guys  gave me another one and you gave me  another one which i have right that i've  been paying on time but i kept the big  really really you mother fucker then  that's where i wait was there my mistake  was there because a lot of times what i  save everything like uh from from stuff  like when it says you paid your lease off  successfully or whatever it says yeah you  save that but they hadn't given you 
[02:17:00]  anything oh no oh okay no it was i had no i  had everything oh you did but it had  gotten to the credit reporting companies it  got to the three big three credit  reporting companies who then had me i i got  my credit reports and looked and had  repossession of a vehicle on there my  credit rating was shit and i had paid the  fucking and how long did it take you to  get that a year let a one fucking year  to get it off to it never got off the  third one as far as i know it's still  there on the one one of them they would 
[02:17:30]  not take the repo off why did you talk  to them yes and what was their answer  with they didn't have one when you say  did you i sent that they go what you  need to do is get a letter can you  general motors can you sue them for  everyone i'll sue you for ruining my  good name yes my good name i'm an  upstanding citizen i had to get a letter  from general they've heard i sue you  before oh i know bank of america here's  the language i use with them because i  said that i'm like i don't want to get  my attorney involved but i will oh i'm 
[02:18:00]  not paying this money so attorney i'll get  my attorney involved if you want to deal  with him because they've heard i'll sue  you that's reactionary i'll get my  attorney involved he's unbelievable that  is good joe jim you should get with  seminar you should every angry cunt  yeah out there and believe me i i  have the same i have the same hatred  and the same anger for them i don't  want to interrupt but to say sue you  they've heard i don't want to get my  attorney involved i will it's perfect  that's like the you complete me yes  phone calls to scumbags that's that  gives you the it's chinatown right 
[02:18:30]  there i do sometimes none of this works  by the way i i know sometimes none of  this works that's gotta be infuriating  when it doesn't work because then you  just go fucking content hang up on  them i had to get a letter from  general motors three of them to send  off to the three credit reporting  companies uh stating that i did  indeed pay my debt in full on time and  that that the the fact that they didn't  get the thing back had nothing to do  with me i gave it to the credit  reporting companies two of them it was  wiped clean fucking disappeared uh it 
[02:19:00]  did you had to cancel checks and all  that i'm gonna cancel check the other  everything and the one credit reporting  company they just never took it off i  sent in the letter i sent them  everything and they said oh we got that  we gotta go it's not off okay well  yeah we're gonna work it was always  they're gonna work on it how long did  you stick with them a year do you get  names one fucking year you finally said  fuck it i finally said fuck it do you  get names who you talk to every time  you gotta get names he's right first 
[02:19:30]  thing you do jim norton seminar first  thing you do i write down uh uh to who  am i speaking to please they understand  why so and so i write down the name and  the time it sounds crazy but this the  next person you talk to because you  will have to call again look i spoke to  uh to bill tetley at five at 5 50 p.m  why is this not been handled this is who  i spoke to and when you get a list of  names you still have to make the calls  but it helps a lot because they know  that you're legitimate and they know  you're fucking you're you're prepared 
[02:20:00]  yeah but when you're just screaming  anonymously into a fan i love screaming  anonymously fucking names yeah that's  how i screwed up with my cable company  yeah they had uh my internet just craps  out on me like every three days i always  gotta i always gotta sit there and you  know reset the thing and just and i just  would always deal with it like it doesn't  work in my bedroom you know my wireless  doesn't work in there and i just i'm just  not a guy who fucking is i'm not 
[02:20:30]  traveling i don't have fucking time yeah  so i called like every you know it gets  when it gets absolutely ridiculous i will  call so finally like for the sixth time  that year i have to call up and i'm  flipping i've called like six times well  who did you talk to we don't have any  record of it i go do you think i'm just  like making this up yeah i'm lying you're  right yeah i'm not trying to get any  money out of you guys i just want this  this thing fixed and blah blah blah blah  and they go sir we keep impeccable  records here and i go and what what is  what what do you just say you keep  impeccable records so therefore you do  i also keep impeccable records 
[02:21:00]  right up here in my brain  they didn't want to hear that yeah  who did you talk with sir i don't know  well then  well i can't help you so you're saying  because i didn't get the person's name  now you're telling me  that the phone call didn't happen so  you're basically saying that i'm lying to  you yeah you're they're calling you a  liar keep the bill in front of you and  if it's a bill  you write down on the the problem bill  who you spoke to  and it's almost like you feel like  you're getting something done when you  do you have a rosary too  he's crazy  do you eat those candies with like the 
[02:21:30]  jelly in them do you have like the  patience of an 85 year old woman  i'm not patient  he's sucking on a werther's while he's  waiting  dude  i blew a fucking three-point lead in  chess and fucking friends with chess  and i bit my fucking arm so bad i  almost like i'm going to the hospital  i don't have patience but you feel  like you're accomplishing something  yeah it's almost like it's a tangible  thing  like it's not as frustrating  in his housecoat with a girdle  big fuzzy slippers  i'd like to talk to the man in charge 
[02:22:00]  and you know what you say you feel  like you're accomplishing something  when you think about it too much  though you realize what you've  accomplished is getting back to square  one  you're you're where you were supposed  to be in the first fucking place  sometimes accomplish anything you  just got back what the fuck you were  fucked out of but i've almost always  part of you know part of the problem  is that we get so like as much as  technology is a pain in the ass it  spoils you  and i forget to check like this i  don't always check it's like part of  it is my responsibility because years  ago you went over a checkbook you 
[02:22:30]  went over my mother would go over  meticulously and subtract and do  everything and she knew exactly what  we had in the bank checkbook you  don't do that anymore no so if i did  that every month if i went over my  checks which the bank gives me a  thing to go over my checks if i did  that system but with the technology  i've gotten lazy so part of it is i  don't check my own shit either yeah  how hard was it to get caught  fucking around with your taxes back  in the day whenever you had a ledger  the ledger yeah now they can just  break into your computer and see  exactly what you're doing but back 
[02:23:00]  then you know you're like like dusting  two sets of books you know you got  two of them yeah i'll take one over  there and the only thing you had to do  the other the other one was like in a  different closet down the hall yeah  like same house yeah how are they  gonna find it you want to you really  want to dig through my entire house  from my other ledger ah well i guess  he's on the up and up do you know in  facebook this big lawsuit that's going  on it's like a 50 billion dollar lawsuit  or 25 billion they're going over the  computers of the one guy and they're  doing forensics on the computers because 
[02:23:30]  it's 25 billion dollars at stake and  they said they found on one of the  guys computers a contract like they've  been deleted encrypted that was signed a  certain way and they think that they  might have got it's amazing what they  can do when they want you know they're  using every bit of technology now you're  25 billion dollar i'm gonna sound a  little like bill here you know that the  computer companies with that delete and  shit like that they know it's not  deleting anything even the the programs  that you buy that supposedly wipe clean 
[02:24:00]  the the programs and and and files yeah  why can't you do that why does  everything get stained always find your  hard drive yeah it's like nothing it's  once it whatever you did it's there  it's there it's pieces of it are there  enough to put together the puzzle you  know but but like those shenanigans  that like they're not in cahoots yeah  this guy just shooting a fucking ak-47  at the side of a toyota prius i  actually have that it's an mp5  that's a look at them oh i got that

[02:32:30]  Hi, O.P. and Anthony Show  Bill Burr  That was a great read, by the way, Anthony  Oh, thanks, yeah, yeah  I put a lot of effort into my reads  My live reads  Thank you, Bill  I was in the turlet  I had to make wee-wees and blow my nose  Yeah, we wanted to talk about animals  Because we were watching a little kid  I guess in, what was he, shark fishing or some shit?  In the Gulf  And the fishing technology with the rod and reel is so good 
[02:33:00]  That this, like, nine-year-old kid reeled in a seven-foot shark  Yeah, never would have been able to do that in the old days  With a shitty little reel  Oh, yeah, with your worm on the end of it  Pocket fisherman  The Popeil pocket fisherman  Would have yanked him right in  Yeah, so we actually started talking about  I was like, I couldn't do that  If you had a shark sushi roll  I could eat that  You're all in on that  But I could never be  I couldn't kill something like that  But a chicken  I could kill a chicken  You could kill a chicken  With your bare hands? 
[02:33:30]  I could do that  I'd grab him  Like, if I was hungry enough  After a while  It would take me a couple days of hunger  Alright?  If I had no water or anything like that  I would immediately become cranky within four hours  And I would grab him by his chicken face  And I would do that thing  Where you act like you're starting up an old car  You're cranky  Yeah, you're cranky  And his neck just snaps  His neck snaps, yeah  I've seen him do that  And I've seen him do the bullwhip thing  Where they kind of take the chicken by the head  The feet  The face  Oh  By his face, like you said  And then they do like a  Like you're cracking the whip with him 
[02:34:00]  And his neck just snaps  I could do that  And that's over  Now, but the thing is  Like you're saying  After you're hungry  I would look the other way  But it would be one of those things  After I did it the first time  Yeah  I would be  I would  Think you'd be desensitized  Yeah, an open Pandora's box  Fucking bite his throat open with your teeth  It's like a serial killer  With your first kill  Yeah, yeah  The first kill's the hard one  Yeah  And then it just gets easier  What about a deer?  With all your guns  Could you shoot a deer?  No  No, I'm not a hunter  I like shooting  Could you shoot a person 
[02:34:30]  Or a deer?  If you had to choose  Well, it would have to be a bad person  You know  You know what?  I'm fucking with your gun license here  I'm sorry  No, you're not  I'm asking you dumb questions here  You're actually not  Is there anybody in your neighborhood  You want to just wave your gun at Anthony?  I'm not a hunter  So I don't like  I always get  You get this weird death feeling  When you kill something  Like some people love it  And they're like  Yeah, I got a big deer  I'm all fine with that 
[02:35:00]  I'm not anti-hunting  Go ahead  Hunt your bulls up  Have fun  But  I don't know  Even when I was a kid  I would hunt like rabbit  You'd shoot a rabbit  And then  Like you're skinning it  And you're kind of like  You know something died  Yeah  You just have some death  Some looming death feel over you  Yeah  Yeah  And you have all these cereal in the cupboard  Yeah  It's like  I could have eaten like a fucking burger  I'll tell you what I'm doing  I love watching those  Those redneck things  Where they shoot those wild boars 
[02:35:30]  Oh yeah, yeah  Dude, they're gigantic  I know  I want to run through this building doing that  Dude, this one takes like fucking nine shots  It just keeps getting hit  Going  And just keeps going  I like how the hunters a lot of times will say though too  Like, hey, that thing will come at you  They're fucking nasty  You gotta watch the  It's like, really?  If you weren't there  If you weren't shooting at it  But it wasn't gonna come at you  But again, I could give a shit  You know 
[02:36:00]  I don't mind people hunting  That's  It's gotta be fun  If you don't mind killing things  How much fun is that?  Something's moving around  And you gotta shoot it  I hate it  It's fucking hard  It's gonna be great to do  If you didn't mind  It all sounds great  Until I watch them do it  Like when they  Oh, there you go  There's an  Oh, Jesus Christ  Wow  He stopped that fucking thing  Dead in its tracks  Wow, did he blast that thing  Yeah  If you get the audio on  You gotta see  This might be the one  Oh, that one he hit 
[02:36:30]  Awesome kill shots  I get that one  It's called Awesome Kill Shots  Why doesn't he just go home  And fuck his wife?  Why don't you do that?  Because she looks like  What he's shooting at  He's probably right  He's shooting her by proxy  This fucking asshole  With his camouflage jacket  How much can you stack the deck?  You're blending in  And you have a gun  Fucking coward  Yeah, but look at the degree  Of difficulty  Through those trees  Yeah, that is tough  Oh, no 
[02:37:00]  Good  Come on  I can't even get  Come on  Two shots  Come on  Is that a revolutionary  War gun?  They got some nice  Etching on their  Weapons  They take them  Very seriously  Oh, look at that  Is that Galifianakis?  Wow  Are they gonna eat  Everything they fucking hunt?  I don't know  Probably not the tusk  But I mean  Do they eat wild war?  Got them marinated  For a while  Oh, yeah  Oh, okay  They probably make some  Good bacon out of that 
[02:37:30]  There is an adrenaline rush  There's a thing  Like, I have hunted  But I don't like  I don't like killing things  Fuck that  But there is like  An adrenaline rush thing  That happens  Because it takes a long time  To find something  If you're real hunting  Not fucking going out  On some game reserve  When you had to do that  To survive  That must have been  The greatest  Right  Feeling ever  Yeah  I'm gonna eat  Yeah, hey  Yay, I get food  Yay  But, oh, man  They sure are dusty animals 
[02:38:00]  When they hit them  Dust blows off of them  Very dirty  Those pigs  Fucking things  Just running through the woods  Minding his business  Yeah, I think they get  Dogs chasing him, too  Of course  Why wouldn't you?  They feel like some dogs  Chase him around  Why'd they shoot the dogs?  Oh, no, that's right  They're dogs  They pat him on the head  And go, good boy  Good boy  Oh, the trailer  Oh, boy  Boy, this guy loves  Killing things  I have such a hatred  For this guy  This guy loves 
[02:38:30]  Killing animals  I really don't like him  Bolt action, too  You gotta give it to him  He's not fucking  He's not using  Some semi-automatic  Fucking rifle there  That's great  Takes a little bit of skill  Be able to get off  Three shots with a bolt action  No, no, no, no  According to everyone  It's an impossible shot  Really?  I saw the same movie  You did, asshole  And this guy's  Shooting at a running pig  With a bolt action  Jesus  Come on  Oh, would that go through  The tree and fucking hit him? 
[02:39:00]  This guy using a howitzer?  Yeah  You know what it is, though?  You know that's good eats, though  Yeah, I guess if you eat it, that's fine  Fucking boar bacon must taste like  It's gotta be wonderful  Do you think so?  I bet  Probably good, yeah  It's probably really good  Fucking pig  Did I tell you when I was up in Montreal  I was with Bobby and  I like that this is a natural segue  I know  No  We ate a pig's head  What?  I had a pig's head  It was fucking disgusting 
[02:39:30]  Really?  Well  There's some kid doing a blog  Who like  He's only eating like  Five different foods his whole life  He's totally picky  And he's trying to expand  His palate  So  Yeah  You know, as far as the comedy  You know, he picked the most fucked up thing ever  A pig head  Bobby dove in  He ate the fucking eyeball  Part of the snout  He ate the ear  But it was a mirror  He's doing his hair  I get it, dude  Because I'm fat  Exactly  Those pigs, when they're shot 
[02:40:00]  They should do that funny rolly over thing  Their legs go stiff  And they roll  Rolly over  Roly poly  It's like  It's like silent film actors  Yeah  Pretending to die  I'll tell you something  That's a tough fucking shot  They're running balls out  The guy's got  What amounts to a red dot  It's not even like a really  A magnified scope on the thing  And a bolt action  Shoot the cat 
[02:40:30]  Why a bolt action, you think?  I don't know  I think he wants to  Put a little  Put a little bit of skill into it  He's  What was that last thing he shot at?  I don't know  It looked like a fox or something  Yeah, a house cat  Maybe he should  A house cat  Maybe he shouldn't shoot that  I don't think he could eat that shit  But deer are like  Deer is a weird thing to hunt  Because they're not running  You sit there and wait for the deer to come up  And kind of stand there  He looks up majestically  And you fucking blow his neck out  But the pigs 
[02:41:00]  Wow, they're fucking  They're flying  Yeah  And this guy's got to lead them  And fucking shoot  Like a bolt action  Yeah  Travis, you want to let's go  That takes some skill  I'll give it to those guys  Mick Foley is arriving  Mick Foley is here  From the  What's he from now?  World of stand-up comedy  Oh, right  Okay  What's Roland doing?  You want to take a break real quick?  Oh  Should we catch up?  Oh, we did  Yeah, but we went an hour and 45 
[02:41:30]  We were doing that to catch up  Because we went an hour and 45  So we were going to take a break  Right before Mick  Sits down  It's pretty clean-shaven  What a head of hair  Mick's got on  Oh, my God  That looks great, man  Lost a bunch of weight  Mick, take a seat  You know what?  We're going to take a quick break  Catch up on commercial breaks  Because we gave you guys  So much quality radio  Yeah  And we'll be right back  Sirius XM  The virus  The Opie and Anthony show  Ah, yes 
[02:42:00]  We're back  And joined by Mick Foley  Hello  My God  It's been too long  Spent a long time  And you guys did right by me  The last time  Did we?  I always think like  Oh, God  What did we do to Mick last time?  Ginger Lynn had an orgasm on my knee  That's right  I was going to say  Last time I saw Mick  I remember that  That was a good one  Yeah  Oh, good  And here's the bizarre thing  I went right from here 
[02:42:30]  To going to OutQ Radio  And taping this very sensitive promo  Yes  For an anti-bullying campaign  The Gay Channel  Exactly  They'd been influenced  And I had to talk with them  A couple weeks earlier  And they asked me  If I minded  If they used our conversation  Like as the building block  For this anti-bullying campaign  So I went right from Ginger Lynn  Having the orgasm on my knee  To doing the sensitive  Anti-bullying campaign  And it wasn't until  I left the building 
[02:43:00]  That I asked myself  Was that wrong?  Was I wrong there?  No, because you didn't bully her  Into having an orgasm on your knee  No  Yeah, she loved it  And it was my suggestion  And in my defense  You know  She was looking a little uncomfortable  And you guys were suggesting  Different objects  That she might  That always happens  Yeah, I remember that  And so I felt like  I was the cavalry  Riding to the rescue  With that suggestion  You were  That wasn't a near bullying  You saved her  Do you know how many guys 
[02:43:30]  Would have offered up their knee  In that situation?  Yes  Or chin  You're a hero  You're a hero  My wife thought  It was a good decision  Oh yeah?  She liked it  Yeah, because you were  A little worried about that  How'd that work out  When you got home?  You know what?  I have an ironclad defense  What happened?  It was an ironclad  Ironclad defense  I just say  I've had head injuries  That's true  We've seen them  They're on video  You could watch him  Receiving head injuries  I busted my butt  For 23 years 
[02:44:00]  To put a roof over  These kids' heads  To put food on their table  Wow, that's good  He's got a great experience  He just has that match  With the Undertaker  On the loop  That's all  He's flying  From the top of that cage  And then he just walks away  Going, for you  One of the best ones  I did it for you  What was the date there, Sam?  What was the date?  I know  It was Hell in a Cell  It was June  1999  That's good  Bandwagon fan  98  98  Third week of June  Okay  June  I'll still give it to you 
[02:44:30]  It was the day in June  That Superfly Snooker  Came off the cage  Against Bob Backlund  Okay  Superfly  One of those great  Wrestling moments  What year is that?  That was 82  Wow  Yep  Okay  I loved Superfly  When he was in here  Doing the promo for us  Hey, can I tell you  A quick Superfly  Quick Superfly story  And I'm going to  Substitute one verb  For another one  I mean, it's the F'd up  So if someone wants to  You know  Are we allowed to say that?  Yeah  Yeah, of course  All right, okay  I'm going to go to Sam 
[02:45:00]  Sam, may you drop  The F-bomb for me?  Fuck  Yeah  Okay, yeah  So I would say  Messed  And then you  You throw in the other one  Okay  Okay  When Superfly  This is coming from  The Rock  Who does an amazing  Superfly impression  He said that  When Superfly  Was let go  By WWE  At the peak  Of his popularity  Giving you some indication  Of how messed up  He may have been  He would actually show up  And be in the main event  And he'd look outside  The window  And say to his driver  Not tonight, brother 
[02:45:30]  Look at the building  Lines going around the block  And take off  As he wasn't in the mood  To wrestle  Not tonight, brother  He went to  AWA  The American Wrestling Association  And Vern Gagne  Was having a conversation  With his son, Greg  Who said  You know  Dad, I don't know  The guy's kind of messed up  Fucked up  Right, guy's kind of  Fucked  Yeah  And the Superfly  Heard it  And he goes  You think  The Superfly  Is  Fucked up  You think  The Superfly  Is  Fucked up  And then the Superfly  Went into a toilet stall 
[02:46:00]  Where you  Heard the sound  Of like  A hand  Chopping  Followed by  Loud  Loud  Inhaling  And then he came out  And his eyes  Were all ablaze  He goes  Now  The Superfly  Is  Fucked up  There you go  Wow  Would he really say  Not tonight, brother?  Not tonight  The Rock  Doing pretty well  Not tonight, brother  That's fantastic  That Superfly  Was  Fucked up 
[02:46:30]  He was  Yeah  That would explain  Why when he came back  To WWE  He wasn't exactly  A main eventer anymore  Yeah  I mean  I just saw him  I saw him at the  Gathering of the Juggalos  He was  I think he was 69  Is he 69 years old?  69 years old  How does he look?  It's gonna be rough  You know he looks  Better than I do  Like  Come on  He's got that look  Of a guy  He was ripped  Yeah  You uh  Actually when he came in  We were commenting  How nice and clean cut  You look  Yeah  Your hair  Looks really nice 
[02:47:00]  And well kemped  You're shaved  All nicely  What's going on?  Celebrity wife swap  What?  Celebrity wife swap  I was like  I don't know  You know  I might put my  My marriage  Under a lot of strain  But uh  I'll do it for a free haircut  So what was the haircut thing?  Did the other wife  Tell you to do it?  Her rules  She suggested I do a makeover  And uh  She was like a Bob Seger fan?  I'm joking 
[02:47:30]  You look great  You look great  Oh man  You know  I'm joking  You look great  You look great  What I said to the boroughs  I still want it long enough  So that when most people look at it  They're like  Yeah he's kinda got long hair  Yeah  It's not all gone  But I mean  They took off  They took off 10 inches  They must have  Yeah  And I made the  You know  The donation to women  Who've  You know  I gotta get my little  Of course you do  That's fine  You do  You do a lot of great  Charitable work  He does  Yeah 
[02:48:00]  But I said no to the pedicure  The manicure  I went for the  They got me a set of front teeth  And then when I came home  Even my kids were like  Dad I have no respect for you now  Oh shit  And the story on the front teeth  Is I used to wear them in 1990  And then I met my wife  And she's like  Why do you wear those things?  I said I don't know  You know  It's like a stereotype  The wrestler with the missing teeth  She said  I think you look sexy without them  And the teeth  Literally went out of my mouth  And into the car ashtray 
[02:48:30]  And they stayed there  For many  I would just  I would put them in  When we were arguing  That was like  Kind of an annoyer  Yeah  So I got  Yeah I had the makeover  And they said  I was the only guy  That season  Who was undergoing  A drastic transformation  And if you guys remember  The beard was gray  The beard was graying  And I thought  I can't dye my beard  Like that's  You know  With the fans  That would be right below  Fixing the teeth  And getting a new ear put on  You know  Dying the beard  Yeah yeah  But now my excuse is 
[02:49:00]  It was for a television show  Television  Television  You know  It's for television  Had to do it  Who'd your wife swap with?  You know  I don't think I'm at liberty  To  Oh you know  Let's say  I don't think I'm supposed to  Even say that I'm on the show  Well it's kind of cool  That you did say that  But  You know what  It's only going to do good  For the show  The producers are like  I'm not saying  You should talk about it  Officially we can't say that  Right  But if you happen to mention it  It puts pressure on ABC  To actually air the episode  See  But they wanted 
[02:49:30]  They wanted opposites  So I mean  She went with  You know  An unbelievably good looking guy  You know  You know  Former Calvin Klein model  With the abs  And  Jesus  And it just so happened  That when  When the new wife came in  Our little puppy  Randall had the runs  And my agreement  With my wife  Was alright  You can get the dog  But I'm not  I'm not cleaning up poop  And so  She came at a good time  When there was  You know  Dog poop  Literally  Everywhere  How  Now let me ask you a question 
[02:50:00]  With a show like that  How much time  Do you actually  Or do the people  Spend with each other's wives  You know  It's like five days  They claim it's a week  But  Where do you sleep  You know  She sleeps  I can't tell you for sure  Where my wife's  But  Our woman  Had the spare bedroom  They don't sleep together  No  What's a wife swap  That stinks  They can't call it  Wife swap  It's the other parts  Of the marriage  In order to accurately  Depict life with  Life with me 
[02:50:30]  She slept in a different  Bedroom  Oh  I like that  Jim's going  The woman was great  She was a sweetheart  I was afraid  When I heard  She was really conservative  That it was going to be  Like a Fox News anchor  That I was going to  Really butt heads with her  Yeah  She just  You know  She believed in  Keeping the house  You know  Run finely tuned  And we're a little more  Freewheeling  Yeah  In the Foley house  You kind of grab  Whatever bed is available  And since I'm up  Until four or five  In the morning  You know  She would come in  And she would see me  Sprawled out  In a kid's bunk bed  You know  And even though 
[02:51:00]  My wife was gone  You know  The little kids  They fall asleep  You know  They go to sleep  And you know  And you know  They hang out  With their older daughter  And it just  Some people find it appalling  You know  I find it kind of  You know  Kind of endearing  I like that Jim  Thought that this ABC show  Was just a show about  Guys banging each other's  Wines  Swingers  I knew that you didn't  But I'm like  Why would you sleep  And step  If you're going to do it  Like make them sleep together  And fight the temptation  You know  Apparently I make noises 
[02:51:30]  When I sleep  I think there could be  A problem too  With like  You know  Husbands killing  The other guy  And  They wouldn't sign up for it  They're going to kill the other guy  There is a future  There is a celebrity swinger show  Waiting to happen  Yeah  There is  I'm not  Celebrity couples  You got to go non-celebrity  That's what you have to do  You got to go  First regular  Okay  Let's put it together  Let's do the pitch here  You get like  You get some couples  Who are just unhappy  In their marriages 
[02:52:00]  You get them to switch  But they're not allowed to bang  You got to be something  There's got to be some sort of  Immunity in there  Isn't there  Yeah there's always got to be  Some kind of immunity  I don't know how to do it  Give up on the cops  Stick them on an island  Stick them on  I thought you guys were all  Going to jump in  That felt like a real TV pitch to me  You guys were all the executives  Just going  I don't see it  And we're like  Yeah  Can I walk out of the room now  What's left of my dignity  Have you ever had a bad pitch  I've had a couple  Oh my god  That's awful  I actually know the signs  When somebody starts like 
[02:52:30]  Staring at their pen  Like playing with the pen  Looking out the window  Oh it's bad  Yeah that's  Do you remember CBS back in the day  I never pitched it  Oh my god  It was like walking into that fucking  The commissioner's office in the natural  It was like no lights on  And it was just  It was unbelievably  It was notoriously a cold room  And you would go  It was like doing the Apollo  You just went in and tried to survive it  Yeah  Oh wow  So my dad was crazy  And I thought  Who here is a pitch to show  I'm asking for a show of hands  On radio  I haven't yet pitched the show 
[02:53:00]  You know what's amazing  Is that it really doesn't matter  How good the show  It's how good you make it sound  While you're in there  It's all in the pitch  There is a trick to the pitch  Yeah  And apparently we don't know it  I obviously fucking don't know it  It's about me  The guy that you've never been interested in  Now you should be  This show is like me meets me  Yeah  Wow that sounds fascinating  Yeah there's a  I always throw  I always try to make it like too  Too different 
[02:53:30]  You know there's a neighbor  He's a rapist  But you don't understand  He's different now  It's not like it  But he's not good at it  He never quite gets to do it  You can't close the deal  See I know the standards  But he's likable too  Because he goes to hit them with a brick  And he just can't do it  And he lets them go  I always fucking foul up the pitch  How's stand up by the way  Are you liking it?  You know what?  I am  I just tagged along with Judah Friedlander last night  Did my first multi-club hopping deal  You guys should be on the Handsome Tour together  Judah's a pisser 
[02:54:00]  He's great  Judah's great  And every club  You want to go first?  You want to go after me?  And I'm like  I'm not  It's like in wrestling  I'm not following Judah Friedlander  Tonight I'm doing my own show at the brokerage  Largely so I can get some quality videotape  Because I find  I relate everything to wrestling  Yeah  You know  It's like  I talk about these AWA guys  For the casual fan  Who would tune in  And watch their horribly produced show  They just automatically surmise  That everybody on the show sucked too 
[02:54:30]  Right  And it's really the video quality  And so I've been tweeting out these couple of handheld things  Because my big challenge was people say  Really?  Even you guys  Like I would come in  And from time to time  Be fairly entertaining here  And then you guys  Really?  Comedy?  I don't see that  Comedy, no  Comedy, no  Yeah, that's  Awesome  The thing is  People  Okay  I said you know you're making a mistake  All right  Yeah  The voice goes off  No, that's a great idea  Does it make you happy?  Yeah, that's good 
[02:55:00]  The people have come on the show and been very funny  But couldn't possibly do stand-up  That's why I think the  Hell yeah, yeah  Because it's  There's a whole different thing between just being funny  And getting up on stage with a microphone  And making people fucking laugh  Right  And it's funny  You know when I used to talk to colleges  You could tell stories that were humorous  And if people laughed  It was like the icing on the cake  That's extra  Yeah, you're just telling the story  But it's a lot of pressure  Especially you know  Judas went and saw me one time  Where I came out of the  I was at a thing 
[02:55:30]  You know benefit show for the troops  I didn't know if I was doing a set  And this is at the Broadway  Where they have like 15 comics on  And they were all talking about masturbating  And like that was going to be my set  Oh shit  And so I'm sitting there in the front row  Like okay what do I do if I'm called  Hold on, I can't talk about masturbating anymore  And so I went up there  You know here's a showcase  Where guys have been on TV  And had you know  Actually performed around the country  And I go up there and wing a set  After coming out of the front row  And it was not you know  It was not pretty  At one point I actually said 
[02:56:00]  Look if I was in a pool  I would ask for a life preserver  Because I'm just  And so after that point  I really started writing ideas down  In wrestling  You know you go out there  You have a couple ideas  At least that's the way I did it  And boom you put it out there  And hopefully it's good  Hopefully it's impactful  But then you never touch it again  Whereas in comedy  You know what I'm seeing is  If you have something  You go out there  You try it out  You figure out how you can make it better  Whittle down the bad stuff  Keep the interesting stuff  So it's 
[02:56:30]  I really  I mean I don't mean to get  You know corny  About respecting the craft  And all that  It's true though  But you're asking the right question  You're sitting there going  Alright I can't do that  You know  Because those guys have done that  And then when you started bombing  You did the best thing  You addressed it  Addressed the bomb  The worst is to just keep plowing through  As people are just going like  Oh my god does he know  This is horrible  You gotta acknowledge it  That's if you have a polite crowd  If they're a mean crowd  They'll just start laughing at you  Oh and I know  Because I did the virus  And I thought I'd  Put in my own five minutes of stand up 
[02:57:00]  It was the most uncomfortable feeling  Of the world  It's so fucking hard  I don't know how  Like just to have the balls  To get up there and do it  Is amazing to me  But I was used to people  Automatically liking me  Right  And cutting me that slack  And sometimes I'd go out there  In front of 15,000 people  And bomb on purpose  Just so I could get a rise  Out of like Jericho in the back  And be like  You actually did it  You did it  Look at you  You bombed  It was hilarious  Yeah  And it's  You don't get the same grace  You know  You don't get that same slack 
[02:57:30]  From the stand up audience  No  But I'm plugging away  I'm really  I'm going to give it  At least a year or two  And really pursue it  And I  You know  If I could ever open  For either you gentlemen  I would consider it an honor  So  Do you  Let me ask you  Do you go on the show  By yourself  Are you having other acts  On the show  Or is it just you  For an hour and a half  Or how does your show work  It depends  If I'm being booked  Like in Plattsburgh, New York  They'll find a local comic  To open up 
[02:58:00]  And then I'll go on  And I'll do it for a while  If it's a wrestling audience  Then I can kind of  I'm trying to find out  Like how can you  Go out there  And please everybody  And not essentially  Be Mick Jagger  On a solo tour  Refusing to play  Stone songs  So I try to find  Wrestling stories  As a jumping off point  And then try to make it  I try to make it  So that anybody can enjoy it  But so that wrestling fans  Don't feel like  I'm excluding them  Like you've totally  Given up on that  And won't even  Acknowledge your  Wrestling career  I tried that in 2003 
[02:58:30]  When I had my first novel  I was like  I'm a writer now  Yeah  And one person  Came to my  My book signing  Who was not a wrestling fan  Like the entire tour  Wow  One person  And I asked her  Like oh  What do you think  About wrestling  And she was like  I don't watch wrestling  I said well  Why are you here  I think you're  A wonderful writer  I was like  Whoa  Damn  So we're talking  And then he choked her out  I've got to get back  In the good graces  At WWE 
[02:59:00]  Just so they can  Put my appearances  On their website  Because that drives  Like 90%  Of the audience  Right  Oh yeah  Do you host the shows  Mick  Do you go out first  And host  I've never hosted  I would like to  I mean I'm open  To doing anything  Last night  When I was tagging  Along with Jude  I was doing  The five minute sets  Which are hard for me  Because my stuff  You know  It's not  Bing bang boom  It's kind of storytelling  But by the time  I did my fourth club  I was like  Okay I get  I get this  You kind of have  To get into it  And you know  And out of it  Fairly quickly 
[02:59:30]  But guys would tell me  When I was rambling  On for an hour  That you know  You need to  Whittle this stuff down  In case you get  The call for  You know  If a TV show  Comes up  You can't go out  There with these  Long meandering  Stories  And then  We hit  2001  When I  Oh gosh  When you're telling  A story  And you gotta do that  So then  I learned  The curse word  And I haven't done this  As soon as a comic  Goes anyway  You know  They have no idea 
[03:00:00]  What they're doing  Just bombed  Yeah exactly  So what else  Is going on  Is another one  Shit is crazy  That's the black version  Of the white  So what else  Is going on  Shit is crazy  And Adam Ferrara  Should never go up there  And say  I know what you're thinking  Like you know  That's  You know  A heavy guy  Goes up there  I know what you're thinking  I know what you're thinking  Ah yeah  I like to eat  I don't  Okay  Yeah that does seem  Well you should just say  Something that you know  They're not thinking  That's what it's  Like I know what you're thinking 
[03:00:30]  Suicide bombings are funny  What  No we're not  Wait a minute  You're going to throw them  For a loop  I don't know  For a second  Dude  Everybody in the 90's  That I opened for  Seemed to have that  When I used to do  All those gigs  They go  I know what you're thinking  Oh god yeah  I did it  Yeah  When did Jimmy Carter  Open a fruit stand  That's good though  That's good stuff  I mean I don't even know  What the fuck  It was always like  You looked at like  You looked like two people  Yeah  For me it was 
[03:01:00]  Sinead O'Connor  And Doogie Howser  I started like in 1990  I would say that  And then Sinead O'Connor  And Uncle Fester  I don't know if I ever did  On Crack or On Hell  I don't know if I ever did those  On Crack  I don't know if  On Crack or From Hell  I don't think I've ever done those  You shouldn't  No  You shouldn't do those  Last time I was on  I said I fucked a pregnant woman  Who was on crack  Because that was true  That made sense  Well that's funny  Sorry  You mentioned  Off air  That you had actually  Done a cruise  You'd done Shane McMahon's  Like his engagement 
[03:01:30]  Bachelor party  His bachelor party  Yeah me and Bob Levy  And you said you bombed that day  It wasn't good  It was  I got a couple of laughs  But it was a very intimate setting  Vince was there  Obviously Shane  His friends  And it was a very small  Boat ride  Pat Patterson  I think  Shane didn't want to answer  If he masturbated  But again he was a younger guy  Then he put his friends  And they didn't know me  It was like  If I was a known comic  At that point maybe  But I wish I had saved the shirt  Because I had  They gave me a shirt 
[03:02:00]  That said  SS Shane McMahon  Bachelor party  Remember when you asked me  What wrestling memorabilia  I wanted  That shirt would have been  That shirt would have been  I had it from Shane McMahon's  And I threw it out  Pat Patterson  With my fucking  With my rock shirts  You know 10, 11 years ago  Because I just didn't  I should have saved that one  Yeah  I remember Pat Patterson  Beat Ted DiBiase  For the Intercontinental Championship  He took a pair of brass knuckles  Out of his tights  I should have checked for that  And I was flipping out 
[03:02:30]  How did you not see  They totally had me  You would want that sound  The Shane McMahon  Bachelor party t-shirt  Yeah  SS Shane  It's ungettable  What are you going to find it  On eBay  I wonder how much  Those are worth  Maybe  I mean nobody has it  Except for the people  Who went to his bachelor party  And nobody's selling it  There weren't wrestling fans  At his bachelor party  This is your Franklin Mint side  Sam will remember  Remember when Shane wrestled  Steve Blackman  Yeah  And he took that gigantic fall 
[03:03:00]  Like they had to play  Two things  Of the screens  The SummerSlam  Yeah  He was like 40 feet  Up in the air  And you know  I mean they had a place  For him to land  But it took a lot  That kid's got some guts  It was huge  He got some guts  And one of the perks  When I was in Good Graces  With WWE  Is that I would go  Like once the show started  I would go into Vince's office  And take like  Whatever steaks  They had leftovers  He was a guy  Who liked the best  Of everything  So it was  A really good filet  It was usually a good filet  Sometimes it would be 
[03:03:30]  A great chicken breast  But if it was Chinese food  It would be the best Chinese food  To kill for his office  Yeah  And it was understood  And when I went back there  After I'd almost gone to TNA  The first time  Like I knew the relationship  Was strange  I didn't feel like I had that  I didn't have that power anymore  To kill for  You couldn't take his shit  Without  With impunity  Yeah  But on that day  Where Shane took the big fall  I went into the office  And Linda McMahon  Was in there  And she was sobbing  Uncontrollably  Because she'd just seen  Her son fall 40 feet 
[03:04:00]  Even though he was okay  It was still  Quite a trip  And she was sobbing  Uncontrollably  And the thing to do  Would have been  To say it's okay Linda  And then leave  And I said  I'll only be a minute  And I went about  Preparing my plate  While Senator McMahon  Sobbed uncontrollably  Are you still being  Cautioned with the finances  I hope  Am I being cautioned 
[03:04:30]  Yeah  Yeah  I'm still cautious  Yeah  Yeah  My kids can't see it  You know  My kids  They take great issue  To the fact that  I make them drive around  In the 2002 Chevy Venture  Oh boy  Oh man  I love it  The older and uglier it gets  The prouder I become  Really  Oh I just  I just beam with pride  Not into anything new  And shiny  You know why  Because now  I rent cars frequently  Now when I'm on the  Emerald Isle  And I see an Impala  It's like  Oh boy  And if it's got 
[03:05:00]  Leather interior  Like I might as well  Be in a Maserati  It's just a thing  Of beauty  Yeah  It's not like  Well you didn't  Piss your money away  You have  You have the means  Do you ever  Treat yourself to something  What's the last thing  What's the last luxury item  You got yourself  You know what  I think I mentioned this  Like a year ago  When I was on the show  I got a car stereo  I did  What year is this  That's just about a year ago  I bought a bunch of the cars  Who you hang out with 
[03:05:30]  Huggy Bear  What year is this  Super tuner  I got the amplifier  Under the seat  Yeah so  You were still flight coach  Wow  I'm amazed that Mick will  Fly coach  Well you know what  I mean when I fly  WWE always had me  In first  I'd wrestled for 14  15 years  When I first got an F  On my  On my fare  I had no idea  What it was  I'd seen Y fairs  And B fairs  And C fairs  And Z fairs  And I went up  To one of the guys  What the hell  Is an F fair  They said  It's first class 
[03:06:00]  And I said  What kind of mistake  You know  Has it been a mistake  You're the world champion  The world champion  Always flies in first  And then I lost that title  Like three weeks later  And the F still came up  And I like  I didn't say anything  And then one of the guys  Let me know  That like in WWE  Once you're the world champ  You're kind of  Grandfathered in  So I got used to it  And then you know  When I went over  To the other place  Like my manager  Made sure that was  One of the things  Like it's more  The gesture of respect 
[03:06:30]  You know  Than it is  It also makes the company  Look better  It really is  On a high profile company  Like that  If you're the champion  And you're sitting  In fucking 37D  It looks ridiculous  And there's also  There's nothing worse  Going from first  Back to coach  You really feel like  It's like a  Behind the music arc  Yeah  You know what I mean  He started off  The modest  37D  As Jimmy says  When I book my own flights  You better believe  I'm a  Coach  Oh I don't doubt it  But I get bumped up 
[03:07:00]  Quite a bit  In Delta  Because I got the  Million miler  You know  The million miler status  But when you show up  At the airport  And you're hoping  For the upgrade  On the cross country flight  You don't get it  Why wouldn't you  Just pay for first  Do you have the money  It's not like  It's principle  My friend  It's principle  You gotta live by principles  And I've learned the secret  On Southwest  Is I'll try to get on  And get that exit row  And then if I see  A heavy person  Coming from that middle seat  I reach for the  Air sickness bag  And start breathing heavily  And it works like a charm 
[03:07:30]  Oh they don't want it  That is a good one  Wow  Oh  Oh  Oh  He gets his  Fake puke  Sound  Air sickness  While it's still  On the ground  Yeah  This guy's gonna be  A problem  To sit next to him  And then I recruit  A thin person  You know  I say  Hey Bob  I wanna sit  Yeah  And then you gotta  I'll imagine that  You get a fucking fan  Like Sam  And he sits down  And he won't  Shut the fuck up  About wrestling  Just the whole flight  And then  At Wrestlemania  When you  Oh god 
[03:08:00]  You know  You know how  Southwest  They have the open seating  Which is where I usually  Take out the vomit bag  Festival seating  This one  Person punched me  In the shoulder  As hard as she could  Hey dude  She was  She was out of her mind  Oh man  And she thought  I'm such a big wrestling fan  And then she got on the plane  And I saw her make a beeline  For me  And she sat down next to me  And during the course  Of the flight  She was saying how  She usually prefers women  But that  She would make an exception  For me  Was she pretty?  You know what was weird 
[03:08:30]  Is that she became pretty  Over the course of the flight  I said  Well you know what  You know what happened  With  You know  Have you tried a relationship  With a man  She said  Ah my last relationship  With my old man  Didn't work out too well  And I said  What happened  She said  Ah I stabbed him  Stabbed him  So by the end of the flight  I said  Listen  If this were another time  Another place  Could you  Envision yourself  Stabbing me  Yeah  And I liked her  I was like  Ah you know  She went from being this  Unattractive  Very butch looking woman 
[03:09:00]  And something about  The stabbing  And the danger  Made her like  Exotic to me  And the fucking  Complete power  Of a year  Of she's a fan  Yeah  So it's possible  That's probably what it was  Like all of a sudden  You're just this guy  On a plane  And you know  You could fuck this girl  There's something  Hot about that  I imagine  I wouldn't know  But I've heard  Oh come on  You know  I told my wife  This story  The guy from  Warrant died  Right  And I  Remember the story  About one of my friends  Who joined the 
[03:09:30]  Mile High Club  With the lead singer  From Warrant  And my heart  Went out to her  I was like  I wonder how  She's taking this  They were very close  On that flight  It's the type of crowd  I run with  That's like  Almost impossible  To do now  Isn't it  I would never want  To fuck  All I think  Is when I'm peeing  I'll actually brace  My arm above me  On the fucking thing  Because I'm afraid  That the plane's  Going to drop  And I'm going to  Be paralyzed  By banging my skull  My dick would  Never work on a plane  Is that what you think 
[03:10:00]  Yes I do  Who would want to  Fuck in a public bathroom  Wow  Well that's just  The only time  Jimmy's like  The only time  The Mile High Club  Thing works  I think  Is if you  You're flying  Flying private  And you have  You know  A fold down bed thing  It's for the wealthy  You're not  You're not even  Fucking coach  On frontier airlines  Joining the Mile High  That'd be interesting  To wonder  How much harder  It is to get away  After 9-11 
[03:10:30]  Or just how many  Handjobs  On a daily basis  Does a handjob count?  I don't think a handjob  Counts as Mile High  Post 9-11  When there's no more blankets  And anything you ask  You got more peanuts  Why are you being hostile?  And then everybody's  Looking for any weird movement  That another passenger's making  A repetitious movement  Under a blanket  It means you're putting  Together a bomb  From a sense of feel  Like you've practiced it  No  Just getting a handjob  No I 
[03:11:00]  Oh I had a thought  Oh my friend Mark  Told me years ago  He was flying  He was like  His friend was a pilot  They flew smaller planes  And he said  He got blown  On the plane  And he goes  As he was about  To blow his load  I think he told  And the guy  Fucking just like  Went like  Yeah  Dole a little bit  He fucking blew a load  In a girl's mouth  While the fucking plane  Was diving  He said  It was amazing  Coming while your stomach's dropping  Yeah  Yeah I can't picture that  It's gotta be a little odd  Yeah  That's a weird way  To get fucking blown  Yeah maybe  Probably force it out 
[03:11:30]  A little more  I don't know  That's an odd thing  I don't know  It's just impossible  To get away with anything  But just having a shitty ride  On a plane these days  We were talking about it earlier  The grand old days  Of the stewardesses  With the short skirts  That's just gone  Now they're flight attendants  And don't fucking  Call them stewardess  And they're not as young  As they used to be  Have you had the  The singing flight attendants  No  Oh man  And you know  I fly southwest 
[03:12:00]  Quite a bit  Especially when I was  Going to Orlando  With TNA  And you get the same  Flight attendant  Singing the same song  Holy shit  You know  About landing  Like they'll turn  Oh like they'll talk  About the safety ship  Yeah  Yeah  That type of thing  Or when you're landing  I don't  I won't even try to make up  The words  Even though I'm just about to  Like oh we're landing  We thank you for flying  On south woods  Oh  I think I've had that one  I remember that  There's so many of them  Oh I'd want it to wing over 
[03:12:30]  And nose in  I hate that  Fucking shit  I hate  Fun on a plane  I really do  From the crew  Fucking beat it  Don't try to entertain me  The same thing  With the waiter  Who comes up  And puts his foot  On your table  And says  Oh  You're the specials  You just want to be served  You know what it is  It's like  Through the unprofessionalism  He thinks he's being  More one of the guys  It's like  No I want professionalism  I want service  I hate the crowd  On the plane  When they laugh  At their dumb jokes 
[03:13:00]  Just encouraging them  Oh yeah  It's like  If this person was  In a comedy club  You wouldn't have laughed  At that  No  You're just all nervous  You think if you laugh  If that means  It's not going to crash  Right  Here's the  Here's the classic  Airplane standby joke  Which is  Ladies and gentlemen  We have a  First time flyer  He's 97 years old  And then people  Clapping on your way out  Say hello to him  In the cockpit  Oh I get it  He's flying the plane  That's crazy  I've never heard that  I don't like  Fucking jokes 
[03:13:30]  I really don't  Because they're not funny  And I really  It annoys me  I don't like jokes  So fucking much  When they try to have  Personality  Don't try to have  Personality to hide  The fucking death  We're about to face  I mean  Yeah  We're entrusting  Our lives to you  Virgin America's  A great airline  I've flown them  A few times  And they're really good  But they have  This recording they play  Where they have  The seat  If you've never  Used a seat  Just go through  Your boring announcements  And stop trying to  Jazz this up  Shit heads  That's what I like 
[03:14:00]  I like the straight face  Boring fucking display  She's just up there  Clicking the belt  The mask  Put it on  Yeah  Okay  I fly so much  Just talking about this  It's depressing me  That on Monday  I have to fly from here  Newark all the way  Back out to LA  That's a long  What airline?  I go American  Coach?  Coach  Never  Absolutely  I'm all the way  In the back  Are you a coach?  Yeah  I swear to God  You know  I've flown so much  I'm sure you can do this shit 
[03:14:30]  Where you can fall asleep  For a couple hours  And look out the window  And pretty much guess  Within three states  Where you're at  Where you are  Oh yeah sure  Yeah  You know the pattern  Where they're gonna fly  Sometimes they go up  Into Canada  Most of the times  They look down  Can pick out the Great Lakes  I've actually gone  And looked at ballparks  And been like  That's gotta be Cleveland  Where is it?  There it is  There it is  There's the Jake  And right on the waters  The Hall of Fame  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  With the Cleveland Browns  Yeah  Virgin Atlantic  You know  They've got the super economy  And it's a good deal  I wouldn't know 
[03:15:00]  Oh man  As far as I'm concerned  If it wasn't for the wings  The back of the plane  Could fall off  I sat there for fucking  The first 18 years  Of my career  I wouldn't care  If literally a fucking  If Zyklon B  Was dropped in the back  Of the plane  I should've quit  One joke  Do you always fly first?  I won't say always  No shorter flights  I won't  Like you know  Chicago  I won't spend  That kind of money  Or fucking Florida  Anything over three hours  I make myself do it  Because it's like  I fucking  I used to dread flying so much  And it became  Such an important part 
[03:15:30]  Of my career  And now the gigs  Give you a partial  Buyout  On the fucking flights  Yeah $300  Towards that $4,000 ticket  Well you know  I make myself do it  It's a write off  Well I  When I had the last book out  You know  They only had the money  For the  For the U.S. tour  But yet  I would look  And I would see  That I was flying  From  From  From Orlando  Or I was  I was flying  From  From  Kentucky  To West Virginia 
[03:16:00]  Via Atlanta  When it was actually  A 130 mile  Drive  And I would say  Can I just drive this  You know  And save you guys  Five or $600  But when it came  To the budget  They said  No we can't  Send you  You know  We don't have the money  To go to Canada  So I got a ticket  For $120 round trip  Flew myself to England  So I could do  Three dates in England  Because you know  I go out  I mean  If I don't  I've failed a lot  But I like to know  If I fail  It's not for lack of trying  You know  I don't want to be  With guys sitting  On the couch  Going  If I would have 
[03:16:30]  Tried a little harder  You have a $120 ticket  To England  No no no  120 to Toronto  And back  Okay  The UK  They get those  Those super economies  Which I would insist on  Like I'm going out there  I'm doing four comedy shows  In the UK in November  And I told the guy  Okay you know  We don't know how  This is going to go  Even though tickets  Man they're really  We sold all but  12 tickets in one day  At the Leicester Square  Theater in London  So I'm pumped  You know  I'm pumped about going there  But on the way back 
[03:17:00]  From my you know  Self-paid UK tour  I saw that I could  Save money  By ditching my  Super economy ticket  And only pay like  40 extra bucks  For the  For the exit row  But it's a 747  The exit row  Was right  In the middle of the plane  Right next  To the six  Toilets  Oh  So that every person  On the plane  Who has to take a dump  Had to pass  Right by me  Literally  It was the worst  Seven hours 
[03:17:30]  Oh shit  I mean I'd rather  Do go through  Hell in a Cell again  Than sit in that seat  Bad  It was just like  And it was also  The  Perpetual line  Where there's no  Yeah  The perpetual  Yeah  Six, seven people  It opens up  And then the reek  That you just  Every time the door opens  It just stinks  If you have a family  And you're flying  Your family  That's one thing  I understand it gets  To be expensive  But it's a write off  It's almost like  When you're flying  For work legitimately  I only fly for work  It legitimately 
[03:18:00]  Is a work expense  So you can write it off  So it's like  It's not  Yeah but it's only  The tax on that money  No I know  But I mean  It is something  Like I treat  I'm 43  I'm not fucking 18  And just wildly  Spending money  I'm fucking 43 years old  And I'm tired of it  I'm gonna start doing it  That's the best part  About traveling with Jim  When we go to Comic Con  And stuff  Is we're hanging out  Together the whole time  Except we're boarding  The plane  And he goes  Alright Sam  See ya  Later  See ya when the plane lands  We're in the classic  Relationship right up front  You get on the plane  See ya later Sam  He has a mud mask  With a curve 
[03:18:30]  But I flew coach  For many years  I fucking flew  I sweated the upgrades  I would call  Every fucking time  For the upgrades  Believe me  I sat in the back  For most of my life  So it's like  I don't even call  For the upgrades  Now  I don't even give a fuck  You're just like  Fuck it  Just get me  Point A to point B  And this is specifically  For Norton  Because I think  We're in the same boat here  There's this little part  You can agree or disagree  Of me  That really enjoys  Seeing how uncomfortable  Other first class passengers  Get when they see  They've got me  Next to them 
[03:19:00]  Like I'm like  One of the guys  They're specifically  Trying to avoid  By going to first class  Oh you mean  By the way you dress  Or something  By the way I dress  And just look at me  Like oh  This is like  This is the type of person  I was hoping not  To sit next to  And coach  He definitely got upgraded  To this day  One of the biggest  Compliments of my career  Is when I was upgraded  To bit on the way  Back from Japan  Where I'd had that death match  And I'd had so many places  In my body stitched  You know  It was the hand  It was the  The remaining ear  Had 14  I had 6 in the hand  I had 7 in the eyebrow 
[03:19:30]  It was a total  Of 42 stitches  In 6 different places  And while I was at the hospital  I didn't even realize  That I'd  I'd been burned  I had second degree burns  On most of my arm  Because that skin underneath  Is the same exact color  Like there were so many  Other things that hurt  That it wasn't  Until the next day  I woke up  And I saw that  It was getting all crusty  You know  And it was turning  And it was like  Brownish  And because I'd had  The stitches  I wasn't allowed  To take the shower  And so I had just  Blood caked in my  Caked in my hair 
[03:20:00]  I got the big patch  On the eye  I mean I just  I love  My eye was all swollen up  From where it had been  Punched  And I could not  Possibly look worse  And the lady  In business  Sitting next to me  I mean she looked  Like she needed  That air sickness bag  For real  And she got up  To use the restroom  Like an hour later  I'm like man  This is one long dump  This lady's taking  I look in the back  And she was like  Snuggled up  In a window seat  And Coach  And Coach  Had actually made  The choice  To move to Coach 
[03:20:30]  To leave first class  Take that away from me  And I was like  I've still got it  I could horrify  Still got it man  I could still horrify people  And now with this short hair  And the clean  I know you're looking like  I'm not likely to scare anybody  I look like shit  When I fly sweatpants  And a fucking Aussie shirt  Yeah I never care  I love the fact  You're wearing a suit  On a fucking plane  You dildo  With his tent  And his sweatpants  Direction  Fucking half the rod  Do you know how many  Fucking  Three day later  I forgot  I took a Cialis rods  I've gotten on a fucking aircraft  I actually have a blanket  I fly with 
[03:21:00]  Because I used to have to  Cover myself  Because I fucking  Piss so much  I'll put my hands  Down the front of my pants  To keep the waistband  And my sweatpants  Off my fucking bladder  And I always get  Very powerful rods  On the plane  Nice  Nice  You remember when I had  The part of the Mankind  Character  Was pulling the hair out  And throwing it there  And I would actually  I would pull the dead  Hair out  And I would throw that  Up there  But to give the illusion  That I was pulling  By the roots  I would shave little divots  Out of my head  Just kind of haphazardly 
[03:21:30]  And the undertaker  Told me  Committing  He was on a flight  And he said  The guy next to me  Was just horrified  While I was sleeping  And I said  Why?  Why is that?  And he's got that deep voice  He's like  Jack  He still calls me Jack  You know  The cactus jack  He's like  Jack  You have to understand  You've got 11 stitches  In your head  You've got little areas  Of missing hair  You've got a black eye  You have your shoes off  And you have a sock puppet 
[03:22:00]  With a happy face  On your foot  And I think of all those things  It was the foot  You know  I would reuse those sockos  You know  I could write those off  I'd reuse them  Jesus Christ  That's like a sickness  At this point  Oh yeah  I was feeling pretty good about it  Does that drive your wife crazy  Like that level of frugalness  I'll call it  It's OCD by the way  It's a piece of OCD  Is it really?  Yeah I believe so  Just holding on to that money  Oh not  But not being  There's a difference  Between being smart  And being saving  And I try to fucking  You know again  I paid into my fucking 
[03:22:30]  Principal because I hate  Giving the bank's interest  Yeah yeah  And then there's a point  Of well I'm living life  And if I can afford  A little bit of good stuff  You know you treat  You make life comfortable  We'll go on a nice vacation  I just don't like having stuff  But it becomes  Yeah she probably  Gets so annoyed at you sometimes  Is that what Brad Pitt said  In Fight Club  You don't own your stuff  Yeah your stuff owns you  Your stuff owns you  But you know who convinced me  Fucking Louie  And I was talking  It was just a movie Mick  Yeah exactly  You can go and get yourself  A nice comfortable bed  At some point dude 
[03:23:00]  The amount of punishment  You've taken  You gotta treat yourself  You know I'm a  I'm a three star man  I'll specify on my bookings  Three star hotel  Three star  Don't need the four  I don't need the four  But you know what  Those nicer ones  They won't leave you alone  Yeah they're too nice  Hello Mr. Foley  We're just calling you  To make sure everything's okay  Right as you start to fall asleep  And then they'll knock  Turn down service  It's like do you have  Like can you just fuck off  Louie told me that  Years ago he told me  That when he flies  He goes he travels first 
[03:23:30]  And he stays in a suite  And he doesn't give a fuck  What it costs  He's like just take it  Out of my pay  I don't fucking care  Really  Years ago  I mean when he could afford it  But you know  It wasn't making what he's making now  And I just thought of that  And he's like he just wants  To enjoy that fucking  Traveling when you travel  For a living  Shouldn't be a nightmare  That you regret  And go oh fuck  Am I gonna get out  Who am I stuck  It should be like a comfortable  Part of it  Because you don't hate it this much  You know give me an impala  And a three star  And I'm pretty good  Look if you're cool  And you're comfortable  That's all that matters  I was on the book tour  In 2003 
[03:24:00]  And you know  The book tour right  This is author talk here  So  You don't get paid  Because you're promoting  A project  But they put you up  In great hotels  Take care of the food  And everything  And after three weeks  My publicist called up  And she said  We're concerned  That you're not eating  And I said  No no I eat  Because we haven't seen  A single charge  I said well you know  I go across the street  To the deli  I got a protein bar  I got a little fast food  She said you know  We pay for this  And I said listen  You know 
[03:24:30]  No disrespect  But I broke in a certain way  And I just can't pay  Fifty dollars for scrambled eggs  No matter who's covering it  I can't do it man  You've said that before  That's a fucking OCD thing  There's a weird thing  It's like  When you're in a casket  They're not gonna put  All you saved  On top of you  I don't know if this is  Because of the same reasons  But what grossed me out  Was before mankind  Used the sock puppet  He had a glove  Over his two fingers  They used to shove  In everybody's mouth  And Mick  You put a bunch of stuff  On eBay  And I was reading  The descriptions  And one of it 
[03:25:00]  Was the glove  That covered your two fingers  That you put  In everybody's mouth  And on the auction  It said only two  Of these exist  Yeah  There were only two  That's why I was  The least popular person  In the dressing room  For about a year  You'd keep shoving  The same glove  In everybody's mouth  Sometimes I watched it  Sometimes I didn't  You know what's funny  Is the hierarchy  You know  In WWE  And the locker room  I guess  You know  As you call it  Decorum  Is that the right word  Sure  Yeah  Decorum  Is that like 
[03:25:30]  When I wrestled  The Undertaker  It was always clean  Well I remember  You doing it  To The Undertaker  And there being a loogie  At the end of the glove  Wasn't that his loogie  Yeah it was his loogie  But that means  You put that glove  Into somebody else's  Someone else's  No I would purell it  Or whatever  Purell it  You know  I would use a clean sock  Every time I did the Socko  Except Mark Henry  Was new  And it didn't matter  He was the world's  Strongest man  And they asked me  Did you use  There was a word for it  Like the gimmick sock  Or something like that  And I said  At this point in his career 
[03:26:00]  Mark Henry doesn't need to know  There is a gimmick sock  Like the one that was less ghastly  But you know  My kids get on my case  Because my daughter  Maybe it is OCD  Maybe I'll check it out  And she can't make sense  Of the fact that  You know  She's like  Dad you won't let us  Buy anything  And then you give all your money  To kids in Africa  Oh shit  And I was like  You know  I'm not even going to answer that  One day you're going to come up to me  And you're going to explain  Why it's different  It's hard for me to explain it 
[03:26:30]  You know  They've actually come up to me  And talked about their  Their inheritance  My kids  Wow  They're afraid I'm giving away  My inheritance  Elvis was very generous  Like how much you got left  Dad  What are you doing  Elvis was very generous  With strangers  There's a very famous story  Of him walking by  The car dealership  And there was an old lady  And I guess  I hope it's not an urban legend  Where he saw an old lady  Looking at a Cadillac  Or whatever it was  And he goes  You like that car  And he bought it for her  He was weird like that  But around his own people 
[03:27:00]  He was horribly cheap  He paid them very very low  Which just breeded  Resentment  From people who fucking  Cared about him  And took care of him  Is that right  I've seen her  One time  You fly him  You go get  Fucking peanut butter  And jelly sandwiches  Yeah I'm not saying  He wasn't extravagant  And weird  But I heard he paid  Very cheap  And it's almost like  The ego feed  Of giving to others  Was like a big ego feed  But like with the people  Who are already there  But I hope that's not  Just an urban legend  So you're saying  I give money  For the ego feed  No  Charity's a little different 
[03:27:30]  No I'm not saying that  Africa's about Nick  Yeah  Giving money to charity  And starving people  Is not  I think that classifies  As just being a good guy  Yeah  I'm not saying that  You're wrong to do that  Well Mick  Can I ask me the question  I'm sorry  Before I forget  No  I'm sorry  Okay Jimmy  I'm sorry  Sam we talked  Sam is obsessed  With wrestling paraphernalia  And stuff  And I know you've sold a lot  Do you have anything  It doesn't have to be  Something that is yours  That he can have  Yeah  But  But 
[03:28:00]  Here's the thing  It should be something special  And it should be something  That he would have to frame  And hang in his living room  Because his girlfriend  Will hate  That he has to hang  Something framed  In the living room  But it should be something  You have to display  In the living room  Hopefully  Hopefully giant  Next time I'm on  I will bring something special  Just for Sam  Yeah  Because he  Nobody is more supportive  Of the art than Sam  Right  And he can't afford  To buy this stuff  Like the  On eBay  He can't afford  You don't know how many times  I checked the eBay auction prices  On those boots  Oh yeah  And I was like 
[03:28:30]  Look  I work here  I'm not making enough money  To pay $3,000  For cactus jack boots  Yeah  We raised 20 grand  With my good stuff  For rain  Damn  And my kids  Like who would buy that  Like I was putting up  A pass to Whitewater  From 1996  And my son was like  Who would buy that  And that was like  The first thing  And I'd sell him  For a hundred dollars  Were you poor  When you grew up  I think I've asked you  That before  I don't remember  You know what  I didn't feel like I was poor  You know my dad  Had a good job  He was an athletic director  It wasn't until years later  That I realized 
[03:29:00]  That other people  Heated their homes  You know  Like my friends  And they would be  Bundled up  You know  Like we had it on 56  Growing up 56  No AC  56  No AC  That's my mom  Yeah no AC  You don't do that  To your kids right  No not at all  Okay  I remember when we  Finally moved in a house  That had central air conditioning  Then my parents  Were so conservative  They wouldn't  Turn it on  Drove me  They would leave it  At like  You know  You know  You know  74 
[03:29:30]  We'll keep it  It was just enough  To be fucking uncomfortable  Yeah  I would go to bed  It's fine  I would turn the AC on  When I went to bed  At like 4 in the morning  And my fucking  I would just hear  The shitty bedroom door  Open an hour later  And my mother heard it  And then I would hear  And turn it down  Then you wake up  All hot  Shit  Fuck that  I need  I need the bedroom  Like a refrigerator  Yeah  It's gotta be really  My parents in our house  They had an air conditioner  In their room  So sometimes we can go in  And watch a TV show  And cool off  And then it'd be back

[03:33:30]  Of course Sam Roberts  Stay tuned for the big  Aftershock  Big aftershock  With Sam Roberts  Aftershock  Anything with the  Following the word after  Is not pleasant right  It's the after birth  After birth  After  After  Well after birth  May be pleasant  Anthony has  I don't like the fact  That it is  It's pro-abortion  I like the fact  He took that stand earlier  He has to take that stand earlier  But I like the fact  That it's like after birth  Like we  Our show  Is like the nice baby  And then after that 
[03:34:00]  Just comes this mucky crap  That is your show  And then it gets  It gets marketed as cosmetics  Did you know that  Oh yeah yeah  Makes people beautiful  And that shit on their face  They do yeah  People rub the after birth  Really  Just call it aftershock  Yeah  A couple of shock jocks  You get it  Aftershock  Where were you  When I started doing this show  I'm not out to name names  Of cosmetic companies  But there is a very high end brand  That has the phrase  Human placental protein  Yeah  Which is actually just after birth  And it's delicious  So you have the cosmetics people 
[03:34:30]  Coming  Dude you really are a ghoul  That's horrible  Yeah you're gonna rub  That's delicious  Looks like that thing that  Looks like that thing from Alien  That's stuck on  The guy's face  And wraps that  Umbilical cord around their neck  Yeah  That shit  Should be in the Aliens movie right  Exactly  And on that note  Thanks Chip  Thanks for bringing it home  Keep me here longer  All right  Good night  Good night  Hey wait wait  Bill  Good morning everybody  Bill Burr  What are you called to something  Oh  Oh Burr  I guess  See you tomorrow 
[03:35:00]  Jesus  The Sam Roberts show  Can do whatever it wants  Oh really  Yeah I don't care  The virus  Sirius XM  Hey hey hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  Continues  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  I know that song  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  And we have a very special guest  Because Mick Foley  Has decided to stick around 
[03:35:30]  And Mick  I'm assuming you're only doing this  Out of pity  Out of pity for me  I mean  Kindness  No pity  Just  Kindness  You know how  The Opie and Anthony show works  They insult the after show  All they want  But they listen every day  Like every day  Anthony comes in  And says  Hey I was listening to the after show  And blah blah blah  It's a good show  And it's not like  You're the first guest  Who's been here  It's not like  I just tricked you  Into coming  Loverboy  The band  Really  Did an acoustic version  Of Working for the Weekend  You're talking about  Mike Reno  Yes on this show 
[03:36:00]  Did he wear the headband  No he didn't wear the headband  Are you kidding me  But he didn't  I got away with  Working for the Weekend  They wanted to play  The new song  But I pressured him  And look  Let's play the hit  Let's play the one  People know  And they did Working for the Weekend  Acoustic  Very good  And it was great  We didn't get to any phone calls  So if you wanted to talk to Mick  For a minute or two  Yeah  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969  I usually don't open up the phones  On the after show  But I figured 
[03:36:30]  Mick Foley's here  Ant's going home  I don't know if you heard the show  From the beginning  At 6am or 7am  I don't know  The replay's on at 3pm  If you missed this story  But Ant  Is going home  To his girlfriend  Who has a loaded shotgun  See Ant  Lives the lifestyle  Some call it paranoia  But  Somebody rang  His girlfriend  After he left the house  Heard the doorbell ring  At like  5  Whatever  As he was driving 
[03:37:00]  Into the show  She heard the doorbell ring  So she got a little worried  And she called up Ant  And instead of  I don't know  Doing something rational  Ant told her over the phone  How to load the shotgun  And taught her  How to load a shotgun  And so she's waiting at home  With a loaded shotgun  We all assume  That there was a good chance  That this was just a trick  Ant also has security cameras  On his house  That he can check on the computer  He rewound the footage  When he got to work  And there was nobody  Ringing the doorbell  So we're assuming 
[03:37:30]  That she's now waiting  For Anthony to come home  With a shotgun  Nice  So who knows  How it's going to work out  I hope  That he makes it  Into work tomorrow  We certainly hope so  Especially with Opie  On vacation  Yeah  Otherwise it's literally  Just me  I'm the last man  Sam and Jim  Which nobody wants to hear  I wanted to ask you  About the gathering  Yeah  Because you briefly mentioned it  I don't think Ant and Jim  Really know what the  Gathering of the Juggalos is  But trust me  I know the Juggalos 
[03:38:00]  Right  Hey  What was this experience like?  You know I took  I took the booking  You know  I mean they were  Paying very generously  And I like  I knew the rumors  About this  You know this show  And how they could be  Unkind to some of the performers  You talk about  Getting booed at the virus  On the virus tour  Yeah  This is the show  That Tila Tequila  Was at last year  And got pelted  With rocks and feces  Yeah  So you're  But you took the booking  Am I allowed to curse  On this show?  Absolutely  I'll throw one curse around  I like to make them meaningful 
[03:38:30]  I actually  Had seen a link  Some guy said  Hey good luck  On Twitter  Good luck  Hope you do better  Than this guy  And I thought  He was going to show me  A comic who had killed there  And instead  They had some guy  Dancing to an electronica beat  And he was just being  Pelted  Pelted by debris  I mean you know  There was just so many  Liquids going up there  And cans  And bottles  And he was like  Moving out of the way  Of it  He was like  I love you  It's okay  Peace  He was taking it  Really well  And I just thought 
[03:39:00]  A  I'm not going to react well  To debris being thrown at me  And B  I'm not quick enough anymore  To dodge the debris  Like he did  How would you react?  Because you're like  You have a persona  Of a lovable guy  But people kind of forget  That you also  As you described your appearance  Earlier on the show  In first class  You've been through  Death matches as well  And you're  But it's that respect thing  You know  We've talked in the past  About you know  Hey I didn't like  Being cursed out on the headsets  You know  Yeah  When you were doing  Play by play for WWE  It would have made me feel 
[03:39:30]  Like walking out  It would not have brought  My game up a notch  By having feces thrown at me  Right  You wouldn't think to yourself  Oh boy  I better stick this up  I've made it man  You know  They're bringing out  The best in me  This is like  Apollo Creed to my Rocky  Right  You know  I would not have enjoyed it  So I actually bought  A rain slicker  Just in case  And I stopped by  I almost missed my plane  Because I was  Stopped by a warehouse  Called  Lacrosse Unlimited  I used to be a goalie 
[03:40:00]  In high school  I hadn't picked up  A lacrosse stick  In over 20 years  Yeah  And I didn't even know  It wasn't their store  It was the warehouse  The guy was like  Oh you're going to be  Playing a little lax  I was like  No no no  I'm not going to play lax  They're like  What are you using  The stick for  I said  You know  I'm probably going to  Just catch some shit  Yeah  And he goes  What kind of shit  Human  Human shit  You know  That's thrown at me  Uh huh  And then I got out there  And it was like  A love fest  Well they also love  Wrestling  They love wrestling  I had done the 
[03:40:30]  The announcing  On their show  It took me 13 hours  To get to that  It just  It just reminded me  You were in the  Insane Clown Posse movie  I was  It was Cactus Sack  That's right  That's why  That's why they loved me  They were chanting  The name Cactus Sack  So it went really well  The wrestling was fun  It took you 13 hours  To get there  13 hours  Yeah  Why  I had to fly  Orlando  To Nashville  And then it was  Supposed to be  Three or four hours  I made it to  Cave and Rock  I had the GPS on 
[03:41:00]  It said  Cave and Rock  F-R-Y  Which I thought meant  Freeway  I thought okay  That's a little odd  That Cave and Rock  Has got their own freeway  And when I got there  It said  Approaching Cave and Rock  Ferry  I went  Ferry  And I show up  And there's just  The road ends  I can see Illinois  On the other side  Of the river  It's literally  A thousand feet away  And the ferry service  Had ended  For the evening  Oh my  Luckily there were  Some musicians  In a Winnebago  They were wrestling fans too 
[03:41:30]  Were they going  To the gathering  No they're not  Going to the gathering  They're just camped out  On the Kentucky side  I was about to say  You're losing the term  Musician loosely  If they're going  To the gathering  They're just  Camped out  On the Kentucky side  Of the border  And they were like  Yeah Cave and Rock  It's about 90 minutes  It's every bit of 90 minutes  And then some  I was like  It's right there  I can see it  Yeah  And it turns out  You know  I had to  Try to work  And I've got the GPS  And the phone  The phone lost the signal  And when the guy  From the gathering 
[03:42:00]  Finally got a hold of me  I was like  I don't know  When I'll be there  I don't know  If I'll ever make it  Just start the show  Without me  And because it was  The gathering  I got there  20 minutes late  And I was actually  An hour and a half early  You know  They started  Two hours late  I did the three hours  Of wrestling commentary  Which was a blast  And then I went on  At 4.30 a.m.  Not the optimal setting  Because it's 4.30  The fans have been  For the comedy  So they put their  Headliners on  Before me 
[03:42:30]  You know  Real professional comics  So you did wrestling commentary  And then you also did comedy  Yeah  But it went good  It really went good  It wasn't a great set  But it was pretty good  And under the  Under the circumstances  Given what I was expecting  It was like a love fest  Yeah  I mean I saw  Charlie Sheen  Didn't make it out unscathed  Yeah  He got some stuff  Thrown at him  Although I saw  At one point  Somebody threw  Some kind of garbage  At him  Maybe a can or something  He made the catch  Caught it  He caught it  I saw that one minute clip  But did he then come out 
[03:43:00]  And get more debris  Hurled at him  I think after that  They kind of let up on him  Because they liked that  But before that  That wasn't the first thing  They threw  He got pelted with a ton  Of stuff before that  But unlike Mick Foley  I guess Charlie Sheen  Doesn't have that pride  So he just kept  Coming out  And coming out  And coming out  And getting stuff  Pelted with stuff  I think he was probably  Being paid pretty handsomely  He should have worn  The Gordon's Gloucester  Rain slicker  Like that  I bought  The other thing I bought  Was a water cannon  And I actually went through  The trouble  Of buying a couple 
[03:43:30]  Gallons of milk  And so I then joked about  I didn't need to use  The milk filled water cannon  But you were really ready  For this to go wrong  I was ready for it  Because if I thought  If I even detected urine  Then they were going to get  A full force blast  Of what I would tell them  Was another bodily fluid  Like a cannon full of it  Yeah  And then it read  You know  And I said that  You know  You would get a  You know  Basically you'd get  A huge  Huge load in the face  And by looking  At this crowd 
[03:44:00]  I could tell  It wouldn't be  The first time  And then I was able  To segue  Into you know  This phenomenon  Of you know  Guys completely forgetting  You know  Where once upon  At a time  Semen ended up  Because now it's like  That all out assault  On a poor woman's face  Like that's gotta be  You had a whole thing  It segwayed nicely  And it was kind of  A you know  A nice touch  And I told it in a way  That people related to  That's beautiful  I mean  The plus side  Would have been  If you had 
[03:44:30]  Hit them with the  Semen cannon  It certainly would have  Made TMZ  Because TMZ  Loves disasters  At the Gathering  Of the Juggalos  They can't show semen  Well  I tell a story  About how  Once you had a cannon  Full of it  I called up  You know  Every wrestler  At the Gathering  Which was like  50 guys  He said hey  Planning on jerking off  Between now and the show  Yeah of course  Why  I was like  Can you save the sample  For me  You know  And I was just  Gonna pour all these  Cumulative  That's legendary  Wrestler loads  In there  And you know 
[03:45:00]  I think that would have  Been a nice visual  To get the  The scene  I have no idea  How the Gathering  Of the Juggalos  Makes a profit  I saw the list  Of people  That were gonna be  On this show  I don't know  How many fans  Were there  You know  I've heard anywhere  Between 10 and 40,000  But it's  It's this crazy  I'm glad I did it  Just for the experience  Honestly  I'd like to do it again  Next year  But even if I don't  It was worth it  Just to see this  You know  This  You know  Just  This  Battalion of 
[03:45:30]  Yeah  Strange people  Camped out  In little tents too  I'm trying to figure out  Some kind of way  We could form a connection  So that O&A  Can broadcast live  From the Gathering  Next year  I haven't pitched this  To O&A yet  So I don't know  If it's gonna go over  Man  Yeah  It would be  It depends  Like I was shocked  When I got  You know  Booed at the  At the  Traveling virus  So you would think  That these people  Would be O&A fans  But you can  You never can tell  No  Was that your first  Attempt at stand up 
[03:46:00]  You said on  That you did like  Five minutes  It was just you  Saying hi to the crowd  But you thought  You'd do a little stand up  And I did a little story  That I'd done in college  You know  About  My wife  Motioning to me  At Disneyland  And telling me  She thought that  Pooh Bear  Was trying to get  My attention  Because you know  These characters  That can't talk  But my wife's like  I think Pooh Bear  Is a wrestling fan  And I looked over  Pooh Bear was like  Confused  Like he wanted  To get my attention  And he finally did  The crotch chop  Pooh Bear  Doing the crotch chop 
[03:46:30]  And I mean  That's kind of a  Warm fuzzy  Cool story  And I told it  At college  And it had gotten  Over pretty well  And when I told it there  It was like  People started  Booing me  Well you have to  Understand like  I mean  I've been on this show  For years  And you'd think  That they'd have  Some kind of affection  For me by now  But literally  There are wishes  For my death  On Twitter  Every single day  Of my life  Every day  People want to see you dead  Every day  That I wake up  By the afternoon  Somebody has sent me  A message saying  That they wished  I was dead  You think it's the afro 
[03:47:00]  I don't know what it is  But maybe  Whatever it is  It's that's the  ONA fans  That's their mentality  That oh there's  Somebody on stage  We should boo them  But it is  That is kind of  A trial by fire  Yeah  I'm happy that  The ONA universe  Gave you  Probably the worst  Reception you'll get  In comedy  But also your start  Yeah  In comedy  It was my start  Made me never  Want to do it again  And it took a couple  Years before  But I was relieved  By the fact that  The guy who went on  After me  Rich Voss was the host 
[03:47:30]  And he just sliced me apart  With like two lines  You know  I was like oh god  Like you know  Really really  Oh you know  Hurt the ego  A little bit  But that you know  And then he apologized  On the air  Like hey man  You know  It's just business  You know  And like you  You know  You understand that  Completely  Now  And it would not  Have been so  Understanding  That wasn't the time  But I had been in  On the show  Like two weeks earlier  A week earlier  When they were  Trying out comics  For that open slot  That's right  We did car crash comedy  The winner gets to  Do five minutes of the virus  And so these are people 
[03:48:00]  You know  Doing their best stuff  The guy who was selected  Was really funny in studio  Yeah  And when he went out there  Oh my god  You know  They didn't even let him  Get a joke off  It made my reception  Seem like a  Woodstock love fest  Well it should make you  Feel better that  Bill Burr  Who obviously you know  And he's like a  Beyond successful comedian  Went to the  Traveling virus tour  He got booed  Out of the place  Wow  And when we were in Philly  He went up  And he  I can't even remember  Why he was getting booed  But they just started  Booing him 
[03:48:30]  They were booing him  Because the two comics  That were on before him  Who was  Dom Herrera  Okay  Got booed  And Dom's from Philly  Yeah  And he's a legend  In that city  And they were booing him  And then I think  Jimmy Schubert  Was on that show too  Jimmy Schubert  Yeah yeah yeah  So Jimmy  Set the tone  Where people were  Just not happy  With what was going on  Dom came on  And they were just  Booing because of  Jimmy Schubert  Bill came on  And they were still  Continuing the whole thing  And I'll let Sam  Take it from here 
[03:49:00]  What Bill did was  He said  He said  Fuck all of you  And said  How much time  Do I have left  And he had like  Seven full minutes  Left on his set  And he just spent  The entire seven minutes  Giving that crowd  The worst beating  That I've ever  Heard anyone give  It's one guy  Versus 20,000  Or whoever people  However many people  Non-stop shitting on Philadelphia  And he destroyed  The entire crowd  But then they respected him  Yeah  He got a standing ovation  At the end  He became a legend  You know  That's the way it is  That was very much  Like the ECW fans 
[03:49:30]  Yeah  In order to  Become a bad guy  In ECW  You know  I had to essentially  Take away everything  They liked about me  Like showing up like this  That was like the only time  In wrestling  That I went completely  Clean shaven  That I lost the goatee  And everything  And you showed up  In an Eric Bischoff t-shirt  I showed up  Forgive me Uncle Eric  You know  I was pulling out  All the stops  And you really had to do that  You know  I claimed to be eating  You know  Watercress sandwiches  Whatever it took  To lose their respect 
[03:50:00]  And what was so odd  Was that I had two shows  Left with the company  And everyone knew  I was going to  To WWF  At the time  You know  Which was  I got the  You sold out chance  For like three months  In WWF  And then they kind of stopped  And obviously  Going there  Turned out to be  The best thing  I ever could have done  There were guys  Who stuck around  Out of loyalty  To ECW  And like  Didn't realize  That eventually  Those fans  Would stop being loyal  To them  Like they're not  Taking up funds 
[03:50:30]  Yeah  For Axl Rotten  Yeah  Yeah  Sorry  Yeah  But if you want to see  I was going to say  I mean you talk about  Nice segues  Into different things  If you want to see  The way mixed comedy  Has evolved  Then you should check out  The brokerage tonight  By the way  It was probably  A year ago or more  That I saw you  At the brokerage  I brought Jess  It was a great show  Everybody had a good time  That was there  And it wasn't a sell out  But that's because  There was like  Hurricane weather conditions  And I remember  Driving through the rain  And it was a pretty 
[03:51:00]  Impressive crowd  For the weather conditions  But Mick has had  The worst luck  With some of his  Earlier stand up dates  Because there was  That hurricane rains  And nobody could  Get out to Long Island  Then the next time  You did a stand up set  I think  It was here in the city  But it was  It was during the blizzard  During the blizzard  And then the next time  I did the city  I got in at like  5 p  You know  Around 4.30  5 p.m.  Because I wanted to  Avoid that  You know  The traffic  And a few hours  Went by  Between the time  I got to the club 
[03:51:30]  And the time I went on  I went out there  There was like  8 people in the audience  And you talk about  A bomb scare  But there had literally  Been a bomb scare  Between 5 and 8  It was the guy  With the car  You know  Oh the Times Square bomb  Times Square bomb  Oh my  Yeah  You have the worst  When I came out  It was like  The whole  You know  The city  Had been almost  You know  Not literally evacuated  But nobody  Was going anywhere  So I have had  Some bad luck  That brokerage show  Was fun  But I was still  Under the impression  That I could go out  And tell stories  Like I did at colleges  Didn't realize 
[03:52:00]  That I actually  Had to have  You know  A little follow up  Punch  You know  Punch lines  Still had a good time  But this should be  A much better show  Well if you look up  On YouTube  You have started  Doing more  Stand up comedy  Is what you're doing  So if you look up  Mick Foley comedy  On YouTube  There's a few videos  You're going to video  More on this  We're going to do  These things  Professionally  I have my  Old mentor  From college  Coming in  And we're going to  Film them professionally  Edit it  And essentially  Just put them out there  So people can see  What I do 
[03:52:30]  You know  Like  And obviously  I'm not being  All that funny  On the show  On your show  Right here  I'm not like  Oh he's being awesome  Engaging and entertaining  Engaging and entertaining  But certainly not  Laugh out loud funny  But I have some good  Stuff lined up  Last night  When I went out  And did the  I did four sets  At three clubs  We went from the  Gotham  To comic strip live  To stand up  New York  Back to Gotham  And I did four  Different five minute sets  And it was good  Because they got stronger  As I went on 
[03:53:00]  You know  Like alright  You know  You get that confidence level  And you're obviously  Taking the stand up thing  Seriously  I am  You're doing  You're gigging  I'm gigging man  Yeah I'm gigging  A lot of people  Calling in  With this question  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969  Mick if you have to go  Let's take  You want to take  Two or three phone calls  And I gotta run  Gabe in Staten Island  You're on the after show  Hey how's it going guys  How's it going man  Good good  Quick question for Mick  I read some rumors online  That he was considering  Going back to WWE  Is this true  Because I know you  Kind of left the last time 
[03:53:30]  Because Vince was kind of  A dick in your ear  So I was just curious  That that was  A dick in your ear  I'd like to say  I've never  You know  Actually had a dick  In my ear  Literally  You know  There are definitely  There are definitely  Those rumors  I probably will  Sometime  In some respect  I'm not sure  What I'll do  But I'm going to  Plan on dropping  Like 50 big ones  Just in case I get  That Wrestlemania call  Yeah  Please do not  Go back to TNA  That was  TNA sucks  You know  I won't go back there  I enjoyed it there  But it was not  It was like  Trying to wear a pair of pants 
[03:54:00]  That just didn't fit  And after a while  You're like  You know  I just gotta  Get out of these pants  Did the pants  Start to fit less  When different people  Kind of took over  No not really  Okay  Not really  You know  You know  I mean  When it was  I would joke  That the show was  You know  TNA plus Mick Foley  Which is total  Non-stop action  Plus me  But then  They really started  Getting  Into emphasizing  Everything but the ring  Like the wrestling  Was just kind of 
[03:54:30]  Like an afterthought  And for me  My big talking point  Was okay  Maybe you know  Maybe WWE  Is like  The New York Yankees  Of wrestling  But that doesn't mean  The Tampa Bay Rays  Didn't have a better team  Last year  But when I really  Started believing  WWE had a better  Product  All around  It was  It's kind of tough  You know  For me to  Take a check  And not believe  In the company  I know that sounds  You know  What's your pride  You talked about  You know  It's like  I don't  I want to be  Representing the best 
[03:55:00]  And you can't go  And do interviews  And say  This is what I'm doing  If you don't  Honestly think  I had nothing  To  You know  It was hard for me  To talk about  The younger talent  Being groomed  I just  They kind of  Took the bat  Out of my hand  When they  Went away  From wrestling  To such an extent  What do you think  Obviously  WWE is doing  Some new stuff now  Are you watching  I am  Yeah  Yeah  I used to watch  Because my kids  My kids love WWE  You can learn a lot  From kids  And I realized  When we were living 
[03:55:30]  Like 30 minutes  From Daytona  And TNA was having  Their biggest show  Of the year  They're bound for glory  They like to consider  Their Wrestlemania  Which with all due  Respect to TNA  It's not  Like there's no other  Wrestlemania  Is Wrestlemania  Yeah  I mean WWE  Doesn't even have  Another event  That compares to Wrestlemania  And when I realized  That my kids  Did not want to go  To that show  But wanted to go  To the Daytona  House show  WWE was running  10 days later  Wow  Like they just said  You were like  Do you want to go  And they said  No thank you 
[03:56:00]  No they stopped  Wanting to go  And then I would say  Kids you know  Why don't you watch it  And they would run out  Like line up  Like five or six reasons  Which were all  Pretty legitimate  Pretty accurate  I mean I really  I did like it there  Most of the time  Yeah  I did not have a problem  With Hulk or Bischoff  Okay  I wish I'd  I wish I'd stayed  Until at least  Mid July  Instead of leaving  In May  But I relieved them  Of quite a bit of money  And then  You know  Sometimes things  Do work out  For a reason  I could not have 
[03:56:30]  Done the gathering  If I'd been there  I would have been  On the road  And I could not have  Done the celebrity  Wife swap  If I'd been with TNA  And that turnout  I mean  I know it's got  Like washed up loser  Written all over it  You know  Look  I may not be  Have the reputation  Of the manliest man  But Wife Swap  Is one of my  Favorite shows  I mean Wife Swap  Is always entertaining  There's never been  A non-entertaining  And you know  I had so much  When I say washed up loser  I mean that's  You don't get  You know  You don't get 
[03:57:00]  Your A-list people  On there  You get people  Who you know  Were probably  On the downside  Of fame  Yeah  But then you see  That revitalization  That's what it is  That's like  Dancing with the stars  Yeah  Yeah  And all of a sudden  These people are  Big stars again  Yeah  Who was Flava Flav  Before the surreal  The surreal life  Yeah  And now he's like  A really marketable guy  So we had him in here  A month ago  Yeah  Exactly  Would you have had him  On five years ago  No  Of course not  Exactly  I mean people have  Never heard him sing  I don't even  Did he sing  When he was with  He was like the hype man 
[03:57:30]  He was the hype man  Yeah  So he just kind of  Yeah  Shouted out words  We did the show  And I could not  I would not have been able  To do that  If I had been with TNA  So things worked out nice  I appreciated being there  It was fun  For quite a while  Do you see  When you're watching  WWE a spot  You don't have to tell me  What the spot is  But do you see  A possible spot  Where the pants  Do fit a little better  In WWE right now  Oh yeah  Yeah  I mean even  Even if it was  The ambassador role  You know 
[03:58:00]  TNA doesn't have  Or Impact Wrestling  Doesn't have  The ambassador role  You know  So when I was off the air  It was like  I was of no use  To the company  They weren't real  Good on  You know  Media appearances  You know  I mean  I was right  In Long Island  Most of the time  I was there  They just didn't have  The infrastructure  Yeah  They couldn't do it  Whereas WWE does  And there's a lot of jobs  A lot of things  I could do  And ways of contribute  That I could contribute  Without ever being on the air 
[03:58:30]  I wanted  Before you go  This is what was on my mind  Last time you were in here  You said  As WWE champion  You were sleeping  On some shady guy's couch  Yeah  You told that story  Last time you were on O&A  That you know  He ended up  I think there was  Some kind of drug thing  Going on  I thought they were  Showing up  Because I was a champion  The parade of seedy  Looking guys  And then the guy  Whose house it was  Said  No no  They  You know  He apologized to me  For all the people  Coming over  So I understand  You know  I've got the championship  And it's kind of a big deal 
[03:59:00]  He's like  No they weren't  They weren't there to see you  So what were they there for  My girlfriend's a crack dealer  And that's when I realized  Couldn't you have just lied  I started  That's when I started becoming  A two and a half  To three star hotel man  At that point  Well that point is  Really late in the game  To start becoming  You were a major star  I was a champ  You know  Everything  You were the star  All your experiences  On ONA  Have made it clear  That I have been forever  A giant McFoley fan 
[03:59:30]  How close was I  To having you sleep  Over at my house  If the offer's there  Where do you live  I live in Westchester  You could just come down  Like today  I might take you up on that  Oh my god  Not today  Because I've got to fly out  Of LaGuardia  I've already got my hotel  But another time  Sam  Yeah  I could  Not the couch  I mean I'm going to get  The master bedroom  I mean I'll put  We got a little love seat  In the couch  So I'll put Jess  On the love seat  I'll sleep the couch  You get the bed  All good  I would prefer Jess  In the bed 
[04:00:00]  Well I don't know  Because Jess has an affection  For you  I'm a snuggler  I know  As far as you will go  I know you are  But I think Jess likes you  A little too much  For me to allow you  To share the same bed  That's cool  And young Eric  The sex bagel  In the other room  He's a giant wrestling fan  As well  So I wanted to make sure  He gets a question in  You kind of took my thunder  Because I was going to ask  Mick  If I paid you $10  Could you go to Sam's house  For a night  And hang out  Watch wrestling  He's talking about  The charity auction  You have going on  Oh yeah  The auction  Yeah  I should have plugged that 
[04:00:30]  The best way to find out  Is to go on my Twitter  At Real Mick Foley  And then it's on my profile  Just click on there  And we're offering people  The chance  You know  A number of tickets  You buy five  Two dollar tickets  So it's a $10 donation  And you become part  Of the nationwide raffle  That will grant you  The grand prize  Of a home visit  From me  To come hang out  You know  With you  And there's people at home  Going  That doesn't sound like 
[04:01:00]  Much of a prize  It's a prize  You know  We take care of the airfare  I provide the food  And beverages  I bring pictures  I bring a little bit  Of memorabilia  And it's for  Anywhere from  Two to twenty  Twenty people  So  Or one to twenty people  Plus it's like  If you're calling your friends  And saying  I'm having a wrestling party  Hey by the way  Mick Foley's gonna be here  That would be the draw  Exactly  Right now  Actually  Things are going  A little slow  Because I don't think  People get the concept  That I'm actually  Getting on a plane  And we're not even  Limiting it to the US 
[04:01:30]  It's Canada  It's UK  And I was getting  These people from Europe  Going  How about the Republic  Of Ireland  You know  I was like  Alright  I thought  I thought  The UK covered that  But it's a different country  I'll go there  Germany  Austria  France  I'm kind of limiting  To places I can get to  From JFK  With an eight hour plane trip  If any of you  Watch Raw Smackdown  Or WWE pay-per-views  You obviously  Would find it a thrill  To watch them  With Mick Foley  On your couch  And your friends there  To see that Mick Foley's  On your couch  It's ten dollars 
[04:02:00]  To enter this  Raffle  Why not  Like there's no reason  Not to  I'm sure Eric  Has already entered  I'm going to enter  Hopefully I'll win  Just for the creep factor  Of Mick saying  Sam again  The celebrities  You know  It's called  Celebrities for Charity  And they have  Everything ranging  From you know  A visit to the  U.S. Open  I believe  Shawn Michaels  Brought somebody out  To Wrestlemania  I would like to do  Those type of things  It's such a great  Business model  There's no reason  If this is successful  That we can't do  A Survivor Series trip 
[04:02:30]  Where we fly  Two or four people out  Put them up in the city  For three nights  In New York City  So people  Donate  And there is a chance  There are legitimate winners  I mean I'm going somewhere  You're going to a guy's house  Yeah I'm showing up  At somebody's house  I get so nervous  Going to people's houses  I could never handle that  But obviously  You slept on couches  Well Mick  You have to go attend  To your children  I do  Which is a legitimate  Reason for going  So his Twitter  Is Real Mick Foley  That's where you can 
[04:03:00]  Get the information  On the charity auction  And if you want to  Go see him perform comedy  It's brokeragecomedy.com  It's on Long Island  It's at 8pm tonight  I would recommend  Everybody go  I was a little bummed out  That you didn't do  That you  Whatever  The scheduling stuff  Didn't work out  You were supposed to do  The pro wrestling syndicate show  Yeah  In Ron Conkoma  Yeah we were filming  Wife Swap  That's why I couldn't do it  I see  I was booked on that show  So we would have  Officially been booked  On the same show  I was managing the men  Who are now 
[04:03:30]  The tag team champions  I brought them to that glory  And their names are?  It's Pat Buck  Do you think they want  To be referred to  On national radio  As the guys?  Well they're  They're the Lone Rangers  That's their tag team name  They are the guys  They're the tag team champions  It's all about Sam anyway  Who cares?  Exactly  I brought them there  Let's be honest  You know  One of my  One of the stories I tell  I'm not sure if I'll do this  With the brokerage  Talks about how I succumbed  To the  The twin  The twin terrors  With Jack Daniels 
[04:04:00]  And Christy Canyon  One night  The most formidable tag team  Since Ben Doon  And Phil McCracken  Ruled the Canadian Maritimes  And then I say  That was a real tag team  Just say the name  Really?  Yeah a few times  And people would say  Ben Doon  And Phil McCracken  They would actually announce  These guys  The tag team champions  Ben Doon  And Phil McCracken  It's great stuff  Only in wrestling  I love it  Well Mick Foley again  The broker  Who's calling Eric?  I don't know  You want to take this last call?

It is  Yes sir  You have not been screened  So we're taking a chance here  Let me have it  Oh hey  This is  Pete  Calling from Philly  Hey Mick  I wanted to ask you  Back in the ECW days  Did you used to  Go to  Tony Luke's 
[04:05:00]  After some of your matches  And  If so  Have you been back  Ever since?  Tony Luke's  Is that a restaurant?  No  Yeah yeah yeah  Tony Luke's  The cheesesteak place  That used to be  Right around  Right around the corner  Of the ECW arena  I guess not  You know  I guess I did not  I was not much  The picture used to be up there  And it was signed  Well I  I may have  Maybe I stopped by  For a cheesecake  Cheesecake  Cheesecake  Cheesecake  One time  I don't recall it  I was not much  Of a socializer  Although I do remember  Watching our show 
[04:05:30]  With Smoke and Joe Frazier  In a hotel one time  Well  I guess that was  An anticlimactic  Final call  I asked him  About cheesesteaks  But  If you want to  Boost your confidence  Matt in Quincy  Illinois says  Mick and Jess  Make a fine couple  Nice  So  Okay I like to hear it  That's what it is  Mick  I appreciate you  Stopping by  And making the  After Show legitimate  While  We got a couple  Minutes left  Actually we  We really don't  We just play  We got two minutes  I see the clock  Okay  Play two minutes 
[04:06:00]  Of Mick Foley  Helping Ginger Lynn  Get the knee orgasm  By the way  Jess has  Destroyed me many times  For things that have  Happened in the studio  So I feel your pain  On this Mick  Let me hear it  Alright here it is  Mick Foley and Ginger Lynn  On After Opie and Anthony Live  Alright we're going to  Organize this though  We got $20 a man  Guaranteed less than  Five minutes right  Yes  Alright alright  Price is right  Closest to orgasm time  Without going over  And it's just my knee  So technically
