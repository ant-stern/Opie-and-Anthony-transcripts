<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious rant about significant technical malfunctions plaguing their XM Satellite Radio show. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton detailed suspected sabotage, citing missing equipment, reconfigured control panels, a hidden radio, and a poorly programmed 5 AM hour originating from Washington D.C.  Their frustration extended to issues with replays and a perceived lack of control over their programming, with Opie threatening violence against the culprit.  They also bemoaned poor XM promotion and low awareness of their radio return.  The technical difficulties and the resulting anger dominated a significant portion of the early show.  News items were briefly touched upon amidst the technical complaints.

The show then transitioned into a series of loosely connected segments.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit and crude discussions rating their attractiveness in different locations and detailing a graphic Craigslist encounter.  They mocked improv comedy, sharing an offensive anecdote involving a child pornographer.  A New York Post article about a man's extensive plastic surgery prompted further sexually explicit and homophobic commentary.  The show played a pre-recorded bit, "Hi, Mom, I'm Gay," before moving to listener-submitted audio, and the difficulties of accessing their old material.

A substantial segment focused on the controversy surrounding a Yankees t-shirt mocking the Red Sox, featuring extensive mockery and homophobic slurs directed at Red Sox fans. A listener call recounted a racist experience at a Red Sox game. The discussion continued with further offensive language directed towards the Red Sox and their fans.

The death of Christopher Reeve prompted a mix of somber reflection and insensitive jokes from the hosts, transitioning into a comedian's segment about performing in Branson, Missouri, and a brief news segment on "The Sims 2."  The hosts also promoted their XM show and a Law & Order episode.

The next segment began with further discussion of Christopher Reeve's death and Margot Kidder's mental health, alongside a listener's analogy comparing Red Sox World Series wins to the Kennedy family's history.  This segued into a bizarre news story about a man found dead in his apartment for two years due to automated bill payments. The hosts speculated on the family's negligence and discussed an Easy Pass toll scam.  They teased the upcoming appearance of "Jamaican Mike," known for his graphic stories about Jamaica. A caller from Illinois shared a similar story from Germany.

The hosts then mocked an article in *SYNC Magazine* about their return to radio, specifically the description of their celebration involving radio-controlled cars and Opie's appearance.  They referenced their past St. Patrick's Cathedral controversy.  A segment with attractive female gamers, described as "radio kryptonite," proved awkward and uncomfortable,  featuring little engagement from the women and punctuated by the angry arrival of "Frenchie," leading to a heated exchange with a staff member named Poe. The segment ended abruptly with everyone except Opie and Anthony leaving the studio, followed by reflections on the disastrous segment, jokes about the lack of sexual interaction, and a bizarre phone call about a repossessed car.  A song about SARS concluded this chaotic portion.

A subsequent segment included a caller praising Anthony's Mike Tyson impersonation, followed by calls from "Exification," the "Drill Doe girl," who graphically described a sexual experience, and various other callers, including one playing "Guess What's in My Pants" and another planning to be on a "Lesbian Couch" segment.  There were numerous prank calls.  The segment concluded with commentary on Regis Philbin's music CD and discussions about a listener's high-pitched voice and a complaint about explicit content in a children's video rental. Jim Norton offered commentary throughout.

The show's final segment involved the hosts advising listeners to skip certain segments, discussing an Oklahoma man who staged a robbery to impress his wife, and sharing a humorous anecdote about Opie's teenage self-harm attempt.  A call from Paul in Texas criticized their lack of diverse political commentary, leading to a crude, biased response and the call's abrupt ending.  The conversation continued with descriptions of the poorly executed robbery, a psychiatrist who paid traffic tickets with feces-smeared bills, and Steve's graphic account of a stripper with a yeast infection. The show briefly touched upon speculation about a device on George W. Bush's back and concluded with commentary on Eminem's music video mocking Michael Jackson's child sexual abuse allegations, including strongly negative opinions on Michael Jackson from the hosts.  Listener feedback, consisting mainly of vulgar jokes, followed, before the show ended with repeated declarations of "We blew it," music snippets, and an XM Satellite Radio commercial.

[00:07:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:07:30]  Jim Norton just jumped.  Just got blasted out of his earphones.  The brand new O.B. and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  We've got to welcome everybody that turned their radios on over the weekend, Anthony.  A lot of people went out shopping, did they?  Got themselves a radio, activated it, listened to our program.  The latest problem is kind of a good problem.  What's that?  All the stores are, not all of them, but a lot of the stores are sold out of all the XM Satellite products. 
[00:08:00]  That's what I'm hearing.  They've got to start becoming this fucking, fucking, fucking studio.  There's something else wrong with the place.  They're not even playing the right show.  No, we're on the air now.  Oh, we're on the air. Great.  Well, they're getting a great fucking show today.  We had a lot of great stuff to do on the show, but instead we've got to worry about getting the studio set up.  I can't hear shit in my headphones.  Oh, now the headphones are at least working. 
[00:08:30]  Jesus fucking Christ.  Yeah, you know, someone.  You guys hired a great radio show.  A great radio show.  But we need cooperation.  Every day we get in this fucking place, we can't turn half the shit on.  And then every, all the buttons are different on the fucking board.  And now in the control room.  We said everything, and two minutes before the show, when we should be preparing for our first break, everyone's running around in a panic trying to figure out how to get the show back on the air.  And today, the control room is screwed up. 
[00:09:00]  Somebody.  Somebody's messing.  Somebody is messing with this studio and the control room at night after we leave.  Somebody is.  This isn't a paranoid delusion.  This is something that is happening.  On a nightly basis, someone is coming into the studio and the control room and screwing around with the buttons.  And we come in here and everything is a mess.  Let me ask.  This has to be fixed.  Let me ask one question.  Does anyone else broadcast from the Opie and Anthony studio after we're off the air? 
[00:09:30]  Hello?  Anyone know that?  No.  No.  This is our studio.  Why are all the fucking buttons different every morning?  Somebody's coming in here.  Somebody's coming in here.  Everything is labeled nice.  Mic 1, Opie.  Mic 2, Anthony.  Mic 3, Jim Norton.  Mic 4, guest mic.  Then there's a dilette.  Then this is where the telephones come up.  Then this is where the shortcuts, all the nice little sound clips that Anthony plays during the show.  And then I don't even know what the fuck that button is anymore because they changed that too. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, somebody is screwing with this.  So just before showtime, in a panic, everyone's pushing every button humanly possible to try to get the studio back.  Get a fucking lock on our studio and stay the fuck out of here.  We got a radio show to do.  We're taking this seriously.  We got to put a camera in here so that we can just access it from home at any moment.  We can look into the studio 24 hours a day, and if someone's in here screwing with it, they will get punched in the face.  Are we even on the air? 
[00:10:30]  Punched in the face.  We are on the air now.  Now, what's going on in that?  I got your mic, and that's it.  I can't fire off anything else from here because DC isn't getting anything other than the mics, and I can't hear anything other than the mics.  Besides that, I'm getting complaints like crazy from the listeners.  You know, during the replay last night, they're playing Friday's show.  No one gives a fuck.  Yeah, what happened to yesterday's show?  It was supposed to rerun.  I can understand if it happens once, maybe something happened, but you fixed the problem. 
[00:11:00]  No, they keep running Friday's show over and over again, and no one notices and can fix it for us?  Or does that take 48 hours to figure out?  Everything takes 48 hours around here to figure the fuck out.  It was supposed to be yesterday's show, running yesterday, rerunning.  It was a fun show.  A lot of people enjoyed it, and now, unless you were listening from 6 to 10 live, you didn't get to hear it.  Well, I think the replays, to be fair, after the show worked, but then it was later on in the day that something went screwy. 
[00:11:30]  No one calls us and tells us what's going on.  They just throw a Friday show on.  We had a great show yesterday, and the people that listened to the show on the West Coast late at night,  they didn't get to hear yesterday's show.  That's what happened.  And then this 5 a.m. hour was a piece of shit.  They're playing Chris Rock bits with dead air.  I don't know who did that.  That might be our own people's fault.  Chris Rock is hilarious.  His stand-up is fucking hilarious.  But the skits he does on his CDs stink. 
[00:12:00]  So get him out of the system.  We don't want him during our portion of the show.  Well, our portion.  This is our fucking channel, supposedly, but we have no control of it.  This has to be taken care of.  There cannot be trolls walking around here at night screwing with the equipment.  Because then we can't come in and do a show.  It's ridiculous.  Everything is a mess from the control room to in here. 
[00:12:30]  We can't hear anything.  Does this even work?  I don't know.  Give it a shot.  Does this thing work?  Well, I got to...  Hold on.  Let's see if this works.  Hold on.  No?  Dudes, I will start breaking stuff.  I've done it in the past.  I'm going to start breaking stuff, okay?  We don't even have...  This isn't even up.  It's not a tumor.  Where's that coming from?  I think that works.  I heard it.  Even though it's a different pot.  There is no bathroom!  All right. 
[00:13:00]  We got that working.  All right.  Something works.  What's going on in the other studio, Steve?  Dude, honestly, I've done nothing differently than what I did for the last week and yesterday,  and somebody screwed with the settings so that I can't hear anything that's going on other than what's coming through your mics.  Okay, I'm not going to point any fingers or anything.  I would love to point fingers, but I don't know for sure.  If I find out, there's going to...  Oh, you have no idea what you're doing and who you're fucking with.  You'll get punched in the face.  And that's not even like a, hey, watch it, or you'll get punched in the... 
[00:13:30]  You will get punched in the face.  That will happen.  Don't think you're being cute.  So keep screwing with the equipment.  By sabotaging the Opie and Anthony show, you will lose.  You will lose.  Keep screwing with the equipment, whoever it is.  But we're getting ready to do the radio show.  We've got a lot of cool things to start off with.  And no, with 30 seconds left, we don't even know if we're going on the air.  That's not how you do a professional radio show.  It's just not how it's done.  I know.  It's coming up on 6 o'clock, and we go, okay, nothing works? 
[00:14:00]  How are you supposed to do a show?  We're in the fight of our lives, and we need people to wake the fuck up and help us out here.  How many people have access to this place?  Like, how many, really?  I'm not sure, but I mean, the problem is...  How many come in at night?  You can just walk right into the studio.  Dude, someone...  You know, I could just speak for what I know.  Someone is messing with this board every single day after we get off the air. 
[00:14:30]  And if no one's supposed to be using the studio, then, I don't know, logic says that someone's doing it on purpose.  Yeah.  Okay?  That's obvious now.  Because it's every day, and no one's supposed to be in here.  And we've told, you know, some of the people in Washington, we've got problems up here.  We need Master Poe to hide under the console.  When someone walks in here, he could just dart out and snap their neck.  Dust it for Prince. 
[00:15:00]  And then you lose your favorites on the computer every morning.  Every morning.  This is, like, such a treat.  The password changes.  I pop in a password.  I go to pop up my browser.  And my favorites are gone.  So I've got to sit there for a good 20 minutes in the morning and re-put in my favorites to all the websites that are on for some reason.  And I don't know why.  Unbelievable. 
[00:15:30]  We need more security in here is what we need.  We need a big lock on the door.  You know, that won't even work because someone's going to...  We won't have a key.  I could see us walking in.  Showtime.  We're locked out because of some technical glitch.  They'll put some master electronical lock on that thing, and we'll be locked out.  I don't understand it.  So we had nothing to do with the 5 a.m. hour today.  It was awful.  It really was.  It doesn't represent this channel, the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[00:16:00]  Skynet is taking over.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe we programmed that crap.  It was awful.  Absolutely awful.  And we had nothing to do with the Friday replay in the middle of the night because no one paid attention to Washington and realized they were running the wrong fucking show today.  That means a lot of people missed the Jim Norton rant yesterday and Anthony's, you know, listening to hotel sex, you know, on the other side of the wall and the Jersey.  I mean, there was a lot of great shit on the show yesterday. 
[00:16:30]  Well, I don't understand why we cannot be a separate entity from D.C.  We shouldn't have to go through.  They should be able to send whatever we're doing here down there to pop out the satellite.  We don't want to go back to D.C. as far as this radio show goes.  We just don't.  Yeah.  We want everything self-contained.  We just, I don't know who's running it down there.  Maybe you're a nice person, but you don't care as much as Aunt Nye. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  That is obvious, okay?  Well, your job down in Washington, D.C. should be, there should be a big fucking switch on the wall and you power up.  That's it.  That means you send the power to us.  Right.  I'll take care of all, I'll take care of everything.  I'll come here at 5 a.m. and play my own music.  It's so much easier.  At least I know that we can take pride in the stuff we're putting on the air.  Yeah, because.  I know what happened.  What happened was they probably, we gave them a list of music and bits we like and comedians we like. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  And then it was obvious that it went into some kind of random program.  So the songs didn't even make sense.  They were too mellow.  It just stunk.  Yeah.  And then you were playing Chris Rock skits from his CDs.  Bad ones.  The bad ones.  Whoever told Chris Rock that he's good at putting skits on his comedy CDs should be shocked.  Just do your stand-up.  Stand-up, unbelievable.  Skits stink. 
[00:18:00]  Didn't we say that yesterday skits stink, Jim?  They certainly do.  Hey, Jimmy.  And you can tell that obviously that there's someone who doesn't know what they're doing  because the same comedy bits get played over and over again in the same spot.  Well, we were starting to solve that problem, you know.  I mean, fair is fair.  We started solving that problem.  I heard a little more variety when I was listening to the first replay yesterday.  A little more variety.  But then the 5 a.m. hour, I mean, that whole hour was put in to get us psyched for the show  and our listeners psyched for the show, some rocking tunes, and then we just expanded. 
[00:18:30]  So now we're calling it like the O&A Variety Hour.  So what it was supposed to be, Anthony, this is how I heard it yesterday when I was on the  phone with the people in Washington, was a bunch of songs we really like, a couple of  comedians that we really like, like a Carlos Mencia, which I did here, and a Brian Regan,  so very good, and then a couple O&A bits.  Yeah.  But I guess we can't start putting the O&A bits in the O&A Variety Hour because Washington  needs 48 hours for some fucking reason.  Yeah, now we've gotten this 48-hour rule where they need a 48-hour heads up on anything 
[00:19:00]  that we want to send down there for them to air.  We need more input on our show.  Not even input.  Give me everything.  Yeah.  I'll come here at 2 in the morning.  I take this seriously.  You know, so now the 5 a.m. hour was just a bunch of music that kind of didn't make sense  because there was no real order.  Then comedians, and then no one realizes that the Chris Rock bit they played had dead air  in the middle of the bit, so like, you know, 40 seconds of dead air happened, and no O&A 
[00:19:30]  bits.  And then no production around it to tell the people what the fuck they're listening to.  That's Radio 101.  I learned that when I was 18.  We're being undermined.  Undermined.  Yeah, there's two problems here.  That one and the sabotage that's going on in this studio.  Oh, man. 
[00:20:00]  You know something?  In a way, I really hope whoever's screwing with this continues.  I really hope they don't stop because eventually, I really hope we catch who's doing this because  it'll be so much fun to just work them over.  Watch them laying on the floor in between the cubicles getting kicked in the liver as  you're spitting out blood because it will happen.  You will get beat up by this show.  You'll be screaming, whining, and crying on the floor as blood is coming out of your mouth 
[00:20:30]  and ears as we kick you in the head with our boots.  And speaking of which, I talked to Washington about the Oompa Loompa.  Yeah.  Okay?  I go, all kidding aside, we're making good radio out of it and stuff, but what the fuck  is this guy's deal?  Why is he here at 530 being our buzzkill when we're trying to get this radio show together?  You know?  I'll tell you right now, man, Washington.  We continue down this road.  Howard's going to kick our fucking asses, okay?  We have enough confidence in our show, we could kick his ass. 
[00:21:00]  We have a funnier show, a more entertaining show.  Our listeners are so much more into our show.  We just need the stuff to work.  But we need the support behind us, okay?  It's do or fucking die.  So, the Oompa Loompa guy, I'm not going to say who told me this, but the Oompa Loompa  guy is convinced that I'm sending him emails threatening him.  Ugh.  I don't have time in the day to send you a fucking email, asshole. 
[00:21:30]  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  Swear to you.  I wasn't going to say anything on the air, but you know what?  Fuck it.  Ugh.  What?  Why do you think it's addressed to him?  Does it say attention or short failures?  He forwarded it down to Washington like, is this considered sexual harassment?  I think Opie's writing me, uh.  Sexual harassment?  No, no.  Whatever.  The other one.  Oh.  The other stupid thing they teach you in human resources.  Because human resources make so much sense when you're doing a radio show.  Basic harassment?  Whatever.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  I.  And then I had to kind of convince, not kind of, I mean, I don't want to call this  person out.  He believed me.  I'm like, look, dude, you honestly think I have time to spend, you know, writing this  guy threatening emails?  I'll tell him to his face.  I wouldn't even know his email address.  Yeah.  Like a pompous to even think we would know his email address or care.  Oompa Loompa.  Go down to where we used to work.  Brooklyn Diner.  Go upstairs and walk the halls and see how I take care of business.  I don't take care of business behind people's back with little email and then go into a 
[00:22:30]  corner and talk bad about someone.  I'll walk right up to you and tell you to your face, you ass.  It's funny.  That's how I work.  And it's not only just in here.  Like they, someone purposely went in there and really messed stuff up in Steve's little  area over there because it's, there's stuff that's way out of whack.  So it's intentional.  Who goes into that studio after we're done and why?  Is that a production room?  Nobody does it when we're here.  Yeah.  They wait until we leave because I walked in here and I've got my little set fucking routine  that I do.  And it's all messed up when I, when I walk in the morning, look, cause I'm trying to 
[00:23:00]  keep, you know, the facts straight here.  Okay.  What I need to know, does someone have to use that area after you're done?  This, these two areas are for us and us only.  That was positive.  Yes.  Cause I'm not, I'm going to, I'm going to raise holy hell after the show as well.  Trust me.  You're sure?  Yes.  There is two other studios down there and then there's the new studio being built over  there.  That's why Steve has to get out of production.  He has to get out of his production studio at noon every day.  For people to use that studio. 
[00:23:30]  Then there's a smaller studio and then they're building another one.  Everywhere we go, we get jealous fucks, but no one uses this or the control room.  After the show gets over, we sit in here cause we don't have our office yet.  So this is where we do our office work.  Yeah.  I sat in here, me and Ope sat in here yesterday for an hour going over stuff.  Kev was still here.  And then I came back and Steve and Eric were still here.  And then we leave and then all hell breaks loose.  Yeah.  And all buttons get pushed and then things go awry.  Oh, push like you wouldn't even believe.  I mean, it doesn't even make sense.  I've been doing radio a long time. 
[00:24:00]  How this board is reconfigured after we leave and how I look at it in the morning, it doesn't  make any sense as far as doing a radio show.  It's just someone going, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink, hitting buttons.  That's it.  We need cameras in here.  Why is nobody from Washington doing anything when you're complaining every day?  Why is nothing being done?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I love being at XM.  I'm having more fun except for today than I've probably ever had in radio. 
[00:24:30]  So let's throw that on the table.  But for some reason, it takes forever to get anything done.  They all, I mean, they go from meeting to meeting to meeting to meeting to meeting in  Washington.  Everything is a meeting, meeting.  It's so corporate, you know?  And these guys, they're brilliant down there.  They're all tech heads.  They're absolutely brilliant.  I, you know, throw that on the table as well.  But this is the first, and there is a lot of talented people down in Washington, by the 
[00:25:00]  way, doing radio, really talented guys.  But this is the first high-profile show that needs a lot of attention and needs to just  think on the fly.  Yeah, we can't be submitting things 48 hours in advance.  I did all sorts of production to, you know, put in this O&A Variety Hour that we're trying  to start up, okay?  It's not on today.  And then I asked Ben and everybody else, they're like, well, they need 48 hours to  implement it into the system, the big master computer down there.  So is that room working now? 
[00:25:30]  Slightly.  No, it's not really working.  No.  No.  It's still not working.  Well, what do we need from that studio today?  Well, when we go to break, we need, you know, we need to throw it in there.  We need to come out of break with the music.  Oh, so how are we going to go into any break?  We can't go into breaks?  Oh, they're just putting their hands up in the air.  I don't fucking know.  That's great.  That's great.  How do we go to break now, Steve?  It's funny, because you really don't know how to go to break?  I'll try to hit the button and see what happens, but I can't hear anything, so I won't really 
[00:26:00]  have any cues, so it's not going to sound pretty.  I am stupefied.  I am stupefied.  I know.  I'm amazed.  Well, it doesn't really matter.  I mean, if the show doesn't work, I mean, there's no one going to any other, like, satellite  companies in a little while that are going to compete for subscriptions, so why get it  right?  I mean, there's really no rush.  Take your time.  Who cares?  This is the time to get our shit together.  Hello?  No rush.  No need to get it fixed.  No competition anytime soon at any other satellite companies.  No big deal.  I'm amazed. 
[00:26:30]  I am really amazed.  I am really amazed.  Dude, we came in here at 4.30, hour and a half of show prep, getting pumped, got our  coffee.  What the fuck is that?  Hey, something just came back.  What do you mean something just came back?  I've been firing off sounds live, so they should be going off live for the past eight  minutes.  That's the first one that just came back.  So see if it fires again.  Just test it.  If this works, okay, so now everything's working.  Okay.  Well, why wasn't it working? 
[00:27:00]  Could someone please find out why it wasn't working?  I'm going to try to find that out right now.  I didn't touch anything.  Oh, great.  And notice who disappeared during all this.  Does anyone notice who's not around all of a sudden?  I don't notice him when he's here.  He's too short.  See, you know what?  I don't know who to accuse you.  You can't accuse anyone.  I don't want to accuse anyone.  I really don't.  Let's put it this way.  Whoever it is is bisexual and they're a failure.  I think it's safe to say that.  They like to do this with other men.  Blah, blah, blah.  That should have been me.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, it's not you, motherfucker. 
[00:27:30]  There are a lot of people that say it should have been me.  Holy shit.  Hit play.  There's a lot of DJs that say it should have been me.  You know what?  You guys never took a chance in your career.  You listened to the bosses over and over again.  You did your two for Tuesdays and your fucking rock blocks and your five o'clock funnies and  your traffic jams.  And you thought, wow, this is going to make me a big time radio star.  And then you watch someone like Anthony and I waltz in and just take over the whole area 
[00:28:00]  and it pisses you off.  Well, tough shit.  You had your chance too.  You just didn't have the balls to go for it.  Those big refrigerator-sized servers that have all of the computers that make this radio  show go off the air, one of the sound cards was pulled out of the back of it.  Why?  You got me.  But they just put it back in and that's why all of a sudden that sound card, that sound  fired off.  Oh, it was pulled out of the back.  So it might not even be someone coming in here.  It might be happening out there.  And it might not be.  It might be happening in the other room.  But I still have the problems.  The buttons are still being changed.  I still have problems with the whole Washington angle, so. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Still have problems with that.  And this thing is supposed to show meters.  Don't even touch this thing today.  Not showing the meters?  What is it showing?  I can't see that screen.  Sound meter level?  An old Flintstones episode?  Honestly, I think we can launch some rockets from here today.  Looks like NASA.  I have no idea.  I didn't get into radio to look at screens like this.  Look at this thing.  This is like, I think this is the Half-Life 2 fucking game code. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  I think we found it.  What the hell is this mean?  That's interesting.  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Shoe.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good, Anthony.  Ah, we're on.  Everything's working.  Great.  There's the meters.  Ah.  Lovely.  Do you want to restart and play the Rage Against the Machine song? 
[00:29:30]  No, you need 48 hours before you can do that.  Yeah, we need 48 hours before you can do anything.  I think it's good, though.  I'm penciling in taking a dump and sending it down to Washington so they know in 48 hours  I'll be evacuating.  Look, people are not used to seeing you freak out.  Wait until they hear this on Thursday in a replay.  They are going to get so irritated.  Why was that not fixed yesterday?  I think I broke my toe, too.  And I really promised myself to stop hitting things.  You kicked something?  People couldn't see you. 
[00:30:00]  I'm almost ready to smash.  People have no idea how close this expensive board came to just getting something smashed  into it.  Very, very close.  If we had a lot more subscribers and I knew I could get away with it, oh yeah, things  would have been broken today.  But I'm smart.  I'm smart!  I'll wait.  I'm smart!  But the garbage pail, I try to kick the garbage pail and you know how you get so in control  you can't line things up?  Yeah.  So I kicked this huge metal pylon instead.  Yeah, he kicked it into me.  And that thing didn't move.  You alright, Ben?  Oh, my toe did.  I'm very injured. 
[00:30:30]  I want the cameras, though.  I want cameras in here.  I want cameras where we can pop it in any time of day or night at home, go to a website  and look at the cameras so we can see.  And that'll keep everyone on their guard.  They want to know who's looking when.  We could review the tape.  The last thing we have to worry about as 6 o'clock rolls around is if we're going on  the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seems simple enough to me.  That seems to be priority one. 
[00:31:00]  Is the show even going to be on the air at 6?  Priority one.  Usually we worry about, do we have enough material for the show?  Yeah.  Does Jim Norton have another rant in him, possibly?  Is Anthony feeling well enough to do a few voices?  That's the stuff we usually have to worry about.  What angle are we going to take with the Yankees and the Sox playoff series?  That type of thing.  Not, uh, uh, guys, I think if you push, uh, those two buttons, uh, you'll at least be 
[00:31:30]  on the air, but you won't be able to hear yourselves and nothing else will work.  I think.  Yeah.  You never want to hear I think.  I think.  Or you never want to see them throw their arms up in the air when asked a question.  Um, no.  We joked about this last week, but I honestly think we should have waited until November 1st.  We still don't have an office.  I thought that was going to be done last week.  That was supposed to be done.  That was supposed to be done on Thursday.  On Thursday.  And remember, I got in trouble for using someone else's desk. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dickhead.  There's no cooperation around here.  And you know what?  We didn't do anything to these guys except come in to do our radio show.  We didn't shove it in their faces.  I couldn't help that there was 20 construction guys, uh, you know, redesigning the whole floor  for us, but we didn't like rub it in their face.  I think Ben ruined it for our relationships with people here because he was playing the radio.  Yeah.  And I get into so many issues with people.  Did that start it?  Yeah.  Well, that was really...  What was the first thing that started?  Because as I remember it, we came in, we shook hands, uh, everything was, was fine. 
[00:32:30]  People were, you know...  I do believe it was hunky-dory.  Right.  What was the first thing that happened?  The first thing was I caught him turning down the music when I went to print something.  I had the music on.  Okay.  He came in.  He said, this is an office environment.  I said, it's five o'clock in the morning.  We're trying to get ready.  He said, that's not even your desk.  You shouldn't be sitting there.  Okay.  All right.  And then I told him to go home and basically told him to go fuck himself.  That's when I kind of lost it back. 
[00:33:00]  Okay, so he started not being too diplomatic.  And let me jump in.  Let me explain to the Oompa Loompa.  The only reason we were sitting at someone else's desk, A, we didn't have our own space  yet because they're building our office, but Bruce, who's a really, really nice guy that  runs the New York facility, like him a lot, he understands what's going on here.  He understands that there's going to be a lot more attention being paid to XM Satellite  Radio, especially in New York because the Opie and Anthony show's in town.  Right.  The Broadway thing's not getting it done, really.  Frank's place is not really getting it done, but that's kind of like cute little spice. 
[00:33:30]  Nice little option to go to.  Nice little options to go to when you're driving around with your 75-year-old effing grandma.  All right?  So there's a place for that.  We understand.  Okay?  Yeah.  Bruce was the one who said, look, guys, blah, blah's not here and blah, blah's not here,  so why don't you use their desk and just try to keep a knee and stuff?  We understand you've got a show to do.  That's the whole reason we started using other people's desks.  All right?  Well, the whole radio thing started off, like you said, okay, because Ben was cranking 
[00:34:00]  the music and then douchebag didn't like the music at 5.30 in the morning, even though  he was the only one that wasn't associated with the Opie and Anthony show out of the  20 people here.  But he got his way for what reason?  Well, I know what reason, because you're a fucking wimp.  I would have shoved it back in his face.  I did.  I turned it back up.  And my problem last week was I had the flu or I would have taken care of business for  you.  But I don't have the flu anymore.  I think we all saw Ben with his face in the monitor getting hollered at by that little  fella standing on a stool. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, Ben couldn't get his face more into the monitor if he tried.  He gave Ben a good talking to.  So now we got the radio back because someone hit it.  I'm going to keep saying someone because I really don't know.  That's right.  I'm not about accusing someone if I don't have my facts completely straight.  I don't like accusing people, too, because when I do find out who it is definitely, I  really like attacking.  So I like waiting until I know absolutely who it is.  And also, the radio didn't start it.  That was just the first time the resentment came out. 
[00:35:00]  The radio didn't start this.  If it wasn't the radio, it would have been something else because it's about the two  names being on the contract and all of a sudden the studio going to you guys and that going  to you guys and that bathroom-sized little studio being built, which is a perfect height  if you're a fucking midget.  So enjoy it back there.  I don't see the New York Times coming in to do a feature story on the Broadway guy and  the Frank Sinatra guy.  I'll give him time.  Do the fucking math, assholes.  So then we finally found the radio, which was hidden.  They finally found it, and we hook it back up. 
[00:35:30]  Now it doesn't get our channel.  So now we can't even play 202 in the office area.  And we usually play 202 out there to get a feel for what the 5 a.m. hour is doing so  we can make it better.  Wait, don't you have to cancel the subscription?  He probably shut it off.  I mean, I'm not...  Well, somebody probably shut it off.  We have no idea.  Someone had to have shut off our channel on that radio, right?  Where was it hidden?  Steve found it somewhere.  Oh, that's classic.  The radio was hidden in a box in the office. 
[00:36:00]  Like in a construction box in an office, upside down.  Really?  Unbelievable.  So do you mean some grown man who actually has to go home and fuck his wife and look  at his kids, hear the radio from other men instead of just standing up and saying what  his problem was?  Some fucking man hid a radio in an office and he still went home and laid his wife back  and put his dick in her like they were an equal in a partnership?  Holy shit!  Who did that?  We don't know.  Who hid the radio? 
[00:36:30]  Honestly, we don't know.  I don't really feel like going to court again.  I don't have any clue.  It's not going to be that hard to figure out because the day it disappeared, that certain  someone was the only person here that would have done that.  None of these other guys would have done that.  Because I went out and then the whole radio was gone.  But now the radio's back, but we can't listen to our channel.  Because somebody unsubscribed that radio.  I don't know, but something happened to me.  Probably went on the computer.  Probably knows how to do it on the computer.  Right, right.  And you just unsubscribed it.  Yeah.  And so then the desk Ben has been using, instead of this person having the balls to go, you 
[00:37:00]  know, guys, I'm a germaphobe or whatever you are.  I don't know.  I really don't like using my computer.  Maybe you could use somebody else's.  He just locked us out of it.  Oh, really?  And then he'll saunter in.  Saunter in, maybe in some loafers, little crease slacks.  Slacks.  Chit-chat in the corner, gossip.  Oh, those two guys should go and hit the road.  I agree.  I like the fact you can suck my cock while you stand up. 
[00:37:30]  I kind of like that.  We have no idea if that's what they're doing.  We know exactly that's what they're doing.  I'm not mentioning any names.  You're a couple of fairies, and you know who you are.  Thanks, fella.  And then, you know, and Sex Bagel heard him talking bad about us, so this is not, you  know, far-fetched.  At least we say what we want to say on the radio.  At least we say it.  And there's no hidden bullshit here.  You say what you want to say.  Ben put his face in the computer and thought it while the guy yelled at him.  Oh, boy. 
[00:38:00]  Such a tension in the workplace.  Oh, well, it's frustrating.  You don't need it.  It's really frustrating.  It should be so easy.  This should be easy.  You come in, we do what we do.  Other people come in, they do what they do.  Bada beep, bada boop.  Yeah, he wants to talk.  He wants to talk.  He wants to program.  And one last thing before we start the show.  I think we've just been too nice.  You know, we've been kind of a...  Well, it has been a week.  Kind of a group of people that are just happy to be here.  Yeah.  But it's time to get things done. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  I did my own research on Long Island.  It's Opie and Anthony's backyard here in New York City.  Yep.  We cut our teeth in radio at WBAB.  When we did gigs when we were at WNEW, we couldn't move at these joints we went to.  Thousands of people showed up, okay?  New York, big market.  So over the weekend, I went home to see the family and stuff, and I went to the Best Buys  and the Circuit Cities.  I kind of mentioned this yesterday.  I went to a few, okay?  There is no clue that we're even on XM Satellite Radio at the Best Buys and Circuit City. 
[00:39:00]  You have no idea.  I've got to put up some posters or something.  Or cardboard displays up by the equipment.  You know, because our fans, most of them don't read.  So they're not getting all the press clippings.  Yeah.  You know, they really don't read.  They need to be told that we're back on the radio on XM Satellite Radio, and I'm just not  seeing that at the place where you buy the units, the Best Buys and Circuit City.  Our channel's not even listed. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  And I know why, because they need new artwork, and I'm sure that'll take at least two to  three months to, you know, update the cardboard things they have on the displays.  This is something that must be worked on.  And then I was walking around the Huntington Festival in Huntington, okay?  A lot of fans coming up to me.  Lots.  I did my own survey, okay?  Ten people.  Two people.  All these are hardcore fans.  Like, listen to every word we said when we were at WNW, okay?  These are hardcore.  They're called P1s in the business, people. 
[00:40:00]  P1s.  Okay?  These were P1s, Anthony.  Out of the ten people I saw, two got the XM, absolutely loved the new show.  Two are thinking about getting XM soon.  Okay?  Six people, and this is the key to this, had no effing idea we're back on the radio.  No clue.  Wow.  Came out to me, so when are you guys coming back?  You know, when is it?  It's been so long.  I'm like, when?  We've been on the radio and this and that. 
[00:40:30]  Did you smack them in the head and say, don't you read or watch television?  Wait, how come I didn't see the billboard in, um, um, oh, there is no billboard.  So, so, uh, do the math, 60% of, uh, the P1s that I surveyed quickly on my little weekend  still have no idea we're back.  Mm-hmm.  Someone's suggesting we ought to put, uh, mousetraps on the board.  Oh, you know. 
[00:41:00]  Go old school with our security.  All right, so they've got to figure out a new system.  We don't want to go to Washington anymore.  We can take care of everything here.  Logically, it doesn't make sense.  Have a big power switch.  So, you know, you don't like what we're doing, you just turn the show off and we'll, we'll  just go away again.  Washington should be there as far as we're concerned.  But give me everything we need to just do the breaks up here.  Washington should be there to relay what we do up to the satellite.  That's it.  There shouldn't be any programming for this show taking place in Washington. 
[00:41:30]  We should be able to do it all here, ship it down there to go right up to the satellite.  Why is there a, a middleman that's programming and, and airing parts of our, our channel and  our show?  It shouldn't happen that way.  Just give me all the work parts and we'll build the, we'll build the breaks up here.  Yeah.  You know what?  Cause it was up, if it was up to Ed and I, we wouldn't have played George Carlin's  House of Blues bit five times last week. 
[00:42:00]  We just wouldn't do that.  Four times.  Would have been good.  You know, I was, I was getting ready to go snooze last night and I like putting on the  TV, watch a little something while I crap out.  And, uh, HBO, one of the HBO channels had George Carlin on and I put it on and I was kind  of, you know, psyched to see it after like 10 seconds.  I was like, uh, no click cause I, I had, I had had it. 
[00:42:30]  I had had it with George Carlin.  They've ruined George Carlin.  We need to take care of everything up here.  That's all.  That's all.  Well, now we have to regroup.  Yeah.  Can we actually regroup or?  Yeah.  We'll regroup.  The sound card's been put back in.  The dilithium crystals are charged and everything's fine.  Everything's fine and dandy.  I wonder how that fell out of the thing though.  That's weird for a sound card to just fall out the back of something. 
[00:43:00]  Fall out.  I don't know.  I just don't know what happened to radio.  The Whopper is ready to play tic-tac-toe.  Everything cool?  Just like everything else in this world, the technology is like getting completely out of  control because I think the geeks want to rule the world.  There's a little overkill on the technology.  There can be overkill.  You know, a lot of this technology is only exciting for probably less, way less than 1%  of the entire population of America.  Those are the people that get off and get hard-ons from all the great technology that's 
[00:43:30]  out here.  Most of us just want to turn on our computer, surf a few websites, and that's about it.  I mean, I got a new phone.  I mean, the book that comes with the phone, it's ridiculous.  I just want to make a couple calls.  If someone wants to text message me, great.  That's about it.  I don't need to know how to launch fucking satellites from my cell phone.  Some people are into it. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, but not as many as you think.  I know.  Not as many as you think.  What?  When we come back, can I give a standing ovation to Ryan O'Neal?  Yeah.  That's a great story, isn't it?  Wow.  There's a lot of great stuff in the paper today.  Man stabbed.  Man staged robbery to impress wife.  Yeah, that's a great one.  What a pussy-whipped ass this guy is.  A couple allegedly had sex at the Alamo.  Hoo-hoo, ripping us off. 
[00:44:30]  Hey, that gives me a great idea for a contest.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I wonder what that would be.  Norton banged an 11 last night.  Sex for Santa Ana.  Yeah.  Hey, the first chuckle today.  There you go.  And Dead Man keeps paying bills.  That's a great one.  That's a great example of technology gone awry.  All right, maybe we'll start with that next.  Yeah.  The Astros clinched last night.  The Sox.  The Sox, yeah.  But you guys are a bunch of pussies.  Sox crying. 
[00:45:00]  I'll tell you why next.  Sox fans crying.  They don't like one of the...  And I'm rooting for the Sox, but now...  You know what?  Yeah, stay rooting for the Sox.  Don't lose your loyalty right now.  Yeah, please, Opie.  You've got to stick with them.  Keep rooting for them with your sports curse.  They're a bunch of pussies, though.  They don't like one of the t-shirts that's making the rounds.  And by the way, what's with the local news here in New York showing Yankee Stadium at,  you know, 6 o'clock in the morning with the baboons?  They've been showing it at 5 o'clock in the morning.  They were going to Yankee Stadium for the live shot.  Here we are, Yankee Stadium. 
[00:45:30]  When's the game start?  You know what's going to be great?  When the guy gets stabbed, you know?  Yeah.  Live report.  Yo, man, you got some change?  I'd like to see him come up to the camera.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Yo, man, you got some change?  As he pulls out a sharpened screwdriver.  The weapon of choice.  Also, a guy spent $25,000 to go from dud to stud.  Buying into that myth.  This is in the New York Post.  You've got to check out the picture of the guy.  What?  The guy watches much too much television, listens to much too much... 
[00:46:00]  e-entertainment news, and thinks this is the way to go to get chicks.  It's the whole queer eye for the straight guy thing, which is...  It's not working.  Castrating the men.  It's not working.  Guys want to be guys.  Yep.  You should see how faggy this guy looks in the post today.  This is the myth that this is what women want.  It's the myth that's being spread around.  And it just ain't true.  Except for a couple of fag hags.  Also, Michael Jackson dissing Eminem. 
[00:46:30]  See?  We did our part today.  Did Michael Jackson diss?  Is he even capable of dissing anybody?  I don't know.  A diss?  That's a good point.  You guys...  You know he fights like a girl.  You've got to be able to back your diss up with something.  With a punch.  A man's punch.  Maybe.  A little bit.  And then a lot of controversy that...  A lot of people think that Bush was wearing a wire during the debate.  The picture's pretty interesting.  There's something in his back.  I thought of that before I was actually watching it. 
[00:47:00]  What is that little thing running up his back?  It was his battery pack.  Something.  All right.  Well...  There was something back there.  If it was...  If he worked here, it wouldn't be working.  Whatever it was.  All right.  We got lots to do, so...  This is XM satellite radio on his back.  So, Steve.  Hopefully, this will work.  I swear to God.  Oh, boy.  Just tell me what...  Clear the field if this doesn't work.  Tell me what you want taken out.  The screens? 
[00:47:30]  No, you can't break the screens, because you're going to need them.  How about somebody's desk?  Start simple.  Remember when I used to try to pull out the board at the old place that was, like, screwed  down?  That never worked.  Take the keyboard for your computer and smash it across the mic stand if it doesn't work.  That's...  All right.  Deal.  I say you smash it on the floor, because if you hit the mic stand, old Jimmy Norton may  lose an eye.  Or Big Kev.  Would that matter?  No, you're probably right.  I think you'd look good with a patch.  A pirate patch.  You could go around saying, R. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Come here.  Let me give you money to put this in your mouth.  All right.  Yeah, you're right.  R.  45 minutes into the show, and we'll get it started, hopefully next.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Oh, that's Rock King Friday.  Work the tanks.  Ooh.  Mr. Rogers is about to come in your fist hole.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, my name is Jessica.  I'm calling with the newspaper.  Do you know who'd be in charge of renewing the subscription? 
[00:48:30]  Uh, I am right now.  Actually, it looked like it was just recently started.  It just hasn't been paid for yet.  Okay, so what do I have to do?  Um, I can take a checker credit card over the phone.  Okay, can I have the address?  P.O. Box 501.  I didn't pick up what you just said.  Okay, it's McLean, Virginia.  M-C-O.  M-C-L-E-A-N, Virginia.  Okay, and then I just send it to that address, and that's 90725, right? 
[00:49:00]  P.O. Box 5016.  570.  5016.  57046.  All right, well, maybe you could just give me your address.  I just gave you the address.  But you went so fast, ma'am.  If I can give it to you one more time.  I know, but I just want to make sure I've got the right address.  P.O. Box 501 McLean.  Is that used to be McLean again?  M-C-L-E-A-N, Virginia. 
[00:49:30]  B-E-A-N, 2-2-1-0-2.  Whoa, slow down.  Are you going to a fire or something?  Is there anything else I can help you with?  When do I have to mail the check?  You mail the check out, and we receive it by May 22nd.  You will not have any disruption.  So how many weeks would that be?  I can't tell you the exact date.  Okay, you started the subscription.  We give you a certain amount of time to send the check in.  But I have a whole checkbook of when I send my checks out.  Well, then you're going to have to send us a copy of...  I've never seen a check like that before.  Well, then, because you didn't pay for it. 
[00:50:00]  I know, but how is he going to pay for it when he doesn't know when he has to mail the check in?  May 22nd.  Yeah, May 22nd.  That's what you said before.  It has to be mailed in by May 22nd, or the paper will stop.  There's a lot of knuckleheads out there, and I don't know if I'll get the check out in time.  The paper's going to stop if we don't receive a check.  I know, but it's only going to pay for it.  They're just going to check me out.  If you'd like to check into it and give us a call back, I gave you the customer service number of 1-800.  Now, is that going to be a toll on my phone bill?  No, it's toll-free.  Because I don't have long distance. 
[00:50:30]  It got switched off.  Okay, is there anything else I can help you with?  Okay, how much is it to get it for a year?  For a year, it's $119.  Does this delivery include the Sunday paper?  No, it's only Monday through Friday.  They don't even show it on the newsstand for the Sunday paper?  We don't have a Saturday or Sunday paper at all.  The one I'm getting now, it comes on the weekend.  Well, you have all the information, so if you would like to continue with the...  And the check's for $139 for the six months, right?  No. 
[00:51:00]  Three months at six months.  That's what you said, ma'am.  You said $139 for six months.  No, I didn't.  Including the weekends.  I'm sorry.  If you have any other questions, please call the customer service number.  I do have a question, miss.  I don't know why.  Okay, then you're going to...  We're having a problem.  Okay, well, I don't think that I can help you because I'm telling you some information  and you're saying something completely different back to me.  I've tried to give you the information.  I miss, I know.  We're just trying to ask a couple of questions. 
[00:51:30]  Okay, well, I don't think I can assist you any further, but I can answer your customer service number.  No, I don't mean to come to me.  I just want to know when I'm in the mail and check out...  It has to be mailed by May 22nd.  Jessica, I'm getting very confused with all these voices.  I know.  For some reason, I keep hearing all these different voices, too.  I'm sorry if I'm unable to help you any further.  I gave you our customer service line.  But why can't we...  I asked you the question...  Because I cannot answer that for you.  I don't have that information.  Miss, what was...  I gave you all the information...  Why are you yelling at me?  I'm not yelling.  I'm just telling you I gave you all the information I have and I can't help you any further. 
[00:52:00]  But it's just a simple question.  Yes, and I'm sorry.  I guess I can't answer a simple question.  The other thing is, do we have a confirmation number?  There is no confirmation number.  Just let them know you spoke to Jessica.  Yeah, but there's probably a lot of Jessicas that work for...  No, there isn't.  I'm the only one.  And I'm sorry.  I have to go...  You're the only one.  You're the only Jessica that works for...  I don't believe you.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony. 
[00:52:30]  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child.  You're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Want to say hi to everyone that turned on their radios overnight to check out this mess that will get better. 
[00:53:00]  They call it growing pains, but it's getting completely ridiculous.  I've got tumors all over my body from these growing pains.  By the way, I've got to call them out every single time now.  The Jim Florentine bit that we just played into break.  He's a friend of the show.  Very funny guy.  I've heard that freaking prank call, I want to say a million times, but too many times.  Yeah, I don't know why they have the same material. 
[00:53:30]  I don't even know, man.  Four CDs full of stuff.  Four CDs filled with stuff.  When I was listening to the replays over the weekend, I heard that bit at least twice.  So that was not our doing.  Yeah, we should.  We're all about variety on this show.  We don't try to pound things into the ground, except for when we're bitching like this.  Anymore.  Did I say anymore?  No, I remember the...  Yeah, we used to pound crap into the ground, but we've had two years to think about our show, 
[00:54:00]  and we made some adjustments.  If you think about it.  All right, let's try to get into a show here, okay?  Mm-hmm.  You banged an 11 last night, Jimmy?  You bet I did.  Made up for that mess from the other night?  Yeah.  Jimmy's version of an 11 is not everyone else's version of an 11.  It's 2-1 standing side by side.  I've seen you point out girls that you feel are very attractive, and they're just not. 
[00:54:30]  Dude, this girl is great.  I'll show you her body on the computer.  I'll show you.  Was it a Columbus, Ohio 11 or a New York City 11?  South Jersey?  A South Jersey 11.  That's like a New York 5.  No, no, no.  No way, dude.  Because this whole counting thing, it depends what state you're in.  You go to South Beach, you look like a genetic disaster compared to the people walking around down there.  You cannot walk around South Beach, man.  For the price.  The chicks down there, it's ridiculous. 
[00:55:00]  You know, usually when you see a hot girl, especially in New York City, okay?  Mm-hmm.  I think I can speak for most guys.  You get really into looking at them because deep down somewhere, not even deep down sometimes,  sometimes you're like, I can have her, right, at surface level.  I can have her.  But then they're really hot.  There's always a part of you that goes, you know what?  If the circumstances were right, I could have sex with that girl, right?  Attainable.  Okay.  I went to South Beach with Rich Voss, and we're sitting there watching the talent walk by. 
[00:55:30]  Did you two just rent a motor home for the past two years and motor around the country?  Every time you say, I was somewhere, it involves Rich Voss.  No, because I followed Norton for a while.  I followed Stephen Lynch.  I became a comedy groupie.  I really did.  Like they're the Grateful Dead, and you're just going around selling spaghetti in the  parking lot for pot money and acid.  What else was I going to do?  Nothing.  But that's how a guy thinks, pretty much, in your hometown. 
[00:56:00]  You know, you look at, there's not many girls you're going to see in New York City where  you don't think if the circumstances were right, you couldn't bang them, okay?  All right.  South Beach, we're checking out the talent walking by.  They were so unbelievably hot that it was depressing.  It was absolutely depressing because you knew you didn't have a shot.  You know, there was no circumstances that you could figure out in your head where I could  bang that.  It just ain't going to happen.  They're online, outside all those clubs.  And they're all standing outside on line. 
[00:56:30]  You walk past.  You don't even consider going in.  Don't even think about it.  So these Latinos are walking.  I mean, every type of woman you could think of, man.  The pooh-ha that was walking by.  Anyway, so I was so depressed, and I'm with Voss, so we called Norton.  I go, Norton, I need to know something.  What am I in, like, New York City terms?  What did you say, like a six or something?  I give you a seven.  All right, a seven. 
[00:57:00]  I'm like, if I'm a seven in New York City, I'm like a three and a half down here.  I'll put it to you this way.  From August of 2002 to October of 2004, you're like a five and a half.  Yeah, the gig definitely brings the number up.  October 1st on, you may be up to an eight and a quarter.  Oh, yeah.  The gig definitely brings on the quality pooh-ha.  That's for sure.  So I'm like, you gave me a seven, really?  So I was like a three or four in South Beach, which means Voss is like a one and a half.  Well, Voss is tan, and he has good abs, and he kind of looks like some sort of Dominican 
[00:57:30]  rat.  So I would give Voss a higher number.  Dominican rat.  Because he down there looks like he should be mewling something in his anus.  He fits in in Miami.  Who is the other guy that looks exactly like us, but he has little turtle hands?  So, I mean, if you want to look like a genetic freak, go down to South Beach.  And by the way, when you look at a girl like that and you go, wow, how can I talk to her?  You know, sometimes it's just about going up, and you'd be surprised if you talk to somebody  a little bit.  When they look one way, you slip a little something into the drink. 
[00:58:00]  You'd be surprised when they fall and clunk their head on a dumpster.  Or exactly how much fun you can have.  And now you're the good Samaritan.  I'll take her home.  I'll take her home.  Oh, look at that nice guy.  I know her.  Good friend of mine.  A comment on Jim and rating girls.  There was an email sent around by Steve to the group of us about some chick that was,  I thought, disgusting looking.  And I commented, Jim comments back, oh, she's sexy.  She's sexy.  Dude, are you out of your mind?  Yeah, Jim finds some sexiness in anything.  In anything.  No, I don't, but she was, I know the girl, I don't want to say her name because she's  a listener and she's really cool, but she was a very, there was something very sexy about 
[00:58:30]  her.  Like, if you're looking for, like, perfect Pam Anderson, all right, no, but so what?  It doesn't mean that she's not sexy.  All right.  So.  I'm a good guy like that.  I find something good in everyone.  You certainly do.  Might all want to take that little bit of advice.  You certainly do.  That is inspiring.  If you have a vag and you're over, like, 95 degrees, I find some redeeming quality in  you.  Over 95 degrees.  That means you could be dead for 15 minutes.  Yeah, you got to give it a little time.  Anything under 90 would be silly.  So, an 11 yesterday? 
[00:59:00]  For Craigslist.  I was on Craigslist and the price was, usually, like, for a really good escort to come over,  it's like 300, 350.  I can't spend that time on it.  I can't do it.  This was 150 plus cab fare.  It was like 175 for full service, which is.  So, 175 and you're having sex.  Yeah, but I thought it was going to be some kind of scab.  She comes over, like, 34 Ds, great little body, like an L.A. blonde, really, really sexy.  Really?  Yes.  And she's on the computer?  Yeah, I'll show you the picture. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, show me, show me.  On the next break, I'll run over it, and then I'll show you the picture real quickly,  and then we'll be right back on the air.  She was really, really sexy.  Wow.  Gave me what they call a BBBJ.  BBBJ?  What's that?  I don't know if I want to tell you.  Bareback.  Bareback blowjob.  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what that could possibly be.  No bag, silly.  Oh, oh, oh, bareback.  Okay, wow.  Very rare for that to happen.  Very rare.  But they can look at me and just see that I'm a stepper.  And then, what about the sex there? 
[01:00:00]  It was actually really good.  Condom?  I only did a half hour.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't do it out of condom.  I'm a nut.  Wink.  But I actually did, I did wear a bag, of course, and I wanted her to put her, like, I kind of  have a thing, like, sometimes you want a girl's, like, ass by your face.  Not to be dirty, like, I wasn't going to lick it, but just to go, you know what I mean?  Sometimes you just want to...  You want to enjoy every sense.  I'm into that, yeah.  The sight, the smells, the tastes, everything, right? 
[01:00:30]  She's like, no, no, not until I know you better.  She wouldn't let you take a sniff?  Nah, I said...  Not until I know you better.  You're paying!  I think she was being diplomatic.  It might have been a long day.  You know, she might have just got done reading a paper, if you know what I mean.  Oh, gotcha.  Yeah.  Was she horrified?  No, I'm always nice to girls that come over like that.  Why do they be horrified?  I'm very nice to them.  What if you wanted to stick it in the can?  Was she into that, or...?  Well, here's what you do.  You talk to them beforehand, you go, do you speak Greek?  If they speak Greek...  Do you speak Greek?  Yes, that's how you ask.  Would you like to...  Yes.  You want to be scatets? 
[01:01:00]  You want to be scatets?  Could you provide me with Greek lessons?  And they say no, or they say yes.  I'm not into that.  What if you ask them if they speak Hoboken?  What do you get for that?  I've kind of stumped on there.  Wow.  That's good to be a comic with no improv skills.  Well, I guess they'll be from Jersey, Hope.  Go ahead.  Throw them at me.  I got them.  This is just like Second City.  We're all just riffing and doing characters.  When I touch you, now you freeze.  And you give me the guy's watch, and then I'll punch his wife in the throat. 
[01:01:30]  Someone yell out an occupation.  Someone.  Child pornographer!  Okay.  You're a child pornographer.  And you work in a deli.  Go.  Ugh, improv.  It stinks.  Never funny.  Never.  I'll say the only improv I've ever seen that I really admired was in Canada.  When I did this gig in Montreal, there's this Canadian improv group that is brilliant,  and they're really funny.  98% of it sucks, and it's sanctimonious, and it's idiotic.  Unless the improv is having sex with a moose on stage up there in that cold country. 
[01:02:00]  I don't want to see it.  Yeah, I normally don't like it either.  Oh, improv.  Yeah.  Okay, we're going to do, you two get into the act, and then another comic, when the  bell rings, you freeze, he'll tap you out and take up where...  Freeze tag, it's called.  Freeze tag.  Ugh.  But that crap is...  As an audience member, I want to tag someone at the door so I can leave and he can take  my seat.  That's freeze tag.  But that crap is all written in advance.  Most of it is, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  I say 97.  And most people are sitting there thinking they're so brilliant.  That's all written.  They know where they're going with that crap.  Oh, boy, they're so funny and spontaneous.  When all of a sudden they have to sing a goofy song to a melody.  Oh, they're really making that up in their head on the fly.  Wrong.  I can't get through one rhyme doing that Bruce Springsteen crap.  No.  I do one, and then I'm stumped for the next one.  I always know when you're out of rhymes, when you start going,  Whoa!  Exactly.  That's the out of rhyme sound. 
[01:03:00]  Because I can't rhyme anything with ass.  Well, we can seg into this dud or stud thing that's in the New York Post today.  Dud or stud?  This guy spent $25,000 to go from dud to stud.  Look at the picture.  Let me read just a little bit.  What an idiot.  Buying the myth.  The guy has classic bologna tits.  Huge beer belly.  His name's Steve.  Classic bologna tits.  It's like Joey Paisano.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you better take that back, my friend. 
[01:03:30]  Look at his face.  It looks like him.  No, it does look like a chubbier Joey Paisano.  Yeah, the face.  The face.  Just the face.  Well, Joe's not a physical mess, but this guy's face is going to end up in a field in Queens.  Eh?  His name's Steve.  He used to be an ugly duckling, but after spending $10,000 on plastic surgery, plus another $15,000  on personal training, Steve transformed himself from a grumpy 230-pound big cake eater to a  muscle-bound 160-pound stud. 
[01:04:00]  No, they made him gay.  They turned him into a gay man.  They turned him gay.  He seemed to be an overweight but, you know, manly kind of guy, and turned him into a gay man  because he bought the myth, the myth of all those stupid TV shows that are on now.  He's got the wife beater t-shirt when he's a dud, and now they put him in one of those  faggy t-shirts, you know, the kind you see where, the only way I can explain, you dip  a paintbrush in, like, brown paint and then just throw the paint on a shirt a few times? 
[01:04:30]  Well, it's dabbed on strategic areas to try to make him look slimmer, Opie.  Look, it's by his abs and by his pecs and his biceps.  It's supposed to highlight areas where now you're supposed to look slimmer.  I love that.  The clothes will make you look slimmer.  Wasn't that something chicks just did?  Guys aren't supposed to be like, yeah, I wear this because it makes me look more trim.  They're buying the myth.  They watch the shows, the Queer Eye shows, and assume that this is what women now want. 
[01:05:00]  Because years ago, it was very rare for a guy to take such attention to himself and not  be gay. So he was the standout guy. And the chicks were attracted to him. But now every  Tom, Dick, and Harry is going through these metamorphoses into this metrosexual thing,  they like to call it, where, yeah, I'm straight, but I'm dressing and taking care of myself like  I'm a gay guy. I use the face. I use an exfoliating scrub every morning. 
[01:05:30]  And the fact of the matter is now, chicks aren't into this.  And the queer guys come in and they take away all your cool stuff.  All your cool, comfortable stuff. They set you up with fag wear and other gay accoutrements  in your house, gay furniture. And now this is supposed to be something you want and you're  going to be happy with.  Ugh.  I don't need pants with a hamster tube latch in the back. 
[01:06:00]  Where do you get those clothes? With a trap door. Everything's got a trap door in the  back.  I did a little math, by the way. 25,000 divided by 150. That's 166.66 prostitutes this idiot  could have gotten.  Oh, wow.  You know how much sex that is? This idiot.  And he's doing this probably to get women.  Of course he is.  And it would have been easy enough to just ask if they speak Greek.  Yeah, exactly.  Hand over some dollars.  Or speak Hoboken.  Speak Hoboken.  Even though we don't know what that means yet. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Yeah, I'll think of something.  When you wake up.  I don't know.  And this guy will go back to being a dud.  Oh, yeah.  None of these ever last.  This crap never works.  Never lasts.  He's probably going out now, though, and trying to work the scene with his new look and his  new clothes.  Just stop it.  What an ass.  You know, I am into...  That guy's got to be getting a lot of abuse from his co-workers today.  And his friends. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine if one of us came in after a huge makeover like that?  Just be getting ragged on.  This guy's going back to the job site looking like the stud picture.  Hey.  Yeah, they're being very cooperative.  You want to hand me the Sawzall, Pete?  Right.  Come on.  Oh.  Where's the drill dough?  I got to rip my pants down.  But no, they're not.  They're probably being very supportive.  In the modern day work environment, everybody's very supportive.  Looks good. 
[01:07:30]  You look good.  You look great.  Yeah.  What have you done to yourself?  Lose some pounds?  And the fat secretary that works there.  Oh, you look fantastic.  I bet the ladies are just pawing after you.  Ugh.  And she has the secretary sign of you can ask the man who's in charge or the woman who knows what's going on.  Oh, you're a funny one, aren't you?  Oh, she's a card, that one.  He'll be back to his jeans and T-shirts in no time. 
[01:08:00]  Wow, I'm still not getting laid.  Yeah.  I spent 25 grand and I'm still not getting it.  I thought I would get pussy looking like this.  Oh, well.  You know, I could go out to a store and afford some of those sporty homo clothes.  Jigs.  Why the hell bother?  Okay.  What are you going to get?  The fag head?  They don't screw anyway.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  Speaking of all this, I found another bit we're allowed to play. 
[01:08:30]  Our listeners are helping us out big time, by the way.  Are they reminding us of...  Not even reminding.  When we got kicked off the radio two years ago and we weren't allowed back in our office  to get our stuff, not only did they take all the stuff that we did with Infinity Broadcasting,  they took all our stuff that we brought to the table way before that.  They took everything away.  Absolutely everything we ever did.  So the listeners are slowly but surely emailing us some old stuff that we're allowed to play  because it has nothing to do with Infinity Broadcasting, okay? 
[01:09:00]  And this makes sense with the stutter dud thing.  Remember the Hi, Mom, I'm Gay?  Ah, who could forget?  All right, Bob, are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm Gay?  Absolutely.  Now I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay?  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob, let's give it a shot.  All right.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me, darling? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  It's Bobby.  Bobby?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah?  Well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, Mom, you sitting down?  Why?  I've got to tell you something.  What?  Uh, don't get nervous.  That's what I've been meaning to tell you.  I was going to call and tell you when you called earlier today.  Yeah?  I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s***.  I'm a twinkie.  I swear it.  Bobby, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you never believe me? 
[01:10:00]  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Bobby.  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Bobby.  What?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm not.  I had to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right.  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Bobby, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  You can tell your father that.  I'm not even going to bring it up.  All right. 
[01:10:30]  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people.  So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it's to throw everyone off, you know?  Bobby, I don't believe it.  However, you know...  You still love me?  I haven't had enough heartache.  I think, you know...  You still love me?  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh?  What the hell are you doing?  Drinking?  No.  No.  Yeah, all right, all right.  Okay, I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No, I was going to spring it on him tonight.  Yeah, that's nice. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, you do that.  Stand a long distance away, will you?  I will, out of arm's reach.  Bobby, don't give me that baloney, please.  You break my heart when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus!  Dude!  I got to get back to her quick, man.  She ain't got to put a knife in her wrist.  You better do that.  Evil and loving it. 
[01:11:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I almost broke my vagina.  Drink until she's pretty.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, what are you saying?  How are you, man?  Hello.  Good night.  How are you?  Happy Saturday.  Good evening. 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  I don't get right into the heavy shit, you know.  Got to goof around a little bit first, you know.  Get used to being here.  First I was back there.  Now I'm here.  Everybody's looking.  Makes you nervous, you know. 
[01:12:30]  You get nervous, too, don't you?  Audiences have nerves, I think.  I know.  Kind of a show tension, you know.  Waiting for the time and the signal and the lights and the music and the show.  And you get a little nervous because you know you represent your row, right?  Don't want to be laughing at the wrong stuff, you know.  Sit with your foot in a dopey position.  But I kind of goof around first, you know.  Look at that.  Found a staple. 
[01:13:00]  See?  Nobody goes right to work.  It's true.  You might get there on time, but screw the company.  Those first 20 minutes belong to you, right?  It's not an attitude in line with the American spirit, but there it is.  We all screw around first.  I just got here, man.  You kidding me?  Yeah.  Really, you never see a memo that says 901. 
[01:13:30]  People don't jump out of bed and vacuum, right?  See?  Stand around in the office a little.  Look at the picture for a while.  Notice there's a duck in it.  Been there eight years.  Never saw the duck before.  You're good for half an hour if you have a window in your office, right?  Yeah.  Especially if they're building something across the street, maybe.  Some guy come in and do 90 minutes on struts. 
[01:14:00]  You need some beams and struts here.  You need some 3-8-inch beams.  You want to get AC power in here.  You knock a false hole in the steel and you run conduit.  You run conduit straight down there.  Some beams and struts and you got it at a perfect angle in the corner.  Anyway, this is my job.  Welcome to my job, man.  It's my job.  Everybody doesn't have an audience on their job.  Might be nice if they did, though. 
[01:14:30]  Have three people sitting on the other side of your desk.  Yes, hey, he's okay.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Staring at my shoes.  Trying to think of something.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's a freak show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  I say, don't you know.  You say you don't know. 
[01:15:00]  I say.  Take me out.  I say you don't show.  Don't move.  Time's low.  I say.  Take me out.  Another George Carlin bit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  Another bit from the same comic that we've been hearing for the last week.  Well, we've been bitching about that for a week, so.  I don't get it.  Maybe today's rap, you know, down in Washington, can be perceived as one of the guys who are 
[01:15:30]  out of control.  We're still trying to work out the bugs in the system, but the George Carlin thing should  have been figured out by now.  I think it's a good idea because in comedy.  George Carlin is one of my favorite comedians of all time.  He's the greatest.  I now hate him.  Here's the way it works in comedy.  When you hear a joke you like or a bit, you should always hear it eight or nine times  in a two-day period.  Just makes it funnier and funnier.  Oh, you never get sick of it.  Because Carlin really doesn't have a body of work that covers more than like one or two 
[01:16:00]  bits, so I guess that they've found both of them and they're playing them.  And they're probably complaining, oh, it's a bit.  That's a new bit.  Perhaps they think our channel is for Alzheimer's patients, because then it wouldn't matter,  would it?  You know what?  This is a funny bit.  Listen to this one.  I'm going to go out on a limb.  I'd rather hear Richard Lewis than another George Carlin bit.  Oof.  I like Richard Lewis.  You pussy.  I do.  I worked with him and he had the worst show of his career.  I saw him get booed off at Caroline's.  I felt bad.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I really felt bad. 
[01:16:30]  What show is that?  Late show at Caroline's.  A long time ago.  How about Carrot Top on the radio?  That'd be good.  He could describe his props.  I'd rather.  I would rather.  Look at what he's made out of a toilet seat.  It's hysterical.  I'd rather hear Gallagher smash the pumpkin.  Watermelon.  Watermelon.  Wow.  I'd rather listen to that.  Wow.  We're just making Washington look stupid.  We really are.  Because we've been bitching about the George Carlin thing forever. 
[01:17:00]  If they're not going to fix that, what else are they not going to do for us?  Uh-oh.  All right.  The Sox and the Yankees going at it starting tonight, right?  Oh, quickly.  Jimmy showed me the chick that he was with last night on the website.  That a boy.  Not bad.  That a boy.  Hey, guys.  36D, natural, slender yet curvy in all the right places.  Long, blonde hair, big green eyes.  22 years old.  Really?  Was she 22?  Yeah.  Really?  I think so. 
[01:17:30]  All-American Cali girl.  100% independent.  Not affiliated with any agency.  Right.  What agency?  Does that mean she doesn't have a pimp?  No CIA.  Yeah.  No black eyes for her?  She's agency, man.  They're all agency.  No, we, uh, no one likes the agencies because they bait and switch.  They always send you different girls.  The agencies suck.  You gotta go with independence.  Bait, vagina, switch, penis?  Yeah.  That pretty much it?  No, no, nothing that good.  It's always that they'll...  But you look at the ad and she looks really hot and then you call the number and then they  send over a mess?  Yeah.  Does the mess at least look like the girl in the picture at all? 
[01:18:00]  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Um, I've had a few real soup kitchen disasters show up.  Oh.  And how does the mess explain that she's not the girl in the photo?  Oh, because they'll, like, what they'll do is they'll say, yeah, it's me that you're  talking to, like, on the phone.  And they'll say that it's them in the ad.  But then the girl shows up and you know that that's not the girl you just talked to on  the phone.  They're like, I don't know why they said that.  Well, what do they say?  Oh, they...  Oh, okay.  You know it's not their fault.  They're just getting sent over.  I'm thinking they're going to try to, you know, faking.  Oh, no, I happen to have the flu.  No, I'm a nice guy. 
[01:18:30]  I'll always hand them money and dehumanize them.  All right.  It says donations, donation specials, donation, huh?  Donation specials are $150 for a half hour, $250 for the full hour.  Yeah.  I offer real great girlfriend experience.  Yeah.  Wow.  That means kissing and a little bit of tender touching.  Oh, really?  GFE, yeah.  That's the girlfriend experience?  Yeah.  And FS.  Yes.  Not the nagging being a twat part.  That would be the real girlfriend experience.  Oh, jeez.  You want to get late and she just talks while the game is on and then you choke her and 
[01:19:00]  throw her out the window.  Girlfriend experience.  No sense.  Just put on your favorite movie and I'll babble like a dumb whore right when Kay says to Michael,  Michael, is it true?  And then that tension before he answers, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You fucking idiot.  I had that happen with a girl.  I knew this girl was not for me.  We watched The Godfather and Diane Keaton says, Michael, is it true?  And in that tension, this fucking idiot talks. 
[01:19:30]  It's like, how can you talk when that's happening?  The whole film is led up to that.  Right.  And you speak.  Dummy.  That's hilarious.  And FS.  A girlfriend experience.  What's FS?  Full service.  Full service.  Or Frank sucks.  That's sexual intercourse?  Yeah.  And I think full service would imply oral and regular, yeah.  Wow.  A lot of them won't do full service though.  And she did, she gave you a BJ without a condom.  Yeah.  Well, watch that strong language. 
[01:20:00]  Yes.  I'll try.  Yeah, she did.  It was nice.  But you finish up in the condom when you're having sex.  Oh, I was an eight second finisher.  You can't blast her in the face, right?  Some will let you do facials.  I have one that just does massage.  She's like, no full service, no sex.  She's really hot though.  And she does massage.  We're in the middle of it.  And she goes, for an extra 50, I'll put on a dildo and stick it in your ass.  Ooh, that's a treat.  Yeah, I didn't do it.  I'm not into that.  But she's like, I kind of like it.  She wanted to do it.  She put it on and showed me. 
[01:20:30]  I'm like, yeah.  Don't stop treating me like a hooah.  A hooah.  Best clip ever.  Don't stop treating me like a hooah.  All right, let's talk about the socks and the Yankees.  Socks.  The fag socks.  Jesus.  God, they're getting a little upset, aren't they?  Yeah, my team.  Over a t-shirt?  My team is letting me down.  That's okay.  They've complained to the point that Major League Baseball has pulled a t-shirt that is being  sold here in New York.  Major League Baseball, the NFL. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, they all are taking the fun out of sports.  You know?  This isn't like you're lobbing batteries at people from the stands.  This is a t-shirt.  It's not like you're pelting Santa Claus with snowballs like they like to do in Philly.  That's great.  This is just a t-shirt.  Where's the shirt?  In your workbook.  It's page 12.  Turn to page 12 in your workbook.  I don't know if it's the Daily News or the Post.  I don't know.  And it's not even vulgar.  It's not... 
[01:21:30]  No, let me read this really fast.  It's a little ribbing.  Or a little part of it, anyway.  A little fun-spirited ribbing.  Who's your daddy?  Who's being a baby?  That's how this starts.  On the eve of the Yanks showdown with Boston for the American League Championship, wimpy Boston  Red Sox fans yesterday forced Major League Baseball to stop selling a t-shirt that hurts  their fragile feelings.  By the way, get rid of all the calls, because I know the Red Sox fans are going to call like  crazy now.  Oh, I don't know.  It should be up. 
[01:22:00]  Is it up?  No, it's not.  That's good.  It was up before.  No, this is good when you're in the flow and trying to do a story that you have to stop  to try to figure out how to make another machine work that was working yesterday.  It was working just earlier.  No, this is great.  This is great for comedic timing.  There you go.  Stop whining.  There you go.  That was great.  That would have been good right after you're reading the clip about Boston whining.  Stop whining.  I'm going to rewind, Anthony.  I'm going to rewind.  All right.  So in the paper today, it says, who's your daddy? 
[01:22:30]  Who's being a baby?  Uh-huh.  On the eve of the Yanks showdown with Boston for the American League Championship, wimpy  Boston Red Sox fans yesterday forced Major League Baseball to stop selling a t-shirt  that hurts their fragile feelings.  Stop whining.  There you go.  All right.  So we're going to get this down after all.  The message on the shirt that set Fenway fans to whining reads, who is your daddy?  It kind of says that, actually.  It says, hey, Red Sox, who's your daddy? 
[01:23:00]  Right.  The shirt bears a Yankees logo and a picture of a red pacifier with the letter B on it.  Aw.  And this upset the Boston fans.  Upset the Boston fans.  It upset them.  You know what?  It didn't upset.  I'm going to stick up for the Boston Red Sox fans.  Oh, yeah.  Try to spin this, because they're the ones that were bitching and complaining about it.  I don't think it upset the real hardcore Boston Red Sox fans, because they wear their own  shirts that are pretty brutal, okay?  I think it's those fringe fans that want to go to the game with their families, and they're 
[01:23:30]  sitting there paying all that money, and all of a sudden they see a shirt like this.  That isn't even offensive, though.  It's not.  I understand.  Who's your daddy?  It's not an offensive shirt, but I'm telling you the mindset of the person that's being  offended.  I don't think it's the hardcore Boston Red Sox fan that is drinking and smoking before  the games and really getting into it.  It's the suburb people up there.  It's the soccer moms that go with their family and their little kids.  Wait, did you read the responses to some of the... 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, I'm getting there.  The quote comes from Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez, who was lamenting a recent butt-kicking  by the Bombers.  Major League Baseball began offering the shirt for wholesale distribution to league-licensed  retailers over the weekend and promoted it on a website.  Complaints from fans, most of them from Boston, started pouring in right away.  Some may have feared the shirt presented a choking hazard, and let's face it, Red Sox fans  know all about choking.  A choking hazard.  Very funny.  Major League spokesperson said they objected to the message on the t-shirt. 
[01:24:30]  Some fans felt it went a little too far, and they were uncomfortable with it.  Why?  See, that's the...  No, they were uncomfortable.  I can kind of understand.  We have gotten so PC.  So PC.  Why can't you wear a shirt that says, who's your daddy, as a little ribbing to the Red Sox?  Who's your daddy?  That's...  Why?  Because some people are upset by this? 
[01:25:00]  Offended?  Uncomfortable?  No, everyone's got to be made comfortable now.  At the expense of any humor or a good time.  Well, and it does go a little too far.  What we've come to.  It goes a little far.  Does it?  Yeah, you know, because that's what should make you uncomfortable when you're a Red Sox fan.  Not almost a hundred years of horrendous business decisions.  Not watching Clemens and Wade Boggs win championships in New York. 
[01:25:30]  That shouldn't bother you.  It should be this shirt.  It should be a t-shirt.  How about, hey, Sox fans, your mother's a twat.  Something like that.  Maybe they'll accept that.  Well, there were some stories when we were on the radio a while ago where they were kicking  people out of the stands that had these offensive t-shirts.  You're not even allowed to go to the game with some of these offensive t-shirts.  They kick you right out.  You've got to keep it kind of fun, though.  You know, because in corporate America, everybody's humor.  How about something good-natured, like, hey, Boston, hope you're swinging, miss. 
[01:26:00]  Hey, batter, batter.  And then on the back, swing batter.  And you can turn around right when you want them to swing because you can't yell it out  because that might upset people.  Yeah, I don't want to disturb someone enjoying the game.  Bring in the whole family there.  So they talked to some Yankee fans in this article.  It's pretty funny.  This lady said, it's so funny.  The Red Sox are mean enough about the Yankees, so it's ridiculous to get bent out of shape  about a t-shirt based on something their own players said. 
[01:26:30]  Let's not forget, Pedro Martinez said this, okay?  But could that ass of a woman have been more obvious in her statement to the paper?  Jesus, she said everything that we're all knowing already.  Just put some kind of twist on it, lady.  That's the paper.  These reporters don't do crap.  But the lady interviewed.  Come on, why are they so bent out of shape?  Oh, I didn't think of that.  I'm sure the guy interviewed a million people, and that was the best quote he thought for his little article.  And then, it's not funny, corrected hotel worker Scott of the Bronx.  It's hilarious.  Oh.  I didn't see where it was going there. 
[01:27:00]  It took me for a loop.  They're just a bunch of crybabies up there in Boston.  Mm-hmm.  So, you can't get the Hey Red Sox, Who's Your Daddy t-shirt anymore.  You didn't read the end.  This is the best part.  Where?  What?  What?  What?  What happened?  By late afternoon, the site, the Boston Globe, was trying to get some Boston fans to have rebuttal shirts.  And some of the suggestions they've got are, send the evil empire straight to hell.  Oof.  Hey, Yankees, how about some chin music and, hey, Yankees, the milkman's your daddy, exclamation point. 
[01:27:30]  Wow, the Boston fans have some cutting humor.  Who's your daddy?  I don't know, because he shot his wife in the stomach and then blamed it on a Negro.  How's that for a t-shirt?  Or how about, hey, Boston, where's the other half of your nanny? 
[01:28:00]  I like that one.  That only comes in baby tees, though.  There's not enough room for a real t-shirt.  Let me see here.  What about the Where's Whitey shirts?  They had those for a while.  Yeah, you know, Chris from Boston says, hey, boys, I hate Red Sox fans.  I'm from here.  There are t-shirts that say, Jeter sucks A-Rod all over the place.  I've seen those.  They're funny shirts.  They're great shirts.  That is funny.  Jeter, yeah.  I laughed my ass off. 
[01:28:30]  We just did a gig in Boston, and you see the Boston fans walking around with these t-shirts.  I'm not getting all pissed off.  I think it's hilarious.  Jeter sucks, or Clemens sucks, Jeter swallows.  Who cares?  That doesn't bother me.  As long as they're winning.  Yeah, it makes you like Jeter more.  He's a team player.  Let's go to the phones.  How about, I was raped on the Kennedy compound lawn.  You got a little blue dot on it like they showed in the trial.  Something fun like that.  Sure, why not?  Let's go to Yonkers. 
[01:29:00]  Artie, what's up?  Yeah, I went to a Boston game.  I had a Yankee shirt on.  People were throwing beer on me every time I turned around.  And then when the security came, it was a black guy.  They go, oh, great.  Here comes the nigger.  Oh, man.  Animals.  They're animals.  Jesus.  But they suck, so whatever.  Well, everyone knows that the racial tension up there in Boston is pretty hot and heavy.  It's the most segregated city I've ever seen.  I was going to say, it's not that hot up there because they segregate everyone.  They keep everyone in their own areas.  The Italians got their area. 
[01:29:30]  The Irish have theirs.  The blacks have theirs.  And that's pretty much the only three people they allow in Boston.  And then you got the Snooties in Newton.  Yeah.  But the Jews are in Newton, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah, another great idea for a shirt.  Hey, Red Sox fans, where's John John?  Oh, wow.  Hey, Sean, what's up?  That's your cue.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  First, I must say, Yankees suck.  Okay. 
[01:30:00]  Of course.  Being a big-time Red Sox fan myself, knowing Yankees suck, this T-shirt is actually very funny.  I don't know what anyone's complaining about.  Especially since he said it.  Yeah.  Come on.  It's hilarious.  I think it's funny.  Obviously, he didn't say it right after he got out of a shower.  That's for sure.  Filthiest team in baseball.  The Red Sox.  God, are they a greasy-looking team.  Awful.  If Peter didn't say it himself, he would think, what the hell is going on?  But, I mean, come on.  He said it himself. 
[01:30:30]  He thinks that his daddy.  What's wrong with that?  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  Who's the guy with the Tarzan hairdo on the side?  Nick Damon.  Johnny Damon.  And then who's the black guy with the honest Abe Lincoln beard?  David Ortiz.  David Ortiz, yeah.  He kills the Yankees.  That's the Red Sox that scares me more than anything.  I don't like him at all.  He is the Yankee killer.  I don't like him at all.  He really, really makes me nervous.  The big lefty.  You guys are in trouble because Curt Schilling is on the team this year.  Paul, what's going on?  Oh, don't worry about it.  Love you, Jimmy. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, hi, Paul.  I love you.  Thank you, sir.  I just want to say, instead of a Yankees suck shirt, how about a Yankees aren't that  good shirt?  Or maybe Yankees kind of stink shirt.  How about Yankees need to improve next year shirt?  You're right.  That's a little less judgmental.  Family values.  Family values.  That's right.  But being from Boston, man, this shocks me that we're being such whiny jizz bags about  this whole thing.  That is very whiny.  It makes you guys look really, really faggy.  Yeah, I'm trying to defend you guys. 
[01:31:30]  I mean, we lived up there for a while.  I don't think it's the hardcore Sox fans.  You're probably right.  They could, you know, I think they could take it.  Yeah, they can.  They probably understand.  They dish it out well, and I think they could take it.  I think this is coming from another, you know, part of the Red Sox nation there.  Some corporate playoff, like, you know, faggot businessman who goes to a couple of  games a year, right?  Like, that's it.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, that's weird.  I don't know why anyone's complaining.  All right, Paul, thank you.  But Boston fans are usually not that whiny about it.  They usually just take their losses and, you know.  Let's take one more from Boston here.  Dave, hey, what's up? 
[01:32:00]  Hey, I got to tell you guys, it's not just the Major League Baseball fans.  I was at the Patriots-Buffalo game, and we had Bill's Suck t-shirts on, and the  Bills fans went ballistic, and security made us take the damn things off.  Well, you're just speaking the truth there.  The Bills do suck.  Well, that's what I thought, too.  But it's not just those fans, and I got to agree with Opie.  I think it's those fringe corporate assholes, and not the real fans.  It's really revolting that these sissies have infiltrated. 
[01:32:30]  I mean, not only are they teaching fat men that you can spend 25 grand and dress like  this European bisexual and think you look good with tan, tight-fitting slacks.  Get the post, page 41.  This guy's an absolute ass.  But, you know, can't have any judgments in life anymore.  Well, that's the problem.  Unless it's a positive judgment, you can't have it.  There's no negative judgments allowed.  You know, leave the baseball to the hardcore fans.  If you're there with your family, and you're getting your little flags to wave around and 
[01:33:00]  stuff, the game's not for you anymore.  No.  How about, hey, Red Sox fans?  I hope Ted Kennedy drives Curt Schilling home over the Chappaquiddick Bridge.  A little long, but, yeah, I think it's appropriate.  You can use both sides of the shirt.  Sure.  Both sides.  A little splash graphic on there.  A little, like, hand clutching a baseball under the water with Glove Glove.  I don't know.  It's off the top of my head.  I'm working.  Why not?  Yeah, why not?  Anthony, what's up? 
[01:33:30]  Not too much, Opie.  How are you?  Oh, a caller.  Jeez.  New York checking in.  What's up, Ant?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, I got a nice shirt for Boston.  Yeah.  How about the, I draw my secretary into a pond and left it there.  Ah, yes.  The old Ted Kennedy Chappaquiddick gag.  I'm getting, like, a deja vu thing all of a sudden.  It's a little strange.  Oh, how about something a little less offensive, like, hey, Smith kids, who's your mommy? 
[01:34:00]  Wow.  There's no, like, Boston connection there.  Who's your mommy?  Well, who's your daddy?  Who's your mommy?  Yeah, exactly.  I got it.  Hey, little Yates fellas.  All five of you.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Five little coffins.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, Gordon?  What's up, Gordon?  You are wrong.  Oh, that is so bad.  That's even wrong on Saturday radio.  Five little coffins all in a row.  Hey, Mark, what's up?  Smelling of pine.  You know, Johnny Damon, he looks like the guy that fucking mows my lawn. 
[01:34:30]  He's just one of those guys that stands out in Farmingdale on the corner, like, waiting  to get picked up.  He's riding home on the big pile of grass clippings in the back of the pickup truck.  Yeah, exactly.  He's a Cro-Magnum, man.  And then with that beard and hair, he likes to think he's Jesus, the savior of Beantown.  We're going to win the championship, finally.  F.  Johnny Damon, and the Sox, because they suck.  There you go.  I just want to see the disappointment again.  That's okay.  I yearn to see Boston disappointment. 
[01:35:00]  I wouldn't even mind it as much if they weren't so cocky, right?  But every year, they're like, this is our year.  Oh, yeah, I know.  They sound like they've won the World Series hundreds of times.  Schilling's pitching tonight, right?  Yeah, he's good.  But the Yankees buy championships.  Pedro, Schilling, Manny.  Those guys are all doing it for free and for the love of the game.  Yeah, all right.  A-Rod, Jeter.  You spend a lot of...  Well, hey, look.  Boston went after A-Rod.  They dangled Garcia Parra.  They embarrassed who was, at one point, their franchise player, and they just couldn't  get him. 
[01:35:30]  I'm not saying you can't spend money, but people cry when the Yankees spend money.  That's what you should do.  Garcia Parra was the curse, though.  They got rid of him.  Yeah, look.  Look what happened.  They're better without A-Rod.  No, no, no.  But what I'm saying is, they tried to get A-Rod.  No, ma.  No, ma.  That's Ramon backwards.  Hey, yes, it is.  Hey, hey, hey.  But they tried to get A-Rod.  So Boston tried to get him.  The Mets are too cheap to get him, and the Yankees got him.  You know what's funny?  When they traded No, Mar, rosy-cheek Bob Lobel cut into the sport.  He cut in on, like, programming.  You know, half the back.  Like it was a big special report. 
[01:36:00]  No, Mar's been traded, you know?  The old Bob Lobel.  He did do terribly last year in the postseason.  No, Mar.  That was good for a comedy show to throw that in.  All right, we should step aside here.  In honor of the Hey, Red Sox, Who's Your Daddy t-shirt that you're not allowed to wear  anymore.  What George Carlin bit do you have queued up?  It's the Who's Your Daddy thing we played yesterday.  Ooh.  We'll send this out to the Sox fans.  Oh, my God.  It feels so good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Play with my boys.  Play with my boys.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah, just roll them around.  It feels so good.  Oh, my God.  I love it when you...  Uh-oh.  Slow down.  Uh-oh.  Ah-ah.  Don't move.  I'll go get you a towel. 
[01:37:00]  I think it's two chimps on a Davenport and a basement.  You guys are a hip cat crowd, man.  I needed you guys.  I don't always get hip crowds.  I know you're thinking, no way.  Butch, L.A., New York, Ontario.  Come on.  Not always, man.  I get sent to some weird, weird places.  Like, yeah, check this out.  Here's a good example.  Two months ago, now I'm not sure if anybody's going to be familiar with this place, but two  months ago, I, Butch Lord, played Branson, Missouri. 
[01:37:30]  Now, if you're laughing, you know what Branson is.  Those rest...  Look, you see the youngsters are looking at me like, Branson, blink, blink, what the hell?  Check it out.  Let me hip you, man.  Branson is a little town in Missouri where a whole bunch of old-time country singers open  their own theaters, right?  They got, like, the Andy Williams Theater, the Roy Clark Theater.  It's like Lollapalooza for senior citizens.  It's a senior Oz fest.  I'm not kidding, man.  They put me in a room with 400 senior citizens. 
[01:38:00]  I scared the shit out of those people.  They were staring at me like I was touching their granddaughters or something, you know?  And it wasn't their fault they treat the old people.  They just put a sign up on a sign that said, Comedy Tonight.  So 400 old people go staggering in there, expecting to see Milton Berle.  And they get Charles Manson, pretty much.  It's good for them, though.  They ain't got much exercise in years, just trying to run the hell out of there.  That guy said, fuck!  I'm not kidding you. 
[01:38:30]  I cleared the Boxcar Willie Theater in record time.  I'm serious.  Two fucks and a pussy, place was empty.  That was it.  That was, uh...  There was no one left.  Just an old couple down front with broken hearing aids.  Something about, I like him.  He's a cat lover.  That one kinds of takes your second, doesn't it, bro? 
[01:39:00]  See you doing the math.  Carry the two.  Oh, pussy jump.  Okay.  All right.  Another hit for The Sims.  I'm Ed Donoghue with the Home Entertainment Update.  In its first ten days on the market, the video game Sims 2 sold more than a million copies.  That's the biggest launch ever for an electronic arts game.  Sims 2 lets you control the lives of virtual humans.  Lucy Bradshaw is executive producer.  You really are engaged in satisfying your Sim's lifetime goals, as opposed to really focused on strictly their basic needs. 
[01:39:30]  Being able to construct your Sim with so much detail and so much variety possible, and then play them through their entire lifetime, I think, really just takes on an entirely different way that you're engaging with them.  Since this is a sequel, there is some new stuff in Sims 2.  We've added a new feature called the Movie Maker, where you can record any of your gameplay, and then using any movie editing software, you can actually put it together and make your own Sim's home movie. 
[01:40:00]  We're already seeing some of the fans putting together their own movies, and they're pretty interesting.  Sims 2 from Electronic Arts is rated T for teens.  I'm Ed Donoghue.  Spirit is invisible.  It is soundless.  Liquid metal can make you deaf, and your ears might bleed.  It is without texture, without taste, without smell.  It is dimensionless, spaceless, and timeless.  Channel 42!

Moments after the Jimi Hendrix Experience reduced the stage to ashes at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967,  it was clear Jimi's incendiary guitar playing had finally converted the American audience to his electric vision.

[01:41:30]  Here, check it out, the mass call of the Opie and Anthony Show, better known as the ONA virus spreading across America.  Ah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  On channel 202.  It's called high voltage, but we're going to change that too, because high voltage, I don't even know what that means.  No one does.  Shocking.  Yeah, I think they wanted to go with the whole shocking angle, but we don't like being referred to as shock jock, so that doesn't really work. 
[01:42:00]  I want to call the channel the virus.  I like schlock jock.  ONA's virus.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, the virus.  Whatever.  We'll figure it out.  Call name recognition, Opie.  But a big hi to everyone that turned on their XM satellite radios overnight.  You're helping us spread the virus.  If you like what you're hearing in between the bitching, tell a friend.  It'll help us down the road, right?  Opie, also speaking of shock jocks, I'll give a little plug.  Make sure you tune in to a Law & Order Special Victims Unit tonight. 
[01:42:30]  It's an all new episode tonight at 10 p.m.  Lewis Black, our pal Lewis Black, will be starring in the episode as a shock jock.  Oh, that's funny.  That is really funny.  When are we going to get Lewis in here?  It's been a while.  Now rub the phone on your genital.  Yeah, someone was saying that in the email.  We haven't played What's My Pants in a while.  Yes.  I think we'll get one of those in today.  Should I jump in a request?  Just a question?  Yeah, yeah.  I just wanted to ask the media, could you please have a little more coverage of Christopher 
[01:43:00]  Reeve's death?  I'm not quite sure what happened yet.  We did it!  He's dead!  It's sad.  God bless him.  But stop with the Superman.  He really was Superman.  I know.  No, he wasn't.  Superman, not only could this guy not leave over buildings, but he couldn't beat bed sores.  Oh, Jesus.  It is very sad.  They like to pull at the heartstrings there, you know?  They are milking the hell out of this story.  Look, if you've been trying to get me to puke, it happened. 
[01:43:30]  All right?  I've puked, okay?  You can move on to another story.  We get it.  Hey, why didn't I get any attention, huh?  Yeah, Ronnie didn't get half the attention.  Toward the end of his life, he looked like Nosferatu, that bald head propped up in a  chair.  It is very sad that he died, but enough.  He really was Superman.  Well, speaking of which, are you playing off the cartoon that's in the post today?  Oh, that thing.  That was one I saw, and I also, you know, with the front page of the paper with him in  a cape?  How embarrassing.  I know all the news. 
[01:44:00]  That's all they're saying is what a real-life Superman he was.  Show him making out with Michael Caine in Death Trap.  That'd be pretty hot.  At least I could whack my bag in the middle of the sadness.  Two men kissing.  What I don't get is that the news keeps saying, you know, he was so brave.  Did the guy have a freaking choice?  I know.  What was he going to do?  It really is sad, but come on, let's put this in some realistic perspective here.  The guy got paralyzed, and that was now his life.  That's it.  And it sucked.  And he thought about suicide, but his selfish family wouldn't allow him to die. 
[01:44:30]  How could he do it?  If I was his son, I would have taken the wheelchair at the top of the stairs like that classic movie  and let him go.  Oh, kiss of death, Richard Woodmark.  Oh, kiss of death.  Thank you.  He wraps her up in electrical cord.  You lying old hag.  And he wraps her up, and he pushes her down the steps while he's giggling.  It's the greatest scene ever shot.  Yeah, that is really good.  Oh, Pietro's not here.  You lying old hag.  And he snatches electrical cord and wraps her up.  Hey, on the other TV, they got the chick that was found eight days after the car accident. 
[01:45:00]  There's another story in the papers today.  Wait, they don't have her on the show, do they?  She's in a hospital.  I think she's still in a hospital.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, there goes.  No food, no water for eight days.  All right, there goes my joke because the-  Not a single luxury.  We don't have the audio.  Like Robinson Caruso.  That must be a friend then because the joke was, obviously, she had some like Twinkies or something  in the glove compartment.  It was nothing.  The sister's a real fat cell, apparently.  Oh, that was the sister?  All right.  Well, the cartoon in the post, it shows Christopher Reeve's tombstone and the year, obviously, 
[01:45:30]  52 to 2004.  And then you got Batman and you got Spider-Man and Captain America all looking at the grave  and the tombstone and they're all crying.  And they're weeping.  And it says, he really was a Superman.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I swear, they are acting like he was flying around, fighting crime.  That's right.  And going to the Fortress of Solitude at the North Pole and doing everything Superman does. 
[01:46:00]  Ah, there you go.  Well, this would have been nice yesterday.  You know what the worst part of this whole thing is?  That they had to put Margot Kidder on television.  Oof.  She looked bad.  She looked bad.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  Really, really bad.  What bush did they find her in?  I know.  What neighborhood did they find her in wandering around?  She had that wacky Anne Heche breakdown where she just ended up in someone's yard under  the stairs saying people were chasing her. 
[01:46:30]  Did they give her a GPS system so they could find her?  Help me.  General Zod is chasing me.  Kneel before Zod.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, and they had to show her something went on.  You know, you watch the original Superman movie.  There was something wacky going on with her mouth back then.  I don't know what it is.  It was something a little wacky.  It was, I think, considered a little quirky back then.  Now it's just bizarre.  There is something going on where she's got this duck bill thing going on with these lip 
[01:47:00]  wrinkles that go right into her nostrils.  It was very freakish, very freakish, and I'm sorry that he had to die because now we have  to look at her talking about a movie that came out, what, 30 years ago?  Ken from Jersey, really fast.  Christopher Reeve died Sunday.  His career committed suicide with Superman 4.  Wow.  Yeah, that was those last few Superman.  The first one was good.  Superman 2 was okay. 
[01:47:30]  2 was all right, yeah.  Then 3, just goodbye.  Although, I'll tell you, when Margot Kidder lost her mind, I'm sure after she banged Pryor  on screen in Some Kind of Hero, I think that's what really, uh...  Did she?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't even remember that.  That was, like, early 80s.  I think you were the only person that saw that movie.  No, it was actually a good movie.  I don't remember it for many years.  I don't even remember that title ever.  Yeah, Richard Pryor's one of his favorites.  Ken again from Jersey.  Look at him being an overachiever today on the feedback.  He writes, Red Sox are to World Series victories as the Kennedys, Duck Bullets, Successful Search Parties, and Ski Slope Touchdowns. 
[01:48:00]  Wow.  Ski Slope Touchdowns.  Now let's go on to California.  Oh, God.  Put that on a t-shirt.  Yeah.  Never made it out of that kitchen alive.  Two shots and he's not alive.  Jesus.  This is a very angry show today.  Yeah, it really is.  Hey, let's talk about the dead man that keeps paying bills. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, this is great.  I'm not used to having all this show prep.  I've got to go through this whole pile of stuff.  This is an amazing example of technology.  Electronic banking can have its downside.  You do the electronic banking, right, Anthony?  Of course.  It's the only way to go.  I haven't written a check for a bill in years.  It's great.  You've got your bank account.  You pop it up on your computer.  You have your balance.  You've got your bills that you've got to pay. 
[01:49:00]  You just click on them, type in the amount, and boom, you're done.  There's no writing checks.  And then if you have direct deposit, the money goes right into your bank account, and you  can set up the recurring payments where it just comes out every month.  So now you don't even have to go to your computer.  So it seems this is what this guy in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was doing.  Yeah, he died nearly two years ago, but thanks to automatic bill payments, no one noticed.  Now, this isn't a story where he died, was buried, and they kept deducting out of his 
[01:49:30]  bank account for bills.  He was in his house dead.  Dead.  For two years.  For two years.  How can that happen, for God's sake?  Two years, explains Sam, one of his neighbors.  Nice neighbor.  No kidding.  Why don't you knock on the door every once in a while?  Didn't you notice the smell?  Two years.  Well, they didn't notice because he had pre-programmed all of his music that was going on the channel.  And when he didn't show up for two years, people were like, well, something's a little 
[01:50:00]  different, and they didn't figure out what it was until they saw a pile of beard hairs.  Well, the replay of George Carlin bits should have gave it away.  I used to ask the president of the condominium board of directors, where in the hell is he?  This is the neighbor again.  She said all she knew was the bank gets the monthly money, so we don't worry about it.  Yeah, he was paying his rent, so they didn't bang on the door or anything.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  He was mummified.  His mummified corpse bore no sign of trauma, so exact cause of death could not be determined. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, so he just rotted in his apartment?  He sat there rotting as his bills were being paid.  Yeah, a cousin says in this article, they knocked on his door and he didn't answer.  You assume he isn't home.  You certainly don't assume he's dead.  Well, wow.  Maybe the first couple of times.  Yeah.  When you see he's been on the couch in the same position for more than six months, you  might want to call the paramedics. 
[01:51:00]  Some relatives had gone by his apartment last summer.  Or, didn't they, like this is just a combination of things.  It's the automated banking and all, but it's also a very negligent family.  The guy was probably a scumbag and they were like, yeah, we got to drop it.  Nah, he's not home.  Screw it.  You know how they figured out how long he was dead?  This is creepy.  Sulker's body was finally discovered on August 25th.  A newspaper in the apartment was dated November 21st, 2002, and a calendar on the wall was 
[01:51:30]  open to the same month.  Ugh.  Mummified.  Wow.  Well, he probably got to read about our firing.  November 21st?  All right.  August?  A little before that?  And finally, it's odd that we live in a society where technology can take care of our affairs  like that, even if we passed away two years ago and nobody's noticed.  It's true.  So, like I said, I do the banking, and you know something?  I don't check anything either. 
[01:52:00]  I don't check.  They take the money out.  Money goes in.  I have no clue.  Easy pass?  You think I look at my easy pass thing to see if I've been through these tolls?  They could chalk up unbelievable amounts of money and just pocket it, and I won't think  twice about it.  I don't go through there thinking, I don't remember going through that tunnel.  Eh.  There's a scam, too, going on in New York garages.  They take your easy pass.  The guys in the garage, it was happening in my garage.  They're taking your easy pass.  Really?  And what do they do?  They use it?  They use it, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  And then put it back?  Yeah.  There's a whole scam going on in my garage.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  Who would figure garage workers in New York City would be...  Dishonest.  Dishonest like that.  Not Jamaican Mike.  He wouldn't do that.  No, he's my garage guy.  Jamaican Mike with the huge schlong man.  When is he going to make his first appearance on the new Opie and Anthony show?  End of the week.  End of the week.  End of the week.  He wants to come in.  Oh, cool.  He's giving rave reviews of the program.  He loved the Drill Doe segment. 
[01:53:00]  Who didn't love the Drill Doe?  I know.  We should just play that for four hours a day.  We'll be heroes.  Jamaican Mike's got those horror stories of down in Jamaica, how the girlfriends get together.  When your girlfriend decides her and another girlfriend are going to go down to Jamaica  on a little vacation, Jamaican Mike will fill you in on what goes on.  These huge Jamaican guys take your girlfriend and stretch them out so badly that you've got  to rub it on the side for any friction when she gets home. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, man.  Fill her up, Jamaican.  Yeah.  He's hung like a four-by-four.  Smooth talker.  And the girls don't care.  They figure they're out of the country, you know.  There's that whole rule that it doesn't matter if you're out of the country.  And these guys are walking down the beach, you know.  Can I make you a coconut drink?  They make the drink.  They get you all snotted. 
[01:54:00]  And before you know it, their tops are coming off their bottoms.  They're in the nice, warm, blue waters.  He's getting hammered by a Jamaican water snake.  Never.  Jamaican Mike will fill you in on that.  He'll be in the end of the week.  Limping, humming three little birds.  This guy's calling from Illinois.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, you're talking about the guy who was dead in his apartment for a couple of years.  This happened over in Germany.  The guy was dead for five years, though.  Five years dead? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, five years dead in his apartment.  The only way they found him was that the mailman became suspicious that his Christmas decoration lights were on in the middle of July.  Yeah, how does a mailman not know?  Yeah, with the first four Julys, it didn't bother him.  But the fifth one, he's like, wait a minute, this is odd.  Wait, I think there's something here.  Yeah, total modification there.  Something that doesn't seem quite right.  What kind of a non-impact have you had in the world when you can be dead for two years?  And I mean, look, we could all be dead for a few weeks and people assume we went away. 
[01:55:00]  Right.  Two years and nobody's like, where is he?  I have to know where he is.  You are making zero contribution.  Right.  On Earth.  None contribution.  All right, another crazy story as we move on here.  We've got some very, very hot-looking women that have showed up here today.  I haven't seen them yet.  All you guys get up and ran outside to take a look at them.  Oh, they're beautiful.  They smell great.  But I guarantee they're going to be radio kryptonite. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, that's usually the case.  Because they're here for a reason.  They have something to plug.  The Swedish girls are gaming.  They're in the magazine with you guys.  Oh, yeah, we're in the latest issue of SYNC Magazine.  Our name is even on the cover.  It's spelled different.  It's not like a plumbing supply magazine, you know.  It's a SYNC Magazine.  It's faucets and...  Meet the Kohler, boys.  It's S-Y-N-C, the latest issue.  And we're on the back page. 
[01:56:00]  And I really don't even know what the purpose of this was.  Yeah, I have no idea what the purpose of this was.  We're playing with remote-controlled, radio-controlled cars.  Yeah.  Hopefully, it was to make you guys both look a little gay.  Because it's working?  Yeah.  It's a little strange.  We're playing with radio-controlled cars.  I like radio-controlled stuff.  There's a lot of tech in this magazine, right?  Yeah.  And they interviewed us for an hour.  I remember the photo shoot.  I remember we had a makeup artist, and we had a buffet of all sorts of fine food we could eat. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  And a guy was there with a tape recorder talking to us.  Yeah.  But?  I don't know what this...  No quotes or anything?  Well, it's two paragraphs, so let me read it really fast.  And then you can pick it up for yourself and check out the lovely picture of your pal's O&A.  Drive-time DJs.  Get it?  Because we're driving the remote-controlled cars.  Oh!  That's what it meant.  Exiled shock jocks.  Open Anthony celebrate their return to airwaves by road-testing radio-controlled race cars. 
[01:57:00]  Wait.  We were celebrating our return to the air by playing with radio-controlled cars?  Wow.  That's a stretch.  I was celebrating my return by banging.  Had nothing to do with radio-controlled race cars.  You guys really didn't have a party.  We're back on the air.  Quick.  Get the batteries.  Right.  Where's my old Atari games?  I'm back.  Better than ever.  Lay on your stomach and open up.  I'm going to drive this right into your colon. 
[01:57:30]  We're out of control.  Break out all the PlayStation games.  We're wild.  Oof.  All right.  It starts really fast.  I'm such a retard with this stuff, says Greg Opie Hughes.  Greg Opie Hughes.  The pumpkin-headed half.  Pumpkin-headed?  Uh-huh.  What the hell is that?  That means I have a big head.  That means big head, not red hair or what.  Well, they call it strawberry blonde, Anthony.  I don't understand pumpkin head.  The pumpkin-headed half. 
[01:58:00]  My head is proportional to Anthony's head in this picture.  They're not calling you the pumpkin-headed.  What am I?  I got brown hair.  The dog-crap-headed Anthony?  No, they don't use an adjective for you.  That's what pisses me off.  Does your head look big in that photo?  Does it?  A little.  Does it really?  I don't know if it's like a pumpkin.  Maybe like an oblong squash.  It's not round like a pumpkin.  I'm leaning forward, though.  You look good.  Band it on your foot, bigger than your head.  The pumpkin-headed half of XM Satellite Radio's The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:58:30]  Unable to master the controls to SYNC's tricked-out XMOD custom RC race cars.  Go to xmods.com for more.  Hughes kicks over a bottle of blood in mock frustration while his goateed partner...  Oh, okay.  Oh, it was the goateed partner.  His goateed partner, Anthony Cumia, guides a Toyota Supra around a turn effortlessly.  No, you were having problems with these stupid things, too.  I got it down in about five minutes, especially once we took him off the track and started raising 
[01:59:00]  him up the walls.  And then it says, two years ago, they caught hell.  Here it comes, the slug line that's in every fucking article out there.  Caught hell.  Two years ago, they caught hell for broadcasting a couple having sex in New York City's St.  Patrick's Cathedral and were booted from the air as a result.  Fortunately, a new home on satellite radio means no censors, so they can be as nasty  as they want to be.  How many of you spelled W-A-N-N-A?  They certainly did, Jimmy.  Not want to.  W-A-N-N-A. 
[01:59:30]  W-A-N-N-A.  And here's Anthony's only quote.  But we both got only one quote in this one.  I got a quote?  Uh-oh.  We're going to have women call in and rub themselves with the phones.  Yeah, that's it.  Boast Anthony.  That's the whole show.  If we guess from the sound whether she has a strip or the triangle, she'll win something  big.  What?  And then it ends with, don't like it, don't listen.  You know something?  I love Sync Magazine, and I really do.  It's cool.  A lot of tech stuff in there.  But that is the worst interview thing I've ever read. 
[02:00:00]  Ever.  Even Time Magazine I liked better when it said that it was hot for the Olsen twins when  they were about 16.  What are you going to win that's big?  I don't remember giving away any big prizes on this program.  No, I never said that.  I don't think you did.  I never said that.  I don't think we really give away prizes ever.  I've never seen anything.  We don't have prizes.  Hey, Gary, what's up?  Gary, you're cute.  Go.  Yeah, hey, the pumpkin-headed thing.  That's when you went on that little gay joint up on the island there with your girlfriend. 
[02:00:30]  You've got your head taken.  It's a picture in it.  Hey, Opie, are you going to be doing that anymore?  The pumpkin picking?  Pumpkin picking?  Yeah.  That was purely a girlfriend thing that you had to do, right?  Yeah.  Okay, I understand that.  But that's why they're calling you a pumpkin head, probably.  All right.  You don't see many single guys going pumpkin picking.  You don't see many guys in relationships doing it either.  You don't see many guys doing it.  Yeah, that stinks.  Now, you had to go out to Long Island and go way out east and go pumpkin picking for Halloween. 
[02:01:00]  Like I'm the only one that does stupid things in a relationship.  You're not the only one, but, you know.  It's going to lead to one of our stories here, actually.  I know.  And I have a very embarrassing moment in a relationship when I was a very, very young boy.  You know what?  Why don't we step aside?  Are you teasing?  You said no teases in satellite radio.  I want to know who the relationship was with a counselor.  Yes.  No, it's not.  It's no teasing.  It's just that.  A back rub in the guidance counselor's office. 
[02:01:30]  We're ready to play another George Carlin bit, I think.  Oh, no.  No.  Don't even joke.  So, anyway, what we were going to say, these girls are hot.  They smell great, but it's going to be radio kryptonite.  I know what's going to happen.  We're going to bring them in.  We're going to try to get something going on.  And they're like, well, what do you want us to do?  Talk about how hot they are.  What do you want us to do?  Yeah.  What do they do?  They play video games.  They play games.  Oh, that always works on the radio.  Now, what type of games?  I don't know.  We can ask them.  I don't know.  All right.  I'm here for the digital life. 
[02:02:00]  I'm into gaming.  Perhaps I can share some gaming talk with the girls.  Also, Frenchy is here.  And you know how big his head's got.  So, we have him out getting the full search outside.  I hear Frenchy was so pissed off that he came in last week.  Yeah.  And we never put him on the air.  And he was livid.  Like, it was like we had a major motion picture star come in and blew him off.  His head's out of control.  He's getting an attitude.  Even better, he's bringing his girlfriend, right?  So, he sends me a text message that says, okay, cool. 
[02:02:30]  After I responded saying she could come.  I will bring her.  And please do not go off on her.  Don't let the guys give her any shit.  She's very cool.  You will see later.  Like, are you just setting yourself up?  Like, you're setting ground rules.  I wouldn't trash his girlfriend anyway.  No.  You trash him.  Yeah, the fact that she's capable of banging him, you have to admire her fortitude.  Admire the girl's stick-to-itiveness.  Even better, though.  Strong-willed.  Just like the other day when he came, Poe's out there just completely fucking with him.  They got him all spread out. 
[02:03:00]  Got him against the wall, frisking him?  Good.  All right.  Well, when we come back, we'll talk to Frenchy and these girls that play video games.  Wait, wait, wait.  Even better?  This is how big his head is.  He just sent me a text message.  Hey, Ben, I'm at the door.  And I'd like to see how long it's going to take for me, for Poe to let me in.  Frenchy.  What an attitude.  What an attitude.  He's not that good.  Come on.  I know.  All he does is say F and S and suck it.  I'm French.  Why don't you go suck it?  Suck it.  I cooked rat for you five years ago. 
[02:03:30]  I'm still living off that bit.  I love the people that are associated with the show that are living off the one bit they did five years ago.  One bit.  You know me.  I'm the rat cooking guy.  Hey, does anybody know what happened?  I know you had said that, was it Paula Pilot was injured?  Does anybody know like what?  Oh, yeah.  Is he all right?  I really don't know what the status is.  Yeah, we've got to get info on that.  Yeah, just remember that.  Yeah, I've got to do a car accident.  There's been a lot of death and destruction associated with this radio show. 
[02:04:00]  One day we've got to do a whole break on that.  Destruction.  Anyway, okay, so, I don't remember.  Oh, the, okay, what people do in relationships, right?  There's a great story on that.  Yeah, because some guy really went out on a limb to try to get his wife back.  Where's that?  Oh, oh, oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  And other things.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Socks first, then shoes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, hello there. 
[02:04:30]  I'm Newton Ames, talking to you on behalf of the Monolithic Oil Corporation  about today's energy situation.  You know, if we all just sacrifice a little,  we can pull together to beat the current problems of not enough energy. 
[02:05:00]  And Monolithic is doing its part by killing most of the birds  that nest around our beautiful oil refineries.  Birds eat up a lot of food.  And as everyone knows, food takes energy to grow and prepare.  So the fewer birds there are, the less energy will be wasted.  Now, how can you help?  Well, if there are any old folks around the house,  just set them outside at night.  This looks like a long, hard winter, 
[02:05:30]  and the fewer people there are, the less energy demand there'll be.  Leaving the old folks outside is nothing new.  The Eskimos do it all the time.  And they know a thing or two about surviving in cold weather without much heat.  You betcha.  When you drive, don't take your foot off the gas for stop signs, red lights, little children, or anything.  A smooth, steady driving technique is the most economical.  The cost in human lives, suffering, and property damage 
[02:06:00]  will be more than offset by the savings in gasoline.  Well, I hope these tips have helped you become more aware  that the blame for today's energy situation  is on your shoulders and your conscience  and not ours.  Monolithic Oil Corporation.  We want you to pay.  The Technophile. 
[02:06:30]  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  Self-service video stores are beginning to pop up nationwide.  You walk into a lobby full of machines,  enter your card, watch a trailer or two,  press a couple of buttons, and a DVD pops out.  Rental fees are about $1 for six hours  and $2.50 for a 24-hour period.  The company is called Movie Bank USA  and is opening facilities in New York, Boston, L.A.,  and other major cities.  Large apartment and office buildings  are also likely candidates  for self-service movie rental machines.  The DVD rental market is going to be drastically changed 
[02:07:00]  as on-demand services appear  from the likes of cable providers  and the folks at TiVo.  Content distributors are salivating  over new portable media centers,  which are essentially iPods for video.  Digital rights management will be key,  but consumers will balk if it's too restrictive  and doesn't allow you to take your movies  and TV shows with you on the road.  For more on portable media centers,  do a search on Google.  I'm LAZLOW.com,  and that's what's on my underground hard drive.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio. 
[02:07:30]  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Opie and Anthony.  I saw them in the hall once.  They looked like they had small packages.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I get me, man.  It's the O-N-A virus. 
[02:08:00]  Tell your friends if you're enjoying what you're hearing.  We've got a lot of goodness right outside the studio.  Goodness?  Is the, um... 
[02:08:30]  Can they enjoy the program from out there?  They can hear us right now?  Do you want them not to enjoy the program?  No, I'm just wondering.  You might want to turn down the audio for a second  so we can set this up.  We can go to the phones really fast while Ben does that.  Someone wants to comment about Ben.  Anthony, what's going on?  What's going on?  No, I just want to congratulate Ben on the perfect impression of Don Corleone's grandson  after they released him from the hospital.  Hey, Grandpa, I hope you get special.  Love, Frank.  From your grandson, Frank.  Frank.  Frank.  Right.  Very good.  From your grandson, Frank. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  Well, Ben turns down the show down there.  Ben's three years old.  He reads the funny papers.  Ah.  He reads the funny papers.  A couple allegedly had sex at the Alamo.  Tours at the...  What, Ben?  You're giggling.  Stop.  You're spilling it.  You're spilling it.  Okay.  Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.  Frenchy's really pissed off, by the way.  Yeah, that's what I'm laughing about.  Okay.  Frenchy just can't believe that he hasn't been, you know, escorted in like he's Mick Jagger.  You know, it's like...  Where is that uncircumcised coward? 
[02:09:30]  He's outside.  Well, Poe's now intentionally screwing with him.  Like, we've got the metal detector going through him.  We've got him all spread out.  Yeah, Master Paul.  I'm a signed assassin.  I drink more than I used to.  Yeah.  It's good for you, Pop.  A couple allegedly had sex at the Alamo.  San Antonio.  Tours at the Alamo saw something besides historical exhibits at the Shrine of Texas Independence.  Mm-hmm.  How long does it take before they throw our name into this story?  A couple who witnesses say we're having sex Sunday at the downtown mission landed in jail. 
[02:10:00]  An Alamo security officer caught the two having sex near a public viewing area about 5.30 p.m.  The report said Christine and Matthew were partially clad.  Oh, my God.  I know what makes this story even better.  What?  That should be in the headline.  A couple allegedly has teen sex at the Alamo.  Whoa!  Oh, teen sex at the Alamo.  Not in the headline.  It should be, though.  Nice.  You want people to read this story, you need to put teen. 
[02:10:30]  Because everything sounds better with the word teen in it.  Teen.  The report said Christine, 18, and Matthew, 19, were partially clad when the officer apprehended  them after several tours watched the couple and became upset.  Of course.  Were they wearing those offensive Red Sox shirts?  Faggot, boring tourists.  Let's look at the massacre site, but don't fuck.  Did they have a spotter?  Did they have a spotter that got them in trouble? 
[02:11:00]  Is someone watching?  We're here at the Alamo, and he's doing the balloon knot.  He's doing the balloon knot.  That's not too distracting, Kevin.  Did they have some garrison-rocking sex?  You know, in the garrison.  Pew-rocking, you mean?  Oh, pew-rocking, yeah.  Should we get the women in here?  Sure.  They'll be great, I'm sure.  Yeah.  These are...  Are they Swedish?  All I can say...  I don't think they're Swedish. 
[02:11:30]  No, they're not.  It said Swedish.  I guess that's a...  I'm going to warn our listeners.  This could turn into be a very boring segment, but we'll give it a shot.  Picture your girlfriend times 10.  Let's bring them in.  Wow-wee.  How many are there?  There's like a dozen really hot girls.  Holy Toledo.  Hey, why don't you guys get in line?  One by one, come up to the mic, say your name and your age.  Thelma Lundin.  What?  What?  Thelma.  Thelma?  Thelma. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, Thelma here in...  Thelma, right, but it's Thelma.  In Sweden, it's Thelma, yeah.  In Sweden, it's Thelma.  Yeah, it is.  She's definitely Swedish.  How old are you?  20.  Damn.  All right, next.  I'm Emily, and I'm 25.  25, very nice.  Are you all Swedish?  No.  No?  Not all?  Well, she obviously is Swedish.  Danish.  Yeah, Sophie, and I'm 18.  There we go.  There we go.  18. 
[02:12:30]  Get some Danish for Belle.  I'm 24.  24, very nice.  I'm 17.  17.  Wow.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  And you're 11.  And I'm Sophie, and I'm 20.  20.  Wow, wait.  Sophie, where are you from?  Sweden.  Sweden, also.  All right.  Can you just repeat after me?  Can you just say, sir, this isn't the way to my house?  You've got to have them cut lines in that Swedish dialect, whatever it is.  Yes.  Yes.  It's an accent, Oop. 
[02:13:00]  What are they speaking?  It's an accent.  What are they speaking in Swedish?  It's a Swedish dialect.  What do they speak in Sweden?  Swedish?  Swedish.  Swedish.  You guys speak Swedish?  Can you say something in Swedish?  Like, hi.  Hi, Ooppa.  No, no, no.  What did you say?  Oompa, Oompa?  You know, this is satellite radio.  Say something dirty.  No.  Who's brave enough to say something dirty in Swedish or whatever?  I don't speak Swedish dirty, so I can't.  You don't speak Swedish dirty.  What do you speak? 
[02:13:30]  Okay, how about something in Dutch?  Yeah, Dutch, whatever.  We don't.  Ratma.  Ratma.  Oh.  What's that mean?  I'm not going to tell you.  Ratma.  She's not telling us.  I'm not going to tell you.  How do you say it?  Ratma.  Ratma.  Does it have something to do about his meaty breasts?  Yeah.  No, it has something to do with him, but not.  Really?  Oh.  Hey, that chin makes me damp.  Holy perverted lump of crap.  All right.  Hey, toilet chest.  And why are the ladies here today? 
[02:14:00]  Apparently, you girls are good at games, huh?  Yeah.  Good at games?  Yeah.  We're very good at games.  Good at games?  They all have their sink t-shirts on.  We probably beat you, so.  Huh?  We probably beat you.  All you girls look, I swear, they're very beautiful.  They look like girls that I download a lot of smut off the internet, and you kind of have  that look, which I like.  I like that look.  What games do you play?  We play Counter-Strike.  Counter-Strike. 
[02:14:30]  Counter-Strike.  Rock.  The best online game ever.  I love Counter-Strike, except for the smack tards on there.  They're the little bastards that cheat.  And that cheat, do you?  No?  We hate cheaters.  Yeah, cheaters suck.  We don't need them.  We need them anyway, so.  But you kick ass?  Really?  Yeah.  You don't look like you'd kick ass.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  All right.  This is going great, Opie.  What?  This is going great.  I know.  You've got one mic. 
[02:15:00]  No, no.  I know.  No, just step up to the mic.  Don't be shy.  There's no organization here.  There's plenty for you girls.  No, no, no, no.  And are you playing in any competitions?  Yeah, well, a couple months ago, we were in France.  All right.  Get right up to that mic.  Don't be shy.  France?  It's a big mic, you know.  I know.  I know it looks like a black one, but don't be shy.  France, huh?  How was that?  It was a...  Did the gamers in France surrender before the game started?  Playing Counter-Strike, I could see the French players going, what? 
[02:15:30]  I can't pick a white flag?  I don't want a weapon.  I want a white flag to surrender.  As you come goose-stepping through their city without firing a shot?  No?  But here's my problem.  If you're doing the online gaming, no one knows how hot you guys are.  That's...  It's all about the hotness when we look at you.  That's sometimes an advantage.  I mean...  What's your name on the game?  Aurora.  Aurora.  Yeah.  I'm playing against Aurora, and she's kicking my ass.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty hot.  I bet everyone thinks you're a guy, though, playing. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Because there's never...  Any guys that are either playing games or trolling the net for something, you see a name like  Aurora, it's a fat guy sitting there spanking it.  Yes, I'm Aurora.  Oh, but Queen.  What are you?  She's Queen.  Queen?  Well, they used to call me Drag Queen, so...  Well, they would think, yeah.  They would think it's a gay guy.  Yeah, yeah.  What are the rest of your names?  What's yours?  I'm Selena.  And I'm just Anna.  Just Anna.  Yeah, so they know...  Couldn't think one up, huh?  What about you?  I'm Vixen. 
[02:16:30]  Vixen.  Vixen.  See, that's another name.  If you see Vixen online, middle-aged, fat guy spanking it quickly because his kids come  home at three.  Well, actually, Vixen is...  Well, we kind of heard this in France.  We didn't know that, but Vixen is like masturbating in German.  It is?  Yeah, the German guys, they told us, so we were like...  Vixen means spanking it in German?  Wait, is it...  No, Vixen's not one of the reindeer, right?  No.  No.  Wow.  All right.  What about the little one there? 
[02:17:00]  What's your name online?  So shy.  Sophie.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sophie.  Sophie.  Someone knows what the sweet girl said.  What?  We'll find out here.  Let's see.  Lowell in Ohio.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Hey, she just said she's making your thing hard.  You're giving me a boner when she said ma hot.  Did she say thing?  Did she really say something that strong, sir?  Oh, yeah.  Is that what you said?  Is that what you said?  It means make hard. 
[02:17:30]  What did I say?  You said you were making him hard?  Uh-huh.  No, that's not it.  No?  Oh, she should have said that.  Nice try.  All right.  So where are you playing now?  You got like something coming up?  An event?  We're planning on going to something called CPL, and that's in...  Where is it this year?  Next year.  Next year in Dallas.  Next year in Dallas.  So you're just kind of hanging out for a year?  So what do you do?  Yeah.  What do you do in the...  Practice.  We have to win it, you know? 
[02:18:00]  What, do you all live in the same house?  No.  Not yet.  No?  But we're thinking about it.  But you guys should be in the same house with a lot of cameras around.  Yeah.  For us to check out on the internet.  Screw this gaming thing.  Voyeur game or something.  Yeah.  Voyeur.  Voyeur gamers dot com.  And you live here in the U.S. or what?  No, this is actually our first time.  This is your first time here?  No, not all of us.  Did a homeless guy hit anyone over the head with a cinder block yet and try to have their  way with you?  You'll love New York. 
[02:18:30]  You know what the best thing is?  All of you should just walk through Central Park at about three in the morning.  It's beautiful.  It really is.  Right.  Yeah.  Check out the stars.  And can anybody whistle?  Are you hiding in the shadows?  No, not me.  You like to do that at three o'clock in the morning?  Not me, but you'll get to look at Captain Obvious.  You have to whistle and yell, Yoo-hoo, Puerto Ricans!  Master Poe, you all right?  Is there a breach in security here or you just want to check out the hot chicks?  Well, I'm making sure that they're okay.  Yeah, they're definitely okay.  Did you frisk them all, hopefully? 
[02:19:00]  No, that's not necessary.  They're okay.  Not necessary.  It's called the perks of the job, bro.  Yeah, that's right.  You ever hear of Justin Volpe?  That wasn't necessary.  They've got to be plugging something.  Yeah, what are you guys plugging?  Are you promoting something?  We've got to get back to our smut show.  Yeah.  Are you promoting stuff?  Yeah, we're promoting Sync.  Sync Magazine.  Sync Magazine.  We're in Sync Magazine this month.  Ooh, so are we.  You showing the picture?  Where are you?  I bet your picture is better than our picture. 
[02:19:30]  Side 96 to 102, I think.  Oh.  Side?  Page.  Side.  Page.  They call it side in...  Wow-wee.  Yeah, you guys...  All right, you've got some very hot pictures in here.  Are they in scantily clad...  No, not really.  I'd just like to say, we didn't really choose what we were wearing.  No, you guys needed...  How it looked, so...  You guys needed the thongs and the jeans that barely go above your...  Oh, nuts.  ...pubic hair.  Yeah, yeah.  You ought to take lessons from the way Paris Hilton dresses. 
[02:20:00]  You like the way she dresses?  No?  No comment.  No?  Wait, no comment?  It's a little bit cold in Sweden, so...  Yeah.  ...just like that.  True, true.  Any boyfriends, husbands, anything?  Boyfriends?  They're in junior high.  Yeah, I stay off.  You have a boyfriend?  I've got two cats.  Two cats?  Yeah.  More importantly, does anybody need a little spending money here in America?  Jimmy's got plenty of cash.  I'll show you around town.  Do you speak Hoboken? 
[02:20:30]  Have you been inoculated?  Any of you guys speak Greek?  What?  Do you speak Greek at all?  Anyone?  No.  No, not at all.  French?  Do you speak French?  No.  Okay.  All right.  Have you been around the world, or are you just coming here first?  I've been around the world.  I've been in L.A. before, too.  Cool.  L.A.  Well, there you go.  Are you guys going to be wrecking any more radio shows while you're in America, or?  Well, that is the plan, yeah.  No.  My goodness, Hopi.  Well, you've been on the air for, what, a week? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, only a week.  Seven days.  I'll give you another week.  I'll shut you down.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Ladies, thank you so much for showing up and promoting Sync Magazine.  Wait, they're going to be at the Digital Life Conference?  Is that the thing we're going to Thursday?  Yeah, I think we're going to that.  Oh, we'll see you Thursday.  Anyway, turn up, and we'll have a day.  Yeah, you have to be there.  I'll play some Counter-Strike.  Yeah, we'll do the Counter-Strike.  You play anything else?  Battlefield 1942?  Yeah.  I love that one.  What's your favorite game out there, besides the Counter-Strike?  Battlefield Vietnam.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Battlefield Vietnam's great.  What do you play on there?  What's your...  My specialty is the chuppers.  You really?  Yeah.  You fly those things?  Yeah.  Because I usually, every time I get on one, it's some asswipe that doesn't know how to  fly it.  I want it plummeting into a lake.  Do they have, like, a mi-lai section there?  Do they have to walk in and just shoot children?  That's great.  Very good.  Might play online.  Definitely got to check it out.  What time is that on Thursday? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, what time?  All day?  Yeah, I think it's all day.  Both Thursday and Friday and Saturday and maybe also Sunday.  I'm not sure.  Could you say something dirty in your language to Jimmy?  My girlfriend, I had a girlfriend, but she broke up with me recently.  I really guess why.  No, no, no.  She didn't.  Oh, oh, oh.  Here we go.  It was simply, it was like a little thing.  She was in the hospital.  Her jaw was healing.  I don't think I want to hear more about that. 
[02:22:30]  You're an awful human.  No, it was nothing.  It was actually an accident.  I didn't, you know, I was just kind of kidding.  I'm like, whack.  All right.  Well, thank you, ladies.  We'll see you Thursday.  Anything else you want to promote?  Anybody have any personal websites?  Sink, sink, sink.  Sink, sink, sink.  Bathtub, bathtub, bathtub.  Toilet, toilet, toilet.  Chest, chest, chest.  Bye, bye, bye.  Thank you, girls.  All right.  Very lovely.  Let's thank you to the really hot girls that we know won't do anything for us. 
[02:23:00]  Very nice.  There they go.  They're great gamers, though.  Hey, you want a Frenchie update?  Frenchie's now calling Master Po names on my text message.  This guy's a fucktop.  I think he's not letting me in.  All right.  Let's get Frenchie in here right now.  Maybe we could save this segment.  I think that was good.  Oof.  It's dark.  Me and Opie know.  We know how those things go.  I'm not even going to try to read.  They're hot chicks that don't really do anything.  That little girl was sexy, though. 
[02:23:30]  Most of them were sexy.  You like the one that looked like she was about 13?  Oh, Jim, let me see your chest, because this is going to be a big one.  It's going to look like a telephone pole.  Frenchie's in the studio.  He's all pissed off because we made him wait.  But you see all the hot girls we had out there?  Yes, they look very nice.  You like that?  Yes, bring him in.  Swedish.  You should have had him talk to the girls.  All right, let's bring him back in.  Really?  Yeah, bring him back in really fast. 
[02:24:00]  Let's see how brave Frenchie is.  Just don't use the C word, man.  No, no, no.  You can't be mean.  Be nice.  I'm always nice.  Girls, this is Frenchie.  He's another big gamer, and he's from France.  Hello, girls.  You play Battlefield Vietnam, right, Frenchie?  Yes, I do.  He plays Battlefield Vietnam, and he can never find the surrender button.  It's the worst part of the game.  Just like the Italians, man.  They suck ass.  I just switch sides in the middle of the game. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, I know, because you're a faggot.  Now, what do you think of the lovely ladies?  They're wonderful.  Aren't they great?  Yes.  Well, thank you.  You're very welcome.  Just like in the war, he's got no balls.  Well, they look very nice.  I'm not going to start going off on them, don't I?  This guy is only brave when he's on the phone.  Only on the phone.  You have nothing to say to the girls?  Well, if you really want me to go off, I can go off.  There's not a reason.  We don't want you to go off. 
[02:25:00]  I mean, with the glasses, you look like Christopher Reeve 20 minutes before he died.  Can you say something?  You still look like a cancer patient, you faggot.  There you go.  Get yourself rolling.  Go ahead.  Ladies, he's all yours.  Oh, you have nothing, Frenchie.  No, I can't.  You're only brave on the phone.  And you have a problem with Master Poe?  Jesus Christ, he's a guy, man.  Get Master Poe in here.  What did you say, Master Poe?  Master Poe.  Master Poe.  He's our assigned assassin.  He was the one that should have frisked all your girls, but decided not to. 
[02:25:30]  He should have, right?  Yeah.  They could be concealing, I think.  Body cavity searches for everyone.  Come on.  Why not?  We got the lube up there by the wiffle ball bat.  Speaking of the wiffle ball bat, ladies, anybody...  Nah, I'm not even going to try.  You see the wiffle ball bat up there in the case?  Yeah.  I want to see their horrified faces when you explain this.  See the marks on it?  You see those little marks?  Yes.  Those marks show where that bat has been, how far it has gone when it has been used. 
[02:26:00]  On you?  On certain...  Not on me.  Well, not in public.  No, there are certain girls that come in here.  They're usually strippers or porn stars.  We like to call them whores.  Or porn stars.  Porn stars?  That try to win the contest, which is to get the mark the furthest up the bat.  And Frenchie was going to ask you a question. 
[02:26:30]  Can you use it?  Can you show us how you use it?  Yeah, you.  No, no, no.  You girls.  Come on.  Wow, man.  Really?  The Swedish are usually not really shy.  Really?  Yeah.  What do you know about the Swedish?  Coming from France, they come by the border all the time.  They do?  Yeah.  And what do they want?  Well, usually they come on a vacation and camping sites, and all they do is screw up all  the time.  Really?  I'm not saying.  I'm not kidding.  It's true. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, man.  No, it's true.  I'm not joking.  What part of France are you from?  Alsace, Lorraine.  Okay.  All right, Frenchie, you had nothing.  Now, you have a problem with Master Poe as well?  No.  Say it to his face.  Oh, my God.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  You know what?  No, because I know Frenchie's going to back down because he doesn't have his little telephone  today.  No.  Ben, why don't you read the text messages that Frenchie had to say about Master Poe?  Why is this guy making me wait so long?  That's what I said.  All right.  Here's that.  I don't think that was it.  This guy's a fucktop.  I'm at the door. 
[02:27:30]  Whoa.  Come and get me.  Frenchie was very upset that he waited, but you don't like Poe.  You already told me you didn't like him.  Why don't you like Master Poe?  Why don't you like Master Poe?  Because he's making me wait 20 minutes outside.  You're a chef, aren't you?  Yeah.  You have knives, don't you?  Yeah.  Next time, bring your knives.  What for?  He's great at knife fighting.  He's an expert at knife fighting.  It's on his resume.  He's great at stick and knife fighting.  Skin you, man.  Oh.  You think so? 
[02:28:00]  With a knife?  Yeah.  He could also fight with sticks.  Oh, okay.  Just in case he's in the woods with no weapon.  He can pick up sticks.  All right.  I make my own sticks.  Frenchie will challenge you to a baguette fight where you both hold big pieces of French  bread and go at each other.  He'd probably be able to kill him with a piece of bread.  All kidding aside, Frenchie, I'm just doing my job.  I know.  I know.  These guys are safe.  Oh, my God.  Opie, I'm going to take this opportunity right now to what they call pull the eject handle. 
[02:28:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Everyone on this side can now leave the studio.  Please.  Thank you, everybody.  Let's hear it for all the showstoppers today.  Frenchie, you can take your headphones off and follow the ladies out of the studio.  Everyone leaves.  Because you're pretty much wearing panties today.  Everyone leaves.  Why doesn't this microphone work?  Now, I want to publicly apologize to our listeners for having to deal with the past 15, 20 minutes 
[02:29:00]  that you will never, ever, ever get back.  Except in replay, which I'm sure you'll be hearing it for the next four days.  Is there a way, perhaps, we can cut this segment out of the show?  Possibly.  It doesn't have to air during replay, or do we have to wait 48 hours?  I think we might be able to jettison that segment.  Because I would really like this just gone.  We could jettison that segment, I think.  At least now we have something to base when we say worst segment ever. 
[02:29:30]  At least we have a litmus test now.  I thought Frenchie was good.  He came in.  He had an accent.  He had a French accent.  That was it.  You know, it's so funny.  Frenchie and Tom, two guys with the biggest egos, have both bond.  And big mouths.  And they don't use them.  There's these hot chicks.  It's like he could have just asked them.  Like, you could have asked if they would use the wiffle ball bat.  But, you know, could I stick it in your A?  Yeah, anything.  Take the embarrassment right now.  They're going to love you for it over the airwaves.  He had nothing.  And the girls, you know, there's a couple of cute ones and all. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, they're beautiful.  But this is radio.  Nothing.  Nothing's going to happen.  No, thank you, sweetie.  We've got to figure out how to get through those segments, like, really fast.  Come in.  Let us sniff you for a little while.  Plug what you've got to and get out.  That's right.  Come in.  Plug.  Beat it.  That's the new motto here.  You know what?  They're, unfortunately, too young to do things, too.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's like, I love when girls want to come in here and do stuff and show us things and  be a little perverted and whatnot.  But they usually have to be older. 
[02:30:30]  No, that's not the case, man.  Yeah?  No, it's not that.  What is it?  It's not that they're too young.  It's that they both, it's that they all still have both parents.  Ah, you think?  Yeah, we've had 20-year-old girls in here that had a messy upbringing that will do whatever  we ask.  You've got to have an uncle with old granddad breath.  That's the girl you need to come in.  Old granddad.  I think maybe the fact that they're not American.  We need divorced teens.  We need teenagers that have parents. 
[02:31:00]  Teenagers from broken homes.  Exactly.  Works more good around the Opie and Anthony show.  You know what would have worked for that segment?  Richard Speck.  Richard Speck in one of Frenchie's kitchen knives would have been really helpful.  While Frenchie...  Yeah, put on nurse outfits, you cockteasers.  Frenchie's stock is dropping.  He's cocky enough to come in here thinking he can still do the same thing to someone's  face.  He just can't.  He has to hide behind his phone.  He's great.  He doesn't have a roll going.  That's why.  He's great when he's on the phone trashing someone, but eye to eye, he's a wimp. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Big time wimp.  I've got good news, though.  We've got a goer coming in tomorrow.  Who, Ben?  Who?  You'll see.  A goer.  A goer.  Who?  Who?  You've got a lady coming in that I think we can maybe get to do the wiffle ball.  All right.  Very good.  Really?  Okay.  We're going to regroup here.  All right.  I was going to play your mom singing.  I was trying to find...  Think of something we could play maybe to save this segment.  What do you got over there?  I don't know.  Joe's new SARS song.  You like the SARS song?  I don't even know where it is. 
[02:32:00]  You're popping in, too.  I'm going to take a look at the catalog.  There you go.  See what we got.  There's a lot of great stuff.  I'm going to introduce my new character in the next segment.  Oh, really?  What is it?  The wacky phone repairman.  Paid him $100.  Just take the clicking out of the phone.  All right.  Here's Brother Joe singing about SARS.  I'm on a motorboat with three propellers.  Hopefully, this will make you chuckle a little bit.  And we'll return. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Sick with the SARS.  I cough and I wheeze.  That incurable illness.  Thank the Chinese for SARS.  Infected with SARS, I cop him in vain 
[02:33:00]  I must have got it from that chink on the plane with SARS  Sickened by SARS, and it really shows  My right lung exploded and blew out of my nose 
[02:33:30]  It's SARS  Chinese gave me SARS, I am very sick  But I'm not like them, with their really small height and SARS  Opie and Anthony, they jerked off to the Olsen twins

[02:41:30]  Claiming to be the Drill Doe girl  From the other day  Then we gotta get rid of Jim  Bitching about the show  And go right to her  Where's Jim?

Well, that's how Robification  Exification puts me on whack bags  All right, we don't really know  If this is you  From the Drill Doe bit  So  Could you say  Here it is  Please don't stop treating me like a whore?  No, see  You guys have a girl  Screaming their head off  Having an orgasm  And all you guys want to do  Is rip on her accent 
[02:42:00]  No, I just want to know  If it's you  No, we want to make sure  We're talking to the Drill Doe girl  Because you're very famous now  Yeah, so could you say  Please don't stop treating me like a whore?  Please don't stop treating me like a whore  No, but say it like you said it  Hi  You know  Shove a fist up there  And let's get going here  Jesus  It's a lot different  When you have a drill in your pussy  Let me tell you  Yeah, I bet  You are a good egg  Miss  But why don't you improvise?  There's got to be something around the house  Just go into the garage  Get a power tool 
[02:42:30]  Well, actually  I'm in my car driving right now  I can tell it's her  You can tell it's in her voice  You're the Drill Doe girl  It's definitely her  It's definitely the Drill Doe girl  Now, that didn't hurt you at all?  No, actually  Get the lube really good  And it's perfectly fine  And it spins around inside you?  It spins around  It's got to look like twisted taffy  Who are you kidding?  Who are you kidding?  Can I ask what you look like, miss?  Unless you guys have a photo of her 
[02:43:00]  Actually, I have some wow pics  From the old days on Foundry  Are you hot?  Because I don't want fantasy to be wrecked  So I'm really scared to know what you look like  I don't care what she looks like  I like my mind filling in the picture sometimes  But that's no help that Jimmy doesn't care what I look like  No, why would I?  The fact you took a drill in your box  I mean, I can't expect you to be Marilyn Monroe  You are a dirty, filthy girl  I've got to say that  Everyone has been commenting on how dirty you are 
[02:43:30]  That whole  I love her  Come on my face  I just went with the moment  It was good  Don't stop treating me like a whore  I was very surprised you guys didn't pick up on the filthy liberal part  The what?  The filthy liberal  Filthy liberal?  If you listen to the tape again, slow it down  What did you say? Filthy what?  What were you saying?  I was saying filthy liberal  Filthy liberal?  Yes  Oh, wow  So, wait

Actually, we were making the tape for somebody  And I was telling them that I was a filthy liberal  Okay  So, who do you make a tape?  Yeah, who's the tape for if you're making it for somebody?  I don't know  Somebody  Robbification  On the board  And he  Was he selling it?  No  Is there a video of that?

Okay  Well, we'll  We'll put those pictures  We'll look that up  We'll put those pictures front and center  Later on today  Maybe Steve  Check him out on opianthony.com  Now, he came up to you and just said  Hey, I want to make this tape  Audio tape for a friend of mine  Oh, no  We had been  We had dated for a long time  And we still  Fucked for 
[02:45:00]  About  We fucked for about a good two years afterwards  And just for the hell of it  You know, I've got to ask you a question  How do you work up to the drill though?  Maybe you could give some pointers out there  For the couples that are looking to spice up their relationships  I thought he was kidding when he brought it out  But you've got to start somewhere  You can't just all of a sudden just break out the drill though  Well  I would do it anywhere  I would do anything  I would do it anywhere  And then  One night I think we were sitting at dinner 
[02:45:30]  And he went and he turned around  And he said to me  You know what we should do?  We should put a dildo on the end of a drill  Yeah, no, I understand that  But what was the steps in between?  I mean  Did you start with the pinky first of all?  And then work up to a spatula  And then maybe a hairbrush  I mean  Help us out here  You don't go from, you know  F-ing to the drill though  Just like that  Oh no  I mean  We would use the dildo  We would use the vibrators 
[02:46:00]  He would use the fix  Whatever would happen  Yeah  Well  Did your fantasies begin  Like when you're  Does it work into something?  Like you're walking by  And you see a man working a jackhammer on a sidewalk  And you go  I'd like that in my twat  That's good  No, actually  It was his idea  I have to give him that  It was his idea  And he just said  You know, I think that would be cool  Would you be willing to try it?  And I'm always willing to try something on  That's not hostility for the ex-girlfriend  You might have to plug this in  And fuck you with it  You can't have hostility for the ex-girlfriend 
[02:46:30]  I fuck him too good  Really?  Did he start off slow  Or did he just jump right in?  Um  He pretty much jumped right in  From what I remember  Where did you and your mom live  After your dad left?  Actually, my dad still lives with my mother  Yeah?  Uh-huh  Wow  How much time is the uncle doing?  No, can we play a game with her?  Sure  I think it would be nice to have another  What's in my pants 
[02:47:00]  Is that out of line?  Oh, that would be  No, that would be out of line  I don't want to be disrespectful  Had an orgasm on the air  You think that that's going to bother me?  Well, yeah  When you're driving  Your safety comes first  I pulled over to the side of the road  There you go  Are you wearing pants or a skirt?  I'm wearing a skirt  Oh  Could you hike it up?

[02:52:30]  Good listener  Good listener  Very nice  You're, uh, you're, uh, you're, um  You're a, you're a trooper  All right  So why don't we play  Guess What's in My Pants  Okay  All right  If we can have you rub the phone  In an up and down fashion  Okay  Everyone listen  I definitely hear the pothole 
[02:53:00]  A little telling  I definitely hear the pothole  Okay  Okay  Okay  Now if we can have you rub the phone  Side to side  Yes  Yes  Circle?  In a circular fashion  Okay  All right  Now if we can have you take the phone  On the end of a hammer drill  And put it inside you  No?  I thought we'd get that 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, can you put the phone inside  And, and, and, and we'll make a call  It's in the hole  Yes, it is  Yes, it is  Uh, you know, I think I need to hear  Up and down  I'd like to hear again  Up to  All right  If I could  Yeah, up and down  There was something going on there  But I couldn't quite figure it out  Let's listen to up and down  Okay  Hold the gut back  Okay  Very nice  Calorically challenged  Uh, can I try the side to side? 
[02:54:00]  Oh yeah  I, I, I'm  I know this one  I'm trying to use the phone  Yeah  It might be a little rough right now  Yes  All right  And you can't, you don't tell us if we guessed it  Until they actually ask you for the final  That's right  Right, right  Okay, why don't we start  You know what, I want to start, Anthony  Ooh, I'll be starts  Can I  Will we?  Yeah  I want to go with a new guess  A new choice 
[02:54:30]  You  No, it's not bad  I'm going to say she has a five o'clock shadow  All right  A five o'clock shadow  Which is basically a wood floor that wasn't taken care of this morning  It's not maintained  Yeah  Okay  All right  Jimmy  I'm going to say, um  A Hitler  Schultz body, Hitler mustache  That one, I'm drinking coffee 
[02:55:00]  All right  Can I change my guess?  No  Uh, yeah, I guess you can  I'm going to go with the 70s Earth Mama Muff  Because everything grows better in the shade  All right  Are you still there? 
[02:55:30]  I'm still there  Okay  Wow  Most people fall off the horse by now  At least break its back  Right  All right, Anthony  It's to you, I believe  Yeah, yeah  I'm going to say  I heard something going on there  So I'm going to say the Mohawk Opie  That's going to be my guess  The Mohawk  Yeah, yeah  Because I couldn't figure it out  But there's something there  And the little discrepancy in sound 
[02:56:00]  Leads me to believe that it was the Mohawk  But, um  All right  Are we ready to find out?  Um, yeah  Yeah, yeah  All right  Drill whore  What's in your pants?  It would have to be the Mohawk  Yes  I knew I heard something  I think you're two for two, Anthony  No, I didn't get that  Is one out of three or two out of three?  I'm two out of three?  No, one out of three  I'm two out of three  Yeah  One out of three  I'm 0 for 3  But having a great time playing  I thought I heard the discrepancy  But I didn't  And heard it the whole thing 
[02:56:30]  Up and down  I didn't hear it  Yeah, I heard something  Now, the Mohawk  You normally wouldn't hear a discrepancy  Up and down  So that's why it's a little weird  Right  But then side to side  I heard something  A little variation there  So, uh  Yeah  Mohawk, wow  Well, um  We had a few listeners  That wanted to guess  I'm sorry that I got to this  Too late  But Kyle from Manhattan  Wanted to guess  Saddam Hussein's beard  After a month in the spider hole  Uh  Tad from San Francisco  My guess is a Christmas ham  Oh, you people are terrible, man 
[02:57:00]  And Jerry Lee Lewis  From whackbag.com  From Charlotte  Charlotte, North Carolina  Or Charlotte in South Carolina  No, it's in North Carolina, right?  Let's get a map in the studio  So we look smarter  Uh, Jesus  It sounds like a minivan  Driving over speed bumps  Going 55 miles an hour  You know, just so  Just so the listeners  Could, uh  Could learn a little bit better  About this game  Could you do that again  So we could hear the Mohawk?  So, I guess the up and down  Would take care of that, right? 
[02:57:30]  Well, side to side  Up and down  And side to side  All right, let's hear up and down first  This is what a Mohawk sounds like  Oh, yeah  And now the side to side  Okay  You hear it?  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Could you do the circular again?  I want to hear the circular again  Okay  It's probably a hoagie  She's running a road  All right  Okay 
[02:58:00]  Well, yeah  That was great  So you're going to come in next week?  Uh, possibly  Let me, uh, see what's going on  Well, you know  If you're busy, it's okay  No  I'm going to be in there anyway  But let me, uh, make sure that, uh  Well, we don't want to push you out or anything  I mean, if you  You know, if you've got something else going on  We understand  We can reschedule  Okay  We'll say that next week, okay?  But if you can come in  And we're going to have  Uh, we're going to try to get the lesbian, um 
[02:58:30]  Uh, couch  And, uh, you know  If you want to come in  I think it'd be nice to, uh  To see you come in  And, uh, you know  Try it out a little bit  Yeah, I mean  Some of the bits we do for the show  We do in the other room without microphones  I mean, uh, you know  Lesbians  Equal ratings  That's right, Howard  All right  So I guess  How old are the pics, by the way  If I didn't mean to interrupt  How old are the old pics?  Um, maybe about  A year or so old  Oh, good  I'm not sure  I think the date's on there  Um, I only have 
[02:59:00]  Um  A printout  Which  Went wrong  Can I, um  Can you maybe send the after pictures?

Well, you know what?  I'm trying to do it in a different tone, if you will. 
[03:05:00]  But not a man's?  Yeah, you should be very angry and aggressive in that song.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Honestly, I'm going to play punch you in the twat.  Yeah, you sound like you're ready for the Broadway channel with that.  I was trying to duplicate exactly what the old one sounded like.  Wasn't the old song A Girl, though?  No, it was Jimmy.

Okay, now, I printed a video from your store.  Okay.  And it's for my little boy's birthday party.  Oh, heaven.  Okay, now, I got a room full of little boys, a couple little girls, about to watch this damn video. 
[03:06:00]  I leave the room.  I come back, and the screen ain't nothing but naked ass.  Oh, my God.  Somebody's home video is in this little children's movie box.  Oh, my God.  I got Child Protective Services up my ass now, because all the parents got pissed, because  they little children are seeing this mess, and now they think I'm a pervert. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my Lord.  That ain't no Rugrats.  I know what the Rugrats look like.  Yes, ma'am.  Obviously, it was in the wrong case, and...  You know what scared me to death?  Some of the kids said they already seen that movie.  Oh, my Lord.  Now, my little boy, he having nightmares all night.  He talking about old mama, the giant one-eyed snakes chasing me around the room.  Oh, Lord.  Now, first of all, the quality was poor.  The lightning was just horrible. 
[03:07:00]  But let me tell you what was on there.  Now, this woman, she spread eagle.  Spread eagle on her back.  And then this one guy, he jumped off the bedpost and, bam, right on in that thing.  Oh, my Lord.  Yeah.  That looked right painful to me.  Oh.  And then there was another man.  He was taking his penis and just smacking her across the forehead. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, God.  I mean, they abused that woman.  Oh.  And he had a big old donkey dick.  I mean, that thing was about 15 inches long.  Oh, my Lord.  It looked like a daggone pornographic Cirque du Soleil up in there.  Oh, God.  Now, my son, he go, Mama, can we see that movie again?  Can we see that movie again?  Oh, Lord.  Um, if you, um, can bring that back, I can change it for anything else that you want. 
[03:08:00]  Okay.  I tell you what, I'm going to bring it in there.  Maybe we can watch it together.  Because, you know, that double penetration thing, I don't get it.  Uh, me either.  Yeah, you just got to fill up everything.  You know, leave some breathing room.  Yes, ma'am, you're right.  I tell you, boy, you should see, look at that, look at that.  My son over there, humping, look at him, just humping the floor.  Look at him, humping, humping, humping.  He just, you know, he's just been humping everything now that he's seen that movie. 
[03:08:30]  I'm terribly, terribly sorry.  All right, well, look, I got to go, I got choir practice.  Okay.  Okay, praise the Lord.  Have a nice day.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.

[03:09:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out.  And thanks for helping us out with the whole virus thing.  What's wrong, Jim Norton?  I'm just, as we're coming back from break, watching this.  What is this show at Regis?  Good Morning America?  Regis and Kelly.  I don't even know what it's called.  No, because you're never up this early.  Until recently, but.  I just don't.  It's amazing to me the forced cuteness that people buy into.  Dude, she's hot.  I'm not saying, dude, please.  She's a dirty girl, too, by the way. 
[03:10:00]  I would torture her for hours.  She takes the drill, though?  She's a very dirty girl, yes.  How do you know?  You could just tell, and she was on our show before she got really famous, and you could  just tell by talking to her that she's a dirty girl.  She's had how many kids, though?  You don't know what kind of wreckage is down there.  Yeah.  Aw, man.  Some of the girls could keep it together after they have the kids.  You know something?  That really is a turn-off.  Eh.  What am I going to say?  I know Opie's into that.  You like the pregnant chicks.  Do you really?  He had a pregnant chick come into the studio once.  He'd get naked and do a retarded dance in front of him. 
[03:10:30]  Big areolas with milk leaking out of him?  Yeah.  It's called a lap dance.  Yeah, it's one of my weird fetishes.  I have a few weird ones, too, but not prey.  I like just being her to be involved.  I don't need a little rug rat in there in the belly.  In there, grabbing at your junk as it thrusts into his head.  Yeah.  Into the soft spot.  Yeah.  Fire some into the soft spot.  You pull it out, your mule smells like saline because there's placenta on it.  That's great.  I'm going to give the little fetus the Kennedy treatment and blast him in the head. 
[03:11:00]  Jesus.  That's it.  Look at his fat little fetus head back and to the left.  The music interlude of the O&A show.  Oh, really?  What is this?  You make me feel so young.  Ah, the Regis CD.  You make me feel so spring-a-sprung.  When you shove a dildo in my hand, you make me feel so young, Gilman.  I'm such a happy individual the moment that you speak. 
[03:11:30]  Oh.  I want to go play hide and seek.  In your pussy!  I want to go and bounce the moon.  Wow.  Just like a toy balloon.  You and I are just like a couple of tots.  Tots.  Running across the meadow.  Picking up lots of forget-me-nots. 
[03:12:00]  Oh.  You make me feel so young.  You make me feel so young.  You make me feel there are songs to be sung.  Like when I was high.  There are songs to be rung.  A wonderful fling to be flown.  And even when I'm old and gray.  Like now?  That is some awful music, man.  It's wonderful when a celebrity puts out a music CD.  I love these things.  You know what that's called? 
[03:12:30]  That's called when you get to a point in the business where nobody around you is comfortable  enough to go, dude, that stinks.  That's awfulness.  People, you think anybody he knows likes that?  You think anyone's going, boy, that was terrific.  Not someone he knows, but I know someone that likes it and probably plays it on his show.  Who?  Now you think that's being played on Frank's Place?  Oh, probably.  I bet.  Here's the latest one from Regis.  Regis.  Oh, it's the song that's gotta be.  Oh, picking up forget-me-nots. 
[03:13:00]  Forget-me-nots.  No, I can't.  Like a toy balloon.  Ugh.  Just stay away from the coon.  We're running around like a couple of tots.  Like tots.  I can't, uh...

It was like, Regis sings  all of your favorite hits from the past.  I was like, what?  Really?  At least when William Shatner does it, he knows he stinks it.  You make me feel so young.

Back then, today's technology may have seemed like something out of a James Bond movie.  But today's digital lifestyle is more than science fiction.  It's a fact of life, as three out of four Americans have access to the internet  and nearly half of the U.S. population has been online for five or more years.  MSN's Christine Andrews  The internet has revolutionized our lives. 
[03:36:00]  From electronic mail to online shopping and bill paying,  consumers have really benefited from the technology.  At MSN.com, consumers can access news, entertainment, and communication tools all in one place.  And free features, such as MSN Video, make it clear that the web is beginning to replace traditional media.  Supporting this trend is the 50% increase in broadband adoption,  which has resulted in web users watching five hours less TV a week than non-internet users.  I'm Dave Graveline.

[03:37:30]  Hm.  It's fucking stupid.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Corn doing word up.  You're checking out the O-N-A virus. 
[03:38:00]  We've had a lot of fun so far today.  Oh, yeah.  At everyone else's expense.  I love it.  You know what's cool about Satellite Radio?  We can tease the show that we're doing right now.  Ooh.  If you want to hear a lot of cursing,  Uh-oh.  You might want to tune in right when this show ends for the beginning of the show.  That happened only a few hours ago.  Yeah, I think Opie hit a one-month curse limit.  We walked into a... 
[03:38:30]  I think you used up all your curses for the month, Opie.  We walked into a cluster F, and, uh...  And, uh, yeah, you'll get to hear all about it in about 25 minutes, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Also, the Swedish gaming chicks from today's show.  Yeah.  Not a bad segment, but you might want to, you know, go outside and smoke a cigarette during  that break.  Not bad, though.  That would be the segment.  A couple giggles.  If you're a person that listens to the show religiously from beginning to end, can't get  away from the radio, uh, there is that interview where if you do have to do something, we're 
[03:39:00]  letting you know in advance.  That's the time to do it.  Yeah, that might...  Yeah, you can step aside if you're...  Yeah.  If you...  When you hear her say, hey, Swedish...  Hot Swedish girls coming in that do a lot of gaming...  Yeah.  ...and you think in your head, this could be a really good segment...  No, leave.  Eh, so-so.  What went on during that segment?  Nothing.  You could, uh, jump into the grocery store and get some, uh, get some of your chores  done.  If you hear us say Frenchie...  Yeah.  Smoke a butt.  Yeah.  Go out.  Frenchie, yeah, you're not missing much.  Um, if you have a visual in your head as far as the Drill Doe Girl goes, make sure you 
[03:39:30]  don't listen to that segment.  Wait a minute, they're not going to listen to any of the show today.  Hmm, that's true.  Yeah.  And there was a few segments where we, quite frankly, pulled it out of our ass today.  Well, coming off of the beginning of the show with everything not working and then  getting into the show, you know.  Right.  There's a lot of people waking up right now.  When you, when, uh, when you're listening a little later and all of a sudden you see  us just staring at, well, see us, you hear us, I guess, uh, staring at the TV and we 
[03:40:00]  go, oh, Regis, I swear to you, you're going to want to listen to that part of the show.  There were some real zingers in there.  At first you're going to go, nah, they're talking about Regis.  No, trust me, you're going to want to hear all about Regis today.  Of course.  It's kind of cool.  You can tease the, the show as it's in progress.  Pretty messed up.  What the fuck is going on?  Go to the fridge and get me another beer!  What else?  Did we cover all the subjects today?  Ah, whatever. 
[03:40:30]  Not sure.  That's, that's, that's, that's good.  That's good enough.  Another great story in the paper today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Man staged robbery to impress wife.  Man.  This is unbelievable.  That's what us guys do for the, for the bitches.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  Yeah.  Edmond, Oklahoma.  I thought Edmond was in, uh, Canada.  That's Edmonton.  Oh, Edmond.  Edmond, Oklahoma.  I'm telling you, we need a map.  Yeah, we need a big map.  And then you can figure out where Cleveland is.  And we can put pins in it and pull them out with them. 
[03:41:00]  Cleveland's in the South and you turn it sideways.  Yeah.  We can put pins in the map like we're going on a trip somewhere.  That's right.  And then pull them out all disappointed with our big, fat, self-suffocating head.  Didn't we do that after we got canceled from the other gig?  Yes.  All the, all the cities we were supposed to be syndicated in, that just never happened.  We pulled the pins out like that big, Rocky Dennis fat head.  Tears running down those fat cheeks and drying before they hit the chin.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, Paul's a little confused. 
[03:41:30]  Let's go to Paul.  Yeah.  Paul in Texas.  Yes, Paul.  Good morning, guys.  How y'all doing this morning?  Pretty good, Paul.  And listen, I've got a question for you.  Uh, I'm calling from D.B.  Texas.  Yeah.  And, uh, I just realized that y'all have an entire huge range of freedom to do what a  lot of these other radio shows cannot do.  Yeah.  And, but you're not taking advantage of any of it.  And I was really kind of curious as to why.  What do you mean we're not taking advantage of it?  We're completely...  With all the news, the stuff going on, with all of these, I mean, I can't even watch the 
[03:42:00]  news in the mornings because of the fact that everybody's such, I mean, I'm not saying  that I'm for or against Kerry, but everybody's for Kerry, especially the media, that you  can't get an unbiased...  Oh my God, not everyone's for Kerry.  Right.  So we're supposed to do...  Obviously you don't have the Fox News channel on your cable service.  We're supposed to do a political show then, you're saying, Paul?  No, no, sir.  I'm just saying you've got a wide range of scope, but I don't...  All right, give us a subject, we'll do some improv for you.  All right, go ahead.  We'll do a little riffing.  What do you want us to talk about?  Right in a second.  I want to talk about the elections and the debates. 
[03:42:30]  I wanted to see what y'all was going to use on the...  Oh, we did that already.  But if you want to hear some debate talk, I'm happy to do a little bit of debate talk.  All right.  Matt Kerry's a dumb cunt.  Bush, fuck his mother.  All right, what else?  Yeah, that covers it.  That's pretty close.  That's what I was asking, but I just...  Because I keep tired of hearing one side of the story.  Y'all have the chance to hit it all without being censored.  You're saying that the media is very liberally oriented, right?  Oh, my God, extremely.  I agree.  Y'all know that.  I agree.  Unless you're watching the Fox News channel.  No, I don't... 
[03:43:00]  I can't...  I work so much that I really get a chance to watch.  Hey, it ain't over until John Edwards' wife sings, so we're hanging in there.  Stumbled across it.  It almost was good.  What kind of work do you do?  Paul?  Corrections officer, I bet.  Hey, Paul.  I work for the big red oil company.  Hey, Paul, you're wrecking our show.  You really are.  I'm wrecking the show?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  You're being serious.  Yeah.  B-X-M.  Yeah.  All right, we gotta go.  All right.  Bye, Paul.  There goes Paul. 
[03:43:30]  There goes Paul wondering why we don't have a format to our show and talk about politics.  He's a little confused.  I think he is.  He doesn't hate the show.  He's just wondering why we don't hit the liberals.  He's right to wonder that.  Edmond, Oklahoma.  Ah.  An Oklahoma man desperate to save...  See, here's a news story, Paul.  Oklahoma man.  Here's a news story, Paul.  It's a new segment of the show.  A little news.  Where's our laughing black lady?  An Oklahoma man desperate to save his marriage by appearing like a hero to his wife ended up 
[03:44:00]  in police custody on suspicion of staging a crime, Anthony.  Yeah.  He hired burglars and foiled their fake robbery attempt, police said on Friday.  Listen to this scam.  This guy trying to...  Does this guy watch any shows like Cops or anything thinking he was going to get away  with this one?  Unbelievable.  Trent Spencer was charged this week with the misdemeanor crime of filing a false report.  According to police, Spencer, a high school teacher paid two students $100 each to break  into his house and try to make off with a stereo.  The masked students tied his wife with duct tape. 
[03:44:30]  Nice.  They should have banged her right in front of them.  And go, what?  Like, hey, we'll show you.  What?  You hired us to do this.  We're just trying to make it look realistic.  Yeah.  What happened?  Tied his wife with duct tape and her husband was in the house just in time to foil the  supposed crime.  Police said Spencer attacked the two in a choreographed fight.  Jesus.  It must have looked so bad.  A choreographed fight.  It probably looked like an old Batman episode. 
[03:45:00]  Or WWF or something.  Smashing with a chair.  I'll save my wife.  Even hitting one with a board that he had cut to break in half.  Come on.  Rachel, you're duct taped.  The burglars have come back.  He cut the board in half so it would break easily.  Yeah, he cut the board so when he smacks it over someone's head, it breaks.  Was the rock there? 
[03:45:30]  Let's see.  Even hitting one with a board that he had cut to break in half.  The plan was going well until his wife freed herself.  Yeah, they couldn't even duct tape her, right?  They called police.  Then the cops show up.  They're probably in mid-fight and their stories don't jive and that's it.  But that is an example.  Now, the guy did this in the first place because his wife, I guess, was leaving him.  So he figures if he can save her, he comes up with this little scheme.  And you know what the bottom line is, dude? 
[03:46:00]  You just got to face it and move on.  Yeah.  And just move on.  Guys get crazy like this.  And when I read this story, it reminded me of me being, I think, 13 or 14 years old.  And my little girlfriend broke up with me.  And I swear, I was like, oh my God, what am I going to do?  I took a bat and tried to break my arm with a bat to get the sympathy thing.  Like, that was going to do anything.  Like, that was going to help.  But, you know, you think back at your youth. 
[03:46:30]  Well, what were we going to tell her happened?  That I felt so young.  I took a bat over my arm.  The bitch still didn't come back.  That's what?  I'm trying to follow the logic.  So you break your arm and then what do you tell her?  That, oh my God, my arm is broke.  You know, you can't leave me now.  Why, was it your right arm?  Yeah, right?  I need some.  No, just thinking that there would be sympathy there.  Yeah, but you do it with your left.  It feels like someone else.  No, it doesn't.  Yes, it does.  Because you don't have a hand free to hold a pistol. 
[03:47:00]  Also, you're not as coordinated with your left hand.  I know.  So you wind up getting off rhythm.  Yeah, and you can't simulate someone else.  Even though you get the off rhythm, which feels like a girl, you can't have the incessant babble  where you have to look away because you're thinking about somebody else.  There's a lot of differences.  You can't punch it in the face.  This shows you how far guys will go, though.  Yeah.  A hundred bucks to each student. 
[03:47:30]  Was that what he paid?  Yeah.  You could have given him 200.  They would have killed her, stupid.  I mean, if he had ten students like this, all our troubles here would be over very quickly.  But you're hoping to get the sympathy thing, or in his case, the hero thing.  But, you know, it's something to do when you're a dopey kid, but not a grown man.  Yeah.  To try to pull off that scam.  Apparently it doesn't teach the drama club because nobody could act well enough to get this done. 
[03:48:00]  I'm robbing you!  I'll save you, honey!  Meanwhile, she's untaped herself.  She's cut both of her balls off.  She's down in the closet.  She's calling the police.  This idiot's breaking, like, you know, perforated boards.  She's coming in wearing silent movie, 20s makeup, the pancake.  Piano player in the background.  All right, you guys, put little mustaches on yourself and tire to the train tracks. 
[03:48:30]  The rent is due.  I'll save you.  What a complete ass.  Oh, what a...  The only guy who I...  Can I just mention the one guy who's my new idol?  Yeah.  Is the psychiatrist who got a ticket.  And he paid...  What he did was all the money.  I guess he didn't like the ticket.  So he rubbed feces on the bills and mailed them in.  That old gag.  I love it.  Very dirty money might land shrink in jail. 
[03:49:00]  He's a shrink, too, and he does something like this?  I guess he knows the effect it will have on you.  Good thing I didn't work there.  Why is that man smelling the money and masturbating?  What a waste of good duty.  I know.  It said he smeared excrement on the dollar bills,  and his law argument is that he dropped them in the toilet.  Oh, accidentally?  Yeah.  How moist are your logs?  And what are you doing with your billfold over the bowl?  And do you not dry them off and just put new bills in there?  What a weak argument that is.  You go to a strip club sometimes, 
[03:49:30]  and you realize why you shouldn't put money in your mouth.  Because some of them are hot,  but you get some pig day dancers at some of the...  Especially local Long Island out here in New York.  Some of those local ones in Bronkonkoma by the train station,  where you come out at noon and you're blinded by the sun  like you just got out of solitary confinement.  That's the AAA squad.  Those girls with the cesarean section scars.  Trying to work their way up to the big legs.  Oof.  Awful.  And they take the dollar bills and think it looks hot  to make a little tail on themselves with a folded buck on the G-string. 
[03:50:00]  And you look at that and just go,  Oh, I should never handle money at all, ever, ever.  Did I tell you about the strip club I went to when I was doing that MTV pilot?  No.  Specifically in upstate New York.  I never got a Hummer or anything in a strip club.  This place I did.  I got a Hummer.  I got a Handy.  But one of the girls, the girls were great.  Totally nude.  And one of the girls had...  I was with two of the sound guys,  and she had a yeast infection.  This was absolutely true.  And it was a white, milky...  Oh, God.  ...substance. 
[03:50:30]  It was...  It looked like...  It looked like her vagina was depressed and taking Paxil.  Because you know, like that little white buildup you get in the corner of your mouth  from antidepressants?  It was horrendous.  And I showed the other guy I was with.  I'm like, look, that's an yeast infection.  And he's like, yeah, it is.  And you were so excited.  No, it's just awful.  You're a bang, and you pull your mule out,  and it's got that awful skim milk in your pubes.  All right, that's the powdered milk.  Oh, God.  But you know the substance?  It's like a milky...  Who are you with?  Come on, you never had that? 
[03:51:00]  Any girl can get a yeast infection.  This was a stripper, and her breath was horrendous, too.  Ew.  That was disgusting, Steve.  Thanks.  It really was.  Thanks, Steve.  I didn't know where it was coming from.  It frightened me.  You make me feel so nauseous.  Steve had taped himself in Cleveland.  That's where he got that.  That could be any city we were in.  I was with the stripper beast full of yeast.  Ugh.  I got an observation about the Open Anthony show.  We probably got like 20 newspapers in the studio.  You make me feel like I dipped it in Elmer's glue with that white goo. 
[03:51:30]  Look at the one newspaper no one opened today.  The Times.  The New York Times.  The New York Times figures.  Maybe that guy from Texas had a point.  Go right to the Weekly World News and did the alien speak with Bush?  Right.  Look at it.  It's all neat.  Yeah.  All the sections still intact?  Mm-hmm.  No one touched it.  They're speculating that Bush had a wire running up his back.  There was something in the paper and they showed a picture of him.  He's got this square box.  I noticed that too.  He's got a box on his back. 
[03:52:00]  It looks like, yeah, a little bit of a hump on the upper part of his back.  Is anyone fessing up to what it is?  I know what it is.  It's armor.  That's all it is.  Because there's no wires to his ear, right?  They don't need body armor like that on his back.  What, did he put it on backwards?  Well, what else?  Body armor is so light now.  Yeah.  Well, it's got to be some kind of protection.  That's all.  It's a wire or a transmitter.  But where's the wire?  You think he had something actually, a wireless thing in his ear?  Yeah.  He could have.  Someone said that's why he was blinking so much, because he was acknowledging that. 
[03:52:30]  Getting messages from the mothership.  He got the messages from Chaney.  That was a terrible job, whoever was into his ear.  All right.  Just look stupid and shrug.  Blink a lot.  Good.  Good.  Yeah, here it is.  There isn't a thimble full of doubt that President Bush had something foreign under his suit jacket  during the first two debates.  They had to ask an expert, a tailor.  And this tailor says, maybe a back brace or some kind of body armor.  That's what he's thinking it is.  Oh, I thought they maybe asked Liz Taylor. 
[03:53:00]  Two weeks.  And then this is his joke.  A lot of good jokes in the papers today.  Then again, maybe all Bush's winking was at the guy feeding him information, and he kept  jumping off that stool like he just got an answer.  He wouldn't be.  They wouldn't have.  On national TV, they're not going to say wink if you get the answer.  You know?  Why don't they just have him clap real quick?  No one's going to do something that obvious on TV.  Stupid speculation.  And we didn't get to the Michael Jackson story. 
[03:53:30]  We could do some.  Michael Jackson never goes away.  Yeah, who did he sink it into?  How old aren't they?  Well, the king of pop is hip-hopping mad about being dissed in Eminem's new music video.  And he's fighting back, his rep said yesterday.  Uh-oh.  Michael Jackson's fighting back.  Fighting back.  Yeah.  Michael Jackson is very angry.  He feels that Eminem has crossed the line.  Oh, Eminem's crossed the line.  Let's talk about crossing the line, Michael.  That's right.  Michael is calling upon all networks to pull the video. 
[03:54:00]  The furor erupted over a music vid promo.  The furor?  I erupted?  Erupted over a music vid promo for the new single in which Eminem nastily mocks Jackson about the child sexual abuse allegations he is facing.  Well, why would Michael object to that?  Sorry, pal.  No one told you to have sex and have your cock smell like Similac.  That was your doing.  Allegedly.  Ah, he's a disgusting pedophile. 
[03:54:30]  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Just joking, Mike.  Stop hanging out with kids, you fucking predator.  And to you, the American public, your children deserve to get raped because you continually put them in the hands of this predator.  Yeah, whoever, whatever kids have been abused by Michael Jackson, allegedly, abused by Michael Jackson, the parents are so to blame.  And they are still sending kids to hang out with this guy.  As they should.  I'm not saying it's wrong.  It's like if Michael buys them Rolls Royces, you know, Daddy, my bottom hurts. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, well, do you smell the leather interior, Mr. Selfish?  Can you finally give something back to this family after six years?  Daddy, I need Doritos.  Daddy, I need milk in my lunchbox.  Well, that little ass won't be nice forever.  Someone had to break it in like a catcher's mitt.  It was laid under a heavy half a Negro and a sheet.  It just kind of got pressed in.  You've got some issues.  I don't have issues.  And America doesn't want to acknowledge, allegedly, that he's a pedophile because it's a reflection 
[03:55:30]  on them.  Wow, we had this guy ten years ago and we ignored it and he still kept doing it while  we danced like a bunch of assholes to his records.  I wasn't dancing.  Me neither.  I can't dance because I'm white.  Wait till you hear that bit tomorrow.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Ugh.  Fucking white guy's safe.  We can't dance, can we?  He's right.  They can't dance.  So, one scene in this Eminem video shows Eminem dressed up like Jackson, sitting on a bed  with little boys jumping in the background. 
[03:56:00]  That's nice.  The lyric says, come here, little kitty.  Come here, little kitty.  On my lap.  Guess who's back with a brand new rap?  And I don't mean rap as in a new case.  A child molestates and accusates.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  No worries.  Papa's got a brand new bag of toys.  What else could I possibly do to make noise?  I done touched on everything.  But little boy, that's not a stab at Michael.  That's not the metaphor.  I'm just psycho.  I go a little bit crazy sometimes.  I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes.  Good God, Nick.  Look, he's just trying to rhyme things. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  You know, everyone that tries to look too deep into what Eminem's doing, that's awful.  He's talking about the homosexuals, or he's talking about Michael Jackson, or he's talking  about, you know, the guy's just rhyming stuff and making boatloads of cash.  Absolutely.  And the word mile happens to rhyme with pedophile.  Right.  There you go.  Eminem, how great is Eminem?  I didn't want to like him.  I didn't want to.  I mean, I like Eminem a lot.  God damn, he's good.  Hey, let's do, what do we learn real fast?  People like this part of the show.  Slews from Jersey.  It's like college today, this show.

[03:58:30]  I learned some things grow better in the shade.  Are we out of here, Steve?  You got 30 seconds.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, I have a whole new idea.  Plenty of time.  Oh, we might be able to go to a phone here.  Let's go to another Jersey caller.  George, what's going on?  Very educational show.  Just want to let you know that blonde twats and then going to baseball is not more good  and always making fun of people with birth defects.  Very funny.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  It really sucks that we had 30 seconds left in the show.

[04:01:00]  Next is SpamSlicer.com presents Megabyte Minute.  Thanks for tuning in.  I'm David Radin on XM Satellite Radio.  While problems with bootleg movies, illegal music downloads and other copyright confusion circulate, 
[04:01:30]  TiVo asked the FCC to let its subscribers be able to upload and send television programs over the internet.  Sounds like a big no-no, but the FCC okayed the policy, stating that the digital video recorder company's safety controls are acceptable.  TiVo's feature could only be used to send programs to register devices, like other rooms, or the weekend retreat in the mountains.  The shows could also be encrypted to prevent piracy on the internet.  I'm David Radin.
