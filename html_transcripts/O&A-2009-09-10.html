<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts recounting a past show where E-Rock was extremely nervous, before transitioning to a discussion of President Obama's healthcare address, which clashed with Opie's *America's Got Talent* viewing.  They criticized the simultaneous airing across numerous channels, longing for the simpler three-network era and speculating about the reasons behind the current practice â€“ bidding wars or a rotating system.  The discussion branched into cable TV features like picture-in-picture and on-demand viewing, then briefly touched upon Derek Jeter tying Lou Gehrig's record, criticizing John Sterling's commentary and contrasting it with past enthusiastic reactions by Susan Waldman.  Obama's speech was further criticized, along with the Republican response, specifically Joe Wilson's "You lie!" outburst.  The hosts discussed potential VP candidates (Hillary Clinton), high healthcare costs, and their cynicism towards both Democrats and Republicans, concluding that neither party offered real tax relief.  Personal anecdotes regarding interracial couples, sleep schedules, and family matters were interspersed throughout.

The show continued with a discussion of the challenges of grassroots political organizing compared to the perceived ease of mobilization on the far left and right.  The rising cost of living and the financial strain of vacations were contrasted with their childhood experiences. Obama was called a "fucking socialist," and the hosts joked about their ancestors' low tax rates in England, settling (and later having confirmed by a caller, Keith) on a 3% increase under the 1765 Stamp Act.  This led to a discussion of historical accuracy and the gradual nature of tax increases.  The conversation then shifted to the upcoming "Fur Fright" event, Steve Jobs' health, and Apple product announcements.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to criticizing a disastrous Jay-Z interview by Lisa Page on a competing station, playing clips of her inane questions focusing on mundane details rather than his music or the upcoming 9/11 tribute concert.  The hosts played snippets of Jay-Z's music ("99 Problems," "H to the Izzo"), debating the concert's opportunistic nature.  Discussions included anecdotes about attending hip-hop concerts,  a humorous anecdote about a Target cashier commenting on one of the host's racial ambiguity, and fears about attending a Jay-Z concert.  A call from Larry King featured inappropriate and rambling comments, concluding with a racially charged bit and the hosts' uncomfortable reaction.

The show then heavily focused on Tyra Banks' talk show episode about menstruation, with vulgar and sexually explicit commentary from the hosts and callers, including numerous offensive terms.  They engaged in Google bombing of phrases like "Tyra's clumpy heavy flow," shared anecdotes, and numerous calls from a Larry King impersonator further fueled the raunchiness.  Discussions included a caller's first period experience, the smell and physical manifestations of menstruation, and comparisons of menstrual blood to other bodily fluids.  Comedian Jim Jefferies joined the show, bringing discussions of his experiences, his views on pornography (including illegal and disturbing content), and a humorous anecdote about his mother catching him masturbating.  The segment concluded with further sexually explicit jokes.


With Jim Jefferies as an in-studio guest, the show continued with anecdotes about childhood masturbation, a disturbing video of bestiality, and a comedic audio piece detailing Anthony Cumia's purported guide to self-oral sex.  A listener's call led to a discussion of Michael Vick and dog fighting, followed by a soundbite of a coworker defecating.  The hosts and Jefferies discussed toilets and bathroom experiences across different countries, before moving to scat porn and anal sex, with Jefferies sharing a personal anecdote.  A *Family Guy* clip featuring Stewie Griffin was played.  The final major topic was cricket, with Jefferies explaining the rules and intricacies to the hosts using video clips and humorous analogies.

The final segment, also featuring Jim Jefferies, continued the cricket discussion, covering the differences between cricket and baseball bats, the scoring system in AFL, and the infamous underarm bowling incident.  Callers compared explaining cricket to Americans to teaching chess to monkeys and defended baseball's simplicity.  Another call from a Larry King impersonator prompted a bizarre tangent about George Lucas and dwarfs, followed by discussions about physical disabilities and dating, and a description of a short woman engaged to a tall man.  The hosts and Jefferies riffed on obtaining nude photos, potential future sex tapes, and Jefferies promoted his stand-up shows.  The segment concluded with a "Line of the Day" and a recollection of Marion Barry's infamous "crack in that pipe" quote.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  That opener always gets me going.  I know.  I'd rather die.  There's some funny things on that opener.  That was the day, I think, you called him sick.  Jimmy wasn't around.  Yeah.  So it was me and the youngins.  You and the kids.  Me and the kids, and Danny was calm.  Sam was calm.  Yeah.  Travis, calm.  And E-Rock was a nervous wreck.  Losing his mind.  Losing his fucking mind.  I'm like, E-Rock, relax, I got this.  Was he putting on his E-Rock radio guy voice whenever he talked? 
[00:00:30]  He was just sweating a lot.  He felt a lot of pressure that day for some reason.  I don't understand the E-Rock sometimes.  He'll do that.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  Oh, my goodness.  So I'll tell you this much.  I wanted to watch America's Got Talent.  Yeah.  A show we don't really talk about much on the show.  But it's a big show. 
[00:01:00]  A bunch of people are watching it out there.  Really big shoe.  And it was the results show where you find out who's going to the finals last night.  And I'm like, ooh.  Got home from dinner.  And I decide, all right, I'm going to watch a little TV.  Right.  And I put America's Got Talent on.  And there's Obama speaking.  He could have been solving the world's problems.  I was so fucking pissed that it was preempting my show.  Oh, I thought you meant he was on America's Got Talent.  Can you imagine?  Yeah.  I want to be your president. 
[00:01:30]  But when the president, I don't care if you like or hey.  I don't even feel like going down that road right this second.  But when you tune in your favorite show and the president is interrupting it, you immediately hate the president.  Yeah.  You now don't like him.  Yeah.  You're like, I wanted to watch something.  And he's interrupting.  He was interrupting.  He's interrupting.  My night.  My fun and my viewing pleasure.  And this isn't 1972 anymore.  I just threw a weird year out there.  Yeah, it was a good year.  Why don't all the networks and all the cable channels get together and go, okay, it's your turn. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And then have the president on that channel.  Why does it have to be on every fucking channel?  Oh, it goes around like, all right, well, it's CNN's turn.  Right.  That's it.  All the other channels play this stuff.  Apparently, I guess.  You know what?  Have them bid for it.  Yeah.  Make it a moneymaker.  Have them bid.  Who wants to have the president's speech?  I guess Fox 5 didn't decide not to carry it.  I don't know, man.  They just played regular programming or something.  Oh, really? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Fox decided to fuck him.  Well, good for them.  Well, that's Rupert Murdoch.  But you know what?  They got the Fox News channel.  That's all sort of connected.  Fox News channel kind of play.  So they figured, look, we already are using one of our channels.  I lost track at, I think, 12.  Yeah.  12 channels were showing the speech.  I'm like, why?  And does anyone know why that started?  I don't know.  They've always done that, though.  Even when there were just the three networks, ABC, NBC, and CBS, growing up.  Remember that?  No.  You're a lot older than me. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, right.  Well, Opie, let me tell you a little story.  Years ago, there were three little networks.  I always had cable.  I don't know what you're talking about.  CBS, NBC, and ABC.  And we used to have to fiddle with the rabbit ears.  That two-year difference is a big difference.  Is that a big difference?  Oh, yeah.  You lie, Opie.  I remember having a cable box always.  Always.  Well.  Which got the scrambled porn, by the way.  I remember three networks. 
[00:03:30]  But I never understood why they each had to play the president speaking.  Why would you pick one over the other?  I understand, like, after he was done, they would have that little commentary by the anchors.  Sure.  You know, maybe this one had Cronkite.  This one had the other guy.  Cronkite?  Cronkite.  I only remember Dan Rather.  Dan Rather?  How old are you?  Well, but I do.  Those two years really do make a difference.  Hey, when did Cronkite retire?  Come on.  I don't know.  In the 60s?  Help a brother out. 
[00:04:00]  In the 60s?  And not in the 60s.  What did he make it to?  I think he made it to.  I think he made it into the 80s.  I think he made it to maybe 80.  Maybe 81.  Because who took over for him?  Was it Brokaw or something?  I have no idea.  No, it was Rather.  I don't know what it was.  Was it Rather?  Yeah, then Rather stepped in and was such a.  Blech, dud.  Just like yick.  It just didn't compare to Mr. Cronkite.  Mr. Cronkite.  Who was memorialized here in New York yesterday.  Memorialized in the city when President Obama showed up and so did President Clinton. 
[00:04:30]  Clinton was there too?  Yeah, Clinton was there.  He was talking about how it was kind of amazing that Obama showed up for it since he had such  an important speech to deliver that evening.  Down in Washington.  Yeah, but I think it was just FaceTime that wasn't people yelling at him.  It was him being able to show up at an event and Walter Cronkite's dead.  It's a memorial.  So it's like I could show up at this and not be yelled at or anything?  No one's going to judge me on what I'm doing here or anything? 
[00:05:00]  Great.  I'm there.  I could have a little fun, actually.  You could actually have some fun.  That hair is turning gray fast.  Oh, my God.  The fastest in history.  Isn't it?  Bush has turned gray fast, but his father's hair never turned gray.  Nah.  Until, I don't know, I think recently.  But anyway, why the three networks?  Yeah, like we're on a little tangent here.  Yeah, why would they do that?  If you could just have one network do it and then have your little commentary afterwards. 
[00:05:30]  No, and have your little America's Got Talent on your channel.  There was nothing.  And you know what, though?  There was nothing else to put on.  What the fuck were they going to put on back then anyway?  True.  But now, like you said, yeah, you want to watch America's Got Talent.  Are they trying to force us all to watch it?  I think they feel they're going to get better ratings than the other channel that is carrying it based on who's going to talk after the speech.  So they've got to carry the whole speech.  Because if, like, ABC carries it, then the guy on CBS, no one's going to be watching. 
[00:06:00]  You're not going to change to hear what he has to say.  You're just going to listen to the babble and the Republican response and all that shit on the channel that you saw the speech on.  So they all carry it.  How about a picture in picture?  Pip.  I like to call it.  Yeah, a little pip action.  A little pip.  I've never been.  I can't figure out my pip.  I'm not a big pip fan.  I can't even figure it out.  Yeah, you can't even figure it out?  Nope.  Technology in me, not good.  I've been pipping the Yankee games occasionally, and boy, it's hard to see a score. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, there's a little pip screen.  The writing gets really small even on an 80-inch TV.  Yeah, because I'm watching, like, you know, A&E.  I'm watching some kind of murder show.  And, you know, you get the Yankees on there.  And it's very hard to see the score.  Do you have DirecTV?  No, I have.  Are we allowed to promote DirecTV?  Which one are we?  What have we got in here?  This company is in bed with which one?  Time Warner?  No, I mean, there's the satellite TV thing.  It's DirecTV.  And what's the other one? 
[00:07:00]  Their competition.  What?  Dish.  And Dish.  Network.  I was, when I was on vacation, I'm in a hotel room, and they have DirecTV.  Yeah.  And people are going to laugh because they got it out there.  But they have one channel that has every single news channel on it as a pip thing.  Well, that's kind of good.  So you see Fox News Channel, CNN, just MSNBC, Bloomberg.  It runs the gamut.  This is probably eight.  That's pretty good.  Eight little TVs on one TV screen. 
[00:07:30]  And then you're like, whoa.  Oh, CNN's doing whatever.  I think it was Michael Jackson shit.  I'm like, oh, I want to see what the latest Michael Jackson shit is.  So then you move the thing over to CNN, and bloop, and it goes full screen.  And then you go back, and you can just check out all the news channels and see who's doing what  and which is interesting enough to check out.  That I want immediately.  That's like future Marty McFly's son walking in going, give me channel 126, 123, 252, you know.  And it could pop on the screen, right?  Of course. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  And it also goes with your scenery window.  Yeah.  That seems to break.  But what a great thing to have.  Yeah.  I mean, this was for news, which is pretty boring, obviously.  But imagine doing it for all the sports channels, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Or entertainment channels or the networks.  I don't know.  You know what?  I'm digging on cable vision, which is what I have.  That's my cable system.  I like that now you hit that goddamn red button on the remote, and a little thing comes up on 
[00:08:30]  the bottom with the weather and shit and any headline kind of things.  You can just hit it instantly and get your weather.  Really?  Right there on the bottom of the screen.  Boink.  And then you just hit it and it goes away.  I don't think our cable in New York City has that.  Ah, it's a good one.  I like that one.  We got the button, though, that just says, you want to watch this show from the beginning?  Oh, yes, I do.  See, that's the shit.  That's about fucking time.  That is the shit.  You don't like it, Danny?  No, because they don't have it on...  First of all, it's not on every channel.  And what they do now... 
[00:09:00]  They're kind of slowly...  They're slowly rolling it out.  Rolling it out.  Which is fine.  But in turn, what that means is that the guide doesn't move over to the next half hour.  So whereas if it was, let's say it was, you know, here, we're in the six o'clock  hour, so let's say it's 6.26.  I want to now see what's on at 6.30.  You could hit your guide button, and everything in the first column was what's on at 6.30.  Well, they don't do that anymore, because now you can watch the show that was just on,  so you end up wasting five minutes as you're searching, looking at what was already on 
[00:09:30]  before you go, oh, shit, I'm supposed to be looking at the next column over.  Oops.  That's annoying.  And, you know, for the 25 or 30 channels where you could actually start the show over,  it's just not worth it to fuck everyone's ass like that.  Well, they'll figure it all out.  No, they won't.  They just gotta figure it all out.  Well, it seems like a good idea, though, because I've been rifling around the channels  and gone, oh, fuck, it started like 20 minutes ago.  They ask you, do you want to see this show from the beginning?  Really?  Oh, yes, I do.  Okay.  Yes, I do.  But for certain channels, like, you know, it's not available on every channel. 
[00:10:00]  No, not yet.  If you want to watch the fucking Dog Whisperer over again, you could do that, but, you know,  shit they actually want to watch.  Look, man.  I watched Sling Blade last night.  Will you stop with the Sling Blade?  I can't help it.  It was on, and I had to watch it.  Gilder.  Can you just have it on Blu-ray?  I still haven't cracked it open yet.  I know.  Enough already.  I can't stop.  I'm addicted to it.  There's a million movies that you can see before you see that one for the 20th time.  Addicted.  Kevin in Virginia.  What's up, Kevin?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[00:10:30]  Wait.  Wait.  Don't go anywhere.  Don't go anywhere.  Oh, today.  This is today's problem?  Now the mouse isn't done.  Is that it, or is it the other mouse?  You know what?  I got to go back to breaking shit.  It's the only way you get things done.  Is it that mouse?  Yeah.  I've tried both mouses, Anthony.  Oh, my.  See, I'm smart like that.  Can you use the keyboard?  I know how to troubleshoot.  I know how to troubleshoot.  I used both mouses just to make sure I had the right mouse in my hand.  Ooh, Danny's doing something.  No, he's not.  He's just making the screen smaller.  Whoa, it did work, though. 
[00:11:00]  Shit.  Kevin.  Kevin.  Hi.  Hey.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  They have that same sports thing set up.  That wasn't supposed to work.  Six channels across on direct TV.  Oh, they do have that.  Yeah, it's kind of nice, because they have it.  When the golf's going on, baseball, you can switch back and forth between,  because they also have the, I think it's like seven channels there in the U.S.  Open and all that, that you can go and watch each event, each golfer on the greens.  Okay. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  It's a nice feature.  Yeah, it's about time that our TVs get to do a little more.  Yeah.  It's about fucking time.  The future.  Almost here.  The future is here.  No, it's not here.  Well, it's kind of here.  Almost here.  It's getting close to being here.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I got to tell you, congrats to Derek Jeter.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Tie in Luke Gehrig's record.  I was too busy watching Obama, see?  I was too busy watching the Yankee games to watch Obama, to tell you the truth. 
[00:12:00]  See, I thought there was nothing else on, so I said, all right, I'll sit and watch this.  The old Yes Network, I'll tell you, they don't give a flying fuck that the president's on.  How about we do this during the break, because it's very distracting.  Thank you.  Oh, my goodness.  See, the old me would have yelled and screamed and punched you in the face.  Wow.  I just need a little space.  Where did that old you go?  Thank you, Mars.  Jesus.  I love the people that think this is real easy, what we do.  No, it takes a lot of focus and concentration.  You can't just be fiddling around my ears.  Sitting in Opie's lap, working the fucking mouse. 
[00:12:30]  Come on.  Wow, that would have been a beating for somebody five years ago.  Yeah, well.  Anyway, so Jeter finally did it?  Jeter tied the record.  Unfortunately, he didn't pass the record and set it, which I don't think he's going to  be doing in Yankee Stadium, which would have been really cool, because it was exciting  to watch, you know?  It's kind of cool to see a big record like that.  I mean, you're talking fucking Lou Gehrig.  It's his record.  What was that, the 30s or some shit?  Wait, besides inventing a disease, he was good at playing baseball? 
[00:13:00]  Yes, he apparently had a lot of hits, is what he did.  He hit the ball a lot.  But, and Derek Jeter, doing the same.  So, he tied the record last night, and it was very exciting to watch.  Every time he got up at bat, every foul ball, the crowd just went bullshit yelling.  You saw all the flashes going off from the cameras, and he finally did it.  He had a bunt, and then he had a little single. 
[00:13:30]  He blooped in there, the right field.  And, yeah, it was kind of cool.  Were you ever at a baseball game where something really huge happened?  Let me think.  Well, I was at a Yankee World Series, like, the game where they won the World Series.  That's a biggie.  That was a biggie.  Although the record ones are a little bigger.  Yeah.  I was.  It was the Subway Series.  Who are you?  Oh, it's Travis. 
[00:14:00]  Well, disembodied voice.  Hello, disembodied.  Hi.  It's Jambi.  Jambi.  I was at the game when Ripken broke the streak.  Oh, really?  When he didn't show up for work?  Oh, fun.  No, when he did show up for work a lot.  Oh, I thought it was for the one time where he finally didn't show up for work.  I was actually at that game, too.  Because Kevin Costner might have been doing something at his house.  No, that's not true.  And, boy, did we ask him about that.  I didn't know.  And we haven't been able to talk to him since.  So embarrassing. 
[00:14:30]  Travis, you just blew up my spot.  Thanks so much.  Oh, Jiminy.  Because I was leading to the â€“ oh, no, go ahead.  So you were at the game?  No, I shouldn't have a mic in here.  No, it's all right.  It's all right.  Mine's a little different.  And it's not even that â€“ yours is way better.  That's all.  Oh, mine's the best.  You can't beat that.  Yeah, that's cool.  I was at Shea when Pete Rose did that consecutive hit streak thing, beating the National League record.  How old are you?  I was suckling off my mom's boobie.  But she told me I was there, yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah?  What year was that?  What the fuck is â€“  What year did Pete Rose break the National League record for consecutive games with a hit?  If Mad Dog was here, he would know.  Of course he would.  Off the top of his head, that lunatic.  I don't even want to know the year.  I think that might be pushing the 70s.  Someone's saying 82.  82?  Now I'm getting 78.  Oh.  See, people just throw â€“ they just throw things out there.  78 might be a little more accurate.  Yeah, it was 78. 
[00:15:30]  It was 78.  So I was eight.  I was there for Reggie's three home runs.  And I was there when â€“ I was watching a game in the Negro League.  Really?  Yeah, it was amazing.  Pumpsy Green before they â€“  Pumpsy Green.  Before they did the right thing and bring Pumpsy Green up?  When they brought Pumpsy Green on board.  So Jeter did it.  That's awesome.  Yeah, Jeter did it.  It was really cool.  Very exciting.  And then the Yankees go on to win the game also. 
[00:16:00]  They were two runs down.  And goddamn Jorge Posada, who is just a clutch hitter, as they say.  That motherfucker can just step up and really win the game for the team.  He's done it quite a few times.  People are saying that Jeter will be at home to break the record.  Why is that?  I know they're off tonight, but then aren't they away?  Let's say hi to Sage. 
[00:16:30]  Is that your name?  Hey, what's up, Sage?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Good evening.  Good evening, Sage.  They're playing at home Friday, Saturday, I believe, Baltimore.  I think they're away.  Are they home?  Yeah, they're at Yankee Stadium.  Are they?  Yeah, they're playing Baltimore.  Jiminy Cricket.  So why don't you get a ticket for the game?  I should.  Why don't you leave your house and go to a Yankee game?  Give me a ticket to the game.  Because I have better seats in my house, to tell you the truth, for the game than I would  at the stadium.  My whole age thing just backfired on me.  Did it?  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, Opie was eight and sucking on his mom's teat. 
[00:17:00]  Nice.  I dropped my age, but not enough.  Yeah.  After saying that I was sucking on my mom's teat.  Doesn't quite work.  Oopsie.  Although someone on my dumb YouTube channel sent me a video of an eight-year-old breastfeeding.  Ew.  An eight-year-old breastfeeding.  Isn't that like...  I got to post that.  I've been lazy.  Is that legal?  It sounds like kiddie porn.  Well, it was in another country, so I guess it is.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Here's Jeter tying Gerg's record. 
[00:17:30]  It's John Sterling.  Let's see.  Oh, well.  Let's see if he does the right thing here and let the moment be the moment.  Let it be Jeter's moment and not a moment for him to say something stupid.  We'll rate this one.  The pitch.  Hit on the ground.  Base hit.  Right field.  Toward the line.  Fielded by Gross and he fires in.  And Jeter has now tied Lou Gehrig at 2,721 hits.  He's tied a clean single to right between the first baseman, Richard, and the line. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  All right.  That call should have been pumped up a little bit.  Yeah.  He actually was a little lackadaisical on that one.  He's a very confused sports announcer.  He's an idiot.  Because that should have been a lot of excitement instead of like the Yankee, him screaming,  the Yankees win when they win 11-2.  That's a big moment right there.  Where was fucking, what's her face?  Goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  I can't believe Derek Jeter. 
[00:18:30]  He got a single and tied the record.  Passada's in the dugout playing Cat's Cradle with Mo.  At this point, what does she do?  Just get the guy's coffee?  I have no idea what she does.  I never hear her voice.  You don't really hear her anymore.  She did chime in after that, but she wasn't all, you know, going crazy.  I mean, you know, she was calling it, but she wasn't over the top, so I didn't call her.  They must have told her, just shut, don't calm the fuck down. 
[00:19:00]  But you got to defend Susan Wallman.  Why?  At the time, she was very excited about Clemens.  But that's such a stupid thing.  Coming back to the Yankees.  It was a surprise for everybody at the stadium.  She got caught up in the moment.  And maybe she went a little too far, but it's obvious they sat her down and basically, you know.  Yeah, totally calmed down.  Pistol whipped her and said, you'll never do that again.  And then they allow Sterling with his dumb home run calls.  It doesn't make sense.  That's true.  They allow him to do stupid home run calls.  She can't say anything now because she lost her fucking mind when Clemens was out. 
[00:19:30]  Who cares?  Speaking of you.  There's no doubt who's going to be in that spot.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  That voice.  How unsexy is that?  Oh, you're hitting my G-spot.  My G-spot.  Ugh.  Terrible.  You're missing the obvious point, though.  Yeah.  She's a hardcore Yankee fan with a horrendous Boston accent.  Boston accent.  I know.  Yeah.  That's like sacrilege.  It is.  You got to, like, fix that accent if you're going to be a Yankee fan.  Yeah, it really does seem out of place. 
[00:20:00]  You can't have that hardcore Boston accent and root for the Yankees ever.  You just want to say, go Sox.  Go Sox.  Go Sox.  Who actually, yeah, they won last night, too.  It doesn't matter.  You guys don't really need any more wins, right?  No.  The more wins, the more gooder is what it is.  Why?  Save some wins.  No.  That has hurt teams in the past.  More wins, more gooder.  They win too much, and then in the playoffs, they don't have enough wins.  They're on a tear.  The chemistry is there.  That fucking, you feel like you're watching the Yankees of, like, the, you know, late 
[00:20:30]  90s Yankees.  Yeah.  That kind of young, spirited team.  You know?  It's kind of fun to watch again.  They got, you know, Girardi.  I wasn't really a fan at first.  Do you see what I'm wearing today?  A New York Islanders shirt.  So stop talking baseball.  Ew.  Hey, look, man.  We're the best team in hockey right now.  The season hasn't begun.  Apparently.  We're as good as every other fucking team.  Just as good.  That's why I get my Islander fucking t-shirt wearing in before the season starts. 
[00:21:00]  You're tied for first.  By November, it's an embarrassment to wear an Islander t-shirt.  Yeah, you wouldn't wear that.  So stop with the baseball talk.  I've moved on to the next sport already.  Very excited about this year's Yankees.  Very excited.  Nah, they got a really good shot to go all the way.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie.  An eight-year-old breastfeeding or an eight-year-old being breastfed?  Did I say that possibly wrong?  That could be.  It was actually an eight-year-old breastfeeding.  It goes.  It's the same.  People think too much, I think. 
[00:21:30]  God, man.  I would love to yank some of these people into the studio at this time and see how well they  could get something going.  Sit down and sound like you have any bit of energy, you bastards.  I've officially been awake for just over an hour.  Yeah.  I got this waking up and coming to work thing down to a fucking science.  I'm brushing my teeth now in Kenny's car, spitting in a plastic cup.  I hit a landmark last night with the sleep habits of this morning show. 
[00:22:00]  Hit a new landmark.  You never went to bed?  Didn't go to sleep.  Was up.  Actually, got home, went right to bed, woke up sometime around seven at night.  Jesus.  Stayed up from seven until I drove in this morning.  So I haven't been asleep since seven o'clock last night.  I don't know how you do it.  And now I'll get home today, be fucking exhausted, probably do the same thing again.  Because now I'm kind of in night person mode. 
[00:22:30]  I kind of like being up in the wee little hours in the morning and shit.  It's kind of fun.  I can't sleep during the day because I feel like I'm missing something.  Roam around the house, I peek out the windows.  What was that?  What was that?  I saw a shadow.  Semi-nude.  Really?  Outside your house?  Teasing, of course.  That's pretty nice.  No.  No, if I sleep during the day, I feel like I'm missing something.  Yeah, I usually do too, but the weather kind of sucked.  It forces me up.  Like, I will have a good sleep going on.  Yeah.  And then I'll wake up like, I'm missing something!  Yeah, it's something going on. 
[00:23:00]  And then you realize there's nothing going on.  Exactly, because then I do get up and wander my neighborhood and go, yeah, I probably should  just keep sleeping.  Yeah, it's just, I should have slept.  You're right.  Because I'll wake up sometimes and look out the window and go, eh, this looks like a pretty  decent day.  Right.  And then I'll get up and maybe go out back for a little while and go, there's no one  here.  I'm just kidding.  What am I going to do?  Frolic alone in the pool?  Or kind of, you know.  That's not bad.  No, it's, believe me, it's cool when it's 90 degrees out.  You could shoot jizz everywhere.  I just do. 
[00:23:30]  I'm like a fucking sprinkler.  I'm like a yogurt sprinkler.  It's fun.  You can make your own jizz fountain in the middle of your pool.  When it's 90 degrees out, but lately it hasn't been all that warm, so it's like not kind  of a hangout, you know, outside kind of thing.  In the fall, I'm looking forward to, you know, the fire pit area.  Oh, you do have a fire pit.  Throwing some logs in there and shit and hanging out down there.  Yeah.  But it's sort of a weird transitional period where it's like, I got nothing to really go outside  or hang out for.  So I'm going to sleep.  I'll wake up at night, watch some TV, hang out. 
[00:24:00]  And that's it.  Fuck around.  Whatever.  Here's Jorge hitting his home run yesterday.  Jorge.  Oh, wow.  It'll be a 3-2 to Posada from Balfour, the right-hander.  Heston, the tying runoff third.  Swisher, the go-ahead runoff first.  One out.  Bottom of the eighth.  Two on Tampa Bay.  Pitch.  Swung on and drilled to right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Jorge Posada just drilled a 3-2 pitch into the right-field seats. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, Georgie Juswan, a three-run blast.  And the Yankees take a 4-2 lead.  That, oh, you know it's coming.  He does the call and it's fine.  And then once you hear that, oh, you go, oh, here it comes.  Georgie Juswan, did he?  He knows people hate it, so the, oh, is your cue to hit mute?  To, like, you're just, you're fucking lunging toward your dashboard.  You're lunging toward your dashboard trying to hit any fucking button. 
[00:25:00]  Oh!  A lot of listeners sending me other sports announcers, but no one comes close to the John Sterling calls.  I'm telling you.  Can't be that douchey.  There might be a few worth playing.  I might bring to the show tomorrow.  But in general, no.  Sterling takes the cake, as they say.  So, this Obama thing.  Are we going to get people pissed off today, Ant?  When we talk politics, man, they get riled up out there.  They do.  I can't be bothered with this shit.  The phones light up, but you know something? 
[00:25:30]  I don't have the energy right now to start yelling.  Okay, that's good.  He had his speech last night about health care, the much-trumpeted speech that everybody knew was coming.  And it's the same thing.  He didn't change anyone's fucking minds.  It's the same people that didn't want it don't want it.  The same people that wanted it still want it.  And that's it.  He got some face time.  I don't see anything changing.  I don't see this passing. 
[00:26:00]  Well, he said there's a lot of work still to be done.  Oh, is there?  How come he wanted it fucking passed?  You know something?  A lot of work to be done.  He wanted this thing passed like a month ago.  So, what happened a month ago that was different where he wanted it passed and now there's work to be done?  So, you're saying he wanted a bill that wasn't good and wasn't ready to be passed a month ago?  Well.  Liar!  Liar.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying when a Republican yelled liar. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, apparently somebody was a little annoyed.  Well, the two highlights, it's almost not worth playing some, I guess we'll play a few clips here, but the two highlights, he said there's a lot of work still to be done and a bunch of Republicans, you know, started kind of laughing at him.  Yeah.  And pretty loud.  Yeah.  It stopped the speech a little bit.  Because it's like, how could you say there's a lot of work to be done when he wanted this bill passed a month ago?  They basically were saying, no shit, there's a lot of work to be done.  Yeah, a lot of work to be done.  Oh, well, thanks for letting us know. 
[00:27:00]  Uh, oh, okay.  Wait, this doesn't, hold on.  Oh, Jesus, E-Rock.  Oh, my dear sweet E-Rock.  Oh, my, my.  Hold on.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  E to the R.  I want to throw my hat in the ring.  I think I could do a good Bobo.  I know Danny does a good Bobo.  Danny does a really good Bobo.  I'm not lying.  Wow.  I'm not lying.  That's a good one.  It's up there.  I'm not lying. 
[00:27:30]  I'm not lying.  Lying.  I'm not lying.  My sister.  Cole fucking Kane.  That's a good one, too.  Cole fucking Kane.  See, I can do voices.  That's really fucking robust, though.  His or mine?  His.  All right, give me 20 more minutes to wake up.  Cole fucking Kane.  Cole fucking Kane.  It's Kane.  Kane.  Kane.  Yeah.  Kane.  So I can do voices as long as it's like less than 10 words.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  I'm not lying.  Here's Obama talking about his thing.  His thing.  This is what he's going to be known for, I guess.  Yeah.  Or he's going to attempt.  Uh-huh.  First.  Oh, I got another theory.  First.  I got another theory.  Watch.  This is going to sound crazy.  I know.  Hillary Clinton, vice president for the second term if Obama makes it.  Thank you.  You heard it here first.  Mark the day.  Mark your tapes.  That is a lame-ass ticket because, uh... 
[00:28:30]  They're hugging.  They were hugging last night.  Oh, they're the best of pals.  They used to hate each other, but there's something going on.  Like, there's been some conversations behind the scenes.  Well, because they're both looking at each other going, can you fucking believe we don't  know what we're doing and we have these jobs?  I'm the secretary of fucking state and I don't have a clue.  Joe Biden doesn't make a second term.  I'm telling you right now.  And I'm very suspicious of this Hillary and Obama kind of getting a bit too friendly because  they did not like each other.  They were warriors during the campaign. 
[00:29:00]  This is kind of a grooming process for Hillary.  I could see that.  The secretary of state.  She kind of gets a lot of time.  People are seeing her.  She's getting a little bit of expertise on foreign affairs, even though I don't know what  the fuck she does.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not saying that she...  How about you go to Afghanistan?  I don't know if she would make a good vice president, but I mean, what does the vice president  really do anyway?  You go to state funerals and stuff.  Yeah.  And if the president's having a beer, you just kind of hang out because it's, you know,  it's a cool hang.  It's a thing to do.  I really don't know what Biden does. 
[00:29:30]  He gives speeches.  And he's a loose cannon.  And he says stupid things.  He will say something so stupid they got to, like, just hide him for two years and  then bring a new person in.  Maybe that's why he's brought in, Obama's brought in all these moronic czars that trip  over their own dicks when they're talking to make Biden not look so bad when he talks.  So he brings in these radicals and they talk and people go, holy shit, this guy's a lunatic.  Get him out.  And they throw him out.  And then Biden says something stupid.  You go, yeah, but compared to that other guy, that ain't shit.  But it's good when you can be the person where people just go, ah, yeah, it's Biden. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, it's Biden.  That's all right.  Ah, don't worry about it.  But if he said it on the radio, he'd be fired.  Yeah, fired.  It's ridiculous.  First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance  through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require  you or your employer to change the coverage of the doctor you have.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  So I guess that's...  When the hell did this happen?  And why wasn't I told?  I guess that's all the Democrats clapping.  Yeah.  See, that's the problem with this whole country, but they don't even want to work together.  Now, initially, though, he wanted just a government plan.  Then, he did not really want you to be able to keep your current health care provider.  Right.  Because that kind of defeats the purpose. 
[00:31:00]  It's either it's all or nothing kind of a thing.  Right.  And now he's saying, oh, don't worry about it.  Now you could keep your provider.  By the way, you could keep it.  Nothing in this plan, by the way.  You got to listen to what he says.  Nothing in this plan will take away your ability to privately insure yourself or have your company  insure you or something like that.  But there's these triggers that they talk about.  No triggers, you dummy.  Only in your mind, my friend.  There's triggers that they talk about.  Only in your mind.  I heard triggers. 
[00:31:30]  That could kick in and take away that option.  Okay.  There's also maybe, not in this plan, but maybe in a future plan.  You know, this guy's, his whole thing has been to have a national health care system and  privatized health care just doesn't fit into his plan.  So I don't know.  Like, this may be one of the things he's trying to figure out.  I don't know.  Well, he's got to adjust because people are a little outraged by his plan.  People are a little outraged.  They're fucking pissed. 
[00:32:00]  I'm outraged by one thing as far as health insurance goes.  The co-pay.  You don't like that co-pay?  Let's start with getting rid of the dumb co-pay.  I don't like a co-pay.  When you go to a doctor and they take your insurance cards and they copy them, whatever  the fuck they're doing with that.  Every time.  And then all of a sudden they go, okay, that'll be 50 bucks.  And you're like, well, I'm insured.  No, this is the co-pay.  There's a co-pay.  How the fuck did they get that one past us?  And they always just stick in some little tin box.  Oh, yeah.  And write out some receipt like it's fucking the goddamn mercantile from Little House on the Prairie. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, you give that receipt to the tax guy.  He's like, what is this?  What is this?  Where's my co-pay?  I'm like, yeah, keep it yourself.  You're right.  It's money so the office can buy lunch for each other.  Yes, petty cash.  You know, how about you buy your own lunch and give me my fucking co-pay back?  Petty cash.  Petty cash, right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let me repeat this.  Uh-oh. 
[00:33:00]  Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.  What this plan will do is make the insurance you have work better for you.  How does that happen?  Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because  of a pre-existing condition.  And there's the Democrats cheering, cheering, cheering.  And the Republicans, were they just sitting there with their arms folded?  Quite amazing. 
[00:33:30]  I can't help but read between the lines, but I don't know.  I don't know enough yet.  I don't know enough yet about this new thing.  I'm still working off the old health care agenda that he had.  Now, with this speech, I'm going to have to do a little more research.  I'm not going to go off the deep end, Opie.  I'm not going to go crazy today and start yelling.  All right.  Because I have to do a little more research and see what this is about.  Because you're tired.  Exhausted.  Coke Logic writes, go fucking pay. 
[00:34:00]  Coke Logic, right on.  Coke fucking cane.  As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your  coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it the most.  They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you  can receive in a given year or in a lifetime. 
[00:34:30]  Where's he going?  We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses.  Because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick.  All right.  I like that idea.  Where's he going with this?  I like that idea.  Where's he going with this?  It wasn't too long ago that I was poor and paying a lot just to see doctors and shit.  I like what he's saying right there, my friend.  Where's he going with this?  I kind of like that. 
[00:35:00]  I don't get this.  Now, he's saying it'll be illegal for your insurance provider to do certain things.  How about you pick up a prescription and you give your prescription card.  You're covered.  Yeah.  And then the stupid pharmacy tech or whatever they're called goes, oh, that'll be $120.  No, the co-pay.  I'm like, I am insured.  Well, without the insurance, it's $680.  Yeah, yeah.  What is that about?  Co-pay.  Am I insured or not?  Yeah.  And it doesn't matter how much fucking money you make in this world, that still bothers me. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  That chiseling of your money, the chiseling down of your fucking money, am I covered or not?  The drug companies, they really do charge a lot for their drugs.  But you got to think, a lot goes into the research.  Oh, come on, Ant.  You know, a lot goes into the research and development of some of these drugs.  You know, they put billions of dollars into some of these projects and drugs and stuff, and they have to recoup it somehow. 
[00:36:00]  And if you look at it, if they charge a small amount for it, it's going to take them forever to recoup their research.  I don't know.  Seems odd to me.  Maybe some kind of a subsidizing of it.  But then again, you're talking kind of almost socialism there again.  But I have no idea.  I got to read up more.  I got you in a good place right here.  So we're going to continue with the Obama eclipse. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm fine.  You're very calm so far.  I'm calm.  If you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance,  the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices.  If you lose your job or you change your job, you'll be able to get coverage.  If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you'll be able to get coverage.  We'll do this by creating a new insurance exchange, a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. 
[00:37:00]  Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers.  As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage.  This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance.  It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. 
[00:37:30]  And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we give ourselves.  Oh, shit.  God damn.  How are we going to pay for this?  Where's the cash coming from?  I hear it's something like $900 billion this plan is going to cost, which whenever they quote an amount, it's usually take half of it and add it on to the amount.  So you're talking over a trillion dollars.  Sounds good, though.  What are you saying?  Well, you know, I just don't want to hear how we're supposed to pay for this. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know the ins and outs.  Like I said, I was watching the wonderful I was watching another man with a black father and a white mother last night.  Derek Jeter.  That's what I was watching.  I was watching him succeed.  I saw an interracial couple when I was driving from Big Sur to L.A.  Oh, my God.  What'd you do?  Five kids.  What?  The father was as dark as night.  Really?  And the woman looked like she was a white Jewish broad. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  Five kids.  Not one looked like the mother.  Oh, really?  I'm like, wow, that's got to really suck.  Dominant gene.  I would imagine if you have a kid, you kind of want the kid to look a little like you.  A little like you.  Oh, yeah.  And the gene was so dominant and the father was so black that the kids were so black.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Because usually that, you know, you mix a little white squeaks through a little white squeaks  through.  Like Sam.  And you get supermodels.  Like Sam. 
[00:39:00]  Not in this case.  The kids were pretty dark.  And she's ordering food.  I'm like, why would you do that?  They don't look like you.  You've got to be frustrated.  That's got to be sad for her.  She pushed out five babies and not one has any resemblance to her.  She was trying.  You can kind of tell that it's her kids.  Yeah.  But, I mean, barely.  You have to look really close.  Oh, Christ.  I just thought that must suck for her for some reason.  For some reason, I really can't explain. 
[00:39:30]  But it's just.  And everyone's very cordial to the interracial couple.  Yeah.  Even though everyone was like, holy shit, look at this.  This is something you don't see every day.  The hell's going on?  All right.  Obama says it's time to stop bickering.  Oh, no bickering.  And there is agreement in this chamber on about 80% of what needs to be done.  Is that true?  Putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.  No way, no how.  Nope.  Not now, not never.  But what we've also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens 
[00:40:00]  the disdain many Americans have towards their own government.  Oh, out of Pelosi?  Instead of honest debate, we've seen scare tactics.  Mm-hmm.  Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise.  Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short-term political points, even if  it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long-term challenge.  Oh, shit.  And out of this blizzard of charges and counter-charges, confusion has reigned. 
[00:40:30]  Uh-oh.  Well, the time for bickering is over.  The time for games has passed.  Now is the season for action.  Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the American  people that we can still do what we were sent here to do.  Now is the time to deliver on health care.  For America.  For America. 
[00:41:00]  Wow, is he yelling.  Damn.  He had some energy to ride.  He certainly did.  Nothing better than having some energy to ride.  I guess.  When you're talking to people in public.  People aren't really approving of this health care thing in the short-term polls after the  speech.  But I think he made a few points just on the delivery of the speech.  Okay.  Like the content.  People are still liking.  Don't fuck yourself.  So, but as far as how he came across, he came across a lot more presidential than he 
[00:41:30]  has been of late.  Right.  And looking, you know, and having that attitude of, hey, I'm in charge over here.  Sure.  You know?  Well, Barry in Ohio has a very, very good question on instant feedback.  He writes, what's wrong with the health care we got?  Met live.  What's some of those health care providers?  Adnor.  Adnor.  U.S. health care.  Uh, blue cross, blue shield.  Telt it. 
[00:42:00]  Telt it.  It healed pretty good.  It healed pretty good.  And the only other highlight from the speech was this Republican, Joe Wilson.  Where is he from?  South Carolina, I think?  South Carolina.  Is that what I was reading?  Man.  He basically, wow, stood up and said, you lie to Obama.  He didn't really appreciate what Obama was saying, didn't think it was the truth.  This is how it went down.  There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would ensure illegal immigrants. 
[00:42:30]  This, too, is false.  The reforms, the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegal.  And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up.  Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions.  And federal conscience laws will remain in place. 
[00:43:00]  Now.  Damn, I love that.  You know something?  Ooh!  You lie!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Obama, you gonna take that?  What's this world coming to?  You got a set of balls.  I hear this is for you.  This is for you.  That's some set of balls.  Well, good for you.  Let me say hi to Jerry in Cleveland.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Hey, boys. 
[00:43:30]  It's Jeremy.  Hey, Opie.  We're the black family also so poor since they were so black.  Wolf Blitzer.  So black.  Yeah, Wolf Blitzer.  Opie Blitzer over here.  Fuck.  I'd like to observe.  What can I tell you?  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  Whoa! 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  You lie!  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  Yeah.  You know what's a little odd?  Again, I say I have to check into it.  I got to do some reading on this subject.  But what he described as what is not in the bill is pretty much the government saying, 
[00:44:30]  ah, all right, if you need some health care, it'll be available to you.  But everything else is going to remain exactly the same.  So what incentive is that for him to actually get this passed as a federal, something that's any different than is in place now with like Medicaid, Medicare, and legally you can get emergency room service.  But just shit like that, I don't, I think, I think he lied.  I think he lied. 
[00:45:00]  Join my side.  It's just all horse shit.  It's hokum.  I think it's hokum.  It's all horse shit in the end.  Give me a break.  Shenanigans.  Me and Ann were discussing, and we sort of had an agreement this morning, which was nice.  Like, he's not an Obama fan.  I understand that.  I was sort of an Obama fan during the election because I really thought for once, holy shit, we might be able to fucking change this system.  I'm all about changing the system in general.  Acknowledging the Constitution, obviously.  Well, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  And it's very obvious as the days and months go on, it's just a new boss, same as the old boss.  Yeah.  And I was telling Anthony, yeah, I don't like paying all these taxes.  No one really likes paying taxes.  Pay it.  It doesn't matter how much money you make.  When you see that half your money is going to the government, actually it's more than half now, right?  Yeah, more than half.  Officially.  When you really think about it, when they tax it federally, state-wise, and then the money that you're left with is taxed every time you buy something.  Oh, you're paying way over 50%. 
[00:46:00]  And now they want to try to get a soda tax going and other taxes going.  And I'm like, all right, Ant, so you're not an Obama guy.  So let's say he's a bust and four years from now a Republican comes in and lowers our taxes slightly.  We're still paying way the fuck too many taxes no matter who the fuck is in there.  And that's what drives me more nuts than if it's a Democrat or a Republican.  End of conversation.  They'll never lower them more than the last guy raised them.  Right, and I told Anthony that basically the Democrats are doing the dirty work of the Republican. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  They raised the taxes a little bit.  Republican gets in there and squeezes it back down a little bit.  But you're still paying way too many taxes in the end.  Yeah.  So I'm supposed to get excited.  Like Hannity and all these people like, come on, hope you're not.  It's all right.  All right, I'll join your team.  All right, we get a young Republican in there and he lowers the taxes slightly.  What does it matter?  What does it matter if it's 54% or 52%?  We're still paying way too many fucking taxes in this country. 
[00:47:00]  It's just too much.  How do we solve that?  I have more of a problem with who's being taxed.  Well, no, actually how much is being taxed I have a huge problem with.  But who's being taxed is really bad too.  I mean there's so many people that just aren't paying any tax.  Yeah, I understand all that and that's bullshit too.  Fess.  But okay, does the Republican turn that all around in the end?  Turns it around slightly?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, a little bit.  But how do we solve that problem? 
[00:47:30]  Do we get a third party in there to, you know, knock off the balance a little bit?  I don't know, with Obama being in there, if people aren't satisfied and they still got  this recollection of the right-wing religious right of George W., a third party might have  a little bit more of a chance because people are disgusted with the other two parties, which  is kind of, you know, creepy to think that the only way a third party actually gets in  is when people get so completely disgusted with the two choices that have been shoved down 
[00:48:00]  our throats forever.  How about a third party that's like just made up of robots?  Those kickover, that you can't kick over?  Oh, the fucking can't kick over robots from yesterday's show?  I'd listen to that motherfucker if he was talking about healthcare.  Yeah.  You can't knock him over.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's sort of where I'm at with that.  Spandyman, stop fucking spamming.  What is that about?  I'm just, I'm trying to read feedback here and this idiot is... 
[00:48:30]  No, I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I think you're lying.  I swear I'll fucking bounce that motherfucker.  Enough.  Stop it.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  All right.  I think Blue Healer's a little jealous because Coke Logic got a good line in.  So Blue Healer's back here with this one.  You got to start voting, Opie.  Otherwise, it's just words.  Man!  Man, you know, you don't have a right to say anything if you didn't vote. 
[00:49:00]  I guess I'm a libertarian, huh?  Yeah.  Less government and all that shit.  That's it.  I think everybody is a libertarian unless you're a radical right-wing zealot or a left-wing bedwetting liberal.  Well, everyone pretty much falls into more of a libertarian category because you don't want the government up your ass, but you want the potholes filled.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Fill the fucking potholes in the street and stay out of my pockets and let me do what I want to do for the most part. 
[00:49:30]  We have a major problem in this country because there's not â€“ well, the majority of the people in America don't have any leeway.  They have to work their fucking balls off hoping that they don't get fired or hope they don't get sick.  Yeah.  There's no leeway if you do lose your job or you get sick where you're like, all right, I'm okay for the next â€“  No, you have no time.  No time.  And there was a time probably â€“  Where you had some time.  Where you had some time.  Probably when our parents were growing up, you didn't have to have both mommy and daddy working just to pay the bills. 
[00:50:00]  The mommies aren't working because they want to make something of themselves.  Most mommies are working because they have to fucking help pay the bills because the bills are strangling everybody.  If Pop got laid off, she'd go to the old cookie jar and go, well, we got the money for a rainy day, and I guess it's a rainy day.  For real.  You know, just in my family, I'm one of a lot.  You know, I got a few siblings that are in a bit of trouble.  Yeah.  And they work hard.  They're not like lazy motherfuckers. 
[00:50:30]  They're working hard, and they've had a couple bad breaks.  They don't have money to pay their bills.  Oh.  That's bullshit in America.  And that's no matter who's in office.  That's what I'm saying, Anthony.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  That's it.  The Republican isn't going to give the average American leeway.  The Democrats certainly isn't either.  I'm not, you know, trashing Republicans.  I'm trashing both parties.  You're right.  I'm not a bandwagon jumper on the right and on the Republican side with every issue. 
[00:51:00]  I think you're absolutely right.  There's no leeway for anybody.  Too much tax.  Too much government up our ass.  But I think, without trying to sound like a conspiracy guy, it's in the best interest of the people in charge in power, the government, to keep people in that situation where they're so preoccupied by having to survive and exist that they really can't put a lot of energy and thought into what the government's doing that pisses them off. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  Because, you know, a lot of people have said it.  Why don't, you know, why does the average Joe get out there and start protesting?  Well, they've got to go to work in the morning.  They've got, that's the ideal situation for a government is having a populace that is so busy just trying to fucking breathe and eat.  You're scared to take a day off from work.  So you can't, you can't really do anything.  You can't gather up an organization or people, because usually the people that have organizations are those nuts on the left and the right.  Right.  But the middle people, the ones that, you know, I believe are more libertarian, they're so afraid of not working a day that they can't really get together and discuss things at length about the government and maybe changing things. 
[00:52:00]  So, you know, it happens in another four years goes by, some other guy gets in there.  Most families can't even take a vacation.  Remember when you, remember when you were growing up, you took a vacation and it was basically no sweat.  Like you said, you had money for a rainy day.  I grew up poor.  A lot.  I mean, real fucking poor.  But we still were able to take a vacation because that was reasonable. 
[00:52:30]  Now slept on a sandy cot.  All that shit.  For the love of God.  You've heard all the dumb stories.  Of course.  But also we did have enough money to go on vacation.  Now, I hear from my, I listen to my family and they go to Disney or something and it's like they're sweating the whole time they're in Disney going, how the fuck are we going to pay for this?  Yeah.  I know Disney's is like the vacation thing, but there's other vacation spots that are costing an arm and a leg now.  Yeah.  And you're supposed to take that time to relax from your job. 
[00:53:00]  You're not relaxing because you're like, holy shit, these are more fucking bills.  How are we going to pay these bills now?  And that is the worst thing.  When you get home from vacation and crack open that mailbox and just go, oh, fuck, there they are.  All the bills back to business as usual.  Yeah.  It's frightening.  Obama's a fucking socialist.  Well, we know that.  Man, 58 cents of every dollar you spend is tax.  That is just, that's how, that's why we left.  Yeah.  England.  And that's, that's why we, we left that it was the taxes, the, well, other things too. 
[00:53:30]  How much were the, religious freedom and stuff like that.  I know, I know I'm simplifying it, but the one point I want to make, I would love to know what the taxes were that got us so outraged.  We're like, we got to get on some fucking boats.  Probably nothing.  It was probably like 15%.  It was probably nothing.  Actually, it probably wasn't even 15%.  1%.  I would love to know what that is.  If anyone really knows their history.  We shan't take this anymore.  If they could come up with that one for us, that would be nice.  We're leaving.  What was the percentage that we were paying that, the outrage is to the point we got to move on. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, just fucking said, screw you.  Yeah, the religious thing was.  We're taking America and you could go fuck yourself.  Well, we discovered it, even though there are people here.  It's not your colony anymore.  It's our country.  People were already here, but we discovered it, you know.  Yeah.  Well, the people that were here were savages.  What were they going to do with it?  Didn't even have a wheel.  I love a Pete.  I love that.  You can't discover something that.  I discovered America.  America, what are these things? 
[00:54:30]  There's thousands and thousands of people there.  They discovered it.  There's some people here, but they don't look like us.  Slaughter them!  Right.  That's Jesus.  That was the early days.  That was part of the game.  I hear you.  Like a big video game back then.  All right.  Happy birthday to Arnold Palmer, 80 years old.  Arnold Palmer is 80.  The golfer.  The golfing great.  Yes.  I just saw that real fast.  36 days until Fur Fright, 2009.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I remember.  It just seems like it was just like 47 days. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was yesterday.  Time flies.  Okay.  Here we go.  So we're going to take a break, get into some other things.  Big announcement from Ellen DeGeneres.  I want to know a little bit about Steve Jobs.  Going back to Dick?  No?  No.  Ah.  No.  I want to know what Steve Jobs' issue was.  Because everyone said it was pancreatic cancer.  We're finding out something different today.  Ooh.  And Apple announced what?  New iPhones and iPods and iTunes.  Well, they're trying to.  Yeah.  After the break, we'll talk about that and other things. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  Jay-Z interviewed by our old station.  We didn't forget about that.  Oh, we never got to that, huh?  We got Tyra Banks doing a period show.  Not the punctuation, mind you.  Ooh.  The fun, good period to talk about.  Oh, my God.  What?  If this guy knows anything about history, you're not going to believe this one.  Keith in Jersey.  Keith.  How you doing, O?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  It was a 3% increase in income tax. 
[00:56:00]  So what was the overall percentage then?  Wasn't it really?  It was only 3%.  It went from 0% to 3%?  Well, there were some taxes.  They didn't have an income tax like we have it now.  Right.  There were some taxes obviously levied against goods, and it was a 3% increase.  Increase.  Okay, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Imagine that.  There's the answer.  I think it was the Stamp Act of 1765 that got everybody riled. 
[00:56:30]  3%.  The Stamp Tax.  Can we go back in time and go, all right, we'll take it.  We'll take this deal.  Yeah, we'll take it.  3% increase.  Good.  Fine.  3%.  Everyone started rioting.  Unbelievable.  Thank you, Keith.  But now we're well over 50%, and no one's rioting.  Because Anthony, and I've said this a million times on the show, I understand, but it's worth repeating.  Anthony's take on taxes is brilliant.  It really is.  It's always been that way. 
[00:57:00]  With the slow boil.  The slow burn where we just took it for so many years because it was incremental, very slight.  You're just slowly turning up the heat as you go.  But if one day.  And if you're in that water, you're really not noticing that the water's getting hotter and hotter and hotter.  You don't notice it.  But, man, if they just told you in one day you went from paying, you know, 3% tax or something and go, okay, tomorrow, everyone, we're taking half your money.  That's like throwing you into a boiling pot of water.  It'd be a revolution.  You would notice right away. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, that would get your attention.  There'd be a riot.  But somehow, over the years, they were able to achieve this without the country saying, hey, revolution.  Amazing.  You think we'll be around to see the whole collapse?  Please, Jesus.  Please let me be around for that.  Because eventually they're going to run out of, you know, ways to get more money from us.  Only if it includes zombies.  Zombies.  I want zombies, too.  What about the robots that don't fall over? 
[00:58:00]  Those two.  Robots and zombies.  Yeah.  I don't think there's ever been a combination robot-zombie movie, has there?  Danny would know.  Hey, what's that Zombieland or Zombietown?  What movie is that?  Yeah, Zombieland.  Now, what is that about?  It seems, it looks to me.  It looks like it's almost like a Disney for people.  Like, if you want to hunt zombies, you go there and you get, like, almost Westworld.  Remember Westworld?  No.  You were in a Western?  I did see the trailer and it kind of just looked kind of like a Shaun of the Dead-ish style 
[00:58:30]  zombies.  Yeah.  Like, where, you know, there's total apocalypse and there's zombies running around and, you  know, Woody Harrelson and his friend running around trying to just survive day to day.  To me, it looked almost like an amusement park atmosphere where you get to hunt zombies.  It's like they've kind of got them in this area.  I don't know.  But if that isn't the plot of the movie, don't steal it.  I'm taking it.  Is it?  There you go.  It's my movie.  Copyrighted immediately.  It's my movie.  Is it a takeoff on, like, big game hunting where you pay a fee and then you kind of... 
[00:59:00]  That was the impression I kind of got from the trailer.  You hunt within the confines of this area?  And then, you know, of course, some people get fucked up and everything, but I don't  know.  I don't know.  And then the zombies cut a hole in the fence and then they're in the real world and then  we have a real problem.  Horror comedy from the men who found a way to survive in a world overrun by zombies.  All right.  So it's a world overrun by zombies.  All right.  Nothing new there.  Yeah.  We've seen that movie a million times.  I'm making a movie, by the way, where you get to go to an amusement park and kill zombies. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  Our first break is upon us here.  Oh, it is.  Look at the time.  And Jay-Z, very upset about his concert he's doing tomorrow.  Very upset.  Yes, yes, he is.  So we got lots to do.  Opie and Anthony today.  Who's coming in?  I think Jim Jefferies a little later.  Jim Jefferies coming in.  Nice.  Yeah.  I think he's playing Caroline.  Right.  Yeah.  I think.  I'll get the info after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Titty Mountain Highway. 
[01:00:00]  Is that stuck in your head yesterday?  No.  Titty Mountain Highway.  Thank God I got that out of my head pretty quick.  Lickety split.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hola.  Jay-Z, very pissed off.  You don't want to piss off Jay-Z.  Why?  Is he like gangster?  He's like a mogul.  A media mogul.  Oh.  But he won't like, you know, he won't shoot up your shit or nothing, right?  He's not that kind of guy?  But I mean.  Too much to lose.  Sam, Sam, you know a lot about the hip hop community. 
[01:00:30]  He's not stupid.  A lot of his guys do all that stuff.  Yeah.  You're not going to see Jay-Z's finger on the trigger.  But things happen.  Oh, there's a lesbian action going on on Channel 11.  Wow.  Nice.  All right.  That'll get the ratings up.  What the hell are they doing?  I don't know.  Um, well, Jay-Z, someone's got to talk to him, son.  Yeah.  He puts a concert together at Madison Square Garden that's happening tomorrow night, the  ninth, we're up to nine years since 9-11, right? 
[01:01:00]  So he's honoring that for the concert at Madison Square Garden.  Isn't it nine?  No.  Nine?  Nine?  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Eight years.  Yeah, eight years.  Plus the blueprint.  His album came out on 9-11-01, and the blueprint three came out.  This week, so he's, why fucking, you know something, that's a little, that's a little  opportunistic.  The blueprint?  He's, first of all, maybe the greatest rap, if not album in general ever made. 
[01:01:30]  Is that the one with 99 problems, but the bitch ain't won?  Of course it's not.  Why?  Of course it's not.  That song rocks.  That's the only Jay-Z song I know.  It's on, that song is on the Black Album, which is another untouchably good album.  Black Album?  The Black Album.  Metallica's in the Black Album.  No, Jay-Z's album, the Black Album.  You know, what the fuck is with this guy?  Which is better than Metallica's Black Album.  I don't fucking know.  Now you better sit the fuck down right now.  That's what I just said.  You better relax.  Maybe you can just stop right now.  And Spinal Tap had a Black Album. 
[01:02:00]  Well, Jay-Z's is better than that, too.  Simple, black.  What was the big hit off that album?  Um, I would say Big Bottom.  Yeah, of course, Big Bottom.  Was the big one.  Yeah.  Big Bottom.  Although, Sex Farm was good, too.  Sex Farm was, uh...  Spinal Tap's version of Sex Farm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam.  Yeah.  So, Jay-Z's doing this concert at Madison Square Garden to honor, you know, the victims of 9-11.  All for charity.  All for charity.  It's been eight years.  The thought is, it is wonderful. 
[01:02:30]  I'm not going to argue about that.  But he's surprised that everyone bought the tickets and are now scalping them for thousands  because he's a big get.  People want to see Jay-Z.  But now he's pissed off that everyone's selling the tickets that were supposed to be, what,  free or something?  Well, there was some kind of chicanery because they were supposed to be $55 a ticket, but  nobody could get them.  Like, they were not, they were impossible to get.  Why couldn't they get them?  They were not, like, I tried to, everybody I know who tried to get them, the second they  went on sale, they were impossible. 
[01:03:00]  We don't know the scalpers and whatnot get first, you know, dibs at all those seats now.  That's not a right thing.  It's been happening.  I know.  Another thing that's wrong with this world of ours.  Yeah.  We all know that.  So, why is he on TV today surprised that this is happening?  Well, I think he was hoping that at least some fans would get the opportunity to get  tickets before scalpers did.  So, now he's going to be playing in front of people that really like him but don't really  give a shit why he's doing the concert.  Right.  I know.  And he's doing a free concert right when his album's being released? 
[01:03:30]  Well, I mean, it all comes together.  But the concert tickets and the merchandise and the food and everything goes to 9-11 charities.  All right.  All right.  I mean, that's cool and everything.  You can't pitch about that.  It's a little opportunistic, I think.  Well, he's got to get something out of it.  It reeks a little bit of, just how about getting something out of it like you're doing something  to commemorate a tragic event.  I agree with you.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I actually agree with you. 
[01:04:00]  But it also is because he put out one of his most famous albums, happened to come out  on 9-11-01.  So?  Oh, what does it have to come out on the same fucking date?  Yeah.  And this is the Blueprint 3 that just came out.  Yeah.  So Blueprint 1, Blueprint 3.  Blueprint 3.  What about Blueprint 2?  The Gift and the Curse?  Did that have 99 Problems But The Bitch Ain't Won?  No, I said that was on the Black Album.  Oh.  Black Album?  Not Metallica had that.  No, Jay-Z.  Wherever I may rule. 
[01:04:30]  Can I hear a little 99 Problems But The Bitch Ain't Won?  Of course you can.  Yeah, let's get a little over.  This almost got me into hip-hop.  But The Bitch Ain't Won!  Oh, they bleeped the bitch part?  What?  What pussy shit is that?  Yo.  This song almost pulled me in, Sam.  I was almost all in after this.  This really did win the rock crowd over.  They were playing this on K-Rock.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah! 
[01:05:00]  This song's, what, two years old now?  Way more than two years old.  Come on, give me the hook one more time.  Come on.  I'm all about the hook.  I got a whole iPod filled with hooks.  I don't need the rest of the songs.  The verses are good, too.  Bitch ain't won!  Oh, yeah.  Another word.  I love that part.  Hit me!  All right, Chavs.  Thank you.  So, Ann makes a very... 
[01:05:30]  Ann makes a good point.  I did?  Jay-Z is using this as an opportunity to promote himself because he's got a new CD dropping.  Blueprint 3.  It dropped.  It dropped, okay.  It was supposed to drop on 9-11, but they upped the release date.  But it brings a lot of attention to his latest work.  Sure.  Yeah, it does.  And he's doing this concert, and he's mad that other people are seeing this as an opportunity  to better themselves by putting a little extra cash in their pockets.  And he's kind of using it as an opportunity to promote an album that he has out because,  I mean, what better way to get the nation's attention on your album than having a free concert 
[01:06:00]  for, you know, one of these big charitable events kind of a thing?  Yeah, but people are...  The scalpers are trying to sell these $50 tickets for like $3,000.  Well, welcome to the white world.  Exactly.  That's what's going on with all our fucking rock bands.  That's right.  You can't get a good seat for a show unless you've got a lot of money now.  No!  A lot of money.  I don't have tickets for this concert.  No one's going to get tickets for this.  It's going to be loaded with people that have a lot of money, and that's about it. 
[01:06:30]  A lot of dirty money, Sam.  I wouldn't go anyway.  I don't like that kind of money.  A lot of dirty money.  That's not being taxed, if you know what I mean, Sam.  Scared to go to hip-hop shows, to tell you the truth.  Not a Jay-Z show, really?  I think it's going to be a lot of gunfire is what I always...  I have this impression that you go to a hip-hop show, and it's a lot of gunfire, random gunfire.  I've been to multiple hip-hop shows and never been shot at.  Really?  Yes.  It's safe?  Yeah, but when the lights are down, you really, you know, really fit in. 
[01:07:00]  I'm a little scared.  Because you already got the features, and then you lower the lights, and then who could tell, Sam?  I'm just scared.  A cashier at Target recently told me that I was probably mixed, and I said, I don't know, maybe way back.  She just said that?  She said she was a black woman, a young lady, and she just looked at me as she was ringing me up and says,  What are you?  I was like, what's your problem, person?  You could have thrown something right back at her. 
[01:07:30]  Tell her what she is.  She said if I was mixed, then it was strong because it was really showing.  Wow!  You're very forward.  Yeah, what if you said that to her?  Or, well, if I said that to her.  Or, well, if Danny said that.  Or, well, if Opie said that.  Well, or if 50% of you said that to her.  Well, you finally got a problem, my friend.  98 to go.  That's right.  Yep.  But the bitch ain't one.  No, in this case, the bitch is one.  Oh, that bitch.  See?  Well, Sam, I'm not going to no hip-hop show because I'm with Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  I'm scared.  I'm just scared.  It always looks dangerous.  I can only imagine bringing my girl to a Jay-Z show.  It would be like that scene in Animal House.  Oh, my God.  Mind if we dance with your dates?  Go right ahead.  If I were you, I'd be leaving.  What a good idea.  Oh, my God.  I bet I got to, like, fight for her honor.  Sam, no.  Where do you go to school?  Just to wait for him to sing 99 Problems with the bitch that he wants. 
[01:08:30]  He's got a lot of good songs.  Yeah.  A lot.  Yeah?  Well, he's got that one, 99 Problems with the Bitch Ain't One.  No, I know you've heard that one.  Name one more Jay-Z song that I know.  Yeah, give me one.  You must know H to the Izzo.  That was a huge.  H to the Izzo?  That was a monster.  Why don't we hear a little H to the Izzo, Opie?  All right.  So we can maybe see if we know this.  Jay-Z.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hello?  H to the Izzo?  I can sing it if you want. 
[01:09:00]  I'd rather hear it.  Okay.  As performed by Jay-Z.  Young Hove.  Not you.  What?  Who's Young Hove?  I know what you guys perform.  It's Jay-Z.  Young Hove?  Yeah.  Oh, here it is.  This is H to the Izzo?  Yeah.  I know that sample from somewhere.  Jackson 5.  Yeah, Jackson 5.  H to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  Ugh.  V to the Izzo?  H to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo. 
[01:09:30]  Spells out Hova.  You can't bring that in.  S to the Hitty.  You can't bring that into a job interview, Sam.  Ah, this stinks.  It doesn't.  Is this Hungarian?  Hungarian.  Yeah.  It's another language.  I know that much.  H to the Izzo.  What does that mean?  H to the Izzo.  H to the Izzo.  Means H-O.  Oh, Ho.  V-A.  Va.  V to the Izzo. 
[01:10:00]  Ova.  That's his name.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  V to the Izzo.  All right, listen.  We're losing our audience.  We're gaining new audience.  I'm getting A to the awful.  That's not how it would go.  And is that his second most popular song?  I don't dirt off your shoulders.  Oh, you can't say that.  End to the.  No, stop it.  Oh, boy.  Come on.  That song I've never heard in my life,  and that is the God's honest truth.  I swear to you, Sam.  I never heard that one.  That's Kanye West's first produced hit. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, good for him.  Okay.  Our old station, though.  This leads to an interview that Lisa Page.  Oh.  One of the people that took over for us  at our old rock station that's now what?  Now FM?  Yeah, 92.3 Now.  Yeah.  Now.  Now it sucks.  Well, she got to interview Jay-Z,  and I hear it was just horrendous,  and Sam brought in a couple samples.  It was very frustrating because Jay-Z didn't come here.  He didn't come to Sirius at all.  So, why wouldn't he come here?  Yeah, why wouldn't he come here?  I'm doing a little Shade 45.  This is like, well, 
[01:11:00]  Who Kid has said stuff about Jay-Z.  Oh, really?  He says something about everybody.  Oh, shit, yo.  Maybe Who Kid should stop talking about everybody.  He put out a video where he was riding a camel,  and they say Jay-Z's face looks like a camel.  It kind of does.  He actually made the camel look like  it was lip-syncing Jay-Z's song.  It was not.  That caused some problems.  Yeah.  I was like, I don't understand why.  We had Jay-Z on our show.  You did?  Didn't we?  Oh, maybe not.  He had 50 Cent and Ludacris.  Oh, it was Ludacris. 
[01:11:30]  That's not Jay-Z.  I get them mixed up all the time.  Jay-Z, he does look like Joe Camel.  He does not look like Joe Camel.  A little bit, Sam.  He's been, that's,  looks like the Who Kid has 99 problems, by the way.  Yes.  He's got a lot of problems.  Who Kid's Twitter was hacked yesterday.  I had to text him because  on his Twitter he came out and said,  I am a gay DJ and I'm comfortable with it.  Oh, how did you know it was hacked?  Well, I asked him and it turned out it was.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  The Jay-Z, Linkin Park mashup, Andrew from Illinois. 
[01:12:00]  I've heard that.  Have you?  Of course you have.  They played that on rock stations.  What was the song?  Uh, I don't know.  They remixed 99 problems, right?  I guess they did do a 99 problems.  I think they did.  There's more Jay-Z than just what's played on rock stations.  No, fuck that.  99 problems.  99 songs, but I only know this one.  Yeah.  Fucking A, come on.  You want to hear Lisa Page uncomfortably trying to interview a big star?  Please.  All right.  Jay-Z.  All right. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Dude, right off the bat, that is a great one.  Another wonderful choice.  All right.  Another wonderful choice by CBS Radio.  All right.  Yeah, this is way better than the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, this is great.  All right.  All right.  Boy, if that doesn't say uncomfortable.  All right.  Jay-Z.  I'm here.  Is here.  I'm here.  I'm looking right at you.  Yeah.  You're wearing sunglasses.  Yeah.  But it's not sunny out. 
[01:13:00]  Yes, it is.  A little bit.  Okay, I can't listen.  I have to leave.  I have to leave.  I cannot listen to this.  He's just going to see a little bit.  I started looking around the room and getting real uncomfortable that someone was going to  make eye contact with me, and we would share this embarrassing moment together.  I cannot listen to this.  This isn't college radio, Sam.  This is a big station.  All right.  All right.  They're wearing sunglasses.  He's not known for doing a lot of press.  He doesn't like doing all this stuff.  I would like this.  With the likes of her interviewing. 
[01:13:30]  You want to put your big guns.  Wow.  That was bad.  When Jay-Z's in town, you put your big gun interviewer.  If Jay-Z was here, I would challenge him.  I would say, name the 99 problems.  Yeah.  And how fast can you do it?  And one of them.  We all know that the bitch ain't one.  One of them can't be the bitch.  Right.  So you've got to name 99 problems without naming the bitch.  That's what I would do.  That's the problem.  I wouldn't talk to a...  I wouldn't say nothing else.  How many of your problems can you, you know...  All right.  Go.  Yeah.  Just call out within a minute. 
[01:14:00]  Well, if you listen to the lyrics of 99 problems, the bitch refers to a different thing in  each verse.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It's cheating.  It's not cheating.  So the bitch is all the problems.  No, no, no.  Like, in the second verse, he says...  He's talking about the canines.  So when he says 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, he's talking about the police canine  dog.  Why?  What's wrong with the...  What's wrong with the police canine dogs?  Can you tell...  Can you tell me in the verse...  What problem does he have with the police canine dogs?  The character he portrayed in this song... 
[01:14:30]  Oh, okay.  ...was pulled over.  Yeah.  For what?  He was...  For apparently no reason.  He was doing 55 and a 54.  That...  Is that in the song?  Yeah.  Just stop it.  First of all, there is no 54 mile an hour speed limit.  Well, that's in the song.  Yeah.  We get it.  They're being picky and pulling over a lot of...  Here's what happened.  The fucking guy didn't use his signal or had a taillight out.  He got pulled over.  The thing smelt like weed.  They brought him out of the car and found fucking drugs and a weapon in the vehicle.  And the guy said, I didn't do nothing.  It ain't mine.  They went to arrest him. 
[01:15:00]  He resisted, ran, got taken down, and kept saying, I didn't do nothing.  I didn't do nothing.  Until he had to be tased, cuffed, and put in the car.  Well, Jay-Z thought in his song, he said maybe he was pulled over because he's young and  he's black and his hat's real low.  Okay.  All right.  We get it.  You have a problem with the cops.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, the police dogs.  Now the dogs are fucked.  What do you want?  A society with no fucking cops?  Yeah.  Let's try that out for a while. 
[01:15:30]  Holy shit.  See how that works.  Let's get back to Lisa Page.  Lisa Page.  Sunny out.  Yes, it is.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Your windows need a little cleaning.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  You're from Brooklyn.  You live in New York.  Do you ever come downtown a lot?  Is this like this area?  Do you ever come down to this neck of the woods down here by the water?  I live here.  I know, but do you frequent downtown?  Do you hang out midtown?  All over.  I'm a New Yorker.  I know.  Yeah.  For a long time. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, God.  Holy shit, Sam.  I can't even fucking.  I can't.  And you wonder why Jay-Z doesn't want to do press.  First of all, she's.  I mean.  Wow.  I like a couple of Jay-Z's ditties because I'm reminded of the.  It's a hard knock life.  Hard knock life.  Yeah.  I kind of like that one too.  Oh, that was him?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was him.  That was all right.  That wasn't really.  I don't know the song he had to sample.  Was that him really?  He didn't have to.  There's a lot of sampling done in hip hop.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  It's part.  Hip hop originated with sampling.  This is fucking Annie.  That's the production. 
[01:16:30]  And then the verse is his.  He doesn't even write, you know.  He doesn't write these things.  What?  He doesn't even write his songs?  He never writes a word.  Why would he have to?  This is all from Annie.  No, not this part.  This is from Annie.  No.  Is Annie getting rude?  Jesus Christ.  I like his song, The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow.  That's a good one too.  So Sarah Jessica Parker gets a lot of money every time this song's played?  See, because she played Annie.  Right.  Yeah.  I like his song about Rum Tum Tugger from Cats. 
[01:17:00]  Look.  The hook had a sample.  Let's get back to the Lisa Page.  The hook had a sample.  The whole song is.  But not the verse.  Not the lyrics.  All right.  But in all fairness, Jay-Z is one of the biggest celebrities out there.  Yeah.  He's on this dumb radio station that used to be our home.  And this dumb Lisa Page that, I don't know.  I don't know what she does, really.  Makes $87 million a year.  Lisa Page?  No.  No.  Point Blank is asking, does Jay-Z sing Coin City Yourself at Home? 
[01:17:30]  Coin.  No.  Of course not.  No?  That's Oliver Twist.  Oh.  Oh.  Maybe if we rewrite that one.  But yeah, he's a big celebrity.  And Lisa Page so far is talking about whether it's sunny out.  Yes.  Right.  And whether he actually hangs out in a part of New York City.  Not even if he hangs out.  He lives in New York.  So she's asking, does he ever leave his apartment?  She assumed that since he said he's from Brooklyn in his wraps that he still lives in the project. 
[01:18:00]  He doesn't live in Brooklyn anymore.  He lives in Tribeca.  He got $18.  He left the fucking project.  Just like everybody would.  He lives where she's asking, do you ever hang out here?  Yeah.  And he's like, yes, this is where my house is.  Before you go back to your drug-infested projects in Brooklyn?  All right.  Well, maybe she's just warming it up.  Let's see what she does next with the big Jay-Z interview.  All righty.  What's the best part about living in New York?  It's endless amounts of food anytime. 
[01:18:30]  Or you can find a party at any given time.  Or you can find a cab and go anywhere you like.  You know, in L.A., it's a little more spread out.  So you have to have someone drive you around.  You can just get in a cab anywhere as a teenager.  Do you take the cab?  Hold it on the subway.  Do you take the yellow cab?  You asked me the question.  I'm just giving you an email.  I know.  I know.  She keeps saying, I know.  I know.  I don't understand why she's asking.  There's a lot of parties.  I know.  If you know why you're asking.  Right.  And then she goes right into, do you take a yellow cab? 
[01:19:00]  Why?  Because he's not supposed to be a regular guy, I guess.  Well, no.  And first of all, he doesn't take yellow cab unless he's in what's called a pinch.  Yeah.  And he can't get them too easily.  Yeah.  Because he can't get them.  You know.  Because.  Just ask.  Because it'll pull over for the black guy, Sam.  Danny Glover.  That's what Danny Glover says.  I believe that.  Danny Glover can't get a cab.  Jay-Z can't get a cab.  We did our own little test.  We did it.  Our own little experiment.  Yes.  They picked up the Nazi before they picked up Patrice O'Neill.  Yep.  That is a fact.  Look up the video for yourself.  I SIG-heiled cabs with a Nazi helmet on, and I got more rides than Patrice O'Neill because 
[01:19:30]  he's a black gentleman.  It really is one of the greatest bits we've ever done.  It was fun.  And someone found our Cox in a Box bit.  Oh, Cox in a Box was fantastic.  Someone send the original video to my YouTube channel so I could favorite it because it's worth  playing.  God, the good old days.  The good old days is right.  Here's Lisa Page.  I know.  I know.  A teenager.  Do you take the cab?  On the subway. 
[01:20:00]  Do you take the yellow cab service?  You asked me the question.  I'm just giving you a name.  I know.  But I want to know, Jay.  Do you, like, will we be able to find you, like, in a real yellow cab?  Yeah, I just took the yellow cab the other day.  Did you really?  Yeah, it's like a big thing, though.  It's like a treat for me.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Do you like?  Do you prefer?  It's like a normal thing to do, you know?  So I get in a yellow cab and I feel good about myself.  Now, this could possibly be the worst interview I've ever heard.  I know.  This is horrible. 
[01:20:30]  He goes, like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I would like, um, I would like, um.  I know.  I know.  He goes, this is a treat for me.  And she goes, do you like it?  Do you like it?  Yeah.  Yes.  That's right.  Yeah, I said a treat for me.  What I meant by treat is I hate it.  And how is getting a yellow cab a treat?  A treat, really?  Because he doesn't get to do things that normal people get to do.  For him, it probably is a treat, because a lot of cab drivers are racist and won't pick  up black gentlemen.  So it is a treat when they stop.  I know! 
[01:21:00]  Oh, God, he should have punched her right in the face.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Wow, was she adult.  Well, I guess they continue talking about cabs and the MTA in this next clip.  92.3 problems.  You have seven minutes.  No, nothing.  Sorry.  That's good.  You have seven minutes with Jay-Z, so you need to make sure you spend at least three  talking about cabs.  How do you feel about...  It's real high-tech now.  They have TV commercials and all kinds of stuff in it.  Yeah.  You get the weather.  You get all your...  It's on a loop, so you got to go a short distance. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it gets corny.  Do you...  Are you aware of the MTA hikes?  And what's that going on with all the rate hikes as far as traveling subways?  You're fucking kidding me, right?  She...  She...  The wheels...  The wheels were off when she left.  Let me tell you...  They didn't even fall off.  Let me tell you what these Lisa Pages do for the rest of the industry.  It prevents Jay-Z from coming on real radio shows.  Exactly.  That's what happens.  We are the scourge of entertainment because of people like Lisa Page. 
[01:22:00]  We are the scourge.  We're in a shitty fucking business.  No A-listers want to acknowledge radio guys.  Only the ones that are on their way down.  Because of that.  Do you think that her boss later on was like, this is great.  You did such a good...  Hey, great job with Jay-Z today.  As much as we, you know, are kind of goofing on Jay-Z, he is fucking huge.  Yeah, he's huge.  And you got seven minutes.  Wow.  And she's talking about MTA rate hikes. 
[01:22:30]  Well, Ant, you know why.  Yeah.  Because the new thing with regular radio, and I know people are like, oh no, here we go again.  But they have to go local.  They're telling all their jocks, you got to keep it local.  That's the only way we can compete against satellite radio and the iPhone and the iPod.  Exactly.  That's something they can't get on their iPhone is local stuff.  Keep it local.  Even if you're doing interviews, kind of bring them into the local scene.  Ask Jay-Z about fucking the rate hikes on the MTA. 
[01:23:00]  Like Jay-Z gives a shit about the rate hikes.  A guy that's taken a yellow cab once in the last five years.  Yeah.  You don't give a shit.  God damn.  What's that going on with all the rate hikes as far as traveling, subway?  I'm not.  I just want to let you know.  Okay.  Because I take the one train here, and they're jacking up the rates.  They should stop.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  Okay.  Holler at Mayor Bloomberg.  Yeah.  He said, yeah.  Yeah.  He's sitting there. 
[01:23:30]  Let me tell you what's going through Jay-Z's head right there.  When he said, yeah.  He's looking going, what the fuck is this bitch talking about?  Get me the fuck out of here.  I've been rapping for 13 years.  I've put out 11 albums.  You know, she can't bring up one thing about his music, his fucking album, the concert,  the thing, like anything.  Wow.  Hip-hop, the difference in old school hip-hop and now, I mean, if you want to go hack where  you don't really know, just go like, hey, what's the, you know, what do you think of old 
[01:24:00]  school hip-hop and who is some of your influences?  Like, those hack questions would be 80 times better.  99 times better, if I may use that number again.  But the bitch ain't wrong.  Right.  It's the bitches that it gets you.  It's the bitches that it gets you.  Oh, Jesus.  And this is what has now happened with the interview.  Jay-Z wants out.  Yeah.  He went in there with an open mind.  You could kind of hear it.  Now he's done.  Now he's just watching the clock. 
[01:24:30]  Like, all right, it's another dumb, stupid interview.  And this is why I don't want to do these.  Right.  He's had it.  Yeah.  And then you've got your concert on Friday.  Right.  And then you're over in the UK with Coldplay, which is huge.  They're one of my favorite groups.  Yeah.  I mean, do you hang with Chris Martin?  All the time.  What about Gwyneth Paltrow?  All right.  Look, they don't hang out.  No.  They don't even see each other.  Most of these people don't see each other at the venues.  I'll say this.  Gwyneth Paltrow went on Conan O'Brien and said that her kids called Jay-Z Uncle Jay.  I got an Uncle Tom. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Well, that might not be appropriate.  No, I really do, though.  Yeah, of course.  So I could say that.  Yeah.  I got Uncle Tom.  You got Uncle Tom?  Yes.  All right.  That's getting a little more.  I do.  Do you hang with Chris Martin?  All the time.  How about Gwyneth Paltrow?  All the time.  She's so tall in real life.  Oh, gorgeous.  Yeah, she is gorgeous, huh?  Gosh, we're just so excited to have you.  You're our first, you're my first ever real huge, huge, huge gift. 
[01:25:30]  And your last.  Gift.  Yes.  And a gift.  That's why I'm wearing Christmas colors today, because we are making this a holiday because  you're here.  There you go.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  This is a very good question from Chris on-  I'm stupefied.  Chris on Long Island.  See, you could be in a city, because you're in between the buildings, but like Long Island,  you have to be kind of on it.  Yeah.  Chris writes, how much coke did she do to get ready for the big Jay-Z interview?  I know! 
[01:26:00]  Coke fucking Kane!  Oh, shit.  Very good.  She certainly didn't bother reading any information about Jay-Z before the interview.  Sam, we're going to stop it right there.  No, what happened to the fucking bio?  Sam, we're going to stop it right there.  You're done?  Yeah, we have to stop it right there.  Why?  No more tracks.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  I would love to hear one more.  Oh, man.  I know.  I was really...  Boy, that left him wanting more, because it left me wanting more. 
[01:26:30]  Certainly left me wanting more.  She has a great segment called Six Questions in 60 Seconds with Lisa Page.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  So maybe we want to hear some of that.  She interviewed Sean Paul, like a final Sean Paul audio clips.  Now, what song does he do again?  He does that...  He's done a lot of songs.  Is that her?  Let me see what she looks like.  She's got one hit, I think.  What does she look like?  Is she at least hot?  Who knows?  It's probably 20 Lisa pages on radio.  That's her.  That's her?  She, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  No tits. 
[01:27:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Jesus.  You've got to have at least a hint of a tit.  I don't need a tit monster, but you've got to at least show that you're female.  Who's she talking to there?  That's Kanye.  Oh, that's Kanye?  I don't think so.  They all look alike, Sam.  Is it P.D.?  No, it's P.D.  Christ.  Come on, guys.  Okay.  You're talking about the mics, because the flags are the same.  Exactly.  Yeah.  No, that's a lesser known...  Who is that?  Who is that artist?  I don't even know.  She probably didn't know either.  If you don't know, then I'm saying it's Kanye West. 
[01:27:30]  No, I know it's not Kanye West.  And I was just joking, Sam.  I know you were.  But that's not Kanye West.  Or P.D.  Didn't he do 99 Problems with the Bitch Ain't One?  No, that's J.C.  Oh, okay.  We were just talking about that.  What album was that from?  The Black Album.  But Metallica.  Okay, this is the third time.  Who's that?  Is that Lisa Page?  Uh-uh.  No, that's another...  They started, like, when they first started, they had a whole bunch of hip-hop guys nobody's  ever heard of on their station, I guess, just because no one else would do the fucking  station.  They had Soldier Boy Tell Him on recently. 
[01:28:00]  Who the fuck is he?  Soldier Boy Tell Him?  What war did he fight in?  War?  Soldier Boy.  It's kind of insulting to call yourself Soldier Boy while we're fighting two wars,  Sam.  You know that, right?  S-O-U-L.  Unless he did a little time in Afghanistan or Iraq.  S-O-U-L-J-A.  Soldier.  So he walks around as Soldier Boy as we got our real soldiers fighting for their lives,  Sam?  Soldier Boy Tell Him.  Do you think that's fair?  Crank that.  Crank what?  That's his song.  Oh.  Crank the...  Oh.  Soldier Boy Tell Him.  All the kids are doing the Soldier Boy dance. 
[01:28:30]  That's great.  No, do the Soldier Boy dance.  How about you?  Ew.  Ew.  How about he does the dance in Afghanistan as he's, like, trying to avoid sniper fire,  Sam?  That's Soldier Boy.  Then he can come up with a nice new dance for everybody.  He's Superman-ing hoes.  You know how to Superman a hoe?  It means to ejaculate on their back and then stick the sheet to it. 
[01:29:00]  Looks like a cape.  All right, listen.  We got Larry King on the line, Sam.  Oh.  He's got a question for Jay-Z.  Larry King, it's a pleasure to have you on the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got today, sir?  Ray-Lane will be an ass name.  Hi, Larry.  Hi, Larry.  Jay-Z, is one of your 99 problems that you can't get a cab in New York City?  That's one that isn't a bitch, and it's probably a legitimate problem for Jay-Z.  So I'll give him the cab. 
[01:29:30]  That's one.  Okay, so that's one problem.  One problem.  98 to go.  Come on.  This could be his cashmere.  It's going to be a long song.  Yeah, it's going to be very long.  All right, Sam.  I guess that's good shit.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was a fucking get.  That was a gift.  I mean, a get.  She's awful.  Who is this guy?  That's Soulja Boy Tellem.  That's Soulja Boy.  How could he fight with those glasses on? 
[01:30:00]  He's not a soldier.  His name is Soulja Boy Tellem.  And that heavy chain is going to weigh him down.  Yeah.  And that ain't camouflage.  If he's out in the desert or in the mountains of Afghanistan, he's going to stick out like a sore thumb.  He doesn't fight.  He raps.  But he's a soldier.  No.  Soulja Boy Tellem is his name.  You.  No.  I'd rather hear Ass Man again.  Please.  No.  Yeah.  What?  Damn.  Soulja Boy Tellem is one of the hottest young stars out there right now. 
[01:30:30]  Is it?  I just have a problem with his name when we have real soldiers out there.  S-R-U-L.  Wow.  Soulja.  He's under fire.  Yes.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please follow the police.  I am scared of you, sir.  And I am protecting myself. 
[01:31:00]  He's not a soldier.  He doesn't look like a soldier.  Why is he holding the money in his hand?  Well, yeah.  I was just noticing that, too.  Like, if you're going to be hard, I guess, on the cover of your album, shouldn't you be  holding more than $135 while you discounting the money?  Dude, look.  The front bill is $100.  And then he's got, like, a 20, a 10, and a 5.  20, a 10, and a 5.  He's got one of each bill.  Can you borrow a bunch of hundreds for the album cover?  Exactly.  Photoshoot.  Come on.  It's a photoshoot.  Photoshoot.  Just take the 100 and clock it. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  That was his first single.  He's made many more hundreds.  That is really funny.  Excuse me, Sam.  That is funny.  Because he's supposed to have a stack of Hundys, man.  But I'm sorry to interrupt, but we do have Larry King calling back.  Oh, wow.  Larry, it's a pleasure that you thought enough of us to call back.  What do you got for the show today?  Mr. Z, when you got in the cab, what did you do with the groceries?  Mr. Z.  That's what his name should be. 
[01:32:00]  Sean in Albany.  Sean.  Hey, how can you...  First off, my Popeye's chicken biscuit is delicious.  Oh.  Damn it!  Get me one now!  How can you mention Jay-Z songs, not mention Big Pimpin', man?  Exactly.  Oh, fuck.  He did Spendishese.  It's Big Pimpin', baby.  It's Big Pimpin', baby.  Oh, I thought you were just saying that.  Oh, this looks a little like that.  What's that dance?  Indian.  I want to say salsa, but that's what you have with chips. 
[01:32:30]  What's that dance?  What's the hula?  You know, when you...  Yeah.  It's like kind of like Hispanic, like...  The cha-cha?  No, yeah.  The merengue?  Wow.  Because you don't fucking need them.  You don't need shit, Sam.  You hear that?  First time they fuss, he's breezing.  Yeah.  He's out.  Holy shit.  Enough of this fucking shit. 
[01:33:00]  Okay.  I've had it.  He's got a very diverse audience.  Oh, yeah?  Right.  Yeah, of course.  Sam, do you trust me?  Yeah.  All right, close your eyes.  Oh, no.  Come on over here.  Okay, I don't know.  Close your eyes and come on over here for one second.  No.  Why?  Do what he say.  Please.  Make sure your eyes are closed.  Do we want to put a shirt around him? 
[01:33:30]  Kenny, close his eyes.  I don't trust this fucking...  Yeah.  Don't look at anything.  As far as I can throw him.  What are you doing?  All right, Kenny's going to, like, make you a hostage.  There you go.  Perfect.  All right, give me your finger.  I want you to...  You trust me, right?  No.  I just pushed this button right there.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  It's surely good.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  It's surely good.  No.  Damn.  Wow, Sam. 
[01:34:00]  You're so fired.  Sam, it's really a shame.  Sam, you know something...  You had a hell of a career ahead of you, but...  You tricked me.  We try to, you know, keep it real here, as I like to say.  We try to keep it real.  That's just blatant racism.  We will not stand for it.  You know...  I'm giving Steve Blair a full report.  Don't!  We have fun, but there's a line we just don't cross.  And, uh...  Yeah, I think you did.  What would management say?  Do you trust Anthony? 
[01:34:30]  No.  Not anymore, aren't you?  No.  You guys have done nothing but betray me.  It's called a, uh, make good.  Betray you?  Yes.  Why?  I don't think I betrayed anybody.  Well, I'll be dead.  Yeah.  Do you trust me, Sam?  No.  Do you trust me?  I mean...  Here, come here.  Okay.  Shut your eyes.  All right.  Don't look at anything.  Don't look at anything, Sam.  Shut your eyes.  Keep them closed.  Now, give me your finger. 
[01:35:00]  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now, push that button.  This one?  Yeah.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Oh, my God, Sam.  Now I don't trust you either.  Oh.  You pushed it.  I didn't know what it was.  Well.  What would management say?  Sam.  This is not my idea of humor.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Oh, God.  We're trying to relate to the black man today, and you're ruining everything. 
[01:35:30]  I'm playing a little Jay-Z.  Right.  99 Problems.  That bitch ain't one of them.  Sam, well, we have you in here.  Why don't we continue with black culture?  Okay.  Tyra.  Wow.  Do you want to completely change gears?  This is fantastic.  Oh, wait.  Larry King is checking in again.  What?  Is he?  Yes.  Mr. King, it's a pleasure.  I've been watching you for years.  Wow.  And you're calling our show for the third time today.  What do you got for the show? 
[01:36:00]  Mr. Z, how old did you do you have to slice them?  Oh, my God.  That's ridiculous.  All right.  That's ridiculous.  That's way out of line.  I apologize.  We all know Larry is a little senile these days.  Mr. King.  Wow.  He's not completely there, Sam.  No.  We better move on to the Tyra bit because I just know what could possibly happen from  this point on.  Of course you do.  I've seen this play out a few times.  We've seen that slippery slope happen. 
[01:36:30]  Just go find our fucking Muhammad Ali bit and then enjoy.  Have fun with that one.  Yeah.  It's all the same.  One-liners will be used.  Sam, I emailed you late last night to tell you that Tyra Banks was doing a period show.  That's correct.  Is it good?  I know all there is to know about the female menstrual cycle now.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Thanks to Tyra.  This is the beauty of me.  I find out that Tyra Banks is doing a period show, right?  Yeah.  I go on my BlackBerry and I write Sam. 
[01:37:00]  I'm like, Tyra Banks is doing a period show.  Make sure we have clubs for the show tomorrow.  So Sam comes in here at 530 and goes, oh, so what part of the Tyra Banks period show would  you like because I'm ready to cut it up?  What part?  I go, I didn't watch this show, Sam.  Why would I actually watch the show?  That's your job.  Because I was thinking maybe it's an hour long.  I just, you know, kind of fast forward.  He really thought I was sitting there watching and I couldn't believe what I was seeing and 
[01:37:30]  I, you know, I needed certain things for the show.  I'm like, no, Sam.  I just know it's going to be good radio.  Of course.  I don't have to actually watch it.  So I watched the whole show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it was good?  It was great.  Yeah.  Period show.  Top to bottom.  And again, this is a period show.  It's about women and their periods.  By the way, she's got to put her fucking wig back on.  The big thing with Tyra this season, I guess, she took her hair off.  Wigless?  And, um.  What is she looking like without a wig?  Well, who. 
[01:38:00]  I wish Danny was here to Google it because Sam is really bad at Googling.  I'm not that bad.  You're terrible, by the way.  It was the Flintstones thing.  Oh, with, um, yeah, Sassy.  Sassy.  I was trying to remember the.  When Sassy, uh, Dino was in love with Sassy and then he looked in, uh, the dressing room  and she took her eyelashes off and the wig off.  Yeah.  And, uh, looked terrible.  We should make that, we should do a little split screen because that's what Tyra looks  like without the wig.  She kind of looks like the Sassy.  Sassy.  Yeah.  Her hair is a little, I think it's a little thin. 
[01:38:30]  Is it?  For a supermodel.  It's probably from being pulled back.  Right.  Underneath all those weaves and everything for so many years.  Yeah.  You haven't seen her without her hair yet?  No.  I mean, she's got hair.  It's her, her.  Yeah, but it's an, is it a natural?  Does she pull the wig off for the big reveal, Sam?  What?  Uh, can we shut the phones off?  Nothing but trouble on the phones right now.  Oh, shit.  Nothing but trouble.  How could Larry King be on two different lines at the same time? 
[01:39:00]  Well, we do have Larry calling back because now we're moving into Tyra Banks, uh, stuff.  Uh, Larry, what do you got for the show?  Yuck.  Good evening.  Hey, Larry.  I got a question for Tyra.  Tyra, do you trust anything that bleeds for a week and doesn't die?  Wow.  Larry's really, uh, asking the hard-hitting questions.  Well, yeah.  He knows a little something about, uh, periods, Anthony.  All right.  Whatever.  So let's get into the period show with Tyra Banks. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  She started the period show with this.  Did she have a t-shirt on?  I did see this with a big dot on it.  Did you see?  A big red dot?  No way.  Did you say, didn't she or didn't she and the entire audience?  Really?  Yes.  Even the men?  Even the men.  Were there men in the audience wearing a red period fucking shirt?  Were they men or were they, you know, men?  Well, you know, men.  No.  Fucking castrated, uh, ugh.  Some of the men, and we'll meet one as we play the clips, had to come with their wives  and girlfriends.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[01:40:00]  There we go.  Okay.  Cold red.  Aunt Flo.  Cold cane.  My red-haired cousin.  Surfing the crimson wave.  Elmo.  Who calls it Elmo?  The bitch is back.  The painters are in.  Hell week.  The curse.  These are just a few of the names that you guys have sent to TyraShow.com on a poll  that we had all about what, y'all? 
[01:40:30]  Period.  Okay.  I have to tell you about when I got my period.  Yeah.  Holy mother of fuck.  Period.  They all yelled out periods.  Elmo's pretty funny, though.  Yeah.  I'm on my Elmo.  She doesn't get that?  Yeah.  Elmo's red.  That's what I get, you dummy.  It's anything that's red.  Right.  Dolt.  You dunce.  Stupid ass.  Tyra's a dunce.  Dummy.  What are we Google bombing today?  Tyra has a heavy flow?  Tyra's period. 
[01:41:00]  Tyra's heavy flow.  Should we go with Tyra's heavy flow?  Go with Tyra's heavy flow.  Should we work the word clumpy in there, too?  Oh, shit.  Tyra's clumpy heavy flow.  Is that what we're going with officially?  Yeah.  That's it officially.  Say it again.  Google bomb.  Tyra's clumpy heavy flow.  Oh, let's make that number one by 930.  Although I think the Google trends are on to us, unfortunately.  Oh, shit.  That's great.  Tyra tells a story of her first period. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, God.  What'd she have, home ec?  Oh, my God.  No, no.  I hope it's like the scene in Carrie where they threw tampons at her and said, plug it up,  plug it up.  Oh, shit.  First of all, I got it in the 11th grade.  What?  What?  Her first period.  Is that when they finally removed her dick?  Oh, Jesus.  That's a little late for a girl getting her period.  How old are you in the 11th grade, by the way? 
[01:42:00]  16.  16 going on 17.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You should know this.  I know.  Well.  That means almost ready for you.  Almost there.  Almost there.  Almost there.  Stay on target.  11th grade getting your period.  That is a little old.  You think most girls are like 12?  I'm thinking, yeah, 12, 13.  Yeah.  14 is kind of late in this day and age. 
[01:42:30]  14?  She's talking 16.  She's 16?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  14's a little late, and she's saying 16.  Maybe that was her first official period because she was giving birth from the age of 12 to 16.  Oh, you think she was pregnant?  Where are those kids?  You know what?  I'll tell you something.  Hold on, Ann.  We got Larry King checking back in.  What's wrong with you?  We stopped the show for the great Larry King.  Yes, Larry.  Larry?  Tyra, how important is the cunt plug? 
[01:43:00]  Just the cunt plug.  Come on.  Boy.  Larry.  I wish Google had a sense of humor because, man, do I have a Google bomb for everybody.  That is a good one.  But we have to go with what?  Tyra's?  Tyra's clumpy, heavy flow.  People are questioning how do we spell flow today.  Well, it's like flow.  F-L-O-W.  Yeah, you got to go old school.  Yeah, not like the waitress.  Jay-Z would spell it F-L-O, right?  Flo.  Flo-Rido would.  Who the fuck is Flo-Rider? 
[01:43:30]  F-L-O space R-I-D-A.  It's spelled like Florida.  Flo-Rido.  Oh, I get...  Ugh.  He's got some hits.  Does he?  Does he?  Yeah, man.  I'd love to get that.  First of all, I got it in the 11th grade.  Like, really, really late.  11th grade.  And I think it's because I was really skinny, and when you're thin, you don't have enough  body fat, and there's not enough estrogen working up in your stomach or something.  Stomach.  You can still get a few droplets out. 
[01:44:00]  Was there spotting?  Doesn't she know?  Do you hate spotting, Sam?  It's not in your tummy.  I've never spotted.  Are you a fan of spotting?  Not as a practice, I guess.  You ever see any spotting?  Oh, what?  Larry King is checking in.  Larry King is on the phone?  I just want to check with you.  Mr. Imus said it best when he said do it in characters, right?  Exactly.  Okay.  I just want to make sure.  All right.  Hello, Larry.  Hey, Opie.  Wait a minute.  No.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[01:44:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's not how you do the Larry bit.  You completely blew it.  Don't break character if you're Larry King.  You're not a character.  You're actually Larry King.  What?  Are you insane?  All right.  Let me go to another caller.  All right.  All right.  I'll help with him.  Hi, Larry.  Epic fail.  And he had line of the day easily.  King failure.  Easily line of the day.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Which we brought back officially yesterday. 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  For the old schoolers.  Something I don't know, but it was, I was 15 years old and I was at my dad's house.  My parents are divorced.  And so it was the weekend when I was at my dad's.  But my period started and I was sitting on the toilet and I saw something in my panties  and I was like, oh my God, it's my period, it's my period, it's my period.  And I knew about the period because my mom taught me about it, but I didn't want to have  it in front of my dad.  So I called my mom crying like, mama, I got my period, I got blood on my panties, I got  blood on my panties.  And I don't want you to tell daddy, don't tell daddy, please don't tell him. 
[01:45:30]  And she's like, no problem.  I'm going to, you know, call him right now and just tell him you're not feeling well  and he's going to take you home to my house.  And I was like, okay.  So she instructed something to me.  She was like, do you have any pads?  I'm like, ma, I didn't know it was coming.  I don't have any damn pads.  Your days of finger banging, old Mary Jane Rottencroft through her pretty pink panties  are over.  Yes.  Oh God, sham.  You know what?  She's not hot enough to deal with that. 
[01:46:00]  She used to be.  That fucking babble.  Shut up.  Where is that private pile?  Sir, jelly donuts, sir.  Is it?  Is it?  Oh God, damn.  Larry's checking in, Anthony.  It's in the home.  It is.  Larry King, you mean?  It's a pleasure that you're calling our show today.  What do you got?  Hey, boys. 
[01:46:30]  Hi, Rob.  Do you know if you can walk through mud, you can fuck through blood?  Wow, he must be on speed dial, because guess what?  I've never heard of that one before.  Larry King is back.  Larry!  Tyra, did you pick your own cotton to stick it up there?  Oh, come on now.  You know, I knew Larry would go too far.  Come on now. 
[01:47:00]  Something to me, she was like, do you have any pads?  I'm like, ma, I didn't know it was coming.  I don't have any damn pads.  I didn't say damn, but I got slapped through the phone.  So she's like, okay, take some toilet tissue, ball it up, put it in your panties, pull it up,  and you're going to be okay as your dad takes me to the house.  So my dad's driving in the house, and he calls me Buster and stuff, and he's like,  so Buster, how you doing?  And I'm like, I'm okay.  Buster Hyman.  My stomach hurts a little bit.  And he's like, oh, Buster, it's okay. 
[01:47:30]  You're just spotting.  I'm like, oh, my God, I'm on the bottom!  Oh, shut up.  Holy shit.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  This is interesting.  Terrible.  Holy shit.  That is horrible.  You think she's hot enough to have to listen to that shit?  No.  Wow. 
[01:48:00]  It's a good story.  It's a good story.  I mean, at least it's like, you know.  I wonder how our father knew.  Smells like...  Victory!  Does it?  All right, I can play.  Oh, yeah?  Let's see what I got.  Yeah, I think I know which one I'm looking for.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Game on.  All right, game is on. 
[01:48:30]  I'll start with an easy one.  All right, you go with one.  I'm going to start with an easy one.  A little bunch single.  All right.  Tyra's father.  As Tyra's freaking out in the car.  You're going to be okay.  Just a little bunch.  Yeah.  Well, Tyra asked her father, Daddy, how did you know that I was spotting?  He said, I can smell your cunt.  Wow, that's out of the park.  We need John Sterling.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Jesus.  Danny Porter!  No thank you, Tyra.  No.  If you're spotting, I don't, we don't want a panty point.  No.  A negro.  What?  That's terrible.  Try the wine.  Oh, that's not wine.  Oh, God.  And Tyra's father.  What's wrong with the tampons we got?  They plug pretty good. 
[01:49:30]  Tampax.  Some of those other tampons.  The one with wings.  Wings of a maxi.  Oh, dear Lord.  Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  Tyra's dad.  This can't be happening, man.  This ain't happening.  Wow.  Oh, Larry's calling back in.  Larry King?  The Larry King.  Wow. 
[01:50:00]  Larry, what do you got for the show today?  Good morning.  How are you fellas doing?  Tyra, is it difficult to keep in the plunge and the vag when you've got a prolapsed vagina?  Larry knows how to ask the questions.  I tell you.  He's great.  Hey, Larry.  I think they're cloning Larry.  They must be cloning him.  Yeah.  Let's continue with the period party that Tyra decided to have.  Volva.  You are never to blame. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  You are, though.  Okay.  I was so upset.  So once I got past the embarrassment and getting back home to my mom, my mom sat me down and  she told me all about the period.  Now, she said that there are three ways that you can tell a woman is on her period.  All right.  Who wants to start?  All right.  All right.  Who wants to start?  Hmm.  Three ways. 
[01:51:00]  Three ways, Sam.  Let's see.  I mean, if seagulls are circling like you threw a french fry on the beach, that's what I think.  Delivery, horrible.  Yet, I...  Hold on.  George in Alabama has a very good observation about spotting.  Yes, George.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Sam, you're going to know a whole lot about spotting after Fur Fright 2009. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, boy.  Always has to come back to Fur Fright.  Well, we're only 36 days out and you still don't have an official costume, Sam.  What?  You know, they were getting on us a little bit because you're half black, but you can say  Uncle Tom.  Oh, but you can't say Uncle Tom.  That's right.  Oh, it's true.  I have to say Uncle Tom because I got an Uncle Tom for real.  Thomas.  You can't say it, though.  His name's Tom Hughes.  Look it up.  Thomas. 
[01:52:00]  I got an Uncle Tom.  Thomas, please.  Do I have to bring him in here?  He should be Thomas.  It is the dent, the scent, and the accident.  What?  What is the fucking dent?  What, did someone kick her in the cunt?  No.  What happened?  What's the dent?  She explained.  She'll do a better job than I will.  The dent, the scent, and the accident. 
[01:52:30]  Dude, bad Andy.  Holy fuck.  Stop listening so closely.  He writes, Ant.  Uh-oh.  Opie, are you going to bury Tyra's show in the woods?  Thank you, Danny.  Oh, wow.  And I found my first tampon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It kind of freaked me out.  I didn't know what to do with it after I stared at it.  Yeah.  And marveled at it for a while.  I remember that.  And then I had to bury it.  I don't know.  Poor little feller.  I put him in a shoebox.  Took out the nuts and bolts and whatnot. 
[01:53:00]  Poor little feller.  Feller.  Down, and she told me all about the period.  Now, she said that there are three ways that you can tell a woman is on her period.  Yeah.  It is the dent, the scent, and the accident.  You got it?  Y'all know what the dent is?  You got a big-ass pad, and it's like denting your clothes up.  Oh, I've never seen that.  How about the blood, the crud, and the goopy thud? 
[01:53:30]  Oh.  What the fuck is she talking about?  The dent.  Sometimes when a woman wears a large maxi pad, you can see it through the-  It's a bulge, not a dent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She just tried to-  She just wanted to rhyme all her shit.  Yeah, she didn't know what a dent was.  We all like rhyming, but if it doesn't work, you got to try something else.  Maybe under the bulge is the dent, and then there's another bulge.  Like, there's a small area between them.  The dent, the scent. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, that's gross.  You know, maybe she shouldn't bring that up.  No.  We all know it's there, but it's something we don't like talking about.  She should have rhymed.  It's like Bigfoot.  Twat.  Yeah.  Twat.  The slot.  Slut.  Billy Bats checking in?  That's very strange.  Billy Bats?  Let me say hi to Billy Bats.  Hey, Billy Bats.  Tyler, you drift on my shoes.  Now go home and get your fucking shine. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  Fucking Billy Bats.  What an honor.  It really is.  Tyra gives her mom three ways.  Yeah, okay.  We did that one, Sam.  Yeah.  Tyra calls the light flow audience members bitches.  She doesn't like that some people in the audience only have a light flow.  So she's admitting she's got like a heavy fucking flow, this Tyra?  Well, you can let the clip speak for yourself.  Two examples here.  Basically, you're going to get a range anywhere from four to 12 teaspoons.  It's really not that much, although it may look like more. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, my gosh.  This is kind of a lighter day.  This is towards the end.  Oh, that's one day?  Well, no, for the whole cycle.  Oh, for the whole cycle?  Yeah.  Okay.  And, you know, you can imagine that it doesn't look like that much, but if you're changing  your pads every couple hours, that's a sign that you may have more than a normal amount,  you'll probably talk to your doctor about it.  Who has like a heavy period?  Raise your hands.  Heavy periods?  Heavy periods?  Yeah?  Heavy?  Heavy?  Who has like light?  Like, oh, two days and it's just over and I don't care.  Lucky one.  Bitches!  Bitches! 
[01:55:30]  Oh, God, they are applauding.  It's not a tumor.  It's not.  Let me say hi to Larry King.  He's checking in, Anthony.  Larry King?  Yes, he's got an easy pass to our show.  Larry, what do you got?  I'm Gordon.  Larry's really getting into the spirit of the radio show.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, Larry.  Tyra, when you look at your period blood, can you actually see the sickle cells swing 
[01:56:00]  around?  Oh, Larry.  Oh, come on.  You know, some of this.  We try to have Larry on to have a little fun.  That's not fair.  And it just always goes in that direction.  No reason.  Let's go to Bear in Maryland.  Bear.  Hey, boy, how you doing?  Very good, Bear.  This made me think a little, Jimmy, but you guys missed the line.  Yeah.  It's the twat.  The slot and the clot.  The twat, the slot, and the clot.  There you go.  Good job.  Might be the line of the day.  You might be in there. 
[01:56:30]  Larry King was, there was a couple of times Larry called.  Oh, my God.  That is disgusting.  A whole show on periods.  You know what?  He pitched that one.  You know what?  And if we did this on radio and even went to the lawyers and said, well, not this radio.  This radio is cooler.  Regular radio, you go to the lawyers.  Look, we want to educate people and talk about periods for 20 minutes on our show.  They would fucking say, no way.  And if we did it anyway, we'd get fired.  So you're talking about it too long is what it is.  So you can't dwell on the subject. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  Don't mention period, blood, vaginas, ovaries, eggs, womb, vulva.  How are we supposed to talk about it?  Say coochie coo and ant flow.  What's fucked up is TV is turning into radio circa late 90s.  Yeah.  They're getting away with all this stuff and eventually, you know, they'll have their own problems.  Yeah.  Tyra talks to an emasculated man in the Tyra audience whose wife wears a diaper to bed. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, how cute.  Some of the girls I've been with do the same thing.  Oh, my God.  Now, Luke has a question about his wife's period.  Luke, what's your question?  Well, as you can see, my beautiful wife here, she's gorgeous.  You're going to tell a national audience that your fucking wife wears a diaper to bed.  Where's a diety to bed?  This guy's a catch, huh?  Intelligent. 
[01:58:00]  She's Georgetown educated.  Hilarious.  Great things.  But.  But.  Like once a month, she breaks these out.  And wears.  She wears an adult diaper.  Are you serious?  No, he's not.  You wear the diaper for your period?  I'm going to help out millions of your viewers today.  I do.  On the heavy flow nights, the diaper.  It comes out.  I wear it to bed.  And I sleep like a baby.  Wait, so do you put like a pad in it and then put the diaper on?  No, the diaper does the job, honestly. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, my God.  Don't need a tampon, ladies.  Don't need a tampon.  Are you a little maggot?  You make me want to vomit.  A fucking diaper to bed?  If you're married to a woman that's wearing a diaper to fucking bed once a month for a fucking week.  And she's not 80.  Yeah, yeah.  And she makes you go to the Tyra Banks show and sit in the audience and wear a period T-shirt.  And tell the story of how she wears a diaper and how wonderful and beautiful she is.  And Georgetown educated. 
[01:59:00]  You are no fucking man, my friend.  Would you call that a problem for that lady?  Uh, yeah.  She's got 98 more.  That's right.  That's a heavy flow day if you're wearing fucking diapers.  Well, Anthony.  Goddamn.  Please.  Looks like one of those things they put on a guy's chest in Vietnam after a sucking chest wound.  Please clear the field.  Yeah, why?  Larry King is checking.  Larry King?  Yes.  Wow.  Ugh.  Let me say hi to Larry King.  Larry. 
[01:59:30]  Tyra, I want to know if your period blood is the same color as your pink sock.  Pink sock.  Uh, Larry.  Wow.  Another question?  More than your dicks.  More than your dicks.  Oh, Tyra, you pussy's like a blood gun?  Oh, jeez.  Larry.  Larry's really getting a little rambunctious.  Larry.  Larry's got another question.  What?  Personality means you gotta take it to the personnel.  How important is the string? 
[02:00:00]  I would assume the string's pretty important or you can't get the tampon out.  I got a question.  Do they have any tampon string discussions in this whole thing?  They actually didn't really talk about the string.  Oh, that's a shame.  The string is a very important part.  My question is this.  How long is the delay that the listeners are finally catching on?  Exactly.  Want to tear down a wall or nothing?  Tyra talks about learning to sue a...  Sue?  Sue?  It says S-U-E here.  A tampon at age 27? 
[02:00:30]  Use?  Use.  I'm dyslexic.  You're list-exic.  Oh, good gravy.  For years and years, like 10 years, I wore pads.  One day, I'm at my friend's house.  And that friend happens to be Kimora Lee Simmons, you know, baby fat?  Kimora?  Yeah.  So I'm at Kimora's house, and I start my period.  And I'm like, dang, Kimora, you got a pad.  I need a pad.  Girl, I'll use something in pads.  What do you use a passport, girl?  I don't know.  What do you use a pad?  And she's like, take this. 
[02:01:00]  And I was like, what?  There was like nothing in her hand.  She's like, take this.  I'm like, what is it?  There's nothing.  She opened it, and it was a little ass tampon with no applicator.  And I'm like, what the hell is that?  And she's like, it's applicator-less, girl.  So Kimora, 10 years later, after the high school girls tried to talk me into the tampon with the applicator,  Kimora talked me through how to insert a little one that you put in with your finger.  You know what I'm talking about?  And ever since then, I'm an applicator-less tampon girl. 
[02:01:30]  Yay!  Thank you, Kimora.  God damn rich cunt.  She started using tampons at 27 years old?  She said also on the show that she tried to use a tampon in high school, but it kept popping out of her.  How big is her pussy?  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Fuck.  It was a sock.  She used a fucking toilet paper roll.  Really? 
[02:02:00]  A sock.  Oh, that's disgusting.  Larry.  Larry King?  What?  Yes, the Larry King answer.  Of course it is.  Hey, Tyra.  Does this scent resemble in any way garlic?  Garlic.  Thank you, Larry.  Yeah.  Welsh's grape juice.  He just says it.  Well, Larry was just listening to that last clip. 
[02:02:30]  Yes, Larry.  Hey, Tyra.  How many tampons does it take to fill that crater you call a cunt?  Oh, wow.  Larry's getting really nasty.  Larry.  One question for you, Tyra.  Did your father earn his red wings that night?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  It's in character.  Yeah, it's in character.  Of course.  Tyra has her audience members drop their period panties into the period pit. 
[02:03:00]  What?  What is this?  Oh, you got to, of course, you know, not only did all the audience members wear their period  t-shirts, but they all brought from home their period panties.  Did the audience get attacked by rats?  They brought their period panties?  Yes, the ones that get stained and you wouldn't wear them normally. 
[02:03:30]  Because Tyra thinks everybody should wear hot period panties.  Blood-stained panties are going to be thrown into a fucking what?  What is the period pit?  It's just like a cauldron, almost.  And then what?  Does she make soup?  Tomato soup.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Steve from Bayshore.  She makes cunt chowder. 
[02:04:00]  That's horrible.  We haven't been this raw in a long time.  Oh, God, it's terrible.  Well, when you got a subject matter like this, where the fuck is Tyra is out of control?  Speaking of which, Larry.  Larry King?  Yes, the Larry King, Sam.  Who else, you idiot?  Okay.  Why so much focus on punctuation when it's your grammar that is so bad?  It's not punctuation, Larry.  It's uterus blood.  It's blood from an egg. 
[02:04:30]  You know, Sam, I'm not playing the last clip.  Why?  We don't need to know about the period pit.  Some people are going to sit there wanting to know about the period pit.  I kind of want to know about it.  Then they should use the Google.  But then you're going to send somebody to somebody else's show.  We want to keep the listeners here with us.  Yeah, that's true.  We don't want them distracted by YouTube.  Sam, will you shut up?  Larry's on the phone.  Larry!  Oh, yes, sir.  Yes?  Tyra?  Yeah?  Is that the only white thing that's ever been in your gas?  Oh, yes. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  You know, come on.  Larry always.  Anderson Cooper moves in.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  He's a loose cannon.  Come on, Larry.  We can't have him on CNN anymore.  You can't be trusted.  No.  Okay, now before we go, I want to show you guys these new panties.  Do you see these panties here?  These are new panties.  And these are like amazing period panties because they have an anti-leak coating in the center and the back.  Yeah, you got to get that true coat on your panties.  That's what you got to do.  You should go for the true coat.  What the fuck happens with women when we're not around, Sam? 
[02:05:30]  They leak.  They're leaking.  They're wearing diapers.  It's just horrible.  What the fuck is going on?  It's going on.  Women are leaking.  I'm not adverse to a good plowing during the period.  I don't care.  That's a little rough.  I don't fucking care.  What's the big difference between vaginal fucking fluid, which is pretty much mucus, and blood? 
[02:06:00]  I'll tell you, because it starts out as a very, very nice lube.  Yeah.  And then gets extremely sticky.  Well, they can still get wet during it.  They do lubricate themselves.  I understand that.  They're self-lubricating.  I understand that.  Yeah.  There's a stickiness that comes into play.  Yeah.  Like you're fucking a beehive.  Like, honey?  It starts out fine, and then...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, well, Larry's checking in. 
[02:06:30]  Larry.  My God.  It's about time he calls our show.  Larry.  Good evening.  Good evening, Larry.  Oh, Larry.  Tyrant, your show sucks.  Period.  Period.  Oh.  Wow, I think that was really Larry, by the way.  Yeah, that was a very clever Larry King.  We appreciate the clever Larry King.  The only problem with fucking on the period is when you're done, you gotta rinse, because  your balls kind of look like two candy apples.  I've had that.  Yeah, you know. 
[02:07:00]  Gotta get that off there.  Larry?  Larry.  Yes.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Oh, sure.  Is it true that you send the used panties to Dr. Steve so he can make wine?  Is Dr. Steve's wine made out of period panty juice?  I don't know.  We'll ask Dr. Steve that.  Very good question, Mr. King.  Yeah.  I gotta hang up on all the people that aren't Larry.  Oh, that aren't Larry? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, I gotta keep the phone lines open for Larry King.  It's a big get for our show.  Coating in the center and the back.  Crisp crumb coating.  Crisp crumb coating.  It doesn't sound right.  Crisp crumb coating.  Coating.  Coating.  Ah, it smells like fish from the fjords.  I did it right the first time.  Okay, now before we go, I want to show you guys these new panties.  Do you see these panties here?  These are new panties.  And these are like amazing period panties because they have an anti-leak coating. 
[02:08:00]  In the center and the back.  So, yeah.  What's going on in the back?  What's going on in the back that she needs it?  Come on.  Maybe if you're laying down.  Too much lustra.  Is there a lustra?  That causes the leaky hiney?  Does it come with a patch kit where you rough it up with the lid and use the glue and put  the rubber patch on it if you spring a leak?  I used to love those.  Rough up your tire tube.  God damn. 
[02:08:30]  Well, let's go to Larry, Anthony.  Larry King.  Yeah, Larry.  This is Larry.  I don't want to know.  Is it dark in the bed?  We're going to shoot.  Watch out, boy.  What's wrong with me?  I love the different foam lines, I think.  The different connection.  Makes Larry sound a little different each time.  That guy was a nervous knellie.  That really was.  Ah, shit. 
[02:09:00]  What an ass.  Let's try this, Larry King.  I mean, Larry King.  Yeah, Larry's got a lot of questions.  Larry King?  Hi, Larry.  Hi, this is Larry.  I want to know how many licks it takes to get to the bloody center.  Oh, jeez.  It's not a Tootsie Pop.  Stop.  So, even if you have a period accident, as my mama would say,  it's not going to ruin your clothes. 
[02:09:30]  Okay, so right now, we need to see how you can throw away  their nasty old grandma-stank, stained, ugly-ass period panties  right now in our period pit.  Go on over.  Throw them away.  Throw them away.  Oh.  Son of a bitch.  Um, Larry, uh, checking in. 
[02:10:00]  Larry!  Yes.  Hi, boys.  Hi.  I use these nifty suspenders to hold on my, uh, pant.  What you up a friend method?  I was wondering why.  I was wondering why.  All right, there you go.  Tyra did a period show.  Uh, sir, would you have, uh, sex with a girl during her period?  Oosh.  Ah.  All right.  Wow, wow, wow.  Doesn't seem to care.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Great to hear from him. 
[02:10:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah.  Ah.  That's great.  I think we've done enough radio for today's show.  Oh, my goodness.  We just gave you two straight hours.  I am serious.  I've been staring at this sandwich, and I don't even want to eat it anymore  from that disgusting display.  Tyra and Larry King's inane questions.  Here's the thing.  We've still got a lot more to do.  Jim Jeffries still to come.  This is still a type of atmosphere where two hours is going to seem like not enough time.  You've still got two hours of show, and it's not enough time. 
[02:11:00]  Such a little kiss-ass.  What do you mean?  Ugh.  Yeah, man.  You guys are doing a great show so far, and it's only going to get better from here.  Why does it have to be so far?  Yeah.  We gave the people what they wanted.  Yeah.  No, I mean, tune us in for some laughs, and we gave them the laughs.  We got a brewer bit or something.  Throw us.  Lig-a-lig.  Think about the feeling of accomplishment you guys will get.  It's so weird that Brewer's coming by today.  No.  I said that, Ann.  It's really strange.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I know.  Very strange.  He's going to be here at 10 o'clock.  I don't know.  I don't know if he is. 
[02:11:30]  No, Brewer will be here at 10 o'clock.  Trust me, Sam.  Well, I feel like you might get bumped because you're having so much fun.  No.  No.  No.  No.  All right.  Let's take a little breather.  Yeah, there's a lot of Larry Kings checking in, though.  Oh, is there?  Oh, my God.  Well, we can't blow off Larry, then.  Okay.  Yeah, we can.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because that one, that one, and that one will get us fired.  Jim Jeffries has arrived.  Very good. 
[02:12:00]  I like him.  Sam, we're going to take a 20-minute break.  There's no reason for it.  That's a 20-minute break.  Why not?  Because we'll just take enough time off from the show to put in, because the sponsors would  like to say a few words.  Excuse me.  Thank you.  Something wrong with the mic?  That's good.  No.  The mic is perfectly fine.  It's not on.  You're ruining our show, Sam.  Yeah, Sam.  What are you doing?  You invited me in.  Well, he ruined a gig.  Yeah.  You can't be part of a good segment. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  That's going to confuse everybody.  Rob Zombie, sure.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Very good work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We're going to take a break.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, Anthony Cumia talks about oral self.  What's this other word?  Pleasure, I guess?  Oral self-pleasure.  We'll play it after the break.  Brand new production.  Oh.  One more clip from Tyra.  Oh, there is?  Yes, there's one more clip from Tyra. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my ass is like all falling out.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur.  Is that from the video that made Bobby puke yesterday?  Yes, sir.  Right on, man.  Right on.  All right, fuckers.  We'll be back.  God damn.  I forgot about that one.  Teddy Mountain Highway.  Fucking Jimmy.  Jimmy's in L.A. for a while. 
[02:13:30]  He'll be checking in with his voicemails and stuff.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Jeffries has joined the program.  Hello.  And we could be happier.  We love Jim.  Yes.  Oh, that's very nice to you.  Fucking asshole lives way too far away to become a regular on the show.  If I was a regular, he wouldn't like me so much.  So we get him when we can.  It's nice if I just come in every now and again.  Just pop in and every appearance is a winner.  Yeah.  Last time I was here, vomited in a garbage bin.  It's a stellar performance.  I've been speaking to one of my brothers for two years and I get this text that just went,  ha ha, you vomited in a bin. 
[02:14:00]  Even though we don't get along anymore, it's just nice to know that he follows my career.  Yeah, at least he's following.  What was the disgusting thing that was going on?  It was Jim Norton's belly button.  Oh, his belly button stank.  And I've been trying since to get my belly button to have some type of, like I just like  left a puddle of jizz in there and then gone to sleep and then still nothing.  No, come on.  It's got to smell.  No, it doesn't.  And I've got a bit of, I've got like an irritated bit of skin there.  I still don't have a smelly belly button. 
[02:14:30]  Maybe it's just that my jizz is always fresh.  You've got to have it.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe that's it.  You've got to have a deep belly button.  I've got a, I've got one.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a monster.  Do a sit up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's very nice.  Do a sit up.  At least we can tell we're comfortable with each other.  We've finally crossed that boundary.  Yeah.  I'm a bit overweight.  Yeah.  How did it happen?  A drunk who lives in hotel rooms?  Why would I be overweight? 
[02:15:00]  I'm just eating a bagel that's got a sausage.  A sausage.  Sausage.  I don't like this flat sausage.  I don't understand the flat sausage.  Sausage should be long.  Sausage.  The flat, yeah.  American thing.  You ever hear the, you ever hear the Jimmy Dean's sausage?  Yeah, I was even, that was my favorite things ever.  Jeffries is going to be at Caroline's.  I know you're, you're blown up because look what they just gave Jim Jeffries.  It used to be a day, a couple, a couple spots.  Yeah.  He's going to be at Caroline's tonight through Sunday. 
[02:15:30]  Holy shit.  Sunday shows.  Nice.  That means this man is blowing up.  Nice.  So get your tickets to see Jim Jeffries at Caroline's all weekend long starting tonight.  212-757-4100.  Caroline's is great too.  Yeah.  Fucking Greg and the gang.  Damn good club, man.  They take care of us big time.  Big time.  Very good.  And so does Vinny when we get down in the stress factory, but he's far away.  What's the stress factory?  Is that a comedy club or just a place?  Yeah.  Look, we're supposed to be promoting Caroline's, but let me tell you something.  Get your ass to the stress factory down the road. 
[02:16:00]  You'll do very well there.  It's about 40 minutes outside the city.  Oh, okay.  That's cool.  But it's an easy ride.  It's a nice little town, you know.  And Vinny takes you out for a little dessert and stuff after your set.  Lovely.  He's very needy.  He really is.  He really is.  Who's Vinny?  He owns the place.  Oh, he owns the place.  It's not like another comic or something.  No, he's a comic.  I think he owns the place.  So where's all the other comedians today?  It's very quiet.  Yeah, well, Jimmy's away, and then we figured you're the guy. 
[02:16:30]  Is he doing that couple of dicks movie?  You're the guy.  No, he finished that one up.  I auditioned for that part.  Did you?  Yeah.  For the Norton part?  Yeah, for the Norton part, yeah.  Oh, shit.  I did all right as well in the audition, but then when I did the callback, I just couldn't  fucking nail the American accent.  Some days I have it, and then some days I'm just like, it was like a part of a criminal  in the back of this taxi, and I was like, hey, I'm a criminal.  Oh, what are you going to do?  It's like when you do, you're Australian, and you sound like, yeah.  For like three words, and then it falls apart. 
[02:17:00]  Then you lose it.  I actually walked out of the audition going, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for wasting your time.  And it wasn't like they even were nice to me and sort of went, oh, you didn't do that  bad.  They were just-  Yeah, we don't accept your apology.  Yeah, it's like when you vomit at a party in front of everybody, and they're just like,  oh, it's best if you leave.  I'm sorry.  Best if you leave.  It's all right.  Come back some other time.  We'll still like, but not today.  Just get out of here.  I'll call you.  So they gave it to Norton.  People are asking about the hair plugs, because last time you were on the show- 
[02:17:30]  They're not plugs.  And we asked this too, because you walked in with a hat on, and we're like, I remember  that look when Ant started, covering up some stuff.  Yeah.  And you said, no, you're not doing the hair follicle thing.  I'm on Propecia.  Propecia?  Does that shit work?  Propecia's all right.  It's just a tablet you take each day.  They say it regrows hair, but it really just keeps what you got.  Keeps it from coming out.  And I haven't got any extra hair, but the hair that I have got is now slightly stronger,  because that's when you start going bald. 
[02:18:00]  You notice it gets like an inch, and then it starts to go wispy and all that shit.  And then when you see things on TV where they're like Queer Eye for the straight guy, and there  will be like someone going, you know your hair looks best if you don't wash it every  day.  No, your fucking hair looks best, mate.  My hair turns into greasy shit that needs to be washed every day.  Don't you tell me about my fine, wispy strands.  I have to wash my hair twice a day to make it look thick.  Yeah.  I go one day, I look like a fucking chemo patient. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  For real.  Well, this is the whole thing about Propecia, right?  No conditioner, by the way.  It shrinks the prostate, which is the gland in your asshole, the male G-spot.  I love it how anything that feels good, we have to steal it off the women.  It's the male G-spot, is it really?  I think it actually has a purpose, doesn't it?  It's just not meant to feel good.  It makes semen.  It makes the clear stuff that then the sperm swim in.  Yes, and it's also good if you rub a cock against it, evidently. 
[02:19:00]  Apparently.  But I don't think that's its main purpose.  Yeah.  And so it shrinks the prostate and, you know, but you get to keep your hair.  So on the downside, you don't enjoy anal sex, but you get to keep your hair, right?  And like, why do you want to keep your hair?  So you get more anal sex, right?  So people are in there.  Yeah, but now you don't have a good G-spot.  So I don't know.  I'm like, fuck, what do I do?  And how did they figure this out?  It was a pill for prostate cancer.  It was a pill for prostate cancer, and what they did was people used to take it, and 
[02:19:30]  then they were also having chemo.  And there was all like these guys with afros that were like, yeah, I'm a cancer patient.  Giant heads of hair.  Yeah, the doctors were like, hey, we've got something here.  Big swooping heads of hair.  Yeah.  As they're getting chemo.  It's lowered my libido as well.  It has.  Yeah, I just don't.  They say that's a side effect with some people.  It'll lower your libido.  You won't be as horny and shit like that.  I don't, you know, maybe it's just, yeah, I'm kind of happy because my libido is getting 
[02:20:00]  out of control for the same reason I smoke cigarettes, right?  My erections were getting too large.  I look at those facts and just go, we've got to ruin this somehow.  We've got to deplete this.  No, because I masturbate.  This is the thing is, you speak to most comics.  I think they masturbate at least four times a day.  Nothing else to really do.  Nothing to do.  You're in a hotel.  You're in a different town.  You don't have any friends there.  It passes the time.  And then once you get into your fourth wank, you start thinking to yourself, have I got  five in me?  And then the five one's like a challenge to yourself. 
[02:20:30]  And you're just shooting out that watery, like nothing jizz.  It's just raw at that point, too.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  That's downright depressing that what eventually comes out.  Like, holy shit.  Yeah.  But it's also the lengths you have to go to.  Like, how progressively bad the porn gets.  Like, it starts off with just something very mild.  In the end, you're really looking at rape.  Like, you ever watch porn where you're just sitting there going, I'm not 100% sure this 
[02:21:00]  is legal?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're looking and go, eh.  We've all been there.  Like, you know what is illegal.  You know the shit you can't even go near.  Yeah.  But then there's stuff that where you go, what the fuck is this?  Where they simulate incest.  You know when they do that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's like, but it's still like a 19-year-old girl.  Yeah, yeah.  And she starts using the word dad and all that type of stuff.  And then you start going, is that illegal?  Is this legal?  Because I think it's illegal in general society. 
[02:21:30]  Or animal stuff.  Animal stuff is another one.  There's so much animal porn on the web.  And you're like, eh, there's a girl blowing a dog.  That can't be legal.  What the fuck is that?  And that dog's got a big cock.  I would guess that's illegal.  Is it?  I don't know, though.  If I get my computer cleaned.  I think the act is illegal.  But I don't think watching videos of it is.  But I don't know.  People have whole sites that are dedicated to bestiality.  Yeah.  Doug Stanhope made that point about child pornography being, I've never even stumbled across it. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was saying that, right.  You know what I mean?  I've never even stumbled across it.  So there we go.  Just one click.  We've got a dog fucking a woman.  Oh, and there's another one.  And also, this is Google, by the way.  I'm on Google.  Yeah, this is Google.  This isn't even like.  And here's the argument, right?  If the dog's fucking the woman, is it a bad act?  If the dog comes.  Right.  Who's getting hurt here?  The dog never looks like he's having a bad time.  Yeah.  Who?  You know, it's like also these people who fuck horses, right? 
[02:22:30]  A horse will fucking kick you.  Right there.  Look at this fucking picture.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, I've seen, I've actually, I've seen a couple.  When they do, their mouth just fills with cum when they suck a horse.  Yeah, yeah.  And it just comes shooting out.  It just, there's a lot of it.  Yep.  You've never watched that, Opie?  No, no.  You've never watched some pony sucking videos.  I've never seen, no, a chick blow a horse where her mouth fills up.  No, it doesn't, I'm still proud of that. 
[02:23:00]  It doesn't do anything for me in that sense, but it's one of those things that you got  to kind of look and go, wow, that's fucked up.  Yeah.  Hey, I got something to play.  There's fucked up porn, and then there's jerking off porn.  Yeah.  Jerking off.  But sometimes when that crosses over, you got to fucking reassess your values and go back.  Because you can get stuck in fucked up land.  You've heard, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  You know what I mean?  You've heard our chicken audio, right?  No.  Oh, it's doing it of animals.  This is German, German guy. 
[02:23:30]  The music's great, by the way.  Mach das spas?  Du hÃ¼hnerficker.  Ja, irre.  Ich bin ganz wild auf diese Henne.  Here it goes.  You can tell when the chicken gets it. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  I don't know if it's good.  It's not real, is it?  It's not real, is it?  It's good.  Yeah, it's real.  Oh, no, no.  It's good.  Good.  It's chicken.  What else are we going to do to the chicken?  Crazy fucking kraut.  No wonder they didn't win the war.  Yeah, they're fucking chickens.  Yep.  Look at what they did.  They went from fucking blitzkrieg in their way across Europe to fucking a chicken. 
[02:24:30]  Look at it.  See there?  There you go.  That's the guy fucking a chicken.  It takes help.  This is the thing.  When they bring a chicken to help, I can't get some girls to take a load on the face,  but this guy can get a girl to hold a chicken.  While he fucks it, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Amazing.  That's either love or something higher than that.  And she's a trooper.  She has all her clothes off.  Yeah, she's naked too, just in case he needs a little help.  A little visual. 
[02:25:00]  That's why I always feel, it's that whole thing even with serial killers, right?  Whenever you hear like couples like the West or something, where they go off, like couples  going serial killed together.  Oh yeah, together.  How do you, when does that come up in any relationship?  When do you sit there and you, like you must do it as a joke the first time.  Yeah, yeah, you just go.  I like peanut butter too.  You know what else I like?  Killing people and ravening dead bodies and then just wait to see if they laugh or if  they just sort of give a knowing look.  Yeah, and then you kind of like, yeah, you slowly get into it.  You joke about it a little more. 
[02:25:30]  And then, you know, you're driving down the road, you look at someone and go, we could  you know, pick them up and kill them.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah, we love the Jim Jefferies.  I just wanted to add to that topic on whether or not it's legal to blow a dog.  According to my sister's cock a spaniel, it's okay in New York.  But not in Jersey?  No, not in Jersey.  Danny, this guy's begging us to try out.  I'm going to write it down. 
[02:26:00]  I'm not going to make the same mistake I did at that last site.  Yeah, we usually say it on the air.  We just go, yeah, go to this website.  And then everyone goes to it and it fucking crashes.  So now, fuck you, listeners.  We're waiting.  We'll tell you later.  Maybe.  If we look and see.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Man, I hear there's a free preview.  Oh, boy.  Where are those free previews?  Where is the free preview?  Where is the free preview section?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  That's right.  I didn't hear it.  Yeah, it's all right. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  I can get you a, I know a link to a good blowjob of a horse.  Yeah?  Yeah, somewhere in Mexico.  And it's not nice.  And there's a whole lot of guys staying around watching this guy.  But she takes it inside and then just, it's not pleasant.  Click on one of those down at the bottom there.  It's pay stuff.  It's pay stuff?  Yeah.  Maybe it's preview, though.  That'll blow up our computer.  No.  Video preview.  Oh, video preview. 
[02:27:00]  Oh.  God, shit.  No, down at the bottom it says video preview.  Click on one of those.  Video preview.  Jesus.  Video preview.  I'm lying sacks of shit.  If that's what you want to see, I can get you there.  Well, you know.  That's a little.  I was just seeing if the site worked.  I like how it's like, if that's what you want to see.  No one wants to see it, really.  It's more a strange curiosity.  No.  It's one of those things that I just, I would hate for, like, a girl to walk in and I'm watching it. 
[02:27:30]  Like, you know, I've been caught masturbating several times in my life by maids in hotel rooms and stuff like that.  Oh, you're that guy?  I once had my earphones on.  There was a video online of a guy just, like, over and over again having the maid walk in as he's.  Oh, no.  We had the video on the show.  I didn't do it on purpose.  You're that guy, aren't you?  I once was in this morning.  You're doing the knocking and you're like, ah, let her just come in.  I had my earphones on. 
[02:28:00]  This is back in the day of Discman's, right?  Yeah.  Discman's.  And I'm listening to my Discman.  I'm listening to John Lennon's solo career, right?  So it could have been, like, woman, maybe I was listening to, watching the wheels.  And I was masturbating.  I just sort of halfway through decided to have a wait.  This lady walks in with towels.  This sounds like a sketch, but this actually happened.  This lady walks in with towels.  She screams.  I sort of rip the earphones off.  And she's on the other side of the door going, I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I was just trying to bring up some towels. 
[02:28:30]  I need them.  That's what I was saying.  Oh, you do?  I said, you should stay.  I'm going to need one in a second.  Just in the nick of time, lady.  But it's one of those little tiny hotels in, like, Cornwall in England, like, this little village.  Right?  And it was like, that was the same lady that I had to go and check out with afterwards.  Oh, you filthy animal.  Yeah.  So I went down with my, you know, I've always had a theory on hotels.  The bigger the key, the shit of the hotel.  Yeah.  Like, if you get a key ring that's like a stick that you have to have, that's a shit hotel. 
[02:29:00]  But, yeah, it was one of those ones where I had to go back down and just face her again.  My mother once caught me masturbating when I was young.  And she just stood at the end of the bed while I laid there naked.  I flipped over onto my stomach with, like, my big sweaty ass sitting up.  And she just stood there.  And she actually came in.  It was the middle of the day.  It was like 40 degrees.  It was like 110 Fahrenheit.  Right?  And I was prepping.  I wasn't even in full wake.  Right?  I was just prepping.  Yeah.  I had some porn out like that.  And I did that.  She walked into my room. 
[02:29:30]  Holy shit.  I did that one motion magazine on the side of the bed.  Just, right?  Yeah.  Middle of the afternoon, blistering sun.  I'm laying under my duvet.  Just, hello, mum.  Hello.  She goes, clean your fucking room.  And then I went, I'll be right onto that.  And then she was like, I normally give a smart-ass answer.  So she's like, why are you under the duvet?  It's so really hot.  I went, I'm having a nap.  You haven't had a nap in 10 years.  Oh, shit.  She was onto you.  And then she starts pulling on the duvet, right?  What the fuck?  And so I'm like, please, mum, please. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, God.  And so I've got this 300-pound woman who's got leverage pulling back.  And I'm just sort of holding with my claws up near my chest.  And I've got one chance here, right?  Did you lose your rod?  No.  I was actually strengthening in some ironic way.  And I let go of the duvet just like that.  You know when you're having a tug of war and the only joy you have left in that battle  when you're at a picnic is letting go and watching the other cunts fall over?  Right?  So I let go. 
[02:30:30]  She smashes into the wardrobe.  But in one motion, I flip onto my stomach, right?  So I'm just laying there on an empty mattress with my ass in the air,  covered in fucking sweat.  I'm crying.  I'm about 12 or 13.  I'm bawling my eyes out.  This big fat woman standing under my bed goes, you disgust me.  Now, you'd think that's where it would end, wouldn't you?  It's bad boy Bobby.  You're bad boy Bobby.  She went and told my eldest brother. 
[02:31:00]  Why would she do that?  Because she thought that masturbation, in my house you could say fucking cunt, right?  If you called your brother a jerk, she'd go, that's disgusting, touching yourself in that way.  Right?  She had a real thing about masturbating.  It was creepy.  Right?  And so my brother comes in and I was still that age.  It wasn't like today where kids just talk about masturbating in front of each other.  Yeah, like fuck you.  We were all there going, oh no, I don't do it.  You're a fucking wanker.  I'm not a wanker, you dickhead.  Right?  And so my brother came in and he basically just told me that he'd never done it and that 
[02:31:30]  I should be ashamed and he goes, hopefully granddad won't find out and we won't have  to move.  So I felt horrible for years and then years and years later, we're all together at Christmas.  I'm about 20 years old by this stage and my brother, we're all ragging on each other  at the table and my brother goes, hey, remember when mum caught Jim wanking and then she came  and told me and then dad and my brother high five. 
[02:32:00]  We had him thinking for years, he was the only one.  Oh, shit.  I think the shame that went along with it.  And they just, you know, thought of it as a little joke.  Yeah, yeah.  And meanwhile, you lived with it.  I lived with guilt and paranoia.  Oh, you poor little bastard.  When I was very young, when I was about 10, I used to go to underwear catalogs trying  to find something to wank off to.  Oh, yeah, we all did that.  Yeah, but your mother wasn't 300 pounds.  See, is this the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is a compilation of these. 
[02:32:30]  This is just one of them.  I got to find the other one.  See, yeah, very suspicious, Jim, because a lot of people will let the maid come in as  they're jerking off because that's the excitement there.  See, here you got a guy jerking off and there's the door opening on their maid.  She just freaked in and walked right the fuck out.  So I was going to this underwear catalog and I was in one of my mom's mother's, you know,  women's magazines, which wasn't a pornography magazine, just like a People magazine, right? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  And there was one picture out of nowhere of this naked tit.  Wow.  And I was like, fucking killer.  Peter.  Right?  So I cut it out, wanked off to it for about a year until I saw a documentary on a woman  having a mammogram.  And I was like, the other tit was in a machine.  It ruined it for you?  Yeah.  I was like, oh no, cancer breast.  It ruined it for you?  Yeah.  Shit.  Jesus.  Yeah, I used to find the old Cosmo, Cosmopolitan magazine.  My mother would like, with the breast cream ads. 
[02:33:30]  She had Cosmo.  Remember the breast cream ads in the back?  Oh my God.  All right.  We found the real site with the free preview.  Here we go.  Oh, that is disgusting.  Let's go free preview on this one there.  Highest quality video.  That's disgusting because it's two male animals.  God only knows what's being loaded on the computer.  Loading.  You really need a Mac for this situation.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  We're not going to be able to do anything else on our computers today or tomorrow.  I think it's going to be.  All right.  Here it is. 
[02:34:00]  What the fuck?  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  Oh, Christ.  I mean, oh, no.  Oh, the poor dog.  I want to see the dog's face if he's happy or not.  This is my thing.  The dog is happy.  The dog would kick back, man.  Yeah.  It's a guy doing a dog.  Oh, the dog's turning around looking at him like, what are you doing to me?  What are you doing to me?  It's the dog's just pet.  Yeah, it's a gentleman.  Is it a female dog or is he doing it up the ass?  I think it's in the canon. 
[02:34:30]  I don't know.  It's a female dog.  I have no idea.  Nothing.  Nothing weird.  What he's doing to this.  Yeah, that would be really sick if it was in the ass.  See, I enjoy more when you see the dog fucking the woman because at least you know that it's  the dog's idea.  Yeah.  The dog sniffed.  Had some.  Look at this poor dog.  He's turning around looking at the guy like, are you done?  Like, what the fuck?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  I didn't realize you're fucking me.  I could have had any home.  I had to be brought into yours.  Oh, God.  And the dog walks away in shame.  Like, what now?  The dog was walking sideways. 
[02:35:00]  The thing is also that dog goes, and you really want me to stop criminals?  Yeah, yeah.  People can do anything to me.  I'm not going to fight back.  Break in.  Yeah, somebody breaks in.  That dog's just going to go.  Yeah, he's right over there.  Yeah.  Oh, assume the position.  I like that.  He's got him laying down on his back.  Yeah, that's a big point.  And then there's a cum shot.  Ew, no.  He's not eating the fucking dog.  You know what I like about that?  Holy shit, he's licking the dog.  He's actually doing that dog human style.  Oh.  Yeah, I know.  That was weird.  The dog laying on the back. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, Christ.  Give me a break.  It's just that dog's cocks look so horrible.  That's the problem you got.  Yeah, because the guy was fellating the canine.  Like the vaginas.  They look all chewed up.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like after a real jerk bender.  It looks like after you've been jerking for a weekend.  The parents went away for the weekend and left you home alone for the first time ever.  Yeah.  You're just jerking all over the house. 
[02:36:00]  But it's also, your cock would be red raw if the only way you can masturbate is against the carpet.  But if you haven't got any dexterous fingers or anything and it's just rubbing up against shit, it's going to be fairly teared.  Yeah, it's going to be a little tender.  Yesterday we were talking about self-pleasuring yourself.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, a little self-pleasuring.  I want to play this piece of production.  This will lead to another discussion with Jim Jeffries, who's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long.  Have you ever needed to get your rocks off but lacked the means to do so? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, that's it.  That's, yeah.  Manual masturbation is old school.  How would you like to learn to go down on yourself?  Yeah, suck a dick roll!  We think with practice and stretching, most guys should be able to at least make some mouth-to-cock contact.  The Anthony Cumia Guide to Oral Self-Pleasure will have you gobbling your knob in no time.  You're on your bed on your back.  You flip your legs over your head and you use the wall now to walk down. 
[02:37:00]  You're actually walking down the wall to try to walk the dick into your mouth.  Almost there!  Anthony Cumia's step-by-step instructions will teach you how to cradle the balls, work the shaft, and swallow the gravy like a champ.  Yeah, suck a dick roll!  Is there a money shot?  There better be or this is a total waste of time.  We've seen guys swallow him right to the balls.  Begin reel two.  The Anthony Cumia's Guide to Self-Oral Pleasure isn't gay because you're doing it to yourself.  If you can't get your mouth over your cock the first time, oh, don't be disappointed. 
[02:37:30]  At least that's what you can tell yourself while you're twisted up like a pretzel and your balls are bouncing off your nose.  Yeah, and then more tips.  Stretch before your session.  The last thing you want to do is crack your spine mid-fellatio, lose all bowel control, and crap all over your face.  It's more comfortable and your stomach contents won't get in the way when you double over.  The Anthony Cumia Guide to Oral Self-Pleasure can be yours for the low, low price of $9.95.  Self-sucking doesn't come naturally to everyone. 
[02:38:00]  So take it slow, work with what you've got, and try to have fun.  And try to have fun.  There you go.  I knew reading that would bite me in the ass.  That's pretty good.  Didn't you get that script and go, I think they're playing a trick on me.  No, no, I was reading off a website on how to self-folate yourself.  Yeah, self-folate.  And, yeah, I was reading that yesterday.  And, of course, they took it, as they usually do, out of context and made it like I was saying it. 
[02:38:30]  See, I was just reading this.  You walk down the wall.  Yeah, you walk down the wall.  See, there's a method.  See, the guy's sitting.  It's a whole website.  And then there's the walk down the wall.  And then there's the sitting and, yeah, holding the back of the legs.  And then there's that one, which is, I don't even know how the fuck he does that.  Jim, which way would you try?  Well, as you said earlier, I need to do some sit-ups.  So my gut would get in the way. 
[02:39:00]  But I'd probably do the walk down the wall.  Walk down the wall.  Because, you know, there's some bed.  There's some comfort.  I don't have to get up in the morning to do that.  Yeah.  Helps with depression.  And you're using gravity to help you.  Yeah.  The weight of your lower part of your body is now just driving that cock right into your mouth.  Also, then I can imagine I'm just having 69 with another man, which makes it, you know.  A little easier to suck a dick.  If I'm just bending over, it doesn't feel like it's been forced upon me. 
[02:39:30]  Which one would break your neck, kid?  I don't think any of them would break your neck as such.  I don't know.  I think the third one.  The third one looks really bad for me.  That looks like that could be a problem.  No, that looks like breaking your spine.  Your lower spine.  I think the walk up the wall is bad for your neck.  That could be a problem.  Let's be honest.  It's all bad for you.  Because, you know, something.  It doesn't matter how you do it.  The illustration shows the gentleman bent right below the rib cage is where his body  is now bending so his dick can go into his mouth. 
[02:40:00]  But we all know that the neck takes the brunt of the bend.  Don't we all know?  No?  Just me?  Just me that gave it a whirl in my more limber years?  If you ever watch Ron Jeremy do it, he doesn't bend very much at all in that famous footage  of him doing it.  That's how he got famous, wasn't it?  He was the guy who used to suck his own dick.  But he's really just that much.  Just kind of getting a little in the...  And he can't do it now because he's too fat, isn't he?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:40:30]  He'd be a mess.  Let's say hi to Bob in Connecticut.  Isn't that funny that Bob is calling?  Yeah.  Bob.  He's talking over all the laughter.  So I...  Bob.  Sorry about that.  We didn't hear you.  Go ahead.  Didn't mean to interrupt your show.  I'm sorry.  Why don't you know if the dogs in the video were begging to be adopted by Michael Vick?  Yeah.  No shit.  Who's Michael Vick?  Sick shit.  You don't know who Michael Vick is?  No.  Oh.  It's that American football. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, he's the guy who...  The dog fighting guy.  Right.  And he's back.  Yeah, yeah.  I think he's back in after three games.  I think that's it.  Playing with the Eagles.  Sits out three more games.  He's playing football again.  Was it just that he had a whole heap of dogs fighting each other?  I don't know.  It was a long, involved story, Jim Jeffries.  Yeah.  But he did his time.  Yeah.  So the man, you know, he paid the time for his crime or whatever the people say.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I'm trying to get jiggy.  We're going to take a break.  We got guests to sound as we go into break, though, I see, Danny.  Yeah, it's not exactly such a hard one, but we all thought it was funny enough that we  should bring it to you guys.  All right.  Let's check this out.  Well, it's more like Guess Who's sound, I guess.  Guess Who's sound?  Guess Who?  We're playing Guess Who bit of sounds.  I love Guess Who.  Oh.  Oh, I know that's someone having a shit. 
[02:42:00]  That's a shit plug coming out.  Is that somebody we know?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's someone that we, maybe not Jim knows, but it's someone that  we all know.  Sure.  Wow.  Normally.  Well, I would not know him.  I'm a nice guy.  I'm pretty affable.  Yeah.  I would guess it's you, Danny.  It is not me.  It's Norton.  I would normally think Jim Norton.  It is not Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Is it George from Otto and George?  No. 
[02:42:30]  It's one of the guys.  Yeah.  That works on the show.  D-boy?  D-boy.  It is D-boy.  It's D-boy.  D-boy.  Fucking Derek.  He likes to tape his own shit sounds.  Can we hear that again?  That was a good one.  Yeah.  Can we hear that again?  Sounds like a cue ball coming loose.  You can hear the plugs.  Yeah.  Just from that sound, you know the exact length and size of the shit. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You can picture it.  Yeah.  That was a round one.  Boom.  That must be like how blind people see things through hearing.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly the same way.  You can listen to that and know exactly what it looks like.  It wasn't long.  It wasn't a floater.  Yeah.  There we go.  It sounds like the sound effect when the guy at the saloon spits his chew into the spittoon.  Derek also said that the voice notes function of his iPhone is his favorite thing because 
[02:43:30]  he can record the sounds of his own dumps.  That's what he used?  The iPhone?  Yep.  That was voice notes.  Picks up pretty nicely.  He emails it to me with the file name is Memo.  That should be the ad for the iPhone.  One more time here.  Apple iPhone.  He stops me in the hallway before.  He goes, you can hear my asshole opening up. 
[02:44:00]  He's all excited.  Do you ever do a shit, right, and you know it's really long, like it's a long shit, and  you assume it's still dangling off your ass, so you sort of squat up slightly and see if  you can see it dangling.  If you can see it dangling.  I've been there.  Yeah.  If you can actually still see it dangling and attach, that's really long because there's  like levels.  I've been there.  Yeah.  And you know.  You want to clip it loose or clean up.  It's going to be a fucking nightmare.  I'm like interested.  I'm like, that's like fucking a foot hanging out my ass. 
[02:44:30]  Because the American toilets.  You've got to give credit to the Americans on this one, man.  You guys and your high water levels.  Sometimes I don't even hear a kaplunk.  It just sort of drifts straight in.  It just drifts in.  Oh, really?  You guys got low water levels?  Everywhere else in the world has this low water level where you actually hear a splash.  Really?  We don't like splash back.  I love that.  And also, everyone else sort of like pushes the water above it and out through the cistern,  right, out through the S-Bend.  Yeah.  Where you guys just sort of suck it away. 
[02:45:00]  Best toilets in the world.  And if you go to a hotel anywhere in Britain and you smoke all day and you've got a cup  full of cigarette buds and you want to act like you haven't been smoking, and so you  throw it down the toilet, they won't flush in Europe.  You actually have to get your hand and sort of shove it under the S-Bend to do it.  Holy shit, really?  Or you've got to roll them in paper and make the toilet think that it's...  You've got to confuse the toilet.  You've got to fake the toilet out.  Yeah, you've got to go, oh, no, there's no cigarette buds in there.  Nothing that floats.  That's just toilet paper.  You can flush that.  Oh, my God.  Where in America, they'll just take it away, man. 
[02:45:30]  Kill a few dolphins or wherever it goes.  I don't know where it goes.  Oh, my God.  But I'm a big fan of the American toilets.  Big fan.  Love it.  Have you ever been to the ones in Germany where they've got the shelf?  No, what's that?  Oh, Google the German shelf toilets.  They've got this shelf that's got a little thin puddle of water where you shit on top,  right?  No, no, not like that.  Not like that.  Go German toilet.  I'm just showing you what American toilets are.  Oh, right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I've seen this one. 
[02:46:00]  That's like 10 golf balls.  19 golf balls being sucked into this new toilet.  19 golf balls being sucked into this new toilet.  Yeah, just sit down the fucking toity.  Well, the Germans are such disgusting bastards that they have this shelf because they're really  interested in looking in their poos.  It's sort of like you look through your shit and then it flushes it off the shelf and down  the ledge.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, there it is.  There it is.  There it is.  Oh.  So, okay.  Here it is.  I don't get it.  The toilet actually has a shelf.  A landing area.  So, what you're doing is shitting on just dry fucking toilet ledge. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, and they'll flush it off the ledge into that little hole, but your arsehole isn't  over that hole.  It's over the shelf.  No, no.  It's over like porcelain.  Yeah.  It's like just a piece of porcelain.  With less than an inch of water.  That's got to leave a lot of smears in the toilet.  No.  What the fuck is that thing?  What's the thing that pops out?  That thing pops out and it will spray around the bowl and everything and make sure it's  clean.  Oh, get rid of the smears?  Yeah.  That's a dumb toilet.  But they're all through Germany.  That's a dumb one.  It's like you're on acid.  But the thing is, it's when in Rome, I'm there fucking poking through my shit with like 
[02:47:00]  a stick.  Just, oh.  Because you've never seen your shit up so high and not covered in water.  I'm like, I'm like, yeah, this is exciting for me.  Is there anything worse than a shit that pops out of the water, though?  Yeah.  Oh, my.  That is fucked and all.  Our human feces.  Our human feces smells horrific.  So the Germans got to be smelling their own shit all day long.  Yeah, yeah, that's terrible.  The Germans are obsessed with shit.  They love shit.  Whenever they make jokes about scat porn, it's always the Germans, you know, and the Japanese. 
[02:47:30]  They love shit.  I don't get the scat porn either.  No, I don't get that.  That, I don't fucking guess.  No, there's nothing sexy about that.  A few times in my life, I've had anal sex with a girl where afterwards, a bit of poo's  gone, kapunk, out afterwards.  Oh, shit.  I had this girlfriend I used to watch a lot of porn with.  You know what, like, ATM, ass to mouth, right?  You like watching that in porn.  There's something sexy about that, right?  Right?  But you know, like, the girls in porn, they've had their assholes, like, flushed out.  Like, people have just been in there just, like, cleaning all day. 
[02:48:00]  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  And they haven't eaten anything before a scene, so they can take their...  I had this girlfriend who got really into watching porn, and she wanted to do everything  that porn's nose did.  And she pulled my cock out of her ass, and I knew, I knew in that second, I hadn't even  had to touch it, there was a little bit of shit on my cock.  Oh, God damn it.  She put it into her mouth.  And you know that scene when Stewie starts sucking off Peter's nipple?  Yeah.  And he just does that look of...  Yeah, there you go. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, fucking Danny.  Danny will find anything.  Oh, wow.  Shit on my dick.  It's not the right audio.  Shit on my penis.  Oh.  Yeah, it's...  A new low for the radio show.  Wonderful.  Sorry, is that me?  Sorry.  No, it's all good.  Trust me.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Jim Jeffries is going to be at Caroline's tonight through Sunday.  Tickets are going to sell well, I believe, for this.  I think it will sell better than last time, but you never know you're lucky in a big city. 
[02:49:00]  212-757-4100, and the DVD for I Swear to God will be out October 19th.  That got very good reviews, Jim.  October 19th.  Yeah, 13th.  I don't know.  It's coming out.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hang on.  Wait for it.  There it goes.  Yeah, that's...  No, a little bit of jizz coming out of her ass.  That's all right.  That's all right.  Damn it.  How much did she just hate her...  Yeah, yeah, that's... 
[02:49:30]  God damn it.  But that's what happens in reality.  In porn, that doesn't happen.  That's what happens in reality.  She really hated Daddy.  Oh!  Butterscotch.  Butterscotch.  Butterfucking scotch.  But it is.  It works like a plunger.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, in the few times when I was younger, when I put a couple of things up my ass for  masturbate, I was like, those days are over.  Tub girl.  Tub girl.  Tub girl.  That's so sick.  Bob! 
[02:50:00]  That is one of the greatest still motion photographs.  The tub girl birthday cake rules.  There used to be this guy in Sydney, I don't know if there'd be pictures of him, he was  called the trough junkie, like we call the trough, the urinal trough, right?  And this guy was, he used to go to the sleaze ball, which was a big thing after the gay  Mardi Gras.  This guy would just be in a gimp mask, just laying in the urinal trough.  He's dead now, like from the whole alphabet of hepatitis.  And he used to, he used to lay in this trough and just piss on me, piss on me with a real 
[02:50:30]  like broad and straight.  And the thing is you first go in there and you're like, I'm not going to piss on you,  man.  I'm just going to.  And then in the end you're like, ah, fuck it.  I'll just piss on him.  As long as he doesn't touch me.  Then you're pissing on his tongue and all.  But he's laying in a trough where like thousands of people are urinating that day.  It's a big outdoor party.  Holy shit.  And he's just sweet.  Happy is Larry.  Couldn't be happier.  Happy is Larry.  What does that say?  Happy is Larry.  Larry is just a saying.  He's very happy. 
[02:51:00]  Larry was the guy who was historically happy.  Yeah.  Happy is Larry.  I need his shirt.  And he just lay there just with glee.  That is somebody who just loves degradation.  Oh, fucking yeah.  Cannot get degraded enough.  Quick break.  Jim Jeffries, Caroline's all weekend long.  212-757-4100.  I want to see if Travis is paying attention.  What will Travis play as we go to break here?  Oh.  The pressure is on.  Oh, Travis.  What do you got, Travis?  I have ONA into spots number five. 
[02:51:30]  Nope.  No, no, no.  No, no.  Nope.  And the only reason I bring this up, don't look at instant feedback.  Everyone has what you should be playing going into break.  That pitch is just...  Want to try again?  Don't help him out.  Well, I just went to the bathroom, so maybe I missed something.  Oh, did you?  You missed some of the best anal sex shit conversation you're going to hear.  It's a song.  Oh.  All right.  Wait, please hold.  Hang on.  All right. 
[02:52:00]  Please hold.  You guys never play songs.  This is very exciting.  This song rules.  This guy has passion.  He's really into singing this particular song.  Oh, wait.  Uh-oh.  What?  Not that one.  Oh, wow.  I'm confused now.  I know there's two.  I think I know which one you want.  Can I write it down?  All right.  I'll write it down at the same time.  Where's the pattern?  Is it a famous song?  Uh, okay.  Hold on.  Give me the marker. 
[02:52:30]  It's not like ACDC.  I'm going to write this down.  Don't look.  Jim, why don't you play it, too?  Write down a song.  All right.  Okay.  It's got to be something about fucking something in the ass.  Okay.  I got it.  I got mine written down.  Do we have a match?  Yeah.  We have a match.  All right.  I'm not going to read it out loud.  It's a song parody.  That's a song parody.  And it's a parody of which song, Travis? 
[02:53:00]  It's a parody of which song?  Which song, Travis?  Oh, I don't know the original song.  I have the song you want.  You sure?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely positive.  Positive.  Willing to bet your job on it?  No.  I have a baby.  I'm not betting my job on anything.  But we do know it's based on a real song, so I think we might have a match with Travis  now, too.  Oh, okay.  I know the name of the original song.  But Danny's whispering it to you through the glass. 
[02:53:30]  No.  It's hard to do through the glass.  What were you going to play?  Yeah.  What were you going to play?  Hit it for two seconds.  Hang on.  Always panic.  What were you going to play?  You fucking not knowing what we were talking about.  Yeah.  I wouldn't get used to keeping that kid, man.  You're not doing that good a job.  I know.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, seriously.  If I hit it, I would lose it.  So, hang on.  Here's what I'm going to play.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Stop now.  That's the one.  Oh, yeah.  We built this city on rock and roll.  So, yeah.  I bet we got it.  No, that's what I was going to play.  But if I hit it, I would have lost it in the thing that I have right now. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  So, we're going to play this as we go to break.  More with Jim Jeffries.  My dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole.  Dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole. 
[02:54:30]  It looks just like a black man's, but not quite as thick. 
[02:55:00]  Your coolant needs a diaper.  Cause I'm in your cold and blue.  Now that dirty hands work.  And my dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole.  My dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole.  Dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole. 
[02:55:30]  It's the Teddy Mountain Highway.  Rollin' along.  Teddy Mountain Highway. 
[02:56:00]  Singin' my soul.  Rollin' in the studio.  Jimmy on my back.  Over in the air.  Won't cut me no slack.  On the Teddy Mountain Highway.  Singin' my soul.  Daddy's head's up.  Send him down.  Travis going bald.  Steve's going gay.  On the Teddy Mountain Highway.  I'm singin' this song. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  Bob Kennedy.  Shit.  You fucked me up.  You're gonna really fuck your voice up.  Am I really?  Oh yeah.  It'd be fuckin' great if I had no voice for my shows.  Because I'm fuckin' singin'.  The Teddy Mountain Highway.  My voice is gone. 
[02:57:00]  On the Teddy Mountain Highway.  Singin' my song.  Another inane show song stuck in my fuckin' head all day.  Anthony loves when I sing this song.  He wants to tap his feet right along.  On the Teddy Mountain Highway.  Playing the song.  All right, Bobby.  Now's a good time to break the big news. 
[02:57:30]  You're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus, Sirius 197, XM-202.  I didn't like that one.  Stupid Bobby.  It was the fact that he was freestyling.  Yeah, he was.  Was that Bobby?  Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it was Norton.  But you can't tell that.  It's a bit catchy.  Yeah.  Jim Jeffries in studio.  Caroline's all weekend long starting tonight through Sunday.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-HONDRED.  Want to change gears slightly and ask Jim Jeffries about healthcare?  Because the guy has lived in three countries now, right? 
[02:58:00]  Ah, true.  Yes.  I'm all for public healthcare.  I think it's wonderful.  Ew.  I think Australians got it more down pat than the British do.  Because the Australians just, they keep tabs on it a bit more.  So they give you a little card, like a Medicare card.  And then you can go into the doctor's surgery and just show your card.  And then the government has a little bit of a history of when you went to the doctor  and how much you've taken out of the system and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then you can't do it if you're a tourist or on holidays or something like that. 
[02:58:30]  You've got to get your private holiday healthcare cover.  But in England, fucking bonus, man.  They just take anyone.  Really?  I got my head fractured in a comedy club.  Someone came up and smashed my head into a table.  Actually, someone wants to talk about that.  How long ago was that?  Not when I got punched in the comedy club.  This is a separate incident.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah.  This one was never caught on film.  Okay.  But you've seen the footage of me getting punched, haven't you?  Yeah.  Ryan in Kansas City once asked about that as well. 
[02:59:00]  That was a good one.  I got punched.  What happened with that?  I'll tell this story again if you want.  But all that happened was I was doing a gig.  It was going reasonably well.  There was 10% of the audience wished ill on my life.  And this woman kept on going and going.  I kept on putting her down, putting her down, putting her down.  And then my closing line, which is my line, but it sounds like it's an old line, was I'm going to leave you alone now like your dad did.  Right?  Which is a nice little comedy jibe.  Sure, yeah.  Melt her. 
[02:59:30]  Anyone?  And then I said, it's a shame your grandfather never did.  That's why you seek so much attention in public.  Oh.  Right?  Now, there was a guy on the other side of the room that had some issues with his father or grandfather.  And he decided, I'm going to punch that cunt in the head.  But he was an Irish lad.  And he decided, I'll do it when I finish my beverage.  So I was in the middle of my just cunt material.  And he finished his drink.  And then he sort of dusted his hands off.  And he ran up and punched me.  So there's a whole thing.  A lot of comics get threatened in comedy clubs.  A lot of times you'll be doing a gig and someone will stand up and just go, oh, you keep speaking like that. 
[03:00:00]  But this guy, it's like assassinating someone.  If you say, I've got a gun, I'm going to shoot you.  You know, you'll get tackled.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you just shoot the guy, you know, the guy's dead.  You know.  And so this guy just ran up and started punching me.  And I didn't even know I was in a fight.  I just took a couple of blows to the head.  And I actually tried to reason with him while he was punching me.  Like, oh, you're not allowed up here.  Hey, what are you doing up here punching me?  I think the exact time I was, oh, hang on, fella.  Like that.  Hang on, fella.  You're like, I can't believe the imaginary wall didn't hold him back. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And then I'm supposed to come up here.  Exactly.  How dare you jump over all these broken barriers, my edgy comediers.  And so the audience rushed to my assistance and started just beating this guy up.  And I actually, about a year ago, I get an email from his brother apologizing about what  his brother did.  And he goes, but I'd also like to say, and then I go, that's all right, mate.  And then he goes, I've just been watching online.  He goes, you've profited out of this.  You've put this on web pages and stuff like that. 
[03:01:00]  How fucking dare you?  Who the hell do you think you are?  Like that.  I sent back an email that went, mate, the cops are giving me three years to press charges.  So how about you send me this email in two years' time?  Because I never pressed charges on the guy because I was like, I'm going to make money  out of this, first of all, because it's going to raise my popularity because it'll get on  the internet.  It'll be a big thing.  Yeah, a lot of people have checked it out.  And also, fucking hell, man.  If I got, if, you know, we all act like a cunt every now and again. 
[03:01:30]  Everyone's gotten drunk and done something stupid.  I chatted to the lad afterwards and he seemed like a fairly reasonable young bloke.  And he was, he just couldn't believe what he'd done.  He's like completely like, what did I, what was I thinking?  I just ran on stage.  I was hammered.  Yeah, yeah.  He was just completely hammered.  And you know, it's not that funny a story.  It's a good story though.  Well, it leads to the other one.  You fractured your skull.  I fractured my skull in a comedy club.  That was actually, I had a really good gig.  Someone else hit you?  Yeah, yeah.  I had a really good gig.  Nothing happened.  The gig was fine. 
[03:02:00]  Someone got caught talking in the comedy club, unbeknown to me, and the comedy club had  done this thing.  Hey, you keep talking, get kicked out.  So in his drunken mind, he was like, oh, he's the reason I've been kicked out.  Even though I didn't even have a heckling.  You had no idea.  I had no idea.  The guy got kicked out and then they go, I will let you back in for the nightclub.  It's one of these comedy clubs that turns into a nightclub afterwards.  And they let him back in and he stumbled back up the stairs, saw me talking to somebody  and just came behind, grabbed me by the back of the hair and smashed me into a table.  And I was concussed.  And I woke up on a fucking, on a stretcher being put into an ambulance like this long 
[03:02:30]  ago with a whole lot of these girls that are on a bachelorette night in fucking bunny  years, just staring at me.  Oh my God.  And like just that creepy heaven, like fucking hell, man.  What's happened?  And, and, uh, and one of the girls, this is what she says.  She looks down and she goes, um, she goes, she goes, well, we thought you were funny.  And like, that was the big concern.  Do people still find me funny when you're fucking laying there? 
[03:03:00]  So I, I go into hospital and, and, um, Jeffries, Jeffries isn't even my real surname.  It's my middle name.  So, so, you know, stages, showbiz, all that bullshit.  And, uh, so I go into hospital in Britain, still concussed under my stage name.  Right?  No one says anything.  No one checks any ID.  They have me in there for three days.  They actually put me in a ward that should have been called drunken cunts who have gotten  in trouble ward.  Just a lot of bar injuries.  Just a lot of like guys with like a glass sticking out of his head. 
[03:03:30]  A lot of people who are in bed, but with like cops standing at the end of the bed.  Trying to get some answers.  Right?  Waiting to get, and like, like people being quizzed when they just pull that curtain across in  between you.  Like what?  Bit of privacy.  All right.  So the, uh, the woman, she's not waking up, but when she does wake up, we're going to  get some answers.  You know what I mean?  There's one other guy that was just like, fuck it.  I'm smoking, mate.  I'm fucking smoking.  If it's, I don't care if it's a hospital. 
[03:04:00]  He's just, you know, cracking off.  And they didn't, didn't, didn't even ask for ID or anything.  It was about, there was about 10 of us in the room.  And I think there was a, there was two guys who had actually beaten each other up and they  were on separate corners, still yelling abuse with a cop standing in the middle of the  room and I'm just there with my fractured skull going, can you all be quiet?  I've got a headache.  I've got a show tomorrow and I've got a headache.  I actually went and did a gig a few days later and I still like slightly like concussed.  They reckon I was just, just gibberish was coming out of my mouth. 
[03:04:30]  It was a little off.  Yeah.  What happens when you fracture a skull is I didn't, it's not the bit they hit.  It's the softest part of the skull.  It's, it's this bit that normally goes.  Oh.  That bit, because it's like, it's pointing between your eyes.  Yeah, it's, it's that, that's where the fragile bit of the skull, not, not for everybody.  Sometimes it is.  And that's where you've fractured?  Yeah, my, my own fracture there.  God damn.  But it, it, it, it just healed up.  It's just cracked.  But I, I, uh.  Like above the bridge of the nose and.  I, I was, I was on the ambulance with like a headache that you'd fucking, I thought I was 
[03:05:00]  about the hemorrhage and just fucking just, that's it.  Just done.  Yeah.  And, like, allegedly it was one of those fold-up tables and the impact of my head made  the whole table just collapse down as well, which is probably for the best, you know.  Could have been worse.  And, and, uh.  A mess.  Yeah, just a mess.  What happened to the guy?  That was in Nottingham.  Um, he got, this is the weird thing, he got a, a tremendous kicking off the security  staff and everything there.  Oh yeah, they nailed him.  And then, and then the comedy club was sort of like, Jim, um, I go, I want to press fucking 
[03:05:30]  charges on that guy.  I want to press charges.  And then they went, Jim, can we show you the surveillance camera?  Oh, okay.  And then I went, right, right.  And they go, we'll get in a bit of trouble if you do call the cops.  And then they sort of went to me, uh, and so the government was very good with it.  They, uh, because, uh, if you get hurt in a situation like that, they just gave me 2,000  pounds, just said, sorry about our citizen who hit you.  Jesus Christ.  Sorry about that. 
[03:06:00]  And that money.  They call me a victim of crime.  They went, two grand.  All right.  There you go.  Sorry.  Sorry.  They look you in the eye.  Un-fucking-believable.  That's a grand.  Like, will I take care of this?  Yeah.  Sorry about that, mate.  Three?  Wow.  They go higher than three, though.  They do that there?  They'll fucking toss your cash?  I got some money for that.  I got some money.  I told that story a long time ago when I got the break-in where the guy cut me, came  into the house.  Right, yeah, yeah.  I got only a grand for that.  They give you, like, victim pay?  For broken bones is worth a bit more. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, holy shit.  Victim of crime.  Victim of crime.  Where does that money come from?  The taxpayers?  Yeah, I could have gotten about eight grand off the break-in if I went to the psychiatrist  just once and cried a bit and just went, I can't sleep.  But I just never did it.  That's an easy payday.  What's wrong with you?  I know, but I feel like a bit of a, you know, I dealt with it pretty good.  Like, the whole thing with the break-in with the guy coming with the hammer and the guy  with the machete and all that, that was pretty fucking scary.  But in the grand scheme of things, I haven't gone to war, have I? 
[03:07:00]  You know what I mean?  It makes a point.  Like, it's that whole thing, like, a couple of, like, you know, 50 years ago, you'd be  holding your mate's head in a helmet going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, and the government  would be like, well, well done there.  Here's a little bit of ribbon with a bit of metal on the end for bravery.  Right?  Fuck the metals.  Jolly good job, boy.  That's what I always look at those metals, those guys that have 50 metals. 
[03:07:30]  Like, each one of these metals is for going through a battle or doing something fucking  awesome, right?  You see those old blokes, like, killing, like, five Nazis.  Jeez, there's a metal for you.  I even look at that about Olympic athletes.  It's like, some guy gets really good at pole vaulting, and you're like, really?  And in the end, you get just a round disc?  Yeah, a medal.  Is there money?  When you get a gold medal at the Olympics, is there money?  I don't think so.  No, there's, like, endorsements now, but they don't pay you to win.  There's some things that never get endorsements.  Yeah, most of the people that win the medals, they don't get shit. 
[03:08:00]  No, no, no.  Only a handful get actual endorsements out of their achievements.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Most of the medal winners you forget about a month later.  Yeah, the sport, the sport, it's like, if you come fifth in the 100 meters, you're the  fifth fastest man on earth.  There's no money in that, is there?  No, nothing.  And that's, like, one of the most important events.  Yeah, the fifth most.  Speaking of sports, what do you know about cricket?  I love cricket.  Well, cricket is blown up in this country.  It's not blown up.  They had a fucking article in the paper that there's, like, cricket leagues all over New 
[03:08:30]  York City.  Shit, man.  Oh, I bet you that's just expats.  That's just British people and Australian people.  Oh, I've seen, I've seen, no, it's a lot of Caribbean guys.  You've seen them in the parks.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're taking over the parks.  Yeah, West Indies.  With their cricket shit.  In Central Park and shit.  It's the second most popular sport in the world.  Why, though?  Because India are into it.  I try to figure it out.  They're one-sixth of the population, and that's the only sport they play.  I don't get it.  What are you supposed to do?  It looks like baseball, but it's not.  No, it's nothing like baseball.  It's a slightly more skilled game than baseball on the account that there's different forms 
[03:09:00]  of bowling.  The ball bounces.  You're working off a pitch.  It's a five-day game, right?  This is what you've got to remember.  Each game goes for five days.  Five days.  Five days, and it will probably end in a draw.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that horrible?  Who has time for that shit?  When did they cut off the beer?  After the fourth day?  They used to play back like 80 years ago.  They used to just play, we play the game until it finishes. 
[03:09:30]  12 days or something.  There'd be some cunt that would just.  Why does it take so long?  Why can't they do it in an afternoon?  Yeah, what the fuck?  They also have one-day cricket.  They had to make it more exciting.  One day's too long.  Half a day.  One day's, they've got 20-20, which is still half a day, but that's the smallest one,  but it's not very good, half a day.  One day cricket's all right.  Why isn't half a day good?  Because you can't get everyone out in that time, so everyone's just trying to slog it  over the fence.  There's no real skill to it.  Test cricket's where it's at.  The five-day game is tactically one of the most exciting things. 
[03:10:00]  You know, it's all about what's going to happen the next day and whether they'll declare  and there's guys you can make.  I have no clue what this game is about.  That would take five fucking days.  Like, let's say you score a hundred runs, right?  You get a century, right?  That's called a century.  Yeah.  A hundred runs.  You get like Don Bradman, I think, got 352 and a guy called Mark Taylor also got 352.  Why does the score have to be so high?  That took him three days to do that, right? 
[03:10:30]  Why does the score have to be so high?  Because you keep batting until you get out.  So fucking catch the ball.  Why can't people get him out?  What does it take to get somebody out?  All right.  Roll the runner out and move on to the next guy.  You have a thing.  Catch it with your asshole?  Behind you, you have three sticks.  Three sticks.  Yeah, I've seen that.  They're called the stumps.  And then on top of it, they have these things called the bales.  What's that?  Little tiny sticks that rest on top of the sticks.  Yeah.  Right?  And your idea is to knock these things off, right? 
[03:11:00]  So there's several ways you can do it.  You can bowl a ball directly into it and that'll knock it off.  If someone puts their leg directly in front of it and the ball's coming directly at it  and it's below the knee roll so it wouldn't bounce over, the umpire can go, that would  have hit the stumps.  So that's out as well.  You can catch the ball.  You can get caught behind if you just chip it.  The guy behind can catch it.  You can also, you have a crease that you have to stand in, right?  And if you go out of that crease, the guy behind, the wicketkeeper can catch it and  then smash your bales off, right? 
[03:11:30]  That doesn't happen very often.  That's stupid.  And then you can get run out where you have to run back and forth for each one of your  runs.  That's so dumb.  And then you also got, this is how you score your runs.  It's baseball for a retarded.  You can get six runs if you hit it over the fence.  What fence?  The fence where the people are sitting.  What do you mean?  It's like a home run.  The boundary.  Is there an out of bounds?  That's the fence.  Yeah.  Is there a foul pole?  No, no foul pole.  It's round.  What do you mean it's round?  They play in an oval.  So everything is fair no matter where it goes. 
[03:12:00]  No matter where it goes.  Everywhere around you is fair.  That's dumb.  They play on an oval.  It's like fucking mongoloid baseball.  It's baseball in the round.  Let's see a bit of footage of this, right?  Yeah.  Where Travis has just pulled up.  All right.  So you see here, you can hit it anywhere there.  It's a very big area.  It says England leads by 45 runs.  No, that's nothing.  That's nothing.  Apparently.  How do you hit it behind you?  There you go.  It says chipped off him.  Oh, okay.  What is that?  It sounds like he's the commentator. 
[03:12:30]  That's great.  Now you've got different things.  You've got, that's a pace baller.  Uh-huh.  So now the guy with the bat is trying to defend the fucking.  He's trying to defend it.  Now that's a pace.  That guy's just bowling quick.  A guy called Glenn McGrath, right?  He was a very good pace baller.  Then you've got guys like spin bowlers.  They do it slowly, but they flick it.  Now this thing that they're bowling on, this strip, right, is called the wicket, right?  And over the days, all it is, is they just put a bit of tar, like a bit of tarpaulin over  the grass. 
[03:13:00]  That's just a dried up bit of grass.  Right.  They make all the rest of the grass really nice.  They make that bit into shit, right?  And over the day, cracks will emerge and it'll get really, like, you can shove your car keys  in them, like proper cracks, right?  And the idea is to bowl it at the cracks so it might go in all different directions.  Oh, kind of use it.  Yeah.  Now the guy throwing the ball, I guess.  It's a harder ball than a baseball.  It's more solid.  He's trying to knock down the sticks.  Yeah, knock down the sticks.  He might just try to bowl it at his head or something. 
[03:13:30]  Why the fuck is the up in the way?  Now what's the guy with the...  No, he's standing at the other end.  What other end?  There's two batsmen out at a time.  Oh, okay.  And they'll run back and forth, you see.  Oh, I got you.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, and you get ten batsmen and you get two innings.  And, like, each batsman can get, like, up to, like, 300 runs if he's any good, you  know, but...  What about the fans?  What about the fans?  Do they get tickets for all five days?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Or sometimes...  You have to spend a week at a baseball game?  So stupid.  And you start at ten. 
[03:14:00]  Monday through Friday.  You start at...  It goes from ten till six.  It's an eight-hour day.  That's a long day.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Eight hours.  And it's blisteringly hot.  Oh, you get drunk.  Now what happens if you knock down the fucking sticks?  He's out.  Well, you bring another batsman in.  We've got ten of them.  You get ten outs.  Well, you get nine outs because there's two at a time.  Okay.  Because the last guy can't stay out by himself.  Right.  What?  So...  So he's not out if he...  Put Shane Warne, bowl of the century. 
[03:14:30]  Put Shane Warne.  I'll show you.  This is the best, best bowl that anyone's ever done.  How can we tell?  Because I'm going to explain it to you.  And what's a wicked googly?  A googly is a ball that goes the other way.  So spin ball will go that way.  Googly will go that way.  So it looks like it's coming out of the hand that way.  Shane Warne.  Not Ward.  Not Ward.  Warne.  W-A-R-N-E.  There we go.  Ball of the century.  Here we go.  Look at this.  Look at this fucking thing, man.  Look at this.  All right.  We're watching Shane Warne. 
[03:15:00]  Ball of the century.  This guy's the greatest bowler ever.  Like, he's like the Michael Jordan of cricket.  And you can tell?  It's ESPN, the legends of cricket.  The use of leg spin bowling was becoming a lost art at test level.  See how he was out of his...  No, I don't see nothing.  That makes sense.  In 1991.  Oh!  Straight through his legs.  I don't get what I just saw.  I don't understand.  And this guy...  We're trying to develop a myriad of spin variations.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Going on to bowl what was to be described as the ball of the century.  Oh! 
[03:15:30]  I have no idea.  It went through the bat and the pack.  I don't...  But it bounced there and then it ended up there.  I don't understand what we just saw.  For real.  The guy...  The guy with the...  Look how much it moves.  I don't have Australia's...  The guy with the bat thing is like the goalie.  He's defending the sticks.  He's like the batter.  Like, yeah, the same way they do.  His job is to fucking defend the sticks.  Defend the sticks and make runs as well.  And make runs.  So if he smacks that fucking thing...  Yeah.  But it doesn't go out of the park... 
[03:16:00]  He can still run back and forth.  He can run back and forth and do what?  Each time he runs the distance.  Like, the other batsman has to do it as well.  So they have to go...  One...  One, two...  Okay, so he's making runs.  Right.  So you can do like...  You can basically get three...  Until what happens?  Until they hit the sticks.  No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  They're running back and forth.  They're running back and forth.  When do they stop running?  Well, they stop running because if you're caught running there and someone hits the sticks and you're  not back in your crease, you're out.  So what?  When it looks like they could hit your sticks, you better get back and... 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, somebody's gonna...  The slot.  So you knocked the ball somewhere.  Yeah.  So somebody went and got the ball.  Yeah.  And now he's running.  He wants to get those fucking sticks.  Yeah, he wants to get those sticks.  But you're running back and forth and you look and you go, I better get back to my sticks.  In the same way that you've got to reach the bag in baseball before the other guy gets there.  Don't compare this to baseball, my friend.  I'm getting...  I kind of understand that part of it.  All right.  Now...  Holy shit.  There we go.  See, when they wear the colored clothes like that, this is one day cricket.  But there we go.  Look at that bastard just whacking up.  Now, here's the hand signals. 
[03:17:00]  It's just like watching a home run.  Okay.  Here's...  That means six.  That means six.  Right?  Why does two mean six?  It just does.  Right?  And that there means you're out.  That there means you're out.  Just a one.  Hold a one up.  Right.  And you're out.  If you get four, you get four.  It's this one.  You're making like a little wavy motion with your hand.  Across your body.  Across your body.  We're right in.  Let me say hi to Alex.  He wants in on this.  Alex.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, Jim.  Please explain, because I remember some guy trying to explain this fiasco to me in college, 
[03:17:30]  how you bowl the ball.  Is it true that they have to run up and then throw the ball with their arm perfectly straight  and have to bounce like two or three times?  No.  It doesn't have to bounce at all.  That's a fallacy, because you can do one that's...  Most people do bounce, because then there's a variance on the ball that makes it harder  for the batter to hit, because it could bounce in any direction.  Your arm has to be straight, like an above your head in a fluid motion.  But you can actually...  It is legal to do an underarm, but no one would ever do that.  So if your arm's bent like that, you're called a chucker, and that's like just calling a guy 
[03:18:00]  gay in a bar.  Someone's called a chucker.  Yeah, it'd be a chucker.  Yeah, but you've got to run, and then over the top, bang, like that.  And it's a natural motion.  So like bowlers in cricket aren't like pitches in baseball where their arms go to shit or  whatever.  All right, so now the guy just hit the fucking thing.  Now he's got to run back and forth.  Well, he doesn't have to run back and forth.  He can just stand there if he wants to.  Ah, look at that one.  That was a good one.  Wow, that was a good one. 
[03:18:30]  What if only one comes off?  Are you humoring a man?  How do you know that's...  Can that happen?  You're starting to understand this a little bit?  That can't happen, right?  One.  Oh, he hit it back onto his stomach.  Fucking idiot.  Oh, now they're showing some of the fielding where the guys are jumping, grabbing the  ball, throwing it back.  Now, this is impressive.  If you do classic catches, that ball is like concrete.  That's a lot harder, and they've got no gloves.  Why don't they have gloves?  Because we're men.  What if you catch it?  If you catch it, you're out as well.  They just showed that guy fucking catching it. 
[03:19:00]  Look at that shit.  I don't know.  All right, so this guy's catching it.  Oh, he fucked it up.  He bobbled it, but he'll get it.  Watch.  There we go.  He's all right.  Wicket keeping.  Now, the wicket keeper's got gloves, the guy at the back, but he's like the catcher  in baseball.  Now, you see how he's standing close?  That's for a spin baller, so he can knock the balls off.  But if there's a pace baller, he'll stand way back like that, because the ball's traveling  so fast.  Can he throw it at the sticks from behind?  Yeah, he can't really, but he normally just palms it off to someone, and he's got both  hands free to chuck it out.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Un-fucking-believably confusing. 
[03:19:30]  Shoddy Carpenter's reminding us that we have the Ball of the Century video clip.  Yeah?  Yeah, we do.  There's Brian Lara.  Hold on.  I'm going to write something for Danny.  What the hell's that?  We have the Ball of the Century.  Brian Lara, he's one of the great cricketers from the West Indies.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Now, he's running back and forth.  Yeah.  They're South Africa.  They're dirty bastards.  South Africans.  Dirty bastards.  They explain cricket in four minutes on YouTube.  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  This is cricket.  This is cricket.  Four-minute overview.  Not the Jim Jefferies.  Ten minutes.  And then just run.  I had no idea what you were talking about.  Now, I kind of understand a little bit of what you're talking about.  And now, if it goes out of the fucking...  And it's a flat bat, so there's a lot more shots you can do.  So, you can chip it over.  You can whack it hard.  You can just flick it up.  And you can put the fielders wherever you want.  So, there's a lot more tactical sport because, like, with certain batters, they'll move them all in.  Or with other guys, they'll move them out to the bat.  Now, if it goes out into the crowd...  Six runs. 
[03:20:30]  That's six runs.  That's pretty good, though.  The guy doesn't have to run back and forth six times.  Nah, he just fucking lives in the glory.  So, he puts up two fingers.  No, no.  The umpire will go...  The umpire puts up two fingers for six.  Now, have you ever watched Aussie rules football?  Aussie rules football.  Now, I can talk.  Now, put something on.  Aussie rules football.  That shit is fucked up.  I don't even understand it.  It's a Melbourne thing.  I'm from Sydney.  It kind of has a little rugby and...  A little bit of rugby, a little bit of this.  Put Aussie rules best marks. 
[03:21:00]  You ever seen Aussie rules football, Ant?  Yes.  Holy shit.  And that's where they score like this.  They score like that.  So, you get six points if it goes to the middle.  And if it goes...  If it misses, but just by a little bit, you get one point, right?  Because Australia have that mentality of, oh, you had a go.  Yeah.  You had a...  Give him a point, you fucking arsehole.  You had a go.  He had a...  Holy shit.  AFL at its best.  Here we go.  Look at this.  You can't just give a point.  Yeah.  Because he...  Here we go. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, shit.  They hit hard.  No fucking pads.  They're insane.  But they're all tall.  It's a catching and kicking game.  Yeah, they just catch and kick constantly.  That's all it is.  Oy!  Look at these fucking crazy bastards.  Oh, shit.  They're fucking animals.  No shoulder pads.  No helmets.  Not even sleeves.  They're just...  Yeah, they're wearing shorts.  And you know if they want to pass the ball, they can't throw it.  No.  You've got to have it in the hand, and you've got to punch it out with the other hand.  Are you shitting me?  No, you've got to say the pass ball, you've got to go like that. 
[03:22:00]  That's silly.  Well, the idea is that if you have one arm free, you can't hand it off.  You've just got to let go of it.  Oh.  So they try to disable you.  So that's six.  Through the...  Ah, there we go.  Look at that.  What a wonderful sport.  What do you mean, there we go?  There he goes.  Ah, look at that.  What a wonderful sport.  It's like fucking...  We're looking going, I have no idea what this is.  This is like being an alien.  Yeah, yeah.  But women, see, these big things, they jump on each other.  Holy shit.  They jump up on each other to get up high enough to catch the fucking ball.  You're allowed to put your knee into the other person's back and spring off the other person's body. 
[03:22:30]  And they push up.  Yeah.  As you're jumping.  So you get like 20 feet in the air.  Yeah, well, they're getting about, you know, sort of 10, 12 feet in the air.  Oh, and then I remember seeing the ref do this.  He goes...  He like points his two fingers out.  Yeah, that means six.  That means one.  It depends on which side.  Six and one again?  Yeah, that's six or one.  But it's one finger.  All right.  Alex Weinstein here.  Alex from Omaha.  What's up, Alex?  Yes, I'd like to call Jim Jeffries a cheat because they fucking do do underarm bowling. 
[03:23:00]  Ah, here we go.  All right.  Let me explain.  Let me explain.  Let me explain.  Oh, shit.  Let me explain.  Oh, my God.  Okay, this man we were talking to...  Yeah.  Stop it, young New Zealand man.  Now, this man that we're talking to is from a country called New Zealand, a small known  country, which is basically Australia's retarded little brother.  A lot of sheep fuckers there, too.  A lot more sheep than there are people.  Now, the thing is, the thing is, what happened is many, many, many years ago, was it the 70s 
[03:23:30]  or the 80s?  It was in the 80s.  In the 80s.  It was in the late 80s.  Late 80s.  The Chapel Brothers, who are these famous cricketing people from Australia.  Australia looked like they might have lost this game, right?  And they had one ball left.  And if the guy hit, the New Zealand player hit four runs, we would have lost the sport,  right?  So, very unsportingly, the Australian guy bowled it underarm along the ground so it couldn't  be hit.  Ah.  And then just went...  It was just being cuntish.  Right. 
[03:24:00]  It was just being cuntish.  But it happened in the late 80s.  And the New Zealanders, if you meet them, they're still fucking upset about it.  86 World Series, Mets and Red Sox.  That's right.  Bill Buckner.  That's the same fucking thing.  The Red Sox fans understand.  Yep.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Damn.  Fucking Rick from the Bronx is hysterical.  What, what, what?  He said, like, what he said about us.  Yeah, let's go there first.  Rick in the Bronx. 
[03:24:30]  What's up, man?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Okay.  This is like trying to teach chess to a bunch of monkeys.  It's exactly what I saw that.  I'm like, chess to monkeys.  I wouldn't try to teach Americans chess.  I don't think you'd ever figure it out, would you?  All right, guys.  We love chess here in this country.  No, you're checkers people.  Nah, checkers.  All Jewish people in the park like chess.  What's a smelly?  What's a smelly?  That's the same everywhere.  Okay, because I think Dogshit Sniffer's trying to do a John Sterling. 
[03:25:00]  The smellies win.  I don't know if that means anything.  I just, I'm looking for it.  All right.  Let's go to Kellen in England.  Kellen.  Hey.  Hey, Kellen.  Hey, I'm sticking up for Jim here.  Fucking baseball.  It's not that hard to understand baseball.  And then we try and explain cricket to the Yanks and they just fucking lose their mind.  It's really not that hard.  I'm starting to realize that it isn't that hard.  I started getting the hang of it.  As soon as you realize that, you gotta, like, stop thinking about baseball.  Look, also, fucker. 
[03:25:30]  It's not quite that we're retarded, but the explanation, I mean, I love Jim Jeffries, but his explanation sucked the dick.  I've never been a good shooter.  Larry King's checking in, Anthony.  Larry King?  Yes, the Larry King.  Larry!  Hey, Jim, I want to ask you a question.  Actually, how important is the wicket and cricket?  And is there any coincidence that wicket and cricket rhyme? 
[03:26:00]  Larry King question.  Very important.  And yes, there is.  What the fuck is a wicket?  I just explained it to you.  That's that strip that the guy bowls the fucking ball on.  But each time you get out, it's called your wicket as well.  They had nine wickets today.  They had six wickets today.  If you get a wicket, that means...  And it's also, wicket was the youngest member of the Ewoks from the third Star Wars film.  Really?  You know, one of the dwarfs in the little bear outfits.  I enjoy a good game. 
[03:26:30]  That's what I always think about.  Do you reckon George Lucas, like, how many dwarfs do you reckon he knows?  Like, all up, George Lucas.  Fuck.  All of them.  He's got to know all of them, right?  He's got to know a lot of dwarfs.  George Lucas has got to know...  There's a dwarf that does stand-up comedy in LA.  Really good guy.  But he's always surrounded by porn stars.  Really?  Like, all my favorite porn stars.  Because he's done a couple of walk-ons.  He never fucks in them, but they always need a dwarf just to do it.  Like, play a butler or something.  Make it goofy.  Yeah, make it goofy.  And so he's just fucking surrounded by porn stars. 
[03:27:00]  I'm like, fuck you mean...  Out of all the disabilities, I think dwarf's the one that I'd want.  Really?  Because if you've ever met, like, a real good dwarf, like a real small midget or a dwarf or  something, they'll just go up to a girl and pinch him on the arse or go up and sit on  their lap inside a nightclub and just go, ah, what are you going to do?  Ah, I'm a dwarf.  I'm a dwarf, right?  But people with cerebral palsy, it's just creepy, you know, when they're using their  pinching stick.  Or a quadriplegic just sticking out their tongue at people on the side of the road to buy pens 
[03:27:30]  off them.  Like a dwarf, at least.  It's like, hey, what are you going to do?  I can dance for you.  I saw a show on, what the fuck was it the other night, like Weird Couples, and this  one guy, normal kind of fucking...  Oh, no, TLC.  Normal guy is with this woman who is a little over two feet tall, and she had a completely  normal head. 
[03:28:00]  Her head looked like kind of a good-looking blonde woman.  She was a bubble head.  A good-looking, like, blonde chick.  Oh, no, she ain't good-looking.  I know what you're talking about.  No, no, no, she...  Are they dwarves married?  No, no, no.  He's totally normal.  Oh, okay.  He's totally normal.  Sorry.  She is like...  Very good-looking.  She's this blonde...  No, that's not her either.  No.  She's like this blonde chick, and, like, her head is normal and kind of looked all right. 
[03:28:30]  But her body was so fucked up, and it was one of those, like, she was squished in something.  I'm not...  I can't be sure.  She's not that hot.  No, no.  I don't think it was her either.  You'd just be getting a lot of blowjobs, didn't you?  Engaged to a six-foot-four-inch man.  Might be.  I don't know.  That's a little weird, though.  There was a girl at the comedy club the other day that had, like...  Oh, God.  Who was normal-looking, but had, like, flamidamite hands just out of her shoulders.  Oh, little flipper hands.  But she was fucking hot, man.  And this is... 
[03:29:00]  I just wanted to ask her, because her hair was so nice.  How did she do her hair so nice?  You want to ask that?  You know, when did that...  Like, that's the guy.  But it's so fucking funny.  He carries her around everywhere.  Yeah.  Like, he carries her like a baby.  Well, wouldn't you?  You don't want to wait around all day.  No, I know.  Just to go to Starbucks.  I don't even think she could, like, stand.  She's, like...  She's really fucking small.  And then they had a baby.  Well, just cover the rest of her up.  And you wouldn't know the difference.  But that's what I think would happen. 
[03:29:30]  Like, he probably got hammered.  Just have a lot of tall tables in your house.  He probably got hammered, and she put some pillows under the blankets, and pulled the blanket up to her neck, and gave him a really good blowjob.  Oh, what you do is, what you do is, you get her in bed, and then you strap the body of a blop doll onto her neck.  Like, like, like, you're fucking a full-size human.  Yeah, a human.  And then, like, the bonus is, the bonus is you get to punch her in the ribs.  Like, what you really want to do with a lady, but it's just a blop doll, and she can fake the screams and everything, when you're really just punching her in the foot. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, shit.  Like a real-life human.  You know, that, that would be something.  That's a good one.  I just saw that, and, like, he's carrying her around.  Yeah, and, like, like, when Yoda's carried around by Luke Skywalker, when he's going through that test.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, through the test.  That's how he's carrying her around.  In a little backpack.  Do you judge me by my size? 
[03:30:30]  Steven S. from Bayshore, George Lucas is the king of the kickables.  Yeah, he seems to.  We call him kickables on this show, thanks to Steven S. from Bayshore.  We call him kickables.  Oh, here we go, here we go.  There she goes.  Yeah, we're watching her.  Oh, she's got a bit.  She must be pregnant.  I think she's pregnant, and she's going down the stairs on her ass.  You know what her ass must look like?  Yeah, but she's not allowed to go on a regular rollercoaster.  And there he goes.  He's got to carry her up the stairs.  Oh, my God.  She could get up the stairs.  Oh, no, the legs don't work, do they?  I don't know.  They're not too good.  You've got to teach that girl a good handstand. 
[03:31:00]  A little walk around on her fucking hands.  That's got to be a nightmare.  Or like a dog.  Like, you know when a dog's got worms, and it drags itself on its ass?  Yeah, through the middle of the legs.  Exactly.  That's a way of getting around.  People want to know, Jim Jefferies, why the cricket bat, this lady trucker, looks like  a sawed-off boat oar.  It's pretty self-explanatory, isn't it?  It's a flat bat that you just hit the ball with.  How about you use a baseball bat?  Because then...  Make the game a lot harder. 
[03:31:30]  And a lot faster, by the way.  Then the game would only last like a day.  So what's wrong with that?  One day, that's crazy.  Yeah.  No, but it's...  It's got to be five days.  But with that bat, you can play...  Who has patience for five days?  You can play different shots.  You can defend with it.  You can have a goalie stick.  You're not going to have a fucking round bat for a goalie stick.  You've got to angle it.  How many games in a season?  One.  Oh, not many.  One game in a season.  Can you imagine?  No, they'll play like a five game.  You wait five fucking days, and your team loses.  Now you've got to wait another five days to get your first win.  Australia just lost the ashes, which is like the big thing that only comes up every two years. 
[03:32:00]  Like the biggest thing, including...  It's a tournament between Australia and New Zealand.  And we don't really support like your county teams and your...  I don't go for the Sydney Tigers or something.  You know what I mean?  You just follow the national team.  And the national team will play maybe 15 tests a year.  I got...  I got...  Maybe it might be like 10 tests a year.  I'm not sure.  I got audio of a cricket game.  For real.  Listen.  Literally, yeah. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, don't be like that.  What do you want to be like?  Oh!  Mildly...  So this is the weird thing about...  Okay, in Britain, the most offensive word you can say is the word paki.  That's as bad as the N word, right?  I think we've talked about this before.  Yeah, we have.  Yeah, and that's the thing is we play...  In Australia, it's not derogatory.  It's short for Pakistani.  And we play...  We play Pakistan in the cricket.  And the English are always amazed because there's big billboards all around Sydney that'll be like,  the packies are coming. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, shit.  Right?  For us, it's just like the word Aussie.  And the English people just...  They're all underneath having photos taken.  You know, a bit of ironic racism.  They love it.  Yeah, they love it.  It's the whole thing about like...  With racism or something like that, if you see a billboard like that, you'll still have  a photo taken in front of it.  No one will ever be upset.  I've got this theory at the moment on...  I had a mate who said to me the other day that women have become sluttier than they used  to be.  No, it's not.  It's just that we don't have to develop film anymore. 
[03:33:30]  You know what I mean?  You make a good point there.  It's like...  It's like...  Like, this whole idea of doing...  Like, I've got girls sending me pictures of them naked on their phones.  Yeah.  Right?  That never used to happen.  No.  They're sluttier.  The technology's just let them become the sluts they want to be.  You know what it would have taken to actually get...  Because it's usually a spur-of-the-moment thing.  You text in.  And you call you, hey, how about you send me a little picture to see what you look like?  And then you get the picture.  You know what it would have been like? 
[03:34:00]  You know, hey, could you take a picture?  Even if you go to a one-hour photo.  Go down to get it developed.  It's still a long time, right.  And then put it in the mail.  Do you remember back in the day when you did take a few pictures of your girlfriend or whatever?  And you just went down and you tried to find the cool guy at the development place.  And the photo map.  Yeah.  And you were like...  The guy that's not going to call the authorities.  You were like, mate, can you just...  But there was never...  But even then, it might have just been a picture of your girlfriend topless.  Like, that's as racy as it gets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, if I ever become famous famous, there is so many sex tapes of me... 
[03:34:30]  Out there that people have just horrible things that I'm doing.  Is that Jim Jefferies?  You're fucking that dog in the asshole.  I wonder if I'm going to put it out there to any of my girlfriends.  Because they always take them at the end of the relationship.  That's the one thing they can take.  And I'm not smart enough to make duplicates or know how to.  And if there's any of my ex-girlfriends who are listening, just put one out there.  I want to see how it does.  Yeah, you want to see how good it is?  That's really a level of seeing if your popularity is growing.  You know what I mean? 
[03:35:00]  That is true.  If your sex tape really makes the rounds and people are watching it, you know you're a real...  And I've got some good ones.  Like that Paris Hilton one where she just...  I've got ones of me fucking a girl up the ass while she's dildoing herself.  Like a good one.  Terry Farrell who broke my heart, you fucking bitch.  Fucking Jefferies.  Hey, Caroline's...  Am I not allowed to say that?  Is that live?  Oh, that's perfect.  I don't figure it out.  I don't know what the fuck you just said.  Get in the mix.  I got it.  Okay. 
[03:35:30]  Jim Jefferies, he's going to be a hoot at Caroline's all weekend long starting tonight.  212-757-4100.  I've got to go to one of these shows there, Jim.  Got to figure one out.  New material?  Well, maybe not.  Yes.  The thing is, if you've watched the special, I'm not repeating any jokes that I did on the special.  Well, that's good enough right there.  There's a lot of people that have seen that.  You've watched me a few times, so you know other stuff that I do.  But I've written some good stuff since then.  I've gone, I'm working.  I just look at it this way because people...  Everyone who's come to see me has obviously watched the HBO special. 
[03:36:00]  If you've come to see me, you've all heard me here.  And I just think it's a little bit cheap if I go up there and just repeat the jokes that they've already heard.  Yeah, yeah.  People are like, eh.  Yeah.  It's not like going to see a rock band where you go along and you're watching Rolling Stones going,  are they playing Satisfaction again?  They better play them.  I just want to hear the new album, you cunts.  That never happens.  I want to hear the hits.  But with a comic, it's like, I heard this already.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Did that happen to you last week, did it? 
[03:36:30]  It's just happened.  True story, let me tell you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You broke up with that girl again, have you?  That's great.  That's a...  Yeah.  Because comedy's just lying.  Why don't we do line of the day?  It's just a bunch of bullshit.  Just lies.  Line of the day time.  Line of the day.  And then we get the fuck out of the time.  Well, we've got to get out of here a little early today.  We've got a meeting.  Ugh.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to have a nap.  Have we used that excuse lately? 
[03:37:00]  No.  We haven't used that one.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  And maybe she went a little too far, but it's obvious they sat her down and basically,  you know...  Yeah, totally calmed down.  Pistol whipped her and said, you'll never do that again.  And then they allow Sterling with his dumb home run calls.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  That's true.  They allow him to do stupid home run calls.  She can't say anything now because she lost her fucking mind when Clemens was out.  Who cares?  Speaking of you.  There's no doubt who's going to be in that spot. 
[03:37:30]  Shut up.  Oh, God.  That voice.  How unsexy is that?  Oh, you're hitting my G-spot.  My G-spot.  Yeah.  You laughed where you were supposed to, Jim.  Good, good, good.  I know you're a good one.  I know you're comedy.  Just lies.  I think it's time for the line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Mr. King, it's a pleasure. 
[03:38:00]  I've been watching you for years.  Wow.  And you're calling our show for the third time today.  What do you got for the show?  Mr. Z, how thin do you have to slice them?  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I didn't get that.  How thin do you have to slice what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We never explain the jokes, some of those jokes. 
[03:38:30]  We just give out the punch lines because with the whole joke, we would probably be fired.  Yeah.  I've never won line of the day.  It's always been a big decision.  Coke Logic is calling it the paragraph of the day.  Paragraph.  Yeah, exactly.  I've had runner-up a couple of times, which has been good.  You know, it's like silver.  Oh, by the way, Mayor Menino was on live TV yesterday.  If we could take a picture of that for tomorrow.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, we need that. 
[03:39:00]  Who was on TV?  Mayor Menino.  I can't speak.  No.  He's the mayor of Boffston, as he says.  Boston.  Oh, right.  Boffston.  Yeah, you were probably here one day when we were ragging on him.  No.  No.  Last time I was here, we had that guy who came in that went, there was no crack in that pipe.  Remember that guy?  That black guy?  The Washington man?  Oh, Mayor fucking Barry.  Oh, Marion Barry.  Yeah, he was great.  Marion Barry, yeah.  There was no crack in that pipe.  There was no crack in that pipe. 
[03:39:30]  Let me just tell you, there was, no one knows who was in that, what was in that pipe.  Yeah, no one knows what was in that pipe.  I didn't smoke nothing.  He's a politician.  I was smoking something, but I wasn't smoking nothing.  She wasn't a hooker.  She was just a woman who liked to have sex, and she enjoyed money.  That guy's a legend.  I loved him.  He was cool.  I remember about him when he came in, was that he was surrounded by fucking carers, and  I had vomited just before that in the garbage bin, and we somehow roped him in, and one 
[03:40:00]  of the carers looked in the bin and then looked at me, and I was just like, welcome to the  show.  What do you want from me?  Welcome.  But they couldn't get him out of the building quick enough, if I remember rightly.  Yeah, yeah, they dragged him right the fuck out of here, man.  All right, let's get out of here.  Jim Jeffries.  Yeah, let's take it on the road.  Let's support Jim Jeffries, please.  I'll be in tomorrow if you still want me.  Yeah, you're coming back in tomorrow.  I'll come back in tomorrow.  Tickets for the show is 212-757-4100, all right? 
[03:40:30]  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
