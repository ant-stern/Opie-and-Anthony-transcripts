<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show covered a wide range of topics in this broadcast.  The show began with a discussion about childhood illnesses, contrasting past and present approaches to dealing with outbreaks like mumps, measles, and swine flu.  The hosts shared personal anecdotes about being forced into playdates with sick children.  A caller recounted a school closure due to a potential swine flu outbreak, further fueling the discussion about changing disease management practices. This was followed by a bizarre segment featuring guest Rondi Ocala, introduced with graphic and sexually explicit jokes from the hosts.

The show then abruptly shifted to a discussion of a Baja California earthquake, shown alongside footage of an unrelated oil tanker explosion.  The hosts speculated on the earthquake's severity and depth, referencing a previous interview with Dr. Michio Kaku.  This was followed by a live viewing of a space shuttle launch.

The conversation then turned to gun violence in Chicago and the city's strict gun control laws, sparking a debate on the effectiveness of such legislation.  The hosts discussed their recent comedy tour, recounting a disruptive incident involving the owner's son in Rochester.

The show next discussed the 16th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's death, followed by a critique of the movie *Clash of the Titans*, with callers Randy and Keith offering negative reviews.  Tyler Perry movies also received criticism, along with a discussion of a JetBlue incident involving a fallen engine cover and a fatal accident at Disney World.  A caller, Pat, apologized for a previous disruptive appearance.

Tiger Woods' return to golf was a major topic, including predictions about his comeback and speculation on his new goatee.  Jimmy's stand-up routine about Woods, including a joke about chemotherapy, was mentioned. The hosts also reacted with disbelief to a kindergarten teacher's demand for an apology from Tiger Woods. Jesse James's early departure from sex rehab and the hosts' debate on the legitimacy of sex addiction were also covered.  A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a discussion about private versus public schools, with numerous callers—Randy, Keith, Pat, Steve, Joey, Mongo, Tiffany, Wes, Melissa, and Lydia—sharing diverse experiences and opinions.

A later segment opened with a discussion about the speaker’s experiences as a teenage caddy, encountering entitled wealthy children and their parents. This led to recollections of his father's work environment and the stark contrast between his father’s modest position and his boss's opulent lifestyle. The conversation also included descriptions of the speaker's father’s various jobs and the speaker’s emotional response to his father’s death. A private school teacher called in, sharing a similar experience of delayed grief due to work demands. The discussion moved to the contrasting characteristics of private school students, followed by a caller describing throwing a spoiled kid's golf bag into a lake, and a brief mention of a recently deceased wrestler.  Opie then shared his emotional reaction to a picture of a dilapidated basketball hoop. A significant portion of this segment was devoted to a discussion of the new iPad, with Anthony expressing strong dislike for its lack of features. A developer called in to explain Apple's design choices. The segment concluded with anecdotes about Sam Roberts’ birthday party, a discussion about the iPad's sales, a recap of a previous Sam and Dave show, a segment mocking promotional videos, a news report about Juggalos, and Opie's Easter basket from his mother.

A subsequent segment centered on Sam Roberts' seemingly childish birthday parties, including graphic details of his sex life and his family's obliviousness.  This was followed by a surprise in-studio appearance by Jen Sterger, with the hosts and Sam making numerous sexually suggestive comments. E-Rock also briefly participated.

A female guest then discussed her preferences regarding men's attraction to breasts at different ages.  The conversation turned to her macing a harassing man on the subway.  Iraq and Kenny, recurring characters, were mentioned.  After the guest departed, the hosts discussed a recent show taping and a guest's discomfort. The conversation shifted to sports, including a Roy Jones Jr. boxing match, the Eagles trading Donovan McNabb, Obama's first pitch, a Red Sox-Yankees game, and a John Sterling home run call guessing game.  The remainder focused on graphic descriptions and reactions to sports injuries, including those suffered by Joe Theismann and others, with descriptions containing graphic and offensive language.  The death of wrestler Chris Canyon was also discussed, along with a morbidly obese man who avoided jail time, and a Wikipedia page about a previous guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  VIRUS  VIRUS  Aries 197  XM202  Hey, it's E-Rock  And Sam  And the O.B. and Anthony show starts in just a few minutes  Sam, nothing takes you back  Like childhood memories of diseases  What are you talking about?  Mumps?  The flu?  You don't remember these things?  No, I had the flu when I was  Adults get the flu too  These aren't positive childhood memories?  No  Huh  They're sicknesses  Then I read this all wrong  We were reflecting about, you know, when you were a kid  Some of the big epidemics that were out there 
[00:00:30]  Like the flu  Like the mumps  And the way that parents handle these things  O.B.'s parents are a little stranger than others  Unorthodox  Yeah, but you know what?  To each their own  And here it is  It's swine flu, mumps, and the like  On the O.N.A. show  Lucky Long Islanders is a school that decided closed for a week  A week?  Because of the swine flu  A week  Yeah, what, what?  Why?  Why?  A week  There's no reason  And what do they do in that week time? 
[00:01:00]  They go in and scrub-a-dub-dub down the school with antiseptic  I'd rather have my kids home and well  Than somewhere where they may be exposed to sickness  For this mother of students in Deer Park schools  The bold move to shut down the entire district for the week  Is the right move  The extreme measure coming after three students at John F. Kennedy Intermediate  Were identified as having probable cases of swine flu  You can imagine the level of concern that has been expressed by our families 
[00:01:30]  We felt it prudent at this time to have a week in which we could kind of clear the air  And still the waters  Let me tell you something  Another Anthony history lesson  Yes  From the Anthony time capsule  Oh, do we have a stinger for that?  Of Anthony being a kid in school  When I was in elementary school  I remember kids having  The mumps  And the German measles 
[00:02:00]  Wow, dude  You are old  And things like that  And you know something?  It would get spread around  Rubella  The rubella umbrella  They used to say  You must get the rubella umbrella  It's inoculate yourself against rubella  And it was like  But they never shut the schools down  And disinfected  And these are diseases that like  Can kill you  The mumps  You just brought up a great point  Do you remember growing up  Your parents forced you 
[00:02:30]  This is going to hit a nerve  With a million people out there  Your parents forced you to go have  They call them now playdates  Like you would get a phone call  Your parents would get a phone call  And they'd go  Anthony, you're going to go over  To Stu's house  And you're like  But I  I don't know Stu  I know he's in my class  But I don't hang out with him  Yeah, but he's got the measles  Yeah, he's got the measles  Our parents would force us  To play with kids  That had the measles  Sick children  Because they wanted us 
[00:03:00]  To get the measles  Do you remember this?  Yeah, because that was the way  You got  So you wouldn't get it later in life  Right  The mumps was another thing  You wanted to get the mumps  Early because if you got them  After puberty  It could cause  It was a good chance  It would cause sterility  Nice  So you had to get the mumps  Early too  Yeah  Because you know  Fuck a doctor coming up  With an inoculation  It's like  Just shove the kids  Into a hot  A freaking hot zone  Do you remember though?  Your parents would send you off 
[00:03:30]  To hang out with kids  In hot zones  Oh my god  To get that disease  So then you suffer  For two weeks  Yeah  And the parents are okay  Like okay  We could check off  Measle  Whatever  Measles  Whatever  Mommy  Why are my Cheerios  In a Petri dish  This morning?  Just eat it  And shut up  That's insane  Do parents do that nowadays?  Force their kids  To play with the  Hell no  With the sick kids  So their kid  Gets that disease  They put little masks  On them and stuff  And it's 
[00:04:00]  It's a whole other world  I remember like yesterday  My mom shoving me off  To some kids  Yeah  To go  Not to play  To go get the measles  Go get infected  Go play  By the way  It was the chicken pox  I'm a little tired  Chicken pox  Was the big one  That was the main one  Where your parents go  Alright go play with whoever  They got the chicken pox  And we need you to get it  Yeah go ahead  Go rub fucking  Pick his scabs  Go pick his scabs  And eat them  The O.B. and Anthony Show  Starts now  Previously on O&A 
[00:04:30]  And then we  We went into the production room  And we found  Pearl Jam songs  Like regular studio songs  And we played them  And added crowd noise  Yeah  And trying to make it sound  Like it was a live song  It's like yeah  We're here  Yeah the club was called  Larkies  Because  Larkies right  It was Larkies  At this point  Pearl Jam didn't  Didn't have any live music  Out yet  So we decided  To find somebody  We just took like  Studio recordings  Kind of echo  Put some echo on it 
[00:05:00]  Or just a little room on it  You know  And added crowd noise  You know the most amazing  Part of the story  Is that you two  Went into the production room  Yes  Everything takes time  Why would it take  Six months for Jackson  To die  To the day I said he died  You know  Because I do my research  Dude  That's why  I'm on top  Who are you  50 million hits a day  Just googling me  Dickhead  You said he would die  Within a year  Not six months  No I said  Dude

[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yay! 
[00:10:30]  Yay!  Pudding!  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  It's entertaining as fuck.  How many people are screaming at their radios right now?  It doesn't get better than this.  It's just the stupidest, most fun.  I can't get enough of this.  I can't get enough of this.  I would eat your poo.  You know, let's be honest with each other.  No one's doing better radio than this.  We rule Google it.  You're fucking right.  Simple as that.  Fucking believe it.  This is radio.  Radio.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:11:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, the familiar music of the Opie and Anthony program.  Good morning.  Ah, good morning.  And how is everyone this fine morning?  We're good.  I didn't feel like doing it.  No. 
[00:11:30]  Monday.  We're good.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And how's everyone this fine?  Up yours.  Good, man.  Yeah.  Jimmy and I were away, so a little tired from our Rochester trip.  Rochester.  Jimmy killed up there.  My God, man.  It's a great club.  It's a box.  Just a square.  Yeah.  Somebody at the comedy club was trying to be fancy.  This was just a box.  There's a lot of illegal activity going on in that place. 
[00:12:00]  It's very obvious to everyone involved.  Just fucking around.  Heroin mewling.  Yeah.  Crystal meth lab in the back.  Well, the Rochester, just really quick, Ed, the Rochester trip was awesome, and we got  some hardcore fans up there.  I just want to say hi to.  Yeah.  Who knew?  That's great.  Who knew?  You hit the road with Jimmy, and you realize, fuck, people are actually listening to this  damn show.  Well, they love Jimmy.  Well, that's all from the show.  No, they do love me. 
[00:12:30]  They were asking about you, and it was just a zoo up there.  Sweet people.  Because every time Jimmy hits the road, I always ask Kenny on the way in on Monday, I'm like,  well, how's the feel out there?  You get a feel for the show and stuff, and people are digging the show.  It's nice.  It's nice to see.  Certainly is.  Nice to know that you're doing something and making a difference here.  What a difference are we making?  Did you guys watch the earthquake footage on TV last night? 
[00:13:00]  It was pretty intense.  I watched a little bit of earthquake footage, sure.  It's always fun when the Earth decides to shake the fleas off of it.  I love CNN.  They jumped the gun because they got this.  I'm one of these, actually.  An eye reporter.  Oh, no.  You can just be an eye reporter.  So if you see news happening in your area, you send them a video, and every once in a while  they put your video on CNN.  But they always jump the gun when there's something huge happening, and they're like, we're getting 
[00:13:30]  our first eye reports from you guys, and it was actually a bunch of dummies in a restaurant  going, well, that was just unbelievable, and blah, blah, blah.  They're just babbling with no footage of the actual earthquake.  No footage of the earthquake.  Just some babbling idiots with their eye report.  But then they finally got to the video of chandeliers moving.  Yeah, that's always good.  Good for an earthquake, sure.  And pool water moving, and that's it.  That's it.  Pool water.  If this, what do they say in a 7.2?  Wow.  Is that what it was? 
[00:14:00]  7.2 earthquake?  If it hits anywhere else.  7.2 in Baja, California, yeah.  If that thing hits anywhere else, it destroys cities, but, you know.  Nothing there.  Oh, Baja's kind of in the middle of nowhere, right?  It's the California-Mexico border, and...  It picked a good area to hit?  Yeah, two people died.  One guy on the Mexican side is house caved in on him.  Yeah.  And another guy was so scared, he ran out of his house and was hit by a car and killed. 
[00:14:30]  I know.  It's just, you gotta thin this herd.  Oh, my God.  And that's, that is just stupid.  You could picture just some guy just screaming bloody murder running out of his house and  then gets hit by a car.  What's that?  This is an eye report I found this morning.  It's an oil tanker exploding.  That thing did explode, didn't it?  From the earthquake?  No, no, no.  It's not from the earthquake, but it's cool when you see stuff like this in movies, but  I think it's a thousand times cooler when it's really real.  Isn't it?  You can see the shockwave and everything.  It's unbelievable footage of an oil tanker just completely exploding. 
[00:15:00]  Giant mushroom cloud.  Look at that.  Wow.  Holy fucking oil truck.  What's all that shit jumping up in the air?  Is that the truck?  That's the truck.  No.  That's the truck, dude.  How sick is that?  I understand that it was the truck, but a few of those look like they could be people.  I don't know.  Those are pretty big.  Probably not.  They probably got out of there in time, right?  It looks like the footage from Iraq you see where they see suicide bomber trucks.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's the pool water and the chandeliers.  Oh, the chandeliers.  That's all they're showing us from the earthquake.  I told you.  But I told Anthony, as much as we want to make fun of the fact that all they had was pool 
[00:15:30]  water pouring out of pools, think about how weird that would be to see.  Like just see your pool turn into a wave pool?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, your pool water is spilling out over the sides and no one's in the pool.  That is odd.  Because what causes that is the whole earth has to shake the water out of there.  The earth that your pool is on has to be moving.  So that is kind of bizarre to see, but wow, look at that.  Oil tanker exploding. 
[00:16:00]  Man.  I saw.  Now you got to tweak that shit.  You got to tweak that shit, Danny.  That's great.  I saw some footage of the earthquake in China, I guess.  There was that earthquake in China.  And they have people just holding on to like a kind of a bar almost in a hotel.  And they are moving back and forth so brutally and so hard.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  And then it just stops.  They're like, oh, okay, let's get out of here.  And that's it.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  So they're only saying two deaths.  That's it.  And one was a dummy that ran into traffic.  Dummy that ran into a car.  What a dunce.  God, you know, if my...  I just hope...  Ah, never mind.  I was going to say something stupid.  I forget.  I saved myself a bad one right there.  Nice.  It was a bad one.  Bailed out?  Yeah, it was a bit of a bail.  Shuttle's launching in, I think, like four minutes, five minutes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What year?  It always gets me a little nervous.  Those things are getting really old. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, it makes fun to watch.  After a few mishaps, you can't...  It's a don't miss.  Yeah.  God.  Frightening.  You know when that shuttle exploded in 86, they were alive?  Oh, I know.  I've seen a 25-minute breakdown of second-by-second analysis of it, and when the explosion happened,  they show where the crew cabin went.  Yeah.  The crew cabin was actually intact when it came off, so they actually had to look at the  shuttle falling apart and just fall. 
[00:17:30]  They pretty much recently gave a good rundown of what they believe happened based on everything  they found and things that I'm sure haven't been made public.  And apparently, the people in control really didn't know that the whole thing had come  apart and were actually attempting to stabilize their craft when it was just a nose cone, just  the nose and crew compartment.  Pretty sick. 
[00:18:00]  Just working controls and just cables are moving.  So what killed them then?  The impact with the water.  No, they were dead before they hit the water, no?  They say the impact with the water got them.  Wow.  Sick as that.  They just, especially, they fell that far.  Just falling.  You're yelling, you're running out of breath.  Ah!  And you're finally just like, ah!  We're still falling?  Yeah.  This sucks.  This is taking a long time.  Wow, that's horrible.  Maybe we'll be okay.  So the space shuttle's going up in what, a few minutes? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Damn, old space shuttle.  When are they retiring those things?  Soon, right?  Real soon, yeah.  And then what, we have to take a couple of years?  Uh, no, no.  Well, with Obama in there, there's no funding for NASA, so fuck NASA.  So it's going to be a while?  They're going to, yeah, I think they're going back to just throwing shit on top of some old  surplus rockets we have and launching that into space.  Or hitching rides with the Russians to get our astronauts up to the space station.  I thought we had a, uh, a new space craft. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, we're kind of working on things, but the whole, the whole plan was...  I thought, no, I thought they had a schedule, though.  It was like, we're going to end these, and then we're going to take a couple years, and  then we got the new craft that they're going to use.  We did.  Oh, but now that's all scrapped?  Yeah, that's just been, uh, been cut.  All the funding.  You following that astronaut on the space station, tweeting?  He's tweeting?  He's the, uh, I think he's...  Took an upside-down shit today.  It was fun.  I think he's Japanese, but he's taking pictures of Earth.  I figure.  He did Niagara Falls.  He did, uh, he did Cape Cod a couple days ago. 
[00:19:30]  He, uh, tweets pictures of the moon.  You know how...  Those are some cool pictures.  I'm a big sunset guy.  He's a big moon guy for some reason.  Yeah, Earthset.  He's tweeting pictures of the moon every night.  Yeah.  And then, but the other day, he tweeted the other ship coming in and docking.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, some docking.  He has a docking picture.  What's his name on Twitter?  It's Astroshi or something like that.  I don't know.  He's a great one to follow if you're into this Twitter thing. 
[00:20:00]  And apparently...  Because he's tweeting a shitload of pictures from space.  We're up to, uh, the most women ever in space right now.  Oh, boy.  Seems to be the most women ever in space.  Oh, boy.  Can you imagine all the...  Are in space.  Imagine all the period juice just floating around.  You think they're synced up with their, their fucking rags?  Use tampons just floating.  Oh, big, big weightless bubbles of clotted blood.  Just...  Like, like, like it's some deep sea fucking organism. 
[00:20:30]  Looks like somebody fucking let loose the cherry jubilee.  Just floating around.  I didn't know there were jellyfish up in space.  The guy's going around.  Just plucking them out of thin air.  Like jelly beans.  Welcome to the people hearing us for the first time on Sirius, the free preview.  Oh, hi.  How are you?  You might as well go somewhere else because it doesn't get better than this.  That's right.  Period joke.  He starts highbrow and then goes into the toilet.  Right. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  For a moment, they must have thought, well, look, they're talking about, you know...  This is our...  Space.  NASA and space.  This is our family...  Cutting of funding.  This is our family-friendly fucking material.  Yeah.  But moving back to the earthquake, because we had Dr. Kaku on recently.  Ah.  And I didn't forget.  This earthquake hits, and I'm like, wait a minute.  I think Dr. Kaku said fucking, you know, L.A.'s due.  Although it wasn't L.A., but close enough for now.  Southern Cal.  But this is what Dr. Kaku had to say about earthquakes.  And I'm calling it.  This is the year of the earthquake. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, damn.  Last year was year of the celebrity death.  I am calling it.  It's pretty easy to call now that we've had 10 earthquakes in the first couple months of the year.  Just watching this shuttle go.  Is this live?  Oh, yeah.  I'm just taking off now.  All right.  Hold your breath.  Hold your breath.  You can't tell from CNBC with all the fucking things they have on the screen.  I know.  They got stock tickers.  The market isn't even open yet.  It's enough.  Could you just show the goddamn shuttle thing?  Now they got that...  Squawk box live.  It's fucking... 
[00:22:00]  The thing is running.  Stop trying to look like a computer screen, like I'm getting all my information from you.  Assholes.  I like that shot right there where they show like the holy shit, I hope nothing falls off shot.  Yeah.  And then you got to look at the seals and make sure nothing's happening.  How did they get that shot?  It's almost like there's another aircraft following it.  I don't get it.  They got cameras on the ground now that track this thing and just have an amazing zoom on it.  And you know the only reason these launches are on TV, right?  People are waiting for something to happen.  They're hoping for an explosion.  That's the only reason they show it.  Yeah.  Why else would they show this 20 some odd years later? 
[00:22:30]  I still think it's fucking amazingly cool.  That we could do that?  It's just amazing.  Well, see if they get past the burnout of the solid rocket boosters.  That's always a...  There's a point where they curve because they're kind of going with the curvature of the planet.  And that's what would scare the shit out of me because it's got to look like you're just about to start falling.  Just falling out of the sky.  I mean, that's why I don't go to space.  Is that what it is, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Is that why you're not in space? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  At least stupid Channel 5 here locally just talking about some shit.  Health.  Yeah.  It's a miracle happening.  People are going into space.  Yeah, that's pretty amazing.  No one gives a shit anymore.  No one even cares.  That is embarrassing.  We care?  Even the Apollo, though.  Nah, people didn't really care.  Well, we have to go to a new place.  Oh, there they go.  And we'll care again.  That's it, right?  Oh, man.  That's so sick.  And there they go.  See it again on the top screen.  That's when you just get pushed forward. 
[00:23:30]  And there they go.  Separation is complete.  Solid rocket.  And then you go for throttle up.  I don't want to hear that.  Oh, oh, oh.  They lit?  Yeah, there they go.  That's it?  They're fine.  They're on their way.  All right.  Anyway.  What's that mean when they light?  When the back just gets really bright?  Yeah, they turn up.  They crank up the shuttle's actual engines because the solid rockets pick a hike.  And what if they turn the key and the engines don't turn on? 
[00:24:00]  What happens?  No, they've been on since launch.  Is it a key, though?  Yeah, it's a big key that they turn.  And what happens if the accelerator gets stuck?  Yeah, that's another thing you've got to watch out for.  Shift the shuttle into neutral.  The prowler needs a jump.  Anyway.  Back to the earthquake.  So this is the year of the earthquake. 
[00:24:30]  Let's call it.  Yeah.  Now that we've had a million of them, it's easy to say this is the year of the earthquake.  And Dr. Kaku had some scary shit to say on our show less than a month ago, maybe two weeks ago.  He was talking about how L.A.'s do.  And we almost got the L.A. earthquake.  Almost.  Almost.  Baja's, you know, it was felt in L.A.  Oh, and also speaking about earthquakes, by the way, I just want to mention one thing, and then I've got to take off.  Okay, Dr. Kaku.  Los Angeles will probably be the next site for a big, big earthquake.  A prediction.  How's Venice looking? 
[00:25:00]  Why are you saying that, sir?  Well, I say that because the lower San Andreas Fault is cyclical.  It breaks every 150 years on average.  The last break was 1857.  That's the last big earthquake.  So we're overdue.  It sure was the last big break.  We're overdue.  So we're overdue.  How big would the earthquake be?  Well, we don't know.  Anywhere from 7.0 to 8.0 to maybe even bigger.  But all I'm saying is that the lower San Andreas Fault is cyclical, and it breaks roughly every 150 years. 
[00:25:30]  Of course, this is still black magic.  No one knows for sure.  But in our lifetime, in our lifetime, there's a good chance that Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tokyo, and Istanbul, that one of those great cities will be destroyed.  And he just casually says that and then takes a sip of his coffee and moves on to the next thing he does.  Well, he said between a 7.0 and an 8.0, and it was a 7.2.  South of L.A., but right there in Southern California.  But he did say L.A.'s due, and it's going to happen soon. 
[00:26:00]  And that's pretty good.  That's not bad.  Do you see – I'm looking at this earthquake map, and they show the 7.2 Baja earthquake as a big red square.  And then a few other big red squares around it, but not quite as big.  Then you look at the rest of the map.  Do you see all the earthquakes that happened?  Punch up Drudge Report, the front page.  They had that map on CNN last night.  It's all –  Look at all the earthquakes that just happened.  They're not big ones or anything, but they're just – California is constantly being shaken. 
[00:26:30]  On Drudge Report, that's what we're checking out if you want to play along here.  What are the big, like, red squares?  Those are the holy shit.  Those are holy shit moments?  That big one at the bottom is the 7.2.  All right.  So what's – and then what are the little green ones?  Those are just little shakes?  Those are just little, you know, boom.  You get like a boom.  I felt one earthquake the entire time I lived in California, and we thought my sister had fallen out of bed. 
[00:27:00]  Because it was just a – that's all it was.  That was it?  A thud, and it was over.  Wow.  And that's what, like, those little squares are.  Yeah, and that's just happening all the time.  Constantly.  Now, what I find amazing, the earthquake hits, and then within, I don't know, seconds – but, I mean, it takes the media a little longer, obviously.  They know exactly where it – where the earthquake –  The epicenter.  The epicenter.  Sorry, yeah.  The epicenter.  The epicenter.  But what I learned last night, not only do they know where the epicenter is, they know how deep it was in the ground. 
[00:27:30]  Isn't that amazing?  How the fuck do they know that?  Oh, they've come up with some really cool shit.  So, I was like, well, this was only 33 feet below the ground, or – no, actually, it was deep, right?  This one was deep or something?  Yeah.  But they knew.  I know.  They had all the calculations immediately.  It really is something.  So, hmm.  That's a thermite paint.  They've painted the inside of the San Andreas Fault with thermite paint.  Yeah, huh? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, well, why don't you just deny it?  All right, I'll deny it.  That figures.  Yeah, serve your country.  Shut up.  Fucking idiot.  Jesse Ventura.  It's exhausting dealing with the truthers.  They're just fucking annoying.  Everything's a conspiracy, man.  But they don't even have, like, a sense of humor.  I filmed a dumb video of Jesse walking away, and I was kind of imitating him a little bit,  and then I didn't know what to do, so I just bailed.  I wasn't going to confront Jesse. 
[00:28:30]  And now all the truthers are all over my goddamn YouTube channel doing their truth thing.  I'm like, I was just making a dumb video.  Leave me the fuck alone.  You're just a gatekeeper.  Leave me the fuck alone.  Truthers and gatekeepers.  I'm not interested in you truthers and what you have to say.  And now they're emailing me all sorts of manifestos and this and that.  I'm like, here's irrefutable proof, man.  Explain this photo.  Okay.  It's been explained 8,000 times, but apparently you won't listen.  They go deeper than that with all sorts of freaking... 
[00:29:00]  It's just a bunch of fucking suburban white kids that need attention.  That's what it is.  Stop trying to feel like you fucking meant nothing because mommy and daddy handed everything to you.  Yeah.  Stupid fucks.  Yeah, because I was handed everything.  Now I have to make a difference on my own, man.  I got to show that I'm on my own, man, man.  Where are the black truthers?  None.  Oh, they're too busy robbing stores.  Don't get involved in that nonsense.  Shooting each other all over the country, apparently.  Holy shit.  The weather gets nice and the guns come out.  Well, Easter Sunday is gang initiation day. 
[00:29:30]  Wow.  What?  Easter is gang initiation day, which is why you hit all this crap on 42nd Street.  Is it really?  Yeah.  What?  How do you know this, James?  Because I was a member of three different gangs.  Oh, you were?  Yes.  Wait, wait.  You were in the...  Tranny lovers, sweet boys, and fucking worthless third mic fucking...  Wait, how do you know that Easter Sunday is initiation day?  Every year.  There's problems around this time.  Why do they pick Easter?  Why can't they pick some Monday and horrible day?  Fucking cops should...  The cops were there.  Easter's the one day where everyone's happy.  They're in their bonnets. 
[00:30:00]  They're fucking looking for eggs.  The bonnets.  Were there initiations when you were in the Lords?  Oh, the...  Yes.  The Lords.  The Lords.  I love it.  We had a...  It was so embarrassing.  You're so adorable.  We had a shooting two blocks from where we broadcast.  51st and 7th.  Yeah.  Quite this crap.  What the fuck is that about?  I was listening to it on WINS.  Apparently, people were getting shot with not only BB guns, but real guns as well.  Yeah.  Someone got shot in the ankle. 
[00:30:30]  And a woman got shot in the face.  I think that was the one up on 51st.  I shot Marvin in the face.  What did she do wrong?  Why the fuck did you do that?  Probably nothing.  She was probably just walking minding her own business like everybody else.  That's usually what it is.  Innocent bystanders just getting nailed.  And I want to thank Jimmy for letting everyone know after the fact that Easter Sunday is initiation day.  I would have said it's Saturday if we were here.  I would have stayed indoors yesterday.  I don't think you have to worry on the Upper West Side.  Gang initiation day.  It's like me.  I think I can walk around my neighborhood without a problem. 
[00:31:00]  Those poodles could fucking leave a nasty bite on your ankle.  Is that it?  Are there poodle fighting going on in your neighborhood?  You haven't lived until you've been bit by a poodle.  But you can't judge a book by its cover.  So I guess on 42nd Street when you see gangs in certain colors running around, you're supposed  to feel comfortable walking.  Yeah, yeah.  Since you can't prejudge.  I think this is a prime example of the economy kind of taking a shit and things being cut  back.  And you get this kind of byproduct of without the cops, as many cops out there.  And there's still a lot of cops out there, especially in Times Square and in the areas 
[00:31:30]  where the shootings happen.  But it just starts.  It starts kicking up a little bit.  What happened in Chicago?  15 shootings?  Oh, my God.  They just.  There was so many fucking shootings in Chicago that the cops showed up to one shooting.  And there was a camera crew there filming.  And another shooting broke out like a block away.  Right there.  And the cops are just hunkering down behind their vehicles going, holy shit.  And they're saying, holy shit, where is that coming from? 
[00:32:00]  It looked like Afghanistan footage.  Amazing.  And they run out and apparently some girl got shot in the ass or something.  Freaking amazing.  It really is amazing.  And Chicago, by the way, is a city where guns are outlawed.  So the gun control really working well.  Well, which proves we need stricter laws.  That's it.  Stricter laws against law-abiding citizens.  Well, if there's 15 shootings in one city over a weekend, then you need tougher laws, I'm thinking.  But Chicago, you're not allowed to own a gun at all. 
[00:32:30]  Ever.  You can't get one.  You're not allowed.  That's the strictest gun control city in the country.  Not one of.  It is the strictest gun control city in the country.  And it has the most gun crimes in the country.  Does that tell you maybe something else ought to be looked at as a solution instead of just making it so law-abiding citizens cannot get guns? 
[00:33:00]  Maybe there's another way to look at this, like enforcing, really enforcing the gun laws that are already in place.  How about you do that?  How about you don't let these people out on bail after they have 10 fucking gun charges on them?  And then they just let them out to do whatever the fuck they want to do again.  How about you do that?  How about you revamp the legal system like that instead of just make it so some ordinary schmo who's been good his whole life and wants to own a gun can actually do that in Chicago? 
[00:33:30]  But no, they won't do it.  Doesn't this prove that it doesn't work?  I mean, is there anything besides this that can actually...  This is field testing.  This shows that they have the strictest laws ever.  No one's allowed to have a gun.  Yet they have plenty of shootings.  And they had the worst weekend of all the U.S. cities, right?  Great weekend where people were just shooting up each other. 
[00:34:00]  It was amazing over there, like a fucking arcade.  Unbelievable.  So, there you go.  We're off to a fine start today.  It's going to be a nice day here in New York.  Oh, my goodness.  First of all, the weekend here in New York was great.  We've had nothing but severe rain over the past few days.  And then the weekend pops up and...  What was the temperature down here?  Oh, it was wonderful.  Rochester, we got in the mid-80s.  80s.  That's crazy.  Really?  That's crazy for up there.  You guys got warmer than we did then.  That's what I'm saying. 
[00:34:30]  I think it was warmer in Rochester than New York.  You guys did 70s?  We got like 70s.  Yeah.  It was nice.  That's a car out.  Didn't get a ticket.  Kenny and I took a romantic walk along the Erie Canal.  Oh, did you?  There's nothing nice about the fucking Erie Canal.  You don't like the Erie Canal?  It's fucking...  It's six inches deep.  It's like four docks with cancer.  It's a terrible...  Terrible place.  Well, the locks were locked, probably.  I mean, they let that water in.  I don't know logically how they do it, but I've seen it all the way to the tippy top, too. 
[00:35:00]  So, I don't know.  I don't understand that whole system, but we saw low tide in the canal when we were up there.  Did you see the little tracks on the side that used to pull the fucking barges through?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Some parts of the canal, they have those...  The old tracks where they used to have like a donkey or some shit, and they would pull  the barges with these things.  To squeeze them through the narrow passages.  Is that what the bike paths are now, like right there?  There's bike paths along.  And jagged rocks, and it's supposed to be like really nice, and I'm like, this is a great 
[00:35:30]  place to just slaughter a prostitute.  Just bash her head along the nice jagged rocks.  Soft fucking soil for a shallow grave.  Fucking depressed wildlife.  Yeah, we didn't see it in its glory, that's for sure.  I mean, when they fill those freaking canals up to the tippy top, it's quite a sight.  I didn't realize.  All right.  It's quite a sight.  But I don't understand why it was, quote, low tide.  What does that mean?  That a ship needed the water somewhere else? 
[00:36:00]  I don't know.  How does that work?  That is odd, because it's been raining.  I don't understand.  I don't know how...  Jimmy's right, though.  You could have walked right in the middle of it without being it above your knee.  Yeah.  There was no water.  None.  Looks to be some dams going on there.  So you didn't like your romantic walk along the Erie Canal?  It was nice, but it was just fun to look at the canal and just what an awful, just non-event  it was.  There was just nothing happening.  So you've got to rent a bike and then go down the canal a bit. 
[00:36:30]  I threw rocks at ducks.  They didn't even try to get out of the way.  They were, like, hoping I would strike them.  Please hit and kill me.  I wanted to do...  Because all these families along the canal, like, you know, have an ice cream and cotton  candy.  It was really...  It was like the fucking festive scene from Jaws when they're walking through and he's  laughing and smiling.  Amity means friendship.  And I wanted to know, what would people do if I just started throwing rocks at ducks  and screaming, like, you motherfucker, like, just ruining their whole day?  Oh, you suck.  That would be so nasty to look for people. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my God.  We were just trying to have fun here.  All right.  We're going to learn about the Erie Canal.  What the hell?  We'll be back to fart jokes in a minute.  Educational programming.  Brian in Rochester.  Brian.  Hey, they shut it down in the middle of November to middle of April for maintenance.  So, they'll start filling it up and letting it in any week now.  What kind of maintenance do they do on a bunch of rocks?  Yeah, what's the maintenance all about?  Dredging.  A lot of stuff on the locks. 
[00:37:30]  If you went down Clover Street, you would have seen that they had that lock all ripped  apart.  Oh, so they're...  All right.  They're doing a little maintenance on the locks and stuff.  When I used to live up there, I'll tell you one cool thing.  Canal Days.  They still do Canal Days, Brian.  Canal Days ruled.  The fucking water's up to the tippy top and everyone just gets in boats and just drink  their faces off and fucking there's live music and it's really...  And tubing and stuff, so you're just hanging in the inner tube and just listening to music.  I guess they need something to do. 
[00:38:00]  Jimmy, you ruled this weekend.  You were awesome.  Thank you very much, man.  All right, Brian.  You're coming back.  I don't know.  Probably a year.  Probably a year per market.  That's all you get.  It is funny that people, like, what they'll see there, like, literally, you'll see a guy  right before the show and he'll go, dude, I'm looking forward to seeing you when you're  coming back.  I don't know.  Let's just determine I'm not going to suck this time.  And we'll see.  Probably about a year.  No, it was some solid shows up there.  And yeah, you had two good comedians in front of you that did a very good job. 
[00:38:30]  A guy, Matt, I wish I remember his last name.  He was the host.  He's tattooed.  Yeah.  Tattooed.  White guy with tattoos all the way up to his chin, basically.  Yeah, he looks like a white supremacist, but he's not.  He's just, he's like a fucking metal guy.  And I'm sorry, Matt, that I should have written your name down before the show today.  Yeah, he was a funny dude, man.  And Jamie Lissow from Weezer's show is really funny, man.  He's funny on the radio and he's a funny comic.  I put a taste of his comedy on the YouTube channel.  Yeah, he's great.  I filmed you too, but we got to talk.  I want to see what I can put up there and what I can't because I don't want to mess your  thing up. 
[00:39:00]  Well, you missed Kenny screaming on the late show.  I heard.  I heard.  What was he screaming about?  Oh, well, I wish I would have brought the, I have it on tape too.  Do you?  Yes, I'll bring it in tomorrow.  Could you hear him?  Could you hear him?  Dude, we need that on the air immediately.  I'll bring it in.  I'll get it tomorrow.  Are you kidding me?  I didn't think.  I heard.  There was a, let's just say there was a guy up front who wasn't, he wasn't heckling  loudly.  He was being very, very disruptive to the show in his own way. 
[00:39:30]  And again, I'm doing this a long time.  I know what people are doing.  And the first comic had an issue with him, like the first comic, because the guy was  just trying to eyeball the comedians.  Fuck.  Like dead, trying to stare.  With the crooked mouth, kind of.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but just, he was all tattooed up and just kind of staring at you, trying to make you  uncomfortable.  At least that's what it felt like.  So the first guy, I guess Matt said to him, what are you, and Matt was funny, man.  And Matt said, what's, you know, you're not laughing.  What's the matter?  Which I would have said to Matt, you never ask a person, what's the matter?  Why aren't you laughing?  Because that really is like handing an audience member a hammer. 
[00:40:00]  But the guy went, you're just not funny, or something like that.  Like just kind of douched him.  And so the guy was eyeballing me while I was on stage, and I called him out on it.  And, you know, I smashed him throughout the show.  And then I found out why, who he was.  And I found out by Kenny yelling in the back who he was.  And my, Kenny was right by where my flip cam was.  I haven't heard it, but you have to be able to hear it.  Dude, you can say it?  No, I know I was going to save it.  But it was, the owner's son, I guess, was.  It's the owner's son was disrupting the big fucking comedy show. 
[00:40:30]  Why would he do that?  And this comedy club doesn't get comedians of the quality of Jim Norton.  Of Jim's caliber?  So it's kind of stupid to have the owner of the comedy club's son heckling Jim.  Because now Jim can decide, you know what, fuck this place, I ain't coming back.  But he wasn't heckling like, it was a weird one.  Because it wasn't like, you know, someone yelling.  Because that's easy to deal with.  It was, like, little weird things.  Like, I was like, you know, it's funny.  My girlfriend said, like, I'm like, she wrote this, it's really funny.  He goes, Moe's not.  Like, that type of underhanded, quiet shit. 
[00:41:00]  And so I kept addressing it and going, what are you doing?  That passive aggressive shit, that's woman shit.  What are you doing?  Cock.  But as time went on, I started to think, like, eh, what's he doing?  And I think he was just really fucking drunk.  Like, which made me actually not dislike him.  Because it's like, when somebody's that lit, they're like,  you know, they don't know what they're doing.  Get the fuck out then.  I thought they should have just moved him.  I mean, you.  I should have just left him.  Why wasn't he removed? 
[00:41:30]  Because of the owner's stuff.  Well, Kenny was asking that, why not?  And again, he wasn't yelling loud enough.  But I wanted to get into it with him, just to really bury him.  But then he would be like, no, I'm having a good time.  Like, it was really hard to read.  But I think he was just literally, but he was making people around him uncomfortable.  Because I actually don't mind confrontation.  Sometimes it's really, it's fun.  Because you kind of, as they say, go off-roading a little bit.  And you, you know, you get to really fucking pummel somebody verbally.  But the guys around him would go, yeah, it's just uncomfortable. 
[00:42:00]  They could just feel his toxic, shitty vibe.  And they said it to me after the show.  And one guy said it during the show.  It's like he was sitting there in the front row.  He was sitting in the front seat.  And literally, he had his leg up on the chair with his legs open.  Like, the way I have my leg up on the console right now.  It's like he's wearing shorts kind of with his legs open.  And I'm like, put your leg down.  What are you doing?  Who sits like that?  It was really annoying.  I don't want to look at your bag.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Yeah, it was really a weird.  What an asshole. 
[00:42:30]  Really a weird vibe.  But that was the late show Saturday.  And a lot of people were there.  And they were kind of annoyed about it, too.  But in general, all the shows were good except for that one.  That show was, that was one of the best sets.  And that was a good show?  It was a phenomenal set.  Oh, good.  You're a true professional, Jimmy.  Most guys would have lost their mind.  No, you just guys, I don't mind.  I'll smash somebody for the whole hour.  I kept going back to him and fucking burying him.  Oh, good, yeah.  Yeah, I wish I would have known who he was earlier, though.  Because that would have really killed him.  No kidding.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, by the way, the oil tanker explosion.  Big duties on Twitter.  And I'll retweet it off OP Radio on Twitter.  But we got the video for you that Danny was talking about to start this break.  So, all right.  Yar.  You want to take our first break?  Why not?  We got a lot of sports talk today, man.  Tiger Woods is back.  Baseball started.  I'm just fine.  I'm done with the fucking Yankees, man.  They're what?  0-1?  It was 5-1 when I saw it.  I was in a restaurant.  And I guess that cracked bullpen came through. 
[00:43:30]  There's nothing worse than your bullpen blowing a lead.  Unless it was Sabathia.  Well, the, you know, fucking, the Sox, they weren't looking that good as far as their pitching at the beginning of the game.  And we fell apart at the end.  Well, we'll talk about that.  We.  Shut up, Anthony.  Exactly.  Stop saying that.  What did you do?  The Yankees.  I sat there and watched.  That's all I did.  I did nothing.  Your big bag hanging out in a schlitz.  We.  Schlitz. 
[00:44:00]  Fucking we.  And I make a point of never saying we.  I know, but we all do it.  Why did I do that?  You know, when we were talking about earthquakes and they, uh, what did this guy write?  The guy goes, if you heard a loud thud Friday, it might have been Anthony falling off the wagon.  Might have indulged over the weekend.  A little indulging?  Oh, yeah.  It's tough, isn't it?  It's tough, isn't it? 
[00:44:30]  It's tough.  It's impossible.  No, it's not.  There's no stopping.  You know what?  Sure is.  I will, I will, I will drink in moderation on the weekend.  Aha!  And I will leave it alone during the week.  Absolutely.  That's, let me, let me, I'm not saying you can't do that.  Because I never planned on not drinking ever again in my life.  I know, but you planned on going more than four hours.  No, in a week.  I have diarrhea.  I am going to shit only on the weekends.  It doesn't work that way. 
[00:45:00]  It did announce you weren't drinking for a while.  A little while.  So, Jimmy is correct.  A little while.  And I don't think it was a little while.  Six days?  You know what?  I realize, though, my lifestyle, anything I do and anywhere I go entails having a beer  in my hand.  But you shouldn't have announced it on the radio, I guess.  No, why not?  Because that's exactly what my mindset was at the time.  I pretty much throw it out there.  But it's not part of who you are.  See, we tend to think that.  You know what?  And I'll tell you how I know this. 
[00:45:30]  I, when we went from afternoons to morning radio, I was actually thinking like, boy, you  know something?  I haven't done a radio show without having a few beers in me in, I think, ever.  You know?  So I'm thinking, am I going to be loose enough?  Am I going to be?  And then it works out fine.  You know?  Obviously, I'm not sitting here pounding beers down at six in the morning, seven in  the morning.  I wait till 1030 when I'm off and driving home.  Not very funny. 
[00:46:00]  But, like, the weekend rolls around.  And it's like Friday night.  I go to see my brother.  He was playing at Stout here in the city with the 2U.  And I'm standing there going like, you know what?  I want a fucking Guinness.  I want a Guinness.  I want a goddamn Guinness.  So I had a couple of Guinness.  I got on the train.  He actually took the choo-choo.  And took the train back home. 
[00:46:30]  And then did a Live from the Compound show Saturday.  And from 9 o'clock when I started till 1130 when I stopped, one beer the whole time.  Never got up to even get another beer.  You know, I don't know if you know this, but in my 41 years of life, I've never met  an emotionally healthy person who actually counted their drinks.  Do you know, social drinkers, if you say to a social drinker, how many did you have?  One or two?  I might have had two.  Maybe.  I'm not really sure. 
[00:47:00]  You know who counts them?  We do.  People with a pistol in our head.  I had exactly 14 sips.  14 sips.  No, so I figured I won't drink during the week because that's my workout time.  And then very, very moderate during the weekend.  And that's that.  Because, you know, I don't want to get out of control and be drinking every day of the 
[00:47:30]  week.  Absolutely.  And it's like I was once told, insanity is doing the same thing over and over again  and expecting different results.  That's insanity.  Ratspin ratted you out on Pal Talk.  He needs credit.  Because I said to some guy, I'm sorry that I don't give everyone fucking credit every single  fucking moment of this radio show.  So, Jesus Christ.  It's unbelievable with these people.  They like their credit.  They certainly do.  Well, we give a lot of credit out there.  So, relax. 
[00:48:00]  But he ratted you out.  So, there you go.  I knew when I was talking to you before the show and you said, I took the choo-choo train.  I'm like, well, that didn't last long.  Well, I had to take the choo-choo.  I didn't want to drive.  Because you hate the fucking, you don't like trains and.  You know what?  The club was like a half a block from Penn Station.  And I live very close to, you know, a train station where I could just hop on the train.  So, I was like, you know something?  Fuck it.  I want to go to the city.  I don't want to drive.  So, I hopped on the train.  It was the first time I took the Long Island Railroad in quite some time. 
[00:48:30]  And, Jesus.  Just what a mess.  The train?  Yeah.  It's just, like, people just annoy me.  You know how I am with people.  Well, the train on a weekend is just a bunch of partiers going back and forth.  Yeah, and then, like, some black guy's walking around with a big case of makeup where who knows where he stole it or got it from or whatever.  And he's, like, trying to sell it to these girls that are just sitting there trying not to get fucking raped.  Yo, you want some makeup? 
[00:49:00]  You need some makeup?  You're beautiful, man, but with a little makeup.  It's like, does this guy, why isn't a conductor throwing this motherfucker off the train?  What is he doing?  He's not fucking going up and down the aisle selling his goods.  What is this?  I saw the best scam.  Where the fuck were we?  Oh, we were going to, oh, UFC.  I was taking a train to Newark.  Woman gets on and goes, please.  She was dressed pretty good.  White, by the way, because I'm sure you're about to jump in with someone. 
[00:49:30]  No, no, no.  I never prejudged.  White woman, middle-aged, and she goes, please help me.  I got two kids on the train, and I lost my wallet.  I need $11 to get my kids home.  I will never believe anybody asking for money's story.  I yelled bullshit, and everyone started getting fucking mad at me.  I'm like, bullshit.  Open your eyes, people.  Because I was a commuter for a long fucking time, and on subways and stuff.  I'm like, this is such bullshit.  It's a scam.  People couldn't pull out their walls fast enough. 
[00:50:00]  She walks through the car.  She's like, well, that's $2, like $90 and $11.  Okay, that's $3.  I'm getting there.  $4.  Okay, I'm getting there.  And walks through the train.  I'm like, she doesn't have kids on this fucking train.  She's working the train.  God, you dummies.  Where are the kids?  Oh, yeah, show me the kids.  Where were they?  She left them on another car?  Obviously, they were on a seat, yeah, in the car she came from.  And I yell bullshit, and everyone looks at me like I'm a fucking lunatic.  I'm like, what are you people, stupid? 
[00:50:30]  Wouldn't you ask first, did anyone find a wallet?  Right.  She goes, I lost my wallet.  I need to get home.  I need $11.  And she walks right through the train and into the next train to start the spiel again.  I'm sure in the next car she needs $11, too.  Of course.  But they look at me like I'm an asshole because I stayed the obvious.  Did you say anything like, shut up, she's lying?  I said bullshit really loud.  Like after they started looking at you.  I'd be like just looking at you.  I'm going, stop with your looks.  I said what I had to say.  Dummies, go ahead.  I wasn't going to get too involved, but I did yell bullshit real loud. 
[00:51:00]  And people were like, oh, God, have a heart.  I'm like, really?  You're being scammed.  I don't feel like being scammed.  Yeah.  You know?  I would give her the $11 just because it's obvious she's down on her luck.  But I don't feel like I'm, I don't want to be scammed for it.  People asking, did she comment after, I'm not loying?  I'm not loying.  I'm not loying.  Oh, God.  Have you seen his Twitters?  God, he's ready to just fucking jump off a building.  What's wrong with him?  His tweets.  I'm hoping to be back on the show by next month. 
[00:51:30]  I'm hoping.  We have to take a break from the Bobo.  Of course.  Bobo needed a giant break from the show.  Yeah, that's all.  And he's still on hiatus.  That's all.  We bring everybody back.  I mean, there was a time Stalker Patty was on the show every other day.  We had to take a break.  The big A, we had to take a little break.  That's all.  His tweets are nothing but the sad, I think I'm coming back.  I'll be back.  Well, if he blows a dog, we'll put him back on the show.  Oh, shit.  We want video, too.  He'll have that little lipstick in his mouth in two seconds. 
[00:52:00]  Bobo, if you blow a dog, we'll bring you back on the show.  Oh, okay.  Well, it's for the show.  For the show.  It's for the show.  You have to put that lipstick.  For the show.  You have to put that lipstick dick in your mouth for how long?  A couple minutes?  Until he's got to finish the dog off?  Give the dog a good blow.  How about until you'll know the dog is done because it starts scratching his face to make  him stop?  That's how you know when you're blowing a dog, that's how you know the dog is finished.  When he claws your face.  Is that the human version of, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, 
[00:52:30]  and ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ah, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Done, done, done, done.  A dog doesn't know how to say, I came.  You're hurting me.  After they scratch you.  First one in the morning?  Oh, my.  He's so excited  It seems that Bobo started a hashtag on Twitter  For people to put that in  If they want to see him back on the show  And how many hashtags?  There's none  None  That's adorable  Alright we should take a break  So congratulations Anthony made it six days 
[00:53:00]  That's pretty impressive I'm thinking  What do you think Jimmy?  It is and three of those I was sick  Yeah  From the hangover that caused these six days  No it was an actual stomach thing  Yeah  Swear  Yeah  I think Anthony will be ready soon  Ready?  I hope so  No  For Anthony's sake  No  I love Anthony  I want Anthony to be happy  Oh I'm happy  I am so happy  He's happy with his Guinness  Oh  Hey we gotta get Sam in here too  Because we had a prediction 
[00:53:30]  And man we  That came true  We lost another wrestler  And we told Sam  That this stupid wrestling  Thing  Can't go 100 days  Without losing a wrestler  Yeah  We'll explain after the break  With all the things  Opie and Anthony  Well Travis is playing this 
[00:54:00]  Because Kurt Cobain killed himself  16 years ago today  Damn  That's 16 years  Holy shit  That went fast  16 years ago  Wow  Wow wow wow  The Opie and Anthony show  Clash of the Titans  Number one at the box office  Now I'm hearing this  Clash of the Titans  Is not a good movie 
[00:54:30]  No  Getting kind of bad reviews  But it's in 3D  It's gotta be good  Everything's gonna be in 3D now  Yeah  Half these movies  Weren't made in 3D  They scrambled to make it 3D  After the fact  Yeah  I'm not sure if that was the case  With Clash  But  61 million at the box office  And why did I get married too  What's that?  I think that's another  Tyler Perry  Oh my god  He can pump out a movie  Are you kidding me?  Faster than anyone  I've ever seen  Are you kidding me?  He's got another movie out  Why?  Is that another giant hit? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah it did 30 million  Holy mother of fuck  I don't get these movies  This Tyler Perry  I tried to watch one of them  Just to see what the buzz is about  Impossible  I don't get it  I really don't get it  It's impossible to watch  Yeah  We have a JetBlue flight  That almost comes out  It crashed  They're fucking  Something fell off of it  Something  It looked like half an engine  It's the cover  Just the cover of the engine fell off?  It looked like part of the engine cover  Now  Depending on what made it fall off 
[00:55:30]  Was it some  Newark  Latch  Or was it something  That flew out of the engine?  I don't know  When it landed or took off  Oh  Maybe I should turn your mic on  What do you mean?  When it landed or took off  Heading to Fort Lauderdale  Heading to Fort Lauderdale  So it was taken off  Either that  Or maybe it was just flying over  Huh?  It might have just been flying over  And had some problems  And had to land here  Why is the debris on Newark?  I think  It's true  I think the cover  Whatever you want to call it  Fell off as they were trying to take off  And I'm not  I don't even know if they got in the air  But  Everyone seems fine 
[00:56:00]  But now they're going to have to shut down the airport  For probably eight days  I know  And make sure they figure everything out  If I ran that airport  I'm like  Alright  Get the big piece of junk off the runway  We got flights to land  And take off here  Move it  Why does everything have to be like  Don't touch anything  Do it like Disney  When there's a problem with Disney  Yeah  Hose it down  Let's move on  We got some planes in the air  As a matter of fact  I think a nine year old kid  Got hit by one of those buses  One of those  You know how they got the buses  Going around Disney World 
[00:56:30]  All the resorts  This bus is going to the Magic Kingdom  Please sit down  And get ready to have a great plugging time  And some nine year old kid  Was riding a little bicycle I guess  I guess him and his little friend  Rented some bicycles  And he got hit by a bus and died  Oh wow  By the Wilderness Lodge  And then they just hosed it down  They just hosed it down 
[00:57:00]  The park was closed for maybe five minutes  Not even a park  It's like a resort  They don't care  Oh okay  They probably like  Shut down one lane  But man anything happens at an airport  And you gotta just like  Stop everything for a really long time  I don't understand that  Let's say hi to Randy in Illinois  Randy  Hey boys what's up  What's up Randy  I got it Jimmy  What a piece of horse shit  You saw Clash of the Titans  And it's a piece of shit  Oh is it bad  Yeah  Dude this is the fight team  For like  You had five second camera angles 
[00:57:30]  They're just all fucking jumbled up  You couldn't tell what the fuck  Oh so it's like that real quick cutting  And stuff  So you can't really see  That's  That's  Fighting  That's lazy filmmaking by the way  Cause everybody is using it now  The extreme close up  When they fight and stuff  Cause they're  Right  Cause  And then your mind's going  Wow I guess this is really cool  Cause it's really close  And there's a lot of stuff happening  But you're really not seeing anything  You see it in 2D or 3D  The CGI didn't seem very good either  Sure  Did you see it in 3D  No we didn't see it in 3D 
[00:58:00]  We were gonna  In the fucking times  No  There's no need to write a long explanation  I saw it in 1D  It was just a line  That I couldn't really distinguish  That whole close fighting thing  1B with some O's after it  It's a  It's a Michael Bay thing  I think  I don't know if he started it  But it's definitely  Taken off since  When it first started  It wasn't bad  What was the first major movie  That did it  Was it  I think Batman Returns  A documentary that  Catherine Hepburn shot  On Gladiator  I think you're right  Gladiator  Ridley Scott though  Does that shit pretty good  Yeah no 
[00:58:30]  No  It was pretty good when he did it  Because it was the first time  That you were seeing it  Basically as a movie goer  So you're like  Oh wow this is different and cool  And you were getting enough  Like violence  And then  And now  And they had some kind of shaky shit  But now every director  Is using the extreme  Close up fighting thing  Which is just a bunch of nonsense  And your brain is making  You know  Think that  Something's going on  Unfortunately  I saw the first  Transformers  When it came out  In the theater  And like it was impossible  To tell what was going on  Because like  You know  He's so close 
[00:59:00]  Into the action  And like you know  The Transformers  Like you want to see them  Transform and fight and stuff  And like you're just watching it  Going  I just see shapes  Shapes are moving on the screen  Shapes and colors  And then I guess  Once the battle is over  I'll know who won  You know  Like what am I supposed to do  And I heard there was a lot of that  In the second one  I'm not a fan of that  I'm not a fan of that  Because everyone's using it now  Thank you Randy  I appreciate it  But Clash of the Titans  Not getting good reviews  Man  What is Rotten Tomatoes giving it  But I think it's getting  A lot of people  Going to see it  Because they remember  The old one  And want to see  An updated version  Release the Kraken 
[00:59:30]  Of course  Shit like that  Keith the Cop  Is on the line  What  Keith  Hey good morning  What's going on  Hi sir  Driving to the wonderful  State of Ohio  Why  Yeah  Why  I was on vacation  Coming home  Visiting the in-laws  Oh that's funny  Oh wonderful  Lovely  Lovely  I know  But yeah  We went the other night  We saw it in the IMAX actually  And it was horrible  And you saw IMAX 3D  Yeah 
[01:00:00]  And no  Hope was right  It was one of those  Where it was 2D  And they made it into 3D  So you  You know  There really was no reason for it  Yeah well Avatar  Made everyone panic  So everyone that has  Some kind of action  Film coming out  They're like  Oh my god  Now we gotta turn this  Into 3D immediately  Right right  And I mean  You saw the original one  In 1981  I guess it's not  Supposed to be  Exactly  The same  It's just an adaptation  Of it  But it was  Yeah the way  They told the story  And everything  It was 
[01:00:30]  They were all over the place  It made no sense  So you were frustrated  From the beginning  If you saw the first one  Have you heard anything  About the  I was in the  Time Warner building  Last night  And the Panasonic  Was closed by them  But they had the  3D TV display  Oh I gotta see that  And you can't  Because you have to  Get the glasses  From inside the store  But they were closed  But I'm wondering  If anybody's  I'm not gonna buy  A first generation set  Which is stupid  Nah wait a little longer  Yeah but I'm gonna have  Price will come down  A little bit  They'll tweak it a little bit  There's nothing in 3D  Yet that I wanna see  Really  It's like again 
[01:01:00]  They'll do things  Like Clash of the Titans  They'll take a movie  That was 2D  And just make it 3D  Aren't they doing  The Masters  Thank you  You beat me to  Final 4  Was supposed to be  In 3D  Well you got  Butler versus  What Duke  Yes  In the final  Is that tonight  Yeah that was supposed  To be in 3D  I think the Masters  They're doing it  In like movie theaters  What about the Masters  In 3D  Yeah the Masters  Is gonna be in 3D  Where though  I think on like  Cox Broadcasting  Cox  Yeah  They're doing it  And I think online  If you have like 
[01:01:30]  A 3D computer  Yeah  Where do you get that  I'm serious  You can go  To like the Masters  Website  And watch it there  This is the same  Problem they had  When they invented  The phone  The problem was  No one had phones yet  So I was like  This is good  Who am I gonna call  I got a phone  But this 3D thing  Sounds great  But guess what  No one has 3D yet  Yeah  Well if you remember  HD too  Was a big thing  It was like  Cause I think  I think like  The Tonight Show  With Jay Leno  Was one of the first shows  Network shows  To go to HD 
[01:02:00]  And no one  Had HD televisions  So yeah  You didn't really enjoy it  Can I say  That some of the  Local TV stations  I'm sure everybody  Out there  Has their local  TV station  Which is just  Under the  You know  Just shy of the curve  Can Pixel 11  Here in New York  Get on the ball  Everybody's watching  HD TV  If you're gonna show  Robocop  On your HD network  Can you try making  It look a little better  I mean seriously  Who doesn't have  An HD television  Right now  Seriously  Who doesn't 
[01:02:30]  Why wouldn't you show  Oh yeah  Poor Sam  But they're catering  To people  That have  Regular fucking  CRT TVs  I don't need  Black bars  On the left and right  Side of my screen  I don't  There should not be  I don't like black bars  Anywhere near me  Or my neighborhood  Jesus  I think I have a few  Most of them  On your windows  But it's a  Yeah  To show  A TV  When I see  The following motion  Picture has been 
[01:03:00]  Modified to fit  Your TV screen  It's like  No  You don't have to  Don't fucking  Don't chop this  No modification needed sir  And then they fuck  With you by showing  It widescreen  To roll the credits  So the credits  Aren't all scrunched  And then the movie  Starts  And they scrunch it  It's like  Why did you just  Leave it the fuck alone  It looked good  When the credits  Were rolling  It was fine  Hey I don't want  To lose this caller  Jimmy we got the guy  That was obnoxious  During the late show  Up in Rochester  That you were talking  About before the break  Hey Pat  Hey  What's going on brother  Nothing 
[01:03:30]  I just want to say  Sorry to Jimmy  And Opie  And anybody else  Who's at the show  I got a little  Way beyond drunk  Okay  And my friends  All stuck me in the front  Knowing damn well  That was going to happen  Also they purposely  Put you in the front  Because they thought  It would be hilarious  For you to just  Mess with Jimmy  Well they knew  I had him sit there  Quietly  So they stuck me there  Knowing well  That was going to happen  But you were pretty loaded  Right  It did look like  At one point  I was really annoyed 
[01:04:00]  But then I'm like  He's just really  Really drunk  Yes  I was really drunk  I was drinking  Double tall  Soco and sevens  Does that sound like him  Yeah yeah  Plus his name was Patrick  I think  Alright man  Well thanks for calling  I'm glad  It was just that  And next time  Come and  You know  Be sober  We'll have more fun  Don't worry  I'll be sober next time  It's a good club too man  And I had a good time  There with your father  For the weekend  It's a great club  Alright Patrick  Thanks for calling man  Alright  Take care bro  Steve from Bayshore  That's cool  That's cool that he called in 
[01:04:30]  Yes  Steve from Bayshore  Goes  If you're an asshole  When you're drunk  You're an asshole  It's just  See he's  Now he's one of these guys  That I gotta say  Fucks it up  For people that just like  To go out and drink  And have a good time  But you can hear  Just hear him talk  He was  That's  The guy who just called up  Is not the guy  I was dealing with  Yeah  Like  The guy I was dealing with  Was unreasonable  But not  Again  People's judgment  When they're fucked up  Gets 
[01:05:00]  Gets off  Like you don't realize  You're being distracted  But see now  Isn't that  That's a problem to me  That to me  Is somebody that needs help  Now why  If I wanna fucking  Hang out on a weekend  And drink a few beers  I'm more angry  Sitting here sober  You haven't gotten  To the point  Where you're just  Drinking on weekends  First of all  It's a thought  That you have  Which is nice  And we'll see  How that plays out  For you  I say  If I  You know  Whatever it is  By the way  I don't care  I think it's great  For the radio  I'm just saying  That when I drink 
[01:05:30]  I am a fun guy  I just have fun  Whatever  If you're an asshole  Like that  That you have to  Call up and go  Yeah I was drunk  And I was doing this  And that  That to me  Is the problem  Yeah  That to me  Is a giant problem  Well that's why  They say identify  Don't compare  We should find  The things that we  Have in common  With other people  It's very easy  To find the things  That we don't have  In common  Which enables us  To continue our road  Our road 
[01:06:00]  You know  We're not always  Gonna share  Every trade  Exactly the same way  Is this a new character  No this is just Jim  Is this  18 step Jimmy  No it's a new character  It's called  Don't allow Ann  To talk his way out of it  Jimmy  Why Jimmy  Intelligent people  Have a tougher time  Because intelligent people  Can rationalize  And justify anything  And Anthony's  One of the brightest guys  I've ever met  So you're saying  You have some 
[01:06:30]  No no but it's not  Though it's not  I'm beside the same problem  A smart guy  And I would talk  I can justify anything I do  And you're saying  You have years of experience  As far as this stuff goes Jimmy  Yeah but I also know my own shit  Like I do the same stuff  With other things  Like you know  Like my sex addiction  I'm no better  It's like  I knew what I was doing  I still know what I'm doing  Every time I'm watching porn  I know I'm just dissociating  I'm not horny  But it doesn't matter  No it doesn't matter  I can just be like  Well you know  You're not getting hookers  I can justify anything  Silly  Instead of just going  Cut the shit  Stop jerking off 
[01:07:00]  Until your back hurts  It's not normal  It's not healthy  My dick is like  A fucking mangled turnip root  My girlfriend wants to fuck  And I'm like  Look at this thing  What am I going to do with it  I already used it  Sorry  Yeah sorry about that  It's all fuck  It's got fingerprints  In it like putty  So I'm not judging you  I mean I'm  I just don't drink anymore  But I have the other demons  That was cool  The guy at least called up  Yeah yeah I respect that  And owned up to it so  Absolutely  So the master's in 3D  There's a couple Tiger Woods  Things going on 
[01:07:30]  He's going to  Face the press for the first time  That's blah blah  That's bullshit  Because anything he doesn't want to answer  He's just going to say no comment  Which is fine  That's his right  And I predicted that  He would come back to golf  With a goatee  And be the evil Tiger  Did I not say that  And then it looks like  He's got a goatee  For the masters  You know this might work out  Well for him  I was hoping he would  Grow the hair a little  Fucking crazy too  But that ain't happening  I think this could work out  Well for him  Because he doesn't  Now he doesn't have to  Try so hard 
[01:08:00]  To uphold that  Good boy  Look at me  I'm a role model  Thing  Like he can  Obviously he can't  Just start banging chicks  On the 18th fucking green  He wants to be the role model guy  Again though  But you know what  He can do that  Without having to go so far  The fake role model guy  Over the line  The fake role model guy  Because he was never  That guy  Now he could be like  Look  That was portrayed  I got caught  You saw what I'm all about  Now I'm just going to live my life  And this is who I am  Yeah  So he doesn't have to  Fucking watch every word  That comes out of his mouth 
[01:08:30]  Everything he says  It's freeing  If he turns around  And first of all  The odds are way against him  Because he hasn't played  He really hasn't played  Or practiced as much  As he usually does  In past years  But if he turns around  And wins this Masters  Game over  The sponsors come back  Not all of them  Oh they absolutely  Not all of them  But a couple biggies  Come back immediately  And then  And then within  Another month  No one's going to give a shit  That he banged half of America  Yep  Yeah  By the way  Jimmy's fucking Tiger Woods material 
[01:09:00]  Holy shit  Oh thanks man  I've seen a lot of Tiger Woods material  In the last what  Six months  From comedians  Jimmy's 20 minute set  On Tiger Woods  Is ridiculous  Yeah  The chemo line  Oh thank you  Can we say it  Or is that ruining  Future shows  I mean that's kind of  The punchline  I just say the biggest part  Of his  The punchline  The biggest shot  No no no  I couldn't help myself  To be honest with you  Because the laugh of God  I'm like I gotta remember this  For the radio show  It's  I'm talking about his press conference  I'm like the biggest shock 
[01:09:30]  Was  I haven't seen him without a hat  In 10 years  Was his hair  It's like what do you wash  Your hair with  Chemotherapy  That's a bald joke  Just his hair is not looking good  I know  No  Poor Tiger  Sorry to make him  Perform like that  But when you did that line  In the club  The place was just  Spitting up alcohol everywhere  People were like  Holy shit  Yeah it's still fun  To tease Tiger  But the Tiger stuff man  When  I mean Jimmy's gonna be doing  A lot of shows  In the coming months  Or whatever  You're in for a treat  When you buy your 
[01:10:00]  Jim Norton tickets  Thank you  Speaking of Tiger Woods  His stupid kindergarten  Teacher wants an apology  Everybody wants an apology  From Tiger  Except the Perkins waitress  No the Perkins waitress  Is a star  Oh she certainly is  Listen to this though  When Tiger Woods  Went on the talk show circuit  I was shocked  Saddened  And disappointed  By his false accusations  Of physical and racial abuse  On his first day of school  In my kindergarten class  I first heard Tiger's statements 
[01:10:30]  When he was interviewed  By Barbara Walters  Shortly after that interview  I spoke with some teachers  At Cerritos Elementary School  The principal  And the president  Of the Savannah Elementary School  District Teachers Association  They all felt as I did  Natural speech pattern  That the accusations  Were false  Oh  After phone calls  And personal contacts  By friends and family  Concerning Tiger's false accusations 
[01:11:00]  It started to affect me  In a physical manner  I dealt with migraine headaches  Oh  Elevated blood pressure  And colitis attacks  Explosive diarrhea  It's great  Nervous shitting stomach  Tiger said something bad  About her  She had to run into the bathroom  And shit in the cat box  Good  I cannot fucking stand  That whole deal with  Oh my sleep is interrupted 
[01:11:30]  I can't have sex  I can't do this  I'm a fucking colitis  The kindergarten teacher  Shut the fuck up  The little kindergarten teacher  Is mad  Because he fucking said  He was the victim  Of some kind of racism  In kindergarten  And his teacher  Did nothing about it  So now she's freaking out  Right  Light knob  Well everyone wants  To attach themselves  To the Tiger thing  Yes  The accusations  Against me  Were brought up again  When Tiger's infidelities  Came to light 
[01:12:00]  My friends and relatives  Started reminding me  Of how he slandered me  And the school  I am still feeling  The stress of the allegations  Light knob  I have tried numerous times  To get through to Tiger  Or his representatives  To ask for an explanation  And an apology  But no one has ever  Returned my calls  That is why today  I am asking Tiger  For a private 
[01:12:30]  And public apology  To put my mind at ease  And set the record straight  Fuck off  Shut it  Get your fucking face  Out of the paper  Stupid  Nobody knew  What you looked like  Now you need  To put some out  You need some attention  Yep  With the whole Tiger scam  You need some attention  She's gotta be part of it  Fucking old bag  Shut up  I want an apology  Oh this is great  Joey on Long Island  Joey  What's up fuck boys  What's up brother man  Listen this cunt  Is she 
[01:13:00]  Her voice reflection  Is like she's reading  Cat in a hat  To a kindergarten  Yeah  She talks in kindergarten  Talk  She sure does  She wants a private  Apology  A public apology  And two million  For her fucking trouble  Do  Does she want money  I don't know  It sounds like  What does she want  Apology for  55 years ago  She said she's not  Suing  But you know  That'll change  Oh my god  Acid Rain  Spelled R-E-I-N  I don't know why 
[01:13:30]  Maybe that's his  Twitter name  I don't know  And I purchased  Powder cocaine  For me  And crack cocaine  For Tiger  It does have  That same type  And we were  In Gurney  Where did he go  To school  Gurney  Yeah  Gurney  Come on  Just fucking  Stop it already  And then finally this  If Tiger  Is truly following  A 12 step program  For a so called  Sex edition  He needs to  Apologize  To all those 
[01:14:00]  He has hurt  Shut up  By his words  And actions  And that includes  Me  His kindergarten  Teacher  I always cared  About Tiger  Let it go  As I did  And still do  For all of my  Students  I hope that he  Will care  About the harm  He has done  To me as well  I hope this time  He will contact  Me personally  And be the  Decent  And honest  Person  That his mom  And his teachers

[02:05:30]  Their  QuickTime  Player  Is  So  Much  More  Advanced  You  Mean  The  QuickTime  Player  That  Had  A  QuickTime  Pro  Version  For  7  And  Now  I  Buy  10  With  Snow  Leopard  And  It's  Forcing  You  To  Go  Into  Fucking  iMovie  Or  Whatever  The  Fuck  Assholes  What  Assholes  Well  I  Love  Mac  But  They're  Just  Assholes  With  That  Said  We  Got  A  Developer  On  The  Line  Matt  In  Virginia  Knows  A  Little  Bit  About  The  iPad  And  The  iPhone  What's  Up  Matt  Not  Much  I've

[02:07:00]  And  iPhone  Was  Hacked  Really  Quickly  Where  People  Go  Ahead  And  Put  Viruses  On  Harder  To  Access  Than  Windows  Security  Flaws  I  Think  It's  The  Same  Exact  Problem  They  Want  A  Closed  System  So  They  Can  Keep  A  Logical  Eye  So  If  Something  Goes  Wrong  They  Don't  Have  To  Deal  With  Customer  Support  Issues  That  Windows  Does  He

[02:25:00]  You would be too, Anthony. 
[02:25:30]  You want to come over first?  I'm all right.  I'm good.  He's too busy.  They'll be back.  He's too busy.  Make him believe he's not drinking as much.  Oh.  We have alcohol.  I blew it already.  They would love you.  They wouldn't love me.  My brother, in fact, you met my brother, and he said that he couldn't believe how nice you were. 
[02:26:00]  Can I say this?  My farts last night were so disgusting.  My girlfriend got into bed with Febreze.  She actually brought it into bed with her.  I was so proud of myself.  They were putrid.  I miss the Easter egg hunt, though, because my parents were gone.  You were having an Easter egg hunt?  Yes.  They always hide them under manhole covers and on train tracks behind the gun.  Yes, there's an Easter egg hunt, and just so everything is fair and nobody gets the shaft or anything, there are names written on the eggs. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, so everyone wins.  Everybody gets an equal amount of eggs.  And what if you find somebody else's name?  You don't say anything.  I'm telling you right now, you have to go to Sam's house to see this mother of his.  It sounds crazy.  She's a terrific lady.  Don't get me wrong.  Yeah.  But she doesn't want to acknowledge that all her kids are grown and out of the house.  Yeah, yeah.  They all have to come back for their birthdays and their Easter baskets and for Christmas.  We sleep there on Christmas Eve. 
[02:27:00]  She does not want to acknowledge that they're not like eight, nine, and ten.  My sister, who's now 30, who is 29 at Christmas, she decided to sleep with her husband at their house on Christmas Eve.  Oh, my God.  That did not go over well.  No, I bet.  Because you sleep on Christmas Eve.  You sleep at home.  Yeah.  So you can wake up Christmas morning there.  Yeah.  You spend Christmas Eve.  We open each other's...  Oh, wait.  It didn't go well because you weren't at your mom's house.  Well, she wasn't there, yeah.  I was at my mom's house and so was my brother.  And Jess was there, too, because she knows. 
[02:27:30]  Do they think you and Jess are, like, bestest pals?  No.  They do know that you're...  Are you, like...  They do know you're fucking, right?  Yeah.  I don't...  We don't have those discussions.  They do know that, right?  They know that you go ass-to-mouth, have you guys talked about that?  Your mom does realize that there's some horrific things going on when they go upstairs with their fucking nightcaps on.  Like, it's not like you and your best pal, Jess, is coming over.  Oh, look, look.  Sam's brought his friend over.  Well, you know, you're on the pull-out couch downstairs and they got their nightcaps on and a candle as they walk upstairs to the bedroom. 
[02:28:00]  They do know, as soon as they blow out that candle for the night, that horrific things are happening downstairs.  The old bed just fucking creaking away.  Towards the night before Christmas and all through the house, Sam was dog-fucking his chick.  I don't know.  Oh, you're on her night thing about.  Well, booyah.  A little booyah, yeah.  Although, like, two years ago, while my brother was going to Skidmore, we went up for his graduation. 
[02:28:30]  And we got my parents and Jess and me.  That's where Susan Smith graduated.  Check back your kids in a lake.  The University of Opie's Underwear.  All right, skid jokes out of the way.  All right, continue.  We got kids and shit jokes.  Welcome.  We got a hotel room.  Yeah.  And my dad booked the hotels and did book us a room with two beds. 
[02:29:00]  Why, Lucy and Ricky?  Did he do that?  Yeah.  Two beds.  Jess thought that was naive.  Oh, really?  No, he did that because he knows that you're...  But here's what it was.  Jess was probably on her period and dad's like, look, I know you two are going to ruin this one fucking.  So they need to have a nice clean bed to sleep in after.  Wow, that is nice.  I don't know if he knows your cycle.  Did you wind up sleeping in the same one bed?  We did wind up sleeping in the same...  And did you mess up the other bed?  No, we decided, you know what? 
[02:29:30]  We're going to make a statement and not even bother messing up the other bed.  Oh, so they knew that you slept in the other bed.  Yeah, let them know.  Sam, pull in Jersey because I don't remember.  Can you refresh my memory at your birthday party?  Who won the pin the tail on the donkey?  I forgot.  There were no party games.  I know I came close, but who won?  Yeah.  There were no party games.  No.  Can we talk about the time I was on Romper Room?  Oh.  How's Janine actually? 
[02:30:00]  It just sounds like a Romper Room episode.  It really does.  You have a child's party.  There were no party games.  There was a dinner that Opie came for.  No, no, no.  That wasn't dinner.  It isn't a dinner when it's chicken fingers.  Dude, we had to sit there as Sam opened probably a hundred gifts.  There weren't a hundred gifts.  It was unbelievable.  How awful.  It was all wrestling stuff.  We all had to make believe that we're all like, wow.  I did kind of have the hot flashes coming because I realized Opie's going to sit here when the gifts come and there will be action figures given. 
[02:30:30]  A lot.  That was all that were – I don't remember anything else.  Which one did you get?  Did you get the talking Hulkamaniac that you said if you're over five, you're a faggot for having this?  No, I believe I received a Rhythm and Blues three-pack with Honky Tonk Man, Greg the Hammer Valentine, and Jimmy Hart.  Wow.  And Sam, this all comes from the fact that I'm just jealous.  I mean, you had a very healthy upbringing with very healthy – 
[02:31:00]  A healthy upbringing breastfeeds.  He's not a healthy –  Healthy to a point with two very loving parents that don't make it about themselves.  Thank you.  Well, you know what?  You actually make it about their kids, which was very nice to see.  But they're old school.  What?  They're old school.  Like they think it's like the 50s or something.  Well, the problem is that the mom should have turned it off around 18 or 19, and now that Sam's 32 years old, he's still having kid parties at his mom's house.  I'm 26.  I have my own residence, my own automobile, and so I have this separate thing. 
[02:31:30]  Tell your mother about this.  Once a week, we still –  But you had to go to your mom's, who wasn't there, to get your Easter basket.  Oh, my God.  Easter basket.  Well, there was – I did bring up to her that that was a major slap in the face,  that she was going to visit my brother in Scotland during Easter.  Scotland.  Wow.  Fuck.  That's cool.  It's not cool.  It's Easter.  That is very cool.  Exactly.  So Sam – and Sam's being –  What's he doing in Scotland?  He's bad.  He's probably a landlord for the Lockerbie bomber that was released. 
[02:32:00]  He's studying in Scotland.  He's finishing his studies.  He's studying abroad?  No, he's – he went to a graduate program in Scotland.  Oh, really?  For writing.  I went to Geneseo.  That's the same fucking thing.  All right.  Look up Geneseo and look up fucking a school in Scotland.  That's nice.  Why does he have to go to Scotland?  There's no good schools here?  No, he just – he had an opportunity to –  That's what rich, privileged kids do.  I know.  They go to rich, privileged countries to go to school when –  Right.  There's plenty of schools here in the United States.  What school did you go to, Ant? 
[02:32:30]  The School of Hard Knocks.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  I haven't finished no stinking high school.  He wants to be in writing and had the opportunity to take a one-year writing program in Glasgow,  Scotland.  Ugh.  What's he is?  He's a snob.  Exactly.  What are they teaching Scotland about writing?  No.  Yeah.  Put the fucking pen on the paper.  Put your pen on the fucking paper.  What are you doing? 
[02:33:00]  Wow.  That's a nice opportunity.  Put some ink on the quail, you fucking cunt.  My opportunity was to get my ass to the golf course at 5.30 every morning.  Well, I wouldn't get a loop that day.  You taught yourself radio and you brought yourself up.  Oh, boy.  Look at where you are now.  You're very successful.  I had the same opportunities as a one-year writing program in Scotland.  Yeah, one year to write in Scotland.  Holy shit.  You're very successful.  How are we friends?  I hate you.  If he could be half the writer that you are a radio host, he would be considered very successful. 
[02:33:30]  Then he'd be, Opie would be twice the radio host that he was a writer.  Yeah, but I mean.  If he's a zero as a writer, that would make Opie zero too, because zero times zero is zero.  But he was not going to be zero.  Zero.  Aye.  He's, he's, he's.  What does he write?  He likes to write fiction.  A lot of short stories so far, but he's working on.  And you know what?  There's a Hughes, Hughes-Roberts collaboration that might be happening behind the scenes.  That's true.  What?  Our brothers might be working together, which is a story for another day.  Yes.  That's a story for another day. 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  I don't know how that happened.  Oh, what?  The pinata.  I forgot what shape it was in.  There was no pinata.  I think it was, oh, it was a, it was a WWE World Championship belt pinata.  That we had a fucking, uh, no, there was no pinata.  A hit with a wiffle ball bat, Anthony.  Travis has been to one of my birthday parties, and it was very adult.  Travis?  What?  Were you at one of these, were you at one of the kid parties that, uh, Sam's mom throws for Sam? 
[02:34:30]  If Sam's talking about the party that had the Hulk Hogan, uh, life-size cutout on the door.  Oh!  My mom put that up for irony.  No, she didn't.  Oh, really?  I met your mom.  She thought that would make you happy.  Where's the irony when you are completely a child when it comes to this stupid wrestling?  I want to throw a party for Sam and play Pin the Shotgun on the Temple.  That'll be the big game at the end.  Won't let you pick the games. 
[02:35:00]  No.  You had a great time, though.  Oh, a giant cutout.  I had a, I, no, it was not that one.  It was, it was, it was leftover from like 1991, and so there's the irony.  This was at your birthday party way back then.  All your little Hulksters, come over here.  Here's the party, Hulksters.  All right.  Sam just so threw himself onto the bus, I can't even tell you.  Did you hear what he said?  Leftover, yes.  Yeah.  Because the other thing I learned being at Sam's house is that Sam's mom saves everything  Sam touches.  A hoarder? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, it was a hoarder for her kid's stuff.  Everything.  That's true.  Oh, she saved that from 1991.  No, that's 100% true.  She didn't buy a new one.  100% true.  It was left over.  It was saved in an attic and said, you know what?  I have this from his 1991 kid party.  Why not break it out for the 2009 kid party?  It'll be ironic.  Yeah, and it was.  No, it was not.  Oh.  What else has your mom saved over the years?  I mean, you know, see, in my family, Sam, if you have one disagreement with mommy, your  head is cut out of all the family photos.  Okay, well, that never happened.  My mom actually has. 
[02:36:00]  Did that really happen?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  No disrespect to your birthday party extravaganza.  When you go through photos.  This is interesting.  When you go through photo albums, you realize who mommy was mad at, depending on the picture.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever asked her about the cutting of the head off of photos?  I don't need to be bothered by any of it.  No, we just fucking move on with our lives.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  And let her fucking, you know, be a lonely old woman.  Wow.  Sam, so what's the difference there? 
[02:36:30]  Oh, yeah, that really happened, Jimmy.  Wow.  I mean, my mom has.  I should tweet those photos.  You absolutely should.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's normal behavior.  My mom has piles of photo albums with different albums dedicated to the different siblings.  Oh, really?  I bet yours is the biggest collection, though, right?  She's proud of me.  That's all.  And what is that called?  Does she do some of them?  I wish that was my birthday party.  And host her with a birthday cake and a little party favor in his mouth. 
[02:37:00]  And Mean Gene has a party hat on.  Mean Gene has a, yeah.  Are your photo albums all scrapbooked?  Like, there's all little sayings and little, like, thought bubbles and stuff.  Each photo has a little sticky with a description and a date of what was going on in the photo.  I'm telling you, dude.  It's unbelievable.  Wow.  You've got to go over there one time.  No disrespect.  I'm like, whatever, man.  I bet your mom has a lot of rage built up in her.  Oh.  That just doesn't ever come out.  And it's always a smile and doing things for her little Sam.  And she is. 
[02:37:30]  Meanwhile, at night, she goes online and looks at blacks and blondes porn.  That's understandable.  But it has to play out.  It has to play out somewhere.  Yeah, it really does.  It has to play out somewhere.  My mom is also.  She was the head of the Cub Scouts.  Of course she was.  For three years.  Of course.  For three years after me and my brother had left Cub Scouts.  There were none of her children.  Of course she was.  The head of the Cub Scouts.  And have you ever heard, like, your mom get mad?  Does she get mad?  No, but she has. 
[02:38:00]  I will.  She will.  I mean.  Well, no.  She did used to get mad when I was younger.  Because I would mouth off.  And she would open hand slap me in the front of the mouth.  Good.  Well, I bet it was like.  Is that why your lips are so big?  No.  It was still a little bit hard.  That's a different reason.  See, I gave you an out, Sam.  I bet it was a little tap.  Like nothing.  It wasn't hard.  Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  What's your middle name?  My middle name is Wood.  Why Wood?  No, it's not.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  W-O-O-D is my middle name.  Sam Wood Roberts.  It took you five years to get to that.  But yeah.  Samuel Wood Roberts.  Are you kidding me?  Wow.  W-O-O-D is my middle name.  Why?  People are laughing at you.  Who's that?  I don't know, but they're laughing at you.  Why are you laughing?  Who are you?  Holy shit.  You look familiar.  Who is she?  Who is that girl?  She's lovely.  I hope I have a fart brewing.  Who are you?  Why don't you open the door?  Kenny's asking him.  Kenny's doing some reconnaissance.  Sam, when did you stop breastfeeding?  Be honest.  I don't even know if I was breastfed, to tell you the truth. 
[02:39:00]  That's not even a name.  That's a thing.  Your mom didn't fucking breastfeed you?  Of course she did.  I'm not sure.  I don't think.  She might not have.  Could you find out for us?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  For sure.  Sam Wood.  I believe my-  Why Wood?  My grand-  I think my grandfather's-  My mom's grandfather's name.  Kenny chased him away.  Kenny, all right.  There's a-  Get in here immediately, Kenny.  What was that about?  You chased him away, Kenny?  Why didn't they come in?  Who is that?  The Broad is on Versus, the TV channel.  Doing what?  What does she do?  And she doesn't want to come on our show?  No, she does.  Because now she's marching down the hall. 
[02:39:30]  I told her to see the producer.  You want to get her in here?  What show is she on?  Yeah, why would she see the producer?  Why don't we just bring her in?  Yeah, what show is she on?  We wanted her in now.  No, Versus.  Oh, geez.  She's talking to Steve.  Find out what that whore does.  Yeah, go get her.  We wanted her on the air.  She doesn't go through proper channels.  We didn't need her to go through proper channels.  She was laughing, so she was going to bring her in for a second.  Kenny, Kenny-  All right.  Are we done?  I like to wear wrestling clothing.  I am Sam Wood.  It's Sam Wood Roberts.  I am Sam Wood.  Lost my apparently is in the water. 
[02:40:00]  The only difference between Sam and Ed was that Ed contributed more to his art.  No, it's just not.  This is the one they're going to remember me.  I look better in a dress, too.  Thank you.  Hi.  Hi, beautiful woman.  Hey.  Now, you look familiar, so I apologize that I don't know you.  You're on Versus?  I'm on Versus starting today.  Starting today?  Joke's on them.  They gave me a show. 
[02:40:30]  What exactly is Versus?  Versus is starting a new show called The Daily Line.  It's basically like if they did like five bong hits before SportsCenter, it's probably what  it would come across as.  Oh, it's a football team.  No, it's everything sports.  Wait, you know sports?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Versus is a sports thing.  Yeah, Versus is a sports thing.  Big hockey channel, outdoor life, hunting.  They play a lot of Islander games on Channel 122, I think, Versus here in the city.  Where are you from?  Florida.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  You look nice and tan.  Yeah, actually up here everybody accuses me of being from the Jersey Shore, so this is  quite a switch.  So wait, why don't you have the big boobies?  I used to.  You had them taken out?  Yeah, you guys don't know about this?  Now you're folding your arms?  No.  No, I used to.  I used to have 34.  We're supposed to know everything about you?  I used to have 34 double Ds.  What happened?  I took them out.  Just couldn't deal with it anymore?  Just got tired of it.  You had the back problems.  Were they, you were born naturally or you had implants that had the implants removed?  Oh, no.  She wasn't born.  Yeah, of course she was. 
[02:41:30]  She's a small little petite girl.  So I, uh, no, I went to Florida State.  So you wanted that much attention that you had big, huge boobs?  Exactly.  Well, no.  I mean, I'm not even trying to be a jerk, but you must have been looking for attention  to get 34 double Ds on that small body of yours.  I bought them for me and I was just, it was just one of those things, a decision I made  when I was like a month shy of 20 and absolutely loved them.  They were a blast while I had them.  Well, how tall are you?  You're like five.  I'm five foot nothing.  I'm like five two.  That's what I'm saying.  Five two and you're barely a hundred. 
[02:42:00]  You're cute.  A little over a hundred, 110 maybe tops.  110.  I'm pretty muscular.  So 34 double Ds is what I'm saying would be just pretty.  I'm from down South.  You go big or you go home.  Were you dancing or anything?  Uh, no.  No?  No.  Dad would have kicked my ass for that one.  Just saying.  All right.  So how'd you get involved with sports and stuff?  Sports?  I was at Florida State and I was discovered at a football game back in like 2005.  Because of your big boobs?  Exactly.  No, I'm not even joking.  I was in the front row in a bathing suit top and Brent Musburger said 1500 red-blooded young 
[02:42:30]  American men just signed up to go to Florida State.  Because, you know, that's what happens when they put perverts in the booth.  Is there pictures of your big boobs online?  Yeah.  Oh, we got to see this.  How do we get there?  I did, uh, like within like the first, um.  How do we get there?  Jen Sturger Playboy?  I don't know.  You were a Playboy?  Yeah.  Oh, see, we don't know any of this shit.  I did Playboy and I did Maxim.  God, they didn't even prep you guys at all.  No, they were just like, oh, cute girl in the hallway.  Come in here.  That's pretty much how we do it.  Do you know what you're walking into?  And I was like, yeah, I know what I'm walking into. 
[02:43:00]  No, we saw you laughing outside the studio, so we were like, bring her in.  Uh, Playboy.  It's regret spelled backwards.  How sick of a joke is that?  Really?  That's easy to remember, though.  That's crazy.  Goddamn, that works out good.  No, it doesn't.  No, I mean, it's just easy.  How do you explain that to future ex-boyfriends?  It's easy.  You got a boyfriend?  No.  What happened?  It would be G.  Why, what happened?  G-E-R.  I just...  G-E-R day.  Too busy.  Men in New York are hard to date.  No?  Wait, what's the reason why?  Yeah, yeah, okay.  Um, I'm just used to being treated like, you know... 
[02:43:30]  What?  A little spoiled?  Yeah.  Hold on, Anne.  Look at this picture.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Put your fucking boobs back in your body.  Oh, stop.  Holy shit.  I was making fun that you went too big.  Fuck, Dad.  Look at this...  Let me see.  Wow-wee.  No, this...  Very nice.  I think I like the...  Just natural.  Thank you.  She's naked in that one right there.  She's naked in that one right there.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  I found that since I took them out, my butt gets the attention it deserves now.  Oh, my Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Yes.  Is that your natural boobs? 
[02:44:00]  You have a really nice ass.  Hard to tell on that angle.  Which one?  No, those are double Ds.  That doesn't look like double Ds from that angle.  The Playboy shot?  Has to be with...  I don't know.  Those are my first set of implants.  Okay.  Wow.  They're not 34 doubles.  No.  Those are 34 CDs.  Yeah, that's what it is.  And that's why I felt like my butt was not getting enough attention, so I had to take  them out.  And you know what?  Since then, the butt's definitely gotten more complex.  Yeah.  I prefer this look just natural.  I prefer...  What do you have?  Like, do you have Bs?  Are they Bs?  They're like full Bs.  I prefer that. 
[02:44:30]  Honestly, I prefer that a lot.  Well, I'm still in really good shape.  Like, I'm actually smaller now than I was then.  Can I ask you a real personal question?  So, you get the 34 double Ds out.  Sure.  Did it make your chest like a nightmare and you had to have...  You know what I mean?  Was it...  No, you know what's funny?  If we saw you topless, would it look good?  Yeah, there's no nightmare.  There's no nightmare situation going on.  Well, because the skin was stretched and all that and...  Yeah, oddly enough, I don't have implants now.  I have these things called...  We're going to really go into this.  Xenographs.  What is that? 
[02:45:00]  It's essentially an expensive word for bacon.  Bacon?  Nice.  No muzzles, no sucker tits.  Yeah, it's really expensive bacon.  What does that mean?  Fat injections or something?  Pig tissue.  What?  Pig tissue.  You have pig tissue in your chest?  Yeah.  Is that healthy?  If I lay out long enough, you start smelling it.  Is that healthy?  It's plenty healthy, yeah.  It's clinically treated pig tissue.  Wow.  It works kind of like fat? 
[02:45:30]  Well, it kind of just replaces anything that I may have lost.  Deflated.  Because I didn't have...  Well, I didn't have a ton of breast tissue because I worked out once I got the implants.  Right.  So I didn't really have a lot of breast tissue left when they went in there and took everything out.  Everybody wants to see your pictures online.  So what's your name again?  It's Jen Sturger.  Jen Sturger.  It's Sterger.  Sterger.  Yeah.  S-T-E-R-G-E-R.  Cool.  Have fun with that, guys.  You're tired?  Make sure...  If you're at work, NSFW.  So what are you going to do for Versus?  So you said it's a sports show, but it's like if you did a few hits before. 
[02:46:00]  You know, I worked...  When I came up here, I was working for the Jets doing sideline reporting.  Before that, I worked for SI.com and did a lot of stuff for them.  Did some stuff for ABC, for College Hoops.  That was my primary background.  I love football, but I was making all my money in college basketball, oddly enough.  So I started working with Versus back in October on this show concept, and they were just like,  we want to take the typical sports show and put it in a totally new direction.  And it's very much like it integrates all the new social media and not like in a Sports Nation type way where it just comes across as really cheesy. 
[02:46:30]  It's more the fan actually has a voice in the show, and I know that's totally a cliche thing to say at this point in time because everyone's trying to do it.  But the show that has really worked hard on making it seem like it's all real time.  It's a live show.  It's not taped, so it's not like you're getting tweets that happened last night and messages that happened last night.  I'm sitting there, and I'm getting bombarded, one, with marriage proposals and stalkers, and two, with guys who genuinely have a love for sports and very strong sports opinions. 
[02:47:00]  So it's pretty sweet.  Who wins tonight, Duke or Butler?  I am taking Butler to the dance, and I'm probably going home with Duke.  So I mean I really – I'm pulling for Butler in this one just because I love an underdog story.  Yeah, of course.  And everyone does.  Plus I'm an ACC girl, so I used to torture Duke on the side of the court all the time.  So Butler – hold on. 
[02:47:30]  I don't know anything about college sports.  Butler is like a big underdog, right?  Yeah.  Were they not supposed to be there this year?  They said the quote-unquote mid-majors is what they keep referring to it as, and the coach keeps getting very offended by it.  She knows a lot about sports.  What's a mid – I never heard that term before.  Yeah, they just went over this, right?  What is mid-majors?  Mid-majors is just – it's lower than obviously the standard rest of the big dogs that are in there right now.  It's not your one seed.  But Butler – I don't know why everyone's so blown away that Butler got as far as they did in the tournament, you know,  because they really – honestly, they deserve it. 
[02:48:00]  Why didn't we make an E-Rock joke when she was talking about her bacon tits?  An E-Rock?  We didn't think of it.  Because E-Rock's got bacon – you want to see another person that has bacon tits?  Sure, bring it up.  But it's in a whole different context.  Are you going to make some 4G cry?  Is this an intern or something?  No, no, no.  No, he's worked with us for quite some time.  He's got – he's got –  What time is your show on?  Six to seven live.  Six to seven live.  Pretty crazy.  On Versus.  Where's Versus? 
[02:48:30]  Where's Versus?  Yeah, like what channel is it?  Oh, God.  I don't know all the different channels.  XM or Serious or both?  No, it's TV.  No, it's TV.  Oh, okay.  Honey, you don't put me on radio.  Let's be real.  Well, you're in – oh, so you're promoting your show.  See, because we're ugly and you're hot.  Give her a visual medium.  Aw.  Absolutely.  McNabb going to the Redskins, huh?  Yeah.  You know what, though?  I see that the same way.  Why would you trade him with –  I don't even know why –  To one of your rivals.  There's E-Rock. 
[02:49:00]  He – just look at his tits so he can go back to work.  Oh, that's so mean.  All right, E-Rock, go back to work.  I'm sorry.  E-Rock, are you embarrassed?  Nah.  She got her tits.  Well, she said she had fucking bacon boobs, so we –  I'll show mine if she shows her.  Oh, now we're talking.  Let me do that, trust me.  Look at that, E-Rock.  You have to go legit?  You can't show your boobies anymore?  Yeah, I can't show my boobs anymore.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  All right, well, it was nice talking to you.  You're like, why did we bring her in here again? 
[02:49:30]  Nah, you were –  We need more women in here.  You were cool, actually.  Glad you came in.  So, all right, what time is it on?  Six to seven on Versus.  Tonight, okay.  Yep.  Check your local cable provider.  It's me and three comedians, so apparently they thought I was funny.  Oh, really?  Well, Reese Waters is the one.  He's actually running around the studio right now.  I don't know Reese.  It's one of the news.  Who else?  He's the token.  Oh, black guy?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  All right.  And who else?  Liam McHugh.  He did a lot of more sports-based news.  And then Rob DeAngelis.  That's the cool part of our show, too, is we have a handicapper. 
[02:50:00]  And we're very blunt about how to use it.  So that's kind of cool.  Yeah, I mean, you know, betting.  It's illegal, but –  Yeah, sure.  We don't necessarily bet on the show, nor do we encourage it.  But you just say if people want to, this is what the odds are to say.  Technically speaking.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm still hung up on the fact that she doesn't have a boyfriend, and I'm kind of looking like,  like, why?  Why?  I don't understand how, you know. 
[02:50:30]  I'm just too busy for it, honestly.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  And I find, like, a lot of the guys up here are just very self-serving and very egotistical.  Yeah, I find that, too.  Oh, really?  Where do you live?  Hoboken.  Oh, really?  No, you're a dress.  You're close.  No, you're a dress.  Hoboken, yeah.  Yeah, it's real chill.  It reminds me a lot of college.  Yeah?  It's everyone's between the ages of, you know, 21 and 32, and they're all usually –  You have no time? 
[02:51:00]  You can't find any time to go out or anything?  You don't find any time for social life?  You know what?  It's just that my type doesn't include people that GTL on a regular basis.  What's that?  Jim Tan Laundry.  You don't watch The Jersey Shore?  Oh, I see.  I don't remember that.  I don't watch it very often, but I watched it for, like, two seconds, and I was just  like, I'm now dumber for watching this.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I don't date because of that show.  Because that is what I'm surrounded by.  So what do you look for in a guy?  What would be a nice night out for you?  A nice night out? 
[02:51:30]  Honestly, I'm a dive bar kind of girl.  I don't like clubs.  I don't really do a lot of drinking or partying.  I could if there's just something good on TV and a few characters just talking at the  bar.  A couple of beers, and you could just hang out and kind of overhear some conversation.  That's why I like my show.  That's what it feels like.  That's the same kind of thing.  God, me and you, I feel something here.  You could be my future ex-husband.  I see this.  As long as there is the, you know, portion between now and the ex part, that's fine by me. 
[02:52:00]  You're just sitting back, relaxing, watching a movie on an 11-foot screen in somebody's  house where there's guns all over.  Right, I do have a theater.  He's shy.  He doesn't want to mention.  He has a movie theater in his house.  You don't know if you know this, but I'm kind of a big deal.  People know me.  Oh, I know, yeah.  He wouldn't say that.  Me, too.  He has books that smell like rich mahogany, too.  Great.  He has a gentleman's house.  Another good one.  Nice.  I am quite a gentleman.  No, no, it's actually set up very nice as a, it's a large house.  You'd think a family would live there, but I just pound around there alone. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Yes, that is my movie theater.  Yes.  I like how you don't have any friends sitting around you.  Friends I consider pesky.  You know, you don't need a lot of friends.  Me, too.  Anthony just hires black people to sit, and he can throw them out for talking.  For talking.  I was just having that conversation with someone the other day, because they wanted to go see  how I got, or why I got married, too, or the new funeral movie.  Exactly.  I'm like, I can't go to those movies. 
[02:53:00]  And I'm like, I don't want people screaming at the movie theater.  Yeah.  The entire time.  You say quiet.  Or if you're in a scary movie.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like, oh, don't go in there.  You crazy white girl.  They'll just start screaming.  Yes, exactly.  It's always a problem.  Oh, I riff on Reese all the time about it.  Not at your house?  No, no, no.  No.  Not at my house.  They get kicked out.  Yeah, and I have a bar down there, too.  What's your poison?  What do you like to drink?  I don't drink a ton, but when I do, I usually am sticking to, like, beer.  Just beer, yeah?  Yeah.  What do you like? 
[02:53:30]  Like, regular light beer, or?  Yeah, just regular.  Why are you showing me him holding lots of weapons?  That's supposed to entice me.  Hey, that's a funny picture.  Stop it.  That was photoshopped.  He doesn't actually own that gun.  He's like, come over.  I'm wearing my toys.  No one owns a gun like that, obviously.  That would be crazy.  Put my bar up there.  What are you trying to do, you cock blocker?  He's holding a rifle, a rifle, and a free Cuba pamphlet.  He's like, does this look like someone you can trust when he spins the screen to me?  I need to help out my pal, Anthony.  Okay?  Anthony, little known fact, is a huge sports fan, loves college basketball. 
[02:54:00]  Really?  Anthony, tell her what you know about college basketball.  Look, I can't even talk college basketball.  He won't brag.  What about baseball?  Well, I, yeah, yeah.  I was a little disappointed last night.  Yeah, I can imagine.  Especially after jumping up.  It's early.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, please.  They have what?  You know what?  Six, seven games left.  Things could be worse.  You could be a Mets fan.  That is true.  Get out.  Half the team is injured.  Get out!  Half the team is injured.  God, I think we have a lot in common.  I think we'd probably have fun if we just kind of win out. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, we'll just have to have one of the guys set it up.  Yeah, I guess we will.  No, one of the guys will have to set it up.  Well, why wouldn't you maybe go out to, like, you know, a nice...  I'll have my people.  Do you know how to work an iPhone?  You don't even know who my people are.  Do you know how to work an iPhone?  Bring the hot chicken from the hallway.  Do you know how to work an iPhone?  Not really.  Give her your iPhone so she can maybe, you know, put her number in there.  No, I can feel these things, Obie.  Yeah, I can feel these things.  I don't know. 
[02:55:00]  Maybe the truth is the reason I don't have a boyfriend is because I might be a lesbian.  I haven't decided yet, but that's what I'm thinking.  How many women have you been with?  None.  There's always a first time.  See, that was a joke.  There's always a hot chick that you think you go, maybe...  I had that experience a couple weeks ago.  Well, I could help you out there, too.  I'll drag some over the house.  Whatever you need.  Seriously, do you like women?  No, I find women attractive, but I don't like women like that.  When you're watching porn, do you like to watch guy-girl scenes, or do you like girl-girl scenes?  I watch whatever's the most viewed on RedTube. 
[02:55:30]  So you can watch girl-girl scenes?  Because normally, that's what everybody else is watching, so it's got to have something good in it, right?  So you like girl-girl.  I want to play Ant's Last Card.  He has a giant Italian hog.  He does, though.  Yeah.  He has a giant Italian hog.  Huge.  His penis.  His penis is fucking big.  Do I look Italian?  Is that supposed to entice me?  Are you?  Well, I'm just saying Italian, because he's Italian.  He's just...  Oh, you really?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, this will make me feel better. 
[02:56:00]  I hope that...  Have you ever been with a black man?  No.  Or I just...  Damn it, I was hoping she'd say yes, so then I could just go, okay, forget it.  Yeah.  But then again, she did earlier say her father would kill her for the one thing.  I'm an equal opportunity dater, but I just can't...  I don't know.  That's just something I haven't delved into yet.  Yeah, that's a big line to cross right there.  Exactly.  See?  Now we have something else in common.  Racism.  No, I'm not.  I'm not at all.  I'm definitely not at all.  I just... 
[02:56:30]  You know, I just...  Yeah.  I'm from down south.  Like, I have a little southern grandmother.  Like, try explaining that to her.  Yeah.  That'll be rough.  You'd hear some...  You'd hear some words.  Oh, I have no doubt about it.  Trust me.  Oh, uh-oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just...  I don't know.  You're not feeling it at?  No, I wish I was, you know?  Yeah.  Because she's very cute and everything, and I think we'd probably laugh.  I love how they, like, pulled the curtains closed, and then I got in here, like, I was  going to get naked.  No, it was just a show.  Can we work in this corporate environment? 
[02:57:00]  We can't even, like, have nude shit on our screens without having the curtains.  Yeah.  What a buzzkill.  Yeah, I would like to say, because we thought we were going to get you naked, but no.  Even if we have naked stuff on our computers, that has to go up.  Oh.  Damn.  That makes, you know, radio fun.  People are...  At least I'm feeling some sympathy from the listeners that say, wow, Anthony just got  shot down in front of so many people.  Wow.  Yeah, that was a bad one.  No, but at least you saw it coming this time.  I usually...  Unlike the other times. 
[02:57:30]  No, the other times I've gotten numbers, at least, and stuff.  At least you saw this one coming, so it wasn't that awkward for everybody.  Yeah, I know.  I thought, you know...  Whatever happened to the lingerie football girl?  I never called her.  Why didn't you?  He's just cock-bocking himself at this point in time.  No, I was waiting for somebody like you to walk into my life.  Attaboy, Ange.  Child, please.  Attaboy.  Attaboy.  If only I could say it with a straight face. 
[02:58:00]  All right, so we've got to take a break.  Versus is the channel.  Versus.  It's six to seven every night on Versus.  Six to seven, yeah.  Monday through Friday, that's going to be a lot of work.  I know, but I'm up for it.  She can't stop me from jerking off to her show.  Exactly.  Way to go out in style.  You know, might as well hit the old detonation button.  If you're going to go down, you might as well go down swinging.  Lots of recklessly abandoned children between six and seven.  I'm kamikaze-ing this plane.  God.  I still think that you had a shot with her. 
[02:58:30]  I think that she's shy on the air, and she didn't know how to accept your invitation to dinner.  Yeah, why'd you turn down Anthony?  Was it the fact that he has reading glasses now?  I don't have reading glasses.  Oh, that's not nice.  Oh.  No, I have a crush on this one guy right now, but that is an issue.  He's much older than I am.  Well, how much older?  Like, if he had tried to date me when he was a senior in high school, he'd be sitting in a kitchen with Chris Hansen.  Oh, gosh. 
[02:59:00]  You know what I'm saying?  That's young.  I'd be sitting with a zygote.  You don't know young.  He'd be sitting with some guy's balls who hasn't met a wife yet.  Yeah, you don't know age difference.  Can we leave my father's balls out of this conversation?  That'd be great.  There's certain images I don't want in my head, and that happens to be one of them.  How old are you?  Are you 24?  Oh, you're sweet.  Now I'm 26.  Okay.  So that guy's probably like 44, 42 that she likes?  40? 
[02:59:30]  No, no.  I don't.  No, I'm younger.  I don't go that.  Not that high.  No, yeah.  But still old enough where it's like, maybe.  Here it comes.  You know why?  Because she has a good relationship with her father, right?  My dad's a cool dude.  So no daddy issues.  No, he's not.  No, not at all.  I need a girl with daddy issues.  He's not the Jessica Simpson, Joe Simpson kind of guy either.  He's just the type of dude that I can go out with and drink with.  Because he got, I think he was very disappointed I wasn't a boy.  Talk sports.  Exactly.  That's how Sam's parents feel. 
[03:00:00]  I was raised going to ballparks all the time with my dad, like for vacations and stuff.  He wanted a boy.  Yeah, very badly.  And that's why I drive a Shelby GT500.  That's like my, I'm fast cars and sports.  You know anything about the Shelby?  Let me think.  I drive a Shelby GT500.  No, you don't.  You want to see a picture?  Go ahead.  Pop that fucker up.  There it is.  There's my car.  It's actually a super snake now.  That's in a car show. 
[03:00:30]  Your car and my car could date.  They have some beautiful children.  That's funny.  Your car could fuck her car.  That's as far as you're getting.  Exactly.  But my car has side pipes that might be a little tricky, but.  Mine's a super snake.  I sent it out to Vegas to, it's 720 horse now.  I've been out there, actually.  I was out there in October at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and their shops are right out  there.  It's pretty sick.  It is really.  I got to ride in the two-seater IndyCar, which if you have a chance to do it, it's the  most amazing experience ever.  Oh man, so you're on the side that goes like right against the wall? 
[03:01:00]  Oh yeah.  And the worst part is Marco Andretti was driving mine, the same guy that crashed in lap one  turn one, um, last year in the 500s, so, um, last year in the 500s, so.  I was like, Marco, if you could stop texting long enough to just get me around the track  a couple times.  You could text in an IndyCar?  Jesus.  Yeah, he definitely was.  Him and, uh, Tony Kanaan were actually, like, videotaping going around the track and  posting it to their Twitter accounts, no joke.  I cannot even imagine how much we have in common and I'm just fucking sitting here in a flaming 
[03:01:30]  pit of aviation fuel.  Hey, do you know, um, my God, you know, a place called the Cafe Cabernet in Tallahassee?  Yeah.  Florida?  Mm-hmm.  What about it?  Somebody saying something?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Why, what is somebody writing to you?  Do you maybe make out with a chick there in the bathroom once?  No.  Mm-hmm.  That was, no.  Oh.  Definitely not.  That's what the listeners, come on.  I'm just asking. 
[03:02:00]  Allegedly.  All right, she said no.  I mean, we all experiment in college, right?  Well, not all of us.  Sam did.  Sam.  I didn't care.  Sam kisses men.  It was a lot.  A lot.  Yeah, Sam sucked at college in college because he was very experimental.  Oh, my God.  I kissed three men.  Yeah, he did kiss three men.  Me too.  What a coincidence.  Recently.  Sam has kissed three men.  Yes, I kissed three men and it was not a big deal.  One was, yeah, two were homeless.  One was homeless, one was a comedian, and the other was intern David.  Really?  Who was the comedian?  Robert Kelly. 
[03:02:30]  You wouldn't know him.  No.  Do you know him?  No, just making sure it wasn't the guy that I have a crush on.  Oh, it's a comedian?  Yeah.  But now you say, I don't know the comics you're talking about.  Are they comedians for real or are they just funny guys?  How big?  For the show?  Yeah, yeah.  No, Reese has won quite a few awards.  Oh, you said that, okay.  Yeah, he does.  But the crush you have is on a comedian not doing the show?  He won the Friars Club competition last year.  Oh, okay.  Did a couple of stints at comics. 
[03:03:00]  Comedy Central.  Did some stuff for HBO.  He's pretty good.  What comic do you have a crush on?  I can't tell you that.  Is it a real name?  He doesn't know.  Yeah, he doesn't know I have a crush on.  Is it Dane?  It's probably Dane Cook.  No, it's not Dane.  All right, so wait.  Let's find out.  Dane is too pretty.  I bet you it's Louis C.K.  No, Louis C.K. doesn't fit her.  Is it Colin Quinn?  As long as it's not Keith Robinson or Patrice O'Neill or Wilson Vince.  She just said ew to Colin Quinn.  She literally went ew.  That's not nice.  Good girl. 
[03:03:30]  Well, you know, she's not a beauty of chasing Indy cars.  What would a beautiful girl like me?  You guys make the same sound that meh.  I don't know.  Apparently I'm not running into the wall.  All right, so the comedian you have a crush on.  Bob Nelson?  Holy shit, really?  David knows.  You said Bob Nelson.  No.  He, um...  You don't even know who Bob Nelson is.  Is he on TV?  Yeah.  Do you know him personally?  Yes.  Okay, he's been on TV.  Does he have his own show or has he just made a lot of TV appearances?  No, I think he's got his own show. 
[03:04:00]  If you have a crush on him and he hasn't been with you...  Wait, he has his own show on TV right now?  And you're friends.  He's either gay or married and in a really good marriage.  No.  Is he on Comedy Central?  No.  No?  Are we playing Guess Who here?  No, we're just curious.  We're not going to Yes, but it won't be a Yes, but he's not...  He's flipping down all the cards in front of you.  You know what I'm talking about?  He's not on Comedy Central or he is?  He's on a TV show right now?  Yeah.  But he's not on Comedy Central.  No.  Are you lying?  No.  Okay.  HBO?  Network TV?  No.  Network? 
[03:04:30]  No.  Not Network, not HBO, not Comedy Central.  What does he do, a podcast he's got?  Yes.  What do you...  I'm not telling.  Why not?  Why?  What's wrong with you?  He probably knows anyway.  Comedians are very perceptive.  We probably know him and can help you out a little bit.  No.  She knows him.  Daniel Tosh?  Somehow I don't see you guys helping my situation.  Hindering maybe, but not helping.  I thought Daniel Tosh too, because of Comedy Central.  How about Dave Attell?  No.  Oh, he doesn't have a show on right now.  No.  Is he into sports? 
[03:05:00]  No word, George.  Of course.  He's a sports guy that does comedy?  No, he's not a sports guy.  Bill Burr?  Oh my God.  Is it Bill Burr?  I'd rather talk about my boobs than talk about this.  Why not?  Is it Bill Burr?  This makes me more nervous than talking about getting naked.  No.  Bill Burr is...  No.  Great guy.  He's very sweet.  No.  I have no idea who you guys are talking about, but...  Oh.  That makes me happy.  Yeah.  Every comic likes when you don't know the other comic.  Sorry.  I'm trying to think.  Okay.  No.  No. 
[03:05:30]  That's Bill Burr.  That's his glamour shot.  That's the seductive Bill Burr.  Yes.  Look into those eyes.  Pensive.  Thoughtful Bill.  Dear Lord.  So has he ever done an HBO special or a Comedy Central special?  I'm not going here with you guys.  How about a Comedy Central special?  Every comic has done one.  Probably, yeah.  I don't stalk him like that.  I don't know.  You might have seen him.  Where did you first see him?  On TV or in person?  Worked with him.  Young guy?  Worked with him.  Damn.  He's older than me.  We've talked about this.  Damn.  Google that shit.  He's probably in his 30s. 
[03:06:00]  Just trying to trip you up.  She worked with him.  She worked with him.  She's done now.  We got it.  You will never find it.  She just slipped.  How did you work with him?  Well, he must know then.  If you worked with him.  I tried to holler.  Yeah, I did.  All right.  So he already knows.  But I got shot down.  Like, it was that awkward.  You know, that whole thing that just happened?  It was right there.  I don't know.  See how it feels.  Maybe he likes the...  Oh, my God.  Ah, shit.  Oh, is he a mole?  You don't know.  Is he a mole?  I'll tell you if he's gay, I'll probably know him.  A homosexual.  A homosexual.  Joel McHale?  I love the voice. 
[03:06:30]  Joel McHale?  No, but it's funny you mention that.  Jay Moores?  Jay Moores.  Oh, yeah.  Jay has a TV show.  Well, Jay knows sports.  No.  Yes, he does.  And he has a TV show.  Jay Moores.  You guys are really working hard on this.  Yeah, we really are.  No, it's no one on Z-Rock.  And he's not a comedian.  Oh, damn.  He is filthy.  Whoa.  Who's that?  Oh.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Fill in the blank.  He was filthy?  Who?  Yeah.  On Z-Rock?  Dave Navarro.  He's not a comedian, though.  No, he's not a comedian. 
[03:07:00]  No, but the guys on Z-Rock, actually, like the regular guys, they're hysterical.  I really enjoyed working with them.  They're funny.  What'd you do on Z-Rock?  Just a guest appearance.  I was Navarro's arm piece.  Oh, okay.  You know, that was back when I had the giant jugs, so it could only be a couple of things.  The hot girl by the pool.  The hot girl with the rock star.  Or the hot girl with no shirt on.  You know, those are the three roles you can have.  Joe Rogan?  No.  Adam Carolla?  No.  You guys are really going after me hard on this one. 
[03:07:30]  Why not?  It's only a crush.  It's not like you slept with a guy.  If you slept with a guy, then I could see you being a driver.  John Stewart.  Not yet.  But he knows you like him.  Of course.  So you like a guy who's a comic.  Why is it bad to say who it is?  Shot her down.  That's fine.  Because there's always that fear of rejection.  Even hot girls have a fear of rejection.  Of course they do.  But I mean, you've been already shot down, kind of.  And you're already just throwing it out there that you kind of like the guy.  I'm sure he knows.  There's no way he doesn't know.  If you already tried to possibly talk to him, you already know.  I mean, it's not like I was shot down.  It was just like circumstances come up, you know. 
[03:08:00]  And like he's busy with work.  I'm busy with work.  That's why I haven't really had a serious boyfriend in a while.  Okay.  That's why.  It's got to be Gallagher.  Yes, exactly.  Gallagher.  It's either Gallagher or Patrick Rupert.  That's what happened to her breasts.  Gallagher hit him with the mallet.  Oh, my God.  It's not Richard Jenny, is it?  He got bad news.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  I got to pee badly.  Now I want to know them.  I got to pee badly, too, Jimmy.  Oh, tinkle.  Sure.  Is that what they're calling it these days?  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  A couple of men standing there.  Thank you so much, though, for letting me come in here and jaw with you guys this morning.  No problem.  Yeah, you're very pretty, and you seem very sweet.  Seven to eight.  Little do you know.  You have a good car.  Nice car.  And when the show gets canceled, you'll have her right where you need her.  Oh, shit.  You're so mean.  Is it one of the guys you work with now?  He's the cynical one in the group.  No.  No?  You don't ever shit where you eat.  Can you say that on Sirius?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, you can.  You don't ever shit where you eat. 
[03:09:00]  Sometimes you don't.  You can't.  I normally don't.  Depends.  Because it'll always come back to bite you in the butt.  It really will.  Because then when it doesn't work out, it's more likely not going to work out.  Yeah.  So, when it doesn't work out, it makes me a very awkward situation.  No.  Who's that?  She's getting mad.  Oh, is Dimitri?  Okay.  It's Dimitri.  No.  Yeah, I can see their face.  It's Dimitri.  Yeah, and Dimitri is in his 30s?  No.  Lisa Lampanelli?  He has a show.  Chelsea Handler? 
[03:09:30]  I am, when I'm not scared that my father may be listening, because he likes your show,  I am, yes, that's my type completely.  He's showed me a picture of Wanda Sykes.  Wanda Sykes?  That's funny.  I have to pee.  I met her at a WNBA game, actually, once.  Yeah.  Surprise, right?  Wow.  Well, all right.  So, I think it's Dimitri.  That's my opinion.  I'm guessing it's Dimitri.  All right, we've got to take a leak, for real.  So, thank you for coming in.  Thanks, guys.  Good luck with the show.  Good luck.  Versus 6 o'clock.  Look for it at your local cable provider, I guess. 
[03:10:00]  Exactly.  I don't know where that is now.  Whatever it is.  Come in and see us again, all right?  I will, for sure.  Next time, I'll make sure I'm wearing a good push-up bra for you guys.  You look good.  You know how that is good.  I like it.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with this petite.  This is a sports bra.  I've got to tame them down.  I prefer this look.  Not that you care what I prefer, but that's what I prefer.  There's nothing wrong with the small boobs.  Really?  Nothing at all.  Yes.  For real.  Now we get serious.  You guys aren't boob guys.  Very nice to ask.  You go through a boob stage, sure.  But then you grow up a little bit. 
[03:10:30]  That's what my friends have all told me.  They're like, guys in their 20s love boobs.  There's nothing wrong with it.  But men in their 30s and 40s, they appreciate other things.  Yeah, because men in their 30s and 40s are typically with women in their 30s and 40s whose breasts fall.  To the sides.  But they do.  Before the ass does.  So the breasts don't last as long as the ass does.  Yeah, you realize that.  There's more longevity in having a good butt.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, let's see the butt.  Absolutely.  She does have a really nice hair.  Yeah, it's really nice.  That's your money maker right there.  Don't worry about the boobs.  I'll just shake my money maker somewhere. 
[03:11:00]  I'd follow that for 30 blocks.  Thanks, guys.  Crumbling, making noises.  All right.  Nice meeting you.  What's that one word you use on the subway?  Would you do that to her?  I forgot the...  I maced a guy on the subway last week.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Why'd you mace him?  He grabbed me.  How'd he grab you?  Yeah, I hadn't missed my birth.  Where did he grab you?  He grabbed your ass or grabbed your arm?  Grabbed my arm, was telling me.  He's like, oh my God, did you have fun in California?  Because he was stalking me, apparently, online.  And I was like, uh, who are you? 
[03:11:30]  Let go of my hand.  Oh, wow.  He didn't do it, so he got a little bit.  Damn.  Nice.  And that caused him to let go?  Oh, yeah.  Good.  Good for you.  Mace will mess up someone's day.  Good for you.  Fucking nice.  Can you mace Iraq for us today?  I don't know if I have.  I know.  Iraq.  Don't get maced.  Iraq.  We'll all be fucked.  Iraq, do you want to get maced today?  Really?  No.  He was just saying he doesn't think it works.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No.  Could you give Iraq a squirt of mace?  That's all right.  I'm good.  I don't think he wants it, trust me. 
[03:12:00]  He took grape juice.  He could take mace.  Yeah, you could take mace, Iraq.  Come on.  You did the cinnamon challenge.  Wait, so he's the one that you guys always torture?  Yeah.  Well, he's...  Yeah.  He misbehaves.  Look, he is.  He's a naughty boy.  Kenny and his sandstone-colored suit are blocking  the sandstone.  No, you know what was funny?  He's the reason we stopped when we were walking by.  We're like, dude, that guy's falling asleep on the couch.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah, Kenny.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  He's like, these guys are a lot of fun. 
[03:12:30]  I'm like, clearly, the guy on the couch is sleeping.  Ah, damn.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  You're giving us a bad rep, Ken.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Sam.  Ah!  Ah!  Sam.  Boring you.  All right.  We gotta let her go.  We gotta take leaks.  All right.  All right.  Thanks so much, guys.  Keep in touch, all right?  We'll get married.  Yeah, you keep in touch, okay?  I will.  I want to see that car.  No, you won't.  All right.  You'll forget as soon as that door slams.  Yeah, okay.  Have your car, call my car.  I don't think we've seen this before.  Our cars will call each other's cars.  No, I knew I wasn't doing anything.  You knew, huh?  I knew that wasn't going to work out very well. 
[03:13:00]  She was nice.  Well, she was nice.  She was cute.  Yeah, she came into this fucking place.  She was very nice.  Man, she fucking jabber-jawed with us, bullshitted for a little bit.  What's the matter, E-Rock?  You're making a face.  What happened?  No, her people were a little worried because she almost gave away who it was that she actually liked.  You guys hit one of the names, and they kind of turned and looked at each other in a panic.  Wait, you saw them look at each other?  Yeah.  So when do they look at each other?  What's the name?  What's the name?  I don't remember their names, but when Jim said, oh, is it someone that you work with on your show, 
[03:13:30]  the people just kind of opened their eyes wide and looked at each other like, oh, my God.  Oh, hmm.  Whoever the comment is on the show.  Just more non-news for me.  Oh, damn.  Shut up.  E-Rock just put his hands on Sam as Sam goofed on E-Rock yet again.  What would it matter?  I wouldn't even know versus him.  More non-news, he yells out, and then E-Rock chopped him.  All right, let's do another 20 minutes on wrestling.  Oh!  No, he's being serious.  He just wants to do another 20 minutes on wrestling. 
[03:14:00]  He actually wants to.  Yeah, that was, yeah.  Yeah, you're right, Danny.  He kind of, you know, any Hulk on the door?  They're not that spectacular.  No, no.  I understand the intention there, but you did blow it by saying wrestling, because he's  got sandwiches and I have chicken fingers.  Sorry.  Cold cuts.  Oh, shit, man.  Who cares if they find out?  It would help the show.  It's versus.  If the Islanders aren't on versus, I wouldn't know that channel.  I don't know what they'd do.  Roy Jones lost, huh? 
[03:14:30]  Jimmy?  What's that?  Roy Jones lost.  Oh, I didn't.  God almighty, I did not watch the fight.  Hopkins or Jones.  Yeah.  Roy was in here promoting this fight.  Hopkins kind of blew us off, and Hopkins defeated Roy Jones Jr. 17 years after their 
[03:15:00]  first fight.  Well, he didn't blow us off.  He came in late that day.  He wasn't in town.  He came in.  Oh, I'm sorry then.  I apologize, because we had a good time at Hopkins.  Yeah, it was great.  I don't know anything about the fight.  Was it a knockout, decision?  Anybody know?  No idea?  It was a unanimous decision.  Oh, decision.  Okay.  Eagles trade McNabb to the Redskins.  That's a big little trade for the NFL, huh?  Wow.  Who'd they get?  I don't even know.  A couple draft picks.  Okay.  So what are the Eagles thinking? 
[03:15:30]  They have like three quarterbacks, so.  True.  But what are they thinking, though?  Who's the guy?  Anyone?  That white guy.  Yeah.  It was him and Michael Vick, so.  It wouldn't be Vick?  I don't know.  If it is, he'd have to be the quarterback, because he said he wants to be a quarterback.  He doesn't want to be, you know.  Right.  Obama.  Just waiting for your yuck, so that I can finish my sentence.  I was just going to say, ugh, what?  Obama throwing out the first pitch at the Nationals game today. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, I was going to say, how did he do?  Remember last year?  Wasn't he wearing his mom jeans, and the throw was horrendous?  That was already a year ago?  He's a nerd.  Obama's a nerd.  He really is a nerd.  He's a nerd.  And today is the 100th anniversary of the first presidential pitch.  Who was that guy in?  A hundred years ago?  You know your presidents.  A hundred years ago, the first president throwing out the first pitch.  That would be 1904. 
[03:16:30]  Uh-uh!  Which, or, excuse me, 1910.  Jesus, you're off by six years.  1910.  Which would have been, um, let's see.  Try it, guys.  I'm going to go with Woodrow Wilson.  Nah, he was a little later.  It was 50 years ago that FDR actually went to throw out the first pitch and fell out of  his chair on the pitcher's mound and just laid there. 
[03:17:00]  I'm going to say, um, uh, the other, uh, uh, Roosevelt.  Teddy.  Yeah.  Teddy Roosevelt.  No, he was, he was, like, busy.  He was later.  Wait, we can't figure out who the president was in 1910?  He was busy.  Um, yeah, it's kind of hard to, um, how far could you go back right now?  Shut off everything.  I'm not, I'm not looking.  All right.  Go backwards in presidents.  I want to see how far you could go back.  I could get to, I think I could get to about Kennedy. 
[03:17:30]  Start, start with Obama.  Go ahead.  I want to see how far, how far you could go back.  You got Obama.  Then you got George W.  Okay.  Then you got, uh, Clinton.  Okay.  Then you got the first George.  Mm-hmm.  And then before the, uh, first George, you got the, uh, Ronnie Reagan.  Okay.  And then you got, uh, Jimmy Carter.  Mm-hmm.  And then you got Gerald Ford.  Mm-hmm.  And you got Richard Milhouse Nixon.  I'm still with you.  And then you got, uh, uh, Johnson.  I'm with you still.  And then you got, uh, uh, Kennedy. 
[03:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then you got, uh.  George Washington.  Eisenhower.  I'm still with you.  I could get to Eisenhower.  I think, yeah.  I think that's where I would end.  And then you got, uh, Harry S. Truman.  Oh, Truman I would get.  And then you got, uh, Roosevelt.  Franklin Delano.  Roosevelt.  Mm-hmm.  And then you got, uh, Woody Wilson.  Before Roosevelt, was Woody Wilson?  What were you looking at me for?  How was he now?  I dropped out of high school.  No, we needed on, we needed to Google it.  No, it isn't. 
[03:18:30]  I think that's where I messed up.  Hoover.  Fuck.  I forgot about that.  Fuck.  So how far did you go back to?  I made it to, um.  1933.  That's not bad.  Before Hoover.  I was just saying, when you're ready for the answer, I have it on.  I have it here for you.  Oh.  Well, not here.  If you're ready, I'll give it to you.  Oh.  I think I know who it was, actually.  Mac Tidwell.  It was not President Mac Tidwell.  Was it Turk February? 
[03:19:00]  Turk February.  It was partner Bill Tuttleberry.  I love Turk February.  Turk February is God.  Oh, God.  It was Hoover, Coolidge, Harding, then Wilson.  Yeah.  Oh, you messed up?  And we didn't even know?  No, no.  Like, Wilson was where I fucked up anyway.  Wait, so.  I'm an entry.  So, one of those presents.  I made it all the way back.  Yeah.  It's either Hoover, Coolidge.  I'm going Coolidge.  Yeah!  For the win!  Coolidge FTW?  Coolidge for the win. 
[03:19:30]  Come on.  Well.  Epic fail.  It was William Howard Taft.  Taft?  Taft and that stupid mustache.  What did he have going on?  A mustache or the sideburn?  What did he have going on?  Oh, he had a big fucking walrus-y mustache.  Taft.  Oh.  Any fucking video of that?  First name, Ted.  Look at him.  Ted Taft.  Taft.  Nothing wrong with that mustache.  Taft was, um, not a, not a looker. 
[03:20:00]  Very presidential.  Looks like Wilford Brimley.  He does.  What a douche.  I'm a president and I got diabetes.  I get my medical supplies from Liberty.  Fucking stick in the mud.  I just don't like how he yells at you.  It's just like, I don't have to call Liberty.  I don't have diabetes.  I like this one where he's like, well, you could sit around and feel sorry for yourself.  I hope you don't do that.  Fuck you.  Call Liberty.  It's like, no, do it.  Call Liberty. 
[03:20:30]  Do it right now.  They send you the supplies.  De'Ales, don't interrupt me, motherfucker.  Hobble over there on your six-toed feet.  You're no foretoe having diabetes, motherfucker.  Wish I did a better impersonation of this son of a bitch.  You just got to grumble and be angry.  Diabetes.  Sam, you can sit for a while.  We're doing real sports.  We'll get to the fake sports in a second.  Oh, God.  Sit down, please.  Over there. 
[03:21:00]  So, Obama throws out the first pitch today.  Tiger's doing his fucking press conference thing.  Two o'clock, anyone going to watch?  No one's going to watch that, right?  No.  The whole world's going to watch and get no answers again.  We already got, like, his first interview.  Lakers signed Kobe Bryant to a three-year extension.  Whatever.  I don't know if people care about that.  Red Sox overcome four-run deficit to beat the Yankees 9-7.  Oh, I know what we got.  John Sterling's first two home-run calls of the season. 
[03:21:30]  Now, this is odd because we do have a brand-new Yankee who hit a home-run last night.  Who?  So we don't know.  Oh, Granderson?  Yeah, so we don't know if he's got a little saying made up for him.  What are we going to do?  We should take bets on what the line will be.  For Granderson?  Yeah.  Granderson.  I think I have one.  I didn't hear.  I don't know what it is.  I didn't hear it, but I'll say he says maybe a grand one from Granderson.  I agree.  It's got to be something with the word grand in it. 
[03:22:00]  How grand?  Granderson!  Or some fucking idiocy.  I'm going to go with...  Oh, Granderson of a gun!  Just imagine if he ever hits a grand slam.  A grand slam would be a grand slam with a grand slam!  You know what?  Granderson of a gun, he's done it!  He might be one of those, too.  Yeah, it might be one of those.  Can I go with Grandmifeson?  Grand-nifeson?  You know what?  It might be that.  Oh, Grand-nifeson.  Wait, who's writing these down?  Wow, this is really bad.  You know what's sad, though? 
[03:22:30]  Is that that's not a bad guess.  Mine?  You know?  Travis knows?  No, I don't know, but none of these guesses are good.  He could say anything.  No, no.  Grantacular!  Yeah.  Grand-tastic!  I'm going with...  Ah!  Ah!  I'm saying grand-tastic.  And what he should say is, a home run by Granderson!  Yeah.  That's what he should say.  I got Grand-nifeson.  What do you got, Ed?  What's your official one?  Grand-tastic.  That's just plain off mine!  Yeah, but mine's like, fantastic, grand-tastic.  I'm going to say...  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  He really whacked the cunt lips off of that ball.  All right, let me write that down.  The cunt lips off of that ball.  All right?  Ah, shit.  All right.  Any more guesses?  Coming in?  Nothing?  Well, here's his first home run call of the season for Posada.  So this is Posada.  Horton.  Line deep to right field.  Ferris gone.  It is gone!  It hit the pesky pole.  Georgie, just one.  A bullet line drive right down the right...  He calls it the pesky... 
[03:23:30]  That's what they call it in Boston because it's some stupid pesky guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's when it hits the fucking pole like that, and it's a home run and bounces back in the  field.  Yeah, it's some stupid Boston thing.  Don't even ask me.  Oh, it is an actual Boston thing?  Yeah.  I didn't even know.  It's a stupid Boston.  A bullet line drive right down the right field line.  No argument.  It banged right off the pole.  So Georgie, just one.  He drills the first Yankee home run of the year, and the Yankees take a 1-0 lead.  Not much energy there.  Oh, but I like that call. 
[03:24:00]  Georgie, just one.  It looks like John Sterling is hearing the rumblings.  Ah, because it's a...  Ah!  Georgie, just one.  Maybe as the season goes on.  You know, he's been off for a while.  I like that call until Georgie juiced one.  Why?  Because Georgie juiced one.  Did he?  Yes, he did.  He put a ball and a bunch of apples in a blender and drank it?  He juiced it.  Just stop.  I almost wouldn't mind if it was a special home run that does all that crap, but just regular  home runs as the year goes on. 
[03:24:30]  Just keep it simple, right?  That was the first one of the season.  He should have been a little more up for that one.  All right.  I was a little disappointed hearing that.  Here's Granderson.  So I'm guessing a Grand Mifison.  Ant's thinking Grand-tastic, which he's kind of cheating.  Let's be honest.  Grand-tastic.  And Jimmy's was, he hit the cunt lips.  He really hit the cunt lips off of that ball.  Yeah.  Let's see who's, I'd love for Jimmy to win.  We're all rooting for me to be right, aren't we?  Yes.  Swung on, hit high in the air.  The deep right center.  That ball is high.  It is far. 
[03:25:00]  It is gone.  Over the Boston bullpen.  Into the bleachers.  What a shot.  In his first at bat as a Yankee.  Oh, Curtis, you're something sort of Grand-ish.  He drills our home run into the bleachers, and the Yankees take a two-nubbing lead.  See, mine and Ant's guesses were purposely douchey, and he out-douched us.  He out-douched everything.  Can I please hear that again?  He out-douched our goof fucking call. 
[03:25:30]  Because it didn't even, he's definitely going to have to come up with something else.  What an embarrassment.  In the air, the deep right center.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Over the Boston bullpen.  Into the bleachers.  What a shot.  In his first at bat as a Yankee.  Oh, Curtis, you're something sort of Grand-ish.  He drills our home run into the bleachers, and the Yankees take a two-nubbing lead.  Something sort of Grand-ish.  That would be an epic.  Everything that was said in this studio, including Jimmy's cunt lips, was better than that. 
[03:26:00]  Of course.  Was better than that fucking call.  You're something sort of Grand-ish-ish.  Grand-ish?  That was an epic fail.  Epic fail or just fail?  Epic fail!  They all are.  I'm a fan of the epic fail.  Sort of Grand-ish.  That's fucking horrendous.  And I know you're not a basketball player, but I must be a fan.  Either or.  He lacks melanin, height, and skill.  Yes.  What's his name?  Andrew Bogut? 
[03:26:30]  Bogut?  How do you say his name?  Did you see this guy fucking break his arm?  No.  Did you see this fucking guy break his arm?  Was it?  Yeah.  This highlight was everywhere.  He fell down.  Was it a Theismann-inducing, like, ow, ow?  I honestly, he started falling awkwardly, so he puts his arm behind him to try to block  his fall, but then he was still twisting, so his arm was pretty much completely behind  him when his entire body weight fell on it.  If we can find the video, I don't know what players get for fucking faking their stupid 
[03:27:00]  falls, by the way.  God, do I hate when they fake their falls.  Well, this was more, you know, under the hoop.  They're all up in the air, and now they have to come down.  Nothing worse than the fake foul fall down.  It's like, stop it.  Is this it?  I hope so.  Watch you react.  I mean, listen to the reaction.  Not yet.  No, he hasn't had to because of the other.  All right.  Look at that out.  Here we go, watch.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  God damn it!  I know! 
[03:27:30]  I know!  His arm spun around backwards.  He's screaming.  He's screaming like a girl.  You know, it's just swollen real fast.  You know what?  The players are walking away.  Both teams' players are walking away with that look on their faces.  That look on their faces.  Dude, I can't.  Watch it spin backwards.  This could be worse than the Theismann one.  I'm telling you right now.  Hold on, hold on.  Falls.  Oh!  Ow! 
[03:28:00]  His elbow bent fucking backwards.  He's screaming being let off the court.  I hate to say this, but that's in the Theismann category.  See, everybody says that.  I'm saying worse right off the bat.  Wow.  I'm saying fucking worse.  You must have forgotten the Theismann.  No, I did not.  Pull up the Theismann then.  Oh, I don't want to.  It's so hard to watch.  No.  I can watch that.  I can't watch Joe Theismann.  I'm saying that one is worse.  This just needs a little time. 
[03:28:30]  I'll tell you why Theismann's worse because the leg is a worse bone to break to me than  the arm.  It's a bigger bone.  And that was his elbow that bent backwards.  Yeah.  And it looked like his shoulder popped out, right?  His shoulder was all puffed out, too.  Have you seen that MMA guy who goes to kick the other guy in the shin and it just goes  wobbly?  That's the worst thing I've ever seen as far as a bone break goes.  I've seen worse than that on my favorite website.  I have a tough time watching that stuff, man.  TedBreaksIsArm.com?  Oh, no, no.  I mean, Bloodshows. 
[03:29:00]  It's the worst site ever.  Hard.  Yeah, I finally said it.  I can't watch any of those.  Uh-uh.  Oh, you're punching up Joe Theismann?  Hey, you asked for it.  I'm going to try to watch Theismann.  This is so bad, dude.  I couldn't watch the replay of that clip that we just had.  Let me watch some Theismann.  And Lawrence Taylor slammed Theismann to the ground.  Lawrence Taylor was up, saying Theismann is hurt.  And I don't believe Lawrence Taylor would have reacted that way, but Theismann is really 
[03:29:30]  One for the A's.  Oh, it has to be one of these.  It's an interview behind the break.  Oh, yeah.  Taylor felt bad about it.  More than just the break.  Right away.  Right away.  He was like, get out here.  Oh, God damn.  Football's greatest injury.  Joe Theismann.  Let me see.  Oh, it's so sad.  See, that's not the isolated shot that shows his leg.  No.  The pressure's on it, on it, on it, and then bam. 
[03:30:00]  It just snaps sideways.  Yeah, but that guy's elbow bending away.  Did that end his career?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was it.  That was it for Joe Theismann.  That was the last fight, right?  And fucking LT had a smoke crack to get that out of his mind every day.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, here it is.  He jumps on him and...  Ah, you know what?  That's really bad, obviously.  But the one we just saw, the guy coming down on his own arm.  That's his fucking... 
[03:30:30]  I'm telling you, I'm going to go with the one that just...  LT was freaking out right there.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Theismann's fucking...  It was like his shin bone snapped.  It wasn't the upper leg.  Still.  Oh, it's horrendous.  They're both horrendous.  And they all fell on it?  Look at this.  Watch.  Ah!  Fuck!  It's the energy it snapped with.  I bet he could feel it snap under his weight, too.  And then he's just...  All that weight of Lawrence Taylor and five other guys on your broken fucking... 
[03:31:00]  You think he's still...  Both of those bones in your fucking...  You think he feels that when it's about to rain?  Did he finish the game?  Yeah, right.  I got you.  He throws his leg over his shoulder.  Walk it off, dick.  That makes my balls hurt to watch that.  Like, you get that little...  Yeah, yeah.  The little tingly, whooshy ball feel.  What is it about your balls that have sympathy with other things?  Wait, the basketball player...  My balls feel sympathy for your legs, sir.  The basketball one wasn't as bad? 
[03:31:30]  Oh, no.  It was definitely as bad.  It was pretty fucking...  I just think it's a lot tougher breaking a leg than an arm.  I got the play-by-play without us reacting for the radio audience.  Not yet.  No, he hasn't had to because of the other...  Look at that elbow.  Look at that elbow!  Okay!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Got his wrist.  No, no!  His elbow.  Oh, it's...  It's broken.  Oh, no.  It's broken.  It's broken.  It's puffed out.  Or it's just...  Or it's just...  You know, it's just swollen. 
[03:32:00]  Real fast.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Dude, I can't watch this one.  I nigh.  Which one is this?  The kickboxing one.  Look at his...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He went to step on it.  Like, he didn't even know it was broken.  Yeah.  He goes to step back on it, and hey, there's nothing there.  Can I...  Was that Dwayne Ludwig?  Yeah, the basketball guy?  No.  No, the MMA guy.  Maximum from Idaho, saying?  Or is that another one?  I got to check.  I'm not sure. 
[03:32:30]  Diamond Dallas Page.  Yeah.  His leg break was pretty bad.  Wow.  The worst one I've seen was footage from Iran or something, where I guess somebody had  sinned against Islam or done some other serious crime.  Of course.  Why are you trying to turn us on to this?  They were holding him, and the guy was beating his legs with a bat.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He broke...  The guy's legs were, like, one guy held his leg, and the other guy repeatedly smashed  both of his legs with a bat.  That's good.  He was a hurting Johnny, as they say.  I wonder what he did.  Kissed a woman? 
[03:33:00]  Exactly.  Probably acknowledged a clitoris.  Kyle S. from Indiana writes, that video's not as good as Andrew Bogut high-fiving himself.  That would be the NBA player high-fiving himself.  Arm wrestling breaks are the worst, too.  Those are so hard to watch.  Even that scene in The Fly is hard to watch, because you know it's coming.  Yeah.  All right.  And that's fake.  God damn it.  It's a tough one.  It looks really good, though.  Yeah.  We got a lot of sick fucks out there.  Let's go to...  I don't know.  Let's start from the top here.  Maximum in Idaho. 
[03:33:30]  Maximum...  Was that the MMA one we played here?  Yeah.  No, the one where the dude kicks is Corey Hill, the black guy, and that is fucking gross.  And then there's a new one, Blaine Ludwig.  He gets taken down, and his shinbone almost pops through his fucking skin.  Duh.  Okay.  Oh, I'll have to look at that one.  Yeah, we'll check that out.  Mark in Florida?  Yeah.  Four or five years ago, University of Alabama wide receiver Tyrone Prothro got rolled.  His leg got rolled in the end zone against the Florida Gators. 
[03:34:00]  And the break was pretty gruesome, but the after effect where, like, from his ankle down,  was just flopping was pretty gross.  You have to check it out.  Oh, my God.  Any type of break like that is just horrendous to see.  We got a lot to check out here.  Let's go to Brandon in Chicago.  It freaks us out when we see people bend where they're not supposed to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really does freak people out.  That's why I think it's worse, seeing an elbow bend in that way.  Yeah, but even that, I understand.  It's bending backwards.  It shouldn't.  But it's a place that's supposed to bend, even though it's the other way. 
[03:34:30]  When you get in between where places are supposed to bend, and it bends, that, yeah, a fucking thigh bone.  Yeah.  Brandon in Chicago.  It's gotta look sick.  Yeah.  What's up, boys?  What up, Brandon?  Years ago, there was a WF wrestler, Sid Vicious, big, like, seven-foot-tall blonde guy, and he came off the top rope to drop a leg on someone, and his heel caught the mat and just snapped his leg in half.  Jesus. 
[03:35:00]  All right, we're gonna have to find all these.  Oh, good.  This guy's leg.  Look, he's screaming.  Wow.  Wait, George Foreman.  Still pictures.  You know what?  Oh, boy.  All right.  There it goes.  All right.  Don't look at the phone screen.  Don't look at the phone screen, Ant.  Worst.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Wow.  This is a football player, a guy running into a cart and snapping it on a cart when he went through the end zone.  Worst football, uh, no, not football. 
[03:35:30]  Worst sports injury ever.  Who wants to take a stab at it?  Darryl Stingley.  All right.  That pretty much ends that.  That pretty much ends that.  And I was trying to save the bit by going no and trying to come up with some kind of criteria.  That pretty much ends that fucking little thought.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you right now.  We have to go to break with some kind of Bob Kelly, uh, leg break bit. 
[03:36:00]  If you can find which I was, uh, I was going to go with what Fred, Fred has on the line here.  Worst sports injury ever, but fucking Jimmy beat it.  But go ahead, Fred.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  How about, uh, you're a hockey fan.  How about Nicky getting his throat slit on the ice?  That's it right there.  The throat.  That was so bad.  I would, I would put that right up there, man.  But, uh, I mean.  There's a goalie, too, to get his throat slit.  Well, what would.  And he'd just pour out of him on the ice.  Well, everyone knows he would, he ended up okay, but the.  Holy shit. 
[03:36:30]  Look at these fucking pictures.  I can't.  Look at these.  I know it's radio, but.  Where is this, Danny?  There's a guy kissing.  Looks like a Mars kissing a soccer ball.  Danny, where is this?  If you YouTube, uh, just sports injuries, it's going to be like on the front page.  Yeah, it's a whole montage.  It's a collection of stills.  Yeah.  Of horrific injuries.  Oh, wow.  That's a rough one.  It sucks.  But.  But what makes the ice hockey, uh, throat slit thing so bad, at the time, you thought you  were seeing a guy dying on the ice.  Oh, yeah.  Because the blood was just pouring out.  Slid his throat. 
[03:37:00]  And they said they only had a.  A few minutes to, you know, stop the bleeding or he was going to be dead.  Thank you, Fred.  I appreciate that.  These.  Slow motion fucking.  Oh.  Oh, there goes his leg right there.  Wow.  Look at him.  He's trying to grab it.  Oh.  How are you running and just snap your leg like that from running?  I bet he needs orthotics.  I've hurt my ankle a few times, but not quite to that extent.  Wow.  Is he hurting?  You think he's hurting?  Yeah.  He's just.  Did he just score? 
[03:37:30]  No.  Oh.  His leg just went in two pieces.  Oh, I thought he was excited that he scored.  Yeah, he did look excited.  He was sitting up just shaking his hands.  That was a big World Cup goal right there, no?  It's got to give you good leverage if you could take the pain where you just swing your  leg like a nunchuck and fucking, you really kick that soccer ball.  Matt in Buffalo goes, I know it's radio, but I'm still getting queasy listening to you  guys talk about this stuff.  That means we're doing our job.  Painting the pictures.  You've got to paint the pictures. 
[03:38:00]  All right.  Should we take a break from this?  Yeah.  It's great car action on fucking TV.  Vroom, vroom.  Some guy crossing the street getting hit.  And then they cut it off midway through.  Thank you.  It's great watching people get hit with vehicles misbehaving.  All right.  A quick break.  And oh, yeah, we got to do the man, the fat guy, man, too fat for jail.  Great story today.  We'll do that next.  But first is down your way down. 
[03:38:30]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Water.  Water. 
[03:39:00]  I'm going to squeeze some.  On the side.  I broke my knee, man.  It bent backwards.  Does it hyperextend?  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, my God.  It bent backwards.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it play, dude.  Ah, fuck.  I broke my knee, man. 
[03:39:30]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Ah.  I'm going to squeeze some.  Ah.  Anybody have some, like, ad building?  Ah, motherfucker.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, you motherfucker. 
[03:40:00]  Ah, oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Ah.  Ah, it's fucked up.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, you mother.  Ah.  Ah, what the fuck?  I broke my hand, man.  I got to squeeze some.  One more.  I broke my hand, man.  I got to squeeze some.  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg, man. 
[03:40:30]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
[03:41:00]  I broke my leg, man.  I'm in so much pain, dude.  I'm in so much pain.  I broke my leg, man. 
[03:41:30]  You go, Sam, I bet you the WWE or wrestling in general, the wrestling world in general,  you know, the big wrestlers and stuff, they can't go 100 days without one of those guys dropping.  The young ones.  And who was the last guy?  Well, the last young one, we lost one of the Briscoes, but he was an older man.  It wasn't wrestling related.  The last young guy was Ludwig Borga. 
[03:42:00]  No.  All right, that's fine.  And then we go, look, they can't go 100 days.  Right, that was the...  And we had a wrestler die over the weekend.  And how many days did we go this time without a death?  I looked on the wiki pages, and I think I counted 84 days.  84 days.  You almost made it without a young wrestler dying.  Because Canyon, Chris Canyon, passed away.  Shouldn't you just be a wrestler in general?  Because we all know most of these guys don't go to old age anyway.  Well, I mean, we could do whatever rules you want. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, it's whatever.  It's any wrestler.  Why did this guy die?  It was a pill overdose, and people are saying it may have been suicide.  He had his...  Man, that's suicide.  Did he have his demons?  He had his demons.  The fuck?  We all have a...  His demons was the cock, right?  Well...  That was his demon, was the cock.  Canyon, after he left the WWE, he fairly quickly came out of the closet as an openly gay man.  Yes!  Okay, that's Steve.  Was he caught blowing The Undertaker in the boiler room before a big match? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  A dead man.  I don't think The Undertaker was ever blown by Canyon.  Oh.  Well, it's not gay, because he's dead, so...  Oh.  I don't know.  I didn't know that was a rule.  Yeah.  But his catchphrase was, who's better than Canyon?  And then the crowd was supposed to say, nobody!  Oh, no.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought they would yell that.  Nobody?  Nobody would be the answer.  Well, wouldn't there be a lot of people better than him at this point?  At this point, yeah, I would think so.  Oh, that guy?  Yeah, and he played Mortis at the beginning of his career. 
[03:43:30]  In, like, 1997.  He started as a jobber, and then he had his Mortis gimmick, and then he started doing Canyon.  What job did he have?  No, a jobber refers to one of the preliminary wrestlers that loses for a living.  Like the Brooklyn Brawler?  He would be the quintessential jobber.  Wasn't he more of, like, a trainer?  Like, didn't he work at, like, the WCW power plant, like, training the guys?  Yeah, and then as his career started taking off...  Is that where he blew all his guys?  He didn't blow guys.  He trained them to be professional wrestlers, and he trained the stuntmen in the film Ready to Rumble, starring David Arquette. 
[03:44:00]  Travis wants to know if he was a blowjobber.  Oh, he's not a blowjobber.  And Pizza Guy is saying they can now yell, who's deader than Canyon?  Oh, I did hear that one.  And again, the answer would be nobody.  Right.  At this point, he's the deadest.  Right now, he is the deadest of the dead wrestlers.  Wouldn't he be the least dead, though?  Can't you be deader than him?  I mean, he really... 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  ...killed himself good.  The technicality, I guess.  Chris Benoit is deader than him.  Well, I mean...  Chris Benoit's jaw is so dropped, right?  The whole Benoit family is just there like...  Oh, boy.  Singing opera.  What note would that be?  The skeletons are singing opera.  Do we know what note that would be?  The note of dead.  Oh.  Hey, is it true Vince McMahon told everyone up there in Stanford to unplug their phones for  a few days so he doesn't have to acknowledge that he lost another wrestler at a very young 
[03:45:00]  age?  There is a memo on the WWE website that says, blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah, respects  the memory of Chris Canyon.  He was not affiliated with the organization.  Does Vince McMahon just scratch out the name and add the new name into his press release?  No.  We respectfully acknowledge, and then just a stamped name in there.  And Canyon had been away from the company for many years, and therefore, obviously, this  had nothing to do with the WWE.  It was just Chris Canyon had his demons. 
[03:45:30]  And he played a demon named Mortis, so that's ironic.  Wow, that is.  And now he's got Riga.  Mortis.  Oh.  Oh.  It's a tag team now.  Riga and Mortis will be...  Mortis will be wrestling.  But, I mean, he was successful.  He had a tag team belt.  He had the U.S. title.  He had a thing with Raven, a thing with DDP.  I guess we shouldn't make fun, but the fact is, another young guy dying that used to wrestle  there, Sam.  How old was he?  He was 40. 
[03:46:00]  40.  The 40s is a bad year for a lot of wrestlers.  Oh, that's...  Years.  Because they finally realized they're too old to come back, probably.  I mean, a lot of...  When you're in your 40s, you can't convince yourself that you'll come back.  A lot of guys end up leaving us in their 40s.  In wrestling?  Yeah, that would be the...  I think that's the decade.  Start the clock again.  Let's see if we can go 100.  Let's see if we can go 100 days, Sam.  Come on.  I mean, I wish...  I think we can go 100 without losing another wrestler.  Yeah. 
[03:46:30]  There's a lot of wrestlers.  One less now.  You know, he wanted to actually do the Opie and Anthony show at one point, and you guys  turned him down.  Oh, we did?  Yeah, when he first came out.  I put him over the edge right there.  It was like two years ago.  Imagine that was...  Wait, we didn't take a gay wrestler?  I don't know.  That would have been great to ask gay questions.  Did we know he was gay?  Gay questions.  Yeah, I told you.  He just came out.  He might try to kiss us on the mouth or something.  I don't care.  I think he can kill himself.  We were just scared that he was going to rub up against us. 
[03:47:00]  Because it was...  Jimmy's in shock.  At the time, you don't know.  Maybe we had all this shit going on.  I don't know what the circumstances...  What's more interesting than did you ever get a heart on wrestling?  I don't know what the circumstances were.  Who would you have sex with first?  Rolling around with men?  He was supposed to come out with a book that he never did.  And he said at one indie show or something...  What was the name of his book?  I don't know what his book was called.  What was the name of his book, everyone?  Moby Dick.  That was my first try.  Title's taken.  At one point, he said on an independent wrestling show that he was fired from the WWE 
[03:47:30]  because Vince McMahon found out he was gay.  So I guess he was going to come with those...  Why does that wrestler have a heart on?  At the end, he found a great picture of some college wrestling or maybe even high school.  Who the fuck knows?  But they're in their little wrestling tights and they just got up off the mat.  You could tell this.  One guy has a raging heart on.  The other guy looks like he might.  To the right.  Or is that a fold in his singlet? 
[03:48:00]  That is just so gay.  There was never...  I don't think any moment that Chris Canyon had an erection on television in his tights.  Was he wearing...  You suck, Jimmy.  Okay, that's not what...  That's not Chris Canyon.  Is this a picture of Chris Canyon?  That's not Canyon.  It is, right?  No.  That's the guy who does my massages every week.  John Royce.  I mean, you can...  It's a guy with obvious penis balls in his wrestling trunks.  Well, that sucks, Sam.  We'll try to go 100 days, though. 
[03:48:30]  A lot of boners on these wrestlers.  Again, these are amateur, collegiate, and high school wrestlers.  These are not pro wrestlers.  By the time you're a pro, you learn to jerk off right before the match.  Yeah, yeah.  You get rid of your rod.  Canyon never had an erection during a match that I saw.  I always wonder about that.  People that wrestle for a real sport must get so pissed that they see their sport just being...  Called wrestling.  Called wrestling.  And it's WWE shit.  Like guys that go to the Olympics and shit.  And they're like, I'm a real wrestler.  I've won...  Those guys... 
[03:49:00]  I won the NCAA title.  I won a gold medal.  And then their sport is being shown in this way on TV.  I mean, a bunch of them decide they want to make some money and end up trying to do pro wrestling.  And can't, right?  Even though they're real wrestlers.  There's a couple.  I mean, Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar, obviously.  He's looking at this thing.  Well, we got the name of his book that never came out.  It's Cody in Indiana.  Cody?  Yeah, the name of the gay wrestler's book is Underneath the Mat.  M-A-T-T.  Okay.  See.  Oh, see.  Underneath the mat.  And his name was...  Underneath the mat.  His name was Canyon, not the gay wrestler. 
[03:49:30]  The gay wrestler.  He's deceased, by the way.  Just call him the gay wrestler.  Deceased, if that makes a difference.  The gay wrestler.  He had his demons that he committed suicide, and now you're just referring to him as the gay wrestler.  Tammy found a site where it's just boners.  This is the best website I've ever found.  What is fucking...  It's called awkwardboners.com.  Of course it is.  Awkward boners. 
[03:50:00]  Just people with boners.  And they're very awkward.  Those are some awkward boners.  Oh, we...  I don't want to forget this.  Yeah, go.  Go.  Yeah, Dana White's looking for our help.  He called Steve up.  Our pal Dana.  Yeah.  He's been nominated by the editors of Time Magazine to be in the Time 100.  It's a ranking they do every year over people who influenced U.S. culture the most the previous year.  Dana White, to me, it's a no-brainer that he should be in this. 
[03:50:30]  You've got to go to Time.com.  And if you go to specials on Time.com, there's a navigation bar and it will take you to the 2010 Time 100 poll.  And you could put Dana's influence.  You should vote for Dana.  Because it's only a few days left.  And he was number one on Friday.  But now they're up against Lady Gaga.  And you know what?  It's like, I guess she had some cultural influence.  Some.  But I'm saying, like, what did she do to the culture?  She's had a hell of a year.  She's another pop star.  A hell of a year, exactly. 
[03:51:00]  Dana introduced a fucking new...  Like, a new sport.  Yeah.  Or, you know, people say, hey, it's been here for years!  But, I mean, he's actually getting a sport legitimized.  Taking it from fucking, like, backyards and small little fucking clubs.  And making it a part of mainstream pop culture.  He did a lot more for pop culture than fucking Lady Gaga and her big, delicious, lovely clit.  Giant clitoris.  So, if Lady Gaga's clit is not one of the nominees, just go to Time.com and fucking vote for Dana.  Because he should absolutely be on that list. 
[03:51:30]  It's only good for MMA.  If he gets on that list.  Just her clit.  If it's her clit, then vote away.  If it's only her clit, Dana, I'm sorry.  But if it's not her clit, if it's the whole wasted fucking musical nonsense around it, go with Dana White.  And I'll be on Red Eye tonight if anybody gives a shit.  If you don't, I'm still going to be on.  Of course they give a shit.  I don't know if they do.  Yeah, you're right.  I think they do.  I hope so.  Of course they do.  I think they do.  Hey, we got to do the fat guy story before we get out of here.  Fat guy!  Yes, well, he's from Florida. 
[03:52:00]  And he would occasionally eat Papa John's.  And then he decided to come up here and work for the Opie and Anthony show.  That's E-Rock.  Yes, it is.  Abu.  Sam, sorry about the wrestling thing.  It sucks.  But let's set the clock and see if we go 100 days.  It's a flying fuck.  I mean, people care.  That's the truth.  No one cares.  I do.  Yeah, if people still cared, he wouldn't have killed himself.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I couldn't reach out to Canyon myself.  If he was wrestling in WrestleMania, which was a week or two ago, he wouldn't have killed  himself.  Because he'd be like, holy shit, I'm still happening.  Yeah, but he's... 
[03:52:30]  I mean, that's not anybody's fault.  You know, he just didn't have it anymore.  People weren't interested.  How old is he?  He's 40.  I'm 40, I'm sorry.  He was 40.  Like this segment?  He still is 40.  He's just dead now.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  His age hasn't changed.  Yeah.  He was still born 40 years ago.  He just went bye-bye in the box.  Who the fuck is that animal?  I don't know.  You gotta see the front.  It looked like mankind from the front.  All right, this story.  A morbidly obese Florida man has been found guilty of scamming restaurants out of food, 
[03:53:00]  but he won't be going to jail because he's too fat.  George Jolliker is 5 foot 11 inches tall.  He weighs 600 pounds.  Police say he ordered huge meals and ate most of them before complaining about the food  and then sending that food back.  Police say he would refuse to pay.  The 38-year-old was caught after eating almost $50 worth of beef jerky in a restaurant  before returning the last few pieces.  You see, he said the beef jerky was moldy. 
[03:53:30]  The owner called the police.  Police say he avoided jail because he is so fat and the medical cost of imprisoning  him would be too great.  Just push him on his back and make him serve a sentence like a lamb while his fat feet  kicking.  Tortoise.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, big turtle.  You fat fuck.  Yeah.  Ugh.  So it's a little nothing crime.  Who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  $50 worth of food?  Leave him alone.  Yeah.  They wouldn't put him in jail.  If he murdered somebody, they'd put him in.  You know what? 
[03:54:00]  Obviously.  Who gives a shit about the fat guy?  This guy, he's got some info.  Rudy in Mississippi.  I know we're trying to close up shop for today.  Go ahead, Rudy.  Hey, guys.  I was just listening to Jen Stanger on your show, and I went to Wikipedia.  Has anybody taken a look at the first paragraph?  What did they do?  Well, don't tell us.  Let's read it cold for, I know, because I see what you want to talk about, but hold  on.  Let's read it cold.  Stay in the line.  We got it up here in a second. 
[03:54:30]  Danny will read it for everybody.  Let's see.  Let's see.  The first paragraph, sir?  First paragraph?  Talks about Anthony.  Is it the first paragraph, or is it further down?  Go down.  Go down?  Not you.  All right.  Hold on.  No?  Maybe they fucking cleaned it up.  No, they probably fixed it.  Whoever, yeah.  Somebody fixed it up.  All right.  What did it say? 
[03:55:00]  It said that she was a self-serving cunt, and that she, the last time she was seen, she  was running out of the XM building, screaming about Anthony's hog, saying she hasn't seen  one that long since her daddy.  What?  Why?  But, let me ask you something.  I'm all for fucking with Wikipedia pages.  I know, but...  But why?  She wasn't a cunt.  She was nice.  Well, I thought maybe somebody, and maybe one of the interns, or whatever, threw that  in there, but it was just...  I just went to Google.  One of the interns. 
[03:55:30]  Like, I went to Wikipedia.  It's amazing how dumb listeners are.  It was there.  All right.  She just came in.  She was chatty.  She was fine.  She didn't do anything wrong.  She was all right.  You know, it's like, if you're going to hit with people's Wikipedia pages viciously,  I'm all for that.  But wait till they deserve it.  Yeah, I know.  You know, easy target.  It's a week.  Why?  Because she's fucking her daddy.  I love the show, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  Bye-bye.  I wanted to show that very badly.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out of here. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah. </pre>
