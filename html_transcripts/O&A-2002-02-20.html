<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a highly offensive discussion about a New Orleans broadcast interruption during a segment featuring the recurring, and apparently annoying, character "Frenchie."  Speculation arose regarding station manager Tom's involvement, which he later denied in a phone call.  This was followed by a racially charged and insensitive discussion of the lack of Black athletes in the Winter Olympics, echoing controversial comments made by Jimmy the Greek, provoking numerous listener calls, both agreeing and disagreeing with the hosts' views.  The segment also included prank calls (notably to Miss Cleo), listener reactions to "Whip-A-M-Out Wednesday" and Frenchie's antics, promotion of the "Naughty Nighty" contest on their website, and other vulgar jokes and banter.  Jim Norton was present in the studio, and the hosts mentioned Pharrell's earlier intoxicated appearance on CNN. The segment ended with a morbid story about a dog eating its deceased owner.

The show continued with a listener recounting a triple homicide-suicide in their former residence, transitioning into discussions of the Andrea Yates case and other disturbing true crime stories, including a decomposing body falling through a ceiling, a woman mauled by dogs (with bestiality allegations), and a dead man found in an adult movie booth.  Another dog attack with similar bestiality allegations was discussed.  A subsequent, extremely offensive and vulgar phone call with station manager Tom, filled with homophobic slurs, misogynistic remarks, and threats of violence, was abruptly ended. The hosts then addressed listener complaints on their message board, followed by Opie playing recordings of his young cousins singing, which led to further cruelly ableist jokes.  The segment concluded with "Double LC" offering to participate in the "55-gallon drum challenge" with a headstand.

The "55-gallon drum challenge" segment dominated the next part of the show, focusing on the difficulty in finding female participants and strategies to incentivize them.  Potential contestants, including Becky from Boston (who offered to eat chocolate-covered sheep's eyes and detailed a drug-fueled car crash), Lori (suggesting drinking bong water), Carrie from Philly (offering a pretzel-like contortion), and Megan from Boston (citing flexibility) called in with various bizarre offers.  A significant portion featured a rambling and extremely offensive phone call with Andrew "Dice" Clay, proposing a performance called "Dice on Ice" involving midgets, tapioca, bodily fluids, and numerous racial slurs.  The segment also included updates on Jim Norton's stand-up tour, commentary on Mayor Michael Bloomberg's vacation and handling of 9/11 aftermath, a debate on his proposed cigarette tax, and further discussion of the "55-gallon drum challenge," interspersed with more calls from potential contestants and clips implied to be from adult films.

The final segment began with a discussion about Mayor Bloomberg's perceived lack of immediate response to city needs following a tragedy, contrasting him with Rudy Giuliani's post-9/11 actions.  A heated call from a police officer expressing frustration with perceived lack of support for first responders ended with the hosts using homophobic slurs.  This was followed by Carrie from Columbus, Ohio, performing a pre-recorded "6 o'clock queef" sound effect. Stephanie, a "Naughty Nighty" contestant, thanked listeners for their votes, before a technical difficulty with distorted audio. The hosts then discussed the "Naughty Nighty" contest, commenting on the contestants' appearances and voting patterns.  A call from John from Jamestown, New York discussed cigarette smuggling, followed by Daniela from Amsterdam expressing frustration with other contestants. Her appearance in *Penthouse* and club work were mentioned.  The show ended with a "What did you learn today?" segment featuring crude observations from callers and announcements for upcoming events, including auditions for the "55-gallon drum challenge" and an Incubus concert ticket giveaway.  The segment, like the rest of the show, was replete with offensive language and sexually suggestive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  Let me adjust my tie and type this out.  Are you ribbing us?  Oh, golly, good gravy.  Jeepers, creepers.  Look at me, Pete, how racist! Oh, my God!  Oh, brother.  Don't f*** yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  I need drugs.  Sucks on a daily basis.  White pussy boy suburban humor.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Aren't we supposed to be trying to gain listeners, guys?  No! 
[00:00:30]  Is that a surprise to you?  You dumb root?  Yeah.  You drink hillbilly?  Yeah.  You stupid f***et?  Yeah.  F*** it!  Yeah.  I drink beer until I pass out.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm from the South.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, redneck?  Easy.  Yeah.  My bad.  My bad.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027. 
[00:01:30]  Anywhere else outside of New York, give us a call at 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Well, on this kind of fine Whip-A-M-Out Wednesday here in New York City.  Yeah, not bad.  We've really gotten off the hook as far as the weather goes.  No winter.  We've had a winterless winter here in New York, and I don't mind it.  Once again.  I don't mind it at all.  All right.  WOW will be back in full force in a matter of weeks at this point, Anthony. 
[00:02:00]  Wow.  I saw a WOW sticker on a truck that had nothing to do with this show.  Like, it was purple and green or something.  Big WOW.  It was smacked on the back of a truck.  Do you know what it meant?  I don't even know where he got it.  I'm sure it meant Whip-A-M-Out Wednesday.  It wasn't like anything to do with the truck line.  Oh, he got a sticker made or something.  But made it himself or something.  Yeah, very innovative.  Well, we like seeing the homemade wow.  Wow, right?  Sure we do.  Jim Norton in the Hay-O's?  In the Hay-A-Y-O's? 
[00:02:30]  Not, not.  We got lots to do today.  Yes.  Carl, yeah.  Carl calling from New Orleans.  Carl, what's up?  Oh, and hey, you suck.  All right.  Dude, I got effing wow today, man.  Oh, yeah?  I don't even have a bumper sticker for the station here.  I got it dusted into my van.  You know, I wrote out wow in the dust of the van.  That works.  Going across the causeway, 25-mile bridge, and these two girls, they had to be 38 or 40s. 
[00:03:00]  I'm not lying.  Nothing wrong with that.  There you go.  You guys suck.  Norton is the man, and you guys blow everybody away.  All right.  I'm so glad we got a real effing station now.  In New Orleans.  Peace out.  The whole time.  My bad Tom.  Thanks, fella.  It's actually on the air today, the station?  Well, yeah.  I guess there's some controversy brewing in New Orleans after Tom was on the air yesterday.  Let's go to cab driver Ricky, one of our spies down in New Orleans.  Ricky, what's up, bro?  Yo, what's happening, ONA? 
[00:03:30]  Hey, man.  You tell us, man.  Man, yesterday, man.  I think Tom must have gotten mad because y'all ragged on him because the station, y'all's  show kind of went off a little bit earlier than usual.  It pissed me off.  Yeah.  It's like pulling teeth when Ricky's on the phone.  Yeah.  We want to make him a character this show, and it's just not happening.  Annoying cab.  Every wacky show needs a cab driver.  I understand, man.  Ho, ho.  We're trying. 
[00:04:00]  He's not crazy enough.  Ricky.  I'm not crazy enough.  I'm a fool.  No one would help.  Well, I'll give you that.  The guy's a hardcore fan of our show in New Orleans.  Yeah.  Ricky, why don't you like calls from a land phone?  Maybe that'll help your appearance on our show.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because your cell phone kind of blows.  My cell phone blows?  Yeah.  All right.  Say, Chris, I can use your phone, though.  Hey, I'm from the South.  I'm not even in a cab no more, dude.  But you're on a cell phone.  Vink, hit a bitty. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, wait.  They're going to dump it.  Yeah.  All right.  Ricky, we're going to let you go because the phone stinks.  All right, dude.  Be cool.  All right.  Call us back from, like, a landline if you can, all right?  All right.  Yeah, a lot of people from New Orleans wrote us overnight, Ant.  I guess after Tom and Frenchie went at it, Tom, of course, runs the station we're on  in New Orleans.  Yeah.  After those two went at it, it got pretty heated.  Yes, it did.  Next thing you know, we're off the air.  Did he pull the plug?  That's what I have to assume at this point. 
[00:05:00]  We got enough email from New Orleans that the show definitely went off the air after Tom  was on with Frenchie.  I kind of think of Tom as a guy who can take it.  Has a little bit of a sense of humor, maybe.  I mean, he flipped the off switch.  Oh, boy.  You sure it wasn't just one of the many times the station just goes off the air?  You think he was just so mad he was pounding the counter and his beer spilled into the board?  Or maybe that, or one of the engineers was tapping his foot to the music so hard that 
[00:05:30]  the plug pulled out or a button hit.  My bad.  Well, there you go.  So we got some controversy brewing in New Orleans today.  His bad.  So maybe if Tom's listening, he can give us a call and tell us what happened.  But I don't know.  All we know is after he was on with Frenchie, shortly after that, we were off the air in  New Orleans.  I don't get it.  Off the air.  My bad.  Bob, what's going on?  Yo, I got to give props to Frenchie, man. 
[00:06:00]  Why?  He kicked ass yesterday.  He was awesome.  You stupid faggot.  That's it, yeah.  That's not what a jackass.  You belong in the dump in Staten Island.  He was awesome.  He did a great job.  He just coined it, you bitch.  I don't like the French, but you know what?  He did a great job.  Suck it!  Hey, Suck it!  Suck it!  Good boy, yeah.  Good man. 
[00:06:30]  Very good, Frenchie.  Keep it up, man.  Suck it!  Great radio.  Goodbye.  You drink hillbilly.  You drink hillbilly.  All right.  This guy doesn't even know Frenchie in here.  All right.  The guy thought he was talking.  Frenchie never has to show up again.  We have about 15 clips of him.  Thank God, because he's very annoying in person.  15 clips that we've been having a lot of fun with on the phone.  Yeah, we've been calling all our friends and just playing Frenchie clips.  Frenchie clips over the phone and people get all pissed off. 
[00:07:00]  It just breeds anger the second you hear these things over the phone.  A lot of those friends of ours are listening to the show right now.  You got pranked by a tape recorder.  Yeah, it was a tape.  You know, when you picked up the phone and said hello and heard this.  What's up, redneck?  It wasn't Frenchie.  They thought they were talking to the live Frenchie.  Rick's cutting up all those calls.  We'll get them on the air as soon as he's done.  Why would Frenchie say this to you?  Topsy Tail is better for hair than you.  What?  Topsy Tail is better for hair than you.  My bad. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, my bad.  My bad.  That's classic stuff, man.  Frenchie, what, made 10 calls last night?  There was actually some live Frenchie in the office after the show last night.  Everyone went back to the office.  And Ben, of course, gives his cell phone to Frenchie and starts dialing all of his friends.  And those Frenchies just go off.  And it was the uncensored Frenchie.  So he's using the F word.  Throwing the F bomb around.  What did he call it from?  A Jewish friend of yours? 
[00:08:00]  And just started going, shut up, you kike.  You Jew.  Hey, heave, give me my money, you Jew.  F.  And he's cursing.  It was very funny.  I want to hear those.  Well, we got Tom checking in.  Tom.  Yeah.  Did you turn off the station knowing that?  I would never, I would never, ever do that to you guys.  If you don't think I could, if you don't think I can take one, come on, guys.  I mean, you know that.  You know better than that.  Faggot.  I'm thinking you turned off the station last night after the Frenchie thing knowing that we'd have to call you. 
[00:08:30]  No.  You're on the air.  Yeah.  No, I did not.  I did not.  What happened last night?  I'm getting to the bottom of it right now.  I'm going to try to find out.  I'm not kidding.  Hey, I was selling O&A live spots to some jewelry store.  Yeah.  Okay?  And then I heard from somebody else that they heard me on the radio and that all of a sudden the show had ended like at five minutes till six or something like that.  Do you think hit a beady?  I'm getting to the bottom of it. 
[00:09:00]  Do you think hit a beady?  Hey, Tom, do you have more problems keeping your wife's clothes on?  Or the O.P. and Anthony show on your radio station?  Oh, that's a good one.  Probably the latter.  We're off the air a lot in New Orleans.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  We're just working the kinks out, baby.  That's all.  All right, baby.  Order the wild tickets today.  I'm from the South.  Hey, I'm from the South.  But you're not from France.  Whip your ass in the world with Rhode Island. 
[00:09:30]  I drink B until I pass out.  I drink B until I pass out.  Rhode Island, keep your ass in the world.  I drink B until I pass out.  Hey, I'm from the South.  My bad.  Where'd you find that dude?  At the rat cook-off?  Suck it!  Suck it!  Actually, man.  My bad.  Where'd you find him at the rat cook-off?  Yeah.  Yeah, he cooked the rat for us way back when.  That dude's a piece of work.  Oh, yeah.  I tell you, man.  He's going to piss me off.  I'm going to put my foot so far up his ass, he's going to taste the fluid on my knee. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  All right.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, look.  This time, y'all go to quarter after six today.  I'll make sure it stays on the whole time.  What's up, redneck?  All right.  We appreciate it, Tom.  All right.  Hey, I'm on top of everything down here.  I heard you ordered WOW stickers for New Orleans.  Yes, and I'm on top of everything down here.  He's my hair, fuck boy.  All right.  Bye.  He's my hair, fuck boy.  All right.  Later.  Suck it! 
[00:10:30]  Oh, brother.  Listening to Tom.  So many people just love Frenchie.  Trying to sound sober.  Jason.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, listen, guys.  I got to tell you, man.  This Frenchie thing, the guy, I don't know why everybody's ranting and raving about heat.  I'd rather listen to the retarded.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Now, more to guys on CNN again.  Uh-oh.  Where's bro?  For a week.  It'll be interesting to see what happens.  If it wasn't for us, the Germans would be speaking French.  And tonight, they're going to beat them 7-1 like everybody else has been.  It's wide open. 
[00:11:00]  It's great.  I like the figure skating.  I love Michelle Kwan.  I love the downhole.  I'm just glad that Peek-A-Boo is Suzy Chapstick now.  She's going to make a bunch of money.  I hear she's coming out with an album in the fall.  All right.  Well, we actually do.  I don't know where you ever go from here, but we actually do have Nick, who's in our audience  right now.  Nick, what do you think about Extremes 4?  I think it's perfect to get the younger viewers to watch it because, like, how many people,  like I was saying before.  All right.  That guy's Asian, by the way, who's talking.  And what do they say?  Listen to the way he's talking. 
[00:11:30]  But, um, also, it's something, like I said, it's a good marketing tool, and I'm saying  to get him to watch it, get us into it.  What's up with that?  No, he's got some black in him.  Is there some homie walking around going, oh, are you like a beef-a-brockery?  Look at the nose.  It's got some little black.  Amerasian, would you say?  All right.  I'd be looking for Al.  Ah, I'm dressed in my window air.  Look at...  You want to see people...  I want to get Pharrell back on here.  Ah, I'm dressed in winter clothes.  Our morning guy snotted on CNN again.  I love it.  Isn't that funny?  On CNN.  And you know he's drunk off his ass.  Oh, yeah.  We know what he does after the... 
[00:12:00]  Oh, he's on again.  Ah.  That's what I'm saying, right?  That's what I'm trying to see.  Tree skiing.  Head first.  Head first.  How can you get hurt with your legs going first?  I'm trying to go head first.  What do you think you're bringing the snowmobiles next?  And have bodies flying off snowmobiles and kids hitting trees and dying?  Are these snow skiing in the trees with necking?  All right.  Just one...  I get it.  What do they get out next?  Making out in the trees up on the mountains?  That'll be great.  Come here, baby.  We might win a gold.  And then we'll have Wayne Gretzky complain and maybe we'll get gold just like the Russians. 
[00:12:30]  Radical.  All right.  Just one minute.  We have Tammy on the fight in New York.  Oh, my God.  Good morning, guys.  That's tough on CNN.  He's losing his mind drunk on CNN.  And they don't know how to handle him.  How awkward is that when she's like, okay, all right.  Don't talk about children dying on snowmobiles hitting trees.  The crowd doesn't even know how to react.  No, they're horrified.  They are horrified.  Oh, God.  Is he out of his mind?  The guy's the real deal.  Love him or hate him, the guy is the real deal. 
[00:13:00]  He's hammered on CNN right now, making a spectacle of himself.  That's why we love him.  That's funny.  Check him out.  He does mornings here in New York.  Yeah.  Did Pharrell say the Germans would be speaking French?  What?  Is he an idiot?  I know he's been jamming the Red Bull in the back, huh?  And a couple shots of the Jameson, you know?  Right.  Oh, he's back.  Pretty general.  Oh, man.  Yeah, they're going to the commercial. 
[00:13:30]  He says in the background, going, ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  There you go.  A little backwards there, Pharrell.  There you go.  Did you watch the Olympics last night, Anthony?  I watched a bit of the Olympics, yes.  I watched Michelle Kwan.  I wanted to see her fall.  Gotta love my sports curse, huh?  She did not fall.  She had a perfect routine.  She did very well.  She's sitting in first place after the short routine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that was cool. 
[00:14:00]  And history.  History made last night, Opie.  Oh, yeah?  As if we weren't reminded eight billion times during the broadcast.  Yeah, history in the women's bobsled.  Competition.  It's the first year of the women's bobsled.  And they won.  The Americans won the gold medal.  It was the second team, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because we talked about the first team.  The first team was on Jay Leno.  Uh-huh.  With the big...  The steroid monster chick.  Yeah.  Big steroid pumped up chick. 
[00:14:30]  They were the ones that were supposed to win the gold, but they failed.  And the second team ends up winning the gold medal.  They win, and here it was.  It was the first African-American medal ever in the Winter Olympics.  And I'm just thinking it's because this is the first African-American in the Winter Olympics.  To tell you the truth, it isn't really a black event.  Summer Olympics?  You would...  Loaded with black.  You would think by now an African-American would have won a medal in the Olympics, the Winter Olympics.  What sports are they entering in? 
[00:15:00]  They've got a couple guys that play hockey.  Not really.  No.  Not really.  Let's be real here.  Let's be real.  Bob Sletting, by the way, the most...  I was going to say it, but don't say it.  I said just let's be real.  Let's call it like we see it.  What?  Are you trying to say, like, black people can't ski and stuff?  What?  No, I'm saying that it's...  Winter sports aren't traditionally...  There aren't many blacks in it. 
[00:15:30]  Earl, please step up to the microphone.  Earl?  Yes, Anthony the Greek.  You have...  Anthony the Greek.  You have not been watching the Winter Olympics, right?  Not at all.  Because there aren't many brothers in it.  No, I'm just not interested in the Olympics.  Well, because...  Do you watch the Summer Olympics?  No.  Oh, you don't watch that either?  You weren't rooting on the sister last night when she was doing the bobsledding?  I had no idea.  Bobsledding, the stupidest sport for the second person, by the way.  All they do is push as hard as they can, jump in, and put their head down.  Yep.  And that's it.  They're done. 
[00:16:00]  If I may sound like Jimmy the Greek for a second, here's an event, this bobsledding,  where the black chick was pushing.  She was pushing.  Pushing hard, too.  The push is the most important part of that bobsled.  If you get a good push, the person's just got to steer it straight.  And Earl, how outraged are you that the black girl had to sit in the back of the bobsled?  Oh, my God. 
[00:16:30]  I was outraged, and I'm not even black.  Making her sit in the back of the bobsled like that.  On the whole, you'd think they would have thrown her a bone and give her the front seat.  On the whole, as far as...  Making her go down the blacks-only track.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:17:00]  All right, sorry.  I was just surprised that she had to sit in the back on the bobsled.  Earl, would you say as far as running and jumping sports that blacks excel, that they do better than whites do in these sports?  That's why in the Summer Olympics, the track, the broad jump...  Marathon.  Marathon.  The...  What do they call those?  The hurdles.  These are traditionally won by black athletes, right? 
[00:17:30]  The javelin.  I didn't say it.  You were thinking it, though.  No.  I don't think the black guys win the javelin.  No.  Did I?  No.  The javelin.  No?  Not really.  Really?  Uh-uh.  Okay.  Well, would you say that that's true about the running, jumping sports?  Spear checker.  No, it's javelin throwing.  Would you say that?  Yeah, pretty much.  I would, too. 
[00:18:00]  So why in God's name did it take until 2002 to get a black person pushing that goddamn bobsled?  As Jimmy the Greek said, using them big thigh muscles that were from the breeding back in the slave days.  See, what the slave owner would do is breed the big black male with the big black female so as he'd get better farm workers.  Is this thing on?  Uh-oh.  That was the last we heard of Jimmy the Greek. 
[00:18:30]  But why would it take so long?  No idea.  I think there'd been maybe a little racism going on in the winter sport.  Yeah.  Whitey trying to keep it to himself.  Keeping the brother down, Earl.  But now, forget it.  You're going to be seeing, you know, I just busted the door wide open.  Now you're going to be seeing, yo, B, I was flying around that band on my skis.  What about speed skating?  Speed skating, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  It's going to bust it wide open. 
[00:19:00]  Next Winter Olympics, mark my words, you're going to see a lot more black athletes.  As Jimmy the Greek said, athlete.  Athlete.  The black athlete is superior.  At least they could keep the coaching for the white people.  Is this on?  Were you taping it?  I'll have another drink.  That's what he said.  It was great.  He didn't really say, is this on, did he?  No, no, he should have.  He just, the camera guy is just going, oh my God, I'm seeing the last of Jimmy the Greek.  Wasn't he kind of drunk at a function? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, he was hammered.  At a function or something?  And they got in his face and it was, it all started, it all started the interview about  black coaches.  Yeah.  And how he feels about it.  And he's like, oh, they're taking over to coaching.  You know, they already took over to sporting events with their big black thighs and their,  you know, their thigh muscles are up a little higher than the white person's.  And he's giving like this frigging, you know, anatomy lesson of blacks.  Woo!  Goodbye, Jimmy.  Happy black history, Mark.  I think you're going to see, you know, I was tearing it up on a half pipe, B. 
[00:20:00]  Snowboarding.  Black people snowboarding.  Extreme sports.  Extreme sports.  Just like Tiger on the golf courses, you're going to be seeing a bunch of the black people  on the ski resorts now.  Right?  Right, Earl.  God bless you.  We have finally, we have finally overcome.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you.  Matt wants to say something, Earl.  Matt, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I just wanted to see if Earl was proud of one of his sisters getting a little Olympic bling bling. 
[00:20:30]  You guys suck.  See you later.  Bert from Randolph.  Jimmy the Greek did sound like Andy Sipowicz.  That's why.  He sounded like that.  Bling bling.  And a little older.  And a little older.  It's Rudy from Survivor.  They ought to take them.  You know, as long as there ain't no faggots.  None of them queers in the bobsled.  I said, I don't care who crosses the line first.  I think we ought to shoot all the faggots. 
[00:21:00]  Is this him?  Rudy would pretty much say if you do the two-man luge, you're a faggot.  Oh, you're a faggot.  Laying on another guy like that.  You ever see two guys jump together like that?  Going down a hill.  How does one stay on?  I'll tell you.  His C and his A.  That's how they stay mated.  I don't care.  I was in NAMM two times.  Who's going to criticize me in his day and age?  All right.  Why don't we take our first break, huh?  First break.  We did a lot that first break, right? 
[00:21:30]  Sure.  I don't know what it was, but we did a little something-something there.  Maybe you'll...  The 90-90 contest, Anthony.  No break.  Continues.  Yeah.  We've got 20 girls.  Go to opandanthony.com.  You can vote every day for your fave.  Yeah.  A lot of people still don't know who they want to vote for, so they're voting for different girls.  Don't be a queer.  Vote for the girls.  Don't be a faggot like that rich.  Should we announce who's in last place? 
[00:22:00]  No.  Them people might pump it up.  We can't.  Can't say a word?  I don't think we should.  I don't think we should let anything out.  Nothing.  Decide for yourself, man.  You don't got to be a brain surgeon.  I think everyone could pretty much...  I think people could probably figure out the top ten.  Top ten?  Yeah.  It's kind of easy.  I bet you they can't even figure out the top five.  You don't think so?  Nope.  Yeah, there were a couple of surprises in there.  A couple of surprises in the top five so far.  Sorry.  You've got to vote every day. 
[00:22:30]  We're down at 20 girls in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Go to opandanthony.com to vote.  Okay?  We've got that great trip to Hedonism 3 for the winner.  Right.  A quick break, and we'll continue.  The phones have exploded, so we'll talk to you guys next.  Hey, this is Rudy Bosch from Survivor One, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I think there are a couple of queers maybe looking for a guy named Richard.  And he...  Boobestank.  Crawling in the dark.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oi.  Kevin wants in on our Winter Olympics discussion, Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  Ah.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you know, it's a simple fact.  Yeah.  You know, black people, we're scared of the cold.  That's why you haven't seen a lot of black people at the Winter Olympics.  Really?  That's right.  You're a black guy, and you're saying that blacks hate the cold, and that's why they're  not in the...  That's a fact.  In the Winter Olympics.  When you go to these football games, when you look at these football games on TV, and  it's below zero in Buffalo, I mean, who do you see in the stadium with their shirts 
[00:23:30]  off?  Ah, Whitey.  There you go.  Well, why do you ever see a black person do that?  Well, we're the crazy ones.  Whitey's crazy.  We all know that.  Look, if...  You do all the crazy crimes, you know?  Look, if y'all want the Winter Olympics, y'all can have the Winter Olympics.  It's like the most boring Olympics ever.  Oh, come on.  Man, come on.  They invent sports in the Winter Olympics.  I'll give you that.  The luge.  What the hell is that?  Extreme.  I mean, come on.  I couldn't take pride in myself if I won a Winter Olympics, because I pushed something  really fast at the beginning of a race, and then I just laid down. 
[00:24:00]  Exactly.  I didn't even know there was any black people in there who went to the Olympics.  After that, you've got to kind of, what, make sure you're keeping a straight line?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  You kind of steer it with your legs.  And this bobsled thing, the two-man bobsled, in the old days, a few Olympics back, the two  people, they both have their heads above the bobsled.  But someone finally figured out that if one ducks down, you go a little faster.  Less wind resistance.  So that second person just pushes real hard, jumps in the bobsled, and then you don't even 
[00:24:30]  see them for the rest of the race.  No, they look down at the floor of the bobsled.  And they trained for four years for this, right?  Yeah.  Four years.  Four years to run really fast for, what, 25 yards?  Yeah.  Yeah, and they get a gold medal, too.  And to jump in nice, and that's it.  Jump in.  Yeah, didn't Herschel Walker, some football players, try this?  Yeah, Herschel Walker.  Herschel Walker was a bobsledder, yes.  Didn't do very well.  There you go.  I don't think it's just because we have these high thighs, like Jimmy the Greek said.  I don't know what exactly it is. 
[00:25:00]  I don't see the best of that sport.  I'd rather watch the snowboarders in the luge, the bobsledding, the aerial thing.  Yeah, I don't like that whole freestyle jump thing that they do.  They go up on this big snow ramp, fly up in the air, and then got to spin and do tumbles  and then land on the skis.  You know what?  Kevin's right.  The Olympics blow.  What about curling?  You win a medal because you sweep the best.  I don't even know how curling works.  My mom should have gotten 20 gold medals by now. 
[00:25:30]  She's a good sweeper.  The vacuum cleaner on the ice.  Right.  But you know something?  Now they changed it around.  Now there's this sport.  I don't know exactly what it is.  The luge, but instead of being like in the back, now you're in the front.  Oh, that's pretty scary, though.  It is head first luge.  It's like jumping on your little sled as a kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Going down head first is pretty freaky, I think.  Well, you know what?  I just think, you know, white people could have the Winter Olympics.  Let the black people have the Summer Olympics. 
[00:26:00]  Let's just come to all to an agreement or something.  There you go.  Okay.  We'll agree with that.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Kevin.  You suck.  Later.  Are they going to have the chauffeur shooting competition?  Because that, I think, is quickly turning into a black sport.  Chauffeur shooting.  Thank you, Ben.  You finally heard it.  I got it.  Hey.  I almost blew it, Norton.  Were you getting nervous?  Yeah, I was, too.  You're a cat looking at a mouthful.  Polo ponies. 
[00:26:30]  Polo ponies.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Yeah.  How did you get the audio from CNN?  Oh, I ran tape on it, dude.  Oh, you were running tape on CNN?  Yeah.  You knew he was going to be on today?  No.  As soon as we got the email, I ran to the other room and hooked it up to the computer, and boom.  So we got, like, the last two and a half minutes with Pharrell on.  We kind of played it on the air already.  Oh, you did?  All of it?  Yeah.  Yeah, we pretty much got it all.  What the hell's that?  Rick is saying it's really funny.  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  Did you guys hear the Susie Chapstick line? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So you had that all.  Yeah, we got it all.  You got it all.  Thank you.  Rick's running around.  He didn't know we played it already.  Yeah, no.  We saw Scott Pharrell.  We just potted it up.  The morning guy here in New York just going absolutely nuts, looking very hammered.  How are you?  All right.  Let's go to Doug from Springfield.  What's up, Doug?  What's up, guys?  You know, you have your own gold medalist in the place.  Huh?  Earl won a gold medal in the picture-hanging Olympics.  I'm sorry, Earl.  I was getting along with you so well, but I couldn't let that go by. 
[00:27:30]  And you know, the blacks have won other gold Olympics before gold medals, snow-stealing.  Oh, stop it, Doug.  That's racist, Doug.  I'm sorry.  We don't do that type of thing on our show.  You stupid faggot.  Uh, please.  I'll pay any amount of money just to box him for three rounds.  I'll give a hundred bucks to a charity.  Please.  I suck it.  Please.  I suck it.  Please.  I think out of everyone, Doug is, uh, the most...  I would just want to snap him in half.  You're the most annoyed at Frenchy, aren't you, Doug?  Because I hate punks.  I hate people who hide behind microphones. 
[00:28:00]  She's my hair, fat boy.  Toxitel is better for hair than you.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Because I'm getting pissed off.  You belong in the dump in Staten Island.  Whatever you want to fight, he has an open invitation.  You dumb, Rube.  A hundred dollars to a charity.  You dumb, Rube.  I don't think Frenchy's hiding behind his mic, is he?  He's a pussy.  A pussy.  Hey there, guys.  All right.  Hey, I'm from the South.  You think he's hiding?  No. 
[00:28:30]  No, I don't think so.  Is he hiding?  He's right here.  Everyone knows where he is when, uh, he's here.  Another black guy checking in about the Winter Olympics.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, um, you know, first of all, she's got to be the smartest black person alive,  because all she did was took a track sport during the summer and decided to jump over  into the snow Olympics.  Black people, we're not afraid of the cold.  We just hadn't found a way to run on snow yet.  Is that it?  That's all it was. 
[00:29:00]  She figured it out.  She ran real hard, jumped in the back of that pop slide.  Because he was a long jumper before all of that went down.  And they said, hey, hey, push on this.  Yeah.  And you'll win a gold.  I don't understand why there's no, there's not, uh, more, uh, black athletes in the Winter  Olympics.  Yes.  All right, boys, you suck.  You would think, uh, Norway would give us a couple.  Nervy.  Norway.  All right.  Some of those guys are great.  Well, I come down the mountain and I was going very fast. 
[00:29:30]  What the hell is this guy talking about?  Who just took my coffee?  Someone.  Why are you moving my coffee?  Now there's trouble.  What are you doing with my water?  Uh-oh.  Hey, Clint, what's up?  Hey, O&A, what's up, man?  You tell us, man.  I want to know what the hell's up with curling.  We just talked about that.  It's about, it's about sweeping the ice.  What is it?  You can be a fed slob and throw this thing down the ice.  I don't know how it works.  It's shuffleboard.  You know, when I had that discussion about snowboarding, I was kind of digging the snowboarding 
[00:30:00]  in the Olympics and you were like, eh, what about curling?  I don't think you need to go to a gym.  Do those people with sweep the ice get medals or what?  And curl?  I don't, I don't think you need to go to a gym to, to get your sweeping muscles in order.  What's the sweeping part of the curling, though?  You haven't checked out curling yet?  Yeah, but I don't know what they do with the sweeping.  It's shuffleboard on ice and they're sweeping the ice shavings off the ice to make it go faster  or slower.  And if you need to slow down the, what do they call the thing?  The rock?  The big slidey thing.  What do they call it? 
[00:30:30]  There's a name for that.  I have no idea.  There's a technique where you could like sweep ice shavings in front of it to slow it down  a little bit.  Oh, is that how it works?  So you're either sweeping to make it go faster or sweeping to make it go slower.  Ah.  I didn't know that.  By fractions of a second.  But it's enough where it gets a little closer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is the dumbest sport I've ever heard.  That's right.  I agree.  That is the stupidest sport.  That and the shooting and the cross country skiing at the same time.  That's not fun to watch, but it is kind of cool whenever guns are involved. 
[00:31:00]  Yes, thank you.  Thank you.  Stinky is a curling aficionado.  How do you know about curling?  It's the best one besides ice hockey on, you know.  They use a...  It's not curling.  You've got it confused.  It's not...  It doesn't mean rolling a joint.  Oh, don't forget it then.  No, I think he's...  You like watching curling?  You watch curling?  Yeah.  It's like bocce all night, you know.  It's exciting.  All right.  But they sweep because when they...  They'll throw it out and they'll spin it.  Yeah.  And when they want it to curve, they'll stop sweeping so the ice catches it and it turns, 
[00:31:30]  but they'll sweep in front of it so it doesn't curve at first.  Translation?  Boring.  That's what they do with.  You stupid faggot.  And they'll sit there and watch curling.  Yeah, it's fun.  A lot of people do.  Look at it.  It's carving.  It's carving.  Wow.  I would rather, and I know I'm going to catch crap for this, I'd rather watch the figure skating.  But it's like a strategy.  Curling blows.  It all blows. 
[00:32:00]  They should do prostate cancer surgery on ice.  It's horrendous.  All of it.  Oh, God.  Curling.  Yeah, okay.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, Pete, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  What's this, ONA?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just want to talk to you guys about, you guys said the freestyle jumpers, right?  Yeah.  That it really sucked.  You know what the best part was?  Did you see when a girl fell flat on her face?  Yeah, that was pretty sick when they crashed.  Yeah, it's excellent, man.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  She went right on her face.  That was good.  I saw that.  You know, I'm trying to get into the Olympics.  I love the downhill, the Super G, I think they call it, which is downhill with, what,  little turns going on?  Well, I got an idea for the downhill.  What?  A full contact while everyone's tanked.  All right.  Thanks, Pete.  That's Chinese downhill.  Let's go to Philly and talk to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Nothing much, man. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  I had a hard time getting through your call picker upper, people.  Yeah.  Yeah, they pretty much suck.  But, no, my point with curling, there's a technique to it.  Well, that's probably why you had a tough time getting through to our show.  Now, I said I was a curler.  I'm not no faggot.  I don't do curling.  What I wanted to say was I was surrounded by spear chuckers when you were talking about  black people not being a little bit.  Oh, stop it.  See, that's why you have a tough time getting through to our show, you idiot.  I just think he does a perfect job. 
[00:33:30]  Jackass.  Oh, my God.  John, what's going on?  Johnny.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  Good.  You know, I'm up here outside of Boston, and I noticed Norton is coming to the Boston  area.  Sold-out show at Avalon, I think.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, well, no, it's not really sold-out.  You can get tickets if you want to.  It's sold-out, idiot.  Oh, okay.  You know better than we.  It doesn't mention anything about the antics and songs. 
[00:34:00]  Are you going to get that as part of the show, or are you going to get the whole vaudeville  bit?  I was just curious.  Two in a row.  Two in a row.  Anthony, a lot of people want to hear the Miss Cleo prank call from yesterday.  We love the Miss Cleo calls.  We're going to regroup.  My God.  There's something in the air today.  Yeah, this is the Miss Cleo prank call, and we'll be back.  Okay?  Check this out.  Hello?  Hello.  How are you today?  Fine.  Can I get your first name and your birth date, please? 
[00:34:30]  No.  Who's calling?  I'm Cleo.  Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?  No.  I don't know who you are or why you're out there.  I'm Miss Cleo.  You're a Libra, aren't you, darling?  No.  Yeah.  I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people, outside  influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?  Who told you to call?  Cleo. 
[00:35:00]  I know, but why are you calling me?  I want you to really remember the pill, all right?  Remember what?  I want you to really remember the pill, all right?  But isn't this costing a lot of money?  Yeah.  I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.  You're way off track.  Oh, my goodness.  Is there a gentleman in your life? 
[00:35:30]  No.  Is he incarcerated?  No.  Did he used to play football when he was in high school?  No.  Yeah, that's the daddy.  You have a good life now.  You have the wrong person.  Pardon me?  You have the wrong person.  Well, I know this doesn't make sense, but you know that things always happen for a reason.  Don't you agree?  I know, but this costs a fortune, this phone call.  Who is paid for this?  You're a Libra, aren't you, darling?  No.  Yep.  No, I'm not. 
[00:36:00]  Yep.  Uh-uh.  Yep.  Nope.  Yep.  Nope.  Yep.  Nope.  Yeah.  I love you.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  He's fighting.  Put more in there.  Put more in there.  Christy is being, uh...  Christy's fighting now, which means more.  More.  Oh, my God.  The tank is coming apart.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show.

[00:37:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  We're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The camera crew has left the studio.  The camera crew has left the studio.  Back to the show.  Back to normal programming. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, someone was asking me who was in last place in the Naughty 90 contest on the instant feedback.  I have to answer.  There you go, Dad.  Can I say one thing about the Naughty 90 voting, Anthony?  Yeah.  That is going on.  You've got to vote every day.  Go to opianthony.com.  Sacramento is not leading the contest. 
[00:38:30]  After the first day of voting.  Wow.  And I have a theory.  But maybe I should, uh...  Well, if I say the theory, will it affect the voting?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, no one can organize that much.  I think they effed themselves.  You think?  They threw so many hot girls into this contest that the reality is a lot of people, you know, rooting for their hometown girl.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Even though we're hoping that people will just vote for the hottest girl.  Mm-hmm.  And there are so many hot girls from Sacramento, they can't get together and figure out who the hottest girl is.  So they're divvying up the votes between three or four girls.  And it is effing them up.  I think so.  You think they put in too many hot chicks?  So now they're spreading their votes out.  Just a theory on it.  Ah.  Is this some...  The old Ralph Nader theory as to why, uh...  There's some, uh...  Ford didn't win the election.  There's some definite surprises. 
[00:39:30]  That's all I'm going to say.  Nader took the votes away.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ah, the Perot, right?  The old Perot.  The old...  Pulling the old Perot.  They thought they were pulling one over on us.  Let me explain something.  And their, uh...  Their, uh...  Their philosophy here, or whatever, their strategy, uh...  Is backfiring at this point.  Ah.  It's a...  That's only after one day of voting.  Yeah, we'll see what happens.  But it's very interesting.  Yeah.  Stephanie wants in on the virginity contest.  Rage from Yonkers.  Hey, what happened to the, uh...  The fat chick you had for that? 
[00:40:00]  Hmm?  What?  The virginity thing.  Oh, yeah.  The sister.  She, uh...  Backed out.  Keisha.  Why?  Because Greg didn't want to bang her anymore because, uh...  They didn't want to ruin their friendship.  Eugh.  What the hell is that?  So, uh...  Blech.  We got nowhere with the virginity thing.  Blech.  Stephanie, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to know about the virginity contest that was gone.  Yeah.  Yeah, how old are you?  Are you a virgin?  Uh, yeah.  How old are you?  Um, what are you doing this contest going for?  What?  How old do you have to be done for this contest?  Well, how old are you? 
[00:40:30]  Uh, 14.  Bye-bye.  Um, I think you're a little quick on the old button there, Opie.  Yeah, Opie.  Why do you want to go and hit that button so quickly for?  Well...  14 and she wants to listen.  Yeah, you're too old.  Someone's got a show responsibility around here.  Responsibility?  Come on.  Well, uh, to answer her question, I think...  Wait, wait.  Let, uh, Norton get the thoughts out of his head first.  We'll just wait a minute here.  I think you have to be, uh, in New York?  17, maybe? 
[00:41:00]  I think 18 to play it safe, man.  I don't know.  18?  I've heard 17, but I always say 18.  You never know.  Some states are 17, some are 18.  You don't know.  Some are 14.  Could have gotten away with her if we were down in New Orleans.  Yeah, I think you better...  West Virginia.  Working on syndication.  All right, I got a, uh...  My bad!  I got a, uh, sucks to be you story, Ant.  Sucks to be you.  We haven't had an unlucky lottery in quite a while.  Well, I got a sucks to be you today, and, uh...  And this lady lived in, uh, good old Huntington.  Huntington? 
[00:41:30]  Our hometown?  Our hometown.  I want to know what part of Huntington.  Someone's got to help me out with this.  Huntington Station.  Is it Huntington Station?  I'm sure it is.  What kind of dog was it?  Uh, no.  She was an older lady and, uh, with a cute little dog.  Really?  And she was at a pet store, uh...  What happened to the dog?  There we go.  I don't understand what could have happened with an older lady and a dog.  No, because she used to go to this pet store across the street from where she lived almost 
[00:42:00]  every day to get the dog, uh, clothes and stuff.  She was an amazing lady.  She was one of those ladies.  She was really...  Well, that's adorable.  She was really into her dog.  We see this.  It doesn't matter where you live.  The older people with the pet dog replacing, uh, maybe a loved one or something.  They're replacing Edgecat.  And then, and then they die anyway, too.  So, you know, they're a little lonely, and they find love with their pet.  You see them around Manhattan all the time carrying their little, their little, uh, baggie  to pick up their little mutant white little poodles trap up with, with their facelift pulled 
[00:42:30]  all the way back.  Maybe the old broads that walk around here, they look like the visible woman.  You ever see that model of the, it's clear, and you see every vein and everything?  Oh, how many facelifts you got?  What are you, what the hell you think it's good?  They got that cotton candy red hair.  Ugh.  You see scalp right through it?  There's like 20 strands.  It's all puffed up.  It's all puffed up.  I went to the parlor today.  Because I am one gorgeous chick. 
[00:43:00]  You were going to charge me?  Let me tell you, they shaved their eyebrows off and put on those clown eyebrows with the  pencil.  Big, high, archy McDonald's arches over their eyes.  Hey, that was the style in the early 60s, Ant.  Please.  And then they carry around these, these little puny dogs, and they do anything for them.  Well, listen to what happened to one of these, uh, dogs and one of these old ladies.  Great.  Uh, very lonely lady.  She had her, her, her, her pet dog, and we'll go across the street to the, the pet store 
[00:43:30]  and get the cute little outfits and whatever the dog clothing, because you know, the dogs  just love being in clothes.  You ready for this?  Just like the Lord intended.  Are you ready for this?  What happened?  Just when you think the dog loves you back.  Yeah.  I'm sure the dog was doing like, she'd go, give me kisses.  Give me kisses.  Give mommy kisses.  I put the peanut butter on, now give me kisses.  Surprise!  Are you ready for this?  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Dog fed on corpse of its elderly owner.  Just when you thought the dog loves you back.  Yeah.  You are just a meal.  So she drops dead. 
[00:44:30]  She drops dead.  And, uh, you know, the dog was hungry.  Hey, a dog gotta eat.  A dog gotta eat, too.  And his name was Rascal.  A little, a little rascal.  The dog Rascal.  All right, let me read you this.  Come here, Rascal.  He's just a little rascal eating your face.  Hey, that's my hood, Rascal.  Don't eat that.  The reality is you're just a meal.  It's just meat.  In the animal kingdom.  Dog fed on corpse of its elderly owner.  The partially dismembered body of a 79-year-old Long Island woman was found yesterday beside the remains of her dog. 
[00:45:00]  The dog died, too?  I think the dog was sick of eating the old, old flesh.  Oh, no.  He said, you know what?  I'd rather die than keep eating it.  No, stop it.  Now, you know what?  All the family's going, the dog died of heartbreak.  The dog was heartbroken that he decided.  No, no.  But this dog had a few meals before he decided he didn't want to eat the old lady anymore.  The partially dismembered body of a 79-year-old Long Island woman was found yesterday beside the remains of her dog,  who apparently fed on his mistress's corpse, cops said. 
[00:45:30]  Until it went rancid, I bet.  That could be it.  If it went rancid, the dog's not going to eat it if it's all rancid.  All right.  A telephone company worker on a neighboring roof spotted Matilda.  Ooh.  Matilda.  That's a hot name.  Come here, Matilda.  Yeah.  23 Skidoo.  Look at Matilda.  Hubba hubba.  She's hot.  This worker spotted Matilda lying on her back porch in Huntington and body parts strewn in the yard. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, the dog was taking him outside.  There's your loving dog that you bought all the outfits for, just ripping your body apart.  Police said Matilda, a widow who lived alone, probably died of natural causes about three weeks ago.  They found the corpse of her four-year-old Scottish terrier.  Oh, Scotty.  Little Scotty.  Police said the dog, Rascal, fed on Matilda's body.  It was unclear when the dog died. 
[00:46:30]  Nice to know people cared about her.  Three weeks and nobody noticed she was dead.  Three weeks she was there?  Three weeks.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's what we were explaining in the beginning, you know.  She's a lonely old lady that found love with her pet.  Lonely old lady.  Rascal's vet said Matilda was very attached to the chubby dog.  Chubby.  The dog was chubby, which means it had to eat.  I got to eat.  I'm hungry.  Chubby rascal.  She was a very nice lady.  She just loved that dog.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Aw.  And that's a pet groomer that said that when she used to go to buy the outfits, Sam.  The little outfits.  The little rascal.  Chubby rascal.  Do you have one in a chubbier size, do you?  Oh, he's.  I got to put him on a little diet, but I spoil him.  I spoil rascal.  I spoil the little guy.  Michael, what's going on?  As he just rips your thigh meat off the bone.  Fast forward.  You're dead.  He's ripping your thigh meat off of your bone. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I passed the house today, Huntington.  Oh, yeah?  Where is it?  New York Avenue, right behind the Walt Whitman Mall by Tower Records.  New York Avenue.  All right.  I know where that is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, right across from the dog grooming place.  Directly across is police tape all around it and an officer on the yard.  I got to drive by on the way home.  You got to do the drive by.  I love seeing where people die.  Isn't that great?  I went on a great tour in L.A., but that's a story for another day.  You know, people died in a house I used to live in on Long Island.  You told that story?  Yeah, right after we moved out. 
[00:48:00]  It was the family that moved in right after that.  And wasn't it?  DeFeo's?  No, it wasn't the DeFeo's.  Amityville, right?  No, but wasn't this story featured on the news and stuff?  Yeah.  And they're showing footage of your living room where you grew up and had all those lovely Christmas and stuff?  Yeah, lovely memories.  You got to tell that story again.  Yeah, we moved out, and it was in Huntington, by the way.  And a very small, secluded street behind Fred's Diner.  You know where that is, Opie?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:48:30]  Jericho Turnpike over there.  And it seems a father moved in with a little boy and a little girl.  They were, I guess, 9 and 11, something like that, maybe a little older, early teens.  And the father comes home from work one day, knocks on the door.  It's safe to leave the doors locked, you know.  But, hey, it's Daddy.  Let Daddy in.  So the kids run to the loving father, open the door.  There's the foyer. 
[00:49:00]  I remember putting the linoleum tile that I saw on the news down on the floor, helped Mom out.  I bet you you put your little snow boots on that linoleum after you went sledding.  Can't drip on the rug.  Don't drip on the rug.  I'd come in from playing, and my mom would be sitting on the couch.  Your mittens that were safety pinned together, you'd probably just pull them off, throw them on the linoleum.  Throw them on the linoleum.  Mom would get to them.  She'll get to them.  Or maybe she'd tell me, hey, you, you pick those up, you.  And I'd say, oh, Mom, go back to your mitt. 
[00:49:30]  Is this on?  I'm kidding.  Don't get upset, Sal.  It's called a callback.  That's a great callback.  One of the best bits that have never been replayed.  That have never, ever been replayed.  And then Daddy came to the door.  Not your Daddy.  No, no.  This is after you left this fine house with the linoleum.  Yeah, this is the new family that moved in, the father and two kids.  The kids opened the door to say hi to Daddy, and Daddy fired a .45 caliber bullet into each of their skulls. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, God.  It's not necessary.  You dumb rube.  This was the family that moved in right after you guys left.  Yes.  Hey, I'm from the South.  And then what?  This was featured on the news and everything?  Oh, yeah.  It was a huge story.  You don't get the big triple homicide thing, because then he killed himself right there in  the hallway.  I remember carrying in and out the Christmas trees from, and, hey, let me go get the sled. 
[00:50:30]  And, you know, I'll go knock on Leanne Marinelli's door and see if she wants to come out and play.  You know, in that kid kind of way.  Not in the adult way.  Yeah.  That was junior high.  Hello.  And that was what happened, yeah.  It was murder in my house.  Did they say what the kids had done wrong?  Oh, apparently they did something wrong.  Little bastards.  Did they ever figure it out, though?  No.  They had no theory?  The guy went crazy.  I think he'd have had trouble at work or something. 
[00:51:00]  But it was creepy, you know, because a lot of our pictures, you know, you go through  your family albums to this day, and you see yourself as a kid, are taken in that house.  You see yourself as a kid in your Halloween costume.  Ah, just knocking on the door.  Trick or treat.  Kissing mom, standing on that linoleum.  Right.  Yeah.  Trick or treat.  Trick or treat.  Ah.  No, last name wasn't Yates, either.  I don't remember what the hell the name was. 
[00:51:30]  That's sick.  Yeah.  It kind of ruins your pictures, your family pictures, when you look back and you see the  house, and it was the same angle shot that was in the newspaper.  How do you think Yates' husband feels looking at the family shots?  He's got to cut five heads out.  It's just him now.  Oh, God damn it.  Leaving the little Alfonso Soriano-looking kid.  Oh, sure you save a few bucks at Christmas.  All right, I can't. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, come on, Opie.  It's on Opie's line.  All right.  That's what that's.  Oh, just look at it.  Doesn't it just...  How can you not give her the death penalty?  How can you not...  I don't care if she was depressed.  You know why, again, just like the stupid ass, the Taliban guy.  Yeah.  They work it.  These lawyers are scumbags, and they will twist and turn this thing, where she will be  put in this nice little mental home, where she won't have to worry about some screw making 
[00:52:30]  the rounds and doing it with a broom handle.  And eventually, she'll get out and say, I'm cured.  And she does have awful, stringy hair.  That's what bugs me more than anything, with my glasses.  Put that hair under some water with some soap.  Like your kids.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, it's great. 
[00:53:00]  You are horrible.  And you know what?  You dummies out there, you won't give her the death penalty.  I don't want to hear about her depression.  And the husband's defending her, right?  That's exactly it.  That's amazing.  He should be shot, and she should be shot.  Take her out back and put a bullet in her.  All right, Tom.  Will that little rascal get to her?  Hey, unleash little rascal.  The chubby little dog.  Chubby rascal.  He's a chubby little dog, isn't he?  Eating fingers out of the tub.  Body's mine.  He's chewing on this old broad.  She must have been like beef jerky, too, you know?  Like a little jerky. 
[00:53:30]  You got to think he went side.  You think side?  Side torso.  How much for a rib?  Tom.  I'm thinking limbs.  All right.  Anyway, I got a good friend of mine.  She had a dead guy fall through her apartment ceiling.  What?  Yeah.  The guy was dead for about two months, three months.  Yeah.  Died in his bed, basically liquefied in the mattress, and all the acid and everything else  left in the body, ate through the mattress, ate through the floor, through the plaster, 
[00:54:00]  the concrete, came right through her living room.  No way am I buying this story.  Come on.  I swear to God.  Someone's got to call an expert and tell us if this is possible.  God, man.  The acid that's left in the body burned through all that and ended up in your, what, girlfriend's  apartment?  No, not my girlfriend.  She's just a friend of mine.  It happened in Chelsea.  No way.  And the body comes falling through the ceiling.  Came through the ceiling and basically went splat all over the place. 
[00:54:30]  The smell, the maggots, everything.  It was just absolutely nauseating.  I can't, I don't think, I don't think that's possible.  I don't know if I'm buying this one.  I'll tell her to call you guys.  I'll have her call Rick and she can explain the whole story.  He wasn't in a scuba suit and it was in a forest fire, wasn't it, when he fell out?  No?  No?  Okay.  Just got to clear that up.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  One good thing about this, these, these, the dogs that attacked this lady in California  is that both of the... 
[00:55:00]  California?  What are you talking...  Where are you?  Where are you?  Um, it was on the...  It's in the...  We were talking about a dog in Huntington.  No, no, I'm saying that there's another dog attack story.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  It's just that both of them, uh, the defendants are lawyers who are probably both going to  go to jail because their dogs ate people.  I thought that would tie in nicely.  Apparently, I was incorrect.  My apologies.  Do you know the, uh...  I really stink.  I thought I had a thought there and I'm really...  I'm babbling in front of 18 cities.  Continue. 
[00:55:30]  Do you know that, uh, what's his name?  Russell Yates, the father?  Yeah.  Ah, yes.  Back to the funny stuff.  He's got...  He has a website set up.  Still don't know what he was trying to go for.  I don't know.  I thought I had a thought.  Well, what's the other...  I'm sorry, Ann.  Hold on a second.  All right.  Because I don't understand that.  What was the other dog story?  Well, there is a story in, uh, Los Angeles about two master...  Two monster dogs that mauled a woman.  Right.  Oh, but there's sex in that story, too.  Oh, believe me.  You think that didn't get me a little blood going?  Of course it did.  Have you heard about this?  Oh, no.  It's sick. 
[00:56:00]  There's, uh, two dogs that, uh, it's the one that ate that woman in the hallway, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was coming back from grocery shopping or something, and the dogs ate her in the hallway.  Now it turns out there's all kinds of allegations going on that the owners of these dogs would have sex with the dogs and film it.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  Back to the office.  It's great.  I didn't even hear that.  Sex with dogs.  Bring out the peanut butter.  Surprise, Daddy!  I don't see anything about that here.  I heard.  It's late-breaking.  Late-breaking news. 
[00:56:30]  Uh, the Yates kids.  Go ahead.  There's a website that the father put together to raise money for the wife, for the defense fund.  It's, uh, if you want to check it out, it's eatabullet.com.  Oh, I got that confused.  Wait a minute.  That's, uh, that's noise.  And the five birthday parties are sold out.  Jesus.  Now, yateskids.org.  But the guy put pictures of his dead kids up.  They're not dead in the pictures.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  I'm surprised.  This guy's a fiend.  He's just as twisted as she is.  And on the same page where his dead children's pictures are,  you can click and, uh, show where you can send money to defend that animal that, uh, uh, killed the kids.  What is it?  Is it www.blubblub.com?  Glub-glub with a G-L-U-V.  Glub-glub.  Horrid.  How does a man do?  You know, you got to think he snapped.  You got to think he snapped.  How do you then defend? 
[00:57:30]  First of all, you ain't getting none.  She's in prison.  So, cut sex off of the list of why you're doing it.  Thirdly, that stringy hair.  And her awful dumb...  She's good.  She's not a good mother.  She has bad hair.  She has bad eyesight.  There's nothing redeeming about her.  He's free.  He should be dating.  He's just lost his mind.  His whole family is dead.  And he's got to...  What's he going to do?  I mean, she's gone and the kids are gone and all that room and nothing to do with it.  Get a smaller pad, pal.  Bob, what's going on? 
[00:58:00]  Hey, what's going on?  I want to ask you, man.  He's put a few Cribs for Sale sign up.  What's up, Bob?  I don't know much.  That guy with that body falling through the ceiling story?  What a load of crap that is, man.  Yeah, that...  I was a paramedic in the Bronx for six years.  I see more dead bodies than I can shake a stick at.  And none of them do that.  First of all, the maggots don't stick around no longer.  If you live in the same building, that thing's going to smell so bad, you're going to call  somebody after a couple of days.  I was buying it, sort of, until he said...  Then he went through the concrete.  Yeah, really.  Sir, more bodies than you can...  You see more bodies than you can what? 
[00:58:30]  Shake a stick at.  What are the bodies I've seen?  How many of you shake a stick at?  Lord knows.  He tried to count.  He knows that's the type of...  The brand of humor we're looking for on this show.  That's our brand of humor.  Yes, yes.  Whatever.  I just think I've got to call it.  It's all right, guys.  We'll have to tell him that story.  If he buys it, he's pretty gullible.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  We've got a cameraman on the phone, hopefully.  Ed?  Yeah, how are you doing?  You're not BSing us, are you?  I am not BSing you. 
[00:59:00]  I was there all afternoon yesterday.  You are?  At the dog eating the old lady.  Yep, basically a piece of her hand and a piece of her forearm was in the sidewalk in front  of our house.  What do you do?  I'm a cameraman.  Oh, yeah?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  The hand's on the sidewalk in the front of the house and no one's noticing?  Yeah, apparently none.  A little rascal just dragged it out there, probably.  And you got footage of this?  Uh, yeah.  Can you bring it by?  Could you bring it here?  Well, you should have watched the news yesterday.  You guys didn't.  No, you didn't.  You don't put goddamn body part footage on the news. 
[00:59:30]  Stop it.  I know we're starting to show dead bodies on the news and stuff, but you guys won't show  body parts.  They still got to be far away.  I'll bet little rascal was trying to get her to the hospital one piece at a time.  I got the cops taking pictures of it and stuff, but I tried to put it on there, but my  reporter wouldn't let it happen.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Ed.  Bye.  I'm not, uh...  Suck.  I'm not buying that.  No one's cursing at himself. 
[01:00:00]  He's drooling on himself.  What's wrong?  What happened?  Shut my...  Oh, no.  What's wrong?  What happened there, Jimmy?  I thought your little dog story was cute.  It stunk.  Oh, boy, what I missed.  I don't even come close.  I noticed a guy that was, uh, trying a little bit over there.  Oh, I should have just shut up and waited.  Stop trying to make the moment happen, weak Jim. 
[01:00:30]  It'll come.  Chris, what's up?  Oh, how you doing?  You gotta leave Norton alone.  He finally comes through with a little show prep on a story, and you have no idea what he  talks about.  You're right, sir.  Because I figured one dog story was good enough for the show today, and I picked the better  one.  Yeah.  He's doing some research, and he's doing it good, too.  You guys stink.  Gotta go.  He was talking about dogs, and then that's why the lawyer should get...  What?  I don't know.  I don't know where I saw it. 
[01:01:00]  Because the dog story I was talking about had nothing to do with a lawyer, and you were  trying to compare the two with lawyers.  No, because he was trashed.  I was just saying the good thing is that they're both lawyers, the dog owners.  But who cares?  Why did I have to mention it?  I didn't.  I should have shut up with my thin lips and let the show flow the way it was going.  I ruined it.  All right.  A little blubbery, pale zero.  Wow.  Look at this.  This should be on Foundry Music.  Look. 
[01:01:30]  Look at it.  It's so rude.  I know.  He pulls up his...  Show it.  Show it.  Oh, God.  Pulls up his shirt, and...  You don't even have a hint of a muscle.  No.  Not even a hint.  And I'm wearing a Max Muscle shirt.  Max Muscle.  Christopher Reeve's thigh tone muscle was sold out, so I bought Max.  That's great.  JD, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a story for you guys. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  I got a friend who works in an adult bookstore.  Guy comes in one night, goes into one of the movie booths.  He's in there for like three hours.  So finally his boss says to him, he goes, it's time for that guy to get out.  So he knocks on the door.  He's pounding on the door.  He's like, yo, dude, it's time to get out.  So nothing happened.  So what they do is they jimmy the lock.  The guy falls out.  His hand's still on his member.  And he's like cold as ice, stiff as a rock. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Thanks, JD.  Yeah.  All right.  How big was he, sir?  We're going to play the silent game by Westwood One that syndicates our show.  They haven't heard the show, I guess.  So when they hear us play the silent game, they dump the feed.  They freak out.  They think it's dead air.  I think it's accidental dead air.  If you're going to support a show and syndicate a radio show, maybe you should listen to the  show and know what kind of bits they do so you can be prepared.  Remember we were doing the silent game the other day with Scott Farrell?  And all of a sudden.  They thought that was dead air. 
[01:03:00]  So they're like, oh, they're off the air.  And they went to something else.  It's not their brand of syndicated show.  What station?  All of them.  All of them?  It's the feed.  They dumped out of the whole feed because they thought we had dead air.  Because they don't know all our bits, I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  Too bad they didn't dump out of my attempt at a dog story joke.  I'm sure that went through.  Come on.  Well, there's a guy in San Francisco that's going to help you out.  Guy?  Yes.  What's up?  I've been following this story. 
[01:03:30]  It actually happened a year ago, a couple miles from where I was living in San Francisco at  the time.  A couple of lawyers were holding on to some dogs for one of their clients who they adopted  while he was in prison.  Yeah.  Apparently, he was raising them to be fighting dogs.  And the dogs got out, mauled the neighbor, tore out her stomach and her throat.  And one of the witnesses said that it looked like the male dog may have been trying to mate  with the victim at the time.  Allegations have gone around that the female lawyer, who is now the defendant, may have been 
[01:04:00]  having some bestial relations with the dog, and that these pictures are on the Internet.  Hey, Guy.  Yeah.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a security guard.  You want to do a radio show with Ant and I?  That could be fun.  He was precise, to the point.  Crystal clear.  Got it all out.  No flubbing.  We were able to follow the whole story from beginning to end.  Yeah.  There was a beginning, a middle, and an end. 
[01:04:30]  Very quick.  And now I know the whole story.  How are you with pedophile jokes?  You better be prepared, sir.  Yeah, I'm better with the real thing.  Very good, Guy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, mister.  Mister.  Thank you, mister, man.  All right.  You know what?  When we get back, we've got to spend a little time with this 55-gallon drum challenge.  We've got to get the ladies motivated for this.  Oh, hell yeah.  We'll have the details next.  Frenchie versus Tom.  Uh-huh.  A little bit of what happened really late in the show. 
[01:05:00]  We'll play it as we go to break, Anthony.  Tom got killed by Frenchie.  Yeah.  I hope everyone knows who Tom is.  Tom's from New Orleans.  Our big station manager guy.  One of the head muckety mucks.  Right.  Down in New Orleans.  So he called in, and Frenchie went at it.  Tom from New Orleans is checking back in, Anthony.  He's back.  How you doing, Tom?  Hey, Tom.  My battery really was going dead.  Where is that?  My battery.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Let me tell you something, man. 
[01:05:30]  My bad.  You have beautiful eyes.  What?  How are we?  You have beautiful blue eyes.  Get naked.  Shook him.  I make the French fry, and I'm headed.  Ah, classic rock station.  Beautiful ass.  Jesus Christ, we know this, man.  Beautiful ass.  You have beautiful eyes.  I figure skate.  I'm not going to drop the F-bomb.  And I cannot.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Shut up.  You homo.  I might have a couple of beers, but I'm no homo like you, you French faggot.  Calm my toes like Paddy Tony.  I got no problem with that. 
[01:06:00]  You know?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Jesus Christ, we know this, man.  You have beautiful eyes.  You're not going to stop.  I love the color of your eyes.  Stupid French homo.  Get rid of that dude, man.  Stop drinking blue salt, you drunk F.  You drink hillbilly?  Yeah, I hear you.  Hey, I'm from the South.  I drink beer until I pass out.  Because I got nothing else to do.  Don't you have a job, you French fruitcake?  Are we on your air today, Tom? 
[01:06:30]  Do you like?  That's the question I got to ask you.  Do you like?  Do you like?  Have a beer.  What do you do?  What do you do, LeBer?  What do you do, LeBer?  Faggot.  What do you do, LeBer?  Son, douchebag.  LeBer?  Can't you go make me a strudel?  You stupid hick bastard.  Go make me a strudel.  Go make me a strudel, you hammer.  How that big-breasted wife of you is here.  You hammer, she does not have big breasts.  How you guys doing? 
[01:07:00]  How about that well-hung boy in front of yours, Fachi?  My bad.  How about that well-hung boy in front of yours?  My bad.  Hey, Jesus Christ, we're in New Orleans.  You dumb rube.  You are such a gay eff.  I bang your wife.  F.  Your hot wife.  Yeah, I'm sure she wants you, dude.  I drop a lot of goo.  A lot of goo.  Why are you not drunk yet, you douchebag?  Wash your teeth sometime, you douche.  You're going to stretch my teeth. 
[01:07:30]  That's a good one.  Brett stinks, you fat eff.  That's a good one.  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing, you drunk bastards?  How are you guys doing?  You let a whole freaking...  When you go back home and drink a couple of cold ones, you douche.  Wow, Frenchy.  I have a couple of cold ones on me, huh?  Too much, Tom.  We have.  All right, I hung up on Tom.  I'm turning Frenchy's mic off for the day.  Wow, Frenchy. 
[01:08:00]  Bravo, Frenchy.  Yeah.  What a performance.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  All right, let me get a little saucy here.  Oh, for the love of Eve, you bet.  Life serves you up lemons, you make lemonade.  We're a little out of control here.  Stop cracking wise.  Oh, my stars.  Just go f*** yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  A lot of ass grabbing.  Horrific and tasteless.  People going deaf.  Just makes me want to stick a knife in someone.  Stuff you get here on this show. 
[01:08:30]  Aren't we supposed to be trying to gain listeners' good?  No!  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is that a surprise to you?  Yeah.  And E.W.  We're back with The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P.  Yes, Anthony.  Much to Norton's disgust, I have to plug a fine couple of people last night on the EverQuest  adrenal server.  What's the matter, Norton? 
[01:09:00]  You never like when I talk computer games.  I actually don't mind at all.  You don't?  No.  You look at me like I'm a fag or something.  I look at you like that every morning.  Wow.  I have nothing.  What were you trying to say there?  How else should I look at you?  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Wow.  You are really tongue-tied.  I just...  What's wrong with you today, Jim?  Absolutely nothing.  I actually don't mind when you talk computer games.  It's not my thing, but there's a million people that like it.  Sure.  Are you all right? 
[01:09:30]  Hookers and Sabbath.  I just...  No.  I'm just...  I can't talk today.  I can't talk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get those days, though.  It's not like you're...  Sure.  It's not like you're wrecking the show or anything.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, dude.  I am really...  You too, it doesn't...  Look, I apologize to the blood of people out there that are driving and really are just  like, just shut your fat, meaty little mouth.  I can't have anything.  It's dope or anything?  It's not like people are in some feedback and not saying this show sucks today.  Don't worry about it.  Let them in some feedback.  Put it on the message board.  I don't like him because...  LOL. 
[01:10:00]  Scumbags.  LOL.  Yeah.  Oh, L-M-A-O-R-O-A-F.  How about that thing he said eight months ago?  Was Florentine trash in a...  No, he wasn't stupid.  Oh, God.  Florentine did not trash O&A anywhere.  Yeah, our message board has become a mess.  Yeah.  I don't mind if Faxer posted.  I like the message board.  I love Froy, not just because he has goddamn good abs.  Froy's a good guy, and I don't think it's his fault, but there's a lot of ass munches  on the message board.  You know, if they don't like the show, then stop posting. 
[01:10:30]  I assume when I go to an Opie and Anthony message board that it's going to be more positive  than negative.  No, no.  At this point, people just trash every little thing we do.  Now it's ridiculous.  They're supposedly our hardcore fans.  You get posts from people that don't understand.  Maybe people's listening habits aren't like yours, and it's not 24 hours.  There's a day listening to this show, so if you heard something once, and you hear it  again on Best Of, I heard it already.  Hey, ass.  99% of the people didn't.  Jack off.  They think everyone, their habits are exactly the same as yours. 
[01:11:00]  No, they're not.  So instead of posting, God, funny the first time, second time, ugh.  Then go outside and live a life, Jack tool.  I should talk.  I'm playing computer games 24 hours a day.  It was kind of cool in the beginning.  We had Opie and Anthony message boards.  It was kind of fun to, I don't even, I don't even go there anymore.  No.  No.  Because it's, it's just a bunch of people that, you know, just try to find anything wrong 
[01:11:30]  with the show and post it.  Now it's a big trash fest.  They pick at every little thing.  You know, it's a, it's a radio program.  Relax.  It's kind of sad.  It's our lives and our jobs, so we take a little more seriously than maybe you should.  You know what I mean?  If you heard something, geez, at 440, between 441 and 445, that, gee, didn't make you laugh.  Oh, sorry, let me post how, gee, they suck now.  I don't care if people, like, post opinions. 
[01:12:00]  That's cool.  But when someone blatantly lies like that.  Oh, I know.  About Florentine.  Right.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I'm really annoyed.  Snorton's roommate.  You know, the post thing about Florentine, I didn't even, I didn't even think twice about it.  I knew you would.  I don't even think, I don't even think twice about any of that stuff anymore.  It's kind of sad because the message board thing was a great idea at first, but now it's  just a bunch of, it will always mutate to that point.  At the beginning, a message board for anything, for anything or any body or any event, always 
[01:12:30]  starts out one way, but then it seems people get, like, power hungry, I guess, or, you  know, big headed.  There have been people that have been on this show on the phones that have just turned  into ass wipes because they have been on the show.  And now they're better than anyone else that's posting on the message board.  And then there's a lot of new people that want to get on the message board because, you  know, it's new to them and they don't even have a chance on it.  Right. 
[01:13:00]  Ugh.  Because they don't post the right way, so then they trash them and ban them and kick  them off.  Please.  I actually like most of those guys a lot.  There's some funny people, man.  There really are some funny.  There is some, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're all coming from there.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's just gotten completely out of hand.  Anyway.  Out of control.  Back to the computer game.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yes.  Ted Yule and Zod.  Ted Yule and Zod from the Cats in Hats Guild.  I see. 
[01:13:30]  I knew he'd start laughing.  On the adrenal server of EverQuest, Norton.  Why?  No.  Look at him laughing.  He put his head in his hands and started laughing hysterically.  They got me my jaundice bone bracer.  I was very excited last night when I got that.  Thanks for calling me and letting me know so I could get to sleep.  There I am at seven in the morning not knowing.  But you know what else?  I was getting harassed and annoyed by people that I don't believe are real characters.  That have been playing for a while.  I don't think Jim Norton's balloon knot is a character that bad. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  And let me tell you.  You can't just log in like a message board.  You have to make a character.  Give it a name and get into the game.  Frenchie then came up and started talking to me.  Frenchie and Jim Norton's balloon knot.  So that was really cool.  They hooked me up.  Thanks, guys.  I'm Anthony.  Yeah.  I hate to interrupt this exciting conversation.  It's a love fest.  I think we all need to have a little sing-along. 
[01:14:30]  A sing-along?  A little sing-along.  I'm all for sing-alongs.  My cute little cousin.  I think he's, how old is he now?  14, I believe, Anthony.  Yeah.  Don't call a guy cute at 14.  Well, he's my cousin, though.  They don't like that.  He's cute.  They don't like that.  He is.  My little cousin.  We were on a family function and he sang a song.  Yeah?  And my family begged me to play it on the radio.  Uh-huh.  Because I'm a big radio star. 
[01:15:00]  They thought it would be a little kick to the family.  Does he want to be a singer?  Um, yeah, it's one of his hobbies.  Yeah, all right.  Between playing video games and going to the carnival.  And fighting off Uncle Greg.  So, uh...  He thinks he's cute.  So, I told my family I would, uh...  I would play a little Jimmy song here.  All right.  So, can we go to the tape now?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Um...  God bless America. 
[01:15:30]  In the land of the moon.  Sit aside her.  And guide her.  Her son of the land of the above.  So, decide her.  And guide her.  As you live, I decide.  God bless America. 
[01:16:00]  My home, sweet home.  God bless America.  My home, sweet home.  The preceding announcement has been paid for by the pro-abortion forces of America.  Dude, that's my little cousin. 
[01:16:30]  What's wrong with you?  What?  That's my little cousin.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Is that...  Is that...  You don't like his singing?  No, it's okay.  God bless America.  Big tongue in the way.  He really does have no range.  But he's got...  He can hold the note.  He just started singing.  He's learning still.  Fourteen, huh?  Yeah.  What?  What's wrong?  You just figure if maybe fourteen years and seven months ago... 
[01:17:00]  That's called Let's Just Start Over.  Let's just start it over.  It's God's will.  Rub-a-dub-dub five kids in a tub.  I don't get it.  Well, that was not your cousin.  What?  Just Jimmy.  Little Jimmy.  Little Jimmy.  My cousin Jimmy. 
[01:17:30]  Fourteen.  Fourteen.  What?  That's what I'm saying.  Paul from Center for Hitch is saying, Corky Hughes.  It's a little Jimmy.  Family's proud of him.  He should be.  He'll grow up.  He'll tend the rabbits.  Thank you, Kev.  Boys, I become creeping around.  That's great.  If you have something to say, why don't you say it?  I don't care what you're getting at.  Your retarded nephew sounds retarded. 
[01:18:00]  I ain't mad, Lenny.  I ain't never been mad.  All I know is I did the right thing today.  All right.  Were you told to play that?  Because I can't imagine that you would want to put a relative in that embarrassing situation.  Does that run in your family at all?  What?  Bad singing?  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  He doesn't sound right.  Is he right?  He's just bad at singing.  I mean, what does he do?  What does he do?  Does he go to school?  Goes to school.  How is he doing in school?  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  High school?  What is he, in junior high?  He's not at the top of his class.  Is it a long bus that picks him up in the morning, or would you call it a smaller bus?  It's a smaller bus.  Is he not into sports, yet wears a sporting-type helmet? 
[01:19:00]  Did he have a big stomach and pubic hair by the age of seven?  When he gets his hair cut, does he ask for Asian guy or Moe Howard and nothing else?  I don't think he really has a choice in the matter, Anthony.  I figured I'd share.  F you all.  Could he lick 20 stamps at once with that huge mongoloid tongue? 
[01:19:30]  No?  I'm sorry.  He's getting upset now.  All right.  Knock it off.  Sorry.  Patricia, what's up?  Hey, I got something to add to this 55-gallon drum challenge.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  I have turtles.  Turtles?  No, no, no.  I'm not going to throw the turtles in there.  I'd give you that foul, nasty water that I have to change every two weeks.  Yeah, we could use old turtle water. 
[01:20:00]  Does it have turtle poo in it?  Oh, yes, it does.  You know what?  We have to get ladies for this 55-gallon drum challenge.  Just to call them old turtle water.  Hold on a line.  We'll take your old turtle water.  Cool.  All right.  Big Kev's got a turtle.  He's got a sick friggin' turtle.  How big?  How big is this thing?  He's about medium size.  He's a snapper.  Yeah, a snapper.  Yeah.  You know what happened at Big Kev's Christmas party?  Big Kev's, the big event was everyone gathered around the turtle tank as Big Kev dumped in 
[01:20:30]  a bunch of goldfish and we watched his turtle devour live fish like Godzilla.  The thing would bite, like it bit the tail off of one and the one just went spinning off  into the corner and we just sat around waiting for it to devour another one.  It's very sick and twisted.  It's very ferocious.  And the tank, how does it smell and how is the water?  You don't want to, you really don't want to use that water.  No.  No, there's salmonella.  We'll take it.  We'll take it then.  I like it.  I think they were having a similar Christmas party over there in Huntington a few weeks 
[01:21:00]  back.  He comes up, right?  With a rascal.  Little rascal.  Little rascal.  What's his name, Kev?  Ichabod.  Ah, there you go.  Not as cute as rascal.  You buy him little clothes?  Does he ride a horse with no head, does he?  Craig, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Will the turtle bite you if you touch it?  Yes, he's bitten me off.  That's why I hate reptiles.  Yeah.  There's no love there.  They stink.  That's like the guy that got killed by the big python last week or so. 
[01:21:30]  There's no loyalty in these dumb animals.  But they'll tell you, no, he shows affection, he recognizes me, knows me.  Yeah, because their face has so many different expressions.  My turtle's face just looks at me and I just know he wants to kill me.  Of course he does.  You're the character.  Of course, if I owned a turtle and that thing bit me, I would take my fist, I would turn  it over on its stupid shell and I would plant my fist in the middle of its soup belly.  And look ridiculous to him.  And I would put him back.  I wouldn't kill him. 
[01:22:00]  I would pow right in the spot.  It's soup belly.  Bite me again, you slow nothing, and you're dead.  It bit Kev.  Yeah.  It bit my finger in half, actually.  Why would you even do it?  I know.  Why have it?  I don't get it.  How slow do you have to be that a turtle bites you?  Pull its little awful reptile fetal.  Opie, don't be deceived.  They're like lightning.  Yeah, very fast.  Well, yeah, he beat the rabbit in the race.  A little message for you kids.  Slow and steady gets it done.  That's our brand of humor. 
[01:22:30]  A little more structure down here in D.C.  We elected Mary and Barry, and now we're going to give Tyson a license.  D.C. stinks.  Stop making fun of our listeners.  Not the listeners.  It's the ones that aren't listeners.  Oh, okay.  Well, the ones that are listening, though, are the ones that are going to get pissed off.  The ones you want to trash are the ones that aren't listening to us.  Exactly.  Craig, what's up?  Yeah, listen, Opie, I just wanted to know, when, you know, friends ask about your nephew,  and they say, you know, what's one of his best traits? 
[01:23:00]  It's cousin.  Cousin, I'm sorry.  Do you say, well, he's really strong.  He's really strong.  Yeah, you've got to start, man.  Be good.  He can count to four and carry a piano four miles.  I may be a little slow here, but I really don't get what's going on.  I thought I'd share it with you all, and this is what I get in return.  Did you hear that?  I know his singing's bad, but someone out there got a thrill.  Do you hear how I ruined that one, too?  I stink today, and I know I stink today.  I say he can count to four and carry a piano four miles. 
[01:23:30]  He was the same number on the joke twice.  Wow, now you're getting way too picky.  That's true, though.  That's an absolute no-no.  You never do that.  It's an absolute no-no.  He can count to four and carry a piano two blocks.  Pow!  Wow, that might have been amusing.  Right.  But not the way I did it.  Four, no.  Barrels straight ahead with the obvious.  I don't think you lost too much.  Using the four twice.  It might have stunk to begin with.  I could have probably salvaged...  Because I think people were expecting two different numbers, and you used the same one, which made it kind of...  Oh, you pulled a little wham-a-rooney on them.  They were possibly...  Yeah, I did, because they were possibly expecting something humorous. 
[01:24:00]  And that's what I gave them.  You just know you know when you stink.  You just know it.  Junk mail, Jerry, from the city.  Coming soon.  Mrs. Yates starring in Honey, I Sunk the Kids.  Five little crullers.  All right.  We got, I think, more songs from Jimmy and other people that are being carded up right now, aren't they?  Well, I thought I'd share today, yeah.  Yeah, so you got some more? 
[01:24:30]  It sounds like, from some of the piece of one song, that you have a niece, maybe, that might sing, too.  Is that true, Opie?  Well, it's, yeah, Jimmy's twin.  It's Jimmy's twin.  Jessica.  Ah, Jessica and Jimmy.  Aw.  Isn't that cute?  Any problem with them having the first letter of their names?  No.  Norton, no?  Not at all.  Maybe that would screw it up.  Probably.  But twins...  See, the reason I went with that, though, that's how twins are named.  I got it completely.  And probably your favorite movie is Jumanji. 
[01:25:00]  I got a song from Little Jessica on the way.  All right.  I can't wait to hear it.  Orlando, what's up?  What's up, yeah?  Does your cousin grin a lot for no reason?  Stinky rules.  I don't care what you guys are getting at.  He's a very happy kid.  Grin a lot.  He's a very happy kid.  I don't doubt it.  Happy at everything.  Do you think 9-11 is a store run by Indians?  Does he stare at blinking neon signs for a long time?  He likes to smile a lot. 
[01:25:30]  Smiles.  Happy kid.  Does he watch TV?  Mm-hmm.  Cartoons?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Just asking.  Sounds like a happy little fella.  Yeah.  A little rascal.  I'm not going to share any more songs with you guys, because I think you'd...  No, no, no.  If you punch his face, does he cry and apologize?  Wow, a naked girl.  Hey, this is Kylie and Moe.

[01:27:30]  Old Jimmy.  Yeah, right.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Oh, but I just got two really quick questions about your cousin.  Yeah.  Does he give strangers really big hugs?  And...  Well, he's an affectionate kid, sure.  Okay, and has he ever climbed the water tower and giggled at the siren all the way to the  police station after he's been arrested?  He's too young to do that.  He's only 14.  14.  Oh, okay.  All right, thanks, Paul.  No problem.  What an interest, Anthony.  Yeah.  Got a song from my little cousin, Jessica. 
[01:28:00]  A little cousin, Jessica?  Jimmy's twin.  Ah, sounds nice.  That's sweet.  And I like how patriotic, uh, Lil, what's his name?  Lil Jimmy.  Lil Jimmy is.  He was singing God Bless America in that, uh, Lil, Lil song.  Well, everyone feeling the patriotism, uh, lately.  Even the, uh, re...  The, um...  The family.  Family.  Even the younger family members.  Ah, that's what I meant to say. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  He understands what's been going on, and, uh...  Dude, it was just a song from my cousin.  What's the big deal?  You all right over there?  It's strange.  I think it's adorable.  Thank you.  I think he sounds like a boy.  I thought it was cute, and we rolled tape, that's all.  Yeah.  All right.  So, is this Jessica's, uh, song?  Mm-hmm.  Well, Rick, uh, just ran it in, sure.  Ah, let's hear that.  Probably cute.  Track one?  Yep.  Yeah?  It's not that Texas song?  Oh, you want Texas? 
[01:29:00]  For Jessica, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Which one was, uh...  That was track seven.  They did a few.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, it was like a whole concert thing.  Oh.  Because I just heard a girl's voice on the Texas thing.  That's my little cousin, Jessica, Anthony.  What?  What?  Sorry.  What did you say?  I didn't hear it.  I didn't mean to say, oh, these families are a bunch of...  What?  No.  No, they're just...  A bunch of what?  What?  Nice people that can sing, sing songs at family outings.  Nice.  All right. 
[01:29:30]  So, you want to hear a little Jessica?  Yeah, let's hear a little, little Jessica.  She sings a little, little, little, uh, differently than, uh, little Jimmy.  Oh, I should hope so.  So, this was at a, uh, a recent family function.  We thought it was cute.  The kids were kind of sitting around singing tunes.  Uh, Warren from Connecticut wants to know, if you're a little cousin, uh, does he cry in  the afternoon and run after the sun yelling for it to come back?  I don't really get that.  Does he run after the sun when the sun starts going down and yell for it to come back? 
[01:30:00]  He's usually inside by the time the sun goes down.  With a big, dopey smile on his face, no?  No.  All right.  That's the big deal.  Just a few kids sitting around at a family function singing.  We, we rolled tape, Anthony.  All right.  You know what?  I'm not playing this song.  Oh, come on now.  I'm looking forward to it.  No.  I think you guys are onto something here.  No.  I want to hear it.  This is a little Jessica.  She's 14 too, aunt.  Aw, isn't that cute?  All right.  14. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, uh, my aunt?  Yeah.  Was playing, uh...  Oh, helping out on, uh, the guitar.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Okay.  We're going to Texas.  We're going to Texas.  We're going to Texas.  Here we go.  Sing it, Jessica.  We're going to Texas. We're going to Texas. We're going to Texas. Here we go. 
[01:31:00]  The House of New Team in Amarillo. We're here to paint, so come run and have some fun.  We hope that you will come out to see us as we continue our journey across America. 
[01:31:30]  We're going to Texas. We're going to Texas. We're going to Texas. Here we go.  We're going to Texas. We're going to Texas. Here we go.  You know, I went to Austin, Texas, and I met a beautiful actress named Robin Christian 
[01:32:00]  from the movie Jesse James and the Doom, and she wrote me a nice letter from New York.  There was that beautiful woman from Painted Horses, Caroline St. Dennis.  Oh, Caroline. She was so good and most efficient.  My uncle.  She still is.  Yeah.  And she's 20 o'clock in Texas.  We're going to Texas. We're going to Texas. We're going to Texas. Here we go.  Woo! 
[01:32:30]  We're going to Texas. Yeah.  We're going to Texas. We're going to Texas.  Woo!  Yeah! Woo!  All right. Welcome to Austin, Texas.  There you go.  Sponsored by Andrea Yates, had a point.  What is that supposed to mean? You don't like her singing?  Just go tight in.  No, it's Texas.  I think it's not bad for 14.  I mean, 14 years old.  Interesting.  Hmm. 
[01:33:00]  Ah, Bill, what's going on?  Yeah, hey, yo. I was just wondering, is Sandy considering adoption by any chance?  Why would she consider that?  Well, isn't this sort of thing genetic by any chance?  What kind of...  Sandy and I, two cute people, we'll have a cute little kid.  Okay, and Norton? Jim?  Yes, mister?  Um, you might want to consider punching out Maverick.  Talk to you later, guys.  I got to plow through it, sir.  I have to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  I won't quit. 
[01:33:30]  We're going to turn this thing around.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  When they went to Texas, was the short bus waiting out front for a bunch of these window lickers, or what?  What's a window licker in it?  I think it's somebody that puts their face against short bus windows and licks it because they're crazy.  And the colors outside look so tasty, you think you can just lick them?  Just speeding past the little windows.  That's right.  You can almost taste them through the window. 
[01:34:00]  You'd be surprised the results you can get with, you know, a window in front of a zipper.  For sure.  You want to hear just one more?  All right, one more.  I brought in a lot of them, but it seems like...  From your family.  You guys aren't appreciating this like I thought you would.  I think they're adorable.  Yeah, it's very cute.  I thought this was a direction we could take the show in, share a little bit.  I don't see you bringing in any tapes from your family, Jim.  I don't have any tapes. 
[01:34:30]  I bring in tapes from my family, my retarded mother.  Okay.  I'm kidding.  I love my mommy.  She's not retarded.  No, but put some Jell-O shots in her.  Wow.  She can sing too.  All right.  Well, here's one more from my cousin.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Three, go.  I have a future for how she knew. 
[01:35:00]  I'm not a civil rights leader like Dr. Martin Luther King.  I'm not running for office.  I am an actor.  We're going to New York.  We're going to the set of All My Children.  Is this what goes through their minds?  I'm going to the actor of All My Children, too.  Susan, Lucci, All My Children. 
[01:35:30]  We went as the world turned on.  Hastings, Dr. Bob Hughes.  You stupid faggot.  Hey, Frenchy.  What are you doing, man?  What?  What are you doing?  Frenchy was chiming in.  I don't know why you had to use the word stupid.  I don't know if my cousin's gay or not.  What's wrong with you?  That was bad.  I apologize.  Something fell on the machine here, and the Frenchy clips were up. 
[01:36:00]  When you're down and up, there's one place to go.  Yeah.  It's called Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Jennifer Halloway.  Jennifer Halloway.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas. 
[01:36:30]  I perform with Jennifer Halloway.  Las Vegas.  Hey, I'm from the South.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  They're from Babylon.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Oh, my God.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas. 
[01:37:00]  That's nice.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Jennifer Halloway.  Jennifer Halloway.  Jennifer Halloway.  I perform with Jennifer.  Jennifer, Jennifer Halloway.  Jennifer Halloway.  I perform with Jennifer, Jennifer Halloway.  Las Vegas.  Oh, God.  Las Vegas.  It's almost over.  Las Vegas.  This is making my family very happy today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Las Vegas. 
[01:37:30]  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  How are you guys doing?  Las Vegas.  My bad.  Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  I drink beer until I pass out.  Las Vegas.  You belong in the dump in Staten Island. 
[01:38:00]  Las Vegas.  Hey, Jesus Christ.  We know it in.  Nice.  Yeah, that's good.  Ronnie, I love how you softened that.  Wow.  That's nice.  That's nice.  That's.  I hope that kid keeps the secret better than he holds a note.  Ooh.  All right.  Well, that's very cute, Opie.  Thank you.  That's a cute little family. 
[01:38:30]  Put this back in the CD case.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Save that.  Well, we're going to need that for the 14th of July party.  Paul from Centery Tones.  I know if you have any clips of F-Tard singing about a dryer door.  We walk two more miles.  We have all the candy.  I owe my daughter money and she, I'm dodging her.  One more clip.  Uh, double LC. 
[01:39:00]  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on?  What does the LC mean?  Uh, lonely little chick.  Isn't that funny?  Lonely little chick?  Yeah.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Cleveland.  Cleveland!  Hey.  She wants to be in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  I would love to be in it.  All right.  Uh, well, we got to get girls for this contest.  Mm-hmm.  I think we want to do it like a week from Friday.  A week from Friday?  I would like to.  Would you like to?  Well, I would love to, but then we're going to need girls.  We're going to need lots and lots of girls to come forward now and tell us what they 
[01:39:30]  would do to get into the 55-gallon drum, man, so we could torture you.  Right.  We're looking for brave girls that could stand a lot, right?  I think I'm brave enough to do it.  Really?  Yeah.  If you're jerking us around, we have to come to your house and kill you at this point.  We have to threaten all the girls with physical violence and death.  Oh, God.  I don't think I'm jerking you guys around.  All right.  What would you do to get in the...  See, this stinks because you're all the way in Cleveland. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  I know, and I...  We're trying to get girls to come down here to get...  I'm so willing to take the eight-hour drive, though.  Really?  Yeah.  You want to get here by tomorrow?  Tomorrow's not good because my boyfriend has to work, but I could possibly do it either Thursday  or Friday or next Monday.  Fine.  What would you like to do to try to impress us to be in the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Well, we thought of a few things.  I was going to go with something as cheesy as getting you guys name tattooed on me, which  is quite boring.  Yeah.  Or then I could go for the whole big yellow discipline thing from you guys in the studio 
[01:40:30]  like you, you and Opie and Jim Norton and even Black Earl.  Oh, everybody will just let one go on you.  Tickle and sickle cell all over you.  Oh, Jim Norton.  I like that headstand thing that one brought up for.  You know what?  Yeah, I think I should steal someone else's idea because she's not going to use it.  She blew us off.  How about if you do a headstand and do it to yourself?  Okay.  Yeah, we're still waiting for that. 
[01:41:00]  If you do that, we will give you a spot in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  If I do a headstand and give myself the golden, okay, I will definitely, okay.  Yeah, that's all you have to do.  You could do that, right?  We could do that.  All right.  I don't have to drink lots of liquid, but yeah, we could do that.  Are you going to blow us off like every other girl?  I'm not going to blow you off.  I love you guys to death.  I think Jim Norton is awesome.  I am sick of ladies blowing us off as far as this radio show goes.  If a guy says he's doing something, we can guarantee he's going to be here to do it.  Yeah, pain in the ass will be here in two seconds. 
[01:41:30]  But these girls that listen to this show, they call us up, tell us something they'll  do for the show, and then they never even show.  They never call to explain why they're not showing.  They stand us up.  They make us look completely foolish.  Well, you know, I'm going to be the first girl that doesn't do that.  I'll tell you what it is, DeVita.  I think a lot of them are really afraid that they're going to be made fun of and they're  not going to be doing it.  No.  No, no.  I'm saying that's why a lot of the girls, I think, are afraid to come.  If they don't know you guys are nice guys, they think you're going to rip on them.  Yeah, come on.  No, you're not.  All right.  They're going to have fun. 
[01:42:00]  So, Double LC will come from Cleveland.  You'll be here Friday or Monday?  I'll be here Monday.  It'll be there Monday to do that.  I will.  Monday, you do the headstand with the yellow discipline thing, and we guarantee you're in the 55-gallon  drum challenge.  Okay, works for me.  Jim is already shaking his head and saying that she's not going to show.  That you're not going to show.  Who said I'm not going to show?  Jim.  I don't think you will.  Not that you don't.  I'm sure you're sincere at the moment, but something will happen at the last minute that  you'll go, ah, it's a long drive or whatever, you know.  Just my...  Yeah, four words for you.  My mouth, your tool. 
[01:42:30]  You need to be quiet.  Whoa.  Wow.  I like that.  I like that.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We'll give you directions to the station, I guess, okay?  Okey-doke.  All right.  I mean, we've got to hope for the best here, because she's the only girl calling that wants  to be in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  You almost said, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.  Well, yeah.  Oh, that's our brand of humor.  Yeah.  Well, that's a good motto to live by.  Yeah.  All the time.  I stop myself, Mr. Chloroferm.  I live by that one.  I'm losing weight. 
[01:43:00]  Well, you hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.  Prepare for the worst.  That way, you're never disappointed.  All right.  We need more girls to call us at this point.  Well, you know what we need to do?  I'm hanging up on a lot of people right now to clear some phone lines, so hopefully some  ladies will call up for the 55-gallon drum challenge, okay?  We need to have a kick-ass prize that we announce, and all of a sudden, girls...  We do have a kick-ass prize.  It's between two things.  That's it.  Two huge.  Two huge things.  I swear.  Two huge.  Okay.  And tomorrow we can announce, because we're not going to get girls.  I'm guaranteeing you, we will not get girls until we give them some initiative. 
[01:43:30]  This is one of our bigger events that we do on our radio show.  Yeah.  People have been waiting well over a year for us to bring this back.  We finally bring it back, and we can't get girls.  And I don't know if it's because we scared them off, or maybe like that caller said, you  know, we're explaining all the stuff we're going to dump in the drums, and that's scaring  the girls as well.  Where are the girls from the last one?  I think we need a couple of the girls from the last time, yeah.  Definitely. 
[01:44:00]  I'm hanging up on all the Jimmy things.  But we can, but we can, you don't want to get all mad, but they can, we can announce  the prize tomorrow?  Yes.  All right.  We might even be able to announce it now, okay?  Yeah, let's see if we can, because I really think that's going to help out.  Is it Ricardo Montalbland's foreskin?  Montalbland?  Yeah, I was just going to leave it alone, Opie.  Did I say that right? 
[01:44:30]  Montalbland, sure.  Why not?  Montalbland, Montalbond.  How did I say it?  Montalbland.  Yeah, isn't that it?  What is it?  It's Montalbond.  Oh, whatever, that baboon.  I always thought it was that.  No matter how, even if I was on fire today, I still would have said it like that.  He tasks me.  Who cares?  He tasks me.  Stupid one gig getter.  40 years of acting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fantasy Island.  All right, Becky wants in on the 55 Gallon Jump Challenge.  Becky.  Hi.  Hey, hey, hey.  Where are you calling from?  Boston. 
[01:45:00]  Nice.  I want to represent the Boston girls out there.  Put creatures in our ears.  I'm sorry you're talking like a man.  Okay.  No, you sound all right.  I lost my voice and it's just coming back.  How'd you lose your voice, Becky?  I got really drunk and smoked two back-to-door rails in one night.  Oh, man.  Classy cigarette fill, eh?  That's a party chick right there, man.  Yeah.  So you want to be in the 55 Gallon Jump Challenge?  Yeah, I'll do anything to do it.  I was thinking...  We're holding tryouts, so...  I was thinking I could boil some sheep's eyes and dip them in chocolate and eat them. 
[01:45:30]  Woo!  That's pretty good.  Chocolate-covered sheep eyes.  That will get you in the 55 Gallon Jump.  All right, but I have to get down there.  So you guys have to convince BCN to send me down there because I'm broke.  Will you do this in the brown panties?  Yes, I will.  Should have went for the topless panties, right?  I'll go topless.  Yeah.  Ah.  Do you have a car?  We could, like, pay for gas?  I drove my car up a telephone pole.  Sorry.  Hey!  You're using that bad language.  I can tell myself not to swear to you.  She's using nasty language.  So you were effed up and you crashed your car into a pole, huh? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, I was on, like, 20 Klonopins.  20 Klonopins.  We need this girl in the contest.  Yeah, you're a party.  We definitely need this girl.  How are we going to work this out?  Amtrak.  Amtrak.  You want to take the choo-choo?  Yeah, definitely.  Are you working tomorrow?  No, I don't have a job.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Actually, okay.  You robbed.  Do you need a boyfriend?  Let me just say this.  And where are you going to get the sheep size?  There's a...  You're going to pluck them out of a sheep.  No, there's some places around here I could go. 
[01:46:30]  What?  Yeah.  Because I live right outside of Boston.  Well, you know, we're going to get a phone call in two seconds.  I will supply the fish eyes for this whore.  What?  Well, that kid who called in said he could get the cattle blood.  All right.  We need Becky down tomorrow to get the festivities going.  All right, Becky.  Hold on a line.  Rick's going to try to work out the details.  One more thing.  Yeah.  I want to go to Norton's show.  In what, Boston?  Yeah.  If you come down and need a sheep eye, I can...  I'll get you a ticket for my...  Yeah.  I think it's sold out, but I'll get you a ticket. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  We will guarantee you tickets to Norton's show when he hits Avalon in Boston if you come  down and do this for us.  All right.  But then you've got to come down again for the actual challenge.  Yeah, I'll be able to make it down then because hopefully...  I just applied at Foxy Lady.  Yeah.  To be a waitress at the strip club.  A waitress at the strip club.  I just went there today.  That means you weren't good enough for the stage.  No, I don't want to do it yet.  Where's Foxy Lady?  I'm sorry?  Is that Rhode Island or is that...  No, it's the one in Brockton.  It's new.  Brockton? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Brockton.  I live right near Brockton.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  And this is something I've noticed from the waitresses that don't dance at the strip club.  I have a big ass.  I was just going to ask you that.  Do you have a...  I have nice boobs, but I have a big ass.  How big is it?  There's always the girl that serves the booze at the strip club that has the stockings on,  the short skirt, and it's usually a big ass.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's...  It's so nice, but...  Holy ass.  Do you want the ride of death from Boston to New York?  Yeah, I do.  All right, hold on.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  Psycho Tim.  Yeah, if you just ride with me, would I get her in the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Are you hammered right now?  No, not yet.  I mean, Tim.  Hey, Tim.  It's so early in the day.  What is it?  What is the 55-gallon challenge?  Uh, we put girls in big, huge drums, and then we...  No, no, when is it?  Oh, when is it?  I don't know yet.  We got to get the...  We don't even have contestants yet.  Becky needs a ride down from Boston, and, uh...  No problem.  You'll drive her tomorrow?  Not tomorrow.  Well, we need her here tomorrow. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, we got to...  Are you here tomorrow to do the...  Oh, to eat the sheep eyes?  I got to find the sheep eyes tomorrow.  Yeah, well, we can find it if you don't.  Okay.  Who's going to drive her down here?  Ricardo Montalblonde?  Him and his chloroform with the lawyers?  Well, I'm not saying come across.  He's going to come across all the way over here.  Is it not Montalblonde?  How do you say it?  Montalbond.  Montalbond.  Montalbond.  Montalbond.  I would have said that.  I always thought it was Montalblonde. 
[01:49:00]  Montalblonde.  I really thought that was his name.  Rich Corinthian land.  Tim, you can't give her a ride tomorrow?  Not tomorrow I can't, but I can do it for the challenge.  Oh, for the challenge, he'll bring you down, Beck.  Okay, cool.  All right.  Thanks, man.  First of all, is she hot?  She's going to be a waitress that were on the strip club.  Hey, Rick's very concerned, Becky.  Can your fat ass fit in a 55-gallon drum?  Oh, definitely.  All right.  I'm not that big.  It's not like the big fat girl we needed the...  No, no, no.  ...pale score.  The big green one is Christy.  Yeah, I heard about that.  Are you coming tomorrow, ma'am? 
[01:49:30]  If I can get down there.  Okay, look, we've got to get a choo-choo.  We've got to get the choo-choo.  Runs right down.  Yeah, I think it's cheaper for the bus.  It's only like 30 bucks you're out there.  The Peter Pan will throw on a bus.  Oh, you rock.  This chick rocks.  She'll just come down on a bus.  Good girl.  All right, gentlemen.  All right, Tim.  We're going to let you go.  Bye, Tim.  Later.  All right, Becky, we need you.  Okay.  It's obvious that you're perfect for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah.  We usually don't find girls like this in a fine hamlet of Brockton.  There's not many girls up here who've got a face and not me. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  We understand.  Yeah, we understand.  All right, Becky, hold on.  All right, thanks.  Rick, make it happen.  Work your magic.  We need Becky eating chocolate-covered sheep eyes to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  And we need it to happen tomorrow.  Absolutely.  That's what usually happens with our show, Ant.  We need one girl or one guy, depending on the contest, to kind of break the ice.  And then they come out of the woodwork.  Yeah.  Like, oh, okay, that didn't sound too bad.  Exactly.  That's something that I'll do.  It's like when you go to the dance and nobody's dancing. 
[01:50:30]  Once that first couple gets up and starts dancing.  Everyone's dancing.  Next thing you know, everyone's dancing.  Right.  All right, let's go to Lori.  Lori, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I just heard you guys were pretty desperate, so I decided to take a call.  Very desperate.  Yeah.  Are you from New York?  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you want to try out?  Sure, but since I just heard, I didn't really think of anything.  I didn't really think of anything to do.  Well, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  I know.  We've got to be more lenient, though. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, boy.  We've got to be more lenient with things like this.  I just thought, you know, I could help you guys out.  Well, we had another girl that was going to come down here and drink bong water.  Another girl that blew us off.  I'll do that.  Lady, seriously, just remember this.  If you say you're going to do something for the show, we're counting on you.  We don't do the fake radio, so don't say that you'll do something outrageous because  it sounds great on the radio and then blow us off.  You know, be honest with us.  I mean, it'd be hella nasty, but I'd do it.  You would do the bong water?  Yeah.  That'd be funny.  All right.  Can we supply the bong water? 
[01:51:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know if I have any laying around.  You got a friend?  I don't like the bong water thing.  The bong water thing is disgusting.  Yeah, but I don't know.  Are you saying the drug use it implies?  No, I'm fine with that.  It's just not sick enough or crazy enough.  It's, you know, it's pretty disgusting to drink bong water, but it's not like doing  the golden thing on yourself.  And if a girl chugs bong water in front of you, you'll get nauseous. 
[01:52:00]  Have you ever had a little slippage and a little bong water happen?  Yeah.  It's pretty disgusting.  Not good.  It's not good.  It's not good, but I don't know.  That'd be something a little hotter, a little more daring physically, body-wise, something.  I don't know.  You guys are crazy.  Chugging bong water is pretty insane.  I happen to agree with Greg on this one.  Yeah?  Chugging bong water is crazy.  She's not going to like just a little sip?  I'll chug it.  She'll chug, ugh, just thinking about it. 
[01:52:30]  Should we go to the phones?  I guarantee every guy out there will say, yeah, this is twisted.  Some stoners do this just for the hell of it.  Dude, I'll do it.  I don't.  No, you don't, huh?  No.  Hold on a line.  We're desperate, Aunt.  You know, she tries out.  If it's not impressive, then you could lay your fist down.  I don't know.  You could do something that could raise welts on her.  Carrie, what's going on?  Hi, Ellen A.  Hi.  Hi, Jimmy Norton.  Hello, ma'am.  I'm from Philly, and I'm a super cute rocker chick, and I can get my whole body into the 
[01:53:00]  shape of a pretzel.  Really?  Oh, can you?  Yes.  I do lots of yoga.  Would you like something that's white and looks like mustard sprayed all over it?  If you feel like it, Jimmy.  What do you think of the pretzel thing, Aunt?  If she does it very scantily clad, if clad at all.  Scantily.  What is scantily considered for you?  Um...  Bra panties.  Lingerie.  Lingerie.  She's going to twist herself into a pretzel. 
[01:53:30]  Nice.  I can't believe you're even thinking about it.  No, I'm thinking about it, but I'm...  Between bomb water and a girl twisting into a pretzel?  I understand.  You're leaning toward pretzel, girl?  No, that's why I didn't give an answer.  How about both, guys?  There's room for everyone.  Yeah.  Look at us being picky, too.  We should just say, come on down, you're in.  We should just have an open tryout tomorrow and Friday.  Hey, girls, just show up.  Just show up, please.  Because now everyone's calling in.  I'm interested, but none of these girls have anything in mind. 
[01:54:00]  If you have something in mind that you want to do to get into the 55-gallon drum challenge,  call us up and say you're coming down tomorrow to do it.  Tomorrow or Friday, okay?  Yeah.  Do you guys pay for my train ticket?  Hell no, not for pretzel, girl.  You guys suck.  From Philly, huh?  I'm super cute.  We love cute girls.  Why can't we get people to pay for the goddamn tickets?  Yeah.  Well, not for pretzel, girl.  Why?  It has to be a little more outrageous before we...  Are you really attractive, pretzel, girl? 
[01:54:30]  Super attractive.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No.  I'll pay.  I know it'll pay you fair.  All right, hold on, Karen.  All right, what are we going to do?  Because now everyone's calling, they're interested, but they don't have any...  Look, another one, Megan from Boston.  Megan!  Hey!  Hi.  What's up?  I just woke up, you guys, where I was...  You know, my radio was my alarm clock.  I hear some crazy contests going on.  You need cute girls to do.  Some 55-gallon drum thing?  Yeah.  All right, I'm cute.  I'm a little wild. 
[01:55:00]  All right, do you know what we're looking for right now?  You're looking for someone to do something crazy for it.  Uh, just to qualify, to get into the drum, yeah.  To qualify.  All right, well, I'm super flexible.  Yeah.  See, this is going nowhere.  Hold on, Megan.  We need something.  These girls gotta realize they gotta do something that's really gonna make us go,  wow, oh, Jesus, look at that.  The girl, if she shows up tomorrow and eats the sheep eyes, dipped in chocolate.  Dipped in chocolate. 
[01:55:30]  Very good, you're in.  Very good.  Girl from Cleveland, she might drive eight hours, come here on Monday to do the handstand  yellow discipline thing.  Yeah.  Very good.  She will be in the contest.  That's good.  If she shows up and does that, okay?  Yep.  Uh, Chloe, what's this challenge about?  Uh, wife has some questions about 55-gallon drum challenge.  Interesting 55-gallon drum challenge doesn't know what to do.  Ah.  Someone's gonna have to screen these calls and blow off the ones that have no clue and,  uh, and get the ones that, uh, might have something interesting. 
[01:56:00]  And then we'll put them on the air.  How's that?  We had better end up with girls.  Because all these phone lines are now, uh, ladies trying to get in on the 55-gallon drum challenge.  I tell you, though, we had better end up with girls.  It's gonna be really sad if we blow off these girls and we end up, we can't do it.  We got no girls.  All right, uh, we'll take a break.  Dice is on the line.  We'll talk to him next.  Also, uh, uh, whoever's screening the calls, let's see what these ladies got.  They gotta try to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  But the ones on hold that are, are good, okay?  And we'll talk to them as well.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:56:30]  Oh my God, what is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Quiet.  Ooh, who you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  A lot's going on. 
[01:57:00]  A lot of ladies calling up.  They're going to try to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We're going to hold an open audition tomorrow and Friday on the show.  You call up Stinky right now and tell him what would you do to try to get in the 55-gallon  drum challenge.  If he thinks you're worthy enough, he'll invite you down to the station.  Simple as that, all right?  Right. 
[01:57:30]  Stacey.  Hello.  What's up, Andrew?  Andrew.  Dice.  Clay.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey.  I was thinking.  Yeah?  I came up with this thing.  Yeah?  You're not going to believe this.  What thing?  You know what I'm talking about when I said that, right?  No.  What thing?  What thing?  Yeah.  You know, like you've been watching the Olympics at all?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Now picture me.  Because I was watching them the other night.  Did you see them falling all over these little things on the ice there? 
[01:58:00]  Why?  Picture like a dice on ice.  Why?  Bring it right into New York.  Because I would know how to win something like that.  You know what I mean?  Well, why would you bring up dice on ice out of nowhere?  Because you don't understand how I think.  You know what I mean?  Because I'm back where I was.  I'm a, I'm a, yeah.  You don't know how I could.  Because I'm watching these little idiots spin around last night, right?  Right.  You know what I mean?  That Heather Marie with Christy Brinkley.  She fell on a race, right?  Right, right.  And when I do it, right? 
[01:58:30]  And I'm going to do it like I'm colored.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Because you know how to, they're good with sports, right?  Right.  You don't put, like, chinks and white people out on the ice.  They don't know what they're doing.  You're going to put me, the colored dice.  I'm going to be, you know, instead of, like, you know how, like, Puff Daddy changed his name?  Yeah.  I'm going to be, like, D-Cutty.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  And what are you going to do?  D-Cutty.  What are you going to do, though?  You want to know?  I go around, right?  I do my little routine, a couple figure eights like they do. 
[01:59:00]  And then, the best part is when I go in front of the judges and I do that big split where  I'm holding, like, my fingers between my legs.  Yeah.  Right?  And let me tell you what I do.  I take all my tummy tapioca, right?  And I just sprayed them with a frickin' face full of ball butter right in the face.  You know what that does to girl judges?  Start creaming in their frickin' jeans.  Is this what it was like to listen to it, O.P.?  You know what I mean? 
[01:59:30]  Why would you bring up Dice on Ice out of nowhere?  No.  It's D-Clean.  D-Clean.  All right.  Let's say the right name here.  Are you going to be doing the dice capades, too?  Let me explain something.  Yeah.  I do things the way men did things years ago, when men did things the way men were  when they were dinosaurs.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  I hear you.  Hey, Dice, we got a little background music for you as you try out the Dice on Ice Day.  Yeah.  So, I start out, right?  Yeah.  I put on the colored suit. 
[02:00:00]  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I put on the colored suit and I put on the music there, right?  Yeah.  And I start, like, pinching my helmet before I move.  You know, to puff out a little.  Uh-huh.  You know how they do that?  Yeah.  They get the banana nice and puffed out.  You know what I mean?  I mean, what real human being wants to stand on the ice and go, look at me, Pop, freaking  Sissy Mary's.  Right.  When I come out there real macho, I wear the leather jacket, maybe I draw on the tutu.  Right? 
[02:00:30]  Because I'm going to have to do the spread legs thing.  Right.  And I yank on the butter bag a little.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  As I'm going in front of the judges.  Oh, look what I'm going to you.  That I'm seeing their heads.  Because let me tell you something about my tapioca.  Yes, yes.  Hitting on the belly.  Yeah.  It's so thick and bubbly that after one of those slobs swallow like a bag of it.  Right.  They don't got to eat for three days.  That's how good I am.  Well.  52 full ounces.  I'm amazed.  So I do like the pool, right?  Right?  And then I break a board.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  See, nobody does any karate during that routine.  Oh, you're going to throw karate in.  I'm going to break a freaking board, right?  Well, that's something new, Dice.  What?  Uh-oh.  Look at you go now.  Oh, now the music's fast.  I'm moving, right?  Now the music's fast, Dice.  And then I do the flips on the hurdle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  This is how I work it.  How about midgets?  What?  Midgets?  Yeah, you bring some midgets with me.  I put midgets on my freaking feet.  I use them as skates.  These little insignificant animals, right? 
[02:01:30]  Because nobody's even going to talk to them and go, what a brilliant man.  What a brilliant man.  He's not even using skates.  He's using these unhuman things to skate around the ice.  You know what I mean?  I know exactly what you use to ice.  What about them?  Hey, are you going to be attempting that triple plow, Cal?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And then I have, like, to drive out.  I do something cool.  Yeah.  I have, like, a chink and a chap drive in, like, in a train's air. 
[02:02:00]  The gook's a hazard, right?  And I get in the car and I roll around the ice skating rink and I wave to everybody.  Maybe squeeze a couple girls, you know, big fat, them things on the top of their boobs,  whatever them are.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  When I shake hands with some people, maybe I take it out and I go, look at this.  Look at how hard I could get in front of everybody.  I don't got no problem like that.  I'm good like that.  All right.  You know what I mean?  Maybe a couple girls. 
[02:02:30]  Maybe I'm playing some girls right in the front row and I'm going around and doing a couple  spins and they bend over and I go, spread your cheek, slob.  There you go, head the marine.  There you go, head the marine.  Because I do things the old way.  Right.  When men were dinosaurs.  Hey, look at you.  I hear me.  Look at you with the goofy music now.  Christy Brinkley thinks she's something when she's out there.  What is she going to do?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  She should have stuck with Billy.  That's what she should have done. 
[02:03:00]  That dummy.  She's out on the ice flying all over.  They don't even know to stick a couple fingers in there to entertain people.  That's how dumb he is.  Well done.  I'll tell you that right now.  I would definitely pay to see that.  So, wouldn't you pay to see that?  To see you skating like that.  And it's something I haven't heard of yet.  Yeah.  Where'd you get this dice on ice idea?  I don't know.  It came to me like golf and ice.  Like when Norton was talking.  You know what I mean?  I hear you. 
[02:03:30]  You know what you should do?  You've got to do dice on ice.  Is Norton there?  Oh, yeah.  I'm right there.  Yeah, you know what?  But before I even get into anything, Norton.  Yes.  I've got to tell you.  You guys should be very proud of Norton, you know.  We are.  No, but do you know what he's doing in concert, this guy?  He's doing shows.  He's doing unbelievable.  I'm very proud of him.  Oh, yeah.  He's becoming a huge star now.  I'm very proud of him.  He does songs and antics.  He's nervous about it, but you know what?  He's the freaking best. 
[02:04:00]  I tell you that right now.  We know he's a little nervous.  I don't know why.  He's dripping fluid all over the states already.  All these tickets are very hot, and they're selling like crazy, and the guy's walking around  like he's a bitch on the rag.  He's freaking out.  He's freaking out.  He's got Town Hall on sale.  I even want to come.  You know, Norton won't work with me anymore.  He's too big for that.  Well, Town Hall is what?  April 18th here in New York.  Yeah.  Tickets are on fashion.  You guys are bringing me in, right?  I'm supposed to be somewhere.  At the Ice Capades. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, stupid.  You're going to be at the Garden again.  Don't you remember what you said you were supposed to say?  You're going to skate.  Let me tell you something, Donnie.  Let me tell you something.  Nicky was a rat because Sonny Black said Nicky was a rat.  You could have got wrapped out just for that thing in Florida, just for your information.  Right.  Did you see what I did right there?  I saw that there.  No, did you see?  You didn't even get what I did.  I saw that there.  You know the clowns that call in?  It's not a lie.  They go, oh, let me do an impression now. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Let me do an impression.  Me?  I'm so brilliant in my own, like, way there.  I go right into it, and then, like, I forget it.  Let me hear that again.  Who?  The one you were doing.  I forget what I just did.  We didn't really hear all that because you...  Let me tell you something.  You surprised us with it.  I like you more even than I liked you the other times.  You're going to do it all day, Dice?  No, no, I did a different one.  That was Madsen.  See, you don't even get who I'm doing.  It's not even worth doing these impressions. 
[02:05:30]  Dice, a lot of people excited that you called us today.  Some guy named...  Do you know a guy named Frenchy?  Do I know a guy?  No.  He wants to say hi to you.  Okay.  Who should I be?  Just talking.  He's a big fan of you.  Frenchy.  Frenchy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Dice.  You fatty, tiny, gritty, gritty bastard.  Hey, my friend.  What are you doing?  I am over here now.  Where are you, eh?  Hey, because you said everybody...  You faggot, eh?  You're weak. 
[02:06:00]  You're my figure-spitting.  Oh.  Hey, you're weak.  We're weak.  Nicey.  Why, he says nice.  Nicey, nice.  I'm over here now.  Oh.  No, no, no.  You ain't no way in today.  Yeah, banana juice all over you.  You ain't no way in today.  I do flips over your ass, you dumb butt-passed.  It's full of friggin' mango pudding.  And then we're dead.  I don't know.  Hey, what's happening?  You're having a heart attack again?  I don't know.  I'm over here doing this, that, and the other thing with everybody saying like that. 
[02:06:30]  Bop!  You know what I mean?  What are you doing?  You're having a heart attack.  Look what I did to you.  No, no, no, no.  I'm having...  I'm having a banana juice attack.  No, it's mine.  Oh, look what he's doing to me now.  I'm Pinch the Helmet, Pinch the Helmet, Pinch the Helmet.  I'm over here now.  Stop, stop, stop.  You fuck, you fuck. 
[02:07:00]  It's like a faggot.  How you about it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jam bag of all you ass.  What are you saying to me now?  Why don't you die, old Eddie?  Oh, you know, I got that to Gino.  Yeah?  Huh?  Up your way, you dumb, you sparse.  Come on.  Where are you, in Los Angeles?  Come on now, Frenchy.  Huh?  You in the West?  Come on, you're Frenchy.  Why don't you kill yourself, you dumb ass?  Pinch the Helmet, Pinch the Helmet, Pinch the Helmet, Pinch the Helmet.  Huh?  You old bastard?  I've been funny since 86. 
[02:07:30]  Oh!  Uh, here.  You carry his in the dump in South Island.  Maybe you're crazy.  You dumb, fat bastard.  Why are you getting so mad?  Never, never.  Oh!  You know, I say to you, I'm over here now.  I'm over here because you're over there.  You know what I'm saying?  No, I'm over here because you said I'm over here now, because you're back where you was.  I scratch my yam bag and you collect the rest. 
[02:08:00]  No, I don't scratch my yam bag.  You stupid ass.  We have a yam bag party.  Dice, you're a big, fat old bastard and you carry it in the pain.  I look a lot like your mummy.  Yeah, and she can suck it all day, you bitch.  No, you tried to insult me.  Zero in the game of life.  That's the way you are.  You dumb F.  Oh, why you get so mad?  Go back to cleaning the toilet.  Never.  Never get mad over an old bastard like you.  Oh, I see you, sorry.  I don't mind you. 
[02:08:30]  All right, all right.  All right, Frenchy.  Wow, that Frenchy guy.  Jeez.  All right.  Sorry, Dice, you said...  What are we talking about?  You said he was a big fan of yours.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, we got out to a bad start again.  I think so.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Hey, Dice, you know what I rented the other night?  One night at McCool's.  Hey.  Very funny Dice performance in that.  Did you see that yet?  Oh, you're renting yet?  No.  Got to rent it.  What are you talking about?  It's very, very funny.  I like the dice, the angry Dice with the gun and everything. 
[02:09:00]  And then he goes, oh, look at you.  You're the big guy now by the safe.  And he goes over to the other side and goes, look, okay, now I'm over here now.  I stand over here now.  Very funny.  I did that for you.  That's what you told me to do in the movie.  It was very, very funny.  If you get a chance, I would rent that.  Not you, Dice.  I'm talking to the people.  You've probably seen it.  Hell, it's no brain smasher.  Oh.  That was back then.  When men did things as a dinosaur. 
[02:09:30]  You hear it?  I hear me.  You hear it?  I hear me.  And then I get a rare salty act up.  You hear it?  And then I take my tongue.  End of date, honey.  Very good, Dice.  You know what I mean?  So I'm going to be coming in there.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  Huh?  When are you coming to town, Dice, man?  The beacon.  We're going to do the beacon again.  Oh, yeah?  Huh?  Yeah, you know. 
[02:10:00]  You're supposed to say it.  Don't you remember?  We're waiting to sell more tickets for Jimmy Norton.  Are you really?  Jimmy's doing great.  He's getting there.  Yeah, no.  Jimmy, I got to tell you.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  What did he blow out?  Like 16 shows in Philly alone?  I got three.  Three.  16.  Three is a big deal.  But you just did three, right?  I did two.  He's going into Cleveland.  He's going into Boston.  He's going into Brazil where the gas is at three inches higher.  Was it the equator? 
[02:10:30]  Did you know that?  No, I never knew that.  You ever researched that kid?  No.  You've got to get on your, like, what's that thing where they show the pictures?  What?  The internet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't get involved with those things.  Yeah.  Like on that TV thing you got there?  It's the 21st century.  You're not on the computer?  I do comedy.  I'm not into that.  You know what I mean?  Well, let's talk about that.  You want to get chicks from Brazil to send in their asses.  They're actually higher because the equator keeps them up there. 
[02:11:00]  How is that?  It opens them up a little.  Yeah?  Because you're spinning earth?  Right?  Because the way the earth is spinning?  Yeah!  Oh, okay.  Now I understand.  When you put your nose out of there, you got two nostrils full of salt pudding.  You know what I mean?  What's better than that?  What's a better Friday night than that?  Nothing.  Nothing better.  Yeah.  So when am I at the beacon?  Because I was told to call it.  I didn't even know I'm coming in.  Dice?  Honestly, I don't have the...  When's Dice at the beacon?  I don't have the date in front of me. 
[02:11:30]  I'm not...  Well, it goes on sale.  What did we sell out last time?  In 35 minutes?  Yeah.  Oh, very quickly.  I don't have the date in front of me and I'm not even trying to make a gag.  What is it?  It's in April.  It goes on sale Saturday.  Oh, okay.  It's in April.  Saturday.  I want a 20-minute sellout this time, guys.  There you go.  Very cool.  20 minutes.  That's what I call.  All right.  Saturday.  Saturday.  It goes on sale Saturday, the beacon.  But forget that for now.  Let's talk more about the dice-capades.  No.  Do you have any ideas?  Well, I had a couple, but nothing I would ever say. 
[02:12:00]  No, I understand.  I know how you are.  Yeah, I wouldn't do that.  I know how you are, ain't it?  No, I'm not going to step on your toes, Dice.  Yeah, we wouldn't...  No, that's not you.  That's not your style.  No, we wouldn't do the Dice on Ice thing.  No.  We wouldn't do something like...  It's different than that.  No.  Dice on Ice and come out with ideas of what Dice would be like skating.  This is why I called in, Norton said, you should do something like on Dice on Ice.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Because, like, the Olympics are like, they're doing that this week.  But I always watch the Olympics.  I miss that stuff.  When they flip around, you ever see the chicks flip around on that wooden stick?  When they do that? 
[02:12:30]  And one of them always misses, and she hits her beef pocket right on the stick.  And it gets all swollen like a truck steak.  A beef pocket.  You know that the crossing guards there, the guys that give it a mark, are going, that's  a winner.  That's a winner.  That's the uneven bars.  A beef pocket could take a beating.  It's gold medal, that pocket.  That's the Summer Olympics, Dice.  Right.  That's the Summer Olympics.  That's the Summer Olympics.  You know what?  I've been wondering why they didn't do the stick. 
[02:13:00]  We're into the uneven bars.  We're into the Winter Olympics with the curling and the snowboarding.  Don't they got an inside where they could do some of the flips?  Well, how about like the bobsledding or the luge?  Yeah.  No, I saw that girl.  She's a real slob.  That luge.  You see that Russian last night with a face like a parrot?  Parrot?  Yeah.  You ever seen them parrots?  What, the bird?  No, not the bird.  It's like a squirrel, but it's a parrot. 
[02:13:30]  It looks like you're a ferret.  Oh, I thought you meant a parrot.  It's a ferret.  Wait, I just got a piece of candy.  I've got a Red Hot here.  Red Hot.  Oh.  Morton likes when I eat Red Hot.  Uh-huh.  Hey, Dice, we've got to take a break.  Okay.  We've got to go.  Okay, tickets on sale for the Beacon on Saturday.  Saturday.  That's right.  It's April 26th at the Beacon Theater.  Are you guys doing anything there?  No, I think I'm going to...  You know, Anthony.  That's my birthday, Dice.  Anthony.  I'm going to be in Mexico.  I've got a great idea. 
[02:14:00]  What?  You come on with me.  Yeah?  And we do like, you know how sometimes you do like a parody of me?  I haven't done that in a long time.  No, I know, but we both do like the Dice on Ice.  We wear like the midgets on our feet.  And the two twos?  You know what I mean?  We knock them out or something for a few minutes.  You throw me, I throw you.  Yeah, and we do like a...  And then I hold you up like over my head.  And your bananas start swinging like a freaking pendulum in front of the judges.  And I say like this.  Look what he's doing now. 
[02:14:30]  You know what I mean?  Right.  What do you think of, stupid?  That sounds good.  Okay, I'm in.  All right, look.  We got to go.  We got to go.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  We're very late, Dice.  Hey, take a break.  Do whatever you got to do with what you got, because I'm over here doing this now.  All right.  It's what I do.  It's all I do.  All right.  When men were...  Hey, Norton.  Yes.  Call me later.  I got to tell you something about that thing that you said something.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  See you, man.  There he goes, Dice. 
[02:15:00]  Andrew Dice Clay.  Billed as Andrew Silverstein on One Night at McCool's.  Wasn't his choice.  Really?  No, of course.  A bunch of stupid studio people.  They didn't want to...  He doesn't care.  It's him.  He never does him.  Yeah.  But, you know, well, you don't want to put dice because you might get protests.  Meanwhile, Michael Douglas was out banging everything and cheating on his wife.  Yeah.  Andrew's a faithful husband, but you can't have him.  It just really bugs me.  Stupid feminists.  Rape is hilarious.  And then he hit me.  Did he really? 
[02:15:30]  What is wrong with you?  Wow.  Feminist sees I hate them.  Finley.  Yeah.  What's up, Finley?  That is gross.  Anthony, the ultimate line of the day.  Why?  When Dice Man said, I don't get involved in that internet stuff.  I get into comedy.  And you said, okay, let's hear some of that.  Oh, see, I didn't say that.  That was Opie.  That was Opie.  Yeah.  Finley.  Opie said that.  Finley.  Finley.  Finley, let me tell you something.  I only get one good line a day. 
[02:16:00]  I'm sorry.  Let's keep track.  I apologize.  It sounded like Anthony.  It has many funny lines.  Jim, it has many funny lines.  I get one.  I do?  Not today.  Not today.  Learn the characters.  Jerk off face.  All right.  Thank you, Finley.  You know what really does?  You got it, guys.  The Dice on Ice thing, though.  Wow.  That was great.  I didn't spill the beans, either.  Oh, really?  I would have told him.  It was hilarious.  Well, he loved it.  Obviously, somebody told him.  Dice on Ice.  You know, then, when Anthony did Dice on Ice originally last week, we got so much email 
[02:16:30]  from all over the country thinking that it was really Dice doing that.  People thought it was Dice, yeah.  People actually think it's Dice.  And now they're really confused because then Dice calls up and does Dice on Ice a little  bit.  When we first started here in New York, and I would do the Dice voice, people thought Dice  was in the studio all the time.  And we had him as the guy that used to clean up and take the garbage out.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, here comes Dice.  You remember Andrew Dice Clay?  Well, he's working here now, and he's cleaning up.  And he'd come in and, where are the garbage pails? 
[02:17:00]  I clean up the garbage, and I sweep now.  And people actually called up and would talk to Dice.  That's hilarious.  My first time hearing about you guys, I was obviously working with Andrew, and Club Soda  Kenny called me.  There's two guys in New York that do an impression of Andrew.  Andrew.  I was really prepared to hate you.  And I'm going to beat you.  Oh, real?  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, because you're my friend, man.  I'm like, you guys are torn on my friend.  I'm not going to like them.  And then the first time I listened to the show, you're doing Tyson and Empire State  Building references.  I'm like, oh, this is great. 
[02:17:30]  That's what won you over.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  All right on.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, I just want to tell Rick, isolate that whole phone call.  Yeah, right.  Every time Dice calls, it's like a whole new soundboard.  Yeah.  All right.  Peace out.  All right.  An-man-ma.  An-man-ma.  An-man-ma.  An-man-ma.  Oh, and I got to play something for you.  What do you got?  It'll just make you maybe gag.  Gag?  Gag.  I don't think I want to gag.  I don't know which one is the best. 
[02:18:00]  I know the movie kind of sucked, One Night at McCool's, but Dice was funny in it.  Very funny.  This is for you, Ed.  Okay.  Here's a song you're not going to find anywhere else.  Except on one of the other 800 stations owned by Love Media, our sister stations.  Rock and roll!  It's Head Radio.  Yeah.  How many times have you heard this song playing Grand Theft Auto 3?  Driving through the streets of Portland in the rain with this playing? 
[02:18:30]  Yes, I rarely get in this car, though.  I really didn't.  Usually it was the chick and the...  Oh, do we have the Yippie-A-O?  That's the big one.  Maybe it's this one?  Yeah, pop it in.  That's like the one I hear all the time.  You're tuned to Lips.  Oi, I tell ya.  Don't touch that radio.  No, this one too, though. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, she's got this one.  In a black car, I make voice.  I like what you got in the Spanish gang's cars.  And all the techno music is playing.  It lets you get higher.  Feel it.  It takes you away.  All right.  You got another one?  Yeah.  Is that it?  Here's one that brings down the house when I do my weekly Michael Hunt's Rock and Ball Jam  at Liberty City's Carly Alley.  I'm Mike, Wheels of Steel Hunt. 
[02:19:30]  I know she sounds kind of crude, but she feels kind of good.  She sings a hit.  Yeah.  We got to get the yip, yip, and the yip.  Yeah.  Yeah, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.  All right.  We're going to break it.  And I'm on fire.  Oh, she's on fire.  Oh, she's on...  That's from a porno movie.  Is it?  That's from Taboo 2, directed by Freddie Stevens.  She's on fire.  Yeah, it's phenomenal.  While he's banging his sister.  And it's 6.05.  Oh.  It is.  Yeah, I just want to say it's 6.05.  A little time shout-out? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, a little time shout-out.  It might mean something to someone out there.  O.B. Anthony.  W.N.E.W.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  Just wait till the spring.  Springtime.  Wow will pop all over the place once again.  But it's still happening, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  There's a lot of people out there.  They put wow on the back of their rides.  Whether it's the bumper sticker or a homemade wow sign. 
[02:20:30]  Or they ride it in the dirt.  And, ladies, that basically means that guy wants to see your lovely boobs as they're driving home from work.  Yeah.  Simple, simple concept.  Yeah.  We love it.  And when spring hits, we'll really focus on wow, all right?  Oh, yeah.  I'd like to gut with a fishing knife, making $65 million and bitching about having to go to bed and get up for the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, the hour's a little rough.  Yeah, a little rough on you, Katie.  $65 million to do nothing but be a relatively attractive, broad sidekick. 
[02:21:00]  Well, she's not attractive anymore.  Whatever she is.  She used to be what they call perky back in the day.  That was a perky or perky sidekick.  She looks like a clown now.  Looks like she has, like, clown makeup on.  Let me see her picture over there on the Daily News.  No one really pissed me off in today's paper that our mayor here in New York.  Mayor Bloomberg.  Bloomberg.  He's taking vacations.  Already.  There are guys that haven't left ground zero since September 11th.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  They are still out there digging on their hands and knees for their fellow firemen and policemen and EMT workers and everyone else that perished down there on 9-11.  And our mayor feels like, ah, it's time for a vacation.  Well, he's a little taxed, maybe.  He needs a little rest.  He came back all tan.  And the press here in New York has gone nuts.  And they're trying to get some answers.  Yeah.  Because he owns, like, you know, mansions all over the goddamn place.  The guy's very rich. 
[02:22:00]  And they're trying to figure out where he was for three days.  He comes back all nice and tan and rested.  Well, it's the same brain surgeon that wants to put tolls on the East River crossings, which here in New York City are free because everything on the west side is a toll.  So, I'm just, every time I drive on the FDR in the East Side of Manhattan, I look and go, where are you putting the toll booths?  Where are you putting the toll booths?  In the spaghetti of mess highway that is on the other side of those bridges. 
[02:22:30]  So, that's one great idea he's got.  The other great idea is he wants to put a huge city tax on cigarettes, which, oh, sounds great.  Hey, tax the smokers.  Unless Jersey and Connecticut and Pennsylvania and everyone else files suit, you're going to be seeing the biggest organized crime renaissance in the form of illegal cigarettes coming into the city ever.  However, if you're able to make a couple of bucks per pack of cigarettes just by crossing one bridge, going through one tunnel, who's not going to take that? 
[02:23:00]  The guy's an idiot.  Dude, he's not, don't forget, he's not, he's the most conservative, but he was a liberal who switched.  And, I mean, your choices were abominable.  It was either him or Mark Green or Freddie.  Mark Green.  For our.  But the term limits, you can't have Giuliani, the only guy who was qualified for the job.  Hey, and believe me, he wanted to stay.  Yeah, and this scumbag is taking vacations. 
[02:23:30]  That's good.  Giuliani wasn't taking any vacations.  No, of course he wasn't.  You know what Bloomberg should have done?  He should have got his ass down to ground zero and gave a few of those guys, like, a free vacation.  Well, why would you do that?  They've been there forever, and this guy's tanning himself?  Giuliani had prostate cancer.  He didn't go anywhere.  Right, I don't think, I don't think the city is completely healed where you, the mayor, should be going off on three-day little vacations.  Well, you know, it was the biggest abomination that this guy's pulled so far.  I'm pissed that people think that everything is back to normal. 
[02:24:00]  Groundhog Day, remember that?  Yeah.  The picture in the paper, it showed a funeral of a firefighter.  Had the firefighter's young son standing in front of the mother holding his father's helmet, his fire helmet.  But in the split picture on the other side of the paper was Mayor Bloomberg, instead of attending that very funeral, he had other things to do.  It was a picture of him holding the fluffy little groundhog that had just seen his little shadow coming out of the hole. 
[02:24:30]  The Staten Island groundhog.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  It's not even the one from PA.  Yeah.  Well, the Staten Island groundhog.  Yeah.  That's more important than going to the service.  That was more important than going to the service of a firefighter.  That's what Giuliani would have done, I'm sure.  He would have held the little groundhog.  Ah, yeah.  I was never the biggest fan of Giuliani.  No one was before September 11th.  Let's be straight here.  I was.  But he always did the...  He seemed to do the right thing after 9-11, that's for sure. 
[02:25:00]  Dude, he had you arrested.  You know what?  He completely had you arrested.  He personally had you arrested.  Personally had you arrested.  That really bugged me, and I still met him after that.  I still shook his hand.  I still got a picture taken with him.  You did?  Yeah, it's on my website.  I'm not even going to plug this site.  I love Giuliani.  See that picture at eatabullet.com.  Oh, you whore.  Well, with all your flubbing today, someone wrote,  Norton is flubbing so often, I hope he doesn't mess up his site and call it eataballet.com.  I stink.  That's Matt from Philly. 
[02:25:30]  Taking vacations.  Great.  Well, good job.  He's working very hard.  He deserves it.  Well-rested.  He's working real hard.  Regular Joe just has his office like everyone else's.  Have some dignity and act like the mayor.  What?  He's worked a solid month and a half?  Yeah.  Stop trying to be a regular guy, stupid.  Nobody wants a regular guy mayor.  Be the mayor.  Be the mayor and work.  A little elbow grease into it.  I'll roll up my shirt sleeves.  Fat liberal businessman creep.  Get right into work.  That whole cigarette thing, though, is hysterical. 
[02:26:00]  You will single-handedly turn New York City into the Old West again.  Again.  Like the Dinkins years.  Only worse.  There will be...  The mob will say,  Uh, thank God.  Thank God for this Bloomberg.  And there will be mafia trucks rolling.  Rolling.  Gunfire. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, a lot of favors going around.  Yeah.  A lot of favors.  It's the dumbest thing.  You're trying to raise money.  And they should do tobacco companies, though, because it's nobody's choice to smoke.  You're forced to do it.  Yeah.  You know, as an adult or whatever, you don't pick up a cigarette and make that choice.  You know, someone holds a gun to your head and makes you...  Suckers.  Well, the writing wasn't big enough on the pack.  Oh, just...  I'm so tired.  There was a time there wasn't that warning, and people really thought it was healthy for  you.  And the 40s.  They don't think that anymore.  You know, we didn't... 
[02:27:00]  I like seeing people that are, like, in their 30s going,  We didn't know back when I stopped.  That might have worked back in the 20s when the flappers would be smoking out of the big  cigarette holders.  But a flat iron building.  Back then, you only lived to 52 anyway.  We just didn't know.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  What?  We had a syntax here in Cleveland, and basically paid for our new stadiums for football, you  know, and the Indians.  Yeah.  And they taxed beer and cigarettes, and, you know, people weren't running. 
[02:27:30]  It was just in the county here to Cleveland, and people weren't running for the borders  or importing cigarettes.  It's not going to happen.  And if you need a cigarette and you need a smoke, you know, you need that Jones.  You're going to go get it wherever.  Yeah, yeah.  The people that just buy them in the stores, that's fine.  But there is an element of organized crime that comes in and picks up the difference.  Buy low, sell high.  If I could buy low on this side of the bridge and sell high on this side, you don't think  that they're going to do it, Matt?  No, it didn't happen here. 
[02:28:00]  And it's not the average Joe that goes and buys the cigarettes in the store.  It's the guy that's supplying cigarettes to the store.  It's a lot higher up.  Matt, listen to Anthony.  He knows what he's talking about.  Hey.  Sometimes he does.  Not this time.  My family.  Anthony knows what he's talking about.  Hey, huh?  Hey, Norton, I got tickets to see you in Cleveland here, man.  Thank you, sir.  Looking forward to it.  I hope there's a second show on sale, too, so I hope you got the first show.  Thanks.  I got the first show.  All right.  Let's go to Sean.  Shawnee. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, listen.  Yeah.  Norton doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.  The whole goddamn thing with the groundhog and the fireman's funeral.  I didn't mention it.  I didn't mention it.  Who was that?  It doesn't matter.  It wasn't me.  All right.  Well, listen.  The whole deal was...  Oh, sir.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I won't do it again.  I'm sorry.  That's why we're giving you a chance here, my friend.  All right.  Go ahead.  The whole thing was...  And I'm not a big fan of Bloomberg, okay? 
[02:29:00]  I'm not a big fan because he hasn't done anything right now that has impressed me.  However, the day that that funeral was going off and they put the picture in the New York Post of the groundhog, him holding the groundhog,  and a devastatingly depressing picture of the kid holding his daddy's helmet, that funeral was three hours after that groundhog ceremony.  Did he attend that funeral? 
[02:29:30]  But he didn't because he went to his friend's funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  All right?  The guy just got into office.  What?  He's going to go to every frigging funeral?  All right?  I'm a damn detective in the city.  I worked in the morgue for five and a half weeks after the World Trade Center.  I sat there and I figure printed every goddamn cop and every goddamn fireman that came in there.  So don't sit there.  Everyone's crying about this and this.  It's nonsense.  It's nonsense.  All right. 
[02:30:00]  Well, there you go.  Well, you blame me, sir, and I didn't even bring it up.  Oh, I thought they said Norton.  I was driving.  I'm sorry, Norton.  I'm sorry.  I love you guys.  I think you guys are the best.  All right, Sean.  I'll tell you right now.  Give the guy a chance.  I don't know what he's done yet.  I don't really see him going to a lot of these services or anything yet.  Yeah, but he hasn't gone to the cops ones either.  Granted, there was a lot more firemen that died.  I see him going on vacation and coming back to it.  I don't think it's time to go on vacation yet.  I don't think the city is fully healed.  But, you know, are you going to give the guy a chance?  Are you going to say, like, oh, here's the New York Post. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, that's a great newspaper.  Well, you know something?  Here's a guy holding a goddamn groundhog and a kid holding a fire helmet.  And that funeral is three hours after that groundhog.  Well, you know something?  Listen, I don't think it's time to have the mayor doing wacky groundhog things either.  So regardless if it was...  He's the mayor of New York, and Giuliani did all those wacky things.  And every other mayor did those wacky things.  You know something?  I think he stopped doing the wacky things a while to do important things for the city.  And it's a groundhog in Staten Island.  No one cares about Staten Island's groundhog. 
[02:31:00]  Why are you going to attack the guy for...  I'm not defending him.  They care about the groundhog in PA, not Staten Island.  Everyone has to have their groundhog now.  But I'm not...  Like I said, I'm not defending him.  I could care less.  But you know what?  Why?  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  I haven't seen anything from the new mayor yet.  I'm waiting.  I'm sitting here waiting.  Neither have I, but give the guy a chance.  I haven't heard any really good speeches yet.  I'm not feeling it yet.  And prior to September 11th, you ask any cop or any fireman what they thought about Giuliani. 
[02:31:30]  They hated him.  And what are they going to tell you?  They were annoyed.  They didn't have any of them.  What are they going to tell you?  Sean, Sean, Sean.  I haven't got a goddamn raise in years.  Sean, Sean.  I've been down in that goddamn city for years.  I've been brushing my balls.  I haven't got a goddamn thing.  Sean, you're going to get us pissed because we have talked about that many, many times.  I know, yeah.  Since September 11th as well.  You stupid faggot.  Oh, me?  Oh, I'm a faggot.  Who's this?  I'm a faggot.  Take it easy, all right? 
[02:32:00]  You're on the phone.  Okay, that's funny.  My bad.  But you know what?  I've been down in for years, and I've been doing the same thing for years.  And I've been...  For years I've been down in.  Hey, Sean, we've heard this.  We have a lot of friends and family on the job.  I know you do.  On the job.  We understand.  I'm not some jack-off calling you.  You dumb dude.  I am a goddamn cop, and I've been down in for years.  All right.  All right, Sean.  All right?  And I still love you guys.  Mm-hmm.  When you guys say, all right?  Fuck it!  All right.  Yeah, okay.  Good for you. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, you know this.  Go on, if you know this show.  Jeez, yeah.  Come on, Sean.  I dream be until I pass out.  We're...  Sean?  What?  We're injecting a little humor, just to get it back on track.  I know you are.  Why don't you get up on the phone?  Take a breath.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  But you know what?  When you come out of there tonight, watch your back.  You bastard.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  There he goes.  I'm sorry.  We didn't mean to hang up there.  We didn't that time.  Carrie, what's up?  No, she's right here.  Hang on, man.  Oh, all right.  Why is Carrie calling?  Carrie, where are you calling from? 
[02:33:00]  I'm Columbus.  Columbus?  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  We haven't gotten a phone call from Columbus in months.  Are we still on the air in Columbus?  Yeah, every day.  Oh, good.  Good to hear.  What's up, Redneck?  They don't really participate in the show a lot from Columbus.  Well, because most people don't have phones.  It is, you know, cow town.  So, Carrie from Columbus, what do you want to do today?  Well, we have a special edition of the 6 o'clock queef for us today.  It's going to be a crime scene queef.  All right.  Crime scene queef. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  Hold on the line there.  Hold on.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Suck it.  Throw out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  You don't move.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tess up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  All right, Anthony.  It's Carrie from Columbus with the 6 o'clock crime scene queef.  All right.  All right.  Carrie?  Yeah.  Whenever you're ready. 
[02:34:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Come on.  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  That's it, dude.  She's making a mess.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  How are you guys doing? 
[02:34:30]  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  You're being hit, bitty.  Okay.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Hands up and let yourself roar.  Go away.  And there you have it.  All I kept thinking of is what it probably looked like with the time of the month.  It's like, you ever see a fan in the store with the string blowing?  Let them know it's on.  You ever make pudding on the stove and you get those bubbles that kind of like, 
[02:35:00]  they're just like big, thick bubbles that come to the surface through the pudding?  It's like a fart, but smells like fish and copper.  Stephanie, what's going on?  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, Stephanie.  What's up?  Nothing.  No one to call on.  I noticed I was in the top 20.  Stephanie, better known as contestant number 37.  In the Naughty Nighty contest.  Mm-hmm.  I wanted to call and thank everybody for voting for me to get in the top 20. 
[02:35:30]  From Washington, D.C., one of our finalists.  We're down to 20 girls in the contest.  You've got to go to opianthony.com and vote every single day.  We're going to announce the winner sometime Tuesday.  All right.  And, Steph, without giving too much away, you're doing quite fine.  You're doing good.  Oh, good.  In the voting so far.  Wonderful.  Your reshoot pictures were very nice.  Yeah, I wanted to add a few more, but they didn't put them up.  Oh.  Well, it's a little late now. 
[02:36:00]  Well, before the cutoff time.  Say that again?  Whoa.  It was before the cutoff time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now we're underwater.  Hold on.  Wow, that's cool.  Hey.  Hey.  I'm deep beneath the ocean's surface.  Hey, let's do an hour of radio like this.  This should be entertaining.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  We figured out what was wrong with the...  I'd smash it into your teeth.  What?  Nothing funny about making funny things with the microphone being turned a certain way. 
[02:36:30]  What?  I knew you were going to, you know, hey, let's make the voices like this and talk for a while.  It stinks.  I used to do that when I was like 12.  It's fun stuff.  Speed up your voice.  Let's surface and get through this all.  All right, Stephanie.  We're back to normal here.  Okay.  Hey.  Hey.  Are you getting recognized down in Washington?  No.  Not really.  Really?  Really?  Because you know how many people have checked out your pictures?  It's insane at this point.  Yeah.  Actually, I kept the screen name, so I've been responding back to the email. 
[02:37:00]  So, it's been fun.  That was fun last time we did that?  Yeah.  Where we had guys...  Are you online right now?  No, but I can be.  This is a cute little bit.  Everyone IMing her trying to get her phone number.  Yeah.  Give it to Tinkle Drinker.  I talked to somebody that said they talked to you online.  Do you get people online that...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Steph.  Well, thanks for checking in.  Oh, no problem.  And good luck to you. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, good luck with the rest of the voting.  When we eventually make it down to Washington, you're going to have to stop by and say hi to us.  Oh, I will.  Well, if I win, I'm sure I'll come down and talk to you guys.  I'll probably come and claim the prize and talk to you, if I do win.  If.  Is that yours?  The big if.  If.  If.  We did announce earlier that no one from Sacramento is leading the contest right now.  Really?  Wow, that's surprising.  Yes, isn't it?  It really is surprising, yeah.  No, it's not surprising. 
[02:38:00]  We got a theory.  I think Sacramento effed themselves.  Too many hot chicks.  It's just splitting the vote.  Splitting the vote.  They gave us four hot chicks, and now everyone in the Sacramento area, because we know a lot  of the cities, they're rooting for their hometown girls, four hot chicks to choose from.  So many cooks spoil the broth.  Yeah, I think it messed up their strategy a little bit.  Oh, wow.  So pretty much everyone's getting the equal amount of votes, but it was kind of.  Look at you.  Can't get anything past you.  Wow.  No, no.  Attractive, and she's got a brain.  Wow.  All right, Steph. 
[02:38:30]  Contestant number 37.  Thanks for checking in.  No problem.  Bring that thing.  What?  Huh?  He was trying to get her off the floor.  He got her.  Bring that thing.  I missed that one.  Yeah, don't worry.  Everyone else did, too, but we're finding it funny.  Oh, okay.  Stephanie, one other thing?  Sir, what?  Ah, that old gag.  One other thing.  Click.  Ho, ho, ho. 
[02:39:00]  Look at the top from Jersey, dude.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Tail from Jersey.  Bing, bing.  All right.  Well, sure.  That's nice.  Okay.  John, what's up?  No, not nothing.  They moved on to something else.  I knew a bunch of stuff about smuggling of the cigarettes.  Well, real fast.  No, I'm in the business.  I'm an import-exporter.  One of my biggest customers.  That's now all he does is smuggle cigarettes and booze because they have the highest taxes. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Sorry, sorry.  Watch that.  Watch the cursing thing.  I didn't realize I was on the phone with you guys.  Sorry.  That's all right.  Sorry, sorry.  Yeah, no, but, yeah, I work in the import-export of B.  Oh, we heard that, yeah.  And, um, but the guy switched.  No, but, uh, John from Canada.  We've got to take a break here, but, John, real fast.  Hello.  Go ahead, John. 
[02:40:00]  Well, I'm not from Canada.  I'm from Jamestown, New York, about 60 miles south of Buffalo.  But they charge like seven bucks for a pack of cigarettes in Canada, but they get social  medicine in return for that.  Right.  We've got a bunch of Indian reservations around here, and Arab people always get arrested  going back to New York City or Detroit by the state police and Route 8617 getting nailed  for that.  Oh, for the cigarettes.  Yeah.  Yeah, they can find them for that, but they can't arrest the ones that are coming in wanting  to kill people. 
[02:40:30]  If you leave the Indian reservation with more than two packs, the state police can nail  you for it.  They scalp them, you.  Funny-looking little fella.  But in Canada, they charge, oh, like 15% sales tax or seven bucks for a pack of cigarettes,  but they have social medicine in return for it.  You were with the funny-looking one?  Seven bucks for cigarettes.  Yeah.  He was the funny-looking one.  All right, John.  Thanks for that info.  Okay.  John?  I got another one.  Anthony? 
[02:41:00]  You okay, Margie?  Yeah.  I have no problem saying that my favorite Naughty Nighty finalist is on the phone right  now.  Oh, oh.  Contestant number 93.  Let me pop that up.  I like playing along at home.  Daniela?  Yes.  What's going on?  Um, I just, I'm kind of pissed because...  Hey.  Oh, hey.  Yes.  You're pissed?  Yes.  Why are you pissed?  Because there's all...  Hold on, hold on.  Hey, watch that.  Hold on.  They don't like the T-word.  Oh, okay.  We, well, only one girl has fake breasts. 
[02:41:30]  And, like, the professional part, it's not professional.  We did it all in their radio station.  We know.  I mean, there was a guy that was holding up the light to get the lighting done.  It's just kind of sad that the girls that didn't make it have to bag on us, you know,  just because they're jealous.  Ooh.  Oh, I like that.  You're spunky.  Ooh.  Yeah, I'm kind of, you know, I mean, I, if they can't handle a competition, then don't  enter the contest.  You don't take a lot of bunk, do you?  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  I'm from Amsterdam.  That's where I grew up.  We know all about you. 
[02:42:00]  I remember you.  You were in Penthoose.  Yeah.  She was in Penthoose.  That's me.  Can you say Penthoose for us?  We'd love it.  Penthoose.  Yeah, we say it in the back office all day long.  Yeah, where's that issue of Penthoose?  Say it at home.  Say it at home, everyone.  It's fun.  I already find it in everything.  It is?  Oh, you sent the Penthoose?  Yes.  Oh, nice.  I promised you guys.  I like her second outfit, the last shot, where she's on the table, her shirt's open, she's  leaning back, like, take me, take me. 
[02:42:30]  A lot of guys going to the club to check you out, Daniela?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're a little celebrity there at the street club.  Well, just because they like my real breath.  I hear it's a run-down place.  I hear there's, like, a hole in the sign out front, and, uh...  Oh, no, they fixed it.  Oh, they finally fixed it?  Mm-hmm.  They finally fixed it.  A darned hole in the sign?  Yeah, that kind of looked tacky, but they fixed it.  Oh, they finally fixed it.  All right.  Uh-huh.  You want to name the place again, or no?  Yeah, thank you.  It's called The Ambers, and I work from 702 on Wednesdays and Fridays.  All right.  Nights.  All right, Daniela.  Well, good luck with the rest of the content. 
[02:43:00]  Thank you, you guys.  You guys suck.  I will tell you this much.  Thank you.  Let me look.  I got the votes right in front of me.  Oh, you do, do you?  Daniela?  Yes?  You're doing quite fine as well.  Oh.  Thank you.  The two girls that called us today are doing very well in the voting.  Make sure you vote every day, opianthony.com.  All right, Daniela.  Thank you.  Bye.  Don't be a stranger.  I won't.  Okay.  Bye.  Our pent-hoose friend.  Pent-hoose.  What did we learn next?  She's in pent-hoose.  That's so strange. 
[02:43:30]  Next, what did you learn today?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  B-E-N-E-W.  Stop, stop, stop.  Rob Zombie, we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Never going to stop.  Ah, the latest from Zombie.  All the fun, right?  Well, we're just about done with this mess.  They all can't be pretty.  That was fun goofing off today. 
[02:44:00]  Wasn't bad at all.  Pretty much it, goofing off.  John from Staten Island.  I learned today Anthony got his first Hummer from Leanne Marinelli in the foyer with the  new floor where he kept his snow boots.  No.  That little whore bag.  We were just friends.  Yeah, he got it all wrong.  Well, he would have got a C on his little test.  Tink from Philly.  Today I learned that Opie only gets one good line a day, but I think it's really about two  or three a week. 
[02:44:30]  You dick.  Tom from Philly.  I learned if it wasn't for the U.S., the Germans would be speaking French, and the black  girl had to sit at the back of the bobsled.  Yes.  Two for me.  I had two today.  Jerry for medicine.  I learned today Dice on Ice will feature midgets on his feet and a special guest appearance  by the Gooks of Hazzard.  Yeah.  Oogie Pringles Ghost from Niagara Falls, Canada, Anthony. 
[02:45:00]  Yes.  I love when people get it.  I learned today Earl won a gold medal in picture hanging.  He also learned a night at McCool's is no brain smasher.  And the equator keeps your ass three inches higher.  Norton rules, but not today.  Thank you, sir.  Greg from Philly.  I learned not to have a dog when I'm old and lonely.  Anthony used to play with a little girl named Leanne Marinelli.  The mayor has time to get a tan, and finally, we're all going to Texas.  Yeah, we did hear that. 
[02:45:30]  Brian from Philly.  Philly representing today.  I learned that not all 6 o'clock queefs end with, did you hear that?  That was a mess today.  Ah, God, I hope I don't mess this one up.  Bluto from the city.  I learned that I can buy cheap chloroform cigarettes from Ricardo Montalblanc at eataballet.com.  That's right, a clause from where?  You know, isn't it funny how you have to make a conscious effort to actually do an impression of my total lack of verbal talent? 
[02:46:00]  It's not as easy to be this big of a thin-lipped flubber.  I had a concentrate there.  I had a concentrate.  Doug from Springfield, what's up?  What's up?  I learned that if the cigarette tax goes into effect, Old Dirty is going into the cigarette business.  No doubt.  No doubt.  Hey, French, you suck feet.  Got your last, pussy.  I know.  Nope.  Oh, well.  We got you.  I suck it!  A little too late there.  TJ, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned two fours in the same joke. 
[02:46:30]  No good.  Right.  More funny.  More funny.  Who knew that, by the way?  Norton did.  So true.  More funny.  I thought two fours was good today.  You've got to throw them off.  Abomination.  You don't want to be predictable.  Yeah, I was today.  Everything I said was predictably horrendous.  Look how nice I've been lately.  Don't want to be predictable.  Ann, what's going on?  Ann?  Hello. 
[02:47:00]  Ann?  Hello.  Ann?  Hello.  Say hi.  What?  Hello.  Ann?  What's your name, maybe?  What's your name?  Dan.  Dan?  Yeah, I'm 13.  Representing the youth of sleepers.  We thought your name was Ann, dude.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Because you sound like a chick.  Hey, he's representing the youth of Cleveland, though.  Let's relax with Dan.  What's up, Dan?  You know what I learned?  You stupid faggot.  Hey.  Hey, he's 13, Ann.  That's Frenchy. 
[02:47:30]  I learned the white man can't jump, but black man sure can't stay out in the cold very long.  Oh, well, there he goes.  You know what?  Black people told us that.  Oh, stop it.  They did?  Oh, yeah?  Thank you.  Let's go to Brian.  Bottle doodle.  Brian, what did you learn on the show today?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, I learned that before I die, I should shoot my dogs.  Take care, fellas.  That's very good.  See, we did do some things today on the show.  You guys did.  Let's go to Todd.  Todd, what did you learn today?  Yeah, I learned two things real quick. 
[02:48:00]  I learned that Frenchy is horrible, no matter if he's in the studio or on sound clips.  And I also learned that Norton rules even when he sucks.  Cool.  Thank you.  You drink, hit a beanie.  See you, guys.  All right, Todd.  Later, fella.  You dumb, Rube.  We got girls coming in tomorrow to try out for the 55-gallon drum challenge?  I believe so.  I sure hope so.  Ben's saying yes.  Get stinky here.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned today that 6 o'clock weave, always better to end it in. 
[02:48:30]  Dude, she's messing all over the place.  Better than.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear that?  Yeah, today's was very funny.  All right, boys, you suck.  It was a little messy.  All right.  Let's go to Samantha.  Stinky, get on the mic.  Samantha, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  All right.  I learned that the white ones are the crazy ones that are out with no shirts in the winter  time at the games.  Right.  Yes.  And Norton, breathe.  Did I say breathe or breathe?  Yeah, you got to calm down a little bit.  Oh.  Take a breath. 
[02:49:00]  You're a little edgy.  Sully, what's up?  Hey, I learned that even the black bobsledders have to ride in the back.  Oh.  Earl.  Phone dry here.  That makes it all good, right?  That's very good.  That makes it all okay.  Very funny.  Wow, look at that screensaver of Contestant No. 79 in that other studio.  Oh, it's like her crotch.  That's Taylor, right?  Right in the screen.  They blew up Taylor's picture and made it take up the whole screen, her crotch.  Very nice.  Stinky, we got girls coming down to try out for the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[02:49:30]  Sort of.  What?  What sort of?  What do you mean sort of?  Girls call them with good ideas.  Well, just get them down here.  We'll beat them into submission.  Body pretzel girl, great.  Well, we have an open audition tomorrow and Friday, so ladies.  Come down.  Just show up and try to impress us to get in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  That means no one will show up tomorrow.  No.  Nope.  As usual.  Kev, could you read your own plug?  Please.  Here you are, Kev. 
[02:50:00]  Old plug.  Kev supplies us with bad guests, but that are good for us.  We like the bad guests.  Right.  Like Dr. Smith and the guy that was in the suit of the robot.  Bob May.  And he supplies us with action figures.  Everyone has enjoyed.  What did you get?  You got a good Aussie.  I've gotten two nice Aussie dolls waiting for the third, but I like the two I got very much.  Very good.  And Kev, where do you get those?  A few people.  Steve Hammondy over at Miss Farland Toys.  I met him.  He's quite insane.  He sent Opie a Piazza toy from the new line. 
[02:50:30]  Pretty excited.  Yeah.  I can tell.  That's why you get so many.  I'll put it right there.  Parker's Tortured Souls.  Yes.  Those I like.  They're very twisted and will give you nightmares.  Now they're care of Time Warp Comics in Cedar Grove, 973-857-9788.  I'll suck it!  And you can check them all out at www.spawn.com.  You stupid faggot. 
[02:51:00]  Thank you.  Big cap.  All right.  We got to get off.  My bad.  My bad.  We got to get off the air here.  All right, man.  Ben's going crazy.  Hopefully tomorrow, ladies will show up to impress us with the 55-gallon.  Please.  We got something for New York and I guess Philly and maybe Boston if they want to drive  down from Boston, right?  We got a couple pairs of tickets to see Incubus at Madison Square Garden on Friday, June 21st  before they go on sale.  Tickets go on sale this Saturday at 9 a.m. through all Ticketmaster outlets.  We'll take a couple random calls to give away the Incubus tickets, okay? 
[02:51:30]  All right.  See you tomorrow, man.  What?  Oh, yeah.  He got you.  He got you, man.  When in New York City, stay at the Park Central, New York, 7th Avenue, near Broadway Theatres  and Central Park, 1-800-346-1359.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  N-E-W on the next Ron and Fez.  After O&A, listen to Ron and Fez where you can win a trip to Avanti Spa.  Be the first caller when you hear sweet Melissa, Moon. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, my bourgeois, buddy.  What's a bourgeois?  It's something you don't have but wish you did.  It's a sandwich?  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W. </pre>
