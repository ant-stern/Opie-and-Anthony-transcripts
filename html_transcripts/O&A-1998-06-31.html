<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with studio guest Archie Bunker recounting a wildly exaggerated and humorous anecdote about a cab ride involving C4 explosives.  This was followed by a prank call segment featuring a sexually explicit conversation with a woman who believed she was speaking to someone named "Jose."  The hosts then transitioned into a discussion of various topics, including their opinions on Third Eye Blind concert tickets, a lawsuit against a stripper for alleged whiplash injuries caused by her breasts, and the finale of *Family Matters*.  A caller contributed to the discussion by sharing his perspective on the comparative intelligence of men and women.

Further segments included a discussion of Prince Charles' sex education talk with Prince William, followed by Archie Bunker's own recollections of his sex education experiences.  Comedian Jeff Norris appeared on the show to promote his upcoming stand-up performances.  Throughout the broadcast, music from various artists was played.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  27 WNEW, the rock of New York Goo Goo Dolls and Iris.  It's Opie and Anthony and Archie Bunker as I stop on by today to hang with the program.  Hello Archie there, hello my fellow New Yorkers there, hi.  Let me give you a word of advice there, hi.  Don't go waving down no cabs there.  You gotta see the episode I had getting to the damn station over here, hi.  Was not pleasant over there, hi.  I'm waving down to get in the car, I didn't know what the heck to expect here, hi.  I asked the guy to take me over there to the building there, next thing you know he's pulling over buying some C4 there, hi. 
[00:00:30]  Oh jeez there, I bet you that's the guy that went back for the deposit on the van anyway there, hi.  Oh my God, are you implying that cab driver's a terrorist?  Oh, don't go, what the heck do you think of, who do you think blew up the building there, howdy doody, hi.  What the heck, what the heck you got in your coffee over there, hi.  Jeez there.  Oh very good man.  Hey, we got a lady on the line.  She's looking for Jose. 
[00:01:00]  Who's Jose?  It's not you, it's not I, it's not Archie, obviously.  Oh jeez, don't you ever call me that word again, hi.  Jeez, dad, only I don't even go to Chaco Bell over there because of that name, hi.  Jose, yeah, that poor little chihuahua made a fool out of itself there, hi.  I guess this woman just slept with Jose last night and she's calling Jose at work to thank him for last night.  All right, want to mess with her a little bit?  Yeah, shh, shh, shh, shh.  What's up, mommy? 
[00:01:30]  Don't play with me.  What's up, baby?  Yeah, what's up?  You looking for Jose?  Mm-hmm, you know Jose?  Yeah.  All right, what's up?  What's up?  You had fun last night?  Yeah, we was down with it.  What's you doing?  Nice.  Nice?  I felt good.  Yeah.  Damn, I was shocked.  I was like, damn.  Yeah, that was good, huh?  You ever have it like that?  Nah.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell me what you liked?  You have a nice f***.  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Am I getting promoted with you?  No, no.  Tell me more.  I like when you talk like that.  Word.  What else did you like?  I liked f*** your night.  What, what, you like the little thing I do?  Mm-hmm.  Those moves?  Yeah, I'm saying put it on.  Yeah.  Wait, um, I mean, I don't, I can't believe I just told you.  You don't even sound like Jose.  You're his brother.  I could go all night.  No doubt.  Yeah.  See, I had to leave early yesterday.  You, I know, you're good, too. 
[00:02:30]  You got the moves, baby.  I know, man.  Yeah.  I like that.  Where could you meet me at?  What would you want me to do?  The same thing you left.  Yeah?  Yeah, but bring more weed.  Bring more weed?  The weed, yeah.  We just did it.  Yeah, you want me to bring some toys?  Yeah.  Like what?  Like a vibrator.  I don't need that.  I want you to get f***.  You want to do it outside, in the park?  In the park, not.  Yeah.  Do it in the bushes.  In the bushes?  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Get a hotel.  I can't afford that.  You come to my house.  What about your mama?  My mother.  What if I bring another girl?  I'm going to stay outside my doorstep.  Get all three of us going, maybe.  Oh, that sounds pretty good.  Yeah.  That might be a good idea.  Yeah, mommy.  Me, you, your mama, a couple of friends, my Rottweiler, some power tools.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Oh, I was going to score. 
[00:03:30]  It took her forever to figure it out.  Very good.  What a whore.  Let's give away some tickets to see Third Eye Blind at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  We got a pair for the show on the 15th.  Max is working the phones.  He'll take the 10th.  Call her at 212-757-1027.  Congratulations to Aaron Trowering of Flushing.  That's where you were born, right, Anthony?  That's right.  All right.  He's got a pair of tickets to check out Third Eye Blind.  We'll have more tickets next hour.  But right now, it's ever clear.  I will buy you a new life on the Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW. 
[00:04:00]  1027-WNEW, Where Rock Lives, The Gin Blossom.  Also in that set, Squeeze and Grantley Buffalo with Truly, Truly, a song they did live on  Dave Herman's show a couple of weeks ago, I guess, by now.  Yeah.  And we're going to have lots of performers coming through the NEW studios in the coming months.  I guarantee that.  Yeah.  Well, thanks for listening.  It's Opie. 
[00:04:30]  It's Anthony.  And we got a guest in the studio today.  We got Archie Bunker.  Oh, jeez, how we doing out there, America?  Hi.  Pretty good.  Oh, that's pretty good, yeah, hi.  You're spending a little time with us today, which is cool.  Oh, jeez, you know, I like you guys very much.  Here we are there.  You know, I've got to tell you something, folks, here, all right?  Yeah.  This is like opening in Anthony's basement, there, all right?  Fine place there, a little air conditioning.  It's very comfortable, there, all right?  On the way over here, I took a cab.  Yeah, don't ever take a cab in NYC, there, all right?  Nothing personal there.  Mary Giuliani, I know you're doing the best you can here, all right? 
[00:05:00]  But I was sweating like Mark Furman at the Million Man March coming over here.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't say that.  Come on, come on.  Hey, hey, what's up with that?  All right, then, I'm sorry.  I meant to say I was sweating like Michael Jackson in the Toys R Us, then, huh?  You can say that.  Oh, jeez, then, hi.  Hey, do you and me that, you know, still do the nasty, or...?  Well, what the heck does that mean, eh?  What do you mean, the dishes?  What the hell are you talking about, eh?  You're doing the nasty, you know?  The heart's on a bar.  A little intimate.  Oh, well, see, the intimacy, see what happened with that, yeah, huh? 
[00:05:30]  I had a couple, too many shaffes, beer one night, next thing you know, boom, nine months  later, here's the little girly coming out, eh, huh?  But, no, at my age, yeah, the only thing I get up is out of the chair, huh?  My aggro wouldn't even help me, you know what I'm talking about?  Really?  Oh, absolutely not, yeah.  I'm getting a little too old for that stuff, eh, huh?  All right.  I just watched the movies, did I?  Yeah.  And, well, I don't mean to cut in, Archie.  Oh, me neither.  Can you guys put a lock in a store over here with your stink breath yet?  Well, they have a new thing out for women to help women get moist in the area. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, really?  Really?  Well, it's not called Viagra, it's Niagara.  We need a drum in here.  Oh, jeez, did you see what I got to tell you?  There's a new thing you should try.  It's called a muzzle there, huh?  Hey, are you reading the paper today?  Prince Charles.  Prince Charles.  He gave the speech to his son, Prince William.  What speech?  The birds and the bees talk.  Oh, jeez, sir.  He gave to what?  That's like having a Japanese guy teach English class there, huh? 
[00:06:30]  I teach that guy's a half a fag over there, huh?  Oh, wait, come on.  Archie can't say that.  What's he talking?  Wait, wait, wait.  What made Archie so outrageous?  Wait a minute, he's a prince of England, and England a fag means a cigarette, eh?  That's right.  You can't yell at me for that, eh?  All right?  Wow, Archie's learned nothing in the past 30 years or so.  Well, jeez, you know, I used to do my own thing over there, all right?  You know, I got to bring up something, though.  Yeah.  So the prince gives his son the birds and the bees talk? 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Yes, of course.  Come here, son.  Come here, there.  Okay.  No playing wanky-wanky with your willy anymore.  I'm going to teach you a bit of the birds and the bees.  First, grab a bird.  Find a lovely young bird.  If you want to have enough jewels to get any bird you please.  Then start fiddling with the naughty bits.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle with the naughty bits.  Yes, before you know it, you're having two princes. 
[00:07:30]  Wonderful.  Now, go scurry.  Play polo whenever you do.  Very good.  But remember when you were younger?  Of course, with these ears.  I did leave quite a few suction cup-like marks on quite a few thighs.  Tell you now.  Go scurry.  Go scurry.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Remember when you were in, like, sixth grade?  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  And it got to that time where you had to learn about the birds and the bees?  Oh, jeez.  Look at Archie.  Oh, jeez.  That was quite a few years ago.  Yeah, okay.  Remember you went to grammar school?  Yeah.  And out of nowhere, they start separating the boys and the girls?  Yeah, all of a sudden, the health teacher or gym teacher came in.  I remember this.  Yes.  And they go, okay, we need all the girls to get up and come to the gymnasium.  Right.  And all the boys go into the cafeteria.  And you're like, what is this? 
[00:08:30]  They think of the show.  It's the film.  No, not the film.  No.  Before you know it, you say, like, it's a hostage thing.  They just took you with no prior notice that this was going to happen.  They sink it down in front of a film.  Johnny's starting to grow hair in places he didn't have it before.  He's starting to notice girls.  No!  Billy still thinks girls are creepy.  But that's okay.  Things will change and Billy will start liking girls just like Johnny. 
[00:09:00]  Johnny's noticing he has to wash in places.  Or he may build a foul odor.  Right.  His feet are getting bigger.  He's feeling clumsy.  His breasts may hurt and his voice will change.  This is all part of adolescence.  You're sitting there in shock.  There's like your teacher.  There's like your teacher standing there.  And it's just a horror to look at the gym teacher and see sex. 
[00:09:30]  And you're a kid and it's awkward.  And you're like, can't we just go outside and play another game of kickball?  Yeah.  I don't want to deal with this.  Why do you have to start this?  And then know what they said at the end of the film.  They stand up and go, well, we informed your parents that we're showing you this film today.  So if you have any questions about what you learned today, your parents will be glad to talk to you about it.  That was the longest walk home in the history of men, I think.  I lived like two minutes from school.  It took me an hour and a half.  I'm like, no, I don't want to go home. 
[00:10:00]  No, no, no.  So I walk in the door.  And my dad goes, hey, son.  How was school today?  Fine.  No.  And I ran outside.  This is a true story.  I ran outside and I climbed an apple tree.  You climbed an apple tree?  Yeah, because I knew the talk was coming.  And I stayed in that tree for two hours, son.  You coming down?  No, I'm not.  Not if you're going to start talking about mom's boobs.  You didn't want to hear anything about that.  No, I did not.  That was horrendous.  You know something?  It is best just left learned in the street. 
[00:10:30]  It really is.  You know, there might be people that disagree with that, but it really is.  It's traumatic.  You don't want your parents or that big burly gym teacher, let me teach you about this.  We're going to learn about the penis today.  We're going to learn what the hell you're supposed to do with it.  It's like, what?  No, not from you.  Please.  I was doing fine with my friends.  And that was the street with the Playboy magazine.  Coincidentally enough, that was the girl gym teacher.  Hey, if you're still around, you deserve a prize, right, Anthony? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  We got a pair of tickets to see Third Eye Blind at the Hammerstein Ballroom on the 15th.  Max working the phones.  He'll take the 10th caller at 212-757-1027.  We rock on with Bon Jovi on N.E.W.  Shot through the heart and you're...  1027-W-N-E-W, the rock of New York.  That's the latest from Harvey Danger, flagpole Siddha.  He's warming up for Semi-Sonic tonight at the Bowery Ballroom. 
[00:11:30]  Bowery.  That's right.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's Archie Bunker hanging with us today.  Oh, geez.  How we doing, everybody?  I hope you're staying tuned in to the basement.  Yeah, he calls our show the Opie and Anthony Basement.  I like that concept.  It is like a basement.  It's kind of a place to hang out.  Oh, it's very cozy in here.  A couple beanbag chairs all over the place.  A little pinball wizard in the corner.  And they got hockey and knock hockey table over there, too, right?  So, did your dad ever give you the birds and the bees, sir?  Oh, I didn't think he was going to go there, but, well, he was back a while ago, eh? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  You see, it was right before WW2, eh?  Did you two guys serve your country, eh?  Of course, yeah.  Yeah, we did.  Oh, geez.  Yeah, that's about as convenient as a $3 bill, eh, eh?  You're about as real as Silk Roses over there, eh?  Well, we're kind of young.  There was no wars, really.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, right before I got drafted there in the WW2, there to show you my country, eh,  eh?  My father gave me a story about the plates and the bees, eh, right before I met the little 
[00:12:30]  girlie out there, eh?  So, he sits me down.  He says, Archie, my son, eh?  There's a few things I need you to know about life, eh, eh?  But the girlie's walking around, eh?  Eh, you're going to notice some changes going on in yourself there and then.  For the talk last in an hour and a half there, and I got to tell you, after the talk there,  I was, uh, well, in all honesty there, I was hotter than Chinese math, eh?  Oh, you can't say that.  Come on.  Come on, Archie.  I was hotter than Chinese math.  What's the matter with that?  It ain't too profound there, eh?  All right, good.  Because you got yourself wet behind the ears over there, eh? 
[00:13:00]  But anyway, I went up to my room there after that, eh?  My father walked in.  He caught me doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing there, eh?  Yeah.  He said, son, don't do that, eh?  Don't shave it until you're 21.  By the time I was 21, I had nine jars.  All right.  Come on.  Oh, man.  Come on.  God.  I don't remember Archie being quite like this.  Yeah, our listeners don't want to hear that.  All right, all right, yeah, all right.  Come on.  You erased that from your memory banks, eh?  All right.  We'll try, that's for sure.  Wow. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, uh, did you hear about Tony Peaks?  What happened?  That's that, uh, that dancer that smacked that guy in the head and he's suing her?  Yeah, Tony Peaks, the stripper with the huge cans, um, yeah, she, she, supposedly, you  know, knocked, uh, her boobs against this guy's head during a bachelor party and the guy  suffered from whiplash and other injuries and he's suing, you know, Tony Peaks for 15  grand.  Wow.  What a meathead, huh?  The only thing I ever got hit of that he just had a pair of was his shoes, huh? 
[00:14:00]  Well, this case was on people's court, uh, yesterday with Ed Koch.  Oh.  The grumpy old Ed Koch, who hates everybody, it seems.  That's like, doesn't that pretty much degrade the whole case?  Of course it does.  Like, the guy was really serious about this and then it ends up on the people's court.  It's like, you aren't all that serious.  I got a little message here for Ed Koch, huh?  There's a new thing you should try here, it's called Social Security, huh?  Hang it up, Jerry, Megan, hi, head crotch, Jerry.  Well, to help reach the decision, Koch ordered the court officer to examine the memories of 
[00:14:30]  exotic dancer Tony Peaks.  Get out of here.  How is he going to do that?  Well, uh, it was a female court officer and she actually felt him up.  No, on TV?  I, well, I guess they, you know.  Or maybe in the chambers.  Yeah, there you go.  Come into my chambers.  It turns out the, the, the breasts weighed two pounds each.  Two pounds each.  So, Koch threw the, the case out of court because of that.  Thinking that two pounds cannot possibly do all that damage.  They look just like Ed Koch's head, too. 
[00:15:00]  The top of his head.  And the court officer also said they were very soft.  Really?  Yeah, so.  What the heck was going on in that court?  Wow, that's pretty, uh, provocative.  Well, it looks like you're in that jury there, huh?  Yeah, without a doubt.  Well, your honor, we can't reach a decision until I cop a field here, huh?  But I guess, um, they, they were talking about the case and, and one of these, uh, guys that  were at the bachelor party, uh, supposedly saw what happened.  He said, no, the girl took her breasts and, and slammed my buddy, you know, across the 
[00:15:30]  head a few times.  And, uh, Tony Peaks goes, I object.  What I actually did was I held him up to make it look like he had Mickey Mouse, uh, ears.  How embarrassing, huh?  That's pretty embarrassing.  Unbelievable.  I know, uh, I, I agree with the guy, though, because I did get hit with, uh, some gargantuan  breasts.  Yeah, Archie, did you hear about this?  Yeah.  Oh, what's your hair?  And, and, and they, they might be soft to the touch.  Right.  But if you remember an old toy called Stretch Armstrong.  Right.  Remember that thing?  You used to pull it, and it felt soft if you squeezed it. 
[00:16:00]  But if you wrapped your little brother over the head with it, you'd knock him out.  Sure.  That's exactly how the, the breasts worked.  And we do have video of Anthony getting knocked out by big breasts.  It hurt.  It was very funny.  It was funny.  I might sue.  It wasn't Edith, no.  No, it wasn't Edith.  Wrapped around my neck and choked me.  Hey, we haven't taken any, uh, phone calls this afternoon.  Why?  Or just a couple, anyway.  Been too busy with Archie.  Got something to add to the program today.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:16:30]  Fax line 2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W.  Here's Don Henley.  On the Rock of New York.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, where Rock lives.  Pat Benatar in there and the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band, Blue on Black.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  And Archie sitting in on the corner there. 
[00:17:00]  Are we doing over there?  We're doing okay, Archie.  Anthony, your favorite show is on TV tomorrow.  I'm a little choked up, quite frankly.  Yeah, Family Matters is on tomorrow, right?  Yeah, the final episode of Family Matters is on tomorrow.  I'm going to miss that show.  You really like Urkel, don't you?  Oh, yeah.  Has to be one of the defining characters of the 90s, I think.  This poor guy is so out of work. 
[00:17:30]  So out of work, it's pathetic.  Jaleel White.  Yeah.  Stephen Urkel.  Yes.  And Family Matters, the last episode going out with not much of a fanfare.  Not quite the final episode of Seinfeld.  I don't think there's many Family Matters parties going on.  No, I heard they're, like, burying this final episode.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nine o'clock tomorrow night on Friday night.  Who's going to stay home tomorrow night to watch that?  No one.  No fanfare.  CBS pretty much buried it.  Are they admitting that they're burying it?  Well, yeah.  They're not very proud of it. 
[00:18:00]  It was actually on the ABC schedule for many years.  And CBS bought it, trying to get some ratings.  But no one came over to watch.  So what do you think the problem is with Urkel and Family Matters?  Let me think.  Let's think.  When the show started, I think he was, what, nine?  Yeah.  And it was cute to walk around and go, look at me.  I've got these short pants on.  And I'm really cute.  And I do stupid things.  And then I, well, now he's, what, 35, 40?  Is he 40 years old, Urkel? 
[00:18:30]  And he's still, oh, look at me.  I'm dressed up.  Now it's, like, it's pathetic to watch.  Yeah.  It's, like, and he's professional help.  Yeah.  They're using spackle to keep the whiskers from showing, first of all.  And then the poor guy, Jaleel White, goes out.  And people are like, hey, Urkel.  Right.  Look, it's Urkel.  Look at Urkel.  And he's like, no, man.  I'm Jaleel White.  I'm an actor.  No, Urkel, Urkel, shut up.  And then he's got to get on the show.  Oh, look at me.  Look at how high my pants are. 
[00:19:00]  It's amazing.  Look how nerdy I am.  Isn't it cute?  You're 55 years old.  It's not cute anymore.  So you're saying it was cute when he was nine.  Yeah.  But it's all over.  Yeah.  Look for Jaleel in his next role behind the counter at Taco Bell.  Hi, N.E.W.  Who am I talking to?  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, the both of you guys?  Yeah.  I want to tell you guys, I think you're a riot.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's that?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't think you heard that.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:19:30]  What'd you say?  What'd you say?  I think you're a riot.  A riot.  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  It took three weeks that we got a positive call on the phone line.  Oh, thanks for the call there.  You're a riot.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  I don't think Archie's doing that bad over there either, you know.  Okay.  You're a riot there in my corner.  Man, I don't care what race you are, what color, anything you want to welcome to come  in while you have a shit in my chair and have a free beer on me, all right?  You guys had me roaring yesterday with the fidget thing.  Oh, the fidget? 
[00:20:00]  I love your impressions of people.  You guys are pretty good.  The fidget.  You got a friend on a jersey, sure.  Well, we're not allowed to say fidget on the radio anymore.  What's that?  Oh, that's right.  Well, fidget.  We had a talking to today.  They're not called fidgets.  They're called little people.  They're called fidget Americans.  Well, you weren't talking about them.  You were talking about the fidgets.  Because it's a little rascal to say fidget.  Yeah, that little rascal said it.  Stimey went, them's not babies, them's fidgets.  I was right there with them when I was growing up. 
[00:20:30]  Cool.  And also, I've been accused of being clothes-minded  because I said dwarfs all look alike.  They just have different wigs on.  Even Archie is disgusted with that one.  Archie, what's wrong with you?  Archie, I don't even think I would even think of that one myself, man.  Chuck one up for Opie over there.  That was horrible, Opie.  One of my best friends was a dwarf,  and I don't think you guys were that harsh on him.  No, we're just having fun. 
[00:21:00]  It's all in front here.  We love everybody here.  Well, almost here.  We've got to laugh.  Thanks a lot for checking in today.  Okay.  All right.  Awesome.  Wow, finally a positive call.  Yeah.  Also got to say hi to Louise in the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  She's checking us out today.  Louise.  And she said she's enjoying the festivities today.  Yeah, that's nice.  We're getting some people with the show.  Yes.  Involved.  I like that.  A few.  Still more people hate us than like us.  That's all right.  We will attempt to change that, okay? 
[00:21:30]  Richard from the Transit Authority likes us, too?  All right.  Very good.  We'll add him to the less.  The T.A. boys.  Hey, we're giving away tickets to see Third Eye Blind at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  Or the Hammerstein Ballroom.  I keep saying Hammerstein.  I don't know why.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  We've got a pair of tickets for the 15th show.  And they're coming into play next week for us.  Yeah.  That's going to be very cool.  We've got Max working the phones.  He'll take the 10th caller for the Third Eye Blind tickets at 212-757-1027.  Must buy khakis. 
[00:22:00]  Must buy khakis.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Brian Setzer Orchestra.  Jump, jive, and wail.  Coming to town next week.  And I was just informed that he's coming in to play live on our show.  I hope we have enough room in the NAW studios for Brian Setzer and his lovely orchestra.  You could land a DC-10 in here.  This is a great, great studio, actually.  Nice big studio.  It's going to be fun.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Just about out the door.  We've got to thank Archie for coming on in. 
[00:22:30]  Hello, Archie.  Thanks for having me.  Hey, Edith, yeah, hi.  Get the hell out of the coupon book.  It's time to go in, hi.  Wait, can you bring Edith in to say hi real fast?
