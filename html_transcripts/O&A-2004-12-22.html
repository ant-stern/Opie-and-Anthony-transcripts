<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a nonsensical Godzilla song, seguing into a discussion about the difficulties of Christmas shopping for children.  Anthony recounted his girlfriend's decorating efforts and joked about his attempts to display his Catholic faith through Christmas lights in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood.  He then launched into a lengthy story about a disastrous fireplace incident involving coffee-scented "java logs," resulting in a smoky house and a fire department visit, all while wearing flannel pajamas.  This was followed by another anecdote about a burst pipe causing significant flooding in his apartment, leading to a 9-1-1 call and a police visit where the officers were more interested in their careers than the water damage.  The incident involved a near electrocution and a collapsing ceiling.

The conversation shifted to their return to terrestrial radio in Syracuse on WAQX-FM after a stint on XM Satellite Radio, discussing the censorship differences and the media attention surrounding their return. They reminisced about past conflicts with Howard Stern, including being denied entry to the Viacom VIP room at the MTV Music Awards and being forcibly removed from a Stern press conference.  They contrasted their negative experiences with Stern and Infinity Broadcasting, particularly the fallout from the "Sex for Sam" incident, with their positive experience at XM.  They detailed being excluded from Stern's events and expressed bitterness towards executives like John Sykes, recounting anecdotes such as Sykes fleeing from Opie at a buffet line and highlighting the hypocrisy of Stern criticizing Billy Crystal for ejecting Stuttering John from a press conference while simultaneously having Opie and Anthony removed from his own.  This segment included a raunchy, profanity-laced rendition of a South Park Christmas song about Mary and Jesus, followed by vulgar discussions about strip clubs and coffee preferences, mentioning Jim Norton's "diva" behavior. Listener calls and mentions of their online chatroom, "Foundry," were incorporated, along with a mention of Gary Hoey doing the rejoiners that week, and a promotion of a video clip of Opie injuring his hand during a stunt involving a woman with large breasts.

The broadcast continued with Anthony’s offensive rant about a negative experience at a Toronto strip club with Asian dancers, where he engaged in racist commentary and conspiracy theories about Asians and cats being aliens. This was followed by Opie’s sarcastic remarks about a colleague’s $50,000 loss, resulting in angry dismissals of listeners who misunderstood his sarcasm.  A caller described a unique strip club experience in Western Pennsylvania, and the hosts mocked a unicyclist on television. The segment featured the song "Brother Joe and the Sarsong," containing racist and offensive lyrics about SARS, and several other extremely offensive and racist songs provided by a producer, eliciting numerous calls from listeners with varying opinions. Pat Croce called in, discussing his new TV show, sharing NBA anecdotes (including the Detroit Pistons brawl), and promoting his pirate museum in Key West. They also briefly discussed Slam Ball and mentioned "Stalker Patty" and her unusual gifts.  The segment ended with a preview of an upcoming guest, Shannon Mullen, author of "The Best Love You’ll Ever Have," focusing on the sexually explicit content of her book.

The December 22nd, 2004, broadcast included XM Satellite Radio advertisements, a segment on ACC college basketball scores and commentary, and listener calls, one of which contained a racially insensitive joke. Another caller discussed the challenges of editing the show for commercial radio.  The hosts discussed nicknames. "Stalker Patty" appeared in studio with gifts, leading to a conversation about her upcoming 50th birthday, virginity, and experiences with dating and the Christian Fellowship, including a humorous anecdote about a graphic Christian book on abstinence. The main interview was with Shannon Mullen, author of "The Best You'll Ever Have," which involved explicit discussions about sexual topics, including sexual myths (particularly about anal sex), the G-spot, clitoral and penile similarities, and orgasms.  Listeners called in with questions and personal experiences, including one recounting an incident involving a cold and anal sex, and another describing a bizarre sexual request from his wife. The segment ended with further XM radio promotion and a musical interlude.

The show's final segment featured numerous listener calls with sexually explicit questions and discussions about various sexual fetishes and practices, including scat, tush sex, and oral sex.  Callers described fetishes, sought advice on introducing scat to a partner, managing gag reflexes during oral sex, and dealing with various sexual situations.  One caller detailed dating another man's girlfriend and sought advice, another caller in prison asked about homosexual activity in prison, and a caller recounted childhood experiences involving mutual oral sex with friends (“Monster Rain”). A caller discussed a habit of having prostitutes urinate on his throat and played a message from his mother suggesting he replace this habit with exercise; a comedian also called in to discuss his preference for prostitutes urinating on him.  Discussions included "pussy farts" and encounters with male prostitutes.  Shannon Mullen, the sexpert, offered advice throughout.  The broadcast abruptly ended after Shannon's phone line disconnected multiple times, followed by brief discussion of her behavior and the calls received, advertisements, and the conclusion of the segment, along with a brief, unrelated discussion of the board game Monopoly.

[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Good morning. 
[00:08:30]  Good morning.  And the governor gets you to call me.  Now we are having fun.  Now we are having fun.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:09:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  On XM satellite radio, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to you.  Thanks to you, our faithful fans.  Thanks to you, our faithful fans.  Yes!  I didn't pop up my web browsers. 
[00:09:30]  Getting more gooder every day.  More gooder.  Only a few days before Christmas.  Christmas.  Yes.  And we're working.  I don't know why, but we are.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.  It certainly did.  What happened?  I don't know, man.  This is obviously the week you should just take off when you're in radio land.  Mm-hmm.  No one else is working.  Yeah.  We're just going to give them crappy shows.  You know, we have all this great best of material that we could just be throwing the  fine folks out there.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  And we could be Christmas shopping.  Ugh.  Instead, I'm going to be in a panic in about two days when I'm running around the malls  Christmas Eve trying to figure out what to get everybody.  I know you're escaping for Christmas, but there's got to be some presents you have  to get.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I got kids.  Well, I don't have kids personally.  I got kids.  Not that I know of.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, ho.  Stop it, you.  That would mean that you, and then you didn't know.  Right.  Well, there was that time.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:10:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Can you imagine?  All of a sudden, like, just some, I don't know, teenage girl comes walking through the  door.  Hey, guess what?  Oh.  No, I got nephews and nieces and stuff, so they don't understand that the uncle is blowing  off Christmas this year.  They still want their gifts, right?  Of course they do.  So I got to figure that out.  I'm sure.  Do you hook the little kids up pretty good?  I used to, but they don't really care.  Yeah.  Because they get so many gifts, and they're at that age that they can't really appreciate  every gift.  They just open one and go, oh, wow, cool, thanks, throw it aside, and then, you know, 
[00:11:00]  open up the other gifts.  They don't see the difference between something really good and just like a wrapped up stick.  That's kind of what I figured out.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, so you got a couple more years where you really don't have to go all out.  Yeah, exactly.  I figured that out a long time ago.  I used to go hardcore.  They're really nice gifts for the kids, and it's like, you know, my, I don't know, let's  just say $300, $400 gift is just as important to them as the tiny little $5 puzzle that someone 
[00:11:30]  else gave them.  True.  So you got to wait a couple years until they can appreciate it.  That's right.  Then we'll go back to the big ticket item gifts.  The little electric cars and stuff.  Wow, I see we got Christmas decorations in here.  Somebody, Eric, was that you?  Grab the bull by the horns and listen to my little raving and ranting yesterday that  it doesn't look Christmassy in here, and put up decorations. 
[00:12:00]  I think this took exactly two minutes to do.  Well, regardless of how long it took, I kind of applaud the effort.  I think it's the thought that counts.  Thank you, Eric.  There's garland draped over the windows to the studio, the little soundproof windows,  and there's bows on the microphones, and Christmas lights in front of the window that  goes into the office area.  These decorations stink.  They really do.  It looks more Christmassy. 
[00:12:30]  These are the decorations you see at your 95-year-old great aunt's house, you know?  Like the red garland?  No, they're just drooped.  Looks like the living room.  They're not really hung that nice.  They're just kind of drooping across the speakers and the window and stuff.  What were you going to say, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  It's just awful.  Awful.  They're awful, right?  Yes.  Thanks.  I like how they're put up with Scotch tape.  I know.  It's kind of hanging.  During the show, you're going to hear, tick, tick, tick. 
[00:13:00]  When they fall off, tick, tick, tick.  Well, all right.  Well, that looks more...  It looks more Christmassy in here, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had to Christmas up my house a little bit.  Oh, that's right.  Actually, my girlfriend did all the work.  I thought you did.  I called you last night and you said you were outside hanging up lights and stuff.  I'm like, Anthony was outside.  It was like 17 degrees yesterday.  You can't even stand walking from the building a block to get your car.  I bundle up like an Eskimo and I shiver the whole way to my car. 
[00:13:30]  It's awful.  It's an awful walk from here to the parking garage.  No, all I did was throw one of those light blankets they make now.  They really make it easy for people.  You open the box up and unravel this thing and it's a blanket.  It's like a net mesh with Christmas lights on it.  And you just throw it over your bush or your bushes in front of your house.  Oh, wow.  So now you don't have to go around and around with the individual strand of lights.  You just throw these blankets over your trees. 
[00:14:00]  Very cool.  Very cool.  So I did that to like two of them.  But no, no, my girlfriend took care of like putting them around the garage door.  And you were telling me last night, I called Anthony goes, I was outside marking my territory.  I have to let the Jewish neighbors there know that there's a Catholic on the black by gum on the block.  Sorry.  Catholic on the black.  There's a black on the.  Look out.  I don't think the Catholic Church would appreciate that, man.  The Freudian slips.  There's no blacks in my neighborhood. 
[00:14:30]  A Catholic on a black.  Wow.  On the block.  Wow.  You know what?  All right.  You know what they would do to you in our neighborhood?  Ouch.  It was.  Yeah.  So, you know, I had to have some lights and let people know that we celebrate Christmas  in our house.  Not that Hanukkah stuff.  Are you one of the only ones?  One of the only households?  I saw one other lonely house kind of way down the block with some Christmas lights on  it.  But no, for the most part, it's menorahs in the windows or no decorations whatsoever. 
[00:15:00]  Mm-hmm.  And I was feeling a little, you know.  Did you get yourself a nice blow up frosty?  No, none of those.  I should have like the big plastic snowman and Santa for the front lawn.  Really do it up and piss the neighbors off.  I want to, I just want to pop those things.  They're everywhere now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very popular item.  I remember a couple years back, you know, maybe one person in the neighborhood had and  you're like, oh, wow, that's kind of neat.  You know, blow up a, you know, frosty the snowman.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:15:30]  That's different than what you usually see in front of houses.  Yeah.  Now every house has it.  Yeah.  They get, they take off.  After a while, I remember years ago when the icicle lights first came out.  Yeah.  Somebody decided instead of just a string of lights, you could have the string of lights and  other strings hanging off of that string of lights so it looks like icicles.  Mm-hmm.  And when you first saw them, it was like, wow, that's kind of unique and new.  Now everyone has them and they're not special anymore.  I was going to get it like a, I was thinking of getting a manger scene to really piss off  the neighbors. 
[00:16:00]  Imagine that.  It's just a complete Jewish neighborhood and having little baby Jesus in the little manger  scene.  You really should.  It would, I think it would spruce up the neighborhood, show that there is some diversity.  And you're right.  Nice try Jews and Christmas lights in your window.  Dear Jews, please try not to kill this one.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  So my house looks a little more Christmassy. 
[00:16:30]  Kind of happy about that.  I have a reason.  Got little stockings for our fireplace.  Really?  Yeah.  You're really being a fag.  I'm not being a fag.  It's just when, you know what happens?  You're getting domesticated.  You know, it usually ends up that Christmas goes by.  And then after the fact, you're like, I came and went and you know, like I hate the whole  thing with Christmas with the shopping and the presents and having to give, I like having  to give people stuff that you don't know what the hell they want. 
[00:17:00]  And it sounds like the old cliche.  I don't like the commercialization of it.  It's not that.  It's just, I really don't enjoy the forced things you have to do every year for Christmas.  But then once it passes and you did really nothing, it's kind of like, ah, you know,  I kind of missed out on a little bit.  So this year it's kind of cool, you know.  Our little house is kind of Christmassy.  You're walking around in a sweater and a pipe, admiring your work.  There it is, hon. 
[00:17:30]  I've got to call that chimney man so he could light a little U-log in that fireplace.  Yeah, that's me.  Oh, God.  Slippers.  Well, I could use this all year long.  Thank you, dear.  Are your slippers and your pipe waiting for you when you come through the door?  Yes, yes.  An old blue, my dog, is sitting there on the side for me to pat on the head.  Come here, boy.  Woof, woof.  It's a regular Norman Rockwell painting, my house. 
[00:18:00]  I have a wreath.  That's it.  You got a wreath?  Yeah.  Hey, there you go.  Corner store had wreaths.  I'm like, yeah, I'll take one.  Would you put it on your apartment door?  Nothing sadder than Christmas in an apartment.  Uh, no.  I spent years in Brooklyn in one.  Just over the fireplace that doesn't work.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that I had to find out the hard way.  Would you light a fire and almost kill yourself?  Oh, dude.  Probably one of the gayest things I've ever done.  You know Jay, our good friend Jay.  Jay from Framingham?  Yeah, Jay from Framingham. 
[00:18:30]  Now Jay from L.A., right?  Pasadena or something?  Uh, no, now he's in, uh, where is he?  He's up near, um, he's up near the comedy store, actually, up there on Sunset, I guess.  Oh, nice.  And, uh, you know, Jay came over.  Really good friend of ours and stuff, and we decide, uh, you know, to just, uh, you  know, mellow out and watch the, uh, the Survivor finale last year.  Uh-huh.  Dude, this is one of the gayest stories I'll ever tell in the air, okay?  It's already gearing up to be gay.  You're in second gay gear. 
[00:19:00]  It's beyond gay, I'm gonna admit it.  I'm not gay.  Of course.  But, uh, it's gonna be hard to defend the story, okay?  So...  I hope this doesn't go by the way where I sense it might be going.  What?  I just don't like this one.  Yeah, we'll send, I'm having a feeling, too.  Oh, it's awful.  It's awful.  I'm, uh, definitely throwing myself in the barrel here.  I, I meant to tell this story a long time ago, when I first started.  Sorry, I'm distracted by one of our old, uh, pals from WNAW on Channel 7 right now playing  a, a tambourine or something on some news story.  Yeah, it's a, it's a local, it's a, it's a local news, uh, program, and they're one of 
[00:19:30]  the, one of the radio stations in New York.  It's Scott and Todd, so you could, you could, you could just figure out how faggy this is,  and it's some stupid band, uh, singing a Christmas song, and they're showing it live on TV right  now, and, uh, there's Pat.  There's Pat.  Our old sales guy that used to go to our road shows and help us, uh, get girls naked,  and now he's, now he's up there just, just banging a stupid instrument on his, on his hand.  And warbling out some vocals.  You know it's gotta just be awful. 
[00:20:00]  So, uh, you know, Jay, uh, Jay was visiting, whatever, and, um, it was the Survivor finale,  and it was a cold, rainy night.  Ooh.  And, uh, we decided, you know, to get, you know, get some takeout, some cheese and crackers.  Wait a minute!  Crack open a bottle of wine.  I'm telling you.  Oh, God!  I'm telling you, it's gay crap.  You could stop right there.  Alright.  And it's already...  Alright, I guess I will.  ...really gay.  Do you wanna hear more or not?  Of course!  Alright. 
[00:20:30]  We go through the supermarket to get all this stuff.  We're planning just a mellow night, you know, in front of the TV to watch the Survivor finale,  okay?  Two men, some wine, an afghan.  Dude, trust me.  Cheese, crackers, no dried sausage, or did you bring that yourselves?  It's awful.  Shut up.  Yeah.  So, uh, we're going up and down the aisles and, uh, and I'm like, hey Jay, I got that,  I got a, I got a fireplace that I've never used, right?  So, so they got the door flames?  Yeah.  Not only do they have the door flame logs, by the way, after I tell the story, I will  not be, uh, uh, reading my email for, uh, two to three days, okay? 
[00:21:00]  Alright.  So, good luck trying to abuse me.  And I'm not reading any message boards, and I'm not even gonna answer the phones.  Oh, okay.  So, uh, we see the pile of door flame logs, but right next to it are java logs.  What is a java log?  Java logs are like door flame logs, but they give the, the, uh, the smell of coffee in your  apartment when you're burning them.  Are you kidding?  And I love my coffee, so I'm like, hey, let's try the java log.  Why not get a door flame and make some coffee? 
[00:21:30]  Why is my coffee spilled everywhere?  You sure it's not a java log?  She spilled my java log.  What the hell is this?  This is not what I ordered.  You bitch.  This is no, not even close to what I ordered.  Uh-oh.  Caffey Diva.  Look at this thing.  Look at that.  Wow.  It's filled up to the tippity top.  Look at it.  It's spilling all over the console.  Like there, I don't know if it was, if it's possible, but I think there's just too 
[00:22:00]  much liquid in here and it's now trying to escape.  Did one of the savage deli people that work in this fine city, one of those savage, uh,  uh, uh, Middle Easterns?  No, it's a, it's a, it's a, uh, Starbucks.  Dude, it doesn't look like Starbucks.  What is this?  I ordered a cappuccino.  Oh, you did?  A 2% cappuccino.  Sorry, I heard the grande skin thing.  What, did they put both in the cup?  No, I-  The thing is overflowing.  I over-latte-ed it, I guess.  Ah!  We'll go, uh, fix that.  I don't know what this is.  It's a coffee. 
[00:22:30]  But thank you for the effort.  I really appreciate it.  Hey, no problem.  Maybe he's got other things on his mind, like-  This is the new friendlier Opie.  Having sex with porn stars or something.  Alright, so-  How's that going?  Uh.  Still going?  Yeah, we've kind of moved on.  I'm banging other girls, she's banging hundreds of other guys.  Ooh!  It's in the past.  Aww.  Maybe next month I'll have an update for you.  Alright, sorry to hear that.  No, it's alright.  I'm here for the show.  Oh, yeah.  Fair enough.  Alright.  I like the new friendlier Opie. 
[00:23:00]  If someone spills your coffee, I pardon you.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  Anyway, so, uh, so I go, hey Jay, let's, uh, let's try the java logs.  So we, uh, we bring the java logs home with the cheese and crackers.  Ooh, all excited of the coffee smell.  And the survivor finale is about to begin with, uh, it was the season with, uh, what was his  name?  Rupert or whatever the hell his name was.  The guy with the beard.  The gay guy?  The gay guy?  That's like the first season, bro.  Oh, okay.  This is only like last year.  I watched the first season.  That was about it. 
[00:23:30]  Alright, so, uh, so I start the fire, we open up the wine, we got, uh, some takeouts,  some cheese and crackers, survivors about to start, fires starting to crackle, smelling  the, smelling the nice smell of java.  Dude, this is awful!  I'm telling you, I know it's awful, but you know Jay, so it's not, it's not, well,  whatever, I'm not even going to try to explain because it does sound awful.  It sounds awful, I understand.  Alright, so it sounds awful.  It sounds awful.  Sonny robbing the bank to get Leona's sex change wasn't as gay as this.  I know, so, so then, you know, it's an icy, rainy night out, you know, I'm like, Jay, 
[00:24:00]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna put some sweats on and get comfortable, you know?  Oh, jeez!  Oh, I know.  It just keeps going!  So I don't have sweats, I have some flannel PJs on, I'm like, well, no one's gonna, this  is the key to the story, I'm like, ah, no one's gonna see me, it's just Jay, I've  known him forever.  Yeah.  Ant's known him forever, look how I'm like, help.  Sure.  I'm just praying that you're gonna help me out a little bit here, but.  I've always been completely dressed around Jay. 
[00:24:30]  Well, so have I, but I just happen to have flannel PJs on.  Alright.  The lights flowing, and Survivor's on, and.  Cheese and crackers.  Cheese and crackers, and the java log.  Crackling java log.  And all of a sudden, Jay's like, hey, is it getting smoky in here, or is it my imagination?  I'm like, what?  So I look in the distance, and you can kind of just see the smoke.  Little haze.  Little haze up high, right?  Uh oh.  So I'm like, oh my god, was the flume open, closed?  What the F, right?  So I, you know, I opened it or closed it, I don't know what I did to hopefully get this smoke 
[00:25:00]  out, because obviously something's not working right.  Uh huh.  So whatever I did made it so much worse.  So now the smoke is just pouring out of the fireplace into my apartment.  Now it's getting pretty bad.  It's getting serious.  Uh oh.  So then I decide, oh, fuck.  So I decided to try to take the door flame log and throw it out my backyard.  And as I'm trying to get it out of the fireplace, the whole thing explodes, making more fire  and smoke, you know?  What do you mean? 
[00:25:30]  Like, did a crackle thing?  Yeah, it's all chemical, so it kind of just fell apart and now it's just like, now it's  flaming, alright?  Yeah, so is the situation around your apartment.  Dude, wait for the punchline.  So I'm like, Jay, holy crap, now we got a problem.  Now the smoke is just flying out of the fireplace, dark and thick and going right up to the  ceiling.  I mean, it is bad.  No exaggeration.  So now I open all the windows, open my back door to my outdoor part there.  I'm just hearing jokes and jokes with every word.  Oh, I know. 
[00:26:00]  I opened my back door.  It just gets big, black and thick.  Right.  You know, you're saying things that just conjure an image.  If it wasn't so early in LA, we'd have to get Jay on the phone.  Maybe we'll get him on the phone tomorrow.  So I'm like, Jay, there's a fan downstairs, go get it.  So he grabs the fan, the windows are open, it's freezing out, the door's open.  Now we got the fan, now we're just blowing all this black dark smoke out of the apartment,  right?  Right.  And I'm like, oh my God, what are we going to do? 
[00:26:30]  Now we're just running around trying to figure this out because I can't get the door flame  out, right?  So all of a sudden I'm downstairs, I forgot, trying to find another fan or something.  And all of a sudden, do, do, do, do, do, banging on the door really hard.  Jay's like, from upstairs, he goes, should I get that?  I'm like, yeah, I guess, I don't know who's stopping by, but yeah, grab it, right?  So it opens up the door, the fire department, there you go.  Yeah.  But they weren't real firemen, they were Chippendales dancers. 
[00:27:00]  And they throw up their helmets.  Dude.  So the fire department comes barging in in full gear with the oxygen on, the mask, everything.  I mean, everything.  Wow.  Isn't that amazing that the people actually in the apartment weren't the ones that called?  It got that bad?  That bad?  No, it was really bad.  You know, I'm not kidding.  Obviously the neighbors ratted me out.  Yeah.  Turns out, you know, I went out the front door and there were like three or four fire trucks 
[00:27:30]  on my block, closed off the whole street.  They thought there was just a massive fire going on because of the smoke.  Just two guys eating some cheese and crackers.  So there's three or four fire department guys, you know, in full gear that looked like  they just walked off one of those stupid calendars they sell every year.  No, just big, tough, burly guys in there.  Just saying.  Buff.  Shut up.  And there I am in my PJs, Anthony.  A couple glasses of wine on the, you know, near the couch. 
[00:28:00]  It looks real bad for you.  It looks horrendous.  Because remember, going back in the story, I said that I didn't think anyone was going  to see me this way.  Of course.  So you do things when you don't think.  You know what I mean?  You're like, yeah, whatever.  Who's really going to see me?  So there's three or four guys in there.  And we're looking just really bad and faggy.  And right next to my fire places, there's a picture of Kurt Cobain in makeup.  I'm sure that didn't help the situation, right?  So all of a sudden, they're staring at the apartment. 
[00:28:30]  They see it's a door flame log, right?  And Jay and I, at this point, are trying to look tough.  Like, it was a door flame log, but we got it under control, sir, or whatever, you know?  Yeah.  And they're on their walkie-talkies.  Like, ah, God, it's just a 202 or whatever they say.  202 is fire in a fag's apartment.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what Jay said, you know?  It's gotta be.  Yeah, you boys have fun now.  Yeah, because they're on their walkie, ah, it's only a 202, you know, sorry, Jesus.  And they're all pissed off because they were ready to, like, you know, do some serious firefighting, 
[00:29:00]  you know?  Of course.  And they walk out of the apartment, and Jay and I look at each other like, holy S, how  bad does this look, you know?  Did anyone recognize you?  No.  Because do you understand how awful that would be?  Oh, no.  And go, dude, I went to Opie's apartment.  Yeah, no.  A fire incident.  No.  And apparently he's a gay man.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Relax on that.  But, yeah, but, you know, they thought they were gonna see some really cool shit, and  instead it was like, you know, me and PJs, a little glass of wine on the side there, and 
[00:29:30]  a door of flame fire out of control.  Looks bad.  It was awful.  What did they do?  Anything?  Did they put the log out?  Well, I forgot.  At this point, I guess, you know, we got the log on.  I started, like, just smashing the thing until, you know, it kind of, whatever, but,  yeah, and they were so bummed out, and they just walk out of the park, and the last guy  just slams the door shut, and I'm like, oh, God, dude, we look like the biggest fags  right now.  Well, I understand the worst part wasn't even the fire.  It was at the end of the night, Jay felt fat. 
[00:30:00]  He's complaining the cheese and crackers go right to his thighs.  Oh, I should just rub these on my midsection.  Chief.  Chief.  Yeah, but the best part was on the walkie-talkie.  Ah, it's just a 2-0-2.  We'll be back at the firehouse in about five minutes.  Just a couple of flamers here with a door of flame.  Nothing to worry about. 
[00:30:30]  Just a couple of fags.  We bailed them out.  We'll be back at the firehouse.  Yeah, remember how when we left, we slid down the pole?  Yeah, they're doing the same thing here in the department.  2-0-2.  Or whatever, whatever the code was, but we knew that code was something really awful  for the guys back at the firehouse.  It was one number off from a gerbil incident.  Yeah.  UConn the trucker, what's up, UConn?  What's shaking, guys?  What do you got, brother man? 
[00:31:00]  Hey, I want to know when you went to a grocery store if you picked up a bag of marshmallows  and it's in the car.  I'm trying to recreate the old fraternity scene.  Thank you.  Rich and Brooklyn, what do you have?  O-B-N-J.  Shit digs.  See, you try to share on the show.  There's no sharing here.  Not in this forum.  They're going to rip you to pieces.  All right, now we've got to get Jay on the phone.  We'll get him on tomorrow. 
[00:31:30]  Are you going to be mad if you call and another man answers?  Shut up.  Hi, Jay?  No, this is Bruce.  Oh, did I dial the right number?  Is Jay there?  Yes, he's right here.  He can't come to the phone.  He's got a mouth full of cheese and crackers.  Hey, thanks for that Java log suggestion.  Yeah, we really enjoy the Java log.  Jay, you want to turn over the Java log?  It's kind of smoking a bit.  We're just sitting, drinking a little wine and watching Survivor. 
[00:32:00]  Ooh, it's getting a little smoky in here.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What an incident.  Scott in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, maybe you need to get a chimney sweep to come out there and ram a big black pole  down your chimney shoes.  It's going to be a long day.  You say you didn't get it fixed?  No, I haven't used the fireplace since.  The chimney obviously has to be swept out.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  But Flea Man from CringeHumor.net, what's up?  Hey, I just want to say that I'm a cashier at a local A&P, and now on the bag of Duraflame,  it says, don't leave unattended when having wine and cheese with another man in P.J.  A little disclaimer on that thing now, huh?  A Java log.  Did it smell like coffee?  A little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  So that was...  I do have another incident.  Jesus.  Thank God.  Well, maybe if I tell this other story, it'll take the gay out of that story. 
[00:33:00]  Give it a whirl.  All right.  So does it involve Matthew Shepard and a conviction?  Yeah, well, we weren't working for two years, right?  And I wasn't going to spend winter in New York.  I mean, duh.  No, it's cold.  So I was just traveling everywhere.  This is like the first winter I think we're going to have to deal with in three seasons,  right, if you figure it out?  Yeah.  So, I mean, I was going down to Florida, Arizona, California, anywhere warm. 
[00:33:30]  Warm places.  Dallas, I went in a couple times.  And every once in a while, I'd come back to New York and, you know, just check out the  New York apartment, make sure it's okay and stuff.  And, you know, maybe there was like a party to go to or a comedy show, whatever.  So I would pop into New York City every once in a while.  And I would...  Because I wasn't there, I kept the heat completely off.  Yeah.  I mean, completely off, which you know where this story's going, obviously.  Uh-oh.  Completely off.  And so I come back to New York, and it was pretty much like yesterday, like 15, 17 degrees 
[00:34:00]  out, right?  So I'm getting ready to...  I forgot where I was going, but I was getting ready.  And I turn up all the heat when I first got there.  It's going to take a while.  And I'm like, you know, while the heat's, you know, cranking up, I'll take a hot shower,  you know?  So I'm taking a really hot shower, and all of a sudden, the water just turns ice cold.  I mean, ice cold.  The hot water is done.  And I'm like, what the F?  So I get out of the shower, you know, throw a towel on, whatever. 
[00:34:30]  And I'm by myself.  Okay, you should make that clear.  I actually did throw some clothes on.  No, I didn't throw some clothes on at that point.  So I walk out of the bathroom, and I'm like, what is going on?  What happened to the hot water?  Hot water.  And at this point, you know my apartment, you know where my bathroom is, and then there's  like the living room, and then there's the kitchen, kind of all one long thing.  One line, yes.  All right, so in the distance is the kitchen, and I see a river of water coming from the  kitchen.  Not a little, dude.  Not a little. 
[00:35:00]  Like a river.  I'm like, holy S.  Pipe burst, obviously.  So I quickly throw some clothes on.  I have a landlord that can't be bothered, who changes his numbers.  I can't even get a hold of my landlord if I wanted to.  Notorious Manhattan landlord.  Oh, yeah.  They are the worst.  Oh, yeah.  All they want is the first rent, deposit, and make sure you give them rent money.  Give them their money, and that's it.  I mean, I had his number originally, but it gets to the point everyone bothers him.  He just changes his number.  He could care less.  There you go. 
[00:35:30]  He's like leasing the apartment.  He has some weird deal.  He's just like the leasing agent.  It's typical.  He doesn't officially own the building, but he takes care of everything for the owner  who's in Florida and just gives him money.  It's a weird situation.  So I have just a raging river coming from the kitchen, going across my living room toward  my big TV.  Oh, it was coming in from the ... I thought maybe it was going out the back door or something.  Oh, I wish.  No, no.  It was coming right from the kitchen, through the living room, and all the way down the 
[00:36:00]  stairs, right?  Thank God no furniture could have been ruined.  Your lack of furniture.  I know.  I understand.  You lost a cup and two kernels of popcorn.  You see a pretzel bowl floating, and that's it.  Remember the flood of 03?  It did $11 worth of damage in my home.  So it's really, really bad.  I mean, really bad.  I don't know how to turn off the water in my apartment building, and I don't know ... I  don't have a number for the landlord, so I'm calling the super who finally got a hold 
[00:36:30]  of a friend of the landlord who's going to be there in 20 minutes, because he's dealing  with another ... 20 minutes, a lot of water could pour in.  Yeah, because he's dealing with another piper somewhere else, because I guess the pipes  are bursting all over Manhattan this particular week.  So I panic.  I'm like, 20 minutes, and I don't know how to shut off the water.  You've seen my creepy basement.  I mean, there's no lights down there, and it's all just junk from other tenants that  lived there for the last, who knows, 50 years.  Stuff they left there.  Yeah, that never cleared out their stuff. 
[00:37:00]  So even if you knew where to go, you'd have to climb over stuff.  No clue.  I had no clue where it was.  So I just panic.  I'm like, 9-1-1, man.  Oh, jeez.  9-1-1.  My apartment is literally flooding out, okay?  I mean, the water is just like a river pouring down the stairs, and then to that corner of  my living room, okay, near my TV.  And I'm watching the water rise, especially downstairs in the basement, up near the outlets.  Oh, yeah, that's interesting.  So I'm like, oh, maybe I might get electrocuted here. 
[00:37:30]  So I didn't know what to do, so I called 9-1-1.  And then I did quickly throw clothes on for this one.  So to make a long story short, the police show up, and they pound down the door just  like the fire department from the last story.  That's what they do.  So they come charging in, like two or three of them.  They're assessing the situation, pipe burst, water.  At this point, I'm downstairs in the basement looking up.  It's like my computer room slash guest room, and I'm watching the ceiling is now getting 
[00:38:00]  ready to collapse.  Oh, the water's coming down from the floor and then hanging in the ceiling?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's getting really bad.  And while I'm doing that with the cops all around me, and this is what reminded me of  the story, all of a sudden one of them looks at me and goes, holy S.  You're Opie from Opie and Anthony, aren't you?  I heard you guys are going back on the radio in Connecticut.  Is that true?  I'm like, dude, I will talk about radio.  I'll sign whatever you want.  I'll take pictures.  But take care of the situation.  Help me turn off the fucking water, you know? 
[00:38:30]  Where was it, downstairs?  Yeah, in the creepy basement.  It was in the creepy basement.  Yeah, one of the landlord's buddies finally figured that part out.  But then they're like, yeah, yeah, no problem.  Yeah, yeah, no problem.  But so what is the deal?  Whatever happened with you and Anthony?  And what's Anthony doing?  He wants to know all about you, all about me, the show, when we're coming back.  I'm like, and I start cursing at the guy.  I'm like, dude, just turn off the effing water and I'll talk about all this stuff.  And the water is literally, you know, up to our ankles at this point. 
[00:39:00]  And then at that moment, like right on cue, the ceiling collapses.  And then the water is now just pouring from the ceiling.  Into your basement.  Into my basement, missing my computer by literally six inches.  Like it's a waterfall of water right in front of my computer screen.  Shouldn't have turned the heat off, my friend.  Obviously.  Yeah.  And then it turns out because, you know, the landlord could care less.  It was behind like the dishwasher, I guess.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  And the pipe was exposed right to the brick with no insulation.  You know, it's outside, brick, pipe.  Yeah.  That's it.  But another incident where, you know, someone is barging into the apartment.  Emergency services.  And this time, they could care less about the situation.  They just want to know what was going on with you and I.  At least you didn't have a man in there.  No, I didn't have a little axe on that.  Just, I don't know, the J thing is...  I understand.  That didn't help the J thing?  Not at all. 
[00:40:00]  This is another instance where you needed a real man to come help.  Helpless Opie, standing on a chair.  Help!  There's a mouse in the house.  All right.  Third story.  I have a Polish maid that I bang on regularly.  Yeah, there you go.  It comes with a fee.  No?  Anyone?  Help me?  Pleased to be having sex with me.  Opie has a thing for men in uniform.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  People are really hammering you.  Yeah.  Somebody sent this in.  Nick from Long Island.  Opie, you got lucky.  This is about the first story.  Imagine if you invited Steve C over.  It would have been like a scene at a backdraft.  Well, there you have it.  A couple of little stories to start the show today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it was just amazing.  I mean, NYPD, they've seen it all.  They don't care, you know?  And I'm like, dude, come on.  Help me out.  Just figure out how to turn off this water.  They're hardcore.  And I'll answer any question you have.  They hate calls where they have to like, oh, I got to find a valve. 
[00:41:00]  They'd rather be, you know, wrapping people over their head with their nightsticks and  shooting people.  Yeah.  Some real action.  That's true.  Mike in Kansas.  What's up?  I'm in an Opie's old first story there.  Yeah.  The only thing that would have made it any gear if they'd have both whipped their hogs  out and just on the log put it out.  But quick, Jay, we have to put the log out.  Zip.  This is going to be a long day.  Joe and Callie, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if the water damaged your liberator over there. 
[00:41:30]  You asked.  Liberators floating around.  Oh, big rubber ass.  I had to jump floating.  I had to jump on the liberator to, you know, stay above water.  Help me.  Like they do in the flood country.  Hold on, Jay.  Hold on.  Opie's floating on the liberator.  There's only room for one.  Jay slowly disappears into the basement. 
[00:42:00]  Jay was part of the fire story, not the flood story.  Combining the two.  Bob in Jamestown, what's up?  Hi.  My name's Opie and I've got a funny, funny story for you.  Punch it out.  Did I say it was a funny story?  No.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  I think so.  I did.  That was a huge mistake.  Yeah.  Well, that's what you get in an apartment.  I don't like dealing with people anymore.  I had that stupid apartment in Brooklyn and we were talking at first about Christmas  and decorating the house for Christmas and stuff and it's the first house I've had in 
[00:42:30]  a while, you know?  And I had that apartment and I was just saying how sad it is to have a Christmas in an apartment  because people try to decorate their front door.  You walk into the hallway and you just see like their front door.  Oh, look.  It's wrapped like a present.  Yeah.  They put the wrapping paper and the bow on it and stuff.  It's still an apartment.  It doesn't have that Christmassy feel.  They got to deal with other people's filth.  Roaches.  No matter how clean you try to keep it, there's roaches running around.  Little Christmas roaches. 
[00:43:00]  You don't need it.  That's why I like a house open.  You don't have to worry about other people breaking pipes and having water pour into  your apartment or setting Java logs on fire so you got to call the fire department.  Dude, I was the buzzkill for the whole building though because I forgot to tell you this part.  It took, I don't know, like two days to fix the water and it was the middle of winter  and it was a really bad cold spell so I'm sure everyone really wanted their hot water  for some hot showers.  They had to turn off the water in the whole building for like two days. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, they ain't gonna get it.  And everyone else that lives in that building were just giving me the dirtiest looks like  you son of a bitch.  I had some woman living downstairs from me in my apartment.  It's the middle of August.  It's just hotter than hell.  And she knocks on my door and she's pissed off that my air conditioner is dripping on  her air conditioner down below and going like making a loud banging noise on there and wants 
[00:44:00]  me to, you know, what, crawl out on the ledge and fix it or turn the air conditioner off in  August.  I was like, yeah, well, I go, there's people put like pads on top of theirs or something  to keep the drips from annoying them.  Work on it.  So I'm not doing anything.  I hate dealing with people.  I think we went into that a little yesterday.  Yeah.  I really have become just, I can't stand dealing with people.  But that would drive me nuts if I'm hearing the drips on top of my air conditioner. 
[00:44:30]  Then get a mat or something or some AstroTurf and pop it on top so it's not hitting the tin.  Because, what am I going to do?  Turn it off in that sweltering crap box of an apartment?  No.  It's annoying you, the drip?  Fix it.  Paul from Massachusetts.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, Opie, I just wanted to know if it was monster rain coming down through your ceiling  there.  Exactly, Jimmy.  What? 
[00:45:00]  I mean, yeah, I can't defend my gay story but, you know, it's not as gay as your story.  Yeah, it is.  I was not.  I was just young.  I wasn't, I was a little boy.  Jimmy Robinson told me to do something and I didn't.  I wasn't curled up on a couch with another, my life partner.  I wasn't curled up on a couch.  Under the porch with some cheese and crackers.  Listen to the replay, I was not curled up on a couch.  I bet you the biggest part of the smoke was that it stained your copy of chicken soup for  the soul. 
[00:45:30]  Chicken soup for the colon.  Anthony, I'm going to try to move on.  Yeah.  We're big news.  Big, big news.  It's becoming bigger and bigger by the day.  Just like we told everyone.  That's what's kind of exciting about this when we share this with our faithful listeners.  Anthony, you want to explain what's happened for the people that might have turned on their  XM satellite radios overnight?  We're being heard in Syracuse.  On a commercial radio station.  That's really big news. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  Terrestrial radio, they call it.  Right.  Fareed, our buddy over there at Citadel Broadcasting, he decided it would be a good thing to put  us on the air.  See?  Kind of breaking the ice.  Getting us back on broadcast radio.  And all the commercial radio broadcasters out there thought Anthony and I were completely  finished after the couple allegedly had sex at St. Pat's Cathedral.  Yeah.  They're like, they'll never work in this town again. 
[00:46:30]  That old gag.  And actually, we could have worked in commercial radio right from the start, but well, not  right from the start after our contract ended.  That was the biggest problem.  But we decided to do the satellite radio thing to have a lot more freedom.  Yeah.  And we always said that if it made sense, we'd go back to commercial radio.  A lot of people are panicking and paranoid.  They're thinking that our show on satellite radio is going to change.  Not at all.  Don't worry about it.  Absolutely not at all.  Enjoy the ride.  If there's a commercial radio station out there that wants to take our satellite radio 
[00:47:00]  show and make it friendly for commercial radio, great.  Yeah.  Maybe they're still going to miss a lot of great stuff that we do on satellite radio.  Yeah.  So if you bought the XM satellite radio, you made the right decision.  Okay?  Don't sweat it.  So we told all our listeners, I guess, Monday, that we had all these secret meetings Friday  here in Manhattan, and it went down, and it's getting more gooder every day.  I don't know what they're playing in Syracuse.  I think they're playing the show from yesterday, today. 
[00:47:30]  Is that how they're working?  I think they're a day behind.  What they're doing is they're taking our XM satellite radio show, and then they're listening  to the whole thing and cleaning it up and making it work for their radio station.  Because they still have to play a lot of commercials and all that.  Mm-hmm.  If you've noticed, we've already talked for like 45, 50 minutes straight here.  Yeah.  That you just can't do that on commercial radio anymore.  You have to break every 20 minutes, every 15 minutes usually.  So they listen to it, and then whatever is unacceptable for broadcast radio, they cut  that out and replace it with commercials.  Right.  So the news stories are building and building by the day, just like we told you. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  A little piece here, a little piece there, a little headline, and now it's starting to spread  like we told you what.  Our good friend, our old pal in Boston, Dean Johnson, who writes the radio column for  the Boston Hurl.  Dean.  He has jumped on, Anthony.  Hotline.  Opie and Anthony open back door to airwaves.  I see a common thread through today's show.  Well, for the first hour anyway.  Geez.  And he writes, will Opie and Anthony sneak back to the Boston Airwaves someday? 
[00:48:30]  The Shock Jocks recently signed a deal with the XM Satellite Radio Network.  But for the next two weeks, listeners of WAQX-FM in Syracuse also will be able to listen  to the duo, real names, Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia, do their morning shtick.  It's the first time ONA have been on traditional radio since August 2002, when they were suspended  for a show that allegedly featured a live sex act in New York's St. Pat's Cathedral.  The WAQX program will be a carefully censored version of the previous morning's XM show. 
[00:49:00]  Careful.  Very carefully censored.  Careful.  That's why you guys in XM Satellite Radio land, don't worry about it.  Nothing's going to change.  Relax.  The two-week run is an experiment.  It could lead to XM syndicating the boys to other traditional radio stations.  Maybe even one here in the hub.  Ah.  Maybe.  Could we be making another comeback to Boston radio, Anthony?  How many would this make?  I don't know.  This would be the third time, I think.  Third? 
[00:49:30]  Third time's a charm.  So, we have that one.  And then we have, Opie and Anthony bounce from ground to space to ground.  We did?  I don't even know what paper this is from, but basically it says, an interesting twist  in the saga of Opie and Anthony and Howard and Michael Powell.  Opie and Anthony are shock jocks who were tossed off their terrestrial radio program  for an incident involving a church and one each member of each gender.  Oh, okay.  XM signed them up to broadcast as part of a premium package of edgier content. 
[00:50:00]  And he does write, of edgier content.  Satellite digital radio companies are not limited by AM, FM, TV decency laws because they're a subscription service  that requires too much choice to be by accident.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Even further, O&A are on a premium upgrade, making their speech very hard to find unless  you really want it.  But O&A are back on the radio dial, specifically at Syracuse's WAQX.  Man, this station is getting a lot of attention and a lot of press.  Certainly is.  Part of the Citadel media collection of stations. 
[00:50:30]  And XM, along with O&A's agent, are looking at other deals to put O&A on the ground as  well as in the sky.  Super Agent Bob Eatman?  He's not as super these days.  This heats up the skies and ground with Howard Stern's upcoming January 1st, 2006 move  to Sirius.  XM may sneakily bring the sanitized overnight version of O&A onto stations that are concerned  about both fines for indecency and losing Stern's audience, Anthony.  Ooh.  The O&A show is cleaned up overnight, so it's just slightly less fresh, but there won't 
[00:51:00]  be any surprises either.  And then it says, I tried to find a picture of Opie and Anthony to illustrate the story,  but they apparently don't have any good photos of themselves at XM or anywhere on the net.  Just a strange caricature.  So enjoy this photo of the Cambridge Soundworks play doc for XM instead.  What the hell?  Is this someone's just blog?  I thought this was like a real newspaper.  Is that a news story?  Well, they did take those stupid publicity photos when we first signed with XM and we 
[00:51:30]  hate them.  Photoshopped yours.  They put awful makeup on us and then, yeah, they didn't like my face in one of the shots  and they loved Anthony because he was given the eyebrow.  Yes.  So they decided to Photoshop like other features from another shot of my face and throw it  on this shot.  Oh, it was weird.  It's just horrendous.  My neck is like a giraffe neck because they didn't match up the necks at all.  And then they...  We had the Ronald Reagan makeup on.  Come on.  It is.  And then they have my eyes wide open and me smiling at the same time, which is impossible 
[00:52:00]  to do.  Try it at home and see how you look in the mirror.  It's impossible.  Freakish.  But they decided my eyes needed to be open a little more and I needed more of a smile.  Yeah.  Instead of just taking another shot that we took that day, they took hundreds of shots.  Yeah.  But why would XM do anything the right way, right?  Please.  Don't even.  We'll get into that a little later.  Don't even get me started.  And then finally...  Vegas is going to be great via Alaska.  Where are we...  How many stop-offs do we have? 
[00:52:30]  We'll get into that a second.  And then a third article on this whole move back to commercial radio, Anthony.  Now available on terrestrial Opie and Anthony.  Since Citadel Active Rock WAQX, Syracuse began airing Opie and Anthony in morning drive  on December 20th, XM Satellite Radio has been fielding calls from other terrestrial stations  inquiring about the pair's availability.  This is happening like crazy, Anthony.  We didn't expect this, but it's happening like crazy.  So we've really got to figure out what the hell is going to go on in the future. 
[00:53:00]  All it needed was someone to break the ice like that.  Throw us on once.  Right.  Because you know how it is.  Then the other stations and companies go,  Oh!  Right.  They're on?  The world didn't end?  Right.  There's crap out there.  How pissed off is Howard right now?  He's trying to enjoy his little vacation and we just ruined it for him.  Absolutely ruined it.  Having a drink out of a coconut.  Having his girlfriend rubbing the suntan lotion on his back.  I've been out of the loop.  Let me see the news. 
[00:53:30]  Yoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  We love it.  He made our life a living hell when we worked for the same company.  We're just returning the favor.  XM Executive VP of Programming ELO tells Billboard Radio...  It doesn't say ELO.  Eric Logan.  Okay.  A.K.A. ELO tells Billboard Radio Monitor that XM is evaluating that market on a case-by-case basis.  And Bob Eatman, the personalities agent, says he and XM are very interested in expanding the base and brand of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:54:00]  I don't like the fact that they put Bob Eatman and personality in the same sentence.  He really is a dullard.  He's the worst.  That's what he does.  When he goes into negotiations, he wears the people down with his dullness.  They're just like, all right, look, take the money.  Just stop.  Fine.  I'll write it down the way you want it.  Just please leave this room putting me to sleep.  And take your creepy brother with you. 
[00:54:30]  Jesus, Opie!  Well, maybe if the guy would work a little harder for us, we wouldn't be bitching about him.  The decision to run the stars of XM Premium's high-voltage channel in place of Howard Stern while he is on vacation.  I just know how this works.  I just know how awful it is when you're on vacation trying to enjoy yourself and something happens back in New York.  Especially us.  It just makes it that much worse for him. 
[00:55:00]  He'd be pissed, believe me, if it was anybody doing this.  But the fact that it's us, just because he can't stand us.  Yeah, I know.  He is obsessed with hating us and has been since we got to New York and started becoming popular.  And just keep ignoring us, Howard.  Yeah.  Just see where that gets you.  Mm-hmm.  He was all brave with bad-mouthing us when we were off the air, when we got the boot out of there.  And for two years, oh, any time we came up in the news or something would happen with us, he'd be right there bashing us. 
[00:55:30]  Then we get back on the air, we start getting a little more attention, and he clams up, does all his work, tries to do it behind the scenes.  Good luck.  Have fun on your vacation.  Yeah, exactly.  Remember when we weren't even allowed in the same room at the MTV Music Awards?  Yeah.  Yep.  MTV Music Awards.  We're working for Viacom.  We're working for the radio division.  We're a big happy family. 
[00:56:00]  We're just huge in afternoon drive in all these cities.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, crazy.  And then we get invited to the MTV Music Awards that Viacom throws, and they put us on the red carpet in a nice position.  We had a really nice day.  And then we're like, all right, well, time for the show.  Let's go to the Viacom VIP room or booth or whatever they had, right?  Yeah.  They had a whole room.  It was a big room that they had. 
[00:56:30]  And I'm not kidding you.  At this point, we're pretty much the second biggest radio show they have.  Yes.  Right?  And then I miss.  So I would have to say we're the second biggest show in the radio division.  So we go to the door.  We're like, hey, Opie and Anthony, we're going to come in.  Mel's in there and Tony and everybody else.  Yeah.  We weren't even going to hang out there, but we figured we might as well make an appearance.  I just want to get some of them shrimps.  Right.  And then we'll take our seats and enjoy the show and maybe hit the bar and hang out with 
[00:57:00]  some of them.  Watch the rappers all smoke pot.  Which we did.  That was unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  And then Ben, you know, Mr. Socialite, is introducing Buster Rhymes to Fatboy Slim.  We thought there was going to be a project that came out of that, but it never happened.  Oh, damn.  And then what?  Sum 41 is hanging out with supermodels and they were underage so we're getting them drinks.  Remember that?  DMX, yeah.  We had to buy them beers.  DMX was smoking weed. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  Oh, and weed.  He was smoking one of those blunts.  Big fatty.  Oh, yeah.  That was the best part of the VMAs, that downstairs bar at the Met.  You couldn't even see.  It looked like Opie's apartment after a Java log accident.  It was just smoky, thick, and black.  Yeah, so we go to the door to be let into the VIP room.  This is just one incident why we think Howard's the biggest douchebag.  Yep, there is.  And we try to get in because we work for the same company, thinking nothing of it. 
[00:58:00]  Like, all right, we'll go in and we know everybody.  We'll say hi, right?  The doorman actually says that we can't go in.  No.  That they literally left our names at the door for this guy saying, look, you can't go in there.  Make sure Opie and Anthony do not go in this room.  We weren't allowed to be within a certain radius of Howard.  And we found out later, got to protect someone's identity, but it was told to us that this was something that Howard demanded.  Yep. 
[00:58:30]  Another one of these things that Howard demanded.  And then Mel folded like a cheap tan and said, you know, tough shit, you guys can't come in here.  We're working for the company.  Mel's just got his head buried in his ass.  We're working for the company.  Yeah.  So then we're standing out there like, you're kidding, right?  You're kidding, right?  No, I'm not kidding at all.  You guys are not allowed in here.  Thank you.  And then they basically said, could you please move away from the door?  Yeah.  And please don't stand here.  And you're wondering why we were bitter towards some of these old people like John Sykes, 
[00:59:00]  who didn't know what the F he was doing when he ran the place.  He's getting his resume in order.  Yes, he is.  Read in the paper, what, yesterday?  So, you know.  Just looking for an out on his contract.  Throw him out the door.  No, they're just waiting for it to expire.  Worthless.  It's going to be really soon.  Really soon.  That's a good idea.  Have a VH1 guy come in and run your radio division.  Yeah.  It's just like VH1, only without the pictures.  Jackass.  What a bomb.  Remember when he ran away from me at the buffet line? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Because I was ready to get in his face.  And I swear to God, next time I see him, there will be a problem.  Because that guy pretty much ruined Anthony and I's careers because he was so incompetent.  Absolutely incompetent.  Absolutely incompetent.  We should not have been fired for the Sex for Sam thing.  Of course not.  A lot of people think it was awful and morally wrong.  What?  Whatever.  If anyone had a backbone in that company at the time.  But it was a clean radio show.  But this guy had no experience running a radio division.  And, you know, he's telling us we're going to be okay, we're going to be okay. 
[01:00:00]  And then the freaking guy doesn't even answer our calls and just hangs us out there to dry, just hangs us out.  You know who could have handled that situation?  Joel Hollander.  That's right.  COO of Viacom.  Well, he's in charge now.  Of Infinity.  And, you know.  Oh, he'll be the big boss.  And he's the guy that would have had some backbone and been able to settle his people down and go,  Look, let's sit it out.  We'll just ride this out.  Don't worry about it so much.  And then, you know, you keep us there. 
[01:00:30]  You don't waste millions and millions and millions of dollars at these stations that threw us off the air.  Take huge losses.  You sit there and suck it up.  Yeah.  Like Sykes.  Let them go.  Fire them.  Yeah, because he didn't really understand the show to begin with.  Well, yeah, that was a good move, huh, John?  Huh?  Yeah.  The company lost millions and millions and millions of dollars and they're all staring at you, saying,  You stink.  You stink.  Fast forward years ahead at WNEW now. 
[01:01:00]  You know?  It's years now.  Hey, baby.  What's happening?  Hey, what's happening?  Frankie Blue, baby.  Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue, baby.  Frankie Blue, baby.  Frankie Blue, baby.  We're gonna...  We're gonna...  Hey, listener.  To...  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Didn't he say your show was bad for kids?  Yeah.  I remember back then, even when you guys were still on the air, John Sykes said your show  was bad for kids.  Yeah, I didn't know we were on Radio Disney, that we had to be...  He wanted... 
[01:01:30]  Kid friendly.  Specifically, he didn't...  Wow.  Yeah, specifically, he didn't get...  No, that's all right.  I'm trying to find a spoon.  Can you find a spoon in there?  All right.  Boss wants a spoon, Eric.  I gotta mix my coffee.  You got like a plastic thing over there?  Specifically, he didn't like the Wow promotion.  Yeah.  Wow.  Best radio promotion of all time.  It's been...  And that's not coming from me.  It's been written up in the trade.  It's like one of the greatest things ever invented because it just...  It gets the name out there.  It gets the name out and it gets the exposure for the radio show.  Easily identifiable.  Sure. 
[01:02:00]  He didn't get that and a lot of other things.  So when, you know, we effed up, it was a good excuse to get rid of us.  And now he, you know...  He suffered for it, obviously.  It wrecked his whole career because it showed how incompetent he really was.  Yep.  So we're at the Dennis Leary Roast and we're at the buffet.  He's literally right next to me.  And he saw me and his face turned white, Anthony.  He was still a pussy and a wimp.  Yeah.  Didn't confront me.  Didn't say hi.  Didn't say anything.  He took his food and bolted. 
[01:02:30]  Absolutely bolted.  You saw it, Jimmy.  I'm not exaggerating.  Yeah, he really did.  He did hightail it out of there.  He hightailed it right out of there.  What a wimp.  He's a boob.  I mean, you're supposed to be the boss if you're gonna...  You know, alright.  If that's your decision, you're gonna let Anthony and I loose?  Fine.  Why don't you say it to our face?  I called you enough.  I called you every day while I was going down.  Many times.  At least Mel seems like he would say something to your face.  He doesn't seem like he would hide and be afraid to confront somebody. 
[01:03:00]  Well, I respect Mel as far as that goes.  You know, you might not agree with what he has to say, but at least he'll say it right to your face.  Might not.  Yeah.  Unless you're a cop.  You won't agree with what he says.  Yeah.  Ugh.  That guy.  What a pain in the ass he is to work for.  Oh my God.  The poor general managers of the company.  They gotta answer to him.  And he's like the guy that you ask the questions and there's never a right answer.  So you just completely...  You screw yourself.  You give yourself more rope for him to hang you with. 
[01:03:30]  It's the worst thing sitting in a meeting with that guy.  Especially when you're in trouble.  Yeah.  You sit at that desk.  He makes you wait.  And then he comes in and sits down and just presents you with a question that is unanswerable.  He's all intimidating because he's, you know, huge in business and...  Oh, it's awful dealing with him.  Yeah.  Have fun over there at the doggy company.  Unless you're a senator, then you can just watch him grovel.  That's true.  That was a very effective appearance.  We didn't know.  That was true. 
[01:04:00]  He looked really bad at those Senate hearings for indecency that they held in Washington.  He just threw the NFL commissioner under the bus.  That was hysterical.  Tackley Boo looked fine though.  Yeah, but he...  And Mel's like throwing him under the bus.  They knew what we did.  We...  They hired us.  We...  I don't...  That's what happens when you look black on the team.  That happens stupid.  Yeah.  Well...  It was...  I mean, you know, whatever.  We've moved on.  I mean, we do have problems here at XM Satellite Radio, but at least they treat us like human beings. 
[01:04:30]  You know, they understand the importance of us.  You know, we made so much money for Infinity Broadcasting and we were treated like just crap.  We really were.  Like second class citizens.  And all we were trying to do was just entertain and make people laugh.  Yeah.  But for some reason, you know, there's people doing radio that have no sense of humor even  though their show, quote, is a comedy show.  Yeah.  You know, we railed on Imus just as bad as Howard when we were on in New York. 
[01:05:00]  Just as bad.  Probably even worse.  Yeah.  I mean, he thought Anthony did a great impression of him.  And...  What'd you say?  Right.  I don't even understand that anymore.  I'm...  Right.  So Imus understood, you know, we're doing a radio show or we're making people laugh.  Mm-hmm.  And believe it or not, it was kind of good natured.  Especially at first, it was good natured when we went after Howard, but Howard couldn't  take it.  Right from the get-go, he couldn't take it.  Wah.  Wah.  And he knew we had some, you know, muscle behind us and we were getting a fan base and 
[01:05:30]  we were getting popular.  And he just knew he couldn't compete on that level with us.  That is a fact.  I don't care what...  Well, he ain't gonna say anything.  He's...  Trust me, he's not.  Trust me.  Because, I mean, you know, it's up to him how far, you know, he wants to go with this.  Maybe he was upset about his divorce was going on at the time.  Perhaps that was it.  Perhaps problems with his kids, you never know.  You know, perhaps he's hanging out in the hospital waiting rooms.  Who knows?  Eh. 
[01:06:00]  Eh.  How far you want to take this, Howard?  That's the question I got today.  You know, starting to think of yourself as a failed daddy.  Things like that.  Because of how your kids are acting sometimes at certain other station events.  Other station events.  You know, things like that.  Might have had him upset.  And, you know, you gotta cut him some slack.  Did we tell the other story where you sat in your limo until we were kicked out of a press  conference, where you just sat there like a little baby crying and you're on the phone  and screaming, you know, and then called Mel and said, you wanted us fired. 
[01:06:30]  But the only reason Mel didn't fire us, because it would have gotten worse, because then we  would have went across the street and competed head to head with you.  Without the gag on.  Without the gag on.  Remember the press conference, Howard?  Where it started late, because Ant and I had to get kicked out of the place?  Yeah.  Kicked us out of a press conference and then he was on the air the next day talking about  how Stuttering John got thrown out of Billy Crystal's press conference and what a pussy  Billy Crystal was for doing that.  For not handling it.  For not dealing with it.  And meanwhile, the same day, it was, it was, it was the same day, he had us thrown out 
[01:07:00]  of a press conference.  And we couldn't really.  What a hypocrite.  And we couldn't really talk about it on the air at the time because, you know, the gag  order was in place, they had a long delay, you know, there was nothing we could do.  But we're sitting there like, Howard's saying that this morning?  Yeah.  What?  Billy Crystal had you thrown out of his press conference.  What a pussy.  Billy Crystal, you're a pussy.  What, you couldn't have John just sit there at your press conference, you pussy?  He was saying that all day.  Then what happens?  We go to the press conference, throw them out.  What? 
[01:07:30]  That right there clinched it as he's one of the biggest hypocrites ever.  I was stunned.  I'm like, wait a minute.  This guy was just talking about what a pussy Billy Crystal was for having John thrown out  of his press conference.  And he did the same exact thing.  It was the son of a, son of a beach.  Son of the beach, that big successful TV show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, you know, we're working for the same company.  We get, we get press passes to go.  We're like, cool, this will be all right.  You know, it's a, it's something that our, you know, our company's involved with.  This is early on. 
[01:08:00]  We weren't really, you know, at, at, at odds like we are now with the douche bag.  No.  And so we're like, yeah, it'll be cool.  You know, plus we get free lunch, little finger sandwiches and things like that.  So Anthony and I, Anthony and I show up and Psycho Mark and Ben and who else?  Rick.  Rick.  Rick was there.  Pretty much our whole, like, you know, our whole staff on air and behind the scenes.  Mm-hmm.  And Anthony and I even take a seat in the back row.  In the back row.  Because we're not there to do anything. 
[01:08:30]  Because we knew there was some, some tension between us and, you know, the guy that's looking  more like an old lady every day.  And so we're like, all right, let's sit in the back row.  You know, we're not here to cause any problems.  We're here to check it out, you know.  Right.  And, and have free lunch.  That's literally what it was.  So we're sitting in the back row, Anthony and I.  And all of a sudden I look at Anthony, we're eating our food.  It was nice.  And a little plate of food, a little pickle and coleslaw.  And we're like, oh, this is nice, you know.  And, oh, look, he's going to come out there. 
[01:09:00]  And, oh, look at all the press.  There's, there's Penny Crone I remember seeing.  And, and others, you know, they're all there.  And, and Anthony and I are like, man, this was supposed to start at 12 or whatever the  time was at the time.  And it's now 1210.  I'm like, that's weird.  And then all of a sudden we see like, like guys in suits uncomfortably talking to each  other, like nervously.  Yeah.  And then kind of looking our way.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  Uh-oh, trouble.  So then one of the guys, and the weird thing is I didn't think anyone knew what we looked 
[01:09:30]  like because, you know, this was way before we started getting a lot of TV coverage and  getting our, our mugs in the paper and, and in a lot of these magazines since, you know.  So I'm like, God, what is going on?  And one of the guys comes up, he goes, uh, Opie and Anthony, right?  I'm like, yeah.  And he's like, guys, and this is the God's honest truth.  He goes, guys, I'm a huge fan.  I listen to you guys every afternoon.  You guys aren't going to do anything.  Are you?  I'm like, no, we're just here to eat some food and check out the press conference.  That's it.  He goes, all right.  Cause there's a lot of people really worried here. 
[01:10:00]  Learn about Cuba eating some food.  Exactly.  Like a lot of people worried here.  And, you know, so, uh, we just got to make sure I'm like, dude, trust me.  You have my word.  We're just here to eat some food, watch the thing.  And then we're going back and, uh, we'll, we'll do our show today.  He's like, all right, cool.  So then, uh, no, they're like, I'm not kidding.  15, 20 minutes go by.  Yeah.  And, and the press conference still not starting.  It's like now 1230, let's say.  Okay.  And all of a sudden like, oh man.  And now you can just feel the tension in the room building. 
[01:10:30]  And now at this point, there's other people sort of turning around.  Cause the word is getting around the room that we're there, I guess.  And we're there.  And that we're going to just raise.  Holy hell.  Yeah.  Who knows what they were thinking?  I don't know.  We were going to try to do some kind of stuttering John thing.  Right.  No, we're there to just check out a press conference.  Right.  So we're in the, you know, in the back road, uh, in the back row.  And all of a sudden the guy comes back, but now with two or three other guys, I don't  remember.  Yeah.  Security guys.  Basically security comes by with the guy.  That's a huge fan. 
[01:11:00]  You can see it on his face.  I am really sorry guys, but you got to leave.  You have to leave.  Yeah.  And I'm like, why do we have to leave?  We got press credentials and everything.  He goes, Howard wants you out of here.  Yep.  Howard wants you out of here.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  And he had called our GM, remember?  Well, that's, well then at this point, Jeremy is sprinting from 57th and 7th all the way  down to, it was at the Park Plaza, I guess, right?  Old twinkle toes.  He's running down the road.  He's running.  He's running to try to get us out of there. 
[01:11:30]  We find out later that Howard, we walked right by him because he's in this huge stretch limo  right outside the Park Plaza.  He's on the phone while all this is going down with our boss, Ken Stevens, yelling and  screaming at him, asking for our heads.  He wants us fired.  He wants us fired.  And then he threatens Ken, who he's worked with for years, going, you know, if you don't  get them fired, I will have Mel fire you.  Yeah.  That was a quote.  Yep.  Okay. 
[01:12:00]  So all of a sudden they're dragging, they're literally dragging us out of there, Ant.  They're dragging us out of there.  Not bodily, but they're making sure that we're going to leave.  And as we're walking out of the Park Plaza, all these people in suits like PR people and  market, whoever the hell they are, they all had their arms folded and they're staring  at us with this look of disgust on their faces like, how dare you?  How dare you?  Remember that?  Of course.  And then we walk out of the Park Plaza and there's the big stretch limo.  There's the big stretch limo. 
[01:12:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  There's the big stretch limo, right?  and walked toward the station, and Ben and the rest of the gang were still there.  They were the ones that would have caused the problem,  and they were sitting, I think, in the front row, or the second row.  We were in the second row.  In the second row.  And they had no idea those guys were still there, 
[01:13:00]  and literally, as we turned the corner from the Park Plaza,  he steps out of his limo and starts his press conference.  That's your big, brave hero.  Yeah, good job.  What a hypocrite.  It's just a complete hypocrite.  And growing up, like I said, on Long Island, you grow up a fan of the guy,  and then you just realize, oh, he's a douchebag.  So anyway, getting back to us.  Oh, us. 
[01:13:30]  Getting back to us.  Yeah, so we talked about Elo, right?  How ridiculous the name Elo is, you mean?  Elo tells Billboard Radio Monitor that XM is evaluating that.  Mark it on a case-by-case basis.  And Bob Eatman, the personalities agent, says he and XM are very interested in expanding the base  and brand of Opie and Anthony.  The decision to run the stars of XM's premium high-voltage channel in place of Howard Stern,  while he is on vacation, came from Citadel's headquarters in New York and was offered to 95X.  That came on the heels of a previous Citadel move that agitated Stern. 
[01:14:00]  The decision to begin cutting off a show at 10 a.m. on its four Stern affiliates, which began November 29th.  There's also a third surprise coming from Citadel Howard.  You're going to love the third surprise, by the way.  Now Citadel has upped the ante in its dispute with Stern over his move to satellite radio.  While Howard's on vacation, we're providing our listeners with some fresh entertainment.  Citadel, Syracuse, OM, Tom Mitchell tells Minor.  We have every intention of honoring our contract with Stern.  So most likely this will probably be just a temporary thing, 
[01:14:30]  but it's the start of something bigger for you and I and the radio show and our listeners and all that.  The satellite radio contract that talent agent Bob Eatman forged for O&A  differs from the one that Stern inked with Sirius,  which makes Sirius the exclusive radio outlet for Stern beginning in January 2006.  We definitely have that option to air on commercial radio with this contract that we signed.  Greg Hughes, OP told Billboard Radio Monitors, Bram, in an interview in September.  I'd personally like Satellite Radio to be so successful for us that we never go back to commercial radio, 
[01:15:00]  but we'll definitely keep that option open.  Maybe there's a form of our show that we can make available to commercial radio.  You were predicting the future.  That's right.  Like Kreskin.  You know I'm the man behind the curtain.  You know that.  Kreskin, OP.  Apparently there is.  95X has taken the pair's XM feed, editing it to conform to over-the-air standards,  and running it the following morning.  Having a full day to sanitize O&A could make the previously banished personalities  a more attractive proposition for terrestrial stations now. 
[01:15:30]  With Stern announcing his exit,  we thought it would be a perfect time to announce OP and Anthony's entrance back to commercial radio,  Eatman told Billboard Monitor.  And then he adds,  We've heard from a lot of other stations.  Right.  And then it ends with,  We'll take it one step at a time and move slowly.  Case by case says,  XM's ELO.  Could the availability of the show on free over-the-air radio cannibalize XM efforts to lure O&A fans as subscribers?  No, says ELO.  XM is the only outlet for their uncensored show, he notes, 
[01:16:00]  and it is available to XM subscribers on demand,  since Channel 202 repeats their morning show continuously, 24-7.  There you go.  There it is.  There you go.  And before we take our first break,  let's go to Chris in Syracuse.  Chris, what's up?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hi, Poopy.  Hi, sweetie pie.  How are you?  They're playing yesterday's show on Syracuse.  All right.  Turn it up. 
[01:16:30]  I want to hear what they're playing right this moment.  They're playing a song right now.  Really?  Oh, some rock music?  Okay.  Yeah, because I think yesterday's show was pretty dirty.  I can't imagine how they're going to clean up yesterday's show for regular radio.  Was it?  Oh, my God.  Was it filth ridden?  Dude, it was really filthy.  They were going to start playing What's in My Pants,  and then they cut it off.  Oh, do they really?  Yeah, well, that would be smart.  See?  That's what I'm trying to tell people that have the XM satellite radio.  There's a lot of things they're not going to be able to play on regular radio,  so don't you worry. 
[01:17:00]  Thank you, Chris.  Yep.  Yeah, I got another example of that, actually, Anthony, as we go to break.  Oh, what do we have?  This is something they definitely can't play on commercial radio.  She spilled.  No, that's not that.  She spilled my coffee.  Oh, how did you tease that and not play it?  All right, we'll play it at a break.  I hope so, Opie.  We will, Jimmy.  We will.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  I'm sorry, sir.  Dumb Canadian accent.  This is the South Park song.  Get out.  This is the South Park song we played yesterday.  Yes.  And the email went nuts because this is a version of the song that has not been available. 
[01:17:30]  No.  Because it's really dirty.  It's not on the show.  And I guess Kenny sings over the really bad part so you don't understand what's going on.  Right.  But we have a clean version of the song.  Is Steve around?  I don't even know where he got this.  Because everyone's asking where could they get this version of the song.  Steve doesn't remember either, Eric's telling us.  All right.  Whatever.  Well, just enjoy it.  It's from South Park.  It's a Christmas song.  It's really offensive.  And it's pretty rare. 
[01:18:00]  It's hard to find.  In this version.  In this version, anyway.  Virgin Mary was sleeping when Angel Gabriel appeared.  He said, you are to be the virgin mother.  But Mary thought that was weird.  Mary said, I'm not a virgin.  I blew a guy last year.  But then Gabriel said to Mary, my child, have no fear. 
[01:18:30]  Well, you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin.  Mary!  You can suck all the dick you want and still not be considered flawed.  Although you went to town and sucked some semen down.  You're still a virgin in the eyes of God.  There was no room at the inn when Mary and Joseph did arrive. 
[01:19:00]  But they were so very tired to see that Mary had to offer a bribe.  Since she had no money, how would she pay for a place to sleep?  Gabriel appeared to Mary and told her not to wait.  Because you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin.  Mary!  You can suck all the dick you want and still be the mother of Christ.  If there's no room at the inn, then it's not considered a sin 
[01:19:30]  To suck some dick to get a room for the night.  Then three wise men did appear, bearing gifts of myrrh and such.  They said that they had followed a star and missed a woman's touch.  Mary thought she might pleasure them, but could not take them to bed.  But again, Gabriel appeared to her and this is what he said. 
[01:20:00]  You can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin.  Mary!  You can suck all the dick you want and everyone that hangs in the nation.  But Alatio ain't no sin.  Gonna blow those three wise men.  And you'll still be a virgin cause there was no penetration.  So you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin.  Mary! 
[01:20:30]  The donkey and the ox and the lambs and even the little drummer boy.  People will remember your name quick.  They'll say, damn, that bitch could suck a good dick.  Cause sucking dick brings peace on earth and joy.  Cause sucking dick brings peace on earth and joy.  Mary, Mary, suck that dick.  We hate all shit things.

[01:27:30]  This Wednesday, between 6 and 7 a.m., during your morning commute, get to Grand Central Station in New York City and pick up your Wow Stickers.  Whoa, those aren't real.  Yes, they are.  The entrance on 42nd Street, near the subway and taxi stand.  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here is how it should sound.  The Wow Sticker Stop.  Brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Ah, Merry Christmas, everyone. 
[01:28:00]  Merry Christmas.  This is Gary Hoey, I believe, right?  Doing all the rejoiners for us this week.  Yeah.  Old Pals.  Gary Hoey, you're right. 
[01:28:30]  Ho, ho, hoey.  Remember that album?  That was his album, right?  Ho, ho, hoey.  Ho, ho.  I want to say hi to all the people in the Foundry chat room.  We're getting...  We're getting emails.  They're all excited now because we just mentioned the Foundry chat room.  Woo!  They acknowledged us.  Relax, douchebags.  Guys, guys, hanging in the Foundry chat room.  We all say enough with the FM crap. 
[01:29:00]  Move on.  It...  Oh, you're programming the show now?  Foundry chat?  Go screw.  What, you had enough?  You're not happy with the past hour and a half of programming?  We just did an hour and 20 minutes straight without commercials.  Well, you didn't like the...  We covered four or five different things.  A couple of topics.  But I guess the Foundry chat room isn't happy with the program. 
[01:29:30]  So we have to change it.  Clear the phone lines.  Let's move on.  Turn the phone lines and move on because Foundry chat is telling us.  The Foundry chat said that.  Why don't you shut up?  Jesus Christ.  Go back to just enjoying the show, please.  Enjoy the show like a radio show.  Some of the stuff you like.  Some of the stuff you don't.  Some of the stuff you'll think we're going on too long with.  Some of the stuff you think we stopped too quickly.  Enjoy it like a show.  Not a friggin' religion, you dickbag.  Dick from Maine. 
[01:30:00]  Because for every person that says, well, I'm not digging the FM chat stuff, which is,  by the way, huge news for the Opie and Anthony show, so bear with us.  There's people that are like, oh, wow, this is really cool.  Or, oh, my God, I'm glad you're telling that Howard story because I never heard it before  and I've heard rumors about the problems you guys had when you guys were working for the  same company.  So we can't satisfy everyone all of the time.  Yeah, and perhaps you sat there and read every interview we did and heard some of that stuff 
[01:30:30]  that we talked about.  It's not all about you, douchebag.  Oh, yeah, the Foundry chat is programming the Opie and Anthony show now.  We should just take what they say on Foundry chat.  We'll be so much more successful, Opie.  Sit down and relax.  Let me prove my point.  So then this guy from Jersey, guys.  Go to a porn site instead.  Oh, they are on Foundry.  Okay.  There's a guy from Jersey.  He goes, you guys should read this chat room crap.  Some of these people are just bitter zilches with nothing better to do. 
[01:31:00]  As I sit in the room and fester myself, I have nothing.  And then there's a guy from San Francisco.  Okay.  This is the problem with doing a radio show.  You can't please everybody.  So the Foundry chat people just have had enough with the Howard and the FM and all that, right?  Oh, okay.  Well, Tad from San Francisco.  Okay.  Is this the airing of the grievances show?  I hope so because the hardcore listeners love this S because there was so much we weren't allowed to know in the old days. 
[01:31:30]  So there you go.  Artie Mack from Yonkers.  F them.  What type of loser wakes up early just to go to an effing chat room?  Go to work.  Don't you people have homes?  You guys really got to relax.  Anthony and I have been doing this for 10 years.  We really know what we're doing.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  If you sit there critiquing every second that comes out of the show, Jesus. 
[01:32:00]  Unbelievable.  The Foundry chat has had enough, Opie.  The Foundry chat.  Aren't there 18,000 links to teen porn sites on Foundry?  What are you doing in the chat room?  Aren't there wee-wee videos on there that you could click on at the drop of a hat?  Know what they have up there today?  I think Steve linked it.  They have a video clip of me breaking my hand by a breast.  What's her name? 
[01:32:30]  Busty.  Busty Hart, I think.  Busty Hart.  That is a funny-ass clip, man.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  Well, it's up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com, I believe.  Basically, this chick had...  She had huge implants.  Massive.  Yeah, but she had the old-school kind where it's like concrete.  You know what it was like?  I'll tell you what those implants are like.  It's like they took a giant Stretch Armstrong and put him in there.  You know that hard...  Like, Stretch Armstrong seems soft, but when you used to crack your brother in the head with it, 
[01:33:00]  it worked like a blackjack.  That's what her implants felt like.  They were like...  She would squeeze them and her fingers would go in like they were soft.  But then she would crush cans with her boobs.  She would put a can...  The breasts were like the stress balls that are filled with the balloons with the sand.  Did you say that?  Stretch Armstrong, yeah.  Okay, I'm sorry, because I was reading more critiques.  She would have someone hold a can and then take her boob like a hammer and slam it on top of the can and crush the can. 
[01:33:30]  And so Opie was the volunteer to hold the bottom of this can.  And he's holding it.  She winds up...  She grabs her boob like at the base and swings it like a sock full of sand.  Only these things are huge.  And she swung it, hit the can, and kind of missed the side of the can and slammed Opie's hand between the wood console and her boob.  And you just let out this horrible scream.  It hurt.  Like your hand was swollen. 
[01:34:00]  No, it didn't...  Sorry.  How's that Pop-Tart?  Well, we didn't break and now, you know, we gotta eat.  Could you please not discuss the Pop-Tarts?  Thank you, Foundry Chat.  Now look what I do all day.  Good.  Tap away, Opie.  That's right.  Tap away.  Because they hate the tapping.  They hate when you eat.  They hate my grammar.  They have to hate Ben trickling around.  They hate that I read copy awfully. 
[01:34:30]  I add commas and periods.  They hate the fact that Ben turns the pages like this.  That's just a low-pressure system that's swirling around his hair constantly.  You have to really turn that page to get it over the bulge.  I did read that people are annoyed with this.  When we're talking about anything, you know,  it's a horrible situation over there in Iraq.  Ben just cackling at anything in the background. 
[01:35:00]  He doesn't even know what he's cackling at.  So, what were we talking about?  Thoughts in his head make him laugh.  We're talking about the video?  Yeah.  What video?  So it's up on Foundry Music and Opie and Anthony.  The best part...  Click on that.  The best part, some British, I don't know, TV show?  Oh, yeah.  That's where it's from.  Found the clip.  Aired it somewhere.  We don't even know where, but we can tell it's from way over there.  And as I'm screaming, because I think I broke my hand.  No joke.  It turned out to be Sprain. 
[01:35:30]  I mean, you know, I'm screaming, and now the audience is laughing.  They think it's the funniest thing they made.  It was almost like an English version of America's Funniest Home Videos.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  They have the English guy, sets up the clip, and then they play it.  Opie gets his hand smashed.  He goes, ah!  And you hear the audience, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's like clapping.  Can I say, by the way, I hate breast tricks.  Oh, no.  Any time a stripper, like the old lady with the big heavy, ah!  I went to a strip club out on Long Island years ago. 
[01:36:00]  I used to go there when we were done with the job.  At lunch, we would go and hang out at the strip clubs, local Long Island strip clubs.  And they're just awful, most of them.  Uh-oh.  Coffee diva, what's the matter, Jimmy?  Jim Norton, coffee diva.  That isn't your coffee?  Maybe, I just wanted a medium coffee with a little bit of skim milk and a sugar.  Maybe this is it.  I could be wrong.  Uh-oh.  But if not, I hope he has some type of a salve to remove third-degree coffee burns from his face and neck. 
[01:36:30]  I think Noah's out of it today a little bit.  No, Noah.  Oh, this is Mike.  What is this, bro?  Get on, Mike, Mike.  Medium coffee, skim milk, one sugar.  Oh, it is medium coffee.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Just ask, because there's a foam in it.  I thought it was like a latte or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of them damn fancy drinks.  Yeah.  What am I supposed to do?  Just sit there in a robe and eat cheese and crackers and watch Survivor drinking this?  What are you talking about?  No, I'm just saying that.  Oh.  I have no idea what you're talking about. 
[01:37:00]  Anyway.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  We used to go to these Long Island strip clubs, and they were all into those little tricks.  They thought it would bring them more money.  And one girl would take matches.  Oh, the match trip.  Yeah.  And split the match, stick them on the tips of her boobies, and light them up and do a little dance.  Like, she's got boobies flambe, and then blow them out.  And people would be, you know...  That's Bob Seger's playing? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  We've got tonight.  As she's doing a rug act.  Who needs tomorrow?  Let's make it last.  Let's find a way.  And she's rolling on the floor, flittering her legs.  Yeah, the phony eye look they give you.  It was the old Long Island Club rug act that you just don't see anymore.  Because they've tried to adopt the New York City strip club feel on Long Island.  It just doesn't cut it.  It's not made for it.  When you go near the train station in Ronkonkoma, and you're going to Bird's Place, 
[01:38:00]  you just want to see a biker strip club where you go in, see the girl try to sneak around the rules by showing a little.  Yes.  She pulls her bottom aside a little bit.  You know, that was cool.  Stuff like that.  Their nymphs are all burnt from the match trick.  From the match trick going awry.  They've got C-section scars.  That's what you want to see.  When you're pulling your hand out from putting a dollar in the G-string,  you want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck, like a quagmire.  Exactly. 
[01:38:30]  Here's a dollar.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  And you remember, with every dollar, you remember why your mommy told you,  don't put money in your mouth and you don't know where it's been because that's where it might have been.  They've tried to become more high-end and upper-class like New York clubs, and it just doesn't work.  I used to go there to hang out with your buds, drink some overpriced beer,  and see the strippers get around the rules that are in place.  They would show you, man. 
[01:39:00]  They would pull that bottom aside and show you a little something, and that's what made the money.  They'd step around the bar, the same dancers up there for a half hour or something like that,  just milking every buck she could, and it was a buck.  It was easy, you know?  Like a toucher, right?  You could touch a little bit?  Yeah.  There was some touching going on.  As long as it was cool with the biker bouncer at the door, you know, they're all in there.  They understand the rules.  Now, you know, they try to make these places into, they have a private lap dance area for 20 bucks.  It's like it used to be the men's room.  Shut up. 
[01:39:30]  This is not the champagne room.  A gentleman's club.  It's for gentlemen.  Yeah, gentleman's club.  Now, give me the old black-painted window strip club.  Yep.  I want to go in there, catch a couple of beers during work.  You want to feel a little naughty as you're going into the place.  Right.  You want to walk out and look like Frankenstein hitting the sunlight.  Like, ah, you know, you walk out and there's like a highway in front of you.  Yeah, yeah.  And you walk out and try to turn your head.  Right, right, right.  You don't want people seeing you coming out of there at like one in the afternoon.  You park in the supermarket parking lot. 
[01:40:00]  Right, right, or park way in the back.  I quickly jump the curb.  It's like the last scene in, was it Brubaker when they come out of the hole?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Brubaker.  Right.  Are you coming out of the hole for the first time?  That's how you feel when leaving these strip clubs.  But you want to go in a back door and you want the windows all painted on work.  You do.  You want it all like dark in there.  You don't want this glittery atmosphere that they try to do.  I liked the local strip clubs.  I don't want everything to try to be scores, you know? 
[01:40:30]  A bit of a mess, the strippers.  Not bad.  Right.  But not perfect.  A little sloppy.  Yes.  Yeah.  They're regular girls.  We call it a little skank.  A little skank.  One little skank.  I used to have, I used to work at Apollo air conditioning, as you know.  And we used to park our trucks way in the back because it's on a highway.  So if any of the bosses had driven by and seen it.  Ah, the bosses would understand.  I met some of your bosses.  Yeah, I know.  They're at the other strip clubs.  True.  But I'd get, like, I'd get back in the truck and hear, you know, base to 21, base to 21. 
[01:41:00]  Are you on the job site?  And then you're like, oh man, what if someone saw the truck?  You're freaking out.  What if someone saw the truck?  Should I say yes?  Right.  And then they'll say that they saw my truck behind the strip club?  Or should I just fess up and say I'm at the strip club?  There's no right answer.  Or, or I'm like, yeah.  I'm not at the job site.  I'm, I'm at Granger.  I had to pick up some materials for the job.  All right.  Well, check in when you get back to the job site.  And you'd hear this sarcastic. 
[01:41:30]  And then we know you're looking at boobies.  And by the way, why are you listening to that faggy Bob Seger song?  Anthony believes that any answer he gives will be wrong.  And the dispatcher will beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.  There it is.  And the rug act.  They would play a song like this.  Uh, the girl would come out with a, it looked like a quilt that she's had since high school.  That, uh, grandma made for her.  Yeah, it would be rolled up by the side of the stage.  And then she would grab it.  Open it up on the stage. 
[01:42:00]  Lay down on her back.  With, uh, really good view facing you.  And flitter her legs and move her, arch her back and stuff to the music.  And it was a rug act.  And you just don't see that anymore in strip clubs.  And it was one of the best things they could do.  And you're just heaving dollars at her.  And, and again, the side of the, uh, G-string might get pulled aside during this thing.  And you'd get a great little show.  Yep.  Nice.  Very nice.  The song brings back memories.  I've only been in one place where that you can actually do more. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  And that was recently when I was shooting something up in, like, probably four months ago.  Shooting something.  It's called goo.  Dude, I never walked out of a strip club broke.  I, uh, I, obviously I dumped off two.  On the third one, I just couldn't.  And my mule just, just looked at me and said, what are you, high, stupid?  Uh, but I'd never had that.  It was so hot.  It was a little skanky strip club in upstate New York.  The girls would do anything for money.  It was so.  You want a little skanky girl.  300 bucks.  I got three of them off.  Nice.  Three times I finished.  Wow.  That's a lot of money in a strip club, my friend. 
[01:43:00]  But not if you go into Scores or something, or someplace like that.  I know, right, right.  Where you're up a thousand bucks and you get nothing.  You're dumping thousands.  And you get nothing.  And it's 20 at a clip to get nothing.  Those lame lap dances.  Because the girls are 11s.  They're used to guys who make like 400, 800 thousand dollars a year.  So it's like you have nothing to offer them.  I want the day stripper at the strip club near the train station.  That works, you know, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  Early afternoon.  Early afternoon shift.  You want the minor league.  Right.  The minor leagues, they always try a little harder, don't they? 
[01:43:30]  They're not jaded like the pros.  You don't want the pros.  You want triple A.  Right.  They're trying to get up another notch, aren't they?  Sure.  They're working a little harder.  They're willing to look and bend the rules a little bit.  Yep.  I like that.  I like a little skank.  Yeah, I love that.  Right on, man.  That is good.  That is good.  And you never knew.  That was the best thing.  You never knew what you were going to get.  But as far as the quality of a girl, what she was willing to do on stage, some of them  are so coked out and drunk that they don't even know what the hell they're doing up there. 
[01:44:00]  They go out with their panties off.  Oh, I forgot.  Well, they take their panties off.  I've seen this, too, to try to get around the rules.  They put on like almost a little hula skirt, just grass.  And as they're dancing around, the thing's flipping up, and you're seeing all kinds  of stuff.  But I guess technically, they're within the rules.  I still prefer a juice bar.  I don't drink, but juice bars, you can have the total nudity, which I like.  And bring your own booze or whatever. 
[01:44:30]  I like the total nudity.  Not good for midday during working hours, though, because you want to catch a little buzz with  your friends, get back to the job, and work heavy machinery a little drunk.  Rob from Long Island, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good, buddy.  How you doing, Buttercup?  Hi, sweetie.  Thanks for calling the radio program.  Oh, no problem.  Yeah, me and my friend used to go to this club called Cinderella's.  It was a good club, but it eventually got shut down because a mob ran it.  But the first room, when you walk into the club, it was a porn shop. 
[01:45:00]  And then the next room was where all the peep show boots were.  And then the next room was where the dancers were.  But these girls, they totally got around the rules because if they were dancing totally  naked, they'd be, like, figuring themselves on the stage.  But, like, the quality of girls were, like, Anthony's right, which is horrible.  They'd all have, like, tattoos all over them, saggy stomachs.  We'll go out, like, a big, like, freaking, look like a cesarean skull, like, right there.  Oh, yeah.  No pride.  They just don't care.  A good neck wound.  Norton, I got a question for you. 
[01:45:30]  Not going to work, sir.  I'm too good.  No, I got a question.  Okay.  Does it sound like a phone hanging up?  No, see.  No, see, he was totally on to it.  You could hear it in the tone of their voice that they're trying.  Hey, I was wondering.  I'm done with my conversation.  Hey, Jimmy.  Oh.  Snap those little arms and then just beat her to death.  Someone actually got a picture, a screen cap from that film on dwarfs.  It's called Dwarfs, Not a Fairy Tale. 
[01:46:00]  That's the name of the actual special that was on HBO that has that little fidget getting  proposed to and freaking out with her little arms, bringing them, trying to bring them up  to her face and going, oh, all excited that she was just proposed to.  Someone got a screen cap of that, and it's up on the message board, I guess.  But funny as hell to look at.  We have to get that sound clip of her.  I know.  Too bad I can't get one of the stupid Bob Kelly sprouting the waterworks.  Crying.  Doesn't this make you sad?  You're going to squirt? 
[01:46:30]  Shut up.  You're going to squirt?  Great Santeen.  Someone's in front of Bob throwing a cock and balls against his face.  What's wrong with that?  What's that?  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, ho.  What's going on, Art?  Popcorn D-Bat.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I don't know.  You're eating popcorn.  I'm eating pop-tarts, which are very bad, but I'm trying to watch my carbs, so thank  you, but no.  That came out of a gift basket we received yesterday, I believe.  Thank you, but no.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to thank Elo for the gift basket. 
[01:47:00]  Isn't that funny?  Elo sends us a gift basket with cheese and dried sausage in it, and he didn't know.  Oh, really?  But he didn't do it on purpose because we were goofing on Frenchy.  I guess it was en route when we were goofing on how bad cheese and sausage is.  That was to congratulate us on our sub-numbers that are just way higher than they expected.  Why do you call him Elo?  I like to call him Eric from the block.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's up, Ben?  I just heard that Frenchy was very upset by his appearance yesterday.  Of course.  He was all sad.  He was depressed.  Why?  I don't know.  He should have been sad and depressed at that party. 
[01:47:30]  I know.  Jesus.  He does take everything to heart here.  Oh, God.  He called.  You can't help it if he throws an awful party.  Mary Tyler Moore party.  Let's go to Buffalo.  BC, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I just want to say, you probably remember from your days up there, but the Canadian side  of the bridge, we call it the Canadian Ballet.  Of course.  The Canadian Ballet was legendary.  They do the floor act.  It's naked.  Totally nude.  You can get your nids taken care of, and it's in Canadian money. 
[01:48:00]  I had a bad experience.  I had a bad experience in Toronto.  What?  With that.  With a strip club.  No, we're talking just over the border, man.  Right over the peace bridge.  It's all Canadian strip clubs where the girls would do anything.  Wow.  Because they're basically second class citizens because it's Canada, man.  Because they're Canadian.  They're Canadian.  So they try a little harder.  They're hoping that you're going to bring them back into the States.  I know you're coming just for that.  Huh?  They know you're coming for that on the border.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was unbelievable, the Canadian Ballet.  It was all, like, 19, 20-year-old girls getting completely nude. 
[01:48:30]  Nah.  Nah.  Why?  I had a bad experience.  You're talking Toronto.  That's, like, back into, like, you know, we're talking right over the border.  Like, Buffalo's an awful place to live.  Trust me.  I just did not enjoy my time, and now that I'm away from that hellhole, I can tell everyone  that.  Stop thinking I'm, like, some conquering hero.  Child of Buffalo.  When I come back to Buffalo.  I hated my time there.  I did three years of Overnight Radio.  Buffalo's own Greg Opie Hughes.  Yeah, they try to say that.  It's like, no, I'm from Long Island.  I had to work up there for three years. 
[01:49:00]  The Spud's Buckley.  It was like a prison sentence.  I hated it.  And the girls are all fat, and they freaking, they cover their fatness with huge, oversized  Buffalo Bills sweatshirts.  At least the winners are nice.  We call them Buffalo Bettys, man.  So, anyway, Buffalo's an awful place to live.  No offense to BC and everybody else up there.  I'm not taking any.  And I've lived, you know, in a lot of places, so I can understand which ones were cool and  which ones stink.  And the interesting thing about the strip clubs, now, these places are over in Canada, 
[01:49:30]  right over the border.  Yeah.  So, Buffalo awful.  You could just imagine these tiny little towns, you know, the first towns as you get into Canada,  how awful they are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, the point I'm making is, they're really desperate down there near the Peace Bridge  and all that.  Yeah.  What was the other bridge, bro?  There's Lewiston Bridge.  There's the Rainbow Bridge.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I'm thinking Peace Bridge, though.  Okay.  So, you had all these little towns, and they all were strip clubs, Anthony.  Now, you're talking Toronto.  Now, you're talking about a really nice Canadian city. 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  So, I think the attitudes are going to be different is what I'm trying to say.  And you can get in those Canadian strip clubs at 19, too, and drink.  Yeah.  So, that's like an added bonus.  Gotta love it.  No, the one I went to, the problem was, we're walking down the street, we pass a strip club,  I see the little advertisements in their window, and it shows pictures of these just hot chicks,  totally nude.  So, me and I was with my band at the time, we're like, hey, let's check this place out. 
[01:50:30]  We go inside, and it was, I thought we were in Saigon.  I absolutely, there wasn't one American or Canadian girl in this club.  I don't want to see Saigon.  I don't want to see Asian girls dancing.  I wanted to see Americans or Canadian chicks.  It's because you went to Toronto.  The Asians are taking over Toronto.  Have they really?  Oh, my God.  That's their city now.  It's all Asians in Toronto.  It was awful.  And there we were, stuck, giving those stupid, throwing loonies at their heads. 
[01:51:00]  That's stupid money.  That's stupid Canadian money.  It's worthless.  It really is.  But they look you in the eye and give you that look.  That look when they're dancing.  That look, Jeremy.  What?  That look.  The Vietnamese up there?  Yeah.  Yeah, like they spit a razor blade out into their hand and slit your throat.  What look do the Asians give you?  The same look that they give when they're ordering something online?  Or the same look that they give when they're asking you if you have change of a dollar?  Or the same look? 
[01:51:30]  It's the same look.  Exactly.  I saw nothing.  Exactly.  It's the type of look you see after you're stopped on a dark highway and you see a light  in the sky and you're abducted.  That's the same expression.  Yeah, same expression.  Those awful aliens have.  I was hoping to get the leggy girls that they were showing in the posters in front of the  club.  And what do you get?  You get short legs, a flat ass.  I'm sorry.  And no expression.  It's very rare you find an Asian girl with a nice pooper. 
[01:52:00]  You know?  I got a theory.  Usually kind of flat.  I got a theory.  I think the Asians are actually the aliens.  You think that's what happened?  Yeah, there's aliens walking the earth and I think they're inbred with the Asians.  I really believe that.  Yeah, they come from a whole nother.  They are smart.  They come from a whole different world.  Got a great work ethic.  You kind of need that for space travel, I would think.  You might hate the blacks, but you can understand the blacks. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, jeez.  You can understand them.  Who's even going there?  You can understand them, though.  But when you look at Asians, they just have a whole different mindset.  That's true.  It's pretty hard for us to understand the culture.  I'm telling you.  The ways of life.  They have breeded with the aliens that have been walking the earth for many, many, many centuries.  I haven't even seen that on a conspiracy website.  No, it's very odd.  It's your own theory?  Yeah, Asians and cats.  Cats are aliens, too?  Oh, yeah.  Study a cat for an hour. 
[01:53:00]  There's something going on there.  They're communicating with somebody.  You're a mad person.  You are insane.  I'm telling you.  Asians and cats.  And they eat cats.  I'll be proven right someday.  That's interesting.  Cats are not from this world, either.  Asians and cats are not from this world.  And I do like my brothers out there.  Hold it.  Hold it.  I just want to see how Foundry Chat is reacting to this.  Gosh, enough with the Asians. 
[01:53:30]  I hope they like it.  Jack holes.  And another thing, when I make fun of Jimmy about it's only $50,000, it's called sarcasm!  What, someone emailed you about that?  Anyone else?  Anyone else don't like when Opie just makes believe $50,000 is no big deal?  Yeah, there are a few people that just do not understand the concept of sarcasm. 
[01:54:00]  It's called busting Jimmy's ass.  I mean, he lost an S-load of money because at the old place, the program director got really lazy,  or I don't know what he was doing, but he didn't get Jimmy's paperwork in in time.  So Jimmy lost about $50,000.  That's called sarcasm.  I'm busting his nut.  And Opie blows it off like it's nothing.  And the guy, somebody actually thought...  They start a whole conversation about it.  Did anyone else feel a little pissed at Opie that he's making believe $50,000 is no big deal?  You know what?  Anyone that was saying that and commenting on that, right now, know that you are just a jerk-off. 
[01:54:30]  That you are an idiot who missed the joke.  Who cannot understand sarcasm.  You're stupid.  Your friends think you're stupid.  You're the guy in the group that doesn't ever get the joke.  You're an idiot.  If you're going to listen to this program,  look up the word sarcasm, because it happens a lot on this program.  And you're saying it's only $50,000,  and you're in a way saying I have every right to be furious at this guy. 
[01:55:00]  That's only $50,000.  No, I'm going to get started and get annoyed at it.  How can anybody not grasp that?  Unbelievable how completely moronic some of the people are that enjoy this program.  It was like...  This happened one time.  There's a comedian named Todd Lynn, who I'm actually friends with,  and we were on Tough Crowd one time,  and I would always call Colin Bosch and go,  Good point, Carl.  Thanks for saying that.  You're right.  Right.  And it was so obviously over the top.  Sure.  And Todd goes, Look at you, kissing his ass.  And I'm like, Are you really in the same business I'm in? 
[01:55:30]  Dope.  It's so obvious.  I mean, it was like...  Do you not know that I'm just being a worm for the goof?  Oh, God.  That's great.  But you think that I was really...  Yeah.  Well, whenever that comes up, I always say,  Ah, it's only $50,000, Jim.  No big deal.  Yeah, you think a guy that tries to hide his Polish maid from all of us  is going to goof on $50,000?  Exactly.  I mean, you know, it's not like you're saying,  Hey, it's only another man and some cheese.  He's acknowledging the importance of that.  You know, $50,000.  Coffee Diva. 
[01:56:00]  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Hi, Steve.  Hi, Jimmy.  We got the Croce on the line?  Pat Croce?  Oh.  We have to take a quick break.  Will he mind?  I got to take a leak.  Will he mind?  I'll ask him first.  I don't want him pissed off.  Why are we playing the...  Oh, okay.  We can play...  That's a good find, I guess.  People want to know if you're building the Devil's Tower in your oatmeal.  No?  Okay.  No.  The answer is no.  I've blown off the oatmeal today anyway, so... 
[01:56:30]  I'm telling you.  Asians and cats.  This means something.  Asians and cats.  Think about it.  Wait, guys.  He really doesn't mean that?  Like, he is just joking.  Just don't think that he means that Asians and cats really aren't wonderful like peoples  and animals.  He really means it.  That he really means.  And when I was talking about the brothers out there, that was a joke too, okay?  Because someone will write up that we're racist.  Shut up.  I have black friends.  And Steve, by the way, is not really on fire.  He just wears clothes with flames.  So we kind of say that, but we really don't mean it. 
[01:57:00]  Exactly.  You know, that's kind of dangerous for Steve to be walking around in flames every day.  You know, I just don't get why they let him in the studio when he could set the whole  place on fire.  Rest of the foundry chat guys, what do you think?  Jack off.  And how could there be a weather storm front just in Ben's hair?  That doesn't make sense.  That is physically impossible.  I think the guys are a bunch of liars.  Yeah.  But when it does come to Ben, we're not really exaggerating.  It's not exaggerated humor.  He really does herky and jerk a lot.  You know, I could accept the fact that he might be herkying, but no one can jerky after 
[01:57:30]  a herky.  And look, how could you not tell the difference between his bulge and a Haitian family?  There's no way they could be really confusing those two things.  I think they're lying to us.  And he doesn't exaggerate when he's being the gossip guy.  Oh, no, that's absolutely true.  That is the biggest...  How could they fit that many electronics into something the size of a bottle cap that is  Ben's phone?  Yeah, he couldn't really be talking on a phone that small.  Because you have to go between your mouth and your ear, and you wouldn't be able to hear. 
[01:58:00]  See, I know.  I'm smart.  No, you're not, idiot.  Jim couldn't have really paid for that many transvestites to perform more...  Oh, yeah.  Scratch.  Wait, I did the math.  Okay.  One more call.  Porky from the trucker.  What?  Break, break.  You've got to take a break.  I know.  Porky has a good story, though.  Yeah, Opie will break when Opie's ready, right, Opie?  All right.  Porky.  Porky.  Oh, wait.  I had to do this.  Put it over there.  All right.  Now, shut up. 
[01:58:30]  And I'm working on trying to say put, okay?  So calm down.  Porky, what's up?  Yo, O and A.  Hey.  There's a place out in Western PA.  I'm a truck driver, and I used to run Toledo, Ohio to New York City just like three times  a week.  It's called the Interstate Body Shop.  They advertise on the Phoebe Radio.  It's free coffee and everything for the truckers.  And you go, and it costs you $10.  You can get a free shower.  Do they have some pigs in this place?  I went in there one night, and this wide, hip, big mama is on the floor on her ass with 
[01:59:00]  her ankles behind her ears.  And she reaches down and opens up the friggin' roast beef curtain she's got, and she wants  guys to throw dollar bills at her.  And if you get one in the hall, you get a free lap dance.  Hey, look at that.  That's a class joint.  When she opened this up, I'm telling you what, it looked like it should have had its  own brain, because I'm looking for things to fall out of it.  Right.  I stick a dollar bill in my mouth, get it like a good spitball, and I throw it, and it 
[01:59:30]  goes right in the hall.  First shot.  That's hilarious, dude.  Oh.  Good for you.  What a big joint.  Thank you, buddy.  It sounds kind of like our curry darts thing.  We were slightly distracted.  Sorry, there's a guy on TV.  He, on a, first of all, he's on a unicycle, which is basketball net high, and he's shooting  baskets.  Yeah.  I hate anything on a unicycle.  Unicycles stink.  They're never funny, and they're never entertaining.  No.  Nothing.  It's just, it's an awful device.  And they're not fun.  No.  Oh, he's got the hat. 
[02:00:00]  Look, he's lifting his hat up on the unicycle.  Oh, look at him juggle on the unicycle.  He's going forward and backward real fast in one place.  Oh, he's talking to the audience while juggling on the unicycle.  Unicycle.  What year is this?  That was entertainment in the 1800s.  Exactly.  With the other bicycle with the big front wheel and the little back one.  That's the same time.  That thing faded away.  So should the unicycle.  That's with that little back tire next to the big, you can picture that little back  tire going, oh.  Oh, more unicycle talk from the guys. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, you guys are really out of control.  You have lost your minds.  All right, Anthony, in honor of the Asian strippers that you don't like.  Yes.  It's a bit of a reach, but what the hell.  It's Brother Joe and the Sarsong.  We haven't played this in a while.  All right.  New listeners.  I actually like this one a lot.  I like it.  Sick with the Sars, I cough and I wheeze. 
[02:01:00]  That incurable illness.  Thank the Chinese for Sars.  Infected with Sars, I cough, I'm in pain.  I must have caught it from that chink on the plane with Sars. 
[02:01:30]  Sickened by Sars, and it really shows.  My right lung exploded and blew out of my nose.  It's Sars.  Chinese gave me Sars. 
[02:02:00]  I am very sick, but I'm not like them.  With their really small height and Sars.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze the bread. 
[02:02:30]  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hard piece of ass.  What a handful.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  We all be an angry show.  We're about to win again.  In case you didn't know.

Girls get all energetic. 
[02:03:30]  My girlfriend wants to cook stuff.  She's got a cake in the oven.  She's roasting a pig on a spit that she killed with her own bare hands.  You know, she's painting the house, raking leaves.  Meanwhile, I'm at the hospital.  My blood pressure is three over one.  I'm on life support systems.  The doctor's like, he came three times?  That means irreversible brain damage.  Guys have no energy after sex, do they?  I'm surprised rapists don't get caught every time. 
[02:04:00]  So, officer, how'd you apprehend the suspect?  Well, he chased him 50 feet and he passed out.  Where's the woman?  She's in the woods doing jumping jacks.  After I have sex, my legs are like a newborn calf.  You know, I'm in the kitchen in my underwear trying to make a sandwich.  Look out the window.  She's putting in a built-in pool.  Yeah, it's 80 feet deep enough, honey.  What did I shoot into you? 
[02:04:30]  Cracks?  Sit down for crying out.  We'll have sex tomorrow night and clean the garage.  You know what I mean?  After a good blowjob, I need a walker.  Only one thing got me out of college.  High school.  And high school was tough.  And grammar school, I couldn't spell at all.

[02:06:30]  All right.  Lots of show to do still.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Thanks to you.  The walls with bouts of holly.  Stalker Patty's here with her Christmas gifts for everybody.  Did she make them this year?  A lot of people don't even know who Stalker Patty is.  People that are brand new to the show.  Known her for years, man.  For like five years we've known her?  I don't know.  She was there when we first got to NEW, when we first came to New York for Massachusetts. 
[02:07:00]  And she used to be a complete mess.  Somehow she got her life in order.  And that annoys me.  Because now she's coming with Christmas gifts and I see it's in a nice bag.  They're actual things.  She used to come with, I swear, it was like something you'd hang on your refrigerator if you had a six-year-old.  It was, I brought you this for your birthday, Opie.  And it was like macaroni glued on a paper plate with silver spray paint. 
[02:07:30]  That was the stuff she used to bring.  And Opie would look at it.  What?  What happened?  There were just highly uncomfortable moments.  Oh.  Why?  Because you knew it was going to happen.  You'd grab it and before you knew it, you'd hear a smash.  There was painted macaroni everywhere.  Yeah, and she's standing there trying not to cry.  Yeah.  Well, the first time I did it, you know, it was great because no one expected it.  And then she cried and we laughed and we laughed and we laughed. 
[02:08:00]  But then she started expecting me to break her gifts every year.  So then I did the unexpected.  I didn't break it.  Yeah.  I'm smart.  Yeah, what, the last gift she brought?  Because I remember every other one being broke.  It was a rock.  She would be crying.  I just wanted to bring you a present.  Oh.  So she's here and.  Just leave it in a diner like your mother left you.  Yeah, she's a foundling.  She's a foundling.  What are they thinking?  Foundling chat.  Foundling chat. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, the stalker Patty story again.  Oh, Patty again.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  By the way, can we turn the heat down in here?  It is brutal.  My God, it's sweltering.  What is going on with the climate control?  We are just whiny bitches in here today.  No, it's really hot.  I'll admit, foundry chat, we are whiny bitches.  Yeah, but you just want the ability to control your own, like if it's too hot, you want  to just go, hey, there's the thermostat.  Let's give her a little click to the left.  It is really hot.  Open the door.  Just keep the door open.  I don't care if there's some. 
[02:09:00]  Some ambient noise.  Yeah, I don't give a crap.  So I'm walking to the bathroom and Patty has to follow me.  She's like, I have to take my asthma medication while I'm here.  She's like a Yorkie.  She's like a Yorkshire Terrier.  All backed up and asthmatic.  All right, well, we'll get Stalker Patty in here in a few minutes, but first, an old  friend of the program, hopefully he's there.  He's been waiting a long time.  It's, uh, you remember Pat, Anthony?  It's Pat Croce.  Of course.  Pat?  Yo, guys.  There he is.  Long time no talk to. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, hi, Pat.  We kind of had a problem there, Pat.  You know, I was your last guest.  Were you?  I was your very last guest because all stuff hit the fan at the end of that show.  I had no idea what was going on.  And what were you talking about that day?  The church.  No, I know.  Well, you were.  Oh, I think I was promoting a book or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were.  I can't remember.  All of a sudden, I was one of your last guests that day and boom.  Yeah, Pat Croce has always been a friend of the show.  Yep.  And now we're seeing you on TV, huh, Pat? 
[02:10:00]  That's pretty funny.  Only in America, right?  Yeah, I was flipping through the channels and there he is, Pat Croce.  I get to move into different people's homes and help them resolve issues, conflicts,  problems every day in a different town in a different city.  Yeah, the bus pulls up.  Pat comes walking off and he moves into the house with the family like you're really living  with the family, by the way.  And I don't live with them.  Obviously, I live in a hotel.  I live in a hotel.  You live in a hotel getting back rubs and stuff while the camera crew sets up the next shot for you.  Once I'm there in the morning, guys, I go in early in the morning. 
[02:10:30]  Don't leave until like 5 or 6 at night.  It's a 30-minute show.  It's an awful lot of film with five cameras.  How much time do you spend with the family, actually, all said?  The whole day.  Okay.  I've seen women just crying, hugging Pat, saying,  you've totally solved my problems.  It's pretty amazing.  What's one of the issues you've resolved with one of these families?  Well, you know what?  Let me give you a non-family one.  You guys will love this.  Down in South Central L.A., Crenshaw.  Two warring tattoo parlors on the same block. 
[02:11:00]  These brothers wanted nothing to do with each other, crips and bloods,  and I had to go back and forth to try to bring them together at a neighborhood barbershop.  Are you crazy, Pat?  I thought I was after that.  My staff was going to quit.  It worked.  It worked.  Well, yeah, sure it worked.  Let's see what they're doing now.  Well, they're still alive.  Yeah, they're having barbecues with each other right now.  I think his coaching skills came into play there.  You're right.  Well, you know, when you're dealing with Allen Iverson and Larry Brown for five years,  you get a little education. 
[02:11:30]  Man, how did you feel about the big brawl?  I thought it was nasty.  I was mortified.  I felt really bad for David Stern because he's a friend of mine,  and I was thanking the Lord that I wasn't in the league anymore because I knew.  Even then, the next day, I must have got a dozen calls from everyone from ESPN,  and I said, nope, nothing to do with it.  I thought it was bad, man.  And no spectator should throw anything on the court.  But then again, get them ejected, suspend their season tickets, whatever it is.  But no player should go into this dance. 
[02:12:00]  Never.  Yeah.  It's totally wrong.  A lot of people came out and said that these guys make so much money.  I don't think I agree with this, but they said that these players make so much money  that they should be able to take some fan abuse and maybe a beer every once in a while  and should be able to just kind of look the other way.  They should be able to take fan verbal abuse, but no one should throw anything at them  because, you know, I've lived in that arena for, what, 15 years as a trainer  and then five years as an owner-president.  And no, man, you hate when the fans get nutty,  except that some of these players you really do want to verbally abuse them. 
[02:12:30]  I know what the feeling's like, but no way.  Nothing thrown on the court.  No physical abuse.  None whatsoever.  But, again, Opie and Anthony, no player has the right to go put their hands on anyone.  Oh, hell no.  I got a question for you, Pat, too.  It's about one of the first instances that happened was the Vernon Maxwell when he ran in.  Now, he said a fan said something about his daughter who had passed away.  Was that true?  Oh, yeah.  Don't say, oh, listen, they will say everything and anything.  And some of the worst fans that I've tolerated were in Indiana. 
[02:13:00]  I mean, they abused my family.  They abused everything.  I'm sitting in the stands.  They're doing everything possible to try to instigate a fight with me.  And at times, I would stand up and take them all on.  But they don't want to fight you.  They just want to abuse you.  Right.  They don't want to fight you.  You're a fourth-degree black belt.  Yeah, you're like some karate champion, I think.  Did you guys hear me do the Olympics?  I was a commentator for the Taekwondo and the Olympics, and she was wild.  Why didn't I see the Taekwondo? 
[02:13:30]  We didn't see that.  Was that on, like, four in the morning or something?  I think it was on during that beach volleyball.  I think they opted for the beach volleyball.  I was going to say, hmm, Taekwondo or girls in really, really tiny bathing suits jumping  up and down and diving in the sand.  You weren't competing with Survivor, were you?  Because Opie was with Harvey Fierstein curled up under a blanket enjoying the finale.  Oh, my gosh.  That was a long way, bro.  A long way.  Did you guys hear about my pirate museum? 
[02:14:00]  No.  What's going on with the pirate museum?  In Key West.  I opened it up January 5th.  I've been working on this a little over a year.  I'm opening an unbelievable $10 million pirate museum called Pirate Soul.  A real pirate museum?  A real.  No, this is real.  I have, you guys didn't know this, but I have the largest collection of piratical artifacts  in the world.  What a cool collection, man.  If I look at them, I'm taking you back 300 years in time.  I've got guys from all over the country, guys who worked with Disney and Universal, guys  who created the Holocaust Museum, guys who created the International Spy Museum in Washington. 
[02:14:30]  I put the best group together and created what will blow your mind away.  That's kind of cool stuff.  I know.  You're going to love this.  What do you have?  What are some of the prized possessions?  You've got some doubloons.  Captain Kidd's last journal.  Wow.  I have Blackbeard's Blunderbuss, his charger from his...  Cell phone?  From his...  Holy jeez, that's funny.  Not his charger from his cell phone. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  There's more sarcastic humor.  I'm sorry.  You know, they didn't have cell phones back then.  God damn, that's funny.  All right, wait.  So what else?  A charger is a big plate.  Right.  Oh, okay.  So you have all this stuff in the...  Wow.  That's really cool.  Where'd you get this?  I got one of two Jolly Roger flags in the world.  There's only one in the Finnish Museum of mine.  You must have a great metal detector.  Oh, yeah.  No, this is cool.  I mean, how do you get this stuff?  Seriously.  Whether it be auctions or private collections from people who collect crazy stuff, 
[02:15:30]  like me.  What's the most you've ever paid for a piece?  100 grand.  100 grand?  What was it?  The only treasure chest was Providence.  I got a treasure chest.  A real treasure chest.  A real.  Arr.  Real.  What's with Providence mean?  It means it has all the paperwork, the history.  Oh, wow.  That is really cool.  This is way, way cool.  What kind of stuff is in that journal?  It talks about it being captured.  Really?  You should see the writing. 
[02:16:00]  It's in 1699.  1699.  I love that stuff, man.  I got, you know what else?  I have, I mean, Queen Anne's pistols.  I mean, all kinds of really cool stuff.  But it's what I do with you when you're in there, when you walk down the streets of Port  Royal on deck, and then you're getting boarded.  I had Hollywood create a movie flick.  On deck, the ship has base chambers underneath it, and the deck is shaking, and the pirates  are boarding.  I say, man, it's a three-camera shoot coming at you.  Then I take you below deck and put these three-dimensional earphones on, and you go for a three-and-a-half 
[02:16:30]  minute show at Blackbeard's Last Battle, in the dark.  He's into everything.  Now, this is way cool.  I know.  This guy just loves to be alive.  Now, listen, guys.  Listen, this is the best part.  Yeah, go ahead.  Next door, I bought the building next door.  This is right in Key West.  We opened January 5th, but next door, I'm building the Rum Barrel Bar and Restaurant, and I'm  going to have an ISDN line.  You've got to do your show from there.  Holy S. Make sure you talk to Ben after this interview.  We'll be down there.  You just tell us when.  Key West.  Key West. 
[02:17:00]  I hear it's chilly down there.  Close optional.  Close optional, Opie.  Hey, maybe XM can get a wagon for someone to pull us in.  Do the wagon tour, guys.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, we'll do that in a second.  I mean, you've got to promise you've got to be there, though.  Oh, I'll be there.  No, no, we'll make sure.  I stopped filming moving in in March, and the Rum Barrel Bar and Restaurant won't open  until probably the summertime.  Pirate Soul, obviously, the museum opens January 5th, but yeah, so summertime on. 
[02:17:30]  Very cool.  Summertime, good.  We'll make plane reservations for the fall, then, here at XM.  Jesus.  Yeah, well, the other thing I want to talk about, what's going on with Slam Ball?  Are you still involved with that?  I'm still involved.  Right now, Mike Cohen and Mason Gordon, the very creators.  You want to explain Slam Ball?  I absolutely love this damn thing.  Slam Ball is four on four on a spring-loaded court where there's four trampolines on either  end of the court within the three-point circle, and it's full contact.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, so you can fly, you can dribble down the court, and then you hit the tramp, and 
[02:18:00]  you are the dribble, and you can get elbow above backboard, and the opposing team  can take you out full contact.  Yeah, dude, some of these guys get like 15, 16, 17 feet in the air, and then they just  get slammed in midair by another animal.  Yeah, I've seen it.  It's pretty cool.  And some of these guys, you know, they'll hit the trampoline, and then they'll do like  360 flips.  I mean, like head over heels, basically.  Yeah, they're trying to make it kind of like, it's the first extreme team sport, but what  we're trying to do is make it an eight to ten city real league, you know, like arena 
[02:18:30]  football.  It's not really taking off yet.  Why?  Well, it's just tough.  We try to get, we're going to try to get a big television sponsor, because we got, Shaq  wants to do a team in Orlando, Snoop Dogg wants a team in L.A., Wolf of Law and Order  wants it up in New York.  I'd take Philadelphia, but we need one of those television networks to come in as a partner.  I hear you.  Speaking of Shaq, Shaq versus Kobe, they're starting to talk about like it's the biggest  thing to hit sports in years.  Four days.  And I was just watching ESPN like four days before Shaq versus Kobe. 
[02:19:00]  It'll be a nothing.  It will, right?  It'll be a nothing.  Yeah, it's going to be a game because you're going to see Shaq, you know, take off on the  paint, but you know, it's nothing.  It's not like they're two championship teams.  Let me ask you a question.  I mean, like, I'm so sick and tired.  I like the Lakers, but it seems like Kobe Bryant is just being a prima donna and a baby.  How do you let Phil Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal both walk away from your team?  I don't know if he had the power to do that, but you got to ask Jerry Buss.  And I was watching Jerry Buss interview the owner, and he said he wanted a run-and-gun  type of team.  He was tired of what he saw before, but I don't understand. 
[02:19:30]  I don't have a ring, and I would love to do anything.  They could walk as slow down the court as they want.  That 350-pound monster can crawl down the court as long as he brings me a ring.  Yeah, exactly.  How do you let Shaquille walk?  I have no idea.  By the way, that was like when Chicago let Michael Jordan go.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Because, well, they had a clue.  It's all about egos, though, you know?  Yep.  Before we let you go, Pat, we can't let you off the hook.  You've got to admit, some of the footage from the fight was just hilarious.  From the Detroit brawl? 
[02:20:00]  That was hilarious, some of the stuff that was going on there, man.  How about the big African-American that was sneaking up behind the players and whacking them?  Yeah.  That was, I put him in the stand.  I mean, and then the one guy on the court who's, Artest came flying at him, and then  O'Neal came flying at him.  Yeah.  I mean, it was like rock'em, sock'em.  Yeah, he didn't know what was going on.  Oh, yeah.  And one of our favorites was the sliding punch by Jermaine O'Neal.  That was classic.  Oh, my goodness.  I mean, yeah, all right, it's wrong, blah, blah, blah.  But that footage, I mean, I can't get enough of it. 
[02:20:30]  Every time they show it, you know, we have TVs on in the studio.  Every time they show it, the show stops so we can see a different angle from it.  It was wrong, because no players, I mean, they shouldn't be fighting, but, and even if,  and they definitely shouldn't be fighting when they don't know how to fight.  Hey, Pat, did you notice that Artest seemed to be very angry at the soda thrower, but he  didn't really seem to want to throw a punch at Ben Wallace?  That's true.  That's very true.  Yeah.  He backed out.  I think because that soda woke him up from his nap. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ben Wallace.  He was napping on that scores table.  So, are you ever going to get back in the NBA?  I don't think so, but I never say never.  You don't know.  No, you're too busy with the pirate thing.  Yeah, I got something cool.  Moving in, the TV show in the Pirate Museum, right now I got my hands full.  I'm the busiest retired guy you ever met.  Pat, you know we love you.  Yeah, I just have a tough time watching the show, because it seems like it's more geared  toward, I don't know, the...  Oh, it is.  Women.  Yeah, thank you.  It is.  It's daytime TV.  Yeah, the fat housewives from the Midwest. 
[02:21:30]  Well, they're not all fat, but it's daytime TV, and it's for getting people motivated.  So, yeah, it's hard, because it is.  You know, with daytime TV, you've got to really make sure that I can't go nuts on  someone, otherwise...  Oh, do you want to smack some of them and go, stop whining?  Oh my goodness, are you kidding me?  I'm going to think about a collar and throw them out the window.  A bunch of whiners.  What you don't see is me getting in their face saying, don't play that game with me.  Yeah.  How many times do you get back on the bus and go, thank God that one's over with? 
[02:22:00]  A lot.  And Pat's such a man's man.  I mean, he likes karate and pirates and basketball.  Anything that men do, he's involved with.  Man's man.  You ever see his leg?  It's the leg, right?  From the motorcycle accident?  Holy ass.  Wow, yeah.  I remember that.  Still can work out and still kick.  Oh, I know, I know.  It looks a little strange, but it does the job for you.  It's like a war wound.  It really is.  All right.  So I'm glad to see you guys surviving, surviving, because when they said you want to do open  anthony, I said, come on, they're my buddies.  Hell yeah.  I love to do their show. 
[02:22:30]  Cool.  Well, keep in touch.  We're down for the whole pirate museum thing.  Down on it, man.  Hell yeah.  Key West.  January 5th it opens.  January 5th.  Anyone can just check it out, piratesoul.com.  All right.  Anything else you need to plug today, Pat?  Oh, man.  All right.  It's good to hear from you guys.  You too.  We'll talk to you soon.  See you.  See you.  Take it easy.  Bye, Mr. Croce.  Bye, Steve Blood.  All right.  There he goes.  Pat Croce.  Motivational.  He's very motivational on that show that he does.  I saw some, like Opie said, big fat housewife, and she's just crying her eyes out and hugging 
[02:23:00]  Pat.  And Pat, you know, he puts on the good face for the show, but you know he's just like,  oh, get this blubbering fat bag off of me.  Get me on the bus.  My theory is simple.  You can't help people.  No.  You just can't.  I gave up.  How many people are in your lives where you know what they need to do and you tell them  a million times and you just know nothing works and you might as well talk to the wall?  Patty's gotten herself back into shape. 
[02:23:30]  But that's not because we've been motivational toward her.  No.  She decided on her own to make her life better.  That's great.  You must decide on your own.  She's a rare exception, I think.  Yeah.  Most people in your lives, you know, you know, they come to you like, oh, and you have the  same conversation over and over and over again.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  So what I'm thinking is Pat Croce might help these families literally for the time he's  there.  But within a week, it's kind of like the glamour shows and like Swan and all that. 
[02:24:00]  We were discussing this the other day.  You know?  Well, as soon as they go back to their regular lives, they're going back to their their local  beauty parlor and and all of a sudden that really nice hairdo they had or the make up.  From the Hollywood hairdo guy and it's all the make up.  It just goes back to what they're used to and nothing ever changes.  Stop whining.  In most people's lives.  Stop whining.  You lack discipline.  Yes.  Yes.  It's time now to turn this mush into muscles. 
[02:24:30]  It's time now to turn that mush.  Yeah.  It's not a tumor.  Yeah.  It's not a tumor.  Hey, we have another guest coming on the show today.  Stop.  Yes.  Serious.  Serious questions only.  Serious questions only.  Oh, oh.  OK, very good.  And what is this?  She's got a book.  The best love you'll ever have.  Oh, OK.  What's that about?  I don't know.  Steve knows.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, it could be fun. 
[02:25:00]  Are you making fun of Steve's booking?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  All right.  It's serious questions only.  That's all.  That's at 9 o'clock.  Yeah, no stupid questions on the instant feedback and no ridiculous questions on the phone.  Only serious questions.  You got to.  Real questions.  Real questions for this lady.  Do we have a little synopsis?  Do you understand sarcasm?  The devil.  Do we have a synopsis of the book?  Yeah.  They're getting Steve.  I can tell a lot from the title. 
[02:25:30]  But, you know, what are her credentials?  How do you listen to a comedy program and not get sarcasm?  Because you're sitting in a chat room at 6 in the morning is how.  I would almost understand anything else.  Maybe you don't find something fun.  That's fine.  Uh-huh.  But when it comes to comedy, there's a lot of sarcasm involved.  Comedy.  Something was strangely absent.  Hey, Steve.  Comedy.  What's this guest that's coming in at night?  Yeah.  Oh, she's calling in.  She's calling in.  Her name's Shannon Mullen.  What's my Steve song? 
[02:26:00]  Uh, get on with Steve songs.  Uh, her name is Shannon Mullen.  She wrote a book called The Best You'll Ever Have.  What every woman should know about getting and giving knock-your-socks-off sex.  Oh, another one of these, huh?  Yeah.  They love writing books, these women.  Knock-your-socks-off.  Yeah, this one hounded me for a while to get on, so I figured, you know.  How not to spill coffee in a diner.  Yeah.  Uh.  What's coffee?  Coffee.  There you go.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Coffee diva.  She spilled my coffee. 
[02:26:30]  I'm glad you like that.  Uh.  C-A-H.  That's right.  It's 14-H-D.  Oh.  14-H-D.  It's 14-H-D.  Yeah.  That was Drew that did that?  Yeah.  Drew Bogie.  That's the man.  I'm going to hit him.  Synthesize.  Um.  Synthesizer diva.  Any, any, like, um, I don't know, lines from the thing?  Yeah, bullet points.  Good point.  She has a master's degree in social anthropology. 
[02:27:00]  Uh.  And she's a former advertising executive.  She'll, um.  Ooh.  Discuss foolproof illustrated directions for locating the G-Spot and other erogenous zones.  Yeah, this old gag again.  Yep.  Uh.  No-nonsense guide to the best sex toys.  God, let's save the time.  G-Spot.  Two and a half inches in toward the belly button.  All right.  Good night.  Check, please.  You ever been, like, looking for it, though, and you can't feel the little button?  I have little hands.  We're not talking about the button.  We're talking about the spongy.  Yeah.  The spot.  The spongy area.  Inside, yeah.  Yeah.  What?  What? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, no.  Sorry.  I was just going to tell us how to find that, huh?  All right.  Sorry.  You want to see Patrice with his long fingers working on that?  He's got those awful long fingers.  You watched Patrice try to find a G-Spot on a ship?  No, I watched him find one on a prostitute in Rio.  Me and Keith Robinson just stood there watching as he brought, like, glass dildos to Rio, and  he would work on these girls and get them off, and they didn't want to get off, but he had  a vibe.  It was disgusting.  That must just look like she fell over the railing at the gorilla pit, and she's just  being mauled. 
[02:28:00]  I'm sorry.  He is just big.  He was on his knees in a creepy fashion, and he just touched Patner's stomach going,  como, como, like, for her to be calm.  Oh, God, how creepy.  It was, he's such a creep.  That is awful.  But he was working the dildo and the vibrator, and he had the fingers in the, because he  had those long, long fingers, and I got to give him credit, he got them off.  It's sexier, that scene in Saving Private Ryan when the big Nazi's stabbing the American  guy going, shh, shh, slowly putting the knife into his chest. 
[02:28:30]  That's what it sounds like.  That's how creepy Patrice is.  Como.  Como.  Como.  Como.  Patting her stomach like Caligula did before, ah, when he slapped Livia's stomach before  he put a fist in her husband's backside.  Up, proculus.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Steve.  She'll also discuss the difference between a clitoris and a penis.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we need that information.  Yeah, exactly.  Just in case you're with somebody, eating some cheese, wine, watching Survivor.  You might not be sure. 
[02:29:00]  When you tell yourself, this is just like a big clitoris.  Does penis size matter?  Is another thing she talks about.  Also, there are several...  All kinds of questions that have never been answered.  Exactly.  Or asked, yeah.  Detailed diagrams of female and male sex organs throughout the book.  Oh.  All right, so we'll go with the serious questions only.  Of course.  Serious questions only, folks.  All right.  And that's coming up at 9 o'clock.  Can't wait.  Thank you, Steve.  It's Martini, Steve.  Martini, Steve. 
[02:29:30]  It's Martini, Steve.  I don't want anybody named Lil' Connor calling in or none of that nonsense.  Right, right.  Lil' Connor shouldn't be a name that was calling in with a question for her.  When is she checking in?  Nine.  Nine.  All right, we'll step aside.  Another Christmas song here from South Park.  I like this one.  What?  A Christmas song.  Like the holidays.  Yes.  Yeah.  We're in the holiday mode now.  Leroy, the big lip nigger. 
[02:30:00]  What the hell was that?  What the hell was that?  That's a John Valby song.  Was that John Valby?  Yeah.  Dude, you know how sometimes, whatever, we'll play little games here and stuff.  Wow.  I swear to God, that was a mistake.  Why was that?  What is that labeled?  I swear it jumped to track four.  I wanted track three.  Why is that? 
[02:30:30]  I've got to be honest with you.  Steve has brought in.  Steve has major problems.  Well, since we've had the guys from Panzerfaust on, the guy from Panzerfaust who does some racism,  heavy rock music, and we found some of the stuff he did entertaining in this weird, you know,  racist kind of way, Steve has just come to the table with so much racist dribble.  And it's all over the place here, and it's on other CDs, so I think he's purposely sneaking 
[02:31:00]  mixing it in onto other things.  He definitely wants us to play this stuff.  This is a good one.  This is Jew killer sung to the theme of memories.  Wow.  I wish I could say that was accurate, but the reality is I was running out of CD-Rs at home  and had to figure out a way to get all this effing audio onto some deliverable meme.  Steve, Steve.  Kamo.  Kamo, Steve.  Kamo.  Let me just...  What is CD-Rs?  What is CD-Rs?  Kloons, Dinks, and Ruskies?  Oh, jeez.  What a fuck. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, so Steve brought in Valby's Leroy, the big lipped.  Yeah.  Also here today is Who Likes a...  Followed by Ship Those Back, and We Is Not Violet.  Jesus.  Jesus, the last two came off the 45s and showed up.  Yeah, he found them on 45s.  Yeah, right up there.  On 45.  They're right up there.  That's great. 
[02:32:00]  Well, let's...  Maybe we'll play these later to show how racist Steve is.  I don't know.  1964?  Wait a minute.  If I could find an angle, we'll play them.  Oh, that's a big hit.  1964, 45.  That's probably a collector's item.  It is.  Dude, these are really cool.  Hate nanny record, 1964.  Hate nanny?  Yeah.  We as non-violent niggers.  Wow.  I mean, this is probably worth money.  You should actually...  That's funny.  Hoot nanny.  Hate nanny.  I'm not putting that on eBay, thanks.  You want to put that on eBay?  No.  Why?  You put it on eBay.  Why not?  Go ahead.  I don't care.  Hold on a second. 
[02:32:30]  Mudflap, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hi, Mudflap.  Thanks for calling the program.  Hey, no problem.  Hey, go ahead.  Play that song.  It just doesn't make fun of niggers.  It makes fun of daggers, too.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It's a great song.  I don't like that type of language.  I happen to have my young producer and his big hog in the car.  Oh, well, then you can always just turn the volume down if you don't want to listen to it.  All right, thank you, Mudflap.  We were just like, Opie hits the button. 
[02:33:00]  I swear that was so.  We take our headphones off, and I hear that.  I'm like, what the?  What?  What are you doing?  Well, this stuff is.  Christmas song?  This stuff is all in front of me, and, you know, it's here, and I was thinking maybe,  you know, if we found some kind of angle, maybe we'll throw this crap on the air.  Hey, boy.  Now we found it.  Won't you play that song, boy?  Now we found the angle, I guess.  Kevin in San Francisco, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Welcome to the Mengele and Anthony show.  Hey, Opie, could you play that song, please? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, see, now the phones have just exploded.  We got Frank here.  What's up, Frank?  Hey, guys, man.  You got to play that song.  See, now we have to play the song now, Anthony.  Is it Johnny Rebel, or it says that's Johnny Rebel, not John Valby.  It is John Valby, though.  Valby.  This is definitely Valby.  All right.  I've actually heard him.  Live.  Yeah.  All right, well, let's hear it.  Is there any setup here, Anthony?  No setup at all.  From the first line, it sounds like an awful song. 
[02:34:00]  I don't know.  It's a number called Leroy the Big Lip Nigger, and it's a parody of how African Americans are  viewed in this country.  Wow.  Jeez.  By John Valby.  That's going to help us?  All right, well, and then I want to play Merry F'n Christmas.  So because we're lazy today, it's on the same CD, you might hear like five seconds of dead  air in between the songs, so we can do it two for one.  If you're driving and you're above Central Park, turn your radio down or roll your windows up.  Oh, you shouldn't have said that.  You've been warned.  You should have told them to turn this up, folks. 
[02:34:30]  You're going to have a lot of laughs.  A lot of laughs uptown.  Yeah, we got to warn you.  This could get you punched in the face.  Yes.  Crank it.  Yes, please be conscious and sensitive to others that may be listening to your radio  right now.  You thought you'd be the cool guy to bring in your XM satellite radio so everyone could  enjoy the fine humor that is the Opie and Anthony program on 202.  You may want to turn it down at this point.  There's a guy at a forklift somewhere in the middle of a warehouse going, no!  Running in slow motion. 
[02:35:00]  Leroy the Big Lip Nigger  Nigger  Also had a push-in nose  And if he took his boots off  You could even see eleven toes  All of the other Negroes  Used to laugh and call him Bumbles  They would let poor Leroy  Join in any Negro rumbles  Then one balmy summer's eve 
[02:35:30]  Some dagos came to town  Beating up Polack  Stopping on niggers  Spreading grease all around  Leroy the Big Lip Nigger  Was polish in his Cadillac car  Some grease spattered on his windshield  He said you geezer gone to fuckin' bar  Two little guineas  Two little guineas hit the ground  FOMO went and ran  There stood Leroy 
[02:36:00]  There stood Leroy  There stood Leroy wiggling his lips  With a shotgun in his hand  Leroy the Big Lip Nigger  Got set up for twenty years  But Leroy is not alone there  His cellmate's a Polack with great big ears  So each in the morning and fuck you  Okay terrific  All right  John Palby  Yeah there you have it  Father Trucker  What's up Father Trucker 
[02:36:30]  I was wanting to know  Why he was going over the edge  Like he used to do every single day  This is the firstest closest thing  I've heard y'all do  Over the edge  Since Monday  Last time y'all went over the edge  You didn't hear yesterday's show  We were pretty edgy yesterday sir  Yesterday was a little much  I listened about two and a half hours yesterday  And then I changed a comedy channel  Because it wasn't going nowhere  Sir if you're edgy every day 
[02:37:00]  It all of a sudden isn't the edge  It's the middle  It's got to be organic  You can't make it try to be edgy  Whatever you're doing  It's got to be  You know what I mean  Whatever fits in the moment  Yeah  He doesn't know what organic means  Except  O.P. Anthony and Jimmy  Can go to the edge every day  And a new level  I got faith in you boys  Alright Mike  You can't do the crystal meth every day  You'll burn out  Let's hear what  Father Trucker  What do you want to hear of the program?  Oh I'm up for whatever y'all got going on  But just bring it to the edge every day  Like y'all usually do 
[02:37:30]  How does he get foundry chat in his truck  Is what I want to know  Alright Father Trucker  Thank you  Merry Christmas to you and your fellow truckers  Merry Christmas  Merry Christmas  Bye sweetie  I love the truckers that have the Christmas lights  Oh they decorate their trucks up with Christmas lights  That's right  Then they do coke and drive for 34 straight hours  And crank  At 95 miles an hour  They don't like those stereotypes remember?  Crank off a map  That's funny  Yeah  And I stepped on it  I'm sorry 
[02:38:00]  That's alright  I made it through  We're all just chitting and chatting  It's got a little footprint on it  But it made it  Yeah it happens  It's like a wife who kind of listens  Can't have a shoe print on her  Alright why don't we  Why don't we play another Christmas song?  Oh you want to play another one huh?  Well I want to play the one that I meant to play  And then uh  We need another one  Was that one?  Was that a Christmas song?  Yeah  It was done to a Christmas song  And then um  We'll talk to Starker Patty  What's this called?  Deck the halls with gook ears?  I heard there is no Christmas  In the silly Middle East 
[02:38:30]  No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus  They have different religious beliefs  They believe in Muhammad  And not in our holiday  And so every December  I go to the Middle East  And say  Hey there Mr. Muslim  Merry fucking Christmas  Put down that book the Koran  And here's some holiday wishes  In case you haven't noticed  It's Jesus' birthday  So get off your heathen Muslim ass  And fucking celebrate 
[02:39:00]  There is no holiday season  In India I've heard  They don't hang up their stockings  And that is just absurd  They never read a Christmas story  They don't know what Rudolph is about  And that is why in December  I'll go to India  And shout  Hey there Mr. Hinduist  Merry fucking Christmas  Drink eggnog and eat some beef  And pass it to the missus  In case you haven't noticed  It's Jesus' birthday 
[02:39:30]  So get off your heathen Hindu ass  And fucking celebrate  Now I heard that in Japan  Everyone just lives in sin  They pray to several gods  And put needles in their skin  On December 25th  All they do is eat a cake  And that is why I go to Japan  And walk around and  Hi  Hi there Mr. Shintoist  Merry fucking Christmas  God is gonna kick your ass  You infidelic pagan scum  In case you haven't noticed 
[02:40:00]  There's festive things to do  So let's all rejoice for Jesus  Merry fucking Christmas you  On Christmas Day  I travel around the world and say  Now it's Christmas bonus  And all you atheists too  Merry fucking Christmas  To you  All I want is to get laid  And eat sandwiches  That's it  That's the closest reference 
[02:40:30]  You can get to something  Cool, hip and groovy  Cool, hip and groovy  Ha ha ha  Dick  Yeah  Where do you go when you're ready  To change the locks?  See I'll be there for the show  I wanna be on you  Well you've come to the right place  I help you  You help me  We all laugh  Don't worry we're not listening  Cause this is a boring conversation  I love you too sweetie  As you walk past them  Don't take your jewelry  Take your purse  Or whatever you know  You have no idea what they are  There are a lot of questions about them  Real  Dirty looking  Pinky not  Shut up  Bring on the booze  This is the LB and Anthony show

[02:43:00]  He shoots  That's his  ACC basketball  It's the ACC today  Tie your shoes nice and tight  Because ACC basketball is breaking you down  You better box your man out  Because we're grabbing the boards  Round ball baby  It's the ACC today  On XM Satellite Radio  It's Wednesday  The 22nd of December 2004  I'm Maury Bykovsky  With the ACC today 
[02:43:30]  5th ranked Wake Forest  Has not had the easiest schedule in the world  Head coach Skip Prosser  Makes sense of how he scheduled the season  When you play a national schedule  It behooves you I think  To try to play different styles of teams  You know the Temple style  Is different than the style  We face today against Texas  And your ability or inability  I think to adapt to those  Different styles  I think is something that could serve you well  Or not in March  And while some would question 
[02:44:00]  The sanity of the coach  Who put this schedule together  Including my wife  On a daily basis  I'm hoping it prepares us  For the ACC  Because we'll play so many good teams  That play different styles  And hopefully beyond  Wake Forest is ranked  5th in the AP  4th in the coaches  With a 9-1 overall record  Largest of the night  Swan from the right  Deep right side  With a three-pointer  And he knocks it down  Right corner  Long range three-pointer  Rims in and out  No good  The rebound to Maryland  And the Terrapins win it 
[02:44:30]  Terrapins sports marketing  On the call  Maryland survived  By the skin of their teeth  In their last outing  As they opened conference play  Against Florida State  Winning out 90-88  Maryland this week  Is ranked 24th in the AP  21st in the coaches  They need to step their game up  Because tomorrow  They take on  American University  Team is playing some ball  Yes I said  American University  AU  The two D.C. Metro schools  Face off on ACC Channel 183  At 8 p.m. Eastern  And that's the ACC Today 
[02:45:00]  On XM Satellite Radio  The O.B. and Anthony Show  By the way

[02:46:30]  Of this show today  So far  But if they play  You leading into  A Christmas song  Do they play  Straight up  Rudolph the Mid-Dosin  Rain Deer  And you guys  Sound like pussies  And I'm just kidding  I'm not serious about that  I just would love to hear  How they handle  Editing the show  That's all  I think they'll know  What they're doing  That's what  We're trying to say  We're going to do  Our XM Satellite Radio show  And if someone out there  Is smart enough  And I think there  Are radio people out there  Smart enough  They can take this  Edit it  And make it  Make sense  And keep our  Respectability  Yeah I think  It'll still be a good show 
[02:47:00]  It'll just be interesting  To hear the difference  And there's no question  I'm getting a much  Different and better show  The Reverend show  Yeah no  I mean the XM Satellite Radio  Is the way to go  In the end  So thank you John  Alright thanks man  Bye bye  Thanks John  Yeah because a lot of  People are paranoid  The show's not going to change  Thank you John  Futtbucker  What's up  Futtbucker  His name is  Futtbucker  You make fine burgers  In your restaurant Shane  Hey I'll tell you  We played that  John Valvey song  In downtown Detroit

[02:49:30]  I would love that  Oh  I've always wanted  To go to Chippendales  But they closed in 1983  Yeah  Or any  Or someplace like that  Just one of those  Nude male dancer things  What would you do  They wave their junk  In the girls faces  I would probably just  I don't know  Stare  I wouldn't know  What to say  You know what they do  To birthday girls  At those things  I've heard stories  Really  They take them up  On stage  They pretty much  Shove their junk  Right in the girls faces 
[02:50:00]  I don't know  You would be into that  I don't know  I've never experienced that  It would be something  Quite new  But you know  For the second half  Of my life  It would be a beginning  What do you think  You're not going to live  To be a hundred  What's the matter  With you  You were taking  Asthma medication  Before you came in here  How are you going to  Get to a hundred  The second half  Of your life  Started when you were 29  Well last week  I had a four and a half  Hour physical  With everything  Sonograms of my heart  Everything  The only thing  They found really

[03:15:30]  It's ho-ho-ho-y. 
[03:16:00]  It's Gary Hoey.  On the ONA show, we like to call it the virus.  Rock.  And we got Shannon McCollinger.  Author of The Best You'll Ever Have, What Every Woman Should Know About Getting and Giving, Knock Your Socks Off Sex. 
[03:16:30]  So is it going to be the whole, hi guys, how you doing?  The perky, very up.  I think she'll be very business-like.  You think?  Yes.  I think they have to be like, hi.  Well, this book is going to teach everyone what they really need to know to spice it up in the bed.  Shut up.  How many copies of the book do we have, Ben?  Just one.  That's good.  Yeah.  Let one person peruse it. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I love this new bit.  It's a Jimmy bit.  It's Harry and the pages.  Yeah.  I do love that bit.  I love this bit.  They don't understand what's going on.  Oh, oh, oh.  Thanks, buddy.  Yes.  Oh, wait.  Jimmy, can I have that book?  I think we have our sexpert on the line here.  Let me just, I'm just perusing the Shannon Mullen.  Cool.  Hold on.  I got to see the book.  All right.  No, I don't.  We're trying to get her on the phone right now.  All right. 
[03:17:30]  This is a little, like a one sheet on the best you'll ever have.  What every woman should know about getting and giving Knock Your Socks Off Sex by Shannon Mullen.  Here you go.  This is the picture.  And I do believe we have her on the line.  It's Shannon Mullen, right, Shannon?  Yep.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Welcome to the program.  Hi.  Thanks for having me on.  Oh, no problem.  When we found out that we were going to have you on the show, we got quite excited.  Oh, yeah.  We really did.  We love sex. 
[03:18:00]  LOL.  Who doesn't is right, you know?  So what's going on there, Shannon?  Not much.  The book is called The Best You'll Ever Have.  Yep.  With a very, very long subtitle.  Well, can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Hi, this is Connor.  It's myth number one.  You have a section here on sexual myths?  Uh-huh.  What is this about?  Tush sex is for gay men.  Oh.  Yeah, that's a big myth.  Oh, I think you were saying that it was... 
[03:18:30]  Oh, that's a myth.  Hold on.  Yeah, that's a myth.  I thought you were saying that it was...  I thought you were saying that it was actually only for gay men.  No, no.  That would be part of the myth list.  Oh, so that's something that is a knock-your-socks-off type of sex?  Yeah, that's actually something that I think people ought to talk about more.  For women, they think, well, why would I want something up my butt when I have a perfectly good vagina?  Right, exactly.  Especially if you're going to hit logs.  Yeah, so you have to kind of think it through and think why that makes sense in order to convince yourself to give it a go. 
[03:19:00]  And why does that make sense?  I'm not going to tend to like it.  Yeah, why does it make sense there, Shannon?  It makes sense for women because there's a muscle called the PC muscle that goes from your pubic bone to your tailbone, like a hammock.  Uh-huh.  And all of that muscle is filled with nerve endings.  Every human being who has an orgasm has their butt twitch, you know?  So it's all connected.  Anthony and I have this thing, though.  We think butt sex should be left for the young. 
[03:19:30]  How old is too old to have butt sex?  Right.  For the young only.  Yeah.  What about when you get old?  You're a bit saucy.  You're a bit saucy for our program, but that's okay.  There's actually a good line here, too.  This is pretty funny.  It's about the G-spot, and it says here, the search party begins.  Hold on, what page is this?  It says, break out the rubber gloves, kidding, about looking for the G-spot.  Now, hold on, this is page 51. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  Is that a problem that most men have?  Finding the G-spot?  That's a problem most women have, too.  So where is this?  Really?  So where is this G-spot?  Yeah, I'll tell you, because I finally came up with a way to explain it that I think is pretty simple.  There's a picture in the book that you can't misunderstand.  What page?  What page?  Yeah, what?  There's two pictures in a row.  Let me just flip through.  Hold on, I got it right here.  There's one with a finger.  With a finger.  I have page 49.  It's a diagram of the G-spot. 
[03:20:30]  Is that it?  That's right.  49 and 53.  Oh, two pages.  Hold on, hold on.  You look at 49, then you look at...  Let me get 49.  Hold on.  All right.  So we show it first, like, in relationship to what everyone knows.  Everyone knows the uterus and the ovary.  Right.  Because we had that in school.  So if you're going to explain anything, you have to show that.  Uh-huh.  It says here the G-spot.  It also has a picture of the bladder?  Yes.  Exactly.  The bladder.  Because at least we still have the bladder in our heads.  Uh-huh. 
[03:21:00]  Right.  And for women, the only thing they really remember is the tampon diagram.  True that.  Oh, yeah.  Every box of tampons comes with one of those.  Who doesn't know that?  The tampon diagram sucks.  So how do you find the G-spot?  You shove a couple fingers in there, and then what do you do?  Well, I would start with just one.  Just one.  Just one.  I'm going to shock.  That's true.  You don't need to lose your babysitting job right away.  You can reserve the rest of the hand for other activities.  Right, right, right.  So through that.  The motion is the come-hither motion.  Yeah.  Come over here.  Yeah.  So when you're doing that, stop halfway through and take a look at your hand from the side, 
[03:21:30]  and you'll see you're in, like, a perfect C shape.  Yeah.  A perfect C shape.  It's, like, two and a half inches in toward the belly button, right?  It's toward the belly button side, and it's very, like you said, like, two and a half inches.  It's the bottom one-third, so it's not very far in.  And if you press on the pubic bone, which is really the base of your jeans zipper, everyone has a pubic bone.  Yes, we do.  But behind the pubic bone for women is the G-spot.  So you're trying to get behind that bone. 
[03:22:00]  It's quite spongy, right?  It is.  It's, like, a ridgy, spongy.  It's erectile tissue.  So if she's in the right frame of mind, the G-spot's there, and you can feel it.  And if she's not in the right frame of mind, if she's nervous or uptight and just not ready yet, it won't really be very prominent.  And the main thing for women is they've felt it here and there, but it makes them nervous because it makes them feel like they're going to pee.  Oh, really?  They'll feel it, and they'll seize up and stop everything instead of knowing they're not going to pee, being able to relax. 
[03:22:30]  So we're going to lose the best orgasm to fear of peeing.  I like to call that G-spot Connor's headrest.  Yeah.  Headrest.  Yeah, our old Connor here in the studio.  I know.  I always, I'm afraid to go swimming, though.  I am, I, the book here, now, are you actually, is it released yet?  Yeah, it just came out.  Oh.  Time for Christmas.  Where can you get it?  Barnes & Noble, Amazon.  Make your local bookstores carry it. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Hold on.  Whoa, whoa.  There's Twitch talk.  There's actually, I'll say one thing.  I like the, there's a tremendous amount of, like, little headings at the top of every page.  So it's kind of like, almost like a food for thought type of book.  Oh.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, you want to go out and go fishing or something with your mom?  And, you know, if you're going to go fishing and maybe only one comes back and two don't.  Right.  How about here?  It says, don't hate, masturbate.  Oh. 
[03:23:30]  That's a pretty good story.  I got.  What's that about?  Well, I started this business called Safina.  Right.  About two years ago.  And, um, Safina is the in-home sex ed salon for women.  And we sell sex toys.  Oh.  Oh.  But we call them sexeries.  Accessories for your lost life.  Sexeries.  Like accessories, but only, but only, uh, sex.  Right.  I get it.  Right.  Accessories for your lost life.  I mean, the whole thing about sex in America is still, it's very awkward and uncomfortable. 
[03:24:00]  Like, tush talk.  I mean, the reason we call it that is so you can actually talk about your butt without feeling like a weird person.  Without feeling dirty.  Well, no one wants to listen to their tush.  Plus, it's breath stinks.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Oh.  All right.  Well, what else do you cover that could help us out in the, uh, in the bedroom?  Well, sex toys are something that almost every woman is interested in.  But they need permission to like them.  Uh-huh.  So, if you're married or you're in a long-term relationship, you really should get some. 
[03:24:30]  But make sure they're attractive.  Don't buy ugly things.  Sharon, what's the difference between a clit and a penis?  That's a good question.  What page is that?  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Sharon.  What page is that?  Let's see.  That's in the second chapter.  Connor wants to follow along in his own book.  Yes.  Like he followed along his mom to those depths of, well.  That's good.  It starts off explaining kind of where the clitoris is and what is it that is.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[03:25:00]  I'm looking for the diagram.  There's a great diagram of the difference between a clitoris and a penis.  Oh.  What page?  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  What page?  I'm trying to follow along in the book here.  Okay, here's a good page.  94.  Hold on, the cover keeps falling off.  Hold on.  All right, 94.  We're at page 94 here.  All right.  You'll be surprised at how similar the clitoris and the penis are.  Really?  In fact, they're almost exactly the same.  Well, if they're on Jamie Lee Curtis, they are. 
[03:25:30]  Even on your most average woman.  Well, Susan, obviously there's a difference in size, though.  I don't have a page here.  There is a big difference in size, but they operate exactly the same way.  You know, everyone starts off female.  This, I thought, was very surprising when I started this research.  At the seventh week, if you've got a Y chromosome, your vulva closes up, and it becomes testicles, and the clitoris grows.  Oh.  So everyone starts off the same.  So we actually have all the same exact stuff. 
[03:26:00]  And the clitoris operates exactly the same as the penis.  So when blood rushes to the region, the clitoris raises up and gets erect and sticks out from its foreskin.  How did you learn all this?  This took me about a year and a half.  That's it?  Well, that's all I did.  I interviewed doctors, urologists, dominatrixes, you know, people who know things.  Really?  Let me ask you a question.  Right here, I'm looking at page 150.  It says, I've never had an orgasm. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  These are stories of real women.  Why are you laughing at that?  Some girls don't have an orgasm.  I don't believe that.  A lot of people.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot.  I would say less than 10%.  My dad and mom would always fight.  And she would always.  My mom and I were talking one time.  I actually just heard the fight from inside the little womb I was staying in.  That day, like, she would never have orgasms.  Right.  I mean, I heard this.  It was kind of embarrassing as a kid to hear that.  But it's like, I think times have changed now.  Well, I think men are more in tune with making a woman have an orgasm. 
[03:27:00]  Am I right or wrong?  See, Connor's very interested in your book and learning all he can.  I mean, I just know he's, you know, soaking up every bit of information he can and just  tearing through it.  Yeah.  That's good.  That means he's actually interested in women.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I am.  I'm very attached to my mother.  I think everyone is for me.  You know?  Because this orgasm thing is not a small problem.  I mean, when I say 10%, I think I'm being conservative.  Wow.  Wow.  Safina.  So, Safina, what kind of advice could you give to the ladies that don't get the orgasms 
[03:27:30]  there?  Yeah, orgasms really do start in mind.  Uh-huh.  What's that?  I couldn't hear that.  It's very, very important to just relax.  Just relax.  And that's part.  Calm all.  Most of the time, if you haven't had an orgasm by the time you're in your 20s, you're pretty  frustrated.  Can't you just get them really...  Calm all.  Can't you get them just really drunk?  Will that help?  Oh, what about alcohol?  It really can't hurt.  I mean, as long as you're not doing anything related to the butt.  I mean, because...  Let me ask you, is...  You should never be drunk or high.  That's a really bad idea.  Never be drunk or high for the butt. 
[03:28:00]  That's the only way I can take it.  Is tush sex bad for you?  Like, for instance, I used to...  That's another myth.  Shut up.  Yeah, because people think, well, you know, that doesn't seem like it ought to happen.  Because in our culture, it seems so bad.  Yeah.  And they think, well, what if I get all stretched out of shape and I'm in pain?  Yeah.  Right.  If you're done properly with lots of lube and going very slowly...  Right.  Yeah.  It's just another muscle.  You're exercising.  But if she's crying and saying no...  Yeah, then you probably better quit.  Right. 
[03:28:30]  Right then.  Really?  Should you stop or should you put the diaper back on?  Absolutely.  I know.  He's being silly.  Yeah.  Oh, Connor.  I'm...  Sarah.  Sarah?  No, Shannon.  Oh, Shannon.  OP.  Safina is the company and Shannon is the team.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I've been calling you up.  Amber was the mistress.  Let's see.  The male G spot equals the P spot.  Yeah.  P dash.  P dash spot. 
[03:29:00]  What does that mean?  The P spot is pretty interesting because like I was saying, the clitoris and the penis are the same.  Well, men have a G spot too, of course, because we have all the same stuff.  It just moves around.  So, you know, where the G spot is right behind the pubic bone and you make this come-hither motion.  The P spot is just a little further back and it's on the backside of the prostate.  So, you're saying that men and women are pretty much the same before we were born, but it's just some type of a chromosome thing?  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:29:30]  And so, everything just shifts around.  But what makes women a little bit smarter than we are?  Oh, Connor, they sure are.  They sure are.  We know who the boss at home is unless you have a motor and a boat.  Then we teach you.  Wow.  Yeah, one little blonde hair in the front seat.  Dad didn't think.  Okay.  I do have a theory about happiness.  I'd love to try out on you.  Oh, oh.  Well, hold on.  A little experiment. 
[03:30:00]  Just if you agree.  Well, hold on.  Okay.  Here's my theory.  All right.  The reason why I focus on women with Safina and getting them to buy sex toys is because  I think that if women think something's a good idea and so, so, so, then we can all do it.  Yeah.  So that if women are having fun, then we can all have fun.  Right.  So my theory is that women are in control of the fun and that women can all have fun.  Yeah.  What do you think?  I have to agree with you. 
[03:30:30]  I think you're right.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You seem to have culled a lot of knowledge from a lot of people and put it together very  nicely in this book.  Well, thanks.  What have you learned on your own through your own sexual experiences?  Wow.  A lot.  I think I've learned a lot.  Well, I found the kazoo is really distracting.  What's that?  The kazoo is really distracting.  Jews are distracting? 
[03:31:00]  Is that the kazoo?  Kazoo.  What are you talking about?  Oh.  Something must be bleeding through.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, okay.  I was hearing this Christmas music.  We were having Christmas music.  No.  Actually, we don't play Christmas music on our show.  Never.  Yeah, because we figure all the other radio stations are doing that.  So I don't know what that was.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  Okay.  I don't know what that was.  We had some equipment problems earlier and we do apologize for that.  Oh, that's okay.  Oh, I'm Shannon.  If something was bleeding through from a production facility.  And I'm going to sneak this up your ass. 
[03:31:30]  But I flew from there.  I found my G-spot and I lost it and I found it again.  You did?  Yeah, I lost it for like seven years.  Wow.  Where'd you lose it?  You lost your G-spot?  Yeah, I actually thought it was attached to this guy I was dating.  And when we broke up, I thought, wow, that was so great.  I really...  For seven years?  Yeah.  Now nobody else was able to find it.  Seven years.  It was horrible.  G-spot doesn't work.  It was like breaking a mirror and then having bad luck, you know? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  So I found my G-spot because I finally found another guy who could find it.  And then I realized it wasn't attached to him.  Where was it?  Was it at the mall?  Oh, girl.  It was under the couch cushion.  Oh, Connor.  Oh, my.  She's buried.  Jiminy Cricket.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, listeners have a few questions, I think, right?  Great.  Yeah, they're very excited to talk to a... 
[03:32:30]  Sexpert.  A sexpert, right.  Do you call yourself a sexpert?  What is your title?  I'm a sexpert now.  I'm actually the new sexpert for iVillage.  Oh.  So I'm being a real sexpert now.  All right.  What is iVillage?  iVillage is a women's website.  It's, you know, it's like a kind of compilation of magazine articles from Cosmo and all the  major magazines and health issues and sex.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Let's go to Ken and...  VecchieHeads.com.  Hold on a minute.  Let's go to Ken in Virginia. 
[03:33:00]  Come on.  Stop it or you will not get your snorkel and flippers for Christmas.  Ken?  Yes, sir.  Do you have a question for the sexpert?  Absolutely.  A couple of months ago, little Connor was looking at a whore's ass and he came down  with a cold afterwards and I was wondering if she found anything in her research that  correlates the two.  Oh, yeah.  That is true.  Connor...  I was performing Tushalingus.  Yeah.  Tushalingus and got a cold?  And he got a cold.  I had a cold.  This is a true story, yes.  Is that possible, Shannon?  That's more than possible, but I don't know if it's related. 
[03:33:30]  Okay.  Huh.  But if you only got a cold, you're lucky.  Well, you can't get anything from that.  It can't happen to me.  Tushalingus.  Right?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  We're all having a good night.  Oh, gosh.  What can you get from Tushalingus?  Herpes is transmittable.  No, it's not.  It's from mouth to butt or anywhere.  Is he eating logs bad? 
[03:34:00]  I think you get something called stinkiest tongue-iest.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You don't get stink.  Oh, shit.  But a cold.  You got off easy.  You could have gotten something bad.  All right.  Why don't we say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, you got a question?  Hi.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Morning, Chris.  Welcome to the program.  Thanks.  Hi, Shannon.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, I just want to let you know that my wife has read a couple of books by Ms. Frankel.  She's a huge fan.  She's great, isn't she?  Yeah, yeah.  And I have a question for you. 
[03:34:30]  You were talking about these accessories.  And a friend suggested something I wanted to know.  My wife's teetering.  Maybe I could push her over the edge.  How do you feel about, I'd like her to defecate on a plate, preferably.  On a plate?  Yeah, and then, you know, maybe she could microwave it and when it gets nice and hot, run around the house with it yelling donkey sausage.  Have you heard of this before, this donkey sausage phenomenon? 
[03:35:00]  No, what's that?  Oh, well, it's this new thing and it's really great.  You just run around with a plate full of, you know, hot steaming defecation, running around yelling donkey sausage, donkey sausage, you know.  And it's supposedly a great turn on, but my wife hasn't, you know, she's kind of on the edge.  She doesn't want to try it.  Well, that's a good question.  Shannon, donkey sausage, yay or nay?  Well, you have to think of, to get anyone to do anything, especially with sex, you have to think what's in it for them.  Right.  So now why is that going to be fun for her? 
[03:35:30]  You have to figure something out.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  I think you have to come up with a reason why that's going to be fun.  Right.  For her.  Well, that's a great question.  I think it's some type of fetish thing he was into.  Yeah, like if he wants to put down plastic bags on the floor and maybe have someone come over this afternoon at 530 and, you know, drop logs on them.  Drop a few logs, right.  For 350.  All right, let's go to Eric in Manhattan.  Eric, you have a question?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Quite often I have sex with my wife in a balloon nut. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah?  And when I pull out, I have a little surprise.  Is that safe and how do I clean that?  I think what he's saying is he pulled his, does it say it right?  It's tush sex.  And he pulled it out and it looked like his mule was wearing an Abe Lincoln hat.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, gravy legs.  Right.  Well, one thing's for sure.  It feels like she's got to go to the bathroom.  She does.  And so she ought to consider that before you start because that's, you know, it's really not a holding area.  Right, right.  It's not a holding area. 
[03:36:30]  No.  So there really should be almost nothing in there.  Yeah.  Under normal conditions.  So you should probably ask that in advance.  Well, that's some good advice, I must say.  Good question.  Serious questions only from our listeners.  Yeah, who's this now?  Vivid Empire.  Hey, what's up?  Hi.  I want to know if this is considered a glass coffee table book.  And what is the best way to introduce scat to the woman?  Is this considered a coffee table book? 
[03:37:00]  No, a glass coffee table book.  A glass coffee table book.  You can lay under it and read it.  Right.  While listening to it.  Yeah, it's not big enough.  Chuck Berry Records.  It's not one of the big books, so I don't know.  But it does have like a really cheerful chiclet-looking cover.  Right.  So you can read it on the subway and nobody's going to think anything.  And what was the second part of your question?  What's the best way to introduce scat to my wife?  Scat.  Like the old singing?  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  I don't know.  My chest is an old gravy chest.  Old gravy chest.  Oh, um, you know, having the girl, like, release herself number two on the chest.  What?  Oh, is that what that is?  Is that what scat is?  Yeah, I think so.  The euphemisms are amazing, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  We're trying to keep it clean for broadcast.  Um, dude, is that what scat is, when someone uses your chest as a bowl?  Yeah, so you could even sculpt it, too. 
[03:38:00]  Huh.  Sharon?  Yeah.  I can't, like, I default back to the, why is it going to be fun for her?  Because that's the only way to motivate anyone to do anything.  Well, maybe it's fun for her, because the guy gets so turned on by his fetish.  And she knows that she won't go to bed with a blackened jaw.  Well, that's probably with a blackened jaw, right?  That's always an incentive.  Yeah, really.  I know, really, Connor.  If she's having a good time, I mean, if she really thinks that's going to be fun for you,  maybe she could be convinced. 
[03:38:30]  But that's going to be a long shot.  You probably should find somebody who has the same interest.  Right, right, right, right.  All right, we only have time for a few more questions here.  Let's say hi to, it looks like, Andre.  Andre?  Hello, everyone.  How are you today?  Hello, Andre.  Thank you for calling the program.  Thank you.  Thank you, Care Bear.  Shannon, are you there?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  I have a question for you.  I'm currently dating another man's girlfriend.  I'm playing a bit of a devil myself, if you understand.  But my question is that when, this gentleman, his name is Mark, when I have his girlfriend 
[03:39:00]  over and she is performing, how I say.  Oral treats?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good way.  Oral treats on me.  She tends to have a bit of a gag reflex very quickly.  And I want to know how to kind of maybe work her out of that so I can perhaps push a little  more down if you understand what I mean.  You understand what I'm saying to you?  Right.  Yeah, how do you get the girls to open their throats?  Yeah, because this one, she seems to not be able to take as much as I want to give her 
[03:39:30]  a cunt.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Well, maybe she's just not going to be able to.  It sounds like she's already trying too hard or she shouldn't be gagging.  She should probably use her hand at the same time.  She does use her hand a little bit, but I try to push more and not more than two or three  inches going in.  And then she tends to have a tough time with that cunt.  But I don't understand how I can maybe get her to be able to accept more without kind  of, you know, having a gag reflex or what do you think? 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's too much.  It's too much.  Maybe it's just too much.  But there's nothing I can do to try to help her get past that?  So she has to, she can use her hand at the same time.  But obviously it's going too far.  She wouldn't be gagging because gagging happens pretty far back.  Yeah.  There's too small amount.  Yeah.  Honre?  Is that it, Honre?  Honre.  Honre.  Honre.  He punched out.  Or his phone might have gone out.  I sound like a cellular.  All right.  Well, that was very good. 
[03:40:30]  Good question.  Good answer.  We got a couple of more?  Yeah.  Let's go to Scott in California.  Scott in Modesto.  Modesto.  Scott?  Yes.  Hi, little Connor.  Hi.  Hey there.  I had a question for Shannon.  I got in a little bit of legal trouble, Shannon, because my wife really wouldn't shut the  hell up.  And Connor, you were there.  You remember that, right?  I do.  Yeah.  It was a really, she was a pain in my ass.  And see, Shannon, I'm surrounded only by guys now because of my little legal trouble 
[03:41:00]  and because Amber's gone and my wife is well not with us.  So I was just wondering, now that I'm surrounded by guys, how should I go about satisfying my  desires?  Surrounded by guys?  You're in prison?  Yeah, he's in prison.  Oh, okay.  He calls our program a lot.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm trying to picture this.  I know.  He's been in for about a year now.  And a lot of the things that he enjoyed doing, fishing, things like that, he's not able to  do anymore.  So I guess he wants to enjoy himself. 
[03:41:30]  Is it normal to go gay because you're in prison, I guess, is what he wants to know.  Well, you know, the spectrum of kind of straight to gay is this continuum.  And through history, men tended to be kind of gay before they got married.  Really?  Yeah.  And if you look at ancient Greece and lots of parts of the world, even now, it's considered  like a normal boy's activity that you have from.  So it's not gay if you're single?  Yeah.  I think the definition of gay and straight is all what you decide to call yourself. 
[03:42:00]  Well, it's not gay if you don't push back.  Whatever makes you feel like, oh, that's okay.  I don't know if it's, like, whatever you call yourself.  But I mean, there are labels, I think, that make some kind of sense, right?  Yeah, there are.  I mean, people who are not interested in having sex with the opposite sex ever, that's on  the far end of gay.  Right.  But most people are somewhere in the middle.  Somewhere in the middle.  So Freddie Krueger, Rob Halford. 
[03:42:30]  You could go out with girls, but then, on the other hand, you're equally as comfortable  maybe putting a java log in the fireplace and having a glass of wine with another man in  your pajamas.  Let's relax.  Perhaps.  And that's absolutely acceptable.  Well, you know, I think if we didn't have social taboos around being gay, more people  would be more fluid about it.  I agree.  Right, right.  I agree.  But do you think that's a bit faggoty, the scenario that Anthony just described? 
[03:43:00]  Two men just hanging out, watching TV with a fire going in their pajamas, maybe.  Glass of wine.  Some cheese and crackers.  Cheese and crackers.  That sounds like a nice kind of almost...  That's a date.  It's a date, right?  Yeah.  That's a real date.  That's what we were thinking.  That kind of sounds like a date.  Yep.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden the firemen show up.  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's fabulous.  That's not the porn film.  It's fabulous.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we go on to the next question?  It's Bill in New Hampshire.  Bill, you have a question for the sexpert. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, Shannon?  I sure do.  Hey, O&A.  Nice.  Hey, Shibba Nuts.  Hi.  All right.  Bill, what do you have for Shannon?  Well, something I've been feeling really weird about for a long time.  When I was young, I used to kind of experiment with my friends.  Um, we'd hide under a porch and play silly games.  The whole circle jerk thing?  What do you mean?  What do you mean silly games?  Um, well, we'd get under the porch and, you know, we'd kind of gobble each other up a little bit. 
[03:44:00]  I'd rest my head on my friend's thigh and we'd just go from there.  What?  Do you have any weird name for this, uh, thing?  It sounds like a circle jerk with oral sex.  Oh.  Well, we called it Monster Rain.  Monster Rain?  Monster Rain?  What kind of a sick idiot would come up with a name like that?  What is that?  Why Monster Rain?  What does the rain have to do with it?  Helen, what do you think of that? 
[03:44:30]  Well, it was a good excuse to get under the porch.  We would pretend it was raining monsters.  Oh.  Oh, so the rain was coming.  You guys would hide under the porch and then, uh...  Right.  ...and, uh, give each other oral favors?  Exactly.  Oh, okay.  Uh, so, uh, you know, it's, Shannon, it's, uh, it's little kids blowing each other.  Yeah.  Where do you stand on that?  Helen, is that normal?  It seems like I think, yeah, it seems perfectly normal.  I think Monster Rain's pretty creative, but...  Yeah, there, ooh, there you go.  Pretty creative.  I feel a lot better about myself.  Yeah, I mean, how old are you, um, when that, when that, like, when you and Jimmy Robinson 
[03:45:00]  don't do that anymore, Helen?  How old are you?  How old am I or how old was I?  No, no, no, no.  I'm asking the sex part.  How old is that when you're not normal anymore for doing that?  Well, I don't know if you're ever not normal for it.  I mean, because then you just become gay.  Well, the Bible says different.  Huh?  At some point, you just cross over into gay.  All right.  Right, right.  Once you've hit puberty and, you know, then you're just seeing guys instead of girls under  the porch.  Yeah, yeah.  No, that...  Yeah, but it's just, that seems like a normal kid thing.  Yeah, Bill, don't worry about it. 
[03:45:30]  Thank you for the young question.  Yeah, that's, uh...  Thanks, Bill.  I like that one, actually.  Let's, uh, let's go to New Mexico and talk to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Uh, not a whole lot.  How's it going on, eh?  Good.  We're enjoying, um, Shannon.  Shannon Muller?  Mullin.  Mullin.  Mullin.  I'm sorry.  Clap in there, sweetie pie.  Hello, marmalade bag.  Oh, yeah.  Shannon, I got a question for you.  Great.  Shannon.  Yep.  Oh, something must have, uh, happened to his phone.  Uh-oh. 
[03:46:00]  Did we lose, uh, New Mexico?  Yeah, okay.  Aw.  I don't know what that was.  Aw.  Uh, sorry, Shannon.  Let's go to...  And he had asked, like, Shannon, like it was going to be a good question or something.  Yeah.  And we lost him.  It could have been a good one.  Now we're all going to be wondering what, uh, he was going to say, which is, uh, always  uncomfortable.  Uh, Wool Jimmy is, uh, calling from New York.  Yes, Wool Jimmy.  Hey, Opie Anthony.  Uh, little Connor.  How's it going?  I've been better.  I'm kind of wet behind the ears.  Oh, that's terrible.  Well, let's give you a little background information.  I'm a 35-year-old aspiring comedian, and, uh, I enjoy Ladies of the Night, occasionally. 
[03:46:30]  Really?  And the problem is...  Uh, you know, you're, um, you're an aspiring comedian.  Can we see you, um, anywhere?  Uh, actually, you can see me at the downtown on December 23rd.  That would be, what, this Thursday night, huh?  That would be.  Okay, all right.  Go to my website, eatabullet.com, if you'd like to see my luscious body.  Are you going to hopefully be funny?  Oh, I will kill.  I'm ready to go.  Or is it going to be the same old crap that, uh, you're known for?  Oh, why do you got to do this to me on radio? 
[03:47:00]  Sean, I'm just joking.  We kind of know this guy.  He's a local comedian, and he's a meaty disaster.  Connor, you have something to add to Jimmy?  Yeah, a little, if you want to go see a little Jimmy, you can see him and, uh, actually,  uh, Nathaniel, who's headlining, at 516-293-7700.  That's the downtown.  A little plug for you, a little Jimmy.  Thanks a lot.  Wow.  I'm going to come to you in, actually.  All right.  Shannon, if you'd like to come, too, it's on me.  Cool.  Yeah, that sounds like fun.  Well, my problem here is that, uh, I enjoy my ladies' night, like usual, and, um, I have  a hard habit of laying on my back and having them urinate on my throat. 
[03:47:30]  Mm-hmm.  Um, I need to get over this habit because I'm running out of money.  My mother's getting very distraught over this situation.  You told your mother about that?  My mother actually left a message on my answer.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  Okay, yeah.  Uh, Shannon, we do have that phone call.  Oh, no, please don't.  We do have that phone call, but, uh, Shannon, we'd love to play this.  It's a message that, uh, Lil' Jimmy's, uh, mother left Lil' Jimmy on his phone.  Mm-hmm.  And it's about, uh, ladies of the evening and maybe what Jimmy could do to, uh, I don't 
[03:48:00]  know, stop, stop seeing them so much.  How interesting.  Let's hear it.  Yeah, maybe you can, uh, ask some insight.  Yeah, I mean, you're the sexpert.  I mean, you know, what is, what does Lil' Jimmy Norton's mom know about prostitutes, right?  My face is red.  Let's give a, all right, hold on, Lil' Jimmy.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's Mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here, but we heard the radio  show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, um, which is 
[03:48:30]  a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something, so I was thinking, you know, you  have that nice gym downstairs, and, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour,  and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise, and, uh, you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up, and you relieve, you know, tension and stuff, and you'd be meeting other  people. 
[03:49:00]  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling, so, uh, don't get offended or think I'm strange, but I am  a mother, and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything's falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help, it would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere, because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But anyway, uh, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas. 
[03:49:30]  I really hope you can make it.  And, uh, anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  And there it is, little Jimmy's mom.  Isn't that sweet?  Uh, little Jimmy, thank you.  Thank you for, uh, you know, sending that in and sharing with everybody.  We greatly appreciate that.  But, uh, but Shannon, what we were thinking is that what was little Jimmy's mom saying  because of the fact she was saying Dr. Phil says to replace things, and that he should  go to the gym, is that basically he's kind of fat-breasted and awful, and that picking 
[03:50:00]  a prostitute is probably the only option until he does a few crunches.  Well, she said that really nicely, if that's what she's saying.  Actually, I'd like to play right now the, uh, a phone call that, uh, our own Connor's  mother, uh, made to, uh, Connor.  Oh, yeah.  On the show.  So, hi, uh, Connor, it's mom.  Next stop, Davey Jones Locker. 
[03:50:30]  Um.  Uh.  Hello?  Is that it?  Yeah, I don't even know what that means.  Yeah.  I didn't get that.  I didn't get it at all.  It's an old Cecilia message.  They got diapers.  I don't get that either, so.  Um, well, any advice to little Jimmy as far as the hooker habit and the mom calling and 
[03:51:00]  all that?  He kind of sleeps with the guppies.  Well, exercise is always a good idea, but it's not exactly equivalent to a urination  set.  Right.  Exactly.  So probably that won't change what you feel like doing, but it's always good to get fit.  Okay.  Uh, does that help you, little Jimmy?  That really helps a lot, actually.  I don't feel so bad about myself.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you for calling the program.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  We're going to go to downtown.  Bye, little Jimmy.  See you at the downtown.  Yep.  Thursday night.  We'll get to see him again.  That's going to be great.  It's going to be a great show. 
[03:51:30]  Hey, Greg in Vegas.  We've got to wrap up with, um, uh.  Shannon.  Shannon.  Hey, I've got a question about pussy farts.  Do I cry?  Do I laugh?  Do I hang a car freshener over it?  What do I do?  What was the first part?  Uh, pussy farts.  Shannon, where do you stand on that?  Pussy farts.  Well, they're there, you know.  But should girls feel silly, uncomfortable, so they just say, ah, ah, here it is, okay.  Moving around.  And if the guy wasn't there, it wouldn't be making noise, you know?  Right, right.  Good point.  Because it was really the guy's fault for moving around. 
[03:52:00]  Ah.  So, no.  So, how, so your book now, how, when did it actually come out?  It just came out at the end of November.  So, it's been out for two, three weeks.  Oh, two, three weeks.  Two or three weeks.  So, we must have one of the, uh, first copies.  We have one of the first copies.  Oh, thank you.  Connor's loving it.  I think they sent you, like, early.  Why'd you only send one, though?  Uh, I don't know.  The publisher did.  I'm sure we can get you more.  Please do.  Oh, yeah.  I'm running out of pages. 
[03:52:30]  Connor's going through it like crazy.  I'll get them to send you a couple more.  Thanks so much.  He loves it, yeah.  All right.  I don't know what this question is, so we'll, uh.  Ripping right through it.  We'll try to figure this out together on the air.  Zach from Tampa.  Zach.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, sweet bitch.  Hi, Angel Face.  Like, two callers ago, I love the ladies of the evening.  And I picked up one recently.  And as I was rubbing my hands over her back, I noticed it was kind of wide.  And then I found some balls.  So, does Shannon have any suggestion for me on this? 
[03:53:00]  Wow.  Maybe you should talk to him a little bit more before you get them home.  Oh, good, good.  Good suggestion.  Yeah.  Well, Shanae, should you feel ashamed that you picked up a man when you thought you were  picking up a female prostitute?  No, no, I wouldn't.  And what's the best way, you say, to, like, wash man breath off of your junk, just in case,  you know, something happened.  And then you're getting this waft of man breath coming up.  Yeah, and your friend Tyler is knocking on the bathroom door going, how was it?  And you're, you know, you're in there washing shame off your mule. 
[03:53:30]  And it's that thick, uh, soap.  Yeah, that's a little much.  All right.  All right, I guess so.  Well, we've learned a lot here today.  Shannon, thank you.  Thanks so much.  The name of the book is The Best Years of Your Life.  No, The Best You'll Ever Have.  Best You'll Ever Have.  And you can get it in, um, I can't see that page.  Yes, Jimmy?  Yeah, where can you get it?  Connor?  Barnes & Noble, Amazon, any major bookstore.  Now, this is, uh, your first book? 
[03:54:00]  This is my first.  Oh, wow.  Congratulations.  Thanks.  It's got to be very exciting.  It is exciting.  I hope people buy it and read it so I can write another one.  It's a real page turner.  Yeah.  All right.  Um, yeah.  This was really good.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  Thanks very much.  Um, I'm going to have a book party.  So if you're in New York, you're welcome to come.  Hold on one second.  What?  Another question?  Where's the book party, Shannon?  Yeah, where's the book party going to be held? 
[03:54:30]  The book party's going to be at Lotus.  What happened?  Yeah, but she got it out.  I know.  You weren't able to hang up on her quick enough with these computer phones.  I thought she was going to give me an um or something.  Um, click.  I know you let her get all the information out.  Ah, I blew it.  It's all right.  She got cut off.  She's standing there talking into the phone.  Oh, hold on.  Something happened to her phone.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What happened?  What happened?  Shannon?  I, yeah.  I just got disconnected.  Wait, what happened? 
[03:55:00]  So, uh, the, wait.  The book party's going to be, um.  At Lotus.  Hello?  Shannon.  Jesus.  Is she going to call back?  If she does.  Silent game.  All right.  Silent game.  Let's see.  Uh, Bernie Getz is going to be on the show tomorrow.  Are you kidding me?  I've been begging.  How great is that?  I want Bernie Getz.  Bernie Getz will be on the program tomorrow.  Well, he's, I think, he might be coming in or calling in.  We don't know.  Well.  All right.  Very good.  Coming in.  Great.  I love, I know.  Make sure Earl is here tomorrow.  Huh?  All right. 
[03:55:30]  Oh.  Shannon.  I don't know what's going on.  Sorry about that.  So, your book party is coming.  Do you want to just, um, any final thoughts on the book?  Um, well, it's great for Christmas, so don't hesitate to get one at the holidays, but mainly  I'm interested in people telling stories, so if you, if you do pick up a copy of the  book, I hope you'll email me, and my email's in the book.
