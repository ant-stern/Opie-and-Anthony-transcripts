<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Anthony unveiling a new haircut, ending a seven-year cap-wearing streak.  This prompted considerable teasing from Opie and Rick, who compared his new 'do to various celebrities (David Cassidy, Ricky Martin, David Hasselhoff, and a Cocker Spaniel), and commented on the $130 price tag.  The discussion meandered through Rick's hair products, a failed Ben Stein interview attempt, and plans to post photos of Anthony's hair on the website.  Listeners called in to offer their opinions on the new look.

The show then shifted to a review of Friday's "55-gallon drum challenge," using photos and audio clips.  The hosts and callers critiqued the embarrassing weekend WNEW programming, particularly a sweeper using poor quality music and announcing the show as "Powered by Opie and Anthony."  They heavily criticized the weekend DJs' playlist choices (mentioning Billy Squier) and suggested airing "best of" weekday segments.

Next came a discussion of the destruction of numerous Bruce Springsteen CDs, a reaction to Springsteen's song "American Skin (41 Shots)."  The hosts debated their criticism of Springsteen and their right to respond to his music.  The show concluded with a bizarre story about a woman found in the hosts' office, apparently invited by a coworker, Earl, leading to accusations against Earl for unauthorized access, and a heated exchange about his possession of a master key.

A later segment focused intensely on Earl's unauthorized presence in the hosts' office with a woman.  Earl's explanations were challenged, revealing his access to a master key through the chief engineer, and culminating in a heated discussion, with potential implications of Earl leaving the show.  This transitioned back to a recap of the "55-gallon drum challenge," with calls from participants and Tabitha's husband, John, who expressed extreme anger over his wife's treatment. John detailed the substances (including unspecified disgusting materials) and Tabitha's distress, including nightmares and excessive showering. Wendy, another participant, also called, describing her allergic reactions and lingering bad smells.  Captain Anthony, a caller, recounted witnessing John's intense negative reactions.  Photos and videos of the event were mentioned as being available online.  The hosts also made tasteless jokes about Don Imus's horse-riding accident (five broken ribs, a collapsed lung, a broken collarbone, and a separated shoulder), and the Imus/Curtis Schwealer ratings battle.  Steve from foundrymusic.com was in the studio during this segment.

Another segment featured Wendy recounting her "55-gallon drum challenge" experience, including the smell, bugs, and overall unpleasantness,  with plans for an even "sicker" sequel.  The discussion then moved to disruptive moviegoers, particularly at a *Shaft* showing, with callers sharing anecdotes often involving racially charged humor.  This segued into discussions of an Anna Kournikova bra ad, a cow art installation in Manhattan, and criticisms of *Me, Myself & Irene*.  Audio clips of Wendy during the challenge, a call with "Da-da-Dave" (their old program director), and a discussion of AAVE were included.  Psycho Mark and other remote team members called in from a sticker distribution event in Washington Square Park.

A final segment focused on the aftermath of the "55-gallon drum challenge," featuring calls from Kate, Jane, and Christy, describing the smells and discomfort.  Wendy's screams were highlighted.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com mentioned online video footage.  The hosts discussed the lingering smell, requiring a body deodorizer.  A significant portion involved a furious rant against radio DJ Vince Skelson, with Opie throwing CDs, a box set, and nearly a magic eight ball, accidentally injuring Ben.  The rant used vulgar language and insults.  Wrestling videos were given away to callers, and the show ended with well-wishes for Imus.  Gary, the "Bug Guy" who supplied the insects, also called in.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Powered by Opie and Anthony, owned by Infinity Broadcasting, this is 1027 WNEW, New York.  212-757-1027 is our phone number. It's the O&H Show.  Hello. How are you, Anthony?  Very good. How are you, Opie? Anthony sporting a new hairdo.  Wow, let me see. Cool, five seconds into the live portion of our broadcast. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, you're shocked the hell there, everyone.  Anthony's been wearing a baseball cap for seven straight years.  Yeah, seven, uh, just about.  Not that I notice or anything, but I sit across from you every damn day, so, you know, you pick up on things like that.  It's been quite some time with the hair pulled back into the ponytail and the baseball cap.  Very easy. I guess you could prove to everyone that you're not bald.  A lot of people thought you were wearing the, you know, the baseball hat for all those years because you had a chrome dome. 
[00:01:00]  Well, with more and more, uh, pictures that have been on the websites, uh, we were getting more and more instant feedback and emails from people going,  Anthony, uh, what's with the hat? I bet you have a chrome dome, you bald bastard.  And once again, these, uh, questions coming from the male listeners.  Yeah, yeah.  For some reason.  Very concerned with, uh, Opie, uh, mine and Opie's appearance for some reason.  Yeah, once again.  Very involved with how we look.  So, uh, I don't know, that and, uh, just the fact that, yeah, it's been quite a few years with the cap and, 
[00:01:30]  and it was kind of hard to go anywhere where I had to get dressed nice.  So, uh, yeah, went, had it, uh, lopped off.  Now, this is the first time you had a haircut in how many years?  Uh, put it this way.  Last time I had a haircut, um, we had not yet been to the moon.  I do believe.  Uh, you guys are all funny, I understand.  I didn't say nothing.  No, Rick, I mean, Rick and Psycho Mark and stuff. 
[00:02:00]  Rick, for some reason, really having a pisser of a time with it.  What song do you want to play, Rick?  Is that...  She loves you, yeah.  Really?  It's not straight like a...  It's not a Beatles do.  I would understand.  See, I don't get your joke, Rick.  I would understand if you come across something that's kind of, like, topical as far as the haircut goes.  He doesn't have a Beatles haircut.  It's definitely not.  My hair's curly.  All right, Hasselhoff.  Hasselhoff.  That's not... 
[00:02:30]  Mr. Ricky Martin, dude, talking.  Come on, man.  Give me a break.  Hasselhoff.  Wow, okay.  I'm silly, Opie.  Ooh, look at me.  I got a haircut.  Wow, what an outrageous guy Anthony is.  Ooh, what a kook I am.  What a...  Just a nut job, Rick, huh?  That I took the hat off and got a haircut.  Ooh, I'm out of control.  You are.  What's next?  When does the Jerry Curl commercial start?  Jerry Curl?  My hair's completely dry.  It's...  I don't... 
[00:03:00]  Sure.  I don't get it.  First of all, Mr. Hair Care product in your hair...  Whose hair has more crap in it in this room right now?  Rick.  What are you talking about?  Look how much crap you got in your hair.  You got mousse up the yim-yam in your hair.  And the blonde tint.  The highlights.  At least I'm in the right decade.  What?  Cassidy.  Cassidy?  I don't get it.  It's like David Cassidy with that haircut.  David Cassidy. 
[00:03:30]  Is it that like...  Do I have a shag haircut?  David Cassidy has straight hair.  You're...  Straight hair again.  Jesus.  What did that cream come out of?  A man's pump dispenser on your head, Rick?  What is that?  Protein mousse?  This is Anthony's attempt to deflect.  No attempt to deflect.  I had a big poof ball on my head.  I went and got it cut off.  The point I was just trying to make is, I've known you for seven years, and I know the answer 
[00:04:00]  to the question.  The last time you had a haircut was about seven years ago.  Closer to ten.  Right.  Nine years ago.  Right.  You haven't gone to a haircutting place in seven to ten years.  No.  Not at all.  But it was about time.  It's funny that Rick's abusing you with the highlights he's got in his hair.  I know.  What now?  Show me.  Let it all out.  Let's go.  Rick's...  Well, Mark's talking about how Anthony looks like a Cocker Spaniel. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, he...  That's pretty funny.  And I was wondering if Anthony had any kennel cough.  Very funny.  No, Mark, that was good.  I'd give Mark that one.  Cocker Spaniel.  I have curly hair.  What am I supposed to do?  Get it straightened?  It's...  It's...  It's...  Curly.  It's loose curly.  The point I want to make, which is pretty funny, like, Ann hasn't been to a haircutter in  seven to ten years.  Yeah.  How much did your new due cost? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, it was very expensive.  Come on, just saying.  Very expensive.  You can just take your abuse, and we'll move on with the show today.  Opie, after ten years, if you average out the price, it comes down to very cheap per  year.  Per year.  I've probably spent less in the past ten years on haircuts than...  Certainly than you.  Sure.  Or Rick has.  Sure.  Opie, it was $130 on my hair.  Well, I had to go to the place that a Gwyneth goes, and everybody else. 
[00:05:30]  Is that the truth?  You went to a place where a bunch of celebrities go to their haircuts?  Ben knows this place.  Ben.  Top on the mic.  Ben knows all this crap for some reason.  Did you get a nut shaving while you're in there, too?  Well, but...  No, no, I didn't.  Ben.  You know the place where Ant got his hair cut?  Yeah, it's right on Madison.  All right.  And who goes there?  Gwyneth.  What's her name that's married to John Stamos?  Steven Tyler.  Steven Tyler.  Sure.  Madonna.  Yeah.  What's the name of the place? 
[00:06:00]  John Sahag.  Yeah.  John Sahag.  The beautiful people.  That's where I went.  Where the beautiful people go.  Yes.  Well, let me tell you something.  After the years of abuse and being under a hat and in a hair tie for many years, I didn't  just want to go to the barber shop where they take the comb and the blue fluid and comb  it out and, you know.  They gave you a nice robe and a little massage while they're...  No, no massage.  A little...  While they shampoo your hair. 
[00:06:30]  They do.  I knew it had to be good.  Wall-to-wall thing.  Some of these places...  Some of these places now, when they're shampooing you, they massage you almost to the big O.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, boy.  What is this now, Rick?  Very funny.  Yeah.  Okay.  The beautiful people.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, what was I supposed to do?  Wow.  I actually went somewhere that was good.  Ooh.  What an ass I am, Mopi. 
[00:07:00]  Boy, that Rick got me.  Hey, what a jerk-off I am, wanting to get a haircut.  Wow.  You're saying ass and jerk-off?  What?  Huh?  Oh.  Oh, Rick.  Oh, he did...  Go talk to Ben Stein again.  Yeah, really.  How's your interview with Ben Stein?  Oh, that's right.  We got you pulled off of that.  No, he still did it.  Did you?  You didn't?  Rumor has it you still interviewed Ben Stein.  Nope.  Didn't do it.  Oh, yes.  What is Rick doing hosting the Ben Stein interview on Comedy Central?  I want to ask Stein some questions at 8, but you have to, like, send in the questions ahead of time. 
[00:07:30]  But I started to listen to the real audio stream, and the first thing I hear is,  Hey, this is Rick from 1027 WNAW New York.  Why didn't Rick do something stupid?  Hmm.  It wasn't you?  No, that's, like, from two months ago.  Did Anthony go to the St. Regis after the haircut?  No.  What other socialite parties have I gone to?  None.  And, uh...  Oh, Rick, did I also buy a set of pots and pans for $700? 
[00:08:00]  That's an oldie but goodie.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  How you doing, Hope?  Uh, we're doing well.  Hey, did the hair look like Mike Brady when he got the perm?  No, no.  It's actually, uh...  It's actually parted.  It's a new look for Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, if you don't look like the greatest American he's ever, you're all right.  No, no.  He looks all right.  He looks all right.  It's working.  All right, Joe.  Put the pictures up on the site, bro.  Look, all the guys, very involved.  Want a picture? 
[00:08:30]  Get out of here.  When we take pictures up here, it'll end up like that.  I'm not going to put a picture up there so the likes of Rick can beat off to it when  they go home.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I was wondering if pictures were going to be up on the website.  Now, the paparazzi, they're waiting outside to get the first picture of Anthony without  his hat on.  Eventually, the new pictures will work their way onto the site.  And you'll go, oh, my God.  Ain't got a haircut.  Big deal.  Ain't got a haircut.  Big deal.  All right, man.  All right.  Later. 
[00:09:00]  Bye.  Just weird seeing you without that damn hat, yo.  Brian, what's up?  Brian.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, Anthony.  Oh, I'm fine.  Nice show on Friday, by the way.  Yes.  It was very nice.  I thought all the barrels should have been named Wendy just in Anthony's honor.  But, Anthony, I'm just curious.  When you go meet your girlfriend's parents and go to summer camp, did you want your hair  to look good when you're going to be away for the summer?  Well, now you're on to me.  That was it.  Yes.  All right. 
[00:09:30]  Absolutely.  Yes.  The girlfriend's parents.  Right.  Yeah.  To meet them.  All right, Brian.  So I can take them to summer camp.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's see.  Did the haircut look like...  309...  Wait a minute.  Let me do the math.  You're almost done.  About 11 minutes left.  Yeah, you got 11 minutes.  Okay.  Yeah.  When they pulled the hat off you before they cut your hair, did the haircutter just go,  holy S?  No, I didn't wear the hat to the place.  All right.  I washed my hair and then went without the hat.  You should have went in with that huge, like, afro.  Yeah, sure.  Walk in the door. 
[00:10:00]  Can you do something with this?  Can you do something with this, please?  No, the odd thing is, over the years, especially with having the hair pulled back into a ponytail  for so long, it wasn't curly anymore on top or on part of the side.  Right.  It straightened itself out over the course of the past, like, five years, I'd say.  Anything else?  I'm just reading the...  The Euler?  The Euler?  The Euler?  No, I'm not selling locks of hair on eBay. 
[00:10:30]  Did they pluck your eyebrows?  Okay, Marco checking in.  Did Anthony get his hair cut the same place I do?  Did you get your panty line waxed while you were at it?  $100 for a haircut.  I used Mujan.  Oh, my God.  Well, I knew this would happen.  Why would this show be any different than any other part of the third grade?  You walk in, get a haircut, and your classmates, your little classmates in the third grade make fun of you. 
[00:11:00]  You brought it upon yourself today, though.  You walked into the studio, and just the first words out of your mouth were, okay, let's hear it.  Let it roll.  Let's get it out in the open.  I got a new haircut.  Here it is.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, gentlemen.  Hey.  Unfortunately, I'm starting to lose faith in you guys.  First, the opening of your show, you go into Opie's girl show last week.  Now, we're spending about 40 minutes on Anthony's hair.  This is starting to sound like The View.  The View.  First of all, we spent eight minutes on Ant's hair. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Second of all, the only reason we went to Ant is to get the abuse off me and the stupid Jekyll and Hyde.  You guys fight like chicks, man.  It's great.  Yeah, that's what we do.  I'm not even fighting with Ant.  Ant's fighting with Rick, really.  I could care less if Anthony got a haircut.  Rick, very concerned about my hair.  Anthony, do you have any black blood in you?  Sicilian, so who knows?  Close enough.  Thank you, Paul.  Good luck.  All right.  All right, we're just about done here.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, Odie?  How are you?  I was one of the guys that came by for the 55-gallon drum. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, the 55-gallon drum.  Yeah, I was the guy who brought that nasty stuff with the Cheerios.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So anyway, I had my hair long for about two years.  And I finally cut it off because I had to go to court.  Yeah.  So, you know, of course, when they cut it off, I had a couple...  No, I had a couple tears coming down and everything, so...  But I know what it's like because all my friends would be in front of me, too.  No, I didn't care.  I wanted to get a cut.  What's the joke there, Rick? 
[00:12:30]  Thank you, Dave.  Oh, Fram, the guy...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's exactly what it's like.  Yeah, sure, Rick.  Rick, you know, it's hysterical.  Your hair looks closer to Ricky Martin's than anything you've pointed out looks like my hair.  That's right, and I'm a big fan.  I'm just saying.  Well, Fram, Rick's just...  First of all, it's not even a tenth as long as that.  I don't have bangs.  I'm amazed he's trying to take you on.  He's so... 
[00:13:00]  He's so ridiculous.  He's trying to get you back for the car stunt.  I was not even involved in that, but it's just funny.  I don't get it.  So you're saying now it looks like Frampton.  Frampton.  Off it comes alive.  Maybe before I got it cut.  When it was wet.  I don't know what you're...  Why is everybody else laughing at it when they see the picture?  I didn't laugh.  You guys laughed.  Oh, yes, you did.  I did not. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Just like...  Frampton's hair is a lot longer than what Ant's pointing right there.  It's even...  Very uncomfortable in the studio right now.  John, what's up?  Oh, yeah, it's just like that.  John.  Like, give me a break.  Good afternoon, John.  Holy smoke.  And put the hat on.  I was just wondering, do you think that Anthony might have worn his white shorts to get his  hair cut?  Yes, I did.  Now, that's funny.  Thank you, John.  See you.  That's the first funny phone call of the day right there. 
[00:14:00]  So.  I'd put the hat right back on when you leave the studio because, you know, our freaked out  listeners, they're going to be all outside trying to take a peek of your new do,  Anthony.  I don't care.  Fine by May.  All right.  Heath, what's going on, Heath?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Listen, I've had long hair for 15 years.  My wife has been bitching and complaining.  I got married about three years ago.  That's all she wants me to do is cut my frickin' hair off.  All right.  Well, it happens. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, it happens.  Come on.  I mean, everybody knows this one way or another.  And then what happens?  You know, you get your hair all chopped off.  I mean, my hair goes almost halfway down my back.  So why are you getting it cut then?  Just because your wife says so?  Well, my dad actually started with me first.  He's been bitching and complaining.  Why don't you grow up?  Why don't you cut your hair and be more respectable?  How do you want your hair?  I want it long.  Then keep it long and tell everyone to go F themselves.  Well, I do that, and then my wife says, well, what do you want your balls? 
[00:15:00]  I think my wife has them in her hands, the way she's been acting lately.  We just had a baby three weeks ago, and she's like, what are you going to do,  let your daughter braid your hair when she gets older?  And then my dad comes over and goes, yeah, what are you going to do,  let her braid your hair?  You should get your hair cut off.  You're the biggest pussy if you cut your hair if you want to keep it long.  You are.  So what are you saying about Anthony, then?  I guess, uh...  He wanted to cut his hair.  Yeah.  No one made him.  Oh, you wanted to cut your hair?  Yeah.  It was a mess.  There was nothing I could do with it but put a baseball cap on,  and it's kind of hard to go to all those beautiful people parties wearing the baseball cap 
[00:15:30]  with my expensive suits.  You're the one who does that, and Nopi's the one who goes to see Sebastian Bach, right?  Right, exactly.  Now you've got to figure it out.  There's a difference between getting your hair cut because your wife said so  and going to a play one night, one night only.  I did it because the ten years I was married,  my wife wanted me to cut my hair for ten years straight,  so I figured, screw you, now I'll cut it.  Okay, so I should wait another seven years before I decide to cut it. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  No, I cut my hair because I wanted to cut my hair.  All right.  Are we done with Ant's hair?  Are we going to talk about ponytails next for an hour?  Ponytail?  What's with a ponytail?  Bob on a car phone.  We've got to talk about the 55-gallon drum challenge from Friday.  Yeah.  And other things today.  We've got to talk about Imus falling off a damn horse.  And there's so much stuff to talk about in the news today, okay?  All day long, what we're going to do is just give you snippets of Friday's show 
[00:16:30]  because it was absolutely unbelievable.  A little quick clips, yeah.  We did the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We had five girls go into these huge barrels.  Mm-hmm.  They were locked in there for, what, they lasted three and a half hours?  Yeah.  We had two out of the five drop out late in the festivities.  And everyone is talking about this show.  Wherever I went this weekend, that's all anyone wanted to talk about.  Yeah, that's a lot of people.  We have clips from the show, actually pictures from the show on www.com.  There's 170 pictures up there. 
[00:17:00]  And also Steve from foundrymusic.com took a lot of the NAW clips  and just put some of the best ones up on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, you've got to check the pictures out.  The best pictures are the before and after pictures of all the girls.  Yeah.  They show them right before they got in the barrels, and they're all smiling and dry.  And then coming out, they just look horrified and wet and disgusting.  And you can see worms on them, various parts of their bodies.  Right.  Really sick.  So what we're going to do is throughout the day, we're just going to play some clips from Friday's show. 
[00:17:30]  They're really quick clips, a couple minutes tops each, okay?  I think this clip is early on in the competition when we finally started dumping stuff into the barrel, okay?  Yeah.  Let's pick it up right here.  This is debauchery mania.  Prostate exams for everyone.  11-1027-WNEW.  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I did this weekend?

It's Monday.  Hey, man.  Getting back into the swing of things here.  Got a Tommy on line, too.  Tommy, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  A little Tiger Woods getting into the WOW festivities in today's post today. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, the WOW on the front page of the post today.  Oh, yeah.  Talking about Tiger Woods, of course.  That performance yesterday was absolutely amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  Tiger setting records.  Tommy?  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh.  I thought I was talking to you by getting...  Hey, how was Poison last night, Opie?  Oh, great.  I was there, yeah.  Okay.  Anything else?  Yeah, that's it, guys.  All right.  It almost.  Yeah, that's good.  Come on, Eric. 
[00:20:30]  Jesus Christ.  Give me a break.  Tiger Woods looked awesome, and Chuck Knobloch can't throw again.  Oh, my God.  Look out.  Right.  Whoa.  We got audio of Chuck practicing his throw to first base.  Chuck, throw it to first.  Control.  Remember, control.  Okay.  What the hell is his problem?  Try it again.  Oh, my God.  He missed.  He hit the broadcast booth.  He hit the old lady, man.  Oh, he hit some broad right in the face.  Poor lady.  What?  Yeah, look at that. 
[00:21:00]  A big wow on the post.  Yeah, I know.  That's great.  That's the rocks.  Yeah.  You know what I thought was cool about Tiger Woods?  The announcers have just got to get a life.  He had a perfect round going on Saturday.  He gets to the 18th hole, and he, what?  He duck hooks it into the rocks.  Yeah.  So he goes, he starts cursing on live TV on NBC.  And they're like, you know, Tiger Woods, you know, he's a role model and stuff.  He shouldn't be cursing.  Oh, please. 
[00:21:30]  Shut up.  He's just doing what any other person would do in that situation.  You get pissed.  Curse your brains out.  Yeah, you get pissed.  Get out of here.  It's not like, what are you playing?  You're not playing in a bar.  You're playing shuffleboard or something.  What did he say anyway?  F and prick or something like that?  I like how his curses don't make any sense.  That's how I curse.  I got to get pissed at something.  I'm just like, ah, you S, F, C word.  When you get really pissed off, it doesn't matter if it makes sense.  You just string the curses together and hope it comes out. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Meaning something.  Just curse.  So that was going on.  Richard Bate talks about WOW and WABC.  Man, is he the biggest hypocrite in the world.  Heath, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, man.  I was with my father last night.  It was Father's Day.  And Richard Bate has this video show at night on WABC.  And he told me, he was talking about some lady who went up to the officers.  She was like, about that whole wilding thing, whatever.  Yeah, let me help you along here. 
[00:22:30]  Everyone's talking about the wilding thing from Central Park last week.  And so the cop was like, yeah, wow.  What?  I feel like a dick.  I feel like a dick.  See ya.  All right.  Okay, terrific.  If someone's got the story, we could talk about it.  That's pretty funny.  Instant feedback.  Chris from Union.  Hey, guys, I heard some Bruce Springsteen being played on NEW over the weekend.  I thought Bruce Springsteen baseball took care of that. 
[00:23:00]  What the hell's going on over there?  I don't know what the hell's going on around here on weekends.  Oh, my God.  Something is going on.  Something need be done here at WNEW.  We're getting the weekday order.  The weekday is in order.  You know, shaping up.  We're very happy with the way we're doing here on NEW.  But when you tune in on the weekends.  This radio station's a complete embarrassment on the weekends. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  I mean, my family and friends want to listen.  I go, don't listen to NEW on the weekends.  It's horrendous.  They're giving people shows that have no business doing radio.  None whatsoever.  It's an embarrassment.  You know that sweeper that they play, Powered by Opie and Anthony?  Oh, they were playing that during the weekend.  I know.  I heard that.  I'm like, please, don't put our names on on the weekend.  Because it's like two different animals here.  It is really embarrassing to hear this in your car. 
[00:24:00]  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 107 WNEW.  New York.  I mean, you got like a lame tune to go into after that?  I mean, you don't know what this station is on the weekend.  Is it a talk station?  Is it a classic rock station?  Is it college radio?  Oh, it's horrible.  Is it CB radio?  Is it shout-out radio?  It's horrendous.  We don't know what the hell it is. 
[00:24:30]  I'm telling the boss tomorrow not to run that idea on weekends anymore.  No, not during the weekends.  Because we don't want anything to do with the weekend programming here at NEW.  You don't want to be associated with it.  It's embarrassing.  I heard that.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  And it's like, oh, then they go into some lame-ass, old, moldy oldie after a front cell that's just like a car wreck.  Hey, Tom, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Hold on, let me put my radio down.  Yeah.  Yo, NEW kicks butt on weekends, man. 
[00:25:00]  What?  They play Squire.  They play Old Deflepid that nobody else plays.  You know, we grew up in the 80s, you know?  What Billy Squire song did you hear this weekend?  Stroke Me, Stroke Me.  What?  Emotion in motion.  Oh, yeah.  That makes for some great radio in the 80s.  Oh, that kicks ass, man.  Come on.  We grew up.  That was our era, man.  The 80s, man.  Tom, you want to hear that?  Go get on Napster and download the MP3s and make a fun little thing for you.  I don't have a sound card on my computer.  Hey, anyway, I go down there and fight Stap. 
[00:25:30]  Huh?  I want to fight Stap.  Fight?  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  I don't even want to know.  Stap?  Who's Stap?  Is that another person that has a weekend show around there?  Hey, it's the Stap Show.  I think the cleaning guy around here has a show on any W.  The Stap Show.  Yeah, we're rocking you through the weekend on any W.  It's not the home of rock and roll or New York Rocks or whatever the F we used to say.  If you're in the game.  Powered by Opie and Anthony. 
[00:26:00]  You won't be hearing this anymore.  Oh, Jesus.  Smash me.  Smash me.  Smash.  Smash.  Oh, well.  You're not going to get your Billy Squire fix this coming weekend.  Ouch.  Jack, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, man.  I mean, the weekend show now makes like Mixed Bag from years ago look like quality radio.  Remember when N.E.W. was playing Mixed Bag?  Mixed Bag.  It was like folk music from Alabama on Sunday morning. 
[00:26:30]  It's like scumbag is what weekends are.  It's an embarrassment to not just people that work here at N.E.W. during the week.  It's an embarrassment to anyone that is in New York radio to tune in N.E.W. and see that they're just giving shows to whoever the hell wants one.  Jesus Christ.  Or we're at a talk station.  We should do some talking on the weekend or something.  Or figure out something.  Or some kind of like theme.  Maybe have some kind of music concept weekend or something.  But you tune it in.  You have to hear that lick ass.  Then you tune it in.  Come on.  Then you hear something that sounds like college radio. 
[00:27:00]  Then you tune it in and you hear moldy, oldy, classic rock and roll.  These jocks on the weekends, they get to play whatever the hell they want.  And what are they playing?  They're playing The Stroke by goddamn Billy Squire.  I know.  I'm waiting for that.  Like Yes documentary on the new Yes album or something.  Like, you know, to come on around 7 o'clock now on Saturdays.  It's horrible.  Thank you, Jack.  Take care, man.  Bye.  Occasionally, oh my God, driving home on Sunday night.  If you pop in goddamn N.E.W., I don't know what's going on.  You feel like you're in a time warper.  I don't know what's happening over there. 
[00:27:30]  1952 again or something.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Listen, Saturday.  I'm listening to the radio.  I turn on WNEW.  And just after you guys smash the Bruce Springsteen records and the CDs,  they're freaking playing Bruce Springsteen.  I got disgusted.  I had to turn it off.  Well, we don't want to be responsible for what you guys hear on the weekends here at N.E.W.  I know.  And we really want to thank you very much.  I'm a city cop.  And I really like what you did about Bruce Springsteen.  But thanks a lot.  And, hey, Diamond Dust, what's your 20? 
[00:28:00]  Because I'm over here now.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  What's your 20, Opie?  And why the hell do we have a whole Bruce Springsteen catalog back in the station?  It's back.  Oh, no.  The whole stack.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  He just lunged the whole stack.  There's got to be 30 CDs against the wall.  Oh, my God.  We're going to play a new game.  Guess who gets fired next? 
[00:28:30]  Oh.  We don't run a sweeper that says powered by Opie and Anthony for the hell of it.  Trust me.  Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing.  It's kind of embarrassing saying powered by Opie and Anthony.  And then you hear college radio, pretty much.  As opposed to this mature radio you're hearing now.  Award win.  It's just a goddamn disaster.  What should we do on the weekends?  What should this station do? 
[00:29:00]  I got some ideas, but, you know, I'll talk to the bosses about it tomorrow.  We've got to do something because it's an embarrassment.  It's an embarrassment, man.  Hey, I listen to you guys all week, so I figure, hey, I'll check out N.E.W. on the weekend.  Yeah.  And then you've got some infomercial for, like, hemorrhoid cream or something.  You're not going to...  Oh, my God, Ben.  The whole...  Ben just...  Ben just hit the wall of CDs with a CD. 
[00:29:30]  And I think it took out three CDs that were in the library.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what the hell that was.  I think ACGC just bought it with a magic eight ball.  No, no, don't throw that.  The blue liquid will come out.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no.  You're out of control, man.  Don't break all the CDs until we know what the F's going to happen here on weekends.  TJ, what's going on?  Hey, you guys think it's bad when they play on the weekends during the days and the evenings?  You guys need to wake up early and listen. 
[00:30:00]  It's like infomercials for people who write medical books.  I swear to God.  Yeah.  It's the worst thing in the world.  Yeah, we want to be proud of this goddamn station.  We're doing really well.  There's a couple other shows starting to show something in the ratings.  And then on the weekends, it's just a disaster out here.  Why don't you guys play like the best of, you know, on the weekends?  Because I don't want to be associated with the weekend programming.  There you go.  You're going to have some jock that doesn't even belong on college radio and then go into, you know, the best of O&A after that? 
[00:30:30]  We don't want to be associated with it.  Unlike other stations, they're not going to just use our name during every other day part and every weekend to try to get people to listen.  Like on the weekends, what, are we supposed to, like, throw our name in there just so people think that we're going to be on or something?  And then they catch bad music and bad, like, yapping in between the songs? 
[00:31:00]  Larry, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I like you guys a lot, but I just don't understand.  Why do you want them not to play any classic rock on the weekends?  I don't care.  No, it's the same old, moldy, classic rock you've heard a million freaking times on the radio.  So you just don't want the same old stuff?  You'd rather they play?  I'd have a little more respect if they'd started playing deeper cuts or something, but they could play whatever they want.  You tune in the radio, you're hearing sweet emotion.  Who cares?  I've heard that song a million times. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  No wonder freaking people at home are programming their own goddamn radio stations on their computer.  They're sick of this crap.  Thank God for Napster.  I was talking to some people this weekend, and they're like, you know, I don't listen to music radio anymore.  What I do is I go to Napster.  I download the stuff I want.  I'm putting it in my computer, and then I hit, you know, shuffle, and I got my own radio station with songs I want to hear. 
[00:32:00]  Power down.  We need a sweeper for the weekends that says Opie and Anthony are not responsible for this crap.  Yeah.  They'll be back Monday at 2.  Ugh.  Yeah, it's painful when you're driving around on the weekend.  Oof.  I don't even visit NEW on the weekends.  It's just sometimes I get in the car, and it's been on from Friday night or something when I'm driving home.  It's when I get in the truck, and I start driving. 
[00:32:30]  I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, dear, sweet Jesus.  What station is this?  It goes from, might as well be CBS FM, and then it goes to Q, and then it's trying to be K-Rock, and then I really don't know what the hell they're doing.  It's about time we figure it out, though, man.  And then, come on!  Ugh.  Doug, what's going on?  Like a bad rash that won't go away.  Doug.  That's it, fellas.  I was just calling, like the one guy said before, how you guys get all these infomercials on the weekends, early mornings. 
[00:33:00]  It's just guys are calling up and talking to whoever and saying that, oh, you know, we got this new colon cream and this and that.  It's like, who the hell really cares about that?  Nobody's listening to it.  They're just wasting time.  You guys should go back to before, how, like, you came up with the idea about coming up with the power switch and just shutting everything down for the weekend.  Save the company some money.  Power down.  Yeah.  Thank you, Doug.  All right.  Syndication with Spaz owns Ranch One.  There it is. 
[00:33:30]  Powering down.  What?  What's wrong?  What do you got?  What's the problem with everybody?  Obviously, Psycho Mark is taking video.  No, I did.  Yeah?  This is from this weekend.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, cool.  Oh, my God.  Psycho Mark with an army helmet on behind a huge gun and a jeep.  Oh, that was over the weekend, huh?  Yeah, he went to the Teterboro Air Show.  I heard that was wild.  Oh, my God.  None of the planes crashed, though, huh?  There was another air show. 
[00:34:00]  Disaster in Philly.  Pennsylvania.  Oh, Pennsylvania.  Oh, my God.  That was the guys from the 44th.  That's good.  It's Psycho Mark behind a 50 cow.  A gag, gag, gag, gag.  Frightening.  Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Great.  Yesterday, about 12 o'clock, I was on my way out and I put on the station.  And the DJ, whoever it was, is complaining that there's people asking for Bruce Springsteen's song.  So he's talking about, oh, they'll go out and they'll get some more or something like that.  And he was also complaining about old smells and particles of food and stuff from Friday's show in there, too. 
[00:34:30]  And who was this?  I don't know the guys' name.  He was on at 12 o'clock yesterday, so the woman in there with him, like, his help or whatever.  Was it 12 o'clock at night?  No, 12 o'clock yesterday afternoon, between 11.30 and 12.  And they're complaining about the smell of the studio?  They're complaining about the smell of the studio and that they need Bruce Springsteen CDs and stuff like that.  Too bad.  Go work somewhere else.  That's what I said.  We've won this place now, like it or not.  Right.  Thank you, Dennis. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you, Ben.  Thank you.  Did we break all the Bruce Springsteen CDs again?  Now they're going to have to go out and get a whole other catalog.  This would be the third one.  Are there any left, Ben?  No, they're done.  They're done?  Good.  Ponderous.  It's effing ponderous.  And the studio doesn't smell.  We cleaned up the whole mess from Friday.  Yeah, why?  Who said that?  Actually, I didn't clean up anything.  No, it was Ben and Rick and Spaz and Stinky.  They get all the credit.  They worked their asses off after we finished that broadcast on Friday, Anthony.  After we destroyed the place. 
[00:35:30]  It smelled so friggin' bad.  Oh, my God.  So let's take a break.  We have nothing to do with the weekend programming here.  We're embarrassed.  Yeah, please.  It's an absolute embarrassment.  I guess it's schizophrenic radio on the weekends.  I don't know.  I guess it just took so long to get the weekdays in order.  And then, I don't know, they forgot about the weekends? 
[00:36:00]  What's going to be done?  Anyone know?  Is there any clue?  I don't know.  Are we going to have to listen to bad music and bad chatter between the songs?  And then, the Sunday evening debacle?  Yeah.  I thought it was cool to hear, you know, powered by Opie and Anthony every hour.  But then I realized, whoa.  This is being heard in the middle of this crap programming on the weekends.  Oh.  I want to have hypocrites about Bruce. 
[00:36:30]  Whatever.  Whatever, Kev.  Whatever.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, Oak.  Yeah.  How are you doing, buddy?  Good.  A long time ago, when tracks came out, you guys were the first ones to play it.  What?  When tracks?  Yeah.  You guys were the first ones to release the new songs?  Yeah.  I never said I didn't like Bruce Springsteen.  No, but you guys were loving the song.  Now you're trashing him.  I'm trashing what he did to the fine police of this fine city.  But if you ever liked Bruce at any point in your life, nothing can happen that can change that?  Oh, no, no, not at all. 
[00:37:00]  But, I mean, you're trashing him like he was, you know, trashed the whole time.  No, that's not true.  Really?  Are we?  That's not what we're saying.  Is that what we're doing, or do you just sound very silly right now, Kevin, and you're trying to defend yourself?  We're getting a reaction out of the Bruce Springsteen fans, and that's kind of like the reaction that, you know, you get from the cops  when they have to sit there and listen to Bruce sing a song about Diablo.  Has anybody heard the whole song yet?  Yes!  We're not talking about it today.  All right.  We went over this for like three, four hours.  Where were you?  I don't know.  I was there.  I was here.  Yeah, no, you weren't. 
[00:37:30]  So all the Bruce Springsteen CDs are smashed again?  Yeah, that's it.  There you go.  Go get some more.  None more.  Go get some more.  Hint, hint.  Don't keep them in the studio.  Hint, hint.  Look at that big gaping hole in the wall.  Yeah.  Oops.  Yeah, and Earl's got a show.  Why does Earl have a show?  Does Earl have a show on the weekends?  Sometimes.  Is it just that I'm hoping, I'm really hoping that this is being done because they don't  want to hire people because they have a plan for the weekend. 
[00:38:00]  And like, you know, hiring professionals would be kind of silly.  So if you want to come up to NAW and have your own show, I guess that's what they're doing now.  I would just, you know, have people line up.  Have people line up at the NAW door and just invite them to come in, you know, and DJ for  an hour.  An hour each.  Earl lives in our office.  That's so true.  That's another story.  I didn't even know what was happening. 
[00:38:30]  I heard this little confrontation in the office before the show, and I'm just chuckling.  It seems Opie came back after he was out.  What night was that?  Friday night?  No, it was after the Thursday night.  It was after the Jekyll and Hyde.  Yeah.  Years ago.  A lot of people are asking, you know, how was it and stuff.  And, you know, I wish I could sit here and do like a 20, 30 minute bid on Sebastian Bach  as the lead in Jekyll and Hyde.  It really wasn't that bad.  Yeah.  I would love to be able to abuse him and stuff, but the guy did a really good job.  What am I going to say? 
[00:39:00]  It's not my cup of tea.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go see this.  I got tickets for my birthday, and my girlfriend, I assumed that she was going to bring, you  know, a family member, a friend, but no.  I assumed wrong.  She wanted to bring me.  I went.  I wasn't happy that I was going.  I went there, and what can I tell you?  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad?  And he's a talented mother effer.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  And that's what I have to say about that, you know?  That's all I have to say.  When he turns into Hyde, he sounds just like, you know, Sebastian from, you know, Skid Row. 
[00:39:30]  Just screaming his brains out.  All right.  There you go.  But I give him a lot of credit.  What can I say?  A rousing review.  No?  A rousing review of Jekyll and Hyde.  Sebastian.  It was all right.  Not my cup of tea.  Don't twist this, but it was all right.  No, they'll twist it.  Don't worry.  I was there, and I, you know, it was a little slow near the end of the first act, but then  I, you know, and then it was intermission, and then everyone started laughing at me because  they saw I was there.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:40:00]  But I'm looking at those guys like, well, you got dragged.  You're here, too, so shut up.  Right.  So.  All right.  So what were we going to say?  You got back to the office after the show.  What time was that about?  It was late.  It was, I don't know, 1130, I guess.  1130.  I don't know.  After 11.  You come back to the office to pick up the stuff that you left here.  And I'm checking my email and messages before I, you know, grab my stuff and head home.  Sure.  And this fine-looking black lady comes walking into the office.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  With a ton of stuff.  Stuff.  It looked like an overnight bag and all sorts of crap.  Oh, really?  And she just camps out in our office.  And I'm like, excuse me, what are you doing in my office?  Yeah.  Saying my, because I'm the only one there at the time.  She goes, oh, Earl told me to put my stuff down in the office.  Well, you got to understand, our office is like Pee Wee's Playhouse, but it is only for  the people involved with the Opie and Anthony show, period.  That is it.  No one else is to go in and out of there, play with our toys or anything else. 
[00:41:00]  Wait, I'm getting interrupted again.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on with you?  Okay, you're going AWOL on Bruce Springsteen.  I understand.  You don't appreciate his opinion that he boys about the viala and the show.  Let me finish.  Okay.  Let me finish.  Go ahead.  You're going to babble.  Get to your point.  No, I'm not babbling.  Because I see what you want to say on the screen, and I'm pissed off.  Since when do we live in Russia?  I mean, everybody's inside of their own opinion just because it's criticized.  Exactly.  Right.  Don't ever say we're against free speech, Rick.  Did we say that Bruce should be taken off the airwaves or not doing the show? 
[00:41:30]  We never said he didn't have the right to do what he did.  And we have the right to say that he's an AWOL, so.  We have the right to react, and this is how we're reacting.  So how is that going against free speech, Rick?  Can I say something?  Go ahead.  What I'm saying is you both are entitled, you and the Bruce Springsteen, to say your own opinion.  What I'm saying is you guys are coming down hard on him because he's got a song that contradicts your view.  You know something?  Disagreeing with someone's point of view doesn't mean you don't think they should have the right to say it. 
[00:42:00]  I know, but you never said he shouldn't say it.  We never said he didn't have the right to say it, you idiot.  We never said he didn't have the right to sing that song.  He did what he did, and we're reacting to what he did.  Why are you backing down his CDs?  That's what I don't get.  Because we don't like it.  Because of what his song he sang, right?  We're not going to record stores and breaking them and protesting that he shouldn't be in the stores. 
[00:42:30]  Okay, I just want to say one last thing.  You guys rock.  Have a great show.  Oh, my God.  I love that.  You guys come down very hard on him.  Yes, so?  Yeah.  We should come down lighter, and that would show that we think he has the freedom to say what he wants?  Shut up.  That's the whole point of free speech.  We're reacting to what he did.  Out of the Bruce Springsteen fans, Anthony.  Did we dump out of there?  Probably.  Oh, who knows?  Whatever. 
[00:43:00]  Whoa, Knobloch.  Jesus.  What did Knobloch throw to first?  So, getting back to the Earl thing, yeah.  So, this lady, she starts camping out in the office, and I look up, and she's not even acknowledging me or anything.  I'm like, excuse me, what are you doing in my office?  Oh, Earl told me it was all right to, you know, come down here and put my stuff in the office.  And it was obvious that she's been there before because she's camping out.  Like, she knows where the remote control is for the TV.  Right.  You don't just...  She's near Rick's counter space. 
[00:43:30]  She's been there before.  Now, you can tell when you look at somebody and their whole demeanor in an environment if they're comfortable there.  Now, if you, let's say, were told to just sit somewhere, first time ever, you were told to just sit somewhere,  wouldn't you look a little uncomfortable?  You wouldn't touch anything.  You would sit there like you do in a waiting room and maybe look around a little bit, but she looked comfortable.  She looked like I've done this a million times and I'm hanging out like I do every week waiting for Earl to get done with his job. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  So, she's sitting in the office, remote, very comfy.  And Spaz could add to the story.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because Spaz comes here every weekend.  Spaz works his ass off, by the way.  He doesn't get a day off.  He doesn't do anything, but he's working.  Yeah, right.  But he's here.  I guess you help out Eddie Trunk's Saturday Night Rock show.  Yes, I do.  Okay, and the point you want to make is that every Saturday I come in, the office door is open and everything is turned on. 
[00:44:30]  And it's screwed on the desk.  Yeah.  And see, when we leave Friday, we turn off everything.  Yes.  They lock the door.  Oh, boy.  And Earl's here.  All right.  Earl has a MASA key.  Yep.  He's got a MASA key.  No, Earl will not have a key to our office.  That's it.  He's abused any...  He doesn't even have a privilege to go in there.  Yeah, he's not involved with this program anymore, and he should not have access to our office. 
[00:45:00]  Our office is fun, fun, fun.  It's like Disney, our office.  I told Earl and everyone else, if the guys are hanging out in there, because we have, what, five guys that camp out in our office.  Yeah.  That's their space.  I said, if we're in there and we're hanging out and having fun, we don't care who hangs out with us.  But while we're not there, we don't need, like, strangers walking around, putting their stuff down, knowing where the remote control is, and feeling very comfortable in our office.  Yeah, that's a little much.  And then she gives me an attitude, because I say...  Give you an attitude. 
[00:45:30]  Because I'm like, you have to leave.  This is in Earl's office.  Earl was moved.  Earl told me to come down here.  I'm like, well, this is in Earl's office.  You sit out in Earl's cubicle.  Oh, brother.  And I know he's in there watching the TV.  There's Earl.  He's in the death.  See, you never get a straight answer out of him.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought he was out there.  Get a good clip.  Get a good clip that you can isolate now and put on the website. 
[00:46:00]  Very good.  I know.  What do you think?  I'm silly?  Oh, okay.  Steve C.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com has decided to get a little clip of Anthony's new hairdo.  Yes, and I just isolated it.  It's very crisp.  Thank you.  Very good.  It doesn't look so bad.  Well, you know, no.  I'd seen in Boston.  I'd seen that big thing.  Yeah.  That's what you had in Boston.  Oh, it was very poofy.  In comparison.  My hair was poofy.  All right.  It was very poofy. 
[00:46:30]  Let's take a break, Anthony.  Okay.  I thought Earl was fired.  I don't know.  This is the only place you can work where you don't get fired.  He's busy.  He doesn't do anything.  I don't know what he does at this point.  We've goofed about this time and time again.  But the guy's been here for, I mean, a million years.  And we don't know what he does.  But we know one thing.  He uses our office.  He invites guests down.  And he'll deny it.  Well, great.  We're going to get a master lock with a big padlock.  Massa lock.  We're going to get that big freaking padlock. 
[00:47:00]  We're going to, we're going to, we'll, we'll lock it up.  No.  A little combination.  I'm just going to go take his master key right now.  He shouldn't have a master key.  Why does he have a master key?  We didn't even have a key to the goddamn pisser when we got here.  And he's got a master key to, to all the offices.  He could walk into anyone's office.  Yeah.  Why does Earl need to, the, the, the PD doesn't have a master key.  PD, go up to Ken. 
[00:47:30]  Ken, the GM.  Ken Stevens doesn't have a master key.  Our GM does not have a master key.  Earl needs access to every inch of WNEW.  For what?  For what?  Steve, you see all the Bruce Springsteen CDs all over the floor?  Yeah.  Who did this?  Was it, was that you that did the bulk of that damage?  I took out about 10 CDs in one, one fell swoop.  And, and these were the ones that just showed up?  Yeah.  Good for you.  Yeah.  There's a big hole in the, in the, in the wall where the Bruce Springsteen used to go.  Someone sent me a really high quality MP3 of the, uh, American Skin, uh, song that he did. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  And they, you know, saying, put it up on the site, put it up on the site.  And absolutely not.  No.  Absolutely not.  Song's not even that good.  No, that, that's, that's the biggest travesty.  Oh, if someone wants to know if you put Earl's, uh, chick into attack mode with your comments.  Did she, did she go into attack mode or did she get up and leave?  No, I mean, there's more to this story too.  Uh, Earl had one of his little, uh, female flunkies call my voicemail and bitch you and I out for, 
[00:48:30]  for doing that whole break on the invisible man saying that she was the one in the studio.  And how much she hates us and, and what any W has become.  And you and I are the antichrist, all this.  And then at the end of the message said, said, and if you put this on the air, I'll sue you.  So we couldn't, we couldn't do anything with this, uh, this phone call that was left on my voicemail.  And so now I'm looking at this girl in the office going, there's a good possibility.  This could be the girl.  Yeah.  You hate us so much, but you're in our office.  Get the F out.  It's not cool. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  I didn't even think about that.  We don't know if it was because Earl won't tell us who it was.  She certainly wouldn't.  Because this girl just laid, laid, just laid into us on my, uh, my voicemail.  Laid into us about, you know, how, uh, we were abusing Earl, about the invisible man.  And I just want to set the record straight.  I was in the studio that day and I don't like what any W has become.  And you guys are the antichrist.  You're not funny.  Blah, blah, blah.  Don't put this on the air.  Right.  That's why we never talked about it.  And it might be her.  I don't know.  Earl just backpedaled his ass off when, uh, you confronted him with this. 
[00:49:30]  Said the girl was in here.  What is she doing in, in our office, Earl?  And, uh, he was like, no, no, no.  I told her, um, to sit by my office, my cubicle.  She thought it was the old office that I used to be in.  So she went to that office and sat.  No, it just didn't make any sense.  Completely got caught because the odds of, uh, you and I or anyone from the show being  in our office around 1130 on a weeknight, very slim.  Very slim. 
[00:50:00]  Very slim.  Very slim.  He got caught.  So I came back after the Jekyll and Hyde.  All right, now we got to take a break.  Yeah.  We're playing clips from, uh, Friday show all day long here today.  Mm-hmm.  From the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Unbelievable show.  What?  Dude, he's coming.  He's mad at Rick.  Why is he mad at Rick?  I don't know.  He's like, I'm coming down there.  I'm going to explain it to myself.  Well, he better.  He better.  Come on.  Earl, what'd you like to explain yourself?  About what part? 
[00:50:30]  About hanging out in our office after hours.  We weren't hanging out in our, your office.  Why was that chick in our office last Thursday?  Because the last time she was here, I was in that office.  She came up here.  We were going to hang out later.  I said, sit at my desk.  I'll be there in a minute.  Is she the girl that was in here when you were on the air?  No.  All right.  I wasn't sure about that part.  You met her.  You met her.  That girl I never met before.  She was on the air before.  Never met her.  I swear to God, she was on the air before.  I don't remember. 
[00:51:00]  Did you give us the master key?  Why don't you have a master key?  I don't have a master key.  I don't have any keys.  You could get into any freaking door here.  No, I don't.  You have a key to our office.  No.  I don't have any keys.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you just say you do?  I don't.  I do not have any keys.  People have caught you in our office on the weekends.  Caught me in a...  Because the door is open on the weekends.  Oh, my God. 
[00:51:30]  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  I have no reason to lie.  Why am I going to sit here and lie to you guys?  Because the story you just told about the girl is different than the story you told about the girl before the show.  Now you're saying, well, she thought I still had that office.  No, I said...  When you told me the story before the show, you said, well, I told her my space or my office was around the corner.  Around the corner.  Which is your cubicle.  Which is nowhere near our office. 
[00:52:00]  So you lied.  No.  She thought I was still in the office.  I'm going to start taping every conversation I have with you just to prove my point.  You're telling two different stories now.  I'm not telling two different stories.  Because what do you say?  I said, around the corner.  You know, in the corner.  She thought I was still in the old office.  That's why she was in the office.  Getting really comfortable.  Pretty much looking for the remote control.  And I told you guys before the show.  We had valuable radio secrets in that office.  It was a misunderstanding, and I apologized for it. 
[00:52:30]  Just a simple misunderstanding.  You're fired!  That'll never happen.  I thought you quit, Earl.  Didn't you quit?  Not really.  No?  No.  You did?  No, I said I quit.  We have audio of you quitting.  You're lying again.  I had to do it.  I just...  When you say I quit, that's quitting.  And we have audio of that.  Earl's the only guy that quits, but then shows up to work.  I was really upset about the sticker.  You want us to break out the audio where you say, you guys, I've had enough.  Yeah, I've had enough with the sticker stop.  Where's Jeremy? 
[00:53:00]  Where's Jeremy?  I need to talk to him.  I said, why?  And you said, because I quit.  We have audio of that.  So don't say you didn't quit.  You quit.  That's lying again.  I meant quit doing the sticker stops.  I really lost my temper right there.  See, you twist everything.  You twist every single thing.  I'm not twisting everything.  So you quit the sticker stops, which is the only part, your only job, but you're still part of the station.  At the time, that was your only job except for the Sunday morning programming thing.  What are you doing today, Earl? 
[00:53:30]  What's on Earl's agenda for today?  Their agenda today, we're very close to getting someone for a future event.  Without really getting, it involves you guys.  Okay, great.  So you've been working on that.  Tell us when we can announce this special someone for an event that I don't even know about.  LB, you know who it is?  It's the Invisible Man.  In negotiations. 
[00:54:00]  I'm the Invisible Man.  With the Invisible Man.  Oh, our former intern on the line.  All right.  Do you want to admit anything before we put him on the air?  Do you want to admit anything?  Guys, you know as well as I would never do anything deliberately to hurt myself.  I understand that, but I don't like you lying to us.  And I know you lie to us.  Just tell the truth.  Lying about what?  Have you ever gotten into our office?  Yes, I've gotten into your office.  Because it was unlocked, right? 
[00:54:30]  When it was unlocked?  Yeah.  When it was unlocked, yes.  Have you ever gotten into our office when it was locked?  When I needed to, yes.  How?  You said you don't have a key.  I don't have a key.  Then how do you get in there?  I got it through the chief engineer.  On weekends?  Pete doesn't work here on weekends.  He doesn't work during the week.  Oh, he only works during the week.  You have a key to our office.  I don't care how you get it.  You have a key.  I do not have a key.  Psycho Mark?  I know what he does. 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  He goes into Pete's office, right?  There's a master key box hidden in there with all the keys to all the offices.  Is that it?  And he sneaks into it and gets the key out.  I do not sneak into it.  You do, and don't lie.  You go right into that box.  So, technically, wait a minute, let me think of this.  Technically, you can use the key to get in our office.  You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't only get in there when the door's unlocked.  Hold on, hold on.  Technically, you don't own a key on your key chain, a key to our office.  But, but, you have access 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to a key. 
[00:55:30]  Not 24 hours, no.  Well, you have access all the time to keys.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  You lie all the time.  I'm leaving.  I'm out.  I'm going.  Oh, because you know I?  Because you know we got you.  Yeah, he's all pissed because we got him.  Wait, come back here.  John has something for you.  John, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  John, our former intern. 
[00:56:00]  How you doing?  What's up?  Every Saturday, I used to come in there to do a demo tape.  Every door was open in the studio.  He has keys to every office in there.  No, he has access to a master key that could get in any goddamn office.  The lights were on in the office, everything, man.  Yeah, yeah, TV.  TV was on.  Yeah, our office is fun.  I would want to go in there on the weekend.  He rules the studio on Saturdays.  It's like he's the king in there.  Oh, boy.  Thank you, John.  It's so funny.  He just denied that he had a master key, which means, you know, in his head he could rationalize 
[00:56:30]  it.  I do not have a master key.  I catch up.  Because he doesn't have it.  But he can walk into this place and open up a box that has a master key at any given moment  and have access to the thing.  Yet he says he doesn't have a master key.  Right.  And someone else has it, but I have access to it all the time.  Did anyone else?  It's a lie.  Did anyone else out there hear where he said he has been in our office only when it's  unlocked?  Right.  We all heard that.  Yep.  And now we found out that, yes, when he needs to get in there, he will get the master key 
[00:57:00]  and use it.  That is called lying.  He's lying.  No, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  And then he gets pissed.  Oh, oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  And everyone knows where this master key is.  Why don't we know where it is?  Where did you get the master key from?  There was one time Ant needed to get back into our old office.  He had to break in.  He had to, like, climb up and over the top. 
[00:57:30]  Here's a gentleman.  We had to drop ceiling.  We had to go up and over.  Where did you get your master key?  I got it from a Negro.  See, it must have been Earl.  Maybe it's time to tell the GM that there's a master key where anyone can get into our office.  We still have a lot of enemies that work here at NEW that don't really like us and would  probably love to get into our office.  Oh, my God.  That might be smart.  Oh. 
[00:58:00]  God.  He just, like, did not, like, he's trying to skirt the issue.  The key, that's classic.  No, I don't have a key.  But you have access to a key whenever you want one.  Define key.  Yeah.  What do you mean by key?  I did not have sex with that lock, ever.  And then we catch a line and he gets pissed and he wants to.  I'm on the hall. 
[00:58:30]  I'm leaving.  You caught me.  I don't have a key.  Well, I have a key, but I don't have a key.  I don't have a key.  I have a key.  Well, I didn't want to see Chuck.  I don't have a key.  Chuck from the radio.  I have a key.  Chuck from the radio chick show is black, right?  I think so.  All right.  All right.  Just checking.  Sam from Long Island.  Master key.  Just like a black man to abuse something called master. 
[00:59:00]  That doesn't make sense.  It's not even a funny joke.  It's nothing to do with race.  Please.  Please, Sam.  All right.  We talked about the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony, from Friday.  Everyone is talking about this show, Five Girls in the Barrel.  We threw everything we had at them, including sour milk and fish guts and chum and honey and syrup and beer.  It was just disgusting.  The smell was just so rank.  You can't even describe the smell. 
[00:59:30]  Fish.  Just imagine the worst smell you ever smelled and times it by two or three.  Anyway, there's a ton of pictures, 170 of them on www.com.  Steve from foundrymusic.com, who's in the studio, has some pictures up on the website already,  and he's just received the video tapes from the event itself.  From the event.  So now you can get to see some video clips in the coming days on foundrymusic.com.  So as we go to break, another clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  Yes.  The girls are in the barrels, and it's early on as we start dumping things into the barrel. 
[01:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  One, two, seven.  WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Bud Light.  We love Bud Light.  Bud Light, I say.  Bud Light.  We drink it.  Back office, after the show, and we're kicking Earl out of our office.  Nothing goes down better than an icy cold Bud Light.  What do you want us to say?  We love this stuff.  We drink it.  It's great.  Cool and refreshing.  Cold, easy to drink. 
[01:00:30]  I got one, Ed.  When you're at Yankee Stadium, a duck in the Chuck Knobloch throws to first base.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  What was that?  Make sure you protect the Bud Light that you have in your right hand.  Yeah, he'll pick it off.  The safest place to stand?  First base.  That's right.  You won't get hit by those Knobloch balls.  He's a head case, though, man.  Yeah.  Chuck is a head case.  It seems like the more people rag him about it, the worse he gets.  Remember when he made that error, what was it, two seasons ago, and then he had to see 
[01:01:00]  the psychologist and stuff?  Yeah.  He couldn't get over it.  He's just a head case.  He's freaking out now, because he, I mean, he can't freaking throw.  Unbelievable.  What are the Yankees doing losing four at home, too?  Ouch.  Ouch.  It's okay.  And, hey, they'll do fine.  You don't see the Mets losing four at Shea.  Oh, please.  Yeah, it's so late in the season.  Jesus Christ.  Not many games left.  Let me tell you something.  You guys should really start worrying about your pitching rotation.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  I don't believe me.  You guys got some serious holes in that pitching rotation.  It's okay.  We know how to pull it together.  Blah, blah, blah.  We know how to pull it together when it counts.  It's Robert Johnny.  Oh, yeah.  It's over.  It's over.  Come on.  It's over.  Very silly.  Bud Light.  Great beer to drink watching the Yankees.  Mets.  No, for the Mets, you drink some slill.  Bud Light. 
[01:02:00]  Make it a Bud Light all summer long.  Bud Light.  The life of the party, Opie.  All right.  It's no lime needed with Bud Light.  Can I get through the rest of these?  We're proud Bud Light drinkers.  We don't agree on our baseball team, but we agree on our light beer.  Right, Anthony?  Bud Light.  Bud Light, I said.  Thank you.  It's Bud Light.

Mike, what's going on?  What's up, guys, man?  Saturday night, they had a story on the Amityville Horror House.  And my friend Nick ran in the background with a huge wow sign. 
[01:03:00]  That was you, huh?  I got a ton of email on that.  Dude, it was so awesome.  We're sitting in the house, we're watching it, and this kid's running outside running around.  It was nuts.  Are you from that neighborhood?  Yeah, I live in Amityville.  I guess there was a huge red wow sign behind the reporter?  Huge.  And then one of you guys were yelling at the reporter or something when he was live?  Yeah, my friend.  What was he yelling?  I have no clue.  I completely forgot.  Yeah, because the email came in like crazy for that.  Just to let you know, on Friday night's Channel 7, 11 o'clock news, there was a very clear wow sighting. 
[01:03:30]  There was a reporter in front of the Amityville Horror House, and all of a sudden, from the right side of the screen,  someone holding a huge white sign with wow in big red letters came across the screen.  We laughed our asses off.  Yo, me and a friend made the news Friday.  This must be you.  June 16, 2000, when I got a wow sign on the 11 o'clock news outside the Amityville Horror House.  Very cool, man.  It was, dude, it was so sweet, man.  Yeah.  Well, congratulations on that, man.  All right, man.  Now you're part of legend.  Yes, no doubt about it. 
[01:04:00]  All right, Mike, thanks for that.  All right.  Oh, they rules, baby!  Yeah.  Woo!  Wow, look at that.  Peace!  We rule, Anthony.  Mm.  Thank you.  Well, we got to...  Send out, uh, get well wishes to, uh, Mr. Imus, Anthony.  Mm.  Yes.  Oh, my goodness.  What?  Is, is Imus insane?  Is he crazy?  I think he was feeling bad that the press hasn't talked about him in a while and figured, 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  I got to do something here.  I got to, uh, collapse a lung.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ho, destiny.  Ho, ho, ho.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, let me read this a little bit.  Yeah.  Get well, get well wishes going out to Mr. Imus.  He's hospitalized.  Uh, radio host Don Imus was hospitalized with multiple injuries after being thrown from  a horse at his ranch in New Mexico.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah, yeah, baby.  Imus suffered five, five broken ribs. 
[01:05:00]  Five ponderous.  A collapsed lung, a broken collarbone, and a shoulder separation after being thrown up  to, uh, ten feet off a horse.  Ten feet?  Ten feet.  Ho, destiny.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's, that's what happened to Christopher Reeve.  I mean, I don't, I don't want to bring that up, but he's lucky.  My big, uh, fag cowboy hat broke my fall.  It saved, saved you from breaking your neck, Mr. Imus. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, uh, my, no, that was my, uh, my fag bandana around my neck.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, that saved me from, uh, oh, shut up, McCord.  I guess the fan was reporting this morning he's going to be out of commission for a little  while.  For a little while?  Yeah.  Five broken ribs, collapsed lung, broken collarbone, and a shoulder separation is going to be out for  a little while?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Shoulder separation, baby.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:06:00]  Well, I fall on glass.  Hey, you're using the same sound effect that, uh, that Anthony was using for the Chuck Knobblock  wild throw.  Well, uh, for some reason I don't have someone falling down on this, uh, machine.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ho, destiny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Good thing I didn't, uh, fall on my face.  Would have hurt the ground.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, shut up, Bernard, jerk.  420, Imus in the morning program. 
[01:06:30]  Actually, it was a Chuck Knobloch wild throw that knocked me off my horse.  Where's he, Albuquerque?  He's in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Oh, with that brother thing.  Oh, well, he does a good thing out there.  He gets a bunch of kids out there, special kids.  Special kids.  They hang out at his ranch. 
[01:07:00]  And a future dating prospect.  Oh, shut up, Anthony.  Hot call in the kettle black.  Hey, Barney, what's up?  Listen, the reason he fell off the horse was he read the ratings this morning.  Did you hear about the squealer beating him out for the last eight weeks?  Squealer?  The guy in 770.  Curtis.  Curtis in the morning. 
[01:07:30]  Curtis.  I don't know any Curtis's on the radio.  No, no, no.  The guy in 770, that guardian angel guy.  Guardian angel guy?  What?  They beat him out.  He beat him out for the last eight weeks.  A guy named Curtis?  Curtis Squealer.  Curtis Schwealer?  Schwealer.  Schwealer.  Come on, the guy on 770.  Curtis Schwealer.  No, Schwealer.  The guy that ran...  Who's the guy that ran the guardian angels?  Oh, God, that was like a thousand years ago, isn't it?  No, he's on 770, WABC in the morning. 
[01:08:00]  He beat him out for the last eight weeks.  And his name?  Look at the book.  What's his name, though?  Curtis.  Curtis said it was...  And then he got that lawyer guy on there.  I don't know who that guy is.  Curtis and the lawyer?  Yeah.  On WABC in the morning, 5 to 9.  Schwealer and the lawyer show?  No, no, no.  Come on, guys.  Schwealer and the lawyer.  No, no, no.  Curtis, what the hell do they call a show?  But anyway, I missed...  Came in second, or behind him.  They were so proud to beat I missed this month. 
[01:08:30]  He must have fell off the horse after reading it.  Came in second, right?  Yeah.  So, oh, really?  You guys must get the book.  Funny, I always thought Howard was number one in the mornings.  No, no, no.  For different sections.  You know how to write it down.  Different sections what?  Different sections what?  What?  What?  Get the book.  I don't understand what you're saying.  Schwealer and the lawyer beat Imus.  No, Curtis, Curtis, or whatever the hell his name is.  Schwealer and the lawyer beat Imus, who...  In the book that's not the book that other people are in.  No, no, no.  He beat the book.  He beat him in the ratings, guys. 
[01:09:00]  So...  Come on.  You didn't get the book today?  So now...  DJ and the bear.  So now...  DJ and the bear.  My own way.  So now Imus is in second?  No, he's in third.  Behind...  They're behind him.  But he beat...  This guy beat Imus.  So Imus must have read it and fell off the horse.  All right.  So some guy named...  Swealy and the lawyer.  Swealy and the lawyer.  Swealy and the lawyer beat Imus last month or the last eight weeks.  For second...  Yeah, yeah.  Read the book today, guys.  Where are you rating?  For the second place in the ratings.  But not in the ratings that the people that are number one in are in. 
[01:09:30]  You got it.  Now you got it.  Now you're on the same page.  Stosky and Hutch came in third.  Yeah, Tony and Anthony.  Okay.  So this Schwealy guy is bragging because he could beat Imus.  Yeah.  That's a huge accomplishment.  Swealy and the lawyer.  Does Swealy know that Imus is in, like, 20th grade?  Yeah, yeah.  You guys got it now.  Now you're on the right page.  Get the book out.  You guys must have got the book today.  Yeah, well, we don't need to brag about the ratings.  It just happens.  I understand.  I understand. 
[01:10:00]  We'll say thanks to our listeners a little bit.  Maybe, you know, get a beer or something.  That's about it.  I'll get two more.  We don't brag about moving up from 23rd place in morning radio to 21st.  There you go.  Take it easy.  Schwealy and the lawyer.  That's the guy, a Cuban Rican from Brooklyn that ran around with a beret on.  Well, tune in to Schwealy and the lawyer.  You've got to listen.  See you later.  All right.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, stop it.  The instant feedback.  We know.  Shut up.  Tool.  Schwealy and the lawyer checking in.  Is this guy insane?  Curtis Schwealy.  Only beat in one demo.  Curtis Schwealy.  Schwealy.  Schwealy.  Schwealy.  That's great.  We know.  Believe me.  Shut up.  So we want to wish Imas all the best. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Going to be in a body cast.  That'll be interesting.  Well, it's not like I move anyway.  I just sit there.  You ever see me on CNBC?  Yeah.  I sit there, and in between when we come on and go off.  Do your radio show?  Yeah, the show.  When you're riffing about stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Uh, I just sit there, and, um, my face melts as I sit there. 
[01:11:30]  The only part that moves are my jowls, my neck, and my forehead, uh, begins to melt.  Let me tell you, uh, a secret, uh, a trick we do.  Let me tell you a little trick we do at, uh, CNBC.  Yeah.  Because of, uh, it's, uh, TV.  You know.  Uh, shut up.  Jerk.  What we have to do, halfway through the program, uh, we turn the cameras upside down. 
[01:12:00]  Uh, and I am hanging by my feet, uh, because if I did the entire show sitting, my skin would  flap to the, uh, console.  Jesus.  So we film it upside down.  Yeah.  And by the end of the show, my skin is stretched back to the top of my head.  I got you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Baby.  Yeah.  Thank God my taffy-like nutsack broke my fall.  My old, shriveled nutsack.  Yeah, yeah.  Baby, Moby Worm coming to get you.  I'm praying to Reverend Billy Saul Hargis. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, yeah, MSNBC, CNBC, whatever.  Yeah.  I don't even know where I am.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a, in the morning.  Wah, wah.  Shut up, duck.  Jerk.  How about my brother's, uh, salsa?  I have nothing on that.  I'm just saying, how about it?  Buy it.  It's for a good cause, uh, special, uh, children.  That'll be dating.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Baby.  Yeah.  Collapsed lung, baby. 
[01:13:00]  Nothing's, uh, nicer to look at than, uh, Don Imus on the ground, bleeding from the mouth.  Baby.  All right, Mr. Imus, I hope you feel better.  Yeah.  Wherever you are, sir.  So do I.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, destiny.  Whoa, destiny.  All right.  Didn't I have a collapsed lung like ten years ago?  Uh, I don't know.  It just collapsed on its own.  It did. 
[01:13:30]  Ten years ago, uh, Don Imus had a, uh, collapsed lung.  Now I got a pair, baby.  All right.  Uh, maybe I shouldn't be riding horses.  Uh, when I was a kid, that was the only, uh, means of transportation.  Well, I figured I, uh, relived the, uh, oh, shut up, jerk.  He must look like the, the grandpa from South Park on a horse with a big hat on.  All right, Anthony, we're doing a WOW sticker stop today. 
[01:14:00]  Yes, where?  Uh, we're going to go to Washington Square Park today.  I think Psycho Mark needs to score.  Why did he pick that place today?  Running a little low?  Washington Square Park, 515.  Psycho Mark will be there handing out the WOW stickers.  And, uh, he'll have the WOW fan and all that, okay?  Okay.  What are you laughing at?  Just the instant feedback.  Well, well.  Wheeling in the lawyer.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:14:30]  All right, and another clip from our fifth.  Amazing, uh, Bob Hope is healthier than I am today.  Who thought we'd see the day?  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, bloody eyeballs, baby.  Looks like I'm coughing up, uh, my brother's salsa.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, shut up.  We got a, uh, another clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge from Friday, Anthony.  Yeah.  Pictures at www.com and pictures on foundrymusic.com.  We had five girls in barrel seeing who could last the longest.  And here's another clip early on in the festivities. 
[01:15:00]  Play it, help you, bud.  Play it, help you, bud.  Play it, help you, bud.  O.P. and Anthony.  More stupidity is on the way.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W-D.  Hey, Anthony, now for the New York Sports Club Summer If Only list.  Yes?  If only mosquitoes sucked fat.  If only tofu burgers were as nasty as barbecue cheeseburgers.

I got a lot of personnel. I mean, I got a lot of personnel.  Try that one, Anthony.  Anthony, you're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7 Pharma. 
[01:16:30]  Pharma.  Pharma.  I'm over here now.  Ow.  We were talking about Friday's show, the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  Yeah.  We had Tabitha's husband on the line and he hung up. I wasn't going to go to him right there.  He said he was deeply disturbed by the show, I believe. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, yeah?  I want to talk to him.  All the horrific screams from the girls were haunting me all weekend.  Pretty horrible.  The echo, the slight, like, reverb of them in the barrel.  Oh, horrifying screams.  Yeah, we have more clips to play today as the show goes on.  Grim Reaper checking in, Anthony, from hell.  Yeah.  I tried to get Imus, but he keeps sucking me.  Yeah.  Ow.  Boy, the lengths I have to go through to get painkillers. 
[01:17:30]  I remember I was hooked on those for quite some time.  Well, you've been off those for a while now, right?  Well, no.  Back on them now, baby.  Yeah, broken ribs.  Five broken ribs.  A collarbone and a...  Separated shoulder.  Yeah, yeah.  And a collapsed lung.  So, uh, back on the dope, baby.  Yeah.  Poor I-Man.  Crashing to the ground. 
[01:18:00]  Wouldn't you just...  Like, I don't know, a lot of joking's been made about how old he is, but how old is he?  I don't know.  Does anyone have the slightest idea, even close?  Uh, if I had to guess, I'd say, uh, 78.  Yeah, yeah.  Give or take, uh, well, a month.  I don't know how old he is, but to be, uh, hopping on a horse that can throw you ten feet...  He wants to be a cowboy, Anthony.  Destiny.  I want to be a cowboy, baby. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  With my big, fat cowboy hat and bandana.  Cowboy, baby.  Yeah, yeah.  Crashing to the ground and a-busting a rib.  Cowboy, baby.  Baby.  Cowboy, baby.  I smell a Fat Boy Slim mix coming on.  Cowboy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cowboy, baby.  Uh-huh, yeah.  Moby Worm.  Coming to get ya.  Whoa, hold on, Destiny.  Hold on, Destiny. 
[01:19:00]  Ho-ho.  Yeah, I got my, uh, big, fag, ten-gallon cowboy hat.  Head out west, baby.  With my brother, uh, bread and his salsa.  And now my arm needs a sweat.  Ha-ha-ha, baby.  Down your block, over the block.  Kid Imus.  Up and down the block.  On his ass.  Baby.  I'm rockin' that bitch up.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Destiny, ho. 
[01:19:30]  Ow, ouch.  Yeah.  That's the I-man's, uh, cowboy, baby.  At the top of the, uh, local hospital.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  I'm real, McCoy, and I'm headed out west, summer.  I wanna be a cowboy, baby.  I'm making it.  Shut up, Bernard.  Yeah, ha-ha.  Cause I'm a cowboy, baby.  Yeah, baby. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, ha-ha-ha.  I'm a cowboy.  Look at my big, fag, ten-gallon hat.  I got chaps and a bandana.  I'm a cowboy, baby.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Destiny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm a-coughin' up blood from my collapsed lung.  When my train rolls in, it goes...  Ow, ow.  That's the ambulance, uh, rollin' to get me.  Let's go.  I want you to slow.  Oh, okay.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  We need scampies and rice. 
[01:20:30]  Get a ball.  Oh, damn.  I need a new sound.  Then I'm gonna make my big, boy.  Yeah.  Cause I'm a big, fag cowboy, baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  I wanna be a cowboy, baby.  Whoa.  I wanna be a cowboy, baby.  I wanna be a cowboy, baby. 
[01:21:00]  I'm a big fat cowboy, baby.  Hey, someone stole the fire truck.  What happened there?  What happened to our fire truck?  I don't know.  Someone erased it. 
[01:21:30]  We need one of these for our own.  With the horn and everything, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got it?  Well, now we have it.  It's awful.  Ow.  Hold just a minute.  Yeah, because I'm a big fat cowboy, baby. 
[01:22:00]  With my cracked ribs and collapsed lung, I'm a cowboy, baby.  Spent all my time at the hospital.  Cowboy, baby.  Oh, Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on there?  I thought there was a memo.  We weren't allowed to talk about other people.  Yeah, that was good for, like, a week.  No, Mr. Imus could take a joke.  Yeah.  Mr. Imus can take a joke. 
[01:22:30]  I am like a better character.  No, Imus can take a joke.  Some people in this company have no sense of humor.  It can't take a joke.  The Imus can take a joke, even with a collapsed lung.  Even for the simple listener folks like me, I understand now.  All right.  I got the end all for syndication.  Can I do it?  Mr. Imus can take a joke.  Yeah.  Ah, syndication for you, for you, for what?  Forget about it.  All right, Kevin, thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  We wish Imus well, Anthony. 
[01:23:00]  Of course.  Hey, John.  John?  Yellow.  Did we lose John?  Hey, John, this is Tabitha's husband.  Tabitha was one of the ladies in the 55-gallon drum challenge this past Friday.  She was the hot blonde.  Thank you.  Hey, John, what's going on today?  Fellas, I cannot even begin to tell you how deeply, deeply disturbed I am.  It was unlike anything I could have ever had anticipated.  Yeah, because how bad did Tabitha smell? 
[01:23:30]  Bad.  Bad.  How many showers did she take over the weekend?  Well, she took three immediately following the show.  And that was the start of basically nonstop showering.  Yeah, because, I mean, she had syrup and honey in her hair and baked beans and fish guts and chum.  Have you, dude, have you gone south yet?  Yeah, you know, it wasn't really that pleasant, which is highly unusual. 
[01:24:00]  I mean, it's usually tremendous.  No, it's disturbing.  You're Tabitha's husband, obviously.  You were ten feet away from the festivities for three hours.  And you didn't mind that we were abusing your wife?  You know, at first, not at all.  You know, I was thinking, no problem, the syrup, the corn oil.  The woodpecker ciders bothered me because I brought those in to drink.  Yeah, we were pouring beer on the ladies.  Anything we could get our hands on.  The sour milk just stunk to high head.  Actually, it was sour cream. 
[01:24:30]  But not sour cream.  No, it was, yeah.  It was cream for your coffee that was sour.  How come sour cream is a lot different than sour cream?  We had sour cream, cream that you would use in your coffee, left on the heater for eight hours.  It smelled so bad, yet you would go to the store and buy sour cream.  Why do they call it sour cream?  Grandma, how could you eat sour cream and not be able to smell sour cream?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, it was just brutal, man. 
[01:25:00]  Hey, when you went down south, did a cockroach bite you in the nose?  No, it hit them.  So, what did she say after she left the studio?  I mean, what was the worst part?  Because I'm sure you guys have discussed this for the last few days.  At length.  I mean, it's been the only thing that we've talked about all weekend.  I mean, she was really, you know, it was almost like it were torture.  I mean, she was deeply, you know, really disturbed by it.  Oh, really?  Nightmares the whole nine yards. 
[01:25:30]  She had nightmares?  Yeah.  Man, you know how big this show was Friday.  We weren't effing around.  It was funny.  Tabitha, very different by the end of the contest.  In the beginning, she was really cocky.  She was boisterous.  She was throwing some of the stuff back out the holes at us.  And by the end, she was like trying to meditate in the barrel just to get through it.  She was just about to lose it, fellas.  You know, in fact, I think that if we'd have made them sit in there, you know, the remainder of the show, we'd have lost, you know, we'd have been down to one. 
[01:26:00]  And I think that person would have been Jane because she was just steeled, man.  I mean, there was like nothing that could have been done to her that would have phased her.  How did she do when we threw the hissing cockroaches in?  Like I'm telling you, that was the, you know, piece de resistance.  Just imagine being in a dark barrel you can't see and they're just dropping things on top of you.  And the damn thing is hissing right by her ear.  I'm telling you, it wasn't bad. 
[01:26:30]  You know, I figured I could handle the guys that had come in and paid $500 a piece to dump stuff because...  One guy paid $1,000.  Yeah, they're trying to support the show.  You know, they're doing the right thing.  However, it was the psychos that came in, you know, just walking off the street to dump stuff.  Yeah.  You know, it really, it bothered me severely.  We could tell a lot of people were saying, hey, I think Tabitha's husband's really pissed.  You know, at first I was off smiles, but man, I tell you what, by the end there, I was ready to rip that one guy with the flip glasses the hell off of there. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, who was that?  Which guy was that?  I don't know.  He had like 30, 40 listeners around the area for the whole show.  He was some psycho off the street and everyone was hovering around Christy's barrel.  Christy's the green one.  Christy's the big green one.  The big green one is Christy.  Well, this psycho was, you know, over at Tabitha's barrel, just constantly just dumping stuff in, like wagging her. 
[01:27:30]  At any point, were you going to take a swing at anyone?  I mean, you said you came close with that guy, but were you going to come in and say, guys, I've had enough, get my wife out of the barrel?  Now, that, I almost threw in the towel floor.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  That, when the guy with the flip glasses, you know, he just, he, like, was going over the line and he started pouring NyQuil into the barrels.  I'm serious.  Oh, that was the guy?  The guy with the NyQuil.  Just disturbed.  Yeah, that was Joe, man. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, that was Joey?  I like Joe.  Joe almost ripped his head off.  Yeah.  I didn't know that was him doing that.  But, John, how's Tabitha doing today?  She's doing all right?  She's doing great.  Actually, she's, right now, she's getting a root canal.  Oh, God.  That's easy.  That's easy, man.  Hopefully, they don't find any worms or hissing cockroaches or anything.  Well, a lot of people I read about, I don't even know.  I went through well over 1,000 emails before the show today, real fast.  You guys, if you send an email, you've got to make it short, because we're just scanning through these now. 
[01:28:30]  And a lot of people want us to do the, you know, 55-gallon challenge, too.  I don't know if any ladies out there are going to be brave enough to do this again.  We're not going to do it anytime soon, but maybe three, four, five months down the road, we might.  We already came up with sicker things to throw in the barrel, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Sicker things.  Hey, Tony, who was in the studio, says, yeah, that you were really pissed.  Yeah, let's go to Captain Anthony. 
[01:29:00]  Yo, ONA.  What's up?  Are you a cop?  That's why we're calling you Captain Anthony.  No, he's Captain Anthony from the boat.  Yeah, I'm the chum guy.  Oh, you're the chum guy.  How are you?  Yeah, I'm the chum guy.  Listen, I was standing next to John the whole time, and he was saying, oh, man, I can't believe  I did this.  And, you know, some of the obnoxious idiots.  And I was kind of telling John, I'm like, John, don't worry about it.  It'll be over in like an hour or two.  And, like, we'll laugh about it when it's all done and everything.  He's like, man, I want to kill him.  And especially that Joey Soprano guy.  Yeah.  John ain't the only one who wanted to kill him. 
[01:29:30]  He is annoying.  He's getting out of the studio.  So I'm telling you, everybody's like, who is that guy?  And he's walking around doing his whole bit.  But, guys, if you have another competition, am I invited?  Yes, of course.  We need the chum again.  That was disgusting, man.  That stuff stunk to high hell.  Guess what?  I left it there, too.  I know you did.  I wanted to sneak out of there and just get, I'm like, to my pal.  Ben, grab my mic, because we know you left the chum here, because Ben was cleaning up either Friday or today, and he ran into it, almost puked. 
[01:30:00]  I'm like, let's get out of here.  I don't want to put that stuff back in my car before we go home.  I got plenty of it.  And I just, like, left it there.  But I just wanted to tell you guys, I had a great time.  And, you know, it was awesome.  You guys, I mean, people don't realize it, but you guys are really nice, and I had a great time, man.  I just wanted to tell you that.  Don't let that out.  All right, thank you.  No, I did feel bad.  The other girls, I drove a couple of the girls home.  Yeah.  And, like, Wendy and stuff, I drove them to their cars and stuff. 
[01:30:30]  Wendy's fine.  And they were like, all right, but they were like, oh, I'm going to have nightmares and stuff like that.  Well, we found out from John, Tabitha's husband, that Tabitha did indeed have nightmares.  Oh, yeah.  They were, like, still shaking a little bit.  Yeah.  Like, I brought them in the car.  I'm like, are you guys all right?  And they're like, well, you know, I mean.  Well, we hear some of the screams from them.  Yeah.  I mean, they are authentic, horrible screams.  We have audio from Wendy.  I don't know if we're going to get to it today because we're real busy today.  But when we threw the cockroaches into Wendy's barrel, there are screams that are unfreaking  believable. 
[01:31:00]  She even told me, she's like, I freak.  Yeah.  She's like, I totally freaked out.  The chum, the fish, but the bugs, they freak.  Hey, John, you still on the line?  Yeah, man.  Oh, okay.  John, what's up?  Hey, Anthony, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, man.  Nothing.  Nothing.  We're going to get together.  We're going to have a video party and check it out again.  All right, man.  Well, thank you.  All right, yo.  All right, John.  All right, let's go ahead.  That old gag.  Hey, next show, Joe Soprano in a 55-gallon drum.  Yeah.  We're inviting all the girls down and the husband and boyfriends and whoever else wants. 
[01:31:30]  Tony was also in the studio Friday.  Tony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Good.  That was my buddy, Anthony, who just talked.  I was there with him.  Oh, okay.  I realized he was calling in, too.  I'm on the way to work in the Bronx right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, John, he got pissed.  At first, it was all funny.  He was laughing.  He was videotaping.  And they forgot to say, by the way, too, even though he was pissed, he was videotaping  the whole time.  Uh-huh.  He never stopped.  And I just turned to him like, dude, what's the matter? 
[01:32:00]  He's like, this is ridiculous.  Yeah.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I saw him pacing around.  And when I walked out of the studio once, he looked like he was cursing under his breath  or something.  Oh, he was so mad.  He was really mad.  And the guy he was talking about with the flip-up glasses was Joe Soprano.  No, no, John, you're on the line.  That guy is a lunatic.  He's a lunatic.  Joe getting some raves here today.  He's insane.  Yeah, and at the end, when they came out of the drums, I grabbed the video camera from  John, and I'm like, go help your wife out. 
[01:32:30]  And he just, he started to, and then I don't know if he was so mad he thought he was going  to start swinging at guys.  There was a couple reasons why John was mad.  First of all, everyone's abusing his wife in the barrel.  Like John mentioned, a lot of listeners, not even people associated with the show.  And then also, everyone is talking about how hot John's wife was in front of him.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was, it was all fun and games, and then all of a sudden, he just got a little  mad.  All right.  But he was laughing at the end, too.  He was laughing again at the end.  All right.  Well, Tony, thank you.  And John, I guess we're going to let you go. 
[01:33:00]  Tell Tabitha we said hi, okay?  We certainly will.  All right.  Bye.  There they go.  All right, fellas.  There they go.  We might as well play another clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge from Friday.  Yeah.  We got some interesting clips that we're going to get to either later today or early tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  All right, but here's another clip.  Kind of still early on in the festivities.  It's pretty good stuff.  Oh, Wendy's calling in from Friday, too.  Oh, yeah.  We'll talk to her next.  Stay there.  Train wreck rings.  What's that, Dave?  What's that, Dave?

The old fraud from the Sopranos died dead today. 
[01:35:00]  She died on her birthday, right?  Oh.  Makes a very organized-looking tombstone, though, doesn't it?  You ever do that when you walk into the cemetery?  You're like, oh, look at that, one day.  Died on your birthday.  Okay.  When's, uh, when's my birthday?  Yeah.  Oh, Mr. Evans, I'm sorry.  I thought you were going to be 78 in July. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Turns out you're going to be, um, 68.  Uh, when?  July?  No, you're going to be 60.  60?  What crock of crap is that?  Big 6-0 for you.  I, uh, I gotta be older than 60.  Come on, baby.  When is my birthday?  Hey, you damn kids and this music.  I think we're the youngest jocks in this whole city, man.  I started looking at some of the ages of these guys on the radio. 
[01:36:00]  God dang.  God dang.  When am I, uh, July?  My birthday?  When is it?  July, uh, 27th, around there.  Maybe if I, uh, die on my birthday.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll make a nice organized tombstone for me, baby.  I don't know.  Baby.  I don't understand why they didn't, uh, kill off the old broad at the end of the season.  They knew she was going.  They should have wrote into the storyline.  Aw.  That's kind of awful for her.  Hey, we're going to write you off because she'll probably be dead by next year.  What are they going to do now?  Make believe she moved to, uh, another city? 
[01:36:30]  No, they'll probably just make like she died.  You know?  Because she dead.  You know?  Yeah.  They'll, like, come back the next season and be like people going, hey, sorry about your mother.  Hey, F-ha.  That's C.  That was a, that was a pretty big storyline for the Sopranos, though.  We'll see what they end up doing.  Well, Anthony, let's talk to Wendy, another contestant from Friday's 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes.  Wendy, I don't care what, uh, John says about Tabitha.  Tabitha's husband, John, was on the show about ten minutes ago. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  That Tabitha had a really tough time with the whole 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Wendy was off the hook how freaked out she was on Friday.  Mm-hmm.  We were convinced she was going to quit, and she, she made it barely through the whole thing.  Yeah, you were freaking the F out.  Oh, my God.  I heard screams coming out of your barrel worse than any of the other girls.  You were authentically petrified.  You were doing that, whee, kind of scream. 
[01:37:30]  You really got the impression of what it must sound like when you're a serial killer,  and you have a girl in the barrel, like in your basement, and you're just ready to kill her.  That has to be the exact sound that they make.  That's why it was very disturbing of Friday.  And, uh, actually, um, we've had that confirmed by, uh, what's-his-facey there, uh, Big Kevin.  Big Kev confirmed that that is indeed the sound they make right before he hacks them into little pieces.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told. 
[01:38:00]  He was a little too good with, uh, putting the girls in the barrels.  And doing exactly what to do.  And duct tape in the barrels and all sorts of stuff.  So he slapped that down and had that latch on quicker than they could, uh, get out.  Wendy?  Yeah.  So, uh, now it's Monday.  It's three days after the, uh, the 55-gallon drum challenge.  How are you feeling today?  Oh, my God.  You guys have no idea how scared I was when I got home.  I was having nightmares.  Really?  I was shaking.  And you guys can sit here and tell me that those bugs didn't bite.  Let me tell you, I have bite marks all over me. 
[01:38:30]  And telling you, I must have been allergic to something because I have a rash on my arms.  I am a mess.  How about some hygiene?  Right.  No.  Let me tell you, you know how many times I had a shower?  It was disgusting.  I still smell it in my hair.  How many showers?  Huh?  How many showers?  Let me tell you, I'm taking like three showers a day.  Really?  Because I just, I feel like I still feel it on me.  It's disgusting.  Really?  But, you know, it was awesome.  I had such an awesome time.  You guys are the best. 
[01:39:00]  I love you guys.  But it was just...  She loves it.  I did.  I had so much fun.  You guys were so nice.  And, well, I can't omit that on the air, but you guys are the greats.  The what?  Pussy!  What did he say?  Pussy!  What are you guys saying?  Pussy!  You guys are so mean.  What are you guys doing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  I asked a simple question. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, you guys are horrible.  I can hear it.  I can hear it.  Yeah.  Everything's clean.  Let's just put it that way.  Everything's working out?  Oh, dang.  But you're still smelling it?  No.  No?  I just feel, I don't know.  It was all over me.  Yeah.  No, you're cursing.  I'm sorry.  I had a dump out.  Yeah, you were the one that was cursing the whole time in the barrel, too.  I was terrible.  I was inside.  You're a little dirty mouth, aren't you? 
[01:40:00]  You're going to have to shove a fish in your mouth.  I don't know if you guys noticed, but I was shaking and crying in the barrel.  But I just wanted to make sure that I got through it.  See, I felt bad because I was ready to say, you know what?  We have to get Wendy out.  But then I'm thinking she's going to get really pissed that she doesn't get the money.  Yeah.  No, I told myself that I was going to do it.  And I had to prove to everybody that said I wasn't going to do it.  I had to prove them wrong.  Rick's getting the clips together.  Maybe later today or early tomorrow on the show, we're going to play the audio of you 
[01:40:30]  just freaking the ass out all the way through.  The bugs in and the cockroaches.  Yeah, the bugs, you really started screaming.  That was hard.  Well, let me tell you, I had my ears closed when you guys were telling me that it was like  those big beetles or cockroaches.  No, it was hissing cockroaches.  I couldn't hear.  I just closed my ears and just said, whatever it is, just dump them on me and hope they  die in the water.  The noise you made, you started slapping the sludge water. 
[01:41:00]  You started banging the sides of the barrel.  Oh, it was horrible.  At that point, I was rooting for you.  I'm like, oh my God, don't bail now.  Don't bail now.  Well, one was just latching right onto me.  Right.  It just was right on my side.  It wouldn't let go of me.  And that's when I started freaking out.  But thanks, guys.  So you had a few nightmares.  You've been showering like crazy ever since Friday.  Yeah.  But you had a good time?  No, I had a good time.  The nightmares are over, thank God.  As of Saturday, no more nightmares.  But it's all right.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  It's better.  All right.  I don't know if I'd do it again, but, you know.  I don't think any of you girls will do it again.  It was hard.  We're already planning, you know, the second one.  So can I be the one that dumps the stuff on this time?  That's not a bad idea.  Get the girls back to actually do the dumping next time.  Definitely.  We're thinking of going much sicker in the next one.  Yeah, it's going to be really bad.  That's all we can say right now.  Much sicker.  Ah.  So someone's going to try to take our title.  55-gallon drum, the sequel.  The sequel's always got to be worse. 
[01:42:00]  Well, I've got to be invited back.  Ah, you will.  You're a hero now.  Everyone's checking out these pictures on the Internet.  Oh, those pictures are horrible.  What do you expect?  What do you expect?  Yeah, I know.  All that crap on me.  The before picture of you in the baby doll dress is nice.  Oh, thank you.  But coming out of the barrel is a different story.  Yeah.  You can see the bugs on you and everything.  Yeah, the worms.  I got into work and all these pictures were, like, sitting near me because everyone made  sure that they printed them out in the book before, after, everything.  It's crazy. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  You guys are now stars.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah?  All right.  And the smell never really got to you in the barrel?  It just goes away after a while.  You're so used to it.  That's not really what you're thinking about.  After a while, like, you don't even smell it.  You just know the bugs are coming.  I agree with her to a certain extent because, I mean, we obviously weren't smelling the same  thing you were inside the barrel.  Yeah.  But this studio reeked to the point where we were getting nauseous.  And then all of a sudden, it seemed to go away if you stayed in there.  Yeah.  But as soon as you left the studio and took a break, came back, like, five minutes later, 
[01:43:00]  it was like, oh, my God.  It was really bad.  It was so bad.  You guys had to get up and leave and then come back so you guys know what the difference  is.  Right.  Us, we were just stuck in there and not a lot of holes there to breathe.  So, there's stuff with this outfit.  Yeah, all your faces right in front of the holes and stuff were pretty funny.  All your girls had your noses poked through the holes trying to get some fresh air.  All I saw when I was sitting there is everybody turning their butt around.  And all I kept thinking is, please don't fart in front of me.  That's all I kept thinking.  Oh, that's right.  We never did that.  No, we were supposed to do some. 
[01:43:30]  No one ever fart.  Why?  Would you have freaked out if someone farted?  No, I covered the holes a couple of times because I don't know who it was, but a big  guy was standing right in front of my barrel and I was just waiting for him to rip one.  Oh, that would be Big Kev.  Big Kev.  Oh, wow.  That would have knocked the barrel over.  You're lucky we didn't, you know, take his jeans off him and make soup in your barrel.  Well, I saw you guys opening the beans and that's what I thought was going to happen.  I thought that's what you guys were doing.  Yeah.  All right.  But you made it.  The sour cream, meaning cream that was soured for eight hours on the heaters. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, it smelled really bad.  That really didn't affect me.  As soon as we opened the container, the smell in the studio.  My God.  You know what?  I didn't even smell that.  All right, Wendy.  We got some great audio clips of you.  Great.  Well, thanks for playing.  I'm glad everything is okay.  I'm glad the nightmares are going away slowly but surely.  Well, thank you guys.  All right, Wendy.  All right.  We'll talk to you soon.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes, Wendy.  That was great.  On the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[01:44:30]  I believe we have a clip of her standing by here where we started throwing in the fish  guts and the whole fishes and clams and squid.  We called it the Popeye surprise, I believe.  She freaked out the best.  Yeah.  She really did.  She's freaking out pretty good here.  But later on, when we play the clutch when the bugs were thrown in Wendy's barrel, you're  not going to believe the sound.  If you're Mr. Friday, you've got to stick around.  It's sick.  Opie and Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.

That's right, guys.  We're down here with our genius intern, Dave, in the WOW band. 
[01:47:00]  And we're handing out stickers right to the south side of Washington Square Park.  Just look for the O&A WOW van, right?  Yep.  It was funny.  We pulled up and all the homeless guys come running up.  Hey, man, you got T-shirts?  Do you got any heads?  Hey, hey, hey.  How long are you going to be there, man?  We'll probably be here for a good half hour, 45 minutes.  So we'll be here in the neighborhood.  All right.  We'll be down here right at the south side of Washington Square Park.  Very good.  On the way back to the station, try to run over some of those damn cows, will you?  Oh, dude, I'm going to grab a rope and tie one to the back of the goddamn pan. 
[01:47:30]  We'll drag it down.  Yeah, rope.  We'll have to hug it.  All right.  Thank you, Psycho Mark.  Bye, guys.  He's live in Washington Square Park.  That's what I was doing when I fell off destiny, trying to rope one of those goddamn cows that are all around Manhattan.  It's artwork, baby.  Is that what it is?  I don't know what it is.  I don't get the cow thing.  There's a couple outside our building.  Some outside the building.  We want to do some cow tipping, but I think they would shatter into a million pieces.  Yeah, they're life-size cows all over Manhattan, and they're decorated sort of to whatever building they're in front of. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, like the one in front of Hooters.  Has a little Hooters shirt on.  It's wearing Hooters shirts, and it's got like big, you notice that one's got like big udders?  Yeah.  No joke.  It really does.  And it's wearing like a Hooters outfit.  I don't know what it is.  There's cows all over Manhattan.  Yeah.  Don't even call in.  We don't care why the cows are all over Manhattan.  Yeah, we don't care.  I don't even want to hear it.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Anna Kornikova doing an endorsement for a bra company. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  She show herself in just a bra?  I don't know what they're doing, but the slug line, you know, like Nike just do it or whatever.  Yeah.  For this new bra company.  Is TF?  No.  No.  In the ads, it says the only thing that should be bouncing on the court is the balls.  Wow.  Ba-dum-pum.  Ah.  I don't know.  And she's claiming her game is much better now that her boobies are tight to her body and not bouncing around on the court. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, really?  She straps them down?  Yeah.  Like that?  And she could play better?  Yes.  What's Wimbledon coming up, I guess?  Is that the one coming up?  I know the U.S. opens in September or late August.  I usually don't care, but Anna's always pretty fun to watch.  As long as she wears those skimpy little shorts or those skimpy little skirts.  She tucks the ball in her underwear.  You see that? 
[01:49:30]  She goes reaching down her panties for the ball.  You see the ball boy come running out and sniff the ball that time?  I saw that.  You're a twisted F, man.  Rick, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  I was in Chicago a couple of weeks ago on business, and I saw those stupid cows up and  down the street.  I got so pissed off where I got on my plane, I grabbed a black magic marker, and like on  two or three of them, I just started writing O&A, wow, like everywhere.  Yeah.  I think I left my mark on Chicago. 
[01:50:00]  I don't know.  We were thinking of putting some wow stickers on them, but...  Absolutely.  Got to put some wow stickers on them stupid cows.  They're like all over the place.  Can we have anything better to do in this town than to put cows all over the city?  I don't know.  We've got enough cows in the city, as is.  We've got Hillary out there.  Throwing some wow stickers on her.  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  Thanks, buddy.  Bye.  Bye.  Shaft, number one at the box office this weekend, Anthony?  Shaft.  I'm amazed.  I'm amazed anyone was able to even watch the movie. 
[01:50:30]  Anybody have a problem at the movie theater to see Shaft?  With people yelling at the screen?  Being loud?  Anyone?  Spaz?  You saw it?  Spaz saw Shaft, right.  Did you have a problem in the theater with people talking?  No, but I was...  Well, me and Erica were the only two white people in the theater.  You were?  Yeah.  In Slotsburg?  No, we actually...  We went to Palisades.  Right.  And we were the only two in the theater, and the promos were all about African-American movies, 
[01:51:00]  too, that are upcoming, and there's a lot of talking.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like a lot of women saying, there go my boy, there go my boy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow, just like my problem that I had.  So you were able to watch Shaft, though?  Did they stop talking?  No.  No?  No.  So it was very loud.  Very loud, and a lot of kicking of the seats whenever the shooting occurred.  They would just kick my seat from behind, and...  Were they shooting Whitey? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, there was a lot of that in the film.  Was it a good film?  I thought it was good.  Yeah.  It was more of a comedy than an action.  How many brains do you give it?  I don't have any to give.  Spaz gives it three brains.  Out of four.  Did you ever feel that you were in danger of losing your life at any moment?  Yes, right before the beginning of the film, when I turned around to give this big, huge  African-American and evil look for kicking my seat so many times.  Oh, good moves, Spaz. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  And all Erica kept on telling me was, remember what Anthony went through.  Right.  You don't want to put him in battle mode.  No.  Very good.  So then you just, you were quiet, and they continued kicking your seat.  Yeah, for the first half of the film, and the big, fat woman in front of me just would  not shut up.  Yeah, kept yelling?  Yeah, like, oh, I would love Samuel L. Jackson to do this to me and do that to me.  Oh, boy.  Why do you guys bother even going to those, just the movies in general on the weekend?  Yeah, Shaft must have been a tough one to see, man. 
[01:52:30]  A lot of, a lot of the brothers going to see Shaft, and you know, I hate to perpetuate  a stereotype, but they are very, very boisterous at the movie.  It's very difficult to watch a movie with blacks or Hispanics in the movie theater.  Billy, that's, I'm going on record as saying.  Billy, what's going on?  Hey, guys, I saw Shaft this weekend, I had a real problem watching the movie.  Yeah?  Every time Samuel L. Jackson shot someone, they'd, oh, get out of here! 
[01:53:00]  Oh, it was bad.  It was bad, guys.  All right, Billy.  All right.  Thank you.  Yep.  Jesus.  Let's go to Mark on line 11.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Great.  I saw it at the Palisade Center also, like Spaz did.  Yeah?  A little boisterous.  Let's just leave it at that.  A little loud?  Just a little.  Kind of hard seeing it?  Oh, every time.  It's like, ooh, ooh.  It's like, the girl is going, ooh, wee, and all the guys are like, uh-huh.  And over and over.  Oh, boy.  Was it a good movie, Mark?  I couldn't tell. 
[01:53:30]  You know, I was more distracted than anything.  Yeah, at some point, it's hard to pay attention to the movie when you're feeling that your life  is in danger or you really can't listen to the movie.  I'll tell you, in this case, I didn't feel so threatened as I did just annoyed.  Yeah, it gets really annoying because you've got to sit there.  You can't say anything.  Yeah, exactly.  That's right.  So you just sit and you spent your money.  You wasted it.  And my wife and I have an eight-month-old daughter.  So we've almost, we've seen, this is the first movie we've seen since the baby was born.  Because we live, my parents were up in Rockland.  That's what we were doing there. 
[01:54:00]  And, you know, we're like, hey, let's go see the movies.  And after that, we were like, let's just rent from now on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  Let's go to Barbie on line three.  Barbie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  How?  I just want to tell you, I went to go see you in Jersey, in Central Jersey.  Over the Week on Shaft on Friday.  Wow.  And let me tell you, we were like the only white people in the theater.  And there was a brawl that started at the beginning of the theater.  And there was some dude with a laser pointer.  And then that guy almost started another brawl. 
[01:54:30]  The frigging laser pointers.  I swear to God.  Damn, he's fun, brother.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Yeah, the women go there and just, like, drool.  They leave puddles in the seats.  Just nuts.  Butter my popcorn.  I'm doing it myself, honey.  He was fine.  He's fine, yeah.  And you're like, you're sitting there going, oh, jeez, what did he say?  He's fine.  But what did he just effing say?  And us poor white folks who are just sitting there, like, terrified.  Oh, you don't say a word.  We just sat there going.  You don't say a word. 
[01:55:00]  Pathetic.  You black people hold us hostage.  I just want to go see a good movie.  Yeah, exactly.  Black people hold us hostage in the movie theater.  It's amazing.  We just got to shut up.  Do you think the black people know?  Watch your back.  Do you think the black people know they got the power over Whitey?  Yeah, when black people are acting up, we're just not brave enough to say anything.  They know we're not going to say nothing.  Oh, you'd be crazy to say something.  Another white guy.  You'd be out of your effing mind.  They're going to turn around and bust a cap in your ass, man.  Another white guy acts up.  You have no problem confronting them.  Exactly. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  Thank you, Barbie.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  You guys got the power over us.  The power.  Yeah.  KB, what's going on?  Anthony, you never heard that Chris Rock joke?  What?  There's a difference between black people and niggas, and black people hate niggas, too.  Well, I think you're right there.  I think Chris Rock said that.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm telling you, I hate going to the movies on the weekends myself because you go through  the same thing.  It doesn't matter if you're white, black, or Hispanic, bro. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Pain in the ass.  Thank you, KB.  Later, bro.  I just knew going to see Shaft would be a little bit of a chore in my neighborhood.  You didn't want to go see Gone in 60 Seconds, Anthony?  I'll probably go see that eventually.  I don't know.  I don't want to see that.  I'll wait for rental, probably.  Nick, what's going on?  You know, Gone in 60 Seconds is a white guy at the Valley Street Theater on Sunrise Highway.  That's the deal.  I mean, here's the theater.  It's got a metal detector.  You know, it's a question of the theater. 
[01:56:30]  I mean, you know, I went out with the race issue and all you bleeding hearts out there  jumping on my man, Anthony.  It's just, it's crazy.  You know, like they said, somebody once said the only thing white in that place was the  movie screen.  They put a metal detector in there.  Do we need metal detectors at movie theaters?  Movie theaters open.  My wife and I went there, my kid was born on the first night we went out there, and it  was like, you know, somebody else, he's got a gun.  Metal detector.  The theater never leaves the ground.  It never leaves the ground, yet you need a metal detector. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Thank you very much.  Thanks for putting my life in jeopardy.  All right, Nick.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Shouldn't we feel, be able to feel safe in movie theaters?  No, you can't.  And you dare not turn around and say anything, because you will, will get your ass kicked.  Not maybe.  You turn around and go, excuse me, I'm really trying to watch this movie, and you're kind  of being loud.  You're punched.  Is this really a line from the movie?  Mike from Huntington writes, in Shaft, in one scene he pumps a shotgun and says it's 
[01:57:30]  it's Giuliani time.  Does that mean he likes the mayor?  That's pretty funny.  Phil from the city.  Who's the man that can't get a cab?  Shaft.  Damn right.  All right, let's go to James.  James, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey.  Hey, James.  Yeah, I went to the movies this weekend, too.  Yeah.  And I'm going out with a couple of my friends.  We're going to see Gone in 60 Seconds.  We're all pretty into cars, and we realize that this movie has no plot. 
[01:58:00]  All it is is stealing cars.  And I thought it was.  It's one big car crash, car chase movie, right?  Yeah.  There was no plot whatsoever in this movie.  All it was was, I'm going to steal 50 cars in one night.  Yeah, what happened to Nicolas Cage's career, man?  Yeah, we pretty much went down the toilet this past couple of years.  That 8mm movie or whatever?  Yeah.  Oof.  But when I'm there, you know, I'm going 9.30, so all the other people from my school  are, you know, been there and gone.  So I'm there with, like, the 20, 30-year-olds.  So the four of us sit down. 
[01:58:30]  The movie starts.  And six people walk in and go the row in front of us.  They finally sit down.  Halfway through the movie, cell phone goes off.  Oof.  All right.  They act like they're turning it off.  25 minutes later, rings again.  I'm like, and this is right in front of me.  Right in front of me.  And then they start talking, like, yo, I got to go.  I got to go.  All right.  They turn the phone off.  They have a two-month-old baby.  I didn't even see the kid.  Why are you taking a two-month-old baby to the goddamn movie? 
[01:59:00]  Because they'll just cry and ruin it for everyone.  And that's all they did.  And then the baby's crying.  Jesus.  And this one's rocking and back and forth.  My knees are getting, like, slammed into it.  Oh, my God.  I totally sympathize with you.  I've been there.  I just push the chair way up.  The woman with the kid is just pretty much on the floor.  And I have my knees on the back of the chair for about 40 seconds.  And you have to divvy up your time between paying attention to the movie and defending your ground.  And you totally can't get into the movie. 
[01:59:30]  At that point, you've just got to get your money back.  Just leave.  It's not going to get any better.  Then, you know, different ways they were stealing the cars.  Those were, like, you know, the newer ways and unrealistic.  And one of the people in this little group here, he's going, like, oh, my God, yo, I never tried that.  I never tried that.  He did not say that.  It was an educational film.  But it was quite a night there.  That's funny.  I want to hear from some of the brothers today, man.  This discussion is always one-sided. 
[02:00:00]  I'll talk to you guys later.  Where are the brothers today?  Why do you have to speak up at a damn movie?  We've heard.  We heard.  When we talked about this last time, they called up and said, yeah, you're right.  And I can't even go to a movie.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You guys rule.  I went to go see Shaft this weekend in central Jersey.  And it was a predominantly white theater.  There was, like, 300 white people and one black person in there.  And the black guy had kids with him.  And the kids were making all kinds of noise. 
[02:00:30]  So somebody says to the guy, why don't you take the kids outside?  And the guy stands up, only black guy in the whole theater, and he goes, why don't you  take the goddamn kid outside?  The movie theater went silent.  Nobody said anything.  Oh, boy.  I couldn't believe it.  What a bunch of bitches we are.  Whitey and Gentiles, we are bitches.  Yeah.  We're scared of the black guys when they speak up, man.  Another white guy speaks up?  I have no problem confronting them. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  One more thing, Anthony.  Ah, yeah.  Were you upset that there was pornography in your girlfriend's Barney book?  Barney.  That's an old story.  That's funny.  All right, Mike.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Let's go to Matt.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Matt, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Great.  I went to the movie this weekend.  I saw Jim Carrey's sneak preview.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I was just watching the movie with my girlfriend.  And out of nowhere, it's Sienna Kornikova.  She's in the movie?  A little cameo.  A quick cameo. 
[02:01:30]  Not bad.  Yeah, I was like, oh, my God.  She's like, what, what?  I was like, nothing.  All right, so what's the deal, man?  Me, myself, and Irene.  Good?  Bad?  Yeah, it definitely made me laugh.  Oh, good.  I can't wait to see that movie.  Yeah, it's one of his better ones.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  All right.  Guys, have fun.  We will.  We always do.  Yeah, this hit the paper today.  Actor, comedian, Jim Carrey's latest role is anything but a laughing matter to one organization.  Oh, no.  Somebody's upset.  Now they're going to try to get PC with the goddamn movies.  I'm so sick of this crap. 
[02:02:00]  What organization could be pissed off?  Me, myself, and Irene and 20th Century Fox are coming under fire from the National Mental  Health Association for apparently grossly mischaracterizing and making fun of people with schizophrenia.  What?  You got to be accurate in a comedy movie?  Don't you love that?  It's a comedy movie about somebody with some kind of schizophrenia.  And since it's not medically accurate, they're upset?  They're upset.  Oh, yeah.  Because that's what people want to see.  They want to go there and see an accurate movie. 
[02:02:30]  In the movie, Carrey plays a state trooper whose multiple personalities come together as a woman named Irene.  The National Mental Health Association points out that schizophrenia isn't linked to split or multiple personalities.  It is an illness that impairs a person's ability to think clearly and relate to others.  The association contends the movie tagline, from gentle to mental.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  Equiates mental illness with violent behavior. 
[02:03:00]  A recent study by the association found a majority of Americans felt that depictions of people with mental illness in the entertainment industry tend to be negative.  Why would...  We're doomed.  We're so doomed.  The politically correct police.  You see also, the Brits are all upset about Patriot.  Yeah.  England upset at Mel Gibson's Patriot flick.  Oh, well, get over it.  Why?  Because it shows us kicking your ass? 
[02:03:30]  Kicking your limey ass?  Limey ass?  Oh, my word.  It shows this rambunctious bunch of Americans making us look stupid and beating us and meh, meh, meh.  What do they say?  It shows the English as being cowardly and bumbling.  What else would you call somebody that walks in a straight line into gunfire?  No wonder you lost your big dopes. 
[02:04:00]  They're dressed in these suits, walking in a straight line.  We're all in red.  We're all there in the bushes, just waiting.  No, it's even worse than that.  They're in a straight line.  Who's the guy that's playing the fife?  In the front row.  Yes, yes.  And the drums in the front row.  Keep it up, then.  Play the fife in the drum, weren't you, then?  How stupid do you got to be to first of all be in the front row playing a goddamn fife?  Hold steady.  Play all fives.  Heading toward the enemy. 
[02:04:30]  Quack, quack.  It's over, Johnny.  What are they upset about?  It was a couple hundred years ago.  And we just kicked your ass.  Take the beating.  He bailed you out in World War II.  Don't worry about it.  Man.  Yes.  The British are upset because the bad guy is what they call merciless and bloodthirsty, 
[02:05:00]  and it's like, well, he's the bad guy.  He's the bad guy in a movie.  Right.  Oh, relax.  What do you think?  What do you think?  Oh, by definition of bad guy.  He would be merciless and ruthless and bloodthirsty.  Of course.  Of course.  Hey, do we have some clips from the mental people, mental association about the Jim Carrey flick?  Brits pissed because they're portrayed as evil.  And an unrelated note, 450 British soccer fans arrested this weekend in Belgium for getting into a drunken riot. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  All right, let's play the clip from the mental association.  They have a problem with me, myself, and Irene.  All right.  I haven't seen the movie, but whenever the public is given information, I think,  that makes light of mental disorders or makes a joke out of it, it perpetuates stigma.  Kimber!  Kimber!  I hate people who talk about something they haven't even seen. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  It's the stigma.  What?  As a mental patient?  Give me another clip.  Making light of the real problems that people have and their pain and their struggle is another thing.  Just in poor taste.  Shut up.  Their pain and struggle.  It's a joke, isn't it?  Jesus Christ.  What's wrong with these people? 
[02:06:30]  The public takes a word like schizo and generalizes it to a lot of negative things.  And what that does is that increases stigma for people with a mental illness.  They're considered dangerous.  They're considered crazy.  It really is not scientifically based, and that's a real concern for us.  Yeah, schizos aren't dangerous.  Hello?  Hello, right here in this fine city of ours, that loser that pushed that poor lady in front of the subway.  Yeah.  What was that guy diagnosed as schizo? 
[02:07:00]  How about the guy that beat the woman over the head with the brick?  Schizo.  Well, I'm sure all schizos aren't dangerous.  But my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, the odds.  Just look at the odds.  The odds are pretty good you're a schizo.  You're doing some pretty crazy things.  Yeah.  I'm sure there are plenty of nice schizos in the city.  I have some friends that are schizos.  I think they're stereotyping schizos, but the majority of schizos are schizo. 
[02:07:30]  All right, and Blackout wants to set the record straight on why they speak up in the movie theater.  All right.  Hey, Wes, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Listen, it's like an event when we go to the movies.  It's like when you guys go to the football game at Tailgate.  We go there, like, just for the atmosphere.  Don't you understand, my brother, that we are trying to watch the goddamn movie?  But, dog, listen, if you want to watch the movie, we're watching it in Silicon Valley or something.  In Silicon Valley.  Silicon Valley.  I got to fly all the way to California to see a movie? 
[02:08:00]  Well, I'm saying it's like an event, but listen, when we, yeah, and all y'all white people get scared, we love that.  We go outside and laugh about that.  Yeah, and we laugh when we have jobs.  So I guess it all works out in the end.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, and we go to the movies and relax.  We just gotta have a good time.  It's like an event.  Why can't you keep your mouth shut?  Yeah, come on, brother.  Help us out.  Help out a cracker.  I can't call it.  But to go to the movies and be quiet, it's like when you see something exciting, you gotta slap your man, fire him, like, oh, man, you saw that? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, because they do.  They're, like, convulsing like a king gimp in the seat.  Like, when a scene happens, they go, they're like, oh, man, wah, wah, wah, wah, and, like, their arms and legs are flailing like king gimp.  And the best thing, man, is the rocking chair.  That was the best thing I've ever heard of for the movie.  Oh, my God, the rocking chair.  Because now that rocket action, when you laugh, you're gonna rock that.  I swear to God.  You had that weird laugh, too, that. 
[02:09:00]  Like that?  Yeah.  It looks like waves going over AstroTurf when they start rocking in the chairs.  I'm the only black guy that listens to you guys, man, but you guys rule.  No, we got a lot of African-Americans.  A lot of the brothers.  A lot of the brothers.  I never got robbed.  I don't like that African-American thing, God damn it.  What if you're Jamaican, for God's sake?  It's American.  Just because somebody's black, they're African-American, that doesn't make any sense.  What if you're from Canada, for God's sake? 
[02:09:30]  What if a black guy's from Canada and he's down here?  What if he's from Canada, he comes down and he's described as an African-American?  It makes no sense because he's black?  No, he's a black guy.  We're white guys.  We're actually black.  So black is not really...  Well, then come up with a hue we can all agree on.  Because African-American isn't right.  It's not appropriate.  It doesn't work.  I thought we all had figured out when we used the word colored.  I thought it was pretty good. 
[02:10:00]  Well, it made more sense than calling a guy a black guy.  Actually, that is in the NAACP.  If you think about it, color...  The C stands for color.  Makes a little more sense than calling a guy that's light-skinned, like light brown black.  At least you're saying color.  Yeah, because you don't want to be called black.  He's light brown.  Well, what do you want to be called?  Because African-American, you've got to agree, it doesn't fit.  The guy's from Canada.  He's down here, visiting.  Hello, how you doing?  Hey, you're an African-American.  I am not.  I'm a Canadian. 
[02:10:30]  So then...  He's from really North America, so it's like...  Okay, then he's from England.  Comes over.  He's described as an African...  What if a guy from England comes over?  No one knows he's from England.  And he gets lost.  And they describe in the paper, the missing man is described as an African-American male.  It doesn't...  That isn't true.  Well, to you people, we're going to say anything anyway.  You know the joke you guys say.  What do you call a black rocket scientist?  What?  Nigga.  Oh, God damn.  That's...  Hey, I never heard that one. 
[02:11:00]  You know what I mean?  No.  Yeah, no.  Now you've got to get out of it more, man.  Heard a thousand times.  Yeah, well, listen.  I made up that joke.  Britney Spears thing with the screaming and the fire engine.  And that had me...  God, I almost crashed my car laughing at that.  At what day?  With the Britney Spears music.  Britney.  With the fire engine and the women screaming.  Oh, yeah.  That was pretty funny, yeah.  Man, that was...  It had me crying.  Right on, man.  But, Joe, man, you guys suck.  All right, cool.  All right, later.  Peace.  Quiet down in the movies.  Damn it.  It's an event, Dopey. 
[02:11:30]  That's why.  And the rocking chairs now?  You've been in the newer movie theater?  Where the chairs are really nice and they're spring-loaded and they rock?  I swear to God, I'm waiting to see flying, catapulted black people in these spring-loaded  chairs.  Because they just start...  I swear to you, it looked like King Gimp when he won the Oscar.  Like when someone, when Shaft shoots up some people or something.  Whoa!  Whoa!  They're high-fiving.  They're slapping.  The seats are rocking.  It's insane.  I just hope the afro doesn't come back.  I want to see the screen. 
[02:12:00]  Take a hedge clip with you.  Just cut a little you.  You can see.  Lou, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Are you black, too, y'all?  Yeah, yeah.  I live in a good white neighborhood and you know how the white people in my neighborhood  try to keep us out of the movie theaters?  Yeah.  They burn crosses in front of the movie theaters.  No.  Yeah, I think that's what you guys should do before you go to see the movie.  Look at you.  Burn a couple of crosses.  Yeah, because that's what we're talking about. 
[02:12:30]  No one's ever heard of anything like we're talking about.  No, I know, I know.  So a lot of black people are allowed and, you know, they should be dealt with, you know.  But what's the most confusing day in Harlem?  You're not black.  Only black people are allowed to type in the joke today.  Yeah.  I know you're white.  You're lying.  Call black shady people?  What?  That's what Tom says on line four.  All right, we should take a break.  Psycho Mark's getting paranoid.  Oh, no.  Psycho Mark in Washington Square Park handing out wow stickers for a little longer. 
[02:13:00]  Uh, Psycho Mark.  Dude, you guys are going to get me killed.  This is the fuck people walking by and you guys are going colored and afro and all that stuff.  These people are looking at the van like they're going to, like, shut it on fire.  These people?  You should be ashamed of yourself.  You're just paranoid because you're stoned.  You know what pot does.  It makes you all paranoid.  How much did you buy so far down there at the park? 
[02:13:30]  A couple keys.  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  I've got poundage in the van now.  All right, get out of here.  Hey, we got Ziggy down here.  He's helping us hand out stickers.  How's his face?  Oh, he's making my stuff.  I heard he got beat up.  Is Ziggy really down there?  Yeah, he's right here.  Where the hell did he go?  He was just here a second ago.  Ziggy from the Homeless Shopping Spring.  Dude, if you get Ziggy, we've got to get him on the air.  Yeah, I'll call you right back.  I'll call you after the break.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Ziggy from the Homeless Shopping Spring.  There's Psycho Mark, Washington Square Park.  Everyone down at Washington Square Park, we want to say hello to you, no matter if you're 
[02:14:00]  white, Asian, Puerto Rican, or those colored people.  Say hi to Psycho Mark, representative of us, Opie and Anthony.  Radio station for everyone.  Man, doesn't matter.  Come, Ogie Negroes, and get bumper stickers from Psycho Mark in Washington Square Park.  I know, he's fumbling trying to turn down the speakers.  He's just fumbling for the keys to try to start the van.  Kevin, what's going on? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, man.  I just want to let y'all know why black people act up all the time.  Whenever you see a black person trying to scare y'all, this is the reason why.  It's because the cops are always getting on them.  Oh, yeah.  So they can't do anything to the cops.  So what they do, it's like if you got a little brother, you just take it out on a little brother.  So you white guys are black people's little brother.  So it's like we're taking the brunt because of the cops?  That's right.  It's like this is society.  All right.  It's coming at you.  That's what it is.  So all the frustration that they got, they just take it out on y'all. 
[02:15:00]  Why?  You get pulled over a lot?  I used to it when I was younger, but now I'm a little older.  Yeah.  I keep my seatbelt on, try to drive straight.  There you go.  You know.  What used to happen when you got pulled over?  Was it like a problem?  Oh, it was like, you know, hold on.  This car was reported stolen and the flashlight's all up in the car and everything.  And you're like.  Well, was it?  Hell no.  Hell no.  But that's, you know, that's what, but now, you know, it's getting a little better,  but it's just more like the kids are just young now.  Yeah.  They're just a little bit younger, but that's what really, it's just this society. 
[02:15:30]  That's why y'all, y'all just getting what society's giving us.  It's society, Opie.  That's what it is.  How come I never do anything, but I have to sit in a movie theater and I can't watch the movie?  I don't know.  I try to be courteous.  I mean, white people, I mean, the police to the white people are like the Calvary.  But when a black person sees a police officer, no matter what's going on, they're worried.  You know, there are a lot of black cops, too.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  I mean, you see the police, you're thinking about, okay, something's up.  You know, you're always on your toes.  But most white people see the police, oh, wow, look at them. 
[02:16:00]  Here they go, these guys.  And white people don't think like that.  So.  Interesting.  It's a messed up way of thinking, but that's the way it is, so.  So, in return, you're allowed in the movies.  Okay.  Basically, and then, you know.  Now it makes perfect sense.  And then when you see somebody and you're like, you have to get the Mac machine and then  the person, you know, a black person gets out and they got a Mac card in their hand and  you see a white person in there and then they want to run around.  They want to run back to their car and throw the alarm on real quick and jump in and lock  the doors and pull off, run over the curve and everything.  Stuff like that.  You know, it's just BS. 
[02:16:30]  It's you got to always see every day.  You guys freak us out.  I'm telling you, white people are so nervous.  It's crazy.  You get so nervous.  Why do you think that is?  Especially when there's a group of you.  Forget about it.  Why do you think that is?  I just think it's just a whole combination of everything.  It's not really, you know, it's messed up.  I hope it changes because, you know.  It'll never change.  We're doomed as a society and somewhere down the road there's going to be like a huge  civil war.  There's going to be an explosion and hopefully we'll just all fail.  It's the only way it's ever going to be and then I guess we'll all get along once  the three of us on each side left will have to shake hands at some point. 
[02:17:00]  You got no house, I got no house.  We're going to have to do something.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, you want to help me build something out of this rubble?  Yeah, let's take all this bullcrapper guy and just make it.  No one will all go.  Okay, I'll go do something.  You build the house.  Yeah.  Yeah, take my wife if she's paying to me in the next door.  Jesus.  Come on, I'm kidding.  Ah, Jesus.  We're all going to get along when we're all the same color.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, when we're all nice tan. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  We're all lightly tan.  We'll all get along.  That could take another few thousand years, though.  So white people, just be easy.  If you see a black person, nine out of ten times they are right.  That's the tenth one you've got to watch out for.  Watch out for that.  I'm too busy throwing the locks down on my door and speeding.  Are you one of the guys that pull off over the curb at the Mac machine?  Uh, yeah.  No.  What are you?  My door is automatically locked when I leave, so I don't have to.  Do you ever walk past the car and you just hear, do, do, do, do?  Oh, man. 
[02:18:00]  Down the sidewalk.  I mean, I walk down the sidewalk.  I have, like, papers in my hand.  You know what?  All you have to do as a black guy to scare the living crap out of a white person is start  walking toward their door of their car.  Just like if you're crossing the street and you would normally cross between two cars,  just start walking toward the door and then veer off and cross the street.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  You will see a white person have an effing heart attack.  I swear to God, you'll just see panic in their face.  They might even hit the car in front of them trying to peel out. 
[02:18:30]  And I hate to admit, I drove in today, got off at Van Damme.  Yeah.  As soon as I made that right, I locked my doors.  Nah.  See?  It's sad, but it's just instinct or something.  I don't know.  You don't even have to worry about that, because if a black person even comes at you, you're  going to get a duck penalty or something.  So, I mean, if they scratch your car, they're going to get, like, 20 years.  Oh, yeah.  And if they punch you in the head, they'll get 50.  And then if they kill you, you're going to definitely go to get, they're going to die.  Oh, no.  All right, Kev, you got a joke for us today? 
[02:19:00]  Let me see.  Is that the penalty when they poke your eardrums out?  The death penalty?  They make you death, right?  Jesus.  Oh, oh, okay.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.  Kev, give us a joke.  You know, one of those jokes.  Yeah, give us a joke about Whitey.  A Whitey joke?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man.  That's like you've never told a Whitey joke.  That's what I find really funny about you guys. 
[02:19:30]  You guys.  We can joke about you, but you guys aren't joking about us behind our backs.  I'm telling you, it's not even that deep.  It's not.  Come on.  We don't care.  We got other stuff to really worry about.  We just laugh at, like, a certain situation.  They can't be making jokes.  It's not like we sit around and say, hey, did you see that White guy, the way he ran across  the street when I came up?  I don't like that.  Why'd the White man cross the road?  To go to his job.  God damn, that's funny. 
[02:20:00]  Nah, see?  That's a stereotype.  Yeah.  That's what, you know.  We'll get better, I hope, but, you know.  Not in our lifetime, my friend.  You're doomed as a nation.  Yeah, probably.  Hey, Kev, you all right, man?  Yeah, y'all guys are all right, too, man.  I listen to you every day.  So, you know, like I say, white people, just be easy.  It's a lot of good people out there.  Yeah, well, just shut up in the movie theaters.  Well, I don't know about all that.  You're not going to get that.  You better off the...  You guys need to speak up a little more on this show. 
[02:20:30]  Well, we're going to start to get through, especially with...  We like hearing the other side.  It's hard to get through, especially with Spaz.  I know, he starts talking like he's jived.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, especially with Spaz on the line, Mr. KKK himself.  He can forget it.  Yeah, he won't put you through.  Kev, teach me some black slang.  What, some black slang?  Yeah, I need some new stuff.  Because I wore out the other stuff.  Something good and hip and in.  All right, some new stuff.  Man, you got me clowning already.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  Something that's sweet now, instead of saying sweet or fresh, you just say it's hot.  It's hot?  It came back to hot again?  Yeah, it's hot.  It's blazing.  Whitey had that a few years ago.  You just took it.  No, they never had it.  No, I got hot.  Man, that's neat, man.  Neat.  Terrific, man.  It's all right, dude.  That's really funny.  I need something new, man.  Matter of fact, the note book I'm reading on the train these days.  What?  I swear to God, I want to be black so bad.  I don't know why.  I'm reading.  You only work four hours a day as it is, though. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, come on.  Why can't I just joke?  We're having fun.  I'm reading pimp on the train.  Pimp?  Yeah.  Mike D. Nicola gave me this book for my birthday, Pimp.  And it's about pimps?  Yeah.  And being a pimp?  Yeah.  And there's a lot of slang in there.  There's one where they go, man, you're sleeping.  Oh, yeah, sleeping.  Like, that's what they would call spaz.  Like, man, you're sleeping.  You're not sleeping.  Sleeping is one if you don't know something.  It's like if you're ignorant to a spaz.  That's spaz.  That's what I mean. 
[02:22:00]  That's what I mean.  He's just ignorant.  You're sleeping.  Man, spaz, you're in a coma.  Spaz is dead.  Spaz is dead on arrival.  He's just dead on that.  Yeah.  All right, Kev.  All right, y'all.  Take care.  All right, man.  Thank you.  There he goes.  All right.  And let's take a break here.  Erky-durky.  Oh, you know what?  We've had a few requests for this.  Yeah, let's get this out of the way here.  Remember our old boss?  I don't want anyone to confuse this next bit for our new boss. 
[02:22:30]  Da-da-dickweed?  Da-da-dickweed, yes.  Can you say dickweed on the radio?  You can say dickweed.  That's an actual piece of vegetation.  Maybe I can't say that.  Yeah, you can.  Yeah, dickweed.  We had the biggest loser of a PD up in Boston.  Yeah.  He's still a loser.  I mean, he would always call us in the middle of our show telling us, you know, you better  not do that.  You better not do this.  Anything that was funny or entertaining in the least bit, he would call up, maybe we  should calm down on that. 
[02:23:00]  Right.  Okay, we'll just do a show that sucks and then get thrown off.  Right.  So there's a famous bit from the O&A archives called Da-da-Dave.  It's our old boss calling us in the middle of us just having this break on, I don't know,  gay people or I forget.  It was the old Volkswagen.  Oh, yeah, that's what it was.  Two gay guys driving in the Volkswagen.  Da-da-da.  Remember that one?  Right, right.  We were goofing on and he thought we were being a little insensitive to the gay issues and  thought we should stop it. 
[02:23:30]  Well, we went on the radio and said, you know, it was a gay couple.  You know, so that we really weren't even doing anything that bad.  This guy was so frigging, like, uptight.  He had a big stick up his ass and he would always give us crap about everything we did.  Oh, God, we can't stand this guy.  So the hotline rang while we're in commercials and he's trying to convince us to stay away  from the gay zone or you're entering the gay zone.  Yeah.  Whatever that means.  Talking about gay issues.  We're, you know, we should steer clear of the gay zone. 
[02:24:00]  And we just completely told on him.  This is Da-da-Dave.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of  hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads. 
[02:24:30]  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky, licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun.  But you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  Hold on.  We've got to break in.  What he's doing there is reciting some of our bit.  So when he says it out of contact, it's pretty damn funny.  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  Licky, licky.  He's like, he's reciting what we just said during the bit.  Hokey, pokey in the butt. 
[02:25:00]  And you are such as smart as...  Opie really...  Like, we both couldn't stand the guy, but Opie was more vocal about it.  So, you were just sitting there disgusted.  No, it's funny stuff.  Right.  Like, F you.  Right.  Such a smart ass, man.  I just didn't care.  I thought, Dave.  All right.  So, yeah, we should have set it up and say, you know, he starts reciting some of the lines  from this gay bit we were doing.  It's really funny.  And he had no clue we were recording his entire phone call.  All right.  We're going to start it over.  Here we go.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line? 
[02:25:30]  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads.  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky, licky.  That's fun stuff. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, it's fun.  But you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See you.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello.  Going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay, gay, gay zone. 
[02:26:30]  Wanted to, you know, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Uh-huh.  Gays, gays, gays, all, you know, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Huh.  Licky, licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick, lick.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  The old dirt road.  Licky, licky, licky, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Going into the gay zone.  Yeah.  Going into the gay zone.  Not really.  Going into the gay, gay, gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, pokey, pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.

Wicky, wicky, yeah, it's fun.  Licky, wicky, yeah, it's fun.  Pokey, pokey in the butt?  Not really.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.

[02:29:00]  W-A-W.  New New York.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Half cut the book.  Yeah, I know.  He broke that.  Still a day.  What's going on?  Uh.  A lot of people have comments about the 55-gallon drug challenge, Anthony.  On line 11 is Doug.  Who's having nightmares over the show.  Doug, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Oh, you're 12. 
[02:29:30]  No, I'm 15.  Oh, 15.  Yeah.  What happened to the voice?  Didn't quite change over yet, huh?  You got the, you got hair on the sack yet?  Yeah, uh, Friday night.  Friday night, I had a nightmare that I was in one of the drums.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And a priest was molesting you?  No.  Um.  Yeah, I had this nightmare that I was in one of the drums, and all of a sudden, all the  cockroaches, the hissing cockroaches got poured in.  And they were crowing all over me.  Really? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, my brother, Andrew, he told me that I woke up and I was screaming that they were  all over me.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Great.  Okay.  Good luck with that voice.  Thanks.  When it's time to change.  She's probably got friends.  You know, you got friends that, like, talk like this and stuff.  Hey, what's up?  Are you the last one to change in your class?  No.  Does your voice crack yet?  No, it's just I'm sick, so my voice doesn't sound right.  Do you get that funny feeling during English class?  Do you have that one, like, uh, that one hair sprouting from your chin? 
[02:30:30]  No, it doesn't sound like anything.  You've got anything like that going on.  Do people, uh, when you answer the phone, think you're a girl?  No.  Yeah, they do.  No, they don't.  No?  No.  All right.  Well, thanks, Doug.  Thanks.  Thanks for listening.  Thanks.  Got your wow sticker on your locker?  Okay.  Real funny. 
[02:31:00]  All right, Doug.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Why don't we talk to one of the contestants from the 55-Gallon Drum Challenge, Anthony?  We've heard from Tabitha so far and Wendy.  Yes.  And now we're talking to Kate.  Kate, how are you today?  Hey, guys.  Good.  How about you?  Sorry to make you wait so long.  That's all right.  All right.  I'm doing much better than I was Friday.  Yeah.  I've got to say, you girls were very freaked out.  Yeah.  After the show on Friday.  Oh, yeah.  We had to go off the air, but it started, you know, settling in what you were through. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  So how was your weekend?  It was good.  Actually, Friday night, I think I was still in shock.  I just, like, passed out because my joints were so achy from being in that drum for so long.  I was like, my knees.  Yeah.  Kate, by the way, was one of the two girls to get out of the drum before.  Yeah, before the end.  And thank God I did.  Oh, my God.  The hissing cockroaches, no way.  Yeah.  No way.  Now, what got to you?  Was it the crickets jumping all over your body or the mealworms? 
[02:32:00]  I forget now.  It was the worms.  Like, I saw them above me before they were going to put them in.  And I was like, that's it?  You know, I couldn't see.  Yeah.  You know?  Now, what was the worst part about being in the drum, Friday?  The chum.  The chum?  That was the most disgusting, most heinous smell.  I can't believe, does the studio still smell?  No.  No.  No?  The cop came in and laid that stuff down.  It was pretty good.  Yeah.  They laid the stuff down that they put on, what, bodies that are...  Oh, okay. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, they put it on dead bodies?  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  When they go into, like, you know, an apartment or something and there's been a body there for  a week or two and it's starting to really reek, they throw this stuff down and it neutralizes  the smell and it neutralized our studio pretty well after you guys left.  Oh, so that's good.  Yeah, because that's...  I mean, I was in Point Pleasant this weekend and I just got, like, a fish smell while I was  walking.  I was like...  I wanted to throw up.  I was like, don't even remind me of that.  Memories.  Yeah.  Oh, never again. 
[02:33:00]  That's for sure.  I'm so glad one of you have finally admitted that the fish chum was the worst thing because  that was just...  I mean, they took the lid off the fish chum and we were losing it.  Yeah, I felt so bad and Rick got sick, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too funny.  Oh, my God.  You had the fish thrown in on you, right?  Oh, yeah.  I had the little friend in there with me.  Yeah, and the squid?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I didn't even see it until, like, I looked at the pictures on your site and I was just  like... 
[02:33:30]  On Saturday, I was looking at them.  I was like, I can't believe I did that.  But you're glad you didn't get the bugs, though, right?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I mean, especially the hissing cockroaches.  Man.  Those things were like...  They're like animals.  Let me tell you something.  No, let me tell you something.  I mean, we had 30 or 40 guys hanging out, checking out the show Friday and a lot of the  guys were freaked out just checking them out while they were still in the container.  Right.  And throw them into a dark barrel with everything you guys were through before that.  That's crazy. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  How many showers did you take since Friday?  Probably about 10.  I showered as soon as I got home and then I showered again that night and then eventually...  Wow, yeah.  Did the honey or the syrup come out of your hair or...?  It did.  You know what was stuck in my hair was that kitty litter.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was nasty.  We almost had a...  We got to say this because we almost had a disaster with the kitty litter.  Yeah, we realized we almost killed you, broads.  Yeah, that's right.  We put kitty litter in the barrels as one of the first things, pretty much. 
[02:34:30]  It was just a dust storm and the girls, we got to find the audio of that.  They start hacking all at the same time and they can't catch their breath.  And Ann and I look at each other like, oh, my God.  Uh-oh, we screwed up this time.  We screwed up really bad.  Like if one of them had asthma or something, they'd have been dead in that barrel.  At least we had the holes to breathe out of.  Yeah, we got to get that clip because it's kind of funny, to be honest with you.  The five girls just all hacking at the same time.  And then we finally gave you the goggles that we forgot about.  Yeah, those were definitely key. 
[02:35:00]  We're such losers, man.  We're saints.  And Rick was so good.  He was like giving us water and stuff.  Like he would like splash us down after a while.  Yeah, I was giving you water.  Yeah, I was squirting it in the side holes.  That's called good cop, bad cop.  Rick is like, it's okay.  Everything will be okay.  And we're just slamming things into the barrel.  Well, at least you guys were nice.  It was all nice until, you know, except for the barrel part, you know.  Yeah.  Well, I'm glad you made it.  I'm glad you had a good time. 
[02:35:30]  And you guys are all like big time stars.  I mean, everyone's checking out the photos at WNAW.com.  Oh, great.  All right, Kate.  It was funny.  All right, I'll talk to you guys soon.  You got it.  There she goes, Kate.  Another one of the contestants from the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  She didn't make it all the way when she saw Mealworms, when she was looking up.  That was it for her.  And she started screaming, get me out.  I'm done.  Get me out.  Yep.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  He's in the studio.  Yeah.  He just picked up the video tapes, Anthony, from Friday's show. 
[02:36:00]  So now you're going to be able to see video clips on FoundryMusic.com in the coming days.  The pictures are revolting enough.  I can only imagine what it was like to be here in person.  I can only imagine how sick I'm going to get when I actually see the video.  Yeah.  It's going to be funny because I think you have some video back and forth and stuff.  Oh.  They're screaming.  Nothing but the highlight was Wendy's screams of horror when the bugs got thrown in.  That was the highlight of the afternoon for me.  I saw the picture of the cockroaches, and they're what, like three inches long? 
[02:36:30]  They're huge, and they hissed it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Very, very disgusting.  And Wendy's screams were the best.  We got to, I got to isolate some of those.  No, we got to.  Play them by myself.  We got them.  We're running out of time today, but we'll get to them tomorrow.  I think we do have another clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Let's play this.  It's a quick one.  It's only a minute and a half.  And then we're going to talk to Gary.  He was the bug guy from Friday.  He could tell us a little more about these hissing cockroaches that ran into the barrel. 
[02:37:00]  And also, Jane, another contestant from the 55-gallon drum challenge.  That means the only one we didn't hear from is Tabitha.  Oh, no, wait.  There's one more.  Christy.  Christy, that's right.  Christy.  Well, we'll hear from him.  The big green one is Christy.  Right.  All right, let's play this, and then we'll talk to Jane right after this.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  Christy.  Yeah?  How much liquid is at the bottom of your tank? 
[02:37:30]  Um, I can't see my toes.  Yeah, it tells me not seeing your toes isn't something new.  You can't make fun of Christy.  Come on.  She was a big gal.  She was a big gal.  She went 250, right?  I mean, just the fact that she had to have a completely different device to contain her.  Yeah.  Two barrels.  Two.  Hey, Rich, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going today?  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.  The girls fit in 55-gallon drums. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  Christy needed 120 gallons.  That was the size of her tank.  120 gallons.  That's like looking at the fish tank at the pet store and then going to see Shamu at SeaWorld.  Come on.  Give her a break, man.  All right.  What's up, Rich?  How's it going, guys?  Good.  Hey, I can't get those screams out of my head.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  Oh, my God.  I was all sorts of baked, driving home, listening to that. 
[02:38:30]  It horrified me.  Yeah, we haven't even gotten to the real good screams.  We're running out of time today, but when we put the bugs in the tank, oh, my God.  Yeah, they lost their minds.  They lost their effing minds.  And they were quiet.  There's a 20 or 30 second section of Wendy screaming that I felt so bad for her.  That's the part.  Yeah.  All right, Richie.  All right, guys.  Keep it up, man.  Thank you.  All right, let's go to Jane, another contestant for the 55-Gallon Drum Challenge. 
[02:39:00]  Jane, how are you?  Good.  How are you guys doing?  You sound much better today, Jane.  Well, it's been a rough weekend, I can tell you that much.  Yeah?  What happened to you?  Well, like Friday night, I could not sleep.  I could just feel like the sludge all over me.  I couldn't get the feeling out of my head.  You have like post-traumatic stress syndrome or something.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  And I had like these weird patches on my face.  They looked almost like chemical burns or something.  Yeah, well, we were throwing hydrochloric acid in the tank, unbeknownst to you.  And I'm so, so stiff. 
[02:39:30]  You girls all signed the releases, right?  Yeah.  What kind of burns on your face?  I don't know.  They were just like red patches on my face.  Yeah, it was probably from the Worcestershire sauce.  Oh, that killed me.  Maybe that was it.  That killed me.  That got in my eyes.  I couldn't see.  Everything was all blurry for, you know.  Or maybe the killer bees.  Yeah, those two.  Is the smell off your body yet?  I think so.  How many showers, Jane?  Well, showers are how many hair washers?  Because each shower had about three shampoos. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And you just stood under the running water?  That's right.  Curled up on the field.  More, more, more.  At the bottom of the tub, crying?  That's right.  Nothing like that?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  But, Jane, you made it to the end.  I did.  I did.  You made it through the hissing cockroaches.  Well, see, you guys did that wrong.  You should have showed that to us before you put it in, because I didn't know what it was  when it went in until afterwards.  Oh, something to think about for the next challenge.  That's right.  Like, the mental would be, you know, much worse to see it beforehand and know it was coming. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, because they were disturbing.  Yeah.  Did you have anything lodged in your junk?  Lodged in my junk?  Yeah.  I don't think so, no.  Are you sure?  Don't lie.  There wasn't a mealworm that worked its way in there?  Unless it's still in there.  I haven't seen anything like that.  Want to go fishing?  Yeah.  I was actually really worried.  I got hooked.  I actually went and got, like, prescription filled before I did this, because I was so 
[02:41:00]  worried I was going to get some kind of weird infection down there.  Yeah.  Well.  So, what was the worst for you, Jane?  The worst?  Yeah.  Well, there were so many bad things.  So many bad moments.  The Worcester sauce was really bad, because that burned.  Yeah, I thought that was going to be bad.  The guys who brought the stuff in with, like, the rotten yogurt and the Tabasco stuff and  sauce.  Yeah, the listeners that came in.  Yeah, that stuff was pretty bad. 
[02:41:30]  The crickets were horrible.  Yeah.  They really did hurt.  See, a lot of the girls were saying that they hurt.  Now, did you ever pick up a cricket outside?  Just their legs have, like, those spiny little things on them.  Yeah.  And when they walk on you, it feels like they're biting you.  And I think in the confines of a dark, dank, stinky drum, it probably feels a lot worse,  you know?  I mean, it wasn't like you just dumped in, like, ten crickets, either.  You know, we were covered in crickets.  There were, you know, any exposed skin had a cricket on them. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just got the heebie-jeebies.  There were hundreds of crickets in each barrel.  You know?  They're going to start multiplying all over this station.  God, we're going to start seeing cockroaches in another week or two everywhere.  You know what's strange?  If, like, we had soldiers that were taken prisoner, and they were put through the exact  same thing, we as a country would be outraged and want to nuke the country that did this.  But you girls pulled through it.  Like, it amazes me. 
[02:42:30]  I would have, I think I would have lost my mind and been sitting in my own feces.  Yeah.  I give you guys a lot of credit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I wasn't even doing it for the money.  I just wanted to see if I could do it.  And you did.  I think you had the easiest time out of the three that made it.  I would have to say Wendy had the hardest time that went the distance.  She told me afterwards she was crying when she was in the barrel.  I know.  We have that on tape.  We're going to play it probably tomorrow.  We're running out of time.  Yeah.  But you had the easiest time, then Tabitha, and then Wendy was just so close to giving in. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, she had a rough time with it.  So, yeah.  Very good.  That was a good idea.  The John McCain bamboo cage challenge next, like a Vietnam POW camp, will have you in there  up to your neck in water or something like that.  And then every hour, you all come out and play Russian roulette with like a cap gun, and  whoever loses is out.  Michelle wants to talk to you, Jamie.  Wow.  Michelle.  Wow. 
[02:43:30]  Hello.  Do it, Nikki.  Hi.  Hi, Michelle.  Why?  I just want to know, then, why were these idiots staying in there for $500?  No.  What was worth?  Why?  Well, first of all, they walked away with a ton of stuff.  Jane got $833 plus all sorts of other things.  And if only one of them walked out, they would have gotten $2,500.  Right.  They all got bikes from Shrewsbury Bicycles.  They got some real nice gift certificates from Joey Paisano.  They walked around a lot. 
[02:44:00]  I guess it was worth it.  I honestly caught it at the end.  My boyfriend had it on, and I was just cringing.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  No, you're making a good point, because Jane did say that she pretty much did it to see  if she could do it.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I just, I couldn't.  I mean, no money in the world would make it worse.  I mean, maybe the crickets did, but the hissing roaches, I just, I thought it was $500.  I caught it in the middle.  I'm sorry.  Michelle.  Take it back.  Michelle, just think about being in a dark barrel, and you don't know what's coming on  your head.  I would never do it.  I would never.  Maybe $25,000, and possibly, possibly, I'll sit in there, possibly, but I just, I, maybe 
[02:44:30]  those prizes, okay, they're sick, they've been through worse, whatever, I understand,  but I originally thought it was $500.  Then I thought the three of them had to split that, so I was going completely nuts.  And you're talking, like, fish guts, chum, rotting clams, sour milk, cream that was  left on a radiator for eight hours.  Oh, I definitely said half of you wouldn't have even done that.  Half of you wouldn't have even been in there.  Stas might have done it for just 10 minutes in a closet with some chick or something, but 
[02:45:00]  any normal person would not have stayed in there, but I understand, okay?  All right, Michelle, thank you.  Bye, back to you guys.  Definitely.  Bye.  I wouldn't have done it.  No way.  I'm a puss.  I wouldn't have made it.  I swear to God, there was no way in hell I would have been able to, uh...  Well, all you guys were pretty wimpish, I have to say.  Yeah.  Know what we've got to do...  Especially Rick.  Know what we've got to do?  Maybe for, uh, maybe Steve can put it on foundrymusic.com.  We need a whole list of the stuff that was dumped in these barrels, just so you understand  how sick this was.  Well, if you look at some of the pictures, you just see the, uh, the bottom of the barrels, 
[02:45:30]  and it, you can't even tell what any one ingredient is anymore.  I couldn't get on the website all weekend.  The website, anyw.com that has, uh, lots of pictures right now, and Steve, uh, is going  to put clips on it, and it's foundrymusic.com, um, video clips, and probably by late tonight,  uh, uh, they're just getting hammered, these websites, so you can check it out.  I'm looking at a Tabitha clip, uh, picture, and I'm seeing mealworms in her cleavage. 
[02:46:00]  Right?  Oh, yeah, that was the worst.  Everything that got caught in there.  Yeah, I know.  Ugh.  Oh.  So, so, Jane, uh, would you do it again?  Um, you mean, if I could go back in time, would I do it again, or would I do it a second  time?  Would you do it a second time?  Um, I might, actually.  I might.  Wow.  All the other girls said, no effing way.  But if we ever do it again, they will be invited back to, uh, deliver the goods.  Oh, we'll let you.  We'll be on the other end of the barrel?  Yeah.  Oh. 
[02:46:30]  And if we do do it again, we are going to up the ante.  Okay.  You guys got off easy.  Let's just put it that way.  If we ever do this again, we're upping the ante.  That's true.  We've already come, we've already come up with, uh, things that'll just make people lose their  effing minds.  Ugh.  All right, Jane.  All right.  Talk to you guys later.  Thank you.  Bye.  I don't know why.  I was looking at those.  I just looked at Christy's barrel.  The bottom of it.  I know.  You really see the, uh, V8 added the basic color to the bottom of it because it was orange. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  But then everything floating in it, and there's a big fish eyeball staring back at you.  I know.  I know.  I know.  All right, and let's take a break.  The bug guy's on the line from Friday's show.  I think we might be able to play one more clip from, uh, the 55-gallon drum challenge before  we get out of here as well.  Okay?  Okay.  Terrific.  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  The only show beats the hell out of my dad's little pornos.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. 
[02:47:30]  Yes, Paisano.  You want, uh, authentic Italian cuisine made from old world Italian recipes, priced right  in an atmosphere that gives you the romance of Italy, warm, friendly, relaxed.  Where are you going to go?  Huh?  That's not a rhetorical question.  Uh, Paisano, Anthony?  What?  What?  Yes, Paisano.  Is that your final answer?  Yes.  Enough with the final answer.  Poor Regis.  You know, everywhere he goes. 
[02:48:00]  I can't believe it.  Someone's got to work that in, and he probably feels like he's the first person to do it to  Regis.  Regis, is that your final answer?  Shut up already.  I'll pull a gun out and shoot you dead.  Final answer.  Suck it.  Poor guy.  He probably, everything, he likes to go out to a lot of restaurants.  Yeah.  Probably orders a drink.  Oh.  Regis, that's your final answer?  How about I bend you over?  Right.  Eat it. 
[02:48:30]  Paisano.  You'll love their huge, incredible pasta lunch specials.  If you want to go down there for lunch, or make a dinner reservation, or just drop by.  Paisano of Mulberry Street, in the heart of Little Italy, 136 Mulberry, call him.  965-1188, 965-1188.  You ask for Joey, the owner, what do you get?  A free glass of wine, Anthony?  Yes.  In the hot seat.  Opened seven days a week. 
[02:49:00]  Weekends till?  Two.  Two.  Ponderous, ponderous.  Yes.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Stop by, tell Joey we said hi.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  All right, we'll be back in two.  Two.  O.P. and Anthony.  Brilliant radio at his best.  Oh, God.  Help us.  107-1188.  Bennett.  Bennett.  Elements. 
[02:49:30]  Elements.  212757-1027, Anthony.  Hey.  We got Bug Guy from Friday's show.  Bug Guy, the guy with the bugs.  Bug Guy was the hit of the show Friday, in my humble opinion.  How are you, Gary?  All right.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  I want to thank you again for coming down with those sick bugs.  No problem.  I had a good time.  Thank you guys, too.  Yeah, you were cool.  You know, I went back home and I listened to the tape of the broadcast, and I was listening 
[02:50:00]  to Wendy, and oh my God, dude, she's got some blood-cuddling screams.  I felt so bad when I was listening to the tape.  Yeah, we all did.  Oh, it was horrible.  It didn't sound that bad in the studio.  No, we're going to replay the audio.  It's pretty bad.  Oh, the tape is so bad.  I think we weren't paying too much attention because we were trying to concentrate so we  wouldn't puke from the smell in the studio.  Yeah.  Hey, who said they didn't have any problems with the bugs?  Somebody said the chum was the worst thing. 
[02:50:30]  Jane.  Oh, she didn't get the cockroach treatment she didn't get.  Jane was pretty...  Oh, no, Jane stayed the whole thing, right?  Yeah, Jane was pretty cool, man.  She didn't really have much of a problem with this whole thing.  No, quite a trooper.  Wendy was the one that was just losing her mind, and Tabitha.  Who we'll hear from tomorrow.  She started off really cocky.  By the end, she wasn't even talking anymore, and she was meditating, trying to get through it.  Yeah, it was good stuff.  It was a lot of fun, man.  Yeah, where did you get those hissing cockroaches from?  I don't know. 
[02:51:00]  We get them from a wholesaler.  That's where we feed all our reptiles.  We actually don't feed them the cockroaches.  We feed them the crickets.  But the cockroaches, people buy them for pets, man.  Get out of here.  I swear.  I swear.  They really do.  They find them pretty bad.  They get cockroaches for pets?  Yeah.  Yeah, they get pretty big, too.  Those are like half size.  No way.  They get bigger.  They get bigger.  You know, are they going to multiply?  Because I'm sure we didn't get all of them.  I don't know.  I think they're going to breed with the New York City cockroach.  They're going to have some sort of mutant cockroaches.  Oh, man.  No one thought of that.  They might live off of that gook that was in the barrels, too. 
[02:51:30]  That could be...  Ugh.  Yeah.  By the way, everyone getting their cars downstairs today, we apologize.  Yeah.  It stinks in the garage.  I guess they put the barrels down there to store them.  Yeah.  We found out that the garbage man didn't come today.  It reeks in the basement, man.  Oops.  Sorry about that.  He probably knew what he was going to pick up.  Yeah.  But, man, you were the hit, Gary.  You were the hit.  Cool.  Anytime, guys. 
[02:52:00]  All right.  Good job.  Take care.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Thanks for checking in.  Adios.  There he goes.  Do we have time to play one more clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony?  I think so.  All right.  We'll play one more, and then we'll get into what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Here it is.  Opie and Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass.  Turn down your radio.  1027 WNEW.  Another highlight from the 55-gallon drum challenge, but not the real blood-curdling scream. 
[02:52:30]  No, we'll get to those tomorrow, finally.  You're not going to believe it if you missed it, but it was funny.  You could hear it in our voices that we were just getting pissed.  You know when, like, one of your buds, like, he farts so bad that you just get pissed?  You're like, what the hell, man?  We had that feeling on Friday.  The smell was getting so bad, we were just getting pissed.  All right, man.  Let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[02:53:00]  Good start to another radio, a week of radio.  Let's see.  I learned that the British have a problem with being the villains during a Revolutionary War movie.  Joey from the Bronx.  Today I learned on the weekend, any WDJs are worse than college DJs?  Yes.  For the most part, that is correct.  That's true.  Sumo from Connecticut.  I learned what the death penalty is.  Very good.  Don from Jersey. 
[02:53:30]  Today I learned that Opie really wants to be a black man.  Could it be because Sandy wants a white guy who is hung like a black man?  Hmm.  Joe from Queens.  Today I learned that Anthony got his first haircut since before the moon landing.  Yes.  And somebody else saying they learned I paid salon prices for my hair.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How are you?  Yeah, I learned two things.  I learned that the new number one morning show in New York City is The Shlew and the Lawyer.  Yes.  And I learned that you guys only started two for Torch and Women and WrestleMania tickets. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, that's true.  That's pretty much it.  A little obscure one for you, boys.  That's good.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  E-man from Jersey checking and saying that I learned that the Shweeley and the Lawyer show  beats Imus in the ratings for people who weren't rated for the ratings.  Right.  That's plain English.  That guy was out of his mind.  Shweeley and the Lawyer.  That was pretty funny.  Let's go to Vinny.  Vinny, what did you learn today?  I learned that there's no honor among DJs in New York City. 
[02:54:30]  What do you mean?  I mean, I think you guys are genuinely funny.  And even when you get a little outlandish with this bizarro stuff, but to diss Vince  Skelson and Eddie Trunk is just off the hook.  We didn't diss Eddie Trunk.  We didn't mention anyone by name.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Anthony, but you were definitely alluding to Vince Skelson.  I'll personally go on record as saying Vince Skelson's an effing tool.  And I'll back it up on that, too, but we never said anything about Eddie.  All right.  I live in Waza next to the track, so you might hear a train go through.  You're the guy that listens to Vin? 
[02:55:00]  Well, you know, I grew up in Massapequa and I used to listen to Vin all the time.  And he has shaped music.  You have to give him those props.  Does he honestly think he's doing anything special?  Well, I think...  Anyone can do that show.  I can't listen for more than, I swear to you, and I'm not exaggerating.  This isn't a joke.  A minute.  And I've tried.  I've been Sunday night driving home from something.  I put on N.E.W. for a minute, and I'm like, either he's babbling about something.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Or he's playing some song from the 40s or something. 
[02:55:30]  I'm out of there.  I punch out so fast.  Well, you saved some money on therapy that way.  You listen on Sunday night.  He's too cool for this friggin' room.  He's too cool for the people that work here now.  He disses and badmouths talk radio and this whole format in newspaper articles.  He could go F himself.  Go to the internet radio like you've been doing.  Have 200 people at a time, tops, listening to you before it's got a buffer and clips out on you. 
[02:56:00]  That's 10 times the people that are probably listening on N.E.W.  I don't understand why he keeps renewing his contract if he doesn't want to be here  and he talks bad about Ant and I and everyone else that works at this damn station.  Go away.  Go away with the rest of the friggin' fossilized crap F's that worked here when we got here.  All right.  Well, I apologize for the Eddie Trunk.  I thought that you said his name.  But he's doing a great thing going on.  No, we never mentioned him by then.  That's the only thing that has any bit of structure on the weekends is his show.  That's fine.  But as far as Vin goes, he could suck it. 
[02:56:30]  This radio station flat out blows on the weekends.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  And Vin thinks he's doing something special.  He's not doing anything special.  Thank God they got those bumps when you change lanes on the expressway.  When I was listening to Vin for a minute, I dozed off.  Well, I discovered one of the things I wouldn't have heard on regular, you know.  You could get a retarded kid to come in here with a bunch of albums from a bunch of different eras  and it would sound exactly the same.  Why?  It's so cool because it's eclectic, Opie. 
[02:57:00]  It's not eclectic.  It's just you throw some crap on from the 40s and then throw some crap on from the 80s  and you're a genius?  And then babble about something I don't even understand?  Get guests in here that people don't even know who they are?  Well, well...  And then badmouth the format of this station that is trying to pull it out of a 23rd place  toilet and doing better than anybody's done at this station in years?  Well, you give props to Howie.  And I understand that.  But I think in the same way, you should definitely give props to Vince. 
[02:57:30]  No way.  Because I don't think your program would be possible.  You can't even compare...  Howard did something in this medium.  You can't compare Howard and Vince Skilsa.  Jesus Christ.  You go all the way back to...  Vince plays records, dude.  Freeform FM.  How hard is it to play records?  God, I hate everyone's buying that.  Matt and I, like, you know, let everyone know.  It's not hard to play records!  No, but it's Freeform, right?  Freeform.  He's playing...  He's playing...  Freeform.  You know something?  That whole thing, you're buying into it. 
[02:58:00]  You're buying into that whole thing.  He's a legend.  The three people that listen to him.  Oh, it's Freeform.  It's great.  Let's...  You want to do an example of Freeform?  Close your eyes, Rick.  Grab two CDs.  Don't effing look.  Close your eyes.  Grab that one.  Grab another one.  There.  Open two CD players.  There.  Open two CD players.  Opie, don't look at the track.  Pop one in there.  No, no.  Leave...  And pop the other CD in the other one. 
[02:58:30]  And seg the end to the beginning of that one.  Oh, okay.  I can do this.  I hope you can do this.  Watch the genius of Opie now doing Freeform Radio.  Yeah.  Oh, Rick was there.  That's something like he would play, too.  There you go.  Freeform Radio.  Opie's an effing genius. 
[02:59:00]  He's a legend in New York.  Plus, on top of it, I gave you a little comedy.  If you know anything about this radio, you can't say that, Opie.  That would be a little bit beyond the Freeform event.  I'm so sick of these DJs.  Freeform.  Yeah.  Hang up.  Opie's throwing the phones.  Put the phone back.  You can hang up on him by pushing a button, Opie.  You don't have to throw the phone.  I'm so sick of these. 
[02:59:30]  What the hell happened?  He almost hit me with the CDs.  I didn't throw any CDs.  Holy smoke.  Opie's just doing Freeform Radio.  He's a genius like that.  You heard that, Seg.  I'm so sick.  I had to listen to this crap growing up about all these high and mighty DJs that thought  they were something because they could seg goddamn records on the air. 
[03:00:00]  And then they hide behind it by calling it Freeform Radio and Eclectic Radio.  No, you're singing goddamn tunes.  I would love to know.  I could go to a mental hospital and get a DJ to spin tunes that would sound a hell of a  lot more interesting than Vince Skelson and all their crappy jocks in this goddamn town.  I'm so sick of it.  How many people are listening on Sunday night?  I have no clue, but I would say it's got to be in the tens of people. 
[03:00:30]  And then he badmouths the format and goes somewhere else.  And I've read articles where he badmouths us personally.  Of course he does.  F off.  Comes in here with the attitude like he's God's gift to radio.  What a tool.  Him and his whole effing crew.  F off.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave any W.  You're like a barnacle hanging onto the hull. 
[03:01:00]  We want to pull away.  All these legendary DJs.  Now, a bunch of them work for Q104 playing the same stale, tired tunes.  But they're legends because they can seg records on a radio station.  Push a button.  Push a button.  Hate to tell you this, but even in the heyday of PLJ, they weren't doing anything special.  They were just spinning records.  But they're legends because they could do that.  99% of our audience could do what we do. 
[03:01:30]  Yep.  Before we started talking.  That's a fact.  Playing records.  He's playing records.  You do it at your home every day.  If you want to go home and then pop a CD into the CD player and hit play, there you go.  You're doing it.  You're an eclectic genius.  So sick of the crap.  There is such destruction going on at this studio.  Ow!  All right.  Opie just hit Ben. 
[03:02:00]  Opie just threw a box set and hit Ben right in the side and in the arm.  We shoot.  We shoot, Ben.  Opie, you have such a talent with hitting people when you throw something in anger.  Ben, I'm sorry.  You all right, Ben?  I'm fine.  Ben, get on the mic.  I didn't mean to hit you, all right?  Look at his arm.  Oh, my gosh.  It was the whole box set.  It hit him in the forearm.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  All right.  Time to sweep up.  Show's over.  You got so many broken CDs in there again.  Joey, if it wasn't for Ben and the other old jocks, you wouldn't have a job. 
[03:02:30]  F me and go suck it.  Because that isn't even the...  You know, come up with a valid point.  Now, I might even argue it or agree with you.  What does Ben have to do with me having my job?  Holding his seat with the other bastard fossils that were here for 20 years  so that younger jocks couldn't get in to this station?  I'll tell you one thing.  If it wasn't for all those guys before us, we would have been on the radio 10 years ago.  10 years earlier.  We had to wait for people to either die or retire. 
[03:03:00]  Because they were legends, Anthony.  Legend.  Legend.  And now a legend has three people listening to him on Sunday.  And he tools on us.  It's a talk station now.  Could you leave?  Suck up what little pride you have left  and move your friggin' freak show to your record player to the internet or something?  Please?  And I'll tell you something else. 
[03:03:30]  That whole wall of CDs is going to go very soon.  Yep.  Very soon.  We're going to force this stupid station's hand to do something on the weekends that makes sense.  And if I was Vince, I would hide his vinyl.  Yeah.  The vinyl's next.  Hide your vinyl.  Take it home with you.  Do something.  Because I swear to God, that'll sound really good smashing over this console.  I don't care what kind of collector's item it is.  And those turntables over there, too. 
[03:04:00]  I want to make a pottery wheel out of it.  I want to get some clay.  Can we make clay?  We'll get some whores up here.  And we'll play Ghost.  We'll do the scene from Ghost.  We'll slap some clay.  We'll have to make pots.  We'll feel some boobs.  And ruin the turntables.  No.  No.  Opie, no.  No.  You don't throw that.  He's going to throw the magic eight ball at the CD wall.  You know it's just going to bust.  Look what he does.  What?  Wait.  Look at these records.  Oh, no. 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  Look at that.  You've got to lift it up.  You know what that is?  Wow.  That's a big case.  What is that?  That's the Vinskelser collection.  That's the entire Vinskelser collection in the wooden, in the locked wooden cabinet.  Oh, yeah.  Right behind you is calling him right now. 
[03:05:00]  Hey, who's on the hotline?  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Put that thing.  It's going to break.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's what the inside of a magic eight ball looks like. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Could you just leave?  You love the Internet radio thing.  The Internet, like you wrote about.  He did an interview in some paper.  I don't even know what it is, but someone sent it to us.  And he's totally trashing the format of this station and trashing what people on this station are trying to do.  He goes screw.  Leave then.  Please leave.  We want to make a go at this as a talk station.  And you're just in the way. 
[03:06:00]  Take your vinyl.  Go to the Internet where 20 people at a time can log on.  And you can hear a clipped version of every wacky tune you're trying to play.  Please.  Could you do that?  Thank you.  All right, man.  Let's go home.  Okay.  Terrific.  Let's get out the broom again.  Every day we start smashing CDs again.  No one got the hint last time.  How many did we break today?  I learned three words.  Anger, management, therapy. 
[03:06:30]  Very good.  Whoever wrote that.  All right, man.  Another stellar show.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Listen to the sweeping.  Dr. D'Amano Ripoff.  Listen to the sweeping.  This is going to happen every day.  We're going to break out the broom and have to sweep away the old.  We've been here two years.  How many CDs did we break today?  At least 25.  At least 25? 
[03:07:00]  Good.  And all the bruises are gone.  Don't break the No Doubt CD.  We're going to need that.  Yeah, please.  It's my favorite.  How are we going to abuse Anthony if we break the No Doubt CD?  Absolutely.  All right, man.  We've got to get out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go.  All right.  Thanks for listening.  You are a psychopath, man.  Why?  You're schizo.  Why?  What happened?  Something happened today?  What happened? 
[03:07:30]  You're funny.  You almost killed every one of the people that work here.  I almost broke.  You all right, Ben?  I almost broke your arm.  I apologize for that.  Sometimes I blank out and I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  That's okay.  Limit.  All right.  We'll be back to do a live read and maybe we'll give something away here.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Stay there.  O.P.  Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass.  Turn down your radio. 
[03:08:00]  1027 WNEW.  By the way, we wish Mr. Imus well.  Yeah.  Speedy recovery for the I-Man from injuries sustained on my horse, Destiny.  Ho, Destiny.  We were messing with him, but we definitely wish him well.  Punchered lung.  Broken collarbone.  Five broken ribs.  Separated shoulder.  I crushed my big fag cowboy hat.
