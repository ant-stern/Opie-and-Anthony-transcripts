<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a discussion centered on producer Rob Cross's habit of bringing Pop-Tarts to the studio each morning.  The hosts and staff debated the implied brown-nosing inherent in the gesture, along with a critical assessment of the subpar Pop-Tart flavor selections.  Rob Cross eventually joined the broadcast to defend his actions, ultimately conceding to diversify his breakfast offerings.

This segment transitioned into a prolonged and humorous dissection of staff member Roland's propensity for falling asleep in a variety of settings, including during a movie, a Paul McCartney concert, and even during work meetings.  The hosts detailed numerous instances of Roland's slumber, with considerable mockery directed towards his sleeping habits.

A significant portion of the show featured a call from Jay Moore, a Christopher Walken impersonator, who delivered an extended, rambling impression punctuated by profanity and movie quotes.

The broadcast also briefly referenced recent guest appearances, namely Donald Trump Jr. and Howie Mandel. The hosts teased an upcoming appearance by an unnamed, major Hollywood legend. Finally, they replayed a clip from a previous show featuring The Rock, who famously walked off the air during that segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  After ONA Live.  You stopped breathing in the movie last night, you know that.  No.  It was scary.  And then your whole body did this, like, convulsion thing, and then you started breathing again.  You gotta sleep at night.  Actually, it's like Rob Cross, I was choking during lunch, and Rob just looked at me, he got up and went around me while I was choking.  That's true, Roland once was eating a mint.  He started choking, and none of us noticed because his back was to the rest of us.  But Rob Cross saw him choking and just goes, and kept talking to me and E-Rock, while Roland had tears coming down his eyes, and his face was beet red. 
[00:00:30]  And that's a big face to turn red.  Yeah, I think that's like an HR issue.  Letting me die.  Are you gonna bring up the Pop-Tarts thing?  What Pop-Tarts?  Are you not brave enough, right?  We threw them out.  I had delicious...  No, there's two more boxes in here.  And you guys aren't brave enough to do it.  I have to do all the dirty work for everybody, right?  Excuse me, I do plenty of...  Even though everyone's talking about the Pop-Tarts and how lame it is that Rob Cross comes in here at 5 in the morning.  This morning with Pop-Tarts to try to get on our good side.  But none of you guys are gonna mention it, right?  Travis, what did I have for breakfast this morning? 
[00:01:00]  Pop-Tarts.  I eat the Pop-Tarts.  I do my fair share of bringing up dirt.  If we're gonna do behind-the-scenes stuff, let's do it.  Yeah, bringing Pop-Tarts is gay.  There you go.  Give me bacon, eggs, that's breakfast.  Pop-Tarts?  What do you think of the Pop-Tarts, Troy?  I think it's great.  I didn't even know they were here.  Company guy.  You're too new still.  Company guy.  Company guy.  What?  Who's gonna complain about Pop-Tarts?  Wait, wait.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, what do you think of the Pop-Tarts?  No, I hate Pop-Tarts.  Well, what do you think of Rob bringing them in?  But why do you guys feel you can only do it if I'm still on mic? 
[00:01:30]  This is the shit you should be doing in the 10 o'clock hour.  It's something that happens around here.  These guys, these babysitters, they take turns coming in early to go,  see, we care about the channel and you guys.  And then it's not good enough that they show up at 5, 5.15 in the morning when we're here  every day.  They bring Pop-Tarts because they're brown nosers because they know at one point in my  career I like Pop-Tarts.  It's only $2.99 too, cheap people.  And they don't even get the kind I like.  Because you're the boss of them, but they're the boss of us. 
[00:02:00]  So I can't come on after O&A and start calling them babysitters the way you do it on actual O&A.  This is behind the scenes stuff.  Rob showed up today, said, hey, I'm here.  And I'm like, oh, terrific.  What am I supposed to say?  Great.  Oh, Danny's running up the hallway.  And then he walks in and he dumps his Pop-Tarts on the table and it's all shitty fucking flavors  that I wouldn't eat.  Sam did say it was very gay.  No.  Sam said it was gay.  I ate Pop-Tarts.  No, Danny's in here.  I would like to know what Danny thinks about the Pop-Tarts. 
[00:02:30]  Danny, what do you think about the Pop-Tarts?  We're having an open discussion about the Pop-Tarts.  Hold on, I'll set it up where no one gets fired.  We all are in agreement that it's very awkward when he comes in with his Pop-Tarts, like  an offering, like, look, we could get along.  And Opie's here and it's just for the air.  What do you think, Danny?  Oh, we're back to those rules?  It's just for the air.  I don't believe that.  Is Rob doing this?  Yes.  Is Rob having the balls to go in?  Okay, he can't hear you right now, Danny.  What do you think of the Pop-Tarts?  He's walking up the hallway.  I think that it's ridiculous and I don't understand why you're trying to ask us so much.  Just fucking come in if you have to. 
[00:03:00]  Okay, okay.  You got it.  All right, cool.  You got it.  Okay, he didn't hear you.  He's not going to bang it to the glass like a bird, is he?  Oh, Jesus.  Opie, how dare you?  Hey, Rob, how are you?  Rob Cross.  First time.  Rob Cross.  It's like a party.  First of all, Rob, I would like to say on behalf of After Opie and Anthony Live, thank  you for bringing in the Pop-Tarts today.  I know they went over big.  I'm going to start with a compliment, Rob Cross.  You have good taste in clothes.  Thank you.  The John Barr Vados Converse Collection.  Oh, thank you.  I might own a few of those myself. 
[00:03:30]  We got to get down to this, Rob.  Rob's getting comfortable.  The Pop-Tart thing is really uncomfortable for everybody.  Not for me.  You guys don't have interns, so, you know, since you don't, I figured I'd just bring in  some fucking Pop-Tarts.  When I come in early, why not?  I liked Pop-Tarts for maybe a month, two years ago.  That's the only breakfast food you talk about and the only one that people don't have to  cook in the morning, so I figured I'd have to save it back.  Multi-grain Cheerios with some fruits and blueberries and some bananas and a little yogurt. 
[00:04:00]  And you come in with these shitty Pop-Tart flavors.  You don't like this?  I mean...  Rob, I'll be your friend here.  I will tell you this.  You come in with the Pop-Tarts and literally...  It's blueberry frosted.  As soon as you leave the studio after putting the Pop-Tarts...  They say, fuck this.  Jokes about robbing his Pop-Tarts start.  Because you do...  Every time you come in early, you bring the Pop-Tarts in.  That's when the jokes start.  When we see you at five in the morning, we go, ooh, Pop-Tarts.  It's Pop-Tart Day.  I'll switch it up next time.  I'll come with something a little bit different. 
[00:04:30]  Toasted strudel.  You know what?  Toasted strudel.  Nice.  How about some scones?  I like a nice raspberry scone every once in a while.  I mean, it is 5 a.m.  Where do I get a raspberry scone at 5 a?  Go to fucking Starbucks like everyone else.  I'll tell you this.  Yes, Anthony always brings up cakey or flaky.  If you came in with some marble cake, I know it certainly would shock jock.  All right, next 5 a.m., I'm coming in with some next-level shit.  I'll go with a raspberry scone.  Raspberry scone.  And we'll go with a marble cake from Starbucks. 
[00:05:00]  There we go.  Enough of the Pop-Tarts.  I'm glad we got this out on the air, because these pussies weren't going to talk about it unless I was here.  I'll speak also on behalf of the staff.  A lot of the staff likes a hot breakfast, but later in the day, so maybe just some cash.  Like, you could just give us the cash, and we'll go get breakfast later.  Yes, that's easy to get.  All right.  And again, can I briefly address the Roland choking issue?  Yes, yes.  You watched as Roland choked almost to death.  I thought he was fucking around.  I mean, he comes in sometimes, he sits in my office, and he'll sit behind the divider,  so I can't see him.  He'll just make weird, like, noises where he's choking, having digestive things. 
[00:05:30]  I didn't know he was being real with it.  Roland's a real asshole in meetings.  Oh, he's the worst.  He's an asshole.  He's an asshole.  You can admit.  How much of an asshole can you be when you're asleep?  But I think he gets away with it.  Yeah, when he's awake.  I think Roland gets away with it a lot, because you don't really understand what he's saying,  but he's saying some evil shit, if you know how to speak Roland.  And also, in these meetings.  Who speaks Roland, though?  I mean, I speak a little bit.  I'm getting more fluent.  A little bit.  I speak a little Roland.  I speak fluent Roland, and it's all about the time you put in. 
[00:06:00]  He also finds opportunities to say dirty words in meetings.  That's his new thing.  Like, if you remember in our last meeting, he brought up a certain show with women getting fingered on it.  Yeah, he knew that there was no fingering going on.  He just wanted to see how many times he could say fingering in a meeting.  Yeah, he did work it in, like, a good three or four times.  That's the current record.  It goes to Roland.  Fucking Roland.  Sorry, Roland.  But it's true.  I'm just thankful that I didn't have to give you a mouth-to-mouth at the movie theater last night, Roland. 
[00:06:30]  He did that at the...  We went to the HBO taping for the Pee Wee Herman show.  Out.  Everyone's punching him to wake up, because he's almost, you know, bothering the performers.  But then at the end, they shoot the reversals where they get the crowd reaction.  So when you see it on HBO, Roland's awake the whole time, applauding, having a great time.  He was dead cold out.  Well, last night, I didn't know.  We covered this, so I guess you could hear it in the replay.  But what the hell, I'm live right now.  On the east.  Roland fell asleep at the theater, and then I didn't know there were two big-time reviewers 
[00:07:00]  behind us, and they were kicking your seat.  They were so fucking pissed, because you were distracting them, and they're trying to get,  you know, their review together for this Danny McBride movie.  How far into it does he fall asleep?  How long does it take him?  Last night?  Like, instantly.  Yeah, it was instant, I guess, but I...  Opening credits are off, or is it like...  I looked after the first big, you know, big over-the-top scene, and he was out cold.  So within 15 minutes, I would say?  There was a big laugh, and you look over to Roland, trying to figure out why your buddy's  not laughing with you, and he's just out cold. 
[00:07:30]  And I'm a dick, because he was leaning over so far, I'm thinking he's gotta fall on the  aisle, and how funny would that be?  Yeah, it would be great.  And instead of maybe waking him up and going, hey, dude, you wanna just leave this thing?  Roland has two sleep moves.  His head either goes back over the chair, where you think he's choking while he's sleeping,  or he tucks his head into his chest like a bird going to sleep, and then he slowly just  creeps over until he's almost out of the chair.  Yeah, he had a sideways thing going on.  He's become the master of three-minute office naps. 
[00:08:00]  Don't think I'm not aware of this, because I watch you, and what he does is, I watch him,  he goes to sleep, he's all the way back in his chair, and then by the time I turn around  to grab my phone to video him, he's sitting back up at his computer.  He takes three-minute office naps.  Do you not, Roland?  No, I do not.  Then why are you laughing so hard?  He can't admit that.  He does.  You can also tell when he's going for...  I laugh at my sleep, because I'm happy.  He was laughing at his sleep at the theater.  And I'm so pissed, because, you know, obviously I film a lot of shit, but I was too scared 
[00:08:30]  that I was going to get dragged out of there, but there was some great stuff going on last  night.  Him laughing in his sleep, the death rattle, and the people kicking his seat bar.  When he death rattles up, do you ask him if he's okay, or do you just kind of take for  granted and he's fine?  You've got to listen to the replay, because Ant was busting my balls about it, like, really?  Maybe you should try to help him, or Jimmy was.  Yeah, see the same thing with the choking.  If your friend's death rattling, you want to see how it plays out on its own.  Seriously, Roland.  He was also the guy that fell asleep during the sound check for the Paul McCartney concert. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, Paul McCartney's playing Maybe I'm Amazed to 20 People, and he's fucking out cold.  Is that the song he was playing?  Oh, it was out.  I can't even defend that.  It's Paul McCartney.  They were taping him sleeping in the chair.  Roland, and Troy even twit-picked a picture of it.  Roland.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had it up on Twitter.  I didn't see that one.  Here's a picture.  I follow you too, Troy.  Why?  Troy Kwan with a Q, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but what do you follow?  I mean, Troy's never.  He's like a hipster.  Check out some of that hipster shit. 
[00:09:30]  DJing something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Getting on his skateboard.  Roland, how many hours a night, on a typical night, do you sleep?  Like, I'm not talking about now.  I mean-  A lot.  Like, on Friday, I fell asleep at 7.30 at night, then woke up at 2 in the afternoon on  Saturday.  What about during the week?  10 in the afternoon.  I didn't realize there was a 10 in the afternoon.  What about during the week?  I'm sorry.  The Puerto Rican walked by me, so my brain went-  That's understandable.  During the week, like on a work day.  I'll fall asleep around 8, 9.  And then you wake up at like 5?  Yeah.  Well- 
[00:10:00]  What are you doing during the day that you're falling asleep all day?  I don't know.  People bore me.  Roland?  That bike protects me.  I don't know if I did it justice on the show, but when you acknowledge that you fell  asleep last night in the movie, and then we're walking out, and I told you I might have  it on film.  I've never heard of a better laugh in my life.  What was that about?  Uncomfortableness?  Yeah, because I know everybody's trying to catch me sleeping video.  We're all trying to catch him sleeping and snoring.  And he comes to my house every once in a while.  We'll watch a screen or something, or maybe some, well, it's not a Jets game or something, 
[00:10:30]  and he always falls asleep.  And he'll jump up and stare at me immediately, like, did you have your AC flipped for that?  He tells me, because he says that he goes over to your house with screeners for guests,  and you tell him, if you stay here, I'll watch this right now.  If not, I'm not watching this.  And he said...  That's for the purpose of getting him on...  He said it's pure torture, because he has to sit for 90 minutes and not sleep, and he  can't get it done. 
[00:11:00]  Roland's privy to the kid thing, though.  Yeah.  90-minute screeners take three hours in my house.  Oh, and so Roland...  Only the people with parents understand.  And Roland's like, and I apologize, like, Roland, I gotta feed the kid and do this and change  his diaper and stuff.  You understand.  And he's too nice to say no, so there's another 20 minutes where we're not...  He's still watching the film, and he's still can't sleep.  Yeah, because take me home tonight, started at 5 and ended at 9.30.  Jesus.  Yeah, because he was fussy that day.  That's probably about right, yeah.  That one might have taken close to four hours.  In Roland's spare time, he plays Xbox, and he does the Xbox Live with the headset on. 
[00:11:30]  E-Rock would love to share a story about playing Xbox Live.  No, it's almost every time.  When we were playing Red Dead Redemption on the multiplayer, and we have the headset so you  can talk, and being a posse, you go into a town, you're supposed to be a  shooting people, and Roland's doing pretty good.  He's sniping people's horses.  Then all of a sudden, you just see Roland's character going downhill, and then just stops,  and he doesn't participate.  And you're like, where the hell's Roland?  And all of a sudden, you hear...  He fell asleep in the middle of the game, and then later on, we're already in another 
[00:12:00]  town or something, and he rejoins.  Hey, guys, where are you?  And it's like three hours later.  You gotta get tape of that.  We've been trying, but Xbox is weird to hook up.  Roland, you don't live a healthy lifestyle.  He's trying.  I'm trying.  Is he trying?  I think he's bullshitting me, but I am.  He is trying.  We go and get...  I have one meal, and then I juice for my dinner.  We meet at the juice store a lot.  I do drink a lot of juice.  Yeah, but you can't wait online too long, because he ends up collapsing and falling asleep 
[00:12:30]  while they're squeezing carrots.  I hope he's trying.  I want to take him to my sleep doctor.  Get him fixed.  See...  Yeah, come test.  Because it did wonders for you.  It did great for me.  Iraq, face.  Why do you do that to yourself?  You can't even get to work on time.  That has nothing to do with sleep.  Yes, it does, because you come into work looking like you just woke up at 5.54.  Nah.  At least Roland wakes up in the morning.  There's no guarantee he's going to stay up all day, but he gets up. 
[00:13:00]  True that.  Can I go home now?  I don't know.  I mean...  I know we're having fun, but...  Rob's a boss.  Yeah, I'm not.  No, Rob.  I'm out of here as well.  Rob, I know you want to get along with us better.  This will help right here.  Take your stupid fucking Pop-Tarts.  Throw the garbage and get the hell out of here.  Throw the garbage.  I'm going to eat these guys.  Be one of the guys.  Don't waste those.  Don't waste those afternoon snacks.  How about you throw one away?  And then keep going.  Keep going.  I mean, if you think it'll be therapeutic, I'll toss one away.  But you guys...  It'll be therapeutic for you.  And I want to see some anger.  Yeah, chuck it.  Anger?  Chuck it.  I mean, I've loved Pop-Tarts since I was five.  I don't have anger toward them. 
[00:13:30]  No, but here's what you're thinking of.  You're thinking of the air talent and the staff going, look at this fucking asshole.  Oh, okay.  Walking up with his shitty Pop-Tarts.  Look at this idiot.  Now, where's that anger?  I'm going to give you one and you set the...  That's hack at this point.  Where's the anger, Rob?  Look at this fucking guy.  I'll tell you this about Rob Cross.  I respect Rob because I can't get to him like I can Gary.  You can tell when you've broken Gary?  Oh, yeah.  But Rob is just like, whatever, dude. 
[00:14:00]  Rob's tough.  I've met a lot of angry people in radio over the last...  Rob's tough.  He just threw Pop-Tarts.  Oh, Eric!  Eric, you all right?  What is that for?  That's not even really...  That wasn't even really rageful.  It did nothing.  You can do it.  It didn't even break.  Eric, that was about as entertaining as your...  You can still post those things.  That was about as entertaining as your story about the WrestleMania press conference today.  Tune in to the replay.  You rock up.  He's chucking Pop-Tarts.  I'm going to call facilities.  I don't know, guys.  I think E-Rock was going for a moment and it was successful. 
[00:14:30]  I don't think so.  No, you don't think so?  I don't think so.  We got him this hour, Sam.  Well, I mean, I still got...  Maybe I'll stay for 20 more minutes and then Ron will carry it to 11.  I still got...  Well, I'm here, too.  Oh.  I still got the clips of Donald Trump Jr.  Nice.  Howie Mandel.  Nice.  I mean, there's more to The Rock interview that I could air it because we're going to  air the segment of The Rock walking out on the show from a couple years ago.  And since it's Christopher Walken's birthday, although there's no way we're going to squeeze  all this in now because we spent all this time talking about rolling, sleeping, and Pop-Tarts. 
[00:15:00]  But it's Christopher Walken's birthday.  So we were going to play a little Jay Moore for the people.  Oh, good.  Is this stuff...  Does this sound entertaining to you?  How about you start doing some of this?  All right.  Well, let me start with the Jay Moore clip, then.  Is that okay with you, Opie?  It's fine.  It's your show.  I'm glad you recognize that.  I'm going to hold you to that.  You just said it on the air.  I'm just a spectator in your world, Sam.  What can I tell you?  Well, then I'm going to throw it to my man, E-Rock, on my show after Opie and Anthony 
[00:15:30]  live with Sam Roberts.  This, in honor of Christopher Walken's birthday, is the ultimate Walken impressionist, Jay Moore.  Rob Cross, thanks again for the Pop-Tarts.  After Opie Live.  Jay Moore's on the line, but I can't get it.  Oh, my God.  Jay Moore.  Don't go anywhere.  Can you use the keyboard?  No.  Scroll up.  Scroll, scroll.  Hiya, boys.  There he is.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Before I put on my friend Jay, I wanted to fan how short I am. 
[00:16:00]  Another ah.  You boys, boy, you're good.  But a few days in a row, you've been tagging good old Al.  Yeah.  I don't even have to see the landlord, Jimmy.  But we don't understand what happened.  You were a soft-spoken actor early in your career, and now you're just a loudmouth.  Well, in the beginning of my career, I kind of sounded like Tony Daly.  Tony Daly.  If you watch us all day after noon, it's, uh, okay.  But, you know, we're Catholics.  We don't want to kill anybody. 
[00:16:30]  You know?  We're being on veterans.  Killing, that don't mean nothing to us.  Put the gun down!  Put the gun down!  And then, uh, you know, but if you look at Cagney and Lacey, she says the same thing like,  Yes, okay, Hoff.  Thanks a lot.  And then, uh, as I got older, I turned to Big Daddy from Canada on the hot chin roof.  Maggie.  It's not easy being cheesy, boys.  I'm going to do all the commercials, like the quicker picker-upper when I work on my nails. 
[00:17:00]  I don't have propitia.  Yeah, people are saying you have alopecia.  Alopecia, propitia.  That's why I'm working on phonics, Anthony.  Because I don't know certain words.  I just know in 88 minutes my hair was orange.  Yeah, it was.  I'm Pesci in JFK.  My wig was crooked and I wanted to throw a gay party with a friend. 
[00:17:30]  He's got that down.  I'm so impressed, Jimmy.  You get to tell jokes.  And you think you're special because you're painted a fucking male.  What movie?  I'm going to guess Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  No.  Why don't you just, like, embarrass everybody, you idiot?  That's been great, Colin.  That's why he's not here.  I'm conscious of this and just yell out random quotes and go, okay, quick, what movie?  And then when they're wrong, go, I'm smarter than you. 
[00:18:00]  I knew what I was saying.  Yo, you should let Tracy Morgan talk to Jimmy.  I got schizophrenia.  I just slapped my belly off in preschool.  His belly.  And a doo-doo diaper pamper.  What's great about Tracy Morgan is, at the end of every sentence, he makes it sound like he wants to have sex. 
[00:18:30]  For example, hey, Jimmy, I love your company.  You make me laugh every time, especially when you do your closing bit.  If I was Norm MacDonald, and I wanted to see Jimmy perform, where did I go?  Ticketmaster, Norm. 
[00:19:00]  Ticketmaster.  You know what's great about a Jim Norton show?  There's lots of dirty whores.  Lots and lots of dirty whores.  And they're easy to pick up, you know.  You walk up to them and say, let's go.  Oh, no, that's all wrong.  Jimmy's a changed man. 
[00:19:30]  I look up at Jimmy, literally.  Hi, boys.  Oh, J-Mar.  Holy shit.  I've been here for a long time, but I haven't been able to call because I've wanted to do dirty impressions,  and I've had little boys in my car.  Yeah, well.  That didn't sound right at all.  Was that your children?  Yeah, children?  Yeah, right?  He's just driving around.  Usually he has a son in the car.  He's got to keep the car through the lane.  He's moving over.  I've got to drop off a loading zone.  Come on. 
[00:20:00]  When did I join a jazz band?  Cha-cha-cha.  Cha-cha.  Diarrhea.  Cha-cha-cha.  Frank Caliendo can suck my balls.  I'll do Robin Williams, too.  Yes, of course.  Well, maybe.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Me.  Oh.  Hey, big.  Hey, everybody.  Just fucking breathe a little bit. 
[00:20:30]  You moron.  You hit him too fast.  You got to, you know, the symphony.  That's the pauses, dummy.  I got that backwards.  Scratch that and reverse it.  Gene Wilder says in the chocolate factory, Opie, you're so naive.  You're adorable.  I like your high-high real Opie when you're standing by the fishbowl.  Oh, Jimmy.  What does Caliendo do?  I'll do it better.  This is my new battle.  It's like Supac and Biggie. 
[00:21:00]  Caliendo, huh?  He does Bush.  He does...  Let's break it down.  He does Madden.  John Madden.  I'm not wearing any wigs, so you got to forgive me.  Yeah.  You do Madden?  Madden?  Well, here's a guy who runs, he goes faster, and he's...  That's Madden.  That's pretty close.  That's very close.  He does...  He does Bush.  He does George Bush.  He does...  That's all we know.  He does Forrest Whitaker?  No, he doesn't.  I know.  I just made that up. 
[00:21:30]  Jesus.  I will say this about Forrest Whitaker, Jimmy.  I want...  I can't open my eye.  Have you heard my Chris Tucker?  No.  No.  Beep, beep, man.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Blah, blah, bleep, bleep, black man's radio.  Blah, blah, blah, bleep, beep, beep, beep.  That's what I hear. 
[00:22:00]  You can push a Marble Mountain golfer.  Holy shit.  Oh, Jay, why you got to go blue?  I'm just called the year of the day.  I love it so.  You didn't do Harvey Keitel today.  Look, a couple of beautiful girls.  Gentlemen, let me explain something to everyone in the room right now, okay?  Who are the bunch of interns and you guys?  No, a whole studio audience.  About 20, 20...  Where's the big fat Bobby?  Dude, the thing with Taylorin.  Jimmy, will you give me a little Bobby Kelly? 
[00:22:30]  You know what, dude?  He picked a chick to run, dude, because he knows the women are never going to vote for a black guy.  Shut up, Bob.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  That's my favorite.  Who did you ask?  Oh, Keitel.  All right, let me explain the World Series to you guys in depth.  Okay.  Who's going to be okay?  Say the goddamn words!  There you go.  That's what I want to hear. 
[00:23:00]  I want to hear Keitel.  It's got to go seven games, Anthony.  The revenue money between those two cities alone.  Everyone knows there's no jobs in this town, are there?  So, it's got to go seven.  All right, listen.  I went to the ballpark today.  And I saw Darryl Strawberry.  And I looked in his eyes.  And he told me he's saving it for the big one.  You want to make money?  Leave it on the Mets. 
[00:23:30]  And then fucking Victor Argo goes, yeah, fuck it.  I'm in.  Like, somehow that's fucking worked.  Like, I went to the park.  I saw Darryl Strawberry.  And then he told me he's saving it all for game seven.  And they're all like, oh, I didn't know that.  So, yeah.  A couple of beautiful girls.  What were you guys like?  I love Keitel, though, in Reservoir Dogs is the best.  Say the goddamn words!  Where he's talking about fucking, what's his name going crazy?  Bang! 
[00:24:00]  Bang!  What the fuck was Joe thinking?  Hiring an animal like that!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  It was like a goddamn shitting gallery!  Why don't you rub some water on your face?  Try to relax.  Joe, I don't know what you think you know.  But you're wrong.  He's a good kid.  He got shot in the gut.  It's my fault he got shot in the gut. 
[00:24:30]  What the hell for?  That lump of shit's working for the LAPD.  Larry, stop pointing that gun at my gate!  Say the goddamn words!  I think you're law of control.  I told my wife that Rich Voss was a Bodak, and she goes, what the, you know, like, what  do you, how?  And I go, let me just show you.  And I put him on YouTube, and she goes, oh my god, he's a glass bottom boat.  Jay, please put Colin in Reservoir Dogs. 
[00:25:00]  Guys, look, you know, obviously there was a wretch in this whole operation, and I'm no more than  me, and I'm pretty goddamn sure I wasn't here.  I don't know, the guy definitely fucking freaked out in there, but he seems, I don't  know, he seems pretty okay now.  He's a big guy.  I don't know.  I mean, Jesus Christ, you're holding a desert eagle, and he's asking you if you want to  bark all day.  Remember, you know, a guy like that doesn't have one of his, you know, I mean, he doesn't  reach the top floor. 
[00:25:30]  I need to get in touch with Joe, get this guy to the hospital, he's getting blood on my  shoes.  I don't know how finicky I am when it comes to my L.A. gear sneakers.  Andrew Dice walking.  Ready?  Let's try this out.  Yeah.  I got my tongue up this chick's ass.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh.  Crazy.  Hickory dickory dock.  Just talking to my dock. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  After Opie and Anthony live, things have finally calmed down in the studio.  Roland, were you humiliated a little?  What?  No, no.  You're okay with it?  I'm fine.  Rob's very upset with you, though.  Why is that?  Because he said the word fingered.  He doesn't like that word?  That's good to know.  Or ejaculation.  Roland, you did a hell of a job today.  First of all, that was in honor of the great Christopher Walken's birthday. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  Even, that's very good.  But the great Jay Moore may do the best Christopher Walken impression of all.  And that's what that was in honor of.  Roland, you did a very good job booking guests today.  Just like yesterday, a solid guest day on the Opie and Anthony show.  We had Donald Trump Jr. started.  Yeah.  And we weren't sure how it was going to go because we don't have a good relationship with his father.  His father called Opie and Anthony slobs.  Yes.  And on Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter, he wrote before the show, heading to the Opie and Anthony show to talk about Apprentice should be interesting. 
[00:27:00]  Like stepping into a lion's den.  Yeah.  He just told, even told the publicist, he said, I'll go in there and I just won't bullshit the guys and everything will be fine.  So he was ready and they had a great interview.  He had a great time.  We caught up with him as he was leaving.  And here's what Donald Trump Jr. had to say.  Donald Trump Jr., you were on the show today.  Do you feel like you made a friend in Anthony? 
[00:27:30]  I think so.  We seemed a little bit like kindred spirits there.  I was actually kind of surprised because, you know, going in, knowing them from the past and having never been on the show, it's a little bit like walking into the lion's den.  You're never sure what you're going to get.  But, you know, I think we got along quite well.  Your dad, they mentioned it on the air today.  Your dad has a history with them, obviously.  He's done the show before, but he stopped doing the show and he called them slobs.  Do you think you'll be able to smooth things out a little bit after this?  I think so.  Bottom line, you know, my father likes to have fun.  He likes to create a little bit of rivalry, these kind of things. 
[00:28:00]  So, you know, I think he'll come back on just to break their balls.  And you'll come back on, right?  I'll definitely be back.  Perfect.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thanks.  Well, he was a great guest.  And I tell you something.  If you bring up politics with Anthony and you're kind of on his wavelength, you got yourself a good interview.  Is that right, Roland?  Yeah, I mean, he was going left and right about politics and everything.  Yeah, I think he was a little uneasy at first.  He wasn't sure what to expect.  But once he got into it, he had a great time.  He tweeted after the interview. 
[00:28:30]  He gave a little shout-out to Opie, Anthony, and Jim on Twitter and said,  Hey, guys, thanks for a great time.  I look forward to coming back on the show.  And isn't that what you want from every guest, Roland?  Yeah, I like how you're incorporating the tweets now.  You like that?  Yeah.  I didn't realize you were here to give me a critique on this show.  It's like synergy, packaging.  You like that?  Okay.  Well, I mean, I know a lot of people do, and that's what I try to offer.  A big day for me yesterday at the WrestleMania 27 press conference at the Hard Rock Cafe,  Eric and I went down, and we managed to worm our way into an interview. 
[00:29:00]  You what?  Nagel?  Nagel.  What?  No, no, no, no.  A nagel is...  No, he was right.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because if we hadn't gotten the interview, then that would have meant that Eric nageled it up.  But luckily...  We're trying to get positive now.  Like, you nageled your way in.  Oh, you're taking it back?  Is that what you're doing, Eric?  You're trying to take the word back?  I'm following Roland's lead on this one, yes.  Luckily, I was there to talk to some publicists, to grease the wheels a little bit, and I managed  to get us a one-on-one interview with The Rock. 
[00:29:30]  If you missed it, here's a little more.  And also, there was a little editing for the main show, because we go a little more long  for him here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  This was a little bit of the time I had with The Rock yesterday at the WrestleMania 27 press  conference.  We're here at the WrestleMania 27 press conference with The Rock.  The Rock.  No, we're not.  We're here at the Black Swan 2 press conference.  Rock, what's the haps?  On what?  Tell me.  This.  No, you tell.  I'm asking you.  On the haps on this, or the haps on Libya?  The haps in general.  In your life, what's the haps? 
[00:30:00]  In my life.  My life's boring.  Obviously.  Today, we are here at this press conference.  The best part about doing a press conference with the WWE is the energy.  The energy that comes with it.  I think the showmanship, you saw that with all the wrestlers that were here today.  And not only that, but you see that with the fans.  I mean, these fans go crazy, and they go bananas, and I love that.  And that's exactly what's going to happen at WrestleMania.  If we had told, two years ago, if we had told Dwayne Johnson, the actor, that The Rock  would have come back to New York, would that actor have been surprised? 
[00:30:30]  No, not at all.  Because Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, all the same, same guy.  Really?  I had no idea.  Because The Rock talks about himself in the third person.  Well, so does The Dwayne.  Oh, I had no idea.  So, tell me this.  The Miz is involved in the main event.  I talked to The Miz earlier, and I'm kind of convinced that the creation of this character,  The Miz...  Of course.  It's kind of The Rock, no?  Absolutely, yes.  It's only a dumbed-down, lame version. 
[00:31:00]  What do you think of John Cena's rapping?  I think it sucks.  Yeah.  How do you think I feel about it?  Well, I would have assumed that.  I mean, if you say it sucks, it sucks.  You know what I mean?  And finally, you know, we're with SiriusXM.  Do you have any words...  You ever heard crickets bang?  Is that about it?  We're with SiriusXM.  Do you have any words to send to Opie and Anthony, your boys?  Oh, we go way back.  They have apologized to no one for the one bad time, and then it's all been good times since then. 
[00:31:30]  Wait a minute.  Why are they apologizing?  Why are they apologizing?  They just feel bad.  They love you.  I just want to fuck that whole thing up.  That was my fault.  I listened to some asshole.  Anyway, it doesn't matter.  No, those guys are great.  Not only that, but you think about, obviously, being in radio for such a long time, but just  how fucking difficult it is to have longevity in the business.  They're kicking ass.  They're doing great.  Well, you're welcome to stop by any time to see the guys.  Oh, we have some fun.  I did their show, I think, last year.  Yeah, I'm... 
[00:32:00]  Wait, what's the comedian's name who came out of the show?  Jim Norton?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love Jim.  Very funny.  I saw a...  Stop interrupting me.  Fuck!  I saw his concert, and in the audience was Opie and Anthony, so it was good to see them.  They're going to hate that because they hate when they find out that celebrities know  who Jim Norton is.  Oh, they do?  They hate it.  Oh, Jim's one of my favorites.  Very funny.  It's going to make him happy in them.  Yeah, I saw a concert, and Opie and Anthony gave them shout-outs, which was very, very  cool.  Well, Rock, thanks a lot.  Thank you, man.  Appreciate it.  Two notes on that.  Number one, The Rock... 
[00:32:30]  First of all, The Rock letting F-bombs fly as soon as he found out we were with Opie and  Anthony was the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Only second to The Rock telling me not to interrupt him.  Thanks to Eric.  Let it go!  Let it go!  No, don't worry about it.  It's a behind-the-scenes show, so it's okay.  There's a vacuum cleaner going.  Yeah, it is.  For real.  Let it go.  It's Eric's fault.  Yeah.  We're cleaning up the Pop-Tarts now on...  What happened?  How come it went?  Did it get stuck?  Oh, oh, the outlet's bad. 
[00:33:00]  We're cleaning up the Pop-Tart crumbs now.  Now, The Rock mentioned...  What are you laughing at, Eric?  This is how I do my show.  The show rules.  I told you.  I'm a genius.  The Rock mentioned that there was a bad moment...  Or I mentioned it, and The Rock talked about it.  The bad appearance on O&A.  It was many years ago, but a lot of you probably haven't heard it.  The Rock actually walked out of the Opie and Anthony studio.  What'd you say?  I know there's a vacuum cleaner going.  It's after O&A Live.  This is what we do, son. 
[00:33:30]  The Rock walked out of the studio.  Now he takes full blame for it.  But before then, he was blaming O&A for it.  This is how it all went down.  And by the time we get back, we're not going to be vacuuming anymore, probably.  Right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After O&A Live.  The guy on the line that said he went to school with you.  Uh, Chris.  Yeah, Rock.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I was just wondering, when are you going to come up with a new line?  You know?  Don't you think your line's a little played out now?  Uh, no, not really.  Not at all.  You may think it.  Yeah, I think a lot of you think. 
[00:34:00]  But it doesn't matter what you think.  You know what?  Let me ask you another question.  No, seriously.  I got a good line for you.  No.  I've fallen and I can't get up.  That would catch on.  That could be the next one.  That's a T-shirt right there.  Are you going to be moving on to, like, movies, sitcoms?  Do you want to do all that stuff?  I've done a lot of television work.  Well, we've seen the commercials and stuff.  They're hilarious.  Probably this year.  Yeah.  Venture off in a movie.  Right.  Now, you a big Elvis fan?  Oh, yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Can he sing us a line, maybe?  No.  Look at that.  No.  No.  Come on.  The book's got awesome pictures, man.  It does.  This picture of you and Andre DeGine as a little kid.  Let me see.  Look at that.  That's you as a kid?  How'd you meet him, man?  How'd you meet him?  Wait a minute.  That's you as a kid?  It is.  Yeah, easy.  The rock's looking good there.  Wait, wait.  Let me just say it.  Test that picture out.  I could relate to the hairdo.  That's a clue.  That's right.  I could definitely relate.  Was he a cool guy?  Yeah, a real cool guy. 
[00:35:00]  Right after that was snapped, he threw a rock to the floor.  That's right.  It was a memorable moment.  Wow, that's something.  Sporting the fro.  That's it.  During the early days.  Yeah.  Boy, that was a curse.  I remember that.  My hair just like, like a big dandelion head.  You know?  I had the same thing, rock.  I understand.  I know where you're coming from.  You feel the rock on that one.  I feel your pain, yeah.  Dan, you're next with The Rock.  What's going on?  Rock, Opie, and Anthony, what's up?  How you doing?  All right.  Hi.  I want to ask the great one who he looked up to as a kid who was his favorite wrestler 
[00:35:30]  of all time.  Favorite wrestler?  Well, obviously, you know, I looked up to my dad and my grandfather who were in the  business, but I'd have to say probably the entertainers would have to be probably  the Magnificent Morocco, even including Ric Flair as well.  Mm-hmm.  Keep up the great work.  You guys are awesome.  Rock, you are the great one.  I'm not going to bother you with doing any of your tacky catch lines, but I smell what  you're cooking.  God damn.  Hey, Rock, does it ever get real in the ring when you really don't like the guy?  Like you give it a little extra push or something? 
[00:36:00]  No, not really.  I mean, I'm pretty much professional in there, and the rest of the guys in WWF are professional  guys.  Right.  We got an issue.  It'll be handled back in the back and never in the ring, in front of everybody.  Right.  That's just bullshit.  What's your view on...  Whoa.  Hey, there you go.  Nice curse from The Rock.  Excuse The Rock on that one.  All right.  But it is what it is.  That's all right.  If anyone's that unprofessional.  Cursing a book, too.  Cursing a book, too.  What's your personal view on toning down the whole damn wrestling thing?  Because it pisses us off, all these people coming out of the woodwork saying it's too  violent. 
[00:36:30]  Well, it's easy to see that.  It's easy to say that.  You know, on network television, you'll find it a lot worse.  We don't murder people, obviously, on our show.  And a lot of times, our show's reality-based, but at the same time, you'd be an idiot to  think that it's completely legitimate, because it's not.  I remember seeing the boss man getting hanged.  That's right.  That's true.  Wait a minute.  That looked like murder to me.  But then, like Wile E. Coyote, he was back the next day with no problem.  That's right.  I was like, wait a minute.  They hung him yesterday.  What happened? 
[00:37:00]  There's a guy on the line that said he went to school with you.  Chris.  Yeah, Rock.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I was just wondering, when are you going to come up with a new line?  You know?  Don't you think your line's a little played out now?  Uh, no, not really.  Not at all.  You may think it.  Yeah, I think a lot of you do.  But it doesn't matter what you think.  You know what?  Is this it?  You can't even give me a sweeper?  Oh, no.  This thing fucked up.  Well, at least play Ron's music for him.  Okay, we'll do a...  Boy, I don't know what E-Rock is doing in the room.  There it is. 
[00:37:30]  E-Rock's got sticky fingers behind the board today.  He's clogging up all the buttons.  Well, there's a lot of excitement in the building today.  I guess.  E-Rock's all caught up in that.  There's no doubt about it.  He heard my interview with The Rock, and he got all excited like The Rock was still here.  He started...  Sweat on his fingers.  Started mixing up all the buttons.  You are, uh...  You're now in the big, tough-to-get interviewers.  Can't get The Rock.  The Rock is impossible these days.  Yeah.  Who got some?  Uh, the Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart show.  That's right, baby. 
[00:38:00]  By the way, I want to thank Opie for...  Stopping by.  Stopping by today.  He's great.  I didn't know about this Pop-Dart thing.  Well, those are for you.  There's half a box left.  I don't understand why there isn't, uh...  Why this even came down.  What's his Opie obsession?  Well, he, uh...  He comes in every now and then.  He comes in at, like, 5.15.  Uh-huh.  Because, you know, Opie complains on the air that management isn't even here when the show starts.  So every now and then he comes in at 5.15, and when he does, he brings in three boxes of Pop-Tarts. 
[00:38:30]  Rob Cross does.  Now, Rob Cross is the PD of the O&A show?  Because I think it gets very confusing.  I don't know what he does with our show.  I get very, very confused.  I know he's a good guy.  Yeah.  But that's all.  That's about...  We call him the PD of our show, but I don't know if that's true, because I don't know if it's an official title, because he has quite a few different stations.  And I've also always wondered, how could somebody be a program director of just one program?  Wouldn't they just be the...  Sounds like I'd be the program director.  Yeah, I mean, you're the guy who's... 
[00:39:00]  Speaking of which, I'm just, you know, like Rob, I'm not just thinking about myself.  I've got a major, major guest.  Old school friend of mine, Roland, you for one, are going to go, how the fuck do you know this?  I know people, all right?  I got my own past.  Will not be here until the weekend.  I'm going to swing by on the special delivery show.  This weekend?  On Saturday night.  Bring this person in.  I'm going to probably work it out so Hicks does it. 
[00:39:30]  I'm going to go so far to say, if not the biggest star ever in this building, one of them.  This Saturday.  The special delivery show will get press over this.  Trust me.  Is he willing to do like a pre-tape?  No, this is going to be the big break-in where we do my Stone Cold smash and I can walk it in and you guys are just fucking blown away.  Is he just here?  Like, can he do next week too?  No.  Just this, because we're...  This is a Los Angeles friend of mine. 
[00:40:00]  We may be in best of, best of this week.  How can a one show have a best of?  Roland, I mean, maybe I'm old school.  When I came into this business, it was clawing.  It was throwing elbows.  It was, excuse me, is there a shift I could do somewhere?  But is this guy, was he big in the 80s, 90s?  This guy is a legend.  A legend.  Let's just...  Let's say the Jack Nicholson legend, Warren Beatty legend status? 
[00:40:30]  I would put it in that status, yes.  I would say if we were...  I am not saying who it is and who it's not.  I'm always saying this.  James Cullen is in town next week.  When the people who are stars, when this guy walks into a room, everybody gets quiet.  You guys aren't going to be on the show Saturday night.  I mean, it's not a...  It may not be 100% voluntary best of.  You know.  I don't even know what any of these things mean.  All I'm saying is keep an ear out. 
[00:41:00]  We won't be here on Saturday.  It will be a best of special delivery.  If you could maybe...  Do you want to do a pre-tape?  Yes.  This guy does not pre-tape.  He goes live.  Could you just tell him it's live?  What kind of Pop-Tarts we got, by the way?  Blueberries.  I can't lie to a legend.  Roland, you know this.  Would you ever lie to a major guest?  No.  Well, depends.  I don't play that game.  I'm a straight shooter.  Well, while we're talking about lying to guests, we do have one guest that I got for the  Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart show that we got to play real quick. 
[00:41:30]  Go ahead.  Mr. Howie Mandel, are you familiar?  No, I'm not.  Well, just take a listen to this.  I don't always listen to the rock and roll music, so I don't know even what the kids are  up to.  Howie Mandel is...  From Mobbed?  Yes.  From the show Mobbed.  Yeah.  Okay.  He was on O&A earlier.  Here's what he had to say.  Howie Mandel, you did O&A today.  You talked a little bit about the germophobia.  Right.  Is going into that studio in and of itself something that scares you, knowing what they  do in there?  Well, leaving my room scares me, knowing what is happening in the world, so that room doesn't 
[00:42:00]  make it any easier.  You know, the fact that I'm outside of my hotel room is enough, and that's why, if you  listen to the show I talked about, I'm very medicated right now.  At least you're doing something, right?  I'm trying.  I'm just trying to cope.  You've done a lot in entertainment.  What do you prefer doing?  Hosting a show, like a game show type of thing, like Deal or No Deal, or do you like having  an opinion more and getting to judge something like America's Got Talent? 
[00:42:30]  You know, I actually like creating...  My favorite thing is live stand-up, because there are no boundaries, and that's what I  do.  I do 150 dates a year, and I like creating, like the show that I'm doing, Mobbed, that's  going to air tonight.  I like coming up with an idea and watching it come to fruition.  That's my favorite thing to do.  And Mobbed is on tonight after Idle, right?  Right after Idle, so watch it.  Can't wait.  Thanks a lot, Howie.  Thank you.  So we had Howie Mandel...  I was giving you warnings.  This is why I give numbers.  Sting in the morning, sting in the night, sting, sting, sting, sting, sting. 
[00:43:00]  I've seen an old song.  My mom used to sing to me when I was a kid.  I can't believe Howie Mandel made it on O&A.  He was on American Idol last night in California.  No, he wasn't.  He was.  I guess they have airplanes now.  That's pre-taped.  American Idol is?  Yeah, they pre-taped that show.  I'm really naive in this business.  I already know who got voted out.  Who?  The untalented kid.  Actually, two of them.  There's a shocker.  Two of them leave tonight.  Wow.  I can't wait to watch.  So, yeah, we were talking about this while the clip was playing. 
[00:43:30]  So we'll do a pre-tape on Saturday.  We were talking about quite a bit while it was taped.  I can't do that.  You can't.  But maybe I'll have the guy back in again, and maybe he'll do my show.  But it's a weird way that I'm connected to him, and I'm meeting him out for dinner on  Saturday night.  It's not.  And then I thought, we'll do a run in here.  I would love that.  And completely because of Davey Max.  I'm going to give it away.  It's film.  It's a film star.  And because Dave is the only person, I think, in here who will watch a movie 160, 170 times, 
[00:44:00]  this would have been particularly big for him.  But there are other days.  There are other days, and you guys get video game players, and it's just as good.  Howie Mandel.  You got Howie Mandel in the hall, which is great.  Well, can we bring this mystery guest on Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart's show?  No.  Like I said, I'm meeting this guy out for dinner.  It's not going to be even a long night together.  What if we tape something at the restaurant?  I don't like to act like, hey, I'm going to use you. 
[00:44:30]  I act like, hey, we're out to dinner.  We're having fun.  We're almost having drinks.  I'd love for you to see the view.  I got some buddies in here.  Why don't we stop in?  I can't act like, hey, I want to use you for something, because people do that to him.  You know what I mean?  And legends do not do interviews until before noon.  And the thing is, the thing about him is, it was only just going to be like a fun thing.  I wasn't even going to say, I got an interview for you.  I'm like, hey.  Just to hang out.  Drop you by my work.  You can look down at Times Square.  Hey, there's my buddies, Sam and Dave.
