<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about their controversial on-air persona and the evolving standards of broadcast decency.  This segued into insensitive jokes about Hurricane Dean and the perceived unpreparedness of Yucatan Peninsula residents,  with the hurricane being anthropomorphized as slow and capricious. The impending Space Shuttle Endeavour landing was briefly mentioned.  The conversation then took a darker turn, focusing on unsettling feelings associated with houses where horrific events occurred, prompting discussions of ghosts, haunted houses, and anxieties about unknown past sexual activity in such locations.  Caller anecdotes contributed to this macabre theme.

Next, the show delved into the Chris Benoit tragedy and steroid use, followed by the listener participation segments "Rock Scream Tuesday" and "Hummer Tuesday."  The Hurricane Dean discussion resumed, with caller input on residents' preparedness.  "Make-up Stuff Tuesday" followed, where listeners shared fabricated stories, interspersed with the hosts' frustration with dishonest publicists and their failed attempts to secure Terrence Howard as a guest.  A significant portion focused on the disparity in public outrage over drunk driving deaths versus other less deadly events, criticizing the influence of lobbyists and the difficulty of enacting meaningful change.

The Michael Vick dog fighting scandal sparked anger and disgust from the hosts, who discussed the cruelty involved, Vick's potential consequences, and broader issues of animal cruelty and violence.  The cancellation of the Van Halen tour was also briefly mentioned.  A call from Penthouse Pet Justine Jolie concluded this section, initiating a discussion about spanking.

A substantial portion of the show detailed a spanking incident involving Justine Jolie and radio personality Iraq, with graphic descriptions of the event and its aftermath.  This was followed by a segment mocking a Maury Povich show clip about a woman with a pickle phobia.  A significant portion was dedicated to a discussion with the hosts' friend Sam about his restrictive diet and plans to get Mick Foley to help him eat steak and rice, which Foley confirmed via phone call.  A "guess the sound" game featuring a Russian woman feeding many cats and a brief in-studio interview with Luis Guzm√°n were also included.

Another segment featured a discussion about a custom "I love New York" shirt with Louie's face replacing the "I," leading to humorous interpretations.  This led to discussions of Louie's experiences in the adult film industry, including an anecdote about Ron Jeremy.  Jimmy Norton then recounted a graphic description of a threesome involving himself, Ron Jeremy, and another woman, further delving into Jimmy's past sex work and tax deductions.  Discussions about Louie's acting roles in *Boogie Nights*, *Oz*, *John from Cincinnati*, and his opinions on *Lost* followed.

The show returned to Justine Jolie with a highly sexually explicit phone call, revisiting the spanking incident with E-Rock.  The conversation included vulgar banter, detailed discussions about Justine's sex life and body, frequent interruptions, and insults directed at E-Rock.  The veracity of a previous caller's claim of defecating in a bag and throwing it at a window was debated.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a Wired Magazine article criticizing the show and its hosts.

[00:08:00]  little nerve-wracked yeah think of how it feels hmm i come through the atmosphere at a few grand  and uh could just burn up yeah and then you would just get really hot really oh yeah you wouldn't  even know what it's probably got to be instantaneous don't one of those things come apart here we go  doug b from salt lake city they're revving up if you couldn't get a satellite dish attached to your  thatched roof yeah you don't have the means to get out of a hurt out of the way of a hurricane 
[00:08:30]  oh what's going on new uh new information on uh chris benoit yeah they're saying that he  needed the steroids what for some kind of condition he had yeah he needed a lot of steroids for a  condition he was uh he was fighting grotesque when kids are killed or died people put the little  bunny rabbits up by the wall and really it's just creepy eerie stop haunted house who's gonna move in 
[00:09:00]  there now it's a beautiful house probably real dirt cheap now you wake up and the kid's leaning  over your bed like two inches away from you i'm hungry you keep hearing weights just going clang  how many people do you think are living in houses right now and there was some horrific thing that  happened back in the day and they have no idea no idea no idea because the realtors aren't going to 
[00:09:30]  tell you that is always like just the creepiest thing to me well i told you when i was looking  for uh you know to buy a place here in manhattan i went through this beautiful brownstone early on  in the process and i didn't understand why they were selling and uh we went through the whole house  and uh the the mom was very anxious and she's following us and she's like she's needing she's like  cleaning up as we go even though she cleaned up the place ahead of time but she's just straightening up 
[00:10:00]  as we're as we're going along she wanted this house sold so bad i'm like wow man they're they're  a bit anxious and you know the deal when you're dealing with real estate you don't want to look  too anxious yeah you know you're gonna get screwed in the deal right so we leave and then the realtor  i'm like all right what's the deal there's obviously something going on their 17 year old son committed  suicide in that house and i'm like all right next next house so the black light in his room  just splatters all over the place well then i was going back over our little tour and i'm trying 
[00:10:30]  to figure out what room it was in and trying to figure out by i'm trying to remember how she was  acting in each room which room it was did he do it in one of the bedrooms did he decide to be selfish  and do it right in the uh the living room yeah did he do it in the shower i don't know what what  tipped you off like the room you walked into when she covered her face and cried right into the  had to be the room this is this music's too early for our for our fans very creepy this is creepy 
[00:11:00]  people are waking up to this right now i had that house that i uh well me and my family lived in me  my brother my sister and my mommy lived in that house uh in huntington and uh right after we moved  out a guy moved in with his two kids and um they came home from school one day uh opened the door  walked in the the little foyer foyer that i had walked into many times after i'd gone to school  and uh the father shot both of his kids in the head and then shot himself now they were just 
[00:11:30]  bleeding all over my uh floor the linoleum that i helped my mommy put in and the um and the reason  you know this was because it was all over the newspaper and all over tv and you're looking at  pictures of this horrific crime scene remembering when you had a christmas tree in that room great yeah  great times in there but there are people that are living places you know when i was living in  an apartment in brooklyn it's an old apartment you got to figure the room you're sleeping and someone  just dropped dead in there that's why i like new construction although the house that they plowed 
[00:12:00]  under who knows what happened in their indian burial ground yeah something they didn't move  they only move the tombstones  creepy if you're bother you at all it would bother the hell out of me it would bother me yeah i mean  uh sure it would be energy there that i wouldn't like well i wonder what kind of sex people had  like what has happened in this bedroom it always goes to sex with you why we think of horrific death 
[00:12:30]  and you think of sex because i'll tell you why death may not have occurred in any place you're  living in sex almost undoubtedly did yeah so you wonder what different stuff happened in this room  i'm in was it kinky was it loving was it awful was it uh you know but you know what happened  that's better yeah yeah well hotel rooms are great for that too you just never know what happened in a  hotel room dirty i don't like the idea of using the remote and then like grabbing a handful of the 
[00:13:00]  grapes there on the fruit plate and you're like oh the remote because you know after you have sex and  that's the first thing you grab you grab the remote i know and kind of turn on espn not even the first  thing that you grab the first thing you grab is usually either the sheet or some tissues you know  it's just kind of you know what's the matter jimmy tissues tissues you know now they stick no i'm not  talking about really to clean that up i'm just like you know to to maybe something got all right 
[00:13:30]  everywhere okay you know maybe something just an explosion save yourself a cleaning bill yeah yeah  and just so you don't have to you get it back into bed and go ah you know and then those go flying on  the floor because you know someone else has got to pick them up i don't care yeah but you don't but  then you grab the remote and maybe there's something on your hands you don't feel the weird energy when  you go through a house and uh wonder about uh what kind of sex was right done in that that's true  i feel weird i definitely feel weird energy in houses absolutely i never had that feeling and 
[00:14:00]  like obviously old houses in particular and you would say well old houses are creepy to begin with  and that's why you feel the energy i don't feel it in every old house no no but i definitely feel  things in certain houses i'm like let's get the f out of here i didn't look at that many like when i  looked to my place it was just a few places i i looked in and i didn't really get any weird  vibes in any of them no same thing with houses i didn't get weird vibes i got like this place  sucks yeah no there was a place on uh riverside drive old uh very old building that they redid 
[00:14:30]  completely and i walked through that place and i was like no way are we living here and it was  beautiful but i got a vibe in that joint and and then they told me that yeah the building's at least  150 years old a lot of stuff happened they redid the whole thing and i swear to you i felt it  energy that i was like probably some whoopings given in that no in that place it was just creepy  i just got like that the hair was standing up on my arms and stuff yeah there was something going on 
[00:15:00]  there my brother like lived in a haunted house he's he swears to it back up there in white plains  he swears by it faucets going on in the middle of the night doors slamming all sorts of crazy crap  isn't this very like it's easy to confirm how come people like i was haunted bad and only me  if they were real like i love these paranormal jackasses that go into these places with all  kinds of machinery and don't find anything yeah that's a good point but i mean when you're living 
[00:15:30]  in that situation you have no doubt in your mind you know yeah but okay then why wouldn't you just  run video all the time well maybe uh maybe it doesn't get picked up by the video oh stop that's  what i camera shy ghosts maybe ghosts maybe they're union actors yeah why do ghosts have paid why do you  have to see ghosts just because that's how it's uh portrayed in movies no but you would see some kind  of weird activity happening like there was something that was the creepiest damn thing and it was 
[00:16:00]  obviously some kind of gimmick but it was uh when webcams first really getting popular and a lot of  people were uh just going on the chick webcams the college webcams things like that but there was one  it was a haunted house cam and all the cameras were black and white and you could go to various rooms  in the house and just look at down the hallways like and then they had the basement and the crawl space 
[00:16:30]  was one of them and it's like a lot of people have reported seeing a white uh see-through figure  uh moving at the end of this hallway and you'd look at it and i'm like i can't look at this because  if i see something i'm gonna drop dead i just cannot take anything like that creepy cameras you're  switching around to different rooms this room was you know uh used as a nursery and the baby died and 
[00:17:00]  there's all kinds of weird stories in there and i just could not look at these cameras yeah i wouldn't  be able to do that let's say hi to joe in rockland county joe what's up good morning boys good morning  joe i got a funny story i work for con edison down in the city and we're in basements and people's  houses every day and you would be amazed at the sound and the energy you feel in somebody's home  i totally agree with old yeah you go in somebody's houses and and it's just like you go in these dark 
[00:17:30]  dingy basements and you see like shadowy things and and noises you hope you pray it's just a rat  because god forbid it you see something it's like ah you're out of there you know look i i don't i don't  know what it is but i definitely feel an energy in in some houses yeah when i go through them i i just i  know that i don't know what the what it could be maybe uh maybe there's too much electricity being  pumped through the house because it's old i don't know i don't know what it could be but i definitely 
[00:18:00]  feel creepy feelings in certain houses yeah mine's just this fear i agree with you it's scary mine's  just fear i'm a baby when it comes to things like that i was doing a job once at this uh huge like  oldest state had to be 180 years old and they were renovating it and turning it into a country club  somewhere on the north shore long island and we were the first ones in to pull out old uh uh  radiators and um copper piping and things like that and uh it was just me and two other guys on 
[00:18:30]  our crew and this huge place so we went exploring around the place and it was four like four stories  with these spiral staircases and huge stairs and and uh big rooms with fireplaces and it was just a  beautiful estate but it was abandoned for so long that you'd open up these rooms and and wonder what  happened in them over the years and uh just getting there early in the morning where it was still kind 
[00:19:00]  of dark and you're just there with your flashlight oh so scary so goddamn scary just because if i saw  anything that's it and i'd be i'd be walking just going please don't see anything don't see anything  because you'll go crazy do you they'll just lock you up in an institution if i saw something like  that just put me in the mental ward yeah because i'd just be freaking out and why are we so scared  like it goes you know you're not going to lose a fight against a ghost how do you know the ghost  is going to punch right through you don't want to see this you don't want to see like 
[00:19:30]  here it is here it is  i feel what what is it oh what was that  anthony anthony anthony come with us walk into the fireplace no i would freak out let's see the 
[00:20:00]  ghost can't kill you he can with fear with you up all night too rattling causing a ruckus a ruckus  i'm trying to sleep what a ghost would do is like every time it piped up you out would you shut up  and just got really you weren't afraid of it you just hated it all right right already i heard  boo i get it that would that'd be funny it got me it would probably really piss the ghost off  just this guy's unscarable just turn a really big fan on because it can't hold its form 
[00:20:30]  blow away now what are you gonna do without those bones and skin being haunted by fog right  chris what's up hey uh i wanted to tell you i had worked for a demolition company uh in in brooklyn we  were um in charge of opening up walls so the asbestos group could get in and it was in uh an abandoned  building in kingsborough psychiatric so every day we would come in because there was no power in the  building i shut it all off and it would be one outlet that we could find way down in the mechanical 
[00:21:00]  space and we would hook it up you know two clips hook it up and and pretty much do most of the work  from this one freaking outlet uh we would come in the next day and the outlet would be care the uh  wires from the outlet would be carefully removed and laid on the floor and the two wire nuts laid  right next to it so every time we hooked it up in the morning we would come back uh that the uh at the  evening uh they would come back the next morning and the thing would be completely disconnected it was 
[00:21:30]  probably the job super so a fire wouldn't start or something just meddling kids  unbelievable all right that's not really a good ghost story though that it actually helped you  helped in fire safety help put the tools away i came back my truck was washed  i was horrified all right chris thank you yeah but chris is convinced something was going on what  can i tell you yeah why don't we take a quick break here drew boogie yesterday he said in the bob  kelly remixes uh he took some puking sound effects from from bob puking during the what the hell is

[00:23:30]  there's no real reason it's just we're guys it works though it works like the lawyers say we can't  talk about that anymore either of course no of course not don't be too detailed with that one  how about what's in your pants we play that no of course not because we all know what's in there  yeah dirty stuff no we can't do that anymore dirty stuff's in there that will offend people  i think we're gonna make a list of all the stuff we can't do anymore that we used to do 
[00:24:00]  a mere four or five years ago that would be a big long list a very long list but hummer tuesday's  alive and well ladies if you know what i mean if your man's a fan of this show you know what to do  and then he goes what was that for and you go hey it's because you listen to opie and anthony  yeah we could say that much right absolutely also it's far away phone call tuesday  let's get a phone call from the yucatan peninsula that would be nice because that hurricane is 
[00:24:30]  slowly but surely making its way to land it's hitting land you know in this day and age  i don't get it i just don't get why you wouldn't get out of the way of a hurricane back in the day  of course all of a sudden you're just surprised why look why do you think those people have televisions  well they're in mud huts there's no windows yeah they don't have windows all those hurricanes  well uh we got some guy from his mobile device actually russ from alabama he writes if you carry 
[00:25:00]  green on your head and then he does in the vince uh voice you need to get out you need to get out now  what are you doing there why are you still there you you gotta get out of there why didn't you leave  you're gonna leave it's your fault it's your fault follow me you got to the airport  i don't understand why people are still waiting to leave they should have been gone a while what 
[00:25:30]  what are you still doing there why are you still there you're gonna get blown away you're gonna get  blown away by the big wind coming from the hurricane and you deserve it  you should have left days ago but not you were just stupid  get the hell out get the hell out now get the hell out now

[00:27:00]  this yeah with fake ufo sightings and all right and remember the alien getting run over by a truck  driver we say it very early yeah we say it very early then we don't say it again so if you're  listening to this part of the show you're in on the joke and basically it's uh makeup stuff tuesday  so later on also we'll take a phone call from somebody and if it sounds uh somewhat believable  we will just go with it yeah and see where it takes us and we won't even question that you're  telling a fib and then anyone tuning in uh later on that didn't hear this part of the show i think 
[00:27:30]  it's real yeah see but you got to make it sound real because if it doesn't sound real we can't blow  up the the bit so we'll call you out and make you look stupid by calling you a liar yeah we'll just say  you're lying why would you call up with something that'd be good stupid there's consequences but the  reason why you're calling up was because you heard that we're uh asking for people to make up stuff  yeah later on so today maybe uh terrence howard's publicist can call in and say yeah he can't call  in thursday because he's gonna be on the set at six in the morning we can go okay that's that sounds 
[00:28:00]  right and we'd say what a bunch of crap that is no no no it sounds like a lie today we'd believe it  yeah well you know to all the public it's all the publicists out there that are booking guests for  our show we just we just stop lying to us we're not buying your stupid lies anymore we're supposed to  obviously have terrence howard on our show and uh we got an email from roland this morning that uh  he's got to reschedule because they need him back on the set they don't need him on here but see he  he was scheduled for our show yeah so at that point terrence needs to do something and give us a quick 
[00:28:30]  phone call and go guys i know i was supposed to call you and uh do a little thing but i i really have  to get back on the set just want to acknowledge that you guys are human beings and i'll be in i'll be  back on your show soon but instead we get some stupid lie from some stupid publicist  yeah they had no intentions of having terrence howard on our show be in new york for the his  premiere of his film tomorrow night and then the next morning he was supposed to do a phone in to  here yeah what possible set could he be on if he's coming to his premiere and then what what are 
[00:29:00]  they flying him out during the after party because he has to be on what do you think we're idiots yes  oh they do it's a quick phone call while you're getting your dumb makeup done or whatever we're  going over your lines if it was true but it's not true it's not no i know so i would rather have  the publicist go look you know terrence howard just you know he doesn't want to even be seen with you  guys or in or in print with you guys or any of that crap so i'm sorry we we kind of lied and said we 
[00:29:30]  would get you terrence howard because we really wanted you to take our our d-list celebrities yeah  that's how they work i don't think it's even even the artist man it's very it's usually dude it  never gets to the artist terrence howard has no clue he's supposed to be on our show thursday  yeah i'm convinced of that so to the publicist stop lying to us we've been at this game a very  long time now i'd rather be told the truth instead of some some weird lie that he needs to be back on  the set yeah i've had enough of having to like be like be nice to like you know you don't want to 
[00:30:00]  piss them off and it's like i think they've got us some cool guests but who have they gotten us that  we were like we had to have i can't think of anybody they've gotten us that we've had to have that we  couldn't have gotten yeah i thought ozzy was a must get but that wasn't the publicist it's always  these publicists the publicists that think uh we're doing them a favor and and if we screw around with  the guests and they get angry uh they have all the the power to tell us to go screw well in this 
[00:30:30]  situation how about they go screw enough with the publicists done when i see them peeking through  peeking through that window over there oh you want to just hit him on the head with a frying  flip him the bird i say say none of them in there we could say they gotta wait in the green room yeah  they're not allowed to even look and then they uh they act like they're doing us a favor no we have  a huge audience we're doing you a favor yeah this isn't a college radio show you know we'll do 
[00:31:00]  your sounds like one if you if you take this nobody and these two nobodies from a film that's  going to go direct to dvd and if you take these guys starring in a reality show that's no that no  one is watching on tv then we'll give you terrence howard go screw yes no more favors  yeah hey by the way anthony uh brought up something in the office i did that is quite  quite quite interesting uh in the last year thirteen thousand four hundred and seventy 
[00:31:30]  people died died because of drunk driving ah because of drunk driving if thirteen thousand  five hundred people died of anything besides smoking uh that seems to be another thing most  people don't really care about but uh uh probably more people die because of smoking by the way  yeah absolutely probably way more but this is more of a like kind of violent innocent a lot of 
[00:32:00]  innocent people involved in in drunk driving accidents as opposed to people that are smoking  i know the secondhand smoke argument but i don't even want to get into that it's just people you know  that are smoking consciously smoking cigarettes uh you know they want to kill themselves whatever  they kind of know what they're doing but when you're drunk and uh you're you're hammered to the  point where you cannot even function in an automobile and you're killing people uh thirteen thousand  five hundred people since when was that from this is in the last year jimmy per year now here's the 
[00:32:30]  here's the point and because we bring this up from time time time to time these stupid politicians  out there that go after violent video games we were talking about beavis and butthead yesterday uh  one one kid what burned down his house because of the fire episode we were just talking about  yesterday so what do they do they have to uh just beavis and butthead and make it completely safe  because one stupid kid did something stupid yep uh the politicians go after the soft uh you know this  the soft the soft causes yeah you know they wouldn't they would never take this head on 
[00:33:00]  no no pun intended by the way it's very difficult to and uh i don't think they want to make really really  strict rules about it because a lot of people drink and then drive this is a crime that a lot of  regular people can get in trouble for it's not like you're not going to go out and murder somebody  the average person is not going to be like you know i have the potential to just go out there and  start killing people uh but that's something that oh my god ah you might have a few drinks you get 
[00:33:30]  arrested if they if they up the penalty a lot of these people in congress and stuff they  they drink and drive they do and and then they could be put behind bars for a long period of time  if they increase the uh the penalties for these things i don't think you're ever going to see it  the point i'm making though i mean they'll go up to the violent video games and it'll be all over tv 
[00:34:00]  hillary clinton we need to get rid of the violent video games you know but this uh this little uh  stat hit the press today 13 500 drunk driving deaths last year it'll it'll barely be mentioned  on tv but the next violent video game that that pops up or uh or a rap song with violent of you know  lyrics that's a big thing but also what i was i was thinking is like uh you get the bridge 
[00:34:30]  collapse now now you're up to 13 people dead and there's this calamity now to check the bridges  check the bridges in our country uh 13 people tragic especially for the families jesus christ  it doesn't matter if it's one person uh that that family is going to be very upset but um looking at  it statistically very cold uh just looking at it like that it's not that many people uh not that many  people die in bridge collapses per year uh but there's a this clamor now to inspect all the 
[00:35:00]  bridges fix them oh my god like it is a big catastrophe if anything else was killing thirteen  thousand five hundred people uh randomly like that there'd be a huge outcry or some kind of  cause a backlash you make a great point i mean maybe another seven people will die because of some  bridge uh collapse uh this year if maybe and that's stretching it so maybe a total of 20 people 
[00:35:30]  this year school shootings they're tragic right tragic again the families devastated but again  statistically looking at it very coldly and statistically uh you're not even coming close to  thirteen thousand five hundred thousand people we lost uh three thousand uh people uh on september 11th  uh tragic uh tragic 13 000 people thirteen five they're getting stricter though man i mean like 
[00:36:00]  in the last few years they've come they've cracked down as far as like but you know what mandatory jail  time really falling they said well it fell from thirteen thousand uh seven hundred and uh to thirteen  thousand five sixty it's like that isn't really a drop off that could just be a uh yeah hiccup in the  statistic but it's it's even though the penalties are getting stronger people are still killing  people like that on the road how many how many deaths because of video games and i don't think 
[00:36:30]  the yeah none but they go after video games like it's like like it's i don't think the solution  is stronger penalties because people want to drink and drive they want to go out and drink and then  they got to get home so they drive some people are a lot better at it than others uh some people  for some reason uh don't even know they're going down the wrong way on an expressway or it's it which  amazes me or a freeway how you get on the off ramp and spin around the wrong way and then head into 
[00:37:00]  headlights well when when drunk driving laws are passed you're talking to sober people who are who are  pretty judicial and prudent those are not the people you need to impress on you know yeah you  got to talk to people when they're hammered like maybe make them blow into something and if they're  too drunk to drive the car doesn't start yeah that'd be nice yeah something like that um well i've always  been for the drunk driving test uh people aren't uh really rallying behind me on this one where you pay 
[00:37:30]  money you take a special test where you uh you drive and you drink and you drive and then uh you have a  certain level and when you're impaired that's your level some people's level can be way down to one  beer and they're gone you rock i want to take the test because i know i'm good oh my god this is the  audio your license your license you should be able to turn over the cop can you know you you blow into  the uh breathalyzer you blow like a point uh nine or uh some you know something some some ridiculous 
[00:38:00]  number oh eight oh nine point point one and uh you're rated at a point one two and they go okay  you're free to go you're you you you're very good at this this is the audio they're gonna play someday  on the news that's the that's what i want because and it's not because of the high-end people it's  because of the low-end people there are people that cannot drive after two beers they are completely 
[00:38:30]  gone babbling running into things well the point i'm making the the attention on this  no attention today for the most part but you know like you said bridge collapses violent video games  all this other stuff gets massive attention like it's an epidemic you know sweeping across america  when the real epidemic is 13 500 people are dying in drunk driving accidents and that's only the people  that died how many how many drunk driving accidents that are there a year and injured and dismembered 
[00:39:00]  you know things like that a school shooting happens like you said it's it's absolutely awful but it's  not an epidemic like this yeah this is but the politicians will take on all that other crap because  it's easy yeah it's so easy to take care of that crap because you know taking care of drunk driving is  a very complicated thing very it's an extremely complicated thing the liquor lobby's huge the uh  uh the booze uh sales in uh this country are giant it's a huge economic boost the uh the bar industry 
[00:39:30]  big syntax on it yeah huge syntax on booze i mean they tax the crap out of liquor right and cigarettes uh  so yeah it's it's it's something they don't want to do away with they tried that once with the  a prohibition best commercials man they're awful commercials oh hate them i know what you're  talking about videos of little kids home videos oh god and then at the end they tell you okay we'll 
[00:40:00]  feed you soon oh look at my precious open up a christmas present and then it's like you know  yeah little kathleen oh that's so well and it's like they show a name driver killed by drunk driver  they show the death date great thank you that's what we came up with as a gene yeah it's a great  you know what i say huh show ugly kids people won't care yeah people don't care as much about  ugly children as they do cute ones hey you don't think of that when you're watching the video though  like i know well he had a kid's ugly you're crazy uh pnc bank art center banned all drinking in the 
[00:40:30]  in the parking lot because two stupid people died from drugs and booze during os fast i'm reading this  this is gut shot drew yeah how'd they die uh they o.d man it's 80 arrests too though i think that was  the problem yeah 80 arrests 80 arrests and a lot of arrests but how many shows have they had over  the years where they've had no problems there's always one probably yeah two or three probably not  many where they've had no one but i'm sure most of them are not this bad like an eagles concert 
[00:41:00]  there's probably one guy yeah yeah yeah there's no problem with the eagles concert i don't understand  the mentality like one or two people wreck it for everybody i mean everybody because just like you were  80 just like you were saying though anthony i mean you know you could go to a concert most  people listening to us you go to a concert have a few beers uh whether it's before the show during  the show they cut off the uh the alcohols you know sales uh giving you enough time to kind of sober up 
[00:41:30]  and you and you have no problem you're enjoying a few beers and you're enjoying your favorite band  on some people don't know moderation well one or two people don't know moderation and they they  eff it up for everybody i'm sick of that cowboy games you can't get booze after the third quarter  or after halftime or whatever a lot of this it's like there's no other legal thing that has so many  stipulations with it like with alcohol you can only have this much before you drive uh you can't fly  12 hours after you have this yeah you don't have this stuff after halftime but it's legal but it's  completely legal it's the biggest cause of domestic violence it's the biggest cause uh i would say 
[00:42:00]  right substance of deaths on the highway and it's so protected no one pisses me off about so highly  no one pisses me off about that whole uh you know cutting off the alcohol during sporting events it's  it's a fake we care it's a fake responsibility we're showing a fake responsibility here because  most people aren't going to sober up uh in an hour and a half after you cut off the alcohol sales  again it's caused by people getting hammered uh leaving the stadium killing people and then the 
[00:42:30]  people's family uh sue the stadium so again the lawyers got involved and said we gotta kind of  make it look like we're making an effort to get these people home safely right but jim is absolutely  right it's legal uh if you're over 21 in this country it is legal to drink wherever and whenever  the hell you want and uh but there are so many restrictions on it why you gotta ask so why because  it is a dangerous item you will be stopped randomly around holiday weekends yeah police 
[00:43:00]  will make you breathe in their face to make sure that you have not drank too much of this legal  substance because if you do you'll kill a family of eight yeah yet you can buy it everywhere you can  you can you can just pick it up drink it hop in the car and start driving there you go  cigarettes kill a lot of people at least that's a self-induced yeah only how about smoking kills  400 000 people a year wow there you go politicians take on that one we need that though take on we do we 
[00:43:30]  need that this country would just be packed oh we kind of need it for population control things are in  place to keep people in check imagine an extra 400 000 people a year in this country christ they'll  ban smoking in our lifetimes the fda they'll find a drug reason to do it the fda they'll find some kind  of a legal reason to say that they that they ban it again a lot of money yeah but they're moving 
[00:44:00]  none of that not only the cigarette tax but i mean the medical industry the drug industry the money they  make off of the fact that people smoke and get uh emphysema and cancer and and whatnot and that is  all is amazing that's all uh taken under consideration i'm reading this book and uh  no you're not yeah i read and this author is uh saying imagine if there was a pill where you could  take it and you never have to eat again and you would stay at the exact weight you are they're in 
[00:44:30]  cyanide you can stay at the exact weight you are be completely healthy but you don't have to  deal with just eating on a daily basis yeah how great would that be and you think about being  this guy that's kind of cool like you would never feel hunger you would never have like all you  wouldn't crave sushi or whatever you crave a steak yeah and then he explains how that would completely  destroy the earth yeah because of the farmers and everything that goes into you know producing food 
[00:45:00]  industry and i mean that's a ridiculous example but it's not too far off from what you were just  saying about the smoking yeah we have a balance if also you just took smoking away  the economy would be affected throughout the entire world it's 400 000 extra people uh so you  have to worry about them there's the the medical industry is is going broke because a lot of their uh  medicine is based on people that smoke and have lung problems no because the first of all smokers  are compulsive smokers are compulsive so when you take away cigarettes i'm an ex-smoker we eat we 
[00:45:30]  drink we do something else oh so it's not about the cigarettes it is about filling the hole so if  the cigarettes are gone okay i won't get cancer but let me shove food in my fat feast until my morbid  obesity did i say feast i was thinking obesity what did i say show food in my fat feast in my fat feast  i have a big fat feast you know i don't know what you boys are laughing at it wasn't an error 
[00:46:00]  sorry it was my fat feast because you're feasting as you fill up your mouth i know i was going to  obesity but i'll shove i'll shove a lot of uh feed into my fat face and then uh wind up uh needing the  medical industry for something else it'll it won't be as yeah you think it'll balance out not quite  balanced but it won't be as bad as you think yeah gastric bypass surgeries and all that but i think  that's neat i think that's why nothing gets uh accomplished quickly everything has to be phased  out slowly but surely yeah so the economic effects aren't that great quick is like revolution like 
[00:46:30]  everyone not everyone but there seems to be a movement in this country to go to electric cars  yeah you can't just like do that tomorrow no you would destroy the economy everyone gets an electric  car tomorrow that's why that's why we'll never see anything drastically done in our lifetime yeah  there's things ready to happen but they're like they look at the economic effects and like uh  we gotta slowly fade this out and slowly bring in the new technology that's gonna hurt we gotta  adjust the factories and we gotta yeah find jobs for these people that are gonna be out of work and 
[00:47:00]  like think of the um the lowly tv repairman whatever happened to the tv repairman  used to be a huge industry in this country people would at tv would break they'd call the tv repairman  he'd come over and fix your tv put some tubes in there or something you don't get that anymore  you go you have tv breaks after a few years the things are amazing now and you you kick it to the  curb and you get a new one and that's it so so that part of the the business is dead but now people 
[00:47:30]  are buying a lot more tvs wouldn't it be funny like if you find out like one people once in the  industry kind of phases out what the people who used to do that do and and so it would still be  awful like all tv repairman now like dig up bodies and like just throw them around graveyards  they just have some awful activity  wow you used to you used to repair washing machines what do you do now i bludgeon the elderly 
[00:48:00]  i work for the government i bludgeon the uh elderly well there used to be milkmen right  a milk truck but these are all glass bottles would come to your house and put it in this stupid box  in front of your uh uh in front of your house but these are of course dad called her mom yeah the  wife but these are all small ruined it these are all small things going away what i'm getting at if  you took like a major thing and just like it you know it goes away tomorrow yeah the effects would 
[00:48:30]  just destroy you know the economy there's a lot of paranoia about the gas companies oh the cars  electric cars will never get made because the gas companies are too powerful but i was watching a  thing just like a guy was speaking and he was like the ceo of exxon mobil and i was like i mean it's not  common knowledge exxon mobil is a company but i'm like there are two different gas companies like  yeah why why don't you just go to an exxon mobil station but we're so dumb me included i'll go to  mobile like i don't like exxon i'm gonna go to mobile it's one company it's one guy right 
[00:49:00]  all right we gotta take a quick break brilliant you've discovered status quo craig from new  england well what does that mean what's craig from new england mean by that it's it's just keeping  things the same yeah oh so you keep the economy kind of floating on a level where we can all kind  of like uh survive we're not discovering it we knew it was there we're just saying that we're just  bringing into today's conversation there's an effect to that right it it it keeps things from 
[00:49:30]  moving forward yeah moving forward it it keeps things moving slowly i read another book where  we're supposed to be so much further advanced than we are today i saw movies where we're far advanced  but i mean what but they just slowed down they slowed down all progress because of status quo and and  this and that but someone figured out we should be a 200 whatever it was i was going to just throw  out a dumb number that means nothing but i'd say 200 like we're supposed to be so much further along 
[00:50:00]  now we have the technology i figured out this is what we know and this is what we could be doing with  it but we just can't like just you know skip ahead that fast we have to do it nice and slowly and nice  and gradually flying cars flying cars sure mylar suits i'm thinking uh rocket backpack rocket pack  rocket backpack gotta make it cool don't forget the industrial revolution was like a couple hundred  years ago we're doing pretty good i mean we started off you know like for a thousand years they were 
[00:50:30]  just using metal tools and now all of a sudden a couple hundred years after this thing happens and  we're on the moon and we can like you know transplant your spine and you know possibly grow like you  know new flesh and look at porn on computers that's wonderful there you go by the way last thing  before i need to go to break but you said the milkman what they've done now is they all work for a  duffel bag company and they make hollowed out bottom duffel bags for child pornographers to smuggle dvds  i was reading a big article in music on that it was a huge article right as long as they're doing 
[00:51:00]  something with themselves i think it was on the uh it was the cover story i believe yes it was you showed  a milkman raising his hands like what do you want me to do get a hat to the milkman on it all  right we gotta take a quick break here it's opie and anthony  you're checking out opie and anthony gotta love pal talk uh 
[00:51:30]  tom walked in and say good morning and steven s from basher obviously saw him on the cam  the pal talk camera he writes tom c is a category five boracane boracane  can i say that uh yeah michael vick took part in the dog executions oh yeah yeah yeah that's what  they're saying like little dog geese people are saying if you're like the guy who runs the 
[00:52:00]  property and you're making money off it all right that's bad yeah but if you're actually  hands-on with killing the animals that takes a certain type of violent streak in you like a  serial killers usually start out killing animals and being very cruel it shows a lack of respect for  life uh this guy's just a scum we all know what he is but hey no i mean you can't say less yeah i 
[00:52:30]  know it really is just just a a way i don't know who's defending this guy i've seen a few people uh  teammates i guess defending him uh it's ridiculous and and it's not just the dogs i i don't get there  are some dogs i would like to chop their heads off too great yeah no not the greyhound yeah they're  very regal looking dogs i'm thinking yorkshire terriers really i want to twist off a yorkie's 
[00:53:00]  head no because they're just yappy dogs shut up i don't like greyhounds and any dog that weighs less  than two pounds like a yorkie a yorkie is less than two pounds what are the ones that are really tiny  with teeny little legs as as as as as small as this sharpie like a nice big dog you take it out  in the snow and it runs like gallops through the snow and then you get a little chihuahua and they  lift their feet up like they don't know how to stand on it you just want to tee them up and boot 
[00:53:30]  them just what a pig this guy is though no love for these animals how could you how can you just shoot  and murder dog i don't get it man and i it's like another just a jerk off alpha male jock i hate jocks  yeah i just hate them just a bunch of dummies they all want to be funny their idea of being  funny because they're too fucking stupid to say anything whoa whoa whoa 715 wow i was like 715 
[00:54:00]  you're throwing the f-bomb jimmy that was a knockout punch right there that was probably  that would be picked up hopefully al got that wow did i say it did i we're gonna say goodbye to  al after this week by the way it sickens me oh al's leaving us they're just too stupid jocks  in general this is the mentality that too most of them are too stupid to say anything funny so their  idea of being funny is putting tape on a hairy kid's back and ripping it off or pulling your  underwear up going they're dopes yeah fighting dogs and then and then setting up dog fights and then 
[00:54:30]  killing the dog they showed some of the dogs uh that were involved in this that were alive  with their faces all chewed up completely like chewed up but killing them like if they didn't  perform well yeah test fights yeah like what kind of a savage does that to a dog get rid of the weak  ones he's in deep that's a strong one yeah so he's pleading guilty uh what can he get i i hear 18  months i hear five years well he won't get five years he'll probably get he'll probably get a year and 
[00:55:00]  i don't know what maybe he'll be out in a year or six months but and then community service along  with that it's gonna hurt him badly uh it's gonna oh yeah his career is done i think why would you own  the why would you own the land in your own name i mean how stupid is that loan a guy a few bucks tell  him to put it in his name you don't put your name why don't you just put a big like falcons helmet on  the front gate come on in idiot he's not the smartest uh guy here's the question he's a huge star 
[00:55:30]  obviously in the nfl he's gonna plead guilty he's gonna go away for a while what does the nfl do  when he gets out of jail do they allow him back in hell no you think he's done like the nfl says no  effing way we could have damaged goods depends on i don't know man these guys let you in after  shootings after drugs it depends on the gambling allegations because that's how they'll keep him  out gambling yeah because there's a there's something in the contracts that say any kind of  gambling you're done man the three major sports are all effed up right now legal gambling anyone 
[00:56:00]  else notice that you got baseball with the steroids you got the michael vick situation in the nfl you  got the you got the ref who's now saying that there's like what what was the total 20 other  refs that might have been involved with this whole gambling thing maybe got hockey with the boring  thing hey hey hey i love my hockey except the islanders suck because they trade away their whole  god damn team in the off season uh invalid media from cleveland ohio whatever that means  all the tv repair shops in cleveland are now heroin dens jimmy oh because you're asking about uh 
[00:56:30]  well you guys were trying to figure out what uh what these people that had this nice little job  what they're doing all the oldie times they had these little jobs that just kept them in business  and this guy sent this in my uncle was a tv repair man he's now an alcoholic  good for him he found something else he was good at and we and we babbled for 20 minutes and what  we were basically trying to say nice person from whack bag wrote it in uh perfectly for us video 
[00:57:00]  games don't have lobbyists to defend them booze and the tobacco industry does and that's why the  politicians will not go after the really tough tough tough yep tough things in this country to take  on the lobbyists politicians just suck it's also very tough to like to defend violence in video  games as an adult thing makes sense but none of them will defend pornography and none of them will  defend that because well with violence with kids you can't come out on that let's keep it in perspective  there's millions and millions of people playing the violent video games and they're not doing 
[00:57:30]  anything after they they're actually relieving stress i believe it actually helps you i agree but the  politician will say oh it's getting everyone rattled and then then they go out and and commit real  violence do they really how much what percentage i would really like to know the percentage it's  fun it's like a movie that you get to play in things like that and as an adult you shouldn't have  to worry uh about goddamn kids being affected yeah i want to play it because i'm old enough to play it 
[00:58:00]  yep you dummies but everything has to cater to the children these days everything we're all a bunch of  wussies over here where every everything all adult type entertainment has been just ripped from us  because a kid might get his hands on it screw them that's when you smack them across the face and go  don't touch that but you said you did as a kid do as i say not as i do that was one for my old man  he used to say that a lot well dad i saw you do it do as i say not as i do and how do you argue that 
[00:58:30]  one but but damn it he's the dad so you should do the but but but but all right listen he is i'm  sorry he's what happened they said his endorsement empire is taking him he's obviously no one's going  to use him well they stopped making his jersey little shelter nike reebok have all yanked into  oh he is losing millions of everything for what like for what how much could he have possibly made 
[00:59:00]  in a dog fighting it wasn't about the money though right what was it about about being just a barbarian  and not caring that you're murdering innocent animals or just being indifferent to it just being a  jerk-off just being a jerk-off in a pen with a bunch of other jerk-offs throwing money at these  animals watching them kill each other just awful yeah it wasn't hand knives to each other and just  stab each other that i would pay to see is that because is that because we were like dogs are our  our friends animals rely on us because we we just massacre there's a cow holocaust going on we eat 
[00:59:30]  them though it's not done for cruelty i mean maybe it's barbaric when they kind of sick the way you're  saying that we eat them well look dude you can't play fetch with a cow that's the difference  how just cow just stands there stand there and put his tongue in his nostril it's sleep standing  up unless there's a storm coming and then it sits down look what is that about they i've said it  before they won't leave a building if it's on fire cows are of no value yeah i think we should behead  them even when we're not eating because they're dumb yeah i'll slap a cow's face repeatedly and you 
[01:00:00]  can't get a cow fight together you ever try to get a cow fight they both stink they just stare at each  other and and their bottom jaw moves as they chew their cud they just stare and go bottom jaw left  and right left and right it's just like and then they occasionally shove their tongue up their nostril  and then chew some more what do you think the get him get him they both just all right the first one  that stops chewing his cud loses what do you think is going on in that dumb cow brain nothing chewing 
[01:00:30]  away nothing i wish no i don't i think i'm no i'm not is that a butterfly i think that's a  butterfly  is that shoe that cud dummy heads all they hear is some dumb noise that means nothing  to no they don't know if they're being milked or slaughtered or punched as they're getting  electrocuted so we have juicy steaks and burgers their blood pressure doesn't even go up no it

[01:14:00]  uh at the at my my house oh and he thought you guys were going to the movies yeah we were going  to the movies or playing monopoly or something and and the second his work truck would pull away we'd  hit the bedroom and just stand there the entire time uh until 15 minutes before she was ready to be  picked up and then it was cleanup time and then uh drop her back off at the house i i've dropped  back off with her dad her dad was like that guy that drives around the stripper for the bachelor 
[01:14:30]  parties that's yeah no idea no clue that was going on but uh that was it i remember once um i did  something uh to her that she had never had done before actually i believe she had never had anything  done before but uh then i i decided to do something a little special a little special where um which one  do a little bit well it's uh the uh the um thing where i wouldn't be able to talk during 
[01:15:00]  it ah oh yeah ah i wouldn't be able to speak during it ah because that part of my body's busy  okay you know that sure and um yeah it was very good she uh she uh enjoyed that but then i asked if  there was any way and it was very hard for me to do this uh i don't know how i worded it but i wanted a  little reciprocation right on that you know right thing and um for some reason uh uh she was all shy 
[01:15:30]  about it okay and she goes well me and my friends have talked about that but i never did it before  and she said uh uh my friend said i should practice with a banana ah so you can practice with this right  here it doesn't matter right the practice end of it is uh still doing it you went around you went  about it wrong the way to do that yeah is to go and when she looks over go open up whore and then run 
[01:16:00]  at her just run at her no it was uh it was uh you know a girlfriend situation it wasn't just a  uh you know i know i know chick so you talk to him kind of thing that's the way you talk that's  the one and then i remember briefly speaking with the girl that i tased on uh any w remember oh yeah  tracked her down she called in or something yeah and uh yeah i had built a little taser from radio  shack and was convinced it didn't work because nothing i built could work possibly so i hit her with it and 
[01:16:30]  she hit the floor i felt bad i tased my girlfriend  all right hey uh look well supposed to uh be on the show he's coming in he's coming in in what 15  minutes yeah louise guzman guzman guzman guzman from uh boogie nights he's doing uh jill tv right  now he'll be here a little later yep very very cool hey uh we're still waiting for justine jolie to  call in we can't get her on the phone she promised she would uh check in today around 7 30 so far we 
[01:17:00]  can't uh get her on the phone so probably asleep so we're standing by on that one uh we gotta  finally play pickle phobia we've been talking about this for over a week oh from maury's show  well we couldn't get to it because we uh got busy uh with other things um and we had maury in and  this is what we were talking about he goes oh if you think my phobia shows are great with the birds  and the cotton cotton man cotton ball man uh you gotta play pickle phobia yeah i've never heard this 
[01:17:30]  by the way girls afraid of pickles and maury tries to cure her in his inimitable fashion which is  just uh getting as many of whatever items someone's afraid of right and pretty much throwing them out of  and uh it's it's a it's no cure it's just uh maury being a prick absolutely so let's uh check out  mariah she describes her fear of pickles this is what the sight of a pickle does to mariah 
[01:18:00]  my name is kaya and i hate pickles i hate everything about pickles are destroying my life people take  fun of me i feel ashamed that i'm actually afraid of them when i think about pickles i just want to  throw up and run away what i hate most about the pickles is the shape the texture of it the color  the shape and the color all right oh boy you know that's she's afraid of something else i mean 
[01:18:30]  the thing yeah just covering up the real fear there uh maury sends her to a pickle factory  why not we wanted to see firsthand the extent of mariah's pickle phobia so we sent her to the  patterson pickle factory where she would come face to face with thousands upon  thousands of pickle of pickle  i don't know 
[01:19:00]  She is losing her mind. 
[01:19:30]  She's a lunatic.  Nice, strong girl there.  Yeah, that's her at the pickle factory.  Look at the pickles.  Look at the pickles now.  You look at those pickles.  You're afraid of pickles?  What's the matter with you?  Pick up that pickle.  Go on, pick it up now.  You're going to eat it.  You're going to eat that pickle.  Go on, pick it up and eat it. 
[01:20:00]  Angry Vince McMahon in the house.  What a dolt.  Maury asks why she's so afraid of pickles.  Good question, Maury.  Let's see if we get the answer here.  Good question.  Where did this all start?  When I was really little.  I couldn't stand them.  You couldn't stand them?  No.  Well, a lot of kids don't like pickles.  And they just don't like pickles.  But they don't look.  I mean, just because I should.  They don't do this.  Huh? 
[01:20:30]  You've got to get over this, right?  Huh?  Do you have nightmares about pickles?  I used to.  Stop it.  Stop shaking.  Thank you.  And you're a waitress?  Yeah.  In a restaurant?  Aren't there pickles around?  Yeah, but I'm nowhere near him.  I'm nowhere near him.  I love Maury.  He just knows how to handle these situations.  Stop shaking.  Stop shaking.  Stop shaking.  Stop shaking.  Stop shaking.  She's scared, you dummy. 
[01:21:00]  That is the worst thing to tell somebody when they're shaking.  It's impossible to stop shaking.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't even notice I was shaking.  All right.  I'll stop right now.  No problem.  I'll stop these involuntary muscle spasms I'm having due to complete fear.  Right.  Your heart is beating?  Stop beating.  Yeah, Maury does sound like a baby shaker in that clip.  Right, right.  Stop crying.  He's shaking a baby. 
[01:21:30]  There it is.  Stop.  It's turning blue.  They sure will never.  Never.  Maury, of course, has to bring out a giant plate of pickles to cure Mariah of her pickle phobia.  It's helpful.  Look at the one pink one in there.  He comes in with a platter.  On his lap.  Yeah.  Pick out the pickle that doesn't scare you.  There's one in there that shouldn't scare you. 
[01:22:00]  Get a good one.  Just sitting there with the pickles on his lap.  Get a good one.  This one's filled with strudel icing.  Jesus.  All right, here we go.  The giant plate of pickles.  Shakia and Louise have confronted their phobia.  They didn't like it. 
[01:22:30]  You're going to have to confront yours.  You've got to see a pickle.  Like, why do they have to confront their phobias?  Because it's Maury.  Dr. Maury.  Dr. Maury, you're needed in psych.  Is this in a medical journal somewhere you've got to confront your fear on a talk show before  they go to commercial and move on to something else?  Confront yours.  You've got to see a pickle.  No.  Can we have a pickle, please?  No.  Or two.  Oh, my God.  Or two.  Or 25.  God bless the listeners. 
[01:23:00]  When we can't think of the obvious, they're right there for us.  Phil in Minnesota, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if her uncle was new for it, no.  There you go.  You've got to see a pickle.  No.  Can we have a pickle, please?  No.  Or two.  No.  Or ten.  Or ten.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:23:30]  Stay there.  Stay there.  Stay there.  Mariah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Mariah.  Where's Mariah?  Where's Mariah?  Where's Mariah?  She's running around the audience hiding.  She hid under someone's seat.  Then the pickle man started coming after her there.  So then she ran all the way to the back of the audience.  Now she's down the hallway here.  Mariah, where's Mariah? 
[01:24:00]  Where's Mariah?  You know what they should do?  They should put, like, when they want to run and jump off something, they should put,  like, a thing of hot oil that they set on fire and just watch these idiots jump into  it.  She can't go anywhere.  No, they're running, and they just don't see this on the other side, and they go to,  like, get away, and they just fall into a pit of burning oil.  We all laugh.  Mariah, you're on fire!  Where's Mariah?  I don't have anything. 
[01:24:30]  I don't have anything.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You just, you have to confront them.  You know, Gary's going to have to, you know, he has to understand where you're coming from,  all right?  Okay, let's go back on.  Let's go back on.  You don't like the smell of pickles either, do you?  Okay, here's your shoe.  Where about the other shoe?  Where's your other shoe?  There's a pickle in it.  We're taking them away. 
[01:25:00]  Can we get our other shoe, please?  Is it up here?  We'll get the shoe.  Here's your other shoe.  How many shoes does it have?  Pickles?  And there you go.  She lost her mind.  That's great.  Maury doesn't care.  We can't get enough of the Maury Phobia shows.  Well, our own Sam is going to be confronting his fear on Friday's show.  Yeah, is it a fear?  Does he have a fear of steak?  Hamburgers?  I think he just might. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  There's something going on with him.  Sam will be eating steak for the first time in many, many, many, many years, right?  Never.  You've never had steak?  No.  You've never had steak?  No.  What a little sweetie.  That is weird.  I think you cut up a little steak for the babies, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did you never have steak?  That amazes me.  Is it the stringy texture?  He doesn't know.  He's never tasted it. 
[01:26:00]  So you don't even know what...  No, because chicken has, like, stringy texture to it.  What is it?  Like, what would you think if you put it to your mouth?  I don't think it's anything specific.  I think it's just steak is one of the things that I don't eat.  I just would have a reaction to it that it's not something I want.  It's delicious.  It's not going to be good.  I don't want it.  See, this is why I'm not a good parent, because his mother was like, well, we just found one.  Oh, I know.  I would literally let him sit there and starve to death.  That's why I'm not a parent.  I can't do it.  Yeah, I wish my mom... 
[01:26:30]  Like, Mommy Dearest.  I would never lose that argument.  It's not raw, Tina.  It's rare.  And she had to sit there for three days with that rotting piece of meat in front of her.  Three days?  Yeah.  She kept putting it back in the fridge and said that she won't get anything else to eat  until she eats her steak.  And it was raw.  And she would sit down at the dinner table, and then Mommy Dearest there, Joan Crawford,  would put the same steak.  Well, now it's starting to, like, rot in front of her, and she wouldn't eat it.  Did she eventually? 
[01:27:00]  Nope.  She won.  The mother, she finally just said, okay, throw it away.  Wow.  And Tina got up and smiled like, I beat you.  Did she really win, though?  No.  No.  She made the movie, that one.  It was embarrassing for Joan Crawford.  Yeah.  Great movie.  So, Sam, as you know by now, Sam eats like an eight-year-old.  Don't worry.  We're not going to ask you what you ate last night, because we know it's chicken fingers.  Little pizza.  Elio's pizza.  Elio's pizza.  Some weird dessert only eight-year-olds eat.  And nuggets.  And a glass of milk. 
[01:27:30]  We get it.  We know.  It's weird the things he'll accept.  Fish bakey.  That's not what I call it.  Did you have fish bakey?  Did you have fish bakey last night?  I will always call it fish bakey now.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I had fish sticks last night.  We already know.  But we found out after talking to Sam's mom yesterday that, yeah, Sam's a happy boy, and  she never pushed it because, you know, Sam's happy.  And she's right.  You look at Sam, you know he's a happy kid.  Happy boy.  But we're going to feed him steak and rice.  For some reason, he hates the texture of rice, the peel of the wash. 
[01:28:00]  His mother said he had rice once.  She kind of held his mouth open and threw some rice down there.  I like that she was a little tough with you at times, like grabbing you, pinning you down,  and putting you on the roller coaster, and then holding your mouth open and shoving rice  in there until you puked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That did happen.  So, uh, hold on, Sam, for dessert, do you want some sweet potato pie?  I say that we have to have a steak, rice, and a squash, and then for a birthday, for 
[01:28:30]  your, for dessert, it's sweet potato pie.  You want sweet potato pie?  No.  Doesn't that sound delicious?  Apple pie.  He hates apple pie, too.  How about mincemeat pie?  How about some shoofly pie from the Amish?  We'll get you some Amish.  You want some rhubarb?  It has to be apple pie.  He hates the apple pie.  Rhubarb.  I hate apple pie?  It's an American meal.  It's good, though.  You don't like any pie?  What is it about pie?  Because there are so many different types, you can't just lump them all.  They all taste different. 
[01:29:00]  That's probably the texture.  The flaky crust.  No, no, no.  I eat pie crust.  Like a pie.  But not the delicious filling with tomato.  I won't eat pie filling, no.  But you'll eat fish guts that have been battered in fat.  Processed fish guts.  Chicken fingers.  I saw that on a show, How It's Made.  There's this boring show called How It's Made.  I love How It's Made.  But you're just compelled to watch it.  I know.  It's not a boring show at all.  You know, it's an industrial film.  They then roll the paper into tight bundles where I'm falling asleep, yet I'm captivated. 
[01:29:30]  I love this show, yet I hate it.  I could watch that show for hours.  They show it out and they make fish sticks.  And it's just fish pouring in and then being ground up and smushed through these things  that make little cubes out of them and then breaded with crisp crumb coating.  Crisp crumb coating.  I can't see it like that.  They make it into nice shapes.  Yeah, shapes.  Fish bakey.  Here's the dilemma that Sam has.  So I know he's not just going to eat steak and rice, you know. 
[01:30:00]  And squash.  Because he's kind of stubborn.  He's stubborn when it comes to all this.  And squash and all that crap.  And sweet potato pie.  And sweet potato pie.  And sweet potato pie.  But we also know that Sam's a wrestling fan.  So now here's the dilemma.  We're going to have Mick Foley come in on Friday and cut up the steak nice and small with  a little kid fork and feed our own Sam steak and rice.  How great will that be?  How great is this?  Mick Foley.  He's a great dad.  Now you can't say no because you've loved wrestling your entire life. 
[01:30:30]  And it will be from the palm, which will be real food.  You're not eating crap.  We're not getting your garbage from a table.  No, it's going to be a good steak.  It's going to be a delicious steak that we're all eating on Friday morning.  Yes.  It's like a $50 or $60 meal.  So you're in, right?  Because Mick Foley's going to be feeding you?  He has to be.  Playing choo-choo and all that?  Or airplane hangar, as Anthony likes to call it?  I hope Mick Foley's good with the fork.  Where he's like, open your mouth.  Here it comes. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, he's not too happy about this.  Do you like orange juice?  Yeah.  Okay.  You're going to have a real interaction with one of your wrestling heroes.  You realize that?  He'll be feeding me like a small child food that I'm probably going to gag out.  Yeah, puke out.  I can't wait to see his reaction.  He's never had steak before.  What if he eats it and you enjoy it?  He won't like it.  What are the odds that you might enjoy it and add it to your diet?  But that's the thing.  Do you like salt?  Yeah.  Okay.  You put a lot of salt on it and you'll probably like it even more.  You put a lot of salt on it? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, you can.  You'll like steak.  Salt is good on steak.  You can't not like steak.  You really can't.  And then you'll love the sweet potato pie at the end.  Yeah, what if he likes the steak?  Well, if I like the steak, then you still will get your moment when you try to make me eat rice.  You'll enjoy the rice, too.  It's good.  No.  It's good for you.  Rice creeps him out because it's like bugs or something.  I don't know.  Yeah, we're going to get to the bottom of it someday.  But that's on Friday's show.  We've got to take a break here.  But Mick Foley will be feeding Sam steak and rice and sweet potato pie. 
[01:32:00]  And no, don't forget the squash.  And the squash.  Summer squash.  He might like summer squash.  Summer squash.  Summer vegetables suck.  I hate summer vegetables.  All right.  Guest is out today.  We're going to try to figure out what this is after the break.  What is that? 
[01:32:30]  Give us a call.  877-212-O-N-A.  I know what it is.  What is it, Jimmy?  It's a man with big metal shoes stepping on kittens while crinkling tinfoil over his head.  Is that correct?  That's what I was going to say.  Is that correct?  His big metal shoes.  Oh, we'll find out after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're in the middle of guest to sound on the Opie and Anthony show.  In the middle of, I have to watch when Opie pushes the buttons down. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, I've got to figure out a new system.  No, I was watching.  And I said the BJ word right when you hit the buttons down.  And Sam went, oh, jeez.  Did it go over the air?  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  Not even close.  I know.  Ow!  We'd get it down the hall.  Yeah.  Here's the sound for today. 
[01:33:30]  I know it.  Yeah?  Somebody making cat popcorn.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Listen, that's the sound coming out of the dryer vent over at the little shelter.  Some people use tennis balls.  Marge uses blind, three-legged cats to fluff up the pillows.  Poor Marge.  Leave Marge alone. 
[01:34:00]  Let's go to Neil in Boston.  Neil, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  That's kittens in a hurricane.  Kittens in a hurricane is the sound today.  Could be.  Thanks, Neil.  Neil's listening on BCN, and if you are listening on BCN, wake up!  It's kind of like a steamroller using kittens to fill a pothole.  Because it was that roll sound and then popping, which I would assume is a kitten's, and then  the mewing, mewing of the unpopped yet kittens. 
[01:34:30]  Getting ready to be molded into the highway.  Hey, I said wake up to BCN, people, because Jimmy's going to be making an appearance up  there this Thursday.  I'll be on Touch Red Rich during the day, 4 o'clock at BCN.  I'm doing my last happy ending signing, I believe, at Barnes & Noble in Boylston Street,  in the Prudential Center, I think.  Boylston.  6 o'clock, yeah.  6 p.m., and Club Soda Kenny will be there.  He's asleep.  Kenny, what's wrong?  You're awake?  Oh, look how sleepy he is. 
[01:35:00]  He was actually sitting there.  He was asleep.  I saw he's been asleep through the whole break.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's been nodding off.  Oh, Kenny.  Now he's scratching.  He was up last night.  He's scratching his head.  Case of homosexuality.  Just confused and sweating and turning.  Why do I think these things?  I keep remembering when I saw it at the gym.  I could control everything else in my life, but I can't control these dreams I have.  I can't control these thoughts.  My urges.  He has to go to rest areas and just yell at men that tempt him. 
[01:35:30]  Get out of here.  Instant feedback like crazy coming in here.  For just a sound, Ben C., he writes,  It's Marge losing her mind and smashing her way through the wretched cattery.  The cattery.  Mike M. from Boston.  Does that sound Marge?  It's all about Marge today again.  Does that sound Marge getting overrun by the cats because they're sick of her taunting them?  They're sick of her taunting them. 
[01:36:00]  Possibly with some kind of fish smell.  Oh, kittens in a room full of rat traps.  Nice.  That one just came in.  You got Rex from Houston.  Guess the sound.  A cat rendering plant.  A cat rendering plant making cat bakey.  Cat bakey.  And then you got Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Marge taking off her underwear in the cattery.  Oh.  Can we hear that again?  Because I think I know this one.  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  Is it a man eating ice cream?  Hmm.  Man eating ice cream.  Eating ice cream?  It certainly sounds like that.  Mom.  Let's go to Josh in Brooklyn.  Josh.  There's kittens in there.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, I know.  It's a cat bowling alley.  A cat bowling alley? 
[01:37:00]  Yes.  Is the suggestion.  That's okay, right?  Ah, no.  Why don't we get the answer so we can move on?  Yeah.  Here's Jason.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  It is a crazy old bat hurling food at her 400 cats.  Yeah, some Russian lady feeding 130-some-odd cats.  That's what that is.  130, maybe more, cats.  Some Russian lady just kind of walking around her house just dropping food. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, that's so great.  And what you hear is the tapping of the paws.  Little pads?  Yeah, going after the food.  Is that where she lives?  In her house?  Yeah.  Listen again.  They're jumping off all surfaces to get at the food.  A stampede of cats going after the food.  Is there a video of that?  Is there a video of this?  Iraq.  Iraq. 
[01:38:00]  Wow.  That is a cat.  That is a cat.  Boop all over.  That's a cat feeding frenzy right there.  Yeah.  Is that amazing?  Can't crazy cat people just have one that they're really nice to?  Just one nice cat.  Like Jack-Jack.  Little white paws.  He's got little white paws.  He keeps them so white.  And his little white belly.  That's what he does.  And he loves to play. 
[01:38:30]  Holy ass.  Here's the video.  Crazy Russian cat lady.  If you go to YouTube today.  Wow.  Look at them jumping around.  I'm sure Al will have this link on the show rundown on 923krock.com later today.  Wait, start from the beginning there, Iraq.  I know this is radio, but...  If one more IM pops up, I'm going to ask you to move it.  Alright, so she opens the door.  One cat jumps at her immediately.  Jumps about three feet off the ground.  She now closes the door.  She's in some kind of bathrobe.  She's a Russian lady with a yellow bag. 
[01:39:00]  And now she's just throwing food all over the room.  And they're just going nuts.  The crap must be everywhere.  It seems like she has them all in that one room, though.  Yeah, you know what?  It seems like this was set up for a nice video.  Yeah, I agree.  Maybe for a TV show or something.  Because the room looks too clean to have 130 cats in it.  Yeah, a bunch of cats.  Look at that.  They're just going completely nuts.  Like a feeding frenzy with 130 cats.  It would be so great if they jumped at her throat and just, like, ate her. 
[01:39:30]  I'd pet them.  Would you pet them?  Yeah.  Under the chin?  And they put their head up.  Yeah, let's go to George in Baltimore.  George.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I've seen the video online, too.  It actually says it's a two-bedroom apartment that she lives in with 130 cats.  Downstairs neighbors must.  You know what?  Love that.  I'm not buying it.  I think it was just set up for the video.  I mean, 130 cats in my room.  Steve, real or fake?  I'd say fake.  Steve? 
[01:40:00]  Steve?  Okay.  I'm real.  Steve is saying real, which means it is absolutely fake.  Well, the actual video is real, but it's a setup job.  No, CGI.  CGI?  Yeah.  Hey, speaking of videos, don't forget to go to Break.com today.  There is an amazing face plant.  They're calling it the ultimate face plant.  The ice skating one?  No, no.  This is the bike trick that they're showing all over TV today.  Ice skating is great.  The guy goes over a ramp.  Go to Hardest Face Plant Ever, the first video. 
[01:40:30]  He lives, right?  This might not be the one they're showing up.  Who cares?  You're right.  This guy goes over a ramp, unless this is a different one.  They really don't.  Oh, this is a different one.  They're showing one on TV today.  A guy goes up a ramp with his BMX bike.  Wait, here's the...  That kind of hurt.  He lost teeth on that.  He jumped off a roof with his skates.  Yeah.  No, but the one they're showing on Good Morning America, we got the big TV on behind Anthony.  A guy goes up a ramp with his BMX.  He's trying to land on the roof of his house. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  And his face catches like the gutter.  Wham!  And then he goes backwards.  Nice.  He goes backwards.  They don't spend much time on character development on these clips, so you really don't care about the person.  No.  There's no storylines here.  No.  I could give a crap.  We just watch people do horrific things to themselves.  They go, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Well, they're hoping something goes wrong with these stunts.  If they complete the stunt, it's not as impressive as getting injured.  Hey, Wired Magazine, what is their problem with us? 
[01:41:30]  We might have a job for the Pest if the Pest want to get involved here.  The guy's in Denver.  He's in Denver.  Wired Magazine, they're talking about the new rating system for radio.  What is Wired Magazine, by the way?  It's like tech.  We've been featured in Wired Magazine.  Many, many times over the years.  I'm not sure if it's so much Wired Magazine or Steve Knopper.  Knopper.  All right, hold on.  Wired Magazine is going to have to wait.  We got Mick Foley. 
[01:42:00]  Oh.  Calling in.  Mick Foley?  Yes.  How are you, sir?  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  Yes, we can.  Can you hear us?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  That's a phone call.  That's a phone call.  Mick Foley is going to be part of the whole Oney Traveling Virus comedy show this Saturday at  the PNC.  Nice.  We can't wait for that, Mick Foley.  Yes.  Neither can I.  And you're going to come in on Friday to help us out with a bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand.  I have quite a challenge on my hands.  Yeah, we got Sam. 
[01:42:30]  He's a huge wrestling fan.  He eats like an eight-year-old.  And we're going to feed him steak and rice for the first time on Friday.  And squash.  And squash.  And from what I understand, I'm going to attempt to personally feed him.  Well, we figure, Mick, you're a good dad.  We figure you kind of know these things.  None of us here, we're all inept.  We don't have kids.  We just don't know how to do this.  You seem like a guy who, and he does idolize you.  Okay.  Well, that's where he differs from my kids. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I haven't done anything right in several years.  That's just a touch of reality for you when you go home, huh?  You've got all these kids that love you everywhere you go,  and then you get home to your kids, and you're just dad.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Worse than that, I wanted to show my younger kids what I used to do  because they were claiming I was a stinky wrestler.  So I put on the DVD of me beating The Rock for the championship way back in 98,  and my kids actually started booing me. 
[01:43:30]  But I can make them eat.  So this is where I have an advantage because Sam idolizes me,  and I am a dad, and I will make Sam eat.  Yeah.  If you have to, just punch him in the face.  Yeah.  And don't be confused.  Sam is 23 years old, but you've really got to treat him like he's one of your little kids.  Yeah.  We want all the motions you would do with the little fork as you're trying to get him to swallow the steak.  Like, what would you do back in the day there, Mick?  Probably go with the fork becomes like the little airplane. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  And here it goes.  Airplane.  You know, make the noises.  And if that doesn't work, I will resort to violence probably.  Put a little rice on the end of your fist and plant it into his mouth.  Yeah, plant it right squarely in the middle of his face.  I'll do what needs to be done.  You make him eat that rice.  Make him eat it!  Mick, we're having a good time with Angry Vince McMahon on our show.  Angry Vince.  You can't get enough of Angry Vince. 
[01:44:30]  So, uh, did we find out who Vince's son is yet?  No, I keep hoping I'm going to get the call and find out it's me.  You think it could be anybody?  Well, we found out.  Oh, wait, wait.  Sam, yes?  It's a boy.  We found that out yesterday.  It's definitely a boy.  It's a guy.  Okay, so we don't have to worry about any of the girls.  And he's a current wrestler.  Yes.  In the WWE.  Yes.  Wow.  Well, superstar, so.  Yeah.  I'm going with Stone Cold.  That's my personal.  You think Stone Cold?  They do both have bad attitudes. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, but they have that great history, you know.  And for those of you who were watching the show a while back, you know, there was a time  when I considered Vince to be a father figure.  Right.  So I think it would be a great way to ease me back onto the show in a regular way.  Here comes the airplane, Mick.  Full of food.  You're going to eat it.  You ate that food.  That's right.  Put it in your mouth. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Well, Mick, we just wanted a quick call to make sure you're in as far as this bit goes.  Because if we just gave Sam, like, a really nice, and it's going to be a really nice steak,  I'm telling you, he will not eat it.  He would refuse.  But knowing he's a huge wrestling fan, now he's got that dilemma, and he's going to have  to do it now.  Yeah.  And just show it.  Maybe if it's a great steak, get a second one.  Right.  So that I can eat side by side with it.  Oh, believe me, you are cordially invited.  There will be plenty of steak for everybody on Friday. 
[01:46:00]  Yep.  All right.  Thanks to the, what, the palm rice?  The palm.  They make a good steak there, Mick.  Fucking quality.  All right.  Well, I'll come up with some tactics, and like I said, if need be, I'll use physical force.  All right.  Anything else?  Everything else all right with you?  No, everything's great.  I'm looking forward to this.  We get the traveling virus on Saturday night that I'm looking forward to being a part of,  and then our SummerSlam is the next day.  Yep.  So it should be a great weekend, and I'd like to get it off to a great start. 
[01:46:30]  By having a complete success on my hands on your show on Friday.  That'd be good.  The highlight of the weekend.  Yeah.  Not SummerSlam or anything.  No, it's feeding Sam steak.  Feeding Sam tiny pieces of steak.  That's right.  As he plays airplane hanger with a 24-year-old or 23-year-old.  Yeah.  Who acts like an 8-year-old.  Right.  And for dessert, he wants sweet potato pie.  Yes, he does.  All right, Mick.  I may even rework the infamous green eggs and ham story. 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  Our Sam.  Oh.  There was a story about a guy who wouldn't eat only because he didn't know what it was  that he was being asked to eat.  Mm-hmm.  But there's an incentive.  Sam, I am.  Well, you like children's books and stuff, so maybe we'll have you read a little something-something.  How's Christmas going for you, Mick?  Christmas all year, I celebrate it, so it's good.  It's good.  And I bet that was a cool thing with your kids when they were younger, but now they're 
[01:47:30]  like, what's wrong with Daddy?  What's up with this Christmas thing in the basement all year round?  They still, I think they're still traumatized.  They couldn't figure out why they could play with the choo-choo train upstairs, but downstairs,  like, they'd go near the Christmas train and be like, that's not a toy!  That's not a toy!  You stay away from that train!  For the people that don't know, Mick Foley really does have a Christmas room in his house.  And when you have young kids, it must be the coolest thing ever to just go downstairs and 
[01:48:00]  see the Christmas room in the middle of summer.  But now that they're, how old are your kids there, Mick?  They're like 15, 13.  Wow.  Yeah, now they think Daddy's just crazy.  Now they think Daddy needs to talk to somebody.  Yeah, I mean, especially, you know, I had the talk, you know, what, you know, you guys  don't necessarily know what the talk is, you know, but with the oldest one, I had to explain  to them that I understood there were certain things that teenage boys did, and that I, you 
[01:48:30]  know, and that I, it wasn't like I was saying, you can't do that, but I did tell them, you  can't do that in the Christmas room.  All you need is more tinsel.  Certain urges, but God forbid, I catch you doing that stuff down here in the Christmas  room, it's all over.  I have a feeling you're the only one enjoying the Christmas room in your house at this point  in your life.  You're just sitting there.  It's supposed to be the special occasion room, and I used to even lock it when I was  gone, but the room was a good TV, so I come home and nobody obeys the no eating in the 
[01:49:00]  Christmas room rule, no watching TV when Dad's not there, so I guess everyone's got to have  a, you know, now that I don't get beaten up for a living, I've got to have some type of,  you know, psychological problem.  How about you turn it into a sports room or a, your own personal strip club?  It's over, Johnny, with this Christmas thing.  It's Christmas.  It's nice and wholesome and family-oriented.  A little bit.  Yeah, I'll put a pole, a stripper's pole in the corner, and we'll have guests appear. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  But anyway, we can talk that over, but look, I'm going to, I will be successful on Friday  when I come see you guys live.  All right, and by that, you mean you will be able to feed Sam steak and rice for the  first time in his life.  I believe I will, yes.  All right.  Thank you, Mick Foley.  See you Friday.  All right, I'll see you in a couple days.  Right on.  Cool.  There he goes.  Good friend of the show, Mick Foley, everyone.  All right, hey, Luis Guzman is, he's here in the green room. 
[01:50:00]  Oh my God, we've got to take a quick break and talk to him.  And we'll get into this Wired Magazine thing, I guess.  Yeah.  This guy has a problem with us for some reason.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Show's flying by today.  We got Luis Guzman, sorry, making his way into the studio.  Mick Foley was just talking about the big comedy show this Saturday at the PNC Arts Center  out there in Holmdel, New Jersey.  All the comedians you know and love from the show. 
[01:50:30]  The tour is wrapping up.  This is one of two dates left.  Right now, we got a pair of tickets to the Buyer's store at the PNC Bank Arts Center on  Saturday, courtesy of Blades of Glory on DVD, in stores everywhere, Tuesday, August 28th.  But we'll give away a pair of tickets to a random caller right now at 877-212-O-N-A.  Luis is coming to the studio.  How you doing, man?  I'm good, brother.  How you doing, man?  Very good.  Very happy.  I was looking at your resume. 
[01:51:00]  I didn't realize you've been acting since 77, man.  You've been like a long, good career.  Well, from 77 to, I think, 85 or something, I didn't do anything.  It was a fluke.  You had a one-shot deal there?  It was a hobby.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What happened from 77?  Because there's something called short eyes.  Then in 83, I was going to ask you, actually, because sometimes when somebody's starting  out, there's big gaps.  Well, I'll tell you what, when I did short eyes, it was because my buddy wrote that movie.  It was a play first, and then they made it into a movie, so he came to the block and picked 
[01:51:30]  up a bunch of the guys to be background back then.  So I wasn't pursuing being an actor back then.  I was a social worker on the Lower East Side.  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  Social worker.  And you just lucked out, kind of?  You got discovered by your buddies in the neighborhood?  Well, what happened is, when I did Miami Vice years later, I ran into the same guy, and  he said, hey, they're coming to town, why don't you see if you can get a part? 
[01:52:00]  So I got me a part, and all I wanted to get out of it was enough money to buy me a used  car so I could drive to Orchard Beach on the weekend.  That was it, for real.  Do you train, or are you just one of those guys who's just a good actor?  I think I'm a good actor.  You didn't go to acting school or any of that stuff?  No, actually, I studied for two years, but that was right after I got in the business.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then that probably seemed like silly training.  I was like, I know how to do this naturally.  Really, I didn't know what I was doing, so that's why I took classes for two years, just 
[01:52:30]  to sharpen my tools and stuff and my skills and understand my instincts a little bit better.  Did it work, or did you think everybody was an ass in there?  No, it worked.  Yeah?  I'm here talking about it today.  Yeah, I thought it was more of a natural thing, though, than trained.  Well, for me, it was, I mean, really, I didn't train to become an actor.  Like I said, I just wanted to understand the craft a little bit more, because, you know, 
[01:53:00]  I used my whole life, growing up on the Lower East Side, is my reference, you know?  Yeah.  And the Lower East Side used to be a really scary place.  It's slowly turning around, but back in the day, man, there was some crazy ass going on there.  Yeah, man.  Well, you know, back in the day, it looked like a bomb hit the neighborhood.  Yeah.  Why a social worker?  Like, usually guys go into social work after, like, you get sober, or after, you know,  things go really bad, then all of a sudden, like, all right, things are okay now.  Was there a reason to be a social worker, or were you just kind of, it's just what you 
[01:53:30]  wanted to do, or was there, like, a terrible story behind it?  Well, I've always liked helping people help themselves, you know?  And, you know, that was my calling, you know?  I love doing it.  I love working with young people.  I really love seeing people turning their life around and taking charge and stuff.  And, you know, like I said, the whole acting thing was a fluke.  You know, I didn't expect that to happen.  I just wanted to get a used car out of it.  It's interesting you say that because you don't give that impression in your roles. 
[01:54:00]  That you would actually care about people turning their lives around.  Liking people.  You care more about throwing people downstairs.  You could have been nicer in Carlito's way.  But, you know, the thing is, like you mentioned, Carlito's way, I grew up with guys like that.  So, you know, when I'm able to portray guys like that, I say, okay, you know, this is  my reference, this guy that we used to hang out with in the back room of a social club  at 4 or 5 in the morning shooting pool.  You're in one of my favorite movies of all time, and it's a movie that never got to play 
[01:54:30]  it should have gotten, Q&A, with Nick Nolte.  It was directed by Sidney Lumet.  But it's an amazing film.  Nick Nolte is this, like, really weird, homo-ironic, like, rogue lieutenant who likes trannies.  It's just the greatest bad cop story ever.  Timothy Hutton, you know, a little dull.  But, I mean, the rest of it was a great movie, and you were great.  He plays one of the detectives.  You and Armando Asante had a great scene together.  Yeah, yeah.  That movie never got to play it should have gotten.  But I've been a fan since way back in, I guess, was it 87 or something like that.  Yeah, no, that was a great movie. 
[01:55:00]  You know, actually, it was written by the same guy that wrote Carlito's way, Edwin Torres.  Oh, really?  He wrote Q&A and Carlito's way.  Was that Sidney Lumet's daughter that played?  And I know this is kind of weird for people who haven't seen the movie, but there's Sidney  Lumet's daughter, I think, plays the role.  Yeah, Jenny.  Yeah, she's kind of a new actress.  But, you know, when you saw the credits, you're like, well, that's kind of an odd casting.  And then you see the credits, and you go, ah, Lumet.  Now I get it.  Yeah.  Never a, never, any aspiration of being a leading man or anything like that? 
[01:55:30]  Because you were one of those guys for years was like, oh, that guy.  Yeah.  Oh, that guy.  And then you just start to get your name out there where people now know your name.  Well, you know, I mean, if that, I'll tell you what, I'm just happy working.  Yeah.  You know, I'm happy doing good roles.  I'm happy doing good films and stuff like that.  And good material comes in my way.  So I'm just, you know, a happy-go-lucky camper, man.  But you are one of those guys that was like J.T. Walsh or Craig Nelson or a lot of these  guys.  Yeah.  Everybody, you can't go anywhere. 
[01:56:00]  People go, I know you, I know you, I know you.  And then like Frank Vincent, too.  Raging Bull, you know, Goodfellas.  And all of a sudden, the name, one role, and all of a sudden the name clicks and everybody  knows the name.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's interesting to be walking down the street and somebody goes, hey, Louie.  Hey, you know me?  I know you.  You know?  I don't know my name.  As opposed to, hey, you're that guy, right?  How was it working with Pacino?  Yeah, that guy.  Pacino was great to work with, right?  Oh, man.  That was classic working with Al.  You know, he's a pro, great team player. 
[01:56:30]  It was great working with him.  I see.  My thing is, I know I always talk about myself, but acting, I act very mildly.  I did an audition yesterday for a Dane Cook movie, and Dane's a buddy of mine.  And I just, I had to go on tape, you know, because they're casting in Los Angeles.  So I had to go on tape here in New York and put myself on tape with an awful cast.  Casting directors never read with you.  They never give you, like, a real read.  It's always like, you're all failed actors and just awful people.  And my, it was embarrassing.  I should have sent a snuff film.  It would have had a better shot at landing in this comedy.  I was atrocious in that performance. 
[01:57:00]  Well, yesterday you were sitting around, and I thought you were talking to yourself.  I should have been, and I should have just taped it and then mailed that to Dane.  Jimmy was practicing his lines during the show yesterday.  Oh, I was.  During the commercial breaks, yeah.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  It was true.  I bet you weren't practicing today.  You know, you would have got some nice advice here.  Right here, man.  Some tips.  He would have helped you out there, Jimmy.  I'll give you a tip, man.  The best thing is just be yourself.  Don't act like somebody you're not.  See, that's the thing.  I try to be charming sometimes.  He would see me act for five minutes and then call the place he used to do social work at 
[01:57:30]  and go, I got somebody who, you know, he's not going to make it.  I think so.  If you guys have a spot.  And then the hands.  See, what do you do with your hands when you're acting?  When you're just walking around in life, you never think about, where's my hand?  But then the second you get a script and your camera's going, you go, what do I do with my  hands?  In his case, the hands are around people's necks most of the time.  Well, that's true.  Or one is on a gun.  Yeah, you know.  Or a knife.  He always has something going on with his hands in these movies.  Have you ever been in a scene where you're acting with somebody, you're doing a scene 
[01:58:00]  or a play or whatever it is, and you're like, I can't believe I'm working with this person?  I think I do that all the time.  Really?  Yeah.  I pinch myself every day.  I pinch myself the fact that I'm here right now.  You know?  For real.  I mean, like I said, I stumbled onto this, you know?  It wasn't something that I was pursuing.  It was just something that happened.  And like I said, I've been blessed with the fact that I've gotten all these great movies  to work on with all these great actors and stuff.  How about the chicks? 
[01:58:30]  Have there been chicks coming your way since?  Have there been chicks coming my way?  Yeah, since the...  They come my way, man, but for some reason, they just don't see me.  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  You know, I'm not like Mr. GQ.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, come on, dude.  Do you have chicks coming your way?  You raise an interesting point.  I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.  No, no.  It's accurate.  Believe me, that's a good example.  You know what it is, though?  Jimmy's charming.  I'm not charming, though.  He like charms people. 
[01:59:00]  Well, you're despicable lowlife, but you're charming.  But when you look at a guy like Nicholson, that's the beauty of being in the business.  It's like a guy like Nicholson, look at him now.  There's a great picture of him.  You see a picture of him?  You see he's in a boat, and he looks pregnant, and he's eating a sub sandwich, and he has like  a bunch of models, and you're like, that's what the beauty of being an actor is.  No, that's the beauty of having...  That's the beauty of being Jack.  Right.  And having all that cash.  70 with a sub in his fat face and a bunch of tens just sitting around ogling him.  Let me tell you, I just ordered a pizza pie, man.  I don't think I'm going to get much play off of pizza pie. 
[01:59:30]  No, it's not the same thing.  It's not the same thing as Jack.  Yeah, no, Jack's on a yacht.  You know what I'm saying?  How about the new film, War?  War, what are you doing in this with Jet Li, and who we've interviewed also?  Jason Statham, we've interviewed him too.  Who do you play in War?  I play this guy named Benny, who is a double, quadruple undercover agent.  Oh, kind of back and forth.  Kind of like a very layered kind of guy.  Don't know what side you're on?  Oh, I know what side I'm on, but you just don't know what side I'm on. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  You know, I run like a real underground fight club and stuff, but that's just my front.  You know, yeah.  Really suspenseful guy.  They're like holding their breath.  Okay, so.  Well, how does the movie end?  How very, the movie end was like, okay, I got it now.  It's one of those, oh, who saw that coming?  Loose ends up until like the last few minutes.  Yeah, it's like you're trying to figure it out, trying to figure, you know, why is this 
[02:00:30]  guy doing it?  What's his purpose?  And, oh, snap.  It's like your shirt.  I've been sitting here trying to figure it out.  There you go, baby.  And I don't get, it's an I love New York shirt, but instead of the heart being there  with the I love New York, it's you.  It's me, baby.  Louie loves New York.  But isn't that the I?  The I?  Yeah, isn't the I, the letter I would be you.  I, Louie, love. 
[02:01:00]  There's like a lot of love in the Louie, New York.  Yeah.  It should be Louie, heart, and why.  Yeah, but.  That is true.  Yeah, but you see these shirts all the time.  They just like, they take the heart out of the I love New York thing and they put something  else in it.  They put a smiley face.  Or something.  So in this case.  See, that would be I, Louie, New York, which means, you know, you shoot up New York, you  beat up New York, you sell New York some drugs.  That's a good interpretation, actually.  Okay.  You know, one of my favorite Louie Good Bob moments was in Boogie Nights where you just 
[02:01:30]  try to convince them that you're built for pornography.  That's the greatest thing is that it's just like, that's, that's the type of asses that  hang around pornography.  Are these guys that just kind of know the porn people, they try to convince them they belong  in them.  Dude, I met Ron Jeremy.  I said, I can't believe that.  That pot belly guy.  Yeah.  Getting on that plane.  I must be doing something.  Yeah, well, Jimmy met him too.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Oh, no.  He's got to tell you the story now.  He had a threesome with Ron Jeremy.  Yeah, me and Ron, the same girl. 
[02:02:00]  It was, it was, I hosted the Porn Awards in 2004, and at the end of the night, I went  up to my friend's room, and Ron was, let's just say that Ron and I connected.  We kind of just looked at each other.  You couldn't see the girl anymore, but we could look at each other's eyes.  Basically, they could have played cards on her.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah, and there's a definite difference between Ron and me.  Now, let me ask you, which end were you working on?  Let's see.  I could look right down and see her eyes.  Oh, okay.  You know, Ron was handling all the heavy lifting.  Okay, heavy lifting, yeah. 
[02:02:30]  What was I going to do?  You know what I mean?  She just, she just toyed with me.  She's like, oh, yeah, it's good to see you too, still.  But she just did this.  There you go.  You got some play.  Yeah, but that was just because I walked into the right play at the right time.  It had nothing to do with being Jim Norton or being me.  You know, that was just lucky.  My friend hooked me up.  Lucky and go for it.  Yeah, Ron's, Ron shares.  He's like, hey, come on.  You know, and I had a suit on, and I did.  Jimmy's downplaying it.  He's got a beautiful girlfriend.  Oh, really?  Yeah, who's very, very funny and loves him to death.  But before that, Jimmy, you know, he would pay for it.  Yeah.  Really? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, that's money spent.  Yeah, he's got a book that talks all about it.  Did you write it all upon your taxes, bro?  You know what?  I've actually wondered if I could write prostitution, escort service, and stuff like that off, because  I am technically using it in my act.  I was in my comics.  Sure.  So maybe it's some kind of a loophole.  Also in traffic, by the way, which I love.  One of the most disturbing scenes ever.  That's the one with the girl laying back and the drug dealer on top of the bike.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's right at the door, and he's that close to finding his daughter, but he didn't  find her at that point.  They don't come to the door, and the drug dealer, the black drug dealer, is on top of her just 
[02:03:30]  yelling away.  Yeah, that was really sexy.  What was disturbing about that?  It was like, you could see your daughter doing that, but I could also see myself having drugs  and getting your girl to have sex with me.  There was a conflict.  Jimmy had a little conflict.  Yeah, it was really.  Over that scene.  Like, that's got to be awful.  You know, your only daughter is giving herself up like that just to get high.  Yeah, well, unfortunately, that happens nowadays, dude.  Yeah.  I mean, it's bad, I guess, but I guess I've capped it a lot.  It was a good movie, man.  It was a great movie.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a great movie.  You've been in a lot of great films, man. 
[02:04:00]  You're one of those guys, like Frank Vincent, you just pop up in all these classic movies.  He's pretty much been in every film made in the last 12 years.  Yeah.  Somewhere.  Yeah.  You've been in them all.  Oz, too, was very good.  That was a very popular show.  Oh, yeah.  No, I love doing that.  We had a great bunch of guys.  Yeah.  Tom Fontana wrote a great show with his team of writers, and it was great to work on.  The only bad part was I think they knew it was ending, so they tried to wrap a lot of  things up in the last season.  And it was like, wait a minute, this is going by pretty quickly. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you.  Someone's found guilty.  All right.  Execute him.  Let's go.  He's out.  It's like, you know, you don't ever get, you never, I never knew any of the characters  that got paroled.  No.  No.  Think about it.  Everybody's like, you get killed.  That's your way out.  Yeah.  So, you know.  And they would kill, like, main characters all the time, so you probably never knew.  You never knew.  The only thing that I asked when I got killed, please don't let Adebisi kill me.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  As you're saying his name, I was going to ask you, did he die in the series?  I didn't see the end of the series.  Adebisi did, yeah.  He did?  Yeah.  That little sideways hat.  Yeah.  That's cool.  He went on to being lost.  Oh, don't tell me.  What, you're not done with that yet?  No, I didn't really like it.  Oh, son of a bitch.  How do you not like it?  I don't know.  I don't love lost.  Oh, you're silly.  I'm in season two.  It's just getting too weird for me.  I'm going to give it another chance.  Too weird, but that's just it.  I know.  Then you got to.  That's the idea of being lost.  It's weird.  I know, but it's a little bit too much. 
[02:05:30]  It's like, I like being lost with dinosaurs, maybe, but it's just getting too weird.  Something they built, it's just like, well, all right.  All right.  I knew Jimmy would get bored with it.  A lot of people are asking about John from Cincinnati, not to bring up, but HBO canceled  that show.  Yeah, man.  It seems like there's a lot of fans of that show listening right now.  Wow.  They all want us to ask you about that, if you have any inside scoop on that.  Yeah, man.  Well, you know, I was really disappointed to hear it.  You know, I encourage them, keep calling HBO, and it was a great show, man. 
[02:06:00]  You know, one of those shows that you really had to think, you really had to process, you  know, the answers ain't laid out for you.  And it's like, you got to really be checking out to see what's going on.  How many episodes did it last?  We shot 10 episodes of that.  And I was surprised because, you know, HBO, you go for a couple of years at least, you  know?  One would think, but believe me, them calling up doesn't help.  Same thing happened to Jimmy.  I was on a series for one season.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which one was that?  Lucky Louie.  And we lasted for one season. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And, you know, it happens.  Those asses had Arliss on for how many years?  I don't know.  I guess it was popular.  Oh, stop it.  Could be the worst show ever on television.  Oh, was it awful?  Cable or broadcast.  You weren't an Arliss, were you?  He probably was.  He probably had a walk-on part.  He probably had a part in it.  He's in everything.  Maybe I watched it by accident.  Yeah, okay, you just tripped over the remote and it popped on.  Yeah, sure enough.  Well, we've got to plug the movie because their music is playing because we're off the air 
[02:07:00]  by before nine o'clock.  The movie is War.  It starts with Jet Li and Jason Statham.  Jason Statham's great.  And Jet Li is hard to work with because he probably doesn't speak very...  We interviewed him.  He doesn't speak English.  For real?  Yeah.  Oh, man, okay.  Why?  He spoke English?  Huh?  He spoke English when you worked with him?  You know, it was like sign language.  Yeah, broken English.  Yeah.  He gave us a little broken English when he was in here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little bit, but it was kind of hard to...  It was kind of awkward there.  We had a tough time with him.  Really?  He seems like a great guy.  You know, whatever. 
[02:07:30]  His films are good, but...  Kick your colon out.  As far as a radio interview, it was a little tough because you need to speak the language  to communicate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Also in Magnolia, gee, you've done a lot of great...  He's done everything.  And the movie comes out when?  Friday.  Okay, this Friday.  It's War.  I did all my own stunts on it, too.  You'd be proud.  Are there really stunts?  Yeah, man.  Oh, cool.  Why, though?  Why?  Yeah.  You know, I've been working out and stuff, and I figured it was time I could show that  side of my talent, you know?  I detect a little sarcasm. 
[02:08:00]  You know what I mean?  Just a little.  They've already recognized the ability.  Now it's time for the sexuality and the masculinity.  There you go.  That's how you get the leading roles.  You never know what's next, baby.  All right, we got to get out of here.  Thank you, Luis.  Hey, guys, thank you.  Thanks, bro.  For the next two hours.  Right on.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  Have a good day.  We are live on XM Satellite Radio.  Radio, radio, radio. 
[02:08:30]  Hi, exclusively XM people.  And internet, I guess.  Pictures, Eric, of the new studio?  We got Justine Jolie finally calling in.  Finally calling in.  Finally calling in.  I had a little in my mouth when I tried to say her name.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I went.  Justine.  It just kind of.  Mouth fart.  Fuck it, hash.  She was supposed to call about an hour and a half ago.  Of course, the penthouse pet for September.  Justine Jolie, everyone. 
[02:09:00]  What's up, Justine?  Hey.  Dude, I so get into F in life.  Apparently, I so missed the call.  Yeah, we wanted you on about an hour and a half ago.  We played the clip of E-Rock giving you a spanking.  Really?  Or one shot to the bottom.  How's that hiney?  Yeah, we want to find out how the hiney is.  It's kind of bruised.  I mean, it's good, man.  Can you send us a picture or something?  Wait a minute.  Could I?  Yeah, it's the future.  MMS, man. 
[02:09:30]  I don't...  What?  M-what?  MMS.  Picture messaging?  Yeah, it's, you know...  I don't know what that is.  Picture messaging?  Has anybody ever taken a picture message?  No?  What do you sound like?  We're trying to figure it out.  Well, right now, I kind of sound like a raspy whore  because I drank last night  and my throat's a little scratchy.  Well, it was Monday night. 
[02:10:00]  It was Monday night.  Did you get plowed last night?  I know.  Did you have some of that sex last night?  Aw, dude.  Come on.  Did you?  I've hit on, like, three men so far  and, like, several women  and I can't get play from anybody.  I don't want to hear it.  You can wherever you want.  You hit on men and you don't get play.  Where are you?  In Chelsea?  Just bring the magazine with you.  Your guys will fuck you  just because you were in Penthouse.  Yeah, I mean, you got a nice spread  in the Penthouse magazine.  You hear about that?  Positive. 
[02:10:30]  I think what turns off guys  is what you do with your voice.  Okay.  I'm going to be honest with you today  because you have a nice spread in Penthouse  but when you do weird things with your voice  and get Betty Boop-ish and...  I don't know.  It's kind of weird.  Okay, fair enough,  but I'm still not honestly getting any play, man.  I went to hang out with...  And the man thing.  You can't say man.  She's like, man.  See, really?  Yeah, it's cute.  It's like, hey, man.  It reminds me of something  I don't know what.  Hey, man.  Save me a poke.  Dr. Beeper.  Yeah, she sounds like a female Dr. Beeper. 
[02:11:00]  Dr. Beeper and I.  What?  Nothing.  There's a reference from an ancient movie.  Yeah.  Are you sure?  Yeah, we're pretty sure about that one.  I think she's probably...  Came out about 30 years ago,  so that's pretty ancient  as far as our time goes.  Yeah, so to say,  that's not pretty ancient.  When did that come out?  81.  Oh, was it 81?  Or 80.  Yeah, right around there.  No, airplane was 80.  I think it was 79, man.  Caddyshack was 81.  Oh, airplane?  Mine.  That came from airplane?  No, I think... 
[02:11:30]  No, it came from Caddyshack.  I think Animal House is 77.  Caddyshack, maybe?  Caddyshack.  No, airplane was 80.  I think Caddyshack was 81 or 82.  Let's try that.  Iraq, answer.  Answer, Iraq, answer, please.  I'm going with 1980.  80 for Caddyshack?  Yes.  No, I think Caddyshack was after airplane.  Not much, but...  You want me to find out?  Airplane was 80. 
[02:12:00]  Wait, airplane was what?  80.  80, okay.  So then Caddyshack has to be 81, right?  Caddyshack.  None.  Come on.  1980.  80!  Same year?  Yeah, baby.  What a year for comics.  Nice.  And let's not forget Caddyshack 2, 1988.  Oof.  Oof.  Caddyshack, the 19th hole.  Who's in that?  I thought Caddyshack 2, which was fine, but why...  Why are we referencing Caddyshack again?  We always talk about it.  We love it.  Yeah, we love Caddyshack.  See, you're abroad.  You don't understand. 
[02:12:30]  It's a guy thing.  You know what?  I am abroad, and I really don't get the Caddyshack thing.  I'm like, wow, you know what?  Caddyshack is one of the greatest comedies, if not the greatest comedy, of all time.  Yeah.  It's right up there.  It's right up there.  I love when someone mistypes something, and they typed, it was in the year 1908-0.  Wow.  He meant 1980, but it's like...  1908-0.  It's in the future.  Yeah.  Where are you now? 
[02:13:00]  I am laying in my bed.  Why?  No, no, I mean, like, what...  What, uh...  Are you naked?  Yeah, could you be useful for us today?  Huh?  All right.  Could you be useful, Elise?  Maybe, I don't know, use your vibrator or something?  You have a vibe?  You got a vibe, man?  Man.  You guys want to know what's really sad?  What's sad, man?  What is it?  When I was packing, I actually left my Hitachi magic wand at home.  Oh, your what?  Your Hitachi magic wand? 
[02:13:30]  Where's your dildo, Spicoli?  Break it out?  Something must have happened to a man.  None.  She talks like Spicoli.  And she talks over everybody.  Something must have happened to a man.  Come on.  So where'd you leave this Hitachi magic wand?  Oh, she...  She loves to talk.  Well, that's good.  So how's your ass?  My Hitachi magic wand is very disappointed because it hasn't gotten any play in the last six months.  And my ass is pretty... 
[02:14:00]  Why hasn't that had play?  It's not like you have to talk to it or anything.  You just turn it on and use it.  A dildo that doesn't get used gets gummy.  Ew, gross.  It gets gummy.  Yeah, you got to let that vibrator shake all that crap off every once in a while, man.  It starts to look like the end of a faucet that hasn't been used in a while and that stuff  crusses around it.  It gets...  You know what?  The whole thing is that it gets frustrated.  It starts looking like an egg beater that hasn't been in the dishwasher in a while, man.  Ew.  Ew, you guys are mean. 
[02:14:30]  No.  No, man.  We're talking about everybody's vibrator, man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  All right.  So where's the Hitachi magic wand?  Hitachi magic wand is in Los Angeles.  And where are you?  New York.  Why are you still here?  Oh, what?  I'm sorry.  Am I not supposed to be here?  Am I not allowed to be here?  No, no, no, no.  I mean, you were in a hotel, right?  No.  I lived there half the year.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, yeah.  I love living here, actually. 
[02:15:00]  It's one of the coolest cities in the world.  It absolutely is, man.  That's what they say.  You can make it here.  You can make it anywhere.  So how's your ass?  I want to know where that line producer is, actually.  The GOMO gargoyle that decided to fucking hit me.  Ah.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  They haven't talked since the big spank.  I'm sorry.  Where's that fat fuck?  Did he get back on his fucking diet again?  Oh.  Oh, nice.  Justine.  Where's that fat fuck? 
[02:15:30]  Did he get back on his fucking diet again?  Nice.  Uh, E-Rock?  Hello.  How are you?  E-Rock, comment.  No.  I don't really care how she's doing.  Oh.  Justine.  Yeah, well, I don't really care how he's doing either.  Really?  You just asked for me.  Yeah, well, I asked you, fat fuck.  How are you?  You, uh, worked out with that, uh, that girlfriend of yours?  You still think you deserve to have her?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah, she's not envious of you in any way.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:16:00]  I'm not saying she needs to be envious in any way, or even should have been envious.  I'm just saying with your personality, do you think you still deserve her?  Yeah, she didn't think I hit you hard enough.  Really?  Yeah.  Huh.  All right.  Well, then, you know what, I'll make sure that I bring in a cane next time, and we'll  see who's fair.  Cane?  Hold on a minute.  I've been waiting all morning to use this one.  I know timing's everything in, but she'll babble anyway, so it doesn't really matter. 
[02:16:30]  As this queues up, uh, here it is.  Our latest one.  Right center field.  McClouth is back to the track.  He leaps at the wall, and it is gone.  It just cleared.  No.  Oh, they're saying two.  They're saying it's a double.  It went just under the wall.  Oh.  Oh, just under the wall.  That's different.  So, Justine Jolie.  Yeah.  Penthouse pet for September.  Uh-huh.  How's your ass, man? 
[02:17:00]  You know, man, you damaged me.  No, it's fine, actually.  It really is fine.  Your butt cheek healed up.  How's your asshole?  Because I know he palmed it a little.  Yeah.  You know, that's perfect, too.  That's perfect, too.  All right, mom.  So, there's, uh...  It's all little puckered.  It's all cute and pink.  So, there's no bruising, uh, anymore?  Little brown, mom?  Um, no.  Purple, mom?  I, uh, I had that almost on a show, believe it or not.  A roid, mom? 
[02:17:30]  I went to a masseuse afterwards, actually, to make sure that I wouldn't get any bruising.  Oh.  Did you?  Yeah, I did, actually.  Mom?  Hey, uh, why don't you masturbate?  Huh?  How about you do a little of that masturbation for everybody, mom?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Stick that hand down there in bed.  Do I get any play?  Do I get my sexy hot guy to come and help me?  You rock.  Ew, what?  I said a sexy hot guy, sweetheart.  I didn't ask for the Gomer's gargoyle in the corner. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, boy.  She called you a gargoyle again there, you rock.  Oh, yeah.  She got me.  Ooh.  What?  What's your problem with you rock?  I don't really get it.  Um, the fact that he tried to bruise me and he's a misogynistic prick.  Oh.  Oh, you rock.  That's someone that hates women.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For those of you who don't know, yeah, that is somebody who hates women and, or if you  were doing it for the show. 
[02:18:30]  Well, they know now because they had explained that before you explained it, mom.  What?  That's right, mom.  I was like, even if you were doing it for the show, you're still a dick.  Well, I don't know if he was actually doing it for the show.  He just doesn't really understand how you do a spanking.  Yeah.  I don't think he does.  I think he knows how to do a spanking.  If he's been having sex for a while, which that's not a guarantee either.  Oh, wow.  Oh, you rock.  That one's got to hurt.  That one's got to hurt right there.  That was, that was a good one.  From a whore who's, yeah, right. 
[02:19:00]  Okay.  What?  She's not a whore just because she's in penthouse.  What did he say?  Well, he, uh, he might have called.  He just ran out of steam on that when he went, what?  He might have said that I was a whore?  Yeah, he might have called you.  Yeah.  He said from a whore who's, well, you know, okay.  Yeah.  I'm sorry that I'm absolutely comfortable with my sexuality and you still have to live  in the closet.  Ooh.  Oh.  You rock in the closet with a girlfriend.  You're a homo.  You rock is what she's saying.  I'm not saying that he's a homo.  I'm just saying I'm comfortable with my sexuality.  It doesn't mean that I'm a whore. 
[02:19:30]  It means I'm absolutely comfortable with it.  You, on the other hand, apparently can't be, must, you know, feel threatened and have  to call me a whore.  Ooh.  Wow, you rock.  That's a good one.  You got to admit it.  Threatened?  She's good.  She's good, this one.  How am I threatened by you?  I don't know.  Again, going back to the misogyny, it's not.  Well, what do you know?  Let's start with that.  Why would you call me a whore?  What would I have done?  Except for being comfortable with my sexuality.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't mind, you know, showing my nude body because I'm comfortable with it. 
[02:20:00]  I walk around naked.  I sleep in my bed naked.  I'm a nudist.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm just wondering, what makes you so bloody uncomfortable with my sexuality that makes  you think that I'm a whore?  Yeah, you rock.  Yeah, why would your first action after seeing her naked be, you know, hitting her really  hard?  To pretty much punch her in her asshole.  Yeah, why would you do that?  Yeah, you gave her asshole a black eye.  Sorry.  I crack myself up sometimes. 
[02:20:30]  None.  That's right, mom.  None.  I think I should smoke a big fat ass bowl like I did, then you'd still be saying none.  Oh, you did?  You smoked some of that dope this morning?  Smoked some of the guns.  That'll get you far.  All right, what can we stick in you today?  What?  Stick in me?  Okay, now wait.  Yeah.  I have a vibrator doesn't mean to go ahead.  I just like how to play with it.  All right, well, let's play around the rim a little bit.  Put your fingers in your pussy. 
[02:21:00]  Just slowly reach down and...  Yeah, yeah.  Just kind of put your fingers in your...  Yeah.  Yeah, turn everybody around because you still have a few haters out there, believe it or  not.  I don't know why.  I don't know why either.  You're beautiful.  You're in the September issue of Penthouse.  What do you got?  Thank you.  Oh, my goodness.  Deserve a huge kiss.  Too bad I'm not there to give it.  I don't know. 
[02:21:30]  Where should we start?  Should I start by playing with one of my hard nipples?  Because it's lovely.  Should we have Yurok leave the room because he finds this gross...  Fat fuck, leave the room.  Hey, fat fuck, can you leave the room?  She's about to masturbate.  And you're disgusted by it.  And you're disgusting her.  She's implying...  Because you think she has cooties.  You haven't earned the right.  She's implying that you're a pussy dryer.  Yurok hasn't gotten past the point that girls have cooties. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  He was trying to punch her cooties away.  Right.  Because the cooties come out of girls' assholes.  Did you think Yurok was sexy?  Hey, fat fuck, can you leave the studio?  You heard her.  Did you think he was sexy, Justine?  By any chance?  Ooh, can you leave the state?  No.  All right, he refuses to leave, Justine Jolie.  Aww, that's gross.  He's disgusting.  I can't believe after he hit me in the ass, he wants to stay? 
[02:22:30]  Wants to stay for me to masturbate just because he thinks, what?  Excuse me, excuse me, when you refer to what Yurok did to you, could you just say that he  hit you in the asshole?  It just sounds funny.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, what?  What did you say?  I didn't know.  Just refer to what he did to you as hitting you in your asshole.  He punched you in your asshole.  No, there was no punching.  There was no punching.  It was an open hand.  It was like one of those things that if you're a ninja, you do to someone's nose, you take  the heel of your hand and poof, pop it up. 
[02:23:00]  That's what he caught her asshole with, the heel of his hand.  He caught me with a thumb.  No, you didn't actually punch him in the ass.  Wow.  All right, get back to being hot.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Man.  Let's go, man.  Man, man.  So, yeah.  So, I think we were, I think it was at my nipple.  Are you, wait, does he really, does that fat fuck still have to be there, really?  He's gone.  Hey, fat fuck.  Nah, he's still there.  He's being defiant for some reason. 
[02:23:30]  He doesn't like the fact, Yurok doesn't like the fact that she really thinks he's a fat fuck.  Yeah, I think you hurt his feelings by calling him a fat fuck.  Aw, well then get back on the diet.  I don't feel guilty at all.  I actually normally would and be like, aw, I feel really shitty.  Actually, Chris K. from Wilkes-Barre, he's saying, can you refer to the incident as a judo chop to your asshole?  Is that exactly what he referred to it as?  A judo chop. 
[02:24:00]  A judo chop.  I mean, he would like to pretend that he's all, like, massively kung fu.  And Stuart from Charlotte, North Carolina.  Yurok made her brown eye blue.  Made my brown eye angry is what he fucking did.  Oh, yeah.  Do you like to pay him back by spanking him?  She tried.  Well, I like to pay him back by splitting him open with a cane, yeah.  And I mean, actually splitting his skin open with a cane.  I mean, I think that would be fair.  Yurok, would you allow that today?  He doesn't necessarily have to take his clothing off and model for people.  I do. 
[02:24:30]  So, when he did that, he put me back by a week for work.  Look, that's why I'm still in New York.  Yeah, but you could have done, like, some kind of slave thing, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  With that bruise.  No, no.  No?  See, I don't know the business.  All right.  I thought.  Come on.  Fingers in the pussy.  Yeah.  Well, hey, you got to start by rubbing the nipple first.  What do you think?  Eh, nipple schmipple.  I want to hear.  Rubbing the nipples after five, ten seconds is overrated.  Let's go.  That's enough. 
[02:25:00]  Let's go, toots.  Hey, I like my nipples.  They get me.  That's good.  I mean, you know, if a guy is there with you, he'd pay attention to the nipples.  But on the phone, it's like, are you playing with your nipples?  Eh.  Not so much.  Not so much.  Not so much.  I've been playing with my nipples the whole time.  I don't even know why.  So, just throw two, three, five fingers in there.  Yeah.  I can get three in.  You get three in?  Thank you. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  Shove them in there.  Oh, hey.  Spit on your fingers and shove them in.  Right.  Like you're looking for something under your counter.  Yeah.  Like I'm, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Like you're trying to reach something.  Like you're trying to reach something that's just out of reach with your three fingers.  Like you're trying to reach something under the dresser.  It's like, oh, God, my fingers are almost there.  Yeah.  That's what you got to do.  Yeah.  Shove them in there.  Oh.  Getting really close to maybe slipping one in. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, no fingers in yet?  Oh, I lied.  One.  One's in?  Mm-hmm.  Rule out the next one.  Mm-hmm.  Put the phone down there.  We want to hear squishy noises.  Oh.  I can't put, oh.  Ew.  Squishy.  Squishy.  Just do it, man.  Come on, man.  I want to hear squishy noises, man. 
[02:26:30]  No, I'm not going to end up making squishy noises.  Come on, mom.  Yeah.  Let's do that.  All right.  Hang on.  Is that squishy enough for you?  I heard a little squishy.  Yeah, spit on your hand.  You need a little more lube, it looks like.  No, it just doesn't make squishy noises.  It's a little too tight for them.  E-Rock, by the way, is listening in on this. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, well.  He's jerking off.  I feel really, really bad for his girlfriend.  Why?  Why do you feel bad for his girlfriend?  She's beautiful.  Well, no, I mean, obviously.  She's a looker.  But I'm just saying, I feel bad for her because she has to put up with such a prick for a boyfriend.  Wow.  You're not getting over this.  I thought by now we'd be past this whole punch to the asshole.  But it wasn't a punch, though.  I don't know if I ever like E-Rock.  Take a little judo chop to the ass. 
[02:27:30]  A little judo chop, yeah.  Yeah.  Right to the asshole.  You don't want to be fucking judo chop to the ass.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  E-Rock is, what's wrong?  Why are you rolling your eyes?  We've got a beautiful girl on the phone.  I don't know if I can't get off.  She's making squishy noises, Mon.  And you're rolling your eyes over there.  Microphone.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Here comes E-Rock again.  Yes, but I can hear him.  Could you just do what they asked you?  This is taking forever. 
[02:28:00]  I am doing what they're asking me to do.  Well, we're...  Got a couple of fingers up there.  I'm sorry that some of you can't.  I'm like, I'm sorry that you can't, E-Rock.  Put a thumb up your ass.  Yeah, let's go with the...  Ow.  No.  Just put a thumb up your ass.  No, that's...  Could you put a thumb up your ass?  Yeah, who's looking?  Just do the thumb up the ass.  No one's looking.  Spit on your thumb.  How about E-Rock do it first?  And then...  All right.  Are you into weird stuff?  Like, what kind of weird stuff?  Can you, like, shit in a bag and throw it up against a wall? 
[02:28:30]  Oh, my God.  I just want to meet the person who can't.  No, I'm serious.  Can...  Are you ready for your morning dump?  Uh, no.  How funny would that be if we could listen to that?  Ah, that'd be good.  Okay, wait a minute.  Jimmy's in.  Why would you want to listen to me taking my morning dump?  Because this is what we do.  It's great radio.  This is different.  Like, all the radio shows, they get the hot chick on the phone and she does something sexy  and everyone laughs and laughs and jerks off and we move on.  But let's go a little different today.  How about hot chick taking her morning dump? 
[02:29:00]  Possibly, preferably, in a little baggie and then you throw it up against a window.  But if you don't want to do that, we'll just listen to you, like, sitting there, releasing.  E-Rock, do we have the audio of the girl doing exactly what we just mentioned?  If you can find that.  I would be more than happy to take a seeming pile if I can throw it on E-Rock.  E-Rock, would you allow shit on your face?  E-Rock, comment.  Surprisingly, he said no.  Really?  Oh, I thought he was totally into scat porn. 
[02:29:30]  No, he's not.  Do you take big dumps or little dumps?  Yeah, what kind of, like, does it taper off nice or is it kind of like stewy?  Big soft serve ice cream or milk duds?  Huh?  I was going to say, it depends on if it's a python night or a pebble night.  Well, what did you drink last night?  I had a bottle of Sardin√©.  All right, a bottle of wine.  Any drugs?  A bowl.  In a bowl. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, all right, you smoked pot, I'm sorry, and you had a bottle of wine.  What did you eat?  What kind of munchies did you have?  What did you have for dinner?  If you need to know, I had a little pasta with a little asparagus and chicken.  Oh, that's great.  All in the pasta, and I had a little side of red sauce, and I had some of those spicy  mussels in a red sauce, and a little salad.  You know, all that sounds fabulous, minus the meat.  Whatever.  This is fascinating.  What were your munchies last night? 
[02:30:30]  I had sweet potatoes.  I had, oh, Flight of the Condors is what I was watching last night.  I had spinach, green beans, mac and cheese, which I made from scratch.  Jimmy's a pro when it comes to this.  What do you think, Jim?  It's probably going to be pretty solid, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  But loosey-goosey, because of the spinach.  It's going to slide out nice.  No, the spinach won't come out yet.  Mac and cheese, we can only hope she's lactose intolerant.  No, because then it'll be a big soupy mess. 
[02:31:00]  And then I also had a very rare brie with olives and crackers.  Oh, that could be a mess.  That could be a pile of venison meat.  That could be a pile of grossness, except for, as soon as, by the way, whatever comes in,  whatever goes in your mouth should immediately leave.  Oh?  Yeah, it shouldn't just stay in your body, because it's kind of toxic if it does.  Oh, so you're bulimic?  No, I kind of already did, I already took my dump last night after I ate, dude. 
[02:31:30]  Can't go through you that fast.  Yeah, what are you, a goose?  Huh?  It doesn't go through you that fast, like 18 hours, I think.  I thought you meant when you sucked a dick, the guy had to leave right away.  Well, that too.  All right, Justine Jolie, you're boring, everybody.  So you want to take a dump in a baggie and throw it up against the window,  or do you want to masturbate?  What do you want to do?  I'll masturbate.  I'd rather take a dump in a fucking huge plastic baggie and then throw it on E-Rock. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, E-Rock, that would be cool.  We all would.  What if the baggie's sealed?  What if she comes in sometime this morning with her shit in a baggie?  And you'd just feel the sheer weight of her shit hitting you.  Hitting you, E-Rock.  What do you think?  No shit gets on you, but it would be like that thud of the shit hitting you.  Should I put it in a freezer, or should I put it in a microwave so it's hot?  No, no.  Would you give Eric a hot plate?  Listen, if we put a plastic baggie over it, if we put like saran wrap on his face, the 
[02:32:30]  old dignity saver, if you want to pay him back, would you give him a hot plate?  I certainly would.  That's where you fucking drop a giant pile of soupy shite all over his fucking muckneck  face and straighten him right out.  I would eat nothing.  Now, E-Rock, if it's all plastic bag, it wouldn't even touch you.  24 hours just for that.  No?  All right, listen, Jolie, we got the clip.  Listen closely.  I know that's tough for you, but listen closely.  This is a lady.  I think she's a truck driver where she hangs with a truck driver. 
[02:33:00]  She took a crap in a plastic bag, and then she throws it up against a window.  This is the real deal.  Here it is.  Okay, I'm tying the bag up.  Did you hear it?  Do it again.  Do it again.  Okay.  Come on, Lauren.  She's throwing her shit bag against the window.  Look, we all got a good laugh now.  Is that real or not?  It's not real.  All right, one more time. 
[02:33:30]  Throw it against the window?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's really starting to stink up the truck.  Okay, here we go.  You actually took a dump in a plastic bag?  Justine, who are you talking to?  I thought she was live.  Apparently not.  No, but did she really take a dump in a bag and kept throwing it against it? 
[02:34:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, my...  Yeah.  That's about the only way that call could have ended.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, she's okay.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She's been in 100 pornos?  Really?  According to IMDb?  Softcore?  I don't know.  We can look up her IMDb.  Or, you know, big one in the asshole. 
[02:34:30]  Hey, we...  Some of that asparagus coming up from last night.  Wow.  There you go.  Hey, we got Wired Magazine.  Some dude over there, Steve Knopper?  Knopper?  Steve Knopper?  Douche Satchel.  Is the K silent?  It must be.  So it's Steve Knopper.  And the guy doesn't like us, and he can write whatever the fuck he wants.  We're trying to get him on the phone, but, of course, he's avoiding us.  Hold on a minute.  Hello?  Yeah? 
[02:35:00]  Who's this?  Justine.  Who's this?  Justine who?  Tully.  Oh, what's up?  How you doing?  We're doing very well.  We wanted you to call in today because we want to know how your asshole's doing.  Are we going through this all over again?  They're going through what?  We were talking a little while earlier. 
[02:35:30]  About what?  And I kept coming into E-Rock.  About what?  Well, I have to know if that lady was real about pooping in the bag and then throwing it up against the window.  What lady?  I know back in the day we had a lady who'd, like, crap into a plastic bag and throw it up against a window.  Yeah, that's what I do.  In a truck.  Yeah.  Why are you bringing that?  Did you do that, though?  Why are you bringing that up today?  Did you?  The one to...  Hello?  Yeah.  Justine Jolie, what's up? 
[02:36:00]  What's up?  We want to know how your asshole is today after E-Rock kind of slapped it really hard.  Massively slapped it and tried to hurt me.  It's fine.  Oh, it's fine?  Yeah.  Maybe.  Is it all bruised and stuff, or...?  All right, Wired Magazine.  So this guy, Steve Knopper, just taking cheap shots at us, whatever, but the guy won't come on our show to discuss this.  Of course.  There's a new rating system for radio. 
[02:36:30]  We can't really get into it too much, but we can read this article.  Arbitron's portable...  ...writes this article, and it starts off by saying,  You ever wonder why those twits, Opie and Anthony, get to be radio stars?  Twits?  So call our show...  Ever wonder why cuntbag Steve Knopper gets to write for a magazine?  He's in Denver. 
[02:37:00]  Go ahead, Jimmy.  How do you spell his last name?  Knopper, K-N-O-P-P-E-R.  I believe you could go on Wired Magazine or Wired.com, and you could comment about this article.  Is that true there, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Okay, so you could go to Wired.com and comment about this particular article.  You know why twits like us become radio stars, you idiot?  Because we go on the radio and give people a show that apparently they enjoy and want to listen to.  Right.  Steve Knopper.  Why would people read your articles? 
[02:37:30]  Because you write about us and we talk about it.  Believe me, no one was fucking reading this.  And you know what?  I know it's easy to just beat the crap out of them on Wired.com,  but some other people ask him, why won't you go on Opie and Anthony's show and discuss why you called them twits?  They would really like to know.  Yeah, go ahead.  Instead of hiding behind your stupid keyboard.  He covers the music business for Rolling Stones.  Of course he does.  Ah, that's difficult.  Of course he does.  Now it makes sense.  Yeah, he's a fuck.  He's one of those too hip for the room.  Yep. 
[02:38:00]  Wannabe little cunts.  Right.  He looks like a little mama's boy.  Wanted to be a rock star.  Or a radio guy.  He wanted to be something.  He wanted to be something, but what he is, look at the fucking Elliot Gould smile on his stupid face.  I have no respect for journalists that won't come on our show after they write something, you know, about us.  You know, if you're brave enough to do it with a typewriter, with your laptop,  you should be brave enough to call our radio show.  I like to give him the speech Elliot Gould got in American History X. 
[02:38:30]  Steve Knopper.  Yeah.  Oh, what a jerk off he looks like.  Hold on a second.  Uh, who's this?  Justine.  Justine who?  Jolie.  Hey, Justine, Jolie.  What's going on?  You were supposed to call like, uh, two hours ago.  Yeah, well, I called in now.  Actually, over two hours.  Wait a minute.  I've been on the phone with you for like 40 minutes.  Uh, no, you haven't.  Yeah, I have.  No, this is the first time we're talking to you. 
[02:39:00]  How are you?  Did you, uh, did the other show?  Come on, guys.  I called in at 902.  There's two shows going on here.  The XM one and the one for the FM station.  You sure you didn't call them?  Because they fuck around like that sometimes and take our calls.  So you might have been talking.  You might have been talking to them.  They might have been screwing with you.  Except for I just totally railed E-Rock.  E-Rock's not even in today.  No.  Dude, don't even play.  E-Rock was in.  I know.  No shit.  No, no. 
[02:39:30]  What?  I heard his voice.  I heard his voice and I was railing him.  Telling him he should go back on his diet.  I really don't know what that's all about.  But Justine, we wanted you to call in today because E-Rock last week did, uh, what?  Slap you in the asshole.  Yeah.  Well, slap my ass.  Almost.  Yeah.  It made me a bruise where I couldn't work.  Right.  So we want an update.  How's your ass doing after E-Rock slapped you so hard last week?  Fine.  Absolutely fine.  I went to a masseuse and made sure that they, you know, rubbed the arnica in pretty deep.  Oh. 
[02:40:00]  Wait, why would you go to a masseuse?  Uh, because you're...  So, um, Steve Knopper.  What is that?  Huh?  It's, um, good call.  I think Ope said it.  Well, the wannabe jerk off with the fucking lipless smile.  Um, is, uh, uh, a wannabe rocker.  Oh.  And there's pictures of him in a band.  Go, uh, go up a little higher, please.  The name of it is called...  How high, buddy?  Uh, it's called the, an evening of Blurt in Chicago. 
[02:40:30]  And it was, uh, the empty bottle and, uh...  Back in 2000?  Yeah.  He's raising money for Cabrini Green tutoring program.  Uh, the Lester Bangs Memorial Tribute Band.  And I'd love to get audio on these fucking dickbags.  Um, he plays, like, he plays the, uh, like, the synthesizer or piano.  Oh, of course he does.  He's just a nerd.  Huh.  Well...  Ew.  What an asshole. 
[02:41:00]  Wannabe failure?  Yeah, he wanted to be a rock guy.  You're a fucking failure, dickbag.  Just a jerk off the rights.  I can't stand anybody that's been a success in whatever they do, because you're a fucking  failure.  You, you write for, uh, uh, a bunch of, uh, magazines.  Great.  You write little blurbs in a bunch of magazines.  Can't hold down one fucking magazine.  No magazine said, wow, you're good, we want you.  Oh, my God.  And he's married, no offense.  He's married to fucking...  He's married to E-Rock. 
[02:41:30]  With a wig.  With a fucking mullet wig.  Wow.  He looks like Eric with a mullet wig.  E-Rock with a, uh, spinal tap wig.  No offense, Eric.  None taken.  Too bad E-Rock's not here today.  Uh, hello, who's this?  It's Justine.  I keep getting cut off.  Justine who?  Oh, come on.  Justine Jolie.  Hey, Justine.  I know I'm on your shit list.  I'm sorry.  What are you talking about?  No.  We feel bad with, uh, what happened last week with E-Rock, uh, what? 
[02:42:00]  He slapped your asshole really hard.  But, and you were supposed to call about two and a half hours ago now.  Well, dude, I called ages ago.  I called at nine.  You couldn't have called at nine because that's in between, uh, radio shows.  I know.  You guys were on break.  We have, like, a 10 or 15 minute break.  I know.  And I waited on the phone for 10 minutes until you came back.  So, Justine, E-Rock, what?  Yeah, Meg.  Uh, like, slapped you really hard in your asshole, uh, last week.  And we just want to know how your ass is doing today.  So, can we read this article from, uh, Steve Knopper? 
[02:42:30]  He, uh, he writes,  Ever wonder why those twits Opie and Anthony get to be radio stars?  Blame Arbitron.  And perhaps yourself, he writes.  I guess he wasn't down in Washington to, to see how big this show has gotten.  Uh, since the 1960s, the survey research company has paid listeners to keep a handwritten log  of every station they tune into.  Arbitron crunches the numbers, releases the ratings, and presto.  And presto.  Uh, doofus shock jocks stay on the air. 
[02:43:00]  So, he has a problem with shock jocks in general.  Doofus.  But we're more than shock jocks.  Doofus.  Dick.  It's so typical of a fucking guy that writes for Rolling Stone or one of those magazines  to be, like, one of these just elitist little cunts who's writing about a show that he's  in Denver.  He probably doesn't, he's never heard, or he's heard very briefly.  We're not on in Denver, and I doubt he has...  He's heard news about us.  Yeah, he's just, he's one of these little, like, uh, these little snotty, uh, wants to 
[02:43:30]  be seen as this, like, really hip genius type of guy, uh, jerk off.  There you go.  And he writes, uh, now with the introduction of its portable people meter, the company  is on the verge of a radical, uh, leap into the present.  The BlackBerry-sized gadget clips the listener's clothing, eliminating the log.  Participating broadcasts are encoded with, uh, inaudible ID code, which is picked up by  a sensor in the device.  Whether you're bopping to Kylie Minogue in your car, or swaying to air supply in the produce  aisle, he just used the worst two examples ever.
