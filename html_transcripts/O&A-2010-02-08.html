<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts self-deprecatingly labeling themselves "the dumbest guys in radio," before launching into a critique of the Super Bowl pre-game show, decrying its excessive length and pomp.  They followed with a scathing review of the Super Bowl commercials, particularly targeting those perceived as relying on racial stereotypes, citing examples featuring Betty White, Abe Vigoda, and a Bud Light ad.  The Who's halftime performance received similar treatment, with commentary focused on the age and performance of Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, and Queen Latifah's rendition of "America the Beautiful" being described as overly theatrical.  A lengthy segment dissected Jay-Z's remix of "Forever Young," with Opie expressing intense dislike for the remix, leading to a discussion with multiple listener calls debating its merits.  Steve Winwood's performance of "Higher Love" was also deemed "horrendous."  Other topics included a listener email about Tim Tebow,  listeners' opinions on the Super Bowl and the performances, an anti-abortion commercial described as boring, and a brief discussion of Obama's political stance on partisan gridlock. The segment concluded with further discussion of the Super Bowl commercials and a humorous anecdote about a listener's snowy experience.  Numerous instances of profanity and offensive language were present.

The show continued with a discussion of Herschel Walker's boxing match, followed by a further critique of The Who's halftime performance, and a transition into a heated debate about race relations in America.  Patrice O'Neal was in studio, and a caller, Trish from Kentucky, angrily confronted Patrice about his frequent focus on race, leading to a heated exchange involving racial slurs and insults between the hosts, Patrice, and Trish.  The hosts' differing perspectives on racial issues were highlighted, with Opie described as inconsistent and Patrice as consistently critical of perceived unfair treatment of Black artists.  Further calls, including one from a truck driver who supported the show's frank discussions on race, and a self-identified racist from Michigan, fueled the discussion, which delved into topics such as racial prejudice, stereotypes, and the disproportionate representation of Black people in the prison system.  The segment also touched upon the Tim Tebow pro-life commercial and speculation about the Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Oprah Winfrey Super Bowl surprise commercial.

A significant portion of the show focused on the controversial Tim Tebow anti-abortion commercial, prompting extremely vulgar and offensive commentary from the hosts and Patrice O'Neal regarding Tebow's appearance and sexuality, as well as details about his mother's high-risk pregnancy.  The show then contrasted this with a rejected gay dating website commercial, leading to further offensive commentary about homosexuality.  A substantial portion of the broadcast featured clips from an interview with the incarcerated Plaxico Burress, with humorous, yet offensive, discussions of his prison experiences.  This transitioned into a discussion of athletes, guns, and race, heavily laden with offensive language.  Mad Dog Russo joined via phone for a lengthy discussion about the Super Bowl, quarterbacks (Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, Dan Marino, and Tom Brady), and concluded with commentary on Super Bowl commercials and a humorous critique of a weatherman's report. Jason Ellis was mentioned as a guest outside the studio and Chris “Mad Dog” Russo was a guest on the phone.

The show continued with a discussion on ranking the greatest quarterbacks, focusing on Mad Dog Russo's criteria. This quickly shifted to a highly offensive and vulgar discussion about the attractiveness of Aboriginal women, featuring racist and sexist language from the hosts and guest, Jason Ellis (who was physically present), who shared a personal anecdote about dating an Aboriginal woman.  The conversation bounced between Ellis's satellite radio vs. terrestrial radio experiences,  a comparison of different types of attractive women, a discussion of mustaches, and a detailed discussion of various MMA fighters (Herschel Walker, King Mo, Fedor Emelianenko, Nick Diaz, Brett Rogers, Randy Couture, Mark Coleman, and Tito Ortiz), touching on their skill, personalities, and perceived racial biases.  The segment concluded with Ellis's recollections of his professional skateboarding career and his opinions on Tony Hawk, including the showing and discussion of a video of Tony Hawk's first 900, and a clip from a previous Ellis appearance on the show.

The final segment focused on skateboarding, contrasting older "ramp" skaters like Tony Hawk with newer street skaters.  The conversation transitioned to the Mega Ramp competition and a graphic recounting of Jake Brown's near-fatal fall, witnessed by Jason Ellis.  Ellis described his own skateboarding injuries, leading into a detailed description of his upcoming "Ellis Mania 5" event in Las Vegas, featuring bizarre and dangerous fight events (blindfolded boxing, fights with electric dog collars, "Don Fry" style fights, and a planned wheelchair fight with Mark Zupan).  Videos of previous Ellis Mania events, including Jake Brown's fall and a Don Fry fight, were referenced.  The segment concluded with plugs for Ellis's upcoming appearances and Ellis Mania 5.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I believe we put on a fine show every day, but let's not be mistaken, we are the dumbest  guys in radio.  Ew, it's Opie and Anthony, this place sucks. 
[00:00:30]  There's no mistake about it, we are the dumbest guys in broadcasting.  Anybody that doesn't appreciate this radio show can go and kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  What will happen today?  I can't believe anyone is still listening to this show.  Well, you want me to fuck your dick?  Do that.  Why don't you tell me my balls smell like a ham and monster on wheat?  I'm going to smoke your crumbs so good.  This is going to be another stupid show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Wow.  How many people are still unconscious?  Semi-conscious?  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe we should talk about the Super Bowl in an hour when everybody starts waking up.  We should have started this show an hour late.  Yeah, Super Bowl Sunday is one of those things where then Monday, it should be a holiday. 
[00:01:30]  I agree.  Why not?  We should have off.  That way you could have a giant, you know, ridiculous party and not have to worry.  Or move the Super Bowl to Saturday.  Yeah.  Just having it on a Sunday and having a late start is stupid.  I know.  By the time the game's over, then you drive back to your house or whatever.  Yeah, then a lot of people have to drive.  No one's up right now.  Look.  Nah.  Usually the phones are waiting for us. 
[00:02:00]  Nah, everybody's snoozing.  Snoozing away.  A lot of people probably take them like a sick day today, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't doubt that, too.  Well, the Saints beat the Colts.  What?  31-17?  Oh, the game.  Right.  As far as football games go, it was a great game.  But it was the Super Bowl.  The game is, like, secondary.  Yeah.  I feel so, in a weird way, I feel bad for the players that they have to play under those  conditions. 
[00:02:30]  They come out on the field and then they stand around for 45 minutes.  Oh, my God.  As there's a huge stage.  The pomp and circumstance.  Stage and fireworks and smoke and this and that and that.  And then they finally start playing football.  It's like, can we play the game?  Is it time yet?  Can we play the game like we've been playing it all year long?  What is this strange way we're playing the game?  That's why I, you know, knew what time the game started.  But I'm partying, playing some poker and stuff.  We're doing all kinds of stuff at my house. 
[00:03:00]  And I kept hearing, you know, well, when the game starts, when the game starts.  And I'm looking at my watch going, didn't start yet?  I know.  Like they say, the official start was, what, six?  Six, I think.  Ah, whatever, yeah.  And then they didn't really start until, like, almost seven.  Yes, 6.30, 6.40.  With all the crap that goes on.  All the filler bullshit.  I think we said it last year.  And I think we're going to be one of the only shows today that will not really be acknowledging 
[00:03:30]  these Super Bowl commercials.  We said it last year that it was over.  That there's enough about, you know, highlighting and talking about Super Bowl commercials.  And this time, they all fell flat, except for the Jay Leno, David Letterman, Oprah thing,  which we'll get into a little later, maybe.  Is it, are the commercials, though, on the list that maybe a talent coach would put out?  Is that, because I'm sure Super Bowl commercials is probably on that list. 
[00:04:00]  I mean, it started off, it started off with potential with the Betty White commercial and  the Abe Vigoda.  Yeah.  Good to see that Abe Vigoda is still alive.  Yeah.  Getting tackled.  So it had potential, but then, I don't know, what are we going to do?  Talk about the fucking beaver playing the violin and the Simpsons ad that fell horribly  short and flat.  It's one of those situations where it's nostalgia now.  Like Super Bowl commercials were a huge thing years back, and then now they're just, it's 
[00:04:30]  nothing.  You see, and I think the internet has a lot to do with it, because you just see so much  outrageous shit that people throw together themselves online that doesn't, it doesn't  have to be here to political correctness or, you know, product placement.  You just see outrageous shit all the time.  So now you watch and just go, who cares?  I think that's why we fight against political correctness and some others, some others are  fighting the good fight alongside us. 
[00:05:00]  And that's the reason why, because in the end, this is what you get.  You get commercials where white guys look like idiots.  Dumb white guys.  Dumb, silly, stupid white guys that don't know how to wear pants.  Amazing, genius black people.  Stable families in normally broken homes of certain ethnic communities.  But on the commercials, it's just magic.  It's magical.  And bad white people. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, horrible, horrible white people.  Not even horrible white people.  Just stupid, silly, you know, the women run their lives type of guys.  There was one really funny Bud Light commercial.  It had the white guys with their black friends and their Asian friends to show that everyone  enjoys it.  Yeah, I know.  I love that too.  Get it.  What about Chevy Chase?  What about that?  Doing the vacation.  What about the vacation thing? 
[00:06:00]  Why is the Griswold's grandfather going on vacation?  Well, Spectro is starting in from Michigan.  He writes, number one, Tim Tebow's favorite website is Meatspin.  I tweeted.  As soon as that Tim Tebow fucking ad ran, I tweeted immediately.  I'm like, am I the only one that thinks this guy's a little light in the loafers?  A little gee.  And what? 
[00:06:30]  It was an abortion commercial, I guess?  Anti-abortion commercial?  Very controversial.  Remember, the whole world was supposed to stop spinning because of this commercial?  Exactly.  And then it was the most boring commercial that they had all night long.  And I don't even really know what it was for.  Yeah, it was, you know, family values.  Something.  Anti-abortion.  I should have just kicked a pregnant woman down the stairs and said, don't do this.  It would have been a little more entertaining.  And then he also writes, Pete Townsend should be in next year's homeless shopping spree. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, the Who.  The Who's halftime show.  Well, fuck.  I'll tell you one thing about the Who, though.  I mean, hey, they were all right.  They were all right.  I mean, you've got to remember, Roger Daltrey's 66.  Pete Townsend's 65.  Isn't that odd that Daltrey's older than Townsend?  Why?  I don't know.  Townsend just looks really old.  Townsend looks old?  Yeah, Townsend looks really old. 
[00:07:30]  But Townsend looks like an old guy that can still get around.  Daltrey looked like a guy that's trying to keep it all together that can't really.  Just kind of holding it together when he's just coming apart at the seams.  He wasn't moving around that much.  And that would have been an exciting set if it was 1979, 1989.  He would have been freaking out.  Maybe even 1999.  Oh, God.  But at this point, I was a huge Who fan growing up.  I don't know.  I don't know what to say about that. 
[00:08:00]  But I'll tell you this.  This is what I was going to say.  That stage they had, you're going to see every super group using that technology.  I don't think anyone has used that technology before.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  That was pretty amazing, wasn't it?  I'll give them that.  You want to see a nice video clip?  I'm sure the NFL has ripped them all down.  Of course they have.  Do not use.  Why?  Copyright infringement.  Why?  All this stuff is not valuable the day after.  Eh, well, they'll put out a video or some crap. 
[00:08:30]  Of what?  All the festivities?  Who loves their lasers?  That's what it is.  Always has.  Who loves their lasers?  Who was the creep on drums?  Wasn't that Sharky?  Wasn't that Ringo's son?  That's Ringo's son, right?  Yeah.  Someone tweeted me saying it looked like Dana Carvey.  It looked like, what's his name from Spinal Tap?  Yeah, that's, we're looking.  How many times have they played this song? 
[00:09:00]  He sounded terrible, Dalton.  Papers gave him a good write-up, but I didn't think he sounded that bad.  Oh.  You want to hear someone that sounds horrible.  I must have played them all, but I ain't seen nothing like him.  In the amusement hall, that death of a blind kid.  That's really, that's pretty much how Daltrey sounds.  But this is down, this is pitched down.  Pitched down a little bit.  I don't know if they could hear each other. 
[00:09:30]  That is some fucking stage, though.  What do you think he does?  I don't know what makes him so good.  Oh my God.  Jesus Christ.  That stage is fucking cool as shit, though.  It was a montage.  Man, kid.  Of their hits. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Look at that stage, though.  Just fucking boom.  Now listen, we all know how this vocal's gone.  And he's probably going to just pitch it down.  Are you watching this for the first time?  Yeah.  That ain't bad.  It's, it's...  Yeah, he couldn't, he couldn't get up there.  I'll get my back into my living.  It's all right.  He's giving it his darndest. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  A lot of energy.  Oh, this is a big one.  To prove I'm right.  All right.  I don't need to be forgiven.  Yeah, he kicked.  It's nice that he's 66, but...  Yeah.  It's not a pleasant vocal to listen to.  He's not telling you with the ease in which he used to.  You know what?  He'll say that, but... 
[00:11:00]  I would say he pulled it off.  Yeah, absolutely.  He pulled it off.  I think there's better bands and acts to get for the halftime show.  And it kills me to say that, because I am a big Who fan from way, way back.  But I think their time has really passed them by for the most part,  as far as these big, over-the-top appearances, you know?  And that does look like Dana Carvey on drums.  Oh, yeah.  I know who did not pull it off.  Did you watch the four-hour pregame show?  No, I was busy for the four-hour pregame show. 
[00:11:30]  But are you going to talk about Queen Latifah?  No, she...  Honestly, you know what?  I just knew the national anthem lasted 25 minutes.  I felt bad for the players.  They were just wanting to play.  And there's Queen Latifah doing...  Just this over-the-top...  Her Inigata DeVita version of fucking...  Yeah.  Enough.  With the fucking trying to pull a Whitney Houston...  They're all trying to do that money, right?  Ever since Whitney did it and it was released and it was during, you know, the first Gulf War 
[00:12:00]  and it was big and patriotic and being played on the radio,  ever since then, everyone feels they've got to put their own spin on the national anthem and just...  Ladies and gentlemen...  Well, I said she did America the Beautiful Country.  Oh, great.  Carrie Underwood did the national anthem.  She did all right.  Queen Latifah.  She's sassy.  It's a Broadway show.  Let's get a second.  It's a Broadway show all of a sudden.  They want to play football, but we have to do some Broadway numbers. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, beautiful for space.  It's a Broadway show. 
[00:13:00]  There's a kid's dance like all kinds of shit going on.  The player's just like, is it kickoff time? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, and the girl's signing.  Look at all the races are together.  Oh, that's great.  What point is it?  I don't remember this part.  She's making her own.  You know, make America the Beautiful, you're wrong.  The gospel shit. 
[00:14:00]  Ah, we're fucked.  We're fucked.  I didn't want the gospel story.  Let's throw the gospel shit.  It's gospel.  It's a Benetton ad.

[00:27:00]  now Steve Winwood  did not pull it off  whatsoever  what did he do  he did  higher  or what  high  he  higher love  is a terrible song  well you gotta hear  how he does it now  that's a very  difficult song  you found it  I think so  pretty high  oh here it is  listen to Steve Winwood  not pulling it off  alright  you're gonna think  Roger Daltrey  listen to it  there must be 
[00:27:30]  high love  without a love  don't you  get the start to go  without a love  love is wasting time  look inside  don't go now  look inside  things look so bad  everywhere  very staccato  no one is enjoying this  you know  it's got range 
[00:28:00]  Steve Winwood is a poor  I won't have to argue that  what a fucking  poor this guy is  but he's singing it 
[00:28:30]  very much  staccato  to save his  his  fucking  horrendous  cause he knows  he can't do it  the original way  anymore  if you stretch those  those notes out  you're fucked  but he's hitting them  nobody's  for a split second  he's hitting them  outside the stadium  he can't do it  he can't do it  and I'll  love  ah whatever  don't have spent 
[00:29:00]  all day on it  but  what else is he saying  he was touring with  Clapton  which just sounds like  the worst show ever  Winwood has sung a lot  of shit over the years  he's alright  he's a great guitarist  but he's fucking  boring too  his new phone ad  where it's got the  little fender  stratocaster  designer phone  Clapton's more than  alright Jimmy  Clapton is  does he  he bores me to tears  Layla  you got my  on my knees  Layla  you got my  on my knees 
[00:29:30]  wait  why don't you play  a little Layla  so we can do this  right  it's a nice long intro  so you can get  all your rap shit in  before you know  the great Clapton  starts  yeah that is a good  song  I'm so done  with the rap guy  fucking doing the  sample thing  fucking with it  listen to Steve  Winwood  this is what happens  they're done  they're over  but this Forever Young  really just bothered me  and it finally put me  over the top  I don't even know why  probably because it's  that new fucking wave  shit that we sort of  grew up with  but no one would even  be thinking about that 
[00:30:00]  song right now  if it wasn't for  J.C. Sampling  no we got a fucking  80s channel on Sirius XM  that song pops up on there  in my car  my car  my car  I think they did that one  did they  I think someone did  fucking simple  someone fucked with  that one  you got Layla  well I'm trying my  hardest to find a  non-live version  but I swear to god  every Layla version  is either X'd out  which means that I  can't play it  or it's live  why can't you play it  what does X'd out mean 
[00:30:30]  the file has been  X'd out  oh well  and I'm very self  conscious about  playing live  oh I wonder why  it's not like we've  given you tons of  shit about that  Anthony I hate to  tell you this but  Matt and White Plains  go ahead Matt  and Sam should have  alerted us to  this one  I'm surprised Sam  didn't get this one  Cameron  just want to have fun  in a rap  rap song  Cameron  are you kidding me  we're like joking  trying to pick some  some fucking  who 
[00:31:00]  killer cam  killer cam  do we have that  I want to hear  if it's like  the same fucking  shit  talking over the  song  about bitches  cars  weed  shooting  killer  killer  dipshit  charlamagne  oh yeah  Joe's got to tell you  who it is  what they want  say  oh yeah  I meant it  huh  what they want  it's it 
[00:31:30]  oh Jesus  come on kick it in  kick it out  but where is he  talking about  bitches  damn  chumpass  he a dumbass  call J.R.  get a fun pass  yeah she come fast  so she eat quicker  cause she come faster  me be with her 
[00:32:00]  me gym  kick it  then she would  flick her  dog  gg  with her  lamb  me  with her  lamb  okay  that was a car  oh she need liquor  never seen sicker  rap with tags  she could be  twister  had an alley  an alley  Hawaii  and Maui  Cali  the valley  up the right  notice  door  you might notice  that you type  bogus  me  I'm like  oh hopeless  and hope  is hopeless  disappear  in the air  hocus  hoches  shit 
[00:32:30]  it sounds nothing  like the original  though  it literally  sounds nothing  like the original  check the chorus  a little bit  it explodes  the chorus  down  so why have  the chorus  as an old song  make up your own  make up your own  fucking chorus  don't keep ripping off  fucking choruses  from everything  to keep it fair  Rickety Row  from Jersey writes  you guys are out of  touch with hip hop  saying fuck Jay-Z 
[00:33:00]  is like saying  fuck Led Zeppelin  hey god  somebody has  is it  I'll say fuck  words up  is it really  and then he writes  and it's just a racist  who smashes blacks  at every opportunity  alright  maybe  and both of you  are just getting old  lol  and he puts lol  so I don't know  what that's about  is that it  because let me tell you  something  hip hop's been around  for many fucking years  and when I was in my  early 20s  I fucking hated it  okay  so I don't think  age has anything  to do with it  I was listening 
[00:33:30]  to good music  the old song  like Mr. Lonely  I'm So Lonely  that old song  from the 50s  or whatever  60s  I don't know  sorry  I don't know  the song Lonely  Mr. Lonely  did Jay-Z really  hold the Lombardi  trophy last night  yeah in the music  video at the beginning  what is he doing  holding the trophy  he's representing  for the NFL  what did he do  what didn't he do  what the fuck  did he do  he introred the  Super Bowl and the  World Series this year  with his own songs  just stop  yeah he did run  this town 
[00:34:00]  you heard run  this town  run it inside out  the start of the  festivities Anthony  come on  last time  this got everybody  hyped  Rihanna  she's got a good voice  this Rihanna  and where did  this come from  I think she could  take a punch  what's this come from  this is from the  Super Bowl  this was from last 
[00:34:30]  night  this introed the  Super Bowl  this introed the  whole thing  can I just say  something  the white man  is doomed  Carrie Underwood  was there for you  oh good  good  the who  the halftime show  Carrie Underwood  and fucking aging  hip broken old men  the owners of the  teams  all right  the owners of the  luxury boxes  Steve Winwood  is a lot  yeah great  outside the  stadium  I think the 
[00:35:00]  white man was  well represented  as far as the  Super Bowl  I'm not feeling it  I'm not feeling the  owners of the team  play devil's advocate  the NFL is in a  position where they  have to get  everybody to feel  well as much as it  makes me sick to say  it they want young  blacks old white  guys country fans  everybody to feel  like yeah I'm  enjoying this whole  picture so it's  like they're trying  to throw enough  shit in it's very  rare to get one  event that everybody  watches so they're  just trying to have 
[00:35:30]  everybody watch it  anyway I think so too  everyone will watch it  without having to  fucking you know  kowtow but we'll  enjoy it a little more  kowtow to your whimsy  did uh were people  watching Jay-Z when  he had the trophy so  he wouldn't you know  run away with it  why would he he's a  millionaire billionaire  why would he run  away with it  go ahead say it  up  run away with it  there'd be no  reason for him to  do that  how great would  that be though he  just ticks off with  the trophy  what is Jay-Z doing 
[00:36:00]  security in hot  pursuit  he could purchase  the trophy  but is this worse  than Steve Wynwood  that fucking nonsense  I was never a fan  of Wynwood  but that was  completely horrendous  there was a time  where that was a  giant hit  you're right  it was  well the original  was way different  than that  why would you  bring him out  now  I understand that  yeah what does  that have to do  with anything  is this the same 
[00:36:30]  fucking song  no it's not  the same song  all black everything  right we get it  and he's right  oh my goodness 
[00:37:00]  You want to hear more of this?  Yeah.  Of course you do.  Yeah.  Hey, this is a very good point coming in from Graham in Pennsylvania.  Graham, go ahead.  Hey, Anthony.  I was calling.  I'm surprised you don't like rap more because it seems like they rap about all the same stuff you like. 
[00:37:30]  They like money, bitches, cars.  You're right.  They're so right, man.  Used to be cranking rap songs all day long.  Well, you know, I don't know.  Good point, Graham.  That's a great point.  I just like them in other people's hands.  Same shit.  That's all.  I don't know what that's supposed to mean.  All right, this is what we're going to do.  I think you do.  You really are an OG, Ant.  I'm an OG.  This is what we're going to do.  Oh, the Budweiser auto-tuning commercial was good because I think they were making fun of...  I'm living in gangsta's paradise.  Because they were making fun of auto-tuning, I do believe.

Let's talk about this damn Super Bowl.  Give us a call.  Is this the who or is it Jay-Z?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got my bitches.  I got my Benzo.  I'm with Lorenzo. 
[00:41:00]  Jay-Z with Lorenzo.  Nail.  That ain't happening.  Let's say hi to Joey in Maryland.  Joey.  Hey, guys.  How much snow did you get down there, Joey?  Three feet.  Wow, Jesus.  Yeah, they did like 38 inches down in that area.  How much did you get down in Philly?  Philly, where I was, a little over 20.  Philly itself was 28 inches.  We got none. 
[00:41:30]  But, man, they could clean that shit up because I had no problem driving back to New York yesterday  after fucking wiping off my own car.  That was a drag.  They have it all figured out.  That's weird.  People have to do that?  Really strange.  Oh, what?  Kenny wasn't around?  That's the video I filmed.  Just desperately going, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, as there's two and a half feet of snow in my car.  No, the reason, because I have a garage.  I'm lucky enough to have a garage, so I don't have to worry about the fucking snow piling up on the car. 
[00:42:00]  Joey.  Yeah.  So what were you going to say?  Joey.  Well, I was just thinking about it.  It's no different than Disturbed doing remixes of the songs.  I mean, they did Shout and Land of Confusion.  I love their Land of Confusion.  They did, no, no.  They did remakes of those songs.  They didn't just babble over them.  But at least J.D. changed the words.  New lyrics.  Yeah.  Oh, at least?  You're not supposed to.  Yeah, really.  You're supposed to keep the song how it is.  Just fucking make the song your own, but not make it your own by changing the fucking words. 
[00:42:30]  It's a reimagining, not a remake.  Reimagining?  Is that what they call it?  I imagine you're not in this fucking studio anymore.  Please tell me that's what they call it.  Well, I mean, in the movies, that's what they call it.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a reimagining.  Isn't it amazing how these fucking, how these cornballs have to change?  You're ripping off a Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what you're doing.  Just say it.  It's a reimagining.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  Observe. 
[00:43:00]  Was it just me, or did the Hoos sound like the Munsters last night?  I really, I don't know.  I would love to beat up the Hoos.  I thought they did all right.  I thought that he sounded rough.  I didn't think they were amazing, but they were all right.  And someone said, do you find it suspicious that right before Roger Daltrey screamed, they went to a long shot,  and someone, they couldn't wait through the commercials, is suggesting that maybe someone else did the big, famous Roger Daltrey scream.  Oh, the famous scream?  Could have been. 
[00:43:30]  He would have trouble screaming that.  Or he would pass out after he did that scream.  It looked like he was struggling, because maybe that's his style of singing.  Well, no.  Well, he's always cracked when he sang.  Even in his younger years, part of his whole singing style was like cracking.  His voice would crack on some of the high notes, but it would be like a good crack.  Is it possible to hear some pinball words of the original?  I'm so unfamiliar with the Hoos.  Now I'm kind of wanting to hear a good Hoos song.  It's just that he's old, man. 
[00:44:00]  Simple as that.  He just can't pull it off like he did.  It's the original?  No.  Oh, this is part two.  I want to see...  Who are you?  You who?  Boo, boo.  Boo, boo.  Boo, boo.  Let me say this, though.  That Atlantic Confusion by Disturbed is amazing.  Yeah.  I don't know why the rap artist is taking a fucking hook from a popular song,  and then doing their shit with it bothers me. 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  Let me tell you why.  Disturbed did that version of the song, made it disturbed.  Like, you heard it, and it was like,  all right, I know the song.  It's Disturbed doing it.  I could still appreciate the original version of it,  but Disturbed doing it sounds really cool.  A rap artist will take a song, completely bastardize it,  put the same generic, stupid, fucking hip-hop bullshit in there,  like I've talked about in the past,  and the song doesn't resemble the song anymore, 
[00:45:00]  and it just annoys me.  They've always done it, though.  Big Daddy Kane did it years ago with I'll Take You There,  back when I listened to hip-hop.  Yes, yes.  So they've always kind of done that.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.  All right, well, word.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Utica.  Kevin.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hi, Kevin.  I love the way they did the commercials  and target people like me with the underwears.  Oh, no. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'll start with this one.  Boo!  And then go with this one.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  This is going great.  Be more funny.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Holy shit.  That was monumental.  That was Steve Winwood's performance squared.  Jesus. 
[00:46:00]  Let's go to Joey.  Bomber Rooney.  Joey.  What's going on, boys?  Hi, Joe.  Hey, did you guys see that commercial  with the little black kid  slapping the shit out of the mother's new boyfriend  for looking at her ass?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Isn't that great?  It was just unbelievable.  A little precocious kid.  That commercial was just unbelievable.  Yeah.  All the Super Bowl commercials were...  Yeah, most were boring.  Yeah.  Hey, did you also see Townsend's baboon nose?  I mean...  Yes!  His nose is just horrendous. 
[00:46:30]  Dude, he has a fucking fat turnip nose.  I never noticed.  What a fucking monkey nose.  That fucking idiot from the professional.  With his dumb hat and his little arm swing.  We get it.  I didn't notice his fucking nose, Joey.  Holy shit.  Good point, man.  I got to see Townsend's fucked up nose.  That fucking muppet nose.  Well, he's always had a big schnoz.  Sure.  But now what is it doing?  Spreading out?  It's getting a life of its own.  It's awful.  We all know your nose just continues to grow  like your entire life. 
[00:47:00]  What a chimp nose.  Really?  Is it bad?  Dude, it's fucking horrendous.  I need a close-up of Townsend now  to see this fucking nose.  No matter what angle, yeah, you got one.  Oh, wow.  Joey, right on, brother.  Right on.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Sarah from Buffalo writes,  all the Who music made me think I was watching CBS.  I kept waiting for an episode of CSI to start.  Oh, right.  Actually, I think...  It's on CBS.  We're on CBS, yeah.  She was watching.  No, I know, but it was one big commercial for CBS  is what she's getting at. 
[00:47:30]  And the Who played three out of...  I think they played three CSI songs.  They love that Who music in CSI.  Oh, I was trying to figure out the tie-in.  Maybe that's why.  What is NCIS?  I've never seen that show.  What's that stand for?  It's the N-word.  And then...  The C-word?  Is.  What is it?  It's like I see commercials,  Cool J's on it, right?  Yeah, that's the LA version.  It's a massive show.  Naval Criminal Investigative Service. 
[00:48:00]  That's right.  Oh, it's like crimes in the Navy.  Yuck.  You could sell the seven C's in the Navy.  What kind of crimes are there?  Sailor found cum on the back of his skivvies.  Who's...  Could be anybody.  Dude, your Gene Simmons, that commercial was a little rough.  I did not hear it, man.  I saw it.  A little rough.  That's why they were in here promoting the Dr. Pepper affiliation.  I did not hear it.  And we did a gig with Mini Kiss.  I know.  So we have a connection to the Super Bowl. 
[00:48:30]  What did they say in the commercial?  What was the push of it?  I don't remember.  It was just rough.  Oh, is there a website?  They were kind of singing side by side and stuff.  So Mini Gene was singing with Big Gene.  And, uh, yeah, we could get...  Were they doing rock and roll all night?  We could get a taste of it.  They'd be good at the Super Bowl to play, though.  I want to thank Hulu.  Kiss would be a good show.  Hulu helping us out today.  Yeah, except Coca-Cola is sponsoring the advertisements.  Oh, really?  So there are ads before you see the ads. 
[00:49:00]  Coke's commercial blew fucking...  Warwell just watched this.  It's amazingly smooth because it's got a little kiss of cherry flavor.  This isn't going to work.  Oh, it's going to work.  A little kiss of cherry.  Hey, and he's...  You can't beat a little kiss.  Trust me, I'm a doctor.  You can't beat a doctor tonight. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  You know what?  Jimmy's biting himself.  It's not that.  It's all right.  I don't know why they don't get respect for their music, though.  I can't really understand why.  Dr. Love is fucking great.  He's a doctor of love.  I don't know when you're singing with fucking little midgets.  You know what would have been really cool, though?  If a midget attorney came out and a full-size attorney came out  and the Gene Simmons started suing each other.  Yeah, that would make perfect sense.  I wonder if little Gene hits on your girlfriend. 
[00:50:00]  Your little girlfriend.  Your little girlfriend.  The little version of your girlfriend.  Midget version.  Fucking Dr. Love happens to be a very good song.  That's what you do.  You call Dr. Love.  Do you?  How do you not know that?  Jimmy, I saw your face.  You can't defend that one.  I love that song.  That was a little rough.  I do love the song.  Let me say hi to James in Chicago.  James, speaking of Chicago,  the fucking Jim McMahon Super Bowl shuffle  fucking revisited commercial.  Was douche chilly.  All right, I didn't see that. 
[00:50:30]  I didn't either.  Where were you yesterday?  Playing poker.  Anthony was face down on a poker table  yelling cunt in front of his whole family.  By the way, sorry, James,  but it was great to see Anthony  and his purple wine teeth  screaming cunt at everybody.  I had my lips and tongue and everything.  I was drinking Shiraz.  He looked like Obama.  It was so fucking hilarious.  Screaming.  I think it's terrible.  I hate that.  You drink wine and it just like...  I kept going to the bathroom  and trying to like...  Did you see Obama's fucking interview  with Katie Couric? 
[00:51:00]  No.  I think Obama is starting to grow a mustache.  Really?  I don't know.  Like Billy Dee Williams?  I don't know.  He had something going on above his lip.  I'm like, what's that about?  Well, I've liked Obama very much  in the last couple weeks.  Have you?  Yeah.  Two things I've seen.  We were talking about partisan politics.  Not even his policies,  but I really fucking like what he said.  So that's not defending against the impending doom  of the Democratic Party in the 2010 election.  That's not posturing to try to make people  accept his liberal agenda. 
[00:51:30]  No.  No.  When he said it, though,  he actually said there's a difference.  He goes, I understand.  He's fine to disagree,  but there's a difference between disagreeing  and just standing in the way.  And I understand what he's talking about,  but I still feel that way about all of them.  Standing in the way.  You're all right.  You know something.  The Democrats certainly do it, too.  The Republicans absolutely should work  hand-in-hand with him and the Democrats.  And, oh, yeah, that's right, they can't  because they have closed-door meetings  about his fucking policies.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  I'm not saying that the Democrats don't do it, too. 
[00:52:00]  They filibuster.  They do the same shit.  I'm tired of it from fucking all of them.  Yeah.  I just like what he said about politics in general.  I just see it as more bullshit  coming out of his mouth.  Tell you the truth.  I see it as nothing but posturing  to try to salvage the Democrats  that are going to be swept away in November  that are separating themselves from the president.  You see people actually separating themselves.  They don't want Obama visiting  to try to help them with the election. 
[00:52:30]  They want to separate themselves  because he's too far left  and he's been going bullshit  on this whole health care issue.  and a lot of these politicians  see the American people don't want it.  They want to get re-elected.  So they're distancing themselves.  He sees it.  So now he's trying to re-posture himself  and give himself a new image  that he's the man of cooperation.  What happened to fucking your open-door policy?  What happened? 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  I still like what he said.  It's bullshit.  You can do it.  Yeah, because it applied to both.  I liked his rap tune to the Go-Go song.  Vacation or something?  Yeah, yeah.  No, the one with their lips are sealed.  Oh.  That's a good one.  Wow.  And their lips are sealed.  They're sealed.  And I just want a revolution, man.  The revolution is coming.  Man.  Sarah Palin told me.  Can't wait for the revolution.  But it's like,  would you rather have Palin running things? 
[00:53:30]  I don't hate her.  I fucking hate Palin.  She's just too conservative.  That ain't a choice.  Pro-life.  That's not a choice.  Fuck that, man.  Palin's a dummy.  No, no.  She's just going to babble for a while  and then go away when the primaries come up.  When the going gets tough.  Yeah, when it matters.  Let's say hi to this James in Chicago.  You didn't see the Super Bowl fucking commercial  with Jim McMahon in the wheelchair?  No, I didn't see that one.  Can you pop that one up?  Oh, you got that for the boys.  Hold on a second, James.  No, Bob.  We are the boost. 
[00:54:00]  Chocolate juice.  See, they're redoing the Super Bowl.  Aw, I think this is fun.  And there's Jim McMahon.  My name's McMahon, and I'll tell you what's wrong.  My tight end in a cheetah print song.  That's fresh.  Oh, my God.  This is what happens when jocks try to be funny.  Find the rest of our channel.  Oh, oh.  Wow.  They probably all watched it and pointed at each other.  Oh, shit. 
[00:54:30]  Fuck you.  Why are we closing the curtains?  Yeah, why are the curtains being closed for a McMahon?  The following is brought to you by Coca-Cola.  Oh, no, it's not.  Hold on a minute.  Who closed the curtains?  Pause that.  I'm trying to.  Come on, Bobby.  We can do it.  I'll find out.  Why are we closing the curtains?  I don't mind that, but why?  Yeah, why?  Who did it?  Sam, just yell it.  That was a major distraction.  Yes, James, go ahead.  Well, we try to figure out who's closing the curtains.  Who's closing the curtains for a fucking Super Bowl commercial. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  James.  Hey.  Couple things.  Ant, I just picked up my XDM 40 on Friday.  Oh.  And I love it.  40s are great.  Yeah.  March 2nd is a big day for Chicago.  Chicago goes to the Supreme Court for its handgun ban.  Good luck with that on the heels of D.C.  I hope you have a success.  D.C. won, right?  Well, they won.  We're kind of limited. 
[00:55:30]  They're still working on it.  But, yeah, the Supreme Court ruled that they can't just say, no, you can't own a gun under  any circumstances.  A lot of regulations, a lot of, you know, I don't even believe they can conceal carry.  You can keep it in your house, disassembled, you know, away from any ammunition.  It's a good start.  But the idea that D.C. was just saying, no, you can't.  It really is fucking annoying.  And Chicago says, no, you can't.  You know, go through all the proper channels, the checks, everything like that. 
[00:56:00]  I'm fine with that.  They're both black cities predominantly.  Why are they saying that blacks can't handle being responsible gun owners at home?  Why are they saying that black citizens in a shitty neighborhood can't defend their homes  against invasion?  But I'm saying it's like legitimate citizens who are capable of fucking, that's what they're  saying.  So you're not capable of doing it.  You're going to fuck up.  The urban areas where there is strict gun control are some of the highest crimes committed  with guns.  And it's and the law abiding citizens cannot get that's what I'm saying. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, which is is ridiculous.  It proves right there that the gun control is.  It just doesn't work how they spell it out, where it's like, keep the guns away from people.  It just won't work.  Mr. O'Neill.  How are you, my friend?  This guy again.  This guy again.  He just points to me and goes, this guy again.  What's up, Patrice O'Neill?  Oh, damn.  Good morning, sir.  Why are we closed?  I closed.  Oh, you closed him? 
[00:57:00]  I closed myself, son.  It's like watching you do a show.  What's up, brother?  Did you like the Super Bowl?  That's what we're all talking about.  The game itself was great.  Yeah.  Thanks, bro.  But the game itself is a distraction because it's such a show.  You almost don't care about the game.  But as far as football goes, it was a well-played game.  I'm losing more and more interest in it.  I'm getting less and less interested in things that don't concern me.  But I didn't have anybody that I was against. 
[00:57:30]  I was like, this whole God needs to let New Orleans win.  Right, right, right.  This kind of bugs me a little bit.  But I'm a big Peyton Manning fan.  I think he's the best quarterback that ever lived.  So I would like to see him get that, too.  He's got to win a few more balls to prove that.  One, but here's the thing.  Joe Montana is still number one.  The thing is, if he never won one, he'd still, people would be, just like Marino, they still  would argue that he's the best.  Peyton needs a couple more. 
[00:58:00]  He needs a couple more.  Yeah, Peyton did fucking blow it yesterday.  That interception was terrible.  Peyton Favre, baby.  He fucked up.  That fucking interception.  But, you know.  But the Soul Train documentary came on right when the Super Bowl came on.  It's 6 to 7.30, so it was a rough one for me.  You didn't know what to do.  Oh, man.  The history of Soul Train, it was just beautiful, man.  The history of Soul Train.  And you make a good point about New Orleans because I think it was Drew Brees was thanking  God and saying, God is good, God is all-powerful, or whatever he said at the end there.  And I'm like, really?  So I guess God really cares more about football than hurricanes. 
[00:58:30]  God was on the five to six-year plan of redemption.  It kills me how people put human time on God.  Come on, man.  The last four years, God was like, fuck New Orleans.  This is the year that I'm going to let them win for it.  Nah.  But I was not upset with it.  I wasn't upset with it.  It was whatever.  As you get older, don't you find yourself not giving a shit more?  Absolutely.  Yeah, like, who gives a shit?  The more athletes you meet, the less they are enjoyable to watch. 
[00:59:00]  Because you realize they're a bunch of dummies who think they're amusing, and they're just  dicks.  The Super Bowl in general is just overhyped at this point.  I was more impressed with Herschel Walker's body.  Oh.  Fighting.  At 48 years old.  But Dana White was on our show Friday saying that was a joke fight.  So everyone needs to relax that Herschel didn't fight anybody that has any real skill.  Okay, thanks, Dana.  Well, thank you, Mr.  He knows a little more than we do, right?  But here's what we don't need to know.  To say that this motherfucker's 48, he looks like he looks, and he is like he is. 
[00:59:30]  He doesn't have 48-year-old man muscles.  He has for real muscles.  Like, just, he's a physical specimen.  Oh, he wasn't making fun of what he looked like or anything like that.  Just that the fight was bullshit.  That he was fighting like a nobody that has no real skills.  Yeah, like, you can't go into.  Because everyone was like, oh my God, Herschel Walker won his fight.  Holy crap.  But it, you know.  You can't start fighting at that caliber at that age.  You're just not supposed to be able to do it. 
[01:00:00]  They're giving him a lot of attention just because of who he is.  It was unbelievable, man.  Oh, you saw the actual fight?  Oh, true.  I didn't see it, so.  He's a real martial artist, though.  I mean, he's like a 30-year martial artist.  Sure, sure, sure.  For years he was beating people up.  He's starting a little too late.  I mean, those guys have been doing MMA their entire lives.  And I heard you guys talking about The Who.  Yeah.  I thought that this is the rough thing about white people and their racism.  Some.  I'm like, Norton is very fair.  Yeah, Norton is. 
[01:00:30]  Norton's very fair when he's talking race.  You're very fair when he's talking race.  But you're not fair.  He's pointing at Opie, by the way.  Yeah.  Did you need to say that?  Oh, really?  I think that was obvious.  Jesus.  Like, Norton goes in trying to be fair.  Opie has a feeling.  It's either or.  He's like, fuck it.  I'm against this.  Or fuck it.  I'm for it.  There's not a, like a, like a Norton's in the middle.  You're either side.  The Jay-Z's song just bothers me.  And I don't even know why.  It just bothers me.  Because I really remember that song growing up. 
[01:01:00]  And I'm like, what the fuck is he doing with this song?  And I know that's the thing.  And a lot of rap guys are doing that.  And I just don't understand it.  I don't have an understanding for it.  More black people would disagree with white people if.  I don't even agree with the crackers in the hills.  Wow.  Fighting against the government.  Yeah.  If they didn't want to kill me, too.  Like, I'm for them.  And I'm saying, the who, I hate long, niggledy, national anthem shit. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  But the who was great.  I thought the who was great for the halftime show.  Yeah.  The crowd was really into them, man.  Usually the crowd doesn't give a shit.  And, but then you go right into sampling.  And hate in the, in the, in the.  But I'm like, I, that annoys me, too.  Yeah.  But just fucking throw in some white shit, too.  Like, just throw in.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give us, give us something so we can agree with you.  Instead of going, a zaba, zaba, zoo, zap. 
[01:02:00]  No, no, no.  And that's fucking horse shit, Roger Daltrey or whatever.  Hold on.  It was terrible.  Listen to me.  That was, that's complete bullshit.  We've done an hour, two hours, three hours on how the white man ripped off the black man  and, and the whole fucking blues thing.  We did a whole fucking thing on our show.  We really have.  We've, we've, we've, we've played both sides of this one.  All right.  I didn't hear that, that one.  Oh, yeah.  It's a legend.  It was on a Wednesday.  No, I think you might have heard some of that.  Dude, you definitely heard some of that.  I think I might have been here.  We played the Zeppelin, uh, Zeppelin stealing thing. 
[01:02:30]  Yes.  Now I want to hear Patrice finish.  Jimmy's very fair.  Opie can go either way.  Yeah.  Like Opie can go.  Now where do I fall in?  You represent complete unreasonable white guy.  Yeah.  And it's, that's what bothers me.  It's the complete, when I try to school black people into white people, like my, I try  to give him some knowledge.  I go, look, man.  Yeah.  I go, look, man. 
[01:03:00]  White people ain't fair when it comes to these artists.  It's like, you can't look to have a fair art.  Norton's very rare.  Norton will go, okay, okay.  And then, you know, you know, but you're unfair.  And then you, you get unfair racist fucking riled up like, yeah.  And then they go, doop-a-da, doop-a-da-da.  No rapper.  This is what I'm saying.  I know your white ears don't hear.  I said a boob-a-dee, boob-a-dee, boob-a-dee-boo. 
[01:03:30]  Like, don't do that shit.  Just be real when you say it sucks.  A little soft shoe.  That's all I'm saying.  Just don't be completely racist.  Be fair.  I'm being, especially music is very subjective.  This world is unfair.  Look, this world is unfair to white people in a lot of degrees.  One of them is historically.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  I always said if historically they could have, just show me a documentary.  Of good white people.  Like Ethel in 1910 who said, don't hang those niggas.  You know what I mean?  It's just a decent white boy who said, this ain't right, motherfucker.  Well, there are a couple that actually died in the civil rights movement.  But not like, here are these guys that we know, like we know Martin Luther King or Malcolm X.  I know J. Edgar Hoover, but I don't know the good J. Edgar. 
[01:04:30]  I don't know the good FBI guy that said, hey man, why would you just fuck up the Black Panthers like that?  They just feed the kids.  Like, I don't know that guy.  But you know Lincoln, you know JFK, RFK, they were real civil rights guys.  But here's how much black people hate white people.  And that's the bullet in every one of their heads.  Excellent point.  You know what?  I really did raise three fucking, three fucking hat removed.  Wow.  Anybody who's for us getting together, get smoked. 
[01:05:00]  That's true.  I will never say there should be togetherness.  Because Malcolm X, when he said fuck crackers, he lived a wonderful life.  As soon as he said, wait a minute, I think white people might, I might have been wrong.  Bow.  Get your hand out of my pocket, nigga.  And it's a wrap.  It's over.  So I'm just saying, because you be, like, Opie will go, all right, fuck that.  But then he'll go, Opie will have a feeling, like, you know, I think I'm starting to not like this Obama.  Like, first he'll go, man, Obama's cool. 
[01:05:30]  And then he'll go, maybe I don't like Obama.  Like, he's, he's, like, kind of up and down.  Yeah.  And he believes in what he believes in.  Norton goes in with an argument, like, okay, let's talk about it.  And you're just unfair.  I'm not unfair.  I, I actually did a lot of research on Obama before he really, not before he became presidential timber,  but, uh, during that time, during, during the, uh, campaign, a lot of the time, before people really knew what he was about.  Do you know why you did that?  I'm going to tell you why you did that.  Why did I do that?  You're, uh, a super intelligent human being, right? 
[01:06:00]  Thank you, sir.  And here's what white people do that my, that my girlfriend does.  Yeah.  You know, you're smart enough to, you use your powers for evil.  You do your research so that people don't say you're racist.  You'll have legitimate reasons to hate this nigga.  It's ammunition.  You're researching ammunition.  You were, you were never going to, you were never going to like Obama.  Exactly.  I mean, we all know that.  Come on.  When they say this, what's my counterpoint? 
[01:06:30]  I think Patrice makes a pretty good point.  I want to go to Trisha in Kentucky because he's, uh, she's real pissed at you, Patrice.  Why?  Trish.  Yes.  What's up, Trish?  Oh, man.  Shit.  Patrice, can you just walk on your fucking routine and just come up with something different?  Ooh.  Every fucking time you come on this show.  Can I ask you a question?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  Fucking come up with something different.  I bet her pussy's wet, too.  It sounded like it's wet.  This bitch got too much passion.  You need a finger in your asshole, bitch.  But first of all, you two, you two passionate. 
[01:07:00]  You need a motherfucker to put something right in your mouth, man.  But let me ask you a question.  How come?  Let her rant.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Why don't you call Anthony when he's talking about black people with this much passion?  Because he talks about race quite a bit.  Ooh.  Oh, see, that's a fair point.  She's annoyed with it, but you didn't.  Beautiful.  You didn't.  Honey lips.  Butterscotch.  Butterscotch.  Honey drawers.  See how unfair she's been? 
[01:07:30]  See how unfair she's been?  Honey, honey, honey, Trish, honey.  Trish, why are you so upset?  You think.  Because I'm a nigger.  Hold on.  Oh, shit.  I'm glad he said it because I was going to.  Trish, what are you trying to say?  This Kentucky white bitch, he's upset.  I know.  I want to hear it.  She's not going to tell the truth, Opie.  She's not going to say, I hate this fucking arrogant nigger.  She's going to go, because it's his show. 
[01:08:00]  What are you, a cunt?  Shh.  Trish.  What I'm trying to say is this.  Yes.  Every time he comes on the show, it ends up being about race.  Yeah, but I'll be honest with you.  It usually starts because I'm talking about it.  Well, I don't know.  And Patrice chimes in.  No, no.  This time, Patrice walked in on racial discussions.  Can I ask you a question I was listening to on the radio?  All I know is real.  Was you talking racial stuff before I got here?  Yes.  Did you listen to the show before I got here, beautiful?  I think we were talking about the Super Bowl.  I got very confused.  I'm like, wait, we're doing a black play thing. 
[01:08:30]  Are you talking about the fucking...  I was the hippity-hoopity.  The hippity-hoopity.  I might have to agree with Trish, because I think we were talking Super Bowl.  Did you hear the hippity-hop?  Yep.  You brought the racial thing up, and Anthony went on.  And then I started going off on Obama.  But did you hear that part, though, sweetie?  What part?  I heard them talking about the Super Bowl.  Did you hear them talking about hip-hop?  We were having a nice discussion about the Super Bowl.  Did you hear them talking about hip-hop?  That's all I heard.  I heard the Super Bowl. 
[01:09:00]  Yep.  You didn't hear hip-hop, exactly, because you listen with white racial ears.  You're an asshole.  White racial ears.  You're a fucking liar.  You just need to say you don't like this nigga's shit.  It's on your rules.  It's by your way.  It's your way or the highway.  That's historical white shit, lady.  You're not fair.  You're not having a conversation.  You're just being a dick.  You said Anthony can say what he wants, because it's his show.  That's not even the context, dummy.  I like the way she thinks.  The fucking context is Anthony can do what he wants and say what he wants, 
[01:09:30]  but you come in with your bullshit.  Shut the fuck up.  You're an asshole.  You're a fuck, and you need a man,  because nobody with a happy fucking life is this passionate about shit that don't concern you.  You're really angry.  You need a fucking hug.  You're here anyway.  Hold on.  Trish, what does he need?  He needs to work at his job and come up with something original to talk about.  Oh, really?  Besides the color of his fucking skin. 
[01:10:00]  Really?  Have you ever heard?  Did you hear that his?  That his sounded a lot like nigger.  That's not like that's what you want to say to him.  Hey, listen.  Can you do me a favor?  Can you call?  Can you call?  Can you call?  Can you?  Can you call one of your black friends and have them call?  And you can talk.  Listen.  Listen.  How many black friends do you have?  Can you call?  Miss, can you call one of your black friends so we all can talk about what a fair person you are? 
[01:10:30]  No, because my black friend is at work actually contributing to refining and not talking about the color of her skin.  Well, what do you, what, you're one black friend and we're, and you're home.  My black friend.  And you're, oh, yeah.  Do you have a job?  Of course I have a job.  I'm on my way to it now.  Of course, because why?  You're white?  Miss, you just, you don't even understand how unfair and how completely racial you are.  Have you ever heard Patrice's act, though?  It's not all based on race. 
[01:11:00]  You say work on your routine.  Have you ever heard him talk about relationships and shit like that?  Jimmy goes, have you ever heard the other 75 million times I've been on the show and it wasn't racial?  And most of the time we turn it off.  Because I.  Because I.  I'm going to let her talk.  God damn it.  Why are you being fair to this white girl?  Because I want to hear what she has to say.  She's saying nothing.  She's already saying.  So just yell over.  Yes, I want to.  I would like to.  See, you call me a nigga too, Opie. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, damn.  Oh, now we're calling him a nigger.  Oh.  See, that's why you let her talk.  There you go.  I know what I'm doing.  She said it.  I know what I'm doing.  All I've said is that he needs to work on his routine and it has blown up now to me and Opie calling Patrice a nigger.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's smart, too.  She's strong drama, Chris.  And that's the art smart she is?  I know.  This is what I mean.  Using your intelligence for evil.  She got a way to say nigger.  Talk about something else.  To make it not like it's her fault. 
[01:12:00]  Now it's fine.  She was just commenting.  I'm not going to win.  And I don't want to win.  I just wanted to say.  All right, listen.  Let's talk about something else.  You're what?  You win already.  Hey, hey, hey, let me ask you a question.  Who's some of your favorite black entertainers that you really enjoy?  Oh, okay.  Like comics?  Eddie Murphy.  Eddie Griffin.  You.  I love your stand-up.  When you come on the show, though, it's like you lose your mind and all you want to talk about and it's a point out.  All right, let me just.  You are.  Let me jump in finally here. 
[01:12:30]  I mean, in all fairness to Patrice, yeah, this show does do a lot of black, white stuff when Patrice is in here.  But Patrice was hanging outside, minding his own business.  Then I remember now and it was doing what we're talking about, Obama or something, something about the black man.  And then Patrice starts shaking his head outside the studio, so I went, come on in, Patrice.  Come on in.  Nah, but I think she's right, though.  He just kind of came in with the race stuff.  Yeah, that's your question, man.  I think me and Anthony have very productive racial conversations.  Yeah, I think we do.  But I can't believe somebody would call as racist as you are and curse me out. 
[01:13:00]  I'm racist because all I'm saying is.  I didn't call you racist.  No, no, no.  See how you're listening with the wrong ears, baby?  You're a mess.  You're the white ears.  This is not about your whiteness.  You're a fuck.  Yeah, you are.  But you are lonely.  This is the rantings of a retarded woman.  You got a lot of cats and books that are doing you no justice, man.  You just, I, I, I, I'm, I'm not lonely. 
[01:13:30]  I have a very loving relationship with my husband.  I don't have cats.  Really?  Who are you trying to fool me?  Or you?  Black man.  I don't believe you.  I don't believe you at all.  Why don't you come to freaking Florence, Kentucky and all this?  Why?  So I can fucking be hanging from the tree in your backyard, you dummy?  Sweetie, don't try different levels of trying to get through to me.  I already know what y'all are.  I know what y'all are.  I know what y'all are.  You're a mess.  You know what I am. 
[01:14:00]  What's up?  You're an angry, mean, you're one of those old white ladies that was in the back when  the kids was trying to go to Alabama University, just with a sign and frothing mouth.  You're just a frothing at the mouth old white woman, man, that wants it to be the same.  You just want it to be the same.  You live in shitty, nobody heard of Kentucky.  Who does that except for a racist?  Stop it.  Trisha, you a racist?  Of course she is.  No, I'm not.  Are you racial?  Uh, no, I'm not.  Right.  Yeah, nice big, uh, to think about it.  Look at me, just go to work. 
[01:14:30]  Go to work at your non-racial job.  Oh, we were talking about gun control.  That's what brought up the black people.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, but it really wasn't racial.  She's right.  I love fucking Jimmy.  All right, Petrini.  Jimmy is an instigating motherfucker.  All right, Trish, thanks.  All right, Trish, thank you.  Thanks for the call.  Get out of here.  There she goes.  Get out of here.  You know, talk all the shit on YouTube all day long.  That's what kills me.  That's what I mean.  I'm not here to be, I'm not letting motherfuckers be unfair by lying.  If they tell the truth, I'll roll with it.  But the thing is, you go in there, there's a bunch of bobos. 
[01:15:00]  There's a bunch of fucking Wesley Snipes.  There's a bunch of this.  There's a whole show of me talking about sampling.  When you let me take over the show, the whole show is about how sampling motherfuckers  and shit, but this is what racial white is here.  She just heard.  She's unfair.  The racial part.  And she don't give a fuck.  She lives in Kentucky and like, they're fucking belly-yanking niggers.  It's the whole shit.  Shut the fuck up.  She's a phony racist.  A fake.  Like, I'd rather just confront a real live racist. 
[01:15:30]  Someone that admits to it and just goes, yeah, I prejudge.  I absolutely prejudge people.  Exactly.  Based on their ethnic heritage.  Not just black people, but everybody.  There you go.  I'm xenophobic.  I don't really like being with people of other ethnic backgrounds.  I don't feel I can relate to them as well as I can people of my own ilk.  That's just the way I am.  But then, you know something?  I always surprise myself.  Which some of your ilk is more, by the way. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, I know.  A lot of more in your ilk.  A lot of more.  Some ilk.  I do have a mixture of ilk.  I just know, at least you're talking honest shit.  That's what I'm saying.  When you talk to somebody that mad, right?  And a lot of them will be that mad.  You get that mad, but you don't admit your anger has anything to do with being racial.  Where's my argument?  Then I'm talking about the Loch Ness Monster.  It don't exist. 
[01:16:30]  Exactly.  Now you get shut down.  I'm the racist.  Yeah.  So isolate that.  Let's go to Tom in Madison.  Tom, what's going on, buddy?  Buddy, how's it going?  Hey, Tom.  Hey, I tell you what.  Me and my truck driver buddies, we love it when Patrice comes on because of the racial,  or partially because of the racial discussion.  What would be nice in the real world out here is if more people fucking heard it.  And, you know, you could get on network TV and talk as frank and honest as you guys do 
[01:17:00]  because they prettied up so much and, oh, you know, rainbow this, happy, happy, joy, joy that.  And that ain't fucking real.  That is not real.  And you guys at least bring it down to plain speak, real world, and we get perspectives on it that you don't hear.  We get real world perspectives.  Be nice if more people heard it.  All right.  Right on, brother.  And I will say, I do get pleasantly surprised when I do sit down with people of other ethnic backgrounds  and I find common ground and I talk and I go, you know something?  That's a cool motherfucker. 
[01:17:30]  And then I sit and I go, you know, my preconceived notion was wrong.  But I'll always go into something with a preconceived notion.  I'll always go into a Chinese restaurant going, oh, here we go.  I will.  You know what I do?  And this is every day.  I don't care what color you are.  We all fucking do that shit.  I get, here's two issues I have with Asians.  I get a fucking knot in my stomach when I call for delivery on the phone 
[01:18:00]  because I know it's going to be a chore to try to get them my address, my order.  It's a fucking anxiety attack waiting to happen.  What?  And no, no.  And they're like, the town, what town?  No, no, no.  All right.  What order?  All right.  I need two egg rolls.  I need wontons.  Wait, what do you need?  Two egg rolls.  No, start over.  I am starting to go, shit.  And the thing is, it's not that you're having trouble. 
[01:18:30]  It's that they don't, and this is what I mean about liars.  They don't even do you the courtesy of saying to you, sorry.  Yes.  I don't, you know I'm Chinese and I don't get it.  So, they get angry because they don't understand what you're saying.  Exactly.  You should order in symbols.  They get mad.  It should just be, not even numbers, symbols.  And the address symbols.  I'd like a dragon with no onions.  I'd like a dragon. 
[01:19:00]  I'd like a rice paper wall.  I'd like a yin-yang sign.  I'd like a yin-yang sign.  Because they fuck up the number thing, too.  Patrice's take on Chinese restaurants.  You said something once on our show that still makes me laugh,  where you go to the same Chinese restaurant over and over again.  And I can relate to this living in New York.  You go to the same restaurants.  They get to know you, and every once in a while,  they'll throw you a free appetizer, a free glass of wine, free dessert,  just to go, you know what?  I see your face so fucking much. 
[01:19:30]  Thank you for coming to my joint.  Here's a little something to acknowledge that.  Don't do it with a fork.  Extra fork, no charge for you.  Like, really?  Thank you.  These fucking Asian restaurants won't even give you a goddamn egg roll  after fucking years of service.  No buybacks.  No buybacks to these fuckers.  No buybacks.  They don't care.  They're like, you want it?  Pay for it.  If you're not, fucking go eat Italian.  It's just amazing to me, though.  Travis in Kentucky.  Travis?  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Drew said he wanted to talk to a true racist.  Well, he's got one.  Go ahead, boss.  Get whatever the hell you want.  I don't have any questions.  He knows.  What the fuck are you talking about?  What kind of rope do you use on my neck, nigga?  The fuck are you talking about?  I'm here.  Let me ask you a question.  Here's a question I like to have.  Listen, true racist.  Let's listen to Travis.  That's fair.  That's fair.  On a historical level, Travis.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because you know that, I mean, to digress a little bit,  you know that intelligent black people think guys from where you are  are below intelligent, right? 
[01:20:30]  But that's not true, right?  Well, see, the problem is I'm actually not even from there.  I've moved down there for, I don't know, just to get out of where I was.  To seem smart?  Yeah.  So here's the question.  And what has black people done to white people for white people to hate us so much?  Not what they've done to you, but what we've done as a people to make white people just hate us so much. 
[01:21:00]  I think we've been very fair in this country.  If I can answer a question for somebody else, I can answer one for myself.  I'm not going to sit there and generalize like you guys.  Oh, so you have a fucking actual reason why you hate all black people?  Oh, yeah, pretty much.  Okay.  Let her in.  Okay.  Well, where I'm originally from is up by Flint, Michigan.  And if you know that area, every goddamn time I go to school or I go trying to get a fucking job  or I try to do any of that shit, I lost a $135,000 a year job because we weren't racially biased, 
[01:21:30]  or it wasn't, I guess, a racially biased company.  So they had to hire in people of a different race.  Number one, I lost my job along with six other people.  And five people that weren't even qualified got the job.  There's one good reason.  Now, can I get, now let me retort on this, Travis.  I will say, I will say that I agree that that shouldn't be the case.  But to be fair, and I'm asking you to be fair, don't you think that there was a place in time 
[01:22:00]  where I couldn't get a job based on the same reason that you lost your job,  which is I don't have to hire niggas.  I guess I'll never will, but there had to be something to make it a little bit fair for a qualified black person.  You don't have to even out history.  History doesn't have to all of a sudden be evened out throughout history.  If something happened, it doesn't necessarily mean down the road you've got to equal out the seesaw. 
[01:22:30]  Anthony, you didn't hear me.  I agree it shouldn't have to be that kind of thing, but there was no historical...  This is what I'm saying about the presidency.  You're a man of the people.  I'm a man of the people.  Everybody's out there.  When did you feel like this country has changed internally to basically hire a black president?  I have never seen, unless you've been forced to not be racist externally,  when is the internal change? 
[01:23:00]  Is it when?  That's what I'm saying, where people go,  hey, Lynn, let's just end this bullshit and not be racial.  Like, he's mad because of some external reason,  but internally, what has black people ever done to you?  Even the black people who got your job because they were black,  they didn't do anything to you personally, Travis.  Oh, I don't have a job now than they do.  That's pretty fucking personal.  It was probably a white guy that fired you, right?  No, actually, no, it wasn't. 
[01:23:30]  The white guy that was my boss got fired six weeks earlier,  and there's a black guy in his position now.  So, no, it wasn't.  So, this is just the plight of the white man.  This is a white man dealing with unfairness.  Were you racist before this happened, or is it just based on this personal experience?  A lot of it's where I grew up.  I don't know if you guys know anything about Michigan.  I kind of grew up in the heart of Michigan militia and Ku Klux Klan country.  Oh, okay.  It's kind of been there. 
[01:24:00]  Well, see, I could blurt out immediately my major malfunction,  and it is the disproportionate amount of crime in the black community  that really uses up a lot of resources, prison space, court time, police that have to be out there,  just because there is such a disproportionate amount of crime in the black community  than there is in the white community.  It is, and I want to know, why the fuck? 
[01:24:30]  Why the fuck?  How about a little assimilation, a little fucking, you don't have to fucking have this ridiculous idea of street cred.  Get yourself a fucking job and work your way up through it.  You're not going to start as the president of IBM.  And then if you've got to work at McDonald's, and then a friend goes,  oh, no, you can make some real money slinging dope,  and then that's what they do, sling dope instead of doing the right thing. 
[01:25:00]  Is that different for white people, though?  That's what I'm saying.  You qualify that with black.  It's disproportionate.  It's going to always be disproportionate because there's 300 million white people.  But why?  If a million white people and a million black people do the same thing, right?  Yeah.  A million black people is still a million.  A million white people is still a million.  If there was 300 million black people and 300 million white people  and the fucking figures were off the chart, then there's an argument. 
[01:25:30]  But there's only 30 million black people, but there's still the same number of assholes in every group.  There's a million fucking white boys.  You watch MSNBC.  Same dumb motherfuckers doing the same dumb shit.  But it's not 50% of the prison population.  10% of the population making up 50% of the prison population.  And that's what I'm saying to you, is that your facts is based on the number.  If there's 10 black people and 30 white people, right?  Yeah.  Five black people do some fucked up shit.  Yeah.  That means half of us are fucked up. 
[01:26:00]  But if five white people do some shit, all white people are less apt.  It's just more motherfucking white people.  But it's numbers.  But then our crime rate should be a lot higher.  It is.  As on average, taking into consideration the number of people.  Like per capita, let's say.  It should be equal.  Anthony, it shouldn't be equal unless it was an equal amount of people.  You're talking the exact opposite.  Like let's say black crime was lower proportionally percentage-wise. 
[01:26:30]  Then I'd buy your argument.  I think it's the same number.  No.  The same number of people.  And here's another thing, too, that you get, that white people get to be, I love this.  You get, you get this.  Okay.  You don't have to, right?  See, this argument should be me going, and what's your point?  Now, white people don't ever have to associate themselves with any criminal white guy.  So that means, so when you get a serial killer here and a pedophile here, you go, first thing 
[01:27:00]  you think of is a white boy, but white people don't go, oh, we're pedophiles.  It's reflecting on, right, right, white people.  It's like some goofy motherfucker that's broke trying to sell drugs.  Because it's too, it's too, there's too many.  If it was just a few, and most black guys were, you know, this guy up here doing the  weather, there's a bunch of motherfucking black weather dudes.  Of course, but you know what?  There's a bunch of black prisoners and a bunch of black fucking drug dealers. 
[01:27:30]  And a bunch of Mexicans and a bunch of white people.  And a bunch of fucking black dead guys that are killing other fucking, killed by other  blacks.  He's saying it's like one in five, as opposed to one in 50.  That's the point he's making.  It's too many.  But it's one in 50 white guys.  And that's what makes people prejudge.  Because it fucking is one in 50.  But it makes people prejudge when it's 50% of the prison population.  But you're getting your shit from...  FBI statistics?  Statistics.  You're not getting it from people, man.  You're just, look, that's what I'm saying.  That's the thing.  You're getting your shit from television. 
[01:28:00]  I'm not saying every black guy out there is a thug.  But you might as well be, because you don't give us the benefit of the doubt.  So, put it this way.  You don't give the benefit of the doubt in the positive way.  See, I don't walk by every white guy and goes, oh, here we go.  This nigga gonna chop me up and eat me.  We don't do that.  Every hooker's not afraid of white guys.  They love white guys.  You talk about skinheads and shit like that.  If you see fucking skinheads walking down the street, that's what I'm talking about.  But that's the...  See, here it is, Anthony.  That weather guy walking up the street to you.  Right.  If he's not on the TV doing weather. 
[01:28:30]  I'm going, howdy, sir.  He's still a nigga.  I know.  White guys, and this is why having a racial conversation with you is fun, because at least  you're racist.  If you don't dress up with a swastika tattoo carved in your head, or shaved, or you're not  like a fucking guy who just says, I hate niggas, racism doesn't exist. 
[01:29:00]  So I only can have a conversation, a racial conversation with a fucking racist.  Right, right, right.  I can't have a racial conversation with a white guy that just thinks horribly black people.  Because it's camouflaged.  It's horseshit.  Yeah, yeah.  White people are not honest on this level, man.  Well, I'll agree with you.  You know?  And I'm trying to be honest and tell you why people are racist, and why they have racist  ideas in their head.  If a nigga had this face...  Oh, that guy's fucking crazy.  He's...  But look at how you go...  Look at that white guy. 
[01:29:30]  That guy's crazy.  That guy's crazy.  A corporate face is completely tattooed.  But you know, associate with him.  If there was a black guy with this on his face, and kill Whitey, for some reason, and  I wish I didn't have to.  I would have to defend...  I can't relate to that guy.  Can we get back to the Asians, please?  Yes, the driving.  Blue Nut Joe.  Blue Nut.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Go to a Chinese restaurant.  Next time you go to a Chinese restaurant, ask the waiter for a knife.  They will freak out on you. 
[01:30:00]  They will fight with you.  They will argue with you.  And when they get into the kitchen, they'll lose it.  They'll lose it in the kitchen and probably spit in your little knife.  They don't want to give you anything extra.  Fucking bayonet.  Comes out with a bayonet charging at you.  They want to give you the cheap chopsticks that they can just throw away.  They don't have to fucking wash nothing.  Ah, that's true.  You know, I didn't even think of that.  I'm telling you, man, there's one agent joining my neighborhood.  Not one fucking free egg roll in all these years of service.  Just a chopstick.  They'll never give you anything free. 
[01:30:30]  But their argument is that, why do you need a knife?  Everything is cut.  Just please insist on the knife, and you will cause chaos.  I am going to do that today.  Today I go to the Chinese restaurant.  Thank you, Balloon.  Now let's go to Mike the Trucker.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  More racist about Asians.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, listen.  I just wanted to comment on all this racist shit going on, okay?  When I was over there in Iraq, I didn't give a shit what color the other guy was.  As long as he picked up a weapon and fought as hard as I did, that's all that mattered to me. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, certain situations, obviously, are going to make, you know, the band of brothers kind of thing come together.  Super Bowl.  Yeah, at the Super Bowl.  Right.  Remember that?  Remember that's what we were talking about?  Remember?  But I just, you know, I was raised out in Oklahoma around a bunch of trailer park trash, and all I ever heard my whole life being shoved down my throat was, you know, it's our problem that we're poor because the black man's taking all the jobs or the Mexican man or whatever.  But, you know what, we have to be mad enough in ourselves to rise above all this bullshit and say, you know what, I'm going to better myself as an individual and not look at people solely based on race. 
[01:31:30]  I work for a company out of Memphis that's 90% black.  I get treated just like everybody else does, you know?  So, I mean, I can't get there.  What, beat up?  Yeah.  What company is this?  What company is this, sir?  What kind of a company is it, sir? 
[01:32:00]  See?  Had to have steel in there.  That was awful, man.  What is this?  What is this dummy corporation that's hiding a drug dealer's money?  All right.  You know all his friends laugh at him?  How's your boss doing? 
[01:32:30]  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Bye, Mike.  We're going to take a quick break.  We can continue with this, do a little Super Bowl and some other shit.  Oh, my God.  Black History Month.  Yes.  It'll be over soon.  It's going to be a quiet month.  It is very quiet.  You haven't heard much.  Perfect spot for this.  You do more.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is paying tribute to those  legendary African Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is  today.  Today, we honor Plaxico Burris.  This intrepid gridiron legend shot himself in the foot in a nightclub in 2008 and simultaneously 
[01:33:00]  shot his team in the foot by missing the last four games of the NFL season.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, we got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  We're going to have Chris Mad Dog Russo from Mad Dog Radio on the show in about an hour. 
[01:33:30]  I'm sure he's going to talk a little Super Bowl with us.  Of course he is.  What did you think of the Super Bowl, Patrice?  I thought it was one of the entertaining ones.  I thought the emotion went from start to finish.  I thought that...  It was all bullshit to you?  No, it was cool.  Like, what about the...  Obviously, the commercials were completely lame.  I don't expect you to like them at all.  I hated them.  I think most people thought they fell short.  I don't even get into that no more. 
[01:34:00]  I don't get it.  We said it last year.  We said last year, I'm almost positive.  We said, look, it's over.  The commercial thing with the Super Bowl is over.  So why are we still focusing on that?  I think we get a certain age.  I think everybody in this room, maybe except for young Sam, is at the age of disgust for anything.  We just...  It's like, really, anything...  We're anti-anything that anybody...  Like, American Idol, I'm anti-American Idol just because everybody loves it.  You know, I don't know if it's an age thing.  I think it's that we remember how it used to be... 
[01:34:30]  Well, I guess that would make it an age thing, right?  We remember when the fucking commercials were really edgy and made you go, holy shit, you  see what they did last night during the Super Bowl?  You don't get any of that.  When life was good.  When life was good.  None of this political correctness shit.  But were they great back then or did we just not have other things to compare them to?  Man, me and Joe Green's fucking Coca-Cola commercials just...  That was great.  Hey, kid, it's just...  Everything is a little bit...  I mean, even the game itself, I don't enjoy as much because, you know, when I played, you 
[01:35:00]  know, when people got hurt, you know, paralysis was one of the fun parts of the game.  Like, you wanted to fucking hurt somebody when they didn't move and we didn't get in huddles  and pray with the other team.  No, you got them souped up.  It's Halloween, y'all!  I like Patrice's point, though.  All of a sudden, there's an injured player down and now the other team is now praying  for him, too.  Well, everyone's praying. 
[01:35:30]  I mean, you're not sitting there jumping up and down, but it's his problem and that team's  problem.  But before you know he's paralyzed, you would do a hump dance, a choreograph.  Oh, yeah.  He could be just...  He could be paralyzed dance.  And then when he's paralyzed, you go, oh, damn, man.  I'm sorry, man.  I hear that.  But when we hit you, the whole point...  Like, there's a horse collar rule now.  You can't drag a guy down by the back of his neck.  How do I get T.O. down if I can't climb on his neck?  Wait, what is that called?  It's a horse collar rule where you can't grab a guy by the back of his neck and just fucking 
[01:36:00]  fall down.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You see the shot Shockey took last night?  No.  It looked like they almost took his head off.  Yeah, his helmet came off.  Beautiful.  Holy shit.  Beautiful.  That's what football's about.  His helmet didn't come off.  Maybe it was another play then.  His helmet came halfway off, I think.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  But they almost took his fucking head off.  Can't hit the quarterback?  You can't hit a receiver who's helpless?  That's the best time.  Man, I agree with you.  I mean, I'm a big hockey fan, and when that goalie is out of the crease, you really can't 
[01:36:30]  fuck with him anymore.  Old days, you would knock him right on his ass.  Put him on his ass.  And then, guess what?  It makes it a lot easier to score when you're fucking the goalie up.  But it makes him think if he should go out of the crease or not.  The guys are also a lot bigger and stronger now, too, though.  So if you didn't have certain rules, a lot more guys would probably get paralyzed.  Right.  Because 20 years ago, they were strong.  These guys are fucking animals.  In hockey, it doesn't make any sense, because the goalie doesn't need to leave the crease.  And now, all of a sudden, if the goalie leaves the crease and you hit him, all hell's going 
[01:37:00]  to break loose.  It doesn't make sense.  It forces the goalie to really think about it before he leaves that damn crease.  Yeah, here's all the guys getting fucking hit.  Can I kill that a little bit, Sam?  Hey, what about...  What was your take on the Letterman-Leno-Oprah commercial?  Does that give you a little holy shit moment?  No, that gives you that money buys anything it wants to buy.  It buys you, you pay them, and they'll do what they're told to do. 
[01:37:30]  They're fucking corporates.  What I liked about it was the fact that in this...  I was going to say in this day and age, I don't know how they kept that secret.  They said that Jay was walked right into the front of the theater...  With a fake mustache.  After the fucking...  Well, he had sunglasses and a hoodie.  Right.  After Letterman's taping, everyone's waiting around the side, and they walk him in through  the front of the head cellar.  Not even after.  While the show was taping, they got him in, and then they put him in what's called a secret  green room.  There's an article online about the whole damn thing. 
[01:38:00]  They flew Oprah in separately.  They flew Leno in separately.  Leno walked in, like Jimmy said, with a hoodie and a fake mustache.  I don't know how they hid that fucking head of his, but they did it.  No good deed goes unpunished, man.  And what I mean by that, Conan, for having his fucking integrity, is on the outside looking  in.  That's what I'm saying.  Fucking Leno, who just...  Yeah, I know that's your boy, Naughty, but it's just...  What the fuck, man?  What he did, what he should have done.  They offered him the show back, and he took it back. 
[01:38:30]  It's not what he should have done.  Sure it is.  Why not?  Are you going to step aside for somebody, someday?  I might, if I have a zillion dollars.  When you're still on top?  I might have...  How do you step aside if you're still on top?  I don't give a shit about the money part.  Why did he leave 1130 anyways?  He was forced to.  He was forced to five years ago.  They forced him to leave five years ago.  2004.  They came to Jay, and they said, in 2009, because Conan was going to leave for it on  the network, so they said, don't leave, we'll give you the Tonight Show in 2009.  So Jay's number one. 
[01:39:00]  They say, you're leaving in 2009.  He goes, okay, and then he acts like he wants to retire.  And Conan gives the same phony lie.  Like, hey, I'm going to be patient.  They both gave the company lie.  He was forced out.  Well, I'll tell you what.  And he was still number one.  That's the problem.  Five years seems like a long time when they tell you.  Five years, you go, ah, it's five years.  Ah, it's so far down the road.  And then all of a sudden it hits you, and five years goes by, and you're like, wait, I don't  want to leave.  If more hits you, then you're still number one in the time to leave.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Conan, there's a lot of people that have took that 1205.  Yeah, I think Conan should have fucking hung in there. 
[01:39:30]  I think that would have been a good move.  I think he made the right move is take none, then take less.  But at the end of the day, that move is dumb.  It's the right move if he shows up somewhere else.  In the context of this business, the right move is always the wrong move.  And Fox isn't jumping up and down saying we're definitely going to hire Conan.  Yeah, they might not.  They're starting to talk about, well, we'd like to, but we're not sure if we could.  That could be a negotiating tactic, though.  Yeah, we'll see.  Can we make money off him?  We don't know if we can make money off him. 
[01:40:00]  You know, that's just negotiating.  But wasn't the Leno Letterman thing just nothing?  No emotion, Patrice?  The Leno Letterman?  When you saw it, like, holy shit, how the fuck did they get this done?  No, because they fucking, they put sale.  What's the, like, okay, I'm not being a douche about it, but what is the shocking thing?  That any of them would have, fuck, there's a dignity call there?  Oh, no, I don't give a shit about any of that stuff.  The fact is that these guys haven't been seen together in fucking 20-some-odd years, man. 
[01:40:30]  Because no one offered the correct money to put them together.  I get it.  I get that part of it.  Shit.  I'll be honest.  I wonder if this was a big money thing.  I think Leno probably did it because his image took a beating.  And this is a way for both of them to go, like, all right, the bullshit is done.  And I'm sure Letterman in some way took a beating for it because he said some love with them.  Why did Oprah come in?  She's like a honey child.  She's a bedwower.  What do you call that?  Peace broker.  She breastfeeds both of them?  I don't get it.  No, you're missing the obvious.  You're missing the obvious.  Two or three years ago, Letterman and Oprah did this type of commercial. 
[01:41:00]  The same one.  So they're kind of going back to that theme.  Oh, they did?  And they added Leno.  Oh, that was forgettable then.  Because who the hell remembers that?  Yeah, it was just Oprah and Dave checking out the Super Bowl together.  Was it Chicago in the Super Bowl or something?  Is that why I was...  I don't remember.  Chicago, Indianapolis, am I wrong?  I don't remember, to be honest with you.  Oh, it might have been the last time the Colts ran because, yeah, Letterman's got that Indianapolis angle.  Yeah.  To the whole guy.  Yeah, he's a Colts fan.  And someone asked...  Oh, here's the original.  I went to Colts, but we...  What year?  You went to Bears and I went to Colts, but we both win because we're in love. 
[01:41:30]  Honey, don't talk with your mouth full of...  I'm sorry.  Wow.  It's a takeoff on that.  And she didn't stop eating chips after that commercial.  Holy shit, did she get bigger.  Wasn't there a thing like that they didn't like each other back then?  That's kind of why that worked, I guess.  That's right.  They had a little issue.  At the time, they had an issue.  And then you saw that.  And the Oprah Uma thing that he did during the Academy Awards.  But someone asked what this commercial was for. 
[01:42:00]  Was it for Dave's show?  Was it Doritos?  Was it for CBS?  What was it for?  No, I'm Letterman, really.  It was for Letterman technically, but it promoted both of them.  This is the worst Super Bowl party ever.  Now, Dave, be nice.  Well, he's just saying that because I'm here.  Well, he can say that because I'm here.  I think they could have wrote it a little better.  Yeah, right?  Right, wrote something.  I mean, you got those two guys together.  I mean, it was good, obviously.  Everyone's talking about it.  But I think they could have got another line or two in. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I think so.  I wonder if they talked at all.  And, dude, you know, we don't have real friends in this business.  We know a lot of the Letterman people.  You know Letterman people and Leno people, and not one of these fucking guys giving us  a little hint that this was going down.  I bet you none of them knew.  I bet you Jay's people knew.  Jay's a smart dude.  That's why he fucking is where he is.  He's not a blabbermouth.  He knows when to keep his mouth shut.  They probably just flew him in, went in, shot, and left.  He's not a dope.  He doesn't have to call people and go, guess what I'm doing?  Right.  And they did.  Twitter is.  The commercial took 20 minutes to film, and then they were out of there. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  They were fucking out of there.  But I wonder if they talked, if they shook hands, or if they just stayed away from each other.  A little pleasantries.  Not much, though.  You think?  Yeah.  There's a whole article on it.  Slight pleasantries.  Slight pleasantries.  Very professional, they said.  And they did their thing, and that was it.  They didn't hang around and fucking have a cigar together either.  And you don't give a fuck.  None of us give a fuck.  Like, after you watch it, you go, you know who gives a fuck?  It's like people go, oh my God, I can't believe they're together.  But you just go, who gives a shit?  Who cares?  I like the fact that it came out of nowhere. 
[01:43:30]  Because it's so hard to keep anything a secret in entertainment.  So for this, it was like, holy crap.  I like if they were impressive.  Pan down, and Oprah's just giving both of them a hand job.  I would like that a lot.  Both hands out, just jacking them off.  I wonder if Conan wasn't allowed to do it.  Probably.  I bet you they reached out to him.  I bet you.  No, they douched him off.  They probably got a little, yeah, he can't do shit for, that's why you haven't seen him.  He's a ratings loser.  And they just dumped him off.  He walked off with 40 million or whatever it was, but that also means you can't talk for a while. 
[01:44:00]  That's why you haven't seen Conan.  He'll be back a couple of years on Fox.  Not even a couple.  He's allowed to start back up six, seven months from now.  Jimmy Kimmel tore into Leno.  I love that shit.  I fucking love that, man.  Oh, he was just being a dick.  But I love the fact that Jay allowed it.  That was a pre-taped piece.  They could have said, you know what, fuck that.  We're not doing that.  Fair enough.  I mean, if Jay's the guy that's taking all this attack and stride, I'm down with him.  Yeah, he seems to. 
[01:44:30]  He must just look at, like, think of all his cars and his bank account and go, fuck you.  And this is what's going to make out on everybody.  Jeff Zucker.  He'll get a promotion after just fucking it all up.  Exactly.  Jeff Zucker will fucking, he fails all the way to the top.  He'll be God next year.  His next debacle, he'll be right under God.  He'll be Jesus' assistant fucking around.  Like, he does nothing but bad things ever since Tartakov's gone.  Yeah, yeah.  NBC's selling, uh, their, uh, Comcast is buying NBC. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And they're buying, Comcast is not buying it for NBC.  NBC is part of this whole big conglomerate.  Yeah.  And it's like, okay, we have to buy it.  Ah, we gotta take this to it.  But they're buying it for USA, Bravo.  Mm-hmm.  Those companies make more money.  Of course, yeah.  Than fucking NBC.  And I'll bet you Comcast is why the whole shake-up took place.  Because Leno had two years guaranteed.  I'm sure Conan had a couple years guaranteed as the Tonight Show host.  But when NBC, when Comcast came in, I guarantee you that was them going, no, no. 
[01:45:30]  This is how it's going to be.  And that's why Zucker changed it.  Fucking.  Management can fuck up royally.  And they never get fired, dude.  And just keep their jobs.  Everyone else gets their fucking head cut off and thrown out of the building.  And management just goes, well, all right, let's try this.  And it just ended up so well.  What a package.  Did you see the, moving on a little bit, did you see the Tim Tebow commercial?  The pro-life?  The abortion thing?  No.  Well, there was all this controversy.  And then the commercial runs.  And it was like, who gives a shit commercial?  Oh, I know what I was doing. 
[01:46:00]  I was turning back and forth between the fucking Soul Train thing and the Super Bowl.  Who's Tim Tebow?  I just wanted to see that.  He played for the Gators.  He's like one of the greatest college quarterbacks ever.  Oh, they're trashing.  They're trashing.  Plus the fact they don't even know how he's going to be able to play in the NFL because his game's a little different than the NFL game.  Dude, they're trashing his game, brother.  I've never heard people say he sucks so bad, man.  I mean, the college game and the NFL games are very different.  I guess, but they are trashing that motherfucker. 
[01:46:30]  Is it time for him to go to the NFL?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Someone's going to pick him up, but they're not.  Seventh round, they're talking about.  Maybe.  I know, which is insane because he won, you know, the championship.  Two championships.  Two championships.  Two Heisman Trophy.  He's arguably the greatest college player of all time.  He's in the conversation.  But his game is just very different.  What's his game like?  Well, he runs a lot and stuff like that.  And in the NFL, you're going to fuck yourself up.  And then because they're saying his arm isn't as great as his running and everything else he does or did for the Gators. 
[01:47:00]  McNabb did that.  And also fucking Michael Vick had a good running game.  They both turned into that.  Like Patrice said, they're talking seventh round for this guy.  That did everything that was asked of him in the college, you know, game.  Here's the commercial in case you missed it.  Tim Tebow pro-life commercial.  So, I mean, there was so much outrage and then this was...  Why was there outrage?  Can we see it?  What fucking babies?  The guy's expressing his opinion.  Outrage?  Fuck him.  Oh, it's that abortion issue.  It kind of gets people...  Well, let him tell you what. 
[01:47:30]  It kind of gets people talking.  Kind of like the race issue.  It gets people talking.  You want to do it now?  I call him my miracle baby.  He almost didn't make it into this world.  I can remember so many times when I almost lost him.  It was so hard.  Well, he's all grown up now and I still worry about himself.  You know, with all our family's been through, you have to be tough.  Timmy, we're trying to tell our story here.  Sorry about that, Mom.  You still worry about me, Mom? 
[01:48:00]  Well, yeah.  You're not nearly as tough as I am.  That's it.  Why is Kathy Ladman doing a commercial with Tim Leak?  That was so lame.  That's the ad that everyone was outraged about.  Who was outraged about that?  And by the end, I still didn't really know what it was for.  She was going to get an abortion is what she was saying?  I guess.  What is she?  A single mom?  Tim Tebow doesn't have a father in the picture?  No, Tim Tebow's like Mr. Perfect.  His family, he has a fucking father.  So what is she talking about? 
[01:48:30]  She was thinking of, does anyone know the back story of this damn thing?  Who was outraged, though?  Why would anybody be outraged by that?  Yeah, there was nothing.  He's tackling abortion, Jim.  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  He doesn't want women to fucking have abortions.  Oh, and he's a virgin, too, by the way.  Well, is he really?  Depending on what we're talking about.  There's nowhere to prove it, though, with a guy.  I still have my hymen.  No.  In my left ball.  I think there's something else going on there. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Don't fucking...  I don't know.  I don't know either, but I'm just saying.  Wait, is he really religious?  He's saving him for marriage?  I don't know.  Yeah, he's big time.  He's like a Mormon or something ridiculous.  What a dork.  That's what he is.  That is a dork move.  He's a dork.  He's a dork.  There's people out there that are doing that.  Whatever.  God bless you.  He's probably a little dick.  You're a dork.  Rotten little cock.  He probably hooks to one direction.  I bet they botched his circumcision.  This fucking dick probably looks like a fucking burn victim.  Bobo.  A rotten little cock. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, just a rotten curved cock to the side with a botched piece of skin on the fucking tip.  All right, here we go.  Sean and George have got the backstory of this fucking T-Bone commercial.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  His mom was pregnant with him when she was in the Philippines, and she got sick right  before it was time to give birth, and the doctors told her that there was a high chance  that if she continued with it and gave birth, that it would kill her, and that she needed  to have an abortion to save her life, and she decided to go through with it anyway. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Well, it worked out for her.  Good for her.  There's probably a bunch of women that did abort the child and ended up living.  And then they created this big, should-have-been-aborted monster right here.  They're showing a picture of this fucking specimen.  They got a rock star for their side of the issue, that's for sure.  Yeah.  It's pretty hard to argue this way.  He could have been in a vacuum, and this fucker is a seventh-round monster. 
[01:50:30]  One of the greatest college football players ever.  They just show commercials of him bullying coat hangers.  They got a rock star on their side, man.  How do you compete with that?  Jesus.  I'm looking at this.  Turn this off.  Yeah.  What are you doing, Sam?  Because I'm just looking at the guy going, this fucking guy was an abortion?  Let's see his fucking botched circumcision pick.  I want to see where the fucking head skin is connected to the shaft.  Do you ever see a botched circumcision?  There's long fucking stringy pieces of skin. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, God.  It looks like the cockhead's in jail.  It's fucking terrible.  Yuck.  Well, there's...  That was the outrage, I guess.  I don't know.  And he does circumcisions, like in...  He goes to, like, to Philippines and does circumcisions.  He does?  Tim Jebo?  Yes.  Why?  He's a...  He's one of them dudes, man.  He's a fucking...  He's all in.  A missionary guy.  How about your fucking girl leave baby dicks alone, Timmy?  How about your layoff baby cock? 
[01:51:30]  He's all in with that religion stuff.  Yeah, I know, but why don't you leave little fucking Filipino baby cock alone?  It's none of your concern.  He's helping.  Mind your business.  He's helping, Jimmy, man.  Nobody needs you in your fucking...  Your stupid college game cutting off baby dicks.  Stop circumcising babies.  Leave them alone.  Baby dicks.  I know.  Little kids are all happy.  They want an autograph.  He slices the tip of their cock off.  What a creep.  Go fuck a girl.  He probably wants to make sure their dicks don't come out as awful as his.  Oh, my God. 
[01:52:00]  That's what he's doing.  Well, yeah.  Despise him.  Despise.  Despise.  Oh, God.  So, I don't know.  That was it for the commercials, I think.  What else was there?  I don't know.  Oh, we're going to talk about the Doritos commercials?  No, they had the guy in the coffin, which could have been good, until they had to show you that he was alive.  Oh, thank God he's okay.  When the coffin tipped over and all the Doritos spilled out.  Yeah, and he jumps out.  It would have been so much fun if there was a dead body in the middle of Doritos. 
[01:52:30]  I would have enjoyed that.  Yeah, this is pretty...  Jeff in Buffalo.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Yeah, another reason it was such a controversial commercial is because while they accepted the anti-abortion commercial, CBS rejected a gay dating website commercial.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but CBS allowed a lot of gay commercials yesterday.  There was a lot of fucking weird guys walking around with no pants shit commercials.  Yeah, but basically, they were saying that it kind of concreted CBS's political views, which is not normally done on network television. 
[01:53:00]  But didn't they say that the commercial just wasn't up to their standards or something?  They were trying to make some kind of excuse.  All right, guys.  Can you explain corporate worlds?  I just don't understand.  I swear to God, I've been trying.  Why don't they just say, we don't want sissies on our channel?  Sissies.  Why is it always some lying-ass shit?  Mm-hmm.  Sissies.  Well, they can't say...  We don't want sissies shit.  They can't have a press release where they say, we don't want sissies.  We don't want sissies.  Can you clean that up a little bit for everybody to treat? 
[01:53:30]  We're not allowing sissy marries.  Oh, he's got the commercial.  Sammykins has the commercial.  Yeah, we...  I haven't seen it.  I think we've all seen that.  I've not seen it.  10, 5, let's go!  Oh, whoa!  That's what I'm talking about, baby.  What?  You suck!  Yeah.  That's right.  You suck.  That's accurate.  I want to kiss this guy.  I really, really, really want to kiss this guy. 
[01:54:00]  Go with it, why not?  Hey, why isn't the black guy kissing that?  Yeah, what happened?  Because they have to fight for his...  Why does it have to be the two white guys?  It's called Man Crunch?  They're fighting for his big black cock.  He's the prize.  The two twinks are fighting.  They want to be seated by the black bull.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  That commercial shouldn't have been shown.  Because it was like...  If it was a guy grinding on a chick like that, they wouldn't have allowed it either. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, true.  They wouldn't have allowed it either.  You know what, though?  Everyone knows about that damn website now because that commercial's been shown everywhere.  You suck.  Because it was denied by CBS.  So in the end, they win.  Let's say how to Mike in Florida.  Those two guys were fags for nothing.  But they weren't even kissing.  They were just hugging.  Yeah, they were fake kisses.  It was stupid.  Mikey!  Hey, good morning, boys.  Jimmy, happy birthday, buddy.  Thank you, Mike.  Patrice, just to clarify, Tim Tebow doesn't touch little boy's pee-pies when he goes on his mission. 
[01:55:00]  He does their cleft palates in Third World.  Oh, he does the cleft palates.  What do you mean he does?  I thought he did the dick surgery.  That's major surgery.  How the fuck does he do that?  I don't know.  He was born in the Philippines with his parents, and they've been doing this shit forever.  There was an article.  I think it would be a little bit more publicity if a 19-year-old boy was going down to the Philippines  touching pee-pies.  There is an article that says in 2008 he was doing circumcisions down in the Philippines.  Yeah, I'm not crazy.  Why is he doing fucking cleft palates?  What's he doing? 
[01:55:30]  Get him some wax lips.  To fix their...  That's what they're telling me.  Fuck yeah, boys.  Fixing their dicks in their mouths.  What the fuck is he up to?  Exactly.  Leave that little cleft palates alone.  They're adorable.  Not even a junior.  Let's go to Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  Morning, guys.  So this means that all these women that see the Tebow commercial are going to say,  hey, we can stop having abortions, and we'll get a pro quarterback, and all they end  up with waterheads and fucking burdens.  Jesus.  Well, yeah, that is true.  They don't show the other mothers that made that same decision, and now can't walk through 
[01:56:00]  the mall because the kid makes so much of a racket.  It says he did.  This guy was wrong.  Huh?  This guy was wrong.  There's an article.  He did circumcisions.  Filipino penis surgeries.  What the fuck is that about, man?  Wonderful.  God damn.  Speaking of cleft palates.  Hey, E-Rock.  I didn't see E-Rock all day.  What's going on?  E to the rock.  How you doing?  How's that workout regimen?  Doing good?  Doing good.  Yeah, good afternoon.  It's good.  Okay.  I love the mic. 
[01:56:30]  Everybody's mean on Monday morning.  Did you see the Plaxico Burris interview?  Nope.  You missed all this fun stuff.  I watched it.  I told you what I was doing.  There would have been a lot of stuff to be outraged about, though.  Plaxico.  Bill Cowher, right?  Was his coach?  Let's fucking watch it.  Well, Plaxico, what?  Played for Cowher in Pittsburgh, I guess?  Yes.  So he knows him very well.  So they did this jailhouse interview before the Super Bowl.  And by the end of it, you're like, what the fuck?  This guy did commit this crime, right?  And somebody finally spoke up after the piece saying, whoa, let's not forget some facts here. 
[01:57:00]  Why?  Did it seem like, oh, why is this motherfucker in jail?  Was that it?  Well, we could, I mean, I got some of the interview here.  We could, yeah, let's see how deep we get into this.  The greatest statement I heard about this is his lawyer said he should go to, he didn't, he did something dumb.  You shouldn't go to jail for fucking three years for being dumb.  Yeah.  Yeah, two years, right?  Mandatory.  Mandatory, too.  For being dumb, which is a perfect, he fucked up. 
[01:57:30]  And he's got to do the two.  That really is annoying.  He's only been in there, what, a few months at this point?  Damn, you can't fuck up.  Jail is to rehabilitate you.  Jail is to say, you're a criminal, we got to get you right.  It's not there to go, oh, man, you shot yourself in the fucking leg.  We got to put you in there for two years so you'll never shoot yourself in the fucking leg again.  True.  This is ridiculous, man.  I don't think jail's rehabilitation as much as it is get this person off the fucking streets for as long as we can or something.  There is no rehabilitation going on in there.  But do we need to get him off the streets?  No, no, he seemed like he's a guy that fucked up. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, but the idea of having an illegal firearm like that in New York City.  He's trying, I mean, that's what it is.  And I'll give you this.  It's a young black dude, young black millionaire who does not, and this is the sad thing,  he does not want to seem like a sellout and stop hanging out with black people.  He only should hang out with other black millionaires in a place where only black millionaires can be. 
[01:58:30]  He doesn't have to worry about pistols.  You know what?  Get a fucking holster.  We're going to buy it.  That's what it is.  Get a holster so you're not sticking the fucking gun in your pants, dummy.  If you want to carry a gun, especially illegally, let's get a fucking holster.  Let's get into this, because he talks about rehabilitation and all that shit.  So let's see.  This is from yesterday, obviously.  You know, Plex, when you said goodbye to Tiffany and Elijah, when did it finally hit you that you were actually in prison? 
[01:59:00]  I think when I woke up that morning.  It was a surreal feeling.  And I said to my nice wife, I saw a giant Mexican dick hanging in front of my football face.  When did it hit me?  Yes.  When I was going to grab lunch and two Aryans punched me in the jaw.  A guy with a Hitler tattoo on his knuckle fucking knocked out my molars.  Then I realized I was in prison.  When I had to shake roaches at the bottom of my cereal box.  When my dessert was taken by a man who was much larger than me. 
[01:59:30]  When I realized I had to sharpen my toothbrush to keep this motherfucker from fucking me in the ass.  Could you rewind that question again for Bill?  I think we missed Plexico's answer.  All right, let's see.  Let's see.  I'm actually in prison.  I think when I woke up that morning.  We want to go further.  Fuck.  All right, let's just fucking do this.  You know, Plex, when you said goodbye to Tiffany and Elijah, when did it finally hit you that you were actually in prison? 
[02:00:00]  Well, Bill, I was taking a shower and someone put their dick in my butt.  That's when it hits you.  Wolf hit on me.  Yeah.  When the sisters tried to rape me in the cellar.  I could be a friend to you.  Yeah, so when they did a cell extraction and then maced me.  Wait a minute.  I like that.  Wolf, we have to give Norton credit on what a great, Wolf is a fucking great reference. 
[02:00:30]  Fucking Wolf.  What happened, Plex?  Wolf wanted to get friendly.  I didn't.  You know, Plex, when you said goodbye to Tiffany and Elijah, when did it finally hit you that you were actually in prison?  I think when I woke up that morning.  You know, it was a surreal feeling that, you know, I remember that morning as if it was yesterday. 
[02:01:00]  You know, I don't think for anybody that jail or prison is a part of the plan of life.  You know, you really don't know what to expect.  You know, I remember putting my suit on my son and taking that drive and going into that courtroom.  And, you know, kissing my wife and telling her everything's going to be okay and seeing her emotional crime.  You know, it cuts you deep.  I think there's no way this guy should have to do two years, though. 
[02:01:30]  But it's, of course, because that fucking Bloomberg, who I can't stand, had to shoot his mouth off.  He shouldn't get any preferential treatment.  Meanwhile, this fucking jizzbag mayor spends $100 million to get elected.  Hey, fucking asshole.  How about just taking some of that and throwing it into the economy?  How about taking your own money and just fucking hiring people to do shit?  No.  Can't stomach him.  Is it safe to say that this experience has made you a better husband and father?  Oh, man, no question.  Because, you know, when it's all really said and done, you look around and you see when people are standing up. 
[02:02:00]  And, you know, my wife has just been incredible, you know, through this whole situation.  I mean, you couldn't ask to be with a better person.  I've never heard prison so boring.  Like, I watch Lock Up all the time.  It's fucking unbelievable.  That shit going on all the time.  Here's what they should do.  Have Cowher go in with him.  On an all-day fucking, you know, all right, child time, let's go.  You watch him tripping him and spitting in his foot, picking the nose and rubbing it in his fucking mac and cheese. 
[02:02:30]  And he has to be in PC.  He has to be in Punk City.  And how it's filmed, you can barely tell they're in jail.  It was just in a room.  He has to be in PC, man.  He got to be.  Well, you want to hear about his normal day?  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  There's no cameras outside this room.  Tell me about your normal day.  Well, I just...  Oh, boy.  You, Kyle, he's giving the most, like...  Well, that's what I'm getting at here.  This is unbelievable.  Because then his fellow broadcasters there give it to him a little bit, like, yo, hey, whoa. 
[02:03:00]  Why is the asshole head coach with the fucking Pittsburgh cheesedick mustache doing an interview?  He's not a fucking interviewer.  He was his coach for a while, so he feels like he really knows this guy.  And, you know...  There's no cameras outside this room.  Tell me about your normal day.  You know, I wake up and the first thing I do is I just get on my knees and I pray and I just thank God for another day.  I go from there and, you know, I just try to keep my mind and focus on the right things. 
[02:03:30]  Are you able to work out?  Yeah, I do.  I actually work out about four days a week.  I do as much as I can.  You know, it's not a L.A. fitness or balance or anything like that, but...  Oh, my God.  These guys on Instant Feedback are going with the, when did you realize you were in prison?  Josh writes, when some bald guy bent me over and told me to call him Tom Brady.  And then, dog shit sniffer, I realized I was in jail when I woke up spooning a 350-pound man called Sunshine. 
[02:04:00]  And when I had to put a couple of cans of soda in a pillowcase to ward off my cellmate.  That's funny.  Yes, I realized I was in jail when the radio blew up in Viking's ear.  Viking!  Yes.  When Viking drew a bird and we all laughed at him.  Fucking Tweety, man.  Yeah.  It was Tweety.  When Warren Jerome got shot with the gun I had, I realized I was in jail.  I realized there wasn't enough soda cans to beat off my rapers. 
[02:04:30]  When I put it in a, when I put it in a pillowcase, it was just two Dr. Peppers and that didn't hurt him.  Oh, shit.  He goes on to explain athletes and guns.  Oh, God.  Plex, we're seeing it a lot these days.  Athletes and guns.  Why is it so prominent?  I can speak from a personal, you know, standpoint.  You know, I had my home broken into twice. 
[02:05:00]  You know, when things like that happen, you know, it kind of takes your, you know, peace of mind away.  You hear about guys getting robbed at gunpoint.  You know, it scares you a little bit.  You know, you say to yourself, you know, you don't want to be in that situation.  And then when I look at my situation, you know, you can make a bad situation even worse.  In a position of prominence that you were in and a lot of athletes were in, the choices have to be a little bit different as well.  Don't they?  That's one of the things that, you know, guys for myself, you know, you go into a lapse of judgment for a quick second. 
[02:05:30]  Because, you know, you're thinking about yourself.  My decision, you know, it was a self-decision.  Well, go through the legal channels and fucking catch yourself up.  I can't get a gun, motherfucker, throw my truck from front of my damn house.  That shit still scares me.  A year ago, I'm not over that.  That shit's violating, man.  That is, huh?  Yep.  That'd make me carry a fucking illegal gun and shoot myself in the leg because I'm scared.  Shoot yourself in the fucking leg, yeah.  Because that shit scared the fuck out of you, right?  Motherfuckers know where you're living.  It's hard to get a goddamn gun in this. 
[02:06:00]  That shit's scary.  And motherfucking niggas don't fuck with white people.  They're not going to go in your house.  They're too scared.  They're going to come in my fucking house.  No, my neighborhood is ripe.  Believe me, it's ripe.  I still haven't seen one thing where they just walk in those houses.  It doesn't seem right.  They'll kick that fucking door in or they'll knock and say, oh, there's some kind of issue  and these idiots open the door or these idiots leave one door unlocked or a window and then 
[02:06:30]  before you know it, you're fucking opening your eyes and there's some fucking guy there  with a gun or a knife to your fucking throat.  That shit's scary, man.  Oh, how violating would that feel?  And you carry a gun, you just are able to, I mean, he might have a fucking, a felony  and you can't get one, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, that's true.  I don't know what his record is.  And he wanted a gun now.  But you got to be a resident of New York in order to even get a New York license.  You see, oh shit, you got it, you got it.  It's like, fuck that, man.  I'm taking my gun.  You see, uh.  That's why there's so many illegal guns.  I think gun control puts more illegal guns on the fucking street. 
[02:07:00]  There's no way you can figure out how to keep the bad guys from getting guns.  And I was just reading about fucking the Constitution, right?  Yeah.  Right to bear arms.  And that's what I'm saying about, you know, going back to all the racial shit where they  got me thinking the NRA is a bunch of just crazy crackers who want guns.  It was the Second Amendment.  It's the second most important thing.  Number two, yes.  On the Constitution.  Talking is number one.  Open in your fucking mouth is number one.  Number two is pistols. 
[02:07:30]  Is fucking guns.  And the reason that you have that is number two.  Is to protect number one.  No.  It's in case a traitor ever gains control in a country.  You have an armed populace.  Yeah, yeah, we know all that.  That's the reason.  It's fucking, like you go, we supposed to have guns.  It's like all of a sudden something twisted.  All of a sudden your democracy turns into a dictatorship.  Now the dictatorship has the army because he's in charge now. 
[02:08:00]  So then you get the armed populace who can fight against it.  Of course.  That was the basic reasoning.  It's the second most important thing.  It's number two.  Right.  Slavery was 16.  As well it should be.  You're saying it should be on it?  All right, listen.  So.  Let's fast forward.  I mean, they ask him, did you let everyone down?  Of course he said yes.  And a return to the NFL. 
[02:08:30]  Of course he said yes.  This is a real heart to heart though.  He's like, of course.  I want to fast forward.  So the interview ends and it was a feel good interview with this Plaxico guy.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  And you have Boomer and James Brown and Marino and Shannon Sharp.  Somebody finally spoke up at the end of the interview going, well, you're missing out on something here, Bill.  I bet it was Boomer.  Who?  I was going to say.  Who do you think it was?  I don't remember.  I bet it was Shannon Sharp.  No.  No, it wasn't Shannon Sharp.  Hell fucking no.  I'm going to go with.  I had a fucking cornball Boomer.  It was either Boomer or. 
[02:09:00]  No, I think it was Boomer.  And you know, guys, whether he comes back in play or not, that's a sidebar.  The message out there is there's a lesson to be learned by what went through with Plaxico.  And you don't want to have to learn it the hard way that he's experiencing now.  And hopefully people will see that and they'll learn from that.  You know, Coach, you did a great job and I'm sure it was very hard for you.  I actually have very mixed emotions about this because I've watched Plaxico since he's been in New York.  And this isn't the only time that he has caused problems.  And I will say this.  This should be a PSA for all athletes out there. 
[02:09:30]  Not to have an unlicensed handgun with them in our cities.  You're right.  And, you know, Coach, it was a sad, sad interview because just two years ago, as you mentioned in the piece, he was catching the game winning touchdown.  It's sad that he had to lose his career, go to jail for a couple of years in order to learn a lesson.  That is a painful way to learn a lesson.  And, Shannon, you know what?  He is going to learn his lesson.  And the one thing for sure is he said he wants to come back and play.  And, you know, he's a guy that's 32 years old.  And you know in the NFL there's a lot of guys, a lot of teams that need a player like Plaxico Purse. 
[02:10:00]  I think his sincerity was absolutely clear, remorseful, very sincere in that piece, Coach, without a doubt.  I've never heard more worthless commentary after an interview.  Drivel.  Four dumbbells trying to be socially relevant.  You just don't have an unlicensed gun in our cities.  You know the way I see it, shut up.  What down is it?  You fucking idiot jock.  You know the way I see it.  Stop trying to be poignant, fucking morons.  All right, let's do some leaks.  We've got to go to the bathroom. 
[02:10:30]  Show me more Steve Linwood.  No, thank you.  He was good.  We're going to play this as we go to break.  Stay there.  Patrice O'Neal.  Busy show.  We've got Jason Ellis outside the studio.  We're going to get to him in a few minutes.  Chris Mad Dog Russo is going to be on the show within seconds.  Patrice O'Neal helping us out today.  And this is worth playing for a goof.  This weather guy lost his fucking mind.  I think a lot of people have heard this by now as they're doing their own searching around the Internet.  What, you get 38 inches down in the Washington, D.C. area. 
[02:11:00]  And one of the local guys out of Baltimore lost his fucking mind.  Yes, Sam?  He's not actually a local guy.  Like, this guy works for AccuWeather.  Oh, so this goes everywhere.  It goes everywhere.  But he does these video forecasts for different cities.  Right.  And each time he does the video forecast, he pretends he's from that city.  Oh, okay.  But apparently, like, this guy's on 1010 Winds and WABC, and he's on radio in Buffalo.  What a phony.  He's got a nice gig, huh?  He just goes city to city pretending. 
[02:11:30]  Like, the videos are gone now, but before the Super Bowl, he did a report for Boston and Buffalo.  And both reports, he said, it's Super Bowl weekend.  I know.  Our Patriots aren't in.  And then for Buffalo, he went, I know.  Our guys aren't in.  The Bills aren't in.  But, you know.  Oh, really?  So, yeah.  He just pretends he's...  But they got rid of that audio?  Yeah, I don't know where the videos are anymore.  You know, but...  What a fraud this guy is.  You know what?  I would watch the weather on TV if it was done like this every fucking day.  Yeah, he's a psychopath. 
[02:12:00]  Where's Patrice going?  Bathroom.  It's a fuck.  Take a piss.  Why are you bringing a head?  You were just lecturing me about my piss fucking schedule.  I'm not healthy.  Oh.  This guy's a jack-of-all-trades master and nuns.  All right, here we go.  Did you see this yet, Ant?  No.  This weather guy loses his mind?  Nope.  I have not seen it either.  Oh, boy.  14 to 22 inches of snow. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, boy.  Well, I'm Akiweather.com meteorologist Jim Kosick.  Our paralyzing, crippling, wrecked and breaking storm comes today.  What's wrong with him?  Road closures, flight cancellations in the hundreds, power outages by the tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands. 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  And problem number one to start it all today, 35 degrees.  So when the snow comes in, kicks temperatures down, sub-freezing, so it initially melted, turns to black ice.  That's only one problem.  Problem number two, 14 to 22 inches of snow.  Winding down Saturday afternoon.  Tertiary problem.  Yeah, I've been reading the dictionary.  Blowing and drifting.  Oh, three, four, five feet drifts. 
[02:13:30]  So you shovel.  Drift back over.  Shovel.  Drift.  Shovel.  Why would we listen to the audio when he screams?  Could I get a one-way?  The audio cuts out because he doesn't, because like, he's just on one of those mics that instead of it over-modulating, it cuts the audio.  It'll just gate it right out.  What you missed right there was him leaning back screaming bloody murder, but the audio cuts out, unfortunately.  Exactly.  Another guy whose fucking duty is to do the weather wants to be entertaining.  Tell me how much fucking weather.  Cunt.  Drift back over. 
[02:14:00]  Shovel.  Drift.  Shovel.  Ah.  Ah, there's the scream.  Ah.  Okay.  Could I get a one-way ticket to New Orleans?  Sun comes back Sunday.  Monday.  Listen, I love crab cakes, but we could replace it with jambalaya.  It's not for both.  More snow showers later Tuesday.  I love crab cakes.  I'm going to go to Cosek.  Asshole.  There you go.  What's wrong with him?  I hate him.  He does these internet forecasts, and he obviously has just been banking on one becoming that  YouTube phenomenon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he got one. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Because everyone's talking about it today.  Hey, let's say hi to Mad Dog.  Oh.  Mad Dog.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi, Chris.  There he is.  Why are you so chipper always?  Well, you know what?  I tell you, I like the Colts all week, but I had told you late last week that there was  a lot of people who liked the Saints.  I did not want to root for Bill Polian, the general manager.  I don't like him at all for what he did at the end of the regular season with that freaking  14-0 stuff.  I get sick of hearing about Manning, the greatest quarterback of all time, which was not true. 
[02:15:00]  So I went Saints yesterday in the betting department, and that makes me a happy man today.  So there you go.  Plus, I took two prop plays.  You know, that's like little proposition themes.  Yeah.  One was over breeze, touchdown passes, one and a half.  I thought that was a good play.  He had two.  And the other one was over breeze, 24 and a half completions.  I thought that was a good play.  He had, what do you have, 33, 34, something like that, and the game set a record. 
[02:15:30]  So I had those two, plus the Saints, plus Manning was bad in the last five minutes.  Yep.  I got an easy show today.  I'm going away in two weeks, and I'm talking to you guys now.  That's not a bad week.  Hey, Chris, what did you think?  I thought it was a really bad play when they were going in the fourth quarter, when Manning,  when they ran it on third down, with like a minute left and no timeouts.  What a stupid waste of time that was.  Absolutely.  The game was over at that point.  Manning was shot after the interception. 
[02:16:00]  That whole last drive was a bad drive.  They had about 3.14 to go, three timeouts.  They didn't know how they wanted to handle it.  They didn't spike the ball properly.  They didn't use their timeouts.  You just bring up that play.  That last three minutes was very bad.  Plus, I thought the last drive at the end of the first half, when they stopped them at  the one-yard line, they had to get a first down there, and they, you know, throw the ball.  They're a flowing team, and Manning ran the ball three straight times. 
[02:16:30]  Saints called the timeout, got the ball back, and kicked the field goal to make it 10-6.  Huge that the Saints got three points there at the end of the half.  So, not a good performance by the Colts.  They played very poorly in the game.  The Saints outplayed him.  The quarterback outplayed Manning, too.  Yeah, there you go.  It gave him a lot of momentum going into the second half, too.  Absolutely.  Plus the onside kick.  Chris, this is Mad Dog Russo.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Very funny comic.  I don't know, Mr. Russo.  I don't know what to call him.  Hello, guys.  How are you?  Can I ask you a question? 
[02:17:00]  As a football fan myself, I'm watching Peyton, and before, he's one of those guys like Dan  Marino, I thought that he's in the argument for best quarterback of all time, even without  winning a Super Bowl.  And I thought one was enough.  And I thought if he lost this one, he wouldn't need another one to beat.  But I think that interception messed his pedigree up so much that he has to now win another  Super Bowl because it was so bad.  It was so non-Payton-like. 
[02:17:30]  To be considered the greatest quarterback of all time.  First off, I never considered...  Listen, a lot of people jumped on his bandwagon because he had a wonderful year and he was  great against the Jets.  I never considered him the greatest quarterback of all time.  Phil Simms talked about that all last week.  He said he was on his way.  Host talked about that.  Montana won four Super Bowls.  Yes.  Bradshaw, four Super Bowls.  Brady has won three Super Bowls.  Now, Tom Brady, if Tom Brady didn't win those three, I don't know if this is... 
[02:18:00]  He wouldn't be in the discussion without those three.  He's not in the discussion.  Some people have thrown him in that discussion.  This Peyton Manning's got to win at least three.  Marino's in the discussion.  Hasn't won the Super Bowl.  He's not in the discussion with...  You know, Marino is not in the discussion with Unitas, Montana, Brady.  He's not in that discussion.  I don't know about that.  He's in the discussion, he's an all-time great, but he's not on that level.  Oh, we are talking about the three or four great... 
[02:18:30]  You know, Otto Graham's another one.  There are about three or four great quarterbacks, all-timers, who are on top of their class.  Otto Graham?  That is Unitas, Montana, Brady.  Otto Graham will play for the Browns in the 50s.  But that's...  Those are the four, not Marino.  Who the hell is Otto Graham?  Were black guys allowed to play back then?  He was the white...  He won seven titles, Otto Graham.  Otto, listen, the old-timers get mad if you don't put Graham in there.  You want to throw Graham out because you're not...  Slinging Sammy Barr, too? 
[02:19:00]  Like, it's like...  See, Mad Dog understands that sports radio stuff.  You've got to put an old guy in there for the old...  But I'm saying...  If you don't want to, you don't have to.  But Unitas, Montana, Brady are by themselves.  Manning was put in that level before this game.  He's not in that level.  Well, hold on, Chris.  You're saying people don't put Marino in there?  Oh, God, no.  But if you're putting Brady in there for three, how do you not put Aikman in there for three?  Because Aikman was on a different kind of team.  He had Emmitt.  He had Michael Irvin. 
[02:19:30]  Brady didn't have...  You know, don't forget, Morse doesn't want a Super Bowl.  But isn't there a way, Chris, aren't you in a way, by making that Aikman argument,  aren't you making an argument for Marino?  Because he didn't have a running game.  I mean, he had great receivers, but he did not have a running game.  So everybody knew it was pass, pass.  Bottom line is, you cannot put Marino as the top two three quarterbacks in the history  of the NFL when he did not want a Super Bowl.  Yeah, maybe if he won one, it would be a different story.  This seems like his...  I mean, Brady's the MVP.  I mean, Brady's the Super Bowl MVP.  He's three-time Super Bowl MVP. 
[02:20:00]  I mean, you cannot put Marino...  Now, listen, I'm a Marino lover, but he does not belong in that class.  I love Marino.  It wasn't all his fault.  I think Marino's with Elway, and Elway won too.  I think Elway, the first one, had Terrell Davis.  But you cannot put...  But the issue right now is Manning, and Manning yesterday was outplayed by his counterpart.  And when you look at Montana and Unitas in these kind of games, they are not outplayed  by the other guy.  And Breeze outplayed Manning yesterday.  Manning had 17 points against a lousy defense. 
[02:20:30]  Manning had a very bad drive at the end of the first half, and he ran the ball three times.  He threw the terrible interception.  And in the last three minutes, you alluded to it, he was rattled.  He didn't know what he was doing.  He had to score quick and everything else.  He had his timeouts.  They did a bad job there.  Because he threw an uncharacteristically bad pass for him.  I think that shocked him.  The pass was not bad.  You said it earlier.  Well, the play was great.  I mean, that just shocked him.  He just doesn't do that. 
[02:21:00]  Manning, though, go look at Manning's history in big games.  Manning has never been as good in the postseason as he has been in the regular season.  He wasn't even that good against the Bears three years ago.  They gave him the MVP.  He threw two interceptions in that game.  They gave him the MVP.  They had nobody else to give it to.  Now, do you put Favre in there with one Super Bowl?  I'm sorry?  Do you put Favre in that conversation with one Super Bowl?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not. 
[02:21:30]  How about that?  Again, that level, and I'm not a football historian.  You don't have to ask me.  But he asked him for the sports talk opinion.  The level that we are referring to is the immortal level.  The immortal level is Unitas, who's the greatest quarterback.  First big quarterback, quarter zone plays, won three titles.  Back-to-back, 58 championship game, Giants, the whole bit.  Bart Stott.  Unitas, Montana, and I put Brady there.  Other people even wouldn't do that.  Oh, you're missing one. 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  Richard Todd.  You don't forget Danny White, too, because he would also punch.  And Danny White.  Danny White, yeah.  Roger Staubach's in there.  He only got two.  Well, Staubach's a great player.  He's not an immortal.  Just short.  And, you know, a lot of people don't give Bradshaw enough credit.  You know, Bradshaw won four Super Bowls.  The problem that Bradshaw has, he played with nine Hall of Famers.  So people kind of think he's a little, you know, they think about Mean Joe Green and  Lynn Swann.  His team was stacked.  They don't think about Bradshaw, and he won four.  He was 4-0 in that game. 
[02:22:30]  4-0.  And let's face it.  You, we watched.  Manning was not good yesterday.  He was not great in the game.  He looked a little shaky.  They scored 17 points against a very average defense.  And that defense got killed by the Vikings.  And they scored 17 points.  You know, listen, but give the Saints credit.  I mean, how about the onside kickstarter secondhand?  That was ballsy.  I love that.  I was the only one who called that.  Oh, what a tremendous job.  I mean, Sean Payton. 
[02:23:00]  And you know what?  It's funny.  I thought, listen, I had it close, so keep that in mind.  But on Friday, I went through the lineups.  The Saints have fibers.  They got Dewey Henderson and Colston and Shockey and Lance Moore and Reggie Bush.  And they got a lot of offensive guys.  The Colts really have Reggie Wayne, a couple of rookie receivers.  I mean, it's almost like the Saints have a better offense than the Colts do. 
[02:23:30]  But we all thought the Colts were so good because of the quarterback.  And in this case, Breeze played better.  Breeze played better yesterday than Manning did.  I thought the Saints made a dumb move when they went for it on fourth down, even though  they wound up giving good field position and getting the ball back.  That was a dumb move.  That was a great move, in my opinion.  Really?  And I want to tell you why.  If you set up with a field goal there and kick off, the Colts will start their drive at  the 30-yard line, two minutes to go, three timeouts. 
[02:24:00]  And they're going to come back and they're going to score a field goal.  Instead, if you don't get it, the Colts will start their drive.  First off, you take 30 seconds off the clock because it runs.  And the Colts start their drive at the one-yard line.  And they're not going to think about scoring.  They're going to be thinking about getting a first down to run out the clock.  So if you go for it and don't get it, the worst, it's 10-3.  If you kick the field goal, they're going to probably come down and score, gain momentum 
[02:24:30]  from the field goal that they just got.  And as it turned out, you use your timeouts properly.  They did not get a first down.  And you kick the field goal anyway to make it 10-6.  But the way the defense worked there, why wouldn't the defense work if you kicked the  field goal and then kicked it off?  I mean, in hindsight, it paid off.  Because there's a big difference in mindset when you start your drive at the one-yard line  compared to starting a drive at the 30-yard line.  But your defense has got to be able to stop a team in the last two minutes if you score. 
[02:25:00]  You can't give up a potential score.  But it's only 10-3.  And your offense is not scoring.  And you can go in 10-6.  Well, they're in 10-6 anyway.  No, but I mean, it did happen to work out that way.  But I mean, when the play was done.  That's what it counts.  I mean, the bottom line is, you want them to kick the field goal at 10-3.  Well, it went in 10-6.  That's what the score was.  But at the moment, it was still...  I thought Sims got that completely wrong.  I mentioned that today in the air.  I think because of the fact it's the Colts. 
[02:25:30]  Put them...  If you don't score, put them at the one-yard line.  And then you know the worst it's going to be is 10-3.  And if you get lucky with all three of your timeouts,  maybe you make them punt it from their own end zone,  and you can get a cheap field goal.  And that's exactly what occurred.  But Payton Manning is the best quarterback you've ever seen, though, right?  No, he's not.  He's not better than Montana.  Who's your favorite, personally?  I'm not better than Montana.  Montana's your favorite. 
[02:26:00]  Like, forget the Super Bowls, but just in terms of like,  hey, man, this dude is amazing to me.  My favorite, a guy that I love to watch play, probably Marino.  I love Marino.  I just don't think we would be talking about Tom Brady wouldn't be in anyone's discussion  if he didn't win Super Bowls.  I think...  He's got a lot of Super Bowls under his belt, though.  But I think Montana would be in the conversation if he didn't win.  Yeah, but see, this is professional sports.  It's about winning. 
[02:26:30]  It's not about winning.  In the end, you've got to win at least one.  You've got to win the championship.  You've got to at least win one, and then maybe you can squeeze by as one win.  And winning Super Bowls means you've won playoff games and the NFC championship.  Yeah, you have to win one.  Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.  I think you've got to at least win...  I mean, if Michael Jordan lost six finals, would you call him the greatest?  Nah.  But Bill Russell won 11, and they don't call him the greatest.  I would.  I would.  Yeah, Bill Russell was amazing.  You know, Bill Russell never lost a game seven.  Hey, Mad Dog, what do you think of the coverage in general?  What do you think of the Who?  What do you think of the commercials?  Give us an overall view here. 
[02:27:00]  Listen, the Who looked old, but I love the Who, so I have no problem with them.  Yep.  They looked old, but I have no problem with them.  Daltry looked older than Townsend.  Oh, my God, Roger, with the curly hair and the glasses.  It was a bad guy job, and he couldn't move around at all.  Pete looked like he could still move a little bit.  I enjoyed him, man.  But I like the Who, so I have no problem with that.  I love the Who.  I thought CBS had a terrible game, and I got a good relationship with CBS.  I had McManus on, Sims on, all those guys on last week. 
[02:27:30]  I thought James Brown was atrocious.  He didn't capture the moment.  I thought the pregame...  He doesn't talk much anyway, though, James Brown.  Hold on, I'm not a James Brown fan.  I've never had been.  I mean, Cower with Plaxico Burst.  That was rough.  That's my father and son.  I didn't want to see that.  That did stink, didn't it?  We just went over that audio.  Let's show the Plaxico.  Let's see the room where you had your daughter.  I mean, he's in jail, for God's sake.  I don't mind him, didn't that? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  And I thought Nance...  I thought Nance had a bad game.  First off, on the podium after the game,  he didn't ask Peyton, Sean Peyton, about the onside kick.  That's number one.  Number two, that was a huge upset.  People do...  He did not convey that.  Saints are underdogs.  This is a franchise that's been a laughing stock since 1967, 43 years.  They had won four playoff games in the last 43 years.  They've only had eight winning seasons.  The Saints were a joke in the NFL. 
[02:28:30]  But so was it the Patriots before...  Patriots was nonsense before they won.  So New Orleans hasn't...  They haven't been bad like New Orleans bad for years.  They've never been to a Super Bowl.  I know, but they haven't been like the bag over the head guys for years.  What do you know about the Saints until recently?  Nothing.  Tom Dempsey and his dumb field goal, that's about all they had.  The Saints in 43 years won four playoff games.  What did the Patriots win before Brady?  I'm not talking about the Patriots.  Who cares about the Patriots? 
[02:29:00]  But I'm saying that New Orleans...  But you're saying you brought in how big of an upset it was historically.  Like you brought in how bad they were for the whole franchise.  But I'm saying they were great this year.  But the Saints, there's only four teams in a history, there's five teams before this year  that have not been to a Super Bowl.  The Saints are one of them.  Who are the other ones?  The Browns, the Lions, the Texans, the Jaguars, two expansion teams, and the Saints. 
[02:29:30]  So before this year, there are only five teams in this league who have not been to a Super Bowl.  Two of them are the Browns and the Lions, and two of them are expansion.  Wow.  The Saints have been a bad franchise for a long time.  Okay, last couple years are better.  They're making progress.  Sims did not express that enough.  Plus, you've got Katrina.  I'm Sims.  Nance.  Plus, you've got Katrina.  All the issues there.  And Jim handled this at the end of the game like it was a regular season finale.  That's true. 
[02:30:00]  You know why?  I thought CBS had a bad game.  You know why?  Because...  That's going to get me in trouble by saying that, because now they won't talk to me for a month.  No, they probably should.  But they thought they had a bad game.  They probably should get a new guy in there.  Like, Jim Nance has seen it all.  Why is he going to get excited at this point?  I'm not saying they need a new player.  And I thought Sims.  You know, Sims, who I love.  Sims, I thought he got...  Now, you guys disagree with me, but I thought he did a bad job at the end of the half.  But, you know, he's saying they should take the three points.  Oh, I didn't think he did a bad job.  I don't care.  I didn't even hear what Sims said, because I was in a lot of people. 
[02:30:30]  I just personally thought it was a bad call.  Yeah, well, Sims felt the same way, and I disagree with that.  So we regard...  Maybe Sims is not so wrong.  I guess it's a matter of opinion.  But even Sims said, you know, he didn't...  He was not critical enough of the last Saints drive.  He got it confused about whether they should try an onside kick.  I don't know.  I thought...  To me, I thought Sean Payton did a superb job.  Number one, he used his timeouts properly at the end of the half to get the ball back to kick the field goal.  He kicked the onside kick. 
[02:31:00]  And let's not also forget, that was a great challenge on that two-point conversion.  Hell yeah.  I mean, that was a challenge.  That was not reviewed from the booth.  That was a challenge.  That was a very close call.  He threw the challenge out and got the two points.  Give him credit for that.  It's amazing how these guys hold on to that ball.  But, Chris, you do know that inside of two minutes...  That was inside two minutes, though.  No, no, no.  But I mean the first...  When they went for it on fourth and didn't get it.  Inside the red zone, under two minutes, when the points are not scored, 69% of the time, 
[02:31:30]  the other team goes the other way and scores.  Not from the one-yard line, you know.  You're not going to trip him up.  Jimmy was trying to trip you up.  I just completely made that up.  He just made that up.  69%.  69% is where I screwed up.  I should have said 80%.  That's much more convincing.  But you know what?  I loved the game.  I thought it was a great game.  It was a great football game.  I really loved...  I think America...  I think the NFL gave America a good night.  I like the Who.  The commercials are overrated.  If I see another Doritos commercial, I'm going to vomit. 
[02:32:00]  Well, the commercials have been overrated for a bunch of years now.  You know the commercial stuff.  That's your enterprise.  You guys know that much better than I do.  Nah, we've barely touched on it.  We talked about the Letterman fucking Leno thing, because that kind of came out of nowhere.  No, it was Letterman and Letterman.  They were in the same room for that commercial?  Yeah, it came out.  An article came out explaining the whole damn thing.  Leno flew in, and while Letterman was taping, Jay had a hoodie on and a fake mustache, and  they walked him into the theater thinking no one's going to think twice about this, just 
[02:32:30]  some guy going into the building.  And then they hit him, and then after the Letterman taping, Oprah came separately, too,  and they filmed it.  It took 20 minutes.  Did they get along the two of them?  They said there was pleasantries, and it was very professional, and that was it.  I mean, as soon as the filming was over, they went their own ways.  I mean, they weren't, like, hanging out, getting dinner or anything.  I give, so basically, Leno surprised Dave.  No, it was Dave's idea, actually, the commercial.  The whole thing was Letterman's idea.  I give him credit.  And they said Leno signed on, and there was no money for it, but it was just a good image 
[02:33:00]  for it.  Yeah.  I give him credit.  I mean, that's the commercial of the whole thing.  I think so.  Because, look, you guys, you know more about it than I do.  That's everybody's going to talk about it.  Yeah, that was it.  That's a tremendous job.  I give the both of them credit.  Good for them.  And we said earlier the fact that you could get something like that done in this day and  age.  Without anybody knowing about it.  I know.  That's what's amazing.  Everyone kept their mouths shut for once.  Wow.  Boy, you guys, I tell you right now, the last two times I've been around with you guys,  you've been sharper as a tack. 
[02:33:30]  Well, we're for it.  How about that?  Even Anthony's got a little life.  Sharper.  Well, very little.  I was a little tired.  He played poker all night.  I had a Super Bowl party last night and played some poker.  You know, I don't like going to the Super Bowl parties because, you know me, I've got  to be at the edge of my seat staring at that TV.  Yeah.  And I came home Saturday afternoon.  I worked Saturday morning.  I came home Saturday afternoon.  Staying for that game is tricky.  No highlights.  Getting in and out of that stadium is a pain in the neck.  And I'm flying today to have to work. 
[02:34:00]  So, last night, I stayed for some state and not state for others.  I'd most rather watch it on television.  It gives you more to talk about the next day in the air.  I think you're right.  I think it, I guess it'd be cool.  I would love to see one Super Bowl live before.  You've got to go to one.  Yeah, I haven't, unfortunately.  And I've tried over the years.  But, yeah, it's a much better game to watch at home.  Go to Dallas next year.  Well, dude, I'm listening.  I'm going to start working that angle immediately.  You guys would be great.  Norton wants to go to Dallas for the Super Bowl. 
[02:34:30]  It would be great down there.  Great.  I'd like to go to Dallas.  I've never been to a game in Texas Stadium, even though it's a new one.  That's another thing.  You've got a hundred, I mean, you have to have a spaceship going to a game in.  Yeah, Mad Dog, one of our guys was down there, said hookers all over the joint.  That's news to me.  I'm not trying to say.  I'm just saying it was, like, ridiculous down there.  I know you're a family guy and all that, but I'm just saying, did you see any of these?  I didn't notice it, geez. 
[02:35:00]  Did we just fuck him up?  I have not been a Paulian fan.  He's a general manager of the Colts.  Yeah.  I was very down on the Colts for how they handled the end of the season.  Paulian is a guy that, you know, thinks he's invented football.  Paulian has also blew off all the media last week.  Didn't want to get into it.  I think Jim Caldwell, the coach, was classy as all can be, but I am not a Paulian fan,  so I am glad that Coach lost because of him.  There you go.  And Chris's show, it's Mad Dog Radio.  It's on Sirius Channel 123, XM 144, and it's every weekday, 2 to 7 o'clock. 
[02:35:30]  Definitely.  That's the best, and don't forget all of the other shows.  You know, thanks.  I will get you.  First off, I've got to return a favor.  That's number one.  And secondly, you guys have been good to me the last, really, since I've been there.  I want to make sure you guys know that.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to play golf, right?  Yes, we're going to go play golf at Shorehaven in East Norwalk, Connecticut.  But I mean it.  All of you, Anthony, you guys have a nice job.  I really appreciate it.  Do you know all we want back from you, Chris?  We don't want anything back.  But Jim Norton has a photo with Reggie Jackson that he wants signed. 
[02:36:00]  That's all we want back from you.  You want a photo?  I can do that.  I already got a photo with Reggie.  He's got the photo.  I just want Reggie to sign it.  It's just me and him.  I can do that for you.  Thank you.  Wow.  I'll work on that.  Reggie will do that.  I was just kind of kidding.  Thank you.  I love you.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, Mad Dog.  Everyone's going to check it out.  Today's a great day to check out Mad Dog Radio.  Sirius 123 XM 144.  Two to seven today with Mad Dog.  Check it out and get into it with him.  He loves freaking arguing sports.  Yeah, you shot down that Peyton Manning greatest of all time. 
[02:36:30]  He's out.  He's out.  You shot down that argument very well.  He's out.  It's like talking physics with Einstein.  I just sit here and go, I am a retard when it comes to sports, talking to that guy.  But Russo's a reasonable guy with everything.  He's passionate.  But the quarterback thing was easy to get into.  But it's like if you give time to just go, okay, let me relax for a second.  Yeah.  It's based on opinion because you go, he based it.  And I'm not trying to make him a hypocrite.  I'm just saying he based some of it on the fact that you win a lot of Super Bowls. 
[02:37:00]  Right.  Then for some of them, he'll go, oh, it doesn't count because he had this guy and that guy.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't do that.  You can't go, oh, he's better.  So basically what he did was formulate a great way of just having his own opinion.  Which is, John Elway is not in the same conversation with Tom Brady as an immortal.  But it's based on just winning.  But it's like, oh, wait a minute.  This guy who won had a great team. 
[02:37:30]  Like, Troy Aikman had a great team.  Tom Brady didn't.  That's why Tom Brady's an immortal because it's all opinion.  It's not.  I understand.  There's a lot of opinion involved.  But I think it's, I think you've got to at least win the Super Bowl before you're even in the discussion.  That's not what I'm saying.  But hold on.  And then it comes down to, okay, how many Super Bowls did he win and how many star players this guy, to help him out.  I can see it in a way.  Exactly.  I can totally see it.  But why is Troy Aikman, he was penalized because he had Emmitt Smith. 
[02:38:00]  He's not saying he's penalized.  He's still on the short list, the greatest quarterback of all time.  But he's not Montana, though.  I love that he played, but he's not Montana.  He is.  Nobody's Montana, really.  Troy Aikman had some monsters playing alongside him.  Yeah.  Monsters.  So has him fucking Montana.  Terry Bradshaw.  Monsters.  He had the greatest safety of all time.  The greatest, maybe the greatest tight end of all time.  One of the greatest, the greatest receiver of all time.  So you should argue that with Mad Dog using his own formula. 
[02:38:30]  That would have messed him up a little bit.  That would have messed him up a little bit.  A little slower.  He might not have had an answer for that.  But he was only saying that Bradshaw, he didn't give him Montana.  He was putting those guys close together.  Yeah.  Like he was taking the top echelon.  Yeah, I don't give it to him because of this.  He was kind of balanced.  He wasn't going way off book, like being hypocritical, saying Marino should get it and Montana should.  It was pretty close.  I wasn't trying to make it a hypocrite.  I'm just saying.  I kind of like the argument, though.  It's kind of.  I'm just saying where he's going, where Anthony's like, oh.  It's like, good arguers, people argue well, man. 
[02:39:00]  And are able to pull out some shit and make you go.  He knows every player.  He knows every stat.  He knows the years.  Like, I don't know when they won a Super Bowl back in 1960.  There's people who can speak the languages from Avatar already.  You name a year.  You name a year.  He'll tell you who was in the Super Bowl, which most of us won't be able to do.  I'll tell you who was in the Super Bowl.  1971.  The Dolphins and the Jets.  That's not true.  I don't know.  I just don't know. 
[02:39:30]  You're both AFC.  He'll tell you the final score and the key plays for every single Super Bowl.  He's a prodigy.  I'm not arguing.  It's amazing.  He's a mad dog.  He's amazing.  I'm just saying.  The argument thing is, that's what they do with sports radio.  He'll argue that quarterback thing for five hours.  I think Peyton Manning is the best quarterback I've ever seen.  He's not.  Point at Megan Fox and Russo will go, who's that?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I didn't mean to fuck him up with the prostitute thing.  I was just, you know.  Boy, did he bumble through that.  He was just.  That's what I'm saying.  He was down there for a week. 
[02:40:00]  This guy, he'll curse you out, but he'll just pretend hookers don't exist.  He should just fucking ask you a lot of them out there.  I'm just trying to expand his horizon a little bit.  Look around, Russo.  There's fucking gas all over the place down there.  He's not saying that's what you do, but at least notice it.  Those guys lose their job for even going stepping foot in that world.  Captain Queeg was better on the stand than Russo was with that question.  You go, so in 1940, so you think that Slinger, Sammy Barger, hey, shut the fuck up.  Let me tell you something.  There was a lot of hookers out there.  We are. 
[02:40:30]  Dad, there was a key.  Strawberries.  I knew.  They called me old Yellowstain.  How many portions did you have?  How many portions?  Portions.  Just shows that we like them because we let them go.  We let them go.  We let them on the hook.  Yeah, we like Russo.  Check him out.  All right.  Hey, we got Jason Ellis outside the studio.  Quick break, and he'll be joining the program next.  How does him and Mike have a show together?  Like, damn.  I don't know.  How did they like?  I don't know.  Chris was interesting, and they're like, we'd like something that's not, and they hired Mike. 
[02:41:00]  I thought it was Mike and the man.  I thought it was Mike.  Maybe it was.  That was just a joke that missed.  All right.  Hit it.  Joining the show, Jason Ellis, who does a fine afternoon show on Faction, Sirius 28, XM 52, 3 to 7, every single day.  And then we do a little best stuff for Jason.  Yeah.  On this fine channel, The Virus, on Saturdays from 7 to 9 p.m.  And Jason's in New York, what, the whole week?  I am. 
[02:41:30]  Very cool.  They've got a studio for me and everything.  Anthony, I was just talking to Jason outside the studio.  Yeah.  He's kind of under the radar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I'm explaining a lot of the stuff.  Good luck with that.  Yeah, I know, I know, I know.  That's what I told him.  I go, enjoy your time under the radar because, I mean, his show's getting more and more popular every week,  and eventually you're going to be on the radar.  This is what I told him.  I said, and you might make a little more money and have a bigger show, but you won't have as much fun.  Yeah.  And then I was explaining all the stuff we're not allowed to do on satellite radio that we used to do on regular radio. 
[02:42:00]  He goes, really?  I'm like, yeah, really.  What's up with that shit?  What is up with that shit?  You know what, no disrespect, but maybe they don't think that you'll stab them.  You know what I mean?  I've got that edge.  You know what I mean?  I don't have a job.  I'm crazy.  I don't fucking like anybody.  Maybe I'll just stab somebody if they tell me I can't do something.  It's not going to work, is it?  No, no, at all, unfortunately.  Yeah, yeah, I can kind of.  They get you in the end.  I'm from Australia.  Everybody knows people from Australia are crazy.  You want to bang Samoan bitches, right? 
[02:42:30]  That's what you're saying?  No, I don't think I said Samoan.  You said Mary.  Samoan Mary.  It's very similar.  They're all the same.  Tribal.  Well, I'm not going to say they're all the same because you're black and you'll think  I'm racist because I'm white with tattoos.  Well, that's redundant.  And you didn't have to say anything for me to think that.  Samoan.  Were you thinking that, though?  Yeah.  It pops right out.  Yeah.  Are you racist, Jason?  Of course he is.  Fuck off.  No.  We've been talking about racism all morning.  Him and his friends beat aborigines with fucking didgeridoos every day.  Just to hear him go, ooh, on his fucking head. 
[02:43:00]  Ooh.  I could play didgeridoos.  And I've had sex with an aborigine.  Have you really?  Have you really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not a Maori, but I have an aborigine, yes.  How's that working out?  And Africans.  I've had sex with you.  Well, hold on.  You.  I want to hear about the aborigines.  Is that a tribe in Africa?  The U tribe.  Oh, me?  That's a U.  What's U?  I want to hear about the aborigine, Broad.  You know, it's weird.  What's the difference?  I feel like Australians could be racist, because I've been here a bunch of times, and I went 
[02:43:30]  back, and I met an aborigine girl, and I thought she was really hot, and I noticed when I...  Get the fuck out of here.  What?  I've never seen a hot aborigine girl.  That's racist right there.  What do you mean?  Dude, I have to back him up.  You've seen hot aborigines?  I have to back you up.  Thank you.  I've never seen a hot aborigine.  What about the bitch that won the fucking...  The running bitch from Australia?  With a dick?  What?  Nobody had a dick?  What the fuck?  They all have fucking hair like Hervé Villachez.  Can you type up your...  Yeah, help me out.  I like native hair. 
[02:44:00]  Which chick?  She was a...  Yeah, she can check her out.  She's an Australian chick.  You gotta let her.  You know what?  She wasn't really...  But I would fuck her.  I think she won gold for females.  Put aborigines...  And she didn't have a dick.  None of us know how to spell her.  Australian Olympic runner...  No, just put aborigine Google image there.  Let's start there.  Let's start slow.  They look like...  They're horrendous.  What the fuck?  They're horrendous.  They look like...  How do you say that they're horrendous?  They're horrendous.  Fucking you, Aryan cocksucker. 
[02:44:30]  You know what they look like...  They look like the forensics rebuilding of a skull.  It looked like...  Jason.  Jason.  10,000 years.  Hold on.  Put the clay on it.  Look, I'll have an open mind.  That's not what she looked like.  What the fuck are you showing me?  Jason.  Get a fucking caveman on the fucking screen.  She was a chicken.  She said this dude's 80.  I'll do this for you.  I think they're all horrendous, but I'll have an open mind.  Maybe it changed my mind today.  I get a little knowledge.  She was really cute, and I noticed... 
[02:45:00]  Wait, we might have one already.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, fuck.  The computer went down.  Wait, there you go.  Go down.  Let me see.  Come on.  Almost.  What do you got?  What do you got?  I'm a little short.  She's a fucking three.  You guys are fucked up.  Stop.  Stop.  She's got beautiful eyes.  Before I have an original girl, she's sexy for an average.  She's fucking terrible.  She just turned me a little bit, but not enough.  But that one I was going at with was way hotter than that.  Dude, she's fucking awful. 
[02:45:30]  Better be.  She is not fucking awful.  She's a fucking fool.  Get it out of here.  You're fucking Wesley Snipes with a wig.  That's not awful.  I'm okay for a freak.  She's not okay.  She looks like Don Cheadle.  I'm with Patrice.  She's not the same thing.  Don Cheadle is.  I'm not saying it's awful anymore.  There's a bunch of them that are fuckable.  She's fucking terrible.  But anyway, everyone in Australia didn't like her.  By the way, that's the only one we found that...  There's fucking way more. 
[02:46:00]  I fucked one.  Look at that one.  Click on that bitch.  This one?  Just because she's naked.  That's beside the point.  Look at her head.  Oh, wait, wait.  What about this one bending over?  That's not a fucking aborigine.  It is an aborigine.  See?  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Oh, you fucking white guys think they look the same.  I don't.  Scroll down, Sam.  What are you doing?  You're fucking terrible.  You should get a job on my show.  Aborigines are like two people back on that evolution chart.  You know what?  You've got hair like an aboriginal, actually.  You kind of look like the bitch I fucked in Australia. 
[02:46:30]  Is there a fucking way?  Hey, look away from me, will you?  That's an Asian chick.  That wasn't the one that I was pointing at.  It doesn't work.  Is there a website?  Aboriginal.com?  Something like that.  They're all awful.  Why can't you click on this chick?  Aboriginal girl hot.  That's what I'm...  Click on Aboriginal girl hot.  There you go.  There it is.  Come on.  Stop it.  That's not her.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  That's a teen orgy party.  Are you fucking fine?  It's kind of suckers.  There's no Aboriginal girl on that site.  Look, we haven't found one.  You can't even find them.  Right. 
[02:47:00]  Exactly.  Well, they're mysterious, aren't they?  Type, type, type.  Type, type.  Type, type.  It doesn't even come off a Google.  Wait.  It comes off, did you mean disturbing ugly bitches?  Yeah.  Disturbing them.  You guys could be right.  Well, the one we saw wasn't bad, though.  Yeah.  Not great, but not...  Well, okay, look, what about this, what about this?  Here to go even further, Indian chicks, right?  Usually not that hard.  But what about that one Indian?  What about the one Indian chick in the fucking movie where everyone got an award for it? 
[02:47:30]  What?  That bitch was hot.  Wait, India, India?  But see, yeah, India with the dot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the one who played a lot of guys.  I don't want to sound racist, but a lot of them are not very hot.  You cannot fucking even compare Aborigines to India.  There are some hot, you get a lot of hot Indian, though.  I do.  The fucking with the neck coming off shit.  Yeah, we're not letting you off the hook for this Aborigine thing.  God damn it, somebody needs to send me a photo of the chick I used to go out with.  What, uh, so...  Is that Aborigine?  No, she's hot.  Oh.  What language did she speak? 
[02:48:00]  She spoke fucking English, asshole.  I was like, would we speak Austrian or something?  Did you go out with her a long time?  I went out with her for a while, and a lot of my friends...  All right, so that's why you're defending her.  No, I'm not.  No, because I didn't like her.  She ended up, like, getting addicted to cocaine and shit and trying to steal all my coke.  Hold on.  Joey on Long Island's got something.  We're going to...  He's explaining the Aborigine thing.  Go ahead, Joey.  Hey, Ellis, I want to know if you think the, uh...  Boom.  ...teasement from the Geico commercials are hot.  That's hilarious, you racist fuck.  Look at that.  See, now.  Now what? 
[02:48:30]  And she's Aboriginal.  Now what?  First of all, thank you.  She looks like Nicolini.  She does have a Nicolini in her.  What is she mixed with?  Yeah, she's mixed with something.  Stop it.  No, no, no.  What is she mixed with?  It's where they have her captive.  She's like the green-eyed Chinese chick in the fucking...  In a...  Fucking...  What?  Kurt Russell's movie.  Yeah, Kurt Russell's movie.  Big Trouble in Little China. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, she's the green-eyed Chinese chick.  They got her locked up with a dodo bird.  It's just that.  She's fucking delicious.  They keep her...  That wheelhouse with the orange and the covenants.  They don't like it.  They don't show you that she's four foot six.  She's a fucking...  What's wrong with four foot six?  That is terrible.  First of all, that's bullshit.  I don't understand how it's mixed.  That doesn't look like that?  Yeah, like she didn't...  She had brown eyes, but she was hot.  She's a fucking hot bitch.  That is fucking mixed.  If she was in America, she was fucking hot.  But in Australia, that's why I think Australians are racist. 
[02:49:30]  Because none of my friends thought that my bitch was hot.  And there's a lot of Australians that wouldn't think she's hot.  Not like that?  Yeah.  That's a mixed, motherfucker.  Yeah, that's a mixed.  Her hair is dyed.  She's not...  She's not totally Aboriginal.  That is mongrel right there.  And you can take fucking...  You can take Florida Evans and mix it with some fucking white, white guy.  And a supermodel comes out.  She's got an asshole, you all.  Why can't you mix a good-looking black person with a fucking ugly white man?  Because you can put Florida Evans with some big, fat, white guy. 
[02:50:00]  And a supermodel will shoot out.  And they come out with...  A blue-eyed, fucking, blonde-haired, black supermodel comes out.  I don't know what happens, but that is a mix.  Oh, she's gorgeous, man.  I want to know the story about her stealing your cocaine, though.  I made a...  She got into cocaine, and I said,  Can you go get me some cocaine at a party?  And she was gone for like four hours.  Cocaine in Australia is...  I think the last time I did it, is like $200 a gram.  Wow, fuck. 
[02:50:30]  So it's a big deal to get cocaine.  So she got it, and she took like four hours.  And then she showed up four hours later with like fucking two lines.  And I was like, What the hell?  And she's like, Yeah, they didn't give me much.  And then I could just tell she was gacked out of her both.  With those Gap Origini's nostrils, too.  You're fucking...  Exactly.  You lost your mirror, too, didn't you?  Two fucking little bumps, and it's gone, dude.  You know what it is?  As crazy as fucking Chase is, right?  Motherfuckers, I'm telling you... 
[02:51:00]  People get nervous around Rachel Tongass, motherfucker.  An extreme fighter, everything, and...  Extreme fighter.  Yeah, and then that guy...  Fucking...  From fucking radio, dude.  ...racial shit, just like...  Oh, man.  You can see, like, come on with this, Rachel.  I'm okay with racial shit.  I'm like...  I like you.  Australians...  No, not that you're not racist.  Oh, right.  Australians...  What, they look at it differently?  It's...  Oh, it...  I have no idea.  Racism is a strange...  I didn't notice because I came to America, and I remember the first time I came to America, 
[02:51:30]  and somebody dropped an N-bomb in front of me, and I was like, What the fuck?  That's right.  Yeah.  But Chase, people have said that in front of me.  I'm like, Who the fuck are you, man?  Why are you saying that?  And they're like, Dude, there's a difference.  I don't remember that.  There's black dudes, and there's N-bombs.  And I'm like, That's fucking racist to me.  So I thought America was racist, and then when I went back to Australia, I realized that  they don't say it.  They don't have the N-bomb floating around.  Maybe they do these days.  But...  They didn't then, but they don't...  My friends don't want to fuck black chicks.  How can you not see that? 
[02:52:00]  That word is like Coca-Cola.  Everywhere it goes, it's a hit.  I don't want to fuck black chicks.  Yeah, I don't fuck black chicks.  Yeah, but you're like the I hate poor people shit, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were supposed to say, Oh, I used to be.  You just hate poor people and black people.  You forgot to add black people.  I just hate poor black people.  I hate poor N-bombs. 
[02:52:30]  You don't like rich ones either.  Pussy.  No, I just don't...  People find certain things attractive, and there are certain...  Like I've always said, I would fuck Francine.  The little Francine that comes in.  Is she mulatto?  Like I'm back-banging her.  She's like...  She's a t-t.  She's a t-t.  It's not that she's...  Because Francine's not that pretty.  She's built...  Yeah.  She's built like a little...  Like a little teenage boy.  Like a little white...  Would you think there's a difference between pretty and fuckable? 
[02:53:00]  Yes.  You know what I mean?  Like some chicks I meet sometimes, and I'm like,  You're not that hot, but I know if we fucked, it would be amazing.  There's something fuckable.  Yeah.  Right.  But you don't...  You know what?  Anthony, you don't have that gene...  Like you don't have a dude's vision of pussy.  Like any pussy is like you go,  That pussy's pussy, man.  No, I like Caucasian pussy.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  You should shut that mustache on the sides  and just have a little bit right in the fucking middle,  you creepy pussy.  I wish I could walk around like that.  Francine is... 
[02:53:30]  Hitler ruined that look.  I really wanted that.  Why can't you just say,  Hey, it's the Charlie Chaplin.  No one can fucking believe you.  Hitler fucked that mustache up.  Hitler fucked that mustache up for everybody.  That might have come back.  Like everything comes back.  The goatee, the Fu Manchu,  the fucking handlebar.  Everything over time comes back.  That Hitler mustache, gone forever.  Yeah, just saying hello to people  without waving a hand.  Hailing a cab.  Hey, motherfucker with the little Hitler mustache.  Bring it back.  It's gone.  I want to.  You should try, right?  You should do it now.  I'm going to throw my ass right out of this fucking building 
[02:54:00]  is what they do.  Sirius XM will stop you from shaving your mustache?  Yeah, Jewish upper management  would drop my fucking luck, wouldn't it?  Let's go back to Aborigines.  Hey, that girl is...  Hold on, Ross in Illinois.  Ross?  Yeah.  Hey, Ellis, I've been to Australia.  I've been to East Coast and West Coast.  There are no good-looking Aborigine bitches.  There's no East Coast and West Coast.  What the fuck are you talking about?  That's right.  I'm Australia, you dumb prick. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, he's been there.  He's been there.  Hey, you dumb prick.  It's up to you, man, whenever you're into it.  But you can't find one on the internet.  Also, can I say, Aboriginals, Aboriginals in Australia  are not what you think they are.  Samoans, Fiji, all of those guys, the Polynesian dudes,  those are like the niggas of Australia.  But Aboriginals are like Indians, American Indians here.  They're not people that are just...  The Polynesian chicks are fucking hot.  But I'm saying, Aboriginals are not just around Australia like that. 
[02:55:00]  Tahiti, Polynesian chicks.  They're fucking not just here.  You gotta watch out, they can be dudes, though.  Can they?  Really?  Oh, really?  Potentially.  Ah, fuckers.  I've never seen an Aboriginal chick that was a dude.  You slip up once?  You slip up once?  Have I slipped up once?  You don't listen to my show, do you?  You slip up all kinds of ways.  I know you have.  I'm just trying to tell you the story.  Aboriginals aren't around like that, though, right?  They're very rare to see Aboriginals, right?  If you weren't black right now, I'd say you're racist.  No, he is racist. 
[02:55:30]  He's racist the other way.  I'm racist against everybody.  I've heard that.  Aren't they hard to find?  They're like, if you see an American Indian here, you'll be like, damn, that's a fucking  American Indian.  You don't see Indians.  Yeah.  They are rare.  They are rare.  You are right.  They are very rare.  But it's further up north, not east coast, west coast, you fucking moron.  It's up north where it's very hot.  That's where a lot of the Aboriginals hang out because that's the last place that hasn't 
[02:56:00]  been taken over by the white man.  I've got to go back.  I've got to go back.  With all their money.  You've been there?  Yeah, the white man.  It was the greatest time I've ever had.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I want to hear about this.  It's the best time I've ever had, dude.  Why?  I went in 99.  Where?  In Melbourne.  Oh, you went home.  That's where I'm from.  And it was.  It's Melbourne.  We went there.  We went to do a tour for a month and they hated our comedy.  You know, I'm up there talking my shit.  They just hated us.  Really?  And we had to be.  And this was day one.  So 29 more days.  Oh, shit.  Went to a club. 
[02:56:30]  I never drank before.  This is the only time I ever drank.  Drank every day.  And met women who just married you.  Yeah.  I mean.  And then lick your ass, too.  And then two days.  She was going to.  They're going to lick your ass here.  It's always a plus.  They're going to fall in love with you to lick your ass here.  Dude, I was drunk one night.  My dick didn't get hard.  And the girl was.  She just goes, oh, that's okay.  Is there anything you need me to do?  She wanted to cook a dinner to help my dick get.  And she was.  It's all right.  We're just coddled.  Dude, it was shocking how good they treat you over there. 
[02:57:00]  She was probably going to cook you something with succinylcholine in it and just fucking take you  while you fucking limp American.  I had a great time in Melbourne, man.  Oh, fucking.  Right on.  But, I mean, but they hated you for not.  This was my first, my first, you know, exposure to out of the country.  And they just got mad.  Like I said, can I have some fucking pickles on my sandwich?  And the bitch is like, it's gherkins, you fucking yank thing. 
[02:57:30]  It's like they just take.  Other countries just don't understand how much America doesn't give a shit.  And, and like, I don't want to argue with you over pickles and gherkins, bitch.  It's just like, but that's that thing.  It's just the hatred for men.  Like our money.  And I'll be like, go, look at your stupid money.  It has the, the fucking guy who invented a trolley on the front.  He has dead presidents.  Like it was that, it was that kind of fucking violent back and forth.  Cause it's like, it's cause you're black.  But I learned how to be American outside of America here. 
[02:58:00]  I'm, I'm fucking black there.  I'm, I'm a yank.  So I would have to defend things that I didn't have to defend.  Like the president's top.  Oh, wow.  You know what I mean?  Not that easy.  You're president.  I'd be like, fuck you.  That white man's a good person.  Wow.  Let me tell you something about fucking Reagan.  They're like the black guys in Nam.  When they just be like, you know, in Nam, everything's equal.  Everyone's cool.  Everyone's fucking doing it.  And it's like, what the fuck am I fighting here for? 
[02:58:30]  I'm going to go home and be treated like a nigger.  I got a fucking.  Whoa.  You can say an album and then hate poor people.  Uh, yeah.  Wow.  Pretty much.  I thought you said he couldn't get away with anything on the show.  I rarely say it on the air.  I usually say it behind the closed windows of my escalator.  As he writes it.  He blows steam.  And then writes it.  I learned how to write it backwards in steam on my window.  At first you think of a word.  What's a Gurren?  Shut up.  Fuck. 
[02:59:00]  What a Gurren?  Hey, how's the MMA thing going, man?  Are you taking this seriously?  No, no, I'm not.  I just did it.  I want to do it more, but I have a...  My daughter...  My wife won't let me have any more fights until my son's older or some shit.  So, I'm too old, so it's probably over already.  I just wanted to have one room.  You're not old if Herschel Walker's fucking doing it.  Herschel Walker's a fucking steaming pile of shit.  Thank you.  Wow.  You gotta be joking.  Fucking racist.  That's what you're trying to say.  That's what you're trying to say.  Oh, no, I hate him because he's black. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  If he was a white guy, I'd be like, this guy's the best fighter I've ever seen.  It's not his fault.  It's not his fault.  I talked about it on my show.  Strike Force, they got him because he's a name and it brings people to watch him.  But fighting, his level of fighting, I would beat the shit out of him and I'm a terrible  cage fighter.  But he's famous.  I get it.  I'm into him just because he's a 48-year-old man that looks like that.  That's ripped.  And he looks like he can't.  Right, you're into hard buddies.  I know I said, that sounds gay, but just a...  Because I'm 40 and I just want to have some hope. 
[03:00:00]  You didn't train your whole life, though.  The guy's been training since he was five or something.  And it's genetics, too.  Let me ask you a question about Fedor.  Your opinion, is it anybody you think better, take him, that can take him?  Yeah.  King Mo.  Black guy.  King Mo!  Yeah.  He's not getting any credit, man.  I don't know King Mo.  King Mo's not getting credit yet because he needs to pay his rent.  Steve, our producer.  King Mo.  King Mo, man.  I say King Mo is the next, the big guy.  People like King Mo, but he's not getting any... 
[03:00:30]  Well, he's got to pay his dues, man.  He's only had a couple of fights.  He's got to fight a real fighter.  He hasn't fought anybody good yet.  Who the fuck's King...  I don't know.  King Mo's, he's a wrestler.  Did you see that MMA's all wrestling?  Like, the best fighter in the world is the best wrestler if he's got good hands.  Well, this dude's by far the best wrestler that's ever been in mixed martial arts.  And he's really athletic and he has really fast hands.  He hits heavy.  He can take a punch.  So, it looks like, on paper, he could beat anybody.  Is he a strike force?  Yeah.  He just fought, he got fined like 10 grand for smashing, pouring Rockstar over his head 
[03:01:00]  in the cage.  Fucking asshole.  What do you think of Brett Rogers?  He fought, I mean, until he got knocked out.  Damn, that was a surprise.  Matt, that Brett Rogers was right.  Yeah, he looked like he was doing alright too, but everybody looks like they're doing  alright until they get beat up by Favre.  But Favre seems to be relying lately on fucking one punch, like against Arlovsky.  He seems to really be like waiting for that one punch instead of fucking tapping people.  Well, that's why he wins, because he's calm.  He just waits.  You know what I mean?  When he's under pressure, when you're beating the shit out of him and you break his nose,  his eyes are still open and he's waiting for that counterpunch. 
[03:01:30]  He doesn't...  Is he the best guy out there, you think?  I think mentally he's the best guy, but I don't think he's...  You know what I mean?  I think...  Lesnar wouldn't take him?  Lesnar?  Brock, yeah.  I don't...  You know, I would love to say that dude's awesome, but I fucking hate that dude.  I don't hate anybody, but the cock on his chest and the fucking weird gay haircut.  It freaks me out.  So, no.  But maybe, you know, I don't think Fader's as good as everyone thinks.  Things have changed.  How about Silver, the spider?  You think Silver can take him, or he's just too big for Silver? 
[03:02:00]  I don't...  I think that...  I think he's the best pound fighter right now, for sure.  Because he's the fastest.  He's the best at everything.  But he's...  The Fader thing is...  I don't get it, but it still keeps happening.  But, I mean, like you said, he hasn't been tested by the new best guy.  He's got a little older, though.  I mean, look...  But he's got to get a co-tour.  He's like 45.  And he's so fucking amazing.  When Fader was the best dude in Pride, and now all the other dudes that were in Pride,  the axe murderer and all those dudes, they're not the best dudes in their weight class. 
[03:02:30]  Right, right.  So, you know, and Strikeforce...  Fact is, Strikeforce aren't the best dudes.  The best dudes are in the UFC.  Nick Diaz, Nick Diaz is...  Nick Diaz is actually, after that last fight, I think he's the best fighter in the world.  But I don't think he's the best pound for pound or whatever that is.  I just think he's the best.  To me, he is fighting.  I've never seen anyone have more fun punching someone in the face and being punched in the face  than anybody in the world.  What weight class is he?  Middleweight.  He's the champ.  No, welterweight. 
[03:03:00]  Sorry.  And Couture did win over the weekend.  Yeah, he did.  He beat Coleman.  Did he beat him Coleman?  He beat Larry King.  It's a fucking dust storm in the cage.  Those guys are fucking riddles.  He beat him Larry King.  All that big motherfucker.  Mark Coleman's a tough dude, though, man.  They're all tough dudes, man.  They're all...  I'm just talking shit.  Fucking Mark Coleman.  He's a man's man.  I loved it when he talked shit on Tito.  Because Tito...  You hear Tito talking shit in the back of the cage?  No, no, I hear...  Coleman's getting the interview with Joe Rogan, and then Coleman turns away from the interview  and says some shit like,  Fuck you!  to the cage. 
[03:03:30]  It's Tito.  Tito was talking shit to him.  And what kind of guy talks shit to the guy after he got beat up?  Right.  So he was like,  Fuck you, I'll fight you any day, you douchebag.  And I thought it was awesome.  Tito's going to fight again in the UFC.  Yeah, he's going to get knocked out by Chuck again.  Are they fighting Chuck?  Yeah.  Liddell's coming back?  Did he know that?  No.  The ultimate fighter is the two coaches.  They're Tito and Chuck.  I did not know that.  Wow.  I don't watch the ultimate fire.  Chuck, he's back.  I tell you, it's Dana's game plan.  Take Chuck.  Put him in Dancing with the Stars.  Get all the homos. 
[03:04:00]  No pun.  I mean, I'm trying to be friendly.  You know, suck a dick.  It's cool.  Yeah.  Bring the people that watch gay television to the UFC and then get more fans.  Build a fucking audience.  It was a plan.  I say Dana and Chuck playing this out the whole time.  You think Liddell can still fight?  Can Chuck Liddell still fight?  He had Tito's number, man.  On that level.  Fuck yeah.  He just needs to...  His brain needs to rest.  Did Kimbo Slice win?  Did Kimbo Slice win that thing?  But no.  But Kimbo's fucking...  He should fucking kill Hershel Walker.  That'd be awesome.  Just fucking put that dude in a coma and end it. 
[03:04:30]  Sorry.  He's a good guy.  He's a great guy.  But Tito is never been able to beat Liddell, man.  Liddell really had his numbers.  But Chuck is close to 45, isn't he?  He was 43.  He's in his mid-40s.  Yeah.  He knocked out the last week.  And he enjoys the life.  Knocked out bad.  It's from Sam.  What is he doing?  Knocked out bad.  Tito has no hands.  Tito's hands are terrible.  I kept hearing about how good his hands are in his last fight because now he has Freddie  Roach, the boxer guy that makes everybody's hands great. 
[03:05:00]  His hands looked fucking terrible in his last fight.  What was that?  How he fought?  Who was it against?  He lost and complained about his eye socket and all that shit after the fight.  He just went on a tear after he lost about my eye, my back, my fucking ribs, my brain.  I was like, oh my God.  Just leave.  You lost.  Leave.  This is Tito.  Tito.  Oh, he fought back in the UFC again?  Yeah.  Oh, he did.  Okay.  Who was it?  The guy that loses too, but they love him so much.  He's always...  I think Dana White loves him because he thinks that he put UFC on the map. 
[03:05:30]  Forrest?  Forrest.  Yeah.  He does love Forrest.  That's what it was.  Tito fought Forrest?  Again.  I've been out of this fucking game.  Twice.  Yeah.  He lost.  He lost.  He turned to nothing in the third round.  He had nothing for him.  We had Forrest in here.  Have you had him on the show?  He's great, but I met him two weeks later.  No memory of meeting me.  Really?  No memory.  He wasn't rude.  He had no memory of meeting me.  He's got one ball.  You fucking mediocre ball.  He's got one ball?  I don't remember you.  How did he lose his ball?  How did he lose his ball? 
[03:06:00]  He talked about it.  It got ripped off.  What the fuck?  It got ripped off?  I'm still stuck in my Patrice's comment.  He got some kind of a hernia, didn't he?  And then it rotted or something.  And then his ball rotted.  He had to have it taken out.  It rotted.  I don't know.  Maybe someone got cut off to it and it just rotted.  Does he have kids?  He doesn't have kids, does he?  I don't know.  What do you have on your show?  Who do you interview usually?  What's your thing?  Anybody.  Same as what you guys do, except not as high a level because nobody fucking gives a shit.  Well, he's out there in LA just hiding. 
[03:06:30]  But I do get people tattooed.  I get tattoos and I can punch people in the face and poke them with stuff.  Was that your show that Pink punched you in the face?  Yeah.  That was your show?  Yeah.  Did she hit hard?  Yeah.  She went live the first time.  She was drinking.  That's the other thing.  She got wasted.  She stayed the whole show.  So by the end of the show, she was...  Knee deep in a couple of bottles of red wine and she had her top off and she was like,  I'm going to fucking punch you in the face again.  I was like, go for it.  While I was on the microphone saying, yeah, you know, tomorrow we'll be back with fucking 
[03:07:00]  boom and punch me.  She was getting all amped on it.  Is that hurt?  No, I don't get hurt.  I'm like, uh...  That's good.  Really tough.  You take a good punch.  Yeah.  I don't do drugs anymore.  So when you punch me, if you punch me hard, my brain gets tingly and it's like a free  rush and my wife doesn't get mad at me, but I'm doing drugs.  You know what I mean?  Are you going to bondage and stuff like that?  I'm surprised you don't go to like dungeons then.  I would love to fucking stab somebody, but I'm not...  No, no, no.  I'm not what I'm into it.  You being tied up.  He can't.  Fuck it.  Tie me up, Jake.  If you're into being hurt or something, I'm saying a lot of shit. 
[03:07:30]  Choke me, motherfucker.  No, I wouldn't want to do it.  I'm hard right now.  No, I would be into that, but I never got around to it.  Remember the guy we had on our show that liked getting kicked in the fucking balls?  I'm kicking.  I don't like that.  Dude.  We saw this guy take some shots.  I saw the video.  I know the one you're talking about.  Was it when girls came from running out of another room into the room where he was?  Yeah, it was the real deal.  The running...  The harder, the better for this guy.  He was so fucking into it.  It was one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen on our show that I just couldn't  handle or wrap myself around. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, I'm not into penis punishment.  Do you know some of these guys like Eric Banner or some of the Australian counterparts?  I've been living here for almost 20 years.  I'm over here, man.  I wanted to be an American when I was like 14.  I wanted to be a pro skateboarder and skateboarding sucks in Australia.  So then that and then this.  So you know Tony Hawk and these guys?  Yeah, I swing off his balls into this studio.  That's how I got here.  Really?  Yeah, if it wasn't for the Birdman, you wouldn't know me.  How old is he?  50?  That's kind of fucked up.  Are you looking to fucking go right now?  I just said I swing off his balls. 
[03:08:30]  You calling him 50?  He's 40.  Oh, okay.  41.  10 years less than fucking.  10 years?  You're a little off.  I feel like when he's 50, it's over.  It seems like I've heard that fucking name forever.  It seems like he's been around forever.  He has.  That's because he was like 14 when he turned pro.  How about the Hawaiian kid that went to jail?  Christian Hosoi.  I fucking saw something about him too.  What's that about?  He did a bunch of crystal meth and.  He was supposed to be great, best, better than Tony.  Yeah, he was never.  He was a lot of other people's favorite skateboarder because he had a better style.  He was like a cool guy.  Tony Hawk was a nerdy guy. 
[03:09:00]  Tony Hawk was a competition guy.  No one could ever beat Tony Hawk in competition, ever.  It's never been done.  Now it is because he's older, but in Tony Hawk's heyday, when I came to America, I was training.  I was taking people out, getting better, getting better.  I was like top five in the world.  I was like, you guys are all fucked.  I'm going to eat all of you alive.  And then I went, saw Tony in a contest, saw him do a ride in front of me, against me.  And I was like, oh, well, fucking, you know what I mean?  Top five's pretty good.  Top five's not bad.  That was the end of it. 
[03:09:30]  I was like, I now know that I will never be the number one dude in skateboarding.  What did he do?  It was so impressive.  He never fell.  He never, in a contest, he never, because to be consistent every now and then, yeah,  okay, but never, ever did he ever fall.  And if anything ever got bad in the air, he had this thing where he could squat.  If you don't skate, if you sit in a ball, like curl up in a ball standing on your skateboard,  because if you're in the air and you're coming back in and your wheels are going to clip  the coping on the way back in the edge of the ramp, there's nothing you can do about 
[03:10:00]  that.  But you can curl up into a ball and land in a ball and then come back down the ramp.  He could actually, his ass could hit the ground and then he'd stand back up.  See, if I do a 10-foot air and I'm going to lock up and I curl into a ball and then stay  into a ball down the ramp, my legs will snap.  This is scientific shit about legs.  Like if I saw all what he said, all I'll be doing is watching, going, look at this  asshole falling.  That's it.  It's what you do.  You know what I mean?  Whatever you do, you learn more about it.  Like, you know, comedians that suck. 
[03:10:30]  I just think they're all hilarious.  I don't know.  So who's the, who's the, who is the best right now?  The best dude right now would probably be, who would it be?  I would say the best dude right now would probably be Pierre Luke or Bucky Lassick.  You know what I mean?  There's a couple of dudes now.  It's not, that was the other thing.  Tony Hawk was the best dude.  It wasn't a, Christian Osoy had the best style.  Every now and then they would give Christian the contest.  Even though we all knew Tony Hawk had won, they gave it to Christian because he had a 
[03:11:00]  better style and he, he had hair extensions and, you know.  What about Jason Lee?  Jason Lee is an actor.  Well, he's tricky.  Check it out.  What about beforehand though?  He's a fucking street skater.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He is a really, street skaters don't count to be good.  This is a contest.  Both dudes are competitive guys.  Street skaters are more artists.  With a mouse.  This is a Delmar, this is a Delmar's contest.  This is Delmar back in the day.  This is video I saw in Australia that made me want to go to America and fuck with these  What year is this?  85.  85. 
[03:11:30]  And I didn't mean skateboarding.  I meant would you fuck him?  Would I fuck Jason Lee?  Yeah.  Uh, I mean, if, if he talks shit on my wife, yeah.  That's funny.  Is that inside stuff?  I don't know.  Am I lost?  He's an actor.  Okay.  See that?  See that?  See that?  See how he balled up right then?  That's when I, that's when everyone else falls.  He just did it right there already.  His first wall, he fucked up and he, and he still made it.  See, I didn't recognize that as a fuck up.  I know nothing about skateboarding.  Yeah, but you're funny.  You can't have it all. 
[03:12:00]  Thank you.  See, he's a nerd.  So let me see the beginning again where he falls.  I didn't even know.  Jason noticed it.  I didn't notice it.  He is.  And that was a, that was a, he, you know what?  Put in the, the 900, the first 900 he made at the X Games.  That's the biggest demonstration of all.  The 900, tons of people can spin it.  Oh, God, is that you?  No.  Are you farting in here?  No.  Holy shit.  Wow.  You fucking lie.  It's like a four-year-old saying they didn't fart.  That's so funny.  I had a lot of bad food yesterday.  Yeah, watch this.  This is the first 900. 
[03:12:30]  The first 900 ever, ever made.  In competition.  And, well, it was in a.  Oh, that was the first one ever done.  All right.  It was just the first one ever done, ever.  But watch the way he lands.  No, but there's maybe two people in the world that can, that can roll away in this position.  His hand is on the ground behind him.  You're so.  Yeah, I know.  Where's the one where he makes it?  Oh, they're dramatizing it for us.  Oh, so somebody who likes him is like.  Are you at the Burt Ramp?  Let's go.  Wow.  I'm so stoked they got to smell Jimmy's ass.  How the fuck do they have to make this into a long video? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, what is this?  Let's just show his show.  Show his hotel checkout?  Yeah, really?  Now, a pan of the crowd and a bridge?  Let's show the fucking move.  They're going to fucking dramatize it again.  I can already tell.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, there's too much time left in the video.  What is a 900, Jason?  That's.  Really?  Oh, Jesus.  That's a 900.  And he missed it again.  Spinning.  It's mathematics.  That's how many times you spin.  360 is once around.  Two and a half.  Two and a half times around.  Wow.  Yeah, but it's the thing.  Because you spin so much, it's so hard to come to a stop. 
[03:13:30]  Because you spin so much.  When you land, you kind of keep spinning.  And it's a really dangerous trick.  Because if you actually tried to stand up on it, with all the momentum you've got of spinning,  you're going to keep spinning when you land and land on the back of your head on the flat.  And, you know, you get knocked the fuck out.  But how does he, how does he, how do you keep your board in mid-air?  What do you mean?  How do you keep it on your feet?  Really?  Yeah.  Is that the question you're asking?  Yes.  Do you know what fucking year it is, dude?  That shit, that was the question people asked, like, in 85.  You fucking hold it with your hand.  Open your eyes. 
[03:14:00]  Look at his hand.  He's holding the board while he's spinning, you fucking geriatric prick.  We all know that shit.  Look at his hand.  Watch his hand.  Grab the board.  See?  His hand's on the board.  Watch it.  He's got his hand on it.  Spinning, spinning, spinning.  He missed it again.  Man, if you got the one where he fucking makes it.  This is not a good commercial.  No, this guy's a bum.  Fucking Tony Clifton is about to skateboard.  Yeah, this is looking bad, Jason.  We're trying to get this. 
[03:14:30]  No, it looks like Prince Charles.  This is a fucking eight-minute video.  For the love of fuck.  The video is showing you how he would never give in.  It's the drama of skateboarding.  Never give up.  Never give in, kids.  Everybody's looking up.  This might be it.  Don't forget to brush your teeth and never give in.  This might be the one.  It's not the one.  It's not the one.  It's going to be the one.  First of all, it's not the one.  We're two minutes in.  I know, I know.  It's nine-minute video.  They're going to slow-mo it seven times after.  I'm hoping for some slow-mo and a lot of replays.  One.  Oh, this is it?  Two.  Two and a half. 
[03:15:00]  No.  Oh, fucking slow-mo.  He fell again.  Put the fucking one-minute one in you.  Fuck, no.  Look it.  Just one minute.  Yes, Sam, please.  Hang on a minute.  Wait a minute.  No, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do that.  Are we bailing on this clip?  Yes.  We have to.  It's 12 minutes in the full-mo and a lot of minutes.  Tony Hawk, 900.  It's a minute, 52 seconds long.  All right, this could be it.  Yeah, the chick only takes like three seconds.  He looks like a fan.  Here we go.  Over Shaq and Iverson.  Sal Masekela giving him props. 
[03:15:30]  He's so rich, man.  He is.  Six flags.  One, two and a half.  He missed.  This is a one-minute video.  I think he's going to show all the ties.  It's okay.  It's good.  Wow, okay.  To finally do it.  Oh, we almost have to.  Look at that one, Jason.  Okay, here we go.  Look at the intensity.  This is very angry.  No one had ever done this.  And there's like five or six of us that had span it, but no one had ever rode away.  And the only way he rode away on the first one ever is because watch what he fucking does  when he lands.  One, two, two and a half.  That. 
[03:16:00]  Get the side down here.  You can't do that.  People can't do that.  And the white crowd goes crazy.  His ass went all the way down.  His ass hit the board.  The all-white crowd goes mad.  There's not one black guy that gives a flying fuck that he just did that.  Do you think he cares?  No.  You don't care?  No.  I think...  You shed a black to you?  Uh-oh, who's that?  Oh, shit.  Who's that black guy?  He's the announcer.  Of course.  He was really happy about it, so you're wrong.  Oh, my gosh.  Yes. 
[03:16:30]  Hey, that's me.  Where are you?  How the fuck did I get on there?  Where are you?  I had hair.  Where are you?  Fucking father time, you cocksucker.  By the way, that black guy's a fan of our show.  He does this.  He does he?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  My idol.  Look at you.  Look at me here.  Is that you?  Stoned as a monkey's ass.  Good for me.  What were they asking you?  What happened?  Let's hear this shit.  What were they asking you?  I was probably about to say fuck, so they only hit...  God.  Tony Hawkins.  See how wasted I am?  That's all I did.  Just go wasted all the time.  All right, let's listen.  Right here.  My idol, my savior, God, Tony Hawkins. 
[03:17:00]  Wow.  I should not be on television.  Well edited clip.  Was you naturally ginger there, my friend?  Is that ginger hair?  Yeah, yeah, I'm a fucking Aryan.  Filming.  Filming, brother.  I don't have any problems with ginger.  That's English people that don't like the ginger.  I fucking hate English people.  They fuck kids.  They hate you back there, Braveheart.  They don't like...  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  They don't like fucking ginger hair, man.  They don't like you.  They're fucking wearing fucking wigs  and making a bunch of rules.  You look so fucking young, dude. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Father Tom.  It's a cocksucker.  What do you look like in there?  You look like somebody else.  You do look like somebody.  You look like a young, eager lad.  Who?  A young, eager lad.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  I was a young, eager lad.  Actually, that's a lot.  That's why you had hope.  I'm already washed up there.  You had hope.  I didn't have hope.  I have hope now.  There's hope.  Until I listen to your fucking show  and you tell me that when my show gets big  that everyone's going to fuck me in the ass  and tell me I'm not allowed to do anything  and I'm going to be so drained from fighting for my show  that I won't even care about what I say on the radio anymore. 
[03:18:00]  You won't care anymore.  You won't care.  You'll have your bag in your hand  the second you're fucking ready to walk out of here.  The minute your show's over,  you'll be racing to the elevator.  Isn't it good that you have cars and shit, though?  Isn't that?  It doesn't make up for it?  It's nice.  I got to give you that.  I'm trying to get some white information here, man.  Oh, okay.  I just like this is really...  Go ahead, black person.  Yeah, who has no rich car or anything?  Dude, I'm trying to get some information  to understand culturally this. 
[03:18:30]  He is legitimately what he is  in terms of some people in society  didn't earn their status as what they are.  He has earned that.  He is as good as advertised.  Half the money everybody in skateboarding makes,  if any of them are listening right now,  should be fucking sending him 10% of it.  He's the reason that we're legitimate.  So the fact that he has fucking roller coasters and...  He legitimized the sport.  Because the rest of us were...  He's the only guy that was still a normal guy  who didn't have an ego  and made people think that skateboarders 
[03:19:00]  don't all fucking do drugs and mug people  because he's the only person who didn't.  Who's the fuck...  He brought him mainstream.  Who's the fuck...  Some people hate him for that.  Let's bring some money up.  Who's the fuck Tony Hawk guy?  Like, who's the guy that's like,  fuck him, I'm better than him guy.  You gotta be a rival.  Nobody's rival.  Nobody...  Jesus.  I think he would have been pissed for sure.  I can't think of a more topical one.  I know.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, some people just have a nemesis.  There was...  Well, Christian Osoi was his nemesis.  How long was he in jail for?  He's out now. 
[03:19:30]  How long did he go for?  I don't know.  Like, five or six years.  He was supposed to...  Were you doing crystal meth?  No, he's trying to smuggle, like, kilos of it into Hawaii or something like that.  Oh.  Yeah.  And his career's over?  No, he's back.  His career's over.  His career was already over before he went to jail.  Okay.  There was no...  Tony Hawk is a freak of nature.  Everybody from Tony Hawk's generation can't skate like he can.  He's the only guy...  I did a demo with him a while ago, and he fucking almost made another 900.  Do you think he still zips around on a skateboard?  He skates every day.  Does he? 
[03:20:00]  I hate skateboards.  You don't like the skateboards?  I can go on a straight line.  My arms are out, and I fall.  I can go ten feet on a skateboard.  It's fucking awful.  I've got to say.  A lot of the best guys are 40 in their 40s, man.  That's a lie.  A lot...  The guys I fucking know...  No.  Every time they show...  They don't show young...  Oh, wait.  Who's a top motherfucker?  Everybody in skateboarding is...  Paul Rodriguez's son.  Yeah.  P-Rod.  It's a street skater.  There's two different skateboarders now.  Street skaters are...  The new skateboarders.  Nobody cares about the Tony Hawk and me skateboarder. 
[03:20:30]  We're ramp skateboarders.  We're old school.  You're not in X Games anymore.  No.  They don't have that in X Games anymore.  These guys now are like...  Well, they actually go on the Mega Ramp contest.  But they don't have skateboarding in X Games anymore.  Well, well, slow down.  Yeah, they do.  Listen about the Mega Ramp.  Now it's downstairs and fucking...  Well, the Mega Ramp is the only thing that...  And we talked about this last time Jason was on.  The guy that fell what?  Jake Brown.  How many feet did he fall?  50.  Oh, that was scary, dude.  Jason was right there when it happened.  That was scary.  That was one of his boys.  Yeah, that's... 
[03:21:00]  He's the other Australian.  And he's done that.  He's done the Mega Ramp.  That fucking thing is scary.  Yeah, that's why I'm in radio.  Because I did the Mega Ramp.  And I was like, fuck, I've got like...  I'm probably going to die doing this.  Did you hurt yourself?  Tons of times.  I have a piece of my ass missing from hitting the coping.  Knocked a hematoma or whatever and...  You knocked a piece of your ass off?  Yeah, a hole from where I hit from the hematoma, a piece of the meat evaporated.  And then a piece of my ass moved into that hole.  So one of my cheeks is different to the other. 
[03:21:30]  Jesus.  Wait, when he...  Fucking straight ass cheeks.  From falling, man.  Yeah.  That's insane.  That's fucked up.  When he went down that hill, why didn't he just...  Down that hill.  Jesus Christ.  How fucking old are you, man?  It's amazing.  It's not my fucking grandmother.  It's not a hill.  When he went down that hill.  That looks fun.  Whee!  How many feet I go, Jimmy?  How many feet does this thing go up?  The Mega Ramp is 30 feet high. 
[03:22:00]  And this is you doing it, right?  Yeah, this is me.  God damn it.  I would never do that.  That's when I stole the police car.  That's insane.  I would fall off.  Yeah.  You think?  What's the best Mega Ramp video going?  Let's see a...  Oh, that's the one where the guy fell, unfortunately.  Yeah, of course it is.  That is the most exciting thing.  Everybody loves near death.  Yeah.  Show the guy falling one time.  I don't want to see a guy just grabbing the bottom of the skateboard.  Anyone can do that.  Grabbing the bottom of the skateboard.  Can you fucking write a book on how to skateboard?  Yeah.  Because I would buy that shit, dude.  Yeah, hop on sideways, you zip down. 
[03:22:30]  Grabbing the bottom and going down the hill.  Watch this.  You've seen this video?  Yeah.  It's fucking hard.  This is from the...  This guy's very unprofessional.  The Mega Ramp.  Everybody knows that name.  Jake Brown.  The Jake Brown crash.  720.  First person to do it in contest.  Wow.  And then fucking death.  Damn, man.  You're right.  See, that's me right there.  You're the first one in?  Yeah.  Trying to maintain his coolness. 
[03:23:00]  Look at...  Rewind this.  Watch how everybody else runs in and chases it to make sure his hat didn't fall out.  You know what I mean?  Wait, go...  Keep going.  Watch this.  Watch how he runs in.  Oh, yeah.  What's going on?  You all right, bud?  You know what?  Right there...  That's so funny that I did that because right there is when I saw...  He was...  His eyes were open and he wasn't breathing or anything.  So I thought he...  I thought he died.  So the first thing I felt when he died was to adjust my hat.  And you just pointed out.  That's like one of my fucking best friends right there.  When I thought he died, I adjusted my fucking hat.  Watch how everybody else runs out. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What's going on?  I didn't know what to do.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  He might be dead.  I'm like, what?  What?  You knew this would be seen by a lot of people.  That's right, baby.  What saved him?  Because it's an instinct that you try to run in midair.  But what prevented him from actually dying?  Oh, will you explain this?  I don't remember.  He was able to move at the last second to kind of...  Well, he actually took the fall on his back.  That's...  Yeah.  On purpose.  Yeah.  Knowing that was the best thing he could do, right? 
[03:24:00]  Is he okay?  You know, like, okay?  Yeah, you know, he's...  He was...  In the next day, he was...  When they let him in a hospital, he was fucking drinking and DJing and he's hotel room.  He's still skating?  Fuck it.  Yeah?  I would never skate again.  What were the injuries?  I'd go up three-foot hills.  He had a lacerated kidney and lacerated lung and fractured wrist.  That's it?  That's it.  That's it.  I mean, that's a lot, but I mean...  I say it was already lacerated.  That dude drinks and smokes like a fucking maniac.  Look at useless ass Jason Stilett.  You gotta watch this!  I'm not a medic!  Wait, I can't touch the guy!  Why won't you just walk away with my toxic guy? 
[03:24:30]  You know what I did, you motherfucker?  He's still looking like, what the fuck?  No, no, I'm holding...  I'm itching his leg.  The first thing I did when he woke up, because at first...  You almost stepped on him, first of all.  Yeah.  But I didn't see him.  I'm like, Jakey!  Jakey, wake up, Jakey!  And then he goes...  And then he goes, because his eyes are open and he's not...  There's no breath.  That was the thing that freaked me out, because he knocked everything out of him, and then  after a couple of seconds, he goes...  And I'm like, oh my God!  But then I was like, okay, he's alive, and then when he was still... 
[03:25:00]  Then he started to come to, and then I started to itch his...  Because all those other dudes were like...  They weren't doing anything.  They were just saying, stay calm, stay still.  I knew Jake couldn't understand what anything they were saying, because he's Australian,  so I was itching his leg where the skin was, because as soon as his eyes came back  to the world, I was like...  Because I thought, he's dead, he's not dead, he's in a wheelchair.  So I was scratching his leg, I was like, Jakey, can you feel your leg?  Can you feel that?  He's like, yeah, mate, where am I? 
[03:25:30]  I was like, fuck you, I don't even care about you anymore.  Because that's all I care about.  Are you dead?  No.  Can you walk?  Yeah.  Fuck off.  Is my hat straight?  Yes.  How my sponsor's watching this right now?  How's my hat look, mate?  Hat life legs.  I love that you picked up on that.  Yeah, you did.  That's fucking awesome.  It's instinct, man.  I got the flavor.  Don't hate.  Come on.  Hey, listen.  I got the blackness.  I think we're starting to...  We got a few more minutes, but we're running out of show.  What's this Ellis Mania 5 all about?  Ellis Mania 5 is my...  Why are we invited, motherfucker? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, why not?  Do you want to?  Do you want to go, really?  No, I don't want to go to Vegas.  Vegas is, you know...  Vegas, that's a boring place.  Why would you want to go there?  Would you really go?  I don't think you guys would be interested.  If this was in Columbus, Ohio, the answer would be no.  But it's Vegas.  You gotta go, then.  You gotta go.  What is it?  There's gonna be some black people there, Anthony, so you might want to just let them kick it  here.  There's a lot of poor people, too.  I'm all right.  Maybe I could get you, like, a glass box.  You can sit in so the poor people can't touch it.  I usually stay in the high-rollers section.  Vegas, black people got a little money.  Just the riffraff.  That's why I'm not inviting you.  There is no high-rollers section in Ellis Mania. 
[03:26:30]  We're all one.  What is Ellis Mania?  This is number five, so this has been, you know, successful for you.  Well, if you go on the web, ellismania.com, that's the website, but Ellis Mania is a fight.  Because after I had my fights, I talked about it on the radio and how it was a life-altering  experience for me because, you know, being a pro fighter on the UFC level is one thing,  but for a normal person to train, because I put in, like, a year and a half, and then  I had my first boxing fight.  Then I had a cage fight.  It's a big deal to just step in the cage with that kind of background. 
[03:27:00]  A lot of these other guys have had 10 years in the game, so it was very nerve-wracking  for me, and the training and cutting weight, it changed my life forever.  It made me a tougher person.  So that made my fans want to be a part of something.  I was like, you know what?  Let's have a fucking Ellis Mania at the boxing gym, and we'll make up funny fights, because  I don't want people that aren't that committed to punch each other and actually hurt each  other, because I think Ellis Mania 2, I had, like, two truck driver guys fight each  other, and in the first 15 seconds, one of them got knocked out and collapsed on himself, 
[03:27:30]  and I was like, oh my god, what have I done?  And he was alright.  But, uh, shout out to Crazy Jer, but anyway.  Dude, we had blind boxing, and one guy broke, I don't know, three or four ribs and fucking  had a spleen.  Was he a fan?  He had a spleen problem, and he almost died.  He fought with a spleen problem?  No, no.  He got a spleen problem from the front.  Yeah, because when you're blind, you can't, like, get ready for a punch.  Yeah, well, I have, I have blindfolded.  So these guys were getting their asses and it's all.  Yeah, you can't tighten up your stomach.  You can't tighten, you can't do shit.  It's blind Dave. 
[03:28:00]  You get blasted.  He now calls Ron and Fez more than us, but he took a fucking beating for our show.  Well, I see, I make it safer.  I've made all these other fights that are a little bit more modified so that people can't,  you know what I mean, get a full cracking punch on each other.  I have three people fighting each other blindfolded with electric dog collars on their necks,  and then the other people get to electrocute those guys.  The last one I had, Tim Sylvia was there, so he came into the ring once we put the blindfolds  on the dudes.  So he was in there with one glove, just giving them free putt shots. 
[03:28:30]  So that was fucking hilarious.  Ellismania.com if you want to look at it, but then there's all these other, we're doing  the Don Fry fights when you duct tape your hand to the back of the other guy's head.  Oh, shit.  And you both got one boxing glove.  Wow.  You just fucking hockey punch each other.  Get the fuck out of here.  Don Fry is fucking amazing.  I've never heard that term before.  That dude's a legend.  I've never heard of it.  Don Fry, man.  If you look on Google, motherfucker.  Yeah, let's Google.  Half Aboriginal slack ass.  Anyway.  You think he's black? 
[03:29:00]  We think he is.  No.  I'm not touching that.  You can't have a shaved head and be white.  Don Fry is just a tough dude.  But there's a fight.  Don Fry fights a Japanese dude.  I forgot the dude's name.  But they fucking, they just lock, they hate each other.  And as soon as the fight starts, they grab the back of each other's head.  They go into the corner.  They just punch each other in the fucking head for like four minutes straight.  Why'd they hate each other?  Look at this monster.  They're real fighters.  This is the greatest fight I've ever seen in mixed martial arts.  But that big guy, it's Fedor, I beat the shit out of that big guy.  It's, uh, what is he, Tucker Arma. 
[03:29:30]  Look at these two.  Look how sweet they are.  Fry's a big dude.  And now you're called to Don Fry?  Yeah.  Fighting style?  You know, you're going to put fake mustaches on and punch each other in the face.  This guy's got a fucking solid mustache.  This is a real, there's no MMA, there's no skill involved in this.  Look at this.  Here we go.  Here we go.  And they're off.  Off to the races.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  He's holding the back of his head.  That's the fucking greatest fight you've ever seen.  You're fucking laughing right there.  God damn it.  Wishes he could get these two back in the cage.  God damn it. 
[03:30:00]  Are you fucking kidding me?  And the Asian dude's losing because he's trying to knee and Don's like, fuck the knees.  Look at the blood.  The Asian dude's eye is already closed up.  Get the fuck out of here.  I gotta shin this motherfucker.  And don't forget, these guys are complete, like, these guys are 250 pounds and they are  fully on steroids fucking raging right now.  It's in Japan.  They're doing everything illegal.  They're elbows to the face.  Unbelievable.  Devastating.  That is unbelievable.  Look it up.  Don Fry on YouTube.  And it's not RYE.  Don Fry against Yosushi or whatever. 
[03:30:30]  Yosushi.  You're a fucking asshole.  They punch themselves out.  I like Japanese.  I like Chinese people too.  Oh, put me under that bus.  What's that?  They're like, they punch themselves out, man.  Yeah, they get the second wind to get back into it again.  Wow, that's unbelievable.  It's old school, man.  Old school's way tougher.  So you're doing one of those where they duct tape.  We're doing that and I'm fighting Mark Zupan.  You know, the dude from Murderball.  Shaved head crazy fucking dude.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I'm fighting him in a wheelchair fight.  Right on.  I'm going to get in a wheelchair and beat the fuck out of his paraplegic ass. 
[03:31:00]  Huh?  Who is that?  You ever seen Murderball in the documentary?  I'm cool with Rick's racism.  It's fuck cripples.  It's a, it's a, it's a, I love that fucking movie.  It's like a, it's a, it's a hardcore wheelchair or something.  Yeah, it is.  And they smash into each other.  Did you see Shaq fight?  Um, by the way, Shaq, that, his show when he fought, uh, uh, uh, what's his name there?  Oscar De La Hoya?  Look at his fight, dude.  The fight's still going on.  They're like two kids and just hold up a hand right.  Wait, so you're going to fight him in a wheelchair?  You're going to hold back?  No.  And what, are you strapped in? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Wait, because he.  We tried to do the barstool fight.  I'm trying to remember, he's only paralyzed from the waist down because some of the guys  he played with were really fucked up.  One leg kind of works a little bit, but not really.  Right.  I bet you he's so, like, he's so tough, man.  He is really tough.  Because all of, all of his leg toughness has gone to his fucking torso.  But that's not even the main event.  Who was the leader?  Was it the leader of the Crips?  One of those gang leaders was paralyzed, and when there was a problem, they would put  you and him in the backseat of a fucking car, and you'd have to fight him in the backseat. 
[03:32:00]  It was an L.A. gang leader.  That's me and six, I guarantee it right there.  You'd have to fight him in the backseat of a fucking car.  There you go, now you've got to get a fucking car.  That's a tough one.  Dude, I want to see you fight in a wheelchair.  Yeah, well, it's April 3rd.  I want to see you do everything in life in one.  Are you putting it on one?  Yeah.  You win, motherfucker.  I mean...  Wait, but who won that fight, man?  That fight?  Who won?  Don Frye.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Did you see that?  The agent guy's eyes were swollen shut.  Oh, it looked like...  He couldn't see, but he was still punching, so full credit to him. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  It looked like Ricky Rocket.  The main event is Benji Madden versus Ricky Rackman.  I don't know if you know who those guys are.  Oh, yeah.  He's the host of MTV's Headbang as well.  Yeah, that guy's fine.  Benji's from Good Charlotte, right?  Yeah, and they hate each other.  Like, it turned into a thing where...  Because they both want...  They started training, and they were like, hey, man, I heard about this Ellis Mania thing.  And I'm like, you guys want to fight?  Because Benji's a good friend of mine.  And I'm like, I can set you up with a fight.  And then that day, Ricky was in the gym, and he's like, what's this Ellis Mania shit?  I want to get in.  I'm like, how much do you weigh?  165?  Benji, how much do you weigh? 
[03:33:00]  165?  And then within 24 hours, they both fucking hate each other, and they're going to kill  each other.  They're training every day.  Their Twitter's like, I just ran fucking five miles.  I just ran fucking ten miles.  They're out of their fucking minds, and they want to kill each other.  And that's the main event.  And that's a real fight.  That's not a joke fight.  That's where they really fight.  Because there's always...  Ellis Mania has one real fight.  How much shape is Ricky Rackman?  He looked like a skinny little metal dude back in the day.  He trains every day, but my money's on Benji.  Of course.  Benji will kick his ass.  Murder ball is wheelchair rugby. 
[03:33:30]  That's right.  Those fucking guys.  But then there's this Master Blaster.  We've got a Master Blaster fight where a guy duct tape your wrist together and your  ankles together.  And you are one person with three arms and three legs and two heads, and you fight the  other guy.  But we work...  Because I have this other Ellis Mania laboratory.  So every Friday I do it.  I'm fucking jealous.  I've got to be honest with you.  This Ellis Mania thing is a great idea.  I know.  I want to go to the other fucker.  I do a live show.  Huh?  In the stadium?  It's in Vegas at the Hard Rock.  When is it? 
[03:34:00]  April 3rd.  In that Hard Rock hotel?  That room.  That big room?  In the joint.  Well, we did...  We did our thing there.  Yeah, done shows there.  Yeah, but the Master Blaster thing, if you're two tough guys, because I do this Ellis Mania  laboratory, so it's like we do research to make fights for Ellis Mania.  It's like an internet TV show that's really shitty.  That's fucking hilarious.  It's just two guys trying to figure it out.  So we worked on it the other day, and I can fight, and a fan duct taped himself to me,  and then another guy who can fight duct taped himself to another fan. 
[03:34:30]  So there's two dudes who can fight, and two dudes that can't, and we stood opposite to  each other, so the good guy's fighting my shit guy, and I'm fighting my shit guy.  So I'm trying to...  Because if you've got your hands duct taped together, and you go to punch, and the other  guy doesn't know that you go to punch, then you fucking try to punch, and your arm doesn't  do anything, and you just stick your head out to get fucking smacked.  So this guy, I know.  It's like the piss his pants guy from Gladiator.  I'm standing...  When they fucking chain it together.  Is that on TV at all?  Yeah, Ellis Mania.  I'm standing there watching, and this other guy, the other boxer guy's really good, he's 
[03:35:00]  a good kickboxer, starts beating the fuck out of my other half, and I'm just standing  there watching the dude get...  Because, you know, I'm moving out of the way, I can fight a bit of a bit.  Dude gets the shit beat out of me.  Do you put Ellis Mania, like, five, will that be online?  Yeah.  No, the whole...  Yeah.  Is this going?  Yeah, live on Ellis Mania.com.  Well, fuck.  I think a lot of people are going to check that out.  Jason, the video of this thing you're describing, I've got to see this shit.  Look under Master Blaster, click on Master Blaster. 
[03:35:30]  Jesus, that's hilarious.  What the fuck is Master Blaster on there?  Well, that's what we call it.  I don't know why.  I smoke weed sometimes.  Sorry.  I thought it was a hilarious name at the time, obviously.  It's kind of a, you know...  It's a catchy name?  I kind of like the name.  Road Warrior.  Fuck it.  You've got to put your fucking...  What are you paying, motherfuckers?  You know what?  You've got to fucking throw in black people at the windows.  Sam is the worst motherfucker online.  He's awful.  Danny's the guy that usually does it, and Danny's the best.  Sam, why don't you put your username and password in there?  What's wrong with you? 
[03:36:00]  I don't have an username and password.  Why don't you fucking get one, you fuck...  Oh, no, you're broke.  You don't...  You guys keep all the money.  You don't give him any, right?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck him.  I don't pay him either.  He's terrible.  I got bills to pay.  Sam spends all his money on hormone treatments.  Dude, I just got your password.  I just got your password.  Sweet.  I'll be checking this shit out later.  You're a fucking asshole.  Fucking millionaires over here.  You're just fucking saving five bucks a month.  I didn't think we became the one ever.  I'm going to remember that.  Right, so...  What is this?  This is the research and development. 
[03:36:30]  The guy with the orange t-shirt, he's a professional fighter.  So we're testing it.  Oh, so if you guys both punch at the same time...  Okay.  I thought those arms were dead.  We're just warming up, and then we're like,  you know what?  Fuck it.  Let's just go.  And as soon as we start going,  this guy in the orange, look at it.  He can move his head, and he's fighting.  This guy can't fight.  He's never fought in his life.  I get kicked in the nuts.  I just get kicked in the nuts.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  So that's the other thing.  We're going to kick.  You can kick as well.  Yeah.  So because your feet are duct-taped together,  when you kick, anybody knows anything about MMA, 
[03:37:00]  when you kick, you rotate on the ball of your foot.  Oh, shit.  Because that one's duct-taped together, you can't rotate.  So this guy who's a fan, Scott Green,  who knows nothing about fucking kicking at all,  I kick him in the leg,  and then he just fucking kicks me in the fucking nuts.  Jesus.  There's no leg kick involved at all.  It hit both balls.  Seems like he did know something about kicking.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, there's no ball kicking Aladdin.  I thought the middle arms would be dead.  So you, like, use your right hand,  and your partner uses his left hand as one guy. 
[03:37:30]  You know what I mean?  That would be kind of cool.  If you're bringing him work together,  you can throw kicks and punches together.  I have an advantage.  So game over when he gets knocked out, basically.  Until, there's going to be three one-minute rounds,  and then we'll judge on score.  But yeah, if you knock out your apartment,  and you're, if someone knocks out your partner,  and you're dragging him around while you're still fighting,  I'll let it go.  But I'd say that, you know, I mean, I'll probably stop.  That really fucking looks cool, though.  Yeah, I agree.  I'm still recovering from the ball kick.  But you wait, because this guy,  I don't really know this guy right here,  but he's a famous fighter. 
[03:38:00]  And I could tell when we started to really fight,  I could see the look in his eyes.  Like, oh, he's really trying to fight.  So watch, he actually patches up my buddy right here.  Here we go.  See, he's using his head, he's going down,  and I don't know what.  Oh, yeah.  He's looking for a big one.  He's tagging him.  Yeah, he catches him good in a minute.  Why does he cut the malarkey?  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  Damn, man.  Yeah, he's bobbing and weaving.  Yeah, I was just watching him,  because the other guy that was in front of me can't fight,  so I was just watching.  Oh, fuck.  Your partner looks like a tougher Jimmy.  See, he just got clogged on the side of the head. 
[03:38:30]  He just got clogged on the side of the head.  Well, that's the strategy,  is you try to knock the other.  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  I was waiting for him to punch,  and then I'd cheat and go over there  and try and hit him.  That's the move.  But then when I would do that,  my guy would punch me.  So, look, it's a sweet chess game of,  fucking cheek trying to get me.  He wasn't trying to get you across.  I just think that that would get boring.  I'm not trying to watch it.  No, not at all.  He gets, look at his fucking head moving,  motherfucking way.  He gets overhand rights and uppercuts  start landing in a minute.  Oh, shit.  Here we go.  Oh. 
[03:39:00]  Let it go on.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Two overhand rights and uppercuts.  And he starts losing.  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's fucking moving in his body.  No, your boy is not a pussy, though, man.  He's...  Oh, shit, he's getting fucked.  Yeah, your guy is getting fucked now.  Yeah, I'm just kicking it.  Is that guy punching as hard as he can or no?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it looks like it.  See, the thing is,  with people who know how to fight,  you punch from your feet.  So if your feet are stuck together, 
[03:39:30]  that's why I want these Alice Mania fights to be fun.  You can get a bloody nose,  but I don't want anybody's jaw to get fucking snapped off.  You know what I mean?  So you can throw a punch,  but you can only throw a punch as hard as you can  with your arm and you can't use your body  to get a really good punch going.  You don't want anybody getting Dan Henderson.  God, remember the days without lawyers, Anthony?  You want to tape Kimbo Slice and Dick Clark  and let them two duke it out?  All right, with that, we've got to wrap up.  We're running out of the show.  We have to plug real quick, right? 
[03:40:00]  Patrice has got comics here in New York,  February 25th through 27th,  and Saturday, March 6th,  Trump Taj Mahal here in Jersey, right?  Thanks, Jim.  And I will be in fucking a bunch of places  of Cleveland, February 26th,  and when am I in Wheeze's place?  I think you're doing Wheeze  at the same time as Alice Mania 5.  Rochester.  April, I think the first few days in April, right?  Thank you, Kenny.  Yeah, April 1, 2, 3,  I'm in Rochester, New York,  and I'm in San Francisco.  Is he on the club?  18 through 20.  Yeah, he's got a club now, man. 
[03:40:30]  February.  And Jason, what's the big plug?  Alice Mania 5,  of course you're doing the radio show  every fucking afternoon on Faction.  Yeah, I'm the best dude in the afternoon.  Enough said.  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah, I just want to clarify that  if you are listening to anybody.  Without a fucking doubt.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Have a go, motherfuckers.  What?  Have a go, motherfuckers.  That's just like afternoon.  Anybody in the afternoon have a go.  Rich Rangio!  Yeah!  Rich Rangio!  Fucking Jason.  Hey, thanks for having me on again.  His show isn't bollocks. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, that didn't work out at all.  It ain't bollocks.  Bet you're black.  It ain't bollocks.  It ain't bollocks.  It ain't bollocks.  Yeah.  It ain't bollocks?  No, dude.  You're cunts.  It ain't bollocks.  That's it.  How about this?  Let's get out of here.  He's bringing drugs to Indonesia  and a boogie board.  That's a friend of mine.  Can you believe that?  La Chappelle.  What?  The girl La Chappelle.  She's in jail.  Oh, okay.  There's another guy.  We're out.  We're always doing it.  That's it.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow. </pre>
