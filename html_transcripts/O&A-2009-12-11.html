<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in sexually suggestive banter before abruptly shifting to a discussion of a recent Times Square shooting.  They detailed the events surrounding the death of a man running a CD scam, highlighting the suspect’s rap lyrics boasting about shooting police, the ensuing shootout where his Mac-10 jammed, and the reaction of the suspect's mother.  Relief was expressed that the suspect was killed and no officers were seriously injured, despite one lacking a vest. The suspect’s rap sheet was also mentioned.

The show then transitioned to a humorous, extended debate on the design of 2010 Times Square New Year's Eve glasses, featuring various proposed designs from the hosts and callers, including binary code and Roman numerals.  The hosts even considered creating their own binary-coded glasses.

Next, the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal dominated the conversation, focusing on a $15,000 payment to a high-end prostitute, Laura Dana.  Graphic sexual speculation ensued, alongside comparisons of Dana and Rachel Uchitel's appearances.  The scandal's impact on Woods' career and marriage, including Elin Nordegren's ultimatum, was also discussed.  Studio guest Patrice O'Neal offered commentary on the situation.

An intern competition for the New Year's Eve glasses design was heavily featured.  Three interns, Evan, Graham, and Nick (and later Matt), presented their designs, which were met with extensive critique and mockery from the hosts and callers.  Matt’s design faced particularly harsh criticism due to suspected outside assistance from Troy Kwan, leading to conflict and further vulgar exchanges.  The designs ranged from binary code to a straw structure and a full-face mask.  The hosts also discussed their personal lives, with Opie sharing details about his parents' relationship.  

A significant portion of the show focused on a "homeless shopping spree" segment.  Interviews with two homeless men, Joe and Mustard, who were participating in the spree, were conducted.  They shared their experiences with homelessness, addiction, and personal struggles.  Mustard, who had prior television and music video appearances, performed an original song.  Studio guests Patrice O'Neal and Joe DeRosa contributed commentary and presented their own glasses designs.  Keith the Cop, also present in studio, provided updates on locating homeless individuals for the spree. DeRosa also promoted (and later cancelled) his upcoming CD release party.  

The show also highlighted a segment featuring street musician Mustard, focusing on his music, life on the streets, struggles with depression and alcoholism, and the hosts' offer to fund a CD for him.  A humorous, exaggerated reenactment of a hypothetical studio session with Mustard was performed.  Further discussion included a video of a physical altercation involving a cast member from *Jersey Shore*, triggering a conversation about gender dynamics and violence.

The broadcast also included a segment discussing Barry Bonds' retirement, movie news including *The Princess and the Frog*, the upcoming *Pee-wee's Playhouse* movie, and a rugby film (mistakenly called a soccer movie).  *Avatar*, *Titanic*, and *The Dark Knight* were compared, along with a heated debate about Alfred Hitchcock films, fueled by Joe DeRosa's walkout after the hosts spoiled a movie for him.  The argument involved considerable vulgarity and personal insults among the hosts, Patrice O'Neal, and Joe DeRosa.  The hosts discussed their own work, upcoming appearances (including a Christmas party at FH Riley's), and a "worst of the week" segment.  Plans for a lighter radio schedule the following week were mentioned, along with social media platforms and a call for "Homeless Charlie's" return.  The broadcast concluded with humorous discussions of local news birthday announcements, particularly the name "May Nays."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't thung an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, deviance.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horse shit.  This show is never short of characters.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cookie, cookie, cookie.  Hi, I'm the Opie and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  And here comes your hilarity.  Hilarity.  I'm nice.  I'm nice.  I'm nice.  Oh, my God.  I'm scared of you, sir. 
[00:01:30]  And I'm protecting myself.  Oh, I'm scared.  Yeah, that's a shock up one for the good guys.  That's what happened about three blocks from where we broadcast.  Right?  Three blocks.  Yeah.  I don't want to misrepresent, Anthony.  I was in a hotel.  I was trying to go to sleep. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, barely three blocks.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  It was what?  Close to your hotel yesterday?  Very close.  I heard the commotion.  I'm like, Jesus Christ, what the hell is going on?  It's Times Square.  And I didn't even look out the window.  I'm just like, I was like, yeah.  When you hear sirens and commotion going on in New York City, yeah.  But, dude, it was more commotion than usual.  It was like a lot of different types of commotion.  Does it make you think terrorist attack?  No, no, I assumed something was going on, but I was tired, so I didn't give a shit. 
[00:02:30]  Being a New Yorker, and you stay in New York enough, I don't know, it doesn't bother you as much.  When I was a kid on Long Island and I heard about shootings and stuff, it really freaked you out.  Yeah.  Now?  There was a major shooting three blocks from where we broadcast.  Old school Times Square, yo.  Old school shit.  Yeah.  Guys dead.  Cops came out on top.  Thug dead.  One less piece of shit on the street. 
[00:03:00]  Thank God.  Thank God.  No shenanigans, no lawyers, no bullshit.  Street justice, my friends.  Street justice.  How did it go down then?  That's what this asshole got.  Well, there's a scam going on in Times Square.  Oh, wait, can I start with this?  Front page of the paper, just to set the whole thing up.  Yeah.  Bullets over Broadway.  Yeah, they love writing those clever little...  Bullets over Broadway.  Times Square panic as cops blow away machine gun thug. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  That's the setup.  Thank you.  Yeah, this guy was running this scam that's going on in Times Square.  A lot of rubes down there, you know?  A lot of people come in from out of town and out of state and shit like that, out of country.  And they go to Times Square because that's, you know, that's the place to be.  And these thugs walk around with these rap CDs.  And a lot of times they're just blank CDs, to be honest with you.  They don't even fucking do the right thing and get some shit on there for you?  Nothing.  What they do is they walk up to these rubes and they go, hey, man, what's your name? 
[00:04:00]  And the guy will be like, uh, uh, Bob?  And the guy will write, to Bob, from fucking Gangsta, on the CD, and go, yo, $10.  That's $10.  And hand it to the guy and intimidate him.  Like, yo, man, what's the matter?  You don't like music?  You don't like music?  Yo, man.  And, like, poke the guy with the disc until the rube digs into his pocket, takes out $10, pays this guy for what amounts to a blank CD. 
[00:04:30]  Unbelievable.  Or if he's real lucky, he'll get the thugs, like, shitty rap music.  Where he raps about shooting a cop.  Yeah, exactly.  Which we're going to get into in a minute or two here.  That's what this guy was doing.  Can I, I gotta say this.  Uh, Times Square.  Yeah.  When we were growing up was the greatest place to go if you were a kid from Long Island.  It was scary as shit, but you want to see a circus with the pimps and the hookers and the drug dealers on every, I mean, every corner. 
[00:05:00]  Gang, gang, gang.  Just whispering shit to you as you walk by.  Yeah, you just hear drugs.  You got your fake licenses and all.  I mean, it was just an amazing place.  Yeah, you'd hear, you know, weed, you need weed?  What you need, man?  What you need?  But we're going to give the people a lesson today.  Now, they cleaned up Times Square.  They started that, what, 10 years ago, 11 years ago, somewhere around there.  Giuliani, yeah.  And, man, if you see Times Square today, and most of our listeners probably have.  Yeah.  You know, they do their New York City trip.  It looks like a, it looks like Disneyland, like they say.  It's wonderful.  But we're in the know.  We know a lot of the boys. 
[00:05:30]  Yep.  There's some shit still going on in Times Square.  Major shenanigans going on.  I mean, so, like, this story that we're going to get more into is not a surprise.  And I want the out-of-towners to understand, when you're in Times Square and you think you're in the middle of Disneyland,  it's still a scary fucking place, and you've got to watch yourself.  You've got to be on your guard at all times.  Head on a swivel.  Keep your wits about you.  Don't, don't be afraid of looking like a racist or, you know, that you're going to offend somebody or, you've got to use your common sense. 
[00:06:00]  Sure.  And if somebody's approaching you like this thug.  Yeah.  Just walk the fuck away.  Don't say a word.  And there's cops all over Times Square.  Oh, yeah.  So just walk up to the nearest cop.  Oh, yeah.  You don't even have to bug him.  Just stand there.  The guy won't fuck with you.  You know, there's two movie theaters in Times Square.  Mm-hmm.  One for one gang and one for the other gang.  I'm not even going to name the gangs.  Yeah, I know.  But it's a well-known fact. 
[00:06:30]  If you're part of this one gang, you go to this one theater.  Gang, gang, gang.  And the other gang.  Gang, gang, gang.  Has the other theater.  Yeah.  So it's not completely cleaned up.  We might want that.  If that's the mother.  Is that the mother?  All right.  Yeah, we'll keep that on there.  Yeah, this guy, Ray Martinez, yo.  What did he go by the name of?  That was his name?  Raymond Reddy Martinez.  Yo, Reddy.  His name was Reddy, yo.  And he's got a picture with Reverend Al Sharpton in the picture. 
[00:07:00]  Reverend Al, what a coincidence.  He's got a picture of Reverend Al's holding his CD up in Times Square and smiling.  And this thug is pointing at the disc with his thug face on.  Is that the same CD that has a song in there where this Reddy guy sings about killing a cop?  Well, Martinez raps brazenly about armed confrontation with cops and hustling CDs.  One is called Pray.  He goes, I'm on a mission on Times Square wishing that a cop die before he reach me. 
[00:07:30]  I'll look into that cop's eye before he duck caps.  Better pray for your safety and keep the gun off safety.  He uses safety twice?  Yeah, that's not good.  This guy sucked.  He'd never do that in a rhyme.  The streets done raised me.  Ain't nothing changed.  It's still, fuck you, pay me or else.  Yo.  Fuck.  Fuck, yo. 
[00:08:00]  And then his other one.  In the middle of Times Square.  So multiply that.  These bundles of CDs.  One for ten, two for fifteen, three for twenty.  I sign autograph.  And plus, you take the picture with me.  Forty seconds.  You got forty seconds.  Cop my motherfucker in record.  My motherfucking record.  Yeah, my motherfucking record.  Yeah, they split that up weird.  I hustle hard right in front of virgins or the Marriott.  Cops can't stop us.  This is legal profit. 
[00:08:30]  Well, the cops stopped you.  Sure did.  And right in front of the Marriott that you rap about in that one song.  Yeah, whoops, what happened?  Right in front of the Marriott for the people that might have stayed there across America.  Thank you, Scott from Georgia.  Yo, Ann, that was off the hizzle.  You got off the hizzle.  You ass.  That's funny.  Shit.  For sure.  Well, this gentleman is pulling his scam.  So a couple of New York's finest see him doing this stuff. 
[00:09:00]  He's had warrants out before for doing this.  It's illegal to do this.  What time did this go down?  11 o'clock a.m. yesterday.  Right after our show?  Dude, that's what I was saying.  I was in bed.  I was laying in bed.  I had just gotten to my room.  I didn't know you went right to bed.  I figured you might have got a little breakfast or lunch and it happened later in the day.  I was sleepy, yo.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, it happened like I was.  Dude, that's why I'm not like one of those. 
[00:09:30]  I was there.  I was there.  No, you were there.  I was right the fuck, you know, there.  But I was with Kenny.  He'd have pulled his heat.  He'd have pulled heat on the guy.  If he had heat on me.  Well, I know.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I don't know.  So, yeah, I was.  I might have sat on something once when I got into his car and said, oops, sorry about that, G.H.  His big fat cock.  Well, I think that's what he calls it. 
[00:10:00]  That was.  Did I ever tell that story on the air?  I don't know if you want to be telling that one.  Yeah, probably not.  All right.  Whatever.  I might have sat on something in his car.  Oops, P.H.  Jesus.  So this guy's pulling this scam.  Yeah.  And the cops see him.  And he's wanted and been wanted and been arrested for this before.  It's a hustle.  It's a scam.  And it's illegal.  So the cops go after him and say they were asking for his ID and his tax stamp.  That's how they get these scammers. 
[00:10:30]  They ask him for a tax stamp.  None of them have a tax stamp.  So he turns and runs, runs down seventh, cuts through, starts coming back up Broadway.  The cops tell him to stop.  They say, let me see your hands.  He whips around with.  Now, this is great if you're a gun aficionado.  He whips around with a Mac 10, which was the gangsta gun to have in like the 80s.  Like that's a new Jack City gun. 
[00:11:00]  Really?  That is a fucking, when crack rules New York, the Mac 10 was the fucking gun.  It really goes back that far?  Dude, absolutely.  Wow.  The Mac 10 is a fucking old ass machine pistol that most people just, you barely even see him anymore.  He gets, he's got, I guess, a 30 round mag in there.  He fires about two rounds and the thing jams on him.  I guess ready wasn't ready. 
[00:11:30]  Ready wasn't ready, yo.  You know what happened?  This motherfucker probably had more, more malt liquor spilt in that fucking thing.  You know this piece of shit didn't clean his guns or nothing.  You know?  Don't call him a piece of shit.  His mom is, his mom's is very upset.  Good fucking riddance.  His mom's.  Good riddance.  He, uh, you know he just never, never cleaned it, never did anything, and expects it to work.  It jams up after two rounds.  Uh, the officers then, uh, open fire on him.  Hit him three times. 
[00:12:00]  Once in the, uh, arm.  Once in the collarbone.  And, oops!  Once right in the chest.  Uh, they go over to him and he's still kicking.  He's putting up a fight.  And they're trying to cuff him.  And the guy's fighting.  And, uh, then the guy's brother comes up, jumps on the cop's back, and starts going,  that's my brother, that's my brother.  So they, you know, cuff him too.  Bring him down.  Uh, they wound up letting him loose, you know, after his brother died.  I guess they figured, nah, punishment enough.  Good for you.  Take, take a walk.  So, uh, the mother, um, wants justice. 
[00:12:30]  Well, you know.  Well, it looks like they're friends with Reverend Al, so maybe Reverend Al can get on the case.  Maybe Reverend Al can get on there.  Uh, this might be the quote.  If not, we'll read the one from the paper.  But, apparently, this is the mother.  Oprah Winfrey?  Talking, yeah.  Uh, talking to the news.  Let's, uh, hear this.  That was like, yeah, go ahead.  Was hurt in the incident.  The suspect's mother doesn't understand why police had to use deadly force.  I want to know why that cop did not shoot my son on the leg so he could stop. 
[00:13:00]  Or something, but not in his heart.  Officials say the shooting appears to be within the apartment.  You know why?  Because that's not their job, to shoot in the leg.  They shoot for center mass.  You shoot for the fucking big target.  Especially if the suspect has a MAC-10 and he's already spraying bullets.  Yeah.  He pulls out a MAC-10 and starts shooting.  If that fucking MAC-10 didn't jam, I mean, there would have been 30 bullets all over Times Square.  Exactly.  One bullet flew through the fucking, uh, a gift shop window. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  It hit a wicked book and a Yankee baseball, apparently.  For real?  Yeah.  Collect his items now.  There you go.  Another one hit a marquee of, uh, uh, theater on Broadway that's playing A White Christmas.  God, you really did your research on this one.  Which is ironic.  A White Christmas.  Yeah.  Uh, and, and, yeah, like you said, if that didn't jam, this motherfucker would have just  opened up with a machine pistol on police officers.  One of which, by the way, and no, no, no, was not wearing his vest.  Oh, really? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Which is like, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Now, I think they're, they're, they're running, uh, I'm not sure, but they're running these  scammers, so they might not be in uniform, and it might look obvious if they're wearing  the vest, but I mean, that seems a little, eh.  I got someone very close to my family that, uh, the beat, their beat is Times Square.  I'm going to have to talk to them later today.  Yeah, see what that deal is.  Um, yeah, so the cops, uh, drilled him, geared him, and, uh, no more, no more thug. 
[00:14:30]  One less fucking thug harassing humans, uh, out there in, in Times Square.  And it happened in front of the Marriott?  Yup.  What else is in that area?  I'm just trying to help the people that might have been to Times Square, so they have a  little reference point.  Um.  Is the ESPN zone around that, around there, or is that further down?  I think that's further, uh.  Virgin, MTV Studios, that's all right there, right?  Yeah, that's all right there, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's about where it is.  Forty, what is it, 43rd?  Yeah.  Forty-six, they got him on 46th, on Broadway. 
[00:15:00]  But he ran around a little bit, huh?  Yeah, he went from 44th, around 40, between 44th and 45th, to, uh, 46th Street.  Was the M&M's store right there?  Where they got him.  I think the M&M's store is there.  Oh, Jesus.  It's basically the heart of Times Square.  It is.  It's pretty much where you stand to watch the damn ball drop.  I mean, it's right there.  It is.  All right.  I'm, uh, I, I, I couldn't be happier, though, that, uh, it worked out like it did.  With the, with recent events of, um, of these fucking, I, I, I won't, I won't even call 
[00:15:30]  them people, uh, gunning down police officers.  Uh, it's, it's good to see one go to the, the, the good guys.  Right.  Where this thug, uh, pulls a gun out on the cops and, and gets exactly what, what do you  deserve?  Yeah, I'm with you, man.  Bye, bye.  Completely with you on this.  Bye, fucking bye.  Let's, uh, do the news stories quick just to make sure we got all the facts here.  Sure.  Well, shortly before noon this morning when police say they came into contact with two  men in Times Square running a street scam.  When they confronted them, both men took off after a short chase. 
[00:16:00]  One of them turned around and pulled out this Mac-10 from his pocket.  They say, don't do it, don't do it.  An undercover sergeant fired off four shots, hitting a man sources identify as 25-year-old  Raymond Martinez from the Bronx.  His brother was also with him and is currently in police custody being interviewed by detectives  right now.  Martinez has at least five prior arrests for charges including assault, child endangerment,  trespassing, third evasion, and robbery.  Police say he fired the first shots today.  One went into a gift store, shattering its window. 
[00:16:30]  The other hit the Marriott Hotel.  And that's two bullets.  It could have been 30.  Did you hear his rap sheet?  Like, why the fuck was this guy out on the street?  Why was he out on the street?  Well, so that's, that's a bigger question.  And I don't want to even hear one person talk about guns on, on this issue.  This guy, a fucking criminal who should have been in prison, uh, with a completely illegal  weapon, uh, uh, committing crimes. 
[00:17:00]  The gun didn't do anything.  The gun did a good thing.  It jammed.  Dummy.  The justice system's not really protecting us anymore.  No!  Because time and time again we have these stories where these people should not even be out  on the streets.  What was he doing?  At the, at the end of that report, you'll hear, they, they go through his rap sheet and,  and he's, robbery?  Fucking, what, what's he doing out?  Right.  Second half of the story.  Police say the third bullet from Martinez is MAC-10 jammed, and when you see the clip,  you can understand why that's significant for shooting in Times Square in the middle 
[00:17:30]  of the day on shopping season.  We're lucky that the weapon jammed because he had 27 rounds of ammunition in that clip.  If the weapon hadn't jammed, he potentially could have fired all 27 rounds.  Now, on the body of the man who was shot, police found a business card from a Virginia gun  dealer.  On the back it said, and I'm reading here, I feel sorry for a cop if he thinks I'm  getting into his paddy wagon.  Ah, really?  Well, you're getting into the coroner's fucking truck, dummy. 
[00:18:00]  That's right.  This guy was obsessed with, you know, killing a cop.  Good bye.  Shooting a cop, something.  Good bye.  27 rounds, man.  How long would that take?  Out of that thing?  Mm-hmm.  Pretty fucking fast.  He could have unloaded that in a few seconds.  Yeah.  A couple seconds?  A few seconds.  Somebody would have been shot yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  He got off two rounds, and one went through a gift shop, where the people in the gift  shop said they thought they were being robbed, so they ducked behind the counter and everything. 
[00:18:30]  The hole in the window looks high.  Looks real high.  Really?  Yeah.  He must have been.  You know something?  These motherfuckers don't know how to shoot either, which is great.  More importantly, Brandon from Colorado writes, oh, God, I only hope they didn't damage  the 2010 prototype glasses.  They didn't, right?  They didn't, right?  I hope not.  All right, good.  The 2010 prototype.  You are so wrong on that argument.  No, I'm not.  People were laughing on Twitter yesterday going, the argument you and Ed had about the dumb  glasses was one for the ages. 
[00:19:00]  I still think...  I'm still obsessed with that.  I still think I put in the one.  The 2010 glasses will be lopsided on your face.  Here's the solution.  You figured out the solution overnight?  I saw one.  Wait, for the people that weren't listening yesterday, when you see these Times Square dummies...  On New Year's Eve.  Let's start with the 2000 glasses.  They worked perfectly.  They were centered on your face, and a couple of the zeros, your eyes go through nice.  Like glasses.  And then 2001, nice.  2002, nice. 
[00:19:30]  Because the two zeros are in the middle.  2003, four, five, six, seven, eight.  2009, nice.  Still, you got the two zeros in the middle for your glasses.  Right.  You got a two on one side of your head.  You got the nine on the other.  It's even.  It's perfectly balanced.  Now, 2010.  Fucks it all up.  Oh, shit, yo.  And Anthony says no.  I say no.  2011 will be when these glasses have a problem.  No.  2010.  You can't say that.  The one is going to go over the bridge of your nose.  And the zeros will be over each eye still. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, wait.  But you know what they'll do to keep it from being lopsided?  What?  Add an exclamation point on one side.  Look, there it is.  Oh, you found it even?  Yes.  Is that what they're going to go with, Dan?  I can't wait for New Year's Eve now.  I want to see what the most popular.  See, these are all prototypes, but I want to see what the popular model is going to be.  I was studying prototypes myself, and none of them looked good to me.  I didn't see the exclamation point, though.  See?  See, that looks like we're living in the year 20,101. 
[00:20:30]  I'm not buying the 2010 with the exclamation point, because that looks like the year 20,101.  It does look like way far into the future.  No, that is stupid.  That's not going to work.  The year 20,000.  That's not going to work.  That prototype sucks.  That guy's going to sell two fucking pairs of New Year's Eve glasses.  And I do not like the one with the round hole in the one.  Yeah, I saw most of these prototypes yesterday.  I didn't see the exclamation point. 
[00:21:00]  The exclamation point is so stupid.  That is stupid.  It's so lame.  Back to the drawing board.  You still lose on this argument.  The one gets in the way of everything.  Yeah.  Yeah, the one ruins it.  All right.  Because 2010, you'll see out of the one, zero, but then the other eye will have the one in front of it, which is the center of your eye.  I think they're going to go with the lopsided model.  I think that's the one you're going to see the most of.  What if they poke a little hole in the one?  Well, that's what I was saying.  I saw that one, too.  It looks like shit. 
[00:21:30]  It looks dumb.  It looks like 2000 again.  It looks like you just got shot in the eye by a thug.  You know what it looks like?  It looks like 2000 again.  Because all you see are the circles.  They're fucked.  These glasses have been a moneymaker for the last 10 years.  Now they don't know what to do.  Because 1999.  99 even.  Dude, they used the 99.  Hey, do you have a picture of what 1999 looked like?  Because that could help us.  They used the holes on nine.  They did?  Remember?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  So this really is the first year where it's all fucked up.  And 1988 was the same thing, too. 
[00:22:00]  This is the first year where it's all fucked up.  Yeah.  They don't know what to do with these glasses.  And they sell thousands and thousands of these every year.  1999 New Year's glasses.  Let's see.  Uh-huh.  Oh, no.  That's 2000.  Yeah.  2000 made of these.  Look, 2008.  You're looking right through the middle of those two zeros.  Perfect.  It is perfect.  2010 fucks it all up.  Did these things, like, start in 2000?  But I remember seeing 1999.  And they looked through the little circles in the nine. 
[00:22:30]  I don't remember 1999.  I thought this phenomenon started with, yeah, the millennium.  And now with 2010 coming, they don't know what to do.  The funniest one yesterday was the lopsided one.  The one person said, oh, fuck it.  Just move it to the right a little bit so you can see out of the zeros.  Turn it over.  We'll have a big one going down my nose.  And, yeah, that's, it's going to be interesting to see what the big popular everyone's got them  out there in Times Square glasses. 
[00:23:00]  Because these vendors are not willing to give up on this.  Because this is a big moneymaker.  Every New Year's Eve, dude, when they're just going panning the crowd with the camera  and they're all, woo, woo, you see the roofs and dummies with their fucking stupid glasses on.  I think what they do is they put the year on your forehead now.  Like you were saying, it's now two rows.  Oh, oh, so you're wearing what amounts to fake glasses.  Yep.  And then above them.  Above it will say 2010.  So it's like.  I think that's the only way it could go.  Like a glasses hat.  That's the only way it could go.  But then there's too much shit going on. 
[00:23:30]  The exclamation point sucks.  You're not digging the exclamation point?  I will bet, whoever wants to take this bet, that that one is not the popular one.  Year 20,000, you don't like it?  No.  Year 20,000.  2010 with an exclamation point is the dumbest idea.  But it's even.  Unless they make the exclamation point a different color.  The problem they're doing with these prototypes is making the exclamation point the same color  as the year.  Yeah, but then it looks weird because it's a different color.  And then it's lopsided again.  It's lopsided again color-wise. 
[00:24:00]  Color-wise, sure.  Oh, what a dilemma they are having with these glasses.  It was so easy.  All right, we're going to be on this one.  Oh, we will be on.  Look at the phones and lid.  Everyone else was studying the prototypes last night.  We will be your New Year's Eve glasses radio station.  See, this is why we're discussing this, because of Richard in Florida, because he's like,  no one's going to give a shit.  Richard!  Hey, hey, no one's going to give a shit what these things look like.  I mean, they buy all the old ones looking dorky as hell. 
[00:24:30]  You can't expect to buy these things and expect you're going to get laid wearing them.  We give a shit.  We give a shit.  But you know what?  They're going to be out there.  They will be out there.  We'll be out there in the pool if you're wearing them.  And when we come back after New Year's Eve, after New Year's, we will be on this show going,  ah, so they went with, and then it'll be whatever they went with.  We got the two zeros, so I know they're going to make those the eyes.  Yeah, they have to.  But how do they balance it out on your head?  That's the tough one.  You put the one right in the middle. 
[00:25:00]  I don't know.  Then it's lopsided.  Then it's lopsided.  This is our argument.  Then the stupid two is hanging halfway off your face.  Right.  You're going to bump into people all day.  Yeah, they're going to be hitting twos.  There's not a lot of room in Times Square.  No.  You can't afford to have anything off the side of your head.  There's a big one right in the center, so it looks like a big, giant dick right in  front of your face.  We tried that, too.  It doesn't work.  We don't know how this is going to work.  All right, let's check it out, guys.  Only time will tell.  Right.  Let me say hi to Dennis in Staten Island.  Dennis. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, good morning, guys.  What's happening?  Hey, what's up, brother?  Hey, it's cold.  Hey, hold on.  They just, they even, hold on, hold on.  They even have drawings how the wand fucks it all up.  Yeah, look at that.  What site is that?  It's just Google Images.  If you put in, you know, 2010 glasses, it'll come up in Google Images.  People are really bothered by this.  It says those New Year's glasses makers are going to be screwed unless everyone at the  end of 2009 only has one eye.  And it shows the one eye, and then the other one's covered by the one.  They've been discussing this online for a while.  We just threw this out there as a goof yesterday. 
[00:26:00]  Dude, I've been talking about this since 2000.  You have.  Swear to God.  You could pull a tape of us from 2000, and at some point I was going, they're fucked  in 2010.  All right, let's go to Dennis.  Sorry, Dennis.  Hi, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, listen, you can't have the one going down a center of your nose because it's going  to make all the rubes cross-eyed like wearing an opti-grab.  The opti-grab.  The opti-grab, yes.  You know, there are going to be lawsuits.  Do we have to say that?  Later.  Do we have to say that's from the jerk for some of the people out there? 
[00:26:30]  Maybe.  Opti-grab.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Good morning.  Hey, they're going to make it two columns.  Put the two up top, then the zero, do it vertically, then the one up top, then the zero over the  other eye.  Two columns vertically.  Two columns.  On an angle, though, kind of?  Like two zero.  Oh, I see.  One zero.  And then the two and one up top.  No, then it'll look like 2,100.  All right.  So I'm going to say go to Party Store website there, Danny. 
[00:27:00]  They're already in stores.  What is Party Store selling as far as the glasses go?  All right.  Dennis in Kentucky has the solution.  Dennis.  Yeah.  I got the solution to your glasses problem.  Okay.  Yes.  You put the numbers at a 45-degree angle.  The two's up on your forehead, you look through zero.  One's up on your forehead, you look through the zero.  Yeah, that's sort of what I was just thinking, too, but I don't like it.  I don't know.  It's not.  Still, everything has to be balanced.  It's got to be balanced and centered. 
[00:27:30]  It's centered, right.  Well, you know, it was a thought.  Fletcher now.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff.  Yo, boys.  Hey, listen.  They already have them in Times Square next to the guy that gives away the CDs.  The one is a box number.  So you put two, zero, and the one is bigger.  Two, zero.  A box number.  Oh, you mean it's transparent?  It's a box one.  Oh, okay.  Here it is. 
[00:28:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  That is stupid.  You can't look through all of them.  You can't see.  You can't look through all of them.  I see it.  It looks stupid as hell.  It looks stupid as hell.  I see the box one, but I don't know how that's going to work.  You know how distracting that would be in your eye?  Because you'd be looking through that one, but you'd see the edges of it.  Is that what they're going with?  That's one of them.  All right.  We'll see what the most popular one out there is.  Someone suggests we use Roman numerals. 
[00:28:30]  I don't think that would work.  I'm trying to think.  Would that work?  Let's see.  What is the Roman numeral?  Wouldn't that be like...  MMX.  What?  There would be a lot of X's, right?  It would just be MMX.  MMX.  MMX.  Is that right?  I sucked at Roman numerals.  It's a big X over one I and M.  Why the fuck did we have to learn Roman numerals growing up?  Did you...  Have you used Roman numerals since?  MCLX.  What?  MCLX, really?  Yeah, MMX.  That was right.  It's MMX. 
[00:29:00]  MMX?  Dummy.  Why do you have to learn this shit?  Yeah, MMX.  Let me go to Dr. X.  Dr. X.  Listen, sir.  I'm a dentist.  I deal with this shit all the time.  It's simple.  You start with the numbers, 2, 0, 1, 0, and then you get wacky.  You can't, and it might explain what canting is, the 2 at a slight angle, and then you can't  the opposite, the 0 at the opposite angle.  You can't the 1 at the same angle as that wacky 2, and you can't that 0 back at the other 
[00:29:30]  angle as well.  It's called canting.  Yes, I...  That way the tip of the 1 starts at the eyebrow and leans towards the nose.  Yeah, problem solved.  That's me, you motherfuckers.  I'm a dentist.  I deal with this all the time.  What is he talking about?  I don't know, man.  Let me say hi to Ken.  What's up, Ken?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I think we should just throw the glasses out and go with something easy and do the 2010 
[00:30:00]  monocles.  Oh, a monocle.  Yeah, you're going to be drunk and squinting, so might as well go with that.  You're going to look like a douche with glasses or a monocle, so it's an easy way to go.  Walk around with it in one eye, and you have to hold it with your eye.  It doesn't have like...  It doesn't have ear things.  You've got to hold it like a monocle on a string.  Watching 100,000 people with monocles on on New Year's Eve is going to be classic.  I'm so glad everyone else is bothered by this, because they certainly are. 
[00:30:30]  Thank you, sir.  This has been bugging me for 10 fucking years.  Dennis from Jersey writes, do it in binary, which would be, I think, O, right?  O-B-1-1-1-1-0-1-0-1-0-1-0.  That would be hysterical across your face, like fucking, it's three feet wide, you're  bumping into people.  Is that the binary number for 2010 for real?  I don't even know.  I wouldn't even know. 
[00:31:00]  Lady Trucker needs attention.  Jesus Christ.  Yes, Lady Trucker.  But then it was a tough economic time, so I'll cut the nine off, and then just gangle something  between the zeros to be the one.  Did you get your attention?  I do believe that sucked ass.  All right, here is the glasses for binary.  Yeah.  0-0-1-1-0-0-1-0-0-0-1-1-0-0-0-0-0-1-1-0-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0. 
[00:31:30]  Let's start the worst company ever and start manufacturing those glasses.  Those, those, look, right in the middle, there's fucking a shitload of zeros.  Plenty of them.  There's no way you can't center that.  I want it on one line if we're making these glasses.  Yeah, dang, put that on one line.  Let's see if this works out.  And I want to manufacture these glasses.  Quick, fucking copyright this shit.  We're going binary, yo.  Ted's eyeglass wear.  Oh, look at where all those zeros end up. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, beautiful.  Dude, we got it.  Where's halfway?  Or actually, if you're going to Times Square with a bunch of people, you can have like 10  or 12 people wear the same glasses.  Just standing in a line.  32.  Go back 16.  That would be the center.  Yo, it's perfect.  Perfect.  We're going binary.  We're going binary.  How silly would you look with 32 numbers sticking out fucking five feet off your head? 
[00:32:30]  Could we have one of the interns make one of those?  Yes.  And we'll put the picture online?  Make it.  Because this is our prototype.  Arts and crafts.  I want to thank the binary guy for coming up with this.  This is our prototype for the glasses.  I'm serious.  Get one of the interns to make this immediately.  Holy shit.  Are we going to make a fortune?  And the zeros have to be big enough so you can see through them.  So they've got to be a little bigger than your eyeballs, obviously.  Yeah.  And we want to see what this would look like on someone's face.  All right?  Come on.  Prototype.  Get into the O&A Institute and pump out a prototype immediately. 
[00:33:00]  And whatever intern makes this first gets air time.  Go.  Or how about the...  They'll make the design and then we'll...  Wait.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Bing.  It just hit me.  Okay.  All right.  So we got someone that makes the binary prototype glasses.  Yeah.  But I want the interns who think they're smart to try to come up with a solution as well  for this 2010 thing.  Oh, really?  We want a binary one just for the goof.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  But then we want the interns to come up with their solution for the 2010 glasses.  Okay.  All right?  I bet none of them look good or work or anything.  Well, we'll see.  You got a couple hours to figure it out.  Interns.  Sam's on it.  Sam's talking to the interns.  So...  I love the binary idea.  That would be fantastic to wear.  No one would know what the fuck it is.  A couple of people might.  It'd be the biggest geek in Times Square.  Eric from Salt Lake.  I can't wait till the year 44-44. 
[00:34:00]  There's no fucking way they'll ever figure that one out.  Why?  Four's got a little hole in them.  Not really.  It's all you need.  It's almost an X.  It's perfect.  Well, it's plus signs.  The real problem...  The worst number has got to be one.  Even a two has like a curl at the top.  So you could look through there.  Three, same thing.  Four has a little rough.  Three's rough.  But threes have a curl in them.  A semicircle.  Right. 
[00:34:30]  Four has a hole in it.  Five has that semicircle at the bottom.  Six has a loop.  Seven.  Eight.  Seven's bad.  Seven is bad.  Seven's like a one.  I'd say four's the worst.  No!  Four's got a hole!  But not a big one.  But it's a hole!  Not a big one.  Dude, four is easy.  It's a hole.  You're fine.  Seven and one suck.  Eight's okay.  Nine's okay.  One and seven, blow.  Steve in Florida has a solution. 
[00:35:00]  Steve.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about we do the baseball style?  We do a flip sunglass.  Zero over each eye.  We do one, two as one flip.  One is the other.  As soon as the ball drops and the blinding light hits the crowd, everybody flips their glasses down.  Do you expect a million drunks to figure that out?  Uh-oh, wait.  Big problem.  What happened here?  Our binary conversion was wrong.  What happened, Danny?  I went to the first result that Google gave me for a binary converter.  It's been a while since I've played with binary, so I wasn't about to, you know, question it. 
[00:35:30]  What do you mean what happened?  We're not smart.  But I was alerted by our intern, Evan, that it was incorrect.  And so I subsequently looked at some other binary converters.  And it turns out that first result was indeed incorrect.  Did you now do it a third time?  Yes, I used two.  Oh, we're in trouble.  Here it is.  One, one, one, one, one, zero.  One, one, zero, one, zero.  You want to talk about lopsided.  One, two, three, four, five.  We got five ones on one side. 
[00:36:00]  No, you have to do the zero, one, zero that ends the number across your eye.  So then all that other shit.  All those ones are hanging off your face.  You have five ones hanging off your face.  Or you could do the first two zeros and the two ones in between could go over your nose.  But then you got five ones hanging off one side of your face.  And all that's on the other side is a one and a zero.  Oh, I thought we had it with binary.  I'm sorry.  Oh, now we're in trouble. 
[00:36:30]  Let's just change it.  Maybe we should look at the Israeli calendar.  The Jewish calendar.  Oh, pick like a Chinese New Year or something?  Yeah, maybe it just works better for us.  What, are you going to wear a beaver, an alligator, a snake, and a monkey?  The Year of the Monkey?  Whatever the fuck it is.  Terry in Erie.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Terry.  I'm thinking, go, like, new age, like Jordy LaForge glasses with a 2010 on the forehead.  Jordy LaForge. 
[00:37:00]  Where you wear an air cleaner filter on your head?  Get out of here.  That wouldn't work.  And then you could just spray paint 2010 on the front of it.  It doesn't matter where it ends up.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kevin in Kentucky.  He's got a solution, this Kevin guy.  Kevin.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I've still got 10,000 of those 2009 glasses left.  And what I'll do is I'm having flags made. 
[00:37:30]  I'll put them on a 45-degree angle.  The flag on the right's going to have a hand flipping a bird.  The flag on the left's going to have a plus one.  I've got to get rid of these glasses.  You're screwed.  No one would, no one would, no one would, no one would care.  No one would wear that.  I had 10,002 of them fuckers made.  I gave one away and I lost the pair I was wearing.  All right, you're an asshole.  All right, brother.  I don't know what the fuck's going to happen.  Yep.  Yeah, this is the... 
[00:38:00]  We'll see.  Maybe other...  Are there other kinds of numbers?  We went through that.  Binary and...  I think you have to binary.  Where do you go with this argument?  Roman numerals don't work.  Binary doesn't work.  Oh, man.  So they got that thug in Times Square.  Oh, yeah.  Good.  Yeah, that's what we got.  Bullets Over Broadway.  We were talking about Times Square.  Amazing.  MAC-10.  Amazing.  Get out of here.  You OG.  Just amazing.  No one uses those anymore.  Times Square.  Man, we get one of these.  One a year. 
[00:38:30]  A crowded New York street.  Some lunatic with a gun.  Starts popping.  Buck, buck, yo.  Buck, buck.  All right.  Good riddance.  Everyone's trying to figure this out for us.  I appreciate it, but...  Future going to go...  Oh, all right.  Well, let's say hi to Russ in Kansas City.  Russ.  Russ.  Hey, well, good morning, boys.  Good morning, sir.  Listen, we're supposed to be parked offshore Saturn, you know, so let's make it futuristic.  Put holographic designs on the glasses. 
[00:39:00]  20 on one side, 10 on the other.  Mmm.  I ain't seeing that.  Come on.  We still have...  I don't need to punch after this one.  Come on.  No, we're thinking.  We're actually thinking it over.  We're thinking it's over.  You mean like 20?  Yeah, I understand what he's saying.  Someone has to come up with a solution.  Like one-way hologram sort of thing where you could...  Where looking into the glasses, you could have 20 on one lens and then 10 on the other.  And looking out, you'd just be able to see like regular sunglasses.  And you could see, but it's futuristic, like Doc Brown's glasses. 
[00:39:30]  Oh.  From the future.  You remember the ones that had the eyeballs on them?  Yeah.  You know, where you'd look, you know, straight out.  But now it's just a holographic 2010.  But they'll send away hotcakes.  They're futuristic.  It's the future.  I think you're right.  The problem is these vendors are very cheap.  They want a very cheap glass...  Glass...  Look, see.  ...play glasses made.  Like that.  Now, when you look through that, you see fine.  You see good.  But you could put 20 on one and 10 on the other lens. 
[00:40:00]  That's expensive, man.  Make them square.  Hey, you'd be fucking styling, though, yo.  Your business model would suck.  It won't be that expensive.  You'd be styling.  I mean, I haven't heard a better idea.  I'm going with that.  Better than that fucking binary.  You're right.  Fucking Russ.  Thank you.  Danny fails at binary today.  I don't blame him.  Yeah, neither do I.  Horrible fucking thing.  Binary.  Stop it.  I don't see any binary... 
[00:40:30]  Binary.  I don't see any...  Oh, there's a 1998.  See?  See?  This is what the 99s look like.  Yeah, because...  That's what they look like.  Well, they just made the top of the nine a little bigger.  A little bigger.  So you could see through it.  I get that.  But once again, the one you can't do shit with.  One and seven.  And that's where the problem is.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'm hoping for the holograms.  That's a good idea.  I don't see any.  Do you?  Do you see any hologram 2010 glasses? 
[00:41:00]  Fuck, dude.  I think we're...  Oh, no.  Danny just put it in the search.  No.  No?  No, nothing, right?  Oh.  All right.  We're in.  Okay, after the break, we'll have your Tiger Woods update.  And I really thought we were getting close to the end, but wow.  No, it goes on and on with this poor bastard.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven new Tiger Woods bullet points.  Developments.  Seven developments that we'll get into after the break.  I think that's it for now, right?  Sure.  And other things. 
[00:41:30]  Things.  Oh, the Jersey Shore shit.  Yeah, some stuff's starting to happen, I guess, right?  Yeah, we got a lot of show to do today.  That really made the news.  Your workhorses are here.  Hoping, Anthony, stay there.  God damn, we got a lot going on.  We still love doing radio, by the way.  Love it!  I love it.  Fucking love it.  Homeless shopping spree next Thursday. 
[00:42:00]  We're going to announce the mall on Monday.  And speaking of that, we got Keith the cop, because he's bringing in a homeless friend today, Ant.  Yeah.  Is that happening?  Here's Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Well, I am, I do have a couple guys, but, you know, these subway stations up here are a lot nicer, like, you know, the Rockefeller Center subway station.  Uh-huh.  So, Mustard went in to take a shit in Starbucks about 17 minutes ago.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  He may have pulled a Tupi Tom and passed out in the bathroom, so.  I'm going to have to try and go in there and get him out, because I've been standing out here.  And I have another fellow, too, but he's upstairs in a cab, one of those special cabs that you can't get out of.  So, I know where he, oh, here comes Mustard.  Mustard.  Mustard, yeah.  Why do they call him Mustard?  Honestly, it happens to be his last name.  But he is, he is the heir apparent, if everything worked out to Tupi Tom.  To Tupi Tom, really?  He's the new Tupi Tom, Mustard. 
[00:43:00]  My name, Mustard.  Yeah, he's wandering around Starbucks right now, but I'll be up in a couple minutes.  We're going to make our way through security.  Okay.  All right, very good.  We're going to meet some more of our homeless friends for the homeless shopping spree.  That sounds good.  Mustard.  All right, right on.  Homeless shopping spree next Thursday.  We're doing afternoon drive.  So, you know, if you can, take the day off if you're in the New York area and join us.  We'll announce them all on Monday.  All right?  Another big star.  Mustard.  And who sent this to me?  Holy shit. 
[00:43:30]  I think it was Kevin from Connecticut.  I'm on my Twitter.  Hold on, let me go back to this for one second, Ann.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Kevin from Connecticut just sent me another birthday wish.  These are fantastic.  Another birthday wish.  Could you do it from the beginning, though?  Because it's the funny, kind of the funniest thing is listening to the real ones.  Yeah.  Because it makes the fucking sham ones so much better.  Let's not, did we say who it was?  Who it was about?  No.  Let's not.  Let's see if people could guess and see who it is. 
[00:44:00]  All right, here we go.  Which one doesn't fit?  Another birthday wish from a local news channel.  Is this the same news channel?  Yeah.  No fucking way.  Yes, it is.  All right, let's listen.  All right, here we go.  Time to announce some birthdays.  Happy birthday to Marissa Graven.  Happy birthday wishes from mom, dad, Bradley, grandma, Marlene, grandma, and grandpa Ronnie,  and all your aunts, uncles, and cousins. 
[00:44:30]  Aw.  Happy 21st birthday to Anna Skumakovich.  Birthday wishes from your mom, dad, Stephanie, and Patricia.  An intense birthday to Riley, and second birthday to Maya Slade.  Aw.  Birthday wishes from mom, dad, Tyson, and Simon.  Happy second birthday to Cole.  Birthday wishes from all your family.  And happy birthday to Eric Nagle.  Birthday wishes from Greg, Tony, Lily, Jimmy, Papa John, and May Nays.  Happy 22nd birthday to Albert Lewis.  Birthday wishes from your girl. 
[00:45:00]  Eric Nagle.  Hey, why is that chick laughing?  I think it was because of the last name that the birthday wishes was from.  Yeah.  It sounds like it was from May Nays.  May Nays.  Oh, it was supposed to be May Nays.  It was May Nays.  And before that was Papa John.  Yeah, Papa John.  Papa John and May Nays.  That's why you get your garlic butter song.  Wait, can we hear that again now that I have it?  May Nays.  May Nays.  I didn't know she was.  Okay, so the joke was May Nays. 
[00:45:30]  Let it play a little, because I want to hear if that chick's laughing.  All your family.  And happy birthday to Eric Nagle.  Birthday wishes from Greg, Tony, Lily, Jimmy, Papa John, and May Nays.  Happy 22nd birthday to Albert Lewis.  All right, they're on to it.  Come on, they're on to it.  They're just laughing at it now.  Wait, because they're still laughing when they go to the next name.  May Nays.  And why is there a lot more in this video? 
[00:46:00]  Do they go back to it or something?  Birthday wishes from Greg, Tony, Lily, Jimmy, Papa John, and May Nays.  Happy 22nd birthday to Albert Lewis.  Birthday wishes from your grandma and grandpa and Uncle Al.  Happy 9th birthday to Kaylee Bovee.  Birthday wishes from mom, dad, Nick, and Anna.  Mike Ostrowski is 17 today.  Birthday wishes from your mom, dad, and Andy.  Happy 26th birthday to Paul Summers.  Birthday wishes from Tripp, Bill, Barry, and Chris.  Happy 25th birthday to Stephen Marshall.

And please send us a self-addressed.  Like May Nays?  Self-addressed stamped envelope. 
[00:47:00]  Key word there.  It's now 653.  May Nays?  May Nays?  Hey, the one broad looks like a broad that Tiger would have sex with, huh?  Yeah, where's that?  Look at that.  Oh, look at that.  Let's say hi to Kevin from Connecticut.  Kevin, you sent that one in?  Yeah, as soon as I saw that on Twitter, I had to send it to you.  Yeah.  That is fantastic.  I do want to give credit to one word.  I hate rich cunts on YouTube.  Oh, all right.  Very good.  I'm keeping my eye out for him. 
[00:47:30]  I think it's great.  Yeah, the guy hasn't really come forward.  I mean, a lot of people know who he is.  I kind of like that he hasn't come forward.  No, it's fine.  For now, anyway.  I'll keep them coming.  Funny as shit.  Thank you, Kevin.  See you guys.  All right.  May Nays.  I'll retweet the link for that one.  That's a great one.  I didn't pick up on the May Nays one.  I didn't either.  Because it kind of slipped with the name.  Well, you need to write in the pronunciations on those tough names.  Yeah, they sure do.  May Nays. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  That's sick.  Time for your Tiger Woods update.  Oh.  You know, there is...  Sometimes we have so much stuff and it's hard to organize this shit.  All right.  We'll get into the Jersey Shore stuff later.  Oh, no.  And Chris Brown...  All right.  Let's do Tiger Woods and then we'll figure out the rest of the shit.  Well, first of all, Rachel.  Rachel, I think a lot of people were in agreement was the hottest Tiger Woods whore.  Although Jamie Jungers is right up there.  I liked Jamie Jungers.  That was my favorite Tiger Woods whore. 
[00:48:30]  Well, there's a new broad that came forward overnight.  There's a new kid in town.  Which makes it at least 12.  And this broad blows them all away.  Yeah.  But Tiger Woods had to pay $15,000 for her.  $15,000.  Yeah.  The big headline today is that Tiger paid for sex.  A madam says Tiger paid over $60,000 for including one girl for $15,000. 
[00:49:00]  So it paid over $60,000 for women.  And in one in particular, it cost him $15,000 to be with her.  They said the girl in Manhattan, a petite, pillow-lipped looker.  Yeah, she is a looker.  Absolutely.  Absolutely she is.  Pillow-lipped.  Yeah.  My God, man.  What's her name?  Laura Donna?  Laura Donna? 
[00:49:30]  Laura Dana?  Laura Dana, something like that?  Laura Dana.  Laura Dana, maybe?  Braun.  Yeah.  Nice last name for a girl.  And then this fucking madam was all over TV yesterday just yap, yap, yap, yap, yapping.  With a big, disgusting monster tits.  And madams are fucking disgusting.  Huge over-the-top tits, Botox all over the fucking place.  I hate madams.  Lips filled in.  And she's yapping.  Yap, yap, yap.  Keep your trap shut. 
[00:50:00]  That's why these high-profile celebrities, athletes, they go to the madams  because they're not supposed to be yapping.  Yeah.  And this fucking bitch, Michelle Braun, is yapping all over the place.  Keep it quiet.  Admitting to all sorts of things.  That a couple of the girls that have already been announced before today worked under her  services or whatever.  What the fuck is a chick doing for 15 large, dude?  Please.  Well, we were discussing this.  I don't think she's doing anything more than the fucking Perkins waitress did. 
[00:50:30]  Then what do you, why would you pay?  I think it's on her.  I think it's some kind of like bragging rights.  No, that's not her.  That's not her.  Holy shit.  Who's that?  Who is that?  Oh, really?  Laura Dana.  Oh, that's, is that her?  Is that her as a blonde?  It just says college girls getting, no, she's not pillow-lipped.  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, my Jesus.  It doesn't look like the same one.  Lord fucking, oh, holy my God.  Well, fucking get 15,000, 15 lords together. 
[00:51:00]  Is she available?  I'm sure she's available.  No, this is a different one.  No, that looks like her.  Just as a blonde.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You could Google image this bitch.  Mm-hmm.  15 lords, you get that.  I think it's bragging rights, you know.  Bragging rights?  With yourself and.  For what?  With yourself and others.  Like, ah, you almost collect them.  Look what I got.  I got that.  And it doesn't even matter that it cost you money.  What, like, you, you, holy shit.  You think you would, like, go to your friend and go ahead and check it out. 
[00:51:30]  It's like a hobby, eh?  Check it out.  It's kind of like you, uh, you join a car club.  So you're like, yeah, I drove that.  Yeah, I got that.  Oh, yeah?  I think it's like that with the, with the, with the hookers.  You think?  With the, yeah, the over-the-top hookers, definitely.  Or you're at home while the wife is trying to fucking take care of your kids and you're in  the other room and you, you look at your collection, almost like you're a serial killer.  Wow, yeah, huh?  I, I had that.  Let me look at all the girls I had.  I need to keep trophies. 
[00:52:00]  Right.  I have trophies that I've kept from these girls.  Because I don't, I don't think they're doing anything extra in the bedroom.  I just think that you're just getting a high quality piece of ass.  That's just it.  I can't imagine what they would do in the bedroom to make them worth 15 grand.  What would you need a girl to do for, if you're going to spend 15,000?  That's just it.  I can't even come up with anything that's worth 15,000 for, for like one session of sex.  She would at least, she would at least have to do hiney hole sex. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, that isn't even a, that, I mean, you start there with hiney hole sex.  That's a get right.  You start with the ass.  And then you look around the hotel room to see what you could shove in her after that.  That would be it.  You'd have to be able to make a snuff film with her.  Like $15,000 is ridiculous.  Because once you come, you've got to be going like, oh, shit, man.  You know what I could have done with that $15,000?  $15,000?  I'm not even horny anymore.  Yeah, do women understand what happens to a guy right after he fucking blows his load? 
[00:53:00]  After you blow your load and no chick's worth 15 grand.  It's like, oh, man.  It's crazy.  Oh, fuck.  Damn, I could have just jerked off and saved a $15,000.  All right, hang out.  I'll get your money.  Right.  Fuck.  All I had to do was jerk off and I would have saved 15 G's.  Yeah, before you're just like, oh, my God.  Look at this chick.  $15,000?  Yeah.  Fucking A, yes.  Yeah.  Thank you.  $15,000?  You're so hot. 
[00:53:30]  I want to thank God for that confusion he puts in guys' heads.  Thank you, God.  That makes sense.  Go from, this is completely worth it to, oh, fuck, what did I do?  Within a second.  $15,000.  Within a second.  Is that her?  Jesus Christ.  All right.  I'm starting to second think that $15,000 thing.  Wow.  They're saying that Tiger was really into the college girl look.  Oh, yeah?  Kind of innocent, but hot.  Well, that girl fits the bill. 
[00:54:00]  Except for the Perkins waitress.  If that's her, she could be, she is absolutely the hottest girl on the Tiger list as of yet.  That's what I'm saying.  Which is going to piss off that Rachel broad that keeps wearing those sunglasses because  she has kooky eyes, by the way.  I study this shit.  Kooky eyes?  Yeah.  When you see this Rachel girl without the, you know, the Ray-Bans, which is, you know,  the look that's in right now, she takes those glasses off and she looks almost cross-eyed.  I'm not digging her at all on TV. 
[00:54:30]  There's a couple of still shots of her that are hot.  Yeah, of course.  But on TV?  But she's always wearing the Ray-Bans.  Yeah.  On TV?  Whoa.  She's just a fucking...  Yeah, I agree with you.  Yeah.  So that came out.  Ho Tiger, madam.  He paid for sex with hookers.  $15,000 for one broad.  Oh, yeah.  Tiger and the madam.  It's all over the papers today.  And then you got...  Look at her eye is fucked up.  Yeah.  Huh?  Yeah, I noticed that day one.  She got one fucked up eye.  I noticed that day one. 
[00:55:00]  I'm almost thinking she has a glass eye.  She's got an eye like that fucking serial killer guy.  Maybe it's...  What was his name?  John?  John Lee fucking...  Maybe the one eye is stuck because it has cum in it.  Ah, maybe Tiger jizzed in it.  I'm not...  Because the one eye doesn't open as much as the other eye.  The hell was shot into that eye.  Yeah, that's bad.  He was.  They're all...  He was.  Forrest Whitaker eye.  Yeah.  Yeah, she got Forrest Whitaker eye.  So you got that.  You got the madam saying Tiger paid over $60,000. 
[00:55:30]  That number's got to be way the fuck higher, by the way, because that's one madam.  Oh, yeah.  The son...  And this one madam was saying she got girls for him in...  Fuck, I'm trying to remember all this.  A lot of cities in America.  Australia.  And over there in London.  British...  I think he was getting British Open hookers.  Yeah, well, if he's over there doing the British Open, he needs a release.  $15,000.  The son reports that Elan... 
[00:56:00]  Do we almost have her name right?  Elan.  Elan.  Tiger's wife told Tiger, are you ready for this?  People are just waking up and hearing this for the first time.  Yeah.  Told Tiger to choose between her...  And his whores.  And golf.  And golf.  And Tiger is ready to quit golf.  Golf.  This is preposterous.  This is just completely out of line. 
[00:56:30]  People Magazine says...  How do you say your name?  Every time.  I can't do this one.  Elan.  Elan.  Elan.  Will stay married to Tiger for the sake of the children.  Jack Nicklaus says Tiger's problems are none of his business and the public will forgive him.  Jamie Jungers, the hot blonde...  Yeah.  ...that Anthony really liked before this new one popped.  Yep. 
[00:57:00]  Will appear on the Today Show this morning and Nightline tonight.  Oh, okay.  Today Show.  So we get to see her moving around, not just in still...  Yeah, make sure we get some audio of that, guys.  I want to see it.  And a new mistress hires Gloria Allred, you know, the lawyer that wears the red.  Yes, Allred.  We get it.  Uh, and that will bring the number to 12.  We're up to 12.  Wow.  It was a slow night.  We only gained, uh, one mistress overnight.  It's a slow night. 
[00:57:30]  But we...  By the way, though, we have the official Tiger Woods calendar, though.  There's your 12.  You can make the calendar now.  Let's say hi to Patrice O'Neal.  Patrice.  Hey, good morning.  I was on the way in, but I just wanted to say this prostitute thing.  Yeah.  Um, the theory to me is that Tiger is an asshole, or he's a, he's a brutal, uh, sex guy.  Like, he's, you know, like American Psychic.  He's, like, either a bad tipper, a real asshole, or he, he, he beats him up or something. 
[00:58:00]  That's theory for hookers to start coming out dogging you, man.  Really?  Like, like, if he was really nice, they would leave him alone and not fucking...  Like, that he, that, they just, hookers, high-class hookers just wouldn't risk the rest of their life.  A girl that makes 15 G's to fuck is, uh, I mean, that's the highest of the high.  Like, that's, that's so high, I've never heard of it.  That's like buying a person, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  And, and for her to come out and risk that this, this company that this other madam runs 
[00:58:30]  will snitch on you for buying pussy, which is the, the, the only way a guy like him can cheat anyways.  Uh-huh.  It, it, he must be real, a real fucking asshole, Tiger Woods.  So even in that world, you gotta treat the, the girls right, and if you don't...  You gotta treat them like girlfriends.  If you don't, they're gonna turn around and, and get some payback.  They'll set you up.  When I used to go to Brazil, man, those girls had to like you, man, or you'll be found in 
[00:59:00]  a fucking alley somewhere, dude.  Jesus.  Well, though, just so, uh, everyone knows the full story, this madam's not in the business  anymore, obviously.  She got caught, and she's, uh, doing probation and all that crap, so.  She's, he's a, he's a cocksucker.  Some, I, I, I, just listen to that.  I just wanted to let you know, man, this is, that's egregious for a fucking whore to snitch  you out, man.  Wow.  You know, so, thanks, uh, see you guys in a minute.  All right, Patrice is coming in, but that's, uh, wow, there's a little insight into that 
[00:59:30]  world, huh, eh?  Yeah.  Uh, people are gonna tell us what you get for 15 grand, eh?  Let's go to Tom in Jersey.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, brother.  Hey, you feel you're 15 grand, you don't have to wear a bag.  And we're sure real Jimmy can relate to that.  I'm sure you can get a cheaper hooker and not wear a bag.  Who the fuck wants to live with the fact that you just banged a hooker without a bag?  Hey, I'd be telling everybody.  Jesus, you're, you're a better man than me. 
[01:00:00]  I'd be out of my mind wondering what the fuck this, this whore has.  Uh, let's go to Jimmy James.  Good morning, boys.  What's up, Jimmy James?  Yeah, I heard, uh, for 15 grand, you get to go ass to nostrils.  And, uh, the best part about that is when you bottom out on her brain stem.  You bottom out on her brain stem.  All right.  That's, uh.  Touch it out.  All right, brother.  Uh, let's go to Hank in Connecticut.  Hank. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, brother.  Hey, Hank.  Hey, I'm wondering, uh, is this maybe a superstition of Tiger as an athlete?  You know, Wade Boggs used to have to eat chicken before every game.  Oh, maybe, yeah.  He used to have to eat the screw before every game or every match.  What do you think?  Gotta fuck before a game.  Maybe, uh.  Yeah, but that's supposed to take all the energy out of you.  Tell me it loosens up.  Who said that?  Muhammad Ali or somebody?  Yeah, you lose your legs or something.  You never have sex before the big game.  You want to say.  Maybe he knows something that everybody else doesn't, man.  He's the best golfer in the world.  There you go. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  You know.  Can you imagine Tiger quitting fucking golf?  Let's go to, uh, Ben.  What's up, Ben?  Hey, guys.  Hey, uh, when I was listening to the birthday thing, I could have sworn later on in the  tape there was a Tyler Durden reference.  Yeah, I heard a Tyler Durden reference on that birthday wish as well.  Definitely.  Yeah, good job on noticing that.  I'm going to send that link on Twitter, OP Radio.  Hey, have a good one, guys.  A little bit.  Uh, yeah, see, and I'm telling you.  Yeah.  I think I was on to something. 
[01:01:30]  Scott in Texas is going to back me up a little bit.  Scott.  Love you.  Love the show.  Uh, hey, you know, with that $15,000, you know, you get the new Topps hooker trading  cards to share with your friends.  I think it's like collecting, man.  I'm telling you.  Collect them all?  I don't know.  That's such an odd...  Because these guys get together and they're like, you know what?  Did you have...  Oh, you had her too?  Like, what guys are getting together, though, and saying this?  They're part of that club.  What club?  Well, you don't want to say it, but I mean, these athletes are banging all over the place. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, but you think they're telling each other all that shit?  Like, Tiger was...  Tiger wasn't telling anyone shit.  Really?  He was being an asshole and being very, uh, open about it, but...  He was completely irresponsible.  I bet, uh, half the PGA guys knew exactly what was going on.  And that's why they give those looks like, ugh.  Which golfer came out and said his squeaky clean image and, you know, he fucked up and...  It's the golfer that I can't pronounce his name.  Yeah, there's one guy, though.  Why are you making me do it again?  I have no idea what his name is.  So, we're, uh... 
[01:02:30]  A step ahead of me.  Elin was the nanny for that guy.  Oh.  And then introduced Tiger to Elin, originally.  He was the one bad-mouthing?  He was the one that was, yeah, pretty vocal.  Basically saying he's a piece of shit, and I'm really not happy that I ever introduced  these two.  I thought it was just some other golfer that came out yesterday and said that he, um...  John Daly?  Yeah.  That his squeaky clean image is tarnished, and he's happy about it.  I really don't know.  Pretty much.  Well, because two, uh... 
[01:03:00]  The other bullet point, two PGA pros deny they call Tiger a phony and a fake.  Oh, okay.  So, I don't know.  Maybe it's rumor.  Maybe if someone knows a little more on that.  There's rumor and innuendo.  Uh, yeah, no kidding.  Let's say hi to Jim in Buffalo.  A little golf knowledge right here.  What's up, Jim?  Good morning, boy.  Hey.  Hey.  What about, uh, Phil Mickelson telling him to go with his wife?  Yeah, leave the door.  Go ahead.  Go away.  Yeah, Phil Mickelson right now is at home, keeping his fingers crossed and going, please,  please quit.  Quit the game. 
[01:03:30]  He will immediately win three majors this year if Tiger's out.  And get a shitload of endorsements.  Oh, fuck.  He would be the guy.  You know, most golf fans like Phil over Tiger anyway.  The tournaments I've been at, they fucking love Phil Mickelson over Tiger Woods.  Tigers?  That is a fact.  A bit tarnished these days.  Um, let's go to James the Trucker.  James?  Yeah, good morning.  Good morning, James.  Uh, without us, uh, screwing these girls without a bag, isn't anybody worried about Tiger becoming  the Arthur Ashe of golf? 
[01:04:00]  Ah.  What did he say?  Worried about him becoming the Arthur Ashe of golf.  Yeah, that's crazy, man, taking chances like that.  And without the bag, I mean, you know, they're hinting there could be, you know, a love  child or two out there.  AIDS is gone.  Yeah, they cured that with Tylenol.  Tylenol PM, I believe.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John?  Yeah, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Hey, maybe one of your math wizards could figure this out, but to me, $15,000 to a billionaire  is only like, what, $1.50 to a guy making $100,000? 
[01:04:30]  Mm.  That's, oh, yeah, it's not even about the money.  I mean, to...  I mean, but, you know, to him, what's...  Yeah, to him...  That's nothing.  To him, he laughs at $15,000.  You're absolutely right.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Because she was also saying this, madam, that she would set up Tiger with, like, VIP rooms  and partying and get a bunch of girls to hang with him, and his bill for the weekend or  something like that was $30,000, $40,000.  But that involved partying and everything else, $30,000 or $40,000 a weekend. 
[01:05:00]  What do you do, though?  It's like, you're...  I understand there are plenty of different ways to fuck, but while you're doing it, you  got to just be like, $15,000.  Mm-hmm.  $15,000.  I would be like, jerk me off with your feet.  Go ahead.  Just something.  $15,000.  Guys, something completely different that is retarded.  Go ahead.  I'm just going to try to stick it in your ear.  Not your ear.  In your ear.  Yeah.  I'm just going to...  Look, look, I'm fucking...  I'm trying to fuck the side of your head. 
[01:05:30]  Just to go like, I need something for my money here.  It's unbelievable.  Crazy.  I had a fucking thought about that.  And it'll come back to me.  It is crazy.  What the fuck was I going to say?  Shit.  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.  I'm going to put, like, Alka-Seltzer in a pussy.  And then just fucking...  Like a mad dog.  Like you're fucking a mad dog mouth.  Uh, let's go to Birdman in Glen Cove.  Birdman.  Hey, what would you...  What's happening, guys?  Long time I'm going to speak to you guys.  And listen, how about... 
[01:06:00]  How about...  What would you rather do?  Pay $15,000 or bang the Perkins broad?  Can I start?  And then we'll get Anthony's answer.  Oh, sure.  Perkins broad, without a doubt.  Just less pressure.  Less fucking pressure.  With a rubber or without a rubber?  For a...  Well, with a rubber.  It's a Perkins waitress.  Would you eat it or not?  Would you eat it?  What I...  I don't know.  No.  Tastes like breakfast.  She's probably got some pie down there, no?  Oh, I would...  Some fur...  Some fur...  Fucking fur.  That would taste like bacon.  I would fucking throw up my coffee. 
[01:06:30]  I just puked and swallowed it.  Just thought I was thinking about it.  Yeah, the Perkins waitress, without a doubt, over this...  You've got to see the picture of this girl.  It'd be way too...  I'm looking at her right now.  It'd be way too much pressure.  I would be fucking coming in like 10 seconds.  I would be the one-pump chump.  What would the pressure?  Oh, oh, my God.  And then go, holy shit, I pumped once for $15,000.  $15,000 for your fucking sperm sample.  Right.  Lick you...  She's paying...  I'm paying her $15,000.  She's licking the asshole.  You know that, right?  Right.  And you know...  She ain't going to let you bang her in the ass.  She ain't going to let you do nothing.  She better for $15,000.  I bet you any amount... 
[01:07:00]  I paid $300,000.  They don't even let you do that.  You know what the $15,000 is supposed to be for?  To shut the fuck up money.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  No, you're fucking...  I think that's the way you're going to teach.  Shut the fuck up money.  All you're doing is paying for how hot she is.  Listen, all...  I'm with Birdman.  I don't think you get the ass for $15,000, eh.  This guy doesn't shut the fuck up.  I know, I know.  How about you with shut the fuck up money?  All right.  Thank you, Birdman.  He talks and talks...  Did you hear him talking over...  I kind of liked him, though.  I know.  He had some valid points, but he wouldn't shut the fuck up.  But it's his first time on the show.  $15,000. 
[01:07:30]  He'll learn.  You don't get the ass for $15,000.  You get the fact that she's a really hot broad.  I'm telling you.  What do you get?  Girlfriend experience?  I don't even think she blows you.  How about that?  How about that, Ant?  Fuck that shit.  How about that?  You best be sucking.  She's one of those squeaky clean hoes.  And the Perkins girl, just ass, mouth.  Everything.  Everything.  I don't know, man.  Let's go to Hillary in PA.  Now, Hillary is claiming, Anthony.  Let's see how we do this.  First of all, I'm right, which is nice to hear. 
[01:08:00]  My roommate worked for Michelle Braun, who is the madam that is just yapping all over  the place today, right?  Is that her?  Wow.  Hillary.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  So you got some inside info?  We don't know who you are and if this is true, but what do you got?  Just don't use her name.  No, I won't.  Um, Michelle Braun used to, uh, Nikki's girls.com and you would have to be, um, a member to look  at her website and you'd have to pay like $5,000 a month just to look at the website and 
[01:08:30]  that's how she weeded out cops and all that.  Um, and, um, there was price ranges and you could go anywhere from $30,000 and the girl  got half of that, which would be $15,000 up to $100,000.  What the fuck are you doing with $100,000, girl?  Yeah, can you explain what you get for $100,000 or at least explain what you get for $15,000  because supposedly that's what Tiger paid for one of these girls. 
[01:09:00]  Well, my roommate had, um, a gentleman and, uh, he lived in Florida and we at the time lived  in Manhattan and he would come up and visit her or he would fly her down and it was, she  only saw him, that was her first, um, experience and, um, she was sought after by Michelle because  she had done some internet modeling and stuff and, um, he kicked her out and he flew her  to, um, Florida, took her shopping, took her to dinner, regular sex and oral sex, got never 
[01:09:30]  anything other than that.  At one time she had one of our friends do a threesome with them and that cost them double,  but really nothing, nothing out of the ordinary, I guess.  We're looking at this site and it has like rates for, for hour, uh, like four hours is  like $2,500 and then it goes to two days, three days, four days, one week with this chick  would be $30,000. 
[01:10:00]  Additional hours is, uh, what is that?  $800, $600.  And I don't even think, yeah, I don't even think that Nikki's girl slides up anymore because  Michelle, that got taken down when she got busted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got busted in the end.  Yeah.  But I know my one girlfriend that lives in California, she's done a couple movies, just  like side, um, parts and movies.  Right.  And, um, she was hired by Michelle to go over to the Middle East and she got $100,000 for  a week over in the Middle East.  You have to be like Arab guys. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, well, they're animals.  It's all true.  And you didn't get much for the money, really.  And actually, you had to pay more because you had to pay for the hotel, which had to  be at the plaza.  You have to take them shopping.  You have to go to dinner.  And I mean, she would spend $30,000.  I'm with, uh, I'm with this girl.  I think you just pay for the hotness and that is it.  Let me tell you something.  And I bet you there's not even a, they, they refuse to do anything else.  It doesn't matter how much money you want to pay.  Hey, Hillary, people are saying, you know, a little too much.  I, I do. 
[01:11:00]  Like, like you, you might've been involved in some of these, uh, escort things.  Were you in?  No, unfortunately, I'm not saying I wouldn't have, but I, I just never had the opportunity.  Wow.  Not hot enough.  Not hot enough.  No, I was in nursing school and I wasn't on the internet for her to find me and I wasn't  pursuing it.  How much did your friend make?  Oh, I don't, I mean, in cash, finally, she kind of separated from Michelle and told him,  you know, you're paying her 30 and you're giving me 15. 
[01:11:30]  Why don't you give me the 15?  And then that way you can see me more often.  So then she was making 15,000 twice a month.  Isn't that risky?  Could, I mean, the girl could get in a lot of trouble for doing that.  No, um, well, that, she never had any more dealings with Michelle Braun after that.  Sure.  She burned her brain.  And why, I don't even know if you know the answer, but Patrice brought up a pretty good  point.  Why is this madam talking?  Because it's always been code where the, the madams never talk. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  And she's yapping.  Is she, is she looking for some attention?  Cause most of these women just want attention and be stars.  Or did tiger break some kind of code and got nasty with some of these girls.  So now this is kind of payback.  I disagree with Patrice.  I think that Michelle is probably got some sort of publicity thing out of this because  she's not working anymore.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  She's got nothing to lose.  No one's going to say, Oh wait, I can't call her anymore.  Cause she'll wrap me up.  Right.  She's not working.  So I think she's probably going to come out with some sort of book or she probably already 
[01:12:30]  has one.  Sure.  That's what I think.  All right.  Well, Hillary, thanks for the insight.  Yes.  Thank you.  Have a good day.  You too.  And you want to wake up tiger today or a nice voice.  You want to wake up tiger today?  What is he?  Is he snoozing?  A little Ambien?  He had a little Ambien last night.  He's got a little Ambien and he's got a big day.  He's got to meet with lawyers and talk to his wife some more.  Poor guy.  Maybe some sponsors.  Let's wake up tiger.  Tiger. 
[01:13:00]  Huh?  Huh?  Tiger.  Wake up.  Oh my God.  I just.  Ah.  I'm going to get some new clubs today.  Maybe go out and.  Oh, I need some coffee.  I'm tired.  Why am I so.  Oh my God.  I paid for hookers.  And everybody knows now.  I spent $15,000 on a whore.  Oh my God.  Everyone knows. 
[01:13:30]  Take this Ambien.  Take this Ambien.  I got to relax.  I got to.  Take the Ambien.  Go back to sleep.  Now we got to wake him up.  He's got to talk to the sponsors today.  Try to save some of those deals.  Tiger.  Huh?  Huh?  Go ahead.  Wake up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I'm up.  I'm up.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  What time is it?  How long have I been asleep?  I don't know what this Ambien is.  So relaxing.  Oh God.  My wife wants me to quit golf forever. 
[01:14:00]  I love the game.  It's all I know is golf and fucking.  No, I can't do either.  Holy shit.  I'm screwed.  I thought it was a dream.  Go back to sleep.  Huh?  What?  Tiger.  Oh God.  The light was coming in the window. 
[01:14:30]  Oh.  Oh, I'm so relaxed now.  And I.  Oh, the great Jack Nicholas knows I'm a fucking asshole whore.  Everyone's laughing at me.  Poor guy.  He can't get a night's sleep.  He can't fucking quit golf.  What are you doing?  That's his life is golf.  There's no way he does that. 
[01:15:00]  And his wife wants him to quit the game?  There's some records he really wants to set.  Most majors and all that shit.  And he's going to need all the years he has left to do it.  He hasn't won a major in a while.  His wife is giving an ultimatum.  He'll quit the game.  So what?  He's going to quit the game and then he'll knock up his wife, have a third kid because  that should smooth things over.  Yeah, yeah.  That'll fix everything.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, it'll fix everything.  At that point, when you just go, you know what?  Fuck it.  I'll be single. 
[01:15:30]  I'll win all sorts of tournaments.  And I'll continue fucking my broads.  I think he's very concerned about his image.  I think Tiger is very concerned about his image.  Well, then how the fuck does he get out of this one?  You explain that one to me.  Quit golf.  Really?  Do you see him?  Like I said, you know.  You're not going to see him anytime soon.  At the beginning of this, like I said, he just doesn't pop up on that fucking tee and  go, hey, hey, boys.  Right.  Step aside. 
[01:16:00]  Tiger's here.  Let me drive.  They're trying to figure this out, I'm sure.  And I don't know.  They don't have the answer.  No.  And the sponsors are, they said that Tiger Woods commercials just disappeared from TV.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  With no real announcements or anything.  They just kind of stopped playing the Tiger Woods stuff.  No one wants their product linked to Tiger.  Like, visually, you would sit there and be like, oh, shit, look, it's Caddy.  Right.  Oh, it's Cadillac Escalade, Tiger Woods.  Oh, remember when he crashed the fucking thing in there?  Yeah.  When his wife found out he was cheating?  And someone did a piece yesterday. 
[01:16:30]  It was a montage of all the sponsors.  And their slug lines.  Yeah.  You know, the Nike, just do it.  Oh, yeah.  The Gatorade one was the best.  I don't remember what it says.  It says, uh...  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Yeah, what's the first...  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Dunce.  Can we play that again?  The best part is, I think we got a few good ones in there.  Yeah, yeah.  You were hoping to get one good one.  The Michael Jordan.  What's the first part of that, though? 
[01:17:00]  The slug line is a little longer than, is it in you?  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  No, there's a first part to that, because they said it yesterday.  And then it ends with, is it in you?  So they can't really use that slogan as far as Tiger Woods goes anymore.  Because a lot of women would say, yes, it was in me.  Could you see Tiger just trying to get his fix at, like, a mini putt-putt golf place?  Like, him and his wife.  His wife drags him out, and that's all she lets him do.  Like, he's got to get it through the windmill. 
[01:17:30]  Right, right.  And he's got to wait for some snot-nosed kid to get it in the clown mouth.  Gatorade.  I'm sure this has been said a million times, but it's perfect for fucking Gatorade.  Ah, yeah.  Gatorade's all about replenishing fluids.  Fluids.  Electrolytes.  After you expel them in chick's eyes.  If I was Gatorade, I'd be bragging.  Yeah.  Look at this guy.  It's our product that allowed him to do all this.  Look what he can do.  Sweat on a golf course and bang broads at night. 
[01:18:00]  It was us.  Amazing.  Gatorade.  Fucking amazing.  All right.  Oh, before we go to break, we've got two homeless guys outside for the homeless shopping spree.  That goes down next Thursday.  Indeed.  Do an afternoon drive.  We're not doing it in the morning.  We're doing it in the afternoon.  And we'll announce them all on Monday.  That's the big news for today.  When is that?  What's the date?  The 17th, next Thursday.  Oh.  And O-A-H-S-S on Twitter.  Especially the day of the event.  We're going to be popping video and pictures up there like crazy. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah, yo.  And updates.  So you might want to follow that Twitter account if you have any interest in the homeless shopping spree.  O-A-H-S-S.  Before we go to break, Ant, though, the first prototype 2010 glasses are complete.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Where's Sam?  Here comes Sam.  Sam is there.  Sam is the head of the interns.  Sam is like a Nazi with the interns.  He really is.  Of course he is.  He's very demanding. 
[01:19:00]  We're not ready for the prototype yet.  No, just stay out.  It's Evan.  Of course it's Evan.  We just want to hear from Sam.  Sam, what happened after we said, look, we want the interns to come up with these prototypes?  Well, immediately intern Evan went to work.  Yeah.  Intern Graham was on the phone calling in the breakfast orders.  So he said, I said, did you hear the contest?  And he said, no.  Right.  And I said, you'll have to get the information from your fellow interns.  At which point he asked Evan, who just looked at him, smiled, and walked off. 
[01:19:30]  He would not give him the info.  So less competition, better chance.  Yeah.  These guys are always competing for our love.  We don't even know they exist, which is the brilliance of that.  Especially Evan.  Evan is always ready for a competition.  Is it time for him to leave?  He's been here.  And try to get a job?  How long do you think Evan's been here for?  I would guess four months.  Yeah.  Twelve.  He's been here a year? 
[01:20:00]  He's been here for four.  Swivel hips has been here a year?  Yes.  It was a surprise to me, too, when I see him every day.  Dude, how about this?  Aside from stupid David, I can't name one intern that isn't here now.  And some of them, I don't know what their fucking names are.  I can't name one ex-intern, except for stupid David.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  That's how much they mean to me.  You just heard Cream Pie Jones' feelings.  All right.  Cream Pie Jones.  All right.  What did he do for us?  But I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  Put on a shithat.  I don't remember that.  I don't know Cream Pie Jones' real name.  No, you don't.  I don't know his real name.  But Pat Duffy...  We do remember Pat Duffy.  Yeah, yeah.  But...  We failed.  We wanted to get him hired, and it didn't help me.  We just didn't see it our way.  Intern Ricky.  Who the fuck was Ricky?  I'm trying to remember.  Remember when we sent our intern Ricky out to the Rock and Roll Diner back in 2005, and  we told him that it's the deli with the blue awning?  The awning.  So he was looking for a deli called the Blue Awning for about an hour and a half. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  Okay.  Yeah, he didn't do very well.  All right.  But yeah, I mean, Evan is fiercely competitive against the other interns, and then Graham  came back, because they're still competing over who's going to get the second prototype  done.  It doesn't matter.  We want the best prototype.  Yep.  So even though Evan has come up with the first one, the interns still have, until the end  of the show, to come up with their 2010 prototype fucking New Year's Eve glasses.  First don't mean shit.  Right. 
[01:21:30]  So then Graham came back and was told that he had to get the homeless people breakfast.  And then Graham came to me and said, Sam, can we send somebody else down so I can start  my project?  And said, okay, you can give somebody else the disadvantage.  So he sent Nick down.  But then Nick got underhanded and decided to just assert authority that he didn't have  and just send fat Matt and say, hey, you have to go down and get the homeless people breakfast.  And since Matt's fat, he just said, okay.  And he went down.  That's awesome.  I mean, a lot's going on. 
[01:22:00]  Wow.  Let's get Evan in here.  You want to see the first prototype?  Let's see the first prototype.  And again, the first doesn't mean shit.  It's got to be the best.  We have to deem this the best.  Here is the prototype glasses.  Before you show us, I don't want to put them below the counter.  I want to get into this a little bit.  So you took on the challenge and explain your thought process before you show the glasses.  Well, I went with the binary date.  Okay. 
[01:22:30]  And I just thought the best way to lay it out and I used some drinking cups to cut out the  figures for it and tape it and staple it all together.  All right.  You're going to see the binary.  2010.  Binary.  Well, Evan, how are the type glasses?  How confident are you that you'll be able to beat the other interns?  85% confidence.  85% confidence.  How do you come up with a percentage like that?  85 is a very precise percentage.  Yeah, it really is.  You think yours is going to win?  And you went the binary route? 
[01:23:00]  Well, at first I thought that that's what you wanted.  Ah, we threw you for a loop.  See, we change our minds on this show a lot.  Binary kind of went down the shitter when we realized that there are too many ones hanging  over one side.  And I don't tell the interns if they don't listen.  Speaking of interns, I've got to stop this conversation for a second, because Stephen  S. from Bayshore is reminding us, let's not forget British Bob.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, how are you doing it, boop?  Hey, remember, boop?  Just a kid from Jersey that just, in our eyes, looked like he was from Britain. 
[01:23:30]  He looked like an English kid.  So we refuse to acknowledge him unless he talked as a British boy.  I forgot.  He was one of my favorites.  Boop.  I think it was an idiot.  Sorry.  It was an idiot.  Well, they all are.  Yeah, they are.  Oh, they are.  And mustard is very ready to come in here, isn't it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right, go ahead, Evan.  All right.  And we got Graham outside with his glasses.  Oh, he's got it too?  Wow.  That's exciting.  You ready to see these there?  Yeah, yeah.  This is, of course, the prototype glasses for 2010. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  All right, you look like a complete asshole.  Hold on.  Just looking for that.  I got it.  I got it.  Wait, I can't even.  There's too many ones.  Here, move away from the TV.  Yeah.  This Twitter gets in the way sometimes, huh?  That looks silly.  All right, how many ones you got coming off the side of that?  So you went with the little small ones and the bigger zeros. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Which in turn makes it so, in turn, makes it so, there's not so much crap hanging off  at either side.  Yeah, it's relatively balanced.  And in the final model, it will be perfectly balanced.  Perfectly balanced.  What do you know, Tim?  Wow, okay.  That, for binary, what do you think of?  I kind of got to give it to him.  As far as the binary thing goes, he's got it.  He balanced it out. 
[01:25:00]  I don't like that whole fucking sweeping.  It's like in a crescent moon shape.  There's a lot of ones on the right side of your face.  I used the rims for the cups, so they got a curve to them.  So kind of, this is how it sort of came out.  So it kind of curved.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it really is kind of a loopy rollercoaster look.  But in the final model, it will be straight.  It will be.  Oh, this is just a prototype.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  Once it goes to production.  Well, you know, what do you think?  I think for a binary, which we kind of went, meh, and blew off. 
[01:25:30]  Because if you went into Times Square with that on New Year's Eve, you would just be laughed at.  People would go, what the fuck is that?  You know?  Well, we have a problem with this 2010 business.  Well, that's what we were saying.  That would be a good explanation.  Perfect explanation.  We've got a problem with this 2010 business.  All right.  Very good.  Very good.  Do you want to see Grams?  Of course we do. 
[01:26:00]  That's the first one.  Yeah, let's see Grams.  Here's Evan's 2010 prototype.  Tell him to keep it behind him until he comes in and talks about it.  Yeah.  Years.  Put it on your back.  Of course, the 2010.  We've seen those 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003.  Every New Year's Eve in Times Square.  They're all wearing the glasses.  And 2000, the 1000 is very easy.  Two zeros right there for your eyeballs.  And then the two and the one, two, three, four, five is sticking off the other side of your head. 
[01:26:30]  Now, with 2010 coming up, fuck.  I don't know what to do about that business.  You can't look through a one.  So, uh, uh, the interns have been, uh, given the job of coming up with a prototype of glasses that showed 2010 that you could wear like festive glasses.  There you go.  And now we got Graham in the studio.  Hi, Graham.  Hey, Graham.  What do you think of Evan's, uh, glasses? 
[01:27:00]  And what do you think, uh, uh, about Evan saying that he has an 85% chance of winning this?  First of all, I think Evan's glasses look like absolute shit.  Whoa!  Damn!  No, you didn't.  It's pretty fucking tired and lame.  He just made it out of a cup.  He used his own glasses, which I think is a little messed up.  Because we're supposed to make these glasses, not supposed to use, uh, uh, already existing pair of glasses.  What was this? 
[01:27:30]  To make something.  I'm just talking, uh, creativity-wise.  Creativity-wise.  Now, I did notice you did use your own glasses.  Yeah.  That's unfair because I don't wear glasses, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  That's your problem.  No, that's actually your problem.  You're the one wearing glasses, you myopic fuck.  Whoa!  A myopic joke, Ed.  Jesus.  God damn, they're vicious.  I love it.  Uh, and I just want to, like, uh, do some self-promotion.  I did, uh, I did put the picture of Evan's glasses up on my, uh, Twitter, OP Radio.  So you can check it out. 
[01:28:00]  You best put them all up.  Uh, we will.  The binary solution, I'm calling it.  Yeah.  And Nick's prototype is ready as well?  Oh, this is beautiful.  Wow.  So, Graham, continue.  I'm sorry.  All right.  So what, what, uh, how, what were you inspired by?  What did you, uh, how did you come up with a solution to that goddamn one?  Well, uh, well, this is what I did.  See, I went to get breakfast for, for everybody today.  And I was, uh.  You've got a story, OP.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like a story.  Yeah.  I was waiting there for them to prepare the food.  Uh, and I look over to the counter and I see that there are some straws at the counter. 
[01:28:30]  And I said, you know what?  Straws are, are durable.  Mm-hmm.  You could bend them into various shapes.  True.  One and zero, certainly.  Oh, yeah.  And even a two.  And a two.  I made a two.  Okay.  And, uh, so I took a bunch of straws out, uh, and made a little pair of glasses.  You pay for those straws.  You pay for those straws.  I'm surprised you didn't get that.  No, no, uh.  Fucking savages.  No, they're good down there.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yes. 
[01:29:00]  Are you ready to show us, Graham?  I'm ready.  All right.  Graham's 2010 prototype New Year's Eve glasses.  All right.  I've got to get a picture.  All right.  All right, gentlemen.  Come on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Come on.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get right into the camera.  Ah, shit.  There you go.  Just peer into there.  Um, that is ridiculous. 
[01:29:30]  For the people that aren't going to check this out on Twitter and your, uh, and your thing  over there, Ant, how do we explain this?  I can't even.  It's the worst zeros ever made by a straw.  There's, like, squares.  It's like he tried to.  Not even squares.  They're, like, diamonds.  Dude, this is exactly it.  It's like he tried to draw it with an Etch-A-Sketch.  Right.  There is just, like.  A classic.  Yeah, you can't get those curvy lines or anything.  The second, well, actually, the first zero is a fucking triangle. 
[01:30:00]  Well, it is.  They are lined up where my eyes are.  That's true.  Now, the one is kind of poking down at your nostril.  Yeah.  I don't, I have no excuse for that.  I'm not very good with a craftsmanship.  Well, you know something?  Um.  But the lovely homeless gentleman outside.  Yeah.  With the beard.  Yeah.  He told me that he thought mine was superior to Evan's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mustard.  That would be mustard, I believe. 
[01:30:30]  So, I'm very grateful for that.  Now, what are you supposed to be looking through?  Uh.  The zeros.  I can, uh.  I can see through this one, even though there's some tape in front of it.  Well, you're pointing at the two.  I can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that the two?  Yeah, that's the two.  I can see through the two.  I can see.  Whatever is happening, I can see very well.  See, the problem is you haven't fixed the problem, which is the one is right in front  of your eye.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Now it's lopsided.  Now the two.  This is the problem we had to begin with.  I figure I'm just going to be so drunk on New Year's Eve, I won't be able to see anyway. 
[01:31:00]  Right?  Good.  Good excuse.  Does that really matter?  And which one do you like better?  Um.  Evan's Binary or Graham's 2010 Made Out of Straws?  I, I gotta tell you, I'm leaning toward Graham's.  Okay.  Uh.  Defend yourself.  Man has good taste.  Evan?  I'm just leaning towards it because.  Evan?  I think you did a very poor job and you didn't address any of the problems we were discussing  earlier.  Which are what?  That is the issue.  Which are what? 
[01:31:30]  Where it's all balanced.  A lot lopsided in the balancing.  Yeah.  It's, it's, I mean, I'm sure I could put it over.  You could put it open on just one side and make a pair of glasses.  We want a pair of 2010 glasses that are just balanced on the face.  Yeah, see, what you did, you just, you just made a shitty version of what's available  on, you know, on, on, online where the one is in front of your eye.  Well, I guess I'm not that, uh, much of a virtuoso when it comes to glasses.  I like this kid. 
[01:32:00]  I'm going to, you know, but this is my first entry.  I, I planned, I've got another, uh, trick up my sleeve.  We'll take entries all day long here, so.  We've got a couple more hours if you want to try another pair.  I, I, I want, I want to address something there, uh, uh, swivel hips.  Um, I would like to see you make one that is not binary.  Oh, shit.  I want to see your, I want to see your solution, uh, that is not binary based on just 2010  and see if you'd come up with something better.  All right.  All right.  You want to see Nick's?  Yeah, we want to see Nick's. 
[01:32:30]  Let's see Nick's because, uh, oh, Jesus Christ.  Well, there's a lot of excitement over, uh, this whole bit, Anthony.  Graham.  So, goofy, uh, 1148, Graham looks like an anime character.  Uh, Ed, you want some of the comments on Evans?  Uh, yes, of course.  I'm reading some of the comments on my Twitter here.  Yeah, your Twitter, your piece of the picture.  These glasses have an 85% chance of sucking a big dick.  I think a Remove Your Glasses video is in order. 
[01:33:00]  Steve, of course, Stephen Basher, by the way, on Twitter, for all you Stephen S. fans.  Yes.  Stephen Basher writes, that's binary code for I'm a cunt.  Wow.  FutureDiv.  It's spelled that way.  FutureDiv.  FutureDiv.  He writes, wow, fat asshole, and then a lot of those sucks, and then this guy just says, 
[01:33:30]  fuck that shit, Evan is a faggot.  The picture looks even more ridiculous than you look with them on live.  Yeah.  I must say.  A lot of excitement.  Let me go.  You know what?  That's one of those pictures that pop up as you're looking for something on the internet  and just go, what the fuck is that?  Of course.  Like, you have no idea what it is, why it's on your computer. 
[01:34:00]  By the way, I updated to Uber Twitter, finally.  You want Grams?  CokeLogic.  CokeLogic writes, CokeLogic writes, 2-N-O, question mark?  Like, he doesn't even know what Grams spells out.  It looks like a 2-N-O.  Yeah, 2-N-O.  Yeah, it's, I don't know what it is.  Two triangle.  And then RadioSpringy on Twitter writes, make that shape with your fingers. 
[01:34:30]  It's probably a gang sign, as far as Gram's glasses go.  Your glasses are going to get you shot.  And then, of course, I think the same guy that called Evan a faggot is now calling Gram a faggot.  Fuck that shit, Gram is a faggot.  Wow.  And then Stephen Bayshore writes, those should be removed with a blast of buckshot, I'm just saying.  And with that, we now have Nick in studio with his 2010 prototype New Year's Eve glasses.  Yep.  All right, what's up, Nick?  Walk us through what you were thinking. 
[01:35:00]  Well, obviously.  Yeah, and critique your competition.  Someone's saying that Gram looks like Harry Potter.  You get that a lot?  A little, a little bit, yeah.  Yeah.  And someone here is saying, Gram looks 10 years old.  He does.  Well, obviously, Grams, you could just buy at a store.  Better quality, of course.  I would hope so.  By far.  No lenses.  No nothing.  Like a $15,000 hooker of 2010 glasses. 
[01:35:30]  No.  Of course not.  Evans don't even go with the shape of his head.  They go entirely against it.  They go the opposite way that the glasses, like if you had wraparound glasses, picture  turning them around and putting them on your face so they go away from your face.  It's adding a new element to it.  Yeah, what, antlers?  Look at you.  Yeah, now it's above his head.  All right.  Evans just like, it doesn't even look like anything.  It's just one bar that he just like, he just struck it a couple times.  Yeah, I got you.  It's no good.  Basically, mine, I was thinking, New Year's Eve is obviously a very cold night, so you 
[01:36:00]  want something that maybe might cover your entire face.  This way, you don't get frostbitten on your face.  You don't want that.  But which also leads to an element, people don't know what race you are if your entire  face is covered, which have no fear because I dressed it in my 2010 glasses.  Okay.  And also, there's an element for, obviously, New York is becoming more of like, if you  go to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, it's more of a hipster scene.  Sure.  There's an element for the hipsters there, too. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  He's very confident.  He is.  How confident in a percentage scale are you that you have the better glasses?  Eighty-six.  Eighty-six.  Eighty-six.  Oh, he's doing prizes right rules.  Evan, how do you feel about that?  He just went one percent over.  Yeah, well, we'll see what the outcome is.  I still have another pair of glasses I'm going to fashion.  Evan's sentences are the fucking worst.  I can't stand his sentences.  Now, Nick, what do you think of Evan's glasses and Graham's glasses?  Inferior.  Both of them. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, you're pretty much inferior.  Obviously, Graham, I think Graham had the right idea, but it's already a product that  was made much better.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  But, I mean, Evan's glasses have glasses on them.  Yeah.  It's like reading glasses.  Yes.  Which, I mean, I guess that's okay.  Well, I mean, they're a prototype.  You don't do a lot of reading on New Year's.  It's a little bit of a cop-out.  Prototype.  A little bit of a cop-out.  We understand it's a prototype.  Prototype.  The only reason I chose Graham's is because Evans is so incredibly bad that I chose Graham's, 
[01:37:30]  even though Graham's sucks ass, too.  Yeah, the binary thing might not work.  No one's going to know what binary is.  Right.  Bill Gates doesn't hang out in Times Square on New Year's.  True.  True.  All right, Nick.  All right, so basically, it's a full-face mask for everyone.  Oh, my God.  He's going Mardi Gras.  All right.  It says, wait.  It's written in Roman numerals, which is for the hipster crowd because, you know, they  like obscure things, such as Roman numerals. 
[01:38:00]  It says, fuck 2009 because it's done.  Right.  Then 2010, America.  America.  And kiss my white mouth so you know what race I am.  Wow.  That 2010 rules.  America.  All right.  Just, you know, stare into there a little bit.  All right.  Some of the...  It kind of looks like a Mexican wrestling mask.  Yes, yes.  You look like a superhero.  Which is another element.  Oh, another element.  Superhero look.  Yeah.  Um, why are people just OMG-ing their asses off here? 
[01:38:30]  Well, I mean, very creative, though.  The comments are coming in.  The unknown douche.  Um, all right.  All right.  Now, I'm a little upset with the mask concept over the glasses concept.  I understand what you're doing here.  You can put lenses in them, too. 
[01:39:00]  He's selling it.  He is selling it.  You can put lenses in it.  They come with markers so you can write your own things on them?  Uh, please someone throw a chair at him.  The comments are just coming in.  Uh, like crazy.  Sure.  Well, before you move on entirely, Matt is very angry that he hasn't gotten a chance to show his glasses yet.  Oh, wow.  Matt.  All right.  Um, I...  Um, I'm...  I like the creativity that make the show.  Yeah, I like the creativity and everything, but I gotta sit on that a little while and think about that. 
[01:39:30]  That's fair.  All right.  All right.  Well, because I...  And then I'm just gonna, you know, we'll judge them all as a collection.  You know, and we haven't seen, of course.  I'm sure these glasses are very angry.  Take your stupid mask out of here.  Here's angry Matt.  Come on, guys.  How are you, sir?  I'm doing quite well.  What do you think of Evan's glasses?  You always have a...  Have something to say.  Yeah.  I, I like the originality, but quite honestly, no one's gonna get it. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's a little hard.  That was something we had...  But that is something we brought up when we first said, like, a binary version might work.  And we said, like, no one will understand what it is.  So that's not his fault.  I just want to make fun of Evan.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  What did he do to you?  Wow, he's angry.  Oh, no.  Woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  Now, uh...  All right.  What about Graham's?  What about Graham and Nick while you're at it?  Well, Graham's looks like... 
[01:40:30]  The zeros look like D's and P's.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Fuck.  And Nick's mask is quite original.  I like it.  But it's a glasses contest, not a mask contest.  You know?  It makes a good point.  That's like on American Idol.  That can hurt you, Nick.  That can hurt you.  Yeah, we're here in American Idol where they go, this is, in essence, what this really  is, is a singing competition.  And so all the bells and whistles don't mean shit.  We did say glasses.  We said glasses.  2010 prototype glasses. 
[01:41:00]  And if a mask.  Nick?  There are holes for your eyes and things to go around your ears, which are elements of  glasses.  But that's a mask.  What do your glasses have?  They have things for your eyes and stuff that goes around your ears.  That covers your entire face.  My glasses don't cover my entire face.  Sheesh.  Never mind.  Damn.  Are you going to...  Wow.  You're going to punch him like he got punched?  They're going at it.  Matt's on-air persona.  Not my favorite.  Oh, you shattered my universe.  Nick doesn't love me on air.  I'm going to go cry tonight.  See?  See how annoying this is? 
[01:41:30]  And you know what's...  That's the point.  I love Matt.  I love Matt in the offices.  Great.  He'll do anything.  Like, for anyone.  For instance, I told him that he had to go get breakfast.  He didn't have to.  Right.  But he did.  He's very helpful.  And then he gets on air.  And boy, howdy, does he hate everything.  Boy, howdy.  Get out of the way.  Angry young man.  Okay, Roy Rogers.  You're going to use another antiquated fucking reference?  Oh, wow.  Dude.  Get zooks. 
[01:42:00]  What a persona.  You know?  Gee willikers.  I was actually going to say that.  Well, you didn't.  Yeah, I know.  Good pick up, balder.  Whoa.  Ooh.  Wow.  Wait, what did he say?  Matt was about to tell me that I'm balding.  As if, to notify me since I haven't looked in a mirror in the past two years.  I had no idea.  You're not really balding.  Well, it's pretty bad.  No, you can't see it on this side.  It's pretty bad.  You got a little fucking, what is it, a widow peak or whatever.  No, it's like a mohawk. 
[01:42:30]  It goes to the back of your head, but.  Actually, I was wearing like a hooded sweatshirt once.  And someone was like, oh, like cool mohawk.  I have one too.  I was like, oh, no, it's not.  It's my hair.  How far up does the hairline go on the sides?  On the sides?  Oh, pretty far.  Yeah, pretty far.  I'd say like a quarter.  How's the back holding up?  Oh, the back's fine.  Yeah.  Back's actually pretty good.  So you'll have like the whole, you know.  Yeah, probably, yeah.  Like the front will be gone.  You're hoping, right?  I mean, I'm hoping it stops a little bit.  Yeah.  You don't want the horseshoe.  I want to slow it down a little bit.  You all want to slow it down a little bit. 
[01:43:00]  What?  Do you try any Propecia?  No.  I mean, if it's going to go, it's going to go.  Yeah.  I'll hold on to it for now.  You're one of those guys you're all right with?  Yeah.  Which relative?  What am I supposed to do?  Which relative has no hair?  Actually, they say it comes from your mom's dad, but my mom's adopted, so I have no idea.  Oh, shit.  There's somebody out there you don't even know.  So I could stop here.  I could keep going.  I don't know.  My mom's dad was an alcoholic, and I never met him, so.  Oh, both my parents were, too.  That's how it was made.  By alcoholism?  Yeah.  Nice.  True story.  Nice.  Three months pregnant, they got married. 
[01:43:30]  It was pretty cool.  That's half of America, my friend.  Half of America.  It's very good.  All right, Matt?  The kid's got a story.  I like it.  I like this Nick kid.  Matt?  Well, I decided to go.  Oh, no.  That hasn't been the same joke since I've started here.  Thank you, Danny.  Oh, gee.  What was it?  He's mad at Danny.  Why is he mad at Danny?  What did Danny say?  He looks like a lesbian.  I haven't gotten that same joke since I was 13.  You do look like Chaz Bono.  I love that.  Chaz.  A little bit.  I'm angry Chaz. 
[01:44:00]  Patrice is making a prototype?  Wow.  What?  Everyone's just whipped into a frenzy over this one.  All right.  Go ahead, Matt.  All right, Matt.  So I went to go with the simple and original look, the actual year.  Mm-hmm.  Evan's idea was very original, even though he stole it from ONA.  But I decided to...  A lot of anger.  It's really weird.  I've actually been in a good mood lately.  Yeah.  How can you tell?  Good.  Yeah.  Nice to me.  Goddamn Patrice.  Fucking Marsalis Wallace.  I was fucking dressed for radio today. 
[01:44:30]  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Are you ready to show him off there, Angry Matt?  Yes.  Yes, I am.  All right.  Here he goes.  He is.  It's lopsided again.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's not because...  Explain it.  Because...  All right.  He's got the two zeros over the eyes.  The one is down the bridge of the nose.  The two is hanging over a bit on the side.  But, look, he's got something else that just hangs off and says,  Happy New Year on it.  Come over here.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[01:45:00]  Hold on.  Put it in there.  And then look into that thing there and just...  Yeah.  See?  There it is.  See?  So, it's not lopsided because he does indeed have something hanging off that balances out  the two.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What do you think, Ant?  Oh, really?  I don't like that.  No, no.  His?  Uh, I...  I...  I...  I kind of like it.  Really?  Yeah, it's... 
[01:45:30]  Sometimes simplicity is what it takes.  I mean, when you have the mask and all with all that stuff, the straws, and I don't even  want to deal with your binary fucking shitheads with your concave fucking glasses.  Uh, but that is simplicity.  All he did was take what I believe would be a manila envelope.  Right.  Or something.  A folder.  And, uh, cut it out.  He...  So, he must have, uh...  You sketched it out there.  Well, thanks.  I came up with the concept, and Troy Kwan, Club Soda Kenny's producer, helped sketch it. 
[01:46:00]  Because I...  There's some controversy here.  All right.  All right.  There's some controversy.  You're the kid that gets your father to do all the fucking work for the project.  Right, right.  Mom helps out.  Not essentially.  Number one, I saw this, uh, exact sketch given to Graham before...  Four, he went for breakfast by Troy.  And number two...  Oh, no.  When I asked Matt how his process was doing, he was standing next to Troy, who was doing  the work for him. 
[01:46:30]  Oh.  Could be a disqualification.  Is that true, Matt?  And this is sad, because that is indeed the best, or the better design right now.  But if you did not do the work, uh, how can you come in here and represent...  Why not just go to the store, buy one, come in here and go, here, it's my idea, uh, someone  else sketched it up and put it together and did the...  But I brought it in.  Because I'm poor.  Well, you know my point, you motherfucker.  See, Troy came up with something similar, but I said to raise the one up a little bit 
[01:47:00]  to make it a bit more even.  Is this vanilla ice rule?  Yes.  That little bitty...  That little bitty change makes a lot of difference, Sam.  Hang him by his feet out the window.  Yeah.  Get the trees to fucking hang him out the window.  Uh, and it gives a little bridge of the nose thing.  But the, uh, the bonus element, the happy...  That was not my idea, and I will admit to that.  And that's the key of the concept.  Yes.  That's the whole fucking key to those glasses, is the fact that it's got something to balance 
[01:47:30]  out the two, and that wasn't your idea?  Okay.  I will not deny it.  Disqualified.  I think you gotta be disqualified.  That's fine by me?  Disqualified.  Dick, you are disqualified.  You are disqualified.  You had a bad attitude the whole time.  Yeah, I don't know.  What's up with the bad attitude?  That's weird, man.  It's shocking.  It's very shocking.  You get nothing!  Oh, no.  You lose!  Oh, no.  Good day, sir!  Yeah.  That's a shame.  Yeah.  I'm heartbroken.  Whoa!  You want some of the comments on your design? 
[01:48:00]  You're plagiarized fucking glasses.  Design-wise, this one's better.  That said, Matt's still a cock.  When did Patton Oswalt get in studio?  All right.  Stick those thumbs up your ass, you angry faggot.  Sounds like fun.  Look, Matt's angry.  Grrr, it just says.  And then the same guy calling everyone else a faggot says, fuck that shit, Matt is a faggot.  There you go.  So a bunch of insults about Matt and one compliment on Troy's design. 
[01:48:30]  On Troy's design, right.  And you only got 38 views on your picture.  Oh, wow.  That's low.  Evan and Graham getting, like, over 1,000 already.  Wow.  And Nick is right up there, too.  Okay.  Face.  Face.  Is that it?  Someone has an idea on here, but it still doesn't address the problem.  0-1-0-1-1-0 for January 1st.  No.  But still, in the middle is an 0-1-1, you dummy. 
[01:49:00]  We said that one already, Patrice.  Patrice is going to show us.  We went over this.  Patrice sketched one out.  The two-line thing.  Oh, two-line.  I don't like the two-line.  Yeah, because it looks like 2100 possibly.  It's like 2100.  Well, you know, doesn't work.  We went over that, where the two zeros would be your glasses, obviously, and then the two...  I don't like it.  The two would be a little over your right eye, and the one kind of in the middle.  In the middle, but...  And then the two zeros down below.  It looks like 2100. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  The 2100.  It looks like a son of a bitch.  See, we got everyone thinking, though.  So then who's the winner?  There is no winner, Sam.  They're just four losers.  Everyone's a loser in this competition.  You've all lost.  I'm amazed, though, that they actually did it.  That is what amazes me the most.  They're desperate for attention.  Of course they were going to do it.  Of course they are.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  The lesbian line is worth the whole fucking thing.  Bravo to our interns.  Yes. 
[01:50:00]  They are very diligent, aren't they?  We got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  We got Joe DeRose in studio.  What?  Why not the whole thing right over the top and in the glasses?  That's sort of what we're thinking they're going to do.  That's like a cop-out.  It's like wearing a fucking tiara.  Yeah.  Why not just wear a tiara with glasses?  There's something you can really do with the one.  I know.  That's just it.  That's what we're trying to figure out.  We need the solution.  Wait a minute.  All right, Patrice is still fucking sketching.  We got everyone thinking, though.  I know.  It's a tough one.  They might not be listening to our show anymore, but they're thinking about it.  You know, everybody fucking hung out, skipping. 
[01:50:30]  Like, nothing was ever going to happen during the 2000s.  Everyone was happy with the two zeros in the middle.  Sure.  No one thought about 2010 coming up.  Nope.  And now that it is, now there's trouble.  It's like fucking Y2K all over again.  Where are we going to get these glasses?  Somebody did that one already.  Did they really?  Which one?  Yeah, one intern did that.  Which one?  Oh, with the little two.  See, wait.  We don't need the two.  Can't hang over the side of your head.  It's got to be even.  We want it to be even and balanced.  You know what I mean?  They've got a real dilemma. 
[01:51:00]  And let's take a break.  We'll get these guys on the radio officially after the break.  Oh, and we've got to meet our homeless friends.  They're falling asleep outside.  We've got Mustard and another homeless guy.  Of course they are.  They're going to be doing the homeless shopping spree this coming Thursday, next Thursday.  Yes.  Afternoon drive for us so you can listen to the whole thing live on the radio.  And hopefully a lot of you guys will join us at the mall when these guys shop.  And the mall will be announced on Monday's Opie and Anthony show.  Okay?  Yes.  Quick break.  We'll continue.  Right, back.  All right, I want to acknowledge that this 2010 thing has completely stopped our show. 
[01:51:30]  But everyone's trying to figure out the 2010 New Year's Eve glasses, including Joe DeRosa and Patrice O'Neal.  You've got Janine on Anthony's machine in front of them with her design.  Everyone's throwing in their designs.  It's one.  Wait, Patrice, you've got the solution.  The one goes through.  Patrice.  That's available.  That's available already.  Danny.  It can't be.  Danny, show them the 2010.  Get on mic, Patrice, will you?  Please.  Show them this one. 
[01:52:00]  The 2010 with the eye hole through the one.  That's my shitty design.  But he put another zero on it and made it more fucking complicated.  Joe DeRosa.  Joe DeRosa's designs are the worst, by the way.  Joe DeRosa's designs.  You should be an intern.  You should be with the intern.  What a prick.  And he's just like...  I think I had the best one.  And he's trying to approach it like...  Oh, boy.  And he's being cocky about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You silly earthlings.  Here it is.  Yeah.  Fucking asshole with the...  With the eye keeper.  No. 
[01:52:30]  He had one that looked like it was just 21.  Yeah.  Yeah.  21.  But I put the one through the eye, but you don't...  The one doesn't go all the way through.  It's almost like you don't...  See, look at what's up there.  No.  It's already up there, where you kind of have to still see through the one.  You got to see through the one.  No.  I'm saying that the glasses...  The one...  The top of the one goes on the top of the glass.  Uh-huh.  The bottom of the one goes on the bottom.  You emphasize the one only on the top and the bottom of the zero.  Yeah, I got you.  Of the glasses. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  We got you.  But that's not my design.  That's not my fucking design.  I know.  That's a decent design.  No.  And a lot of people...  Gosh, that is just pathetic.  That is sad.  A lot of people out there are designing their own prototype, so...  I don't want the hole in the one.  No.  Don't want it.  No.  You can't have...  Then the only way is to put a 2010...  Above the glasses.  Above just a regular glass.  That might have to be the solution.  You know what you could do?  You're wearing a tiara.  That's right.  But you could put...  You could write it on the lens of the glasses.  You could have it...  And you could still see through it. 
[01:53:30]  We thought about the holographic.  But it's too expensive.  These fucking vendors are cheap fucks.  It costs like five cents to make these glasses.  And they're making, what?  Ten dollars a pair or whatever it is.  What would it cost?  You want to keep your cost down.  These guys do.  I got you.  Because there are real solutions if you just see through...  Like you said, the 2010.  Well, you know.  I'm a reasonable man.  I'm a reasonable man.  We got to talk to the homeless guys.  You're getting restless.  Joe DeRozan Studio.  Joe, CD release party? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, man.  Fucking A.  When?  December 21st.  It's my band's CD release party at Ochi's Lounge at Comics in New York.  Come out, man.  I think it's good music.  And I think people will enjoy it.  It's not funny music.  But it's...  Wait, you're doing music?  Yeah.  I've been playing music before I did comedy.  Oh, very cool.  So I'm finally getting a CD out.  But, you know, it's cool.  It's not comedian cock rock or anything.  All right.  December 21st at Comics.  Yeah, at 9 p.m.  Joe DeRozan is banned. 
[01:54:30]  Releasing a CD.  Funeral in the Mirror.  Yes, sir.  Wait, that's the name of your band?  The name of the band's Funeral in the Mirror.  The album's Old Wolf Thoughts.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Okay.  Yeah, definitely, man.  Comics on the 21st to see Joe DeRozan.  Awesome.  And Patrice O'Neill back in studio as well.  And we got Keith the Cop somewhere around here.  Homeless Shopping Spree is next Thursday.  And we got some more homeless friends in studio.  Right, Keith?  Yeah, morning, morning.  Morning.  Yeah, next two contestants for our Homeless Shopping Spree.  Yeah.  A couple of fellas from downtown. 
[01:55:00]  Downtown, eh?  Yeah, we got Joe.  How's up, Joe?  Morning, everyone.  How you doing?  How you doing, sir?  How you doing, Joe?  Pretty good this morning.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's cold out there, though, huh?  Yes.  Son of a...  Last night was one of the coldest ones so far.  Yeah, yeah.  Where'd you sleep last night, Joe?  I had to get up from where I was laying at, actually, and take a walk, you know?  Why?  Walk around.  Yeah.  Too cold.  You freeze.  Yeah.  It's crazy out there.  Well, where did you start the night?  At, um...  Varric and Charleston.  Right on the sidewalk? 
[01:55:30]  Well, it's like a restaurant right there.  Right.  And it's a nice little doorway or whatever, and I lay there.  But it got too cold, and you had to get up and move around.  That's a windy street anyway, so...  Yeah, why are you picking a windy street, then?  Huh?  Why are you picking a windy street?  I don't...  Basically, because it's safe.  You know, I don't really...  Nobody bother me if I have my head turned around or whatever.  You know, I don't...  I just feel safe a little bit anyway, you know?  Right.  I hear you.  How long have you been homeless? 
[01:56:00]  Off and on, I guess, really, like, since 96.  96?  Boy, that's a long time.  And, by the way, that would work, because the two nines...  19...  Anthony.  What?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm just so fixated on the glasses instead of somebody's life, I guess.  Jesus.  96?  13 years?  That's a long-ass time.  Well, that's when it started.  That's what I'm saying.  When I eventually first became homeless, you know?  I've had a room or so since then.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Every so...  What happened?  Like, what was the straw that broke the camel's back and got you out of a home?  Actually, my kid's mom's got tired of me.  Yeah?  Drinking and doing other things and...  What are the other things?  Keep my ass out.  What other things?  Heroin.  Oh, shit.  Heroin.  That'll do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a big other thing.  That is a big other thing.  Yeah, really.  I'm going to pop the pill every once in a while.  That's a good idea.  Heroin or something. 
[01:57:00]  Didn't know we were talking about a horse.  Are you still...  Not right now, no.  I'm not drinking or anything at this moment.  So you're clean.  Yeah.  So you're close to having a home then.  The only thing I have in me is I'm on a medication pack, so that's it.  For the mine?  How'd you get off the hurling?  Methadone at first, then I went to detox.  Damn.  I went to methadone.  Shit.  I got sick off the methadone.  I was like, oh, it made me feel just like if I was doing the heroin. 
[01:57:30]  So I was like, I got to come off of it.  Let me ask you a question.  Either anybody.  Can you...  Can an average motherfucker just end up homeless?  Like, will I be homeless?  Like, I don't feel like I'm crazy.  I don't feel like I'm on...  Mustard is going to explain how that could happen in a second.  Can you just be a regular motherfucker and just be like, I don't have a home and that's it?  It can happen.  You sound like Ice-T.  Yeah.  Who does?  He does.  No, I was thinking it's... 
[01:58:00]  You kind of remind me of the young Red from Shawshank Redemption.  It's a little bit.  Yeah, because you don't...  You just don't...  Like, I don't dismiss homeless people in mental...  Like, I learned about bread from a homeless...  Like, why bread is fattening and just soaks up all the...  From a homeless guy who just was in...  Just...  Motherfucker.  But he was explaining how bread works.  And...  And this guy...  What's your name again, bro?  Joe.  Joe doesn't... 
[01:58:30]  He just sounds...  Like a dude.  He doesn't sound like a fucking character.  He just...  A dude.  A dude that went wrong.  Yeah, and I'm trying to figure out...  Can I fucking just end up in the goddamn streets as a dude?  I know.  You ever think that sometimes?  You're like...  All the time, niggas.  Joe, what was your job when everything started going bad?  Or what was your career?  What were you doing in general?  I worked with...  Basically doing a lot of labor work.  But my last job, I worked at John Roselli's antique store at... 
[01:59:00]  And this was 96?  No, no, no.  This was like a couple years ago.  Just like in 2000.  So you don't have that many gaps in your resume then?  Like from 93 to 2007?  So when people are looking at a resume, if you go get a job...  Yes.  It's not...  Majority of my stuff was off the books.  Except for like John Roselli.  So it was like, you know, if I didn't save no money, I didn't have no money.  What happened with that job?  I didn't hear you.  Sorry, what happened with that job?  Dancing.  He stole some shit. 
[01:59:30]  I didn't know.  Nah.  Stole a Chinese lamp.  Stole it for heroin.  Actually, actually, actually, I walked off.  You just left?  Yeah.  Why?  Because, uh...  I was treating them like dog shit.  No.  They actually treated me real good.  They did?  Yes.  So why'd you walk?  Because I didn't want to do anything stupid.  In terms of what you was having thoughts?  I started drinking and stuff and...  You started doing...  Yeah, but wouldn't the job help you from not drinking?  He started fucking up again.  And they were so nice to him that he knows how he is when he fucks. 
[02:00:00]  So he was actually trying not to burn a bridge.  Before he fucking...  Before he turned into the Hulk.  He left.  The black Bruce Banner.  He was walking...  He came to work.  And he was going to kill an old white bitch that was like,  Excuse me, young Negro.  How much is this fucking brooch?  And he's like,  Who the fuck are you talking to, you white bitch?  I'll kill you in this pool.  I'll choke this shit out of you. 
[02:00:30]  Ask me for another old lamp.  Is that about right, Joe?  Fucking bitch?  Is that about right?  Don't kill a motherfucker.  Patrice nailed it.  So are you ready to go back to work, you think?  Yes.  Soon?  Honestly, I am basically trying to put on a little more weight.  I either have to go in the shelter or something to get the proper rest.  You know, living out here, I mean, I could work, but sleeping out here, whatever, you know,  so that's what I was telling the officer bringing me up here that I have to go inside. 
[02:01:00]  I got to get a roof over my head first.  A fucking shave, a shave, a disdew.  I'm looking at both of them.  And no offense, what's your name, brother?  Mustard.  Mustard, I'm sorry.  We're going to talk to Mustard in a minute.  No offense to Mustard, but...  Joe looks ready to join the workforce.  Joe looks like you can fucking fit him with.  Mustard has the look of a dude that...  Would kill you.  That just, that left for some reason.  Not saying he look bad, though.  I'm saying, as I'm looking at Joe and I'm looking at Mustard, fucking Mustard looks like he...  What do you want me to do, take my sneakers off? 
[02:01:30]  I'm saying you look, you look like you could just be lined up.  Yeah, you look like you're ready to go.  Yeah.  Uh, little drops in the eyes to get rid of the fucking, you know, the brownness of the white part.  You know what I'm saying?  And this motherfucker don't look like you, he's, I'm sitting here going, this, he's scaring me.  Like, cause I'm like, you know, tippy-tomping him.  You'd be like, okay, there you go.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's, he scares you because you feel like that could happen to you.  Because this motherfucking shit doesn't seem that far from a person.  Joe, how do you make your money on the street? 
[02:02:00]  None of us, none of us, none of us.  Sometimes cans, but basically I dig in the, uh, in the dumpsters for like, uh, aluminum, brass, copper, stuff like that.  Yeah.  And how do you eat?  Uh, buy myself something, go to churches, you know.  Right.  I have, uh, well, I used to carry a list.  I didn't have it, I basically know where, you know, whatever area I'm in on average, like, who's feeding at this time or whatever.  Sure, sure.  You know, I treat myself to, you know, to some food.  Yeah, right on, man. 
[02:02:30]  Wow.  Well, you're going to join the homeless shopping spree.  That's scary.  You're going to get some stuff from us and the listeners next Thursday.  This is the, this is the fucking reason why I like my monster movies to be, like, the motherfuckers just be like Jason and shit.  Like, like, you, you just want your homeless people to be crazy motherfuckers you don't want to know.  Right.  I'm getting all fucking fucked up with Joe right now.  And I'm like, I'm like, you just want to be, like, yeah, crazy guy.  They call it dare before the grace of God. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, fucking, you know.  Like, what the fuck, man.  When you guys went out, when you guys went out, was it just, that was it overnight?  Or was it a slow transition into homelessness?  Or was it just, boom, I had a bed yesterday and now I'm on the sidewalk?  It's gradual and then sudden.  You understand what I mean?  It's gradual and then sudden.  And with that, this is Mustard, by the way.  Does that make sense?  Well, no, explain, please.  Well, well, well, let's start from the beginning, Mustard.  Okay, as he was saying.  What's your story?  I used to be a normal person. 
[02:03:30]  I like starting the story this way.  I used to be a normal person.  I had a beautiful wife.  I had a groovy home in a really nice part of town.  I had a really expensive dog, $2,000.  That fucking dog cost us.  Weren't you in a Metallica video?  I was, indeed, until it sleeps.  I've been on a lot of TV.  This is Eastside Dave from the future.  Yeah.  What do you mean you were in a lot of TV?  What else?  I grew up in Hollywood.  I grew up in Hollywood, California.  I'm working in the industry since I was a little kid.  My first job, my first booking gig, my first working gig was print work for a Broadway catalog. 
[02:04:00]  Some of the stuff we would know you from.  Obviously, a Metallica video.  The Wonder Years is a TV show called The Wonder Years.  There was an episode of that.  I can't remember what it was called.  Soccer.  They play soccer.  They play soccer.  And you were playing soccer.  I'm on the soccer team.  Fred Savage.  He joins the soccer team.  And I'm one of the goobers on the soccer team. 
[02:04:30]  I've done a few music videos.  Is he looking up the Until I Sleeps videos?  Is that what he's doing?  Yeah.  And I got no beard.  I got long hair.  I got hair down to my ass and no beard.  What part did he play in Until It Sleeps?  There's a sequence.  Well, the whole thing is based on Salvador Dali.  Yep.  His interpretation of hell.  And there's a shot where it's Jesus Christ.  He's being held up by the three wise men while a group of people pelt tomatoes at him.  And I'm one of the three wise men. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, okay.  It's me and the old guys.  Jesus Christ.  So Until It Sleeps, this song's what?  Ten years old?  Yeah, about.  So you were still riding high about ten years ago.  Yeah.  You were doing all right.  I was doing all right.  Doing all right.  All right, continue.  Yeah.  Then a bunch of people died on me.  Really?  That happens to all of us.  Yeah, I know.  But that's what a snap.  But that's what somebody said.  The straw that broke the camel's back.  Yeah, yeah.  That was your catalyst.  You know, I had some other shit I could tell you about my childhood.  You want to go through that?  Abuse and sexual and physical abuse. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just know that.  We can go through that if you want.  But whatever.  So the straw that broke the camel's back was a bunch of people died on me, all right  very suddenly, all right in a row.  Wow.  And I got really depressed.  It depressed me.  It depressed the hell out of me.  And I just kind of, everything just kind of fell away.  Everything just kind of fell away.  Really?  I lost the job.  I lost the nice cushy job that I had.  I was making way more money than I should have been doing.  What was the job?  I was selling vitamins over the phone.  Wholesale. 
[02:06:00]  Wait, that was him.  The point is, I'm just sitting there doing nothing, making way more money than I deserve  to be making.  Hold on.  You're right.  There I am.  All the way to the left.  All the way on the left.  With the long red hair, right?  Yeah, that's me.  And the big fucking Pope hat.  Yeah, the big Pope hat.  Jesus Christ.  You're a young guy, right?  I'm 33 years old.  Everybody thinks I'm 50.  I'll be 48 Sunday.  You look good for 48, Joe.  47, yeah.  Black don't crack.  Black don't crack, yeah, right.  That's what they say. 
[02:06:30]  That's what they say.  So, God damn.  So you were selling vitamins over the phone, making a lot of money?  Yeah.  You had the wife?  You had the nice dog?  And I was working periodically in TV and movies.  I've worked both behind and in front of the camera.  Sure.  I've even done craft services.  You know, I've done all sorts of things.  So you've got a hospital band on, too, though.  Oh, yes.  I'm a fall risk.  I think I'm going to call my band Fall Risk.  I've decided.  What is that?  It means fall risk.  Because one of the...  I'm a chronic alcoholic.  In fact, I have some alcohol on me right now. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, no.  You don't.  Oh, yeah.  Don't tell anybody.  Don't tell Keith the cop that.  And sometimes I black out when I fall.  Oh, you'll just black out and fall down?  Yeah.  Shit.  And it's funny, because when I lost everything, I was sober.  You know, it wasn't until I came out in the streets that I started drinking this way.  I went to Washington Square Park one day, and a man named Luter's Massillion, an old man  from Trinidad, who grew up actually in Montauk, Long Island, he hands me a Poland spring bottle 
[02:07:30]  and says, here, vodka.  And it's kind of been really downhill ever since then.  Wow.  You kind of were digging the vodka and...  It's an addiction, you know.  I said, my friend Donnie would say, alcohol is a hell of a drug, man.  It's a hell of a drug.  I see you're not doing well, man.  Hey, white boy.  I know you're calling a white boy, too.  Hey, white boy.  Hey, try this.  This will make you feel better.  That man drinks a gallon a day.  Luter's Massillion.  Luter's, he drinks a gallon of vodka every day.  We call it the 1516. 
[02:08:00]  It's $13.99 with tax.  It's called, it comes to 1516.  I wrote a song about it.  It might be all that you need, the sweet 1516.  He's obsessed.  He's obsessed with his vodka, with Georgie, Georgie, specifically Georgie vodka and Poland  spring bottles.  He drinks nothing else.  He will drink nothing else.  That's not a bad idea.  What, what, what, what's the, what's the drive that keep, either, both you guys, man,  Joe, what's the drive to keep you from just not jumping in front of a garbage truck and 
[02:08:30]  say, fuck it.  This is just, why, not, yeah, why live?  What's the, what's the, because you live, because you think there's, there's always  a future.  Do you see a future?  Yes.  And what's your future like?  What do you want out of the future?  I make music.  Out of all this, this whole story, the end, not the end of the story, the middle of the  story, before I came to New York, um, I started writing music.  I started making music.  Um, so for me, that's what it's about for me right now.  I'm living by music. 
[02:09:00]  I imagine Joe's probably living for his kids more than anything else.  Yeah.  That's what I was getting ready to say.  Yeah.  They give me, uh.  How old are your kids, Jeff?  Uh, 29, 20, and 18.  Well, 19 and 17, but both of they, all our birthdays in December is coming on the 13th.  Yeah, I sent it to 17th, Yousef's the 23rd, and my oldest son, Joseph Jr., his is, uh,  November the 5th.  Wow.  You know, I can honestly say, uh, 29.  I can honestly say I really haven't been, uh, uh. 
[02:09:30]  You don't look like you should have a 29-year-old kid, Joe.  Wow, he's almost 50.  I know, it's amazing.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking Keith, can you, can you go out and find some fucking crazy bums?  Like, can you?  What the hell is you?  You bring these guys, and they're fucking human beings.  Where's one with a fucking arrow through his head from fucking 62?  Yeah, we're talking a little bit.  Last week, those guys.  We want them foaming at the mouth.  Yeah, like the fucking fuckers.  So we don't have any emotions for them. 
[02:10:00]  Well, our liquor man last week was pretty fucking up his rocker.  Those guys last week are crazy.  I don't, get closer to my, Joe.  I don't, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.  It's not anyone, but.  I don't want to sound like I take.  You're not saving any money, and you lose your job.  When companies emerge, it can happen to people.  Oh, damn.  And you guys had nobody around.  I don't mean to sound like I'm taking something for granted, but you guys had nobody around.  Because I've thought about this.  You know, I work in entertainment.  I'm like, homelessness is not that far away if I don't play my cards right.  Especially these days.  But I always say, I always say, well, goddamn, somebody in my family will let me live with them. 
[02:10:30]  Like, you had nobody around you.  Like, you said you had a wife.  She wasn't like, dude, come sleep on the couch, man.  So the next Metallica video comes along.  Huh?  She took off on me.  She split.  She split.  Well, she took off with a woman.  Your kids, man.  Your kids.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What?  What did you say?  I hope you heard that.  She took off with a woman named Sinead.  Your wife left you for a woman?  Yes, sir.  And you're not into that?  You could have had a home, fucking Mustard.  Right, right.  If you just say, hey, baby, do your thing, you should have told me. 
[02:11:00]  Nah, honestly.  Mustard and his bitches, nigga.  There's the sitcom.  I have clothes there.  She stays in Orange, New Jersey.  Why don't you go live with her, man?  I go there, take a shower, eat, whatever.  Then after football games over the weekend, you know, I was actually thinking about going there today because of the coldness last night or whatever, you know.  And, you know, she's very supportive of me, you know.  But I don't know.  I'm not really helping out with the rent, even though she's paying, you know, whether, you know, the kids say, well, whether you hear it or not, she's still got to pay the bills. 
[02:11:30]  So, you know.  What's the evil part, Joe?  What's the what?  What's the evil?  What's the shit?  Because we're getting, you know, we're getting the part of where you go, oh, man.  But what's the shit you go?  We go, man, you motherfucker, Joe.  Like, what'd you do?  Like, what was the bottom?  Tell anybody.  Like, what was the bottom of where motherfuckers would go?  Joe, I think you need to, like, not ever show up, you know. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, I can.  You're knocking when I can get a woman out.  I was at my sister's house.  My aunt come over.  I mean, I can go to my family.  Right.  You know, my mom's passed away.  My pops, you know, he's still living, you know.  But I don't be around them when I'm out in the street or whatever, you know.  So I stay away.  What did you do?  Did you ever, like, hit your wife?  You ever hit your kid?  Like, in a fit of being drunk or whatever.  And same thing to you, muster.  Like, you ever do some shit like you just like, oh, man, I got to keep away from people. 
[02:12:30]  She used to beat me up.  Really?  That was the straw that brought her camel's back.  We were fighting for, like, three days.  Three days straight, okay?  Somebody called the cops.  The cops show up.  In California, they have a law.  If there's a domestic dispute, complaint or whatever, they have to arrest somebody.  Because at some point, sometime a long time ago, they used to just let people walk away and then come back.  And some guy came back and killed his wife.  I didn't know that.  So now it's like, no, they got to arrest somebody.  And it was you or her?  Usually it's the man.  But I had blood all over my face.  So they arrested her.  They arrested her. 
[02:13:00]  She did not like that.  That cunt.  No, whatever.  Mustard had a future.  Yeah, mustard did.  She's a passionate person.  See what happens?  Loving these bitches.  Good for tiger.  She's a very passionate person.  And all the people I've ever loved have been very passionate people.  Mustard, you seem very aware.  Are you going to get your shit back together?  I've got to get my shit together.  Do you want to?  Cut up and, cut up and, shut up and.  Or maybe he's not.  No, that's a song I wrote.  That's a song I wrote.  Got to get my shit together.  I did it on time.  Don't do that, Opie.  Come on, don't do that.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Yeah, that was... 
[02:13:30]  David.  I like that song.  That was better than any song on Joe's CD.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Joe, you played...  Not Joe, I'm sorry.  Mustard, you played guitar?  I played guitar.  Do we have a guitar in this joint?  Yes.  Somebody have a guitar?  Oh, I want to hear him fucking...  Yeah, we've got somebody looking for one.  All right, yeah, we've got a CD.  I've written some really good songs.  I have a CD, but I'm not sure if it works.  Mustard, you have a Facebook, too?  Yes, I have a Facebook and a MySpace.  A homeless guy with a Facebook?  MySpace?  I know homeless people with Blackberries.  He's got a fucking CD, he just said.  I know homeless people with Blackberries, man. 
[02:14:00]  Only in America.  Only in America.  Can I ask Joe something?  Both of you guys, I guess, but mostly Joe.  Is it easier to be homeless?  Easier to be on the streets?  Because we hear that from time to time.  But there's a lot of pressure when you clean your shit up and you've got to have responsibilities  and stuff.  Do you want to be homeless?  It's stressful.  Which way?  Being homeless?  Yeah.  Well, today it has to be stressful.  I walk from the garage to here, and I'm like, Lordy, Lord. 
[02:14:30]  Like, you know, woo.  I know.  I got a bun.  I should get a scarf.  I was doing that, too.  So there's somebody that he lives out there.  Right.  But, like, I would think not being on the grid, at least, gives you an advantage where, I mean,  in the summertime, if you're chilling and this and that, and you're fine.  But you know what?  It can't be.  Living on the street cannot be.  People always say that they'd be like, yeah, it's getting ready to get cold or whatever.  But, like, really living on the street, whether it's hot or cold, really, it's not good for a person. 
[02:15:00]  It must have been.  How do you update your site?  Well, Anthony, speaking of that, I was wrong.  I was wrong.  Dickie Punchcock writes, it's actually filthy Facebook.  Oh, Jesus.  The library.  I go to the library.  Oh, the library.  Yeah, the library.  And the Apple Store is good for certain things, but I like the library.  I go to the library.  You're punching up shit at the Apple Store?  Joe, I still don't understand, though, man.  You got your sister who's got clothes and shit for you. 
[02:15:30]  Why don't you just go stay with her and get a job at a fucking 7-Eleven and get on your feet?  I don't understand why you...  He can snap.  She don't...  Thanks.  She don't feel safe.  I'm really asking.  She don't feel safe.  He's saying she...  He said he don't want to stay there.  He said that.  Because he know...  Wait, let's ask him.  Joe, why don't you want to stay with your wife?  No, his sister.  I mean, his sister.  I'm sorry.  His sister.  His sister.  No, I've stayed there at times, but I just always leave.  She'll... 
[02:16:00]  I'll go out to work with her in the morning.  You know, she works at a college.  And then, you know, from there, I just get on the train at a bus.  And she has expectations.  That's another thing.  She's trying to better him.  When he goes there, she's on his ass like, Joe, what the fuck you doing?  And he's like, man, I just want to take a shower and think about heroin.  He's saying she doesn't do that.  So that's what I'm respectfully asking you.  What's stopping you from just living there with her and saying, you know, I'm ready. 
[02:16:30]  I'm going to get my shit together.  It's 20 degrees.  Is it like...  Is it like...  Are you like a guy, like, in Vietnam?  Are you like Christopher Walken in Deer Hunter, where you're like, I ain't coming back.  Like, I'm fucking staying here.  Is it like at that point where you're just lost in the jungle or, you know?  No.  I'm just walking with us.  Well, what's preventing you from just...  Yeah, there's a restlessness there, Joe.  It looks like you don't feel comfortable just being in the house there and are constantly leaving. 
[02:17:00]  Maybe so.  I mean, you know, maybe because I'm not help providing or whatever.  I feel, you know, like that because I'm not really giving anything, you know, at the time.  Which she don't, you know, she don't, uh, she's very supportive.  Like, is this couch getting uncomfortable?  You need some bottles or some shit on it?  Or are you going to get up and walk away?  It's amazing the relationship you develop with cardboard.  Fuck your name, man.  I'm trying to prepare myself for homelessness, nigga.  I'm sleeping on the floor later.  I like cardboard. 
[02:17:30]  Let's get back to Mustard.  Mustard, where do you sleep every night?  You know, various places.  We find our places.  Um, some of you sleep on the subway, certain doorways, as he was saying.  Um, in the summertime, you know, in July, it's fine.  You can kind of crash anywhere you want.  Any great indoor, during the day places where they don't fuck with you can just, if you find a little stop.  If you're in the library, I love the library.  The library don't fuck with you.  I go to the libraries all the time.  Librarians are assholes, but they don't fuck with you.  Um.  No, I think librarians fuck with, like, crazy homeless guys like you were talking about if they start, you know, going nuts. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, I'm one of those, you know, right now.  Yeah, he's a fucking crazy homeless guy.  I'm lucid right now.  I'm lucid right now, but I've, I've been psych ward.  I've been, I've had my crazy moments.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just seen Keith, because he, he, he, wait a minute, you just seen Keith when, when, when, when, when Mustard got up to come over here.  He's watching Danny like a, and, and, and, and, and, and Keith is like, you, don't let Mustard fool you, motherfucker.  Mustard, yeah, yeah.  Mustard.  He got nervous there, didn't he?  Mustard, let's get into the crazy thing.  What's the craziest thing you did?  Out there on the street. 
[02:18:30]  I bite people.  Oh, that's good.  God damn.  I walk around, I talk to myself.  I walk around, I talk to myself all the time.  Do you have voices that you listen to?  No, I mean, I have conversations with myself and other people who aren't there.  Right.  But I, like, hear, I don't have auditory hallucinations, no.  Okay.  Now.  So why are you talking to yourself?  I don't know who else to talk to.  Makes sense.  Fair enough, nigga.  He's got an answer for everything.  Fair enough.  He's got an answer for everything.  I've got shit to say, motherfucker.  I've got shit to say. 
[02:19:00]  Beat the cop, everyone.  I mean, less than 14 hours ago, he wasn't a pair of handcuffs.  I mean.  Oh, okay.  Why?  What'd you do?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  He was pretty, he was pretty tanked last night.  Yeah.  When we finally ran into him.  Why are the handcuffs?  I was sitting on the street waiting for my friend, who's wife took that picture.  I think he might have been a little belligerent.  A little belligerent.  So he ended up in a pair of handcuffs.  I tend to be belligerent, yes.  Which kind of made my job a little easier.  And you don't mind, Mustard, you don't mind Keith, even though he's arresting you? 
[02:19:30]  Nah.  It's such a weird fucking relationship.  It is.  It really is.  You have no idea.  The relationship I've developed with the 6th Precinct, it freaks me out.  Why?  It freaks me out.  That was such...  The 6th Precinct, my perimeter is 14th Street, Broadway, Houston, 6th Avenue.  That's pretty much, I stay within those, you know, this is really uptown for me right  now.  You ever think about committing a crime?  Like a, you go try to rob a bank, and if you succeed, you got some money. 
[02:20:00]  If you don't, you get 20 years in fucking...  Indoors.  In warmth.  Yeah.  You ever been in prison?  Yeah.  What's in warmth?  What do you mean in warmth?  He's talking about prison.  Oh, no, not...  Yeah, like, you get...  You just do something, and you're just inside for the rest of your fucking life.  Yeah.  Nah.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  Freedom.  I want freedom, motherfuckers.  I'm sorry.  I'm...  You can take it right up, but you can't take it right up.  Freedom.  The word freedom, that's a...  That's a great argument.  I'm sorry. 
[02:20:30]  I'm sorry.  Prison must be fucking horrendous.  If homeless guys are like, no fucking way.  No kidding.  I mean, I just gotta really...  Either one of you guys...  I don't know.  Either one of you guys go...  I don't...  No.  All right, Patrice.  Patrice.  Patrice.  Patrice.  No.  Either one of you guys go underground ever?  You mean, like, subway?  Well, no.  I mean, we hear about the mole people, which fascinates the hell out of us.  Oh, the tunnels?  People that live underground.  Yeah, the tunnel people.  No, I've never been down there.  I don't know.  No?  Is that bullshit, or is that real?  No, I think that's real. 
[02:21:00]  No, this is...  I have seen people walk that way, but I can't really, like, that far off of myself.  Right, right.  I'm pretty sure it's a real thing, though.  I saw a documentary once.  Yeah.  There's a...  They say there's thousands of people living below the streets of New York right now, as  we speak.  In old tunnels that aren't being used anymore, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Mustard's got a guitar in front of him.  You want to play some for us?  Blast us out some tunes.  There's a song I wrote about Salvador Dali and biting people.  15, 16?  Joe, you know his song, 15, 16? 
[02:21:30]  No, but I just heard him say it.  Yeah, it sounds like a song we want to hear, right?  Might be all that I need.  That's not what I'm going to play, though.  All right.  All right.  I'm about to try that trouble, but, but, but, but, and all this sets up in your window. 
[02:22:00]  I'm about to try that trouble, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, and all this sets up in your window.  I'm about to try that trouble, but, but, and all this sets up in your window and see how it's supposed to be.  Trouble, trouble, trouble, I'll met, double bank, bad pads, and contract.  But, look, although we may, it's not like it's the first time I saw a next time. 
[02:22:30]  Won't you remember to forget, to forget?  I'm not the last time we met.  Thank you. 
[02:23:00]  Trouble, trouble, I'm the double, baby, bouncing, colors, bubbly, all over me.  It's not like it's the first time, no, sorry.  Next time, won't you remember to forget, you forget. 
[02:23:30]  I'm about the last time we met.  It's not like it's the first time, no, sorry.  Next time, won't you remember to forget, you forget.  I'm about the last time we met.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:24:00]  You just blew Anthony away, man.  Anthony was looking at me like, what the fuck?  That's fucking good, man.  Remember to forget.  The guy's got a good fucking powerful voice.  Dude, I would fucking listen to that shit all day long.  What the fuck?  That's real good stuff.  Why am I living on the streets, motherfucker?  We're in a wacky world here.  We're in a terrible world, man.  Wacky makes it sound wonderful.  It's a terrible world.  That's a horrible place.  Fucking mustard mayor.  That's a mustard mayor.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:24:30]  Like fucking fall down drunk or whatever, right?  What the fuck?  There's money.  There's cocksuckers making money, right?  Yeah.  With no talent.  Exactly.  And they don't drink.  Right?  Talentless, sober motherfuckers.  He can fall down, but he...  What the fuck?  I might be a fall risk.  But everybody in the fucking 60s was ahead of habit.  This is shocking, man.  People are losing their minds on the phones. 
[02:25:00]  They're like, I will pay $25 for this song if it goes to this guy.  Okay.  Well, I mean, if you join us for the homeless shopping spree next Thursday, you're going  to meet mustard.  I've got 45 cents in my pocket.  I'll take the $25.  You should bring some fucking CDs with you.  I don't got them.  There's a girl, a girl, an NYU student named Tara.  Right.  Or Tara.  Katara.  Like Katara.  Yeah.  Katara.  She does a radio show on the NYU station.  Okay.  She has my music.  Jesus Christ.  She has it.  Mustard, what the F?  She's probably selling it.  Mustard, man.  Make sure she's not selling your fucking music, Mustard. 
[02:25:30]  That is the shit.  You're making a million dollars off of Crazy Mustard's fucking...  Crazy Mustard's fucking great fucking songs.  Did you ever do like a fucking music thing with the case opened up and people toss some  cash in there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I make more money sitting on the street crying.  Are you shitting me?  No.  Than just some fucking talent.  Yeah.  I make more money just sitting on a piece of cardboard crying to myself.  Crying to yourself.  Do you do the fake cry or is it real?  No, it's real.  No, because some of the guys, I mean, you've got to be honest.  No, it's real.  I've got a lot of emotion in me.  And you just kind of just let your emotions get the better of you. 
[02:26:00]  That is a horrible thing.  Passing by a homeless guy and he's crying.  If you don't give money, you're a fucking piece of shit.  By the way, DeRozan just canceled his album release party.  That's why Joe is shutting up.  He was eating a banana and just threw it down real hard.  DeRozan, you're a townless piece of shit.  Piece of shit.  Keith, what do you got?  When we talk about even like guys faking it and shit like that, we had a guy who used 
[02:26:30]  to sit downtown and every day he collected $175.  He sat on the same corner every day, lived in Brooklyn, had a house, had two kids in  college.  That's what he did.  And that was his job.  The same morons.  And it was fake, right?  It was fake.  Every day, the same morons.  And he said, I take $175 six days a week in cash.  Where did he sit?  Where?  Where did he sit?  Pretty close to where you guys hang out downtown. 
[02:27:00]  God.  I don't know how much.  He was making $1,000, maybe a little more in cash a week.  And he had two kids in college.  That's how he put them through.  And he said, the same people come give me money every day.  Now, Mustard, do you do any covers?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Hold on.  What do you want to do?  He'll recognize this.  Okay.  Mustard.  It's a great anthem of my youth.  I think we know this one.  Oh, shit.  I want to hear this music for me. 
[02:27:30]  When you, it falls.  God, look you in the eyes.  You float like a feather.  And your skin will make me cry.  You're just like an angel in this beautiful world. 
[02:28:00]  You're so fucking special.  I wish I was special.  I wish I was special.  I wish I was special.  But I'm a creep.  I'm a widow.  What the hell am I doing here? 
[02:28:30]  When I don't belong here?  I wish I was special.  It's okay.  Yeah, that hurts.  Don't want to have control.  I want a perfect body.  I want me one of those brand new perfect songs.  I said I want you to know that 
[02:29:00]  Well, I'm not right  You're so fucking special  I wish I was special  But I'm a creep  I'm a little  What the hell am I doing here 
[02:29:30]  When I don't belong here  I, I, I, I  I don't belong here  I don't belong here  What the fuck am I doing here  When I don't belong here  I, I, I  Whatever makes you happy 
[02:30:00]  Whatever you want  You're so fucking special  I wish I was special  Jesus monster  What the fuck  Wow  We gotta clean your shit up, man  Now I'm damn depressed  That is the best interpretation I've heard besides Radiohead 
[02:30:30]  You would, you would win  What the fuck  You would absolutely win on Idle American  Yeah  But then you might be actually obligated to be an asshole for ten years or something  Dude  I really wanna do that  That choked me up a little bit  Dude, what the fuck  You should be playing music  It chokes me up too  It chokes me up too  You should be playing every fucking night  Amazing  What are we gonna do here, Mustard?  I don't, when I first came to New York I did  I played some gigs  I played some places  I played some places  Can you stay away from the vodka a little bit to get some shit done?  What about that?  You know, I lost all this shit  I was sober  I was sober 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, we're all  Here, take my money  Here, throw that to him, Patrice  You should spot me  I don't have any can from it  I need some money  Oh, Jesus, Joe  What the fuck  I'm sorry  Mustard, you just collected a nice little fucking bundle  God damn, Joe  Joe, we'll give you money too, trust me  Just, no, we're splitting  We're hitting, okay  No, wait, wait  But Mustard said something in there  I would fucking  I thought that it went bad because of the vodka  He goes, no, I lost this shit before I started drinking  You just got bored?  All this shit happened really more because of depression than anything else  It wasn't until I came to New York that I started the drinking, really 
[02:31:30]  I mean, I had my first drink when I was 10 years old  Don't get me wrong, I've been drinking all my life  Yeah  But when all this shit went down  No, I was pretty much sober  You know, every once in a while  But no  It's not until I hit the streets that I start drinking every day  And drink all the way down here  Like, I drink a liter of vodka every day  A liter of vodka every day  A liter of vodka every day  I see you  And I have to, just to be reasonable  It's about  It's almost coming in  And it's hard  And Anthony's hard 
[02:32:00]  Anthony's got a cry in him  He's got a cry in him  That guy is  No, Anthony was blown away  He's fucking  There's some tears on the fucking way  There's too much talent there  That talent is ridiculous  It's no bullshit, right?  It's just no bullshit  That's the fucking real deal  I mean, a very creative guy, obviously  This mustard  Jesus  Out of all this depression bullshit  That's what came out of it  As I started writing music  I didn't used to do this  Yeah, but your interpretation of that song  Fucking rocked  And he had confidence  Because I'm like, wait  We'll pick the fucking song  He goes, don't worry about it 
[02:32:30]  You'll like  Shut the fucking  Shut the fucking  Shut the fucking DJ  Oh, he shut my ass off  He shut my ass off  I swear to God  If you got shit on iTunes, dude  I would download  The whole fucking CD  People keep telling me  They see me on YouTube  But I haven't seen it  Really?  Yeah, I'm on YouTube somewhere  Has your name been mustard  For a long time?  Well, my name is Daniel Mustard  Daniel Jonathan Mustard  DJ Mustard  DJ Mustard  How retarded is that?  Yeah, I know, I know, right 
[02:33:00]  I'm going to kick my mother for that one  And no  I go by the moniker  St. Hollywood  St. as night  No, St. Hollywood  As I really  Actually from Hollywood, California  I was born in Hollywood, California  Right  Do we got one more time to hear him sing  Can I have a request?  Do you do  Do you do any Nirvana?  No  No?  All right  I don't like that  I don't like it  It's a little teen spirit  I'd rather sing you Otis  Than Kurt  To be honest  Otis ready?  Yeah, see some Otis ready  Oh, you know  She's weary  Young girls  They do get weary  Wearing that same old 
[02:33:30]  Shaggy dress  But while she get weary  Come on  Try  A little tenderness  You know what?  I bet you the liquor  I bet you 10 years ago  You stunk  That liquor probably  Ruffed up that voice a little bit  It did something to his voice  Ruffed up the voice  Yeah, but the motherfucker's brilliant  Yeah, yeah  Ice, yeah  When he was  When he was drinking 
[02:34:00]  Whiskey vodka and lots of cigarettes  What I want to do is listen to him play now  I know  I don't know what to do  We have fucking like bands  Established bands  Established musicians  They come in  They play a song  And they're like  All right, let's get him the fuck out of here  Like, I just want to hear you fucking play shit  Can we play another song?  That's fucking good  Can we play another song?  I got no problem  I don't give a shit  People seem to be loving it out there  This is Mustard  One of my homeless guys  Let me set it up  Mustard will be on the homeless shopping spree next Thursday  Make sure you check him out tomorrow  We run right to the Apple store or whatever 
[02:34:30]  To fucking get him shit to sing  Yeah, no shit  Tent up terribly as I've been tired  I'd say if I had dug it  So I guess I could have known better  By the time I figure out the way  I figure out the rest  I want to study forever  And if you wanted to get it right 
[02:35:00]  You wanted to listen  You got to stick to the ladder  But as I'm looking in this face tonight  You said, I'll wait till I  I see you start to untether  And I said, what I've been?  Could I've been?  Should I've been the only one you want?  But I can't get my shit together  But I can't get my shit together  Cutter than  Shorter than 
[02:35:30]  Would I've been the only one you want?  But I can't get my shit  But I can't get my shit together  Yeah, yeah  But I can't get my shit together  But I can't get my shit together  I fucked it up  Sensitively as I've been bound  I bet  If I was to bet 
[02:36:00]  I bet I could have known better  But by the time you turn around  It's setting everything you get  Just got to  Top of the ladder  And if you wanted to get it right  If you wanted to rest  You got to stick to the  You got to stick to the  And as I'm looking in this face tonight  Instead of wearing the light  I see you start to untow  How the wrecked I said 
[02:36:30]  What I've been?  Could I've been?  Should I've been?  Should I've been the only one you want?  But I can't get it too  But I can't get my shit together  Should I've been?  Could I've been?  Would I've been the only one you want?  But I can't get it now  But I can't get my shit together  But I can't get mine  But I can't get my shit together  But I can't get mine  But I can't get my shit together  But I can't get mine 
[02:37:00]  But I can't get my shit together  But I can't get mine  But I can't get my shit together  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah  What are them?  What are them?  Shut up, man.  Jesus Christ.  I got to tell you this, man.  Simon Cowell fucking discovered Susan Boyle.  Well, we discovered Mustard.  Yeah, man. 
[02:37:30]  There's not some traffic studio we could just sit him in all day and give him his own channel or something?  I mean, he's only getting tracks from an album.  He just did three tracks.  You guys, what, seven more?  I got more.  I got more.  I got more.  Of course.  God, Sam.  I got more.  Mustard.  Mustard, I will say this right now.  This fucking universe is fucked.  I will say this right now.  I will fund a CD.  No problem.  I will fucking get a CD made.  I have musicians.  I have an engineer. 
[02:38:00]  All I need is money.  We got Drew Boogie.  We got a really good engineer, for real.  Okay, fine.  Let's do it.  I mean, if you have no one else, I will fucking fund.  I will put money forward so this fucking guy gets a CD out there.  Because I don't...  And you know what, Mustard?  Mustard, I don't want to...  That was great.  He got up and, like, sat down.  I know.  Mustard, I don't even want a cent from the CD, but I will...  Just...  I hope that in the session, he's all drunk and he bites you.  We're here with his friends who play spoons.  We're here with his fucking musicians who play spoons and they just talk inside of cups. 
[02:38:30]  Mustard, we need a jug.  Somebody play a jug.  Somebody play a jug.  That's a fucking jug band.  Right.  Fucking...  Fucking...  Ham on, Ham on, have you heard?  I don't want to know.  He goes to fund it.  He gets in the studio.  Mustard goes, shut the fuck up.  Oh, I got this.  Ham on, Ham on, have you heard?  Get back there.  You know what, I'll...  I'm going to buy your mocking pearls.  I'll take that chance.  I'll take that chance. 
[02:39:00]  Although it didn't work out well when we got Gray Wolf in the studio.  Let's not forget.  That's true.  Let's not forget the Shelter Me, man.  This is from Lord Audition.  This is motherfucking Shelter Me.  That fucking Shelter Me needed one more verse and we had a massive hit on our hands.  This is the reason people are fucked up.  Right.  And we tried for years to get that second verse and it never happened.  Motherfucker.  He gets in the studio and nobody goes, this is it, man.  And he just screams.  And it's just starting hitting everybody with the guitar.  I mustered, motherfucker. 
[02:39:30]  Hey, I'll be people with guitars.  I've done that a couple times, yes.  That's happening.  You're watching the songs you were playing.  These are the fucking songs.  You're not the balls of me.  Fucking throw a fuck on you and light you on fire.  I'll fucking take that chance.  The clock is ticking.  Fucking money is ticking off.  And Joe's sitting there going, you don't know the real fucking mustard.  You have no fucking idea.  Joe's like, whatever, wait until you see what happens.  Joe's going, stupid white boy. 
[02:40:00]  White boy, you think, dude.  I'm a cracker, cracker ass cracker.  I'm a t-shirt, cracker ass cracker.  Oh, shit.  Opie's so fucking touched.  Dude, I can't wait.  He goes in and mustard flicks out.  And he plays with studio time.  And he tries to choker with a guitar string.  Oh, that's an interesting idea.  I've never tried it.  Pulled into the drum kit.  And this motherfucker's too talented to not have something happen. 
[02:40:30]  Mustard's an ass some kind of way.  Did you try to get shit on CD?  What happened over the years?  I have a CD.  I have a couple of dance.  Yeah, but we don't know how to get it.  Well, I have it in my pocket.  Yeah, you have a couple in your pocket.  I remember last night.  No, I have the original in my pocket.  You can't have it, but you can try to play it if you want.  I'd rather hear you live, man.  I'd rather hear you live.  You've got a nice little show.  Hey, uh...  It's in there somewhere.  I don't know.  Anthony and I are huge fans of Alice in Chains.  You got any Alice in Chains?  I don't play Lane, but I don't play Alice.  But I love Alice in Chains.  Okay, all right. 
[02:41:00]  I was just asking.  I'm the man in the box.  Right.  Well, the creep did.  The creep is just ridiculous.  That was a great version of that.  No, Lane is one of the great losses, I think.  Lane Staley, Shannon Hoon, Kurt, obviously.  Elliot Smith, you know.  These are people I wish I had a chance to know, you know.  And now they're gone.  Do you have a guitar on the street all the time?  No.  How do you write these songs, man?  Well, you know, you get it.  Well, in Washington Square Park.  This is Washington Square Park.  In 1941, Woody Guthrie.  You know Woody Guthrie?  Yeah.  Woody Guthrie came to Washington Square Park in 1941.  He slept in that park.  He lived in that park. 
[02:41:30]  He ate in that park.  He shit in that park.  He fucked in that park.  He bled in that park.  So have I.  And he brought to the world what was known as American folk music.  When Bob Dylan came to New York, he came to New York looking for Woody Guthrie.  Where do you find Woody Guthrie?  Washington Square Park.  Joan Baez, Patti Smith, William S. Burroughs.  There's a mural in a supermarket on LaGuardia and Bleecker that features a bunch of people.  Except there's like, there's Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain have no business being in the mural.  But everybody else in that mural are all people who have lived in and around Washington Square Park or the village. 
[02:42:00]  You know, it's known as Greenwich Village.  When I came to New York, the book I was reading was Bob Dylan's Chronicles.  And it's all about how when he first came to New York.  And so that's what I did.  I came to Washington Square Park.  You know, I thought that's what you do.  You know what's fucked up?  We, now remember the great late Tippi Thomas.  We saw Tippi fucked up first.  Then we saw him sober when he was in the hospital. 
[02:42:30]  Remember that?  Yes, of course.  And we were like, yeah, we were like, holy shit.  So here's the problem.  I know there's a problem.  I'm not stupid.  We are seeing Mustard at the top of his game right now.  Sober, fucking.  I'm not sober, but I'm not fucked up.  I'm not fucked up.  When he's fucked up, I bet you wouldn't even fucking recognize him.  I'm an animal.  I'm an asshole.  I'm such an asshole.  14 hours ago, he was a little difficult to deal with. 
[02:43:00]  What's the percentage that he is?  12 cops to hold me down one day.  12 cops to hold me down.  Oh, that's great.  12 cops.  This is like a year ago.  This is like a year ago.  Is this an aberration right here, or is this regular?  He's pretty good.  I mean, we had a long conversation last night, and I tried the technique today where he had  half a $20 bill in his pocket from last night, because I did have to kind of convince him. 
[02:43:30]  It comes down.  If you make it six hours from now to when I need you in the morning, I'll give you the  other half a $20 bill.  Listen, your only chance, motherfucker, is to fucking do the album now.  I know.  That's what I'm starting to think.  It's either D-Boy around.  Either do it now, or the whole band, the backup band, has to be a SWAT team.  Just in case shit goes off, you've got to have a riot squad as the band.  Now, do this album right fucking now. 
[02:44:00]  Where's the other half of $20?  Let me tape it together for you.  Now, Mustard, what are the odds you're going to be in the homeless shopping spree next Thursday?  I think I'm going to bring some people with me, too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He's going to...  You know what?  Like what we were talking about, how last week I had a little difficulty, and Liquor Man  and the other fellows with him were kind of standby sort of guys, because like the first  time we did it back at NEW, when we got to the radio station and they were scared because 
[02:44:30]  they thought it was the setup.  The setup.  You know, guys like Joe and guys like Mustard, they're like ambassadors now, because they're  going to go out and they were there here today, and they got $90 in their pocket.  They're buying the booze today, let's be honest.  They're going to go buy the booze today.  I'm buying the 1516.  So when he's sitting there with the 1516 and they're all drinking and he's talking about  how he went on the radio, people are now going to look for me the rest of the week.  Yeah, it's a good fucking thing.  It's like, you know, hang out, it's a fun day, everybody goes out, get some fucking coats, 
[02:45:00]  whatever you need for the winter.  I mean, I wouldn't be...  I'm not making any promises, but I swear to God, I wouldn't be surprised someone buys  you a fucking guitar.  Right.  That's what I...  Our listeners are fucking, you know...  That's what I need.  You know what's hilarious?  I like this one.  What's hilarious is I've never seen two more lax homeless guys.  You're trying to convince a homeless guy to go on a fucking shopping spree right now.  I was like, yeah.  You're going to go get the free shit?  Eh, it might go down.  I don't know.  It might be busy though. 
[02:45:30]  Well, yeah, honestly, can I...  Wait, can I respond to that?  Honestly, it's an interesting thing.  You get what you need.  You know, whether you want to send me to the mall or not, I sit there on the sidewalk and  it's amazing to me.  Yesterday I needed gloves.  So I walked into McDonald's and somebody left a pair of gloves there.  You know, you really...  You find what you need.  You cannot go hungry.  People always bring you food.  There's soup kitchens all over the city.  Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask you, man.  Do you ever have to eat out of the trash cans or is that like old school clothes?  I have.  No, I have. 
[02:46:00]  Mostly what I do is during lunchtime I'll sit in the park and I'll watch people eat and  then when they're done, I'll be like, are you going to finish that?  Or I'll wait until they throw it away and just, you know.  You're hoping you get it before it hits the garbage.  Yeah, but these days, no.  I just sit in front of McDonald's.  Again, I just sit in front of McDonald's.  Somebody bought me a whole Angus, you know, the Angus restaurant style burger they have.  They have the whole kaboot, you know, the fries and Coke and the whole thing.  They just think everybody's going to buy 15, 16 with the money that they give.  Right, so they want to teach you.  But people will fucking feed you.  They want to teach you.  Because they don't want to give you money because they think you're going to spend it on booze or heroin. 
[02:46:30]  And to back up, Anthony, from earlier, when you see Mustard, don't be confused.  It's not Eastside Dave.  It's Mustard.  I know.  Yeah, somebody was saying this.  Because Eastside Dave wants to do the homeless shopping spree, but we already got one now, Dave.  This guy looks like you with a long beard.  I want to finish my story about Washington Square Park.  Yeah, go, man.  My first night in Washington Square Park, I met a man named Luters Massillion.  I love that I get to say his name on the radio.  Luters Massillion is an old crazy.  And now he's a crazy wingman. 
[02:47:00]  He's the kind of guy you want.  He's obsessed with something called psychokinetics.  He believes that his entire life, everything he does is controlled by doctors and mind waves, sound waves.  They're controlling him, and everything he does is somebody else's responsibility.  He's an incredible guitar player, though.  But he thinks he wrote Sympathy for the Devil.  Really?  And he gave it to Nick Jagger.  He thinks he wrote it.  You know the dude from The Soloist.  He probably did.  Can I say Tom tells a story about a very famous musician that he swears is true and we believe 
[02:47:30]  to be Tom?  What's the story?  Can I suggest an idea for the homeless shoppers?  I'm just saying that.  I wouldn't be surprised if the story he just told is true.  Some more incentive for him to stay sober?  Is that he gives one of those circle concerts right in the middle of this mall?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, believe me.  And he fucking, you get him an amp and a fucking guitar and he does a few songs in the middle  to give a concert.  Maybe a Christmas song or something. 
[02:48:00]  And the other homeless guys, he's ready, he comes early, he does a fucking concert, and  that's the fucking money.  And the other homeless guys go around with hats, collect all the money that fucking Mustard  is getting from his music, and they spend the money with that shit.  Yeah.  That they make the money with the...  Remember all that's...  Because Mustard is the work, motherfucker.  What's Joe do?  Beatbox?  He just...  Maybe Joe does.  Give me a beat, Joe.  Give me a beat.  You got a haban?  Come on, fuck.  What do you got going on?  Come on, money, Joe. 
[02:48:30]  Let's do this shit.  What the fuck is wrong with Joe?  I love how Patricia just beat me up about the CD thing, and then you came up with that  logical scenario.  Also, we're going to give him a weapon at the mall.  He just runs through it.  Beats a woman in the head at the Fendi store.  Yeah, give him a 40-pound guitar with a long handle on the end of it.  We should take a break.  Joe and Mustard definitely going to be at the Homeless Shopping Spree next Thursday.  Man, this thing just got pumped up to another level. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Next Thursday, we're going to announce the mall on Monday.  We're doing afternoon drive, so you can check it out on the radio as these guys shop and  do their thing, and Mustard will probably play a few songs in the mall.  We'll figure it all out.  Yep.  Do you have one more cover you could play us to break with, Mustard?  Or are we overdoing it?  I don't actually do a lot of covers, but I could do another original if you'd like.  Yeah, your originals are good.  What the fuck?  Why not?  I used to do a bunch of covers, but I forget them, you know?  Yeah, I hear you.  All right, this is Mustard as we go to break.  We'll continue with Patrice and Joe DeRosa in a minute or two. 
[02:49:30]  And I've been out of my head, I've been crazy for days, I've been lazy in monumental ways.  And I've been left here for days, I've been constantly crazed, I've been pastored and pondered and appraised.  I haven't taught myself too long, I've had to force myself to talk. 
[02:50:00]  And I've been at it for days, I've been down here since June.  But I'm still stuck in the middle with you.  Hard to say why I sing sad songs.  Hard to say why you've hanged to stand alone. 
[02:50:30]  Hard to say what I'm on about.  But maybe, baby, I could do whatever.  Now, it's not up for debate, let's not open the floor.  Because, baby, you know we've both been here once or twice before.  But we got here too late, yeah, the hour's that through.  And I'm still stuck in the middle with you. 
[02:51:00]  Hard to say why I sang sad songs.  Hard to say why you've hanged to stand alone.  Hard to say why you've hanged to stand alone.  But maybe, baby, I could do whatever.  Hard to say why I sing sad songs.  Hard to say why you think you've hanged to stand alone. 
[02:51:30]  Hard to say why you've hanged to stand alone.  Hard to say why I'm on about.  But maybe, baby, I could do whatever.  This fucking mustard guy, holy shit.  Who's not going to the homeless shopping spree now?  Next Thursday, at a mall close to the New York City area. 
[02:52:00]  Manhattan, anyway.  I don't know what.  I'm, like, blown away.  You know who is going?  John Mayer will be there.  He'll be there.  More.  We should have never went to break, because fucking Patrice with his John Mayer.  Anthony with his reenactment of Mustard recording the CD that I want to produce.  Why the fuck did we go to break?  Where did we start?  The whole thing is you.  I want to hear the John Mayer shit, though.  My girl texts, he better copyright. 
[02:52:30]  My girl texts, he better copyright his shit.  Because most people are like, John Mayer will be out there enjoying it.  So we just start laughing at John Mayer's new concert.  Maybe John Mayer.  Why?  And performing this new song called Fuck Mustard.  Why?  Mustard is a stupid motherfucker.  Please go get my new album, Mustard, Suck My Dick, and Lick My Asshole. 
[02:53:00]  You made me another zillion, Mustard, you dumb homeless bum.  Why?  This next song is called Mustard, Try to Come Against My Lawyers.  This is just stealing all mustard dishes.  We can't handle money and buy millions.  How you gonna sue me, Mustard?  Ah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah boo.  Stephen S from Bayshore writes, Mustard is, smells like a John Mayer.  It's kind of like John Mayer and Nirvana.  For my encore, I'd like to play a song called Mustard, ah ha ha ha. 
[02:53:30]  Parentheses, Mustard, schmustard, with a picture of a middle finger next to it.

[03:09:30]  just crazy  he keeps running  he can't first  into it  oh my god  look at fucking  how short she is  you know what  fuck Snooki  in the fucking ass  in her fuck hole  fuck you  in your fuck hole  this motherfucking  Snooki  we had  we had her  we were gonna have  her on Monday  or Tuesday  this Jersey Shore  by MTV  is huge right now  and she  she even posted  like us talking  about her  on one of her  YouTube channels  and then the  publicist got involved  and now she's on  fucking Wendy Williams 
[03:10:00]  there's such pieces  of shit on this show  dude it's fucking  embarrassing  it's embarrassing  it's a great watch  do you remember when  I used to do a bit  about it  like a few years ago  remember when they  used to have the  fucking true life  documentaries about  the Jersey Shore  they did two of them  yeah of course  that's why they went  with the whole series  they were great  what took them so long  to do a series man  no kidding  it was a nice  five year gap  and we're getting  info on the  on the Snooki  punch  that we talked  about earlier  in the week  that episode  is next week  news story 
[03:10:30]  on the guys  who knocked  out Snooki  got it right here  maybe we could  get that guy  in the air  because he got  arrested for it  but this is how  it went down  suppose he's a  teacher in New York  City  gym teacher  or something  MTV's Jersey Shore  is packing a punch  but it's not the  kind of punch  that you might  think  this clip  of one of the  girls on the show  getting socked  in the face  has now gone  viral  and the guy  who clocked her  allegedly  24 year old  Brad Farrow  is a gym teacher  in Queens  reportedly punched  the girl  known as Snooki  after stealing 
[03:11:00]  her drink  MTV plans  to run a PSA  on domestic violence  after this episode  heirs  you know  Farrow has been  taken out  of the classroom  and he has  been reassigned  has he  Jesus  just reassigned  yeah I know  he punched  so hard  in the fucking  face  you saw the  clip right  no  I don't have  cable anymore  man  I'm really  missing out  on a lot  of shit  why no cable  Joe  I wasn't  watching it  so I just  got rid of it  no you don't  watch all the  movie channels  but you watch  cable 
[03:11:30]  no that's  what I wasn't  watching  all I wanted  was the movie  channels  and they  wouldn't  you can't  do it  so I just  got Netflix  on my TV  through Xbox  and I just  watch fucking  flicks  Anthony  they previewed  the punch  last night  and it's a  longer clip  than what  we've been  playing for  everybody  here  I mean  the audio  version  obviously  they're trying  to get to  know me  like all of  them  they're like  you know  what Snooki  you're a real  fool girl  I'm like  thank you  like finally  you're going 
[03:12:00]  to jail  what happened  why was Tiger's  mom there  she's everywhere  now  she really  shows up  in the  strangest  spot  I fucking  love the  tag of  he punched  her in the  face after  he stole  her drink  I mean  that is  just a  fucking  bully move  he stole  her drink  and then  belts her in  the face  look at  what a  mook  he is  that's  the only  word you  could use  to describe  that guy  a mook  where's the  clip  where's the  video  I gotta  see it 
[03:12:30]  again  I just  love seeing  does he  just straight  clock her  it's kind  of a  Chris Rock  thing  but you  understand  I  understand  well look  if you  gotta punch  a woman  make it  be one  of these  chicks  at least  god damn  you haven't  seen this yet  Joe  no  fuck  you gotta be  impressed by  the punch  though  close range  like that  holy shit  guy knows  what MMA  looks like  he punched  dude it  literally looks  like her  head flies  off  it looks  like he  punched  a mannequin  and the  head flew  off  you punch 
[03:13:00]  a dude  like that  that's how  you punch  another man  when he  does something  to your  fucking  mother  but see  this is the  fucking thing  man  she's getting  all in his  face  I'm not  saying he  should have  clocked her  like that  I'm not  advocating that  but she's  all in his  fucking face  with her  finger  like that  it's like  you can't  do that  shit  man  some guys  will snap  on that  shit  I think  the punch  looks worse  than it was  because her  hair goes  flying  stop  that's a  jawbreaker  yeah like  that's a way  you should 
[03:13:30]  never talk  to mustard  for instance  never get  close to him  like that  and wave  your fucking  finger  some guys  will snap  from that  shit  how do we  word  that every  guy who  sees this  is like  yay  how do you  condone that  and still  keep your  job  as a  square guy  and he just  goes  you know what  oh thank  god  I kind of  understand what  you're saying  because there's  women out there  like Snooki  that know that  guys won't 
[03:14:00]  hit them  so they get  away with a  lot more  shit  so then what  are you  supposed to  do  like if a  guy's in  your face  like that  you're gonna  swing  right  but girls  know they  can get  away with  some shit  because most  guys are  not gonna  hit you  it's a  tough  it's a  tough  thing  I don't  condone  this shit  to be  completely  honest  with you  but I  sort of  you don't  condone it  but you  because this  chick is  saying some  shit  knowing that  most likely  this guy  wasn't gonna  hit her  but in this  case she  was wrong  and you don't  condone it  because you  don't do it 
[03:14:30]  there's no  circumstance  to make you  clock a chick  like that  but you  go oh  please  god  somebody just  clock her  in her jaw  and there's  you know  the taboo  the taboo  will always  outweigh it  is the  problem  you know  I did  I did  a bit  on my  cd  about how  I wish  I was  a cop  so I  could  clock  a chick  in her  head  for the  first  time  ever  but that  was  that  was  almost  the  example  I  used  where I  was  like  I 
[03:15:00]  but it's  true  it's like  you get  in somebody's  face like  that  it's like  that's the  thing  you're dealing  with a  gender  that's been  raised  to never  have  physical  fear  ever  ever  you know  what I mean  you know  what's odd  too  why are they  running a  domestic  violence  it's not  domestic  violence 
[03:15:30]  it's a  guy in  a bar  that gets  pissed off  he's drunk  he fucking  belts a girl  in the face  that's not  domestic  violence  and because  they don't  give a shit  that's why  they're just  running  you know  what I mean  and Domino's  pizza is  like  taking away  the ads  but I'm like  how many  fights have  happened  and there's  been Domino's  pizza boxes  in the area  how many  drunk brawls  are over  some fucking  slices of  Domino's  how many  guys have  been stabbed  in the stomach  and it's 
[03:16:00]  just Domino's  laying around  some Domino's  but boom  this is  this is  what really  kills me  is I like  how because  this chick  got punched  in the face  that's where  all of a sudden  this show  became  offensive  and detrimental  to the culture  and all that  it's like  it is so much  worse than  a punch in the  face on so  many more  levels  the character  the integrity  of these people  what they represent  what they're going  to influence  young people  to think  they should  act like  that is  so much  more poisonous

[03:19:00]  a psycho  but I  just find  them to be  relentless  just every  day  they just  gotta come  at you  they just  wake up  they have  an agenda  they're like  these psycho  robots  that never  run out of  batteries  and every  day just  keep coming  at you  right  you gotta  deal with  that  every single  day  and you  literally  you know  every day  it's like  waves hitting  the beach  you know  every day  just eroding  a little more  your life away 
[03:19:30]  you know  just waking  up inch  by inch  and every  day just  why are you  hanging out  with him  he drinks  too much  where'd you  buy that  that's ugly  throw it  out  so one day  he's just  hanging out  in the middle  of a lagoon  just floating  there with  your baseball  cards  and waving  to your friends  back on the  shore  don't get me  tickets I  still like  sports  oh here she  comes here she  comes hey  honey how you  doing  no I'm 
[03:20:00]  trying to learn  how to pick  my battles  with my  girls  you know  it's what I  am you know  I used to  argue all the  time  I'm just  trying to  pick the  battles  some days  they come  at you  you just  gotta let  them go  you just  let them go  follow them  to whatever  dumb shit  they wanna  do  like hey  get a  picnic  we'll have  a picnic  you bring  the good  bank  in  then other  days you  just gotta  get your  hand up  you just  gotta  just create  this perimeter  something for  them to  bounce off 
[03:20:30]  like  you just  send that  psycho energy  in another  direction  buy yourself  a couple of  hours for  freedom before  they bounce  off something  else  they stop  coming  they stop  they stop  they're  very  caring  no they're  relentless  they never  stop  and there's  no reason  for them to  stop  you know  why  because  you can't  hit them  that's what  it is  think about  that  there's no  physical 
[03:21:00]  ramifications  for being  an asshole  when you're  a woman  do you know  how much of a  how much of a  dick I would  be if it was  socially unacceptable  to kick the  shit out of me  dude I would  be trashing  everybody I  saw  see some  big muscle  bomb guy  I go to  the fucking  gym  slap his  protein  but I  can't do  that right  every guy  has a line  and if I  cross the  line I  get blasted  in the  face  totally  acceptable  right  well with 
[03:21:30]  women there's  no line  they can  just keep  fucking  coming at  you  they can  do stuff  worthy of  like a  suplex  and they'll  just stare  right next  to it  they're not  able to  decency  to run  away  they're like  light your  clothes on  fire  they're like  ta-da  I did  that shit  oh yeah  and I  was so  proud of  my work  I stuck  around to  see your  reaction  I invited  a couple  of friends  to heckle  you as  you try  to stomp  it out  with your  bare feet  oh yeah 
[03:22:00]  they'll like  key your  car  sign their  name  Susan  did  this  shit  you're  sitting  like  now  can I  at least  put her  in a  headlock  give her  a couple  of  I  feel bad  for women  that you  never get  to feel  that  you guys  should  do it  to each  other  you know  just every  once in a  while  just haul  off  and just  blast  one of  your  friends  in the  face  you know  it's good  for you  no I know  yeah I know  it hurts  you know  you can't  feel your  nose  your ears  are ringing  but I'm 
[03:22:30]  telling you  man  it clears  your head  and it  causes you  to like  evaluate  yourself  I swear to  god  anytime I ever  got punched  in the face  I was always  pissed  but at some  point during  the drive  home  I'd always  be thinking  like you  know  it's kind  of being a  dick  back there  you know  can I  really think  about it  I probably  shouldn't have  said that  last shit  you know  you'd like  make that  adjustment  that guy's  an asshole  I can't  believe he's  just gonna  say this  time  get down 
[03:23:00]  with the  sickness  Opie and  Anthony  look at us  giving you  four hours  of original  radio on a  Friday  that's crazy  to do  if you're  on radio  just crazy  why would  you do  that  I want to  thank Joe  DeRosa  and Patrice  O'Neill  for stopping  in  I'd like to  thank you  for having  us  on behalf  of Joe  and Patrice  thanks  buddy  sincerely  you want  to do  a quick  nope  there's a bunch  of stuff  we just  didn't do  but we  can do  it quick 
[03:23:30]  for example  Barry Bonds  finally saying  he's done  two years  later  he's finally  admitting he's  done with  baseball  Barry Bonds  two years  after his  last game  so that  came out  today  new movies  The Princess  and the Frog  81%  positive reviews  yuck  on Rotten Tomatoes  Rotten Tomatoes  right  you go there  for your movie  reviews  yes I do  a little bit  right  it's not bad  it's kind of  foolproof  you can't  you know  if one  cocksucker  has a  vendetta 
[03:24:00]  and it's  like a  97%  and this  dickface  gives it  a bad  review  you know  he's a  dick  and that  dickface  could be  the guy  doing your  local  reviews  in your  paper  so you  think  the movie  sucks  and you  go there  and go  no  he's  the only  dickface  like  Bad  Lieutenant  got a  zero  in one  paper  and a  two  and a  half  three  in  another  paper  well  the two  main  rags  here in  New York  they're  very different  with their  movie  that's  that  it's  everyone 
[03:24:30]  in the  movie  this  is how  stupid  we are  we've been  saying  it's a  soccer  movie  for a  week  it's a  rugby  movie  it's  rugby  not  soccer  that's  the only  sport I  give a  shit  less about  than  soccer  rugby is  pretty  impressive  man  it's  Nelson  Mandela  rugby is  a sick  sport  he does  an awful  Nelson  it's  fine  American  people  to do  this  accent  make me  sick  to my  fucking  stomach  anyone  who has 
[03:25:00]  to  I  sound like  Herbie  Villachas  good  that's what  they all  sound like  this is  pretty  accurate  you have  to understand  that we  will have  to win  the game  because our  country needs  it  oh shut  up  Morgan Freeman  our country  no  that's  Matt Damon  it is  it's  everyone in  the movie  we have  to win  Danny  can you go  to  powerhouse  videos  dot com  slash  bitch  before  everyone 
[03:25:30]  else  goes  there  I  think  they  animated  the  snooki  punch  Peewee  Herman  says  movie  about  Peewee's  playhouse  is being  made  you know  that's  going to  be  like  a  fucking  dirty  version  I  have  no  doubt  in my  mind  I doubt  it  that shit's  been in  development  for years  but they  go edgy  with this  I'm  telling you  kind of  like what  the  Brady  bunch  did  when  they  first  came out  with those  movies  and went  kind of  edgy  yeah  they  went  edgy  the plot  no  fucking  yeah  they  did  the plot  online  they really  mocked  the whole  series  what  the plot  for it's  online  the IMDB  on IMDB 
[03:26:00]  but it  doesn't  sound  don't give  me a  spoiler  it just  sounds  don't spoil  it for me  don't tell  me  we were  discussing  a movie  and Joe  DeRosa  actually had  a run  out  because  he didn't  want  the movie  spoiled  for him  I didn't  want to  know  the end  I want  to know  the whole  movie  and then  I'll see  it still  it's visual  movies  what do you  want to  go through  the journey  yeah  it's stupid  yeah  remember all  the work  Hitchcock  did  that creates  suspense  fuck him  it's called  dramatic tension  and Hitchcock's  movies  yeah really  how is  someone  going to spoil 
[03:26:30]  a Hitchcock  movie for you  the birds  stink  Alfred Hitchcock  movies do not  hold up  they make me  sick  oh Patrice  would you  stop it  you don't like  Hitchcock  movies  who does  name one  that's good  that you  still go  wow  strangers  on a train  rope  you're just  a romantic  sissy  you run out  on spoilers  that doesn't  count  North by  Northwest  is that a  Hitchcock movie  we know them  all  do you  have you  seen any  of them  or did you  see half  of one  and make  a full  judgment  on all  Hitchcock 
[03:27:00]  I saw  North by  Northwest  that movie  went on  for fucking  ever  it's a  great flick  though  Halloween's  better  why because  the scary  stuff  happened  during the  day  you know  it's a joke  Joe thinks  he's an intellectual  so anything  intellectual  that stimulates  Joe  he doesn't like  Jaws  I don't like  the whole  thingy thingy  with Jaws  shut the fuck up  Joe  Star Wars is one of my  favorite movies  that's not intellectual  there's no suspense  to that  motherfucker  you like shit  that makes you think  like you're a thinker  Alfred Hitchcock's movies 
[03:27:30]  did nothing  so  a cocksucker  you know what it is  it was horror movies  before you was allowed  to have them  the psycho stab  sucks  watching the knife  not hit her  and then you  don't know what  you're talking about  right now  I watched the movie  I can have an opinion  you see when a guy  fell down the stairs  as a psycho  the dumbest look  he makes me sick  yeah what was that  he's going like  exactly  and the Beatles  and the Beatles suck  because they weren't able  to do what people  can do now  I enjoy the Beatles  I mean this is 
[03:28:00]  you're making  Jaws didn't use any CGI  he sucked  it's what I'm saying  it's like this argument  you're arguing against  the guy that broke down  fucking open doors  for future filmmakers  he was doing shit  that's never been done  who did he break down  doors for  oh Jesus Christ  exactly  for everybody  I'm not gonna  don't force me to like him  if I don't want to  I'm not  but you can't say  it's before you had  horror movies  it's not  I don't like his profile  I don't like it  I don't like his little profile  you have the same profile  it never fit  you have the same  it never fit into that 
[03:28:30]  look Danny found  the fucking stare scene  it's Martin Balsam  ladies and gentlemen  coming to the stage  Patrice O'Neil  bum bum  bum bum  bum bum  bum  that's hilarious  what did he green screen  this shit  ah  ah  oh shit  how did he get that  cut on his face  what is he doing  what is he doing  what is that  why is this suspense  it's not  it's horror  why is that suspenseful  why is that a thriller  and other things  not horror  there's nothing about  that movie  there are other parts  that are suspense 
[03:29:00]  there's suspense  about the curls  on the fucking  on the slide  were you in  scary movie 4  they cut  they cut it out  no cause  good  they cut it out  they cut it out  wait the guy who's in  scary movie 4  is saying  Hitchcock movies stink  maybe you're  this is my thing  people think  people think  that's the problem  everybody has to  compare everybody else  I can't say another  fat person is fat  cause I'm fat  I got eyes  motherfucker  I can be in  shit stain too  and that doesn't mean  I like the birds 
[03:29:30]  eat ass  eat ass  compare yourself  to other people  you fuck face  dick  ho  just because  just because  I was in some  loser shit  you're not a loser  shut up  misery loves company  you fucking idiot  I fucking don't like  the birds  Anthony you know what  I'm producing shit  shit stain too  yes  shit stain too  I wanna see that  people kill me  hey you're fat  look who's talking  I know  I'm fat too  but you're fucking  fat too  fat fuck  35 fat 
[03:30:00]  god damn  alright what's up  with Avatar  Avatar getting good  reviews already  not reviews  but they did  the London premiere  or whatever  standing ovation  and two people  had two different  one was like  it's gonna get an Oscar  the other one  did a two page review  about how amazing  the movie is  and I think  it's for sissies  just like Titanic  another movie  I can't understand  I liked the  I don't get it  I don't understand  where the billion  dollars comes from  as opposed to  the Dark Knight  how does that 
[03:30:30]  make a billion  in the Dark Knight  like I don't get it  I don't get that movie  cause they brought  the broads in  the chips came in  for the love story  and the guys were there  for the let me see  the fucking CGI  what action was in it  the ship sinking  that ship sinking  was like a 45 minute scene  bouncing off of the  fucking smoke stack  what the fuck  what were you watching  I know  that fucking  beautiful pinball  scene where the  people fall down  that ship sinking  is fucking  that is pretty amazing  at least at the time  especially  was a great depiction  of the Titanic  sinking  no it stinks  because it was before 
[03:31:00]  they could do effects  like that  so it sucks  now the CGI  gets so much better  first of all  don't try to divide  don't try to fucking  join forces with Anthony  yeah that's exactly  what I'm doing  you barely liked the movie  barely  you liked it for the love scene  hey Anthony  hey Anthony  hey Anthony  hey Anthony  you never saw  Empire Strikes Back  Darth Vader's Luke's dad  you fucking faggot  still enjoy it  you fucking queer  you ruined it for me  he's just upset  because he's sensitive  did you cry when  DiCaprio went under  huh  you just showed  you liked the movie  yeah he did 
[03:31:30]  come on  yeah but we're saying  you loved it for the love scene  yeah  I loved it for  a little tear  when DiCaprio went under  it had a lot of  beautiful parts  what about the  what about the  I would fucking  I would like  any one of you  to embrace me  while I watch DiCaprio  slide off of that  fucking boat  no I'll bring up  something  what about the fact  that Clooney  falls in love  with a girl  that's married  fucking dickhead  is that the spoiler  you're a fucking asshole 
[03:32:00]  you're a fucking asshole  and you loved the studio  fuckface  stupid  now he's hurt  now you can't see the movie  it spoiled it for you  ass  well god damn  it's the big deal  it's spoiled  let me explain what happened  and let me explain  how stupid you are  as a human being  why is everybody  turning on me  because everybody  went into this shit  because Patrice asked me  about this up in the air  because he's getting  good reviews  and I go  let me tell you  about this fucking movie  Joe goes  I don't want to hear  a spoiler  I go  leave the studio 
[03:32:30]  yeah  that was your mistake  yeah  what do you think  we're going to be  real friends to you  no that is real  no B  Joe  thank you  we had an idiot  left  and we still told him  hold on  hold on  let me finish my point  what you should have done  go oh my god  they're going to  fucking spoil this movie  for me  make believe you don't care  make believe you had to  go to the bathroom  or something  alright  so he just said  he knew we were  going to get you  eventually  I apologize  that I had faith  and trusted you  as a person  I'm a fucking asshole 
[03:33:00]  for that  I apologize for just  for being a smarmy asshole  who don't know  who don't know  how to be  like dick funny  I laughed  when he told the ending  I thought it was funny  I'm not angry  I've been telling you  the whole movie  I wasn't lying  he just fucking  encapsulated  stupid asshole  he thought he was  going to come back  and we was going to  go we finished  sit down Joe  and enjoy yourself  I just  I wanted to see  the movie  you fucking dumb  I wanted to see  the movie  I didn't want to  hear the ending  I don't think  that's ridiculous  I love when 
[03:33:30]  smart Joe is dumb  Joe prides himself  on his Egyptian  intelligence  and it's just  it's mere mortal  don't spread it around  that I'm Egyptian  he's fucking  he's like  this fucking goofy scene  like Psycho  look  I'm sure  some of his movies  but Psycho's  just in horror  my thing is  okay the problem is  the level of  the degree  of Alfred Hitchcock  he is revered  because the trees  it's the same reason 
[03:34:00]  why you revere  Chuck Berry  or the Beatles  or Little Richard  the way you do  because they  they were innovators  of the crowd  that's not why  you do  okay Lenny Bruce  okay  I understand  what he means  Hitchcock can mean  things  that doesn't mean  I laugh at Lenny Bruce  I laugh at  Colin and Pryor  we understand  Lenny Bruce  helped them be  Alfred Hitchcock  movies  don't hold up  but that's not  what you said  before  you said he stinks 
[03:34:30]  and the Beatles  hold up  which was a horrible  I think Hitchcock  holds up  I think Hitchcock  holds up  it's a horror scene  that birds movie  you're picking one movie  out of 40 movies  that he did  the other 40  name one  Vertigo  Rope is fucking incredible  here's why  he's a cocksucker  watch Rope  here's why  fucking Joe's a dick  he fucking says  he says the one  he says the one  that's fucking  like no one would say  it's not 
[03:35:00]  no one would say  it's a very popular movie  with Hitchcockians  North by Northwest  Great Flick  Great Flick  39 Steps  Great Flick  Psycho  Great Flick  Strangers on a Train  Great Flick  if you're  put a bomb  under the table  and you  make the bomb  but if you show  the bomb first  then you  shut the fuck up  breathy motherfucker  shut the fuck up  here's my technique 
[03:35:30]  to  I don't know why  he's fucking  Mr. Moto  but  I'm doing  Alfred Hitchcock  I thought you were  doing Mr. Miyagi  as he should be  you fucking  I liked his  I liked that  Alfred Hitchcock  shit TV show  where he'd come out  and go  good evening  good evening  tonight's episode  is  and then he would  tell like  what was going to  happen  and then 
[03:36:00]  that's a great  Hitchcock  by the way  sounds like  Warren Michaels  Warren Michaels  Alfred Hitchcock  Anthony's a prodigy  with that shit  man  he's the mustard  of voices  he is really  the mustard  of impersonation  I'm going to  bite your face  I'm going to prove  you all wrong  bite your face off  I'm going to prove  you all wrong  I mean I understand  what he means to  certain people like you  okay well that's fine  but what you said  before is he stinks  and that was what  I didn't agree with  I feel like getting  into the philosophical  reason why I think 
[03:36:30]  it just bores me  and I try to watch it  you know there's things  where you try to go  alright this is genius  and I know it's supposed  to be genius  let me be into it  and you go  what am I missing  I'm not stupid  I'm with you  I'm with you on a lot  of stuff from that era  I can't get into it  I'm like god damn  I try to  Lenny Bruce  I'm into it  I respect the man  he does not make me laugh  but to go  he stinks  or  I just  I just don't  I get it  but I'm not into it  those are two  very different statements 
[03:37:00]  which means it stinks  so I was arguing  no it doesn't mean that  it stinks means  you're not into it  no no no  it stinks means  it's got no merit  or quality  no not really  don't fucking  you're not the boss  of my stink meaning  I think I am  I think I know  what the definition  of it stinks is  Joe's sensitive  and I didn't realize  that too  I'm not sensitive  I'm laughing  I didn't realize  he was  listen to him  he's explaining  I'm with it  I'm with the stuff  Joe's a sensitive guy  I didn't realize  this fucking shit  look  you're right Joe  yeah he didn't like  the spoiler  you fucked up  up in the air  I don't like  what you guys said 
[03:37:30]  about the end of Titanic  I enjoy that scene  very much  that scene makes him cry  and you know  what that scene  makes him do  like a typical sissy  he loves his woman more  when he sees  what that guy did  and that love  that makes him  love his woman  more than he did  it's a guideline  I admit 100%  I cry at movies  frequently  which end scene though  because there was  the end where  he drips off  into the water  where the old bag  dies and goes back  into the fucking ship  and everything's  hunky dory  and they're all 
[03:38:00]  fucking  the part  the part that really  makes me cry  is when the old lady  at the end  opens her legs  and they find  the ship  inside  inside her clam  would you die  for your wife  would I die  for my wife  what the fuck  here's the scenario  though  the context is not  that a guy comes  and tries to rob you  and you step in front of him  and take a bullet  the idea is  it's freezing in the water  both of you could live  but you just choose  she's gonna live  and you're gonna  fucking die  but it's not supposed 
[03:38:30]  to be they both  can live  it's supposed to be  they both couldn't  stay  are you gonna just die  why are you trying  to knock down  my happiness  and everyone else's happiness  ready  because that's what he does  how about  thank you  how about  go fuck yourself  thank you  don't try to find  being fucking happy  no you just  shit on everybody  first of all  you can try  to take me  you can tell  you try that technique  to fucking  spray paint your way  over that question  would you die  for your wife  is a yes or a no  I'm fucking  not answering that  there you go  that's what the bullshit is  would you die 
[03:39:00]  would you die  for your girlfriend  that you loved  Anthony  you and your stupid  fucking  uh  I don't know  would you die  self worth  would you die  would you die  for your girlfriend  that you loved  no  there you go  that's a good question  would you die  for your fucking girlfriend  there you go  what's wrong with that  I didn't say  nothing was wrong  I just asked the question  and you called me  insecure  would you die  for your wife  you're trying to ruin  everyone's happiness  all you had to do  was say yes  and then it would have been fine  let me elaborate though 
[03:39:30]  this is going to lead  to another one  of your fucking questions  I didn't play with you  yes it's fine  I didn't play with you  you take your ball  you asshole  I'm trying to pick  the ball and go home  I have to elaborate  oh yes Anthony  like Patrice was saying  it's one of those things  where it's like  you know  the freezing water  or something like that  there could be circumstances  where you're like  holy shit  you gotta do something  you gotta protect it  and all of a sudden  you're like  oh fuck I'm dead  and something like that  happened  but a conscious thought 
[03:40:00]  of me or you  fuck you  I'm fucking  are you shitting me  yeah  are you shitting me  what what  Mr. Noble  exactly  and he's only saying it  out of emotion  he doesn't even have  a logical reason why  why  you wouldn't  why sir bump a lot  I would do the most  I can  I would do the most  and best I could  right up until  the moment  where  it means you're dead  and then it's all about 
[03:40:30]  me  thank you so fucking much  I'll fucking bring  flowers to the tombstone  why is her living in this  more important  than you living in it  that's what I want to say  that's my point  why  you said if you loved  your girl  you wouldn't do anything  to protect her  he already said he would  I would do everything  up until the point of  here's life or death  and then it's like  sorry  you're on your own  that romantic horse shit  I'm gonna die baby
