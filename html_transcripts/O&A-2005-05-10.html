<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing a blow-up doll in the studio, which led to a conversation about sex toys, their personal experiences, and the less-than-glamorous aftermath of passionate encounters, including humorous anecdotes about cleanup and shaving mishaps.  A caller then reported seeing Opie and Anthony signs at a WWE event, prompting a discussion about a Rolling Stone article that poorly represented their extensive interview and their bad investment experience with a former associate named Farid.  The hosts heavily criticized Howard Stern for allegedly stealing bits, specifically citing a song segment from a past Opie and Anthony "Most Offensive Song Contest," which they discussed at length, including its online availability and past controversies.  They then speculated on the short-lived marriage of Renee Zellweger and Kenny Chesney, contrasting it with the then-current relationship of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, and recounted a story about Bill Clinton making advances on Brendan Fraser's wife. Opie shared a story about meeting Groucho Marx before his death and losing a cherished photo.  Listener calls and banter concluded this segment.

The next segment began with a discussion about the surprisingly short time span between the present and the American Civil War, leading to humorous hypotheticals involving Groucho Marx.  This transitioned into a discussion of the word "consumption," its relation to tuberculosis, and their intern Travisâ€™s uncertain employment status due to Washington D.C. bureaucracy. The hosts played several increasingly desperate voicemails from "The Gregster" for a woman named Laura, followed by a discussion of a Whackbag video showing explicit female masturbation.  They debated playing the audio, considering the legal implications.  A discussion of Robert Plant's live versus studio vocals ensued, sparking a debate on Led Zeppelin versus Black Sabbath, with listener calls and anecdotes added.  A lawsuit against David Barton's gym alleging excessive sexual activity was discussed, along with playing a "Shenanigans" bit and a sexually explicit voicemail.  A final listener call ended this segment.

The third segment started with a caller recounting a violent gym locker room altercation.  This led to a discussion about a video of a young woman ("Psycho Girl") performing explicit acts while addressing a man named Matt, with much speculation about her age, mental state, and the video's origin.  Significant audio from this video was played, interspersed with listener calls providing unverified details. A humorous phone call with a Upright Citizens Brigade member impersonating a technically inept Jimmy Stewart providing tech support followed. The "F.U. Line" segment aired, followed by a discussion of their new T-shirts and the resulting workload for Opie's brother.  The hosts then discussed a 60 Minutes segment on teenage drinking, sharing their own teenage drinking experiences, illegal cable boxes, and softcore pornography, specifically mentioning *Cheerleaders* and a *Fairy Tales* adaptation, along with a video clip from 70s softcore depicting a gang rape in a locker room.  A caller described a Cinderella-themed pornographic film, and a former guest, Joe, recounted his reckless teenage drinking games, including setting a friend on fire with ether. The segment concluded with a Nathaniel Bryan stand-up routine and a discussion of Tony Danza's go-kart accident and his choice not to wear a helmet.

The final segment featured comedian Nathaniel as a guest. He recounted a story of facing racism on a construction job and using the N-word in his stand-up, describing his competition as "a bunch of fucking disingenuous queens." The hosts commented on the poor audio quality of his performance before discussing the smell of a nearby steakhouse and a Gamefly.com advertisement. A significant portion played audio clips from a "bin of bits," including a woman drinking urine, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Landon (initially misidentified as Michael Jordan) outtakes, Barry White cursing during a commercial recording, an original song about breasts, and a video of a woman dunking Tony Danza in a dunk tank.  Numerous voicemails from a man's "psycho ex-girlfriend" detailing their breakup were played, alongside a brief mention of a prank call to the White House during a media merger. The show concluded with listener calls and wrap-up comments.

[00:05:00]  hello good morning good morning you're checking out the on a virus spreading across america thanks  to xm satellite radio getting more gooder every day just before the mic's turned on  anthony uh had a little thing a little thing happened to him a little problem with the uh  decor in the studio and i was just thinking i don't think there's any other person out there 
[00:05:30]  that goes to quote work we know this isn't really work but technically it's our job you know  they say i guess before we're ready to broadcast anthony doesn't yell but raises voice pretty good  he goes all right you gotta move the blow-up doll i can't broadcast this way get that blow-up doll out  of here he puts the blow-up doll it's kind of to my left and a little behind me but well within my  peripheral vision and i can't have that i'm trying to talk and and it keeps catching my eye and 
[00:06:00]  distracting me like there's somebody back there he kind of moved it for some reason and as he walks  away i'm i'm kind of just reading the paper and out of the corner of my eye it starts sliding down  the wall so now it's a blow-up doll that's moving out of uh the corner of my eye who else has this  problem when they go to work i really don't think anybody else has the problem of the blow-up doll  distracting them during work and then they try to put it on the uh lesbian couch but it doesn't sit 
[00:06:30]  because one of those awful blow-up dolls it's not even like one of the real dolls those ones that are  really made nicely that look real it's that ah the big open mouth one with the the molded plastic face  and then just the beach ball plastic body look at that great ass what they have a oh my god they just  shoved a banana up its ass they're shoving stuff up the blow-up doll's butt they those things are so you 
[00:07:00]  ever see the ads for them in the porno magazines they show like hot illustrations of women yeah just like  and this is what shows up at your door in a big box with these big sharp seams running up our ass  crack yeah your neighbor's not suspicious when a huge box uh ends up on your doorstep with one of  these in it honestly has anyone ever used one of those has anyone here ever even used one of those  jimmy no you use one of those blow-up dolls um no i never have i use a jerk sleeve one time that's

[00:22:30]  thanks for reminding me i couldn't find my keys last week so i sent out a mass email and i got a response  they said they're behind the counter all right uh i don't know why they'd be behind the counter  we got to take care of some on a business here really fast the latest issue of rolling stone  magazine they did a whole article on satellite radio um they interviewed anthony and i were you in on  this one jimmy no you had something to do because jimmy's uh being included in just about all this stuff 
[00:23:00]  now and uh they talked to us for how long anthony seriously half hour 40 minutes yep we got uh one  quote each in the whole article and uh thank god we got a quote each and they dumbed us down big time  we were talking about some really cool stuff about why we love satellite radio and the article starts  off radio from outer space with fm radio losing listeners satellite stations energize the airwaves 
[00:23:30]  and the first line of the article says shock jocks opie and anthony can curse all they want on the  radio these days shock jocks because that's why we're here so we can curse that's right that's how  the article starts and then later on all we have is uh uh it's growing every day that's the fun part  about it says stern competitor opie born greg hughes who jumped to xm with partner anthony cumia after  they lost their fm show due to an fcc baiting sex and church stunt ed's cumia when we got into this 
[00:24:00]  we were thinking god what if there's no callers but the phones have been lit up since the beginning  that's it huh why waste 30 or 40 minutes of our time that was it that was it but it's cool to be  in rolling stone i'm not gonna lie to you talking about all the things that um we could do on satellite  and the technology the difference between satellite and terrestrial and that's it i hope the phones  ring eric logan got more quotes yeah he did didn't he by the way this rick cummings from ms communications 
[00:24:30]  here's his big quote arrogant arian commercial radio we have more listeners on our three stations in new  york than satellite has customers he's and then amazon's 97 hot 97 yeah and we throw our employees  under the bus douchebag that's a good uh that's somebody who really has a vision of the future  yeah and if that's the truth that they're not worried about it why are you fighting to try to  have it uh regulated yeah why why are you lobbying in in washington to have it regulated if you're not 
[00:25:00]  scared of it that fm radio we don't have to worry about it the am people were saying it's satellite  it's satellite radio versus commercial radio it's going to be a very very interesting fight the next  couple of years same are going to be a lot of fun the same arrogance that went into commercial tv  that's that what's what's uh yeah cable cable gonna do and now all the emmys are going to shows like  the sopranos or curb your enthusiasm or sex in the city uh-huh uh you know it's like now now what  you and they're trying so hard to copy that whole formula on regular television just ain't working 
[00:25:30]  well they're trying to regulate it and this is the argument well we don't think it's fair that they  shouldn't have different the same uh thing to operate with like the same rules to operate well  how about the same capital we can we just get commercial radio want to turn over uh or balance  out the money if you want to work like socialists scumbags yeah we should have the same uh they should  have the same regulations that we do no this is a pay service you're paying to get this you should be 
[00:26:00]  able to hear whatever you want and commercial radio is our best friend by the way because they're  they're they're the ones driving everyone to satellite radio the commercial loads the same  freaking music still still satellite radio i mean you could pick up your local paper there's there's  an article in the paper almost every day about satellite radio almost every day it's in uh the major  newspapers like you know the the new york times usa today uh the daily news the post news day here in  new york all have an article today about it again it's hitting all the magazines you know so they've 
[00:26:30]  they're they have already realized this is a serious competition and they still are doing the same  shit that is driving people to satellite radio you know it shows me small playlist jocks that babble  about nothing and very very very very long commercial loads a year ago driving around i was uh you know  you'd count the antennas you'd kind of look and see how many of those little antennas are on top of the  cars and uh you know however many however many you would see in an hour or so uh you'd see but 
[00:27:00]  now you notice how many more satellite radio antennas are on cars not even just the uh stock ones that  are on the new cars that are coming out but uh older cars you see them popped right up there on the  trunk lid or the roof of the car and we've already adjusted our thinking when we first got uh texan we're  thinking we we still need commercial radio we got to get on some stations that you know we got to figure this out we got to do both we  got to do both to get a big audience and uh what we're seven eight months in already yeah and 
[00:27:30]  already i could care less about that because because this audience is growing every single day you know  this show is going to be uh uh much bigger than the one we did when we were syndicated to 20 cities  across america yep it's so obvious now you know and stupid freed and citadel laughing at us going where  have you guys been no one no one's paying attention to you anymore remember that talk around christmas time  yeah well uh i i'm not one for taking much of farid's advice  like hey get in on this ipo on citadel stock you motherfucker jesus christ what a beating we're

[00:29:00]  it to go from 19 to about i don't know 22 maybe 20 yeah 22 just make a few bucks punch out of it dump  out that piece of shit has been on a a it's just been plummeting for over a year now over a year  it's just i looked at the chart yesterday it made me sick i know because you emailed me i emailed over  i go congratulations we're at an all-time low we're at up all-time low and i hate 12 10 i hate

[00:30:30]  going up it's going above the ipo so you try to buy the day the stock becomes available to the public  you're never getting that ipo price it's going to be a lot more and then the people that got  in on the ipo are sitting pretty going hey look at me now look at google people that got in on the  ipo google ridiculous i think the offering price was in the 90s and uh now it's it's sitting at 200 and  change 90 something yeah that's a lot still it is a lot but now it's a 200 over 200 bucks

[00:33:30]  for a company uh that was bought out by marconi and if you were hired in by a certain date they  give you a thousand shares in the company they started at like 20 a share uh last time i checked  they were down to about uh 92 fucking cents all right i know what you're going through as far as  that shit it's just completely fucked up 92 cents so yeah yeah so the piece of paper they gave me  was worth a thousand shares uh all toilet paper is worth more now and you were thinking that's about 
[00:34:00]  twenty thousand large for you there i'm like i'm like i'm cashing in yeah and now it's uh worth uh  nine hundred twenty dollars congratulations oh yeah that was like a year ago could have been worse  well toilet paper is worth more now could have been worse you could have been working for enron  yeah there you go work clear channel all right thank you buddy all right and one more and then jimmy has  something there john in jersey go ahead john yeah i was just going to say why are we listening to  anthony talk about ipos after i've been listening ever since the any w days back in 99 2000 he was 
[00:34:30]  getting hammered dead what did he say i did very well until the bubble burst you did i did great until  the bubble burst i was up about 90 g's yeah anthony was day trading during the radio show and he was up  90 000 at one point and then lost it all and then you know the bubble burst and everybody lost a lot  of money on that one yeah all right john now i play in the poker market you know what it's probably uh 
[00:35:00]  yeah your odds are better probably yeah it's more legitimate of course it is jerry damn ipo  i just had to say there in this this is a good article actually in rolling stone about satellite  but eric logan always gives good quotes oh boy oh we got oh boy dude no this is hold on what page  is it on uh second page all right get out your dittos everybody uh this is our big boss at xm  satellite radio eric logan you know what it is i like logan because he says like pretty he takes  chances he says some outrageous things and i just was really amazed that he kind of brought this point 
[00:35:30]  up which i thought was pretty intuitive it says still executives of both companies acknowledge that  their most popular uh stations tend to be their mainstream offerings and then logan says  if you have a hit driven channel people are going to hang out there  i read that and it just jumped off the page at me it's like he's right i'm pissed off we gave a lot  better quotes than that wow our quotes got bumped for that one anthony oh right here too there's more  of it all right and he said when you're done listening you hit the power button and the noise 
[00:36:00]  stops coming out of the speakers oh this guy's good that's pretty funny so a little mention in  rolling stone magazine is not gonna hurt us that's pretty cool all right ah we found listen  a listenership in the cars goes up when people are driving them says eric logan says eric logan  hey this guy doesn't miss anything no wonder rolling stone grabbed him he gives you the skinny 
[00:36:30]  skinny and we got a quickie here i mean the email's going crazy in the phone so we should uh  we should just do this and get it over with and move on with the radio show but uh uh howard is at  it again he's at it again we've been telling you guys for a very long time that this guy he rips off  every dj not every dj in america but he rips off a lot of radio guys and then claims that everyone's  ripping him off and he's starting to get really really lazy as far as uh how he does it really lazy yep he 
[00:37:00]  used to uh you know find better copies of uh other jocks material but now he's just playing stuff from  other radio shows right from other radio shows we've been on to this for many many years you know  there was a gag order when we were working for the same company as him because you know we were on to  his game he does uh rip off a lot of radio guys across america people ask a lot on the uh instant  feedback and message boards why do they talk about howard why do they bother because we went 
[00:37:30]  for you know four years or so where we couldn't because he went to the boss and told the bosses to  shut us up to uh not allow us to to mention him and when you want to point out the um hypocrisy that  goes on over there and you can't it gets frustrating so now we have the ability to point these things  out and since he was such a scumbag to us when we worked for the same company we're just uh you know 
[00:38:00]  exposing him for what he is which is a phony right so i guess he uh got the bright idea to play this kkk  song yesterday called uh candy man yeah and uh you know we we played that song years ago uh as part of  something called the most offensive song contest most offensive song which was a great great radio  bit a great bit talk about cringe radio that we were never able to do again on commercial radio i  mean we got so much well we got a lot of trouble we really did i don't want to exaggerate the point 
[00:38:30]  but we really did and they said do not do that again fcc violations and oh yeah and the the search  was on for the most offensive song okay yeah the the whole contest itself was was awful it was uh make  songs record songs and send them in and the most offensive song will win the the contest so you're  getting songs about just the most heinous awful subject matter uh pedophiles racism uh songs about 
[00:39:00]  the holocaust yeah just awful stuff camp concentration comes to mind camp concentration  the weird part is if someone has a cd of uh of all the songs that we played i mean that thing is very  valuable yeah it has never popped up on any of the fan sites for some reason no reason i don't know  what happened with that because they have everything else we've ever done the whole object was to find  the most offensive song so of course the songs are going to offend and then we had a uh live broadcast  in front of i guess a couple thousand people uh-huh maybe more where these people were performing some 
[00:39:30]  of their songs yes and uh you know then we got black bounces all over the place and and these guys are  singing the most racist songs from the stage yeah just crazy stuff that was rough so um all right  yeah well eric i need to go back though you can find out later actually danny found all the all the  songs though oavirus.com has it oh wow okay oavirus.com has all the songs there you go fedex does a great 
[00:40:00]  job at that site for the new listeners it's like all our old shows and our old bits on one website  yeah you want to catch up spend the night in front of that uh website yes jimmy little girls is one  of the first what was that by q i'm on a little girl yeah i remember that one of those little girls  have hairless little twats that was one of the line you don't have that uncensored just the most  offensive we could probably collection of songs i'd love to hear that we could probably play a lot of  these songs just to show you what uh what we did you know commercial radio at least that i remember 
[00:40:30]  hearing that like i remember where i was when i heard it actually driving north on 10th avenue it was like  that 9-11 and the jfk assassination are the things in american history you know exactly where you are  i was on 10th avenue in the 40s well that was the song we got in huge trouble for oh actually we got  an sec fine for that right yeah or they they wanted to find they wanted to find probably still in  litigation probably we have a few cases stolen litigation no actually um are we all cleared  off oh that's when they did the they did that huge massive payoff just to get the we're all cleared 
[00:41:00]  up well that's good to clear up all the all the violations buy more property and uh you know we set  up the bit by saying these songs are absolutely the worst this is part of the most offensive song  contest we understand this is offensive yep whatever so uh lazy howard is now just taking  actual uh you know audio from our show and playing it on his show now this isn't even a copy of the song  this is a copy of the song being played on our show so you'll hear me laughing in the background 
[00:41:30]  yeah this this was our show it's a clip of our show not just the recording of the song right and  steve uh has a little info on this i guess steve from foundrymusic.com what's up steve yeah if you  listen you can hear i mean yeah yeah you'd have to listen closely but you can tell that this is a real  audio file that came off of something we put up years ago years ago and because you because of all  because of the way it's uh it's compressed and it's it's lifted right off the website absolutely 
[00:42:00]  shut up shut up shut up shut up  so uh if you're a new listener of the show you you probably wouldn't even recognize anthony laughing  but uh the hardcore fans will obviously hear anthony laughing here and if you're in your work environment  turn your radio down yeah yeah this could get you in trouble yeah if you're driving above 100th street  in uh new york city you might want to roll your windows you might want to go to hank's place or  something right now oh yeah hank's place real good up there too yeah exactly all right here it is from 
[00:42:30]  yesterday's show howard getting very lazy now with his uh taking bits from other shows all right this  one's called uh the ku klux plan to the candy man  all right everybody gather around the ku klux plans here what kind of niggas you want burn niggas  hang niggas nappy head niggas concrete niggas and cement shoes anything you want you come to the right  man 
[00:43:00]  there you go cool  I don't think so.  Good job, Howie.  Good job.  You can hear the inappropriate bell.  I know.  You can hear the inappropriate bell. 
[00:43:30]  Because, Anthony, when we get freaked out, we go, oh, my God, and then ring the inappropriate  bell.  Inappropriate bell.  You can hear it in the background.  Clear as day.  I mean, I could see lifting the song, but, Jesus, lifting it right from our show with  us in the background.  Jeez, man.  And then claiming that everyone rips you off.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  There you go.  I've done it all.  Tell him, Fred.  There you go.  One for us today, Howie.  One for us.  And it will continue.  Tell him, Fred.  All on the radio rips me off.  All on the radio rips me off. 
[00:44:00]  All on the radio rips me off.  All on the radio rips me off.  See, he yells and screams and says that over and over again so he can get away with doing  what he did yesterday.  That's how it works in his mind.  All right, and we've got to take our first break.  All right.  And then we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  They're not paying attention in there, though.  Oh.  I just love a drive in the country laughing with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 9-1-1.  All right, you're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:45:00]  Thanks for checking us out, guys.  Greatly appreciate it.  If you like what you're hearing, you tell your friends, and that's how this thing's going  to grow every day.  Every single day.  Like the dope.  Like the dope.  You just tell your friends about it. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, this stuff's pretty good.  Try it.  I'm looking at the front pages of the newspapers here in New York.  Yeah.  We might have to do neighborhood news today, Anthony.  Really?  Maybe a little later.  Yeah, because it's a slow news day here in New York.  Like the front page of the New York Post, you know, that you're expecting a wham-bam of  a story.  One of those big sensational New York Post headlines.  They had to split the front page.  Yeah, the first half is exclusive screening of Star Wars.  They're going to give out 400 free tickets.  Oh, you know that nothing has happened in the news when that's half of your big front page 
[00:46:00]  headline.  And Bridget Jones weds Zellweger.  What's going on in Hollywood?  Wasn't she, Zellweger, wasn't she going out with Jack, Jack White or whatever from, Jack,  what the hell is his name?  Jack Black or Jack White?  Jack White.  From the White Stripes.  White Stripes.  I just realized there's a Jack White and there's a Jack Black.  Jack Black.  It confused the hell out of me, Anthony.  Yeah, Jack White.  She was going out with Jack White?  Like last month. 
[00:46:30]  Really?  Well, she just met this country guy and they just came out public at the end of April.  And boom, they're married.  I'm starting to get the feeling that they don't really take their relationships seriously  in Hollywood.  Whoa!  I don't want to get outrageous here, but...  You stop that.  You said Eric Logan of XM Satellite Radio.  Renee Zellweger was going out with Jack White.  It seemed like yesterday.  Well, now she's married to some country guy.  Yeah, what's his name?  What?  Kenny Chesney. 
[00:47:00]  Kenny what?  Kenny Chesney.  Kenny who cares?  What?  Kenny Chesney?  Kenny Chesney.  He's a big deal.  Hey, hey, hey, whoa.  You don't want to step on your toes, Eric.  He's a big deal.  He's a big deal.  He's no Paula Abdul, but we like showing our ignorance on this show.  I've never heard the guy's name in my life.  As far as country music goes, I don't really have a clue.  And this guy, apparently, Eric, a big country star?  He's been admiring her from afar for many years, and I guess they dated like two weeks and now 
[00:47:30]  they're married.  Well, Opie, he's been admiring her from afar for a few years.  And he wrote a song that was inspired by her.  This is what I read from the movie Jerry Maguire.  It was You Had Me at Hello is one of his songs.  Ugh.  Is that true?  It's got to just be this awful sap.  I thought the song was titled, You Give Good Head.  We'll lose weight after that second movie, Faxo.  Yeah, stop gaining weight and losing weight and gaining weight and losing weight. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God, how did you lose all the weight after the movie?  Shut up.  If I had a personal trainer.  Yeah.  Is this the You Had Me at Hello?  This is a real song?  This is the one that was inspired by her a few years ago, and now he's married to her.  A dream come true, Opie.  They sure do, Anthony.  They sure do.  Myer's a one word, and that's all you said. 
[00:48:30]  That's a good singer.  Something in your voice caused me to turn my head.  Stop whining.  Ah, it all starts this way, doesn't it, Anthony?  You find that special person.  You have a song together.  You're having sex all over the apartment.  And I don't know how to do it.  All day and all night.  There you go.  Your work is suffering because you, quite frankly, aren't sleeping anymore. 
[00:49:00]  You're having so much sex.  You're just giving us.  If I always will.  Until then you had me crying hello, I've got a love star.  Oh, all of that I looked into your eyes.  You want me.  It was over from the start.  You completely stoke my heart.  And now you won't let go. 
[00:49:30]  I never even had a chance, you know.  You had me from hello.  Hi.  It was hello there, not hi.  Hi.  It was Arnold's hello.  It would have been funny if you said hello.  Hi.  It was hi.  Inside.  No, I can hear a good one.  Then the sex gets more boring. 
[00:50:00]  So you spiked it up with some queefing and laughing, Anthony.  That's kind of amazing.  You're a woman.  Wow, this is going to be a huge hit, huh? 
[00:50:30]  I think it's old.  I don't know.  You know what's psychotic about this?  He liked her for years.  It kind of gives you hope as a guy if you're a country singer and a millionaire.  Right.  And they met in January and began dating at the end of last month.  That's what I'm saying.  Now they're married.  Just a few weeks ago.  They don't take their relationship seriously in Hollywood. 
[00:51:00]  And then people go, you know, how long do you think it'll last?  Oh, don't say that.  Why?  The Hollywood track record?  Have you seen it?  Especially these marriages that go after a month going out.  And then the other one is like Bennifer.  Oh, God.  I thought Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were still going out.  Because that seems just like yesterday, doesn't it?  Ah, yes.  Well, now she's married to that Mark Anthony guy. 
[00:51:30]  And now Ben Affleck has knocked up Jennifer Garner.  Yeah.  What happened to the love that was there?  Oh, that's gone now.  That was old love.  Old love, what?  Six months ago?  Yeah, that's old love.  Wasn't Jennifer Lopez sitting at Fenway during the playoffs?  That was a mere five, six months ago.  I don't remember.  And then they break up and then she runs and gets married right away.  And then he goes and bangs up Jennifer Garner.  They just seem needy, you know? 
[00:52:00]  They're a little needy.  These are people that can't really go out maybe to a local hangout or other places to meet people.  The only people they meet are really other showbiz people.  Yep.  And they're very needy.  So they hook up and when it's a good thing, they're like, oh my God, this is it.  Because they can't imagine having to then go through the whole searching process and, you know, casting with other people and banging them.  And so they get married. 
[00:52:30]  It's ridiculous.  Well, it's hard.  You know, you try to live like a normal life and you have all these people around.  Yeah, Jim, how is that?  Well, you know, I was just saying that you meet celebs and that's just what you do.  Yeah.  You kind of intermingle.  How do you ask them for a date?  Do you put your hand on their arm and go, Bob?  Hey.  Renee.  And then here's a really fast one.  We were supposed to talk about this yesterday.  Bill Clinton puts the moves on Brendan Fraser's wife.  What was that about, Anthony? 
[00:53:00]  They were doing some kind of fundraiser.  And Brendan Fraser and his wife walk in and Secret Service is there searching everybody.  And apparently Brendan Fraser's wife is a very hot, buxom, blonde type.  And Clinton looks over and sees Secret Service like patting him down and trying to search him and kind of waved him off like, oh, no, don't you worry about that.  You send them over here.  And the wife walks up and he just starts picking up on Brendan Fraser's wife, giving her the smooth Clinton lines. 
[00:53:30]  A few times Brendan Fraser said he looked over because it was something like Clinton asked the Secret Service to send her over.  But they were still kind of searching Brendan Fraser, which would really piss me off.  Oh, well, they're in cahoots together.  Of course.  Clinton's like, get her over here.  You keep the guy occupied.  Yeah, you take your time with him.  I'm going to keep him occupied.  So she was, our face was turning red a few times because he was complimenting her and, you know, putting the smooth Clinton moves on the chick. 
[00:54:00]  Could you imagine what's going on inside?  Brendan Fraser's like.  He's like, I'm Brendan Fraser.  I do this.  He's going through.  I do this.  He's going through the metal detectors over and over again.  And then he sees his wife over there getting closer and closer with Clinton.  Mr. Fraser, could you walk back through?  Like nothing.  There's some guy hitting a button underneath to make it beep.  Right.  Did you empty your pockets out?  Take your shoes off.  Take your socks off. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, no.  You're going to have to remove that belt.  Clinton's got his arm around his wife walking her away into a closed room.  He's being brought behind a curtain and his belt's being undone for a real cavity search.  Because you can't just bolt from the Secret Service, guys.  Yeah.  Hey, that's my wife over there with the president.  You know, the one that's getting felt up right now.  Yeah.  Can we hurry it up?  Puts his arm around.  And then before he closes the door, he kind of peeks over at him and goes, hey, how you doing?  Yeah, you'll be in here soon. 
[00:55:00]  Don't worry.  Oh, just you can imagine the panic that's going through you.  It's Brendan Fraser.  He's used to doing that, you know.  He's used to being at places where he's the big guy.  And, you know, other guys, chicks are with him.  And he could pick them up, you know.  But there's Clinton just making him look like an ass, moving in on his wife.  And he finally got in, got next to them both, and was just so annoyed that him and his wife left. 
[00:55:30]  It was too much.  Clinton was making the moves on his wife.  He couldn't take it.  Well, what do you do?  Like, Clinton, I mean, you don't trump Clinton as far as getting laid.  Even Tom Cruise, Clinton is hitting on your wife.  You're in trouble.  You're in deep trouble.  He's a handsome ex-leader of the free world.  He's got the power base thing going, especially then.  He was still president.  This is, like, a while back.  Oh, I thought this was recently.  No, this was a while back.  He was just telling the story of what happened.  That Brendan Fraser should shut his face in mediocre films.  You think that would be something you should shut up about, though? 
[00:56:00]  Absolutely.  You should have grabbed her hair and forced it into his lap.  It's the guy that might protect us.  Unzip his fly for him?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  It's all yours.  Should have been a real man and confronted the president.  Yeah.  Hey, asshole.  Yeah, like a barroom scene with just two idiots and their chick.  You looking at something, faggot?  Get in the fucking car.  Next thing you know, once again, you're waking up in a hospital room with Christmas music playing.  Yeah, Secret Service. 
[00:56:30]  It just doesn't know.  Boom!  Yeah, right.  Ring, ding, ding, ding, ding.  What happened?  Yeah, there is no Trump in the...  Nah, look, no.  Because he's a handsome guy.  I mean, it's like women just...  And from what I hear, I don't know.  Daryl Hammond has met him and sat with him.  And Daryl has told me that they've sat in, like, the Oval Office working on bits together.  Really?  Yeah.  And he said he's amazingly charismatic.  He's like, you see, Clinton does this thing where he invades your space.  Oh, I know.  I know all about it, Jimmy.  When I met President Clinton, I got that same feeling.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:57:00]  Did you?  Yeah.  When I got that picture last summer, I got to tell you, yeah, he takes over the space.  Oh, that's right.  What space?  Oh, the alley you sandbagged him in?  He did take that over.  So I can relate to what you're saying now, Jimmy.  Yes.  The alley you sandbagged him in.  There's just something about his presence.  Magnetism.  I want to talk about it.  When you're asking for a picture, you know?  Jimmy is very big on getting pictures of famous people, obviously.  And Opie kind of trumped him because Opie has the Bill Clinton photo, the photo with Bill Clinton. 
[00:57:30]  Not only that, I have my arm around him.  Yeah?  You do?  Tight.  So he doesn't leave before that picture was taken.  That's a good one.  That's what I'd love to have.  That's a huge one right there.  I had a picture, and I'm such a dope as a kid, you know?  I moved so much and ended up in so many hovel apartments that I just lost things.  I had a picture with Groucho Marx.  Jesus.  Wow.  How old are you?  No, it's right before he dropped dead. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, my God, dude.  Was it like 1975 or something?  I was a kid.  You've been petting your age all these years, haven't you?  I was a kid.  How old are you?  El Duque, where were you when you actually...  Jesus.  Jesus.  He's Cuban.  I was a kid.  Yeah, but someone do the math.  If Groucho Marx was alive today, he would have to be 115 if he was alive today.  Someone get his birthday.  Where were you, dude?  I'm going to an internet movie database.  Where'd you meet him?  On Groucho.  It was some event in California called A Day at the Races, and it was a star-studded event 
[00:58:30]  of horse racing and fun.  And you saw the photo?  I was in the photo.  It was me.  I crouched down.  I was a little kid.  But I crouched down and was next to his wheelchair that they were wheeling him in, snapped the  picture, and signed an autograph, too.  He was born in 1890.  1890?  I met some guy born in 1890.  Were you 70?  Wow. 
[00:59:00]  An autograph?  I shook a hand of a guy that probably shook hands with somebody that was in the Civil War.  That is messed up.  That is really fucking weird.  You got a picture with Groucho Marx, and it took two or three people to get the picture  taken.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a big flash of gunpowder.  That's right.  The guy had to get under the whatever they used to do under the curtain.  Under the curtain or whatever.  That cloth thing that you've got to cover your head with?  He was 85.  Yeah.  That photographer?  Ansel Adams, Opie. 
[00:59:30]  He was the one that actually took the picture.  You're an old guy.  You've been petting your age.  No.  When did he die?  77.  77.  So it was the year before he died.  It was 1976.  I thought we would do this hip show together.  Two hip guys, young guys, in the demo.  You're like old.  Yeah, that's what it was.  I actually did movies with him back in the 30s.  Anthony, he was born in 1890.  1890.  That is something, though.  That's pretty cool. 
[01:00:00]  You got an autograph and a picture, and you lost them both?  Yeah.  That's going to make me sick.  It makes me sick when I think about it.  It does.  It might be somewhere.  No.  Dude, I am talking.  It was gone years ago.  I bet you there's a homeless guy with a nice picture of you and Groucho Marx.  My autograph and my picture.  Where would it be?  What would you do with it?  Did you frame it?  No, it didn't mean shit to me back then.  Oh, okay.  So it was like, who cares, you know?  That's like my Christmas card from Richard Nixon, too. 
[01:00:30]  I had a Christmas card from Richard Nixon.  I sent him a Christmas card, because I was a big Nixon fan back when I was a kid.  He sent me a box with 18 minutes of tape in it and a little card.  I don't know what happened.  I lost that.  Can you imagine?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  1890?  1890, yeah.  That's insane.  You know how many president's hands he shook?  Oh, my God.  Groucho.  It was Groucho.  He looked like he was dead already in that wheelchair. 
[01:01:00]  He was covered up, his legs covered up in a blanket.  He had a caretaker wheeling him around.  And he would just, you know, they kind of put paper in front of him, and he signed it.  Groucho.  All right.  Took the picture with a Polaroid camera.  One of the funniest men ever.  Yeah.  I mean, he's right up there with the guys from Yes Deer and a few other things I've seen.  Let's say hi to Rick in Minnesota.  Rick.  How's it going?  How are you, buddy?  Not too shabby.  How are you doing there, sweet bang? 
[01:01:30]  Fine.  But don't ever say shabby again, sir.  It's 2005.  Shabby.  I had some wacky radio, but they just got down with this bit, but they're coming up with  the sports.  They talked to a local news anchor, sports anchor, and they always rip on him, and he  always comes back with good rips back at them.  All right.  That was kind of funny.  All right.  Well, this call is useless then.  I'm sorry.  No, but I wanted to know, what did they say to each other?  I don't know. 
[01:02:00]  Anything and everything.  Well, like, will the anchor say something?  Shut up, Jerry.  Shut up, Jerry.  Shut up.  Wait.  Shut up.  Does the anchor say it first, or does the weather fail?  Shut up.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, you fancy people?  Hey.  How are you doing today?  Hi.  Fancy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Did you realize that Anthony has one picture that beat your Clinton picture?  He's got a picture with FDR.  You didn't know that?  FDR.  Shut up.  The listeners are taking over, Anthony.  I do not have a picture with FDR. 
[01:02:30]  This is never good when the listeners decide to take over.  Seth in Boston.  What's up, Seth?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Anthony, have you ever mentioned that you are an extra in the Little Rascals back in the  30s?  Little Rascals.  Shut up.  I was not.  It was 1976.  I met Groucho Marx.  It just doesn't look good, Anthony.  Then you have a picture with a guy.  Diane Carroll was there.  Artie Johnson from Ronan Martin's Laughin'.  Wow.  He was there. 
[01:03:00]  Alice Cooper was there.  Alice Cooper.  Who's she?  Who was that chick?  And who was changing his diapers while you were getting the picture taken with Groucho?  With Groucho?  No.  He had handlers.  He had peeps.  Yeah, look.  See?  That kind of looks like he looked.  Hello.  Dragon Wagon, what's up?  Oh, I just had a little bone to pick.  I got rid of my ex, Tim.  Dragon Wagon, can I tell you something?  You know your 15 minutes is up.  You did great for us.  We had a lot of fun at your expense. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, thank you.  But goodbye.  Done.  Hell, that annoys the hell out of him right there.  He's done.  He thought he was going to be a big star on the Open Anthony program.  I'm the Dragon Wagon.  You know that?  I wonder if he's a fan of the show or if he's just trying to be like the edgy guy.  Well, now he's going to have to, you know, let us know if he's a fan of the show because  he's done.  Done.  I got a bone.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was just wondering why nobody else has figured out that Anthony's actually a vampire. 
[01:04:00]  I'm a vampire.  Well, you got me now.  All right.  I'm punching out.  Eight mornings.  Yeah.  I'm a night person.  Just a little weird, Anthony.  That's all.  It is weird when you, you know, put it in that kind of context of a guy that was born  in 1890.  1890 to have met him.  I know.  He's there.  He, he, Civil War people.  People that had fought in the Civil War could have, you know, known him. 
[01:04:30]  My dad had old home movies when he was a kid and stuff where he had like, you know, a grandfather,  you know, around a Christmas tree with his brothers or whatever.  And you start doing the math going, those people were born like in 1860 or something.  Yeah.  And they're on film with my dad.  Yeah.  And now we're, you know, up to the year 2005.  So, you know, just a couple generations removed from these guys that were born in 1860 or whatever  it was. 
[01:05:00]  How about if Groucho.  That's crazy.  Like, that's when Lincoln was around.  How about if Groucho was held as a child by somebody that was 90 years old?  You know, then you're talking 1700s.  Then I had contact with one person who may have had contact with somebody from the 1700s.  That really is fucked up.  That's true.  But how about if you died when you were seven and then that would have been the end of the  little lineage?  Then it's just gone. 
[01:05:30]  1700s, though.  But yeah, Groucho, I don't think anyone was 90 years old in 1860.  They had plenty of them old codgers back there.  They all died young.  They had a cold.  They were finished.  Powdered wigs.  They got the typhus.  She died of consumption.  What kind of diseases was that?  I got a touch of the vapors.  What is consumption, Anthony?  Consumption?  Yeah.  The tuberculosis?  I don't know.  I think the consumption was tuberculosis.  Oh, okay.  Check that out.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  I'm going to look.  The consumption.  Tea on.  I spelled it wrong.  There we go.  Now, behind consumption, alcohol consumption, obsessive consumption.  How about coffee consumption?  Can an intern come in so I can engage in some of that?  That would be nice.  Where's Travis to go?  Travis, where's that kid?  We're going to lose Travis because Washington doesn't get it.  Yes, consumption is creepy.  How are you going to lose Travis? 
[01:06:30]  We've got to pay him or something for him to stay here, and we've still got two other  guys we've got to start paying.  How come those guys are able to stay here and Travis isn't?  I have no idea.  Not that I want those guys gone.  I mean, it's hard to find really good people that are going to help this show, and we might  have to say goodbye to him.  Uh-oh.  No, they're not getting it down in Washington.  There's a guy that wants to hang out and work for free until we figure it out, and they  won't let him.  They won't let him.  What are they saying?  What's their reasoning?  I have no idea.  It just doesn't make any sense.  I'd like a coffee, please.  Anybody else?  Cup of Joe? 
[01:07:00]  A cup of Joe?  A cup of Joe?  No.  Sweetie wants a little something?  Take his order?  Bill needs coffee.  I'm all right.  All right.  You guys want to hear a voicemail from the Gregster?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is...  All right.  By the way, I'm not checking Ant's taint for his age.  No.  I'm not even taking that phone call.  Check his taint.  Check his taint.  Jesus, the phones have exploded.  Okay. 
[01:07:30]  Someone said vampires are very fashionable.  Yeah, I'm dressing like Lestat.  I'm coming in with my comfy sleeves.  You found a Groucho Marx bit on the master computer?  There's tons of them.  No kidding.  All right.  All right.  I would love to hear an outrageous Groucho Marx bit.  Did it get a little racy back in the day?  Let's see.  With titles such as Hooray for Captain Spaulding.  I owe a money and I'm dodging it. 
[01:08:00]  Hollywood Agents.  Go West, young man.  Blackstrap Molasses.  Oh, there is some good humor.  I want to know what Hollywood Agents is.  Is it dirty?  I'm sure it's just awful.  Drops a C-bomb.  Drops a C-bomb.  Okay.  Yeah, this recording?  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  The Gregster.  The Gregster.  Reminded me of something I saw online.  Somebody posted this video of this girl.  Seems like a high school chick.  I don't know.  And she's talking to her buddy, her boyfriend or ex-boyfriend, Matt,  right into the video camera.  And I guess he broke up with her.  And she's saying how he's missing out.  And she wants to show Matt her sexual side.  And she starts taking her clothes off.  And she gets completely naked.  Puts the camera down by her gash. 
[01:09:00]  And starts plunging her fingers in a very unsexy fashion.  And saying how she'll do anything for him.  Begging.  Psycho chick.  And this is like psycho guy.  Why can't we get that audio on the show today?  We've got to get that audio.  Why can't we get that video to yellowtrees at AOL.com?  It's on Whackbag.  Well, if it's on Whackbag, can we get the audio, Eric, right away?  We've got to hear that on the show today.  Consumption is an old name for tuberculosis.  It describes how the illness wastes away or consumes its victim. 
[01:09:30]  It is an ancient enemy that has plagued humankind for more than 5,000 years.  Consumption or tuberculosis.  Or tuberculosis.  You don't get the theme song today?  No.  Because you read that one.  I know.  But he did kind of know it, didn't he?  I did say it was consumption was TB.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  I just wasn't absolutely sure that it was.  Jeremy from North Carolina.  Jeremy?  Hey.  How you guys doing? 
[01:10:00]  Pretty good.  Hey, man.  Good.  I want to know how many slaves Anthony owns.  Bunch of jackasses.  It doesn't look good, Anthony.  No.  I think you've been padding your age just a little bit.  Jesus.  Let's go to Randy in New York.  Randy!  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Let's go.  I just figured out why Ant is always watching the History Channel.  Why?  He likes watching all the people he's met.  Alright.  You want to get into the Gregster's voicemail here? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  I guess the Gregster...  By the way, my real name's Greg, and I've never used the name the Gregster ever.  Any time you put the stir thing at the end of your name...  The Gregster.  That is really sad.  It's really awful.  What's your name?  Gang.  Gangster.  Very good.  Does anyone really do that, though?  Put the stir at the end?  Yeah.  People were doing that for a while until, what's his name, exploited that on SNL.  Oh, SNL.  The copy guy.  Who was the copy guy?  Rob Schneider. 
[01:11:00]  Rob Schneider.  I can't stand to laugh at.  But with his dopey movies, when you put them on at night, you just can't help but laugh at them.  I hate that.  I do not want to find him funny.  But he's awful in every Adam Sandler movie, because they're friends.  Oh, but it's hysterical.  Come on.  You can do it!  He is awful in every Adam Sandler movie.  But then he goes off and does his own thing, and there's some funny, funny scenes.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, the Gregster, I guess he met this girl, and he thought there was some potential there. 
[01:11:30]  They exchanged numbers, and I guess she possibly even promised that she would call him or something.  Hmm.  He's hooked on her, and just, he's psycho.  Yeah, so let's just play the voicemail, and we'll stop it as we go here.  Mm-hmm.  Save the messages, Thursday, 9, 31 p.m.  You're so fucking nice.  Laura, it's Greg, you know, the guy that you were going to get back with to let me know if you were going to see me.  Going to get back with letting me know if you were going to see me. 
[01:12:00]  So it doesn't sound like get back with like they were going out.  God.  Like he means getting back like a phone call?  Get back to.  That's what it seems like, yeah.  The girl was letting him off the hook easy.  Yeah.  You've got to be able to read the girl.  It's, you know, she didn't get in touch with you.  It's over, Jim.  She didn't want to say, I have no interest whatsoever.  So she's like, well, I'll get back to you.  Nothing happened.  I'd still like to know, you know, tomorrow's Friday.  But you know what? 
[01:12:30]  It's okay if you're not up to it.  You know, you've got other plans, obviously.  Okay.  I'll be in touch.  You know, we'll give it one more shot and we'll see what happens.  You know, it'll be a shame if you don't give me a chance, so that's for sure.  And like I say, I'm not, you know, I'm not looking for a romance, you know, but we can have fun.  It's up to you. 
[01:13:00]  But then again, this is not good.  You told me you'd call me and you didn't.  So evidently I guess this would be some kind of sign.  You could just be blatant if you want to be blatant.  But I'll see you.  And you know what?  Like I say, if you don't go out with me, it's your loss anyways, Laura.  I like you.  You're cool.  But you ain't all that, okay?  Smooth.  You could return my call.  That doesn't put you high in my ranks of being civil. 
[01:13:30]  I know.  I mean, if the shoe was on either foot, I'd at least have the respect to do that for now.  But I guess that's the difference between us.  I'll fuck.  Go later.  Bye.  Oh, God.  What are you doing, Grace?  You're not all that.  Then he turns on her, figures that, yeah, I'll play a little hard to get.  I'll make her a little angry.  That's going to really get her to want to go out with me. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, this guy's got it bad.  What a douche.  What an idiot.  Hope Laura had him killed.  By the way, real fast, Anthony, someone needs to email the link to Steve or Eric.  That video you were talking about?  Yeah.  I'm not sure if it's illegal or not, so I don't know.  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm sure the audio of it would be really good to get, but...  Oh, they pulled it off the site?  It's not off there.  It's not on the site?  I mean...  I've heard rumor that she isn't underage, that she is. 
[01:14:30]  Who knows, but...  Always better to be safe than sorry.  That's right.  That's what I say, Anthony.  Well, that just woke Jimmy up.  Yeah.  Jimmy saw ticket sales plummeting and merchandising going down.  God, Jimmy was laid back nice, just relaxing, reading the paper.  Dreaming about his coffee that's about to arrive any moment, and that piped you right back  up.  Yeah.  You're sitting straight up again.  Yeah, we should just leave that alone.  We do want this job for a while.  Yeah.  Pull the audio off of it, though. 
[01:15:00]  It's pretty cool.  Okay.  I can't get in trouble for the audio.  How do you know?  I don't.  Well, it's audio you're playing.  It's audio.  I mean, if you're playing it as a news thing, you're not...  We don't know anything about it.  First of all, I've never heard of anyone getting in trouble, like, as far as criminal  charges, for playing audio of any type of illegal pornography.  You know?  I've never heard of that.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Ever hear of a bust go down because audio was being played? 
[01:15:30]  Obster?  Ah, let's go for it.  Back in the olden days, I remember one time we were listening to some illegal pornography  audio on the Victrola.  Yeah.  And some revenuers came running in and bashed everything apart with sledgehammers.  What the hell is revenuers?  I don't know.  Something they did in black and white times.  The tax man showed up with a hat and a suit.  They hit our still with an axe and left us broke.  All we had was the whiskey left in the bathtub. 
[01:16:00]  Alright, well, the Gregster left another message on this girl's voice.  Another message.  Gregster wasn't done.  He's very desperate.  Saved message, Thursday, 9, 38 p.m.  Yes, it's Greg again, Laura.  It'd be nice if you'd call and at least let me know if we're on for tomorrow or not.  I'd appreciate it.  You know, that's just not right, man. 
[01:16:30]  You know, at least you kick it with me and we have a good conversation and everything.  You just like, you know, like are totally irresponsible.  I don't care what you're doing right now.  And you know what?  I'm sure.  I'm going to blow my own horn again.  But you know what?  I'm sure I'm better than what you're dating.  So, hey, you're lost again, okay?  You could have had at least the dignity and the respect and courtesy to call me tonight. 
[01:17:00]  I'll get back with you in a few days.  Instead, you take a coward's way out if you don't want to see me.  Hey, believe me, I'm not in a mole that often, but I can forget where you work there real easy.  You know, if that's what you want, that's not a problem.  I thought you were at least a civil chick, you know?  I thought you were a decent person at least.  But I guess impressions, no matter how conclusive they are, they can be wrong, obviously. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, but like I say, you ain't all that girl.  You're hot.  I'd like to get with you like I told you.  Basically, that's my only motive anyway.  I'm not looking for anything of any validity or substance with you.  This guy is good.  That's all I'm looking for.  Just get angry and tell you I just want to fuck her.  I just want to fuck you.  You're not really all that, but he was dreaming of a life together with kids, a picket fence outside. 
[01:18:00]  You're not really all that, but I'd throw you one.  I'd like to fuck you in the mouth.  Yeah.  Well, it seems he met her at the mall, I guess.  She works at the mall, and I guess they had a little conversation.  So she had no choice.  She had no choice.  She had to talk to him.  Yeah, hey, I'm Greg.  She's probably behind the counter at the Gap or something.  Yeah.  Hi, they call me the Gregster.  I'm Greg.  Hey, what do you say me and you maybe go out one night?  Oh, okay.  All right, look, I'm going to give you my card. 
[01:18:30]  Here's my number.  Give me a call.  All right, I'll do that.  Great, thanks.  And then he leaves.  Well, he had to get her number.  Wow, you know what?  I'll exchange numbers.  Don't want it.  Don beat me to it.  I was just thinking this.  Go ahead, Don.  Donster.  Yeah.  What's up, Donster?  It sounds like Simone from Fast Times has lost his mojo in the normal world.  It does have a little Damone to it.  Hey, Debbie.  He's got that dumb silly accent.  Isn't this great? 
[01:19:00]  It doesn't matter if she comes, stays, lays, or prays.  Your toes are still tapping.  Hey, you know what?  Kiss me.  You won't regret it.  Let's go to Don.  Another Donster on the phone.  Don.  Make it sound like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  Hey, Debbie.  Isn't this great?  Kiss me.  Kiss me. 
[01:19:30]  You won't regret it.  You won't regret it.  Hey, it does sound like Damone.  Hold on, Ann.  I'm getting something for you.  Yeah.  Which was the biggest faux pas.  Huh?  What?  In the movie.  Oh!  What?  No, that's not how you spell it silly.  H.  S-H.  S-H.  S-H.  There you go.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Come on.  Come on, Eric.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Remember the whole line about when it comes to making out? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  What do they say in the movie?  Put on side two of Zeppelin IV or something like that?  Yeah.  Something like that and then they're playing cashmere?  Yeah.  I think that's just Rat not knowing shit.  You know?  Rat never got anything right.  I don't think it's a mistake.  You know?  Rat wouldn't know.  Just, oh, this, they told me something about Zeppelin and pops it in.  I just threw one in.  He's an idiot.  It might have been a joke, like an inside joke if you're a real Zeppelin fan and you 
[01:20:30]  caught it.  Yeah.  Like he was just goofing, like it's like, you know, put on this thing and he puts on  the wrong thing.  I always wanted to know why though.  There has to be a reason.  Did you get that out of the hamper?  Thought you could use some help with your math homework on such a hot day.  You math homework.  That was funny.  Ramon ruled.  He did rule.  Don, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  The minute I heard that, you know what I started thinking of?  Do you remember the tapes from mypsychoexgirlfriend.com? 
[01:21:00]  That guy?  Yeah.  These guys would make a perfect couple for each other, man.  Yeah, that was the one with the psycho bitch.  Yeah.  Is that audio still out there?  It's gotta be.  It's gotta be on L.A. Virus, man.  Well, someone find that audio for us.  You know, for the new listeners, you gotta hear this psycho girlfriend.  You just wanna kill her.  Can we find that, Steve or somebody?  Alright, we're looking for it?  Alright.  Alright, guys, welcome back.  Punching out.  Thanks, Don.  Alright, back to the Gregster.  He left a little more here.  Okay. 
[01:21:30]  You know, I like the way you look.  And I'd like to get with you, you know?  Yeah.  Sooner or later.  And maybe that scares you.  I don't know.  Hey.  But you know what?  I don't care.  Because I'm Greg.  I'm the Gregster.  You know?  So you ain't hurting me.  It's just your loss.  That's the way I look at it.  Yeah.  Her loss.  And you'll see anyways.  In time, you'll realize that.  You won't be the first girl who's made that mistake. 
[01:22:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  And around my way, believe me, there's a few of them who wish they would have reciprocated  when the opportunity was there.  Reciprocated?  You know what?  That's okay, Laura.  I just thought you were a little cooler than you appear to be.  And now I thought you were a decent person.  Evidently, you can't even take two minutes to call me and let me know what's up.  What do you think?  I gotta beg for your attention or something? 
[01:22:30]  Well, it's a good day.  Hey, maybe you've got some puppy dogs that you're running around with with little tails  between your legs just because they think they got a shot.  But you ain't got nothing that I ain't had before.  And better.  Okay?  So, I guess we won't even talk anymore.  Okay?  Bye.  What a complete asshole.  This guy is a...  Who's laughing in the background of that though?  Do you hear that?  Yeah, I don't know. 
[01:23:00]  This guy's a classic.  What an ass.  Yeah.  I've had...  I've had better.  That's gonna get it.  The guy obviously is head over heels for this girl.  And he got a little annoyed she didn't call back.  What do you do?  Who hasn't been in that situation?  You don't make phone calls like that.  No.  Drive to the house with duct tape and some chloro-firm.  Chloro-firm.  Whenever you say it's your loss, it's not. 
[01:23:30]  It's not.  It's not.  Whenever.  Under all circumstances.  All circumstances, yeah.  That is never your loss.  I've never actually heard a person say to someone else that it's your loss where you're  like, wow, good point.  It's your loss.  Wow, you know something?  It is my loss.  Hmm.  Maybe I should reconsider.  Hey Rob, what's up?  You're a loss.  Hey, it's Rob and Sammy.  Huh?  Rob, yeah.  Hey, the whole Led Zeppelin Fast Times thing, what I heard is they couldn't get the rights  until the last second and they thought they were gonna get rights to Led Zeppelin 
[01:24:00]  4, but that was the only song they could get rights to.  Led Zeppelin didn't release rights until the almost famous soundtrack with Cameron Crowe.  Oh.  Hmm.  Yeah.  That's pretty interesting.  Yeah, punchin' out.  What happened, dude?  Hey, do we have Robert Plant on Letterman last night?  Was it on Letterman?  No?  You guys didn't like it?  Robert Plant?  Who's got pictures with Robert Plant?  Oh, I got Robert Plant too.  Oh.  Well, you know, it's funny.  It was like, I got a photo with him, of course. 
[01:24:30]  A really affectionate picture.  Yeah.  But it was fun.  We just got to sit there and watch him jam for like one song or two songs.  Yeah.  Free from where we are to you is how close he was singing.  That's it.  Yeah.  Just being open a room.  It was incredible.  His big giant head right there.  We're just bobbing along hoping that we don't make eye contact with him.  Looking down at the floor because we thought like we were going to get kicked out at any  second.  Of course.  Don't look.  Don't gaze upon him.  That was a moment.  I couldn't believe we were just sitting there.  Anthony, not even ten feet.  I mean, right there.  There was no one between us and Plant. 
[01:25:00]  Legend.  A true legend.  Absolutely.  I'm thinking we have to get kicked out of this situation.  Yeah.  Who are we to be sitting right next to Robert Plant as he's practicing a new song from his  new CD?  Which, by the way, is getting rave reviews.  Is it?  Yeah.  The new disc is getting rave reviews.  Haven't heard it.  Huh?  Haven't heard it.  It's pretty cool.  Actually, he performed a song on Letterman last night.  We might be able to give...  They're pulling it now.  What XM channel is it played on?  It's not that good?  No, but they're pulling it.  What XM channel plays the new Robert Plant?  Well, that's the problem with...  Not the problem with XM.  It's the cool thing about XM. 
[01:25:30]  It's probably on a bunch of the stations.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know which one's offhand.  Well, Eric Logan said in an interview that if someone's a Robert Plant fan and they play a Robert  Plant song, that person will probably listen to it.  I don't want to misquote them, but it was something like that.  Yeah, it was something like that.  What a waste of time when quotes like that end up in an article.  But, dude, it was like...  I had never thought of that.  I'm like, I wasn't too sure what happens if you have a station that plays all the hits.  I'm like, well, they're hits.  The people love them, so when they hear that station, they probably turn away. 
[01:26:00]  But he comes out, he says the complete opposite, and I read his point.  I'm like, you know what?  He might have a valid point there.  Sue, what's up?  Eloster.  Hey.  Hey.  Sue, sir.  Hi.  Cameron Crowe says on the commentary for Almost Famous that it's his screw up.  He's like, yeah, it's my big faux pas from Fast Times that I screwed up on the Zeppelin thing.  Why does he say that on the commentary for Almost Famous?  I'm not really sure what...  You know, I can't exactly remember the reference, but they were talking about music. 
[01:26:30]  They were talking about getting bits.  Maybe they were talking specifically at the time about Elton John, if I remember correctly,  because they...  Well, you know the commentary on a lot of these, you know, DVDs.  They go all over the place.  Yeah.  So they're probably off the cuff.  Someone asked them about it.  Yeah, it just wanders.  And he was talking about how...  He's like, yeah, it's my big screw up.  You know, the music guy.  And I screwed up.  Huh.  But how did he screw up?  No one knows that that song's not off Zeppelin 4.  I guess he didn't in the moment.  Hmm. 
[01:27:00]  Interesting.  All right.  Thank you, Sue.  Bye.  Take care.  Bye.  All right.  We should take a break.  Mm-hmm.  Ooh.  That's a good hot cup of joe.  I'll say.  I only drink Starbucks.  That's interesting.  Mm-hmm.  Let's do 20 minutes on that.  That's just Jimster.  That's just Jimster.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[01:27:30]  Long Island is very nice.  Getting into it, back and forth from the city, is a pain in the ass unless you do it when it's still dark out.  But Long Island is very pleasant.  Ugh.  How do you guys...  I drive one time out there and I wanted to...  I just wanted to cut my own throat on the O&A.  I hate it out there.  I understand the driving part, but the pleasure of living...  Do you know what a weekend is like out on Long Island?  It's wonderful.  Birds are tweeting. 
[01:28:00]  I look out my window.  Do you know what we got at the house, Opie?  Oh my God.  We got...  What the hell is happening to you?  I don't even...  A tiny little bird feeder.  And we stuck it on the back window.  And the little cardinals and birds tweet, tweet, and they grab little sunflower seeds.  And you go, oh look, there's a little Tweety bird out the window.  And the squirrels try to get to it.  But they can't jump that high. 
[01:28:30]  But gosh darn it, they try.  And they walk up and sometimes the birds drop some of the little seeds.  And the squirrels come up and eat some of the seeds.  And it's a perfect little suburban day.  You do realize you used to have threesomes, right?  Yeah, I know.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what...  I just want to wake you up a little bit.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  The birds out my back window open.  Could you hear this? 
[01:29:00]  Shoot me.  Shoot me.  You know how that should have went?  There's a little bird outside the window.  Get the bat.  I'm not saying that, you know, there aren't other things to do.  But it just conjures up...  It's that suburban living on a weekend when you're not commuting into the city or something.  It's very pleasant.  It lowers your blood pressure to...  It's wonderful.  ...to watch the birds feed.  You hear the little children playing in another yard somewhere, a few houses away. 
[01:29:30]  Maybe a dog barking in the distance.  A little dog barking.  Maybe you hear a couple of the landscapers, you know, doing a lawn down the street.  The smell of cut grass filling the neighborhood.  That's nice.  Not a black person to be seen...  Oh!  Maybe I shouldn't have gone that far.  I'm teasing, of course.  Shut up.  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:00]  It's suburban living, Opie.  Maybe a little ice cream truck.  It's the country.  Oh!  The ice cream truck is coming down the street.  And there's the little kids...  Stop!  That's the wonder of suburban living, Opie.  Out far from the city.  Oh!  Close enough to work.  But on the weekends, you just wanna remove yourself from, may I say, the hustle and bustle of city life. 
[01:30:30]  And just sit there.  Maybe I'm sitting on my back deck.  Honey!  Honey, could you get me an ice-cold iced tea?  Ah!  And then I kick back and watch the birds.  Watch the children bicycle down the street.  Watch everyone of the same race, creed, and color enjoying country life.  Perhaps you can light up a Lucky Strike cigarette. 
[01:31:00]  It's the wonders of suburban living, Jimmy.  That's why I live out on Long Island.  The commute, sure, that's a bad thing.  But it's the weekends I look forward to.  The sights and smells of wonderful country living.  That's why I do it.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  So be it. 
[01:31:30]  Threaten no more.  Let the killer pieces  To prepare for more.  So be it.  Settle the score.  Trust me again for the words that you will hear evermore.  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  Ben is, uh... 
[01:32:00]  What happened, Ben?  Farted.  Goddammit.  I see the Rolling Stones today.  I'm happy.  You haven't farted in a while.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Now we...  There's nothing.  It's a dud, too.  Yeah, I don't smell anything.  Nothing.  Ben doesn't seem to say it's a dud.  Trust me.  It's a poodle yap.  What was I going to say?  Oh, yeah, we are going to the Rolling Stones press conference today.  Yes.  That's going to be really cool.  At least you guys are.  I'm still working on you, Jim.  I'm not.  I'm trying to get you in there.  I have to sit with one of my financial guys at home.  How rich are you? 
[01:32:30]  How old are you and how rich are you?  I'm just trying to hold on to some of it.  Hold on to some of it.  It's a constant battle.  You're like standing there and there's hands coming in and you're trying to beat them away.  Beat them away.  That's what happens when you're big shots, folks.  Big shots.  Alright, here we go.  This is Robert playing the Letterman last night. 
[01:33:00]  Just a taste.  Because the CD is getting big reviews, Anthony.  Big reviews.  I'll give a listen.  And he was performing...  Oh, Shine It All Around?  This is supposed to be the breakout hit off the CD.  Just a taste.  Okay.  Let's see.  This is the land where I live.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da  This is the land where I live  And ain't it all cold 
[01:33:30]  Shake a little sunshine  Spread it all around  Sorry  And this is the love that I give  And these are the odds for the whole  I've got to wait for it to get it get in  Turn on your love light  Shining all around  Oh, turn on your love light  Shine it all around  I feel that  Turn it on your hot light  Oh, oh, oh, oh 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Shine  Oh, shine it all around  It's not bad  I like it  I'd like to dedicate this to Jimmy Norton  A little muffled, but it's not bad  I like that  It's not bad at all 
[01:34:30]  That was live?  Yeah, Letterman last night  A little taste  Good voice  I bet the studio version sounds really good  Yeah  Well, that's why I'm trying to get up here  But he's not really known for his live music  Robert Plant  His voice could never, ever cut  What they did in the studio  Are you insane?  Yes, I am insane  Now we're going to have a problem  But I do know  Now we're going to have a problem  Live, Zeppelin  I spent the weekend watching the DVD  Yeah  That came out, what, last year? 
[01:35:00]  The two-disc thing?  Yeah  Holy crap  In his prime?  No  Still couldn't cut it  He never hit all those notes  No way  You're going to lose this argument, man  The phones are going to explode  All right  Did you get the  I forgot the name of the DVD  It came out last year  It's a two-disc  Led Zeppelin Live?  Well  I think they had a  I think they had a fancier name than that, Jimmy  But  I saw the movie that's always being played  The old movie  Which one is that?  Song remains the same  Yeah, Song remains the same 
[01:35:30]  And, you know, all those songs  Where he's supposed to go up  He goes down with his voice  Ah  Or he doesn't sing it  Like, I want to hear  All the high Zeppelin vocals  That's right  He just didn't do them  I just was reading an article on him yesterday  And he pretty much hates performing Stairway to Heaven  Because it's such an effort  Yeah  Because it's just this whole big thing  But when he sits back  And maybe watches an old concert of him doing it  He kind of enjoys it 
[01:36:00]  Really?  But to get there when he's on stage  And get that song just right  He would basically, you know, lose sleep over it  Because everyone knows every little piece of that  And if you don't do it exactly like you hear it a thousand times  You're going to be like  Ah  See, he stinks  Hey, let me hear the studio version of the plant song we just played  There you go  Just a little piece  It's cooler already  This is the land where I live 
[01:36:30]  Paint it all over golden  Take a little sunshine  Spread it all around  This is the love that I give  These are the arms for the hold  Turn on your love light  Shine it all around  Turn on your love light 
[01:37:00]  Shine it all around  Shine it all around  Yeah, yeah  Shine it all around  Shine it all around  Wow, you win the argument there 
[01:37:30]  On that one  That's a much better version than what he did on Letterman last night  That's great, though  His studio stuff's always been better than his live stuff  He's 16 now or something, right?  He's old  Yeah  Uh, 56  He's old  56, according to the article I read yesterday  I never hear songs like him the first time  That's pretty good  Yeah, there's something about it that's kind of catchy  Are you older or younger than Robert Plant, Anthony?  Um, I think we share a birth  Shut up  Stephen Tampa, what's up?  Hey, O&A  What's up, Sugar Chips? 
[01:38:00]  Hey there, let's just be nice  No hurtful stuff  Hey, uh, How the West was one  Oh, thank you  Brandon XM listener  And what do you think?  I love it  No, I mean, you like the DVD?  Yeah, I sure do  I bought it a lot  Like you said  You have to go or so  And, uh  Of course, I got the  Thud's up and tattoos  All over my body  So, uh  I'm definitely a fan  So, what about the live plant  Back in the day  As opposed to the studio stuff?  Do you think he could hold the notes or not?  Uh, he could  With enough Jack Daniels  Alright, thank you  I mean, I know it's a 
[01:38:30]  It's a tough job  I think he pulled it off  When they were, you know, live  That's a good song  Is that a CD on sale yet?  Uh, tomorrow, I think  God damn it  How do we get a copy of that?  Wait, no, Tuesday they come out, right?  So, it comes out today, I guess  Do we get a copy of that?  Yeah, get Lee to send us some copies  I want a copy  I'd like a copy for Pete's sake  Quickly, Ben  This guy's bashing me  What?  It says,  Ants a moron  Plant nailed the vocals  On Song Remains the Same  Get me a goddamn live version  From Song Remains the Same  Of any  I don't care  That's how willing I am  I don't care what friggin' song it is 
[01:39:00]  That's right  You won't hear the guy singing  Get him shined it all around  Now  Calm down, man  I'm, uh, why?  I'm all edgy  Why?  I don't care which one  Zeppelin like Al Jolson now  John and Jersey  Yeah, no, I was going to say  Led Zeppelin, Robert Plant  Is after Anthony's time  He's more of an Al Jolson  Cab Calloway live  Cab Calloway  Cab Calloway  Ant was just saying  That Cab could never hold 
[01:39:30]  Minnie the Moocher live  I was going to do the same joke  But I thought it was  Manny the Mooch  No, oh, why did I have to  Open my mouth  It's a Minnie or Manny  If you would have said  Manny the Moocher  That probably would have been  The greatest thing I've ever heard  Oh, oh, very good  It is Minnie?  Oh, yeah, damn it  Do it for Manny the Moocher  The sound  That's the old  That's the old  Hoochie Coochie  See, your brilliance  Got in the way  That's how Cab laughs at you  If I would have got in first 
[01:40:00]  It would have been 20 minutes  Of you smashing me  You see that fucking  Heidi, Heidi, Heidi  Whole cup of water, man  Alright, it still works  That's great  Manny the Moocher  I got Manny on the brain  I was ready to do the same joke  And I was there with Manny the Moocher  Oh, we have a live version  Of a Zeppelin song  What song do we have?  Song remains the same  Oh, we have it?  Live version from what? 
[01:40:30]  Hold on, hold on  From what?  Don't know?  You don't know  Alright, let's hear  A little live version  People, won't you listen now  Sing along and dance  You don't know what you're missing now  Of any little song that you know  Everything that's small  Has to grow  Always grows 
[01:41:00]  Pretty good  For it, for it  Oh  A little weak there  Are we critiquing Robert Plant?  Yeah  It's like, oh, he's reaching there a little bit  What about, does everyone remember laughter?  He's got a little bit of it there  Does anyone remember laughter?  What year was this song  A man just saying  Like 76, something like that?  It was pretty much in their prime 
[01:41:30]  Yeah  Which is what?  They were like 70 to  When did Bonham die?  81 or 80  80, 81  Somewhere around there  Alright, well, you know  I mean, it's split down the middle  On the phone  Yeah  We could go to Brent in Myrtle Beach  He agrees with me  Frank on Long Island  And is nuts  But then there's other people saying  You're right  So it's just dumb  Yeah, he sings everything  On a lower key  On the live stuff, too  You'll notice it's not  It's not  It's not done in the same key 
[01:42:00]  As he does it on the albums  It's easier to sing that way  Brent, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey  Man, I totally disagree with Anthony on this  I mean, even after, you know  75 when Plant was in the car crash  He still had an amazing voice  And on that live DVD  How the West Was Won  You can listen to  Watch any part of that  And see how great that he was  Yeah, I mean, never  How the West Was Won  I don't agree  It's an amazing DVD 
[01:42:30]  Frank on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey  Alright, you gotta understand  One important thing about Plant  1975, his voice went to shit  Prior to 73  He could do anything  After that, fell apart  What kind of accent did he have?  I'm not a big Zeppelin fanatic  What kind of accent did he have, Jimmy?  No, no, no, accident  Oh, accident  His wife were in the Isles of Greece  And they had a car accident  It was a bad one?  Yeah, he lost his son, right?  His son died later on  From a disease of the lungs, guys  Yeah, he wasn't that 
[01:43:00]  What was the song he wrote about his son?  All My Love  Okay  In Through the Outdoor, 1979  Very nice  Look at this guy  Hey, hey, hey  This guy  He's one of those guys  I'm one of those guys  Slow in the driveway on Sunday, huh?  What was that, Jimmy?  Yeah  There it is  This guy  On instant feedback  Saying he lost his voice  In early 73  Like, you're getting all the dates  Yeah  This is a backhaul 
[01:43:30]  Of a high school conversation  No, dude  Smoke a joint  He lost his voice in 73  When it's all said and done  There's no band greater than Led Zeppelin  Uh-oh  Oh, boy  Look at Jimmy  Jimmy's face  Jimmy, you have to agree  That Zeppelin does  Surpass Black Sabbath  In legendary status  I just want to  They do  But I prefer Sabbath 
[01:44:00]  I enjoy Sabbath  Personally, you prefer Sabbath more  And I think Zeppelin was phenomenal  One of the greatest bands  I think the Beatles are the greatest band of all time  Nah  That's my  I would say  I would put them  Yeah  Nah  Zeppelin  Well, I  I started with Zeppelin and Sabbath, by the way  Here's why I would put  And then I went with Zeppelin more than Sabbath  In my youth  Zeppelin may have been technically better  Clad's definitely a better singer than Ozzy  And I'm sure Ozzy would say that  But I just feel Sabbath was underrated  When the comparison was made 
[01:44:30]  I think they  The fact that Sabbath's not the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Just shows me  Because it's all Rolling Stone magazine  Ozzy made a great point that day  When he was in  He said that the guy  What does Ozzy want to be nominated for?  The best bat body  Like that's this  This faggot mentality  These fucking music critics have  Yeah  They're the same motherfuckers  That vote for  For faggoty sitcoms  And movies  You know what I mean?  These are the same  The same Roger Ebert  Fucking mentality  Because he's married to a black woman  He'll never badmouth a black actor  Morgan Freeman's the best actor in Hollywood 
[01:45:00]  Is he really stupid?  Well, that stiff thing he does in every movie  He's a good actor  But he's really better than Gary Oldman  Or Philip Seymour Hoffman  You idiot  That's a brilliant  He plays the same guy in every movie  Yeah, the older narrator gentleman  Right, exactly  And he's very good  Never see him get flustered in a movie  He's always kind of straight line  Not really  Very energetic  I played a pimp in one movie 
[01:45:30]  I think it was in 79  Something with Christopher Lee  Really?  Yeah  He played Malcolm X in a film  I mean, he's done a lot of stuff  I mean, come on  Best actor  Stop  No  All right, let's go to Pete in Connecticut  Pete  Yeah, I would think you guys would be able to relate  Really well to Led Zeppelin  As far as the whole relationship with the fans  Because you know if you guys had to do your bits live  Some jackass maniac ONA fan would call up  Oh, you do  You only said fuck 19 times  We'll say 22 times  Can I point out the difference, sir?  Yes  That is 
[01:46:00]  The difference between music  And this show is a comedy show  Comedy is contingent upon taking you off guard  Music is not  That's why Stairway to Heaven  People want to hear a hundred times  But even jokes that people love  If you're doing it 20 years from now  I mean, it just loses something  Whereas a lot of times a hit song won't  It doesn't need to take you off guard  For you to love it  Well, I was hoping for a laugh there  Because I was kind of making a joke about Yoni  So thanks, Jimmy  Yeah, thanks, Jimmy  Exactly  Well, he bombs  And I go off on a 40-minute dull tangent 
[01:46:30]  Thanks for taking the guy seriously  I'm sorry, buddy  Just trying to add a little chuckle to the show  And I have to say contingent  And then just fucking put everyone to sleep  Jesus  Am I an idiot?  Pete, you're funny, man  That was great  Well, I was just going for a laugh  You're right  I'm a bore  That's funny  Hey, we got an update on the gay gym, Anthony  That we brought to everyone's attention yesterday  Ooh, the gay gym  Here in New York City  Gymnasium  Gymnasium  You want to give the back story on this from yesterday, Anthony? 
[01:47:00]  Ooh, the back story  Yeah  Oh, there's a gym in Chelsea  What's the name of the joint?  Chelsea is the big gay area in New York City now  Huge gay area  Used to be, what?  Greenwich Village, I guess  Greenwich Village  But now it's all  It's all about Chelsea  Chelsea  Well, there's this gym  What's the name of the gym?  It's called David Barton's  David Barton's  Ooh, and all the gay guys go there  And one guy got a membership  And he was a little upset  Because he went in there 
[01:47:30]  And was being ogled  Or ogled  Ogled  Ogled  Ogled  He was being looked at  When he was in the locker room  Said there was all kinds of oral sex  Between men going on in the bathroom stalls  And in the shower  And one time he was in the locker room by himself  And another guy came in  And sat uncomfortably close to him  And just stared at him naked  And the guy wanted his membership money back  Because he's not into that kind of thing  Yeah, he wanted his membership back  But he also  His membership money back  But he also wanted like $25,000 
[01:48:00]  $25,000  Large for pain and suffering  Pain and suffering  Emotional distress  That's just funny stuff  That you tell your friends over and over again  Of course it is  People put pain and suffering  And mental anguish  And all that  They put that tag on everything  Things that normally are just people  It gives you life stories  That's a life story  But if you put it in lawsuit  Then it's pain and suffering  And causes you all kinds of emotional distress  Exactly  Well, you know  This gym is supposed to be prestigious 
[01:48:30]  So this guy David Barton's reputation  Is at stake  As they say, Anthony  Well, this is pretty funny  Here's the update  At least one person  Leaving David Barton's trouble  Chelsea muscle mecca yesterday  Says it's a fantastic place to be  This is what happened  It was a big story in New York yesterday  So of course you're going to have some media down there  Checking it out for themselves  They're going to want to talk to some of the people that go there  And I'm sure some of these guys  Are attempting to maybe get inside the gym  They couldn't do that 
[01:49:00]  So some reporters are waiting outside  For people leaving the gym  So they can get some quotes from these guys  People, okay  Right  So one guy leaves  And he says it's a fantastic place to be  The trouble is  It was Barton himself  Yeah  The owner  He got caught  He saw the post reporter outside  And decided  Wow, I can help my own cause here  I'll make believe I'm a member of this gym  And I'll leave  And make believe  That everything is fine and dandy  There'll be plenty of good quotes from Joe 
[01:49:30]  Right  That's what he called himself  Yeah  He tried to fool the reporter  By saying that his name was Joe  I'm Joe  And this place is great  What an idiot  Barton identifying himself as Joe  Told the post reporter  Sounds frivolous  I have only fantastic things to say about this gym  Of course you do  You're the owner  When the reporter realized that  His barrel chested interview subject  Was the gym's jokester owner  Barton said he was just kidding  And apologized for misidentifying himself 
[01:50:00]  I'm just kidding  I was kidding  I was kidding  The guy's an idiot too  Because there was a picture of him in the paper yesterday  They had a picture  When the article was printed of him  Give her a quail  She'll love me again in the morning  You know that gym is so polluted  I can't have a kid with it  Bunch of faggots fucking in the steam room  Let's go to G in Brooklyn  Fawking  Socking  Eating  Drinking  Put a cock in your mouth  Pelicans  G in Brooklyn 
[01:50:30]  Hey guys  How are you doing?  Hey  I just want to tell you  I work with a shit dick downtown  And he calls the place  He calls it the jismnasium  Jismnasium?  Yeah  Jismnasium  Ah  You know  As a little goof today  I think we should play shit dick  We haven't played it for the new listeners yet  Shit dick  Can we find that out?  I'd love to hear that  Alright  Anyway  When a real gym member  When real gym members  Talked about the lawsuit Anthony 
[01:51:00]  In which he claimed  Men swapped sex acts in the showers  And leered at him in the locker room  Several said  The lathered up litigant  Should lighten up  Lathered up litigant  Stop  It's the New York Post  It shouldn't even be called a newspaper anymore  The New York Post  Yeah  Don't go to a known gay gym  If you're a heterosexual homophobe  Gym member Stephen Dimmick  Huffed  Huffed  I know they're insanely  Pulling the cock out of his mouth  He commented  I know they're insanely strict on it  They've revoked people's memberships 
[01:51:30]  For having sex in the gym  I've seen people get kicked out  This is Chelsea  If you're not comfortable  Don't come  It's not about being comfortable  It's not saying  I don't want  Men who swish  But if guys are drinking  Out of each other's mules  In the bathroom  How are you supposed to work out  When you're too busy  Peeking through  And jerking off  You're all excited  You know how hard it is  To work out with a boner  God almighty 
[01:52:00]  I mean it's hard enough  To do a show in here  When somebody lifts their arms up  And that little shirt lifts  To reveal the lower part  Of that abdomen  For Pete's sake  Just want to admire it  Run your hands over it  For a second  Put a little lotion on there  You know I can't even  Yawn anymore in here  Why?  Stretch your arms out  Only I hate when you buy  Extra large shirts  Mediums for you  Because of you  I'm all cramped up  Every morning now  I can't  Those arms go up  That little V comes out  Saying hello  Good morning  This is healthy living 
[01:52:30]  I used to be able to  Stretch out my whole back  Anthony  I can't do it anymore  So I have to do the show  All cramped  Gym member Orlando Hernandez  Added  I think it's silly  If you can't stand the heat  Get out of the kitchen  Jesus  This guy's creating  Like slogans  He said gym member  Eric Logan  If it's going to make  A difference to him  Then he should go  To a straighter gym  By the way  Orlando Hernandez  Is El Duque  Yeah 
[01:53:00]  That's El Duque  Oh okay  Didn't know he was gay  This guy's saying  That the guy doesn't like it  He should go to a straighter gym  But you're not expecting  To see any type of sex  When you're going to work out  That's the problem here  No  No  The obvious thing here is  This is a gym  In Chelsea  It's full of gay guys  If you go there  You're going to have to deal with it  If you don't want to deal with it  Go to another gym  This is gay guy heaven  Imagine a gym 
[01:53:30]  That was co-ed  Right  We go in there  The girls  Are horny  Like men horny  And they're just  Suck your cock  Suck your cock  Oh okay  You're going to go  No  There may be people here  That don't want that kind of thing  Going on in this gym  How fast would you be in the stall  Just getting the knob hobbed  That's what the gay guys are doing  You've had your membership for a year  And you don't have a hint of muscle tone  Nothing  You look like a veal  And your wife's wondering  Why your body hasn't improved 
[01:54:00]  Wasting away with consumption  Yeah it is like  Going to a regular gym  And having full access  Yeah  To the woman's locker  Girls in the shower  Naked  You walk in  Just start pounding her  Just going to wash my hands  In between sets  Hey you want me to  Maybe you know  Kneel down in front of you  Oh  Oh okay  And then some guy comes in  And wants to put a stop  To the whole thing  What are you going to say  You're right  But if that did happen 
[01:54:30]  Can you imagine  The reaction  To a gay  Hey if he doesn't like it  You know tell the fact  If you just go to a straighter gym  People would be outraged  Of course  Of course  Let the gay guys  Have their moments  You saunter into the woman's locker room  In your little leotard  Hey ladies  How's everyone else doing today  Got your leg warmers  And headbands on  Woo tough workout out there  Yeah  Get into the shower  I can't wait to wash off this sweat  Right  Let's get physical

[01:56:00]  Everybody's grooving.  Everybody.  There you go.  Let's see.  And then I guess one more quote here.  Every gym has its occasional misbehaving ding-dong,  and we certainly enforce a strict penal code.  Oh, that was a lot of laughs down at the post.  Seriously, though, we don't tolerate shenanigans  that would impact other members' experience of our gyms. 
[01:56:30]  Making a huge comeback.  Never used to see shenanigans.  Anytime there's any horseplay going on,  people are calling it shenanigans.  All right.  Yeah, what the hell, we'll play this for the new listeners.  Listen to this one.  We hate all shenanigans.

That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best on you? 
[02:01:00]  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best on you?  Has someone taken your faith? It's real, the pain you feel.  You trust, you must, you trust.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best on you? 
[02:01:30]  All right, one more call from D.C.  Nap, what's up?  Hey, man, what's going on, fellas?  Napster.  Hey, I want to tell you guys, first of all, you know, you guys are doing a real fucking great job, man.  I just caught the virus last week.  And I actually, I sell cars in Alexandria, and I sell XM, and my buddy turned me on the all-station.  You guys are fucking great, man.  But back on topic, I went to a gym, man.  I had this guy, you know, hitting on me. 
[02:02:00]  And, you know, I'm not really a homophobic, but I definitely ain't gay.  And I basically, you know, just, you know, let him know, you know, kind of give me my space.  But I went to go change, and I was in the locker room, and he comes in there, he's hitting on me again while I'm changing.  Well, he goes to walk away and fucking catch me on the ass.  So the motherfucker goes and gets in the shower.  So I grab my gym sock, and I put my keys in it, and I go in there in the shower, and I just beat the shit out of him.  He put my gym socks and the keys in it.  And I told the motherfucker next time he wants to get a piece of dick to buy a dildo. 
[02:02:30]  Then what happened?  Nothing. I fucking left, and I never heard nothing about it or saw the bastard again.  But did they revoke your gym membership?  Hell no. They ain't got a fucking clue who beat the shit out of him.  No, no, no, no, no. What I'm trying to say is, had you started with cardio?  Because I'm trying, I'm thinking about what kind of a workout thing I want to do.  Jimmy, the best workout you can do is jack off.  That's the guy who just doesn't get what the point of the story is.  Right.  No, did you do cardio first? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, boy.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, and then when this dummy goes into his shower with his socks, what'd you have to do?  Go home like a Dominican?  Just dry your feet off and put them in your shoes?  Why not just punch the guy?  Why would you put your keys in your socks and get them wet in his shower?  More of a movie moment that way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Why didn't you just put a little bomb in his radio?  So when he starts snapping his fingers and listening to it on his shoulder, it blows up,  Horowitz.  Wow.  That's a good one.  That's a great little reference.  That's right. 
[02:03:30]  That guy hit on you because you weren't there, Moreno.  So we have the audio of that girl.  Where is it, though?  Oh, cool.  Steve?  Steve's got it?  I thought he had it.  I thought he had it, too.  I thought he said he had it.  I got it.  Steve is full of shit.  Steve.  I thought you had it, Steve.  We're dying in here.  Big, smooth, shaved arms with tattoos on them.  Tattoos?  What?  Where's that audio, Steve?  It's right there.  I just gave it to you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[02:04:00]  I never saw it.  What is that?  What is it, Hawk, for Christ's sake?  Come on, Eric.  Eric needs to sleep more.  Open your eyes.  You really need to sleep more, Eric.  You certainly do.  I was right in front of you.  It was right under your nose.  God, this is a really long thing.  How long is it, Ope?  Yeah, she kind of goes on.  A couple hours.  What's the deal with this chick?  What do we know about this girl?  Well, we don't know much, but what I'm finding out very slowly is that apparently this chick  killed herself after this video was released.  I don't know.  It's such an urban legend.  I don't know. 
[02:04:30]  I'm trying to.  Dude.  Dude.  I swear.  She killed herself, dude.  I've heard all kinds of stories.  She had to change schools.  She killed herself.  No one's got an answer, though.  No.  Unfortunately, I can't find any proof.  She appears to be in high school, but who knows?  There's other things like her.  I've heard she's really young, but no.  Her body, believe me, is that of a woman. 
[02:05:00]  Yes.  And she's talking about this guy, Matt, and how she wants to get with Matt.  They didn't have bodies like that when we were going to high school.  God, if I hear one more person say that.  They were saying that on the news the other day.  We all get it.  The girls are hotter in high school than when we were growing up.  I didn't dress like that when I...  Exactly.  I watched.  How many times have you heard that?  You see a black guy walking.  Wow, we didn't have them in the hallways when I was in school.  All right.  You're awful 50 stories.  No one gives a shit.  You know, me and Groucho were talking. 
[02:05:30]  She brought up the same thing.  Well, it's funny.  Girls like that.  When Jane Mansfield got decapitated, people were going,  they didn't have heads like that when I was in school,  being held up under the fucking wreckage of a trailer.  Any Jane Mansfield's head reference, I enjoy.  Oh, you have to.  They were all over the road just like she was.  I was just riding, looking for something with Mansfield in it.  They didn't have heads like that. 
[02:06:00]  What did that mean?  Of course they did.  No one ever said that either.  So I just lied for a cheap decapitation joke.  It was a joy, though.  Of course.  So we'll just play this audio and see what happens, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  Give a listen.  It's some girl trying to get Matt to either take her back or go out with her.  I think take her back.  So she shows her sexual side.  And what you'll hear is audio of her talking to Matt as she takes her clothes off  and then diddles herself.  Now, if a girl does this for you, what are you thinking?  Obviously that you're going to have some really good sex in the near future. 
[02:06:30]  But as far as a long-term plan, what's going on in your head?  Are you thinking psycho broad?  But if you're in high school, nah.  If you're in high school, you run.  You run.  Dick first.  You run.  As fast as you can.  Right towards this.  Oh, we got more info on the girl, Anthony.  Oh, I'm sure.  From the video.  Yeah, of course it is.  Mike in Jersey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys were wondering what happened with that girl in the video.  Uh-huh.  I heard she ate Pop Rock and drank Pepsi. 
[02:07:00]  She fucking flew up.  Wow.  If you agree with me, just hang up.  Very good.  He hung up on himself.  He did.  All right, here's the audio.  Matt, um, you don't understand how much I like you.  I know you think I like you a lot, but that's only the half of it.  And I know you really don't want a girlfriend right now, but you have to think of what you're 
[02:07:30]  putting me through, too.  If I can put up with you and all your shit for this long, I'm obviously going to stay  with you forever.  So, um, I really just want to let you know what you're missing out on.  So, uh, here's a little bit of my, uh, sexual side.  Wow, is she naked?  Uh, no.  Right now she's dressed.  She's got, like, kind of a little top thing on that's showing her belly. 
[02:08:00]  And she's wearing a jacket, some kind of jacket over it, and, uh, pants.  She sounds young, man.  So then she is in front of the camera and starts doing things.  Big boobies?  Um, nice size.  Braces?  No.  No pigtails?  No.  No pigtail.  Blonde hair.  Okay.  There's the cleavage I don't have.  There's the, uh, boobs I kind of have. 
[02:08:30]  And a bra.  Here's my, like, um, stomach.  Makes her shirt off.  She's in her bra and pants.  Again.  Now I'm, like, no.  She takes her bra off.  And, uh,  It's hard to hear what's going on. 
[02:09:00]  She's kind of away from the camera.  Okay.  She kind of walked back, so she's completely in frame.  And, uh, she, uh, takes her, uh, shirt off.  And she's in her bra.  And she's dancing around.  And then she danced around a little more and takes her bra off.  Goes back to the camera.  Takes her pants off.  Takes her panties off.  And then takes her fingers and starts doing things.  Ooh.  To herself.  Saucy.  You're going to, uh, give all of the, just because you don't hold it over? 
[02:09:30]  Well, I think it's me, uh, I hope it's stupid to get back.  Don't you?  But, uh, it's all up to you.  It's all up to you, Matt.  This could be yours.  And I thought, this is all up to you. 
[02:10:00]  And no matter what you decide, Matt, I will always understand.  Because I'm that kind of person who can just go with the flow.  And I never will underestimate you or your decision for whatever you pick. 
[02:10:30]  All right, is she back in?  Now what's going on here?  Now she's back.  She tilts the camera down to her lap area.  And she's, uh, taking fingers and doing things to herself.  So she's back in range so we can hear her.  Yeah, yeah.  And now she starts doing herself and telling Matt, you know, that this could all be his. 
[02:11:00]  So what we just heard was her kind of in the background.  Dancing.  Yeah, it's like full frame.  Everyone is screaming, where is the video, where is the video, where is the video?  I have no idea.  I've never seen it, actually.  Good luck finding it.  And good luck with the federal authorities if you do find it.  She sounds like a young man.  She sounds young.  Here's something that I know you want to see. 
[02:11:30]  Camera's on her lap.  You've been waiting for that for a long time, haven't you, Matt?  You can have it all.  The whole package.  All you have to do.  It's off.  It's getting a little worked up.  And I will understand whatever you pick. 
[02:12:00]  Because I love you, Matt.  And you'd be a fool to get this up.  Because no matter how hard you try, you know.  You can't just give up on me.  Because deep down inside, in your little twisted head, 
[02:12:30]  you love me.  You're just afraid to admit it.  Because you don't know what's going to happen to you.  If you tell the world how you feel about me.  Just do it, Matt.  She needs the Gregster phone number.  I was just going to say that.  Because I know you want to.  You want to so bad. 
[02:13:00]  Can you hear it?  I know what.  I don't know, but I think it's pretty hot.  That's pretty much what she's doing.  And then she, you know, puts the video back up and dance around.  And then at some point she goes to a door jam.  And straddles, like, puts her leg up on the door jam.  And starts licking the door jam.  And saying that that could be Matt. 
[02:13:30]  She wants Matt.  She's kind of hung up.  She likes this Mattie the Moocher, doesn't she?  Yeah.  She's kind of hung up on it.  Let me try a little more of the audio.  The video's out.  It's on the internet somewhere, you know.  It's just a matter of finding it.  A lot of people are saying if you Google and type in Psycho Girl Matt.  Really?  There'll be a bunch of links.  Really?  That's what I'm hearing.  That's what I'm hearing, Anthony.  All of this. 
[02:14:00]  It really...  It really does play.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Is she naked at this point?  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  Now, I'll be showing her.  She's getting on the door jam.  I'm pressing against Matt.  Now, what is she doing?  Working the door jam?  Yeah.  Making believe she's pressing against Matt.  Or it could be you.  It's an ugly fat chick that would do anything for you. 
[02:15:00]  But me, on the other hand...  I'll do anything you ask.  All you have to do is to be nice.  And you've got it.  So, Matt...  I just wanted to let you know what you were missing out on.  And if you decide you want to change your mind about anything, just let me know. 
[02:15:30]  Because I'll be here.  And I totally, utterly understand anything.  Tell me.  Tell me.  And no matter how much you put me through...  I still love you.  No matter how hard...  I try...  To forget about you... 
[02:16:00]  You're still on my mind.  Forever...  And always.  So, uh...  Just...  I don't want to lose you. 
[02:16:30]  Bye, Matt.  I love you.  And there you have it.  Yeah.  And there's the video.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I, um...  Oh, my God.  It's funny.  I was talking to Eric Logan about this.  Yeah.  And Eric said, uh...  You know what?  She's making a play for Matt.  Ah, yeah.  I think she is.  Wow.  The video is ridiculous.  That's all I have to say.  I saw a picture of her face. 
[02:17:00]  And I haven't seen the video.  But the picture of her face...  She looks 18.  I mean, somebody...  She doesn't look young.  She sounds young, but she looks like she's...  The whole thing's probably a fake.  She looks, uh...  Like she could be 18.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I absolutely would choose...  Yeah.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Matt's a dope.  Matt's an idiot.  I hope Matt right now is hanging himself.  I love this Matt guy, because you know it was him that put it on the internet.  That's true.  It's gotta be, right?  Yeah.  All right, Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  Check instant feedback, because there's other links on here that say, um...  Oh, Psycho Girl.  All right, that's the same thing.  I thought it was, uh, uh, audio of another...  Dude, it's easy.  You can get it.  What you do is you go to eatabullet.com, and you go into Whoring Myself merchandise, and  there's, like, a bunch of, like, things for sale like that.  Hmm.  All right.  We can't find the, um, Psycho Ex-Girlfriend stuff, huh?  Nah, that's good stuff, though.  That stuff is gone.  Unless someone has it out there, and they can send it to us. 
[02:18:00]  A little homework assignment for some of the faithful listeners.  That was a great, great website, a girl that's just losing her mind over and over again for  this guy on his answer machine, and the guy being just a scumbag.  Oh, yeah.  And she's completely insane.  Made a website.  She just loses it.  There's, like, what, 20 or 30?  No, I think there's, like, it just goes on and on and on and on, right?  She doesn't stop calling.  All right.  Nut.  How many messages?  Just, I forget.  I mean, there was just...  That'd be 50.  There could easily be 50. 
[02:18:30]  One nuttier than a lot.  Just losing her mind, threatening him, and all sorts of crazy stuff.  You've got to love that guy, though.  What a great site.  Yeah.  All right.  I think we'll take a break and regroup, Anthony.  We got the Jimmy Stewart tech support call.  Remember, we were looking for this a few weeks back.  We're going to get through this.  It's a funny one.  This is funny.  We're going to get through to keep your chin off.  It just kind of ends, unfortunately.  There's no real big ending to it, but in general, it's very funny.  A lady had a problem with her computer, called the wrong number.  This is one of the guys from the Upright Citizens Brigade. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, is that who it is?  Really?  Ring off mic.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, there you are.  It is?  Yeah, because we had one of the guys in, and he brought this in to us.  Oh.  And gave it to us, because he didn't have a radio show.  He goes, guys, I used to get the wrong numbers all the time.  And I started taping them, and this is the one he did.  Oh, I forgot that that's where that came from.  He, uh, ah, yes.  He imitated Jimmy Stewart.  This lady thought she was getting some tech help, and this is how it went down.  Thanks, McCoy.  Hi.  Hi.  I'm trying to, um, get on the Barnes & Noble line, and I can't... 
[02:19:30]  Oh, what's your problem?  The problem is that every time I try to dial it, it comes up that they can't get through  and to call tech support.  Well, you gotta be more specific, but we're gonna get through this.  We're gonna turn this thing around.  Great.  Do you use your toolbar?  Yeah.  I guess.  What's the toolbar?  Well, you gotta use your toolbar.  That's where your icons are that we're gonna have to use to fix this form, but we're gonna 
[02:20:00]  get through this later.  You just gotta keep your chin up.  Okay.  I hope so.  Do you have a Mac or a PC?  I have a PC.  I have a Dell.  Oh, that's good.  That's fine instrument.  I also have, I have the disc.  You know, I have the, the, uh, Barnes & Noble disc.  Oh, you got the disc?  Yeah, and it's...  Oh, the disc?  Well, that's great.  That's great.  It's not working.  The sun's on the horizon.  We're gonna turn this thing around. 
[02:20:30]  Great.  Okay.  Put your disc in.  It's in?  Okay.  I'll boot up your computer.  You have to restart your computer.  Um, okay.  I gotta go to shut down.  That's where your toolbar is.  You gotta grab all of it.  Okay.  Shut down.  Restart.  Well, I'll grab all of your toolbar.  Okay.  I have that.  Now, do you want me to go to restart?  Okay.  You gotta stay focused now.  Don't get all upset.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Now, you gotta turn it off, but then you're gonna say to restart.  Now, you check restart. 
[02:21:00]  Now, there the...  Okay.  You want me to press...  Okay.  I understand what you're saying.  You want me to say press shut down or restart?  Restart.  Okay.  Okay.  You gotta stay focused or you lose your cool.  Okay.  You're making me confused, though.  So, I'm...  No.  Well, take a breath.  I'm taking a breath.  I'm...  All right.  Just calm down.  Take a breath.  So, I just...  I press restart.  Yeah.  Well, calm down now.  You can't yell at me here. 
[02:21:30]  I'm not...  No, I'm not yelling at you.  Okay.  I'm not yelling at you.  It's just...  You know, it's frustrating.  www.dell.com came up on my screen.  So, it'll be a minute or two now.  Okay.  Making all noises and what have you.  But I left the CD in there.  Is that good or should I take it out?  It'll say ROM, right?  Yep.  I'll stick a music CD in there.  No.  No.  I'm not joking.  No, I...  It'll break your computer. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, no.  It's like throwing vinegar on a horse's ass.  Really?  Well, that's a new expression on me.  I hadn't heard that one.  Excuse me?  I haven't heard that, throwing vinegar on a horse's ass before.  Well, try it.  You're going to get kicked in your head.  I guess so.  I don't spend much time around horses, so it wouldn't be something I know.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't spend time around horses, you end up making a jackass out of your own self.  Oh, well, that could be.  Where are you located now? 
[02:22:30]  Houston.  Oh, Houston?  Okay, well.  Well, what?  Well, that's...  Where are you from?  New York City.  That's right.  The 212.  Right.  So, you know, we don't have a lot of horses around.  Yeah, but you got a lot of jackasses up there.  Well, that's for sure.  That's for sure.  We're looking at 10 inches of snow on Saturday.  Well, I say, you don't look at the 10 inches.  You step out in there, you get out there, and you work.  You shove off that snow and turn things around. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, you're right.  Okay, now, it came up here.  Yahoo Messenger cannot connect.  Yahoo!  Hee-haw!  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. life.  Fuck you to the old lady driving five miles per hour in front of me in the fucking 45 mile per hour zone.  I hope you fall down a flight of steps and break both of your goddamn hips.  Fuck you.  Do you want to give a big F.U. to Graz?  She takes it in the butt. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Hey!  Notorious!  Wrangler!  Whoremaster D!  Bobby Martini!  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big F.U. out to Walmart because they block all the exile channels.  Yeah.  Fuck you, Walmart.  Yeah.  This is Steve from Long Island, New York.  This message is for all you fucks at Petland Discounts.  You bastards who fired me two years ago.  Fuck all of you.  Go take a ferret and shove it up your ass. 
[02:24:00]  Especially you, Bruce.  Hey, this is Andrew from Texas.  I'm going to give a big F.U. to Howard Stern.  Look at my balls.  Yeah.  Call the opiate Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.  I am alone, ever-ending that I believe is fading.  I am alone inside. 
[02:24:30]  I am alone.  Where's little Jimmy?  You had to go wee wee?  Because you might have had to go scrap.  You never know.  C-O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Hi Jimmy.  Hi Opie.  You had to go pee pee.  The breaks are so short here.  You never know.  C-O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Hi, Jimmy. 
[02:25:00]  Hi, Opie.  You have to go pee-pee.  The brakes are so short here.  I thought you might have to go scrap.  No.  No, you're all right?  No, I'm fine.  That's just...  Hey, do you mind if I do another shameless plug for our T-shirts?  Ah.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Let her rip.  Well, Jimmy just did.  That was fast.  What is it?  Where'd you get this?  Look at Ben Alcott, Dan.  I got it.  What is it?  The best.  The Robert Plant CD.  Wow. 
[02:25:30]  That one I asked for about 20 minutes ago.  Ooh.  Awesome.  I'm going to check that out tonight.  Yes.  We have these brand-new T-shirts, Anthony.  They really are cool as hell.  The design is awesome.  We got a new Opie and Anthony logo.  And on the back, it says Spread the Virus.  Very, very cool.  And they're selling like hotcakes.  Oh, not like the proverbial hotcakes.  They're selling like hotcakes.  And there's a thing going on where you can pre-order.  What does that mean to you?  Well, if you're a bigger dude or a bigger chick, or maybe you're a little girl, tiny little girl, 
[02:26:00]  and you know your size isn't going to be available, well, if you pre-order, you can get that.  Really?  Pre-ordering is ending any day now, though.  Any day.  And then after that, we're just going to get some, I don't know, some XLs and some large...  Regular sizes.  Regular sizes.  And if you can fit into them, great.  Wait, if you can't, you lose.  You lose.  So you go to opianthony.com.  There's a little link where you could pre-order your Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirts. 
[02:26:30]  My brother has taken this project on, and now he's regretting it.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  He's getting a lot of email.  A lot of work.  I guess his email address, or the one he's checking, or I don't know.  I don't know what's going on over there.  There's some kind of weird thing going on.  What's the address, Opie?  Dr. Duck, D-U-K, at AOL.com.  Dr. Duck?  Yeah, I know.  D-U-K?  D-U-K.  I guess D-U-C-K was taken.  Yeah.  So it's doctor, spell out doctor, D-U-K, at the end, drduck, at AOL.com, to pre-order 
[02:27:00]  your Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirts.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Very good.  Hey, you want to clean up some old business here, Anthony?  Sure.  We got a 60 Minutes thing that we never got to.  60 Minutes?  It's a slow news day, so we're kind of, I don't know, we don't want to waste time talking  about dumb stuff, so.  We have a lot of these things that we never got to when we were really, really busy on  the show.  Mm-hmm.  So 60 Minutes did a thing on parents allowing their teens to drink. 
[02:27:30]  Ooh.  I say that's a good idea, by the way.  You do?  Yeah.  You know where they are when they're stumbling around.  Yeah.  Some parents aren't too good at it, though.  They let them drink a little too much, and there's problems at the house.  The cops are called, and the parents get arrested for letting their kids drink.  Remember the keg parties when we were growing up?  Oh, yeah.  Mom and Dad went away to the Poconos for a quick little love retreat, and all hell broke  loose.  They'd roll the wooden kegs into my house off the horse-drawn carts. 
[02:28:00]  Yes, I've been to quite a few of those keggers.  In between dumping tea into a harbor?  Right.  They would roll some kegs over your house.  Sure.  Sure.  My house was always the party house.  Yeah, mine was, too.  My mom knew what was going on, but she wasn't there.  She worked at a disco out there on Long Island.  She was a waitress out there at a disco.  So, she would work Friday and Saturday nights until, you know, she wouldn't be home until 
[02:28:30]  five in the morning.  So, she would leave at about ten or so.  What's wrong?  You're scraping.  What's wrong with you?  Would you bring a spoon from home?  I always do.  Why?  What's wrong with a plastic spoon?  You never know if there's going to be a spoon or a...  They scrape louder plastic.  You know how hard it is to eat yogurt with a fork, you silly goose?  That's true.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, mom would leave at about ten.  You know, that's not funny.  Oh, that is funny.  No, it's not.  They got a sound effect of me eating yogurt that Eric just throws in every once in a while.  I like it.  I need that.  They hate me already.  Get you in trouble with that all the time.  I know.  You need that button.  You could kill me.  All right, go ahead, Anthony.  Yeah, she would leave for work at about ten o'clock or so, and all my friends were down  the road, you know, a couple of side streets in their cars, and they would see my mother's  car pull away, and they would all just pull up, converge on the house.  Each of them would bring maybe a couple of six-packs of beer, a little bottle of Jack 
[02:29:30]  or something like that, a bag of weed.  A little weed.  Some weed.  And come upstairs to the house, and that was it.  We were playing cards, watching dirty movies on the HBO, and drinking.  At the house.  My mother knew what was going on.  She'd come home at five in the morning, and half of them are still passed down on the  floor, sleeping on the couch.  I thought you were going to say.  Beer bottles everywhere.  I thought you were going to say you were watching porn on the eight-millimeter reels.  No, no.  HBO.  You weren't watching on HBO when you were a kid. 
[02:30:00]  No?  No.  WHT, maybe.  A little Wameco home theater.  Wameco home theater.  No.  The first one I had was Cinema 100.  I don't remember that one.  Cinema 100.  That was local cable on Long Island.  It was a box, sat on top of your television, and what it gave you was, you got all the  regular channels really clear, because it was cable, and then you would hit this, you  would turn a key on top of the box.  It was a key, and you'd turn it and flip this big switch over, and then you were on, you 
[02:30:30]  put it to channel three, and you would get Cinema 100, and every week you would get a little  movie guide of what was going to be on, and it was, you know, movies that had been in  the theater maybe a year earlier, and some softcore pornography.  On one channel?  Yeah.  And most people had the illegal box.  It was just a quick wire job.  Yeah.  And you got it without the key.  Remember the remote?  I mean, it was like a foot and a half long.  And it was connected with a wire.  Connected to the box.  So you had a wire going from the top of your television, where the box was, to the remote 
[02:31:00]  unit, which was this long box with, like, a bunch of buttons on it.  And it was like, a-conk, a-conk, a-conk.  It had about 15 buttons wide, and then there was another switch.  So you'd use the 15 buttons, then you'd switch the switch down one, and you'd use the 15 buttons  for, like, 15 through 30, and then you'd flip it again, and it would be 30 through 45, and  you had, like, 45 channels.  And that was it.  With a wire that everyone would trip over. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, it wasn't just one channel.  That's what I'm saying.  It was 45 different channels?  Yeah, you'd get cable channels, but then for Cinema 100, you had to turn the key and flip  the switch.  Okay.  Yeah, ready for some porno.  Going to watch Cheerleaders for the 8,000th time.  Watch those big 70s Earth Mama muffs.  Watch a bunch of 35 or 40-year-old women acting like they're supposed to be cheerleaders in  high school.  What movie was that?  It's called Cheerleaders.  Oh, it was called Cheerleaders?  There were some hot girls in there, but for the most part, it was just awful. 
[02:32:00]  They were girls with just these rank, huge muffs.  And all softcore pornography.  You have that?  Yeah.  You have Cheerleaders?  Yeah.  That's what set off Debbie Does Dallas.  Really?  Yeah.  Eric has everything.  Eric has fairy tales.  Eric could open up a museum.  He collects everything.  It has anything to do with radio, TV, porn.  There was a porno version of a bunch of fairy tales, and it was called Fairy Tales.  I remember that one.  Yeah.  And it was, you know, there was a... 
[02:32:30]  Jack and Jill went up the hill, but...  Snow White and the seven dwarfs.  Yeah.  And then they would bang.  They were banging.  And then there was dwarfs, seven dwarfs.  I remember that.  And Snow White, and there were midgets, midget guys having sex with his chick.  I remember that one.  That was a huge turn-on when I was growing up.  Huge.  Oh, watch that and just scratch it.  Jack and Jill couldn't be bothered with that stupid water.  They were banging on the side of the hill.  Banging.  Yeah.  Doing some of that banging.  Good stuff.  All right.  So 60 Minutes did a thing on parents allowing teen drinking, Anthony. 
[02:33:00]  What do you think about your son drinking?  You think that it's okay?  If I could say to him, no, you cannot drink, and no, he wouldn't, that would be a wonderful  situation, and it would be the answer to everything.  But that's just not realistic.  These kids do drink.  Just saying no just doesn't work.  What if you had said, okay, I'll have the party, but no alcohol?  They wouldn't have come.  Of course they wouldn't have come.  Because they're realistic.  I'd have them just go into the woods, too. 
[02:33:30]  A place called The Corral.  It's a place in the woods.  You'd clear out a clearing, take some logs, make a fence out of it, clear it out, big  fire, and Friday or Saturday night, you'd go to The Corral, get in the woods, you know,  everyone would bring their own booze, and you'd just sit there and drink and try to pick  up on the girls.  These parents are taking on a lot, though.  I mean, they're allowing their kids to drink in their house.  Jesus Christ.  What happened?  Now you're just wrong. 
[02:34:00]  What is this, cheerleaders?  Oh, okay.  Look, yeah.  That was the hot chick in cheerleaders, but look at this muff.  Oh, my God.  No one was eating pussy back then.  Eric will find anything.  It's a girl showering.  Ew.  Yeah.  There's nothing hot about her showering right now.  And she was the hot one from cheerleaders.  I guess she's all nervous.  Is she the girl that is insecure about her body, so she's trying to get a quick showering?  Get a quick one done before someone walks in.  Oh, what?  But she's getting caught, Anthony.  She thought she could shower. 
[02:34:30]  Here comes the football players.  Is there a hardcore sex on this, or no?  No, that's soft core.  Why would she be taking a shower in the men's locker room, Anthony?  I don't know, but now these 70s dudes, they all got the 70s dude haircuts.  You have the big, long sideburns.  There's a black guy chasing her around, too.  And now she's getting chased around the shower, Anthony.  Chasing around the...  Oh, boy.  She just got grabbed.  She just got grabbed.  She's getting raped in the shower is what's happening here.  These guys are all just horned up, and they find this girl in their locker room, and they're  going to teach her a lesson, Anthony.  Wow, they certainly are, huh? 
[02:35:00]  That's the end of the clip?  Yeah, there's not much online.  Sorry.  That's all you get.  Oh, rest assured, she gets banged, Opie.  Yeah?  I hate to ruin the ending for you, but yeah.  All right.  Yeah, but these parents, it's a little risky, you know, to allow them drinking at your house,  and then eventually they're going to have to go home.  They're going to have to leave, and if they're hammered, your responsibility.  These people who say, well, we take their keys, and we make sure that they don't leave.  That, to me, is just a fallacy, because is my child going to get violent? 
[02:35:30]  Is my child going to overindulge?  Did I give you permission to take those risks with my child?  Hmm, so now here's the other parents going, right, hey, going, wait a minute, what are  you doing allowing this at your house?  But, like they're saying, they could just leave, go somewhere else, and drink, and your  kid is going to be the same way.  You know, maybe he's getting violent, maybe he's overindulging, and now he's not even  in the safety of someone's house.  I am not even listening to you, Anthony, because there was a clip from Fairy Tales. 
[02:36:00]  Fairy Tales.  I've got to tell you something, man, the old pornos are so much hotter to watch.  They're just so much hotter, because it almost looks like it could be reality.  Yeah, with the bad 70s hair and wood paneling moves they're in.  Look at all the wood paneling.  I remember this scene, I think this is a young little thing, was bored, and she was sleeping  over her friend's house, and the father was down in the living room watching some TV,  and he was bored, and next thing you know, they're banging. 
[02:36:30]  The cheerleaders went over, because the high school's having a big football game the next  day, so the cheerleaders got together with the football team, and they're banging.  And yeah, one of them decided to do the father of one of the cheerleaders.  Yeah, Mr. Skin comes through once again today for the program.  Oh, he's not done yet.  He has to be done.  You can see it from the side.  Look at this girl trying to wake up the black guy, but he's had too much already.  Look at him.  Oh my God, look at her muff.  Oh my God.  It looked like she's wearing a bikini bottom. 
[02:37:00]  Definitely looked like a bikini bottom.  Holy Jesus.  I must say, these girls are a bit horny, Anthony.  They can't get the guys awake anymore.  Oh, they can't.  Because they satisfy themselves.  Because they wore them out.  Wore all the football players out.  Wow, look at that triangle.  Oh my God.  When was that ever sexy?  I think it was the opposing team.  They went over to the opposing team's house and had sex with them so that next day, they'd  be all tired on the field.  And they'd lose the game?  And they'd lose the game.  The joke would be on the guys that won, though, because these guys are getting laid. 
[02:37:30]  Who cares about winning a stupid football game?  These guys have sex with all your cheerleaders.  Don't you join a team in high school so you can get laid?  Or stick pine cones up young boys' asses.  That was a hot story.  Whatever you're going to your football team for, those football camp stories, we're a bunch  of gay guys on these football teams.  They go, we have to initiate you.  Let me get a pine cone and shove it up your ass.  It's not the first thing that comes to mind as far as a bunch of guys together for an initiation.  Pine cone. 
[02:38:00]  All right, let's play another clip here, Anthony.  Binge drinking is the problem.  Ah.  It's not just drunk driving.  That's one of the myths, that if we just protect our kids from drunk driving, that they'll be safe.  But sexual assault, violence, we are not doing our children a favor by providing them a, quote,  safe place to drink.  Well, I don't know.  That person just sounds out of touch.  You should, obviously, the best thing would be them not drinking.  As far as the parent's concerned, you want your kid not drinking. 
[02:38:30]  But they will, you know, for the most part, not all of them.  They will.  So, you want it in your house, or you want it outside?  Drunk driving back in the old days.  There was a sport.  Oh, sport.  The cops would pull you over and tell you to go home.  Not no more.  Now you could go into jail.  Anthony, here's Leslie Stahl asking, what's a keg stand?  Did she do one?  See, that would have been funny. 
[02:39:00]  They said I had to do one.  Oh, well, here I go.  I want to get in touch with what's going on in this story, so I'm going to try one of  these keg stands.  What's a keg stand?  Listen how confused she sounds.  She's stupid.  What's a keg stand?  I don't know what that is.  You don't know what a keg stand is?  I swear to God.  Yeah.  You really don't know what a keg stand is.  But you wouldn't say it like that, if you were asking.  What's a keg?  Like, she almost doesn't know the words.  But, Jimmy, you could probably figure it out if you had to. 
[02:39:30]  A keg stand is probably something you put the keg on.  No, that would be.  No, no, Jimmy.  No.  You go to the beer distributor, he gives you the keg and the keg stand, and you've got  to put a deposit on it.  I honestly don't know.  A keg stand?  You don't know what?  You're about to find out.  Okay, it's doing a keg stand.  Now, can you get it?  You would be doing a keg stand.  No.  No.  Not right.  Not right.  What's a keg stand?  Somebody grabs the two handles on the keg.  Two other people grab your feet and lift you up, so you're vertically straight up in the 
[02:40:00]  air.  And you just take the hat and just put it in your mouth.  And you were doing that?  Yeah.  All three of you did that?  We got real loud during that.  That was when it got loud.  That's why the cops came.  What you do is you count, like, really how long you go for, and, you know, it's all about  competition to see who goes for longest.  That's a little pushy way to do the keg stand, by the way.  What you got to do is take the tap out, and then have somebody press down.  You got to press down on the ball when you're in the keg stand position, so it just comes  flying up into you like a fire hose. 
[02:40:30]  That's what you do.  Me and my friends would get crazy when we drank, man.  I remember one time I had two Pabst Blue Ribbons in, like, one of those hats with the beer  on the side, and I drank out of both straws.  You're a madman.  The place went crazy.  Then you grabbed a knife and started running down the street.  Held it in my friend's throat.  Lightweight.  How much would put you over the top?  I don't know.  I drank, I preferred hard liquor.  Hard liquor?  Yeah, Everclear, that type of stuff.  It was cheap.  Everclear?  It was cheap.  It wasn't even liquor anymore.  That's just fuel.  It wasn't about it being tasty. 
[02:41:00]  It was just about it being effective.  Getting effed up.  Yeah.  You didn't like stretching out, though, a few beers over the whole course of the night.  Yeah, if you had money, but we had eight bucks between two guys, you had to split a  case of Meisterbrow.  The bastard that would bring over the six-pack of Meisterbrow, put it in the fridge and grab  the Heineken, or the Bud.  Son of a bitch.  Going to the end of the night, and there's that six-pack of Meisterbrow.  It was the only thing left.  Someone brought it.  Cheapo.  I liked it, actually.  You get warm Meisterbrow in a field.  Ugh. 
[02:41:30]  The master brew.  Anthony, one more clip here.  I guess Kansas, I guess it's a law.  You're not allowed to have your kids drinking in your house.  In your house?  Yeah, so you can't be one of these cool parents.  Right.  Where you're like, hey, everyone come over here and drink.  Cool parents' house.  Meanwhile in Kansas, the cops are holding parents responsible.  They're patrolling the streets in search of a party.  If the parents allowed it, they'll be arrested, and DA Paul Morrison will try to send them  for a weekend in the county jail. 
[02:42:00]  I think the argument that I have a safe alcohol party for my kids is like saying, you can come  over to my house and have sex.  I'm going to have a bunch of condoms down in the basement, so we'll make sure that it's  safe sex.  But come on over, because I know you're going to do it anyway.  You can do it on the futon in my basement.  All right.  Would that be acceptable?  Of course.  That sounds good.  Of course.  I like the way this guy thinks.  You're supplying the condoms and everything.  Yeah.  Safe sex.  No one's getting pregnant.  It's an awful example, too, because you don't have unprotected sex and kill a family on 
[02:42:30]  the way home, you fucking idiot prosecutor.  That is not a good analogy.  It's terrible.  Stop it.  I don't care if you victimize yourselves, but when you're drinking and you get behind the  wheel, you're threatening everybody.  Yeah.  I don't care who you bang and what you wear on your mule.  That's your problem.  I don't care if you get drunk and throw yourself in front of a train.  Good for you, lady, nice husband, or whoever it might be.  Would you rather have your daughter getting banged in the dugout in some field somewhere  or down in the den? 
[02:43:00]  Down at the point.  At least you can do a melanin check on the way in.  With Ron Johnson, stereo salesman, down there at the point.  At the point, it is.  All right.  Let's go to Jesse in Illinois.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, I was just about the fairytale porn.  I don't know if you guys ever saw the Cinderella one.  It was the first porn I ever saw. 
[02:43:30]  It was an HBO one.  And the plot of it, I guess, was that Cinderella, she was getting ready.  The fairy godmother ended up being a black guy that was just robbing the house at the  time.  And he found this wand that wasn't actually a wand.  Anyways, put it to her pussy, gave her a snapping pussy.  So she went to the ball and the guy, the prince, was fucking all these girls blindfolded.  And when he got to her, her pussy started making this noise, snapping pussy.  You know, then she runs out.  Just like the Cinderella story. 
[02:44:00]  So then he has to try to fuck all these girls again.  Just a bunch of funny shit went on.  Like the fairy godmother, or the fairy, or the, I'm sorry, the evil sex sisters.  Wow.  Okay, wasn't that funny?  Oh, wow.  Brother Joe wants in.  Joe.  Hey, fellas.  Hola.  Do you remember, at the crowd, like, I mean, first of all, it was almost like a cult. 
[02:44:30]  It was something that couldn't be done, really, at any parent's house.  We were, like, have to drink down a pint of Jack Daniels straight through without stopping,  like, I'm talking with Chauncey and Joe, you know, Joe Curry.  That was the older, that was you guys and, like, Bill Brady or something.  Oh, okay, yeah, that wasn't so much.  Yeah, because there were different things.  If you went, like, if I went to the corral and my brother was there with his friends.  There was an initiation?  No, we had to leave.  Oh, really? 
[02:45:00]  Like, that was, like, there were older people.  And there was polarization, I guess.  Yeah, and then sometimes there were people that were even older.  Like, guys that were out of high school that were hanging out at the corral.  And you walked up and saw those, you got the hell out of there.  You ran, because, you know, they were, you know, drunks.  Instead of you just going there to party.  There was a time where you used to have to, like, drink down a pint of Jack Daniels  without stopping, like, in one straight shot.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, they do that now and die.  Yeah, yeah.  And the game, whoa, you played that too, didn't you? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, this was a game.  We used to come up with drinking games.  We'd sit around in a circle with a milk crate in the middle.  And a bottle on top of the milk crate.  No, no.  And you'd kick it.  And you'd spin.  What?  And I guess the idea was for somebody to try to kick the crate and have their foot get  stuck in it.  And then once their foot got stuck, everyone would start kicking the crate as hard as they  can going, whoa, whoa, whoa, trying to break the guy's ankle or something.  And then there was a big fire in the middle. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, and then you would, you know, drink.  The games didn't have to make sense now.  Yeah, I don't know.  Didn't have to make any sense.  It was all about the drinking.  It was called whoa.  Whoa.  Anthony used to play whoa.  You'd have to get the milk crate.  And then, yeah.  And if you're the guy with the foot stuck in the milk crate, are you just yelling, whoa,  whoa, let's stop.  Yeah, you'd be like, stop, whoa.  And everyone's going, whoa, whoa.  And then another idea was to get the crate up in the air, like a soccer ball, because 
[02:46:30]  once it got up there, someone could kick it right at your face.  And again, you would go, whoa, and drink.  You guys were classy, playing with a crate.  Jesus, did any of you have any money for a soccer ball?  No.  We're talking about an island, man.  That game should have been called homo.  No.  Not whoa.  Whoa.  We're getting someone drunk enough, so drunk they fell asleep.  And, well, we wouldn't play with pine cones, but you set them on fire.  Yeah, there was always a setting on fire.  Joe Curry, a friend of mine, would always fall asleep at any party we were at, anywhere. 
[02:47:00]  It didn't matter.  And if it was at someone's house, we'd tie his shoelaces together, shuttle the lights  out, go to someone else's house to continue the party, and then call the house he was  at.  And you just, as the phone's ringing and ringing, you just know what's going on, because  he picks up the phone and goes, yeah, watch.  He's all mad, because you know he just fell down, hurt himself.  I remember one night he fell asleep in Chauncey's barn, and we took, we were drinking in Chauncey's  barn, and he took, and we took that spraying ether, and he just kept on, like, spraying 
[02:47:30]  his leg real light, with spraying ether, lighting him up, and you wake him up, hey, Joe,  Joe, look, you're on fire.  Joe, Joe, wake up, you're on fire, Joe.  And he'd be like, what?  Jesus Christ!  He's on patting himself out.  You fall asleep again, you do it again.  Set one guy on fire so bad, this is what Billy Brady was up, that kid, Pasquale, who set  him on fire so bad that it didn't go out.  He actually went running down the street, and every time his leg, like, moved through 
[02:48:00]  running, you'd hear, like, whoop, whoop.  He hit, like, the flames in the wind, like a torch.  He actually, he actually set himself on fire, that's what he did, he soaked it down so  much in spraying ether that his leg went up and it wouldn't go out, because he would,  like, set it on fire, run out into the street, and stop traffic, and, you know, laugh, we'd  laugh, you know.  One time, he soaked it a little too much, and it set on fire, really bad, I mean, like,  third degree burns.  This is the drunken fun we used to have on Long Island. 
[02:48:30]  Amazing.  Very good, Joe.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  So good.  I remember one time, I was at a party, and we all got drunk, and we had some firecrackers,  and my friend lit a firecracker, and went out in the yard, he threw it up in the air,  it went off.  It went off?  Yeah.  And it went back inside?  Yeah, yeah, it was late.  Yeah, of course.  It was late.  It was late.  Very happy birthday, Anthony, to Bono.  45 years old today.  Bono's birthday?  Yes.  Wow.  Ben made sure that was on our prep sheet today. 
[02:49:00]  Of course he did.  He's invited to the party.  He's actually holding the surprise party.  Ah, surprise, man.  He's actually going to jump out of the cake, or fall into it.  I can't just...  Don't have some...  Happy birthday, to Bono.  You want to do the Nathaniel stand-up stuff?  Yeah.  From the comedy show?  Very proud.  Come on in, Nathan.  Nathaniel, big winner.  Part of a comedy competition.  A lot of you comics start in those things, don't you?  I've only done one competition, because I don't like them, but I mean, you do a lot of  these bringer shows and stuff, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  A lot of them start that way.  Sure.  My buddy, Adam Ferrara, I remember one in Comac, when he first started, went there  and won, won a trip to L.A. to perform in L.A. somewhere.  It was, like, a pretty big deal.  He went there and just blew away everybody.  Yeah.  Was there.  Very, very good.  I bet you Nathaniel also won a trip to L.A., huh?  No.  No?  Not so much.  Not so much.  I won four free spots at the new talent night at the Cellar for the next four weeks. 
[02:50:00]  L.A., that.  Yeah.  Sure.  Why not?  It's a good start.  Why not?  Free performance time's good in front of a real audience instead of open mic crap, so.  It certainly is.  And moving on, fella.  Yeah.  I like that.  Look out at Hollywood.  We like Nathaniel's stand-up.  Yeah.  And he won the competition, and we got some tracks here.  I haven't heard his act in a while.  Let's see how he's progressing.  All right.  Very nice.  The next person coming to the stage, very, very funny, very tall. 
[02:50:30]  Plays all over the place.  Please give it up for Nathaniel Bryan.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  Bye.  I don't know anybody here, I promise.  Bye.  Hey.  Does anybody else's mom get a huge kick out of humiliating them?  Yes. 
[02:51:00]  Okay, good.  I'm safe here.  Mine does.  She likes to point out my place of conception every time we drive by it, which is gross.  It's a little disturbing when you're 12, you've got your new girlfriend in the car, she's  going to the 8th fairway.  There you go.  Killing them.  You're killing them.  Very good.  Good audio quality.  I know.  I warned you guys it might not be that good. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, but what, did you hide the tape recorder in your hiney?  Yes, I did.  Put it on the piano.  I did.  I did.  I put it right on the piano.  I guess there were some problems there.  Like listening to the new arm stairs from here.  See, it's time way down.  I've seen a store.  God, you knew we were going to play this on the air.  You would think you would set this up nice for yourself. 
[02:52:00]  It's the best quality I could have done.  A Ford?  Yes.  A little Radio Shack tape recorder or something.  Is it a mini recorder?  Yeah.  Those things stink.  Well, it's a digital thing, though, so I thought it would be something.  Yeah, the digital always helps out.  Oh, Tony Danza crashing.  Here we go.  Some of the video is on the news.  Here we go.  Oh, oh.  Oh, gee, how great would it be if his neck was broken?  Look at this.  Look at Tony.  Who lost?  Rusty Wallace is the boss. 
[02:52:30]  He's a base planter.  Tony, he's okay.  And thank God, America needs him.  Oh, good line.  Got him.  Yeah.  All right.  So, a couple of these come to mind as I look up and see a young man up in his stand.  You know, number one, I should have been wearing a helmet.  That's number one.  But the reason I wasn't, just so you know,  it was, there's another reason.  I mean, there's another lesson in here.  Because Rusty Wallace didn't want to wear a helmet  because he didn't want his NASCAR friends to see him in a go-kart with a helmet on. 
[02:53:00]  So then he wasn't going to wear one, so I couldn't wear one.  So then peer pressure got me, too.  So, you know, wear a helmet.  Don't wear it.  Please wear a helmet.  And I tell my daughter all the time, wear a helmet.  But wear a helmet.  And it's a bad example.  My aunts called me.  I got calls from my aunts.  By the way, I forgot an aunt yesterday.  I forgot my Aunt Alice and my Aunt Sadie yesterday.  So I'm sorry about that.  Listen, there's dribble.  But there is one thing I kind of like about it.  You notice when I go over how my hair flies?  That's why he didn't wear a helmet, by the way. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  He knew he looked like a doofus with a helmet on.  Damn it, why didn't he snap that arm?  Can you imagine him in the Christopher Reeve chair?  Oh, hey, they scooped my shit out of a bag.  Somebody else called me.  Somebody else called me and said, is that the crash you've been talking about?  No.  It's the movie crash.  Remember that, folks.  Yeah, see that movie.  It's terrific.  Let's see.  Oh, what was last night?  Last night was 24. 
[02:54:00]  That was great.  Bye.  He's good, man.  I'm well.  That guy can spin a tail.  Can't he?  You know his people got together and went, Tony, this video's going to be all over the  world today and you're not wearing a helmet.  What about the kids?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  What about the kids now?  You're going to have to come up with something for your show.  Why you weren't wearing a helmet?  Bad example for the children, Tony.  He wasn't wearing a helmet because he didn't want his hair to be old.  My hair, it's got to look good.  The hair had to look good.  Everyone looks like a doofus when you wear a helmet and he knew that just like the regular 
[02:54:30]  guy out there like us.  He would have just smashed his head.  Dude, that arm almost snapped.  You saw that?  The arm could have snapped.  He'd only been on the LIE with Harry Chapin in that little go-kart.  A little tractor trailer.  We're driving Jane Mansfield somewhere.  Two heads.  See, I got one in.  I had to.  Of course you did.  You want to try another track from this?  Oh, yeah.  We want to give you some time, Nathaniel, but the recording is a little off.  It is pretty bad. 
[02:55:00]  And you do a joke about the N-word?  Yeah.  Well, it involves the N-word.  Yes.  I want to hear that.  I was actually, so it was a kind of sheltered lifestyle.  I didn't really get exposed to racial discrimination until I was a younger age.  I was actually working construction for summer because that's what crappy douchebags  like me do for me to feel better about myself.  And I was spreading hay, and I was, I was, I went on business, and this guy was spreading  hay with me and he goes, I hate doing this nigger work.  I was like, whoa.  I was shocked, obviously. 
[02:55:30]  He saw the look in my face.  He's like, not that I've got anything against niggers.  I was like, dude, sir, I thought you were a racist for a second there.  I was like, buddy, you know, we don't use that term where I'm from.  We say those people.  You son of a bitch.  Wow.  It was a big chance I took using the old n-word in my stand-up, but yeah, it worked. 
[02:56:00]  Pretty risky.  I defeated a gay man, you guys would be happy to know.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Nice.  Trounced him good.  How was this judge?  With your keys in a tube sock?  A steamy shower.  Right.  It was an applause-o-meter kind of thing, so I'd say, you know, say the person's name and  clap for it.  He brought all of his boisterous friends.  Right, flamboyance.  Things who were, yeah.  Bunch of fucking disingenuous queens clapping. 
[02:56:30]  Yuck.  But I eked them out, edged them out, I guess.  And you didn't bring people down there?  No, I brought lots.  You did?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I brought my whole jujitsu contingent, which did a wonderful job.  How long have you taken jujitsu?  About two and a half years.  Are you good at it?  I'm okay.  Tossed me around a hotel for a few bucks?  Sure.  That's very good.  He's on his way.  No, I like it.  Congratulations, Nathaniel.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I like his delivery.  Yeah.  We're hoping to get about 15 minutes out of that, but the quality stinks. 
[02:57:00]  Sorry.  No, that's all right.  It's the way it should be for radio.  You know, the audio doesn't have to be good.  No, not at all.  Just bring the thing up in your pocket and hope it does well.  See you, buddy.  The visual's good.  That's what counts for radio.  Yeah.  What's cooking?  I don't know.  What's next door?  No, I'm saying that'd be cool.  I mean, like, what's going on?  Wait, how is something next door?  Yeah, it's a window.  What is that?  The steakhouse next door.  Yeah.  Even later in the afternoon, you really smell it.  Whatever that scent comes into here. 
[02:57:30]  Across the street?  Comes into here, yeah.  Goes through the whole...  We're in an airlock in here.  How the hell is...  I was going to call him out on it, but...  It's hamburgers and steak.  Yeah, no one could cook that well around here.  That smells really good.  It's making me hungry.  Everyone knows the smell of Moogoo Guy pan rises at 300 feet per second.  It's Ed Norton telling time from the Chinese restaurant.  Look out the window.  Remember that?  And then he's on the train.  No.  And Ralph Cramden asked what time it was, and he looks his watch, and he asked the conductor.  He goes, are there any Chinese restaurants around? 
[02:58:00]  Because he needed a Chinese restaurant to know what time it was.  And then Ralph hits him.  He kind of goes, oh, he gets hit.  Come on, you.  Sure.  It's hysterical.

That's what you smell.  Ew.  How does that smell like meat?  How does that smell?  It smells like meat.  Steakhouse is cooking at 10 o'clock in the morning?  That's a good point.  Eric, you're a fool.  Eric.  Eric.  I said in the afternoon, you didn't really smell it.  No, you didn't.  But it smells like hamburgers or something.  It smells like macaroni and cheese.  It smells like something cooking. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, no one else in the studio thought it smelled like steak and burgers.  There's a good point across the street.  Jesus, Eric.  Just like Anthony said, we're in an airlocked studio here.  That's from Morton's in Vegas.  That weather coming from across the street.  You can't smell across the street, on the street.  If you're standing in front of this building, you can't smell that restaurant.  That is bull.  Because in the afternoon, you smell it.  Oh, hey.  He bulls you, Anthony.  I give. 
[03:01:00]  I give.  You're going to take that?  Yeah.  You're going to take that?  You're going to take that?  Good for you.  Good for you, Eric.  Here, you take this.  Kid's got balls.  I like that.  It's tough talk.  He bulled you.  That's bull.  That's bull.  What do you want?  What do you want from me?  I'm a good shot.  What can I say?  All right.  We're going to take a break.  And we'll continue.  Trying to figure out what we can do next. 
[03:01:30]  Maybe we can talk about some stuff.  Oh, that thing.  We'll do that next.  Hey, you fucking rat.  They're all rats.  A whole family of rats.  We're not breaking into the bin today, are we?  What's in the bin, Eric?  What's in the bin?  Eric, explain the bin.  What's in the bin?  What's in the bin?  That's the psycho ex-girlfriend calls.  You got them?  Oh.  46 of them, but we got them.  So just start bringing them in.  I did.  I'm bringing them right now.  Oh, my God.  Steve saves the show.  Yeah, Steve.  Steve saves the show.  Yay, Steve.  Steve saves the show. 
[03:02:00]  We were going into make-up shit for 45 minutes.  The box.  What's in the bin?  Yeah, Eric, explain the bin.  The bin is stuff we've collected since day one.  From the restaurant?  Is there a steak in there?  No.  So material that we've never got to that isn't time sensitive.  So it sits in the box, and when we have days like this, we can pull something out of the box.  Oh, let me see what's in the box.  Grab bag from the old days in school.  And then I'm just going to reach in the box and grab a bit.  Grab something out of the box. 
[03:02:30]  Don't look.  Don't look, Opie.  Don't look.  Is it mostly CDs?  Yeah, CDs.  I just want you to grab something completely at random.  All right, here we go.  What is that?  All right, what do you got?  Tinkle drinking audio.  Audio from video of girl drinking pee.  All right.  Pop it in and let's give a listen.  There's a time killer.  I like the band.  I like this new band.  That's something.  I didn't even know we had this, Eric.  All right.  Tinkle drinking audio.  Audio from video of girl drinking pee. 
[03:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Cue it up.  All right.  Can't not take piss in the face and not taste it.  It's impossible.  It's true.  Tell everybody that you want everybody to come piss in your face.  Everyone should come piss in my face.  Why are you, why?  You're a?  Whore.  But it steps down a whore.  A piss-facing whore.  A piss.  By the way, today's show is sponsored by Real Audio.  Oh.  For all your audio needs, it's real audio.  God, we've had the worst quality audio today. 
[03:03:30]  Face whore, not a piss-facing whore.  Piss-facing whore.  You ready?  Lean your head back.  Open your mouth a little bit.  You're kind of blacked anyway.  You just blast.  I'm blasting, baby.  But I have to do it.  Open your mouth, please.  Open it, please.  Open it.  Open your mouth, please.  That's a big girl.  You're not going to drink any of that? 
[03:04:00]  Open your mouth, please.  Cover it now.  You need something for your eyes?  Look at me.  Look at me, please.  Look at me.  Open it up.  Not too good.  Open it up.  They're burning.  Open it up, and I'll do it in a second.  Look at me.  Lean your head back.  Someone dry it off so everybody else can piss in their face, please.  There you go, sweet pie.  You want more?  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Dry your eyes, please.  Please, this guy is so creepy.  How about, well, LP dying a piss in your face, and then, go, LP.  Oh, shit.  Brace is up.  There you go.  Can I keep asking you?  You ready to finish?  You ready to finish?  Give me your piss, please.  Say please again.  Go easy.  Say please again.  Sing my acting king.  Give me your piss.  Wow.  Where do you go wrong as a parent? 
[03:05:00]  Black guy's pissing on your daughter.  Yeah, that's your little girl.  What's that you say?  Is there some more?  Oh, wait.  I don't know.  They talked about it.  They might come up with a little more.  Let somebody else step in here for a second.  Okay.  Okay.  We coming back?  I'll be back in a second.  Oh, shit.  Stand in and take him.  All right.  Here it goes.  Open that mouth.  Open the mouth.  No.  No.  No.  No rock.  Oh, ho. 
[03:05:30]  I didn't think I did.  Yeah, you did.  There we go.  Take a break.  Maybe I can taste a little bit more, too.  Ready?  One more?  Of course.  Oh, shit.  It's burnt, huh? 
[03:06:00]  How did I do, Daddy?  I don't think, Daddy, you'd be pretty proud.  Are you proud, Daddy?  You know we are, right?  Can I shower now?  No.  Shower doesn't work.  Good.  I'll take a shower on my shower now.  Nah, we're kidding.  Oh, those are hockey kids.  Bye-bye.  I found a great website, by the way.  Yeah? 
[03:06:30]  It's about these girls  that go to strip shows,  male strip shows,  and it's real footage  of girls at these strip shows  and the guys,  they're blowing the guys,  the dancers.  Yeah, strippers and cheaters  or something it's called.  It's the hottest website ever.  Wow.  I don't know what the address is.  Maybe you could find it.  But you could tell it's real footage.  The guys are running around.  They're male dancers  putting, like,  whipped cream on their mules  and the girls kind of, like,  lick it off and suck it off.  And then there's some girls  that really will give them  head behind a towel 
[03:07:00]  or whatever.  It is the hottest.  Because some of the girls  are hot.  Some of them are awful.  It's to be the best website  around right now.  Ever.  Okay.  As we get there,  give, um,  what's his name over here?  Anthony.  The bin of bits.  Oh, I get to pick one?  Yeah.  All right.  This is stuff we never got to.  Hopefully it's not a long,  involved bit.  I'm just going to take  between these two.  Oh, boy. 
[03:07:30]  There's a lot of stuff  on that one.  Let's take this one.  Let's see what it says.  You could pass on it,  by the way.  Um, yeah,  this is kind of dated.  What is it?  It's an Arnold Schwarzenegger  on This Week  with George Stephanopoulos  from February.  Do you know  we never talk about the show?  It's not pissing in the face.  Remember the Arnold movie?  Right.  We never did that.  That was an awful movie.  Let's, uh...  I never did it. 
[03:08:00]  Anthony's got to pick one  that makes sense.  I'll pick another one.  Here we go.  Try this one.  Um,  Michael Landon outtakes.  Oh, that's got to be a hoot.  What the hell is that?  Michael Landon outtakes.  And Barry White cursing.  And Barry White cursing.  All right.  All right.  Let's see what that's all about.  What kind of Michael Landon  outtakes are there?  I got cancer of the foot.  Cut, stupid.  Oh, let's take a listen.  Ready? 
[03:08:30]  Michael Jordan.  Michael Jordan?  Oh, Michael Jordan.  Michael Jordan outtakes.  What?  Let me see that.  I got to see how that's written.  It says Michael Jordan, Anthony.  Jesus.  You racist.  No, that looks like Michael Landon  with a backwards L.  All right.  I'm an asshole.  Michael Jordan outtakes.  Michael Landon was a great  basketball player.  He really was.  Ready?  Ready?  One action. 
[03:09:00]  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  That's great.  Wait.  No.  Gatorade.  I got to hear it.  Is it in you?  Right.  Ready?  Is it in you?  Ready?  Gatorade.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  No.  No.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it?  Gatorade.  Is it in you? 
[03:09:30]  Nope.  One more time.  Try the last thing you just said.  Just conversational.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  All right.  Ready?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Okay.  Ready?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Oh, my God.  No, I don't like that.  Shut up.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Okay.  Cha-ching, cha-ching.  Gatorade.  Is it in you? 
[03:10:00]  There it is.  You did a couple great ones.  I love the really sports book Gatorade.  Oh, the kiss-ass.  You did a couple great ones.  You gave me a lot to choose from.  Thank you.  Where'd you get those rich voice outtakes?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  And what's the other one?  Barry White cursing?  Mm-hmm.  Hi, this is Barry White.  Please join me on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for the first, for the first fucking thing.  I'm cutting the fucking spot, Joey.  Tease. 
[03:10:30]  Hi, this is Barry White.  And Paul Quinn College cordially invites you to a weekend in Texas on Friday, Saturday, one more time.  Shit.  Do it, old fucker.  Hi, this is Barry White.  And Paul Quinn College cordially invites you to a beautiful weekend in Waco, Texas, on Friday.  This asshole, this asshole, fuck these words up, man.  I mean, he's got words that he don't even need.  Hi, this is Barry White.  Fuck this shit, man. 
[03:11:00]  I'm going to lay, cut this shit off.  Hi, this is Barry White.  And Paul Quinn College cordially invites you to a beautiful weekend on Friday, Saturday.  Ain't this a bitch?  Ain't this a bitch?  Hi, this is Barry White.  And Paul Quinn College.  Oh, God, Jesus.  That's funny. 
[03:11:30]  That's pretty good.  He has a deep voice.  Yes, he does.  Barry White, baby.  Says Eric Logan.  I was just thinking that.  Hi, this is Barry White.  Jim?  Yes, Hope?  Pick a bit from the bin.  Don't look, though.  Well, I don't know.  Hawk, how about bringing the goddamn bin over?  Where's the goddamn bin?  Property of the United States Postal Service.  Thief.  Oh, uh-oh.  That looks like a lot of stuff on there.  Original song about boobs.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh. 
[03:12:00]  Got the worst one.  Original song about boobs.  All right.  What's it called?  Eric, Nathaniel, and Danny.  Let's take a look.  Oh, my God.  This is going to be awful.  Oh, this is going to be hilarious, though.  All right, let's see.  Throw it over here.  Written by Ronald J. Johnson.  Arranged by Chris Albert.  Radio edit, dance mix, or the instrumental.  Which one do we want?  I'd say the, uh...  Well, why would you want the instrumental?  Obviously.  What does tit sound like?  I guess it's the radio edit. 
[03:12:30]  That means it's going to have all sorts of bleeps and stuff.  Uh, by the way, Tony Danz is getting in a dunking booth.  Oh, what do I do?  Do I climb?  Oh, what do I do?  What do you think you do?  I took my watch, Sean.  This is in my neighborhood.  We should be doing an assault on the media right now.  Very graceful.  I hope he smacks his head on the back of the board he's sitting on.  What's up?  Please.  Uh, I've got to get to the edge of this thing. 
[03:13:00]  Now, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hang on.  What's her name?  I played poker with her.  Yeah, she was on the show.  Fatfish.  Yeah.  All right, let's take Betts.  Cameron Mannheim.  Let's take Betts.  Let's take Betts.  She's not going to hit the target, but she's going to run up and push him in anyway.  You think she's going to have to do that?  Cameron, let's see.  Miss.  Miss.  Miss.  Miss.  How much time do I have at?  Oh, she gets 30 seconds, though.  Oh, my God, is she awful. 
[03:13:30]  45.  It hurts your mouth and you're throwing food at her.  That's awful.  30 seconds left to get Tony Danza into the dunk tank.  Miss.  She's missing right.  Miss.  Come on, you fat ass bitch.  And the great thing is that it's actually filled with Arthur X's blood.  Oh, she stinks.  She is awful.  That target is huge.  Oh, she's throwing him at Tony now.  Oh, she's incorrigible.  Oh, that's funny.  Miss.  Ten seconds ago, Anthony, before I guarantee she runs up and knocks him in. 
[03:14:00]  Here we go.  She's missing.  This is going to be that old guy.  Three, two, one.  Run up.  She missed.  Come on, run up and hit it.  Run up.  Run up.  Run up.  Give you one more shot.  One more.  One more.  Come on.  I think you can do it.  Look, I'm ready, folks.  And there she goes, moving up to the target.  And she's hit it.  That was a big fucking surprise.  The devil.  Boy, Ope, you didn't see that coming?  Unbelievable.  All right, look.  Yeah.  If they wanted to make this interesting, they should have had that dumb Dago holding a toaster 
[03:14:30]  that was plugged in.  There it is.  One of the hottest shows in America.  There it is.  Doing hack stuff.  Boy, Ope.  I'm surprised you didn't see that she was going to run up and hit it herself.  You kept saying, oh, she's going to keep throwing until she hits it, I guess.  Here's an original song about boobs from the Bin-O-Bits. 
[03:15:00]  Jimmy's pick.  Oh, that's a nice tempo.  Move to this one.  When I was just a baby, I became a connoisseur.  My therapist thinks maybe that's my problem.  I'm not sure.  But a man who's wise must realize what he loves most in life.  To be true to his own self and to be honest with his wife.  It's not as bad as I thought it would be, though. 
[03:15:30]  And when I meet her late, I should always show respect.  So I lock my eyes on her eyes so they don't slide down her neck.  If I go there, I start to stare, and she's aware I've lost my wits.  She's got a good head on her shoulder, and I'm there talking to her lips, which I love. 
[03:16:00]  He loves tits.  Oh, man.  He loves tits.  I always have.  I always will.  It never quits.  Big or small, I love them all.  If I could have them all to wall, I would be a happy baby.  I love tits.  I love the way they jiggle.  And I love the way they feel.  I love the way they were made to make an instant feel.  I love Hawaiian style. 
[03:16:30]  Color, tits, and sound.  And babies of all ages know the thing.  I love tits.  He loves tits.  I love tits.  He loves tits.  I always have.  I always will.  It never quits.  Big or small, I love them all.  If I could have them all to wall, I would be a happy baby.  I love them.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  When you're dressed, I like them best in how you write as well. 
[03:17:00]  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  Are you going to do it all day?  We're twins sometimes.  How come there's no more boobs on?  Well, there you go.  That was probably the best Dice bit, when he would make somebody do something. 
[03:17:30]  No, do that thing. Do the thing.  What thing? You know, do that thing you were just doing. Do it again.  And you do it again, and you go, what, are you going to do it all day?  It was funny when Dice did it.  I liked it.  Yeah.  All right, until next time, why don't we close the bin of bits?  I like that bin of bits.  Eric, why don't you place the bin back next to the lesbian cowards?  Until next time. 
[03:18:00]  Until next time.  That could be a fun feature on the show, bin of bit Tuesday.  Oh!  Shwagay.  You know, guys, that wasn't a bad song, man.  It's kind of like Banana Phone.  It's going to be on everyone's lips later.  Yeah, people are saying, is this Rafi?  Think about it.  The Banana Phone song?  It wasn't that bad, actually.  Hey, guys, real quickly.  Yesterday, you were talking about the misleading cover art in video games.  Yeah.  There was nothing worse, however, than mid-'80s porn and deception of cover art.  Because I remember being in the back of the video rental stores for an hour just trying  to pick out the right one.  Mm-hmm.  And what was the problem? 
[03:18:30]  Oh, it was so misleading.  Yeah, it never matched up.  He's actually on to something.  Think about it.  I mean, I remember looking for the Tracy Lords before she became illegal.  And she'd be in it for like two minutes, giving her head.  That's it.  And she'd be all over the cover.  Think about that.  I like the fact that you spent hours looking, you dartbag.  Yeah, but come on, Jimmy, you never did that back in the mid-'80s?  Of course I have, but I know I'm filthy.  I do it now.  Oh, okay, fine.  I think every kid, every teenager.  Let me say this.  I was saying the same thing that you said earlier.  Your hair did look good. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, look, it's flat.  Look, it's flat.  I mean, I like your auntie's.  Wear a helmet.  Wear a helmet.  No, I know that.  I know that.  I don't tell you something.  It's funny that in order to get a little publicity, all you got to do is almost kill yourself.  It's really something.  You're on everything.  So, welcome.  Welcome.  Who is she?  She's actually really good.  She's a sportscaster.  Really?  Yeah, she's really good.  And then, isn't she joining, like, Good Morning America or something?  She started as a sportscaster.  I don't know, whatever.  Who cares?  You know that?  Yeah, I know.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch. 
[03:19:30]  Cigars and Scotch.  Hey, you guys are struggling today, so I've got a little filler for you.  Yeah.  I'm requesting a story from the olden days that you weren't able to talk about.  It involved a merger.  Hillary Clinton and you guys almost getting fired.  We never got the full story on that.  Wait, Hillary Clinton?  You guys played some type of a goof on her during an Infinity merger?  Oh, the White House call.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  We called up the White House. 
[03:20:00]  Well, she was running for senator.  When she was running for senator of New York, she wanted to make like she was one of the New Yorkers.  One of us.  You know, very into everything that New Yorkers are into.  So, we had World Series tickets, Yankee World Series tickets, and we wanted to give them to Hillary because she's such a Yankee fan, which was, you know, bullshit.  So, we called up the White House to get in touch with her and put it on the air. 
[03:20:30]  Like, as we made the call, we just kind of let it fly over the air.  Which is probably one of the stupidest things you could do in radio because, you know, there's a whole thing about phone calls and we're calling down to Washington, the White House.  Yeah, you have to ask permission before they're on the air.  You can't do it on the air.  You used to be able to call people and go, hi, we're on the air.  Would you speak with us?  And if they said no, then you hang up.  But then they changed the law again and you couldn't even ask on the air.  So, a lot of times you would call on the air. 
[03:21:00]  You'd say, hi, we're on the air.  Can you speak with us?  And if they said no, you would dump out of it and hang up the phone.  We just let it fly.  And we talked to somebody that picks up the phone at the White House, the little runaround that we had trying to get in touch with Hillary.  And apparently it got to some people.  While they were trying to do a merger.  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot all about that.  It was the Infinity Viacom.  Merger, right?  Hook up. 
[03:21:30]  Forgot about that one.  Did that eventually work out?  Not really.  Yeah, right?  Radio, the radio division stinks and they're trying to get rid of most of it.  They're ready to spin it off.  All right.  I think that's about all, Cigars and Scotch.  Yeah.  I think there's more to it.  I just don't remember now.  It wound up getting to the FCC.  There was some kind of problem.  You think?  All they had to do was walk down the hall and say, hey, we're having a problem right now.  What are these idiots?  Listen in.  All right, Cigars and Scotch.  Thanks.  I wish there was more to that, but I think that's about it there.  Why don't we take a break? 
[03:22:00]  We're going to regroup and finish the O.P. and Anthony show next.  Life in corporate America can be a grind.  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this direction feeling silly.  You're going to need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from the Hiv Corporation.  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training. 
[03:22:30]  Maybe you could send someone from Human Resources in and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area.  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan.  Greed is good.  He'll guide you through the hiring process.  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations.  Here's what you do, stupid.  When they complain, you go, click.  You take the phone.  Click.  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations.  You send them to training to not have those big kids showing during the workday.  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor. 
[03:23:00]  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule?  And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships.  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And he'll also assist with time management.  130, Human Resources, attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  135, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor.  Ha ha!  End of meeting.  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook. 
[03:23:30]  Order today.  Meeting adjourned.  Oh, Black City, Bambalam.  Yeah, Black City, Bambalam.  Black City, got a job.  Bambalam, dancing, going wild.  Bambalam, she's always with her.  Bambalam, she's on Rock City.  Bambalam, we're a Black City.  Bambalam, yeah, Black City.  Bambalam.  Unbelievable.  Hi, you're on the air.  Hey, it's me.  Hi.  I'm so fucking into you. 
[03:24:00]  I don't do this for a living.  It's fucking new to me.  I mean, I don't know what this guy wants from me.  I want you badly.  I know you want me.  It's fucking I have sex.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Dude, get with it.  I'm so fucking into you.  Give me an original idea.  I mean, I've done it all.  I don't want you to.  I don't want you to.  Oh, my God.  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell him, Fred.  I want to fucking...  Fuck you and lick your ass. 
[03:24:30]  I'm so fucking into you.  It's incredible.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  All right.  Bye.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  You're making some faces over there, Anthony.  Ah, this guy clicked on a link here off of FARC.  It was one of those not safe for work links.  Okay.  And it turned out to be nude men.  Grr. 
[03:25:00]  When that pops up, you're like, oh, Jesus.  Not the picture of the three guys in the bed, the three really old guys.  Have you seen that one yet?  No.  Oh, my God.  I'll have to send it to you.  You ever have some dumbbell?  So you can enjoy it, too.  It's three guys.  Make my wallpaper.  It's three naked gay guys that have to be 75 to 80.  The one guy is laying back.  The one guy is blowing them.  The guy who's getting blown, his eyes are in the back of his head like, oh, and then there's 
[03:25:30]  another guy with his dick in the picture.  It's just the worst.  Oh, God.  And, of course, it's, you know, hot chick here or whatever, and you click on it, and you  get a little surprise.  You ever get the guy bent over, opening his asshole?  Yeah.  Oh, that is really bad.  Yeah.  That's old school, man.  We used to get that thousands of times.  Just huge and red and nasty like a mandrel ass.  The fist could go in there without even touching the sides.  It's so freaking wide. 
[03:26:00]  I've seen a lot of traffic.  It sure has, Jimmy.  All right.  We got some clips from Psycho X Girlfriend.  All right.  I want to thank somebody for sending this in to us.  Was it Dan from Hoboken?  Yeah, it was one of the people that said they were sending in.  Well, thanks for helping out the show.  Basically, this was from a website, and this guy took all the voicemails from his  ex-girlfriend, Psycho X Girlfriend, and put them up on the website for everyone else's  listening pleasure, Anthony. 
[03:26:30]  So we could get through a few of these.  I have 50.  50?  And some, no one has because he got a cease and desist and had to take off some really,  really rank ones, I guess.  Oh.  But we still have a fine sample of calls from this ex-girlfriend.  I'm going to check.  I have no new messages.  Saved messages.  Saturday, February 3rd, 9.09 AM.  You better fucking call me back on my cell phone.  I'm done doing this thing with you, chasing you, until the part where you'd exhaust me. 
[03:27:00]  Well, you have already.  What the fuck are you doing?  So if you really want it to be over?  Is that what you want?  Are you going to be a happy boy then?  No, I guess so.  That's what you told me.  So I guess I should just listen to that.  Call me back, Mark.  You better call me soon, because I'm done chasing you.  I can't express this to you enough.  You know, sometimes you only do this so many times, and then it just becomes fucking old, 
[03:27:30]  doesn't it?  That's that one.  All right.  Oh, we're just warming up.  I was a little angry.  I love that we can play these uncensored.  The beauty of satellite radio.  Back in the old days, beep, beep.  But according to Rolling Stone magazine, the beauty of satellite radio is shock jocks Opie  and Anthony can curse all they want on the radio these days.  That's about all you get from satellite radio.  What do you expect from that dumb magazine?  I mean, they haven't written a relevant thing in 30 years. 
[03:28:00]  I enjoy the Rolling Stone, actually.  I never liked it.  I still enjoy the Rolling Stone.  They're awful.  If they put Sabbath on the cover.  Yeah, but they wouldn't.  Why would they?  Wouldn't this Aussie win an award for biting a bat?  You predictable faggots.  You fucking left-wing political ideology.  Consistently boring.  Ugh.  A little loyalty.  It's just awful.  All right.  Here's another clip.  Page message.  Saturday, February 3rd, 9th, 12th, AM.  Share this. 
[03:28:30]  I know you're checking your messages.  I can tell.  Right now, it's 10 after 9.  And since now, you've tortured me all day and night.  You better fucking call me back, Mark.  You better fucking call me back.  If you want any chance of ever working this out with me, I swear to God,  I've done every fucking thing that I could possibly do.  So are you happy?  Are you happy? 
[03:29:00]  You just go out there and booze it up on your own.  Okay?  If I came over to see you and you denied seeing me again.  Okay!  And I was even coming over to you after apologizing to you,  after doing all those things, saying all those things on the phone to you  that mean absolutely fucking nothing.  So I hope you're happy.  I hope you're happy being a lonely guy.  Oh, but wait.  I know you've got a lot of dates, so maybe you won't be that lonely. 
[03:29:30]  Well, you know what?  I've done everything I fucking can.  You want to be with me?  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah, you want to be with me.  Thanks for showing me.  I think she's hurt.  Can we play this message?  I talked to Eric Logan, and he seems to think that she's trying to get back with this guy.  What was this quote again? 
[03:30:00]  Because that was way in the beginning of the show.  Oh, really?  It was amazing.  He picked this thing out.  This is from the Rolling Stone.  We've been talking about the Rolling Stone article on Satellite Radio off and on this morning,  and our big boss is quoted as well.  So, you thought we had a great quote.  Logan gets, like, right to the meat of the issue.  He says, if you have a hit-driven channel, people are going to hang out there.  Boom.  Right there.  There you go.  Yeah.  He should call in and defend himself. 
[03:30:30]  Against what?  He made the right statement.  Here's another.  Do you know what year these are, by the way?  This goes back a few years now.  We played them about four years ago.  Sage message.  Saturday, February 3rd, 9th, 15 p.m.  All I can say is, if you're out at a fucking bar, when I went to your house, drove by you,  you saw me, and you just drove by me, and I called you to apologize, to tell you how much 
[03:31:00]  I meant to you, how much you meant to me, if you're out at a fucking bar right now, I will  never, ever forgive you, ever, because if you could be having a good time, then you know  what, fuck you, and you know what, you're right, then I need to move on, but I hope you know what  you're doing, because I'm not fucking playing around anymore, you know, what do you think,  the world is going to fucking chase you forever, Mark, that you know what, everybody's going 
[03:31:30]  to fucking chase you, because you're Mr. Wonderful, yeah, well you've got some flaws going on yourself,  so you know what, when I call you and apologize, they call you a million times to tell you how  much you mean to me, that should mean something, but obviously it doesn't, so you fucking have  a good time out of the fucking bar, but I'll tell you what, if you're there, don't ever fucking  call me again, she laid down the law, to replay this message, it's amazing what people will say 
[03:32:00]  in grief, like just what idiots people become, like if you think the whole world's just going to  run around chasing you forever, like what, he didn't say that, he's in a bar drinking, trying to get  away from you, yeah, well, that's the third call, there's 50 of these, saved message, Saturday,  February 3rd, 9, 29 p.m., well, you won, not only have you ruined my day, but you've ruined my night, 
[03:32:30]  because I'm too upset to even think about going out to have fun, fun, I want to be with you,  and I want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with me, so, yeah, that would be a real good  time out tonight, huh, anyway, I know that I've got to move on, and I'm going to, and mark my words,  if I don't hear from you shortly, I'm moving on, because I'm not going to play this game tomorrow,  and I know I keep saying that, and I know I keep calling you back, but it's fucking draining,  Mark, and I'm tired of it, and I've chased after you, once again, all fucking day, and all fucking 
[03:33:00]  night, so, you know what, have fun with your fucking stubbornness, and you know what, I hope the  next fucking woman that you date, or girl, maybe I should say, puts up with your stubbornness,  because I can't deal with it, I've given you everything, I've said to you every possible  thing that I could say, I basically came calling back, even though, you know what, it's not only  my fault, it's us, and, uh, you know what, you continue to fucking torture me, and, uh, I just hope 
[03:33:30]  that you're really having a good time, and I know you're probably not, so, whatever, I hope you got  what you wanted from all this, because, uh, it's just fucking sad, so, um, I'm moving  on, I'm going to bed, and I am certainly moving on tomorrow morning, goodbye.  All right, well, she's moving on, that's, that's good.  She's moving on, that is nice.  These dignity salvaging things people try to say, like, hey, you know what, I don't care,  I'm going to bed, I'm moving on, come, come 2004, it's done. 
[03:34:00]  I showed you, but she didn't go to bed.  Saved message, Wednesday, February, 7th, 8, 39 p.m.  You know, and that was my biggest fear, doing this phone thing, because, you know, I was  trying to do it on good faith, knowing that you'd help me with it, and you'd make a priority,  and, you know, it would be okay, regardless, and it's not, and my cell phone's disconnected  as of tomorrow, and I need to call AT&T right now to reinstate my cell phone, and I guess 
[03:34:30]  I'm fucked, again, because, you know what, I put faith in this, us, and you helping me  out with this, and I'm not going to listen to you over voicemail, how to set up my mailbox.  There's a lot of other things on this stupid phone that I don't even know how to operate,  so I'm paying for something I don't even know how to use.  So can you do me a favor, and let me know what to do with this thing?  I don't know, and I'm not trying to be a prick, but you know what? 
[03:35:00]  I don't know what to do.  I have no cell phone as of tomorrow, because I trust in you.  Wow.  Wow.  She's taking another attack.  To replay the cell phone.  Like, well, now you've got to call me, because I've got a problem with my cell phone.  Yeah, look, I don't want to discuss the relationship or anything, but this cell phone.  Right, but you're the only one that can help me with my cell phone.  I don't have a phone because I trusted you.  Because I trusted you.  What, did he throw it out the car window or something?  You said you loved me, and now I have roaming charges. 
[03:35:30]  Jesus.  Stage message, Wednesday, February, 7th, 9th, 34 p.m.  I'm going to the hospital because I...  I'm going to the hospital.  Oh, you don't fucking care.  Wow.  You've got to fucking prove a point.  I hope you're fucking happy. 
[03:36:00]  All over a cell phone?  To replay this message, press 1.  Who saw that comment?  Why is she going to the hospital?  I don't know.  She hurt herself trying to program it, the poor thing?  Hurt her finger.  Did she break her finger now?  The poor girl.  Oh, my God.  I just busted the board here, Jill.  Put it back, please.  Oops.  I don't know.  What happened to the button?  I don't know.  You're going to have to press it to put that back on.  All right, let me try this. 
[03:36:30]  Why don't you press it?  Okay.  No.  Oh, great.  The little red light thing, the red thing came off the top.  Could Marge help out with that?  Put a watermelon Jolly Rancher back on it.  All right, hold on.  All right, let me try this.  Here you go.  Did it work?  Sage message.  Wednesday, February 7th, 9, 40 p.m.  Hey, I just want to tell you.  You know what?  I am, uh, I'm fine.  Don't worry about me.  You obviously haven't been. 
[03:37:00]  So, you, you go live your life.  All right?  I'll be fine.  And I am, uh, I'm out of here in a big way.  Like, out of here.  Okay?  Goodbye.  Wow.  All right.  So, it starts with, like, uh, you know, just call me because, uh, we're having some problems.  I think we can work that out.  That tack didn't work.  So, then she goes with the, I have a problem with my cell phone.  That didn't work.  Then she's got the whole, you know, medical emergency thing. 
[03:37:30]  Going to the hospital.  And, uh, now it sounds like she's like, ah, don't even worry about it.  I'm just going to kill myself.  Look, I'm fine.  Uh, don't need you.  I'm done with you.  Unbelievable.  Good luck.  Sage message.  Wednesday, February 7th, 9, 41 p.m.  Um, oh, and by the way, I just realized, you know, if you're worried about me doing anything  crazy, I'm not going to because I value my life too much. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, that was wrong.  Don't worry.  I would never kill myself, especially over you.  So, I'll be fine.  Okay?  Goodbye.  Ah, see?  I thought she was threatening suicide, but that, that is to put in his head, oh, she might  kill herself.  Whenever you have to call someone and go, by the way, I won't be killing myself, that's  a rough relationship end.  Yeah.  You're unstable.  If you have to actually tell someone that, look, I know you think I'm going to kill myself, 
[03:38:30]  well, you can forget it.  Not over you.  Maybe over the phone.  Wednesday, February 7th, 9, 53 p.m.  Well, you know, I, I just don't, I don't understand how you could be so mean, but I guess if you  could be this mean right now, you'll be even worse if we were ever to be married.  And, it's a good thing I'm learning this now, because you sure don't have any soft spot in 
[03:39:00]  your heart.  I'm trying to use that ground.  You know what?  Unless it's your way.  And I can honestly say, I, I don't hate a lot of people, but I hate you.  Because, you know what?  You've tortured me.  Oh, boy, here we go.  And you've made me feel like shit.  And you've said it verbally.  You know, I, I never profess to be perfect, Mark, but you know what?  I would never tell you that I don't want to be with you.  I would never do things without you and run away and tell you I don't feel the same way 
[03:39:30]  anymore and I don't care.  And, you know what?  You've pretty much done all.  So, I guess this is what you wanted.  I guess you want me to hate you.  So, you've made it pretty easy.  And, you are the one person that I've had here that I really, truly thought cared about  me.  But, what I've learned recently, it's very conditional.  It's, it's all conditional with you. 
[03:40:00]  You know what?  And, unless I'm the perfect girlfriend, you've got a problem with it.  And, I hate you for it, because you've tortured me.  And, I've told you all along that the only thing I wanted to do was work this out.  And, I knew I was wrong.  But, you know what?  I guess you've got a problem with the fact that, you know, I would want you to admit  you're wrong. 
[03:40:30]  I don't even know what the fuck I'm saying.  I don't even know why I'm wasting my breath on you.  Someone who doesn't give a flying shit about me.  So, you know what?  I hope this is how you want us to end up.  It's a pretty good scene, isn't it?  Hey, you little man!  You make me want to vomit!  Wow. 
[03:41:00]  You had best un-fuck yourself, or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck!  Your neck!  Do we have time for more?  I can't get enough of these things.  I haven't heard these in years.  We have more than two minutes?  We're running out of show?  This one's like two and a half minutes long.  We can't make that.  Alright, if we start now, we can get this in.  Stage message.  Wednesday, February 7th, 9th, 57th p.m. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, and by the way, regarding the phone, don't worry about it.  I'll try to wait, you know, half an hour on your customer service 800 number, and maybe  someone will try to explain it to me.  Wow.  And don't worry, I won't call your boss or your boss's boss, because, you know, they  already think I'm an idiot.  Oh, he works for the phone company.  So, you know, I guess I won't go there either.  So, you know, I hope you feel good in the fact that you've screwed me with this phone. 
[03:42:00]  And, yeah, I'm stuck with it in a $200 bill, I guess, huh?  So, um, I guess I'll have to figure it out.  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!  I just want to say, thanks.  Thanks for helping me.  And you don't know, you know I don't know anything about these stupid phones, and I've  been asking you for days now to show this to me, and, uh, well, I guess I'm going to  be screwed.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there! 
[03:42:30]  I'll choke yourself!  You're screwed.  I'll choke yourself!  Every fucking risk I take with you, every time I figure, okay, let's do something that  makes a statement that I trust you.  I always get burned, so, whatever.  Um, and I know your entire office thinks I'm an idiot right now, so, that's cool.  Out of the whole country, right.  Maybe they're reconfirming to you that you don't need to be with me, and maybe you don't 
[03:43:00]  even need to feel bad about any of this.  Maybe it's a big fucking mistake in your life.  And, um, whatever.  But, don't worry about me.  I just know that I fucking hate you.  I hate you because I gave you my heart and more.  I gave you my trust, even when you broke it. 
[03:43:30]  I gave you my trust and my insecurities and everything.  And you continued to just take advantage of that, even to right now.  So, do you sleep good tonight, okay?  Goodbye.  The saga will continue tomorrow.  That's only 10 of about 50.  Wow.  We're going to have to pepper them in for the rest of the week here.  I wonder if they ever got back together.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  I wonder what the backstory is to that one.  Tony from Cleveland, what's up?  Hey, man, you guys have got to stop playing this.  You're killing Bob Kelly.  Do you hear how she sounds?  Oh, that fat idiot threw up yesterday, too.  He ate bad pork.  I go to his house and he's sweating.  I think I'm going to the bathroom and he vomits after he ate weak-old pork.  Ugh.  Just laying on a bed with a fucking gimp leg.  With his big swollen knee.  Eating weak-old pork.  All right, Pinchy, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  Hey, boys, how you doing?  Hey.  Real fast.  Hey, whenever you say it's your loss, it's really not your loss. 
[03:44:30]  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Brad, what did you learn on the show today?  Today I learned that Anthony cannot work under the watchful eye of a blob doll.  That's how the show started today.  All right, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's the Anthony Show.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
