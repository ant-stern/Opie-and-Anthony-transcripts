<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's summer kickoff broadcast from the South Beach Dance Club in Island Park was a raucous affair.  The show, heavily centered around a "Wow Wet T-Shirt Contest," featured a large, enthusiastic crowd displaying numerous offensive signs.  The broadcast was punctuated by constant vulgar language and explicit references to sex and female anatomy, both during the contest commentary and in unrelated segments.  

Musical guests included Fuel (performing "Baby Raper" and “Camp Concentration”), Q (performing "Horny for Little Girls"), Anthony's brother Joe (performing the highly offensive "Just Boned My Daughter" and "Oh My Sewer," the latter plagued by technical difficulties), Stephen Lynch (performing "FBA," an extended collaborative version, and a song about a gerbil), and Billy and Paul from AirSick (performing "Kill a Fetus").  Madison, known for her previous interactions with vegetables, was a prominent guest, teasing the audience throughout the show.  Other guests included Alexis and Tracy (wet t-shirt contestants), Mikey (co-author of "FBA"), and Madison (from the Privileged Gentleman's Club).  Spaz was repeatedly dunked in an ice-filled dunk tank.  

The hosts, Opie and Anthony,  commented extensively on the crowd, the contest participants, the event's technical difficulties (including audio issues affecting Joe's performance), and the pervasive distribution of marijuana among the audience.  Numerous commercial breaks, primarily for Rockaway Betts mattresses, were interspersed with further sexually explicit commentary.  Psycho Mark and Old Dirty Bastard also made appearances (though specifics of their contributions aren't detailed). The show's radio broadcast concluded, but the event continued live at the venue, including the wet t-shirt contest finals and more performances.  The entire event was documented with photos uploaded to the WNEW website in real time.  Numerous sponsors and crew members received thanks at the end of the radio broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony summer kickoff party starts at 3. Stand by.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony. Anthony, I think you're live and ready to go.  I would think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She wants to take me out on the stage.  Nothing, Opie. That's fine. Hi, hi. How are you doing? 
[00:00:30]  We have eagerly awaiting walking out on the stage.  Remember Madison?  Of course.  Yes.  You're on Asparagus.  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  Look at...  Rick is saying we have to speak up.  No, see, he doesn't understand we are backstage right now.  Yeah.  We're supposed to hear us. They're going to hear us in a couple minutes when we go on stage.  Absolutely. Don't worry about it.  I just want to let people know that there's plenty of room at the South Beach Dance Club.  There's no line, Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  We have about 700, 800 of our listeners inside.  Plenty of room, so if you're getting out of work soon, come on down to Tylan Park, South Beach Dance Club, 50 Broadway.  And, Anthony, let's hit the stage.  Let's go. Let's see what this is like.  Come on, ladies.  Let's pause.  Oh!  Holy knuckle! 
[00:01:30]  Wow!  Oh, my God.  Hey, guys.  How's the side doing?  I'm fine.  I do believe we have a party happening in Island Park.  Look at the crowd.  Oh, my God.  Everyone with the signs.  Anthony, read some of these signs.  I see gay people like Spaz.  Welcome to the Precious and Wrangler show.  Very good, you smart ass.  So is your fun bags.  Hey, that's a good one. 
[00:02:00]  The Spaz sucks, and it's got them in various gonzo pornographic poses.  The all-time favorite.  Show us your fun bags.  Very good.  Very, very nice.  Man, there are so many freaking people here, Anthony.  I got to introduce someone to the crowd.  You guys, you're going to lose it when you hear this one.  Who was listening to the birthday show a couple days ago?  Yeah.  Do you guys remember a lady that was doing some unusual things with vegetables? 
[00:02:30]  The world's largest carrot.  And then she took some asparagus and lost her virginity to a thing of asparagus.  Yes, La Balloon Knot.  Yes.  Very good.  That's Madison from Privilege.  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Boy, they love you. 
[00:03:00]  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Madison!  Buttsick!  This guy has a huge buttsick sign.  I think the ladies are getting cheered at right now.  Madison, you want to show them something?  What do you think?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  How'd you like to mow my lawn, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The crowd's going to go wild.  It's wild in about two seconds.  Oh, she's a little tease. 
[00:03:30]  Wait, you can hang your holster on that.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Uh-huh.  Look at that.  People offering up Amex.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Very nice.  That's it.  Bravo.  And check out that sign. 
[00:04:00]  Funnier than a car full of hookers and an eight ball of coke.  Jay Moore's line.  You stole Jay Moore's line if you were a comic.  Syndication when cringe goes platinum.  Very good.  Very nice.  I like that sign.  Well, we're obviously just getting started.  We got so much going on here today, guys.  It's not even funny.  In a little while, Anthony's brother, Joe, is going to be on stage singing Oh, my sewer.  Yes.  Yeah.  Joe's going to come up and do one of the most offensive songs. 
[00:04:30]  We also have Q and Fuel going to be doing theirs.  All right.  More cans.  Also, Anthony, at 3.30, we're going to have to look up in the sky because Paul the Pilot  is going to be putting on an aerial show for everyone.  Yeah.  All right.  For the people in their cars, we're going to play the FBA thing, man.  The break that started the most offensive song contest, it was Jay Moore in the studio 
[00:05:00]  with Stephen Lynch and Mike DiNicola.  And here it is, how it unfolded, that started the most offensive song contest.  This is the FBA, all right?  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting.  It's true.  Hopefully, you have Anthony.  All right, Anthony.  We are live back on the radio.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Live from the South Beach Dance Club in Island Park.  We're behind the stage because it got just absolutely nuts out here.  We have about three people here so far.  We'll kick it off summer in style.  Hopefully, someone just handed me more weed than I have seen in so long.  I must say to any authorities, I have handed it off to somebody else right now.  But the fans are unbelievable here.  More pot than I have seen.  And a joint roll, just because I want to partake like now.  Like, I don't have time to fold it up or anything. 
[00:06:00]  It's just I have a full joint and a huge bag of weed.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's just absolutely nuts.  I also passed off my weed, Anthony.  You know, you didn't.  Any cops that are arrest Opie, he's in possession of narcotics.  I could still run really fast.  I must say, the cool thing is we've got about 7,800 listeners inside.  Yeah.  There's plenty of room still.  There is no line, which is unusual for one of our road shows.  So, if you're thinking of coming, you definitely will get in if you get here within the next hour.  Yeah, well, I'm thinking, because a lot of people don't have today off, that before 5 o'clock, it's a shoo-in. 
[00:06:30]  You're in.  After 5, when people get off of work, it's going to be a madhouse.  So, show up early.  Get here now.  Sorry, I'm distracted.  A couple more of the whores just showed up.  Oh, my God.  Opie.  No, I wasn't talking about you.  I was talking about you.  You're doing that.  Okay, anyway.  It was gone.  Still to come, Anthony, we're doing the Wow Wet T-Shirt Contest.  Yes.  We have about 12, 15 ladies that have already signed up. 
[00:07:00]  Your brother Joe is going to be on stage in a few minutes doing one of his most defensive songs for the most defensive song Contest.  Yes, probably the most defensive song.  Oh, my pure.  However, Spaz in the dunk tank, what a huge attraction for everyone here.  They hate this son of a bitch as much as everyone else that works with him does.  And he's been dunked, I think, about 100 times already.  Yeah, he came out in his Boy Scout uniform.  The crowd went nuts.  Called him an a-hole, a-hole, a-hole.  He fell in. 
[00:07:30]  The first thing he does is he pops through the surface.  He's like, oh, it's cold, it's cold.  He sits down, like two balls later, he's back in.  He's huffing and puffing.  I think he's going to die in there.  Which would be great.  Can we put Earl in next?  Well, we've got the bright idea to give a Spaz a live microphone.  Why do we use Spaz there?  That's good.  High voltage live can't fix wires right above the tank.  Yeah.  Yeah, out of their minds.  She's teasing the fact that she might do something with that whiffle ball back. 
[00:08:00]  I think it's the one.  You think?  Jesus.  Yeah, also, where's our pilot friend?  Is he around?  People scanning the skies yet?  I guess Paul the pilot is supposed to do an air show any minute now.  Yeah.  Up above the crowd.  Eagerly awaiting his aerobatics.  Look at these little takes across the road, man.  High above the smut.  They got the best seat in the house. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, they're on a lift.  Look at that.  Also, Otto and George was on stage, and the crowd's loving the Pope joke.  Yeah, they were requesting the Pope joke, yeah.  So, we're just getting started.  I mean, what's going to just be the first thing?  Yeah, get your asses down here.  They're doing the A-hole chant with somebody.  It doesn't matter who gets on stage.  At this point, I think they get the A-hole chant.  All right, but we're just going to screw it off backstage for now. 
[00:09:00]  I'm going to take a few of those hot things.  Yeah.  I don't know if she addresses 50 Broadway, because I was driving around some restaurants  and asked the listeners where the place was.  I'm like, I don't know.  We're walking around trying to find it, too.  I think everyone got lost.  What's the main street out here?  Austin Boulevard?  Austin Boulevard.  Yeah, Long Beach turns into Austin Boulevard.  That's right.  You'll see all the cars with the wow on the back.  I was driving around cursing, slamming my steering wheel.  Mother Earth, we can never find a place. 
[00:09:30]  Every time we do one of these, I get lost.  I'm like Earl.  Let's take a quick break.  Oh, dirty, real fast before we break here.  Oh, dig.  You having fun, bro?  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.  Old Dirty was just assaulting some of the girls on stage.  Sexual assault.  It was great.  You know, he's thinking you made it out today, bro.  Old Dirty, stop around those of me.  I already passed off my pot.  Is that a cigar or a pun?  Yeah, what do you got there?  Yeah.  Oh, we're taking pictures for the internet on the way. 
[00:10:00]  We did figure out how to get digital pictures on the internet.  Scott Coromo came down.  So, if you check that through any double website for our reception, you can see actual shots  from the box.  Yeah.  Pictures as they happen.  Yeah, we'll be updating them.  We're like 10-10 wins now.  News as it happens.  Boobs as they happen.  John Montone on the ones.  Traffic and boobs together on the ones. 
[00:10:30]  And Anthony.  Balloon knots on the threes.  And Anthony, as I look in the sky, it's not snowing today.  No, who was forecasting snow?  Mark Dannon, I believe.  Oh, really?  Oh, you didn't hear the latest, I guess.  No.  Mark Dannon in between the 6 and 11 o'clock news.  Yeah.  Buying coke on the streets of New York.  Whoa.  Nice.  You, my newest employee, you work in downtown Manhattan with the green card, Monty. 
[00:11:00]  This is the funniest thing.  There's a couple of magicians, Mike and Mike, walking around, doing really outrageous magic.  Old Dirty is trying to figure out a way to turn a buck with these guys.  Like, no doubt.  With two, three, come Monty.  Oh, Spaz, you look cold, man.  Turn around.  Turn around.  We got to get a picture of this for the internet.  Spaz's lips are blue.  He just got out of the dunk tank.  He has his Boy Scout uniform on.  Spaz, your hair looks completely losing it. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, look, he's drooling.  He's drooling.  He's freaking drooling, man.  Spaz, how you feeling?  Very cold.  Very cold.  What's hypothermia?  Cold.  It's nothing.  I'm numb.  I'm numb.  I'm numb.  Have you been stung by a giant mosquito?  Perhaps it's encephalitis.  Uh, I don't know.  He is freaking freezing.  And, of course, the best thing to do when you have hypothermia is drink alcohol.  That's what they suggest on the news, isn't it? 
[00:12:00]  All right.  More booze and more cold water, Spaz.  You'll be dead before the show's over.  Anthony, I was just informed before Spaz went to the dunk tank, they dumped an S-load of ice cubes into the dunk tank.  Look at his lips are blue, man.  I've never felt anything cold.  Spaz warm-up, man.  Seriously, warm-up somewhere.  Did we get a picture of that for the internet?  Look at him.  He can't even walk.  All right.  Once again, Anthony, we've got plenty of pictures from the live broadcast at WNAW.com. 
[00:12:30]  Just go to the O.P. and Anthony section.  Let's take a break, all right, Anthony?  Cool.  I mean, things like we said, just getting started here.  It's the South Beach Dance Club, Austin Boulevard, Island Park.  There is no line as we speak, and we can fit at least another 400 or 500 people in here.  So, now taunting Spaz.  Yeah, we've got to go back on stage and talk to the crowd and get Spaz up there.  So, we'll take a quick break.  We'll be back.  It's O.P. and Anthony, WNAW.  Wow.  O.P. and Anthony.  God damn genius. 
[00:13:00]  1-0-2-7-WNAW.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Oh.  Little, little lady.  Oh, we should have Joey do his own commercial.  Where is he?  He could say, come down, get the incredible pasta lunch specials, and I'll give you a free DVD player.  You'll love those, don't you, Joey?  It's Joey.  Look at that.  We're doing a read for you right now.  Joey, you're paying for this.  Oh, like yesterday. 
[00:13:30]  Right, right.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Go down, blah, blah, blah.  Good food, blah, blah, blah.  Great atmosphere, blah, blah, blah.  Ladies and gentlemen, Paisano of Mulberry Street.  You're going to love it in Little Italy.  They got the tables in the heart of Little Italy, as opposed to maybe if you get it in  the heart, I'll see if you keep this smart-ass attitude.  But incredible, authentic Italian cuisine made from original Old World recipes. 
[00:14:00]  Where'd you get those, Joey?  From the...  You would.  See?  He'll take me fishing next week and explain it to me, and I'll end up like Freda.  The portions, like we said, huge, incredible, and if you ask for Joey, you get a glass of  wine on the house.  Check it out.  Paisano of Mulberry Street, the heart of Little Italy, 1-36 Mulberry.  Give them a call.  965-1188.  965-1188.  Open seven days. 
[00:14:30]  Weekends till 2.  2!  Can't stretch.  Open till 2-2 on a Friday and Saturday.  We're talking a great place to take the family or a date.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Check it out.  We love it.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Doody-doody.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Oh, my God. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Psycho Mark, you're out of your friggin' mind.  He's out of his mind.  He's, uh...  I believe he's having sex on the stage.  He's having sex with the carrot girl, Madison, for privilege.  I hope you're packing more than an asparagus beer.  Hey, you guys having fun so far or what, huh?  This crowd is absolutely nuts.  Anthony's brother, Joe, is going to be on stage in a few minutes  doing a couple of his most offensive songs. 
[00:15:30]  Spaz, I think, has hypothermia.  Did you see him coming up all shaking and everything?  Yeah, he looks like Michael J. Fox.  Where is Spaz?  Is he getting warm somewhere or what?  Where is Spaz?  He went inside to get warm?  All right.  Ponderous.  Hey, Anthony, we also had a bunch of other fine young ladies  show up at the back door.  They wanted to get on stage.  What happened there?  Where are those girls?  Yeah, let's bring up some of those girls.  Those are the girls from the wet t-shirt contest 
[00:16:00]  that we're going to do in about an hour.  All right.  Wow, look at that.  We got some contenders down there.  Yes, that's going to be a lot of fun.  And, of course, are you guys psyched for fuel?  Fuel's going to hit the stage to do Baby Raper.  Live version of Baby Raper.  Please, no camcorders or tape recordings.  We don't want that ending up on Napster.  Because Mule is going to come after you.  Sucks to be you because we're having a great time.  But if you're home, go to the WNAW website, 
[00:16:30]  WNAW.com.  We're putting pictures of the live broadcast  up on the site every, like, 15 or 20 minutes.  Oops.  I just realized this is the on-air portion of the show, Albie.  I said the S word.  I know.  We have John the Dump Guy back at the station,  so screw him.  I mean, what do you think of John the Dump Guy?  I don't know if you can make that out at home, Anthony.  Should we try it again?  What do you guys think of John the Dump Guy?  Angie, like, well, I can't really make that out. 
[00:17:00]  I think they love him, Anthony, is what they're trying to say.  He said, love you.  Love you, I believe.  I would say John.  I don't know what he's thumping out of, but that's okay.  All right, Anthony, we're going to play a bit for everybody in their cars,  and then we'll be back live here at the South Beach Dance Club.  Island Park, Austin Boulevard, plenty of room, believe it or not.  We've got about 1,000 people here, but we could fit another 500 or 600.  So if you're thinking of coming, by all means, get your ass down here 
[00:17:30]  before the wet t-shirt contest and before everyone hits the stage  to do the most offensive songs, okay?  I love you, John.  Right now, for the people in their car, I think it's the Regis Minority bit, man,  on WNW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This happened to be one of my favorite shows.  I wanted to listen and learn.  I learned that from my ride home, I'm going to wear the pants  because I think that your show's so funny, I'm going to pee myself every day.  Another goal we have, everybody wetting their pants on their drive home.  That's a... 
[00:18:00]  Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?  1-0-2-7-W-N-A-W.  Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, my God.  Everyone here has taken stack or two.  How are you feeling?  Look at that.  Up as a pump.  I believe that every single person here took stack or two because they got a hell of a lot of energy, Anthony.  They're out of their minds and they all have to stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Anthony, it does three things.  What are the three things? 
[00:18:30]  It burns a fat.  It is the world's strongest fat burner.  Cuts down on the cravings to a snack and it gives you that boost energy you need to get you through one of these appearances.  This guy over here is saying he lost 40 pounds on stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  40 pounds on stack or two.  Very good.  Well, if you want to try stack or two for yourself, give them a call.  1-800-LIGHTLINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Our listeners have proven it works. 
[00:19:00]  And, Anthony, we are back live at the South Beach Dance Club in Island Park having a great time.  Man, what a crowd.  We have plenty of room still.  I mean, if you're in your car and you're thinking about coming down here, come on down.  You'll definitely get in.  There's no line as we speak.  We got about 800 people here.  We could fit a couple hundred more easily.  Still to come, the Wild Wet T-Shirt Contest. 
[00:19:30]  And do you want to just bring up fuel just so the crowd can get a look at them?  You guys, do you remember that song, Baby Raper?  Here's the sick F that pet that little ditty.  He's going to be performing that in a little while.  Also, the Wild Wet T-Shirt Contest.  But right now, let's intro your brother, Joe.  Here's my brother, Joe.  I'm so proud.  Here he is with his offensive song, I believe. 
[00:20:00]  What are you playing?  I'm doing a song that's dedicated to my three daughters.  Just Boned My Daughter.  Ah, Just Boned My Daughter.  One of the most offensive songs, Joe, if you would please.  Oh, I believe we have a little technical problem, Anthony, that they're looking on. 
[00:20:30]  Um, is it the on-air or live, Opie?  We are live on the radio, Anthony.  I mean, is the problem on-air or?  No, no, no.  They're getting a CD.  They're getting a CD.  Oh.  Well, God forbid we did this before Hennig King back there, Anthony.  Trying to get Joe's music so he could sing, I Just Boned My Daughter.  I believe we're ready to go, Anthony. 
[00:21:00]  Live on the radio.  It's Anthony's brother, Joe.  I believe we're set.  And one of the many most offensive songs that came in in the past three or four months.  Here we go.  Well, where the hell is it?  All right, this is great.  Can we get a girl on stage to blast the crowd?  No, okay, here we go.  They were just panicking, Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  It's all right.  There's always technical.  Never mind.  I'm doing this myself.  Who needs a CD?  Shut the CD off.  Joe will do it himself.  All right, let's go.  Here goes Joe, improvising.  Here goes Joe, improvising.  Here goes Joe, improvising.  My phone gets restless, so I violate my little girl's tender wolf. 
[00:22:00]  She's a young girl, five or six, definitely three pubescent.  While her mother sleeps, I know it's kind of underhanded, kind of lame and foul. 
[00:22:30]  But I stick down and stroke her hair with my tool.  Then pull down her underoos.  Just boned my daughter.  It felt good.  Incest is best.  It felt fine to me.  Just boned my daughter.  It felt good. 
[00:23:00]  Incest is best.  It felt fine to me.  Just boned my daughter.  There she is.  I hold my hand over her mouth.  And I take her from behind. 
[00:23:30]  Just boned my daughter.  It felt good.  Incest is best.  It felt fine to me.  Just boned my daughter.  It felt good.  Incest is best.  It felt fine to me. 
[00:24:00]  Just boned my daughter.  It felt good.  Incest is best.  It felt fine to me.  Just boned my daughter.  It felt good.  It says it's best if you're fine to me, just all night. 
[00:24:30]  Rusty, trusty trombone.  Rusty trombone.  Rusty trombone.  Rusty trombone.  Rusty trombone.  Rusty trombone.  Rusty trombone.  Yeah, let's hear for Joe, Anthony's brother.  Oh my God, you've disgraced the entire family. 
[00:25:00]  Just think of how my daughters feel.  I don't know if the crowd can handle Oh Mine Pure live.  I just don't think we can do it live, Anthony.  Oh Mine Pure.  I think he needs a CD for this one.  So hold on a second is what Rick is telling me.  He's freaking out back there.  Yeah, let's bring up Trish real fast. 
[00:25:30]  Trish, come on up here.  Trish!  Trish is another girl that has appeared on our show on many, many occasions.  You might have seen some of her pictures on the internet on the unofficial Opian Anthony website, foundrymusic.com.  This is Trish, everyone.  There she is.  She's got a wild bikini on, Anthony.  I see that.  And she also has three nipples.  This is the girl with the three nipples, by the way.  And we are taking pictures for the internet.  If you're in your car or at home, just go to www.com. 
[00:26:00]  You'll be able to see a lot of the stuff we're describing on the radio here.  Trish, screw that.  That's what they want to see.  Okay, very good.  There it is.  The third nipple.  What?  What?  What?  You say what over where here?  Huh?  I'm over here now.  Very nice.  What do you guys think of Trish, huh?  Whoa.  Hardwood floor.  Hardwood floor, you're right.  Very good, yes. 
[00:26:30]  Wood floor.  We didn't have to play.  Guess what's in Trish's pants, did we?  All right, Anthony, I think we're going to have to take a break.  They've got to try to figure out what's going on.  We want to get Joe up here to play Oh Mind Fewer.  We're going to take a break?  Yeah, it's very difficult to get one second key player working.  Oh, we're ready.  We're ready.  Come on back up here, Joe.  Get up here, Joe.  If you're listening in your car, we're making this up as we go along once again.  This is truly a sing-along, people.  Joe, for another most offensive song, penned one called, 
[00:27:00]  Oh Mind Fewer.  Anthony, I think we need Trish to kind of just dance to the song on stage.  That would help a lot of festivities.  Trish, get back up here to dance.  Take off your clothes.  I mean, take, you know, that's how I call it.  Take off your clothes.  Take those pants off.  I'm not looking, Colleen.  You're a pussy whip, Joe.  Pussy whip.  Joe is the most pussy whip guy.  I'm friggin' embarrassed.  Come on.  Who else is a pussy whip around here?  Come on.  Read that sign.  All right.  I think we're ready for another song that Joe penned. 
[00:27:30]  This song caused a lot of controversy on our radio show.  Well, what?  I don't know what you mean.  Uh, wow.  Thank you, Trish.  Hey, how you doing, Trish?  We good, Trish.  Very nice.  I think we're ready for an old monitor.  Oh, no.  It's gotta be louder than that.  Start it over.  It was my chicken.
