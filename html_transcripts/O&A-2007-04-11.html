<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, featuring James Norton, began with self-deprecating humor before diving into a heated discussion about the Don Imus controversy and his use of the phrase "nappy-headed hoes."  The hosts, using frequent racial slurs and misogynistic language, argued that the outrage was disproportionate compared to similar language in rap music, framing it as a freedom of speech issue unfairly targeting white radio hosts.  They mocked the Rutgers women's basketball players' reactions,  Al Sharpton, Steve Harvey, and the media's coverage,  accusing them of hypocrisy and racial bias.  They speculated about a double standard, noting the lack of similar criticism for black radio hosts using comparable language.  The conversation included jokes about Long Island women and rednecks, and even a hypothetical "rule book" for acceptable racial slurs.  A caller supported their stance, prompting further discussion about Imus's future and the ongoing media frenzy.  Other news items briefly mentioned included the Anna Nicole Smith paternity case and the Duke lacrosse case.  James Norton's upcoming HBO special was promoted.

The show then played clips of rap songs containing derogatory terms for women, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy in the reaction to Imus. Listeners called in with varying opinions, and the hosts engaged in a humorous, yet offensive, exchange about different terms for women.  A caller suggested Imus's backlash would have been less severe with a different phrase.  The show also replayed a bizarre segment from a previous show featuring Jim Norton and E-Rock engaging in a comedic, butt-touching act, including flatulence.  The upcoming Imus Radiothon was discussed, juxtaposed with the ongoing controversy.  E-Rock and a later mention of David Duchovny were the only named in-studio guests beyond the hosts and Norton.  Whoopi Goldberg and her production company, "One Ho Productions," were also mentioned.

An interview with David Duchovny followed, promoting "The TV Set."  Duchovny discussed the film's satirical look at television production, compromises made by writers, and an *X-Files* episode pulled from rotation due to its incestuous storyline. The interview included a humorous segment involving a staff member, Roland, due to inaccurate information in Duchovny's one-sheet.  *The X-Files* sequel, *Lost*, and David Caruso's career were briefly discussed.  After the interview, the show returned to the Imus controversy, arguing that Imus shouldn't be held to the same standards as newscasters, comparing him to other comedians and entertainers.  Al Roker's overreaction and the hypocrisy surrounding Imus's charitable work were criticized.  Listener calls included discussions of racist terms on a couch label, the hosts' past controversies, and impressions of Don Imus.


A subsequent segment focused on the differing standards of acceptable language for comedians versus news anchors, using Jay Leno and Brian Williams as examples. Whoopi Goldberg's reaction was labelled as "phony outrage."  Jay Moore called in, using highly offensive racial slurs and vehemently defending Imus, engaging in a contentious exchange with the hosts.  Al Sharpton's perceived hypocrisy was again discussed, along with examples of racist statements by black public figures. The conversation included tangents about message boards, Matt Dillon sightings, Snoop Dogg's response, and the differences between acceptable stage speech and broadcast radio. A caller challenged the hosts' criticism of Al Sharpton, which they defended.  Audio clips of Whoopi Goldberg were played, and the discussion included references to Ted Danson's blackface incident, and reactions from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

The final segment heavily focused on the Imus controversy, with callers offering varying perspectives and using offensive language.  Tangents included a humorous discussion of "nappy-headed hoe," speculation on the show's cancellation, and a vulgar anecdote about astronaut Lisa Nowak's arrest and the items found in her car.  Numerous calls contributed to the chaotic atmosphere.  Mention of a planned segment with Kenny was made, but deemed unlikely.  A physical bit involving studio intern Cromwell and Jim Norton, including butt-touching, occurred. The show concluded with plugs for Jim Norton's HBO special and the Opie and Anthony's Las Vegas show, interspersed with further off-color jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What do you know with this?  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  I would apologize.  Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious!  Hilarious, people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Some nappy-headed hoes. 
[00:01:30]  Nappy-headed hoes. Nappy-headed hoes. Nappy-headed hoes. Boner-nosed, beanie-wearing, juke-born. 
[00:02:00]  Race war! Race war!  Yep. It's official. Race war!  Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're a week into white people held hostage.  No kidding. Day seven.  Hey, let's just do announcements today. Ready? 
[00:02:30]  Attention, black people. Please tell us the rules.  Attention, black people. We are the weaker species. We need to know the rules.  Attention, black people. What the hell are the rules?  Yeah, we need, if we're going to be put under this scrutiny, we need a rule book.  Someone in the black community has to put out a rule book for white people.  Stating what we can say and can't say. 
[00:03:00]  Because we can't base it on what you can say and can't say, because apparently it's completely different.  So we just need the rule book. You can say this. We can't.  And that way we can all try to keep our jobs and keep civil and not destroy young lives.  Look, I'm an expert at one thing. Radio?  Yeah.  I'm not going to argue about the black man in America and all that crap, but I'll say this much.  Shame, shame on you to every black radio host in America.  They're making this into a black-white thing instead of a freedom of speech thing. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  You're insane.  You're insane if you don't think this is going to come to bite you in the ass next.  At some point.  At some point.  Right now the ball's in their court, though.  They really have all the juice right now.  This is a freedom of speech issue big time.  Radio has been changing ever since the Janet Jackson incident.  We know that, okay?  And radio pretty much did a really, really good job.  Actually, the culture, actually the political correctness in America has done a really, really good job of getting rid of all of the shock jocks. 
[00:04:00]  The shocking sexual stuff.  Because that was the big thing.  If you're a shock jock and you did this sexual stuff, a lot of women in the studio doing things,  descriptions of graphic sexual acts, that was what the big issue was.  And that's what jocks were getting thrown off the air for.  They even got rid of us.  Yeah.  We're not really shock jocks anymore. 
[00:04:30]  But thank God we had a talent to continue.  There's a lot of shock jocks that really didn't have much talent past the shocking stuff.  And they're gone.  They're gone.  You can list them all.  They're working at gas stations and clothing stores all around America now.  They're out of the business.  But it was all about sex.  If you did something sexually related, that's when you got in trouble.  So they pulled all that from radio.  Right.  Not allowed to do it.  The FCC jumped on it, increased the fines. 
[00:05:00]  And then management at the radio station said, look, we can't afford to have a $350,000 fine now.  So you guys really got to crack down.  So the rules at the radio stations got even worse than the FCC rules.  It went above and beyond what the FCC even said to cut out the sex.  So everyone had to settle down and finally go, OK, so that kind of took hold.  We accepted it because we really had no choice.  And we move on with the show. 
[00:05:30]  And you fast forward to the Don Imus incident.  Now they're going after language.  Language.  And that is what is beyond scary.  This could be our last show today.  I know that's dramatic.  And I'm going to say it every day because we don't know anymore.  Yeah.  We don't know the rules.  We don't know if today's the last show we'll ever do or a year from now.  But it is happening.  They're going to go after us next.  And they're going to go after anyone else that does edgy radio, OK?  Don Imus had a 40-year career in radio.  And I said had because even if he's allowed to continue, he's going to be neutered, OK? 
[00:06:00]  It's not going to be the Don Imus you know and love.  And there's a lot of people that do love the guy.  He's done a lot of good for whatever.  They don't want to hear that, obviously, on the news or anywhere else.  But 40 years with a microphone on almost every day, and he says some dumb, dumb thing, nappy-headed hose.  It's literally two seconds.  Yeah.  And his whole career is completely destroyed.  And that's it.  You take 40 years, and that's it. 
[00:06:30]  I'd like to see one person who never made a slight error in their job in 40 years.  You ever cut a piece of wood too short and have to throw it away?  Yeah.  You know, if you're a carpenter?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You ever make a bad sandwich at a deli?  You ever over-pump gas at the gas station?  Yeah.  You know, you ever over-bill somebody at your company?  Yeah.  If you're working somewhere for 40 years at a certain job, you probably made a few mistakes 
[00:07:00]  in that time.  And to then, what I consider this being a minor mistake also.  I don't consider this.  The way they're writing it, the way they're reporting it, is as if Imus took an hour,  and read verbatim a Hitler speech and meant it.  Yeah.  That's how blown out of proportion this has gotten.  Yeah.  And the guy makes an error after 40 years on the radio like this, and they're calling  for his head.  They just want to chop this guy's head off and use it as an example of an older white guy 
[00:07:30]  that is so representative of everything that black people just disdain.  They just hate the look of him.  He represents all the years of oppression of black people.  So now they got a power base going, and it's snowballing.  Oh, yeah, it is.  This power base, everyone's jumping on board.  Again, a lot of it based on racial lines. 
[00:08:00]  There it is right there.  I mean, it's on every TV right now.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  And they feel this power, and they're running crazy with it.  Everyone wants to jump on it.  Every activist wants to come out and get their name attached to it.  But the way those Rutgers girls were talking yesterday, you could swear something happened  where they were gang raped.  It was as if the worst possible thing had ever happened in their life, the way they were 
[00:08:30]  talking.  The reality is most of America didn't even know Rutgers was playing in the women's basketball  final.  Yeah.  It was shown on ESPN2.  It's women's college basketball.  No one gives a crap about women's college basketball to begin with, okay?  Jesus Christ, let's be real here.  It was quite an accomplishment for people that go to Rutgers, the players, and their  families.  That's pretty much it.  And they weren't even good enough.  Tennessee beat them. 
[00:09:00]  All right?  They didn't even win.  Tennessee beat them.  You know, I did very well at foosball one night, and someone insulted me.  Yeah.  Felt bad.  There you go.  Didn't ruin my life.  You know, it's funny.  Here's one of the rules, by the way, that you were asking about the rules.  Oh, yeah.  What are the rules?  Old white man says something about girls' basketball team.  He's a racist and he should be fired.  Black stripper accuses white college students of raping her, and the racial angle is never  really talked about except when accusing the young man until they finally obviously didn't 
[00:09:30]  do it.  And then the whole racial angle.  And then the racial angle goes away.  Yeah.  The Duke students.  Yeah.  That obviously this was a complete fallacy.  This never happened.  This rape of this black hoe.  That's what she was.  She was a type of prostitute or something.  No, no, no.  She was a whore.  A whore.  Because hoe is kind of endearing in the black community.  Is it?  Yes, it is.  Not if I say it.  Not if you say it.  Hey, if they're throwing around like it's nothing, like it's the word the, then you know 
[00:10:00]  what, it's kind of endearing.  To say whore is much more brutal.  Rappers can say it.  It's the same with the N-word.  One way is okay, the other way is not okay.  Wait, do you mean nappy or the one we can't even think?  Who knows if we're allowed to say.  Oh my God, I thought the N-word.  Who knows?  Don't fire me.  But Jimmy is pointing out, yes, that all charges are being dropped in the Duke Lacrosse  case this morning as well.  And then the racial angle is completely not being talked about because they're showing this 
[00:10:30]  face of these heroines who are disgraced by the old white man.  Yes.  What a phony.  How is the whole country buying into this crap?  How?  Yeah.  Can I make an observation, by the way?  And it's meant in a joking fashion.  I guess you've got to set up everything so people don't think you're throwing hate speech  out there.  Uh-oh.  Oh boy.  Anyone else notice that...  Everyone's severance package together.  Anyone else notice that the women at the press conference yesterday? 
[00:11:00]  Their hair was nowhere near nappy.  No.  That was straight.  Straight hair.  Do you think that was a bit calculated?  They have the straightest hair I've ever seen.  I think every single one of them used about a gallon of conditioner and then they just  were ironing each other's hair all afternoon.  Ironing over and over and over again, making sure it is as straight as humanly possible.  It looks nice.  They got a nice sheen to it.  It looks healthy.  The American American scene and go, wow, he had a point. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And if they didn't...  Yeah, they didn't want to...  Yeah, absolutely.  And if they didn't strain it out, they made sure it was nice and tight, pulled back and  tight.  Corn rows on the one girl over there.  I wonder if they had a little team meeting.  Now, you make sure your hair's not nappy before we go on TV today.  Get to the parlor.  At least...  I have to say one thing for the girls.  At least they weren't melodramatic.  All of our accomplishments were lost.  Our moment was taken away.  We were stripped of this moment by the degrading comments made by Mr. Imus. 
[00:12:00]  And I think that that's at least, you know, kind of balanced with an off-color comment  he made.  You know who took away all that?  The Tennessee women's basketball team.  Yeah, perhaps the Tennessee team took away your big moment when they won.  Oh, wow.  And Jimmy, you read that completely wrong.  Fuck.  It was the...  Actually, the white girl came up and spoke.  And if you saw the speech...  Is that the white girl?  This is what she sounded like. 
[00:12:30]  We had a great moment.  It was taken away by Donna Imus' insensitive remarks.  Wait a minute.  Oh, she droned on and on.  She sounded like some kind of...  And am I going to get in trouble for this?  No, because she's white.  She sounded like just some Jersey chick.  Some Jersey broad?  Some Jersey broad or some Long Island broad.  She had that awful Long Island broad accent.  Oh, no.  We're using the word broad.  Is that okay?  I don't know.  That's sexist. 
[00:13:00]  Hey, I've known a lot of Long Island broads.  And I'll use the word broad.  Well...  There are Long Island girls, Long Island women, Long Island ladies, and Long Island broads.  And you know when you see the broads?  When I go out to those crap hole Long Island bars that I used to hang out at, I saw broads.  And they talk like that.  That's what she sounded like.  Sorry.  And attention to all the black radio hosts out there.  Do not use the word broad.  Yeah.  That's a white thing.  That's a white word. 
[00:13:30]  We're allowed to throw it around among ourselves, but you're not allowed to.  And dame.  We take dame as well.  They're not broads or dames.  They're whole Americans.  We...  We, uh...  I'm claiming dame for the white people.  We lay claim to dame.  And broads.  Broads and chicks.  Chicks have always been a white guy word.  No black people can use.  We're allowed to among ourselves.  How about this?  You're right. 
[00:14:00]  They have...  Black people want words that they can use and we can't.  And that's fair enough.  So you guys can have nigger and nappy and we'll take college and banking.  Well, you want to have a different set of rules?  Yeah, there are.  If you suggested words that only white people could say...  Right.  People would be...  If there was one instance of a black radio host saying something inappropriate, well,  you said that and you're black.  You're not supposed to say that.  You're not allowed.  Why don't we have the freedom?  Why don't we have the freedom to say whatever words we want?  Because that's a white word. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  So only white people can say that word.  Well, where do you come off with that?  Because you've said that there are words that black people can use that white people can't?  Yeah.  Once again...  Oh!  Uh, once again...  Look at that hot chick!  She's a nice-looking broad!  Our words.  That's right.  Don't say broad.  That's ours.  Steve Harvey is a joke in radio, by the way.  In the Daily News, Imus Affair opens deep divide on morning shows, okay? 
[00:15:00]  What a surprise.  The white show hosts agree with Imus.  The black show hosts don't agree with Imus.  That's terrific when it really is a freedom of speech thing in the end.  This is the OJ thing.  Someday you'll realize that it's a freedom of speech thing.  It's the OJ thing all over again as far as being drawn down racial lines.  I mean, of course, you'll get the liberal, guilt-ridden, self-hating white people that'll side with every issue that black people have.  But for the most part, it's divided right down racial lines.  It's, you know, a white guy says something inappropriate, and, you know, black people are against him. 
[00:15:30]  You know, a white woman has her head lopped off by a black guy, and, you know, black people are against her.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me read this really fast.  WFNY morning co-host, Opie Charged, that the Reverend Al Sharpton, who was leading a campaign to get Imus fired, would never criticize rappers who use similar language the way you went after Imus.  It's not the way.  He's criticized.  His whole argument, Reverend Al, is I do criticize.  He says I do criticize rappers, and I'm trying to, you know, clean up the rap language. 
[00:16:00]  But like I said yesterday, he doesn't do it with this verve and gusto that he's going after Imus with.  He calls these things, and we said this yesterday, he calls them a summit, a rap summit, or a meeting, or something.  He'll come up with some word where it isn't a protest, or it's very, it's innocent.  It's a discussion.  This is a witch hunt, and when he goes after rap lyrics, he wants to meet with them under the guise of a summit. 
[00:16:30]  Like there's some kind of big, important meeting going on with him trying to get the rappers to stop using words like ho and things like that.  But when it's Imus, when it's a white person doing something, then they just call for a firing in their head, and that's it.  Why don't they call for the label to drop 50 or drop other people they don't like it?  I've never heard him say that.  Well, no.  Not calling for the, dropping from the label.  Never.  You're a hypocrite.  They do the rap lyrics.  When they go after rappers, they go after them the right way, because they say, we're going to encourage the community to not buy, and that's what you should do. 
[00:17:00]  Encourage people to not support if you don't like it.  You don't scream for somebody to be fired.  Yep.  They want his job taken away, and they're saying that they're still for freedom of speech.  They're phony.  This is, I misrepresent something, and black people can't side with him, or they're going to be seen as far.  And there's another issue about the freedom of speech thing here, because a lot of people are saying freedom of speech, but freedom of speech has consequences.  Not like this.  What he said doesn't deserve the reaction it's getting. 
[00:17:30]  And if you have freedom of speech, but every time you say something, someone punches you in the face, and you say it again, and they punch you in the face, it's not freedom of speech.  If the punishment for saying something is being punched in the face, all of a sudden, it's not freedom of speech anymore, because you're not free to say this without these bizarre repercussions that you're going to get.  If you're losing your job, if that's one of the, what did they say, freedom of speech has its what? 
[00:18:00]  Consequences.  If that's a consequence of freedom of speech, then it's not freedom of speech.  That's a great point.  You're being threatened. You have a threat being held over you.  It's like, yeah, you have the freedom. Say it. Go ahead. Say it. Say it.  Bam! You get hit in the face. No, you're free. Go ahead. Go ahead. Say it. Say it. Bam! You get hit in the face. It's not freedom. You're being threatened. There's a threat over your head.  So Imus would have skayed, you think, if he did it as a rap song?  Yes.  A little rap?  Yeah.  Maybe he had a talking rap?  A little innocent rap song like a parody. If he would have used cactus, Miss Imus. 
[00:18:30]  Let me get into this, because the Steve Harvey thing is just beyond ridiculous.  Steve Harvey's a douche.  White people are completely castrated in this situation, said Opie's partner Anthony, who said Imus' comment was just a joke that didn't work.  It's meaningless, said Anthony. These are just words.  Harvey and Miss Jones couldn't have disagreed more.  Of course.  And this is what infuriates me.  People who think these terms can be used anywhere are wrong, said Harvey, and no one should ever use them without realizing there will be repercussions.  I get that. 
[00:19:00]  Imus uses Nappy Headed Ho, said Mrs. Jones, as his way of saying the N-word.  You're a dummy.  You're a dummy.  How do you make that leap?  Let me see.  They've made more leaps with these words.  They've interpreted what he said into such bizarre, overblown crap.  I'm stunned.  So he basically, she's saying, was using the N-word.  Imus uses Nappy Headed Ho as his way of saying the N-word, Mrs. Jones. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  Sure, Mrs. Jones.  Feeling a little insecure?  Feeling a little insecure about your race, are you?  Maybe she should have been fired.  Did you read the rest of what, if this doesn't make you want to throw up?  The Harvey thing?  Right?  Going back to the, a little bit down a little bit more.  Harvey says it's not the action of blacks.  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm getting at.  Let me read this.  Harvey said it's not the action of blacks that needs attention.  If black, this is what is insane in America, the United States of America.  And this is where the real problem is. 
[00:20:00]  And they really, yes, and I mean black people.  They really mean this.  Yeah.  If black people want to talk about each other a certain way, that's their option, he said.  Mr. Imus, you don't have that option.  You can't say what I say.  And in America!  Oh, so that's a freedom of speech issue.  Boy, you are really just a guardian of freedom of speech, aren't you, you dummy?  You dummy.  We've been arguing that point for well over a year now.  If a black person is allowed to say something, then a white person is allowed to say the exact same thing in America. 
[00:20:30]  What's with the separatism?  Black people are the most separatist people in this country.  They are the most separatist people in this country.  And I'm not saying all, okay?  But believe me, there's a lot.  And the ones that are outspoken are the most separatist.  Steve Harvey is being a separatist by saying that.  Saying that black people should be able to do something that white people shouldn't be able to do.  That's separatist. 
[00:21:00]  How the hell is that going to make things better by announcing that only black people could talk a certain way?  We're doomed.  And a white person tries the same thing, that that's no good.  That's insane.  Doomed as a nation.  That's insane.  Blacks and whites will never, ever, ever be able to see eye to eye and work together for the best of this country because of things like this.  Because of the separatism that goes on.  Jumping on Imus for his dopey comment. 
[00:21:30]  And then magnifying it 800 times over.  And to finish up with Steve Harvey, we played one of his bits, I think, two weeks ago, where he has a whole redneck bit.  Yeah.  What's the difference?  That's okay.  You're right.  Redneck news.  That's okay.  Maybe only white people should talk about rednecks.  Yep.  Redneck news?  How about people that live down south?  He was putting on this southern accent.  What about people that live down south that have that accent?  That aren't blithering idiots like that were portrayed on his program.  You know why we're not jumping up and down and screaming? 
[00:22:00]  Because we're secure with our race.  Are you?  Are you?  We don't give a crap if you talk about whitey.  Being white rules.  You're right, though.  We don't care if you talk about white.  We don't care.  And that seems to be the problem.  Because we never, whenever anything happens, we never jump up and complain and protest and call for firings and this, that.  And if we do, it's spun around into some kind of, like when that black guy punched the old lady in the head. 
[00:22:30]  Punched her in the face and robbed her.  Which case?  You mean the one that happened to be caught on film?  Yeah, the one that happened to be caught on film.  With her little pillbox hat.  That little pillbox hat went flying.  Leon Stinks.  He couldn't knock her down.  Leon Stinks.  He couldn't knock her down.  When that happened, white people were looking and saying, it's a racial thing.  It's a black guy hitting an old white woman.  But it'll be spun around like, no, it's crime. 
[00:23:00]  It's just crime.  It happens.  There's no racial thing here involved at all.  If it was the other way around, it would be a hate crime.  If there was some young white guy that punched a black woman in the face in her apartment building and robbed her, it would be a hate crime.  There would be marches.  Reverend Al would come out.  It would be a big thing.  White people never see it like that or take the initiative to protest or call things out as race crimes when sometimes they clearly are. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  Let's – we've got to take a break.  We're obviously just getting started, and this is going to be our focus once again today.  But we will try to get into other things as well.  But just to wrap up, so this is the radio column in the New York paper today.  It's all about Imus.  And if this is not telling, I'm reading all this black and white.  The white show hosts don't think Imus should get fired.  The black show hosts think absolutely he should get fired.  And then at the end of the article, David Hinckley, like, mops up and talks about a couple other things that are happening in the radio world in New York City. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And he writes this.  And if this isn't telling – because this is what radio will become, more of this.  It's not going to be interesting in any shape or form.  The Scott and Todd Morning Show at WPLJ has locked a group of listeners into a prison at Menlo Park Mall this week.  The winner not only gets out, but gets $5,000 in a trip to Aruba. 
[00:24:30]  And then he ends it by saying, okay, everybody else gets out too.  Oh, well, that's good.  That would be sad if someone's in Aruba resting on a beach and the other ones are having gay sex with each other and rotting away in prison.  Doing 25 to life.  See, we didn't tell you that.  You got to stay in prison if you –  That's the type of radio.  That's what you're going to get eventually.  Scott and Todd prison.  They don't rape you.  They just make you listen to that show over and over again.  Which is worse.  All right.  Oh, and by the way, before we go to break, if you're thinking about apologizing about anything you've done, just don't do it. 
[00:25:00]  Apologies in the year 2007 don't mean crap.  Gets you in more trouble.  It keeps the –  Don't mean crap.  Keeps it in the news.  Keeps the snowball rolling downhill.  What you got to do is just lock yourself in your house and disappear for a while.  You give one apology quickly and leave.  Doing what Imus did, trying to reach out and talk to people, has only made matters worse for the guy. 
[00:25:30]  It's a shame.  So don't apologize.  Go on a blaze of glory.  I truly believe he means it, too, with his apology.  He does.  He does want to make his show better and different.  He was sitting that way for many years anyway.  The shock jock thing was just a very, very tiny piece of what Imus has been doing the last, who knows, at least five or six years, if not longer.  Can you name one time in your recent memory when white people have protested anything a black person is doing or done? 
[00:26:00]  No, because the second you do, you're considered a white supremacist or something.  The second you call out anybody of color, you're a white supremacist.  They label you as a racist.  It just, it's not worth the trouble.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Phone's lit.  Like I said, if you're black, maybe you can help us with the rules.  Tell us the rules.  Yeah, we need a rule book.  Tell us the rules. 
[00:26:30]  Our phone number, we don't really have to give it out, but maybe for later.  1-866-313-FREE.  Free.  Free nothing.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out, well, Dave.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Ready?  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip them out, Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:27:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  Thanks for your support.  Big hi to all our fans and listeners.  One of these days, you're going to tune in.  We're not going to be here. 
[00:27:30]  I guarantee that.  And speaking of which, I'm going to make another guarantee.  By the end of the week, Imus will be taking off MSNBC for good.  You think?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  He's going to do a two-week suspension starting Monday.  But I say, before Friday, MSNBC cancels the TV version of the show.  It's obviously a simulcast of his radio show.  Mark my words on that one.  Well, you know, the black community is very wounded over what he said.  They can't get over that somebody would say something so horrible. 
[00:28:00]  By the way, just to bring everyone up to speed, you're just waking up.  Here's the latest on Mr. Imus.  And I want to stress once again, this is a freedom of speech thing.  You should be able to say whatever the hell you want on the radio.  Within FCC regulations.  And there shouldn't be any consequences.  No, you can't offend people, man.  It's against the law to offend people.  In the United States of America, there should not be any consequences for saying stuff on a radio show.  No.  A dopey radio show, by the way. 
[00:28:30]  This isn't NPR.  It's not.  Imus was based on, his show was based on comedy.  Ours certainly is based on comedy.  You should be able to say whatever the hell you want.  Yeah, get a comic up on stage.  You can say whatever they want.  Ah, they'll go after comedy clubs next.  You watch.  You watch.  Anthony taught me this years ago.  You know, they take a little bit and you're like, ah, it's okay.  Because people are offended by that word.  That's just one thing.  And then they go after another word.  Then they go after another group.  And that's why the black radio show hosts have got to wake up. 
[00:29:00]  No one stops.  See?  The N-word was the big thing everyone was talking about.  And that got eliminated to the point where now everyone just has to say N-word.  We can't say it on the air.  You can't say it there.  It's just, it's gotten ridiculous.  And that kind of was, you know, that kind of blew over.  And now, what, everything went away?  We can do whatever we want?  No.  Now it's nappy, ho.  I don't know.  What context are you even allowed to use it in?  I get a little shaky now whenever I say it. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  It's like, you know, the newscasters are saying it.  They're describing what Imus said.  Nappy head, nappy head at ho.  Ah, we did the montage for everybody.  But, you know, can you say it in any context?  I think if you're singing in rap lyrics, you're okay.  Then you're okay?  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, here's the latest on Imus just to get everyone up to speed.  Well, several more protests are planned today against radio talk show host Don Imus.  Rallies will take place at New York City Hall, Rutgers University, and in Newark. 
[00:30:00]  Sponsors, including Croster & Gamble, Staples, and Bigelow Tea have pulled ads from Imus' MSNBC show over the racially charged comments he made about the Rutgers women's basketball team.  The players say that they'll meet with the shock jock despite his, quote, deplorable remarks.  We are highly angered at his remarks, but deeply saddened with the racial characterization they entail.  Imus has apologized and been suspended for two weeks, but many groups are calling for his resignation. 
[00:30:30]  Of course they are.  Resignation after 40 years of broadcasting.  Well, no, it's again, if you're a white guy and you say something like that, black people are going to pretend that they're really wounded, and they're not.  And they're being phony about it because he's an old white guy and he represents something, and that's all it is.  And if they were really wounded, they'd have to rap with the same fervor, and all they do is grovel and say, look, that's not really nice that you say that.  Let's have a summit.  They don't have a hip-hop summit.  I have a feeling that the women's basketball team, by the way, was pulled aside into maybe a little office or something, and they were told why they should be offended by this. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, here's why you're upset.  First of all, none of them heard Imus' show.  They were a little out of Imus' demo.  I don't think they heard his show.  So if they didn't hear it, what's the problem?  And then, well, people had to tell them and then tell them how horrible it was and ruin their moment.  Like you were saying, that Tennessee ruined your moment.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  A to the H from Columbus, Ohio. 
[00:31:30]  Political correctness is going to be the death of America.  Yeah, this version of America blows.  It really does blow.  I like this version.  It's the same as it was in the 60s, all language-wise, obviously.  We need 2.0.  It's just, like, you know, one long time white people could say whatever they wanted, black people couldn't say anything, and now it's kind of swung in where it's not that severe,  but it's like a little bit like, well, black people can say this, but white people can't.  There's nothing we can say that they can't.  This is like America Vista.  I don't like it.  It doesn't load.  It keeps crashing. 
[00:32:00]  By the way, maybe someone could explain this, but in the top Yahoo searches, we're in ninth place.  Ooh.  Like, they're searching out our name more than Imus in Yahoo for some reason.  Shock Joe.  Because of shock jockery.  I don't know where that came from, but we're in ninth place as far as Yahoo searches go today.  Moving up the charts.  And I got a Google alert, and there's a huge AP story that hit the wire.  It's in about 100 newspapers today.  Mm-hmm.  It's gone everywhere.  And the headline is, Morning Radio, a recipe for disaster. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, can I have some stings in or what?  Oh, jeez.  I had this up all day.  But thank God it's on here.  Don't worry.  We'll be using that shortly.  Got to keep that handy.  Because, God forbid, you say.  Even though rap artists can say it, we can't say it.  Can't say what?  Even watch.  Watch.  I can't say it with the R.  Watch.  See?  Or now here it is without the R, which is the A. 
[00:33:00]  See?  Yeah, see.  I can't say it either way.  Sometimes you got to get it off your chest, please.  Will you stop complaining already, you?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  A lot of drama, though.  Yes.  Thank God the PalTalk mics are on.  They know that there was nothing under the beep.  Because that'll be the next thing.  You got to explain everything now.  I was listening to Opie and Anthony, and they were saying the word.  Oh, I know they were.  All right.  Are you ready?  See, watch. 
[00:33:30]  I can talk over the beep.  There you go.  See, that's the whole joke of the whole thing, isn't it?  So everybody calm down.  I mean.  AP.  So it's got to be true.  Morning Radio, a recipe for disaster.  And, of course, it's all about Imus, but not this article.  It starts off five years ago.  Opie and Anthony were.  We're booted from the nation. 
[00:34:00]  Wow, this is some scary stuff.  Airways, we're somewhere.  A couple had sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  On Tuesday morning.  The shock jocks were back on the air riffing on Don Imus.  I mean, this article makes it sound like we got kicked off five years ago.  Yeah.  And Tuesday morning, we were let back on the air.  We just came back Tuesday. 
[00:34:30]  Just in time to riff on Don Imus.  Hey, we're back.  Hey, how about Don Imus?  The media just stinks overall.  Listen to this line again.  On Tuesday morning, the shock jocks were back on the air riffing on Don Imus.  Yeah.  So we were, like, in jail for five years.  We're like, oh, you got to let them out.  They're going to have something good to say about this.  They've got to talk about Imus.  Put them back on the air.  Yeah.  Not like we haven't been back for three years or so.  Oh, no kidding.  And eventually, just back to the satellite.  That's obvious.  Oh, boy.  Our pictures are in satellite full time.  We'll have to see. 
[00:35:00]  Sorry, CBS, but I think you know that, too.  You know how this is going to end.  Once they draw sight on us.  The latest collision of outrageous radio and outraged listeners is business as usual for  morning radio, where jocks walk in the line between bad taste and big ratings continually  reinvent the art of self-destruction.  The question is not how far can we go, said Michael Harrison, publisher of the trade magazine  Talkers.  It's always been go as far as we can go, and then you start testing the line again.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  It goes on and on, but we're mentioning it, and then later on the article, it says it just  lists everyone that has just effed up in radio, and we're under the category Multiple Offenders.  Multiple Offenders.  Multiple Offenders.  Greg Opie Hughes.  They want to feel like they got something on me.  They know my real name.  Oh, wow.  Gotcha.  And Anthony Cumia. 
[00:36:00]  Were tossed off WNEW in 2002 after the infamous St. Patrick's Cathedral stunt.  Dramatic pause.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know what you were doing there.  They were fired four years earlier in Massachusetts for a misguided April Fool's joke where they  announced Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino was killed in a car crash.  That doesn't really work. 
[00:36:30]  That doesn't really work.  I love that one.  I know.  It's stupid.  Oops.  Scandinavian Americans aren't angered by that.  It's good reading.  It's Scandinavia.  Who yodels?  I don't know.  Who yodels?  I don't know who yodels.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It sounds like when I'm waiting on the line for the Meadowhorn bobsled at Disney.  By the way, to the black radio show host, that's a white thing.  You're not allowed to yodel.  No yodeling.  We'll be paying attention. 
[00:37:00]  We're yodeling Americans.  Also known as douchebags.  That's right.  You're not allowed to do redneck humor.  We're going to keep track now.  No redneck humor by the black radio show host.  You can't yodel.  And don't forget, you can't call our girls broads, chicks, or dames.  Or dames.  And no hockey.  Hmm.  Well, yeah.  Can't even watch it.  And then, this is good reading if you want to check it out for yourself. 
[00:37:30]  Just throw us in the old Google search under news.  It ends with, on their show Tuesday morning, which airs on both satellite and terrestrial radio,  Opie and Anthony were offering their support for Imus, but also joking about taking over his slot  should the veteran broadcaster get the axe.  Unless, of course, the pair gets fired first.  Ha ha ha.  Get it.  Get it.  Yeah, well.  We're fired.  We came back just in time for this.  Let's go to Jimmy in New York.  Jimmy.  Hi, Opie.  I'm...  Yes.  I'm right here. 
[00:38:00]  You have to be so official.  You put me on the spot.  I get nervous.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy.  I'm talking to you.  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  How we doing?  Good.  Good.  Fellas, I just want to call and take my hat off to you guys and salute you guys for what  you're doing and what you're saying.  It's about time somebody stood up and said what everybody's thinking and feeling.  The administrative staff at Rutgers University should be embarrassed.  They should be fired.  Jesus.  Why should they be fired?  Yes, they should be.  Why not?  If I should be fired over a dumb throwaway line that didn't even get that much of a laugh 
[00:38:30]  even though he was going for a laugh, then yes, everyone else should get fired.  That's associated with this.  You couldn't put on a, you couldn't change a channel yesterday without seeing all them  basketball players and the athletic director on TV begging for sympathy.  They should all be ashamed.  You guys are great.  I take my hat off and salute you guys.  I think Anthony brought this up earlier.  I really, I was watching all the coverage, but I was confused for just a split second.  I saw the women up there talking. 
[00:39:00]  I'm like, what horrific thing happened to these women?  Yeah.  Is this another Duke lacrosse thing happening?  They were talking about how one girl gets up there and talks about how this will scar her  for life and it's like you're, you're, you're, you're in college.  Just shut up.  Just shut up.  Because you know something, once you get out of college and really get into, you know,  real life, there'll be plenty of other things that'll scar you. 
[00:39:30]  Believe me.  And not only racism, by the way.  Yeah.  I'm not even talking about racism.  I'm talking about life in general.  Go out, get a job, work for someone that kicks you around for a while.  That's right.  Take some crap at the office.  Life has a way of beating the crap out of you.  Have your boss come up and tell you to go get him a cup of coffee.  But I was on Rutgers Women's Best.  I don't care.  What about my dignity?  I don't care.  Cream and sugar, toots. 
[00:40:00]  And toots is another one that's ours.  We want toots.  All right.  What do we want?  Because these same broad chicks and toots.  Yeah.  All white words.  And hullabaloo.  I don't want hullabaloo.  Hullabaloo is ours.  Leave hullabaloo to the Jews.  Mom.  Please.  No hullabaloo.  Boner-nosed, beanie-wearing Jew boy. 
[00:40:30]  Did I ever really say that?  Yeah.  Wow.  You know what's great?  I can't get enough of this because I see humor in a lot of this as well.  Oh, please.  And all these talking heads on TV, what do you want to call them?  They're useless in general.  But they're all like...  Oh, not yet.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  They're all reciting.  They're all like reciting some of the other stuff that Imus has said.  Yeah.  And then they're getting like experts to talk about the situation. 
[00:41:00]  They're all admitting, well, one time he called me.  And then it's something just like this.  Boner-nosed, beanie-wearing Jew boy.  And I'm just sitting there at home laughing.  We got to get a montage of some of those things that have been said in the last couple days.  Yeah, he once called me, and I don't have an example, but it was just some funny...  Do we have a problem that we are...  Like, our humor is...  We find a lot of things funny.  Like, is that the majority of the country, though? 
[00:41:30]  I know a lot of people I hung out with and grew up with over the years share the same sense of humor I do.  And I've met a lot of people over the years that share the same kind of sense of humor.  You find some sick, dark things funny.  You find odd situations that some people wouldn't find funny.  You find that funny.  And then there's the opposite end of the spectrum, which are these talking heads that I can't see having a sense of humor.  When that one girl from Rutgers gets up and goes, 
[00:42:00]  You don't know these people.  You commented on them and don't even know them.  And then she mentioned one of the girls and said,  You don't know that...  Whatever her name was.  Is one of the funniest people you'll ever meet.  Really?  I bet that's some sense of humor she has.  Why do we need to know that?  I just didn't call out anyone by name.  They actually made a point of saying that you don't know these people personally.  It would be worse if he knew them personally and called them out as separate individuals. 
[00:42:30]  He was talking about a team that lost the championship.  A collective.  Yeah, they're losers.  In the end, they're losers.  They lost the big game.  In the end, they're losers.  I played sports my whole life.  You barely get a pat on the fanny after you lose in a championship game.  You're a loser.  They try to make it sound like,  Oh, what a great year we had.  What a great season.  And I misruined it. 
[00:43:00]  No, it was ruined when that buzzer went off at the end of the fourth.  You know, in another few months,  people won't even remember who lost in the Super Bowl this past year.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  That's how it works.  And it's women's college basketball.  Stop.  EFPN 2.  I thought it was on the Ocho.  Well, dodgeball joke.  Oh, I don't know what it was.  It was a funny broadcast on the Ocho, ESPN 8.  It's actually, women's college basketball is very popular. 
[00:43:30]  I don't want to see this degraded.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  You watch it.  I know.  It was recently voted more popular than quadriplegic volley.  No one cares about this dumb sport.  Oh, now the quadriplegics are going to come rolling after you.  Yeah, but they can't let her right.  So, all these players are hoping to play in the...  I am angry.  Please do not say that, Jim.  We are infuriated.  Now, I will voice my anger. 
[00:44:00]  I am angry.  So very angry.  Honey, I love you.  I love our family.  Now let me switch gears.  Oh, boy, am I angry.  I am so angry.  We walk outside for the walkover, and there will be a bunch of people just sticking their tongues out at us.  Is it true most of these women are hoping to play in the WNBA? 
[00:44:30]  Ah, yes, yes.  Why was jokes?  In character.  It looks like an astronaut photo.  Yeah, it does.  There's five of them all wearing, like, orange.  It looks like orange or red, and that's the look.  They're all looking the same, but that's the way astronauts are photo when they come back from space.  Yes, or like war heroes, you know.  They're just like war heroes.  I have one of the worst jokes possible, and I'm afraid to say it.  I'm not going to say it.  Can we try it off air?  But it's great.  Oh, off air, you'll hear it.  Into it?  It had to do with your statement you just said. 
[00:45:00]  Astronauts?  Yeah, they look like astronauts.  That's all I'm going to say.  All right, we got it.  Okay, turn the mics off.  Turn the mics off.  Well, what are we going to do?  No, two seconds.  Two seconds.  Oh, boy.  Two seconds.  What?  This is very unorthodox.  Two seconds.  I got to say it.  Oh, okay, hold on.  To Jimmy.  Hold on, hold on.  And really turn them off.  Oh, is that a bad one? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, that's a doozy.  Doozy.  That was a loo-loo.  That's a CNN headline.  That happened.  All right.  Hey, we got it.  We got it.  I think someone's got it, by the way.  Maybe they heard us on Pal Talk.  I don't know.  We got the top ten rap songs in America.  And the word ho is in almost every song. 
[00:46:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we want to read some of these rap lyrics today to show the fine standard that is taking place.  Yeah.  And good old Al said he's going to dump out of us reading rap lyrics that have the N-word.  Have that N-word.  Not nappy, the other one.  This is the atmosphere we're living in.  Mm-hmm.  So maybe we could, like, replace the N-word with the word ow.  Ow.  And owls. 
[00:46:30]  Maybe we'll try that, okay?  And we'll get into some other news.  We also have a letter from Esther today.  Esther wrote one of my new favorite segments.  She's a psychopath.  She actually writes letters, real letters, with a pen and paper and stamps.  And when I notice about this letter, she is such a psycho that not only does she lick the envelope, she has to tape it shut, too.  Yeah.  That's like one of those people that want to make sure everything's secure.  Yeah, make sure none of the goodness escapes the envelope.  Yep.  So we'll read a letter from Esther as well and tell you what else is going on in the world. 
[00:47:00]  And, of course, your phone, you know, the phones are lit, so we'll see what you guys are talking about today as well.  Mm-hmm.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got wowed.  We tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:47:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show?  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Let's not forget it's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday, by the way.  Oh.  The girls are wowing like crazy on the Pal Talk cameras.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  And we got our women out there.  They're looking for the wow stickers on the back of the cars and the trucks.  And they will flash you if they see the wow on the back of your truck or car.  Just got a Pal Talk wow.  We have official wow bumper stickers.  Some of the radio stations are handing those out and others aren't. 
[00:48:00]  But that shouldn't stop you.  Maybe you can get a homemade wow sign on the back of your car or truck.  It stands for Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Basically, Whip-A-Mouth Whenever.  You got to be in it to win it.  Get wow sticker on your car.  And you'll see some boobies on the way to work, hopefully.  And if that does happen to you, please don't follow the ladies or harass them.  No, you're just lucky.  Feel good about yourself and drive home.  For the most part, they do not want to have sex with you.  No.  They do not want to have sex with you. 
[00:48:30]  What else is America talking about?  I mean, the Amish thing is just everywhere.  We'll get back into it in a second here.  But some other breaking news.  Larry Burkhead is the father of Anna Nicole Smith's baby.  This is that photographer guy.  What a surprise.  What is he?  A lot of people thought it was Jay Moore.  Really?  Kind of had that Jay Moore look.  Yeah.  Wow, Jay Moore had sex with Anna Nicole Smith?  What a...  Oh, there he is.  There he is.  Like, where did this guy come from, though?  Like, I didn't even know this guy was in the mix. 
[00:49:00]  Photographer slash boyfriend.  You know.  Yeah.  They went out off and on for a while.  And, you know, he did his thing.  What a leech that Howard K. Stern guy is.  Absolutely.  The lawyer.  Because he just seems like a guy that wanted to be...  He's like the guy in the 80s movie that wants that chick and didn't get her.  And, like, the other guy, the jock, got her.  Yeah.  Ducky.  Ducky.  He's ducky.  He's ducky.  He was hoping the baby would be his, but he knew deep down it couldn't be because he 
[00:49:30]  never had sex with her.  They knew from day one the baby looked exactly...  Looked more like Larry Burkhead than Anna Nicole Smith.  So that finally is over.  Burkhead.  He walked out of the courtroom yesterday and said, I told you so.  Yeah.  All dramatically.  And there you go.  So that story has an ending finally.  And Howard K. Stern's not going to fight it.  I'm sure he got some money behind the scenes for this whole thing.  I'm assuming.  And then the other breaking story today. 
[00:50:00]  Do you want audio from the Larry Burkhead?  Does it matter today?  I don't think so.  All right.  Goodbye.  And then the Duke rape case.  Yes.  All charges have been dropped.  Finally, huh?  Yeah.  Jeez.  All charges have been dropped.  Are these students going to be filing some kind of charges against the prosecution here?  Boy, I hope so.  They should.  You want to talk about lives being ruined?  Man.  That one's a little more serious than a dopey shock jock saying something stupid. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, you're going to have this stigma on you now the rest of your life.  You want to talk about lives possibly being ruined?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, even though the charges have dropped, you know, you were one of the Duke rape suspects?  Oh, here.  We'd love to have you work at our company.  Yeah.  All right.  And, Jimmy, you got some news, right?  You need the help of the fans?  Yeah.  People have been asking me for a while.  The HBO special I'm shooting, it's a one-hour special.  And the reason I cancel the improv in D.C. is I'm shooting it in Washington, D.C. 
[00:51:00]  It's June 2nd, Saturday, June 2nd.  There's going to be two shows, and all you have to do, they're free tickets.  HBO doesn't charge for free.  It's JimNorton at BroadwayVideo.com.  Just say your name, email, address, and which show you want to attend, early or late, and  a couple of tickets.  You have to just give that information and your address.  And you're in.  Yes.  So it's Saturday, June 2nd, JimNorton at BroadwayVideo.com.  The Lincoln Theater, Washington, D.C.  I'm shooting my one-hour HBO special.  That is really cool.  Yes, I'm very psyched.  I like that Lincoln Theater, D.C. shooting. 
[00:51:30]  That's nice.  That's good.  Yeah, let's say hi to Ron in Jersey.  Ron, what's up?  Yeah, how are you doing today?  Hey, Ron.  You guys are great Americans.  Thank you, sir.  I had a funny story.  Yesterday, I turned on WBLS, Wendy Williams, and they were talking about the thing which  there was a black guy in there who was agreeing with you guys and saying if we're  allowed to say it, then white people should be allowed to say it.  Absolutely.  In America, that should be the case.  Wait, Wendy, was that her sidekick?  Yeah.  Okay, Charlemagne, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  And they were both kind of agreeing with you guys, but some old lady called up and said,  my husband listens to this K-Rock show, and it was on the radio yesterday, and she says,  and there was Imus who was on this show, and he was laughing and joking about the whole  thing.  What a dope.  And Wendy Williams is like, oh, really?  Really?  I didn't know that.  We'll have to get the tape of that.  I didn't realize that.  Yeah, I got the tape of Imus.  She goes, and they were talking in this piggy Latin. 
[00:52:30]  Pig Latin.  Oh, that's really funny.  Ix ne on the appy ne.  I love you guys, bro.  You guys are great.  Hey, but Wendy Williams was really agreeing with us and doesn't think Imus should be fired  over this?  Yes.  See, she's smart.  If this is true, she's smart.  She realizes it's not a black-white thing.  Well, it is to a point, I guess, but more importantly, it's a freedom of speech thing.  Yeah.  She's smart enough to realize that.  It was just like a slightly inappropriate racial joke with no hate behind it, just being 
[00:53:00]  a ball buster.  That's all.  Everybody kind of knows that.  Yeah, that's perfect.  Slightly inappropriate racial humor with no hate behind it.  One.  There you go.  That's exactly what it was.  And it's being portrayed as this awful, horrible thing that's ruining young women's lives.  Black rappers talk about hoes.  It's all they talk about is women are hoes.  Yeah, hoes.  And it's just weird how black people get mad at that, but they will never demand to hurt  the financial angle of rap. 
[00:53:30]  No.  They would never say, we want them dropped from this label and we're going to protest  and we're not going to buy any CDs or albums from this company until you drop so-and-so.  They would never do it.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Manhattan.  Anthony, what's up?  Hi.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, Anthony.  I heard you mention earlier that there's going to be some kind of protest in Newark today.  Yeah, they're going to protest Newark today, yes.  And I said to myself, isn't that the same city where there's a black-on-black crime, like  the highest in the nation?  Shouldn't there be like a protest behind that? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  How ironic that they would take this protest to Newark, where black-on-black crime is running  rampant.  Young black men being killed at record rates in Newark.  That's why even the mayor and the governor can't control it, not even the cops.  I mean, there's a murder.  There's like already 40 murders and it's not even the end of April yet.  Yeah, for the rest of America, Newark is one of the scariest cities out there.  Oh, it's frightening.  It's right up there.  And it's not only, this was a funny little footnote with Newark. 
[00:54:30]  There was a billboard put up in Newark recently that showed the murder rate.  And instead of addressing the fact that there's a high murder rate in Newark, the various politicians  were upset with the billboard.  Can I say one quick comment?  How ridiculous is that?  Yes, Anthony, go ahead.  Several years ago, I've seen you all hosted the American Music Awards.  And I think on stage it was the Nelson Twins. 
[00:55:00]  They were performing a song.  And right after they finished performing a song, a senior host said, man, those are the  two widest guys I've ever seen.  And I said, well, the white guy that said that about two black guys, I'm sure that person  would have been apologizing.  Absolutely.  Yeah, imagine saying that.  Those are two of the blackest guys I've ever seen.  A beep off the air.  Yeah.  All right.  Great show, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  I was watching Fox, too.  You know, this is my stupid thing.  We could have tried to get Roy Ennis or Niger Ennis on from court.  No, those guys are pretty, they're fairly conservative guys. 
[00:55:30]  I'll bet you that they're not screaming to have Ima's fight.  Yeah.  I guarantee them to have Ima's fight.  Let's string through these calls as fast as possible.  Let's do a speed round.  Dave, black guy, Boston, go.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I found it humorous that Ima said that morning.  But, you know, I think if he had, like, a black cast, maybe a few black people on his  show, you know, maybe he wouldn't have been exposed like he was.  I don't know.  I found it humorous, you know.  And the thing is, you know, it's just black people are sensitive nowadays. 
[00:56:00]  Some black people.  I was raised, you know, sticks and stones may break my bones, but names would never hurt  me.  You know, and my mom always told me a person that responds to the M word is an ignorant  person.  So, you know, I found it humorous.  And I think the workers' program, they just do because they lost the championship, you  know?  That's probably, I'm sure, that's part of it.  There you go.  Thank you, Dave.  Let's go to Ethan in New Hampshire. 
[00:56:30]  Ethan, go ahead.  Yeah, one of my favorite quotes, I don't agree with what you say, but I'll defend your  right to say it.  You know, there's no law that says you have to be a nice, pleasant person.  A person has a right to be a jerk if they want to.  Well, you would think, but not in these times.  Well, their argument with the free speech is probably like, well, we're not putting him in  jail.  We're not saying he legally doesn't have the right.  We're only saying that we're fighting the advertisers.  Yeah, but when you're...  Bottom line is they're removing his livelihood.  When you're threatening somebody's livelihood, that is not freedom of speech.  When the consequences of your speech, and it's not like he was inciting a riot. 
[00:57:00]  He wasn't doing anything where freedom of speech doesn't cover it.  He was speaking, like Jimmy said, making an off-color remark in humor.  That doesn't deserve to lose your livelihood over it.  They're practicing mob tactics and infringing on the freedom of speech.  Let's look at this clip over here.  There you go. 
[00:57:30]  Just another convenience store camera with some guy running in and grabbing merchandise  and running out as an Asian chases him out the door.  Just take a guess what culture the perpetrator was from.  Why do they have to keep showing the same video?  It's not the same video, I think.  See, those are all different convenience store cameras.  Oh, where's the outrage?  Where is the outrage?  Where is the outrage on that?  By the way, as far as this issue goes, the government will stay completely out of it. 
[00:58:00]  It's more about the advertisers and the pressure they wield.  I can't stand when the advertisers pull out like that because they empower people that are trying to take away people's freedom of speech.  You should just turn around and say, no, we're not going to pull our advertising.  What are you going to do about it?  We feel confident enough in the 40 years of radio that Mr. Imus has done and all the fun stuff he's done with his radio show 
[00:58:30]  that we see that this was a slip-up and an apology is good enough for us.  Let's say hi to Ronald in Detroit.  Ronald, what's up?  It's Ronaldo.  Hey, what's up?  All right, Ronaldo.  Yes, this is all just goofy, man.  I mean, maybe it's probably the way he said it.  He's trying to make a joke, Mr. Imus, and people just get it out of hand.  Maybe if he'd have said chicken head hoes, maybe it would have been a little bit better.  Is that a common one, chicken head hoes? 
[00:59:00]  Chicken head.  His pigeon head.  We started the show by saying black people tell us the rules, so that would have been okay?  I don't know.  There's no rules, man.  I mean, I guess it's all on your approach or how you say things or word things.  And right now, this country's in a state of mind.  It's too doggone cookie fat to let people go ahead and do their thing in a proper manner.  He didn't say it with any hate in his voice.  There wasn't – you know he wasn't trying to incite or – he enticed me. 
[00:59:30]  He wasn't trying to start anything racial.  It really was delivered the way he delivers something with humor as a joke.  The guy wasn't trying to hurt people.  It's just ridiculous how carried away this thing is getting.  Yeah, I've seen those chicks, dude.  Excuse me for cutting you off.  I've seen those chicks on the –  Watch the – well, excuse me, sir. 
[01:00:00]  Chicks.  Excuse me.  Chicks.  We're fighting over the word chicks.  Yeah, white people want the word chicks.  We want that one.  You're not allowed to say that.  So use a black word, sir.  I'm sorry.  Like gals.  Black word like gals.  Gals.  Yeah, we want gals.  We want gals, dames, broads.  Chicks.  Chicks.  And someone suggested we want fillies, too.  Fillies?  Well, we're on in Philadelphia, so what the hell.  Fillies, shorties, home.  Shorties.  No, you guys got shorties.  You guys got shorties.  Whatever you want to call them. 
[01:00:30]  Hood rats.  What is hood rats?  We're going to just divide up all the words, and then everyone will be satisfied out there.  I have a question about shorties.  All right, shorties.  I have to ask a black guy a question about shorties, because my friends will call women like,  hey, shorty.  And I actually like when a black guy calls a chick that I'm like, that is probably the coolest  way I've ever heard a girl addressed, a black guy will say to a chick, hey, shorty.  Yeah.  Then my friend, like, Sherrod Small will look at me and go, what's up, shorty?  Oh, Jesus.  That's not good.  No, no, no.  It's not like he rapes me.  It's just like, they will use that for, like, guys and girls, right? 
[01:01:00]  No.  Just you and girls.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Hey, shorty.  I've been called shorty before.  Maybe he's using it in the literal term.  Okay, because I'm a little tough.  He thinks you're short.  All right.  All right, Detroit.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jen.  Shorty.  Because you're hairless.  Jen's from Hempstead.  She's black.  Jen, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Love you, love you.  You could have just said she's from Hempstead.  Yeah, we would have been able to tell the black part.  You know you're from Long Island.  All right.  What up, Jen?  I love driving through Hempstead real fast.  I finally heard about this on Monday. 
[01:01:30]  Picked up the metro.  What lights?  What red lights?  Yeah.  Yes, Jen.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Go ahead.  That's good.  No, we're done goofing on Hempstead.  Yeah.  We're still allowed to goof on Hempstead, thank God.  You are.  Next thing, you're not allowed to goof on poor neighborhoods or minority neighborhoods.  Go ahead, Jen.  Yeah, I picked up the metro, you know, the free paper in the city on Monday and read the  comments, and I started laughing.  And all my white friends gave me F about it.  Really?  They were defensive about it. 
[01:02:00]  I was like, that's funny.  Of course it is.  Isn't that absurd?  That's actually really just funny.  That's a stupid thing to say.  Yeah.  And it made me laugh, and I got, oh, sorry, I got messed from two different white people.  So, you know, they're like, but Jen, don't you understand?  These are young women.  They're accomplishing something, and they're being put down because, you know.  Wait, what did they accomplish?  I don't know.  They came in second place, and the last time I looked, second place doesn't mean crap  in anything.  Who is it?  You know that, and what's his name? 
[01:02:30]  I forgot his name, too, which kills my whole bit.  The guy that broke the four-minute mile, Bannister?  What the hell was his name?  Chris Reeve?  Slowest ever.  He broke the record.  You know there was another guy that day that broke the four-minute mile, but it came in  second place.  Second.  No one knows his name.  And you don't know the first time.  Roger Bannister.  Thank you, Pal Talk.  Thank you, Huginit.  Yeah, Roger Bannister.  I thought that was the Hulk.  That's David Banner. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, David Banner.  Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile, same race.  Another guy broke the four-minute mile.  No one will ever remember his name.  Yeah.  No one will care.  So what did they really accomplish?  They came in second place, and the game was shown on ESPN, too.  Maybe the other guy just had a name that was known for something else.  Maybe the guy who came in second was Billy Clinton.  Got it right.  Anyway, go ahead, Jen.  Finish up.  I just thought it was mad funny.  Like, why am I getting messed?  Like, aren't I allowed to laugh at that?  Of course you are.  You know, why am I getting messed from my white friends? 
[01:03:30]  See, when something like this happens, a lot of times black people get annoyed at us  because they're like, can white people stop complaining because something's finally not  going your way?  It's not about, like, we feel like victims.  It's just, you know, when a guy does a joke like that, and the whole country reacts like  he cuts somebody, that's what's irritating.  It's like people are being phony and overreacting.  Absolutely.  And, you know, you live in Hempstead, so you're a white friend.  They're not really white now, are they?  Well, they live in Manhattan, so they're a little white.  Oh, well, that's why. 
[01:04:00]  You know, they're white.  Oh, that's why.  Yeah.  They got a little money.  All right.  Yeah, the black community is getting a lot of support from the whites in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed that I live in Manhattan.  Well, those are, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very, very bloody, bloody hearts.  Yeah.  Whatever.  All right, Jen, thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  We're going to take a break.  We got the top ten rap songs in America.  Yep.  Very interesting.  We're going to read some of the lyrics.  Yes, I imagine that these guys are all going to be out of work soon, according to what's  going on with black people.  They have to be. 
[01:04:30]  This is horrible stuff.  Boy, I wonder why I misthought it was okay to maybe say nappy-headed hoes.  I don't know.  Maybe because it's all around him as far as black culture goes and black entertainment  goes.  Oh, boy.  But no one told him or us the rules.  You know what?  That was the same thing.  You know how you'll joke around sometimes and you'll say, like, you used to say, like,  ah, I got cheddar.  Like, just being silly because it's obviously not your word.  Yeah.  That's what that was.  Yeah.  It's like, eh, nappy-headed hoes.  Just using a black term as a stupid joke. 
[01:05:00]  And it was, like, it was so not intended to be angry.  It's out of character.  It's that humor that is based in someone saying something.  Like when those stupid movies make the old lady rap or something.  Or the stupid, the white Republicans are all hip-hop, breakdancing on the floor of some  mansion.  It's one of those things that are supposed to be funny because it's so out of context.  And that's what it's supposed to be.  Like Karl Rove dancing. 
[01:05:30]  Like that same type of a vibe.  There you go.  Out of context.  Oof.  Doing something that's so obviously not you.  And it's out in the open that it's not you.  Karl Rove should have been fired from that.  Absolutely.  That was awful.  This show is moving by really fast.  Also, Whoopi was on CNN last night.  What's the name of her company, by the way?  If we could just say that.  I keep getting reminded of it.  One.  One Ho.  One Ho Productions.  One Ho Productions.  One Ho Productions is Whoopi's company name.  One Ho Productions.  One Ho Productions.  And we had out with her yesterday. 
[01:06:00]  Unbelievable.  Why would I just think that's okay to say?  And she had no idea that I was a comedian.  That's just amazing.  It's amazing.  Did they bring up Ted Danson?  Probably not.  It's CNN.  Do we have the tape from yesterday we played on XM of just a question the reporter asked  Jesse Jackson?  The way people will call black people to cast?  I know.  We got a lot to do, obviously.  We have to kiss.  Yeah.  We'll do that during the break, Jimmy.  I'll check that off my list here.  We have the things we have to do.  No. 
[01:06:30]  Don't check it so we keep doing it.  You scare me.  You were touching butts yesterday with another man.  That was very funny.  Another man named E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Can we maybe play that over here just to get a couple laughs?  Get a sex back and blasted a gasser on him.  It was great.  We'll explain that next, I guess.  And just a quickie.  Fire destroys Johnny Cash's home.  Just giving you a little more info today.  You know the house that was featured in Hurt?  Johnny Cash's version of Hurt is gone.  Is he okay?  Did he get out of it? 
[01:07:00]  Burnt to the ground.  I think one of the Bee Gees ended up buying the house, and now it's gone.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOW-ME-05.  That's 866-WOW-ME-05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:07:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  People are saying this is just one example of how talk turns wrong.  And I'm certainly not the first radio personality to get himself in hot water.  Opie and Anthony lost their jobs for broadcasting a couple having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Hot 97 DJs were suspended for a song parody poking fun at tsunami victims.  It offended a vast majority of people. 
[01:08:00]  But as I was tuning down the radio dial yesterday, I heard a lot of people who said that they weren't offended.  Well, for humor, commentary, all of that stuff being expressed.  It's like when it crosses the line, it begins to build, burn, and destroy bridges.  Imus says his two-week suspension for these comments is appropriate.  The suspension begins on Monday.  Yeah, they're working us into the story a little bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We always pop up when these stories come up because of our sorted past. 
[01:08:30]  We're multiple offenders.  Yes.  That's what the AP is calling us today, multiple offenders.  They'll come for us next.  I have no doubt about it.  I'll just enjoy my time until they say goodbye.  So long.  And we're in the Yahoo top searches for some reason.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know where that came from, but we're higher than Mr. Imus for some reason.  People listening to the show?  We're in ninth place today. 
[01:09:00]  Yahoo searches.  Ooh.  Uh, Jimmy?  I think, I, I, I'm, someone told me this was your idea.  Whoever's idea this was, this was brilliant.  It was my idea!  Ooh.  Brilliant.  Get the top ten rat balls.  But I don't do anything for the show whatsoever, whatsoever.  I just push buttons.  That's all I do.  I didn't say that.  I know.  People are saying that.  No, they're not.  Yeah, they are.  No one's saying.  People are saying.  People are saying that Opie just pushes buttons.  You can read it for your time.  They mean people who are friends with you mean that.  You send them into a rage.  Emotional.  Hey, before we go into that, because that's really good.  There's an observation here.  I, I didn't even know. 
[01:09:30]  Uh, Dave in Pennsylvania, because we're throwing it all on the table.  Dave, go ahead.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, uh, these, uh, Rutger girls are saying that, um, Imus took away, you know, their great  season and degraded them.  But I think Tennessee did all that when they crushed them by, like, 30 points.  Uh, yeah, I think, what was the final score?  I mean, it wasn't even close.  It was over by the first half.  Tennessee kind of embarrassed Rutgers on the basketball court.  If it was them, I would just kind of go away and enjoy their summers. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  You know.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  And the team, look, if the team's reacting a certain way, you know, at least they're willing  to meet with them.  I mean, all right.  They didn't, they kind of got thrown into this whole thing.  It wasn't their doing.  They, they get their asses kicked on national television and then someone calls them nappy-headed  hoes.  All right, they're having a rough week.  Well, I don't.  On ESPN2.  Yeah.  They got their asses kicked.  Semi-national television.  Yeah.  Barely.  So rap lyrics, the top 10 rap songs in America.  For the hell of it, I said, hey, why don't we get a list of the top 10 rap songs in  America?  I said that. 
[01:10:30]  Huh?  I said that.  And, uh, quite interesting.  And it shows, this is why I've been screaming how phony all this outrage is.  Like, this is what Sharpton, remember he brought his daughter in and he goes, this is my  daughter, you're attacking all women.  Every one of these songs is general and about women in general.  And the same wounding is not being felt by black people.  Degrading.  Uh, by the way, uh, Tennessee won over Rutgers 59 to 46.  That's just like 30 points.  What kind of dopey basketball team only scores 60? 
[01:11:00]  Well, when you could, when you have to throw the ball in the hoop underhanded, you know.  Yeah.  You can only score about 60 points a game.  I think the whole team throws like girls.  Yeah.  They don't, they don't look like girls.  Are you still allowed to say that?  Are you still allowed to say that?  Are you still allowed to say that?  What?  You're degrading and demeaning women by saying they don't, uh, look like girls.  All right.  That was a joke.  They look like girls.  They have, uh, long hair, uh, and breasts. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  The top 10 rap songs in America.  Um, it's just the way they, uh, they talk about women.  This is, uh, this is why I'm hot lyrics.  It's, uh, this is the number one, uh, rap song in America.  By Mims, yes.  I think you're right.  Number one.  Yeah.  Uh, niggas say we lost it.  Uh, I love dirty, dirty, cause niggas show me love.  Uh, later in the song, uh, this is why I'm hot.  Catch me on the block.  Uh, every other day, another bitch, another drop.  Uh, 16 bars, 24 pop, 44 songs. 
[01:12:00]  Niggas, give me what you got.  Um, then you want to go later in the song.  And I'm, I'm just skimming through, picking out the highlights.  Yeah.  Um, see my pimping, never dragged.  Find me with different women that you niggas never had.  Um, and in the last, one of the last ones, I keep it so mean the way you see me lean.  And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean.  And, uh, number one rap song in America.  That's obviously offending the entire black community because they're going after, uh, Mims.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm wrong.  No.  Yeah.  Not a word will be, uh, said about that song by Reverend Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson or 
[01:12:30]  anyone else.  He might, he might say something about it, but he's not going to say, demand that the  label drop, uh, this guy and, and just.  And there's a great opportunity here.  Okay.  Everyone is focusing on, uh, this issue because Imus, right?  Yep.  So why don't they jump off the Imus thing and jump into what's really the problem?  Mm-hmm.  This crap in, in, in entertainment.  Reverend Al Sharpton has a platform now.  Why don't you really go after the real cause? 
[01:13:00]  By the way, uh, I personally want like rougher lyrics.  I, I like, I like like NWA and, uh, uh, ghetto boys and stuff like that.  Like, I don't care that these rappers are putting out lyrics like this.  I love it.  But if you're going to be a guy that, like Reverend Al, that is going after Imus, then  you have to go after these guys.  Especially when you're demanding, A, he apologized and groveled and this phony outrage is making 
[01:13:30]  me sick.  The number two song.  And by the way, who's more influential in the black community, Don Imus or these rappers  that we're talking about and reading lyrics from?  Uh, I think they listen to, uh, these rappers a little more than Don Imus.  Yeah.  And how about what you do in your personal life?  Don Imus, uh, has done nothing but help sick kids through these little, uh, these 48 hour  marathons he does.  And he has a ranch and R Kelly, who has the number two song, if I remember correctly, there  was a video of him and a gal that wasn't quite too pleasant. 
[01:14:00]  So I guess that those deeds, uh, and his lyrics are much worse than Imus who helps kids  and, uh, and says one off color thing.  Um, here's some lyrics by, uh, R Kelly.  I'm a flirt.  I'm a flirt.  Uh, I'm a be pimping.  Um, I don't be slippin'.  When it comes down to these hoes, I don't love them.  We don't cuff them.  Man, that's just, uh, the way it goes.  I pull up in the phantom. 
[01:14:30]  All the ladies think handsome.  Jewelry's shinin'.  I stay stuntin'.  That's why these niggas can't stand them.  I'm a chick magnet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And anything fine, I'm baggin'.  It.  It.  Uh, yeah.  It's my little delay, I do.  I know.  That delay makes everyone hurt, though, Mr. Imus.  And, uh, if she got a man, I don't care.  Ten toes, and I want to be, because I gotta have it.  What are they saying, by the way? 
[01:15:00]  I don't know.  They're calling in an attack, I guess.  Down, uh.  I don't even know what this means.  It's about him.  Is this some kind of code word?  No, no, no.  This is what he does.  Can you interpret this for me, Jimmy?  Yeah, he kind of likes to, he like, he's like, I'm gonna be pimping.  It means like, he kind of wants to be pimping.  Yeah.  And then, I don't want, I don't be slipping.  Means that like, he doesn't want to slip.  Wow.  When it comes down to these hoes, like if something's, if there's hoes and something's  coming down to them.  It comes down to these hoes. 
[01:15:30]  I don't love him, we don't cuff him.  Because he's not like, in love with the hoes.  Is, is cuffing, is, is that like, is that like being a couple?  I don't know what that means.  Like, we don't cuff him.  Like, he just wants to kind of have sex with him and be with him.  But like, cuffing, cuffing him is like, when you're, when you're an item.  Yeah.  An item.  Listen to me.  I think that means you want to be a little more serious.  You're serious?  Yeah.  Is that, oh, oh, does Travis know?  No.  Oh, I was gonna say, Jesus, really? 
[01:16:00]  Emo fruit.  He doesn't know anything about the black community.  Look at, like, you want to talk about the way women are dressed.  Look at the last page, the last highlighted lyrics in this one on the second page.  Unless you want to do the whole thing.  But look at the second one.  Right there on the second page of the, of the, of the, of the, of the lyrical masterpiece.  The, um.  Now the moral.  Now the moral of story, the moral of story is cuff yo bitch.  I'm black, handsome, I sing, cause I'm rich, and I'm a flirt. 
[01:16:30]  Yep.  Where's the, where's the outrage for black people?  Why aren't they calling for this to be banned?  Even after the video he did, which was my favorite video he did.  We all saw the one where nobody knew how old the person was, wasn't it?  Ah, they let him slide.  Yeah, why not?  But Imus is disrespecting a team full of young ladies who accomplish something while R. Kelly does.  Do you, R. Kelly, cuff yo bitch?  What about some of these other ones, Jimmy?  Oh, Make It Rain is a gem.  Yeah.  Features Lil Wayne, who I am not familiar with his work. 
[01:17:00]  I think he's on OzFest this year.  Um, this is, uh, better grab an umbrella.  I make it rain on them hoes, I make it rain.  I make it rain on them hoes, I make it rain.  I make it rain.  I make it rain on them hoes, I make it rain.  I make it rain.  I make it rain on them hoes.  That is the number nine rap song in the country.  That's okay.  I'm sure the Rutgers women's basketball team has no problem with this, right? 
[01:17:30]  That was Fat Joe.  And so I think that I'm really sad to see that Fat Joe is not going to be employed anymore.  I'm really sad to see that Jesse Jackson and Sharpton and the Blacks.  That Jesse Jackson doesn't have the balls to sit across the table from Fat Joe.  They are going to protest.  Who are you kidding?  Fat Joe, and he's not going to work anymore.  And poor Whoopi Goldberg, because their company is called, what is it, One Ho Productions?  I mean, is that a shame that that company is going to be protested by black people?  How hurtful. 
[01:18:00]  Hey, Chuck Nice.  I don't know what this means.  Chuck Nice from the Radio Tick Show is on the line.  What's up, Chuck?  Hey, Chuck.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  How you doing, man?  Hey, man, I just woke up.  I heard you guys, you know, doing your thing.  First of all, Jim, I Make It Rain on Them Hoes is a gardening song.  Well, man, rain is very necessary.  Oh, okay.  So he's actually hoeing the ground, and it was raining, and he was upset.  Good point, Chuck.  Let's be for real, man.  I'm not.  It's raining on his hoes. 
[01:18:30]  You need rain when you hoeing, man.  Of course.  Ask any farmer.  So, hey, listen, man.  You know, I just want to say, first of all, what you guys are doing right now is very good.  And quite frankly, there are many, many people in the black community that hate this kind of degradation from black people.  So, if I were black, I would be able to tell you who those people are. 
[01:19:00]  I know.  Wait, the people who don't know Chuck, Chuck is a black fellow.  Yeah.  You know, and quite frankly, for a while, I have been putting together, and I'm going to announce it because you guys are national.  I am putting together a movement myself, and it's called the Bougie Revolution.  And that is, Chris Rock did a joke some years ago where, you know, he said something that he kind of regrets,  but he was trying to articulate the fact that there are many people within the black community that are very hardworking and diligent, 
[01:19:30]  and they are contributing members of society, and we call them black people or African Americans.  And then we have those who kind of, you know, they step in the fence, and they don't care about the image of black people,  and, you know, they call women bitches and hoes and niggas and this and that, and we call them, you know, niggas.  So, anyway, you know, I think a lot of people are angry, and what you're doing is good, calling attention to it.  I don't care.  You know, that's all there is to it. 
[01:20:00]  It just seems to me, Chuck, you know what it is, man?  It's like, again, Michael Richards yelling something angry.  Everyone knows the Imus' intent, and it just seems this outrage is phony,  and they're focusing, like, all this anger about other stuff onto Imus because he looks like somebody you're not going to like.  He's an old white guy.  I mean, I'm white, and he's irritating to look at.  So black people look at him like he represents somebody they don't like.  Well, actually, he does, man.  You know, here's the difference.  You know, Don Imus grew up in a time when black people weren't allowed by law to vote in his country. 
[01:20:30]  So when he says something like that, you know, it's like Colonel Sanders is saying it.  You know, that's...  Kind of looks like Colonel Sanders.  I mean, he looks like a corpse during Reverend Al Sharpton's show.  I thought Don needs some sleep, man.  I felt sorry for him.  He had the really heavy eyelids.  That's the picture they're showing all over the place today.  We've all had that feeling with our eyelids from doing morning radio, and this guy hasn't slept in days.  You know, so here's the thing.  If you're a white guy and you wear a cowboy hat, you need to watch what you say about black people. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, that is the truth.  That's really what the lesson is.  But, I mean...  But if you're a black guy and you're dressed in hip-hop attire, you know, you don't have to watch what you say because, you know, white people are scared.  No, you don't have to watch what you say.  You've got to watch out for getting shot.  Yeah, by another black guy.  I think that's more important than this Imus situation.  That's all I've been saying is, you know, yeah, he said something. 
[01:21:30]  It ended up blowing up in his face, but I think this is getting blown way out of proportion for what he actually did.  I'm kind of glad that it's getting blown out of proportion because, you know, it's a dialogue, at least, quite frankly.  Yeah, but this dialogue might cost a guy his job when it really isn't the punishment fitting the crime here.  Well, you know, it's not going to cost him this job.  He's, you know, quite frankly.  Really?  I didn't even know he was still on the air, honestly. 
[01:22:00]  So, you know, I think it's the best thing that ever happened with Donna.  He's not your demo there, Chuck.  Yeah.  All right, Chuck.  Thank you.  And thank the radio chick for me for helping me out.  Tell her I will never forget that.  Tell her thank you very much.  Tell Leslie thank you.  Hey, no problem, man.  Take care, buddy.  Hey, guys.  Take it easy.  Bye, John.  Chuck Nice from the Radio Chick Show here in New York.  He's the nappy-headed sidekick.  Yeah.  That's what I like calling him.  Jim Norton of the Chick Show.  Right.  He's not nappy-headed, though.  He keeps it tight.  He keeps it tight. 
[01:22:30]  He does.  You got another example of bad rap lyrics there.  These are the top songs in America, by the way.  We wanted to keep it honest and just go with the top songs, not some obscure song that would make our point here.  The top ten songs.  This one right here, there's a bunch of stuff.  This is Rich Boy lyrics.  I miss you who wrote this.  I mean, normally I would know this offhand, but I've been busy.  Throw Some Ds.  Rich Boy's Selling Crack.  F Niggas Want a Jack.  S, Tight, No Slack. 
[01:23:00]  And in the bottom here, we'll get to the point.  A Lot of Hoes, Gimme They Numbers, But I Never Call.  A Lot of OG, Look at VIP and See a Nigger Ball.  And that's the rest is a little bit too.  I don't know what that is.  A Lot of Hoes.  Just bought a Cadillac.  Throw some Ds on that bitch.  Yes.  What does that mean?  Is that Rims?  Ds?  You're asking?  Or is it some kind of like car bra?  I don't know.  Throw some Ds on that.  Car bra on his Cadillac. 
[01:23:30]  Throw some Ds on that.  I think it has something to do with Rims.  Bitch.  I would guess.  Did I say?  Here's another one.  Walk It Out.  Yeah, Walk It Out.  Walk It Out is the.  By the way, Ho is all over these songs.  Oh, yeah.  That's the point I'm making.  It's the number eight.  It's by Unk.  And it's called Walk It Out.  And here's the verse one.  Now hit the dance floor.  Now bend your back low.  She do it with no hands.  And then a couple lines later, I like the way she move.  And undercover Ho.  And then a little later, two Hoes choosing me. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, here we go.  And at the end, my niggas on my side, hate is hating, think it's funny.  I'm walking on these niggas.  Now I'm getting to the money.  Froes on them hoes.  So far, of the top ten rap songs in the country, the one, four, 40% have hoes in it.  Yeah, and other ones have.  The phony outrage that's happening around Imus is just, it's phony.  And all the other ones have some type of derogatory term for women. 
[01:24:30]  Everyone has either bitches or niggas or hoes in it.  The top ten, and Sharpton and Jackson have addressed this.  They have never gone after someone's livelihood this hard.  They have never said, we don't want R. Kelly working.  Never demanded the label drop them.  I think this is an important point.  Now that there is a discussion about this whole thing going on in America,  this is an opportunity for Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson  and the rest of the black leaders out there to drag this whole thing into the discussion. 
[01:25:00]  Everyone is listening.  Everyone's listening.  Yeah, now you got the country here.  Because some of these people say, well, they have addressed this.  Well, have they on a radio show that no one's listening to?  You know, you can get on CNN tomorrow and talk about this.  The same thing we're talking about right now on our radio show.  Call them out.  But the interesting thing, because Jimmy's reading all the rap lyrics,  and like he said, almost every song has hoes. 
[01:25:30]  Or niggas in it.  Right.  The other one that you can't say.  And I want to read this again.  Steve Harvey, because we know radio,  he says if black people want to talk about each other a certain way,  that's their option, he said.  Mr. Imus, you don't have that option.  You can't say what I say.  That is beyond insane in the United States of America.  He's saying freedom of speech is based on race.  Right.  That is literally what he is saying.  Freedom of speech in this country is based on race. 
[01:26:00]  Certain races are allowed to say certain things.  If you're going to have the word...  Steve Harvey is an ass.  If you're going to have the word nappy and the word ho  all over black culture and black entertainment, black websites,  we had a whole list of movies and TV shows and books and websites that used the word nappy.  Today we got lyrics all over the place that have the word ho.  40% of the top 10 rap lyrics.  Then you know what?  Mr. Imus should absolutely be able to say nappy-headed ho. 
[01:26:30]  Why doesn't someone call Steve Harvey out on the fact that he is saying that freedom of speech is based on the color of your skin?  See, when he's saying something like that, like, I mean, we could say what we want.  At a party or, like, Opest Doorbeck getting punched, that's the truth.  Like, if you're at a party and you want to talk about black people a certain way,  the way they talk about each other, you probably are going to get punched.  And that's where that comes into play.  But as far as you losing your job, there cannot be a difference in the rules.  As far as a company firing you, there can't be a difference in the rules.  If you want to say niggas, you're going to get punched in the face, well, that's the chance you take. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, not at my parties.  Oh, no.  Actually, if you don't, that's the password to get in.  First, you've got to lift the hood to see whose face you're punching.  But this is another example of this phony outrage in the black community right now.  This manufactured outrage.  More importantly, Jim Norton touched butts with another man yesterday on the show.  Let's get to the big story.  And it's worth replaying right now.  I don't even know what the hell happened, but somehow we decided it would be a great idea 
[01:27:30]  to have Jim Norton's bare butt against E-Roc's bare butt.  Well, E-Roc screwed something up, so as a punishment, he had to show our live audience  that we had in studio yesterday over at XM his butthawks.  Yeah.  So he did that.  He dropped his pants in front of the big window that we have over there.  And then Jimmy decided, was it you that decided that it would be a good idea for you two men  to actually touch your butt cheeks together? 
[01:28:00]  Eric, yes.  Eric showed, young Eric, might I say, showed his more supple than you'd think backside  to the studio audience.  And I said, let's touch butts.  For some reason, Jimmy thought it would be hysterical to have two men just touch butts.  It's just stupid.  But who knew he had an ulterior motive?  My girlfriend of many, many years ago, we would sleep together in bed.  We'd both be nude.  And when our butts would touch, it would skeeve her.  It was a weird thing.  Like, she hated when butts would touch. 
[01:28:30]  It's just mushy.  That's funny.  A little bit on the warm side in a bad way.  You want to do it real quick?  The weird thing is, no, it didn't come to my lips really fast.  No.  It's just kind of, you know, let me think.  Let me think about it.  No!  I feel like.  What's the delay?  I've got to be honest.  But Jimmy's very, like, smooth and hairless.  Yes.  It's like an Asian or a cancer patient.  This is a man's ass I have. 
[01:29:00]  No, it is not.  This is how it went down yesterday.  All right.  E-Rox is moving in for the butt to touch.  Come on.  Come on.  This is a showstopper, E-Rox.  I swear I won't be mean to you for a week if you do this.  I promise.  Come on.  Everything's fine.  Come on.  Pull it out.  My ass is out, too.  Don't be a f***ing queer.  Come on.  Don't go f***ing half-assed on this.  It shows you're scared of your sexuality if you don't pull out your butt.  To touch another butt?  Look.  Our butts aren't touching.  It's butts.  I'm not gay at all.  Neither are you. 
[01:29:30]  It's fine.  Come on.  Pull down your pants a little bit.  No.  Come on.  Pull your pants down.  You're showing a lack of confidence in your sexuality if you don't get your butt out.  All right.  We got the two butts.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you f***ing homo.  You are a f***er.  I was touching another man's ass.  Did you hear that?  You farted.  You farted?  Oh, loud.  I didn't hear it.  Did you hear that?  I didn't hear it.  Oh, good.  It was hot.  Say that again. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  We're back live.  The video's up on our website.  God, I hope we get fired for that.  He was horrified.  I hope that's the thing that gets us fired.  Yeah, that'll do it.  And I so didn't plan.  I was like, oh, it'd be funny if I could gas on him.  But I didn't think I'd be able to.  And all of a sudden, I summoned it.  And there it was.  And I'm like, oh, he better do this quickly.  And I wanted to do something else, which I couldn't do because it was too creepy.  You had to spin around.  When Eric was facing one way, I wanted to spin around and do this to the ass cheek with 
[01:30:30]  something.  Just slap him.  That's right.  With my hands above my head.  But I don't know.  I couldn't do it because it was.  That's just.  I don't know, man.  It's just something.  It's like because then I'm not going to want to stop.  Yeah.  I'm going to want to straighten him right out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For all those times he's been late, there's something to punishment, boy.  All right.  We'll step aside for a bit here.  Got lots to do still.  Jim Norton at BroadwayVideo.com if you want to come to my HBO shooting June the 2nd in  Washington, D.C. 
[01:31:00]  Those tickets are going to go like that.  Yeah.  They're free tickets.  There's two shows Saturday at the Lincoln Theater.  Just state your name, address, and what show you want to go to.  All right.  Very good.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  We tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:31:30]  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Wow.  Looks like someone's making Jiffy Pop popcorn.  Awful, isn't it?  Oh, my God.  I don't think she's in the room.  Oh, no.  There's another cam up here, but I think she's a, because, well, maybe, I don't know.  We're looking at the lovely women of Pal Talk.  Pal Talk, and there's a girl in here.  She's got very, very sheer panties on. 
[01:32:00]  And something's going on there.  Wow.  She's not adhering to the fashion that is popular these days, which is smooth as silk.  Don't show that video to Mr. I'm.  No.  Wow.  So, just keep it at that.  It looks like she's sitting on the shoulders of Link from the Mod Squad.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Can I say real quick?  I'm sorry, man.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  I don't want to come off like a stick in the mud.  I happen to like rap, and I like the brutal lyrics. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, I hope we didn't confuse everybody.  I don't have any problem with rap lyrics, but if you're going to go after Mr. Imus, why don't  you look within your own community and see what's going on in entertainment?  Are you kidding me?  The more they say niggas and hoes and it's brutal, I mean, I really like that about rap.  It's just rap is brutal, and I like that.  Some are suggesting that we, you know, steal the iPods of the Rutgers women's basketball  team and see what they're listening to.  Jeez.  And then ask them what, you know, why is it okay to be listening to what you're listening 
[01:33:00]  to?  Oh.  But that might be racist, because, you know, maybe they listen to Celine Dion.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Did that groin lose to Tennessee?  It is, it looks like, the way it is, it's a sheer, very sexy see-through.  Picture the Shaw, no, no, picture the Ayatollah Khomeini robbing a bank.  Good reference.  The guy died in 85.  Got him on top of his ass.  Why not? 
[01:33:30]  Hey, by the way, Mr. Imus, I got an email from his camp.  Hey, Ope, here's the info.  It's the 18th annual WFAN Radiothon simulcast on MSNBC and on all our syndicated radio stations  across the country to benefit the Imus Ranch, the Tomorrow's Children's Fund, and the CJ  Foundation for SIDS.  CJ Foundation, started by Joel and Susan Hollander.  Yes, a very, very important cause after the death of their baby girl, Carly Jenna.  Donations can be made with her by calling our toll-free number 877-877-6464 or by clicking 
[01:34:00]  on the Radiothon banner at WFAN.com.  Radiothon runs from 5.30 a.m. Thursday through 10 a.m. Friday.  This is what Mr. Imus is going to be doing before he starts his suspension, by the way,  raise money for a great cause that he's been doing for a very long time.  Yeah, this isn't something he slipped into to make him look good.  This has been in the works for... 
[01:34:30]  I'm sure the media will have some kind of spin on it, like, oh!  But really fast, and then he ends by saying, appreciate your help, as we're concerned that  donations may be down this year, so any plugs are very helpful.  Because now people are going to go, oh, I can't donate to this worthy cause because of  what Imus said.  Yeah, because Imus said something, let's have other people suffer.  Imus said something silly, and this thing he's been doing for years.  Has raised millions, and he has a camp.  And yet R. Kelly, look at the lyrics he has, and look at the video of him out, and the 
[01:35:00]  black community has kept their mouth shut.  How about Ice Cube?  They have kept their mouth shut.  How about Ice Cube?  He's got pretty much the number one movie in America.  Cigars and Scotts, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Yeah, does anyone remember Ice Cube screaming about, like, why we should burn down Korean...  Well, not we, but...  Well...  ...should burn down Korean grocery stores?  No, that's a good point.  I didn't remember that, but I guess he should not be able to work anymore.  But that was okay, because wasn't that in a song?  Yeah.  See, we're learning today it's okay if it's in a song.  Just sing it. 
[01:35:30]  See, if you want to say something a little edgy, you've got to, like, kind of sing it.  That's what we're going to start doing on our show.  We're going to rap.  Good luck.  The house next door.  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  All right, hey, where's David Duchovny?  Please bring him in.  David Duchovny's here.  Be funny if he's out burning Imus posters.  It's kind of a tricky situation with the whole Imus thing going on, because when we have guests, 
[01:36:00]  we don't know where they stand on.  Yeah, let's go to Mike in Babylon.  We kind of make our opinion known.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Love you.  Love you.  Yeah, it's lovely.  Love the show.  Yeah, okay.  Hello, David.  Listen, you guys are like the standard Vera these days.  I mean, like you said, Google is the ninth top search.  I mean, I just think you guys aren't going at it enough.  I mean, at this point, I think you guys should just go charging into the breach and defend it  and, you know, say whatever.  I mean, yesterday, Jimmy, you were on there in the XM side. 
[01:36:30]  You mentioned that joke with the Al Roker bit about, you know, that little affliction,  and, you know, I don't know if you can even say it on this side.  I think you guys should be just trying to figure out a way to come out there and just say it.  Well, sir, we can only do so much here, and, you know, it's just the way it is at Terrestrial Radio,  and we know that, and I'm kind of grateful in a way because the vile nonsense that would have flew out of my mouth  if we had four hours a day to say it.  Yeah.  And the Al Roker, Al Roker's just another jackass, I'll let him say what it is.  Yeah, Al Roker wants I was to be fired over that.  It's completely ridiculous.  But we're watching the situation very closely, and then we might have to organize a little something-something. 
[01:37:00]  I mean, there was a point before where you guys cut the mic off.  I really hope that you're going to give that joke on the XM side.  You'll give it on the XM side.  All right, thank you.  We're not going to get fired.  We've got David Duchovny sitting here.  We're talking to some direct from Jersey.  We're just yammering on, telling us we should curse on Terrestrial Radio and go them.  Well, it's everywhere, David.  What can I tell you?  What, the cursing?  The Imus thing.  You should hear my mother talk about it.  Really?  About Imus? 
[01:37:30]  No.  She has no idea.  No?  She doesn't know how to work her television.  Your mom, too?  Because mine is the worst with technology, and I was trying to tell her, I just saw her for Easter,  and I'm trying to tell her, like, you know, you should get a computer, and it's not this big thing anymore.  She thinks it's like the ENIAC, you know?  It's just, don't they weigh 20 tons a piece?  And I'm like, no, you can check your laptop, you can check your email.  She goes, well, why do I need that?  I don't want to give up one of my guest rooms.  I tell her, when we go on vacation or something, I can send you pictures and stuff.  I can just wait until you get back.  Like, no, I'm not going to Photomat. 
[01:38:00]  I can just...  My mother puts a, like, a sheet over the television when she's not watching it, like it's a bird.  It might make noise in the night.  I don't...  I think she thinks it's radioactive or something.  We gave our mom a DVD player a year ago.  Every time I visit her, I got to, like, walk her through the damn thing, and she still can't figure it out.  Mine still uses videotapes.  Just pops in, like, VCR, and she can...  No, I just rewind.  It's fine.  Like, there's DVDs.  DVDs.  Ooh.  She don't want to hear it.  Yeah, no.  I don't know what it is with people. 
[01:38:30]  When they reach a certain age, they just want to cut off technology.  She does use a remote.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's pretty pretty.  She has a remote.  Swinging with the remote.  Well, I remember my grandfather sitting there with the remote that used to go, like,  made, like, a ding noise.  There were two buttons on it, on and off, and volume.  With a long wire.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if you remember, but when I was growing up, you know, the channel changer would  always break because you just swung it around somewhere.  Yeah.  Pliers.  Yeah.  You'd get yelled at, too.  Sorry.  Stop it.  Your parents could hear, like, a mile away, you going...  Because you had to get from channel 5 to channel 11 real quick. 
[01:39:00]  Stop it.  You're going to break it.  You're going to break it.  We had the thing, like, 25 years.  It never broke.  Yeah.  David Duchovny, you're here.  I'm a television expert.  Yes.  Well, I've seen you on it.  Yeah.  You're a lot taller than you are on the television, but...  It happens.  Yeah, you got to...  People seem to think that about me a lot, and I don't know why.  They expect you to be short?  They do.  Everyone on TV is supposed to be short.  Well, I get there in a little box.  Yeah.  Fit in the box.  Yeah.  Well, the sheet is over it, so he can't just come walking out and get cookies in the middle 
[01:39:30]  of the night.  Like the kids from Willy Wonka.  He comes out of the TV.  I heard, though, you know, I heard that you were tall.  Oh, you didn't hear that?  Yeah.  When you walked in, I was like, oh, look.  The rumor.  He is.  Yeah.  The rumors.  Not rumor.  Pacino is legendarily sweet.  He looks tall because of, I guess, all he's played.  I hear Pacino's just a little shrimp in real life.  Everybody says he's like 5'1".  He's just a little guy.  He's a little fella.  You want to pick him up?  Yeah, he's cute.  Take a picture with him.  You want to burp him.  Come over, burp him, pat his little blanket. 
[01:40:00]  I hear you.  Get back on the set.  Daffy bastard.  The TV set.  That's what we're promoting today, huh?  Yeah.  You guys haven't had a chance to see it.  No.  We don't get advanced anything.  We don't get anything, no.  Really?  I know.  It's a shame.  The only way I get advanced copies, I can't talk about on the radio, or I might have the  FBI come to my house because they have a warning on the front that says I shouldn't  do this.  It's easier to talk about it when you, you know.  I know.  And I actually saw it.  Yeah.  We didn't get an advanced copy.  We didn't even know you were coming until 10 o'clock last night. 
[01:40:30]  Let's just lay it on the table.  We have very bad communication skills.  We knew you were coming X amount of time ago, and we said, yeah, David Duchovny.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden they tell us the day before, ah, David Duchovny's coming.  All right.  Yeah.  We approved you coming in like September 06.  And we got an email yesterday that you're coming in today.  I got this.  We have a little problem in the organization.  Security clearance.  Yeah.  But it's David Duchovny, so you'll let him in.  I told, we had Simon Pegg in yesterday from Shaun of the Dead.  You see that one?  Yeah.  It's a funny movie.  And I didn't want to tell him. 
[01:41:00]  I saw his latest movie, the one where he plays a cop, but I complete bootleg.  Like, I got it.  I heard people eating popcorn in the background, and like, it was really a bad bootleg.  But it's okay.  But it's okay, because I saw the movie, and I was able to talk about it.  Yeah, because we've got to see this so we can talk to the guys.  Yeah.  So, a lot of these times where I see an advanced copy, I'm not getting a screener copy.  I'm getting an illegal bootleg copy.  That's nice.  Yeah.  I've never actually seen one of those.  Oh, they're so bad.  You know, I have, I remember being on an airplane a few years ago, and one of the flight attendants 
[01:41:30]  came up to me and said, you know, I love, I love the X-Files.  I have, I have everything on, all nine seasons on DVD.  I said, that's great.  That's terrific.  He said, and I bought it for 50 cents in China.  Great.  Thanks.  All nine seasons for 50 cents.  That's going to make you feel good.  Yeah, I get some of that.  So, you owe me three cents.  Yeah.  That's amazing, because you're taller than everyone in China, stacked on top of each other.  A little tiny short ship.  I saw that, Jimmy.  I'm still, I'm still, I'm still using the tall thing, huh? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, no, I didn't notice until he said it.  I'm going to go back to it.  I'm going to try to steal a laugh, which didn't work, and I'll take my bombing.  Keep talking about it.  Well, I wonder what the TV set is all about.  Yeah, what's, uh.  You're going to have to really sell it now, because we, we haven't seen it.  Usually, we're kind of informed.  Damn us.  Well, Jay Kasdan is the writer-director.  I don't know if you, if you guys ever watched Freaks and Geeks, or saw Zero Effect in Orange County,  but he's a really talented writer-director.  Sure, and it's, uh, it's, it's basically about the, the, uh, creation of a television show 
[01:42:30]  from writing to casting to dealing with the networks to, to shooting and then trying to  get it on the air.  So, it's, uh, it's kind of a network-type comedy about what it is to actually make television  instead of, like, the usual kind of Hollywood fluff.  Right.  You know, when you see in movies.  But, it's, uh, it's myself and Sigourney Weaver and Ewan Griffith and Judy Greer  and just really terrific, smart, funny actors.  Justin Bateman?  Justine Bateman.  He's great in everything he does.  Justine. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, Justine?  I saw Justin.  When he dresses like a girl, it's amazing.  Well, she's okay, too.  I, I heard Justin Bateman.  I'm sorry, see?  The most, the most uncomfortable thing is that Justin plays my wife.  And drag, I'm sorry.  Is there anything like, if it's about a TV show being made, is there anything like the  comeback, which I loved on HBO with, uh...  The comeback was great.  And the only thing I didn't believe is there was one writer, because they had the whole  weird thing with the writer's relationship with Lisa Kudrow.  Right.  One of them was a little too over-the-top douchey to her.  And it's like, nah, man, writers are never that brutal to you. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  Um, you know, they may hate you, but they kind of hide it if you're getting laughs.  Right.  Is it kind of along that vibe, like behind the scenes of a sitcom?  Exactly.  But it's, uh, it's really the struggle that the, the writer that I play has with, uh,  the network.  And, and it, it's, it's really about, you know, making little compromises every day.  Little compromises.  Oh, I can live with that.  I can live with that.  And then, uh, at the end of the process, you're, you're left with this, uh, piece of shit  that you, that you, you don't recognize it.  So, so just in order to get on the air, you know, to, to have your dream is you're 
[01:44:00]  going to have your show on the air.  This is, this guy's a writer who's worked in rooms for 15, 20 years, you know, now he's  got a shot.  And, uh, so he'll compromise, you know, he's got to feed his family.  And then at the end, it's just, you know, it's what you see on networks.  Well, comedies are destroyed by networks.  Um, they're, they're emasculated, but as I mean, doing the show you did for so many  years, I mean, how much trouble did you guys have being that it was not a comedy?  Like say, was your content that you guys want to cover?  It wasn't a comedy.  I was, I thought that I was.  There was some, there was some fun in there.  Hysterical lines.  So it's not like a Sanford and Son type thing? 
[01:44:30]  No, it wasn't at all like Sanford and Son.  So I'm saying like, no black people.  Here, here, David.  But I'm saying, did you guys have, did you guys have content issues that you wanted to  cover that was not like, that was in more of like a serious vibe and you're like, no?  Um, I think, uh, until you get to syndication, you know, you're, you're always going to be  kind of doing a dance with, with the networks.  Uh, but, but once you, once you hit that number and you, and you get that autonomy of, uh, 
[01:45:00]  you know, you're going, I think you can pretty much do whatever you want.  We had one episode that, uh, maybe people remember, they, they pulled it out.  Maybe.  Come on.  Well, no, there's one, there's just one.  It's, uh, they pulled it out of rotation because it was too kind of sick.  It was about, it's called home and it's about, um, a, a, a kind of family of, uh, of, of  mutant, um, uh, humans who, because they are so.  Incest.  Yeah.  There's a mother in a drawer and the, oh, that one was great. 
[01:45:30]  It's one of my favorites as a matter of fact.  It was so twisted and sick.  It's a lot of people's favorites.  Uh, the, these, these people were so mutated that they, that nobody would have sex with  them.  So they had to have sex with each other in order to propagate.  And, uh, it's a love story.  It's quite a love story.  They pulled that out of rotation.  Now that I'm describing it, that's sounding like Sanford.  So that's out of rotation.  Remember when Lamont would have sex with Brad?  Absolutely.  Brady came in.  But they don't show that anymore?  Uh, they pulled it for a while.  So that, that's the one, you know, for all the kind of graphic and weird stuff that we did 
[01:46:00]  over the years, that was the one that they, that they pulled.  How many episodes did you do or how many years did you run?  Uh, nine.  Yeah.  Nine years.  It was, it was the it show.  I mean, that show was one of, it was the show.  And, uh, then toward the end, I know the last couple of seasons, it just, it got so weird  when you disappeared and then they, uh, they brought in, uh, what's his name?  Robert Patrick.  Robert Patrick.  Yeah.  Uh, who I like, but, but, you know, it was just weird, the dynamic there. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  And it was always like, ah, is Mulder going to show up today?  Is he going to show up today?  Yeah.  He finally came back.  Yeah.  Back towards the end.  But I never knew what like really happened to you.  They just kind of.  Neither do I.  Left it kind of there with the hooks in your mouth and what the hell was going on.  I, I, for, for all I know, I think Mulder, he did a couple movies in that time.  Yeah.  That was it.  Mulder went off and became an actor, did some movies, did a couple of chick flicks, came back. 
[01:47:00]  At least Mulder waited, as opposed to, uh, uh, David Caruso, who has one great season  that goes, I'm going to be a movie star.  And then 15 years, like, no, you're not.  Back to TV.  Uh, Caruso was amazing that first year.  You know, I was, I was, that was some of the best acting I've ever seen on TV.  I was sad to see him.  And now, Frank, it's a whole nother story.  That's pretty good.  Oh, when he does that exit stage left, even.  And he just kind of walks off the screen.  Oh, it's hysterical. 
[01:47:30]  It's become a parody.  Yeah, I had fun with that.  Everyone's goofing on that.  It's, it's, it's hard to do, uh, you know, do a TV show week after week, I, I, I gotta say.  Do you feel like it almost becomes like a parody of what you initially started out doing?  Well, not so much a parody, but, you know, the nature of, uh, television is that you're,  you want to give people, people want to see the same thing.  Yeah, yeah.  They do.  They want to tune in.  They get familiar with the character.  Yeah.  So, you're, you're kind of limited after a while.  I think, actually, the X-Files was, was pretty successful in, in, in mixing it up, you know, 
[01:48:00]  for a long time.  What do you think about, um, Lost?  Because they're kind of calling that like almost like an X-Files type.  Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't know.  Don't watch today.  It's covered by the sheet, so you can't.  It sounds good.  Yeah.  I can hear it coming through the sheet.  He's being polite.  He doesn't like the Hulk.  No, no, no.  It's not that, I don't even not like it.  You've never seen it?  I've never seen it.  Oh, no.  You're playing the Hulk.  That's fair enough.  I think it's fantastic in the sequel.  They get you playing the Hulk.  What's his name?  Banner, the other guy?  I'm not playing the Hulk.  It says right here that you're playing, oh, you're playing the, uh, that you're playing. 
[01:48:30]  No, I'm not playing anybody in that movie.  What happened?  It says here in our one sheet, David is in the new movie.  I know, I know.  I don't, I don't know.  He's under heavy negotiation.  No, no, no.  Not all teaching, of course.  I've never, uh, nobody's ever contacted me about being in the Hulk.  You sound hysterical.  You know how, you know somebody is going to be shot now for putting that in there.  No, but I've, uh, I've been asked that before about the Hulk.  Really?  We have the worst bunches.  That's why I rip it up before I guess here.  I pierced.  Is that correct?  Who makes these things? 
[01:49:00]  What an ass.  This is all, but it says here, it's in, it's in like a bolt.  David is set to become the new one.  Yeah.  Who, who wrote that?  I don't know.  Have them shot.  Now, okay.  I'm going to ask something off the sheet.  Yeah.  X-Files movie.  Another one?  Yeah, in the works.  Okay.  That was accurate.  In the works.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now that's something a lot of people want to see.  I would hope so.  Yeah.  Because if not, we're going to look really silly.  That'll look silly.  Any, uh, any plot line there?  Has anything been written yet? 
[01:49:30]  No.  No.  I don't know.  Will it take off from the end or the last thing?  I don't know.  Are you going to have hook scars in your mouth?  I don't know.  You don't know.  I don't know.  You're not giving out any of that.  No, actually, I don't know.  You just don't.  Honestly, I don't know.  We should think of a catch of wine, but he just says, I have no idea.  He doesn't know.  He's going to be all right around.  I don't know.  Shine the light in his eyes.  Let's make sure.  Wait, it says here, too, and this is the one, I'm sure this is completely incorrect.  Uh-huh.  But it said that being an African-American, you found...  It said that you used to dye, you used to dye to color your right eye and keep your 
[01:50:00]  pupil dilated because you had an injury in high school.  Is that true?  That's true.  Oh, really?  You played basketball.  So, yeah.  I did.  What is that?  How do you dye it?  I don't dye it.  No, I dilate it.  Dilate it.  Okay.  What a bunch of idiots.  Here's what it says, David uses dye to color his right eye and to keep his pupil dilated.  I got to hit somebody.  Wait, who said that?  Who wrote that?  Who?  Point.  Well, because you know when you're trying to make your eyes look the same, you want to  color one differently.  Dye one? 
[01:50:30]  Who dyes their eyes?  Like an Easter egg.  Yeah.  All right, we got Sam.  You are as dumb as they come.  Sam, is that you?  I wrote it based on information given to me by...  Roland.  Passing the buck.  All right, get him in here.  Our staff passes the buck better than anybody.  And I'm also hearing Roland came up with the whole Incredible Hulk thing.  Roland, wait till you hear...  He's only the guy that books the gas.  I like Roland.  Wait till you see the lack of any communication skills he has whatsoever.  I've talked to Roland.  I know.  Oh, on the phone, it's okay.  In person, when he gets a mic in front of me... 
[01:51:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Roland.  There's no joke, by the way.  Go ahead, Roland.  The Hulk premiering.  Explain yourself.  The Hulk was...  I put...  They're rumored.  Really?  It says here, David is set.  Yeah.  Set and rumored.  I apologize.  I always get rumored started with an R.  That's my error.  No, the email I sent, it said rumored.  The what?  It said rumored.  The what you sent?  The email to Sam if it's rumored to be.  Okay, so rumored, and then you took rumored and said that's too long to put on the sheet.  So set. 
[01:51:30]  He's looking for the email right now.  Look at him.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him scrambling.  Of course.  He's scrambling.  And the TV set, have you seen it, Roland?  Yeah, I loved it.  So why don't you give us an advanced copy so we could, like, maybe, you know, comment about it?  I did give a copy.  Can't see?  Wow.  What?  Oh, wow.  Uh-oh.  I stand corrected.  Roland, could you read this?  Damn it.  I think I was watching the Lost Fox set.  I am an ass.  Well, watch it.  You'll really like it.  I will.  It's really, really funny.  Roland has to correct everybody.  Oh, this is IMDB's mislabel. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, I forgot to paste a caption on top of it.  It's been rumored.  So you didn't put rumored in?  You forgot.  I am an ass.  See, we're not that dumb, David.  Someone else that's dumb.  What about the dye colors right on?  Like, dye late and dye.  What about the Easter egg eyeball?  Yeah.  Easter egg eyeball.  You know, in the springtime at my house, I like to pop my eye out and hide it in the backyard.  He'll hide it in a slipper and the kids will find it.  Yeah, how did that come about? 
[01:52:30]  No, I...  How does one dye their eyeball?  It's a dilated, though.  I didn't send dilated.  I didn't send dilated.  You sent dilated?  What happened?  Oh, Sam.  We might have to blame Sam.  He's scrolling through that.  It says...  Blackberry.  It says on the sheet that he uses dye to color his eye and to keep his pupil dilated.  Do you think I just added in out of nowhere?  Yes.  No.  All right.  Oh, now there's another email.  God, you can't get away with anything.  You know what?  No.  Once again, I apologize to Roland.  What?  I apologize to Roland.  Roland, please.  Can you correct us?  This is the email you sent, and we are incorrect. 
[01:53:00]  Again, I blame INDB.  IMDB.  Yeah, IMDB.  I am dumb bastard.  Again, IMF.  All right.  Someone on Instant Feedback is saying this might be the worst interview of all time.  David should just slap the ass out of all three of you.  Why would we like David?  Now, Roland, this is a TV set.  It's funny.  Why is it funny?  Sell it for David Duchovny.  Please.  Because if you see it, that's how the way sort of like Hollywood works for a TV show from 
[01:53:30]  the ground.  But Roland, Roland, if you had no interest in television, would it still be funny?  Yes, it would be funny.  It's great comedy.  Great acting.  So you wouldn't say it's an inside movie.  You'd say it's a movie for everybody.  Bring the kids.  Bring the family.  And Sigourney Weaver.  Sigourney Weaver's in it, Roland?  Yeah, Sigourney Weaver.  She was really good.  Yeah.  And the guy from Fantastic Four, Eon?  Well, yeah, well, Yoan. 
[01:54:00]  Yoan.  He's got a lot of vowels in his name.  When we were shooting the film, Jake said, you know, the geeks are going to go crazy for  this movie because we got Mulder, Ripley, and Mr. Fantastic.  Yeah, that's true.  In the same film.  We're hearing you've got to get Regis and Kelly.  I'm sure they're going to be well more prepared than we.  Is Regis back or is he still, uh, my heart?  I can't take it anymore.  I'm missing Duchovny.  I don't think so.  I love him.  He's so agitated at everything. 
[01:54:30]  I can't believe I won the lotto.  That makes me laugh every time when Regis gets angry.  Oh, and he's a guy with technology.  I love watching him because they bring out a computer.  What's this confounded machine, Gelman?  How does it work?  What do I do with it?  I can't even turn it on.  What's with the internet?  He knows nothing about anything that was made after, like, the 50s.  Yeah, he's got a wooden tennis racket.  A wooden tennis racket.  I hop in my Edsel and go home.  All right, he's got to get out of here. 
[01:55:00]  We have everything, we have everything.  David Duchovny.  Do me a favor.  Watch the movie.  Talk about it some more when you've seen it.  We will.  Absolutely will.  Even if you hate it, you can say that, but I know you won't.  No, we'll see it.  It's called the TV set with David Duchovny.  And if David Duchovny thinks he's slipping out of here before I get a picture with David Duchovny,  it's over, Johnny.  All right, we better take a break.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I'm called, though.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  I just got wowed.  I got wowed.  I'm Sam, I just got wowed.  Oh, thank God for Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:55:30]  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  Details on...  God forbid we mention a website.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  All right, let's stop the show for a second here.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony and acknowledge...  I had a skid to a stop.  And acknowledge how bad that interview was. 
[01:56:00]  What?  That was a great, fun interview with David Duchovny.  It just didn't go in the normal interview format.  I got excited and said,  Oh, Justin Bateman.  I love Justin Bateman.  He's great in everything.  And then you stress it.  He's great in everything.  He's great in everything.  And he rolls his eyes like,  Where the hell am I?  It's like, Justine Bateman.  I'm back to Justine.  So you dye your eyeballs?  No.  You're going to be the new Hulk?  No, I'm not. 
[01:56:30]  By the way, it's Jason Bateman.  I know.  I said Justin.  Yeah, Jason Bateman.  Justine Bateman is...  Justin Bateman.  I got all excited.  I'm like, Oh, Justin Bateman.  Because I looked down really fast.  As you said it, because I read that before.  I'm like, Oh, no.  I looked down really fast.  I'm like, Is Justin Bateman's in this movie?  I got to see it now.  Because I like what Justin Bateman does.  There is no Justin Bateman.  It's Jason Bateman.  He's some guy from Schenectady.  Right.  It's his sister there, Justine.  And the company's married to her in the movie. 
[01:57:00]  He was very cool about it, though.  He just knew he was talking to a group of asses.  Oh, yeah.  He was hilarious, though.  And then, what else did you guys say?  I said the Hulk thing, and then dying the eye.  Here's an interesting tidbit I found out.  Which was not a tidbit.  It was just a boob who read the internet.  Yeah.  And then, the whole thing with the Hulk.  So, you're set to play.  You're going to be playing the Hulk?  No.  No, not.  But it says here, you're set to play.  No.  How would I?  How would I?  How would I?  I haven't even talked to anyone.  It's a rumor that's going around.  And you keep thinking you're catching a lion. 
[01:57:30]  Come on.  You've seen Law.  He didn't like it.  No, no.  I've just never seen it.  I never saw it.  It's Patrick Bateman?  No.  It's Jason Bateman.  Yeah.  It's Jason.  Patrick Bateman is that fun-loving guy.  Yeah.  No, you had the J, right?  Yeah, all right.  The color is bone.  That's good enough, right?  Right?  By the way, his movie comes out.  We should mention it.  I don't think the date was on.  Why would it be on the one sheet?  None of the other information was pertinent.  It comes out.  Dude, you know what?  I didn't even know it was a movie.  I thought it was a TV show.  I do.  So, tell us about your new TV show.  I think I even said that.  No, that's the title of the movie. 
[01:58:00]  Well, it's one long season.  It's an hour and a half, and it's in theaters.  Because it says, the movie is the TV set.  The TV set it's called.  I swear to God, I thought he was promoting a TV show called The TV Set.  I had no idea.  It is, I believe, out now and limited release.  And April 20th, it comes out.  In all fairness, though, I got an email yesterday, and I was a little pissed off last night.  It came to our attention that we approved having him in September 06.  Yeah, yeah.  We had some kind of meeting in September 06.  Beginning of September, they had a meeting. 
[01:58:30]  October, November, December, January, February, March.  We're talking about seven months ago.  He said, do you guys want David Duchovny?  And at that point, especially, we were looking for good guests.  Yeah.  Like guests with names.  Yeah.  And we said, yeah, we want David Duchovny.  And then they told us yesterday that he was coming in today.  Because we said yes six months ago.  And it was late last night when we were all getting ready for our nappies, our long nappies.  Now, I say thank God it was David Duchovny because I'm a huge fan of the X-Files. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  I think he's a very funny guy.  I've seen him in other interviews.  Sure.  And the guy has a natural sense of humor.  He doesn't need, like, other people around to kind of bring the funny out of him.  He's a funny guy.  So I wasn't that worried about it.  But just the thought that you booked someone six months ago and then they tell you the night before, hey, by the way, he's coming in tomorrow.  Don't worry.  We'll have all the info you need.  The Hulk.  The dyed eyeball.  The X-Men movie. 
[01:59:30]  The X-Men.  Justin Bateman.  And the gay marriage plot.  We're usually prepared.  We know ahead of time we try to do a little research.  But, man, this one took us by surprise.  You've got to give credit to David Duchovny.  He rolled with it.  He had a blast with it.  That was fun.  When we're prepared, the mics don't work.  When the mics work fine, we have no idea what we're talking about.  It's one thing that's going to go wrong.  Yeah.  And thank you, Take The Way from FBA.com.  Yes, Jason Bateman in Arrested Development.  I loved that show.  And, yes, it was very, very underrated. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Grab the box set, man.  It's a hilarious, hilarious show.  And we got this.  Hilarious, hilarious people.  I never saw it.  Patrick in Richmond.  Hey, Hope.  I can't believe all of the news about Dan Imus.  Hey, do we have time to wrap up?  Actually, Don Imus.  Don Imus.  I am dumb bastard, huh?  Come on.  I know.  Come on.  I've been going over and making sure I get the letters in the right order.  I like it because it's funny because M is spelled with an A. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  But the M.  Yeah.  Still worked.  Absolutely.  Beautiful.  I think we have time to go over.  Hilarious.  Hilarious people.  Hilarious.  Whoopi on CNN talking about Imus last night.  Now, we had it out with Whoopi on our show because she thinks that he should be fired,  I guess, right?  She wouldn't commit to saying he should be fired, but she was saying as much as Trent  Lott got fired, which is a totally different thing, but I couldn't even jump in to say  it. 
[02:01:00]  She's talking about politicians who have some accountability.  They're supposed to represent the masses, which is everybody.  It's a serious thing.  Not a comedy show host on a radio program.  They affect people's lives, politicians, because they make policy decisions.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a different level of accountability because there are guys who make decisions  which would govern our lives.  And if you got the moniker shock-jocked and, you know what, hands off.  This isn't NPR.  This isn't network news.  We're just dopey morning radio shows trying to entertain people. 
[02:01:30]  We should never be held up to the same standards as news people and politicians.  It's just, and I think this is some archaic carryover from the old Edward R. Murrow days  where they used to come in with a suit and tie and they needed this air of respect and  they had to be people that you could trust because they were giving you the news.  It wasn't like, when Uncle Miltie got on the radio and did his show, people aren't looking 
[02:02:00]  at him for news.  Right.  You know, he could do what he wanted and be funny because he wasn't held up to the same  standard as Edward R. Murrow.  Yeah.  You know, why did that go away?  How come you can't be a comedian on the radio and be funny without people looking at it  like it's some serious thing that you're putting out there?  I think we all need to look at a morning show like you would look at a movie.  A movie or a TV show.  Maybe a rap song.  Yeah.  Maybe a rock song. 
[02:02:30]  Same thing.  We're injecting our personalities into who we are on the radio, but I'll be honest with  you.  It's not a 100% accurate portrayal of who I am because I'm leaving some stuff out.  I got to tell you, man.  I don't come on the air and put 100% of who I am on this program because, first of all,  some of it's boring.  Some of it's racist.  What?  Extremely racist.  Some of it, I'm teasing, of course, not really extremely.  When compared to who? 
[02:03:00]  When compared to, I don't know, old A.H.  No, there are some parts of your life that you don't bring into it because it doesn't  fit.  But you're not playing a complete character.  It's almost like Seinfeld on the Seinfeld show.  That was part of Jerry Seinfeld's character.  His name on the show is Jerry Seinfeld.  It wasn't an accurate portrayal of who Jerry Seinfeld was, but there was a lot of his personality  in the character. 
[02:03:30]  So when he did certain things on that show, did the Jerry Seinfeld that lives his life  every day have to pay for it?  Yeah.  No, because people understood that that's a different thing than your real life.  It's weird.  There's people out there that think we should have some kind of responsibility.  There's rules that we have to follow, FCC regulations.  And besides that, anything should be able to go.  Yeah.  We're not held to the same standards as Walter Cronkite was.  It's ridiculous to think a comedy show, just because it's on the radio, has to be held 
[02:04:00]  to these standards.  We are losers in life.  Thank you.  We realized a long time ago that we could get on a radio station, and in my case, spin  records for many years, and then move into a talk show format.  We didn't want real jobs.  I didn't have to work anymore.  We didn't want real jobs.  We didn't want responsibilities.  None of that.  Yeah.  We wanted to entertain and make people laugh. 
[02:04:30]  And to hold Imus to these crazy standards is completely ridiculous, especially the fact  of which we've said many, many times, there was no hate in his voice whatsoever.  And this might shock some people.  You should even be able to have a little hate in your voice on the radio.  That's why speech is protected.  It's because of things that offend and upset people.  Why would you need freedom of speech if everyone agreed and loved what you wanted?  We're talking about.  You wouldn't need it because no one would care. 
[02:05:00]  You have the freedom to say awful things in America.  Right.  Last time I looked.  And why does civil libertarians always go after guys like Bush?  They always go after conservatives.  Why are civil libertarians not screaming that this is protected speech?  Why is like the ACLU and all these people not jumping up and at least vocalizing the  fact that as unpleasant as it is, he has the right to say it.  He has the right to say it.  The ACLU probably would defend him, but this is a case where a guy said something.  We all know why.  I don't want to reiterate the whole thing.  We know why he did it.  The black community is using him as a catalyst about other things that they're angry about. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  This phony rage directed at Imus should be directed where the root of the problem is.  Yeah.  Not Imus.  Not an old white guy who physically represents what you don't like.  Imus is Reginald Denny's head right now.  He's representing.  It's not the actual thing.  It's just something you want to smash a brick into if you're black.  Perhaps a toilet.  A toilet.  And by the way, starting to do a little dance.  Starting tomorrow, Imus will be raising millions of dollars for sick kids.  Stupid Reginald Denny.  Hit the gas, you idiot. 
[02:06:00]  Of course.  He stops.  He goes, you guys need anything?  Hey!  There's 30 guys in the truck.  Need a hand?  This slows down.  What is this?  Put a toilet over my head.  What is this?  Funny joke.  Marshall Warfield years ago said about Reginald Denny.  They beat his ass.  I would say they hit him with everything but the kitchen sink, but I'm butchering her  Greg show.  Yeah, well, that's very good.  Yeah.  But let's not forget, Imus is going to be raising millions of dollars for sick kids starting  the farm.  Which he's been doing for years.  He's not just doing this.  Oh, what a scumbag.  That's why Al Roker's a douche and the rest of them. 
[02:06:30]  Imus has done so much more with his career than stupid fat Al Roker.  Yeah, what have you done, Al, besides not be able to control your eating and hide under  an umbrella for a cheesy morning show?  It's going to be a sprinkle out today.  Yeah.  Bring your galoshes.  You dope.  Let's put the two careers side by side and see who's done better with their career and  has helped people.  This is Al Roker, by the way, is I think he's plagued his whole life with being a black guy 
[02:07:00]  who doesn't come off with any street cred with his constituency, with the community,  the black community.  So this was his chance to get a little bit of street cred, to jump on an easy target  that everyone else has jumped on and saying, look, hey, look, my brothers, I'm with you.  I'm not just, you know, the black guy that smiles and laughs at the two white hosts that  I have to work with and gets criticized probably relentlessly about his act on that show. 
[02:07:30]  So this was his chance to go, hey, look what I'm doing.  I'm standing up.  I'm one of you guys.  Finally a chance to be poignant, you phony, and you take it on a guy and you know what  he meant.  You spent your whole stupid career not being able to control your eating.  I'm hungry.  I can't stop myself.  Where's my umbrella?  That's what you do.  You're a Hummel.  You're a fat Hummel.  You should be on my grandmother's mantle.  Just a little fat guy holding an umbrella with your little hand out.  Oh, drop of rain. 
[02:08:00]  It's raining.  I'm in an umbrella.  What did Anthony say yesterday, too?  Before he got his stomach stable, even the umbrella couldn't keep from his waist getting  wet.  Yeah.  His big umbrella and still his belt got wet because it's just a little bigger than the  diameter of his stupid umbrella.  That's a great lie.  Hey, you guys want to end the show with a what, asthma?  Yes.  Just to make people go, oh, my.  We're going to give people an oh, my.  As long as we're allowed to come back here tomorrow and do a show. 
[02:08:30]  Well, they're going to look at their radios and go, oh, my.  Oh, my.  Here's your oh, my of the day.  I see nigger brown on here.  Like it says right here, nigger brown.  I thought maybe they spelled it wrong.  That's the first thing that came in my mind.  It's a pretty hard word to misspell.  Doris Moore's daughter found it on a label on her new couch.  I was in the kitchen when they were delivering it.  After they left, my daughter came to the kitchen to me and she told me, mommy, what's nigger  brown?  I didn't even know what that word was and I didn't even heard of the word. 
[02:09:00]  Doris called the furniture store where she bought the couch several times, but she didn't  get any answers.  So City News went in to talk to the manager.  Do you see anything wrong with it?  I told you to get them this sofa out and I don't like this kind of thing.  Oh, boy.  I didn't catch that story.  It did sound like they were talking about a new Tarantino film.  No, that's Jackie Brown.  That was Jackie Brown.  That was a few years back.  Yeah, apparently there was a couch with a tag on it and the color on the tag was offensive. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, nigger brown.  And I've seen a photo of it and it was not just there.  Yeah, yeah.  It was somewhere else.  And this little kid found it and asked her mother, what is this?  That was actually the color.  Did they get to the bottom of where that came from?  Well, the reporter tried.  Let's see what happens here.  So I'm going to call the supplier to see if he's still selling this product.  I'm just a trader.  I bring from China and I sell to the stores.  But are you going to stop selling them? 
[02:10:00]  Yes, definitely.  Back at the Morehouse, this whole thing has seen a first-hand lesson in racism.  The seven-year-old Olivia.  They teach me that that word is a bad, bad word.  Work.  Even though the product was made in China, Doris plans on lodging a formal complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission.  Oh, those wacky Chinese.  Those Chinese are crazy.  Oh, boy.  Made in China.  Don't buy your couches made in China.  You think they're just sitting there like, watch this, watch this. 
[02:10:30]  Watch what we said to America.  We're going over to XM now.  Yeah, we got to get out of here.  Can I wear myself one more time?  Yes.  HBO special one hour being shot in Washington, D.C.  It's why I canceled the improv.  What?  June 2nd.  Is that a June 2nd?  Two shows, the Lincoln Theater, a one-hour HBO special.  I wanted to do it in D.C., and I am doing it in D.C.  For tickets, just put your name, email address, and which show you want to attend to jimnorton at broadwayvideo.com. 
[02:11:00]  These are free tickets, and these will be sold-out shows, so please respond quickly.  I cannot wait to do this.  And he's hilarious, people.  Hilarious!  And it's all different than my half-hour special.  Yeah.  Hopefully the boys will be there for that.  That's why Jimmy hasn't been on the show the last few months.  He's missed a lot of days because he's been working on that hour.  I've been working on my hour.  It's going to be a killer hour.  Guys, thank you so much.  You never know when the last day of the opening of Anthony's show is.  I assume we'll be back tomorrow, and I'm not trying to be dramatic. 
[02:11:30]  It's just the times we live in these days, unfortunately.  So, by the way, yeah, yeah, from 1955.  Holy.  We'll see you next time.  I will do you with Mount Wednesday.  It's the O.B. and Anthony's show.  All right, ladies and germs. 
[02:12:00]  I'm going to be in Seattle.  My first time ever.  April 27th and 28th.  It's Giggles.  206-526-Joke.  206-526-Joke.  April 27th and 28th.  Giggles in Seattle. 
[02:12:30]  No, no, no, no. 
[02:13:00]  No, no, no, no. 
[02:13:30]  No, no, no, no. 
[02:14:00]  No, no, no, no. 
[02:14:30]  No, no, no, no. 
[02:15:00]  No, no, no. 
[02:15:30]  No, no, no, no, no. 
[02:16:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:16:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The guy's a panicky Pete.  He didn't know what to do.  Disaster hit his city, and he had no clue.  Hey, we got a one-man audience today.  Cromwell.  Cromwell.  Hello, Cromwell.  It's Cromwell. 
[02:17:00]  He's the only one that made the walk today.  So you better laugh for a lot of people today, Cromwell.  We're all counting on you.  All right, Cromwell.  How do I know his name?  I saw him outside.  I went, that's Cromwell.  You see his little picture.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Cromwell.  At least you didn't take pictures of us today.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  I do believe you probably have a hundred of each of us.  More than that.  Probably more of Jimmy. 
[02:17:30]  Let's be honest.  Whatever.  Cromwell.  Hello, Cromwell.  What's your name?  Yeah, that's my message board name.  Yeah, it's a message board name.  Did you bash me on the board?  No, I never.  Hi, Cromwell.  Not Cromwell.  That's it, Jimmy.  Cromwell's a good egg on the board.  Okay.  Welcome aboard, Cromwell.  Sit down, Cromwell.  Cromwell's delicious mystery appetizer.  Cromwell.  Cromwell, people.  Welcome to the show, Cromwell. 
[02:18:00]  We got someone that disagrees with us?  No, we don't.  No.  How could that be possible?  Bullshit.  There ain't even a way anyone could disagree.  Well, first, we'll take our only call from Canada.  We take one a day.  So, Lisa from Toronto better make it good.  Lisa.  Yes.  Welcome aboard.  What's up, Lisa?  Thanks.  Thanks very much.  It's Lisa Starr here in Toronto.  Hi, Lisa.  Hi.  Hey, Lisa.  Is it snowing up there?  No, but it's going to have a big, giant rainstorm today, apparently.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we're not from Canada.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you want to talk about?  Nothing I just want to tell you is that, you guys, I've never been more repulsed and  delighted by a couple of men in my whole life.  Oh.  Hey, girl.  Yeah.  I think you've changed my whole attitude towards generally the public and politically correct 
[02:19:00]  bullshit.  Yes.  Thank you.  We're working on the entire country up there of yours.  Hey, Lisa.  I'll stop calling people retarded and all those other things when people start arguing about  nothing.  Hey, Lisa.  Yeah.  Why the Chinese in Toronto?  I've been in Toronto a few times.  Yeah.  I need to understand why the Chinese love Toronto.  False advertising at the strip club, too.  You walk by, you see the big posters of the hot American girls. 
[02:19:30]  And then you walk in the club and dancing in there.  It looks like a fucking scene of apocalypse.  Where are you going?  Yeah.  Because everywhere I go, we have the best time at the strip clubs.  You must be going to, like, the worst places.  Yeah.  Because we go, like, pretty much every week.  Yeah.  And there's some hot little pieces of numbers that are happening.  Can I tell you something?  Very few Canadian vaginas have smelled nice.  I've only hooked up with a few Canadian girls.  And a couple of them have been very good.  But most of the...  80% of the Canadian pussy that I've smelled has been awful.  I don't know how to phrase... 
[02:20:00]  No disrespect, but it has smelled like fucking sauerkraut in a cadaver mouth.  Steve, where are you going?  No, see...  Again, I know the pussy, too.  And I'm like, I don't know...  Language, please.  There we go.  Let me talk, Canada, to Lisa.  Lisa, when I go to the Canadian Ballet, when I used to live in Buffalo...  Ah, the Canadian Ballet.  You would see the young American women stripping right over the border.  But when you get up into Toronto, it was all about the Asians. 
[02:20:30]  You've got to go to the rail.  You've got to go to the rail or for your eyes only.  It's all Russians.  Oh, fuck the Russian strippers.  Oh, Russians, yes, very good.  Well, there they are.  Make the sexy for you.  The sexy dance for the money.  Where is the money?  You give to me the money, I make the sexy dance.  We make sexy time for you, yes. 
[02:21:00]  Ah, yeah, we don't like Russian strippers.  Okay, well, yeah, well, I don't know what else.  Other than those white girls, but there's some really good places to go.  I always go.  One of my girlfriends works in one of the places, and we always go hang out with her  and pretty much do our own little wow show.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, who are you rooting for in the playoffs there?  Now?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  Really, to tell you the truth, I'm not a hockey fan.  I'm a baseball fan, and I'm always a Giants fan.  Everybody knows I'm a traitor.  A Giants fan? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I was from the West Coast.  What else can I say?  Hey, this was a very good call from Canada.  Oh, my God.  Yay!  All right, thank you.  Jimmy's laughing.  Woody Allen is a fucking genius.  What did Woody say?  There was some kind of a tribute to Diane Keaton.  It says, Woody gives a funny little valentine to Hall, a perfamed performer.  They dated for years.  He put her in sevenest pictures.  But Monday night at the Film Society of Lincoln Center tribute to her, Woody Allen said,  Diane Keaton isn't much to look at, and he said, she's not beautiful in the conventional  sense.  He said, by conventional sense, I mean pleading to the eye. 
[02:22:00]  And could the news people stop asking Diane Keaton when she's going to settle down and get  married?  Oh.  You haven't figured that one out yet, news people?  We can speculate, can't we?  It's kind of like Liberace on talk shows.  Oh, when are you going to settle down and get married?  Well, I'm looking for the right person.  I don't know he's gay. 
[02:22:30]  Remember that?  Oh.  Well, Merv, I'm just waiting for the right person to come along.  Someone with a cock.  The right gal.  We interrupt this program.  Oh, my God.  Why now?  We're in the middle of a riff.  Who saw this coming?  Jay in Alabama.  What's up, Jay?  I got a midget sighting.  All right, Jay.  Love you guys.  Love you, Jay.  I mean, Jesus.  I know it's hilarious.  What?  Yep.  There was a shwaggy cop pulled me over, and I drive a little Honda Civic. 
[02:23:00]  Yep.  I wasn't paying attention.  Well, that's why I got pulled over, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was going 47 in a 35.  You got to leave that car to the Hispanics.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  I love their little Honda Civic.  I was drinking a Coke and rolled down the window to give him my driver's license, and  I looked over at him and had to look down.  He was a little bitty guy.  You got pulled over by a little bitty cop? 
[02:23:30]  There ain't no midget cops.  I think there's a height requirement.  There's a player to God.  In Alabama?  In Alabama.  You got to at least look like you're getting somewhere when you run, so I don't think he's  a cop.  Yeah.  How's he going to chase people?  Hey, come back.  You're stopping the name of the law.  I'll shoot you on the back of the knee.  I'll see his gun is dragging on the street as he's running.  Hit you with his stick.  It's a little township.  I don't think he's full-time, but he wrote me a ticket. 
[02:24:00]  I had to turn you guys down because y'all were scared to death.  You were afraid we might say something bad?  I knew you would.  Well, the perpetrator, I pulled him over, noticed he was driving erratically.  He steps up on your little, did he have to step up on the little part of the door?  No.  To say hi to you?  He had to reach up to get over the edge of it.  And his little big-headed guy and his little stubby fingers, you know, grabbed my driver's 
[02:24:30]  license.  But the good thing about...  See, we're not really feeling this midget sighting because we don't think it's possible  to be a midget cop.  He's lying.  I don't know if you could be a midget cop.  There's probably some kind of requirement.  There's a height requirement.  Yeah, what county was this in?  It's in Lauderdale County.  Lauderdale County is a little township called Hillsborough, Alabama.  Hillsborough, Alabama.  Hillsborough, Alabama.  Yeah, it's a little crossroads.  Alabama, man.  We're going to take you to task on your midget sighting today.  We're going to see if you're telling the truth. 
[02:25:00]  He tasks me.  Well, I am.  Thank you.  Meanwhile, back at the show...  Faggot.  Fucking...  What?  It's embarrassing that I would consider myself in the same business as Woody Allen.  How fucking funny is that?  That is hysterical.  By conventional, I mean pleasing to the eye.  Pleasing to the eye.  And you can completely picture him saying that.  He's fucking brilliant, man.  He is fucking brilliant.  That daughter fucker is funny.  Oh, my God.  I think it's good tasting chicks.  Why not? 
[02:25:30]  You'd be a little Asian.  Who doesn't like him?  Let's say hi to Dee.  Dee?  Hi.  Hey.  Hey, Dee.  What's up?  You want to play Slave Girl?  No, not this morning.  All right.  So, look.  I have a question for you.  I listen to you guys every day.  It's Dee.  Hey, Dee.  Ooh, Raj.  I'm telling mama.  Listen.  I liked Dee.  Yes.  I am a 32-year-old black woman.  I have no idea what a swiggy is.  Doobie Brothers. 
[02:26:00]  Those people don't listen to the Doobie Brothers.  Yep.  All right, Dee.  Hey, you remember when the Givens kids were there?  A bubbling brown sugar.  Brown sugar.  Something, something Harlem treat.  A bubbling brown sugar.  My favorite was when Mabel King left and they had a party and they sang the song,  We're having a party.  Yep.  While mama's away.  It could be the greatest song ever sung on television. 
[02:26:30]  Can we find these?  Let's hope so.  I know.  What's happening songs?  I'm doing these.  Not that one.  Not that one, you what's happening hack.  This is the theme song where it looked like Rerun was having a heart attack chasing the  truck.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Because they were trying to ditch him.  Yeah, he was laughing.  Yeah.  And Raj was doing the only thing he did until Malcolm X, where he fucking...  I have to get like all that stuff out of my phone.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Are you all going to hit me?  Brother Minis, they wanted me to pay you closer to your car.  You made us think of what's happening.  We love that show, girl.  I sure do.  Yeah.  I sure do.  And Mabel King, who I like in The Jerk, when Steve Martin's like, I'm going to stay 
[02:27:00]  this color?  And she's like, I'd love you if you were the color of a baboon's ass.  All right, Dee, let's go.  Before we lose her, she's got a good question for us.  Dee, go ahead.  Yes, I do.  I'm a 32-year-old black woman in the South, and I have no idea what a show gear is.  Yes, you do.  Oh, damn.  No, I don't.  You don't know you do.  Well, it's some kind of, we honestly don't know where it comes from, and the faithful  listeners know, but we'll say it really quick.  When we were in Boston, we got in a lot of trouble, and for something, I don't even know 
[02:27:30]  what it was.  Yeah, whatever it was.  We were always in trouble.  And then we put out a CD, and we wanted to give money to a charity, and every charity  said no to us because, you know, it was dirty, dirty money coming from us, even though we  were trying to help.  We tried to help the Jimmy Fund, matter of fact.  That was the one we wanted, which is, you know, helping kids with cancer.  But they said, no, keep your money.  We'd rather see kids die than take your money.  Or at least that's how I perceived it.  And then finally, after everyone said no, it ended up becoming the minority homeless 
[02:28:00]  vets of America or something like that.  So basically, black dudes that were in Vietnam.  We were helping out with our CD.  And Bruce Mittman came in with a giant check because he was going to have a photo op, and  I swear to God.  Bruce Mittman was our general manager.  He was a little short Jewish guy.  And he liked just playing golf and smoking pot with young hot chicks that used to listen  to WAAF.  Yeah.  But let's not talk about that because he thinks he knows when we're sounding good and when  we're not sounding good.  Right.  But how would he ever have enough time to listen to us when he's trying to get high with young 
[02:28:30]  hot broads backstage at the shows?  But maybe I didn't see that.  I don't know.  Anyway, I'm babbling.  So Bruce comes in.  We're trying to do our show.  He's got the giant check, and he's off to do a photo op because he was all about getting  his midget little body in the paper.  And he goes, because of you guys.  What was the exact line, though?  Because I don't want to ruin this.  Because of you guys, I had to spend my afternoon instead of golfing giving this check to a bunch 
[02:29:00]  of shwoogies.  So apparently, his word for black gentleman was shwoogie.  And I don't know if it's some Yiddish thing.  I don't know.  We have no idea if it's a real word, but a word that Jewish people use.  I don't know.  We adopted that word that day.  We took it as our own.  All right.  Well, I thank you very much.  Love you guys.  And I wish they'd leave Don Imus the fuck alone.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Leave him alone.  As a black woman, are you into Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson?  What's your thought on those two?  No, not at all, because I think that it is not good for anybody to be one-sided.  It's not this simple.  You can't handle life and think about yourself, your class, your race.  You can't do it.  Yeah.  Hmm.  It makes sense, even though our phone's crapping out.  I don't know how you made sense.  All right, Dee.  Thank you.  Goodbye, Dee.  All right.  Bye.  We got Paul in New York.  Paul?  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, Paul.  How you doing, kid? 
[02:30:00]  I'm claiming floozy for the white people.  Yeah, if the blacks have ho, we want floozy.  Floozy, yeah.  Floozy?  We definitely want broad.  We want chick, even though the Wayman brothers try to take chick away from us with the Hot  Chicks movie.  But I think chick is a white term.  Chick.  Broad.  Dame.  What was the other one, Ant?  You had a good one.  Um, there was another one in there.  Damn it.  Broad chick.  Dame.  All right. 
[02:30:30]  Toots.  Toots.  We want toots.  And we also want floozy.  Floozies.  That one is ours.  Gal?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, gal.  Gal.  You're never going to see a rap song with gal in it.  Yo, I was with my niggas, and I saw that gal.  That gal.  Hey, we got Eric.  Eric.  Oh, boys.  How's it going?  What's up, Eric?  Hey, man.  Listener, man.  And I'm really digging what you guys are doing.  Lil' Jimmy Norton is fucking hilarious. 
[02:31:00]  Thank you, Mr.  Love Jimmy.  And, uh, Antony.  I gotta ask you, man.  These voices, this Don Imus, man.  You should quit doing that because, man, you really, really sound like that guy, man.  I mean, it's, like, incredible.  And, I mean, I was fooled for about two seconds by damn self, you know?  Why are you crediting Antony with my voice?  Hey, Jimmy.  I do.  That's the only impression I do.  He gave you accolades.  Hey.  Can we call shows today as Imus?  I was thinking of doing that.  Who's broadcasting right now who will believe this? 
[02:31:30]  So we got Don Imus who wants to clear his name.  Yep.  Here's what we do.  Here.  Find out.  Someone help us out.  Who's broadcasting right now?  It has to be after 10 when he's off the air from 10 to 11.  All right.  And get a black station in New York where Imus has been, um, any black station and say, Imus  wants to call whatever.  Yeah.  And, uh, Imus wants to talk about, talk about, um, what he wants to say to the basketball  team.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Because it's going to be in a private location, but he wants to, um, you know, let the people  know where he stands with that.  Ow.  Or you should call.  And then, and then, no, because he wouldn't call himself, would he?  Oh, yeah.  Like, I'm the producer.  Just say I'm the producer or something like that.  Try to get it.  And then what I'll do is, I'll actually make a real good valid point and then hang up.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, yeah, yeah.  We better not let Anthony do it because he might mess it up.  Yeah.  All I'll do is give a good phone call.  I say we call.  Yeah.  I say we call CNN. 
[02:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, you're not happy about all the, the, the take, uh, they have on this whole  thing and then he wants to, and I want to clear my name.  I need to, uh, uh, clear my name.  All right.  Uh, Eric, thank you.  So, you like the show?  Hey, punch it out, boy.  All right.  Eric from Atlanta.  All right.  Mm.  Whoopie.  We had Whoopie on our show.  Whoopie.  It's amazing that she's going to, like, uh, blow off the fact that, uh, Imus is a comedian. 
[02:33:00]  Well, uh.  She's going to go with the black-white thing.  Yeah, but she was involved with something similar, man.  Come on.  Well, that's what we're going to get into.  I'm looking for the Whoopie call from you.  Okay.  So, Whoopie, uh, we had it out, out with Whoopie yesterday.  And then, uh, last night she was on CNN.  Do you think the two-week suspension is enough for Don Imus?  I know.  We'll find out.  We'll find out.  I mean, he's, he's going to luck out, isn't he, really?  How do you mean?  Well, you know, uh, when Rush Limbaugh said something on Tward on the television when he was a sportscaster. 
[02:33:30]  He was gone.  The other sportscaster who cast aspersions on the Spanish player said he was concerned his wallet might not be there.  He was gone.  Jimmy the Greek, he was gone.  So, if all Don Imus gets is two weeks, I think he's getting off rather well because everyone else, including Trent Lott, you know, got busted down for saying stuff.  Wow.  Comic, you idiot.  Comic.  Who didn't get in trouble for saying stuff? 
[02:34:00]  Dave Chappelle.  Mm-hmm.  Um, and every, white comedians.  So, why are you putting him in the class with people who are sportscasters who went outside of, sportscasters are not supposed to make racial jokes.  No.  They're sportcasters.  Comic comedians and, uh, comedy radio personalities are supposed to make racial jokes.  They're supposed to involve humor, yes.  That would be like if, if, if Brian Williams of NBC Nightly News made a racial joke, he'd be fired.  Why?  Because he's a news anchor.  Yeah.  Sportscasters, that is outside what they're supposed to do and they know that. 
[02:34:30]  If, uh, Jay Leno, during his monologue, made a racial joke, he wouldn't get fired.  He did make a racial joke.  It was a brilliant racial joke.  Because he's, he's a comedian hosting a show where, uh, where he gets up there and does, uh, comedy monologues.  Isn't it amazing that Whoopi doesn't see it this way?  No one sees the context of this.  Another phony, another phony outrage by the black community.  That was just Whoopi being phony, uh, about how angry she is and where is all of this focus on rap. 
[02:35:00]  If you want to go after somebody who has influence in the black community, don't just give your bullshit summits or your, your stupid lip service.  We encourage our community to not buy rap lyrics.  Fight to have them unemployed the way you're doing with Imus.  Yep.  All right.  With that said, uh, she goes on.  It's kind of funny to me that people are shocked and surprised that people are calling really for Imus's head, you know, but the precedent has been set that there is a certain standard with broadcasting. 
[02:35:30]  Now, if you're on a stage and you're doing a routine, you have a lot.  We say there should be no difference.  What, what, why is that difference?  God, Whoopi.  In a freedom of speech issue, with being an entertainer, why would you, in a convenient place where you perform, expect a certain freedom, a certain license that others don't have?  How about as a musician?  Yeah.  Do you have it there?  An author, a poet?  Right.  Everyone has it but broadcasters?  Yeah, where, where is, where are the places you have freedom of speech and where are the places you don't?  As an actor, you do, as a comedian on stage, you do, as a singer, you do, as a writer, you do, in a play, you do, but not as a broadcaster, uh, I don't get it. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, yeah, on the radio?  No.  With that, we say hi to Jay Moore!  Hiya, boys.  Holy shit!  Oh, my God, I'm bowing to the microphone!  It's fucking Jay Moore!  Oh, my God, Jay Moore!  Hi, Jay.  Hey, you're telling me that Don Imus says these girls are not beheaded ho.  If that's your story, you're sticking to it. 
[02:36:30]  That's what you're telling me.  Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and trick.  I can't be fated.  I'm a nigga from the motherfucking streets.  Somehow it doesn't sound very authentic coming out of you, Jay.  Well, I'm a nigga from the motherfucking streets, y'all.  I hear you.  Yeah, who sang that little ditty?  That would be Dre.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Legend.  I like Busta Rhymes albums, because he actually rhymes nigger with nigger. 
[02:37:00]  Who doesn't?  I wanted to congratulate you boys with that fucking smashing overhand right to Whoopi's  eyebrowless face.  Yeah.  Eyebrowless face.  Fucking hypocrite.  What a fucking eye-bang, average-looking white guy hypocrite.  He bangs more average-looking white guy than Paul Mooney.  I am on fire today. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at Jay.  He comes fucking busting into the joint with both guns blazing.  Oh, yeah, he is.  I've had it.  Hey, congratulations on the custody thing yesterday.  Oh, you saw me?  No, the Larry Burkhead thing.  No, I don't know.  I'm with you.  All right.  Well, I mean, I can't tell you how many people go, God, am I the only one?  Doesn't it look just like Jay Moore?  He looked like me with a touch of Down syndrome.  Yeah, just the touch. 
[02:38:00]  I thought when Charles Barkley said, see, this is why I hate white people.  When did he say that?  It was when he was playing.  Somebody was interviewing him, asked him something he didn't feel like answering.  And he's married to a white woman.  Yeah, he is.  Yeah, well, that might have got him off the hook.  No, it's the eye thing.  I love, are you guys collecting a lot of things that blacks have said that were super racist?  Yeah, we're trying to get audio.  We're trying.  We're not doing so well so far.  Yeah, we want like radio shit from shows like militant black shows where they just call for the death of whitey and things like that. 
[02:38:30]  Who's your ass, those fucking weirdo failed message board ops that can't get boss at the 10th place on a pole?  Some fucking nation you got.  Come on, everyone, let's fucking vote for boss.  I've voted a thousand times, really?  I have a ghost mouth that's been voting all week.  Well, congratulations, you got beat by a dead guy and a lesbian. 
[02:39:00]  Short of uncomfortable laughter.  Fuck them.  Not at all.  No, we've, uh, yeah, we've bashed the boards.  Here's my impression of me on that board.  Hey, good to be here.  Hey, what's it like to eat Nicky's cunt?  All right.  Ah, he speaks the truth.  Oh, it is so funny.  I love the threats Jay gets involved in.  And it's like, he's all nice, very courteous, nice, fun.  And then two posts down, there's got to be, you know,  Oh, Jay, you fucking suck. 
[02:39:30]  What's bald cat's cum taste like?  Yeah, there you go.  There's always got to be some fucking dick bag.  Oh, do you hate him?  You want to reach in and fucking pull him out and punch him?  I haven't been back since.  Like, you know what?  See?  The internet is the world's largest bathroom stall.  You write whatever you want and you move on and no one ever sees you.  Bathroom stall.  It is without all the fun of the hole in between the doors.  Yeah.  Without the...  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, he didn't.  What's your take on the Imus thing there, Mr. Moore? 
[02:40:00]  First of all, you're all correct in that Anthony's Imus is astounding.  Thank you, sir.  And after I hang up, if I can just take like a minute, just if you can talk.  Maybe you're sick of it, but whatever.  I love you a lot.  Could you do this for me?  Hi, I haven't talked to you in a year.  Do I'm it?  I'm walking.  And then this is what I've noticed is people that don't apologize, it goes away. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  And Coulter.  Yeah.  Billy Packer.  Yeah.  Billy Packer and Charlie Rose said, I want you to come to the final four, but you always  sag out on me.  And everyone wanted them to apologize.  And he said, not only will I not apologize, I'll probably say it again.  Good.  See?  And then it goes away because they go, oh, he's not going to fucking apologize.  We're not going to get any press out of it.  So fuck it.  Imus went on a whole apology tour.  He's sucking up to everybody and they still want his head. 
[02:41:00]  But don't you think Imus now has lost any credibility?  Like when he goes back on the air, who's going to look like, ugh.  It's like watching your friend get his ass kicked that you thought was so tough.  Oh, no.  He's castrated now.  It's my bodyguard.  It's that movie, My Bodyguard.  Leave me alone, Moody.  Moody.  I love Ruth Gordon.  I just wanted Linderman to rape her at Razor Point.  Is this your bike?  Well, hold on.  Wow.  Okay, hold on. 
[02:41:30]  Wow, am I a nappy-headed boar?  Is this your bike, tough guy?  Yeah.  I saw him in an eatery yesterday, Matt Dillon.  Did you?  Yeah, my soon-to-be-ass girlfriend and I were eating.  Oh, Jesus.  And I wasn't talking to her and she's like a celebrity walked in.  I'm like, who?  She went, Matt Dillon.  And I just punched her.  You saw Matt Dillon?  Yeah, because I thought she meant from Gunsmoke.  He redeems himself with a 1971 reference.  Oh, what a shitbag.  You suck. 
[02:42:00]  He's super hot in real life, right?  He looked like he put a little bit away.  I've met Matt before.  Let him down easy, Jim.  He's a good-looking guy, but he looks like he put on a few.  But I've met Matt before, but people are saying.  Still dreamy?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you can't not jerk him off.  He was so good in Crash.  How would you not?  I'd let him dump in my hand and I wouldn't eat it, but I wouldn't wipe it back on his face either.  What a trooper. 
[02:42:30]  Hey, the MCs are fighting back.  Bob in Cleveland.  Check out the main page, MTVnews.com.  Snoop Dogg says, and I quote,  don't dare compare his lyrics or any other MCs to Imus' inflammatory comments.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Why not?  Because they were real gangsters and Imus is just an old white guy making a funny reference.  I want to hear Jay sing more rap.  I like that Dr. Dre song, because you's a bitch, nigga.  You's a bitch, nigga. 
[02:43:00]  And then Snoop Doggy Dogg says, y'all acting like whole-ass niggas.  And then he goes off to do a fucking commercial for some product that gives him no street cred.  I don't understand what these guys' problem is.  The whole thing when Kramer said nigger.  Yeah.  Is my wife had an excellent point.  She said, look, you know how Carlin has the seven dirty words you can't say on television?  Are we going to make it eight or not?  If you can't say it, if I go on Tonight Show, I can't say cocksucker and neither can Denzel Washington. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  So we either put it on the list and we stop talking about it,  or you can't get mad when someone says it.  That's what we said this morning, Jay.  Exactly.  If you're in the mall and you yell, fuck, people are going to look at you like,  what's the matter with you?  Are you talking like that?  Well, if you yell nigger, they'll probably do that, too.  Yeah.  Or fart.  Depends on the law.  Well, no.  You know what?  There's any word there's going to be personal consequences for you.  If you say nigger to the wrong guy, you're going to get your teeth knocked out. 
[02:44:00]  But it's like fat pig.  That's legal.  You can say that, but if you say it to the wrong guy's wife, he's going to punch you in the face.  The wife's a fat pig.  Exactly.  And then you get punched.  Yeah, and you're like Steve Shariffa punching out fucking Gandolfini.  How good was that?  That was great, but that was the only thing that was worth watching.  Yeah, the rest of it was on Golden Pond.  Huh?  Huh, Jay?  Jimmy's more of a film style than I think any of us.  You've got to admit, that fucking Monopoly scene, from the moment it started,  I got a bad feeling about this one, Bob. 
[02:44:30]  I was so uncomfortable the whole time before anything happened.  You knew something was going to happen.  Yeah, they're not just going to play fucking Monopoly.  I didn't see that.  Just going there looking at each other, the way it was shot.  I thought it was an, I give it an A.  I thought it was excellent.  I just thought that episode should have been a couple weeks in.  I think they should have started off with a bang.  The ratings were way down, like two million less people watched.  It's probably just because last year sucked.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Good point, good point.  And other people were saying it didn't have a big opening episode because this was actually 
[02:45:00]  part of last season.  It's like the middle of last season.  I loved it.  I loved it when they woke up and she just goes, is this it?  Well, boys, I just wanted to tell you I love you.  When are you going to be in New York again, sweetie?  Well, I'll visit Matt Dillon at Eatery's.  Who knows?  I'll be on the next jet.  Why not?  Well, come on in there.  I'll show you where he was eating.  I'll tell the seat he was in.  I looked over at him.  I walked away.  It was nice.  I saw Rob Lowe. 
[02:45:30]  I was actually on shopping.  I saw Rob Lowe get out of his car at the valet.  The guy was like so fucking hot.  I felt gay just looking at him.  He just kind of glides in.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Look at Rob Lowe's fucking smoking hot.  And I'm like, wow, I'm looking at a guy talking about how hot he is.  You ever see a guy so good looking?  Use four fingers.  God, that's why we love Jay, man.  We miss you, buddy.  Now, Jay.  I miss you.  Bad mouth Ron and Fez now. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, please.  Now you're back with us.  Yeah, screw those guys.  Come on.  One team or the other, man.  One good beating.  Come on.  Fuck those guys.  It's one or the other?  Yeah, fuck those guys, right?  It's a long time coming.  You know it.  Hey, Anthony calls.  I know.  I can't even fake it.  I love those guys, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, I call when Jay comes on just so we could, you know, sometimes talk.  No, no, no.  You've been in studio.  You guys go in the studio.  Hey, oh, shut up.  Me and Jay actually got into a tiff about who had the biggest douchebags, Jersey or 
[02:46:30]  Long Island.  You know what my wife said?  She said you're both right because both places suck.  You never hear people from good places defending it.  You realize that, like, yeah, you realize that as you're arguing, it's like the same  people.  I think Jersey and Long Island are like the same fucking people, only we can make fucking  left-hand turns.  They allow us to make left-hand turns without having to do a jug handle.  I think what has to happen, you've got to pick three really bad towns on Long Island  and three really bad towns in Jersey, and then we play with it a little bit. 
[02:47:00]  Well, Irvington, East Orange, and what's the third one?  I don't know.  I'll trade your Wyandanche, Brentwood, Camden.  Yeah, you blew off Newark.  Camden.  You blew off Camden and Newark.  What's wrong with you?  What, me?  Yeah, you should have went with Newark.  Or are we going with White Trash?  I'm going Brentwood, Wyandanche, and Mastic.  Oh, shit.  No, you dickhead.  I'm talking you got blacks and Hispanics. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, Brentwood is a scary, scary place.  I'm so tired of the blacks being so angry at everybody, and I just had to call and let  you guys know that I support Don Imus, too.  Very good.  Jaymar is on Imus' team.  Well, Steve Harvey doesn't.  Steve Harvey apparently thinks freedom of speech is based on skin color.  Well, Jay said it, too, so I just want to, maybe Jay wasn't listening earlier, I just  want to say it again.  Steve Harvey does a morning show here in New York.  He says, if black people want to talk about each other a certain way, that's their option, 
[02:48:00]  he said.  Mr. Imus, you don't have that option.  You can't say what I say.  That is, that's insane.  That's freedom of speech based on skin color.  Hey, how about we work it the other way and see how fast we get thrown off the air?  Right.  Saying we can say this, but black people can't.  Absolutely.  Give it time, Anthony.  Yeah.  I know.  That's my policy at my house.  Don't worry.  That's my policy at home.  All right, boys.  Since no black people ever come over.  I had a joke and I have to hear about how I suck.  No, no, no, not at all.  No, not you. 
[02:48:30]  No, the message was, Jay Moore was on for the first time in months and he sucked.  Everything's all right between him and the boys.  Hey, what was the actual place Rich Voss came in on that comedy session?  I don't know.  Jesus.  I don't know.  That's a full out of soap.  Like, all you have to do is fucking hit click on your computer.  Yeah.  And these fucking dopes, these fexos, can't even get him into the top ten.  You got to see by, like, fucking lesbians that sing with Katie Lang.  Wait, what was it?  What was the competition?  They blew it.  Comedy Central. 
[02:49:00]  Comedy Central's best comic.  Yeah.  And they were trying to get Voss up there.  Couldn't even get Voss up there.  And he fucking lost to who?  Who did he lose to?  Flight of the Concord?  Mitch.  Like, Mitch Hedberg and fucking that lesbian comic.  People I've never heard of.  Ant.  Like, literally, people I've never heard of.  And it's like, you're telling me these people have, like, an entire fucking nation behind  them voting all the time like Voss does?  Yeah.  Or is this fucking big message board nation a bunch of, is it the same 30 fat fucking queers? 
[02:49:30]  Wow.  And we got slightly distracted because they handed us the complete Snoop Dogg soundbite here.  Wow.  Snoop.  Read that one, the third paragraph.  Is he wearing a shower cap?  Yes, I think he is.  He says it's a completely different scenario, said Snoop, barking over the phone from a hotel  room in L.A.  Jesus.  Rappers are not talking about no collegiate basketball girls who have made it to the next level 
[02:50:00]  in education and sports.  We're talking about hoes that's in the hood that ain't doing shit, that's trying to get  a nigga for his money.  These are two separate things.  First of all, we ain't no old ass white men that sit up on MSNBC going hard on black girls.  We are rappers that have these songs coming out of our minds and our souls and are relevant  to what we feel.  I will not let them motherfuck as we say in the same league as him. 
[02:50:30]  Kick him off the air forever, he said.  Ban him like they did Adam Pac-Man Jones.  They kicked him out of the NFL for the whole season for numerous violations, blah, blah,  blah.  But this punk gets to get on the air and call black women nappy-headed hoes.  What a fucking hypocrite.  What a hypocrite.  How about all the bad things he says in his exclamation?  And remember, for shizzle, for shizzle, buy a blackberry, yo. 
[02:51:00]  Dude, the way he's treated women with his fucking, walking them in on a leash at an award  show, he walked women in on, which I think is fantastic.  Jimmy, calm down.  Calm down.  You're right, you're right, you're right.  But to sit there, hold on, let me just get this anger out.  All right, now I feel better.  Now, for him...  Disgusting.  Jay's right, this is just nonsense, who gives a shit?  But the bottom line is, yeah, but he's doing commercials, mainstream America is not going  to, he will not suffer, and he's on gun charges, the guy does all this shit, and there's not  one ounce of repercussions for him. 
[02:51:30]  Imus makes one off-color remark of the own band forever.  The black community's outrage is phony.  Yeah, Snoop Dogg's doing commercials every two seconds.  Yeah, there's no repercussions for him.  What, Jay?  I wanted to hear more about Jimmy talking about Imus' remork.  I mean, he made a remork?  Hey, remork.  Shame, shame, shame.  Get out the core.  Get out the core.  Get out the core.  Get out the core.  That's right.  For that remork, that was a Compton thing. 
[02:52:00]  Break yourself.  Break yourself.  All right, everybody's hurt yelling at me.  Oh, no.  I feel I have no self-esteem.  We've got to say goodbye, Jay Moore.  Goodbye, Jay.  I'll see you boys later.  God bless you.  Thank you guys, the more.  All right.  Stay white.  Yo, stay white.  Yo, stay white, my brother.  Hey, dude, let me hear some Imus when I hang up, okay?  Uh, yeah.  Bye-bye.  That's all you got.  I'd like to thank Jay Moore for calling in the program today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, jerk.  Hey, Imus, can you take us to break?  And remind people we're going to play more Whoopi audio from Tina. 
[02:52:30]  I want to apologize that we have to take a commercial break.  No more apologizing.  All right, I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You know, you're never going to say nappy again on your radio show.  Never say the word apologize or apology.  I'm sleepy.  I'm going home and taking a nappy.  Can I take a nappy?  Or do I have to say I'm sleepy, I have to nap?  Why don't you work hoe into your show nap?  Uh, I worked on the ranch. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, I was, uh, working with a hoe on the farm.  Yeah.  And I needed a nappy.  So I took a nappy after the hoe.  Nappy hoe.  Isn't that an Indian tribe?  Uh, yeah, the nappy hoe.  The nappy hoe.  Indians.  Right.  They're prevalent out there.  I think we should all give them, uh, anthrax blankets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Now the Indians are pissed at me. 
[02:53:30]  Ah, fuck them.  Man, they don't have power in America.  You don't have to worry about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, uh, whoopee audio when we get back.  Whoopee.  And some shocking quotes.  Fucking slammed down on an eyebrow-less face.  Jay killed today, man.  God damn Jay.  Who are you, Cannon?  Bye.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking.  They do all the talking for us.  We're in Anthony.  Whip him out Wednesday. 
[02:54:00]  Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks.  Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks.  Lick on these nuts and suck the dick.  Yeah, it's the fuck I wanna be young.  I used to know a bitch named Merrick Wright. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  I used to roll around and fuck the hoes that night.  Tight than the motherfucker with the gangster beat.  And we was balling on the motherfucking conference street.  Peace.  This shit got deep and it was out.  All right, let's say hi to John in Chicago.  John, what's up?  Hey guys, how you doing?  Hey John.  Hey John.  All right, so I'm gonna be a little critical of you.  You guys keep railing on Al Sharpton for, you know, being very critical, for being so  critical about Imus.  And you're saying, oh, what if, you know, Sharpton doesn't believe in freedom of speech, 
[02:55:00]  yada, yada, yada.  But what about you guys?  I mean, what's wrong with Al Sharpton using his freedom of speech to criticize Imus?  We're not saying he shouldn't, dude, we're not saying that.  We're saying that he's a phony, inconsistent hypocrite who's trying to cost the guy his  job under the guise that he had, that Imus did something offensive.  And yet Al Sharpton, I have a list of things he did from Pagonis to the white interloper remark,  which people got killed over.  He, he's, he can criticize all he wants.  He is, he is, he can criticize all he wants. 
[02:55:30]  We're not saying that.  He does have that right.  He's trying to cost the man his job.  Well, you got to do, you know, how, you know, freedom of speech is a right in America and  yada, yada.  I've heard it probably 20 times in the past, uh, in the past two days.  And every time it's just been driving me nuts.  But why, why is it driving you nuts?  And stop saying yada, yada.  It's not 1991.  Why do you, why is it driving you nuts?  Why is it driving you nuts?  Because you're, you're, you're so, you're so, uh, you know, adamant about Imus's freedom 
[02:56:00]  of speech.  What about Al Sharpton?  No one is trying to cost Al Sharpton his job.  He can say anything he wants, but he's trying to get Imus fired.  That's different than having a freedom of speech.  That's a threat.  That's taking.  What about in America?  We have the right to boycott into.  And you, uh, easily assemble.  No one said, well, dude.  Let him boycott.  We're not saying they don't have the right.  We're saying that they're phony with their outrage.  And why aren't they doing it to rappers?  Why are they hitting this guy for an innocent remark that was supposed to be funny, much  harder than they would ever have the balls to hit the rap community? 
[02:56:30]  You explain that to me.  Right.  You are absolutely right.  Then you have no point.  We didn't say they don't have the right to assemble.  We don't want that right removed.  We're saying that their outrage is phony and misdirected.  All right.  We did say.  You're never going to win this one because you're wrong.  All right.  We did say you have the right to say horrible things in America.  Why did you do?  So, uh, you know, translate that.  We didn't like what Reverend Al was saying.  And we never said he shouldn't be able to say it.  And we're pointing out where this guy has said these outrageous things and has suffered  no repercussions at all. 
[02:57:00]  Right.  So, Imus has the right to say horrible things, but Sharpton doesn't have the right to be  We never said.  Dude, okay.  They both have the right to say horrible things.  And, uh, we, we hold strong that Imus shouldn't be fired for what he said.  And let's say, let's, let's, let's, Sharpton wanted to be.  Why can't Sharpton call for Imus's, uh, firing?  He can.  You dope.  He can.  We didn't, we didn't say that he shouldn't be allowed to do any of those things.  But why is no one calling for Sharpton?  Why is he being considered a possible presidential candidate for the Democrats when he was screaming 
[02:57:30]  about white interlopers?  And he went, when, when the Jewish guy ran over that black kid, he was saying diamond  merchants.  Why is that not being brought up in the political spectrum where he can make a difference?  And he's the one screaming about Imus.  So you explain that difference to me.  He's an idiot.  Okay.  Well, no one is saying that he can't protest.  So why do you keep making a point that we're not making?  I'm just saying don't make this a freedom of speech issue.  It is a freedom of speech issue.  You dope.  It is.  He's trying to restrict Imus's freedom of speech. 
[02:58:00]  We are not trying to restrict him.  No, we're not.  You fucking idiot.  He says whatever he wants.  He can say whatever he wants.  Why can't Imus?  Well, Imus can too.  Why can't other white people say whatever they want?  No, we're being told we can't.  We are being told.  This is a joke.  I cannot say certain things and words that people with black skin can say.  That is freedom of speech based on skin color, right?  Go ahead.  Your turn. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  Okay.  Is that a good thing?  Freedom of speech based on skin color?  All I was saying.  Answer his question.  Exactly.  You're a dumb motherfucker.  You should have went with the yada yada yada thing.  Yeah, exactly.  More Seinfeld references, stupid.  I should have stuck with that.  Speaking of which, here's to Kramer.  Thank you, John.  Jesus.  All right.  Tipping one.  Fucking dope trying to be different and make a point.  Shut up, young Republicans club lawyer.  Here's more whoopee on CNN and then last night. 
[02:59:00]  It's kind of funny to me that people are shocked and surprised that people are calling really for Imus' head.  But the precedent has been set that there is a certain standard with broadcasting.  Now, if you're on a stage and you're doing a routine, you have a lot of leeway if you're a comic.  Because that's part of his argument is, look, I'm doing comedy and this was part of the comic bit.  I don't know. 
[02:59:30]  I didn't know he was a comic.  I mean, I didn't.  You know, I know Don.  I've never met him, but I know Imus from being a kid.  He was a disc jockey when I was a kid.  And that's how I know someone.  So I didn't know he was a comic.  You don't know anything about him.  So because you don't know he's a comic, he isn't a comic.  Maybe not a stand-up comic, but look at the difference.  All people are trying to do is they are trying to justify why what they want to say or they deem acceptable is okay and why they can vilify him.  It's all this trotting around the issue dog shit. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Well, technically, if you're honest, or if you're here, everyone's trying to explain why what they're saying is okay and what he's saying is wrong.  Right.  Why it's okay for a black guy to say it, why it's not okay for him to say it.  And she said somewhere in there there's standards in place.  Yeah, there's not.  The FCC has no.  There's not standards in place for what Imus said.  Guess what?  The FCC is not going to find Don Imus for nappy-headed hoes.  No.  Sorry to break it to you, but the FCC is going to be like, we got busier things. 
[03:00:30]  It's not on our list.  So the standards are in place.  Yeah, he was well within his means.  He's following the FCC regulations.  And how come broadcasters then, okay, you want to go.  She does a morning show.  She doesn't even know the rules.  How come they're not.  She doesn't even know the competition that Imus has been a comedy show for his entire career.  40 years.  Why aren't broadcasters being thrown off the air for playing rap lyrics that have hoes in it then?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm not talking about profane, but if a broadcaster can't say hoes, why can a disc jockey play songs with hoes in them? 
[03:01:00]  It's inconsistent.  Yep.  And they're all trying to justify why they can say what they want and he can't because  he's an old fucking white guy and they just want to strike back at the white community because  they're angry and they're misdirecting their anger once again at an easy target.  That's what Snip said.  He goes, first of all, we aren't old ass white men that sit up on MSNBC.  It's funny.  You don't have a problem doing commercials with old ass white men and hawking AOL where you  and Lee Iacocca or whoever it was playing golf.  Wasn't that an old ass white man you were with during that? 
[03:01:30]  And why is he able to do that with all the crime he's committed and the...  The drugs he talks about, smoking blood.  He advocates doing drugs.  Yeah.  He advocates being a pimp and prostitutes.  He walked girls into one of the award shows on leashes.  Yeah.  And that's all acceptable and it doesn't hurt him in the advertising world at all.  And he's with Lee Iacocca in a fucking commercial and there's no problem.  No one's outraged.  Where's Reverend Al saying, why are you hiring this guy?  Why isn't he trying to get Snoop Dogg thrown off of these commercials? 
[03:02:00]  When he directly influences pop culture, Snoop is one of the biggest things in pop culture.  And look, he should be able to do all that stuff.  The way Snoop is treated is the right way.  There's nothing wrong with any of what he's doing.  Of course.  I don't care if he smokes pot or fucking raps about everything.  Good.  Everything should do.  Just don't fucking self-righteously complain about Imus.  He should be saying, Imus is an old cornball.  I don't give a fuck what he says.  That should be how he responds.  I just got to communicate.  You know who's been great through this whole thing is John Minnelli.  Got to give him props when props are due. 
[03:02:30]  He's been great.  He's all about free speech and being able to say whatever the hell you want on the radio.  He writes me.  He just sent this.  It says a subject that has come to something as ridiculous as this.  Today's Washington Post cites the following as its first example of alleged incendiary statements made by Imus over the years.  In March, Imus's executive producer and longtime sidekick Bernard McGurk said that Hillary Clinton was trying to sound black.  Remember this?  We did this story.  Yeah.  Was trying to sound black in front of a black audience during a recent speech on civil rights in Selma, Alabama. 
[03:03:00]  McGurk added that Clinton will have cornrows and gold teeth before the fight with Obama is over.  That's hilarious.  That's very funny.  That's fucking funny.  Come on.  But they're now reaching for anything that Imus has said over the years.  That's a very funny line.  That is a funny line.  Cornrows and gold teeth.  Yeah.  Why would you think black people have that?  Oh, you own a television.  Jesus Christ.  That's a funny picture in Hillary with cornrows and gold teeth.  Of course it is. 
[03:03:30]  Because she was.  She was talking like that.  Do we have that anywhere?  I mean, we have that somewhere.  I was born and raised.  I'm from.  Shut up.  Yeah, she threw a little accident on her.  Hey, more from Whoopi.  All of these reverends and the, you know, the civil rights leaders, they've been fetching about the lyrics for years.  Years and years and years.  Years and years.  There's a demonstration.  Please, I mean, for years.  So it's a little bit weak.  And I always want to ask folks, why do you want to say it? 
[03:04:00]  I mean, you, it's like the N word.  People say, well, you all say it.  Well, yeah, but why do you want to say it?  Why do you want to say it?  Because you know, you know, Imus is not a rapper.  So we know he's not putting together some material.  Okay.  There's another instance of where you can't say it.  He's not a rapper.  All these reasons why blacks can say it and whites can't.  Why don't black people just cut the shit and it's either consistent or it's not?  Why don't you just admit, we want to say things that you can't.  Stop fucking tap dancing around. 
[03:04:30]  Again, you sound like suburban white women.  Yeah, that's racist.  Just spit it out.  That's some kind of black rule you're trying to get in place.  And this is America.  Like, we're not going to accept that, that black people can say certain things and white  people can't say the same things.  You're crazy.  And Whoopi said they've been complaining about the lyrics for years.  Yeah.  And nothing has been done.  Complaining.  Tiss, tiss.  Don't do that.  Why not a boycott?  Why not a complete boycott of any store that carries the lyrics that you're objecting to?  Why not a complete boycott?  A big group of black people and Jesse Jackson and Reverend Al marching in front of a store 
[03:05:00]  to have a black artist removed from the record store because his lyrics are degrading to  women.  And it would never, in the wildest hallucination, you'd never see that.  Or the label.  How about this?  They boycott not only any store that carries those type of lyrics, but any label.  All artists on any label.  The same way they do with advertisers.  And if they have taken on this cause, why don't they take advantage of all the huge exposure 
[03:05:30]  this is getting and jump back on that cause?  No, they'll just have a hip hop song.  If they had taken this cause up, you would have seen art, you would have heard about it,  and artists would not, certain artists wouldn't be in stores anymore.  They've never, they do the bullshit summits.  Yep.  And it's just more phony.  We can't yell at Young Brothers nonsense.  We have to talk to them gently.  It's nonsense.  It is.  Did we tape the view?  On the view, they were making reference to shock jocks such as Howard Stern and Opie  and Howie.  Opie and Howie? 
[03:06:00]  Please tell me that's true.  They just never get it right with me.  I love it.  Rosie wasn't fired for Ching Chong's.  No.  Ching Chong's.  That's just as bad.  And once again, we say that Rosie should be able to say that.  Absolutely.  I should be able to say.  And Snoop should be able to do what he does.  Exactly.  I like what he does.  He annoys people.  People find him to be offensive.  Here's more whoopee.  Yeah.  If he was black, would it have been okay?  No.  Those parents would have been on him much faster if he had been black. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, stop it.  Bullshit.  Because you don't, you know, you don't, you don't do that.  So do you think he should be fired from radio permanently or from MSNBC?  You know, I think a little vacation would be in order.  More than two.  More than two weeks.  But I tell you, you know, my true feeling is if we've taken other people to task and  fired them, because a lot of people have gotten fired over doing this kind of thing,  then what are we saying if they don't fire him? 
[03:07:00]  I'll tell you what we're saying.  You can have a boyfriend who puts on blackface and then eventually have a sitcom and still  have a great career.  I guess that's what we're saying.  How fucking phony is Whoopi?  You're a fucking comedian, you dope.  You didn't want to talk about the Ted Danson thing because that would prove what a hypocrite  you are?  This segment's going to end with that beautiful moment we had yesterday.  Holy shit, is she a phony.  And so are all these fucking stupid Anderson Cooper, this fucking tranny lover. 
[03:07:30]  I just made that up, but he looks like one.  And if he's not, he should be.  Anderson in the pooper.  How old are you?  I know.  It comes right down to third grade here.  Yeah.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You've been on both sides of this.  You've been in the center of a firestorm and you are watching this as well.  What's your advice to Imus?  The best advice I can give to him, get over to that campus, get over to those parents and  those kids and make some allies and really, you know, talk about whatever was happening, 
[03:08:00]  what you thought you were doing and be honest.  He's got to be honest.  He's been doing that.  You see the way he fucking tapped ass around it?  You've had some controversy.  She probably said, I don't want to talk about that.  And he didn't go near it.  Another case where a black person being spoken to is not called out on the absolute fucking  contradiction of their own behavior.  There's apologies before questions.  Oh, my God. 
[03:08:30]  It's crazy, man.  The fucking white people are just dishonest fruits.  Well, we're going to go to break with our little conversation with Whoopi yesterday.  We're scared.  We tried to discuss this with Whoopi and then Jimmy brought up the Ted Danson incident and  you'll hear her saying to her producer, hang up, hang up, hang up.  I know.  You know what she'll hear?  How warm?  Excuse me.  What happened?  How warm is that?  It's pretty warm.  Medium iced latte with soy.  Perfect.  Thanks.  Appreciate it.  All right. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, no.  Yes, you certainly will.  Oh, boy.  He fucked up again.  I don't know.  I say medium iced latte eight times and he brings me back one that fucking is piping hot.  I couldn't even touch it.  It was piping hot.  It was like a fucking a little coffee soup.  I truly hate our listeners.  Why?  This is really funny.  Kyle from Virginia.  How about a two-year vacation followed by a year or two of staying on XM before he's  allowed to go back to FM?  Yeah.  How about that? 
[03:09:30]  And then he writes, I'd update it.  That should be fair, right?  Tee hee.  Tee hee.  Tee hee.  Tee hee.  All right.  Ant did tell the joke.  He told the joke at the end of the show.  He brought it all together.  Oh, don't you worry about it, you dopes.  All right.  Here's what we'll be getting on our show yesterday.  What he said was not illegal.  What he said was not, I think, affineable. 
[03:10:00]  But it was wrong.  It was morally wrong.  All right.  So you say it's wrong.  Should he be fired for that?  Do I think he should be fired?  He should be fired as much as Trent Lott was fired.  As much as Jimmy the Greek was fired.  Well, you're insane.  These are the consequences.  Richard Rush Limbaugh got fired.  Jimmy the Greek wasn't a comedian when he said what he said.  I can't hear you.  The bottom line is, when you look at something like Cheryl Underwood, look at the type of  material she does and the things she goes after.  Why is it?  I don't know who you're talking about.  Cheryl Underwood, she's a black female comic.  Uh-huh.  And she goes after race pretty hard. 
[03:10:30]  She drops N-bombs.  Do you have a radio show?  Doesn't matter.  We're talking about the right.  No, no.  Excuse me.  No, no.  I'm interested.  I don't know.  Why should radio show hosts that do a comedy show be held to higher standards?  Okay.  As like network news.  Are you crazy?  Listen, man.  We should be able to say whatever the hell we want when we do our program.  Excuse me.  God bless you.  Now, I'm willing to listen to you, but you know what?  If you're going to talk over me, I don't know who Cheryl Norton is, so I can't comment  on what she does.  No, Cheryl Underwood.  Not Cheryl Norton. 
[03:11:00]  Cheryl Underwood.  No, Underwood.  You're Norton.  Yes.  Oh, sorry.  Jeez.  Hey, what about Ted Danson?  I don't want to comment on her because I don't know what she does.  I'm having a conversation with you.  Whoopi, what about the Ted Danson instance?  I mean, you guys caught.  You were making a racial point.  No, no, no.  But I'm saying.  Oh, hang up.  See?  See?  Because you said the Ted Danson thing.  Why would she hang up on that?  Oh, another pussy.  Why would she hang up on that?  Holy cow.  Why would she hang up with the Ted Danson thing?  Another knockout punch for the boys.  But why would she hang up on that? 
[03:11:30]  That was a very legitimate question.  That is an absolute valid point.  How come it was okay when Ted Danson got in blackface and she came to his defense and  that was considered very offensive, very racist.  And she came to his defense on that, but she will say that Imus should be fired for doing  what he did, which was a bad joke.  And I wasn't even attacking her with that.  My point was how can you defend one aspect of racial parody, but not another aspect of 
[03:12:00]  it?  When you're involved with it because you're black, it's okay.  Hang up.  Hang up.  You hear her?  Hang up, Ted Danson.  Hang up.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  It's not nude.  It's just girls flashing guys that have W-O-W on their vehicles somewhere.  That's the WOW campaign.  Wow.  For details on how to get your very own WOW sticker, go to opieandandthony.com.

I coached so, Danny, and he's a rookie, and it's an awfully good football team, so if there  was an interest, sure, you'd have an interest.  This is The Drive.

Oh, is she corrected?  Opie and Anthony.  You know why Rosie didn't know?  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, she knows.  Oh, she probably knows all too well.  Yeah.  The bus retard when we plugged that movie.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:18:00]  Opie and Howie.  Opie and Howie, whatever.  Whatever.  That's funny.  All right, uh...  I know.  We're going to move on tomorrow.  I think, uh, less IMUS coverage tomorrow, I believe.  I think it's going to come down a little bit.  Because I don't know.  I'm just kidding.  I believe, but...  It's calm and down.  Hey, uh, the Dow's down, Than said, because of the IMUS controversy.  Um, is that it?  It must be true.  Than said it.  Yeah, Than is a smart kid.  Yeah.  The price of IMUS is going to go up.  And we got the presidential candidates, uh, commenting about IMUS. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  I didn't hear it.  I...  It's good.  What'd they say?  It didn't mean anything.  Buy it.  Do you think it's one of these?  I was only...  Or one of them.  No, I was only joking.  Which one do you think?  Uh...  This or this?  I'll say...  This or...  Middle finger.  Oh!  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, but if it was a good one, you'd stop the show and make sure we all know.  Well, that's the rules.  Yeah, I know.  All right, here we go.  Uh, presidential candidates about IMUS. 
[03:19:00]  We start with, uh, ooh, talking about IMUS.  Bush and Obama issue statements.  Really?  It was several days before any of the 08ers said a word about Don IMUS.  Once he apologized, it got easier because nobody had to go out on a limb.  The president believes that the apology was the absolute right thing to do.  The suspension also helped loosen things up.  Shortly after it was announced yesterday IMUS would be off the air for two weeks, Barack Obama issued a written statement. 
[03:19:30]  The comments of Don IMUS were divisive, hurtful, and offensive to Americans of all backgrounds.  Really?  All right, I mean, he's got to say something.  Was it really?  Yeah, I wasn't hurt.  All Americans?  Don't lump me into that.  Wasn't it of all backgrounds?  No.  Honestly?  Really?  Don't lump me into the all American category in that case.  I wasn't offended at all.  See, they have to comment because they're the type of people that go on his show.  Yeah.  But why can't he say most Americans, some Americans?  African Americans?  Don't say all Americans.  I'm American and I completely disagree. 
[03:20:00]  I don't care.  You don't care.  You're an American and you want them to take it farther.  That way for me to wave my fist in a mediocre joke.  Sorry.  Trying to put it over with the old fist raising.  Yeah, like start the rally.  Chris Dodd.  Some in the 08 field appear regularly on the show.  Chris Dodd announced his candidacy there.  Today he wrote,  As the father of two young girls, I can imagine how hurtful these comments were to these young women and their parents.  The comments were wrong and unacceptable. 
[03:20:30]  All right.  Okay.  Kind of how you have to put, what are you going to say as a politician?  Look, did you see those bitches?  That.  He did good.  John McCain and Hillary?  Opinions on whether IMUS should get more than a two week suspension are scarce.  John McCain, a frequent IMUS guest, haunted.  He has apologized.  He said that he's deeply sorry.  I'm a great believer in redemption.  Hillary Clinton, who originally issued a fairly cautious response, later revved up, coming closest to saying IMUS shouldn't be on the air. 
[03:21:00]  You know, I've been on the receiving end of a lot of his barbs.  So, you know, I understand I'm a public figure, but it just went way over the line.  Get it, really?  How about marrying someone who shoves a cigar in a young girl's cunt?  What do you think that stands, sweetie?  Is that way over the line?  Yeah, is that over the line, or is that something we have to forgive as a country?  Shut up, phony voice.  Yo, what's up, my niggas?  I'm running for possessor, Dan.  Shut your fucking fat-ankled face, bitch. 
[03:21:30]  Possessor.  She makes me sick.  Insulting black people by talking like them, you fucking phony.  Did JFK do that shit?  I swear, yo, what's up, y'all?  You know, don't ask what your hood can do for you.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Chris in Georgia.  Chris?  Mr. Gorbachev, tear that motherfucking wall down.  What up, Chris?  I ain't no crook. 
[03:22:00]  Aight.  Aight.  Boys, love you, love you, Cheryl.  Yeah.  And I just got to talk to Jimmy for just a second.  Jimmy, you are my hero.  Oh, thank you.  I thought this was going to be hurtful.  No, sir.  No, sir.  How can you be such a naughty, naughty boy in Atlanta?  I would tell you, Cheryl.  Okay.  And be such a brilliant debater.  I mean, you know, I just love how you're so quick with the brilliant answers and the comments.  Well, sir.  Everything brought up.  You know, you've got them dead on balls.  But five minutes later, you're farting in the mic. 
[03:22:30]  God, you're my hero.  Thank you, sir.  I think the answer for you is that basically I am a gift from God to you.  Yes.  I mean you as an American, as a group.  You represent God.  No, but, dude, it's like.  In every sense of the word.  It's not that hard to argue that point.  I mean, and I would love to take the credit for being that.  But farting in the mic, I'm good at.  Yeah.  Because it's easy and I'm a hack.  And debating, like, free speech is pretty simple.  Like, everyone should have it.  Yeah.  Everyone should have it.  Except you.  At least Art has had a pretty face. 
[03:23:00]  Art in Philly, what's up?  He writes, come on, guys, don't stop now.  I think we still need to find out Ben Vereen's take on his situation.  It's fucking amazing, isn't it?  Ben Vereen?  A Ben Vereen joke.  He's now called Grilled Chicken George because of the health craze.  FDR quote coming in.  The only thing we have to fear is the man.  Yeah.  I just heard assimilation into the black vibe was so insulting. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  He's just criminy.  All right, here's that.  Criminy.  Giuliani.  And Rudy Giuliani came closest to letting bygones be bygones.  I would appear on the program again.  Sure.  I would.  I think that I take him at his word.  I take Don at his word that he understands the gravity of what he did.  And on that much, they could all agree.  And that Anderson did Rob Pollack.  The sounds and the fucking...  What the hell is going on on that station?  We're watching a movie. 
[03:24:00]  I'll tell you what's going to save him eventually.  It's going to be the political people.  Because guys, even though Obama didn't trash him that hard, none of them are calling for  him to be fired, really.  Yeah.  So that's a big thing.  Let's go to Josh.  Yeah, that'll help.  Josh.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Thanks for calling, Josh.  Welcome aboard.  Hey, Josh.  Thanks, man.  I'm blushing.  Hey, I got a little comment.  What the fuck is going on with the world when, you know, presidents running, people running  for presidents and all these important people are talking about Don Im is calling a bunch 
[03:24:30]  of black girls and two white girls, which doesn't even make sense, nappy hoes when we're  at war, people are dying.  Is this really the biggest issue?  Well, politicians love distractions like this.  They love this.  It's a huge relief when this ends up on our TV around the clock.  Dude, I'll tell you, I thought the same thing you did as I'm listening to Hillary talk,  but then I also, a minute after that thought, a lot of them do go on his show.  So it's almost like if something happens to O&A, I mean, obviously, they would ask guys 
[03:25:00]  like Voss and Jay.  I mean, in fairness to the media who are just cunts, McCain and those guys are frequent  guests on his show.  Yeah.  So I kind of, I see why they're asking him.  All right.  No, I definitely understand that and, but it's not like, you know, it's not like he ate like  a children, like five black kids.  Sir, it ain't like he ate a children, five black kids.  You lost your point.  What happened?  What happened to you?  He ate them?  Jesus, sir.  No one's accusing him of fucking infanticide.  We're just saying that he was naughty. 
[03:25:30]  Infanticide cannibalism.  I know.  He killed and ate them or did he eat them as he was racist and hungry?  Sorry, I stepped all over you.  That's okay.  I was stepping all over my tongue.  We're going to do a speed round and then we're going to move on and maybe talk a lot  less about this tomorrow.  Dawn in Texas.  What's up?  Yeah, I don't know how he can expect any other kind of reaction.  I feel bad for the guy, but why did he expect this to happen?  What do you mean?  Well, I'm saying, why does he think he can say it and not have the reaction that he got? 
[03:26:00]  I'm not saying it's right.  I'm saying it's...  Dawn, are you saying that he shouldn't have said it or that people shouldn't have reacted?  You're making like two different points.  Are you saying that he shouldn't have said it or you can't understand why people are mad?  Or you can't understand why he's confused?  No, I'm not saying he's going to have said it.  I'm saying that if he's going to say it, he can expect the reaction to say it. 
[03:26:30]  I mean, I understand that, Dawn, but I mean, there's going to be problems with it, but  it's a freedom of speech issue and I would love you to explain how you don't see this  as a freedom of speech issue.  Yeah, he's dumb for saying it, maybe, but you know, he shouldn't be fired, right?  I understand that he can say it and you can say it and you can say it and you have to  accept the reaction to get it and say it and the bottom line is going to be money and his  sponsors are going to be the ones who... 
[03:27:00]  Yes?  Right.  Way to make my point for me, thank you.  Yeah, that's kind of what Jimmy's been saying.  Exactly, but you're just reiterating and act like you're not.  Yeah.  How is that reiterating?  How is it?  I'm trying to tell you, thank you.  That's exactly what it was.  How is it not reiterating when you're saying that he should be fired?  I didn't think he's fired.  All right, you know what?  Why don't we let Dawn speak here? 
[03:27:30]  Okay, Dawn.  Dawn, speak your mind on the issue.  I just did.  I'm saying, why is he expecting a better reaction?  I can't believe you're actually listening to a broad and what she has to think about.  I mean, I should be able to walk through Harlem at midnight, but I can't.  Cunt.  Yeah.  I agree.  Yeah.  So what should happen to Mr. Imus?  Well, I mean...  Cunt.  Ideally, we'd like to see you just go away, but that's not going to happen.  Quiet, cunt.  All right.  He should have been smart enough to see... 
[03:28:00]  Shh.  Shh.  ...doing something like that.  Shh.  Stop.  Shh.  Right.  All right, Dawn, thank you for your opinion.  It means a lot to our show.  It's just agree to disagree.  All right.  Godspeed.  All right.  Right.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve?  Hey, love you.  Love the show, man.  Thanks.  Listen up.  What are you guys going to stop talking about Imus and start talking about Howard?  Hmm? 
[03:28:30]  Ramon!  Jimmy should die of shushing!  Shushing!  Sir, no one has died of shushing in six weeks.  He should die of sh...  He Ramoned, shushed, and frunkished.  And then frunkished, dude.  That's fucking the trifecta.  Anthony's big day tomorrow.  That was put off, right?  Of course it was.  What's the matter?  Anthony's big day was put off.  Oh.  All right.  My court.  My court.  Let's go to James in Jersey.  James? 
[03:29:00]  Hey, Opie and Howie.  What's going on?  Tom and Howie.  Whatever.  Listen, I don't remember the last time I heard the phrase, nappy-headed hoe, before Imus.  Yeah.  But I think I've heard it about 10,000 times.  Sin?  Oh, man.  We all added it to our, like, our speech.  And now everybody's going to use it.  Yeah.  Because it's fun.  Yeah, and I think before the week's over, it's going to be elevated to the N-word.  It'll be the N-P-word.  I was in Starbucks just yesterday going, hurry up, you nappy-headed hoe.  Oh, get me my favorite.  I got places to go. 
[03:29:30]  I got white places to go.  Yeah.  Wow.  And that's what it was.  What, Jimmy?  What happened?  That's got to be good.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  I apologize.  Jimmy's doing investigative journalism.  I'm just, this is why.  I apologize.  I mean, a rather.  All right, James.  Yeah, we're hearing that a lot.  Thank you.  I'm reading the whoopee thing.  And this was Ted Danson's response.  And Danson is correct about the Friars Club thing.  And she can hide behind, that was in a club, and this is on the airwaves.  This was Ted Danson said, Danson, she said, is hurt and upset that people are taking the  whole matter in such a negative way.  He issued a statement that read, words by themselves are not racist. 
[03:30:00]  Racism is a matter of intent.  And then he goes, my intent was to amuse my dear friend, whoopee, in a way I thought  was the privacy of the Friars Club.  Those people who, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Words by themselves are not racist.  Racism is a matter of intent.  Of intent.  There you go.  And whoopee completely co-signs for that.  And then, of course, all these years later, instead of using that same thing to defy this, 
[03:30:30]  who didn't do anything as extreme with blackface, she fucking said, well, there's been  precedent set.  Really?  Wow.  You phony.  God, whoopee.  Hypocrisy.  I hate fucking, we're all, like, inconsistent at times.  We all got a bit.  Yeah, I mean, of course.  Some more than others.  Sure, darkies.  Yeah.  What?  What did I agree to?  We get tired this time of day.  I know.  We can't be responsible for agreeing.  Well, it's actually when you say that and no one laughs like it was a fucking point statement 
[03:31:00]  I made.  I'm just kidding.  Wow.  I've been getting this all day, and I got to tell you, God bless Kenny, but the write-in  today, Jimmy?  Yes.  He goes, you know, when I miss his off those two weeks, you guys should have him on the  show.  Oh, Kenny.  Really right.  That's an excellent idea.  And I had to talk to him like I'm wearing, like, kid gloves to make sure that I tell him  it's a good idea, but why it would never happen.  But he was all excited as soon as I stepped in. 
[03:31:30]  You know, I got an idea.  He should be in those two weeks doing the show with you guys.  Just imagine the exposure you would get.  Like, Kenny, that would never happen.  Wow.  Goldberg said, American public has known for some time that she is no saint.  I'm the woman who made motherfucker a household word.  I am no saint.  I've always been known as the other side of tasteful.  Okay.  That's really, and again, I like her for that. 
[03:32:00]  But the nerve of you to pride yourself on that and have such a great career and one I'm  is fired for being tasteless in his humor.  Mm-hmm.  Jesus Christ.  Other entertainers are fucking crucifying this guy.  I'm trying to hide behind the fact that she didn't know he did a comedy show.  And she doesn't think he does a comedy show.  For Danson's finale, a waiter brought out a tray of watermelon, which Danson wolfed down. 
[03:32:30]  Holy shit.  Man.  When Goldberg got her chance for rebuttal at the end of the X-rated evening, she opened  with nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, whitey, whitey, whitey, whitey.  It takes a whole lot of courage to come out in blackface in front of 3,000 people, she  stated emphatically.  I don't care if you don't like it.  I do.  She said those who lashed out at Danson should have been familiar with the private club's 
[03:33:00]  89 year of history of revolved roasts and expected jokes to focus on sex, gender,  bodily functions, race, religion, and race.  Just like Imus' 40 year career of goofing on bodily functions, religion, race, gender,  sex.  And what she will say is, well that was a private club, but that is not, first of all,  he didn't do anything that was that over the top.  A fucking Klan meeting is a private club.  Yeah.  You know, it's the intent.  The bottom line is, it's your personal thing.  You defended Ted vehemently against charges. 
[03:33:30]  You didn't say, yes, Ted's a racist, but it was private.  You were saying he's not, and that's ridiculous.  And yet you won't give Imus that courtesy on one little line.  She just knows.  That's why she hung up.  You're damn right that's why she hung up.  She knows that she's got no defense.  She couldn't defend that.  Dave in New York, what's up?  Hey, I had an idea.  It sounds like C-Man had Kenny.  I already got him to do it.  Bring Don and Imus on all Monday.  You know?  He would never come on our show.  No, no, he's right.  Do you think we can get Imus on Monday?  Should we question him, or should we let him just say what he wants? 
[03:34:00]  Why?  Get up, stupid.  You don't know anything.  All right, let's go adjust it in L.A.  Oh, that's not wonderful.  Hey, by the way, Tom from Philly, he writes,  Worst part is I put the Ben Vereen line in under a fake name expecting a good trashing.  I stink.  No, we left our asses on that one reference.  Come on.  Ben Vereen references always good on the show.  That's a good one.  Go ahead, Justin.  Yes, so Imus is in trouble first saying that nappy-headed hoes. 
[03:34:30]  Is nappy-headed an adjective or is it a racist thing?  Or are we getting pissed off at the term hoes?  Well, it's kind of being...  Unless I read it wrong, hoes is a derogatory against women, not black, so...  Well, that's why women are mad.  Justin, it's coming from two fronts.  There's definitely a female angle happening here and also a racist angle.  I would say more racist than female, by the way.  Yeah, definitely.  Is John McCain going to get pissed off if you call him bald? 
[03:35:00]  No, you know, eventually you won't be able to make fun of someone's baldness.  Of anything, yeah.  That's probably pretty far down on the list, though.  Yeah, you know.  We'll be retired by then.  First, it'll be blackballed people.  And then, you know...  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to be good.  Because everything's got to be black first.  Yeah.  Black people with hair lips.  Yeah.  Like that.  You won't be able to make fun of them.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, how are you?  What's up, boys?  What up?  You're supposed to say welcome to the program, Jeff.  Hey, Jeff, welcome to... 
[03:35:30]  That's not me.  Welcome to the program.  Thank you, gentlemen.  I just wanted to let you know that CNN is airing a Wolf Blitzer piece explaining two  factors as to why Whoopi is all over the airwaves.  Yeah.  Her ratings are so poor, and she's so black.  Thank you, boys.  Punch it out.  Yeah, Wolf never took any heat from that.  Because his intent wasn't hateful.  We covered a lot of things today.  We really did.  Imus, Imus, Imus, Imus. 
[03:36:00]  We did the Larry Burkhead as the baby's father.  We did...  What else did we do?  The Duke charges were dropped today.  Oh, mm-hmm.  And the astronaut, crazy astronaut, brought...  There's an update on her.  I love her.  What the hell is she doing back in the news?  This is a great update.  A strange case of a diaper-wearing NASA astronaut driving...  Diaper-wearing?  ...to Florida to allegedly confront and kidnap a romantic rival has taken another strange turn.  Newly released documents in the case against Lisa Nowak show that a police search of Nowak's 
[03:36:30]  car turned up a computer disk containing bondage images, British currency, and pills.  Some of the bondage images showed a nude woman.  There were photos and drawings.  It's not clear whether any of the images show Nowak.  Police also found about $600, 41 British pounds, and four brown paper towels with 69 orange pills.  Tests are being done to determine what the pills are.  Police have previously said they found a BB gun, a steel mallet, a knife, and rubber tubing in Nowak's possession. 
[03:37:00]  Fucking MacGyver.  Nowak was arrested in February after police say she drove from Houston to Orlando to confront Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman.  Shipman was dating another NASA astronaut, Bill Opheline.  Opheline and Nowak had been romantically linked before that.  Nowak has pleaded not guilty to several charges.  She's been released from NASA's astronaut corps.  Her trial has been moved to September.  If I could go out on a limb, and I'm going to say that a steel mallet is not going to be used for good.  No, no.  This is going to be some...  She's not going to be knocking wood planks into place. 
[03:37:30]  I think there's going to be blood and some hair left on the mallet.  Yeah.  I mean, it is.  And you know the prosecutor will be questioning her.  One of the questions, she'll say,  Why then were no croquet balls found?  See, you throw the women in there with the men astronauts, look what happens.  Yep.  Nutty bitch one.  She went crazy.  She was fucking the astronaut guy, and then he starts banging another broad, and she goes  crazy.  Puts on a diaper and tries to whack her head in with a mallet.  Bet she sucked it in space. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  She sucked his cock.  Imagine what a money shot looks like in zero gravity.  Yeah.  Just goes all over the place.  You're trying to do your work, and these bubbles that come are hitting you in the face.  What the hell is...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I know.  I must have died and went to heaven.  That's what you say.  Cum bubbles all over the damn place.  Cum bubbles hitting the fucking instruments.  This is my new character.  It's called Unfunny and Uninteresting.  Oh, shit.  I don't like Jimmy's characters.  Oh, die, you nameless faggot.  I don't like Jimmy's characters. 
[03:38:30]  Not only are they going to write about it, they're going to name that character Opie.  Oh.  Oh.  Fucking douchebags.  After fucking 13 years, they still have no clue what I do for this show.  Go fuck yourself.  Beated cunt.  Why do you want to know my name?  Go fuck your mother.  You know, I don't want to make a big to-do out of this.  And don't worry, because I love when I say something, people just start darting all over 
[03:39:00]  the place to appease me like I'm fucking...  Oh, no.  I need something.  What do you need?  I don't need it.  I was just hoping it's not missing.  Like, I hope it made the trip from CBS over to here.  My bullhorn, my wacky whistle, my other little things.  How is that stuff not put out for you?  I don't know.  It usually is.  I give people the benefit of the doubt when it's just one time.  Well, you know what?  My stuff wasn't out this morning either.  None of the sheets were out.  I don't need it.  You know, show's almost over. 
[03:39:30]  I truly...  I truly thought he was going to say sheet.  What?  Yeah.  My white sheet is missing, and I just want to make sure it was there and didn't get lost.  He actually...  Oh, Travis is actually...  Oh, Travis?  They sent Travis in because they know I'd never yell at young Travis.  Travis, what happened?  They weren't.  I think you should find yourself.  My mind's somewhere else, son.  What's the matter?  What happened?  No.  I was at home.  What happened?  Nothing happened.  We just have a lot to do with the IMA stuff and everything, and it just did... 
[03:40:00]  We're giving them too much work.  That's what that meant.  Resign on the air.  How many interns...  Resign right now.  Resign.  Right now.  Resign.  What?  I tender my resignation.  Tender.  What a dumb word.  That is a tender reservation.  I'm sorry.  Resignation.  People...  Excuse me.  Reservation.  People are wondering what...  Ah, the Greaseman's take would be on this.  Ah.  We might have to wait till tomorrow.  Waddle doodle.  I'm sure he'd say something like waddle doodle and... 
[03:40:30]  Because someone needs a nappy.  Bone dry.  He'd say bone dry.  He would say, no wonder they drag them behind...  Oh, should I say that?  And then we'd cut him off before he actually says it so we don't get in trouble.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodogfight.com's upcoming pay-per-view, Clash of the Nations.  Bodog, yeah.  If you can't make the Las Vegas virus tour on the 14th, tickets still available for the virus tour.  Yep.  What do you think for?  And everyone I talk to is saying that it will sell out.  Because what?  They buy their tickets last minute or something? 
[03:41:00]  In Vegas, yes.  Because a lot of people don't live in Vegas.  They travel there the day or two before the show.  That's why even...  There's certain showrooms that are dark on Friday.  Yeah.  Because people come to Vegas on Friday.  You don't want to go on that night.  Oh, I...  Sorry.  Sorry.  But do you know what?  Sorry.  Do you know how to get tickets?  I wouldn't say how to get tickets.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you meant from HBO shoot.  Yeah.  That's what we did mean.  No, it's not about me.  Excuse me.  One thought at a time.  That's what you learned in broadcasting school.  Okay.  So now we decide what thought we want to do.  One shit at a time.  I say what you're traveling virus.  We got to push the traveling virus hard tomorrow. 
[03:41:30]  On the other end, especially.  Okay.  Yeah, you push it hard.  Okay.  I'll just talk about that.  Travis is shaking his head.  Dude, can you touch butts with somebody today?  I am tired.  Can I...  Okay.  How about with Cromwell?  Hey, can I...  If I touch butts, can I plug at the end of the show?  Absolutely.  Okay, Cromwell.  Plug your butts.  Cromwell, get in here.  Get in here.  It's butt touching time.  Cromwell.  Jimmy's new bit.  Jimmy's new bit.  Quickly, Cromwell.  We're going to do this one more time.  Get in here, Cromwell.  Cromwell was the only one that showed up today. 
[03:42:00]  Come on.  He was the one-man studio audience.  God, you're too...  All right.  What a fag.  You're too...  You're too eager to do this.  Come on, Cromwell.  Let's go.  You're too tall.  Quickly, it's just my buttocks.  All right.  We're doing a little butt rubbing.  Jimmy's butt is hanging over his...  Ew, Jimmy.  Come on.  Come on.  Calm down.  Ew.  He farted in his butt.  Jimmy can fart on cue.  If it fucking...  If the air just made his glasses fly off. 
[03:42:30]  Or if I did it and he went...  What happened?  He went...  Nothing.  And the fart came out of his mouth.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Now go write something nice about me today.  That's your job.  Of course.  All right.  Just to make me feel better.  Cromwell.  Cromwell.  So long.  Cromwell.  Thanks a lot for coming in.  Adios.  Cromwell.  All right.  Get the plug, Jimmy.  I will be shooting my...  Okay. 
[03:43:00]  I will be shooting my one...  It's one...  I'm just doing the abbreviation.  HBO special.  June 2nd.  I've chosen Washington, D.C., which is why I canceled the improv.  People have been asking me and I've been hinting.  Two shows at the Lincoln Theater.  Saturday, June 2nd.  Tickets go to jimnortonatbroadwayvideo.com.  State which of the shows you want to go to early or late.  Tuesday!  No.  Oh, what?  Which of the shows you want to go to early or late. 
[03:43:30]  Oh.  Oh.  And it's the...  It's...  You put your email address, your name, and I think a phone number or whatever, and they  will contact you.  Tickets will obviously be gone because these are free tickets.  And I'm Jim Norton.  And I'm shooting one...  Arr.  Arr.  All right.  Let that sink in, everybody out there in Radio L.  That's for June 2nd, and that's in D.C.  Now?  Now.  What about Vegas this weekend?  Ah.  Well, it's in the next plug here.  Line of the Day brought to you by Bodogfight.com's upcoming pay-per-view Clash of the Nations. 
[03:44:00]  If you can't make the Las Vegas Virus Tour on the 14th, tickets still available through  Ticketmaster.  All the info on our website.  Eight, nine comedians.  What else is going on there?  Oh, the press conference.  Press conference.  The hanging by the pool.  It's Bob Kelly.  It's going to be a hanging by the pool?  Yeah.  That's why Patrice is on the show.  I don't know.  I couldn't get the bell.  That's okay.  I don't need it.  Why would you have one?  Travis is too busy galloping.  Panting around.  Well, it's part of our I miss protest.  Yeah.  Our buddy Patrice is finally on the show.  Bobby Kelly, Richard Voss.  It's a whole thing, though. 
[03:44:30]  The press conference around two o'clock by the pool at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  We're going to be doing that.  Probably get really fucked up before the show.  Then do the show.  Then do some gambling.  Then jump on a plane.  It's a big deal.  I'm exhausted already.  Ticketmaster.com for tickets.  But I think there were less than 300 tickets from a sellout.  So I think we're close to 1,000 people sold already, right?  More than that.  More than that?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Okay.  Well, if you're not going to that, then make sure to catch this showdown of the world's  most skilled mixed martial arts fighters.  For more info, check out bowdogfight.com slash PPV. 
[03:45:00]  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  It's myself and Sigourney Weaver and Ewan Griffith and Judy Greer and just really terrific,  smart, funny actors.  Justin Bateman.  Justin Bateman.  He's great in everything he does.  Justine.  Oh, Justine?  I saw Justin.  He dresses like a girl.  It's amazing.  Well, she's okay, too.  Oh, that was...  Oh, go fuck yourself.  God, that was crazy. 
[03:45:30]  It was so perfect.  It was like the perfect broadcast name.  It was like...  Justin Bateman.  It was like a fucking...  Justin Bateman.  I enjoy all of his work.  That was funny, man.  I celebrate his entire catalog.  It was just like...  It was like congressional testimony.  It was so perfectly said.  You know, in the moment, I wasn't able to really absorb how great that was.  Me neither.  Because it was like...  Can we hear that again?  We rarely hear a runner-up line of the day twice.  But I got to hear that again.  I'm finally...  It was funny. 
[03:46:00]  I'm finally part of the line of the day.  And it's...  It was funny.  It's one that makes me look like a complete...  It's funny.  Because then you back it up with how much you like the guy that isn't in the movie.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, like I've seen everything he does.  And the guy that doesn't really exist.  Because it's Jason.  Yeah, there's no Justin Bateman.  Yeah, you're Jason.  Jason.  Yeah.  Please.  It's myself and Sigourney Weaver and Ewan Griffith and Judy Greer.  And just really terrific, smart, funny actors.  Justin Bateman?  Justin Bateman.  He's great in everything he does. 
[03:46:30]  Justine.  Oh, Justine?  I saw Justin.  When he dresses like a girl, it's amazing.  Well, she's okay.  And then I just go, Justine.  Like, no one will notice.  But Justine.  And it does get mortified if we don't know our shit when it comes to the guests.  Oh, is that funny?  Oh, is that a funny one?  All the confidence in the world.  Justin?  That's what was funny about it is the way it came out.  Oh, yeah.  His name's not even Justin.  He doesn't exist.  He's a guy from Boston.  It was so perfectly, it was basic and perfect. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Thanks to BodogFight.com.  I wanted to congratulate you boys with that fucking smashing overhand right to whoopee eyebrowless  face yesterday.  Welcome back to the program, Jay Moore.  Jay Moore's back for the first time in months and he gets the line of the day.  Jay's a rare case, man.  He's really funny on the phone.  Like, Jay kills on the fucking phone, man.  He's great.  That doesn't sound like much of a compliment. 
[03:47:30]  You've got to explain it further.  Most comedians suck on the phone.  Most comedians, it's really hard.  I've done many phoners.  It's hard to be funny on the phone.  Say what you mean.  He sucks when he comes in.  No.  No.  That's not what I mean.  That's what Jimmy said, though.  No, Jay is great when he calls.  It's very difficult to be good on the phone.  Yeah.  And he fucking kills on the phone.  It's not.  It's easy to be good on the phone.  You just do a regular call, give all the information, and hang up.  That's true.  With no punchline.  You've got a douche.  Can we say how big mook?  Hey, big mook. 
[03:48:00]  Hey, mook.  What up?  What up?  What up?  As-salamu alaykum, yo.  As-salamu alaykum, Salam.  I was checking y'all out today.  I'm usually listening to y'all, but I listened to y'all today with an open mind, and I want  y'all to know that I agree with a lot of what you said, and I'm tired of, like, Al Sharpton  and Jesse Jackson trying to slide into a leader of the black community, and they're not.  They don't represent us.  You didn't vote for them.  You need a...  Excuse me?  You didn't vote for them.  Man, they don't support me.  I mean, they don't stand for me. 
[03:48:30]  They don't talk for me.  They don't talk for my community, and any time you need a supportive black man, if y'all  want to, you know, do something for this, you know, this man, Imus, I'm down with y'all.  I think we're going to have to do something for Imus.  We're just trying to figure out what.  Maybe we get something together for Friday, but I don't know.  Can we organize that quickly?  No.  No.  Probably not.  Well, I can get a few brothers down with me.  All right.  I can imagine.  Big mook.  Some hard pipe-hitting niggas.  Big mook, I got a question for you.  You said that you don't usually listen to us.  Why did you start listening to us the last couple days? 
[03:49:00]  Well, you know, you're kind of funny.  You know, I've been checking y'all in my car.  Sometimes I get in and I tune y'all in, but, you know, it ain't too much on the radio to  listen to.  I feel we listen to too much, you know, music.  So, I want to listen to a little bit of the news going on, and I really can't dig what's  going on in the regular media.  So, you know, I like a little comedy.  You know, I don't get my feelings hurt.  Who turned you on to the show, though?  Were you just spinning around?  Oh, just tuning through, you know, checking stuff out.  All right.  Well, thanks, man.  Hey, big mook. 
[03:49:30]  Thank you, bro.  You got it, man.  Thanks, man.  By the way, Eric B. from New Hampshire.  Jay's really funny on the phone.  Of course, he's had a lot of practice on Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  All right.  Those guys.  I might have to be someone's best man, by the way.  I'm going to miss the bachelor party.  Oh, well, well.  I wasn't invited.  I got to be.  You weren't invited to?  No.  You saw Dave's bachelor party?  Why would I be?  Why would the other show acknowledge me?  It's actually a, it was a running invite for everybody on this show.  Oh, cool.  It didn't run into my house. 
[03:50:00]  It fucking jogged right past me and waved.  Jimmy Norton upset Ron and Fez people.  Yeah, I mean, it's like, I don't know Eastside Dave well.  I've met him a couple of times.  I think he's very funny on the show when I've heard him.  Uh-huh.  I enjoy seeing him around the office.  I'll always throw out a big hello.  And a little invite to the bachelor party would have been nice as a friend and as a comrade  and a co-worker.  I think I got mine through E-Rock.  I believe E-Rock sent me an email that said, hey, they want to know if you want to go to  the bachelor party.  Oh, cool. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  E-Rock in here now?  In that email?  Yeah.  What did he say?  Why are you screaming?  Because you're upset.  All right.  Why are you sporting wood?  Yeah, let me see.  Eww.  All right.  He better be wrong, man.  How big is your cock?  Nah, he's eating nothing.  Let's touch cocks.  Come on.  Why not?  No.  How big is your cock?  Seriously.  Don't lie.  Don't fucking with your fingers.  You're right.  How big?  You had six?  More.  How fat?  Not very.  How thick?  I write beat it, skinny dick.  Little pencil cock. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, I was just going to say that.  Fucking quilt cock.  Why don't you fucking write the Declaration of Independence on that thing?  Beat it, fucking little dick.  A quilt or quill?  A quill.  But we just cannot fucking...  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Fuck the quilt cock.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Oh, that's great.  No way do you have that.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck you, man.  That's the new you fucked up clip.  Hold on.  Hold on.  A quilt cock.  Maybe in the AIDS sense.  Is my new good one over here, too, or just another one? 
[03:51:30]  The boss's new thing better be there.  Oh, I checked it off.  What?  What?  I'm saying no.  Why does Ann get it not over?  Fuck.  No, I don't...  No, no.  I'm asking where your thing is, too.  Where's the respect?  Get in here, Derek.  Where's the respect?  No, that's Anthony's.  He got it first.  Hold on.  I want to talk to Derek and then paint it on hair.  We fight for clips all the time.  Anthony got that fair and square.  That's it.  I like that one.  But I fought for the beanie...  I want a clip.  You got it on disc? 
[03:52:00]  What are you giving me?  What is that?  Thank you.  What is that, Jimmy?  It's Shaun of the Dead.  I'm rolling four signatures on it for me.  Thanks a lot, jizz face.  Probably did.  Wait.  You gave it to him, too?  No.  All right.  Oh, shit.  It was too loud.  Someone gave it to him.  Oh, the I missed clip is too loud?  Let me try it now.  I'm sorry I did that.  Oh, I'm embarrassed that I did that.  That's a great clip when someone fucks up.  That definitely is.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:52:30]  I did that.  I got the beanie-wearing Jew...  That's a good clip.  I have one...  Oh, no.  Got him.  Got him.  Need him.  Got him.  Need him.  Need him.  Got him.  Got him.  Need him.  We're going to trade, like, baseball cards.  Hey, by the way, when is fucking Jimmy Clip Day?  I want to have a machine for a day with my own clips.  You know something?  Jimmy Clip Day could be good.  It would be good.  But I would have clean ones on CBS, and I would have raucous ones here.  Raucous.  I would have raucous ones over here.  And you would, on CBS side, keep it nice and clean. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  But once we come to XM, I'm going to have raucous ones over here.  And I guarantee some of those clips, when it's done, would be divvied up among the boys.  Oh, so you're talking all new clips.  Oh, but I don't...  You can't use our clips, though.  It'll be all new clips.  I wouldn't use your clips.  You don't understand.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  This is the deal.  All right.  When you're ready for Jimmy Clip Day... 
[03:53:30]  Jimmy Clip Day.  Then you tell us, and we'll do Jimmy Clip Day.  Because...  But it can't be any of the ones we use.  No, you've got to pull all new clips.  Get movie clips, sound clips, whatever you want.  And then it'll be Jimmy Clip Day.  What I need, what I need to make this happen is a program...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  All the clips...  Oh, my...  Ah!  You want me to walk us?  No, what I need...  I need a program that I can get stuff from DVDs.  Because I have a...  How do you say this?  Radio clean.  I have a cunt load. 
[03:54:00]  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Someone call me...  That's a raucous one.  Yo!  That was...  Phone ringing.  Why don't you get my obnoxious...  Fucking...  It's the greatest.  Fuck you, man.  Why?  You had fucking...  I'm a kiddie point on my computer, so I kind of...  Both of which cannot be allowed on Jimmy's Clip...  I like the fucking obnoxious guy left.  I got a new one.  I want...  Shit.  I have a whole bunch of clips.  They're all me.  Is that what it's just going to be? 
[03:54:30]  Jimmy talking.  No, every clip will be a plug.  All right.  National Tennessee.  I should be giving that away.  It's all plugs.  Don't shit, sniffer.  Woodside.  XM 202.  The home of ruckus.  Yeah.  We're going to have a ruckus time.  But instead of calling it the virus, the home of ruckus.  I need a program that I can put a DVD...  All right.  Maybe I can repeat myself an eighth time.  All right.  Do they even make that where you can pull sounds off of a DVD and actually play them on a...  Sorry. 
[03:55:00]  I was going to use that one.  Sorry.  I'm sorry I did that.  That's a good one.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Can't have that one.  Can't have this.  That one.  My colon.  Thank God.  Can't have this.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Don't try to think you can go old school like we forgot that we have this.
